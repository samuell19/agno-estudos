Diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Malaysia are heating up because of a pillow. Thank you, Amran. You are welcome, don't throw it away. Okay. Bye. Bye, guys. Please call me when you land, and call Sita right after, okay? -Say hello to Sita for me. -Will do. Okay. Come on, sweetheart. -Mom. -Yes, princess? Where's Daddy? Daddy? Panji Rindu Alam? Okay. Come on, sweetheart. I don't want to get on the plane before I see Daddy. Why did you say that, darling? Don't you want to see Daddy before we get on the plane, Mom? Nadia, we are late. We have to go now. Okay? Although Daddy isn't here, he's thinking of us. We have to go now, okay? Come on. Don't worry, okay, princess? Look, Mom's brave. Damn.

Pras, is the policeman's daughter pretty? -Forget it. -What? You want to date her, too? I thought you wanted to be with Sheila? Four, Har. Four. It's simple. Men can have four. Here's your four. You can't even convince one, and you want four? You talk too much. Ouch. Sheila! Oh, no. Stop! You really are talented. What do you think? Thank you. Peter, I want to show you something. Here. Is this genuine from Indonesia? Yeah, it is. Jokowi wears a ring like this. Who is Jokowi? Our President. How much? One Million Forint. I could go to Indonesia with that kind of money. I have to go to the airport. How about 500 thousand Forint? Mrs. Arini? I'm Panji. Panji Rindu Alam. The committee assigned me to accompany you while you're here. Sorry, I'm not Arini. I am from Malaysia. Oh, Malaysia. Sheila, Sheila. Malaysia. I thought this is going to be a long summer. Here, let me take your suitcase. I don't know you! I'm Panji. It's okay, let me take your suitcase. Don't mess with me! Sorry, miss. -Panji! -Where are you, Ms. Sheila? Hello? Panji. I have been waiting for so long at the airport... Where are you, exactly? Don't panic, tell me where you are exactly? -Airport! -I'm at the airport, too. You're definitely not in the prayer room. Exactly where are you? How many times do I have to tell you? We are near the stairs. -Under the stairs. -The stairs, the stairs. I'm here below the stairs. I'm touching it now. -The stairs. -Where are you? -Hello? Which stairs? -I'm touching the stairs right now. The stairs can't go anywhere. Sheila? -I'm Panji. -I'm Arini. You're late! Just got done being a dog. I mean, I was dubbing as a dog, for a TV show. So, what are you, a voice actor or a tour guide? I can be everything. Tour guide, driver, travel agent. Here's a Hungarian tulip for you Sheila. -This is fake. -But it's waterproof. Who are you looking for? The driver. Sheila, where did you find this person? Welcome to Budapest. I'm the driver. Surprised, right? I'm Panji Rindu Alam, who will show you the most beautiful city in Eastern Europe. Enjoy it. Budapest is made up of two cities. Buda and Pest. And they are connected by a bridge across the Danube river. The population is approximately 3.3 million. This city is one of the most popular destinations in Europe. For tourists like you. Panji, we are not here for a vacation. We are invited by the Muslim Community of Dar As-Salam Mosque. One of the members published Mrs. Arini's book. Many young adults here really like Mrs. Arini's book. -Even though they are non-Muslims. -Really? Thank God. Okay. This is the apartment. There are about 28 thousand Muslims here. And the numbers keep increasing. Because of the book Palace of Stars? No. Because there are a lot of problems. Come on. -Peace be with you. -Peace be with you. The room is over here. The kitchen is over there. Nadia, look. Here. There's a train. Hello! My field of generosity continues here, my love. I am now at the center of ancient Turkish glory in Europe. Although Islam is underestimated here. Because of all the stories in the news the Moslems here appear to be united. What makes them interested in Islam? Praise God. Hon, I think I can gather useful information here for my book. So, how are you? Terrible connection! Har, you said you already increased the capacity. How should I know? I'm not the internet guy. If you want a good signal, go to the roof. What? I am looking into the raw material prices. Materials from Syria? I'm sure you're going to send the budget to Mr. George late. That's why I already sent a rough estimate this afternoon. Hey, you're taking over my work. You can't do that! Pras, you have to fire him! He's taking over my work. He can't do that, Pras. I won't accept it. If you had not been wasting time stalking Sheila's Facebook, you might have finished your work. That's a lie. -It's true! -You lied! -Burn him! -Who? -Burn him! -Burn what? Stop it! I was the one who asked Hartono to send the rough estimate earlier. So Mr. George would have an idea. But you still need to finish your work tonight, Ran. Send it tomorrow morning. -All right. -I'm leaving now. Eat that. -Here, I'm eating it. -Chew it. -Mrs. Arini? -Yes. I request you to read this book to my friends. Sorry, I'm... -Arini. -Syarief Kristof. I am an oncologist here. Oh, wow. So, you are an Indonesian doctor who practices here? My mother is from Semarang. She met my father, a Hungarian, when he was studying in Yogyakarta. I often read this book aloud to my friends as part of their "treatment." So, it would be very special if today the author herself could read the book. Treatment? What do you mean? Mrs. Arini's schedule is full. -Maybe if tomorrow... -Mom and I will be there. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. May I have your autograph, please? Yes, sure. Again, thank you for your time, ma'am. You're welcome. I'll be there. So, kids... Here beside me is Mrs. Citra Arini. She is the author of Palace of Stars. Now, she will read her novel to us. What could be more beautiful than the twinkle of stars at night? I asked my mom before going to sleep. Kids... Michela is asleep. We can continue after this. Oh, my God. I would like to thank you, Mrs. Arini. You made Michela's dream come true. Dream? Michela really liked Palace of Stars. And during every chemotherapy session, she would want someone to read the book to her. Her last wish was to meet the author. That's why I went to see you, Mrs. Arini. Again, thank you very much. See you again. What happened to Michela made me realize something. Death can approach us at any moment. Don't say that, Rin. Sheila. Death is inevitable. People who have faith will embrace it. Do you have faith? Do you? If you want... Hello. Wait a minute. Nadia. Give me a chocolate, sweetheart. We'll give it to him, okay? -Arini? -Mei. -Aunt Mei. -Nadia. Mei. Oh, my God, Meirose! You... Do you live here? It's been three years. Oh, my God. Is this Akbar? Akbar, you're so grown up now! Nadia, this is your brother Akbar. Akbar, this is your sister, Nadia. Come on, shake hands. He must be confused. Do you remember her? Princess Sabrina. How does he know that, Mei? I always tell Akbar about Nadia's tale. He loves it. One kiss, please, one more. -Peace be with you. -Peace be with you. Come here. -Mrs. Arini. -Yes. I would like to introduce some members of the Indonesian Muslim Community in Europe. I'm Medina, chairman of the Indonesian Muslim Community in Bosnia. So glad you could visit, Mrs. Arini. The pleasure is entirely mine. I would love to hear about your experiences here. For your design, I want various small domes, like this mosque. -I need another day to make the revisions. -It's okay. We still have time. -Bud, please help to make the estimates. -Okay. Have you send the budget plan, Ran? Where is Amran? What do you want, my dear? Rice from Yogya. Satay Klathak? I'm not sure if the European food will suit your taste buds. I think I would like rice from Yogya or strange satay even less! Not strange satay, my dear. Satay Klathak. Har, what are you doing? What are you doing up there? Don't disturb me, I'm courting my love. On the neighbour's roof. Whatever. Honey. My darling. It is true what they say. If two people want to hang out, the third person will be the devil. -What did you say? -The devil! Now what? Not me. Peace be with you, Pras. Have you sent the budget plan? Budget plan? Not yet. -I'll just have to do it myself again? -Lazy. Work. Work. Work. After several months in Jakarta, I managed to email my father. I was surprised he was in Hungary. May I meet your father? Unfortunately, my father passed away. A year ago. Oh, I'm so sorry. So, now we are the same, Mei. My mother also passed away about two years ago. So, Mei, what do you do here now? I opened a boutique with the inheritance my father left me and I help out the European Indonesian Islamic Community here. How's Pras? He's good. Thank God, he's fine. All is well. In about two days, he will join us here. He will be so surprised to see you here. -Okay. -Here. This one's better. Okay. Smile! Akbar. One, two That's nice. Wait a minute. I want to check this out. Just a minute, sweetheart. Mom. I'm going over there, okay? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Sweetheart? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Oh, my God. Mom! Mom! You're so mean, Mom. Mom! Mom! Mom! Nadia! Good afternoon, Mrs. Arini. Sorry to disturb while you're resting. How do you feel? Better? Yes. Doctor, my daughter was right there. Where is she now? Perhaps with the nurse. I'll check. From the CT Scan It's cancer, isn't it? Two years ago, I had a surgery for cervical cancer. The doctor assured me that I was fully cured. From the metastasis, it appears to have already spread to the brain. Brain? Stage 4. But these are preliminary results. There are still several tests to be done. -To make sure that this... -How much time do I have? Two years? One year? Without treatment, it could be less. Therefore, I need to perform a biopsy procedure -to find out more. -No. Please, Doctor. I don't want to go through that. I don't want a biopsy done. I've already been through several types of treatments, Doctor. And I don't want go through that again. Please don't give up, Mrs. Arini, you need to continue fighting. Mom. I don't want to fight the will of God. You have a husband, a child. What about them, ma'am? Please don't let them know about my condition, Doctor. Mrs. Arini, at times like this, the support of your family is very important. But, by not knowing my condition, they will already be supporting me, Doctor. Please. Don't tell them, please. Please don't tell my daughter. Nadia should never know about my illness, please. All right. I'll contact the doctor who treated you, Mrs. Arini. -Good afternoon. -Afternoon. Mom. Nadia? How long have you been standing there? Here. Come to me. What is it, Nadia? I love you, Mom. I love you, too. Nadia... The doctor said I'm fine. I just need to rest. If I rest well and eat properly, I'll be fine. I promise never to be naughty again. Sometimes I don't listen to you. You are not naughty. Look at me. Here. You have never been naughty. You're an amazing child. You're smart. You are my Princess Sabrina. Please, don't be like this. Don't be sad, my beautiful girl. Okay? Are you looking at my mother's results, Uncle? Nadia. Come on in. Have you eaten? I have a sandwich, I made it myself. -It has tuna, beef... -Is my mom dying, Uncle? No, she's not dying. Who told you that? I heard it myself. The cancer has spread to the brain, right? Nadia. Nadia, wait. Nadia. Is there anything I can do for you? I promise I'll do anything you wish. Do you have a wife, Uncle? Not yet. But I have a special friend. What would you do if your special friend were dying? I would make her the happiest woman in the world. I would do whatever she wished. You know, Nadia? I very rarely buy ice cream for anyone. But if it's a special person, I'll buy it. Well, this is the first time I'm buying ice cream for someone. Your special friend, is she Hungarian? My special friend is beautiful like you. Nadia. Do you want to help me pick a special gift for my special friend? Yes. Uncle? This is cute for your friend. Why not the big one? You can only hug a big bear in your room. But you can take a little one everywhere. I have something for you, too. This necklace is for you. The other one is for me. I'll keep this half forever, Mom. Thank you, sweetheart. Here. Let Mom help Princess Sabrina put the necklace on. Peace be with you. Yes, Sheila. No, Sheila. I'm fine. The doctor said I was just too tired. So please pick me up, okay. Peace be with you. Why is the doll from Doctor Syarief so weak? What's wrong with the queen? Princess Sabrina is taking care of her mother who is sick. What's wrong with her mom? She has an illness that cannot be cured easily. So, Princess Sabrina must be sad? Yes. If it turns out that the queen can't be cured, what would happen then? Princess Sabrina will be sad and will miss her mother. Princess Sabrina should not be sad. Look at this. Princess Sabrina. Princess Sabrina, do you still remember the good fairy? There is a good fairy who will turn into the queen. And a mother for Princess Sabrina. Princess Sabrina and the good fairy will become a family. Together with the king. Are you happy? Do you know why there are four letters in LOVE? Each letter is like a pillar that supports the roof of a house. They are not crowded together, but close enough to support each other. That's the nature of love. Taking care each other, while giving each other space. Khalil Gibran, The Lover. You already quoted Pablo Neruda, Shakespeare and Khalil Gibran. Whose words will you use next to win me over? Naturally, my soul and your soul will connect in the sky. Our children will be born on the horizon. And we will look into each other's eyes for centuries. My Juwita, beautiful so naturally. My life is open for you. This moment wouldn't be complete without the poetry of Rendra. You're smart. If you're quoting W.S. Rendra, then I'm truly flattered. Will you marry me, Mei? Mei. I have thought this through. I'm serious. I want you to be with me. But you know I have a troubled past? Your past is yours alone. What I want from you is your future. But I have unfinished business. Give me time? Okay. I'll wait. Okay. You seriously want Meirose to get back together with Pras? I've heard the stories, I'm so glad -she's no longer a part of your life. -Sheila. Pras never divorced her. She's the only one who can take my place in Nadia and Pras' lives. Where are you going? Arini! Where is the key? Where are you going? Sheila, we never know how long we will live. I'm just preparing. You are Nadia's mother. Sheila, stop worrying. Don't be scared, okay?

When you're older, we'll go to Indonesia. Okay? -Arini? -Yes? You look a bit pale. I'm just tired, Mei. My schedule here has been packed. Doing interviews, meeting with publishers. Hey, let's go somewhere. Let's go eat. -Come on, Akbar. -All right. We'll have lunch. There's a nice restaurant near here. Akbar's favorite. Should we buy some groceries and cook at home?

I'll Skype you as soon as I have Wi-Fi. What is that? You're so cheap! Not wanting to spend money on your date! You're the same! Who went all the way to the roof yesterday looking for a signal? Nonsense! That's different. That's called making an effort. Since Sheila is not my girlfriend, yet. Who cares? You're so lame. Amran! Honey? Why do you smell so different? I just put some balm on. Oh, my God. No wonder you smell like a corpse. But you still wanted to hug me. Who are you? You're the one who hugged me. This is Panji. Not too close. Enough! We just got here and you're already making so much noise! Sheila, where are Arini and Nadia? Me and Panji, will take Amran and Hartono to the apartment, but you will go to Szentendre. Szentendre? Whose place is it? Go get the suitcases. Come on, Akbar. Call my dad "Daddy," not uncle. Come on. I don't want to! Akbar, please. Akbar. Call him "Daddy," not uncle, okay. Call him "Daddy." This is your dad. Call him Daddy, not uncle. Come on, Akbar. I don't want to! I don't want to! Akbar. Nadia? Nadia! Please stop, sweetheart! I want to talk to you. What's wrong, sweetheart? What is it? What happened to Akbar? Tell me. I want to make your wish come true. What wish, sweetheart? What wish? You want Aunt Mei to become my mother, right? Before you die. I'm sorry, Mom. I wasn't able to make your wish come true. You didn't do anything wrong. Nadia. Daddy. I missed you so much, Princess Sabrina. Has it been cold here? How are you, honey? I'm fine. Thank God.

There are more than 10,000 beautiful cities in this world. How did they happen to meet here in Budapest? It's fate, Har. Fate to commit polygamy again? I told you. Meirose loves Pras. Pras loves Meirose. Arini accepts it. So, what's wrong? I don't understand the way you think! There must be something wrong. She asked me to clear her schedule. What do you mean? When you were a baby, Daddy used to carry you. Yes. Where did we go on holiday, Nadia? Parangtritis Beach. Yes. Aunt Mei cooked today, Dad. And you helped me, right? You know, aside from running a boutique here, Mei is also a counselor for the Muslim Community. Right, Mei? -Oh, really? -Yes. She has converted three people. Is it true, Mei? I just shared my own learning experience. Knowledge that I gained from Arini and you when I was in trouble. Where are you staying exactly, Rin? Is it far from here? Yes. It's quite far, hon. About 30 minutes by train. Oh, not so far. Well then, after we finish dinner, let's go back to your place, okay? Why don't we spend the night here? I still wish to be with Akbar. Can we, Aunt Mei? Oh, my God! What are you doing? I just wanted to make a sandwich. You already ate, right? I'm hungry again. Okay. All right. It's okay, I'll do it. Won't be so good piled on like that.

I think this is the place. Meirose Corner. Yes. -Peace be with you. -Peace be with you. This is your boutique, Mei? -Akbar. -My goodness! -Mom. -Yes, sweetheart? The arrangement is nice, Mei. What's wrong, Mei? I have to go. I have to deliver some orders and I forgot. But, wait, wait. You're bringing so many things alone? I'm used to this. Please go with Mei, honey. Give her a ride, hon. You see that? How can Mei go alone with so many things? Please help her. Please, honey? And you can sightsee at the same time. Nadia, please go with Dad. -You can watch Akbar, too. -Okay. Are you coming with us, Rin? Me? It's very cold outside, hon. I think I'm just going to rest, okay. You all please go. Do some sightseeing. You haven't had a chance to do that yet, right?

It's not an issue. Thank you. Hi, Akbar. I have a fairy tale book for you. I will ask your mom to pass it on to you. Thank you. I'm glad to see that you are appreciated here. Yes. Sometimes it's difficult to live in a non-Muslim country. Especially after the Syria incidents. Many immigrants came to Europe and they're considered a burden to the country. How did you survive? I never stopped thinking about you and Akbar. Oh, really? I thought you forgot about us. You just said you are always positive. Arini and I tried to find many ways to contact you. And Nadia always asked about Akbar. I didn't want to be found. I didn't want to bother you. And I didn't want you to feel the need to always be fair. Have you found a new dad for Akbar? Akbar! Akbar! Dad! Aunt Mei! Akbar can't breathe. -Can't breathe? -Did he eat chocolate? No, just this. That's white chocolate, Nadia. It's got nuts in it. He's allergic. We need to see a doctor. Akbar is the only one I have, Pras. I don't want to lose him. Just pray, Mei. Just pray. Where are my toiletries? I can't find them. Did the maid forget to pack them? It's there. I prepared everything. I put them all in one bag. There you go. There's your shampoo, soap, and face wash, too. You hate it when you don't wash your face all day, right? Only you can do all this for me. I don't know what I would do without you. Don't say that. I've written everything in a book. So, you don't need to depend on me. No. I like depending on you. Who else would I depend on? Only you. -Enough. Go take a shower. -Yes. Oh, my God! LETTER OF DIVORCE The surgery went well, Mei. Thank you for giving me your strength. I miss you. -Honey? -Yes. Just a second. What is it, hon? Actually, I wanted to discuss this last night. What is this? It looks like it was fated for us to meet Meirose here. LETTER OF DIVORCE So that I can settle everything soon. What do you mean? Honey, this is... -Why did you write this letter? -Honey. I'm going to divorce Meirose. She has a good life here. I've seen it for myself. And it would be unfair for me to continue tying her down. Now, there's only me, you and Nadia. Dark clouds are rolling in Bearing such sad news What can I do for my love? Can I become the sky That protects you So that sadness Mei, why don't you come with us? We have a car, Panji will pick us up, right, hon? I still have some errands. I need to go to the Dar As-Salam mosque after this. -Okay. -You guys go ahead. Bye, sweetheart. Give me a kiss. You be careful. -Bye, Aunt Mei. -Bye. -Bye. -Peace be with you, Mei. -Arini. -Hartono. Why are you here alone? Where is Panji? He's got something to do. So, I'll drive. You'll drive? -Yes, GPS. -Oh. -Come on. -Where is Sheila? It's complicated. Some sort of incident with a tulip. What do you mean? Yes? Oh, wow. It means Sheila is going to accept Amran? Wait. The story isn't finished yet. This is what happened... You sure take your time to dress up. I'm going to meet the woman I love, I need to look handsome, Hartono. Even abroad you look so strange. Whatever! The important thing is that I'm going to meet Sheila. I have to look good. Really good. This is it. That corpse again. Amran. Hartono. I'm going to take you guys to dinner with Pras and Arini, okay? -Great. -Please. -Come. Hurry. -Whatever. I don't care. -Har. -What is it? Honey, why do you smell different again? This time you smell of some kind of spice. Yes. I'm using a chili based ointment. Oh, my God! You again? You were already in the car. I was just about to open the door when you hugged me again. No one wants to hug you. -I didn't want to be hugged either. -Panji. Thank you for the real tulip. -Tulip? -Tulip? How did you know? What do you mean? Oh, yes. The tulip in front of your room... I prepared it as promised. Oh, my God. More tulips. -What happened to him? -It's nothing. His stomach acts up in the cold. Can he use the chili ointment? Poor Amran. It's his own fault. He wants to date all the girls. Gita, Rita, Sheila. Oh, man! -Forget it. Let's go. -Come on. What is it, sweetheart? You're sad? You're missing Akbar? We will see him again, okay? He doesn't want to divorce you? I have not asked. But the strange thing is, his wife does not want me to divorce him. -Wow. -Yes. That kind of woman can only be found in fairy tales. No, I mean, I have a female patient. She has a serious illness. But she chooses to hide from her daughter and husband. So, strong women exist. Arini. -George. -Arini. Hi. Hello. -I need to go to the rest room. -Okay. Arini? Arini! Sorry, I'll call you back. Why didn't you tell me, Arini? I didn't want you to worry, my love. I'll do anything to help you get better. Enough. Enough, honey. I don't want us to suffer. No. No, honey. We can still try. Enough. Pras. How did I not know my own wife was ill? Don't blame yourself. We are trying our best to cure Arini. Is there a mosque near here, Doc? Yes. Dar As-salam Mosque. Not far from here. Can I take you there? No, it's okay. Just give me the directions. I would be happy to walk with you. I... For as long as I've been a doctor, I have never met a patient as strong as Arini. She is a great woman. You're very lucky to have her as your wife. Thank you, Doctor. Are you married, Doctor? Not yet. Still in the process. She... Hasn't resolved her past. Well, I can only wait. Before I got married, Arini's father said to me... You give me your word? That you'll never hurt my child, my Arini? I promise to take good care of her. To be a responsible man. And to love Arini completely, sir. I have failed to keep my promise, Doc. Oh, God. Oh, God. Sorry, Doc. It's okay. I... -I need to be alone. -Okay. I would like to deliver A last message to you Before I close this love story of ours If I were just a word Together we are a sentence That tells the tale Of the course of our love You are used to the way I am And used to having me around -Peace be with you. -Can I have your number, please? But don't let this life end In case I have to go Do you believe he could be a good husband for you? Who can guarantee how a person will turn out to be, Dad? We have to simply believe. And you believe in him? With your blessing. In your memories Pras? -Mei? -Pras. My mind is all over the place, Mei. I... There is something I wanted to tell you. That... That's okay. Akbar's nanny. Wait a minute. Some hot water accidentally spilled on Akbar. I have already bandaged his wounds. He is feeling better now. -What? -Akbar. Some hot water spilled on him. The nanny is a little careless sometimes. I have to go home. -Okay. -I'm sorry. -It's okay. -I really have to go. Yes, it's okay. There's a very good center for cancer treatment in Holland. My friend can help. Let's take Arini there. No point, Har. Arini doesn't want to. Why don’t you bring her home to Yogya, Pras? I'm not sure why but Arini still wants to be here. -She still has work or something? -I don't know! The only thing I can do now is to make her happy. Marriage is the union of souls. And Islam brings these souls together. As a sacred bond to balance and protect one another. But my marriage was built on someone's pain. I don't wish to continue hurting someone else. You see, Meirose, before you make a decision, it's better to pray first. Because Islam will provide a way out of every problem. Thank you. I've decided. My time is completely for you and Nadia. I realize that I haven't spent enough time with you. I've been too busy with work. You always take care of me. Take care of Nadia. What do you want, Rin? Honey?
