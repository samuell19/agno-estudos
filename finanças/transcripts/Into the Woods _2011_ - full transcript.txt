I've had enough of you... Get out of my sight! I hate you! Once upon a time... - I wish... - ... in a far-off kingdom,... - ... more than anything, more than life,... - ... lived a young maiden, a sad... - ... more than jewels... - I wish... - ... young lad, and a childless baker... - ... more than life, more than anything,... - I wish... - ... with his wife. - ... more than the moon... - I wish... - The King is giving a festival! - ... more than life,... - I wish... - I wish to go to the festival! - ... more than riches,... - And the ball! - I wish my cow would give us some milk. - ... more than anything,... - I wish we had a child. - Please, pal, squeeze, pal. - I want a child. - I wish to go to the festival. - I wish you'd give us some... - ... milk or even cheese. - I wish we might have a child. - I wish... - You wish to go to the festival? - The poor girl's mother had died. - You, Cinderella, the festival? - What, you, Cinderella, the festival? - What, you wish to go to the festival? The festival?! The King's festival?! - And her father had taken for his new wife—rargh!— - The festival?! - ... a woman with two daughters of her own. - Look at your nails! - Look at your dress! - People will laugh at you— - Nevertheless— - You still wish to go to the festival, and dance before the Prince?! All three were beautiful of face, but vile and black of heart. Jack, on the other hand, had no father, and his mother... - I wish... - Well, she was not quite beautiful. I wish my son were not a fool. I wish my house was not a mess. I wish the cow was full of milk, I wish the walls were full of gold— I wish a lot of things. Why come in, little girl. - I wish... It's not for me, it's for my Granny in the woods. A loaf of bread, please, to bring my poor old hungry Granny in the woods. Just a loaf of bread, please. Cinderella's stepmother had a surprise for her. I have emptied a pot of lentils into the ashes for you. If you have picked them out again in two hours' time, you shall go to the ball with us. And perhaps a sticky bun? Or four? Birds in the sky, birds in the eaves, in the leaves, in the fields, in the castles and ponds— - And a few of those pies,... - Come, little birds, - ... please! - ... down from the eaves and the leaves, over fields, out of castles and ponds! No, squeeze pal. Quick, little birds, flick through the ashes. Pick and peck, but swiftly, sift through the ashes, into the pot! Listen well, son. Milky-White must be taken to market. But Mother, no! He's the best cow— Was. Was! She's been dry for a week. We've no food nor money and no choice but to sell her while she can still command a price. But Milky-White is my best friend in the whole world! Look at her! There are bugs on her dugs. There are flies in her eyes. There's a lump on her rump big enough to be a hump! - But— - Son, we've no time to sit and dither, while her withers wither with her. And no one keeps a cow for a friend! Sometimes, I fear you're touched. Into the woods, it's time to go, I hate to leave, I have to, though. Into the woods, it's time, and so I must begin my journey. Into the woods and through the trees, to where I am expected, Ma'am. Into the woods, to Grandmother's house. Into the woods, to Grandmother's house. - You're certain of your way? - The way is clear, the light is good, I have no fear, nor no one should. The woods are just trees, the trees are just wood. I sort of hate to ask it, but do you have a basket? - Don't stray and be late. - And save some of those sweets for Granny. Into the woods and down the dell, the path is straight, I know it well. Into the woods, and who can tell what's waiting on my journey? Into the woods to bring some bread to Granny who is sick in bed. Never can tell what lies ahead. For all that I know, she's already dead. Into the woods, into the woods, Into the woods, to Grandmother's house, and home before dark. Fly, birds, back to the sky, back to the eaves and the leaves, and the fields and the castles— - Hurry up and do my hair, Cinderella. Are you really wearing that? - Here, I found a little tear, Cinderella, Can't you hide it with a hat? - You look beautiful. - I know. - She means me. - Put it in a twist. - Who will be here? - Mother said be good, Father said be nice, That was always their advice. So be nice, Cinderella, good, Cinderella, nice good good nice— - Aghh! Clod. Because the Baker had lost his mother and father in a baking accident, —well, at least that was what he believed— he was eager to have a family of his own, and was concerned that all efforts until now had failed. - Who might that be? - We have sold our last loaf of bread. It's the witch from next door! We have no bread! - Of course you have no bread. - What do you wish? It's not what I wish, it's what you wish! Nothing cooking in there now, is there? The old enchantress went on to tell the couple that she had placed a spell on their house. What spell? In the past, when you were no more than a babe, your father brought his young wife and you to this cottage. They were a handsome couple. But not handsome neighbors! You see, your mother was with child, and she had developed an unusual appetite. She took one look at my beautiful garden and told your father that what she wanted more than anything in the world was greens, greens, and nothing but greens: parsley, pepper, cabbages, and celery, asparagus and watercress and fiddleferns and lettuce! He said, "All right," but it wasn't quite, 'cause I caught him in the autumn in my garden one night! He was robbing me, raping me, rooting through my rutabaga, raiding my arugula, and ripping up the rampion—my champion, my favorite! I should have laid a spell on him right there! Could have turned him into stone, or a dog, or a chair, or a ssss— ssss— ssss— But I let him have the rampion, I'd lots to spare. In return, however, I said, "Fair is fair: You can let me have the baby that your wife will bear. And we'll call it square." - I had a brother! No! But you had a sister. But the witch refused to tell him any more of his sister. Not even that her name was Rapunzel. Now, I thought I had been more than reasonable, and that we all might live happily ever after. But how was I to know what your father had also hidden in his pocket? You see, when I inherited that garden, my mother had warned me that I would be punished if I ever were to lose any of the beans. - Beans? - The special beans. I let him go, I didn't know he'd stolen my beans! I was watching him crawl back over the wall, and then bang, crash, and the lightning flashed! And—well that's another story, never mind. Anyway, at last the big day came, and I made my claim. "Oh, don't take away the baby," they shrieked and screeched. But I did, and I hid her where she'll never be reached. And your father cried, and your mother died, when for extra measure—I admit it was a pleasure— I said, "Sorry, but I'm still not mollified." And I laid a little spell on them— you too, son— that your family tree would always be a barren one. So, there's no more fuss, and there's no more scenes, and my garden thrives—you should see my nectarines! But I'm telling you the same I tell kings and queens: Don't ever never ever mess around with my greens! Especially the beans! Now listen to me, Jack. Lead Milky-White to market, and fetch the best price you can. Take no less than five pounds. Are you listening to me? - Yeah. - Now, how much are you to ask? - No more than five— Less than five! Jack, Jack, Jack, head in a sack, the house is getting colder. This is not a time for dreaming. Chimney-stack starting to crack, the mice are getting bolder, the floor's gone slack, your mother's getting older, your father's not back, and you can't just sit here dreaming pretty dreams. To wish and wait from day to day will never keep the wolves away. So, into the woods, the time is now, we have to live, I don't care how. Into the woods to sell the cow, you must begin the journey. Straight through the woods and don't delay— we have to face the marketplace. Into the woods to journey's end! Into the woods to sell a friend... Someday, you'll have a real pet, Jack. A piggy? Meanwhile, the witch, for purposes of her own, explained how the Baker might lift the spell. - You wish to have the curse reversed? - Yes. - I'll need a certain potion first. Go to the wood and bring me back: One: the cow as white as milk, Two: the cape as red as blood, Three: the hair as yellow as corn, Four: the slipper as pure as gold. Bring me these before the chime of midnight in three days' time, and you shall have, I guarantee, a child as perfect as child can be. Go to the wood! Ladies, our carriage waits. - Now may I go to the festival? - The festival? Darling, those nails! Darling, those clothes! Lentils are one thing, but darling, with those, you'll make us the fools of the festival and mortify the Prince! The carriage is waiting. We must be gone. I wish... Look what I found in Father's hunting jacket. - Six beans. - I wonder if they're the— - The witch's beans? We'll take them with us. - No! - You are not coming. - But I know you are fearful of the woods at night. The spell is on my house. Only I can lift the spell— - ... the spell is on my house! - No, no, the spell is on our house! - No. - We must lift the spell together, the spell is on our house— You are not to come, and that is final! - Now, what am I to return with? - You don't remember? - I still wish to go to the festival. - The cow as white as milk,... - But how am I ever to get to the festival? - ... the cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow... - I know, I'll visit Mother's grave,... - ... as corn... What?! - ... the grave at the hazel tree, and... - The slipper! - The slipper as pure as... - ... tell her I just want to go to the King's festival. - ... gold! The cow, the cape, the slipper as pure as gold! - The hair! - Into the woods, it's time to go, it may be all in vain, you/I know. Into the woods—but even so, I have to take the journey. Into the woods, the path is straight, I know it well, but who can tell? Into the woods to lift the spell— Into the woods to visit Mother— - Into the woods to fetch the things— - To make the potion— To go to the festival— Into the woods without regret, the choice is made, the task is set. Into the woods, but not forgetting why I'm on the journey. Into the woods to get my wish, I don't care how, the time is now. - Into the woods to sell the cow— - Into the woods to get the money— - Into the woods to lift the spell— - To make the potion— - To go to the festival— - Into the woods to Grandmother's house! Into the woods to Grandmother's house! The way is clear, the light is good, I have no fear, nor no one should. The woods are just trees, the trees are just wood. No need to be afraid there— - There's something in the glade, there. Into the woods without delay, but careful not to lose the way. Into the woods, who knows what may be lurking on the journey? Into the woods to get the thing that makes it worth the journeying. Into the woods— - To see the King! - To sell the cow! - To make the potion! - To see, to sell, to get, to bring, To make, to lift, to go to the festival! Into the woods! Into the woods! Into the woods, then out of the woods, and home before dark! Cinderella had planted a branch at the grave of her mother. She visited there so often, and wept so much, that her tears watered it until it had become a handsome tree. I've been good, and I've been kind, Mother, doing only what I learned from you. Why then am I left behind, Mother, is there something more that I should do? What is wrong with me, Mother? Something must be wrong. I wish— What, child? Specify. Opportunity is not a lengthy visitor, and good fortune, like bad, can befall when least expected. Do you know what you wish? Are you certain what you wish is what you want? If you know what you want, then make a wish. Ask the tree, and you shall have your wish! Shiver and quiver, little tree, silver and gold throw down on me. I'm off to get my wish. Quiet. Silence everywhere, Milky-White. Not to my liking. Hello, Jack. - How did you know my name? - When first I appear, I seem mysterious. But when explained, I'm nothing serious. - Say that again? - On your way to market? You might have been there long ago. Taking your time, Jack? - No, sir. - Is that the truth? - Well, you see now I'm resting. - How much are you asking for the animal? No less than five pounds, sir. - Jack. Why such a sum? - My mother told me— Your mother? A boy your age? Why, you'd be lucky to exchange her... for a sack of beans. - Well, I— Come along, Milky-White. There are spirits here. Boo! Good day, young lady. Good day, Mr. Wolf. - Whither away so hurriedly? - To my grandmother's. And what might be in your basket? Er, bread and wine, so Granny'll have something good to keep her strong. And where might your grandmother live? A good quarter of a league further in the woods. Her house stands under three large oak trees. Look at that flesh, pink and plump. Hello little girl... Tender and fresh, not one lump. Hello little girl... - Stop it! This one's especially lush, delicious... Hello little girl, what's your rush? You're missing all the flowers. The sun won't set for hours, Take your time. - Mother said, "Straight ahead," not to delay or be misled— But slow, little girl, hark and hush, the birds are singing sweetly. You'll miss the birds completely, you're traveling so fleetly. Grandmother first, then Miss Plump, what a delectable couple: utter perfection—one brittle, one supple— one moment, my dear! - Mother said, "Come what may,... - ... follow the path and never stray." - Just so, little girl, any path—so many worth exploring. Just one would be so boring. And look what you're ignoring... Think of those crisp, aging bones, then something fresh on the palate. Think of that scrumptious carnality twice in one day! There's no possible way to describe what you feel, when you're talking to your meal! Mother said not to stray. Still, I suppose a small delay... Granny might like a fresh bouquet. Goodbye, Mr. Wolf. Goodbye, little girl. And hello... Is harm to come to that little girl... in the red cape? - Forget the little girl and get the cape! - You frightened me. That's the cape! Get it! Get it! Get it! - Well, er, how am I supposed to get it? - Ugh. You go up to the little thing, and you take it! I can't just take a cloak from a little girl! Why don't you take it? - Oh, if I could, I would! But I mustn't touch— My Rapunzel! Listen to her beautiful music! Get me what I need! Get me what I need! Oh, this is ridiculous. I'll never get that red cape, nor find a golden cow, or a yellow slipper— Or was it a golden slipper and a yellow cow? Oh no... - The cow as white as milk, the cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn— - What are you doing here? - You forgot your scarf. You have no business being alone in the wood. You would not believe what I have come upon here. You would be frightened for your life. Now, go home immediately! - I wish to help. - No! The spell is on my house— - Our house. - Only I can lift the spell. - We must lift... - ... the spell together, the spell is on— - The spell is on my house. The spell is on— A cow as white as... ... milk. - Hello there, young man. - Hello, sir. What might you be doing with a cow in the middle of the forest? I was heading toward market, but I seem to have lost my way. - And what are you planning to do there? - And what are you planning to do there? Sell ​​my cow, sir. No less than five pounds. - Five pounds! Where am I to get five pounds? She must be generous of milk to fetch five pounds. Yes, ma'am. And if you can't fetch that sum, then what are you to do? I hadn't thought of that. Well, I suppose my mother and I will have no food to eat. - This is the total sum. - Beans! Oh... Oh... We mustn't give up our beans. Well, if you feel we must. Huh? Beans will bring you food, son. Beans in exchange for my cow? Oh, these are no ordinary beans, son. These beans carry magic! - Magic? - Hmm. What kind of magic? Tell him... - Magic... that defies description. - My mother would not be happy— Why you'd be lucky to exchange her for a sack of beans! - How many beans? - Er, six— Five. Five. We can't part with all of them. We must leave one for ourselves. Besides, I'd say those beans are worth... ooh, a pound each, at the very least. - Could I buy my cow back someday? - Well... - Well... Possibly. Well, good luck, young man. I guess this is goodbye, old pal, you've been a perfect friend. I hate to see us part, old pal, someday I'll buy you back. I'll see you soon again. I hope that when I do, it won't be on a plate. Take the cow and go home. - I was trying to be helpful. - Magic beans! We have no reason to believe that they are magic. Are we to dispel this curse through deceit? No one would have given him more for that creature. We did him a favor. At least they'll have some food. Five beans! If you know what you want, then you go, and you find it and you get it. - Home. - Do we want a child or not? And you give and you take, and you bid and you bargain, or you live to regret it. - Will you please go home? - There are rights and wrongs and in-betweens—no one waits when fortune intervenes! And maybe they're really magic. Who knows? Why you do what you do: that's the point. All the rest of it is chatter. - Look at her, she's crying. - If the thing you do is pure in intent, if it's meant, and it's just a little bent, does it matter? - Yes. No, what matters is that everyone tells tiny lies. What's important, really, is the size. - What?! - Only three more tries, and we'll have our prize. When the end's in sight, you'll realize: If the end is right, it justifies the beans! Take the cow and go home. I will carry this out in my own fashion. As for Rapunzel, the witch was careful not to lose this beauty to the outside world, and so shut her within a doorless tower that lay deep within the forest. Children are a blessing, if you know where they are. Nothing so distressing, though, as when they keep you guessing, so be sure you don't leave any doors ajar. Make a little world! - Our little world... - Our little world... ... is big enough for me. - Perfect! - Our little world... - Our little world... ... is all it needs to be. - Perfect! - Brushing my hair, combing my hair,... ... only my mother and me, and my hair. - Our little world is perfect. - Our little world is perfect. If she just didn't drool... Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair to me! Rap-Rapunzel! Look at that complexion, still untouched by the sun! Children need protection, just the way they need affection, or they wander, and they wander, and they run from your little world. - Our little world... - Our little world... ... is all I have to see. - Perfect! - Perfect! - Our little world... - Our little world... ... is everything a world ought to be. - Perfect, perfect... - Washing my hair... - Tending her hair... - Drying my hair, unraveling my hair,... - Stroking her hair, looking at her... - ... winding, and minding, and binding my— - ... hair... Something we can share: hair! What do I care what they're doing out there? If what was growing was only her hair, and not her, that I'd prefer. Nevertheless... - Our little world... - Our little world is... - Our little world is... ... delicious,... Rapunzel. Rapunzel, what a strange name. - ... fulfilling,... - Strange, yet beautiful—and fit for a prince! - ... exclusive, unchanging, exemplary,... Tomorrow, before that horrible witch arrives, I will stand before her window, and ask her to let her hair down to me. - Hello there, little one. - Hello. Er, did you save some of those sweets for Granny? I ate all the sweets, and half the loaf of bread. Tell me, um, where did you get that beautiful cape? I so admire it. - My Granny made it for me. - Is that right? I would love a red cloak like that. You'd look pretty foolish. - Er, may I take a look at it? - I don't like to be without my cape, so— Please give it back. - I want it badly! - Give it back, please! - Forget the little girl and get the cape! Give it to me, it's mine! You'll look like an idiot! I just wanted to make certain that you really loved that cape. Now, er... You run along to Granny—and be careful no wolf comes your way. I'd rather a wolf than you, any day! If you know what you need, then you go, and you find it, and then you take it. Do I want a child or not? It's a cloak. What's a cloak? It's a joke, it's a stupid little cloak. And a cloak is what you make it. So you take it. Things are only what you need them for, What's important is who needs them more. And so, the Baker, with newfound determination, went after the red cape. As for the little girl, she was surprised to find her grandmother's cottage door standing open. Oh, dear. How uneasy I feel. Perhaps it's all the sweets. Good day, Grandmother. My, Grandmother, you're looking very strange. What big ears you have! All the better to hear you with, my dear. But, Grandmother, what big eyes you have! All the better to see you with, my dear. But, Grandmother, what large hands you have! All the better to hug you with, my dear. Oh, Grandmother. What a terrible, big wet mouth you have! All the better to eat you with! Then with a single bound, he was devouring the little girl. Well... it was a full day of eating for both. And with his appetite appeased, the wolf took to bed for a nice, long nap. That grandmother has a mighty snore. Odd. Where's the little one? Eating, no doubt. Or eaten! Grandmother, ha! Red cloth... a piece of the... I'll get that cape, from within-side your stomach. Oh, what a fright! How dark and dank it was inside that wolf! Kill the devil! Take that knife and cut his evil head off. Let's see the demon sliced into a thousand bits! Better yet, let the animal die a painful, agonizing, hideous death! - Granny! - Quiet, child. This evil must be destroyed! Well, I'll leave you to your task. - Don't you want the skins? - No! No, you can keep them. - What kind of a hunter are you? - I'm a baker! - Come along. Mother said, "Straight ahead," not to delay or be misled. I should have heeded her advice, but he seemed so nice. And he showed me things, many beautiful things that I hadn't thought to explore. They were off my path, so I never had dared. I had been so careful, I never had cared. And he made me feel excited—well, excited and scared. When he said, "Come in!" with that sickening grin, how could I know what was in store? Once his teeth were bared, though, I really got scared— well, excited and scared— but he drew me close and he swallowed me down, down a dark slimy path, where lie secrets that I never want to know, and when everything familiar seemed to disappear forever, at the end of the path was Granny once again. So we wait in the dark until someone sets us free! And we're brought into the light, and we're back at the start. And I know things now, many valuable things that I hadn't known before. Do not put your faith in a cape and a hood. They will not protect you the way that they should. And take extra care with strangers, even flowers have their dangers. And though scary is exciting, nice is different than good. Now I know: don't be scared. Granny is right, just be prepared. Isn't it nice to know a lot! And a little bit not. Yes! Ha-ha. Mr. Baker, you saved our lives. Here. - Are you certain? - Yes. Maybe Granny will make me another with the skins of that wolf! Thank you! And so the Baker, with the second article in hand, feeling braver and more satisfied than he had ever felt, ran back through the woods. As for the lad Jack... Only a dolt would exchange a cow for beans! - Mother, no! - To bed without supper for you! Little did they know, those beans would grow into an enormous stalk that would stretch into the heavens. Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair to me. - Look! - Are you all right, Miss? Yes, I just need to catch my breath. What a beautiful gown you're wearing! Were you at the King's festival? - Yes. Oh, aren't you the lucky one? Whyever are you alone in the woods at this hour? Have you seen a beautiful young woman in a ball gown pass through? - I don't think so, sir. - I think I see her over there, sir! I've never lied to royalty before. I've never anything to royalty before. - Thank you! - If a prince were looking for me, I certainly wouldn't hide. Well, what brings you here? And with a cow! Oh, my husband's somewhere in the woods. He's undoing a spell. - Ooh! - Oh yes! So, the Prince... What was he like? He's a very nice prince. - And? - And... it's a very nice ball. - And? - And... when I entered, they trumpeted. - And the Prince? - Oh, the Prince. - Yes, the Prince - Well, he's tall. Is that all? Did you dance? Is he charming? They say that he's charming. We did nothing but dance. - Yes. And? - And it made a nice change. - No, the Prince. - Oh, the Prince. - Yes, the Prince. He has charm for a prince, I guess. - Guess? I don't meet a wide range. And it's all very strange. Are you to return the festival tomorrow eve? I don't know. Perhaps? - Perhaps?! Oh, to be pursued by a prince! All that pursues me is tomorrow's bread. What I wouldn't give to be in your shoes... Oh, will you look over there? An enormous vine growing next to that little cottage! ... I mean slippers,... It looks like a giant beanstalk rising into the sky— ... as pure as gold! - I must get home! - No, wait, wait, I need your shoes, wait! Hey! Come back here! One midnight gone... No knot unties itself. Sometimes the things you most wish for are not to be touched. The harder to get, the better to have. - Agreed? - Agreed. - Never wear mauve at a ball. - Or pink. Or open your mouth. The difference between a cow and a bean: a bean can begin an adventure. Slotted spoons don't hold much soup. The prettier the flower, the farther from the path. One midnight gone... The mouth of a wolf's not the end of the world. A servant is not just a dog, to a Prince. Opportunity is not a lengthy visitor. You may know what you need, but to get what you want, better see that you keep what you have. - One midnight gone... - Sometimes the things you most wish for are not to be touched... - The harder to get, the better to have... One midnight gone! One midnight gone! Into the woods. Into the woods. Into the woods, then out of the woods, and home before— There are giants in the sky. There are big tall terrible giants in the sky! When you're way up high, and you look below at the world you've left, and the things you know, little more than a glance is enough to show you just how small you are. When you're way up high, and you're on your own, in a world like none that you've ever known, where the sky is lead, and the earth is stone, you're free to do whatever pleases you, exploring things you'd never dare 'cause you don't care, when suddenly there's a big tall terrible giant at the door! A big tall terrible lady giant sweeping the floor. And she gives you food, and she gives you rest, and she draws you close to her giant breast, and you know things now that you never knew before, not till the sky. Only just when you've made a friend and all, and you know she's big, but you don't feel small, someone bigger than her comes along the hall to swallow you for lunch. And your heart is lead, and your stomach stone, and you're really scared being all alone. And it's then that you long for the things you've known, and the world you've left, and the little you own. The fun is done. You steal what you can and run. And you scramble down, and you look below, and the world you know begins to grow: The roof, the house and your mother at the door... The roof, the house and the world you never thought to explore... And you think of all of the things you've seen, and you wish that you could live in between, and you're back again, only different than before, after the sky. There are giants in the sky! There are big tall terrible awesome scary wonderful giants in the sky! Good fortune! Good fortune! Sir! Sir! Look what I have! Here's five gold pieces. - Five gold pieces... - Where is Milky-White? - Milky-White? Oh, she's at home, with my wife. - Let's go find them. No, wait! Er, I-I don't know that I wish to sell. - But you said that I might buy her back. - I know, but er, I'm not certain that five gold pieces— - Are you saying that you wish for more money? - Well, more money is always— - Keep this. I will go fetch more. No, no, no, wait! I didn't mean... Five gold pieces. Why, with this money, I could buy baking supplies for a year. I could buy a new thatched roof, and a new chimney— - But could you buy yourself a child? Who are you? When first I appear, I seem delirious. But when explained, I'm nothing serious. Could you buy yourself a child? - I don't understand— - How badly do you wish a child? Five gold pieces? - Ten? Twenty? - I hadn't thought to put a price on it— Exactly. You haven't thought about many things, have you, son? Give me back the money. It's not yours! Nor is it Jack's. The money's not what's important. What's important is that your wish be honored. Come back! Damn. Give me back the—ugh... What are you doing here now? I see you've the red cape. Yes, I've the cape! Only two items left to locate. - Three. - Two. I've the cape and the cow. - You've the cape! Where's the cow? She ran away. I've been looking for her all night—I've never reached home. I should have known better than to have entrusted her to you. She might just as easily have run from you. - Yeah, but she didn't. - But she might have. - But she didn't! Who cares?! The cow is gone! Get it back! Get it back! We were just about to do that. I can give you this! - Don't give me that, fool! I don't want to touch that! Have you no sense?! Deliver the items before the last stroke of midnight. Or you'll wish you never thought to have a child! I don't like that woman. - I'm sorry I lost the cow. I shouldn't have yelled. Now will you please, go back to the village? I will make things right. And then we can just go about our life. No more hunting about in the woods for strange objects. No more witches, or dim-witted boys, and hungry little girls. Go! Ah, good brother, there you are. Father and I had wondered where you'd gone. I've been looking all night... for her. - Her? The beautiful one I danced the evening with. - Where did she go? - Ugh, disappeared, like the fine morning mist. - She was lovely. - Er, the loveliest. I'm not so certain of that. I must confess, I too have found a lovely maiden. She lives here, in the woods. - The woods? - Yes, at the top of a tall tower, that has no door or stairs. - Where? Two leagues from here, due east just beyond the mossy knoll. And, erm, how do you manage a visit? - Well, I stand beneath her tower,... - Yes? - ... and I say,... - Mm-hmm? ... "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair to me." And she lets down the longest, most beautiful head of hair—yellow as corn—which I climb to her. - Rapunzel? - Mm-hmm. Rapunzel! What kind of a name is that? You jest! I have never heard of such a thing— I speak the truth! She's as true as your maiden. A maiden running from a prince? None would run from us. Yet one has. Did I abuse her, or show her disdain? Why does she run from me? If I should lose her, how shall I regain the heart she has won from me? Agony! Beyond power of speech. When the one thing you want is the only thing out of your reach. High in her tower, she sits by the hour, maintaining her hair. Blithe and becoming, and frequently humming a lighthearted air: Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah— Agony! Far more painful than yours, when you know she would go with you, if there only were doors. Agony! Oh, the torture they teach! - What's as intriguing... - Or half so fatiguing... as what's out of reach? Am I not sensitive, clever, well-mannered, considerate, passionate, charming, as kind as I'm handsome, and heir to a throne? You are everything maidens could wish for! - Then why no... - Do I know? The girl must be mad! You know nothing of madness till you're climbing her hair, and you see her up there as you're nearing her, all the while hearing her— Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah— - Agony! - Misery! - Woe! Though it's different for each. - Always ten steps behind... - Always ten feet below... and she's just out of reach. Agony that can cut like a knife! I must have her to wife. Two princes, each more handsome than the other. No! Get the hair. Get the hair. Excuse me, young woman! Have you encountered a boy with carrot-topped hair, and a sunny, though occasionally vague disposition, answering to the name of Jack? - Not the one partial to a white cow? - He's the one. - Have you seen the cow? - No, and I don't care to ever again. Children can be very queer about their animals. You be careful with your children. I have no children. That's okay, too. Yes... well, I've not seen your son today. I hope he didn't go up that beanstalk again. Quit while you're ahead, I say. Jack! Jack! Moo. Moo. Moo Looking for your cow? Where did you find her? Hello! What are you doing? I'm here to make amends. I want you to stay out of this, old man! I'm here to see your wish is granted. You've caused enough trouble! Keep out of my path. Well, I hope there are no witches to encounter. Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair to me. Is that you, my prince? Yes. Excuse me for this. - Oh no! Sorry! You do take plenty of spills, don't you? Hello! It's these slippers. They're not suited for these surroundings. Actually, they're not much suited for dancing either. I'd say those slippers were as pure as gold. Yes, they're all you could wish for in beauty. What I wouldn't give for just one. One isn't likely to do you much good. So, was the ball just as wonderful as last evening? - Oh, it's still a nice ball. - Yes? And? And... they have far too much food. No, the Prince... - Oh, the Prince? - Yes, the Prince. - If he knew who I really was... - Oh? Who? - I'm afraid I was rude. - Oh? How? - Now I'm being pursued. - Yes? And? - And I'm not in the mood. He must really have taken a liking to you. I have no experience with princes, and castles and gowns— Oh, nonsense. Every girl dreams of that wonderful— - Look, sir. Look! - Yes, there she is! - I must go! - But I... must have your shoe! - Ow! - Stop that! - I need it! I need it! I need it get out of here! Where did she go? - Who, sir? - Don't play the fool, woman. Oh! Oh, you mean the beautiful young maiden in the ball gown? She went in that direction. I was trying to hold her here for you. I can capture my own damsel, thank you. Yes, sir. Where did he go? - Who? - The Prince, of course! - Yes! - Oh, he went in that direction, but you'll never reach him— - Yes— - Well, yes, we would have, if that mongrel with the cow hadn't molested us. - Cow?! Please, let me just compare this color with that of your own! He wants to compare our hair to corn! He's over there! I thought you were returning home. I've had no luck. - You've the cow! Yes, I've the cow. I've only two of the four. - Three. -Two. - Three. Compare this to your corn. - Where did you find that? - Oh, I pulled it from a maiden in a tower. - Three! - And I almost had the fourth, but she got away. Well, we've an entire day left. Surely we can locate the slipper by then. We? You mean you'll allow me to stay? Well, perhaps it will take the two of us to get this child. You've changed, you're daring, you're different in the woods, more sure, more sharing, you're getting us through the woods. If you could see you're not the man who started, and much more open-hearted, than I knew you to be. It takes two. I thought one was enough, it's not true: It takes two of us. You came through when the journey was rough. It took you, it took two of us. It takes care. It takes patience and fear and despair to change, though you swear to change, who can tell if you do? It takes two. You've changed, you're thriving. There's something about the woods. Not just surviving, you're blossoming in the woods. At home I'd fear we'd stay the same forever, and then, out here, you're passionate, charming, considerate, clever— It takes one to begin, but then once you've begun, it takes two of you. It's no fun, but what needs to be done you can do, when there's two of you. If I dare, it's because I'm becoming aware of us, as a pair of us, each accepting a share of what's there. We've changed, we're strangers I'm meeting you in the woods. Who minds, what dangers? I know we'll get past the woods. And once we're past, let's hope the changes last. Beyond woods, beyond witches and slippers and hoods, just the two of us. Beyond lies, safe at home with our beautiful prize, just a few of us. It takes trust. It takes just a bit more, and we're done. We want four, we had none, we've got three. We need one. It takes two! Stop, hen! Stop that hen! Oh providence! My Milky-White. And the owners. And my hen! Look what this hen has just dropped! A golden egg! I've never seen a golden egg. You see? I promised you more than the five gold pieces that I gave you, sir. - Five gold pieces? - Now I'm taking my cow. - Five gold pieces?! - Now— I didn't say that I would sell— - But you took the five gold pieces. - You took five gold pieces? - I didn't take—you gave! - Where are the five gold pieces? - An old man had... - You said I could have my cow! I didn't say you could, I said you might. You would take money before a child? Milky-White is dead! Two! Two midnights gone! Wanting a ball is not wanting a prince... - Near may be better than far, but it still isn't there... - Near may be better than far, but it still isn't there... - The ball... - So near... - So far... - You can never love somebody else's child... - Two midnights gone! - So near... - So far... - ... the way you love your own. - The Prince... The greatest prize can often lie at the end of the thorniest path... - Two midnights gone! - Two midnights, two midnights gone! Two midnights gone. And the exhausted Baker and his wife buried the dead Milky-White. You must return to the village in search of another cow. And what do you propose I use to purchase this cow? Here. Tell them it's magic. No person with a brain larger than this is going to exchange a cow for a bean. - Then steal it. - Oh, steal it? Just two days ago, you were accusing me of exercising deceit in securing the cow. Then don't steal it, and resign yourself to a childless life. I feel it best you go for the cow, as I have met a maiden with a golden slipper these previous eves, and I think I might succeed in winning one of her shoes. - Fine. - Fine. - That is simply— - Fine! Unfortunately for Rapunzel, the witch discovered her affections for the Prince before he could spirit her away. What did I clearly say? Children must listen. No, no, please! - What were you not to do? Children must see... - No! ... and learn. Why could you not obey? Children should listen. What have I been to you? What would you have me be? Handsome like a prince? Ah, but I am old. I am ugly. I embarrass you. - No! - Yes, you are ashamed of me. - No! - You are ashamed! You don't understand. But I was lonely atop that tower. I was not company enough? I am no longer a child. I wish to see the world! Don't you know what's out there in the world? Someone has to shield you from the world. Stay with me. Princes wait there in the world, it's true. Princes, yes, but wolves and humans, too. Stay at home. I am home. Who out there could love you more than I? What out there that I cannot supply? Stay with me. Stay with me. The world is dark and wild. Stay a child while you can be a child. With me. I gave you protection, and yet, you disobeyed me. - Oh, no. - Well, did you think I would stay in that tower forever? - No, you lied! Why didn't you tell me you had a visitor?! I will not share you! But I'll show you a world you've never seen! No! - Look what you made me do! Rapunzel! Rapunzel! - When is a white cow not a white cow? - I don't know! Leave me alone. - Haven't I left you alone long enough? - Your questions make no sense, old man! - Go away! - In need of another cow? What a beautiful cape! You stay away from my cape, or I'll slice you into a thousand bits! I don't want it. I was just admiring it. My Granny made it for me, from a wolf that attacked us, and I got to skin the animal. And best of all, she gave me this beautiful knife for protection. Well, er, look what I have: a hen that lays golden eggs. I don't believe that egg came from that hen. Where did you get that egg? I stole it from the kingdom of the giant, up there. But if you think this is something, you should see the golden harp that the giant has. It plays the most beautiful tunes, without you even having to touch it. Of course it does. Well, why don't you go up to the kingdom right now, bring it back, and show me? - I could. - You could not! - I could! - You could not, Mr. Liar! I'm not a liar! I'll get that harp. You'll see. After having cast out Rapunzel to a remote desert, the witch returned to take the Prince by surprise, and as he fell from the tower, the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes and blinded him. As for Cinderella, she returned from her final visit to the festival. He's a very smart prince. He's a prince who prepares. Knowing this time I'd run from him, he spread pitch on the stairs. I was caught unawares. And I thought: Well, he cares... This is more than just malice. Better stop and take stock while you're standing here stuck on the steps of the Palace. You think, What do you want? You think, Make a decision. Why not stay and be caught? You think, Well, it's a thought, What would be his response? But then what if he knew who you were when you know that you're not what he thinks that he wants? And then what if you are what a prince would envision? Although how can you know who you are till you know what you want, which you don't? So then, which do you pick: Where you're safe, out of sight, and yourself, but where everything's wrong? Or where everything's right, and you know that you'll never belong? But whichever you pick, do it quick, 'cause you're starting to stick to the steps of the Palace! It's your first big decision. The choice isn't easy to make. To arrive at a ball is exciting and all— once you're there, though, it's scary. And it's fun to deceive when you know you can leave, but you have to be wary. There's a lot that's at stake, but you've stalled long enough 'cause you're still standing stuck in the stuff on the steps... Better run along home and avoid the collision. Even though they don't care, you'll be better off there where there's nothing to choose, so there's nothing to lose. So you pry up your shoes. Then from out of the blue, and without any guide, You know what your decision is, which is not to decide. You'll just leave him a clue: For example, a shoe. And then see what he'll do. Now it's he and not you who is stuck with a shoe, in a stew, in the goo, and you've learned something, too... - And I know things now... - Something you never knew... - And I know things now that I never knew before... - Never knew before... - Never knew before... - ... in the land of the giants! - ... in the belly of the wolf! - ... on the steps of the Palace! - Don't come any closer to me. - Please, just hear me out! We have nothing to discuss. You have attacked me once before. No, no, no. I didn't attack you. I attacked your shoe. I need it! Here. Here. Here is a magic bean in exchange for it. - Magic bean? - Mm-hmm. - Nonsense. - No, no, don't do that! I've already given up one shoe this evening. My feet cannot bear to give up another— I need that shoe to have a child! That makes no sense! Does it make any sense that you're running from a prince? - Stop! Here, here, here—take my shoes. You'll run faster. - Stop! - Who was that woman? - I do not know, sir. - Lying will cost you your life. - I've done nothing— - I've got the cow! - I've got the slipper! We've all four! I will give this to the Prince, and we'll search the Kingdom tomorrow for the maiden who will fit this shoe. - That's mine! I don't care if it costs me my life! - Give her the slipper and all will come to a happy end. What was that noise? Oh, sir, just a bolt of lightning in a far-off kingdom. How dare you take off in search without me? - My apologies, sir. I thought that I might— - Enough of what you thought! I employed a ruse and had the entire staircase smeared with pitch. And there, when she ran down, remained the maiden's slipper. - Brilliant! - I thought so. It did create quite a mess when the other guests left. - And I have succeeded in obtaining the other slipper. - Ah... Give her the slipper, and all will come to a happy end— Who are you, old man? - When first I appear, I seem deleterious— - You shut up! Er, do as he says. We only need one. There's a dead giant in my backyard! I-I heard Jack coming down the beanstalk, calling for his axe. When he reached the bottom, he took it and began hacking at the stalk. Suddenly with a crash, the beanstalk fell, but there was no sign of Jack. For all I know, he's been crushed by the ogre. Well, worrying will do you no good. If he's safe, then he's safe. Woohoo! If he's been crushed, well, then there's nothing any of us can do about that, now is there? - We must be off! I need my rest before tomorrow's search is to commence. Doesn't anyone care a giant has fallen from the sky?! - Well, he is dead, is he not? - With such a thud, I would suppose. The third midnight is here. You've all the objects? - Yes, we've the slipper, the hair,... - ... the cape, the cow. That cow doesn't look as white as milk to me. - Oh, she is! She is— That cow has been covered with flour! We did have a cow as white as milk, honestly, we did! - Then where is she? - She's dead. - We thought you'd prefer a live cow. - Well, of course I'd prefer a live cow! So bring me the dead cow, and I'll bring her back to life! - You could do that? - Now! There you are! I've been worried sick! - Mother, look: The most beautiful harp. You've stolen too much! You could've been killed coming down that plant. - She's too heavy. - What's happening? Oh Milky-White! Oh g-good girl... Milky-White! Now I have two friends: a cow and a harp. - Quiet! Feed the objects to the cow! - What?! You heard me. Feed them to the cow! Fill this. I'll do it. She'll only milk for me. Squeeze, pal. Wrong ingredients! You can forget about a child! No! No, you wait one moment! We followed your instructions! - One: That cow is as white as milk. Correct? - Yes! - And two: The cape was certainly as red as blood! - Yes! - And three: The slipper— - Yes! And four: I compared the hair to this ear of corn— I pulled it from a maiden in a tower! You what?! What were you doing there? Well, I happened to be passing by— I touched that hair! Don't you understand? I cannot have touched the ingredients! - No! - The corn! The corn! - What? The silky hair of the corn. Pull it from the ear, feed it to the cow, quickly! This had better work, old man, before the last stroke of midnight, or your son will be the last of your flesh and blood! - Son?! - Please, not now. Yes, meet your father. Father! Could it be you? I thought you died in a baking accident. - I didn't mean to run away from you, son, but there was— - It's working! She's milking! - I don't understand. - Not now! Into the cup quickly! - Well, we have given you what you wish. - Now when can we expect a child? Where are you going? - Son! Son! - Father. Father! All is repaired. He's dead! The witch, who had been punished with age and ugliness that night when her beans had been stolen and the lightning flashed, was now returned to her former state of youth and beauty. The mysterious man died, having helped end the curse on his house. For the Baker, there would be no reunion with his father, and he and his wife, bewildered, returned home. Milky-White, after a night of severe indigestion, was reunited with a now-wealthy Jack. As for the Prince, he began his search for the foot to fit the golden slipper. When he came to Cinderella's house, Cinderella's stepmother took the slipper into Florinda's room. - Careful, my toe! - Darling, I know. - What'll we do? - It'll have to go, but when you're his bride, you can sit and ride. You'll never need to walk! No, no, no! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! The girl obeyed, swallowing the pain, and joined the Prince on his horse, riding off to become his bride. Look at the blood within the shoe. This one is not the bride that's true. Search for the foot that fits. The Prince returned the false bride and asked the other sister to try on the shoe. - Why won't it fit? - Darling, be still. Cut off a bit of the heel and it will. When you're his wife, you'll have such a life, you'll never need to walk! No, no, no! Ah, ah, ah, ah! The girl obeyed and swallowed her pain. But, as she was helped on the back of the horse by the Prince, he noticed blood trickling from the shoe. - Have you no other daughters? - No! Oh! Only a stunted little kitchen wench my husband's late wife left behind. But she is much too dirty. She cannot show herself— - I insist. - And when Cinderella presented herself, and tried on the blood-soaked slipper, it fit like a glove. No blood at all within the shoe. This is the proper bride for you. Fit to attend a prince! - I see your prince has found you. - Yes! Thank you for the slipper. When the wedding with the Prince was celebrated, Lucinda and Florinda attended, wishing to win favor with Cinderella and share in her good fortune, But as the sisters stood by the blessed couple, birds swooped down upon them, and poked out their eyes, and punished them with blindness! Oh, my babies! Oh, my babies! And finally, as for Rapunzel, she bore twins and lived impoverished in the desert. Until the day her prince, wandering aimlessly, heard a voice so familiar that he went towards it. When he approached, Rapunzel, overjoyed at seeing him, fell into his arms weeping. Two of her tears wetted his eyes, and their touch restored his vision. Oh look! No! I was going to come and fetch you, just as soon as you'd learned your lesson. Who are you? Surely you remember? - Mother? - This is who I truly am! Come with me, child! We can be happy as we once were— - She will not go with you! - Let her speak for herself! No... But you're the only family I know. Come with me. You and those beautiful babies— No! You leave me no choice! Ah! Bah! Ha-ha! Come on, woohoo! As is often the way in these tales, in exchange for her youth and beauty, the witch lost her power over others! - No! And it came to pass, all that seemed wrong was now right, the kingdoms were filled with joy, and those who deserved to were certain to live a long and happy life. Ever after! - Ever after! Journey over, all is mended, and it's not just for today, But tomorrow, and extended, ever after! - Ever after! All the curses have been ended, the reverses wiped away. All is tenderness and laughter, for forever after! Happy now, and happy hence, and happy ever after! - There were dangers and confusions,... - We were frightened, but we hid it. - ... and the paths would often swerve. - We did not. - There were constant disillusions,... - It's amazing that we did it. - ... but they never lost their nerve. - Not a lot. And we reached the right conclusions. And we got what we deserved! Not a sigh and not a sorrow, tenderness and laughter. Joy today and bliss tomorrow, and forever after! - I was greedy. - I was vain. - I was haughty. - I was smug. - We were happy. - It was fun. - But we were blind. - Then we went into the woods to get our wish, and now we're really blind. I was perfect. I had everything but beauty. I had power, and a daughter like a flower, in a tower. Then I went into the woods to get my wish, and now I'm ordinary. - Lost my power and my flower. - We're unworthy. We're... unhappy now, unhappy hence, as well as ever after. Had we used our common sense, been worthy of our discontents, To be happy, and forever, you must see your wish come true. Don't be careful, don't be clever, when you see your wish, pursue. It's a dangerous endeavor, but the only thing to do— Though it's fearful, though it's deep, though it's dark, and though you may lose the path, though you may encounter wolves,... - Though it's fearful, though it's deep,... - ... you mustn't stop, you mustn't swerve,... - ... though it's dark, and though you may lose the path... - ... you mustn't ponder,... - ... though you may encounter wolves,... - Though it's fearful, though it's deep,... - ... you have to act! When you know your... - ... you mustn't stop, you mustn't swerve,... - ... though it's dark and though you may lose the path,... ... wish, if you want your wish, you can have your wish, but you can't just wish—no, to get your wish you go into the woods, where nothing's clear, where witches, ghosts, and wolves appear. Into the woods and through the fear, you have to take the journey. Into the woods and down the dell, in vain, perhaps, but who can tell? - Into the woods to lift the spell— - Into the woods to lose the longing— - Into the woods to have the child— - To wed the Prince— - To get the money— - To save the house— - To kill the wolf— - To find the father— - To conquer the kingdom— - To have, to wed, to get, to save, to kill, to keep, to go to the festival! Into the woods! Into the woods! Into the woods, then out of the woods— - To be continued... and happy ever after! Once upon a time... later... - I wish... - ... in the same far-off kingdom,... - ... more than anything,... - ... lived a young... - ... more than life,... - ... Princess, the lad... - ... more than footmen,... - I wish... - ... Jack, and the Baker with his family. - No, I miss... - I wish... - ... more than anything,... - ... more than the moon,... - There, there... - I wish to sponsor a festival. - ... more than life,... - I miss... - The time has come for a festival. - ... more than riches,... - And a ball. - I miss my kingdom up in the sky. - ... more than anything,... - I wish we had more room. - Play, Harp. - Another room... But despite some minor inconveniences, they were all content. I never thought I'd wed a prince! I never thought I'd find perfection. I never thought I could be so happy! - Not an unhappy moment since! - I didn't think we'd be this... - ... rich! - Not a conceivable objection. - I never thought we'd have a... - ... baby. - I didn't know I could be so happy! - I'm so happy! Happy now, happy hence, happy ever after... We're so happy you're so happy. Just as long as you stay happy, we'll stay happy. - Not one row... - Pots of pence... - With my cow... - Little gurgles... - Darling, I must go now. - We should really sell it. - Where's the cheesecloth? Wishes may bring problems, such that you regret them. Better that, though, than to never get them. - I'm going to be a perfect wife! - I'm going to be... - ... a perfect son! - I'm going to be a perfect mother! - I'm going to be a perfect... - ... father. - I'm going to see that he/she is so happy! I never thought I'd love my life! I would have settled for another. - Then to become a wife! - Then to be set for life! Then to beget a child! That fortune smiled... I'm so happy! If only this cottage were a little larger. Why don't we move? We will not move—this was my father's house, and now it will be my son's. You would raise your child alongside a witch? - Why does he always cry when I hold him? - Babies cry. He's fine. You needn't hold him as if he were so fragile. - Oh, he wants his mother—here. - I cannot take care of him all the time. I'll take care of him when he's older. - Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine. - And the baby? - The baby's fine. You! Have you done this to our house? Always thinking of yourself. - Look at my garden! - What of your garden? - Look! - Destroyed. - What has happened? I was thrown to the ground. I saw nothing. - What could do such a thing? - An earthquake. No earthquake... My garden has been trampled. Those are footprints! Who could do such a thing? Anything that leaves a footprint that large is no "who." - Do you think it was a bear? - A bear? Bears are sweet. Besides, you ever see a bear with 40-foot feet? - Dragon? - No scorch marks—usually they're linked. - Manticore? - Imaginary. - Griffin? - Extinct. Giant? Possible. Very, very possible. A giant... Maybe we should tell someone. - Mm-hmm. Who are you going to tell? - Why, the royal family, of course. - The royal family? I wouldn't count on that family to snuff out a rat! With a giant, we'll all have to go to battle. A giant's the worst! A giant has a brain! Hard to outwit a giant. A giant's just like us, only bigger. Much, much bigger. So big that we are all just an expendable bug beneath its foot. Boom! Crunch! We are moving! Look, Milky-White. It's the butcher. - The Baker. - The Baker... What can we do for you, sir? I'm here to investigate the destruction that was wrought upon our house today— Jack's been home with me all day. I fear there's a giant in the land. I can recognize a giant's footstep! I could go to your house— - You'll do no such thing! - Any help at all— No one cared when there was a giant in my backyard! A giant in your backyard is one thing. A crushed home is quite another. Listen, young man. Giants never strike the same house twice. I wouldn't worry. I'm taking this news to the castle, nonetheless. Excuse me, Madame. This small man insists on seeing you. Princess, I'm here to report the appearance of a giant in the sky. Where did you see a giant? Well, I didn't exactly see him. Then how do you know there is a giant in the land? Our house was crushed. And there are footprints— Oh, that could have been caused by any number of things. Look, I'll show you to the door— - But-but wait! Look, a nearby household was visited by a giant not long ago, descending from a beanstalk. - Yes, I remember! - That giant was slain. Now, come along. - No, wait please. We have a young child. Princess, our child was very difficult to come by. His safety is of the greatest importance to me. - Are we entirely through now? - Yes. I'll see to it that the Prince hears of this when he returns. Thank you! I'm going off to sell the harp, Jack. - Mother, no! - Listen to me, Jack. We don't want that harp around here when there's a giant on the loose! - But I know how to kill a giant! - Enough! Now promise me, son, you won't leave your surroundings. But Mother, I am a man now! You're still a little boy in your mother's eyes. I want you to promise. Promise! I promise. What happened to your house? We've had a baking accident. - A baking accident? - No use frightening the young thing. Can't frighten her. Well, I guess Granny'll have to do without the bread and sweets. Besides, I have all I can carry. Why such a load? I'm moving in with Granny. We had an accident, too. I came home to find our house collapsed, as if a big wind blew it in. I couldn't find my mother anywhere. - Oh, no. So I salvaged what I could, and now I'm off. Oh, good friends! What news have you? What of the Prince? What-what of Mother's grave? What kind of trouble? Oh no, I can't investigate. A princess is not supposed to go into the woods unescorted. Oh, good idea! I will disguise myself and go and see what's wrong. Thank you, birds! - We'll take you to Granny's. - What?! - Well, we're not going to let her go on her own. - All right, I'll take you— But I don't need anyone to take me. I've gone many times before— - But not when such winds are blowing. - That's right. We'll all go. - No! I'm not about to stay here with the baby, when a "wind" might return to this house, too. I know Mother made me promise, but I'm going to find that giant anyway. Into the woods, it's always when you think at last you're through, and then, into the woods you go again to take another journey. Into the woods, the weather's clear, we've been before, we've naught to fear. Into the woods, away from here. - Into the woods, to find a giant! Into the woods to Grandmother's house. Into the woods, the path is straight, no reason then to hesitate. Into the woods, it's not so late, it's just another journey. Into the woods, but not too long: The skies are strange, the winds are strong. Into the woods to see what's wrong. Into the woods to slay the giant! Into the woods to shield the child— - To flee the winds. - To find a future. - To shield... - To slay... - To flee... - To find... - To fix... - To hide... To move... To battle... To see what the trouble is... Hey... You're all right. Shush... - Rapunzel! - Oh God... What are you doing here? Oh, what's the matter? Nothing. You just locked me in a tower without company for all my life, and then you blinded my prince, then you banished me to the desert, where I had little to eat, and again no company, and then bore twins! 'Cause of the way you treated me, I'll never, ever be happy. I was just trying to be a good mother. Oh, stay with me! There's a giant running about! - No. N-no. - Good brother, what a surprise! - Brother, how good to see you! - And what brings you into the wood today? - I'm investigating news of a giant. - You, investigating news of a giant? - Mm-hmm. - Father would not even do that! That is business for your steward, or less. - Well, what brings you into the wood? My Rapunzel has run off. - Run off? - She's a changed woman. She's been subject to hysterical fits of crying, moods that no soul could predict. I know not what to do. What a pity. - And Cinderella? - Oh, she remains well. Does she? Now, brother... do tell what you're really doing here. High in a tower, like yours was, but higher, a beauty asleep. All round the tower, a thicket of briar, a hundred feet deep. Agony! No frustration more keen. When the one thing you want is a thing that you've not even seen. I found a casket entirely of glass— no, it's unbreakable. And inside—don't ask it—a maiden, alas. Just as unwakeable... - What unmistakable... Agony! Is the way always barred? She has skin white as snow. - Did you learn her name? - No, there's a dwarf standing guard. Agony! Such that princes must weep. Always in thrall most to anything almost, or something asleep. If it were not for the thicket... A thicket's no trick. Is it thick? - It's the thickest. - The quickest is pick it apart with a stick. Yes, but even one prick—it's my thing about blood. Well, it's sick. It's no sicker than your thing with dwarves— - Dwarfs. - Dwarfs... Dwarfs are very upsetting. Not forgetting the tasks unachievable, mountains unscaleable, if it's conceivable but unavailable—ahhh! - Agony! - Misery! - Woe! Not to know what you miss. - While they lie there for years— - And you cry on their biers— What unbearable bliss! Agony! That can cut like a knife. Ah well... Back to my wife... Rapunzel. I must be going. Godspeed to you, brother. - Godspeed! - Are you certain this is the right direction? - We went down the dell. - Perhaps you forgot your way. - The path is straight! Was straight. Now there is no path. Well, where's the stream? Where's the lily pond? Where's Granny? Calm down. Maybe we should go home. - No! - We'll just have to find Granny's house without the path. But Mother warned me to never stray from the path. The path has strayed from you. Oh wait! That looks familiar. See in the distance, three oak trees? - Yes, I recognize them. - Who might that be? - It's the royal family. - Oh. What brings you into the woods? - Oh! Oh! The castle has been set on by a giant! - Oh no! I warned you! Why didn't you do something? I don't make policy—I just carry it out. And I warned you that you can't count on a royal family to solve your problems. - I think it best we return to the village. - I wouldn't be in such a rush if I were you. Guess which path the giant took to the castle? - Oh no! - What?! All that's left of my garden is a sack of beans! And there's not much left of your house, either. But I heard that giants never strike the same house twice. You heard wrong! There! The giant's a woman! - That size! - Where is the lad who killed my husband? - There is no lad here. - We haven't seen him. I want the lad who climbed the beanstalk. We'll get him for you right away! Don't move! It was you who destroyed our house, not a great wind! It's because of you I've no mother! And who destroyed my house? That boy asked for shelter, and then he stole our gold, our hen, and our harp. Then, he killed my husband! I must avenge the wrongdoings. We are not responsible for him! - You're wasting your breath. She's right. You can't reason with a dumb giant. Not all giants are dumb. Give me the boy, Jack! - We told you, he's not here! - The girl is telling the truth! - Yes! I know he's there. And I'm going to wait right here until he's delivered to me! - Put a spell on her. - I no longer have my powers. If I did, you think I'd be standing here with all of you? Now, we're going to have to give her someone. - Who? - The steward. It's in his line of duty to sacrifice his life. - Don't be ridiculous! I'm not giving up my life for anyone! I'm waiting. Excuse me! Would you like a blind girl instead? How dare you?! Oh, put them out of their misery. We're not that miserable! - What are you talking about? - She doesn't want a woman. Fine. Then what do you suggest we do? I'm still waiting! I tell the story—I'm not part of it. - That's right. - Not one of us! - Always on the outside. That's my role, you must understand! There must always be someone on the outside! - You're going to be on the inside now. - You're making a big mistake! - Nonsense. You need an objective observer to pass the story along. Some of us don't like the way you've been telling it. You'll never know how your story ends. You'll be lost! Think of your baby— - Stop! Stop, he's right! Put him down! And put that knife away. - Here's the lad! - No! No, please! No! - I'm not that lad! - This is not the lad! - Don't drop— - Ahhhh! Why did you push him into her arms? - You wanted to get rid of him, too. - We might have thought of something else. If it was up to you, a decision would never be made. - Now that he's gone, we'll never know what will happen next. - We'll manage. We'll manage— Must I search among you for the lad? - No! - Jack is just a boy! We had no food to eat, and he sold his beloved cow, in exchange for magic beans. If anyone is to be punished, it's the man who made that exchange. - That's right! - Nonsense. - He was your responsibility. Now I must punish him for his wrongs. We've suffered, too. Do you think it was a picnic, disposing of your husband's remains? You're getting me angry! Yeah, what about our anger? What about our loss? Who's been flouncing through our Kingdom? - Shh. Be quiet! I'll hide my son, and you'll never find him— - Don't upset the giant. - You'll never, never find him— - I'm warning you! - And if you don't go back this instant, we'll get you for all that you've done! We'll— Where is your son? Is that him? - No! No, this is not the boy. Stay here. The boy is hiding in the steeple tower! - That's true. - Yes! If he is not, I will return and find you. - Rapunzel. Rapunzel! Please! - Stay away from me! - Rapunzel! Please! - Don't step on the... She's in poor condition. Don't let them get Jack. - We won't. - Promise me you won't let him be hurt, as I stand here, at death's door. - I'll do all I can. - Promise. Promise! All right, I promise. No, you come away from there. You killed her! I was thinking of the greater good. That's my job. This is the world I meant. Couldn't you listen? Couldn't you stay content, safe behind walls, as I could not? Now you know what's out there in the world. No one stays untainted by the world. Only I... Only I, who loved you as you were... Only I, who's frightened less of her than them. No matter what you say, children won't listen. No matter what you know, children refuse to learn. Guide them along the way, still they won't listen. Children can only grow from something you love to something you lose! Life was so steady, and now this. When will everything return to normal? We must be gone if we are to arrive before nightfall. - Where are you going? - We're off to a hidden kingdom. - Oh, shush. We can't take everyone. - Fools! There's nowhere to hide. You'll never get there! We have to stay here and get out of this together. Some people are cut out to do battle with giants, some are not. I do not have the constitution. And as long as I can be of no help, I'm going to hide. Everything'll work out fine in the end. Come. Not always. I hope a giant steps on them all. You shouldn't say that. You were thinking the same thing. Well, this is awful! We've just seen three people die! Since when are you so squeamish? How many wolves have you carved up? - A wolf's not the same! - Ask a wolf's mother! - Stop it! I suggest we find that boy now and give her what she wants. If we give her Jack, she'll kill him, too. - And if we don't, she'll kill half the Kingdom. - One step at a time. Maybe—maybe if he apologizes, makes amends— Yes! He'll return the stolen goods. - Yes! - He's really a sweet boy at heart—she'll see that. You people are so blind! It's because of that boy that there is a giant in our land. Now, while you continue talking about the problem, I'll find the lad, and I'll serve him to the giant for lunch. Are we going to let her feed the boy to the giant? - No. - I'll have to find him first— - I'll go, too. - No! You stay here with the baby— No, we'll fan out. It'll increase our chances of finding him— No, no, I do not want you roaming about the woods. You're to stay here, with the baby. You would leave our child with her? Yes. The baby's asleep. He'll be safe with the girl— - But what if the giant were to return here? - The giant will not harm them. I know. - How do you know? - I know. - Yeah, but what if? - What if? But what if?! Will only a giant's foot stop your arguing? You will stay here, with the baby. Please! Do you two always argue like that? No, not really. - Seems like you do. - And there's nothing wrong with having an argument. Oh, I see. Milky! Milky! - That's him! - Jack! - Jack!- Jack! Milky! - Stay here with the baby. - But I want to come! - No, you will be safer here. - Don't go too far, please! I will only take one hundred paces. If I don't find the boy, I'll come right back. Jack! Jack! One, two, three,... Jack! Jack! 81, 82, 83,... Hello, sir! - Hello. - You must be here to slay the giant. - Yes. - Have you come upon the giant yet? - No. - I have. - You have? - Yes. And why are you alone in the woods? Oh, no, no—I came with my husband. We were... Well, it's a long story. He would let you roam alone in the woods? No, actually, it was my choice. I'm looking for a lad. Your choice? How brave. - Brave? - Yes. Anything can happen in the woods. May I kiss you? Any moment we could be crushed. Don't feel rushed. This is ridiculous. What am I doing here? I'm in the wrong story. Oh, no, no, wait, one moment please! We can't do this... You have a princess! - Oh yes, I do. And I have a... baker. Yes, of course. You're right. I... How foolish. - Yes. Foolishness can happen in the woods. Once again, please. - But you— Let your hesitations be hushed. Any moment, big or small, is a moment after all. Seize the moment—skies may fall any moment. This is not right. Right and wrong don't matter in the woods, only feelings. Let us meet the moment unblushed. Yes? Life is often so unpleasant. You must know that, as a peasant. Best to take the moment present as a present for the moment. Yes... Jack! Jack! Jack! Ja— What's wrong? May I be of some service? The tree has fallen. Mother's grave destroyed. - Oh, I'm sorry. - My wishes have just been crushed. - Oh don't say that. It's true. You wouldn't understand. Well, you can't stay here. There's a giant on the loose! I'm certain the Prince will see to it that the giant is rid from our land. Oh, there's been no sign of the Prince. No doubt he's off seducing some young maiden somewhere. - What? - I understand that's what princes do. Not all princes! You look just like the Princess. But dirty. You are the Princess. But dirty. Please, get up, get up. I'm not a princess here. - Well, what... what are you to do? - I... I must be on my way back to the castle. Oh, you haven't heard. We came upon the royal family. The castle has been set upon by the giant. And the Prince? - He was not with them. You must come with me. Er, you'll be safe in our company. I must leave you. Why? - The giant. - Oh, hmm, the giant. I had almost forgotten. Will we find each other in the woods again? - Oh God... This was just a moment in the woods. Our moment, shimmering and lovely and sad. Hmm? Leave the moment, just be glad for the moment that we had. Every moment is of moment when you're in the woods. Ah! Now I must go off to slay a giant. That is what the next moment holds for me. I shall not forget you. How brave you were, to be alone in the woods. - Oh! And how alive you made me feel. What was that? Was that me? Was that him? Did a prince really kiss me? And kiss me? And kiss me? And did I kiss him back? Was it wrong? Am I mad? Is that all? Does he miss me? Was he suddenly getting bored with me? Wake up! Stop dreaming. Stop prancing about the woods. It's not beseeming. What is it about the woods? Back to life, back to sense, back to child, back to husband, no one lives in the woods. There are vows, there are ties, there are needs, there are standards, there are shouldn'ts and shoulds. Why not both instead? There's the answer, if you're clever: Have a child for warmth, and a baker for bread, and a prince for whatever... Never! It's these woods. Face the facts, find the boy, join the group, stop the giant— just get out of these woods. Was that him? Yes it was. Was that me? No, it wasn't. Just a trick of the woods. Just a moment, one peculiar, passing moment. Must it all be either less or more, either plain or grand? Is it always "or"? Is it never "and"? That's what woods are for, for those moments in the woods. Oh, if life were made of moments, even now and then a bad one... But if life were only moments, then you'd never know you had one. First a witch, then a child, then a prince, then a moment... Who can live in the woods? And to get what you wish, only just for a moment... These are dangerous woods. Let the moment go... Don't forget it for a moment, though. Just remembering you've had an "and" when you're back to "or" makes the "or" mean more than it did before. Now I understand and it's time to leave the woods. No! No, please! Don't— She should be back by now. - She said she'd only go a hundred paces. - I'm sure she'll return. - No, I'd better go and look for her. Which direction did she go? - Oh, she— - Look who I found! - Please don't let her give me to the giant— - It's not our fault the giant wants you! - Ow, you're hurting me— - Let go of him! - Leave him alone! - Where did you find this? Where's my wife? She's dead. What? I'm sorry, sir. I came upon her—she was under a tree. He was sobbing over her like she was his own mother. - How awful... - How could this happen? I buried her in a footprint. What was I thinking? I should have just stayed with her! - Remorse will get you nowhere. - My wife is dead! - Oh, wake up! People are dying all around you! You're not the only one to suffer a loss. When you're dead, you're dead. Now it's time to get this boy to the giant, before we're all so much dead meat— - Keep away from him! - No! - This is no time to be soft-hearted. He's going to the giant, and I'm taking him. - Yes, he's to blame. It's because of him there's a giant in our midst, and my wife is dead. But it isn't my fault I was given those beans. You persuaded me to trade away my cow for beans. And without those beans, there'd have been no stalk, to get up to the giant's in the first place! - Wait a minute— Magic beans for a cow so old that you had to tell a lie to sell it, which you told! Were they worthless beans? Were they oversold? And tell us, who persuaded you to steal that gold? - See, it's your fault. - No! - Yes, it's your fault. - No! - Yes, it is! - It's not! - It's true. - Wait a minute— Though I only stole the gold to get my cow back from you! - So it's your fault! - Yes! - No, it isn't! I'd have kept those beans, but our house was cursed. She made us get a cow to get the curse reversed. It's his father's fault that the curse got placed, and the place got cursed in the first place! - Oh, then it's his fault! - So? - It was his fault. - No. - Yes, it is. It's his. - I guess... - Wait a minute, though. I chopped down the beanstalk, right? That's clear. But without any beanstalk, then what's queer is how did the second giant get down here in the first place... second place? - Yes! - How? - Hmm... - Well, who had the other bean? - The other bean? - The other bean? - You pocketed the other bean. - I didn't. Yes, I did! - So it's your f— - No, it isn't, 'cause I gave it to my wife! - So, it's her f— - No, it isn't! - Then whose is it? - Wait a minute. She exchanged that bean to obtain your shoe, so the one who knows what happened to the bean is you! You mean that old bean that you wife...? Oh dear. But I never knew, and so I threw... Well, don't look here! - So, it's your fault! - But... - See, it's her fault. - But... - And it isn't mine at all! - But what? Well, if you hadn't gone back up again... - We were needy! - You were greedy! Did you need that hen? - But I got it for my mother. - So, it's her fault then. - Yes, and what about the harp in the third place? - The harp, yes— - She went and dared me to. - I dared you to? - You dared me to. She said that I was scared to. - Me? She dared me! - No, I didn't! - So, it's your fault! - Wait a minute. - If you hadn't dared him to... - And you had left the harp alone... - Well, if... - ... we wouldn't be in this trouble in the first place! - ... you hadn't thrown away the beans in the first place! - If she hadn't raised them in the first place... - You raised the beans in the first place! It's your fault! You're responsible! You're the one to blame! It's your fault! - Shh... It's the last midnight. It's the last wish. It's the last midnight. Soon it will be boom... squish! Told a little lie, stole a little gold, broke a little vow, did you? Had to get your prince, had to get your cow, have to get your wish, doesn't matter how, anyway, it doesn't matter now. It's the last midnight. It's the boom... splat! Nothing but a vast midnight. Everybody smashed flat! Nothing we can do... Not exactly true. We can always give her the boy! - No! - No? No, of course what really matters is the blame, someone you can blame. Fine, if that's the thing you enjoy, placing the blame. If that's the aim, give me the blame... Just give me the boy! - No! No... You're so pure, but stay here, and in time, you'll mature, and grow up to be them. So let's fly, you and I, far away... - Please! I'm the hitch, I'm what no one believes, I'm the witch, they're all liars and thieves, like his father, just like you will be too. Oh, why bother? They'll just do what they do. It's the last midnight. So, goodbye all. Coming at you fast, midnight. Soon you'll see the sky fall. Here, you want a bean? Have another bean. Beans were made for making you rich! Plant them, and they'll soar. Here, you want some more?! Listen to the roar: giants by the score! Oh well, you can blame another witch. It's the last midnight. It's the last verse. So, before it's past midnight, I'm leaving you my last curse. I'm leaving you alone. You can tend the garden, it's yours. Separate and alone, everybody down on all fours. All right Mother, when? Lost the beans again! Punish me the way you did then! Give me claws and a hunch— just away from this bunch, and the gloom, and the doom, and the boom... Mother, here I come! Maybe I shouldn't have stolen from the giant. Maybe I shouldn't have strayed from the path. Maybe I shouldn't have attended the ball. Yes, maybe you shouldn't have. - Where are you going? - Away from here. But you said we had to find our way out of this together! It doesn't matter whether we're together or apart. We need your help. You don't understand. My wife was the only person who really helped. I depended on her for everything. You would leave your child? My child will be happier in the arms of a princess. But wait! All right. All right. Let's go. Jack! I thought you were dead. Not completely. Are we ever? - As far I am concerned, you are. - Is that true? - It's because of you all of this has happened. I strayed into the garden to give your mother a gift. And I foolishly took some of those beans for myself. Well, how was I to know? How are we ever to know? And when she died, I... I ran from my guilt. And now aren't you making the same mistake? - No. Aren't you running away? No more questions, please. No more tests. Comes the day you say, "What for?" Please... no more. We disappoint, we disappear, we die, but we don't. What? They disappoint in turn, I fear. Forgive, though, they won't. No more riddles. No more jests. No more curses you can't undo, left by fathers you never knew. No more quests. No more feelings. Time to shut the door. Just... no more. Running away? Let's do it. Free from the ties that bind. No more despair, burdens to bear, out there in the yonder. Running away? Go to it. Where did you have in mind? Have to take care—unless there's a "where," you'll only be wandering blind. Just more questions— different kind. Where are we to go? Where are we ever to go? Running away? We'll do it. Why sit around, resigned? The trouble is, son, the farther you run, the more you feel undefined for what you have left undone, and more, what you've left behind. We disappoint, we leave a mess, we die, but we don't. We disappoint in turn, I guess. Forget, though, we won't. Life father, like son. No more giants, waging war. Can't we just pursue our lives with our children and our wives? Until that happier day arrives, how do you ignore all the witches, all the curses, all the wolves, all the lies, the false hopes, the goodbyes, the reverses, all the wondering what even worse is still in store? All the children... All the giants... No more. - I knew you wouldn't give up. - He wouldn't leave his baby. Looked like he was going to. Give me my son. He always cries when I hold him. What are we to do now? - We must have a plan before the giant returns. - What? We all have to think... If there was just some way we could surprise her... She's too tall to surprise. Oh, good friends! I need your help now more than ever. What of the Prince? I don't care! What we need now is a way to fell the giant. How can you help? You could do that? How can I ever thank you? You can talk to birds? - The birds will help. - How? When the giant returns, they'll attack her and peck out her eyes, till she's blind! - What good will that do? - Well then you can surprise her, strike her, or whatever you do to kill a giant. Blinded, she'll stagger about— - She'll get angry. - And she'll crush us all! Smear the ground with pitch! We'll lure her to an area smeared with pitch. Her shoes will stick, and she won't be able to move— And I will strike her from behind. How will you strike her, and lure her where? Yeah, where? - A tower! - What tower? - Over there, between those two trees—an old tower! Oh, yes! Send her to the tower! All right. All right. We have to do something quick. It'll be dark soon. - Here. - Thank you. - I'm excited! - Come on! You miss your mother... Hello. The giant went in that direction. My darling! I didn't recognize you. What are you doing in those old clothes, and with a child? You must go back to the castle at once. There's a giant on the loose. - The giant has been to the castle. - No! Are you all right? My love, why are you being so cold? Maybe because I'm not your only love. Am I? I love you. I do. Yes, it's true. Why, if you love me, would you have strayed? I thought if you were mine, that I would never wish for more. And part of me is content, and as happy as I've ever been. But there remains a part of me that continually needs more. I have, on occasion, wanted more, but that doesn't mean I went in search of it. If this is how you behave as a prince, what kind of king will you be? I was raised to be charming, not sincere. I didn't ask to be born a king. And I'm not perfect. I'm only human. - I think you should go. - Leave? But I do love you. Consider that I have been lost—a victim of the giant— Is that what you really wish? My father's house was a nightmare. Your house was a dream. Now, I want something in between. Please go. I shall always love the maiden who ran away. And I the faraway prince. You see over there, between the two towers? When the giant comes, we're to send her over there. - Good. I wanted to climb the tower, too. I'm glad you're here to help me. Well, what's wrong? My Granny's gone. Oh no! I'm so sorry. I think my Granny and my mother would be upset with me. Why? They said to always make them proud. And here I am, about to kill somebody. - Not somebody— a giant, who has been doing harm. But the giant's a person. Aren't we to show forgiveness? Mother would be very unhappy with these circumstances. Mother cannot guide you. Now you're on your own. Only me beside you, still, you're not alone. No one is alone, truly. No one is alone. Sometimes people leave you halfway through the wood. Others may deceive you, you decide what's good. You decide alone, but no one is alone. I wish... I know. Wait until my mother hears I've slain the giant. Jack. Your mother is dead. Dead? Was she killed by the giant? She was arguing with the giant, trying to protect you, and she was struck a deadly blow by the Prince's steward. Oh... No! Why would he do that? He was afraid she was provoking the giant. Can no one bring her back? No one. That steward will pay for this. After we slay the giant, I will slay him! - You will do nothing of the kind— - But he shouldn't have killed my mother, right? - Well, I guess not. Then he must die. - Well, no. - Why not? - Because that would be wrong. - What he did was wrong. He should be punished. - He will be, somehow. - How?! I don't know! Stop asking me questions that I cannot answer. - I'm going to kill him. - Oh, then kill him. No, don't kill him. - Mother isn't here now. - Wrong things, right things... - Who knows what she'd say? - Who can say what's true? - Nothing's quite so clear now... - Do things, fight things... - Feel you've lost your way? - You decide, but You are not alone. - Believe me. - No one is alone. - No one is alone. - Believe me. - Truly. You move just a finger, say the slightest word, something's bound to linger, be heard. No one acts alone. Careful, no one is alone. People make mistakes. Fathers. - Mothers. - People make mistakes, holding to their own, thinking they're alone. - Honor their mistakes. - Fight for their mistakes. - Everybody makes... - ... one another's terrible mistakes. Witches can be right, giants can be good. You decide what's right. You decide what's good. - Just remember: - Just remember: Someone is on your side. - Our side. - Our side. Someone else is not. While we're seeing our side, - Our side... - Our side... Maybe we forgot: They are not alone. No one is alone. Hard to see the light now. Just don't let it go. Things will come out right now. We can make it so. Someone is on your si— Oh, here she comes. Remember, don't let her know our plan. Where is the boy? - We don't know! - Yes, we do! We can't go on hiding him any longer. He must pay the price for his wrongs. Quick! Tell me where he is. Over there. See that tower, where the birds are clustered? Jack is in that tower, hiding. - Thank you. Now, justice will be served. And I will leave your kingdom. - Good birds! - Oh, she doesn't look happy. - That axe is stuck in her head! - But they've done it. She's swaying! - She's bleeding all over! - She's beginning to fall! - She's beginning to fall this way! - Ahh! The slotted spoon can catch the potato. Every knot was once straight rope. The harder to wake, the better to have. Excuse me. The greater the good, the harder the blow. When going to hide, know how to get there. - And how to get back. - And eat first. The knife that is sharp today may be dull by tomorrow. Do you know what you wish? Are you certain what you wish is what you want? Now we can all return home. And let us hope there's no more killing. Where am I to go? I've got no one to take care of me. You'll have to take care of yourself now, Jack. It's time. - No, it's not. I'll take care of him. - You will? - Yeah, I'll be your mother now. I don't want another mother. I want a friend. And a pet. Of course, we have nowhere to go, so we'll move in with you. Oh, no... - It'll be fun! - My house is a shambles. There isn't room for... Course you can come home with us. And you shall join us, too. You'll not return to the castle? I'll gladly help you with your house. There are times when I actually enjoy cleaning. How proud your wife would have been of you. And how sad that my son will never know her. Maybe I just wasn't meant to have children. Don't say that. Of course you were meant to have children. How will I go about being a father, with no one to mother my child? Just calm the child. Yes, calm the child. - Look— tell him the story of how it all happened. Be father and mother. You'll know what to do. Alone? Sometimes people leave you halfway through the wood. Do not let it grieve you— no one leaves for good. You are not alone. No one is alone. Son? Son? Son? Son! Son! Son! Hold him to the light now, let him feel the glow. Things will be all right now. Tell him what you know. Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, lived a young maiden, a sad, young lad, a childless baker with his wife... Careful the things you say, children will listen. Careful the things you do, children will see, and learn. Children may not obey, but children will listen. Children will look to you for which way to turn, to learn what to be. Careful before you say, "Listen to me." Children will listen. How do you say to your child in the night, nothing's all black, but then nothing's all white? How can you say it will all be all right when you know that it mightn't be true? What do you do? What do you leave to your child when you're dead? Only whatever you put in its head. Things that your father and mother had said, which were left to them, too. Careful what you say! - Careful the wish you make, wishes are children. Careful the path they take, wishes come true, not free. Careful the spell you cast, not just on children. Sometimes the spell may last past what you can see, and turn against you. Careful the tale you tell. That is the spell. Children will listen... Though it's fearful, though it's deep, though it's dark, and though you may lose the path,... - ... though you may encounter wolves,... - Though it's fearful, though it's deep,... - ... you can't just act, - ... though it's dark and though you may lose the path,... - ... you have to listen. You can't... - ... though you may encounter wolves, you can't... - Though it's fearful, though it's deep, though it's dark, - ... just act, you have to think. - ... just act, you have to listen. - ... and though you may lose the path,... There are always wolves, there are always spells, there are always beans, or a giant dwells there. So into the woods you go again, you have to every now and then. Into the woods, no telling when, be ready for the journey. Into the woods, but not too fast, or what you wish you lose at last. Into the woods, but mind the past. Into the woods, but mind the future. Into the woods, but not to stray, or tempt the wolf, or steal from the giant. The way is dark, the light is dim. But now there's you, me, her, and him. - The chances look small. - The choices look grim. But everything you learn there will help when you return there. The light is getting dimmer. - I think I see a glimmer. Into the woods, you have to grope, but that's the way you learn to cope. Into the woods to find there's hope of getting through the journey. Into the woods, each time you go, there's more to learn of what you know. Into the woods, but not too slow... Into the woods, it's nearing midnight... Into the woods to mind the wolf, to heed the witch, to honor the giant, to mind, to heed, to find, to think, to teach, to join, to go to the festival! Into the woods! Into the woods! Into the woods, then out of the woods... and happy ever after! I wish...
