The world is a very narrow bridge A very narrow bridge The world is a very narrow bridge But what's really important is not to be afraid, not afraid at all But what's really important is not to be afraid, not afraid at all In verses 6 and 7, it is said, "If you come across "a bird's nest beside the road, in any tree or on the ground, "and the mother's sitting on the young or on the eggs, "do not take the mother. "You may take the young, but let the mother go. "So you shall thrive and live long." Commentators debate over the meaning of "If you come across a bird's nest in any tree or on the ground." What does "on any tree" mean? "On any tree" is unnecessary. But in the Torah, there are no unnecessary words. Here, it is said, "On any tree" Why is the text so specific? According to Rabbi Shalom Sharabi, "On any tree" points to... "On any tree" means... Even if I thought that on a fruit tree the precept doesn't apply if fruits from that tree are not edible, in this case, even for a fruit tree, the precept of letting the mother go does apply. Even for a fruit tree. That's what "on any tree" means. It's also said that those who abide by this precept and who don't have children can have children. Why? Because... The Torah says to chase away the mother and then to take the young. Why chase away the mother? Theoretically, you may chase her away and take the young Why do you have to chase away the mother first? You may take the young. What does this mean? Rabbi Asher ben Yehiel explains: This way, you don't make the mother see you're taking her little ones away. So you chase the mother away first and spare her the grief. It's a precept and those who abide by it can have children. Why? Because they pity living things, created by the Holy One, blessed be He. So the Holy One, blessed be He, pities them And give them children that will be his descendants, to carry on with... Jaffa Street. Well done. When they play, they don't have enough energy, you see? When they run to the goal, they have to run with all their force, you know? Tomorrow morning, I want... They love you, this is all love. Yes, but... Look, it's amazing. You don't have this kind of audience in Europe. - I want you to be concentrated. - Of course. At eight o'clock in the morning, I want them on the field. No problem, everybody, except one player. He has problems in the morning. If he wants to play, he'll be on the field at eight in the morning. - Tomorrow... - Ten o'clock in the morning, breakfast, - and then I want a game. - Of course, we will do it. Listen to me. Concentrate. Don't be... Look at this audience! Isn't this amazing? You don't have this kind of thing in Europe. Come, let's go inside. I need you to come with me. You know, football, it's not just a game... Hi, how are you? I'm Luna. I'm the assistant coach, nice to meet you. I'm a journalist with the Post. I just want to ask you a few questions about the team. We've never had such a great coach in Israel. Beitar Jerusalem will go down in history. With him, local soccer will take off. We've never had anyone like him in Israeli sport. He's bringing the right mindset, the right dynamic. They've changed their habits. They're on time for training. Even the team's owner is thrilled to have him around. He's on time for training, too. The change of attitude is spectacular. Just tell me, what do you think about the audience, first of all? The audience love him. Can't you feel the atmosphere? Ever seen this elsewhere? They walk with him to the market and everywhere. They love him. What a change! We're writing history. Excuse me. Please, let me get a word in. I'll ask you another question. Concerning the players, are they as professional as the ones in France? They are. Beitar Jerusalem's never had such good players. You can quote me, too. We'll win the championship and, God willing, let me tell you... - What is he saying? - We'll win the European Cup. He's telling me your life story. But I've been here only two weeks, he doesn't know me. In two weeks, we got close. It's not only about work. We're true friends. We hit it off right from the start. I'll tell you what he told me when people talked about him. Wait! At 5, he attended a Beitar Jerusalem game. He already dreamed of training this team. A coach like him is a dream come true. This has been happening to me since the day I arrived in Israel. It's typical Israeli. I can't get a single word in. Just tell me about yourself. Such a warm welcome! Beitar Jerusalem's the national team. Look at the supporters, how welcoming they are. Everyone loves him. What about the food? It's one of a kind... Do you like the food in Jerusalem? Hummus! He loves falafels, doesn't he? I hate hummus. He orders falafels and hummus all the time. He loves Israeli food. Maybe we should get together after the game. If he's with you all the time, it will be really hard. It is going to be hard, but if you need to ask me a few questions... - Just one question, please. - Of course, with pleasure. Are the players professional enough to be in the Champion's League? We have a recruiter and he calls him for every game. He knows the Israeli League inside out. Our relationships go beyond work. Anyone familiar with Judea and Samaria knows that the Oslo Accords were cut off from reality. 400,000 people live in Judea and Samaria. 250,000 in East Jerusalem. There will be no Palestinian state. You think I still care about this country? About this government that defines this country as Jewish? What matters to me is where I was born. They tell us we're outcasts. A demographic problem. Thorns in your arse. How are you? Why don't you answer? - You live in the neighborhood? - No. I see you often around here. I'm going to visit someone. With all these bags? Are you with the police? No, security. Great. I'm trying to get to know you. Thanks, but I'm not interested. Gaby! Mali! It's good to see you. You like the way I look? - Terrific. - You like it? Awesome. You're to die for. The other day, I felt hopeless compared to you. Why are you laughing? What's the matter with you? - Look at you, you're gorgeous. - Really? I love your looks. Gaby. - Look. - What is it? Look. - They're gorgeous! - Aren't they? They're awesome! I wish they had higher heels. Higher than this? When would you wear them? - In bed. - Really? I told you I only saw him in bed. Is it good? - Not bad. - Is that it? Yes, that's it. This affair scares me. - I'm sorry I even told you. - I can keep a secret. I should hope so. Do you see him in secret? Are you allowed to call him? If we have to call it off, it won't change my life. We only spend a few hours together. Nothing important. Do you love him? I hardly know him. You should call it off right away. I can't do it. How good is it? It's okay. But I can't help it. The secrecy, all this... this madness. As if we were both secret agents in enemy territory. Simon the Just. What's the point of all this? So he risks everything for me. Everything. It reminds me of a film I saw a long time ago. About a girl who... falls in love with her boss. He buys her an apartment and comes to see her whenever he can. Until the day he stops coming. But she keeps waiting for him all her life. I can't remember the ending. I haven't seen it. Maybe I haven't either. I may have heard about it. Where are we? I'm getting off here. We're getting to Damascus Gate. Gaby darling. Mali. Be careful. Don't you worry. Bye. It was good to see you. If you don't scream "Long live freedom!" with humility, you don't scream "Long live freedom!" If you don't scream "Long live freedom!" laughing, you don't scream "Long live freedom!" If you don't scream "Long live freedom!" with love, you don't scream "Long live freedom!" Duchifat Battalion. You, sons of sons, scream "Long live freedom!" with contempt, with rage, and with hate. You, sons of sons, do not scream "Long live freedom!" So... Christ faced the prostitute about to be stoned. And he said to them: "Let he who is "without sin... "Let any one of you who is without sin... "cast "the first stone "at this adulterous woman." Pisgat Zeev city-center Those who heard him speak began to go away one by one. until Jesus was left with the woman and asked her, "Where are they, "woman, "where are your accusers? "Where are they? "Where are your accusers? "Where are they? "All those who have spat at you? "Where are they? Truth will set us free. Only the truth will set us free, said Christ rebelliously. Then Christ went with them to a place called Gethsemane and he said to his disciples, "Stay here with me, "while I pray." And he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to his disciples, "My soul "is overwhelmed with sorrow "to the point of death. "Stay here "and keep watch with me." He went a little farther and fell with his face to the ground, and prayed, "Father, "if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me." Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. And he said, "The spirit is willing, "but the flesh "is weak." "I am the Alpha and the Omega, "the First and the Last, "the Beginning and the End. "To the thirsty, "I will give from the spring "of the water of life. "This will be the victor's share." Shuafat. "I will be his God, "and he will be My son. "But to the cowardly, "the unbelieving, "the vile, "the degenerate, the murderers "the immoral, the sorcerers, the idolaters, "and all liars, "their fate is in the fiery lake of burning sulphur. "This is the second death." And he showed the holy city, Jerusalem. See, we're here. When Flaubert was 29, he came from Beirut on horseback, with his best friend Maxime Du Camp. Look. Listen to this. This is a letter he sent. It was 150 years ago. "Our journey from Beirut to Jerusalem lasted 9 days. "We spend the night in caravanserais". They're inns. "Or under the stars. Under trees. "We have 4 mules "whose bells we keep hearing all day long as we move forward. "This is the Orient and the true journey." They'd always dreamed of doing this. "I relish the sky, the stones, the sea, the ruins. "Because of the mosquitoes, the horses "and the idea that I must see Jerusalem on the next day "I stayed up all night. "Thursday the 8th. "I expect to see Jerusalem at any time and I don't. "It's a dreadful road "and we can't sit the trot. "I'm moving forward for a while. "Some Arabs wave at me to hurry up and scream at me Al-Quds, Al-Quds" It means "The Holy One", The "Holy City". "3 minutes later, Jerusalem. "It did feel strange. "I pulled my horse to a stop. "I looked at the Holy City. "How clean it is! "The walls are well-preserved. "I thought about Christ "and the sweat trickling down his temples. "He was going to the Mount of Olives, "exiting through the door in front of me, "with mountains... "Mount Hebron in the background..." Remember the mountains we saw? "to my right, in a hazy transparency. "All the rest is dry, hard, grey. "The light makes it feel like winter because it's so white. "And yet it's a warm atmosphere, "which I can't explain. "Max catches up with me, with his luggage. He was smoking. "We go through Jaffa Gate "and I fart quite accidentally, "as we cross the threshold. "I was even upset with my anus' Voltairianism. "Stayed at a hotel. Went to bed early. "Friday the 9th. Walked around the city. "The butcher's. An Armenian convent. Pontius Pilate's house. "A seraglio with a view on the Mosque of Omar. "Jerusalem feels like a fortified mass grave, "where old religions are silently rotting. "You're walking on turds. All you can see is ruins "It's overwhelmingly sad. "The curse of God seems to be upon the holy city, "the city of three religions". Be careful anyway. "11th August, 1850. Jerusalem. "We've been in Jerusalem for 3 days. "I haven't felt any of the emotions I'd expected. "Neither religious enthusiasm, nor imaginative excitement, "nor hate of priests, "which at least would be something. "Whatever I'm facing, I feel emptier than an barrel. "This morning, in the Holy Sepulcher..." Remember? That's what we saw this morning. "a dog would have been more moved than me. "Who's to blame? Them? "Or me? "How fake this all is. "What liars they are! How deceptive! "It's meant for exploitation, propaganda and peddling!" Peddling is what the souvenir sellers we saw everywhere do. Central Station. It's okay. "What then really struck me..." This is something you noticed. "... is the division within churches. "The Greeks, the Latin, the Copts "all keeping to themselves. "Above all, they hate their neighbors. "It's the gathering of mutual curses, and I was filled with such irony "that I left without thinking of anything else. "And then, "we're harassed by holiness. "I'm fed up with it and I can't stand the sight of rosaries. "We did our utmost to make the holy places ridiculous. "We did see hypocrisy, greed, "falsification, impudence. "But no fucking trace of holiness! "I blame them for not being moved. "I'd have been delighted to be moved." He's writing to his friends in Paris. He feels nothing. He believes everything's fake. "On the next day, we woke up at 6. "There was an old Jew keeping to himself. "His head was covered with a white cloth and he was barefoot. "He was intoning from a book. "with his back to the wall, "prancing around on his heels. "From there, we went to a café to smoke shisha. That's the same as in Paris. "Friday the 23rd. "As we leave Jerusalem, the city fades away in the olive woods by the Tombs of the Kings "and looking north, her walls jut out through the foliage. "I thought I'd see her again and bid her farewell. "But a little hill hid it from view. "And when I turned around, "it had totally vanished." Come on, hurry up. Sit down, my son. Thank you. Thank you very much. Sit down, my son. Come here. - Look at me. - Okay. I'll tell you a story. Have some. Want some? It's healthy. It's full of vitamins. No, I'm an old bachelor. I'm not married... An old bachelor? How old are you? How old is he? He looks like he's in his twenties. 24 years old. He's 24 and he thinks he's old? So you're dead! You're totally dead. He says we should go to Amuka. Amuka is in Galilee. In Galilee, on Uzziel's tomb. Near Safed. There's no need to bow down, but if you go there, they send you a young woman. What? What are you saying? At the Wailing Wall? You don't have to go as far as Galilee. You can, 14 days in a row... 40? My God. You have to go to the Wall for 40 days, and talk to the Wall. - 40 days? - Yes. - Talk to the Wall. - What do I tell the Wall? You must learn to talk to walls, that's what marriage is about. Yes. This wall will talk back to you. All kidding aside, my son knows what he's talking about. Go there for 40 days in a row and they'll send you a young woman. - What is your type? - Thing is, I found one. - She wasn't Jewish. - My God, a shiksa. So I asked her to convert. - She didn't agree? - Yes, she converted. And you left her? Yes, she became very religious. She told me I wasn't Jewish enough. Not enough Jewish? What do you mean? Oh, more religious! Observing Shabbat. City Hall. Know who I met here? Aaron Goldman's mother. Remember him? The little boy with a squint. He went to school with a key around his neck like an abandoned dog. Why? Because his mother would take naps. He'd heat his food in the microwave on his own, although it's poisonous and it kills vitamins. Know what became of him? Aaron is a neurosurgeon. He's married with 2 lovely daughters and he sits on the synagogue's board. Know how such a thing is possible? I did my very best, I'd wait for you and cook for you. I'd iron your shirts, I stayed up all night, I never took naps. How come my son's divorced? From a goy girlfriend? And still childless? Aaron's mother's so happy she's swaggering and showing off her her granddaughters' pictures. She's proud as a peacock. What about me? Can't I be happy? When will you stop being selfish? And get married? When will you give me a grandchild? I'm not getting any younger. I'm asking you. I'll be dead soon. Mom, why do you keep talking about death? - I talk about death? - All the time. Get married before you die. Who? Me? What are you talking about? You speak nonsense. You speak nonsense. You speak nonsense. I'm too old, that's enough. At my age... Where would I find someone? Who? An old fool? Who? My God, what are you... No, I don't want to. I'm good like this. When you're by yourself, your soul is at peace. Hey, what are you reading? The Torah says, "Study as you travel". - The traveler's prayer? - No. It is said to study while traveling. - What is it? - We study even when we travel. What are you studying? The Torah says, "Study as you travel". When you travel, you can also study. You can look around. Yes, but you can also do meditation. Obviously, you need to look at the Maker's wonders. You may study at the yeshiva. Look outside, it's beautiful. Jerusalem. I know Jerusalem, one of the Maker's wonders. But you need to celebrate... I see. - The power of the Torah. - All the time. "You shall meditate day and night." - You shall meditate day and night. - Yes. The tram will be here shortly. What's wrong, honey? Why are you crying? Crying? You're kidding? I never cry. Show me your eyes. Why would I cry? Girls cry when their boyfriends leave. Weird, isn't it? I'm glad you're not crying. I'm trying hard. Don't cry when the tram leaves. - I won't. - Promised? Why? What? Why? - You want me to cry? - I don't. It's enough that you love me. Isn't it? Of course it is. You love me, don't you? I do. Really? Really. - Is the tram coming? - That's what it says here. - Keep going out. - I'll be okay. I mean it. Don't wait for my calls. I'm not that type of a person. - I asked Motti to take care of you. - I've already asked him. He has a new car. Does he? - You can go for rides. - That's what we plan to do. I've also invited Tomer. Do you know him? He's a bit of a DJ, a tall guy. You know who it is. Yes. Have fun. That's what I'll do. I have to go. Good luck. Don't miss the tram. Good luck. Your attention, please. We should be moving shortly Sorry for the inconvenience. My God, who is it? Don't come near me. Stop. I stopped. Don't come near me or I'll scream. I'm not moving. What are you doing here? What do you mean? They're palm branches. Do you mind? You look like the guy in the papers. What are you doing here? I'm going home after work as I do everyday. - Don't come near me. - I'm not coming, calm down! - Don't move! - I'm not moving! I'll call the police. If you move, I'll scream. Ma'am, you don't have to yell, you can see I'm not moving. I just want to put down my bag. It's heavy. Are you a thief? A terrorist? Do I look like a thief? - You're a rapist. - Yes, of course. I ride the tram and I rape women. That's what I do. - Don't move. - I'm not moving. - What's your accent? - What do you think? - Arabic. - True. Well done. You're an Arab. He's an Arab! - Everything okay? - Have you seen his face? - Yes, I... - Your ID. - Everything's fine. - Your ID. The palm leaves are for a friend. For the 3rd time, your ID. Understand what I'm telling you? Your ID. Give it to me. Now. Leave me alone, I won't give it to you. - Give it to me. - I won't. Let go of me. Send me someone for number 45, please. Not everyone has this problem. But I do. I can't say no. When I began working for Jews, I'd keep saying "Inshallah". As if it was the most polite way to address a boss. But it meant, "I don't want to". Jews believe "Inshallah" means "yes", whereas it actually means "no". Like, when an Arab tells you, "Inshallah, I'll come by at 5 to fix your sink". It means he doesn't want to. "Look for someone else." Because I'd said "Inshallah", I ended up doing the dishes. I dropped out of college, I quit studying, I became the gigolo of the lady who owned the restaurant. She was over 60, no kidding. She'd tell me, "Let's meet at the warehouse?" And I'd go, "Inshallah." You really can't bring yourself to say... "no" to people? Mostly to Jews. But I've changed. Now I say, "I'm not sure I want to." With this, it seems like you... As I didn't have any paper to print my pictures and as I didn't want my parents or anyone to help me, I decided to find a job. I met with the editor of a local paper. I brought along my portfolio, my notebooks, my camera. and I came into his office. "You looking for a photographer?" "Are you an Arab?" "I am." "Can you read and write?" "Of course." "I need someone to write articles on the Arab zone". "What do you think?" And you said, "I'm not sure I want to"? Yes. And because "I'm not sure I want to" was mistaken, I ended up in Gaza, with a heavy heart, in Jenin, in Nablus, in front of starving children, dodging sniper fire on both sides, on the front line, interviewing wanted men and settlers. After the war, it was more fun but it didn't make sense. I began interviewing models. Eran Sabag? Yes? Your show is really nice. Thanks. - Do you watch it? - Of course. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. What will you talk about tonight? I believe that tonight... Today is the date of Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party. It's a historic date, so I guess I'll devote the show to him in as much detail as possible. This man was a saint. Do you know who Leon Trotsky was? Trotsky is the most important revolutionary of contemporary Jewish history. He's behind the idea of permanent revolution. As long as the world isn't a better place as long as socialism hasn't taken over, the revolution will carry on. And the more we're getting near its end, the more we move away from it. Like the horizon. He was the main opponent of Stalin, who destroyed the dream of equality, liberty, fraternity, who hunted him down in Mexico City to kill him, and he became the martyr of socialism. I think I'll devote my show to him tonight. Can I read you something he wrote? Naturally. You'll tell me what you think. He wrote this in 1917, at the outbreak of the revolution. And it goes, "Under the conditions of disintegrating capitalism, "the masses continue to live the dismal life of the oppressed "threatened now more than ever "with the danger of being cast "into the pit of pauperism." In other words, absolute poverty. "They must defend their mouthful of bread, "if they cannot increase or better it. "But 2 basic economic afflictions, "in which is summarized the increasing absurdity of capitalism, "that is, unemployment and high prices, "call for generalized slogans and methods of struggle. "We declare an all-out war "on the politics of the capitalists "who place on workers "the burden of militarism, "the crisis, "and all other scourges stemming from capitalism's agony. "We demand employment "and decent living conditions for all. "It's about guarding the proletariat "from decay, demoralization and ruin. "It's a question of life or death "on the only creative and progressive class "and by that token of mankind's future. "If capitalism is incapable "of meeting the demands "inevitably arising "from the calamities generated by itself, "then let it perish! "And if the bourgeois... "And if the bourgeois were to try to take over the sun, "we shall extinguish the sun." - What do you think? - It's moving. - It's awesome, isn't it? - Definitely. You've helped me nail the show's topic. Thanks. I'm Palestinian with a Dutch passport. I'm... Russian, Polish, German, Israeli and Jewish, naturally. Piling up identities is the latest Palestinian syndrome. I thought it was a Jewish strategy. To be honest, I've never lived in Holland. I have a Dutch passport, that's it. Is your husband Dutch? I got married and divorced. For citizenship? No. For love. I then worked for an international organization. And... you figured that love and work don't mix. I figured that work and marriage don't mix. That's a nomad's life... One day here, another day there... Yes. We've all become Bedouins. One day, he told me how much I'd put him through. And it was over. A demanding job can make you very selfish. It's even worse for women! You know, I sometimes feel like I don't belong anywhere. It's weird. I'm like you, I don't like getting too close to people. Only from time to time. Your ID, please. Say something in Dutch. I don't speak Dutch, but I have a Dutch passport. I'm Palestinian with a Dutch passport. What are you exactly? What do you mean, "exactly"? What is your nationality? Palestinians have lived here for centuries. Is this good enough? I don't get it. Can't you just answer my question? She means that her national identity is abstract. But you're asking for a concrete representation that... Please show me your ID, too. Where are you going? I'm going to Damascus Gate. Why all the questions? Don't you like the Old City? It's beautiful. It's touristy. - I'm the one asking the questions. - Of course. Considering what our country's coming to, I wonder what 2 women like you do together. Know what? This isn't political. Yes, we... ride the same tram. Nothing symbolic. Have a good trip. Didn't you want to see me? - What are you doing here? - I wanted to see you. It's over, you won't hear from me again. - I want to keep in touch. - I don't. It was just a sex thing. I'm not interested. Having sex with you makes me sick. You want to punish me? No. Leave me alone. They say you can't be trusted, that you're a piece of shit. Is this what you think? What difference does it make? Do you hate me? Not even close. What I loved about you, was your smell. Leave me be, it's enough. You were born miserable You've moved up in the world, and become a teacher You've used rifles, you've used tanks You've stolen lands and became a doctor Life's a bitch, I've lived in a cave But on our land, there are only stones We'll return the land, We'll return the house Your bullets don't scare us, But they spur us on How strong are you without a gun? You change the rules You steal a culture But our culture grows within us How could you change what's within us? Check what's on the roofs Go. Why are you surprised? Palestine isn't a land, Palestine lives within us Go. Why are you surprised? Palestine isn't a land, Palestine lives within us Go, go, go Who are you, crazy Israeli? Holding a gun and shooting We're an occupied country He somehow eased the tensions He's obviously tired of killing and forbidding He's thinking of a solution Who are you? Again, who are you? Are you with the police or the border patrol? I don't know what to do, he looks confused Tell him about his gun and he'll say "cool" He uses it a lot and can't give it up It's as dear to him as his father He loves it and carries it with him His gun never leaves his pocket He's sad if he doesn't pull it out He loves it so much that he can't give it up He says he can rule with his gun No, my friend, we'll liberate Jerusalem with our blood Go. Why are you surprised? Palestine isn't a land, Palestine lives within us Go. Why are you surprised? Palestine isn't a land, Palestine lives within us Go, go, go You're not making it easy on me, Didi. We're going in different directions. I'd like to know which direction you're heading. Do you want a divorce? Tell me something I don't know. You're not making it easy, your constant hostility ruins my appetite. Come on, say it. - Say what? - Speak out, Moshe. You wanted to talk, didn't you? So here we go. Let's talk. I know about your infertility. I personally did some tests What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? What are you talking about? - Why are you getting worked up? - You're depressing me. Honestly. I'm sorry. What's this about, all of a sudden? What's wrong with you? I hate having arguments on the bus. - We're on a tram. - On the tram, too. Why are you shouting? What's wrong with you? Kids are a big deal. If we adopt, you have to get involved. Can you calm down? What's this bullshit about? Fine. Who planted this adoption idea in your head? Is it my mother? Can you picture us with a kid? We barely know what to do with ourselves. There must be a reason for all this. As far as I go, it's fine as it is. What's the reason? Tell me. We're going different ways. We're different. Shoafat. I won't raise kids in this country. You're changing the subject! Now you're blaming the country. I hate conversations. They're unpleasant. They're depressing. I don't want kids, period. I really don't. I won't raise kids in this crazy world, in this crazy country where things can go out of hand in no time. Please, don't lecture me on politics! Want to go to Eilat? Eilat? - Come on, come with me. - What's the matter with you? It'll be a change for us... It'll do us some good. Just the two of us? I can ask my father to join us. We'll be with people we love. Come on! Is this your idea? Of course. You want my mother to join us, too? You want to split up? That's not what I said. Did you see him again? Who? You know damn well who I mean, you bitch. I can't believe you bring this up. You disgust me with your scenes. - I can't get over it. - I want to get off. I was looking for you during the war and you were fucking my best friend. I thought you'd been hit by a missile and... It was 5 years ago. We talked about it. I was honest with you. Why go over this again? You had sex with him. Yes! Aren't you ashamed? How could you? I want out. I want to get off. You whore. Beit Hanina. Your country is really fantastic. What can we do, Mister... Mister Chelsea. Azoulay. What can we do? We are a small and fantastic people. Simply small and fantastic people. What do you say, Alexander? I say that there is nothing we can do. You're absolutely right. We are a small and fantastic people. A small and fantastic people, that's what we are. A small and fantastic people. Yes, fantastic. The sun is fantastic. It's true that the sun is fantastic, but it's not our only force, Mister Chelsea. What do you say, Alexander? I say that the sun is really the sun but we also know how to fight at night. The sun is really the sun, but we also know how to fight at night. At night or in the day. This is my son. But it's so beautiful. It's true, but at night or in the day... We are so fantastic that we are ready at any moment, any time. I know but it's... You know, we cannot go out... We know that if we go out, we cannot come back without a victory because we have no choice but to be victorious, you understand? But it's certainly the weather. The sun, the light is incredible. And your sea. It's a very sensitive point because our navy, it's a small unit, very small, but brave. It's a brave unit. What do you say, Alexander? What do I say? I say that the airforce is in the air, the navy is in the sea, and the parachuters are in the parachutes. Each unit in its function. And the infantry is for the infantrymen. Each unit in its function. And you know... You know our navy, it's the only navy in the whole world in which the submarine commander sinks with the sailors. And what does he do after? He resurfaces with them. In other words, the... the fantastic human quality makes up for the lack of quantity. It's the only army in which the commander, the officer goes before the private, and the cook eats before the soldiers. Just to come back to... to your weather, and the beauty of the sand and the sea. Forgive me, Mister... Mister Chelsea, but what do you have against our army? Nothing. It's certainly thanks to the sun... It's his first time, and it won't be the last. Thank you. Come on. We're getting off here. There is a weeping in the world As if the dear Lord had died And the leaden shadow that falls Weighs heavy as a grave Come, Let's huddle close together Life lies in all hearts As in coffins You... Give me a deep... You... Come, let's kiss deeply At home I have a blue piano But I can't play a note It's been in the dark of the cellar, ever since the world went rotten Four hands Four starry hands played harmonies The Woman in the Moon sang in her boat Now only rats dance to the clanks The keyboard is in bits I weep for what is blue. Is dead Sweet angels, push open I've eaten bitter bread Push open the gates of heaven While I am still alive When we look at each other Our eyes blossom and we're astounded by our own miracles When we look at each other Our eyes blossom and we're astounded by our miracles Isn't that right? We're framed by stars And we take flight from the world I believe we are angels When we look at each other Our eyes blossom and we're astounded by our miracles Isn't that right? We're framed by stars And we take flight from the world I believe we are angels Armageddon The giants of stone are back burning down the country They return it to what it was A desolate land A desert
