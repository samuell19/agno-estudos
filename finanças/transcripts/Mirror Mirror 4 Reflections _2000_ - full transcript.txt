(mysterious music) (distant whispering) (eerie music) (watch ticking) (gate clattering) - Do you have to be so loud? You know, I don't think this is such a good idea. - You are always such a chicken. - I think it's called breaking and entering. My dad was a cop, remember? - Okay, how can it be breaking in if I'm the prop guy here, okay? Besides I need a costume for tomorrow. - Well, what's wrong with a costume store? - Where's your sense of adventure? (Annika gasps) ♪ Hi ho hi ho hi ho ♪ ♪ There in the city ♪ ♪ There was an old bittie ♪ ♪ Hi ho hi ho hi ♪ (Mabel groans) - That's a beastly mess. Like I've got no better round to do. (both laugh) - How cute. (cat meows) (Annika screams) Damn it, Ian, I told you I didn't want to come here. - How can you blame that on me? - Okay, tell me why we didn't use the front door. Okay, wait, wait, wait. What's that noise? - [Mabel] Mabel, get that storage room cleaned out today! - Oh, it's just the crazy cleaning lady. - Great, witnesses. - She won't even remember that we're here, okay? I promise. Come on, I have a surprise for you. - I'm missing my freaking chat show. Damn wanker. I deserve hazard pay for missing my chat show, I do. What's this? It's a lovely old mirror. Oh, you're too beauteous a gabber to be covered up. You just need someone to love you. Oh, Aunt Mabel's here. We'll get you out of here. Oh, mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all? (Mabel laughs) (Annika gasps) - Damn it. Ian, can we go? - [Ian] Here it is. - You're going as a maitre-d? - [Ian] No. - What then, a mortician? - [Ian] You'll see. - Good, well just hurry up, so we can get out of here. (Mabel giggles) - I should have been an actress or a singer. (sings off key) I'm just a party girl is all. - I have something for you too. Now close your eyes. - You've got to be kidding. - Just do it for me, please? - All right, and then we're done, right? - I promise. - Okay. I'm ready. I'm counting to three. One, two- - Ta da! - Oh my god. It's so beautiful. - You like it? I'm not leaving until you try this on. Then I promise we can go. - [Annika] Ian! - Please. Okay. - I feel so alive. Oh, you must be heaven to have me feeling like this. You've got some magic in ya, just like me. Youth is wasted on the little ones. If only we could make time stand still or turn back, so I'd always be feeling just like I am at this moment. - Look what I found in my pocket. You look beautiful. Oh. (Ian gags) - [Annika] What's wrong? - I don't feel so good. - Must have been my mother's pot roast again, I'm so sorry. - Something worse than that. - Oh my god. Oh my god, are you okay? Ian? - Mirror mirror standing still, work your magic, if you will. - What's wrong? - I think it's terminal. I feel sort of... love sick. - You brat! I'm so sick of your stupid jokes. You know, you had me scared. - I'm scared too, Annika, I am. - What's that supposed to mean? - Before I lose my nerve, I wanted to ask you to be my wife. - Just stop with the jokes, Ian. It's not funny. - Could I? Because I'm not joking. Is that a no kind of a cry or is that a yes kind of a cry? (Annika cries) (eerie music) - Oh come on, pretty gabber. Work your magic, my angel mirror. (Mabel screams) - Did you hear that? - Yeah, I did. - Come on, let's get out of here. - No, I can't just go. I have to see what it is first. - We can call the police! Ian, I don't want anything to happen to you. - Sweetie, I am the happiest man in the world right now, okay? Nothing's going to happen to me. I promise. (thunder rumbles) Hey, if you kids have broken in here again you better go out the same way you came! Don't want me to catch you. - Wait, wait, look, look, look, look. What's that? I get it! You're just trying to... It's one of your stupid jokes, isn't it? One of these stupid props from the theater? - Honey, honey, honey. Honey, honey, honey. - Oh, come on. You're not gonna scare me. - That's not a prop! (Annika screams) (growling) Hurry, Ian, hurry! - I got it, I got it. - Ian! - Go, go, go! (Annika breathes heavily) (door clatters) - Ian! (thunder crashes) - Annika! (watch ticking) Come on! - Hey, sweetie. You should eat something. You are not looking at that photo album again. Oh, Annika. You need to move on with your life. - I've been in love with Ian my whole life. I wish it was me instead of him. - [Mother] If you keep living in the past like this, it will destroy you. You haven't been out of this house in over a year. - I just don't want to talk about it. - You know, you're not even trying to get better, Annika. - Oh, I'm not trying? - No, you're not trying at all! - You want me to go out? Fine. Will that make everything okay? - [Mother] No, it won't. But, it is a first step. - As a matter of fact, there's a party at the old theater complex tonight. - The place where it happened? - Yeah, maybe that'll make you believe I'm trying. (thunder rumbles) (watch ticking) (rock music plays distantly) - People, people. Okay, it's after five o'clock. It's only a few hours before the mob gets here. Let's get going, huh? What do you- Whoo! Mel, I am trying to work here. - That is not what you said last night. - I know that. Chad here. - [Countess] Chad, my good boy. How's the installation of my madness maze coming? - Great. Everything looks so real. - [Countess] That's because it is. - The only problem is, I was expecting you to be here with it. - [Countess] I know I promised you, but I've been working on a new exhibit for Halloween for tomorrow night. I'll be over tonight to pick up our two clothes. We'll meet there. - All right, I'll be waiting. - [Countess] Until then, have an absolutely horrifying time. - Who was that? - The Countess. - Oh, again? I think she's just a figment of your Rumple-foreskin's imagination. - Okay, what kind of a word is that? - I made it up. Isn't it cute? - Actually, no. It's disgusting. - I've decided to make up an entirely new language. For example, the hurricane that's coming, I'm calling it sky juice. - So, a hurricane really is coming, though it doesn't really matter. I already have their money. - Oh, really? How much? - 50 grand. - What are you gonna do with all that money? - Harvard tuition. My dad cut me off. I busted the Bentley. - Again? - Come on, let's get ready. - Just wait until you see my outfit. I'm gonna be Hot Spice. - I'll get the stuff from the car. (thunder crashes) (electronic music) (crowd roars) - That is a great outfit, but didn't they fire Skanky Spice? (Melissa laughs) - Oh. - I don't think you'd be laughing if you knew who I was. - Think 17th century England. - [Jack] I killed many a lass. - Thank you. - Jack... what's his name? - [Jack] The ripper! - Ripper rhymes with zipper. Something you obviously haven't mastered yet. - What does that mean? - I see birthday candles on your birthday cake. Did your mommy give you those for your birthday? Actual size representation? - Maybe you'll get a better look in private. - I bet you're too hot to handle with that little candle. - Yeah, get back, Jack. - [Jack] What are you, some kind of rhyming hunchback? - Yeah, can I get in here? Okay, great, thanks. - Me too, excuse me. - So, where's Chad? - He's upstairs in the Madness Maze. - [Girl] Remember the girl from Taft, the one whose boyfriend got murdered last year? - Oh, yeah. What was her name? It was Anne or Anna or something. - Annika. - What a strange name. - She's such a strange girl. No one's seen her in the past year. So, we're on our way to cruise the place some. You want to come? - Actually, no. Chad's giving me a preview of the Madness Maze, sorry. - Okay. See you later. We're gonna go to the rave. - Bye, ladies. - Bye! - I should never have come. Oh, oh my god. Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Oh my god, I'm so sorry. - I love taking showers at a party. - I'm so sorry. - So do I. How about you? Would you like to take a shower, little flower? - Don't mind him. He's got a horrible rhyming disease he caught from Raunchy Spice. - So, where are you going? I just saw you down at the bar. - I'm not exactly having a good time. - Well, we can help you out with that, if you like. - I have to go. - Hey, where are you going? Hey, looks like she's going to men's room. Want to follow her? - Sure. - Okay, let's go. (lightning crashes) (distant whispering) - I wanted you to see this before anyone got here. Are you ready? - A freaky place. - Wait 'til you come inside. - It's a little scary how into all this stuff you are. - And, what is that supposed to mean? Everything that you see here comes from a traveling show called the Madness Maze. All the artifacts that you see here are freaking real. They're either from an actual murder or somebody who was murdered, and they're all centered around paranormal madness. The stories are the answer. (Melissa giggles) Come to me. Stay close or I'll grab ya! (both laugh) Hello, what's over here? (Chad growls) (Melissa laughs) This is the killer bride. Her lover was killed on the night of their wedding. She seeked out the murderer, killed him, and then she killed herself. - [Melissa] No guy is worth that. - That's not what you said last night. The clown killers burned their victims in grotesque fashions. Their crimes were considered the most hideous of their time. (Melissa laughs) You wouldn't take this so lightly if you saw how they mutilated their victims. The scary thing is that their victims were alive the whole time. - Oh, that is so sick. - You can still hear their screams. (distant screaming) Louder, louder! - Cut it out! (both laugh) - Come on. It's just a clown. It's not gonna jump out and get you. This was the clown that did all the murders. (Melissa screams) You are so gullible. - You creep! - Baby, it's just a gag. Don't worry about it. (Annika breathes heavily) So, what do you think? It's an animatronic clown. - Well, considering I am way too young to have a heart attack I'd say it works. - Not sure. (ominous music) - So, you haven't told me how pretty I look yet. - Well, you always look pretty, Melissa. Do I really need to tell you that every time I see you? - Only if you want to make love to me. (Chad clears throat) - You look pretty. Very, very pretty. - I think being scared agrees with me. - Boo. (thunder crashes) (distant laughter) - [Annika] Is anyone there? - [Announcer] You sir, are found guilty of witch craft and condemned to death. - This place is beautiful. It says here that sacrifice keeps away the "baka," people who can shape shift into animal form and seek victims to devour. - Stop it, man. You're making me hungry. (eerie growling) Okay, let's get out of here. - [Woman] Help me, help me. I don't want to die. Please help. Please open. - Come on, this is all fake. Such a girly man. Oh my god. It's a tape recorder. - That's not cool, fool. (distant thudding) - Ian. Hey you, stop! - Oh, great. No one's supposed to be up here. - Wait a minute, I wasn't finished. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll make it up to you later. Yo, babe! - Hey wait up, quick draw. - [Chad] You're gonna get thrown out of here! - I think I hear a guy's voice. We better get out of here before we get caught. - [Annika] Why aren't you listening to me? - Or not. - Damn, preppy. Damn, Wonder thing-y. - [Chad] Come back here! - [Melissa] Chad! (woman cries distantly) - Hey you! Whoever you are, stop messing with me! - [Melissa] Chad! Chad! - Things are looking up. Sounds like the bitch from the bar. Let's go get her. - [Chad] Damn it, where is she? (woman screams) - Chad? Chad! - Surprise. - Who the hell do you think you are? This is my boyfriend's party. You're lucky if he doesn't throw your ass out of here. - Where is he now? - Hey, monster man, move! - I thought you liked me, little sweet pea. - Yeah, I like oysters too, and they're slimy, just like you. How do you like that rhyme, giant slime? How's this for a surprise, asshole? (thunder rumbles) - Where are you? Come on, where are you? (eerie music) Is anyone there? Oh my god. This is the room where that woman... (distant whispering) I love you so much. - I love you too. How long is your mother away for? - Two days. - Two days. - Yeah. - That's not nearly long enough. - I know. When was the first moment you knew you loved me? - You know, I think it was when I first saw you smile. - Really? - Yeah. I'm a sucker for all those capped teeth. (Annika laughs) - I don't have capped teeth. - What do you mean? Nobody's teeth are that perfect at all. - Hey, you! You're not supposed to be in here. Listen, I didn't mean to scare you, but what are you doing in the labyrinth? - What? - [Chad] I heard you talking to somebody in the labyrinth. Is someone else here with you? - No. I mean, yes. - Who? - I was following him back here. - Chad! - [Joey] We're gonna get you! (lightning crashes) - Oh, this is just perfect. I was just attacked, and you're I here helping gidget. - You know, it's just like you to think that. This is the girl that I followed into the labyrinth. And, what do you mean attacked? - Attacked, attacked. How many ways can someone mean attacked? Are you deaf? Them! Those are the guys. Do something. - Hey man, your girlfriend's a real bitch. I couldn't help myself. - It's true. She's really mean. - Just calm down. - Calm down? Is that all you're gonna say? - What the hell is that? - Maybe it's the hurricane. (electric buzzing) (watch ticking) (phone rings) - [Mother] Hello? Yes, it is. Well, what is it? That can't be. I'll be right there. (Annika's mother cries) - Mom. I'm here. Please don't cry. I'm okay. (dramatic music) - Oh, Annika. I will always love you. (thunder rumbles) - [Jack] Where am I? - [Joey] I think we're dead. - [Melissa] Shut up, you idiots. - [Jack] Oh no, we're in hell. - Does anybody have a lighter? I can't see a thing. Are you okay? There was some sort of hurricane or electrocution or something. - Yeah, we got our asses electrocuted. - What about the girl? - What about me? - Well obviously I can tell that you're all right. - See, girls like you don't die. They live to irritate everyone else into killing. - Shut up, Jack the Hack! - That's a good one. - Maybe she's dead. - I can hear her heartbeat. - I think she's lost it. Hey, hey, snap out of it! All right, I did my good deed for the day, and now I'm getting out of here. - You're not going anywhere! We're all going together, all of us. Let's put her over there on the couch. - Here. - What? - I'm feeling tired. Could I lay down on the couch with her? - No. I don't think it's serious, but I'm gonna call an ambulance. You guys, get her over there. Why don't you stay with her until we get some help? - Fabu-mundo. (thunder crashes) - Damn, cell phones! Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. I remember I saw some lanterns in this room. Give me a hand. - Leave us one! Don't leave us here too long. This place gives me the creeps! (gate clatters) - Of course it still doesn't work. - You know, it could be the power's out, preppy. - You know what? Don't start with your crap right now, buddy. I'm sure that's really helping. Why don't we try the stairs, joker? - Joker with the broken poker. (thunder rumbles) - She is so boring. I am hot. I'm talking to you. Oh, yeah. You're so bad. (eerie rumbling) Screw this! - [Annika] Ian! - Annika, come on! - [Annika] I can't get the door open! - Come on, let's go. (Ian breathes heavily) (Annika cries) - Ian! (Annika screams) Ian, hurry! Hurry, come on! Ian! Ian! (Annika screams) - Easy. (Frederick shushes) I'm not trying to hurt you. I'm trying to help you. Have a sip of this. (Annika coughs) - Oh my god. I don't hear anybody upstairs. I bet you they all left. What a drag for you, man. Here, let me try. - Oh, great. You took off the door knob. What a super asshole. - Maybe we're not supposed to leave. - I wonder which one of you jokers will go first. (thunder crashes) - But, do you feel more alive? - My head is pounding. What are you doing here? - I live here. - You live here? Where? - Here. Mostly when the weather's bad. - My name's Annika. - I'm Frederick. It's an honor to meet you, Annika. You suffered great pain. - I'm feeling much better. - No, no, no, I mean here, inside. It feels like you are hurt. - Yeah. (mysterious music) I thought I saw someone. The last thing I remember... I was looking at that mirror. - That mirror's special. - What does that mean? - I'm sick of looking for you. Where the hell is he? How could he just leave me alone like this? When I get out of here I am going back to musicians. At least you know they're assholes. I guess I'll just go back and see Miss. Personality. - All mirrors are special, really. They have powers. They can heal the lost souls. Come! Come, come, come, come. Look inside. - Inside? - No, I mean inside yourself. The mirror will help you. - This is really creepy. - No, wait, wait. The pain will go away, I promise you, if only for a few moments. All you have to do is stare at yourself in the mirror and make a wish about anything. The mirror will lead you to it. (mysterious music) - Will you always love me? - Of course. Forever. - What does forever really mean? - It means forever. - I know, but a lot of people say forever, but forever's infinite, you know? - Well, that's what I mean. (Annika giggles) I love you. - I definitely love infinite. - Well, what if something were to happen to me? What if I were 90 and I die first? Would you pick up the first 70 year old that came along? I'd pine away for you until there was nothing left. You know, like George Burns did for Gracie, like McCall does for Bogey, like Catherine does for Tracy. - You are so corny. - That's why you love me. - Where am I? - You feel better? - Like I had a great dream. - I know. I can feel it. Everyone has a need for hope. Like finds like. - More like loser finds loser. We're moving to a ghost free location. Who is this, your boyfriend? Why don't you get cleaned up if you want to hang out with us, okay? - All right, all right. You guys go this way. I'm going that way. We meet back here, okay? - Okay. - What are we looking for again? - Anything that'll help us. Tools for the door, jugs of water, some blankets, maybe some flashlights, maybe some lanterns. (thunder crashes) Go! - Who made that guy God? Look, I say we just try to find a way out of here. Screw those guys. - Deal. - Isn't Chad great? He found all those lanterns. They're from a lesbian western. I tried out for it, but I am so not into kissing a girl. - So Frederick, how'd you end up being homeless? - Lost my home when my wife died. I hung on to the house, the furniture, all the beautiful things for a very long time. My love died. Without my love, everything just seemed too painful, so I live here. I can see that you understand. - That is such a sad story. I think the reason that most people are homeless is because they're lazy. - Never know, you might fall in love with somebody... other than yourself. (Melissa laughs) - Is that supposed to be an insult? - So Frederick, why don't you try something on too? (Annika laughs) (thudding) - You know, you really ought to get yourself a little piece of that brunette. - She doesn't like me. - What difference does that make? - What do you mean? - Look, all we got to do is you take her out to a real nice restaurant once, and then we get some girl we know, you know, to slobber all over you. She's putty in your hands. - Sounds like a lot to do. - Or, you could just do what I do. Take it if you want it. (Joey mimics robot sounds) - Fire! - Put that down. - I'm starting to like this place more and more. - You look great! - You look good yourself. Can I ask you something? - It depends on what it is. - Do you feel that if you have enough faith and you believe enough that your dreams can come true? - I used to. - Before your love died? I understand. Next time that you feel that pain, you think about the mirror, you make a wish, and you believe. You can stop that hurting. - What do you think? - It's... it's okay. - What? - Say what you think. I'm a big girl. - Well it's... sleazy. - Sleazy? Do you even know what sleazy is? - I'm sorry, you asked. - What are you? Some kind of disgusting virgin? I bet you never even had a boyfriend. That's it, isn't it? Well, if you think Chad is available, you are quite wrong. (watch ticking) (suspenseful music) Hello? Hey, anybody home? Are you even listening to me? - You insecurities are so loud, it's a little hard to hear you. - Shut up, stinky! Something's itching in my dress. I think there's something crawling on me. - Are you okay? - Something itching. There's something crawling on me. (Melissa screams) Get it off! Get it off! Oh my god. Oh my god, I think I'm gonna be sick. There are thousands of them. There's thousands of them! There's thousands of them! (Melissa screams) (thunder crashes) - Dude, look at this! It's some sort of an emergency kit, but it's stuck. (lock clicks) Oh, yeah. - Jackpot. - Do you think there's any of that freeze dried astronaut ice cream? - I don't think so. (distant rumbling) - Stupid tape recorder. Auto-rewind. Okay, this is scary. I'm getting the hell out of here. I don't know that how that happened. I don't want to know how that happened. - Cool. Maybe we can hear about the hurricane on this thing. - This'll come in handy. - That's bad. (Jack screams) - What was that? - Probably somebody else being attacked by bugs off of... What's his name? - Frederick. - Oh, perfect. I'll call you Freddy. You're creepy enough. - Why don't you just have another drink? - What happened to you? - He had an accident. - If you don't get this thing out of my hand right now I'm gonna be very very angry. Who the hell is he? - Frederick. You should call him icky for short. - Do you always have to be so mean? - Yes, little Miss. Virgin. It's my destiny. - Here, fix him! Hope these bandages are still good. - I'll fix him if you shut up. - Give me that. - Hey, I was traumatized too. - Yeah, she had maggots crawling all over her. - Too bad I wasn't here for that. - Maggots? Is that all? - No, Jack-o, that's not all. I've been attacked, electrocuted, and worm-ified, and the night is still young, so what the hell? - That's because life never turns out to be the plans you made. It's always moving backward, forward. It all depends on your point of view. - [Joey] That's really trippy. - It was just here! I cannot believe this. This is stupid. All right, something must have changed. I cannot have gotten lost in my own labyrinth. What the hell is that? (eerie music) - My turn! - Why don't you put that thing where it can do some good? - Shut up! You just shut up before I put that nail back in. - Hey, flashlight. Okay, nail boy. I hope it didn't hurt when I pulled it out. What's your name? - Believe it or not, it's Jack. - Perfect, type casting. - Aren't you gonna ask me my name? - No! - It's Joey. Say, what about you? - I'm Annika. - Annika? I heard about you. - [Newscaster] It's 11:38 on KGGB radio. The winds are up to 110 miles an hour in the Warehouse District. Everyone's been evacuated. If you can't get out of your residence, contact the nearest police station. - Great, everyone's evacuated but us. - Hey, my watch is going backwards. - Shut up! Where is Chad? - Looking for supplies. - Let's go find him. - Not until you finish nursing me back to health. Ow! (thunder crashes) - What's wrong, Annika? - Oh, nothing. Nothing anybody can help me with. - You'd be surprised how much good a little conversation can do. In fact, sometimes talking's the only thing that'll help. A little listening doesn't hurt, and I'm very good listener. - Sometimes we never recover. That's just the way it is. Maybe I could of- - No, no, no. Just imagine death is a dream. You wake up, life begins. - Those guys are creeping me out. I say we go find Chad and leave Dr. Homeless and Miss. Lovelorn. - I guess it's time for me to use my trusty ax on that door. Ready? - Looks like your friends are getting ready to leave. I'll be back in a minute. I got to go find some shoes that fit. I love shoes. (lightning crashes) - Melissa! Anyone there? Melissa? - Chad! Are you okay? - Mel, Mel. There is something real freaky going on, or that labyrinth is haunted. - Does it have anything to do with maggots or nails? - I have no idea what you're talking about. - Well, I had to take my dress off. - I didn't hear that part. - That's weird. This opened. - Yeah, whatever. I just want to get the hell out of here. - That's weird, my watch says it's 6:30, and look, it's going backwards! - Hello? I said that already about 10 times. - You know, it must have something to do with the electrical shock. Reverse polarity? - My watch says 6:45. - [Melissa] So does that mean if time is going backwards none of this ever happened? - [Joey] The door's stuck! - [Jack] Here, let me try my ax. Here's Johnny! - [Chad] We'll be back to get you. Stay there! - Ian? Ian? Ian? (eerie music) - Do you think it'll be any different making love to a married man? - I wouldn't know. - Well, you will soon. - How soon? - I'd say about three hours and 20 minutes. - Well, I better go get dressed then, shouldn't I? - Well, I actually prefer that a lot better. - You are so bad. - Don't forget corny though, too. - Corny and horny. - Oh yeah? I'm gonna show you how much. - Sorry. I was elected to come get you. I saw you tonight at the bar. You're really hot. I'm not really hunchback, you know. See? Mom's. - Don't do that. - What, I'm not your type? You just want to be friends? I've heard it all before. - It's not that, I just don't want anyone to touch me except... - What? Saving yourself for Froderick? You know, Jack says that when a girl says no what she means is maybe. - I said no! - I don't feel so good. - Too bad. - What's wrong? I feel sick. - Now you know how it feels when you touch me. - That wasn't funny. - Being a woman alone isn't funny either. Being helpless isn't funny, and being touched by you is definitely not funny! Did you ever think that I might be in love with someone else, that I don't let other men touch me like that, that every time you touch me it reminds me of the times he's touched me? - I'm hurting here! - You don't understand what hurting is. Men like you only understand one thing. That thing between your legs. What if it was gone, huh? What would you do then? - What the hell's happening to me? - Just get out! (thunder crashes) - God damn it. I'm gonna nail that bitch if it's the last thing I ever do. Where the hell's the bathroom? Jesus! What the hell are you doing here? I don't think I'm up for this. Damn. You don't happen to have any breath mints, do you? Any breath mints? So, where are we going? (eerie music) I never thought you really liked me that much. (Melissa shushes) Some guys, they're aggressive with women, but I'm not one of 'em. You know, I... I don't usually get the girl. Oh, you're a kinky little cat. Yeah, oh yeah. - I thought you were leaving. - We are as soon as it's safe. Not that I'm scared. I just don't want to die tonight. Where's hunchy? - Yeah, baby! You really know how to... I've never felt anything like this... (Joey moans) Yeah, that's good. Oh yeah, oh yeah. (Joey screams) - What's that sound? - That sounds like him. - He's probably just messing with us. Did you see him upstairs? - No. - Better go check it out. - He's probably just jerking off in the labyrinth again. (ominous music) - [Chad] When I find you, you're out of here, hurricane or not! - [Melissa] Come back, little hunchback! - [Jack] Joey, where are you man? Stop screwing around. I think the noise is coming from the Salem room. Oh my god. It looks like blood. - There's nothing in there. Must be a joke. - Well, we heard something. Where is he? - [Chad] I don't know, man. Maybe it was just the tape recorder. - Or not. - Hey. Hey! He came up here to find you. Don't tell me he didn't see you. - Annika. That's it. You're the girl whose boyfriend got killed. Maybe it was the ghost of her dead boyfriend that got your friend. (Melissa laughs) - Very funny. Come on, Annika. What really did happen here? - My past is private, get it? And, frankly I'm glad your friend is gone. He was an asshole. - She's getting ready to go psycho. - [Chad] Knock it off, Jack. - Why, Chad? You know, I'd really like to know what happened. - I let him die, okay? And, if you don't quit messing around with me you'll be next along with your friend! - Hey, let her go. Let her go! Are you crazy? - No bitch like her threatens me. Didn't you hear her? She just said she killed my friend. - Shut up! You're a freak, just like your namesake, and if you're not careful, someone's gonna beat the living hell out of you! - I'm gonna go find Joey. I've had enough of you. If anything happens to my friend, you're gonna be talking to the cops. - Hey! Don't forget to tell them what you tried to do to me. - You asked for that, baby. Don't forget it. (thunder crashes) - Come on, you guys. Let's let Jack cool down while we grab a drink. Can't get out of here anyways. - She's not coming with us. - You can't tell me what to do. - Oh yes, I can. - Melissa, I'm not gonna throw her out, okay? - I'm not going anywhere. - She's just some stupid girl who can't get over her dead boyfriend. Get a life. If you're good in bed, there's a million men ready to fall in love with you. I call, he comes. - Shut up. You're disgusting. - I'm not gonna shut up. You shut up! Listen, chickie, you can get out of here anytime. Why not now? Maybe you'll be next. Maybe you can join your precious boyfriend! - People like you shouldn't talk. Everything that comes out of your mouth is infested. - Melissa, what's wrong? (Melissa gags) What is it? What is it? What is it? Oh my, oh my god. She's bleeding. Mel, Mel! - Joey? Damn it, where is he? - [Joey] Hey. - Joey? - [Joey] Jack! - That you man? Stop fooling around. I want to get out of here. - [Joey] Come on, Jack. - [Jack] Joey? - [Joey] Jack. - Where are you, Joey? (deep rumbling) What the hell? (Jack grunts) (eerie music) (Jack screams) - [Frederick] What happened? - I don't know exactly. She couldn't talk, and then she went unconscious. - [Frederick] She's been unconscious most of her life, spiritually speaking that is. - No one asked for your opinion. In fact, I didn't invite you to this party. Just to be safe, why don't you leave? - Chad, there's a hurricane out there! Where's he gonna go? I mean, he wouldn't get further than 20 feet. - That's his problem. - What seems to be your problem? - I don't have any problem. - What about your good friend, greed? You owe everything to him. I'm afraid he'd not gonna let you go until you pay him back in full. (thunder crashes) Then there's our lucky lady. She's escaped death and damnation once already, but I have a feeling that her lucky streak's just about to run out. You see, she's manipulated so many people with her beauty and her sex that it's become a fatal fault. And, that leaves Annika, dear, sweet, Annika. You're the only one who has the power to alter your destiny, simply by letting your past go out into the air like a breath, and underneath will be exposed this beautiful, pure soul just waiting to be set free. It's not a game, Chad. You have everything to lose. - Whatever. Weirdo. (thunder crashes) - So, how's Melissa doing? - Well, at least she's resting. - And you? - Better. I'm feeling much better. Try a shot. It'll relax you. Bottoms up. (Annika coughs) You think Jack really walked out the front door in this hurricane? - I doubt it. He's probably pouting in a corner somewhere. It sounds like someone's here. Maybe a Jack running back in. - Hopefully it's someone that'll get us out of here. - Well, I made it. - Countess? - [Countess] And, you must be Chad. - How did you get here? - I have a two-ton truck, four-wheel drive, 30 inch tires with traction to spare. - Why in the hell would you drive here in the middle of the storm? - To pick up my exhibit, remember? You know, Halloween? I couldn't let a little thing like a hurricane stop me. Mind you, it is getting quite nasty, though. Are my guys here yet? - Countess, I don't think anybody else is coming. - Of course they will. Otherwise, they won't have a job. So, where is my lovely Madness Maze? - It's upstairs. Something really weird's going on around here. - Fabulous, a mystery. - It's not so fabulous. There's two people missing upstairs, and we don't know where they are. - Well, why don't you and I go investigate? - I'd rather not leave them alone. - It's okay. I'll watch Melissa. It's okay, go. It's all right. - We'll be as fast as we can. Come on, Countess. It's this way. (mysterious music) - Annika? (Annika gasps) - You startled me. - I just wanted to say goodbye. - I don't want you to go. You're the only one who's keeping me sane. There's so many weird things going on here. I mean, maybe this place is haunted. I did know two people who were murdered here. - Ian was one of them. - How did you know that? - I looked. That's all any fortune teller is really. Just somebody taking the time to actually see. It's simple. Let me show you. - So Chad, who was that lovely young lady you were talking to? - Her name's Annika. She's in love with somebody else, Countess. - Never stopped me. All of my husbands were married when I met them. Husbands make the best husbands, you know. I don't believe it. - What? - Is it really? (eerie music) - [Annika] Now what? - Now you stare into my eyes. (Annika laughs) - I feel silly. - No, it's just for fun, truly. Trust me, you're gonna feel a thousand times better when we finish. - Okay, go ahead, but no cheating. You can't tell me anything I've already told you. - What is it? - There was this infamous murder case in a convent. Brave people were killed, including two nuns. They never found the bodies, but what they did find was a huge ornate mirror in a pool of blood, and from the pictures I could swear it looks just like this one. - That's quite impossible. Mirrors can't kill people. - You came here tonight to wage war on your past, to hopefully forge some kind of peace with that dark emptiness that lives inside you. I know it hurts. - It does hurt. Please help me. I don't want to it to hurt anymore. - Just breathe. Relax. Come with me. I can take you to a place where love lives forever. All you have to do is remember how you got there and how to stay there. - So, tell me about these weird happenings. (suspenseful music) - Well, it all started in this room. Annika was struck by some kind of a lightning bolt that came out of that mirror. And, then we were all knocked out. I'd say things started getting pretty weird after that. - Yes. And, I'd like to talk to this Annika. I think maybe somehow she's the key to all this. - Key to what? - We have a mean, son of a bitch mirror on our hands, Chad. (both laugh) - Could you pinch me please? Ow, not so hard. I just wanted to see if I was dreaming. - You're not. We are really married and officially on our honeymoon. - That's what I thought. I'm so happy I could scream. - Go ahead, everyone will think I'm driving you crazy. - Oh yeah? Well, you're not gonna get off that easily. - I didn't know married women could kiss like that. - Oh yeah, well you're in for the night of your life. You will be screaming. - I think we should have a contest. See who can scream at the loudest. - You're on. (both scream) What happened? - You were in a trance, darling. - But, Frederick was just here. Where is he? - I don't know. - Who's Frederick? - This weird homeless guy that's been living here. Personally, I think he's part of all this. - You're crazy. He has absolutely nothing to do with any of this. - Now listen, little girl. None of us is innocent, and this mirror has a history to it. I know it's unbelievable, but some things just can't be explained. I believe the mirror's a gateway. - A mirror? A gateway? What exactly are you talking about? - I believe the mirror is a gateway between the past, the future, heaven, hell. I don't know. But, if I'm right it needs a protector, a host, a champion. I think we should go find this Frederick. I think he's the one, or if he isn't he certainly knows something about all the weird goings on. - Wait a minute, I can't leave Melissa here alone. (eerie music) - She's gone. - [Countess] The mirror room. - What the hell? Melissa? - Don't go near her, Chad! - Melissa? Melissa! (dramatic music) (Annika cries) Annika, wait! Annika, stop! Annika, listen. I want you to try and understand what's going on. - Understand? Understand what? Melissa just... I don't even know what! I'm being stuck here where Ian died with a bunch of people who just hate me. We're just... we're just seeing Ian everywhere I go. (somber music) (Countess gasps) - It's rude to sneak up behind someone. You must be Frederick. - Frederick Champion at your service. - Of course, you are. - You wanted to speak with me? - What are you doing with Annika? I know you're not really a bum. - Oh, I know. You're not really a countess. You are a useless fake and a sham like your exhibit. You're filled with half truths and theatricals. You, my lady, are a joke. - Haven't you figured out that we're all part of the same joke? At least I know my weaknesses. - Oh, and I have yet to discover my weaknesses. It seems to me that I am fated to continually be in complete control. - Including Annika? You and I both know who's controlling the situation. - Her brief moment of time is vanishing. Very soon I'll own her soul forever. - Oh, this hurts. It hurts so bad. And, I just want it to stop. I'd do anything, anything to make it stop. - I think you underestimate her. - I know that you underestimate me. - Evil is always easy. It's the ones that are hard to break, the ones that are pure of soul that are hard to break, like Annika. - Three people are dead because of her, and your little friend Chad, he's going to follow in their path, and I think, my beautiful darling, that your day of reckoning has arrived. - I'm not afraid of you. No power here. We both know that Annika is the one with the power, and I'm gonna find her, and help her destroy you. (eerie music) (Countess screams) - What's that? - It sounds like the Countess. - Oh my god, the Countess. - Countess? Countess? Countess! Listen Annika, I'm getting you out of here right now. I want you to listen to me first. I think the Countess is right. I think you're the key to all this. Maybe it's got something to do with Ian and the night he died. - No, don't say anything about him! - [Chad] It's time someone did. - I don't want to do it. I can't hear it. - [Chad] What happened to Ian? - No! - [Chad] Tell me what happened to Ian. - Frederick! Frederick, my god. - It's okay. (Annika cries) - What's happening to me? - It's not what's happening to you. - [Chad] He's crazy, get away from him! - It's what you're creating. The power's yours. - You mean I'm doing all this? I don't understand. - Don't you see what he's trying to do? - You don't need to understand. You only need to know that I can hear you. I can change all your pain into pleasure. I can turn your loss into tithe. I can make all your dreams become a reality. - Annika, don't listen to him. - Chad! What are you doing? Don't hurt him! - It's impossible to leave with Chad. It's impossible for you to leave at all. See, your whole being is now tied to this place. If you should leave, why you would simply dissolve like one of those dreams that you have, and you can't quite remember when you awaken. Come. Look. You're dead, Annika. - No, I'm not dead. I'm alive! - Why? Because of that constant ache that you feel, or is it because of that continual pain that grabs you, and it holds you, and it won't let you go? That's the pain of your soul, Annika. And, that pain gives you for one brief moment a chance to choose, but you must choose now. Will you spend eternity alone in the agony of a lost love? Or, will you spend your everlasting life together with Ian, his arms caressing you, while you wrap yourself in a world of mirrors forever? You must decide now, Annika. - The mirror? The mirror. The mirror. I want you to show me the truth! (eerie music) I love you. Ian. Not yet. Oh my god. He's not dead yet. I can still save him. - All those deaths that you're responsible for they carry a price a price you're stained with. Your soul, they make you mine. - No! You've been trying to trick me. I haven't killed anyone. They're not dead because no one here exists. - The hourglass has run out, Annika. I want you! - Stay where you are! I will not live in a dream. Ian's still alive, and I can save him. You can go to hell without me. Let Ian live! (Frederick screams) (dramatic music) (watch ticking) - Annika! Oh my god. (Ian cries) - I love you. - I will always love you. - I love you. (somber music) (dramatic music)
