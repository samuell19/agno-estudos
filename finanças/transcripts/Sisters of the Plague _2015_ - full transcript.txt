(electronic jingle) - [Jo Voiceover] Inside of us there is a river and when the sun shines on that river it is maybe yellow or pink or red. And when the moon shines on the river it is black and white. So inside of your river, you have all of these colors and what you do with them is your decision. But you may swim in the dark moonlit river, the same way you swim in the colorful river of daylight. So as you are all here to conjure your own darkness, feel yourself swimming more easily, into the depths of who you are. (whimpering) - It's definitely the place where she drowned but it's not, I never see her in the dream, I just feel her presence like, ergh. And it's not positive. That's maybe the worst part about it. It's like, I could be having this dream about her and that it would be so negative and scary. I think that's the thing I fucking hate the most. I just really want them to go away. - I think you're just really stressed out. Like, you've been talkin' to me about work and you've been talking to me about these weird things that are going wrong. I think the only way that you're going to figure it out is if you talk to your dad. (smooching) (distant clapping) - Okay, so our next spot you can view right form this corner. Does anyone recognise this house? Right here, this green one? Have you seen it before ever, maybe? - The lower mansion? - Yes, yeah from Interview With A Vampire. But actually, the place that we're really interested in is the one right next door. It's the one with the big brick chimneys. This tale is about Miss Julie. This French aristocrat, he was deeply in love with her and actually at that time she was what's known as a placee which is a legal mistress. But his family really wanted him to get married and to marry someone who wasn't you know obviously like, who was white like him. So Miss Julie up at the top, one night, as they were kind of preparing for the card game downstairs, she says to him like, "I really wanna be with you forever." And he's like, "that just can't happen." So Julie goes to see Marie LeVeux. She covers her in a love potion on her temples and on her throat. But while he's playing poker, he doesn't hear the normal sounds that Julie would make kind of like walking back and forth up there on the top floor. So, the night wears on. He finishes his poker game, everyone leaves. He runs up the stairs, doesn't see her in her room so he bursts through the roof and then there he sees Miss... He sees Miss Julie clinging to one of the chimneys and he grabs her up in his arms, she's freezing cold, shaking, shivering and he takes her downstairs and holds her, while she dies in his arms. - That was a good one. - Really appreciate it and you guys were a great audience, I don't know, audience isn't the right word but yeah. - Um here's um. - Oh thanks, thank you, appreciate it, awesome. I was gonna say, if you're into this sorta thing, we do like once a month, we do a haunted gatherings so I'm gonna give you cards because it's performances and we go into a space, we go into like a haunted place and tell stories and it's pretty creepy. - [Woman Red Dress] Thank you, well we'll try to make it. - Okay please do, would be great to see you again. - Thank you. - Thanks again. - A fun night okay. - Bye. - Bye. - Goodnight ladies.

They like it you know, if you just like add a little intrigue at the end. So I just try to be creative with how the stores go. - Yeah. - [Jo] Do you miss mom? Do you ever miss mom? (sighs) - Yeah, I guess. Ah hah! First fucking guess. - [Jo] Well what can I say? You were always intuitive. when it came to opening beer bottles. (laughing) - When you're good, you're good. Somebody was up and down all night. Was that you or little sister Kate? - That was me, I've been having crazy dreams lately. - What about? - About mom actually. I think they're about mom, I don't know. - Just. - What? Do you dream about her? - Give it a rest. And join the club. - The club of? - All the bullshit those psychics put in her head. Down there in your little fuckin' French quarter. What a load of fuckin' crap. Mom saw psychics a lot, she drank a lot. (bell tone music) - Well drinking wasn't what killed her though. - And how the fuck do you know that? Did that come to you in your dream? - No. She didn't, she drowned so, it's a different kind of drowning. - [Bob] And the fuck do you think she got there hm? - I don't know. I guess I thought, like maybe, life being hard on you would've made you a little bit wiser. - Yeah well. - I was wrong. - Life is full of disappointments. How's that for wisdom? And I'm one, so deal with it. - The sad part is it's not disappointing, it's just exactly like it was. (thump) (bell tons humming) (glasses clink) - [Dance Coach] Pound pound pound go right, left. (growling) And right, left. (growling) And one two and. (screeching) Look and. (sputtering) One more time. - I wonder if we could break it up. I dunno, what am I trying to say? We could do it in like three parts, like one maybe like the opening. - [Female] I wanna save our energy for tomorrow, I mean the performance, performance. - Yeah yeah yeah. - [Female] You know what I mean? I don't wanna lose my voice before tomorrow. - No no no, yeah don't scream. (coughing) Yeah yeah, I wouldn't scream. - Is that okay? - The cross street yeah? - Here. - Also? - Michelle. - It's mandevil exterior yeah? - These two little girls, just so kind and sweet hearted were going to infect and destroy the entire new civilization. They were going to convince the entire community that these two little girls, these two poor seven year olds were witches and they'd come to destroy. So, slowly the mother goes house to house, home to home, these two witches have come, my new husband was infected with them and now he's here with them and he can't get rid of them, we must kill them. - Oh my god. - God you guys look great. - [Jo] Yeah no, nothing can interfere it's too beautiful. (coughing) - God dammit. (groaning) Oh Jesus, Jo? - Is Jo with ya? - She's not here? - She's usually here in the morning. God dammit. If you see her. (sighs) Just let me know. - I'll let you know. - [Male] Years ago, the prince wasn't ready to... (crickets chirping) (heavy rock music) - [Female] So, how was your night? - Oh it was good. - You look good. (chuckling) Don't laugh. - You just know always what to say. (giggling) - [Female] Believe me, don't listen to me. - [Jo] Hey ladies. - Oh hey. - How's it goin'? - [Jo] Good to see you. - You too, how are you? - Good. Hey. Tired? - Yeah just been working and then my brain hasn't been really. - [Jo] But you don't look drunk, so. - Not yet. (laughing) - Lady can I get you a drink? - [Jo] Uh, whiskey yeah. I'm sorry but are these new? - [Kate] They're Jenny's. - Oh wow. - Cheers. - Cheers. - [All] Cheers. (slow cello music) - Do you want a back massage? - No I'm okay. - You're okay? - I'm okay. I just, yeah, your dad was not doing well last night at all. He's, actually worrying me. - Like coughing or what was? - [Kate] Yeah he's coughing and moaning. - It's also kind of like my one chance to get, get to know him, so. - I just don't know how long I, can continue. - Yeah that must be really hard. It must be so hard to be around someone who's sick and who's like, unpredictable. Like we might show up and he might be vomiting or like, oh might not know if he's going to be okay all the time. God that's really hard. Isn't it so hard to be around someone who's like that? - Why are you turning into this? - I'm not turning into anything, that's what my life has been like for a long time. I just wanna be around him. This is like what I wanted for all of my childhood, just to be around him. And I was always like, ah. He was always not there, so it feels like a chance to get something that I didn't have before, so I would really like to take advantage of it. - Okay. - Kate? - [Kate] Yeah? - Do you hear that? Do you hear something? - No. - I mean, uh it's like... - [Kate] I'm not doing anything. Can you turn off that light? - [Jo] Hold on 'cause it's stopped for a second. (sighs) - I don't hear anything. - Yeah okay, yeah sorry, I guess, I dunno. (soft crackling) (Bob coughing) (slow music tone) - [Bob] Jo? (coughing) (soft crackling) (soft piano notes) (distant groaning and moaning) (muffled chanting) (mumbling) (thump) (thumping) - [Girls] Altogether this must stop. Kill them slowly, kill them off (grunting) (chanting) Kill them, kill then, kill them all Altogether this must stop kill them, kill them, kill them all (screaming) - And for centuries beyond people would say that they had now learned that you must never disturb the mother. All of New Orleans went up in flames. The one place that was a sanctuary, the one place that stood standing was this very house we're standing in now. (clapping) - The image of the horned beast with the tail. - [Jo] Oh yeah? - And the image of a goat, was originally not this icon of absolute evil but was this sort of cult for the oppressed of ancient Athens. You know, to me it's so interesting. - Wait are you a psychic? (laughing) I'm serious. - Me? Like, wait. (laughing) Like do I read the future? - No like can you tell what I'm thinking right now? - Definitely, but the future is. - Yeah I guess that's true, I guess I could try to tell what you were thinking too. - Can you see what I'm thinking right now? - A little bit yeah. - Well. Psychics don't read the future, real psychics don't read the future. - Yeah I know. - But they tell you what you need. - Yeah. - And do you need something? - I'm looking for, I would try to talk to someone. Yeah I actually am, I am really looking for someone to talk to about something. - [Male] Yeah, something specific. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah it's like, bleugh. I don't know. - Like what sort of thing? - Um. My mom. Yeah, I wanna talk to somebody about my mom. She's not alive anymore. - Okay. - But, I guess she saw a lot of people. She saw some psychics in like, probably like the 80s and early 90s. So if there was somebody practicing then that you happen to know. - [Male] Okay. - Even though you're not a psychic. Do you know any? (laughing) I don't know. - Someone who's been here for a while? - [Jo] Someone who's been doing it for a while. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah I may know somebody. - Okay. - Yeah. - [Jo] Oh good. - Her name is Pola. - [Jo] Okay. (chuckling) - What do you think baby? Oh you look good, oh me? I look divine. (laughing) Oh come on baby. Don't be like that. Take it down. (female mumbling) (laughing) Did I? No I didn't. (splashing) I'm just kiddin' around. (mumbling female) (whimpering) What are you talkin' about? Hey I got an idea, let's go out. Put on somethin' nice and we'll go out, huh? Let's do that. (heavy breathing) (door creaking) In vain I have said to him. In vain. I have striven, to teach my heart to bow. In vain have I said to him, there be many greater singers than thou. - [Jo] Bob? Bob we had an excellent night. Everything goes good. No not. And we're gonna make a big. Fuck, fuck fuck fuck. (sighs) In vain I've striven to teach my heart to bow, in vain I said to him, there be many great singers than thou. (mumbling) Yet there is upon me, a trembling in the twilight. Yet there is a, who's there? - Why are we here to speak to the spirit of Hattie Layfayet? 11 years old, who killed her two parents. We are here to communicate with her because we are also capable or taking a knife in our hands and stabbing someone that we love. And when we embrace that part of ourselves, we have nothing to fear. The eggs we have before us represents Nunes. A growth. So as we heat up the egg of Hattie Lafayet. As we give her life again tonight, may we also give life to the places in ourselves that have been lying dormant. Let yourself be hurt and afraid. Let yourself be deeply disappointed. You are letting yourself say yes to a place that has also gone unloved. (sighs) And as you breathe, we will share this silence with only the sound of our breath and with the breath of Hattie who's coming towards us. (haunting bell tone music) (soft crackling) (roaring) (screaming) (whimpering) (knocking) - Pola are you Pola? - I am Pola. - Hi I'm Josephine. - How can I help you? - Nike said maybe I could come over and maybe talk to you about some stuff that's been going on? I'm sorry he gave me your address, I hope it's okay. - [Pola] So you want some spiritual advice? - Yeah that would be great. - [Pola] Well if Nike sent you come on it. - Thanks, yeah nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Appreciate it. - Let's do a little bit of cleansing before we start this process. You've brought quite a few people with you here today. - What do you mean? - Well, as spiritual beings, we bring people from the beyond with us, both light and dark. - Okay. - And I'm censing a maternal figure. Do you hold the gift? - What gift? - [Pola] Do you also have the gift of sight? - [Jo] Oh I mean I don't think so, it would be nice. (laughing) Yeah that would be nice. - Yeah but have you been dreaming? Has your mother been coming to you in your dreams? - [Jo] Yeah. - Yeah. What is she saying to you? - [Jo] Um. - This is really... - [Jo] What is that one, what does that one mean? - It's the tower card. - Yeah? - And when the tower card hits you in a reading, it is total, like an annihilation of a reality or of a world. And in some ways there's a portal that is opening for you. But what you want to avoid is a black hole. You really are going to need, some kind of ritual or ceremony to just kind of cleanse out. There's just things that are attached to you. - [Jo] Yeah okay. - And I think what often happens is, things attach because you are this bright light. I just can't help but think that your mother, that this was foul play. That something else was going on. That's what she's telling me. If you're wanting to connect with her, she's letting us know through the reading that, she had, she doesn't want what happened to her, to happen to you. - Okay. - And I'm not sure I know what that is but maybe you know, maybe you know. - Yeah I don't know, I was like seven. - Oh, when she passed? I don't know, it's sort of like, from what I'm feeling, it's something that you need to be very careful of. And who is your mother? - Uh, her name's Margaret Stone. Do you think that, she could send someone else to tell me something or that she'd be trying to be communicating in some way? - [Pola] Well I think she sent you here. - I'm a little scared. - I know, I know, I know. I think that's why they found me, okay? So you're gonna be okay. And I'm gonna help you as much as I can. (gasping) - Okay? - Okay. (slow bell tones) (crackling) (harsh coughing) - Brr! (chuckling) Yeah. (sighs) Oh what a. Fuck you're a life saver. Thank you. - [Kate] Very strong. - Cheers. Oh. - [Kate] How's the beer? - [Bob] The beer is delicious, thank you so much. - Sorry she's not here. I don't really know what. - You're good you're good. - Prescriptions you're on. - Thank you, I really do. Thank you, thanks. (gentle TV string music) - [Bob] You kinda look upset, just sayin'. - You saying that 'cause you always look so good? (laughing) - [Bob] Come down to my world huh? No. I'm sayin' it 'cause believe it or not, in my small way, I care. (TV character whistling) - [TV Character] You just need to put your hand on this thing, even the dog knows it. - [Bob] The last person I talked to about shit was your mom. We talk a lot. - [TV Character] I just think of him a mortal soul. - [TV Character] How many mortal souls are you concerned. (dog whining) (TV mumbling) - [TV Character Female] Which do you think I should wear for the Englishman? The red or the blue? - [TV Male] I forbid you to talk this way. - [TV Male] You forbid? - [TV Male] Forgive me your excellency. My concern for the spiritual welfare of the countess, I say god bless him. I will pray for humanity. (drumming rock music) - You just have to center yourself. - No man this is not a centering yourself fucking moment. Like this is a, I don't know how it got to this point but it's not where I wanna be you know? I go to sleep and I fucking, I fucking hear him when I go to sleep every night. You don't know what the fuck he's saying. He's just mumbling on about fucking bullshit and it's not only bullshit, it's fucking creepy. I dunno, something's switched. - Yeah I don't really know enough to have an opinion on it. - I don't wanna talk about it. I didn't even wanna talk about it anymore, I don't wanna talk about it anymore. - We don't have to. - It's not bullshit, that's not even the words for what's going on right now. It's really fucked up. It's really fucked up. - [Tattooed Female] What choice does she have? - [Kate] What? Sorry I didn't hear you what? - [Tattooed Female] I mean it's family, these are the things we do for family. - Yeah but they're not fucking family, they're not family. They could've been a family if he stayed around, but they're not family. - I don't know. Maybe just for tonight you should put it outta your mind. Come here. (sighs) (haunting tones) (deep breathing) (moaning) (shallow gasps) (gasping) (choking) (phone ringing) - Kate? Kate? Kate? Okay okay, Kate. (whimpering) (crying) Fuck you. Okay. Must've been a hard night huh? You know what's dramatic? Is walking into the bathroom and not knowing if you're gonna be breathing or not, that's dramatic. - [Kate] That's not true. - Yeah, do you? Do you know what that felt like? I don't know if you, you don't know what that felt like so, that is true, that's true. - We don't have to do this, this doesn't have to be happening right now. - [Jo] I know, yeah that's right, it could just be like every other time that you fuck something up and I just don't say anything. - I fuck stuff up? - Yeah, yeah. - I fuck stuff up? - [Jo] Yeah. - You don't know anything about what I do for you. - Do you know what my life was like, like three hours ago? - Fuck you, just fuck you. - [Jo] Yeah okay. Fucking bitch, get out of my fucking house. - I'm not leaving, this is my house. - [Jo] You can go. - Don't fucking touch me. - You can go right now. - Don't touch me. - No no no, I'm gonna touch you because this is my bed, you're no longer sleeping in it. (smack) (gasping) - You stay the fuck away from me you fucking cunt! (heavy breathing) (fire crackling) - We have been called here this evening. To help a dear friend of ours, Miss Jo. Welcome to the circle. We are calling upon the gods and the goddesses of fire, to help burn the darkness and the blackness that is threatening her spirit and her soul. We use a white feather of peace. We ask that the great mother hold her as she would hold any of her children. (clinking and jingling) I offer a drink to the fire. A drink for you. A drink for you Hayoga. - Amen. Thank you. (laughing) (singing in foreign language) (soft crackling) - [Male] Our flesh is a gift and we thank you for it. And may our bodies magnify the wealth that you have bestowed upon us. - [Pola] My mother spoke of a Margaret. Long ago, it was a close friend of hers. I'm wondering if this was the same Margaret and from what my mother tells me, she was prone to playing with the darkness and so whatever this is, if this is the same Margaret, it's attached itself to you. (moaning and grunting) (speaking in foreign language) - [Male] The sense of the sacred is multi generational. Everything you could possibly imagine, your body is everything. (singing in foreign language) (harsh fractured crackling) (groaning vocal music) (fractured crackling) (engine rumbles) (screaming) (distant mumbling and groaning) (groaning vocal music) - I'm tired Josie. I'm tired and fed up. Oh Jesus. (mumbling) Where are you goin'? Jo I need your help. - [Katie] Jo, Jo? Jo, Josephine! Josephine. Josephine! (chattering) (slow bell tones) (gasping) (harsh coughing) (mumbling) - [Bob] Ah, don't call anybody, please please please please please. God damn. Shit. Oh god, just let me do this myself alright? Please. Shit. (coughing) - [Katie] What am I supposed to do, what I supposed to do? - Just get the fuck inside I'm alright. Just let me do this, please. Shit, oh fuck. Oh man. You're just nothin' like I thought. Do you just want me to get you some water? Or do you want me to leave? - Sit down, just sit down. It'll be fine. It's gonna fuckin' pass. God damn. - Okay Bob, just breathe. Whatever you wanna do. - [Bob] Thank you, thank you. Just stay right here. Oh shit. (sighs) (chuckling) You know, the clouds don't look a fuckin' bit different even though it's your last time. They're just clouds. (chuckling) Oh fuck me. This hurts. Fuck me. (soft whimpering) (harsh grunting) (violin music) (soft crackling) (muffled mumbling) (muffled crackling) (groaning) - What happened to Jo's mother? - It's not important. She died. - How did she die? - It was a long time ago. - [Katie] Bob can you help me please? I need to know what happened? - What? - Whatever's happening to Josephine. - You guys just gotta leave this shit alone. - Bob, Bob. - Leave it alone. - [Katie] But it's real and I saw something. - [Bob] Oh god. Don't start this stuff please please please. - I need to know, I need to know what happened. - No you don't, no you don't, no you don't. - For somebody to trust you that much, and then she showed it to me and then she showed me how. She asked me. She showed me how, she said, "Bob, "put my head under please. "Keep it there a while. "Keep it there a while." - [Katie] What do you mean? - So I did. I killed my wife. And I've killed her everyday since. Jo, Jo, I think I need to go to the hospital baby, I'm not feelin' good. (gasp) (groaning) (slow groaning vocals) - You stop it this time. (slow bell tones) (soft crackling) (muffled crying and whimpering) (soft bell tone music)
