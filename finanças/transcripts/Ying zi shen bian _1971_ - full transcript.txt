The Chief of Xuanwu Security knew that ...a lot of people were trying to steal So he asked Chief Hong ...to help in the escort Fang Chengtian stole... while Chief Hong was in charge They were sworn brothers That's not the way you treat a friend Chief Hong was humiliated He has been asking others to help look for Fang He's never stopped in the past 15 years He won't let Fang off the hook There's no need to tell her anymore Just ask her Would you speak or not? I can kill you easily I know nothing Then today is your day to die Chase Uncle Fang, what they were saying... Absolutely nonsense, I didn't do it Then why are you hiding from Hong Dapeng and Wang Jianxin? I'll tell you about it later on I'd never lie to you Hurry to Dafeng town What for?

I'll go look for him You can go now Yes Fang Chengtian, you're finally here I'm not Fang Chengtian Miss Yun, sorry Even if Fang Chengtian's here What was that strike in the dark about? He'd deserve it Why isn't he here? Scared to see me? I've given him your message He asked me to be here first. He'll come later I'm just afraid he might have deceived you No He'll be here after he's taken care of 16 Bandits of Yanyun He's a decent brave man The Sixteen Bandits? Yes They're here for the jewelry You're here for that too? And a deep grudge Chief Yang of Xuanwu Security was my uncle Fang Chengtian robbed the jewelry And my uncle's reputation was ruined; my aunt hanged herself! I've to get even Uncle Fang said he didn't do it Everyone said he has no morals That's why they're all after him If he didn't do it Then why was he hiding here... for 15 years? That's just between me and him I have no intention to harm you Go this way Yes You over there Yes, come here go Where's Fang Chengtian's daughter? Upstairs You're his daughter? No, my surname is Yang I'm not his daughter Hong Dapeng is right If we hold you as the bait Fang Chengtian will fall into the trap Trying to catch me? They are downstairs What do you plan to do?

I have searched that side Where are they? They ran off that way Mr. Xu, tell Chief Hong to block all the paths. We'll chase from here Sure, follow me Yes Go... Where are we going? Where do you want to go? Take me to Fang Chengtian Uncle Fang said he'll come and meet you You don't need to go look for him But Hong Dapeng has got so many men ...here in Dafeng For time being he won't make it even if he wishes You think little of Uncle Fang If he knows that Hong Dapeng is after me He'll sure be here to save me No matter what, I want to find him Take me there That was a good move But you'd never have imagined that... I'll be waiting here for you Chief Hong Little brat, where's your father? Tell me You've got the wrong person I'm not his daughter. My surname is Yang Yang? How do you know me? I've seen you before, of course I know you Chief Hong, why are you trying ...to kill Miss Yang? Fang Chengtian will show up if I kill her Why are you on her side? She's not related to Fang Chengtian There's no point to kill her You see, I too am looking for Fang Chengtian You too? Tell me the truth Who are you and what's your background? Chief Yang of Xuanwu Security was my uncle I'm looking for Fang Chengtian for revenge So you are the student of... Seven Stars Swordsman Diancong? I've heard a lot about you It so happens that your enemy isn't Uncle Fang Uncle Fang said he didn't do it Chief Hong, I'm more eager... to get hold of Fang Chengtian than you do This has got nothing to do with Miss Yang We shouldn't bother her I don't care. She was with Fang Chengtian I might as well kill her C'mon, quick Chase them You... You were the one looking for me? Follow me, we mustn't stay here Just tell me what you've got to say Do you think you can control me? Say, even if I can't You must admit the crime you did 15 years ago We've never met before What have I ever done to you? You stole the jewelry of Xuanwu Security Killed my uncle's family That's a crime, isn't it? If I did that... Do you think I'd have saved you just now? Uncle Fang, I believe you didn't do it But I don't understand why You're hiding and don't explain yourself? I've been living in seclusion for the past 15 years because I'm trying to protect one person Who is it? For whom? For you, kid Me? What's this got to do with Miss Yun? Come with me For the last fifteen years I've been worshipping the spiritual tablets of Chief Yang and his wife. Never stopped I just wish that their spirits will help me to find their enemy So that I can take revenge for them But until today, I've still been wronged Being taken for as a criminal So you didn't rob the jewelry? Kaiyun Come here and kneel down These are the tablets of your late parents I... You're Chief Yang's daughter Everyday I sit here for long hours Thinking about the past! And I've sketched everything that happened ...in an album. It's on the table You'll understand after going through it Have a seat I'm delighted that Chief Yang is here It means a lot to me I'm here to ask a favor This time I'm to escort families of some officials and 300,000 taels worth of jewelery to the north For this I've also asked Chief Hong's help Dapeng mentioned it's a risky route If Brother Fang can come with us We'll have nothing to worry about I'm here to solicit your help If only you would agree I'm flattered Please don't listen to Brother Hong's brag about me I don't live up to my reputation The power of Shadow Whip has in fact... astonished many. Help me out here I'd much appreciate that Oh, come on. Please don't mention it We're sworn brothers I'd do anything in my power to help And I'd be delighted to be of assistance to Chief Yang, head of security Then it's a promise Certainly When do you intend to leave? We're putting up at Anpu Town tonight We'll leave early in the morning Fine, let me take care of my errands first I'll meet you at Anpu Town tomorrow morning It's settled then Say goodbye to Uncle Fang Yes Goodbye Uncle Fang, see you tomorrow Great We're off then Please Please stay Goodbye Master Fang Yes? I heard that the Sixteen Bandits of Yanyun have arrived the outskirts of Daming They planned on robbing Xuanwu's job Can you trust the source? It's been verified The Sixteen Bandits are ruthless and will do whatever it takes We must alert Chief Yang soon Get the horse Yes The fire started at the inn... which Chief Yang stayed in It was chaotic Chief Yang was fending like crazy with the masked robber The guards were fighting for their lives also I tried to take a good look at the masked man He had a whip as weapon The same style as mine I knew at the time that... He's trying to let the others think that he's me to shift the blame onto me I wanted to charge in and tackle that fellow If only at the time I could've caught him red-handed! While I was about to charge in Uncle Fang Uncle Fang! Strange, gone in a flash That man had a whip He must be the Shadow Whip Right Now since Chief Yang is dead What should we do now? You go and look for Chief Hong I'll report this We must punish the Shadow Whip Let's go find Fang Chengtian He must pay for this, go I took you and fled afar I knew well, if the murderer knew that ...the Yangs have a survivor He'd try to kill you In order to protect you We couldn't go back to our homes I knew I was being set up But there's nothing I could do then I raised you so that you can avenge your parents Uncle Fang, it's my fault No, kid You're still very young I didn't want you to get into trouble But now you must kill this robber I intended to pass this album to you the day I die, in case I can't find the murderer So that you'll understand everything then Uncle Fang, you had it all thought out It's all because of the relentless murderer Look what he got ourselves into I've been thinking all these years ...who could that be? I was so little then I couldn't remember a thing If only I could recognize the murderer Then it will be all clear I must kill him I can think of one man though Who? Chief Hong, Hong Dapeng Him? We're sworn brothers It's impossible But there's no sign of him anywhere in... your album after the robbery Where was he? I didn't notice Hong Dapeng had an excellent plan He went with my uncle to ask for your help So that you'll know where they're at Then he impersonated you in the robbery So that you'll take all the blame Otherwise, there's no need to wear a mask and hold a whip Quite right, I've never suspected him He could be the one What made you think that he's the one? He left a clue today A clue? At Dafeng Town He assumed you're Master Fang's daughter He didn't pay any attention to you After you told him you're a Yang He panicked He was trying to kill you Right, I called him Chief Hong Then he asked me whether I knew him He tried hard to kill me And was quite determined too I've got an idea We'll use this soft spot When you see him again Pretend that you knew him ...and test the waters See what he has got to say Search... They're here Go What do you find? Nothing Go Master Xu, we've searched everywhere No one's here Chief Hong, there's no one at the back And no one in the front Where could they be? Everyone There's no need to search, I'm here I was looking for you too Where's Fang Chengtian? I think you'll be happy to find me here There's no need to find Fang Chengtian Because I'm more important than Fang Am I right, Chief Hong? We're looking for Fang Chengtian ...to take revenge for Chief Yang Hand Fang Chengtian over Thank you, everyone I'm the daughter of Chief Yang I'm trying to avenge my father's murder What's that got to do with Fang Chengtian? Wait, Chief Hong We all know that the daughter of Chief Yang ...was killed in the fire 15 years ago Could this really be her? I seem to have seen that girl before She looks familiar Can you prove that you're Chief Yang's daughter? Yes, can you prove it? Speak UP You might not believe what I'm about to say But I think the robber who set the fire ...wouldn't believe this But I saw the murderer I know who he is Chief Hong, what have I done to you? Why do you want me dead? Let her speak, Chief Hong Since she saw the murderer Let her speak Tell us who is responsible Let her tell us Even if she's the daughter of Chief Yang She was only five, six years old then Don't listen to her nonsense Calm down Just listen to her first Miss Yun, please come down here Who is he? The one who robbed the money ...and killed my father, was Chief Hong! What rubbish! I may have been quite young then However I did manage to see your face I remembered That day at night, you looked so murderous! You sprang out from the fire And you killed one after another As if you've gone mad! I was hiding underneath the bed That's so crazy I wore a mask then You couldn't have recognized me So everyone heard that loud and clear? He admitted it It was you, Chief Hong? How could this be? Yes, it was me And so what can you do to me, huh? Who dares to come? It has been 15 years We've only found out the truth today You robbed and made me to be a scapegoat The deaths of the Yangs and other innocent people You must pay for it What have you got to say now... In front of all of us? Fine, let's go
