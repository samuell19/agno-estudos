Hello. Leave your message after the beep. Natasha, Alik, are you back? Hello? Alik, my heartfelt congratulations on your return. Calm down, no one's back yet. - Will they be much longer? - I don't know. - When are you coming back? - Whenever they arrive, I'll come back. You won't stay for a while? - As if I would! - Stay for a bit. Not a chance. SISTERS Mum, I need to go to the toilet. For heavens sake! Can't you sit still? Not long now. Well, everything's fine. Soon. They are signing someone out, and Alik is next. It's taking so long. Mum, do you know what is this "prison"? There! There's Dad! What's this then? It's from a cold. Alik! - Hello! - Hi. - Congratulations on getting out. - The same to you. Can we talk for a moment? Listen, the money issue has come up. Kostya's asking. The cops took the money. Ask them. They say they didn't take it. And? And we need to get it back. Come on, Dad, I need to go to the toilet. The meat is probably dry by now. You are not supposed to cook it for three hours. We were waiting so long! I'm worn out. Well, get used to it. It won't be the last time. Hello, Uncle Misha. Don't touch! Mum, why is she giving orders for? Don't touch. Go sit at the table. I'll bring everything in. - How's grandma? - Fine. - Give her a call. - Fine. - Have you boiled the beetroot? - Yes. Ironed some clothes, too. I'd have done it myself. You can iron your husband's shirts. I didn't touch them. - I am already like Cinderella around here. - Cut it out! Go bring the fish. Hi, there. Hello. Taking off already? Did you eat some chicken? Here's some money for Grandma. - Thanks. You'll phone, right? - I'll phone tomorrow. Can you pick Dina up from school tomorrow? No, I have training. You can pick her up from her music lesson, then. Come on, Sveta, he is not such a bad man. - Yeah, just hopeless. - After all... he helps you with the shopping, and gives you money. Stolen money. They don't lock up good men. Nowadays they do. Someone tells tales. After all, they let him out almost straight away. Paid someone some money, got let out. Anyway, let me listen. Don't take too long. Sveta, hey, Sveta! Wanna go see a movie? I've already seen everything that's on. Maybe to a cafe, then? - What, you've got some money, then? - Yes. Right, you probably stole it from your parents. No, I earned it at the camp! - Are we going to a cafe, then? - What for? - Well, people go out to places, don't they? - People do a lot of stupid things, don't they? Hello! How romantic! Isn't it about time you got married, Malinina? Listen, Klimkin, have you got any goals in your life? Well, I'd like to go and live in Germany. They treat Jews well in there. And you? I'll go to Chechnya, as a sniper. How? On a contract. On whose side? On our side, of course. Not for the Chechens! Could you really shoot someone? If I had to, I could. Sveta, I wanted to ask you. Your Dad's a Chechen, isn't he? Is he from Chechnya? Listen. First, he is not my Dad. That's first. Secondly, he's from Daghestan, big difference. That's secondly. Mum, can't he buy you a dishwasher? What for? - Why waste money? - You're right. - Because it's so hard earning money his way. - Oh, come on, really! Don't forget to pick the kid up from the music lesson. Don't worry, I am not going to forget about your kid. You asleep? No. What's up? Not much. Maybe Dina should take up some sport, too? Wouldn't hurt. Otherwise she'll grow up a pansy weakling. Well, you're exaggerating. She plays the violin, sees a tutor, takes drawing lessons. Have you seen her drawings? She'll need to see a shrink soon. Can you light me a cigarette? My nails are wet. And give me an ashtray. He promised we'd go to Austria. Alpine skiing. Just don't break your neck there. I don't want to be left looking after your kid. No, I think we're all going. Do you love him, mum? Yes. Why? He's my husband. Who was Dad, then? Better to think he never existed. So, my place has been taken? Yes, Alik, that's what was decided. You've still got to pay the money back, though. How much do they say is missing? Today, one million. Give it back today, and you'll get your place back. One million? I want my place vacated today. Dad! - Go in. - Okay. Everything okay? They were lurking near the music school. - Who were they? - Kostya's men, in a Pajero SUV. Right, stay here. Don't touch the blinds. Don't use the phone. Got it? There's food there. But, I've got training tomorrow. Don't worry. I'll train you myself later. I'm not staying here with her. You'll stay and you'll behave. Something smells in here. - Alik, I'll stay with them. - You are coming with me. Everything has to look normal. Kids are at their relatives. We're at home. We'll solve this tomorrow. You're right, there's some sort of smell! Dina, you do what Sveta says, and I'll come tomorrow. And you be in bed by 9 p.m. It was the fish that was smelling. What if the owners come back? Don't worry, they won't be back. The owner died recently. Why have you dolled yourself up? I like it. Where did you get the lipstick? From the bathroom. Go wash it off. We were told not to use the phone. Can you keep quiet? Grandma? Hi, it's me. I'm staying at the Klimkins' dacha. Trains were canceled. I'll be back tomorrow. Don't worry about me. Worry about yourself. Have you taken your medicine? Alright then, bye. Don't you know that lying is wrong? Who told you that? My Dad. And did he tell you why they want to kidnap you? They steal a lot of kids nowadays. Would be better if they'd kidnapped you. Then I wouldn't be stuck here. At some dead guy's apartment. You only listen to your Tsoi. He must have died a hundred years ago. For starters, he was killed. Because of someone like you. Some stupid girl jumped out into the road. He crashed to avoid her. You promised you'd phone. I don't know if I should come around or not. Call me. Bye. Dmitry Valerievich, from the car service. We changed the filters last Tuesday already. Tell us when you want to come pick it up. Goodbye. Dima, it's Mum. Please, call. Grandma's been taken to the hospital. - Do you want a banana? - Alright. Give me money for bread! - Where are your parents? - Got no parents. Give me. You parents probably force you to beg? - Where're your mum and dad? - In prison. Give me money for bread. Well, here's some bread. Bitch! I tell you, they are not hungry. They don't take bread. They just want money! I always test it like this. Hot pies! Meat or potato pies. Pies anyone? Would you like some pies? Let's have a pie! Young man! - Are these fresh? - Very fresh. - With meat or potatoes. This one's with meat. - Okay. Two meat pies, then. 12 rubles. - How much? - The ones with potato are five. Meat, six. Which one do you want? Potato. Thank you. - Did you phone Dad? - Who else? Let's go. Where are we going? Mum's relatives live here. Do they know we are coming? Mum probably phoned them. Hello, are your parents home? Mum! Sveta's here. Natasha's daughter! With the other daughter! Hello, Auntie Zoya! Hello. Auntie Zoya, this is Dina. Can we stay with you for a day? Valera! Didn't Mum phone you? What? Hello, Uncle Valera! Hello. Hi, hi. Natasha's kid? Yes. Get in the house, quick! You in some sort of trouble? No, they were supposed to pick us up. We need to phone them, to tell them we are here. Yes, Natasha called, but you have to understand. Her father will walk free again, but what about me? Try to understand, I've got two kids to look after. If you really need something, I will help you. - As long as we won't have any trouble later. - Oh... in that case we'll go. Goodbye. Goodbye. There's no smoking in here, Alik. What have you come for? Have you brought the money? Kostya, just tell me one thing. Do you believe me, or the cops? I believe that someone's should pay up. If you want to listen, listen. I didn't take the money. I swear on my kid's life. And it's not you that's asking me for it. Kostya, I came to you myself. You are not a dog... and I am not a wolf. Leave the kid alone. I won't run from you. It's not you I need. I need the money. And your kid now costs... two million. I'm hungry. I haven't eaten anything, either. You can buy ice cream over there. I've only got three rubles left. Only enough for a phone call. Maybe we could ask someone. - What? - Well, money or bread. You want to start begging on trains? We could sing. And people would give us money. Well, go ahead. If you have the audacity. Just be careful they don't put you in a nuthouse. Let's go! Pies! Stand back. Hey, what about me? Hey, where are the owners? Are they dead? No, they are alive for the time being. Who lives here? Leave me alone! What difference does it make to you? I am sick of chasing around strange houses with you. Me, too. Don't you understand why are we hiding? Want me to explain? It's because your dad's a gangster, and you're a gangster's daughter. Liar! Liar! He's not a gangster! A gangster. A real gangster. And a thief. Got it. And then where did they go? No one knows? Okay. Go check that phone. Careful how you pay off the police. They were in Kurovskoye. They dropped in on some relatives. The relatives wouldn't let them in. What did you expect? People are afraid. It's only you that's never afraid. Find them that money! It's too late to find the money. Now we have to find the children. Tomorrow I'll find them myself, and we'll get out of here. Don't pick it up. Can I try one more time? This is a work phone. Please, I'll make it quick. Tanya, it's me again. Where was that call from? Tanya, look up where it is. Revyakino? Okay, thanks. Hi, Klimkin, it's me. Lyosha, something's up. I need some money. A lot. As much as you've got. When can you give it to me? Come afterward then. I'm at your dacha. You've forgotten where your dacha is? Zelenovod village, Tchaikovsky street, house 15. Got it? And bring something to eat. Dina! Dina! Dina! Dina! Idiot! I've got my make-me-invisible hat on. What're you shouting for? Idiot! If you want, we can go somewhere. Alright. What sort of dance is that? It's a belly dance. I'm getting sick from the height. So? Me too. Will we be riding the Ferris wheel for much longer? Until we are really sick. Have you ever kissed someone? As if! Well, have you got a boyfriend? - There is one. - And? Nothing. At that age, boys are just kids. The old man tried to scare them. They were in a SUV, waiting for someone. They hit the old man and set the house on fire. First time I have ever seen them here. Yes, I'm sure, a foreign-make SUV. What happened here? A fire. Listen, Lyosha, do you understand? They want to kidnap her. - Chechens? - I don't know. What have Chechens got to do with it? We have to get out of here. This is for you. Thank you. - Did you bring the money? - You see, I was offered this CD. A brand new one. So now I've only got ten rubles left. Why did you even come then? Well, we agreed. You'll probably catch hell from your parents for this. Actually, no. You gave me the wrong address. My dacha is actually number 17. That's the one, right over there. Why are you two smiling like idiots? My hat has just gone up in flames. What are we going to do now? We could go to the police and try telling them everything. I don't think we should go to the police. They might send Dad back to prison. Get in. What are you waiting for? I'm not going. What can they do to us? Maybe nothing to you. - Hello. - Hello. We were here on a class excursion, and got lost. It's easy to get lost. I've got to phone my parents. You know where I could find one? It's not far. Get in. Go and eat. Go. Can I make a phone call? The lamp's burnt out. Imagine, you're walking at night, and suddenly the lights go out! You'll think you've been wiped out. How old are you? Thirteen. Do you want to work? I don't know. Doing what? What can you do? She can shoot. Your sister? Yes. I can play the violin. And sing. Good. Come on, get up. Stand up. Come here. - Where are you from? - From town. We got left behind by our group. Easy now, honey! - Do you have flees? - Don't touch! Don't touch! I'll tell my Dad you touched me! He'll kill you all! My dad's a gangster. He's called Alik Murtazaev. And this is my sister. To the market! I play on a half-size. You mean you can't play the violin? This is full-size, for grown-ups. You have to play for grown-ups. What, like an idiot? It won't sound good! Doesn't have to sound good. Has to sound pitiful. 15 rubles a bottle. We earn a ruble for each sold. Am I supposed to walk around on the trains with them? They sell well at the market too. Hey, little girl. What's this place called? Kurovskoye station. You got any beer in there? Cola, Pepsi, Sprite. Listen, get us some beer, would you? Bring it there. Hey, have you people got any gangsters around here? Bring it over, alright? Again? I can't believe it! - Have these guns been sighted? - Of course. Of course, always. Roma doesn't need sighted guns! Come on! Missed again! - Who's next, then? - No way. Can I? Alright. What are you betting? What do you mean? Well, we are playing for money. Bet your drink-cooler. It's not mine. All the more reason to, then. Well done, little girl. - How was the gun? - Nothing special. You hear that, darky? Will you be my bodyguard? - Alright. - It's a deal. When you get a bit older, I'll take you out of here. To Moscow. Hey, little girl, no scum bothering you around here? Well, if someone touches you, just tell me. Well, okay then. - Want one? - We've got money. Thank you. We'll wait here. Are the cops looking for you? Yes. Wait here. What's he giving orders for? What about the money? We're not prostitutes, we just got lost. We are on a school trip. - Full name? - Malakhova, Svetlana Aleksandrovna. - Date of birth? - April 19th, 1987. Address? 8 Arsenalnaya, apartment 4. - Your sister? - Yes. You look different. Full name? - Murtazaeva Dina-- - Doesn't she... know her own name? - She knows. - Then let her answer for herself. Full name and date of birth? Murtazaeva, Dinara Albertovna, June 24th. June 24th of what? Year of birth? 1991. Murtazaeva. - Your parents are looking for you, you know. - I know. Well, go and make a call. Quiet! Hello? It's Platonov. We've found the children, Murtazaeva Dinara and Malakhova. Yes. Yes, there're here. Pick them up. At the Oktyabrsky police department. Okay. Okay, good. Next time we'll put you in the cells, got that? Pavlovich, should I take them over? You stay here. Let's go. - Hello. - Hello, Dina. - Yours? - Yes, ours. Thank you. Sorry for the trouble. It's them. Please, don't hand us over. They want to kidnap her. Her dad's a gangster, it's because of him. They might kill her. They are all gangsters. Let's go! - Hang on a second. - What do you mean? Drop it. What the hell are you doing?! Come on, I said. Crazy woman, what are you doing? Seifullin. Seifullin, where are you? Why are you always hiding? Didn't hear, didn't hear. I fell asleep in the barn. - The dog woke me up. - Seifullin, I'll lock you up one day. - You try hiding one more time. - I wasn't hiding! Chief, I've been... working all day. Sober as a judge. You should put something cold on it, like ice cream. Alexander Pavlovich! Some tea perhaps? Excuse me, mister, don't you have anything cold? I'll check. - Will this chicken do? - Yes. You're welcome. Mister, maybe we should take her to a doctor? Misters travel on the subway, carrying briefcases. Stay here and don't make a move. If you need something, tell him. Thank you. Sniper...! So, your dad's a gangster? Seifullin, be careful with them. Understood. Got it. - Take me to the village. - Get off! Let's go hither and thither! Sveta, do you think they'll pick us up soon? Definitely. I already want to go home. I know. Listen, maybe they've gone somewhere? What if we spend all our lives wandering around like this. We'll just ask that nice policeman, and he'll find them. - And if he doesn't? - He'll find them. He is a policeman, after all. So, you think all policemen are good? Depends on who you are. I don't get mixed up with them, so they leave me alone. I've noticed. Why has he taken us in, then? For money, most likely. To get money from your Dad. I know my Dad's a gangster. But he loves me. We are going skiing in Austria. Your dad dumped you, though. We don't know who has dumped who yet. What's wrong? My head hurts. You've got a fever. Get some sleep. Eat some. Where did you get the lipstick? Where did you get the lipstick? In the apartment where we hid the first night. - You mean you stole it? - Yes. What a family! Sveta, what do you want to be when you grow up? I don't know. I could become a bodyguard. My dream is that we grow up and become artists who perform. We'll perform the belly dance! Who are you? She got sick. Get out! - I'm the boss here! - She is sick. - It's mine! - Don't touch! - Well, give it back! - I'll call the police! What police? He told you to stay put, and not to make a move! Go and sleep in your barn! What are you doing? - What are you doing, huh? - Go! Go! - What? - Go to the barn and sleep! Is there a chemist's around here? That way. Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. - Where is Sveta? - She is sick. Her nerves probably. Has Dad phoned you? No. If he phones, tell him we're living here with an old man, near the dam. Aspirin, please, and something for nerves. You didn't notice the spikes? Where's the kid? I don't know. How much did Alik promise you? Tell the truth. You're greedy. I'll double it. Stubborn cop. Why are you so stubborn? Already got loads of money? Or bags of health? Out of the way! Where's the kid? Where's the kid?! Where's the kid?! Where?! It was a two! Two! Allah sees all! It was a four! Sveta, he's lying! Cheat! - I am a cheat? - You're a cheat, yes. - I'll tell Alexander Pavlovich! - Go ahead. He already knows I'm an honest man. - You're a rotten cheat! - Cheat, cheat! Let's play on. - Hello? - It's Alik. - Well? - I'm in place, tell Kostya. - Have you brought it all? - Yes. Right, we are on our way. Sveta, what are you going to do afterward? After what? Well, when you get home. Don't know. Keep training. And you? Maybe I'll go somewhere. - Let's go together. - Where to? How about India? We'll earn some money and go, together. They take in difficult children in Tibetan monasteries there. For starters, those are in China. Allah Akbar! Allah Akbar! Run! Run for it! Daddy! Be careful with this, there's glass items in there. You be careful out there on those skis. Stop it, Mom. I won't have time to ski. I've got to buy furniture, everything. New house. Understand? Have they finished the renovations? They said they have. I'll still have to double check. Though it is Europe, it's the same old story. Well, what about schools? Mum, they've got schools there too, it's not like it's the taiga! You put any food in it? 10 kilograms, enough for the trip. But where's Sveta? At the moment, about to go to training. Well, this is it. Sveta! We are going! Are you coming? Sveta... - So, good luck. - Bye. Are you coming with us? No. Here you go. Sveta, will we see each other again? Yes. Well... off to your training, or you'll be late. - I haven't got any training today.
