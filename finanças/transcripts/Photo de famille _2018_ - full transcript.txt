Didn't we want to meet? - What time is it? - 12:22 p.m. - Right. When will he be buried? - The party is at 1 p.m. I don't feel like it. Nobody wants to go to a funeral. - He always ate well. - Right, he did. - But he still died. - Yes, as if it were... It’s very sad. - And how is your mother doing? - So to some extent. Thank god she has your wife. She visits her often. - Ex wife. - Forgiveness? - My ex wife. - Oh yes. - It is also very sad. - Oh well... Hello mum. Are you all right? - Who is that again? - Your son. Pierre. Oh yes. She doesn't know you because you're never there - I beg your pardon? - You understood me. - She is senile. - Exactly, she is senile. You make it easy. - I'm going to the kids. - Yes do that. Take care of the eggs. Wait, can you... - Hello Tom. - Hi there. Hello dragon. Aren't the others there? Don't call me "dragon". I have nightmares. In it I grow everywhere Arms with claws, that shred everything I touch. - That sounds bad. - Yes. And when I speak, brown liquid runs out of my mouth. - Crap? - Yes exactly. It's like liquid shit. - Doesn't that bother you? - What? I call you from the bottom of my soul, Lord. Mr. Lord, hear me. Your ear hear the cries of my prayers. I want to settle on a green meadow. It should lead us to justice. We all have... We have all lost people. People go and we don't know why. The Lord is with us. He tells us... - Are you all right? - Great. ... cross the valley of death, I don't feel any pain. - Isn't Mao there? - I dont know. He comforted me. It is true... - All right, dad? Can you hold out? - Yes everything is good. Watch out. You crush Sandrine. - Excuse me. - It's okay. You will not go under! You keep going. The Lord is there for you, brother. - Hi there. - Hi there. - Are you feeling better? - Why better? Only like that. I just said that. Who is buried? Pierre? But no. Look, Pierre is behind you. We bury grandpa, your husband. Oh he's dead? The poor. I don't want to die here. I want to die in Saint-Julien. Are you three taking me there? I take care of the tickets. Grandma, come here. We have to keep going after the coffin. In the photo you are all three. When was it? Before the big bang? No, that was after. We were already scattered there. - That was... three years after the divorce? - Two. Why are you all in the photo? Because we're in Saint-Julien with Grandma. - It is summer. We wear shorts. - Right. Damn it! Wait, I'll do it. Excuse me. - Here, take the bread. - Thank you. - Is grandma finished? - No wait. She still has a kilo on the plate. She'll eat everything. If you take care of them, is she happy. I take care of you. What else should I do? I shop for them their lunch is brought. She is not a cat that you only feed. She is your mother. Yes, she is my mother. - Take care of yours. - You evade the way you always do. It's the same with the kids. Look at you what happened to your son. He draws on the table with pencils. Who are you talking about? Mao? Mao grew up with you. I'm here. I hear you. Everyone hears you. - He needs you. - You never said that. Yes, I have. But you didn't listen. Having fun with secretaries was more important to you than your children. Are we talking about the secretaries again? At father's funeral? We don't care about your father. Nobody liked the old bag. - She is no longer hungry. - What? Mother is no longer hungry. Sorry, grandma. I'm sorry. It's all good, darling. I thank you. Go ahead. - Yes! - But, mom! Gabrielle? - You look at me. - No, I'm not looking at you. Well, it's annoying when you look at me like that Are you all right? May I? - Here. - Thank you. - Did you hear what Grandma said? - No, what? That she wants to die in Saint-Julien. - Maybe we should do it. - What do you mean by that? Bring her to Saint-Julien to die. - Doesn't she want to die right away? - No I dont know. - I just wanted to talk about it. - She just said it like that. If she wanted to live in a yurt we wouldn’t get into it like that. - She forgets it anyway. - I'm not getting on. - Yes, you do. - No, that is not correct. I thought we could talk about it like adults. - I was wrong. - No. Let’s think about it. Forget it. It was stupid of me. I do not care. I take the garbage away. It is really neurotic. I didn't speak as a child. I wanted to annoy my mother with it. It was annoying. She always wanted to talk. She is a psychologist. Then I spoke to John my teddy. When he died, I talked again. When who died? - My Teddy John. - Teddies cannot die. Cuddly toys die in my family. We buried him in the garden with my mother. Your friend had a shovel. - Hi there. - Hi there. - Who else is coming? - Your mother. - No. - But. - Damn it. - Yes. I go take a shower. Don't let them make dinner. - Hello Tom. - Good evening. Are you alone? Isn't my dragon there? - She takes a shower. - I see. A patient brought me leeks. I'll make you a fondue out of it. - She wanted to cook something else. - Oh yes? I'll cook something for you anyway. That is impossible. - And? - It tastes really good. So you got the leek from a patient? - Yes exactly. - That will not do. You know that, don't you? - Of course you can. You can see that. - You are a psychologist. Exactly because of that. Some people are poor. You pay with what you have. Leek is leek. - You get paid for with vegetables. - I agree. And the patient with the vegetables always comes before you come to us. - I missed that. - Didn't you want to talk about grandma? But yes. I want to celebrate her birthday. She is alone, it would be great if we all came together. I don't really know. It is a very good idea. - When is it? On the seventh? - Sixteenth. Then on the sixteenth. Very good. By the way, I met Virginie Bateau. That's great. Who is Virginie Bateau? You were at elementary school together. I do not remember. - And further? - Nothing. We talked. Did you know that she is pregnant? No, I didn't know that there is Virginie Bâteau. Right, you said that. Well, I'm drying my hair now. - She is very tense. - It's all a bit much. The allium, Virginie Bâteau's pregnancy... - That was awkward. - Maybe. - Should I go to her? - No. We stay a bit longer then I will look after her. There you are. I found that in grandma's things. You painted the picture in Saint-Julien. You stopped talking. - Do you remember? - Yes, very well. It is you and dad. This is the Christmas tree. The black, crushed thing this is me. And mom burns in the fire. There is cake. Happy birthday Happy birthday Happy birthday, dear grandma Happy birthday Crap, I'll light it again. Let it blow the others. Let's go. Breath. Breath. You have to blow out the candles. You must... The cake. - Blow. - She doesn't want to blow. That brings misfortune. Grandma, blow. Look here. You blow. - All the best, grandma. - All the best. - I missed the candles. - It doesn't matter. A souvenir photo. Your grandmother has even at night, leave the house. I agree. She wanted to buy tickets to go to Saint-Julien. It was closed. That's why your father and I talked to each other. We actually did it. We have to find a solution. She can't stay alone it is too dangerous. Pierre, what do we do? We do what we said and done. - The kids don't know. - Not yet. - We have to tell them. - Say it. - No, that's your job. - Tell them what to say. It is closer to you. It is your task. You wanted to say it. So say it. - Emotionally, it's your job. - What's all this about? Do you want to put her in a home? - No. - But. - That's what it boils down to. - Yes. You want to expose them like a dog. - Don't talk like that. - I won't let that happen. - She will go there. - You're exaggerating. - Oh. - Excuse me. - She'll come off the track. - It already is. Are you here too Did you hear that? - Yes I have. - What do you think about? You talk about her as if she wasn't here at all. What do you say to that, Grandma? I'm glad to see you because we will go to Saint-Julien soon. Yes. OK. - We take turns taking them with us. - That's great. - Yes, we take turns. - That's not a good idea. - We have our own life. - Yes. - He does not. - What? That was a joke. She says you have no life. - This is a funny joke. - Forget it. Are you in? - No, I do not. - Why not? I don't have an apartment. I live with Stéphane. We won't... She is... No, I can't. But it's a great idea. You only think about yourself. It's true. He is becoming more and more an idiot. - He lives with an idiot. - Stéphane is not an idiot. He works, is reasonable. He doesn't juggle diabolos at the "Humanité" festival. Just listen to yourself. You were at the party with us! We are now relaxing and looking for a solution. - She comes to me first. - Then to me. - You do what you want. - Go then. - There is still cake, honey. - No thanks. Granny. Granny. Granny. Grandma, stay here. I'm almost done. Sit down and don't move. Wait for me. Don't move from the spot. Hi sweetheart. - What is this letter? - I do not know. - You read it. - He is from the youth welfare office. I've said it a thousand times: I want to see dad. - Hello, my big one. - Hello grandma. Sit down. Do you want to sort coins? Yes, thank you. You rush the youth welfare office on my neck? The counselor had the idea. She said what you experienced you'd never let me go What have i experienced Your mother left you. Your father never had time. You siblings have been separated. It didn't work with my father. You love nobody but grandma and me. The little one speaks well. - You do not understand this. - Oh well. - He wants to see his father, but the... - I do not know him. No, do not do that. And Solal doesn't know him either. He never lived with him. I was alone from the start. His father sees him for a few hours once a month. I'm always with him with my son, day and night. I took him to school every day and picked him up. From the beginning. I live for that. So that he has a regulated life, I’m here and I’m not moving. So he always knows where I am. They don't come anyway. So that you can take a shower. Where is she? - What are you doing? - I can't... I'm uncomfortable. Me too, but it can't stay that way. It is not dirty. No. Raise your arm. OK then. So. And now the other. Yes, that's a good thing. Now raise your arms. Is this what death looks like? - no? - I dont know. - Do you think that's funny? - No. I don't think it's funny. - are you not sick? - No. - But? - I do not know that. What do you think? I think no. It's the others who are worried. Why? Because I have problems. With the women. With the alcohol. With the family. With other people. And because sometimes you put yourself in danger. Nerd game, good day. Yes. The stack memory is totally overloaded. Therefore Kaïna turns in a circle. And it is eaten by the gorbos. You really have it. - Did you watch him? - Yes. - Does it bother me when I speak to you? - No. - I'm really trying. - Oh yes? - What's your name? - Candy. - My name is Candy. - How the cartoon series? - Are you named after it? - Yes. That's crazy. My name is Mao. - How in the "Cities of Gold"? - No. His name is Tao, my name is Mao, like the Chinese leader. - I see. - 65 million dead. Crazy what parents can do. - What can parents do? - What they can do. Really crazy. - Help. - What does he do? - Can I leave her here? - You go? - I have to work. Be careful - No, take it with you. - I have an appointment. - What appointment? - An appointment. - I understood that. Where? Forget it. I'm not going No, that's not the point. This is not a problem. - Just say where you're going. - I wanted to surprise you. Oh, now it's too late. - Say. - I have an appointment. I wanted to see a bigger apartment. In case we... have a child. - You know what? - That's great. Until then, Grandma lives with us. Exactly, we'll do that until then. Grandma, you come with me. The poor. Come along. What should i do with her Look, next to you. Yes, and now give up. Give up. It's dangerous here. Come here, give me your suitcase. What are you doing there? - I'm cleaning the windows. - Make sure you don't fall. - I'm holding on. - You have to take care of grandma. No. I said no. I said no. That will not do. - I can't take care of her. - Bye. Elsa, did you hear? - Gabrielle picks her up at 6pm. - No wait. Take them back with you. Hello Mao. Good day. I am Clara. I work with Mao. - I want to die in Saint-Julien. - Oh yes. I have to continue now. I thought it was great. I always put it on him. Why are you clearing the room? We do not know yet. First of all, it would be a vacant room. He wants to live with his father. - What a crap. - Do you keep that? Otherwise I throw it away. You like to throw things away. You threw our cat away too. It was completely crushed. Yes that's true. But it was a radical funeral. Elsa screamed. Tell me if you want to keep it. I just have to make room. Of course I understand that. I will keep it. - could you speak to him - With whom? - With Solal. - What should I tell him? - That he shouldn't go to his father. - Ah, he wants to see his father. - Let's end this here first. - That would be great. - Are you sure you have space? - Yes this is not a problem. - What is it? - Solal told me everything. - That he wants to see his father? - Yes. All boys are like that. That will pass. What does it do? Why are you so stubborn? If I tell you, you are offended. Not at all. Tell me. All right then. I would have wished, that my mother is stubborn. I would have loved to live with her. I would have loved to do that. - You see, you are offended. - I'm not. - Why is she offended? - She is not. Where's grandma Granny. Granny. Excuse me. It is absurd. - Why are you so angry? - You talk well. Everything is great with you. And for me it's called "Nullipara". That's just because we don't have children yet. My FSH is below average I have too much LH, my estradiol is almost zero. - The prolactin level is great. - It doesn't matter. Look at the bad progesterone level. She said, you have great ovaries. And beautiful fallopian tubes. Someone says whose sperm has 60% mobility an hour after ejaculation. Grandma, it's your turn. - What is this baryzentrum nonsense? - It's not nonsense. I discovered, that alcohol shows your bar center. - Yes. - Okay. When you drink... - When you're drunk... - Yes? If you act like you all is well. If you're completely different do you have a problem and... See who's coming. The queen of the evening. - The beautiful Clara. - I wanted to clink glasses with you. - To you of you. - To you of you. It was nice to work with you. - It'll be weird without you. - For me too. - bingo. - What do you think? - She cries. - Because she is sad. No, she cries because she is drunk - You do not have to cry. - It was so nice with you. I understand that. You have a master's degree in economics. - Do something better than an operator. - That's right but... - It was so nice with you. - It was nice, but... - Do you want chips? - You are so nice. It was really so nice with you. - It will be allright. - Yes. Why did not you call me? You never answer And I don't have a phone. Hi there. - I'll go then. - See you later. - Do you have to be so rude? - The guy annoys me. He is cool, looks good, is personable. - Right, just terrible. - Yes. Why are you here? If I should take care of grandma... Forget it. That's why I'm not here. Then why then? I would like, that you speak to Solal. Meet with him. Do boy stuff with him. I am not enough for him. It has to be a man. A male role model. I thought you... You could do that. And why don't you ask dad? You are right, I am asking dad. - Because he really likes you. - Yes he does. It will be again. What is Solal's problem? There is none. He is in puberty. He is ashamed of my work. That's all. - Why don't you do something else? - Sure, why not? I'm serious. Take a step towards him. We have just lost an operator. Can you answer the phone Look at your sister You must not. The tower goes straight. No, no, mom. We are playing. Here. Do you want it? I can put it here. Yes. But it is pointless. - Did she send you? - Who? - Mummy. - No. All the better. - Tell her I want to see dad. - Yes. We'll talk to her. Since Sandrine came you always say "we". - For real? - Yes. That is strange. - What week is she? - You're welcome? What week is Sandrine? - I heard you talk. - Ah. - You should tell the others. - I will do that. We are waiting for the right moment. - You said "we". - Right. - It'll hurt them. - No. Not necessarily. It's your turn. There are mixed toilets. All good? Did you settle in here? Yes everything is good. Can you wait till i finish Yes of course. That... sorry, I... I wanted... It doesn't matter. Not bad. - The door. - Yes, that's... It's not bad. Excuse me. Let's rake. Come on. What shoud that? We are not farmers. I don't rake. You rake or I rake on your head All right, calm down. All right. You rake when you are told. I don't want to hear anything anymore. Take it easy, you break everything. Who's reintegrating whom, Moussa? You me? Do I trade in grass? Do I steal bags? Do I shoot with real arrows? - Is that me? - All right, I'm raking. That's all. It should be easy for me it is not. - It's just not easy for me. - I know. So many women get pregnant unintentionally. We only had sex once. There was not even any penetration. There is always penetration. - I saw your sister. - I saw her too. I thought she hates me, but... - No. - Yes, she hates you. What has she got against me? I dont know. You symbolize something. The alienation of the people through capital. I am the people, you the capital. - Seriously? - Seriously. She doesn't hate capital that much. - She kissed me. - Yes exactly. We kissed. A real kiss. I swear. On the toilet. Did you kiss in the toilet? I'm trying to forget that. - You are offended? - Now I imagine it. - I imagine it figuratively. - I shouldn't have said anything. I hesitated. Where do you want to go to? - It is not bad. - I work, dear woman. I have to go back there. I understand that, but we had a stake. And she suddenly appeared in the middle of a scramble. It's like... Imagine it is burning. And a young woman hands her baby to the fireman. That makes work difficult. It was like this tonight only it was an older lady. - And it was not "handed over" to you. - No. - And you're not a fireman. - No. - And there was no accident. - He understood. What i tried To explain to you... What I have done, was a comparison. - How is this called? - An analogy. An analogy, exactly. I wanted you to understand that it's bad. You did that well. The paper is all I get a new pack. Sorry, stay seated. The chair has casters. You get around quite a bit. I get the paper. - What is he doing now? - He goes to get paper. - Ah? What does he need that for? - No idea for a report? Are you going to book Grandma? That would suit you. You are really funny. Incredible, how you cuddle up to the cops - An analogy. - I'm trying to fix things. You were irresponsible. She can't live with you it's not working. It is perfect... A place is free in Vitry. She is going there. We have no choice. She just wants to die in Saint-Julien. Yes, and what should I do? Waiting for day X there with her? All right, you want to get rid of them. I understand it. The home will be too expensive and you don't have the money. Mao has it. What? Mao will pay for it. - This is a joke. - He offered himself. Of course, we didn't decline. Yes, of course, he has coal. He doesn't care. I agree. That is why he will pay. - What an ass. - So please, dragon. - What an ass. - Hello, I brought paper with me. - Hello, Mr. Bronchard. - Hi there. This is the common room. Here people watch TV, read or play board games. Good day, ladies. They often want to stay in the room. I believe that. It is certainly not always easy. You are not... - Not all of them are waterproof. - I beg your pardon? I mean, they are old people. You have to come up with things to keep them busy. They're not animals. It’s not enough just to feed them. This is the form that you would have to fill out. You will be fine here. - Thank you. - Where exactly is that? Thank you. I'll be next door then. This doctor makes a nice impression. - This is Pierre, your son. - Oh, so much the better. - He seems nice. - He is very nice. You can live again. You have to fight. I count on you. Come on, make an effort. It's a plant, mom. She doesn't understand you. You have to talk to them. That helps them. That may be, but she is dead. Cheering them on doesn't make them alive. - Is something wrong? - But. I have a real job as you wanted it. I take a step towards you - I hope you recognize that. - I do. Thank you Mama. - Good. - I wanted to tell you something else. - What? - You will have a brother. But. - Are you waiting for the bus? - Yes. Should I take you on the scooter? No thanks. Good. - Go I said no. - Yes I have heard that. - I do not feel well. - Me too. It is not normal, to pounce on each other like this. - We are not animals. - No. I have to think about it all the time. I keep seeing it in front of me and me... Are you serious? I can't have a relationship right now. It's February 25th. First alcohol self-test. On video. First filmed alcohol self-test. The third glass should have an effect. I find my bar center. - After that did you throw up? - Yes. - Here you come back. - Yes, but I'm leaving. Now I'm staying a little longer. Here. - So? - No. Tell me. I found my bar center at the level of the toilet bowl. But it's less bad than the previous day. Heavy rains in Atlanta at 14 degrees. Waning winds in Cayenne at 31 degrees. I would have told you. Of course I would have said it. I was just waiting for the right moment. It just happened it wasn't planned or anything. Of course, it went by itself as if by magic. There was not even any penetration. The old are deaf anyway. Of course there was penetration, no other way to make children. I don't want to talk about penetration. Neither do I. And why you? Why Sandrine? - You have a new one every week. - It's over. You noticed that. Everything is so easy with her. I feel good. I arrived. - Do you know how old you are? - He's not that old. - Which side are you on? - I don't have to choose a page. He is 60. If everything goes well, he's dead in 20 years. Do you think he should be a father? - What's so funny? - Nothing. Maybe I don't have to die at exactly 80. And a baby is cute. DEATH IS DEAD DEATH FIGHTS A WOMBAT SENSE: DEAD WOMBAT: DEAD SENSE: DEAD She is dead. It is not dead. She sleeps. I know that you are not sleeping. Go ahead, I'll follow you. When talking, you should look at yourself. I'm already badly integrated, but with mom and chocolate croissant I am through. I quit my job. I don't want to be locked up. - Do you understand? - No. I agree, that you're moving to your father. - For real? - I talked to him about it. When? Whenever you want. OK. Thank you. Nothing to thank for. Hello grandma. You look great. - The little one slept here. - Mao? - Was he here? - Yes. That's great. You must have been happy. How are you? I'm afraid to die before the baby is born. - The baby? - I still have to buy tickets. No, stay seated. Which baby? Elsa? Surprise. May I come inside? Come in. - Do you want to talk? - No, I'm a little tired. This is normal in your condition. - what condition? - Is it a secret? - What are you talking about? - Nothing. - Isn't Tom there? - He went out. - Don't grin like that. We split up. - Why? - Therefore. - No, stick together. A new life starts. We cannot have children. Maybe. But we can't do it together. No baby wants to be born in this shit. The baby doesn't come because it knows that we don't want it. Give it back to me. - The? Why? - It's the wrong size. - It doesn't matter. - No stop. I'm so sorry. Your grandma told me. Excuse me. You really are... It's cute but it's really annoying. Papa is waiting downstairs. But... So what's going on? Hi there? What? No. - And? - She woke up. Isn't Mao there? I left 14 messages. - Did you speak to grandma? - Yes but... She is still pretty dazed. You will keep them here. She doesn't like it, but... She forgot to eat. That's why she fell. It was low in sugar. It is not so bad. I am on the bridge. I can not see you either. Where are you? Further down. Damn it. I see you, put your arm down. - I can't get up anymore. - Give me your hand. - How do you get there? - I do not know. - You do not know? - I fell on it here. I was lucky. - What shoud that? - did you jump? No, I must have stumbled. - You're an idiot. - What shoud that? I'm sick of you. I do not feel like it anymore. You wanna die Then die. It wasn't an intention. Stéphane. I go. I'll go before you go - You are leaving me? - Yes. - I do not want that you leave. - But. You want that. That's exactly what you want. - But now I'm making the decision. - Do not you love me anymore? - But. - Then don't leave me. - Bear me. - No. Don't leave me in that cart. I'll leave you where I can It is Mao. Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. - My pleasure. - Is everything ok? - Yes. - Thank you. - My pleasure. - Tom just left me. - Crap. - Are you all right? - Yes. - Why not? - Because Tom left you. I see. Yes, it's better that way. It no longer worked between us. - Okay. - Have you been on the floating dock for a long time? I do not know it anymore. But a whole night. - Should I take you with me? - No. I'm walking. I'm a little tense. - What is? - Nothing. You should be dead and you're just a little tense. I do not wanna die. I just fell. - So. - See you. Grandma is in the hospital. Good day. I'm looking for Mrs. Sorel. - Room six. - Thank you. Gladly. - Hi there. - Hi there. - Has she been sleeping for a long time? - A quarter hour. Is your father doing well? It works. I don't see him often. The caretaker is nice. Call your mother That would do you good. My mother is not good for anyone. I'll tell you something. You know when she was little she moved. - No childhood stories. - You moved with Elsa to my father. - She didn't know anyone in the new school. - And? She presented herself as the class representative. It was chosen she didn't get a single voice. She didn't know anyone either. It had zero votes. She didn't even vote for herself. I understand, but the person who lives in you doesn't want anything bad to you. OK. And what's so bad? You have to come back again. Goodbye. What don't you want to do - Are you paying with it? - I beg your pardon? You pay for the session with vegetables. No. No, I pay with money. Well, check your calendar. Naturally. - It would be easier to smoke again. - Are you crazy? Cigarettes are poison. And hop. - I don't know why I'm here. - I know the sentence. I am not a patient. I want to speak to my mother. I am doing very well. No, that is pathetic. Everything i say you must have heard a thousand times I can't talk to you. - It's annoying when you listen to me like that. - Then I'm not listening. I have this anger in me. I wonder where it comes from. I have the impression, that we are all scattered. Do you understand? I would like, that we're all together. Then I can find peace. I... had so many mothers. I was attached to them. But they were only interested in him. He was behaving impossible. They left him and it started with a new one. Only grandma stayed. I have to take time off. I'm taking her to Saint-Julien. I'm not offering you to come with me. No, do not do that. Hi there. Hi there. Mao didn't come today. - I know that. - Okay. It's good that I see you. I wanted to see you. - Let's not stay here. - Yes, we stay here. - We don't touch like that. - Ah. You see if we don't touch nothing remains. Nothing happens. That means we are not in love. I'm not totally in love with you. That's the evidence. You come to tell me that? You tell all men you are not in love with that you are not in love You tell the baker in the morning the guy on the metro. The newspaper seller? Japanese tourists? No? Then don't do it now. It's very uncomfortable. It is hurtful. That's true. I'm really sorry. It is probably up to my sisters. What is it about your sisters? That I am unable to live normally. Keep talking. I remembered that I loved my sisters very much. I forgot it, it occurred to me again. I really liked her but I never saw her. I saw her in Saint-Julien in the summer. - I waited. - What were you waiting for? For the summer. On Saint-Julien. I got you a warm meal. You must eat. I'm not hungry. Thank you. I already know, that it's not very funny here. Give your best. Family is not my thing. Be a father, be a son, I'm not good at that. I know that with the kids... Screwed up. You should have told me. It was good what you did. You took all three in the summer. It is important, very important. I was busy with my stuff. The work, the women. Time flies by. You wake up one morning and you're old. You can't do the simplest things anymore. We both never really talked to each other. I know, it is not easy for you. I would like, that you recognize me It is not bad. But eat. Please eat. Relax yourself. Find your breathing. Focus on what you want to say with the body. I am concentrating, but everything becomes deaf. - We could... - You can't talk. Okay, I'm not talking. Look here. I see for the first time what you see. - I want to move. - I believe you about that. No, I really want to move. - I want to change my life. - Ah, you want to change your life. Yes. Me too. - Do you still want to go to Saint-Julien? - Yes I would like to. You won't die there immediately. - That's not bad. - Yes, it is. Why? - It will cause us grief. - Oh, that. Yes, that. I want it anyway. Hi there. Hi there. - Aren't you dressed up? - No. I think, what else I could do. Maybe something more mobile? Now that you're tall. I am glad that you are here. - You can always come back. - I know. A tooth has failed. Do you want him? Yes. I'm gonna go, then. No kiss. D rather not. But we can do that. - That's how you do it in the United States. - Ah. Can we do it again? Thank you. See you. Yes. - Hi there. - Hi there. - This time I'm here for Mao. - He is not there. Wait. - Ah, hello. - This is Gabrielle. This is my brother Philippe and his wife Tiphaine. - Shall we have a drink? - Yes. Here's something. It's always the same with construction workers. They hit you over the ear wherever they can. You don't get a cent until the cable ducts are finished. He immediately sees that I have no idea. It is always the same. He doesn't see a cent before... And all the dust. It's really annoying. He immediately sees that I have no idea. It takes weeks to clean it up. Gabrielle is Mao's sister. - Now I understand. - What do you understand? They are both somewhat special. And what about the cable channels? Do you know my brother well? - What was your first name again? - Philippe. Her parents weren't very original in naming. - You're welcome? - Do you have only one brother? Or is there another one the name of Thierry? The dog's name is Bello. - The cat's name is Pussy. - I'm getting fruit. Oh yes, fruit is good. Unfortunately, I will have to say goodbye. Until then, Thiphou. Until then, Philou. I take her to the door. Even drunk, I think you're great. Gabrielle? Hi there. What are you doing here? I have been waiting for you. Why don't you go up Come over. No. There are very strange people up there. You're drunk. Careful, slowly. Come lets go. No wait. We give him money. - Come over. - Wait. There she is. Look here. - She's not feeling well. - It's at the limit. I am so happy to see you. - I love you. - Yes? - Yes. My little sister. - Attention. My little sister. Did you sleep? - Yes. - We are here to see you. - Let's go to the sofa. Come over. - Come on. - Did I tell a lot of crap? - No. Yes, and you cried a lot because of the crepes. - You always screw it up. - Not always. And you said... No, you screamed... That you love us - That's true. - No, it's starting again. But it's true. You are... Now she will burst into tears. No, I will not burst into tears. - You are... - What are we? I can't remember anything in front of you. And nothing without you. I only remember Saint-Julien. We always looked forward to it. She was still small and could hardly write. She skipped the days on the calendar like a prisoner. - That's true. - There you have it. I knew it. No I'm sorry. I had completely forgotten that. We have to do it. We have to go to Saint-Julien. - Oh, it's all spinning. - Wait, take this. Here. - Are you all right? - Hi there. - I introduce you to the colleagues. - Let's go somewhere else. There is not much here. But the canteen is good. - Have you never been here? - No. You'll see, it is really good. - I have no... - No, just go. Do you see. - It's good, isn't it? - Not bad. Who was the big one that you introduced me to? - That was Dumas. - Dumas? - Yes. - Okay. It was that. I have a mission. - What does this mean? - I have to talk to you. - Is it something bad? - No. - Oh God. - But it is important. - Hello, Pierre. - Bernard. - All good? - This is my son Mao. - Ah, I'm glad. - Me too. I've heard so much about you. - You are confusing something. - No. He's doing video games, isn't he? Yes exactly. But we are several. I know, he showed me the website. - I think that's great. - Thank you. Gladly. You always wonder how they do it. - Yes. - I learned something. - Okay, see you. - See you. - See you soon, my boy. - Yes. Bernard is nice. Very, very nice. - You showed him the website? - Yes. - Shouldn't I have done that? - But. Papa, we're going to Saint-Julien with Grandma. Gabrielle and Elsa come too. We wanted to take the baby with us but it is not there yet. So we didn't do everything wrong. No, not everything. Try the yogurt. It tastes very good. - When do you drive? - Friday. - What if they don't let her go? - We have a plan. - What are you going to do there? - Nothing special. To be there. Be there together. - How long will you stay? - We do not know. Let's see. - Do you know where you sleep? - No. - no? - No. - Do you do something like this for me? - What? Like this. No matter what. Of course we do. - Yes? - Yes, don't worry. Stand up. You are crazy. Excuse me. - Quick, room six. - What? Stay here. Here.
