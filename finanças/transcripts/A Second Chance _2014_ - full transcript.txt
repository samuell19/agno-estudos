A FILM BY SUSANNE BIER A SECOND CHANCE - 205? - 205. Shut up! Shut the fuck up! - Shut up! - You're so fucked up! Fucking... Get in there! Sit down! - What? - Tristan? Shit. You...? - Did you call the fucking cops? - They're not coming in here! - Tristan! - Are you happy now? Tristan, let's talk. What are you doing out here in the country? I live here. What are you doing here? - What are you on? - Nothing. Get the fuck out. - Fucking faggot. - Jesus Christ. Did the gnome next door call you? He plays video games all night long. He didn't do anything. Fuck off! Don't break my fucking door! - Sit down and relax! - You broke my door, man! What the fuck? Have you got a search warrant? What have you got in there? Move! Christ! Get into the kitchen and stay there. - You're in my home. - Sit! - Call in Social Services. - Show me your warrant. - Sit down. - The police broke into our home. Andreas! - Tristan, stay down. You hear me? - I've got him. Fuck! That hurts! - Is it your baby? - It's mine too! Fucking cunt! You have a kid, Tristan? What a fucking joke. There now... Come here, little man. Come up here. - Give him to me. - Sit down. - Give him to me. - Sit down! - Name? - Sanne. Sanne. Why the hell did you have a baby with that psycho? - What's it to you? - You shoot up too? No. - Is the baby on methadone? - No. - Sure? - Yes. He's freezing cold. Put some damn clothes on him. - Give him to me! - Do you breastfeed him? No. - Have you got any formula? - Tristan drank it. - Shut the fuck up! - Christ. Give him to me. Give him to me. I know, it's not nice at all. Give him to me. - Hi. - Hi, darling. Nice. Hello there, little man. - Why did you call? - You're so strong. - It was stupid of me. Sorry. - It was strange, that's all. We got called out, and it was a guy I arrested back in Copenhagen. Tristan. A mean son of a bitch. It turns out he has a baby boy. The kid was covered in his own shit and piss, freezing cold. And then, well... I just had to call you. Yes, I did. You're falling asleep. Beautiful boy. Are you grumpy, huh? I'll take him for a drive. Let me take him. - Do you want me to come? - No, get some sleep. I'll find your pacifier. There you go. There now. We'll just go for a drive, and you'll fall asleep. The child is not malnourished, it's healthy, so we can't remove it. The place was a goddamn dump. They're junkies. Her drug test was negative. - Why weren't we told Tristan was out? - His address is the Varebro Park. They can't help it if he moves here. Had they known, they'd have informed us of his three-year parole. - We should be informed. - He's not a registered parent. - But he is. - Probably couldn't pay child support. This is how he treats his girls. He needs to go to jail, and that child should be removed. - He's a psycho. - Book him, or he'll kill them both. Andreas. Did Simon leave already? It's his son's birthday. They're going out with Trine and her new husband. - Jesus. How will that go? - We'll see. Come on, man! Hey! Mind if I have a drink? What the hell are you doing? Hey, it's a sweet deal. You get to launder your money... ...and I get a free drink. Sweet deal. Isn't it? Isn't that a sweet deal? Do you know these guys are all homosexuals? Oh, really? - Yes, really. What's your name? - Pamela. Pamela, they're all homosexuals. You should charge them extra. - Fuck off. - I just want a drink, that's all. - Let me take him for a drive. - No, I'll take him for a stroll. - I'll take him for a drive. - No, you need to sleep. - Yes? - Andreas? - Who's this? - Klaus from Dollhouse. Simon is shit-faced and he's causing a scene. - I have to go. It's Simon. - Can I come? Great idea. You and Alexander at a strip club. I'll be back soon. - What's your problem? - That your mom's a whore! Stop! Sit down, all of you! Okay? Enough! - I've got him. - Hey, let's grab a drink. This place is a mess, Simon. Why don't you get a stove? I don't cook. You can't have Albert over in this dump. Albert doesn't come over. He's got that swimming teacher now. How was dinner? Did you say something stupid? No, no. I sat there for hours on end, smiling... Being friendly to the swimming teacher. We agreed on small gifts, and then they give him an iPhone. I gave him a pair of goalkeeper gloves. And so what? Stop feeling sorry for yourself and drink your coffee. What kind of a job is that anyway? Anyone can teach swimming. Simon... Simon, get some sleep. Hell, I can become a swimming teacher, if that's what she wants. - I can splash around from 9 to 5. - You can get three hours of sleep. You need to get it together, okay? And lay off the booze a little. Let's go to the island for a couple of days. To my mom's cottage. I need the toilet. And then I want a glass of milk. Look. This is crazy. He can wear this for his confirmation. Perfect. Trust Morn to send stuff rather than actually showing up. - Is he asleep? - Yes. I can't believe he's here. That we have him now. I haven't really grasped it. Oh, I think he's pretty good at making his presence known. Do you regret it? What makes you say that? I love him more than anything in the world. - What makes you say that? - Anna! I just meant that it's been harder than we expected, that's all. I'm sorry. - I'm almost ready here. - I have to feed Sofus. Don't touch him. He's fine there. I mean it. Leave him. - He's gonna start crying. - He's fine there. Hear anything? - I'm gonna pick him up. - Sanne, for fuck's sake. Put him down. Sanne. Come here. - He's hungry. - What the fuck is it you don't get? - I have to feed him. - Oh, you have to feed him? Did I tell you to go out here? Did I, huh? You hear me? Give him to me. There now, don't be afraid. Nothing to be afraid of. There now. Don't cry. Stay there. Stay. I mean it. There now... - Come on. - Let me... Come on. Let's go. Down! - Stay there! - I don't want any. Stay! You hear me? Stay or I'll fucking smack you. There... Stay! Wake up. Wake up. Please. Wake up! Wake up. No! Wake up! - Wake up. - Anna? - No! - Anna? No! Anna? Move! Do something. Do something. Do something! Call an ambulance. Anna, call an ambulance. If you call, they're going to take him away. - He's dead, Anna. - Why would you say that? - You're sick. - He's dead. We have to call. We have to call. Don't you call them. I have to call. No! No! I have to call them. If they take him, I'm going to kill myself! Anna, come here. Anna, come here. - No! - Sit down! - Don't call them. - No. If they take him, I'll kill myself. I'll kill myself. I mean it. - I mean it. - I know. Come on. Please. Please. Eat. Eat a little. Anna? - Please. - You have to sleep, darling. Just take these pills. They'll help you sleep. - There. - Thank you. There. - Don't call them. - I won't. Go to sleep. - You won't call them, right? - I won't call. I promise. Thank you. He won't eat. My little baby. Alexander? It's not Alexander. It's another baby. - Alex... - It's not him. I... I took their child. The couple I told you about. Tristan. I left Alexander there. Hook him. - I want Alexander. - He's dead. - Where is he? - He's dead. He's dead, Anna. We don't have a child anymore. We don't have Alexander. Not anymore. I want Alexander. Where is he? Where is he? Hello... Sofus. Sofus? Sanne! Sofus? Sanne! Sanne! Come here. Sanne, now! Sofus. - Relax. - Pick him up. - Check if he's breathing. - Of course he's breathing. - Is he breathing? - What did you do to him? Is he fucking breathing? Is he breathing? Check if he's breathing. You fucking killed him. Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck. We're both going to jail. This isn't fucking happening. Fuck, fuck. Fuck! There now. It's not fair. It's not fair that we lose Alexander, while they get to destroy him. You can't bear to lose a child, Anna. I already did. Alexander is still dead. Darling... You said you were going to kill yourself. You said you were going to kill yourself. When I met you, you said that all you wanted was a child. He's ours now. Simon? I need your help. Call me as soon as you get this. Hi, Simon. What? No, everything's fine. What? That message you left. You sounded like you'd seen a ghost. Oh... Everything's fine now. Sure? Is Anna okay? Alexander? - Everything's fine. - Sure you don't want me to come over? Sofus isn't dead! - What the fuck? - He's not dead! - Shut up. - Sofus isn't dead! No! Listen to me! If you scream again, I'll slit your throat. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? That's better. There... - This isn't Sofus. - Shut the fuck up. They look different when they're dead! - It isn't Sofus! - Listen to me! I'm not going back inside. Not because of you, you hear? We're gonna do this. I've got a plan. I've got a plan. And we're going to follow it. Trust me, baby. Okay? Let go of him. Let go. Come on, baby. Good, baby. - What? - They haven't reported it yet. - Why not? - Because they don't care, Anna. - They're probably still high. - Somebody's going to find out. There's nothing to find out. They'd never suspect us anyway. There you go. The perfect crime. It's not a crime. A crime is to let someone like Tristan destroy a child. That's a crime. We're going to save him. I know it's hard to understand right now, honey, but we are. Damn! Hi, Simon. - Can I come in? - No. We're on our way out. - You sounded strange - Everything's fine. - The hell it is. I can tell. - Just go. No way. I've never seen you like this before. It's Anna. She's not doing well. - I have to go back inside. - Sure. Okay. - See you. - Just say the word, okay? Did you tell him there was something wrong with me? Did you? Why the hell did you say there's something wrong with me? - Sorry. - Don't say that! There's nothing wrong with me! It's you! It's you. Anna? We could ask your parents to come and help. - They still wouldn't come. - No. I have to go to work tomorrow and find out why they haven't reported it. So Alexander is just lying there. I wish I could do this. I'm not meant to be a mother. - Don't say that. - I don't think I am. I miss Alexander so much. So do I. Hi. Let's turn you around, so you can take a little nap. How about a little nap? Excuse me. Got a light? Thanks. Yes. What? From who? No way! No fucking way! Hey! - What's going on? - He ran off with Sofus! My son! Call the cops! Stop! Come back! Look, I have to ask. Is Anna okay? - What's up? - Drop it, Simon. Calling all cars. An infant has disappeared from a playground. - A possible kidnapping. - Car 5, we're on our way. Good morning. We've sealed off the area. They think he took off that way. - Was it their baby? - Call off the search. Right, Tristan? - What? - There's no need for it. He won't believe anything I say. I was talking on the phone, when some guy ran up and took off with my son. I got them to call you and chased him to a parked car. He took off before I could see its plates. He looked Eastern European. - Oh, come on. - Wait here. Look at me, Sanne. - Look at me. Where's Sofus? - Somebody took him. - Where is Sofus? - Somebody took him, for fuck's sake! Somebody took him? Or maybe you forgot him somewhere. Tristan, come here. I know you're lying. For your own sake, what did you do with the baby? - Would I lie about my own son? - For your own sake: Where is he? - I'm telling you... - What did you do with him? What's your fucking problem? Calm down! - Sorry. - What the hell got into you? It's just too absurd to be true. - We can't be sure. - He's lying. I know he's lying. Take it easy. Let's bring her in. I can break her in two seconds. Sanne, does Tristan know? What did you do with him? Sanne, I'm getting sick of this. He wasn't kidnapped. We're not idiots. You're lying through your teeth. Where is he? What did you do to him? Is he dead? Did you kill him? - He isn't dead. - Okay, so where is he? He isn't dead. - What did you do to Sofus? - It's not him. - What did you do to Sofus? - It's not him. I don't get it. It's not him? So who was it? - Who was it then? - Look, we know you didn't hurt Sofus. If something happened to Sofus, it may not be your fault, but if you let Tristan do something stupid with him, we can't help you. You think people like me shouldn't have kids, and that I'm a bad mother... ...but I've never ever hurt him. Yes, I think you're a bad mother and people like you shouldn't have kids. You can rot up in jail for all I care. And you will. I'd know if he was dead. He isn't dead. - Hi. - Hi. Wow. I wouldn't want my parents to come for Christmas if the food wasn't perfect. This is like a test run. Cheers. - You must be hungry. - Sure. Sit down, let's eat. Hello there. - You're awake? - Andreas. We're going to make this work. I'm sure we will. Anna? Anna? What's going on? Is something wrong? Please take him. - What? - Take him. He mustn't get cold. He kept crying, so I picked him up. - I'm going to call... - No, he's going to be ill. Take him. Take him. Please. He can get sick. - Take him. - Okay. Calm down now. Take him into the truck. Take him. I'm going to get him out of the cold, and then I'll take you home. - Yes? - Yes. Thank you. Help! Shit! Hello. Hello. Who's this? What? And then suddenly I'm holding the kid... ...and when I turn around... ...she runs across and jumps over the railing. She's down there. She asked me to get the baby out of the cold. Have you found her? Thanks for coming. He's in the bedroom with the baby. Look, Andreas, I never know what to say at times like this. I'm really sorry about Anna. I'm really sorry, Andreas. It's almost as if he knows. The look in his eyes has changed. Go, Simon. Go. Get out! - Just go. - Alright. Go! No matter what I'm here for you, if you need me. There, there, sweetheart. There, there... Little darling... ...there now. They're here. Come in. I'm sorry for your loss. We're all crushed. - Would you like some milk? - No, thank you. Ingrid and I thought a wood coffin might be nice. - But it's up to you. - Of course. Cookies, anyone? Or maybe white. Maybe white is more common in Denmark. - Both will do just fine. - You decide. As for hymns and flowers, we don't remember whether Anna had a favorite flower. But Ingrid loves lilies, perhaps we could go with those? - Do you want me to take him? - No. He's so big. - We should have come sooner. - Yes. I think you should take a couple of weeks off, at least. There must be a lot of practicalities to sort out. Simon, partner with Thomas, and you go home and recover... I prefer Andreas. He knows how to tackle Sanne and Tristan. I am ready. It would mean a lot to me, finding that baby. The cameras didn't pick up anything. You're the only one who saw a man take off with your baby. - You can't even describe him. - I've described him like 20 times. 20 different men except for a guy with a peg leg! What is it that don't you understand? I know nothing! I'm the victim here! - Fucking find him! - We will. And then... ...you're going back inside. - You already made up your minds. - Shut up. Sanne told us everything. The hell she did. What did she say? You're lying! The police aren't allowed to give false information. She said you found him dead on the bathroom floor. She said you panicked and took off with him. Where did you take him? She said you killed him. Where is he? Come on, Tristan. Come on. Okay, here's the deal. I've been trying to protect Sanne. I go to the bathroom in the morning, just after I wake up, and there he is, Sofus, dead in the bathroom. I swear. I didn't do anything. - Tell us what you did next. - Not until Sanne says I didn't do it. If she said I did, she's lying. I'm not going to jail for something I didn't do. How the hell did you know about the bathroom floor? I took a wild guess. Hello. Can we have five minutes alone with her? Of course. Shut the door behind you, please. How are you? Sanne, Tristan admitted that Sofus is dead. It's not him. Tristan said you held the dead baby for hours and said: "What have I done?" What did you do, Sanne? How did Sofus die? - How, Sanne? - It's not him. People look different when they're dead. That just how it is. Sanne, nothing's going to happen to you. Just tell us the truth. I don't know where he is. Tristan buried him. Did he say where? Where? Where did he bury him? Where did he bury him, Sanne? Do you want to know what they do to child murderers in prison? They pour boiling water on their crotches. Sanne, look at me. Don't say any more. You'll get out soon. Mom? - What's up? - I have to go out for a while. - I've got some work to do. - Sure. I'll take him. Thanks. Police. I need to speak to a patient, Sanne Thomsen. - One moment. - Thank you. I need to speak to Sanne Thomsen. - Now? - Now. She's asleep. Sit down. I want him back! - Calm down. - I want him back! No, don't! He's not dead! Sofus isn't dead. Leave me alone! Here's the syringe. - Sanne... - I want him back! I want him back! Well, Tristan. How are you doing? - You're in deep shit. - Just tell us, Tristan. What did you do with Alexander's body? - Who the hell is Alexander? - Sofus. If what the both of you said is true, you were victims of sudden infant death syndrome. It's not your fault. But we have to do an autopsy on the body. Otherwise you'll be convicted of murder. It's up to you. Think, Tristan. I took the kid to the forest. - Where? - I took him to the forest. I just took a bike and rode off. Seriously, I don't know where exactly. What? You don't know where you buried your son? I was high, okay? I'll show you where, if I can. What the hell do you want me to do? Let me just say one thing first. Can I say one thing first? Sanne did this. I think she strangled him. She tried to many times. I tried to stop her so many times. It's not like she wanted to kill him. She never should've had that baby. Doesn't even use fucking protection. I mean, she's a hooker, you know? And now she killed my little boy. Now she killed my little son. Andreas! Andreas, stop! Andreas, stop! - Go home. - I'm sorry I lost it. Go home... ...take a sleeping pill and get some sleep like normal people. And talk to someone. Other than your mother! Go home. Simon will handle it from here. Everyone will understand. And for fuck's sake see a shrink! In light of the evidence, Tristan Markussen will be remanded for another four weeks. Four weeks for something I didn't do? Sanne did it! Tristan, apart from this case we seized over a kilo of heroin. At my place? No, at my fucking aunt's! I don't know what Kirsten is up to! And a loaded weapon with your prints at your residence. You stand to get six years on that count alone. Tristan Markussen will be kept in remand for another four weeks. - Fucking cunt! - Take the defendant away. - I found something. - Keep an eye on him. Someone dug here. Recently. Andreas, it's Simon. We found the body. I'll call you tomorrow when we get the autopsy report. Andreas, are you there? Andreas, are you there? Andreas? Good morning. Dike. You're early. Do you want me to come back later? - No, no. There are no visible external injuries, but the CT scan and X-rays revealed a lot. This is the infant's head. Fresh hemorrhages from a subdural hematoma. Very evident here. - See? - Sorry? There are hemorrhages under the dura mater. There's also a hygroma or a fluid accumulation, which is a result of one or more previous hemorrhages. But this fresh hemorrhage is what killed the infant. I have a picture of the torso. These rib fractures are very characteristic of intentional shaking. The perpetrator shakes the infant vigorously. This is a case of shaken baby syndrome. I'm not the police, but this is a murder case. Andreas. Andreas. What the hell are you doing here? Why are you sitting here? Have you been inside? You're bleeding. What did you do to your hand? What's going on, Andreas? I know this is hard for you. I just want to help you. Andreas, damn it! Fuck off! Hello, darling. Andreas? What's going on? What are you doing? - What are you doing? Your hand... - Mom, sit down. - What happened... - Stop! Andreas, tell me what's going on. Andreas! - What did you do to Alexander? - Who the hell is Alexander? - Sofus. - It's not him. I'd know if he was dead. He isn't dead. Hey there. What did you say? There you are. You're so beautiful. If you want to get rid of me, you'll have to punch a lot harder. Where's Sofus? I should have figured it out sooner, but the idea was just too insane. I thought it was the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do. Of course it wasn't the right thing to do. How was I to know that Anna... ...when I'd wake up to his screams at night, he was screaming for help. He was screaming for help, and I... Everyone will understand what you did, but he has to go back to his mom. She'll never get out of it. He will be put into care. Either way, there's nothing you can do. It's out of your hands. You'll be fired, but you won't have to go to prison. All the mitigating circumstances. They'll give you a suspended sentence. I have to tell her myself. Take me to her. Sofus. Hello, sweetie. Sanne, I'm sorry. Are you lost? No. My mom forgot screws. I got a hammer. I can't get it out. What's your name? Sofus. Are you sure you're not lost? I work here.
