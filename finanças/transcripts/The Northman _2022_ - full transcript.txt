Hear me, Odin. The Old Father of the gods. Summon the shadows of ages past. When the thread-spinning Norns ruled the fates of men. Hear of a prince's vengeance quenched at the fiery Gates of Hel. A prince destined for Valhalla. Hear me. The North Atlantic 895 A.D. He's here! He's here! Mother! Father is here! Never enter my chambres without invitation! The king, my lady! The king! Come! Odin brought him home. Hail, Raven King! Hail, war ravens! Hail, my Lord! War ravens, hail! Hail, ring holders! On my brother! Come on! Hail, King Aurvandill War-Raven! Hail! Like a battle dog returning to his master. I've come to be fettered by my Queen's fair locks. Ever I will be proud, my Lord. Prince Amleth. You have grown too old to be greeted as a child. Hail, Lord King! But... a father never grows too old for a good smothering. How I've missed you, my son! Will your brother not grace us with his presence? Think none of Fjölnir. He'll soon be with us. This was worn around a princess's neck when I found it. But it was destined for this prince. Wear it always with my love. Thank you, father! My King! - Fjölnir. - Fjölnir is back. The rough man is back. Hail, Lord King! Furnish this fierce heart and slayer of men with some drink. And I might drink to him. Accept my cup, kinsman! Lady! Look how the Queen's cup grows wet for more men than her king. What metal might buy a fragrant sip? Sweet silver? Or hot iron? Silence, dog! By Freyr, you slander your Lord and mistress... Please, you brother! 'Tis but a jest! A jest! Heimir keeps a foul tone, yet I keep him as a deep, sworn friend. Come, brother! This one's more in need of your safekeeping than myself. Thorir. Thorir! My son! - To my brother, the War-Raven! - To the Kingdom of Hrafnsey! - Skol! - Skol! The enemy has a taste of my liver. Are you hurt? Almost enough. Fjölnir must not be my successor. I watched his innocence tonight. He must be awoken to what awaits him. He is a puppy. Yes, the same age as my grandfather when he took the throne. That was different. He had to kill his uncle first. You have not seen your Queen in a season. Come. Let me take you to our bed. No. Pray my luck-spirits send me to many warfields after I defeat this wound. I refuse to die in sickness nor live the long life of a shameful greybeard. I must die by the sword. I will die in honour. Fret not! You will die in battle, my Lord! The Gates of Valhalla await you, I know it. This is the same path I walked with my father. And he with his. Now, it is a hard path to walk. Be not afraid, Amleth! Do as I do. Who barks? Is it the wolves of the High One? Or is it the barking of the village dogs? Barking to me, you two little dogs! You two are in deep need of knowledge. To learn what it is to live and die in honour. To be in battle, slain. And in death, rewarded by the Valkyries in graves. The war you make will carry you to the secret Gates of Valhalla. You are dogs that wish to become men. Prove you are not a dog! Not only are you a man, you dine like a king. And you little cub. What are you? I smell a class of people. And every passage, one should turn his eye around. One should fly around. For the foe might be crouched with evil on the floor. Why do you think that they should teach you how to be wise enough? To be unfooled. - Wise enough to be unfooled. - Tell me. How did Odin lose his eye? To learn the secret magic of women. Never seek the secrets of women, but they're helpless. It is that women may know the mysteries of men. The Norns! They spin and weave. And they're aware of Fate. - Live in honour. - Live in honour. - Safeguard your family blood. - Safeguard your family blood. Do you know what that means, Amleth, son of Aurvandill? Should I fall by the enemy's sword, you must avenge me or forever live in shame! I will, father! I will! My blade will not rest until the time it drinks blood from his neck! And live always without fear! For your fate is set and you cannot escape it. Swear to it! I swear! This is the last tear you will shed in weakness. It will be given back when most you need it. Now, behold as a man! Approach, Amleth! And in our blood, behold the trees of kings. Father! Run! Run! Run for where you cowardice belongs! You behold your brother's gaze in amazement. I knew well you would. Pity you never paid a bastard's-eyes heed before. Now, behold how swiftly your brother swings his sword! Strike, brother! Strike! But know that bearing a stolen ring makes no half-breed a king. Soaked in my blood, which will soon be sliding off your arm like a serpent. Your kingdom will not last. Let this misdeed haunt your living nights. Till a flaming vengeance scorches on your death. Strike! Strike! To Valhalla! King Aurvandill is dead! - Long live King Fjölnir! - Long live King Fjölnir! Hail, Lord King! Hail, Lord King! Bring me the boy's head! Disperse! Go right! - I'm on it! - Over there! Cut it off! I'll make it slow. Hail, Fjölnir the Brotherless! - Hail, King Fjölnir! - Hail, King Fjölnir! Hail, King Fjölnir! King Fjölnir has found himself a queen. Fjölnir! Fjölnir! My Lord! The boy... The boy... The boy is dead. Dead in the sea. Sank like a stone. I will avenge you, father! I will save you, mother! I will kill you, Fjölnir! I will avenge you, father! I will save you, mother! I will kill you, Fjölnir! I will avenge you, father! I will save you, mother! I will kill you, Fjölnir! I will avenge you, father! I will save you, mother! I will kill you, Fjölnir! The Land of the Rus Years Later The Father of War commands you! Transform your skin, brothers! Slaughter-wolves, Berserkers, become your fury! To Valhalla! What are you doing? Come on! Come on! Come on! Get in there, you old... These savages make for a fine chaplain. And you Björnúlfur, you did good. Never better. When we found you as a cub... I knew then that you have a heart of cold iron. Oh, weak! I am the strong one! The great one! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Play, you idiot! Play! Crawl in shadows, slayer of my people! Hide! Even though your brother stole my eyes... I see you. I am no one's brother. It is not enough to be the man that never cries. Prince Amleth! The prince that ran from his fate. A beast that cares for no one. A beast that runs tears from eyes of men. Now, remember for whom you shed your last teardrop. Remember the oath to right the wrong. Remember the Raven King. Remember. Remember. It contains the salty ocean you must be upon. To the edge of the World. It feeds the freezing river of hate that runs in my veins. It will take you to an island in the North. Where will spring a burning lake. Bursting from a black mountain's peak. There, I will drown my father's killer! Follow the vixen's tail to the dwelling of the Ancient One. To seek the fated sword that matches your cruel rage. Why are you giving me fortunes, witch? Where your ashes end... another will begin her journey. A maiden king. Release me. You cannot escape from Fate the Norns have spun. Now, be gone! These slaves will go to Uppsala. Those to the market in Kiev. Those, send them to Constantinople. And these strong ones... will make it all the way to Fjölnir's post in Iceland. Who is this Fjölnir? Fjölnir the Brotherless. He's so called after he killed his brother. The disgraced King Aurvandill War-Raven. I know of him. Why are these slaves bound for Iceland? Fjölnir rules Hrafnsey. He fled to the backwater frontier with his wife and son. After King Harald of Norway took his kingdom. Fjölnir killed his brother for nothing. Now he's a sheep farmer. Father! Worry not. When I meet your owner, I will thank him for the warmth you gave me. Bring those two ropes. Your sheeps' clothing does not disguise you, Northman. What sent you, spell speaker? Who wants to be a slave? Hide your cunning. Show the shepherd you are a sheep. I will show the shepherd his death. Hold on! Come here! Stay still! Hold onto my hand! I hold you! Draugr I will avenge you, father! I will save you, mother! I will kill you, Fjölnir! Iceland To the shore! Get up and try to bend. There! Move! Let him rot! The seagulls will eat him. They are hungry. Move, slave! Why would you stow away to such a hellish place? This ground harbours evil. My fate has brought me here. To find what was stolen from me. And what is that? A mother. A father. A kingdom. This is your kingdom? The traitor who stole my kingdom fled here when another king took it from him. I will leave when I am done with him. I am Olga of the Birch Forest. Tonight, I vow to escape this island. Then you must face many foes. As do you. But you'll face them alone. Your strength breaks men's bones. I have the cunning to break their minds. You two, hold your traps! Walk off! - Why are we doing this? - What? - This. - What? It is slave work. You are the chieftain. It is your temple, and I'm the heir to this holy chiefdom. No man knows if he will set a place that makes you turn as a king or as a slave. Best to be prepared for both. And to stave off the latter, the least you can do is show your slaves you're as strong as they are. But... no one is watching us. Go fetch you some weed. Think on what I said. Keep the shield off that man! - Hold on! - We will see. No! No! Fjölnir, my Lord! Your shipment is here. Come on! Show me! - Where is the rest of them? - Get on your feet! On your feet, slaves! Now off, bastards! Pity those. They can't stand. They won't last for winter. Sell all of them. Let me see this one. We've kept you to us. I'm not impressed. His stench. Never look me in the eye, slave! Well, I wonder what they call a beast like you in the Land of Rus. I am Björnúlfur. By name alone, you can tell he's as strong as a bear. But if you are as untrustworthy as a wolf, I swear I'll put you down myself. We'll keep this one. The rest can go. But mother needs two in the kitchen and one for the laundry. Move! - And two males for the harvest. - Well. These two for the kitchen. And that for laundry. And choose two males for fields. And her too. Make her arms white. And her hair long. Land climb-out, huh? Bear-Wolf! Even if you did escape this farm, you'll only be a target for the blue foxes in so case. This island is a barren waste. You best bring yourselves on to sleep. Cut! Cut! Cut! Thieving demon witch! Away! Away! Away with you! Away! Be gone! Be gone! I will avenge you, father! I will save you, mother! I will kill you, Fjölnir! Pull! Go! Go take a pee! There! Stop there! You! Get on with it! On with you, now! Out of your wits? Turn around! Shut the door! Did you find it? What you lost. In the house the day you were there. That. And more. It's a nightmare. Then you must wake up. Their nightmare. You! You! Move now! You come with us! You don't belong here. Fjölnir wants you close. If you lose me, will you come look for me too? - Will you? - You! Sit, Amleth! Son of Aurvandill. Did your haunting friend tell you of me? No. One was more talkative. Your old fool. Heimir. He speaks of days past. And days yet to come. Fjölnir cut out his tongue, plucked out his eyes, before killing him. But I made him once anew. Kind friend. Now, they will avenge you too. I fear you must address me. Alas, I made him no new ears. They also met with Fjölnir's blade. Enough! You know why I've come. You are still a beast cloaked in man flesh. - Speak, witch! - So be it, slave! The Wandering Prophet! Wake now... from your murder! Hear me! Heimir! He's come! Hello, puppy! I seek the weapon the Norns of Fate chose for my revenge. Hear me. Forged by the deadliest wasps ever did crawl from under a worm's belly. A sword of the most secret rare iron. Wound with bones with a locking handle; weightless in its owner's hand. It's like a dragon's fang. Its bite can never be dulled. Never broken or bent. Its blade could only be pointed in human blood. It is in a battlefield like no other. Its name... Draugr. No longer is dead. It is fated. Yet difficult is the sword's nature. For it can only be unsheathed in the dark of night. Or else at Hel's Black Gates. For Gates of Hel, there will my sword be just. I will enjoy feeding Draugr to an everlasting night. And shall you also enjoy the moment when you must choose between kindness for your kin, or hate for your enemies. It is nothing. My heart knows only revenge. Show it to me. You must make a visitation to Draugr's owner; the Mount Dweller. Mark well the full moon's light. For shadows are not hospitable hosts. Mark well the full moon's light! Thorir will choose the strongest. The more it will prove that Hákon Ironbeard's men are born of mud and water. Yeah. Mud will be all that remains of them. Rakki! Rakki! Rakki. Take Rakki home. And you two, it's nearly dawn, go to your beds. - Yes, my Lord. - Rakki! Wake! You! Fetch her. You know the one. Wake up, Olga! Wake up. Get on your feet. The hair of a Valkyrie. My sumptuous Slav bitch. Don't clean a whore! You'll take care of her. Or you'll both be dead in the ground. Thank the Norns that the woman tied is the only blood that runs in your house tonight, coward! I am a fool. It was foretold that I would slay my father's killer in a burning lake. Until that day comes... I will torment the man who made my life hell. Now sleep well, night blades! Yes. We thirst for vengeance. But we cannot escape our fates. Put them in line! Come on! - Wait! - Don't cover it up! Where are they taking us? Something about the chieftain's feast. Last night, I saw him with you. Then you know a Fjölnir's touch won't linger on me when I leave this island. You marked him well. I have found the cold iron that will stand him down. - When will you do it? - When I must. For now, I will haunt this farm like a hungry corpse that's run from the grave. - Fjölnir thinks Amleth is long dead. - Yes, but what of your mother? She will revel in Fjölnir's anguish. She only feigns her love to protect the child. - Won't she... - When I free her, I will bring the boy if I must. - They'll move me back into the kitchen. - Our plan's worth the wait. - Go. - Björnúlfur, move! - You! To the back! - Hurry! Thorir, my Lord, we're missing one man. This is for a Sunday party. I'm not a child, my hair is my own. I know grown men who need a woman to tame their hair. Put them in line! You can celebrate after the game, slave. Move right away! My Lord! Thorir, my Lord! Can you fight, slave? Look me in the eye, slave. I asked: do you know how to fight? What's this noise? Never seen a "knattra" before? By nightfall, you'll have seen enough of it. Play to blood! Throw it here! Shame on you, foolish man! We need more men! No! No! - Gunnar! - No! Halt the game! Halt it now! Don't touch him! - Gunnar! - Halt the game! - Step back, man! - Gunnar! - Goodbye, child! - No! Fjölnir, call him! - Gunnar! Gunnar! - Wake up! Stupid child! Wake up! - Gunnar! Gunnar! - Gunnar! Wake up! Wake up, Gunnar! Wake up! Gunnar! Gunnar! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Did we win? Spoken like a true chieftain's son! - Brave boy! - You're brave, Gunnar! You! This way. You showed yourself brave and loyal. When we return to the farm, certain privileges will be granted to you. Your work will be less burdensome. You will command others' burden. And Björnúlfur... As a reward for winning us the game, I'll let you choose a woman for yourself. Even that Slav bitch I've seen you eye. Father's fond of her too. Unyielding. But know that we will never make you a free man. The stench of a low-point slave cannot escape him. Yes. Thank you. We'll miss you cleaning the shithouse. To my son, Gunnar! - Skol! - Skol! Olga! You've found me. Were you lost? Only if you were searching for me. Mother Soil, hear your daughter's prayer. Show me the way to destroy our enslavers. And free my love from his fire and sorrow. What did you do? Here, where the threads of Fate bound us together. Embraced beneath the trees. Here, I speak with the Earth. What did she tell you? Help to reach your mother. My Earth magic will stoke the flames of your sword. Tomorrow night, you and I... will begin this nightmare. And bring Fjölnir's life to chaos. The Night Blade Feeds You finished. Back to the stables. You! The servants of Freyr. Lay them before our Lord's seat. You swan! - Fear not! You're the first of many! - Please! Oh, I will find who did this! I will find them and I will tear out their eyes! And I will tear out their tongues! They will all sob in Hell! Look, father! Look what's been done to my brave friends! Christian monsters! Monsters! Monsters! You bear! Did you do this? Answer me! Answer me! - Stop this! - Son! Regain your calm! They were good boys. By Freyr, we will avenge them. Take him away. Is Thorir right? Could it be the Christian swines? Their god is a corpse nailed to a tree. For what? These boys never touched them. And how might they find the weapons? No. These wounds are not of our world. This distempered spirit will ride again. It wheels a hungry blade. Go! I will prepare a sacrifice. On with you! Bloodthirsty Christians! Do as you are told! Go! The mushrooms, I got them. Not tonight. The spirits will invade, there's still more blood. Black spirit, abate! Bear this offering to your mistress! And she's your rageful corpse. - Rakki! - Rakki! - What is it, Rakki? - Rakki! Sit down, Rakki! Rakki! Rakki! Rakki! Free him. Freyr, he seemed he's chosen for himself. He was deemed to fit for sacrifice. - Blinded by his blood. - Let's hope his hunger has subsided. This is not the work of my God. This is truly sorcery. Tonight, you will be armed to defend the farm, for this is also your home. How can we trust them to protect us? There, you dog! Your father does not want an uprising by emboldened slaves. Do not doubt his wisdom! Go! Black dreams, rise! Aye, slaves! Hold onto your sticks! You're not fending off the demon with that thing. Here! Hungry? Tonight, you are the food! Go get some air. I'll finish here. Go on! Don't touch them! Don't look in their eyes! The night spirits have entered their skulls and are riding their minds! Thorir, here! I see it! Be gone! Tonight before dawn. Father. Leave me. Your sword is long! Stop your jest. I am your son. Amleth? You live still? A life of death. It is sworn to survive to this moment. Tomorrow, I shall finish my deeds and honour. Only then when I discover whether living is to my like. - You're your mother's son. - And my father's. I've come to avenge King Aurvandill. And choke my traitorous uncle in his death blood. And free you. I see you have inherited your father's simpleness. What say you? I never mourned him. You were his Queen. Your father beat me. Because I bore him a son. No. His affections were only for silver and rutting his whores. I know not if he had heart enough to love you. - Silence! - He was a coward feigning to be a king. He was nothing. He was just another proud lusting slave. Hold your tongue! You spit in the face of your dead husband! He had this brother! His fine brother! The bastard has no shame of himself. Nor his trade. Your uncle loved me. He knew well my past. Amleth. Even now, you believe the fairy tale I told you was true? "A noble bride hailing from the Land of Brittany." I never began as his bride. How easily we all become princesses again when the beasts take us for their wives! Yes. You were forced upon your mother. Gunnar was received freely with love. No. And now hear this. It was I who begged on my knees for Fjölnir to kill King Aurvandill. I pressed my lips on his strong sweet hand. And kissed it. And I begged. So that this day would never come. Fjölnir ordered your death along with your own mother's blessing. But I saw it. I saw Fjölnir carrying you away. - Screaming. - Screaming? - I was laughing. - Lies! Now that you're here, what will you do? I should kill you and all that is dear to you. But you love me. A son loves his mother and a mother loves her son. And you saved your brother's life. You... You... love! You... love! None but me knows who you are. And you're so up for revenge. Child born for savagery. If you kill Fjölnir. If you kill Thorir. And if you're so untamed just to kill my Gunnar. You will be my new king. And together... we can rule. Bitch! Your taste and your mind reek of your father! - You should have joined him in death! - Your words are poison! I am your death! Where is your mother? Tell me. Where? She is as evil as Fjölnir! I will destroy him and all that she loves! I will be an ice storm of iron and steel! I will have my vengeance! And more! But what must we do now? I must head to the hills. My mother discovered who I am. And soon everyone. - I'll go with you. - No. They don't know you're part of this. Tomorrow, they will hunt for me. Why? Have you killed her? I will not kill a woman. Not even her. Thorir medicined my mad fury. Good riddance. Tomorrow night, you will return to kill Fjölnir? If the Norns of Fate allow it. Whatever happens tomorrow, be ready to run. His heart... His... His heart... He's taken his heart! What demon is this? What demon eats the hearts of brave young men? Freyr, do you hear me? Behave! Be a man in front of your inferiors! There's no evil spirit here! I told you! I told you! It is my cursed son Amleth! But we lost him as a boy. You must believe me! He's here! The prodigy of Aurvandill lives still! I fear he was led here by the raven spirit... of your dead brother. - It's impossible. - Think! He's killed your men! He's murdered your eldest son! And he will not rest till you crawl on the ground and our Gunnar is slain beside you. It is Amleth! No god can help you with this task! You must discover my son and kill him with your own hands! Let my words be the whetstone for your biting rage! For the mischief of last night was not the work of one man. Find the slaves who allied with him. Find them! On your knees! Down, will you! Down, will you! I know not or care not if a slave aided in the death of my son. But this is the end you will all meet if you speak not what you knew. No? I see you are no longer afraid of a woman's blood! You! Of course, it is you! Fjölnir! Leave her alone! I offer you your son's heart in exchange for her life! I am Amleth the Bear-Wolf! Son of King Aurvandill War-Raven! And I am his vengeance! Kill him! - Bring him to me! - Kill him! He's mine! In the end... you're just like your father. Evil begets evil. How do you know it's your son's heart? And not the heart of a rabid dog you killed two nights ago? Where is it? You can't... can't kill me. Even if you were to strike me with your sword. It is not the point. It is not my time. I will die in battle. Where's my son's heart? Odin the Old Father will vanquish your god of erections. - Fear him! - Silence! I will come back for your heart. And your mother and I will eat it. Odin, let a Valkyrie, your warrior maiden follow me to your shining gates. I see my father and mother! I see my dead kindred! I see my master in Freyr's Hall! He calls me to him! Tonight, I'm mourning for Thorir's end. With an end of this swift steel, it's sent to the highest tree of the battle with my first brother. You now remain our only heir! My hour of grief has passed. The time of revenge is upon us! This is not Valhalla. I did not carry you that far. I am no Valkyrie. The dreams of your afterlife must wait. Besides... I'm not done with you yet. My fate brought me to Iceland to carry out my pledge of vengeance. But my fate... did not ready me for finding you. I thought they must always feel my heart in stone. I could not think I would open it for a last time. You sacrificed yourself while you could flee. And you came back for me. I have never felt close to another person. Not since I was a child. I'll curse your mother's evil. She murdered my past. Could it not be that the Norns of Fate have spun another thread for you to follow? What have your gods told you? That wherever I go, I must take you with me. I have kinsmen in Orkney. We can find... we can find safe passage there. Together. I cannot truly believe that you may extinguish your fire for vengeance. Hate is all I've ever known. But I wish I could be free of it. It is for you to choose. Let us find our future. Welcome, seafarers. The deck of this wooden boat will only be near ground after 21 days. If our luck-spirits smile upon us. I was expecting more of Fjölnir's men. His son was to join us. Thorir departed early... on his own ship. Anchor up! Sail down! - Ropes up! - Up! - After the wind, helmsman! - I will! Your wounds. It is nothing to what happened to you. I've forgotten already. My family's blood! My own blood is inside you! You are the well our dynasty will spring from. I did not wish you to know until I could trust that the child would be safe. Well, if Fjölnir lives, our children will never be safe. If he knew of this, he will hunt you with all the fire of the gods. - It cannot wait! - Stop this! There's now a living thread that binds us. I was a fool. I wish to flee with you from my fate. My vision shows me you will have two. My sword, it will save them. But you have to come with us. You must! It was prophesied that I must choose... between kindness for my kin, and hate for my enemies. And see what hope we have before us. I choose both. Take her to Orkney. In return for this ring, my kinsmen will give you ninefold its worth. No! No! Amleth! You will be a mother to a king! You cannot escape our fates! No! Amleth! Ride with me, daughters of the North wind! Carry me and mine to the shores of my children's forbears! There I'll show you a forest of birch! Fathomless branches to dance your tempest with! Raptured by your most righteous breath! It's over there! Follow Fjölnir! It is him! Close the hut! The puppy you once hunted ate off your nose. Now the wolf has grown... youngest for the rest. Whatever you hear, you must stay here. Keep him safe. - And keep both of you safe. - I will. Take your freedom! And do with it what you will! Fjölnir! Never! In the heart. Thank you. Mother! I will meet you at the Gates of Hel. At the Gates of Hel... you will find me. And there you will die! By the hand that killed your father. The Gates of Hel Slain by iron. We should all meet again at the strong wall of the Old Father. I will avenge you! I will honour our blood! I will cut the thread of Fate! I will avenge you! I will honour our blood! I will cut the thread of Fate! I will avenge you! I will honour our blood! I will cut the thread of Fate! I will avenge you! My blood will be on! Valhalla waits! The thread that binds us can never break. We are safe. Now make your passage. { The Northman }
