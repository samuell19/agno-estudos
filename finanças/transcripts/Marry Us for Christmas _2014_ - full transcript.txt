We all see it. - Now, let me tell you something, - All right? - Life is short... - And love is everything. - It's not to be toyed with or - Taken for granted. - Why do you think you've taken so - Long to get married? - Because you wanted to be sure -- - You wanted to be sure that you - Found the one. - And now you're just gonna throw - It away -- is that it? - [[[Sniffles] - feel like an idiot. I do, too. So, do you still want to get - Married? - [[[Sighs] - sniffles] - crying] i do. - Sniffles] - love you. I love you. - [[[Sobs] okay, well, we -- we got a - Wedding.
