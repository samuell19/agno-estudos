Daddy, the sun is setting. Aww, it's so pretty. You're horrible. Who did your hair? Who did your coat today? And look at your dirty shoes. Like, you could have did better than that. Man, you stink, like, come on. Go take a shower. You're so ugly, Please don't touch me. Please don't touch me. Hey, where you going? If you ain't wanna be picked on, you shoulda never been born ugly. Gimme that back, my daddy gave that to me. No. Give it! This is mine now. Stop, give it! No! Give it. No, this is mine now. Please, stop acting like you really hurt. Get up. Come on, stop playing, get up. Come on, get up. Bruh, I don't think she's moving. Peter? Honey, how you hanging in there? Yeah, that was his only child. His wife died while giving birth to his daughter. That's so sad. I heard he's not even planning to press charges against the kid who killed his daughter. What? No way in the world I could have done that. He would be a jail, and his parents should have some kind of responsibility. Well, apparently, his parents weren't in his life, so. I think I heard that his dad passed away years ago. Baby. Oh, sweetie. You know, you should really consider getting away from here. You need a fresh, new environment, and Virginia has nothing left for you. And it doesn't have to be right away. But you really should go.

My chemistry professor, he told me I needed to speak to you directly about getting an extension on a project. Really, I'm just a little overloaded with some work right now, and I wanted to speak to you about getting an extension. Come in. Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt you guys. Are you principal Hanway? Yes. I'm Peter. I was supposed to meet you earlier. Oh, I have to take this, okay? We'll talk about this later, okay? I'm so sorry to interrupt you guys. Sorry, brother. Peter! Pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, how long have you been working with Evolve? It seems to be a fantastic organization. It is, I love it. I've actually been there, what, three months now and they got me focused on the bullying portion of like the school programs and things. So, I'm enjoying it, can't complain. Excellent. So, what made you want to get involved in the after-school program to help victims of bullying? Ooh. Wow. Wow, that's kind of a big question. It started with, actually, my church. I was youth director there for, what, a few years, and I loved it so much that I went back to school, got my degree in social work, and I was a social worker for about 10 years. And the rest is history. Plus I'm passionate about the topic of bullying, so it worked out. Well, we're very grateful for your service. Thank you. You mentioned youth pastor. I just want to remind you that this is a public school and we have to keep our religious and political beliefs personal. Absolutely, 100%, I agree with that. And you know, plus, there's ways to share God without even actually saying His name. I know what you mean. Oh, do you? I'm a Christian, too. Really? Okay, cool. Cool. Well, let's get back on track here. Yeah. So, this is a volunteer opportunity for the students. So there's no guarantee that anyone will even show up. I understand. I mean, come on, they're teens. I get it, that's fine. Yeah, but that being said, our counselor, Jane, has been talking to some of the students since the beginning of the year and it looks like we have about six signed up, so we'll see if they show up. Cool. Sounds good. All right. So, we'll have you start tomorrow and you'll actually be in this classroom right here. Really? Nice, perfect, I like it. All right, so we'll see you tomorrow. Of course, yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much for your time, I appreciate it. I appreciate it. All right. Hey, actually, Principal Hanway, nevermind. I'm sorry, I kind of answered it in my head already. Sorry about that. Okay. All right, you have a good day. You too. All right. See you tomorrow. Alrighty. Peter, you still there? Yeah. Yeah, ma, I'm here. Well, I'm just glad that you got up out of Virginia and went out there for a fresh start. Yeah, me too. You know, I think it was needed. How do you think working at that new school is gonna go? I think it's going to be all right, you know? The principal seems pretty nice. Well, I just hope he's not one of those pushover types. So, he is a she, Ma. Oh, okay. Well, I hope that she's not one of those pushover types. Nah, nah, she's pretty cool. She's real nice. She's actually good with the students, too. Oh. Pretty nice, huh? Mm-hmm. She cute, too? Come on, Ma. What? I'm just curious. Yeah, she's beautiful, actually. Oh. She got rings on? Nope. She sure don't. I was looking hard, too. I ain't see nothing. But look, you gotta stop that, Ma. You gotta stop it, all right? You know, I'm not in any way ready for any kind of relationship right now. Well, it's been eight years since your wife passed, Peter. Ma, this has nothing to do with Tameka. Oh. Well, you just take your time, baby. You know that Brianna was very special to me. Don't do that. Don't do what? Don't bring up Brianna, okay, Ma? Like, look, I'm trying my best to just get this out of my mind. I can't, I don't even want to think about it. It helps to talk about. It doesn't help me, Ma. Okay? Look, what helps me is just not thinking about it at all. Okay? That's what helps me. No, you just can't go running away from dealing with this. Well, you the one who told me to run, Ma. You the one who told me to pack up, come to Maryland, get away from all this. You told me that. Oh, oh, no. No, I told you to leave so that you could heal, so that you could deal with everything. I didn't say run away. And don't you dare take out your anger on me. You didn't just lose a daughter. I lost my grand baby. I'm sorry, Ma. I'm sorry. You know, this stuff just ain't easy. Yeah, well, it's not supposed to be. Oh, hey. How are you? I'm Mr. Ryans. What's your name? Hello, I'm Wanda. Wanda. Nice to meet you, Wanda. Wow. So I'm the counselor that's gonna be talking with you guys today. By any chance, did you notice anybody else coming in when you were here? No, I'm the only one. All right, no problem. So we'll just go ahead and get started just as soon as a few more people get in here, all right? Cool, awesome. All right, guys, just take a seat. Oh, hey. Hello. I'm Jane, school counselor. And you must be Peter? Mr. Ryans, that's me. So nice to meet you. Thank you. Okay, well, I rounded up three more for you. They had all expressed interest in this group, but apparently they had gotten a little distracted in the hallway on the way over. That's all right, they're teens, you know? Let 'em live. That's true, that's true. If you need anything, I'll be in my office till about 5:30. And if you don't, just make sure you turn off the lights and lock up on your way out. - Will do. - All right? Thank you, uh, Jane, right? You bet. All right, thank you. All right, well, hey, good to see you guys. I'm Mr. Ryans. I'm from Evolve. As you guys can see here, we're a nonprofit organization and they sent me here as a counselor, partnering with your school to talk with you guys a little bit about bullying. So I'm glad to be here, glad to see your faces. Excuse me, ma'am? Are you supposed to be in here? Yeah, but I can go? No, no, no, come on in, come on in. Please, have a seat. Empty chair right there. Come on, come on. Yeah, we're just talking a little bit about the program and everything else, kind of the intro to the class. But I'm curious, do any of you guys know each other? I don't know anyone here. I mean, I've seen them around school, but we don't talk or anything. Okay, well, hey, nothing wrong with that. That's the best place to start, you know? When you don't know somebody, we get to know each other. And, hey, why don't you kick us off since you started talking? My name's Carson Palmer. I'm here 'cause the school counselor suggested me to come here so I can be around people I can better relate to. Hey. Yeah, yeah, this the after school bullying program? It is, yeah. James. Okay, cool. How y'all doing, how y'all doing? - How you doing, brother? - All right. All right, I'm Mr. Ryans. Sure, sure. We're just kind of getting to know each other a little bit. I mean, since you so graciously decided to show up late and everything, why don't you kick us off next? Tell us a little about yourself. All right, well, obviously I ain't no weird nerd, nothing like that. But basically, I sent a provocative picture to my girl, right? We broke up later on. She ended up sending it to the whole school, and, yeah, so. Oh, I'm sorry. Listen, James, that is tough, but let me give you a little bit of encouragement, okay? There's actually people in our world who really have a large platform and they've made mistakes, just like you did. And, unfortunately, their mistakes have cost them a lot more. So they've came out on top. I believe you'll be able to come out on top. All right, we'll talk more about this later, but just be encouraged, man. This is not a forever thing. You're gonna be all right. Let's keep it going, this is fun. How about you, Sir, in the blue shirt? Tell us about yourself. My name is Darren. Okay. Do you want to share anything else, a little more? I'm pretty quiet. Really? James, no, stop. Okay? There's absolutely nothing wrong with being a little bit introverted, okay? So tell us a little bit more. I'm, I'm used a lot at the school. People, they'll pretend to befriend me just so that I can help them with their school work. Why would they want to befriend you just so you can do their schoolwork? Uh, Mr. Ryans? This guy is like the smartest in our entire school, like top notch smartest. Really? Okay. Well, I mean, that's a good thing, right? I mean, there's nothing wrong with being obviously one of the smartest kids in class. That should make you very desirable as a friend. I have a question, though. I would want to know why in the world would you just allow yourself to be used like that? I mean, what would happen if you just stopped all together doing their work? Poof. Poof? Okay, what do you mean by poof? Then I'd have no friends. All right, wouldn't that be a good thing? I mean, who would want to be friends with someone who's pretty much fake anyway? A fake friend is better than no friend. I'm sorry, I've been talking a lot, Mr. Ryans, but I'd rather be alone. I don't want no fake people around me ever. Well, I'm Maria. Hi, Maria. We're glad you joined us. Why don't you tell us a little bit why you're here? Yeah, why did you decide to join us, Maria? I'm sorry, do you guys know each other? Everybody in here knows her. She's the pretty, popular, light-skin Instagram model with like 500,000 followers. What, you jealous? You sound jealous. What that got to do with anything? Shut up, boy. Stop, stop, stop. You guys, relax, okay? It's all right. You said Instagram. I mean, what do you mean Instagram? Well, Mr. Ryans, it means she gets half naked in front of hundreds and thousands of people for some likes and maybe a free makeup sponsorship. Hmm? Anyways, I'm just here to see if speaking in a group setting with other people who've also experienced bullying would be helpful. Girl, what kind of bullying have you ever experienced? Your kind. When jealous, unkempt females always got something to say. Girl, unkempt? Who are you calling unkempt? I'm calling you unkempt. What you gonna do? Huh, huh? Stop, stop, stop, hey, sit down. Looking all stupid. First of all. First of all, nothing. You need to get out my face. Hey, stop. You don't know me? No, she don't know me. I don't wanna know you. I'm frickin' outta here. I don't got time for this. Ha ha. No! Have a seat, don't leave. Nobody wants you here. Nobody want you here. Look at me, okay? Please, do not leave this class right now because of her or anybody else in here, okay? If you're gonna leave here, let it be because of me, because I failed you. Give me a chance, come on, have a seat. Give me a chance, give me a chance. We're not gonna do this, okay? That's not what this program is about. Okay? This is really an opportunity for us to actually connect, come together, okay? I understand, you know, we can have hostility, you know, you may not like each other. You may even be enemies, but here today, I need you to understand that by the end of this class, you're gonna be friends. Listen, whatever your issue is today, just understand that there's hope, there's an opportunity for you guys to have a better life. All right? And I'm gonna teach you that, okay? Yeah, yeah, James? Mr. Ryans, yeah, Stephanie smell good. I'm not trying to be funny. She just smelled good to me. Y'all know, like the Jergens, cherry almond Jergens? Oh, so y'all don't moisturize y'alls skin? Okay, whatever. I'm sorry, everybody. Stephanie, you smell good. That's all I was trying to say. All right, all right, cool. Listen, I appreciate that. You guys, I'm excited to be here, man. Come on, put on those smiling faces. Let's kick things off with a little activity. All right, come on, let's get loose. Stand up outta your desk. Stand up, stand up. Come on, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up. All right, just move your desks out of the way. We're gonna get in a circle and we are going to have a nice time, all right? Hey, you still here? It's almost five o'clock. I am. You could have warned me about these kids, you know. I wanted to surprise you. How'd it go today? It actually went pretty good. I can't complain. Good. A lot went on, you know, some rough patches, you know, fun moments, but at the end of the day, it, oh, actually, there's a student named James. You heard of him? James? Yes, of course. Hmm. By the look of your face, lets me know it's true. Unfortunately, yes. It got out to the entire staff. Wait, you saw it, too? Yeah. Oh my. Poor kid. Dang. Well, I mean, hey, look, out of all the kids that were here today, he seems like the one that's probably gonna be just fine very soon. Yeah, he'll be all right. Absolutely. Well, look, I gotta hit the gym. I'll finish cleaning up right here and lock the door on the way out and be good to go. Okay, well, I'll let you do your thing. Okay. Look, I really appreciate you. Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. All right. Hey, sorry, nevermind. I'm good. I'm sorry about that. You know, this is the second time you did this to me in two days. What's going on? I know, I'm sorry. My fault, I got a lot going on. These kids was crazy. I'm just, I'm good, though. Everything's fine. Okay. Have a good night. All right, you too.

So I figured we could just take a second and talk about some of the things we hate about school. Wanda, why don't we start with you? Do I have to go first? You don't have to, but we'd love to hear a little bit of your story. If you wouldn't mind sharing, please. What's something you hate about high school? Going to class late. Late? Who cares about going to class late? I do. And clearly you have no idea what it's like dreading to go to class and fear that half of the class is waiting for you just to try out their new fat people jokes. Look, Wanda, you ain't that big, all right? I know people fatter than you. Shut up, James. You shut up. Look, you got some size and all, but don't worry about that. And I ain't trying to be rude, so don't tell me shut up. You shut up. Whatever. James, no, we're not doing that, okay? I know you're trying to help, but we're not doing that. All right, we want to hear you, Wanda, sorry about that. Please, please continue. Tell us what's going on. Mr. Ryans, I hate going to class late because, because when I'm late, I'm noticeable. Mm-hmm. It's like everyone is watching me as I walk to my seat and all I feel are eyes as I walk past their desks. But when I'm early, Mr. Ryans, when I'm early and seated at my desk, no one pays attention. It's like, I'm either a walking billboard that everyone can just laugh and point at, or, or I just don't exist at all. I know what you mean. I guess I have a certain look that makes people think it's their job to make me feel terrible about who I am. About time white people know how it feel to be treated just because of how you look. Stephanie, no. Mr. Ryans, can I say something? Absolutely, Carson, you may. To be honest, I have no reason to like black people. Say what? My whole life, it's been black kids who picked on me. It was a black man who broke into my house and took everything of value from us. It's a black guy at my afterschool job who makes every day I go in there a living and to be quite honest, I grew up in a house where neither of my parents have anything positive to say about black people. Now, and that all being said, I don't let my parents influence me. I don't let any single experience I've had with any black person paint a picture in my mind that all black people are the same. I just choose to go through life treating everyone the right way, even if I get slammed in the way. I heard that. I respect it. Do me a favor, though, yo. Don't ever invite me to your house, 'cause I ain't coming. I don't care if you got Hamburger Helper, baked apple pie, I ain't coming. But, nah, for reals, yo, I respect that. Look, look, I appreciate you sharing. Carson, thank you. Thank you for sharing your little story. Wanda, thank you for sharing. See, the truth is, you know, we all experience something about school that we hate, all of us. All of us have pains and issues we deal with, but there's ways to cope, so let's take a minute and talk about some of those things, okay? ♪ Yeah I got bad thoughts that make my mind scared ♪ ♪ Hold me hostage and they don't fight fair ♪ ♪ Who gonna pray for me and wipe all my tears ♪ ♪ Who gonna save me if you not right here ♪ ♪ Ooh this darkness it make my sight clear ♪ ♪ Take me away 'cause I don't like here ♪ ♪ Ghosts of my past ♪ They filling the night air ♪ Wake me up ♪ I'm trapped in my nightmares ♪ Wake me up ♪ I'm trapped in my nightmares ♪ Wake me up ♪ Back to life back to life What you looking at?

I'm just so focused on work and raising my kids right now. Mm-hmm. Wait, kids? Hold up, hold up. All this time, you've never told me you had kids. Yeah, I have two. Two? Nice, nice. And, forgive me for asking, but is their dad like in their life or? They're both adopted. Oh. Something I always wanted to do, since I'm adopted. I didn't know that. Wow. Yeah. Wow. Well, congrats on the children. Thank you. What what about you? Do you have any kids? I did, yeah. I had a daughter, but she passed away last year. Yeah. I'm so sorry to hear that. Wow. It's okay. You know, for obvious reasons, it's not something I like to talk about or bring up that much, but I'm doing better, I'm okay. I won't bring it up again. I'm sorry. But if you ever do want to talk, I'm here. I appreciate that, thank you. There is actually something I want to talk to you about. I was curious if you're really that bad at bowling? Oh, you know what? You know what, you know what? Let me say something. You talking about me, you better. One pin down? You better roll a strike. You sitting there talking about me, you better roll a strike. You ain't said nothing. You ain't said nothing, but dang, girl, I got this. Talking about me, I need to see you. Let's go, let's go. Here we go. Show this bad boy right here. Put a little bit of the booty out, like that. Oh my. Stick it out. By God, yeah, yeah. All right, now see that, that one don't count. - I mean? - That one didn't count. That one didn't count, okay? I just had to reset, you know, do a little bit different flow. Wow. - I got this one, though. - Four pins? I'm gonna pick it up. If I just stay focused, I might get out of this school. Trust me, you'll get out. I don't know, man. I got you, man. Stephanie! All right. Take it easy, kid. I got it. What's up, girl? Hey. So, you going to Mr. Ryans' after school program? Yeah. Girl, why you so mean? I ain't mean. You is mean. I ain't mean. All right, meanie. I'm sorry, you almost ripped your book. Yeah, see, I need that smile. You're stupid. You're stupid. No, you're definitely stupid. Who is that girl he talking to? What you even doing out here? - Um, I forgot. - Get it together. Hey, James. Good morning, Cherie. I see you decided not to upgrade. And who are you? Who are you? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with us? What's wrong with her hair? Like, may I suggest a brush? Stephanie. Does she even own a comb or brush? A simple wash and brush. I don't even know you. Something wrong with y'all. You're both ignorant, and that's why you my ex-girlfriend. What's up, ladies? Hey, Jay. Hey, Mr. Ryans. Carson, hey man, you're early. You know we don't get started for another, what, 30 minutes or so? Yeah, can I just talk to you about something real quick? Of course, man, please, come on over here. What's going on? Okay, so I have this job that I work sometimes after school and on the weekends. And there's this guy there who just hates me for no reason. I haven't really done anything to him, he just seems to make every day I come in a nightmare. Hmm. I'm sorry to hear about that, man. Well, have you told your boss about it? No. Why not? I mean, I don't want to snitch on him. And I feel like telling my boss isn't going to do anything, either, because you know, their families are friends, so he's not going to fire them, so I'm just an outcast. Got you. Wow, yeah. Yeah, that sounds like a tough situation, man. To be honest with you, it sounds like one that's not gonna get much better. I just remembered something. Wow, so I was just at the gym the other day with my personal trainer and he actually owns the gym. He was telling me that he's looking for somebody working there part-time and you might be a good fit. You know, if it's something you're interested in, I could maybe set up an interview for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally, totally, that sounds great, yeah, yeah. Awesome, man. Look, so let's do this. Let's start with you talking to your parents first. Mm-hmm. Okay? Tell them about everything that's going on and based on what you guys come to, let me know and I can set up an interview for you guys, all right? Okay, that sounds great, Mr. Ryans. Thank you so much. My man. Thank you so much. Appreciate you, bro. All right, I'll be back here in like half an hour. - Sounds good. - All right. We gonna have fun today, man. Yes, Sir. Yeah. All right. Hey, I'm running late for a meeting, but I just wanted to let you know I really enjoyed myself last night. I enjoyed myself, too. And maybe we can do it again soon? Of course. I call you later? Sounds good. All right. - See you. - See you. Look, look, look, look, look, all I'm saying is you guys, your generation is just completely spoiled. I'm sorry, it's true. You guys are spoiled. No, just because you grew up in the stone age. What? The stone age? Mr. Ryans, Mr. Ryans? So my mom, she told me that you guys had like some kind of machine separate from your phone that leaves messages or? I don't know. An answering machine, are you kidding me? Y'all don't know what a box answering machine is? Yeah. Yeah. I know what you talking about. Do you know what I'm talking about? Y'all used to get together as a family and like sing songs and record y'all's selves and then sit back and let somebody call y'all and then y'all ain't even be there for them to sing, or them to hear y'all singing. Yes. Yeah, we didn't have your little high tech cell phones you guys got now with ring tones and stuff, and app stores. No, we had to actually press a button, get around as a family and do something. And that's the difference between us and this generation now. We came together as a family. Mr. Ryans? That's how it be in class, too. We be keeping it real, though, with all that electronic stuff. Mrs. Preston took my phone, too, today. And I didn't even have it out. Cougar. She tried to take my phone, too. I said, nah, lady, uh uh. I ain't trying to slide like that. James, James, don't do that. Don't do that. That's exactly how rumors start, man. I'm playing, though. I get it, I get it, you're playing. But rumors like that actually can get people in a lot of trouble. Yeah, I know about that. So do I. Girl, what you mean you know about that? You the type that start them rumors. Meda, I don't know what your problem is, but I don't start rumors about no one. You need to stop coming for me. I just think it's kinda annoying you keep coming here day after day and you don't belong. You still don't. Wait, ladies, hold on one second. This is, I want to create a family atmosphere here, okay? All right, it seems like you to just have some hostility and we want to get this right, respectfully, okay? So, Stephanie, why don't you just share with us, why are you so adamant that she doesn't belong here? Well, because this group was supposed to be for those of us dealing with bullying, self-esteem issues and all of that stuff. She clearly don't got none of those issues. I mean, she's pretty, she's popular. Everything is perfect. You got everything going on great for you. I don't get it. 'Cause you jealous. Shut up. I don't have everything. My life ain't perfect. My mom's an alcoholic. And my dad, he's in prison. And if you think that having all these followers are great, man, you got it wrong. Because with all that comes haters, racists, comments, everything you could think of. And then on top of that, I got to come to school and sit with girls just like you. What a sad life you have, awe. Whatever. No, what a sad life you have. I don't know why you got so much hate towards this girl, but she has never done anything to you or anyone else in this group. There has gotta be some other reason why you got so much hate inside of you, but Stephanie, you got to find another way to let that mess out, 'cause I think everyone in here has had about enough of it. So, yeah. Sure told you, huh? My whole life, I've been picked on and laughed at because I don't look like all the other girls. I don't wear the latest fashion. I don't have the stylish things. And most of the time, it's either boys or super pretty girls who always have something bad to say. It hurts, and I build up a genuine hate for most people, especially girls that look like you. ♪ Dirty water ♪ Wash me clean ♪ You'll always be a part of me ♪ You don't deserve to be treated the way I treated you. None of y'all do, and I'm sorry. Well, look at that. Y'all finally got along, huh? I'm happy for y'all. That was beautiful, I ain't gonna lie. I was hoping y'all was gonna fight today, but it is what it is. Mr. Ryans, you the truth, man. You the truth. ♪ And I believe in what my eyes can not see ♪ I got one more. You're on top. Almost there. Good work, good work. Oh, gosh, you're killing me, dog. I thought coming here was gonna give me a chance to get away from that mental list of the school I got going on. What's going on? Nothing. Actually, it's all good, man. I was just, you know, got these kids that's on my mind constantly, man. I think, finally, for the first time, I'm finally getting through to some of them. That's awesome, man. And I think sometime, bro, at the end of the day, kids just need to feel that it's someone out there that has they back, you know? Yeah, absolutely. Except there's one thing I'm not feeling. The fact they be clowning me. They be catching me. One of them call me ancient. I mean, you got no spring chicken, bro. What is that supposed to mean? You're like two years younger than me, yo. Hey, but don't you forget it. No, they call me ancient 'cause they was talking about answering machines back in the day. You remember answering machines? Mr. Ryans? Carson, what's up, man? How you doing, Sir? I'm glad you could come through. Yo, look, I forgot to tell you. So sorry. So, this is Carson. Carson, this is Marshall. Marshall, Carson. Yeah. Nice to meet you, Sir. So I remember you telling me this a little while ago you were looking for some extra help to help around here with administration type stuff. So, Carson, he's actually looking for a little part-time gig, so I thought I'd connect you guys and see if there's something that might be there for him. Actually, I brought my resume for you, Sir. Okay. You'd be surprised how many people come looking for a job, but not actually prepared with a resume. How many days a week can your work? Right now, just one, 'cause I still have the other job and I want to give them at least two weeks notice. But once I'm done with that, I can do two days a week from five to 8:00 PM, anytime on Sundays. Okay, step into my office. Thank you. I appreciate you. Yes, Sir, man, I'll holla at you. Mr. Ryans, thank you. No problem. Hey, don't tease me. Bro, leave me alone. Gosh. All right, I got you Marshall, man. 10 sets, here we go. One. Two. This tutoring is so boring. Yeah. When am I gonna use this? I know I'm not. Same. I'm done with this. What? Girl, look. He's looking at you. So pathetic. You better go over there and get yourself an A in history. I'm not going over there. Watch, he'll come to me. Okay. What? You have a question? You're kidding me, right? When were they friends? I don't know. She's better stay away. Well, I know, he's yours. It says find the lateral. Just look at her. She's not even that pretty. Anybody else have a question? I just wanna say thank you so much for sticking up for me yesterday in Mr. Ryan's program. It's no problem at all. I didn't know you had that in you. I didn't, either. I was thinking, if you're free later, do you want to study later? Yeah, definitely. Cool. Maybe I can help you with your homework? Oh, you help me with my homework? Yeah, what do you mean? Nothing. I just don't hear that often. Yeah, well, I told you, I'm not like most girls out here. You did. I did. But can you walk me to class? Of course. Yeah? Yeah. Cool, let's go. Everybody, please, turn your pages to 17. This is where we go back over and relearn everything. It was terrible. I don't know, he just isn't who I thought he was. Ew. So disgusting. I can smell your B.O. from here. No. What's up, bro, how you doing? ♪ You protect my house Yo, hop up, hop up, hop up. You know the drill, hop up. ♪ I don't know ♪ I don't know how much longer I can go ♪ So you're trying to solve for the disparity of power. Yeah, 'cause it's like I can't get it. What's up, Maria? Hey. I'll talk to you later. Yeah, see you later. Okay, so, what's it like to be so popular? What are you talking about? Everybody knows you. Everyone thinks they know me, but you can't talk. Everyone knows you, too. It's not really in the same way, though. Everyone knows me for just being that weird, smart kid. But there's a difference between being popular, which is you, and, well, people just knowing who you are. Yeah, well, being popular's not what it's always cracked up to be. Yeah, okay. For someone who is so smart, you just don't get it, do you? We're not that different. You say everybody wants to get close to you, be your friend and use you, right? Well, the same thing happens to me. The only difference is they think just because I'm pretty or I have this large social media following, that they can be my friend. But to be honest, I don't know who my real friends are. But I can relate to you, Darren, more than you think. And I like that. You know, you remind me of a Bible verse. What? A Bible verse? Well, yeah. Random, I know. And I'm not quite sure how spiritual of a person you are, but I think only words from the Bible could accurately describe what, well, what I think about you. Well, you have my attention. Well, the verse is Song of Solomon 4:7, and it says, "Thous art are all fair, my love." "There is no spot in thee." And in not so old English, you are beautiful, Maria. Hmm. What's wrong? Nothing. It's just that I've heard so many guys tell me I'm beautiful. But when you said it, it's different. I really believe you. Well, Maria, you'll always be able to believe me. Thanks. Well, we should probably get back to the studying. Yeah, right. So, you're trying to figure out the disparity of power. Yeah, that thing. So essentially you just gotta take X and then divide it by the variable and. ♪ Love stop ♪ Wobbly wobbly ♪ Fight me if you want to ♪ No ♪ Here comes wobbly Wanda ♪ Here comes wobbly Wanda ♪ Wa wa wa Wanda ♪ No no no stop no leave me alone ♪ ♪ Leave me alone Wobbly Wanda in the building. ♪ Why do you bully me ♪ I don't know I don't know ♪ Why do you bully me ♪ I am love ♪ I am love love ♪ So why do you why do you pick on me ♪ ♪ Pick pick on you ♪ No pick on me ♪ My name is Wanda ♪ And I get get get bullied ♪ Stop it ♪ Ooh ♪ It's gonna be all right ♪ Yeah yeah ♪ How can you tell ♪ Yeah yeah ♪ I feel it in my heart ♪ Yeah yeah ♪ It's gonna be okay ♪ The sun is shining Hi, papi.

I'll DM you later, girl. I don't know why you think it's okay for you to put pictures all up on social media so everybody can see. What? I saw your page. And how did you see that? Don't matter how I saw it, I saw it. Oh, now you ain't gonna talk to me? I don't have to answer to you. I don't know where you got this new, little attitude from, but I ain't teach you to be disrespectful. You ain't teach me nothing. Are you serious? Ma, look Ma, I know you ain't a little girl no more, but you gonna have to learn something for me. With every decision that you make now, you're gonna have to deal with everything that comes with it. For example, put yourself on blast on social media, it's gonna come back to haunt you. It's gonna bite you in the butt sooner or later. You heard me? Ma, you feel me? Yeah. I'm sorry, Ma. I'm sorry that I just yelled at you. I love you, nina. I do. I just don't want you to end up on the same bad path that I did. I miss you, nina. I miss you, too, papi. Hey. Hey. I was thinking, if you're free Saturday, you want to come over? Uh, I mean, I know we ain't beefing no more, but I didn't know we was cool like that. Girl, do you want to come over or not? What are we doing? Well, since you asked, I was thinking we could do what I normally do. So I do manis and pedis and do a full face of makeup, do my hair, take cute selfies. What you think? That's not really my idea of fun. Okay, well, I'm not going to force you or anything, but let me just say this. You gotta make time for yourself. We all need that. Kind of reminds me of being a little girl and going into your mom's closet, putting on her clothes, going in her makeup bag, putting on her lipstick and just feeling beautiful. Uh, yeah, I never really did that 'cause I never was considered the pretty girl to anybody or like myself, nothing like that, so. Stephanie, you've always been the pretty girl and you still are. Society makes us believe that we have to fit into what they call beautiful. But what really matters is what's inside and your confidence. Don't let anyone take that away from you, okay? Thanks. No problem. So, Saturday, girls night, you in? I'll come. I'll come, I'll come. That's disgusting. Y'all friends now? Shut up, James. Nah, nah, nah, y'all friends now. I watched that whole thing right there. Beautiful. About time. It's about positivity. That's what we're here for. That's what we supposed to be doing. That's what we does. But where everybody else at? All right, guys, see, standing up, I mean, it's important. That's why we're here, you know? I mean, if you're standing up for yourself. Mr. Ryans, see, that's the problem. People always say stand up for yourself, but it's like some people just can't do that. Yeah, I mean, I tend to stay away from conflict. I hear you, Carson, but standing up isn't always about initiating conflict, you know? Standing up can start with simply just not letting someone see you cry or really just ignoring them, you know? Like, have you ever noticed that bullies, they just really want attention? You know, they want an audience, they want a reaction. That's what they really want. But that doesn't always work, 'cause like just not letting them see you cry or walking away from those situations, that don't always be cutting it, 'cause like some people will still continuously attack you. True, true, I get that. But, reality, at some point, that's the moment where you have to do a little bit more, right? You actually have to say something. You gotta do something. You can't just let people walk over you and have control over you because that's exactly what they want. They want control. There's a famous writer. He wrote something, I just love it. I wanna share it with you guys. He says, "Anyone who is among the living has hope", "for even a live dog is better off than in dead lion." Any thoughts on what that means? Because the dog still has hope, but the lion's dead. He can't do anything, but as long as that dog is alive, he still has a chance to do something with his life. That's it. You guys have hope, every last one of you. Because as long as you're breathing, you have hope. ♪ It was cold on the night ♪ You were born ♪ But I kept you away from the storm ♪ ♪ Wind like a side walk ♪ After the night of nonstop rain ♪ ♪ But we slept through the whole thing ♪ ♪ It was cold on the night you were born ♪ Yeah, babe, I'm on my way.

Darren, come here, bro, come here, come here, come here. Darren! Here you go. Thank you. You're welcome. Ooh. So, yesterday. That for me has got to be probably one of the hardest things I've ever had to do by telling those kids about Maria. Yeah. I can't imagine what they're going through right now. We're gonna have an extra couple of counselors come in and just really be there for the kids. She was so popular. This is gonna hit hard for a lot of people. Yeah. Oh, you're expecting somebody? Oh, yeah, that's my mom. The kids were with her today and she's dropping them off. Oh, snap, so I get to meet the mom and kids today? I guess so. All right, about time. Don't do that. I've been wanting you to meet them. Hi, baby. Hi, mommy. Who's this? This is mommy's friend, Mr. Ryans. Hi, Mr. Ryans. Hi, cutie. I like your dress, it's so pretty. Thank you. Go get ready for bed. Okay. Bye, Michelle. Bye. Oh my goodness. She is too cute. Thank you. Donna, you here, baby? Yeah, Mom, in the dining room. Oh, I didn't know you had company. Yeah, Mom, this is Peter, the guy I was telling you about. Oh, hello, Peter. Hello, how are you? Fine, thank you. Yes, Ma'am, nice to meet you. Pleasure's all mine. So Peter, would you like to stay for dinner? Sure, yeah, I'd love to. Oh, that's wonderful. Donna, sweetie, Leshon and I are gonna bring in the rest of the groceries. We'll be right back. Okay. All right, honey. Hey, where'd I put the? Hey, Leshon. What is going on? Leshon! Peter, what is going on? Peter! Peter, please tell me what is going on? Peter! That little boy killed my daughter. What do you mean that's the little boy who killed your daughter? Please tell me, what are you talking about? That little boy killed my daughter! A little over a year ago, my daughter was outside playing. There was a bunch of kids circling around her, and they were laughing at her, pointing fingers at her, clowning her. And one of them put his hands on my daughter, threw her to the ground and her head hit some metal object and killed my daughter. And the same little boy that threw my daughter down just ran out your room just now. I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense. All this happened in Virginia. How did he get here in Maryland? Well, the adoption agency gives you a full report of the child's history and background. His dad died when he was a baby and his mom got sentenced to prison for 12 years last year. He moved to Maryland with his grandfather, but his grandfather passed about nine months ago. The state took him and I adopted him about three months ago. And everything you said about your daughter was in his history report. Wait, so you knew about this? I knew what he did, but I didn't know that was your daughter. I had no idea about the victim's family. What are you talking about? What are you, stupid? It's easy to figure out that, you just look online. You can easily find out who the victim's family was. I didn't care to find that out, Peter. It wasn't my job to play detective, it was my job to give him a loving home. I'm so sorry, I had no idea. Okay. Well, now you do. Peter, Peter! No! No! Peter, nothing. Do you know what he did? He killed my daughter, Donna. Do you understand that the last thing that my daughter saw on this earth was the face of that little boy spewing hate in her face? She ain't seen the face of her father. She ain't get a hug from me. I ain't get the chance to protect her or nothing. That little boy doesn't deserve a family. He deserves to burn. Oh my. It just don't make no sense. How you gonna end our sessions now? Listen, guys, there's just a lot of things going on right now that you just don't know about. All that you was saying, don't give up and I won't give up on you, whatever you were saying, man, you a hypocrite. Listen, James, you know, there's just a lot more going on than you know right now. And I'm sorry, but it's just a little bit too much for me to be able to be at this school. But I thought you said this wasn't about you. It's about us. Yeah, Mr. Ryans. We're all dealing with Maria's death. This has nothing to do with Maria, okay? Look, you guys, listen. I know I may be gone, but just look around. You guys still have each other. And not only that, but you guys came here every single day together. You learn together. We laugh together. We cry together. So you guys are no longer alone. Now, what I think, I think it's time for you guys to put everything that we've learned into practice. Okay? It's time to stand up for yourselves. It's time to stand up for each other. Those days of bullying, being harassed and mistreated, they're long gone. Remember what I said? Bullies, they only can bully people who they have control over. No one has control over you anymore.

Oh, I forgot about that. So I wanted to surprise you. Surprise! I should've known it was you, watching hip hop and reading the Bible at the same time. Baby, you know that the Lord is working on me. Oh, I'm so glad to see you. But wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, hold on. I locked both doors, windows was closed. Alarm was set. How did you get in the house? I am from Baltimore, honey, and I've learned a few things over the years. Ah ha! Gotcha. So, what's going on? Hmm. Yeah, that's a big question, Mom. I got a lot to catch you up on. And, yeah. Peter, so that young child is living here in Maryland and he is the adopted child of the woman you like? So, what are you going to do? I got to leave her alone, that's for sure. And I got to leave that school. I just got to get up outta here altogether. This whole city is just. Let me ask you something. Why did you decide not to press charges against that child and his family? I don't know. I mean, I figured I'd be able to show myself that I actually forgave him. So you haven't forgiven him. I tried, Ma. I tried, I tried. I tried to drown him out of my mind, but I can't. What you're experiencing, baby, it doesn't just happen. Now this is too specific to be just some crazy coincidence. See, you haven't forgiven that child, yet here, here is your chance. Chance for what, Ma? Forgive him? At this point, I have no desire to forgive that boy. Oh, but you have to. I don't have to do anything, Ma. You don't get it. And I don't even see how this is coming out of your mouth right now. Brianna was your granddaughter. And you are my son. And you know that I loved Brianna, but she isn't here anymore, and I have to focus all of my love and my attention on who's sitting right here in front of me. Peter, Peter, baby, you are never gonna have any peace ever as long as you hold onto your hate for that child. And that poor woman, Lord have mercy. Donna. Yes, Donna. And it appears that she really likes you. And I can see, I can see that you've really fallen for her, too. Yeah. She didn't sign up for all of this crazy. I know right now she's probably hurt, confused. Mm-hmm. And she's not the only one. I bet that young boy is feeling the same exact way, too. And he needs someone, someone just like you in his life. What you talking about, Ma? This little boy killed my only child and you're sitting up here acting like I need to not only forgive him, but somehow accept him as my own son. Well, it won't be the first time in history that something like that has ever happened. Yo, you saw that game last night? Yes, man. Over time? Crazy. Man, what? I thought it was gonna be like a double overtime the way they were going. Yeah, for real. I was on the edge of my seat. And those fouls? Hey, is Mr. Robinson here? Nah, he's not here. Okay, well, I'm here for my last check. So do you know where he is? He's not here, so come back later. Okay, so do you know where he puts the checks so I can sign for it? Do I look like your office assistant? I said he's not here, man. Just come back later. Is this for me? Yo, you don't work here anymore. Man, we finally got a brother here who actually needs this job so he can take care of his family, so you can take your white privileged self and bounce up out of here. Okay, I'm gonna call him real quick. Yo, I said he's not here. Just leave. Give me my phone back. Dang. You really gonna do him like that? Man, you saw what happened. I had to protect myself. All right, what you got going on after this? You gonna watch the game? You gonna catch the game tonight? I'm a try, man. I might catch the fourth quarter. You know, my wife, I got to stop at a grocery store. My wife, she pregnant. Yeah, yeah, yeah, man. I done told you about betting on those games. Oh, Carson, hold on. What happened to you?

I know you're probably not about to believe a word I'm about to say, but I can't go another day without saying it. Like, I'm so sorry. It was really stupid, childish, immature. I was so angry when you broke up with me, Jay, like, and then you started talking to other women. I was jealous. I wanted you to hurt just as bad as I was hurting, but I was 100% wrong.

I made this apology video and I'm going to post it today and let everyone know how sorry I am. I mean, I'll be embarrassed and I'll look so stupid, but it's nothing compared to how much I probably embarrassed you. Here, press play and take a look at it before I post it. Wait, what?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. I don't know what's going on here, but I need your attention, please, okay? All right, everybody, take out your textbooks. Turn to page 15, please. Hey. Respect. Hello? Can I help you? I'm Julia, Maria's mom. Oh my gosh. Hi, how are you? As well as can be expected. I hope you don't mind me catching up with you here. Principal Hanway gave me your information. She said she tried to call, but you weren't answering. And I just, I really needed to talk to you. No worries at all. I'm just on my way to the gym, but I have time. Please, what's going on? I'm not going to hold you long, I just, me and Maria never really had a great relationship. And when her father went to prison, things really got bad between us. But over these past weeks before she, I started noticing she was acting different. You know, she was reading more. I even saw her praying. She seemed more at peace. You know, like nothing could bother her no more. One day she told me that she's never gonna give up on me. That as long as she's alive, she still has hope. And she's no longer with us, but she did something for me that no one's ever done before. She gave me hope. And Mr. Ryans, I just, I just wanted to let you know that you have such a big impact on these kids and I thank you for helping my baby. Without even knowing it, helping me, too. Come here. It's good to see you guys, too. Y'all been good? Yeah, I've been good. I wonder why Mr. Ryans want us to put our chairs like this? I don't know, probably a game. Something he would have. Sheesh, Carson, what happened to your eye? I don't want to talk about that. All right. Wait, so, each of you guys got that email from Mr. Ryans, too? Would we be here if we didn't? I guess not. But where's he at? He hasn't shown up yet. Do you see him in that chair? Come on, man, you're supposed to be the smart one. He is the smart one. What's going on? Give me your fire, woman, come on, man. How you guys doing? Hey, hey, hey. Good to see all of y'all here. Man, look at them smiling faces. James, you on time? Hey, man, it's a new day. Listen, I just wanted to get you guys here because I wanted to apologize. I'm sorry. You know, I feel like I let you down, but somebody reminded me that there's people counting on me to be strong. And those people where you. You know, Mr. Ryans, you don't always have to be strong for us. Remember you said that we're all in this together. I mean, I know that you're here to help us, but we're all here to help you if you need it. I appreciate that. I really do, from all of you guys. And with that being said, I got news. Good news. Ooh. So the sessions are back on. Woo! Woo hoo. Absolutely. So check it out, look, we're gonna get this thing popping every single day. I want to make sure that you guys make it through the school year on top, all right? Fantastic. See, I was hoping something like this was going to partake. So let me go ahead. What's he got? What's he got? Relax, relax, relax. Is that an answering machine? Indeed, it is. Let me see that bad boy right there. What in the world? Where did you find this thing? It was in my father's attic. What? I know, man. I couldn't believe my eyes, but I snatched it. Hopefully he don't know I took it. But, anyway, so I, my idea was this, I feel like we should all leave a positive message on here, you know? 'Cause I feel like we family now, and I don't know, that's what you said families used to do. Well, family still does that today and it's gonna start today, right after our little activity. All right, sessions start now, all right? Yes! So, I wanted us to get in this little circle 'cause I just wanted to catch up. You know, it's been awhile. You know, let's talk about your week. James, how's it been? You know it's crazy, right? Everybody know I lost my woman, but I ain't no quitter. So I ended up getting two. I said it. All right, all right. Hey. Hey. So, you met with the kids today? I did. That's good. Listen, I know I already apologized to you and I just feel like it's not enough. I wanted to say that I'm sorry again. You know, Donna, you didn't deserve the way I spoke to you. I know you were just caught up in the middle of all this. Nothing is your fault and I'm sorry. It's okay. I understand. I've been praying so hard for you every day. Thank you. I appreciate that. And, I mean, God's been listening, that's for sure. I missed you. I missed you, too. So, is he here? Yeah, he's coming. Okay. So, are you sure you're ready to do this? Yeah. He's coming. Okay, he's coming. It's okay. Hey, Leshon, listen, man. Don't be scared, okay? Relax. I needed you to be here today 'cause I wanted to tell you something. I realized that you made a mistake, a very, very big mistake. But, you know, I realized that everybody, everybody deserves a second chance. When I look at you, man, I see in your eyes that you've had a hard life. I know you've had a lot of bad things going on. Listen, I wanted to ask you something. Will you forgive me? Forgive you for what? Will you forgive me? I was the one that was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come here, come here, come here. I didn't mean to hurt her. It's okay, I forgive you. I forgive you. It's okay.

So she's in LA already, like right now. That's crazy. You talked to her? Yeah, we've been talking, we've been in communication. So she's doing really good right now.
