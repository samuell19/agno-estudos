BLOCK 2 PICTURES PRESENTS A JET TONE FILMS PRODUCTION Starring GONG LI and CHANG CHEN Directed by WONG KAR WAI EROS - THE HAND PALACE HOTEL How are you feeling today? Not too bad. Don't come here anymore. It's contagious. No, it's all right. I've made the alterations. Forget it. That man's already left. Just look at me. I'm afraid I won't be able to wear it. That's not true. You'll get well. Shall we try it on? No. I'm sure you've done a marvelous job. Do you still remember... how we met? Yes. And do you remember my hand? Yes, I do. Excuse me, which way is Apartment 1? To your left. - This way? - Yes. Who is it? I'm looking for Miss Hua. And you are? I'm Mr. Jin's apprentice. He sent me here. Mr. Zhao, you're leaving already? Ma'am, Mr. Jin's apprentice is here. Send him in. You may go in. You can go in now. Miss Hua. So, you're Jin's apprentice. - Yes. - What's your name? Just call me Xiao Zhang. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Stand still. Put your hands down. What's going on there? Nothing. Take off your pants. Take them off. Or would you rather I call your boss? Off with them. And that too. Nothing, you say? Come here. Give me your hand. Never touched a woman before, have you? Then how can you be a tailor? You'll be touching many women. If that's how you are... who'd want you for a tailor? I'm nice to you, aren't I? Good. Now listen. Your boss is getting old. He said you have talent. One day, you'll become my tailor. Remember this feeling... and you'll make me beautiful clothes. Oh, Miss Hua. Congratulations. I heard you're getting married. Such a happy event. Of course we know about it. Xiao Zhang? He went out. Right. The festival is coming up, so we're rather busy. Please, you must not say that. You know Xiao Zhang is devoted to you. He doesn't care about any other clients. There's nothing he wouldn't do for your clothes. Yes, right. When he comes back, I'll send him right over. Yes, yes. I have made myself very clear. I'm not going to work from today on. Who's coming? What does Mr. Cheung have to do with me? There are other girls in the club. Let them have fun with other girls. I'm not getting married. You knew that. He has a wife. So what? There are only two solutions. Either I get paid off or I keep seeing him. I don't want to support some pretty boy. It's his pleasure to spend money on me. I won't deprive myself of nice things. I'll be looking for a new apartment this week. I'll talk to you again in a few days. I won't forget you. Ma'am, Mr. Zhao is here. You're crazy. Didn't I tell you not to come here again? What if someone sees you? Who'll take care of me? I'll take care of you. Really? How? What am I going to eat? You can eat me. Bastard. That's enough. We still have plenty of time. You go on home. I'll call you. Okay? - Okay, I'm off. - Go on. Mr. Zhao, leaving already? Yes, I've got things to do. Goodbye. Ying. If Mr. Zhao comes again, tell him I'm not home. Yes. - Has Xiao Zhang been around? - No. Call him. Tell him to hurry over. Lover? What are you talking about? Oh, him. He's my cousin. Stop listening to rumors, will you? Mr. Zhang, where have you been? Is Miss Hua awake? - He looks like my lover? - She's waiting for you. He's a bore. Listen, I've found an apartment. When you come over this evening, bring your checkbook. I need to put down a deposit. - What? - Ma'am, coffee. - Is Xiao Zhang here? - Yes. Give him these fabrics. Tell him Mr. Zhu bought them in France. Tell him to be extra careful. Give him a few dumplings for the festival. Yes, ma'am. Hello? What did you say? Not coming? Are you scared? Scared of your wife, I'd say. Scared of me? That's perfectly fine. If you are scared, then don't come. Miss Hua wants you to have these. She made these dumplings herself. - Please thank her for me. - Yes. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. LIFE TAILOR CO. You've spent hours taking a shower in there. Have you finished yet? Right away. Mr. Zhang. You're early. Is Miss Hua awake? She's speaking with Mr. Zhao. How can I help you? Her clothes are finished. I'd like to see her for a fitting. Give them to me. It looks like it'll be a while. All right. If there are any problems, please have her call me. - Yes. - I'll be going, then. Will you stop it? How many times have I told you? We're cousins. We are not lovers. I know what you're up to. Think you're done with me. Is that it? You want to give me the boot. It's not that easy. Let me tell you something. If you don't settle things to my satisfaction... I'll show you. Ma'am, Mr. Zhang is still waiting. He has some nerve showing up. Making a mess of these clothes. I don't want any of them. I'm through with him! You dare to play again. I won't let you win. Xiao Zhang is out. Who's calling? Oh, Ying, how are you? This is Jin. He went out. What? Miss Hua wants to see him? I'll send him right over when he comes back. Don't mention it. Yes, yes. Hello, Mr. Shao? It's me. You didn't recognize my voice. Heartless. You didn't go out today? I'm fine. I just called to say hello. These last couple of days... I've missed you so much. Who? Oh, him. I haven't seen him for a long time. It's been ages. Mr. Shao. I'm going back to work in a couple of days. I get so bored staying at home... doing nothing. Mr. Shao, now that I'm working again... you must come visit me at the club. Promise? It's a deal. Are you free later? Let's meet tonight. Where would you like to go? Sure. But you must come. You promised. See you tonight. This isn't too tight, is it? Have I put on weight? Just a little. You used to be a 23. Now, you're... Just under 24. Use the old measurements. I'm going back to work. I'll lose weight. Oh, no, please don't misunderstand. I'm not pressing you to settle the bill. I heard you're ill, and I called to see how you're feeling. Yes, yes. Oh, no, please, it's okay. You're an old client. Yes, yes. Please get some rest. Let me know when it's convenient. I'll send Xiao Zhang over. Right. Yes, yes. Goodbye. Who the hell do you think you are? You're a fucking whore! You're not what you used to be. If you haven't got money, we have nothing to talk about! Who is it? It's me. It's you again, Mr. Zhang. Is Miss Hua here? I'm sorry. She's out again. How can I help you? It's okay. Do you know when she'll be back? Not really. You'd better come another day. You're back. What did she say? She's ill. Told me to come back in a few days. Nonsense. It's been over six months. I don't think she can hold up much longer. She has no rich lovers to keep her, and she doesn't work. With all her expensive habits and supporting that pretty little boyfriend, it's not easy. Go back in a couple of days. We need to have the bill settled. Take these clothes. If anyone wants them... sell them... and keep the money. I still owe you money anyway. No. It's okay. I mean, these clothes... Why don't you keep them? Most of them are still brand-new. I can't wear them all. I'm going on a trip. I don't want to take that many things with me. And it's such a shame to leave them behind. Go on, take them. Where are you going? I'm going to... I'm going to Europe. I'll make a new start. That's the place for me. You've made me so many clothes... and I've never thanked you properly. Here. I know you enjoy having a drink. Here. Drink up. Who are you looking for? Is Miss Hua here, please? She's moved out. Would you know where to? No. I don't. Thank you. Who was that? Someone looking for Miss Hua. I told him she's moved out. PALACE HOTEL The Royal Observatory is now raising an alert about Typhoon Kate. It's centered about 300 nautical miles from Hong Kong, moving west-northwest. Hello. Yes. Xiao Zhang? He went out. Who's calling, please? Miss Hua? Oh, yes. Yes, yes. This is Jin. Oh, I'm so terribly sorry. I didn't recognize your voice. We haven't heard from you in ages. We really miss you. Yes, yes. So you're back. Where are you staying? Oh, yes, yes. Could I have your phone number, please? Yes, yes. Good. When Xiao Zhang gets back, I'll send him right over. Right. Yes, yes. Goodbye. You're back. There was a phone call for you. Did he leave his name? It's Miss Hua. She's back. Where is Miss Hua's room, please? Upstairs, end of the corridor. Thanks. Have some tea. It's been so many years. You still look the same. You haven't changed a bit. Neither have you. Liar. But that's rather kind of you. I thought you went to Europe. I had no money. I was having a very hard time. I made that up... so people wouldn't laugh at me... and to save face. How have you been? Doing well? Got yourself a wife yet? No. Why not? No one wants me. Why don't you find me one? How about me? You think I'm not good enough, don't you? No, of course not. Then we have a deal. Okay. You're so good to me. Could you... make me another dress? What kind do you want? Tell me. Something really pretty. I have an old client from America. He's still very fond of me. He's asked me out on a date. I think... this may be my very last chance. I'd like you to help me. Sure. This is all I have. Take it. I'll pay you the rest when there's more. No, keep it. I still have your clothes. Most of them are brand-new. All they need is a little alteration. Don't waste money. Of course, I know you're keeping for them. But I can't wear them anymore. I've lost weight. You'll probably need to take my measurements again. There's no need. I know your figure well. I'll just use my hands. Do you know where Miss Hua went? No. Try the waterfront. She's usually there at this hour. What for? Making a living. She's not going out there for fun. Certainly not in this rain. Okay. I understand. I'll come right away. Is that enough? Who is she to you? We're friends. Friends? You're quite a friend, I'd say. Always paying her rent. She's really ill. You should take her to a doctor. How are you feeling today? Not too bad. Don't come here anymore. It's contagious. No, it's all right. I've made the alterations. Forget it. That man's already left. Just look at me. I'm afraid I won't be able to wear it. That's not true. You'll get well. Shall we try it on? No. I'm sure you've done a marvelous job. Do you still remember... how we met? Yes. And do you remember my hand? Yes, I do. You must have hated me that day. No, I didn't. I want to thank you. If it hadn't been for your hand, I wouldn't have become a tailor. Forget about me. Go love some other woman and be good to her. Come closer. You've always been so good to me. And I've never repaid you. I'm afraid I won't have the chance. I've lost everything. I used to have this body, but it's no good anymore. All that's left of it is this pair of hands. You don't mind, do you? Where have you been? I was just looking for you. I went to see Miss Hua off. Oh... She's gone? Yes. That's fast. Yes. There were a lot of people at the airport. They all went to see her off. She was so happy... and so beautiful. She didn't have it easy, did she? Two years ago, I thought she was finished. Then an opportunity comes along and she's on her feet again. Who would've guessed? Yes. Who would have guessed? Have you finished Miss Lau's dress? What's wrong?
