2009 NFL season is underway. The Cleveland Browns host the Miami Dolphins. Heisman Trophy winner and first-round draft pick Bobby Coleman is in as running back. Handoff, Coleman. Oh, and Coleman, right off the bat, fumbles it... That's my dad, Bobby Coleman. Not how anyone expected his career to start. Might have been his first fumble, but it wasn't his last. Because of that, I ended up moving around...a lot. I turned six in Indianapolis. Eight was in Chicago. Bobby Coleman coughs up the ball for the Bears, and the Raiders recover. Then we were on to Jacksonville for my tenth, but you can probably guess what happened. And then the football comes loose. The big 1-3 was in Minneapolis. I wasn't there long enough to make friends, but I did perfect my Madden skills. Twelve years after that first fumble, we ended up in Atlanta. What I didn't know was, I was about to have the weirdest year of my life. As the Falcons close out the preseason, the big question really is, will Bobby Coleman-- Keisha, why are you watching that? Come on. Don't listen to 'em. Listen to me. They don't know what they're talking about. Well, I hope so, because we've already moved so many times, and it's a lot! Look, I don't like picking up and shuffling to a new city either. I know one thing-- if Anderson Fisher wasn't on the team, I'd definitely make the roster. No, you need to stop worrying about everyone else and maybe start thinking about what life might look like -after football. -Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you just use those words I think I heard you say? Coaches seen me put in the work this preseason. Come on, baby. I've been killing myself to be ready for this season, and you think I'm done. But I'm just getting started. No, baby, that's not what I said. But I can't take another trade. So that better be look at this house, fall in love with it. We can grow old here. -Okay. -Okay. Second and twelve, versus Coleman. And back to the Lions. And he'll play four at the 27-yard line. Whoa! Callie, jeez! Not cool. Girl, that's my move. I saw you in the reflection. -You did? -Mm-hmm. You really gotta step up your game. -I guess so. - Yeah. -So no more cinnamon rolls. -What do you mean? If you wanna make the roster, you gotta be at peak physical condition. Oh, come on, Callie, it's the last day of preseason! Uh-uh, no buts. Look, we've been down this road before. First it's cinnamon rolls. Then late-night Cap'n Crunch. Then I find you hoarding Oreos under the bathroom sink. Cookies taste so much better when it's secret. It's not very hygienic. Everybody got their vices. -I'm just saying! You sit in here all day and you play video games. Am I wrong? No, that's why I have a high OBR in Madden. You know what I was doing when I was your age? Oh, when I was your age, I used to... -go outside. Just saying, it wouldn't hurt to get out there and make a few friends. You know? I know it hasn't been easy, all this moving around. You mean it's not every girl's dream to skip town every two years like her family's a bunch of wanted bank robbers? -A fair hit. -Mm-hmm. But I feel different about Atlanta, baby girl. I'm telling you, I think we gonna be here for a while. Yeah, I've heard that one before. But it would be nice to finally call a city home for once. -Guess what? -Hmm? I couldn't agree more. I don't wanna keep being the reason we move. Good. -Oh, can I show you something? -Of course. Okay, so I've been working on some predictive analytics to help prepare you for your first game. Okay, I have no idea what that is, but I love the sound of it. All right, so basically, it all comes down to 0's and 1's. -Okay. -I catalogued all the Falcons styles from the past season. They're efficient, they get a 1. Non-efficient, they get a 0. So I loaded that data into this spreadsheet and coded an algorithm in Python that can predict... -What? Just--I'm just so proud of you. You and your numbers. -You just keep getting smarter. -Are you--are you listening? -Yes, Daughter, I'm listening. -Okay, so... Time for school! * Ha, ha, ha Get it, get it * * I got the bag, I'm runnin' with it * * This one's rippin' Hit the curb like it's ready * * Get it, get it * I got the car, there's no limit * ...pass to the end zone. But oh my goodness! Last minute, Coleman decides to lateral to All-Star Anderson Fisher! Whoo! No, no, no, no, whoo-ah, none of that. Time out. I'm not even pretending to pass the ball to All-Star Anderson Fisher. And you, I see you're trying to be slick. You're not about to drive, no. You only had your license three weeks. I'm not trying to have a panic attack. All right, fine. But I do get to play my Spotify on the way. * Get it, get it * I got the card, there's no limit * * In demand now, going now by the minute * * Get it, get it * We get it, we get it Here we go, let's have some fun. Anyone else feel the breeze from that wiff? It's okay, you got this. - You're doing great. -They are always like this. Bunch of jerks. Ugh, I wish someone would teach them a lesson. For real. Is there a remedial gym class, maybe? Here we go! Here's the pitch! Put her out of her misery! She's gonna break home plate with her butt. Remember, eye on the ball. Gonna get this. You're actually gonna try again? No extra charge for the cold showers! Bobby, you've been a real workhorse for us this preseason. We've been impressed by your hustle and determination. And that's why we wanna keep you right here in the lineup. Yes! I knew it, Coach. -But on the practice squad. -Okay. Listen, you're a hard worker and a veteran leader, an ideal locker room guy for us. Right, right. I mean, I love the locker room. And great water pressure in the shower, by the way. I mean, wow. But just as an idea, Coach, you know... wouldn't it be better if that hard work and veteran leadership you speak about was being used on the field, right? Out there, not...in there. You know? All right, listen, Bobby. And, uh, don't take this the wrong way, but... your Heisman days are far behind you. And with the league trending past firsts, we're just gonna keep two backs active. So, we've got Allen, and obviously Anderson's a no-brainer. Ha, ha! Are you kidding me, Coach? I mean, the guy's a phenom. He is, he is. Well, thank you, Coach, you know? For giving it to me straight, you know? With no chaser. I can appreciate that. I knew you'd take the news well. Baby, I need you to take a deep breath. I know it hurts, but it's just temporary. And so what? Anderson Fisher had one great year. It's not like it makes him the face of the Falcons. Baby, are you gonna be okay? Yeah. 'Cause I don't want you crashing the car 'cause you can't see the road through your tears. Yo! Keish, I gotta go, okay? I'll see ya. -Yo, yo, yo. -Hey, Anderson, what's up, man? -You see that banner up there? -Oh yeah. It's a big me! -Look how big I am, dog! -I know, huh. Yo, you know, maybe next time, I'll be posing for the wax museum version of myself. What stance do you think I should do? -That's cool. -Hold up, hold up. -Yeah, that's cool. -Are you all right? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, man, there's just allergies, you know? It must be pollinating the whole parking lot, though. -What? -Yeah, yeah. -Word. -Yeah, word. -Who? -You know... bees. -Bzzz? -Bees. Bzzz. Right. Listen, man, crying ain't nothin' to be ashamed of. Embrace your feelings. You wanna hug it out? No. I'm a good hugger, right? -It's tight. -Yeah-- But it's not too tight, all right? You can feel safe and secure in these arms, I promise. I hear you. Maybe next time, all right? -Done? -Yep, that's it. I wanted to remind you about my end of preseason party at my crib, right? You and the whole family is invited. I want everyone to get the whole Anderson Fisher experience. Well, I'm not too sure, you know, what we got going on or whatever, but I'll check with the wife. You don't wanna miss out on these finger foods. Oh, you just gonna roll that down, huh? I'm talking deconstructed carnival fare, all right? -But listen, Sniffles. -Hm? Go get some 24-hour relief, man. -Hey, cloud that up. -Uh-huh. -Suck it up, dry it out. -Yeah, dry it out. - You got it, baby. -All right, man. Yeah. Hey, new girl! Wait up! It's Callie, right? Uh, yeah, that's actually my name, yeah. I'm Kayla. And this is Zoe and Margo. We just had to ask. How did you pull that off? I didn't-- I didn't do anything. Right, right. Yeah, no, I'm gonna need every single detail of what just what down. So, we were talking, and we were wondering, um, if--if, you know--if-- it's up to you-- If you feel like it would be in your best interest-- -We're on a robotics team. - Yeah. Robotics? Like, you guys build robots? Yep! I'm team captain. We meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4:30. And based off of what we saw today-- that thing that you definitely didn't do-- well, whoever did do that might wanna come check us out. Okay. Yeah, yeah, cool. I mean, um, whoever did that would probably say thanks for the invite and, uh, they'll think about it. Awesome, yeah. Thanks. * Hey, hey, hey * Celebrate, every day is a party * * Celebrate, every day shake your body * * Celebrate, let 'em wait in the lobby * * Celebrate, every day is a party * * Yeah, we gonna celebrate * Keep it goin', it's gonna be late * * Uh, we give the good energy * Hey, hey, hey, hey * Everybody got their hands up * Ain't no room on the world for a dancer * * If they ain't here, go ahead and call your fans up * * Then telegram to tell them to bring a camera 'cause * * We about to burn it down Bobby Coleman! Hey, hey. What's up? How are you doin'? Hey, you let me know if this music too loud, all right? This must be Callie and the beautiful Keisha. Cheeseburger on a stick? Beef and cheddar tucked in a hash brown ball, fried golden brown. -Sounds delicious. -Yes, please. You see, they got good taste. Welcome to my wonderland! Custom built by the same guy who did three of Robert Downey Jr's six houses. I have to show you my home theater. Oh no, man, we're cool right here. It just got installed. Guys in there playing Madden right now. I should warn you, Callie, she's mean on that Madden. -Takes no prisoners. -Oh yeah? She must be playing as me. You know I got the overall 100 rating, right? -You know, AF keep it 100! -Yeah. Except nobody's got a perfect 100 rating in Madden . Uh, Dad, he actually does. Yeah, they're saying I'm the first one. You know, pioneer and all of that. You know, create milestones and all of that. Uh, what about you? What's, uh... What's your rating? -72? -He's a 67. Dang! I mean, that's tough. Well, you know, at least on Madden, you're not stuck in a locker room. You're actually on the field with me. Behold, the home theater! Hey, yo, listen up! This is Callie Coleman. She got next, all right? Go easy on her. More like I'll go easy on them. Whoa! Let me show you how it works at the crib. So yeah, you know, the floors are imported zebra wood. You look up, ceiling, white marble. I said, whatever they gave Michelangelo, give me that. That's me. It's a little embarrassing, uh... So they made some bobbleheads of me. I got a couple advance copies. So yeah, that's my knitting room. Uh, a lot of people don't know this, but I'm actually really good at making mittens. This is my rookie year single-season rushing record. Had to put it somewhere. You know, Anderson, pride is one of the seven deadly sins. Yeah, well, so is gluttony, but that ain't stop you. No, just messing with you, man. It's probably 'cause the shirt's small. You know, I'll be honest with you. I actually thought this rushing record was gonna be yours the year you won the Heisman. -Word? -Yeah, man. -You were my favorite player. -Yeah? Yeah, don't doubt, man. We all loved you. The whole fifth grade. Yo, let me get those deconstructed cotton candies! -I'll get one too. - Yo, hold up! Whoo! I warned you I was an expert in that. Did this girl invent the game? How did you get this good? I think the real question is how did you get so bad? Whoa! It's all right. Maybe next time, man. Everyone say bye! - Bye! -Bye. Have a good one. All right, um, who's next? Anybody else? -Uh, uh, all right. -Yo, Anderson? I think it's only, you know, fair that the man who owns the home "the-a-ta" takes a turn. What you say? All right, cool, cool, let's get it, let's get it. Let's see what you got, Lil Coleman. * This is the beginnin' of the new world, baby * Whoa! Get him, Callie! Button's stuck, man! * Superman did it * Passion of a G * Sittin' like a soldier No, no, no, no! I pressed-- Hey, yo, come on. My control-- I was lagging, man. That's tough. Is it rude for me to clown the host at the party? Or should I-- Hey. Are you gonna let her fight all your battles or... you gonna come play me yourself? I got no problem with it. Long as you don't mind getting beat by two Colemans in one day. Okay, chill out, chill out, chill out. You know what? Since Bobby Coleman here has seniority, right? A lot of seniority. He don't look old. I'ma let you play as me, Anderson Fisher. Man, shut up. I ain't gonna play as you. I'm gonna play as Bobby Coleman. And I'm gonna school ya. Hey, Dad. You gotta admit. It's kind of funny that you lost by 86 points. I mean, I've never seen it. Well, look, I-I don't find the humor. And a man humiliated me in front of all my peers. That was a direct attack on my entire person. -Oh! Your entire person? -Yes, Keisha. That was an attack on my manhood. And I'm supposed to just sit there and laugh like it's some kind of game? Nuh-uh. It's literally a video game! Isn't that right, Bobblehead Anderson? Um, that is correct, Keisha. Keisha, he gave you that and you didn't burn it? Never say no to a swag bag, baby. -Wait, wait! -He's comin'. Uh, uh! Uh, uh! You better get some ice for this sore loser! Poor guy's only a 67, and mad. Ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah, okay. Just laugh, huh? -Oh, that's how it's gonna be. Hang you up. Make fun of Bobby. Make fun. Bobby Coleman, everybody laughing. -Don't, babe. -Anderson is not so bad. He gave me a copy of his Madden . -He gave you what? - He signed it. And he signed it? But--no, stop! I'm not lookin' at the road. I'm about to pull over. Give me the game. Bobby, give me the game. Y'all have gone crazy if you think I'm bringing this to my house. This game is not coming into my house! Throwing it out! What? What? No! -Wait, wait. -Throwing it away. -Dad! Seriously? -Yes, seriously! No, it's just a game! -No, it's more than a game. -Stop! -What are you doing? -What is wrong with you? -We were just joking! -Don't you get it, Keish? That man has the life we were supposed to have. Had I broken that rushing record and gotten that big contract, that would be our house! No, but instead, I've been dragging you all around the country for what? Huh? Bobby's a big disappointment! I'm a joke! I got no endorsement deals! I'm not even in the conversation! It should've been us! What the... Are y'all okay!? Callie! Callie, look at me! Am I, am I, am I, am I alive? I'm alive! -Can you hear me? -Is she alive? You okay? You okay? Yeah, I'm actually-- I'm actually fine. Thank God. That was crazy! What is wrong with you two? We could be in the ER right now. Don't you have anything to say to each other? Well, Bobby? -What? She started it! -She started it!? Baby, you are a grown man. My bad for making fun of your rating in Madden . I'm sorry. My bad for losing my temper. I'm sorry. Well, I'm gonna have to see a hug or something. Like, you mean it! -Sorry. -All right, let's get inside. Wait. Come on, baby, it's raining so hard! Come on, let's go! It's still perfect. Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Whoo! Ha, ha, ha. All right, Chris, one more time! Hey, man. You know, at your age, it's not even about finishing first. It's about finishing at all. We are all proud of you. You know, it's like watching an old dog go up some stairs. Like, you don't think he'll make it, but somehow the little rascal digs deep? That's you, man! You're digging deep! Starters! You guys take a break. Practice squad, let's run some formations. EA Sports-- It's in the game. Let's go, Madden! Let's go, Madden! Let's get that rating up. * Got your best friend hanging out the arm door * * You got game like I'm droppin' me a console * * No, I don't swim, but I give a long stroke * * Can I flex * While you're giving me the best * * Get up in your gets while I soak up my success * * Gettin' tokens for your stress * * I'll be making all the checks * * Any time you see me step on the stage * -Woo! -Yeah! Yeah, Bobby! Somebody ate their Wheaties today, boy! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I like that! I like that! I've never seen him do that before. Never. * Everything has gotta be cool when we livin' some fun * * Feel it in your bones * You ain't gonna feel it 'til I'm done * * 'Caught up in your feelin's like you're froze * * And everything around you gettin' cold * * Caught up in my feelings, now I'm froze * Yeah! Old dog teaching the young pup new things out here today! -That's luck. -Bobby? Let's have a chat in my office. Hey, yo. Yes sir, Coach! Callie! Hey! We have been talking about that sprinkler stunt non stop! -Really? -Yeah. Well, I mean, it wasn't that impressive. Smart and humble. I'm gonna need you to be a little cockier, though, like stand firm in your power and abilities, yeah? That's Oliver. He's a little reserved. Doesn't talk, really. More of a...supportive head nod guy. Right, Oliver? I know, I know, sorry I'm late. I didn't--oh, whoa. Hey. Hi. Look, sorry for running into you and all that. -You good? -Yeah. I'm Nate. Nathaniel. But you can just call me Nate. Everybody else calls me that. Okay! So, Callie, you wanna see our robot from last year? Sure. Definitely more heart than function. Yeah. But now that we got the LeBron of robotics, we goin' all the way. Yeah, that's, uh... That's a lot of pressure. No, just all of our hopes and dreams on our shoulders. Light work. Oh, um, I got to take this. Sorry, guys. Yeah. Hey, Dad. What's up? Kind of busy with school right now. Well, come home. We're celebrating! That's right, your daddy got moved up to the roster. No more practice squad! Ha, ha! Okay, I'll... I'll see you soon. * Hey, feeling good So Rodney comes at me from the right, babe, right? And I'm--I'm like, nope. So then I juke left, kind of like this. Whoo! He don't have a chance, right? So then I get it on-- Wait--I mean, you get the idea. Yes. You know what? I think the assistant coach got some on the video. -So, I'll be right back. -Okay. So, how was robotics? Everybody seems to be pretty cool so far. I mean, that's great! No offense to your dad, but... you definitely get your brains from me. Okay! Check it out! Look at this, huh? -What!? -How cool is that? -50-yard punt return. -Oh, oh-- Wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta fast forward. -Look at that, huh? -Oh my gosh! Dive and catch? I'm so proud of you! Thank you. I recorded my game so I can show you how I'm improving your rating, but...look at this. These plays are exactly the same as what you did in practice. -Whoa. -Yeah. I mean, you know, it was better in real life, though, because everything I did, you can see Anderson Fisher's face. Every move I make, he was like, wha? Jukin' left and right? Oh, baby girl, I can't sleep. Maybe the lightning somehow... No, no, no. I don't know. It's just, like... real you was doing the exact same thing fake you was doing at the same time real you was doing it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you mumbling about? I...I don't know. No, that's insane! Video games can't affect real life. Unless they can. Then it's like... Whoa. I think we need to run an experiment. -Say what? -Your first game. What if I played as you in Madden ? When that lightning hit, it changed something. It changed your brain. No, Dad, let's just see what happens. That's crazy. What's the harm in trying? * I don't swim, but I give a long stroke * * Can I flex * While you get up in the rest * Get up in the gets while I soak up my success * * Gettin' tokens for your stress * * I'll be making all the checks * * Any time you see me step on the stage * It's the start of a new season with one sold-out Mercedes-Benz Stadium. And Tony, here we go. * Caught up in your feelin's like you froze * * Everything around you gettin'-- * Well, on the opening drive, Jim, look for the Falcons to establish the run early today, especially with Anderson Fisher, who had a sensational rookie season last year. It's a big story at running back, no doubt, Tony. Anderson Fisher, the young star, looking to duplicate his success from last year. And Taylor will start out in the gun, here, and quickly some pressure off the edge, and down he goes! Taylor, oh my gosh! Well, that's a rough start right there. Fisher, that's your assignment. And, you know, he's only in the second year. Mistakes are gonna happen. A mistake by Fisher. And now it's second down. Twenty, hut! And they give it to Fisher. He finds a hole, but coughs it up. And the Falcons recover, but my goodness, what a tough start for Anderson Fisher. I agree with Coach Evans here. To miss pass protection on the first play and then fumble on the second? Here we go with the veteran Bobby Coleman. A bold move, no doubt, Ton. A surprising move. So from the young buck to the veteran, Coleman here. Third down for the Falcons. Bobby! Bobby, you're on the wrong side! Bobby's gotta move over, Jim. Yeah, there ya go, Bobby. Ready in motion, motion! And Taylor, he's gonna go up top on third and long. He's looking. He has nobody down field open. He's gonna check this down to Coleman. Coleman with a nice little sidestep. I mean, look at the spin move by Bobby Coleman. Bobby Coleman is making some moves-- Ah! Oh, excuse me. --college, he was the guy. How happy is he right now, Jim? You gotta look at that. Bobby Coleman showing off that Heisman Trophy. He's got great in...stincts. Instincts weren't great when you put a wall in front of him. Runs into the wall! No way! He was so amped up. I was right! This is really impressive. I can't believe it worked. Six to nothing, Atlanta. Bobby Coleman, his glory days being reclaimed for a moment, here. Yeah! He's been the story so far today, Tony. He's going to reverse course. What is happening here? If I'm Anderson Fisher, I'm worried... Another sidestep, and there he goes! One more time, folks! Bobby Coleman, fourth touchdown of the day. Even blowing a kiss to his wife, Keisha, in the crowd. The shovel pass, and guess who? Bobby Coleman one more time. And the Panthers' defense is playing well. But Bobby and the Falcons are playing better. It's off the charts! This time, Coleman splits out wide. They throw it to him. He's got three Panthers ahead of him. What's he doing? He's going backwards. No! What are you doing? Oh, look at what he's doing. What a move! He went backwards to go forwards. Bobby Coleman is having quite the day. And with touchdown number six, tied with Gale Sayers for the most touchdowns ever scored in a single game. I don't even know what else to say. I can't say anything about his performance. He scored six touchdowns... You were right, but... This wasn't part of the plan. Look at this. He's breaking it down in all sorts of ways. But this is definitely gonna get a flag. And that's gonna be a 15-yard penalty for taunting. But after all that he's done in this game, I think the fans are gonna give him a pass on this one. Hey, he's ahead of the game. Joining him, his wife's got it down too. His family has to be on cloud nine. It's inspirational, Jim. I mean, truly, this guy was on the practice squad three days ago. Whoo! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Yeah! Yeah! That's how we play! That's how we play! Great job today! Great job today! Listen up! Listen up. I am so proud of you guys. You play like that, we gonna win a lot of football games. Execution, determination, everything we talk about -in dirty bird football. Let me see that game ball. Speaking of that, today, a certain someone showed he still got some wheels. And, and, and, and! Some questionable dance moves. You know who I'm talking about. Bobby Coleman, hell of a job! Thank you. Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Those six touchdowns gave me life. -Six! - Six! I still can't believe it! Oh, well you gotta believe it, baby. See, 'cause Bobby Coleman is turning back the clock, baby. -Hey! -That's right, that's right. It just felt like, um... Like you were possessed out there or something. -It kind of felt like that. - Yeah! It did. Just a vessel of some... greater power acting through you. Oh, oh, oh, okay! You might get the life you always wanted. -Yeah! -Yes! -Amen! -Amen! -Amen! - Amen! * Nah, nah, nah-nah, nah * Nah, nah, nah, nah * You think you can play me * You think you can play me * * You ain't gotta come for me Okay, hold on, hold on. * I got shooters riding in Mercedes * -Bring it up, bring it up. -Bring it up? Okay! Okay, so in honor of our brand-new season, I have a little surprise for everyone. Homemade robot iPhone cases! And these originally designed T-shirts. Each phone case has a robot that matches your T-shirts. You know, to your individual personalities. Go, PossumBots. Aren't they perfect? I mean, it's a little much, but I'll take it. That's what I like to hear. Yeah, I appreciate this. This is--this is dope. But y'all, I got the video all set up. Y'all ready to see what we doin' this year? -Ooh, yes! -Yeah. Welcome to the 2022 First Robotics Competition. And this year's game? Toxic Takedown. The Earth has been overwhelmed by toxic waste. Using your removal droids, you'll collect condensed toxic waste and launch it into one of four depositories. The planet is counting on you! All right, guys. We should probably start working on this right now. Or...we could procrastinate. * Let's go * Put your hands up in the sky * Just keeping the dream alive Oh! Whoa! Yo! You good? Whoa... That was wild. Yeah, I just got a little distracted. Was it my face? Look, I keep meaning to tell you not to be so distracted. Can you get over yourself and help me out? All right, I got you. I did not expect these tacos to be so good. Right? I've been here for almost four years and I'm still not sick of them. My dad's in the military, so we move around a lot. But good food always helps. Mm-hmm. Four years is impressive. Yeah, the longest I ever lived somewhere was three. But that was Jacksonville, so I was kind of happy my dad got traded, so, yeah. But, um, hey, thanks for making me feel like a part of the team. Hey, you're a great addition. -Yeah? -Yeah. You know, my family has always revolved around my dad. I mean, it's fine, but I just never really experienced anything outside of that. So it just feels good to be Callie Coleman for once and not just Bobby Coleman's daughter. -You know what? I feel that. -Yeah. And Taylor hands off to Coleman. And look at him zig-zagging through the snow! Is it me, or is Bobby Coleman making yet another unbelievable play? It's, uh, not perfect. But what are we thinking? That you're a genius! What? The structure is crazy! We can do so much with that. Ooh, ooh, we can throw the circuits in the back. And if we rotate that arm, great launch. It's already, like, perfect. Guys...gold stickers! Yes, Zoe, yeah. Falcons on the 2-yard line. And it's handed to Coleman. Oh! He flips over the top like we've never seen before! Yeah! I don't know what radioactive spider bit Bobby Coleman, but this is the fifth game in a row... Yes! My baby can fly. We got a good thing going or what, huh? * Watch the fam eat, never starve * Coleman, just one hand, and he stops Garner. Yeah! Whoo! He's gonna bust out the dance moves. You can stay up here if you want to, Jim, but I'm going to the field to dance with Bobby Coleman and the Falcons. -Peri, head of PR. -Nice to meet you, Peri. That was quite a game. I have never heard the press room buzzing like this. -Buzzing for me? -Mm-hmm. Hi, can I get a chamomile tea, please? You're Bobby Coleman's wife, right? -Yes. -Girl, okay. It is on the house for the whole season. -Are you serious? -Yeah! Okay, okay! * Gotta elevate * No more looking back 'cause I stay in the game * * On to the next, I don't see no contest * Last bit of business. What do we call it? SpongeBot SpareParts. -That was dope. -I like that. -Yeah? -Let's do it! * No more looking back 'cause I stay in the game * I got big news! Big news! Coach just told me I'm starting next game. Not Anderson, me. It's been 10 years since I've started. Mm! A small knock might've been nice. Hey, it's all happening! It's all happening. And--and this game is the most important so far, so I need you to make sure I'm at my absolute best this Sunday. -Wait, this--this Sunday? Wait, you got somewhere more important to be? Yeah, the robotics regionals. Can't you just scoot away, you know, when you're not doing your thing so you can do our thing, huh? The thing that's got me starting over Anderson Fisher. Maybe. Callie, I-I need you. Your dad needs you. -I need you. Yeah. Of course. I'm--I'm sure I can manage. -That's my girl. -Mm-hmm. Yes! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to First Robotics Regional Competition. You will begin in five minutes. Teams, prepare your robots. CBS Sports. EA Sports-- Get in the game. Sorry. Just doing a little recon. -Yes! - Dellview! You guys are up! - Paws up! - Let's do this! Go! * All I do is win, win, win, no matter what * * Got money on my mind, I can never get enough * There you go. * Everybody hands go up You know what they say about great players. The more personal you are, the more valuable you are. And he's all alone down the sideline. And he leaps in for good measure for the touchdown! And Coleman comes back just in time to make an incredibly difficult play. This is quite the balancing act. Whoo! Stop! Someone just threw up all the way at the other end of the building, and it's just so, so far from here. Worst than bingo night. * All I do is win, win, win, no matter what * And now Coleman, it's like he's frozen in time. Multitasking is important. Trying to figure out exactly which way to go? Also important. Look at that. Focus regained. And now he just heads straight to the sideline. Crisis narrowly averted. Despite defenders coming from every direction, Coleman bobs and weaves, somehow finding a clear path. -Hey. -Were you just in the closet? No. No, no. What's going on? Is something wrong? 'Cause you know you can tell me. I'm good. Mom, I'm fine. I'm just a little stressed with the, um... the robot stuff. It's crazy in there. But I gotta get back in there. See you in there. No, no, no! Can't control it! What should we do? Oh my gosh! Callie, watch out! Oh my god. Callie! What is she doing? * All I do is win, win, win, no matter what * * Got money on my mind, I can never get enough * * And every time I step up in the building * * Everybody hands go up -Yes! -My god! * And they stay there And they stay there * * And they stay there * Put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there * Anderson, how does it feel knowing your teammate's on track to break your single-season rushing record? I mean, gotta be some mixed emotions. Whatever gets the team a win, right? But, uh, I would like to know how he's doing it. Anybody wanna know? Hey, maybe it's a, I don't know, a ripple in time-space continuum. Comedian! No, but seriously, though. How are you doing it, my boy? Come on, Bobby, what's your secret? I'd have to say, honestly, the support of my family. Those two ladies right there in the back? They just started supporting you, huh? Yeah. Huh? How are you guys feeling about Bobby's season so far? Oh, we are just so very proud of him. -Right, Callie. -Yeah. Yeah, I mean, totally. I mean, we're sort of like our own team, you know? We feel like we're a very big part of his success. Like, a very big part. She's not wrong. Uh, I couldn't do it without her. Without them, I mean. He really couldn't. Real cute family moment, right? Let's get back to the football questions. Well actually, given how supportive your daughter has been, don't you think she deserves her own car? Or at the very least, is able to borrow yours so she can hang out with her friends? What do you say, Bobby? I say, you know, we can talk about it at home. Right, Callie? But the people want answers, Coleman! Here we go! Stand by. Five, four, three... So what is it being like in the Coleman household? -I would say busy. -Yeah, busy. -Real busy. -Okay. But, I mean, you know, we've just been hanging out, playing a lot of Madden . I love it. Gotta get that player rating up because, it's--it's way too low. Yeah, we're working on it. Yeah, we're-- she's working on it. Working on it. Does that mean he's working on that new car for you? Oh no, Burleson, you're killing me. My bad, my bad. But you, Bobby, you've been killing it -on the football field. -Thank you, man. Playing like a man 15 years younger. Yeah, I appreciate that. I think every guy wants to know. To be honest, I wanna know. What is the secret? -Ah, no secret. - No secret? No secret. Come on, Callie, say it with me. The people want answers! It ain't that funny! Laugh again. Hey, girl. You have a sec? We are totally stumped over here. Does this circuit look right to you? -Hey, Callie. -Ready for us, superstar? Sorry guys, I gotta run. Good luck! * Like hey, like hey * Everybody in the place okay * We got you feeling like hey, rock the party * * Got you feeling like hey, rock the party * * Are you feeling a way? * Well, okay, okay, okay * Now you're feeling like hey, rock the party * * Got you feeling like hey, rock the party * * Are you feeling a way? * Well, okay, okay, okay * Job, late nights, gotta get it right * Peri, just the woman I've been meaning to see. Question, bobblehead. Do we have a release date for those yet? Peri, look, I'm a real-life bobblehead. Look! * Rock with me in the magic Thanks for the love, G. * Everybody in the place to be * Put your hands in the sky, reaching out to my people * * All around the globe * Tapped in while the beat goes * * Feeling like hey, like hey * Everybody in the place okay * We got you feeling like hey, rock the party * Whew! Would you look at that? * Can you feel, can you feel the wave? * * Keep our hands high, feeling it all right * * Let the beat play, movin' us side to side * * 'Cause this music is a vibe they can't deny * * Just turning up, let it go all night * * So we're being like hey, rock the party * * Can you feel the wave? * Okay * Tell me, can you feel, can you feel the wave? * We're happy you're back. Yeah, we really needed you. What you--no, what you-- Now, what are you lookin' at? -Nothing. -Yeah? -Mm-hmm. All right. Sorry, guys, I... I gotta head out. Hey, Callie! Can't you stay? Oh, well, it's just with my dad. Your dad. Yeah, um, see, we're just kind of counting on you to redesign the arm. I mean, we can't really do anything until you do that, so... Okay, well, look, it's literally been... -It's been insane. -I get it. But we can't just keep waiting on you. I mean, if you need to quit, we understand. No, no no no, I never said anything about quitting. I want to be on the team. And I promise you I will get it done. -Okay. -Cool. I'll see ya. Rise up. Don't mind if I do. All right, man, what's up, huh? 'Cause you creepin' me out. Look. I'ma level with you. I don't get a guy your age, with your history, can just elevate his game like that in one night. I know I'm better than you. Is it that hard to believe? Yeah. Look, I don't know how you're doin' it, but I know it's not normal. What's your secret? Nate! Thanks for coming and helping with the robotics arm. I've been really busy. You know, we're a little behind, so... Yeah. I brought some tacos. I can't wait to see your arm design. Uh, so this is my room. So, okay, um, I haven't made a lot of progress, but I can just show you some of the basic schematics. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got Madden ? And it's signed by Anderson Fisher! You don't--you don't play Madden . Oh, okay, you haven't heard? Girls play video games too, so... -Oh, is that right? -Mm-hmm. Change of plans. I think we should get a warm-up game in before we dive into the schematics. And if I lose--if I lose-- we play some games. Guess we playin' two games, then. Oh, is that right? -Uh-huh. -Okay, gotcha. You know, it's a mix of the agility training meets the mindfulness exercises, all right? Over and over. And, um... Dietary changes. What dietary changes? Um...special high-performance smoothie. -A high-performance smoothie? -Yeah. Listen, I gotta rock. Sensei says I should, you know, meditate every three hours. And, so, let me just get on out of here. You know what? I could really use one of those high-performance smoothies. How 'bout you make one? Right now. Whoo! Okay, um, wait, remind me. In football, more points are better, right? You know, let's go through the tutorial real quick. Like, really teach you how to play. Oh, you a savage, huh? You know I let you win this one, right? -Oh, for real? -I had to. You can't--okay. Whatever. How come you don't play as your dad? He's hot right now. It's like he's having a second coming or something. Well, I only play him for actual games. -What? Um... Um, well, what I mean is when I'm not there with him, like with my family, I, um... I play him in Madden to make it feel like I'm there. Yeah, yeah, like, um... We call it virtual bonding, so, yeah. How about I just grab us some sodas? That seems accurate, yeah. I will be right back. I'm not--I'm not...thirsty. Okay. Ah, okay. Really need your blueberries, right? Need your antioxidants. Then you get your strawberries. Get it all in there. Yep, everything, that's it. Yeah, right there. Banana in. Whole thing. With the peel on. With the peel? A little oatmeal never hurt anybody. Two scoops. Or more. Aah! Yo! Fallen and you can't get up? I just fumbled the spoon. I'm old, G. Yes, yes. The key is, uh, the milk, right? You know? But never from a cow. Only oat or goat-- it won't make you bloat. I gotta say, man, sound like a normal old smoothie to me. I don't like the hair, so let's put a fro on him. Yo, I'm gonna be your age by the time you're finished making this smoothie, man. Yo! Can I help? I'm good. I'm all good. Yeah. Put some blond hair on him. Yo, can I help? No, just keep shooting pool. Don't move at all. The real secret is all about the fertilizer. You gotta fertilize yourself. Nasty. All right, now we'll add some junk to that trunk. I'm coming back there. Why? Why? That's how he should look. That's exactly how he should look. What are you doing? That's my dad! Whoa, relax. You know, I thought it was funny. Well, it's not! I got my butt back! What? Oh, it's a Gen-Z thing. It's kind of like, you know, I figured it out. I got my butt back! What did you do? What else did you change? Look, you know what? I think I'll just head out. I didn't you'd get so upset over a little video game. Wait, Nate, Nate, look. Um... Okay, so you may not know, but the game, it's, um, uh... It's... It's, um... -Well, I... -You know what? I'll just see you at school. That's great. It's the hospital. I gotta take this. But don't move. I made brownies to eat. Hey, what's up? Wanna tell me what happened to me today? It was my friend. I shouldn't have left him alone with the game, all right? All right, look, Anderson was real suspicious of me today. Okay? He could ruin everything for me. You can't be so careless. You know? Especially not when I'm about to beat his rushing record and we're about to make the playoffs. I know. I know. All right. But also, I was thinking... Maybe we should chill on the whole Madden thing. What do you mean the whole Madden thing? What are you talking about? I just think it's too much right now. And with nationals and everything, I... I think I need to focus on robotics. Callie, robotics? I got a shot at the Super Bowl. You know what that means? That means a bigger house. A nice pool. A shed. We can build a whole shed for you to do all the robot building you could ever wanna do. It's great news for all of us. Hey, check it out. Look. Your dad's on TV again! Everybody keeps asking me what my secret is. There's no secret. What's up, big man? That's it! Hard work! My hard work! That's all there is to it! You tell 'em, Bobby Coleman. That's what I told them. That's my secret. Can we--can we at least tell Mom? She almost caught me while I was juggling helping you and trying to win regionals. I'm sure your mama didn't think twice about it, Callie. -You know your mother. - What's the problem? -I'm starting to feel guilty. I mean, look at us. We're lying. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. Hey. Come on, now. I'm having a moment in my life. We all are! And for once, hey, baby girl, for once, I'm finally living up to that thing, huh? So let's not go rock the boat now. No, no, no, Just keep doing what you're doing, and you're doing it great. Everything will be just fine, okay? Okay. Easy for you. I'm the one doing it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, Callie, I'm actually on the field getting the job done. You're just pressing some buttons a little. Just pressing some buttons? A little? Babe! I just hit a million followers! Ha! The Las Vegas Raiders have made the trek east to take on the Atlanta Falcons in a game that is pivotal for each side and just huge for the Falcons' playoff chances. Well, they're going up against one of the teams that people recognize around football as one of the toughest teams in the league. So we'll see how good the Falcons are. And the Falcons get the job done on their home turf at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. They know they have to get this one. Can they do it? Taylor hands off to Coleman, who--whoa! What is he doing? What is circling inside of his head? What is going on? That's a great question, Jim. We're all actually asking that because Coleman is just running around in circles. Stop messing around! This is bizarre. He's just lost. And still running in circles, going absolutely nowhere. Hold on a second. It looks like he's changed course. Now he's headed directly for the sidelines. What a strange way for him to start the game. What is he doing now, Jim? Tony, he's lost his mind. He's just jumping around. Coleman is completely out of it. I don't think jumping around is going to help. He passes the ball. Come on-- Oh! Right in the face! Coach Evans! I think the only one amused there is Anderson Fisher. Exactly. This isn't funny. He's out of-- Right now he's doing the Worm. I mean, there's a ground game, and then there's a ground game. But you don't do the Worm. To be precise, it's on the 46th yard line. He's being ridiculous. Hey, Fish time, baby! Way to go, Dad! I don't know what's happened. This is not the same guy we've seen all season long. I'm ready to call it, partner. That was definitely one of the dumbest things I've seen on a football field. And that will bring an end to the first quarter, which has been downright memorable for all the wrong reasons. Hey, Dad! How's the game going? Callie, what are you doing? What do you mean? You're the one doing everything! I'm pressing some buttons to help out a little, right? Okay, okay, you made your point. We can talk about it when I get home. Now I need you to turn my play around so Anderson don't replace me. Please. Mm, but have you learned your lesson? Coleman! Come on. Coming, Coach! Get my helmet. Lesson learned, all right? Okay, thanks, bye. Okay. Uh oh. Hi. Callie... We've been talking. And with nationals in a week... Screw lead-ins. You promised us a new robot arm. You called it SpongeBot 2.0, and yet we haven't seen anything. Well, I mean, it's just taking a little bit of extra time, that's all. Everything is coming together, though. I'm just working on it at home. Nate knows! Right, Nate? Actually, I don't. I mean, you can show us now, if you want. Um... Okay, well... The truth is... I haven't finished it yet because I haven't started it yet. You haven't started it yet? Callie, we were counting on you. We didn't work on it because you said you would. Without your changes, we will be too far behind and laughed out of nationals. Like, laughed at, not laughed with. I know, it's just, look, everything has been crazy right now with my dad-- Look, look, stop with this dad stuff. We're not mad at him. We're mad at you. And what happened to wanting to be Callie Coleman and not Bobby Coleman's daughter? You might not need these scholarships because your dad is a big, famous football player, but for some of us, that money could actually make a huge difference! I'm gonna need that iPhone case back. And the T-shirt too. I didn't know my amazing craftsmanship would go to waste. Fine. But maybe, if anyone actually knew what they were doing on this team, this wouldn't be a problem! Too smart for this mediocre crew anyways! And then there were the Falcons, right? There is no better story in the NFC than Bobby "Comeback" Coleman. He ain't all that. -- with a record-tying six touchdown game. And now? He's on the verge of breaking the single-season rushing record. Yeah... I did it first. I mean, you just wanna root for this guy, right? Especially when you see him with his daughter. Those two make quite the couple. Oh, it's adorable. But, you know, just been hanging out, playing a whole lot of Madden. Man, I love that they play Madden together. The way Bobby's been playing, it seems he's leveled up in real life. It does seem like that, doesn't it? ...but he might be getting a little nervous out there, if I were him. Bobby Coleman's been toting that rock. It's like Anderson who, right? That's her exact same schedule. Hold up. Those are the exact same plays. That's crazy, no. Thank you. Callie! -We're home! -We brought you some food! Where is she? -I'll check on her. -Okay. All right. Oh, baby girl, we got dinner down-- Callie, what are you doing? Put the controller down now. I finally felt like I belonged somewhere and now all my friends hate me. What are you talking about? This game ruined my life. Callie, we're dominating! You're kidding me? I'm having the best season of my career! And I'm having the worst! Isn't there something wrong with that? Callie, think about what you're doing. No, no, no, no, no, no! No. No. What are you doing? Gotta go to Best Buy, right? They--they--they can recover the data. Geek Squad, don't fail me now. That whole thing? Come on, leave it alone! Don't--Dad, what are you doing? It's over! It's over! -Dad, look, stop! -Hey! You're not gonna get it back. It's gone, it's gone! No, Callie, I'm taking it! Give me the game! Callie, Callie! I wish none of this had ever happened! You guys are insane! What is going on with you two? -Is this about that video game? -No, it's not just the game. What she really means is more of a metaphor, right Callie? No! This game has some sort of weird body controlling thing. Please feel free to expand on that. Mom, whatever I do in the game, it happens in real life. That's the reason Dad's been playing so well! Callie Amber Coleman, is that what you think? It's true. It's true, Keish. I know it does sound insane, but the game has some sort of power over me. Or at least, it used to. -And now I got nothin'! -Excuse me? Your daughter and I are not nothin'. But we'll come back to that. Because what I just heard come out of both of your faces is that whatever Callie does in a video game, Bobby mirrors on the field move for move. Is that correct? And you two aren't messing with me? How could you two keep something like this a secret? Mom, I'm sorry, I wanted to tell you, but Dad said not to-- Wait, wait, wait, you're sorry about that? How 'bout the fact that you just made all of my skills disappear? Gone, poof, just like that! And right before the playoffs are about to start? And by the way, I was about to break the rushing record. That's literally all you care about! Callie... Baby girl... This was a win/win for both of us. And all our dreams were finally coming true. Your dreams! But what about me? I was finally starting to become my own person! Not everything is just about you! You told our daughter to lie to me? -Listen, Keisha... -No. You don't get to talk right now. What happened to us being a unit? I mean, I get it. You're Mr. Bigshot on the field. But in this house? We're partners. And right now...it sure doesn't feel that way. -I mean, Keisha-- -No. Callie! * Yeah, well you the GOAT Hey, first game of the playoffs, baby, let's go! Hey, you ready to bring some of that Bobby Coleman action? You know it! You know it! Coleman! Where's Bobby? -Coleman, there you are. - That sweater is terrible! I know your secret. I know all about what you and your little daughter been up to. Check it out, Joe. When his daughter plays Madden, it makes him good at actual football. Everything she does on the game he does on the field. Yo, no offense, but what? Look, I don't know how you're doing it, but I got proof. I got proof! His daughter recorded her Madden gameplay, and it was exactly the same as his six-touchdown game a few months back. -Hey, I just leveled up! -Scoot over. - Come on, now! - What you doin'? Give the controller back. What's wrong, man? What you doin'? What? No, no. Where is it? No, no, it was right here. I saw it. She recorded it. Look, y'all remember when he had that six-touchdown game. Right? It was the same on Madden , too! Admit it, Bobby! You and that daughter of yours? Y'all made some kind of deal with a real-life game genie. Boom! Busted! Wake up, fam! In, like, one day he went from rickety old man to some kind of superhero overnight? What do you think caused that? Multivitamins? I think not. You know what it was? It was his magical video game. That's right, Bobby. I figured it out. -I got my butt back. -You got your butt back? It's a Gen Z thing. Hey, hey. Why don't we just play football? Right, AF? Just play ball. 'Cause you sound crazy. -I'm not crazy, y'all. - You sound crazy. I'm not crazy. I'm not going insane. It was on the game! Man, shut up! I'm with Bobby. That boy crazy, man. -Let's focus up. -It's on the game. Yeeeaahhh! It's starting, if you wanna watch! I'm good! Taylor, the quarterback. Coleman in the back field. And they'll hand it off to Coleman. Oh! He fumbles right away. But the Falcons do keep possession. Now they throw it to Coleman. And it goes directly through his hands. Bobby! Jim, as I suspected, Bobby Coleman's going out and Anderson Fisher's coming in. You can't blame him. Coleman just doesn't look like himself out there. Yeah, well, technically, Jim, he hasn't looked like himself all season. I mean, he started off on fire. But today we saw him revert back to that fumble-throwing guy that we've seen throughout most of his NFL career. Isn't this the worst? What? Feeling bad for someone you're mad at. Takes all the fun out of it. I mean, no matter how angry I get at that man-- and he can test me-- I never wanna see him struggle. And we both know he's had his struggles. But that's the thing about loving someone. You never stop rooting for them. Thanks to Anderson Fisher, the Falcons were able to eke out the win today to keep their season alive. Man, but how about Bobby Coleman? Looks like his so-called resurgence was just a fluke. Pathetic! I say just retire. Keisha? Look, I apologize-- Not now. I can't find Callie. She left after the game and she hasn't answered her phone for two hours. Has she mentioned any plans? No, she's got that robotics competition thing coming up and she might be at the school, but let's go. Okay. Excuse me? Hi. We're Callie's parents. Oh yeah, we met at your house the other day, right? Wait, he was at our house? When was this? Not now, not now. We're looking for Callie. Uh, we kind of had to kick her off of the team. Wait, why? She loves it so much. Yeah, see, she was supposed to figure out this big element of our robot, but-- no offense to Mr. Coleman-- she was so consumed by your success that she didn't really have much time left for us. And she's super good. I mean, she the whole reason we even made it to the nationals. Yeah, well, now she is the whole reason why we are completely screwed. Uh, sorry for the language. It's just I don't think we're gonna find another Callie before nationals. Lightning definitely doesn't strike twice. -I know where she is. -Where? Babe, I know where she is. Thank you! Thank you! And sorry. Right there! There she is. What in the world is she doing? Callie! Callie! Dad, please stop! I'm trying to fix this! All I need to do is get struck by lightning again. -Baby girl, no! -Baby, this is insane. -You're gonna get hurt! -But it's all my fault! I mean, everything was great until I ruined it. No, you said it--we're a team. You didn't drop the ball. I'm the one who dropped the ball. You've already given me so much. You have! And now you're standing in the rain, trying to get yourself struck by lightning, -all for me again. -But football is your life! No, baby. No! You're my life. Don't you see? It's you. And you're smarter and more talented than I could ever be. You led your team to nationals! Yeah, and then I let them all down! No, no, no, that's no me too, okay? I just got caught up, you know, in all the attention. I didn't think about how it affected you. Then I asked you to lie to your mother. I shouldn't have asked you to lie to anyone. So, I'm sorry, okay? You hear me? I'm sorry. I'm sorry to you, and I'm sorry to you. I guess I thought that being on top of the world would mean that I could give you both the world. But really you just wanted me right here, present. So I'm here, present. I mean, with the playoffs and everything, it's just-- No, hey, come here, come here. Come here. It's just a game. You get it? The playoffs... It's just a game. You mean everything to me. You and your mama. We really need to get out of this rain because we're going to get pneumonia. Please come over. Mom, pneumonia's a little extreme. Worst-case scenario, it's probably just the sniffles. Please, just trust me. I am a medical professional. -Good morning! -Whoa! -Ha, ha, ha. -What's going on? Let's go, let's go. We got work to do. What? Come on, come on. It's 6 o'clock in the morning on a Saturday. Yeah. This isn't about me. Today is not about me. -Come on! -Dad, Dad, stop. We gotta go. Hey, hey! You drivin', Miss Thing. That's right. I'll see you downstairs. Breakfast on the table. Let's rock! The most important game of your career is tomorrow. Are you sure you wanna spend your day here? Yeah, I do. You get this thing done, you guys still have a shot at nationals. I'm gonna stay here, help you as long as it takes to get it done. All right? But I do have one question. What is all of this stuff? And, uh, how does any of it work? * Oh no, got me goin' loco * Make me go berserk-o * Shake it in a circle * Circle * Oh no, got me goin' loco * Gotta put in work, though * Make it work * Lo--lo--lo--loco Lookin' sharp. * Loco What's wrong? Uh, there's a piece missing. A small bronze cylinder about this big here. See? It's supposed to be here as a counterweight for this upper joint. The arm won't work without it. Ah, what about this? Nope. See, this one is too light to provide the torque that we need. I've torqued about enough. Without the counterweight, the balance is off. And you say that it's a bronze cylinder about this big? Come with me. Come on. I don't think I completely understand. You want me to cut off the arm of your Heisman Trophy? Yeah, because this young lady right here, well, she matters way more to me than some piece of metal, right? So just cut that arm right off my Heisman. We got a robot to build. Wow, uh, it seems like I'm missing some significant context here. But we don't have to do that. I can just sell you a piece of bronze. -Oh. -I mean, is that okay? I mean, that way you can have your cake and eat it too, you know? -Way better. - Okay. -Way better. -I'm gonna go get the bronze. I will be back. Don't go anywhere. -Win-win. -Yeah. Um, guys!? SpongeBot SpareParts! Ooh, with a new arm, too. Hey, it's Callie. Um, I owe you an apology. You were relying on me, and I didn't deliver. If you don't want me back, I completely understand. But y'all mean everything to me. Either way, I want you to take this finished SpongeBot 2.0 to nationals and destroy the competition, and also crush, obliterate, and annihilate them. Oh, jeez. -You good? -Yeah, yeah. Um... That was, um... That was supposed to be a way cooler reveal. Wow, hiding in a tree, yeah. That's creepy. Yeah, it's not my best look. Look, I'm sorry for the mean things I said. Yeah, me too, it got pretty brutal. Yeah, and I'm sorry for, um... Well, SpongeBot kind of covered it. I, uh, think these belong to you. What do you guys think? Shall we see what this little guy can do? Yes! Let's go! Zoe, Kayla, you're up! Go long. Launch it! Oh my god, Oliver! So, um... You were supposed to catch it so it doesn't break our windshield! Are we cool? Even though I acted very weird when you came over? -Yeah, we cool. -Okay. And for the record... you being incredibly weird is the reason I like you. Callie! Uh, I'ma head home, all right? You stay and enjoy your friends. And the car is yours for the day. Thank you! Your mom just pulled up to pick me up. And be safe. -Hey! -Hey. I'm Nate. Nathaniel? Nate. You can call me Nathaniel. We didn't really actually get a chance to meet? I just wanted to let you know that it's been a pleasure -being with your daughter. -Ooh, say what? Um, uh, having contact with her--interpersonally, though. Because of robotics? Yeah, because of robotics. Robotics. Look, it's an honor to meet you, Mr. Bobby, Robert... -Mr. Coleman is perfect. -Right, Mr. Coleman. -Mr. Coleman. -Yeah. Well, thank you, Nate. Pleasure to meet you too, young man. And remember, I got my eye on you. -Right. -Right. Right. * Are you ready? Jim, the energy here at Mercedes-Benz is electric. A sold-out crowd is hoping to see their Falcons punch their ticket to the Super Bowl. But they gotta go through the Saints here today. That's right, partner. And all eyes are on Bobby Coleman, who's had the Cinderella season. But he came out last game looking like Sleeping Beauty. Yes, but even after that performance, he's still just 45 yards away from overtaking Anderson Fisher's single-season rushing record. But the big question is, will Coach Evans give him the minutes he needs to do it? -These seats are incredible! -Okay. -You do this every Sunday? -Um... This season's been a little different. Yo, I'll take a dog! Oh, dog, you want a dog? Make that double dog! With kraut. Everybody gets a sign. Callie, you are the exclamation point. Oh, Ms. Coleman, I'm sorry. I should've brought you one too. It's okay, honey. I consider myself a human exclamation point. Okay. And the NFC championship game is underway. And this will go for a touchback. Signs up! Signs up! Come on, Bobby! Coach Evans going with Bobby Coleman. Wow, I can't believe it, but I love it. And Coleman, right off the bat, is hit hard for a loss. Well, the Saints are not gonna make this easy for Bobby Coleman. Get it together, Bobby! They're crushing you out there! -Your mom is a little... -Passionate? -I was gonna say terrifying. -Yeah, that too. And now the Saints head to the end zone on a quick strike. Taylor going deep. And it's caught. Touchdown, Falcons. Taylor with a perfect throw. That's how you gotta score against this defense. Handoff, Coleman. And he fumbles it. And the Saints recover. All of last week's troubles not quite behind him. And touchdown, Saints. And they do the little bowling ball! Saints are feeling comfortable in enemy territory. And oh, Coleman once again coughs it up. That's it. Coach Evans says you're done. I'm going to Anderson Fisher. And Fisher looking like he did last year. Into the end zone for sixth. How do you handle this? It's like my heart is gonna explode! You gotta let it out, man. Come on, scream with me. And folks, the game is essentially coming down to this. One final chance for the Falcons. They're trying to get lined up. But the nerves are here, you can tell. Look at this. 42! Now there's just a lot of confusion. And Taylor is gonna have to take a timeout. It's been a back-and-forth battle between these phenomenal teams. And despite Fisher getting more minutes, Bobby Coleman has managed to get within 10 yards of that rushing record. Well, Comeback Coleman has had an unbelievable season. But Anderson Fisher, he seems to be more reliable right now. 42! Time out! Zeros and ones. -What? -I've got it! So analyzing football plays is a lot like coding in Python. Yeah, yeah, I'm not following. The patterns are finite. So if you gather enough data, you can get a sense of which plays are more or less efficient against others. And based on my predictive analytics, I mean, the defense-- Wait, wait, wait, don't tell us. Go tell them. Who? The players on the field? -Yeah. -Do it. Yeah. Come on, guys, that's insane. What am I gonna do? Hop over the divider? -Yeah. - I would. There's a security guard right over there. All right, we need a distraction. Just tell me the plan and I'm ready to execute it. * Ave * Maria * Gratia plena -His voice! -It's...beautiful. Callie, Callie, look! * Gratia plena -It's actually working. -Yeah. * Maria, gratia plena That's your cue. Go, go, go. Where is she going? I've known him for 10 years and I have never seen him do that. * Dominus tecum * Bendicta tu in mulieribus * Et benedictus * Et benedictus fructus ventris * * Ventris tui Hey, trust me, Dad, I got the play you need to run. -Callie, what are you doing? - I got this. Trust me. Over the past two years, I've developed an analytics algorithm that can determine the most likely outcome of various strategies. Long story short, you do what I tell you, you're going to the Super Bowl. White board! I would listen, Coach. You're not really gonna do that, though, right? Let's hear her out. Coach? White board. Here you go. Huddle up. * Can't stop this power, this flaunt, this pose * * This strut, this look, this style * * Come around me, might get too hot * * You go in, but I go out * Boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss * Dad. Save story time for later! Yes, ma'am. That's it. You guys run it like I laid out, my dad's got a 92% chance of scoring the winning touchdown. Okay. Gentlemen...this might cost me my job, but... this is a smart play. We're gonna go with it. Game! Win on three. One, two, three-- Win! -Hey, you must lock the middle. -You got it, Coach. This works, you're gonna get the rushing record. Yeah, but without Madden-- Dad, Dad, you don't need Madden. You never did. Strap in, folks! Here we go! Tony? And Coleman and Fisher are both on the field at the same time in an unconventional move through the final play to go to the Super Bowl. There is no more tense moment than this. The entire season, the trip to the Super Bowl on the line right here. With both of them on the field at the same time, I'm thinking for something kind of tricky. Oh, it is tricky. It's a direct step to Coleman. Around the right side, he's looking for a gap. Go, go, go! Matthias has broken free. He's coming up to make the tackle. But look at this! Coleman's gonna go across the field with a lateral. He's got Fisher! Wait! On the feet! And Anderson Fisher is in! The Falcons have won it in the most improbable of ways! And Atlanta is heading to the Super Bowl! Bobby Coleman had a chance at the rushing record and chose to get his team to the Super Bowl. That gave me goosebumps right there, Jim. Coleman! Aah! You weren't kidding! You're a great hugger. -It's a heck of a play! -Yeah. You could've beat my rushing record, but you put the team first. Look, don't tell nobody but, uh, you might be my favorite player again. Oh, hey! Anderson. You was right about everything. Or...were you? Uh-uh. Coleman! Coleman, you can't leave me like that! It was the game. It was the game! Yes! Okay, now, that was pretty much the coolest thing I've ever seen. -Yeah? -Yeah. Um, hey, in case you were wondering, now would be, like, the perfect time to kiss me. Yes! Yes, yes, I knew it! Yeah...it was a weird year, but also kind of the best. We ended up getting second place at the robotics nationals. My dad signed a multiyear deal with the Falcons after winning the Super Bowl. What's up, Coach? Not you--other coach. And I landed a pretty sweet internship doing analytics for the Falcons. My parents have never been prouder. That's right, Callie, you talk about those numbers! -This is it! -Thank you! Or louder . Okay... And this year for my birthday... all my wishes actually came true. For once, there were no moving boxes in sight. Just an actual group of friends to call my own in a city that's starting to feel like home. And I think maybe a boyfriend? -Happy birthday, Callie. -Thank you. -Can I get one of those? -Yes. All right, Drake. Why don't you move that arm while you still got one? -Dad... -I'm sorry, Mr. Coleman. -You know we-- -Oh, hey, hey, hey. We got a big surprise outside. Come on, let's go, everybody outside now. Come on! * I can feel the beat in my body * * I can feel the rhythm down to my toes, yeah * -Surprise! No way, no freakin' way! -It's all yours. -Oh my god! -Okay, who wants a ride? -Oh, I got the front! Hey, hey! Have at it! Oh, my goodness. * We ain't going nowhere but the top of the world * * All right, don't stop for fools * Yep, I'd say Atlanta's the perfect place for us. * La, la, la-la, la * La-la, la * La, la, la-la, la, la * La, la, la-la, la * La, la, la, la-la-la * Top of the world * Top of the world * Whoo * I can feel the weight off my shoulders * * I can feel myself start to fly * * The way I feel, oh, I wanna show ya * * The way I see the world tonight * * Making lemonade out of all these lemons * * Taking what we got and we make it okay * * If you ever fall, you can reach out for me * * 'Cause we are not gonna stop * Straight to the top * Top of the world, yeah * We don't stop for fools * Top of the world, all right * We ain't goin' nowhere but the top of the world, all right * * Don't stop for fools * Top of the world, yeah * Top of the world * La, la, la-la, la * La-la, la * La, la, la-la, la, la * La, la, la-la, la * La, la, la, la-la-la * * Top of the world * Top of the world * Oh, oh, oh * Oh, oh, oh * Old school rebel * Hey, hey * Let's go, let's go * Oh, oh, oh * We got a new dance for you * Only for the fly and sexy * Wax on, wax off * Let's get it, let's go * Let's get it, let's go * Oh, let's get it, let's go * Let's get it, let's go * Oh, let's get it, let's go * Let's get it, let's go * Oh, let's get it, let's go * Wax on, wax off * Wax on, wax off * Wax on, wax off
