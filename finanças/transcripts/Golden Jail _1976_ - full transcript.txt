Golden Jail Hong Kong. Hong Kong. The bustle, the parties. Hong Kong. The international drug and organized crime centre in all its ways. In Hong Kong, Mr. Winter feels that his empire is threatened. The women organization threatens to escape from his control... ... if they make contact with Interpol. His network, firmly consolidated, will blow up. War between gangs will be an exemplary massacre, ... systematic, merciless. Feeling that threat approaching, Mr. Winter informs his friends... ... that he's decided to fly to Paris and enter the European erotic net. What do you think? I've already told you. What do you think? Do you think we'll be able to leave together? Of course. You mean it? Yes, of course. My glass is empty. He's feeling watched over, spied on. But, who will be able to transmit a mysterious message to Paris... ... without causing suspicion? Are you Miss Marina? Mr. Winter is waiting for you. Mr. Winter has found the appropriate person: Marina, a young and lovely dancer. OK, I'm coming. - Good night. Take seat, please. - Thank you. So you're leaving, you are tired of all of this. Asia is over. Yes, I'm going back home to Paris. This is too hard. I can't do it any more. My family is waiting there for me. What do you want from me? I would like you to deliver a message to a friend of mine, ... Mr. Brianson. Give it to her. It's splendid! Marina accepts Mr. Winter's present. It's very kind of you, Mr. Winter. It's a marvellous medal. For a pretty girl like you it had to be something different. - Don't exaggerate. - I'm not exaggerating, it's the truth. A medal won't cause any suspicion. Pay attention. It's splendid! - Marina accepts Mr. Winter's present. - It's very kind of you, Mr. Winter. It's a marvellous medal. For a pretty girl like you it had to be something different. - Don't exaggerate. - I'm not exaggerating, it's the truth. A medal won't cause any suspicion. Pay attention. She's fine, isn't she? Very fine. - Did you like it? - Oh, yes. - What about your boyfriend? - No, I ain't got no boyfriend. Don't tell me you're living all alone in Hong Kong. Well, yes, all alone. Well, there's a remedy for that. A woman with your class always finds something special. Good night. Good night, Miss, it's been a pleasure. Miss. Have a fine journey. Li Chan... Sit down there. I've heard you're gonna travel to Paris. I'm gonna entrust to you an important mission. OK, you can count on me, as always. - I'll do whatever you want, boss. - If you agree, I'll tell you the details. Mr. Winter, everything is under control. - Are they ready? - Of course, sir. War has begun. The air of Hong Kong doesn't do me any good. It's time to pack. Listen, reserve two tickets on the first flight to Paris. Brianson. Businessman. Come in. Good morning. My name is Marina Mario. Mr. Slim has hired me for a show in Pigalle. So what? Well, that's why I came here. Aren't you Mr. Brianson? Why do you wanna see Mr. Brianson? Oh, I've already told you. I'm a dancer and I've been hired by Mr. Slim. Mr. Brianson's representative. We're police. Please, take seat. I'll be with you right away. Sit down. I'll introduce myself: Inspector Moroy, and my friend Julien. I don't understand a word. May I see your identity card? Yeah, sure. Here. Your name isn't Marina Mario. That's because Marina Mario is my artistic name. My real name is Marie Lebef. Where do you work? Where have you come from? From Hong Kong. From Hong Kong? And you come back to France for work? Yeah. I'll show you my contract. Look. - Do you dance naked? - Sure. Is this contract just for artistic purposes? - Well, what are you insinuating - Don't get angry. - My friend thinks like the police. - Sure. Who is Mr. Slim? Have you met him? Did he sign that contract? He's Mr. Brianson's representative. I met him in Hong Kong. He saw me dancing at a club, and hired me. - Can you describe him? - Sure. He's tall, blonde and about 35 or 40 years old. - Where does he live? - How can I know that? I just went to see him in his office, our relationship is purely professional. Of course. Did you notice if he drinks a little? Yes, maybe, but just a little bit. That's him. He's changed his name and now he calls himself John Slim. Then, Miss, you've got to come with us to the police station. I don't understand why, my papers are in order. Just to check them out. We're looking for Mr. Brianson. Now that I'm in Paris, I hope we can do business. - That's why I'm here. - Of course. Here, take a look at that. I can send you very important customers. Ask Slim, he knows me. Well, alright. I need a little help. Then, it's a deal. Get a paper and a pencil. - Do you wanna drink something? - No, thanks. Let's establish our arrangement first. Are you Miss Marina? Our first report indicates you came from Hong Kong... ... with a message for a businessman called Slim. - Leave it here. - OK. As I was saying, a man called Slim. No. I didn't bring any message for him. I've just come here to work at his cabaret. Go on, go on. But you've got a medal with a message inside and you gave it to inspector Julien. How do you explain that? It was a jewel that I must show to Mr. Slim. He was interested in those sort of things. That's what Mr. Winter said. Weren't you entrusted with anything else? No. But Mr. Winter is in Paris. Do you know who came with him? No, no. I only know that I can find him at this address. Miss, we'll set you free, but we should arrest you as accomplice. Me? Accomplice? He's a bastard! Julien, accompany the lady to the next room, please. - Right away. - Thanks. Hey, don't you have an ashtray? No. Watch over her discreetly, and go to see that Mr. Winter. - Say you're from the police. - OK. Two policemen want to talk with you. Alright, let them in. Police. Sit down, gentlemen. - What do you want? - Just a few details. Well, tell me. - Chocolate? - No, thanks. Oh, thank you. For my children. Mr. Winter, when did you leave Hong Kong and with whom? That's hard to tell, we were with 200 people on the plane. Alright, this is not a joke, don't you know that? Hello? Mr. Karamalis, please. Karamalis, I'll be waiting for you at my place tonight. Hey, Mr. Winter, Mr. Winter! Mr. Karamalis is waiting for you. He doesn't seem happy. What do you think, Karamalis? - Look at her. - She's fine. - Do you think she's pretty? - Yes, very pretty. This girl is a good deal, Mr Karamalis. - Of course. - She's lovely. - Do you like her very much? - Yeah. You know my taste, Mr. Winter. She's the girl of everybody's dream. - So, do you like her? - Yeah. - Do you want her? - Of course I want her. We have to fix the price. - How much do you want? - There'll be no problem. - I gotta talk to him! - I must tell him first. It's no use. Let me in, let me. - Calm down! - Take your hands off me! You are here. Was everything fine? - I'm glad to see you. - I'm here, but it was awful. - Chocolate? - Keep them for yourself! You can put them where they fit. I'm sick and tired of your presents. You give me jewels, do you? You've used me as if I were your accomplice. If at least you could've asked me to bring you something... But you don't worry about anything that could happen to somebody else. What about me? Don't you care if I go to jail? Don't you care about me? What's gonna happen with my job? Bastard! I despise you, you're a bastard, you make me sick. Bastard! You're a swine. Here, here, here! Hello? I wanna talk to Slim, please. Hi, Slim, Winter speaking. Do you remember the dancer from Hong Kong? That girl, yes. She's betrayed us. Yeah, OK. Take care of her. Yes. Winter has called, he wants to get rid of Marina. You'll go tonight to the cabaret. Find an alibi so the police don't fix their eyes on you. And try not to be noticed. Here, don't go there without dough. You'll be at the bar, to give her cover. At the exit of the cabaret, tomorrow morning, get the girl and bring her here. OK? That's her. What are you doing? No, take your hands off me! Bastard, leave me alone! Leave me alone! You're a beast. You're a bastard swine! Leave me alone! Well? I've already told you. I was in the office. I'm getting tired. Why did you go there? I have already told you I went there to see the businessman. Before leaving Hong Kong, Winter told me to. I will ask you again, why did go to the police and tell them everything? I didn't say anything, I've told you that, they interrogated me. - Where? At first in the businessman's office. Later in the police station. Alright. You've got eight hours to confess. Take care of her. No, no, I don't know anything! Leave me alone! I don't know anything, I don't know anything! No, no, stop, stop! Are you gonna talk? Will you talk? No, no, no! Wait a moment. No, leave me alone! Leave me alone! You'll enjoy it. No, no, no! No, no! My little one. It can be interesting. - Do you think it'll be worth it? - Yes, let's stay, please. Good evening, gentlemen. Do you want to take seat? - So, do we stay? - Yes. A drink, gentlemen? - It's obscene. - An abominable show. - What she's doing is terrible. - She's a whore. - Yes. - Is it that what people like now? It is neither erotic nor artistic. She's just there to be fucked. You can see it. Only in my place can you get something really good. That's true. I need that girl, Winter, I like her. I want her for two months in Hamburg. How much? Think of the number of movies that I buy you. I'm your best customer. How much? Answer me. How much do you want? For you... 10,000 dollars. 10,000 dollars. Well, alright. - And what about my movies? - I got what you need. - Are they fine? - Tremendous. - But, for sure? - Don't you trust me? All you gotta do is ask for what you want. Chan, get the projector ready. I wanna see Claudine's one. Of course, your desires are orders. Chan, project the Claudine movie. The authentic Parisian, winner of elegance. And Charles D'Ourut. An authentic peasant. Strong, vigorous. His grandfather was Tartar?n de Tarasc?n. - He was Maria Luisa's son. - Hello. She doesn't understand a thing. - It's an honour. - Come on, let's go. - Please. - Alright. I got a... ... motorbike. Come on, let's go upstairs. Yes, yes, let's go upstairs. Come on, come on. Come on, come on, get undressed. Hurry up. - Come on! - And my wool T-Shirt? Hey, what are you doing? They are waiting for you. Come on, man, come on. Do you want me to undress you? Do you want me to undress you? We don't have much time. Here it is. The ultimate man. The ultimate man. What is she saying? I don't understand a word. They say that we must hurry up, they have very little time. What should I do with this? Where should I put it? Oh, yes, first of all the feet. - Your trousers, take them off. - Yes, yes. Come on. - What are you doing? - I'm coming, I'm coming. Come on, come on! Come on! Take that off. - You can't make love with that on. - I'm ashamed. If you don't take that off, I'll break our arrangement. OK, but you're gonna be disappointed, I've warned you. Too much weight on my stomach. Well, I hope you're satisfied. It's incredible how the French say goodbye. In the French style. Oh, but... We still got time. - But very little. - It isn't finished yet. There are only three minutes left. It's very little. Three minutes for making love like you do, it's enough time. Well, do you wanna repeat? Well, here I go. - Do we start over? OK. - Are you ready? I'm your slave, my boy. Give the order and I'll start again. Faster, faster! Faster? Well, OK. The race of the century starts. - Faster? - Faster, faster! I'm gonna lose my memory. Come. Don't be afraid. This is not the same. Don't be afraid. Easy, easy. No! That's it my little one. Easy. I like you, don't you know it? I like you. Quiet, quiet, quiet. Quiet, quiet, be quiet. We'll be happy, you'll see. I like you, my little one, I like you. Yeah, don't you see it? Be quiet. Easy, that's it, my little one. It's Claudine. Let her in. - Good morning, boss, what's so urgent? - Wait a moment. And now, tell me all about it. Cheer up, I got a job for you. A good job. - You're going to Hamburgo. - Oh, no! What does "no" mean? I've said no! Let's see, you made me come back to Paris. I became reconciled with my family. I find an understanding boyfriend, and now you ask me to leave? Not at all! There's no use screaming. You will leave. If not, no more paradises. I'll be back, reflect a little. I'm listening. So? You have no sense of shame, how do you dare to tell me you're gonna kill me... ... after all the things I've done for you? Remember Hong Kong many years ago. I worked as a whore for you. Yes, you were an abominable man, you had no scruples. You've been lucky, you made the grade, you've become somebody. But now all of that is over. Everything is over, don't you hear me? You won't use anybody again. I'm gonna kill you. You're dumb! Take her to Slim's, she can reflect there. - Have you come alone? - No, Bob's waiting for me in the car. I heard a bang and I came up as soon as possible. Here. Bastard! You'll pay for this. Calm her down. - Take care of her. - OK. You'd better stay calm, otherwise you're gonna have a rough time. Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! I wanna get out, I wanna get out! Have you finished making all that noise? You're not bad. I like you. I'd like to live with you. - Me too. - We can escape together. Why not? I'll see what I can do, OK? Wait for me here. - I'll be back. - I'll be waiting for you. He's a bastard, he's pulled my leg! Here! You can sleep a little. I was in Hong Kong, things were rather fine. Then I met Mr. Winter. He invited me to all of his parties. He even paid for my plane ticket to come to Paris. He made me come to Paris to work as a whore. To go to bed with the clients. So, I left it all behind. Yeah, he's a real bastard. And what about you? He wanted me to be a whore for him and I didn't want to. I bring you company. Look at them! You do look like the three graces. Hey, feeding time. Come on, at my feet. Hey, you too. Hurry up. I guess you're gonna leave me again. You're wrong, I take you with me. Come on, get dressed. I can't believe it. You've gone too far with this joke. Come on, get out! - Get undressed. - No. Get undressed! Go on. Go on! - Come on. - No. - Come here. Come. - No. Quiet. - No! - Be quiet! - No! - Yes! Leave me alone! No! No! Slim, Bob is escaping with the girl! You, that way! Surround the house! Get close, carefully. Go and see if there's a way to get out of here. OK. Go to the garage. - Take the car and drive it to the road. - I'll entertain them. There's no way, there are two policemen at the door. Look for Roger. Surrender! Damn it! That's it, one less. You'll be an acrobat. Get yourself down and take the car. When you'll be ready, sound the horn and we'll try to get out. Come on, let's go! The house is surrounded. Any attempt to resist will be useless. Mr Winter, we come to arrest you. We've got rid of your gang. Put on your coat and come with us. Well, this joke has lasted too long. Turn around. And put your hands up. We're gonna make a good clean up.
