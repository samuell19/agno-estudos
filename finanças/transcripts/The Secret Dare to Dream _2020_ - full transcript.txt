This is the formation zone for tropical storm Hazel. Now, we've got two models. The American model has Hazel turning north, over Mobile and the Florida Panhandle and into Georgia. The European model has her slowing down, heading northwest, gaining strength and becoming a potential hurricane. This could become a major storm and hit land again anywhere from Gulfport to New Orleans. Hazel is moving at approximately ten miles per hour and should make landfall late tonight or early tomorrow morning. As Hazel makes landfall, she's gonna become a tropical storm once again and bring plenty of rain and high winds to wherever she hits. Now, folks, I feel that Hazel is most likely to head towards our friends in Louisiana. Gorgeous. What's in there? - In that? - Yeah. - Nothing. - Define nothing. Soft shells. - I thought the molt was over. - It was. And then it wasn't. But those are for Fryman's. What, so they can be drowned in garlic and black pepper? You can't even taste them! They offered 55 a dozen. I'll give you 60. Tucker gonna be okay with that? Are you kidding? He'll be thrilled. Soft-shells this late? If anyone asks, you didn't get those from me. Get what? - Careful out there this weekend. - Thanks. Thank you. Seventeen? Seventeen right here. Hi, this is Miranda Wells again. I got an overdraft fee of $80 on the third. But if the check had gone through like it was supposed to, everything would've been fine. So, that fee needs to be removed, refunded, rescinded or whatever. Please call back me today, if possible. Thank you. - Miranda, it's 12:13. - So? So you told me to remind you about a dentist appointment at noon. I forgot. - Hey! - Hey. Up five percent from last year. - Yeah? - Yeah. People are spending again, thank God. - Where are you off to? - Uh, a dentist appointment. Oh, listen, um, - about dinner. - Oh, I know. With the storm. - It's okay. - Yeah. The weather guy says it's gonna miss us, but... - You can never be too careful. - So you think I should? What? Board up? Absolutely. Look, no matter how bad things are, - they can always get worse. - Oh. And here I actually got us in to Shaya. Oh, babe. It's a school night. Thank you. We're fine. Oh! And, um... I bought soft-shells from Sang, who was going to sell them to Fryman's, which I said was bogus, because their chef sucks, which is why I paid 60 a dozen. Soft shells this late in the season? - Right? - That's my girl. Bye. - Thank you. - Thank you. Hi. Sorry. Can I help you? Well, I hope so. I made a reservation on Hotel Tonight. I've got a cousin in Nashville. Oh, is that so? Is this your first time staying with us? Uh, first time in New Orleans. What are you studying? How to get out from behind this desk. Well, anything is possible if you really want it. Yeah, I guess. Any chance you have a room with a view? No, sorry. All of the rooms overlooking the Quarter are fully booked. No problem. I'll take whatever I can get. Room 1 checked out early, on account of the storm. Okay, that's so weird. Room 1 has a view all the way to the river. Must be my lucky day. It's not often I get a grown up in here with a cavity this bad. What do you do, gargle with sugar? Uh... - Saltwater taffy. - Yep, that would do it. Devon says I need a root canal. Well, I think he just misses your company. Mm, how about a week from Monday at 9:00? Donna, you're not helping. Don't you have anything, like... next June? Who's your provider again? I opted out. Um, why? How much is it out of pocket? That's 1,700 for a front, 2,300 for a back. - Is it a front or a back? - Uh, back. Well, I'm sure Tucker wouldn't mind plunking down that platinum card of his. That may be so, but things are... complicated enough what with him being my boss and all. Look, just stay safe tonight. Okay? I hear Hazel's gonna turn. I bet she hangs a left and pounds us straight on. Oh! Nice cast! I, uh... I'm looking for Miranda Wells. You from the bank? Can't say that I am. No. She's at work right now. You can leave it with me. I'm her son. I kinda figured that. Well, the thing is... I'm afraid this comes with a little bit of an explanation. Any idea what time she'll be home? Usually around four. That's a cool thing you've got there. My dad made it for me, 'cause I wasn't getting my line to where the big ones are hiding. He was an inventor. Sort of. Pretty good one, I bet. Well, my mom says he never sold much, but that's 'cause it wasn't his real job. But he sure solved your casting problem, didn't he? Fish don't seem too impressed. - No school today? - I have a cold, but my mom gave me purple Dimetapp, so it's okay. Well, you chose a beautiful day to stay home. Yeah. The storm's not supposed to hit us until tonight. I checked. A couple times. Thanks for the help. Oh, and when you see her, don't tell her we spoke. I'm not supposed to talk to strangers. Your secret's safe with me. There is a chance that Hazel will become a hurricane before it makes landfall somewhere between Pensacola and Morgan City, Louisiana. Even if Hazel never develops into a hurricane, she will be bringing high winds and tons of rain - to the Gulf Coast. - Great. Hurricane warnings are off the... Hi. - Miranda, it's Bobby. - I know. I have Caller ID, and I can see your face, sort of. Well, are you listening to the news? About the storm? No. What? They're only gonna get worse with climate change. I blame cows. - How is your roof? - My roof? The leaks. Did you get 'em fixed? Bobby, I can't afford a root canal, let alone a new roof. You need to sell that damn place and move to higher ground. - So you've said. - Oh, did I? Ever since he died. And it's as true today as it was then. It is not safe. Look, Bobby, um, I gotta run. - I'll call you later? - Well, you never do. You're always so busy. It's busy with the kids. Love you. Hey, gang. How was the day? Awful. Terrible. Bessie, honey, what's wrong? She told some kid she has a pony. They called her a liar, which she is. I said I wanted a pony. Since when? Since always! I told you not to let her watch Black Stallion. You didn't eat your lunch? Nobody brown bags anymore. Why can't I just buy food at school? You can every once in a while, but it adds up. - We've been over this. - So stupid. Okay. Talk to me. What's going on? Hmm? Kit Riley's having a party the same night as me. They're gonna have freaking food trucks. Wow. I don't even want a birthday. I'm never gonna get what I want anyway, so what's the point? Okay. We can't afford a computer right now, but it might be something for Christmas. Right. We'll be lucky to have a tree. You're not supposed to be on the phone while... I wasn't gonna answer it, I just wanna see who it was. I'm expecting a call from the bank. It says Carol. - That's the bank. - Oh, my God. You're on a first name basis with the bank? - Stop being so dramatic. - This is why I don't want - a party, we can't afford it! - Ask if I can call her back. Please? Oh, my God, Mom! You're, like, the worst driver in the whole world. That's because no one else in the entire world has you as a passenger. I am so sorry. It was totally my fault. Are you okay? Are your kids okay? Other than needing an attitude adjustment, they're fine. Well, looks like you got the brunt of it. There goes my deductible. Hey, hey. Don't waste your insurance on this. If you just have a little duct tape and spray foam, I can fix this. I can't ask you to do that. You didn't. I offered. My dad was a mechanic. Hey. Whatever you want. Totally up to you. Well... I mean, we're just up the road. I'll follow you. Thanks. I got it. I got it. - He's not gonna sue us, is he? - Nope. Why is he taking our bumper? Because he's offered to come over to fix it. You're letting him follow us home? Bessie, don't forget your backpack. Okay, Mommy. You know, I realize I never got a chance to introduce myself. - Bray Johnson. - Miranda Wells. - Miranda, nice to meet you. - Yeah. No, not really, but I appreciate the gesture. This is Missy and Bessie. - Hi, guys. - What's the "V" stand for? The "V"? Oh, uh, Vanderbilt. I teach engineering up there. Cool. So, you've got your hands full, huh? Oh, you have no idea. And that's Greg. - Hi, honey. - Hey, Greg. Hey. Uh, Mom? What happened to the bumper? Karma. But Mr. Johnson here says he can fix it. Yeah, you wouldn't happen to have a few screwdrivers and some wrenches in your tool shed, would you? - Of course. - And how about some spray foam? You know, the kind you use to fill a hole or stop a leak? Tiger Foam or Great Stuff? Either will do. Tiger what or Great what? Shop talk. Do you want a beer or a water or a juice box? Nah, this'll just take a second. Okay, well, I'll leave my door open. If you need anything, just holler. Hey, Mom. Check it out. There. See? The last honest man. Now, can you turn on the Weather Channel and set the table? ...Pensacola and Morgan City, Louisiana. So, hurricane warnings are up as Hazel becomes a Category 1 hurricane later tonight or early tomorrow morning, coming onshore somewhere there between Mobile, New Orleans, and Pensacola... Bessie? Let's not color on the table. Okay? And can you please take out the garbage? Okay, Mommy. What's for dinner? Wait. Let me guess. Red beans and rice or microwaved chicken nuggets and a salad. What would you prefer? Lobster tails? Wouldn't you? - I want pizza. - Not tonight, honey. Missy? Come here. Greg is in geek heaven. What do you expect? The poor kid is surrounded by girls. How much are you paying this guy anyway? Nothing. You gotta admit. You coming out here looking for her, then she runs into you? That's pretty weird. - Is it? - Yeah. Because, you know, what are the odds? Or maybe she's just a lousy driver. Uh-oh. Here comes Hazel. Hey, how's it going? Well, it's good, if you let this dry. It'll outlast the apocalypse. Okay, why don't you come inside, wash your hands? Much obliged. Greg, come on! I don't want you missing anymore school. Uh, you'll have to excuse the mess. I wasn't expecting company as you can probably tell. The paper towels and dish soap are right there. And the beer in the fridge has your name on it. - Oh, thank you. - Mom, Bray's a professor. I heard. Uh, what brings you down here? Well, it's, uh... kind of a long story, actually. Oh. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. No, no, I don't mean it like that. - Mom! - What? You put the chicken in the microwave still in the bag, and now it's all melted. Yes, I sure did. I guess it is red beans tonight. - Pizza! - Yeah! Guys, that's not gonna happen. Poor people can't afford pizza. We're not poor. We're broke. There's a difference. You were saying? One second. Guys? Nice, huh? It's our little version of Singin' in the Rain. With pots. Wind scares me. Well, nature can be very powerful, - but so are you. - Me? No way. Oh, yes, you are. But we have to be careful... because we get what we expect. - Mommy? Is that true? - What, honey? What do you call this? A crab riding a bike? What else? A magnet. Which attracts things with a force that you cannot see, but is definitely real. Your thoughts work the same way. The more you think about something, the more you draw it to you. Okay. So, this is me thinking about pizza. Are you really being serious right now? I like when the cheese is all melted and gooey. Mm. And what about you? - Pepperoni and sausage. - Oh. And stuffed crust. That's what makes it. Okay. I've got a medium cheese and medium pepperoni with stuffed crust for Miranda Wells. Did you do this? Don't look at me. You got the right name, but we did not order those. A guy named Tucker called it in. He even left a tip 'cause of the storm. That was so nice. Thank you. - Stay dry. - You too. Thanks. Okay, girls. - Wash your hands. - Okay, Mom. We got pizza! How cool is that? Well, um, I think I should be going. Oh, yeah. No. Of course. Sorry. Thank you. Mom? You smashed his truck. Ask him to stay. Tucker is hardcore buying my love right now and it is so working. His family owns a restaurant on the water. Middendorf's. And I run it. - And him too, I guess. - Ah. She doesn't like to call him a boyfriend because he's 43. Eat your pizza. He sounds like a kind man who recognizes a good person. Are you, like, a Buddhist or something? Missy, what kind of question is that? I don't know. You just seem different. Unlike Mom. Always stressed. - I'm not always stressed. - You so are! Bessie, will you back me up here? Am I always stressed? - Yes. - Traitor. You're exhausted the minute you wake up. Okay. All right. I see how it goes. Everybody gang up on Mom, who works all day and has friends like Tucker. And if it wasn't for her, you guys would all be eating microwaved plastic. - Yeah. What he said. Cheers. - Cheers. You guys are funny. Okay. Homework time. - Dishes in the sink. - I should be going. And, no. I'm not a Buddhist. I just... I'm open to the possibility that whatever happens, even the bad stuff, can lead to better things. Not in this house. Oh! Leave it to a hurricane to ruin a perfectly good evening. You're not driving back to Nashville tonight, are you? No. Not tonight. No. I got a place downtown. But, uh, listen. About today. I just wanna say that everything was... I don't know, really unexpected. Yeah. I never thought I'd say this, but it was a pleasure running into you. You have quite a family. Thanks. They're good kids. I meant to say something earlier, but the timing just... - Mom! Spider! - I wanna see! And, uh, back to my life. Mom, here. Please. - Good night. - Good night. This is a triple-threat storm as it heads in. And it looks like it's gonna make landfall probably late tonight or early tomorrow morning. As you can see, the satellite shows it has a very circular presentation, indicative of a healthy storm. The good news is, as Hazel makes landfall, she should become a tropical storm once again, with sustained winds of 50 to 70 miles an hour, and could miss Louisiana altogether. Yeah, right. ...expect to see when the storm actually hits? This storm will have a large amount of rain. But it will be the wind that will cause the most damage. Historically, wind causes the most damage in this type of storm, toppling trees and downing powerlines... Oh, my God. We're just gonna go into the bathroom, okay? Hurry up. Why don't you guys hop in the tub? It's safe. Why are we getting in the bathtub? 'Cause it's kind of... Remember when Daddy would take us camping and we all huddled together like an adventure? Hey, guys. Watch your feet. Watch your feet. Mom, are you okay? Trying to be. What are we gonna do? If the cereal is dry, grab a bowl and eat something before the milk goes bad. But why does this always happen to us? We're unlucky, I guess. Come on. Let's get you some Cheerios. One, two, three! Good girl. Huh. Are you all okay? I swear. My whole life is like that gut feeling that something really bad is going to happen, and then... it does. Coffee? Thanks. What are you doing here? Well, I couldn't very well leave without knowing you all were all right. Do you have homeowner's insurance? You mean the only one I could afford, with the $5,000 deductible? Story of my life. You know, things don't have to be a series of unfortunate events. Well, it sure as hell feels that way. I know, but... I've found that when I think about what I want instead of what I don't want my life is just so much better. You're one of those people who wakes up happy, aren't you? - Let me help. - How? With more magic foam? I just renovated this nice little Tennessee farmhouse. This won't be a problem. It'll just take time and... And money. Both of which I... I don't have. Not as much as you think. Yeah. Look, with the price of lumber being what it is, we might have to improvise a little. But the main goal is to get you back into a dry house. Yeah? Yeah, that would be a good start. - Let's say $500. - Five hundred? Materials. A roof costs, like, 10,000. Like I said, we might have to improvise a little. But I've got all the tools in the truck and I don't have to be back at class for a week. Why are you helping me? Because I can. Okay. You're hired. But only 'cause you brought me coffee. Thank you. Oh, honey. No, no, no. - Don't throw those away. - They're wet. Yeah, but they'll dry. And these are the most important things in the house. This one's my favorite. Hmm, mine too. Missy's right. I said I had a pony when I didn't. Okay. Well... this is a pony, and you have this, right? Mom? What are we gonna do about my party? It's in five days. - We'll figure it out. - How? Look at this place. I think we should cancel. No. No. No. I know you think that parents have all the answers, but we don't. Not by the longest shot, but you know what? You only turn 16 once. And we're gonna have a party. Where'd you get the coffee? So, it looks like these two rafters are split. Otherwise, it's a clean hole. Meaning what, exactly? - Hey, Bray. - Hey, guys. So, to re-skin this section, I don't know. It'll be about 150. And then the two-by-ten's, a roll of tar paper, some nails, you're still less than 200. And sheet-rocking the ceiling and re-insulating. Maybe another 200? What's he doing here? - He's fixing the roof. - How? We're broke, remember? I don't know. Magnets. Oh, look! Nana's here. Oh. Oh! Oh, my Lord! Is everybody okay? - Anybody get hurt? - We slept in a bathtub! You slept in the bathtub? - There's a hole in the roof. - Oh, that is so scary. I have been trying to call you all night. Well, cell towers must have been down. Mom was so cool. She didn't panic or nothing. She didn't panic or "anything." Look at this mess. What did I tell you about that house? And now... Who is that? Oh, that's Bray. He's gonna fix the roof. Just like he fixed Mom's bumper. He had pizza with us. - What pizza? - Stuffed crust. Yes. Bray is going to try to fix the roof. - Bray? - Is he licensed? He's from Tennessee. Can you say hello to my mother-in-law, Bobby? - Bobby, Bray. - Bobby, Bray. - Nice to meet you. - Uh-huh. And you. Mom smashed into him with the van. I didn't smash into him. I tapped his bumper. And yours fell off. What's the verdict? I'm gonna swing by the lumber yard, pick up some materials. Also see if I can snag a blower or two and get those floors dry. Well, we'll be here. Oh, no, you won't. These children can't stay here. Why not? Their bedrooms are dry. Honey, I have two words for you, black mold. And Greg is sick already as it is. - Well, what about school? - The power's out, and the radio said they're closed today and tomorrow. Yes! Why not spend a few nights with me and just maybe come up with a plan? Sure. You're right. Why don't you guys go pack up some clothes? We're gonna go to Nana's. Two minutes, you have. Don't pack everything. Fun! - Thank you. - Thank you, honey. Um, do you think we could stop by the restaurant on the way out? I wanna check on Tuck. Who is this complete stranger that you are trusting your home with? Not everyone is a serial killer, Bobby. I mean, he's a college professor for goodness sake. Well, you can't be too careful these days. The only thing of value in that house are the kids, and they're coming with us. So, I'm just gonna believe that he's not gonna screw us and he's gonna do the best job he can. Have you met people lately? So, we'll get out of your hair then. She seems worried about you. Well, we're all used to playing defense around here. But I appreciate what you're trying to do. - What am I trying to do? - Give us hope. But I am trying to raise my kids to be realistic. Their father was a dreamer, and apparently that's genetic, especially with Greg. And I just want to keep their feet firmly planted on the ground. - Roger that. - And your next question is about my husband, but you're too polite to ask. He died just over five years ago. I'm sorry, truly. Me too. He's really missing out. We should exchange our numbers, right? Yes, of course. Oh, Tuck. Nice, huh? It's a good thing we boarded it up. But we're all right. - How is everyone? - Uh, fine. We had some damage to our roof, but I have someone working on it. And we're gonna head to Bobby's for a few days. You all could have stayed with me. Do you wanna tell her that? Hell no. She'd never forgive me. And I'm trying to stay on her good side. Who's doing your roof? Oh, just a guy. You don't know him. - Okay. - So, I'm gonna get them settled, and I'll borrow her car, and I'll come back and help you. No. You take care of business. - I'll call you later. - Really? - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Okay. - See you, Bob! Has Tucker lost weight? He looks good. Uh, nope. I don't think so. Any developments I should know about? - Why rock the boat? - Cause he's a good man. I know that's a strange thing for a mother-in-law to say, but I also know that, you know, it can be hard to move on. I'm a widow, too, remember? I just don't see the point in forcing something that neither one of us needs or wants. Sign here. Thank you. - Hi. Hello. - Hi, I'm Bray Johnson. Is that his? Is that that guy's? - Excuse me. Is that yours? - Oh, my God. - Hey, I'm Matt Wells. - Bray Johnson. How you doing? Can I get you a drink or something? Okay, I'm just saying, if I could put pressure at six, six point zero, six three... Gentlemen, this is Matt, the inventor I was talking about. Hey, I've been meaning to call you. How'd it go? - Did you survive big bad Hazel? - Uh, yes and no. I might have to stick around a few more days. Do you mind? Not at all. So, what happened? Huh, I'm not quite sure. I think the universe is trying to tell me something. What did she say when you gave it to her? Well, that's the thing. I, uh... I haven't told her yet. Well, why the hell not? That is what I am trying to figure out. Where are all the kids? Well, we're mostly grown-ups here who've retired. So, where are they? They're just sitting in their houses, watching Wheel of Fortune. It may not look it, but this is a very active community. We got golf and swimming and yoga and... We just like to keep things nice and neat and safe and... Oh, my gosh! We got a pond and a gazebo. What's a gazebo do? Just looks pretty. It's where old people sit and complain about their knees - and stuff. - Missy. - What? You said it. - Let's just go in. That is a big hole! Sorry, what? They were damn lucky. You the roof guy? Today I am. Name's Bray. Tuck Middendorf. I own the place on the water. Miranda wanted me to check in. Uh, you're the one who sent the pizza. - Yeah. How did you... - You scored a bunch of points there, my friend. Oh, yeah? How do you know Miranda? Oh, well, I don't, really. Why are you fixing her roof? That's a very good question. Hey, could you, uh, grab me that parachute bag there? Yeah. No, that one, yeah. You can throw it on up here. There you go. - Do you want a hand? - Yeah. Thanks. Heck of a view up here. Yeah, that's why guys do roofs. Oh, yeah, this whole section's gonna have to be replaced. Yeah, I'm gonna re-sheet and re-paper tomorrow. Forecast says there's no rain coming, so it's all good. - But you're not licensed. - No, no. I'm just lending a hand. Well, I wish Miranda had checked with me. I would have paid to hire a real roofer. No offense. None taken. She's stubborn that way. How long have you two been together? Oh, a few years. She came to work for me about a year after her husband died. Good guy too, from what I hear. That must have been really painful. Widowed. Three kids. I think it's made her more cautious. I'm the same way. Why I haven't pushed things farther. You know? Well, things can change if you want them to. I just want her to be happy. Can't say I blame you. - What I want... - Nice meeting you, Bray. Oh, yeah. You too, Tucker. Give me a shout if this gets to be too much. Will do. Oh. Why do people like puzzles? They don't. They just need something to do when they're bored. Oh! You make this sound like prison. Look at all these pieces. - This is gonna take us a week. - Forever. Now, look. I know you love that house. - But I think we... - Can we not do this right now? I was in real estate for 40 years. That place could sell in a day. Or it could take a year and a half. You don't have that kind of time. It's too much for me to think about right now. Well, that's all I'm asking is, you know, that you think about it. I mean, y'all on top of each other. Those girls need another bedroom. You could get your money out and then some. Not with a hole in the roof. Oh, honey, you and I both know that that house is a tear-down. - Hi. - Hey! Hey. I thought you might like a status update. Only if it's good news. Well, I ran out of daylight, but once the power comes back on I should be done the day after tomorrow. - That's fantastic. - I got rid of that limb, I did a little triage on the hole. The floors seem fine, but I'll still run the blower - all night just to make sure. - I don't care about that just as long as we're dry. All right. Well, I'll check back in tomorrow. Wait, Bray. Where are you? What are you doing right now? I'm sitting on your roof, taking in this gorgeous sunset. You? Stressing. Is it about the money? No. It's everything. I... My job, kids, Tucker. I think I might actually have to sell the house. Ooh, that's a big one. No kidding. I just know somebody's going to scoop it up and tear it down. And it just breaks my heart. Look. When the time is right, you'll know what to do. Is that another one of your life lessons? I went through a divorce ten years ago. It really knocked me on my ass. Were there kids? No, no. We wanted to save up a little money before starting a family and it turns out she started one with somebody else. Oh, my God. That... You must have been... Devastated. Yeah. And then I got angry and started blaming everything on everybody else. That doesn't sound like you. Not anymore. That was before. Before? Before another kind of wake-up call. Well... I didn't mean to pry. No, no, no, no, you didn't. It's just that sometimes the best thing to do is... wait till everything becomes clear. Well, that's great news about the house, Professor. Thank you. You're welcome. And have a good evening. - Good night. - Good night. - Good morning, Mr. Johnson. - Good morning, Sloane. I heard you extended your stay. Yeah, I'm just trying to make myself useful to a friend up in Madisonville. Which reminds me, I'm expecting a pretty important package in the next few days. Could you keep your eyes open for it? - Important package. You got it. - Thanks. Keep holding it over like that, 'cause you won't spill anything. Oh! Bobby. What are you doing here? We're helping Mommy. Northshore Food Bank put out a call, and Miranda thought you might be able to help. There are a lot of people on this side of the lake without power. I didn't think you'd mind - putting all this to good use. - Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course. But I could have asked Manny or Charmaine to help. - You didn't have to come in. - Oh, well, it is a workday. Well, maybe she just missed you. - You ever think of that? - You did? What? Oh, uh, nothing. So, after we drop this off, we're gonna skedaddle. I'll call you later. You know, I thought I might show Miranda that new housing development out by me. You know, 'cause she's thinking about selling her place. - You are? - No. I checked Zillow this morning. Lots of listings. But after this storm, yours is gonna stand out. I'm just saying is all. If we move, how will Santa know where to find us? Oh, honey. When you move, Mommy will fill out a change of address card. And the post office will send that straight to the North Pole. What's wrong with our house? Oh, everything, sweetheart. Bobby? I gotta go. Payroll doesn't stop just 'cause the power's out. - I'll call you later. - Okay. Thank you. Let's go easy on that pepper. That will give you the sneezes. Whoa. Ladies first. And the gentleman. Uh, Nana? Do you have any Cinnamon Toast Crunch? Now, that is protein. That is good for muscles. We usually just have cereal. Fresh out of cereal. I'm sorry, honey. This bread tastes gross. Well, that's because it's gluten-free. And when you get to be my age, you'll thank me. What's gluten? It's... That's a thing in food. Mm! "Hi, gang. The power's back on at the house, and the roof is fixed." - Yes. - Yes. Oh, no, already? Whoa, cool! A skylight. It's actually kinda legit. - Whoa! Pretty cool! - How'd you get that up there? A new ceiling. Pretty impressive. What exactly is that thing on the roof? Um, weather-proof Band-Aid. - Where'd it come from? - It just appeared. - Like the pizza? - No. No, no. That was because of Tucker, and this is because Bray worked really, really hard to find something that'd fit. It was probably floating around in the bayou waiting to be useful. And then it found me. Or it was just a coincidence. Um, "coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous." Who said that? Einstein. E equals MC squared guy? He also said that every person should ask themselves, "Is this a friendly universe?" Why? Well, because your answer determines your life. Are you sure you're not from California? No, ma'am. So, you're saying the magnet in your head connected you to that piece of fiberglass... Okay, gang. That's enough questions. This man has a life. Say goodbye to Bray. - Bye. Thank you for the roof. - Bye, Bray. Um, let me get my checkbook. Okay. - Let's go to my room. - Okay, baby. Could I ask you a question? - Shoot. - What happened to the envelope? I haven't given it to her yet. Why not? Well, I put it in the mailbox after the pizza, but it flew away. So, I had to get a new one. What's in it? Grown-up stuff. But definitely something good. Here you go. Five hundred very grateful dollars. Just do me a favor and don't cash it until next week. Understood. So, you're off to Nashville? Yeah. I pretty much got my hands full until winter break. I still don't understand why you helped us. I think you and I collided for a reason. And who's to say? Maybe we helped each other. Miranda? Honey? It's Tuck. Oh! Will you tell him I'll call him back? He says it's urgent. Excuse me. Hi. Um, can I call you back in, like, two minutes? Hold on. Do you and the kids want to come - to the opening tonight? - Okay. See if Bobby wants to come too. Sure. Let me check. Tucker wants to take us all out for the re-opening. Um, and he wants to know if you wanna come. I wouldn't miss it. - Great. We'll see you at seven. - All right. Great. - See you tonight. - Okay. Bye. So, you were saying? Something about us colliding for a reason? Yeah. Well, maybe it was just a chance for me to meet a really cool woman. You're doing a hell of a job raising three kids on your own. Thank you. Although, I think I got the better end of the deal. Oh, hey, listen, I still have the chainsaw for another day if you want me to free up your van. I can swing by on my way out tomorrow. I could use the firewood. - By all means. - Oh, honey. Tucker can do it. Tucker with a chainsaw? Okay. Um, but I'm making the coffee. Deal. Everybody? If I could have your attention? Um, I'd like to take this opportunity and thank Manny and all of his peeps for working their butts off to get this place up and running again. Manny! Every now and then a storm comes along and it not only rattles your business, but it rattles your life and the choices you've made in that life. I, uh... I've always wanted a family. For whatever reason, it just wasn't in the cards. You know, maybe I... I focused too much on the business. But, uh... I would like to change that right here and right now. Miranda Wells, will you marry me? - Yeah. - Yes! All right. Here we go. Oh, sorry. You know what? Let's just put it... We'll fix that later. Whatever! She said yes! Thank you. Thank you. Woo! - I love that. - I'm so excited. - Okay. - All right. Hey. What happened to your van? Oh, it's still stuck behind a tree. But not to worry. Her handyman is gonna chop it up first thing in the morning. My handyman? Hey. Why don't I spend the night at the house so you two lovebirds can celebrate your engagement? Yeah. That would be terrific. Yeah. Um, you guys don't mind if Nana stays over? Right? - Yeah. Sure. - Yup. I'll see you in the morning. Hey. I'm gonna talk to Doug for one second. Kids, do not stay up all night long. Hey, Doug! - Congratulations, Mom. - Congrats, Tucker... Thank you. Well, let's get in the car. Goodnight, sweetie. All right. Here we go. Keep them closed. I got you. I got you. - Keep them closed. - Okay. Almost there. And... open. I spoke to Doug. I told him I wanted it here first thing this morning. And boom. Here it is. - Tucker? - I cannot have my fiancée driving around in some old minivan. What will the neighbors think? Huh! Wow. It's beautiful. Thank you. You like it? It's not, uh, too small? Like the ring? I just need to get that sized. Well, let's go do that right now. I can't, babe. I have to run errands before work. What errands? I have to get it together before Missy's party. - Party? - Her 16th birthday, silly. She talked about it last night. Right. Yeah. Sorry, I was a little distracted. Well, she's worried all of her friends are going to another party that has food trucks. Well, I can get a food truck. No. She doesn't need a food truck. She needs balloons and a cake. Well, what should I get her? Oh, nothing. Just a card. That says what? You okay? I don't wanna talk about it. - Which part? - What do you mean? Which part do you not wanna talk about? The reason you're pissed or that thing you just threw away? Both. Okay. You wanna talk about the third thing? What third thing? Well, my guess is the reason you're upset has nothing to do with that thing you threw away. How would you know that? Word is your mom got engaged. Yeah. Which I imagine stirs up a whole boatload of feelings about your dad. Yeah. Which I suspect you just took out on... whatever it is that was in that box you just threw away. Maybe. Yeah. Did it deserve it? It was just a stupid invention. You mind showing me? It's supposed to be an automatic chicken feeder for science class. If it worked, I could sell it, and we could make some money, so Mom wouldn't have to marry Tucker. And why would you say that? - She doesn't love him. - You sure about that? Not like Dad. All right. Here's the thing. I think if you took a couple links out here. Right. There. And then... you increase the tension here. That should work. It works. - You still wanna throw it out? - No way! Let me tell you something. All your dad ever wanted was for you to be happy. How would you know that? Well, because dad's are like that. Why are you so nice to us? You get what you give. - See? - That's not true. Not when you're 15. Ah, come on. I think you're selling yourself short. Kit Riley's having her party tomorrow, same day as mine. And she's having food trucks, and she's the most popular girl in school. Okay. Let me ask you a question. What would you rather have? Two hundred Instagram friends or five real ones? Five real. And are they coming here tomorrow? - Yep. - Okay. Then focus on having a good time with them. - Doing what? - I don't know. What would make you happy? Not your friends, you. Wait. If you don't know what you want, how can you ask for it? Taffy. Hmm? We used to make taffy when I was a kid. All of us. Mom loves taffy. Well, there you go. And now that you've got all this firewood, you could, uh, maybe have a bonfire down by the water, roast some hot dogs, make S'mores. How do you know about S'mores? You don't get this old without living. Mom? What the heck? Tucker. Wow. That's lot of firewood. I hear congratulations are in order. Imagine my surprise. Mom? Can we make taffy? - Taffy? - Tomorrow. For my party. There may only be six of us, but who cares? And you're totally coming, right? You have to. - Well, I don't... - Mom? Tell him he has to. I don't know what we're talking about. You better be there. What did you do? No clue. Yeah, right. Well, I'm just going to finish cleaning up and, uh, I will get out of your hair. Bray? I don't understand what's happening here. What do you mean? Well, I'm just... I don't know. I'm... I'm... I'm having a hard time believing that all of this is... any better. I guess I just have been... worried for so long that maybe I don't know how to be happy anymore. - Hey. - No. It's... Hey, hey, hey. It's fine. I'm fine. It's... Just ignore me. Look, there is... something I keep meaning to talk to you about. Just come to the party. Please. I mean, you're kind of the eye of the storm here anyway. All right. All right. What you doing, Nana? Just keeping an eye on your mother. How come? That's what you do when you love someone. Then I'm gonna watch you watch them. Oh, I'm all done watching. Oh. Let me see. Oh! Looks the same as it did last night. You are a very lucky girl. Aren't I just? Not many men would be willing to take on somebody with your baggage. That's an awful thing to say. Why? It's true. I mean, three kids, a mountain of debt. It's not a mountain. Well, it's not a molehill either. You make me sound like some sort of charity case. I just don't want you to... Oh, forget it. No. What? Blow this. I have been engaged a whole twelve hours and already... Aren't you tired of living under a cloud? Nobody ever said that life was easy. I don't want it to be easy. But I do want it to be worth it. Bobby... when are you going to stop making everything about loss and fear, rather than gain and joy? Mom! Come see what I built! - Taffy? - Yeah. It's gonna get messy, so don't wear anything too nice. Where is this coming from? Oh, Bray got her talking and she realized that she just really wants to have fun. He's gone, right? Yeah. No. She invited him, so... To a children's birthday party? Dressed as what? A clown? That wasn't very nice. It wasn't meant to be. I think it's weird. He helped me, he helped Greg, he helped Missy. Now he's helping himself to my fiancée. You're being ridiculous. Am I? He's a family friend, and he's coming to the party. Get over it. Engine failure. Losing altitude. Mayday, mayday, mayday. Help! Hey! This guy's alive! Morning, Mr. Johnson. This just arrived for you. Ah, yeah. Thank you very much, Sloane. And I printed out those documents you wanted. Excellent. Would you possibly have a manila envelope - and a pen I could borrow? - Sure thing. Next time I ask for a party, you have permission to ground me for life! Huh? I just thought it'd be nice to show off the whole new family, you know. Okay! Lights are up. Banner is hung. What else? Oh. Um... the taffy pull needs to go outside. - You got it. - Thank you. So? What's the deal with Bray? He's hot. So, does he have a girlfriend, or what? I'm pretty sure he's single. Oh. Well, I think I'll just go see if he needs some help with the fire. Oh, no! They're here! It's too early. Pretend I'm not here! I'm not here! Hi, girls! Welcome! Honey, your friends are here! What did I just say? - Are you thirsty? - Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Like this, Mommy? Yes, Bessie, that's perfect. Just make sure you keep it over the wax paper, okay? Who knew taffy was such hard work? Yeah. Yeah. Mom keeps her own stash in the glove box. Which I noticed is getting smaller and smaller. You snooze, you lose. I remember this candy store right by LSU that I discovered back when I was gonna be a nurse. You? A nurse? No way. You mean, was I actually a human being before I became a mother? Yes. Soon to be again, I hope. Wait, what? Miranda? Could I talk to you inside for a moment? Sure. Back in a flash. I wanna show you this. What am I looking at? "A sensor identifies and redistributes wasted energy into a grid that can reassign the loss into a gain." Does that sound familiar? It sounds like one of Matty's projects. - Honey, this is Matty's project. - Bobby. Saving energy's not a new thing. He called you from the hotel. He told you he met a fellow - inventor... - Matt wanted to take the heat - from the house and make it... - ...who wanted to introduce him - to some people. - ...into air conditioning. - It's not like he had a patent. - And that is why he got on the damn plane! So somebody else came up with it. So what? Well, not somebody. Bray! Next time, you might wanna Google a man you run into. That was page two! I don't understand. Your handyman was at the same convention! This is who Matty was talking about. That's the thief that stole my son's invention! You don't know that! Oh, no? Well, ask him. Bray? Is this what I think it is? - Miranda... - Answer the question. - Yes, but... - Did you know Matthew? - Yes, I... - How dare you? What the hell is going on? Tuck, stay out of this. I'm sorry. - I should've never... - Sorry about what? For lying to my face? Or stealing a dead man's idea and selling it as your own? - Oh, whoa, no. - "Maybe I'll just check on the widow, see how she's doing!" - How creepy is that? - I didn't steal Matt's idea! You need to leave! Just give me a second. We met in Vegas. I had developed this Grey Water Reclamation System, and he had this sensor, which was really smart. And he showed it to me. But sometimes it didn't work. So he asked me for my advice. We started kicking ideas around and then suddenly, out of the blue, we came up with this energy grid - for office buildings that was... - And then he died! Yes. And where were you? Sitting right next to him. You... You? The guy who survived. Because of a miracle that not only saved my life, but changed everything about it. So, you're the guy they found? You've got some nerve. Miranda, the patent just cleared last month. I brought you the papers as soon as I had them. Then the storm came and you just... You seemed so... Frail and helpless? Is that what you think of me? No. Far from it. I don't need anyone to fix me. I thought that if I could just show yo... You just need to go! You just need to get the hell out! You heard the woman. You gotta go. Are you checking out? Yep. I'm afraid I'm going to have to charge you for the night. Oh, I understand. Keep it on the same card? Please. Oh, and would you have a messenger deliver that tomorrow morning? And you can go ahead and charge that to my room too? - Sure. - Good luck with the LSAT. Thanks. I'll need it. Let me ask you something. Can you see yourself being a lawyer? Yeah. Definitely. Then so can I. Mom! There's a girl here with a package! He was so nice I figured why make him pay for a messenger when I live, like, five minutes from here. - Thank you so much. - Have a good day. That from Bray? Yeah. Well, finally. - What do you mean? - He had that with him the day I stayed home from school. I thought he was from the bank. Greg, why didn't you say anything? I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, remember? First of all, you need to know that one of your dad's inventions sold for a great deal of money. Apparently, it could be the first check of many. And I couldn't be more proud of him. Am I getting a pony? No, baby. But we do need to talk about the future. Okay, um... Let me back up a little bit, um... I was caught off guard the other night when Tucker proposed. Most people prefer that sort of thing be done in private, because it's a big deal and very intimate. And I think he was afraid I might say no, and so he hedged his bet a little by doing it in public. But the truth is, I should've discussed it with you guys first, because it affects everybody. It's not just about me. You're the one who has to sleep with him. Well, that's not the point, but thank you for that. No. The point is, what do you want, Mom? I don't know. Well, if you don't know, how are you supposed to ask for it? I guess I should figure that out, shouldn't I? Can I go back to bed now? Absolutely. Unless you wanna go to the Apple store and look at a new computer. - Really? - Mm-hmm. It's still your birthday weekend. Oh. Thank you. Thank you. It's a half hour wait. We don't have to stay. I just thought it'd be fun for you to see where Mom used to waitress. We can go. Come on. Maybe we should just skip lunch and have ice cream? - Yay, ice cream! - Dude? We're leaving. Bray told me a running back once said that before the snap, he can see the exact hole he's gonna run through. And then he trusts. He believes that his guys are gonna make their blocks. - And sure enough... - Okay, cowboy. Come on. Miranda? Party of four? I thought it was a half an hour wait. Well, the dad forgot his wallet, so they left. Touchdown! All right. Right this way, guys. Mom, stop the car! Stop the car! Stop the car! What? What is it? It's our mailbox! - Holy crap! - Missy! Wow. What's it say? "Miranda, I should've said something about all this the moment I realized who you were, and I feel really bad I didn't. I only knew Matt a few days. He was a special man who loved his family dearly." Oh! I can't believe I have to go back to work tomorrow. Oh, that's what Mondays are for. How long was I out? Well, long enough for me to finish the dishes. You've got it down to a science. Bessie? What happened? I was trying to glue her tail back on and it slipped. Now she's really dead. And my fingers are stuck together forever! Oh, no, not forever, sweetie. We just need a little nail polish remover, okay? Come on. But what about Beauty? Well, we'll ask your brother. But, you know, we might have to get a new horse. It's okay, sweetie. - Dead pony? - Yep. Remember when I stuck a kernel of corn up my nose? Yes. And you were terrified an ear of corn was gonna sprout out of your face. What brought that up? I don't know. Thinking about Bessie and how when you're younger everything seems so life and death. You okay? - Did something happen? - No. I just never would have thought... I don't know what I'm saying. Yes, you do. Just finish that sentence. Bray. What about him? I never would've thought of taffy if it weren't for him. He just made everything lighter. I mean, look at that skylight. It's totally Goodnight Moon in here. You're quite a kid, you know that? Have you called him? - No. - Why not? Mom, he's everything he said he was. He just couldn't get out of his own way is all. And the sibs and I were talking. You were so much more relaxed with him. - Do your homework. - What? You were. Honey... I barely know the man. But you liked what you knew. Now we turn to deriving an equation of motion from all of these ingredients. So let's consider an extremum principle for the motion of a mechanical system. What if we used the system of an "N" particle, subject to active forces F-I and constrained forces K-I? So, what happens when we add motion to a structured system like that? Hey, sweetheart. Thank you for our beautiful kids. I wish you could have seen their faces when I told them. You are their hero. And mine too. - Hey. - Hey! I thought you had a dentist appointment. I did. Oh, great! No more pain? I'm sorry, Tuck. I can't do this. Yeah. Okay. Don't you wanna yell at me or something? Would it change your mind? No. But I think you're wonderful. Right back at you. I should probably quit. Yeah. Thank you. It was all right there in the mailbox. Bray made Matt co-owner of the patent, even though it took him another two years to perfect it. Well, I still think he should've said something. I know. He tried. Which reminds me, um... I broke up with Tucker. What? Why? Because I don't love him. And I'm gonna go back to school. What on earth for? To continue my life. I was gonna be a nurse. - Remember? - Mm-hmm. And I was wondering, if it's not too much to ask, if you could babysit the kids this weekend? This weekend? They don't know it yet, but... I'm going on a little road trip to check out some grad programs. Look, I know that you probably think this whole second chance thing is stupid. You'd be wrong. Hi. Hi, um... I'm looking for Bray. Oh, I'm afraid he's not here. He had to take care of some business out of town. Would you like to leave a message? Oh, um... No. I was just in town and thought... Um, actually, could you tell him Miranda Wells stopped by? You're Miranda? - Yeah. - Oh, my gosh! You're the reason he's not here! I'm his sister, Jennifer. I've heard so much about you! - You have? - Yes! And... he's probably knocking on your front door right now. - Come on, Nana! - All right, okay. Oh, my gosh, you're doing it. Oh, you see that? You see that? What am I hearing in my house? Are we expecting anybody? You should have seen my face when your sister opened the door. It couldn't have been any worse than mine when Bobby answered yours. Yeah. Okay. You win. But, in a way, it all kind of worked out. She and I got to clear the air about, you know, pretty much everything, really. And your sister and I got to talk about nursing. Hey, I don't mean to be biased, but, uh, I hear Vanderbilt's got a pretty good program. Where are you right now? Um, headed north on the 59. You? I'm heading south on the 65. Just two ships passing in the night, huh? Well, unless they wanna stop for a coffee somewhere. And maybe grab a waffle? You like waffles? Oh, yeah. I particularly like the ones just off exit 47 near Tuscaloosa, which we both should be reaching, what, about sun-up? Well... what's a couple more hours when it's taken me this long to realize I can have anything I want? Then don't hang up. Are you on the right street? Oh, I see you. - You look great. - So do you. - Hi. - Hi. So, uh... Mom, where'd Bray go? Oh, he got a call from Eric Carlson up the road. Said he was having trouble with his barn. Nana, I think we need some more ornaments up here. Oh, on that side? Yes. I can see this one. Mommy! Look! It's a pony! Thank you so much, Bray. Imagine that? - Say hi? - Hi! That's so cute.
