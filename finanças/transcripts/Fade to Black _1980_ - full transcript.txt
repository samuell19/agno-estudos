I've always been your friend. Sure. You taught us how to cheat, steal, and kill. And then, you lammed out on us. Yeah, if it hadn't been for you, we might have been on the level. Sure. We might have been ding dings on a streetcar. There ain't no one here but him. I thought so. Why, you dirty double-crossing... again. Tuesday at 5:00. I've already got that one. "Dracula's Daughter." 1:15. I can't make that one. "The Big Sleep" is on at the same time. Chandler and Hawks. There's a combination. They just don't make these kind of movies anymore. I've got to see it again. Bogart in that bookstore. What are you talking about? He had plenty more coming. - What are you going to do? - "Reefer Madness" on 52. I've seen that twice. I think that's enough of that one. Um... That's the one. "99 River Street" with John Payne. I don't want to die. I should tape that one. So you don't want to die. Don't you remember you and Matt? How you used to be just kids, and we were friends? I'll do anything for you from now on. Ain't you got a heart, boy? Don't you remember how I used to play to you? Didn't I always stick up for you? I ain't got this coming. I ain't a bad fellow, really Tommy... Tommy, don't. Ain't you got a heart? Get over there. I want that dough. You can't bring in one, bring in the other. - Eric? - I'll bring you both. Leave it to me, kid. Alright. Come on, Matt. Shake a leg. Well, look here. Mr. Smart fell asleep with his nose buried in the screen again. That one-eyed monster is gonna wreck his eyes, much less soften his brain. You spend all your time daydreaming, watching those silly movies. I didn't ask you for any lip. I asked you if you had a drink. I know, Tom, but... There you go with that wishing stuff again. I wish you was a wishing well, so that I could tie a bucket to you, and sick you. Good morning. Have you looked at yourself lately? You look like hell. Stop making those faces. Let me tell you something... If you don't listen to me and start taking care of yourself, you'll never reach 30. When I took you in after your sweet mother died giving birth to you, I had no idea you would be such a trial. Your mother was beautiful. She was a great talent. Hollywood was at her feet. Important men were begging to marry her. Then, she met your father, that bastard. It was the end of our dance team. You know... I was a fine dancer. The best. Yeah, I know, Ma. You were the greatest dancer ever. Magnificent. And you... you made me leave that party. Little bellyacher. If it weren't for you, I'd still have my legs. I didn't ask the sitter to call. I was sick. Shut up! I was 4 years old. I said "Shut up"! You're worthless, just like your father was. Yeah, I know. I wish you'd eat your breakfast the way you devour those tapes. Brain food is what you need, not escapist trash. You know, you talk too much. One of these days, you're gonna eat those words, Stella. Wipe that smirk off your face. That grapefruit is a tonic. It provides vitamin C without the acid. Listen to me for a change. Now where are you going? Sit back down, and eat your breakfast. You can't go to work on an empty stomach. Have a nice day... Auntie. Why don't you live in the real world, with the rest of us? No, thanks. If you're so smart, Stella, tell me what James Cagney's name was in "White Heat." I don't know, and I don't give a damn. Arthur Cody Jarrett. That's who. Stop filling your head with all that useless trivia. Top of the world, Ma. I'm not your mother. It's Aunt Stella, Bird Brain. This place... reminds me of "The Big House," 1930. Broderick Crawford, Lynne Cheney Jr., Charles Bronson. "Man got man in cages without reason." Eric, Berger wants those slotted. Sid, what the hell are you talking about? Now, look, those ads were delivered yesterday afternoon. Come on, cut it out. Look, my kid delivered them at two o'clock. Alright, Sid. Okay. Just pay your bill, and we'll deliver you another batch. Hey, look, mistakes happen. Okay, Sid. That's fine with me... you schmuck. Binford, you're a fuck-up! You didn't deliver to Sid Fine yesterday afternoon. Mr. Berger, I told you that the one sheets weren't ready. Bullshit! And you're late again, huh? Now, you deliver this stuff. And your late time is coming out of your paycheck. That's if you last a week. Now, get out of here. Mr. Berger, could I have a couple of dollars, please? A couple of bucks? What for? I have to put some gas in the vespa. What the hell are you talking about? The vespa's already gassed up. No... it's not. And I lost the petty cash. You lost the petty... I am trying to run a business, here. It's also coming out of your paycheck. Now, please, get out of my life, will you?! Here's a list of the juvenile offenders you're going to meet first. A bunch of real beauties. Should all be locked up, but the judge handed them over to you. Well, by giving them jobs to pay back their debt to society makes a hell of a lot more sense than jailing them at the taxpayer's expense, wouldn't you say? Bullshit. Captain, they're still waiting for you at roll call. I'll prove that to you. Alright, Rogers, I'll be right there. Okay. What? I said I'll prove it to you. Listen, I'm required to give you some space, and you've got about six months to make this whole thing work. Now, how do you plan on doing that? First of all, by gaining their trust. Oh. I like that. I like that. Gain their confidence, and we nail them with the information you get, right? No way, Gallagher. My material is strictly confidential. Anne, you want to come in here, please? You know, Moriarty, for an Irishman, you've got a real thick skull. Anne Oshenbull, Dr. Moriarty. How do you do? I've heard a lot about you. Never mind. Never mind. Just show him to his office, will you? Oh, incidentally, Irish, we're a little short on parking space. That's okay, Captain. I ride a bike. Oh, Jesus. A conservation kook on top of everything. Are you another cop that doesn't believe in my program? I don't know enough about it yet. Well, at least you're willing to give me a chance... Which is more than Gallagher. Gallagher's alright. He's just trying to be a tougher cop than his dad was. Yeah? What happened to his dad? He got shot to death by some doped up kid in a dark alley. Well, here's your new home. It used to be the drunk tank. Not exactly a place to counsel San Francisco housewives, is it? How did you know about that? Oh, I know everything about you, Dr. Moriarty. It's all in his file. Anything incriminating? No. No. The FBI finally closed their political file on you, but your personal file was fascinating. Oh, yeah? What did it say? Well, let's just say that it was definitely interesting enough for me to want to meet you. Now, here you are... in the flesh. Marilyn, first it was the Scarsdale diet, and now it's jogging. You get into every fad. When in Rome. Besides, I've got to get in shape. I'll never be a model with these thighs. Oh, not that again. Listen, I want to be somebody. I want to get treated with a little respect for once. Well, you've got a lot of guys. Oh, sure... when their girlfriends are out of town. Well, at least you have an interesting job. Extremely. Handing out roller skates... A fate only worse than death. Everyone back home in Australia would think I was a big slop, or something. Oh, look. Would you stop worrying about it? I've had enough. I'm hungry. Let's pig out. Here he is. Hey, Binford, settle this, will you? What was the fat man's name in "The Maltese Falcon"? That's easy. Okay, okay. What is it? What do you give me? Hey, come on, man. We ain't got all day. What was it. It's Kasper Gutman. Listen... I got one for you guys... Only it's gonna cost you money this time. Yeah? What's the bet? "Casablanca." I know that film backwards and forwards. I've seen it 50 times. Great. Only you got to come up with the answer in 48 hours, or you pay me 20 bucks each. Alright. No sweat. What do we get if we get it right? I'll give you $50. I think it's a trick. No, no, no. Wait. Wait. Only no fair looking at the print or reading the script in the meantime. Hey, you know I know the film better than anybody. Are you sure this isn't a sucker bet, Binford? There's no tricks. The answer's in the film. So, put up or shut up. It's a deal. It's a lot of dough, but it's a deal. What was Rick's full name? You mean Rick who owns the cafe? No.The Bogart character? Yeah. It's a cinch. Wait a minute. I got it on the end of my tongue. It's... Take your time, Richie. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I know it like I know my own name. Hey, forget it, man. Binford is... He's sick in the head. He's, like, retarded or something. We made a bet, right? Yeah. Yeah. Forget it. A bet's a bet. He's gonna pay us. He's certainly a low-class production. Yeah, he's a space case, or something. He's a real asshole. How about the usual, Eric? Two chocolate doughnuts, hot dog with the works, fries, large Coke? You know, I went to high school with this girl who looked exactly like Lauren Turner. I always sort of felt like she looked down on me. Well, anyway, she went to Hollywood to be a big star. What happened to her? She killed herself because she didn't make it big. Really. That won't happen to me. Don't worry. Yeah, well, it better not. Okay, look. No more advice. As of this minute, you're on your own. Are you an actress? No.It's amazing. You look exactly like... We know. We know. Everybody says that. I'm sorry. I just wanted to meet you. I'm a great admirer. Enchante. I'm Marilyn O'Connor. What are you doing? Cut it out. He's kind of cute. What was the name of the movie that Tom Ewell took you to see in "Seven Year Itch"? I forgot. Is it famous? It's a horror movie. Um... let me think. Don't encourage him. I'll give you a clue. He was green and slimy. Oh, my God. "Frankenstein." "The Werewolf." Now, you're just guessing Who the hell cares? It was "Creature From the Black Lagoon." Stupid. Now you've hurt his feelings. Hey. Hey. Hey, how did you know that? That's great. I go to a lot of movies. It's my thing. Thrilling. I love movies. Could you give me a lift back to work? Are you serious? Just watch me. I have two wheels, not for. Fabulous. Bye, Stacy. Keep the change. I'll catch you later. You know, I once went to three movies every day for a year, and I never missed once. You're lucky. In my town in the Australian outback, this man would come out in a truck, and show the same two movies over and over again. What were they? "Mary Poppins" and "The Sound of Music." You're a big Julie Andrews fan, huh? The only overdose of Julie. Well, someday, I'm gonna own my own movie theater, and I'm gonna show whatever film I want, whenever I want. And you can come. Where do you live? In Venice. With your parents? Uh, well, sort of. Not really. No. Do you stay in touch with your folks much? I never knew mine. My father was a drover. That's a sheepherder, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. That's right. How'd you know that? I saw it in "The Sundowners" with Robert Mitchum. Oh, thanks. You're darling. Bye. See you in the movies. Okay. When? How about tonight? Sure. Where? Ships, Westwood, at eight o'clock. Fab. What movie will we see? That's a surprise. Oh. Bye. Bye. Wow, baby! I said, "Hey, baby." I could never get that one. Boy, that wore me out. The damage to buildings and human life is estimated in the millions. I saw the explosion just disintegrated in the air. Look at this clown. Kind of reminds me of Gallagher. Gallagher is an okay guy. He just doesn't agree with your methods. That's all. Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say, Annie, you know, you're you're a cop. I'm not a cop. He won't listen to me. To him, I'm some throwback to the hippie wars, But people hate anything that's different. Listen, I had a partner, and he refused to get in the patrol car with me because I'm a woman. You know what he said? He said that he didn't join the Snatch Squad. Snatch Squad, eh? Yeah. Has a real ring to it. Why did you join the force? For the money. No. I joined you because, listen, it's like you said, you know, up last week, a girl in San Diego picked a rifle up. She killed her neighbors, and claimed she saw it on TV. That's what I'm talking about. How about the teenager who stabbed his friend 22 times, and said it wasn't like on television. The knife only went in a little ways. A couple was shot and killed, causing a two-car collision at the central off ramp of the Glendale Freeway. It just bugs me. I'm obsessed with the subject, and it freaks me out, because we're planting these crazy images inside of these children's heads. Please stay tuned for "Stagecoach," starring John Wayne. Do you really use this thing? Yeah. ...Orange, and San Diego counties,. The weather outlook for tomorrow is clear. It makes a big bang. ...dropping to a low of 69. A fifth-stage smog alert is predicted for most of... I never fucked a cop before. We're out of quarters again. I'm sorry. But there's this long line of freaked out New Yorkers at the taco stand, acting like they never saw a burrito before. God, I could have killed them. Hi, Marilyn. How are you doing? Okay. How are you? Good. - Oh, Marilyn. A special delivery package came for you. I put it under the counter. Ooh. Oh. It must be from a wealthy fan. Oh, yeah. Big spender. Those are selling for 2 bucks on the pier. No wonder you're jealous. I love it. Is that any way to treat a soldier? But I'm telling you, Chief. Never give a sucker and even break and always keep an eye on a pal. Remember that. Well, you're looking res elegant. Thanks, my dear. You even cleaned up your room. Are you sure you feel alright? Certainly, my dear. I have a most important date with a most important young lady. I'm Greta Garbo if you're Cary Grant. You're absolutely correct, my dear. Absolutely correct. Who is this young lady? Miss Marilyn Monroe. Sorry, darling... must dash. Oh... Aunt Stella. ...may I have a small loan at the usual rate of interest, please? On one condition... That you come straight home right after the movie. I want my back rub tonight. They tell me the dreams reveal quite a bit about a person's inner secrets. Oh, no. I have these horrible nightmares about losing my makeup. What does that mean? I don't know. I had a dream about photographing Marilyn Monroe last night. How'd it go? I don't know. The proofs haven't been developed yet. I'm starved. - Excuse me. - What time? Uh, it's about nine o'clock. Thank you.Sure. Where is she, Hoppy? What do you say we go over to my studio? It's just around the corner. Do you mind if we have some dessert? No. You can have anything you want. Marilyn, I... Excuse me. Hi. I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else. Excuse me, did you see a blond girl about my height, uh, looking for somebody? She has big red lips and real blond hair. I forgot. I was supposed to meet this guy in Westwood hours ago. Come on. Look, I've got to go. What's the matter? Don't you like men? Don't flatter yourself. Excuse me. Do you know what time the next bus is, please? I ain't waiting for no bus. I'm working. Work at night, huh? Where do you work? Where are you headed? Shut up, will you, numb nuts? I'm trying to hitch a ride on my back. Get it? I have 10 bucks. What about me? 10 bucks? For what? Cat food? Get lost. I hope you freeze your balls off... If you got any. Go to hell. You think a squealer can get away from me? Huh? You know what I do to squealers? I let them have it in the belly, so they can roll around for along time, thinking it over. You're worse than cancer, telling me they're coming back. You lying old hag. Eric! Come out of there! Let me go. If you don't open up, I'm going to use the key. Eric, you're hopeless. What is this? You can't stay in here forever. This isn't a charity ward. Either you go to work, to eat, or you can find yourself another place to live. This is my vile, watching movies again, and spending all your money on films! Jesus Christ! I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry. Look at this place. This room is a disgrace. Eric, come in here now! Damn thing. Eric, get in here, now. Get in here right now! Eric! Eric, I have had it. I want you to get rid of all this junk. Do you hear me? Move it. You ruined it. You ruin everything. I said "Move it"! Move it! I can't stop the chair. Eric! Eric! Eric, I can't stop the chair! Eric! Eric! 20th Century Fox Presents "Kiss of Death," starring Victor Mature, Brian Donlevy, Colleen Gray... ...with Richard Windmark... Taylor Holmes... Howard Smith... ...Karl Malden. - What do we do? - I'm gonna call an ambulance. Stella Binford led a life of piety and quiet Christian charity that touched all who knew her, generous to a fault, both to her friends, loved ones, and to her church. We commit her spirit to the Almighty, and pray for her eternal salvation, that her wondrous soul may find peace in Heaven as it did on earth. Amen. I'm sorry, Eric, but there was just no room next to Miss Monroe's crypt. But that's where I wanted her, Reverend. Well, there are other nice sites. Thank you. Come. Come. Walk with me. Now, here are the ashes. Why don't you take them home? Live with them for a couple of days. There's no hurry. You have plenty of time to decide... Say, till Friday, okay? I really have got to go, because I've got to service another funeral. I have a christening, and I have a wedding. In fact, it's a double ceremony. But if there's anything that you need, my boy, you call me, okay? But preferably before six. Oh, Eric, I'll see you tomorrow, now, at your aunt's memorial service. No. I don't believe in God. Well, God still believes in you, Eric. Here's to your good health... ...Aunt Stella. Oh! Eric, you're still here. I thought maybe you'd move because of your aunt's... You know, the name change. And listen, I'm really sorry. I don't know what you're talking about. The name is Jarrett. Got it? Cody Jarrett. Strange bird. Watch this. Shh. Oh! Drunk again. Drinking alone. I only wanted your autograph. Listen to the children of the night. What lovely music they make. I believe we've met before, my child. What's your act, anyway? Uh, not that I care. Are you engaged this evening? Uh, yeah. Yeah. As a matter of fact, I'm late to another appointment. But maybe some other time. Hey, there's Binford. Let's get on his case. - Sure. good deal. Hey, Binford, take a look at this. - Leave him alone. - So what? Paper says there was 100 Draculas at the marathon last night. Where were you? Were you there? Huh? Huh? What are you gonna do, you little baby? He does nothing. You little shithead. Come on, man, let's make it. We're late. Hey, you guys. You owe me 40 bucks For what? The "Casablanca" bet. Remember? Rick's last name? No, Eric, we still have time for that. - Yeah, till tomorrow. - Tomorrow was last week. I want my money. Eric, forget it. What are you looking at? What are you looking at? You creep. Eric, you keep... You keep messing with me, and I'm gonna kick your ass. Besides, Binford, anything you know ain't worth the price of admission. You didn't know what Adolf Hitler's favorite movie was. "Broadway Melody." I bet you didn't know that. And what about "Cry of Battle" and "War is Hell"? Where were they playing, huh? At the Texas theater where they caught Oswald the day he shot Kennedy. I bet you didn't know that. It was a double bill, you... shit. Why, El Toro ain't been this side of the border in five years. Here comes Bill Cassidy. What's going on, here? You're headed for trouble, and I'm stringing along. This is something personal, Johnny. I got a job to do. You win the piggy. - How much is this one? - Two balls for 50¢. I'll be right back. - Oh. Sure. This is great. Let's play this. Hey, man, I don't want to play these games all night. Don't you want to get laid? Sure. This place is. Let's go check it out. That's what you said about this place, you know? You gonna bust my chops all night long? I'm not gonna bust your chops. But, you know, that's what she said. The night is young. Let's do it. Give me that thing. We ain't gonna pick nothing up with all this shit. What did you do that for? That's what I'd like to do to Binford. The guy really bothers me. Hey, Jack, where you hiding all the pussy, man? Las Vegas. I lived there for four years. Las Vegas. We ain't gonna go to Las Vegas. I feel like a moron carrying this damn teddy bear up and down this pier. Keep it, man. The broads eat that shit up. If they eat this shit up, then why don't you carry it for a while? Okay? What's that noise, anyway? Oh, my gosh. Looks like somebody's celebrating Halloween a little early this year, huh? Hey, no, man, that's William Boyd. Friend of yours? No. This is the famous Hopalong Cassidy, right? I think he's calling you out. Hopalong Cassidy. Oh, look at this. You want to play games? This is some toy you got here, Hoppy. Make your move, hombre. Oh, I think he's crazy. You want to go a round? Draw. Start dancing, cowboy. Hey, come on, man. What are you doing? Come on, Richie. He's crazy. Come on. Richie, Come on. What you doing? Are you nuts, man? Say your prayers. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm sorry. What? Why? What are you doing, man? Take it easy. Please. On your knees. - What are you doing? - Both knees. I didn't do anything to you. Why are you doing this? How does it feel, now, Richie? Binford? You think the cops suspect me of killing Richie, even though I was his best friend? Cops are paid to suspect everybody and catch no one. Gallagher is just another flatfoot. What about that Moriarty character, and his test? It's just a bunch of stupid questions. They even had Mr. Berger in here last night, and he's a nervous wreck. And he's got to go to the hospital next week for his operation. What operation? A bypass operation? His heart's worse, man. I didn't think he had one. How are they gonna find Ricky's killer? Bart... if you can't identify him, who can? See you. You know, that Binford kid was a little strange. Yeah? He seemed harmless enough. Moriarty. What the hell are you trying to pull? We questioned all those CFS employees very carefully... Normal police procedure. Now, who the hell gave you the authority to test them? I cooked up this questionnaire to help flush out a suspect. Flush? That's exactly the right word. For the way I'm feeling about your actions. For your information, this is the only real fucking piece of evidence that we have. I don't agreeCaptain Gallagher, Moriarty's really got something, here. Three of them tested red... Eric Binford, Maria Valdez, Herman. Maria Valdez, the broad in the shipping department, is a killer? Oh, that's terrific. Thank you very much, Sherlock. Also, the newspapers think there is a link between the Dracula murder and this cowboy caper. One of the victims was a stock boy in an advertising firm, the other a hooker. Now, where's the connection? It's obvious. We've got to stop this killer from further... We? When the hell did you join the police force? Just trying to help out, Captain. Listen, I don't need your psycho test to help me find a killer. And just in case you didn't notice, nobody's asking for your help, so knock it off. Captain, I know the human mind... Especially the sick ones. Well, fuck the mind, okay? Keep your nose out of police business. I can't stand stupidity. Jerry. Just tell him to call me. Hop in, fella. I'll check with you later. Thanks a lot. Where you headed? Venice, near the pier. This is beautiful. This an Auburn? Yeah. What year? '34. Are all these scripts yours? Yeah. I used to be an actor. Now, I'm producing. I'm in the film business, too. Really? I have this idea for a movie. You wouldn't be interested, would you? Sure. Maybe I can help you. Thanks. You are the Gary Bially, aren't you? Yeah. You produced "The Big Ripoff," right? Yep. I do four pictures a year. Keep it. Listen, this idea for my movie, It's sort of like an early '50's Sam Fuller piece, you know? Kind of a story about these two crooks, and they break out of jail, and they join up with this carnival of convicts. What's it called? "Alabama and the 40 Thieves." Not bad, kid. Tell me more. Well, I thought maybe we could do it in black and white, you know, and you could get Peter Bogdanovich do it. And I get some great ideas on casting. Mr. Bially, listen, right here is fine. You know something, kid? You've got a real feel for film. Look, Eric, I have to come to my next screening. Really? Yeah. Call me at the studio sometime. Jesus. Well, thanks. Sure. Don't mention it. Thanks a lot. Oh. I'll call you. Thank you. You bet. Bye. Aunt Stella, it's our lucky day. We finally made it. I just met this producer, and he liked my idea for the movie, and he's gonna do it. And we're gonna be rich. And we're not gonna have to worry about a thing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We finally made it, Ma. And it hurts. It hurts bad, Ma. Hey! What room are you in? What are you talking about? Did you know, when this was the Hollywood Studio Club, that Gale Storm, and Sharon Tate, and then Marilyn Monroe all lived in room 334. Give me a break. Bet you didn't know that, huh? Kenneth Anger would love the Boulevard today... Hollywood Babylon on parade. $2.76. Did you ever Marilyn Monroe coming out of the Brown Derby? She's been dead for years, man. You're wrong. What are you talking about? I said you're wrong. She's alive, like you and I! She's dead! She's dead, you jerk! Look, Eric, you've been here for over an hour. Are you gonna buy anything or not? You've got most of these anyway. I'll Just take these. Pay up front. Eric, watch your money? He's on his way. You've got to believe me, officer, he is coming to Hattenfield. Because I know him. I'm his doctor. You must be ready for him. If you don't, it's your funeral. Hello, beauty. I'm sorry, Marilyn. What the hell is the matter with you, Binford? I could have you arrested for stealing company property. I needed wheels... And something to do. Oh, I see. That's an answer. Why don't you buy a car with the insurance money your aunt left you? That's none of your business. You keep your Goddamn hands off me. You know, I've been hearing all kinds of things about you, lately, Binford. You mean like my wedding? Now that is one I haven't heard. I can't picture the creature who'd want to marry you. Tell me, who is this unlucky girl? She's a famous actress. And who might this famous actress be? Marilyn Monroe. Oh, shit. Hand over the keys, Binford. The name's Cody, got me. Oh, snap out of it, punk. Your name is not Cody. Cody Jarrett. And don't ever forget it. Get your Goddamn hands off me, and get the hell out of here. You're fired. Too late. I quit. Okay. So, where do you think you're going? Out of my way. This is my place of business. You're not going inside. Mr. Berger... my posters are valuable originals, and I want them Well, you forget them. 'Cause anything inside belongs to me. It might help to pay for some of your screw-ups. Nobody pushes Cody around. You'll be sorry, Bid Ed. You get off my property, you little jerk. Who needs you? This is the best thing that could have happened to me. Why, you rotten son of a bitch. I'll have your ass for this! Your ass, you hear me? You little bastard. Rotten little bastard. Where do you get your Goddamn nerve? Who does he think he is? Who the hell does he think he is? Mr. Berger, sir. Jesus Christ, Sam. You scared the shit out of me. Could I go out for some coffee, sir? I'll only be a minute.Yeah. Alright. Go ahead. You better get me a cup, too. You want cream and sugar? No. Make it black. I'm gonna be here half the night correcting these invoices that Binford lost up. Yes, sir. And Sam. For God's sakes, wear a bell. Sam, you still here? Is anything working right around here? Is anybody there? Control yourself, Berger. God damn it, get ahold of yourself. Jesus. Is anybody there? Damn stock boys. No lights in here, either. What the hell's going on in this place anyway? God almighty. Huh. Sam. But instead, let's get to the hot news for the viewers. I love your new film, Gary. Well, that's really nice coming from you, Eve. I'll tell you, it was a tough film to make. And we got mixed reviews, but I'm very proud of it. So, how do you get that special chemistry in your films, Gary? They're all so distinctive. Well, I think you just have to have a feel for it. And I think I have that feeling. You just have to have a gut instinct. That's great. Now, what's next on your breakneck schedule? Oh, I'm glad you asked me that, Eve. It's a real departure for me... A grassroots story called "Alabama and the 40 Thieves." That sounds fascinating. Now, when your ideas come from, if you don't mind my asking. Well, in different ways This time... let me see. I was feeling kind of down, and I went out and bought a 1934 Auburn speedster car. A car? Oh, yeah. And it just flashed on me when I was driving home after a meeting with Dick and David.

And remember, Hollywood, I love you. How'd it go? Oh, they'll love it in Chicago. Phone for you, Mr. Bially. It sounds urgent. - Right. Go ahead, Gary. Lunch tomorrow. Sure. Sushi. Ciao. Hello. Oh, hi. Is this Gary Bially? - Yeah, - It's Eric Binford... "Alabama and the 40 Thieves." You must be mistaken, friend. I've never heard of you. Remember? You picked me up hitchhiking. I gave you the whole idea from my movie. Now, firstly, son, I never pick up hitchhikers. And secondly, we never accept outside material. Look, you said that I ought to call you. Look, I'm sorry, pal. I'd love to help you, but I can't. Sure. Bye, now. Take care. Yeah, bye. Mr. Bially. Please deposit ¢25 for overtime. Great Big Ed. You know why they call him that? 'Cause his ideas are big. Someday, he's gonna get a really big one about me. It'll be his last. Oh, you shouldn't have. really. Make a wish.Okay. It feels like shoes. I need them. Gucci. Fantastic. Oh, 9 1/2. Well, that's alright. I can exchange them. No problem. Come on, sweetheart. You got work to do. "Happy birthday to you from us. Is there something very special that you'd like your day to bring? Well, here's a wish right from the heart for just that very thing. Happiness always." Oh, that's great. Really. I hope I have it. Yeah. Yeah. Really. Happy birthday, sucka. A real live birthday card. Shit. Which one of your jokers is responsible for this? That's great. Bob? Kim? That's too, too much. Everybody out. That's it. That's pretty good. Hey, who hired you, huh? Never mind that. Stay put, big shot. Hey, uh, I think you're carrying this gag a little too far. Sure. It's gonna be a lot of laughs. Try this on for size. Jesus Christ. What do you want from me? Not much from you, you dirty rat. In fact, nothing at all. Who are you? Me? Nobody. You remember. You're somebody. Wait. You're making a big mistake. I could do a lot for you. But not for long, Mister. You've got nice pipes, pal. Drop by the club sometime. Maybe I can do something for you. God, these people around here have all got brain damage. You brought us down here. Oh, well, it's good to go shopping here, at his favorite hangout, huh? Hey, this is cute. Oh, Marilyn, you don't need another t-shirt. You've got enough for three baseball teams. Just 'cause you invest all your money in gold and silver doesn't mean that I have to dress like an orphan. Okay, suit yourself. Hey. Look at these photos. There are wild. They're by the same guy that wants me for this modeling job. What job? His secretary called me at the skate shop, and said that they wanted a model that looked like Marilyn Monroe. Ah. When? Tonight. Mm-hmm. Well, you're not going alone. Good guess, honey. You've got a car, and I don't. Marilyn, you're one of a kind. You said you're my best friend. Alright, I'll go with you. We'll check it out. There's a lot of phony photographers, you know? Sounds quite legit, if you ask me. You're so naive. Thanks. I wonder what the prize is for these things. I think we got ourselves a real whacko, here. Captain, listen to me. Binford is not crazy. He's a victim of a society. Believe me. Oh, that's beautiful. The man runs around in a Dracula and a mummy outfit killing people, but he's okay. Oh, geez. Captain Gallagher, most of his stuff's been moved out. But we found these pictures and this. May I see those, please? What for? It's police business All film-related, yes? Right. Anne, why don't you bag these? I'll take a look at them later. Yeah, okay.Alright. Let's wrap it up, here. Why do you think he covered up the street sign with this? 99 River Street, You can damn well be sure it has something to do with the movies. Alright, now, look at this. Why do you suppose Binford changed his name to Jarrett? Here. Yeah, this is it. Blow-up Photo Studio. Hey, look at that funny old car. These must be props. "C. Jarrett." Is this the place? "To enter, press asterisk, pull open door." Wow. What a layout. Maybe this guy's legit after all. Of course he is. All these high-fashion photographers sleep all day. They work all night. Do I look alright? Yeah. You look great. I'll pick you up later. Do you have to go now? Can't you stay a minute? You'll be alright. Thanks for the lift.Bye. Bye. Good luck. I'll need it. Jerry my shift has been over for hours. Can't we stop for a while? Every cop in the city is looking for Binford's Packard. No way. I'm not gonna let Gallagher beat us. How do you do? So good of you to come on such short notice, Miss Marina. I did some research at the academy. You know what I found out? "Cody Jarrett" was Cagney's name in "White Heat." My name is Marilyn O'Connor. And who are you? I am the regent of Carpathia, prince of Hungary. What? Why no cause for alarm, my dear. For tonight, we shall recreate "The Prince and the Showgirl." You know, Gallagher and I found out something, too. Stella Binford was Eric's mother, not his aunt. It seems that she got knocked up back when a scandal like that could ruin her dance career. You know, she never told Eric the truth. Christ. Binford never had a chance. Poor little weasel. Most amusing. The time... 1911. This city... London. We are destined to meet. You are the beautiful American showgirl, and I... am but a lonely prince. At first, I resist you. But fate takes a hand. But I know who you really are. Why is there so much traffic tonight? 743, all units, unconfirmed sighting of a 1934 Packard. Proceed to 190 Warton Drive. - That's right around here. - I know a shortcut. Eric Binford, where are you? Who is that? Wake up. It's over. Jerry, what the hell do you think you're doing? Drop it. No! Stop right now. You're Eric Binford. We can help you, Eric. Who? Binford, you're out of your fucking mind! Who the hell is Eric Binford? Come on. You and your Goddamn therapy? Get me to the car. Okay. Get up. Lean on me. Oh, my leg. Are you gonna be alright? Yes. Yes. Fine. Why do you think they're on Hollywood Boulevard? Because his whole life is a movie. There he is. Binford, hold it! Gallagher is gonna be here in three minutes. He's ordered us to wait. Jesus Christ, Anne, why didn't you give me a chance to get ahold of him first? God damn it! Eric! Eric Binford, let me talk with you. I don't need to talk to you. Please let her go. Forget it. She's mine. Eric, trust me. I'm a friend. I know all about you now. You don't know nothing, see? You're nothing but a stinking copper. I own this place. And nobody... Nobody takes Cody alive. No. No. No. You don't need this anymore. Run, lady! Run! Where is he? Inside. Everybody in position? Fine. Now, listen to me. Nobody fires unless he fires first. You understand? You finally got the slimy bastard cornered, right? Captain, listen. No matter what he is, try and remember he's only a sick kid who needs help. That's what I'm here for... To help him. You can't kill Binford in cold blood. We're not gonna do that. But if he fires on anyone, you'll be the first to feel his pulse. He's there. Get them back! Eric! Give yourself up! Moriarty, get the hell out of there! Get out of there! This is it. This is Hollywood. Look at those ants down there! You little! You don't know your own minds! You can't touch me. Not now. What are you doing? Didn't you hear what...? They don't even know how to shoot. You can't take Cody Jarrett alive. Don't you know that? You can't take Cody alive. Please, come with me. There's still something more I got to do. Here's to us. Top of the world. We was gonna be together, sweetheart. Just take these. This is my story. This is Arthur Cody Jarrett, and this is my story. Alright. You can't keep them waiting. Nobody waits for me. Exactly where the hell is he now? There he is. Eric, there's still time! He points that weapon this way, you hit him. You understand? You hear me? He points that thing, hit him. Gallagher... Shut up! Give me a chance. I'm ready now, Ma. I'm Cody Jarrett, remember? I'm the duke. The man of 1,000 faces. The prince of darkness. I'm the thin man. I'm Little Caesar. I'm the man I made it, Ma! I finally made it, Ma. Top of the world! Top of the world.
