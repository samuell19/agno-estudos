That's five dollars. That's a dollar. Six dollars. It's one dollar. It was... it was a sex scandal that I can't really talk about... So, they had to cut me back a little bit. - Have a great night. - Alright, see ya. You make me want to dance. Cars are weird, they're like this whole other species of animal. Humans interact with them and obviously we like control them but in this other certain way, they have their own set of controls. When you're walking down the street, it's not like if you bump into somebody you start screaming at them and giving them the finger like right to their face. But when you're in a car, you seem to feel that you have this super power. People are wed to their cars and it's part of the American identity is to have your car. And your car will set you free, you know the car is the extension of the horse, and the myth of the exploration of the west and what not. You got your car, and I personally loved the idea of people being trapped by their cars. The parking was the place where people were finally realizing that their car was not just means to liberation but actually something of an encumbrance. And that you had to pay, because you needed a place for your car you had to pay. And to me there was some fundamental component of justice in that. We're the victors. We are the champions, my friend. Ultimately, you have the car and you need to park that car somewhere. And sooner or later you will come back and need to park with us. And then you belong to us. My first reaction to seeing Trustafarians get out of a 40,000 dollar vehicle that gets 8 miles to the gallon is I hate you. But I'm not going to do anything because I'm dealing with my hatred positively. By, uhm, grinding my teeth into nubs. People think I'm just a pedestrian sort of thing a peking lot, you know, they hear that and then they put blinders on the ear plugs, then the rest of the story... On the wrong of employment, it's beneath taxidermy. It's beneath bellhop. Bellhops get uniforms. I think that the parking lot attendant is the tollbooth operator on the expressway to the weigh station to the American Dream. It's kind of a Bermuda Triangle in a way. It's actually kind of triangular in shape. It helped preserve, much like beautiful wild animals. It was like a refuge from the rest of Charlottesville right in the middle of Charlottesville. It was like a wildlife refuge. The parking lot is located directly opposite from the University of Virginia, behind a number of horrible bars. So, it's pretty much guaranteed to produce some sort of class struggle any night the week. It's a strange location. I mean you're on the back of a restaurant. I mean, it's not the prettiest thing. You see the back of every building and on a bad day you can smell the dumpster. The booth is rather informal looking. It looks like something that you might discover in Albania, at the border. And some people would kind of belittle it, other people just saw the inherent sort of beauty of that building, it was such a humble, simple space. Really it was just the bare bones. A roof, four walls and a little step. That's the kind of building that Jesus would've collected parking fees from. How's it goin'? Pretty good, it's one dollar please. - Thank you. - Thanks. How you doin'? Twelve thirty, one thirty... It's three dollars, please. Like, whenever somebody asks me "What do you do?" I mean my first inclination is to laugh. You know? And I still do it, twenty one years later, I'm like well it's pretty absurd but I own a parking lot. And they're like "Really?" Chris is a leader, I mean it's his business. He holds the gate. He's the key master the gate keeper, both of that job. Uh, we're full, I'm sorry, you can try the garage right over there. - I will do that, thank you. - Okay, thanks. You're welcome. Hey. Chris definitely, uhm... is a key figure in this world. The mastermind! Uh... The man behind the curtain. I don't know. Uh, eight dollars. I've done a lot of traveling. Younger. And I'd always admired guys in little stores. Like I remember this one guy in Morocco that had this Orange Juice stand. And he didn't even have a door built to get inside the stand, so he constantly he hopped outside, over the counter to sit and when a customer would come, he'd hop back in and make the orange juice. And a lot of his day was just kind of sitting there, interacting with people. And I'd always admired that kind of business man. Chris' genius was in identifying and relating to people and getting them to relate to him as a person. Not a boss. Not the owner. Not an authority figure, but as a friend and someone that you wanted to be loyal to because you had such a strong stake in operations, you know, who cared about the place. His business model was really to create a de-centralized network of attendants who were also de-facto managers. De-facto owners. For all anyone knew that parked there, the guy in the booth that day was the owner. And it's almost like he assembled this rag-tag group of fractured poets that were somehow, in a sense, like himself. Yeah, we were certainly capable of great things. But none of us would probably ever achieve it, because, you know what? We were too damn arrogant, too damn hard-dead. I think I saw it as more of just otherwise unemployable misfits. Who he had a gift or a curse of being able to recognize, and give them a job. I always thought that Chris had a real spiritual advisor quality to him. - I need your key, thanks man. - Alright, buddy. It's not like I'm thinking the way businesses do, in terms of how you treat your customers. To me it's all about how I'm treating my employees. The customers are coming after, I mean the customers are cars. I don't worry, as long as I don't damage the car, they're fine. It's more of just how you treat your employees. - Hey, how are you doing? - Great, how are you? I eventually will have like, arthritis in my thumb because of straightening out one dollar bills for forty years, you know? So it's very direct. It's in your pocket. On one hand, yes, I am a boss, though I don't consider myself boss. People would bring certain assumptions to play in their interactions with attendants that to them seem perfectly rational, and maybe are rational and re-enforced elsewhere in consumer culture. Uhm... You know, the notion that the customer is always right? Uhm, the notion that... If you have money, you have a right to get whatever that money can buy you. Uhm... And those are things that are, you know if not taken for granted in our society are at least, pretty often the case. But in the parking lot, they are simply not true. I've seen those guys working in the other parking lots. They don't know how kush easy they got it. They're always sitting there in their air conditioned heater things, they don't leave the booth, they're not moving amongst the people. They're not doing anything. They think they're parking lot attendants but they have no clue. Turn around, culprit. Turn around. Ow! Turn around. It will hurt less. That's like the word of the day of the parking lot, it's like hanging. Can you hang? It's like a combination of being really relaxed and not willing to like, let somebody talk you down, you know what I mean? Teamwork is the dreamwork. Yeah, pull up to the next window. Oh, sick! Do that. Take her ticket and then pull up to the-yeah. Sorry, the first window's closed. Sorry about that. The guy he-he just got off. He's counting his money out. We're gonna get a hot tub next week, you should come by. - A hot tub? - Yeah. I'm in. Take it easy. Ah, fix that! Seriously. We're not an average parking lot. We're not oblivious to these things, you know? We realize this is uh... a rare thing, it's not even easy to get a job there. It's not like you can just get a job in the parking lot. People, when I first started working there, people would ask me how they got like how can I get this job? Like when are you guys hiring? I was just like, I never knew what to say, because it's like you can't. You can't get the job, it's impossible, you have to like befriend everyone in the parking lot, basically. Since I got a job there, I've kind of had a hand in uh, bringing in my friends into the parking lot. I got the job because of Brian Thackery. Tony Z, he got the job because of me. So it all goes, you know, down the line. Technically, yeah, I got the job through friend but so did probably everyone else. I got the job from Ben, who got my friend Grier the job. I got the job because my friend Jim Ralston was working there. I got the job through Nate. I got the job because I knew Maynard. Mostly through Louise Jones. I got the job through Bridge. Basically what Christian has kinda created there is fairly unique, as a place that allows people to kind of, slowly become who they are. It's just fifty cents afterwards. This wasn't just a job. It is a holy mission. We are going to park the car. We will park them on the beaches. We will park them on the hillsides. We will park them until there are none to be parked. The corner parking lot was definitely- and the people who worked there was definitely an outpost of the small army. The small army was ranked against the large army. The large army is everybody else. The large army is just like boring people. The small army is, you know, us freaks, whatever. Our friends. People were definitely seriously considering the existential implications of the job, which were what does it actually mean? Where does it fit in? Which is of course one of the problems of having an insanely overeducated group of people working at a service sector job is that they have plenty of time to think about it. It certainly had an element of the sacred. We were like the priests of the Mayan temple. If 600 times a day you are taking a ticket from somebody, you have 600 hundred opportunities to take a ticket from somebody with your full awareness and to really be present in that action. Despite the perspective of a parking lot attendant job as being the sort of the ultimate slack-job, I mean there's this whole kind of lifestyle, philosophical component to the parking lot. If you're looking to cultivate things like detachment and understand a Buddhist notion like impermanence, a parking lot's a perfect opportunity. You develop a strong sense of self and you get to know who you are fundamentally, in the absence of any other external trappings or anything that socially, people recognize, you know, that typically frame our identities and make who we are, you know I do this or I do that. Well, when you're at the parking lot, you do nothing. You literally sit there. And I guess I did grown in that regard too and that I really became comfortable with myself, beyond whatever society might have thought I was or what I supposed to be doing or where I was from, I mean I was the guy that sat there. I would usually get there... you know, pretty early, like around seven. Pop the lock, get out the gate and the wrench. Go over, put them on, turn on the machine. Once you kind of get everything up and running usually there is a period of relative calm where you don't have to really be hustling too much. But then when it started to get busier, we started to have a second guy come inn for lunch. So that guy would show up and we would hang out for a while and then you would all get lunch and sit around and you would deal with the busiest part of the day and then you'd start getting people for the night. You hang out for a while, probably after you clock out and just rap with the night guy. If you're the night guy you show up at five. And then there's kind of a lull. Then you're kind of in the weird zone where that's kind of where the evening can turn good or bad a lot of the time. Two o'clock, when the bars start to close, that's when you really kinda need to be out. Just being out and being presence stops so many problems from happening. Around, there o'clock, if it was like a busy bar at night, that would be the point where people would finally kind of stagger out and all get in their cars at once and leave. You'd have like the big flow of money. You would know that was the time to go before anything else really went down. Because at that point you're sitting out in a darkened parking lot, with a giant wad of money in your pocket and no one really around so that is when you kind of start to get a little antsy that it was time to get out of there. Then the night would be over and depending on how many violent interactions you had, you would go home and lie awake thinking about how much you hated those people and how stupid they were. Then eventually you would fall into a fitful, traveled sleep. I would say that's like half a point. Just like fifty cents is good. Flip-cone is the long standing game of the parking lot. I had a flip-cone court set up and everything. Whoo! I always wanted to make the flip-cone movie that only played flip-cone because they worked at parking lots. But they were able to challenge the kind of up-scaled flip-cone teams or gangs that gout out their aggression by playing flip-cone against each other. There's been good bowling movies. It's kind of the same idea. Like the loser sport. I don't think people that work at the corner parking lot, these masters degrees, these professors, these undergrad guys. I don't think they work or want to work at other parking lots. There's something different about the corner parking lot. Like for some reason the anthropology department was supplying parking lot attendance for a long, long time. Then it might be sociology, or the religion department was funneling people and then for a while you had some other guys that were from the philosophy department. So sometimes word gets out that it's a sweet gig. People that get too antsy are not good. People that are too Type A are not good. And that's why the anthropologists are great. Because it's like field work and they just sit here and kind of stare off in space. Philosophers, I have to admit, are... they're in another planet. The anthropologists, at least are, they might be in Africa, but at least they're on this planet. We would get these grad students and it was perfect for them because of course the job is, you know, long periods of tedium. Punctuated by brief moments of "Fuck you, buddy." Uhm, which graduate philosophy students need. No one's parents look down at the crib of their newborn child and says "God I wish my son or daughter grows up to be a parking lot attendant". Come on. I came back to Charlottesville for graduate school. And I needed a job and I was just on a whim was like "Uh, are you hiring?" The other thing is I had parking lot experience. So I knew what it meant to work in sparking lot, it meant you do nothing. And you get paid to do nothing and you just collect money. Honey! Oh, here she comes. So this is the parking lot, my hand's on the booth. I'm wearing a wool hat. And I have glasses on and I'm sporting a vest sweater. Sometimes you go to move these cars and you turn around and there will be really old lady in the back. Another little service I provide is I passive aggressively engage the emergency brake because they probably never use it and they might actually drive home before discovering that it's here. But I sight safety reasons but it's really just passive aggression. The cardboard is basically temporary wall, Without the cardboard, it would just be framing. The cardboard is the lazy man's, parking lot's version of a wall. It was funny because you'd sit around reading like a map or an atlas or a painting. Eventually it becomes like multi-layered skins of an onion. And it's just layer, upon layer and layer. You had to remove all these layers of cardboard. And instead of throwing them out, you had to take them to the office where you knew they were going to be kept and stored away like in a museum. Every time they did a clean up, they would remove this and then hang new ones. If you had a newspaper there, you could spend a whole shift cutting out little pictures and pasting them together with little, funny comments. But the one rule was the comments always had to deal with parking. You couldn't just be witty, somehow they had to relate in some sense to parking. There's probably nothing worse than poets working in parking lots. That's a dangerous mix. If anyone had any kind of philosophical thoughts or questions, you would write them on tickets. Am I my brother's parker? Nothin' at all but streets an' roads. Philosophy, Jack Kerouac, all that stuff just written right here. Religious flyers were always the favorite. Leave revenge to the corner parking lot. This movie was on this morning, Taxi Driver. Everyone identifies with alienated Travis Bickle. What a fun guy. There's always one point of a shift when you wish you had that little shoulder contraption that he wore, that would just flick out when he ran out of ammo. If you didn't have that feeling then you weren't really doing your job. So you park here and leave keys? Yes, please. Could you bring them to the booth. Could you bring the keys here? There's a lot of people who work at the parking lot, who I feel like at some point they were somebody's bitch or... They were the geek of like their school, revenge of the nerds. But it's a combination of like a punk rock kind of attitude and like a not caring attitude. I have absolutely no change, I didn't think- - She doesn't have any money? - No. I mean it's a paid parking lot. I understand that but I was in here for like five seconds. I don't really care. You have to care or else you're not gonna be good at the job because people, they expect us to care like as little as a fat suit employee would care. But it's not like that. It's just not like that. - Two dollars, please. - Two dollars? Man. Yeah, you know there's something we like to have here in effect. It's called highway robbery. I mean we do our best to maintain that at any point, Yeah, we practice in front of the mirror, actually. You wouldn't know but... Dude, that was so hot. - I'm into Russian chicks. - That was Russian. - I love Russian chicks. Don't drink, don't smoke, don't fuck. I'm outta step with the world. I think that job kind of confirmed for me that most people are crazy. And that I probably wasn't like most people. I was grateful that I had this really cool job and I worked for a nice guy and I appreciated both of those things, so... I wanted to excel as a parking lot attendant. I would listen to records all day long at that job. It allowed for personal... growth and development and introspection. A girl I knew from high school came through, argued with me about the forty cents and was really insulted that anyone would be trying to charge her forty cents for a service in which she had taken a ticket pulled into a parking lot with a gate and parked her car and then could then be asked to pay for that. I wouldn't let it go. I wanted to get paid. And finally she snapped at me and she's like, I know who you are. She's like I hope you're proud of yourself, now you're great, you're a parking lot attendant. I was like, yeah, I am proud. I love this job. I hope you're proud of yourself. Driving your father's car and trying to beat out a forty cent parking fee. Who's come further, me or you? And that was a nice day. Cause' she was a jerk and she was uhm-her father was a jerk. He was my sixth grade math teacher... He was a total jerk. Fuck that guy. I was twenty one when I started working there. At that point you might as well be an infant. For me, the time that I spent in the parking lot, that was when I grew up. It played an important part in my development as a human being, so... In that sense I was born to work there. I guess I don't know at what point I started parking at the parking lot more. And then John kept being at the parking lot. And John was giving me more free parking. And then one time, my car battery died in the parking lot. Which is an opportunity that every parking lot attendant waits for. And I might add that not only were you a good parker, actually able to park your car well, which is... one of the first things a parking lot attendant looks for in a potential partner, but uh also your car was very small, it was a Honda Civic. It wasn't so much about the parking, it was more so the metaphysical part of it, I guess. - The soul parking. - The soul parking, right, right. There were lots of discussion as to what could go on the gate. And that again was some sort of a ceremonial act, where they would get the paint together, they would get the empty board, get the little padding. They would put it all together, get their stencils out and make this thing, but there would be these reserves, these gates and it would be like what should go out today? And it's a new gate and of course there'd be these people that followed the gates, they'd come by and be like "Ah, man!" "New gate!" You know, It was like the fresh food arriving to the south pole or something. Freshies. There are a couple of different styles of gate making. I'm an old school purist. So, mine is a strictly letter oriented, it's black on white. And mostly they refer in some way to what's going on at that moment in the parking lot. They're not usually intended to really be understood by the parkers. It's sort of a temporary autonomous zone. These are people who are former celebrities. Who are now mostly sort of a footnote and occasionally they breeze past on some sort of television show and people are like "Oh yeah, it's that guy.", or in this case, that lady. Uhhh, one dollar. There and then another three for the- No, I've been here three hours. Two times three is six. Not nine. You've been here... - It's 4:35 right now, so that's 12:40, 1:40, 2:40... - No, no- - No, listen to me. - No, I'm not listening to you, I only owe you six dollars. No you don't, listen, it's- Listen, I come in here at eight o'clock in the morning and stay 'til one and they charge me five bucks. Well, that's not right. Do you know what time it is right now? - I do know what time it is. - What time is it? Tell me. It's four thirty seven. So you tell me how much time is in between 12:40 and 4:37. About 55 minute-about 3 hours and 55 minutes. Starting after forty minutes we charge... I don't want to argue with you. I want fourteen dollars back. - You owe me nine dollars. - No, I don't. If you want to leave without getting a ticket then you're- - Give me my money back. - Lady. Look at the sign. Why did you park here if you can't give me the money that you owe me? This is my job. This is how I make my money. I don't know what you do for a living but you owe me nine dollars right now, if you want to leave you know, you can drive away but I'm gonna write your license plate number down and then call the police. I don't care, it doesn't bother me, it's not- it's no skin off my back. Damn, you're the craziest lady I've ever had come through. Well then you have an extremely shallow life. Ahhh. This really brightened up my day. Don't forget to take your medication tomorrow! What kind of person would have enough money to buy a big car and put gas in it and not want to just pay? It's forty cents. What's wrong with you? And, uh... Yeah, it can really... send your mind spinning, if you, if uh... If you're looking for a... that void, it is there to welcome you with open arms. Into it, uhm... It could be a real-a real- a really existential job in that way. Once that gate goes up and a car comes in people apparently enter this no man's land of a place where civic order and rules cease to apply. People tend to lose a sense or perspective and self. And they feel very entitled to park. For me, the thing that made me angry was generally that it was rich, entitled people coming and wanting to exploit you because you were of a lower socioeconomic class. This were a smug entitlement really started to make my blood boil. The mid-life crisis guys. They were the second worst, behind the frat-boy, sorority sister types. Because they would have some expensive car and think they were all hot shit. While they're going bald and you know, there life is pretty much going nowhere. Other than, you know, they got some money. Enough to think that they can be a dick to people without any repercussions. I hated people like that. Closed parking is an inalienable right of every car owning citizen. And we get paid for it, like we're scalpers, we're criminals for charging. We gotta pay? Yeah, yeah you do, uhm... Well, what's that about? I could explain the entires system of capitalism right now to you but... you're sub-human and there's a line of cars there, so... it's seventy five cents and... and good luck good luck with that friendship bracelet you're making. While you're driving. So, it's about the social contract really, especially if you're a guy working at a parking lot and you're talking to someone who's in a 50,000 dollar Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer and they're getting in your grills bout fifty cents. Even though to them it seems completely plausible that fifty cents shouldn't even really matter to you. To you that fifty cents is worth 50,00 dollars of Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer and you just want to take it out of them anyway you can. That cone's there for a reason. You can't park there. God damn, moving my cones. Twice people have moved my cone. That's a nice family example, that dad moving it for his family. The most extreme example of people's sense of entitlement and their fundamental laziness, their lack of engagement with their environment, you know? This is sort of idea that it's unfair for you to expect me to drive around and look for a spot in the street. But it's also unfair of you to expect me to pay for this spot. I don't think we have anything, ma'am. - You can try the garage over there. - Okay, thanks ma'am. Oh, God. This lady just blocked in about six cars. I mean that's like the worst-over the last twenty years that's the absolute change is SUV's. So we're supposed to get rid of the spaces so we can accommodate all these SUV's. So we'd have less parking because everybody's driving something that's like a tank. All of a sudden cars are getting bigger and getting bigger. And bigger and just when you thought they were gonna get bigger, they got bigger and then they got bigger. You have the Ford Explorer. That wasn't big enough, so they had the Ford Expedition, which was the biggest vehicle on the road. And that wasn't big enough, they have the Ford Excursion, which was monster of a car. Oh, then on top of it the Hummer stated to appear. And a lot of us would categorically not park them, you know you're not on duty in Iraq. You don't need tires that don't have air in them because if you take shrapnel rounds or if mortars or grenades go off, I mean what the-what is that? Can't pu-it's too big, we cannot see literally the whole parking lot, okay? We just can't, it's too big. Suddenly at three o'clock, the parking lot was filled with Suburbans. They're there with there car, they're not thinking about you as a person. They're like "I got mine, fuck you." So, there was just no room for them. I'd say, "I'm sorry, there's no room for you to park your car in this lot." "Maybe you can find room to park on the street, but I doubt it." Like you can almost see the truncated still images in their head. Like, I bought the car, how could there not be a place to park it? Surely it comes with a parking space. We got the give me convenience or give me death mentality going on right now. Alright, fucking Lynyrd Skynyrd, ow! People are just like so beholden to their car and you know, we all kinda look at them as like, I mean most of us ride bikes. Around eleven o'clock that's usually when the first person, the first like drunken like college kid comes over there to the train tracks, whooping at something. Then it's like a flood gate open up of like drunken hooligans. Stupidity and just alcohol I think were big variables. I mean they would crawl, a lot of them would be crawling. I think that's where a lot of the mess in the parking lot, the vomit and everything else would end up. When there's the potential for craziness out here, I always try to kind of be on the offensive. And during really busy night, you kind of must make your presence known in the lot. Because it tends to prevent things from happening. People think they're being watched tend to be a little bit more civil than they would be otherwise. You constantly had to make sure everybody at least abided by certain ground rules because there's a lot going on. Yeah, there's no double parking. No double parking. Many stories, police wise. Two DUI arrests with the same vehicle. People's cars were shot up. He actually went airborne over the gate and flipped the car up on its rooftop. Literally, under the lights, having sex, right there in the backs of their cars. Never a dull moment. It's like, it was like watching the migration of jellyfish. Like boneless buffalo. All trying to leave. Through one exit. Uhm, I need a dollar fifty. Can you add it to my tab? - Does your friend have a dollar fifty? - No. I go everywhere on credit. To work there you have to have a certain disregard for the people. Because otherwise you could fixate on the fact that you being at a fairly good school, you have to imagine that maybe eighty percent of those people will graduate. And all the people who graduate, for the most part are going to make more money in a year than I will in my entire life. Not only that, many of them are going to be sending my children to wars on other planets. And not only that, but they all just vomited on a Buick. It's like, you know what, maybe you shouldn't have bought your kid that Range Rover. Maybe you should have just thought about it a little while. Because we see why your kid's a bastard. You know, he's not nice. They're not nice people. Yeah, they'll make a lot of money, you know but whatever. It's alumni are the kind of most obnoxious and they're sort of like "Oh, good luck with your life." You don't know what my life's about, just because you see me at my job, doesn't mean you know what my life's about. Graduation day, having like a car. Dad driving the car and the whole family is in the car. And him saying, I kid you not, saying "You know, if you got a college degree, you wouldn't have to do a job like this." You must be feeling pretty good about you're son's graduation to have totally lost touch with any element of social behavior. I hated sorority girls, they were the worst. Second worst were frat boys, they think the world owes them everything. Like they got an incredible sense of entitlement because they're in a fraternity or a sorority. - It's two dollars. - Two bucks? - Yeah. Fucking expensive shit, dude, wow. You guys take traveler's checks? - Uhm, no, we just take cash or personal checks. - Sex? Sometimes. Hello. You should smile. It's kind of like being in a zoo. You don't know if you're in the cage, or if... they're in the cage... or where the zoo is really. That was one of my former students. That's always very awkward for me here. Because it's been a few years since I've seen her and she pretended like she didn't know who I was but I know she did because there was a certain moment of acknowledgment. When I see my former students and they see me in this de-exhorted position. For me there's this type of gallantarianism out here in the lot. We're all human beings and we're all deserving of a certain amount of human basic respect and human dignity. When I don't see that coming from people out here, it kind of pisses me off. Sons of bitches, ah fuck! Damnit. On an average Friday or Saturday night, the gate might get broken one time. On a bad night it would get broken twice. On a terrible, awful night it would get broken three times. It's like someone hitting a home run or something. Just like this snap. At around 12:30 I would turn off the music, I'd be outside the booth and I'd be waiting. You can't see the gate, but you can hear it. Be waiting to hear the crack of the gate. So I can immediately take off and find out who broke the gate. I tried. If they'd be given the option, they can either get arrested for vandalism, possibly go to jail, or they could pay the piper, And they usually decided to pay for their restitution to the parking lot attendant on the scene. You broke our gate, it's 35 dollars, or I call the cops. If I break the gate and I pay for it, do I get to keep it, since I paid for it? No, you don't get to keep the gate. It's a work of art. It belongs to us, it's ours. I caught somebody breaking the gate last night. Oh really? Yeah, I got him by the collar. My voice drops an octave. Oh, yeah, 20 dollars. No no no, it goes the other way. 20 dollars. Gimme the 20 dollars. But there's such a satisfaction in getting 20 dollars out of someone who's broken the gate. And it's not just-you know, it's not petty, it's not revenge. It's restoring order to a chaotic world. Then you come up to the lonely looking grad guy in the little booth at night that's lit with like a 60 watt yellow bulb. You know, guys realize that the balance of power's in their favor. There was no exit thing. Nothing prevented people from just simply leaving. I mean, it becomes a thing about the social contract. It's very Lockian. You know, you're asking, "Would you please pay for this convenience we've offered you?" Hey hey hey! Gimme your ticket. Come on, it's a pay lot. Gimme your ticket. Then when people would drive out without paying, the switch would flip, then it was just total bloodlust. The next thing you'd know I would end up out in the middle of the street, hanging on to some guy's shirt. You get the license plate? ZWG somethin'. Hey hey hey! I got it! I got it! So, there was the beeping penalty. If you beeped while the person ahead of you was paying, then you paid double. I didn't tell people about the beeping penalty, I would just look at their ticket, determine what the price was and double that. I did not pocket the money, I put it in the till. I did not overcharge people just so I could get more money, I overcharged people because they were dicks and they deserved it. Um... Vengeance is mine. So I'm trying to smash his head into his steering wheel, as the car accelerates. I've been kind of twisted down like that. So my shoulder is kind of like, potentially being, you know, pulled out of its socket. And so I'm trying to slam his head into the steering wheel. That was the moment when I realized that maybe I had to... adopt a different approach. They were at the end of the alley, I hocked the wrench, it flew at a straight angle. It hit and blew the mirror up, almost like a pistol shot it hit it. So no doubt, this car was freaking out. And no doubt the car belonged to Mommy or Daddy, and they were gonna have some 'splaining to do in the morning. It was my first throw and it was kind of addicted. At one point I actually hung on to a Jeep as it pulled into Main Street, the guy laughing at me and flicking me off. He owed me like two dollars. I mean, can you imagine? You know, I'm like... you know, about to break every bone in my body for two dollars. But you get like that. I've thrown a lot of stuff at cars. But the difference was, I was in my mid thirties. And that's one of those times where you look in the mirror, and you're like, "You know, Harper, You're almost 40... and you're throwing rocks at cars, and you're in the parking lot, something isn't right here." What? Did you just call him an idiot? That was a classic exchange. She called you an idiot out loud. - Who? - That girl. - What'd she say? - She was like, "Idiot." - Fuck off, no she didn't. - Yes she did. And I was like, "Did you just call him an idiot?" and she like wouldn't look over. You parked for 10 minutes. That bitch just fuckin' called me an idiot? - She did out loud. - No fucking way. - Patrick, let it go, buddy. - No! I called her on it, buddy. I called her on it and she left. There's a part of your brain that's telling' ya, "For God's sakes man, stop." You're like an action junky, you know, you can't stop yourself, but this time, the guy's left the booth, and he's kickin' ass and he's angry. He's a parking lot attendant out of control. I think it's an obsession. It becomes your life... to work at a parking lot, and like... it's more than a parking lot. The way it's set up, it's like you're not just taking money, it fuels some sort of-like you're in some sort of... battle with humanity or something. It's a power struggle. I dunno. 'Cause you're really- you're just a parking lot attendant, but... if people weren't lame, and you didn't get to complain a lot, then like, you would just be a parking lot attendant, but in this way you get to be some sort of, like, arbiter of like humanity taste and like... you get to decide who's good and who's bad... people. Usually based on just their parking habits, and what kind of cars they drive. Have a good night. I hate people when they interact with parking lot attendants and people in, like, jobs like that. I think their habits towards that are bad. I think that they don't recognize you. Constantly people just won't say a word to me throughout that entire interaction, you know. They're paying their parking and I'm saying, "How are you?" you know, "Have a good day, thanks a lot." stuff like that. The opportunity to uh... to judge someone by their car, before they got out of it became pretty easy. The amount of Prius-centered vanity plates is unreal. And every time they give you their keys, it's like, "Hello, I'm driving the Prius, license plate My Prius. It's the Prius over there. Do you know how to drive a Prius?" And it's just like, yeah, I get it. I know how to drive the damn Prius. We always talk about the various people that are often bad parkers. For some reason law students, very bad parkers. I don't know what it is, but Lexus definitely suck. Like, Land Rovers always suck. This guy parked a Ferrari in the lot, and this was a one of a kind thing. And it was an automatic transmission and I was so, so offended by that. I was like, "This is what's wrong with the world. You got a sports car with automatic transmission." I mean most of the people that work there, uh... got to know a lot about cars, and got to know makes and models, and had very efficient memories when it came to recalling the exact make, model. Yeah, those guys were good. Sam's got that blue Dodge. It was like a green Mazda. '66 maybe? I think it's a Taurus, but it's a little bit smaller. It might actually be like, a Geo Metro. Laura drives a black Nissan SUV. It's not a Tahoe, I guess it's a Suburban, license plate DAMARI. It's like a blue Ford. It's not a Saab, it looks like a Saab. Silver BMW. Green VW Golf. Green Subaru Legacy. Black Nissan Sentra. Maroon Mitsubishi, with a bunch of, like, pro-hemp stickers on the back. You start paying attention to... uh... you know, to the license plates, and the makes and models of cars. And it becomes... you know, it can become an obsession. It was a blue Xterra with North Carolina plates. It's like, "Oh, man" you know, "YGW2243, that guy owes us 10 dollars and 50 cents." There'd be the list of the people that drove out. Like, we would all write down their license plates, because we were frustrated, angry and resentful, but we thought one day God will shine His- His light of justice down and hand us the sword to fucking tow them when they're dumb enough to park in here again. A great moment for my sanity was when Virginia changed to a seven digit license plate. Because when Virginia had the six digit license plate, I had a photographic memory for license plates. I could remember the license plate of every person who'd ever driven out on me, owed me money. When they went to seven digits, I just couldn't remember anymore. You pay for the night. That's all, you're pre-paying for the night. Chill out, dude. I don't care if you're yelling at me. - What do you want... - Relax, you relax. I'm asking you guys a simple question. Here's the deal. Here's the thing, man. When you-yeah, okay. When you pre-pay... When you pre-pay at night, like a five o'clock... I hate everybody that parks there equally. I think everybody is a dick. Or an asshole. I think that... people that park crooked fucking suck, and I think people that, like, don't wanna pull all the way into the parking spot suck. The people that suck the worst are the people that pull up to the gate and don't realize that you have to press the button on the fucking machine to get a ticket. Those people fuckin' suck. The people that drive out and don't know that it's a pay lot. The people that say, "Uh, you guys should put a sign out." when there's a big fuckin' sign in the back of the parking lot. Those people suck. People that fuckin'- People say, "Hey. Where it says No Parking, can I park there?" Those people are fuckin' morons! I think at some point every day you experience a little burn out at that job. You would just... you know... in that exasperated, you know... Fucking people! Oh, so last night I was dreaming, and... I'm just takin' tickets from random people, just like, working the booth. It's like I never went home! It's like I just stayed here. I woke up, and... So I was here last night, I just dreamt about being at the lot all night, had to work today. So it's just kinda... inescapable. It kind of gets to the point where they can't- they can't get the joy out of it anymore. And it's only just this kind of grudge match against, you know, the world, and the parkers. That's what happened to the lost generations, the Fitzgeralds, everyone like that, you know. That's what happened to Twain, you know. It's really, you know, this despair sets in, you know. I'm going-I'm currently going insane from working there. But like, everybody recognizes that there's like a point where people start going crazy from working there. I've gotta get out. I gotta get out before I go totally crazy. There are plenty of people that have taken it too far, and that usually means... it might be time for them to go, or they need to work a little less, or they need a vacation. You know, so they can get a proper balance, and realize it is just a parking lot. You know, it should be a little more enjoyable than that. You kind of get to the point, then, when you sort of see yourself as sort of a all-powerful creator, destroyer god. You know, who can control all the aspects of the cosmos. There becomes a point where it's counter-productive, and you're just kind of getting into this punitive, watered-down notion of justice, which is just punishing people. When you know it's time for you to move on, then you have to follow that, and get on with whatever the next thing is that you're supposed to be doing. Eventually you kind of come around, hopefully, and realize that it's not all about you. You know, like, ultimately the greatest thing you can get out of it. I mean that's where you have to get away from these sort of... attendant as creator, destroyer god way of thinking. It's not up to you to make sure that that person gets their just desserts. You start to have, like, a slightly more nuanced sense of cause and effect. It's best to go ahead and let that person go down the road because you're not the one responsible for meting out the effect. That's a mechanism of the universe. And there's always a point it seems like no matter how long people work there, they reach the end of their time, where they know it's time to move on. Because you don't plan on making a career out of it. And some people have come pretty close. And you even start wondering' if they're gonna be there long enough to get a pension or a gold watch or somethin'. I worked at the parking lot for 11 years. This was the watch that was presented to me upon my retirement from the Corner Parking Lot. It says "So sorry, $6.00". That was back when 6 dollars was... the all-day rate. Well I mean, it kind of taught me how to be... a human being. I think to work in the parking lot you had to be some sort of romantic, although a devious one. I think we're all sort of deviant romantics. And whatever we do it doesn't seem to amount to nearly the sort of potential that we seem to have held in the parking lot. In the parking lot we were dynamos, whirlwinds, you know, we were rulers. We had complete autonomy. You know we... We had it all in a world that had nothing to offer us. For so many of these guys it's after school so it's at this point where they really don't know what's next, you know, and they're trying to figure it out, or not. Or just trying to hold on before they have to. It is just a parking lot, it's important to remember that. You know. Those guys sometimes forget it. But, you know, the fervor of 20 year olds, or 25 year olds, or 30 year olds, is a little bit different, you know, it's not as temperate yet. For me, I feel like I have much more of a, like, live and let live. You try and people do what they want, and there's not that much you can do about it anyway, so why drive yourself crazy worrying about it. Just count the money at the end and hope it pays the bills. But it's not just a parking lot. It's people that have worked here, and it's time for me that has passed in my life. The cast of characters have changed, but the phenomena hasn't. You know, I'm the one person that's still there. All the other guys, this is just a stop for them. Some more significant than others, in terms of their stops, but ultimately just a stop. Did we play god? I guess that's the question. Did we play god in the parking lot? And well, none of us could ever be god, but... I guess we played god. I didn't drive out without paying! It's like, "Well, this car did." because I wrote down the license plate number. Oh, it was one of my sorority sisters probably, I loan my car out. I said, "Well you should be careful about who you loan your car to." You know, people say that the rest of your life is gonna be, is-is basically high school. I think I was lucky enough that, um... in a lot of ways the parking lot was more what the rest of my life was gonna be like, and that's better. There really no chance that I'm gonna go upside somebody's head with a lead pipe at work. No, well there's not really any opportunities to do that. - There's no lead pipe. - There's no lead pipes. Yeah. These are some mean streets. These are some preppy mean streets. A lot of popped collars and pink and green here. You gotta be careful. I don't know... fuck people that drive cars. I drive a car. I drove a big car most of the time. Gas guzzler, but man, fuck people in SUVs. Working at the parking lot, I realized that everyone is crazy. I don't see how you can work here and not just realize that everyone is completely out to lunch. I changed the S to a B, and so it said "Endless Bummer". And then my mom's friend apparently came into the house the other day, And she was like, "Endless bummer" she was like, "That's so sad, why is that up here?" I wore this shirt, like, probably four times out of the week. Keys, machine, the booth, cones, a car, you know. Four dollars, please. The occasion is that this job rocks. I rock, I rock. In the classroom you get this hierarchical ordering thing. There's like, you, the instructor, then the students. Out here in the parking lot it's much, much different. So you're sitting there in a decontextualized, neutral environment, with no real meaning, no real structure, no real organizational framework that gave you any sort of direction, and at the end of the day, the best way to approach that was to become a transcendental existentialist, and really not look for that meaning. We're cool like... uh... we're cool like The Situationists were cool, only, like, with less, you know, activity. It was just kinda like... sticking it to that man, or something, like, "We're still here. You didn't get rid of us and now we're charging you money." And that's-that's pretty much it. I mean, I guess I have been the boss, but there's been a much greater level of... of... friendship and communication, and affection and love for a lot of these people. 'Cause these people are really wonderful people, and I feel pretty lucky to have experienced 'em, but I also really enjoyed, and I hope, you know, I kinda hope they feel somewhat similar. That they look back and it is a bit of a smile. You know, and... you know, what else can you ask for? How's it going tonight? It's, uh, one dollar. Here you go. - Thanks. - Have a good one.
