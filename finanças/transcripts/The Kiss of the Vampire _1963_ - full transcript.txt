I suppose he's been drinking again. He's coming here. What did you say? I said, I think we need some petrol! As I was saying, I think we need some pet... I'm sorry, it was my fault, darling. These roads twist so it's impossible to follow them. It's not your fault. I should have dipped the tanker way back. Bone dry. I'll search around to see if I can get some help, I'm afraid. - Someone to tow us. - Shall I come with you? No, it'll be quicker if I go alone. All right. Now, you stay in the car. You'll be quite safe. Gerald? Try not to be long. I'll try. Stop running! Go back to your car! - You hear me? - Yes! Go back to your car! Go! Gerald, I was so frightened! Oh, don't leave it there. Someone may want to come in. - They won't, sir. - Won't they? No one ever comes here now, sir. Why not? Why not? Goodnight, sir. Well, what do you think, Gerald? Well... I... We'd better get under shelter! Why can't you leave us alone? We wondered if you might have a room! A room? You want a room? Yes. For the night. Wondered... You're strangers then, huh? Well, yes. Please, come in, come in. Come in, please. Come in. Oh, you're wet! Oh, come in and dry yourselves, please. Anna! Anna, we have people, um, guests! Come quickly! Oh, excuse me. What a night! What a night! - Left your horses outside? - We came by motorcar. Motorcar? Oh, you must be very rich, young man. It's my father's car. We borrowed it for our... - ...journey. - Oh, so. Oh, Anna... Anna, look, we have guests! Would you show these good people a room while I get their luggage, hm? I'll get your luggage. Oh, please, you'll get soaked! Wait until the rain stops! Oh, I have an umbrella. Will you sign here, please? What room do you want? I beg your pardon? Which room? They are all vacant. All ex... except one. Well, nothing too expensive. We still have a long way to travel. Five marks? Yes, that'll be fine. It is the best we have. This way. I will bring you fresh linen and hot water. Is there anything else you require? Some tea, perhaps? Certainly. My husband will lay a fire for you. Just as soon as he returns with your luggage. Well? Anna! Anna, look! Look, see! Look! Well? Well, Anna, don't you see? This is rice! I found it among their luggage! Anna, don't you see what this means? They're just married! This is their honeymoon! Oh, Anna, look, we must do everything we can... ...to make them comfortable, eh? I am fetching them hot water now. What more can I do? Oh, Anna... Anna, try to forget. Please. Just for tonight. For their sakes. Please. - Tea, darling! - Shan't be a moment. That looks good. Now, wait. Hello! We've got company. What is it? Someone has just delivered a letter. Somebody pretty important too, by the look of the carriage. - Oh! - What? - Come here. - What's wrong? It's your ear. Stop it, darling. The tea will get cold, darling. I know. Come in! - A letter for you, sir. - For me? But that's impossible. Oh, no, it's addressed to you, the English gentleman, the Grand Hotel. - Eh, that's us. - But who can it be from? - Ravna. - Yes... ...that's the Herr Dr. Ravna. Oh, very fine gentleman. He has lived at the chateaux now for some years. Is that the one we saw on the mountain back there? Yes, Madame. He wants us to have dinner with him! - What? - Well, that's what it says. "I should like to offer you my sympathy... ...and extend an invitation to dine with me tonight. You'll find the food at the hotel at..." Well, I'll skip that bit. My wife is a good woman, but a cook? "My carriage will call at 8:00 which I trust will be convenient." Well, what do you say? I... I haven't anything to wear. Oh, he's forestalled you there... "Come just as you are. We shall not be formal." I think we should go! Oh, you should go, Madame. The Herr Doctor is a very charming gentleman... ...and his table is one of the best in the country. It'll be an experience for you, Madame. Very well. Good evening. Dr. Ravna is expecting us. - More surprises. - Pleasant ones, I hope. You expected the inside of my house... ...to be as unattractive as the outside? - Is that it? - Well... If it were, I could not live here. I like only to be surrounded by beautiful... ...things. And as I am fortunate enough... ...to have the means to satisfy my wish... But there I go. Please excuse my appalling manners. We have so little company here... ...that I sometimes forget how to behave. My name is Ravna. Gerald Harcourt, and my wife Marianne. Welcome to my house. It was very kind of you to invite us. It was indeed. I still can't quite understand... ...how you found out about us so quickly! To tell the truth, I was spying on your motorcar. Such things are a rarity in these parts, and when I heard the sound, I used my telescope... - ...to watch you drive by. - Oh, we didn't. - We broke down. - No, that is true. And before I could do anything to assist you, you had taken the initiative yourself, Mr. Harcourt. Now, please... come and meet the rest of my family. Oh, that was beautiful! Thank you, Madame. And now, may I introduce my children to you. - My daughter, Sabena... - How do you do? - ...and Carl, my son. - How do you do? - Mr. and Mrs. Harcourt. - How do you do? Will you play some more for us? Later, I think, Carl. After dinner. Why have you not been to see us, my sweet? Why have you waited so long? You must know how much we've missed you. You should not be lying here all alone. A few years ago I conducted a series of scientific experiments, one of which went... wrong. I was to blame, of course. I'd made a mistake. Scientists sometimes do. Anyway, that is why I can... ...never return to the city of my birth, why I live here, locked in this ornate... coffin. Oh, but it's beautiful here. It often happens in life... ...that the most beautiful things are made from the most... ...unpromising of materials, don't you find? That wine we enjoyed at dinner... - You did enjoy it, I hope? - It was delicious! ...made from grapes trampled by the feet of a peasant. Dirty feet, as like as not. - Father! - Well, it's true, isn't it? That pheasant we ate, it had been hanging for five... Father, please! Perhaps Mrs. Harcourt would like to hear you play, Carl. Oh, please! Something of your own, perhaps... Carl? Certainly, Father. Oh, something you've composed yourself? How exciting! Thank you. You have a singularly lovely wife, Mr. Harcourt. Thank you. Marianne, are you feeling all right? - Please don't stop. - Father? No more now, Carl. I'm sorry. I thought... Marianne... ...I thought you were going to faint! - Perhaps it's too warm in here. - Oh, no, it's not that. It's just that she's had rather a long day. I think... - ...if you'll excuse us... - Of course. Sabena, will you ring for the carriage? Yes, Father. You will play for me again, won't you? It will be my pleasure, Madame. - Goodnight, Carl. - Goodnight. What are you going to do about your motorcar, Mr. Harcourt? Well, we need petrol. We'd planned to get to Kronenberg tonight. I know they keep a supply there. But that's 30 miles away, and across the mountains too. You were off your track. My wife is not a very good map reader, I'm afraid. If you don't mind staying at the hotel for another day or so, I'll gladly send over for your petrol for you. - Thank you very much, sir. - Not at all. I'd invite you to stay here, only I'm expecting... - ...a number of guests. - Oh, no. The hotel will be fine, thank you, sir. The food isn't that bad. It was a wonderful evening. I shall never forget it. - Why did you let her go? - They can't escape. Their motor has broken down. No petrol. That's right. They can't leave until I say so. Who's that? Must be your other guests. Oh, yes. Well, wasn't I right? You're glad you went, yes? Very, thank you. And the food was good, yes? You were quite right. It was absolutely excellent. Ah, yes. And the Herr Dr. Ravna, charming, no? Landlord! Brandy! - Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Mrs. Harcourt. - Goodnight. Brandy! Landlord! Brandy! ...two... three... Another terrible day! ...four... Is it? ...five... Will you ever forgive me for losing... - ...the way? - ...six! I might, I'll see. Now... Thank you. Please. Well... Oh, I'm sorry but the door was open. Anna and I wondered whether you'd care... ...to have breakfast with us. We'd open the dining room, of course, but it's a bit damp. We'd rather eat with you, wouldn't we? Much rather. Oh, in... five or ten minutes then, hm? In ten minutes we'll be there. Or fifteen. Anna... ...you've laid an extra place again. Oh, my dear, I've told you so many times. - Oh, good morning again! Come in! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Please, come in. Oh, is our fellow guest joining us for breakfast? Uh... Oh, no. No, no. He never eats. - How does he live then? - On brandy and sour cream. Yes, yes, I agree, but... This weather won't do your business much good. Business is never any good. Surely, the magnificent views... ...you must get from here in good weather? The road is... not much used by travellers. I expect your bar is well patronised in the evenings, though, by the local people, the farmers. - It used to be. - Nobody comes here now. Oh? Why is that? Oh, some bread, Madame? Thank you. Oh, you frightened the life out of me! Here, look at this! "Tania, aged 14." She's awfully like Anna, isn't she? Why does she hide it away? Why does she lay a place for someone who never eats? That'll be our fellow lodger. I think I'll have a word with him. Good morning! - Herr Zimmer isn't it? - Professor Zimmer! My name's Harcourt. We're fellow guests. - When are you leaving? - In a day or two when we... Good! Why do you want us out of the way? Look, what's all the mystery? - What mystery? - With this hotel! Why does no one ever come here? Excuse me, I have work to do. Please! I'm only asking for information. I advise you to ask no questions of anyone in this region. Well, that puts me in my place. Carl! How nice to see you. Is your sister with you? Yes, she's in the coach but we can't stay. Oh, but you must! I know Marianne will be delighted to see you. I'll call her. We can't stay long. Look, the weather's changing. Marianne, come and look who's here! Come in, come in! Now, let me offer you some refreshment. - Sabena! This is a lovely surprise! - I'll call the landlord. I don't suppose he has any champagne. No, please, we haven't time. I bring news of the petrol for your motorcar. My father has confirmed that there is a supply in Kronenberg. - Oh, excellent! - It will take a little time. We had to send an oxcart for it. They are not so fast... - ...as motorcars. - But more reliable. It will not be here till Sunday, I'm afraid. In the meantime, my father asks if you'll do him the honour... ...of attending a party he is giving on Saturday night. - Oh, well... - Please say you'll come. There'll be music! - And dancing. - It'll be a good party. - Please say yes! - Won't it be very formal? I know exactly what she's going to say: "I haven't got a thing to wear." And in this case it applies to me too. If you'll not consider it impertinent of me to offer, I have a dress suit I could lend you, Gerald. And I have the most heavenly dress. It's red chiffon and lace. And I'll send you my red velvet cloak to match. Oh, it'd look wonderful on you, Marianne! Oh, please, say yes. Then... yes. Oh, I'm so glad! But I'm coming too. Tell us some more about the party. Well, a chef is coming from Paris just to prepare the buffet. - Oh, how wonderful! - And an orchestra... ...is coming from Vienna. Good morning. The weather seems to be improving. It's getting a little brighter, I think. Please excuse us! Drive on! Drive like the devil! - Well, how is it, Bruno? - Oh, perfect, sir, perfect, but... ...one little touch. Thank you, Bruno. Now, who's that handsome man? - Darling! - Is that all? I'm speechless. - You look terrific! - Thank you. Oh, Madame, may I add my congratulations. - You look enchanting! - Thank you, Bruno. - It fits perfectly. - But that's thanks to Anna. She's worked wonders. Thank you, Anna dear. Anna! You're crying! Oh, my child! Would you care for a drink, sir, in... in... in the bar? Oh! Good idea, Bruno. Anna, did you once have a daughter of your own? Why do you say that? It isn't true! Why do you say it? I'm sorry, I... I only... That will be the carriage, Madame. You look marvellous, darling. Madame! Madame, I beg of you, be careful. What are you talking about? In God's name, be careful. What do you think he meant, Gerald? Don't worry, darling, he's been drinking. Marianne, let me look at you! Oh, it fits perfectly, and looks enchanting! Welcome to you both. Carl! I've sent for your masks, though in your case, Marianne, it would be a desecration. But in mine, an improvement. Is that what you mean? You know I did not mean that. Will you... permit me? I think it is an improvement. Now, would you care for some champagne... - ...or would you like to dance? - Oh, I'd love to dance. Oh, champagne for me. In that case, may I? - Carl, I really must have a rest. - More champagne? I couldn't. I feel quite dizzy as it is. I wonder where Gerald is. You're hungry, I expect. Let me get you some supper. - No, I really must find Gerald. - I'll find him for you. Would you see that Mrs. Harcourt gets some supper. I won't be a moment. Gerald! Gerald, where are we going? Gerald, is this a joke? What is it? I don't believe you are Gerald. Carl! One for Marianne... - Where is she, by the way? - I don't know. Maybe she's in the bar with that brother of yours. Come on! Where else you think she could be, Sabena? Perhaps she's gone to... powder her nose! Ah! You women! "Gone to powder her nose." Why not have another glass of champagne, Gerald? An extraordinary good idea. Please fetch a special glass of champagne for my friend. "A special glass." That sounds good. What about a special glass for you, mm? Later. To us all! Delicious! Ah! Perhaps Marianne went outside. I don't... I don't feel very well. Perhaps you've had a little... ...too much to drink. A little? - Feels like a lot. - Come upstairs... ...and have a rest. You'll feel better after. Look here, you're not trying to lead me astray, are you? I'm a respectable married man. Is that your room? Very pretty. After you. Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce a new disciple. What's happened to the party? Marianne! Carl! Thank goodness! What do you want? What do I want? What do you mean, what do I want? I want Marianne! I don't know what you're talking about. Look... if this is a joke... I'm... - ...I'm terribly sorry... - This is no joke. You come here, get drunk, have to sleep it off, and now you say you want someone called Marianne. Well, I do want her! She's my... What do you mean, "someone called Marianne?" You know who she is. I do not know. What? You came here alone. And you can leave that way. - I came here alone? - Precisely! And we're beginning to regret that we ever invited you! Hans, show this gentleman out... - ...will you? - Yes, sir. You saw me come here with my wife, didn't you? The lady with the red dress and the red cloak! Well, you opened the door for us! You came alone, sir. But... Carl? What's all this about? Hans! You keep away from here... or we'll set the dogs on you! Marianne? Bruno! Bruno! Bruno! My wife, has she come back? What... wife, sir? My wife, you old fool! Now, you know what I'm talking about! Don't, sir! Who do you think all these clothes belong to then? What have you done with them? What have you done with her things? Good God! I understand you wish me to issue a warrant, sir. - Is that correct? - Yes. Against Herr Dr. Ravna and his family, of the Chateau Ravna? Yes. The most important residence in the district. No doubt. You realise, sir, that Herr Dr. Ravna... ...is the most respected of gentlemen? What has that got to do with it? It has a great deal to do with it, young sir. You arrive here, a stranger, a foreigner, in fact. You are here for less than a week... ...when you start accusing one of our leading citizens... ...of abducting the lady you say is your wife. She is my wife. The landlord says you came here alone, sir. I have it here. Oh, what does his wife say? She is a strange woman, sir. She refuses to say anything. I think she's a little... Look, I didn't come here alone. I came here with Mrs. Harcourt, my wife. Can you prove that, sir? I mean, for instance, where are her personal belongings, her clothes? - They've disappeared. - Disappeared, sir? Yes, disappeared! Or stolen, if you like! So you wish me to make out a warrant against the thieves, sir. No, I don't. I only want... The register! There's nothing there, sir. Professor Zimmer, please help me! My wife, she's disappeared! I know, she's being kept in the chateau. Thank God! Thank God you know where she is! Are you a religious man? Not very. Do you believe in God? - Yes. - And the devil? Not the horn-headed, long-tailed devil in the picture books, I mean... ...the real devil. The force of fundamental evil. He exists, you know. Well, I... I suppose he does. I... I'd never really thought about it. The corruption of human beings by the devil can take many forms. Some of them so foul as to be beyond human belief. But because they are beyond belief doesn't mean they don't exist. Do you know what a vampire is? Yes. I've heard of vampire bats. Not bats. Vampires. Human vampires. Beings who exist on the blood of other humans. When the devil attacks a man or woman, with this foul disease of the vampire, the unfortunate human being can do one of two things: Either he can seek God through the church, and pray for absolution, or he can persuade himself that his filthy perversion... ...is some kind of new and wonderful experience... ...to be shared by the favoured few. Then he tries to persuade others to join his new cult! I had a daughter. She was all I had in the world. I idolised her. When she was very young, she ran away from home. Ran away to the city. She drifted in with a so-called smart set, and finally she was living with a certain man. She came home eventually. What was left of her came home. She was riddled with disease... ...and she was a vampire. They even tried to follow her beyond the grave. Thank God I was in time. Her soul now rests in peace. The name of the man who corrupted my daughter... ...was Ravna. My God! And Marianne is with him! - I must go there! - No! - No! Not now! - Yes, now! Now! No, no! Come here! Look! Look! The sun! The one thing a vampire can't tolerate. Now, your wife is safe until nightfall! And then, I shall do what I have to do. You, my friend, will remain here. - What did you... - I... I... I'll give you a drug. It'll make you sleep. Help to bring back your strength. You will need it before the night is out. Zimmer! Tania... ...please, listen to me. I need help and I think you can help me. Your name is Tania, isn't it? And your father is Herr Bruno, isn't he? Tania, my wife is here somewhere. They've taken her too. Do you know where she is? Yes. Will you take me to her, Tania? I realise this may be very dangerous for you, but I promise I will give up my own life... ...rather than let any further harm come to you. Please, Tania! Please... take me to her! I understood my son told you... ...not to come here again, Mr. Harcourt. - Where is she? - Your charming wife? She is here, quite safe and happy! What are you going to do about it, Mr. Harcourt? You must not expect... ...your Queensbury rules here, Mr. Harcourt. Now, about your wife... - You... - Please... ...let me say it for you. "If you have so much as harmed one hair of her head..." Is that how it goes? Now, about your... ...lovely young wife, Mr. Harcourt. I expect that you would like to see her. Sabena, would you be so kind as to go... ...and awaken her and bring her here? I will not say that she has not changed in any way, Mr. Harcourt. She has, as you might put it, grown up. Tasted the more sophisticated, more exotic fruits of... ...life. Oh, my God! God is hardly involved, Mr. Harcourt. Furthermore, having glimpsed these new horizons, I very much doubt if she will express any desire... ...to return with you to England. Marianne! Marianne, your husband is here. Don't you want to see him? No, I only want to see you. You've hypnotised her! She's in a trance! Marianne! Take your eyes away from him! Look at me, Marianne! For God's sake, look at me! Do you love him, Marianne? No, I love you. Don't you want him any more? No, I want only you. Prove to me that you do not love him. Well done, my dear! Sit there. Tania... ...I want you to... ...initiate Mr. Harcourt into our society. Do you understand what I mean? Go on, Tania. Wipe it off! We've got to get rid of the big servant! The others can't do anything without him! Bruno! Bruno! Come in here! Did you hear what I said? Come on! What are you frightened of? You, uh, know the priest, Father Xavier? - Well? - Yes. Take him this! Now? Now! Well? What are you waiting for? I can't. What are you frightened of? - I can't tell you. - Then I'll tell you! - It's Ravna, isn't it? - No! No! You're afraid of what he may do to your daughter! You know, she's up there in the chateau with him, don't you? They told me last night! Do you want the same thing to happen to her? No. No! Then take that message! Why don't I go? - No! - It'll be quicker! The moon will soon be rising. Tonight is gonna be a full moon. Come on, we've got work to do. I've been planning this night... ...ever since I traced Ravna to the chateau! From these medieval old books I've pieced together... ...the details of a ceremony! A ceremony to be performed when the moon is full, and Capricorn in conjunction with the Saturn, as it is tonight. What ceremony? A ceremony known as Corpus Diabolo Levitum: The Evocation of the Forces of Evil! It is a way of forcing evil to destroy itself! Now Ravna and all his acolytes are trapped in the chateau. Tonight I shall destroy them all. Won't they have gone away by now? No, not now. I've sealed all the entrances of the chateau... ...with a distillation of garlic! No vampire will pass that. Well? What does he say? What does the master say we should do? - You are to remain calm. - Remain calm? How can we remain calm? We demand to see him! - Where is he? - No, you don't! You're not leaving till you promise to bring him here to us! Where is he? Well? - We want to know the truth. - Why are we trapped here? What's this force that's preventing us... Are we in any danger? Yes, you are. They are trying to destroy us. What are we going to do? You must save us! You must trust me! Tell us what you're going to do! They came here tonight to take the girl away... ...because they did not want to risk her life... ...while they were trying to destroy us. She was our protection then. She must come back and protect us... again. I start by drawing a simple circle... ...inside which I shall inscribe the great Pentagram of Solomon, like this. Now... ...I leave a space there so that I can enter later. And now... That will protect us during the ceremony. The sword, the ring, the liquid and the horn. The ring, the sword, the liquid and the horn. Over. The first incantation. "I pray thee, without hurt done to my person or my companion. In the name of thine master and mine... ...by the four words... ...were the great god Alpha said from his own mouth, by the nine heavens in which thou dwellest, by the strength of the Sun and the Moon, and by the power of fire and water." She's gone! Quick, come with me! Girl is coming. Corpus Diabolo Levitum! Corpus Diabolo Levitum! Corpus Diabolo Levitum! I conjure thee, in the name of the great god Alpha! In the name of the mighty Beelzebub! Appear! It worked! Look! Look! Gerald!
