A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM THE SKIN OF THE WOLF Go tell the mayor! Wolves are here! Come on, go! And tell him to bring the money! Hungry? Winter was hard here, it must have been hell up there. Wolves are hungry and they keep breeding. Like rabbits instead of wolves. Five wolves and three cubs. 59 coins. I don't know if I have that much here. It's three wolves and three cubs. - So... - 69 coins! Three wolves, three cubs and two females. - But I thought... - Does it seem too much to you? Without a female there are no cubs and without cubs, no wolves. Do you think I'm ripping you off? One of the females was pregnant. Do you want me to count those four cubs too? I lose by killing pregnant animals. Because there will be less next year. The same goes for wolves. So you have to pay for it. I only have 50 coins here. If you agree, he can take those 19 coins off your purchases. We'll settle our accounts later. Give me two bottles. It was killed at the beginning of the winter. Together with the goats he guarded. They're smart. Always on the prowl. You can't let your guard down with a wolf. Aren't you going to take another dog? It would take long to train one. And I doubt it would adapt as well as the other one. If you don't want a dog, how about a woman? It's no easy place for a woman. And they're more difficult to tame. Company, work... And who knows, maybe a son. Wouldn't you want to have a son? That's no place for a child. Right... But in the future, who will get everything you've worked for? Some freeloader will get there to take everything that's still good. I will burn everything to the ground. None of these bastards will get a thing. Hey! This is nothing. Soon it will snow. We need to get more wood. I'll go heat up dinner. I'm pregnant. Have you ever thought of leaving? I'm fine here. Here alone? And what if something happens to us? What if you fall sick or something happens to you while hunting? Here you learn to survive, without realizing it. You'll see. Besides, I'm not alone anymore. You knew she was sick and pregnant. She was a widow and she was pregnant. What would people in town say? And what will you tell them now? That I killed her? You showed up with the money. That solved everything. When you came down with the child, everyone would think he was yours. You would've done the same. She is dead because of you. Your daughter loved you more than you loved her. Look at me! You and I had a deal. I gave you money and good skins. What did you give me in return? I want my money. You have until next spring. What kind of animal are you? Aren't you going to bury her? I already did. And I buried her son too. Wait, please. This is my youngest daughter. She'll go up with you if you marry her. It's fine by me. But it must be tomorrow. Don't take too many things. Your sister's stuff is still there. Daughter, I... I don't... You're his wife now. You belong to him. If you run away, he'll come after you and surely after me too. If everything goes wrong... If you can't stand it anymore... Mother... Don't worry. It's still a long way to go. God will look after her. Be careful! When will you be back? In four days. Is there anything you need? If you see my parents, tell them I'm fine. Eventually you'll get used to this. It's not that bad. It's tough, but not bad. When I come back, I'll teach you how to fix and set traps. I'm leaving. Be careful if you go inside the houses. There may be vipers at this time of the year. What about that curtain there? I've made it these days. You mother gave me this for you. And my father? I didn't see him. Whose are those open graves in the graveyard? One is my sister's, right? But there is another small one. They're not graves. They're holes. Your sister died because your father let her come here being sick and pregnant. That's a lie. He sold her for some money and good skins and did the same with you. That's why you're here. Do you understand? Let me do it. Leave it, don't make any effort. Put it there. I've lost the baby. Once you recover, you can go. Why? Days are short now. You'll have to wake up very early.
