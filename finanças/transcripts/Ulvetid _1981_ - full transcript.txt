Anna? Sorry, I thought you were in the kitchen. I was just painting the cupboard. I cut out a review yesterday, but now I can't find it. You were reading it in bed. Ahh yes, that's right. The postman was here. It's for you. Who is it from? I don't know, probably one of your female admirers. Would you mind reading it and see what she wants? - Oops! - What happened? It's just that letter. I forgot about it. It's from a girl who is obsessed with your books. And it reads... She asks for help with her wolf. A Wolf? Can you believe what people get themselves into! She suggests that you write a book about it. The wolf is called Nero! Ehheh..Yeah sure. Write and tell her that she is out of her mind. There is no return adress. She writes that she'll call. Ellinor!? Is that even a name? Why is it always me who have to write the nasty replies? You know, I have to keep up my good reputation. Thanks for your time. We still have much in life. I don't even know if it was a boy or a girl. Would that make any difference? It was so strange. I dared not even ask. I guess you don't ask about it when you abort. - It was no abortion! - Neither was it a birth! Come here! Come get your biscuit. Yes? Yes, that's me. She called, by the way... ...The girl with the wolf. She sounded quite normal, actually. So what's the idea about the wolf? That's the thing. She wants to give it to us! Dear lord! I assume you said no thanks? - What's so funny? - It's nothing... What did you say to her then? Well, what is the poor girl supposed to do with it? She has noone to help her with the wolf. She seemed quite desperate. Then I said to her, that we could keep it in the dog yard for a short while. - Only until autumn then! - At the most! It's only to help her in this emergency. And then we won't be bothered with all her letters anymore, right? Well, Rufus! It is tamed. I didn't know you were already here! My name is Anna. - But...Where did you sleep? - Right here. Here in the dog yard? But that's no place for... It was just too difficult to part from Nero. Humans haven't really had any imprint on Nero yet. It's crucial to get them before they open their eyes, ...if one wants the experiment to succeed. Get them before they can see. What experiment?? Come here. Come here and get it. Where is it? You can sleep here. Well, we were going to have a child, but... ...Well, it didn't happen... - I slept way too long! - It's because you needed it. You're not completely over the accident yet. - I better start making dinner. - No, no! I think Elinor is doing it now. Why don't you just relax. The hair on the leader's back will stand up, - and the tale is stretched out and the teeth are exposed. Big animals like dears and sheeps - - are killed fast by a hard bite to the throat that cuts the main artery open. But bigger animals, like oxen and moose, are being hunted by the whole pack. They bite them several times, again and again, in their backs and legs, so the bleed out. You see, they only succeed because wolves work together as a team. They coorporate just like humans! This one is for Nero! Ellinor and I thought it would be interesting to see Nero tear it apart. He has never done it before. Why not let him loose, so he can catch his own victims alive? Anna, why don't you like wolves? They are nasty and I don't believe they don't harm humans. Only the half-tamed ones could do so. Only the ones who lost their natural fear of humans can be dangerous. They are animals that can do harm! So you think they're the same as pests? That's also an animal that do harm! No, no. Pests are animals with the same eating habits as humans. Like you and me. And like Ellinor. And like Ellinor, yes. Aren't you coming? That was a probably a stupid question! Come on, Nero! Come and see what mom brought you! A nice little young hare! Come then! There, you want it? Show him how good you are! So good! It's almost unbearable! That's right, Nero! Start with the belly. You're so good! Nero, you're so good! What's the matter? But you're getting sick! There, there. - It's getting late, huh? - Aren't you coming to bed soon? First I have to finish these notes. I want to write a book! About the injustices done to wolves throughout the history. They have always been used as bogeys, right? Just think about the werewolf. Have you ever heard about werelions or werebears? And they are even way more dangerous than the wolf. Aren't they? I'll be in the forest. Then what about Ellinor? Isn't it easier that she looks after the beast herself? In fact, we are not supposed to enter it's cage at all. And she is a good helping hand around the house, right? Does it eat anything? If it's hungry enough. Bad bad wolf! Let go off her! Steady! You're already awake? I can not sleep. Try to... Do you know how you can tell if a person is a werewolf? If the persons eyebrows meet. Ohhh aren't you mommy's good wolf? Isn't is some nice girl company I got for you? Is she cute? Yes, she's cute. She's a bit nervous, right? Yes, she sure is a bit nervous. This is Nero's wife. Her name is Agripina. She's not very used to humans. When did it come here?? Tom thought it was a good idea too. Why is it that nobody ever ask for my opinion? I thought you and Tom talked to each other. I don't think this is a good idea at all! Them damn wolves were howling so I couldn't sleep. Now they seem to be quiet. Well, it's not fullmoon yet. Aren't you a bit... ...how to say it... ...unstable? Since the episode with the baby you haven't really been yourself. She uses the kitchen sink to defrost the meat! But so do you? She also stares at me in a strange way. It's like she hates me! Do you know what the Chinese symbol for trouble is? Two women under the same roof! Tom, who is she? Where does she come from? We don't even know who her parents are, and such! We don't even know her last name! Does it really matter? But all humans have need to tell about themselves! Ellinor completely avoids to utter a single word. Why? I'd say it's her own problem. Where do the wolves come from? Her interest in them is almost morbid. Ellinor's knowledge about these animals is amazingly huge! Just because she is deeply dedicated to something, - - you call her passion morbid! I think it is immensely interesting! May I also remind you, that we live by, that I write about animals! Wolves are gregarious animals! You need a whole pack to be really able to study them. This is a unique opportunity! Have you even considered how much this unique opportunity can end up costing? Ellinor already solved that issue. We buy animals from the knackeries! Sick animals, that are unfit for human consumption. Clever, huh? Even so, the money will mount up. And it sounds disgusting too! Sometimes women can really be killjoys! You can afford it if you want to! And I will afford the chance to study those animals! Ohh mommy's wolves! Come taste what I have for you! Who wants this piece? Aren't they lovely! What's the matter? I can't sleep because of those damn wolves! Usually it's only for a short while. Be patient! They've been howling for an hour! Enough is enough! - What are you going to do? - I'll wake up Elinor and let her shut them up! This is yum-yum for Agripina and Nero! Could you please stop using the kitchen for that purpose! It reeks of blood all over the house! - Tom is allright with it! - But in here, I am in charge! I made us some lunch. Tom said you were tired and needed to sleep. You must be very hungry! I thought it would be nice with some tartare! Hand me the notebook. Does it really matter whether they are polished or not? Why didn't you ask first? I did ask. Why don't you join me for a glass? If I want a glass in my own house, I will bloody just take it! Why don't you like me, Anna? I have nothing against you! Please don't spill port wine on the floor. It won't come off the wood easily. Now listen to me, Tom. Ellinor? Why did you wake me up? Where have you been? I don't know what you're talking about. Where should I have been? Rufus? Rufus?? Rufus is gone! He'll probably show up when he's hungry. But I already put his feeding bowl outside! He is gone! Huh? That's strange. Ellinor, Your eyebrows meet! And you plug them! I have no idea what she's talking about! Anna, what's the matter with you? Are you out of your mind? She plugs her eyebrows. Please apologize to Ellinor! She's crying right now. You heard what I said? I don't understand it, why can't you control yourself a bit? I only need one more chapter. One single chapter. What if it was me who was scared? If it was me who was crying? Then what? You? You're as strong as a horse. One could hammer nails in you. You're trying to, that's for sure! You haven't seen me try yet! I'm so sorry if I did something wrong! Anna? Anna? Anna, you're not well! It's nothing. I've just been so tired lately. That's also what Ellinor and I talked about. You really need a good, long sleep! Ellinor and you? Why are you talking about this with her? It's none of her business! Take it easy! Dear lord! Elinor is worried about you. You get her the wrong way all the time. And you can't keep wandering around the house during night, right? So, I've called the doctor and he'll make sure you get a nice long rest. But I don't want to! And when you wake up again, everything will be totally different. Ahhh, you're awake! Did you sleep well? What was in that injection? It was a mixture of morphine and sleeping medicine. You're crazy! I'm not sick! How could you make the doctor give me such thing? But you really needed to sleep and I to complete the last chapter! You were totally exhausted. - What time is it? - 6 o' clock. 6? Then I slept for almost 24 hours! How about a glass of champagne tonight? To celebrate the offspring! Well, pardon me the expression. I'm just so happy that the book is finished. Let's have a toast for my new creation! That sure is some awful looking legs you got there, Ellinor! Come have some more! What is that? I must have stepped in some of the blood when I was butchering. But the tracks end at the window? How did you get back then? I don't know. But I know how. It jumped out the window! - It? - Yes, it! Those are tracks from wolfpaws... ...that has stepped in blood! Those are wolfpaws, right Ellinor? Arent't they, Ellinor? He slipped out of my hands. Anna was sleeping and you were writing, - so I thought I'd give Nero a bite in the kitchen. Then he took off with a bone. Jumped out the window. It was open. Did you catch him? - Yes, close by the others. - Let's talk about something else! No matter what, anything but wolves! You're not done with the wolves yet, - - you're going to proofread the manuscript! Tell me what you honestly think about Ellinor. That thing about her eyebrows for instance? I know what you're thinking. You're thinking about werewolves, aren't you? It's no good. It doesn't matter. I've been thinking a lot about it myself. - You have? - Yes! And I've read about werewolves. Some hair-raising tales, I tell you! Listen to me! Apart from when eyebrows meet, there is another sign. It is also necessary to have a magic belt to transform into a wolf! Come on, wait! Of course I believe in werevolves! Of course I do... .. but as a neurosis! I mean, for some people it's perfectly real. Can we please change subject? If only we could get rid of Ellinor and her damn wolves! You seem tired. How about I go get the car? I'm certaintly not tired! I'll go get the car anyways! But it's so far! Rufus! No, Anna! Wait! He will not harm you! He just wants to play! Tom! Tom!! Nero! Why didn't you come at once? You were just waiting at the road. Why?? I didn't hear you. Not until you screamed. Well, that was quite a shock! I told her before that she's not allowed to take that beast out for walks! It belongs safely behind lock and key! That's not true! What? You never told her! I did! - You allowed her to! - Well... What's that supposed to mean? I mean, that it's over with taking them for a walk! Those wolves have to stay behind locks! That's it! Why can't we just get rid of them now? You have finished the manuscript. - It's no good. - There have to be some way! No, the manuscript. It's no good! I thought you were so happy about it? Not any longer. What happened? It's too hysterical! It's completely devoid of distance! There is no distance to the topic. Months of work wasted! We wish to be in private, Anna and I! They say humans get to look like their dogs in time. There has bloody always been something wolfish about her! How about I read your manuscript? No! You see... It's not me! It has been dictated to me. I've been writing it with a forced hand! Them windows are scary! They let the night in. Anybody can look in here! I think I'll draw the curtains! Then we also save some heat. We should always draw the curtains when it gets dark. Don't flush out the blood! Too much strenght is lost. From now on the meat must be defrosted outside! Do you understand? "They found the wolf and shot it... - ..."but when it turned cold, it transformed in to a human body". "An old man, who was missing the same three fingers... - ..."that had been found next to the dead body". I've found books, lots of books on the topic. Well... Nothing comes from nothing. Not with so many writers and so many tales. There are way too many stories for it to be a coincidence. Who came up with the idea that I was to be given that injection? Ellinor. Why? She wanted that book to be finished! She controlled me! Just as if I was hypnotized! Where is the book? I burned it. No one shall ever know what she made me write!!! No one! Maybe the werewolf is a kind of insanity for he who believes in it. Hello? - Any news? - No. We have to get rid of those wolves! I do everything I can. You seem so agitated? I am agitated! What happened? I went to her room. And searched through it. I looked everywhere. It looks like she has never even been there! It looks completely uninhabited. But then... Then what? I found only one thing. Only one single thing of her belongings. This one! "...And the human will put on the belt, that turns him into a wolf..." "...and jump out through a closed window". It's just a belt. Just a belt! Which she never wears. At least not when we see it. Maybe she has gained weight and can no longer fit it? Bah... She's thin as a straw! Stop it, for gods sake. Stop it! Why is that belt her only belonging? There are so many youngsters who care not for their appearance. - Except for their eyebrows? - Shut up! I want to get to the bottom of this! Put that belt back where it came from! Not until I have seen what she'll do without it! Tonight we'll stay up and wait. We only pretend that we'll go to sleep. That's insane! You heard that? There is something... They are calling! Can you hear them call? Look! She wants to join them as a wolf. Can't you tell by her behaviour? She wants to be a wolf! If we can't get rid of them, then what? What do you mean by that? Well... Would you dare give her back the belt? If you 're afraid of giving it back, then you're completely crazy! Weren't it you who was scared in the first place? Of course, I could not get through to you! Ellinor had completely twisted your mind! It helped when you discovered, that she made you write that trash. Well, don't you like compliments? She is head over heels in love with you! Werewolves don't fall in love! I don't believe in such thing! Not anymore? Only when I'm afraid, I believe in it. - And you're not afraid anymore? - I will not loose my mind! That's not something you can decide yourself. I'll continue the calls tomorrow. We might be lucky. Isn't she coming? Maybe. When does she eat? Or is she still eating at all? A little, every once in a while. There you see, it's the belt. She can't live without the belt. Do we really have to see her? I'll go get her now! Ellinor! You're soaked! We are a bit worried about you. Is something bothering you? Have we done something to you? Give me the belt! Give it to me! Don't ever touch it again! Never! I did wrong hiding it where you could find it. Why can't I touch the belt? If you can find it, then so can she. Nonsense! You don't have to hide it from me. I'll take no chances! You're mad! You have changed! Finally! We did it! We bloody did it! The animal dealer in Belgium that you called! Tomorrow they'll already be here with the transporter! Well, now it's your turn. It's no good, he has to go. It's time to put an end to that farce. I found this. Thank you! My next book will be about seabirds! I will solely focus on seabirds! Hunting at sea has become so popular. Are you listening at all? It's just hard to grasp that it's finally over. Do you realize that we haven't talked about anything else - - but those damn wolves for the past five months? God knows what will happen to Ellinor. She probably goes back to wherever she came from. She must belong somewhere. We all do. An old habit! And it keeps the heat inside. Hush! You hear it? One of the wolves must have escaped! Nero! It came from the meadow! She probably turned that beast loose. Get some clothes on. Look! At your right. Bloody hell! Shouldn't we call the police in stead? - You'll never find it. - I have to get it! But it's wounded and dangerous! Get the flashligt from the backseat. I saw something. Maybe it was just a cat. There it is. It was the same I saw before. - Come! - It's insane going out to it! I have to do it! You point the light straight in front of me. It is very close. I can feel it. Anna! Point the lights at it! I finally got you, mate. I'll be damned! That's not Nero! It's a female! They said all the wolves made it there. No one was missing. Say what? There must be missing the one we placed at the bottom of the lake?! Nonsense! That's rubbish! Ouch! God damn it! We better have the doctor examin your arm. That animal dealer clearly cannot count! There's no doubt it was one of those bloody wolves that almost killed me last night. I'll call the doctor at once! He is here now. Tell him it was a dog! It sounds better. People talk, you know. I'll have to give you some injections. We don't want you getting any infections! I really would have loved to see the wolves! It's too late now. Weren't they dangerous? Did you ever get bitten? It was a dog, I already told you! That bite?? That's a human bite! Tom! Find it! Damn it! Find it! I have killed Ellinor! I was just a wolf, I swear it! No, now the body is cold. It's no longer a wolf! Today it's a human body lying at the bottom of the lake! And then comes spring. And when the ice is gone, it will be pulled out of the water, - - and I will be convicted as a murder! As the one who killed Ellinor!!! No, that's insane! Take a look! Look with your own eyes! No! Ellinor lives! Ellinor lives!! Tom, you hear me? Ellinor lives!
