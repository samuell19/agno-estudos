Uhhh... Oh, God. Oh! He's just such a great Dad! She loves anything to do with fish, eels, the sea, and he surprised us with a trip to the aquarium. Uh... I wanna be married. The way he is so sweet with her, it's kinda of sexy, you know what I mean? Yeah... The fuck? You got to be fucking kidding me! Jod. Hey, what's up? So, um, guess who broke their fucking foot? Oh, my God. You? Axl broke his fucking foot in L.A. this week. Axl? Axl Rose... Who the fuck do you think I am talking about? Guns N' Roses. -Guns N' Roses. Aw. -Yes, yes. He broke his fucking toe... -or something? -No. Seriously, and we're just finding out about this now? The concert is this fucking weekend and I'm fucking pissed because I am not fucking driving four fucking hours not to fucking see him do the fucking snake dance. That's fucking bullshit! Are you okay? Why are you yelling at me? Even guys like that have those. No, no. No. I've just been bed garbage all day. All day? No, I literally slept for like 18 hours. Yelling at the moment. No, it's just... I'm driving alone to a Guns N' Roses concert, like a loser, and I couldn't even give away free tickets on the internet to strangers. No, okay. Maybe somebody will say yes. No, I'm definitely going to die alone in a nursing home and no one is going to come get my body. Girl, that's not gonna happen. No, no, I've worked in nursing homes and that totally happens. No one visits you, and then no one comes and picks up the body. And then you're buried by strangers. Boo, get it together. I'm just going to give up and become a burden on the state. You can live in hospitals for free if you want to, you can just show up, be a lazy piece of shit, people are obligated to take care of you. Well, I actually have to run here. What? What are you guys doing? We're going out tonight. I'll call you. Okay? Oh, no, I mean, I have to pack. Okay. -I'll call you. -Okay. Bye. -Hey. -Hey, Sis! How are you? Good! Just getting some stuff together to go dancing tonight. Are the kids already on the bus? Yeah, they are. Oh. You okay? No, no I just... I wanted... I wanted to tell them hey. Ah, well, they're doing good. Softball and bullshit. Yeah, no, I... I miss those little shits, yeah. How's the hospital? It's alright, I mean, same shit, different shift. You know? Yeah. You taking another contractor? I might, or I might not. I don't know. You like it? Yeah, no, I was... I was actually thinking about buying an RV. -An RV. -Yeah, like a... -What do you mean? RV. -No. Yeah, like a camper that you drive. Now, why would you get an RV? No, it's just... you know, you can travel and I thought there's nothing happening in L.A. except for my gays. And I figured, you know, I could... just spend like a year like just kicking it around, like, West Coast. Just taking a bunch of... shorter term-contracts, and I figured I could go, like Portland -and then Seattle... -Jodie, this is ridiculous. That's crazy. Isn't that a little dark? I mean was it just like amazing? I just don't know why that's so crazy! Have you met anyone else there? No one? Okay, no, but have you tried dating in L.A.? I'm just saying give it a chance. Don't go all-in on RV. Okay, well, you know what? Why don't you just tell the kids that I miss them. -Are you okay? -And... No, I'm fine! Jodie. -Okay, I'm gonna talk to you later. -Jodie. Yeah, yeah, Jess, I'm gonna talk to you later, okay bye. Ugh! Hey, dude, are you okay? -I'm not a dude! -My bad. -I'm not a dude! Look! -Okay, sorry! Hey, I'm sorry I yelled at you, but it's just when I start crying I can't stop, and also you scared me and I didn't know what to say. No... I'm sorry that I thought you were a man. It's just from behind you looked like you were. With the bandanna and stuff and I'm kinda drunk. You don't look like a man now that I'm fully seeing you. Uh... are you going to be okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm good. It's killer show, right? Axl was fucking amazing. Just blows my mind every time. Yeah... totes. -I just wanted to see him snake-dance. -Yeah. Well, do you like need me to call you a cab or? My car's right there. Are you driving it? Well, I'm not gonna leave it here. Okay... well you... you just seem like you're a little drunk and you've been crying. I just... Yeah, if I want to drive my fucking car I'm gonna drive my fucking car. And I don't see what crying has to do with it because I'm not crying right now. Where are you staying? The Palm. That's where I'm at. Oh, well great fuck it, then you drive us! But don't fucking touch me... I swear to god, if you fucking touch me I will kill you and I'm not gonna have a problem with it. I promise not to touch you. Cool. Get that. I'm Dustin. Jodie. Thanks for driving us. Yeah, no problem. Here... What the fuck are you doing? Snake dancing like Axl. You said you wished you'd seen him snake dance. Oh, my god. Wow. That's ridic. I'm gonna go change and drink by the pool. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna do that, too. Are you inviting yourself? Yeah, I guess. You guess or you are? I am. I mean if that's okay? Oh. Okay. Sure. Do you wanna hang out? We don't have to. No... Let's do it. I'll meet you by the pool. Cool. Hello? We're here, babe. Oh, shit, yeah. Can you buzz us in? Yeah, I'll buzz you in. -Please send that. -Yeah, I'll buzz you in. Don't go back to sleep. I'm buzzing! Guys, there's something seriously wrong with my toilet. What? What is happening? No. Come on, I don't know what to do, just look at it. It stinks. Is it overflowing? Jesus fuck, Jodie! That's actually impressive. Oh, no, I was not ready for this. What a log... Good for you, honey. I was saving it. Christ, Jodie, that was... very unnecessary. Maxwell was impressed. I bet he was. He probably shits pellets. So, drinks, guys? Yes. Double. Are you gonna shower? I want to leave in like an hour. Yeah, I'm gonna shower. Also, my cousin Alicia is coming tonight, so, let's be nice to her. okay? What the fuck is that supposed to mean? I'm always fucking nice. Shower! I want to leave at 9! Hey, bitch! I'm going to the bathroom. You want to come with? Yeah, I guess I kinda gotta pee. Whoo! Whoa. Whew! Girl, these rum and cokes were making me have to pee something crazy. Yeah... they'll do that to you. Ugh! Oh, my god. This guy is blowing me up right now. We just fucking matched... there is an incubation period. God, have some chill, brother. You can't start blowing me up two seconds later. I'm just not into it. I'm not down for that. You know I'm not down like that. Do you get that? Like... they think you're going to drop everything and be ready for a date... Jodie? Jodie? Hey, where did you go? What? You left me in the bathroom. Oh, yeah, I was done, so I left. I'm sorry, did you need help? No. No, it's fine. It's cool. Okay. Sorry. Okay, sorry. Oh. Doing great. Yep. Let it out. Let it all out. I'm having fun! I shouldn't have had so many pina coladas. You had the right amount of pina coladas. -Here, drink some water. -Let's... let's dance. No, we're done. -We're done doing that. -I like... Did you ever think about getting an Aphrodite-type hairdo where you look like a goddess? No, Pete, I haven't thought about that. Why don't you drink some of this water? Drink this water. Okay, does it have vodka in it? No, absolutely not. Oh, honey! Who put water... who put water in there? Me, I put water in that. Ugh. Wow, she's a lady. Yeah. Nice shirt! What are you drinking? Still beer. Ah, yeah, me, too. -Uh, if you need one take one. -Oh, it's okay. No really, I'm here by myself. I don't need to drink all of this. Shut up! I'm here by myself! I was just telling my friends that I would be the only loser here alone but... So where do you live? Santa Clarita. I live in L.A.! -Crazy! -Yeah, that's super close. You know I wanna say, uh, I'm not a loser, I just... couldn't find anyone to come with me. Seriously? Did I hurt your feelings? No. You couldn't get your wife to come with you? I don't have a wife. You... you look like you would have a wife. Nope. I did. Did she divorce you for wearing that shirt? You are being sarcastic. You're about to feel really bad. She's dead. Oh, fuck, I'm sorry. Eh, it's alright. It happened like two and a half years ago, it's fine. So, you like Guns N' Roses. Yeah, fuck, yeah. I mean I grew up with them. I fucking love them. Axl is a God. I'm not a gay but he is the sexiest lead singer out of any of those fucking bands. No, totally. I've been in love with him since I saw him on MTV when I was like nine. He's legit the first man I ever masturbated to. Sexy guy. Did you do the same thing? No, I did not. So you're... you're not gay. No, I just told you I had a wife. A lot of gay guys have wives. And also, we just bonded over how sexy Axl is, and if someone says aloud that they're not gay it's usually because they're gay. It's just all my friends are gay, and I just instantly lose attraction for someone if I get the slightest inkling that they're even a little bit into dudes. Well, I'm not. I don't have a problem with it. So you've never had a guy, like, suck your dick or anything. Not even once. I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry! I have trust issues! I've... It's just... then it's something that you can just never satisfy in another person and it's just, like, I'm never gonna have a dick, I'm so sorry. -So what do... what do you do? -Oh, I hate that question. Sorry. No it's fine, I just... I hate people's reaction to my answer. -What, do you work for the IRS or something? -No... uh, I'm a funeral director. -Oh shit, fuck! -See! I mean I'm a travel nurse. So I spend most of my days like... up to my balls in blood, and shit and bedpans. Well, we have that in common except for the bedpans. Yeah, the shit just runs right down the drain. Yeah we put everything down there. It's really no different than what someone would flush down a toilet. Oh, sick. I'm probably gonna wander into the desert one day never to be seen or heard from again. What do you mean the desert? Well, I'd rather be, like, pecked by vultures or something rather than die in some nightmare nursing home. I've... I've pretty much accepted that I'm just gonna live the rest of my life a lonely old lady. Like a old cat woman? No, not a cat lady because I fucking hate animals. All they do is they piss and shit in your house, and they wanna be on you, and they cost you money, it's just, no, I'm gonna be like an old hag. Like a fag hag. Like, literally, all my friends are giant 'mos, I'm telling you! Why do you think you're going to spend the rest of your life alone? You're a woman. You could just find some random guy to be with if you really wanted to. What do you think I spend all of my time doing? I can't find anybody. I guarantee you there are guys out there that would be with you based off of just the fact that you are any woman. Well, if there are, I can't find them. I'm constantly being rejected by women. Yeah, probably because you're always going after the super hot ones, like all men. I'll never understand why these hideous man-beasts are chasing after model-types, like that's delusional. I don't go after women like that. I go for women like you. A woman like me. Meaning what? Okay, let's not pretend like you didn't just call me a hideous man-beast. I was not talking about you! Well, I wasn't talking about you! You said women like me like not models. Neither one of us is a model, all right? So, let's not pretend like... either of us has anything over on the other one. Marilyn Monroe was a size 16! Okay... Fuck off. Oh, my god. Oh! You're such a pussy! Text Dustin, 'Are you in your room?' Hey, it's Dustin. Leave a message. -Hey, it's Dustin. Leave a message. -What the fuck? Shit, shit. Hey, it's Dustin. Leave a message. Hey, um, so, um, I'm calling just 'cause I'm here. Um... yeah, I... I was gonna drop this stuff off so, hopefully... you will feel better um, so, yeah, I just... I... I figured I would drop them by, um, I'm not going to stay or anything. Uh... so, um, I'm gonna hang out around my room so just give me a call and... I can drop this stuff by and if you're feeling better you know maybe we can hang, or not, whatever is cool with me... either is fine. Okay... talk soon! Whoa! Okay, I don't know what that was. Okay, um, okay b... uh, okay... okay, bye. Fuck! Fucking text threads! I don't care! Oh, wow! Is this a suite? Yeah, I'm treating myself, no kids, no corpses. You have kids? Yeah, three. Kaylee is 8, Davis is 11 and Jay is 16. That explains the shirt, Dad. Would you stop it with the shirt? It's really bad. I'm trying to help you. You want me to take it off? There. Oh. Now you don't have to see it anymore. -Just... -Help! Okay... Jesus. Slow down. Shut up and show me your thick rod! Oh. I have no blood. I need water. Oh, are we not doing that? Uh, what? Cuddling. You don't want to spoon? Oh... oh, God, I feel like shit. Oh, god, my stomach. Are you okay? Oh, my, God! Here, let me... let me help you! No, I'm okay! No, seriously, I'm an actual nurse. Are you clammy? No seriously, I'm fine. Do you normally get this hung over? No. Well, then maybe you have a bug... or you're probably dehydrated. I'm gonna be okay, you should just go. I just need to feel sick. Okay, well let me just look... Oh, God... really... seriously... no thanks. Sorry. Okay, well, I could get you some Pepto, or a sports drink, some electrolytes? Seriously, just go. I could drive you back to L.A. if you don't feel like you can... I flew. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go get some supplies and then I'll be right back. Honestly, I just need to be by myself. No, I'm gonna be right back. Hey, Sis, what's up? Yeah. No it's in the mail and there's a card in there for mom too so sign it. I'm good! I went to Guns N' Roses last night. Oh, how was it? Amazing. Aw. Axl was so, so good. Yeah. Yeah. No it... it was awesome. Oh, good, good. So, guess what? What? I met a boy. You met a boy? Yeah, at the concert. Oh, Lord. I don't know about it. Oh, shut up! You met him at the concert? Well, so what? I hope he's not wild and crazy. No! No, he is nice! He's a funeral director. Christy? Christy... why is that funny? Oh, my God. That is ridiculous. -No! -Does he have a wife? No! He doesn't have a wife. And you're about to feel really bad because she's dead. -Oh. -Yeah, a lot of people don't find true love until their second marriages anyway. Did you say that to him? No, I did not say that to him, I just met him last night. Well, don't come out so drunk. You're doing that thing. -I am not! -Jodie, come on. -You know how you get. -I am not! You're getting intense. You know I guess I thought... you'd be fucking excited for me because you're always crawling up my fucking ass about meeting someone. But I guess that's too much to ask from my bitch sister. Oh, fuck you, Jodie. No, fuck you! Fuck you! You... go fold the fucking shirt! You need to... Fucking cunt. Hey, Dustin! Hey. I know you're in there! Seriously, what the fuck? I brought you this stuff, I just... I want you to feel better. I'm not crazy. Seriously, fuck! -Hey! -Hey, I'm sorry, uh, I have to go. Do you want me to drive you to the airport? No, I have my car. Um, sorry... family emergency. You said you flew. Oh, weird. Well, do you want your bandanna? You know what? You keep it. Keep it? What about this stuff? Do you... do you feel better? Uh, no, I'm good. I hope everything works out for you. You hope everything works out for me? What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Look, I don't know, I'm just saying things. Alright? I... I feel like shit, my son broke his arm, I don't want your stuff, I really have to go. Okay, well, why didn't you just text me that? Like, you could've just said, 'Jodie, hey, great time last night. My kid broke his arm. Call me sometime.' -That's not that hard! -Cause I don't want to do that, alright? I... I don't want to get into anything with you. Not right now, not for the foreseeable future. Well, why didn't you just tell me that instead of making up some lie about your kid? -It's not a lie. -Okay. It's not! Here... Fuck. There, my son broke his arm, okay? -Okay, well, I believed you. -Okay! Bye, Jode. You do not get to call me Jode. Bye, Ghost. Bye, Ghost! I didn't even like you that much. I hope your son feels better but not for you, for him! I hope that he feels better and you feel bad. You fucking ghost! I'm, literally alive and right here. You fucking banshee! Be gone! Jesus Christ. Ugh! Oh, fuck! Do you smoke? Sometimes, sure, I'm down. Cool. Hey, can I borrow that? Yes, but that is a very special bandanna. Why? I bought that for my first Guns N' Roses concert when I was thirteen in Chicago. My dad drove me down from... We lived in Milwaukee... and he drove me all the way down just to take me. He didn't even go, he just dropped my off and hung out at a Denny's. Sweet. Do you like being a dad? Of course. It's like the most fulfilling thing in my life. I want to be a mom. Don't worry. I didn't poke holes in the condom or anything. I did tie it off and put it in the mini-fridge though. -What? -I'm kidding! I'm not crazy. Sometimes I do worry my uterus is just going to rot out before I find someone to have kids with. Having kids either makes you more selfish or completely selfless. Which one are you? Uh, fuck, I guess that's not entirely accurate. I guess sometimes you feel both. You know sometimes you lie so you can smoke a joint and jerk off instead of going to your daughter's softball game, other times you take a bullet for them. Maybe it's a sliding scale. I think I'd be more selfless. I feel less anxious when I'm thinking about things that aren't myself. What's that called? Externa... externalizing. What about your wife? What was she? Oh, bad question. It's fine, we don't have to talk about. No, it's fine. Um... yeah, she was more selfish. You know, she'd like disappear. Drinking and sleeping basically. -Was she an alcoholic? -Yeah, big time. I'm sorry. Eh, was what it was. Nothing to do about it now. Do you mind if I ask how she happened? How she happened? Like how she died? Oh, yeah. Sorry, I'm stoned. Uh, yeah, she killed herself. Fuck. But I don't think she actually meant to. Excuse me? You want the story, huh? I mean, no, we don't have to talk about it, but, yeah, kinda. Alright. Uh, so I came home from work, I was working on this girl who had been in an accident and... uh, it was bad. How bad? Like, really bad. Jay was thirteen at the time, I come in, 'Where's mom?' 'Oh, she's taking a bath.' Go up to check on her, figuring I'm gonna find her plastered and then an argument is gonna ensue. I go in, she's laying in the bath, candles all over the bathroom. She drank six bottles of wine. She passed out, slipped under the water. It was red. I thought she had slit her wrists. It was wine, one of those giant glasses, you know, that fits the whole bottle? Candles were so close to the curtains, anything could have just caught them on fire, set the whole house on fire. She could've killed the kids. It's heavy. Was she depressed? Fuck, yeah, she was depressed. Have you been in a relationship since then? No. But it doesn't mean I haven't dealt with it. No, of course. What about you? -A relationship? -Yeah. Nursing school. But really that was more of a set-up where we slept in the same bed and we had sex... He sounded like a frog. He was like 'Jodie, you need to pay this month's rent.' Please write a check.' What frog sounds like that? No, I don't know, but it was... that was close. And now it's like the only men who can stand me are gay. Sometimes I think I should just... transition into being a bear but it's like, that's not now trans works and also I'm not attracted to gay men so. What's a bear? It's a big hairy gay man. Would I be a bear? -Absolutely. -Huh. And I don't know why I am so worried about it. My sisters are married and they're fucking miserable. Why? Well, one of them lives in Michigan. And her husband expects her to just sit at home, and cook, and clean, and have sex with him, even though he's gotten really fat and he doesn't do anything to try to look like a decent human being. And she, like, lives for this middle-school drama. Shoot me if that is ever the highlight of my life. And the other one is engaged to this man whose only passion is hunting arrowheads, and also, he calls watching their children alone... babysitting. It's like some men are such man-babies. Like they're completely incapable of taking care of themselves, and they expect just because they make just a little bit of money that they should just act like an invalid who needs to be waited on, hand and foot, whenever they're not at work and that none of their decisions or opinions are to be challenged. And it's just, like, wake up! And, honestly, I haven't met a straight man lately who's not a complete dick... A guy called me pig hag! Pig hag? Yeah! Because we were supposed to go bowling together and I slept through my alarm because I'd had three all-night shifts in a row. But then it's like he goes completely bonkers on me! And then, suddenly I am the bipolar, lonely, pig hag cunt, and I need to go hang out with my gays. I had to block him. Jesus, that's terrible. Yeah, I'm almost out of blocks. You can run out of blocks? Yeah, it's fucked! Pig hag? Stop. -Stop! -I'm sorry that that happened to you! -No, it's cool. -No! It's not, men can be awful. I'm sure I've been awful. Probably. Probably will be awful again. Well, don't be awful to me. If I'm bad you can always block me. I'm... I'm almost out of blocks, that's a ter... That's a terrible idea. -Hello? -Hey, girl. -Yeah, I'm fine. I... -What's wrong? Um... no, I'm fine. I've just been really busy working and hermiting. Yeah, you... you... Yeah, you can come over. -Yeah, come over. Come over. -Okay. Thanks. Oh, look, she's alive. We seriously thought you were dead, bitch. -I'm not. -Honey, why does it smell like this in here? Rotisserie chicken. Okay, Brittany Murphy. What is going on? Did something happen with the Guns N' Roses guy? You haven't answered any of the threads or a single phone call. You haven't posted about it on Facebook either. Yeah, cut this shit. What happened? Regale us. Okay, so, basically, I met this guy after the Guns N' Roses concert, and he just comes up to me, and he starts talking to me about my outfit because we're wearing matching bandannas or whatever. But then he ends up being like really nice. We spend the whole night together. He's a funeral director. That's so hot. So we meet, we hang around, and then we end up going back to his hotel room, where we bang, but then he tells me all about his dead wife. Oh, fuck! Yeah, apparently, she was like a huge alcoholic. She like, drowned in the bathtub and she lit the house on fire -while their kids were inside of it. -What? Yeah, I don't remember all of the details because I was a little stoned when he was explaining it. But then, I end up comforting him, and then we bang again! And I kissed him. You kissed him? Yeah, I ended up sleeping there. And the next morning, I was like cuddling with him, like I'm... like I'm spooning him, and he's like, 'No, no, don't touch me I'm sick.' Well, was he actually sick? Well, I did watch him throw up. Well maybe he was legitimately sick, girl. Okay, well, I offered to take care of him like 'Hello I'm a fucking nurse!' But he was like, 'No, no, I'm good.' Like he, basically, yelled and screamed at me to go. And then, I'm like, 'I can drive you back to L.A. if you're sick, ' but he ghosted. Like, I called him, and I texted him, and I called him again, but it went to voicemail. I didn't leave a voicemail. It's just, he never responded. -Okay. -Well, that's the problem. What? What's the problem? You cared, honey. I cared? Yeah, you freaked him out, you were willing to do too much too fast. Okay, basically, the way relationships work now is that whoever cares more loses and becomes unattractive to the other party. Okay, well, that makes zero fucking sense. Yeah, well, that's why you're not supposed to respond to guy's texts that you like right away. If I'm interested, why would I wait? That's stupid. No, girl. Now I start any conversation with a man by saying I'm not interested, and I have never pulled in more solid sevens in my life. Hot men. Fresh men. That's bullshit. I was just trying to be nice. We had sex, we talked about personal stuff. I don't want to marry him or something. -But don't you? -No! I barely know him. Well, did you talk to him about being alone for the rest of your life? I mean we got pretty deep. He was telling me about his dead wife. That's a lot. He sensed that you were getting too invested. Like, you were too eager to be a thing. Well, he could've just told me that! He ghosted. I felt like a fucking idiot. I spent all day wondering what the fuck went wrong. And the really fucked up thing is I really liked him. He was funny, and we got along. We had shit in common, like, literally shit and faeces and he had a thick rod, and I didn't hate kissing him. So, yeah, maybe I did want to see him again, so what? When people like each other, don't they wanna see each other again? Like, why can't I say what I feel? Why can't I say 'I like you' without, apparently, being some fucking crazy person? Because straight men are fucking garbage! That's why. They can't express their feelings, or have anyone else express feelings at them, let alone giving a fuck about them! You've ruined me! My gays have ruined me! I'm ruined! Hush your mouth. No, I'm too used to men expressing their feelings and caring about my opinions and then letting me speak! On a date, I can't get out a sentence without being interrupted! I mean what the fuck? Honey! You don't think from time to time we've been reckless with men's hearts? We treat you with respect because you're our friend and that's what friends do for each other. A guy called me pig hag. -Uh... -What? Do you guys walk around just calling people pig hag? Pig hag? No. Not unless someone wants me to. Yeah, and fat, and lonely, and bipolar, and cunt, because I slept through a fucking date. That's crazy. Yeah, and the really fucked up part is is after he spends like three days textually harassing me he sends me a message like, 'Hey, let's start over and hang out.' Like, mother fucker, I am about to file a police report! First of all, that's terrible, block his number immediately. I'm almost out of blocks! Okay, look at me... listen to me. This man, this Guns N' Roses man, funeral director, he is not the end-all be-all. Yeah, you've got to pump the brakes. I mean this is exciting but it's sad, too. I think you might be setting the stakes a little bit too high up. I mean, just cause it might not work out with this guy doesn't mean you're gonna end alone. It's not that serious. There's other fish in the sea, girl. It's... I'm just... I'm fucking lonely! You know dating is really fucking hard. I'm thirty-six! I'm like five years away from being someone's weird aunt. And I just... I'm not ready to be that person at family gatherings that everybody feels sorry for because they know I don't have anywhere else to go. Girl, we are all lonely. Don't try to be in a relationship just to be in a relationship. Not a one of us has a significant other right now. No, it's a different for you, you're gay. And also, lies! I see you all on your phones with boys all the time. Not really, it's all an illusion. Just because we're texting men all the time and getting loads up the ass doesn't mean we're not lonely. Okay, well, I would settle for that. So you guys have to help me take sexy pics for my profile. Girl, no. Yes! Come on! I want to do revolving dick door. It's not fair, you get to do it. I have not played ass up door open in a long time, for your information. And I don't really think that this is the answer. I mean, you love to travel! You were in Morocco and Spain last year alone, bitch. What about the RV? No, my sister was right, that's fucking stupid, and I don't wanna talk about it! Seriously dude, this is not the answer. If you think revolving dick door is gonna make you feel better -you're out of your fucking mind. -Oh, shut up, Nate. Why are you talking like you have any fucking moral high ground? You get your ass hole blown out every fucking weekend because you're shit-house wasted. Accurate, but unacceptable. Take pics now. Oh, my God. I'm gonna say, 'Thirty-six, fat ass, ass up, door open, Buzz 585.' Maxwell, how should I be? Um, I don't know, I would just do like, whatever you wanna be serving when they get here. -Maxwell! -What? Shut up, Nate! Yeah, so like, I don't know, just like, bend over, tooch your ass up, and just, like work, bitch. -That's how we're working it? -Yeah, don't show my face. Kay. I don't think I like what I'm seeing. Yeah, as a former face-down ass-up queen, I do not condone this. This is a micro solution to a macro problem. You cannot fill the void in your life with dicks. We've tried! And you cannot fill it with someone meaningful until you yourself feel meaningful. Yeah, Jodie, you can't go walking down the street requiring every man you see to validate your parking. You need to validate your own parking, okay? Having ten dicks inside of you is guaranteed to not make you feel better. Are you listening? Yes, ten dicks. Got it. -I got it. -Great. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, guys. I'm sorry, Nate, for what I said before. I get it, I do, I get it. I don't need a man, but I just... I feel like I will feel better if I get fucked right now. And I just... I need you guys to just not judge me. Alright girl, live your truth. Just keep your phone near you and text us if things get weird. Come in! Thanks. You're welcome. You've got a great ass. Thanks. Are you ready? Can I just... Yeah. Is it okay if I turn on the light? Yeah. So, I'm just gonna... -Yep. -Mm-hm. Okay, I'm just gonna... Ahh. Ah, yeah. Is that okay? Does it feel good? Mm-hm. Okay, good. I want you to feel good. Ah... ah yeah, uh... Can I, uh... Can I ask you a weird question? Mm-hm? Can... can I see your face? -Will you turn over? -Yeah, sure. Sure. Oh. Wow. You're beautiful. Thanks. Ah, yeah. Oh, ah. Oh, ah. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... Ah... ah... Ah! Ah. Oh. Ah, yeah. Would you, um, wanna stay and watch a movie or something? Oh... Fuck!
