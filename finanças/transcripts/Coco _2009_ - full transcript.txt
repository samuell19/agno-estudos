II hums the air of "Pretty Woman" Listen to the new slogan. "Wet Water." "Wet", wet. "Water", water. So what? It's wet water. Rather do "Water water". "Water water." It's good. Note. It's a concept. Water called Water makes "Waterloo". This is creation. It's not my job. Listen to me. Go ahead, send. For the woman's water bottle. "Lady command." "Lady command." Ah! You're a vicious one.

The apartment I bought you: "It's too much". It's too big for me. I can't get used to it here. In the 19th, I had my neighbors, the Zamzem. I miss them. I can buy the adjoining apartment from them. You're kidding? No. They didn't wait for you. Their son is a billionaire... ...in the USA. Ah yes? Take your time, darling. Before, I had the time, but not the money.

This is the thousandth of what I can do to you. What do I add to that? Floral decoration, lookalikes. I have doppelganger lookalikes. I have Johnny, Madonna, Justin Timberlake. The keum comes from Strasbourg. A nutjob. I can even have your double. I'm putting you in a movie. I encrust you, Samuel and you. From Niro, he says: "Mazel tov!" It gets very big. I no longer control the size. Here, look. This morning, again. Boris Marciano asked me Snow White and the seven dwarfs. I brought them back to him. Here is the order form. The 7 dwarfs? You do not believe me? No. I swear it is true. I called the association of the dwarfs of France. Stop, stop. Did you take me for a Jean-Jacques? Not at all, Coco. You don't measure the magnitude of the thing. - I know. It is the event of my life and of the country. So put me on the spot. You're too small. You're too small. You can not. Sorry, you're too small. Coco, wait. Coco! What does "too small" mean? I need someone to match me. I see only one thing: The Americans. Coco! The American! A slam door l'm American or not? YEAH! So? * Let us leave the wings of the Mill * Protect us until the morning * Make way for sleepless nights * It's magical They speak Chinese * It's magical ...- He's going to arrive....- *Loves ...- * And every night * Paris jewelry * Well, it's Paris * Let us leave the wings of the Mill * Protect us until the morning * Make way for sleepless nights Look closely * It's magical Applause ...- What did he say?

I set up call transfer. "Call forwarding?" Call forwarding. I'll explain it to you, my daughter. If he calls there, the call, from the 16th... ... it bounces here and it lands. The phone is ringing It's Coco. It's certain. He's looking for you everywhere. You don't answer? Hold on. You know, time to get there... It's long, 800 m2. ...- It's very long. Do you see how big it is? Huh? Who is the most beautiful? It's daddy! Who is the nicest? It's daddy! Who is it who can lift cars? It's dad. Who are you going to marry? With Dad. AIE Aie Aie!

I do not need. I do not need! Ouch! Quick quick! It's okay? Yes. Cardio! Oh dear... You have a coronary lesion. Your coronary arteries are narrowed. This coronary artery disease requires a triple bypass. You have to act quickly to avoid the heart attack. We take, in the rib cage... ... a mammary artery. "Breast?" Yes. What does this have to do with my mother? It is an artery. An artery located behind the rib cage... ... which I will saw. These arteries have the advantage of withstanding the pressure. You have to operate quickly. And the bar mitzvah? Advance your "bardiza". Bar mitzvah. "Bardiza." Bar mitzvah. Do it in 8 days. You might as well organize the parade on July 14 tomorrow! No! If you transplant a heart to me, I want the best of hearts. I don't want a can, like I get like this. Can'te Vitale? Can'te Vitale Gold. I will prescribe you... ...a drug. A pschit to relieve you.

Tell your loved ones. Okay. Mimo... ... you tell no one that I have a month to live. I count on you. Of course. If I leave... May God preserve. ... I want a funeral of madness. The top funeral.

Gentlemen, Chief Rabbi. - Mr. Bensoussan? Come here. Mr. Bensoussan... ... the rabbinical court... ... cannot grant you that. You are asking for a too large sprain... ... to the major rule of Judaism. I cannot authorize you to make bar-mitzvahs for your son... ... 6 months before his 13th birthday. You're not going to do this to me. I lost my father the day of my bar mitzvah. I want to see my son become... ...a man. If you grant me this exemption... ... I put you on top of the rabbis. I... I pay what to pay. The amount you want. All of you, I'm passing you... ... chief rabbis. I am upgrading you. Up. Please. No! Calm down. What's the matter? Chloe just called me. She told me that... The Americans... What? They are in the United States. Mimo, spit it out. Bob Walker, the top of the event... ... he said no. Him too? American or not, I don't care. I'll do it all by myself.

I want the evening to go well. I want you to invent software for me... ... where, depending on the name of the guests... ... he places them so that it happens in relaxation. It's playable, but... ...

Honey, you need to sleep. Goodnight My Love. Tell me the story where Mimo saved your life. I've told you so many times already, honey. Please! Well. The story of Mimo who saved my life. It was happening in Morocco... ... on a beach called Les Sablettes. Dad was fishing for crabs. You know, like we do in Deauville. It was low tide... ... but the sea has risen. I said, "I'm going to drown!" A little boy saw me struggling. "Help! I'm going to drown!" He took me on the back, he swam. He saved my life. He had no family. Grandpa said, "We're going to adopt him." From Mauritius, it became Mimo. Is that why you never scold him? Papi Makhlouf, before dying, he said to me: ... "Mimo, it's like family. "You never abandon it." And your daddy has only one word. Dad, can you buy me a dog? No. I buy what you want, except a dog. Please. Come on, Bobby! Why did you call him Bobby? Because dad told me that in Morocco... ... all the dogs were called Bobby. It is true. Come here, Bobby! Put yourself there. Here, Bobby. Not on me. Come here. Bobby, no. Not my jacket. Go near Julia. Here. Not my jacket. Nardine amouk! L am an American! I'll give it to the Americans. I am not a myth. Even the Americans, they won't bring you that. Hold on. Two seconds. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... ... 7! I don't know what's going on, I see dwarfs everywhere. Not garden gnomes. Real dwarfs. They run and shout "Coco". COCO! COCO!

I am not informed. Not at all. Forget it. I I have... Hello? Shit! Send Agathe the top bouquets of flowers... ... with a word, like... "It will work out. There is something more serious in life." Okay, Mister Coco. I wanted to tell you... Chloe called. Mr. Lançon, the poor... ... the one who sells the corks... ... he died this morning. Shit! The poor. It pains me. So, Mimo... ... send... ... to Mr. Lançon's wife a beautiful crown... ... with writing: "Coco and" Frizz Easy "... "... unite with your pain." Okay. So, Coco? Mr. The Prefect, one day, you said to me: ... "If you need anything, come see me." Absolutely, Coco. I need anything. Ah. I'm listening to you. On June 13, I invite you to my son's bar mitzvah. How nice. Since it's a Sunday, people work the next day... ... and will not be able to stay until dawn. Now, I'm going to explode them. I want them to stay until dawn. Yes. What can I do? I would sort of, if you can... It would be... "holiday" the next day. To make... a holiday? To make it a holiday, what. It is a national commitment. We could "holiday" as the Paris region. Ah yes, just... If you do that... ...I pay! I will see what I can do for you. "Gonna get over you" (France Joli) ...- Have you chosen, Ms. Bensoussan? I take them all. All? All. All? All. Thank you.

I look forward. All. Sweetheart? I had crazy ideas! For the arrival of guests at the Stade de France... ... there is no old-fashioned photographer. A painter will immortalize each guest. A madness. Then the video is not the old-fashioned cameraman. I install 4000 cameras... ... so that everyone has their perception of the evening... ... depending on how he lived it. Gifts to guests. Do you want sugared almonds? No. Each guest will have a Smart with Smarties... ... and we go to them... Stop !! What is it, darling? What's the matter? You want to know?
