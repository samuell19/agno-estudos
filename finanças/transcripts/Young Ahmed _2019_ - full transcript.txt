YOUNG AHMED Where are you? We'll be late. We're two minutes away. Hurry and text me when you get here. This is wrong. A minus B... A squared minus 2 AB plus B squared. AB squared. That's it. Good. Let's see. Try this one. It could be in the exam. A minus B, times A plus B, equals A squared... - My brother. Got to go. - Wait. - Finish it. A squared... - Minus B squared. Minus B squared. Okay, you can go. Now Aniss... Ahmed! What about goodbye? - You still won't shake my hand? - Goodbye. Why do you go there? He told you not to shake my hand. - I'm not a child. - So? A true Muslim doesn't shake a woman's hand. Your classmates aren't true Muslims? No. Did you see that guy? He was acting serious, like. I can't learn my verses! Shut up, Rachid! - You have time. - Plus you're trying. I told my imam I'd know them. - They're read silently. - Relax. - He won't hear. - Allah will. Let me study. Can't we have a laugh? Give us a break. Chill. - It's insulting! - She can't make me! You shake your teacher's hand! - She knows it's not allowed. - Who by? Your imam? No, the Prophet. Take the couscous. Tell the Prophet your mom says to. - Don't make fun. - I'm not. Madam Inès helped with your dyslexia. Extra lessons every day. You read at five, so you shake her hand! She thinks I'm still five. She sees that imam brainwashing you. He makes you pray non-stop. - I want to. - Not true! Rachid, a table mat. A month ago, you played video games. You've taken down your posters. You won't wear short sleeves... It's that imam jerk. - Enough! - It's not true? - Don't insult him. - I will if I want. Ahmed won't be like your cousin. I don't want that. - You drunk. - What was that? Repeat that in French. Repeat it! - He said... - No, him! Repeat what you said. - He said stop drinking. - He didn't! I know what you said. Shame on you, saying that to me. - What's up? - He called me askarji. - Don't say that! - She drinks too much! Only a glass or two. He doesn't insult you! Apologize! - Apologize! - You dress like a slut. I dress how I want! Apologize! Let go of him! Stop it! Ahmed... - Ahmed. - I have to pray. Never say again what you said yesterday. I try to do my best. Give me a kiss. I've done my ablutions. Later. "Based on cultural heritage"? How? Songs in Arabic. Hits, she said. She's an apostate and a blasphemer too. Learning our Prophet's language in songs is blasphemy. Go to her meeting and say it's not allowed. - On Saturday. - It's better if a parent does it. Ahmed... I'll ask Driss' sister. Can you come? - What time? - Midday. No, my game's at 11. Rachid... Come here. Your game matters more than fighting a heretic? What is this bitch's goal? That we don't learn Arabic from the Qur'an. And our religion disappears. We'd merge with the Jews and Crusaders. Go to the meeting, brother. Help Driss' sister. I'm not good at speaking in public. I have information about her. Just say a few words. I'll be with you too. Mosque classes aren't good enough? I didn't say that. Mosque classes are good. I want to use songs to expand their vocabulary. It will teach them Arabic they can use in everyday life. You're not opposed to the Arabic learned in the Qur'an. I agree. Where did you learn Arabic? In the Qur'an, right? I know. You're right. But I can't always understand a manual or the news. I'm for Madam Inès' class at homework school, so our children can find jobs using modern Arabic. That's true. My brother works in Brussels, at a hotel where they need Arabic speakers. Madam... It's important they learn Arabic in the Qur'an. It teaches them respect for the Prophet's words. They must learn young, so it's ingrained. Thank you, brother. With the surah, they can pray. - Inch'Allah. - I agree. You learn Arabic to be a good Muslim. Travel and other stuff come later. It shouldn't prevent... Your class should be for those over 18. No, they must learn young, to speak it well. My sister... They learn in the Qur'an. That's not a good way? It is. But in Cairo, my sisters' kids learn at the mosque and at school. They talk about everything and read novels. Nearly everyone's Muslim there. Qur'an Arabic keeps our religion alive here. My class won't prevent them from attending the mosque one. It'll be at another time. They'll prefer your music to going to the mosque. - You exaggerate. - No. You do. As parents, we send them to the mosque and to Madam Inès. I'll do that with mine. I'll send them to both. The lady's right to say our religion will vanish. But, Madam Inès... - You don't care. - What do you mean? Explain yourself, Rachid. You don't care because your new boyfriend is a Jew. What do you mean, Ahmed? Ahmed, answer me! - Where is he? - At his second half. He's less pious, but he'll follow your example. Maybe, but he's scared. Bring me the step ladder. What if she gives her class? What would your cousin say to do? His motto. - Fight in the way of Allah... - In Arabic. Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you and slay them... ...wherever... ...wherever you catch them. She'd deserve that if the jihad were on. A French imam on the Net promotes martyrdom. He's wrong. After a defeat, we wait for new fighters. Two more packs, then I have a treat for you. - Another Abou Salah? - No, look. He's handsome. They added light to show he was at peace when he died. Be proud of your cousin. A pure man. Can you read it? And say not of those who are slain in the way of Allah, "They are dead." Nay, they are living... The apostate. She called me twice. Stay here. Ahmed! - She'd like to know... - I can talk to him. Can you step outside? Your impious words won't block Allah's way. Come on or your imam will hear. The Qur'an says we can live in peace with other religions. My father taught me that and he knew the Qur'an. The Qur'an says the Jews and Christians oppose us. No, he says that. No, the Qur'an. Surah 2, verse 120. Would you talk about the Qur'an with me? I can't read it with a woman. You prefer a lying imam? - He doesn't lie. - He does lie, Ahmed! He said you weren't here. But I saw your backpack. - He was protecting me. - From me? From your words against the mosque. Ahmed... Come on... I'll see you at homework school. We'll forget the mosque and handshakes. Will you come? I don't know. Is your Arabic class on? Yes, Wednesday at 2 pm. You'll be welcome. Goodbye. I need to pray. I'll join you. Yah Allah. Accept what I'll do for you. Come with me. Hello? Hello, it's Ahmed. I'd like to talk to you. Come on up. - You said she was an apostate... - I never said to kill her! But an apostate... When the jihad begins, I told you. Want the mosque closed and me deported? No. We'll go to the police or they'll say the mosque hid you. Hide me and then send me away. That needs preparation. The police will be at your place, and then come straight here. Come on. - They'll lock me up? - Only in a custody centre. You agree that what matters is protecting our mosque. Your brothers and sisters. Tell the police that all we do here is pray. An imam on the Net inspired you to attack her. The one promoting martyrdom. All right? You're in my heart and prayers. What's wrong? - Will they lock me up for long? - No. You're young. A month or two. When I get out, I'd like you to send me to Medina, to the same madrasa as my cousin. I promise I will. Be brave and pray as much as you can to be as close to Allah as this vein to your neck. - A note from your mom? - Yes. That's okay. I have to take the string. Can you remove it? Hello, Ahmed. May I have your toothbrush? Thanks. Arabic. We'll ask the philosophy adviser. I have to pray. At what time? In seven minutes. You'll be back. He's making pancakes next door. Bring the picture too. - You agree to see me now? - I have to. I'm glad anyhow. It's the call to prayer. "Prayer is better than sleep." It's okay. They're hadiths. No worries. You know some hadiths are unreliable? And others solid, I know. We can talk about that. We'll exchange our views. Nasser... Where are the scissors you used to open the milk? - On the table. - They've gone. Fouad, where did you put the scissors? - I gave them back. - No, you didn't. Everyone, on this side. We have to use the metal detector. Ask Franck to bring it. Come on. Fouad! You too, Ahmed. - I was with my caseworker. - Sorry, you were in here. - I have to pray. - It won't take long. - You have three minutes. - My ablutions! - Ahmed, come on. - My prayer. You'll do it after. All right, stop! - Let me pray. - Calm down! It's solitary next. Okay, solitary. Let's go. My prayer! We've found the scissors. - In the flour bag in the bin. - Hear that? We've found them. Calm down and you can pray in your room. Don't be afraid of Mira, she's a good dog. You can pet her. No, it's okay. Stay. They're three weeks old. Want to hold him? Go on, it's soft. No, it's okay. Your first job can be to feed them. That'd be good. The dog licked my hands. Can I wash? - Can't it wait? - No. My wife, Sandrine. Ahmed. Hello. Mira, sit. Leave Ahmed alone. He needs to wash his hands. In the dairy or the house. Let's go to the house. I'll show you where to pray. Mira, stay! We've made room here. You can put down your mat. Will it do? Yes. The bathroom. It's this door. The light's on the right. Mr Diouri put them on plates for you. Are they good? Yes. Want one? No, they're for you. This second visit is harder than the first. Come closer. - Will you take part in activities? - No. - You went to the farm? - I won't go back. Why not? They're too nice. I don't like it. - You'd prefer them to be nasty? - Yes. Did you speak to the psychologist? No. Did Rachid say anything? He sends his love. Yasmine too. Madam Inès came over and asked if you'd see her. What for? She says it'd help her understand. She still has her Arabic class? Yes. It could help you understand too. I don't want to talk to her. Because she teaches Arabic? Your brother testified against the imam. What did he say? That he fired you up by saying she was an apostate... - He never said that! - Stop defending him. Don't be scared. They arrested him. - Rachid lied. - No. Inès found someone else who said the same. Tell the truth about the imam. If you change, it'll be easier for you. I already did. Ahmed... I wish you could be like before. If your dad was here... It's not that. We'd have fought. Why say that? He gave in. I don't. - He never gave in... - He gave in! If not, you'd wear a hijab and never drink. - Yasmine too... - Shut up! Say that again and I won't come back. I've got no tissues. Mom... You have to change, Ahmed. I can't believe it's true. I can't sleep. Keep going! Go, Ahmed! Lengthen your stride! You're nearly there. Ready, Yannis. Speed up. Come on, Ahmed! Go, Yannis! You okay? 24 seconds 10. Not bad for a first try. Will they have me back at the farm? Hold on, I only called 15 minutes ago. Move as you catch your breath. I'm glad you've left your room. Another relay? What time is it? 4:24 pm. Do like me. Loosen up your arms. 25/7/2018... 7:10 pm. You know the number. 0487... 29 20 50. Hello? This is Ahmed's caseworker. - Are you his mother? - Yes. He'd like a word. - You can't put anyone else on. - I know. Here he is. Hello? Are you okay, Mom? I'm still at the store. The delivery only just arrived. - Are you okay? - Yes. I've thought about what you said about Madam Inès. I agree to see her. I spoke to the psychologist. She wants to see me twice first. Mom? Yes. I'm happy to hear that. Can you call back in 15 minutes? They need me. No, I'm not going to call back. See you on Sunday. Call back anyway if you want. Lots of love. Goodbye. - I'm going now. - Yes. I've finished. That's good, Ahmed. Ahmed, come with me. The last one together. Come on. Try to guide him. Put yourself by the wall. That's it. He'll go now. Give him a push. Come on. Louise, open the gate. Okay, push him, don't be afraid. Go on, Louise. - Are the boots okay? - Yes. Get the milk heater and put it in the bucket. This? Yes, that's it. Is it set to 38°C? Yes. Why 38°? The temperature in the mother's udder. A few minutes and it'll be ready. Did you ask Dad to tie the dog up 'cause you're scared? No. So why? I don't like her licking me. Her saliva's impure. - Your religion says that? - Yes. Nearly ready. You can pet him. He's sweet. Look. Look, the bucket's empty. Watch this. He's suckling, he's still hungry. Ahmed! You're going? Yes. Goodbye. No goodbye kiss? - See you Wednesday? - Wednesday. You were with the calves when she called. - What did I do wrong? - Nothing. A psychologist doesn't work that way. She thinks you don't realize what meeting your victim means. It's postponed till when? Till she thinks you're ready. Understanding takes time. You tried to kill. Your cousin lied, death is more than a mosquito bite. Does music bother you? No. Two weeks ago, it would have. Yes, but I'm changing. Only the psychologist doesn't see it. Unfold your mat, please. Fine, thanks. Okay, you can go. It's ten o'clock. Shutters closed. Lights out. Time for bed. Good evening, Ahmed. - Everything okay? - Yes. - You'll wake for your prayer? - Yes. Good night. "N'a" is just like "na". The apostrophe isn't pronounced. Good. Nassad, note that, please. You can carry on from here. "Il... - "pale...” - "Parle". With an "r". - "...tourc." - "Turc". No "o". "Elle ne... "parle... "pass... "tourc... turc." Ahmed, tell him for "pas”. The "s"... The "s" remains silent. Write it on the board, please. Note it in your book. Yes. Ahmed has the psychologist. You can go, Ahmed. Thank you. Think she'll agree? It depends what you say. - Ahmed's here. - Just a minute. She's on the phone. Good luck. See you later. Sir... Can't you stay to tell her I've changed? You have to show her that. Not me. I'll see you later. You told me that before. Remember what I said? No. I told you, you don't meet your victim just to make your mom happy. It's not just that. What else then? Maybe it'll help me understand what I did. All right... But your mom said that. That it could help you. You said so. But I think that too. It's not just my mom. That's good. You agree to meet Madam Inès as it may help you. It's a good reason. But I don't think you're ready. Why not? Why do you think? I don't know. Madam Inès says it could help her to see me. Why refuse? Repeat the beginning. Madam Inès says it could help her... You never put yourself in your victim's shoes before. That's a change, Ahmed. Yah Allah. Help me carry out what I offer you, as ordered by your Prophet. Peace be upon him. Amen. Hello. - A problem? - No. I need my pen so I can study. It's too early for the lights. I can see well enough. Just a second. Mom, forgive me for the hurt I'll do you. Try to be a true Muslim and you'll be proud of me. Ahmed Abou Salah Hello. Here you go. Step forward. A bit further. Stop. Spread your legs. Your arms too. Palms to the front. Lean forward. I'll search you. Gentlemen. Hello, Ahmed. - Are you okay? - Yes. I spoke to the judge. If it goes well, they'll transfer you next month. I'll tell him you're here. Just a second, sir. Can you give my mother this list of food for Sunday? Yes. Ahmed is here. Hello, Ahmed. Madam Inès will come later so you don't meet in the hallway. Hello. - Your Honour. - Sit down, please. - Let's go. - May I use the bathroom? - Yes, last door on the left. - Thank you. You teach another youngster. That's good. - Your sports instructor... - Ms. Touzani is here. All right. If you no longer want to... Ahmed. If you no longer want to see Ms. Touzani, just say so and we cancel. No, it's okay. Hello, ma'am. Follow me, please. It's okay. It doesn't matter. Let's go in here. I'll call your psychologist. Talk about her reaction. It'll help you realize what you did to her. - Do you understand? - Yes. Will she agree to see me? She said she'd oall me. When she does, I'll set up a date with the team. Can we talk about Bryan for tomorrow? Yes, just a second. You can go. I'll see you soon. - Gentlemen. - Goodbye. Keep up the activities. Every youngster says the farm helped a lot. - See you soon. - Goodbye. May I use the bathroom? It's a long drive. - Yes. - Thank you. I need to see my lawyer. May I? Go on. Excuse me. May I have that note for my mother? I'll tell her by phone. Of course. - Here. - Thank you. Ahmed, you do the lever. Open it more. That's good. Rest it on the mudguard. Hold on, I'll climb in. One, two, three... Half-full, he said? I'll turn off the tap. I'll go. Can you take the hose? I'm driving the tractor. Want to come with me? And my caseworker? He'll follow in the jeep with my dad. I'll ask my caseworker. Can I take the tractor with Louise? Okay, but not without us. No, we'll wait. Ahmed. Your prayer's in ten minutes. I'll take my Qur'an and my mat. I'll pray there. It's 20 minutes away. We'll stop. Not on the main road. We'll join them by car. Or skip your prayer. I'll say we'll go later. - Want some cake? - No thanks. Sure? It's apple. Your glasses suit you. Have you had them long? Since I was four or five, I think. Can you take them off? Why? Just to see. Look at me. I like you without them too. Look at me again. - Without glasses. - Why? Come on, please. Am I hazy? A little. Do you prefer me hazy or clear? I don't know. I prefer myself hazy. Like in a dream. Can I have your glasses to see you hazy? May I? Lcok at me. Ahmed, I want to kiss you. What is it? Nothing. Want to see the work in the beet field? If you want. Can I show Ahmed the work to do in the beet field? - Where is it? - Just there. All right. I'm trusting you. If we don't pull them up, the seeds fall and we'll have a field of wild beets next year. - Don't the cows eat them? - No, we ditch them. Here's one. They're not ripe yet. They're green, still firmly attached. Kiss me. Go, if you don't want to. If you stay, you're willing, but don't dare to. Ever done it? What? Kiss. No. Open your mouth. Yah Allah, I have erred. I promise I won't do it again. I hate my sins as I hate going to hell. Come in. I'm glad you came to say goodbye. I was waiting for you. See you on Wednesday. Bye. What's wrong? You know, since the first day you came, I've felt something for you. And you? I wanted to ask if you'd agree to become a Muslim. What we did in the field, I can't do that. It's a sin with a Muslim girl, but with you it's worse. If I forced you, forgive me. Never mind. It's too late. If you become a Muslim, my sin won't be so bad. I'll have snapped before marrying. You understand? Ahmed! Just a second! I just tried to pray. I can't do it. I feel I'm impure. Not a true Muslim anymore. We didn't do anything wrong. I did. So, will you? If I say no, you'll feel nothing more for me? Yes. Bye then. Goodbye. Till Wednesday. Goodbye, Ahmed. Can I say goodbye to Louise? - You didn't yet? - No. - Can I ask where she is? - Go on. Where's Louise? In the hayloft. Can I go? Hurry. Why not become a Muslim if you feel something for me? - You accept? - No. Why not? I won't be forced. You'd keep me out of heaven? Not at all. Heaven doesn't exist. - Infidel! - Get the hell out! I'm too hot. - Open your window. - I'm okay. Ahmed! Ahmed! I respect my homework school. Mom... Ahmed? Ahmed, are you okay? Can you hear me? Yes. I'll call an ambulance. Madam Inès... Madam Inès... Please forgive me. Please forgive me. I'll call an ambulance.
