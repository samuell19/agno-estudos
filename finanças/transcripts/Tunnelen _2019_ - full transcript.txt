The kids walk around and look at everything and are happy. - Did you hear that the storm was taking the Christmas tree? - No? Hello. It was Christian. Have you talked to Elise? No. It was so stressed last week. Now it's only two days left. Just drop it. It is fine by me. - I like to be alone. - Not on Christmas Eve. I want you to be there. I'll take it with Elise tonight. Sure something has happened here. I have to hang up. We talk. Skjeggkre? No, I do not think so. I had not sold an apartment if I knew it was comfy. Hi! You get me out on the road again, right? You can't drive past when there is a column across the valley. Oh, that was column? I'm bad time. Must reach the Christmas ending. - Hi. Are you okay? - Yes. Can't you just pull me out? How much do you need for it? I don't have time for that. But I can call for salvage truck. - Nice. - You are here at your own risk. Right. But how long does it take? Double guard. Have you never been free? Andrea has reported moving here. Only paperwork remains. - Someone has to keep up with Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Drive carefully. - Take a gingerbread.

I'm not sure. OK. We take it easy. The tunnel is nine kilometers long. Did you drive in from the east or west? Tom, do you see an emergency phone or a fire extinguisher? - If you take it down, I see where you are. - I drove in from the field. - I'm trying to get a wagon train past. - No, don't let anyone pass. Hello! Do you hear me? What are you doing? It's not my car! Turn! They are driving. I try again. Yes, try to get around me. I've closed the tunnel, but lost contact with the driver. - Do you know where he stands in the tunnel? - Two to three kilometers in from the east. - There could be more. - I alert the ambulance and the police. - Is it column driving? - No. An accident has probably happened. - Then we will be sitting here for Christmas. - One fat for me. We stand out and see what happens. - Don't we have a camera in the tunnel? - No. Only one webcam at exit east at the column boom. VTS. Egil Ramsvik. Yes. The Storfjell tunnel is closed. We have no record of the extent of the accident. Tom, are you there? Marius, he drove in east at 12.11. When was the accident reported? - We got message 12:14. - Three minutes later.

According to the contingency plan it's Stange's responsibility. - It's a hell of a weather on the east side. - Then we'll be the first person up. She needs you to talk to her. I try but don't get it. Yes, you will. - You made it with me. - It was just luck. - Christian. - He really needs to talk to you. - No. - Give it to you, then. - Stone. - You're not giving up. The Relief Corps needs you. A tanker truck has been running in the wall. - One new message. - Hey, Elise. It's dad. It's not me who decides everything. We are. I lock myself in now. Hello. I'm not getting any signal. - It must be an accident. - Can't we just hike out? - Hi Dad. - Hi. - Don't have a Christmas break? - It's me who called him in. We need the best at work now. Our mission is to get a fire truck up to the tunnel. I've talked to the police. They are at least one hour away. We are not waiting for them. Have you talked to Stange Fire Department? But are they informed? The Road Traffic Center called me. I do as they have requested. Ivar! This is a rescue situation. I have the command. Stein, you're driving a car. - Where's the rest of the crew? - It's vacation. It's just us. If it gets serious up there, I need you. Touch you. If it is column queue, it blows really up the hill.

On the east side. - What is it? - Someone just took a fire extinguisher. - On the west side? Is it burning? - No. The fire ventilation goes automatically, when someone takes a fire extinguisher. - Burning it, the sensors show it. - OK. It doesn't burn. I want to know exactly where that tanker stands. Yes? That is right. Come on, Tom. Hi, Marius. The fire ventilation was just activated. - Is it long until Stange is up? - I need to hear. Hold line. We had to help a guy who had driven off the road. We'll fix this. I need to fix it. Yes, you say something there. - I want brown Christmas soda! - Now it's red Christmas noise. Which expert did you talk to? Was it the pest control? OK. How many such wall gear found you? 3-4 pieces? OK. But do you know what we are doing now? You know what... - I want brown Christmas soda. - Now Joseph is drinking that shower. And then God will hear nothing more about Christmas noise. It'll be fine. - Looks like they're struggling. - A damn vintage car ticket. Christian? Have you heard from the road traffic control center? No not yet. Back as a rescuer now. Why did you quit?

Get in the cars. - Everyone on the bus! - It was no good. - What was that sound? - Get in the bus, everyone. Stay in the seats. Run! - Hello? Can anyone hear me? - Why don't you ride the bus? - I can't turn around here. - Then do something! - You have to wait here. - Listen to her! She is right! - The smoke is deadly! - We're dying! Can anyone hear us? There is fire in the tunnel. What's that? - Is it smoke? - Yes. Impact on several sensors. - The tanker? - Probably, but I don't know. Wait. There are multiple sensors in tunnel. Both to the east and west. - So it's burning now? - No doubt. I turn on the air ambulance, but how high is the tunnel? 950 meters above sea level. Stange Fire Department is coming not enter. - What's up? - They don't come up on the east side. The press is calling me down. I need to know what to say. - Road traffic central west. - We stand in the Storfjelltunnel ... What do they say? It burns in a car further in. So that's fine. We have to turn on recycling, and so on let's get out of here. Is it dangerous? No, it's fine. It's okay. Mom, look! OMG! - No, fuck, shut the door! - He's burning. We must...

I will. Be careful, Stein. - Damn. What happened? - A tanker truck. I go and hear with them. - What should I do? - Open the emergency control cabinet. The crew from Vik is here on the west side. - Håkon! Crowbar! - Coming! - Are there more inside the tunnel? - I have no idea. So nothing. - There's a lot of people in there. - You have to come in and help them. We have to. Take care he who comes there. There are a lot of people inside the tunnel. Are the fans going? Fire ventilation is activated heading west. Against us? According to the contingency plan, it should evacuated from Stange. - Entrance east. - They sit on all the equipment. - Are they in place? - There has been a race in the countryside. They are working their way through it now. - And on this site is just us? - Yes. - Are you getting the emergency network? - I can't get in touch. - It never worked here. - Turn the fan direction, then we go in.

No! No! Dad! Dad! Dad? - Stone! - Dad! Stone? Stone? OK. OK. Lift him up. Are you okay? OK. Up with him. Where is Ivar? Ivar? Ivar? - Dad. - Ivar. Dad, come on. - Dad, come on! - Stein, we have to get out now! Come! The road is there even if you don't see it. Stay focused and steady, otherwise you get stuck. No one is calling anymore. - I was so scared. - Got it. It goes well. - We're not in the tunnel. - It's in the news all the time. We didn't get that far. I did not take the chance to cross the mountain. No one lights his lamp and squeeze door. Closed are all hearts and doors for us in Bethlehem. There are some who will talk to you. - That's Stein. - Hey, Stein. Did you get the girls out? Wait. Hello. There is one who would very much like to talk to you. Sara, is that you? It was good to hear. Yes, yes. Come. Dad. Come. Text: Jørn-Are Haugli Johansen Scandinavian Text Service
