Is there anything else I can help you with? - No, it's. - Okay, then you're gonna have to leave. You can't loiter here.

I was just in the music store and I heard you playing. You're incredible. What's your name? - Um, Will. - It's nice to meet you, Will. I'm Ken Donovan. It's all right. How long have you been playing? - [Will] Just today. - You started playing today? That's funny, but where do rehearse or practice? I don't wanna sound rude, but you're homeless, aren't you? - Yeah. - I got an idea. I'm throwing a party Friday night at my house. I already hired a pianist, but I'd much rather have you play. Hey, Will, there's gonna be a lot of people there who'd love to hear you play. Will, I'm trying to offer you a job. - What? - I was gonna pay the other pianist $600 to play for the night. - So you wanna pay me to play piano? - [Ken] Yes, yes. - $600? - Will, be at this address Friday night at seven o'clock. (Tense music) - Yeah, seven o'clock, Friday night, yeah, okay. - Will, will, what are you gonna wear? - This is all I got really, this-- - Here, come here, come here, come here. Listen, take this. Take this and get a shirt, some shoes, and some pants, okay?

(Bicycles squeak) (swings squeak) (muffled laughing) (water splashing) - Will, hey. - Hey. - Where you been, man? - Just doing my thing, you know, and just, how's business been? - It's, it's good, it's been kinda crazy the last couple of months, but finally making a little money. You all right, man? You don't look so good. - I just, uh. - Oh, I know what you need. - No, I um, I don't do that anymore. - Come on, it'll be just like old times. - No, I'm good. - Are you?

You can't do this. - [Will] I don't have an address. - What do you want? - Something happened to me.

Who's that? - [Carrie] It's nobody, baby. Come on, let's get back into bed. Mommy, will be right back. I'm going outside for just a second. - That's not why I'm here, okay. - Then why are you here? Do you need me to take you to the hospital? - No. - You don't have anybody, friends? Oh my God. All right, you can come in, but if you hurt my daughter, I swear to God, I will kill you. - She's my daughter too. - No, let's get one thing straight, okay, when you chose that life, you gave up everything. Just because you helped make a baby does not make you a father. You got it? We don't need you. - I know. - Okay. Do you still drink tea? Here, come in. (Slow gentle music) I almost didn't recognize you with that beard. - Oh, it's still me. - [Carrie] There you go. - Thank you. - So what happened? You don't wanna tell me. - I don't want you to think I'm crazy. - So you had nowhere else to go and you're here, and you're still not gonna tell me what happened? Are you gonna tell me anything? - I, I gotta job. - You did? - It's just a one day thing. - What kind of work is it? - Playing the piano. - You don't play piano. - I know. (Dramatic piano music) - Hey, I guess you do play piano. (Door clatters) Oh, shoot, I'll be right back. Are you ever gonna tell me what happened? - Lightning, I was struck by lightning. - What? - [Annie] Mommy? - Oh, I'll be right back. Here baby, you gotta get back in bed.

But you can stay on the couch tonight. But tomorrow you gotta go, okay. But let's get coffee and then you can tell me more about what happened. - Yeah? - Yeah. It's really good to see you're turning things around. So, goodnight. - Hey, Carrie, thank you. - Oh, goodnight. (Slow gentle music) (ominous music) - Jeez! (Startling music) (unsettling music) (menacing whispering) - [Ghost] Shh. - What are you doing? What do you think you're doing? - I was just, I was just checking on her. - Will, I am trusting you. Don't make me regret this. I know that you miss her, but this is not okay. Good. Good night. (Piano clangs) - Hi. - Leave him alone, Annie. Here you go. You gotta blow on it. Now go get your backpack. Well, I'm going to work, but you don't have to leave right now. But I'd kinda like it if you weren't here when I got back. There's some coffee over there if you want some. - Do you have a computer? - I do, but the screen on it is broken. I've been saving up for a new one. I usually just use my phone. But the library is, well, you know. Let's still get that coffee sometime though, okay? (Tender piano music) Okay, Annie, we better go. All right, um, bye. (Uneasy music) - Hey, asshole, get the hell away from my car. - Great, thank you very much, and Dr. Norman will see you in about 10 minutes. - [Patient] Okay. - Okay. (Delicate piano music) - Uh, hi, excuse me, can I help you? - No, that's okay. - Um, you're not allowed to just hang out here. - No, I actually wanted to get some books on music and then use the internet to do some research on computer repair. (Knocking on door) - Come on in. - Dr. Norman? - One second. Hey, what's going on? - I don't mean to be bothering you, but I was just wondering if you had a moment for a medical question? - [Doctor] Sure. - Do you have any experience with patients who've been struck by lightning? - By lightning? Wow, I gotta think about that one. Lightning, actually I did have a guy years ago in the emergency room got hit by lightning, left an awful scar. I remember that very clearly. The scar, it's actually called the Lichtenberg figures. It's very, very odd. Let me look that up for ya. Okay, I think I found it, here it is. Take a look at that. - Oh, wow. - So what's going on? - Oh, um, my friend, he said that it happened to him and I was wondering if you had any experience with it. - Well, they call Tampa the lightning capital of the world, so we do hear about it. But you know, has the guy seen a doctor? - I don't think so, no. - Really? - [Carrie] Mm mmm. - He really should, yeah. I got a good friend of mine who's a neurologist. He'd be perfect for that. - Oh, really? - Yeah, he's a great guy and we refer patients back and forth for many, many years, so I'll write down his number. Let me look that up right now for you. And if he needs to get seen, definitely get him over there. - Yeah. - There you go. And take that, tell him I referred you over. I mean, it could be a pretty important thing for him to go get seen. - Yeah, I can imagine. - Yep, I hope everything works out. - [Carrie] Thank you. - Absolutely. - Yeah, thanks. - Sure, do I need to go over those charts? - Oh, yeah, these are for you. - All right. - Okay, thank you, Dr. Norman. - Thank you, oh, you're welcome. (Gripping music) (unsettling music) (menacing whispering) (speaking in foreign language) (tense music) - Are you okay? - Are you real? - Excuse me? - Are you real? - Is there somebody I can call for you or somewhere you can go? - I'm fine. - So how was school, babe? Annie? - What? - [Carrie] How was school. - Okay. - So I was thinkin', maybe we visit grandma and grandpa tonight. - Is that okay with grandma? - Yeah, and guess what they're having for dinner? - What? - Pizza. ♪ I'm a man named Melchizedek ♪ ♪ He was a good man, a good man ♪ ♪ Roaming lonely in the desert ♪ ♪ He invited me to stay ♪ ♪ Said I would learn to love this space ♪ ♪ I know a woman name was Jezebel ♪ ♪ She was a wild one, a wild one ♪ ♪ She said come on, we can have fun ♪ ♪ And then she wanted me to go ♪ ♪ She couldn't stand getting too close ♪ ♪ And I'm curious who I'll meet next ♪ ♪ Who among them I will love best ♪ ♪ That depends upon the context ♪ ♪ Doesn't it, doesn't it ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, ooh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, ooh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, ooh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, ooh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, ooh ♪ (laptop chimes) - [Carrie] Will. - Oh, I, sorry, I know you said shouldn't be here. - No, it's okay. - I know you said I shouldn't. - No, it's okay, really. - Um, I fixed your computer. - What? - Yeah, screen, it works now. - [Carrie] Are you serious? - Take a look.

Get off, Will, get off of me, dude. - [Will] Don't have it? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Is that a friend of yours? - Not anymore. And dinner is on me. (Both laugh) - Hey folks, how're we doing tonight? - Good. - Good, good, can I get you started off with something to drink, maybe some wine perhaps? - I'm okay with water, maybe you can have-- - Uh, no, I'm good with water too, thanks. - Would you like a couple of more minutes with the menu? Are we all set and ready to order? - Um, how 'bout you give us just a couple more minutes. - Fine, not a problem, take your time. ♪ We are the ones to pretend ♪ ♪ But we are the ones to never give in ♪ ♪ No matter what the world throws at us ♪ ♪ You'll always have me ♪ ♪ And I have you ♪ ♪ I have you ♪ - Look, I just, I want you to know that-- - You don't have to. - What? - I mean, you don't have to say anything. - Look, I wanted to be the man that you wanted me to be, okay, I did, I just-- - It's okay, it's okay. I'm fine, Annie's fine, we're happy. - Can you believe we're here? - Why, 'cause we used to come here? - No, no. Right here, right now, all the people that there are in the world right, do you know how many people there are in the world? - I don't know, a couple billion? - There are 7.5 billion people in the world, okay? And we are right here, we are right now, right? Amongst everybody in all the restaurants, we're in the same restaurant, we're in the same state, the same country, the same universe amongst billions of stars, right? If you calculated the odds of the chances of us being in the same place, the same time, I mean. - Kinda like the odds of being struck by lightning? - Exactly. - You're different. - Is that a bad thing? - It's just different. - I guess we're always evolving at different various degrees of celerity, right? - Who are you? What, what do you-- - I'm sorry, do you, do you see that? - See what? - The woman in the parking lot? - I don't see a woman. What, Will, what's wrong? - Did you get a chance to look at our dessert menu by chance? - I'm sorry, we need, we need a minute. - Yeah, definitely. - Sorry. - Will, what's going on, what's wrong? - I keep seeing these, I don't know, I keep seeing these things. - Well, what things? - I don't know, I can't tell if they're real. I can't tell if I'm going crazy. I didn't wanna tell you because I didn't want you to think that I'm-- - No, hey, hey, I still care about you. I mean, I know you're not crazy. I made an appointmnet at a neurologist for tomorrow. And I thought that maybe he could give us some answers. And it's no big deal, it's a friend of my boss'. We don't even have to pay anything. What? - I'm sorry, behind you over there, do you see a, do you see a man sitting at the table by any chance? I mean, don't make a, wait, don't make it, try not to make it obvious though. - I do see him. But that doesn't mean that you're, you wanna get outta here? - [Will] Yeah. - [Carrie] Come on. (Slow gentle music) (eerie music) - What Will? What is it? - [Will] Sorry, I, uh-- - No, no, no, no, don't, don't be sorry. It's okay. It's okay. (Slow unsettling music) (startling music) - What do you want from me? Answer me! - Will, it's me, please stop! (Slow reserved music) - I should, I should go. - No. - No, I shouldn't be here, this isn't your problem. - Will, no. I should've been there for you. - It's not your fault. - I told you to leave 'cause I wanted you know what you were losing, but, we should've worked through it together. - Carrie, it's-- - I don't wanna do that again. 7.5 billion people, right? - [Will] Yeah. - Will. - [Will] Mm. - What time is it? - Between 9:30 and 9:35. - How do you know that? - Use the placement of the sun. - Okay, smart guy. We gotta get you to your appointmnet. - [Will] Mm mmm. - [Carrie] Mm hmm. - Do you have a cell phone I could use? - Yeah, let's see. Here, you get that. - Thank you. - Who you callin'? - Hi, Mr. Donovan, it's Will. How are you? From the music store. Yes, sir, I am definitely still coming tonight. Is it the address on the card? You have a pen? A pen I could? - [Carrie] Oh, yeah. - Yeah, let me go ahead and repeat that back to you. It's over the Tom Stuart Causeway, left on Bayshore, then an immediate right on North Redington, it's gonna be the third house on the left, gate code is #346715. I'm good, it's okay, I got it. One more quick question, Mr. Donovan, is it okay if, um, my, my girlfriend comes? No, sir, she lives in a house, yes. Yes, sir. I can do that. I'll see you tonight, bye. You wanna go to a party tonight? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. (Both laugh) (knocking on door) - Come in. Hi. - Hi, we have an 11 o'clock appointmnet. - Right on time. - I'm Carrie. - Oh, sorry (chuckles). - Nice to meet you. - Hi, nice to meet you. Must make you Will. - Yes, sir. - Oh, please call me Noah. Come on in guys, have a seat. - Okay, thanks. - So struck by lightning, hm. When'd it happen? - Three days ago. - Did you go to a hospital? - No, sir, did nothing, I didn't go to a doctor. - So I'm the first doctor you've seen? All right, so what are we dealing with here? How've you been feeling since it happened? - I have these bad headaches. Um, seeing things that's not there. - Seeing things? What kinds of things? - Mostly people. - Really, what kind of people? - And tell him about the other stuff. - I can do things that I wasn't able to do before. - What does that mean? - Like he can play piano, he can fix laptops, he can look out the window and tell what time it is. - And you couldn't do any of those things before? - [Will] Mm mmm. - Hmm. Carrie, would mind giving Will and I just a couple of minutes? I wanna run him through some cognition tests. And I just wanna make sure he's not distracted. - Oh, yeah, yeah, are you okay? - Yeah. - Okay. - Thanks. All right, Will, I'd like to start out by checking your eidetic memory, okay? So what I'm gonna have you do is look at this card for five seconds. It's got all the digits of pi on it. I'd like you to memorize as many as you can. You ready? - 3.14159 2653589793 23846264 338327950 28841971. - How, how'd you do that? - I saw the card when you were sittin' down. I, uh, I passed, I guess? - Uh, well, it's not really a pass or fail kind of test. Most people can memorize about seven digits. Hey, you ever see one of these? - Yeah. - Do you know what it is? - Yeah, it's a Rubik's Cube. - You know how it works? - Um, I think so. You're supposed to make every side a different color. - Right, wanna give it a shot? - Not particularly. - Come on. Mind if I time you? - For what? - [Noah] And. - Aren't these supposed to be-- - [Noah] Go! That's amazing. What's wrong? (Startling music) What is it? Are you okay? Hey, it's okay. - I'm sorry, I. Can we go? - [Carrie] Yeah, yeah, of course. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah. - Look, I need to be honest, I've never seen anything like this before. And I just think that the more we understand what's going on, the better help we can be for him. So how soon can you bring him back? - Oh, well, maybe tomorrow, but it's really up to him. - I get that, but you need to understand that we need to start thinking about what's best for him, okay? I'm just sayin'. - Yeah, well, I'll talk to him. Will! - What? - What is wrong, what happened in there? - I'm messed up, all right? That's what happened. - You're not messed up. - This isn't how things were supposed to go. It was supposed to be different, my. - [Carrie] Will, you're not messed up. - Yes, I am, okay. - No, you're not. We're gonna fix it, okay. We're gonna fix all of it. I mean, that's why we're here. - I think it'd be better if you, if you just stayed away from me, all right? (Slow reserved music) - Do you remember our first date? - What are you bringing up our first date for? - Everything went wrong, like everything went wrong. Good things came from that. I mean, it's the same with this. And I'm gonna be here with you through the whole thing. Also, kinda wanna do something fun. And I think you could use it. (Slow tender music) (Annie laughs) - [Annie] Tag. - Oh, boy. You ready for, uh, I got an idea. You ready? What do you think if we team up and get Mommy? - I'm not playin'. - [Will] Oh, yes you are. Let's get her. (Annie and Carrie laugh) I need to save you. One, two. (Carrie screams) - You got me. You tired? - [Will] I'm tired. - [Carrie] It's getting kinda late. We're gonna stay at grandma and grandpa's tonight, okay? - [Annie] Okay. - [Carrie] We got a big party that we're gonna go to. - [Annie] But I wanna stay with you. - [I know, baby. I'd bring you with me if I could. But I'm gonna come get you first thing tomorrow, okay? - Can we come back tomorrow? - Can we? - Yeah. - Thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you. (Delicate piano music) - I'm almost ready. Does it look okay? - You're perfect. - I got my clutch, my keys. - Hey. I'm not gonna mess up again. - I know. We gotta go. - Yeah. - Ready? You okay? - Yeah. (Knocking on door) - Hello, can I help you? - Hi, I'm Will, this is Carrie. We're here for the party. - Sorry, this is a private party. - Okay. - Did you wanna call him? - Will, you made it. Look at you, I wouldn't have recognized you. And who is this? - Hi, I'm Carrie. - Hello, Carrie, I'm Ken Donovan. Welcome. - You have a lovely home. - Thank you very much. Would you like to see the inside of it, or are you more comfortable outside? I'm just kidding Will, it was a joke. Come on in, welcome, welcome. - [Carrie] Thank you. - Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention for a moment? First of all, thank you for coming and I hope you're enjoying yourselves because tonight we have a very, very special treat for everyone. I met this man earlier in the week. He was without a job, living on the streets, and abusing drugs. But now, he's gonna show you what's possible when someone reaches their full potential. You see, he has a gift, and he's gonna share that gift with us this evening. So without any further adieu, please enjoy the musical stylings of piano prodigy, Will. (Guests applaud) (piano keys clang) ("Toccata" by Sergey Prokofiev) - Excuse me, sir, Mr. Donovan would like to see you. - Well, sure. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good, I'm okay. - I'll be right back. - Will, I'm so glad you're here. Probably wondering why I asked you here. I just wanted to make sure you get paid for that amazing performance, truly a masterful performance. - Thank you. - But you've gotta be honest with me, Will, how long have you been playing? - Not long at all. - Really? - [Will] Yeah. - (Chuckles) Okay, let's go ahead and get you paid. (Tense music) - Um, excuse me, my boyfriend, he's the guy who's the piano, someone took him to go see Mr. Donovan, and we really have to get going. Is there any way you could get him for me? - Let me see what I can do. - Okay, thank you. - What the hell are you doing? - Relax, Will, this will only take a second. - You can't just do this to me, okay. Help, help! - Calm down, Will, I need you to calm down and cooperate. I don't wanna hurt you. - Look, just, just let me go. - Hold is arm. - Stop, stop, stop, just listen to me, listen. - All right, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the party is over for tonight. Mr. Donovan would like to thank you all for coming out And have a good night, get home safe. - I'm just gonna go get my boyfriend so that we can go. - You're not allowed back there. - I'm just gonna go and get my boyfriend so that we can go. - I can't let you do that. - Look, why are you doing this? - You know, Will, I'm disappointed in you. I would've thought now you would've learned to use the gift. - What gift? - The gift I gave you. - You did this to me? No, I was struck by lightning, okay. - (Laughs) Can you really believe everything that happened that night? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Oh, come on Will, don't embarrass me. I hand selected you from several other candidates for a human drug trial. - Human trial for what? - Celtrite, the drug that'll take us to the next step of evolution. The ability to double and triple the brain's capacity to learn. And you are living proof it works. - You see, it doesn't work, okay? I'm having headaches, I'm seeing these, I see these things, I'm changing, okay. It doesn't work. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know about the side effects and all that, Will, and I'm working on that. But now I've got a sample of your blood so I can continue my research. Will, come on, you should be thanking me. Do you realize how much people are gonna pay to have what you have? (Knocking on door) - [Roger] Sir? - I'm busy. - Sir, the girl he came with is causing a scene. I think you need to come speak to her. - What am I paying you for? (Tense music) Come on, let's go. - You're not real. (Dramatic music) (gun clicks) (case clicks) - Get your hands off me! - [Carrie] Let go! - Excuse me, excuse me. Is everything okay? - No, this guy won't let me through. - He's just doing his job. There are certain areas of the house which are off limits to the guests. - Where's Will? - Will wasn't feeling well, so he has to lay down. - Well, he was fine a second ago. Where is he? - He said he was getting migraines. Actually, he says it happens quite often, which is understandable for an addict. - He's not an addict. Where is he? I wanna see him. - Oh, I don't think so. But I can assure you, we'll get him home safely. Roger, show her to the door. - Absolutely. - No, wait, Will! - Get your hands off of her. (Tense music) - Will, this is just a big misunderstanding. Now drop the gun and let's talk about this. - We're not gonna talk, okay? We're gonna leave. You let her go. (Gun fires) Carrie! No! (Gun fires) - (grunts) Anybody got anything to say, huh? Good. Now clean this up, I'm going to bed. (Gentle guitar music) - [Announcer Of Ad] Are you feeling tired, depressed, alone, or helpless?
