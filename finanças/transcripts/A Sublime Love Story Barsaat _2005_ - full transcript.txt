We are going so fast. Aren't you scared? I'm enjoying it all the more now. When you are with me... I'm not scared at all, In fact, this is great fun! Watch it. You're going to be really scared now what are you looking at? I feel like giving you a kiss. - So give me a kiss Close your eyes first whenever you give me a kiss, you make me close my eyes How will I know how good you are at kissing? If you want a good kiss, you got to close your eyes Hey! You've woken up! You speak as if this is the first time I've ever woken up Because that truck keeps honking away, I got to wake up early every morning why don't you keep that alarm clock close to your own ears? You ought to thank that clock which at least wakes you up on time Else, the whole world wants to fulfill its dreams in the world of dreams itself Hey Maninder... - Yes sir? Is everything okay? - We've got to replace the carburetor Take the carburetor from the new car and fit it in this one... and fit the old carburetor in the new car. - Could you please explain in detail? Sure, I will. If you put the carburetor of that car in this one... this one will work fine. And the car that's here for wheel-alignment... will soon be back for a replacement of the carburetor. You get that? Sure, I do. - You've understood... but make sure you don't tell Arav about it That's wonderful, Mr Vasvani. What a con job! We're here to fix cars and make money So get on with your work. Don't waste my time. Go on Go! Time is money Hey Ali-bhai... welcome to my garage! Skip the crap! What silly jobs you do! The cars get screwed in just two days Not again? Here's what I'll do I'll entrust your car to the real expert this time He has only to touch it and it'll be fine. Okay? Arav... Have you fixed the car? - This one can't be repaired It has a manufacturing defect. Sue the manufacturers... you'll get a new car. - But how do I know that you're right? What if I get stuck in a legal battle? I've never made a false claim where cars are concerned Okay? So don't you worry I have faith in my abilities Just wait and watch. There will come a day... when cars designed by me will zoom across every street of the world That's tops, I say! God bless you! "Sat Sri Akal, Papa-ji..." You've wasted so many pages to write just a single line? Wasted pages? I'm writing a letter to my folks, not wasting pages And, by the way, how do you write a letter in just a single line? I'll show you. - Go ahead. Let's see Here's the pen. I wanna see "I am fine here..." "and hope the same for you. Your son, Arav" Is that a letter or a telegram? You won't understand. Just mail it to my address You and I just don't think alike. - Right! You've come to America so that you can earn money... go back to India and settle down. - Oh sure, that's spot on But that's not what I want to do. Why should I leave the country... that's giving me everything? Name, fame, progress... why? Don't leave it, sir! Who's asking you to leave it? But do tell me something. What happens of your folks back home? They'll be fine. My elder brother is around to take care of them And once I get settled here, they can come here and live with me Sir, my designs are truly innovative and distinctively a class apart I seek your support to gain access to the research and development... department of your principals. - Mr Kapoor, you will have to find... alternative modes to access the authorities I suggest you send in your proposal directly Thank you Fab job Arav! You have turned my car into a new one. What did you do? Nothing much, just a few changes here and there You're so talented, why don't you start a workshop of your own? If you say, I'm willing to invest. - Mr. Patel... you want to throw me out of business? - Mr Patel... my aim is not the opening of a workshop. Basically I'm a car-designer... waiting for the right opportunity. - And this is the land of opportunity! You don't know Mr Patel, Arav He's opening a new discotheque very soon... to coincide with his nephew's marriage. - I hope you guys will attend By the way, Arav, give me a demo CD of your designs I know a lot of people in the car industry All right, sir. - I have a piece of advise You ought to visit the gypsy temple once and try your luck Look at them rocking! Shake a leg! It takes little to make a Sardar break into ajig! You get on with your luck! I'm going to have a blast! You can keep this. I'll take out another one Excuse me. It's not just another piece of paper we both made a wish and picked it up who knows? Maybe God wants both of us to know the same thing "You'll meet with your destiny today" I can't believe this! Are we each other's destiny? I don't believe in things like destiny we reached the temple at the same time, make a wish and pick up a chit... if all this can happen, why can't we be each other's destiny? Because this is just a coincidence and nothing more It's all about perception. What if we meet again? We'll see Hi, I'm Anna. - I'm Arav. Take care. Bye Anna! He's so handsome! Straight out of a romantic novel! "Girl you got me shocked from the rhythm of your body" "Burn coz its hot like wassabe" "Go low till you knock knees, shaking that ass..." "till we crash kamikaze" "Take my hand, make me turn around..." "put that flower-band in my hair-bun" "Sway with me, lover-boy..." "you have married me, now put up with my airs" "Love is real, love takes time" "Love is sinful and divine" "Look up at me, my love. Raise your eyes" "I'm a rare beauty, my love" "Take me in your arms, hold me to your bosom..." "don't make me pine like this" "On my moon-like face, apply a dot..." "embellish my beauty with pearls and diamonds" "Drape me in a sari that glitters" "You have married me... now put up with my airs" "watch me, undercover cops can't stop me" "Gonna lock you down with my lock and key" "Cause you could be Punjabi, Gujarati, Parsi or a banging Bengali" "Youth is but shortlived, my love" "I just can't wait anymore" "My heart is pounding, I'm beyond reasoning..." "fall in love with me" "Lay a bed in the room, give me all the joy in the world" "Let your lips feed mine the wine of love..." "you have married me, now put up with my tantrums" "Your tight-fitting blouse" "Your flowing scarf" "Your skirt pulled up" "They drive me crazy" "They're others who dance to your tunes, O pretty one" "They're others who do up your hair-bun" "I'm one of those who don't play up to women's tantrums" "I'm the love that makes makes women bow at my feet" "win me over with your charms..." "come rushing to me, whenever I call" "Give unto me your youthful charms" "Because I have married you... don't show me those airs" "Take my hand, make me turn around..." "put that flower-band in my hair-bun" "Sway with me, lover-boy..." "you have married me, now put up with my airs" "Love is the King. You're the Queen of the party" "Feeding to have a scene with this young hottie" "Have a ball, take a drag..." "talk about the sex and forget about the wedding" Arav, you look dashing in this black suit Thanks I'm waiting for a compliment too Oh! So you are a shy guy by nature Anyway, this is our second meeting. Do you think it's destiny? Mere happenstance There are just a handful of Indians in this city... who keep bumping into each other on festive occasions It'll be a mistake to call it destiny. There are hundreds of thousands of people in this city So, our meeting again has definitely got something to do with destiny Suit yourself with whatever beliefs. - His belief, not mine You'll surely accept it some day. - Well, it's that... wow! Friends already? Nothing of the sort. Just a coincidence that we've met again My word! You need good-fortune for such coincidences, my friend! Bye! Dammit! What wrong have I done? - I was trying hard to shake her off... and like an idiot, you took up for her! What a nut! You don't try to shake off gals like her! You ought to be chasing her! Anna, he should be crazy about you, but he's just not encouraging you! Nams, some guys like it slow. - Yeah Even I like it. This is the way... slow! But not so slow as to get old and proclaim one day... "Darling, I love you" Nams, he might not agree with me today... but one day he'll surely realise that I'm his destiny That trip to the temple and our second meeting... things like these don't happen every other day I'm just waiting for our next meeting There must surely be something that will bring us close to each other Excuse me. Can I test-drive this car? - Sorry, sir. It's only for display Can I check the interiors? - With pleasure. All yours You...? Here? - I am, wherever you are I'm sure you think this is a coincidence too Actually I am very fond of cars well, cars are my life, my passion... my destiny Destiny? Cars? So we do have something in common It was nice talking to you. See you again... if there is a coincidence Believe me, my destiny will surely bring us together again. By a coincidence This car was launched only today and you've bought it already? I haven't bought it, I'm just taking a test-drive when I asked for it, I was turned down. How come you got it? I'm well connected, you see? You want a lift? What are you so thoughtful about? C'mon! You are such a weirdo. Guys pray to get a lift from a beautiful girl... and you are acting pricey. - Okay Do me a favour, please. - What? Give me my bag lying back there Here you are. - Open it Excuse me, it's very unsafe to open a lady's purse You won't be embarrassed. Open it Done. - So give it to me Give you what? - Give me the scarf in the bag! I can't see anything. Hurry up. - Here you are what on earth are you doing...? We'll end up having a collision while you're tying up your hair! God! Here's a harassed girl... instead of helping her, you're yelling at her? Can't you simply tie up my hair. Go on now. Do it Are you serious? - Tie it up, I can't see a thing! What are you doing? Tie it up! - As if I've done a course in this! Sit still, will you? Tie it up properly Thank you. - You're welcome This is fun! Amazing body! - It takes years for a body like this I can see that. But I've never seen a shape like this one And this colour... it's a killer! I wish I could have it right now. - What? This car. I love its aerodynamics Arav, what's your profession? - I am a car designer If I get the opportunity, I could design a better car than this one Anyway, you can drop me here when are we going to meet again? - Whenever your destiny wants us to Take care. Bye My laptop! Hey Arav! Congratulations! There's an urgent interview call for you from BMw All the best, my friend. - Congratulations! I won't be able to appear for this interview why not? - What's the matter? I forgot my laptop in Anna's car. - So call Anna and have it brought here I don't have her number. - But you have her address? Let's go and fetch it. - I don't have her address either She was giving it to me, but... - You mean, you didn't take it? God Almighty! When's this guy going to have some common sense? Guess what? You gave a demo CD to Patel, right? So I'll call Patel and have that CD rushed back. Simple I hope I don't mess up this opportunity Patel's cellphone is switched off. But don't worry, Arav CD or no CD, you must go for the interview Mr Arav Kapoor, we at BMw believe that new talent has to be promoted... and in keeping with this tradition we have invited you here today I'm very grateful, sir, but the thing is... I have a problem I lost my laptop yesterday, so I won't be able to show you the designs... and the demos I have made. - But we have already have your demo CD we have gone through your designs and the opinion of my panel is that... it's very impressive. So we have decided to give you a go-ahead welcome to BMw. - Thank you so much The administrative officer will introduce you to your work-station... as well as your personal assistant Hi Arav. - What are you doing here? Call it a coincidence By a quirk of destiny, I happen to be your assistant Oh, now I see. You showed them my laptop A coincidence. You forgot your laptop in my car... and when I looked into it for your address, I discovered a genius The rest, you know I don't know how to thank you Anna You've made my dream come true You deserve it. So now do you believe in destiny? Maybe not in destiny, but yes... I have started believing in you "He loves me...?" "He loves me not" "He loves me!" "When you lose your heart to someone..." "you're on the horns of a dilemma" "O my love... I hope I don't fall in love" "when you lose your heart to someone..." "you're on the horns of a dilemma" "O my love... I hope I don't fall in love" "I hope I'm not bowled over by her charms" "I hope I don't find myself lost in her eyes" "I hope I do not err..." "my heart knows not what anguish love causes" "when you lose your heart to someone..." "it's oh so difficult" "O my love... I hope I don't fall in love" "what intoxication leads me astray...?" "What fragrance my lovely memories exude?" "Never was I in such a state..." "what desires now consume my heart?" "When you lose your heart to someone..." "it's oh so difficult" "O my love... I hope I don't fall in love" "when you lose your heart to someone..." "you're on the horns of a dilemma" "It's difficult... oh so difficult" "It's difficult... oh so difficult" Nams! I'm in love! I'm in love! Madam, you've taken Arav for your life-partner But isn't it necessary to find out whether he's your type at all? Yes, you are right! But how do we find out? Simple, let's ask him Stupid, as if I'd ask and he'd tell me. It's not so easy You're right. What should we do then? Got it! Anna! What happened? Did you find out...? So tell me! Please Anna! Tell me! - Okay The company's procedures. All employees have to go through a psychoanalysis test what's that? Psychoanalysis. - What on earth is that? The company wants to know what kind of a person you are... your likes and dislikes and so on Everybody's got to do it. Take a look at this Okay. Shoot The question? Sure. What are you fond of? - I'm fond of food I don't know how to cook. - Stupid! What are cookery books for? I love Chinese, Lebanese, Mexican, Italian, Thai... but nothing to beat our spicy Indian food Butter chicken, cottage-cheese cooked in butter and lentil-curry! They say, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach Isn't that a rather odd route? - But guys love all the odd routes! Should I let you into something personal? Promise me you won't laugh. - I won't Sure? Promise? - Yes I love watching cartoons. - Cartoons! At your age! Sorry Give me a big box of buttered popcorns and my favorite cartoons Tom and Jerry, Scooby Doo, Batman, Spiderman, Tin Tin, Richie Rich... and so on So cute! What is your sexuality? - What?! I mean, are you bi, hetro, metro, tetro...? What...? Well, I'm happy and gay. - What?! Why do all the guys with such good qualities turn out to be gay? I was only kidding Thank God! What would you gift your girlfriend on a date? How does that concern the company? That's my personal life! That's precisely why I'm asking you. To know more about you I'm asking you stuff from the questionnaire. Take a look, if you wish Let me see Okay, go ahead what gift would you give her? A bouquet of flowers... or an expensive platinum necklace studded with diamonds... or something that your girlfriend is really fond of? I won't gift her any of these. I'll gift my girlfriend a cactus plant Cactus! Flowers can wilt. Expensive gifts can be stolen But not the cactus. We use the cactus for the security of our homes... and a cactus will always remind my girlfriend... that if anyone ever tries to act smart with her... I'm going to smash his... Fantastic! Unimaginably romantic! He's just my type. Arav was made only for me Coffee? Know something? That's just what I was thinking about And you said it. - So I can read your mind I'll go and get it. - Okay Young man, it's Friday night when all your friends are enjoying the week-end with their families... why're you still working? - Sir, this is not just work for me It's my very life. If you don't mind, may I ask you something? Yes? - Why are you working so late? It's like this, son. I happen to be the Chairman of this company This huge empire you now see was once a dream I so cherished Like you, I too want to reach these heights of success, sir Very ambitious boy. What's your name? - Arav Kapoor. Nice meeting you. I can see that our association will go a long way. God bless you Congratulations, Arav! - Thank you! It's because of you that I was able to taste success today You were the first one to spot my talent. Arav, some people make such a name for themselves... that the world remembers them forever I'm sure you are one of them. - You have so much of faith in me? Yes, I do. And you owe me a treat. - I'll fulfill all your wishes today First things first. Let's go and party Okay C'mon guys! Cheers! Arav, this is Virvani here. - Yes, sir? I have gone through the reports. Well done, my boy Thank you, sir! We have finalized October 11 as the date for the launch of your car Cheers! - Thank you, sir Is everything all right? I'm so happy... I'll go mad! What happened?

I realise today how beautiful you are I'm glad you've realised it at last I've also come to realise... that I'm in love with you. I love you, Anna I love you too The function has started. Why isn't Anna here yet? A girl needs time to get ready. So be patient Hey Arav, congratulations! Isn't this the moment you've always waited for? Arav, Mr Virvani wants to see you in his chambers May I come in, sir? Arav, this is the most expensive city in the world... and this is the most expensive piece of land in the city... where our office is situated This company thrives on hardwork and intelligence... but life feeds on love and emotions I lost my son and daughter-in-law in a car accident Everything was finished for me.

Anna, I have to leave for India immediately But what for? - My dad is not well Is he okay? - I've no idea Quickly pack your stuff, I'll drop you at the airport I'm already there. My flight leaves in 30 minutes Okay! Call me once you reach there. Okay, baby I'll miss you. - I'll miss you too. Take care Come back soon. - Bye "Do come now, my sweetheart..." "come and see what state I've been in" "Come, give me a hug..." "I'm yearning to see you" "I can't tell you how much I've loved you" "You are the one I have awaited every moment" "Awake or asleep..." "yours were the memories I was always immersed in" "Parted from you, my love..." "I've been through hell" "Do come now, my sweetheart..." "come and see what state I've been in" "Ever since I've received word from you, sweetheart..." "I've been on a strange high" "I can't spend my time, however hard I try..." "your face just doesn't melt of my sight" "This good news, my love..." "has awakened a pining" "Do come now, my sweetheart..." "come and see what state I've been in" "Come, give me a hug..." "I'm yearning to see you" "we are going so fast. Aren't you scared?" "When you are with me, I'm not scared at all" "In fact, this is great fun!" Tell me something, Arav. Do you like Kajal? I do, grandma. - And Kajal? Do you like Arav? He's the only one I like, grandma why don't we ask Arav's parents to let him stay with us? And if I send you away to Arav's place? - That's fine with me! Oh no. If I'll go away, who will take care of you? Well, well. I never thought of that Greetings. - Greetings Now tell me something. What do you think of my Kajal? Not just me, our whole family likes her a lot. Come here, my child Thank God. Everybody loves my Kajal But why are you asking all this? I need to ask the opinion of her prospective in-laws, right? They are still very young. Let them grow up. There's a lot of time They have time, but I don't I am the only one she has. If something happens to me... Don't worry aunty. I give you my word... Kajal will surely become the daughter-in-law of our family Oh yes! Kajal, kiss this stone, will you? You've got a great aim No, it's your kiss that does the trick Guess why we love each other so much? - Why? Because we eat from the same plate. It's supposed to make our love stronger And when it makes love stronger, you get married I see. No wonder grandma was talking about our marriage But I am going away to boarding school. - So what? You'll be back during the vacations, won't you? No, I'll study for the next year during the vacations So you're going to forget me? I'm only going to study, not to forget you we're wasting our time. These trees will die Saplings planted in the rains don't ever die Even if you forget me, these trees will remind you of me Bless you, son Grandma! Go on, son. Put all your heart into your studies You won't forget me once you've become a successful engineer, will you? No, grandma. I'll never forget you Bye, Kajal. - Sweets for you He's not going away forever, my dear. It's just a matter of a few days No grandma, it's a matter of years Don't worry, these years will pass very soon Congratulations, Arav. You've topped the exams in the whole college You'll easily get ajob in any automobile company But I want to go to America for further studies and design top line cars there My visa and tickets have arrived. I'm leaving in 48 hours You mean, you are directly going to the airport from here? No, I'll go home first. So much must've changed in ten years I got to know of it only through letters earlier. I'll get to see it now Now look, Arav, I have no objection to your going away to America But before you go, you'll have to marry Kajal Marry! There's no way I am getting married But why not? Papa, I've got to complete my M. Tech and settle down That could take 6 months or even 6 years! Yes dad, Arav is right If he's sixty by the time he settles down... are we going to get him married as an old fossil? Marriage isn't just a formality, it comes with a lot of responsibilities I've yet to stand on my own two feet, and you want me to carry another burden? Daughters and daughters-in-law are not a burden on the family Mom! How am I going to make you see reason? I'm not mentally prepared yet to marry Kajal Great! I never knew you had to be mentally prepared to get married! Why don't you understand my problem, Dad? Please, Papa. Marriage is a bond... where two people come together to spend the rest of their lives with each other That's true, Papa. Kajal has been waiting for Arav for ten years It's better if we let her and Arav take a decision on their own You've changed so much, Arav Everything changes with time, Kajal Men change, so does their thought-process Now look at this sun. It rises in the morning and lights up the whole world... but set it does, every evening. That's what we think, Arav The Sun never sets, it just hides itself from us And we fool ourselves that it has set Kajal, I really thought that even if my parents don't understand me... you really will, because you've known me since our childhood That's precisely why I don't understand you Especially because I have known you since our childhood You are the only one I've ever truly known I still think of you as my same old Arav Kajal, I want to make a few things very clear to you It's true that we spent some great moments together... but now I neither have any memories nor any longing for them You might not, but I do Love only gets deeper with time why don't you understand? I don't want to be tied down in relationships Ten years is a long time, Arav But how they went by, one couldn't even realise But Grandma doesn't have much time See if you can convince her, I've got used to living with memories anyway My son, I'm counting my days I want to see Kajal married before I die Accept my daughter, Arav. Please marry Kajal Once she's married... I can tell her parents that I've come after fulfilling my duties "A traditional North Indian wedding" I want to see you as a successful man The day you reach the dizzy heights of success you want to scale... we can have our nuptials I'll wait for that moment, Arav what a co-incidence Arav It was raining the day you left... and today when you have returned, it's raining again I've no interest in this rain today I've come only to meet you Only to meet me...? By saying that, you've given me the best gift of my life Today even if you ask me for my life, I'd give it to you with a smile I don't need your life, Kajal Then what is it that you want Arav? What? Divorce? I still can't believe that Arav could do a thing like this I thought he had come back to either stay or to take you along I too believed that my Arav had come back to me Not even in my dreams could I imagine that he would come here for a divorce No, Kajal. Nobody's going to let him break our house like this Dad, Mom, my husband... nobody's going to support him wait till I go and tell everyone Pressurising him might get me the status of his wife... but I won't ever get his love So what are we going to do? Arav lives in every memory I have of my childhood If distance has made Arav forget his love... then I only have to remind him of it I'll remind him of our love I'll remind him of our past. I'll win him over again I am with you Promise me that this will remain a secret between you and me Damn! No network signals! Good morning, Arav. - Good morning, sis-in-law So what's cooking? - Your favourite. Porridge Kajal told me how much you love it. - My favourite? What's my favourite? Funny! You don't even remember your favourite dish? I hope your stay in America hasn't changed your preferences Oh no That's okay. Ask Kajal. She might remind you Should I? - No, I remember now I want some tea. Bring it to my room I'm giving sis-in-law a hand Just go to your room, I'll send it with Kaka, okay? I couldn't find today's newspaper. Could you bring it for me? Brother's reading the newspaper. Why don't you read it with him? I'm going to take a shower. Get me a towel Listen... the towel's already in the bathroom Anything else? - Nothing Listen... - Now what? Dad has something important to discuss with you. Have a word with him, will you? I'll bring your tea there. Okay? Come, son. Sit down Arav, why don't you work here in India, instead of America? Daddy, I won't get that kind of response in India... why? Don't they make cars in India? There are several big companies here, Arav Brother, the cars I have designed are all meant for the international market Those cars are not meant for Indian roads And now when I am getting recognition in America... it's not wise to make a shift. - Okay! But make sure you take Kajal along this time That reminds me, I have to book my ticket... and I can't find my passport anywhere. - Kajal, have you seen his passport? No, he must've kept it somewhere I had kept it in my suitcase. And now it's not there Help him find it. Will you, dear? - Sure, Dad You said it's not in the suitcase. So what is this?
