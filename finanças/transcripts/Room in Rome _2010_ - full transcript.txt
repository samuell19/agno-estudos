It's better if you're asleep. That way we don't have to say goodbye. You're right. I?ll say a few words. Goodbye, Alba. I don't want to imagine what might have happened. This secret will stay there, sleeping with you. Thank you, Alba. Goodbye. Who changed my ring tone? What the hell happened? Natasha, right. Good evening. Good evening. Poor thing. Where did you come from? How could you just show up like this, without warning? I can't believe I'm doing this. What are you doing to me? You're scaring me, little Russian. ls this me? I can't recognize myself. Russian sounds so beautiful. Only for you. I?m trembling with fear too. Good evening. Yes, it is. Hungry yet? The lady needs a vibrator. I?m sorry, we don't have any. But I can bring something else. We have fruit. That's not good enough. Something else might work... No, forget it. Thanks, Max. We're fine, Max. We don't need anything. I brought a hot cucumber. What? I boiled it for two minutes. It's sterile. My friend would rather use the wine bottle. It's Tuscan. What about you? Me? I?m a virgin. Congratulations. Spain beat Italy. Fair and square. What's that? The Eurocup. Soccer. Soccer bores me. What about your friend? Her as well. She's a Russian tennis player. What? I love Russian tennis players. Though I?m starting to wonder. Check her arm? What? One arm should be stronger than the other. You two wanna have a trio? Uh-oh. Wanna see it first? No, Max. It's nice of you to offer, but no. It's a beautiful language. Please, go. Leave us alone. I got my hopes up. I thought it's what you wanted. I?m sorry, it was a misunderstanding. We shouldn't have called you. Good night. I was only joking about the cucumber. Please, hold still. Alba, you said it wrong. Then teach me how to say it! We'll hold still when you say it right. Mommy. Give me a kiss. What? I?m sorry, Vadim, but I can never tell you about this. Now I have a secret too. But it's much further away than yours. Maybe I missed the sign in the painting. It's you, my little Russian. The good thing I was expecting. You'll always have that... my reflection. This... is mine alone. Can I help you? Yes. We want to be the first to have breakfast. Glad to hear it. What would you like? Something light, heavy? As heavy as it gets. You want it to last? Yes, please. A nice big breakfast then. Thanks, Max. Don't worry. I hardly slept because of you. And I don't like flying when I?m tired. Who is that? Room service. She brought breakfast. You're having breakfast? Yes. I?m hungry. I?ll see you at the hotel after. Hi. Good morning. lt certainly is. We're outside, on the terrace. Today's the first day of summer. There you go. This time it was easy. You wanted two large breakfasts and here they are. Thank you, Max. What's that? You gave me a shock! You're the one who shocked me! What, my love? Electricity. Yes. Yes. - Yes? - Yes. What? What is it? Dasha, what's going on? Nothing, I?ll get dressed and come right over. You're not dressed? - No, I?m wearing white. You're ahead of the wedding. Yeah, way ahead. I don't understand you, Dasha. Good.
