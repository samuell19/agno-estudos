(SCREAMING) (CAR CRASHING) What? It just cut off. Did you do that? What happened? It's like super feedback. Just put the underwoofer across the overflapper. I don't know. Just went dead air. MAN 1: I want the license plate. MAN 2: No problem. All right, now, ease up here. MAN 2: You go get your pictures. Watch out, Bob. MAN 2: All right, keep the tension on that line. MAN 3: Hey, loosen that chain. We need some slack. MAN 2: Easy. Easy. (SIREN BLARING) You, get out of there! WOMAN ON RADIO: Three-zero. Cowboy, get away from there. This is an accident scene. The area is restricted. - Not gonna tell you... - It's all right. It's all right, Wendell. Lieutenant Enright, sir. We heard you might be headed this way. Did you come over for the big game? You know why I'm here. Yes, sir, something about the chainsaw killers, your brother's kids killed. But that was 14 years ago, sir, way down in South Texas. Now, these are other kids. This is just an accident. Just a couple of wild punks out raising hell. Yep. One of those boys is so wild sawed his own head off going 90 mile per hour. (CHUCKLES) Hell. Hell's exactly what they raised. No, sir, that information's off the record. You know, sir, this is always a pretty hairy weekend for Dallas. Whole lot of folks come to town and don't give a damn about football. You know, they just wanna go blood crazy for a few and riot. You know what "riot" means. You were a Ranger. I can't hardly keep them down by law, and if... If you go around promoting this chainsaw... Try to speak plain. Saves time. (GRUNTS) I have authority from the DA's office to put you right back on the next plane to Amarillo. Well, you just do that, son. I'd like to see that authority. All right, Lieutenant Enright, what's your deal? All right. I'm gonna ask some questions. Put it in the press. Get it in the news. Any information about this accident and maybe some witnesses. Yes, sir, I know some old boys at the paper. We'll get your story out for you. Brazos. Brazos. Brazos! Remember the Alamo, cowboy. (ALL LAUGHING) (ROCKMUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) MAN 1: I won! (MAN WHISTLING) MAN 2: Come on! Asshole. (WHOOPS) You need a witness? I'm a witness. This Mercedes? I think I was talking to those kids when it happened. No way was that an accident. - You saw it. - No, but I heard it. You can listen. It's here on tape. (LAUGHING) Regulations. We gotta record all the call-ins. End of the night, we wipe the tapes, but I kept this one just 'cause... It just got to me. We got professionals working on this... I didn't know what I'd heard, but I read your story. - What you're looking for is on this tape. - ...so don't fool with it. You can slow it down now. STRETCH: Um... You're just a joke in this morning's paper. "Cowboy chases Chainsaws 14 years." "Dallas police refuse comment." Like you're, you know, hung up on something crazy. But I believe you. I might be the only believer you got. - Cause it's right here. - What is? Right on here, those kids getting killed. Now, this is evidence, sort of, right? Yeah, it's time for you to go home. - No, wait a minute, wait a minute. - Come on. Look, I came here because I thought I could help you. I deejay this dumb show on K-OKLA up in Burkburnett, but people listen to me all across North Texas. Now, I could put you on the radio, get people to believe you, get you some help. You're gonna get in my way. - Don't you get in my way. - No, I'm already right in the middle of this. This is my chance to stop playing head-banging music and do something real. Well, I don't need anybody to stand with me, all right? You can't do it alone. (ENRIGHT CHUCKLES) I got a perfect willingness to die. That gives me a moral on this bunch of mad dogs. They live on fear. They thrive on it. I ain't got no fear left. (SPEAKS SPANISH) I ain't got no fear, Lord. (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY) - Hardass. - Hardass? Me? Well, maybe a semi-hardass, but I got a soft heart. Looky. - Built you a little fry house. - L.G.! What, darling? Oh, L.G. (TRIANGLE RINGING) Okay, everybody, hush up. Listen up, y'all. The Texas-OU Chili Cook-off champion is from Norman, Oklahoma? No. (PEOPLE CHEERING) Waco, Texas? Mmm-mmm. Tulsa? Nope. - Pardon me. - Austin? Uh-uh. He's Dallas' favorite caterer. I think he's kind of cute. The Last Round-up Rolling Grill Chef, Drayton Sawyer! (ALL CHEERING) (PEOPLE WHISTLING) Drayton! ALL: Drayton! Drayton! Drayton! Drayton! WOMAN: Way to go, Drayton! It's the second year in a row. This year, Drayton, you've got to tell the secret of that fabulously tasty chili! No secret. It's the meat. Don't skimp on the meat. I got a real good eye for prime meat. Runs in the family. (CHUCKLING) (EXCLAIMS) It's one of those hard-shell peppercorns. (PEOPLE LAUGHING) I gotta say, I love this town. This town loves prime meat! (PEOPLE CHEERING) (ALL APPLAUDING) So there's the big story. Texas clobbers Oklahoma in chili. This is Stretch, your fearless reporter, live from Dallas. (MARCHING BAND PLAYING) (MAN SPEAKING ON RADIO) STRETCH: Now, be sure to watch your drinking and driving on this wild and woolly Texas-OU Weekend. This is Stretch, on K-OKLA... (PHONE RINGING) Cut-Rite. No, C.L., I ain't seen Fletcher. Well, last Friday. Well, hell, he's on the road, then. Well, don't believe me, then. Fine. C.L. No. I'll be with you in just a minute, sir. Now, you're getting as mean as a sting bat, C.L. CLERK: No, hell, don't call back. No, don't you call back. I got a business here, and Fletcher ain't none of my business. Damn! (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) What can I do you for? Well, don't you wanna test them? There's gas in them. Get them suckers a time or two. (MOTOR WHIRRING) Oh, my kid banana. Damn, what is he doing? (CLERK LAUGHING) Now, this is very hard to believe. I'd like you to play that tape, missy. Come all the way up here to Burkburnett. No shit! Yeah. Oh, you wanna hear it now. I wanna hear it on the radio. On your show. Uh-uh. I don't think it'd be legal to do that. FCC regulations, those things. Well, you just figure out how to do it and do it. You bend the rules. I don't know. (CHUCKLES) - Why? - Because the killers are here. Kill sites have been clustered all over Northeast Texas the last two years. The laws, they shy away from piecing it together as murder. They call it accidents, disappearances. You got that last slaughter on tape. You play it on the radio. Maybe then, the laws will stop trying to shut me up and start helping me. Besides, it'll give you something real to do. You said you were gonna do this alone. (SIGHS) I need your help, missy. Well, you can call me Stretch, Mr. Enright. Well, now, you can call me Lefty. It's mighty nice doing business with you. - Thanks. - All right. You have a nice day, now. You, too. (COOK LAUGHING) Number one again! Drayton did it again. Number one. Number one! The Sawyers are number one! (LAUGHING) Number one. (RADIO SHOW THEME PLAYING) So here's a special request we're doing this afternoon and tonight. You steady listeners know we're playing this every hour. This is for Lefty. BUZZ.: Hog fucker! Son of a bitch! (CHAINSAWBUZZING) (PHONE RINGING) (LAUGHING) Last Round-up Rolling Grill. We're still number one. I told you, boys, and Hold you. Don't call on this phone. Now, damn it, get off. What? What's on the radio? Now, don't bullshit me. I can't... I won't... All right, what station? This ain't no joke, boy? Then I'm tuning it in. BUZZ: Hog fucker! Son of a bitch! (CHAINSAWBUZING) You two nap-haired idiots. You've done it again! You coon shits! You fudge-packers! You'll be the death of me yet! (LAUGHING) (CHAINSAW WHIRRING) RICK: Missed us, assholes. (PHONE RINGING) (RICK SCREAMING) K-OKLA. Come on, Lefty. Where are you? (CAR CRASHING) This concludes the broadcast day for K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas, Red River Rock 'n' Roll. In New York, it's 1:00 a.m., still fun city. In LA, 10:00 at night, party time. But deep in the heart of Texas, it's 12:00 midnight. Ain't nothing going on. (STAR-SPANGLED BANNER PLAYING) It's another cussing caller. Your little ass is gonna be in big trouble over that tape, girl. Nope. (SIGHS) Sure got a lot of complaints, darling. (SIGHS) L.G., it was a request, right? It's listed in the logs as a request. People complain about the request every night, right? Uh-huh. Wanna go for coffee at Big State? Nope. Huh, I guess you're waiting on this guy, Lefty? L.G. (SIGHS) Night, L.G. Good night. God damn it!

But, yeah, but... (EXCLAIMS) So this is radio land, huh? The infinite turnover? The waves through the ether fuzz roll on forever. (MIMICKING ROAR) Can't close that. Hi, I know what you're thinking. "This is weird. Hope I can handle it." (LAUGHS) You know, you're my fave. Me and Bubba, my little brother, we listen to you every night. Music is my life. You know, you're my fave, but I get too embarrassed to phone in my request. It's too disembodied, you know? But (FLESH SIZZLING) ...now that we're here in flesh and blood, I could maybe make a request, and it'd still count, huh? Uh-huh. Sure. Mmm-hmm. Well, what about Iron Butterfly? (LAUGHING) You know, like "In-A-Vida-Da-Gadda, Baby?" Oh, it's heavy! You know, I've never been to a radio station before. Do you think you could do me a tour, huh? Tour? Tour. Sure. Mmm-hmm, sure. But seriously quick, and it ends at the exit sign. Oh, boy! Okay, yeah, sure! Okay, your tour. Here's your tour. Here's your tour. Here's a lamp. Yeah, lamp. Here's a typewriter.

(MIMICKING BUZZER) (MIMICKING GUN FIRING) (SCREAMING) (CHUCKLING) What was it, anyway? The " Rambo III" soundtrack? (GRUNTS) Gonna play it again? (COAT HANGER SCREECHING) Sure would like it. Hey, maybe I could get a copy, and you could autograph it. To a far-out fan! (CHUCKLES) - What's in here? - Record vault. Oh, where you keep the golden oldies? And maybe... Maybe the new music's in... (STRETCH SCREAMING) Not me, you dumb-ass! Get the girl! Get the girl! (SCREAMING) (LEATHERFACE GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (EXCLAIMING) He dented my plate! My brain is burning!

Wanna go to the movies? No crowds. Everybody's at the football parties. COOK: Tonight's a washout. Biggest meat-eater weekend of the month, and we're gonna lose money on it. Damn it all! Maybe we just ought to quit. CHOP-TOP: Oh, yeah? Kiss my plate, Mr. Big Shot. Maybe you forgot. This chromedome bankrolled this food business. No lucky goof with a machete, no head wound. No head wound, no fancy rolling grill a-go-go. Ain't no fool. Kiss it. Don't forget it. (WHIRRING) Peel that pig and slice him thick. - That's my sweet pea. - Get them hogs on the grill.

Of course this is what happens. That big brute! Dirty meat don't cut it. Family standards only require the best meat in town. More money lost. I never, never, never get a break. Work, work night and day, presenting myself to the people, selling, selling. You pair of prima donnas fooling around here and listening to the radio all day and sawing down your own house.

Go look at it. Taxes. Taxes. Damn property taxes fuck up everything. COOK: Crooks don't pay taxes. Politicians don't. Movie stars don't. It's the little guy that can't make a dime. He pays the taxes. Small businessman gets it in the ass every time. COOK: I ought to quit. CHOP-TOP: Right, it's junk. Quit. Dump this cook show. Sell off this turkey. It's time. It's in the air.

Go up there and look at it. Go look at it. - I'll kick you in the ass again. - Not now. It's Nam Land. - It's a hit. It's a bang. It's a smash. - Shut him up, Bubba. Did you see it? Well, did you? Didn't you? Did you? Didn't you? Go check it out, boy. - Nam Land! - Oh, shut up! (SNICKERING) I told you to go check it out, boy, before I start kicking your ass. Some kind of crazy booger just skipped through here. No, a booger? How big? A big crazy booger. Let's haul butt, bro. (BUZZING) Oh, my God. Oh, God. Franklin. Don't you cry, my brother. I'm here now.

Leatherface killed her once already tonight. But look, she's red-faced. Bubba's been playing with her. Bubba likes her. Bubba's got a girlfriend. (SINGSONGING) Bubba's got a girlfriend! Bubba's got a girlfriend! Bubba's got a girlfriend! Bubba's got a girlfriend! Bubba's got a girl... (LAUGHING) COOK: Is that what this is, Bubba? The old cock-and-cunt swindle, huh? S-C-E-X. Sex. And you had to find out about it, didn't you? COOK: You just couldn't leave it alone. If you wanted to know about it so bad, why didn't you ask me? You wanna know about it? You wanna know about it? Ask me. Ask me. It's a swindle, that's all. So don't get mixed up in it. Help me. Help me. Help me. Please, help me. Please. Help me. Please, help me. All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.

Turn traitor for a piece of tail. You got one choice, boy, sex or the saw. Sex is, well, nobody knows. But the saw, the saw is family. - The saw is family. - Wait till Granddad hears about this. Take her away. - She's in the garbage now. - Oh, no. - Oh, no. - A-one and a-two and three! No! (SCREAMING) Dinnertime, damn it! Let's go. Eat and run. Eat and run. There's a lot of hungry football fans to feed. Hurry it up. Grandpa likes to go fast. He always did. Come on. Come on. Time eats money. (LAUGHING) Those damn coon shits are the weight of the family. I stoop my shoulders taking care of my younger brothers. It squashed the young years out of my life like a can of cheese whip. (BELL RINGING) I wouldn't wish this rotten life off on a one-eyed ferret with mange. You're the first girl Bubba's brought home to dinner. This is a real special occasion. Grandpa sure looks forward to meeting you. He's 137 years old but still as fast as Jesse James, so don't you worry none. Here comes Grandpa now. (STRETCH SCREAMING) God bless you, Grandpa. (SINGSONGING) Oh, it's playtime! It's dinnertime! Your little boys have some left here for you. Yes, no, yes, no! Yes, we do! We love you! We love you! (STRETCH SCREAMING) CHOP-TOP: Okay, now. Take it easy, now. Take it easy with Grandpa. - That's right. That's right. - COOK: Get him over here easy, now. CHOP-TOP: That's right. Okay. GRANDPA: Come on, you boys. CHOP-TOP: Easy with Grandpa, now. - CHOP-TOP: Oh, easy with Grandpa. - No! No! STRETCH: Oh, please, no. Don't rattle him like that, damn it! You're balling up his shit. No! Grandpa's strict liquid diet keeps him as fresh as a rose. Every spring, the Atlas Rendering Company used to throw a big barbecue for Grandpa. Oh, he was the master. He was the one and only. He showed us all the business. (STRETCH SCREAMING) We was raised in meat. (LAUGHING) But then after the glory, here comes the shame. Atlas went for automation. The electrified cages, the cold-steel chutes, the air-powered head hammers. That drove Grandpa crazy, seeing things done like that. Let me go! Let me go! No, no, that's all right. That's all right. It'll be over soon. (MOANING) Get the hammer. Get the hammer. The crunching and the grinding, he just couldn't stand it, no way. COOK: So that was all she wrote. One morning, Grandpa just quit going in. It was the shame. (WHIMPERING) It was the shame. The shame. There's more work to do. Let's get on with it. Right. Let's get on with it. Bingo! Give me that. Get that tub over there in a hurry. Do I have to do every damn thing around here? You just sit tight. (SCREAMS) Bubba, she's ready. Bring her on down. No! (SQUEAKING) - Oh, no! - Bring her on down, damn it! STRETCH: No! No! Bring her on down! No! No, no, no! No, no, no! (SOBBING) STRETCH: Help me! No, no, no! Let me go! You gotta let me go! Let me go! Please, help me! - This will be one you won't forget. - Please, help me! It's a real honor. Grandpa, he's a one-hitter. And it's just like going home. (STRETCH SCREAMING) Please help me! - No! No! No, God! - No, no. Help me! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! (LAUGHING) Help me, please! Please, help me! Let's go see Grandpa, boy. No, don't! - No! No, God! - Come on. Bring the bitch down. No! No! No! No, no, let me go! Let me go! Let me go! No! No! No, no, no! (CHOP-TOP LAUGHING) No! Here come the judge. Here come the judge. No! Now, don't ruin Grandpa's favorite rug. Be careful of the splatter. You gotta be careful of the splatter. Oh, Great-grandma in chainsaw heaven... No! No! God! ...please don't hoodoo the boy. Hey, Grandpa, here's the big boy. Look what Bubba brought you. Hey, Grandpa, Bubba's got something to show you here. Look, a Slurpee booty. (LAUGHING) - CHOP-TOP: Hit her, Grandpa. - Come on, Grandpa. Let's see you do it. Now, come on. Come on, Grandpa. You're the best. - Hit her, Grandpa. Hit her! - Come on. Hit her, Grandpa. Come on, I'm telling you... Remember those thieves? Come on. One-hitter. - Come on, Grandpa. - Hit her. Hit her, Grandpa. Come on, you won't miss her. (SCREAMING) - Come on, Grandpa. - Come on, Grandpa. Hit her. Hit that bitch. Hit that bitch. Come on, Grandpa. Come on, Grandpa. You can do it. You're the best. Come on, there, Grandpa. Come on, there, Grandpa. Come on, Grandpa. You can do it. You're the best. (STRETCH SCREAMING) Hit her, Grandpa. Come on, Grandpa. You're the best, Grandpa. Hit that bitch, Grandpa. Hit her. Come on, Grandpa. Hit her. You are, Grandpa. You're the best. CHOP-TOP: Yeah! That's good, isn't it, Grandpa? Grandpa! COOK: Attaboy, Grandpa. CHOP-TOP: Hit that bitch, now, Grandpa. - Come on, Grandpa. You can do it. - Get her now, Grandpa. You can do it. Come on, Grandpa. (CRASHING) STRETCH: No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Hit that bitch. Hit that bitch! CHOP-TOP: Come on, Grandpa! (SCREAMS) Come on, Grandpa! Oh, Grandpa, let's get on with it. All right! SIurpee-booty time! (METALLIC CLANGING) (CHAINSAW WHIRRING) (ENRIGHT SINGING) (CHOP-TOP SINGING ALONG WITH ENRIGHT) Oh, shut up! What the hell's going on here? (ENRIGHT SINGING) (CEILING CREAKING) (SINGING) Boys, boys, boys. What the hell's going on here? Is that the American way of entering a man's home, singing like that? Oh, I get it. The old pressure game, huh? Boys, you never should have been doing this. Who sent you? Those Sissies over at Del-Mar Catering? COOK: That chickenshit burrito-man bunch? (COOK CHUCKLING) Well, I don't care, you hear? Yeah, that's right. It's a dog-eat-dog world. And from where I sit, there just ain't enough damn dogs. If you can't stand the heat, get out of the damn kitchen. (CHUCKLES) How much, huh? Let's make a deal right here. Real cash money. Just you and me, huh? I don't care who sent you. I'm the Lord of the Harvest. Who's that? Some new health-food bunch? Come on. Come on. Is there any money in it, you wanna know? Yeah, right here. How much, huh? How much? (CLATTERING) - Lefty. - Sister. Lefty! Brazos! (SCREAMING) Run, sister. Run! (ENRIGHT GRUNTING) (LEATHERFACE YELLING) (YELLING) (CHUCKLING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) (EXCLAIMING) Small businessman that always, always, always gets it in the ass! Sure... Sure took care of my hems. Saved a trip to the hospital. Looks... Looks bad. Sure burned my beads bad on that one. (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) (GRUNTS) (SCREAMING) Maybe it's time to just shut down. Time to shut down the show, yeah. Yeah, pull the plug. Come here, nubbins. Where... Where's that old "Fuck you, Charlie"? (SCREAMING) That little "Just in case, baby"? Where'd you put it? Yeah, there it is. Man... Man builds a good, sturdy trade by hooking and crooking. And then, kerplooey! The gods just kick him right in the balls. Oh, no, not this time. (LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY) No! No! I got the last laugh right here. (YELLING) (SCREAMING) CHOP-TOP: Going down, now! (STRETCH SCREAMS) (LAUGHING) (GROANING) (EXCLAIMING) (LAUGHING) (STRETCH SCREAMS) Going down! Going down, now! (CACKLING) (CHOP-TOP EXCLAIMS) (GRUNTING) Here I come, you hog bitch! You hog bitch! Dead end, girl. Dead end now. Dead-end city. Look at my face. Look. Look! It's like death eating a cracker, isn't it? Huh? Huh? No! Get away from her! Get away! (EXCLAIMS) Don't touch her! No! Grandma! No! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! You killed her, you hog bitch! (STRETCH SCREAMS) (SCREAMING MANIACALLY) (CHAINSAW WHIRRING) Die! (SCREAMING)
