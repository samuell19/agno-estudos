I know this man, William Clark Quantrell, I'm not proud of it. We were born in the same town, Canal Dover, Ohio, in 1837. But I thank the good lord that we weren't born under the same sign. At an early age, meanness and selfishness showed in his nature. As a young boy I remember well when he was... accused of shooting a pig in the rear, just to see he run. Pain, in a person or animal gave him pleasure. Was looking for a fight, would use anything he could raise his hands on. Whether desperation or just a state within always in for his life. The year I started with his newspaper... his picture was printed in the paper for the first time. But not for the last. The occasion, he got a job teaching in the Canal Dover school. Why he left a year later, no one seems to know. His work was satisfactory and seem well liked by both students and masters. But inside his cruel mind, rants were already forming. That would effect thousands of people before he came to a violent end. After he left his teaching job here in Ohio, he moved to Kansas. Where he found lobbying for a living was easier than teaching, Always a rabid anti-abolitionist. He formed a small band of men whose... sworn job was to return runaway slaves to their owners. Only the slaves that Quantrell and his men... picked up never seems to get back to their rightful owners. Human misery became his livelihood at an early age. When the break came between the North and the South and war was declared... under the guides of patriotism... Quantrell formed what were to be called Quantrell Border Ruffians. Under Quantrell's command... these men sympathetic for the South... fought actions against small union forces or... capture a Union soldier in a dark alley and just killed him. This was Quantrell idea of a true Southern patriot. He was a desperate character, steep in crime. He played a double roll with the people of the vicinity. He was a Border Ruffian and awful rabid abolitionist. And was at this time that he and his men... joined the guerrillas band that grown at the border between Kansas and Missouri. Now, with a war going on his murdering and robbing... in his mind came under the articles of war. And he consider it a patriotic duty. By now he had under his command several hundreds man. All of them were wanted by the law and banded together for self protection. There were a hard lot, who robbed and killed for they livelihood. Quantrell decided to go to Richmond... to seek a commission as a colonel in the confederate forces. To his distorted vision he saw promotion heat above him. But his reception in Richmond was cool. It was hard for him to understand that there were other things going on in the South. And that his exploits of a few border raids were not considered so important. Also his background of robbery and murder were well known of the Southern commanders. They turned his commission down with a stern warning to disband his man... and cease his border raids. When he came back to his command found a lot of the men had deserted. Abandoned and broken up. Depend on 2 or 3 small sections. It was a dissolution Quantrell that pulled his guerrilla band back together again. The turned down of his request for a commission by the confederate commanders... worked on his already warp mind... now only on thing interested him, revenge. Lawrence, Kansas, get pounding through his scheming mind. A few years before he'd gotten into trouble in Lawrence. Indictments for killing and robbing had been issued. And Quantrell had sneaked out of town just ahead of the sheriff. Keep him from being jailed and hung, his pride and dignity had been challenged. His vengeful mind kept pounding, Lawrence, Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas. August 1863. 450 men rode toward the small sleeping town of 2000 people. Quantrell at their lead, look ahead at the small doomed, defenseless city. It was a familiar scene as he rode, he read kidnap to free negro. Over there he burned the house, yonder it, counsel with his robbers friends. As the raiders pulled up and stop overlooking the town of Lawrence... he looked down on the street where he walked and profit. His face was grim as he looked at the escape route he used when Sheriff Walker... gun in hand and grooving him out of town like a mad dog. In the Lawrence Court House were papers which meant prison terms for his black crimes. Now he was to become master, monster, avenger of his own grimness. A sense of growing fill in as he signal the charge. They struck just before dawn. Quantrell orders, kill, kill and you will make no mistake. Lawrence must be clean and the only way to clean it, is to kill, kill. A carnage, the murder, the blood in the streets... are all written into an infamous period of American history. Five hours later, when the swept out of that town as fast as they move in... the town had been burned to the ground. Every man who could carry a gun in Lawrence was dead. Because of him, widows wailed, orphans cried, maidens wept... as they lifted del lifeless forms of their love ones from the bloody fields. Who borne them to untimely graves... Quantrell did have a strange code of honor. Not one woman in Lawrence was touched. There was no assault, a cruelty, apparently in his mind... this absorbed him from all guilt. As he considered just the men his enemies. But as he was to find out there's always someone... that take up and injustice, Lawrence was to be avenged. The civil war was over. But one infamous band of guerrillas fought on, Quantrell's Raiders. They had already written one of the bloodiest pages in history... by their savage raid of hate on Lawrence, Kansas. Wherever they rode they left a trail of murder... and destruction, pillaging, killing wantonly. Their leader, a man wanted dead or alive by both, the north and south, Quantrell. The men who followed this master of surprise attack were a strange mixture, outlaws... gunfighters, confederate soldiers displaced in the bitter aftermath... of the war between the States. No sign of cavalry ahead Colonel, I suggest we post a rear guard. - Brady, detail two men. - Yes sir. You find a place to rest this horses after the raid? Willie scouted that. Yes sir, I found a deserted farm west of town, it's hidden back of the road. We'll take half the men and attack the town from the north. - I'll lead them sir. - No, you won't, you stay with me. Clint will handle that detail. Alright, you men, follow me. Their mission, obtain guns, provisions and money. Their orders, shoot without warning. Their objective, a quiet, unsuspecting little town. I want every gun in town pile right here in the street. That's Quantrell, that's Quantrell. Hey man, will let them keep the change. Look out. Alright men, let's get out of here. You got exactly a half-hour, to feed and water the horses. - Post lookouts at both ends of the barn. - Yes sir. Hard on the raiders' heels was the man... ordered by the army to end the guerilla's reign of terror Captain Tom Andrews. For 30 days he had followed the bloody trail left by Quantrell. But it always been too late to stop the senseless slaughter.' Now, once again the trail led to the north. Forward. I got to talk to you please. It's the old Carson place, nobody lives there. Now, you take it easy son. - I was hunting rabbits... - Now you just take it easy, what you see? - They went in the barn. - Who? Who went the barn? - A whole lot of them and they all had guns. - Where is this Carson place? - Way back off the road. - Good boy. - That ought to hold you Colonel. - Yeah, that'll do Clint. Call the boys together. Alright men, line up. Montana, step out. I said step out. - What is this, court martial? - You could call it that. Not a sound out of you. We're moving on but you're not going with us. What am I supposed to be guilty of? You saw that sniper, you're responsible for this. Now, wait a minute colonel. If you're wrong, you're going to lose one of the best men you got. I'm not wrong Brady. Now, in a regular trial, at least you ought to have a witness. - He's got one. - You're a liar. No, I'm not, Montana. You've been wanting to take over this command for a long time. Now, I'll take your gun. Quantrell, you're surrounded. There'll be time enough for this later, get your rifles. You don't stand a chance in hell, throw out those guns. Blue-coats. Let's see those guns, I'm not bluffing. Fire a volley. Clint, you and Willie get those rifles we took today, throw them out, we need time. You two, up in the hayloft and cover it. Quantrell, let's see those guns. I'll take half you men out the front. Brady, you take the rest out the back. - Yes sir. - Let's all get mounted. Quantrell, I'm going to give you till the count of five. One, two, three... four... Come on, get on your horse, let's get out of here. Not until the old man clear out, but I'll open the doors for you. Good luck Brady. Alright... now come on out, one at a time, with your hands up. Let's have it. You could've gotten away Willie. Yeah, now we both could hadn't been for that Montana. I should've killed him when I had the chance. While Quantrell lay gravely wounded in a military hospital... the raiders that were captured stood trial in this courtroom. Everybody rise. Be seated. Clint Stewart, William Martin, you have both been found guilty as charge. At this time, sentence will be passed upon you. - Your honor... - Yes Captain Andrews? Your honor I'd like to speak on behalf of these two men. You the were chief witness for the prosecution. That's right Your Honor. But these two are different than the others you sent to prison. In what way? They both rode with Quantrell. Yes sir, but they didn't join the raiders until after the war. They didn't take part in the Lawrence massacre. Why wasn't this testimony given at the trial? I, I didn't find out about it until this morning sir. What difference does it make anyway? This is a northern court, we'll get northern justice. When you joined Quantrell, you knew his reputation. We had no choice, they wouldn't give a confederate a job. Stinking carpetbaggers took over the whole south. You got to admit sir, there wasn't much for them to come home to. And when I went home to, rock chimney and a pile of ashes. The men that rode with Quantrell in the Lawrence raid were given life sentences... but because Captain Andrews has come to your defense... and because of the war and the confusion it left in men's minds... 20 years of hard labor. This court is adjourned. I'm sorry, I did my best. Thanks for nothing. - How do you know so much about us? - Got a letter from his brother. - Where is he? - Hospital in Atlanta, wounded in action. He's going to be alright, this is for you. He read about the trial and decided to write me about you two. And your fine war records. Well, nobody cares much if you're on the losing side. I respect a good soldier no matter what the color of his uniform. Alright, move along. I'll write your brother where he can get in touch with you. The kid would be better off if he forget he ever had me for a brother. Thanks anyway. Match this. I'll call you and I'll raise. Alright, I call. Sorry mister, I got a pretty good hand. Full house. Wait a minute, I got a better one. I've been looking all over west Texas for you. Glad you found me tonight Brady. Alright, everybody out, out. - Brady, good to see you. - Where have you been? Oh, I've been hiding out, doing a little penny-ante work till my arm healed up. How is it now? Faster than ever been. Good, good, we'll find a better way to use your talent than this. With you any time Brady, here. You know, I ain't forgot how you stood up for me with Quantrell. Quantrell dropped those charges, he's dead. Died in a military hospital about a week ago. Well, I hate to see any man go that way, even Quantrell. Wonder how many of the boys got away when we broke out that barn. Well, I think that the better part of the best of them got out. I can't see what you're getting at. The way I look at it, you're the natural heir to the gang. The boys would be eager to follow that gun of yours. Brady, you got a head on your shoulders. I'll put together a better gang than Quantrell ever had. Let's drink to it. As soon as we get the boys together... we'll shake this Texas dust off our heels and light out for Arizona. - Brady, what's in Arizona we'd want? - Gold, lots of it. Every gold train on the way out of the mint in Washington passes right through Arizona. - And no Texas Rangers around to stop us? - No. Again they rode, the men of Quantrell. These man rode only for greed. Defying what law there was, ravaging a territory helpless to stop them. Helpless until the night of June 17th 1866... when Capt Tom Andrews, late of the US army, rode into Tombstone for a secret rendezvous. - I'm here to see the governor. - Tom, come on in. Good to see you Tom, I wasn't expecting you for a day or so. - I'm sorry to interrupt your supper sir. - Just finished, sit down. Your letter said urgent. I left the day I was discharged from the army. Good, we need a man out here who gets things done. And I think you're going to need more than that. - You've read the papers? - Is it as bad as it sounds? Worse, four banks held up, six gold trains captured, all in the last six months. - And no one knows yet who the outlaws are. - And I can make a pretty good guess. That's what I was hoping. I've been studying the way they operate, same military pattern that Quantrell used. - But you wiped out Quantrell. - Quantrell yes but some of his men got away. We don't have enough lawmen out here to fight that kind of bunch. Only last week, the raiders challenged a posse to an open fight. - I can imagine what happened. - Posse was wiped out to a man. We must organize like they did in Texas. You mean the rangers? We've got to organize our own territorial police force. I want you to head it up. It'll take time to get a good bunch of lawmen together. We don't have time. If those raiders aren't stopped soon, they're going to take over the entire territory. I don't know. Trying to fight the outlaws and organize a troop of rangers at the same time... - I doubt I could pull it out. - I never heard you say that about anything. I tell you what, there's just one way, one that we might be able to stop that gang... - but you won't like what I want to do. - You let me decide that. You better order some more coffee... because if this thing backfires, it could cost you the governorship. Waiter. The governor agreed to the most unusual request. Two weeks later a cargo of hard-work convicts under heavy guard... were transferred from a Texas prison to the jurisdiction of the territory of Arizona... purpose unknown. Pull up over there. - You alright Willie? - I've felt better. Why do you suppose they're transferring us to Umo prison? Who cares? It couldn't be worse than the one we were in. I don't know, I hear that Umo is the hellhole of creation. Alright, get out and stretch. The first one that makes a wrong move, we'll bury him out here. Going anywhere Willie? Yeah, I hadn't made plans, no. It's good to get out of that torture chamber though. Martin, Stewart, move out. - What the hell is this? - We need firewood, you're elected. You've been chasing us around ever since you took over this expedition. - When I say move out, move. - I think the man means it. Was better natured when he was wearing that blue uniform. Let's go, over there. I'll tell you when to pick it up. We need big stuff, on down there. Hold it. Sit down boys, take it easy. Take it easy? Now, that's a switch. You've been out in the desert sun too long Captain? Prison life isn't exactly the best way to spend your days, is it? Well, I had had it easier. Why don't you stop stalling? Something on your mind besides our health? This the badge of the Arizona Rangers. I'm going to make it something a man will be proud to wear. Well, bully for you. Why you telling us? Because I want you and Willie to join me. Jo...? Now let's see, just let me get this straight. First you put us in, now you're going to let us out. There's got to be an awful big catch to this. There is. You got to help us round up the outlaws working Arizona. Then you get an unconditional pardon. Now, wait a minute, what made you pick us? Because you're the only ones that can handle this job. I see, you understand Willie? Two men who rode with Quantrell. Exactly, so are the ones we're after. - Hear Montana Smith heads that outfit. - It's my guess. You take these bracelets off of us... what makes you sure we won't head for Mexico and never come back? No, I'm not sure of anything, I'm willing to risk it. It's your gamble but our hand say the odds are against you. It's the kind of odds I like. Now... you'll get horses from the guards... and then you, you better take me with you away. - Are the guards in on this? - You're on your own. With an empty gun. Come on. Alright boys, you can drop those rifles Do what I tell, get up here, hurry. You better do as he says. How about it Willie? We fought together, let's escape together. - Give us a break, will you pals? - Please? Come on Willie, throw me a gun. I'm taking you with me. Hey, what about us? Take us with you. Hey, Clint, take us with you. Sorry friend, you just slow us down. Get on that horse. Where I'll find Montana? That'll be part of your job. Right now you'll need supplies and some different clothes. I'll be glad enough to shed these. It's a water hole up that drum. One of my men will meet you there, be a lot of help. Wait with him, I'll get back to you with further instructions. You Captain Andrews' man? Right. Ranger Danny Bonner, make yourself at home, I'll be right there. You really can go for this ranger stuff? Well, I want out of prison and I want Montana. - And then what? - We'll see. Danny? Clint, you didn't expect see your kid brother out here, did you? Hello Roy. Danny, you've grown a foot since I saw you last. Now, you two look like you could use a cup of coffee, come on. Hey, what's all this Bonner business? What's wrong with your real name? Explained all that in my letter. They don't deliver any letters at that prison. You were ashamed of being my brother, weren't you? Can't say as I blame you. No Clint, I was never ashamed of you. Only reason I changed my name was... because I was afraid they wouldn't let me join the rangers if they... - If they knew about me. - I've always been proud of you Clint. Look, I've carried this with me ever since you sent it home from Shiloh. Symbol of a lost cause. Now you're now with the rangers, I'll tell everybody we're brothers. - No Danny, don't do that. - Why not? The Captain already knows about. Let us just let it ride along the way it is for the time being. Anything you say Clint, let me get you some more coffee. Of course you heard about Mother and Dad? It's the reason I never went home after I got out of the hospital. You ever find out who killed them? Carpetbaggers, burned the house down with the folks trapped inside in. If only I'd gone home a week earlier, I maybe I could... I was with him Danny. When we heard that Quantrell was killing carpetbaggers... we didn't care what else he did. I see now why you joined the raiders, I wish I'd been with you. I'm glad you weren't Danny. You know, I have a lot of respect for Cap. Andrews, teaming you two up together. Well, I think I'll use your bathtub here Danny. See the way they're dressed? It's a Yaqui tribe alright. - Wonder how friendly they are. - Hombres, muchos hombres. They must be part civilized, at least they got a church. Oh yeah, yeah. Well, it be a good place to hole up till the gold shipment comes through. - Who's in charge around here? - My father, Chief Ortega. Chief, I want to make a little deal with you. - He does not speak your language. - That's got to be a big help. I will translate for you. Alright. You tell your daddy here that, we going to stay here for a while. My father say there is no food, no room for so many. It is true se?or, there's barely enough food for these people to feed themselves. I'll say a prayer for them, got everything we need right here. My father say you can't stay here. Well now, you tell your pappy we're going to stay here whether he likes it or not. Well, go on, tell him. Now, let's give it to the old man. No, as long as we got a gun at the chief's head his people won't give us any trouble. Maybe you're right. Let's get them into the church, come on, let's go. Come on, move. Everybody but you honey. We going to keep you around for a while to maybe, maybe do the cooking, eh Brady? Might be a long wait. Alright, keep an eye on them. Alright men, search all the huts. Make sure you got all of them. - That's some shooting, eh Danny? - Not too bad. A trifle slow maybe. I admit I'm a little rusty but if you going to be so critical, let's see what you can do. - You better get ready. - I'm ready, let's have it. Hey, that's not bad, for a kid. Let's have it. I've never seen anything quite like that before, let's see it again Willie. Lucky fluke, you know something, kid is getting too big for his britches. Where did you learn to shoot like that? Well, I copy Clint's style... that is, the style he had before he slowed down. Hey, watch it ranger. - Hi Captain. - Hi Danny. About time you got here. You're no more anxious to get moving than I am. I spread word about your escape. Montana won't be surprise when you show up. Well, tell me where I can find him. There is, they were last seen near the town of Panal. - It'll be a good place to start. - I'll get the horses. Give you a hand. As soon as you locate that gang I want you to join up with them but be careful. When you find out when and where they plan to make they're next strike... get word to me in Panal. You placing a lot of trust in me captain. Well, I figured you had a pretty good taste of what is like on the other side of the law. That's right. What if we decided to tip off that gang and hightail it for the border? In that case, I'd order the best man in my outfit to hunt you down... and shoot, to kill. Danny? That could pose a problem. Before you leave, I'll have to swear you into the rangers, raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to render loyal service to the territory of Arizona? I do. - I do. - Good luck. So long Clint. Goodbye Danny. Do not stay here, se?or. You don't exactly make a customer feel welcome. You are one of the men who escaped, I see your poster this morning. - You keep your eyes open, don't you? - Sometimes it pays. I've been looking for some friends of mine, they've been working around here. They might be in an Indian village, south, near the border. Think we may be onto something. Down there, should be round the bend any minute. Are sure they're loaded with gold? Well, that's the big one we've been waiting for. At the rate they're moving... they should be exactly where we want them by tomorrow morning. Should we better go back and report to Montana? He'll go along with what we aim to do. This place looks deserted. You think that girl was pulling your leg? I don't know. We can sure find out. Meet me at the church. Look here honey, look what I just found. - Hello Eddie. - Willy? Keep it just quiet, eh? - Good old Montana. - What the devil is going on? Clint just wants to spend about 20 seconds with your boss, that's all. Yeah, I knew he'd be back before long. What is this? Sure ain't whiskey. - Forbidden drink. - Well, not for me it ain't. What do they call this stuff honey? Peyote, devil curse. - Yeah, I heard about it, that's good stuff. - No, make men crazy. Want kill. You know, I heard tell how it, makes women a little wild too. Now we just try a little bit and see what it does for you. - Come on, come on a little bit. - No. - A little bit. - No. Ah sure, do bring out the devil in you, don't it? Why don't we try a little more, eh honey? How about me? I've been expecting you Clint. Well, I'm here. Oh, then why don't you forget what happened? You can ride with us again. Sure, till my back is turned. The cross, the cross. - Thanks for the warning. - Se?or, will you help me? How? My mother and father are being held in the church. Where the rest of your people? Hiding in the hills or dead. Two weeks ago... he and his men come into our village to kill, to... - Well, you see how he treat me. - Yes. Se?or please, we must hurry. - Put those guns away. - You first Brady. - What chance do you got against all of us? - This much. What do we got to fight about? Lost one and gained two. When I heard you broke loose, I know you had you sting out for Montana. You got a grudge against any of the rest of us? No, that's it. Good, I don't imagine they serve any whiskey where you've been. How about a drink? Why not? I'd appreciate it if you got back to your cooking. The boys will be wanting something to eat before long, come on, get it. Come on, let's have a drink. Stolen from one of the best hotels in Arizona. Well, they sure didn't give this kind of stuff to us prisoners. Tell me, wasn't Captain Andrews guarding those prison wagons when you made your break? That's right, he's head of the Arizona Rangers now. And why you let him go, why didn't you kill him? Then they would had all their dogs out after us. Yeah, - I guess you're right. - Who cares about a couple of ex-prisoners? - But if we killed the head of the rangers? - Somebody ought to get him. They will. What do you think of our cook? I think you better watch her or she's likely to poison you. Why don't you let her go? She'll treat us alright, as long as we've got a gun on the chief. We don't have to chance her cooking much longer. There's enough gold coming through here to care of all of us for life. And that's what we've been waiting for and then we're heading for the promised land... Mexico. Maybe we'll see you there. How come? I won't take a chance on going back where you can't get this, we're heading out. Why don't you stay? We could use you Clint. No thanks, some other time. Mexico is just beyond that mountain range, isn't it? Yeah, I scouted them real good, the best pass is right through there. Thanks for the whiskey. Thanks. You had to open your fat mouth. Did it ever occur to you they might try to beat us to that gold train? I thought they were going to be riding with us. Now, you and Matt follow them, make good and sure they really are heading for Mexico. Now go on, get. Clint... - you really planning on going to Mexico? - I sure am. Oh, what about the captain and your brother? What about them? You were using them, you never intended to keep your promise. It's the promise I made to myself that counts with me. I kept that one, coming? Hi Clint, how you make out? - We made out. - Now, why don't you just tell him? Tell me what? Captain sent you to keep an eye on us, eh? He doesn't have the faith in you I have. Well, I guess you know this trail leads to Mexico. I, I figured you might be circling back to town so... - in case somebody... - No good Danny. I wasn't cut out to be a lawman. Why don't you go on back and tell the Captain I resigned? You can't do that Clint. Sorry Danny, sorry it has to be this way. Stay right where you are, don't turn around. You're under arrest Clint. I took an oath, just like you did. Maybe it didn't mean anything to you but it does to me. You with him or me? Reckon I'll have to string along with the kid here Clint. How come a kid like that ever get a gun on those two? I don't know. Bring my horse Willie. - We got a long ride back to the captain. - Easy Dan. Got to talk to you, I got to convince you. You just lie back there and take it easy. Clint, I don't have much time and I got to talk some sense into you. - You've already talked some sense into me. - You mean it? You seeing things the right way? Yes Danny, I'm seeing things the right way. I knew you wouldn't run out on me, I knew it all along. Clint, it's getting kind of dark. No, it's a little cloudy Danny. Clint, I can't see it. It's Matt and Duke. Well, looks like I get you two out of trouble. - Oh, I'll be damned, a ranger. - And you're looking at two more. I ain't going to draw against you Clint. I ain't going to draw against you. See? I'm taking my gun belt off. Let them have him Willie. Well, which is it? Are we going to Mexico or we heading on back? You know the answer to that. But we're going to have to work fast Brady will miss those two. What is it Matt? Martina, come over here. See if you can do something for him. Practice torture. Our people know it well. And you have driven them back to this. If you do not go... it will be for all of you. - That's Matt. - Too late to back out now. Changed your mind? Yeah, one taste of those Indians and we suddenly got gold fever. How is he? The Yaqui are good at this sort of torture, he's dead. - You know anything about this? - Only the Indians were chasing him and Duke. We tried to help but they killed Duke and carried him off before we could. And you fellas came through without a scratch. Thanks to his shooting, he got four of those Yaqui before they got away. - How about it, still use us? - We need every man we can get. You'll find grain for your horses around back. Sure it doesn't make sense, Duke and Matt running from those Indians. The Yaquis don't have any guns. Our boys were carrying rifles. Why didn't they stop and fight them off? I don't know. Everybody is oiling their guns... looks like they're getting ready to pull out in the morning. Do you think Brady fell for that story we told him about the Indian fight? Not too much. - That means they'll be out looking for Duke. - They won't bother. They're bound to be getting ready hit that gold train in the morning. That's all it could be. - We better get word to Captain Andrews. - That'll be you, I'll stay behind and cover for you. What, what're you going to tell them when they miss me? If you'd get back here before daylight, they won't miss you. Suppose I don't? I'll think of something. I'll tell them you decided to take that little trip to Mexico after all. - You think they'll believe you? - It's about a 50-50 chance. Se?or, I must talk with you. But, why don't you run away from here? You can get away. - I cannot leave my mother and father. - You can't do anything to help them. I can pray. I suppose that won't hurt. How you learn to speak English? The padre, before they kill him, he teach me to speak English and... They killed the padre? Yes, just as he was teaching my people a new way of life. Like torturing that man we let the Yaquis capture this morning? No, that was the old way. The way of the savage Yaqui. They were driven out of Mexico to wander through the desert. Se?or, my husband and my children were killed on that flight from Mexico. - I'm sorry. - I want the new way of life for my people. The way the padre was teaching. To build, to plant things, to live in peace. - Why you telling me this? - I trust you. You've no reason to. Are not rangers supposed to be good men? - What do you know about the rangers? - I just come from my people out there. They give me this. Danny's. My people say you killed one of the outlaws and give them another... - and still you come back. - I came back because of this. Se?or... - rangers are supposed to be good people. - Yes. - Then I hope many come. - They will, he went after them. Your friend, se?or? He was followed and you are in great danger. Willie made it to his horse, I saw him. Si, but he was followed very close by four men. He'll make it, he's got to. You were in a bit of a hurry, where you going? Mexico. Wrong direction, Mexico is that way. You were headed straight for town. - I want to talk to you Brady. - Talk. - Alone. - We all know what you want to say. You mean about being a ranger? I had to join to them to get out of the prison... you got to be able to figure that out. And Willie took off last night just for a moonlight ride. Told me he's going to Mexico. Guess his conscience get to bothering him. When it's come to a choice between cash or conscience, well, I'll take the cash. Bring him out. He wasn't heading for Mexico. He was going to report to Captain Andrews. Well boys, we got a couple of rangers crawled in with us. What do you do with a pair of rattlers? Dirty double-crosser. You took an oath, the same as I did. You hear that? He took an oath. You're no ranger. Now, you listen to me Willie... get this ranger nonsense out of your head and come on and ride with us. I made a promise and it means something to me. - We all make promises. - I keep mine. Well, what shall we do with them? Give me some time with him. Maybe can talk some sense into his head, make him forget that oath. I'm afraid we couldn't trust him. Then lock him in the church over there... we'll be long gone by the time he gets out of there. I've got a better idea. With all that gold at stake, we couldn't take any chances. You two were good friends once but he sure turned on you, didn't he? Yeah, he sure did. I'll give it to you, when I think you need it. Get your horse. Alright, mount up. Must be a million bucks in gold on those pack-horses. And at least 20 soldiers guarding it, maybe more. Not much chance of surprising them, not out here anyway. Who said we going to hit them out here? We'll wait until they get into town. That's logical. As soon as the soldiers clear, we stampede the pack train out of town. Want me to do that? That's where Willie was heading last night. You stay here and pick up any strays. You don't trust me, eh? No, I trust you alright. Jim, you and Eddie stay here with Clint. Sure thing boss. Well Captain, looks like the gold got through this far alright. But that doesn't mean the gang hasn't been watching it. Maybe they'll hit it between here and Bixby. - But they never work that territory. - That could change. It's strange one of those three didn't contact me. When that gold train leaves here tomorrow, we'll be with it. If any of those pack-horses are loose, pick them up. And he almost had me convinced. I'll take a couple of men and go after him. No, no, para. We'll be across the border before he cause any trouble. Alright, moving out. - I was about to give up on you. - I don't blame you. - Danny and Willie? - Both dead. - I'm sorry. - I need a gun. Going to take us a while to pick up their trail. - I'll take you straight to them. - Good, move out. They'll be in Mexico before we catch up with them. Not unless those Indians let me down. - We never get the horses through that. - Well, keep them out. Jim, take half the men back up the canyon, hold off the posse. Alright, we haven't got much time, let's clear a path with the stuff. Alright Diablo, come on. Watch out for that cactus. Right, keep it moving. Willie? One last favor, se?or. Will you tell the church to send us a padre soon? First chance I get. Thank you, I've been well trained. I'll be a good nun. I'm sure you will. - Goodbye Martina. - Goodbye.
