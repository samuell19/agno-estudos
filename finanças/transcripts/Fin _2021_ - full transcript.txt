[Indistinct chatter] Wow. So this is it. Tell me about what they found on this boat. Man: This vessel came here to Liberia with a long line fishing license. What they were doing was using gillnets that are prohibited by law because they're so particularly destructive. The primary catch was shark. We refer to them as the galician mafia because they're fishing syndicates involved in other types of criminal activity, which makes them criminal syndicates that are involved in this kind of business. [Indistinct chatter] Oh, that's fucking cold. Agh. Man: Watch your step. It's very slippery. Holy shit. Yeah. Look here. Here, look there. Look. Holy shit. Look at all this. It's all fin. [Panting] Roth, narrating: Growing up, I was obsessed with scary movies. And the rush of horror films. I started making movies. And I said, "I want to be a director. This is what I want to do forever." Oh! This is all I want to do. [Chainsaw buzzing, man screams] I want to be the one pushing the button that shocks the audience. Aah! Roth, narrating: Growing up, nothing scared me more than sharks. And that was all because of one film-- "jaws." Man on film: A mindless eating machine. Roth, narrating: I was terrified of sharks, but also fascinated by them. Hi, there. It's me again. Eli roth. I'm at the house of Gabriel asner, and I'm going to interview him. Gabriel? What's your name? Gabriel. Roth: The head of discovery asked, "have you ever hosted a talk show?" I'm like, "no, but I think I was born to be a talk show host." He goes, "you'd be great for 'shark after dark.'" [people screaming] I'm your host Eli roth, welcome to "shark after dark," our late night show with shark week experts, interviews, clips, and plenty of conversation. You lost your arm and a leg to a bull shark in 2009, and now you are an advocate for their conservation. Very few people actually get eaten by a shark. They always come, they take a bite, and then they take off when they realize that you're not food. Roth: The craziest thing I learned was that without sharks, the planet can die. Sharks are doctors of the sea. When they're not there, diseases turn into epidemics. Man: They've been around long before mammals or other fish or even dinosaurs came on the scene. Oceans touch every one of us and the life of every one of us in many ways. Every second breath we take comes from the ocean because 50% of the world's oxygen is produced by phytoplankton. So the ocean is still a major part of our life support system today. Sharks shape these ecosystems over the evolutionary history. Sharks act much like the police on land. Once in a while they eat something, most of the time, they scare everything. And they keep certain species out of certain habitats where those species could do damage. So the sharks are restoring some kind of balance to the ecosystem when they're pressed. When sharks are taken away, we see that balance change. And we see large negative changes in the ecosystems that often cannot be reversed easily. Roth: Discovery said to me, "do you want to go for a shark dive? "I bet we can do that. We can film it and make it part of 'shark after dark.'" and I was like, "are you kidding me? My whole life I've wanted to do that." I was nervous. I was scared. But it's truly amazing when you can face your fears, because you realize how much of it is just in your head. Roth, narrating: For me, this happened in the waters of The Bahamas. I learned to stop fearing sharks. I could not believe how social they were. They were curious, shy, intelligent animals. Some were friendlier than others. It was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. Roth, narrating: They were the most beautiful animal I had ever seen. I couldn't imagine harming even one of these majestic, intelligent creatures. Roth: So what do you think is happening to the planet? What's happening is there's an insatiable demand for shark fin soup. And they're getting walloped all over. And which is used for shark fin soup, an Asian delicacy. The conservative number of sharks killed every year is 100 million sharks. For a long time in estimating shark mortality, we've relied on official figures from the food and agriculture organization of the United Nations. Right now we know about 25 species that are either endangered or critically endangered which could go extinct within the next decade or two. The special problem with shark finning is everybody can do it. Small artisanal boats off Baja, California and Mexico can do it. Everybody is part of this. Roth: Sharks are a difficult subject because of the perception that sharks are these monsters that want to eat us. [Woman screaming] I want to help change the conversation. I'm not a scientist. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a marine biologist. But I am someone who loves sharks, and I care about the ocean. And I want to understand what's happening to it. Roth, narrating: I'm traveling the world to find out. No matter how uncomfortable, dangerous, or upsetting it gets... I have to expose the truth. [Speaking Spanish] Roth: Oh, shit. He's right there. That's a mako? Ok? [Man speaking Spanish] [Speaking Spanish] Roth: Can we let it go? Is he gonna kill it? [Woman speaking Spanish] Can we pay for it? Can we pay for it and let it live? [Gasps] [Thud] It's the worst thing I've ever seen. [Flies buzzing] [Speaking Spanish] Roth: How many sharks a year can a small fishing community take out of the water? 500 sharks? From 4 boats? Yeah. Roth: Are they aware that they're depleting the shark population? [Seagulls cry] You just pulled a baby out? Yeah. Oh, my god. [Speaking Spanish] Roth: You look at it and you think, it's a fish, it's a fish. And then they slice open the stomach and there's babies that are probably 2 or 3 weeks away from coming out in the world. That was a mother. That was a mother feeding her kids. I don't care what species it is. In one hook they killed 9 sharks. May to August is the breeding season, but here we are in the middle of April, and they killed a pregnant shark. How is the population ever gonna survive? [Flies buzzing] Man: Sharks are biologically different than fish. When fish reproduce, what they do is they-- the males will release millions of sperm into water column and females will move millions of eggs. They mix together and create millions of little eggs and larvae. Sharks are different. Males and females mate. Females have long gestation times. Some sharks are pregnant for over 3 years. And when they give birth to either eggs or live young, it might take several years again before they reproduce. Worm: Sharks are a little bit like us. They mature late in their life, between 10, 20, sometimes 30 years of age. They have few offspring like us. And they're slow to recover from any large mortality event because they never had to. When you're top predator, you don't have to evolve the ability to withstand extra mortality, much like people. Now people are the top predators and sharks are the underdogs. Roth: You can't blame the fishermen for trying to make a living. But this is happening every day. We're killing them, slaughtering them, ripping their fins off, and for what? This is for soup at a wedding. It's crazy. [Flies buzzing] Nowadays a good quality fin would be like a smooth hammerhead or a hammerhead, they pay like 700 pesos, setecientos pesos. [Man speaking Spanish]Or a thousand pesos per kilo. How long do they dry them out? For 10 days. Why is that?[Speaking Spanish] Because this has a fiber inside, so it's a cartilage. People just eat the cartilage? Yeah, in a shark fin soup. How much do they know about it? So it's a Chinese company in Tijuana? Do we know what that company is? [Speaking Spanish] Domingo: I never take out the fin topic in the very beginning. Most of them are really afraid to talk about it. Is that because they know something's wrong? I think that they know there is a big market for it and normally that market, it's black. But in fact, what they are doing, it's not illegal. It's the starting point of a whole chain. Roth: This can't continue. There will be nothing left in the ocean. There will be nothing left for these people. I've heard about Hong Kong my whole life. It's kind of sad that it took sharks to get me here, but I'm glad I made it. [Ship horn blows] Man: Hey, Eli. How are you, mate? Good to see you. All right. We're good to go. Let's do it, buddy. So this is ground zero for the shark trade. Yep, this is where more than 50% of the world's shark fin passes through. Stokes, voice-over: Basically you have over 83 countries that are shipping shark fin into Hong Kong. We're talking like 17,000-plus tons a year coming through here. It comes into here, and then most of it goes across the border into China. I first started off really as an ocean lover. I, you know, grew up in the mediterranean diving. Seeing the eradication of our oceans got me on the road to my activism. Further down the line, joined sea Shepherd. Sea Shepherd is a marine conservation organization set up in 1977 by captain Paul Watson. My main role with sea Shepherd over here in Hong Kong has been exposing and investigating the shark fin trade. One of the biggest misconceptions is that shark fin is illegal, and in reality, it is actually legal. What we are actually trying to do is find the illegality, trying to find these endangered species that are actually being smuggled in with the other fins. That's when it becomes illegal. [Ship horn blows] Over here we've got the main container port for Hong Kong. Ok. Being such a major port, we see tens of thousands of containers coming through every single week. But the thing to note is, there's no customs check, per se. It's not like an airport where you have to go through customs. Sadly, Hong Kong can only inspect less than one percent of containers. Most actually arriving, nobody even checks them, nobody knows what's inside them. The customs base their inspections on priority. But when it comes listed as dried seafood, it is not a priority. So you can stick anything in a container, label it dried seafood, and the chances are of it getting to Hong Kong without even being inspected. Look at how many containers are on there, and how can customs in any form actually manage that? We have one of the most advanced container ports in the world here, and it handles so much, but how can it physically check every box? Roth: What percentage of the sharks being brought into Hong Kong would you say are illegal endangered sharks? Surveys and research that scientists have been doing by taking samples around the markets, checking the DNA, we're looking at around 25% of the entire market here is from endangered or cites listed illegal sharks. Worm: Cites is the convention on international trade on endangered species, and it regulates the international trade of species such as elephants and rhinos and tigers and sharks more recently. So when a species is listed under appendix one of cites, it cannot be traded internationally. If it is listed under appendix two, it can't be traded if a country can demonstrate that the species is thriving and doing well in their particular jurisdiction. Right now, almost a dozen species of sharks are listed under cites or under consideration for listing under cites, meaning they are at that point where they're immediately threatened with extinction and we have to curb international trade with these species in order to save them. But one of the problems with cites is the species listed can still be legally caught in any one country unless other regulations exist. Finning is very low tech. You just cut the fins off, you dry them in the sun, and they keep for years. So it's really hard to assess where they come from. Illegal fins are finding their ways to traders that then bring them over to east Asia. It's the dark trade that we can't see, we can't regulate, we don't have any data for. Why was Hong Kong the number one spot in the world for shark fins? Hundreds of years ago, the shark fin was the dish of the emperor. It was served at the emperor's banquet. Around the sixties, it suddenly became an idea that people put onto wedding banquets to show how wealthy you were and how successful you were. And there's different stories of where it started, but there was two hotels that suddenly started putting it on their wedding banquets. Have your wedding banquet here, you could eat like the emperor. So this is something from the last 50 years, the shark fin soup.Yeah. But the big problem is just across the border in China, you've got a massive population who are just finding new wealth. They all want to be like the emperor. Gorgeous photo done where it's all golden looking and shiny and rich and fancy graphics, and it looks expensive. And yet the insanity is, I could put it next to the picture of where it really came from. These shark fin traders are just-- they are having the last laugh. This is the insanity of the marketing industry behind the shark fin industry. You are taking something that has just been skankily dried in a gutter. This is what I call gutter food. It's lying there in a gutter next to dog shit, next to cigarette butts, rat poison. What if we put posters of a billboard of shark fins next to dog shit around Hong Kong and said, "this is what you're eating"? That's something I'm actually working on at the moment. I saw the photos that you took of 40,000 some-odd fins on a rooftop. Tell me about how that happened. So that was actually just over here on this building here where the yellow thing is, just behind that. I actually got a tip-off on new years day very early in the morning. I called our head office in the states, got permission, chartered a helicopter. Jump into the cameras. We're talking an insane amount of shark fins. We literally run up onto the roof. Shoot, shoot, shoot. It was actually an old Chinese couple with straw hats, and they were just on the roof just turning the fins over. And you don't know what time you've got before a load of other people turn up. I was worried about me being the only guy on the roof. Some angry traders, yeah.On an abandoned rooftop. Angry people.Yeah. Someone might slip. And falling off the roof. You know? We've seen the massive decline in shark populations. It's been literally since the 1960s. Because of soup.Because of the soup. [Indistinct chatter] Hi. Hey. Hi, Eli. How are you?Very well. Pleasure. Hi, how are you?This is chef to. Nice to meet you. Tell me, how does, uh, how does it work? [Speaking Chinese] Roth: Ahh, ok. And that rehydrates it? Yes. It'll sit in the ice bath for [speaking Chinese]. Overnight. So afterwards you get, uh, to this stage. This is the finished product. So do you clean-- is it cleaned before, or it just comes like that? Well, I mean, fins generally are pretty, uh, clean. [Speaking Chinese] Yeah. These are really pristine. Woman: Shark fin is discolored. And it also has a very strong smell. To make it more appealing for somebody to eat, they'll strip the skin off and start vigorously scrubbing it. To get rid of the smell and to get rid of that yellowing, unappealing texture, they have to use strong chemicals such as bleach. What you're eating is not pure shark cartilage. You're eating toxic chemicals. [Speaking Chinese] Roth: So what's he doing now? What is superior broth? It's outdated. What do they put in the fake shark fin soup? Ok.[to speaking Chinese] This feels like jelly.It is. It's calcium. Other than the thickness, they feel exactly the same. Yeah, this doesn't smell at all. Seriously, go, go, go take a bite. Of this. No, This has no taste. How are you?Man: Good. So nice to meet you. We have a lot in common. We love food. But we also love "riki-oh: The story of Ricky." [Laughs] You made "riki-oh." Yeah. Yeah. "Riki-oh" is one of the most violent movies ever made. Oh, yeah. Uhh! Aah!aah! How did you then become a food critic? From making films? It's true. It's a lot nicer to eat. Here it is. Oh, wow. Yep. I had a pet pig, so I don't eat ham. And I love diving with sharks. So this is literally my worst nightmare combined into one bowl. This is like cannibal holocaust. The great inferno. It's like me eating my friends. Let me try the fakey. It's tasty. I don't know the difference. I've never had it before. But this to me tastes kind of like wonton soup. Ha ha ha! Ok. The texture, I don't kind of feel or taste anything. Ok.it's kind of fun. And chewy a little bit. And now the shark fin soup. If I'm being honest, it tastes exactly the same. It's gooey-er and thicker. I'm thinking about the animal more. I can't pretend that this tastes worse than this, 'cause it doesn't, it tastes exactly the same. Why do people love it? That's it?That's it. So this would be, I mean, $100 a bowl or something? Thereabouts, yeah. They're buying into prestige. They're buying into a tiny sliver of, you know, emperor royal history, so to speak. In america, we do the exact same thing. It's just human nature.Absolutely. People want to order the most expensive thing to show they can afford it and pretend they like it, even if they don't.Lam: That's it. Does the older generation think about sustainability, the environment? Do they just--or it's... Fake news, yeah. No. Roth: Tell me about wildaid and what you guys are doing here. Wildaid, we're a conservation ngo that we're focused solely on reducing the demand for endangered species. So in Hong Kong that primarily means the elephant and the sharks. We've managed to get the ivory trade banned here in January. And so now we're fixing our attention firmly on sharks. You did a campaign that I heard about in the U.S. with yao ming. Announcer: What if you could see how shark fin soup is made? Hofford: We had a campaign back in about 2013 calling on the Chinese public to reduce their consumption of shark fin. When the buying stops...When the buying stops... When the buying stops...The killing can, too. Can, too.Killing can, too. Hofford: And so the Chinese government stopped selling shark fin at official banquets in 2013. 6 months after that happened, the Hong Kong government also stopped serving shark fin at all official banquets here. But it's a huge country, and even if the consumption is still not as much, it's still a hell of a lot. What we're seeing now is that the consumption of shark fin is actually spreading around China, places like Cambodia or Southeast Asia, Vietnam. We're pretty much the only ngo I think, apart from sea Shepherd, publicly calling for a shark fin trade ban in Hong Kong. Scientists have actually determined that there is no such thing as sustainable blue shark fisheries. They can't get them to reproduce fast enough to keep the trade going. When you bring that to the ngos, going, "why are you supporting so-called sustainable fisheries," what is their response? I don't want to talk about this on camera. Well, you don't have to name them by name. But I'm saying, why wouldn't everyone think the way you do? Uh, because the fishing industries have got, you know, pretty long tentacles into the ngo community. Fishermen are not bad people that want to empty the oceans out. They are some of the biggest environmentalists that I know. The first people that told me about climate change, the very first people, fishermen. Man: There's something in this whole notion that the shark fin soup is bad. To completely ban the use of fins in the United States will literally have no effect on the global conservation of sharks. Hofford: Some of the scientists and the ngos that are backing the sustainable shark fin trade act are not really mindful of how big and how powerful the criminals are in this trade because it is a hidden trade, and it only comes to light during seizures. Hofford: The restaurants in Hong Kong are just as much a part of the problem. They have a moral duty to stop selling shark fin. And that's why we want them to see sharks within the concept of crime. Roth: What's so notorious about it? Stokes: There's the retail market, mom and pops going in and buying the odd little bit here and there. And then there's the wholesale, where they're coming in and they buy sacks. When it comes down to the money, which is what's driving it all, we're looking at $380 million just in the fin trade alone, with over a billion dollars worldwide in all the shark industries. But one of the problems is the statistics. What's being declared is all we know. How much isn't being declared is just mind-blowing. We're just gonna go in as curious tourists and have a look. Just be prepared to be told to get out. All right. We have to fake like we're shopping. What are those? Want to go in, have a look? Yeah, sure. Cat loves the sharks.Which is all right. Those are pectoral fins. Sea horses. Roth: That looks like coconut. Man: Get out! Get out! Yeah. Stokes: Ok, ok, you don't have to push. No push. Roth: Fish caught in 1987?Stokes: 1987. What is that? Stokes: Can I take photo? Woman: No, no, no.Just one. Just one. No, no, no. No, no, no. Is that a whale--oh, I was saying, what is that? [Speaks Chinese] Ow! Don't do that. That's not nice. Don't get run over by a tram. Oh, yeah, I'll try not to. Stokes: Obviously you're trying to hide something for your business. No, none. Done. Stokes: That is whale shark.It's done. Why are you closing? Why we cannot see? Why not? [Speaking Chinese] Anyone would think they had something to hide. Cool. Yeah. Stokes: I don't know this one, I don't think. Roth: Wow. The smell is strong. They look like candies. Hello. Hi. What are these? Does he know what that-- the big one came from? Man: Jaws.Roth: Jaws? Oh, that's from a great white. Oh. That's a great white shark fin. These are all fin, right? Man: Yeah. Wow. This is the closest I've ever gotten to a great white shark. It's here. It is not for sale. It is displayed, because, as our friend told us, great whites are illegal. But it is completely untraceable. People with permits or not brought them in. Stokes: Do you know what type of shark, or? Tiger shark. And how much is it? 13-- some are hammerhead, some are tiger. So what is that one? Oh. These are the small hammerheads and big hammerheads. Stokes: Blue shark?Blue shark? What are these? This is like, uh, a kind of blue shark. Blue shark. And this is also blue shark? Yeah, blue shark.Stokes: They're all blue. They're all blue.Blue shark. Roth: Ok, what just happened? So what happened was, that second guy said, no, no, no, these are blue. These are blue. Blue shark's not protected. And that's why he changed the narrative, he heard us talking about hammerhead. Yeah. Who called him? Who told him? Who tipped him off we were in there? You've got a western film crew in one of these shops, they're all looking in through the doorway. The second guy has seen me a lot. Is he now gonna call every other one of his trader friends and say, "these guys are coming?" That already happened. When we were in there filming with the first guy, that guy got called. That's why he came in. He's actually with the shark fin association. He's trying to get their side of the story over, which is why I played along a little bit with him and tried-- well, should we try and talk to those guys? Why not? Man: He just called back. They can talk now. Can we do that? Yes. Yes. Yes, let's go. Yes. Where? Man: Go to ivas hotel. Oh, this could make some good footage. Have you ever talked to these guys? They refuse. This is the first time they're speaking to you? Yeah. Why do you think they're suddenly doing this? They want to get their side of the story over. That's what they want to do. Let's do this. [Indistinct chatter] Thank you. [Speaking Chinese] Is there one misconception about China and the shark industry that he would like people around the world to know? [Speaking Chinese] [Speaking Chinese] What you're saying is, we're just using the fin, but the sharks are still in danger. Right? So forget the demand for shark fin. Are all the other market, the meat, the cartilage, the liver oil, do you think that shark's population will still continue going down if we remove the shark fin element? If we stop the soup, are the sharks still going to get killed? Roth: I don't know if i'm drinking the kool-aid, but I listened to those guys, and everything they said was perfectly reasonable. This is actually something that I've been hearing, and we've all been hearing for a long time. We need to look at all of the products, not just shark fin. So long as everything else is still carrying on as normal, what they're saying is 100% true. They are just using and utilizing the off-cut, technically. Even though we know the shark fin's the driving force. Finning, as it was known, which is the practice of chopping off a fin at sea and throwing the carcass overboard, literally still alive. That was on the long line tuna boats, because they didn't want to fill the hold with a big carcass of little value. They knew that the regulations would come in when people started seeing the barbaric images. They were already one step ahead, which was why the marketeers of the shark fin industry went around and started really peddling those other industries, to give value so that the fishermen would actually land the whole shark. Now the whole shark had value. Roth: Wow. It's a big problem. Worm: Banning shark finning was an important step in reducing mortality of sharks and eliminating the cruel and wasteful practice of cutting off the shark's fins and then discarding the bodies. What we found, though, is that this hasn't eliminated the total mortality of sharks. [Indistinct chatter] Now they're sold for their meat, for their liver oil, which also goes into cosmetics and food supplements, for their shark cartilage, which goes into health products. "Sharks don't get cancer." That's the title of a controversial book by Dr. William Lane who holds a phd in biochemistry. Bill Lane believes there's something in the cartilage of a shark that stops cancer tumors from growing. Woman: Shark cartilage got first promoted as an anti-cancer therapy, and then it kind of exploded because it was profitable. It created a mythology that said that sharks don't get cancer. That really is a just a myth that's propagated by folks that are interested in making the shark products. Did you know that sharks don't get cancer? Sharks don't get cancer. Merly: We know from many cases that have been documented of sharks both in captivity and in the wild showing that they had in fact developed tumors. It's sold as a dietary supplement. People that are building muscle are told that it can help them protect their joints. We tested it on human cells, and those human cells actually responded by producing inflammatory mediators, things that would be entirely counter indicated, where the underlying pathology is actually inflammation. You can get a lot of cartilage out of a single shark because the entire body of the shark is made out of cartilage. Sharks have really large livers. You're gonna get an enormous amount of that oil from a single shark. So they'll land that shark even though it's not what they were going after because they can make some money off of that shark, whether that's liver oil or cartilage, meat, or fins. They're incentivizing retaining those sharks. This is a big issue because it's problematic to consume large amounts of these animals. Hammerschlag: The argument for sustainable shark fishing is that people get to eat the meat and get nutrition from it. The problem with those arguments is our science is showing that shark meat and shark fins are not healthy. Samples taken of shark meat shows that they have very high levels of Mercury. That's a neurotoxin to humans that can result in reproductive failure or in an extreme level, death. The fins of sharks actually contain neurotoxins that are linked with the development of Alzheimer's in humans. The high levels of Mercury is not coming naturally. Most of the Mercury is coming from coal fire burning plants. They're putting the Mercury into the atmosphere, it's settling in the ocean. Bacteria take that inorganic form of Mercury, they convert it to an organic form, and then small organisms eat that bacteria, and it gets more concentrated and starts working its way up the food web to the sharks, and then we eat sharks, and that's how we get Mercury. And there's nobody testing this? There's no--there's no, like, labels or warning--warning, this contains-- there's nothing? No. But the thing is, shark parts sometimes get mislabeled. They're called other things. A lot of the meat in the U.S. gets sent to places like Europe and Canada and called fish and chips, and it gets fried up. Fish and chips in Canada? Or--and in Europe. Nobody knows this. Nobody's talking about it. If you don't care about sharks, what about the humans that are eating them? Most sharks can't sustain any level of reasonable commercial fishing because they have such a low reproductive output. People who consume shark parts like meat and fins are at a health risk. Building a business based on commercial shark fishing is like betting on a horse that you know is gonna lose the race. One of the things that really does sort of, you know, it gets me up a bit, is everybody does blame China. The demand for fins is China. But it's not the Chinese that are necessarily killing all the sharks. It's happening everywhere. Most people don't realize that. Spain and Indonesia flip and change the number one spot each year, but the interesting thing is, the U.S. is about the seventh biggest exporter of fins to Hong Kong. In the U.S. we're killing sharks and sending them here? Absolutely. What is it gonna take to stop it? We need to target the illegal fishing first. Yeah. There are so many other fishing boats out there that are just ghost ships. They're operating under the radar. These guys are going into people's countries, they're fishing illegally, and running out. So they are raping and pillaging. I want to get on one of those industrial boats. How difficult is that?Uh, very. Most of these fishing boats, they're going out on the high seas, these huge, big industrial fishing boats. They're crewed by basically third world slaves. Some of these boats are going out there, and they're staying out on the sea for years on end. And that's where the illegality really rolls into a human impact. I mean, we are talking human slavery at sea. One, I don't think you'd be very welcome in the first place. Two, safety. You know, fisheries inspectors that have been placed on these vessels, they've met with accidents and just disappeared. We had one famous case just off the west coast of South America. And it was a U.S. inspector. Disappeared. Nobody knows where he went. And the boat didn't get busted, nothing happened to them? Accidents happen at sea. There's an accident or he had a heart attack. And, well, where's the body? Well-- he fell over--fell overboard. This is a huge business, and when you start meddling with it, accidents happen. I want to get on one of those boats. Two pieces of dried bonefish will cost you almost $3.00 or $2.00. Most of our tunas and all the best fish in the world is taken to Europe. They make millions of dollars. The country's not benefiting from any of that. We're not. They're stealing from Liberia and taking your best resource, and the people of Liberia are the ones suffering while Europeans are getting wealthy from it. Roth: A lot of people around the world don't know about illegal fishing and the decimation of the shark population, unless you're living in a country like Liberia where it's directly affecting you. Hi. Man: Hi. Eli.welcome aboard. It's very nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Thank you for having us. Roth: So tell me about this boat. Man: Built in 1951. It was built as a whaling boat. And then we acquired it thanks to the generosity of Mr. Bob barker, who bought the vessel for us. Welcome to "the price is right." Hammarstedt: Bob barker's a big philanthropist. He's a person who has been very supportive of animal causes. Have your pets spayed or neutered. Good-bye, everybody. Hammarstedt: Mr. Barker likes results. Sea Shepherd is a results-driven organization. We measure our success by the number of criminal operations we shut down. We sail into harm's way. We do what no other organization does. The high seas are kind of the last frontier. It's still the wild west out there. It's largely unregulated. And for unscrupulous operators, there's a lot of opportunity to get away with very serious crime. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing is a focus for sea Shepherd because overfishing is such a massive problem. Hammarstedt: We're losing sharks very rapidly. We're absolutely critical. And if you take sharks out of the equation, it affects everything below. And that's why we are running out of time very, very quickly. Hammarstedt: About 4 years ago, this vessel found the most notorious poaching vessel in the world, a ship called "the thunder." Good afternoon, "thunder." This is "Bob barker." You are fishing illegally. Hammarstedt: Chased it across 3 oceans. 10,000 miles. Hammarstedt: They're abandoning ship right now. Say we're standing by to assist in any way. We're putting a boat in the water to recover them. Man: It's going down. Hammarstedt: I believe that the ship was intentionally sunk to destroy evidence of illegal fishing. We try to see where there are areas of need where we stand our ground and use our resources to help countries fight back against poachers who have plundered those places for way too long. That's why we're in Liberia, because it's organized criminal syndicates that are profiting from this. [Indistinct chatter] Roth: So you represent the cooperative of the union of fishermen. Yeah. What was it like before?Like before... At one point your canoe was hit by one of these boats? Yeah. You were in your boat, like a canoe like that? Huge boat just comes right in front. Yeah, yeah. Wow. So you know which company did it, or which company-- [indistinct] What happened to them? Nothing? And they would just run into your boat. Just run into your boat. And would you try and talk to them? Oh, yes. So the vessels, you guys get close up there, and they're burning you. Are there sharks in the water here? And now there's just nothing. And what about today, when they're getting catches? And now it's just small. How long do they think to regrow? But it's all been wiped out now. Wow. Hammarstedt: When the trawlers steal from Liberia, they're stealing from people in a place like robertsport. You've got wealthy fishing boats from some of the wealthiest parts of the world stealing from people in some of the poorest parts of the world. Roth: Tell me about the "labiko 2." The "labiko 2" is a notorious poacher. It's on 3 international blacklists. It was part of a fleet of about 50 ships that absolutely plundered the north Atlantic. In just a matter of years, the deep-sea shark populations there fell to about 10%. The fishing vessels then went to India, wiped out the deep-sea sharks there, went to east Africa, did the same thing there. And then since then nobody's seen these boats. They disappeared. Until we assisted the Liberian coast guard to arrest the "labiko 2." Roth: The coast guard are going on first. They're gonna secure the boat. They've had some very hostile fishermen. [Indistinct chatter on ship] Are they screaming at the coast guard? Medan: I don't want you by yourself, though. Roth: Wow. So this is it. Fucking hell. So take me through how this works. The net would come up here. They take the fins of these deep-sea sharks. The livers would be put into this big tank. The liver of a shark is like 42% of its body weight. Roth: They throw the livers in there, but where's it processed? It actually just kind of melts inside this tank. And then it's run through a system of lines down into a holding tank that's below deck. The lines come down here, and this is where the shark liver oil is discharged. In a 15- to 18-day trip, they would produce about 50 tons of shark liver oil. Translates to 66,000 dead sharks. This is--one of the most vulnerable shark species in the world is being wiped out for is this bucket of oil that you're holding in your hand. And what shark is this mainly? It's predominantly leaf scale gulper shark, which is one of the most vulnerable sharks. They're one of the oldest living sharks. They live till they're about 70. They're very late to reach sexual maturity, and that makes them very vulnerable to overfishing. Roth: So this hole gets filled with shark liver oil. That's overflowing. You read on these websites that are like, we're clean, traceable, eco-friendly, sustainable. And you come down here, and it's literally a dungeon where they're being ground into oil, thrown in the basement, and then people rub it in their face. Is this common on a lot of boats to have a plant like this with the tanks? Nobody knows. And that's because people haven't really known what to look for. A ship like this produces shark liver oil that's used in omega-3 capsules. It produces shark liver oil that's used in cosmetics, face creams, moisturizers. By buying these products, you're contributing to labor situations where you've got guys from very vulnerable countries economically who are being paid $150 a month, they're usually indentured to crewing agencies that keep a lot of that money. They have to fulfill their contract or else they lose everything. Hammarstedt: The living conditions have been abhorrent. It looks like a refugee camp. The officers who are from European countries or who are from China, they live in air-conditioned indoor accommodation. The crew who are predominantly from African countries sleep out on deck in makeshift tents. A boat like this, had it not been boarded by the Liberian coast guard assisted by us, it would have gone on killing sharks for shark liver oil into all perpetuity until the sharks here were completely wiped out. How is this allowed? Nobody really had eyes on the ships. The ships weren't really reporting back. They operate under shrouds of secrecy. Where are the sharks now on this boat? There's shark meat in the ship's freezers. [Indistinct chatter] Gah. Fuck. Medan: It's way below zero. Yeah, let's go fast. So this is the storage. Roth: Shit. Holy shit. Dead hammerheads. You see they are finned also? Look at all this. They were harvesting about 1,500 of these a day. [Grunts] Fucking shit. Medan: There's no reasoning for this shit. Not for medicine, not for nothing. For nonsense. For people to rub in their face. [Indistinct chatter] Fucking hell. If it's getting dangerous up there, let's get the fuck out of here. Wow. That was some shit. Never seen anything like that. Hammarstedt: Vessels like the "labiko 2" are owned by European interests. So that they don't have to abide by European law, they flag to a third party. So that's why the "labiko 2" is a ship flagged to Liberia, owned by a company in Senegal. But the documents seized on board show that the real ownership is in the north of Spain to the region of galicia, which is a hotbed of illegal fishing activity. So does the e.U. Know this? Do they go after them? The e.U. Subsidizes these vessels. A tremendous amount of e.U. Money goes to European flagged ships fishing overseas. The European Union that's writing the laws protecting the sharks are also giving money to the ships that are stealing the sharks? They subsidize fuel, they subsidize new builds, uh, constructions of new ships, and they subsidize the licensing fees, because without the subsidies, it just couldn't go on at all. Is anyone fighting this? Has anyone pointed out this conflict of interest? There are groups that are working to point it out, but the powers behind it are so great. This is fucking crazy. Man: Sharks don't deliberately eat people. When we bring in these great species and we show them to you, we are demystifying them. We are showing you that they are great animals. And that's what this tournament represents. Phillips: The scientists are going to cut the shark open. That's what we do in new bedford. And so if this is bothersome to some, don't watch. These things are beautiful creatures. We gotta make sure that generations and generations of people can enjoy the generations and generations of these great pelagic species. Woman: When we come to the tournaments, we're basically here to sample fish. It gives us samples from larger fish that we normally wouldn't see. And while we're trying as a scientific community to get a lot of nonlethal techniques for doing these studies, we're not getting the data. So in a lot of cases, for our studies to be accomplished, we have to have dead animals. You want to put that in a bag? We do a dissection internally to look for reproductive condition. We take the stomach contents so we know what they're eating. 69 for right. Phillips: She's measuring the gonads. No, I'm not. This isn't a gonad. Phillips: Another big word. This is gonna happen with us or without us, and we feel we might as well take advantage of the samples. Phillips: Now remember, this is a competition, so we're weighing it a third time. Wait till you see this. Wait till you see this shark. Wait till-- you're gonna love it. Winner winner, chicken dinner. Fish for dinner. Natanson: Boy, that's skinny. No, no. Phillips: Remember we talked about the circle hooks. See that? See how it's a circle? That always ends up in the mouth. Doesn't end up in the belly. Natanson: There's something wrong with this fish. Did you see the color of it? I think there is or was a foreign body in here. See? See that hole right there? It might have come through there. Oh, here we go. Ok. Found it. What did you find? A hook. See this hook? Right here. Roth: So do you think that's the source of the infection? Yeah. It's only offset at that side. Roth: What kind of hook is it? It's a circle hook, which is-- which is a legal hook. Any way you can get a kid exposed to sharks, it's a little bit of them that's actually participating in nature. I think of the impact that that made. You look at the teeth here, you can see all the rows of teeth. He's dead. Phillips: These kids touched sharks that they've never even heard about and that most people in the world will never see. And they've actually touched it. Roth: They're saying, oh, it's great because these kids will never get close to a shark. Now they can get close to a shark. But is this really how you want them getting close? Parading around these dead, bloody animals to kids and handing out shark teeth for trivia, it's fucking nuts. Phillips: That is awesome. That's a beautiful fish. [Applause] Look at that. It's a beautiful organism. 337! We have a new first place. Give them a hand! [Applause] Roth: This is something that goes on up and down the entire east coast, and to me it's barbaric and insane. These weren't starving fishermen. These are doctors, lawyers, businessmen that are doing this for fun. They're doing this for bragging rights on their Facebook page. Roth: Hacking up dead sharks with saws and machetes and talking about how it's for science and conservation. We're processing the fish, like we do in new bedford. This is what we do here. This is--it's a commercial fishing port. We're not finning the fish. We're just processing. Roth: No, I want people-- people are gonna know, it's going to fertilizer. Phillips: Finning is horrific. You have a live fish, you cut their fins off, and you throw the rest of the fish away. And I'm pretty sure that some of the fish that they're finning, some of the sharks they're finning, you don't really eat anything on the shark except the fin. Woman: In 2011, The Bahamas officially became a shark sanctuary. About 10% of our marine environment is currently protected, and that's about 12.5 million acres. When we decided to pass the shark sanctuary act, it was just a matter of simply amending our fisheries regulation, because there was nothing in it at the time that addressed sharks. Tell me about the benefit of protecting sharks, what it did for your economy, what it did for tourism here. People started coming here specifically to do shark-related activities. So we've actually seen a little over, in 20 years, about $800 million generated through shark-related tourism, which is great. You know, one reef shark over its lifetime can be worth about $250,000, just on that one reef alive. That's how popular it is to come here. So our reef sharks are very valuable. So. We tend to like them alive more than not. More than dead. Roth: How long have you been taking people shark diving? Over 10 years now. How many dives roughly? Thousands. Thousands. Has a shark ever attacked a customer? No. No, a shark has never gone and intentionally tried to get someone. They don't hold vendettas. They don't get angry. Has anyone lost a limb or an arm or anything crazy like that? Not in shark diving, no. Not that I know of, no. But it's just one of those animals, man. So much tolerance for us. No tolerance for them. Nothing. It's crazy. Romeiro: 10 years ago, people thought this was nuts. Well, the truth is, sharks are not really going after us, and we've been able to keep people safe. Roth, narrating: Being under water after all that death felt like a celebration of life. I was so happy that they were alive. And I just kept thinking, "don't leave The Bahamas, please stay here. You're protected here." Roth: How difficult is it to protect what is protected? Bahamians are very on board for marine protection. The one concern that usually comes up is that they don't want their livelihoods affected. We had to kind of explain to them, it's all about ensuring that the fisheries you have are being managed sustainably so that you do have them for years to come. I think the number-one thing that really connected with the people was the education and awareness about why sharks are important and why finning and fishing for sharks is not a good idea. You understand that what they're doing for the ocean and for us ultimately is actually really good. I just feel like everyone in the world should look at this model and imitate it. For sure. Roth, narrating: On this journey, I got to meet a number of amazing activists, people fighting hard to protect sharks. Woman: Myself and my team of marine biologists, we go out to collect data on shark behavior, and we bring the general public along with us and then dive in without a cage and meet sharks eye to eye to see just how incredible they really are. Sharks swim past surfers, swimmers, and divers all day every day, and it's so rare that they ever make a mistaken identity bite. And it's really a unique thing because there's not too many predators that you can just kind of cruise along with. Man: My goal was to undo what "jaws" did and show the personalities of these sharks. So I had a company that makes all the movie posters make me this 6-foot, 4x4 smiling shark, not teeth, and me and a couple other people went all over the world and we put 'em up. People would be driving and sort of like, "what is that?" Until I got arrested. For doing it. Muller: I do a lot of work with children's hospitals. These kids that are in bed that are never gonna see the ocean, and they're in so much pain. When you put the vr goggles on them, it hacks their brain. They're not only out of pain, they're experiencing something that they're never, ever gonna get the opportunity to experience. Worm: We know that this environment is very rapidly changing due to change in climate. So we wan to keep on top of what the sharks are doing, and we do that by tagging them with a small pinger. And then we close it up and the shark goes back in. It gives us signals every couple seconds, and we can find out about their movements. Roth, narrating: Thanks to advanced technology, conservation ngos are innovating new ways to protect our oceans and marine life from the threats of illegal fishing. Oceana and the Leonardo DiCaprio foundation have partnered with Google and skytruth to launch global fishing watch, a free app that uses advanced satellite technology and data collection to track commercial fishing boats all over the globe. Pirate fishing vessels will now have a tougher time hiding in the shadows, thanks to these high-tech conservation efforts. And local governments across the globe will be able to use this resource to fight back against illegal fishing and cultivate healthy, abundant oceans. These efforts are just starting to pay off. Woman: When the buying stops... Crowd: When the buying stops. Woman: The killing will, too. Roth, narrating: People all over the world are joining the fight. Crowd: Rights. Rights for great whites. Leave the sharks alone. Roth, narrating: But it's not enough. So much more needs to be done. Because sharks are being killed at an unsustainable rate. Stokes: An ocean without sharks is a very, very scary thought. Once you remove all those sharks, everything else will go into anarchy. Roth, narrating: Since you started watching this film, an estimated 30,000 sharks have been killed. But this is not over. The fight has just begun. Roth, narrating: There's no one villain or solution. Everyone has to recognize their part in the problem and work together to change the behavior before it's too late. Imagine this ocean without sharks. What would it be? How's the diving here?Amazing. Stokes: February 3, 2020, Hong Kong. We're in the height of the coronavirus. The shark fin traders are drying shark fins on the streets for everybody to cough, sneeze, and do whatever else on it. Unbelievable. Roth: Have you been threatened by any of the mafia triads, organized crime? No, I've just had some funny phone calls, you know. But, you know, whatever, who cares. They're just losers. Not scared of them. Hofford: Maxim's, stop shark fin! Crowd: Maxim's, stop shark fin! When the buying stops, the killing will, too. Roth: One thing that struck me about the "Bob barker," I felt old. No, really fucking old. I mean, these kids are like, 18, 20, 22, 24. I feel very under-tattooed. I feel like that's one of the qualifications.
