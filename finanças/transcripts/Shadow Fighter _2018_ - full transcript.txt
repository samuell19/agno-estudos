Subtitles by explosiveskull No luck? Boss? No. Nothing. Hey, where you at? Just looking. Just looking? Yeah, just looking. Reg, if you ever need to talk, I'm here for you. Talk about what? Oprah? What? You want to talk about Oprah, we can talk about Oprah. You know, Reg. There ain't nothing to talk about. Don't go giving me attitude, Reginald. - Reginald? - Yeah. - What's that? You're my mama now. - Your mama? You're going to scold me? Huh? - You don't look anything like my mama. - I'm sure of that. You need to go. - Go. - Reg... Mariah, go! Go, okay. What's going on, tough guy? Mmm-hmm. That yours? 'Cause I'd like a little of that. Hey, if she's yours, I got you, bro. I'll even help you out. Break you off a little something, make her lay down for her man, if you know what I mean? Hey, If not, that's sweet, is all I'm saying, bro. Cause you know I got a sweet tooth, ain't that right, Brick? Hey, where you going? Reggie, what you been up to, man? Where you been at? - School. - School? What, you play ball now? Yeah, I ain't think he was a baller. So why you do it, dawg? Why you buy into all this school shit? How old are you now? - Sixteen. - Sixteen. - Where your ride at? - Don't have one. That's right. Cause you're in school all the damn time. You see that? You ain't going to get that playing their game, dawg. No, what you going to get is a bunch of nickels and dimes and cheap ass talk about success. But, nickels and dimes they don't get you the ride. They don't get you the girl. And it damned sure, ain't get you this. See this right here, baby? This is what it's all about, dawg. This is where you live, dawg. But you're smart, Reggie. You get started and you will be flushed overnight. I guarantee it. - I'm good, all right? - Reggie. Reggie, Reggie, Reggie. What's up? Why you being so cold? Oh! I know what this is about. Your brother. Look, man, I loved Chill Will too, but he wasn't as smart as you. And that's why that happened. He made the big mistake, right? He stopped selling and he started using. But, you're smarter than that, kid. You're smart enough to make this money and stay clean. Money to buy your little bit of sweet some pretty clothes. - Money to put your mom in a new... - I'm good, all right? Hey, where you going? I really don't think you hear me. This is it right here, bro. This is what it's all about. Matter of fact, watch this. Yo! Wanna make a dollar? Yeah, come over here and make you some money, dawg. Come on, man. Move. Come on, dawg. Watch this, bro. Hop on one leg. You see what I'm talking about? Yeah, there you go. You earned it. - Better calm that down. - Calm down. Ooh, bueno. Come make this money, dawg. Come over here and kiss my ass. Come on, man. - Watch this. - Get out of here. When you got money, people do for you. When you don't, you do for them. So who you want to be, Reggie, huh? Who you want to be? - Look, man, I told my mom... - Your mama? - Yo, you hear this guy? - Your mom... Will always told me that you was a mama's boy. And that's probably the only smart thing that dead fool ever said. Because your mom ain't nothing but a... Hit that boy. You don't talk about a boy's mama, man. Gun. Let's go. Go! So, I blew him off and I told him that I would let him know. Because I want you to come too. It's a cop thing and all. Me? Oh, no. I don't think so, Viv. It's not a double date or anything. No. I want to hang around Reg. Reg is a big boy. Are you sure he wants to spend his Friday night with Mama? I know. I know, Viv, but... What is it with you and this whole cop thing now? Well, I have dated everyone at Children and Youth, - and it's time to give... - True. ...law enforcement a try. Starting with Vice. Seriously, Joce, you should come out. I mean, who is going to tell me to keep my panties on, if you are not there? You mean, help you find them at closing. - Oi... - Seriously. You need to get out. I told Reg we'd go out to a movie. He's not going to be watching movies with mama forever. And besides, I told you I see him with the, uh... The King girl, Mariah. The girl with the woman's body. - Whoo! - I'm sure Reg doesn't notice. He's a teenage boy, honey. He sees it. And he wants it. Hell, I want it. If I had a tight little booty like that, I wouldn't need to just throw myself at the Vice. They... They would come looking for me. Viv, it's like I told you, Reggie's still adrift. Ever since his brother died, he's just going through the motions. I know, hon. Just try to take a step back for a minute, and take yourself out of the picture, I mean, we've seen this a million times - at Children and Youth, right? - Yes. And what do we tell the clients? Vivian... Well, what do we tell the clients? You have to think of yourself too. You have to show them that life goes on. I know, Viv. It's just different when it's your home that's suffering. Wait, stop. Go away. No. Stop. - Wait. - Go away, kid. Don't follow me. - Just leave me alone. - Look, I just... I just want to thank you. Yeah, well, don't. Just forget it. Forget you ever saw me. What? You... You forgot your... Oh, wait. Wait. Here. Here. Here. This... This is yours. Okay. Pick and Brick, they might have killed me. Uh, thanks. Take it. Okay. They might've killed you too. Yeah, thanks for the money. Uh, why'd you do it? Mister? You know you don't have to live here, right? You shouldn't live like this. My mom, she could help you. Go home to her. - I just want to talk to you. - No. - I... I just want to... - Go away! Just... Go take care of her. Learn to fight, kid. Reggie! In the bathroom, Ma. Dinner's ready in five minutes. Okay. Mariah! No, no, no! It's good. I'm cool. No... Nothing happened. No, he just gave me the usual rap, you know, the world according to Zeke and blah. Uh. Tonight? I... I don't think so. Yeah, maybe tomorrow. All right. Talk later. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. - Reggie, come on, honey. - I'm coming, Ma. Hey! Ooh! Hey! Patience. Patience. How was work? Great. Long though. Great, but, long. Can you grab me that pitcher from the top shelf? I'll make us some tea. Reggie, what happened? - Huh? What? - What's wrong? Oh, uh, nothing, I pulled a muscle in gym class. A muscle? Yeah, it's a muscle, Mom. Leave the pitcher. Come here. Let's talk. I want to hear all about it. Let me make sure I got this right. You were fighting with a homeless man. No. No, no, no. He was fighting Pick and Brick. Zeke and Theo? Oh, my God. - Pero what? - Mom. Mom. It's okay. What part of this is okay, Reggie? Okay. You don't understand. All right, they were hassling me. And this homeless guy... This homeless guy, he just... He just lost it, Mom. Reg, what have I told you? To stay away. You promised me. Mom, they stopped me. Okay? And they were hassling me. And this homeless guy, Zeke, was hassling him, and the next thing I know, he was standing up to Brick and then... The homeless guy? Mom, he was... He was unbelievable. Man, he was like... He was like a boxer or something. I mean... Bam! Bam! And the big dummy was on the ground and... Really? A homeless guy did all this? Who is he? I don't know. He was just some guy walking by. And what happened? Reggie. Zeke. He hit you. He was talking about Will and you. - And? - And I tried to hit him. What have I told you? It doesn't matter what he says, you don't do anything, you don't say anything. - You just walk away. - They do not let you walk away. Reggie... Please. I can't lose you too. Sorry, Mom. When he starts talking about Will, I mean, like he had nothing to do with that... I just get so mad. I know. We just can't let that anger poison our lives. I guess, we should give thanks to the stranger too. Mom, you should have seen him. Well, he could be dangerous too. - No doubt. - I want you to stay away from him. What do you mean? He helped me. This time, Reggie, but, so many of those people are unstable. And if he's as talented as you say he is, - it could be a scary thing. - Mom, he... He wasn't crazy like the rest of them. Want to know what he said right before he beat on Brick? He said, "You don't talk about a man's mother." Maybe so. But, I want you to be careful. And I want you to stay as far away as possible from Zeke and Theo, do you understand? They're going to want payback, Reggie. - And they're not going to care who it is... - Okay, just... Just don't go report him to anyone. Zeke? That's going to make a difference. The homeless guy, Mom. The homeless guy. After what he did, he deserves a medal. Keep that on. Good. Love you, Mom. Hey, uh, have you seen a guy, - this tall, uh... - Oh, kid... A kid. Excuse me, sir? Excuse me, sir, I'm looking for a guy, uh, this tall, rough around the face, he punches, and... You must mean Lightning. Lightning. He's definitely over there. No, he's there. I don't want it! Get away! Uh, excuse me, sir, um, Lightning, have you seen the guy? Hey, uh, miss, uh, I think his name is Lightning. Lightning! He... He lives over there, kid. Over there. Who's there? Who's there? Go away! Leave me alone. Kid, is that you? You need to stay away from me! Leave me alone, please. Leave me alone. How you doing? Oh! Good morning, pancakes! For my hero. What? I know you were sticking up for me and Will yesterday. Oh, Mom. I just want you to know that I understand and appreciate it. Okay? We just have to be careful, if we're going to make it. Right? Right? Oh, yeah. Uh, right. Right. Make it. There's your syrup. I'm going grocery shopping, honey. Do you want anything? Uh, no... No thanks. Okay. Enjoy. See you in a bit. Bye. Hey, I... I just wanted to thank you. Properly. My mom, she made, uh, some pancakes for me. She said I was a hero, you know, for sticking up for her and Will. But, dude, you're the hero. You're the one who deserves this. What do you want, kid? Nothing. Then, go. You thanked me, you gave me my medal, get going. Your name's Lightning, right? Right? The pancakes were good. Kid I don't live in your world. My world's pretty ugly and I can get ugly. Now get the hell out of here. Who are you? What are you doing here? You must've been someone. A boxer? A boxer, right? I mean, is that what you did? I mean, the way you... You laid into Brick. You were up and down that big bully like... Like he was your punching bag. Big ones are easy. They think they just have to show up. It's... It's what? Sneaky, mean ones, the ones that'll do anything... You can see it in their eyes. Like... Like Pick? What do you want, kid? Leave me alone. Wait! Wait! Yesterday you said something. You said, "Learn to fight." How am I going to do that? Who's going to teach... I don't have anyone! Yeah, street punks, you know, they're all the same. They just got a few moves and lots of attitude. What are you doing? I'm just trying to thank you. Huh? Want to thank me? Thank this? Over here. Watch the footwork. Yeah, it's the footwork, huh? That's right. Keep your feet under you. Now it's your turn. A guy rushes you. Kid, you don't back straight up. What you got to do is give him an angle. Step to the side and pivot. See? Step to the side and roll under. Then, only then, you strike. See? Wait for it. Sooner or later, every big guy is going to rush you. And it's your turn. Then, it's your turn. - Go? - Go. Come on, kid. Come on, kid. I'm coming to get you. I'm coming to get you. Okay. I'm okay. Let's go. Come on, kid. Yeah, attaboy. Come on. That's it. Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. Come on. Kid. Not bad. Why are you doing this, kid? I got to... I got to learn to protect myself. Protect my mom. You know why you didn't hit that punk yesterday? Why? You weren't ready to hit him. Yeah, you were mad. You wanted to hit him. You weren't ready. You weren't in position to strike. See, that's what it's all about. You gotta be in position to strike first. Be where you need to be. What do you mean? So, who you going to watch your movies with now, Mama? Be grateful, she's a smart girl, and she's in school and she isn't some little hoochie-coochie on the street, right? Amen to that. Oh, is that where he's at? Oh, yeah. Soon as we got home from church. Off to work on his project with Mariah. Aye, now don't you worry. He's always going to be your boy. Viv. Have a boy of your own, then tell me not to worry. You know, it's not Mariah or girls, I worry about, I know. It's just growing up here, in this. You know he had a run in with Zeke the other day, after school? Zeke? - He's the one with the, uh... - Yeah, the ice pick. Guess he followed Reg home. He hit him. What? - What for? - You know what he's all about. Getting kids to deal for him. - So, he did what... - You don't think Reg would? My Reg, oh, Lord, no. He would rather cut off his hand than do that. Not after watching his brother go down that road. Right. So why he hit him? Well, Reggie said, he tried to hit Zeke first. He said that he was talking about me and Will. He can't go doing that. He can't always walk away either. He's gotta learn to take care of himself. The Zekes of the world, they ain't going away. I know. And get this. Reggie said, that they were also hassling some guy, some homeless guy, and that the guy, the homeless guy... - ...beat the hell out of Theo, Zeke's big muscle. - Yeah. What? Do you believe that? He said the guy beat him up and down, threw him on the ground. Hit Zeke too and then chased him off. Oh, my God, this is crazy. You joking, right? Well, that was my week. - How was yours? - Mmm. Wait. I didn't ask you about the cop thing. - Mmm... - And? Eh, it's not bad. But, I think the boys in blue were on their best behavior for me. So, you had to keep your panties on. But, they're good guys, and they know how to treat a lady. You know, I think we should double up next time. Mmm. Uh... Maybe. - Sure. - Hmm? A maybe? A... Big changes in the whole household. Big changes. I'm going to hold you to that. Okay, thank you. - Anything you want. - I told you, I see it in the future. This is good. Ah, I'm going to have to go to the gym. Got to move around. Relax. Just punches and punches. Uppercuts and hooks. Bam, bam, bam, bam! That's it. Uppercuts and hooks to the body. Bam! Bam! Just Keep moving. Yeah. Ooh. Keep moving. Keep moving.

It's a right hand, it's power hand. So, you wait after you jab, you jab and then you throw the right. You throw the right! Let me see you do your jab, kid. Jab, jab. Jab.

It's going to be a lot of fun. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Who you going with? Oh, well, now since you asked that, probably Eddie. - Well, he's not that cute, so... - Mmm, okay. And besides, Stacy asked me out. - Really? - Yeah, it was a great proposal. I mean, no one else asked me, so... Oh, come on, that... That's not fair. Ooh, all right, I got to go. - What? - Gotta go. I thought we were supposed to go to the library. That was your plan. You were supposed to help me with it. Reggie! Yo, Lightning. Lightning, yo! Yo, Lightning. Yo, Lightning. Hey, what the hell are you doing? Lightning, yo. Where'd you get all this? What? You? Well, you come around there growling like a bear and stuff. Yeah, well, come on, let's patch this stuff up. Come on. Yo, where'd you get all this stuff? That old gym down on Philbert Street. My old gym. I knew it. So you are from around here. Once upon a time. Well, you got to take me. Please? No. It's been shut down for years. Nothing but rats and garbage. Here, I got this for you. - That's a... - It's all we got, kid. Put it on. Yeah. Your head. Yeah, okay. - Of course, we should wash it first. - Oh, come on. Relax. Hey. Look what I got you. You don't have to put those on your head. Put these on. Real deal boxing mitts. Come on, put them on. Come on, man. You'll never know whose hands were in those. Thanks, man. Keep your hands up. - Oh, you don't want this. - Hands up. - No way. - Jab. Let's see that jab. Come on, kid.

He really shouldn't let a sweet little treat like you walk home by yourself. I just want to talk to you, sweetheart. - Stop it. - Hey! I just want to talk. You know why they call me Pick, baby? Huh? I don't give a damn how sweet you smell, I will pick your ass apart. Nice piece. Don't touch it. - Reggie gave it to... - Shh. Yeah, I got a gift for Reggie. You see to it that Reggie gets his hands on this. Okay? He'll know what to do with it. Shh. Reggie? Reggie! - Mom! - Reggie! - Come on, come on. Come on. - No, who is he? - What's going on? - Mom, this is Lightning. Come on. - No. No! - What happened? Nothing happened. He's hurt. Wait, are you hurt, honey? Mom, stop. I'm okay, all right? There was a fight and he took a knife for me. - We need to get him in. - Reggie, I am not a doctor. Mom, you studied to be a nurse. Okay, you study this kind of thing all the time. I see you practicing your books. Now, help me get him in. - Okay, we'll take him to the hospital. - No. Stay right here. Just wait right here. - No, I told you, no doctors, no hospitals. - Wait, wait, wait. - Stop, stop. Stop. Mom... - Reggie, I can't. Mom, Mom, Mom, this is the guy that helped me. - I can't do it. - Mom, please. This is the guy that helped me. - Remember? - Reggie, I... Just put him in the kitchen. Come on. Lightning, let me help you. Okay? You helped me. Now, let me repay the favor. - Come on. - Just... What's your name? Lightning. Not some street name. Your real name. It's not a street name. It was my... Nevermind. Well? Just call me Lightning. I will not. Everyone has a proper name. What's yours? Rodney. Rhodes. Rodney, I'm Jocelyn Hall. Reggie, can you please give me some towels from the laundry? And get me an old shirt of Will's. - And a T-shirt. - Okay. How does that feel? Wonderful. You made quite an impression on Reggie. Yeah, well, he's a good kid. Thank you. It's not easy. What's that? A mother, to raise a good son. No, sir. It's not. I wish you would see a doctor. So, who's Will? Reggie's brother. So, he's the reason for the bad blood with the punks, huh? That Zeke, sucked him in. Got him into dealing. It wasn't long until Will started using. After that, you know the story, you've been around. I'm sorry. Reggie was devastated. Just about killed him. He still hasn't come to terms with it. - But... - But what? Meeting you has helped. Thanks. Well, I don't want to insult you, but, you stink, you're dirty, so take off your clothes and jump in the shower. Come on. Yeah. Got it. Yeah, I'm home. Reg, where are those towels? Uh, I'm coming, Mom. It's just me. I brought some towels. I'm setting them here. Thank you. Rodney, what are we going to do? We? You just met me, you don't even know me. Yes, but, you're involved now. Not just because of today, but, you've become part of Reggie's life. That's what happens when you make an impression on someone. No. No? You don't want that. You don't want me involved. Mr. Rhodes. We're all in this together, Whether you like it or not. No. Sorry, there no "we." Nothing good can come of that. It never does, when I'm involved. Just... Just let me go and I'll walk away. Everyone will be better off that way. I'm sorry. Come on in, Mariah. What's... What's wrong? What happened? You okay? When I was heading home, Pick, he stopped me. That's where he was. What? No. There was a fight with Brick... Oh, I'm sorry, did he hurt you? Are... Are you okay? - No. I'm... I mean, I'm okay. - You... You sure? He didn't do anything. But, what happened? He gave me this. What? He wanted to make sure I gave them to you. You're supposed to sell them. Reg, this is what you've been doing, isn't it? No. No! No, okay? I hate that stuff. All right, that's not me. Hey, you know me. Okay? Reggie, I'm scared. I'm so sorry. What are we going to do? I don't know. Reggie, what's going on? Mariah, what happened? Sweetie. But why Mariah? He could've just stopped me like he's done before. You would've just said no. This way, you're stuck with it. I guess. I'm sorry, Reggie. He's telling you something. Heh. He gets to the people you love. That's how cowards operate. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Okay? This is between Zeke and me. Just what to do you think you're gonna do? I don't know, all right? But I'm gonna tell him he do this, all right? He doesn't threaten her, or you, or anyone that I care about. All right, this is between us. No, you don't go near him. You'll be playing his game. Don't... Reggie, your mom, she's... She's right, I mean, do you think he's gonna listen to you? Hey, he's trying to draw you in. To engage you on his terms. What have I taught you? What have I taught you? To strike when you're ready. Not when the other guy wants you to. That's right. Well, what are we supposed to do? Go to the police. The cops? No. What, are we supposed to find one, give him the stuff, and tell him our story? Come on, Mom. Reggie, this isn't some schoolyard scuffle, honey. Reggie's right, it won't work. I mean, it's not gonna even get the drugs off the street. You hand them drugs to the wrong cop, he'll hand them right back to Zeke. Yeah, we go to the cops and he'll kill us. You gotta fight. You gotta beat him at his own game. No. No, no. There's not gonna be any fighting. Reggie, I'm not saying we go running into a police station. Okay? But we can't do this alone. It's just not gonna work. Okay? Viv, she knows some cops, some detectives... Aunt Vivian? We can talk to them, off the record. Okay. We can talk to them and tell them what's going on and they can protect us, okay? They can warn him. I don't know. It's something, right? Let me just talk to them. Okay, let me just... Please. Mariah, do you know by when Reggie had to do this? Did he say anything? No. Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Okay? Now you need to go home. It's getting late. Uh, I'll walk you home. Okay? They deserve better than this. We all do. Yeah. I better go, too. You don't have to leave, you know. You can stay on the couch. I can't. What if they come back for you? You don't understand, I can't stay here. There'll always be a place for you here. - If you ever need it. - Yeah, well, thanks, for everything. Be sure to come back so I can check on the cut. Just a scratch. Good night. Good night. WGCG Sports has an exclusive interview with legendary boxing trainer and coach, Paddy Grier. Grier is trainer to boxer Rodney ' "Lightning Rod" Rhodes, who went missing, following the murder of his mother. And is considered a person of interest in that case. Rhodes forfeited Thursday night's World Title match when he failed to appear at preliminary weigh-ins earlier today. I asked Grier about this strange chain of events. Tragic. This is just tragic. Mrs. Rhodes, a wonderful woman, dead like that. And Lightning missing. A talented young man like him, his career just, shattered. It's sad. Rodney is the most dedicated fighter I have ever known. For him to forfeit this fight, something's wrong. Mom? Reggie? Everything okay? Yeah. I mean, Mariah's shaken up is all, but... She's fine. Was she scared? Is that what you've been doing with your time? Training with Rodney? You mean Lightning? Yeah, he's been teaching me to box. You mean fight? Reggie, do you think it's a good idea to be spending all that time with a homeless boxer? Oh, come on, Mom. You talked to him. He's all right. Yes, I did, but... People like Rodney, you don't really know who they are. Okay, I know what you mean, Mom, but Lightning's not like that. I mean, you can tell right? And he likes me. Yes, he does. He likes you. Well, I'm off to bed, Mom. Good night. Good night. Later in the day, Paddy refuted any speculation that Lightning may actually be a suspect in his mother's death. No, absolutely not. Rodney was devoted to that woman. She raised him by herself in some pretty rough circumstances. She did a fine job. She raised a damn good man. There's no easy way for a woman to do that. Rodney and I, we talked a lot about that. Hey, you did really good today. I'm proud of you. Yeah, yeah. Hey, how do you knock out a big guy? - So, you wanna knock out a big guy? - Duh! What you've got to do, is you gotta throw the overhand right. Now, it's not easy. It's not a straight right. It's a looping punch you gotta kinda throw it... Now I know how Paddy felt... - Paddy? - ...not being able to do it. Who's Paddy? My trainer from a long time ago. He got too old, couldn't fight anymore, but, you know, that son of a gun, he could look into the soul of a fighter, find the lion in him and just unleash it. He's the one that made me the fighter I was. Was? You mean, the fighter you are. Yeah, right. So, uh, when's your mom gonna see, uh, the cops? When's she gonna talk to them? Tonight. Off record. Off the record, how? Sort of a double-date thing with her friend Vivian. Reggie, don't expect anything. There's nothing in it for them. I know, but my mom, she's, you know, got a lot of faith in the system. Yeah. She told me about Will. How Zeke sucked him in. Got him dealing. And Will started using. And after that, that was it. It was all over. Reg... Reggie, that feeling, hold on to it. - That was good. - Well, good night, I had a good time. Viv, bye. - Wait, let me walk you to the door. - No, it's okay. Thank you. Whoa. I have been waiting to get you alone. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Mmm-hmm. Listen, uh, I wanna talk to you about your problem. Can, uh, we go inside? Sure. Nice house. Look, uh, I know what your problem is. And I feel for you. I really do. I think I could help. You said without evidence there was nothing you can do. Martel said that. Me, I get it. I know about your son and all. I know your whole story. You just want a little payback. I never said that. No, no, of course not. But, look, uh, if you want to play some ball, maybe we could help. I don't play ball. A little quid pro quo. Isn't that what the lawyers say? You do for me, - I'll do for you. - No, no! - Get your hands off. - Get your... Get your hands off me! Get off! Get off me! - Hmm? - Get off me! I'm no whore! No, you're not a whore. Whores are smarter than you. - Here comes your quiet boy now. - Mom, what's going on? Your mother's trying to save your punk ass. But she's too stupid to... - Shut up and get outta here. - Reggie! No, no. - Oh! - Wait. Oh, yeah? What... What happened? - Settle down, Chuck. - What the hell happened? You dropped your left, fat man. Your kid hit me? - You're screwed, kid. - Come on. Just like your brother and every other piece of garbage in this town. You're doomed. You're finished. If the gangbangers don't get you, I will! Are you okay? Mom? No, not these people. Wait right here. I'll be right back. That scumbag hurt you? No, baby, I'm okay. Joce, I am so sorry, I had no idea he was such a... You didn't know. Don't worry about it. I know, but still I... How about this guy, huh? Like he has got some skills. Mr. Rhodes was right. You do have talent. You can take care of yourself. I could take care of you. You okay? He never touched me. Yeah. I can see that. Is he gonna have any trouble because of this? Nah, I don't even think Chuck'll remember but if he does, I'll take care of it. Thank you. Oh, I think it's the least that I can do, right? Where did you learn to fight like that? A friend sort of teaches me what he knows. It's nothing big. Well, he's either a great teacher, or, man, you're a natural, 'cause I think you should start competing, get a real coach. Really? Well, yeah, you're already better than half of those guys at the Police Athletic League. Well, we have other things to think about first. That's right. Yeah, it's a tough one. Without any evidence... You said you destroyed the drugs, right? I did. Well, without that, what do we have? Just someone with a grudge trying to pitch a pretty unlikely story. No offense. We know. All right, well, let me sleep on it, and I'll see what I can come up with. Thank you. Okay. Ready? - Yeah. - Let's go. - Ciao, mijo. - Bye. Bye. Thank you. Anyway, he seems pretty cool. And he said he's gonna see what he can do. You're just saying that cause he liked your boxing. No. Okay, I mean, yeah, but, no, he was cool. I mean, not like the other guy. The other guy was like a bad cop out of a bad movie. Martel, he was cool. Besides, Aunt Vivian likes him, too, so... All right, then, I'll talk to my mom later, call you then? Reg, wait. I wanna be with you. Please. I really wanna see what you do with him. Yeah, but it's kinda one of those... Reg, if it's important to you then it's important to me. - Yeah, but... - Mmm, please? - Come on, Reg. - Ugh, okay, okay. Okay, okay. - But, one condition. - What? If Lightning isn't cool with it, you'll leave. - Okay. - Okay? All right, come on. She just wanted to see what it is we do, if it's okay with you. She's curious, you know? It's okay with you? Uh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Just don't let her be a distraction. What? Huh. Slip to the left, slip to the right. Pow, pow, pow. Come on, let's get out of here. Time to go. We should be good for now. Shh. Mariah, we need to cut through the court. - No, it's scary in there. - Mariah! It's our safest bet, all right? And it's about to rain, come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Yo, yo, yo! Hold on. Where are you guys going so fast, huh? Theo, look, man, I don't have any fight with you, all right? - We're just trying to get home. - Get home? It ain't happening. Pick give you something, something for you to sell. You did that? You got my money? - I don't... - Where's my money? I don't have it, all right. You don't have my money? You don't have money? Reggie, you got two days. Two days before Pick goes mad dog crazy, on your mama. Ah, and your little sweet thing over here. 'Cause you know he likes her. I like her, too. Now, you can forget about your homeless hero because he's done, he's finished. Go. Go! Lightning? Lightning! Yo, Lightning. - Reg, you don't think... - No. All right? Theo couldn't do nothing to Lightning. Not without some help, at least. He's gotta be off somewhere. - This place looks abandoned, - Stop. All right? No, Reg, I'm scared. Come on. Gotta get you home. There's another place I know. Lightning? Lightning? Where have you been? You're late. It's okay, Mom. I'm fine. I was worried. I'm sorry. Mariah called. Did you at least find him? Well, there's more you should know about Lightning. Come inside, I'm gonna show you. Come on. No, no, no! - Reg... - I know, I don't believe it. - Reggie... - Mom, you don't think Lightning did this, do you? No, I don't. I think he's a good man. - But... - But? But what? It does explain things, Reggie. Explain? Explain what, Mom? If you don't think Lightning did this, explain what you mean. The way he lives. What? Reggie, if he thinks he caused this, he lives with tremendous guilt. And if he knows who did it, he may be in trouble. He may have no choice but to run. But it doesn't sound like Lightning. It doesn't make any sense. Reggie, I understand. But something like this can change a person. Forever. It might be why he's gone now. What do you mean? We're thinking about talking to the police, right? Not about Lightning. No, not about Lightning, but we're thinking about bringing them in. Okay. Even if we don't say anything, someone, eventually, one day was gonna say something. And if the police hear something about a homeless boxer, right... So, what do we do? We take care of all this garbage with Zeke. - Mom, what about... - Reggie... - We can't just forget about him. - We won't. But you know he would want you to be safe. Let me see what I can do. I'll go look for him also, okay? You know, he was quite a fighter. Top contender for the middleweight title. - Next in line? - Yep. Next in line. Look at you. "Lightning Rod" Rhodes, the middleweight contender, the best fighter I ever worked with. Paddy? Now, flat on your back like a bum. Now, get up! - The fight ain't over. - No, Paddy. It's over. How many times did I tell you? It don't ever end! You pick yourself up off the mat day after day. It doesn't matter. If the bell rings, it doesn't matter. If they count you out, you gotta get up. - Paddy they killed Ma. - I know, Rod. I know. You didn't see her. You don't know. Those pricks. Those cowards. They beat her and they left her to die. Sweet old woman. But you're still alive, kid. You still got things to do! I can't. I'm done. Look at me. The boy and that woman, they need you. And you need them. I can't. I'll just bring 'em trouble. Get up, Rodney! - No. - Get up! No! Get up, Rodney! No! Rodney? Come on, Rod. I know you're here. I know you can hear me. I just wanted to thank you for bringing my son back. I told how it was when Will died. Reggie was devastated. Lost. Meeting you did something for him. I don't know why that is. I don't understand, why you, of all people, boxing, of all things, would do that, but thank you. He seems so alive and happy. You might have saved us both. Even though I have no idea what's gonna happen. I've got some hope. Reggie told me about this place. Said this is where you trained. I guess this was your world, once upon a time. I wish I would've seen you then. I wish we both knew you then. Rod, I know why you disappeared. I get it. I know the story but I don't believe it. Reggie doesn't either. You've had your problems but you're a good man. Such a good man. But, Rod, you can only run for so long. Someday, you're gonna have to come back and face this. If not, he'll be lost as well. Promise me, you'll come back for Reggie. For us. For me. Promise yourself you'll come back. Be safe, Rodney Rhodes. Well, it's just... This is not part of an official investigation it's just... There's just not a whole lot I can do, I'm just... Tell my captain I have a tip and if someone wants to talk... Are you sure Zeke will be looking for you tomorrow? Um, if not, I can find him. I mean, he practically lives on the street. Yeah, but you can't talk to him on the street. It's gotta be somewhere... Somewhere where I can overhear what's being said. Like an alley? Uh, I know one that might work. I could bring him to it. Nah, that's not gonna work, it's too open. And someone could just come on by. An empty building? That may work. As long as we can get in and out of the place, sure why not. I have the place. Reggie? So where is this old gym? Over on Philbert Street. But you're not going. I should go. No, you shouldn't be getting involed with stuff like this. - I belong with you. - With me. Yes. Will is my brother. Okay. Zeke is my problem and... - What? - And I love you. Okay? I love you. And I got you in trouble once I don't wanna do it again. I love you, too. Please be careful. Nothing's gonna happen Martel will be there. Hey. Martel will be there, okay? Right. Get out of here. When Zeke comes looking for you, you can't run away. Go. Go. Okay, he's here. If anything happens, you call 911 immediately on my phone, okay? - I'm gonna leave it here for you. - Okay. And do not, no matter what, come in. I'm gonna go on in and... And wait for them. Why don't you get in front, help, uh... Help Viv keep an eye out. - Okay. - Okay? Come on, Reggie. Wait here. Don't let anybody in. We need some privacy for this. Reggie? Reggie? Are they coming? They're here. All right, go to your spot, I'll be right here. Go. Is this where you hang with your broke down homie? Where is he? Not here? Too bad. What's all this? You think I was gonna climb in here and settle this with you mano a mano? Oh, we gonna settle it. But not that way. We ain't fighting. My money? I told you, I ain't selling your crap. No? That's your final answer? Okay. So where is it? - Where's the goods? - Gone. - Wrong answer! - Doesn't matter they're still gone. My money, or my drugs, or I'ma put you in the cold, cold ground just like I did your brother. Hold it right there. You set me up. You're dead boy. Dead! Put the gun down. You ain't got nothing on me. No need to have a confrontation, nobody's going to jail, I just wanna talk. Now, put the gun down. Just talk? What you wanna talk about, huh? Put your gun down first. You put yours down first. Okay. Let's do this together. Martel, no. Shit, I ain't gonna shoot no cop. Not with a witness. Martel! See? I'm putting it down. - Did... Did you hear that? - Yeah. Call 9-1-1. Whoo! And now, about that witness. Over here, you worthless piece of... Oh, my God. That's... It's Mariah, what's she... It's not safe, okay? Reggie's in there. Martel is with him, you have to trust him. We have to just hope that he's coming. Wanna play a game, punk? Sure? Here's the first move. Hey, big money, what're you packing, a Saturday night special? Enough to kill you dead, mother... - Lightning... - Just stay still. Where'd you come from? What're you doing? Listen, I'm doing the same thing Paddy would do for me. Whoa! Lightning! Lightning! - Stay down, kid. - Yeah, stay down, kid. Lightning, meet thunder. Aw. Now there's no advantage. You sure about that? Argh! He killed my brother. Bravo. Bravo. I just inherited a business. And I get to kill you both. Heh. Whoa. Martel! Lightning? - Reg... - Lightning, you can't go. I have to go. I can't stay here. - Not now. - Lightning, please. All right, I know what happened, and... And no, all right, no, no. I know. I know that you're an innocent man, a good man. We know you are. It's not that simple. It's... It's not what you think it is. You can clear your name. You gotta understand, it's not that. It's not the cops. It's the people that did it. The people that killed Ma. They'll never let the truth come out. They can't. Too many powerful people, will never let the truth be known, remember that. Yeah, but... But there has to be a way. No, Reg. Hey, you be strong. Kid... You take care of Jocelyn. Let me get this straight, you were on the ground, then what? They were fighting. I knocked the punk's gun down, then Zeke, - he tried to stab him. - Who? Martel? Who was fighting? Hmm? The boy, Reggie. And that punk-ass Zeke. You sure? You know the kid can fight. Get him outta here. What have I taught you? You don't want this. Yeah, keep your hands up. Let's see that jab. Let's see that jab. That old gym down on Philbert Street. My old gym. What's wrong, Reggie? Mariah, you know as well as I do, it should be his name up there, not mine. I know, babe. Whatever it takes, I'm gonna clear his name. I know. Ladies and gentleman, a man that needs no introduction, the middleweight champion of the world, Reggie "the Rocket" Hall.
