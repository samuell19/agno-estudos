[insects chirping] [woman groaning] [tense electronic tones] I thought I had more time. [woman screams] [anxious piano music] It's time. Send the invitations. [anxious classical violin music] [crickets chirping] [anxious classical violin music] I apologize about that, fellas. Very nice to meet you all. Anyways, before we get down to the reason for why we're here, let's just sit back, have a few drinks and get to know each other. The symmetry of this film, the way they composed each shot, the acting, I mean, - I can't believe it. - It's pretty good. Yo, could I? What do you think, you want one? It's been a minute. It was amazing, absolutely amazing. So Logan, let me tell you, your last film was truly an experience. To think that I'm sitting at this dinner table with potentially the greatest filmmaker of our generation. I can attest to that Logan, your last film was, some might call it a religious experience. Fellas, listen. We're just some guys having drinks at a table, that's all. Nick. Quite the performance at the Grammy's a couple months ago, huh? Oh yeah, appreciate that. I'm just more baffled that I'm sitting across from this mastermind right now. Men, listen. I understand this is strange, okay? The reason you're here is 'cause you're some of the most creative and talented people in the world right now, all of you just as successful as the next. The world's in front of each and every one of you. Yeah, I made a good film, great, awesome. I appreciate your love and support but I'm just a guy, truly. And you want to know the difference between us and them? We are the true talent. The unique, the pure. We're not the shallow. So Andrew, any new projects you've been working on? Yeah, actually I'm working on this project right now. It's an adaptation of a book called "The Swerve." Yeah, and the, what is it? - "The Nature of Things," right? - Yeah, that's right. "The Nature of Things." - That's good. - What's the story? It's a hunt for an ancient poem that basically tells the future. It's gonna be an adventure film and we have a big budget this time. I'm pretty excited about that actually. You're with Old Oaks Entertainment, right? Yeah, Old Oaks Entertainment. Any notable castings? We're still in pretty early stages, so no, not yet. [Logan] What about Arthur here? I mean I don't want to put my foot in my mouth or anything but it's a little bit more dramatic than the stuff you're used to. [Logan laughs] Arthur, he says you can't do drama. - That's good, that's good. - That's not it at all. It would be a dream come true to have you. I fuckin' love that. I'm just joking, I'm just joking, wine? Oh, no thanks, I'm good. This meeting's a celebration of success, come on. No seriously, I'm okay. Okay. Flynn, the master artist, what have you been working on? Well, recently I've been working less for myself and more for commission. Not because I need it or anything but I'm becoming more popular. You see, these wealthy people, they're willing to buy my art for a commission price, footing their homes, their apartments or whatever. It's been good to me. Chrone, what about you, big guy, what you been up to? I heard that movie "Nebulous." Yeah, "Nebulous." Great script, a cosmic murder mystery, you watch it? - Yeah, I did. - Really intense. Had my knuckles white the whole film. Not to mention, I think it was your broadest range yet. Thank you, I appreciate that Logan. Yeah but you know, it's good for me now to take some time off. I mean I've been in this business, what? Since I was five years old. So I'll just take some time, focus on myself. That kinda stuff. Godspeed. And my musical friend what of you? I mean I'm on tour, I mean pretty much late in the tour. But I got the phone call about this and I knew it was something I couldn't pass up. So you know, here we are. I think you made the right choice. [soft anxious piano music] [thunder booming] Gentlemen, I gather you here on this glorious occasion because you are some of the world's most up and coming creators right now. An artist, a musician, an actor and a director. I gather you here because I've written my next script and one of you will be chosen to have it and adapt it into any way you so choose as long as you remain true to the text on the page. It is the greatest thing I've ever written. Now there are a few rules. You must stay until Sunday evening and you must have a good time. Sunday evening, I will choose the recipient of the script and that's all. We all go our separate ways. Why wouldn't you make it? Afraid I won't do it justice this time around. My last film drained me, for a lack of better words. I believe in one of you. You expect one of us to make it? Bro, I do music, I don't know how to make a fucking film. It's not about knowing. It's about how you see it, your vision. What's it about? That'll be for the eyes of the chosen one, as you will. Gentlemen, if you don't want to be here, then you can go. There'll be no hard feelings but, but, but if you stay, you might like what you find. Plus, when are you gonna have a weekend this interesting again? Look where you are. You in, Andrew? I'm in. Flynn? I suppose. Arthur? - Nick? - Fuck yeah. [Logan] Good. [film reel rattling] [relaxed piano music] You gotta let us know how you made that film. It was just a beautiful idea that hit me. Sometimes a rose is a rose is a rose, you know? Listen, I'm a music guy but I'm also a movie guy and that shit was the most mind-fucking movie I've ever seen. It was pretty damn good, wasn't it? Damn good. What's playing on the screen here? This is an old film, old experimental film known as "Adoration." It runs about 11 to 12 hours long. It fuels my creativity, I watch it all the time and every time I watch it, it changes or I do. I don't know. Is there a story to it? I've been trying to piece one together for a long time now. I believe it's about a young girl wandering the woods and this young girl has two sides, one side human but one side, something else. Such courage in it. You know, you'd be surprised. I come off as a movie guy but I'm also a music guy. So I've been experimenting with the guitar a bit. I call this one "The Cave." [up tempo rock music] [Nick] Damn, love it, yo. You got that Robert Johnson vibe in there. Yeah? Robert Johnson, huh? Who's Robert Johnson? A man who sold his soul to the Devil at a crossroad in Mississippi. In exchange, the Devil handed him back his guitar, tuned. I got one more for you. [warbling mid tempo guitar music] Beautiful song, right Flynn? Yes. This place is amazing, Logan. You live here year round? Actually it runs in the family. It's where my father used to write. But no, I usually am in my place in New York or my apartment in LA. I'm very fortunate, you see. But I know you guys have all bright futures too. I mean, we're all practically the same age. I was just at the right place at the right time. It's called luck. Luck may have a part of it but nobody's gonna doubt the greatness in that head of yours. I appreciate that, Arthur, I truly do. So, I saw your debut film, very, very well done. Thank you. How were you able to get all the pieces together and make such a good product? Well, I was in my college town and I figured I'd make a movie about depression, existentialism, anxiety. I had my boys there with me, so we did it together and honestly I never expected it to but it blew up. Yeah, I really enjoyed it. Thanks. Truly an accomplishment. If I'm not too bold to say it, you come from the middle of nowhere with no connections in this industry or any others and yet you were found, your voice was heard. Thank you, but it was very unexpected. Very. Flynn, you're a deeply unique artist. Tell me something profound. Well, I guess it's a famous quote. "If you think, you are doomed." That's why I paint. "If you think, you are doomed." That's one way of looking at it of course. Man's greatest enemy is his mind. But I also believe man's greatest ally is his mind. So if you think you are doomed, no, I don't believe that. If you think, you may be free. [Arthur] Cheers to that. [Logan] Cheers to us, men. To our work and our lives. [soft piano music] That was fun, wasn't it? Yeah, it was. I like your friend Lauren a lot. Yeah, she's the best. Where's she from again? California, she cannot stop talking about your movie. Yeah, it was really sweet of her. So, have you spoken to mom recently? No, I haven't gotten around to it but I probably should. You really should, I don't know. She just seems super lonely these days. I know, I've just been so busy, I haven't been able to. Yeah, I get it. Thanks for coming to visit me, you being a big shot now. Shut up, you know I love coming down here. Well, there was also one more thing that I want to talk to you about. Oh yeah? So I kept it a secret for a couple of days now when you were visiting and I want you to be the first to know. [Andrew] What is it? Don't tell me you're pregnant. No, Luke proposed. - No. - Yes. - Oh my god. - Can you believe it? - Congrats. - Thanks. Wow. How'd he do it? - I'll tell you in the car. - Okay. Wow, I'm so happy for you. Yeah, he's really the best guy. Shit. Oh jeez. [Adrianne] You're good to drive, right? Yeah, oh yeah. You didn't drink or anything? I had like one or two, but I'm good. - Are you sure? - Yeah, absolutely. [thunder booming] Andrew, you're so soft-spoken. I've seen you in interviews before and you're so talkative. Yeah, I was probably fucking drunk. I had a bit of a drinking problem on my last film. So, I've toned it down a bit. Cheers to that. I guess it takes courage to admit when you have a problem. Me myself, personally, I never use this to cope with anything going on around me. I use it as a point of celebration amongst friends. It's good. On tour, I probably drink way too much. I mean every city, new night, new liquor. There's not really much I can do about it. It's a terrible habit but you know, it comes with the career, I love doing it and I'm rich, so I guess I'm gone. You enjoy performing? Yeah of course, I mean I love performing. All my best memories. I love our shows. Having random unintelligent rat critics scurry around my work, trying to figure it out. That's why I drink. It was a funny thing. In old Italy, a parallel between alcohol and death. I'm not saying alcohol necessarily causes death, no. But it moves us from a point of clear consciousness closer to death, as if we're on a spectrum. Funny, isn't it? Because when you drink, you feel so much more alive. And I must warn you, I have another guest in the house. He is my doctor. Well, more my mentor. I've been going through a slightly troubled time since my last film and he's helping me through it. He's a bit antisocial, a bit unorthodox but pay him no mind, he means very well. [anxious violin music] What kinda doctor? A psychologist, more or less. Don't be startled when you see him. He's just a bit out there. Out there how? You'll know when you see him. [anxious piano music] [anxious electronic warbling] Good morning, Andrew. Good morning, Logan. You drink coffee? Of course. Well, there's coffee in the kitchen. Grab yourself a cup and then after, meet me outside, I got something to show you, okay? - Sure. - All right. [relaxed guitar music] [anxious metallic piano music] So, you saw my doctor wandering the grounds last night, didn't you? I did, how'd you know? You seem uncomfortable here. The only reason I can see causing that is you witnessing a masked man wander outside your room at night. It's true, why does he wear that mask? He's strange, his methods aren't always approved. Approved, approved how? He uses hypnotism, brings me to a place of peace and clear-mindedness. The mask just calms me, it separates me from his human side. You know it all started right here, what we do, on walls just like these. [Andrew] What's that? Art. No likes, no streams, no dislikes. Just pure. How do you know if it's any good? Funny. Maybe it's the way it should be. Let's go back.

Please shut this off. [tense electronic tones] [anxious deep piano music] Logan, I swear on my life, I saw a body right there. Just floating, motionless. You're telling me you saw a dead body in my pool? Yeah. I mean, I thought I did. I could just be scaring myself. Who was it? I don't know, I couldn't tell. Strange. [Nick] So what's been going on with Flynn? I have no idea. I'm not associating with that schizophrenic, splatter-painting maniac. What? Why? He's a good guy. I don't doubt that but have you not heard the story? [Andrew] What story? All right, look. The man was institutionalized his whole life. He gets out, a year later, his entire home burns down and his whole family dies. They say it was a coincidence. I don't really buy it. Oh my god. That's terrible. You got a cigarette? [Arthur] Yeah. Thank you. So, Sleepwalker, I'm curious how you came up with that. That's a good question. I guess I just kinda see people as these zombies just kinda going through the motions every day, sleepwalking. I'd say I'm one of those zombies too. I can get to that. What about you, Arthur? How'd you get into acting? Like I said last night, I've been doing this since I was five years old. I guess it stems from my father. Let's just say he was a loose cannon and when I was young, my mother wanted to get me away from that as much as possible. So when I was young, she signed me up for acting classes. I started doing that and it's led me to this point. Well, you've done pretty damn well for yourself. You should be proud of that. I guess I'm just scared. I'm scared that these violent roles I portray are just slowly turning me into him. So why do you think he chose us? I mean there's millions of actors, directors, musicians. I don't get what makes us so special. 'Cause we're all fucked up in the head. [anxious piano music] [ominous electronic warbling] [tense violin tones] [glass tapping] [upbeat country rock music] [mid tempo drumbeat] I see you're not drinking, which is admirable. But you gotta think, you're in a position most people would kill for. You're at a beautiful home with one of the world's most acclaimed directors and other successful creators and yet, you seem to not be enjoying yourself. It's not that, it's just something happened to me recently and I don't like not feeling in control anymore. No time for control. Beautiful day, isn't it? Yes. [anxious piano, violin music] [tense metallic tones] "Pulp Fiction's" overrated. Are you out of your goddamn mind? Look, you're a musician. I wouldn't expect you to understand. But "Pulp Fiction" is a stroke of genius. "Fight Club," Fight Club," now that is a film. You could boast Tarkovsky all the live long day if you want to but "Fight Club" is prime cinema. Honestly, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Your last album was garbage. Are you fucking kidding me? Coming out to my work, I literally had a number one on the billboard, you know how hard that is? I don't care, it's my opinion. Nick. I don't know much about you or where you come from. Tell me a little bit about yourself. I mean, honestly not much to tell. I bounced around a lot as a kid. Never really knew my dad but was always pretty inspired by music. That was pretty much my sanctuary. I made a band with my friends. I mean, got picked up by a label, did some shows, saw some success but eventually broke up 'cause of creative differences. It's probably how I lost all my friends but I mean, that's how it goes when you're creative. - You got a girl? - No, I don't have a girl. But you know how that story goes. Fucking everything with a heartbeat. Honestly, I would like a girl but I never really met one that has good intentions, you know? I'm always on the road meeting so many people, everyone just wants different things and I don't know, I guess it's what comes with the industry, comes with the job. One day maybe. There was once a story of a Saint, Saint Francis of Assisi. This man was a Prince, a partier, an heir. One day, some say he heard the voice of God speak into his ear. He gave up his old life and occupied a new one. One of simplicity, one of purity. Later on, he underwent an experience known as the stigmata, otherwise known as the wounds of Christ. To him, this was not suffering, no. To him, this was ecstasy. Imagine the feeling. Anyways, he went on to worship the sun, the moon, the sands. He would save worms from roads so they were not crushed. And he went on to become the Great Saint. A beautiful story, isn't it Arthur? - You up for a scrap? - Yeah. Logan, tell us when. [tense metallic tones] Fight. Are you fucking kidding me? [thuds] [tense spidery tones] Arthur, what the fuck, man? You could have fucking killed him. Dude, what? We have to fucking help him. Ecstasy. I gotcha. You all right? Come on, we're going right there. [tense violin tones] [insects chirping] You'll be all right, okay? I'm gonna take care of you. Lay down right here. Why are we by the pool? We just gotta get away from those guys for a second. - You need anything? - No, no. - I'm just gonna sit here. - Okay. You let me know. [anxious piano music] Andrew. Something's not right here. It's in the air. How do you mean? I paint because I had loving parents who pushed me in the direction of creativity. But there was always more. I dream and when I dream, I see things. - What kind of things? - Horrible things. I once had a dream that my house was burning with my family inside of it. I woke up to my house ablaze. I was the only one able to escape. I couldn't sleep for months. That's terrible. I'm really sorry. I changed my name. I occupied a new life. One of purity. [anxious violin music] You know, your art, it's so bright and colorful. I never would've known you had such a dark past. The colors of fire and smoke. I had a dream before I came here. I saw the doctor. I saw his mask here. I don't know what it meant. I don't know what it means, but it was unsettling. So you've seen him too. He wanders. He's lurking, he's watching us. Who is he? [Flynn] I don't know. Can I ask you a question? [Flynn] Yeah. You take medication? I do. You think you should be drinking on it? No. Listen, I don't feel in control here. There's no time for control, Andrew. [anxious piano music] [glass clanks] Quite the show you put on. What are you talking about? [glass clanks] I don't understand. I don't understand what happens when I'm here tomorrow and this new project becomes mine. You just gotta be patient, okay? [Arthur's fists thud] I'm not patient, I've never been patient. How do I get it? That you gotta find out for yourself. The movies you're in are pretty violent, right? A lot of training, I presume? It's funny, the more real the violence looks on screen, the more audiences respond. It's interesting because if it were to be real and an audience just believed it was staged, they would applaud, unbeknownst to its haunting reality. You have to be psychotic to do that. The greatest usually are. [low, anxious tones] [tense violin tones] Andrew, sit down and keep me company. Where is everybody? I think Flynn and Arthur went to bed and Nick is resting by the pool. It's been a long day. I would say so. I've been thinking a lot. What do you know about astral travel? Astral travel? Yeah, like a person leaving their physical body and traveling the universe in any way they so choose. I mean I've heard of it but I don't really know much about it. You know how there's no evidence, scientific evidence of the human soul? But I think it's so ignorant to think we're just here to multiply. You know, we are the eyes of the universe watching itself and sometimes, you don't like what you find. You know, I know what happened to you. What? I didn't feel comfortable talking to you about it but we had a good day today and I figured you can tell me a little bit about it. How about you take a drink and tell me about it? If you know what happened to me, then why would you ask me if I wanted a drink? Take a drink and tell me about it, Andrew. Okay. So I went down to Dallas where she worked. She wanted to introduce me to her friends and so we went out and I was the one driving that night and she asked me right before we got in the car if I was good to drive. I said yes [ominous electronic warbling] and I put the key in the ignition. That was the biggest mistake of my life. You know what happens next. You killed your sister. [Andrew sniffling] It's all right. It's all right, I'm going to sleep now, okay? Have a good night, Atlas. [insects chirping] [anxious piano music] [Nick splashes] [tense violin tones] We have to call the cops. We don't need to call the cops. Nick was a druggie, I found heroin in his bags. He was high and he fell into the pool and he drowned. He was an artist on the run. He had no family. Careers will be ruined if police were to get involved, if press were to get involved and none of us here want that. This weekend was a secret. It remains a secret. It does not exist. You will all understand by the end. Okay, Andrew? Okay. Arthur? Yeah. Flynn? Flynn? Yeah. There are shovels in the shed. We bury him. [tense metallic ensemble music] [ominous violin music] Good work, men. Let's go back to the pool. Drinks on me. [shovels clanking] What have we done, Flynn? [Flynn] Where are we? Where's Arthur? You feeling okay? I had another dream last night. The one with my parents. But it was me who burnt the house down. That is why I survived. That's not real. [Flynn] I don't know what's real, Andrew. I don't remember. [tense metallic music] [door creaks] [heartbeat pounding rapidly] [Flynn grunting] [tense warbling electronic, violin tones] [ominous violin tones] Who are you? What are you doing to us? [door creaks] [tense metallic music] Flynn, are you out here? Come on man, we gotta go right now. Flynn? [tense warbling electronic tones] Oh shit, Flynn. Arthur, what have you done? Don't you know he's done something to us? You're not yourself. [tense metallic, warbling music] [light tense piano tones] [gun cocks] [gun clicks] [Arthur grunts] [gun cocks] [classical violin music] [film reel rattling] What the hell is going on? Why don't you put down the gun? I'm not gonna hurt you. Hurt me, you're not gonna hurt me? I'll fucking shoot you right now if you don't tell me what's going on. Allow me. It's called HEIR, H-E-I-R. In 1800s France, there was a man named Josephin Paillat. He began an Academy, one that worshiped art. There is spirituality in what we do. Religion will die, but art will remain forever. When churches burn and temples crumble, we will praise in the concert hall. When priests betray and idols become human, we will pray to the ones who give us stories and songs. This is our fate, Andrew. What are you talking about? What many don't know is that the Academy is the reason for pop culture today. The most influential artworks and films have been curated in order to choreograph modern day thought. The world has been hypnotized. You, here, have been hypnotized. So the vial in your bedroom, that's what that is. Like those who came before me, I have learned about hypnosis and I needed a little extra help. It's called scipolomi, it gives the taker a sense of obedience. I wanted to gather the greatest creative minds at the zenith of their lives to see what they would do. You were the most repellent because of your mind, you survived because of the strength of your mind. There is no escaping the hypnosis for the ordinary. It's in the films you watch, in the books you read, in the art you're moved by and the songs you love. Some like me just know how to use it to orchestrate it, to create it. This script in my hand is the next link in a century-long chain of true hypnotic, spiritual art. And it's yours. Why don't you make it? I haven't been chosen. The Academy wants you, your vision, not mine. What is it even about? [anxious violin music] Tell me, what is the film about? It's a beautiful gun in your hand, isn't it? Yes. Please. [anxious piano music] [gunshot booms] [keyboard clicking] [anxious piano music]
