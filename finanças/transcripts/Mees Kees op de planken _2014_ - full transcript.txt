Come on Teach, you can do it. - It's not scary. Just take a run. - Yes, Teach, come on. Jump, Teach. - When you jump from that height... ...the chance of an accident is... - 100 percent. You don't have to, if you're too scared. Guys, I think I'd rather go down the steps. Cannonball... Mom? Hi, son. I suddenly felt like being outside. I'm pulling out all the old branches. Good, right? Nice, huh? Outside. Wonderful. I wish it could stay like this forever. Mister Twister On Stage K. I. T. F. - Z. U. - P. L. - W. Q. Test! The Cito test. This test determines which level of high school you can handle. Very important. And kind of fun. But we don't need a test. People can tell we're good students. Yes, can't you just write them a letter? The/'re the cool dudes of the class The/ don't like tests Shove them up /our... Chimney. - It has to rhyme with 'class'. Mass. - Grass. Bass. - Glass. Silence, class! And ass rhymes with class. - Mister Casey! I don't want to keep saying this, but I heard you as loud as my... Gas. - Sep! But it rhymes with class too. You can rhyme endlessly, but that's not the point right now. Aha, the Cito. Very good, Mister Casey. It's very good you're working on it. Keep it up. Especially since you'll be performing this year's school play. Wonderful play: Farmers, Bakers and Countrymen. Wrote it myself. Lovely to do. The way plays are meant to be. With depth, truth, a song and a joke. \x22What's rustling in yonder field?\x22 \x22Do my ears detect a vagabond?\x22 \x22Ah, no! 'Tis the dark and stormy wind.\x22 \x22My ears rudely deceived me.\x22 Turned out to be the vagabond after all. Anyhow... The best thing is: You're going to play it in a real theater. In Joy's Desire. They let us use it each year. Be careful, though. It's a rest home. The people there need rest... ...and they're allergic to wild children. So no yelling or stomping... Orthumping. And no thumping. That's right. It's peaceful and quiet there. It's wonderful. Wonderful. It's sometimes... Dreus, Principal. One moment, please. Joy's Desire, 13 Old Post Horn Road. Theater's at the back of the building. I'll follow you. I'm back. It's about those blue lice bags. They haven't arrived yet. OK, shall we? Joy's Desire. This is it, guys. Too bad. It's Dreus, Principal. Where are those lice bags? We have code red. We can play hooky, Teach. - Not a bad idea. At my previous school we never went to a rest home. That must have been a nice school. Guys, these are people too. It's just that... ...they're a bit older. I think it's that way. Get lost. Sorry, sir. - We'll never do it again. I think it's at the end of the hallway, guys. Whoa... - Sweet. Awesome. Look, overthere. I didn't know it would be a real theater. OK, guys. You found it. How does it feel? The stage. Those wonderful boards. The robust curtain. The creativity. Do you feel the muse? The muse? She means the mice. Do you feel the mice? No, Sep. The muse. Inspiration, the power of the theater. Feel, feel. Feel... Everything here breathes theater. Industrious labor on the crop There can't be a more virtuous job Shoulderto shoulder jacket to jacket What the heck is this racket? Mrs. Goodheart, good to see you again. This is the final song the class has to rehearse for... Farmers, Bakers and Countrymen. Right? Good memory. - It's that time again. Mrs. Jolt, go ahead. - Not that same play again. Yes, nice andfamiliar. With the baker baking. Are we thumping? No, Mr. Stet. The baker baking. These children have to work hard right now. The costumes are at the back. Have a good rehearsal. Mister Casey, you're the director. Guys, hand out the books. 'Thou villain, what art thou filching from my bakery establishment?\x22 \x22Is that a soft and fluffy Chelsea bun with divine raisins...\x22 \x22...and cinnamon in thy pocket?\x22 Does it really say that? \x22When I look into the deep pools of thine eyes...\x22 \x22...all desire fails me to tarry on the right path of...\x22 Maybe we'll have to get used to it. Teach, seriously? This is so not cool. What's wrong? Stage fright, or something? Hey, guys. Look how it burns. - But dad... You didn't expect the old hut to blaze like that, did you? It was my hut. I don't play in it that often anymore... A hut is for little kids. You're big now. Big? - Yes, big. Everything changes then. Why does everything have to change? OK, guys. The Cito test. It's an important and big step. Yes? - Have we practiced enough, Teach? Of course. We stuck to the schedule, didn't we? And we'll be doing something extra. Let's think of something that will earn all of us an A+. Yes, an A+. With the Cito it's 550. 550, 550, 550... Let's do something with the twins. A system whereby they give us the answers. With their hands. With sign language. - With smoke signals. With smell signals. They fart the answers. B is two farts. - And C three farts. Guys, guys... Not this time. Everyone takes their own test. But what we could do... ...is... We'll make crib sheets. Ooh, Teach. - Really? Use small handwriting and you can get a lot on it. There you go. - But Teach, crib sheets... They're not allowed, are they? - Here, you take two. Crib sheets are very useful. Write down what you always forget. Write it as tiny and precisely as possible. When you're done... ...fold it in half... ...and again... ...and you put it... ...in your... ...mouth and eat it in one bite. It's candy paper. - Yes, with edible ink. So how can we look at them during the test? You can't, Fred, but if you eat it... ...it's always with you in a way. You'll all be doing great with the Cito. You will. Good job, flat on your stomach. Good push-off. Come on. There we go. And again. Dive, Sep. Dive. Go ahead and dive. Hey, Teach. - Hey, Tobias. What are you doing? - Floating. It helps me think. I do it at home in the bathtub. When I'm stuck, for a test or something. You have to do a test as well? - Yes, kind of difficult. To become a teacher, officially. - Andthen? Then I might be able to stay at your school. Even when you guys are gone. Guys, it's not that bad. There are also fun parts, jokes. If you understandthe language. Well, that part about the vagabond who befriends the baker... ...and can go to the harvest festival? No, not really, Teach. - No. No... not really, right? There's one fun part in it. - Yes, there's one fun... Which part? The mice stealing the baker's bread. If only the whole play was about that. - About mice? Yes, the mice are starring. - And they throw a party. But that's a wedding, because two mice are in love... ...and they steal foodfrom the bakery and it's a full moon... ...and at midnight all the food comes alive. There are croissants, carrots and strawberries... ...andfrench fries and a hot dog... ...and they don't want to be eaten. So at first they fight and then become friends... ...and they chase away the baker... ...and go to the wedding of the mice... ...and they all live happily ever after. That's fun, right? Yes, Teach. Can't we do that? What Lieke said: the mice party. But how will we tell Dreus? She wrote this. But she kept talking about mice. Muse, Sep. That was the muse. - It only differs one letter. Exactly. A difference of one letter. The I. And that's the I of improvising. Isn't that allowed with a performance? - It's necessary, even. So we won't change anything. We improvise... ...and tell Dreus' play from an another perspective. But Teach, how about the costumes? Can we use all that stuff? We've seen that play about the baker a hundredtimes already. There we go. The wedding dress. Add some milk. Some salt. That much? - Yes, careful. And then in the pan. Just let it cook for a while. How do you know I like omelets? I'll only say one thing: lice bags. Good morning, Els. Are you OK? I'm just fine, Duifje. Thank you. Hey, Tobias. - Hello. Sep? Are you ready for it as well? Forthe Cito. Cito... Oh, right. I think so. A new school next year. Exciting. Wait a minute. - Dad... Two bites. Two bites. Breakfast is very important. It's good for your brains, your memory. You rememberthings better. Here, have another bite. - Dad... Two bites for Tobias. Oatmeal, it's important. No, thank you. Leave them alone. It's exciting enough. They have to eat, drink... It's important. Drink... drink. Good luck, honey. You too, Tobias. - Thank you. Go get 'em. Bye. - Bye. Guys, a bottle of water for on the road. It'll be fine, honey. Here, you probably forgot yours. No, it's your good luck charm. I have plenty left. Next year we won't be in Mister Casey's class anymore. Afterthe Cito and the play... ...we have to say farewell to Mister Casey. Not until after the summer. I miss him already. A girl at my previous school liked her kindergarten teacher so much... ...she failed every year. - Really? Still in kindergarten when she was 12. I'm going to thump you. If we fail, we might be with Mister Casey forever. Sure. Good one. Ready, guys? Completely, Teach. Good. Cito. Take yourtime to think... ...because there is plenty of time. If you don't understand something, read it again. And if you still don't know the answer... ...rememberthose crib sheets in your stomach. OK? OK. Three. Two. One... go ahead. Hey, Tobias... Go ahead. Go. - Go, go, go. Teach, I can't handle it any longer. - This way, Winston. It's fine like this. That's forthe baker. But I think the bed is too heavy as a fruit basket. So we need an extra pair of hands to help with the bed. Got a problem on your hands? - No, I don't. When should I enter with the hand? - It's getting out of hand. No, they're not. Tim and Tom, step out of the fruit basket now. And enterthe baker's hand. - Exactly. The baker's hand is entering? Yes, now. The mice run away. The mouse goes in the cupboard. To the left and you guys step forward. - Let's have the basket now. Very good, guys. - Hasna's wedding dress. Oh, right. Is the wedding dress ready? We can't manage. - Someone has to help us. You know someone who's good at making her own clothes. Do I? - Yes, she's very nice. She has a dog. And she likes you. My mom? But she doesn't sew clothes. Teach, think. - You make out with her sometimes. Oh, her. You should ask her. - Yes, Teach. OK... Casey? - Hello, hey... Hey, hi. Hey, Marie-Louise, hi. I just wanted to ask if you... ...if you wanted to make a wedding dress. Casey... Really? Yes. Well, I meant forthe performance of my class. To get married. Not that I wouldn't want to, but... I mean... Hi. Thanks. Bye. Bye. - Not you. Casey... Are you still there? Trouble with the girls? Not really girls. It's one girl. A very nice girl, though. But it's as if I say the wrong thing all the time. The wrong fling? No, that I... that I stumble over my words. That's love for you, son. As wobbly as an egg, as squishy as a mussel... ...and as rickety as a camel. My mom says I just have to jump in with both feet. With a sheet? No, feet. Jump in with both feet. Oh, into the pool? That's a great idea. I'd like to do that again some day. Swimming! Really? - Yes, but... ...we don't do that very often in the rest home. That's too bad, you know. There's school swimming this afternoon and we need some adult supervisors. Really? Yes! Loop it around and pick it up like this. Guys, who wants fries? My treat. Yes, Food Project. Overthere. - Grab them quickly. Thanks. Yummy. Mine taste like potato. There we go. And then? The mice rescue the baker's living food... ...and the mice and the living food become friends... ...and they flee together. - And find a secret corridor. Is there a secret corridor? - They'll make one. Isn't that fun? Then the entire building... - Dreus! That might not be a problem for you... ...but when you're the 'head' here... I'll call you. Right. Am I interrupting? No, it's just the performance. Ah, the play. It will be wonderful. You must have so much fun with the baker and the vagabond... ...and the harvest festival at the end when everyone pulls together. Wonderful. But I'm here for something else. I have news. Very good news. Your teacher is coming back. Miss Sanne. Isn't that great? She's doing well. Physically not as well as emotionally, but she'll be fine in the end. She'll be back tomorrow and everything will return to normal. Aukje? What about Mister Casey? About Mister Casey? Oh, Mister Casey. Well, Mister Casey won't be far away. Mister Casey... Fine. Bas, Tom, Jelle, Juna, Mara, llaine... ...Giovan, Daley, Lisa... ...and... My name's Mikayla. Mikayla... Right. Good morning. - Good morning. We made a cake. - I made an apple pie. Or an apple pie, so you have a choice. - Enjoy. Bye, we're going... - Thanks. Sep and Tobias, late on Miss Sanne's first day. Hurry up and sit. Well, Miss Sanne, it's great you're back. Have a nice first day. Good luck and have fun. Thank you, Ms. Dreus, I... Well... I'm back. I... I brought... ...photographs. Of Jons. My son. He's so cute. And sweet and small... ...and cuddly. OK, let's just start. With math. Yes! On page... Page 39, Miss. - Thank you, Aukje. OK. Oh, right. Fun, math. What do you do with 15 and 3... ...to get 5? Tom, Tim... Tom, Miss. - Right, Tom. I'd say: multiply by 10, then add and then divide by 36. But the question is: Why? No, it's a lot simpler. Come on... Think. You have 15 and 3 and you want to have 5 left. What should you do? But Miss, we don't say it like that anymore. No. OK, but it's not that hard. I know. 15 minus 3 is 12. If you subtract 7, what do you have left? Ta-da... Five. But the question remains... - Why would you do that? Division. It's division. You have 15 and 3 and you want to have 5 left. You do that by dividing. Look at the top of page 39. The sum is there. It's very easy. Mister Case/, Mister Case/... Yes, Aukje... Mikayla... You can do it. Look. One, two, three... Come on. High five. Right after each other. Good. Pick up the pace. Melon? No Anika, banana. First he needs a bite without banana and then fruit with banana. And with banana is in a yellow container. You're feeding it to him now? That's not good. You're not supposedto do that. But guys, this is... That isn't in the play at all. Sure it is. Look at page 13. Look. The mice stole a croissant from the bakery. The clock struck twelve... ...and all the food came alive. The strawberry, the piece of cheese... ...and the bag of fries. The ice cream and the sausage. And the bananas. - That's us. And then they all went to the wedding of the mice. The dress will come later. - Understand? We show the other perspective. - Of the mice. That's improvising. It's part of a performance. Understand? Are you OK, Miss? Bab/sitter We're going back to the school. Let's go. Now. But Miss, we still have to rehearse. I have to go home. - But Miss... Now. Now! This is bad. Very, very bad. What on earth happened to your costumes? It's forthe performance. - Fred... The performance? The play? There is no croissant in Farmers, Bakers and Countrymen. Let alone bananas. Actually... we changed the play a bit. Changed? Your play... Well... The children found it somewhat... The children found it somewhat... ...complicated and... I thought it might be good to improvise to get rid of the stage fright. Improvise? I thought it might be nice to do something the kids came up with. The kids? Mister Casey, kids don't know what real theater is. Only teachers know that. Real teachers. Miss Sanne was so shocked by what you did to my play... ...that she had a nervous breakdown. - Oh, no. She probably won't be back. Certainly not this school year. Is it a good idea... Forthe sake of the kids, of course... ...that I return to my own class? In your own class? Mister Casey, this is your own class: kindergarten. I'll be teaching Miss Sanne's spirited class forthe rest of the year. Oh. - Exactly. Oh. I hope you studied hard for your own test. A lot is riding on that now. And this has to stop as well. Come along. The wedding dress! Leave. - Dreus. Leave, or Dreus will see you. Dreus forthe rest of the year. And no more Mister Casey. Wouldn't it be good if we could finish the yeartogether? It will be different afterthat, anyway. I screwed up my Cito. On purpose. To be held back a year. You're joking, right? I wanted to stay with Mister Casey, but now we have Dreus. Seppie, son. Come on, we have to go to soccer. Here. Do you still hang out in that mess? Let's go. - Bye. Here you go. You're getting really big. Not as big as you think. The baker. \x22Oh woe, what do my eyes behold?\x22 \x22Alas, is that a vagabond in mine barn?\x22 \x22Oh husband, 'tis not...\x22 That's the baker's wife, OK? \x22Oh husband, 'tis not what thou fearest.\x22 'This vagabond means us no harm.\x22 \x22Baker, I prithee, be thou not heartless.\x22 \x22Forsooth, all I want is a hunk of bread.\x22 \x22Oh, husband.\x22 \x22No, my patience is wearing thin.\x22 'This vagabond deserves a kick in the pants.\x22 \x22No, husband. No!\x22 \x22No, baker. No!\x22 \x22In the oven with thee. In the oven, yes.\x22 The oven... Vagabond. \x22In the oven, in the oven.\x22 \x22No, husband. No, husband!\x22 \x22Oh no, oh no, what is happening?\x22 Baker's wife. 'Woe is me, woe is me.\x22 The windmill is turning. Now it's your turn. Page 1, get your books. It's time, boys and girls. I have the results of the Cito test. Come and get them. Two at a time. 547! - I did really well. Thank you. Thank you. Tobias... You know what this means. Such bad results. Yes, Ms. Dreus. Look, apple pie and whipped cream. Apples forthe vitamins, good for a growing boy. Casey is very good at this. But not as good as me. He's taking that test this afternoon. All he eats these days is crib sheets. Harley needs to go for a walk. Casey would love it if you and Harley pick him up from school. Really? What do you think? Come on, Harley. Come on, get it. Come on. Harley, come on. OK, Mister Casey. Casey. Hey, Harley. Where did you come from? OK, nice. Come on. Harley. Mom? Are you OK? I just need a lie-down. Are you coming to the performance? Well... You know... We'll see, OK? It doesn't matter, mom. It won't be good, anyway. Come in, guys. Get out your NatuNique workbook and start on the next lesson. I'll be... I have to put out a fire. Shouldn't we be rehearsing forthe play? The performance. That's right. Get your coats and wait outside. I have to take care of something. Mister Casey, it's time for a nice cup of coffee. Want a cookie? - No... Mister Casey? Mister Casey. There are lice. - I know, Ms. Dreus. The lice moms wanted to have coffee first... I need you in the class now. - In the class? Take them to the rest home and do some play exercises. Have them rehearse the play. The right play, my play. That's all. That's all? - No more improvising and all that. I have... Something else entered my head. A leak in the elementary grades. - A leak? Yes, in the secondary grades. Go, go, go. The lice moms will manage without you. I don't know what's worse. A lesson by Dreus or theater by Dreus. They're both just as bad. - Depends on whether she'll sing again. Who's going to sing? - Teach! Are you back? Just for a little while. I actually had to comb for lice, but... Dreus asked me to do play exercises with you. Probably for Dreus' play. Yes, but the exercises can be fun. Come on. Hey, baker... Is that your wife or is that your daughter? Dreus, Principal. You took your time with those lice bags and it's too late now. Thanks for nothing. Results Teacher Test We're not /et going home there's no wa/, there's no wa/ We're not /et going home for m/ mom is awa/ Even if m/ mom was home we wouldn't go, we wouldn't go Even if m/ mom was home... Teach... Are you back with your old, new performance? Not really. Dreus threw out all the costumes. - You're kidding. Did I hear you right? Threw out all the costumes? Yes. Even if we wanted to, we couldn't perform it. But it's nice to see all of you again. I have to move on. Bye. - OK. Bye. - It's all right, son. Hey, are you OK? Teach, what do you do when you have a real problem? A real problem? Well, I don't know... I always say: I'll wait and see. I'll wait and see. And? How does it feel? When you're worried about something, it's often not as bad as you think. Problems are show-offs. They pretend to be biggerthan they really are. Show-offs? Teach, I screwed up my Cito on purpose. That's not really a show-off. No. Come on. Ms. Dreus? - Mister Casey. Ms. Dreus... - I'm busy. Sorry, this cant wait. It's about Tobias. Right, that bad Cito. Nasty business. It's a mistake. Tobias screwed it up on purpose to be held back a year. So he could stay in my class. - Screwed up on purpose? Can he take the test again to do it properly this time? No, you only take a Cito once. Those are the rules. But there are exceptions to the rules. I know exactly what Tobias and all of my students are capable of. Tobias was affected by stage fright to take the next step. Please, let us help him to make up forthis. I do like the energy you put into sticking up for your students. Apparently, you know quite well what you're talking about. Final score: A+ I know: I'll fail as well. It's easy. I'll come up with something. A memory lapse, or my dog ate my Cito results. But you don't have a dog. - OK, my sister ate it. What did your dad buy now? Guys... This is your new hut. Not as cool as that real hut, but it's a compromise. Whoa, dad. It's a cool compromise. Why are you just standing there? Come on in. We'll just leave it here and you can play in it. And about that growing up... You don't need to for now. I've been thinking about being young. Being young is the new getting old. It is. So I'm getting young again too. Yes, I'm getting young again too. Nice and young, nice and young. Tobias? Tobias? Teach. - They're show-offs. You're not failing. - Really? Dreus says you can retake the test tomorrow. Retake the test? - Yes. And you know what else? I'll be back in the class. - Really? Yes. Farmers, Bakers and Countr/men Showing toda/ Isn't she here? No. Ready, guys? - We look like idiots, Teach. Can't we... - ...call it off, Teach? Yes, Teach. - Call it off. Move aside, move aside. The entire rest home helped. All our costumes. - Knitted. We can perform it our way. - Thank the Lord. The carrot's hat. Guys, one mouse on offer. Thank you. Teach, the wedding dress! Marie-Louise. Ladies and gentlemen... Welcome to our annual school play.
