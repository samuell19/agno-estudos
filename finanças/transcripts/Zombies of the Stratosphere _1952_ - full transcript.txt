(questing music) - [Man] The unidentified aircraft is now less than 50 miles off the coast. It's still on a course which will bring it close to this city. - Is there time to intercept it with your rocket? - No, at the rate that ship is traveling it'll be out of radar range before we could get off the ground. - Unless it lands. - Then ground defense will handle it, Bob. Unless Mr. Steele thinks we can help? - Yes, Larry, I do. It's the duty of my department to handle all matters and matters in world security, and you're one of my executives. I realize that your work has usually been in the interplanetary zone. In this case I think you ought to take charge, both on land and in the air. - Very well. I suppose the regular defense network has already been alerted? - Yes, they're standing by until we see what that ship's going to do. - Help me on my flying suit, Bob. I may have to get into action in a hurry. - Prepare for landing. (suspenseful music) - [Man] The unidentified aircraft has just disappeared from the radar screen as it was passing over the Morongo Hills. - It must have landed somewhere in those hills. - Probably. I'll fly out there and try to find it. - Good, and get there quicker than the ground forces. (jet zooming) - They picked you up on radar. The whole country is looking for you. - That was to be expected. But if we transfer our cargo quickly, we can get away before they locate us. Help him with the boxes. (dramatic music) That seems to be all. Take off at once. Yes, sir. Get in the back with Shane. (dramatic music) (rumbling) (rocket hissing) - [Larry] Calling Bob. Calling Bob. - Come in, Larry. - I just spotted their rocket taking off. I can't possibly catch it but I'm going to check out what happened and where it landed. - [Bob] Good, keep us posted. - Okay. (dramatic music) (alarm beeping) (loud thud) - Someone's on top. (dramatic music) (gun firing) - What's happening there? - Someone's on top of the truck - I'll shake him off. (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) - He's still there. - Run under those trees and knock him off. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) Shane, you and Narab will take the truck to the cave and unload the supplies. Roth and I will be there later to help you as soon as we conclude our arrangements with Dr. Harding. - Yes, sir. (engine revving) - This side door will take us right to his laboratory. Nobody will spot us. - Very well. (suspenseful music) - What are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be delivering those plans-- - Yeah, I know but we got a better deal here. - What are you? - I am Marex, a native of the planet Mars. Perhaps not quite a human being by Earthly standards. However I can assure you that my people are much further advanced in intelligence and scientific achievements than you Earth men. - What are you doing here? - For some time I have been in contact with your assistants Roth and Shane, making arrangements for a project I'm undertaking here. I will need your technical assistance and the facilities of your laboratory. - And why do you think I'm gonna help you? - Because I'm in a position to inform your government that you've been selling atomic secrets to an unfriendly foreign power. The results of such an exposure would be much more unpleasant for you than the alternative I'm allowing. - What is this project you're planning? - The orbit of our planet Mars is so far from the sun that climatic and atmospheric conditions there are much inferior than those on Earth. But in spite of these physical handicaps my people have developed the means of correcting this situation. - You mean you can change the orbit of the planet? - Exactly. But of course to accomplish that we must first clear the orbit of those interference. So my mission here is to plan an H-bomb explosion sufficiently strong to send Earth spinning out into space and leave room for my own planet. - That would mean the destruction of the world and everyone on it. - That need not concern you if you are safe with us on Mars. Unless you would prefer to await the event in the Federal Penitentiary. - What would you expect me to do? - We will construct the Hydrogen Bomb in a well-concealed cave which I have already selected. The critical materials and the necessary electronic equipment have already been brought down from Mars and are now stored at my island base in the Pacific. I'm moving them from there to the cave in my rocket ship. - Then why do you require my help? - Because we will need additional supplies such as uranium, steel, and other structural materials. We will also require the use of this laboratory to assemble parts of the bomb. - Very well. What comes first? - I will give you a list of what is required. And while you're obtaining these items I will go to the cave and get the basic construction started. (ominous music) - How long can you guys stay underwater? - Half an hour, perhaps a little longer. The atmosphere on Mars is so thin we've adapted ourselves to live on very little oxygen. (ominous music) - Is that the last of it? - Yes, sir. - Good. Now I have another assignment for you. Dr. Harding has learned that the freight shipment of the uranium will be passing through this area today. The train or local freight will stop at Borella Junction about 2:15. You and Shane will take over there. - How many men will be on it? - I'm not sure, so you better make arrangements for additional help. Now it won't be safe to stop to unload the uranium at the junction. Take the train out into the hills somewhere between the junction and Gomez Sighting. Find a good hiding place for the uranium. They'll pick it up later with a truck. - Okay. - You wouldn't wanna be caught with that map on you. Burn it. - I'll start lining things up. - Very well. I will be in the inner cave. You can report to me by radio. - Right. - That does it, you're all set to go. - But that ruck may be miles away by now. - Not too far. The signal from that radio sending unit I planted in that truck is still coming in strong. All I have to do is fly down the beam. (suspenseful music) So far so good. Let's see what the infrared light brings out. - Why, it's nothing but a railroad map. - Yes, but the section between Borella Junction and Gomez Sighting underlined. - Which means what? - It could mean something's gonna happen there so we gotta try to find out what. We've got a lot of country to cover so we better split up the job. You two go to the junction, check on things there. I'll start at Gomez Sighting and follow back up the line. (train chugging) (bell ringing) - Larry! - Isn't that Bob who's on top of that freight car? - Yes, when we got here those men were stealing the train. Bob jumped on it to try and stop them. - Any way to stop that train? - No, my key is out. They must have cut the wire after they saw me. - There is the brake, can you fix it? - I can fix it but it'll take time. - Maybe I can catch them in the car. - Not much chance. The road only gets near the tracks in a few places. - Is that old tank working? - Yes, we just unloaded for some farmer who's gonna make a track drive. - Maybe I can cut across country and stop that train? - You better try. If it keeps going you'll crash it through the passenger train head on. (suspenseful music) (engine revving) (train chugging) - Tie him to that brake wheel. Use those. (suspenseful music) - Isn't there any place to stop a passenger train? - There's one if I can only call it in time. I almost got this fixed. - It's about time we stop and unload the stuff, isn't it? (engine revving) How'd that get on our trail? - I don't know but they got on us somehow. - We're not gonna much luck unloading a car with uranium with that thing chasing us. - Yeah, we better forget it. Let's make our getaway while we can. (suspenseful music) (train chugging) (horn blasting) - It's too late. The passenger train's already gone through the junction. Only one more chance now. If I can raise Gomez Sighting they can derail the freight there. (train chugging) (suspenseful music) (engine revving) horn blasting) (loud crashing) (questing music) (racy dramatic music) (train horn blasting) - We better jump! - That was too close for comfort. I wonder what that was all about. - I don't know, there must be something on that train they were planning to steal. We'll check with the railroad company and find out. - There is one more source of uranium but it'll take time to make the necessary arrangements to get it. - Then start them at once. We must have uranium for the primary reactor in our H-Bomb. Everything must be ready by the time the Earth reaches this position for that is point at which the explosion of our hydrogen bomb will alter the Earth's rotation sufficiently to send it out spinning out in space. Plus we must have the work completed well before that date to allow time for our escape to Mars. - I'm not looking forward to this trip to Mars. - It won't be dangerous and you'll only be there a short time. Our controlled explosions on Mars have already been set. As soon as the Earth's orbit is clear we'll move Mars in to occupy it, then we can enjoy the same atmosphere and climate on Mars that you now have here. Our immediate problem is to find a safe place to land the rocket load of electronic equipment that I have to bring in from my island base. - That cart that we find uranium was the only thing on the train of any unusual value. - That's probably what they're after. We still can't take any chances. - Larry Martin's office. Yes, he's here. It's for you, Mr. Steele. - Steele speaking. Yes? Yes. Very well. They just picked up an unidentified aircraft coming in again. It's still a long way off and you may have a chance to intercept it. - I'll fly out the rocket and try it. - If you intercept it, what will you do? - Try to follow it and find out where its base is. (dramatic music) - Vehicle all set? - Yes, sir we got your orders. - Good. (suspenseful music) - Hiya, Larry. We're all set. - Good, let's go. - Ready? - Any time. - Fire pilot jet. - Fire pilot jet. - Fire main jets. - Fire main jets. (jet hissing) - [Larry] Calling Larry Martin's office. Larry Martin, calling Mr. Steele. - Hey, Larry, where are you? - We've just taken off. Is that other ship still on radar? - We lost them behind the map at the back of Lake Emerald. It may have landed there, you better check them. - Yes, sir. - Heading for Lake Emerald. (suspenseful music) - Here it comes. (suspenseful music) - Get this unloaded as fast as you can. I have heard on the radio that there's another rocket searching for me. - Okay, we'll dump it all out here and move it down with the boat later. (suspenseful music) - I can't see any sign of them but you could hide a squadron under those trees. We'll just cruise around a while to see if we can pick up something. - Right. (suspenseful music) - That's all, I'm taking off at once. - Okay. (suspenseful music) (rocket hissing) - There he is. They're just taking off. - We take after them? - Yes, but don't follow him too close. All we wanna do is find out where he's going. (suspenseful music) - We're gaining on him. - Good. (suspenseful music) We under control? - Just barely. Fuel pressure is dropping. Must have cracked a line. - We can't keep up with him now and we can't maneuver to get a shot at him. Let's head back to field. - Okay. - So now our next move is try to find out what that rocket ship was doing up there in the lake. - You didn't see any sign of a truck this time, did you? - No. There were no roads near the place where it landed, but it was close to the lake. If they unloaded anything it could be picked up by boat. - There are a lot of boats on that lake. - Yes, and we gotta check them all, so let's go. You two take one side of the lake, I'll take the other. - Right. (suspenseful music) - That's a load. - Okay, take it away. We'll wait here till you get back. - Right. (engine revving) (suspenseful music) - Hey. There's somebody snooping around our stuff. (gun firing) (gun firing) (engine revving) (gun firing) (questing music) (suspenseful music) (engine revving) - Well that's all we salvaged from the wreck of the speedboat. - What is it? - Well it's part of an electronic device but I've never seen one just like it before. - Neither have I. But it's certainly for some illegal project or they wouldn't be smuggling it by rocket ship. - That's a reasonable guess but it still doesn't tell us just what it is. - No but I think I know who can tell us. Dr. Harding. - Yes, he's done a lot of research in electronics, but he never seem to be willing to work with anyone else. - I know he has reputation for being very secretive but I have the authority to demand his cooperation. Let's box this up and take it out to him. (suspenseful music) - Well we have enough material here to keep going for a while. Fortunately my island base can replace the parts that were lost. - How about getting it here? They'll be watching for the rocket from now on. - The country which was trying to buy my atomic power plant designs is still on the market. They would probably let us use one of their submarines, if we were willing to give them the designs. - Why not? They'll never get a chance to use them. In a short while we'll blast Earth off its orbit and send it spinning out through space so that our own planet Mars could take its place. All that matters now is to complete the H-bomb on time. How long would it take this unfriendly ally to deliver our shipment? - Judging from my past dealings with them, their submarine could deliver the material in the harbor in a week. - Good. Then make the necessary arrangements at once. - Roth, go to the harbor. Charter a suitable boat for one week from tonight. - Okay. (suspenseful music) - Calling X71. - Hey. There go the man who picked up that stuff from the rocket. (suspenseful music) You gonna arrest them? - After we find out where they're going. (suspenseful music) - What can I do for you? - We wanna charter a boat. Just an open job, about 25 feet, but fast. - When do you want it? - One week from tonight. - Well I don't usually charter my small boats for night trips. - We won't be going out in the harbor. We won't need it for more than a couple of hours. - I don't know, I'll show you what I've got. - You're under arrest. Search them, Bob. (grunting) Ever see those two before? - No, but I sure like to see them again. - I'm afraid they won't be back here. But we do know they got business in the harbor a week from tonight. And we'll be on hand to see what takes place. - Nothing in sight yet. - No, but we better keep looking. - It's about time that sub showed up, isn't it? - Yeah, but you won't see it. Even the boat will stamp up the buoys. (suspenseful music) - Hey, the buoys out there. (suspenseful music) - There's another one behind us. - Hey, what's that boat doing? - They're bringing up something out of the water. (suspenseful music) Maybe we'd better check on them. - Hey, there's a boat heading this way. We won't have time to pick up that other buoy, sink it. (gun firing) - I want that buoy. Stand by to pick it up. (suspenseful music) Good work. Now let's get after that gang. - Stop them! (gun firing) - Throw that net over in front of them. (suspenseful music) (engine dying out) - That net fault our prop up good. - They're landing at that old canning wharf. If we can clear that prop and get to my car in time we can still catch them. Let's get to work. (suspenseful music) Try toward the canning wharf. If you see any sign of them, call me on the radio. - Right. (engine revving) (gun firing) (engine revving) Calling Larry, calling Larry. - Come in, Bob. - They're heading north along Front Street in a black panel truck. You want me to follow them? - No I'll take over now. - Okay. (suspenseful music) - Pull over and stop. (suspenseful music) (questing music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Pull over and stop. (suspenseful music) - Have you seen any sign of the ship that dropped these buoys? - No, there was nothing else inside. They may have been brought in by submarine. - It's possible. We'll alert all patrol to be at constant watch in this area. We're obviously up against a very powerful enemy. We must prevent them from completing their project whatever it is. - And so the big question, what are they trying to do? - Well, all these instruments and the one we picked up from the rocket shipment are all electronic apparatus of some kind. - It's my guess that some enemy power is preparing to build A-bombs right here in this country. - And then use them here? - Afraid that may be it. We must use every means we can to stop them. - Well one thing the authorities should check up on all the supplies and material and equipment of this country that might be used for atomic devices. - All such supplies are under strict government control already. We'll ask the government authorities to recheck their security measures. - Let me know if you find anything suspicious. - Well, Larry. - Yes, Ross has already removed the Uranium from the mine. All you have to do is to meet him with the plan at the usual place. - Are you sure you can trust Ross from the men with the plane? I don't like letting strangers in on our projects. - They don't know anything about your plan to blast Earth out of its orbit so Mars can take its place. They just think they're furnishing me with Uranium for my own private use as they've done before. - Very well. - All right, Mr. Steele, we leave right now. - It looks like the security controls aren't as tight as Mr. Steele thought they were. The King Pin Mayan reports a shipment of high grade uranium ore stolen. - Stolen from the mine? - Yes, apparently it was loaded on the pack horses and taken out across the desert. They tried to follow the tracks but they lost it in rocky grounds. - So we gotta make a couple of Indians and trail them. Do I have to ride a horse? - No, but you may have to do some scrambling around on foot. (suspenseful music) You go on down this road. I'll fly over those hills in the west. We'll keep in touch by radio. - Right. (suspenseful music) - Okay boys, there they are. (plane zooming in) (horses galloping) (suspenseful music) - Calling Bob, come in, Bob. - Come in, Larry. - I've spotted them. They're loading the stuff on a plane on a dry lake about a mile west of where you are now. Drive cross country until I meet you. - Right. (suspenseful music) - They're just over the ridge, about a dozen of them. - That's a large order. - Yeah, we can't capture them all so we'll try to drive off the riders and grab the plane. We'll get in as close as we can before we open up on them. - Right. I brought these along. - Good. Let's go. Let's let them have it. - Right. (guns firing) - Dr. Harding promised there'll be no interference. - Shut up, will ya. You don't think this is our idea? Now look, we're nearly loaded. I'll hold them off until you can get this thing out of here. - You'd better. All right, hurry it up. (guns firing) - Turn those pack horses loose. We don't need them anymore. Run them across the lake towards them. They'll cover you. (guns firing) (horses galloping) - We're just about loaded. (guns firing) Take off. - Take off as fast as you can. (guns firing) - Hey, they're taking off. - These will stop them. (loud explosion) That did it. - Yeah, there won't be much fight left in that crew now. Calling Sue, calling Sue. - Yes, Larry, come in? - We recovered the Uranium. They were transporting it from the pack horses to a plane. We disabled the plane and have captured the two men in it. But the others escaped. - Do you have any idea who they were? - Yes. One of the prisoners talked. The leader was a mine foreman named Ross. I don't expect him to go back to the mine now but he had an appointment to meet two pay off men this afternoon. So I'm going to the mine and look for them. Is Mr. Steele still there? - Yes. - Ask him to phone the mine superintendent and arrange for me to get in. - I'll take care of it right away. - You make all the arrangements. Good luck. - Ross is supposed to be working down the lower level. - There must be a shaft somewhere ahead. - Hold it. I thought you folks might show up here. (gun fires) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (loud crash) (questing music) (suspenseful music) (grunting) - This is very serious. We must have Uranium for the construction of our H-bomb. Is there another source or supply? - I know where I can obtain some but the cost would be very high. And since we've lost the money we paid to Ross I'm afraid we can't afford them. - That isn't problem. Many of your banks are loaded with cash. - They're loaded with guards too. - Your part will be very minor and perfectly safe. On Mars we long ago learned to use mechanical devices for difficult or dangerous work. - You mean you could build a machine to rob the bank? - That's what the mouse do. Only you would call it a robot. A mechanical man whose movements we can control from a panel here in this laboratory. - Do we have the necessary material here to build one? - We can buy the necessary electronic parts and any sheet metal shop can construct the body for us. Well, we will need... - All right, we'll be there, thanks. Hey, Bob. It looks like Mr. Steele's campaign to learn anybody handling atomic supplies is paying off. That was a dealer in electronic equipment who reports a couple of strangers asking for some special tools. - Did he give it to them? - Not yet. He said he'd have the stuff for them in an hour. - That'll give us time to get on there and look them over. (suspenseful music) - Right on the minute. That's the store just ahead and we'll wait here. - There they are. Our two old pals. - Right. This is our chance to follow them to their headquarters. (suspenseful music) - You suppose that's their hideout? - Could be. (suspenseful music) Looks like they're getting ready to load something in the car. Let's get behind it. (suspenseful music) - Hey, it looks like a robot. - Hey, it's Martin. (guns firing) Get the car started, I'll keep them busy. (guns firing) - Shall we follow them? - No chance. They'll be gone before we can get to a car. At least we know they have a robot which they're probably going to use for some kind of dirty work. We'll tell the authorities to be on the lookout for them. If we can locate whoever operates it by remote control, we'll have the men we're looking for. - Calling M, calling M. - [Marex] Yes, Roth? - We're all set. - Very well I'll take over from here. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (fire hissing) (alarm ringing) - The cops will be here in a minute, hurry up! - [Man] Calling Car 16, calling car 1-6. Go to the Perennial Bank. Alarm ringing. - Get going. (alarm ringing) - They're all right now. - I'll see if I can pick it up. That robot's in action already. They just used it to rob the Perennial Bank. - They're robbing banks too? - Yes, Sue, it's the same gang all right. The police traced the getaway car through town but they lost them somewhere in the Morongo Hills. - Why that's where that rocket landed the first time. - Right. So there's a chance they might have headed for the same cave. I'm going to have a look. - Be careful. (suspenseful music) - You sure that box is water tight? - Absolutely. I'll radio Marex that you've arrived safely. You better wait to see if he has any further orders. - Okay. (suspenseful music) (water bubbling) (suspenseful music) - Get your hands up. Turn around. - Calling Marex, calling Marex. - [Marex] Come in Narab. - Roth and Shane got here with the money all right, but someone has just captured them at the outer cave. - Is the robot still there? - Yes. - Then I'll take over. - Go over that wall. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) - Now to finish him. - [Dr. Harding] There's an ax on the box right behind him. - [Marex] Yeah, that'll do it. (suspenseful music) (questing music) (suspenseful music) (grunting) - Now to finish him. - [Dr. Harding] There's an ax on the box right behind him. - Yeah, that'll do it. (suspenseful music) His master control's on the robot. - Calling Bob, calling Bob. - Come in, Larry. - The gang came to the cave all right. They got away but I've got the robot and the money must be here somewhere. Better come out and help me look for it. - You heard that? - Yes. You must stop him from finding that trap door. - They may have hidden in the shaft. There's sure no one else around here. I'm going in to find out. (suspenseful music) - Any luck? - Not yet, it's pretty dark down here. I'll try again. (suspenseful music) - What's the matter? - Help me up. - [Bob] How could anyone else have gotten in there? - There must be another water entrance from another cave but it was too dark to see. We'll pick up a diving helmet and underwater light and try again. We'll take the robot with us. When we examine it we might find some clue to the remote control operator who's been working it. - I heard all that. We must protect that tunnel entrance at all costs. I'll come out and help you. - [Narab] Yes, sir. - Don't you think we should construct our bomb in some other location? - No. That cave is at the exact point where my atomic explosion will be most effective in deflecting the Earth's rotation forcing it out of its orbit so that my planet Mars could take its place. - But if Larry Martin investigates that underwater tunnel. - Don't worry about Larry Martin. We now have a sure method of eliminating him. The robot is in his laboratory. Tonight you and Roth will break in there and then repair it. Then stand by the controls. And the next time Martin enters his laboratory send the robot into action. - And that should solve our problem. - Shane, you will take me out to the cave now. We must be on guard in case Martin returns there before you have a chance to get the robot working again. - Well, everything seems to be in perfect working order. Larry Martin is due for a very unpleasant surprise tomorrow. (suspenseful music) - Morning, Sue. - Morning. - Hiya, Bob. - Hi. - Everything ready? - Yes, there's the diving helmet and the underwater line. - Seems all right. - You got plenty of oxygen? - I think so, we will take along an extra tank. (suspenseful music) - Look out! (suspenseful music) (gun firing) - Throw the main switch. (suspenseful music) (electricity fizzing) We were lucky that time but I'll not take any more chances. While Bob and I are out the keep you take that thing apart in a lot of little pieces. - Right. - It's no use. I'll warn Marex. Calling Marex. Calling Marex. - [Marex] Come in, Harding. - The Robot attack failed. Larry Martin disabled it. - That means Martin will be coming to search this cave at any time. Tell Roth and Shane to come out here immediately. - [Dr. Harding] Yes, sir. - Do we have any explosives that can be detonated under water? - Yes. Some of our small TNT bombs will do. - Then get one ready at once. We must set up a booby trap in the shed. - Yes, sir. - Let's rig this light. (suspenseful music) (mask hissing) - Put them up. (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (water bubbling) (loud explosions) (questing music) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (water bubbling) - Looks like that blast got Martin, let's go. - [Bob] What happened down there? - [Larry] It must have been a booby trap. I fell in something and everything went black. - [Bob] Did you find anything down there? - No. If there's any other entrance, it's too well hidden to find. I'm sure the money is not there. We'll try to get a map of this mine from the former owner. If it shows any working back up here we'll do more investigating. - [Bob] Okay. But we probably scared them out of ever using this place again. - Calling Dr. Harding. Calling Dr. Harding. - Come in, Marex. - [Marex] Larry Martin has escaped our trap but he's left without discovering anything. - And you still have the money? - Yes. So you can make your arrangements to purchasing the uranium at once. In the mean time we must have the other materials for the nuclear reactor brought in from the island base. - Do you think it's safe to try that again so soon? - We must risk it. We have to have the bomb completed by the time the Earth is at that point in its orbit from which it can be most easily deflected out into space. - Very well. Do you want me to arrange for the use of the submarine again? - Yes, but try to find a better method of bringing the cargo ashore this time. The material you'll be handling is radioactive enough to cause considerable electrical disturbance. So get it into your lead safe as quickly as possible. - Yes, sir. Calling X71. Calling X71. - Having any trouble? - Not a bit. I just lowered the nets in the dire when the submarine put this stuff in. - Is this all of it? - No, I'll get the rest tomorrow night. - Okay. Help us get this stuff in the truck. - Just after one o'clock this morning there was violent interference with all radioactivity in this area, from the waterfront to the east side of town. It was undoubtedly caused by some highly radioactive material being moved to that area. This does not necessarily tie in with that gang you've been having trouble with. But it does indicate illegal traffic in some atomic material. - We know that gang's been working on some sort of atomic project. - Yes, and we know they've been trying to smuggle material to this country so it adds up. I'll fly over the harbor area with a radioactivity detector and try to locate the source of that interference. Help with the suit, Bob. - Fine. - Good luck, Larry. - Thanks. - Detector's in that drawer, Sue. (suspenseful music) - Calling Bob. Calling Bob. - Yes, Larry? - I picked up a strong reading right over the middle of the harbor. There are no ships anywhere near. - It's that submarine again. - That's my guess. So I want you to charter a speedboat, get an underwater detector and some small depth charges. - Right. I'll meet you here at the lab when you get back. (suspenseful music) Everything set for tonight. The gear will all be put in the boat by dark. - Good. - Can I go with you this time? - I'd rather have you patrol the waterfront area with a geiger counter in case they get the stuff ashore before we locate it. - Well all right. - Let's go. (suspenseful music) - Shall I hook up the detector now? - I'll do it on the way out. Let's go. (ominous music) (engine revving) - We're about there. I picked up something. It's moving. Change course to 165. - 165. - Submerge to 100 feet. - Aye aye, sir. - Reduce to quarter speed. - We're right over them. Hold her steady. (engine revving) (explosion) - Submerge another 100 feet! - Missed it. Here goes another. (explosion) That got him! Let's go back and pick up, Sue. - Right. - What's she doing here? - She must have picked up that stuff on this geiger counter. Take her up there and tie her up. I'll make sure nobody else is around. (ominous music) - That's the last one. - Hey. Let's get out of sight. - Hey, what was that? - Let's take a look. - Hold it. Search them. (grunting) (loud splashing) (water bubbling) (questing music) (ominous music) (grunting) - It's some kind of electronic device with radioactive material in it. It's plenty hot. - We're gonna take it all apart and see if we can find any clue to the maker and what it's supposed to be used for. - Can you find any trace of the rest of the cargo? - No, it's disappeared completely. But if they try to move it again we'll be ready for them. I have men with geiger counters planted on all the main highways. If anything radioactive is moved out of town we'll pick it up. - That's a sensible plan. You know that guy is using atomic material, so you have a good chance of getting on that trail. - Check with you later. - So all the equipment is safe in my vault except of course the drum which was left on the dock. Larry Martin is sure to have picked it up by now. - That is very serious loss and will be difficult to replace. But in the mean time we can go into the other phases on our project. Have you arranged to get a supply of uranium? - I've arrangements to Roth to take the place of the guard on a truck load of uranium leaving the chemical warehouse this afternoon. He'll manage to have Shane with him. - Good. Once we get that uranium we can go into the final stages on construction of the bomb. - Stay here. I'll signal you when it's clear. - Okay. - I'm your new guard. Sorry I didn't get here in time to check the load. - Well it looks okay to me, but you can give it a quick count. - All right. You can go ahead and get changed and wander. (engine revving) (suspenseful music) - This is a stick up. Pull over. Get out and start walking. (engine revving) - Good. We'll get right after it. Our spotters picked up a radioactive truck heading east on Highway 40 just out of Kelson. Bob, take your car and get on that highway. - Right. - Sue, you stay here. And both of you keep your radios open. I'll let you know if I need help. (ominous music) Calling Bob and Sue. Calling Bob and Sue. - [Bob] Yes, Larry? - [Sue] Come in, Larry. - I picked up a hot reaction from a truck going east on Highway 40 almost to the foot of the pass. Where are you, Bob? - Just a few miles behind it. - Then catch up with us as soon as you can. I'm going to board the truck. I'll leave my radio open so you can both hear what happens. - Okay. - Right. (suspenseful music) - Stay where you are. Hey, Roth. Larry Martin just landed in here. - Watch him close. I'll come back and help you. (suspenseful music) - What do we do with him? - [Roth] Tie him up. We wait till we get to the vault, we'll call the boss for orders. (suspenseful music) (engine revving) Hey Shane. This roadster back there looks like he's tailing us. Take a look. - Okay. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (tires screeching) (loud explosion) You can relax now, Roth. I stopped him. - Good. There ought to be a phone both at that gas station ahead. I'll make a call. He says to use Martin to get into his lab then we can grab that electronic gadget they got from us. - Good idea. - (whispering) Did you hear that, Sue? - Yes. - [Larry] There's a revolver in the second drawer of my desk. Can you use it? - Of course. I'll be ready. - Just walk right on in. Don't make any brakes. There's two guns behind you. (ominous music) Stay here till we see it's okay. Go on. (gun firing) Keep him covered. Here's what we want. (grunting) (electricity buzzing) (questing music) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (glass breaking) (electricity buzzing) Now that fixes him. Get that instrument and let's go. (suspenseful music) - Larry, I thought they'd killed you. - Have they gone? - Yes. - The metal in my suit must have ground a part of the charge. - And they took that electronic device with them. - Is that the last of it? - That's it. - You take it and continue your work. I'm going to Dr. Harding. - Yes, sir. (suspenseful music) So now we have everything we need to complete the H-bomb except the detonator which is still on the island. - That's radioactive too, isn't it? - Of course, why? - It's obvious that Larry Martin has been tracing our recent shipments with radioactive detectors. By now he undoubtedly has a screen which will be very difficult to penetrate. - Yes, you're right. It would be too risky to move it through town. We'll have to use the spaceship. - That isn't safe either as long as Martin's rocket's in business. - [Marex] Then we'll eliminate it. - That won't be easy. It's always guarded. - We can bomb it tomorrow and rocket before it has time to take off. Can you secure some aerial bombs? - Yes, I have several experimental ones here. A new type, small but very powerful. - Then the only problem is getting them to the rocket ship. - I've arranged for a foreign submarine to pick up one of my atomic power units in the east end of the bay tomorrow. I can have them take the bombs to your island base. - Good. We must create those bombs and haul them out of here at once. Then arrange for a boat for tomorrow. - Okay, but you wanna get rid of that truck. It's sure hot now. - Very well. Arrange to get another one. But take the old one away from here. - Okay. - Go to town and pick up another truck. I'll meet you out in the canyon, we'll transfer this stuff and we'll leave the old truck there. - Right. - I've marked all the points where we picked up radioactivity readings on all the trucks. They all follow the same general route. - Yes, all the trails end up in the est side of town. - That's not much help. They took long to search all the buildings in that area. - Sure, but that truck is easy to spot from here. And if it's still anywhere around there I'll pick it up. - You better wait till I catch to you before you tackle them again. - I'm not going to try to capture them this time. I'm going to try to work it so they'd give me lead to their headquarters. This is a portable radio transmitter, the kind they use on life rafts. It puts out a constant signal, one that can be picked up in a directional receiver anywhere within 100 miles. If I find that truck I'll plant this transmitter on it. You stay here until I get back then we'll start using the small receiver. (suspenseful music) (alarm beeping) (suspenseful music) - Hey, there's Martin. (guns firing) - Hey, if he hits one of these bombs. - Yeah, you're right. Get the engine started, I'll keep him covered. (guns firing) 2:02:44 (engine revving) - I was glad they ran for it. - I'm just hoping they take that truck to the headquarters so we can nail the whole gang. - The direction the signal is coming in strong. The truck's due west of here now. - Stand by the radio, Sue, we'll keep you posted. Let's go. (suspenseful music) Take the next turn right. Looks like we're heading for the water front. - Hey! What's this? - It's a radio signal transmitter. No wonder Martin let us get away so easy. He's tailing us. - Take the truck and get going, anywhere to lead him away from here, I'll handle the boat. (suspenseful music) - The signal was almost at maximum but it's fading now. - They must have stopped for a while and started up again. - Could be. We'll have to turn-- - Hey! That looks like one of them now. (engine revving) (gun firing) - There's another boat. - Let's take it. (suspenseful music) (guns firing) - Put me alongside it. (suspenseful music) (loud explosion) (questing music) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (loud explosion) - I just can't understand it. Why would anyone be taking bombs to a submarine? - I can't answer that. Up until now they've only been interested in getting hold of material for some kind of atomic project. - Are you sure of that? - Reasonably so. Everything we caught them with have been of atomic nature. Let's recap a bit. First there was the shipment of uranium on the freight train. As you know they captured the train. - Larry! - Isn't that Bob on top of that freight car? - Yes, when we got here those men were stealing the train. Bob jumped on it and tried to stop them. - Any way to stop that train? - No, my key's out. They must have cut the wire after the slugged me. - There's the brake, can you fix it? - I can fix it but it'll take time. - Maybe I can catch them in the car. - Not much chance. The road only gets near the tracks in a few places. - Is that old tank working? - Yes, we just unloaded it for some farmer who's gonna make a tractor out of it. - Maybe I can cut across country and stop that train. - You better try. If it keeps going you'll crash it through the passenger train head on. (engine revving) (train chugging) - Tie him to that brake wheel. Use those. (engine revving) - Isn't there any place to stop the passenger train? - There's one if I can only call in time. I've almost got this fixed. - About time we stop and unload this stuff, isn't it? How'd that get on our trail? - I don't know but they've got on us somehow. - We're not gonna have much luck unloading the car of uranium with that thing chasing us. - Yeah, we better forget it. Let's make our getaway while we can. (suspenseful music) (train chugging) - It's too late. The passenger train's already gone through the junction. Only one more chance now. If I can raise Gomez Sighting they can derail the freight there. (train chugging) (suspenseful music) - You'd better jump. (loud explosion) Then there was that electronic apparatus which could also be used for atomic work. - You mean that equipment they brought in the rocket? - Yes. They landed it in the mountains and brought it down the Lincoln Boats. I located their dock. - Hey. There's somebody snooping around our stuff. (gun firing) (engine revving) - Yes, you're right. All the evidence points to some illegal atomic projects. But we still... (phone ringing) - Larry Martin's office. For you, Mr. Steele. - Yes? Very well I'll be right over. Some officials from Washington are waiting for me in my office. We'll continue this discussion at a later time. - All right. In the mean time we'll keep trying to find out what they're doing. - Good bye. - Larry Martin is sure to intercept our rocket if we try to bring it in. - But we must. We have to get that detonator from the island to complete our hydrogen bomb. Martin's rocket must be destroyed. - It'll be a tough job, it's well guarded. - That ray gun you developed, would one of its shells penetrate the hull of Martin's rocket? - Yes, it would go through the hull and burst inside. - The that's our answer. When martin takes off to intercept our rocket he will have to fly over Eagle Peak. You and Shane set the gas gun up there, blast him when he comes over. - Okay, when will your rocket be coming through? - As soon as you get the canon set up I'll radio them to start. - Okay. (suspenseful music) - What's up now, Larry? - That mysterious rocket is headed this way again. I've ordered Dick to take off my ship and I'll fly aboard it. - Be careful. (suspenseful music) (alarm beeping) - How are you doing, Dick? - Everything's fine. What's the course? - Hold her as she goes. I'll see if I can pick up something in radar. - All right. (suspenseful music) - Let 'em have it. - What's that? - It's fire bomb. Or gas! (suspenseful music) (questing music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) - How are you doing, Dick? - Everything's fine. - Let them have it. - What's that? - It's fire bomb. Or gas! (gas hissing) (gas hissing) - I still don't know what hit us. - It was a gas shell. But we'll be all right if we keep these helmets on until it clears out. - Here it comes. (rocket groaning) - [Man] Central Communications calling Larry Martin. - This is Larry Martin, come in. - The unidentified aircraft has gone off our radar screen. - Did it land? - We can't tell. It was a long way out when it disappeared. - All right, we'll return to base. That's it, Dick, let's head back. - Right. (suspenseful music) - Here's the detonator. Elah said he'd stay in the rocket. - Is the rocket well hidden? - Yes, we covered it branches. Nobody can spot it from the air. - Good. Nothing can stop us now. It'll only take a few hours to attach this detonator then we can all take off for Mars. - Are you sure the rocket can carry all of us and your men from the island too? - Oh yes. Now get Dr. Harding. He's going to help me make the final adjustments on the bomb. - Okay. (suspenseful music) - It's putting out a strong transmission wave. - But that means it's televising a picture of this room right to its control board. - Which is exactly what we want. My indicator will keep me on the beam and I'll fly right along at the gang's headquarters. - If they have their receivers on they'd be waiting for you with a warm welcome. - That's a chance we'll have to take. Stand by the radio, I'll keep you posted. (suspenseful music) Calling Bob. Calling Bob. - Yes, Larry? - [Larry] I'm at the end of the beam and it's Dr. Harding's house. - What, you mean Dr. Harding is one of that gang? - It looks like it. The robot control panel is certainly in his house but it'll take some strong evidence to convict a man like Dr. Harding. - Finding the control panel at his house ought to be enough. - Not unless we prove his panel actually controls the robot. So load that robot in the car and bring it out here as fast as you can. I'm going inside now but I'll keep my radio open so that you'll know what's going on. - Right. (suspenseful music) - I'll be ready in a minute. (suspenseful music) - What are these men doing here, Dr. Harding? - They're trying to steal some of my designs. They forced me to put them in this briefcase. - Turn around. Stay where you are. I came to investigate your robot control panel, Dr. Harding. (glass breaking) - Good work, Doc. Let's get out of here. Got any diving gear? You'll need to go in through that water tunnel. - [Dr. Harding] Yes, in that cabinet, there are two of them there. (ominous music) - What happened? - They knocked me out. Did you hear anything after that? - Yeah, just before they left they were talking about taking some diving gear to go through the underwater tunnel. - Then there is a tunnel out of that shaft in the cave? - There must be, we better get out there-- - Wait a minute. You've got the robot in the car. We've got the control panel here. We'll take it along and let the robot do the fighting for us as well. Hey, we'll take that diving gear too. (suspenseful music) Stop just before you get in the cave and we'll set up the control panel. - Right. - Better stand guard outside until we finish. - Okay. - All set? There he goes. (ominous music) (gun firing) (gun firing) - We sure got them on the run. (gun firing) (ominous music) (screaming) (screaming) - That's that. We'll leave the robot there and try that underwater tunnel. - Let's get the diving gear. - Turn on the air. - [Bob] We couldn't find anything down there the last time. - [Larry] Maybe I didn't look close enough. There may be some kind of a concealed door. - It's Larry Martin. (scuba hissing) (water bubbling) - Take care of them. (water bubbling) (ominous music) (questing music) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (clock ticking) There, everything's completed. The bomb will explode in two hours. By that time we'll be well on our way to Mars. (water bubbling) - What did you find down there? - [Larry] There's a shaft to the back end of that tunnel. Somebody came down and cut the air hose. They must have a hideout in there. - What can we do about it? - We can keep them in there until we get help. Go out in the car and radio Mr. Steele to send some troops with underwater gear. - We're trapped. - No we're not. Where are those gas bombs? - They're right over there, sir. - Get them. - We'll saturate that cave with gas. It won't hurt us and this diving gear will protect you. - No, no we can't risk it. We might be delayed too long. - We have no other choice. - We do. We can shut off that bomb and give ourselves up. - Do you think I'm going to abandon our whole project just when we're on the verge of success? - My life means to more to me than your project. I'll shut off that bomb myself! (gun firing) (suspenseful music) - It'll be another hour before they get here. - Well, all we can do is wait. (suspenseful music) (coughing) (gun firing) (gun firing) - Get the car started. (gun firing) (coughing) - Maybe we can catch them. - I better fly after them. - Prepare to take off at once. - Yes, sir. (suspenseful music) (rocket hissing) - Calling Sue. Calling Sue. - Come in, Larry. - That rocket just took off in the mountains back at Lake Emerald. Tell Dick to take off with my rocket at once. I'll board it in the air. - Right. Calling the rocket, Larry Martin's rocket. (rocket hissing) - How are you, Larry? Where do we go now? - Just hold her as she goes until I pick up that rocket on radar. - Right. (rocket hissing) (dramatic music) - There he is. - [Dick] Firing Ray Gun. (explosion) - That did it, he's going down. - Swell. Are we following? - That's rough country to land in. I'll fly down. You take this ship back to the field. - [Dick] Yes, sir. (electricity buzzing) (electricity buzzing) (dramatic music) How about the others? - I think they're all dead. - You're in pretty bad shape yourself. Take it easy and I'll call for an ambulance. - No! First you must stop the bomb. - What bomb? - The back cave through the water tunnel. It'll blow up soon destroy the whole world. - How can I get in there? - Turn the right knob at the left wall. Just ahead of the trap door. Hurry! (suspenseful music) (alarm beeping) (suspenseful music) (clock ticking) - That zombie has a fair chance of recovery but he's still too weak to talk. - Then we'll have to wait before we find out what this is all about. - Not entirely. The papers we found in Harding's laboratory explain why they're building the hydrogen bomb. Its explosion was intended to deflect the rotation of the Earth enough to send it out of its orbit and spinning off into space. - Those zombies must have been as crazy as they looked. - It may sound ridiculous but it's theoretically possible. - It's certainly lucky you managed to stop them in time. - Yeah, we're safe now for the time being. But there are undoubtedly more of those power mad creatures loose in other planets, so it'll take constant vigilance on our part to ensure the safety of this world. (questing music)
