My dear Svetlana! How are you? How is my Kiev? Yes, I am free... but I don't feel safe here, in Tbilisi. I cannot live without work. I'm illegal. Neighbours sometimes give food to me. Only you, our son and my friends mean the world to me. If only you could come for Christmas! There will be plenty of tangerines... Waiting for you so much. Yours truly, Sergei. Tie it up! And now - like Bette Davis... Who's that? KYIV, UKRAINE, 1958 Like this - Botticelli's Venus... Wait, no! Romy Schneider! And who's Botticelli's Venus? Brilliant! Let's drink from the joyous chalice. Where beauty flowers... Let the fleeting hour To pleasure's intoxication yield. She's beautiful... She's miserable... Cheers! I've realized... a harp would really suit you. What? You could sit in an elegant pose and pluck the strings. Like this! Serge, you're crazy. Harps are very expensive. Quiet! Quiet! Money is not a problem. They've given me a commission, can you believe it? Super! Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors. This is a unique material! I'll make a brilliant film. Of course you will! Paradjanov... You're magnificent. But unbearable. Dima! Dima! So, where is the yoke? CARPATHIANS, UKRAINE, 1963 Here, got the yoke. But it's not in the script. What's it for? We are filming a wedding. We need a yoke because according to a Hutsul tradition, the bride and groom are harnessed with a yoke on their wedding day... ...as a symbol of hardships of the young couple. Well, folks, how does that sound? Plausible enough? - Really, Petro? - Yes, maybe. Yes, it could! Let's go! I don't like it. Change the frame! Put the camera down, please! Dima! Open the chest, please. Hang the scarves, - two! - Like that? Yes, it's OK! Young man, may I? - Is that OK? - Yes! Dima! Like that! Dear friends! Please, one more time, please? Music! Ivan, take a bow! Good! And now, miss, cover his eyes with the towel. Bring him my way... Go, go, here, sit down! Boys, bring in the yoke! Ivan, turn your head a bit... Let's film! Get ready! All ready? Start! Ready! - Camera! - Yes! Action! Very good, Ivan. Stop! Cut! I'm not filming any more of this nonsense. What? You heard me. Find yourself another cameraman. Go to hell! - Stop, please! - Anyone can run around with a camera... You call this running around? Genius wannabe! I could kill you, just give me a weapon! A duel? Wanna shoot me? There are a lot of pistols here - load and shoot. Fearless, my ass! I'll shoot you tomorrow, then. Right here. At dawn. At six. Don't be late! Don't shit yourself tomorrow morning! Clown! Shooting is finished for the day. Tomorrow we are filming "Ivan's Death". Go! My songs, what can I do with you? Can I sow you, my songs, in the mountains? You, my songs, will sing with the mountains, While I'll cry away my tears. And this is the song that the river echoed. And who composed that song? It was Ivan's girl, Marychka. Well, granny, lovely song, isn't it? It is. She is beautiful. Your wife? Used to be... Don't be sad. You'll be together... Trust me! Come and eat porridge with sheep's cheese. Coming, granny. Thank you, my dear. My songs, what can I do with you? Can I sow you, my songs, in the mountains? So good! Eat, dear. Good evening! Antique axes. Like them? - And what is it? - A pistol... I'll buy it. Where's the other one? I took the other to Ilya. He's already tried it out. He blew a pumpkin to smithereens... So he hasn't calmed down. God is my witness, I didn't want this... You should cock it. Don't you try to teach the teacher, kid... Wake me up tomorrow at 6.30 a.m., okay? No problem, chief. You'll be my second! - Me? - Well? Yes or no? Yes... Am I dead? Let's go, Chief! We'll be late! The duel? Duel? Are you being serious? The dailies are here! They are waiting for you at the club! I'll go and fetch Ilya! You should get up, OK? Let's go, let's go. Let's enjoy some beauty before we die. Well, it's his turn now. He has all the time in the world to kill me now, might as well do it an hour later. Garbage, is it? Either I don't get a thing, or you are a genius. You are the genius. No, you are! I'm going, but you do not be late, OK? PREMIERE OF Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors She isn't coming. She isn't. Go, I'll be there in a minute. Fine! We're about to start the screening. Come on... Let's go! I congratulate you on the premiere. You are gorgeous. I should be congratulating you. I'm pleased that you watched the film through to the end. And they wanted me to dub it into Russian. Which I love very much. But then, everything would have been lost. Everything... The soul of Ukraine, which I finally understood. That's what I told you. I understand that not everyone likes the film, but we were honest with ourselves and the art! Comrades! Friends! Listen to me! Right now the Ukrainian intelligentsia, writers, poets are being arrested in Kyiv, in Lviv. Sergei, who is that? He's insane! You came, even if this is a dream... You came... Rise to show your protest! Sveta! - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon! Thank you! - May I come in? - Yes, come in. Hello! Please! Here's the thing, Miss. Svetlana... I wrote you a glowing reference, but... it was sent back. From where? From the... Well, you know... The thing is, we wanted to send you and the two of your colleagues to Cube, for two years... Oh, my! But... Do forgive me, I'm being asked... about the nature of your relationship with your ex-husband, if you are seeing each other... Of course we see each other, we have a son together. Well, they don't seem to like your meetings very much... They hint that you should write that you don't see him because you don't share his views and his actions. And then... Excuse me, but I need to go to the kindergarten to pick up my son. Hello! To the health of the man of the moment, Sergei! Oh, who's here! Handsome! This is Arseny. An architect. He's wanted to meet you for a long time. His father is a big Communist Party boss. So think before you speak. Here, meet Ahmed and Lucy! Music! I was just talking about the Communist Party. They didn't let me go to the Film Festival in Mar-del-Plata. And I made the best Ukrainian film ever. What sort of nationalist am I? I am just a genius! Send me to Africa and I'll make the best African film ever! How about making the best Armenian film? - Good question... - Think about it, while I'm a director there. Pretty boy! Will you put a word in for me to your father? Just joking! I'd love my son to become an architect. Come, I want to show you something. Come on, aren't you an Armenian? I am an Armenian, born in Georgia, accused of being a Ukrainian nationalist. Make way! Here comes the bourgeois Ukrainian nationalist! Shut up, would you... This belonged to Prince of Ukraine. What century is that? - The Seventeenth... - Correct, well done. - It's for you! - Thanks! Take good care of it. Not a word to your father. Come, I'll introduce you to my flatmate. He's studying to become a film director. Macedonian! Alexander. Nice to meet you! Dear friends! - I'm not a dissident. - Of course not! I am an artist. My only desire is to make films filled with beauty. Maybe I am clinically ill with love for beauty, like those who search for pearls or dig for gold? Maybe there is such a disease. Let's drink to the beauty! - Think about my offer! - Sure, sure! Everybody is free to do whatever they want under the covers! For example, I am happy... That's right, I'm happy... ...that I'm not a sexologist when I listen to the music of Tchaikovsky or when I admire the works of Leonardo or Michelangelo. And what does it matter whom they loved and how? Think all you like, but do you have to yell about it? - What shall we do with him? - To love! Hold on, I'll take your picture! Very good! Thank you! What did they talk about? You can't really pick on anything in particular. Only about beauty, love for art, sexual preferences... UKRAINIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE OFFICE and cinema. - Anything else? - He gave everyone presents. A load of old rubbish. There was someone new there; ...he gave him a candlestick, and said that it was from the 17th century. I asked Dima about this and he told me that this was a prop. What did you say about sexual preferences? Well, to be honest, I didn't quite get it. He did say that in such a great country anyone can do whatever he wants with his own... bottom. Something to that extent. Know what, Sasha? Carry on like this. You're very talented at taking photos... I'll put in a word for you at your university. You'll get a job in Kyiv. Thank you. I really appreciate it. As they say, nothing but the truth. You are free to go. COMMITTEE FOR STATE SECURITY OF UKRAINE Comrade! My duty demands that I write to you about Sergei Paradjanov. He has turned his house into a den. I request that you bring these debauched acts to an end. Yours faithfully. Signature. No name. What can you say about this, Citizen Krasnova? I've not heard anything about this before, and if I did, I wouldn't believe it. I introduced Arseny to Paradjanov. Only the most respectable people came to Paradjanov: architects, sculptors, film directors. I don't believe that he might have forced somebody... That's nonsense... Comrades Soldiers and Sailors, Sergeants and Captains. Comrades Officers and Generals. I congratulate you on the International Workers Day. Hello! Hello! What are you doing here, spent the night? Why? I'm just paying a visit. I moved away from here. I've got my own apartment now. - Where is he? - Went to the shop. Will be back soon. I won't wait for him. I'll just take my books. OK! This is a surprise for Maestro - he'll like it. - Take care, I'm off to the demonstration. - Goodbye! I'm home... Did you buy any sausages? The potatoes are almost ready. Look how pretty it is! But these aren't sausages... But it's so beautiful! Alexander Gusev lived at his place. Sergei did help him with entering the Institute of Cinematography. He helped out a lot of students. I'm listening. Go on! He never made any strange propositions to me... Good! What "exceptional" valuables? They're all in his imagination and fooling around. The signet ring from the Head of the Armenian Church? Please! Sergei has had that signet ring for many years and the pale-blue stone, surrounded by small glass pieces? He bought it from a mutual acquaintance of ours for 45 rubles... Well, that's basically it... I cant go on living like this. But why? Your film is a global success. And that's exactly why they won't allow me to work here. They won't even read my scripts. Rejected, again and again... After all this, I am a beggar! To hell with this! I'll go live in Armenia, they invited me. There is my motherland, they've approved my screenplay for Sayat-Nova there. Farewell, Mother Ukraine! What about me? Hi, dad! What's with all the conspiracy? Why not talk at home? Not in front of your mother... - Did you have a quarrel? - No... Well? It's a very difficult topic for me, son... Did something happen? You see, this concerns your friendship with this... you know, this Paradjanov. He is being tailed, and this can affect you as well. As your father, I beg you, stop seeing him. Why? I saw the pictures... He kisses you, and embraces you. So what? Arseny! I beg you, leave him be! YEREVAN, ARMENIA, 1966 This is the tenth time I'm saying this! Authentic style... No props, ...no imitations. Just real antique rugs, gold dishes, truly antique facial features. This, this is what I need! Not your tin bowls and jugs out of foil. Gold leaf! - What gold? But the budget... - Everyone's against me! No gold-- you're done with this production! In the screenplay the rugs are worn down by the heels of Kurdish women. I need real Kurdish heels. You get real Kurdish heels - we schedule the filming. If not, I'm going back to Kiev! You should not defend her! I know what I'm saying! Gayane Akopovna! Meet Sergei Paradjanov. - The Paradjanov? - Yes. - Nice to meet you! - Gayane! Your damn artistic council did not approve my actress... Come, I'll tell you something! These are real heroes and patriots of cinema! Go drink some tea, guys! Come on, Melik, you too! OK! That's it. I'm leaving! Here, read it! Moscow. State Cinematography Committee of the USSR. - The scheduled shooting day... - ...is completely ruined. I insist on the closing of this film... ...with my subsequent leave from the film industry in general. I'm sick and tired of Tarkovsky's repression! Signed... "Paradjanov." The State Cinematography Committee won't understand. And besides, Sayat-Nova was an Armenian poet and she's a Georgian actress. She is Sayat-Nova! Suppose she's actually Armenian, by her twice-removed grandmother. Sounds good? Send this telegram to Moscow! Still, she's a woman, and Sayat-Nova was a man. Suppose she is a hermaphrodite! Who would have thought... So what if she is a hermaphrodite? At least she's a brilliant actress. By the way, she's also going to play the poet's beloved, a nun dressed in white lace, an angel of resurrection and be in the pantomime scene. Laertes, I'll bring fame to this God-forgotten studio, don't worry! Sayat-Nova, shot 17, take 12! Look only in the camera... It also says here that you are not only friends with Paradjanov, but also... You see, this is a personal question, and I don't really want to... Yes, I wouldn't want to either, but imagine if someone, besides your father, finds out about this... You realize this will be such a blow for him... Why does somebody have to know? Well, we think that's best. I wouldn't want that. Well, then, let's make a deal. Tell us about Paradjanov, the things he says, about who and what. I think I told you everything already... You did, but not everything. And now you ask us not to tell anyone... - I beg you. - And so do I. I'm trying to look after you. You do us a favour, we do you one. Go on... Do it quickly! That's it! Let's roll! What violence are you talking about... That's a dirty lie! Simply ridiculous. Well, look, you don't have to sign anything. I'm going to put this bastard away anyway, for as long as possible. He ought to get a year for this - I'll get him five. Why? This one, right? They want to look through all the material in Moscow. With rough sound. Why? I need time, I need to edit this! They want it all... All five hours? Fine, then. Fine with me! There! Watch it! Bastards! Panin. Speaking. Speaking. Arseny? What do you mean he slashed his wrists?! It can't be! You have no idea how bad it was... ...and so I told them: "Go to hell! This is my film. I'm not going to change it." I wrote to the Minister. - Citizen Paradjanov? - Of course I'm a citizen! You're under arrest. Come with us... HIGH SECURITY PRISON, UKRAINE, 1973 Everything is all right. How is our boy? He finished school. He went to the seaside with his grandmother... I feel terribly guilty. Poor boy. Change his surname. I lived so easily for 50 years. Loved, talked, admired... Got to know a lot and did next to nothing. I hated greyness. Grey is a fashionable colour here. Paradjanov, everything is going to be all right. - Yes... - You'll see! I was thrown here deliberately to be killed by inmates. I'm a joke, I don't know how to swear and don't have tattoos. I've been deprived of my role as an artist and as a man. Why would I want to get out? Let's get married again, here. It's allowed. You'd be able to visit me here with our son for three days at a time, instead of just one... They forced me to leave the university. Our son is applying to the Architecture University, just as you wanted. If he applies as the son of... "convict Paradjanov", then he won't have a chance. You know, I draw a lot in here. The visit is over. Say your goodbyes! Abroad, they have created a committee to support you. Fellini, Godard, Mastroianni, Yves Saint Laurent... They all have signed an appeal requesting your immediate release... They did... When you're feeling sad touch the carpet that I brought back from Armenia... There's warmth within it! That's me! Say your goodbyes... The hell?! The bitch has lost all his fear. Is he trying to make a laughing stock of you?! - Absolutely crazy! - Damn artist! Bring this filmmaker to me. Guys, bring him here! To become a genius you must spend at least two years in prison. Without this you can't become a great Soviet director. Wow... I must write Tarkovsky about this... What are you staring at, old man? Your hair is so lucky, guys! They're already free... Come on, move it. The Overlord is waiting. - He is a bloody lunatic! - Come on, move your ass! Down! Kislyak, let him be. What's up, old man? I don't really get it... are you a bitch or an inside man? You're here under the 121st, as a queer, but you don't look like one... This must be checked! You don't look like a filmmaker either... I don't believe you. But I did get a letter from outside, telling you had banged a commie. Respect... What shall I do with you? You'll be just like a political prisoner. Nobody's going to touch you. Picasso! I'm keeping this one. Draw some playing cards, with naked chicks as a New Year's present. Make sure they are cute! With big breasts! Get this shit out of here! Paradjanov, stop slacking off. The governor's waiting for you. The Committee has evaluated your request for conditional parole. Taking into account multiple rule violations and an irresponsible attitude towards your work, the Committee has decided as follows: your request for conditional parole has been denied. Paradjanov... Do you understand the decision of the Committee? I do... I'm being held hostage here. Be quiet! There's a telegram for you. Bad news. Your mother died in Tbilisi. Well, old man, you're back. We thought you were done for. They removed one of your lungs... It rotted completely. And I... I cut my finger off at the workshop. On purpose, so they won't make me work. I'll work at the church... Help the priest out. You know, the doctor was really worried about you. He's seen that movie of yours, about the forgotten ancestors. He confirmed you are a filmmaker. Listen, the Overlord told us to tell you there's word going around that you'll be out soon! Early release! You hear that, old man? Dear Svetlana! After the release from prison I am not allowed to live in Kyiv. Tomorrow, I'm flying to Tbilisi. I'll go to my parents' empty house. It's a shame I can't see you and our adult son soon. Take care of him... and yourself... Hello! Your passport, please. Let's see... Release Certificate... I see. Please pay 10 rubles in advance. Room 9, second floor. Hey! Mister! Room 9, second floor. No funny business, you know what I mean? TBILISI, GEORGIA, 1983 Hello! Hello! Listen, take my prison jacket as payment. Why would I need this ugly thing? I told you yesterday. - It's warm, though. - Give me a break! Matsoni, matsoni... Hello, dear friend! - When did you arrive? - Just now. I'm on a business trip, so I decided to visit you the first moment possible. We've got to talk... How are you? Good... Look! I have to finish my collage. I don't have a frame. It needs, you know, such a tender frame... Dumbfounded, Hamlet? Come on, let's go. Sit down! - Would you like some matsoni? - Who eats matsoni in the morning? How are you doing? How do you think I'm doing? I completely forgot! Put it aside! What is it? 500 rubles... After everything I saw in there, I can just walk up to a camera and shout "Action!" And anyway, I'm not thinking of making other films - it's a boring and alien art form to me. Sergei, you should move to Yerevan. - Where am I going to live? - My place. I've got a three-room apartment there; you can choose whichever room you want. I'll have a lot of visitors, you know that? That's fine, you can use the room as you like. Sergei, I've brought you something to eat... Hello, dear! Thank you, I'm not hungry. Damn you! He's not hungry... Where will I get the money? I'll take you on in Armenfilm. Get you a nice position. You'll earn 300 rubles. Listen up, Othello! Who's interested in Paradjanov, Part Two? No point in discussing my return. Especially if you've been slowly dying of diabetes, and there's nothing to look forward to but old age and impotence! Neighbours! The Armenians are offering me 300 rubles a month to move to Yerevan. And I need 300 rubles a day! Can you stop fooling around? I'm offering you this from the bottom of my heart. Go back to work. Are you crazy? In prison my life had some kind of meaning; It was reality that I had to overcome. My life today is absolutely pointless. Thank you, my dear! Now that's much better. Hold on! Dodo, dear, how are you? I'm well. And you? Fine, thank you. Hello! How are you? How is it in Yerevan? Stuffy! What's with all the noise! What do you want? I'm not well! I'm not here! Marcello came to Tbilisi... The...? Indeed, and he wants to meet Sergei tonight! Who is this Marcello? Never heard this name before. Don't want to see him. Screw him, I'm ill! Don't be so difficult. I've got enough problems. They did not give Marcello an Oscar, so he is in a really lousy mood. And the Minister's supposed to be here. Sergei, do you hear me? They did not give him an Oscar, you say? - Well, that changes things... - We'll be here by ten. I'm off, my genius... Come in from the yard! I told you to come in from the yard! Dodo, are you sure that everything will be all right? Let's see, come... Welcome. Make yourselves at home. I am Sergei Paradjanov. Please meet my old friend Laertes from Yerevan. When I was young, in search of a profitable career, I decided to enter the Institute of Cinematography and I've been starving ever since... That is me as a child... I was a bad pupil at school, I missed a lot of classes. We were raided at night all the time - my father was the most famous antiques dealer in Tbilisi, and my parents made me swallow... diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, rubies. And so I did... as the police were coming up the stairs. Paradjanov is a genius! In the morning, they would put me on the pot with a colander over it, and made me sit on it until the precious stones had worked their way out. Comrade Minister! That's Lenin's skull as a child, and now it's in his fifties... That's an exclusive collection. Paradjanov is a genius! This is my gorgeous wife, in comparison with whom I'm worthless, so she's not here. This is Kyiv with me, although it should better be without me from now on. I made the best Ukrainian film - and for that they put me in jail... They put me on trial saying that I seduced a communist with a pornographic pen... Much like this one. A gift for you! Thank you, Mr. Paradjanov! And what are you working on at the moment? Oh, never mind that... I've got a better story for you. About Italian art. Once, when I was in prison, I saw La Giaconda tattoo on one prisoner's back... When he raised his arms his skin stretched and La Giaconda smiled, when he bent over - she grimaced, and when he scratched his ear - she winked. She pulled faced all the time! Something like this. Paradjanov is a genius! What film is Mr. Paradjanov shooting at the moment? You know, he hasn't made anything in a long time... about 15 years. I don't know... We'll think about it. Here everyone needs a registration and a job. They won't give me a job. I can be arrested at any moment, because I don't work. Comrade Minister! May I have a quick word with you? Paradjanov is a genius! I'm about to get a commission. I want it to be given to Paradjanov. He'll make the best Georgian film ever. I can guarantee that! - Dodo! - Yes? You are a respected film director, a Party member. Even if you were to make this film as co-director, if it turns out well, all the credit will go to Paradjanov, but if it flops, you'll take all the heat. It is totally fine with me! You've got a commission. You stand over here... "8½" Stand there and wait for my signal... Manana... What's going on? Go to sleep already. How can you sleep when it's such a beautiful night in Tbilisi? You stupid woman! That's why you're so miserable: you've slept your whole life away! Genius, let me sleep. I have to work in the morning. Haven't you always wanted to see one particular man? - Suppose I have. - You have, haven't you?! Open your splendid eyes wide open, woman! Good night, signora Manana! Heads closer to the ground! Move your arms and legs! Move, move! Quick, quick. Stop. Good! Show me how to tell if it's gonna be a boy or a girl. Look, look. If you try it like this... Try it! Hands, and then... Like this! That's how they predict... Exactly like that! Shame on you! What is it? Where are the peacocks? Where are the camels? Tell me! What peacocks? What camels? Why do you need peacocks? To fuck them! Stop it! Look, everything is ready! Let's start shooting. - Everything's ready, isn't it? - Yes! Go on. Shoot, then. Where are you going? Could you say a word for our radio audience? Is it true that you've been invited to Paris with your film Legend of Suram Fortress? Felix! Turn on the mike! Distinguished film director Sergei Paradjanov is wrapping up the shooting of his film Legend of Suram Fortress... Where does it all come from? Why am I distinguished? He's the distinguished one! A distinguished idiot! You know I've just got out of prison? Have you got permission from the authorities to talk to me? I'm asking you, dear! This is national radio! What is wrong with you? Here's the deal! Unless I you get me nine peacocks and four camels, the shooting is over! This is just brilliant. I was right, absolutely right, to film this in Baku. Stop it! Dodo, God is my witness, I warned you. It's a flop. Trust me, this is the first sign that we have made a brilliant film! You wish. I swear on my mother's grave! Oh, you, my nightingale, Don't sing in the garden. Welcome to our house. Sing my son to sleep. But my son is still crying. Fly away, my nightingale. My son does not want to sleep anyway... PARIS, FRANCE, 1988 The Pompidou Centre pays tribute to a great filmmaker of our time whose contribution to cinematography is priceless. Who will receive the international recognition, here and now, in Paris for the first time! Please welcome to the stage... Mr. Sergei Paradjanov! Hello! I don't have any... official titles or honours. I am a nobody. I live in Tbilisi in my parents' house with a leaking roof... ...and when it rains I sleep under an umbrella and I'm happy. Yes, I'm happy. It's similar to the films of Fellini and Tarkovsky. For me, cinematography is the great mute. The fewer the words, the greater the elegance and beauty. Thank you! Sergei Paradjanov directed one more film, Ashik Kerib. It received dozens of awards at international film festivals all over the world. He died on the 21st of July 1990. He was buried in Armenia, in the Pantheon. Paradjanov Museum was founded in Yerevan, which would have been perfectly logical according to Maestro.
