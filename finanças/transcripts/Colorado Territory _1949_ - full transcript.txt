Yes, madam? I'd like to see my nephew, please, Wesley McQueen. Sorry, no visitors. Governor's orders. But this is his birthday. I baked him a cake. I've come all the way from Kansas just to see him. His, uh, uncle Pluthner sent him the prayer book. I knitted him the socks. We'll see that he gets them, madam. I wanted to tell Wesley about his folks and about the farm. And, oh, about his horse. The one he used to ride when he was a little boy. You tell him his uncle Pluthner has broken him to a buggy now. And he takes good care of him. Yes, ma'am. We'll tell him about his horse. Thank you, thank you. It's a white horse. A white horse. Tell him we pray for him to be set free. He's innocent, you know. Just a mischievous boy. He never really done anybody any wrong. Never done anybody any wrong. Only held up four banks. And the Missouri and Pacific Railroad. Twice. Like she says, mischievous. Hank, cut into that cake. Nothing in it. Eat a piece. Mm, not bad. Try a piece. No, thanks. It might be poisoned. Here, take the big innocent rattlesnake his goodies. Happy birthday, McQueen. Some presents from your aunt. Don't you want to hear what she had to say? I'm listening. She said to tell you that the white horse you used to ride when you was a kid is now pulling your uncle Pluthner's buggy. See you off to Leavenworth in the morning. McQueen is not gonna like getting up this early. Well, he can catch up on his sleep on the way to Leavenworth. Sound the alarm. Get a posse together fast. Where the heck did he get this? On the end of this, I imagine. But how'd he get that? On the end of this. But how did he get that...? Don't tell me. I know. And the dear old lady knitted them herself. You Pluthner? That's right. Pinkerton man, ain't you? I used to be, but I resigned. The old man must think a lot of you. Since when's he been hooking up with gumshoes? Don't worry, I'm all right. I handle things for him at this end. He's out in the Colorado Territory. Oh, here's your route and some money. He wants to see you as quick as you can get there. I owe him that. You owe him more than that. Cost him a pile of cash to bust you out. He's got a big job set up for you. - A chance to get rich. - I've been rich. When I couldn't get a breath of fresh air or feel the ground under my feet. Yeah? Well, don't get any ideas you're through with us. You wouldn't last long cut off from the herd, McQueen. They'll brand you clean to the bone. - Hello, mister. - Howdy. Who lives here now? The Martins. Used to be the McQueen's place. You heard of Wes McQueen? Pa says they're fixing to hang him over in Missouri. Who's your pa? Our name's Turner. Tommy Turner? How's your sister? Martha? She's gone. Where? Look at that, Julie Ann. You can see all the way into the middle of next week. It's a new world we're going into, that's what it is. The start of a new life. Saying it won't make it so, Pa. Great day in the morning! Well, sir, you had quite a snooze, didn't you? My name is Winslow. Fred Winslow. This is my daughter, Julie Ann. Your name, sir? Uh, Rogers. Chet Rogers. You new to this country, Mr. Rogers? It's a promised land, sir, that's what it is. My father used to say, "The sun travels west and so does opportunity." My daughter and I, we've left the past behind us. Yes, sir, we, uh, had a little farm back in Georgia. But then, uh, soil was beat out, crops poor, prices bad. So we sold out everything we had, lock, stock and barrel. That is, everything except our household goods. And we freighted them out ahead of us. They're waiting for us now at Medicine Hat. Mr. Rogers isn't interested in our personal history, Pa. Huh. My daughter's still a wee might homesick, sir. But she'll be all right once she sees the place waiting for us out here. I used to live on a farm. That right? My people were farmers. I've been thinking I might get a place out here myself. Wait till you see our place, sir. We bought it from some agents back in Georgia. Plenty of fine water. Best soil in the Territory, corral for 50 horses. Five hundred head of the finest, slickest cattle you ever laid your eyes on. Now, what more can a man ask? Hey, wait a minute. Get down. Get down on the floor. Get down, honey. Get down like the man says. Please, Lord, carry your sinful children safely through the journey and take us across the river Jordan. Lord, give that young man strength and guidance. And, please, Lord, forgive me for praying with my hat on. I... Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy! One hour for dinner. One hour for dinner. Where's Charlie and Bill? They had an accident. Most stupendous thing you saw in your life. Six hold-up men, and this gentleman took them on single-handed and saved us. The guard got most of them before they got him and the driver. - Did they get the money box? - Safe and sound. Right up there. Hey, Marshal, mister you can tell them what happened. Marshal got a tip this outlaw, Wes McQueen, is headed for the Territory. Marshal, the stage was held up. Charlie and Bill were killed. Here's the gentleman who brought it in. Meet, uh... What'd you say your name was? Chet Rogers. You was on the stage? On it? Mister, he saved it. He took on six bandits single-handed. Six! And he killed 'em all. I thought the Day of Judgment had come. I... Look at that. Look at that bullet hole. If that stagecoach had bounced up instead of down, that hole would have been right through my head. Oh! The guard got three of them. I got two. The other one got away. Can you describe him? Oh, big fella. About 6'4", I'd say. Long hair. Too bad you missed him. That sounds like Wes McQueen. You'd have been $5000 richer. Looks like I had an expensive morning. Where'd he jump you? About 8 miles back, right after we left the canyon. Come on. I wanna thank you, Mr. Rogers, for what you did. You're a brave man. And if ever you find yourself up around our way, The Rancho Del Sol, we'd be mighty glad to see you. Wouldn't we, Julie Ann? You'll be most welcome. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, sir. Mister, the way I figure it, you got quite a reward coming from Wells Fargo. Just leave your name and address and our superintendant'll get in touch with you. Thanks, but I'll settle for a good horse and saddle. You got 'em, mister. Howdy. Howdy. What do they call this place? You're in the Canyon of Death, mister. - What's that up there? - That? That's the City of the Moon. Leastways, that's what the Injuns call it. A dead city hanging in space. How far to Todos Santos? Oh, that's way north of here. Sits in the mountains. Over the top of that ridge. You ain't headed for there, are you? Why not? I'll tell you about Todos Santos, mister. Strictly the back end of nothing. The Spaniards moved in first. Injuns come along and massacred 'em. Then the pox come along and took care of the Injuns. Left nothing but scorpions and Gila monsters. Then an earthquake come along and took care of them. Ain't nobody gone there since, mister. Less'n some rattlesnake maybe got himself lost. Well, I ain't lost. Who are you? I'll do the asking. That's McQueen, all right. It sure fits the old man's picture of him. Glad you got here, McQueen. We're in old Dave's setup with you. I'm Duke Harris. This is Reno Blake. Where's the old man? He stays in Potrero. How far is that? About 60 miles. What do you think of the hideout? Looks all right. It is all right. I picked it. Reno's an expert on hideouts. Who's boss here? A debatable issue. Do you mean physically or intellectually? I'll talk to you. The great Wes McQueen. Just a big Kansas jay. Reno and I are quartered in that broken-down hacienda. The girl has a room upstairs. Anything else with a roof on it? Well, we reserved the old Indian kiva for you if you're not bothered by ghosts. The tribal council chamber, Mr. McQueen. Gathering place of the medicine men, the seats of the mighty. No longer occupied. You talk kind of fancy. Only philosophizing, Mr. McQueen, on my favorite subject: Doom. When it's got you marked, you're already dead. What's the girl doing here? You don't have to worry about her. - Why not? - She's stupid, McQueen. She thinks loyalty a virtue. Reno met her in an El Paso dance hall. There was a bit of shooting. He cleared out to save his hide and he took her with him. For some obscure reason she's grateful. Where do you two fit in with the old man? A large payroll is the bond that unites us. It travels by the Denver Rio Grande up to Potrero. A Mr. Wallace, the railroad conductor, will tell us the next date of shipment. So the details of execution are in your hands. Is Wallace in touch with the old man? He'll be up to talk to you on his day off. I'll do my own talking to the old man. That's all. I take it I'm dismissed. And get that girl out of here. There are two of you and one of her, savvy? To be accurate, Mr. McQueen, there are now three of us and one of her. Yes, sir. Pickings must be awful easy back in Kansas, a big jay like McQueen can get a reputation. I didn't see you tangling with him. What're you looking for, a punch in the nose? Well, what'd the big noise have to say? Very little. Colorado, you can start packing. What's eating you? McQueen's orders. This is to be a bachelor club from now on. Why, that overgrown jailbird. He's not boss around here any more than I am. - He can't come in... - Keep it up, Reno. You may talk yourself into winning this argument yet. You getting tired of living, Duke? Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! Instead of fighting with each other, why don't you go over and tangle with him? Yeah. Trouble is we might need him for this job. A rather obvious point. Well, give my regards to the girls in El Paso. I ain't there yet. I'd like to talk to you, Mr. McQueen. Help yourself. Duke tells me I have to pull out. That's right. What if I tell you I don't want to go? I'm telling you, you do. But I don't wanna go back to El Paso. Why not? I've been there. Look, I don't care where you go. I don't want you around here, see? Maybe you think I know too much. Maybe you're afraid I'll talk. Maybe. Well, if I was you, I'd do my worrying about Wallace. The conductor? He's the gabby one. Besides, there's nobody up here to talk to. I should think this is where you'd want me to be. Look, I ain't so worried about you, it's those two sage rats you're tied up with. Next thing you know, they'll be throwing lead over you. I can handle them. You're pretty sure of yourself. That's right. Can I stay? You in love with this fella Reno? No. Then what's the big attraction? I like it here. Look, I'm not hiding out, if that's what you're thinking. You ought to understand. You don't wanna go back to jail. Well, I don't wanna go back to the dance hall. That's right. I didn't like jail, but I did something about it. I busted out. Maybe that's what I'm doing. All right, we'll give it a couple of days, see how it works out. Thanks, Mr. McQueen. Thanks. Don't worry about your horse. I'll feed him and water him. What happened between you and McQueen? Why'd he let you stay? Maybe he likes the way she combs her hair. Yeah, maybe he does. She never piled a plate like that for you, Reno. Leave that there. If he wants to eat, he can come in and get it. You want more? Yeah. Get it. You're losing your grip, Reno. She's looking for trouble. So are you. Want some breakfast? Oh, I was wondering about that. We don't serve fancy, but it's hot. I was trying to figure you out last night. Didn't keep you awake, did it? Nothing keeps me awake, Miss, uh... By the way, what is your name? Colorado. Colorado Carson. Colorado. You born in these mountains? My mother. She was part Pueblo. I guess she was homesick when she named me. And your old man? Boss cowhand down on the Pecos country. Grew up there. Pretty tough place for a kid. It was all right as long as Pa was living. After that, it was either the Comanches or the cowpokes. I don't know which was worse. You know, "Let's go look at the moon." That was on clear nights. Rainy weather it was, "Let's go inside the barn and pitch a little hay." You probably play that game yourself. So? After Ma died, I headed out for San Antone. Got myself a job in a Wild West show, shooting glass balls with a rifle. Riding broncs. Broke my leg twice. Looks pretty straight to me. Straight enough to get myself a job dancing the honky tonk. Then the owner decided I ought to sing. That's when the shooting started. Next stop, El Paso. Anything else you wanna know? No. I think I understand. Just so you get one thing straight. It wasn't Reno brought me here. Maybe it's these mountains. Maybe there's more of my mother in me than I thought. That's the train conductor. Well, if it isn't old Denver and Rio Grande himself. Yeah, and it's too bad they don't run a train up here, because I'm no horseman. And after that long ride... Ooh. I'm gonna stick to railroading. Sit down and rest yourself. Long haul back to Aztec and no short cuts. On your way home don't run into any mountain goats. They're liable to bite you. McQueen, this is our contact man, Homer Wallace. Well, it sure is a pleasure, Mr. McQueen. Do you mind if I call you Wes? What's your play, Wallace? Huh? Oh. Well, uh, I... I unlocked the baggage car for you. Well, you got a gun on me, of course, what can I do? I can't do nothing except act scared... You are scared, ain't you? Huh? Huh? W-who me? Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. McQueen, I never threw in on anything like this before. I'm a respectable man. Well, you can ask anybody in the town of Aztec. That's the junction. Yeah, I live there, me and my wife. Well, everybody knows me. I'm a family man and a lodge man and... Gabby old buck, isn't he? You've seen the old man? Uh, I... I saw him just yesterday. He wants to have a talk with you. I wanna have a talk with him too. Well, he's waiting for you. Here, uh... Here's his address in Potrero. He wants you to ride the train in and kind of size things up on the way. I'm sizing things up right now. Huh? Reminds me of a little hoist we'd planned in West Kansas about five, six years ago. One fellow was smooth, slippery. The other was green and gabby. The third was just plain mean from the top of his head to his boot heels. Next thing we knew there was a boxcar of soldiers coupled onto that train. Too bad we never knew which one sent word to the soldiers. Been better for the other two if we had. Their monuments are right outside of Barksville, Kansas. Prettiest little bone orchard you ever see. Little stone angels watching over them. Well, I, uh, guess I better be going. Take care of yourselves. You too. You sure scared the pants off him. I'll ride that train into Potrero tomorrow. Hello, Mr. Rogers. Evening, Miss Julie Ann. This Indian woman is looking for water for her sheep. Yeah, don't seem to be much water hereabouts. Then you've seen our ranch. Rancho Del Sol, a new life, adventure. Opportunity travels with the sun, remember? I kind of thought your Pa was expecting too much. Where's the 500 head of cattle? Five hundred? Less than a dozen. Walking around like dead things. Pa sent them ranging to find water. Barely enough here for the horses. He packed off before sunup to try digging a new well. Your Pa's got a lot of gizzard. You're lucky to be his daughter. I guess he's lucky too. I try hard. Well, Mr. Rogers. Doggone, if I ain't, whoa, glad to see you. You're sure a sight for sore eyes. How you getting along? Well, you... You can see for yourself, sir. I'm just a hunk of bait thrown to the sharks. The, uh, land sharks, that is. And I sure got gobbled up. In me you will see a shorn lamb, with nothing left to offer you but his bleat, but you're welcome to that. You got stung, all right. Yeah. My boy, never buy a foot of land more than 5 miles from home. And not then till you've seen it, felt it, tasted it and smelt it. At that, you might get bamboozled. I wish we could go right back home. Julie Ann, we can't go right back home. You know that. Not a red cent left, Mr. Rogers. No brains, just chasing a pot of gold. You expect to dig a well with those tools? With them things, I couldn't dig a hole in a swamp. But then a man's gotta use the tools he can lay his hands on. Yeah, don't worry, Mr. Winslow, you'll make out. Yeah, Julie Ann, Chet's staying for supper. Oh, no, I'm just on my way to the railroad. I can't stay. I got a little business in Potrero. Well, let it wait. Take tomorrow's train. We'd be pleased if you'd stay. - Yeah. - I'll get supper. Julie Ann's a mighty fine cook too. Did you ever think you'd like to travel a long way off? As far and as high as the moon? Stay there for good and ever. Forget all about things down here? There's been plenty of times I wanted to get away from where I was. That far away? Yeah, that far. You never talk about yourself. I don't know anything about you at all. There's nothing to tell. Like you said: Wanting to get far off from what you been. This is far off. I thought we were getting a fine house, good land. I thought maybe in a year or so I could take a trip back home. Maybe ride the train this time. With fresh money in your purse. How did you know? I had the same idea myself once. Might work out yet, Julie Ann. How fast can this thing go? I can push her to 25 miles. Man, that's sure rolling along. Mister, what are you doing in there? Looking for a place to sit down. Ain't there any seats on this train? Plenty of them up in the passenger coach. Oh. That rube'll get his pockets picked before he gets to the junction. Board! Aboard! What's the fare to Potrero? Uh, $1.80. What's the next stop? Well, there's a flag station at Pine Flats. Look, if you wanna know... That's all. The old man inside? Yes, in there. He's sick. Wes McQueen, you old buffalo. That call sure took me back a long way. Glad to see you, Dave. You're looking good. You're a liar. I know what I look like. What's wrong with you? Everything. Can't eat, can't sleep. Doc says I'm paying for past sins. Have a drink, Wes. You supposed to have that stuff? Oh, why not? All gotta die sometime. Me, you, the whole cockeyed world. Doesn't make much difference what kills us. How about the job I got set up? Looks good, huh? Dave, the reason I came here was to thank you for busting me out. Oh, forget it. Sorry I couldn't have got you out sooner. You like the deal you're gonna pull? The deal's all right, Dave, but it's me, I... All the time I put in down there got me to thinking. About what, Wes? I'm through with the game, Dave. I'm quitting. I wish I was a young buck. I'd do the job myself. I can't hardly get out of this blasted chair. I'd like to pull it for you, Dave, but I've been figuring on settling down. Getting a farm someplace. You ride this one, you can buy 20 farms. Aw, don't let me down, Wes. I'm just about clean. Spent a lot of money this last six months. Busting me out, huh? Oh, you'd do the same for me. But I counted on this. Set me up for life. Well, I guess one more won't hurt. Aw, sure it wouldn't, Wes. You'll pitch in, won't you? I'll ride with you, Dave. Sure scared the liver out of me. You meant what you said about being broke? There's the kitty, Wes. Two thousand dollars. Take any part you want. I'll take half. You can have it back out of my end. All right. A thousand for you and a thousand for me. Thanks, Dave. I'll head straight here with the swag. Anything happens to me, you know where to find the wife back in Joplin. See she gets my cut. You'll be all right. Nothing's gonna happen to you, you old coonhound. Sort of making you my executor, ain't I? Well, I wouldn't want to leave it up to Reno or Duke. What rat hole did you raid to find that pair? Friends of Pluthner. He'd sell you out for a nickel cigar. Oh, no, you're wrong there, Wes. Once a gum boots, always a gum boots. Now, don't you worry about Pluthner. He's the one hombre we can count on. You both got it straight? We need McQueen for the heist. Keep him fat for it. Soon as it's through, so is he. Well, even Reno can understand that. I been saving one for that big jay. I'll let him have it right on schedule. Hm, not from the front. But not from too far back. If you miss, McQueen don't serve no second helpings. I won't miss. I'll drink to that. You show up at Rickard's house with the haul, we make it a three-way divvy. What about Rickard? What about him? He can't reach for a gun or stand on his legs. Come in, come in. Well, hello, Chet. I'm glad to see you. It sure was nice of you to drop back. - Give me your hat. - No, I can't stay a minute. I got a long ride before dark. Well, have you had something to eat? - Yeah, sure. - Hello, Chet. I brought you something. What is it? Go ahead, open it. Oh, Chet, you shouldn't be spending your money that way, to bring us presents. We... We... Pa. Look at her, boy. Look at her. You put the light of life into her face. Oh, it's beautiful. I hope it fits. We'll soon find out. I'll only be a minute. Now, sit down, Chet. Sit down. That dress sure must have cost a heap of money. I got lucky in Potrero. Fell onto a poker game. Here's $900. More than you'll need for well digging. Nine hundred... No, I... No, it's... I don't know what to say. No, it's no use. I... I can't take it, Chet. Why not? Because I know why you brought it. It's on account of Julie Ann. I know, I know, but it's all on account of her. You see, there's a little matter that you don't know about. About Julie Ann? Yeah. I got to be honest with you, boy. There's a fella back home, name of Randolph. Randolph sells the bell cows back there. Martha's in love with him, is that it? Martha? I meant Julie Ann. Well, I don't know. She still writes to him. They figure on getting married? No. Randolphs don't marry with river bottom folks. You got to live it to understand it, boy. That's why you brought her out here. You can't blame her, boy. She's not bad, she's just... Just young, that's all. She sure did want to live up in that Randolph mansion, way up there on the bluff. You know, a girl gets crazy ideas sometimes. Anyway, I... I sure thank you for the offer. I'm not giving the money to her. I'm giving it to you. You like her, don't you? Why don't you tell her so? Maybe you could get that Randolph fella out of her head. She likes you too. Yes, she does. Well, look at her, look at her. She's as cute as a bug's ear. It fits perfect. Yeah. Thank you. Oh, I'll unsaddle your horse. You're gonna stay to supper, aren't you? No, no. I... I can't stay. I'll be coming back, though. We'd always be glad to see you, Chet. Remember you said I never talked much about myself? Good reason why. I got another life to get done with, once and for all. It won't take but a few days. Then I'll be back. We'll be here, Chet. Thank you, Julie Ann. Goodbye, Mr. Winslow. Goodbye, son, goodbye. You will come again right soon, won't you? Remember what I said that day back in the stagecoach? The Promised Land, I said. And I was right too. You won't find a man like Chet Rogers back home. Is that you, Wes? What's going on? What happened? Reno. He went crazy. Got to drinking with Duke. You know how Duke is. He likes to hurt people. Took it out on me. Well, I couldn't stand it no longer. I threw a bottle at him. Yeah. Reno wasn't any help. He said I'd been looking for trouble ever since you came here. I thought you said you could handle them. They went crazy, I tell you. Reno hit me, then waded in on Duke. I ran over here and locked myself in. Where are they now? Out by the church somewhere. Reno didn't have his gun on. Duke did. Reno had to take to the dark. Duke is hunting him out like a rabbit. You stay here. Let them alone, Wes. Let them kill each other. Come on out, Reno. Come on, move. Who do you think you're bulling around? Move, I said. Colorado, come here. You two had fun mussing her up, huh? Self-defense, McQueen. You slapped her around. She had it coming to her. You stinking rats. Here, work them over. Oh, what's the use? You don't get off that easy. Don't, Wes. It don't matter. Now, wait a minute, McQueen. We gotta start pulling together. The heist comes off Friday. Who told you? Some crony of the old man's. All right. Turn in. I'll give you the layout in the morning. Get out of line again, I'll kill both of you. Get your bed roll and bring it in here tonight. Where'd they get the bottle? Pluthner brought it. Pluthner? That's what they called him. He's the big scissor-bill that brought the message about the payroll. You know him? Yeah. I know him. Martha. Martha. Martha. Wait. Don't go. Don't go. Where d'you go? I'm getting out of Todos Santos. Come on back here. Who's Martha? Martha? You was dreaming out loud. Must have been. Are you in love with her? We was gonna get married. What stopped you? She's dead. It wouldn't have done no good. What do you mean? Marrying her wouldn't have helped none. You bust out of jails maybe, or mud holes like I was in, but you can't bust out of what you are. You can if you're set on it. Can you? Me. Hm. I was born under a chuck wagon. Never got much higher. Anything was a step up. Even getting hit by Reno was all velvet. He won't do that again. He had a right to. He knew Duke was right when he said it was you I wanted. Hold me, Wes. Hold me. It won't work. I've got plans. There's no room in them for you. Not for the long pull. Maybe there won't be no long pull. Maybe it all ends Friday on that train. Yeah. Yeah, that's where it ends. Everybody takes his own road after that. Reno. Duke. Rickard. You and me. We're all through then. There's the railroad. There's a good stand of trees at Pine Flats you can hide out in until I signal you to board the train. Colorado, if we make this haul, you're in on it. Right? There's a small bridge at Luckman's Pass. You wait there with the extra horses. That gives you just about four minutes to get that safe open. It'll be open. I only hope those train guards give us an argument. If there's anything I hate, it's railroaders. Don't be getting a trigger itch. I don't want any funerals on this picnic. Did, uh, Pluthner have anything else to say? Pluthner? You forgot to mention him, didn't you? You know, the bird that brought you that whiskey yesterday. Oh. Was that his name? I just knew he was a friend of the old man's. Nice, private hideout you picked. Ain't supposed to be anybody around here. Welcome. I'm glad to see this old bell has a small voice after all. A sky pilot, uh? I am Brother Tomas. Year in and year out, I travel the trail of the missions, keeping the chapels in order. Stopping often to ring the poor, old broken bell of Todos Santos. Not that it can be heard very far. Well, that's good. The ways of the Lord are strange and wondrous. In the... In the foundry at Aztec there is a bell cast of bronze. Its tone is clear, its call will carry far. Ha! For 10 years it has lain there. Aztec's not far away. It is not a matter of distance, child, but of money. When we receive enough offerings to pay for it, then it will hang high and sound its call. Perhaps, then, the Indians will come back. We will even rebuild the mission of Todos Santos. Oh. Thanks be to the travelers who dropped this offering here. Nothing is too small. I didn't know it was there. I'm quite sure you didn't. Nothing is too small. Time to be riding. Good luck, Wes. Do you travel far? Far enough. May God be with you. Vaya con Dios. Mrs. Wallace? Yeah? Is your husband at home? No, he's down at the train, about ready to take her out. Oh, I guess I'm too late for that job I was hoping to get. What job? Guarding the payroll shipment. I figured they might need some more guards. They ain't short. The marshal himself's riding the train. Homer had four of his deputies in for poker last night. He think that's enough? More than enough, if you ask me. The hold-upper they're expecting is only priced at 10,000. I told Homer he'd be sorry he took them other fellers in on it. Just makes less for him. You're right, ma'am, you're right. Don't forget, Marshal, I'm the one that tipped you off. The big end of the reward money's mine. You'll get it. All right. Get aboard. Board! Board! There's a flag stop at Pine Flats. Maybe he'll get on there. Maybe Pine Flats. Wallace! Good heavens above. One more double shuffle, you're dead meat. Call those two guards out here. Tell them the marshal wants to see them. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Dan. Johnny. The, uh, marshal wants you. Heist them. Get rid of their guns, Wallace. Yes, sir. Now jump. Jump! Get over on this other platform. Oh, yes, sir! All right. Now, pull that coupling pin. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Your wife seemed awful interested in that reward money. My wife? Maybe if she don't skin you alive for not bringing it home, I'll drop in and take care of you. McQueen's outfoxed us. He's run off with the baggage car, tortured the guards and massacred the engine boys. Blood's a-running down the track. Don't go out there. This is the smoothest run we ever made, friend. We're breezing along like a race horse. When I fire them, ha, they snort. Keep it snorting. Straight ahead and don't look back. And don't stop until I tell you. All right. Get it open. I'll go up in front and cover the engine crew. I always did want an engineer's watch. What for? They're never on time. This wax is as hard as your head. Ah, those cracks are sealed good enough. Give me the chisel. This'll put us right back on the plush. You still got McQueen to take care of. Yeah. Now, what are you waiting for? Now's your chance while he's up there covering the engine crew. Trouble is, he might not have his back turned. Yeah, I knew you never had the guts to shoot it out with him. I could cut this car loose, leave him up there. Reno, you do have a brain. With this car loose, it'll take a mile for the engine to stop. That'd leave McQueen stranded where the marshal could pot him easy. Go pull the pin. The big country boy's on his way. The only thing he'll get is the engineer's watch. Gimme that fuse. Well, don't blow yourself through the roof. Say, did you look on top of this car? What for? He might have doubled back on you. Don't judge his brain by yours. I knew he wasn't up there. Now, we'll deal Pluthner out. Let old man Rickard die in the poorhouse. Yeah. Give your girl back to the Indians. Heist 'em! Keep 'em up. You and Pluthner had everything rigged pretty, didn't you? On your feet. Here. Put these on. Now, hook them to him. No, to his shank. Now, get over there. Come on. Get on your feet. We can't. We're shackled. Wallace! Yeah. Here's the other two. Yes, sir. Mr. Duke Harris and Reno Blake. They're guilty. They're guilty. Look, marshal. You don't want us. We're small potatoes. McQueen's the one with the price on him and he's got the haul. Yeah. Make it easy on us, we will tell you where to grab him. Go ahead. He's headed... Headed for old Dave Rickard's house, just outside of Potrero. Wes, don't go in. Those Indians singing mean trouble. Robbing the dead, huh? You didn't expect me? No. I, uh... Well, sure I expected you, Wes. Don't look at me like that. I know what you're thinking, but it ain't true. Old Dave died natural. Well, you got the stuff? Was there any trouble? A little. The marshal picked up Reno and Duke. What? Aw, that was a tough break. They were good boys. But that's the game for you. All a part of the game. You and me, Wes. Just you and me left out of that fine parcel of men. Of course, we end up with the money, you and me. But that's how the cards fall. Look, Pluthner, this deck's had so much bottom dealing it's dog-eared. Too many jokers turned up. The bank ain't cashing. You took your divvy out of the old man's poke. The game's over, gumshoes. Put your hands up and turn around. Just keep looking in the mirror. You'll see a coyote that just done himself out of 50,000. Wes, what happened? Pluthner. He got me in the shoulder. It's like I said. I ain't never seen Wes McQueen. Come on, let's cut up through the Canyon Del Sol. That's, uh... That's $765 for the well digging. That leaves us over a $100 for winter feed. Thanks to Chet Rogers. I'll be needing some of that money, Pa. Hm? I'm leaving here, Pa. You're what? I got a letter from Carter Randolph today. He wants me to come back. Does he say anything in his letter about getting married? No. And I don't care if that's the way it's gotta be. - I'm going to him. - Not by a jug full, you ain't. If I can't go one way I'll go another. But I'll get there. You won't get... Who's there? It's me, Mr. Winslow. Well, what's the matter, son? What's happened to you, Chet? There was a shooting in town. He got a slug in the shoulder. It was an accident. It was no accident. And my name's not Chet Rogers. I held up the Denver and Rio Grande. I'm Wes McQueen. You don't have to take me in. Sit down, son. Colorado, this is Mr. Winslow and his daughter, Julie Ann. Let's have a look. The bullet's in there, all right. We ought to have a doctor. He's got one. Get me a sharp knife. I got my veterinary kit. Well, get it. And boil some water. Right away. Colorado, you better hide those horses. I told you I had a past to get done with. I never figured it would end like this. I had it all figured different. There's 100,000 in those bags. I figured with a stake we could start a brand-new life, go anyplace you wanted. You can't go anyplace. Not now. You've got to get well. You mean it don't make any difference I'm Wes McQueen? I knew it. I knew I could count on you, Julie Ann. Who's that girl? Colorado? She's all right. She was in on the holdup. Tomorrow she gets her share and goes her own way. We'll put him in my room, Pa. He'll be more comfortable. Here. You got it out. Go ahead. You know what to do. Give me the powder from one of those bullets. Where are you going? Well, I'm not gonna let him lie there and die. He's got to have a doctor. I'm riding into Aztec. You're gonna stay right where you're at. Nobody's leaving the house. You do like she says, Julie Ann. If he ain't better come morning, I'll hitch up a team and drive to Aztec myself. Hey, you, in there. It's the marshal. Then I'll be right out, marshal. Just as soon as I get my britches on. Oh, I rousted you out of the feathers. Blessed little sleep a man get around here. First a fella comes riding through hob-leather, bleeding like a stuck leech. He's the one we're after. Say... Say, ain't... Ain't you the one, that we saw on the stage holdup? Yeah. I thought I recognized you. Well, you're sure playing in hard luck, mister. Two chances you've had at Wes McQueen. Wes McQueen? That's right. Which way was he heading? He was heading north like he had an antelope by the tail. It's too bad you didn't know who he was. You'd have been $20,000 richer. The railroad's offered a reward too. Get out of my way. If you hear anything, get word to us in Aztec. Let me go! Talk and I'll pull your tongue out. Here. What's going on here? Take her off me. Quit that. Quit that. Hold her here, and I'll catch up with the marshal. We'll be rich, Pa. Twenty thousand dollars. We can leave this horrible place. You heard what the mars... Shut up. Come on, Colorado, we're leaving. You thought we was your friends. I wish you could have gone without knowing different. You've been a good friend, Mr. Winslow. Good luck, Wes. What did Martha look like? The girl you were dreaming about that night. Well, she was pretty, all right. Tall and willowy, turned-up nose that wrinkled when she laughed. She had dimples too. That's Julie Ann. That's funny at that. All the time I was planning to marry Julie Ann, I knew it didn't make sense, but there was something about her. Just Martha's ghost, I guess. How'd you figure it out? I'm a woman. Duke Harris, Reno Blake, hung by order of district judge. You see that the Territorial governor gets that. And tell him the crows will be pecking at McQueen too before another 48 hours. Curley, Jack, Grey Eyes, come here. You ride out to Indian Springs, he might head up there. Seeing that he's wounded, he'll need water. You take your men and head down south end to the Canyon of Death. McQueen might take off for Mexico. Grey Eyes, you take a look around Todos Santos. And now, remember, you men, if you flush him, don't try to shoot it out with him. He's quicker than a black-headed snake. Just send up a smoke signal and we'll spot it. Yeah, it's a nice sight for anybody with a train-robbing itch. What is it, Wes? We're going to get married. Wes. I bought this ring for... Maybe you wouldn't wanna wear it. I wouldn't care. Oh, don't put it on now. It's bad luck before you're married. Who's afraid? You won't be sorry, Wes. I'll make you love me. Maybe I did all along. Maybe that's why I let you stay here. Maybe I had the real thing alongside of me all the time and didn't even know it. You're sure you're not a little blind? I knew what I wanted. Wes McQueen. You don't aim very high. I'll see if that Padre is around. Oh, children, I'm so happy to see you back at Todos Santos. We want you to marry us. But I'm not a priest. I'm only a brother. I have no authority to perform such ceremonies. But... But you yourself told me once that Aztec is not far away. It is for us. We don't wanna turn back. Then go forward, my children. Follow the trail over the pass, beyond the Canyon of Death. It will lead you to Old Mexico. There at Rosario is our mission. A beautiful church. See Father Esteban about getting married, huh? And, uh, when you're happily married, pray sometimes for Todos Santos. That it too may live again. - Thank you. - Bless you. We'll hide out here for a couple of days, and then... Then where, Wes? Old Mexico. Do you think you'd like it there? I like it just hearing you talk about it. We'll be safe there. I'll send the old man's widow her share and then we'll get a place all our own. What kind of place, Wes? You could hold your head up as good as anybody married to a farmer, couldn't you? Whatever you wanna be. It's what I want you to be. As good as anybody. This time, Wes, we can really bust out. We're in the clear now. We just head out over those mountains... What is it, Wes? What does it mean? It means we're a couple of fools in a dead village dreaming about something that will probably never happen. Wes. What are you doing? Fixing it so you can't follow me. Bury the money, Colorado. I don't want you caught with it. Hyah! I'm going with you. What do you wanna do? Stay with me and get killed? We got to split up till this blows over. They'll take you. They'll never take me. I've seen all the jails I'll ever see. This time it'd mean the rope. It's our only chance, Colorado. I'll head over the pass to Old Mexico. I'll wait there for you, I promise. We'll meet at Rosario, do all the things we talked about. Goodbye, Colorado. Wes. Good scouting, Grey Eyes. You catch where he's running? He take trail through pass to Mexico. That's how we figured it. Fan out and we'll corral him in the Canyon of Death. First man spots him, give the signal, three shots. Then we'll tighten the cinch on him. He start for City of Moon. No way out. Move it. There's only one way up there and he's got it right under his guns. Hey, McQueen! You got no chance! Come on down! We don't want no shooting! Come and get me. We'll starve you out! Go ahead. I wonder if he's out of ammunition. Let's see. Eagle. I don't know. Do you think you could work your way up there to the top of that rim? I never heard tell of nobody ever doing it. Well, we'll take a try at it, anyway. If we can get him to show himself, we can take a shot at him. What are you doing here? Who are you? I'm... I'm Wes McQueen's woman. We got him trapped up there. You the marshal? I know where the money is. You'll never find it. Not unless I tell you. Come here to bargain, huh? Let him go and you can have it all. Now, you've got to understand it's the law you're talking to. It don't make bargains. Then you won't get him. Well, I might be willing to go a little ways with you. You get your man to come down here and we won't shoot. What would you do? Hang him instead? I'm offering you the money instead of Wes. McQueen. Come down. We got your woman here. That's what you say. He won't fall for that. Start yelling, you. Go on, or I'll cut you up. Go ahead. I won't call him out. If he's gotta die, he'd want it this way. Take it easy. All right, if that's the way you want it, let him die up there. You don't wanna leave him up there. Buzzards picking his bones clean. Call him out and we'll split the 20,000 reward with you. Long time ago, my people live here. Me know way in City of Moon. Go around mountain. Come in back way on other side. How far? Long way. Ride horses. Curley and Jack, you stay here and watch her. We'll go around and get him. Well, he wouldn't let us in the front door so we'll go around the back door and get him. You made it sound so good I almost believed it myself, Grey Eyes. Do you think she'll call him out? Maybe so. Anyway, Eagle's got the daylight for his target. Now, if Curley and Jack do just like I told them, this might work. Get them up. Both of you. Higher! You. Go over there and fetch me those two horses. Keep your hands up. Both of you. Now, start walking and don't look back. Wes! - Wes! - Colorado. Wes, they're coming at you. They found a back way. Come down, Wes! Hurry, Wes! I got horses! Don't. Don't! Brother Tomas, who has brought this new life to Todos Santos? A happy couple who passed this way.
