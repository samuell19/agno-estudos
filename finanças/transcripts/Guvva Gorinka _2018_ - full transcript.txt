GUVVA GORINKA [birds chirping] Birds are used to represent love. Because birds have unlimited freedom in the nature Be it birds or humans, only when they love each other, they'd live in pairs. [temple bell ringing] [playing voilin] She is Sireesha. Music is her world. She secured a post graduation admission in her favourite course of studying voilin. On the contrary, her father decided to get her married. But Sireesha promised her father that she'd get married after completing her favourite course and started to Hyderabad from Annavaram. He is Sadhanand. He is pursuing PhD in mechanical engineering. There is no bike or a car which he didn't use for his experiment. [honking] [tools clank] For even a small sound, he reacts as if it is an earthquake. Making noiseless engine is his life-ambition. When he goes out, the first thing he needs is to have cotton in his ears and the second one is silence. This is a lovestory of a guy with misophonia and audiophile girl. Despite having differences in what they like, they'd manage to pair together like a dove and a myna. Hi. Hi. -Hey Siri... -Hi! How are you? How come you've become so skinny? -How are your parents? -They're doing good. Give me the bag. Not this bag. Give me that one. -Let it be. -Just give. -Take it easy. -Tsk! Siri, I have to tell you something. You know my boyfriend Arya, right? Hmm... We're in a live-in relationship. In a live-in relationship? Come on! Living together before marriage and knowing each other. Understanding each other. It is to ensure that we don't get into problems post marriage. -This is to have a better life. -What do you mean? -What do you want? -Are you perfect for each other? Of course, dear. Very much. Siri... He is my boyfriend... Ah! Arya! Oh no! -Here is the tea. -Thank you. Harika, didn't you say that you'd be going to the office? -Get ready. I'll drop you. -Hmm... Okay. See, how compatible he is! Where'd you get a guy who takes care of everything from handing coffee to dropping me in office? Oh no! Arya! Come. This is... Uff! Arya! What's with your bathroom and bedroom? Do you know how you kept those rooms? I'm getting delayed to office. Is it? Is it just you who is getting late to office? What about me? Tsk! Siri, cook whatever you want or place an order. Okay, I'll manage. Go. Hey, what are you doing? Packing. Seems like you have forgotten about the perfume? Perfume bottle? Oh! Alright, get me out of these. What were you doing inside till this time? Well, when shall we buy a perfume bottle? Hmm... Fifth. -Fifth? -Huh! -Stay like this till then. -What the... Oye! Are you kidding or what? Baby... Look, don't behave like my ex-girlfriend. Can't you wait for ten days? I bought all these, right? It's just one item, right? Wait, I'll buy it as well. All I asked is just 10 days. Just this time. Please. Can't you wait? -Hey... [door opens] -We'll meet after 10 days. [door shuts] Hey! You should be given a poison, not a perfume. Bloody girl! [groans] Stupid janitor faced girl! Thank God! She didn't take away my shorts. [Telangana folk song playing in the background] Oh Goddess! Ensure that I get less vehicles with more repair work. It'll be wonderful! "You have embarked on a tiger, Oh Goddess Durga" "You have embarked on a tiger, Oh Goddess Durga" Hey! -Yes. -Is your song even related to the Puja? Well, idiot... Mastan Bhai called me yesterday and complained that you have fixed the puncture of the front tyre when he asked for the rear ones. He was intoxicated and was whining over the phone. What can I do, bro? By the time I went inside and got the tool-box, he has parked the vehicle in the reversed manner. I didn't mind which it is and fixed the puncture. You fool! [pants] Look, the chain-guy is here! -Which girl did lock you this time? -Hey doctor! Remove these shackles, please. What do you think? Do you think this is a police station to come here wearing shackles? This is my garage! Hey quarter bottle, is it a joke to you when I'm giving you work? Just remove them. -Raju...-Yes. Get the hammer and other tools, and cut his thing. Who the hell is this selfie-maniac? Hey fool, mind your work. -Well, what has to be cut? Sorry, bro. Cut his thing. Cut his shackles. You should be clear like this. Hey... Hey... Are you a fool or a mechanic? He is a puncture man. Giving him a hammer is a terrible idea. Hey, he is very professional. He is... Hey... Who is your owner, him or me? Just cut it. -Look, customer is king... Listen... -Customer, my foot! Just cut it. [phone ringing] Damn! Please take out the phone. I wonder who calls me at this time! Put it at the ear. -[phone ringing] Come on, talk. -Who would connect the call, your father? You should tell everything clearly! -Hello girl, tell me. -Just give it to him, idiot! -Hey baby, what's up? -Hey idiot! Won't you change? Huh? Yeah, sure! -I have booked a seat at Green Bawarchi. -Won't you change at all? How can you still flirt with girls when you are still in shackles? We'll try something different. It is not you, but your phone has to be... -...slammed to boulder. Hey! Hey doctor! You can scold me but never say a word about my phone. Understand? What do you know about the phone? Huh! Google, Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram and the entire world is in it. Well, that's not the case. Dating is not needed if you have data. Do you know it? Huh! Hey baloney! Let me tell a few words about your cell phone. Listen. -Come on, start. -Come on, start the beats. You are unable to hold your horses, aren't you? [percussions] "It would play with you by distancing your closed ones" "This is the effect of Android!" "It would twist your words and turns you mad," "after you get into that" "You got stuck on Facebook and your life revolves around YouTube" "You got pushed into the Whatsapp and tied up by Twitter" "And your life got locked with Like, Share and Comments" "Boom... Boom... Boom..." "Boom... Boom... Boom... Social media is your doom" "It's been worsening your animus by making you cross the limit of entertainment" "What's with the annoyance of yours?" "What do you think Social media is" "The entire world would be in your pocket" "Hmph! He won't change" "Come on! Calm down" "Though you have no face value, put a tweet to Modi" "Shower your talent and trap the daughter of Trump" "If you are updated on daily basis, you are the cyber-king" "After the advent of social media, other media got dwindled" "Hey... Shut up, dimwit" "There is a lot more of reality. I'll narrate and you listen to it" "It made your ignore your parents" "It made your desert your wife and children" "It trapped you into it by making you indulge in stupid conversations" "and proved you as an incapable person" "You used to be a respectable person and it made you hang your head in shame" "Boom... Boom... Boom..." "Boom... Boom... Boom... The cell phones brought your doom" "It's been worsening your animus by making you cross the limit of entertainment" "What's Aadi? Why have you been clicking like that?" "Bro, I have received a message" "It states that forwarding it to 10 people would fetch me good luck" "You fool" "All the fools gathered at one place!" "Shut it" "Someone says forwarding a message to multiple people would fetch you salvation" "Someone says clicking a URL would fetch you good luck" "They'd just annoy us by posting moral stories and quotes" "They'd keep forwarding poor jokes and ordinary matters" "The cell phone would ring in the early morning like a rooster" "It consumes all your free time. Internet is its fuel" "The world would be online with their brains in the offline" "Boom... Boom... Boom..." "Boom... Boom... Boom... The cell phones brought your doom" "It's been worsening your animus by making you cross the limit of entertainment" "Boom... Boom... Boom... Social media is your doom" "Boom... Boom... Boom... It's been spelling doom" Hey, where are you taking me? Srinivas, I have seen your thesis. -There are minor correction. -This is a new style. If you correct it, the project can be approved. Bloody life! These idiots came after us. He has completed his PhD. He did... And this guy as well. When will we complete? As usual. Not 'as usual.' It is 'age use well.' -Hell! -Bloody blockhead! -Lower your voice, dude. -Why should I? Will he make us sit for two years more? He'll anyway do that. Bloody thief! What I feel is that the negative effect of Saturn would relieve us after seven years. But if we still stick with him, we'll become senior citizens. -Mad fool! -Hey, please leave me. -If you have any doubts, come to me. -Hey! Come here. Which year? First-year. He has no brain but he has fixed strongly on the concept. Actually, he is more intelligent than you. Wait and watch, he'll get the PhD before us. -You'll get the PhD in the first year. -Thank you, senior. Go... Go... Go... All of you, listen to me attentively. Did you get a PhD? Hey, my topic is 'women and their travel with the machines.' I've been roaming and staying in your house, so I became spoiled like this. I'm approving your thesis. In unison: Son of a pig! Sure, sir. Bloody thief! Superb! [playing voilin] Is this our house? Why are you taking this burden? My girlfriend and I have been busy and messy. You saw us in the morning, right? Hmm... No problem. I should at least make you tea for doing all this. I'll have tea only after Harika comes home. Shouldn't you at least drink tea in Harika's absence? Here it is. Thank you. Umm... Nice! Is this your first visit to Hyderabad? I've actually visited earlier. But this is my first time to come here to stay. Wow! Why have you arranged everything in the house? Now, both of us would face some difficulty in finding things. Hmph! When have you started drinking tea? What do you mean? He is the one who prepared it. He never served me a cup of tea till date. You don't like to have tea, right? Did you serve me anytime? The only reason I didn't serve is that you don't drink tea. You should do some things without any reason as well. In the same way, search a house for me to live without asking for reasons. [music mutes voice] [tap water rustles] [weird noises] [chair creaks] [pants] [clock ticks] Trolley... Trolley... [hums] Careful. [singing] -Move aside. -Ow! [trolley wheels creak] Ow! -Hey, why have you started in the morning? -Come on! Ow! Dogs eat these biscuits. Bro, we should know about the chick's stuff in order flatter her. Otherwise, you should be eating this stuff. Hmph! [song playing from the super market store stereo] Ow! Manager! I thought it is bread. That is not a good one. I mean that is not suitable for your skin. I've been using this for some years. Isn't my skin good? I meant, it is not a great item to use it for your skin. You know what? Umm... Um! Try this. The best one. Really? Absolutely. You know what? I know how to deal with beautiful things. Seems like you are an expert. Since they are beautiful, it is my duty to protect and preserve the beauty. Well... You are a good promoter! I'm a service provider as well. Service is not necessary. -But why?-Are you the store manager? -Yes, I'm the manager. What's the problem? -Hey... You know what this is a very good product. Do the skin test. I'll be right back. I'll just come. -Hold on. -Hey... Hello... Hello... How can you suggest me not to listen to 'Venkateshwara Suprabhatam'? You can listen but you need not make everyone to listen to it. Seems like I got a stupid customer in the morning time. -What happened? -Nothing. I made a huge mistake by playing the Suprabhatam. -See, how loudly he is speaking. -Me? Loudly? Whenever I take you with me to outside, I'd know how much foolish I am. Stay in the room and I'll get you whatever you want. -Sure? -Hmm... -Get the cotton buds. -Hmm... The world is getting doomed because of people like you. Is the world really getting doomed for playing the Suprabhatam? I don't about your world, but my world seems to be getting doomed. Bill these items. I'll be right back. Sireesha. [gasps] Sorry... I'm really sorry. [pressure pan whistles] [clock chimes] [gasps] [clock ticks rapidly] [horror movie playing on TV] -Switch it off. -Why? -Are you scared? -Yes, I'm scared of your taste. -Don't blabber. -Huh! Tell that you are scared. -Give me the remote. -Tsk... Tsk... Hey...[TV: knocking on the door] [knocking on the door] [TV: knocking on the door] -[TV: knocking on the door] -[knocking on the door] -[mumbles] -Is everything alright? Sit down. -Siri, what happened? -Hi. There's a ghost in my room. Is it really a ghost? -It is childhood my dream to see it. -Damn! -Hey, I'm not joking. -Alright, tell me. The cot is trembling. Let me narrate. The watch is getting stopped and ticking all of a sudden. The things are moving. How do you know? This happens in every horror movie. It's my foolishness to tell you. Sorry! My intention is to pacify you. Since this is a new place, you might have felt like that. -Of course, there is a ghost. -Ghosts don't exist. Hari... -Hari -Don't get scared. Sleep in my room. Please stay with me. Please, Harika. Nothing would happen. Just sleep in that room. [groaning sound from TV] I'll give 500 bucks for those who get me head gasket. -500 bucks! -Yeah! We can party all night! Bro, I found it. Wow! You are very smart, Raju! Here are your 500 rupees. I don't want 500 rupees. 100 rupees are enough. Why so? -I'm honest in every work. -Alright. What is the next item that we should get? Come on, tell us. Next item: Timing cover. Come on, bro. Why do you still want to know the time when you have a wall clock? Hey, I'm not bothered about wall clock. Get the timing cover that is inside the engine These idiots won't get any items. I have got all the items with me. Bro, I found it. Take it. -Wow! -Here, take it. Love you, dude! Here, 200 rupees. What's this bro? Just 200 rupees for this toil? It is very difficult to outrun them. I'll anyway pay you. But tell me, why is it just you who is finding all the parts? Are the other guys idiots? They are indeed idiots, bro! They are searching for old items. I'm not like them. I'm getting all those directly from the car. If the doctor comes to know about this, he will put us in the trunk and bash. We'll him that those parts got damaged. He'll install new parts. -Why should we even care about it? -[laughs] It's alright. Get the 90. 90 ml? Do you mean a quarter bottle of booze? My owner got intoxicated with that and didn't come to the garage yet. You! How can you even think 90 ml is a quarter bottle? -Then? -I meant 90 sized spanner. That's how you should tell me. I thought 90 ml means a quarter bottle of booze. -Bro, take it. -Superb, Raju! Thank you. Today, I'll have a party night with 90 ml of booze. Don't tell anything to the doctor. I'll not tell him. You to do the same. I'd lose my rep if he comes to know that I took money from you. -No, thank you. -Take it. Just take it. Cheers! Just have a sip. And you'll start craving after each sip. What happened? If you are bothered about the smell, you'll not get the courage and the ghost stays here. Take it inside and get rid of the ghost. Hey, just have it. How is it? Umm... Very good! See, after opening the Vodka bottle, neither did the ghost come nor there's been any sound. Even if it comes, I'll hold it by its plait and bang its head to the floor. Hahaha... [phone rings] My ghost is calling. I'll leave. Hey... Sit here. I'm not the one who should stay here. This should. If this is with you, you need not want anyone's company. See you again. See you again. [door shuts] [laughs] Cheers... Mwah! [creaking sound] [gasps] Oye! Shh! [creaking sound] Oh man! Don't do that! I'll take you to task now! [chair creaks] I told you not to do that. Didn't I? [laughs] [clock ticking rapidly] Oh, you are here! [shatters] Ow! [gasps] [groans in pain] Who is it? Who is it? You broke my leg! My leg! Put an ice pack on it immediately. Are you mad? Would anyone hit that hard? Oh! Are you the one who is scaring me? Yes. How? -[clangs] Ow! -How are you doing that? Don't hit it hard! I've got magnetic tools. Do you know that it's been two days that I have slept? -Hello -Yes. Are you listening? There is no ice. Is the pain gone? Why did you scare me? Tell me. I could hear the sounds that are coming from your room. Likewise! Likewise! That's the reason. Why are we hearing the sounds? My ill-fate! These Parmeshwari-Maheshwari apartments used to be in conjunction. Brothers fell apart after their father's demise and made this partition. Oh! The wall that is between them came between us. Bloody misers! Ow! What do you want now? I want you to vacate. So you are allergic to sounds. So, you're making the occupants of this room vacate forcibly. Well grasped! Vacate quickly! I won't! I won't vacate at all for what you have done. You are going to face the troubles. Are you blackmailing me? Do whatever you can. You'll end up vacating that apartment. You too. -Alright, let's see. -Okay.

Look... I won't disturb you anymore. I didn't hear you! If you mess with me, I'd do the same to you. Hey... No... No... We don't want to continue this. Let's stop this here. -Let's stop this here. -So soon? You and I, let's come to an understanding. Well, you can do whatever you want until I return from college. After that, let's share two hours each. And you shall do anything in your time and vice-versa. Let's not meddle in each other's time. Let's prepare a time table. The deal is on! The deal is on! Bro, why is he struggling like a surgeon? He is making a soundless engine. Shh! Does he know that this motorcycle belongs to Obul Reddy? I too doubt whether it would be successful or not. This motorcycle belongs to Obul Reddy and I gave it to him by putting faith. -Let's see what would happen. -I have my doubts. [chuckles] What's with him, man! Doctor Me? Start the motorcycle. This motorcycle belongs to Obul Reddy. [ignition starts] [low whirring sound] Oh no! Call the fire engine! This is going to get blazed. What have you done? Is this your hardwork of all these days on the pretence of a soundless engine, jerk? Fix each part in their original position and leave. If you ever give him any of your tools, I'll spank all of you!

My formula is in halfway. I too have an exam. [playing voilin] Damn! Just shut it! Tsk! The time isn't up. 15 minutes are remaining. Is that a violin or violence? What? What happened? It doesn't seem like you are playing. It's like slitting my neck. Uff! Oh no! You are learning violin! You got an admission in the college. The guy who gave you the admission should be kicked! It is getting difficult to play as per timings. It is not happening. Look, I'll give away my timings to you. Play as much as you can. Phew! [playing violin] Ow! Hey... Didn't you tell me just now to take as much time as I can? Is anyone holding you at gunpoint? What's wrong with your playing? That's not the case. If someone is before me or hears me, I feel conscious. The music itself is freedom. Everyone has to feel free. How would you play if you can't feel it in yourself? That's bothering me. Remove your watch. Free your hair. Feel relaxed. I mean feel free. How do you know? Something is missing in your music. As if it is tightened or froze. First, close your eyes. Feel free. It's just you in there. You know nothing about the world except the violin. The entire world contains only... you and your violin. [playing violin] For the first time, I have liked a sound. Thank you. I don't know that I'd play so wonderfully. You are very talented. This is the raaga of my mother. She used to play this tune from a veena. Well, what do you do? I'm pursuing a PhD in Mechanical engineering. [chuckles] What happened? I'm sorry. I felt it funny when I heard a mechanical engineer is allergic to sound. Oh! That's a big story. Why don't you narrate it? [screw driver whirring] Here, he is my father. His name is Dastagiri. See his looks. He seems as if he is born to follow his passionate work. And even his work seemed to be originated for him Do you know what that work is? It's difficult to say whether he chose this job or his job chose him. He gets irritated even when someone walks at some place. He won't even breathe loudly. And prevent others from doing it. [pen clinks] Ow! Oh no! He can't even tolerate the sound of the ant. She is my mother. Her name is Shantamma. She is an epitome of peace. In order to maintain peace in the house, she'd undergo fag as per what her husband likes She strives to instal a silence to the pressure cooker. This is about my family. In our house, we respect the likes of my father. It reminds me... My father likes two things. 1.) RD Burman music. 2.) This rickety scooter. Why he likes RD Burman songs is that, he sleeping listening to those songs. And when it comes to scooter, this scooter fulfilled his dream of becoming mechanical engineer by breaking down regularly. If there is anything that could make sounds in front of my father, and that would be the scooter. Would you listen to RD Burman's music?s [chuckles] I'm sorry. That's okay. Let me know when you work. Why? To disturb me? Uhuh! I won't do that. Thank you. Let me know about your work timings as well. What about your ghost? That became a human now. [door opens] Hi. Seems like you are late. What happened? I'm upset about myself. Why? Didn't you play it properly in the class? When you have instructed me last time, it has worked out. It would work out all the time. All you need to do is perform. Anyway, you have to know it on your own. I won't be with you all the time. Around? Violin! What should I call you? Just now you have called me with a name, right? Violin? That's really good. Then, do you know my name? Silencer. [song playing in shopping mall stereo] That's a mannequin, sir. -Hmm? -Hmm... -Can I get a ssofter model of that? -Why, sir? Leggings: 2000 rupees. Jeans: 4000 rupees. Lingerie: 3000 rupees. Tops: 3000 rupees. Handbag: 2000 rupees. Earrings: 6000 rupees. -The total is 20,000 rupees only, sir. -Ah! This is amount from this month's CM relief fund. -Raghu... -Yes. -Raghu... -Coming, dear. Can you come inside once? The zipper isn't closing. Try to zip it. Zip? The medium size clothing became tight on you. I look fat when I wear loose clothing. The medium-sized would be better for me. Anyway, am I fat? No... No... No... Are you fat? Not at all! I was just telling you about the fitting. Hey, wait! -Please... Just wait... Almost done... -Hey, what are you doing? -Hey... -Yeah! Mission accomplished! [door opens] -Oh! Sorry, sir. -Hey... What were you doing inside? What? Everyone knows what you did inside. Just come with me. Let them know. They'd do if they have to. Know it? I'll take you to task in the police station. Come. Sir... Hello... -We'll take care of that in the station. -Oye! It's okay if you leave, but pay the bill. Oh my freaking girl! -Sir, let's go! -Raghu... Go away! Sir, did you really release him? Otherwise, keep him with you for one more day. Go away! -Sir, the shackles! -Hey... We wouldn't undergo through this mess if they have the key? They can just lock the shackles but can't open it. Key... Shall we go to the doctor's garage? Singing: "There is a plateful of food. Eat it heartfully" "If you are hasty, the food would fall on the floor" "If you know about the farmer's toil," "you'd know the value of food, Oh dear" "Wow! This food smells delicious! Are you boxing with the lunch box? No, bro. I think this is not my lunch box. I couldn't open it. Where have you filched it from? Bro, that's not the case. This morning, my neighbour came here for his vehicle repair. I think the boxes got swapped at that time. It got opened. Curd-rice! Damn! [laughs] Seems like he is an idiot! He seems to be living on curd-rice. Hey, elders didn't say this saying. 'Whoever is destined to have the grain, only they can eat it.' I've thought about when I have filched the lunch box. Every morning I smell non-vegetarian food from my neighbour's house. I wonder who she is serving that food. I guess she's restraining her husband from eating non-vegetarian food. [laughs] Come on, walk. Seems like someone chained him again. My life became like a beat constable by roaming around with you. Is it mutton-head curry, Saidulu? It smells delicious. Won't you change your ways? If you keep fooling around like this, someone would click your photo and upload it on the Facebook titled 'rapist'. When will you realise about the meaning of life? Have you gone mad? Are you proud that you own a garage? Shut up and remove my shackles. Otherwise, I'll upload the photos of you and me. How can I open it? Ask him. He's eating curd-rice. Raju, come fast. As if that is my regular duty, bro! Hey, just eat your food silently. Idiot! -Sada... -Yes. Let me tell you something. Don't roam with him. Otherwise, you'll end up like him. Actually, I want to transform him like me. Bro... Like you? Please don't that. I'm good. I can't talk to the walls sitting inside the room. -Hey, go and remove his shackles. -Come on, remove them. Come... If there is a problem in your thesis, it means that it is inside you. You don't understand it despite I tell you. With honey, sir. I know! Daddy. It is time for the wedding. We need to start within an hour at least. -Honey...-Okay. I'll come. Get ready. Madam, I've kept ready your saree and blouse in your room. Okay. Thank you. -Sai -Sir... Iron my clothes and keep them ready. I have to attend a wedding. Why does he link it to seasonal fruits? I understood something. We need to own the PhD first. Then, everything will fall in line. I know... I know... You've decided that when you saw the girl, right? -Come on! -You! Come, let's go. Seems like a dimwit! [girl hums] Silencer... Silencer... Silencer... Silencer... Where are you, Silencer? When you are here, there'd be no fear! Silencer... [laughs] Violin. Oh! You are home? [takes deep breath] Yes. I didn't hear anything. I just sang. That's it. This is how I wanted you to be. If you be happy like this, I'll give you whatever you want for free. Seems like you had a good time playing violin in college? Yes. I have to thank you for that. What about you? Well... Mine is as usual. My professor cancelled my thesis for not getting him seasonal fruits. How many guys in this world are sincere like you? I don't care about the world. What about me? You... Hmm... You are a traditional girl who would be around 23 to 24 years old. You are having appropriate height. You have swarthy complexion. You have long hair and play the violin as well. Hmm... I am not swarthy. I'm fair-skinned. I have big eyes. What about you? Me? Umm... I'm tall. Dusky coloured and... handsome. Handsome? Actually, my friend Raghu says so. Tell me more. Hmm... More... Plain shirts, jeans and leather sandals. [Telugu song playing from the garage stereo] Hey selfie dude, lower the volume of the stereo. Hey, increase the volume of the stereo. What's this wonder? The joy of sound is of another level! What do you say, doctor? Hey, let's play a game. Come Sit. Why are you looking in a new manner? As per the happiness on your face, you might have won 100 crores lottery. Otherwise, you might have accomplished the silent-engine. Or, you might have met some girl. Yes, it is a girl. Are you bluffing me? Actually, I didn't see her at all. -Didn't see her? -Uhuh! Why are all your matters strange? Eh? We've been talking to each other through the wall since a month. But it was yesterday, that she has described about herself. What did she describe? I'm beautiful, fair, soft. -I look like Aishwarya Rai. -Hey. -My eyes are like owl's. -Tsk! Shut up, man! She didn't describe badly like this but she said something similar. Hey, some guy like you has been holding a liquor bottle in his armpit while roaming around wine shops. Tell me if you have any idea about it. Please. I'll give you an idea. Will you listen? How many years it has been since you have started building a silent engine? Seven years. What have you achieved? I've been trying but it's been failing. There was a recent failure as well. Do you really need a girl right now? Tell me, do you want to become like Raghu? Come on, tell me. What's there to tell? I'll work on the engine. Violin... Violin... Why are you silent? Why do you ask? Is my silence troubling you? A girl made me realise that I'd be happy about sound. Nothing like that. You've been immersed in your work. I've been trying this formula for soundless engines since a long time. My thesis is about soundless engines. You carry on. Shall I help? I'll be glad if that happens. [playing violin] Yeah! Violin, thank you! Thank you so much! What happened? I got this solved due to your music. I've been trying that since a long time and it got solved now. Bro... Bro... He's been swinging me... Hey, didn't I tell you? -It took seven years. -Congratulations, dude. Thanks, doctor. You have ultimately muted the sound as per your ambition. Hey, go and talk to the girl who stays beyond your wall. Your girlfriend. Now is the right time. You've somehow got tuned to her violin, right? Right? Will she meet me? Which girl wouldn't like to meet a guy at this time? Every girl would meet. Go. -Are you sure? -Just go. Go, bro. Success is yours. Today in my office, everyone got impressed by my clothing. They asked me which brand it was. Not this one. They didn't believe when I told them that I have bought it for 400 rupees. They have argued that it won't be be less than 2000 rupees. What do you say, Siri? Even, I find it unbelievable. Are you okay? My colleague Ramana... Oh man! Please, it is boring. Why do you want to talk about your office here? I cooked today. Hmm... Nice! Is it bad? That's not the case. -Today in the office... -Oh please, don't start it again. Oh! Okay... Since you like this, eating this would lighten your mood. Have it, Siri. Hmph! I've been trying to tell you something since last half an hour. -Don't you get it? -Don't talk to me like that. My colleague flattering my MD and now, he's troubling me. When I want to tell these things to you, you'd cite that they are boring. Aren't you bothered about my matters? As if you bother about my matters. Damn! Have you ever asked me what's happening in my life? Hari, I'll leave. Damn! [door opens] Where have you been? I've been to my friend's house. Why? Nothing. As you are my neighbour, I just wanted to know where you have been. I'm back, so tell me. Even I have felt like you in your absence. I felt some kind of loneliness which I never felt before. I'm unable to explain it. Same feeling, as if I'm missing something. Exactly! Likewise. We didn't meet each other but we do know about each other. We... Shall we meet? Well, if you don't like meeting me, then leave it. Well, that's not the case. I do want to meet you. But let's be like this, know and understand each other. How long should we be doing that? Until we know so much about each other. It should be to such an extent that there'd be no lifelong disturbances. Will you remain like that? Forever! Greetings, Bhadram bro. -Greetings. -You are looking awesome. -New bike, new shirt... -Stop it! Nothing is new inside. Why so? Isn't your family not taking good care of you? Of course, they are taking good care. But I'm taking care of them. -You are taking care of them? -Hmm... Why so? I got lured by their whopping dowry and chose to go as a matrilocal son-in-law. And they made me a servant. Upon waking up, I have to serve coffee to my wife and her mother. I've been cooking food and doing household chores... and been carrying a bottle of petrol with me too! What kind of torture is this! Don't cry... Don't cry... Be brave. Well, bro... Is there something wrong with the bike that you came early in the morning? I got carried away in my sorrows and forgot to tell you why I'm here. Come here. Come, bro. Start this. -This one? -Yes. [bike starts] -Did the light glow? -No. -Check now. -It is glowing. Yeah... The manufacturer of that bike has installed everything except putting a switch to that light. [laughs] That's my problem. Bro, do you know how it seems? It is as if handing the bike keys to the bus conductor. -What shall I do, bro? -Come on, bro. They are new models in the market. BS-4 model. A switch is not needed for that. The bulb would be glowing day and night. Even I was told the same by the showroom executive. Do you know what my wife said to me when I have conveyed the same? "Who is the hell is he to avoid a switch? You go, get it installed." Come on, install the switch. I won't do that. It is not required and cannot be installed as well. Never mind. Bro, don't be kidding. Listen to me. Your problem is not the bike. You, along with your wife, shall attend the marriage counselling TV programmes. All your problems will be settled there. -Can you promise me about that? -I swear it would work. Hey, what's with you? Bro, you have taken this citing necessary. But why have you brought it back? Well... I think I'm losing interest on nuts and bolts. Ah! Why are your eyes glittering like the brightest star, bro? -Is it? -I understood by looking at your eyes. Seems like your engine has started. -Here -Just 10 rupees? Have tea. "The eyes are getting converged" "The hearts are getting closer" "The bodies are setting out for desire" "And our pasts have gone into delirium" "The tranquillity is turning into loquacity" "The petulance is playing games" "The hearts are gossiping" "And are trying to establish a connection" "Yesterday's bruise in my heart turned into a song today" "My youth is coming for you like a shadow" "My lips are calling for you" "They have preserved nectar for you" "And my life would be gratifying" "The breath inside me" "have called for you" "I laid my concentration on you" "and lost myself" Damn! What shall we do now? Superb! Let's have a candlelight dinner. [snaps] Good idea! Wow! How is it? Ow! What happened? My tongue got burnt due to hot soup. Soup? Oh! We made sizzler, right? I did as per your instruction... But... What now? No problem. You... please eat. Hey... you could be open. Okay. This treat was meant to be for you. How can you not eat? You have your soup and I'd have some juice. Let me get some. Juice is healthier than a sizzler anyway. Just juice? Just juice is boring. Has a lot of calories. Add a little vodka to dilute it. Not just being alone... Someone's company could be really great... I just came to know about it. Madam... -Madam! -Huh? Enjoy your meal madam. I'll get dessert if you want. Thank you madam. [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] It's Mom. Mom, tell me... How are you? I'm good. How is Dad? Dad might have gone for a walk. What are you upto? Nothing, just the plaits. But you don't know how to weave plaits! I might not do it as perfectly as you do, but I manage. You don't know anything. I Wonder what you are cooking for yourself. Well I'm learning, but the semester exams are ahead. I'm planning to play your tune on violin. Okay Mom, I'm leaving for college. Okay? Bye. Okay, bye dear. Is your mother a musician? Well, I heard some sounds at night? Well... I had juice as you were having soup. But there's something about hunger, it doesn't let you sleep. So I ate the sizzlers. Okay, I'm about to leave now. Violin! You didn't answer my question! Yeah... she was a good musician. But once upon a time. My father didn't support her career after marriage. That's okay. Atleast he is supporting you! Okay, bye. Bye. We have to wind up buying vegetables soon. Okay, you be on it. I'll just look around. Hey! Don't fool around. -Got to get back and be on the project. -Ah! As if you're completing it today! Tomatoes... bro! -What is the price of tomatoes? -100 rupees per KG. -What? Say it aloud? -Hundred rupees. Whats up? You've started to ask people to speak aloud! -What's happening? -Oh, come on... Hey... isn't he Biscuit Sai? Biscuit Sai? The Sai who studies first year man. It's him. You know he almost works like a servant at Professor Murthy's house. -Is the colocasia tender? -This time, he'd not just top the class He'd bag the gold medal for sure. Sir needs tender Gherkins, tender cucumbers... and drumsticks too. Argh! -Who the hell is that? -Oh my... Oh it's you Raghu sir! Good morning! Professor Murthy needs Pumpkins at his age. -Oh no... -Give him a glass of Pumpkin juice daily and he would get some wisdom to give us some marks. Anyway, you've got to sip some tea at the tea stall reading the news at this time but why are you doing these chores? I really pity you, kid. You can't expect me to pursue PhD for eight years like you, sir! Ah! You're mocking your seniors, aren't you? Well, you won't listen to well wishers. Here... give him this. [Sai scoffs] -It's good for health. 50 rupees for beans. VEGETABLE SELLER: The green chilli... Vegetable market has better girls than the supermarkets. Uh? Colocasia is good for treating his Piles. -Hello. -Greetings. Do you have some fresh vegetables? Why? Don't you see these are all fresh? The green chilli looks a bit greener! Well the heat gave them the green. [vegetable seller chuckles] What are you upto? -Was just asking the price of tomatoes. -Oh... Whats the price of tomatoes? Tomatoes are priced 400 rupees a Kilo. 400? The old man is selling for 100! Hey! She has decided the price for the crop she grew. Women empowerment isn't just the subject of social media posts. It has to be put to practice. Pack me four Kilos. Well... What's the secret of your beauty? Carrots! Carrots give a lot of charm! Why do we need carrots now? Ah! How can you say no to carrots when she said it adds charm? What's the price of carrots? 100 rupees a Kilo. Oh that's it? Give me three Kilos. Okay. What would you do with three Kilos? Look at her skin tone! We have to drink carrot juice everyday to get that glow. -What's this man? -Ah... Do you have some cotton with you? Huh? Do they sell cotton in a vegetable market? -Why do we need cotton? -So that you could stuff your ears. Get going. -Give me your phone number. -Done with shopping? What for? Well, the vegetables would be more fresh if I could buy from your home. My house is far away, you can travel so far. Well, my friend is like a dog. He will follow you anywhere. -What? [Raghu spits] I won't go home unless I sell everything. What's the price of everything? 500 for lady's finger, 500 for green chillies, 1000 for tomatoes... 500 for capsicum and 1000 for carrots. 5000 for everything. -Cool. -Sir, is someone getting married? Well if she says yes... Can you give me your phone number now? I will give my number, but look up once. Brother! You've been fooled in MIC TV Bakra programme! Your performance was awesome! How do you feel? Tell me? -One minute, bro. -Where could I get red flowers? -I'll take a pic of yours. -Why red flowers? -They're for you Raghu... sir! -You... Come, bro... smile! [door bell rings] Oh! How are you mom? I'm good, son. Where is father? He thought this isn't your house and heading further! This way, father! You've been here earlier! I thought this wasn't your place as the door bell was ringing. Come inside. [Sadhanand humming] [chair creaks] [aloud] What did you get mother? I'll go get some coffee. [slurping] What is this sound? Wha... what sound, father? I can hear some sound. The sound of air. Close the door. [door creaks shut] [munching sound] -Son... -Yeah. -How are you studying? -Awesome, mother. Who is the girl? Which girl? That's what I'm asking, who is the girl? Why did you ask that? You've changed a lot. You aren't like earlier. You aren't like your father, you've changed. Listen... let's start tomorrow morning. Sleep now. Why hurry? We just came today morning! We'll stay for a couple of days with him. I can't stay amidst such noise. Go and sleep. [cell phone ringing] Yeah, tell me dude. Yeah... alright! I'm working on a thesis. I'll call you back. Yeah... bye. Thesis huh! Hey! Wash it well! So you just pass orders, eh? Hey! I'm your senior. You've got to obey me! Well I'm the senior here. You've got to obey me. What's with your high headedness eh? Idiot! Hey! Get up now. -And why? -I'll wash that. Ah! Enough of your tricks. Only I get to wash Priyanka Madam's clothes. Hey! Another word and I'll make sure your entry to canteen is closed. Fine. Priyanka madam would give me food. What's with your 'Priyanka Madam' thing man? -I'll thrash you! -No, it's mine! -Whom are you fooling? -It's mine! Whoever gets the bigger piece gets her. Priyanka madam... The clothes have dried. Why is this torn? Raghu did that. -Raghu? -Yeah! Yeah, tell me? There is a scientific reason behind that! You've got reasons to tear it? Absolutely! What? That colour doesn't suit you. -So you know which colour suits me? -I do. Wow it's my favourite colour! Thank you so much! Yeah. Actually, this colour suits your skin tone a lot. [cell phone ringing] Well, you are getting a call. Hello... I was just thinking. Raghu... err... Raghu sir. -Oh! Whats with this 'Sir' again? -Well you are my senior. Ah! Sir... I have a doubt. How do you know that her favourite colour is pink? I don't have much work... -What's the colour of her top? -It's pink. And her earrings? You said there is a party? -Pink. -And why do you think like a loser? Research ain't washing clothes. It's entertainment. Give the girls entertainment and you get attention from them. -Got it, eh? -Yeah. [cricket commentary on TV] Sireesha has invited us for dinner. -Do you hear me? -Four... yes! I know you heard me. So you must also know that I'm not interested. Well, I do. But everyone needn't understand that! -Why are you always late? -Ah! So long since you invited me! -Does it look good? -Yeah! What is this? You know our professor Murthy. I don't get to drink in a bar after spending on his dry fruits. Wel you invited me, so thought we both shall booze. And don't mess with that. Okay, come. [Sireesha laughs] Didn't you scare her? Or was it you who got scared? Well... And why are you feeling shy? What are these things doing here? -Come. -You're behaving weird. -Hi. -Hi. And why did you get ready so well? -There are girls in there? -Hey... You should have told me! -Stay silent... please. -Take it easy man. Looks you've changed the room's look. -What? There too? -Hey! Here... hold this. Cheers. Hmm! When did you learn to cook? Someone taught me. Who is that? I want to introduce you to someone. He is Mister... -Silencer. -Silencer? What kind of a name is that? It's between me and her... And his friend Raghuram. Oh! She knows me too? [scoffs] Great! This is crazy! Oh! Just like talking over a call. -So is this through the wall? -Hmm! Raghu... meet Violin. Yeah. And... Her friends Harika and Arya. Well call them over here then. -Let's gobble it all. -Stop it now! We didn't meet till now. Well... please don't call us by our names. You too. You don't know each other's names. You didn't see each other. Do you atleast know what you are doing? We are knowing about each other. Not just that. We are giving support to each other. Above all, we started liking each others likes. [Raghuram coughs] That's foolish! Without meeting or seeing each other... how could you know each other? We are in a live-in relationship since an year. And we aren't able to tell confidently if we are perfect for each other. It depends on the individual's relationship. I'm not here to get preached about my relationship. Wait wait, are you both... in a relationship. -Ah, relationship in the sense... -Whatever it is between you... You both should know in and out about each other. Very openly! [scoffs] Only then any relationship will stay strong. We should follow before we preach. -You have to follow. -Why are you taking it personal? I know whom you are talking about. I don't want to argue with you. You know what, I'm just leaving. Just leave it! Violin, I have a question for you. -When you see our carburettor... -Hmm! Silencer! Once you see silencer and what if you don't like him? Not once I see, I already saw! His heart! [belches] Mine relationship is all about physical attraction. These long term courses won't work. Just single sitting! Hey! So no one became close to your heart. Why not? Ofcourse they did! The came and left! That's all. Not everyone! But there would someone... that only when you are with that someone... You'd experience a magical feeling which you'll fall short of words to put in "I felt the first feeling of love today..." "...because of you" "Time has stopped..." "...since I saw you." "Words heard have penetrated the heart..." "...and has moved the hope that stood still" "I could hear the sound of footsteps..." "...that made silence speak for the first time" "I'm a loner..." "...and this is my world" "Are you the boon granted to my heart?" [humming] [sneezes] [chuckles] Got drenched? Yeah! I feel feverish. Can I... You are with me anyhow. Yes I am. But... Can you do me a favour? What is it? Could you come closer? Gives me some courage. "Both hearts thump with the same life" "To drive away the lasting sorrow from my heart" "When would you show yourself to me?" "When the light pierces in to my eyes" "I wait for that moment" "I'm a loner..." "...and this is my world" "Are you the boon granted to my heart?" "I felt the first feeling of love today..." "...because of you" "Time has stopped..." "...since I saw you." "...since I saw you." Being married, my life has become that of a garage car. -What a plight! -Come on strike! Obul Reddy will come now. We both will discuss the matter. None of you kids must interfere. You may get hurt, mind you! It not as easy as you shoplift things. He will bash you black and blue -Are you trying to threaten me? -Strike it man! [bullet engine whirring] Obul Reddy is here! Run everyone! Who is here in the shed man? He ruined my bullet's sound. Who the hell is that scumbag? Hey Raju! Are you deaf? Is grease jammed in your ears? You silly fellow! Don't call me names bro. I feel very bad. Hey there's so much fun pulling someone's leg. Yeah, I know how much fun it is for you. Are you planning to hang spanner and nuts in your hair? Style bro! Style is it? Even you mouth is overflowing, just shut it off. -Hey Lakshman... -Yes bro... Didn't you shave your birth hair? Not really, my dad asked me to grow it as it is our family tradition to. Tradition is it? Sounds interesting, tell more about it. Should I? "If it goes Grey, you can always dye" "If it sheds off, it might cost you heavy to buy a wig" "The bald man worries as he doesn't have hair" "The one with long hair worries about tangles" "It accompanies us in birth and death" "What is wrong in growing it? Utmost it might fall, that's it!" Is it a sin to grow it? Whoa! What a song bro! Sang it very well! But you have to cut it before my next visit. Else I will send you to some temple and get it shaved there. Do you get it? [phone ringing] Keep shaking this! Why should I shake it? Baby where are you? What? On the bike? Didn't I tell you? Didn't I say that I'd book a cab for you? Baby, you don't get it. Do you know there's some much of pollution outside? Who told you baby? Please baby! You are on a diet baby. You please don't feel shy in telling such things. I will order food online, it will be delivered to home. Baby, never repeat such things. Ah! You didn't tie a scarf either? That's the reason I get angry with you at times. Wrap a stole atleast. I will come. I'll be there in an hour. Five minutes please. Please baby! Please! Ok see you! Hey where did the doctor go? Who the hell is that braying like a donkey? What is your problem man? -How do I look to you? -Why are you shouting? They changed my bike's sound. It's sounding odd. Don't I look funny then? What is that bottle in your hand? Juice! Shake it, you will know it yourself. I shook many such ones! They are lying outside the garage now. What do you need? The sound has changed. Will you keep quiet if it was your bike? Raju, look into his issue and shut his mouth. Change the bike's silencer, people are finding it funny. -Look into it man! -Who spoiled my bike man? Why do you ask me bro? You look as small as a silencer, why do you raise your voice man? Shake this! Enough? Everyone looks like dimwit here. All brainless idiots! [phone ringing] My sweetest baby! Why did you call me again? Who is he? You wretched woman! Just stay put! [door bell rings] Dad... Please come! Mom didn't mention about your arrival at all. I just wanted to see you, so here I am. I would have come to the station to pick you up. It's ok dear, You look weak. Why do you stay up all night? Sleep early. I got drenched in the rain, had fever too. You must have done it deliberately, I know you. We elders always say keeping your welfare in mind. You first freshen up! We shall have breakfast together. Come! -Do you have classes today? -Do you have to talk to me? It's ok, we can talk once you come back from college. Hmm ok. Have you learned to cook too? Just trying my hands on. It's the same with everything dear, you'll find it difficult in the beginning later, you yourself will get used to to. Hmm! Superb! Upma tastes delicious. Thanks dad. -Dad, I'm going to college. -Hmm! -Bye dear! -Bye! [mouths 'bye'] Coffee! Arya... Coffee! Is you love towards me lessening? Or are you just being fed up of me? I should ask you that? -You are not like the old-times Arya! -I am just the same then and now too. Its been so long since we spoke happily? You never left to work without dropping me at my office. You used to eat my favorite dishes when you were hungry. But now... You forgot the day we both first met. These may seem to be petty things but these are enough to say that the distance between our hearts is growing Love should grow if we are living together. But the for us, the distance is growing, Arya. You should know the reason for it. Not just me. You too give it a thought. But what is the problem between us? If you find living with me is problematic, you decide whether you want to or not. [door closes] Dad... Dad... -Dad... -Sireesha... My dad... Did you speak to my dad? Ah Lakshmi... You first listen to me. I came to Sireesha. I will bring her home saying that you are unwell. -Do you get it? -I mean... This is a very good match in all means. Argh! You just don't talk anything else! Varun got a chance to go to the USA. They are planning to perform the wedding before he leaves. I'm her father after all. I would always wish for my daughter's good life but nothing else! Once she gets used to it, she would then start liking it too. Everything seems odd until one gets used to it. [loud noise] Looks like there's an earth quake here. Will call you later. -[panting] -Hello! Don't ghosts scare you? Only earth quakes do? Hey who is that speaking from behind the wall? Though I speak from behind the wall, I don't lie like you. Will a father ever lie to her daughter? Who the hell are you to talk about it? How does it concern you? You didn't understand dad and daughter's relationship. How will you understand our relationship? Your daughter has a goal, support her if you can. But do not spoil it. You first mind your own business. Else I may have to call the police. Police? What else can you do? You ruined you wife's interests then and now your daughter's. Hey, my wife is happy. And my daughter... She promised me before joining this course, that once she finishes her course... she'd marry her cousin as per our word. Do you get it? What? Did she promise you that she'd marry her cousin? Yes! A lot of times I wanted to tell you... Then why didn't you tell me? Then why didn't you tell me? Then why did we have to get to know each other? What was it all for? But whom am I to question you? You don't know my name and whom am I. I'm just your company as you stay alone. Just a time pass! To the best of my knowledge, your course was also a time pass. You just bluffed saying it was your mother's dream. No... Please listen to me... That is why I don't like your world. I will live in my own world. I have been telling you the same. That's not love. How can you call it love? As you've been living with nuts and bolts for years, you just felt lonely. In that moment, when she appeared there, you just got attracted. That's all. You don't believe it? Just tell me what have you fell for her? Her nose or eyes? Moreover you keep calling each other with funny names like silencer and violin. -Sireesha! -What? Her name is Sireesha! What a wierd name is that? That of a daily soap actress! You! You are just like Lord Buddha! You should stay detached! How does her whereabouts matter you? You just snap your fingers! I will make girls line up for you! Come on snap it man! Yes! Do you want girls from sociology, or political science? or English? There are too many girls in English specialization. Why do you look here and there? Listen to me. Who do you... [phone rings] I forgot to put it on silent mode. Hello, I'm right here, just beside the road. I'm coming, just 2 minutes. I am coming, just 2 minutes! Ok bye bye! Actually I didn't want to ask you. I'm not sure how odd it sounds too So if you can, I have my parents at home. I can't drop the plan suddenly. Please don't look at me like that. Just give me your house keys. Damn! What is wrong in it? What did Murthy say? What goes around comes around. That means if you help me for my love, it will be helpful to your love. Is yours love? How could you say that? Love is the same for all. Yeah it is! People like you are right! Here, take the keys, and take the girl you like too. Go! Thank you Buddha! Bro, serve him double peg! [phone ringing] [grunts] [smashes] -Silen...-Please, one second, listen to me. -Hold on! Please! -Shh! What is this? Just get up! Please listen to me. [indistinct chatter] Listen, move! Get away. One moment. [Door thuds] What happened? -I heard some sound. -I didn't hear anything. Why would you? Get up! -I shouldn't hear too. -Raghu please! [sighs] Ok sit up! Wait please! -What is it, tell me? -Check out for yourself. Hmm? -For me? -Hmm! For you! How is it? Didn't you like it? I always gifted others, but never really received one. So I grabbed that lucky chance! Hmm? What happened? I... I have some work! -Shall we go? -What happened? Raghu... [sighs] [door closes] Was she good? Are you done? So soon? Hey what are you talking? I agree it is a mistake not to tell you something important. So will you get a girl home for that? Girl... Which girl are you talking about? Yeah, you are a very innocent boy! Lord Buddha! You know nothing about the girl or the kisses! I didn't hear anything. For what you've done, I should have broken this wall and bashed you Hey, that was not me! Yeah, not you! A ghost! Woman turned into a ghost again. It was Raghuram not me. Will you blame Raghuram to cover it up? Things wouldn't have come this far, if you had understood me. True, as though you understood me very well. Psch! Why do even talk to you! Yeah, when you have other girls, why would you talk to me? Yes, I don't want to talk to you. You too don't talk to me. Get married to the guy your dad chose for you and go away from here. Fine, I will marry him. Please do! "Eyes are filled with tears" "Is this the wound inflicted by fate?" "The dream of uniting with each other is spoilt" "Is the distance getting bigger?" "After giving me company and becoming so important" "Love has left me" "Any chance the pain could be cured" "and the distance be lessed, oh love?" "So much that you became my world" "I dream of you every moment" "You made me a loner now" "Yet, I wait for you..." Your project has been published in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. We liked the project a lot. We are ready to fund it. Thank you, sir. -But I need some time. -It's OK. Hey Sadha, what happened to you? Why did you work hard day and night for seven years? Now is the time your dream is coming true. It was your dream. I don't know. "Bodies near to each other" I'm unable to understand anything. "but hearts are distant, why does worry haunt?" [phone ringing] "How much ever is the distance, hearts are together" Yes father... Where are you, son? -I came out on work. -Why do you sound troubled, son? Nothing, father. I'm good. Come home for some days if you don't feel good. Okay, father. I will call you later. "Love is a magical maze" "If we reject it once" How is Siri? "It's a danger that would bring us to zero" "So much that my world changed" "I dream of you every moment" "You made me a loner now" "Yet, I wait for you..." [metal clinking] Hey, I'll ask you something. Answer me. Tsk! Why don't you sit and talk with that girl? It would clear the misunderstandings. That's not possible. She doesn't trust me. In the entirety of your life, when a girl loved you as the person you are, will you leave her? Hey, I didn't intend to leave her. -Even, she didn't intend... -Why not? She said that she'd marry her cousin by doing her favourite course. What kind of logic is that? [scoffs] Girls don't gave freedom before marriage. That's why guys don't have freedom after marriage. She should inform me, right? She should inform me, right? Hmm... Is it? Why did she feel bad when she thought that you were with some girl in your room? Hey, there won't be straight answers for many things in life. If everything is discussed by sitting together, it'd become business. When one understands some inexpressible things, that's love. How come you are talking about love? Hey, he told a nice thing about girls for the first time. What he said is 100 percent correct. I feel that there is no mistake of the girl. Well... Why do you seem to be new person? New? Eh? I didn't tell you, right? The daughter of Professor Murthy... -She... -Daughter of Professor Murthy? Yes, it is like... Blimey! This chain-guy too fell in love! It just happened, dude... [laughs] Mother, I'm coming home. I'm hating this place. What happened? Nothing. I don't want to study anymore. I'd get married as per father's wish. Your father wants you to learn music. You need not think about marriage. Mother, I have taken the decision. See you. Violin, will you listen to me please? I listen to no one. Phew! I don't have any right to change your decision but I have the right to express my opinion. Music is your ultimate goal, Violin! You have already spent a lot of time for it, fought for it and brought it till here. You didn't simply get this chance. There is your mother's wish behind your arrival to here. Moreover, you have given hopes that you'd make your mother's dreams into reality. Don't cheat yourself out of anger on me. I need not want your lecture. If you want to leave this place because of me, don't go. I will go instead. I'm not leaving because of you. I won't give you such a priority. Sure. But give priority to yourself. Your exams are two days away. Better attend them and go. Just because I have told you, don't react in the other way. Don't miss this chance. Think for yourself, not me. "Relationships have ended, breath stopped" "Is there a cure for this?" "When there is mutual trust," "there won't be any scope for suspicion" "If there is sincerity in love" "Neither there would be a beginning nor it would come to an end" "The heart would be filled with skyful of love" "Let the summer pass... Let the rainy pass" "It's just a formless life" "So much that you became my world" "I dream of you every moment" "You made me a loner now" "Yet, I wait for you..." Good luck. I might not be here when you come back. [door creaks and shuts] [playing violin] Thank you, madam. Sireesha Meghana. First, close your eyes. Feel free. It's just you in there. You know nothing about the world except the violin. The entire world contains only... you and your violin. [playing violin] [applause] Heard that you have played very well. Ultimately, you have achieved what you wanted. Your friends told me... I felt very happy when they said that everyone was appreciating you. Your mother, along with your father would feel very happy. What happened? Sir, why are you thinking so much? Anything wrong? I have been searching for you everywhere. I have been to your office as well. You aren't answering my phone calls. Did you remember me now after fifteen days? What about you? Did you call me either? Well, come with me. What has happened has happened. I won't be like that from now. Are you sure that we are suitable for each other? Yeah. Liking each other isn't love. It is about liking their partner's interest. Both of us don't have such kind of liking. If we are really made for each other, your company should inspire me. Your word should become my motivation. It should fetch me happiness. Not only that, but you should also be by my side even in your absence. [footsteps approaching] Silencer. Silencer. Silencer. I know you are there. I have to tell you several things. My long awaited dream became reality because of you. I have accepted my parents' will to pursue the course of my interest but not out of consent. In your encounter... In your love... I lost myself. I want you. I want your love. I want your company forever. [weeping] [loud thud sound] [loud thud sound] [music]
