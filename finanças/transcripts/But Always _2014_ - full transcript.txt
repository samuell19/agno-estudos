Hi Hi Nice to see you, you're back. Yes. It's me, Anran. When I was 4, the Tangshan earthquake affected many areas. Almost everyone slept on the streets in Beijing that summer. To an innocent child, those were the happiest days of my childhood. No school, I played with other kids in the neighborhood all day long. Whose kid is this? Sit down, Anran! I want a word with you. People are sick in Tangshan, they need Mommy's help. What about me? You must learn to take care of yourself, be a doctor when you grow up Like me, understand? Yes. Listen to Daddy. Attention, members of the rescue team! Gather at the east gate, we'll be leaving soon. Attention, members of the rescue team! We're leaving, please meet at the east gate right away! I'll do it... but I'm not very good. Mommy can fix it when she comes home. But I knew she wasn't coming home. The rescue team had an accident in the earthquake area. Dad didn't want to admit it. Tongjia Lane, please get off here. Dad transferred me to a new school far away from home, because he didn't want the neighbors to gossip about me not having a mother. Hey! Girl! Are you from Hong Kong? Where is that? Does King Kong live there? Stupid! You don't even know where it is? She's wearing leather shoes! Give Anran a big cheer! Sun Yuejin, be quiet! Give Yongyuan a big cheer! Give Yongyuan a big cheer! Go - Well? - I gave it to her. "Anran, I hear you have good grades," "can you help me with my homework?" "Salute, Sun Yuejin!" Anran, our assignment is Questions 4-6? - Yes. - What about the last one? - No. - OK, thanks. Yongyuan, keep an eye on Anran for me. Hurry up! Go! Since that day, this Zhao Yongyuan started to follow me around. I was so annoyed with this filthy bugger, I decided never to speak to him. But it happened, I was the one who initiated our first conversation. I recall that day was extremely cold. Why do you wear such a small hat? None of your business. My Mom bought it for me. Why didn't she buy one that fits? My Mom... is dead. Close door, go. Zhao Yongyuan, you're late again! And no red scarf, write him up! I can see. The electric bill won't pay itself, you wastrel! What are you looking for? Look at this... See the holes you made in this blanket? Even Grandma can't fix them. Wait till next spring, if I have extra money, I'll get someone to fix it for you. Come here! Come here! Change your scarf! Change it! I don't want to write you up, or for the teacher to punish you. Change it! My turn! - Four! - One! Zhao Yongyuan, you're not playing? Mom, hawthorn fruit candy. OK, I'll buy it for you Grandma, want some? Where did you get that? A classmate gave it to me. A classmate? Those kids always bully you. Who would buy you fruit candy? You steal it? No! I didn't steal it! No? Did you steal it? You're g etting out of hand! You'll e nd up in jail some day. I'll be letting your parents down if I let you off easy. It's not easy for me taking care of you. Don't be mad, Grandma! I really didn't steal it. Just tell me if you want something. Here, pa y your classmate back. Money fo r the fruit candy. Why? Grandma said only a loser would take things from someone. It's OK, you can keep it. If you w on't take it. I won't ride the bus with you. Don't worry, just take it. From now on, I'll follow you wherever you go. Come on! The sun shines and the rooster sings. Flowers awaken while birds groom their feathers. Birds build new nests while bees make honey. The happiness of life comes from the fruit of labor. Anran, let's play a game. I'm not leaving. Why? You can't stay here! Grandma is gone, understand? Who's going to take care of you? I'll spank you if you don't behave! Anran... I've to get off! What for? Come back! I won't spoil you like Grandma! Sit down! Anran... I'm so used to the sound of his footsteps. I thought he would never leave me. But then he disappeared without a trace. Years have gone by, each time I pass by this bus stop, I would think of that little bugger. What happened to him? What does he look like now? Excuse me... Sorry! Kid... You little punk! You stole the shoes!? No, people will buy them when they see how nice they look on me. How dare you! Here, carry this for me! They look nice, I should wear them too. No, you'll only mess it up. The dry air, the sound of doves whistling through the sky, the different dialects I hear on the streets... In my dreams, I've returned to this city many times. Now I'm finally back, I see more skyscrapers, and less of the familiar lanes. Except for Grandma, there was a girl who was nice to me. Is she still here? The goods are ready Excuse me... Let me do it. No, I'll get it. I go from south to north, walk from day to night. I want people to see me without recognizing me. Please give me some water if I look tired, Please kiss me if you're in love with me. My days in medical school went by quickly, and I was about to graduate. I followed my Dad's wishes getting ready to continue my graduate school in the U.S. The thought of leaving Beijing leaves me feeling a bit melancholic. I didn't want to leave the city I grew up in, despite its gradual changes. You know how many millionaires come from this street. Make deals, understand? You just won't listen. Money is everything, no money no talk. Reality is harsh, right? Except your parents and me as your uncle, nobody in the world will be nice to you. Hey girl, come on! They're $10 each. This one... let me see. We don't have your size. How much is this? $200 for you, our first customer, $150, OK? Take it for $150. $130! $100 and a scarf! Take a look, $10 each Why should I learn English? "Because what", use that to create a sentence. Why are you learning English? Because I... I want to earn foreign exchange certificates. I want to work for a foreign corporation. I want to marry a foreigner. Quiet! Quiet! Why do you learn English? Because I want to study abroad. Perfect! I like that! Anran... Mr. Yibai!! With your talents and my private tutoring, passing the GRE and TOEFL will be easy. - You're gifted in linguistics, - Thank you! But talent alone is not enough. You need overseas connections. Which school did you apply for? Columbia. That's great! I've a friend in L.A. Who can help you. That's a bit far, Columbia is in New York. That's still part of the U.S. No, thanks. I should go. Anran, this reference book is quite useful. I already have it, thanks. Anran, I just want to say... - Hey you! Don't... touch her! - You little punk! Which class are you in? What do you want? Which class are you in? You're a pervert! Don't touch her! Zhao Yongyuan! Zhao Yongyuan! The rain... You look so different! Before you were only this tall... No one calls me Zhao Yongyuan anymore. What happened to you? I haven't heard from you all these years. My uncle brought me to Guangzhou. I just came back. How are you? I'm fine. How did you find me? I was a wild kid, remember? Of course I can find you. You were a wild kid since you were little. Come closer... You looked at a shirt for a long time today. How did you know? I have my ways. I also know you wish to study abroad. When are you leaving? It's not that easy. I haven't set a date. Let me know when you leave. Don't disappear like I did. Now you know! You left without a word and disappeared for years. Don't ever do that again! What's wrong? You seem distracted. Is it difficult to study in the U.S.? Absolutely, you need to pass TOEFL and GRE. You need tofu and Auntie G to go abroad? What's Auntie G? Introduce her to me, he's too young! I heard it... GRE is a test! It's very hard, my cousin failed it 2 years in a row. I see... is there a way around it'? Why? You want to go abroad? Not me. It's for a friend of mine. What friend? Boy or girl? Girl? Marry a foreigner. Ask him! See if he'll marry her. Him? He's from Russia! It's not the same, understand? They require a security deposit in the bank, then you can go to the U.S. Don't listen to him! Focus on making money, punk. You know how to make money? Show off when you have money, OK? Finally! Here we go... Goods from Hong Kong, it's a hit in Hong Kong, probably in the whole world. What is it? Open it! Be careful! This is fun! What the hell is it? No... What are you doing here? The yo-yo that took Hong Kong by storm is here in Beijing. A sensation! How much? $5. I wouldn't pay $1 for it, let alone $5. Some tricks, let me show you! Be careful! Xiaojun... Help Old Ji sell it. Take a look I'm doing fine selling socks. What? I'm doing fine! Your hair is messed up. The socks are selling great. What a big mouth! Starting to get angry? Fatty, why are you standing there? You like it? Take one home if you like it. You have money? No? No? Go ask your Dad. Dad... Just give it to him. Up to you. Thanks sister. Xiaojun, I'm not teasing you, can't you tell! It's none of your business! I slave myself for nothing! Sister, sister I want one. Me too. Xiaojun, they're popular! One for each! OK, line up. Don't push! Pay and take one. This way. So it's really you! Anran! Sun Yuejin! Long time no see! Long time no see! Yongyuan, I really can't tell! My treat! Great! Bottoms up! What about you'? You said you don't drink? You're quite a drinker. Xiaojun! What are you doing here? Just a coincidence. Join us. My old classmates. Hello! Nice to meet you. I'll get some drinks. No, I'll do it. You really look like a movie star. The next song is for my buddy. He wants to dedicate it to a very special girl. I pray for love without any pain but I can't stop the tears I pray that I can forget you but I still sing the song you taught me In the company of my shadow I know it in my heart and I know... Anran, what are you doing here? How did you know it's me? I've followed you for so many years, I recognize the sound of your footsteps. I don't believe you. Even if I close my eyes now I can still tell your footsteps in a crowd. Why get such a thick blanket? When I was little, I made holes easily in my blanket that made me feel cold at night. From now on, you'll never be cold again, things will get better. I'm your family now. You kept this? One for each of us. I don't know what's wrong with me. The thought of Zhao Yongyuan makes my heart beat faster. I don't know how to deal with the little changes between us. Eat it while it's hot. What's wrong? You're sick? Anything you wish to tell your dad? The yo-yos are sold out. Anran never showed up again. I know she's going to leave sooner or later. I don't dare dream of being with her, but I still want to do something for her. Did you understand'? The professor said to skip this chapter. We won't be tested on it. The whole chapter? Are you sure? Don't worry! Anran, as a new immigrant in the U.S. it's hard to work and study, are you worried? What to worry about? I'll see when I get there. What's so great about the U.S.? They say everyone lives in a basement apartment at the beginning, and use things they find from a dumpster, and stuff like that. They make a living by washing dishes and other tough jobs. When they can't stand it, some girls would find a foreigner. To marry a westerner? You think Anran can stand it? That's why I need to make more money so she can have a better life. Why send her away if you're in love with her'? Sacrifice so much for nothing! Yes, I do love her, but she's meant for a different life. You'll never get rich by selling those one by one. Of course not! A friend of mine owns a factory in Guangzhou, he's placing orders with me to do wholesale. That's not easy. What about the buyers? Coming. Besides, we still have an edge. In 3 to 5 years, everyone will be wearing the clothes I make. How long? 3 years Can Anran wait? What happens in the meantime'? If you want to make easy money, you must get into foreign exchange. You don't get it? International finance brings in the cash quicker than your trade. You can make enough on the spread alone. I'll hook you up with connections. How much can you make from this nonsense? Forget it! Brother Ping! Long time no see... - He is... - My buddy, Zhao Yongyuan. Hello! He wants to be part of the team, help him out... OK, come this way. Let's go! What's the rate? 8.6 Are you kidding? 8.6 is fair. - Brother Hai! - Brother! Help me collect the money! Old Liu! Not again! Who is it? I told you about him. Don't! Hai is here. Hai? What? - He's the local boss. - Still want to exchange? - Yes! - No... I've seen him before. Let's go... Run away. Hua, let's go! Congratulations, you finally got your visa. Don't forget us after you go to the U.S. I won't. We have to go. Let's go. What's this? I don't want it. Anran! Stop it! Where are we going? Who are you? You've a lot of nerve doing business on our turf! - You want to die? - Let's get out of here. Nice chick. Beat the crap out of him! Go Go get him! Come inside! Oh my God! You've a business to run, why mess with them? I want to make some quick cash for you. I don't want your money. You're a fool! I used to hate school, now I think it's quite a nice place. I'll wait for you at the bus stop tomorrow night. I want you to meet my Dad. I want to tell him I'm not going to the U.S. OK. Everything is all set. Columbia University. Anran studying abroad has fulfilled her Mom and my dreams. Right. Yes, yes. Thank you! Anran... I can't look after you when you go abroad, Dad, l... You must take care of yourself. This watch... I want you to keep it. Your Mom gave it to me, she used to wind it for me, until that year... Dad... You used to ask me why I didn't get it fixed. It doesn't really need to be fixed, it just stopped at that moment. Like your Mom watching me grow old and you grow up. Hurry up, don't be late! Don't dilly-dally! Don't be a nag! I'm telling you, give it your best shot. Anran is willing to give up the U.S. for you. How do I look? Great! I'm going. Wait! It's raining, take an umbrella. Sun Yuejin, what are you doing here? Say something! Where is he? You should go home. What did you say? Go home, he's not coming. No way! He's definitely coming. We agreed. He doesn't love you. It's true, he's not coming. He has someone else, go to the U.S. He is not serious about you! He doesn't want you anymore! Please go, go! Hurry! We're running out of plates! Zhao Yongyuan your letters have been returned. The doctor said it's nothing major. But... you had a miscarriage. Whatever you have been through, we're all strangers in a foreign land. If you want let me look after you from now on. Everything will be fine. You're under arrest for assault. Come with us. Can you give me an hour'? - An hour? - Don't move! - Just 1 hour - You almost killed someone. The punishment for assault is 3 to 5 years imprisonment. But I didn't expect to get out after a year. I started to take orders for wholesale, sold my clothes to Japan, Russia and Singapore, and now the U.S., a place I often dreamt about. The data is inaccurate, I can't base my budget on this. Why are you doing this to me all the time? We managed to fulfill these big orders because Uncle Ji and I planned ahead. Who? You and Uncle Ji? Yongyuan had always wanted to do this. Then why isn't he here? Why do you always go against me? When did I do that? Sun Yuejin! You're awake! Thinking of Anran again? Don't blame me! Back then, I didn't... OK... - Sleep! - I can't help it. He told me to let her go. But Anran wouldn't budge. What can I do? I lied about there being someone else. I'd be devastated if I were in her shoes. What are you doing? The painting... What's the use? Nobody wants to buy them! Why bother? I can't even pay my rent, I'm living off a woman! Sorry! I'm just angry with myself. I'm sorry! Everything will be fine. That's what you told me. This is just temporary. Yes. I'll be right there. We have a group of 20 from China. I have to go. I've an interview after work, I can't have dinner with you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm starting to doubt your sincerity. We need a much lower price. Mr. Leo, we are sincere. Our price is the lowest. No, it's not the lowest price. But our quality is the best. That maybe so, but you certainly don't have the lowest price. Xiaojun... Mr. Leo, we came overseas seeking a long term partnership. The company is established and we are ready. We shall work very closely with your marketing team. And I doubt if any other company can do so. If my memory is correct, last year due to lack of communication, I know that your team lost a sum of $10m. Which major do you study and which university do you attend? I'm studying at Columbia Medical school. I major in Biomedical Engineering and I'm graduating this year. What's your research topic? Pharmacology of anti-leukemic drugs. Are you an international student? Yes! Michael, Say something! Anran! I don't want to be your burden. What are you saying? We should break up. I hope you'll understand. I'd like to thank you all for coming, and cheers! Cheers! Mr. Zhao, your English is very good. Did you study abroad? No, sir! And if I told you I study in prison? I have to say you have a very good sense of humor. Please! Excuse me! We have some other interesting pieces, so, would you like to come with me? Excuse me! This piece here, was bought from an artist I work with for about 10 years. But I've never seen anything quite like that. This master piece is from another artist. Excuse me, who is the artist'? Hi, would you be interested? I'm very interested. In fact, I'll take all the paintings. But I need information on the artist. Of course! I'll check that for you. Thank you. Come in. Who are you? I just bought your work, I came to meet you. Want some coffee? Sure! Thanks. Where are you from? Beijing. And your name? Zhao Yongyuan. I know you. Anran! Long time no see. Won't you invite me in? How are you, Anran? I'm fine! In the U.S. you can survive as long as you work hard. Listen, Anran... It's late. I need rest. OK. Mandarin is becoming popular. People from the Mainland are becoming more influential. Today's client is a VIP I should personally babysit, but my Mandarin sucks. There you come. You're in luck, he should leave a lot of tip. Hello, Mr. Zhao. What do you really want, Mr. Zhao? I want to spend some time with you. Can we go now? Let's go. These benches are donated by someone. There are engravings on each bench written by the donors to their loved ones, for their loving memory. What are you thinking when you're sitting there? The Brooklyn Bridge is over 100 years old. What are these? Love locks. Sorry, can I borrow your pen? Yes. fine! Thank you. After all these years, why didn't you go home for a visit? After my Dad passed away, I've no family left. You said I was your family. I forgot. Can you really forget about us? People dream of coming to the U.S. but this is not our home. Let's go back to Beijing. I didn't like it when I first arrived. It felt like a forest made of cold metal. But as time went by, I see the beauty of Manhattan. You have to feel it. Just like what you see now, certain things are best left alone. Can you give me another chance? We can't turn back the clock. I'll ask my boss to get you another guide. What is love? Please tell me. Is it romance or torture? What is the consequence of a promise by two people? Pain. The world is moving so quickly people tend to forget waiting and patience. When you start to doubt me, the only proof of love is... Anran! How was it last night? Have fun? He's so handsome... and rich. I don't want this client. Can you send someone else? Listen to me, Anran. Life has been tough for you ever since you arrived. You're not young. Cherish the chance you've been given. He's taking you out to dinner and a Broadway show afterwards. He sent a chauffeur and made all the arrangements. I'm not going! Come on... Not this time, boss! No. This is part of your job. Don't ruin the companys reputation. You think Anran will show up? Please Anran, there you are! - Come over here... - I didn't know you're here. We're waiting for you. Long time no see, Anran. You're still pretty as ever. Excuse me, sir! What time should we serve dinner? Now would be great, thank you. Would you care for this? Yes, we'll take the '63 La Tache, thanks. Can you believe it? They got married. That's great! Congratulations! Thanks. Did you notice my dear Jinjin has put on some weight? It's the power of love. Old friends in a foreign land. We grew up together, now fate has brought us together again in the U.S. Let's toast to that! Good! I always thought you two would be the first to get married. We were just kids back then. Let's not bring up the past. I used to think coming to the U.S. I would live happily ever after. But in fact... In fact I'm doing quite well. Anran, what happened to Yongyuan .. Sun Yuejin! Speaking of the good old days, you bought me my first fruit candy. I can still remember that taste. Those days are gone. Back then I couldn't even spare a nickel for anything. Things are different now. You can buy my time with your money, pay me to dress up like this, and dine in the finest restaurant in Manhattan. You show off how successful you are. I have seen it now. Can we stop this game? I don't care about that! No matter how rich and how successful I am, I haven't changed. I know life hasn't been easy for you. I only want you to be happy, and tell you I love you. Anran! Anran Anran Go away! Where can I go when you're right here? Stop it! It's over, we can't go back. I have decided to stay. What for? Is this what you want? No. This is not what I want. I wanted to be with you. But where were you when I needed you most? Why? Whatever reason I have, I should never have left you this way. Why are you always following me? I'm used to it. Why don't you sleep a bit longer? You woke me up. I'm sorry. You didn't sleep much last night? How can I look at you if I'm asleep? Here, try this. Hot? Good. Can I eat this everyday? Definitely! How are you? I was up all night. I've been thinking... I think... I can't lose you. Zhao Yongyuan came to see me, I won't let him hurt you again. The accident caused vertebrae fracture at C6 and C7. The injuries sustained are not life threatening, but the patient will have difficulty walking and using his hands. He'll need someone everyday to accompany him to rehabilitation and physical therapy. The damage to the spinal cord from the fracture might cause partial paralysis, below the patient's shoulders, including the torso, arms and legs, He'll need time to recover and the rate of recovery will vary individually. Anran! Look, you lost all sparkle in your crying eyes. Don't worry! I'll get him the best doctor in the U.S. He'll be fine. I bought you some food. You must eat something. What's wrong? I can never forgive myself. It was an accident! I can't go on hurting people. I must stay and look after him. He was there for me when I hit rock bottom. What about me? I need you too. Fate! You believe in it? Fate? I believe this is our fate. I believe in this. It tells me I love you. Anran. Leave me just like when you asked me to leave you. I did for your own good. It's for my own good too if you leave me now. Promise me, leave me.

You should follow your heart, do what you want to do Go find your own happiness. Leave me. What's the matter? I don't want you to be unhappy. I'll always be there for you. We'll always be friends. Friends forever. "Anran, forgive me. Yongyuan" Anran, let's go back Beijing! You're finally going home after all these years! Yes, finally. Take care. It's me, Anran.
