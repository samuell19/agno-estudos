(chimes ringing) * Upon three pillars our men rest * In brotherhood hold strong * And if our founder's firm behest to live well * As he did long * With lights, good things, we shall be blessed * Psi Beta Epsilon. (record scratching) (upbeat hip hop music) (crowd chattering) Sometimes I like to just sit up here and shoot at shit. This one time, I pegged some girl through her window. Right over there. It was fucking hilarious. Remember, AJ? So, uh, Pi Beta Upsilon bid us, too. Pi Beta Upsilon's a fucking joke. They pair with fat skanks. Yeah well, they said they don't haze. [AJ] Dude, we don't haze either. If you don't haze, what kind of shit will we have to do? -Can't really talk about it. -Just sign the bid. There's a 100 other dickwads downstairs right now who'd fucking kill you for that. (gun cocks) What's up, guys? [Interviewer] Nick, how you doing? Have a seat. Close the door, man. Oh, sorry. [Interviewer] Welcome to Psi Theta Epsilon. This interview plus your participation in rush week will decide whether you get a bid to pledge the fraternity. Go ahead and say your name into the camera for the brothers watching at home. What's up, y'all? My name's Nick Forest. Nick fucking Forest. Oh, love this guy! Nick here is a total fucking rock star. [Crowd] 63! 64! 65! (cheering) (upbeat music) New house record, baby, new house record! [Man] Why do you want to be a Psi Theta? I think being a brother in Psi Theta would be fucking awesome. So you want to be a brother here, huh? [Nick] Yeah. You got what it takes? Definitely. That is, if you get a bid, right. [Blonde Girl] He'll get a bid. I'm gonna get a bid. [Boy In Hat] Well, we'll see, man. I've waited a long time to join a fraternity. Specifically this fraternity. I will do whatever it takes to get into this frat, whatever it takes. Now, the challenger! (cheering) (upbeat pop music) (cheering) [Crowd] One, two, three, four. [Man] What the fuck? [Man] Oh shit! (crowd groans) Be ashamed of yourself, man, you're a fucking clown. You are a clown. That's so gross, clean that shit up and get the fuck out of my house! That good? Well I've read some few things about Psi Theta. Heard tons of stuff about Psi Theta. Especially about brotherhood, too. Loyalty, things like that. Just seems like something that I really would like to be a part of. I really, really would love a bid. My dad pledged in college and some of his best friends were his frat brothers. I'm expecting to make some lifelong friends. That's really what I want. I don't know what else to say. I want family. Yo, Glass's turn. [Man] Batter up! [Woman] Yeah Mimi. [Man] Here we go! [Crowd] 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. [Man] Holy shit. That was sick, that was fucking sick. Fucking epic! That was tight, are you alright? [Man In Hawaiian Shirt] Damn, Chad, Mimi did better than you! Ah yeah, remember the time in fifth grade when she fucking pissed herself and had to wear the emergency pants? Suck my dick? [Group] Oh! (relaxed hip hop music) [Sophie] So you're rushing Psi Theta, Nick? Yes. Cool. You have a bid? Not yet. Not yet? Well, I'll put a good word in for you. I've got some pull around here. I'll bet you do. Ah. You know that I'm a senior, right? [Nick] Is that right? Yeah, and I make it a point never to date freshman boys. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't fuck one. (retching) [Girls] Oh! (retching) Oh! (upbeat pop music) (crowd chattering) Nick. Can I talk to you a minute? What's wrong? I'm not feeling so good. Do you think you can walk me back to my dorm? Not right now, dude. I haven't gotten my bid yet. [Mimi] Right, your bid. Look, I'm sorry you don't feel well. Can you just hang a bit longer and I'll walk you back as soon as I get it? Fine, whatever. [Crowd] Kiss Nick, kiss Nick, kiss Nick, kiss Nick, kiss Nick, kiss Nick, kiss Nick! (cheering) You know him from high school? Yeah, we grew up together. (cheering) [Blonde Girl] He's really cute. [Interviewer] If you got a bid, would you pledge? Yes, definitely. No question. In a heartbeat. Fuck yeah! Hey! [Anoush] Oh, shit! [Chad] Phi theta! [Interviewer] Last question. What does brotherhood mean to you? Brotherhood. Always having someone there to watch your back. It's about coming together as one. Being there for one another always. Beyond friends. It's an unbreakable bond that you have for the rest of your life. (crowd chanting) [Crowd] Cocksucker motherfucker, eat a bag of shit! Psi theta epsilon, grab a delta tit! Fraternity, brotherhood, together do we will stand! Psi theta turned this boy into a man! (cheering) (upbeat pop music) [Protestors] Stop hazing now! Stop hazing now! Stop hazing now! Stop hazing now! Stop hazing now! Stop hazing now! Stop hazing now! [Pete] So what do you think of Zac Green's death? Like it shocked all of us. It was, it was just a waste. He was really sweet. I didn't know him, but I know people that knew him. I mean obviously someone died and that's like a big deal but I don't think that the entire Greek system should be to blame. Why's the fraternity get blamed for this shit, man? Always the frat's fucking fault. [Pete] So if it wasn't the frat's fault, then whose fault was it? Who do you think is to blame? -It's his own fucking fault. -(laughing) [Interviewer] So as part of the Greek system, you don't feel at all complicit in Zac Green's death. I don't feel complicit, sir. He made a choice, there was a consequence for his choices. Unfortunately, his consequence was, -Termination. -He fucking deaf. [Boy In Red] And that's not my fucking fault. [Interviewer] You guys seem kind of defensive about this, huh? Why would treat someone like shit, actually torture them, and then try and call them your brother. It doesn't make sense to me. It's not about that, it's a brotherhood, alright. We care about each other, we're trying to advance ourselves out here. We're not wearing these letters because we want to hurt each other. We're wearing them because we're family. This isn't the first time that somebody's died through these stupid traditions. I think it was sort of an isolated incident. Yeah. It happens on every college campus. This isn't like an everyday thing. Since Zac Green's death, we've passed several strict measures to prevent anything like this from happening again. We're officially a dry campus now. Just so you know. Frat houses are on university property, so there is no drinking at any fraternity parties. I drank just as much as him last night. -Yes, you did. -Yes, you did. It's sad what happened, but... Business as usual. [Bandana Boy] Knock knock. Who's there? Not Zach Green. (laughing) You realize this isn't gonna change anything, right? (tense music) [Nick] I don't understand how you do that. I'm just drawing swirls. Yeah, but they have really good flow. Your mom has a really heavy flow. Fuck you, dude. (laughing) (phone buzzing) (gurgling) (phone beeping) (phone buzzing) (phone beeping) (phone buzzing) You ready for this? Absolutely, dude, are you? Hey guys, come on in. Head for that door on the left, Rich. How ya doing? Chad, good to see you. (tense traditional Japanese music) Gentlemen, welcome to Psi Theta Epsilon. Over a hundred incoming freshman wanted to be standing where you are now, but you eight men are the select few, chosen carefully to be this year's pledge class in one of the oldest and most prestigious fraternities in America. My name is Dennis Taylor, and I'm proud to serve as your pledgemaster. The man you see standing beside you will become your best friend for life if you trust me. The brotherhood does not come easy. The things we ask of you will test you and your faith. Now, they may not always make immediate sense, but ask any member here. This program works. Never speak directly to me. Not ever, is that understood? (pledges mumble) [Dennis] What? [Pledges] Yes! I want you guys to meet Zeus, our house dog. Consider him another member of your pledge class, to help you guys learn about collective responsibility, you must all take care of him. You guys have each been assigned a big brother, an active who will serve as your individual guide throughout the process. They are affixing your pledge pins which must be worn at all times as a symbol of your devotion and commitment. Take a good look at these three candles, gentlemen. They're the three sacred candles that represent the three sacred pillars of Psi Theta. The next time you see all three lit will be at your induction into the brotherhood. Everybody turn to page four in your pledge books. To complete this initiation, you must all recite the creed. [Pledges] "To instill among its men the sacred value "of true brotherhood, to inspire among its men the power of mutual trust, loyalty, and respect." And now we're really moving to the core concept of what we want to look at, and that's Arndt's idea of thoughtlessness. (speaks foreign language) We talked about inorganic reactions. Today we're gonna demonstrate the double displacement principle by combining ammonium hydroxide with magnesium sulfate. (laughing) I'd like to welcome you guys to your very first Good and Welfare session. And it'll serve as a kind of group therapy for you guys as you go through the pledging process. In case you don't already know, my name's Tim. I'm the president. I'm gonna serve as a liaison between you guys and the rest of the house. Liaison, it's in the dictionary under L, you should look it up. Make no mistake about it, this not gonna be easy. Some people in that are gonna make it as hard as possible and that's why we have these Good and Welfare sessions where we can all sit down, we can talk about it and work through it. And I know that if you stick together, and trust each other, that you will. I can't wait to call you guys my brothers. Whoever has the candle, has the floor. And whatever you say, stays here. Alright, I'm Bradley Fisher, friends call me Fish. So hopefully, you guys'll start doing that. [Spotter] Push it up, I got you. [Fish] I've been trying to get out of my house since like sixth grade, so I'm just happy to be here. Alright, I'm Trevor. Rush party was awesome. But what I love more than rush party is good weed. Alright? So any of you guys wanna smoke a fatty. Holla at me, alright. That's my specialty. Hey guys, little nervous. My name is Anoush. I guess I'm just looking for that bond that I have with my brothers right now and looking to expand that. My name's Brent. I'm gonna be serving as your liaison between poontang and the rest of us. Hey, my name is Rich. My old man was actually a Psi Theta, and he won't give me any specifics, but he's implied that you guys do some pretty fucked up things to your pledges. So, don't pussy out. Rich is my roommate. My name's Christian. I've heard that not everyone makes it through pledgeship. So I think if we stick together, if we pull each other's weight, if we hang on to each other, we'll make it through. What's up? I'm Chad. My brother's in the house, but trust me, the only reason they let him in is 'cause they knew I was coming. They know what happens, and every time it happens, it reinforces the behavior. The Bacchae is another name for maenads, same group. They're also called Bacchantes, followers of Bacchus, which is the Roman name for Dionysus. What's up, everybody? Name's Nick, and I'm looking forward to pledging with you guys and hanging out. I can't wait, man. I cannot wait. Hopefully, pledgeship won't be too hard, but I'm not even stressed about it, honestly, so let's rage, guys. (clapping) That's the sound of orgasm. (cheering) [Women] Delta Pi Kappa is our name! If you wanna be a Delta, just yell and it's okay, whoo! Feel it in my heart, feel it in my spirit. Who let that bitch in? Shut the fuck up. [Women] Feel it in my heart. I feel it in my heart. I'm pretty as a flower and I'm steady as a rock, whoo. [Men] Cocksucker motherfucker, eat a bag of shit! Psi theta epsilon, grab a Delta tit! Fraternity, brotherhood, together do we stand! Psi theta turned this boy into a man! * We want to party Psi Theta * The hottest guys here on the row * If you get us really wasted * Your minds aren't the only thing we'll blow * Anchors away * Goodbye to fucking girls * There's women to be laid * Promising with hard-ons * And to always make you cum (laughing) * With Deltas it'll be so much fucking fun. (upbeat hip hop music) (crowd cheering) * You got them other ladies jealous * Getting eyed by all the fellas * Shake it (crowd cheers) * Shake it while you can * Shake it like a milkshake and do the best you can * So she run it to the bottom, she run it to the top * She turn around and make that thing drop * Say she run it to the bottom, she run it to the top * She turn around and make that thing drop * I say she run it to the bottom, she run it to the top * She turn around and make that thing drop, make it drop * The dance floor, hit center stage * Yeah she like that spotlight * All the dudes just standing 'round * Waiting till that time [Sophie] I wanted to tell you that I think your friend is really sweet. Who? Mimi. She's a doll. To be honest, I don't think that she would've normally got a bid into Delta, but I gunned hard for her. And I can teach her how to enjoy the experience of sorority life and not get caught up with superficiality. Yeah, I think she can manage that one on her own. Yeah, she umm, she's had a bit of a rough time with some of the other girls. What do you mean? Sometimes she can come off as a bit independent. But I want you to know that I'm gonna pick her to be my little, so I can look after her, 'cause I know she's important to you. She's a really good friend. Yeah, so she's told me. (cheering) (upbeat pop music) Glass, what are you doing here? What do you mean? You didn't think I'd get a bid? Come on, you can tell me. (laughs) What? I don't know what you're talking about. This is totally not your thing, man. It's kind of my thing. It can be my thing. This is totally, I, I fit right in. (laughs) Okay, whatever. -You guys are doing it. -That's true. Plus we'll have a lot more time to hang out. Definitely. Delti Pi Kappa's been trying to pair with Psi Theta for like three years now. So, I guess it's definitely going to happen now that Anne-Marie and Brody are dating. Wow, you really know your shit. I'm all over it. Like white rice. Such a dork, dude. [Woman] Alright, Delta pledges. Over here for a quick meeting, girls. [Crowd] Delta Psi Theta homecoming! Delta Psi Theta homecoming! Delta Psi Theta homecoming! [Interviewer] Are you in a fraternity? Fuck no. I don't have the right skin complexion for that. I just don't feel the need to join some immature, sing-songy, secret handshakey clique. Why are we not Greek? Let's see. I don't know, there are numerous reasons. I don't wanna fucking wear letters on my shirt so people know that, hey, I like letters on my shirt. They're gangs for the rich. Who in the 21st century lives in a group house with 50 other dudes? Fucking gay. [Interviewer] We're doing a documentary on Greek life and fraternity hazing. No thanks. Excuse me, miss, are you a member of a sorority? I'd say that's a yes. Me, I came here to get my education. Can I get you to say that last part, just straight to the camera? -I'm here to get an education. -I came to get an education. I'm here to get an education. I'm here to get an education. Not to party. (retching) Way to go. Whoa, bro! Educations. It's what's important. Look who it is. Nick. How's it going, man? Oh, you know. College, dude. What you been up to, you been partying? You know it. Do you want to get something to eat? Nah, man, I'm good. How's mom been doing? [Nick] Might be a little better if you called her once in a while. Dude, every time I talk to her it's just the same bullshit. So what are you even doing here all summer, man? I'm working on a new film project. It's a documentary about fraternity hazing. When'd you become such a big fucking nerd. Look, it's a serious issue, alright. Alcohol poisioning-- Check the mirror, Pete. You party just as hard as anybody. Yeah, okay, but not because anybody forces me too, alright? It's fucked up, people are dying. Lots of kids die from alcohol poisoning. It's not a frat thing, it's a college thing. It's even worse in the South, you wouldn't believe some of the shit they pull down there. Whatever let's just change the subject. I don't want to hear about this shit. You hear about this new water torture bullshit they're pulling? [Pete] You gonna sign it? I already did. I am a fucking idiot. I really wanna do this, Pete. Please don't fuck it up for me. Trust is the first pillar of brotherhood. Trust is the way we get closer to people in life. Trust results in unity. Let go of your fear and doubt and learn to trust. Tonight, gentlemen, is your first official test. You will now each consume a live goldfish to prove your commitment to your big brother. (overlapping chatter) Blindfolds, please. Make sure you can't see. Just have fun with it, buddy. Open your mouths. Swallow it, dude. Open your mouth. Swallow it! Open your mouth. [Frat Brother] How does it taste, good? [Frat Brother] Swallow it, swallow it, swallow it. Now remove your blindfolds. Welcome to college boys! (laughing) [Frat Brother] It's anchovies! The method should be clear, gentlemen. Trust the brothers. -Now, what's the goal? -[Pledges] Brotherhood. [Dennis] What is the first pillar? [Pledges] Trust. -[Dennis] What is the goal? -[Pledges] Brotherhood. [Dennis] What is the first pillar? [Pledges] Trust. Good. Hey, what the fuck are you doing? [Pete] Shit, shit! Get him! [Frat Brother] Let's get this fucking guy. [Pete] Go, go, go, go! [Frat Brother] Fuck you, man. [Pete] What is it like to have the campus perceive you as a group of date rapers. It's racist, it's not fair! We're officially a dry campus now. No kegs, no bottles, no cans, no nothing. Any fraternity that we find even a bottle of beer will have its charter revoked. (melancholy music) The administration knows that with the Alphas gone we're the mad dogs on campus now. (growling) We've got to expect a spiked collar. (growling) They're bound to yank that leash. (growling) But what they don't seem to understand is that when they send us underground, it only makes us more and more rabid. (barking) Pampering's over, pukes. Welcome to the line up. (shouting) Fag. Fag. Fag. This puke asked me during rush week if we haze, ha ha. (crowd laughs) Think somebody got teased in middle school? (crowd laughs) We don't haze, Trevor. We torture! (brothers screaming) You're gonna quit, I can tell. (crowd laughs) (whistling) (murmuring) You seem to think it's, like, cool to be stoned all the fucking time, don't you, Brent? -[Brent] Nah, man. -Shut the fuck up! You do not talk back in lineup. You little fuckstain. I'm sorry, I-- (frat brothers groan) Unbelievable. No fucking respect. I just thought that you wanted me to-- Motherfucker! I'm gonna fucking kill you all! (crowd groaning) You're my grandfather's hairy ass balls. Look at this fucking thing, dude. Look at it. No, you know what, my grandfather's hairy ballsack means more to this house than your fucking gay ass. His grandfather's balls have been places, man. Now get on your fucking knees! Your new name. Pubes. (laughing) [Frat Brothers] Pubes, pubes, pubes, pubes, pubes, pubes, pubes, pubes. I'm gonna lay a nigga the fuck out! What the fuck's so funny? Who the fuck are you? [Fish] Fish, man. (frat brothers groan) What? Bradley Fisher! Who? (laughing) Shut the fuck up! Who are you? That's what I thought! [Frat Brothers] Munch, Munch, Munch, Munch, Munch, Munch, Munch, Munch, Munch, Munch, Munch, Munch! You are one ugly, beak-nosed bitch. [Frat Brother] You tell him, Munch! What's your name again? Anoush. Anus. [Brothers] Anus, Anus, Anus, Anus, Anus, Anus Anus, Anus. Which sand dune motherfucking terrorist country are you from? Iran. Well, my little Al-Queda Anus, every time one of us says your name, you say, I do not know how the bomb got in my luggage. Let's practice! Yo, Anus! I don't know how the bomb got in my luggage. Say it in the goofy fucking accent. I don't know how the bomb got in my luggage. (laughing) Pray to my dick. Did I fucking stutter? I said get on the fucking ground and pray to my dick. Now! Make this dick grow a couple more inches. [Frat Brothers] Ooh! Chad. [Frat Brothers] Awwww. [Frat Brother] So cute, family pride. You're walking around here acting like it's a given that you're gonna get in this house just because you're my little brother. And that's bullshit. These are my brothers! This is my blood! We earned it! So let me give you a little wake up call, alright? You get your shit together. 'Cause if you don't earn their respect, little bro, you're gonna lose mine. (crowd groans) [Frat Brother] Ice cold, bro. [Frat Brother] Damn! You guys seen this? No, it's all over campus. This faggot trying to fuck us over is named Peter Forest. Now it's come to my attention guys, that this little fucking cumstain caught us on tape without our fucking permission doing some illicit things. You guys know this puke's name? Nick Forest, Peter Forest's little brother. (laughing) Trust is the first pillar of brotherhood. You guys trust this guy? -[Brothers] Fuck no! -Let's kill him right now. I'm left with a little dilemma here. You see, we've never blackballed anybody this early in pledgeship before. Now I get rid of you, who knows what you'll do. I've decided to keep you in. I'm gonna keep my eye on you. But it's gonna take a fucking miracle for you to win my trust. Everybody get on the fucking ground now and do push-ups. Don't stop until I tell you to. Not you, faggot. You fucking stand here and you fucking watch. (crowd jeers pledges) I'm fucking thirsty. You boys thirsty? (cheering) Keep drinking, fellas. Nobody leaves here until every last one of you motherfuckers pukes. Either puke on yourself or your pledge brother. (haunting music) Ah, fuck. (tense electronic music) (coughing) The pulmonary artery runs to... from the lungs. Relax. (knocking on door) If this was a test, you would've failed. Coming. What's going on? Pete, we need to fucking talk? My little brother Nicky. -Isn't he pretty? -Fuck you. What were you doing filming outside the Psi Theta house yesterday? What are you talking about, man? How are you gonna be a pussy and lie to me? They fucking saw you, Pete. Why do you wanna fuck things up for me? That's not what I'm doing. Then what the fuck are you doing? What is it? You jealous? You have no idea. That's it, isn't it? Fucking jealous. (glass tinkling) Today's the day you're gonna elect your pledge class president. Your president's the guy who's gonna lead you through the challenges ahead and he's also gonna team with me in communicating with the brothers, so needless to say, this is very important. That said, does anybody have any nominations. Yeah, actually I put a lot of thought into this, and I came to the conclusion that I'm gonna say fuck it, skip all this bullshit, and select Nick. What? -I agree. -[Anoush] Yeah, let's vote. No no, we're not just gonna vote. No offense, bro, but I don't know you, and I don't know if I can trust you. You've gotta earn our trust. Don't you think your dick brother is something you should have told us about? Dude, I got two little sisters. Does the fact that I didn't mention that make me a suspect? Your sisters aren't trying to take us down. Dude, they're in like the seventh grade. They couldn't bring us down if they tried. Shut up. You're a fucking idiot. [Fish] Alright, well dude, think about everything we've been learning. What's the first pillar of brotherhood? It's fucking trust. Fucking trust, exactly. What a better way to prove to the frat that we trust him. That's a brilliant idea. [Fish] Fuckin A. You guys ready to vote or do we need more time? [Fish] Let's do it. Fuck else is there to discuss? All in favor of Nick? Come on, dude. Fuck it, unity, right? (upbeat hip hop music) If you don't win this game in the next one. [Trevor] Oh yeah, nice shot, bro. [Fish] Nice shot. Hey, what happened to your lip, dude? Some chick bite you? Yeah, crazy bitch, man. (laughing) [Chad] Come on, dude. [Trevor] Chode, you're worthless, man. [Chad's Brother] Hey, can I play after Helen Keller plays? (laughing) Word, boys. [Nick] What's up, brother? The first democracy was Athens. Athens Greece. What's up, ladies? Everybody gather around. Alright, guys. Tonight's year's first dance. The theme is boxes and blazers, meaning you wear boxer shorts with a blazer. Get it? Alright, so this is a spontaneous, which means you got about two hours to find a date. The buses are leaving here at 8:00, so make sure you find one and get back here on time. I got an hour man, fuck that. Two hours? Do you know a female? Not here. Fucking doing chores all day and shit. Yo, Nick. Try to get back here quick so we can pre-game. Definitely. Dude, do you even have a girl's number in that phone besides your mom? I mean, yeah. Aren't all your girlfriends like arranged and shit? (knocking on door) [Woman] What's up? Is your friend Sophie here? Yeah, I think she's upstairs. I'll go get her. Just wait here. [Woman] Yeah, but have you seen his ass? He's got like the nicest body. He's like her best friend. She's only taking him so her brothers don't find out he's gay. I think everyone knows he's gay. -The whole house is gay. -Right? [chuckles] Hi, Nick. Well, this is a nice surprise. [Nick] How are you? I'm good, thank you. Listen, there's this dance tonight. Psi Theta Date Dash. I know all about it. I don't have a lot of time, and I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go with me. Nick, that is so cute. I would love to go with you. I, uh, shit. I've got like two papers to write and an exam tomorrow, so I really just have too much work to do. I mean, I understand. It's last minute. Right. That's why they call it spontaneous. Right.

Whoo! On this list, you're gonna find all the activities you have to perform. (upbeat rock music) And all the items you have to obtain. In addition, there's gonna be some clues along the way. Got it! Plaster cast god of knowledge. What the fuck is plaster cast god of knowledge. Apollo, Apollo's the god of knowledge. Got it! -I weighed my dick. -Your body weight. You weighed your dick? Where the fuck are we supposed to be looking? Does anyone wanna jump in? -I think it's in the lake. -Did you find something? You must all work as one.

[Chad] I hurt my foot. [Pledges] One, one, one, one, one, one one, one, one, one! Put on these clothes, and go to the student government events production office in the basement of the union. Use the loading doc entrance. No camera for this one. Be discrete. [Pete] I wanna see more of these, okay? I need to see his face. So could you run off like a hundred copies of these tonight? I don't know, Pete. It's getting kinda late and I got a test in the morning. It's just a hundred copies. (loud thudding) What the fuck was that? (loud thudding) [Man In Mask] Open the door. There's been a leak, open the door. So what're you dickheads gonna do now? Haze me? (screaming) [Masked Man] Look what I found. Frat hazing footage. (haunting music) What are you gonna do? Stop it! (laughing) -(plastic cracking) -(woman whimpers) (laughing) [Man In Mask] Have at it, boys. (screaming) (metal clanking) (glass shattering) Congratulations, boys. Tonight, you've earned the second pillar of brotherhood, which is loyalty. Tonight, you've also shown me that you're willing to risk your own skin for this fraternity, and that really means something. Not only have you earned the second pillar, but you've also earned the honor to wear the fraternal letters, and for this your big brothers have something special for you. (cheering) (applauding) (haunting, melancholy music) Guys, listen up. We also have another little surprise for you. (brothers hooting) (brothers applauding) Hands behind your back. Gentlemen, tonight is also mom's night. Which means you've each earned a sorority mother to teach you the ins and outs of our sister sorority. And if you're lucky, maybe they'll teach you the ins and outs of something else. (hooting) * She run it to the bottom * She run it to the top * She turn around and make that thing drop, make it drop * She run it to the bottom * She run it to the top * She turn around and make that thing drop, make it drop * Dance floor, hit center stage * Yeah she like that spotlight (cheering) (tense electronic music) * Them chicks is hanging on Hey, Nick, Taylor wants to see you in his room. Nick. (tense music) Come on in. Do one with me. Mm, Nick. It must've been difficult for you, huh? Not as difficult as you might think. I wanted to express my gratitude. Let you know that you've won my trust. Nick Forest. I want you to meet your sorority mother. I think you two already know each other. Enjoy. Don't worry, he isn't coming back. (tense electronic music) Why would you let him use you like that? (dramatic music) Fuck! (upbeat hip hop music) [Whitney] Uh, Whitney Smith plus one. I'm sorry, you're not on the list. You're supposed to let all the girls in. Really? Well, how 'bout this? How 'bout you jump on my little scale here and we can fucking see if you're on the list. What the hell? Fuck you, assholes. Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye. (imitates explosion) -[Woman] Hi, guys. -Hi. (upbeat electronic music) (crowd cheering) * Take it off, take it off [Anoush] Fuck, dude! Fucking campus police is here. [Trevor] What? (siren blaring) Fuck yeah, it's the dean. Radio 'em down, radio 'em down. [Anoush] Shit, code red, this is not a fucking drill, code red. Dean's raid, dean's raid, go, go, go, go, go! (crowd screaming) [Fish] Come on, dean's raid! Shit! [Cadmar] Excuse me, guys. [Fish] Dean's raid, go, go, go, go, go! Get the cups, go! (crowd shouting) Get that cup, get that cup! [Man] Good! Close it, close it, close it. [Brent] Dean Cadmar. I need to see your president now. Yes, sir. We need Tim down here as soon as possible. The dean is in the entryway. [Brother] What the fuck? Help him out! [Nick] Yo, I'm really, really sorry to interrupt, but dean's raid. -Oh, shit. -What? Oh my God. [Nick] He's in the house. Okay, let me get that mouthwash. [Cadmar] Mr. Shankman, just the man I wanted to see. Wanna join me outside for a minute, please? Yes, sir. [Cadmar] Do you know why I'm here? No, sir. [Cadmar] Absolutely no idea whatsoever. [Mike] Not at all. [Cadmar] Were any of your members responsible for the property damage over at the student center? [Tim] Sir, I don't know what you're talking about. You understand, Tim, it's your ass personally if the police come back and say that even one of your members was involved. -Do you follow me? -[Tim] Yes, sir. I like you guys, okay? I really do, but after what happened last year, my patience is thin! Has to be, you understand? Of course. Is he out there? (shushing) [Cadmar] I've got my eye on this house, Tim. One stupid stunt, just one, and I will not hesitate to shut this house down and expel everybody that's responsible. Do you understand me? Yes sir. Am I clear? Guys, let's go. [Anoush] We're all clear. Yo, Nick, we're all clear. Let's get the kegs back out here! (upbeat pop music) * Welcome to my house party How you doing, bro? [Brother] Can I call you, Betty? [Brother] God, you're pretty. Guys, I think I heard him just queef. [Brother] Guys, I think I heard him just queef. Oh dude, did you just queef. [Brother] Tell us your queef face. -You ever see a queef? -Show us a fucking queef! (laughing) [Brother] That's disgusting, you're making me sick. Wait, wait. Do that again, one more time, one more time. -Don't do it again. -[Brother] Give me that Q face. [Brother] Don't do it again. I told you not to make that face. What the fuck is wrong with you? That's disgusting, I'm gonna vomit. [Snow] Drink this beer right here. We're not allowed to drink on post. Tell you what, you don't drink this beer and your ass is gonna burn in lineup, bitch. I said drink, so you drink, it's not an option. [Brothers] Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink! [Brother] You're spilling all over yourself, dude! [Snow] You fucking just drank on post! You piece of shit! [Brother] Yeah, buddy! Let's go, buddy. Love you. (upbeat electronic music) Hey, honeybuns. Beatrice? Bebe? Bebe, right? Bebe. Mimi. Mimi, huh. That's right, that's right, I knew that. You look kind of lonely. Like a lonely loaf of honey. You look like a douchebag. (laughing) [Killman] That's funny. But seriously, you have to, like, loosen up a little bit. It's a party-- Can I have a drink? Sure, here. Wow, you're drinking really fast. Here's another one. Here, here. Wow. Maybe you could use something harder. Like me wiener. (laughs) Yeah, yeah. (chuckles) [Killman] My penis. Mm-hmm. But seriously, would you like to go back to my room? I got hookah, got some weed. Let's go. (laughs) Right, you're looking for someone. No! And you found him. Over the lips and past the gums, I did your mom, dum diddy dum! (laughing) That's not even a cheer. I just made it up. That's a good one. (laughing) (coughing) [Killman] Sorry. (laughing) I'm sorry, was I crossing the line? (soft moaning) Oh, stop being so tight, sweetie. Loosen up. Fuck. (sighs) (grunting) (melancholy music) Oh, you feel so good. Yee-haw, rodeo! (Mimi screams) One, two, three, four. Gotta ride for eight seconds, Killman. Five, six, seven, eight! [Mimi] Fuck you! Oh shit! Oh shit, dude. She just fucking beat the shit out of you! Fucking cunt! (laughing) Shut the fuck up, you asshole! You did it, motherfucker! Motherfucking Killman, right, right? Watch my fingers. Wanna smell my fingers? Hi, mom! (laughing) [Woman] Uh excuse us. (coughing) Are you okay? [Mimi] Fuck off! Bitch. Eww, let's go. (sobbing) Fuck! Dr. Chorister, I'm really sorry I'm late, but I was wondering if I can retake the exam? Ladies and gentlemen, please finish up the sentence that you're working on. I need all the pink books up here now, thank you. I'm sorry, son. Was there something I can help you with? (sighs) I'm so fucked. I'm failing chem. And I know I'm gonna have to drop Myth and Modern Lit class. Everything's fucked up with Pete. I haven't talked to him in like forever. Pledge class is a mess and Chad's a real fucking mess. A real fucking mess. Dr. Chorister had no sympathy. It's like he didn't even know me. Fucker gave me a zero on the midterm. That'll probably mean I'll get booted from the honors program. Fuck it, I don't really give a shit. I don't really give a shit. Look, I know I've been kind of a dick. Kind of a dick. You don't have to be a bitch. You don't have to be a bitch. Stop fucking around. Stop fucking around. Some stupid pledge activity? Stupid pledge activity. Then stop it. Stop it. Look, if you don't cut that shit out, I'm leaving. I'm leaving. Nick, wait, I'm sorry, stop. (sobbing) [Nick] What the fuck, Mimi? It's just that stupid sorority bullshit. It's all so unbelievably stupid. I don't give a shit about pledging or the sorority or any of those slutty little cunts. I don't care about honors courses or anything except you, so what I can't understand is why you've hurt me the way you have. I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression. The wrong impression. I just want us to be friends. (sighs) You can't be serious. You can't do that, Nick. You can't sleep with me and then this. You don't do that to people who care about you. I know. Nick. I love you, okay? And I know it's just the temptation of all these hot chicks that are fucking with your head. You need some time to get them out of your system, fine. I know we'll end up together. I know you love me, too. I don't want to sound harsh. I think I need to be clear. We'll never be together like that. I don't love you. (sad music) Love you. Mimi, enough. Enough. I give up. I give up. I think we need to spend some time alone. Okay, bitches. You've been here for two months. You should have it down by now. Some of you still don't get what sisterhood is really all about. We talk about brotherhood. You have to fucking work for it. You've gotta hunger for it. You've got to lunge, dive, and bleed for it. This is the laziest fucking pledge class I've ever seen. You just might be quite literally the worst pledge class we have ever had. Yeah, and the laziest. And the fattest. We are the hottest sorority on campus. Do you really look like you deserve to be in this sorority? I will never activate a bunch of cocksucking motherfuckers like you until you learn the fucking meaning of this house. You know, we get that it's hard to stay in perfect shape with all the beer and cock that's flowing everywhere, but if you think you've got what it takes to be on this side of the line, then you'd better get it together. Stick to the one meal a day rule and puke your motherfucking guts out after every meal between now and Fall Formal. What the fuck was that? Do it again? Pretend that's your boyfriend's cum, right now. Do it again. (retches) Come on, Fish. History test, boys. Get a question wrong, you drink. Recite the Greek Alphabet. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, Nu, Xi, Omicron, Pi, Rho, Sigma, Tau, Upsilon, Phi, Chi, Psi, Omega. (brothers cheer) Keep it up! Who were the founding fathers? Benjamin Bradley, Thomas Maxted, Wilson Fitch, Arthur John Talbott, and Reed Harris. [Brother] Yeah, whoo. How many miles is it to the nationals in Houston? How many fucking miles is it? 457. (brothers hooting) [Brother] Son of a bitch! You're fucking pathetic. [Brother] 457. Now drink up, bitch. Fucking drink it now. (brothers yelling) [Brother] Don't you fucking puke. I told you I'd waste your ass if you didn't drink that fucking beer. [Chad] But I drank-- Shut the fuck up and don't open your mouth in line up? Are you 'bout to cry, you puke? (brothers laughing) Are you gonna cry? Is Snow being mean? [Brothers] Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry! (cheering) [Brother] How's that taste, Snow? When you go to a party representing this sorority, try not to look like a skanky slut. Okay, thanks. (snorts) Excuse me, Mimi. Mimi. Are you paying attention? Wipe that fucking smirk off your face, skank. I think Mimi thinks that she's better than us. Yes, I do actually. (gasping) [Pledge] Oh my God. Who says that? Well, I heard that a Psi Theta took your skinny little ass to the rodeo the other night. (laughing) And do you know what he said? That your pussy looks like a pile of roast beef. (laughing) Give me your pledge pin. Come on, give it to me. You clearly don't want to be here. Do the rest of you want to be here? -Yes. -Yes. -I want to be here. -Sorry, what was that? I said, I want to be here. -[Sister] Bullshit. -I don't believe you. Give it to me. No. You're not even Delta material. I only gave you a pity bid because you were such good friends with Nick Forest. Oh, you didn't know. Well, that is just precious. [Sister] Oh, she's crying. Give me your pledge pin so I can give you something to cry about. [Dennis] What are the three sacred pillars? [Pledges]] Trust, loyalty, respect. Wrong answer. [Brother] Nope! [Brother] Come on! You guys have been pledging this fraternity for eight weeks, and you still don't know the three sacred pillars. Tell 'em, boys! [Brothers] Beer, pizza, pussy! In that fucking order, faggots. Don't forget it. Groupthink, pressure to agree with the majority, to come up with a cohesive decision. The pressure to conform can be so strong that you don't look at new options or different decisions. Mr. Forest. (students laughing) Nice of you to join us. An example is Waco, Texas, 1993. [Fish] Fuck you. (pledges all talking at once) How many times have I had to take out the fucking trash? Shut up! Shut the fuck up! (tense music) Shut the fuck up, one person at a time. I got the fucking candle. Halloween party is Saturday. We need to figure out who is working what stations. We've all had to do everything at least once, so I don't wanna hear any bullshit. You're all gonna have to suck it up and fucking do it at the door. (all talking over each other) You don't think I wanna party, too? [Nick] Why would I wanna. (overlapping dialogue) Where is my fucking chili? Go! (overlapping dialogue) I'm really starting to doubt this whole fucking thing. You know in the beginning, the exercise with the goldfish, it actually was a good way to get us thinking about trust. Fish liked the fish. This line up bullshit. Riding on me, slapping me, making me drink. I took four forties to the fucking head. Pouring puke on us. I think the hazing is good. I think there's something to be said about it bringing people together. That said, maybe we should think about streamlining. I think it needs to stop. I really don't know how you can even be talking right now. We're not even done with this shit. I mean, honestly, we still have hell week to look forward to. (tense music) (creepy electronic music) My name is Linda Green. My son Zac turned 19 nearly one year ago. Zac shared your potential. He shared your promise for a bright, rewarding future. But this past April, my husband and I received a call in the middle of the night telling us that our son Zac had died. Zac's eventual autopsy suggested that he had consumed an obscene amount of alcohol, passed out on his back, and his lungs filled with fluid. He asphyxiated on those fluids. After we spoke with some of his friends and after a police investigation, we discovered some of what had happened. There had been a pledge activity. The old members of his fraternity made the pledges spin a giant wheel. They called this the wheel of death. Each Pledge had to spin the wheel and when it landed, they had to do whatever it said. This could be anything from consuming pigs feet and blood, to biting the head off a live rat, being savagely paddled or branded with cigarettes, or drinking a fifth of whisky through a funnel. My son Zac had to drink the whisky, a case of beer, and something called Mad Dog 20/20. Most claimed that in the chaos of the hazing, they didn't notice Zac lying in a corner. But when some of the others noticed that he was turning blue, they did not call anybody. Instead, several other members dressed him from head to toe. They even put his socks and his shoes on. While some of them, and this I find particularly disturbing, took pictures and videotaped. And as the abuse continued inside the house, several members dragged him out the front door, down the walkway, and tossed him, like garbage, on the sidewalk at the base of the lawn. And left him there. And my baby boy... died right there alone. The boys who confessed to dragging him to the curb face possible prison time. They clearly hold the most direct responsibility for what happened. It is still not clear who else saw what was happening and did nothing. And that is why I'm here today. I know it is my responsibility to tell Zac's story and it's your responsibility to make sure nothing like this happens again. Thank you. (tense music) Dionysus, the god of wine, revelry, and ecstasy. Wherever he traveled, he inducted new members into his secret, ritualistic passion cult. Dionysus commanded the following of a throng of beautiful nymphs called the Maenads. He favored intoxication, ecstatic orgies, and frenzied dances as modes of worship. Next slide, please. Pentheus, king of Thebes. In the Bacchae, Euripides tells us that Pentheus opposed Dionysus and his debauched practices. Repudiated his claims of being a god, and stood up to the dangers that this deity and his followers could ultimately pose. Next slide, please. Next slide, please. Entranced by Dionysus, Pentheus disguised himself as a woman and snuck into the forests on the slopes of Mount Cithaeron to spy on the ritual practices, captivated and enthralled. The price that Dionysus made Pentheus pay for his irreverence... Sparagmos. Dismemberment. Lesson learned, don't fuck with the gods. (haunting music) (wolves howling) (upbeat electronic music) (laughing) [Crowd] Chug, chug, chug, chug. We've got the man right here. Zeus! My boy Zeus. Hi, Nick. How's my sexy all star? Fine. (tense music) (crowd chattering) [Man] Beer me! Beer me! Fuck me. Can I help you? Hey, man, welcome to town. [Pete] Sorry, wrong room. Nah, dude, it's the right room. We've got extra. Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun! Yo, you in or you out, bro? Yeah, man, close the door. You're letting the love out. Sit down. Open up. I know exactly who you are? [Pete] You do? Mm-hmm. You're the twisted lesbian experiment I've been waiting for. (soft laughing) Come on. I wanna dance before we fuck. * No, oh * I want some bad * It's okay * And on my head (tense music) (girls laughing) You wanna fucking knock, man? Pete Forest is in the house right now. Where? Party room downstairs. Does he know we know? I don't think so, no. [Woman] There's gonna be a fight. (tense music) * Oh oh oh (ethereal, dramatic music) (fast, frantic electronic music) [Brothers] There he is! There he is, get him! [Brother] Get him, get him, get him! (crowd jeering) Oh, where you gonna go now? [Man] Get 'em ladies. [Crowd] Fuck him up, fuck him up, fuck him up! (cheering) I'm getting it, I'm getting it. Rooftop to party room. Pete Forest is out front, and he's getting the shit kicked out of him. Hey, Nick, Nick. I think your brother's in the house. What the fuck? Leave him alone, he's had enough! This needs to stop. (crowd yelling) Come on, bitch! -Where you at? -Come on! [Brothers] Psi Theta, Psi Theta, Psi Theta, Psi Theta! Let it go, Nick. [Woman] That's his brother. (onlookers giggling) Get the fuck out of here. (crowd member whistling) [Woman] Uh-oh. [Man] Oh, my God. (tense music) (crowd chattering) [Dennis] Move straight. [Brother] Don't look up. Keep moving. Alright, stop. Alright now, turn around. And remove your blindfolds. (tense music) Welcome to hell, gentlemen. (dramatic music) If you make it through hell week, you're in. (pounding electronic music) [Brother] He's got jizz on his taint. I would love to crack your fucking skull right now. [Snow] Say it like you mean it. Stick the dick and kiss the nigga. (yelling) [Dennis] Stand up straight. (laughing) [Brother] Line 'em up, line 'em up! Line 'em up! You gonna pass out? Huh? Are you gonna pass out? (brothers barking) (brothers howling) (Fish mumbling) (screaming) [Brother] Go go go! You guys did it, dude, that was really good. (applauding) Tell 'em about day one! What the fuck are you doing? (screaming) Hit me right here. Hit me right there, Fish. Drink, drink! Drink this shit. Just fucking hit me, I'm waiting for it. [Snow] What, what, are you gonna puke? I'm waiting for a reason to take you the fuck out of my house 'cause I know you're piece of shit. [Brothers] Psi Theta Epsilon, grab a Delta tit! (metal clanging loudly) [Trevor] Fuck! Fuck. [Anoush] I was having a good dream. (screaming) [Pledges] Trust, loyalty, respect! Trust, loyalty, respect! [Chad] How am I supposed to sleep with this fucking two feet away from me? Sleep. [Chad] There's human poop! Sleep! [Trevor] My stomach is gonna fall out of my ass. [Chad] He's on the fucking floor, man. [Christian] Jesus Christ, Fish. [Fish] Fuck you guys, man. (metal clanging) Good job. Do it again. (tense music) (brothers shouting) (fast, haunting electronic music) You're full of shit. What? [Dennis] Wrap that shit tight. I'm a pretty little princess! Say it louder! I'm a pretty little princess! I'm a pretty little princess! I'm a pretty little princess! (yelling) Want more? [Tim] What are you doing? (yelling) This shit is under control, it's fine. Oh, just, just. So fucking stupid. Come on, Nicky, you can do it! (yelling) Ah fuck! (brothers yelling) [Brother] You nasty fucking poop! [Brother] In the face! [Brothers] Oh! Chug, chug, chug! (yelling) (laughing) (dramatic music) (brothers shouting) * Upon three pillars our men * In brotherhood (gibberish) (distorted singing) * We pledge our minds and hearts to (distorted singing) (high-pitched whining) (static crackling) [Brother] Chad, you okay? Nobody leaves this room until the dog is dead. [Fish] Fuck. No one's touching this fucking dog! Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you! (pledges yelling) Fuck it, man! Are you crying? [Fish] No one's gonna kill the fucking dog! -(wet thudding) -(dog whimpering) [Trevor] Jesus Christ. What the fuck did you do? What the fuck did you do? (all screaming) Calm down! [Fish] Open the fucking door! Open the fucking door! Open the fucking door! I said nobody fucking. The fuck you'd do that for? I'll fucking kill you! (sobbing) (static crackling) Who the fuck did it? Who did it? Start talking! Faggots! He's speaking to you! Speak up! [Dennis] Which one of you fucking did it? (brothers yelling) Did you fucking do it? [Brother] Zeus was a brother! You did it, didn't you? [Brother] Answer him! [Dennis] You did it! Tell me, you fucking did it! [Brother] Open your fucking mouth! [Brother] Start talking! Fish! You know who fucking did it? Huh, you know who fucking did it? Tell me! Tell me who fucking did it. You weren't supposed to really kill him you stupid fucks! (laughing) If you do that again, I will kill you. (brothers jeer) [Brother] What? Ha ha, you hear what this motherfucker said to me? What the fuck you think you're doing? [Brothers] Get back in line! Get the fuck back in line, get the fuck back in line! You hear what this motherfucker said to me? [Brother] Take his ass out. Say it again, say it again! Say it! If you do that again, I will kill you. Do it. Kill him. (tense music) (Dennis choking) [Brother] Did you see that? Holy fucking shit! Fucking crazy! Back! Get him out of the room! [Brother] Holy fucking shit! (brothers yelling over each other) (tense music) (static crackling) (bell tolling) (sobbing) [Waiter] Here we go, guys. Can I get you guys anything else at the moment? Okay, enjoy. Mimi, listen. Nick, I know. No, no. I've been an asshole, a total idiot. You're my friend. (melancholy piano music) Have any of you guys seen Pete? Nah, dude, he went home. I just came from his house. Nah, he went home. * Ooh ooh ooh * Ooh ooh ooh * Ooh ooh, ooh ooh [Nick] Do you remember that kid that used to live in that house over there? What was his name? [Pete] Rick Grinder. [Nick] Yeah, Rick Grinder. [Pete] Rick The Dick Grinder. Yeah, that's what we called him. Rick Grinder. He was always picking on you. I remember. Remember that time he brought over that big old lost dog. Could have been a stray, who the hell knows. Mangy looking thing. He said it had rabies and would bite us if we moved. And I bolted in the house. I left you out here alone with him. I remember. What I really wanted to do was kick that kid's ass. I don't know why I didn't just kick that kid's fucking ass. 'Cause you pissed your pants, man. I mean, you had to go inside. You knew about that? When are you going back to school? I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Listen, there's something you should probably know. (intense music) Nick! Nick! [Christian] Yo, Nick! We've been worried about you, man. Nick! You're gonna talk to us? Dude, where are you going? Where'd he go? [Rich] What should we do? Go get Tim. [Rich] Yo, Tim! Move that couch there. -Where is he? -We don't know. Alright, I need somebody at every exit. [Killman] You weren't supposed to really kill him, you stupid fucks! [Nick] If you do that again, I will kill you. (brothers yelling) [Tim] Hey, Nick, you down there, man? (dramatic music) Yo, Nick, yo. Wait up, man. We got something to show you. Look, guys, I gotta get going. Trust us, man. Just one thing, and you can do whatever you want. (dramatic music) Congratulations, Nick. You're a brother now. (peaceful music) (dramatic electronic music) (melancholy music) (singing in a foreign language)
