我叫艾莉丝 My name is Alice. 曾任职于保护伞公司 I worked for the Umbrella Corporation, 世界上规模和势力最大的企业 the largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world. 我原本是高科技设施 巢窟的保全主任 I was head of security at a secret high-tech facility called the Hive, 那是个地下实验室专门负责研发 病毒武器 a giant underground laboratory developing experimental, viral weaponry. 不过发生了意外 There was an incident. 病毒爆发 A virus escaped. 造成很多人死亡 A lot of people died. 问题是他们并没有死透 The trouble was, they didn't stay dead. 控管巢窟的是超级… The computer that controlled the Hive was a state-of-the-art 人工智慧 名为红后 artificial intelligence: The Red Queen. 红后采取极端方式阻止病毒蔓延 The Red Queen responded to the threat of the viral outbreak in an extreme way. 她大开杀戒 She went homicidal. 你们全都会死在这地底下 - You're all going to die down here. - The Red Queen attempted 红后打算杀死所有人 to kill everyone, Down! 不管他们是否被感染 Whether they were infected or not. 我逃了出来，但这只是个开端 I managed to escape, but this was only the beginning. 病毒像野火般蔓延开来 Viral outbreaks spread like wildfire, 先扩散到美国各地，接着全世界 first across the United States, then the world. T病毒不仅让死人复活 The T-Virus didn't just bring the dead back to life. 还使他们产生可怕的突变 It mutated them in terrifying ways. 在他们带来地球浩劫的同时 Despite the apocalypse they had created, 保护伞仍继续实验这种致命病毒 the Umbrella Corporation continued to experiment with the deadly virus. 我被感染了 I was infected. 然而T病毒却和我的细胞融合 But the virus bonded with me on a cellular level. 让我得到超能力 I developed powers. 你的基因就是关键 Your genetic structure is the key. 我变得跟以前不一样 L became different. 变得更强大 Powerful. 无人能敌 Unstoppable. 在我变强的同时 人类势力也越来越虚弱 As I got stronger, the human race became weaker. 我尽力将幸存者护送到安全地点 I tried my best to lead what survivors I could find to safety, 但是我们不断受到追击 but we were pursued relentlessly. 就连我的朋友吉儿 也被保护伞捉去洗脑 Even my friend Jill Valentine was seized and brainwashed by Umbrella. 格杀勿论 Shoot to kill. 最后我终于对抗保护伞公司的首脑 Finally, I confronted the head of the Umbrella Corporation, 亚伯魏斯克 Albert Wesker. 他夺走我的超能力 但我仍然打倒他 He robbed me of my powers, but I still managed to defeat him. 我们以为一切终于结束 At last, we thought it was over. 我们以为从这场惨剧中活了过来 We thought we had survived the horror. 但是我们错了 But we were wrong. 我们又再次发现自己得为… Once again, we found ourselves fighting 生存而战 for our lives. 快，快 Go, go, go! 太阳晒屁股了 Rise and shine. 亲爱的快点，我们要迟到了 Come on, babe.
