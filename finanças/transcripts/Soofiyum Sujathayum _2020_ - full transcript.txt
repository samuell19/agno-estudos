Her love for Him Made Her the Almighty... "My soul..." SUFI AND SUJATHA "In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful" [Pigeons cooing] [Alarm rings] [Thunderclap] Praise be to God! Oh God! [Alarm stops] God is the greatest. [Chants prayers] Peace be upon you. And peace be upon you, too. Who are you? I'm Sufi. Sufi? It's faulty. Won't work. Goodness gracious! I've been here for 2-3 years... But except for the name "Jinn Mosque", I don't know much about this place. [Chanting prayers] Ever since the Badr mosque opened, people stopped coming here except for burial prayers. Since it's Master Aboob's death anniversary, A few Sufis might come in these two days. [Birds squawking] They are reciting prayers from the attic. God knows what will happen to them when this is demolished. They are planning to renovate this building too with concrete. The other side has already been demolished. They will bring this down after the other side is done. Then all of this will become a henna grove. It's the deceased who need space. I'm just blabbering... Where are you coming from? Have you come for the anniversary? I see... Have you come by crossing the river? This way, there is a new road and gate now. I didn't know. It's been 10 years since I came here last. Whose tomb is that under that tree? My master's. Aboob's... So... You are? I'm his disciple. Oh, you are Aboob's disciple... That explains... God! It's time for the prayer call. Shall I make the call for prayer today? Of course, God willing. If I can be the prayer leader in front of a few because of you, why not? Being Aboob's disciple, you must be knowing a trick or two. My prayer call won't... If you manage to get ten people, we're in luck. Are ten people enough? Plenty! For yesterday's morning prayer, the helper boy and I were the only ones. Once today's morning prayer is done, I'm planning to go to my hometown. You need someone around to talk to! [Chanting prayers] "Allah is the greatest" "Allah is the greatest" "I bear witness that there is no deity but Allah" Hey, whose is the prayer call? Perhaps a singer who is visiting. "I bear witness that there is no deity but Allah" Isn't it from the Jinn mosque? Ya... "I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah" What's it, people? Where are you off to? "Prayer is better than sleep" It's deep. Watch your step. Should have come through the bridge. "Allah is the greatest" "There is no deity but Allah" [Prayer chants] "God is the greatest." "In the name of God the most gracious, the most merciful." "God is the greatest." "God hears whoever praises Him." "God is the greatest." "God is the greatest." "God is the greatest." "God is the greatest." "May Peace and Mercy of Allah be upon You." Oh God! God! What happened? Lift him. Get some water. Somebody bring water... What's it, master? "Verily we belong to God, and verily to Him do we return." "Oh God, I have surrendered myself to you." "God, oh my Almighty." [Sound of ambulance passing by] [Indistinct chatter] [Indistinct chatter] It seems a girl around here has a rosary similar to this. What craziness are you saying? A Rosary? Secretary and President should arrive at a decision. It's a silent cardiac arrest. Isn't it? Do people need a reason to die? Where will we bury him? Yes, think of that. I'll go for a quick visit to my hometown. No, you can leave only after this. What should we announce? We'll announce with what we know. That... Inform that Shafeeq. Dear Shafeeq, why do you have to dismantle all of this? Don't you have announcements today? So what? Isn't this different? Hurry... Hurry... One minute. We should inform everyone of the death. Come closer. Sujatha's husband too. Dr. VR Rajeev? He has promised to get me a job visa. But he's not picking up the call. Dad, phone. "Shafeeq" Did you bath? - Ya. - Looking cute. Shafeeq, this visa matter won't happen in a jiffy. - You give me some time. - Not that, man! I've sent you a voice... Hello! Hello! Brother, I'd called you. That Sufi... You know - Sujatha's... He died during the morning prayer today. Did you hear? Just inform her. Brother, I'd called you. That Sufi... You know - Sujatha's... He died during the morning prayer today. Did you hear? Just inform her. There's a message. Brother, I'd called you. That Sufi... You know - Sujatha's... He died during the morning prayer today. Did you hear? Just inform her. "My soul..." "My gleam of hope..." [Door banging] "Verily we belong to God, and verily to Him do we return." Announcing with immense grief, the demise of "Sufi"... ... the disciple of Mulla Aboobackar alias Master Aboob of Mulla Bazaar Jinn mosque The burial will happen today at 6 o'clock at the Jinn mosque burial ground. [News about protest on TV] Reduce the volume. Reduce the volume. Are you out of your mind? If our daughter asks about this, what should I tell her? That your lover died? Do one thing. Get ready. Let's go home. Let's go and see him. It will cure this illness of yours. We can leave our daughter with Syed. Don't sit there like a corpse. Get ready! Move that pickaxe. Take that basket. The thing is... Now if there is anyone who doesn't know me, they will not be offended. Did anyone here ask your religion, Kumaran? Lots of people are going to be here, isn't it? There is a lot... The soil is very fertile. It's bearing fruits for the first time. Hey Moosa, what are you doing?! Why are you spitting on Master's tomb? He didn't have the fortune of eating fruit from this tree. This was the first grave that I dug. Here rests the man who removed my fear. You see this? What? I was afraid of even going out. Now I bury the dead just like that. Didn't he get his burial place dug before his death? Yes. I came to know that only after I had dug it. Was he really so fond of you? In fact more than me, he liked the Sufi. Sufi? Do you know that story? Which story? Mulla Bazaar... Come fast... Hurry... Hurry up. The bus is leaving. [Humming a Kannada song] Hey! Do you know EK Aboob's house? Clarinet... How do you know Master? If you are headed to the Jinn mosque, go that way. This is quite deep. Even the locals lose their grip. That's why I warned. Wait, Master's house is in Mulla Bazaar. You passed it. If I give a call to prayer in that mosque, can Aboob hear? Of course! So you haven't come to meet the Master? I'm his driver. We all call him "Master". - [In Hindi] What's your name? - Chanu. So, he's not an Indian... Kumar... Kumar! Ya... [In Kannada] The boss has asked you to come. Couldn't you have said I've work at the mosque? [In Kannada] Go say it yourself. Nonsense! There's a car over there too. May be to drive that. Always calls when I'm up to something else. Let me give an example for that. Is it another joke? Not a joke! No. This incident was in... Was it last year? Yes, last year. We had visited the Taj Mahal. Doesn't the river Yamuna flow under it? This fellow... I didn't hear. When Sujatha said it first, I didn't believe it. Only after closing this ear and putting the other on the ground I sensed it. Yamuna flowing... Quite unbelievable. Ears are extra sharp. Eyes too... She had cried at birth. What happened after that... ...I have no clue. Usually the deaf are the ones who become mute. What's the use of talking a lot. Isn't it, Nair? - I'm Menon. - Oh! Our role here is to know your opinion and convey it to Rajeev if it's positive. They were teacher and disciple. No better way to know each other. She is here. By the way... Where in the Gulf is he? Fujairah. Everyone is going to be Dubai people. What's it? The entire south is going westward. She teaches dance at Makkali three days a week. It's evident in the way she walks. Come on. Greet them. They're Rajeev's relatives. They've come to meet you. - Haven't you told her? - What's your opinion? She doesn't have a decision above my word. [Hums a song] Where did you take this from? This was from... What? Keep it back where you took it from. OK. Didn't you clear the bushes near the pond? Mom says she saw a snake there. It'll be just a rat snake. Pour some kerosene around. Fine. You do it, Kumaran. I get nausea by the smell of kerosene. Else I would have done it, Ma'am. He's a driver now. You can't make him do unpaid labour like in the old days. Bear that in mind. He and his family reside in our land. Isn't it more than a salary? [In Tamil] She has read some books and blabbers something. No idea what... Eh? This book is the problem here now. Return this and pick some stories. Mom.. That isn't what she said... That is exactly what I said. Hey, don't go out seeing Kumaran. Come here. Don't talk nonsense and ruin our good name. He respects me. Dear, did you have something? Will you be back before dark? Which verse is it? Chapter An-Nisa (The Women) When I ask verse, you say chapter? Kohl-eyed! [Parrot mimics] When I ask verse, you say chapter? Kohl-eyed! Wash your feet first... - Peace be upon you - And peace be upon you, too. [Exchganging greetings] [Distant prayer call] Praise be to God! "God is the greatest." It's him! My Sufi.. Take me near that prayer call. Hurry... Kumaran... Yes? - Where is Kumaran? - He has gone to Sujatha's house. Won't get anyone when it's needed. Where did you get this from? This is his call to prayer. Haven't I told you? Sufi, the master of all arts... Can you please bring him? Leela, lock that door. OK [In Kannada] Sujatha, Water is low in the river. Take care. "Hasten to the prayer" "Hasten to the salvation" "Allah is the greatest" "There is no deity but Allah." Praise be to God. [Indistinct chatter] - Peace be upon you, Master. - And peace be upon you, too. Hey, Khwaja! I'm here... God willing. My Sufi... Master... You may leave. - Where were you this long, son? - At your old shrine. Praise be to God! [Announcement in the bus] Anyone to get down here? Come on, fast... Where are you off to? I'm not going home. Need to go to the court. Tell mom that I'll be a bit late. Praise be to God. "Oh God, I have surrendered myself to you." Oh God! God has willed it! Show me that toe. Say "Praise be to God" Praise be to God. Pain is gone. One should say this when it pains - "Praise be to God". Thank God! His 'Rooh' is here. 'Rooh' means soul. She's the only dancer in this congregation - Sujatha. Teaches children too. What's it? Oh ya, Kathak. What about playing our song in this? He has brought it. From Ajmer. That finger is enchanted by Jinn. Now you need to go only for breaking the fast. What about the afternoon prayer call? God has willed it! Not just Muslims, the admirers in Mulla Bazaar are increasing. Nothing can match your song. Is it? Praise be to God "I seek Allah's protection from Satan who is accursed" "In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful" "Yaa Seen" "I swear by the Quran full of wisdom" "Most surely you are one of the messengers." "On a right way" - "Tanzeelul 'Azeezir Raheem" - Tanzeelal... "A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful." "That you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are unaware." "My Soul... "My soul..." "God is the greatest" "God is the greatest" "I bear witness that there is no deity but Allah." "I bear witness that everything begins and ends in you." "I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah" "It's through my beloved who is your messenger that I have known you and lived till now." "Hasten to the prayer." "Come, let us become one" "Hasten to the salvation." "Come, let us triumph" "It's another dawn! Awake! Prayer is more reviving than sleep." "Wake up and come. Sit by my side." "God is the greatest." "You are everything." "Like there is no you without me Like you have no one except me" "Come, let us become one" Sufis are... ...Saints who sing and dance. The real name will be something else. They call this time... ..."the grand bath" With hair full of oil.. Instead of this turmeric, henna is applied... ...on the hands and feet. How marvelous they look! At this rate, you will go bald before you go grey. You should use henna oil. No no. Those are planted over the tombs. Moreover, women are not supposed to enter there, except as dead. But I've been there. She won't have any big wishes. Just that it's someone who would appreciate dance. Mom... They are Rajeev's uncle and aunt. They were visiting a nearby temple and dropped in to meet Sujatha. If we came unannounced, thought we could see her without makeup. After Onam, you can see to your heart's content. Fat chance! He's trying to get a marriage certificate before marriage. So that he can take her abroad sooner. So you are not at the same place? We live in Sharjah and work in Dubai. I see.. Excuse me. It's that Baputty's son. All the documents are here. Your dad wanted to put it all in something and send. Please scan, copy into this and send. Don't open it. Take it to someone who knows it. OK. One moment. - So I'll be off. - Bye. He talks about some scanning. It's such a tiny thing. Where's Suja? Eh? Sujatha, your daughter... She's upstairs. Ya, give it. Her world is upstairs. Shall I call her? No need. Let her see that world. He has sent some stuff. For you too, Grandma. Come on. It's this way. Dear... I'm Rajeev's aunt. He instructed me specifically to give this to you. Your old professor. Here are some of his photos. [Sufi's prayer call from the mosque] We were visiting the nearby temple. So thought of meeting you. We'll go back next week. Henna from these tomb plants is said to be blood red. How old are you, Sujatha? I've never seen such a beautiful '22' in any other language in the world. If you can hear, why can't you talk? One day you will talk, Sujatha. When the black plum tree Aboob talks about bears fruit. God willing. Here... Move aside the book. Want this? Hello Sujatha, Remember me? During my research, I'd come for a seminar at Prathibha College in Mulla Bazaar. This proposal is through your classmate Shafeeq, whom I had met there. Looking back, I feel that the seminar was meant just for me to meet you. I wanted to ask directly then. Do write. Else I'll interpret your silence as consent. This is my company's diary. I have only 30 days of leave a year. The attempt is to find a match in that time. Waiting for your reply. Rajeev. What has he written? What have you done? Why did you destroy a gift? He'll be keeping tabs of everything. Doesn't he have a doctorate in Maths? Yes. Dr. VR Rajeevan. Not a physician. I know that. He must be a good guy, Ammu. After all, doesn't he know you? "White dove at the doorstep" "Heard it knocking with words" "Oh my soul" "White dove at the doorstep" "Heard it knocking with words" "Into me, a mere drop, entered..." "A sea that's you, My dear" "A sea that's you..." "Oh Lord! Have mercy on us." "Show us the right path. Love us." "Oh Lord! Have mercy on us." "Show us the right path. Love us." SUFI, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. "Heard it knocking with words" "Whirling around like a breeze" "Kissing between my eyes" "Filling my breath with fire" "You, my soul! My soul..." "The Henna grove winks with black plum fruits" "Mulla Bazaar opens a bottle of exotic perfume" "Parrots who chant prayers" "What do those darlings say?" "I have the answer" "There are many" "Slices of love, My dear" "Slices of love..." "White dove at the doorstep" "Heard it knocking with words" "Diving into the whirlpool" "Touching my anklets" "Glowing like a silvery fish" "You, my soul! My soul..." "Golden light falls on the Jinn mosque yard" "The radiance of love turns even pain into honey drops" "Poured myself into a page" "Worded myself as a letter" "And gave you" "Open it up" "A chapter that's me, My dear" "A chapter that's me..." "White dove at the doorstep" "Heard it knocking with words" "Oh Lord! Have mercy on us." "Show us the right path. Love us." "Oh Lord! Have mercy on us." "Show us the right path. Love us." [Performs healing prayer] May God be your protector! We've tried everything. He will be alright. I will pray for him. Thank you. God is the greatest! [Parrot calling Sujatha's name] "My supreme master, the exalted" "My soul" Don't leave. You know what a joy it is to see you. [Aboob clears throat] Master, I... I don't want this here. I've lost the strength to play anything in this. - Master... - Go away! If you want a companion and family, there are proper ways for it. "Allah is the greatest" "There is no deity but Allah" Peace be upon you [In Hindi] Did you see the moon of Eid? [In Hindi] What happened, brother? - Happy Eid. - Happy Eid. Peace be upon you. [Kids continue chanting] "My soul..." "Oh, creator of this universe. Oh, my protector." [Alarm ringing] "Remember life is so easily lost" "Life is as fleeting as a drop of water on hot metal" [Ramayana chanting continues] They say when you cut the mango tree, cut it completely. You mean there should be one mango tree per person? All these are beliefs. If just a branch is cut and the tree left, deaths are said to recur. [Ramayana chanting continues] We can tie two more sheets. One here too... "My soul..." It's from the guy who sings prayer calls at the mosque... What are you searching? Can she hear, Thankamani? Yes, better than us. I don't know anyone here. My daughter, Sujatha is getting married. - Wrote? - Ya. The groom is Rajeev, son of Thekkeppadikkal Gopalan Nair. Have you decided? Yes. Next Friday. Please avoid Friday. I'll decide that. Then you write. You don't need high literature to write this. She is my only child, Aboob. A speechless being. Don't start a "jihad" using her. Speak in a language I understand. It's written in it, in a language that only you people understand. Read it. What's it? People will accuse you and your community of trying to convert her to your religion. Which people? Religion is a person's view. Those kids won't change their views for others. This 'jihad' is something I don't understand... I know. It's a war to increase the population of your community. War is being waged inside their minds. If you can't understand it, how can you call yourself a father? You better get some sleep. It's called "Love Jihad" these days! What's wrong with you? It's love. Pure love... All are same, Kumaran. Sujatha had become enchanted by this Sufi's song. Kumaran, it's not a song, it's the prayer call. Ya, that only. Now we need to tie a sheet over this. For what? It'll rain. There was loud thunder yesterday. Rain, in this summer! You do as you are told. Water shouldn't seep in before the soil is hardened. - Your master must have taught you this also. - Of course he has. Tie it if you want to. Water seeping in or not, once covered the tomb is the world of angels. You know that? It's time for the burial. Hurry up! Hey you, Take that sheet. Ya [Airplane passing] If they've come to know about it, they'll come. Who? Fasten your seat belt. Ma'am, put on your seat belt. Wait. - Any help? - No. Hello Shafeeq. We've arrived. We are on the way. We will come there straight away. How far is the Jinn Mosque from here? - Will be there real quick. - Will be there real quick. We'll reach before 6 o'clock for sure. OK. Where exactly did you say... One moment... Yes, Syed. We've reached. We are on the way. Is my child okay? Message me when you're free. I'll call you. Sorry, what was it? Where exactly are you in Dubai? Bur Dubai. What? Another Dubai within Dubai? My sister is in Dubai. Not the Dubai you mentioned, but some other place like that. She had eloped with someone. Now living happily with him and kids. Focus on your driving. Sir, what do you do? At an insurance firm. Oh. Tell me, if this car catches fire now, will I get insurance? Switch on the AC. You can't switch it on like that. It needs a couple of knocks like this to work. Now it will work fine for about 20 minutes. Hello. What? Have you hospitalised Sunitha? When? You must talk on the phone when you drive, right? Sir, my wife is pregnant all of a sudden... Wife what?! No, my wife is hospitalised for delivery... It's a call from the hospital... Who are these people? - I've picked them from the airport. - Come out. Did he leave? Didn't return? What's up with this guy? Sir, It's... Where is your uniform? Because my wife is pregnant... Move him to the side. Out of my way. Who are the others in the car? I've picked them from the airport. Sir. We have come from Dubai. At 6, we have to attend a cremation. If we don't hurry, we will miss it. What's your name? I am Rajeev. Where is the cremation? At the Jinn mosque. Pay a fine of 500 and you can leave. Sign here. Thank you. Hey, you. Don't you want this? Sorry. - Leave. - Sir, we're off. In the eastern banks of Kabini guarded by Banasura mountain and Brahmagiri... Blessed by the footsteps of Ghulam Ali Sufi and Mullah Habeeb... The Jinn mosque where the supreme saint EK Aboob's soul was laid to rest... Whose 9th anniversary will be celebrated tonight... From 9 o'clock onwards at Aboob Nagar with Sufi music and dance forms... We heartily welcome you all to immerse yourself... In the musical night by the famous Qawwali singer Sadiqali Azeez. What is this, brother? Please reverse. I have to go a long way. OK OK. We will go back. Dear all, on the subject of "The path to afterlife"... Addressing you in the voice that is sweeping our land... The illustrious orator Master Shibukatullah Saqafi. We welcome you all to the programme irrespective of religion or caste... [Religious chants] "There is no creator except God." It's muddy. Don't lean. Move away from there. JINN MOSQUE Keep it here. I'm good, sir. I haven't forgotten. I'll be there at 11. Don't worry about the meeting. I'll be there. God bless you. Shafeeq, we've reached. Where are you? You stay there. I'll come out. Do you have any idea how long we've been waiting for you? Sorry, there was heavy traffic on the way. Shall we go in and see? Not possible anymore. The body is already in the grave. Do you think it's fair, Shafeeq? We've flown all the way just for this. We just need to see for one minute. Forget it, you cannot even see it for one second. Moreover, women are not allowed into the graveyard. Are you telling me this now? Couldn't you say this in the morning? I wouldn't have brought Sujatha if I had known this. I didn't know that Sujatha was coming. You could have attended, had you been here early. I have been telling you to rush. I am not aware of your customs. You must find a way out. Please. What can I do? I am helpless. Shafeeq, why are you here? They were looking for you. I will be there soon. Call you later. Who is he? He is Sufi's close friend. He has come from Dubai for this. Oh, you also come then. You can toss some soil into the grave. Shafeeq! Come if you want to. Sujatha can't. Come with me. They might agree if they see you. Come out. Why did we come this far then? Get out. [Religious chants continue] [Religious chants continue] All those who want to toss soil can do so now. "Oh God, kindly grant him the time that he is asking for." "Oh God, kindly give him the answers he is seeking for." My dear, what a surprise. You didn't even call us. Why this sudden visit? Didn't you bring the little one? [Song from Jinn Mosque] MASTER EK ABOOB'S 9TH ANNIVERSARY "Totally forgotten..." If he comes, you'll know from the prayer call. What are you searching for? Where are all the books that you had taken? How fast people change! God... No need. The fever will go down with a medicinal coffee. You have dark circles, as if your kohl is spread. What's wrong? You must sleep. Sleep really well. When you're in deep slumber, only the almighty will be with you. God is what you breathe. Do you snore, Sujatha? They say Satan resides in the nose tip of those who snore. Be it Satan, demon or angel, it can enter your mind only after you wake up. So, you must get some deep sleep. It's only when they are awake, people remember their own names. There is no untouchability when you sleep. Do you think about caste, religion, anger, sorrow or hate in your sleep? Not at all. Only the Almighty... All these are mere illusions. Illusions of the sleepless folk. Sufi's musical prayer call was also an illusion. The world is enormous. You can hear him from wherever you are. That's enough. That's enough, Sujatha... "Even longing has conceded its defeat..." "The void you've left, is quite huge..." Why are you going that way, dear? If you are going to the Jinn mosque, I can drop you. Keep the cycle aside. "You have taken away my soul from me, my beloved." "What will I do?" "Sorrow of separation is what this heart is suffering now." "My love for you flows in every tear drop." "I have become a river of sorrow." "You have taken away my soul from me, my beloved." Praise be to God. "What will I do..." "...my beloved?" God willing... Every bead in this rosary carries a story... The stories that my mother had told me. If Master approves, this is my bride-wealth. Otherwise you must return it to me.. Because I want to carry these prayers to my grave. My dear, what happened? Where are you going? If you leave us, who do we have? Dear... Let her leave if she wants to. How long can you hold her back? You are not that strong. Leave me. If you had a sibling... Your father was against it... Not because he thought they will be mute... If the next one was able to speak, he thought you may feel left out. Call her back... Move aside. Move. - Let her go. - Let me die. Please don't do this. Supper is served. Rajeev is waiting. You should have brought the kid along. - I was telling you, Rajeev. - Yes? I was saying that you should have brought the little one too. This trip was planned in a hurry. I had some papers to sign. And we'll leave early morning. Will she be fine at your friend's apartment? Isn't she too small? Syed too has a kid of her age. She will be fine with her. Look, will this cap be okay for her? - This is slightly big for her. - Just use a pin It will be perfect then. She participates in fancy dress and dance competitions. Really? Did you hear that? She also dances. That means she has got some of Suja's talent. Does Suja dance? What? Suja dances. She used to teach dance. I didn't know that. In the last ten years, I haven't seen any of it. - Darling, what's up? - Hello, dad. Dad, when will you be back? We will come soon. By the time you wake up tomorrow we will be home, okay? Here's your grandpa. Grandpa... Yes, darling. So, now you dance? When you visit us next, you should perform for grandpa and grandma. Thumbi darling... I'm sending you a cap. It's a bit loose. Ask your mom to put a pin on this. Okay. Grandpa and grandma will soon come there to meet you. Ya, we'll come. Who's that there? Your friend? Ya, we were playing on the phone... The call is disconnected. Oh, it's gone! Don't you have to eat? At least change your clothes. What will they think? Don't tell them the real purpose of our visit. Come on, attend it. It must be the child... Sorry man. Got disconnected. What's up there? Did you see the body? How is Sujatha now? Call me when you are free. Bye! The call had disconnected, and... That was a personal message. So they have come here after knowing everything... Your affair with him is well known here. While informing about the death, they said "Sujatha's old flame." For them, it's old. But here it's still... You must understand how I feel when I hear all that. Why did you marry me? You should've married him and lived happily. From where did you get this rosary? From where is it? Is it his gift? Looks good. Very good. You remove the wedding chain I put and wear this instead. It will be better. Where is the passport? I am asking you, where is the passport? Did you keep it upstairs? Are you deaf, dammit? Where is the passport? We came to keep these in your luggage. What was the noise, son? Isn't it natural for couples to have some minor quarrels? When the concern for the husband is missing, they tend to be louder. Eh. Why... Dad, I've never told you any of this. I have never been happy in my married life. I brought her to see his corpse, hoping I can now have some happiness. Dear, what are you saying... Hoping to get it out of her mind... What's it, dammit? Did I stop you? Did I stop you from seeing him? It's your fate that you couldn't see. I would've got some peace if you could. Dear... Dad, I've had relationships too. This is not love, but some madness. Don't use such words. I'll talk to her. What will you tell her? There is no point. I'll have to live with this. It's my fate. Rajeev, dear... Mom, did you see my wallet and passport? Wallet? No, I haven't. Passport... Did you check all your bags? I checked all my bags. I just can't remember where I kept it. Did you forget it in the taxi? I am not sure. Shall we call him and check? Hello, is it Anu Travels? I had booked a trip this morning. To Mulla Bazaar. A grey Innova. - Mr. Ashokan. His wife is pregnant. - It'll be in that car. I have lost my wallet and passport in that car. His... Ya... OK. Can you quickly check and tell me? Rajeev. OK. Thank you. Don't be tense, son. It will be there in the car. Where else can it be? I didn't notice it when they came. Do you remember? No, I didn't notice. Dear... Don't worry. You leave as planned. We will send it safely with someone. Don't talk nonsense. They can't travel without it. Only the passport is missing, right? He has the visa with him. Stop your nonsense! Hello. Sir, I am driver Ashokan. I dropped you this morning. Yes, Ashokan. Did you find it? I searched the car thoroughly. I couldn't find it. Did you search the boot? It's a brown colour wallet. I was searching all this while, sir. - Did you search well? - Yes, I did. - Sir, one more thing. - Tell me. - My wife delivered. It's a boy. - Oh, congrats. What happened, son? Got it? It's not in the car. Think calmly where you had kept it. Dear, are you sure the wallet and passports are not with you? Just give a signal if you don't have them. Ashokan, what's up? Did you find it? Sir, I remembered later... ...the purse was in your pocket when you went to the mosque. - Was it? - Yes, I'm sure I saw it. OK. Thank you. [Religious talk from mosque] "Two people will walk up. Who are they?" "They are Munkar and Nakir." "So, as Munkar and Nakir approaches..." What are you saying? Open the grave? What else should I say, Dad? My flight is at 7. I have a client meeting at 11. The locker key is in that wallet. I need to find it somehow. Else it will all be over. Son, are you very sure you lost it in the grave? There's no chance of losing it elsewhere. How can we pick it up from there in the middle of the night? I don't know. We must find it somehow. Shall we call Kumaran? Who is that? Kumaran is the one who digs graves. I don't know if he will do this. Dad, offer him whatever he wants. What can we give him? What if we return his land documents? Dad, call him. We have no other way. Please call. OK OK. I will be there real quick. - Kumaran! - What happened, boss? Rajeev has lost his passport and wallet. - You need to help us find it. - What? My passport and wallet fell into that grave. That's impossible, boss. You're asking me to play with fire. Times have changed. Better understand that. Kumaran! Give this to him, son. Dropped the passport in the grave it seems. Let it rot there. Kumaran, stop. - What's it? - These are the papers of your land. Keep it. I'll do you whatever you say. Just take me there. I can't do anything without it, Kumaran. I will show you the spot. Don't ask me to do anything else. "Praise be to God!" "The All-Compassionate..." "The Ever-Merciful..." "The Absolute Ruler..." "Praise be to God!" "The Pure One..." "Praise be to God!" "Praise be to God!" "Praise be to God!" "Praise be to God!" Come, I am your redemption and salvation. "Praise be to God!" "Oh. You become my rosary..." "The light of Allah!" "The light of Allah!" "As grief reaches up to the doorstep..." "I've become a rosary with its cord untied" "In the fire of darkness when desires possess words" "How will I, oh divine light, express my gratitude..." "Allah gives grief" "Allah takes away grief" "Allah is this earth" "Allah is my paradise" "Allah gives fire" "Allah becomes snow" "Allah is my joy" "Allah is my sky" "I stand like a henna twig..." "Near the headstone engraved with the truth." Dear... Let go of those who have departed. Don't think about those things anymore.. I have never heard Rajeev talk like this before... You too have a daughter "The light of Allah!" "The light of Allah!" "Allah gives grief" "Allah takes away grief" "Allah is this earth" "Allah is my paradise" "Allah gives fire" "Allah becomes snow" "Allah is my joy" "Allah is my sky" "How will I, oh divine light," "Express my gratitude..." - Which way is it? - There it is. [In Kannada] I'll call you. Boss is not keeping well. Bye. Boss... A man is sleeping inside the mosque. What if he hears the noise and wakes up? My hands and legs are shaking. If anyone comes we will tell the truth, even if we have to fall at his feet. It's there. Boss, you're sure it's inside this? Sure, Kumaran. Why else would we... If someone comes here and sees this, they will bury the three of us right here. We don't have any other way, Kumaran. Move aside, boss. Scratching like this won't help. Where is your passport and keys? Boss, I removed all this soil. I told you it won't be here. Kumaran, I'm sure it had fallen here. How can it fall inside this? - It may have fallen through that gap. - It can't. That is the body! - Kumaran, quietly... - What? Move aside, Kumaran. Let me check. Son! What are you doing? Don't lift it. Rajeev, no... - Boss, don't lift it. - Son, listen to him... Don't lift it! Boss! Dear, why did you come here at this hour? Hey, stop it. Move. Boss... Kumaran... Son... Kumaran, no! Rajeev, please listen... Hey, please don't... Leave me. [Indistinct abuses] Kumaran... Get off me. Leave me! From where did you find it now? Why did you hide it? What are you saying? Open the grave? My flight is at 7. I have a client meeting at 11. The locker key is in that wallet. I need to find it somehow. Else it will all be over. Son, are you very sure you lost it in the grave? If Master approves this is my bride-wealth. Otherwise you must return it to me.. Because I want to carry these prayers to my grave. So, is this why all of you got together and made me open this grave at midnight? Do you want to see? "Oh God, kindly grant him the time that he is asking for." "Oh God, kindly give him the answers he is seeking for." Who are you looking for? I had left a similar rosary with someone here. Long back... "You have taken my soul away from me." "What will I do..." "My beloved..." [Call to prayer] The seat belt...
