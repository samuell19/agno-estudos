1963 was born below zero, but it's the blessing of our temperature-- ...to the assassination of President Kennedy-- Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers? I'm the Doctor. The definite article, you might say. I'm half-human on my mother's side. Who are you? I'm not running away from things, I'm running to them. But there is a sidekick, proper. Fifty of them. Millions of people have watched it in 75 countries. - How's it feel? - 94, I was told. - Oh, 94. - Hello, Albert Hall! Stand back. This is my film school graduation film. 45 minutes of crap. More scripts. Oh! The very first draft of The Emperor's New Groove, when it was called Children of the Sun. Oh, my God! Floppies. - Do you want this? - Jesus. It's like I was on the run. I got the lid, 'cause I have the pot. Okay. Finding this in the query pile? This would be just like the meetings that we have, but with George Lucas. Oh, United States. No. Denial. Oh, somebody gave me that. Do you want it? Not yet. -This is relevant. -It's like Christmas. Doctor Who: Regeneration. This is all about my-- my Doctor. And, um, it's written by Phil Segal, and he says some deeply personal stuff about me in here, which is totally inaccurate. I was just a hired hand, I was a writer, who came up with a good idea, which was, "Let's have the Doctor lose his memory, and then have to try and work out who he is, and that will introduce him to the American public." Yeah, really bad special effects. That light's meant to be coming from his eyes, instead of him sitting up and peering into my storage unit. Doctor Who was conceived as a children's show in 1963, about a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, who travels through time and space saving people. And his spaceship is called the TARDIS, T-A-R-D-I-S, Time and Relative Dimension In Space. It's bigger on the inside. He's an alien, he looks like a human, but he has two hearts. You also can't kill him. He regenerates and comes back to life as a different Doctor, but the same Doctor. He's had about 12 or 13 lives so far, maybe 50, who knows? Depends when you're watching this. I wrote the Eighth Doctor, played by Paul McGann. Since the BBC abandoned the show, nearly a decade before, my job was to write a TV movie pilot with the hope that it would spawn a new American Doctor Who series. So we had Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor, we had Daphne Ashbrook as his companion, we had Eric Roberts as the Master. We were sure this could be a long-running show. But our big mistake was to make the Doctor half-human. The Doctor is half-human! No wonder. And we had him kiss. -What? -What? What? What? Two fatal errors. And it wasn't picked up as a series. I'd always assumed that maybe the reason he wasn't doing conventions was perhaps he, um, was feeling defensive about fans asking questions about the movie. Bad Doctor Who is better than no Doctor Who. Are you saying, then, you liked the movie? 'Cause if you didn't, that's fine, too. No, no, I di-- well, I'm aware that the writer's within earshot, um... It was recognizable as Doctor Who. I didn't go to conventions for a very good reason. I thought the fans would kill me. But my longtime collaborator and friend, Vanessa Yuille, encouraged me to accept invitations, and indeed, make a film about my journey back into that world. Now, opportunity had arisen, and I needed the money. People are gonna pay me 20 bucks for my signature. And now I'm beginning to wonder why I've never done this before. But also, this is the budget. So, over the next year, Vanessa dragged me to conventions in Los Angeles, in New York, and in and out of fans' homes. Be nice. It sounds like I'm the only one at the table here who actually saw your movie the night it was broadcast on Fox. Well, I'm one of people in America that did watch it, you know? We were hoping this was the birth, the pilot to a series, that this was going to launch us, that Doctor Who was going to be back. I knew that Doctor Who had been off the air, they'd stopped showing it on PBS, and then this thing was coming out and it was new, and people were excited. There was a lot of enthusiasm around the movie coming back in 1996, um, and people were really putting all their hopes into it leading to a new TV series, and I think a lot of people were very devastated by the fact that it didn't lead to a series at that point. It's 2005, and the Doctor is finally back! Christopher Eccleston stars as the Ninth Doctor, and he's ready to save the world. Since they brought the series back in 2005, it's just taken off. Nobody really expected Doctor Who to come back anytime at-- at any point in the near future. And then when it did, I think it was just-- it was literally the second wind in a life. - Hi, how're you doing, sir? - Good, you? Good. It's a bit posey, isn't it? I don't look like a dork. - There you go. - There you go. - Yeah. - All right. Good compromise. Put your hand down. The movie bridges the gap from the old series to the new series. And it's-- it's very much a forerunner of what Doctor Who has become now. This isn't Comic-Con. This is a very particular kind of fair. These guys are fanatics, but they exist within a special corner of American fandom. -Hi! Hi! -How are you? -Good, how are you? -Good. This is the thing, this is like-- I'm not a celebrity, I don't have fans, but somehow, in this world? I'm suddenly a guest. - No. - Here all on me own? Well, then you come back there. Right. I mean, it may seem like I'm a dickhead, going around, being followed by a camera, but-- but really, um... I'm-- I'm hoping to deflect it and find out about the fans. This is the best place to drown your sorrows. You know? They're 3000 Whovians, and lots and lots of booze. Ah, the American fans. They are the diehards. Balls-to-the-wall kind of attitude. All through medical school, I was still kind of the-- the closet Whovian. But, no, yeah, we're just a normal couple. We just got married two years ago. I'm special. Please don't hurt me because I am so special. This convention, Gallifrey One, has been a part of my life, my entire adult lives. I was 19 when we started this, and I'm 46 now. I'm a-- I work at a restaurant, I'm a food server, and I also am a teacher part-time, so, yeah. Ooh. Hello. And Piper's a baby. There's a whole community of people that do this. That knit specifically Tom Baker scarves. And we sit there and talk to each other and stuff, and that I found because this is what I did. I found myself working in toys, I worked in industrial design, and then I ended up in chocolate. So Anna and I are sign language interpreters for an elementary and a high school from where we're from. It's like, I will do anything for anybody, I wanna make sure that people are okay in their lives. -And I'm Andrew Skinner. -Andrew Skinner! And that's a good English accent. Oh, thank you, I live in Syracuse. But I'd say I'm the mad man with the box, 'cause if I had a TARDIS, I would be all over the place. It was very, very in-the-closet, so to speak. When we were growing up, holding a Doctor Who book meant "Please, please, punch me in the face." Um, "Please-- please reject me every time I ask you out." You know, it was kinda tough to be a fan in the '90s, because it was-- it's always been a niche program, but-- but even then, it was, you know, a niche within a niche. Doctor Who fans are the people that, uh, they-- the Star Trek fans don't even appreciate very much. But now it's-- it's grown and it's-- it's that freedom to finally say, "Yes, Doctor Who is a thing," whereas in Britain, it's sort of always been there. The Brits have been enjoying it for 50 years, and it's only been, like, the last ten that Americans have really caught on to it. I actually, um, well-- not from the States, I'm from Canada, so I think you have to change the name of your documentary The-- the fans of America, and one boy from Canada. Okay. It's like, this is our little TARDIS that's bigger on the inside, the entire world fits in here for a weekend, -and then we all go off again. -Yeah. I love it. Doctor Who has helped a lot of people find who they are. Beg your pardon, sir. "Doctor Who am I?" It's like identity. It's a line from the Doctor Who movie, of course. "Doctor Who Am I?" was the pitch that I made to get the 1996 movie. It's a very iconic moment. Um, it's a divisive moment. Some fans love it, some fans hate it. The Eighth Doctor just regenerated, and he's in the shroud-- the Shroud of Turin, as I call it. And he falls down to his knees, he doesn't know who he is, and he says, "Who am I?" At some point or other in our lives, we all ask the same question. Who am I? There haven't been too many conversations about where Matthew is. But that's because people seem to be more concentrating, I think, on the kind of Doctor, right? And-- and the stars. So, then you came to the States in 1990-- -Two. -Two. Or three, yeah. 1992, 1993. Are you an American citizen? No, I'm a resident alien. But that's just 'cause I'm lazy. I could be a citizen. -Um... -Would you be a citizen? Well... There's so much marketing. It's just, America is in-your-face with the marketing, I mean, everywhere you go, you're gonna see David Tennant's face everywhere, because they know-- they know how to sell things here as well. And they're just very, um, visual about it. Okay, Daleks have no gender. - That's right. They're pulsing. - Genderless. American conventions, you have-- you have fans re-enacting things in the lobby, you've probably seen groups of people crowding round Daleks and people striking poses and having photographs taken. That doesn't really go on at UK conventions. So what do they do? Uh... ...hmm. American fans are very enthusiastic. They like to do cosplay, they like to dress up, they will wear a t-shirt, I-- I did a couple of conventions in the UK, and it looked as though they had just rounded people up at the bus stop and-- and sent them in. No-- hardly anybody wore costumes, hardly anyone wore t-shirts. But here, almost everybody has either a Doctor Who t-shirt on, or a scarf, or something to do with Doctor Who, to proclaim that they are a Doctor Who fan. People come here because they love this thing that society says you shouldn't love as much as you do. And then you're surrounded by other people who love it just as much, if not more than you do. So, in some ways, being a fan is almost like coming out of the closet when you come to a convention. Because you're allowed to be who you are, and you're allowed to kind of experience the things that you want to experience, in-- in-- in the safe space that you can. We just have a couple more quick announcements we want to share with you. I'm forgetting many, many things, and I can't see the schedule here, cause I'm blind as a bat. Americans feel religion so strongly. Americans feel rights and freedom so strongly. So, perhaps, that's why there's-- there's kind of an unbridled feeling in fandom in America, too. In my opinion, the American fan is a particularly more virulent species of fan. They practically destroyed Mark Twain, Sherlock Holmes, or any of those, they're making them into cult figures. Oscar Wilde as well, actually, he did an American tour and had lots of fans following him, yeah. What did you want to talk about? Oh, I-- I want to talk about your movie. Okay, did you ever see the movie? -Be honest. -No. - Okay. - No, I-- I-- I wouldn't lie. Oh, good. Lot of people haven't seen the movie. Yeah, I don't have any hatred. You know, people hate RTV, people hate Moffat, people hate, with all due respect... - No. - ...your work. - Oh, hello! - How's it going? I'm Kevin. -Hi, Kevin. Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. And you've got the paperback version-- -Yeah, I got some questions. -Yes? We're gonna talk later about the TV movie. Okay. Writer of the-- the TV movie. 1996. Uh, first of all, you seem like a nice guy. Uh, the Doctor being half-human. Is that you? It was-- I wrote it in the script... -This interview's over. -...and then-- Yeah, I just wrote it off as, "Well, Fox must have wanted that," and-- and I just thought it was-- - But it wasn't Fox. - Yeah. It was this guy, I've learned this-- But what's your problem with it? Oh, come on, he's the Doctor, he's a Time Lord, he comes from Gallifrey. Ah, no, I hate it. I remember the criticism at the time was it felt like Mr. Spock. Cause Mr. Spock was half-Vulcan, half-human. Oh, yes, that's right, I hadn't realized that. So, maybe subconsciously -I was ripping off Star Trek. -There you go. ...and half-human on your mother's side is like-- is like saying you're really Jewish. Um, and there's a lot of references-- I'm not Jewish, I'm half-Jewish on my father's side. You should write a Big Finish audio drama and title it "Half-Human." We-- Yeah, it would be a big hit. It would be. Because everybody would tune in, you know? They will be like-- they will be like, "He has to hide his half-humanness." Just like, you know, in Nazi Germany you have to hide that you're Jewish. Do you see what I'm saying? When will you pay attention, you know? And all those people will think, you know, and he can't admit that, in fact, he's not totally alien. And then he turns around and he says, "Wait a minute... humans are aliens, too." Yeah. I have ventured onto Tumblr, God help me. These are people that absolutely flat-out refuse to watch any classic Who. 'Cause it's boring. And they just keep nattering on. "David Tennant, David Tennant, David Tennant, David Tennant." Do you watch the show? Do you know what the show is about? You know, in very broad, pretentious terms... you-- after Jesus dies, you start getting religions and rules. Now I will ask you, the Doctor and Grace, they share a kiss. - More than one, actually. - More than one! We went through decades of Doctor Who with no kissing, and suddenly, "Oh, look at this!" Well, maybe that's why you were persecuted in the playground. -Ooh. -See now-- See now-- I still like you as a person... ...but you, you know, it-- it's not to the George Lucas level, but a little bit, you destroyed my childhood. As I was writing that Doctor, I was pouring myself into that character. I was pouring my experience of the Doctor as a child, and all the wit and all the warmth and all that sort of love that the Doctor has of humans, I was pouring into this character. And I was loving doing it. I was putting myself on the line there. Someone wrote to me and said... "You've got it the wrong way round." - Yeah. - Yeah. - I would-- - Don't need as long. My Doctor, the Eighth Doctor has been mainly on audio - all these years. - Right. So, I've played the Doctor on the radio. You've been alive for-- as a Doctor, you've been alive for longer than any other Doctor. The longest and the shortest, it's become me. The idea of coming to these fan shows, it's just-- I don't know, no. - Same-- same here. - Creepy. Weird. Why would I want to-- I was invited on a cruise. Cause it had a kind of-- it had a str-- it has a strange reputation. And some of it's merited. Um, and I thought, "Well, I wouldn't enjoy that. Why would I--" So, I didn't do 'em for a few years. And when I did, I really did enjoy it. In a way, I mean, the simple-- I suppose, the simple feedback, um... it's just a pleasure. Oh, you got the script! I haven't even got a copy of this. I gave it to my son. This is the first time I started signing anything. - Really? - Yeah. This is a real fan book that you have here. But Philip Segal is the wonderful person who's really responsible for bringing... - Right, right. - ...the Eighth Doctor back. -Did you want me to write in it? -Yes, I did. Or did you-- what-- what did you want me to write? Well, there's this-- oh, there it is. The Jacobs script. - Jacobs script. - The Jacobs script. Dun dun dun! I don't know if you got the criticism, and I know a lot of people criticized the... - What, the shoes? - ...American-- no, the Americanization stuff. We were making an American film. - Yeah. - What can you do? - Right. - This. So it's 15. -Thank you so much. -My pleasure. Okay. It seems to me, that everyone connected with this show is trying to cash in in some way. I'm in the middle of the dealers' room here. There's a lot of rather, sort of pathetic, middle-level writers, like myself, and reduced us to a narrative work. They're enjoying the fact that they're getting this stardom. And I-- it's happening to me! I-- I feel that, too. This is the Radio Times cover. So it's all to do with identity and ego. And pissing contests. I think, "Oh, my God, am I part of that gang?" It's kind of-- little scary. -Nice to meet you at last, sir. -Hey, nice to meet you. You won't be coming to a dinner tomorrow night? -Yes, and I'll see you then. -With-- with-- yeah, yeah. All right. Brilliant. Thanks. Oh, thank you, yes, yes, yes. I just woke up. Couldn't be better, you sit at a desk, people come over to you, they tell you how much they love you, then they give you $15, and then they walk away. It's the kind of relationship we all need. A lot of people don't give me $50-- $15, though. They don't. -They don't give me $15. -Yeah. -They just come up to tell me-- -Well, they give you 25. Hi, I'm Daphne, an actress and-- and-- oh! Um, yeah, I wasn't gonna be here this year, because I figure, you know, you can overstay your welcome. This is Daphne Day for me. Daphne's introducing me to uber-fans. Let's have the camera cut that out! For me, it was just another kiss with another leading actor. But it was a funny kiss. And I'd never had a funny kiss. I make him laugh, and I don't know why. I-- so, I-- you know what I think it is? I think it is, I'm always gonna make a bigger fool of myself in front of people with him than he could ever, so he feels totally safe around me, because he knows I'm always gonna be the bigger idiot in the room, and it works great. It really works, and I don't mind. Yeah, it's really cool. We're literally-- I've got my script in the hand, and we're just goin'-- A lot of people don't buy a damn thing! -How are you? -I'm really good now! Well, what can I say? Life isn't complete until I see you again! They come up just to say, "Hi, how are you," uh, "Good to see you, love the show." I mean, I'm tellin' you, I have lots of people that come up, and I spend as much time with those people... -Same here. -...that don't give me a cent. I spend just as much time with them as I do with somebody who came up with, you know-- buying stuff. - Hey there! - Hey. I'm back. Oh, this is hard to find. And look at that. "No sex, please, he's British." No sex, please, he's Matthew Jacobs. Yes, okay. Oh, I was gonna draw a penis, but I don't think that would be good. - Maybe not. - Oh. Okay. - Sorry. - Thank you very much. And-- and that was totally inappropriate. -Nice talking to you. -Thanks. See you later. Nice talking to you. It's probably embarrassing. I was 18, and it was the most exciting weekend of my life up to that point, when I got the video. There you go, so I wrote-- I wrote... "To handsome Tommy D." No, wait, two of you together! The nature of obsessive, zealot fandom is something I'm interested in. Yeah, cause there are people that-- that's what they do. - Yeah. - All year round. - Exactly. - Every day. And we're cogs in that wheel... -Yeah. -...actually. You know, going to the conventions, -um, we're cogs-- -We're part of the problem, - are you saying? - Yeah. Yeah, we're part of the problem. We're part of the problem. We're enabling people. Oh, now you're hangin' that around my neck! I'm in trouble! These people are gonna hate me. Cut that out, Vanessa! - Ay. - We're enablers. We're enablers. Dude! Uh, it's nice to get out of LA. I'm expecting any minute to be shot. You guys are terrible, you snuck up on me! Hey, Malaki. Every fan has a story. Every fan has, um, an emotional journey. And the deeper you go, the more you see the kind of creativity of fandom. Wally knew a guy named Bob Mitsch, and Bob knew the Batman guy, which was, uh, Scott. -Who made this, Malaki? -Malaki made it, yeah. Oh, don't-- yeah, don't do that. -Sorry. -They don't move. Uh, but if you hit that black switch up top, it does light up. So we were already sort of in the group, we didn't know it, and then, yeah-- the circle started closin'. I told Bob, "I wanna do a cyberman, because I-- you know, everybody else is doing Daleks, and I wanna do a cyberman because I think I can do that out of foam." And he's like, "You know, foam, what's that?" And then I made one. The following year we-- we were starting to up it, we were like "Okay, we need a bigger costume, we need the-- the K1." So I made that in about a week. Do you think you're a frustrated -costume designer? -No. No, I am not. No, I am not, I am just a-- a very, very big fanboy. Hey, look at that. Okay. So. I want to be able to be that kind of person where, yes, I can be serious, yes, I can be funny, yes, I can be, you know, stupid, all at the same time, and still, you know, be accepted. There's plenty of research that ties the idea of play both to childhood and to fandom, and to adulthood. Adults play just as much as children play. We just have different names for it. We call it, in-- intermural sports, or-- uh, we call it a hobby, right? But it's-- it's still play. This is my own creation. - Yes. - And I'm basically kind of a time fairy. - Right. - And... I wanted to be able to make, um, -the Doctors regenerate with... -Oh! ...these, that I would be able to spin around them and make them regenerate, - and to fly through the vortex. - Right. A time fairy helps Time Lords be able to regenerate into their new faces. - What have we got in here? - Oh, I have Ross's head. This is the-- that's quite heavy. It's, uh, it's also made-- uh-oh, he's goin' for it. -Here we go. -No. I've got-- my head's too big, yeah? Uh, if-- if you want, I-- I'm telling you, it-- it'll go on, it stretches. Get the back first, I got it. -Right. -Yup. And then you pull it forward, there you go. Boom! You should situate, and your mouth will find the-- the little eyeholes and the mouth hole, so you can breathe. And thi-- these were cut out on the real one, so I could see through it. But wow. Yeah, there you go. You're ready to command the Daleks. - You okay? - Yeah. Wait a second. I feel strangely aroused. Where'd you get the money to do all this? It's expensive, let me put it that-- Uh, it-- it can add up. It depends on the costume. And how'd-- how-- what's your day job? Do you have a d-- I mean, this is your day job. At the time I did this, I actually did, uh, background checks for, uh, Uber. This was my homage to the gunfighters. Says, uh-- you don't see it, it got cut off, but it actually says Doc Holliday on the very bottom -of the original graphic. -Which was my dad. Yep. Yep. Doctor Who is present throughout my life, or my conscious life, for the most part, because it began in 1963. The same day as Kennedy's assassination, and I was only about seven. And my father was an actor. His name was Anthony Jacobs. He was in an early Doctor Who adventure with the First Doctor, called "The Gunfighters" in 1966. How're you proposin' to handle this little clamp matter? What is your way, Doctor Holliday, hmm? Where the Doctor travelled back to the O.K. Corral, and befriended Doc Holliday, who was played by my father. Oh, you don't owe me nothin', mister. You're my first customer, you have this one on the house. There was the mirror, you know, the back of the bar, and when they wanted an over-the-shoulder shot, they slid back the mirror and the camera would poke through. And beside that camera was-- I was there as, little ten-year-old. They'd given me a chair and in front of the chair, they'd put a little TV monitor of the selected shots. It was my birthday treat. And I had a set of cans, and I was listening to Rex Tucker, who sh-- who was the director up in the gallery, calling the shots. And of course, for me it was wonderful. You know, can you imagine, it was like being there with my two heroes. This was my dad and the Doctor. And my dad was the doctor. Even more confusing. Yeah, that was confusing, it's account of my fucked-up childhood. So this is around the time that I went with my father to see him shoot Doctor Who, and it's also trying to look very much like hero. This is my dad taking us on a small vacation, in a very small tent. This is when I was writing Young Indiana Jones. And I took the boys on set, and they met Sean Patrick Flanery. And they hung out with Indiana Jones for the day, so it was-- I was kind of doing for them what my dad did for me with Doctor Who, which was-- was very sweet. We haven't taken this camera out of this house, have we? Hi, Dad. What have you got there, Josh? -What's that? -This is my new pocket knife. It's got two blades, but, um, I'm about to carve Anthony Jacobs' initials on-- on the tree outside, after I've had one of-- after I've had a Pop-Tart. Well, this is my daughter, Piper. We named her after Billie Piper. And she's three months old and this is her very first cosplay. She just came back from her first convention, San Diego Comic-Con, we just got back from. And, uh-- so she did really well. She was on the floor every day, all day long with, you know, couple-- what, it's what, 75,000 people a day, something like that? All the white noise, all the people together kind of kept her soothed, -so, uh-- -She slept through a lot of it. Yeah, she slept through a lot. But she cosplayed every day. This is all new for us. We've only been doing it for what, - two years? - Two, three years. Yeah, the cos-- the cosplay aspect. It kind of jumped on us. I made a costume for Halloween, and happened to wear it to WonderCon. And it was such a hit that we kind of went with it, and then it just expanded from there. Her dress is really what got us invited to Graham Norton. I'm just gonna rest it on my head, if that's safe. What-- what that looks like? At San Diego, I literally ran into Matt Smith in a hotel lobby. I was gonna have this-- a tattoo project. We picked the elbow, which, thanks Matt, I don't know if you've ever had your elbow tattooed. Where's-- where's that? That's big. The original idea was that I was gonna do the TARDIS sleeve, and then if I ever happened to run into David, there's a blank space in the middle of the vortex there for his signature. And this one's very readable, - Peter Capaldi-- - Yeah, well, it's also the newest, so it's-- it's, uh-- Oh, that's why it's so sharp. We talk about the Doctor Who in you, but you don't have a Doctor Who in you, - you have a Doctor Who on you. - And all over me. - Yeah. - All over you. Yeah, so I have-- I have every Doctor except for Chris Eccleston right now. As a married couple, it's-- for me, anyway, I found that it's been important to, you know, when we find something we're both interested in, -to, like, hang on to that... -Exploit it. ...and not let it go, ever. Um, cause it's really, you know, strengthened our relationship considerably. I feel like I'm just-- I'm just a huge fan that loves this show, and brought me so much joy in my life, and in our home. Just like he brings joy to me! I just got married last year. Had a big fat gay wedding, and when we walked into the reception, it was like... ...kind of disco thing, and everybody was just on the floor. They're like, "Yes, finally, finally." Finally! Oh, my God! Come in this house! - Aww. - Look who's here. - Great to see you. - I'm in love with being married. We've been together, now, almost 30 years, and, uh, I've learned how to really do this job of being the husband. - True. - And I like it. We've been in, I don't know, two dozen movies together. We love working together. And we-- we're gonna do a count once of how many times we've killed each other in various shows. Here's my relationship to conventions. I go 'cause she tells me to go for the fans. And I had the best time! I-- I effectively have fun, because of the fans are havin' a great time, and they're dedicated! I think what's interesting about Doctor Who fandom is it fills this hole of belief structure, that religion used to do. The Doctor's belief of the attempt of non-violence, the bravery, and so, you know you can meet the right person and you know that the people in the room are the right people because they share your values. Fandom can be kind of religious. Mm-hmm. And religion can be sought by the fans of that situation, which-- just weird. There is a worship thing that goes on, there's no question about it. But I think that you can find that in a million places. Amen. You know, we met the keeper of the Holy Grail? There's a lot of people who have memorabilia from shows, not just-- you know, not just Doctor Who, that are very-- like, this is mine. You know, uh, I-- I don't feel that way, I-- I-- I think it's-- the responsibility is to share. So, like, dynamic. This is the only TARDIS console in the United States. And it's one of the only ones in existence. I understand what that means. When we had the Doctor Who movie reunion at the Gallifrey Convention, Phil Segal was there. He thought it had been destroyed. And he was really emotionally touched by the fact that somebody had saved it, and somebody had restored it. He looked down and he said, "Oh, you know, I see you guys built a replica of the Doctor's bag. You know, I have the original one." And I'm like, "Oh, wow, that's great." He goes, "You know what? I-- I want you to come to my place, and I'm gonna give you some of the props I have left over from the show, 'cause I want you-- I want 'em to be with the console, I want you to sort of be in charge of that. Be a curator of, sort of, the Doctor Who movie." Which, of course, you know, I'm sitting there going, "Hmm. That would be wonderful." And inside I'm going, "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!" We're outside Philip Segal's office. And Philip is now a major reality TV CEO, and so we've decided to out-real the reality... TV guy. I'm really hoping this is good. I'm obviously incredibly excited to see him, um, after all this time. A little trepidatious as well. He completely distanced himself from the script. I see all of the things that I wish I could've done better, or wanted to change, or weren't supposed to be the way they are. We sadly were in a time where we weren't allowed to make the script as fantastic as it could have been. Hey there. - How are you-- - I'm good. It's Matthew Jacobs for Philip Segal. Okay, let me call him. He's probably the number one American fan. Without him, there would be no Doctor Who. He is the reason, in my mind, that Doctor Who has stayed alive. Philip, Matthew's here for you. - Oh, my God. - Hello, darling. - How are you? - Nice to see you. Good to see you. You look terrific. -You haven't changed -Same to you. -Well, maybe we both... -You, you got taller. ...few little gray hairs. -Yeah. -It's the aggravation. -Why, it is. -How are you? -I'm good. You've got taller. -Have I? No, either that, or I got smaller. Better posture, I think. No, I think it's better posture. -I think it is. -Oh, my God, what an operation. Yeah, that was a gift from Discovery Channel. For, uh, shall we call Deadliest Catch. Well, we did a show called Ax Men, and we've been doing it for eight years now. We do a show called -Ice Road Truckers. -Right. I mean, who knew you could do a show about men sitting in a truck driving at 15 miles an hour for 15 hours at a time, doing nothing? -You did. -We did. This was a gift from the BBC. If you pull the top up, it used to have a lighter in it. We saw a Dalek that had a baby in the middle there-- -Oh, right. -Don't know -if you have seen that one. -Yeah. -No, but a real baby. -Oh, right. Look at this. It's got a wonderful detail. Look at the, uh, the face. He looks a little crazy. -Yes. -Yeah. -No, you sit there. -All right. I'll sit there. This is your thing. Yeah. I haven't seen you in 20 years. Almost 20 years. -96. Yeah. -Yeah. I'm left with an image in my mind. -Yeah. -And you're left with an image in your mind, of a thinner Matthew -who probably wore glasses, so-- -Well, yes, you did. - You wore glasses. - Yeah. And, um, but you always had that impish smile, and... you looked curious at the world. - I was impish? - Oh, yeah. Absolutely. On The Seven-Year Itch, you said-- oh-- you said, "Oh, Matthew, he's mad, he's completely mad, he's totally mad." And I was thinking of it, "Was I really mad?" No, was I insane? I-- no, looking back on it now, that wasn't a fair statement. It wasn't mad. It was passionate. - Driven. - Passion, yeah, yeah. And, um, you-- you were really driven by what you saw in your head. - Right. - Everything, you saw everything - in pictures, I think. - Yeah. Everything was images in your head, and you wanted to express that. When Doctor Who came out, when our movie came out, right, I felt as though I just-- it was like, even though there was some nice reviews... -Mmm. -...people universally -went after the script. -Yes. People would say, "Lovely movie. Shame about the script." -Yes. -And they would say-- They were gonna say that about any script. Any script. Uh, I was at a convention in Chicago... -Yeah. -...uh, right after it first came out, they flew me out there and all this stuff, but I got physically assaulted by someone who was so angry at the idea that the Doctor would kiss anyone. I mean, I-- yeah, it was physically, I thought he was going to hu-- - I was very scared. - Yes. It was a very bizarre moment. But-- yeah, I wanted to do the kiss. -Didn't you? It was like-- -Of course. I mean, the-- the whole idea was we were doing a more romantic Doctor. Well, he w-- and he w-- he was half-human. Exactly. That's why if he kisses somebody, then he no longer belongs to everybody, does he? -He belongs to someone. -That's right. That's right. That-- but, but it's cool now, because there are-- -there are women involved. -That's right. There are girls involved. And so now you can be romantic. -Yeah. Exactly. But it's all-- -But before, -it was an anorak boys thing. -That's right. And all the anorak boys things were-- they were useless at chatting up girls, -and they had this hero. -Exactly. This guy who couldn't get laid, and they went, "Yay, he's just like me, -he can't get laid!" -Exactly. We-- he'll never kiss anyone, I don't know-- Exactly, I'm not in the club anymore. If you really don't understand what Doctor Who is, the essence of it-- and I think most people who are not rabid fans, or fans, or-- or really are into the, sort of, the-- the universe of it. -Right. -You would n-- you'll never understand what Doctor Who really means -inside to us. -Right. Right. I'm probably not a fan. I'm kind of closer, in a way, close enough so that I don't have to be a fan. - Does that make sense? - No. I feel, um-- I feel-- it's-- I feel like, uh, I don't want to regard myself as a fan. A fan is somebody who's slightly outside of the main thing. Um, uh, and they've-- they worship it. I'd rather be the one who's worshipped. Okay. Worshipped or blamed or... I think at the end of the day, probably both. Let's see. You could-- it's very hard to see it, Greg, but-- can I show it, Dad? - Yeah. - AJ. - Yes. - Initial here first. Anthony Jacobs. - My grandfather. - Yeah. My dad was a big nerd. That definitely rubbed off on me, and it was Star Trek. But I'm a nerd. I like science. Tech. So, I like the show. I think it's a fun show. Shall we? All right. Let's break her down! Here we go! But you've already gotten this door off. Good. Is it a healthy thing? Where everybody's just running away from the problems in their life? And to a degree... I feel as though I've done that by being a writer. Down she comes! I think, as a writer, I've run away from my real life. And I live in fantasyland that my great characters are going to, you know, be fantastic. Doctor Who ends up affecting your entire life. My TARDIS is nine foot tall, 1100 pounds, and she flatpacks into a trailer, and then I drive her literally from coast to coast. She is the United States' only bicoastal TARDIS. You know what, she's a very interesting person. She shows up at these events, and she brings that TARDIS, and I helped her disassemble that thing last year, after LI Who Two. And I'm gonna kind of avoid it this year. I hope she gets some volunteers. It's a lot of work! I can't believe she does that. During the summers, I'm a herpetologist, and I show schoolchildren that snakes are not the monsters they're made out to be, and... that, to me, is part of the Doctor. I mean, he tries to make everybody get along, you know? Let's-- let's-- let's embrace each other's differences. Let's not, you know, be petrified of people because they're different. We can all find our place. - Oh. - Yeah. So the Eighth is this guy right here. Oh, there you go. When the Doctor gets regenerated, is there a little regeneration going on -for the sonic screwdriver? -No. No. Not at all. Well, maybe the TARDIS is the Doctor. Whoo. Interesting. Like, one day he'll actually become the TARDIS in a later regeneration? What do you think? -What do you think, Kev? -You know, any-- Bob, I think it's all right to tell him he's wrong. It's all right to tell him he-- It's all right to tell him he's wrong. The TARDIS is not the Doctor, what's the matter with you? Brains locked. Eyes locked. Eyes locked. No one distract me. Go back. -What's that? -I feel like I'm missing something. It's silly. It's the Doctor. It's Doctor Who, you know? It's-- it's just a story. They're moving so slowly, I still know who towed me. Hey. The-- Stop it! The improv punctures all of that pomposity and self-importance that seems to be attached to really appreciating this piece of science fiction, which at the end of the day, is a piece of fun. Doc meets the Doc! You play your father, and we'll be different Doctors. Yes, that's good. Yes, okay, bring the light here. Hold hands. Okay. We're reaching out. How would you like to see a companion die? - Just trying to pick up a... - A signal? You picking up a vibe yet? Sorry, I was squeezing too hard. No, no, don't squeeze too hard. Immediately become a sonic screwdriver? No! No! No! I-- no, you-- It's me. Matthew Waterhouse. I played Adric. Remember me? Is it-- which companion is it? That's his-- I was the, uh, last companion, uh, for Tom Baker, I was in the spaceship that, uh, ended up being the meteor that, uh, killed the dinosaurs. So I'm important to history as well. So if anyone has any more questions for old Matthew Waterhouse, I'm right here. So why would you channel Matthew Waterson? I have no idea who he is. Well... because that's just it. - That's just it. - He's-- He's kind of a bleak guy who thinks a lot of himself, - kind of like me, you mean. - Yeah. Yes, you're being insulting. Okay. All right, this improv is over. But I had some great Keith Moon stuff going on about Matthew Waterhouse. Perfect. Do you feel like you're getting into character? I-- I am, yeah. - Do you enjoy it? - No. What, this? Oh, it makes me feel very, very old. You're just getting into character. Makes me feel-- well, everybody has their own personal Death following them. Sure. Yeah. -Mm-hmm. -That's right. So one day, I'll walk around the corner, and I'll meet a version of me like this. -Like this? -Yes, wearing that and saying, "Hello. Your time has come, Matthew." And no regenerations for us, right? No regenerations, no. I think-- I don't think so. I wanted you to read some of these letters that you got. Oh, yes, this was a nice little letter, round from the '90s, from my son. "Dear Dad, your love and humor touches the hearts of everyone and you are a man who doesn't need description to make you strong, because those men are weak, and all you need is 20,000 by the end of the week. Josh." This thing that I was gonna be part of is-- is so big. And... and, uh, you know, I got left behind. And I got so close to, you know, kind of being my ticket to security. I'm so glad you're here. - Huge fan of the '96 movie. - Oh. And here we are-- I-- I-- this is so cool! It was lovely. It was so lovely. And-- and I-- I'm a-- I-- you know, it's-- it's very meaningful for me to be here. Two things about being a Doctor Who fan. One is to be able to make that contact... - Yeah. - ...with people I admire - and all my heroes. - Yeah. And the second thing is, to bring them to my home. -Yes-- -They're not at my house, but they're at my home, they're on my island. You have now come to Long Island, you've seen things, you've driven on a parkway I drive-- drive on - every day I go to work. - Yeah, yeah. I'm driving along, and I go, "Wow! Matthew drove on this," right? I'm starting to realize, maybe it's not all about the show at all. It's about the-- the sense of community and companionship that they find with each other. Do you have the Eighth Doctor at all? What, like an action figure? - Yeah. - Um... not sure, it'd be over there, if it is. It would be over there. -All right. -Can't vouch for it, -I'm sorry. -Okay. No, no worries. Now the question is, am I finding that companionship with this gang of people? There's something about the childlike, uh, innocence and wonder that Doctor Who gives us. What do you think you're gonna be -when you grow up? -I'm really, really want to be a scientist. You want to be a scientist. So tell me about that. I have been studying rocks... and minerals, and I am also really in-- interested in finding fossils. Putting aside your-- your dad's involvement with being in The Gunfighters, you were a Doctor Who fan. You-- it was, it was a show you knew and loved. Are you Doc Holliday? Sorry. He was a murdering maniac. - Yeah. - Yeah. I think I was behind the picture there. Yes, we finally get our first view -of the saloon set. -That's right. It's down. It's just starting to, sort of-- Suddenly it's all starting to come back. - Yes. - Yes, no. I have a wonderful treat watching these, yes. - Mm-hmm, do you-- - So, I wa-- yeah, I was probably very pleased that my dad was shooting people. Jackie Lane is famous, kind of, for almost vanishing from Doctor Who fandom, and has never really done a convention or been interviewed about her time on Doctor Who. Do you remember meeting her on set, - or seeing her-- - Yes, yes, -I did meet her. -Mm-hmm. This is strange story, I mean, it's all a half memory, but my father, um, uh, my-- my father w-- my father was bipolar. So sometimes he would be, you know, manic, and sometimes he would be depressed, and in those days it was a perilous kind of illness. And one day he put together a village fete, where we lived out in Essex, and he invited her to be the celebrity who came and, you know, opened the village fete. Um, and so my memory was us picking her up from Harlow Town station, and I was very excited. And Dad had said, "You! You-- you, Matthew you know, you can play the guitar, and you can sing Leonard Cohen songs. Um, so you're gonna dress up a minstrel. Um, uh, and walk around the fete singing, 'Suzanne took me down,'" that kind of thing, uh, which of course, I was a little kid, it was totally weird. Everybody ignored me, and I was very upset, but she was, I think, quite sympathetic. You are on hallowed ground. You have actually been able to-- actually get to speak with her, and, uh, have a relationship. Well, I wonder why she didn't turn up? You know, maybe-- I hope we didn't scare her off. Maybe that's why I kept away as well. Possibly. Being connected with my dad, yeah. I think most of my work's intertwined with my relationship with my father, and with a very turbulent era of my life. This is me. Looking a little bit shocked, basically. Where the big shift that happened around 1963, which is when my mother committed suicide. And when the whole life shifted in this giant gear. And even though it wasn't like I'm going around every time I see Doctor Who, I-- you know, I turn into... Bates Motel. Um, you know, it's f-- it is-- it is, um, it is a very seminal part of my life, the early '60s, um, and then it stayed as a constant reminder, that is Doctor Who. I think that it applies to a lot of people. A lot of people hold onto, um, their memories of TV shows at certain points in their lives. All right, just forget it. We're gonna take a picture. All right. I see we have a very young fan down there. -How new are you? -Two years. My mom was re-watching the whole series... and so I was just like, "Oh, what is this she's watching?" And then that's when my Whovian-ship started. My favorite Doctor - is Matt Smith. - Ah. And when I first discovered him, I started to see a lot of myself in him, and as was brought up earlier, I also was-- was bullied quite a bit as a kid. And I always felt ashamed for being the odd man out, and ever since Matt Smith, he has helped me to embrace the silliness and just go out and have fun and-- and do whatever. So is fandom a form of escape? I don't feel an escape, or a leap of faith. I feel a close emotional connection. In some ways, I aspire as a fan, I aspire to be like what I see. But I also see myself reflected in it, um, so it's-- it's a learning experience and it's also an aspirational experience. Snogged Madame de Pompadour. Praise him. Praise him! I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and the stomach of a king! And of a king of England, too! And to think that Dalek, or Zygon, or any creature of the universe should dare to invade the borders of my realm, I myself shall take up arms! Good Doctor! The Doctor never a more noble of a subject. We shall have victory over the enemies of my church of my Kingdom, and of my people! Best in Show for the Masquerade of Mandragora... a queen's words win wars, Joanna Dunlap! It's turned my head a bit. It was easy, at first, to kind of... not laugh at it. I mean, it's easy to lampoon, and some of it is worth laughin' at. - Yeah, yeah. - Come on. But... there's somethin' about it, there's somethin' about... you know, when you get people-- and these shows, and these meetings and these conventions, and these weekends. You know, aside from being sociable, Who-- you know it's got a sense of humor... - Right. - ...which is a great relief. - Um, something goes on. - Yeah. You know, friendships that form. And I mean that, I mean that sincerely. Yeah. And I've been really-- that's why-- that-- that's what's keeping me coming back to it. That's what-- that's what I enjoy the most about it. Um... it-- -It is like finding a family. -Yeah. You're a part of this now! - Forever. - I know, - it's mind-boggling. - Forever, one of us. Maybe we could do a musical version of the TV movie, you know, a Broadway version. - Yes. - Maybe you could write it. Would you write it? Cause it lends itself. "Who Am I?" I've actually been a fan since the '96 movie, which I've been laughed at for, but-- -Why? -You know what? Which-- which I wrote. - Nice. - Yeah. -And-- and co-produced. -Can I get your autograph? - Yes. Absolutely. - Yes. Ah, I am so frickin' pretty! Do you ever have those moments where you're like-- no, really, really, it's a thing with cosplayers where you're-- you're working on your cosplay, and you're like, "Ah, my gosh, this sucks, I suck, my skill sucks, and I don't know what I'm doing, and I feel so inadequate and, ah, I'm crying because I can't do this!" And then you put it on, and you're like, "Oh, my God, I'm beautiful." Oh, my God, I'm beautiful! I got three awards, yeah. That's so good. Did you-- did you kind of know that you were gonna win? - Let's face it. - No, not at all. You always hope, but you never know. How have you changed? Oh, do you think it's changed me? No, it hasn't, has it? Hasn't changed me at all. I have a feeling this is not gonna change me at all. If anything, maybe-- Just make me bigger-headed, yeah. Or it is then the searching questions. I want to get to the bottom of what the Doctor is. It may be in me, I don't know what that represents, looking back into my life and looking forward. Oh, yeah, these are my mother's poems. She did write a funny one, once Hm. Here we go. Tell of my Death. "Tell of my death to the honeybee, and the high wind-hover, that by craggy steep, and humble skep they made my vigil keep. But tell of my death to no child, nor my lover, they cannot leap the chasm deep nor comfort one another." I'm always touched by-- they'll say, "You know, when th-- when I saw that, or when-- when-- or, um, I was kind of in trouble, or something was happening..." - Right. - "...my life, or my family," or something like that, "And that really helped." Yo, Paul's here! - How are you, lad? - Near the end of it. - Good to see you. - Yup. You gonna come into this panel? - Yes. - Right in here. It's a bit of a responsibility, I think, that we have. You know, stories are powerful, mythologies are powerful. - Right. - This is-- this is a particularly-- this is now fifty-odd years of it. With this-- some of these kids really take it-- they're just kids, aren't they? They really have taken things to heart. So my husband passed away, completely unexpectedly, in 2009. He had a heart condition, and he just-- one minute he was here, and the next minute he was gone. And it was... pretty devastating for my son and myself. Those quiet, silent times between sunset and sunrise, the house is a little too quiet and... ...yeah. You can escape instead of thinkin'. And it pulled me outta my head. And out of my sorrow. And gave me something to laugh at. And look forward to. Without that, I don't know where I would be. People come here and they get involved in time travel and they can forget about what's going on outside, which unfortunately there's a lot of things that we don't want to even talk about. All right, dude... hold that thought. I got to do a panel here on The Gunfighters. - I don't have anything to say. - Just start talking. - Okay. I will. - You'd be amazed what comes out. I will, I'll try. But they will, um-- they are ruthless. -Okay. -Yeah. And they ask kind of loaded, and... - Um, complex questions. - Okay. - You're gonna be fantastic. - Um, I will. Because you were fantastic yesterday, and you're gonna be fantastic on The Gunfighters. Cause you're gonna go back to your boyhood memories. - Yeah. - Of being there with your dad. Okay, well, if I drink enough, with-- They'll get some good stuff. - Yeah, you'll still remember. - That was fun. - I love you. - Yeah, it was good to-- -Yeah. -We finally got to do a panel -together, I'm glad of it. -Yes. -Thank you. -Thank you very much. Yeah. I'm talk-- I'm talking to you tonight -about The Gunfighters. -Oh, my God, yeah. I don't know what I'm gonna say about that. All right. - Are you that nervous? - Yeah. I really don't want to do The Gunfighters panel. It's freaking me out. ♪ Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Paul happy birthday to you ♪ Sweet. Bless you, my son. Thank you. -I'll see you around. -See you. What? - Aw. - Aw, come here. - Me? - Yeah. I'd like to say, you two need to get a sense of humor, though. Oh, look! We're here. Scene 30 off the tape, one, mark it. In my mind, why not? Maybe I shouldn't be. But, here. I want to show you something before we start. Then tell me why you're freaking out. We were just filming-- we were just filming, uh, Paul, but look. I... ...wait a sec. I mean-- This is him getting his cake. My hands are shaking. And it was like-- the-- it was like the Pope. It was-- seriously. He was, um, oh gosh. Everybody had their cell phones up. I was relatively close. So sweet. That's really cool. I think at the end of the day, I'm a bigger fan than I knew! I'll be back just as soon as you've finished bringing up my character. But you were there when you were a kid. Yeah, I mean, I was on the set. I was by there, it was like the best day ever. And it was not long after my mother's death and all that jazz, yeah. Uh, and he was on the verge of-- of a breakdown anyway when that happened. It was a shitty childhood, and Doctor Who was part of that shitty childhood, at the end of the day. Uh, I mean-- I could be sentimental and say it was a respite, it was a place to run to. Uh, sadly films were... uh, and still are. Here come the lights. Now! Get 'em. I'd say that you are a fan now, for sure. Yeah. Well, maybe... I'm as screwed up as the rest of them. I mean, cause, let's face it, a pretty screwed-up bunch of people. I mean, not screwed-up, they're very real. You know what I mean, I can't say they're screwed-up, but, uh-- but there's-- there's-- uh, you know, every-- each one of them looks like they're dealing with either being bullied, or-- or, you know, some crisis that they went to, and they moved to Manhattan, but they found a friend, you know. Everybody's crisis, uh, it ha-- seems to be how they resolve their crisis, that they attach to The Doctor, and I'm beginning to realize it's the same. There's still joy to be had there. Well, there is with making this film. This is joyous. Uh, and look at those people. They-- how happy they were. - A community. - No, it is, definitely is. But will I come back to another convention? Uh, who knows. You know, will I sort of be circling my past forever? I don't think I can do that. It's cheaper than therapy, I suppose. My father was in a show that was set in America, and I ended up writing a show the Doctor Who set in America. Um, uh, you know, and so there's a lot of sort of synchronicity there that is strangely moving, in a way. - What... - Yes. ...would you consider to be the best period for when you when you worked in film and stuff? You know, the most enjoyable for you? - For me, the best period? - Yes. Actually, right now. To be honest, making stuff like this, making small films and Hollywood's an ageist industry, so as you get a little older, you have to find other ways of making films. And I've stopped waiting for permission to make films. It's a touching thing that you guys have done, putting together these clips. It's really nice. Ah, it's-- it's part of LI Who -that's doing this. -Yeah. They're putting all of this together. -But, uh-- -No, I mean, really nice. Thank you. Thank you very much. This was fantastic! Oh, my God. Hey there! Hello? You guys-- Oh, okay. Um, I'll-- I'll see if the buzzer works. -Nice to see you. -Good to see you too. - Ooh, sorry! - Oops, sorry. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. Hello. So are you moving tomorrow? The moving people come tomorrow. This is what, when I graduated middle school? - Yeah. - It's a lot of stuff! Three thous-- 3000 pounds as well? Who knows, it may not be that much stuff. Hey, how's it going, gang? - Greg's here. - What's up, Josh? - Hey. Good to see you. - How are you? Hey, Laura. How are you? - How are you? - Good to see you. We see each other on the holidays, and every once in a while, and when you come up, and so-- Yeah. And you'll be able to come down to LA. Yeah, and now I got someone to stay with in Los Feliz, so actually, this is pretty awesome. Sorry about filming this, guys. Dude! It's not-- it's not like that. Don't worry about it. It's all good. - We knew what to expect. - Ah, okay. And dude, it's you. You grew up-- we grew up in a movie. Like, remember when we were kids, and we used to make movies all the time? - It was you! - It wasn't! - He made me do it! - Action! No, it wasn't! It wasn't me at all! Here! Stay away from me! Stay away from me, or the little one gets it! You moved the body! He did, he did! You're right! You're right! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you do it. Just had a dreadful childhood. I mean, you decided to do something different, right? To focus on your career in a different way. Does that say anything about who you are, or have you changed? Yeah, maybe I've been the Doctor. - Hmm. - Maybe I'm regenerating. Which is sweet, do you know what I'm saying? - It's-- it's nice. - Sweet 16. You know, going off into the sweet 60. Not sweet 16, yes, that's very true. There is a new Doctor born at the end of each series, and I think that happens to us all when we go through certain stages in life. We regenerate, and then we regenerate in our families. ♪ Are you carried by a restless wind? ♪ So I'm a regeneration of my father. Or my mother.
