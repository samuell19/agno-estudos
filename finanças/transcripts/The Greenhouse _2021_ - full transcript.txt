So, what was… what was his name? You said, B something. - I s… - Br… - I'm not telling you. - What is… - Brad… - Please, tell us. - Brian… - Was it Brian? Was it Brian? - Br… - It was Bri… No, it was… Brandon. all] Brendan? - Brandon. - Brandon? - Brendan, or Brandon? - Brett? - Bren… Brendan? - Brandon. - Brendan. - Brandon. - Brendan. - Brendan. - Brandon. - Brendan. Brandon… Brandon Kane? - Brandon Kane? - Melissa's brother. - Brandon Kane. - He's cute. - Who's Melissa's brother? - Yeah, he's in my year. What did you guys do? We just… You just… You just… You just what? - What did you do? - We just went to Hungry Jack's, and then we went and saw a movie. - OK. - And then what happened? And then we drove home. And then what happened? That's it. Are you sure? You mean, he didn't kiss you or anything? Not even a peck? - No peck? - A peck. No. No, it didn't feel right. Didn't feel right. Lill we're raising a pack of nuns. No we're not, we're not nuns. All I can say is that when I was your age, I was doing a lot more than pecking. Who were you pecking? Ugly, boring, dweeby, nerdy boys. - Boys? - You are pecking boys? - Did you peck boys? - Really? - Who? - Ruth pecks the boys? Seeing if I liked boys or girls. - So, they were hot? - Not as hot as your mum. Hello. Have you spoken to Andrew? Beth? No, I haven't, and hello to you too, Doonie, how are you? He wants to bring his new boyfriend to Mum's shindig. He has a boyfriend? I thought he had a girlfriend. They broke up ages ago, dude. Yeah, right. Anyway, I told him to ask you, but I knew he wouldn't, so, I thought I'd call. Well, Mum just wants it to be, like, a family thing. Right, also no one knows this guy. Andrew is gonna spend the entire weekend trying to impress this dude, and we're gonna have to go along with it and pretend we're not as fucked up as we are. Well, what do we do about it then? You have to tell him, "No." Oh, are you kidding? Or ask Raf to do it. Alright, I'll ask Raf to do it. This isn't my gun. Well, I'll see you tomorrow, OK. You're getting in at… I'm not doing it. Oh, please, Raffi, he already hates me. Nope, sorry. Are you smoking? - No… Maybe. - Don't smoke. Don't tell Mum. Dude, you cannot hide anything from her. She knows when I get my period before I do… I gotta go, sis, um, I'll text you my train time. Can you please talk to Andrew? Oh, I can't, gotta run. Talk to Andrew for me. Raf! Beth! Are you seriously inviting your fuck buddy to Mum's 60th? OK, who told you that? He's, He's not my fuck buddy, he's my boyfriend. Not happening, Drew, OK? - No random plus ones. - Fine. It's fine, I won't… I won't bring him. He's probably the love of my life, but, of course, no one cares about that. Look, do you even wanna hear about him, or are you just calling to ruin my life? You know I hate bossing you around. Do you hate it? Yes, and I love you. Look, I'm really busy making breakfast, I'm gonna go now. It is midday, you are making lunch. At the very least, it is brunch. Beth… Shit, I… I gotta go. Bye… Hey. Fuck. I was on the phone. Hey. - Hi. - You're back in town. Yeah, I got repositioned in Sydney, and then I had a couple of days off. So, I'm here. Great. I was lucky enough to catch some of Doonie's TV show. It's, um… some quality shit. Oh, it's the literal worst. But no one has the courage to tell her, though. How are the mums? Ah… Sorry, I just have to… Hello, Beth speaking. Hi, we're just checking in, but can't seem to find anyone at the property. Oh, I'm… Um… And Ruth's… Isn't nearby? - No. - No, no, no, OK, not a worry. I will be there in ten minutes max. OK, sure. - Great. - See you soon. OK, bye. Fucking hell. Guests are left without their bloody keys. Do you still live here? Ah, yep. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean for that to sound like it did. - I didn't… - It's totally fine. Yeah, yeah, I um… I do. Mm. But, I have guests waiting for their keys. So, I… I really gotta jet, so… OK. It was lovely to see you, so… Yep. OK, thanks. Yeah. - Hey… - Mm-hm? I… I'm in town for a couple of days, do you wanna get a beer or something? Yeah? Yeah. OK. OK. Where were you today? I had errands. Well, you left two of our guests in the rain. They'll survive. Gosh, you're in a lovely mood, what's happened? Nothing's happened. Do you remember my friend Lauren? One with the hair. - Yeah. - Yeah. I saw her today. I liked her. She asked me how the 'mums' were doing. She really liked you guys. …cutting out the middleman, servicing your needs, so you can eat fresh every day. Previously… Oh… A gun! Cut the shit. Oh, she hated doing that scene. Where is he? Remember? Tonight, on… A man's children just died in a house fire, his wife just committed suicide. Now, call me old-fashioned, but I'm pretty sure that would require a little bit of sensitivity from you lot. She said the computer whiz guy dies… - You speak to ballistics… - Mm. …I'll go question Mrs Pasividis about her so-called vacation. Roger that. He's been around a lot lately. I had errands. Mum? You managed to you leave a couple of guests on the porch in the rain. So, they were pretty pissed about that. Gosh… you're in a lovely mood. What's happened? Nothing's happened. Sure. Do you remember my friend Lauren? Ah, the one with the hair? Holy shit. She asked me how the 'mums' were doing. She really liked you guys. Just give me a sec! Grab some cushions! - No! - Yeah. As if he has a fragrance. No, you kidding? Always smells like elevator jazz. Smell like the boob. - Hey, would you rather… - Yeah? …have sex with your cousin… like, in private, so no one else knows? - Or… - What are you reading? Oh, or… Um… OK, you don't have to have sex with your cousin, but everyone thinks that you have. - Um… - Like, the whole world thinks you've had sex with your cousin. - Well, is my cousin hot? - Um, I don't know, - is your cousin not? - Well, I don't know… Do even have cousins? - I'm serious. - We don't have cousins. Yeah… OK wait, I've got a better one. Would you rather have your mum's bush as a beard for life? Are you serious? Or, would you rather change… Jesus Christ, Andrew. …gender every time you sneezed. Like, is it… Is it an itchy bush? Well, it depends where you put your face… …and if you've got crabs, you dirty dog. Yeah, bush beard, por favor. De nada. OK Andrew, would you rather get me more snacks, or have my fist up your arse? Um, I would rather… Snacks, snacks, snacks. Mm, OK. - Mm-hm. - We love you. Thanks, Andrew. Alright, are you ready? Bring chippies and dip. - Karate me. - Yeah, just wait. - Karate me, I can take it! - OK, alright. - Alright. - Ready? Mm-hm. Ki-yah! Sorry! Oh my god, Doonie, are you OK? Mums our home! Who bought pineapple juice? I bought it, 'cause Raf likes it, and it's not… He was hilarious. What did you guys do? We went to Pizza Hut and then we went to the movies. And then what happened? And then we got in his car and we drove home. And then what happened? - That's it. - Are you sure? You mean, he didn't try and kiss you or anything? - Not even a peck? - A peck. No. No, it didn't feel right. Not right. Jesus, Lill, we've raised a pack of nuns. No we're not, we're not nuns. All I can say… You just do whatever you feel comfortable with, my love. Who were you pecking? Ugly, boring, dweeby, nerdy boys. - Boys? - Boys? You were pecking boys? Fuck! Look, I'm so sorry, my phone was off and I… I'm an idiot. I'm sorry. Why didn't you call Mum? Her phone was off. I'm really sorry, Raf. Fuck. Thanks. Where's Mum? I dunno. She's actually been acting kinda funny recently. Maybe turning 60's kinda getting her down, I dunno. I'm sorry about before. Long train trip. I'll make dinner. He paid his fare and he got out of his cab. Likely story, terrorist. I don't know this man, I've never seen him in my life. Then please explain why you were seen on the evening of the 24th at his place of work. I was having dinner. Hey, hey… You just assaulted a police officer. Sorry, I'm sorry. You're in deep now, mate. Ease up, Cece. You wanna stay alive, you better start talking. Honestly, it's beyond that… Mum… Who's that? Is that my beautiful boy? Hm, we saved you some dinner. I'm fine, I'm fine, I already ate. You're missing 'Jurisdiction', Mum. Oh, why didn't you tell us? Come on. Hey um… are we still on for tonight? Stay with me, Dave. - It's no use. - Someone help! Anyone! - What are you doing? - I'm trying to draw a dick. - Don't do that! - Why? My mums hate it. Hey, so how was Benji's last night? Did you get some? It was fine. Actually no, it was shit. Mm-hm. I mean, his parents treat me like I'm an orphan. Like, they've never mentioned my mums, and any time any fucking family stuff comes up, they exchanged these, like, worried glances. It is weird, though. Nah, it's not weird. They're just fuckheads like everyone else in this town. We're gonna get out of here soon… promise. C'est bon. It's perfect. So, does this really mean that I can't go to Lauren's birthday on the weekend? You're grounded. But I said I was sorry. I'm really tired, Beth, will you just go to bed. Oh, this is so unfair. Life's unfair, Beth, life's really fucking unfair, just get used to it. Why are you being such a bitch? What's going on? What's happened? We had some news today. What… Wait, are you OK? Mum? Just go to bed, Beth. Mum? Mum? Mum, are you running from me? No. How long have you been coming here? Can you please slow down? Mum, can we please discuss this? Get out! What was that? We should not be here together. What is this place? You won't like what you see in there, Beth… I can handle myself. …but if you are half as smart as you think you are, you will not go back in there. I'm going to go back. Yeah well, don't come running to me when it all turns to shit. Look who decided to wake up, mwah! Morning, sunshine! How are you? We have a guest. Bethy, this is Ryan. - Hello. - Hi…Ryan. Hi Beth, thank you so much for having me. Give him a hug, you rude girl. Having another sleep in, Beth. Shut up, Raf. Mm… Bethy left me at the train station for… two hours yesterday. I almost got back on the train and went home. This is your home. Ryan, I apologise for my ungrateful and degenerate children. Anyway, how was your trip? - Yeah, it was good. - It was great. Andrew took the scenic route, and stopped every five fucking seconds to show Ryan the views. You were asleep. Yes well, some of us have jobs that make us tired. I just wanted to show Ryan all the area has to offer. I mean, this area is, I mean, the house alone You up late? …- so far down the coast. - It's beautiful. So, what's the plan today? I have some lines to learn and I could really use - some help from some people. - No. No, I would rather gouge my eyes out with two Gold Logies - than help you run lines. - Guys. Beth'll help. Beth will not help. Beth has way too much to do for tomorrow. Well, I could help, if that's… Really, Ryan? - Yeah. - Mm, no way, Doon. Ryan isn't here to run lines with you. Well, why is Ryan here? Just kidding, Ry, that would be awesome. Cool… Um, what are the lines for? 'Jurisdiction'. 'Jurisdiction'. Right, is that a… It's a show? Prime time, dude. Um, it's like a… - You don't watch 'Jurisdiction'? - I… What the hell? - Don't even start me. - Seriously. I mean, Ryan seems fine, but I specifically told Andrew not to fucking bring him. If by fine you mean, bouge as fuck, then yes, Ryan seems fine. They spent the entire drive talking about petrol prices. What… As if Drew even cares, Mum pays for it. Mum pays for his petrol? I'm gonna kill him. OK guys, we really need to go easy on him, OK? Mum is seriously about to crack, and after all, this weekend is about her. - I need a ciggy. - Are you gonna do those dishes? Does Raf smoke? - Mm-hm. - Does Mum know? Looks good, Raf. Raf… Raf? Looks good. But yeah, it's been good. Oh no, I had a weird moment with the hair and the make up lady. She kinda wanted to have my hair straight for one of the episodes, which was weird. But yeah… Anyway, we'll see. The writers are supposedly considering giving me meatier storylines. I think they can finally see the potential for the character. Sorry, Doon. Sure, wasn't… You know, it's just typical. - What? - Well, you have no idea what shit I have to deal with every day. Please, can we not do this, you just got here. Sure, let's not do it. No, Doonie, I'm sorry. Do you think we're too different? Uh… Well, I mean… he's… What's wrong with you? Your adopted. So are you, dick-stick! Mum, Lauren's gonna come over for dinner if that's OK. Mm-hm, yep, sure. She's been around a lot lately. That's because she's my best friend. Whatever that face is, you can stop it right now. Yeah no, it's not gonna be a party, it's just a couple of friends. Please? Oh, OK thanks, I love you. Yep, I'll be home soon, love you, bye. Yes, he's cool. - Great! - Yah! OK, I gotta go, bye. OK, see you. See you. Don't. - Hey… - No, I look awful. I want photos of you. No, let's take a nice one. Silly. I hope it doesn't rain this afternoon. Might ruin your pretty hair. The last time I saw Danny, he was talking about doing something crazy. We're working against the clock, mate, tell me where he is. Fuck it. Mum went off at me before. About what. Hm, maybe we left them up here too long. Nup, they're fine. Maybe we have left them up here for too long. ♪ Beth Tweedy-Bell, Beth Tweedy-Bell… ♪ ♪ Your mums are gay and they're going to hell ♪ ♪ If you wanna be like them ♪ ♪ Then you smell. ♪ Yeah, it was actually pretty catchy, but… Needless to say, school sucked. - More wine, anyone? - Yes, please. Were you bullied? No, I just made friends with everyone, and had a really chill time. Listen to yourself. - What, you had a "chill' time? - Yeah. Dude, you are a total virgin who didn't get picked on because of everyone's white guilt. OK but… I definitely wasn't a virgin. I can vouch for that. What? Ah… Stacy Smith can vouch for that. Stacy Smith? Not to mention, Ernest… Ernest Kwong. Do you guys want some more wine? Ryan's doing well. He's nice, isn't he. You seeing anyone? Are you… screwing anyone? OK, I'ma just, like, leave you to yourself. You know where to find your room. Good night. 'Night. 'Night, Mum. 'Night. 'Night, idiots. Raf, say goodnight! Will you all shut up. So, I bought this at an art gallery. Yeah… I thought you might really, really love it. Let her open it. I bet I do. It's Viktor Magyar. - Oh my… - He was a Croatian painter. Um… He did all these beautiful things, romantic things of people in nature. Thank you so much, I love it. - I absolutely love it. - OK, next one. Oh, and who's… Who's this from? It's not from me. - It's not from you? - No. No, it's just, just a little, tiny little something. - I'm really touched. - Oh… - You didn't need to do that… - Thank you. …but it's very, very… - …kind of you. - It's sweet. It's just… Thank you for having me. Oh, it's a… It's a lovely bracelet. That is beautiful. - Do you wanna… - Yeah, I'm… Try and put it on, Raffi. Nup, Doonie's getting impatient. - Mine! - Bonnie, bonnie Doon. Let me see. It's a bit messy. I hope you didn't spend… - A little bit. - …too much money. - Poetry, no less. - Hello, Beth speaking. Hey, it's Lauren. And now I am going to read some of the… Hey. Hey look, I'm gonna go back tomorrow, and I was wondering if you want to catch up today? Look, it's not actually a great time for me today. Oh OK, you're busy, that's fine. No, it's Mum's birthday, so… Oh! Nice, which one? Ruth. Ah, Lillian passed away a few years ago. Oh… Um… I'm so sorry, Hon, I, um… You didn't tell me. Um… Look, we're actually just in the middle of breakfast right now, but if you want, I could meet you in town in a few hours? No, you don't have to do that, that's fine, it's… Does midday work? Yeah, if you want. Great. Awesome, OK. Well, I will talk to the others and see you there in a bit. Alright, what can I do? Nothing, it's fine, I've got it covered. Can we set the table? Well, you were supposed to do that yesterday, but obviously that was way too much to ask. Maybe you would be less stressed if you if you actually let us help you. Ah, fuck! Fuck. Ah, fuck. Oh, don't look at me like that. Do you want me to do it? I don't fucking care. Where's Crazy going? Who knows. Lauren, wait. Lauren, wait! Lauren. I can't believe you're doing this. - I told you, I can't leave. - No, you're lying. - No, I can't leave them here. - We're in love. Why won't you fight for that? You're gonna have their support. You're just a fucking coward. My mums fight this fight every day of their lives, and I don't want that. What about me? Lauren… I mean, I can't go back now. What am I supposed to do? Please? I don't want this. I don't want you. I don't want you. I wish I'd never met you. - Take care of mum. - Yeah. Be good. I'm really gonna miss you. Bye. Bye, everyone. I love you. She won't know what to do without me. Hm. I need you to step up. So, what are you saying? Beth, baby… promise me you'll look after your mum. What about me? What about my life? What do I do, just fucking stay here and rot. Mum… I'm sorry, Mum. Mum, I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. Mama, I didn't mean it! The guests will be here soon. Come on, darling. - Mama… - Did you get the ice? Just go and get ready, OK? Go and put your clothes on, get cleaned up. OK. Hi. - How are you? - Good, how are you? - Hello. - Hey, how you doing? - What's going on? - Not much. - Yeah? - Just hanging out. Good to see you both. Oh, thank you. Hey guys, how are you? - Hey, you. - So good to see you. - How are you? - Hey, mate, good to see you. Yeah, it's much better than… than France, I can imagine. - Yeah well, you know. - This time of year. - Yeah. - Oh, that's right, because you guys have just moved back haven't you? - You want a bit more? - Yeah, do you want some? - Yes please. - No, no, I'm good. - You're good? - Thank you, though. - That's perfect. - Mum? - Mm, delicious. - Thank you. It's so good. Um… Ah… Born Ruth Tweedy… to Edward and Emily Tweedy of 18 Jervis Street. Um… Her childhood was quiet… if a little boring. Um, she was not a girl you noticed, really. A bit odd, ah… Struggled… to put sentences together. Um… She grew up and time passed, like it does. Ah, she tried this and that. Dated… profusely. Experimented with drugs. She smoked, but not for too long. She listened to music, she tried to live but struggled to put it all together. She wondered if this would be her portion. Then one day, arrived a girl… unlike any she'd ever met before. Life began. The winter of her heart lifted… They made plans… They let each other dream… big… bigger. Ah… Some days the world would hit them down, and others they would just laugh so hard they couldn't breathe. Soon, they were joined by four… funny, funny kids. For many years they lived together in their big home… and most days, they just felt normal. Time passed, like it does. And they grew old together. - Cheers, Mum. - Cheers. Cheers. Well, thanks for coming, everyone. Doonie had something to tell you, actually. Mum? Last time I went into that place, and… some really twisted stuff kinda happened. Well… you have to respect it. Seeing the past is a gift. Is it? Maybe… you haven't dealt with what you see. And maybe… it's forcing you to deal with it now. The past is just the past, Beth. I don't wanna go back in that place. Then don't. But you shouldn't go back in there either, it's not safe. I'm not to you, Beth. Now, give your mother a spin. Come on, you can do better than that. I'll have to find another partner. Alright, let's go. That's more like it. OK, good night. Oh… Uh-oh, what's this? Farewell, my children. - Woo-hoo. - I love you! Oh, well done, well done today, Mum. I love you. What time are we leaving tomorrow? Ah, leave at about 9am? Drop Raf off at the station. What time's your train, Raffi? Um, I think it's about 10:15am. Hm. I'm gonna call it a night. Let's finish our drinks. We're leaving tomorrow. No, I got plenty of stuff to do tomorrow, so I gotta go. Why when you just finish your drink? How often are we all together? I've had enough. Sure. You know, I feel like I missed something. Like, a few months ago everything was fine, - and now you actually hate us. - I don't hate you. Well, you've spent the entire weekend rolling your eyes and huffing and puffing like we're the worst thing that's happened to yours and Mum's - fucked up little existence. - Doonie… As a matter of fact, Doonie, this probably would have been a lot easier if you just hadn't come along. What the fuck, Beth? - This is our home too. - Oh, is it your home? Because the last time I checked, I had to twist all your arms to come back here for a weekend. As a matter of fact, last time I checked you were all too fucking busy with your lives to even care about your family. Bullshit, Beth. We're living our lives like normal people. - Oh… - What would you rather as do? Fucking, waste away up here attending to be OK. - I don't do that. - Yes, you fucking do. You love being the daughter who stayed behind and sacrificed everything for Mum. Have you actually seen mum recently? She's not better, she's worse. - Fuck you, Andrew. - Let's call it a night. You need to take a nice long look at why you're so fucking jealous of us. Drew, shut up. Maybe it's 'cause we're not so shit-scared of who we are. Personally, I would love to acknowledge the fact that Beth had a fucking girlfriend and everyone knew. What? You know Mum and Mum knew, right? - How'd they find out? - Lauren told us. They were so hurt when they found out. That was none of your business, Doonie. Our mum died thinking you were ashamed of her. Stop it! Mum? Mum? Fuck. - Hey. - Raffi… Mum's gone missing and I need you guys to come home, OK? - What you mean? - Raf, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Mum has gone missing. OK, just, just… Beth, she's probably just gone out. No, she hasn't gone out, OK, she left a note. OK, OK, Beth, Beth, Beth, just relax, alright. We'll be there soon, just… Beth, listen to me. Yes, we'll be there, just sit tight, alright? OK, come now. What's happening? Our mum's gone missing. Is she not back yet? She doesn't know what she's fucking doing. "Don't come after me. "Care for one another like I know you will." Why don't we all sit down, and you tell us everything? I know that she's been going in there, and I just… I don't think she understands what this place is. And I just don't think she's safe in there, and… like… I fell asleep one time and my hand was in the earth, you know what I mean? And I just… I just think there's so much more to it, and I don't trust it, and you know how stubborn she is, and I'm just worried that Mum's not gonna see reason. But, if we can convince her together… I dunno. - Wait, what the fuck? - Yeah, you've gone insane. You… You've actually gone insane. Fine, I'll do it on my own like to do everything fucking thing. - Here we fucking go again. - Andrew, just quit it. Usually I'd agree with your sentiment - that Beth's gone insane. - Oh thanks, Raf. But…to be honest, something has been a bit off this time. I think there might be some truth to this. Well, there's only one way to find out. Why did you come here in the first place? She heard voices, remember. That's right. How lovely. Hey Beth… did the voices ask you to open the Chamber of Secrets, as well? I swear to God, Andrew, if you don't shut the fuck up, I will leave you in the past forever. Come on. What if she's not here? She's definitely gonna be here alright, you just need to trust me. So long as we don't touch anything in there, everything will be fine. Shit. Andrew. Fuck. Are you done? Andrew, you're on my hair! Well, get your ass out of my face. Pull… Pull the latch. Doon, fuck. Is that normal? No. Sure looks like home. - Mum! - Shh. OK, come on, let's try the house. Come on. Typical. Let's split up. Mum! She's not in her room. Why don't you take a picture? Beth, I'm sorry about what I said before. I can't talk about this right now, OK? When then? I'll go back to the city and I'll never hear from you again. Don't make me feel like shit, you should feel like shit. Yeah, I should and I do, but I am sorry. You only ever think about yourself, are you aware of that, Andrew? You do whatever you want, regardless of who it affects. When are you gonna fucking grow up? When are you gonna fucking grow up? Me either. I don't know, um… It's not… as black and white as I thought it was. Mum, Andrew likes boys! "How happy some o'er other some ca…" I can't do it. Yes you can. Just take a deep breath, and start again. I can't do it, Raf, I'm not gonna get in. I'm not blonde or tall or beautiful, I'm too different. That is not true. OK, you are you, and that is exactly fine. They're gonna love you. They're killing me off the show. What? Why? Suicide bombing, or something. Told me last week. You OK? "How happy some o'er others some can be…" "..through Athens I am thought as fair as she. "But herein mean I to enrich my pain, "to have his sight thither and back again." See? So, you were scared we'd see something you didn't want us to see? Is that why you kept this place a secret? Mm. I get that. I shoulda told you. Did you go back? Where? To before? When we were young? When mum was still alive? Yep. Would you? I wouldn't think twice. I think I said what I said, because I… I don't understand how it got like this. We used to be best friends. And you never spoke to me about Lauren, or any of it. I was really confused, Drew. You didn't have to face it alone. You had us. You still have us. Get more Fanta. You know, maybe it's a good thing I'm getting cut. I mean, the show's shit anyway. Raf, can you slow down? Raf? Shall we go down… Down by the trees? Wait. Shit, please? Are you alright? Oh, that's not good. We fucked up. The gate… - Just go! - Oh, shit. Jesus, just go, go! Go, go! - Right, let's go! - Follow me! Come on. Oh, fuck. Yeah, we gotta go. Come on, let's go. I'm OK. You OK, you OK? Yeah. Come on. Guys? It's OK, it's OK. Lill? Mum? - Oh, we were so worried. - I'm fine, I'm fine. Mum… I missed you, I was so scared. I'm OK. Mum, we have to leave. - No. - It's not safe. - I'm not coming. - What? What do you mean, you're not coming? - No. - I'm not coming. - I've tried. - What have you tried? I've tried to live. But you have us. I know I do, darling. Then don't go. You can see why I didn't want you to come here. I am so sorry. I love you. I know. Hello. Hi. Are your friends OK? They're my siblings. You're lucky, I never had siblings. Time to go. Well, I'm being called. What's your name? Ah, Beth. Well, I wish we had more time, Beth. Yeah, me too. Mum? Mum! Mum! We need to go. We need to go. Come on. Come on Drew, we gotta go. Holy fuck, come on. Come on! Come on, Andrew. You OK? Don't let go of each other. Find the car. You ready? Go, we're right behind you. Hold onto each other, don't let go. Andrew! Doonie!
