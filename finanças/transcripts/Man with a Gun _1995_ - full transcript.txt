[gunshot] JOHN WILBUR HARDIN [VOICEOVER]:I've done this a hundred times. But always from the other end of the gun. Before, the kingdom belongs to people. No. Belongs to those who-- no, that's not it. For the kingdom belongs to such as these. Yeah, that's it. The kingdom. [car roaring] I have no idea what you did. But I do know you get what you deserve. The good die young. But the bad, they die ugly. [SOFTLY] Dear Jack. [knocking] Hi. What are you doing here? Not what I call real hospitable, Roy. Wait right here. PHILIP MARQUAND: Jack, this might take a while. I think you better sit down. What in God's name were you thinking? $2 million. How did people come up with these numbers? JACK RUSHTON: I've got it under control. You talk too much, Jack. And you think with your prick. At least where Rena is concerned. Should have gotten her pregnant. She's got far too much time on our hands. JACK RUSHTON: I can handle it. Hardin's here. Ugh. [sighs] [inaudible]. Just tell him to wait. [receding footsteps] PHILIP MARQUAND: No connective tissue. Your words, Jack. A simple construction loan. How is it we suddenly havefederal agents sniffing around? Your wife, running looseon the information highway. Sending perfumed blackmail notes, Huh! You're gonna need a second mortgage. She's not getting a dime. I'll find her. PHILIP MARQUAND: I'm sorry, Jack. But you're wrong. You're going to do exactly what she says. You're going to follow her instructions. You're going to pay two million. This isn't a simple marital disagreement. This is incriminating evidence. Names, dates, bank accounts. No one's going to do any time. We're counting on that. Just get back the fucking disk. And don't bother to get up. I know my way out. I have another mission for you. Hmm. Turns out there's a thief in the family. I'll try to get back whatshe took from me, and I will. I want her to die. I never killed a woman before. You're not going soft on me, are you, sir? You know, just making a statement of fact. If you can kill a rattlesnake,you can kill my wife. You make it sound easy, Jack. Your shot. JOHN WILBUR HARDIN [VOICEOVER]:People in their kingdom. People who live up there in the clouds. They weren't above pushing each other off to keep themselves there. Now, Jack's wife-- she did have a lot in common with arattlesnake, that's for sure. She was cold. She was venomous. She had a lot of curse. Luncheon for two. Limp green salad. Prime rib ala hockey puck. Cold mashed potatoes and carrots sludge. Bon app tit. I got hang up. Well, you work too hard. How about dessert? There's something I have to tell you. What's that? Your husband hired me to kill you. [scoffs] And this is how you're gonna do it? [laughs] JACK RUSHTON: It's-- it's $20million we're talking about. This is beautiful. What's wrong with you? ED QUIGLEY: All right. Is there something you can doto make it a little bit more legitimate? You know, maybe-- maybe put up a house or two? Oh, God. [laughs] OK, never mind. Listen, [inaudible]. We'll put up a house. We'll put 'em on a 60-footpylons with big red flags. You knew what you were getting into when you found us the money. - Listen. - What? Listen. The Justice Department hassubpoenaed the bank records. What about the other property? How am I gonna explain all this? You don't. You don't say a thing. Not a thing. Ed, you made a bad loan. Simple as that. We all thought this thingwas gonna be a boom. OK? That mean, it's not. Unfortunately, that's why some things go. All right. All right. I-- I don't know. I don't think they're gonna buy that. Neil Bush. Same situation. Only much bigger. 70,000 only fined a slap on the wrist. All right. JACK RUSHTON: It's over, it's out. All right. All right. All right. My father was a mailman, Mr. Rushton. Not the president. I mean, jeez. JACK RUSHTON: I want you listen to me. Am I wrong, or did everybody make out very good on this deal? No. JACK RUSHTON: Everyone madegood on this deal, right? Yeah. OK. I would like for you torelax, take a deep breath. [inhales] Deep breath, come on. OK. Relax, close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close 'em. Now, open your eyes. Ba-bam! What do you see? 20 years to life. No. Pristine wetlands. The only property in the state that comes with a natural water garden. And how do you put a value on that? What do you say, $6,000 an acre? [phone ringing] You're crazy. JACK RUSHTON: No. I'm brilliant. The environmental wackos aregonna come out of the woodwork. Environmentalist. MAN'S VOICE: Mr. Rushton? I'll be right there. Come on. - No, I-- - I got an idea. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Wetlands? JACK RUSHTON: Ed, you worry too much. You worry too damn much. Tonight, I want you to take Dawn out to dinner. Have a good time. It's on me. Talk sweet to her, be niceto her, and have a good time. Now, get in the car and go out to eat. Please. Huh? - It's Roy. Yeah. Yes? What about the credit card trail? Jesus, Roy. Roy. When are you gonna start thinking? I want you to grease hispalm with another $1,000. And I want the time and place of all of those charges. When and where. OK? No! No! No more crap about how hard she is to find. Do I, at least, get a last cigarette? So, Jack wants me dead. Oh, that's the impression I got. I take it a body's part of the deal? Creates kind of a problem, considering how much I like you. Wow. I'm touched. [chuckles] Don't worry about it. Doesn't have to be me. It just has to be somebodythat looks like me. Yeah, nobody looks like you, Rena. As a matter of fact, there is somebody who looks exactly like me. JOHN WILBUR HARDIN: And who's that? And now, would be my twin sister, Kathy. Your sister? RENA RUSHTON: Yeah. My twin sister. Oh, please. Don't look at me like that. You don't even know her. It's just another hit. That's what you do, isn't it? You kill people. JOHN WILBUR HARDIN: I killlow-lifes, dead beats. Button men. People. Kathy is no angel. She stole a sweater of mine when I was 11. I guess that qualifies herfor the death penalty, then. You got a better idea? [siren wailing on the distance] Are sure about this? I'm so sure, I'll double his price. After all, she's family. You're cold, baby. I'm hungry. [music playing] Well, well, well. Today must be your lucky day, Johnny. That would be a nice change. What's up? Depends on who's asking. [inaudible] aroundhere, not that I know of. Did hear a rumor, though. Oh, Yeah. Yup. Heard some young canary took a midnight dip off the 5th Street pier. You turned into aregular gossip there, Hank. [laughing] How've you been? I'm gettin' by. Not another taste of good bourbon or fine pussy won't cure. Plenty of that around here, huh? Uh-huh. [laughter] JOHN WILBUR HARDIN: I got something goin' on I need some help with, Hank. Mm-hmm. OK? Uh-huh. [birds chirping] [indistinct voices] Teamwork. Teamwork. Come on. All right, that's good. Here it comes. Here we go. Good. Pull harder, kids. Get that main out. You have to [inaudible] a littlefaster than that, Brandon. If the wind was really blowing,that sail would be in the water by now. Hey, Myster. How's it going? Did you have a good day? Hmm? [radio news on background] [water running] [cat meows] Myster? What? Are you hungry? [screaming] Anybody I know? It's a long story, Hank. Oh, really? What are you messing with here? Man, the whole world's looking for that baby. You're not planning a lot ofcash and in yourself, are you? [sighs] No. Don't worry, Hank. It'd only be for a couple of days. Rider, stay! Want a beer? JOHN WILBUR HARDIN: No. You wanna count it? Nah. [birds chirping] [whistling] [knocking on door] Oh. Oh, my God. Yes? Telegram here for you, Uncle Jack. [grunts] RENA RUSHTON [VOICEOVER]: Dear Jack, it's time we got together. We have a lot of catching up to do. In fact, I've got a littletrip planned for us. Roy. Yeah? Get me some coffee. RENA RUSHTON [VOICEOVER]:I have a present for you. And I know you'll have something for me, too. Aren't you? Do be a darling and bringin my little red tote, and check it through to Miami. Miami. Is that all gonna fit? I hope so. Seriously, if it doesn't,[inaudible] to change? Shut up. OK. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. RENA RUSHTON [VOICEOVER]: Beat the airport by noon today. There's a ticket waiting foryou at the United counter. Don't fuck it up, Jack. I know lots of people would love to have this disk if you don't want it. You know how rational I canbe when I don't get my way. And come alone. See you on board. Kisses, Rena. Hello? Hello. - I'm Jack Rushton. - Yes, sir. Any luggage? Your ticket, sir. Gate 27B. Have a nice flight. WOMAN ON PA: The last callfor United flight 56 to Miami. Now boarding at Gate 27B. WOMAN'S VOICE: Have a nice flight. Goddammit. [screams] [playful giggling] [breathing heavily] Uncle Jack, uh-- What? Pa-- package for you. Give you some flowers. RENA RUSHTON [VOICEOVER]:Now, if only I had another $10 million. Some dime. I think I could be happy forever. --happy forever. [breathing heavily] Give me your gun. Why? Give me your gun. Give me the gun! Fucking idiot. [gunshots] Whew. [SINGING] What a friend we have in Je-- Her side of the bed. [mellow music playing] [breathing] Stand up slow so the blooddon't rush to your head. Rider, stay! [rider barking] How did Kathy and Rena come from the same place at the same time? Kathy was a child. She was innocent. She was surprised. Yeah. Surprised. I wanna thank you for agreeingto come here to meet me, sir. What do you want, Roy? My uncle's got some problems, sir. Apparently, things didn'tgo so smoothly at the airport. Uh-huh, that was a complete fuck-up. But Uncle Jack's goteverything under control. I mean, at least, for the long run. I, uh-- Go on. Well, it's not like I'm ungrateful for the opportunities he'sgiven me, or anything. It's just-- It must have been difficult for you to come here today and speakto me about your uncle. No, actually, he thinksI'm off looking for Rena. I mean, morally. Ethically. Yeah, right. Well, like I said, I appreciate everything he's done for me so far. He treats you like a piece of shit. Like a little dog that had to be whipped. It's no wonder you want tosink your teeth into his ass. Come on. Let me tell you a story. Some years ago, I was called upon to perform a rather unsavory task. There was a man in the organization. He'd become a burden. The honor of disposing ofthis man was bestowed upon me. And as proof of the act, Iwas to deliver his watch. In those days there was moreritual than what we did. Yeah, I saw "The Godfather". When the time came,however, I couldn't do it. I'd like to think, it was areflection of my character. Yeah, right. But your Uncle Jack was there that day. He took the gun, and he blew the guy's head off. He took the watch off the guy'swrist and he gave it to me. Never said another word about it. I was rewarded handsomelyfor that act, Roy. And Jack won my loyaltyfor the rest of his life. But now, it's my ass that's on the line. That disk falls into the wrong hands, everything we built will be destroyed. I can't protect him anymore. I would like to recommend thatyou handle the exchange, Roy. You bring the disk to me, not to your uncle. Yeah. [helicopter whirring] A token. JACK RUSHTON: Roy? Where the hell are you, Roy? Fuck you, Uncle. JACK RUSHTON: Roy? [sighs] Hey, deaf Jack. I said, fuck you. JACK RUSHTON: Roy! [gun cocks] I'm not gonna tell you again, Jack. Shut the fuck up. Here, Roy, Roy. Here, Roy, Roy. How are you doing? Not bad, Uncle Jack. How are you doing? [loud cry] Whoa! [grunts] [laughing hysterically] [incoming footsteps] [nervous breathing] Usually, I take a job, I just do it. Don't ever think about it. Please, let me go. There's been a mistake. I don't have-- I don't-- if it's money youwant, I don't have any money. I can tell you that right now. You're different, though. Different. Different? Well, you know, most people would've done something, even if Idon't know what it is they did. So, in a way, they're kind of expecting it. It's a matter of time, I guess. Please, let me go. I won't say anything. Well, no can do. Why? What's the worst thing you ever did? I don't know. I can't recall. [crying] Did you ever steal a sweater? [SOBBING] No. You better eat some of thatfood, 'cause it's getting awfully nasty-looking. Damn you! Suit yourself, honey. I'm not Rena. I'm not Rena! I know. And I thought you had more brains than me. This can't go on forever. We had reason to killher, five, six days, man. It'll all be over before that. JOHN WILBUR HARDIN[VOICEOVER]: Aim and shoot. Collect the cash. Aim and shoot. Then, collect the cash. I've done this 100 times. I don't know that she ever dida bad thing in her whole life. Hmm, Rena. Rena. I knew I was in trouble. I was in the middle ofsomething, and it wasn't good. [slow music playing] Am I, or am I not, absolutely incredible? How's Jack taking it? Has he blown a fuse, yet? How far are you gonna go with this? Oh, I don't know. Maybe a little bit further. Don't be mad at me, baby. Obviously, plans exist to be changed. It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up. So, sue me. We both have our little secrets. Where is she? What's your hurry? Don't play cute with me, Hardin. That's my game. The deal was you deliver Kathy to Givanski. Givanski says he hasn't seen her. So, where is she? Oh, I get it. She's kind of a cute little thing, isn't she? The sort of girl you wantto take home to mama? [laughs] Don't make me laugh. She's a bore. She always has been. She's not nearly enoughwoman for a man like you. Rena knows what you like. Come and get it, baby. Where's the rest? Where's the body? What is this, a quiz show? Take it or leave it. That's one thing I like about you, Hardin. You're always so fucking predictable. Oh, nice doing business with you. I guess I'll see you at Givanski's. Sure about that? You know something I'venoticed about you lately? I get the feeling you don't exactly trust me. Something on your mind? Keep them warm for me. Yeah, I'll keep them warm for you. That's for damn sure. [clapping] ROY BURCHILL: Don't worry. I got him covered. Shut the fuck up, Burchill! [gunshot] Get in. [panting] [screams] Let me go. Let me go. Goddamnit, let me go. Hey! Let me go, please. Hey! Shut up and listen to me. Shut up. I am letting you go. - Let me walk away. I am letting you go. Did you hear what I say? - Let me walk away, please.- OK. OK. OK. - You're not letting me go.- I can't! - You were just-- - Hey! I'm running out of time. You understand that? Now, come on. [sobbing] Don't move. [jazz music playing] Take the first train. Go as far as you can. Buy yourself a new car. Nothing used. Here's some money. Should be enough to get you by for a while. Put it away. You're gonna have to change your name. Stay away from the same initials. Is Rena your girlfriend? Apply for a Social Securitycard, driver's license. Change the color of your hair. Are you in love with her? It's hard to love a girl like Rena. [phone dialling] No contact with family, friends, anybody. OK. Don't call. Don't write. Only subscribe to your local newspaper. Do you understand? I died after all. All right. That's it. Go on. Get out. Go. Move. Go. Hey, hey, Cinderella. MAN ON PA: Amtrak passengersdestined for Spokane, Denver, and all points east you maynow board on platform 114. What's your problem? [chatter] All aboard! [grunts] Hey! Hey! Steady! [grunts] Ugh! [gasps] Let's go. Careful. Move! [screams] [gunshot] Jump! Now! [gunshot] Drop it. Go ahead. Now, the other one. [gunshot] [screams] Get out of the way! Are you all right? Come on. Let's go. [sirens wailing] I wanna know right now what's going on? Five of my top men have been killed. And I just now heard about it. What's going on? It's like this, Uncle Jack. [clears throat] It's like this. Just say it. - Hardin's in on it with Rena.- What? We spotted him down at the station. [inaudible] they were taken off.- Where did they go? Are they dead? What's going on? I don't know. Things went haywire. It's-- it's Hardin. You told me that. I wanna know where they are. He's bonin' her, Jack. Yeah, Jack, they're knocking boots. Big wankeroo. He's putting it so deep, you wouldn't-- [thud] You fucking idiot. Don't you ever call me Jack. Oh, boy. Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy. He's boning her. [music playing] You're still with me? Yeah. [inaudible] you gotta help me here. I don't know what I'm doing. JOHN WILBUR HARDIN: Dilaudid. What? Dilaudid. [SOFTLY] Dilaudid. Dilaudid. Got it. Subtract some with the syringe. [whispering] JOHN WILBUR HARDIN: You got it? Yeah. How much? Five cc's. Ha. They had that, um, Marcus Welby. Give me your arm. Are you all right? You gotta sleep now. Good night. Sweet dreams. RENA RUSHTON: Hello, baby. You don't have to be shy around your Auntie Rena. I know what he's capable of. He's one sadistic bastard, isn't he? He should've cut off your fucking prick. Hardin was your idea, genius. Once you pop a Valium and chill. Oh, that's a nice little watch. Looks like a retirement gift to me. Oh, yeah? We will see. Marquand wants me to take over. I'm gonna be the big guy now. Oh, really? Uh-huh. I see. So, that little blood bath atthe train station, that was just a practice run, big guy? Hear me now, [inaudible]. Without Kathy, you can kissyour glowing future goodbye. You can kiss me goodbye, too, 'cause I'm not going through with it. You're not going anywhere, hear me? Don't worry. I got too much invested in this. I'll personally take it 50 miles off shore and then burn up the fucking ocean myself for the fucking sharks that you want. And I don't care if ittakes my whole fucking life. Burchill. What? You're touching my arm. I'm gonna nail this one in record time. WOMAN'S VOICE: Hey, Jack. Where is he? Where's who? Your buddy, Hardin. Oh, I haven't seen him in a week. Maybe even more. [inhales] Don't feed me that shit, brother. Been seeing you talkin' to him. Tell you what. You look like a smart fella. You help me with this, and I'll tell you where to find your boy. You want me to help you with your crossword? Sure. Here we go. 27 across, area of a nuclearreactor involving Homer's primary task. OK. OK, that-- that was a tricky one. Hmm. How 'bout this? Uh, 19 down. Cheese stuffing from a noodle. Get this fuck around here. THUG'S VOICE: Let's go. - Hey, man. Oh, easy. Easy. You know, [laughs] between myhypertension and my plugged up ticker, you got about five minutes before something blows, boy. Let's not waste any time. ROY BURCHILL: OK. Let's try it again. Where the fuck is he? You think that we're going that for you? OK? That's a real puzzler, kind of makes you think. Uh, wouldn't you, wouldn't he? He loves me. He loves me not. I tell you what. You tell me where he is, I'll give him the chance to sit in that seat. How's that sound? Let's try 16 down. HENRY GRIGGS: Ugh. Oh. Looks like I made a mess. Ugh. Guess I'm going to have to clean it up. [rider barking] [gasping in pain] You know, I'm just aboutthrough being played with you. Oh. Hands, please. You ready for 19 across? [whistling] Sorry? Are you seeing, now, we're getting somewhere! Closer. [screams] Fuck! Son of a bitch! [loud thud] Hey. Hey. You're up. Miraculous recovery. You, hungry? Yeah, I'm starving. Good. Why don't you make some toast? ELI SPINDEL: Luxor Imports. That's Jack's main front, his cash cow. From the looks of his books, he's milking it pretty well, too. What else has you got for me? Cars are rusting, which is heavily mortgaged. Rainbow fields, of course. Grenada Gravel and Construction. Little Cuba Diaper Service and the arena fit for life boutiques. [scoffs] That's rich. Yeah, Plus he got a couple of 100,000 in miscellaneous stocks and bonds. Most of them with, uh, Microfintech. That could take off. We've got some losers here. Dump the marginal ones. The rest seem to add up toa nice little portfolio. We've got almost sufficient collateral. Eli, you got a sharp eye for the bottom line. You need to share a coupleof points off the interest. Give him a little oxygen.I introduced him to Rena. People are concernedyou've lost control, Jack. Are you going to give me the money or not? Are you sure this is gonna be it? Yes. PHILIP MARQUAND: Looks likeRena has surprised us all. When the dust settles, you should think about taking it a little easy. ELI SPINDEL: And, this is the last one. That is the last one. JOHN WILBUR HARDIN: I didn'texpect you to be here. Why did you stay? KATHY PAYNE: I figured, I owed you that much. You don't know anything. You saved my life. Yeah. I don't even know your name. It's, uh, Hardin. John W. Hardin. What's W stand for? I don't give it out to everybody. You don't give it out? Why not? Hmm, no reason. Are you, what, embarrassed? No. How bad could it be? Willy. Winston. Wyatt. All right, all right, all right. Wilbur. [laughs] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That, I mean-- I read a book when I was a kid, and there was a character in it. His name was Wilbur. He's a pig, right? Yeah. He-- he can speak. [laughs] I worry about that pig. Yeah, sure you did. Charming woman, your wife. And such excellent taste. Diamonds of that size and brilliance are a particularly fine investment. Wrap 'em up. Hey. Have you ever heard of saying that goes, "Suffer the little children."? Yeah. That's rest. You must've saw the [inaudible] Yeah, I did. The rest is, uh, "come unto me." I used to think it was a threat. 10-years-old when I first came up here. This place used to be acamp for youth offenders. They sent me up here after my mother died. KATHY PAYNE: I was justwondering, why you came back? Nice piece of property. Actually, uh-- actually, it's the closest thing I ever had to a home. Hmm, I like it. Who's that guy in the picture? A friend of mine. Looks after me once in a while. Someone you can count on? Oh, yeah. Yeah. [phone ringing, rider barking] [music playing] [helicopter whirring] I've got to go back. Take care of things. Why can we just leave? Just keep on calling. Nah. You'll never be safe. You're doing this for me? JOHN WILBUR HARDIN: I got you into this mess and I'm gonna get you out of it. Be careful. Yeah. Church. Strange place for us to be on, Jack. I'll get back what she took. It won't cost you a dime. Roy's in on the deal with Rena. It's funny you say that. That's what he's telling me about you. That is funny. I guess that's what they callan old-fashioned carve up. That makes you the turkey. What are you? Mr. Wizard? You got crystal balls? I could have walked away. It's never too late. I married Rena in this church. I know I haven't always been fair with you, Roy. There's been times I've done things and I've said things I've later regretted. And the funny thing is,right now, you are the one who's gonna save my ass. That's what family's all about, Uncle Jack. Don't you forget that. When I fell in love with Rena, I fell hard. And I brought her into our little family and we accepted her. Right? Right. Remember that? Yeah. She's betrayed me. In the sense of family, she's betrayed you. That's for sure. I want you to go get the disk back. And then what are you gonna do? You want me to kill her? Why not? Why not? Right in the head. [pop] Why not? Oh, boy. Bye, bye, [inaudible] [inhales sharply] Ah. Be cool, Roy. Shit! Be cool. [phone rings] Yeah? Oh, yeah. I'm sure. Only a lunatic would havethe balls to follow me here. Yeah, I see it. Hang on. Right. I got it. I'll be there. Hey, big guy. What took so long? We did it. Almost. Where's the disk? What's your hurry? Give me the disk. What's your hurry? [laughs] [guffaws] Don't be silly, Roy. Here, hold this. Hold it. [laughing] It's just [inaudible] [gunshot] [popping sound] Hardin. I like it so far. And here, I thought, we were old news. Finished. Kaput. Here. Just go back in business, baby. What do you say to 50-50? Is that Roy's deal? Honey, I missed you. I take all the blame. It was very insensitive ofme to ask you to kill her. But at least now, we knowyour limits, don't we? Knock it off, Rena. Oh, I see. She got to you, did she? Give me the disk, and the diamonds. Get the hell outta here. [car roaring] [gunshots] [hissing sound] I don't wanna kill you, Rena. Don't make me do it. You're not gonna kill me, Hardin. [gun cocks] Jack. Hello. I was going to call you. - You were? - Yes. You're a busy girl. Well, I was taking care of things. Everything's according to plan, baby. Marquand won't figure outwhat's happening until the banks [inaudible] foreclose on him. By then, we'll be long gone, honey. You look happy. I am happy. You're so hot. And I want you to know that I miss you. I do. I miss that heat. I miss you, too, baby. Good. We're gonna makesomething happen together. I know we can. I never met anyone like you in my life. And I love you. [screams] Hah! Ah! Ugh! What are you doin'? Son of a bitch. You son of a bitch. She was my wife. [gunshot] [coughs] You're a real ladykiller, aren't you, Hardin? Sayonara, baby. See you around. [thunder sounds] [gunshot] Ugh! There's a first time for everything. [jazz music playing] JOHN WILBUR HARDIN [VOICEOVER]: So the big guy keeps the kingdom. Such as it is. But down here, one thing's for sure. The rich keep getting richer. And the rest of us, poor saps, well-- somebody is gonna contemplate life-- You can sleep now. Sweet dreams. JOHN WILBUR HARDIN [VOICEOVER]:--in all its forms. [music playing] When I was a young man, my father said to me. He said, you got to stay in school, man. A big success you'll be. But I didn't take his advice. Never did him right. I guess I got what I deserved. It's all in black and white. He said, that's the breaks. That's the way the dice roll. It hurts and it aches, butthat's just the way it goes. He said that's the breaks,that's the way the dice roll. It hurts and it aches, butthat's just the way it goes. Way it goes. Once I met this lady. She turned and said to me. She said, treat me right and maybe, we can live our life in peace. But I didn't take her advice. I always pick a fight. Couldn't seem to make it last. Now, she's part of my past. She said, that's the breaks. That's the way life goes. It hurts and it aches, butthat's just the way it goes. She said, that's the breaks. That's the way life goes. It hurts and it aches, butthat's just the way it goes. The way it goes. Now, I sit and wonder, how I came all this way? A big part of my life is gone. What a price to pay. But I still no good from bad. Could have been all I had. Maybe soon, I'll say goodbye. First, let me tell you why. 'Cause that's the breaks,that's the way life goes. It hurts and it aches, butthat's just the way it goes. 'Cause that's the breaks. That's the way life goes. It hurts and it aches, butthat's just the way it goes. That's just the way it goes. That's just the way it goes.
