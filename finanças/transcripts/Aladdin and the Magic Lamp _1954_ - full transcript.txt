NARRATOR: The ancient city of Baghdad in Persia many, many years ago. Aladdin was a poor tailor and to him one day there came a stranger, a sorcerer. Come. Come with me. Come. You can have a palace like the Caliph himself. Look, the Caliph's daughter, Dinarsarde. To be your wife. Do what l ask. Hmm. The sorcerer took Aladdin far up into the mountains and came to an old well. SORCERER: Ha! (SORCERER LAUGHlNG EVlLLY) There is a lamp down in the cave. Fetch it. Fetch it. (SORCERER LAUGHlNG) Fetch me the lamp. Down. (SORCERER LAUGHlNG) -Give me the lamp. -Not until l have climbed out. -You will not. -No! Let me out. -You will stay. -No! -Stay. -No! Please! Stay there, ungrateful. Stay, with only the lamp for company. (SORCERER LAUGHlNG EVlLLY) Stay! GENlE: What are your commands, o lord of the lamp? Lord of the lamp? GENlE: l am slave of the lamp and will do what you ask. Then take me home and out of this cave. Aladdin decided to use the magic of the lamp to win the hand of Dinarsarde. He made the lamp build him a wonderful palace. Aladdin's palace was the wonder of all Baghdad. Even the Caliph admired it and came to visit Aladdin. The Caliph was so impressed that he gave his daughter Dinarsarde to be Aladdin's wife. Now that he had won Dinarsarde, Aladdin put the magic lamp away. One day, Aladdin went hunting and left Dinarsarde alone in the palace. New lamps for old! New lamps for old! lt was the sorcerer in disguise. New lamps for old! New lamps for old! DlNARSARDE: New lamps for old? Dinarsarde remembered the old lamp which Aladdin had hidden away. SORCERER: Oh! (SORCERER CHUCKLlNG) Thank you. As soon as the sorcerer held the magic lamp, he called the genie. The genie carried the palace with Dinarsarde and the sorcerer away from Baghdad. (PEOPLE CHATTERlNG) Aladdin was desolate. The Caliph was furious and sent his soldiers to arrest Aladdin. He was condemned by the cruel executioner. But he escaped. (PEOPLE CHATTERlNG) When Aladdin looked around him, he saw his own palace, standing there in the mountains. Dinarsarde quickly told Aladdin what had happened and together they planned to steal the lamp from the sorcerer's bedroom. (SORCERER SNORlNG) (SORCERER MUMBLlNG) Aladdin rubbed the lamp and sent the sorcerer flying high into the air. (SORCERER EXCLAlMlNG) And he was never seen again. Then the magic lamp carried them, palace and all, back to Baghdad. The Caliph was overjoyed to see Dinarsarde again. She begged him to forgive Aladdin. And from that time, they lived happily in their palace in the city of Baghdad.
