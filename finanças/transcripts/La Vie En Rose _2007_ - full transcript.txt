I'm listening... I have to go back. I'll be demobilized soon. Then I'll go back to the circus. I came to see my cherub. Get out. I'm all done, Mamma Louise. Tend the door. Where's her mother? I don't know. Want to leave her here? People will gossip. People always gossip. Aren't we taking her to church? We'll miss mass. The earth doesn't revolve around her. Heard we're keeping a baby.

It's me, open up. Your Legionnaire's here. I don't care. He's a liar. He tells me nothing but lies. Titine, stop this right now. Come out or you'll be on the street so fast! Enough of your antics! I don't want trouble. Doug! What? Are you jealous? I sent your Billie Holiday records to the hotel. Thank you, Loulou. Billie and I were born the same year. Funny! I brought my sketches.

Whose child is she? Nobody's. Theresa, I rarely ask anything of you, I only ask that you hear little Edith. Go on, Edith. Speak to her. She'll listen. Go ahead. Theresa, I don't want to be blind. I want to see. She's all bruised. Go on. I want to learn to read, and run like before. I don't want to be blind. Saint Theresa, tell baby Jesus to look after Edith. Go ahead.

You have no right! Don't do this to me! Go! I'll kill myself. We're at Orly airport. Passengers are disembarking. I see her. It's Edith Piaf! A young man's on her arm. What did you bring from America? An American. What's his name? Edith, please! Like her song, she's "carried away by the crowd"... She steps into her elegant black and white car. She looks tired, but is all smiles. Silence! I propose a toast... What a slob! Slob yourself. Indulge the invalid. Watch out accordion man or you'll get a shiner! Perfect timing! Call the boss. I want free champagne! I'm Edith Piaf, and I made a mess. Everyone kiss. Even enemies! Kiss me, Claude. - Who's that broad? - No idea. Who gets the steak tartare? Where did your handsome friend go? Don't embarrass her... Butt out Coquatrix, who rang your bell? Well... Mademoiselle! Miss Piaf, a pleasure! What can I do for you? A lot. I want a present. Naturally. Well... I wanted champagne, but I'll take a ring, a big ring with diamonds studded everywhere. Don't trouble yourself, we'll have champagne. Here's a toast to the love I have for you all. And I'll stand up for that. Give me a hand. I'd like to make a toast to Marguerite. My composer, and my most loyal friend in the business. Don't blush like that, you'll make us cry. You want an autograph? I don't think so. Bubbles and booze, perfect. This is Claude's influence. You're irritating, Loulou. We're just back to Paris, we had some fun. Don't play the broken hearted lover. I'm waiting for someone. Get lost. Let me remind you, you have commitments. You're not alone. Remember the first night at Gerny's? I was a bum. She looked at me like a princess. You were a princess. My princess! To Marguerite! To those who want to see me fall on my face. They think I don't notice! Cheers. Something wrong, Louis? He's having a tantrum. Get lost, we're busy. You don't watch the show. Get busy. You must work. There are no kids here. You have to earn your keep. That's enough. Little turd! You ruined my exit! Go to the trailer. Make dinner. Ladies and gentlemen, a big hand for Louis, the contortionist! She's cute. How old is she? Ten. No mother? What for? You must be lonely. How about some brandy, in your trailer? Come on over. Do you know who I am? I'm Theresa. Are your eyes well, my angel? Yes. You're so sweet. Who'd you like to pray for? I'll pray for Titine. Good girl. I'm watching over you. Never forget. When you're alone, I'll always be there. I've had it! I told you to change that wheel. Don't argue. Just help. We're all in the same shit. - I don't give a damn! - Then get lost! You can't quit. Not over a spat! I wasn't made to take orders. I can't stand Caroli. He is a bad boss. - You're drunk! - I'll go solo. Fat chance! Circuses aren't on every corner. Don't worry. I always land on my feet. You were growing on me. You'll get over it!

Edith, I know it's hard, you need lots and lots of rest and patience. Your husband called today... It's no use. What makes me sick... is that I overdid it. The last three years have been disastrous. You're an artist. Simone? I won't sing again, will I? What are you looking at? I want some chow. We sing for a bit, then we eat. Singing alone's like begging. With you, it's a show. I want to sing there. Hey you! You can't sing in the street. Is that so? - How old are you? - Twenty. What's that? She barely had a sip. Come here.

If ever you need, I'd love to compose for you. Thank you. Come. Edith, this is Mr. Jacques Canetti. Artistic Director of City Radio. Miss, you completely dazzled me. Thank you. Please join us at our table. I can't stay. I have to run. What's so important? Thank you. What is it? Marvelous, marvelous. You better lay off, or it's pow right in the kisser!

Follow me, please. What for? This way. Let me through, please. This way. I'm talking to you! - Are you mixed up with The Mob? - No. Leave me alone. What about Henri Valette? And Georges, Johnny the sailor and Albert... never heard of them either? They're friends... they're not mixed up in this. Aiding and abetting is a crime. I'm not guilty! I didn't do anything! I've lost everything. Where were you last night? I told you, I was out partying... You scum, lousy rats! What you're doing is disgusting! This isn't the stage! It seems you have some unsavory friends, like Albert. I don't know any of them, lnspector. Sure. I wasn't born yesterday. - Hey Sparrow, a statement? - Not now. Let her stew in her shame. Go back to the gutter, little bitch! Leave her alone! It's not her. Get it? Did you sing to get off? It's a funeral. Show some decency! - One last question. - Vultures! Clear off! Out of the way!

You have a farm! I raise pigs. What? Why not? It's true, why not? It's a lovely farm... very modern with fine fat pigs. Who works it when you box? My wife. You have... magnificent hands.

If I don't sing tonight... if I don't sing at least one song, I'll lose all faith in myself. Do you understand? Doctor, do what you must. Not this time, you guys. You expect me to fall on my face, I'm in great shape. Tell your papers it's not my suicide tour! Padam. ♪ Padam, padam, padam ♪ It comes running up behind me ♪ Padam, padam, padam ♪ It tricks me into remembering ♪ Padam, padam, padam ♪ It's a tune that points me... Saint Theresa, first of all thank you... I know you're behind all this. You sent him to me. I've found love, and I know it's your doing. Sweet Jesus, protect Marcel. Go, Marcel! Go now! It's too soon, Edith. No, he'll win. I feel it. - If there's a problem, you'll look bad. - What problem? If there's a problem, I'll call you. Now go. Hurry up! Go, Marcel! One round! Go on, Marcel! Kill him! - What's happening? - Zale's injured. He did it? He's world champion! You look like an angel. Not like a fairy anymore? You are my champion. I want you to be mine for life. Nothing existed before you. It's all gone. Stay with me. My beloved, yesterday before bed, I crossed off a day, a long day, but also short. When the plane took off it took with it my heart, my life, my breath... My sweet boy, my child, my love, your scent lingers in my sheets and my heart sleeps constantly in the arms of sadness. My Darling, I love you. What have you done to make me feel this way? I miss you. I'm blank, listless, as though waiting for something... Hold me close to your heart and know nothing in the world counts more than you. - Return my heart to me. - All of France knows about us. When I'm in a restaurant, they play "La Vie en Rose"... When I see, my love, how attached you are to your wife and children, I feel like going far away, thinking someday you'll be grateful to me. I can't have you all for myself, and can't live without you. God is my witness, in this affair, I ask for nothing. I'm ready to sacrifice all. "If one day life tears you from me," "If you die or are far away" "Though you may love me, I would die too" In three months, that's right, in April... I'll be a hit at the Olympia. With a full house. We'll be flush. Edith, your liver cells are not functioning normally. You've been ill. You need rest. It's serious. I'm just 44. I'm not in the grave yet. With the cancellations, we have no more assets. You're saying it's my fault. That's not it, Edith. It's the tax authority. We owe 120,000 francs as a first installment. It's jaundice! I don't need to convalesce for 100 years. Don't get carried away. I want to perform at the Olympia! Anything else? Yes, we must stop giving in to her. I can't always keep an eye on her. She left the hospital too soon. The Olympia in three months... It's a disaster waiting to happen. She needs these challenges. Not losing propositions. When I am the one who had to tell the insurers it's all cancelled. We must decide for her, that's final. Whether she likes it or not. Edith... I said to myself, Edith it's all over! He's got someone else. You lost him. He was having an affair? Would I be telling you this if he were? After he left the restaurant, I followed him. My Marcel crossed all of New York to eat with an old blind black boxer he had met a few years earlier. Imagine that. Guys like that are hard to come by. My Marcel... My Marcel! That's all you talk about. Nothing else matters. But let me tell you, Ginou, I'll never have him. He'll never be mine. He won't leave his wife and kids. He calls her every single day. I pretend not to notice. I want him to be happy. I'll be back. I could've been Edith Piaf. There's more to life than songs. It's been too long, Marcel! Call Orly. Catch a plane tonight. A long boat journey would kill me. I miss you, Marcel. I can't be apart from you anymore. Maybe I should go back to Paris. Hold on. I'm just Madame's lapdog. Stop. Rum, Coke! Whiskey! Everyone treats me like shit, around here. Boozing it up in Belleville was better. You've dropped me, Edith. Enough, Momone! Get her out of my sight. I'll be taking the boat. Here's to your career, Edith! Please Marcel. Leave tonight. For me! You sleep late when I'm not here. Thank God, Marcel. Thank you. I'll make you some coffee. Don't budge. Let me serve you. What are you doing there? I knew you'd come! Lucien had a rough time buying the tickets. I have a present for you. You're in bad shape. You need sun. You're so pale. Ginou! Ginou. I'm looking for the watch! What's gotten into you? I'm looking for the watch! It was here, in a long red Cartier package. It was here, dammit! What is wrong with you all? I'm looking for Marcel's watch! Where is that watch? I'm looking for Marcel's watch! What? Louis? What's going on? You must be brave, Edith. Is it Marcel? What? The plane crashed... Marcel! ♪ Come what may, ♪ if your love is true ♪ For I will die too ♪ We will live on eternally ♪ In the vast sky of blue ♪ In heaven all is harmony ♪ My love, ♪ Do you believe we love each other? ♪ God reunites ♪ Those who loved before I don't know what else to tell you Miss Piaf. They say you're the best psychic... That may be, but... this is your third visit this week. What more can I say? Why keep coming back? So that you can repeat it to me again, for me to remember why I must go on living. He died in the heavens, so he must be up there... Hey Jack Pills! Can you step on it? I need some air. That's lovely. Step on it. Our pin up's melting! I'll get a sore throat. Then you'll take care of me like a good husband. The best hubby I've had. The first you've had! You plan on gawking at us all day? I'm sick to my stomach. Watch it, you'll ram us into the scenery. Let me drive. Stop, I'll drive. That way Ginou can throw up. Go on, Ginou. May I help Madame... Go on, Ginou! Very good. Bravo! Bye Ginou. Wait for me! You sure know how to drive. At least our outing wasn't for nothing... We killed a tree! Unbelievable, what shitty service! Anybody here to take our order? Calm down, dear. Don't play the star. Tonight you play the Mocambo. Really? Remind me who's invited us tomorrow? Marlon Brando, Ginger Rodgers, Mr. Chaplin... What is that? We never ordered that crap! Don't touch me! - Let me see. - Don't touch me, I said! Wipe yourself off. We'd better get a divorce. How many injections per day, Madame? About ten... Sorry to be so direct, but why are you doing this? So my body will shut up! When did you start these daily injections? Five years ago, after the plane crash. I... I was becoming arthritic. I couldn't knit anymore. You are seriously dependant. An addiction... Doctor, I'd like my wife to go to rehab. I want to get better. I can. October 1960 - 5 years later Danielle, a chair. Edith... Here, Edith. Sit down. Bruno... There'll be no Olympia. I understand, Edith. No! I want you to meet Charles Dumont, composer, and Michel Vaucaire, lyricist. They've come back to play their song.

I read he wasn't in France. He came for you! They've been waiting for 30 minutes. The place is heating up. They're not too tight? Who is that? A friend. Come on Edith, stand up. My cross? My cross... My cross... We forgot it. I'll get it. I won't sing without my cross! Out! Everybody out! Grasse, October 1963 Her last night See you tomorrow. Go on. I'll handle it. I'm afraid, Simone. I'm losing my memory. It's very serious. My thoughts are muddled. I'm trying to remember... but I can't. Other memories are surfacing, not the ones I want to see. I wanted to see his watch. Do you remember? Marcel's watch? No Edith. I didn't know him. I wanted to see his watch. That's some face! You've got wild eyes. The kid's not so bad. Simone. Yes, Edith? I didn't pray. I want to pray on my knees. No one will reproach you if you're not on your knees. I want to pray for my daddy. Marcelle... My little ghost. Only Momone knows about it. I need to tell you about my child. Take it easy, Edith. Marcelle! Marcelle, go to bed. I've had enough today. Think I can keep an eye out for the cops and your kid? What the hell's Louis doing? It's him. Your father. Did she eat? They said you were on the street with her! Who said? You get her twice a month and you screw up! I said not the streets! Come quick! It's Marcelle! Come on! Marcelle's in the hospital! Are you her mother? Meningitis. Nothing could be done. I'm sorry. Edith, I have the cross. Hello. They said you were on the beach. Thank you for granting this interview. My pleasure. It's odd to see you so far from Paris. I'm never far from Paris. I've a list of questions. Just answer with the first thing that comes to mind. Well, what is your favorite color? Blue. What's your favorite dish? Pot roast. Could you accept living a sensible life? I already do. Who are your most faithful friends? My true friends are faithful. If you could no longer sing... I could no longer live. Are you afraid of death? I fear loneliness more. Do you pray? Yes, because I believe in love. I don't want to go, Simone. Where is Theo? I want my husband. Theo will be here in less than an hour. What is your fondest career memory? Every time the curtain goes up. Your fondest memory as a woman? My first kiss. Do you like night time? Yes, with a lot of light. Dawn? With a piano and friends. The evening? For us, it's dawn. See, you're breathing. I can't go back. I can't. If you were to give advice to a woman, what would it be? Love. To a young girl? Love. To a child? Love. Who are you knitting for? Whoever will wear my sweater. That's all. I hope it wasn't too long. Thank you very much.
