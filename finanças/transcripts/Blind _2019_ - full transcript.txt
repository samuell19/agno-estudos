- Welcome to Celebrities Uncovered. I'm your host, Lisa Carmel. Today, we're joined by the lovely Faye Dayne, star of the film "Fog Storm" which opens nationwide in theaters this Friday. Thank you so much for joining us today. I know you were headed to a special needs charity event. We really appreciate you welcoming us into your home. Its my pleasure. - So, yesterday we interviewed Cage regarding his role in "Fog Storm". Tell us a little bit about your character. - Megan is tough, she goes through hell but I love the fact that she never gives up. She always keeps fighting. You seem to have it all. A career that's skyrocketing, a house in the Hollywood hills. - Isn't it beautiful? You should see the sunset, it's amazing. It's probably my favorite part of living here. What's next for you? - Well um, actually I'm taking the next few weeks off. My first real vacation in years. And where you gonna go? You got a boyfriend to take along with you? Milan, Paris? - Actually I plan on staying home and relaxing. I never get to do that. Maybe get laser surgery. I'm so sick of wearing these stupid contacts all the time. Well whatever you decide to do, enjoy your time off. All the buzz is that you've got a really big hit on your hands. All the early reviews say this is gonna be your best film yet. Thank you, so great to hear. - Naturally. Any last words? - Go see "Fog Storm" it's a lot of fun. Coming. ♪ Safe my friend ♪ Are you gonna hold me ♪ Like you did before ♪ Take ♪ The place ♪ Put me on the outside - I think I've got like a bug in my ear, like a gnat flew in my ear and its like in there and I, you know, I can't reach for it, I can't get it out. All these plants. God damn, its like an Amazonian jungle here now I got hair in my mouth. My girlfriend took me to this Italian restaurant. She said, "There's a guy here." She's sighted. "Guy here, he's got a lot of hair in his ear's." Do you think I'm growing hair in my ears? Women don't get the hair in the ears. Do they? Are we here? Its flat, are we here? She said its a nest of hair like... We got it from here. Yeah, I'm going in. I'll be back in an hour for the group meeting. I'll see you soon. - Okay, bye. Here you go, Sophia. - Thank you. Not, sorry. - Its good for you. Exactly. You're thinking. - Think Luke will be upset if I cancel hosting the meeting? - I don't think he'll say anything. - Can you be serious for a moment? - I know, I know, I'm sorry. Look, I, I know that you're nervous, okay, you still have so many memories of your old life. I don't have that problem, I was born this way. You want your old life back, I get it. - I can't help it. - But it keeps you from embracing your new life. - I don't have a new life. - But you could. In case you haven't noticed, Luke's got the hots for you. - No he doesn't. - Does he have to spell it out for you? - Really? - Okay, that was an accident. - How would that even work? A blind girl and a mute guy. - Not gonna know unless you take a leap. Got to take that first step. We have a new member to our group today. Everyone welcome Lydia. - Hi, Lydia. - Hey, Lydia. Lydia, would you like to share your story with us? - I was in a car accident. The man that was driving the car that hit me was intoxicated. I can't remember what he looks like anymore. Funny how that fades with time. But I can still smell his breath if I think hard enough. The stench of bourbon and cigarettes. I hit my head on the steering wheel. I'm not sure why the air bag didn't inflate. A mechanic checked it after the accident and it was in perfect working order. Just one of those things, I guess. I ended up with cerebral hemorrhage. At first, I could see a little but everything was hazy. What I wouldn't give to have that back. A week later, I lost my vision completely. I was left in darkness while the man that hit me he got away without a scratch. But hey I can now smell a donut shop from a mile away so that's that. Losing one sense will lead your remaining senses to heightened awareness. - Bullshit. You'll notice that your sense of hearing will improve. Your sense of taste, your sense of smell. You'll begin to navigate your environment much better. Look at Faye. Today she went on a hike for the first time since she lost her vision. Did you ever think you would do that again? - No. - But you did. All of you are not disabled. You must remember that. You are not handicapped. They are simply labels. You are all so strong, stronger than you know. You can push the body to remarkable heights but nothing can compare to what you can accomplish with your mind when you decide to trust your instincts and focus on bettering yourself. Its difficult, the most difficult thing you will do. You will have many bad days but then you'll have a good day. Those good days will begin to stack up and before you know it, you have a good week, then a good month, then a good year. We all struggle but together we can achieve so much more. - Bullshit. Now that wasn't so bad, was it? How did it feel having a house full of strangers? - My anxiety level is at a 10. - You are a 10. Isn't that right, Luke? Yes! - It was quite the day today. Did you enjoy your hike? - Yes. I'm free tomorrow if you want to do another session. - Sure. You'll join us, too, right, Sophia? - Can't, me and Mark have plans. We aint got shit. - Great, so then its a plan. The three of us again. - Yay. - Call Sophia. Hi, Sophia. - Hey, good morning. You sound tired. I didn't sleep well last night. - Neither did I. - I'm calling to let you know I have to cancel hiking today. Is everything okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I just want to stay in. I was gonna call Luke to let him know but I want to let you know first. - No need, I'm gonna go anyway. You are? - Yeah, I had a great time yesterday. - Okay, I'm sorry. No worries. - Bye. You know, a lot of people are into hiking. I am not one of those people. Then why come? - I'm gonna be brutally honest with you, okay. Somebody's gotta help you and Faye along, you know? I mean, it's like some cheesy romantic comedy, you know? You guys are so sweet it makes my teeth hurt. You're into her, aren't you? Aren't you? Your turn to be honest. Yes, I really like her. - Well she's into you. What's the problem? I don't know how to say it. - Well-- - Shut up. - Look, you treat her like you would treat anyone. Women like appreciation and talking and you know all that stuff. What you really need to give to her is compliment her on her beauty. She thinks she's lost it. That is one of the dumbest things I have ever heard. - Tell her that. She's out of my league. - Luke. May I? Sure. - Wow, that's a lot of hair. Sweetie, you got nothing to be worried about. Believe me, I've felt a lot of men's faces, I know what I'm talking about. What should I do? - I brought something that I think you can use. Its Wisdom Tree, its her favorite scent, drives her crazy. Put a little of that on. When you go into the house, ask to use the bathroom. Then you make her laugh. Oh that's it? - Yeah, laughter. Complete unrestrained, uncontrolled emotion. Counter balances sadness. She's drowning in that right now. ♪ All those times you told me ♪ You're the one for me ♪ So why can't we ♪ Take away the problems ♪ Never let you down ♪ All your tears can fill the ocean ♪ ♪ But I won't let you drown - Give me a sec. Don't say it, Sophia, I know. I wussed out. I'm just not sure I'm ready to date yet. Can I use your bathroom? - Luke, oh my god, I'm sorry. I thought... Yeah, come in. Its, its down the hall to the left. Thank you. - Sorry I was so weird. Speaking of weird, what did one phone say to the other phone? - I don't know. Ring ring. Ha ha ha ha. May I sit down? - Yes. How was the hike? It was great. - That's awesome. Did Sophia leave? She said she had to get home. - I should give her a call. Oh shit. Are you wearing Wisdom Tree? Yes. - I used to love that. Used to? - Its been a long time. I am sorry. - No, its okay. I like it. I'm sorry I didn't go on the hike with you guys today. I couldn't sleep last night. The anniversary of my surgery is coming up and its just a reminder of what I lost. Speaking of lost, do you have my phone? I programmed my cell number as speed dial number three on your phone. If you ever need someone, please reach out. I am a good listener. - Thank you. I didn't realize you were so funny. I always wanted to work on a comedy. It was the last genre on my bucket list. You still could. - No. Those days are long gone. I got to live out my dreams and most people never get that opportunity. I threw it all away for something so stupid. I'm stupid. I should probably get going. - Okay. I will see you at the meeting next week. - Yeah. Goodbye. - Where are you people? God damn it, always so late. Ridiculous. Uh oh. Uh, sorry. Uh, you're on my stick. You're on my stick. What is this? Luke? Where am I? What? Hello? Hello, is anyone here? Hello?

Yes, I'd like an order for delivery. Yes. I'd like to order veggie sushi rolls. No thank you. Yes, charge the card on file. Five dollars. How long will it take? Great, thank you very much. - Sorry, I'm late. You are my last delivery. You're Megan Summers! - That was a fun role. - I've seen "Fog Storm" at least 20 times. The sequel sucked ass, though. Why weren't you in it? - I retired. - That sucks. Fuck, nobody's gonna believe this. Can I get your autograph? - Sure, what's your name? - Its for the credit card transaction. - Of course, I'm sorry. You'll have to guide me. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Have a good night. - Call Sophia. Hey, Sophia. I just realized I never called you. First of all, thank you for blindsiding me today. I made a complete fool of myself and worst of all, I think I made Luke feel bad. Look, I know you're trying to be a good friend and all but, no that's the wrong thing to say. You've been a great friend. I couldn't have made it this far without you and I truly hope you know that. Having you in my life has made me a better person. I wish I could tell this to you and not some stupid machine. Anyway, I wanted to tell you what happened with Luke today and see what you think. Give me a call when you get this, okay? I love you. Yes, I think someone broke into my house. My door was open. No, I've been home all day. Yes. 11587 Deronda Drive. - Good evening, ma'am. We received a call about a break in. - Yes, that was me. - May I come in? - Absolutely. - Ma'am are you, uh, vision impaired? - Yes, I'm blind. - Okay. And um, you live alone? - Yes. - And what makes you think someone broke in? - The door in my bedroom was open. - Where's, uh, where's the bedroom? - Its down the hall to the left. - Ma'am, do any of the lights in the house work? - Maybe, I don't know. - You wait here. What's uh, what's in that room? You'll have to explain what you're looking at. - Oh um, there's a door at the end of the hall. - Storage, I used to go down to the basement but I don't have that ability to go down there anymore. - Okay. Its uh, its all clear. Are you sure you didn't just leave the, uh, door open? - Yes. - Are you positive? - 100 percent. - All right, um. Is anything missing? - A dress. - And you're sure it didn't just get misplaced? - I know this house inside and out. I have to in order to get around. - It must be very difficult. - Are you sure you checked everywhere? - Yes I... I can do it again if it, if it will make you feel better. - No, that's okay. - Is there, uh, is there any other rooms beyond the, uh, dining room? - Just the kitchen but I already went through there. - I'll check it again anyways. Well, everything's fine in there. Do you normally lock your doors? - Yes but I've been stressed lately. I might have forgotten. - I know we're up in the hills and its a tendency to think that we're safe. This is still Los Angeles. - I've dealt with stalkers before. I know it all too well. I thought you looked familiar. - Typical, right? Another crazy Hollywood actress. - Are you gonna be okay, ma'am? Is there someone I can call? No, I'll be okay. - All right I'll, I'll canvas the neighborhood just to be safe. Its probably just some kids or some super fan trying to get a memento. Keep your doors locked, okay? - Thank you. - You have a great night.

Hi, Luke, its Faye. I just wanted to call and say I was sorry about earlier. I know. I just feel silly. Um. I was wondering if you wanted to come over. I know its getting late but... Okay. I'll see you soon. Bye. ♪ My secret love ♪ Oh my secret love Luke, you smell nice. Come in. I have something to say to you and please hear me out. This is very difficult for me and I'm afraid if I stop I'll never find the courage to start again. I've lived in the public eye for so long that I became accustomed to always being looked at. No matter where I went, what I did I could always sense eyes on me and I was fine with that. I knew what I was getting into when I chose to be an actress. Vanity is a part of this whole thing. Its all about who you know, what you have, how you look. I bought into it. Hook, line, and sinker. I let something as stupid as wearing glasses affect my whole life. And now, I always have to wear glasses when I go out. Not that I go out much. I've locked myself away. Film was my life. I lived for it. Some of my favorite childhood memories are tied to the cinema. I dreamed of seeing myself on the big screen. And now, I can't see myself at all. I was always self conscious. I would spend hours getting ready, trying to make everything perfect but I've realized nothings perfect. We all have our flaws and we can't let that define us. You've helped me realize that. I never allowed myself to be happy because I can't let go of the past. But I'm ready. I've achieved my dreams. I've made it. Even though I lost my eyesight I can still see that. I can also see that there have been two bright lights within my darkness. Sophia's been my rock. She's been there for me like no other friend I've ever had. I wouldn't be here without her. And you, Luke. You've been a highlight of my life. I never thought I'd meet someone that would make me feel like living again. You make me want to go out there and show the world that I'm still alive. I'm still alive. I want to embrace the future. I want to embrace it with you. Not by leading me. But by my side. What I'm trying to say is I think I love you. You don't have to say anything. If you want to join me in this journey called life. Please take my hand. I haven't been able to do this since... I felt ugly. I felt like a monster. I never thought I'd let another man look at me. But I want you to. I want you to see me. All of me.
