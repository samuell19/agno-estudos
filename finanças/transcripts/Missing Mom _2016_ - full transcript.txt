Hello? - Hey Uncle Rob, listen, I'm gonna be in Ontario the first few weeks in November and I'm starting another documentary. I'm actually gonna see if I can track down my mom. Oh, good luck on that one. This is my mom, Terri Lee Parker, and this is the last image we have of her, because on the night of October 27th, 1990, she vanished. I was only eight years old, and no one has seen her since. - A lot of kids who don't know their biological parents really feel they need to find out where they came from, and I understand that. Those of us who have that in our past take it for granted, I think, and so I think it's normal for kids to want that and young adults, adults to want that and sort of find their roots and figure out who they are. But, it may not be what they want. - Well I'm sure it's hard not knowing what happened to her. He may finally be able to get some closure. It's hard to make the decision right now to go after her, but you don't know what the outcome's gonna be. I don't know how he's gonna react to it, good or bad. - I don't know what's gonna happen. I mean, it very well be we don't find anything. We could possibly find her, and we could find out that she's no more, she could be dead. And you know what? All of those possibilities are okay. I'm a firm believer it is, all of it the journey, not the destination. But it'd be great to have some answers. - I met him in grade one, and it was interesting circumstances that brought him to London. I can't recall where he came from in Ontario, but he kinda just arrived in grade one. We quickly became friends as he did with some of our other pals that we're still close with today. - When he was younger, especially, you could see anger issues. - Ah, Rob was very strong-minded, potentially confrontational with authority, teachers and principals. - Rob really hasn't changed that much since I met him as a kid. - You didn't really think about it, you didn't really notice it 'cause his grandparents were great, and to me they were his parents, but at the same time, knowing him, there was this void. - Everyone else had a mother or father, and Rob had his grandparents. His parents were absent his entire childhood. - I recall meeting his mom once, I think. I recall being in his kitchen and I met his mom, and then, nothing, just vanished. - So I can understand going on this quest for him. Why not, why wouldn't you wanna know? How could you live the rest of your life not knowing? - It's the strongest connection left to him but, is there a connection? What is this gonna turn up? - Once he sets his mind on something, he's gonna follow through to the end. And, I think as a result he's gonna find the answers that he's looking for in this case. - This quest is gonna have many phases or components, but the first phase is the research phase. It's where I'm hoping to gather as much information as possible, because right now, I don't even have a starting point to look for my mom. Here's what's gonna happen for the next 17 days. I'm gonna talk with my grandparents, Norm and Carol, my uncle Rob, and my best friend Jay. Then I'm gonna travel to Windsor to see my aunt Kelly and my grandma, Mary. After that, I'm gonna rendezvous with my brother Chris who's flying in from Thompson, Manitoba to join our trek, and with him on board, we'll get to talk to his dad, Rick, who was married to our mom. We'll also get to talk to Chris's grandpa, Ross. On the film side is Ryan Daniszewski, who's filming most of this, and Jordan Morris is co-directing and producing as well as acting as my confidant and, from time to time, the voice of reason. So, I'm in London, Ontario, back home again. It's decidedly fall outside, and gearin' up for all these interviews. I can tell people are a little excited and a little anxious. My grandma's already tryin' to start talkin' to me about stuff, which is kind of insane. It's never been officially, you know, a taboo subject but now that I've expressed interest in talking about it, the gates are open. - Okay, the last time I saw my daughter was at her father's 50th birthday, which would be 24 years ago. - Oh, she was fun, she really was. She was, off-the-wall crazy too, though. She always made me nervous. 'Cause she was always one to try and push the limits as far as she could push them. - She started skating when she was four years old. - She loved skating. She would get up in the morning, and you never had to wake her twice. She would get up, off to the rink, work like a dog, come home, go to school, she was a good student. Never a moment's problem in that respect. She had a lotta good friends, never had any problems. - She was smart. Everything came easy to her. - I used to get phone calls, in the evening, afternoon sometime, mostly in the evening. I would get phone calls from people who obviously knew her, and there was a lot of derogatory comments made over the telephone, which I'd never reveal. My wife doesn't even know that. - Her biggest fault was boys. - You know, growing up as a teenager and that, I never seen her with any drugs or anything. I know she smoked. - Alcohol started disappearing. I know that for a fact. - She turned to other things or other people outside of the family who made her feel very different. - She had left and disappeared, I know that, and then she kinda surfaced. She was going by the name of Lee. - So we didn't know that either. It was almost like she had taken on this other identity. - That was not her name. I mean, well, it was her name, it was her middle name, but it was not the name that we knew her by. - Once she married Rob's dad, I didn't see her very much after that. - I don't even remember how she met David. I don't even remember that piece. - I had more respect for David than I had for my daughter. I thought, you know, I looked at him and I didn't say anything, and I was thinking to myself, "How the hell did you get yourself in this position?" - I always wish I knew what happened to her 'cause she was important to me. - Being a mother, the worst thing always goes through your mind first. - She's probably dead, or she could be dead. We don't know. - If she only knew, how many people love her unconditionally. - I'm probably cold-hearted about the whole thing, but if I never see her again, I could care less. While we were only hoping to get an idea on my mom's character and past during the opening round of interviews, we unexpectedly got a lead from my uncle that she was seen in Collingwood, Ontario about 10 years ago. Starting the hunt this early was never part of our plan, but this was too good to ignore. We had to follow it all the way to the end. - Probably around 10 years ago, but a buddy of mine who is a police officer with the OPP so I know he's pretty good with face recognition, he was, I don't know if it was a ski trip or what but he was up in the Collingwood area and he was pretty positive at the time that he had seen my sister. He didn't confront her or anything 'cause it was, I don't know if he seen her while he was driving or in a store or a restaurant, he never really got to that detail. He just told me, it was a matter of factly, you know, "I think I seen your sister up in Collingwood." My friend's been with the police force a long time, and when he was with a couple of the smaller cities he was actually able to go on and try and track her down for me. He's tried probably five, six times in the past over the years, and never had any luck trying to locate her. Well, he grew up with me. We had been friends since we were about 10 years old, so he was quite familiar with my sister growing up. He knew that she had her first marriage last name McCallum, second marriage last name Byford. Sometimes she liked to go by her middle name, Lee, so it could be any combination of Lee Byford, Lee McCallum, Terri Byford, Terri McCallum. - This is Rob McCallum, I'm Rob Parker's nephew. You may or may not have heard what I'm trying to do, I'm trying to track down my mother, Rob Parker's sister, and I heard that you may or may not have had somewhat of an encounter, and just off the record I would love to hear it kinda firsthand to see what it is. Obviously, nothing on you about how legitimate it is, but I'm just trying to get every scrap of evidence, because as you know probably it's a bit of a mystery and any information could be super helpful whether it's now or down the road. So hopefully you can help me out a little bit. Just give us a call back. I'm at my uncle's house right now. We'll be here most of the night, and if you can't get back to us tonight maybe I'll try ya again later on through the week. Thanks so much, I appreciate it, bye. I didn't meet my dad till I was 10 years old, and we didn't really have an amazing relationship. We tried to see eye to eye, but it could just never really work the way that that relationship should work. Now that I'm trying to find my mom, I'm wondering if we'll ever be able to have a good relationship, or if the events of the past are really too hard to overcome. - David walked in the office all smiles and he says, "You'll never guess what happened." Then he told me that Rob Parker was gonna make arrangements for him to meet his son. - And I just called him and basically said, "Look, your son's asking a lot of questions. "You haven't been in the picture and you haven't called, "so I'm gonna do one of two things. "One, if you don't want to have any contact with your son, "I won't tell him I ever found you, "but if you do want contact with him, "now's the time to step up and give him a call or visit." I think it was only a matter of about two weeks later that he got to see his dad again. - I remember driving up to London, and David was feeling very nervous about it. He wasn't sure how Robby was going to react to him. I think he really worried about if Robby was going to ever forgive him for what he did. - There was a lotta disappointing trips where Rob would go and visit his dad for a weekend or a week, and he'd be excited for it. By the time he got back, he would be so over it and hoping that he wouldn't have to go see his dad for another year. - When it came to Robby wanting his way and Dave wanting his way, yep, they would butt heads all right. - We moved down to Houston right after we got married. Rob's dad helped us build a house down there and it was in the same neighborhood where they lived, so we all lived really close, like almost across the street. And then later on, Nelson and his family moved down. Rob was never into hunting, but Nelson and Dave went hunting quite often. One weekend, Nelson and Dave went hunting. - It was late in the night. We were sittin' around the campfire, havin' some beer, and I wanted to go hunting in the morning 'cause I like to hunt in the morning, he didn't. He'd stay up, skip the morning hunt. So I went to bed and then, I don't remember how much longer after, but, there was another gentleman with us and he come running in the house and woke me up and told me there was an accident and I need to get up. When I got up, I ran outside and our dad, he was on fire. - We got a call really early on a Sunday morning and it was Donna. She was down at the hospital in Houston, and she said that David had been in an accident and that he had burns all over his body. I just remember Rob saying, "Why does it have to be burns?" I think he was freaked out. I think he was afraid to see him after that. - Soon after that he went into a coma, and then never talked to him again. When he left the camp, I never seen him again. - My heart really went out to Robby because, David was all he really had then. And not to have a mother, and only a father, and then to lose your father, it was really hard. Then also to make the decision to pull the plug on his dad. Are we goin' for sure? We made that plan official? - Yeah, it's only a matter of time, but we're goin'. I'm in the process right now of writing down all the major restaurants that we could find at least off the main strip anyway, which will give us most of the eateries in that region. I think what we're gonna do once we get up there is to attack spots like that which all represent trying to interrupt someone's daily routine. How many are we at? - 59. And a bunch of these are Wendys, there's several Starbucks. - Does that include hotels, or no? No. - So that's just restaurants, 59 restaurants. - With chains, with Timmy's, Starbucks, that kind of stuff in there as well. - And we had talked about making a flyer. - Yeah, actually leaving posters behind, have you seen this person? Missing mom, and details on her, the most recent photo that you have of her, and traits, you know, like she has been a server, she has been an accomplished figure skater, anything else that we can throw in there and see what kind of a hit we can get. And we gotta hit it all, so my concern is that it's a smaller town but there's still lots of restaurants. - How big is Collingwood? Do you have a population? - I don't have that yet. Let me find that out right now. - It should say, it should say over here. Oh, up here. Up, population, just under 20,000 as of 2011. The big question is, is how much time do we have for this trip to Collingwood that we can manage and pull off? I mean, I haven't even run this past my brother yet, right? He might say, "You guys are just wasting time, "you guys are going up there on a rumor "that's changed from four to 10 years "and you just hope to get lucky "by putting posters up there." It would be tough, it would be tough to do them all in one day. - So, from London how far of a drive is it? Three hours. - 246 kilometers, which is about 180 miles? So we got the poster, and it's walking in and saying, "Hi, I'm looking for a missing person, "I haven't seen my mom in a long time "but it was rumored she was here four to six, 10 years ago. "Have you seen her?" Whatever the answer is... Do you have any advice as well? - Do you have any advice, can I leave this here with you, and can we post this? Will you allow us to post this? - So Jordan and I put, missing person. Hey friends, need a favor. Anyone have connections to people of influence or people that are connected to the Collingwood, Ontario area? I'm looking for my mom, she was last seen in this area four to 10 years ago. Anything could be possible, but need your help. Sound good? Yeah, that sounds great. - This app is supposed to allow you to see what somebody's look like when they're a bit older. It's the new version of hiring a sketch artist. I may go online and see what I can get as well, 'cause it's a little comedic, I think, but. Well, as long as we're up front about the fact that there's no science behind it. Yeah. It's fine. - So. Okay, so. That's there now on Twitter. That's creepy. Woah! Isn't that freaky? Oh man, I can't. Regardless of, but like, watch this. Oh, yeah, I saw her move, geez. - There is no Dana, only Zuul. It feels real all of a sudden, man, now that people are lookin' at this on Facebook. Yeah, you're out there now. - Like, it's one thing to go around and get family stories, right? Yep. - And, just to see these two people share it on Facebook, it's like, wow, people care. Which I'm super comfortable with, obviously. I mean, this is like the ultimate fear now, 'cause now people are gonna ask on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram, and that's kind of what we want, but now it's, all those years defending this whole thing as a kid, like saying, "Oh no, my mom is gone," and ending the subject. Not no more. Yeah. One in the morning, I get a message, and it was, I went to high school with your mom and I know where she is. She goes by this name now. - What? - Yeah. - Well, I could tell by your text that you had a solid lead, but that's way more than solid. That's way more than a lead. We know where she is. Like, how close are you to having an address, even? - Kitchener, LinkedIn profile. - Kitchener? - And workplace. - So obviously you went online and looked? - Yeah, went online and looked, Facebook profile. - Picture? - Yeah. - Jesus, man, that's amazing. - I don't, I don't 100% buy it. - You don't think it's the same person? - No. Definite similarities, a few different facial things like a mole on the face that wasn't on, that I never saw it with my mom. - Well, that's a long time. - Stuff can happen. - Absolutely. - I mean, sunburn can leave that kinda thing. - Sunburn, smoking. - And then this morning, at 9:30am, I get another message from another party that eventually was the one that prompted each of these two parties last night. So there's like this person at the top who shared this with everyone, and the two people contacted me based on that initial person. So this initial person said, "Someone messaged me, "she's living in a hotel in East London." What? - I had a friend say that he knew her, this guy named Bud, and she's living in a hotel in East London. Flash forward to 10:15, I get a message, "Hi, someone says you're looking for me "but I don't know if I know you." And, little bit stronger facial feature resemblance than before, but again, things not lining up. Like, this person's only 46. She lived in Collingwood briefly in the mid 80s, though, was born from London. - So probably not her. - Probably not. - I mean, the age alone. - Well, and yeah, the age alone, but like everything else. This person looks like this person, this person looks like this person. - Damn. - So imagine that going through my head. I mean, I didn't go to sleep til 4:00am because it's like, holy crap. - Well especially the one, like, hi, do I know you? - Yeah, and that was this morning as I was driving here. I'm like, do I look at it, do I not look at it? 'Cause if we're not Facebook friends, so it's not like I can see her profile or anything other than the basic page. - Well I wanna see all of these people. - Sure. Jordan took a look at all the messages and social media hits and agreed that no one had a strong enough case to be my mom, but regardless of all that buzz, I had something else I had to get off my chest. I think I'm gonna give it a year. I think that's the timeline. - And then, if nothing comes... - Walk away. - Put it to bed. - So from my, essentially, birthday to birthday. - Mm hmm. - How do you feel about that? - No, you can't have it draggin' around behind ya forever, so that seems healthy, sure. One year. I think there's gonna be a lot of activity in a year, especially if you keep pushin'. - Well that's just it, right? If you can't do it in a year. And it's only gonna take a few months to really start spoolin' up and getting social, to, like I say, to make it more of a viral thing. - Yeah. - And if more pictures from Collingwood... Emerge or anywhere. - Like, even that later, that could prove to be really interesting. Chris flew into town and we were eager to add him to the mix. He's an RCMP officer, a Mountie, and he's got a level head for these kinda situations. Truth be told, Chris is my half brother. We have the same mom, but different dads. When that marriage failed, Chris went to his dad's parents and I went to our mom's parents, so we were each raised by our grandparents. - Everyone has the same question, even now. Where's mom and dad? The only answer I can give 'em is, dad lives in Penetang and we have no idea where my mother is, and she's been missing for, since I was three years old. Mom went missing, and grandma and grandpa Byford and grandma and grandpa Parker were right there, assumed control right away, no questions asked. It's unfathomable to think about because it's a mother, like, what mother would do that? - I think it's particularly difficult in a family where no one really knows, when no one really knows, because then everybody makes up their own story. As a kid, you don't know what to believe, and so you glom onto something that's somewhat reasonable or the best story that you think you can believe in, and choose that one until maybe you're a little older and hear something else, and then you might choose another one. So it's a little crazy making, you know? What's the real story? - So we're off to the OPP. There was one more lead from social media last night. Someone reached out from Collingwood who said they used to work with our mom at Kelsey's, and now he's a police officer up there. And if we can give him some information, he will do everything in his power to help us. He said, "Boy, she was a lot of fun to work with." So how do you feel about that, Chris? Well, it's good to have someone on our side. - So here's... - Knows what we're talking about. - So here's my concern, right, we're gonna go talk to the OPP right now and this is what I mentioned to you just before we got in the car. Maybe we have to pay two stops to the OPP. One to see if there's anything on record and then see what information we can come away with, talk to other people in the family, and then open up a missing case, or a missing persons report thing. But I don't wanna compromise what the OPP might be trying to do if this guy in Collingwood starts trying to do stuff for us. - Well, when the file is created, he can easily, like, 'cause they're gonna wanna talk to people in Collingwood, I'm assuming, 'cause she lived there. And if people know her, they're gonna wanna talk to those people, and he would be an invaluable resource in that capacity, in my opinion, because he worked with her. Yeah, can't he just openly contribute to the case? - Yes, he can. - Okay, so... - But they would need to know him, 'cause as of right now they won't know who he is, right? - Right. - So they won't know he's a resource to pull on. - Yeah. For a whole bunch of reasons, mainly privacy laws, the officer that talked to us couldn't give us much info, but he did give us one little bread crumb. Someone by the name of Lee Byford was mentioned as a reportee on a file in 1994, but he couldn't tell us where that file was generated or the nature of the report. So Chris, give us a brief explanation of what we're trying to do, without specifics. - I am gonna text a friend of mine to see what she can find out about what we just learned. Essentially, it's just a shot in the dark that we might be able to pull up whatever was being looked at. Okay. - The idea that the last reported sighting might have just gotten five years fresher and possibly be in a totally different direction than what we were about to pursue freaks me out, 'cause we're throwing everything we have, limited resources wise, you know, time, money, all that, we're trying to cover the best ground that we can and if we're just throwin' a net over the wrong part of Ontario, we're gonna get nowhere. So, it's really important that we figure out as much as we can based on the information. There's zero guarantees of anything. One of the hardest parts about this for Chris is that he has no memories of our childhood or our mother, nothing, so I wanted to help him with that and show him some home movies that I recently discovered. Go catch up to Robby, Chris. Where ya goin', Chris? - We're following this path. Those are wild onions, Rob. Uncle Robby had to eat them for a survival course. - You can eat that. Tastes like an onion. Mm, how nice. - Wanna bite? No. - Eat this bite, it's onion! Want an onion? Take a bite of it, Chris. Robby. Robby. - Yeah? Don't force him. - Why? Wanna try it, Chris? - No. I got one. How ya like that, Chris? He's biting, taking a bite of it! Yep. What's it taste like? - Looks like we were normal kids at that point. It's neat to watch, especially when you know who's there but you don't have memory of that. It's very cool. There isn't much video of our past or even other family events. One thing I did find was the last appearance of our mom in October of 1990. No real set for this one either. It's amazing what you find. Over the hill. - I see that. See who that was? - Very good. That was the last time anyone ever saw her, that we can think of. It's weird. I don't know, I have no memory of her. It's something that I didn't even think existed. - It's just crazy to wrap your head around everything we've heard, and then to see that. - Again, we've only seen still photos, or at least I've only ever seen a still photo, which is always, like, wedding photos where it's obviously a very happy moment but it's static, there's no movement, no life to it. You're right, it's very much, it's a live person smiling and looking like they're having a good time. So yeah, it's a different way of looking at it, for sure. - I mean, we've talked about the last few days this idea that maybe it was, don't come back, you know, directly or indirectly implied that if she came back it would be bad for everybody so maybe that's why she left. But then, if this is the last moment, did that moment happen that night? - The plot thickens. All right, what's goin' on? - I just received an email from a friend who says that she was able to, look up a Lee Byford with the same date of birth and it's a Toronto Police Department. Jesus. What do you think that means? - She's now in a city of, what, two million people? In 1994. All right, a friend of mine there did some digging on our little bit of a lead there yesterday. - Yep. - And, she discovered that it was a general occurrence in Toronto for Lee Byford in 1994, and I have a file number as well. - So no address or anything? - No address, not on that system. Toronto would probably have that. - So if we went to the Toronto service and dug, we might find a fuller, more complete file. Yes. 'Cause we have a file number now. - That sounds promising, yeah? Yeah, Chris said that we need to do an ATIP in Toronto. - Yeah. - And now that you know the service, you can throw 'em all over Ontario. - Yeah, about right. - And we just happen to be driving through Toronto. - We can stop at a police station in Toronto. Guess we can just park anywhere, right? But? Or her names or anything. - Yeah, like that's really what it is. What are you thinkin', buddy? - I'm not thinkin' really anything, I'm just, I guess I am thinking. What can we do without, getting anyone in trouble? I don't wanna, that's not my goal here. I wanna be able to just get this information easily and that's all, that's it. - It's just really frustrating for me. These people are doing their jobs, and I get it, that there's laws in place to protect people's private information. I wouldn't want my phone number, address given out either, but at the same time, I feel like they're lookin' behind the curtain and see that information on a computer screen, and we're that close and they won't say anything. It's so frustrating that it's a digital file on a server, and it's right there. - Yeah. - It's aggravating. Even with our stop in Toronto being a bust, we still had an important interview ahead with Rick Byford, Chris's dad, in Penetanguishene, Ontario. This interview could lead to a lot of key information as he may have known our mom best out of anyone so far. - My dad is, he's an interesting guy. I've often described him, and I don't wanna make it sound bad, as a big kid. It's disappointing the fact that he's been there my whole life, but only at arm's reach. Can I say I'm particularly proud of that? No, I think he could've done more, but am I gonna fault him on it? No, I don't think he was prepared to be a father to begin with. I believe my dad kept me at arm's reach for the very reason that I reminded him of this person who abandoned him, and I think that's really what it is, it's abandonment. He was left high and dry, and I'm what reminds him of that. - First time I met Lee, she was a waitress at the Desert Inn in Guelph, Ontario and I was a cook there. That was basically how we met and had a little whirlwind romance there, and got married fairly soon after. When you're working in the hospitality industry, you're mostly working all the time. You know, after work then you go out for drinks and party and do it all over again. There's not really a lot of dating going on. She was bubbly, she was always happy, she was a good worker. I mean, she was pretty. The marriage proposal was basically she told me she wanted a ring, and I got it. Went to Collingwood to the Cranberry Inn and she was behind me there, and then it was, after a couple of years I started lookin' for a job again. Wounded up in Parry Sound at the Rocky Crest Resort. She woulda known she was pregnant, I guess, probably two months after we were married. Must've been, it had to be that close. Went off the pill and didn't tell me and bingo, she was pregnant, right? Like, you know, she wasn't comin' home at night and stuff like that. "Oh, I fell asleep at my friend's," and blah, blah, blah. That's when we weren't working at the same resort. She had taken a job at another resort, and then she did it again one night, went somewhere after work and came home in the wee, wee, wee hours of the morning, and it was like, "This is your last chance now "that you've just used it. "It better not happen again." And then two days later, it happened again, two or three days later, and that was that. We weren't really together for all that long, really. It was like three and a half years, maybe, that we were together, maybe not even that long. I don't really know why nobody ever tried to look for her. I don't know. - And so I don't know if the boys at all have really talked about this openly and honestly, about their differences and the different perspectives they have of their mother. But if I was a therapist seeing them, I might wanna start there. They each have their own individual issues connected to her, but there's a common bond that they also have connected to the trauma of their mother not being in their life, and it is a trauma. - Can you forgive her? - I don't think I have anything to forgive. 'Cause, again, this is all your memories of her and your battle with those memories and feelings. I think I've grown up enough to be like, I didn't have any control of any of that. I'm not looking for forgiveness. I'm just, it's curiosity for me. - I'm angry for what they did to you, I know that. - Then maybe it's a good thing that I don't remember. Maybe I blocked that out. - It could be a good thing. - Where would I be if I was angry with it? I wouldn't probably wanna do this. - What do you hope you find, man? 'Cause I, I don't know what I want to find, let alone what I think I might find. - What is it you hope you find? - I don't know. I hope I find, not answers and not even closure. I mean, I already have some understanding which is something I didn't have before. I have that picture that I can paint. - Do you think you need this? Like you can't go on without it? - There's so much more to learn. Everything has really been fog and mist that we've got so far, and we haven't found a definite truth, and the only way that we'll really know who she is, I think, is by meeting her. And I wanna know who this person is, and it's not about finding a villain, it's not about finding a hero, it's not even about finding a mom. - Hey, you know what, I'm with you on that. She chose to separate from us, and I don't think we're gonna give her a choice. She will have to confront us, if we get to that point. - Right. - She'll have to deal with that. Whether or not it goes on from there is gonna be, is another story I'm assuming. - If she started a new family, that doesn't mean that those people made those choices, and us coming into that life could rock their world. That might force her to run again, right? And then they'll be in the same position of us, and at what point does the cycle stop? When do people stop running? It's a hard question to answer. We only got a few days left. It seems that the direction that police have been asking us to go is with either a PI or the Salvation Army, so bearing that in mind, that's where we're gonna go from here. - Our friend from the Collingwood area, who was gonna help us behind the scenes and asked to remain anonymous has just reached out after a couple days of silence. He did say he'd be at work on Thursday so we'll see what he found, being today, and we'll get in touch. He wants to call, and I just asked him when he wants that to happen. - Hi there, this is Rob McCallum. - Right. - Yeah. - Yeah, we went to the OPP to try to see if there was anything ever opened by our family. - Nothin'. - Right. - No. Yeah, I mean, we've... - Well that's just it, she was such a traveler. She was never really in any one place for more than a couple years, and we can't find a single confidant at really any point in her entire life 'cause she would just move from group to group, and even when she was in the Collingwood area and married to her second husband, she had six or seven jobs all up in Collingwood and Thornbury and MacTier and Owen Sound and Parry Sound. - I have no idea. It's quite possible, there were suggestions that part of the reason she had kids and wanted both my brother and I around even though she wasn't maybe capable of raising us was to get some social assistance out of it. - Sure. - Okay, I appreciate it, thanks. - Bye. Well, he didn't get any more information. Just as we were startin' to talk about that case file, before we could even get into the case file stuff he got pulled away. So at least we're all on the same page so far that maybe that '94 report thing was the last of it. He's gonna call me back. It sounds like he didn't wanna cut that off. So that's cool, and maybe he can get us some more information with what he's got access to, but if he's OPP, up there in northern Ontario, then he maybe has what OPP down here in London saw, which isn't enough to get more information so we're still pushin' for that inner Toronto lead. It's pretty funny though, right? He said the same thing: she had to have had a confidant, she had to have had a best friend, but we haven't found any. - Nope. We have... I still find that weird. - We don't have much goin' on our side. I'm not giving up or anything by any means, but we've got some solid options. The thing is, everything that we've got really needs to produce something to go forward. Yeah, we're stalled out unless we can get into that file and find the next crumb. - Yeah. Hello? Hello. Next we went to see Ross. Ross is Chris's grandpa, and we're hoping he can fill in some more of the story about our mom. Ross also has a cousin, also named Rob, who works for the Toronto Police Force, so we're hoping to give him a call and see if he has any suggestions about learning more about that report that was filed in 1994. - Carol got hold of Prudence and she said, "I've got Lee here," I guess it was in Toronto, "And she wants to see Chris." So, my wife said, "If you wanna see Chris, okay. "I'm gonna see her first." And she went and saw her, and she said, "Lee, I'm sorry, "if you can't get yourself cleaned up, "then you're not gonna see him." And we, as far as we're concerned, never heard from her again. As far as I know, her last known appearance was at Wonderland. Canada's Wonderland is an amusement park just north of Toronto in Vaughan, Ontario. In addition to roller coasters and thrill rides, there are a number of musical acts, singing groups, diving shows, and figure skating performances on display. - Carol told me that she had met one of Lee's school friends and the school friend had said that they had seen her at Wonderland. She went, Carol went up and tried to trace her from there, from Wonderland. I guess, well Wonderland closes over the winter, so the previous year the girl had met her, Carol met the girl and then Carol either after Wonderland was open for the next season, she wasn't working there anymore. If she was actually at Wonderland, then she did stay around Toronto for a period of time. Hello? - Hello, is Rob there please? Yes. - Can I speak to him? Okay. Daddy! Hello? - Hi there Rob, it's Chris. Hey, what's goin' on? - Oh not too bad, long time no see. I know. - Where've you been? I've been here, where have you been? - Well I've been in the great white North. Keepin' the North strong and free. Right. - So, me and my brother, my brother's a filmmaker. One of the things we uncovered throughout all of this was a file that came up in Toronto, with her name and date of birth. Okay. - In 1994. I know it's 20 years ago, but really that's the only lead we've had since. So there was no ever any missing person's file, per se, like you would hope there would be one, but there isn't. And I was just wondering if you were able to look into it for me. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So what do you think about that? - That's awesome. - How are you feelin' right now? - Excited. - Why? - Because he's more than willing to look into it for us and check in and do whatever he can to help us at that end, and then give us an update. Unfortunately it's gonna be after, but that's... But it's in the works. - But it's in the works, and it sounds like it's a good start, but he won't be back into work until it sounds like Monday. - I'll be the negative guy saying it sucks I leave Monday. - It ain't over on Monday, it ain't over on Monday. It's been 25 years. Another couple of months isn't gonna kill anyone. - I can't imagine a better case scenario, really, than that. - So? - There's still no guarantee about anything in that file. - Here's the question. Here's the bigger question. - What? - What do we do Saturday? - Collingwood. - Collingwood. In what capacity? A combination, like you said. - I think we should try, go and see if we can talk to anyone, just to talk to them, get our faces out there saying this is what's happening, generate hype for this Kickstarter. Being like, it started in their community and I think we can get people on board with that. - So we're at 50 kilometers, 30 miles outside of Collingwood, northern Ontario. This is the last place anybody saw her so we decided that we're gonna print off a bunch of these, we got 200 flyers ready to hand out. We're gonna go it all the restaurants that we know because she worked in the hospitality, service industry, maybe a couple hotels. Interrupt the daily life of people who are in coffee shops, that's where we're gonna hope to hit them, pass these out, and see what leads we can find. Oh, not bad, how are you doin'? Hoping that you can help us with something. We're conducting a missing person search. Nah, well, not too bad. We're hoping you can help us out. We're conducting a missing persons search. Our mom disappeared like 25 years ago, but someone said they saw her in the four to 10 year region in this area, which is where we grew up in the mid 80s. We're actually wondering if you can help us out. We're conducting a missing persons search. My mom went missing 25 years ago, so I live in Las Vegas, my brother lives north of Winnipeg. He's hitting another restaurant 'cause she worked as a waitress and stuff, and we have a flyer and we're wondering if we can post it or give it to you. So, we just stopped in a restaurant that's only been here a year, but the guy that's up there, who tends bar here, says he's seen her at Blue Mountain. He says, "She looks familiar, go to Blue Mountain," he gave us a contact, gave us someone to check, so after we hit a few more on here we're definitely gonna head up to the mountain and check the Blue Mountain Inn or the conference center where this manager of food and beverage is, and try to talk to that person and see if we can get a lead. He swears that he may have seen her within a year. So we're outside Kelsey's. We had lunch here. This is where our mom used to work about 23, 24 years ago, and we're about to talk to somebody who had just punched in the clock, so he's about to start his shift, and he worked here about 20 years ago so there's a chance that there's some overlap between the two. It's the last shot at the end of the day, hopefully that we can get some information out of this guy and end the day on a positive note, but we've done a good job, I think, papering the town and success will only really be determined on what happened going forward from here, so let's hope we get lucky and see what happens. I have a lot of mixed feelings about being back in Collingwood, because the years that I lived there were probably the worst years of my entire life. - Chris was born, and they were living in Thornbury. Okay, you're gonna get your life together. Now, she got a new husband now, this is the second husband. Gonna get her life together and they're gonna do this and they're gonna do that, and I said okay, we'll let Rob go live with you for, see how things work out. - I gave him my Battle Armor He-man. I'm just like, you know, take this with you, and I remember just crying and crying and going home. - They were kids, I mean, well, a baby. I could relate more to Rob because, you know, he liked his Masters of the Universe stuff and I used to like sittin' there watchin' the shows with him. Our family life, between the three of us, was pretty good. A lotta times the question was, well, where's mom? Well, she's at work, she's somewhere, I don't know. - And then, over time, I would say, started to get neglectful. - We did send money up because we wanted to make sure the kids, there was not much in their cupboards up there when we went for a visit. - The husband was busy working long hours, strange hours, never came home. Like, he was there at mealtime so he ate all his meals at the resort, if you wanna say, so he wasn't hungry. - We don't have anything for supper or somethin' like that, and I'd have to leave work, go get somethin' for them for supper, bring it to them. - Robby and Chris would come down with the father or with them. They kinda, Robby would kinda raid the cupboard 'cause he wanted to take food back home, kinda the caretaker, looking after the little brother. - I don't know what the mother was doing at that time, whether she was working or whether she was just out diddling around or something, but they had a babysitter that was looking after the kids. I think she was supposed to be working somewhere, I have no idea where. - But we got a feeling that, geez, why are the boys hungry? - There was never any food in the house for the kids to eat, and the babysitter was, you know, it was just deplorable. - I had no qualms about getting him because we still had custody, but working for a lawyer, the first thing he said to me, he says, "You can't walk in there and take his brother "because the minute you walk out the door, "she can charge you with kidnapping." That's when I said to them, "Then what am I gonna do?" He said, "I'm gonna draw ya up papers, "put my notary seal on it, but you've gotta get "that boy's father to sign the paper." - She'd try to corner ya, and put ya in a situation where you couldn't, where it was like, you know what I mean? She had all the legal stuff behind her. - So when I went in and I told her I was takin' Rob, she said, "You can't take him." I said, "Yes, I can, I have custody of him." 'Cause I would never, we would never sign off custody. And I said, "Well might as well pack up Christopher "'cause he's coming with me," and he said, "No, I'm not lettin' ya take him." And she looked to her second husband, Rick, and said, "You gonna let my parents take him?" And he said, "No." So I thought about it for a few minutes and he wandered away, and of course she's cryin' and carryin' on. She didn't wanna lose one let alone two, and that's when I went downstairs because, Rob's grandfather had already told me what was going on downstairs, so when I went downstairs and I said, "Rick, I'm taking Christopher with me." He said, "You can't take him." I said, "Yes, I can." I said, "I've got papers here for you to sign "so that I can take him." He said, "You're not takin' him," and that's when I got up and I pushed him against the wall and I said, "I either take him or I call the Mounties "and they take you for that stuff "that's growin' in the other room." - Yes, I did have a couple of pot plants growin' in the basement. I was young. - And he couldn't stop me from takin' 'em. Because, I would've called the Mounties. - It was basically she wanted what was right for, what was better for Robby, right? And I wanted what was better for Robby and also for Christopher. - She called us and we had already offered to take Chris if that was the case, which, when we got the word, we did. - And so then it was agreed upon, the way things went. One went one way, the other went the other. Everybody still stayed pretty well in touch. Everybody except one person. - It was great, I thought it was just for a visit. I don't remember who told me, it was probably my mom, that, "Oh no, he's back for good." - I went by the place, stopped in, and talked to them and told them where I was going and I would be back on the Monday, and I would pick up all the toys and stuff the kids had. I had a truck, so I could take it all. I would pick it up and bring it back here. In doing so, I arrived on, I think Monday, I think it was sometime on Monday. I pulled in there and they had a garage sale on the weekend and sold all the stuff. Very nice. So I brought back nothing. - Why would you sell your kids' toys? If you didn't need the money? But, if the kids aren't eating, there's no money. If there's pot being grown in the basement, that's one step to other things, right? - How do you tell a kid that they ain't there no more? - After Chris came to live with us, I took him out for a haircut one day and the barber took a look at the scaling on his head and he says, "He was malnutritioned at one time or another, "and that's why he's got this scabs or scale "on the top of his head." - Yeah, she hurt us a bit, but being parents you learn to forgive and forget, but she hurt her boys. That I don't forgive. - It was definitely a learning experience. This trip has been extremely informative. I literally went from knowing extremely little to knowing like 200 times more than I ever thought I would. And I think we started the actual search. We've stretched our legs into social media a bit and we've got some positive results. We've been in Collingwood, her last known location. I'm excited, I think we've got somewhere to go from here. The biggest thing I've learned is that this is not just a character in a picture, but an actual person. Like, I watched a video and saw life, the person was living and breathing and interacting with people. So yeah, it's a real thing, it's a real person. - There are some things that are just too hard to do by yourself, and I think for both Rob and Chris, they've done too much of this by themselves. I'd like to see that they really think about doing this with someone else, somebody trained and somebody who can really help them to let it go. Hello? Hey, Chris, it's Rob. Hey. Hey, this is being recorded for the sake of the film. Okay. Just thought I'd throw it out there. - Right. - Okay. - Yeah, I mean, it's nice that it is all kinda revolving around the same area. I don't know if there's an address for this 2006 incident that we can investigate, if it's a landlord, what do they know, what can they say, what are they willing to say. It just really points us in another direction. With Chris still in the GTA, the Greater Toronto Area, he might be doing a little road trip himself, I don't know. - Yeah. - Yeah, absolutely, so the plan right now is to focus all our efforts on Toronto, as crazy as that sounds, a city of over two million, three million once you consider the surrounding area, but a new flyer will go up today with Lee Byford and I'll try to get more recent pics to keep pushin'. So, just got a message, man, on Facebook from somebody who saw our social media posts and they said, "This is Lee's number." They gave me the phone number. This was just forwarded to me for some reason. She said, "This is your mom's number," and it's a 647 number, which is a Toronto area code. So, what the hell do I do? - This is someone who was in a certain picture that was just posted. I'm trying to protect their identity a little bit since this is being recorded. - The message says, and I'm not skipping a word, "This is Lee's number," the number, "this was just forwarded to me for some reason." She said, "This is your mom's number." And I responded right away, are you kidding me? Question mark, question mark, question mark, question mark. And I'm waiting for a response. So this was a flyer that was posted on a Collingwood Facebook site, and someone saw it and contacted the person who posted it, who's, again, one of these people in the pictures that we just posted through social media, and now this number is out there. Hello. - Hi, could I speak to Lee Byford please? - Lee, I'm a friend from the Collingwood area, I think we may have worked together. I'm just trying to see if I can get in touch with you. I think we worked together at Kelsey's. - Well... - Oh my god. My connection just dropped. - Well, at first I thought it was a voicemail. Oh my god, and then my connection dropped 'cause I have all my I-devices on. Holy. - All right, I'm gonna call her from the phone. - Yeah, yeah I agree. Jesus. Okay, I'll let you know how it goes. - Hi, Lee? - Hi, sorry, my connection dropped. I was calling you from a Skype number. - Sorry about that. Listen, this is a bit strange. Are you sitting down? - I think you're my mom. - Rob McCallum. - I'm in Las Vegas right now, which if this is a mobile number, that's probably why it came up as a 213 area code. Mm hmm. - Are you my mom? - I don't know if you're gonna hang up or anything but I just wanna let you know I love you. - Yeah. - Or text me and I can call ya back to save long distance. Please call me. - Thank you so much. - I love you. - Just give me a second. It's her. - Chris. - It's Rob. - Are you sitting down? - Please sit down. - I just talked to our mom. I'm not ya. - Here, I gotta race back to my office. Well, I'm hopin' that we can do the first meet together with cameras around, if she's cool with that. - I hear ya, man, I gotta book a whole new flight. - Are you sitting down? - Okay, I need some advice. - I just talked to my mom. - No. You did? - 100%. To leave a callback number, press five. - Hey Uncle Rob, it's your nephew, Rob. It's about 20 to 3:00 your time on Wednesday, November 19th. Just calling to let you know that I talked to my mom. Hopefully you're not on a ladder when you get this. So Jordan and I have had an adventure this morning. - Well, what happened? I talked to my mom on the phone. - No way, are you serious? I talked to her on the phone. - Really? - Wow, when I return to Las Vegas I'll have a mom in my life. Weird. So where are we going? - After 10 days of the social media push and the hunt and papering the town, we got a response and made connections with my mom, and now we're about an hour away from a journey that started, really only like two or three weeks ago and 10 days of hard push to try to find her. From what I understand, it was part in parcel from our push to Collingwood, seeing the flyers all over town, and the stuff on Facebook, and a combination of the two paid off. Good to see ya. - Long time no see. Yeah. What was your reaction when I called you and I said, "I hope you're sitting down, "I just talked to our mom"? It was a holy moment. It was a holy moment. That was, it happened a lot faster than I thought it was gonna happen. - The closest thing is adrenaline, and it's just been like ongoing, like, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. Just like, this is happening, and the second that I got the information and talked to her on the phone, it just didn't end for that entire day, and then the next day it was like, oh, no this is still happening. This wasn't a dream and this wasn't just for a film. This is big ramification kinda stuff. Booked a flight that night and, well, here I am. - I don't have any expectations, I don't think. - All I know is that everybody said that it would be near impossible to do, and we did it. And that feels really good for the moment. She's worried that we won't recognize her, she's worried that she's not gonna have the answers to the questions we have, and I just said, "I'm hungry, I'm just lookin' "for somethin' to eat." She said, "I don't think I'll be able to eat," and I said, "Chris and I probably won't have that problem." I mean, we can eat. So, you hungry? - I could eat. - You could eat. Okay. All right, we're goin' off into the sunset. - It was so, I can't even think of a word to describe what I was feeling because it was somethin' I dreamed about, that I might hear from them someday but I just, certainly didn't wake up that day thinkin' it would be that day. I don't wanna say it was a different time, but it was, and I never thought to go to a relative and tell them what I was going through, 'cause I couldn't believe that I couldn't talk to my parents or that when I did, it wasn't well received. They, you know... I just felt very lost, and that I didn't have anybody. Came back from Winnipeg and moved to Toronto. My biggest goal was to get my children, and for the first four years I lived in Toronto I lived in a room, I didn't have an apartment because then I could save more money, and I saw three different lawyers, I had lawyers telling me, "Oh, you never should've signed that. "Your mother should've known better, "that you were entitled to have your own representation." My mother's words came back to haunt me. She told me, 'cause I told her I was gonna fight. I said, "If I have to go to a lawyer, I will." She goes, "You'll never have enough money "to fight us for custody." And those words have haunted me forever, 'cause I thought, why do they think I'm so bad? Why do they think I don't deserve to be a part of my child's life? I didn't understand, I still don't understand. - I don't, no, I don't, because I mean, we always had, I don't know where that comes from because, I don't. I mean, this is kinda news to me 'cause I don't even recall this at all. Before this conversation, I don't recall that ever being an issue. - Yeah, again, I'm not aware of that at all. I don't recall there not being food in the house. I don't know if this is, I don't know where this is coming from, I don't. I don't recall that at all. I mean, what I recall, there was always the snacks that they liked. I don't... - Now see, again, this is the first, it's nothing he ever discussed with me, that I recall. And I mean, he lived there. So why she would call him at the resort to tell him there was nothing when he lived there. This is pretty confusing for me right now 'cause I don't, I don't remember anything like this. I remember there were issues where Rick and I didn't talk. I don't remember this at all, in this context. I just know there were problems, but I don't remember there not being food in the house. I don't remember. This is a bit of a, I'm trying to go back all that time ago and I don't remember any of this. I don't know if this happened after I left. I don't, I don't. There was just so much that was left unsaid and undone, and our children suffered. I take full responsibility for that. I have, so much guilt, and I don't, and I deserve the guilt. It's not that I, I just didn't have the skills. I didn't know what to do, I didn't know who to ask for help. I didn't. I just didn't know what to do. - So we just finished interviewing my mom. It was like a three hour interview, and I gotta send the footage to Chris 'cause he couldn't be there. We covered a lot of subjects. I'm sure I'm gonna have a ton more questions as I think about how everything went, but the two things that have hit me almost right away is, that I have no idea how the family is going to react, and connected to that, that my actions to go look for her and subsequently find her are gonna have a bigger repercussion than I first thought. This is now going to affect a lot more lives than just my own, and going on this adventure is more than my curiosity or my brother's curiosity at this point. I thought it was a little bit more contained than what it is. I kinda just hope that it has a happy ending for everybody, 'cause I really don't know how everybody else is gonna react now that we know where she is, and if she's gonna be a part of people's lives going forward. It's bigger than just me. - It's really bringing out what's your worst fear, what's the worst thing that can happen if you really, really think about it, talk about it, bring it out into the open and talk to somebody about it. People I've spoken to before, in treatment, have said, "I'm afraid if I start to cry, I won't stop. "I'm afraid if I get angry, I won't be able to stop." So it's that fear of having some emotion that they just are not gonna be able to control or stop. - I was thoroughly convinced that they wouldn't find her. So yeah, I was, I was not only relieved, I was happy that they found her. - And I did tell him, I said, "If you do find her, I'll contribute 200 dollars "to the project, or the film fund." And then he called 10, 11 days later and told me I had to write a check. - I always felt something had happened 'because I thought we would have heard from her, you know, one way or the other. - But it was a relief, in respect, because I had resigned the fact that I may never see her again. - Yeah, also happy to know that he did find her, and one, she was alive. - First I saw her, it was like, dead silence. Just, eye to eye contact, I could see the relief on her face. I didn't wanna put her on the spot, and I didn't wanna go reflective on what had happened in the past. I just basically said to her, "There's a lotta water gone under the bridge. "We can't turn it back, we can only move forward." - We talk about the 24 years that we hadn't seen her, and yes, she's definitely changed, but we've changed. Age does a wonderful thing for you. Everything takes time, and time heals a lot. - You've gotta let a lotta anger and personal stuff go, on the grounds that, they could maintain that anger, my sister could maintain her anger, and we can go another 24 years with no contact again. But I think the first 24 years has shown everybody that we don't want that to happen again. It wasn't worth it, no matter what. - Probably if I'da known she was so close by when the boys were little, I probably would've tried to contact her. - Time does solve a lot of problems, because whatever problems there were in the past, they obviously don't exist at this point. - Yeah, when she came home for Christmas it was a very pleasant occasion. And we spent, well, the best part of Christmas at her brother's, 'cause the whole family was there. - I think one of the better aspects of the getting together at Christmas is simply the fact that we were able to do some family photographs that hadn't been done for 24 years, that's including my granddaughter in there. It was a very happy moment to meet her and see her again. - So we just accomplished being a family again. - I don't feel alone anymore. For me, it's overwhelming 'cause I've never really counted on anybody, and I, it's hard getting used to counting on people or having people there for me. I'm just not used to it, it's a new feeling. I've always thought family was important. It's trying to deal with family issues at certain times and not knowing how. I think if you can overcome that, then, then that's key. - I give her due, I give her all the credit in the world for what she has accomplished. She's done marvelous things with herself, more than I would expect, put it that way, if you wanna put it that way. I would do the same for her as I would do for anybody else in the family. I can support her 100%, without question. I think you can achieve anything you want if you put your mind to it. - If you want it bad enough. - If you want it bad enough. - There is love from your family that members want to share with you, and it's something that can't be done when you're not around. Don't ever sit back and think that you're not loved, you're not wanted, or anything else, because you're wrong, like the 24 years, you're wrong. We do love you and we do want contact. - Well first, congratulations. You've got married today. It's been about a year since we went on that epic road trip where we found our mom. How has that year been and what do you think now that she's in our lives? - I think it's great. She's made, she's almost fully integrated back into her family. She's moved back to London. We talk to her almost every day, well at least, I do. Definitely have good conversations at least once a week. It's not what I expected. - Yeah, it's the Hollywood ending, and because it feels so manufactured, it almost doesn't feel real. But we have this opportunity and I think for everybody watching, I think one of the main things is, this is really just the starting point. You can't just have somebody jump back in your lives and everything is good. The journey is still ahead, so there's still a lot to learn. But what's your big takeaway from this whole experience? - I have my mom back, someone I never had. She wants to be here, she's figuring it out as she goes, just like we are, and it's great. I can't be happier.
