ARIEL DASALAN, FORMER BASKETBALL STAR, TIME'S UP! I need you to do your job, okay? Don't forget about the shipment for tomorrow. Got it? It's my ass that's on the line. Is that clear? Are you listening? You're stupid, aren't you? See, you're not listening. This goddamned life. Here, take it. Go on. Can't even drive. So annoying. Go, turn! Guard him! Guard him! Ref! You're going on eight seconds, not three! Keep track! Jesus! Ref, the heck with your calls! They all favor the other team! You have a warning! You'd better stop me! Stop me! I'm gonna pinch his nipples with a nail clipper. - Bro! Bro! Relax! - What is it? We don't want a technical foul. How could I relax? Look at the score. Stop me. Stop me! Stop eating. Got it? - Watch your diet. - I'm on keto. - Wait. There's the ref. - Hang on. He said time out. Time out. Okay. Guys, here's the plan. Ball movement. Let's talk ball movement. You. Once you're in the backcourt, be aware of the shot clock and spacing, okay? If you are slow, you will be left behind. That's the thing, Coach. I gave her everything, but she still left me. And you... If they leave you, let them go. Stop chasing after them! She was so quick to move on, Coach. She already found someone new. I should start calling you Team Feels. Where the hell is our point guard? He should be carrying the ball. Guys, sorry I'm late. I haven't had proper sleep. I was on duty last night. - You're the point guard? - Yes, sir. An actual guard. - All right, move the ball. - Yes, Coach. Guys, come here. Listen. All those strong feelings, use them! Hear me? Take them out on the court. Passion! Passion! You can do it! Okay? Passion! On three! - Passion! - Passion! Look at the other team's players. Are you gonna lose to a bunch of deadbeats? They're just the bench players, Coach. The starting five will enter. Holy shit. No wonder we're losing. Look at those guys. Have some faith, Coach. You gave a great speech. Passion! - Fight! - Yes! That's the spirit! But there's just three of them. Where's the other two... Coach! Coach! Yes! Yes! Yes! We're done for. We can catch up. No worries. That's okay. I should've just eaten. That's enough. You didn't guard the ball. Dudes. - Thank you. - Coach! Thank you. Thank you, idol. You're so yummy, daddies! Wait for us! Watch those hags go. Hell, what are you grinning for? Because you still got it! What makes you say that? We just lost. I was watching you. While you were coaching, it was so smooth! You're amazing! Oh, shut up. Do I really need another headache? Never mind. I gave up this game a long time ago. It just breaks my heart. Speaking of which, check out this brawl. Watch this. - Is that a sex scandal? - No, no. Look. They're beating each other up. Look, look! It's this damn coach's fault. That bastard Mac Morales. This guy... Ah, jeez! Something's sketchy about this guy whenever I watch his games. Look closely. - Hey! - Hey! - Where are we? - "Where are we?" This is what I'm saying. Move on. You're doing it again. You know what? Life is passing you by. Forget about that Mac Morales. This is your destiny. Bro... I think you're living a better life than him. What the hell do you mean? How is my life better than his? Explain. You have a wife and a kid who loves you. - Ah, yes, that's true. - Right? At work, you're the number one inspector - for the fertilizer company. - Destino. - And most importantly... - There's more? - There's more! - What else? I'm your best friend. I'm so unlucky. - What'd you say? - Nothing. I'm so lucky to have you. My man... even in another lifetime, I'd always be here for you. That's why I love you, man. Then why'd you call me bad luck? Come on, I was kidding. What are you doing? For good luck! Buddha. Come on. Love. - Hi. - You're so early! Wow, so sweet. Annoyingly sweet. Sorry. You guys are so lucky. Where can we find something like that anyway? You know what, stop looking for it - and it'll come on its own. - Right. You never know, it might fall right on your lap tomorrow. If only. I sure hope it does. Because... - Because? - Feeling like a young man, you know. So, where are you off to? If you want, you guys can go ahead. He's being sensitive again. - My man! - Hey, man. You're staring into space again. Damn! Damn! What is it? Hey! You're ready for anything. - Wow! Perfect. - How is it? Is it just me or is she moving in slow motion? - Give it a go. - Let me see. I want the experience. Is it slow motion for you, too? God damn. Beautiful? - Beautiful. - Beautiful? I'm toast. - Beautiful? - I meant you. You're beautiful! I swear, you boys are such dogs. Especially you. I was looking at the pool. I don't know about him. Why me? I was just looking at the mountains by the pool... I mean, the mountains over there. I don't know what's wrong. Isn't this a smart TV? - What's wrong? - Black coffee, no sugar, no milk, boiling hot. My love's got me memorized. - Of course. - Thank you. Come on, work... Oh, I know, I know. Probably... This must be hot. I need to... Ariel... You're outdated. - What do you mean? - Nobody uses that anymore! When will you upgrade? Even your phone is ancient! You can watch it here, Pop. I can watch there, sweetie? For sure. Great. What do you want to watch anyway? The replay of the game earlier. What is up, basketballers? My fellow fans! My, my, my! Team Destino, especially Coach Mac Morales, is no stranger to criticisms from fans of the game. This replay clearly shows that a fight broke out between Team Destino and Team Bulacan. We can see that their star player, Bobby McAnthony Manuel, was involved in the rumble with the other players. This is what the players and coaches are doing... They get paid to rig the results. That's not cool! It tramples on our love for the sport! Coach Mac Morales, if you get caught, I'm sure you won't like - where you end up. - I don't like that. It's all gossip. - No, Pops. - I want to see the actual game. - Look for it. - Let's look for it. There we go. Here we go. Thank you... Ah! Perfect timing. Were you able to settle the bill with Nanding? Not yet. Christ's sake. Where is it? This is the problem. Hey, Ariel! Where's the rent money? - Well, Miss Nanding... - Mr. Nanding! Nanding! That's what I said... I was going to ask for an extension. Your excuses can't pay the bills, Ariel. I've given you so many extensions! - Where's my money? - Don't worry, when I get my pay, I'll wire it directly to you. You'd better! If I don't get it by end of the month, you're moving out! - Understood. - You're a pain in the ass. Let me just check this. Don't touch that! I'm the only one allowed to touch it. But this is our house. I can do it. Watch. I'll kill you, Ariel! Roasted gay. Switch on. Switch on. Darn! When you're down on your luck, right? Ugh! This stupid life. - Love, don't talk like that. - No, it's just that... - It just goes on and on. - We're doing okay. Aren't you happy that we're a complete family? Of course I'm happy. I have you, and our daughter. But... we should have more. It will come. It's just waiting around the corner. We should just be grateful for the things we do have. Grateful to whom? Be thankful for what? Our below-average life? For the opportunities that knock on my door... Sorry. I don't get any of those because they all go to Mac Morales! Love. Love, that's enough. Enough of that talk, okay? What's this? Write down on this notebook everything that's bothering you. When you do that, you'll feel much lighter. Okay? - You're gonna be okay? - Yes. I'm going to sleep. - Good night, love. I love you. - Okay. - Son. - Yes? Let me just get my panties. I'll take a bath. So, that's why it tastes like seawater. Tastes like pu... Good morning, love! Love? Where is she? Sorry, I didn't wake you up. I was needed early at the resort. Don't bother picking me up. I'm working overtime. I think she forgot my birthday. That should do it. Exercise! Hidilyn Diaz! Ow! Ouch. That hurts. Ouch. That cracked. Breakfast is ready! - Good morning, Pop! - Good morning, sweetie! Pop, I need to go. - Huh? - We have to finish something for finals. - Eat first. - I can't! I'm going to be late. - Bye, Pop! - Hey, sweetie! Aren't you forgetting something? - Oh, right! - Thank you! My allowance. Thanks, Pop! Bye! Love you! Love you! Good morning, son! Sorry, you startled me. You really put in some effort. Son, I'm off to Zumba with my girlfriends. - Oh, Zumba. - If you're going out, don't forget to lock the door, okay? And don't lose the keys again! Okay. Mom, will you be back early? No, I'll be out all night, son. Don't wait for me anymore. - All night? - All night Zumba! - All right, Mom. - Bye, son! Unbelievable. I took a day off, but nobody's home anyway. Wasted pay. And I had to see your face. Mac Morales, you bastard. Take this. Give me a break! Dear Charo... I hate my life. Nobody remembered my birthday. I'm so upset. Not a greeting from you either, notebook. Well... the house is rarely this quiet. I will make the most of it. I'll chill for a bit. - Hello? - Where are you? Boss. I'm at home. Who told you that you could skip work? I'm on birthday leave. - According to who? - I informed the HR last week. I don't care about any of that. My father's in town and I need you here. If you're not here in five minutes, you are fired! Coming, sir! Where is he? Look at how far I had to run! Everything should be in order! - Do you understand? - Yes, ma'am! - What was that? - Yes, sir! What are you doing? I said, "Keep going!" He's right! Listen to Boss! - Get to work! - Yes! I'm going! Oh, sorry. Ah! Is that my honey? He's here. - Why is he swerving that way? - Why don't you ask him? - Is he drunk? - How should I know? He's just enjoying his car. Oh, no, here he comes. - Buddy. - Hey, buddy. - They're here. - Who? Mac Morales and the rest of them. Yeah, the other team has arrived here, too. What are they doing here? The management thought of inviting them over. They're moving the championship venue here. What? They're holding the rematch here? That's what I said. That's the reason I called. - Let's talk later. He's here with my boss. - All right. - Okay? - Okay, man. Bye. Just my luck! Oh my God! Boss! Sorry! Let me fix it. Sorry! Ariel! Boss! Help me, Boss! Hey! Wait. I'm not part of this. Get back to fighting. Give it to me. This is probably... the worst... day of my life. What else could go wrong? I was just asking, not wishing. Look at this family, playing in the rain instead of taking cover. You're gonna get sick! What are you doing? They're just enjoying their lives. How long have you been there? A while. I'm Jessie, by the way. Nice to meet you. Ariel. You have an umbrella, why won't you use it? "Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass, it's learning how to dance in the rain." Sounds fancy. Where did you pick that up? From the Internet. Makes sense. It must be tough to catch a ride now, huh? Passengers are hard to come by, too. Passengers? Why, are you a driver? Isn't it obvious? I have a Good Morning Towel. Where's your ride? Over here. Wow! Now, that's a jeep! Come, get in. This jeep goes on forever. Whoa, that was a quick change. Looking good. This is my usual driving uniform. Well, it suits you. You're driving a limo-jeep. You should change your shirt. You're soaked. What color would you like? Orange? Whoa! But my jeans got wet, too. Are you a Boy Scout? - Boss, drop me off at... - Barangay Pag-asa? How did you know? But hey, thanks, mister. You showed up just in time. Holy crap. You're a driver and a barista? Do you work here, too? Stop asking so many questions! The important thing is, we found a shelter from the worries that rain on us. Let's wait for it to subside, then we're good to go. I think it's gonna take a while. Then let's make the most of what's in front of us. You're always looking elsewhere. Have some coffee while waiting. - Okay, a cup of... - Black coffee, no sugar, no milk, scalding hot. That's exactly right! How did you guess that right? No, that's all I have here. That was a complicated ritual. I'd have been fine with instant coffee. That tastes better. It was prepared with care. Drink. Oh, it's good! Very good! Aren't you Mac Morales' rival back in high school? The championship, correct? For Christ's sake. Of all the strangers I could bump into, it had to be one who saw that game. I just want to know, do you think your life would have been better if you were able to shoot that last basket? Well, better, by far! I'd have a whole different life. That was my game-winning shot. That would have been my moment. You know what, I have the perfect recipe for you. Wait. That might keep me wide awake in the middle of the night. But that's what you need, a rude awakening. This is wild! I really wish that's what happened. Sit down. - You're always in a hurry. - You put something in my drink. - Let me explain something... - Get away from me! Don't touch... Stay away from me. - I wasn't going near you. - Don't come near... You put something here. - There's just... - You put something in here. I did put something. Thank God, it was just a dream. I thought I got scammed. Hon? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Miss Lauren! - Ouch. What happened? What is this? Hon, what's the matter? It's so early, but you're having a nightmare. But the pillow... The pillows... So many pillows! Do you want me to... - Huh? - ...put that to sleep, too? - Which one? - Little John's up, too. No! No! Wh... Why? Hon! What happened to you? Hon! Oh, no! Coach Ariel Dasalan. This is all mine? This was all just a dream to me. Now it's all mine. It's all mine! I can't believe that this ball is floating... You! You bastard. This is all your doing. You brought me here. Where am I? What happened to me? You're asking where you are? No, this can't be! It's not right. I'm confused... Impossible! This can't be happening. In life, nothing is impossible. Listen to this. What's that? TV. Watch. You're missing something. Draw a switch. Right? There. Press it. There we go. I can't hear anything. - Let's turn up the volume. - Wait, what's going on here? - Beating up each other... - There. Damn, partner. What's wrong with Destino? Their chemistry's off. I haven't seen things like this happen. Something's weird. Besides being fishy, is this a chemistry issue? They don't seem to be in sync. I think a part of it is team chemistry, Migs, but a big part of it is Coach Ariel Dasalan. I don't know what he's doing there. Like there's something off, and I noticed something, Coach. The top scorer is taken out of the game during crucial moments. What else? - This will get me in trouble. - You're fine. We can discuss it as long as we stick to the facts. What's your analysis? Some of them want to win, while the others don't. All right. You know me, I'm a straight shooter. I might put Coach Ariel Dasalan on the spot, but I think I'm seeing something weird about the plays, Migs. What's "weird?" - Pretty sure someone's getting paid. - The game's being rigged. - I don't want to accuse. - We don't. Innocent until proven guilty. Unfortunately, it's happening, and it doesn't look good. I hope Coach Ariel is listening to us, since it's probably not true, but it's not so good. This is not good. This can't be. What should I do? What should I do? This can't... How should I know? This is your life. I can't help you. - You're the one... - Honey, it's time for our morning swim! Give me a minute. I'm a little busy. I can't! I don't want to. Honey! Come here! - Go to her. - I don't want to. Honey, pick out something for me. - Help her with it. - I don't want. No. - Help me pick out a bikini. - Coming! I'm going for a swim. - Hon? - What? I'm going for a swim. I think this looks good on me. I think so. What are you doing? - I don't want to look. - Just look. - I don't want to. That's wrong. - That's your problem. It's right in front of you, but you're still looking for someone else. I know she's gorgeous, but she's not... You don't understand. Maybe you don't have a family. When you're a married man, even if... I'm getting dizzy. What happened to you, Dad? You're acting like Stranger Things. What happened to you? You look like Money Heist. Let's eat, Father. Okay, daughter. What a grouch. Just my luck, to have a kid like her in this life. Just eat. Where are you going, Father? I will just... You just... Eat yourself. The heck? You changed pretty fast. So did you. Huh? Hold on to this, okay? You'll have use for it. Where are you taking me? You know what, just bring me to Jennifer. I want to see her. Okay, sure. Jennifer! Jennifer, my love. I thought I'd never find you again. Why can't I wrap my arms around you? Have you been working out? But it's okay. Let me hug you, Jennifer. You smell like fish paste. But I don't mind, because I love you. My Jennifer! Lucifer! Jessie, I can't find Jennifer. The receptionist gave me a BJ. It was so good! - Did she give you one, too? - What BJ? Buko juice. - What did you think it was? - I wasn't thinking anything. Ariel! - I've been looking for you! - Boss Leeroy, Boss Terry. Boss Leeroy, I'm sorry about what happened. It won't happen again. Boss Terry, I assure you, the shipments will arrive on time. It was a coordination issue, but it's all good now. Happy birthday, Ariel! Happy birthday. Dad. Dad, excuse me. I was trying to call you for a meeting we had to attend, but you were nowhere to be found. I was busy. You can't be busy with other things, Ariel. This is more important! I mean... Because, Ariel... we have to focus on work. This is important. Right, buddy? Right, Daddy... I mean, Pops? Am I right? That's how we do it. Focused. Come out already. - What was that? - Nothing. Ah, by the way, I'd like to introduce you to... to Coconut Juice. My friend. - Are you okay, Coach? - Actually, no. Ah, sir, there's just a... - What's up with him? - I'm not sure, Dad. Are you sure? - Come on! - Take that spot! One! Pick up the pace! Just a sec! Coach Ariel is here! Coach is here. Over here, Coach! Run! Run! Defense! Coach Ariel! Coach Ariel, get out of the way. You'll get hit! We don't want that on your birthday. Come over here, Coach Happy birthday! Happy birthday! You're gonna get hurt. What were you doing? Be careful on your birthday. You're too excited, Coach. Coach, our players are in top form, and they're ready for the upcoming games. - Good. Good. - They trained really hard. Look at Bobby. Watch what he does. He's really good. See that? - Right, Coach? - He sure is! Move! Move! Get out of my way! - Open! Open! - Move! Move! Pass the ball! Over here! Not there! Get out of the way! Why didn't he pass? They were open! Coach, he will never pass the ball because options one-to-five are all for Bobby. He's the star player. He has five defenders! Can he handle that? Coach, you've got to trust Bobby. He has defeated the very best. He's quick, like the Flash. How do you like that? Wait. Why always him? Where's the rest of the team? That's them right there. Cheers! Cheers! - So chill. - Yes, Coach. I want to slap them silly! Good work. Look, their plays are airtight. They're ready for the championship. Coach, can we talk in private? Sure. By the way, Coach Ariel, have you talked to Leeroy? He's been looking for you. Yes, I have. Good. We should just stick to the game plan. We ran into a problem in the last game, but you've got nothing to worry about. I've spoken with Bobby. All is ironed out. No problem at all. Nothing will go wrong. Coach, what do you want to do next? What drills would you like us to do? Hi! I just need to talk to someone. Coach! Has a nice ring to it. Coach Ariel. Can you leave me alone, Jessie? Please, take me back to my family. You haven't even told me how this happened. You see, Coach... every event in our lives has an effect on our physical and social environment. Take a look at this. Hang on. There. When I drop this... you'll see... how it affects everything around it. You see? In your case... And because of that win, your life took a different turn. You became a basketball superstar. You got married to Lauren. You became wealthy and so much more. Right? I can't do this. I can't. There you go again. You never believe in yourself. You've been complaining about this all your life. Now it's here. Are you trying to say, "Be careful what you wish for?" I should have just said that, huh? By the way... What's this? Life is like a rock. It's hard. Coach! Mac. You have a visitor. Who is it? Boss. Are we all set for the game this weekend? Yes, all set. Everything's good to go. Isn't that right, Coach? What the hell are you talking about? - The game this weekend. - Who is this? There's another one. He wants to see all the plays for Game 7. Game 7 plays now! - What are you standing around for? - On it! You slowpokes! If I say now, I mean now! What's he saying? He said okay. We're okay. Ah, okay. What's okay? No matter what, stick to the plan. Okay? Okay. Here. You're also getting a cut as assistant coach. I will also give it to you. Sit tight. Bud, why are we... What are you thinking? Jessie... what do I do with this? You could do the things you've never done before. I guess. - I hit the jackpot, huh? - Yeah. But... I can't seem to enjoy it without my loved ones. All right, here's what we'll do. Let's play a game. If I lose... I'll bring you to your old family. - Really? - Yeah. Deal. - What do we play? - Boxing. What? Oh, I know. Shooting. First one to miss a shot loses. - You're in? - I'm game. You'll take me to my family, okay? Go ahead. Go first. Okay. Sorry, I haven't had practice. Let's try another. Change it up! I already did that one and this. Hurry up! I missed! Missed! - Jessie! Jessie! - I freaking missed. What? I think he's dead. You want to see your family? - Yes. - Then come on. Move it! Quickly! Ariel. Jennifer. Jennifer. Jennifer. Jennifer, who's at the door? Ariel Dasalan? Rocky? It's you! Coach! How are you? Idol! We haven't seen each other in so long, buddy! Yeah. - How did you find our house? - Their house. Your house, of course. My... My driver knows his way around. You look tired, Coach. You should come in. - Okay. - How about it? - I'll fix you something. - All right. Good luck with your championship game. How long will you be staying here in La Union? Probably only until after the game. Who would have thought the championship would be held here? Did you know we're huge fans of Destino? "We?" Don't include me. You're all he ever talks about. And can you believe it, he loves watching your games so much, we had to postpone our wedding. Wedding? Twenty years! - Twenty years? - Yeah. Congrats. Thanks, buddy. Ariel, are you okay? Yeah. Wait, I'll get you something to drink. Hey, bud, I really appreciate this. I thought you'd forgotten all about me. - Thanks for coming to see me. - You got it, bud. How could I forget you? I remember... when we were kids... you loved imitating action stars. - You still remember? - That's your dream! Of course. - Let's see if you know who these are. - Go, shoot. Who's this? - Fernando Poe, Jr. - Good. How about this? - Lito Lapid. - You're good! How about this? Let's see. Hey! Hold on. Did any of them do that? - Yeah! - Who? Dolphy. He's not an action star. Yeah, but... honestly, I'm happy... that you and Jennifer ended up together. Thanks, bud. It's our anniversary today, you know. Wow! - It's their anniversary. - This morning, we got up to five rounds. Damn. Hey! - What are you telling him? - Nothing! I swear. What's wrong with a little guy talk? We're just reminiscing. Your... your love story... How did it... - Who... - This is what happened. Where's Ariel? Not here. He left. His team won. I'll stay with you. You tell the story. You see, bud, back then, I was searching for a girlfriend. The advice I got from Babycake was... Sweetheart, stop it! She said... "I shouldn't go looking for love, because it's going to find its way to me." I found him alone when you weren't there. That's where it started. I see. I think I might be intruding. I'll go ahead. We still have practice. Thanks for the snacks. Ah, bud... thanks again. And... good luck. I hope you win the cup. Thanks. Thanks for dropping by, bud. Can I get a hug, Coach? Sure thing, bud. I've missed you. I missed you, too, bud. I'm so glad you dropped by. I'll never forget this. All right, happy anniversary. - Thank you. - Thanks, bud. Bud. Hey, what's that? Can I see? You're nervous about your game, huh? No. I'm writing something for her. "Jennifer... would you believe me if I told you... if I told you that... you and I ended up together... in my other life?" Jessie... I don't know what to do now. Ariel... we do good not for ourselves... but for the universe. Because it starts with U-N-I. Do you get what I'm saying? Damn you, you're ruining the moment! You're so corny! You're like my mother! My mom. We need to go see her. Let's go! Son, I saw your last game. You got into this huge mess. Son, be honest with me. Are you rigging the game? Ma, I don't know what I got myself into. Wait, how did you know? Well... I told her, Coach. Good Lord. Mark Joseph rose from the dead. I thought we were keeping this on the down low. We're being discreet, remember? - I swear, you're a troublemaker. - Oh, no... Ah! What's this thing poking me? Hey! What's that? Christ's sake, Bobby. Does it have to be my mother? Oops. As to why he's here, it's because of all those shady things you're doing with the team. Coach, we want to win. Things got messed up because we didn't want to lose. Now, we can't do that if you're not on our side. You couldn't shoot in court, so you're shooting here. Watch your mouth, Ariel. You! I didn't raise you to be the guy to get bribed, who gets paid to rig games! It wasn't me... Ma, I don't know how to fix all of this. That's easy, son. Just do the right thing. And if something's weighing on your mind, you can rest here, okay? Thanks, Ma. Me and my choco pudding - are going to do some hanky-panky. - Yes! Let's go. Wow. See? You're so good! When the scouts see me, I'll go to the pro leagues. And when I get rich, Ma, I'll buy you a house. And we'll live a comfortable life. Shoot the ball! Shoot the ball! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm going! I'm going! Ariel! Ariel! Hey! I've been waiting out here all day! It's so hot! I need to tell you something. Pull the windows down. My God, what's going on with you, Ariel? We've been... waiting... - since... - Just a little more. - Okay, go. - What's going on, Ariel? Are you okay? Are you going through something? Leeroy, even if I try to explain it to you, you'll never understand. I won't... You can't tell me that. I've already done that these past few days. Jer and Jel are wondering what's going through your head. I don't care about Jack and Jill. - Jer and Jel. - Same thing. Whatever! I'm telling you, we should stick to the plan, Ariel. Leeroy, if this is about the championship, just talk to Mac Morales. I'm out. Ariel, these people are dangerous. We can't screw them over. You think you can screw us over? We've placed our bet on the other team. If you don't do what we agreed on, they'll kill you! - What happened to you? - You're a tough guy, huh? You're driving me insane! You can actually get out of that car so we can discuss this. I've been standing here all day! Ow! My finger! I just want you to know... First of all... I don't care about whatever they have agreed upon. Second... I don't care about any of those people. And third... I don't care... about any bastard who wants our team to lose! Got it? - Yes, Coach! - Yes, Coach! I have a question to you. - Amen! - Amen! Go! Second group. Shoot! - Yes! - Yes! No rain, no storm, no flood will stop us! We'll keep fighting! Hey, Coach! You animals! I have a bad feeling. Hey! Why do they look like they wanna win? I don't know. I don't know anything! What do you say, boss? Should I go after them? Wait. Yes! Go get them before somebody else does! - Okay, let's go. - Hey! What are you going to do? I have no idea what they're up to! Hey! What are you going to do? Guys, I'm really sorry. I want you to believe in yourself. - Destino! - Destino! Hold tight! Thank you! Jennifer... I still love you very much. I know you understand. I miss you and our daughter very much. Hey. What are you doing here again? I'm just here to remind you. This is your real life now. Whatever you're planning, it would be best not to go through with it. This is all your fault in the first place! Ever since I got on your jeep, my life has gotten even worse! You wanted all of this! All right. To set things straight, I'll break it to you slowly. Leave me alone. Don't ever come back. I don't need you anymore. And I can do this by myself. Clear? Jessie. Jennifer... I'm coming for you. Get out of there! You think you can just bail? Boss, we can't trust him. Let's take him. Be quiet. Let's postpone our dinner. Something's happening outside. There's a commotion. Huh? Still good, boss? Why don't you help me? Open the door. It's open, boss. Open the door! I'm looking after you. You might be kidnapped because you're stupid! - Stay here. - Don't go out there. - I need to see. - What if something happens to you? Nothing's going to happen. Stay here and be safe! Get back in there! Help! Help! Let me go! Go inside! Hey! - What are you doing? - Be quiet. They might see you. It's Ariel. He's being kidnapped! What? Ariel's being kidnapped? Stop fighting! Get in! You next. - Stay put. - Tart, don't go. - Why not? - Because you might get in trouble. This is my chance. Stop that. Stop that. Get in. Let's follow them. Let's go! Let's go! Here it comes! Here it is! I know it's around here somewhere. Wait. I can't find the alley. I think it's on the right. You're wrong. Go straight. No, it's here on the right. I'm telling you! You're wrong. Take a U-turn. You're right. I missed this turn. I'll go straight. I missed this turn. This is the right one. We're almost there, boss. I told you! You dimwit! You monsters. Where am I? I told you. You can't let Team Destino win. You bailed out! I'll leave you to it. Yes, boss. I already told you. You wouldn't listen. - We already placed... - Can you stay here? - ...our bets... - I'm coming, okay? - It's too late. - Dangerous. - Let's go. - Just follow me, okay? Hey, that's your problem! I can hear voices over there. Why don't you just bet on Destino? So we can be done with this. - Huh, he's right. - We could do that. No, wait. The pot money's bigger if we bet on the other team. Besides, don't pretend you're innocent. You bet against your own team, too, didn't you? And now you're going to change your mind? Hold on to this so you can protect yourself. If you see anyone, hit them. How could you do this to us? Huh? How? Get a hold of yourself. What I mean is... He's going to pay for what he's done. Right? That's it. If I don't, what are you going to do to me? - Boss, want me to kill him? - Yeah, you should! Yeah, yeah! And for that, let me have a go. - Meanie. - You rascal. - Ouch! - How dare you! Shit, boss! Sorry, boss! There, you see? There's Ariel. Sorry, boss. Enough! You're just messing it up! You can't do your jobs right! Yeah, listen to him! How did that happen? - Tie his hand! - I'll tighten it back. How'd you do that? - Let's just go. - Come on! Just leave! We'll handle this. Ariel! Ariel! Ariel! - Rocky! - Arie... Rocky! Take that! You think you're tough? Bud! Tart! You had it coming! Don't back down! Baby, that's a strike! - You think you're tough? - Hang in there. Untie me so I can help him! There. Let's go! That's what you get! Take that! - What are we going to do? - Bud, this is your chance to be an action star. FPJ! Go, Tart! Lito Lapid! Go, Tart! Go, Tart! Go, Tart! I'm tired. Robin Padilla! He's a senator now. Basketball? Abueva! Go, bud! Go, Tart! I just angered him even more. Is there anyone else? Time to let out our secret weapon. Secret weapon? - Dolphy. - You're right! Go, Tart! You can do it, Tart! That's it! I got him! But I'm almost at my limit, bud! Anybody else? Hit him with this! Go for it! How do you like that? You're no match for us! We're awesome! Come here, babe. Sorry. It's just you two. You bastards! You ruined my plans! - No. - Bud! You won't fool me! Hey! No! Bud! Ariel? Ariel? Ariel, wake up! - Ariel! - Hey. Write down everything that's on your mind. I promise you'll feel much lighter. You'll thank me one day. How are you feeling? I think I'm okay. I've read it. Bud... I think... you two should talk. I'll be over there. Is it true? Everything that's written here? I've been dying to tell both of you. Since the moment I saw you two together, I've wanted to tell you how this happened... How this happened to me, but... I saw... I saw how happy you two were. I didn't want to get in the way of that. From what I've read, your life seemed okay. You had a complete family. If it was that perfect... why did you want things to change? Sorry. Good luck with the game, Coach. Good luck. I hope they win. Ah, shit. That's my team. I'm the coach. Sorry, I have to go. Ouch. Bud, let me drive you. Let's go. Did you have a change of clothes? Yes. Why? You don't look like a coach. - What do I look like? - A homeless person. Whatever. Jennifer. Careful, we might crash! You really are an action star. Well, we're here. Buddy... I'm sorry about that. I put your lives in danger. Don't worry, bud. I'm happy we got you out of there. Remember this, buddy... Across all lifetimes... I'll always be here for you. I think I've heard that before. Handshake? Welcome to the National Basketball League finals, the home of the true homegrown. I am your commentator, Ruben Tirado, and joining us tonight is our analyst... None other than Papa Bear. What's your analysis on this battle so far? I think this game will be exciting because of the match up between these two teams! And here is Coach Ariel Dasalan, looking at the fans who have come to support Team Destino. Here we see the close friendship between these two coaches of Team Destino. The championship is about to start. Here comes Commissioner Edward Aquino. You know, Papa Bear, Commissioner had been a long-running basketball referee himself, and because of his vast experience, I'm sure this game will be in expert hands. And now, Sir Raymond Aquino is speaking with the two coaches who will be going head to head in this game. I know this won't be easy. I'm hearing a lot of bad things going around about me, about all of us. We have no control over how things will turn out. But we can put our faith in our hard work, perseverance, all the blood and sweat we poured to get to this point! And for those who want us to lose... - Amen! - Amen! Looks like someone threw a punch, Papa Bear. - What do you think? - Probably nothing. I'm pretty sure it was just their usual way of greeting each other. Here we go. This is it. Here's the jump ball, and the possession goes to Bulacan! Gab Lagman has the ball, asking for an isolation play. Lagman has the ball. Trying to get it off his hands. Lorenzo... passes the ball to Lagman! And it's in! First points for Bulacan. Destino has the ball. Now Francisco has it, passes the ball to Silverio. They're setting up the play. Gives it to Manuel. Manuel fakes a shot. Shoots for three points! He fails. Rebound for Bulacan. And now Bulacan is running. So far, Papa Bear, Bulacan Republicans continue to dominate the game, thanks to Gab Lagman! Gab Lagman! Slam dunk! Here we go. Coach Ariel Dasalan calls for a time-out. His team just couldn't stop Gab Lagman. Team Destino can't get a single point in, and things are going the wrong way for Team Destino. It doesn't look like they're hustling hard enough. Their plays are uninspired. Gab is outplaying all of you, single-handedly! Where's our communication? You're not talking to each other. Destino! Destino! Bobby Manuel was given a pick-and-roll, then scores with a layup. Bobby Manuel! We're at halftime, Papa Bear. What do you think happened during the first half? Republicans taking the lead, but Team Destino caught up pretty quickly. I don't care if you missed a shot, All right, let's do this! Come on! All right. Let's go. The point guard calls a play for Lagman. He goes through the defense and scores! We're out of time-outs. Okay? No more fouls from any of you. Set Bobby up real tight. If you see an opening, make your move. All right? That's right. Coach is right. This is the right time to prove yourselves. We have eight seconds remaining. Let's show them our teamwork, our unity. Make it possible to pass the ball to Bobby. Amen. It's Amen. - Amen! - Amen! Destino ball. He won't make the shot! Don't worry, he won't make it! You won't make it! How was your journey? I learned a lot of things. I'm proud that I led my team to victory despite the obstacles. I'm happy that all my dreams came true. But... there's always... something missing. So, where should I take you? You know where. Hey! Hey! Wait a minute. Which universe are you taking me? Ariel! Don't think I've forgotten about all the money you owe me! I go to your house every single day. I keep looking for you. Where were you? When will you pay? You're a pain in the ass. No! Talk to the police. - Move it! - I'm coming. Wait, hang on. - Take it easy. - You're driving me crazy. Just talk to the police. You're really testing my patience. It's the same excuse every month. Surprise! Surprise, Pop! - Oh, wow! - Happy birthday! Love! I missed you so much. I missed you. - My darling girl. - Pop! - Happy birthday, Pop. - I missed you, too, Ma. I love you. Ma, did you shower at least? You really surprised me. You didn't have to. It really wasn't necessary. Surprise! Buddy! Happy birthday! There's cake! Buddy, I missed you! We just hung out yesterday! Really? Wait, love, what happened to you? What's the matter, son? Oh, nothing. I'm just happy because we're together. Nanding. What about the rent money? - It's been paid. - Huh? Who paid? - Ariel. - Lord? Lord, is that you? - Boss. - Happy birthday. Thank you, Ma'am Lauren. I finally caught on to the antics of Coach Mac and my son. That's okay, Dad. Consider it a blessing in the sky, right? Thank you, Ma'am Lauren. Thank you. You're so yummy. Hey, bud, time to blow your cake. Here you go. Do I have to make a wish? Make a wish before you blow it. Wish! Make a wish. Do I really have to? - Wish! Wish! - Make a wish. Make a wish, bud. Go ahead! No need. I'm all good. You're pretty impressive. Thanks. How do you do it? Why not? Because I only have one arm? Because I'm missing something? The only person holding yourself back is you. We're always looking for what we don't have... that we forget to see the value in the things we already have. Take me, for example. I could spend my whole life feeling sorry for myself, but instead, I choose to be happy. Here. - Love! - Hammer! Buddy, are you okay? I'm okay, buddy. Don't mind me. This is your moment. Ouch! It hurts! My leg! Hidilyn Diaz! Ow. That broke something. It popped! More like Ogie Diaz. What's that smell? It's done. It has been shaken. No, I can't. It's wrong... - Good, huh? - Yeah. No! It's wrong! It's still wrong. - So we were just wobbling earlier? - Yeah. Let's go find her! Jennifer, give me a hug. You smell like fish paste. But I don't mind because I love you. Lucifer! Want a massage? Or... I could get your number. Want me to beat you up? Sure. How? Sweep to the side like that? - Yes! - Like that? You two look like Viva Hot Babes. Mom's The Walking Dead. Here it is. See? They're beating each other up. Cut. Let's cut. Just bad luck. Don't think like that. Everything's gonna be fine. I hope so. Just have faith. Are you open minded? What the hell are you saying? Crazy dude! No, no! Just listen to me. Wait. - Come here. - Stay away. You will be famous. You're... you're a great player, you have a great body. Hey. Hey. This idiot. I said you're gonna be famous. Just like me, right?
