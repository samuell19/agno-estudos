Look, 300-400 meters from the shore... We made it! Look at the bottom! Go over there! Over there, go over there! Let's go! Have to run because otherwise they'll catch us. There are many boats there... Many boats. There are many boats out there on the shore. Hey, amazing engine! We are in Miami! Amazing engine! A 104-mm. FIAT-IVECO. Hey, there's no time for this! We have reached the mainland! OPTION ZERO day 1 - 28 dec 16 Fellow countrymen! As we complete this inspection of the troops and popular parade we commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the heroic uprising of Santiago de Cuba, the landing of the expeditionaries of the Granma Yacht, and the day of the Revolutionary Armed Forces. Events of enormous importance for the life of the country. An occasion in which we pay tribute to the historical leader of the Revolution, Commander in chief Fidel Castro Ruz on the 58th Anniversary of the Triumph of the Revolution which is dedicated to the Cuban youth. At this time... we are delivering the keynote speech which will approximately take 12 minutes. Hello Marcel, I leave you this message for when you get internet service. Tomorrow they'll tell me when I have to pick up the travel document to give myself up in Laredo. May God allow it to be quick. This place is called Tapachula and it's very close to the border, do you know anyone here? We are really in need of help. It's already been one year and four months since we began our journey. We are pushing the limit. The speech has concluded! To hell, man! When you return to Panama say hello to the Deacon. If he asks, don't give him many details. The truth is that I don't have good memories from that place but that doesn't matter now. How ironic, to think you had a visa to go anywhere... and look where you are now. PASTORAL SOCIAL CÁRITAS HEAD OFFICE Why do you take the risk? Don't you see this kind of yellowish? No, that is very white. -Yes? But you're going to make a movie as a documentary? You are going to make several... I know what you want to do. You are going to do like I have seen in Cuban documentaries... where they show the experiences of each person? -Exactly. But for a regular movie you know what would be nice? -What? Because what you're going to do is a documentary, which is different. Look... You should have done... Because there are a lot of people here who filmed their journey, through different places... If you want to dry your clothes there? Yes! I have to rinse them first, wait. With all of those recordings, you should have done, from the beginning... from a starting point... a real story. Up until the moment when we got here. But that is possible... -You can do it like this... Here we are in Panama sheltered by the Caritas association. Everyone you see here, arrived from Turbo, Colombia. We are in a shelter, taken in by these good people... They have given us shelter here. Because many of us were in danger of being deported to Cuba... or left homeless on the streets. Here is a boy who along the way hit... his knee, and he is almost crippled and cannot walk. Here is another boy that because of the sunburn... from when he was on the boat... He has burns on his legs... that cause him severe pain. We are here thanks to the kindness of these people... -We are very grateful... We are all very grateful for the help they have given us. And I hope the government will make some kind of decision about us, that will be in our favor. This is in Brazil. These are... the buses. The buses reach the rivers, because I crossed Brazil by bus, they reach the rivers and then board the barges. They cross the river and then continue their journey. This was from Guyana... from Guyana to Brazil: It's a section of the river that has to be crossed. From Guyana to Brazil you travel on those buses there. They take you there, cross over and continue on. All of those buses... Were full of Cubans. Plus, others that are not in the photo. Like I said, these photos are not in order but I'll explain it to you. This is in the Indians' village. These are the tents in which we would sleep. And after two or three days, when they reach a decision, they let you go on in the canoes that I showed you before. Look at the houses there. Those are the Indians' houses. This site is called Bajo Chiquito. The Indians' houses and were we slept at night. -How long have you been here? I arrived in Caritas on December 21 and I couldn't go on because... The police... The Ecuadorian police caught us and took all our money. Between Ecuador and Colombia they took all our money to let us continue, because if they didn't, they had to deport you. This is the other video which shows the first day... when we are starting to go up the hill, we had not yet entered the jungle, as such. -Hey, people! Say hello to the camera! And there you can see in the background the amount of people there. I zoomed in. From that point on they are all Cuban. Say hello to the camera. Hello to the camera. Crossing the border. My love, say: Hello! You are covered in mud. Look at her... Someone jinxed you... Let it not be said... Laugh at Yadira... Look at that! Let me put the phone away, I can't walk like this. Take it, close it... Man, I was so thirsty... I couldn't even see. Run over here, run over there... We have walked about 20 km, I'm exhausted. Show it, so no one can say we're making it up. Go, reporter! Go, you’re almost there. A bit more... Stop for a second. Stop for a second, guys. I didn’t know it was so much... Oh my God, I can’t believe you. I think these people scammed us. Isn’t it through the other side? Hey, I told you... Coming from the left, all the way there. Oh, my God. Let's go, Cuba! Let's go! Let's go! -I'm showing… How many people are watching? -74. Tell him to give us a like, a lot of likes. Support, strength for us. Give me the backpack... I'll go on filming until we lose the connection We are in the hills. Here in the Colombian jungle of El Darién. 85, guys! Boy, do me a favor, you'll roll down the mountain... Thanks, Carmen. Zenaida, thanks. To everyone, thanks. And share, share... We are in Capurganá. We are on our way to Panama. We are around 300 Cubans. No one will stop us. Share, share! -117 already? 122 people watching... Everyone watching this. Look... Hey, for the Cubans who are watching this: Here we have Firulai... Firulai is walking with us! Firulai is walking with us! People, share this! Hey, raise your hand, raise your hand! Firulai is here with us! Go, Froilán. -Hello to you. -Good luck. -Thanks, brother. May you have faith and prosperity. -Where are you calling me from? -From Spain. -Let’s see, we hope so. -Oh, from Spain. -I lived in Cuba. -In Pinar del Río. -Oh, OK. We’re going directly to Panama, to see what happens. If they give us shelter, if they let us in, let’s see what happens. -Asking for political asylum, I think you won’t have any problems. -Panama is providing refuge. There are many people here who have been turned back three times. They’ve been robbed. They have done everything to them. Women have been raped, men… They have stolen their phones… Everything has happened... -I have a cousin who was deported to Cuba from Panama. -I have some friends that were in Panama two days ago, and they say that… There are people asking to be deported and they’re been sent to Colombia again. -That happened to my cousin, But he was dumb enough to go to Cuba. -Oh, OK. Look, I almost fell. Relax, you won't go through the ground. Does it hurt? See, you can’t even film here. Right. And look... From side to side... There’s a precipice that if you fall in, no one can save you. Look... Show them how deep, so, they can see that if someone falls in no one can save them. That’s for sure. A stick will pierce your head or something else. Well, look at the clouds... That mist you see are clouds. Yes. -We are as high as the clouds. This video is for all the Cubans... who want to get to the United States through the Panamanian jungle. This is a dead man in the middle of the path. The animals ate him. This is so they don't even go for it. Send this... Share it. For all the Cubans who are in Cuba or in other countries. So, they won't even try it. This is death right here. Now you know. Almost there... This hill is very steep. These people are coming up... Well, we will go on... We will keep going... We are going forward... I'm falling... Come on, we're almost there. I'll rest when I get up there... Come on, come on, come on! On fire... I'm tired, tired... Well, I'm hanging up. See you in another... Careful... Go, go... Smile for the camera, baby… This little girl is a warrior... This one is going to the United States! Here we are supporting the mother and the father. Is it still a long way off? This is crazy. We found a caravan in the middle of our journey. The first time I crossed El Darien I thought I wouldn't ever do it again but we had no other option. The only instruction was to follow the river. Most of us were Cuban but I also saw Africans and Haitians. -What are you laughing so much about? the coyote asked. -Follow the river and don't talk so much. Say hello to the camera! Well, people, this is our second day here in the jungle. -The third! The third day already... We have no more food left. Look at the food here. Look, we just fished. Preparing the fish. Look, how delicious. Then you rinse them. Look how delicious. And we cut off the head to make the soup. Did you see that? -No, don't cut off the head. We are not going to cut off the head. I said that for the video... Give it a like! Give it a like! Give it a like, share! Give it a like! Say hello to the camera... He has no strength left to wave at the camera. Look... Say hello, this is for Facebook. And you still want to take selfies, my love. Freddy is packing all the documents, so, they don't get wet... because we are going downstream. So, we have walked about... How many kilometers already? We have been on our way for three days. We have run out of food. And hopefully God will help us... to find our... To find our way soon. We are bruised, muddied, exhausted, But we will get there. This is a video so that five to six years from now we don't forget this shit we're doing now. It has been crazy, but we will make it. Because the bastard that brought us here abandoned us... after we paid him 700 dollars. But, well... There's four of us and we are strong, and we will go on. That's the last of the food. That has rice, sugar, bread; It has everything. Luckily, we have a good source of water. Everything around here is mountain, mountain, and more mountain. And we have passed through some creeks that... God really is with us. We hope that 24 hours from now we'll be laughing at this video. There are around 200 Cubans who are now stranded here in Panama, since President Barack Obama ended the so-called: "Dry Feet, Wet Feet" policy. The prospects for Cubans arriving in the United States are no longer so promising. The policy allowed that Cuban immigrants arriving in U.S. territory without a visa, could normalize their situation and become permanent residents, but they could now face arrests and deportations. And Donald Trump's tough immigration policy could possibly aggravate the conditions for those who flee the island. For many the risk is too big. day 5 - 16 apr 17 Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, Amen. May the Lord be with you. The blessing of the Almighty God, Father, Son and the Holy Spirit… -Amen. ...always accompany you. And that the Mother, Our Lady of Charity, accompany you on your journey. Amen. Bye. -Hello, how are you? No, it's not good. Everything is for there... for Chiriquí... The basket of all baskets. But hey, I'm trying to see what I can do and if I can stay here, because here is where there's a place for me. Yes, Marcel... The problem is that they want to take us to a camp in Chiriquí. And it's a camp for migrants, let's start there. And everyone here is turned upside down because once they send us to a military camp you know that means deportation. No matter how many negotiations and dialogues there are. Everyone here is feeling down in the dumps. And what we know is that we are being moved on Tuesday to the middle of the jungle. They're saying there won't be any deportations, but... What are we going to do? Look, my own son, he's there, his medical appointments... his medication... What do I do? Lunch! These 14 people who were deported today Cuba has already confirmed they are on the island. Give me a cigarette, Alejandro. Play, play. Beware of Vladimir, he is going crazy... Seven. The malecón caught fire, yours doesn't carry either. I killed him here. I'm going with the support of all the brothers that have remained here. I am four months pregnant and... Hey, kid, put yucca for six here... A group of six. I need to eat. Did you grab something for...? -Yes, he already ate. He is already filming me, Mom. Already? Should I go again? Do you want me to tell you everything from when I left Cuba up until now? Mom, he wants me to tell him from when I left Cuba up until today. Everything that happened to us. Look... Everything, tell it all. Are you sure I can talk about that? Yes. Have you started yet? We left Cuba on January 22... with two other friends... and we flew from Cuba at night... at 5:00 AM to Guyana. We landed the next day. That same day we landed we went looking for lodging. A hostel. -A hostel. We stayed there... Then we continued on our way all through the night, on a bus to... There we were joined by another Cuban guy, and then we traveled by bus… all over the Amazon... until we arrived in Brazil. We arrived in Brazil, we arrived in Manaus... and we stayed in a hotel. There we lived a quiet life waiting for the documents... the papers from Brazil, so, we could go back to Cuba and have the visa interview at the United States Embassy. But it didn't go as we had hoped. We had to fly to Fortaleza. We were told that there was work in Fortaleza... But when we got there... we found 13 million unemployed. They told us that if we didn't speak Portuguese they couldn't give us employment. Only for Brazilians. But they did give us our work permits really fast. One week after requesting asylum. And... Then we returned to Manaus. There was no work in Brazil. We couldn't get a job. There we met two guys... with two coyotes, who took us on a boat to Maraã. At Maraã one guy told the other to keep travelling with us. But a guy in Brazil scammed us out of 5,000 dollars... And left us stranded there. We returned to Manaus again. And when we continued with the other guy. He left us, too, in the Colombian Amazon and robbed us of another 5,000 dollars that we had. And he stayed there with them. They left us in the Colombian Amazon for 53 days. And when we got out, after 53 days... we surrendered to the military base... to see what they were going to do with us... if they were going to deport us or take us out on a plane. And they took us out on a plane... to Florencia, which is a city. From there we took a bus to Medellín. From Medellín to Turbo... we went through the jungle from Capurganá... until we got here to Panama. On the way I got dehydrated. -Tell him how the hills were like. The hills took about eight hours. The first was four, the second was six, and the third was eight. The third was eight. And I got dehydrated. I went four days without drinking water... without eating. I was transferred in a helicopter from the second checkpoint to Panama City. There at... at the Children's Hospital... I was put in an induced coma so, they could stabilize me... and I spent nine days intubated. -No, it was seven, son. Well, seven or nine, it doesn't matter. And... I had a hard time at the hospital because I didn't have my parents' support... because they couldn't... I had just 5 minutes with each parent. And... Until I recovered, and now I'm here and I'm fine. Waiting to see what we are going to do. -He says: until I recovered... So hungry! INVEST IN AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE At the end we decided to leave the caravan... on second thought, I don't think it was a good idea. Although I still believe that it's better not to walk as a group. I don't think you have enough tape to include everything in your film. On the way towards the border a woman let us sleep in her porch. She told us she had gone to Cuba on vacation... Pictures on the boardwalk... laughing next to John Lennon's statue... She gave us something to eat and spoke of Cuba all night long. She asked us what we thought of the 'dreamers' about the 'embargo' and if we were CIA agents. About free health care and education... I didn't say a word. We thanked her and left... That woman saved us. Look, uncle! Look... Mom! Look at dad! And action! Because I fell out of the jungle. And... Because... and danced. And danced. day 6 - 17 apr 17 -Be strong and go! Yes, but, listen to this: I can get to San José with $40. I'm not going to lie to you, yes, I can get there. But I won't have anything to eat, anywhere to sleep. And you can't do things this way. And there is no work in Costa Rica, the lodgings are very expensive. People who have no money save themselves by looking in Santa Cruz or El Pedregal, which are country areas. But San José, the capital of Costa Rica... How much does it cost to rent there? -To rent? It depends... There are cheaper or more expensive. Look, when people don't have money they are moved to a church. But those areas of San José and Paso Canoas are now full of Cubans. It's not a whim, of course I want to flee from here. But I can't run away with 40 dollars. Because I won't solve anything with $40. What will I eat? If a bus costs me 20. And the taxi from San José to Paso Canoas costs $16. How much did I have left? 4 dollars. And $4 is not enough for... No, I don't want any. $4 is not enough to buy a bag of cookies in Costa Rica because everything is very expensive over there. -So, you're convinced this is deportation? -Yes. As clear as water. Now, the poor shits like me who don't have one cent, we are the ones who are going to be deported. But when I get to Cuba, I won't even have a house. That's the way life is, son. I'm even leaving with a worm inside my body. It was nice meeting you. Don't worry, we'll see each other again. Take care, people. -You take care, too. Hey, come here! This is all bullshit. -We are going to throw all of that away. This is all bullshit. After topping up my phone... I’m leaving today. We each need to give 20 dollars to the driver If we don't, we're Cuba. Bye. -Put another room on hold... You hear? What are they going to do with those tents? We are going to leave them there. See you tomorrow. Bye, Marcel! What's that, Addys? Chiriquí. You already signed up. Did you sign up? -I don't know. -Do I need to do it again? Did you sign up already? -Yes, when you came by. OK. Give me your passport number, I'm here in front of Addys. Even if I have to go into the jungle ...for a year. No matter how long it takes, but I'm not going back. I have been through a lot in Cuba to turn back now... And if I go back there it will be twice the hardship. Without a home, without anything. No way. If things get bad in Chiriquí, I have tools that can cut through any type of fence. I cut a hole on the fence, run away and I'll go to... Wherever, and go back into the jungle. I'll go through the river and keep going without any fear... but I'm not giving up just like that... We crossed the jungle. -I'm not going to give up so easily. Surrender, no. They have to shoot me if they want me to go back to Cuba. I told my mom. You wait for me dead, or on an plane if I go back to visit... And I told my son: You will not see your dad for a long time. You will not see your father in a while. Because your dad is fighting for you. Where are we going? Sacrifice is hard. -Where will I live? Mom, download it through the phone's app It's called Play Store. There you can download all the applications you want. But it will take longer in Cuba because Facebook... it's about 46 MB, and with the slow internet, it gets complicated. Today the word of God speaks to us of salvation and liberation. Salvation: During his journey from Beersheba to Haran, During his journey from Beersheba to Haran, He had a dream in which he saw a ladder resting on the ground and whose top touched the sky. The ladder is an allegory of the divine initiative that precedes all human movement. It is the antithesis of the Tower of Babel, built by men who, with their own strength, wanted to reach heaven to become gods. In this case, in contrast, it is God who descends... It is the Lord who reveals himself... It is God who saves. It is Emmanuel: It is God with us. Fulfills the promise that the Lord and humanity belong to each other in the sign of a love incarnate and merciful, that gives life in abundance. Almighty God, have mercy on us, forgive us our sins... 89 people... -Nothing else? Well, there's nothing else... A bunch of buses to take me... This is until El Malecón is dry. It's not 89 buses but 89 individuals. They can fill one, two or three buses. Each bus can take 25. A caravan. -Feliciano... All the Cubans are gathered here. How are you? -Fine. How are you? -Fine. OK. My name is Feliciano Martinez. I don’t know if some of you know me or not. I’m here in Laredo, Texas. I’m a minister... International. We spoke with the government today... With Panama’s Secretary of Interior... of Panama. What we talked about... is that you’re moving to the Chiriquí camp, where I will be arriving at Saturday morning. I know you’re scared. You've got to move out from Caritas. This is the only thing that I can tell you at this point. If you want to move, it’s your decision. You’re all adults. Here in the United States, at this moment... we're not at the president's table. There are issues that need to be handled first, and we hope a decision will be made very soon regarding the Cubans… here in the United States. If someone asks you to sign a paper, simply, don’t do it. Please. Thank you very much... -Behave and... And... May God help you. Thank you! -Likewise! Bye, guys. I'm selecting the pictures of the journey through the jungle. I can't give you all of them. I want to write a book when all this is over. I'll need at least three volumes. Oh, my God. One year and four months stumbling around... Come on, it’s our turn! -I’m going right after you. The last time you asked me about my dreams... if I had dreams… well in those days I was able to remember some. In the last one, I had cut my foot while crossing a river in the jungle... the red jungle. THE HOPE THE PEOPLE OF... CUBA... WILL TRIUMPH. I am Fidel! I am Fidel! And now we present to you... the keynote speech of this event. We want to pass! We want to pass! Come on, boy, get inside, go on! Yes, that is so. Right in the middle. They won't shoot at us, they aren't going to shoot anything. We defend ourselves. Hey! Let us pass! We have nothing to do with the situation you are describing... We have nothing to do with that situation. All we want is to join those in Puerto Obaldia, with the sole purpose of going through Panama. No one wants to stay in Panama. -OK, but wait... Let us pass. Let us through, brother. We are a simple caravan... We will behave, let us pass! People are going to get hurt... We are without food, starving. We've waited a long time, boss. We are out of money and out of food and I am here with my son. Look, sir, we are Cubans and the only thing we want... Hey, watch it, they are pushing me. We want to join the caravan in Puerto Obaldia and go to the United States, we don't want to stay here. We want to join them! It's true that we are in contact with them over there. You have returned their phones already. Good afternoon, we are about to end our strike. We are apologizing to the superiors and thanking them. But also take into account the three points they agreed on with the deacon: One: There will be no deportation for us. Two: That we are going to be moved. And third: That they are going to give us papers. Hopefully they keep their word because they are high-ranking officials. I hope they don't lie to the world because this is being seen by the world. We are waiting for those solutions in 7 days. If in 7 days we are not given any solutions, we go back on strike. And as my partner said earlier: With more force and with a zipped mouth. Film this, Jenny, film all of this so you can see... They're going to lose the stars here, the bars and everything... Come on, people, come on! Let me film. I'm leaving, but let me film. Wait. I'm leaving. Look, film over there. Film over there. The hand! Hold the mouth... The tongue... He's going to die... He's going to die and we'll blame all of you. He's going to die and it is going to be your fault. Help us! Don't worry, brother, you can't die... A car... A car, please... A car, please... This man arrived and he is going to take him to a hospital in Metetí... because there is no transportation to take him. Stretch it out, don't let it get stiff. Go! Go! Go! Don't let it get stiff! Damn it! day 7 - 18 apr 17 Hold on, it's pitch black in here. Hold on a minute. Wait. Wait, Humbe... Hello! On my way to Chiriquí! Look, they cleared your tent. There's nothing left. -And the fan? Are you filming? -It's live. Live? -Are you streaming on Facebook? Film everything... -Do you have a flashlight there? Film everything. So, the people in the USA can see. It’s very dark. I left the tent. Too much weight. You're full of shit, Humbertico. For Cuba, not for Cuba. Not dead, man, not even dead. -Help me with the gentleman, please. -Come on… Hey Daniel, what's up, my brother? For Chiriquí, they say for Chiriquí. This is not good. That's right, brother. Look at all the cops here. Look at this, Humbe... Look at the buses, they're here. I can't? You can't film, buddy. You can't film. -No, it’s for your own safety. You can't film, buddy. It seems like they don’t want the people to know. No, brother, it looks like they're moving out Chapo Guzmán. With batons and everything. The police have some huge batons. You can't, buddy. Everything here is surrounded by the police. Is very dark here and you can't see very well now. And I have to have the phone hidden because they say we can't film. But wouldn't you like to see the amount of cops they have here. Out of this world. Well, if my destiny is to go to Cuba I'll going to Cuba. And that's that. I'm not going to fight this anymore. I wouldn't want to, brother, but... Anyway... It has come to this. Me neither, brother, but what can we do? What are we going to do? There's nothing else to do. That's it. Brother, I have no choice. Brother, where am I going to go? Where will I go, brother? There's already a list there, brother. This is it! We triumphed. We're at the prison of Rio Grande, in Texas. We'll be here for a while until they can process the 'credible fear' because we have requested asylum. -Lazaro, they are calling for you to get inside. -Tell them I'm on my way. We're very happy. Hey, write me! Oh my God. Put that inside. Marcel, give me a kiss... Talk to my mom and tell her everything. Take care. Don't get angry at me, Marcel... but I ask you not to put names in the film. I'll tell you later what my attorney told me. I know you'll understand... Do you think it'll give me problems if I wanted to return to see my mother? I think this is the last thing I can write... This is where the movie ends.
