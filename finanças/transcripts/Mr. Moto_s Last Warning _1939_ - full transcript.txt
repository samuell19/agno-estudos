[MUSIC PLAYING] STREETLY: The two French squadrons are here now, Bentham, off Tunis. They plan to sail direct to Port Said and proceed through the canal to join our fleet for the maneuvers on the Red Sea. -When, exactly, will they reach the canal? -We had a wire from the French admiral this morning. It says, "Fleet arrives Port Said 23 o'clock, 16th instant. Complements, Delacour, Admiral commanding. -There's even less time than I thought. Isn't it possible to delay them somehow? -What's the matter you Secret Service people? Why on earth shouldn't the French fleet proceed? -Last week, one of our men in Egypt reported he was on the verge of finding out something, which might be in trouble in connection with these joint maneuvers. -That's nonsense. What trouble could there be, man? Our relations with France are as corny as they ever were-- more so, in fact. -What I'm afraid of, Lord Streetly, is that there's some scheme on foot to strain those relations. -What? That would be disastrous, Bentham. Disastrous! -Exactly, sir, with this present tension in Europe. Can't you do something to detain that French fleet until we get more news? -I'll tell you what. I'll speak to the Prime Minister. Perhaps we can persuade the French admiralty to hold the fleet off Tunis for the balance of this week. We can't do more than that. -We will accordingly remain here until order is received. Hand this off to Paris, and take this message for my wife on the steamer "Emalia," reaching Port Said tonight. -A radio message for you, Madame Delacour. -Message? -Mamma, is it from Father? Is it from Father, Mamma? -Yes. Yes, dear. He sends you his love. -Uh, no bad news, I hope, madame? -Oh, no, Monsieur Norvel. Merely disappointing. -Oh, Mamma! Aren't you gonna see Father after all? Aren't we, Mamma? -Of course, we are, darling. -The, uh, naval maneuvers have not been called off? -Oh, no. Just a change of orders. -Oh. It must be very interesting to receive important information like that before anyone else. -Ha, ha. Admiral's wives are always the last to hear of anything of real importance. -I admire your discretion, madame. -I say, when do we land? I just come from the [INAUDIBLE], um, looking at the town. Ooh! What a sinister, brooding place. -Did you get the sinister, brooding smell of it? -Oh, I did. I-- I think, I've just thought of a marvelous heading from my third chapter. Listen to this. "Port Said, the glamorous gateway to the mystic East." -Aren't you infringing a little bit on Mr. Halliburton? -I never heard of him. -You should find plenty of material here for your book, Monsieur Venables. -Am I in your book, Rollo? I want to be in your book. -Oh, of course, you're in the book. You're all in it. Listen to this. Just-- just a few notes. Just listen. "The adventure begins. Moonlight madness, shipmates and deck companions, and the Oriental Sherlock. -What's a Sherlock? -He means Monsieur Moto, darling. -Oh, by the way, where is Mr. Moto? I'd like to say goodbye to him. -There is no need yet for goodbyes. Business returns me in Port Said for several days, before I continue my journey. -Where are you staying, Mr. Moto? -At the home of friends. -Uh, do you, by any chance, know a wayside inn? You know, a place with local color, of whirling dervishes, and-- and so forth? -Where tourists find their throats cut? -Yes, that's exactly what I mean, I think. PURSER: First class passengers will assemble in the lounge for passport inspection. -Come along, Marie. We will find Nana and show our passports. Say goodbye, now. -Goodbye, then. See you there. Oh, now look here. No. No, really. Somebody-- somebody must have stolen my passport. What? -Didn't I see you press your passport in your notebook? -Oh, yes. There it is. Th-- that's very clever, Mr. Moto. Thank you, so much. Well, goodbye, old boy. -All right. -We'll see you at the hotel? -All right. Goodbye. -Mr. Norvel, this man said he has business with you. -Oh, the travel agent, eh? -Hawkins is my name. Bert Hawkins. We made all your arrangements, sir. -Get my reservation for the hotel? -Yes, sir. And I hope that everything is satisfactory. -Well, it seems to be, so far. -Excuse me, please. I too must go through the formality of passport examination. -Have you got a match, Hawkins? -I don't think as how I have, sir. -Why don't you look in your left-hand pocket? -Oh, yes. Here's a packet, sir. -That Japanese, is the man. Have you got your instructions? -Yes, sir. I've got a cab waiting. -All right. Help me through the customs, and we'll pick him up there. -Very good, sir. -Officer, my permit and credentials, please. -We'll wait for him outside. -Hey. -Well, what on earth are you carrying all that for? -Well, my dear chap, it's curious how you want to carry that kid. -I'm so very sorry. -I regret, it was entirely my fault. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [FAKE COUGH] -Find me a conveyance, please. -Here he comes. -Now! -Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Are you all right, Mr. Moto? -Yes, please. My own fault. -No harm done. Uh, won't you let me give you a lift? I'll be glad to drive you any place you want to go. -You're most kind, Mr. Norvel, but I must not trouble you. -Oh, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. No trouble at all. I'm going to the Khedive Hotel. You might just as well drive with us. Come on, Mr. Moto. Come on, jump in, Mr. Moto. Adam. -This is not the Khedive Hotel. -No, but it's where you get out. Come on. -You had better do what he says, Mr. Moto. -Please, I don't understand. -Come on. Get moving. -What do you want with me? -Never you mind. None of your monkey tricks. Inside. Well, that's the end of Mr. Moto. -What are you calling your book, Mr. Venables? -Roughing it With a Rolling Stone, or A Peep Into the Interior. -Good. -Hi, Norvel! -Oh, good evening, good evening. I see you're all settled and comfortable, eh? -Yes, but Marie was tired out. Her nurse has put her to bed. Won't you sit down? -Oh, thank you. -You know, I was just saying to Madame Delacour, we should see the town. You know, the real Port Said. Not this stuff the tourists see. -That's an excellent idea. But you must be very careful, he's a venturesome soul, you know. -Oh, now, now, now. Uh, you're pulling my leg. -Oh, you know I wouldn't do that. -Uh, this Thursday, why don't you join us? -I'm sorry, but I have a business appointment. And anyway, I'm not a desperate foe, like you. I'm nervous. -Uh, Mr. Eric Norvel? -Yes. -I have a message for you. Very urgent, by hand. -Oh, thank you. Uh, excuse, please. There's no answer. Well, that's excellent, my appointment has been cancelled. -Ah. -Oh, good. -Now I can come with you, Marco Polo. -Marco-- -Shall we show this fire-eater the real Port Said? Or shall I take you to the local musical hall? -Alfred, don't lie to me. I saw you dabbling about in the gutter. What were you doing? -Looking for a novelty for my lady friend. [LAUGHTER] -Well, don't you think it's time you married the girl? -Blimey, no. It gives me the creeps to see her once a week. [LAUGHTER] -Alfred, you shouldn't belittle matrimony. Married men live longer than single ones. -Oh, ho. It only seems longer. [LAUGHTER] FABIAN: I think that you had better go into you song. -All right. I'll sing a song, if you drink a glass of water and smoke a cigarette with your left hand. -Very well. What are you going to sing? -"Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road." -Oh, no you're not. You're going to sing something classical. Opera. -What? -Carry on. Music, Professor. -You carry on. Light your cigarette. What's the matter? Can't you find a lynch? Ha, ha. Look in my left-hand pocket, ya fool. Heh, heh. Bet you don't know how to make a Maltese cross. FABIAN: Well, how would you make a Maltese cross, young man? -By pulling his tail. -Music, Professor. (SINGING) I've no right to live beside the seaside. I've no right to live beside the sea. I've no right to stroll upon the prom-- prom-- prom, where the brass man is playing tiddly hum pum pum. So just let me be beside the seaside. I'll be beside myself with glee. And there's lots of girls beside, I should like to be beside, beside the seaside beside the sea. -Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for the way you've received our little offering. -Shut up, Fabian. -We do our best to entertain you. -Hurry up, ya big dummy. I got friends coming back here. This is intermission. Get off, ya big ham. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] -Will you excuse me for a smoke? -Well, certainly. -Hello, Markaday-- he's marvelous. Well, he, uh, juggles things, you know? STAGEHAND: Get that surrey over here. Please. You, you, come on, give me the cart. Give me the cart. Come on. Come on. Everybody's coming. Come on. We'll do this lot. Why, come on. Come on, come on. You see, everybody in the jungle. There is music here, regularly. That's the one. It can't go on. I've got to go on, myself. -Not doing this, mister. Always the same story, night after night after night! And then to catch you in the alley. Your fur foreman suffers. Oh, shame! Come on, the show must go on! [FAINT VOICES] MAN: Phase one, now the project. [FAINT VOICES] MAN: I have his passport. [FAINT VOICES] FABIAN: I'm sorry for using melodramatic tricks to get you men up here, but then we can't be too careful. Norvel, here, arrived tonight on the Amalia. And by a strange coincidence, Mr. Moto of the International Police was also aboard. MAN: Norvel? -Norvel warned me by cablegram, and I arranged for Mr. Moto to be taken care of. I only mention this to show you there's always a possibility of our being watched. And never forget, there must be nothing to show what government is employing us. The slightest mistake means death. Now, Norvel, did you learn the date? -Not yet. But that Delacour woman had a radiogram from her husband tonight. Looks as if the fleets arrival has been postponed. -Hm. That's either very good or very bad. Gives us more time, but it might mean suspicion. Nevertheless, we'll go through it. Nothing must stop us, nothing. -It's a good job Mr. Moto is out of the way. He was dangerous. -Yes. I'm just about to cancel him. -What have you got there? -A little collection of my own that's taken me a long time to compile. This the reverse of what police call a Rose Gallery. NORVEL: Oh, a detective's gallery, huh? FABIAN: Detective, Secret Service men, police of all nationalities. -Can I have a look? -There he is. NORVEL: Huh? Huh!. Huh! -Well, so much for Mr. Moto. -That's really a magnificent idea. May I? -Surely. -How much remains to be done, Fabian? -A day's work, Norvel. You and I will complete the project. NORVEL: It is near completion then? Oh that is good. I had no idea you would be so far advanced by this time. FABIAN: Have you taken care of your end, Danforth? -I have fixed the passport and entered to enter into any Aegean or Asiatic port, but it's been a drawback not knowing our exact plans. -You'll know in plenty of time. Now all of you go back and watch the rest of the show. Norvel, we must know what's in that radiogram. -I'll get it for you tonight. Don't worry. -Good. Report in later at Connie's place. [STOOL SQUEAKING] -Quiet! What was that? -I didn't hear anything. -Neither did I. -I'm afraid you're overly suspicious, Mr. Fabian. -Perhaps. I don't trust anyone. Not even Alfred. I'll walk back with you as far as the pass door. [CLUNKING] -Wait a minute. Aren't you late, Monsieur Markaday? You'd better hurry. -Oh, oui. [THEATER APPLAUSE] -Wait a minute. Look! -Shh. -Search all the dressing rooms, right away. He's back stage, somewhere. Hakin, watch the stage door. We'll search all the dressing rooms. Mine first. -There's no one here. I'll take this floor, you go up to the next level. -All right. -I shouldn't do that, if I were you, Mr. Burke. It isn't worthy of your excellent position with the British Secret Service. -Who are you? -I'm your friend. You are in a more dangerous position than I am. -But who are you? -Don't give yourself away by removing your photograph. Continue to search for me, I'm Moto. Meet me at 42 Shagan tonight, directly opposite Connie's place. Watch out! -Any trace of him? -No. Let's go and find Fabian. [THEATER APPLAUSE] -There's no sign of him in any of the dressing rooms. -Never mind. You had better get back to Madame Delacour. -All right. -What? Are you crazy? What is the meaning of this betray? -What's the trouble here? -My Berry, she's very bad girl. She did not another whole performance then comes right in here. I come following her, and these boys, he assassinate me. -I'm terribly sorry. I can explain everything. Now just a minute. Somebody robbed my dressing room, and I saw Monsieur Markaday sneaking around here and I jumped on him. [WHIP CRACKING] [THEATER APPLAUSE] -He must gone through this window. -I will have a search man. And you, please, sir, keep your mutt [INAUDIBLE] between performance. -Well, that's one thing, at any rate. Whoever he was, he couldn't have heard much listening in there. -He listened, and that's too much. That's all, Danforth. I'll phone you when I need you. -Yes, sir. -Say, Alfred, don't think this gentleman bears a strange resemblance to Mr. Danforth? -Now do you know me, Chankina? -Ain't she? Where's Miss Connie? -I don't know, Mr. Fabian. -Go find her for me. -Go find her yourself. What's the matter, got a complaint about something? -Have you got any iodine? -Oh, been speaking out of turn, again, huh? OK. I'll get some iodine and bring it up to your room. Hey, Bill. [WHISTLE] -Hello, darling. Oh! Let's have a look. -Oh, it's nothing. I just wanted to tell you I'm expecting a visitor tonight, a man called Norvel. -All right. But what did you do to that hand? -A dog at the theater nipped me. -Uh-huh, I don't want you to go foaming at the mouth around here. Come on, and give us that nip. -Why don't you let bloke alone? Take more than a dob bite to hurt him. -Oh, be as funny as you like, but in the filthy town it might be serious. -A wolf hound once bit Alfred and all he got was splinters. -I'm getting a bit fed up on your jokes. -Don't listen to her, Alfred. -It was funny at first, but now it's getting part a laugh. Why you-- you actually treat that dummy as-- as though it were a human being. -Oh, getting in shouting, eh? -Oh, I'm sick of Alfred. To tell you the truth, I'm sick of the whole dirty business you're in, whatever it is. Why can't we be together more? Why all this hide-and-seek? Why do I have to run a dive like this and pretend I hardly know you? -Wait a minute. -I've always done what you told me to, without asking questions, but now I've got to know. Why do you pretend to be a third-rate music hall turn? What's your real game? Why don't you let me in on it, so I can help you? -You've said enough now. Be quiet. -Sorry, I didn't mean to go flying off the handle like that. I guess it's 'cause I love you so much. -Hm. So you want to know about my business, huh? -Mm, hm. -All right. Take a seat in the office. Because you're so curious, I'm going to tell you everything. -Wait a minute. -Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. -OK, hold that hand still and-- now talk. [MAN SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Anyone here? -Yes, Mr. Burke. I'm sorry to welcome you so inhospitably, but darkness is necessary if we are to observe the movements of the enemy. Please, sit down. -You really are Moto, then? -That is my one permanent characteristic. -But I thought Moto was dead. Fabian doesn't usually make mistakes. -He made a grave mistake tonight when he murdered a countryman of mine. And he will regret it. -Was this man deliberately posing as you? -He was my collar. Keeping Mr. Norvel under observation. Incidentally, he diverted suspicion from itself. You see at present An Kuroki, dealer in oriental art. And I'm in Port Said now for quite some time. -How did you know me? -You were, I believe, in Atbah, about two years ago, posing there as a British priest. -But I thought only our Secret Service knew about that? -You may remember that extremely dirty mule driver who accompanied you to the border? -What that-- -Oh, yes. -Moto, I'm beginning to believe all the stories I've heard about you. -Please, do not. I do not. But should we not return to our present assignment? I'm interested in the extent of your information. -It isn't nearly enough. Fabian doesn't confide in his men, he merely uses them. -But you sent a report to London only last week. -It was more warning than report. All I was able to tell them was that there's a plot to cause trouble between England and France, which has some connection with the visit of the French fleet. -That undoubtedly explains they're postponed arrival. -But they can't hold them long unless we discover Fabian's exact plans. -Observe, Mr. Norvel is arriving. -Come back later. [BAR HALL MERRIMENT] -(SINGING) Bring back, bring back, bring back my bonnie to me. My bonnie lies over the ocean. My bonnie lies over the sea. My bonnie lies over the ocean. Oh, bring back my-- -Why, here, Mr. Norvel. You remember me don't you? Captain Hawkins of the "Vulcan." -Oh, yes. How are you, Captain? -Fine, thanks. -Where's Fabian? -Upstairs. Room number 10. And tell him I'm down here, will ya? -Well, glad have seen you, Captain. -Right. -(SINGING) Oh, bring back my bonnie to me. -When you get down, see if Norvel has come. -All right, dear heart. -Oh, here he is now. Connie, this is Mr. Norvel. He just arrived from Europe. This is Miss Porter, the proprietor here. -Please to meet you. -I am honored. -See ya later, maybe, Mr. Fabian. And take care of that hand. -Come in. -Very attractive, the proprietor. -Don't do any talking in front of her, but if you have to, we're in a smuggling racket. I had to tell her that, because she was getting too curious. -Oh, I see. A-- an intimate friend, eh? -I've known her for six years. I helped her dodge the English police and I got her out of the country. She's all right, but I'm not taking any chances. Did you get that radiogram? -Yes, I copied it and put it back in her bag so that Madame Delacour shouldn't become suspicious. But it doesn't help us at all. Here's all it says. "Changed orders. Will not see you until three days later than expected. My love to you and Marie." -Well, who's Marie? -Oh, a child, about five years old. -Can't you get the woman to talk? -She's the very essence of discretion. -Well, it's vital that we find out that date. -But can't we just make our preparations and then wait until the French ships are sighted? -Oh, use your head, man. We've got to get everything ready for a definite time, and then lie low. We're being watched, and we don't know who is watching us. -Well, at least we got rid of Mr. Moto. -But who was the man in the theater? And here, have a look at this. You ever seen this face before? The beard's my own idea. Somebody who was in my dressing tonight started to tear this thing out and then stopped. Who is it? -Danforth. -Of course. -But he couldn't possibly be a British agent. It was he who fixes our fake passports to get out of here. -Those passports were forged in Cairo by a man called Danforth who I've never seen. This man's Burke. Somehow he intercepted the real Danforth coming up here. -Well, what are we going to do? -Do you recall Mr. Burke suggesting he'd like to know our exact plans? -Yes. -Well, I'm going to show him what it's all about. -Ah. -I think he'll be interested, and very useful. -Aha! Well, in the meantime, I'm going to work on a new plan to get that date. -See that you do. And phone Mr. Burke Danforth at the Marina Hotel, tonight. -Mm. -Be very pleasant. Tell him I want him here just before dawn, say, uh, 4:30. -Whichever way I turn, I come up against a strong wall. I've never known so little at this stage of a case. -I, too, must confess to a feeling of futility. Mr. Fabian's methods display a certain genius. -We don't even know the name of the ship they got those papers for. -And that ship, perhaps, is the key. You better go now, Mr. Burke, we'll meet again tomorrow afternoon. -Where? -I'll phone you. What is your address? -A small hotel called the Marina. [KNOCKING] -You must not be seen here. You'll find another door in the back room. [KNOCKING] -Good evening, please? -Oh, uh, are-- are you open? -Closing now for hours. But I'll reopen for number one customer. -Oh, dear. That-- that sign, there, says you speak English. -I speaking English very fluent. -Oh, me savvy. Uh, me, look see in window. Me want to buy number one piecey. -Oh, entering, please. -Thank you, very much. -Entering, please, my humble shop. -Oh, it's awfully nice, now. Oh. Oh, what wonderful antiques! -Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Supreme collection. Buddhas, all dynasties, scrolls, all assortment, weapons, all burglars. Suiting you? -No, not tonight, thanks. Um, me see ring in window. -Yes, sir. -How much is? -This one? -No, no. Not that one. No. No, the scarab ring. -Ah so! Gentleman having first class knowledge. This ring being very ancient. Observe. Being said to come from tomb of Cleopatra. -No? -Yes, sir. -Oh, I say. Uh, plenty too much money, maybe? -Oh, no, no. Being new customer, I selling cheap. 60 piastres, maybe? -Oh, I say. That is jolly decent of you. But I-- I really-- -Oh, no, no, no. But making small reduction. 40 piastres suiting you? But promising, always handle with great care. -Oh, yes, rather. Well, I-- I thank you. I'm very much obliged to you. -Pleased, sir. -I have to give you a five pound note. -Oh, yes, sir. Bringing very grand. Hoping to make change. A thorough changing, please. But being correct amount. -What? All is piastre three? -Yes, sir. -Oh, what an oversized pound. Oh, thank you, very much. -Pleased. -That's not the same. -Here he comes. VENABLES: I shall certainly be back tomorrow. MOTO: Thanking you. Thanking you. -Thank you, very much. Well, nighty, nighty, Mr, uh, Kuroki. Oh, yes. -Hey, buddy. -Eh? -Your shoe is untied. -Oh, is it really? Well, thanks so much, old boy. Uh, help! This is obviously a case of mistaken identity. Oh, help! Police! Police! This is mine. This is mine. Hey, I am a stranger here, you know? -Get on him! Get him! Get him! -You be walking, please? -Yes, I think so, thank you. Oh, dear. I, uh, thank you, very muchy. Aha, they no catchy money. -Oh, better hiding it, please. And speak English. I understanding. VENABLES: Well, thank you, very much, Mr. Kuroki, I'm deeply grateful. It was wonderful. -Being very simple. Judo often miscalled by foreigners Jujitsu. Oh. You riding home in auto-bile. -OK. [LAUGHING] -No, no, no. Please, in here. -Oh, oh. certainly. -You staying at Kitty's Hotel? -Uh, yes. I am, yes. -To Kitty's Hotel, please. -Well, now, now, Mr. Kur-- I'll see you tomorrow. -Yes. Yes, sir. But humbly suggesting change of costume, then. -Oh, I see what you mean. Yes. Uh, wear something as if I looked I wasn't working, probably. -Uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. -That's a jolly good scheme. Good night Mr, uh, Kuroki. -Thank you. -There you are, sir. They didn't got our passport. -You boys missed something, just now. -Yeah, what? -A nice scrap outside. -Nothing new in this aristocratic neighborhood. -Oh, this was. A little bit of a Japanese playing ping pong with a couple of bruisers. -A Japanese? -Yes, Kuroki. The shop keeper from over the way. Why, there he is, sitting right behind ya. -Good evening, please. -Nice work, Mr. Kuroki. You boys better keep civil, or Mr. Kuroki might get rough with you. -I knowing who you are. -Yeah? -Oh, yes. -Very interesting. -You funny, favorite. I see you over at Dovistomy. Talking stomach, very clever. -So you've been to show, have you? -Oh, yes. I liking everything, but you best. Very funny. -Were you at the show tonight? -Oh, yes. Seeing show every Friday. Being great admirer of artists. Having drink with me, please? -No, thanks. Connie, I think this dressing ought to be changed. -OK. I'll do it. -Were you hurt in hand, please? Being very sorry. -A dog at the theater bit me. -Oh, yes. Seeing him in show. Very clever dog. -Mm, hm. -See you later. Good night, Mr. Kuroki. -Good night, sir. Good night, Miss Porter. Having a drink with me, please? -No. I didn't drink with no strangers, see? What's more, I don't owe with no foreigners neither, see? -Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I thinking gentleman not liking me. -Don't pay any bloom against that bloke, here, Mr. Kuroki. He always gets like that when he's had a couple of beers. -Oh, yeah. Who is he, please? Sailor man? -Yes. He's the captain of the blooming "Vulcan." -Thanking you, very much. -And thank you. -What's all this with little Kuroki? -Nothing, maybe. But I've got a hunch he might be more than he seems. -You mean a revenue man? -Um, something of the sort. Now look, I'm going to be away most of tomorrow, and I want you to do something for me. -Does that mean, uh, I'm really in with you? -I told you, didn't I? -Oh, perhaps I didn't think you meant it. -Certainly, I meant it. Now listen, tomorrow, all the time that I'm gone, I want you to watch Kuroki. -Kuroki? [BOAT WHISTLE] -Where are we going? -Out to the salvage boat, the "Vulcan." -The "Vulcan," eh? That must be the ship the port clearances were for. -Yes, I think you'll find it very interesting. [BOAT WHISTLE] -Is this the car? -Yes. Oh, look! Go away. Go away. Uh, "inkee." Yes, yes. Ah, look, Norvel arranged everything. He's gone to get the picnic basket now. I say, I'm dying to see that ancient tomb he was talking about, aren't you? -What's a tomb, Rollo? -Well, it's-- it's, uh, welll, I can't-- -Monsieur Norvel told me nothing about a tomb. He just invited us to a desert breakfast. -Oh, I say, I-- I have let the cat out of the bag, haven't I? -What cat, Rollo. What bag was it in? -Oh, just a little ti-- oh, don't, now. -Oh, good morning. I'm sorry I'm late. -Say, this is gripping, really, isn't it? -What's gripping, Rollo? -Well, shall we start. -Uh, you know where to go, driver. -Analapun. -Yes. -Take this, and show Mr. Kuroki in. -Yes, sir. This way, Mr. Kuroki. -How do you do? -It is good of you to receive me so promptly, General. -Not at all. Not at all. Please, sit down. Well, how is that mare's nest they sent you to ferret out llama? Ha, ha, ha. -The nest is here, beyond doubt. But, uh, I'm afraid we shall find it to be that of a tiger. -Oh, then you know more? Uh, but the last time, you were doubtful. -Oh, yes, General. But now I have more than a suspicion. -Well, what do you want us to do? Make some arrests, a couple of platoons, anything you like, you know. -Later perhaps. At present, I merely wish information concerning a vessel named the "Vulcan." -"Vulan." Oh, oh, see's just a salvage ship working on a wreck a couple of miles off shore. -Oh, so? A illegitimate enterprise? -Oh, differently. Some sill cargo boat when and got herself rammed and sunk a few weeks ago. And, uh, the owners commissioned the "Vulcan" to salvage her. -May I be permitted to investigate this ship, General? -Oh, certainly, but if you're barking up that tree, Mr. Moto, you certainly will find the mare's nest. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Um, I'll-- I'll arrange for a cutter to take you out tomorrow. -Thank you, General. Would you please tell me the location of this wreck? -Oh, cert-- certainly. Certainly. Her she is up here. There she is, that little red fellow, you see? Lying in, uh, 15 fathoms of water on her. MOTO: And that is where the "Vulcan" is anchored today? GENERAL: Yes. -Lower away. -Neat, isn't it? We do enough salvage work to satisfy the Port Authorities, or any investigator. Then we get on with our job, like the three divers below, now. -What amazing luck to find a wreck just where you wanted it. -Not luck. The ship belonged to our employers. And we arranged to sink it here, at the mouth of the canal. -You still haven't told me what the divers are actually doing. -Don't tell me you can't figure that out, Mr. Danforth. -Planting explosives? -At the entrance of the canal. In a few more hours, we'll have the whole area mined, with depth charges controlled from shore. -What an idea. Destroy the French fleet as it starts through. -Well, the leading ships, at any rate. They'll block the entrance. You're so interested in the work, you ought to say it for yourself Mr. Danforth. Come over here. Ever been down in a diving bell? You'll find it quite an experience. It's a bit cramped for two. -Yes, I should imagine it is. -Well, I'm going to stand aside and let you go alone. Help him in. -Just a minute. Uh, I'd, uh, I'd like to understand a little more, Fabian. -Isn't it clear to you, yet? Anyway, there's a phone in there. We'll be in touch. All right. -Well, hurry with them wing bolts. So, lower away. -Directly it's on the bottom, connect me. -Hello, hello, Danforth. Are you on the bottom yet? All right, hold on a minute. -Hello, Danforth. How's the view? -Not bad at all, Fabian. Congratulations, very nice work, indeed. But you'll never make France believe England did it. -Oh, I think I can handle that all right. Suppose there's evidence to show that whole thing was managed by a British Secret Service agent? How would that do? And suppose we called the agent S-14? You had better hurry if you wanted to say anything. It's a pity we forgot to put oxygen tanks in the bell. -All right, Fabian. You've got me. But you'll never succeed. -Thousand to one I do. Cut that cable. So long, Mr. Burke. -Turn him lose. -You're being very certain, please, that Mr. Danforth is not there? Oh, so? Please tell him, when seeing him, that Mr. Kuroki calling. -How do you spell the name please? -"Kee," like in kimono. -Ah, oh sure! Kuroki. Yafman, here. I have a message for you. Would you like me to read it out loud for your own information? Yeah, uh, here is it. "Boss has sent for me, period. May learn enough to make full report tonight." End of message, mien Herr. -Thanking you, very much. And please being certain to tell Mr. Danforth when returning that Mr. Kuroki, expecting him. Very important, please. [RECORD PLAYING] -Hello, dear. I was getting worried about you. -I thought I told you not to fool with Alf. Now leave him alone. -Oh, I didn't hurt your pet! -Norvel called or been here? -Hasn't called, hasn't been. -I wonder what's keeping him? What about Kuroki? -This morning he went to the Port Commandant's office. Came out in about 15 minutes. Then he gave me the slip, but he's back at his shop now. -Went to the Commandant, did he? CONNIE: I didn't think it was good, myself. What's it mean? That he is a revenue man? -Don't you worry your head, honey. If you're coming to the show, you'd better get changed. And on your way down send Hakim up, will you? -Right, you are. -I believe your laundries back. -What, all ready? -Yeah, they refused it. -Oh, you're dippy. Fabian will see you right away in his room. -All right. Hey, wake up! Hey! -Ha, ha! [KNOCKING] -Come in. Oh. -Miss Connie says as how you wanted to see me. -That's right. I've got a job for you. -Well, anything you say, governor. -I want you to make one of those packages of yours and have it ready for tonight. -Blimey, who we going to do in this time? -Mr. Kuroki. [HORN HONKING] NEWSREEL: Meanwhile, in the Mediterranean, French squadrons proceed full speed ahead to the gigantic Naval maneuvers to be held with Great Britain in the Red Sea. With all Europe engaged in the quest for the armament race, the tension grows daily. Only a spark is needed to touch off the tinder box of the world. But as long as England and France remain close friends, war clouds in Europe are unlikely. -Hello, Fabian. Sorry I couldn't get back any sooner. -Did you learn the date? -Yes. The trick with the child worked. When we went on that picnic to the desert this afternoon, I managed to get the child away from her mother. And she told me she was going to see her father tomorrow morning. -Good. That won't give anybody time to stop us. But you and I will have to work most of the night. -Starting when? -As soon as I've taken Connie home. She's out front. Meanwhile, I have some news for you. -Yes? -The man who was listening next door was Kuroki. A Japanese who keeps a junk shop opposite Connie's Place. -Japanese, eh? -What's more, Kuroki is really Mr. Moto. -He's-- but that is impossible. -Everything fits too well. -Have you got rid of him? -Hakim's on the job, now. But I want you to check on it. -Could you tell me where Mr. Fabian's dressing room is? -It's the third door down, on your left. -Thanks. -What did I you? He is human, after all. NORVEL: Don't you expect any trouble about getting away? FABIAN: Our mines will blow the French flag ship to bits. During the commotion, nobody will notice the "Vulcan" slip away. Our papers are all in order, sailing permit, everything. Even visas for the passengers. -Well, that's fine. See you later. -Right. -Ah, good evening. I thought I'd come back and see you. -Didn't you enjoy the show, Miss Porter? -Oh. FABIAN: Be sure to take care of that right away, Norvel. Come in, Connie. Come in. Who told you to come back stage? -And who told you to lie to me? -What's the matter with you? -So you didn't want me to know what you were really up to. -Now wait a minute. -Oh, it's no use trying to deny it. I heard you just now. Smuggling! That's a fine word to use to blow hundreds of men to bits and start another war. -That's enough. -And don't think you can get away it. -Now listen to me. You're in this as deep as any of us and you're going to come along with me, and not say a word to anybody! Alf, what do you think of her? Tells a man she's been in love with him for six years, and then wants to see him hanged. And why? Because he's working against a company that wanted to send her to jail. Hm! And if it hadn't been for me, she'd be rotting right now in Dartmoor prison. That's gratitude for you, isn't it? Oh, what's the matter, darling? Listen, you've nothing to thank England for. Why you can't even go back there, ever. Come on now, be sane. Stick with me, him? -Oh! -Please, anala. Please, anala. Anala. [KNOCKING] [KNOCKING] -Good evening, please. [CRACKLING] [STREET COMMOTION] -Hey, Otto. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [KNOCKING] -Oh, I'm awfully sorry. Ghastly clumsy of me. -I begging pardon, please. -Say, if it's Mr. Kuroki. -Excusing please, but being in great haste. -I say, how do you like this kit? Those roughs wouldn't try and pick my pockets, now, eh? -Mr. Venables, you are an Englishman. You would do your country a service, wouldn't you? -I say, I think you're talking differently. You are, Mr. Kuroki, aren't you? -There is no Kuroki. I am Moto, agent of the International Police. -Oh, that's splendid. What? -It isn't simple, I know. But this, Mr. Venables may convince you. -But I know Mr. Moto. He was on the boat with me. -It was a fellow agent of mine, passing as myself for reasons of duty. -By Jove! -You will assist me, Mr. Venables? -Oh, I say! Why, what an adventure! -Then go to the Port Commandant at once and tell him Moto needs immediate assistance, in f You understand? -Yes, sir. [KNOCKING] -Uh, you wait for me here, driver. Hey, where-- w-w-- oh, Dr. Livingston, I presume? -No, no, no. It's Venables. It's Venables. The very man I want to see. -Well, what-- what on earth are you doing here, and in these clothes? -Oh, look. It is vitally important. It's-- it's a matter of life and death, Secret Service, king and country. -But what is all this? -Mr. Moto, the real one. He's on a big job in that warehouse, over there. I-- I must go to the Port Commandant immediately and get help. Let me go in your car, please. -No, now, wait. You really seem to be in the midst of things, don't you? -Oh, come along, now. Hurry. -Oh, come along, now. Hurry. Hurry. -No, no, no, no. Hurry. -No, no, no, no. Wait a minute. I have a better idea. -Yes? -I'll send my driver with a message for the Port Commandant, and you and I will go back to the warehouse. Don't you realize, Mr. Moto might be in danger. -Oh, of course, that's a brilliant scheme. Thanks, awfully, what. Come along. We must hurry. Come along. We must hurry. Come on. Come on. -All I can say, Zachy, my lad, I hope as how you really did get him. -He was in the back room at the time of the explosion. -What we should have done, we should have took him aboard the "Vulcan" and dropped him over the side, the same as we done with the other one. [DOOR OPENING] -Oh, a body! -Hawkins, where are you? -Here, Mr. Norvel. Anything wrong? Blimey, who's this? -Have you seen Mr. Moto? Have you-- have you see-- why, I don't understand. Uh, don't point that at me. Oh! -Keep quiet. Have you heard of anything? This fool says Moto is in here. -What? -Moto? NORVEL: You bungled your job. Go and search the place. -Why you dirty rotten-- -He-- he's out. -Yeah, so is the other one. -All right, now. Tie 'em both up in socks and drop 'em over. -Yes, that's what we should have done in the first place. Blimey, that pup, there, give me a nasty scratch. -All right, now. Hurry up. I'm going to report to Fabian. -All right, come on, then. Get the sacks, Hakin. -Here they are. -Got plenty of weights in 'em? -Yep, They'll go straight to the bottom. -Good. Oh, he's coming to. Good. Now let's see if you're slippery enough to get out of this. -Oh, your cheek is bleeding. I'm sorry, Captain Hawkins. -Yeah, you'll be sorry for yourself in half a minute. Come in, in ya go. Oh, that scratch wasn't, by any chance, caused by the ring on Mr Rollo's hand? -Well, what if it was? -Oh, ha, ha. It would be amusing. -What is all this? I'll knock that smile off your dial in a minute. Come on. What's making ya laugh? -The justice of the poets, Captain. To wrap the salt, in other words. Your face. -My face? What about my face? -Oh, poor Captain Hawkins. I do cherish a fellow feeling for you. After all, we are both rapidly nearing death. -What? -He's indiffering to gain time. -Hold yer row. What is it, now? -Oh. -Come on, out with it. Out with it. -But it is quite simple cap Hawkins You see, I sold that ring to Mr. Rollo. The ring is very ancient. And if you were to examine it carefully, you would find a spring which releases a small needle between the eyes of the scarab. I'm very sorry for you, poor Captain Hawkins. But that point was impregnated with, uh, towak. -What's that? Poison? -One of the deadliest known. -I don't believe ya. Undo that sack. Let's have a deck of that ring. [BOAT'S_WHISTLE_BLOWING] -Blimey, there ain't nothing in it, at all. -Go on. Go on. It's all right to talk in front of her. She's gonna be with me all the time. -But the explosion didn't kill Moto. -What? -He was in the warehouse. But we've got them both. I told Hawkins to, uh-- -Right. But we'll make sure. There's been too many mistakes. Come on, Connie. -Me? -Yes, honey. You're gonna be with us on everything. Come on. -Try and fool me, would ya. -What have you been so long about? -Well, this hoary had to tell me some yarn about a ring with a spike in it. And there wasn't no spike at all. -Stop chattering and get rid of these. Now, while I'm watching. Hurry up. Now we can on with our work. Connie. -She's gone. -Connie! -Hello? Hello, give me the Port Commandant, quickly. Quick-- -So you're trying to double-cross me after all. -I tried to stop you, and I will stop you. [GASPING] -I don't think so. [COUGHING] -Well, well, uh, h-- how did we get here? -Talk low, please. We are supposed to be dead. -We-- eh, uh, dead? -Extremely dead. They tied us in sacks and dropped us off this wharf. -Well, isn't the whar-- uh, how did we get here? -I was fortunate enough to obtain a piece of steel, which enabled me to cut myself loose. And then to save you. A little chore, of course. Whew! -Oh, I say, uh, thanks awfully. -Now, Mr. Venables, listen carefully to what I say. -There. Everything is ready now. -Now, look here, Fabian. Why must I do this? You know I've had no experience with this sort of thing. -Because I'm not trusting anyone but myself to give the signal when the flag ship passing the buoy. So that leaves you. Come on, there's nothing to it. Give me a hand with this gear. Take it outside. -Don't worry, Mr. Moto. I'll get through. -Here they come. Down we go. You'll find the plunger box out here in some wreckage. Look for the anchor. You can't miss it. Now remember, don't make the contact until you get the signal from me. Three jerks on the line. Got it? -All right. -Turn left, 180 degrees. Radio fleet. Get in back. [SIRENS BLARING] -Fabian! [GUNSHOT] VENABLES: Right along here. Right in here. Keep coming. Come along. Oh, wait! She's got a pistol. -What-- what is all this? Oh, there you are, Mr. Moto. Who is this woman? -A very gallant lad who saved my life. Will you please see that she's looked after, General? -Certainly. Sergeant, take this lady inside, now. I suppose those explosions were part of your mare's nest? Wasn't it? -It was the other nest, General. -What? -The tiger. Fortunately, I was able to avert disaster. -Well, it's vitally important that we should know what county is behind this. Vitally important. -Oh, yes. Rather! It is, absolutely, sir! What? GENERAL: What is all this tom-foolery? -What the deuce? -Wait a minute. This may be the answer to our questions. Yes, indeed. See for yourself, General. -Well, what country is it? Tell me the name of the country. It will make a wonderful ending to my last chapter. -Don't talk, Mr. Moto. Or you might lose your job. GENERAL: Who said that? [MUSIC PLAYING]
