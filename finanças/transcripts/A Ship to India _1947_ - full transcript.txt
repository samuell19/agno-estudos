DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2017 A SHIP TO INDIA Based on a Play by MARTIN SÃ–DERHJELM Sally? Forgive me. You look just like a girl I know. I do? I've been away for seven years. When you come home with one person on your mind, you expect to run into her within five minutes. Sounds rather strange. - I'm not crazy, I assure you. - Really? Forgive me. That's all it was. Too bad. I think the rain stopped. - It's clearing up. - Shall we bike to the sea for a swim? - Just you and me. - We'll give the others the slip. Let's hurry! What's on this sailor's mind? Nothing tonight, thanks. Aren't you Johannes? Yes. Don't you recognize old Sofi? Of course! It's old Sofi! To think I didn't recognize you! I recognized you right away. - Because of my back, right? - Silly! Come have some coffee at home. It's just Selma and me. - I don't want to be a bother. - No bother at all. I'm done for the night, and Selma's rheumatism keeps her home. Imagine, at her young age! I always say, "Don't go out too early in the spring." How the boy has grown! And how handsome he looks in his uniform. So tanned and healthy. It's a joy to look at him. Everything's just the same here. And you two haven't changed either. Doesn't my back look straighter? It certainly does! It's quite remarkable. Seven years ago I had a hump. At least I thought so. Now I just look round-shouldered. - You can't even see it! It has to do with the soul. You don't know how right you are. So... where's that coffee? Coming right up! Good thing we bought all those biscuits! - Who's staying in there? - Just some girl. It's temporary. She's probably asleep. - We should probably keep it down. - You needn't worry. She's been ill for some time. - What's wrong with her? - I don't know. She says she's sick, but she looks fine to me. I suspect life's just too much for her. Know what this is? - No. Let me see. I wrote that when I was seven or eight. You still have it? Shall I read it to you? "Selma is so big and tall. She likes cleaning most of all. Tends to creatures big and small." "Lives with Sofi down the hall." "She's like a mother to us all." What's all this racket! I can't get any sleep. - Come have some coffee. - I don't want any! - Suit yourself. You're so nasty, Sofi. If you were in my shoes... - Come have some coffee. - I said no! Ignore her and she'll go back to bed. She seems out of sorts tonight. Who is that? You know her. - Sofi! - We might as well tell him. Yes, I know. Don't be upset. I'm not upset. That's just life. Some people are lucky. Some aren't. Right, Sofi? - Absolutely. That girl was always odd. She couldn't make up her mind. I loved her very much. We know you did. She was always waiting for some rich old codger, so she gave you the brush-off. She gave me a lot that I'll never forget. I think I'll go in and see her. I know it's silly and sentimental, but for all these years I've thought about her almost every day. I didn't recognize you at first. Then I did. I didn't think those biddies were stupid enough to say who I was. It's good to see you. You look in fine form. This thunderstorm's really awful... but it will clear the air a bit. It's still warm. I might go out for a bit. It's been quite a while. Seven or eight years. Are you doing all right? You look exactly the same. Your old man died last year, but you probably knew that. No, I didn't. He died of pneumonia. - And my mother? - That I don't know. Will you go see her? I can't. We sail in the morning. You're off again? And how are you? Me? A bit low at the moment, but otherwise terrific. And soon I'll be on top of the world. Poor thing. I don't need your pity! Just leave! Leaving so soon? That damned girl ruined our evening! She'd be better off dead! - It's not nice to talk like that! Stay a bit longer. I'll make more coffee. No, thanks. I'm going to walk around a bit. I'll see you some other evening. Good-bye. I must think back to that day seven years ago when it all began. Mother, Dad, and I were living on the salvage boat. We were salvaging a wreck. I must think back to that hot summer day, as I lay in the engine room listening to the men bad-mouth my dad. I must remember it to be free of it once and for all, to be free of everything that causes me so much pain... She's sunk on one side again! Damn that Captain Blom! Three days' work for nothing. All because that damn Captain Blom is out on the town drinking. He never used to do that. What are you doing? Having a good think. - Who are you writing to? - The State Liquor Authority. They've recalled my liquor ration book, and I'm writing to ask why. - Poor guy. - Damn that Captain Blom! Well, do something about it! - If he's not here tomorrow, I'm off. - You wouldn't dare. How much margin should I leave on the sides when I write to them? If this keeps up, we'll get no money! The whole job's falling apart! Why don't we talk to Johannes? He gets bashed on the hump if he opens his mouth. We could at least try. Johannes? What's wrong? - Nothing. - Was someone mean to you? - Why? You'll be off in a few weeks after you arrange for your passport on Tuesday. I'll never get to leave. Of course you will! The old man will stop me somehow. I'll help you. - You? - Don't think I can? - You're too nice to him. - He's not as bad as you think. You defend him, when you get the worst of it! We've been married 25 years. That's a long time. He doesn't care about you or me or any of us. He'd leave us all if he could. You should hear how the men talk about him. - What do you want? - We were wondering... could we start salvaging the wreck without your old man? Otherwise we lose our pay, and both Pekka and myself have families to support. We could start right away, without the captain. You could be our commander and be in charge. The old man will hit the roof. If we stick together, there's nothing he can do. He has all the keys. We can break the lock and get all the gear. All right. Johannes! Think what you're doing. Oh, I am. The old man will get quite a surprise. He'll see that others can do the job just as well as him. What do you have there? That's nice! Suits you, huh? I'll take it. I'll pay you well for it. Another krona? Sure. Shut your damned trap! Come on, boys. Not another cent! You're going to shut up or my name isn't Alexander Blom! Prophets say of life that this Is life's undoubted greatest bliss Give sometimes and don't just always take! The truth of this I've learned it duly And what gal if not yours truly Wouldn't seize that bliss for her own sake? Come home, you handsome fellow Some night when you want a sweet If a fellow's nice and kind I'm sure that I would feel inclined To give him quite a treat For I can never say no Come home, you handsome fellow Some night when you want a sweet Because the boys ahead of you Might come inside before you do And ask me for a treat And I can never tell them no What? I'm watching the show! Leave me alone! What the hell! Are you crazy? If you have something to tell me, find some other time! You're making quite a racket. Isn't that the truth! - You'd better beat it. - Why? The cops will be here soon. They're always spoiling the fun. - You're crazy. - That's quite possible. - Come along. - I'm coming! - What's wrong? - I'm not sure. It's my eyes. - Your eyes? - This happens sometimes. Maybe from one of those punches. Maybe. Come back soon? Yes, and I won't take so long this time. Sally! - What do you want? - Just came to see how you were. I'm fine. - Did you see a doctor? - Yes, I did. - Was everything all right? - Yes. Everything was fine. Is it serious? Something about a nerve, and some fluid that's drying up. Then everything will go dark. - When will that happen? - He couldn't say. But I think it'll be soon. What will you do? Going blind isn't the worst thing in the world. No, it isn't. To never have seen anything is far worse. What do you mean? I'm going to salvage that boat... and then we'll leave this place... you and me, and go far away. - I'd like that. - Are you sure? If you've ever seen the manager of the variety show... then you know I am. I want to show you something. This picture is from Tahiti. See the palm trees? This is from Ceylon, an island off India. There are palm trees there too. And this is dried shark skin. And look here. These are corals and seashells from islands in the Pacific. Pink and white coral, and seashells of every color and size. This one's light blue. This one changes color as you turn it in the light. Look at that! Listen. - It's murmuring. - That's right. That's the sea murmuring inside. I can listen to that seashell for hours at a time. Every night I put a shell up to my ear, and it's as if a voice whispers to me not to stay here, to set out to sea again. With every passing night, the voices around me... grow clearer and clearer. Keep it. For my very own? It will speak to you just as clearly. I know it will. You long for something else too. Yes, I long for something else. Ready here! Ready! - Ready! - He says we're ready. - Has she slipped down far? - Yes. I reckon it will be tough going. - Ready? - Test the pump before he dives. As long as she's not in a worse position. It was hard getting that chain under her last night. She's probably slipped back down. Move that other chain so it holds better. I got the valve working. Ready? It's strange hearing the pump running without Blom around. Is that right? Is that right? Well, it's not strange any longer, since that damn Captain Blom is here now. Isn't that right, Pekka? Am I here or not? Answer me! The captain is here. Say "that damn Captain Blom is here." That damn Captain Blom is here. Now, would Mr. Pekka be so kind as to turn off that pump? It's bothering me. Dad? What does the first mate want from a poor man like me no longer in command of his own vessel? She's sunk to the seabed for the third time! - What a shame. - Don't you see... - No shouting with visitors on board. - What? You gentlemen are to behave decently when there's a guest on board. This is my boy. My big boy. First mate on this tub. Aren't you going to greet the lady? Her name is Sally. Aren't you going to say hello? How do you do. They're not used to company here, especially young ladies. - Alexander says you're Johannes. - Alexander who? I'm the only Alexander on board, am I not? Is it fun being underwater and watching the fish swim back and forth? It's rude not to answer a lady's question. Is it or is it not fun being underwater and watching the fish swim back and forth? Yes, it's fun watching the fish swim back and forth. Hear that, Sally? He says it's fun. - This is Sally. - How do you do. Sally will help you with cooking and such. But I manage just fine. No, you don't. This will lighten your load. - I still don't understand. - I'll do my best. That's the spirit! You'll take Johannes's bunk. He'll move in with the men. What if I won't? You will. Their bunks are big enough for both you and your hump. Don't worry, Mom. His time will come. What time do you think it is? Around 3:00. - Can you handle that alone? - No problem. See you, then. - What are you up to? - Taking the 3:00 ferry into town. - To do what? - You know very well. You promised I could go into town today and arrange for my passport. - I don't recall that. - Ask Mom. She heard you. Alice, come in here. Didn't Dad promise I could go into town and get my passport today? Can't you go another day? It will be too late. We've been through all this. We can't spare you. We have to salvage that boat now. - Why the sudden hurry? - I have my reasons. - Like what? - None of your business! - Well, I'm catching the ferry. - Really? Interesting. - You did promise him... - Not that I recall. No one asked you. You can go. Wipe your face and get up on deck. No more arguing. - No! - Do as I say! You can't make me! This is my only chance. I won't let you spoil this opportunity! Spoil it? You spoil everything for me! One of these days I'll jump overboard. What are you going on about? You want to be a sailor. Or first mate. Maybe even captain of your own tub. You've trained as a navigator, naturally... and now you want to sail the seven seas. Before you've even learned to keep your trap shut... rule number one at sea. To learn discipline and do as you're told. Yet you think you'll be a first mate... maybe even captain. You sit there smirking. I could punch you! You'll pay for this. Alice, such a well-mannered boy you've raised. He knows how to speak to his father. Enough! What do you think would happen if he tried to punch me? I'm waiting, but nothing happens. Know what I think? I don't think he'd dare. He's too weak. Or maybe he's scared his father might punch him back. Our future captain! Keep calm, Johannes. My advice as well. Take ten minutes down here to dry your tears. Then get up on deck. Discussion closed. You bastard! I'll show you, you bastard! Isn't it enough to have to see you and your damn hump every day? Must I listen to your blathering too? You goddamned... I've been patient with you because I pity you, but no more! Drink. I said drink! No? Then I'll drink it myself. - You're drunk. - Yes, I am! You're beautiful. Must be nice being so beautiful... because you know you are. You must find me revolting. - Why would I? Mom asked me once if I'd been with any girls, and I said I hadn't, because I'm quite particular. But if a hump-backed girl comes along, I'll go crazy. Sally, what are you really doing here? You've got a guy on land, right? A guy you make love to? - None of your business. I could be your guy. Would you like to sleep with me? Don't touch me! The beauty and the freak! Don't say that! Aren't I a freak? If you say no, you're lying. No one has a hump this big. Look at it! Then tell me if you'd sleep with me. Tell me I'm deformed! - Leave me alone. Tell me I'm deformed! Yes, you're deformed. Good. Now you're telling the truth. No! Leave me alone! Let me go! Let me go! - Are you sick? - No. Why? I thought you might be hungover... since you drank all my cognac. - Hans is helping me replace it. - Very nice of him. We'll say no more about it. Tomorrow will be good weather. Yesterday was good weather too. I wonder what the day after tomorrow will be like. Or next week. Or ten years from now. More for anyone? Your porridge is excellent, Alice. Yes, there's nothing wrong with our Alice. If we didn't have Alice... Then what? Nothing. Hans, you're always so talkative. No entertaining news this evening? - No. - I see. I have to think about certain things. What things, if I may ask? You, for example. Now that you've turned into such a lecher... this will be our last job together. Seems we've been thinking the same thing. Well, it's been nice! Good night. Remember when Johannes was little and we had only Hans helping us? We used a hand pump then, and Hans and I took turns at it. We brought up small craft and salvaged sunken goods. We had shabby equipment, and we were young. You remember? I pumped air down to your lungs so you could breathe as you wandered among the algae and rocks below. It was like I gave you life every time I pushed that lever. You remember? Those were good times. I can't help the way things are, Alice. And what's left for me? Twenty-five years... I don't have the strength anymore. I'm getting old, you know. I've tried, Alice. I swear I have. I'm not sure what you mean. I had no life before I met you. My love for you gave me the strength to carry on through the rough times. Your joy was my joy. I know that. I don't think one should try and change things. Or turn back. You just get lost. I don't intend to turn back. Can you find your way through the 25 years behind us... the days and nights, hours, minutes, and seconds... without getting lost? My life isn't over yet. Not yet. We're drifting further and further apart. My words don't reach you, and yours don't reach me. I have something to tell you. I'm going blind. Yes, I know. In a month, maybe two. A year at the most. Yes, I know. I'm going away and taking Sally with me. I intend to get everything life has never given me. You understand? Yes. Sally is a big part of everything I never had. You understand? Yes. So she and I are leaving here and going far, far away. You have to try to understand. And after that? After that? Nothing. You don't intend to come back? No. What's to become of me? You'll have a pension from the company and a cottage on land. That's always been your dream. My dream was to live there with you. You have to try to understand. Listen... that business last night... can we forget all about that? - I understood you. - Really? Yes, really. That's good. - You have your own problems. - Yes, I do. Look! Africa, America, India. You don't know what Africa looks like, approaching it slowly at night after months at sea. Sailing at night into a harbor glimmering with lights... the water dark and calm. And the air has a strange scent, very different from here. A kind of wild smell... that makes you wild too. How do you know all that? I've read about it in books. A Negro stands on the quay staring at you, eyes white under the streetlamps. Once on land, you hear languages you don't understand. People are black instead of white. Everything is new and different. It's funny. I've never heard you say so much at once. Shall we row to shore? I'll show you something fun. I come up here sometimes. - You sit up here all alone? - No. Who do you bring? I imagine someone I can talk to about my thoughts and dreams. What do you want most of all? To be rid of my hump. It's not a hump. You're just a bit round-shouldered. - I've been wondering about something. - What? - Your eyes. They look so sad. - Do they? It makes me wonder why you're sad. I don't know. Maybe I was born to be unhappy and make others unhappy. You mustn't ever give up. I never will. I know you won't. But I'm lazy and apathetic. You're not like that at all. I'm going to get free of everything that's holding me back. You just have to be determined as hell. I'm never determined as hell about anything. Are you in love with my dad? Why do you ask? I'm thinking of my mom. It can't be much fun for her. You wish I weren't here. I like having you here, but Mom's getting sadder and sadder. You needn't worry. I don't love your father. Is there someone else? No, no one. What did you do before the variety show? I was poor. So poor I decided to do something about it, in my own way. Which way was that? What do you think? - Can that get you anywhere? - Sure can, but it hardens you. You stop caring about others. I still believe there's something good and true. You do, do you? I guess we'll see. Look at me. I'm pretty good-looking. But I have nothing, am nothing, am capable of nothing. Imagine you're some big shot who sees me and thinks... "I want that girl." You walk up and ask me, "What would it cost me, miss?" And I answer, "A nice, well-paid job with little to do. And a fur coat, and a little dog for my living room floor." - That's disgusting! - You can talk! You're not that man! I consider such an agreement decent and honorable, and it suits my style. You think I'm no better than a common whore! Admit it! You wanted to slap me. Go ahead! Why care what I think? But I do care about what you think. You're the first person to be nice to me without wanting anything in return. If I could fall in love with someone... I'd fall in love with you. You don't know what you're saying. You're crazy. Yes, I'm completely crazy! Can't a person be crazy sometimes? I've always been alone. No one has ever cared about me. A person shouldn't be alone. We all need someone to take care of. We all need someone to love. Or else we might as well be dead. Time for some lunch. I'm hungry as a wolf. Come on, Sally. Well, I'll be damned! Can't you hear me? It's me, Alice. Please open the door. You can't just sit in there. You have to eat. I've brought you some lunch. Please open the door! - What's wrong? - I can't take it anymore. - It will pass. - It's all hopeless. - Johannes was right to hit him back. - It's never right to hit back. Imagine if I'd hit back every time I was hit. Maybe you wouldn't be so worn down. You must accept the way things are. No! One shouldn't just accept things... like an animal that's whipped until it dies. One should stand up for one's rights. It was different before. Before? When Blom and I were young. Then Johannes came along. - And things changed? - Not for me. - For Blom? - Yes. He couldn't stand the boy, the fact he was a cripple. I had to keep him out of sight so that his father wouldn't kick him like a dog. Sometimes when he was drunk, he'd set Johannes on his lap and cry and moan over him. You couldn't escape it. It was contagious. Eventually his hump was all I saw too. He was always ill as a boy. I wanted him to die. Then he started tormenting me. He turned mean and malicious. We'd leave him alone, and he'd keep quietly to himself. Sometimes he'd run off and hide for days on end. When we found him, Blom would thrash him with his belt. He'd lie there like he was dead. But he never cried out, like other children would have done. He'd just go stiff and grind his teeth. I'm proud that Johannes hit back today! - Do you love Johannes? - No. - You don't care about anyone. - No, I don't! Maybe I'd like to... but I don't dare. I don't want to end up like you. - We've had a decent life. - How can you say that? - Better than many others. - And you accept my being here? - You're not the first. It will pass... when he goes blind. - You're looking forward to it! - Yes, I am! I'll take care of him. We'll have our pension and our cottage. It's all I think about, every moment. How awful! Is it? - I'm leaving and taking Johannes. - What good will that do? If he stays here another minute, something terrible will happen! I'm going in to talk to Blom. He won't let you in. Yes, he will. Open up! Set the food on the table. - It's done. - Anything else? I'm leaving tomorrow and taking Johannes with me. - What have you two been up to? - Don't try that with me! Some thanks for getting you out of that theater! - Don't be ridiculous. - Leave, then! But Johannes stays. I decide around here. - Did you decide he'd hit you? - He'll pay for that! No, you'll pay for what you've done to him and Alice and everyone else. You're awful sure of yourself! I could tell Johannes about you. Don't waste your breath. I already have. Sally, don't go. Something else you wanted? Remember when I gave you that seashell? Things were different then. I didn't know you then. Now I do. You know nothing about me. You don't know anything. You know what it's like to go blind? To wake up in the morning and know it's one day closer? To be scared to close your eyes or fall asleep? To see things now... knowing you may not see them tomorrow or even sooner. To see everything without having seen anything. Did you know this is the only boat I've ever been on? Slaving away year after year, chained to this goddamned tub with Alice and Johannes! You know what that does to you? What it makes you long for? What it turns you into? I knew all those tales you told me weren't true. But I felt sorry for you. Everyone laughs at you. Think I don't know that? "Crazy old Blom." Well, I'll show those laughing bastards! They laugh behind my back but tremble when I look their way. You and Johannes and all the rest! - You can't hurt us! You and Johannes... You, whom I trusted more than anyone else. You can just go. - You can't hurt us. We're leaving. You can just go on sitting there. Sally... who was supposed to make everything right. You're a pathetic wretch! You're a pathetic wretch! You hear me? Answer me! Yes? Can't we work this out? No. I don't think you know me. I really don't think you do. She hangs around our necks like a curse. One of these days, a cable will break or a bolt will loosen, and she'll sink back down and take us with her. She'll settle in the mud and never come up again. What time is it? Ten to 12:00. Time you turned in. No, I can't sleep. I just lie awake for hours, listening to that damned ghost ship creak and groan. Have you seen how the water's corroding her? She's full of mud and slime, with seaweed clinging all over her. There's something eerie about her. There are probably a hundred thousand barnacles growing on her like boils. As if there were corpses inside. Old boats shouldn't be salvaged after they've rested in the depths for so long. Sometimes it has to be done. Well, that's not up to me. Johannes! Yes? What is it? - I need to talk to you. - What's wrong? - I'm frightened. - Why? - I'm frightened. - Of what? Everything's gone wrong. You mean with my old man? It's like we're waiting for something to happen... but I don't know what. It will pass. It's like this boat is speeding off into the dark on its own... but no one knows where it's going. I'm frightened. - Of running aground? - Perhaps. Or of sailing so far away that we never find our way back. Better to set out and not find your way back... than to never make a move. Let's take the dinghy from the stern. No one will notice. We can row into town in three hours. You hear me? Yes, I hear you. - Let's go before something happens. - Nothing will happen. The wreck must be salvaged. That's my responsibility. You see, I'm in charge here now. But I'm so frightened... It's me. I need to talk to you. Hans is sick. There's a lot to do. Come up and lend a hand! Who'll dive under the hull if Hans can't? Pekka or I will have to. - Pekka can't do it. - Then I'll go down. All right. I'll be up in a minute. - The third chain has slipped too. - I'll fix it. Let Pekka do that. You work the air pump. I'll handle the pump. Better let Bertil do it. Are you scared? Why would you think that? You never know. Work the pump, then. At least you'll be of some use. Alexander, it's been a while! How's Sally managing out there? Doing music hall acts for you? He was acting odd! Like something had happened. - To Sally perhaps? - What's that? The door's locked. - Where's the caretaker with the keys? - Caretaker! I can't get through the damned crowd! He's blocked the door. Stay back in case he's armed. Come along, Dad. We understand. You're not well. No one's angry with you anymore. Wait! Let me help you! I can manage. Did you know about this room? - Is there a window here? - You see that, do you? There's a bit of light. Shall we keep going? How is he? They say he'll pull through. Meaning? He'll probably be paralyzed. How awful! I wish I could feel the same. It's strange. Tomorrow it all starts again. The same old songs... the out-of-tune piano... the musty costumes. Everything smelling of rats and mold and poverty. But it was good of the manager to take me back. And I'm leaving. Yes... you're leaving. Damn, what a crowd tonight! You whistle for dogs, not for me. For dogs? Then why did you come? - You're not allowed back here. - Sally said I could... Sally can't grant those favors. Forgive me. Where can I wait for her? Outside. There'll be just one show tonight due to the poor house. You know Sally? - Well... - You know her well? - Is this an interrogation? I thought you might know why she was away. - No, I don't. - I see. In any case, she came back a few days ago. Unpredictable, isn't she? I really couldn't say. No, of course not. She's an attractive girl, and talented too. She'll go far, one way or another. She's the kind of girl who says, "Sir, look at me." When you ask what it would cost, she says... "A nice, well-paid job with little to do... a fur coat... maybe a car and a dog for my living room floor." From her point of view, that attitude is both sound and ethical. Don't you agree? Yes, it's both sound and ethical. I'm glad to have her back. I could do a lot for that girl. I've already done quite a bit. My little Sally. - What? You were adorable tonight. I know what you're thinking. I know what you want to say. But don't say anything. Don't think anything. Don't let all the seediness get to you. What you and I have isn't like that at all. I promise to take you away from all this as soon as I can. That's very sweet. But don't make promises you can't keep. No, I really do promise. I give you my word. I'll be waiting each and every day. I'll think about you every moment. It will be terribly hard. I won't be able to think seriously about anything else. It's strange. Tomorrow I'll get what I've wanted all these years... but I don't feel happy. - You will. - Think so? I know you will. You've gotten through so much and put it all behind you. You helped me. When you showed up, I was one big knot of rancor and hatred. It's nice to hear you say that... even though I know it's not true. Why are you crying? We promise to be faithful always and to love each other forever. We hold each other tight and feel both happiness and unhappiness. If only it could last. Of course it will last. Yes, for you. You're upright and clear-headed. But I'm afraid of tomorrow and the day after... and all the days to come. It feels like there's nothing that lasts. Neither sadness nor love... neither what's painful nor what's beautiful. Not for me. Don't say that. No... I don't want to scare you. At this moment I know I love you... and that's all that matters. Jeez! I thought it was a dead body! He's probably just drunk. I must have fallen asleep. What time is it? Around 4:00, I should think. I'm perfectly all right. Good morning to you, then. - Did I frighten you? - What? No. Did you think it was someone else? Don't look at me. - I've been sitting here a while. - You have some nerve! I want to talk to you about something. Listen, Sally. This is important. We have nothing to say to each other. Go away! Leave me alone! I have something important to say that's been on my mind. Then say it quickly and leave! You know why I came back at all? How would I know? You remember what we said that night before I left seven years ago? No. I promised to come take you away as soon as I could. I gave you my word. What of it? Here I am. Put this on and come along. Hurry. - I don't want to. - Why not? You said you'd been watching me, so you must realize it's impossible. I don't understand. - You're dumber than I thought. - Perhaps, but you're coming. I don't want to! Don't argue! Just go to hell! I don't want to, damn it! Yes, you do! You're just afraid. My life was fine. Why can't you just leave me alone? You remember when we first met? How you took my side and helped me? Why won't you just go when I ask you to? It's my turn to take care of you, and I can do that. I've missed you all these years. I care for you as much as ever. I want nothing to do with you! Just leave! - What's all this? - We're talking. I thought you were slaughtering the girl! - Shut the door. - You'll get us evicted! Shut the door! Sally, listen to me. We both saw what happened to my dad. That mustn't happen to you. You have to get out when things start closing in, not just shut yourself in and grow more and more afraid. You have to get through it, even if things seem hopeless. Or else it all grows up around you with no way through... and you end up leaping out a window. Listen to me, Sally! Open up, for Christ's sake! Don't be stupid! Open up! Let her stay in there and cry. Go away or I'll punch you! Open this door! - He's gone mad! - What is all this about? I'm not coming out! I'm staying in here until your boat sails with you on it. - I'll break the door down. - I'll jump out the window! There's no window in there. Sofi says there's no window. You see now that you can't get away? Suit yourself. I'm not worth having. You can't be the judge of that. I don't even know why I'm arguing. If you want me, you can have me. I'll leave when you tire of me. I promise. - Would you pack up her things? I must say, there's never a dull moment with you... THE END
