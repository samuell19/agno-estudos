Get in Sit down Tell me Brother... Everyone is accusing him as a 'criminal' They are accusing him for drug peddling I know him It's not his nature I'm puzzled Why did they kill such a good man in an encounter? You were a father figure to him Why was he killed? Go to your room and study I'm going to reveal a very big secret Ibrahim was killed in an encounter But the one who planned it... was Mohammed Rawther My boss Rawther... is the one who deals with every other unethical job Selling cheap goods in the pretext of imported materials Their current business is drug distribution We are accounting for this unethical job He is the client of... Ashok Saet who is addressed as 'Lala' He has contacts with big shots He is one among the few who finance the political parties From politicians... to labourers... Everybody gets paycheques from him Along with the seasonal perks He operates this business in a corporate model Edison is the unappointed CEO of this business "A girl like butterfly..." - Edison - Lala? Who is this actress? Lala... Thailand informed that he has credited to the Panama account He takes care of the accounting Rawther is their operational in-charge Since cops get their bribes... They seldom care Also the cops arrest people as per their advice Then they bail them out Hey! Come out You have been bailed out If the media buzzes about this... They pick up a scape-goat... Mostly it would be one who is tough to harness or a threat to them They will remove him from the threat list with the help of the cops At this juncture... One amongst our guys Was on duty of dispatching the drug to a rich client How much have you got? 5 grams 5 grams? It's of no use - Hey! - Hey! Moron! He has no regards for the money Excuse me... Where are you heading without giving us the stuff? Your man grabbed the whole thing Give us the stuff that you are supposed to sell to others I don't have Please give it - I'll give you more money - Everyone gives that You give me something else Something else? That means... Kiss me like him Hey, idiot Hey Jhansi... what are you doing? - What's this nonsense? - Jhansi Act upon your words Give it Take it See you, brother - What's this, Jhansi? - Relax, dear Just one kiss The kissing issue blew up into a major issue Hello - Kareem... - Yes, Edison Your drug delivery boys... Call Raja Hello, where are you? - At home, bro - Will call you back They are home Ask them to not to leave Henceforth I will take care of party deliveries She is a pro in kissing A great opportunity She was too good Luck chap you are We had no luck Brother... You want a kiss from minister's daughter? You are paid for the job, right? Why don't you get married and settle down? If you are too horny, you have hundreds of places in the city Why don't you quench your thirst over there? Why are you mixing up with the business? They are our source of business Do you think they will spare us, if we lust on their girl? Dispose the mongrel They presumed that it was the end of the story But the kissing issue... got leaked to the media A video clip of the daughter of Mr Manimaran who claim to be savior of culture and decorum showing her, drugged in a private party and kissing a guy is spread in the social media and has shocked the public Video of minister's daughter taking drugs in a party has been found We suspect the involvement of Lala and Rawther in this, what do you say? No comments The scape-goat for the cops that was sacrificed in the place of Raja... was Ibrahim What was the sin committed by my husband? He did no wrong Then why was he punished? It's because of something he possessed Possession? What's that? Something that he will own till his death His possession Me? Rawther's second son Hussain... fell in love with you So in the pretext of meeting Ibrahim... Hussain comes to meet you Ibrahim... Ibrahim... - Yes? - Is Ibrahim home? He had left for the office - Didn't he come? - I came to this locality on business... So I came to say 'Hi' Let Ibrahim know about my visit Brother... Come here... 2 lakh rupees Buy the stationeries for the kids No thanks It's earned from a sinful job Give me Rs10 earned honestly... Allah shall accept it - Move - Call me for any help Such a beauty she is I have no interest in other girls after seeing her - Have to feast on her - You mongrel... Aren't you ashamed? You are ogling at someone else's wife Filthy animals are known for such acts Start the engine Boss and Kareem rebuked him for his immoral desire As everyone fired on his acts... Hussain felt ashamed He cuts his hand Here, drink this I can't digest this It's not wrong to fall in love with our employee But he wants to woo someone's wife - I'll slay you - Kareem! Yes, Lala Within 2 days? - What's his problem? - Media is pressuring Minister is pressurizing to They want a men readied for encounter Raja might have been used I'm confused Shall we make him the scape-goat? Staring? Ibrahim! Let him make the scape-goat Come on, brother Let's go to the police station Let's complaint against them Let us get them penalized Will you give a testimony? Yes...of course I will If they weren't present I would have given the testimony Politicians... Officials... Criminals...

Brother is dead But yet they care only about the stuffs Hello Sir This looks like a gang war, sir They've had their revenge well planned We will have to enquire Lala and Rawther if we proceed further, sir Tamilvanan has ordered not to care much about it If it looks like a gang war, just monitor them closely and inform me Let them fight to death themselves Human rights will question us if we do something about it Okay, sir What is our purpose if they fight to death Start the vehicle We couldn't even see his face because of them We can't leave it Rawther We've a lot of work We have to move forward It's been around a week already Nothing will be done until finding who killed my brother I'll leave He's doesn't even know what to talk at a mourning house Stuff has to be picked up from Nellore tomorrow Rawther is upset after Kareem's death Hussain is totally useless Boxy called up What to do! We can't stop our work for others' loss I'll ask him to do it if it's okay with you One minute - Yes, Edison - Hello!

Aren't you aware that you're doing a immoral business? Your family is in danger because of you Do you know that? Who defines a good business? It's wrong to artificially prepare toddy in our place We will be nabbed But in Kerala the government sells toddy In Canada the government sends marijuana in post All drugs are legal in Netherland In most of the countries prostitution is a legal business But here it's disgusting and wrong The good and bad laws are subjective The requirement is the virtue I come from an agricultural family... I'm suffering here People buy drinking water for 50 rupees But they bargain our agricultural goods This is the condition here No good earning His wife eloped with another guy for luxurious life But he is now in his 45 as he wanted his marriage to get settled in his life Now he lost his appetite People providing money for unethical interests suck people's blood for money This isn't bad when compared to them Even though getting their salary they demand bribe This is better than them This money is not unethical than the robbery in the name of school fees We risk our lives for this money Money is everything here Anything seems good enough to earn money Then you can become a messiah of education a politician, a Philanthropist People who called them a criminal would call them with respect Greetings brother Hey Beemudu - Yes brother - Take it Brother!
