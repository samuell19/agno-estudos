Pop! Here, here... I'm over here, hurry! Where? Here! I'm over here! Where are you? Pop! - What happened? - My shoulder! Ow! Sorry. Your damn dog woke me up barking at the field. - Can you stand? - Yeah. What's gotten into them? What do you mean? Wait a second. "PREY" Shit! How long have you had that? What? This? It's nothing, just my eczema. Been itching a few days, no big deal. What makes you think it's eczema? Take off your shirt, Eric. Is that the tone of voice you used to convince Claire? Jesus! Come on! They're what? Chemical burns. How did I get them? The lab results will tell us. "New factory installed: Lemans Company" "Lemans is modernized!" How's Grandpa doing? He knows we're sleeping together. He made me feel guilty for taking you with me. You should clean that. That crap gets into everything. Don't want to tell them before we go? I don't want them to think it's why. But it is. What's your dad doing in your mom's car? Yes. Yes, but no! So what if she's in the hospital? I want him at the factory 8:00 a.m. Monday! Marie... Except for Claire, no one knows. Don't you worry. I won't let him find out who you really are. So? So I'll find a solution. You better...no choice! Dad! This concerns you too! Come on, Nathan's watching. Damn, why'd he bring her out here? She can't do anything. This is our land. Better not! I'm not letting it get away. Look at that. Must weigh at least 250 kilos. And he's all mine. So? What now? We'll go to the cabin, then head out from the lake. I'm warning you, we're doing this clean. You're not serious? For this thing? Nathan, fancy a little hunt before you head out to the big city? No, thanks. She's waiting for you. Oh, Christ! Never mind. Answer. No. Taken care of... What's in the file? I can't allow you to hunt. Think you can stop us? This land is ours. You'll screw up all the work I've done! The problem is this beast. If anyone finds out. Going out? With you. Stay at the factory, okay? This is my land. The factory pays for your land. Take it easy! We'll need help to catch this thing. I'm only asking for six months. You've been asking for that for four years. Don't get started! Shit! Anytime we do anything together, you fight. What about our baby? - I'm driving! - Not again! I don't know. - Stop it! - He always drives! With the work at the lab... I never crashed up a car. We could have another. Get your dog, David. I'm not putting up with that shit. Does he realize what he's asking? Does he have any idea what that means? I have as much right to go. He just found the deer. What can I say? Eric, your invitation still stand? Sure. What are you doing? Talk to him, if you won't. You can't! Know why I got a transfer? Your family, the formula your "empire" is built on. I've waited patiently... - Not this time! - Nathan... So which is it? You coming or not? Leave him alone, David. I'm happy you're coming, Nathan. Okay. Let's find the other ones. Got it? Not right now. Get outta there. What are you doing? You never could get it started. When it was working, I could. How long has it been? Not since your mother died. Nice job. You never miss an occasion. Move! Asshole! God damn it! Son of a bitch! God damn it! - Need a hand, Pop? - No, it's all right. Here, the guns look fine. Thanks, Pop. Pop, you really think that's gonna be enough to do the trick? Listen, it's not the weapon; it's the hunter. We leave the phones... won't be bothered by the factory. No, hold on to yours. But turn it off. Put this on. Then you won't get shot at. No camouflage? Not for boar. They go by smell. You're gonna need this too. You throw the bolt back in one motion to load. Not so easy for a lefty, huh? Pop. Talk to David. He thinks it's all his. Hey, David! You can't wait for me, you little prick? You okay? Yeah, yeah... You just concentrate on the trail. She tell you what's in the file? What? Claire... why she's not going? Same old story... Market pressure, competitors stirring the shit, she has six months to create a new formula. That's the way it works, the family honor at stake and all. I can't let her leave now. Nothing to do with you, it's just not the right time. She's pregnant. This morning, we were picking names. So? It's not like you couldn't have kids later on. Like I said, bad time. Bullshit! Business has never been better! So that's it? Things aren't as rosy as they seem? Your father know that? What did you tell him about the family affairs? How do you justify Claire... Stupid son of a bitch! You're in over your head. Say one word to my father... Fuck you! She's coming with me! Oh, yeah? Think she'd forgive you? Don't you get it? You're nothing compared to us. Don't believe me? Ask him. Go ahead. For now, we're enjoying this hunt, so keep your mouth shut! Is it this one? By the looks of it... maybe. He's not far off. Load up. Let's go. Get down! Sit! Quiet! Dutch, shhh! No way! He only listens to you. You have to flush him out. I tracked him! He's mine. We can't get a shot if we can't get near him. You two circle around. One on each side. Okay. Throw the bolt, throw the bolt, easy to say...shit! Shit! Nathan! Surround him! Pissing me off, the whole damn bunch... Really pissing me off. What are you doing? Shoot! Shoot, damn it! Should have brought more firepower. Shit. Why didn't you load? What's the point of coming? He's hit. Blood all over the place. Quiet, Dutch. Watch out! We'll have to smoke him out. Dutch! Fuck! Give me a hand! Come on! Jesus Christ. I can't believe it... God damn it, what's going on? Maybe he's dead. Would smell different. Oh, no! Pop, wait! Watch out! Not so close. Thing has two entrances. - Pop! - Eric, you okay? - Eric, you okay? - Never mind! Pop, talk to me. More firepower, huh? It's all right. At least I beat your record! - This isn't the one. - Oh, yeah? How's that? This one has all its teeth. Look. It's been attacked too. There are bite marks. There, there, and there. What? What's the problem? Nathan! Have a look. Are they... Tell me they're not the same burns. Rubbed against the tree till it bled. That doesn't mean much. It's to get rid of the parasites in the mud. The mud? You itch before or after a shower? After. David, hand me your knife. What are you doing? If it's the water, we'll know. Holy mackerel. Jesus! Where's that lake you mentioned? Hey, Nathan! If my burns are the same, that means I'm rotting inside? Depends. Depends on what? Been having stomach pains recently? Wait... it can be treated, right? Pop, gettin' dark. Raining too. Better to head back. Use your light if you're afraid of the dark. How many water towers are there like yours? Enough to supply all the drinking water. Give me your phone, Nathan. I'm calling Marie. She has to warn everyone. I'm guessing she already knows. That's the file? A secret health report? That's why Claire has to stay? We had no choice. "We"? Only a chemist could modify the formula. Claire is mixed up in this? It was to make it more competitive. "Competitive"? Christ, Nicolas! It's so damn toxic, your fertilizer. It's seeped into the water! What's your problem? You're the one profiting! We'd have lost everything. The farm, the factory, our land. What I inherited was shit! Nicolas, listen to me... No! The factory? The formula? Shit! If I hadn't worked my ass off, we'd have nothing! Is that how you convinced Claire to help you? I told you, we come before you. You don't mean shit. Stop it! Pop! Look at this! Hurry! Call Marie. Tell her all this, all your schemes...it's over. Oh, my God! It can't be! It can't be! She was pregnant and ate that shit. Oh, my God! She must have nursed for a while. The teats are still swollen. Where's the litter then? She still has traces of it in her muzzle. Oh, my God! - You okay, Eric? - Yeah, thanks. What the heck is that? What scared the deer. What? The rest of the pack. Shit! Guns ready! Turn that off! Pop! - What happened? - Kill it! Oh, my God! Nicolas! Nicolas! It's all right. Nicolas! Let go of me! - Let go of me, I said! - It's too late! Let go of me! The trees! Nicolas! Quick! Hurry! Hurry! I'm here! Give me your hand! David, I'm sorry! I panicked! I didn't mean to... Quit fucking around! Thought you were gonna get away, you shit? You're dead, you bastard! I'm gonna kill you! Stop! Point that at me? I'll kill you, bastard! David, stop! David, stop! God damn it, stop! I'm begging you, stop! David, stop! Stop, David! David, stop! David! Oh, shit! Is he... Dead. Broke his neck in the fall. Nathan, I'm so sorry. So sorry. That'll stop the bleeding. Your phone! It's in the pocket of my vest. I'm sure it's Claire. She called before. Shit! She can't come here. What are you doing? Claire and Marie been out here? Sure. We used to come when Claire was little. Why? What are you doing? Nathan! If they come, they'll die too. Nathan! They're coming! They're headed straight for you! Hi, you've reached Nathan Fabre. Leave a message. Leave a message. Still no answer. Get down! We're going to the cabin! Follow me! Quick! Think they gave up? Come on, hurry up! Use yours. Tell Claire before you call the cops. Call her. - A lighter! - Why? Give me a lighter! Call her now! I need a gun. Give me a gun! Give me a gun! Give me it! Call her now. - Hello? - Claire! Claire! Where are you? We've been calling! Wait! Where are you? You think we'd just sit here? It's Dad. We're at the gate. Don't! Go back! What's wrong? Turn around now! Right now! My God, what's going on? - Nicolas! - Listen to me. The animals have gone mad. David and Dad are dead. The fertilizer. It's in the water. The animals attacked us. Get out now! Watch the traps! Wait, Dad! Is Nathan all right? Do what I tell you! Don't tell a soul! Watch out! Nicolas! They didn't fall for it. They're too primitive to fall into a trap! What are you doing? Giving 'em some bait. Not now! Wait until we're out! Nathan, we're gonna die! I can't do it! I can't, damn it! Kick it, god damn it! Nathan, we're gonna die! Out! Get out! Drop it! Drop it. You counting on Marie to clean this up too? I won't need her to settle this. After what you've seen and my brother's death, you didn't think you'd live? No, not at all. After what I saw and David's death, you think I'd give you a loaded gun? What now? You gonna turn me over to the cops? You think Claire would forgive you? No. Claire, wait! Nathan! Claire. Claire! What the hell is going on? No time to talk! Get in the car! - What's happening? - Stay there! Where's Nicolas? Where is he? Where's my husband? He's dead. Mom! Claire. Don't! Whatever you do! Claire! Nathan. Claire. Claire. Nathan. Nathan. Nathan. Oh, shit! Wait. Don't move! Hang on... Nathan. Nathan! Nathan? Nathan. Nathan! Shit! Nathan. No! I'll bleed to death. Call an ambulance! You're bleeding so badly! Call an ambulance. No! It's okay... It's gonna be okay... Shit. It's gonna be all right. Shit. Emergency Medical Services... Your call will be answered... Hello? Is anyone there?
