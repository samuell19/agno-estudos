♪ [ Psychedelic music plays ] [ Indistinct yelling ] Take her to the playroom. [ Music continues ] [ Coughs ] Dee a good girl? Yep. Dee, are you a very good girl? [ Gasps ] All right. Junior, do that thing. [ Telephone ringing ] [ With Irish accent ] Good morning, and isn'’t it a little beauty? You have a nice voice. Who are you? I'’m Charles lightfoot. Captain h. Charles lightfoot. And this is the kavala boat basin. Now, what can I do for you? I want to speak to "big daddy" Sam moran, please. Okay. Hang on a minute. Hey, Sam! Sam! What? Phone call. Who is it? How do I know who it is?! Another one of your flamin'’ dames. Ha ha ha ha. Sam moran. Hello, big daddy. Dee? It'’s me...Dee in the sky. All red and pretty in the sky. Dee, now, listen to me, if you want me to, i'’ll come and get you. I'’ll come and pick you up. It'’s late. Little too late to be worried now. Pick me up? I'’m up already. I know where you are, too. Right to where you'’re at. Nowhere. [ Man talking ] Sam! Sam! Sam the man! [ Indistinct talking ] Man: The beach. Who was it? Dee. She'’s in trouble. She'’s a love. She'’s been talkin'’ on the phone. To whom? Sam moran. Tate, compatriot, in our lovely world of play, there is no such thing as trouble. No. Junior gave her too much. Then get the boat. Hey, kimo, if I was lookin'’ for a young girl, maybe a party, somethin'’ goin'’ on from last night, where would I look? Sure, one bugger your age still runnin'’ up the beach lookin'’ for wahines. It'’s Dee...May be trouble. She still burn it up with you? There'’s a big luau at rich banks'’ place last night. Supposed to be full with haoletourists though -- too square for her. I heard they had some kind of scene up there -- kryder'’s place, the one up diamond head. That'’s real upper valley sick time, though. That'’s the only ones I know. The other boys know anything? Ha ha. Sam, if I Don'’t know it, it ain'’t worth knowing. Kryder'’s place -- the place on the water? That'’s the one. Mahalo. Borrow the Jeep? Don'’t spoil the paintwork. [ Engine turns over ] Hey, brake her down, Sam! That'’s a Jeep, not a flamin'’ surfboard! Mr. Kryder, i'’m sorry. This man just forced his way -- shut the door, Robert. This issunday morning, sir. I Don'’t think I know you, and I can'’t imagine what you'’re doing in my home. I'’m Sam moran, and i'’m looking for a friend of mine. I should think hotel street would be a more likely location than my house, Mr. Moran. A girl named Dee Carol. What makes you think of all the places she might be in Honolulu that she'’s here? She was at a party. There'’s been no party here. Buster...i would just as soon start on you. That so? Well, if nothing will satisfy you but to look around, let'’s look around. Sunday morning cocoa breakfast -- a tradition in my family. I won'’t bother to introduce you. You won'’t be here that long. This is Mr. Moran. He stopped by to say hello. One of the most distasteful emotions a human being can experience is feeling silly. It makes US small children again, Don'’t you agree? Well, this, I think, ends the tour. Are you satisfied? Satisfied as dead. You do have a sense of the dramatic, Mr. Moran. [ Tires screech ] Get in! Get in! Sam, you filed a missing persons on Dee Carol four days ago? Get in. Coast guard radioed she'’d washed up just a few minutes ago -- drowned. Oh, my god. Sam, was this girl on the spike? What? I asked if she was on junk. She'’s got chicken tracks on both arms. That'’s the haolekid got herself full of "h" and ended up in a morgue. What'’s she to you? Sam, you leave this one to the cops. I want any names you got might possibly be connected with this kind of action. I Don'’t know anything for sure. Guess! Sam, you got any other information? Nothin'’ that works. I'’ll ask around. Kailua! I Don'’t like to lay this on you... But you owe me. I know. [ Sighs ] Yeah. Go take care of your customers. [ Children laughing ] [ Siren wails ] Okay...who? Uh! Oh. [ Sighs ] I didn'’t see '’em. You been followin'’ me. How come you didn'’t see '’em? Yeah, I been watchin'’ you. I Don'’t know what Dee Carol is to you, but you got to leave it alone. It'’s police business. Gil, I told you, whoever did that to Dee, i'’m gonna find out. I'’m gonna find who. Ah! [ Coughs ] Ah! Okay. Try and move it. Try and move it. I tell you what, I have a little time off. I'’ll drive you around, and we'’ll ask questions. Oh, hell, Gil, you know that won'’t work. Nobody talks to a cop. Nobody talks to housebreakers up at kryder'’s. That'’s a dumb thing. They got lots of juice up there. You got no way to prove anything. You'’re my good, old, long-time friend, but that'’s a damn dumb thing, Sam. Coconut wiley'’s? Gee, you stay out of it. Gil, i'’m gonna know the bastards who did that to Dee. She could'’ve fallen. She could'’ve walked in. There'’s no sign she was pushed. The autopsy said she drowned. And there'’s no evidence yet how she got full of that water. She was also full of heroin. Man, you'’re hooked yourself. On what, I Don'’t know. But i'’m gonna put you away for a while unless you stay out of it. Just stay out! Hey, lolo, where the hell do you think that girl came from? Dee Carol was my daughter, and i'’m in... All the way in. Well, pardon me if I watch, braddah. Got to know when to pick that dumb head of yours out of the alley again. [ Hawaiian music plays ] [ No audio ] [ Carnival music plays ] How'’s luck? Good here. Kind of bad for you, though, huh? It was no accident for Dee drown like that. Just like it wasn'’t no accident for them bust up your head like that. I Don'’t know. How do you know? Talk. Not enough talk to help you yet, but no sweat. I'’m listening real good all the time. Kimo... Mahalo. Hey, now, these guys play real rough. Now, you Don'’t get yourself busted up, huh? Want you to listen real good. Listen? Why you gotta ask? I'’m the best. I work the best for you. Sheeee! Sam moran. This is kunewa. Yeah, you said you'’d be watching. Sam, get the hell down to the basin. Your boat'’s on fire. [ Sirens wail ] Who is it? It'’s Charlie. Kunewa: He tried to take an extinguisher. That'’s when he heard the explosion. Looks like burnt lungs -- smoke inhalation. Charlie. Charlie, you damn fool. [ Panting ] Damn fool yourself. You--you wouldn'’t have tried to save it? Ha ha. You would have, Sam. If you'’d have been there. Well, I had -- I was there. Let me be. Let me be! Sam, what -- Charlie, we got to get you to a hospital! No. No, I won'’t. Let me off. Charlie, at least you gotta see a doctor! I ain'’t -- I ain'’t gonna die in no hospital. I know I -- I ain'’t gonna make it. But, Sam, get me on me boat. I want to go home to kona. Sam...mate...help me! All right, Charlie. All right. Put him and the oxygen on his boat. Move him...Now! Well, they burned my boat. Anybody see who it was? Not a sign. Nobody, Sam. Can you handle that? Can I -- I can handle anything. You get out of town. Call me at akamai Barnes -- kona. [ Siren wails ] Grab the tiller from you right now. Sam. Sam, you'’re gonna make them kids work for you. They'’re mean, and they'’re tough, but they'’re good. Willie and dino -- that skinny, little Hawaiian gully rat -- and pocho. Sam, that big broad'’s only 16. Make a free dive -- 85 feet, got a black belt -- judo and karate. Beautiful. [ Panting ] Well...what about your daughter? What about her? Ah, sorry, Sam. Okay, Charlie... Knock it off. Her mother, Mary -- she made me promise. I promised I wouldn'’t tell you. All right, Charlie, you did what you promised. When her time came, she went back to the village. She had the baby, she died. When did you find out it was Dee? About a year ago -- from a fat slob of a b-girl who ran one of those joints down on Smith street. Cute little kid came in there to audition for a job in that pigpen. And she picked on me to make a pass at her. The madam leaned over and whispered in my ear, "more better you Don'’t touch that kind." I looked at her. She said, "that'’s your daughter, haole." So, I went over to the kid, and I said, "i'’m Sam moran, and I guess we oughta talk." She looked up at me, and she said, "so, you'’resam moran?" And she spit right in my face. And after that, the relationship deteriorated. How do you feel? I'’m gonna die when I get home, but I feel pretty good. [ Gasps ] I'’d feel a lot better if you'’d stop cuttin'’ up the nets so you can get at the bad guys. But you ain'’t gonna do nothin'’ like that. Hell, no. Let her go! How do you feel? Oh, I feel great, but I could use Dr. Mack right now. I radioed. He'’s waiting on the beach with an ambulance. All right. Let'’s move him. Hit it hard! Charlie? You all right, Charlie? Charlie?! Charlie, are you all right?! Leave it alone! Who the hell are you? Sam moran. Who the hell are you? Kittibelle Clark, his sister. Take him to the ambulance. You better get your trucks off the blocks. You better come along. Somebody burned my boat. He tried to save it. I think his lungs are blistered. You look strong enough to help. Come on. Now, give me the rest of it. Your business? Anybody who gets off my boat with a fresh scar over one eye is my business. Yourboat? I own half of it. Charlie and I have been partners for a lot of years. He'’s been a good partner, even though he does barbecue the books once in a while. And I own this place. The refuge. Now youtalk. He wants to talk to you both. Make it snappy. Okay. Sam.... You, too, kittibelle. I'’m puttin'’ him in charge of the alika as captain till I get back. Why? Because he'’s a better sailor than I am, and you two deserve each other. That'’s why. Now, get me out of here. You better drive with me to town. I'’ll drop you off at akamai Barnes. He knows more about what to do about what than... Well, he'’ll know. How is he, kittibelle? Not good. Did Charlie have any unfinished business? Some. I'’ll handle it. Tell himabout it. Akamai. That woman ever say please? Yes, in a way. Charlie gonna make it? The last time I saw you, you were full of gorgeous women. Now you look like hell. I know all the reasons. Kunewa phoned me. Let'’s get a drink. [ Hawaiian music plays ] Knock it off! Knock it -- no! No! I told you last night... One negrito, double. Don'’t fool around with it. [ Hawaiian music plays ] Captain Sam! Aloha,sue. Jim, take care of this, will you, please? So? Charlie'’s gotta shape up. Kittibelle needs the money for that refuge of hers. She didn'’t always need the money for it. As soon as she breaks even with it, she takes on a couple of more alcoholics that need a drying out. You know, not more than half those guests up there pay their own way? Is she countin'’ on that boat to make up the deficit? She caters a luau now and again back there up in those black lava mountains. Sometimes that helps, but the boat takes up the slack. Kunewa says you'’re not convinced that Dee just walked into the surf and drowned. Do you think it was murder? Yeah, I think. Well, maybe the dent in your head is connected. And the burned boat. Now Charlie. Whatever the bloody connection is, there gotta be some lovely characters involved... And i'’m gonna have them. My phd in anthropology and my 11 years professorship in sociology never truly prepared me for the likes of you. Pathological, primeval, bloody Sam. How in hell you manage to live that rich, full life locked up in that jungle, destruction of body and soul, beats me. You'’re a fascinating cat, captain, with an infinite gift for collecting enemies. You know, if you just stay out of town, our friend kunewa is convinced he can wrap up the situation. And i'’m inclined to agree with him. Kunewa says the whole thing might break right here in kona. Akamai. Akamai! I just missed kittibelle at the refuge. Where is she? The hospital with Charlie. I was afraid of that. Is it serious? I'’m afraid so. Oh. I Don'’t know. Dr. Hyde. Sam. Sam the man. I declare. I simply refuse to faint. I'’ve given up being carried out of bars. Akamai, i'’ll be at the refuge. Call me if you need me. I knew if I waited around here long enough, i'’d find you. You found me. Yes. You split your head open... Again. [ Hawaiian music plays ] So it'’s gonna break right here in kona? The eminent and exquisite doctor of marine biology still has trouble about you. My god. Sam. I think you oughta stay here. But this minute, a lot more, I wish to hell you'’d go away. Charlie'’s make... Dead. We better talk. Want a drink? I spent 20 years of my life crawling into the bottle. Charlie pulled me out, inch by inch, and it wasn'’t easy. I loved Charlie... But he used to clip me. Yeah. Kittibelle. I'’m... I'’m really sorry. Mahalo. You got a ticket for drivin'’ boats? Any ocean, any time. Charlie left you his half of the alika. I Don'’t want it. Why not? Charlie paid $30,000 for that thing. That thingcost $30,000 in 1932. It'’s too small to be a cargo ship, it'’s too clumsy to fish with, and the passenger accommodations would discourage an arab camel driver. Charlie made a good livin'’ out of it. What Charlie told me, he made a livin'’ on that bucket in ways that would chill the heart of a Chinese assassin. I'’ve got eight guests in my place. It'’ll fall apart if that boat Don'’t support '’em. Yeah. Want you to... Support your place... Properly. There it is. Now you own it all! I can'’t take care of that tub myself! Buy yourself a skipper somewhere. Let him push it. Stay around long enough to train one of the boys to take it. Charlie had a house at the refuge. It goes with the deal. Akamai, will you tell her i'’ve got plans that Don'’t include ladies with tired boats?! Sam. Akamai! If I wanted a bag full of other people'’s troubles, i'’d go to the mainland! Sam, have you got one real lead? One? No! He asked me if he could have a real Hawaiian burial. He wanted you to take him. You and tiger cat. Tiger cat? Tiger cat Clark. My nephew. A real Hawaiian funeral? Well now, that'’s very nice of him, isn'’t it, junior? So, he'’s staying down there at least until tomorrow? Well now, I think we can find a witty way to prolong his stay even further. I'’d like to see Sam the man again. He'’d make such a marvelous main event at a luau. Reserve the refuge long house for a week. Yes, I think a luau would be fun. A full week, yes. I'’ll send Tate down to help you gather talent. Oh, we'’ll bring some of our very best from here, too. Don'’t worry, junior, and i'’ll fly down tomorrow. Goodbye. What are you foolin'’ with him for? He'’s broke, his boat'’s burned. He'’s out of it. Sam moran won'’t be out of it until he'’s dead. He'’s a special one, compatriot. We Don'’t get the chance to play with that kind very often. Ha ha ha. [ Ukulele music plays ] [ Men singing in Hawaiian ] [ Music and singing stop ] [ Engine stops ] [ Drum beats ] Charlie... You were a real blue-water sailor man... A laughing, lying pirate... Damn good man to drink with... And a friend. [ Speaking Hawaiian ] [ Horn blowing ] Aloha,charlie. All right, I wanna circle it. Willie, take the wheel. Pocho, help Earl. [ Engine turns over ] [ Ukulele music plays ] Woman: [ Screaming ] Ahhhhhh! Junior, you stop it right now, you stupid ox! Don'’t go that way! Stop it! Ahhhh! Ahhhh, stop it! Stop it! Ahhhh! Help! Ahhhhhh! Help!! Ahh! Ahoy, the whaler. This is thealika. We'’re having a little trouble. Can you give US a hand? Hey! I can'’t swim! Throw him a rope and tow him! Ahhh! You lousy apes! I'’ve had it! Ha ha ha! Hey, mim, come on back over here. We'’ll, uh, we'’ll take you to the luau. We can have plenty more fun over there. Go to hell! Hey, please take me on your boat. I tried to tell them there was some ceremony, but they wouldn'’t listen. Ooh. Here I am, and am I through with that party. Hey, listen, please take me aboard. My name is mim. Short for Miriam. Miriam lowry. We got good wind. Oh, boy, that team. Oh, i'’m tellin'’ you, I could'’ve handled him. I mean, alone, but not together. And boy, that seems to be the general idea. Wanna go back for your toothbrush? No. I have some money in Honolulu, and if you'’ll take me someplace happy, i'’ll send for it. Kailua kona, that'’s happy. Want your clothes? Hmm. I didn'’t bring much to the boat. They can have them. In kailua, there'’s a place run by akamai Barnes. He'’s over there on that aku boat. You go in his place, he'’s got a hatrack there. Put your hair ribbon on his hatrack, and he'’ll stake you till your money comes. You'’re nice, Mr... Sam moran. You think i'’m a tramp, captain? Hadn'’t thought about it yet. Kailua? Okay. Kailua. Kumu! Booby! All right, booby, there'’s your tinkertoy. Drop your teething ring and go home! Interesting specimen, captain. Stand by your lines. Thank you, Sam. That was just right. But it ain'’t right if you Don'’t take your half of the alika. Kittibelle, i'’ve got business in Honolulu. You'’ve got unfinished business here. That aku boat can pay good. Don'’t run out on me, Sam. Charlie used to say that if the money was right, you'’d transport pink giraffes and a load of Hungarian acrobats all they way from here to new Guinea. And if the engines quit, you'’d swim her there with a bowline in your teeth. No. I got just time to catch that 4:10 airplane. Kittibelle, goodbye. You got just time for second thoughts, Sam. That 4:10 Don'’t run to Honolulu anymore. You'’re stuck here till morning. Oh? You callin'’ me a liar? You think I cut that service just to keep your beautiful body here? Go check for yourself. If you were gonna take a grateful girl out to dinner, where would you take her? Akamai Barnes. Do, um, do you think akamai'’s credit might extend to a new--new dress? Bat your eyes at him. Ha ha. Okay. Yahoo! [ Light rock music plays ] Welcome, welcome, thrice welcome. Hee hee hee. Wow! This is quite a little rest home. That'’s quite a dress. Well, I hung up my hair ribbon like you told me to. And along came akamai. I batted my eyes at him. I need a Mai Tai. Willie! Oh mau mau, a hoka mau ooh! Mai Tai! Mai Tai! I heard you the first time. Mai Tai. Mai Tai. Mai Tai. Mmm. That'’s good. Liquor makes me lose control completely. Yay! Whoo! Yay! [ Music continues ] It'’s an Irish wake. Tailgate to a jazzman'’s funeral -- Hawaiian style. Ho'’olewa for Charlie lightfoot. Doris. Akamai! Hey, akamai! Hey! When did they cancel the 4:10 flight to Honolulu? Last month. Johnny got a charter? Everything'’s working. There won'’t be a plane in here till tomorrow morning at 7:30 A.M. "Everything'’s working." That'’s real akamai. Real smart. With any luck, you can get back to killing yourself tomorrow morning. Hey! Are they allhis? Probably. I'’ve seen him come in after a weeks'’ fishing, standing on the docks, sleepy as a lizard, with that planter'’s hat on the back his head. In two minutes, some gal will pat her boyfriend on the head and come over to Sam to play with the grown-ups. But you know all that. Oh, yes. I hope so. Doris: Akamai, telephone. Want a drink? Nope. Finally licked the demon rum, thanks to kittibelle and her band of dried-out angels at the refuge. I'’m not putting her down, mind you. If it wasn'’t for kittibelle lightfoot Clark, I wouldn'’t even keep trying. Mmm. Negrito. [ Imitating Sam ] No fool around. Ha ha ha. You know, I Don'’t want you to think i'’m bragging or anything, but I can actually sit here after all these years, right next to you, and not shake so much I spill your drink. So, take that, Mr. Cock-a-doodle-doo. Go flap your wings and crow. Hey. Good for you. Join the floor show. No, thanks. Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha! [ Laughing ] Come on! Don'’t waste your time. I Don'’t blend with your native collection any better than I did five years ago. And god knows, I tried then. I told you before, I am a vulgar specimen! And you are a sad, useless, nothing broad! Sheeee! The last time I saw that look on Sam'’s face, one of my customers was wearing his teeth for a lavaliere. What happened? Kittibelle just phoned. Says she has an order for a big luau. You know, preparations. Asked me to drive you over if you wanted to go. Yes, I would like to. No, I will not. Thank you. You'’ve got the biggest mouth and the loosest lip of anyone in the south pacific. Come here, stupid. What'’s buggin'’ him? I Don'’t know. Guess I better find out. No, i'’m not gonna tell you. If she wants you to know, she'’ll tell you herself. All i'’m tellin'’ you is that'’s a good girl, and she'’s hurting. So, you walk softly, mister. Ugh! Come on. Sure, boss. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha. Aw, Sam, Sam, Sam. [ Gasps ] I'’ve got a marvelous, new idea. Come on. Let'’s have a beach picnic. We can sit there and eat and drink things. You know, i'’ve got a big idea that tomorrow'’s gonna bring me a man-sized hangover. Oh, you are a lovely man. You'’re number-one, 10-karat, lovely man. Mmm. Sam...there'’s something I need to know. Shoot. Is there a Mrs. Moran around and about? Well, for a girl who plays it loose, you'’re talking pretty square. Okay. So I swing. But there'’s something i'’m trying to make my mind up about, so...so answer. No. There isn'’t... But there was. And for now, that'’s enough. Okay. Hmm. Maybe i'’ll see you later. Maybe. [ Gasps ] You'’re getting a little off-course, tramp. I want out... Now. And I want the captain at the luau... By tomorrow. Just the way I planned. Then I want him happy and relaxed with you by his side at a marvelous party. No. [ Crying ] No! Now, you know how much worse it can get than that. [ Hawaiian music plays ] How is it, kitti? Hi, red. How are you? Rome negrito. Put the bottle on the bar. You like drink soda? No, I like get drunk. Sheeee! Damn! Heh heh heh.

No, I -- it'’s so beautiful making love. With you...It'’s something... Something goes wrong. Well, words tore it the first time, you wanna try for two? Help, Sam. Help. You may be the same. I'’m notthe same. What do you think i'’ve been since you? It damn well hasn'’t been one big five-year marine biological survey. I'’ve loved a man since you. I married him. And then, one day, he killed himself. [ Crying ] I'’ve been trying, unsuccessfully, to kill myself ever since then. Oh, Sam. I'’ve waked up in drunk tanks choking on my own vomit.

Give those two to the cops, and let kunewa know. And what are you gonna be doing in the meantime? Goin'’ to a luau. Dino! Tiger. You and dino get the alika ready to move. [ Sighs ] Well, how do you get so lucky on your dates? Oh, god, Sam. I'’m sorry. I was supposed to bring you to that luau. That was the deal for 500 bucks. The things a girl has to do these days to make some bread. Honest, Sam, I thought it was some kind of practical joke. That--that kryder fellow -- he makes a career out of playing people through his sick party games. It -- it scares me to death. Don'’t go, Sam. Get on the boat. Go on! Well, there you have it. I have a great talent for destruction. Goes back a long way, and some of it'’s rubbed off on a lot of other people. Then Don'’t go this other round. No more games. Sometimes i'’m lucky at games. Sam. Is it really necessary, reallynecessary, that you march up on that beach and with your own two hands, take care of this fellow? I mean, can'’t you just turn him over to the authorities? No. No. I know that'’s not -- no!!! Whatever you'’re gonna say, no. Now, one time, let'’s you and me understand it. You Don'’t like me the way I am. Lady, that'’s a cryin'’ shame. But i'’m just about what you see. I'’m Sam moran. And what I am says I Don'’t like people that put lumps on my head, I Don'’t like people that burn my boat, I Don'’t like people pushin'’ junk on kids for fun, and most of all, I Don'’t like those kids dyin'’. What I am says I will look for those people as long as I am able. And when and if I find them, I will hurt them! Did it ever occur to you that you'’re probably the most self-centered, self-indulgent, self-destructive -- ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! [ Laughing ] Yeah! Yeah! [ Laughing ] Oh, Sam. Oh, yes, lord. Yes. Ha ha ha ha! You! You are kumu. You'’re pesky, but kumu. What does that mean? Kumu? Well, when they call a woman that? They? When a man says that to a woman, what does it mean? When isay that to a woman, it means I think she is some hunk of woman. Kumu. But pesky. Yes. Yeah. All right, look alive down there. Let'’s get the skiff in the water. Now. Come on, Hawaiian. Let'’s go get some white meat. [ Hula music plays ] Kittibelle: Why, Sam, you old sea scum! What are you doin'’ here? Hi. I was invited. Who invited you? I'’ll be damned. I thought you were comin'’ to talk sense about runnin'’ your half of the alika. By the way, where is she? She floundered on the way down. We pressed on regardless in the skiff. Don'’t worry. Crew'’s gonna salvage everything off it it can. Oh, come on, Sam. Well, anyway, you'’re here, and i'’ll do the talkin'’. We'’ll be partners yet. Kittibelle, what in hell is that? I ain'’t never catered a luau like thatbefore. Where is mine host kryder? God only knows. The last time I saw him, he was putting up those, uh, black-light projectors in the lava cave. He said it was for the luau -- night shift. Come on, kids. Melissa, comb your hair and get the salt off your face. Come on in, too, would you, Sam? Come on and talk to me. Wooooh! Ahhhhhh! You ever hear of a burial, captain? Or a good, fast car? How was your trip on the water, captain? Kryder: Captain Sam... I'’m going to make up for the chilly reception at my home in Honolulu. It'’s true you have a gift for headlong party crashing, but you'’re invited this time. Enjoy...sam. And we'’ll take you to the leader of the games. Man: Come on! Ugghhh! [ Man choking ] Kryder: Come on. No, no, no. You'’re going the wrong way, Sam. I must say, you have a marvelous-looking crew down there on the beach. And what a charming touch of strategy to bring them in from the rear. Parked thealika in some discreet little bay, and played surprise, surprise. Well, that was fun back there. Good thinking on all your parts. But we are the best in the game -- you and I. Don'’t you agree? Captain? You'’re lost, I believe. Lost in the witch'’s forest, like hansel without any crumbs. Wooooosh! Wooooosh! Am I satisfying your sense of the dramatic, Mr. Moran? Just follow the little green speakers. It'’s not possible that Sam moran is lost? What are you up to, Sam? You surely must know where I am. Oh, and Don'’t worry. You won'’t miss a thing. My luau won'’t really be exciting until sundown. The light show is only effective... After...dark. When was the light most effective on Dee? It was a party, Sam! I can'’t keep track of everyone who comes aboard for one of my parties!! You threw that kid'’s life away for a party?! Now, mother, come to me. Ah, ah, ah. [ Laughter ] I called kunewa. He'’ll fly down and take kryder and the packer boys in tow at kailua. [ Hula music plays ] I planned a luau, and damn it, we'’re gonna have a luau! Oh, it was a glorious fight, Sam, and you'’re still alive. How come? Ha ha! Yes, what happened? I was scared stiff you'’d massacred the lot of them. We'’d have to lock you up in jail for life. Don'’t tell me Sam moran is a changed man? Akamai. God forbid. Ha ha ha. [ Music continues ] [ Thunder crashes ] Hey!! [ Laughter ]
