Man: ♪ Baby ♪ Merry Christmas, baby ♪ Sure do treat me nice ♪ Merry Christmas, baby ♪ Sure do treat me nice ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ Buy me diamond rings for Christmas ♪ Hey, Chester. Come on, boy. Dad? Hey, Dad? Dad? Oh. Hey, Mom. Charlie, it's a long drive from Denver. You know he won't be back until late. This drain... I don't get it. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. So? So not turning over your report card right away is a bad sign. Oh! Here. I'm gonna go play hockey in the driveway. Hey, hey, hey! Running away... that's another bad sign. Whoo-hoo! You may have your father's looks, but you get your brains from me. Yes! Good work, Charlie! Wait till your dad sees this. Jack: Excuse me. Miss? Yes? Listen, my car broke down back here. I was wondering if I could borrow a couple of bucks till I get to a gas station. Money? I'm sorry. My husband is a musician. Really? Uh-huh. Is he any good? Well, yeah. Really? You know, I also left my lip balm in the car. So I'm out, and I think I'm feeling a little, uh... Chapped? Chapped, yeah. I was wondering if I could borrow some lip balm. I don't know if you're going to like what I got. Do you mind if I try? Mmm. You like it? You know, I can't tell. Let me just... I missed you. OK. That's for you. What's for me? I hope you brought me chocolates. Yes! He waited up as long as he could. Wow. Let's get him up. No. Don't get him up. Come on. Mm-mm. Come on. He's got the whole vacation to sleep. Honey. Hon... Charlie. Charlie. Dude. Charlie boy. Charlie boy. Dad? Get up, man. Oh, I was just resting my eyes. You were? Mm-hmm. Wow. Looked like you were sleeping. Didn't it look like that? You looked like you were asleep. Looked exactly like you were asleep. No. I was waiting up for you. OK. You can go back to sleep. I just wanted to say hi. Oh, I wanted to give you a weather update, too. It's snowing! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yes! Can I, Mom? Yeah. Yes! Can I, Mom? Yes. Aw, Dad, not another fathead. He's not a fathead. He's just really smart, so he needs a really big cranium for his brain. Now what? Um, nose. Come on. Nose. Nose. Dad! I said nose! I thought you said hose! Sorry. Ha ha ha! Scarf? Uh... Dad, give me your hat. Thank you. Yes! Perfect. How's he look? He looks like you. He does? Only a little cuter. Good one, Mom. Really? Really. Cuter than this? Aw, don't even... Aah! Ha ha! You are so dead! Ow! Right in the butt! Jack: You know what? You throw like a girl. Woman: Welcome home, Jack! Now go to sleep! Sorry, Mrs Wilkins! Hey, seriously, from this angle, she looks hot in that flannel nightgown. Aah! Shh! Shh! Hey, what, are you pulling an all-nighter? Get your skinny little butt in that bed. Nice work on that snowman today, dude. Thanks. Except you made his head way too big. I made the head too big? Yep. You put the bottom ball on the top ball. How you doing? Good. Yeah? How was Denver? Denver was cool. How are the guys? The guys are great. Everybody says hi to you. So? So? Is there anything you need to show me? Like? Like, you know, something in the shape of a present? You mean, from the gig? Yeah. Like maybe those plastic swords they stick through the olives and the onions? Yeah, like, for the martinis that Mom packs in my lunch. Mom is making you martinis for lunch? I'm up to two now, two a day. Good. Yep. I brought you this. Whoa. One of your harmonicas? Yep. That's one of my really old harmonicas. You sure you want me to have this? Absolutely I want you to have it. Where'd you get it? Where'd I get it? I got that from, uh... from an old famous blues player named Sonny Boy Wayne. Yeah. Right. I did. Sonny Boy Wayne. This cat was, 9 feet tall and could play, man. There was, a white light around him. He gave you this? He gave me this. He said, "Son, I want you to have this." "It's going to give you the power." Come on, Dad. Seriously, where'd you get it? You want to know where I got it? I got that... the morning you were born. Really? A little music store right across the street from the hospital. I walked out in a great mood, bought myself that harmonica, and I've never had a harmonica that played better than that one. It's my favorite one. Now it's yours. Thanks. You're welcome. Now go to sleep. Son, I want you to go to sleep now. That's awesome. See you in the morning. Hey, Dad? Yo? We're playing hockey tomorrow. Can you come? Yes, sir. Oh, wait a minute. Can't. We have to go into the studio tomorrow. You know, the game's not till 4.00, and it's against our arch rivals, the Devils. You're 11, and you already have arch rivals? Yeah. 4.00. Yeah. What am I thinking? I'm there. I'm there. Really? Definitely. Great. Hey, you know another thing about this harmonica? It has magic powers. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Right. I'm serious. When you play that, no matter where I am, I can hear it. Right. I'm telling you. Good night. Good night. Love you. Go to sleep. You looking for the power? Just testing it. Major label, huh? So what do you think of this Kaplan kid? I like him. He's smart. He really knows music. And you know what? He gets us. This guy really get us. Oh, good. Hey, how's things down at the bank? How's that new guy in the loan department? Oh, Glenn? He's a nice guy. He hit on me. Really? How about that? Guys don't even check for rings anymore. Relax. He's 63. I straightened him out. You straightened him out? What exactly does that mean? Stop it. No wonder he hit on you. Look at you. I don't wear this to the bank. You're barely wearing it here. Mmm. Sing me a smile. OK.

If you come down a bit at your end... No. You've come too far now. You see? You've gone too far there. Careful, Mac. You don't want to be on the wrong end of that left hook. Bye, baby. Bye. I'll be in the car, baby. In front of the goal! Shoots! All right! Ooh! A little wide, but nice shot. Who taught you that shot? Coach Gronic. Dicky Gronic? Dicky Gronic is your coach? Dicky Gronic can't play hockey. Dad, Sid Gronic. Oh, Sid Gronic is good. Sid Gronic is very good. He's really one of the best players we knew, if he could stay out of prison. Whoa! What was that? That's a little thing I like to call the J-shot. Come on. Teach me. All right. Come here. You're big enough to handle this now. Come on, Jack. We got to go. Be with you in one second. Hold on a minute, dude. The guy is coming down right here... defensive man. Bring it back on the toes and stick to the heel. Jack... Now, cut it loose! Nice shot. Very good. So... hold on. I still don't get it. I'll show you when I come back. I gotta learn it for the game today. I'll teach you when I come back. But, Dad, I want to... "Butt-Dad"? Did you just call me Butt-Dad? Is that the kind of thing Coach Gronic is teaching you guys? Butt-Dad? By the way, that would make you Butt-Boy. Bye. Bye, Butt-Family. Bye. See you in a little while. Love you guys. Bye. Bye. All right. Aw, man. Man: OK. First period is behind us. Forget about it. God knows I'm going to try. Look, I know you're just kids and we're really here to teach you about fair play and sportsmanship and all that crap, but I am so tired of looking up at that scoreboard and seeing that we're behind the Devils again and again and again! Lighten up, Dad. Sorry. History is made by winners... conquerors... barbarians! Now, I want you to go out there... and wipe the ice with their filthy butts! All right?! Play clean. Have a good game.

Why'd you go and do that, Jack? How many times have I told you? If you're not gonna be there, don't say you're gonna be there. You know how I knew you promised him? He kept looking at me in the stands. After about... I don't know... the 40th time, I realized he expected you there. Jack, I don't care if you get too busy or you flake out on me. I care but I chose it. I married you. I'll deal with it. He didn't choose this, Jack. One of these days, Charlie's gonna score his first goal, and you won't see it, like you never saw him with measles or when he jammed the Fig Newton's into the slide projector. Those things only happen once. Then they're gone. I... Don't, Jack. You said enough. Hey, buddy. Charlie: Hey. How'd you guys do? We got killed. 8-zip. Whew. Hey, Charlie... I'm really sorry I didn't make it. I'm really sorry, man. Hey, look... I got to talk to you about something. It's, uh... really important. OK. You know how you always wanted to be the next Wayne Gretzky? Well, I always had a dream, too... ever since I was about your age. I just... I just really wanted to be a great musician. I just wanted to be a real player. I wanted to be able to make a living doing what I love, and I really want to make a nice living for you and me and Mom. Well, see... that might be... kind of starting to happen. That's good, Dad. Yeah, it is good, and it's really, really good for you to have a dream. Tricky part here is sometimes if you're not careful, you can... I don't know... kind of turn into kind of a... Selfish jerk. All right. Yeah. So are all musicians really flaky? Uh... yeah... basically, I think. I mean, all the drummers. Ha ha! OK, here's an idea. Been thinking about this one for a while. You, me, Mom... we go to the cabin up at Pinetop. We have a real Christmas vacation. Just us... no phone, no TV, no band, nothing. What do you think? Really? Yes. Will you teach me the J-shot? I will teach you the J-shot. Hold on a second. No TV? Yeah, I know. I was thinking about that, too. Maybe a little TV. OK, cool. So... eight-oh. Ooh, yeow! How bad was it? I think Coach Gronic popped a vein. Let's see. Here, hon. Let me get that bag. I forgave you last night. Can you grab one of these? No. Hey, Dad. Hey, what do you got in there... a dead body? No, just, like, Game Boy, batteries, food, clothes... We're only going to be there for 3 days! Dad, we could get snowed in for months. You'll thank me. Grab the phone, will you? All right. Hello. Yeah, sure. Hold on a second. Hey, Dad, it's for you. John Kaplan? Here. I'll meet you in the car. I just got this, uh... kind of unbelievable phone call. Yeah? Yeah. The record company heard our tape. Went nuts. They love us. They're, like, 99% sure they want to sign us. Charlie: Yes! Oh, honey! Dad, this is awesome. That's great! Yeah, I think. What's the matter? Well, the head of Asylum has to see us. He's going to sign one. There's 3 other bands in the running. He'll sign us only if we go to Aspen for his party. When? Tomorrow. Christmas? Yeah. Jack, no. There's got to be another time that he can see you. There's no other time. This is it. Dad! Forget it. It's too hard because... No, no, no. Hold on. Hold on a second. Let's see if we can work this out, OK? How long do you have to play? I don't know. That's a good point. We could maybe play half-hour... 2, 3 tunes. You don't have to play a whole set. They'll tell what you sound like after a few songs, get outta there... Maybe I could borrow Mac's car, and I could drive back. That way I could be back by Christmas night, but I'm gonna miss Christmas day for sure, but... Here. Charlie, what's this? I gave this to you. I don't want it.
