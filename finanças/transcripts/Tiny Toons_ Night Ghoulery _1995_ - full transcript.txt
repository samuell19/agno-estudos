A cluster of curious canvases from Weirdsville. Each peculiar painting, a ticket to Strangeland. That would be one stop past Weirdsville. Case in point. The most gruesome, heart-stoppingly horrific image ever to be framed. It's my third grade school photo! Ahhh! But I digress. Here's something almost as frightening. A haunting helping of horror and household appliances we call 'the Tell-Tale Vacuum.' [lightning crackling] [eerie music] [Plucky] Difficult, it is to say, how the idea came upon me, but come upon me, it did. And once in my brain, it grew, until finally I was forced to act upon it. Inside this, the most horrible of dwellings. Feet. [Plucky] The pig were a friend to me. He had never slighted me or given me slight in the...slightestway. [Hamton] 'Feet.' [Plucky] It was not he who raised my ire and made my blood boil so.. Feet. [Plucky] It was his vacuum cleaner! Oh, the whining of that motor! Whenever it fell upon my ears, my blood ran cold! [dramatic music] [Plucky] And so, I decided my degrees.. Feet. [Plucky] ...to take the life of that vacuum and be rid of it forever. Ha! [Plucky] Mad, you say? Crazy, you say? Slightly imbalanced in the face of opposition you say, if you have the time? Hmm? Well, would a madman do this? bla-bla-blah [laughs] Don't answer that. Nevertheless, it was in the dead of night that my deed took place. In the very chamber where lying, not only my pig friend but the very item that vexed me so. [instrumental music] Never hath a man, or duck for that matter been more stealthful or sly in stalking his prey. [whimpering] thud [grunting] Eh! Phew! [intense music] [mumbling] Eh.. Bam! Fetch a bucket, Luke! Barn's on fire! [snoring] [Plucky] I quickly made forth to the object of my evil. But oddly as I approached it seemed peaceful, it seemed harmless. But then, it started. The sound, the sound! It quickly rekindled my devious intent. Yay, verily, forsooth, and ignax. The sound grew louder, louder, I say! And more loud! I calmly set about to carefully dismantle the hideous machine. [dramatic music] Boom! [panting] I am not proud of what I did.. Well, maybe a little. But the sound would trouble me no more. And my care in disposing of the remains was so meticulous so cunning, so...really really good that no one would ever detect what had been done. The perfect crime. The blissful quiet of the next evening was matched only by the calm I felt knowing that my secret was undetectable. - 'Plucky?' - Yes, oh my pig friend. Have you seen my vacuum cleaner? I can't find it anywhere. What a shame! I suggest you look high and low for and aft, hither and yonforth. You may think me mad for suggesting that he searched but so confident was I of my hiding place that I had nothing to fear! [eerie music] It's no use. I just can't find it. Well then, my friend let us sit and enjoy some meaningless chit-chat. I really looked everywhere for it. I don't know how I could lose a vacuum cleaner. [Plucky] I listened to my friend drone on, perfectly at ease. [Hamton] 'It couldn't have just gotten up and walked away.' 'That vacuum weighed 7.2 pounds.' 'And was one of the heavier ones that had a light in front.' 'Well, there was one that was heavier.' 'But it had an 8-watt bulb.' 'And mine had a 15-watt' 'which is odd, cause' you'd think the small bulb' 'would be lighter, and the whole machine would be lighter.' 'But nowadays they put all kinds of different handle types.' 'And even the power cords that could have a significant effect' 'on the weight on the machine.' 'Which they make up for with power-assist drives' 'and fancy names like Zoom-Vroom.' 'But there's nothing like pushing a big' 'heavy vacuum across some soiled shag' 'and hearing the little blinkety-blink of objects' 'going around the meter bar, and into the bag.' [Plucky] But ere long, I wished his monologue to end. There grew a ringing in my ears. My head ached. But still, my slyly friend speaketh. Heh-heh. And the ringing in my ears grew more persistent until I realized.. It were not in my ears. It were... the vacuum! Did he not hear it? Louder it grew. Louder and louder, until it was loudly loud! My pig friend chatted on. Was it possible he heard not? No no no! He heard! He suspected! He knew! And he was making a mockery of my horror! Oh! Anything was better than this punishment! Oh, what torture! Oh, what misery! Oh, what a feeling, Toyota! Villain! Stop! Stop! I admit it! I did it! I did it! [sobbing] I did it! [sobbing] Here! Here! It is the whirring of your hideous vacuum! [sobbing] You...you destroyed my vacuum? Yes, yes, I did it. [sobbing] I tore it limb from limb! Trounced, shredded, and sliced into slivery segments! [sobbing] - Can you ever forgive me? - Yes. But you'll have to replace it. Sure, sure. Heh, heh. Anything. Money won't be necessary. [Plucky groaning] - Are we done? - No. Now, it's time for the attachments!

Is it Mary Tyler Moore? Oh, Mr. Grant! Or maybe they're talking about Roger. Bond. James Bond. Or maybe they simply mean Dainty. With bread dipped in gravy!

But I really ought to catch up with the Acme Loo tour group. [howling] [laughs] They're gonna be so jealous when I tell em' about this place. - The Devil Dog! - The Devil Dog! [gibberish] [intense music] [all clamoring] Here. It won't attack, if it thinks you're an elk. [howling] [whimpering] Keep your wits, man! That's just what the Devil Dog wants! Now, listen, everyone, just wear your antlers. We're safe in here. For now, anyway. Excuse me. What are you people talking about? Evil, Missy. Pure evil. This town used to have 5000 people in it. A beautiful place it was. Everywhere you went, people would say "Hi" or "Hello" or "Keep your pig off my land!" A finer place never did exist. And then, ten years ago the first mournful howl of the Devil Dog was heard. Actually, it were Paddy that first heard it, and seen it. [gibberish] When we found him, he just kept saying the same word over and over again. - Kibbel! Kibbel! - Kibble, kibble, kibble! - Kibble! - No, no kibble. That's when the worst of it started. Every time we heard that horrible howl we knew someone was.. Well, not around anymore. 'Cause they was.. ...eaten by the Devil Dog! [howling] We'd be ate up as well. But Sean here discovered, quite by accident that the Devil Dog won't bother anyone who wears antlers. [howling] Can he get in here? Oh, he'll get in. He always gets in. It starts with a howl. Then a scratchin' at the door that gets so loud you can't stand it. Scratchin' and scratchin' and scratchin' and.. [howling] It's here! [screeching on door] [whimpering] [howling continues] bang [all screaming] woof [instrumental music] Hardy-har-har. That's the Devil Dog? Aye, be still as an elk, or he'll gobble you! - Kibble, kibble. - People, come on! Get a life and live it! Devil Dog. Sheesh. No! Don't take your antlers off. Puh-lease! [Babs] 'Oh, okay. I see what you mean now.'

[comical music] [dramatic music] [slurping] [engine revs] vroom [instrumental "Tiny Toon" theme] meep meep [instrumental music] And now, a study in stone. A portrait in panic as a lackluster lawyer meets his match in.. Let me guess. Could it be...Satan? Just introduce the cartoon! It is said, the great lawyer Daniel Webfoot was such a brilliant speaker. That he could win a case against the Devil himself. Me? I'll take my chances with Jacoby and Meyers. [blowing raspberry] [instrumental music] Make haste, friend Hamton. I hear our good neighbor Jabez Monty is in sorrowful need of my council. Are you ever gonna talk normal in this special, Plucky? Just stick to the script, Ham-bone! It's true, Daniel Webfoot. Look a-yonder! [laughing] [fire blazing] Hmmm. Either Monty sold his soul to the devil or Shannon Doherty's spending the night. It's midnight, neighbor Monty. - Time to go. - No! Please, Mr. Scratch. Spare me. Back, foul fiend! You shall not have this man! This American. Tell me, O Prince of Darkness what price can you put on a free American soul? Well, Monty sold his for ten million dollars. Bah! Kipple! A man is not mere chattle to be purchased by.. Te-te-te-te-ten, ten million? Ten million? A man's gotta eat. Say, Scratchy, as long as we're talking money here, um I know a good, slightly tarnished soul a steal at only 20 mill. I wouldn't give you 40 cents in recyclable cans. Fine! Then I'll see you in court! Bielsen, bub! As you wish. But Ichoose the jury. [thunder rumbles] [rumbling] [intense music] Behold! A jury made from the most vile scum to ever walk the colonies! 'Pirates, thieves, traitors..' '...network executives!' I still say The Chevy Chase Show could work. - You can take him right? - Ha! Of course. - Can I get paid in advance? - Oh. Gentlefiends of the jury my client, Jabez Monty, is a good man. - Ow! - 'Eh, a decent fellow.' - Hey! - Okay, so he's a total louse. But he's an American louse. And he loved this green free land of baseball, apple pie, and Rush Limbaugh. True, those are small things, but they are good things. Okay, Rush isn't so small, but you get the idea, hmmm? You were all men once. You loved this country, too. But were led astray by that man! 'That Demon from the pit, and his load of false promises! By what device, sir, do you claim ownership of my client's immortal soul? Huh? This contract, signed in blood! Uh-oh. How are you fixed for sunblock? No! 'I'll get you for this, you cheap shyster.' Cheap? Ha, wait till you get my bill. Whoops. - Ahhh! - Woah! [instrumental music] Hey, where are we? [gulps] This looks like-- That's right, Mr. Webfoot. Sooner or later, most lawyers wind up here. [evil laughter] Ah! [screaming] Ain't I a devil? [theme music] bam [groans] In our next story.. These grand old funny men find themselves surrounded by mad cap monsters and comical creatures in the classic.. "Hold That Duck." Everyone's a critic. [instrumental music] [eerie music] Who'd have thunk a cluck like you would ever inherit a mansion. Well, I guess my dear old Uncle Mortimer had a soft spot for me. Yeah, a soft spot in his head. Is that any way to talk to the new lord of the Horsehead manor. Ah, sit down, what's wrong with you? Excuse me, oh, villager? Aye? Ooh. - Eye. - Oh, now, stop it. When are we gonna get to Horsehead manor? We're there. [eerie music] Th-th-that's my house? No, that's the garage. That's your house!

And when is Fifi gonna get her own series? [screaming] [male narrator] "Night Of The Living Dull." Be afraid. Be very afraid. Hey, come back. I have "Willow" on tape. Squint your eyes and look closely. Yes, the intrinsic perplexity of this disorder demands an analysis The painting Frankenmyra. A myth, a legend? Or simply the horrible naked truth?

[Plucky] Plucky's log. Earth date October 31. Hampton and I, en route to our destination seem to have encountered an electrical storm. I have taken it upon myself to reassure and comfort the tender lad for he has not the bravery nor the courage of one such as I. [lightening crackling] Don't worry, Plucky. Flying is 70% safer than driving. 45% safer than sitting on a pile of scorpions and it's 5% safer than swallowing a tarantula. [trembling] You're so right, Hambones. This craft, this beautiful ship is our lady and we love her. Yes, well I'll just try to catch 40 winks. - Goodnight, Plucky. - Goodnight, Hampton. Sleep long and prosper. Uh.. Whatever. [snoring] Hampton is so right. To be scared would be foolish. Unmanly and illogical. Now is the time to relax unwind, to loosen up. To watch the little green gremlin on the wing destroy the number four engine. What? [chainsaw whirring] [dramatic music] There are no such things as gremlins. Now, I wouldn't say that. [instrumental music] [electricity crackles] Hampton, look. There's a g-g-g.. A g-gremlin eating the engine. Don't worry, Plucky. Gremlins don't eat much gas. They're a lot like pintos. I'm not talking about a cheap compact car. There's a little green man out there. [whimpering] Human, come, quickly. Help! [bell ringing] How may I help you? There's a little green man on the wing, look! But he was there, just a second ago. Do we need something to calm our little selves down? No, wait, I.. Beam me up, Scotty. Perhaps the human is right. I'll just calm down. Gotta get a grip on myself. There couldn't possibly be a gremlin out there. [intense music] Well, it ain't Montel Williams! [screams] But I.. He.. You.. wham wham wham Warp factor 3, Mr. Sulu. [humming] Hammy, please, in the name of Rottenberry, look, quick! Plucky, will you calm down? [instrumental music] Oh, fiddle-dee dee. Must stop him. Must save ship. [dramatic music] [gasps] [grunts] [screaming] [grunting] Excuse me, Mr. Duck. But do you have a light? Why, certainly, here you go, little fella. Thank you, kind sir. What a polite, young gremlin. What am I doing? [screaming] Goodbye, Mr. Duck. [instrumental music] [intense music] [instrumental music] Everyone's safe now, Plucky. I know, but I'm the only one who knows, why. Mm, well now, I wouldn't say that. [theme music]
