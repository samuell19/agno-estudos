For more information, visit aeon. legal, or talk to your time donation manager. Fifteen years? I was actually thinking more like three or maybe five. Look, Denys. This is just an offer. As you can see, the sum rises exponentially with more years. If you were to donate 15 years of your life, Aeon would pay you 700,000 euros. I mean, I just turned 18. I just think this is all a bit too much right now. Mr. Bondar, how long have you been waiting for your visa? Since Deny's was born? Let me be real with you for a second. You're probably not gonna live to see that happen. You're gonna die in this dump or get deported. So will Denys. But with 700,000 euros, you can get your whole family out of here, completely legally. That's enough capital for you all to get citizenship. Your father wants to open a shop, right? Uh, yeah. How long would you have to work for that? Fifteen years wouldn't be enough. I did it myself... ...when I was around your age. In my case, it was five years. That was enough to pay for university. If you want something better for you, for your family, then this is the ticket that will win the lottery for you. And what do I tell my girlfriend? Well, you marry her and get her the hell out of here. - Mm-hmm. - Here. Hey. I was just about to call you. Yeah, sure you were. Are you still on the field? You do know how important today is? Erika, Relax. I was at Denys Bondar's. He was about the throw away the opportunity of a lifetime. Max... Should I waste my time at some reception instead of taking care of my donors? Don't push it. You better hurry. Take it easy. There is nothing inside. Be quiet. - Would you look at him? - And in other news... I want one like that. Show me. Show me! Aeon, fuck yourself! Aeon, fuck yourself! Aeon, fuck yourself! Aeon, fuck yourself! Fuck you, asshole! MY TIME BELONGS TO ME Stay out of people's lives, asshole! Aeon, fuck yourself! Aeon, fuck yourself! Asshole! Turn around! There you are. I already sent it to you. Fifteen years! Quit bragging. You're still really late. This is where one researcher, in particular, stood out. With their latest optimization in DNA matching... Hey. ...Dr. Mortensen and his incredible team have made life that much easier for our donor scouts. And now a big round of applause for our next Aeonian of the Year. Donation manager extraordinaire, Max Toma! Congratulations, you bastard. Get your ass up there. 276 years brokered, and the quarter isn't even over yet. But what really speaks to Max's ability is his empathy and sincerity. Donors who were advised by Max always said they'd be willing to come back to Aeon a second time. Well done. And now, the woman we've all been waiting for. The incredible genius behind the chrono transfers, our CEO, Sophie Theissen. Hi! Max, we're all very, very proud of you. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart... died at age 35. What incomparable musical treasures were forever lost to us due to that untimely death? Let's imagine for a moment that he had lived to be 80, 120, or even 150 years old. Or how about Friedrich Schiller, Frida Kahlo, Nelson Mandela, Marie Curie. What more could they have achieved in a world where it's no longer age, and instead, the person who decides how long they'll contribute to society? Therefore, I'm happy to announce that, starting right now, we will include any current and future Nobel Prize winners in our database of recipients. As I stand before you today, the first 15 scientists have already received their donation. They're currently recuperating in our Berlin Chrono Clinic. Professor. They're ready for you now. There, our doctors and therapists are in the midst of preparing them for their new lives so that they can continue their groundbreaking research for many years to come. Together with Aeon, in the service of progress. Sponsored by the Lucy Theissen Foundation. Take it all in. It's perfectly normal to get emotional. I know it's hard to believe, but your body is now young again. I just don't know if I feel comfortable getting undressed in front of you anymore. Honey, I'm still the same person. Hello. Please take a seat. Well, I can see the rejuvenation was a success. We can turn back the clock, but we still can't make it stand still forever. And so, we'll keep researching until, finally, it won't be age and death in charge of us but the other way around. The final big step towards absolute freedom. And not just for the top 10,000 but for all people on this planet. How do you feel? I can walk again. It's incredible. He executed all 15 patients. He spared our nursing staff and the relatives. This was a targeted terrorist attack by the Adam Group. The police have already launched a massive manhunt. No success so far. Adam's already claimed responsibility for the attack. Time donations create a system that suspends the principle of equality. Those who make lifetime a commodity also make people a commodity. They reduce human beings to cattle. That's what the people did who had to die in Berlin today. Anyone who steals other people's time will be executed by us. Nobel Prize or not. Turn that off. We're gonna hunt them down and... How the hell could this happen? The guy got himself hired as a nurse months ago. I'm Nowak, your new head of operations in Berlin. His predecessor already cleared out his desk today. Sixteen years with the Berlin Police's counter-terrorism unit. First thing I'll do is run a background check on every German employee to make sure you don't have another mole around. I've already given the order for all employees worldwide. It might be helpful if, in the future, I had the authority to... In the future, I won't be involved. I have to prepare a statement. Well, this is very romantic, but my husband will be home any minute. Really? I hear he's the jealous type. - Extremely unattractive men often are. - Mm. - I compensate in other ways. - I already read the news. Employee of the Year. Maybe we can afford a place by the lake soon. Are you crazy? We haven't even paid off this apartment yet. So what? Just call that bank consultant that loves you, and get us another loan. You said he has a crush on you, right? A little one. Honey, think about it. A house by the lake. This is our life. We shouldn't have to wait till we're retired to enjoy it. Our kids would love it too. Our kids, huh? You heard me. We should probably tackle that part first, don't you think? The food needs another seven minutes. You can do it. Try to be nice to him. I'm always nice. You guys are crazy! Elli! You really didn't have to do this, sweetie. The supermarket is on the way anyway, Mom. Are there really no shops left? First, they closed down all the shops. Next, they'll ban meat altogether. Best thing that could happen to your cholesterol. Yeah, yeah. He's smoking again, and he thinks I don't notice! Remember Rudi? Uh, colleague of mine. Slim and trim. Never smoked. No meat. Now? Dead. Heart attack in his early sixties. Great argument, Dad. Not everyone can have genes as good as yours. Now you say it's the genes. Then how come the poor keep dying earlier and earlier, and the rich keep getting younger and younger? Is that also thanks to genes? It's for the same reason the poor have a higher standard of living than they did ten years ago. Mm-hmm. And what if I wanna be 20 again to enjoy my high standard of living? Could you arrange that for me, Mr. Employee of the Year? Sure, if you can find a compatible donor. And what would that cost me? Oh, I forgot. It costs more than you can make in a lifetime. At least if you have an honest job. Animals are no longer slaughtered, but humans are sucked dry. Many who were "sucked dry" are better off today. Instead of living in the ghetto, they live in Neuk√∂lln or Prenzlauer Berg. They have jobs and families. I mean, if they have nothing left but their youth, you really wanna stop them from profiting off it? All right, that's enough. - Both of you. - Yeah, yeah. I'll shut up. Stefan! I don't agree. His entire life and career, he paid into his health insurance. And now he has to pay for his medication himself. You know how unhealthy your father's lifestyle has been. Now he has to face the consequences. Seriously? Why do you always end up taking his side? I'm on your side. Always. You know that. Well, it would be nice if you said that to your father sometimes. "Yeah, Dad, my husband's no saint, and Aeon isn't exactly Greenpeace." "But other managers screw over their donors all the time." "At least my husband makes sure that they're compensated fairly." "He also busts his ass every day to pay off a huge loan because his wife works in a community hospital for a minuscule salary." So, I'm supposed to tell him all that next time I see him? I better write that down, then. Or you could just say, "I love him despite him being a small cog in a capitalist system." I love him despite him being a small cog in the capitalist system. I love you too. I know. What is that? Shit. It's our building. Stop! You can't come through here. - Elli! - Go on! Get back! We live here. Shit. It's only stuff, okay? The insurance company will handle it. It's our home. Your apartment was completely destroyed. According to the last data transmitted by the fire detector, the fire wasn't caused by faulty wiring or anything like that. It was definitely an open flame. Probably a candle. Fuck. I'm sure I put out the candles before we left. Unfortunately, your insurance won't budge in this case. It's considered negligence. So they won't pay out anything. What are we gonna do? There's not a lot we can do. Your bank will demand the mortgage you owe. The entire sum. Uh, that's almost 2.5 million. How are we supposed to pay that? All our money was in the apartment. Unfortunately, they're going to have to claim your collateral. What collateral? You didn't tell him? What? Tell me what? I put up something else as collateral back then. I'm a match. You... you put up your lifetime? The bank advisor told me it was risk-free. Worse comes to worst, we could just sell the apartment. I don't believe this. How can anyone... And you never thought to tell me about this before? I wanted the apartment for us. For our family. No, we're gonna find a way to fix this. It's... I'm also a match. I already looked into that, Max. According to Aeon, there's no match for you in the database. - But I've donated before. - I know. But apparently, that recipient recently passed away. Elena is the only one who can still donate. Two and a half million. That's like... forty... forty years. There has to be something we can do. Unfortunately, I don't see any other way. Elena Toma? - You're gonna need to come with us. - She didn't do anything. Sir, step back, please. A writ of execution has been issued against you. We've reason to believe that you're planning to leave the country. We just went to see our lawyer. Just a precautionary measure. My colleague will escort you to our vehicle. What? Hey! Elli? We'll fix this, okay? We'll fix this. I'll find a way. Watch your head. Ms. Theissen? Uh. Remember? Max Toma? Donation Manager of the Year. Of course. How are you? I need a loan. Two and a half million. I know that's a lot of money, but I can work it off. The bank's trying to collect 40 years from my wife. We've tried everything we could to pay it off, but this, it's just too much. So your wife is having a donation legally enforced on her. Is that what you're saying? Yes, 40 years. To be honest, you're our last hope. Send me your documentation. I'll see what I can do for you. Okay? Our customers need to feel 100% safe with us. Otherwise, the whole business is at risk. We've already taken countermeasures. And as far as our business is concerned, we sell a product worldwide that's never been seen before, and the quarterly profits are reflecting that. And you've invested the entirety of those profits into research and other philanthropic projects. We're talking about lost dividends to the amount of 23 billion euros. And that's just last year. Research is what made this company what it is today. Yes, that may be true, but we've now perfected the procedure. "Perfected"? How the hell can we say we perfected it if donors and recipients still need to be DNA compatible? We're still wasting way too many valuable resources looking for suitable donors. That some people will never find. A minority with a rare genetic disposition. I mean, can we really justify spending this much on questionable research that only covers a tiny niche? And one more thing... The shareholders are worried that because of this, Ms. Theissen, you might be a bit too biased. As opposed to you? You ready? She promised. Sophie Theissen promised she'd get back to me. Max. I've been trying to reach her office every day for weeks. Every day. Welcome to Aeon. Luna Ackermann. We're here to see a patient. Elena Toma. I'm her lawyer. Her donation is in two hours. I can't let her see any visitors until after the procedure. Look, I work over at headquarters. I just wanna see my wife. For enforced donations, you have to wait until after the operation. You're sucking 40 years from her, and I'm not even allowed to see her? Regulations. I'm sorry. "Regulations"? You asshole! Her life will be over after you're done with her! - I wanna see her now! - Max. This is getting us nowhere. Luna, that's all I ever hear from you. Why are you even here, huh? Fuck! - Max. Max! - Hey, stop! I said stop! Elena? Elena! Oh! Elena! Elena! Let go of me! I just wanna see my wife! Let go of me! You need to calm down right now... ...or else my colleague is going to hurt you. Hey, please! This isn't necessary. The man just wanted to see his wife. That's all. Please let him go. He'll be calm. Why were we finally able to stop the climate crisis? Because the top 5% decided to invest into green technology. Because the prospect of presumably living in this world for, hopefully, much longer, completely changed their perspective on the climate. When we change our perspective of this world... ...we can also change the world as a result of it. You, Ms. Elena Toma, hereafter referred to as "the debtor," have had an attachment of assets issued against you. The seizure shall be levied against the time assets of the debtor. As decided by the court, the amount shall be 38 years. In accordance with section 863 of the Civil Procedure Code, after the procedure is performed by Aeon Inc., the seized amount shall be immediately paid out to the creditors. The People's Republic of China has long been advocating for an international ban on time donations. What do you have to say about that? It's innovation. You can't stop it. Uh, but what you can do is enforce the responsible handling of innovative technologies. And that's where I think this resistance is coming from. No. No! No! Stop! You can't do this! Let me go! Help me! Help! Help! You have to help me. Please. Please help! You have to help me, please! We can't afford anything better right now. It's already starting. Hey. It's okay. It's all right. "Got some good news from the very top. Erika." Unless I'm somehow mistaken, this comes from the desk of Sophie Theissen herself. I've been working here ten years, and I doubt she knows my name. So, what does it say? Congratulations, you've been promoted. Senior donation manager. - You'll have your own team and everything. - Wait, that's it? What do you mean? You're making more than me now. Almost a thousand more a month and a 35,000 euro bonus on top of that. You think I wanna spend one more millisecond working here? - Hey. Everything set up for the meeting? - Hi. - Hey, how are you? - Hi. Good to see you. Ms. Theissen? - Ms. Theissen is busy right now. - She knows me. She... Hey. You promised you'd help me. If you care about your future here at all, you'll turn around and walk away now. Elli? Best I could do. I love you so much. We'll get through this. I can't do this. Look at us. This is crazy. I love you. - Regardless... - Of how old I am? What is this anyway? Pity? What? No. Then what? You feel guilty for me? Come on now. Your life goes on. I paid the price, not you. I didn't ask for this. Leave me alone. Leave me alone! - Elli. - Just leave me alone. Rough day? Need a pick-me-up? I'll give you a really good deal. Fuck off. You don't have to be such a dick about it. Asshole. Fortunately, we were able to stop the bleeding. But we're still waiting for the results of the hematogram. Why would you withdraw 40 years at once? That's incredibly irresponsible and reckless. You should've stayed at the transfer clinic a few more days. Especially after a procedure that serious and given her condition. What condition? Elena had a miscarriage. It's unfortunately very common with time donors. You were pregnant? There's just no point. You belong with me, no matter how old your body is. Max, this isn't just about some gray hair or wrinkles. We wanted to watch our kids grow up together. They'd have kids of their own. We'd play with our grandchildren one day. And we wanted to grow old together. Both of us. But now I won't be able to do any of that with you. You still have your whole life ahead of you. I'm here, Elli. You don't have to come in. It can be reversed. I know who the recipient was, and I'll find a way to make them reverse it. How? They didn't break any laws. That's how it works, isn't it? Your stupid system. Fuck the system. Give me those and two of the other ones. No problem. Mommy's got everything. Thanks. You really shouldn't do that. Stunts your growth. Ha ha. What do you want, asshole? Where did you get it done? You're not fooling me with that baby face. Aeon didn't do it. Relax. I'm not gonna report you. I just want your contact. We have received the 30,000 euros. Dr. Berg will expect you in one week's time. As soon as you've crossed the border into Lithuania, you'll contact him via an unregistered burner phone. You will then be given the coordinates to the clinic. Those will be valid for exactly six hours. If you don't show up, our agreement is void. Ever since the attack that claimed the lives of several Nobel Prize laureates at an Aeon clinic in Berlin a few weeks ago, Lilith, the leader of the Adam Group, has been on the very top of every international most wanted list. As of now, we have no information on her whereabouts. However, one of our reporters was able to make contact with her, and she's agreed to be patched in from an undisclosed location. You've claimed that your acts of terrorism are simply a continuation of dedicated lobbying. Are you not simply trying to justify these needless acts of violence? We are a wake-up call. If more people would take a stand against grave injustice, groups like Adam would not be necessary. And thankfully, more people are joining us every day. Convoy on standby. Sophie Theissen is now leaving the building. In the United States, prison sentences can now be legally settled via a time donation. Is that not preferable to incarcerating an offender for years at the taxpayers' expense? What Aeon is trying to pass off to us here as a public service is actually a perverse privatization of the justice system. How do you think this will affect the future verdicts when de facto profits are to be made from long prison sentences? People well-versed in the bible associate your name, Lilith, as well as that of Adam, with the wrathful God of the Old Testament. Don't you think you're playing God? We kill every chrono recipient until this horrible practice is terminated. It's as simple as that. The number of time donations in the last year has more than doubled, despite all your terrorist activities and threats. And it hasn't stopped me either. Which is why you're also right on the top of our list. LAZARUS CEMETERY BERLIN Can you wait here, please? I wanna be alone. As you wish. Help me! Help me! Help! Probably a stroke. - Preexisting conditions? - Not in his file, at least. But his donation was only three months ago. It probably hasn't sunk in for him yet that he isn't 30 anymore. I'll take it from here. - Theater 2 has just become available. - You don't have to. Elli, you need to take it slow. Your shift is almost over anyway. Okay? Okay. Elli. Elli, we need to talk. - Oh, Max. - You have to come with me right now. - Listen to me. - What for? Let it go, please. You have to accept the situation. What if I've found a way? Just trust me. One last time. CAR SERVICE E-CONVERSION Here. Put this on. Come on. This is Sophie Theissen. The woman who stole 40 years from you. And now we're taking them back. I'll start here. Are you gonna do that side? - Thanks. I owe you one. - No worries. They think it was Adam? Well, that's pretty conclusive evidence. And you? What do you think? Usually, they just kill their targets. Kidnapping is new. What else they got? According to traffic surveillance, there was a car from Berlin Cars at the cemetery, around the back. Booked via a fake account that can't be traced back to anyone. However, that same account has been used before at Tempelhof Field. I went and checked our database. And guess who just happened to enter the field at that exact time using an Aeon ID. - Have his work phone traced. - I think we can skip past that. He's Employee of the Year. He's not stupid. But as long as you have a face, you can't hide forever. Well, you're not as stupid as you look. Have you lost your damn mind? It's the only way. No! This is crazy. I've got everything set, but we need to get out of Germany now. I packed you some clothes. You'll have to leave your phone here too. I'm not doing this. Absolutely not. Well, then what? Huh? We just live like this? You run yourself down as a doctor for a few more years until you drop dead? What are you going to do after the operation? Kill Theissen and run? We'll start over. Away from here, by the ocean. Max, we aren't kids anymore. If they catch us, it's not just my life that'll be over. Yours would be too. Yeah. I guess you shouldn't have blown me off, huh? You're right. Our lives are over either way. So, should I go to prison for this woman, or are you coming with me? Should we inform the local authorities? What for? Clear! - Clear! - Clear! Clear. Clear! Gonna check on the gallery. - All clear! - Okay. Moving down. Back to position one. We'll find them. You can save it with the platitudes. I've been at this longer than you. Shit! Your new life. You still surprise me sometimes. I surprise myself. Should work everywhere but airports. Erika? Seriously? ROSTOCK HARBOR If the police knew about this... This'll take some time. Coffee? Do you know the story of how Max Toma met his wife? He was assigned to her as a donation manager. But in the course of making the sale, they fell head over heels in love and got married. Hmm. How romantic. Yeah. Until their apartment suddenly burns down, and they're drowning in debt. I know we're not dealing with criminal masterminds here. These are two people in a desperate situation. Well, if you were Elena Toma, how do you think you'd feel? If your life was stolen from you and given to some billionaire because you forgot to blow out a candle. Nobody forced this woman to mortgage 38 years of her life on a luxury apartment. "Your time. Your chance. Your choice." They wouldn't be the first to fall for something like that. That suddenly gives them the right to kidnap someone? Take the law in their own hands? What about us? Illegal software, off-the-record operations. The richest woman in Europe gets to play by different rules? Our job is to keep the Theissens safe, not achieve world peace. If you have a problem with that, then what are you doing here? Touch√©. In the end, it's always about money. The coffee. The nice company. What about you? I started working as a bodyguard for Sophie Theissen over 30 years ago. I owe her a lot. Apparently, a lot more than first impressions would imply. Chronologically, I'm 64. Sophie Theissen needs people she can trust implicitly. And I guess the rejuvenation treatment is just an added perk. Well, at least now you can stop quietly sulking that your superior is younger than you. That's a load off my mind. Hey. I'd already resigned myself to the fact that my life was over. Our life. And then you come strolling back, telling me there's hope. Zoom in there. Well, fuck me. Fuck. We won't hurt... We won't kill you if you keep your mouth shut. Okay. You're already better than Daddy. - Very pretty. - Let's try it like this. - Emilia. Emilia, look. - Oh, you're so good. Don't go too far, okay? All passengers, please prepare passports and documentation. Mommy, Daddy! - Look at the pretty lights! - Uh-huh. All passengers, please... That's enough. Come back and finish your drawing. Come on, honey. Dear passengers, we will shortly arrive at Klaipƒóda, Lithuania. We ask all passengers with destination Klaipƒóda to return to their cars... Is that for us? Shit, I don't know. Who else would it be for? We still have the passports. Those won't help us if they check too closely. So, this is it, then? KLAIPƒñDA TRANSIT PORT LITHUANIA - Passport, please. - Yes. Yes, passport. What's in the back? Um, uh, a bathtub from Germany. And where are you going? I'm going to Vilnius. Okay, we'll check. Drive through. Your passport, please. Uh, how do I open this again? Push, then turn to the right. Help me! Help me! What's in here? What's inside? Bathtub, I think. You think? Tell him you're just the driver. I... I'm just a driver. Sir, I'm gonna need you to open the whole box. Sir, did you hear me? Everything okay here? He looks a little nervous. Why are you so nervous? All right, have a good trip. Hey. Just take a deep breath. Just smile and tell them you're not used to this. I'm just not used to this. Not used to what? Being threatened by a gun. How many times have I told you? Stop pointing that thing at people for no reason. We're sorry, sir. You're good to go. Okay. It's all right, Emilia. Everything'll be okay. Can we go now? Your phones. Phones! I'll just get the phone, okay? It's all right. I'm sorry. We had no choice. Yeah. We crossed the border. We should check on her. She's not doing well. We can't stop now. They'll call the police. We need to take side roads. And then? Wait for the doctor to contact us. What do you want from me? We're just gonna take back what's ours. Then we'll let you go. You can have whatever you want. My mother will pay it. Your mother? Sophie Theissen. You are Sophie Theissen. What? I'm... I'm Marie Theissen, her daughter. No. She's lying. My mother keeps me out of the public eye for reasons just like this. SOPHIE THEISSEN DAUGHTER Daughter. See? This is Theissen's daughter. She died of progeria over ten years ago. That was my older sister Lucy. Listen, my mother and I have always looked alike. - But after this fucking donation... - Shut up! Did she have any ID on her? Driver's license, anything? Yes, only it's in my purse. That was left at the cemetery, and she knows that. - Nice performance you put on though. - No. No. Please. Please! My mother will give you anything! Honest to god. She'll give you... Please! We gotta make sure it's her. How? Call Aeon to find out if we've actually got the right one? So her people can track us down? That's exactly what she wants us to do! Theissen would say anything to save herself! We're sticking to the plan. What is the plan? Why hasn't this Dr. Berg contacted us? What if it's a scam, and they just wanted the money? How long are you going to keep her in there? She's dehydrated and hypothermic. We need to find a warm place to hide. Why isn't anyone here? The tourism industry collapsed when the Baltic States left the European Union. We've got the hotel to ourselves. Theissen's used to it. Ha ha. Well, it sure beats that hotel you booked us that time in Tuscany. Ha ha. It really hurts. Thanks. - Watch what you're doing. - We don't have to be assholes about it. You're the one who sold 40 years to my mother, aren't you? Quit playing. You know better than anybody that it was enforced. Don't let her get to you. I'm against donations, too, you know. What happened to you happens to so many people. Look at the refugees that go missing from the camps outside the EU borders. Even children! They're sold by their own parents. Not to Aeon but to illegal Eastern Bloc clinics so that third-rate celebs and influencers can rejuvenate on the cheap. Are you trying to make me feel guilty? - You of all people? - No. I'm trying to tell you that I'm on the same side as you. I've been trying to convince my mother that what she does... Bullshit! Please. You've got to believe me. Please don't. I won't say another word. I promise. Hey! Hey! Whose side are you on here, huh? Whose side? Yes! I'm doing this for you. For you! We don't even know if you kidnapped the right woman. Even if it is her daughter, then she's probably compatible with you. First-degree blood relatives are almost always a match. We can still use her. "Use her"? Uh, she can just get it back after from her mother. They can sort it out themselves. It's not our problem. The consequences of what we're doing here are absolutely our problem. Oh, okay. So we let her go. I mean, it's just your life. She still has hers. Maybe she wants a child. You've changed. So have you. Is there any running water here? I'd like to clean myself up. Please. Wait a sec. Thanks. My mom just wanted to help Lucy. That's how the whole thing started. She was researching cell aging and made groundbreaking discoveries. But she couldn't find a match for Lucy in time. No, no, no, no. Damn! No. Come on. Hello? Who is this? Kaya? Kaya, you've gotta help me. No, no, no. No. Oh shit. Help! Help me! - Help! - Grab this. With both hands. Thank you. Leave us alone. - Are you sure? - Look at her. Did you hear from the doctor? Mm-mm. What happened with Theissen? She said she wanted to clean herself up, and I didn't wanna be an asshole. Of course not. Are you angry with me? No. Why? Should I be? After everything I've done for you? For me? What about what I need? Are you interested in that? Yeah, right. I'm not doing this for you, for us, or our child. I really don't know what you want from me. She didn't have the operation scar. Th... that's what's bugging you? The skin regenerates during rejuvenation. It's normal. Elli, she... she's manipulating both of us by acting all innocent. You know what went through my mind when I saw her going under? If she dies, then it was all for nothing. She's my only chance. What if we have the wrong person? I don't think I want to know. And that scares the hell out of me. Elli, you were the wrong person. You didn't deserve this. We... we still have our lives ahead of us. We got them. We located them. Finally. Burner phone with dynamic service provider. It always takes a while. They're still in Lithuania. Near ≈†umskas. That's at the border of Belarus, 130 kilometers from here. Then we can start immediately. The reinforcements are here. Let's go! You sure we don't need combat helicopters too? Easy now. If you have any weapons, you better tell us where they are. - Under the pillow. - Classic. Yeah. Who are you? Aeon? On the contrary. Sorry to interrupt. Fuck. What do you want? Hey. Please. Don't kill her. Please. Why would we wanna kill Marie Theissen? What if the Tomas aren't intimidated by our little private army? I'm getting Marie out of there alive. I don't care how. So we'll be digging a couple of graves today. Deep in Lithuanian no-man's-land. You think I would do that? I'm wondering if I could do it. Whether I could live with those ghosts. It isn't easy. I never wanted a longer life. I just wanted to be fit for my job. Youth is... It may sound tempting, but youth alone doesn't make your life better or happier. Just longer. And also full of ghosts. When you've worked in the private sector for so long, you sometimes forget why you started. I know a trick. It's called anchor. Any time I start to doubt, I do this. It reminds me of the reason I started doing this. For justice. What about you? For money? For youth? Sophie Theissen? We're here to free an innocent woman. After that, you'll buy me a drink. You don't give up, do you? All right, then. One drink. When this is done. Okay. Please. Let me go. - I've never had a donation. - I know. But I'm afraid this is much bigger than you. My wife was forced to make a donation. We're the victims here. I know your story, Max. Textbook career, prestigious job, great salary, employee of the year. Always benefited from the system. And then, all of a sudden, your house burns down. Just when Sophie Theissen urgently needs a donation. And your own recipient, Max, just happens to die in a motorcycle accident so that only Elena remains as a donor. So many tragic coincidences. What? W... what are you saying? You were supposed to be Elena's donation manager. Isn't that how you two met? Sophie Theissen already knew back then that Elena was a possible donor. The only match she'd ever really found. You were supposed to convince Elena. Instead, you married her. Too bad for Sophie Theissen. How is she gonna get access to Elena's lifetime now? The apartment that was much too expensive for the two of you? The bank that nevertheless gave you the loan? But only if Elena put up her lifetime as a collateral. Then a little fire, and the two of you are so deeply plunged into financial misery that she could simply take your lifetime. And now the two of you wanna do exactly the same with this girl, the only Theissen with a bit of a conscience. It was a mistake. I didn't know we had the wrong person. Really? After spending two days with her? Or you just didn't wanna see it? You are no better. You're killing innocent people. "Innocent"? Hey. Hey! Hey! Finish what you started. Kill her. Wha... what? What? You were prepared to take 40 years of her life. Obviously you decided some time ago that your life is worth more than hers. That's just sick. I won't do it. Stop. This is madness. I've never done anything. Exactly. What did you ever really do to stop your mother? There's only one bullet, so no funny business. Your life or hers. Make your choice! Please! Please! Please don't! Please. Please. Most people become pacifists when forced to pull the trigger themselves. But if it's doctors in white coats arranging it for you, few have a problem with it. That's why Aeon is so successful and so dangerous. What? Dr. Berg has shared the location of his clinic. Valid for six hours. You're gonna miss that appointment, I'm afraid. Sophie Theissen will be making an appearance soon, and she'll wanna talk to you. Our source is telling us make sure she comes in with you alone, without her guard dogs. Is that clear? We're just the bait. You wanna kill Sophie Theissen. And make a martyr of her? No. We'll take her with us, provided you don't make a mistake. Come on. You've got this. Get down! On the ground now! Marie Theissen is alive. If nothing happens to me, nothing will happen to her. Down on the ground! I wanna talk to Sophie Theissen. Nobody else. Sophie Theissen. If he fucks it up? Plan B. Sophie Theissen leaves either with us or not at all. Judas will take care of that. My wife's youth suits you. Mr. Toma, I understand that you feel that what happened with your wife was an injustice. From your point of view, I can absolutely see why you did what you did. My daughter is innocent. More than anyone else in this. I assume you don't want to hurt innocent people? Only if I'm forced to. Good. I'm prepared to pay you for your wife's years a second time. Ten million. That's more than anyone in your position could hope for. You can start a new life with that. And maybe you'll even find her a new donor. I have one. I'm Donation Manager of the Year. I know how those conversations go. How you list all the advantages of donating like it's a big win for them. All the while knowing you have the upper hand. That you're holding all the aces. And those poor suckers sitting across from you... only had their lives. We have your daughter, and you have my wife's 40 years. If you give those back, then we don't need Marie anymore. If you don't, then we'll have no other choice. Your call. How do I know that Marie's still alive? That she's well? She's not doing well. But she's still alive. You can go see for yourself. In person. Sophie Theissen is not entering the building without me. The very minute any other person goes through that door, my wife pulls the trigger. Then we'll call Marie on the phone from out here. Forget it, guys. I know who I'm dealing with here. People who will do anything, burn down houses, arrange accidents. This deal is going to go down exactly the way I say. All right, I'll come in. Good. I will not lose Marie as well. Just one question, Mr. Toma. You wanted to talk to Sophie Theissen directly. How did you know she was going to be here in person? Say something. You idiot, just say something. It's a trap, Sophie! Fuck! Do it. Sophie! Make sure she's dead. Fire! Fire! Fire! Elena. - Get down! Get down! - Come on! Come over this way! Max, do you... I'm behind you. I've got you covered. Sorry. Please. Let me see my wife. Keep your heads down and stay here. Max! Behind you! Hey. - You all right? - I'm okay. Yes. Yes. - I'm okay. - Thank God. Wait. - Careful. - Quick. Okay. Okay. We're going right now. - Marie! - Come on. Go ahead. Marie! Come on. Let's go. Hey! Let's go! You wanna die here? Come on. Let's go! Let's go. Hurry! Hey! This way. Come on. Come on. Fuck. I'm outta here. Shit! Hey! Enough! Okay. All right. That's it. Let's wrap it up. Moving out. Come on, men. - Did you check the basement? - I checked the whole area. It's not far from here. We almost killed her. She would have shot me. But we know she isn't Sophie Theissen. You said she's also compatible. She can get it back from her mother. Her mother is dead. Marie had nothing to do with it. If we do this, we'll be just like them. Do you wanna be better than them? Or do you want our life back? We wanted to have children. Elena, she's innocent. Our child was innocent too. Theissen took it from us. Theissen burned down our home, had your recipient killed. We need to go public with that. Will that get my years back? Will it? There's gotta be another way to fix this, Elena. It's just not right. I can't see one. I can't do this anymore. We're taking her to a hospital. Get out, please. You can't be serious. Get out. Elena, come on. Let's talk. Get out! Get out. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Move it. Come on, people. Let's go. Hey. Come here. Move. Move. Move. Move! These two boys are going to the doctor. The others can wait for now. What about the girls? - The doctor will see you now. - Thank you. Hello. Are you okay? REFUGEE CAMP ≈†KL√àRIAI LITHUANIA Luckily, you were faster than your colleague. He was not my colleague. Are there any leads yet? We need to find those people as soon as possible. Not my problem anymore. What does that mean? I'm done hunting down people for you. I'm done burning down homes for you. I'm done arranging fatal accidents. I'm done here. We've known each other half our lives! Lives end eventually. Hi, sweetie. Why? They said that you'd be compatible. We are so close to reaching our goals. I'm gonna need all my strength for that. I'll do everything I can to find a donor for you. I promise, sweetie. It's only a matter of time. To buy someone's time is just another way of taking someone's life. I know this now. I've been part of this system. As long as Aeon exists, as long as illegal clinics exist, this injustice will remain. The time to fight is now. If not for us, then for our children.
