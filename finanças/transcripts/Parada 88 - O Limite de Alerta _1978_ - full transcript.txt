GAS CONTROL DEPARTMENT Of course I could speak like in the radio For instance Gentleman Perhaps, never in our previous missions we had to deal with such a hard and dangerous situation as the one we're facing right now in a few moments Here's the deal We're heading to a town called Stop 88 The explosion I mean, the accident Happened on the night of April 21, 1994 The security valve of a reactor belonging to a chemical industry called Night Valley, a cosmetic product manufacturer broke down due to a pressure and temperature overload causing a violent explosion which spread hundreds of kilos of gas dioxins all over town The dioxin, for those unfamiliar Is a trichlorophenol derivative, a toxic reddish cloud which leaves behind a highly poisonous and corrosive powder. The population, on the occasion, was estimated at seven hundred thousand But half perished and those left ended up maimed due to the gas corrosiveness. The entire population has been confined to their homes for five years, since the accident. They're forbidden to leave the protection tunnels by determination of the Health Department. Going inside is also forbidden by the same Department because the authorities fear the danger of spreading the contamination to other areas. Only the sick and the pregnant women are allowed to leave. Dr. Pessoa. I'm sorry, but I don't understand Why were these people confined for so long and nothing has been done about it? Paper! Paper! Stamps! Signatures! Bureaucratic pollution! There's still a leaking reactor at the factory. We must locate this leak And if possible disassemble the reactor and throw it in the ocean The orders are clear we must only locate the leak. So we get more files?! Oh my Why so happy? They'll clear the air in a week from now The men of the gas department are coming. They'll destroy the tunnels. We'll be able to leave for the streets, singing, or silent, anyway we like We can set off fireworks! Rockets! Large Rockets! Ana, Maria 1999 is coming to an end. It's the turn of the century.

You must search for the light When you have in the body pain, fear and uncertainty, which punishes and abuses you You must search for the light When new shadows fall upon old shadows When darkness submerges into other darknessess When the abyss roll inside abyssess You must search for the light Because abysses, darknesses, shadows uncertainties, fear and pain Are dust The limbo and the fire that annihilates Only the light will make clear the ways of extermination and the true ways of a new beginning I'm the extermination and the beginning of a new world I proclaim a new heaven and the new earth Brothers I'm the light that lightens that which the old world dims. From the dark died as if a star was extinguished in the eternal universe In the void. I came to bring peace upon the damned. I came to bring light to the disgruntled and to comfort the poor and the distressed in the kingdom of this decadent world To whoever is thirsty freely I'll give the spring of the water of life I wish to be cured "And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven to earth, and I was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss; and the shaft of the Abyss opened, and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft."
