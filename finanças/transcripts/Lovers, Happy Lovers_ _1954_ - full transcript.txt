"Garrison of battleships "gone suddenly to the ground... "by the shortest route" You are a child. Worse than a woman. I detest you. Don't you understand? You are everything to me-- Are you hurt? A lily, Patricia. You are as beautiful as the flower... that adorns the throne of our kings. Andr?, come back in and stop being a clown. Patricia... Since the first day I saw you... The day of your wedding! You always put Catherine between us. You are her husband! Ah, being finally alone with you... I have so many things to tell you. "You are the woman of my life!" I love you, Pat. My dear Andr?, you use words you don't know the meaning of. Ah, I see. Catherine has come between us again. I'm handicapped, hum ? Heartless I see. Come along. - Sir ? - Yes ? You have left your coat. Thank you ! - Hello? - Hello! Hello, Andr?? Patricia ? - Are you in London? - For two days. Could I speak to Catherine? I'm going pick her up at the airport . She has gone to Edinburgh for eight days. Could you have her call me at Brown's Hotel? Regent... Just a moment. I'm gonna write it down. You are just a few steps away from here, aren't you? Now what did you say? Regent 6020... Regent... 6020. Are you alone, Pat ? Yes, good bye, Andr?. Pat, what if I came by to see you now? No, you would make yourself late. What have I done to you? I'm so very sad, Patricia. Tell me something nice. Pat? Hello? We've been disconnected. Thank you. Close the door. Hello?! Mr. Ripois? Mrs. Ripois calling. Catherine? But...where are you then? Still in Edinburgh. One last conversation with my lawyer. I tell you, the things one must do to get a divorce. I'm sorry. I was just going to pick you to up at the airport. What, you have other old bags to take care of? Why are you being so harsh with me? Did you receive my letter ? Yes. Did you copy it from a broken hearts column? We have to cancel it all, Catherine. Cancel it? You've found the easiest solution. Catherine... Call me tomorrow. My decision is final. Farewell. Oh... Hey ho! You can't do this to Ripois! Diana! My little wild orchid. - Close the door carefully. - Eh ? Isn't it her day out? - I'm expecting friends. - No! Oh ! Just my luck. You had told me that you were engaged this evening. Yes, but that has changed. - Get rid of your friends. Call... - But they're coming. Is there no way to call them off? I don't really want to. - You could join us? - Thank you. Hello, Brown's Hotel? Miss Patricia Hadley, please. Yes, sir. Hello? Patricia ? It's stupid, I didn't think of it, but you could come dine with us, Catherine will be very happy. Gladly. - I'll be there in an hour. - See you soon. - Shall I set the table for three? - No, for two. Uh, yes, for three. Leave everything on the table, We won't need you. But I'm serving. You can take the evening off. Thank you, Sir, but I don't want it. Want it or not, you can go. Hello, Operator? Mayfair 0095. Alright, sir. - Monsieur is very good. - My pleasure. Miss, could you take... - Thank you sir, good evening sir. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Not you, Miss. Could you take my calls until 9:30 and phone me then? That's it. - Thank you. You have a nice voice. - Oh! Ah no, she wasn't on the plane. If I know her, she'll be on the next. Not bad... Candles. I'm a fast learner, aren't I! I thought I was early! Catherine ? She wasn't on the plane. - Why not? - I don't know. - Poor Andr?. - She will take the next one. - Is there another one? - Yes, at 10 o'clock. Ah. We are going to pick her up together. Shall we dine now ? - Without waiting for Catherine? - Catherine ? She'll surely have dinner on the plane - We don't have time. - Everything is ready. Alright. Would you remove your coat? - Champagne? - Why not? For your reconciliation? Sit down. - We should wait to drink it with Catherine. - There are other bottles. What ideas are lurking in your head? Me? Won't you have a glass of champagne? - I don't feel like it now. - Too late. - No Andr?, I beg you. - Another one. - It'll brings luck. - No... Skol. I can't find the teaspoons. I've already asked you not to flirt with me. I'm not flirting with you, Pat. I love you. Isn't it time to pick up Catherine? Don't you understand me? I love you. I only think of you. I can't sleep, I don't eat, or very little. Excuse me. Hello ? - 9:30, sir. - 9:30? Yes. Thank you. Edinburgh. Hello, Catherine?! Fog. All... When will you come back... ? She is coming back tomorrow. - Yes, I see! - I'd like to speak to her. Hello, I can't hear you anymore! Pat would like to talk to you. Don't hang up! Catherine? Hello ? We were disconneted. This is very annoying. Hello? It's always like that, with this telephone line. Alright. In that case, I'm leaving. Aren't you going to eat the strawberries? It's ? la cr?me! We will have another bottle of champagne. - Certainly not. - I wanted to say.. We will have coffee. - Alright. but... - But? But what? I can't spend the evening alone with you. You need a chaperone. I'll phone for one, right away. Hello? A chaperone, please. Yes, a little red chaperone, For the big bad wolf. Here you are. Oh! Teaspoon. You think I'm joking, Pat. You are so wrong. If you only knew what I'm capable of. I'm sure you are not so terrible. Oh yes? I've known a lot of women, Pat. I've treated them all badly. Why? I don't know. Maybe because I couldn't find in them what I was looking for. I've found it in you. You alone could help me. This is a mission you entrust me with? Patricia, I'm very serious. You are the only one who could save me. No one has succeeded. Not Marcelle, or Norah, or Anne. Poor Anne! What did you do to her, then? - Did you kill her ? - No. I made her suffer. Isn't there any coffee? Hum... Well? This Anne... Did you marry her? Not exactly. But after one year, I'd had enough of her cooking. How? Is that the reason you made her suffer? She had started... You know.. the Manchester pudding. Of course! Delicious! - Her's was foul. Gastronomic sacrilege. One beautiful evening I took the sacrilege in my hands and I threw it in the fire ! Of course, it was the end of our relationship. Did she say nothing? Nothing, her? Oh, that was not like her. Oh, you will pay me back. And if you don't like my cooking, you can do you own cooking! French style! And... where did you meet this Fury? One year ago, at the office. We were at the same company. But she had, as they say, a good situation. I was below her. It wasn't pleasant. What I wanted to do was to emmigrate. I didn't want to return to France. After the war, I had remained temporarily. And there I was! Out, madame. Those tables, are they in the indicated place? They're not, are they? But Madame... M. Ripois, even the easiest tasks require... if not a certain intelligence, at least actual attention. I find myself forced to ask you... to examine more carefully... Mr. Ripois' work. Another thing, Mr. Ripois, You do know you may not use the telephone ... for personal calls. What, is this all? We gave you an advance of 5000 F. - Don't you remember ? - Yes. Had I been better paid I wouldn't need advances. Ah yes? Each week, pay day was torture How, I, Andr? Ripois, is this all I've come to earn here, in London? Had I had a small business to run it in my own fashion, with a minimal capital... But once in the street... Ah, the nightmare unraveled, In one shot. As if the blasted office had never existed. And... to celebrate this liberation I was going to change my clothes. Like a lord that was going to dine with another lord. The entire London city, invited me. Among all those women that passed down the street, there was one destined for me, Andr? Ripois. The one... Surely the most beautiful, the most charming of them. The ideal woman. In that search, I felt restless! Walking down a city I love, what a pleasure! But following a woman, that's even better. I sought signs of encouragement the slightest glance that could show a hint of interest. I prepared my blithe, funny phrases... Phrases that allowed me to meet them. But in the last moment, I changed my mind, and resumed my journey, elsewhere. Doesn't matter where. Always in a quest for adventure. There was a type of woman I wasn't interest in, The ones who wanted money. Because I wanted it myself. It was exactly what I needed most. It was astonishing to me, that there was... so much money in the world and so little in my pocket. So I was forced to return to the barracks, without hesitation, humbled. To fall under the thumb, of the officer in a skirt. Yes, sir. Absolutely. In your absence, I took it upon myself to send the letter. Of course. I think it's a good deal for us. Oh, damn! Oh... No sir, you have misunderstood me. - That gave me an idea. - Good bye, sir. A good idea to improve my situation. Hello. The following day, I set out to defeat any resistance with a bold stroke. It was a bit daring, but that was required. I had foreseen everything. Except the unpredictable. Thank you. Be bold, I told myself. Bolder. And there! What is this? If you look more carefully, It's a gift. You're mad. Perhaps. Thank you. To continue my assault, I took the same tube as her. I told her the how much I admired her disciplinary methods, organization, and efficiency. Another one who wants to play the little soldier. I had to give her my place. I was not thinking then... that it was I who was acting the little soldier. I had no doubt.. what was expected of me. To keep my target in sight, I'd gone from employee to slave. Poor Andr? ! It's difficult, no? Not at all, why? No, it's going well. It' going very well. Andr? ! It's too high. Hurry, my love, If you want to put the furniture back before dark. Easy housework, moving furniture. Damn! Ah, how stupid! Table's uneven. Tired, hum ? Mmmm ! Oh! Andr?? Hum? And that lasted one year. At her side, I felt so lonely. She thought she was the center of the world. In spite of her passion for me, in fact, she only thought of herself. You'd met someone just like you. Maybe. At last, after the battle of the Manchester pudding, I had one victory, so right away I took advantage. The following day, after leaving the office... I'm going for a walk. - See you soon. - See you soon. Andr? ? Please, don't come back home late. Are we married? No. Then? I hadn't married her, of course. Stupid to say so, just like that. You'll tell me that was no reason to go lurking about other women so soon. Agreed, but.. I felt perhaps like a change. Undoubtedly a young woman, anyway. She didn't look easy to approach. To get there, I needed to be more subtle in my technique. What is it? You didn't even ask my name. Norah. Andr?. She had a weakness for horror movies. The ones that discourage any advances in the dark. And despite that, she wanted me to believe... there was something between us. I wonder what you think of me. Do the young French girls flirt like that? Anyway, I have to go. My family will be angry, if am late. Ah... You live with your father. And your mother. And my brother. And my two sisters. Ah... Are they all angry when you're late? What if we went for a walk tomorrow? It's Sunday. Yes. At Green Park Station? - 2 o'clock near the kiosk. - Yes. Theres' the bus! - Goodbye then. - Goodbye. - Thank you for a beautiful evening. - Not at all. Goodbye. Clearly, with Norah it wasn't going to be easy. But I can be patient. With Anne, on the other hand, I'd had enough. I didn't feel like putting up with her any longer. That comedy had lasted too long. If she dares say anything, I'll leave her! "In the middle of the night" ? It's 11:45! I will teach you to live! Darling... Take good care of yourself. Are you pleased with this? - Is this ok? - It's fine, thank you. Could you serve tea? Naturally. - I'll bring it to you. - No, not now. Later. - For two? - Yes. Maybe for one. I'll tell you. What are we going to do? Ah! Think of something. What if we had tea? But it's only 2:30! If I only knew you better... I would suggest you come to my place... Look, I think it'll clear up. You know, I live 5 minutes from here. No, I can't. What would my mother say? I don't see why she should know. And if we went to the National Gallery? Painting depresses me. Or to the Museum of Science ? I'm not scientific. Oh, the poor little thing.. Oh, poor thing... C'mon, go away. Goodbye. One has to go to England to see such weather! It never rains in France? No. Oh... Oh, poor thing. How clingy that mutt is! But he seems lost. Maybe he's hungry. We must give him somthing to eat. Oh yes. - But on Sunday, everything is closed. - This is awful. I have everything he needs at my place. Really? You like dogs! I adore them. Come. Come, we will have tea. If you continue, I... I will leave. But I don't understand anything anymore. We can kiss. in the rain, but not here? Why? Because... Andr?! I'm angry. Very angry with you. You are not... a gentleman. I didn't mean to... Norah! No more Norah. I don't trust you anymore. No... No. It's over! Over! Over! Norah ? Now, really... there's no reason... You awful. I'm leaving. Good, leave. Run to mommy! Become a nun! Like Shakespeare said... And you, get the hell out of here. Go! The poor dog. He must not understand what happened to him. I could have kept him with me, for the company. Obviously, not a brilliant result. But I persisted. I play dirty! I don't like losing. And so, I was going to wait outside of her office. Until then, Norah had scored all the points. It was up to me to win the second match. And the beautiful girl. I told Norah a fairytale. very rich, My rich parents... I had a dispute with. In a few weeks, I would receive a small fortune. A few thousand pounds. And we could get married. From that point, in our walks, she was dragging me to furniture stores. Well, Andr?... It's crazy, all the things we need to buy! It was easy to guess her thoughts. For her, happiness meant spending.... piles of money on saucepans. For many things I'll need mother's opinion, hum? - That's a good idea.. - Yes. Our place! Ah... Our place. Wonderful words, no? It's hard to believe happiness is so close... You will leave your job. Yes, you must. You have a home to take care of. As for me, I'll have a small business. My own business. Where I'll will rule. What type of business? I'm just contemplating the many possibilities. And in the evening, I'll come home. I'll find my sweet periwinkle. And my dear slippers. Sometimes, my little flower will come pick me up in the city. We'd go to the theatre. The two of us. Just the two of us. And afterwards? - Afterwards ? - Yes. We'd dine in a fancy place where we could dance. Like at Saint-Germain-des-Pr?s. Oh yes... And then the voyages! Paris. Venice. Ah, the gondolas! Naples. India. The blue waves. Happiness. Don't cry. I'm happy. Poor darling. I'll have to tell mother. What? Tell her what? That we are engaged. Ah yes... Of course. You will come to our house. And I will present you. But of course. Of course, we shall see. Dear Andr?! I know what you're thinking of. Yes? You can tell Mrs Cummings that... for reasons... at least unexpected... beyond my control... I.. I have to leave this room today. Well what? Were you proud of yourself? Yes. But I'm not any longer. Are you sure? Yes. Do we tell things we're not proud of? We can, to a certain person. The one we love. Could I have some more coffee? No. At last, I was dismissed. I had been sacked. Sacked, yeah? "Darling, take good care of yourself." Andr?... You must have a really contemptible soul... to think me capable of such a thing. Weeks passed. I would emmigrate again. Jobs were scarce for a Frenchman in London. I hadn't payed for my room for more than a month. Yes? Yes, come in. So? I think I've found something. - I have two addresses, I think... - You think so, eh? You think so? Well, I don't think so. When you stop thinking, I'll give them back. Oh, leave your things here, hum? Ah... Jingling. Oh! A teapot... Why were people crowded along the Thames? What were they looking at? A nautical anniversary? A whale? Or a man about to drown? Those imbeciles! They had a place to go home to. I was the one who was going to drown. And that swine of a landlord... What else had he done but force my head even more under water? I needed to sleep. Spending the night outside... I... Ripois. Others, what would they do in my position? Oh, they already knew. But I, it was the first time for me. I still had my radio. I'd rather die than sell it. They had eaten. While I thought... never ever... would I taste cream cake again. I was not superstitous, but... I was becoming frightened. I couldn't possibly spend another night outside. Not possible. I was too frightened, I was too hungry. I was willing to do anything! Shall we take a taxi? Oh... If you don't mind, let's walk. Let's walk then. A little more or less won't matter... It's here. - Is someone there? - Don't be silly, it's the radio. It's company for Tarzan. So, are you very annoyed? Close the door. So, you're French? I'm glad I'm able to speak French. I have clients who like to have me speak in French, but it's not the same thing when they don't understand it. My little gift, please. What's the matter with you ? What's the matter with you? What's got into you ? This now! What's wrong? I don't have any money. No money? No money?! Very cheeky of you. Or you've gone crazy! I haven't eaten for two days. And I started to tell her my life story. Like you've told me? No. Only what was needed to soften her. And what about me? Aren't you trying to soften me too? No, Pat. I only want to show you myself as I am. Are you truly hungry? Hum? It's true... Wait a minute. She has a nice place. Come. Don't eat so fast, you'll be sick. That's better. What are you going to do now? I could... I could maybe stay here. Since your - through for the night. It's cold outside. You're telling me! Oh, sorry... - Is this for me? - Of course! Dear God, bring me back to my beatiful childhood to Saint-Fran?ois, in Kings Basin, Dear God, give me back a little innocence. And the scent of the quays when it was cold. Let me again see the exquisite snow falls. The rain in Sanvic shimmering on the rooftops. The kids crowding outside the church My first kiss on the wooden horse. My poor darling... Why did you come to London? Finally, a moment of relief.. Marcelle was a nice girl. Her one fault was she expecting an inheritance. Really! 3000 pounds and an ironware shop in Staffordshire. Spending her time on the phone with her solicitor. But anyway, she was a nice girl. She was anxious to present me, to her friends. I don't want to stay. - What are you going to do? - Go to the cinema. There's Marcelle! Good evening, everyone. - Good evening, Marcelle. - Good evening, Dick. - Sir. - Good evening. So, Marcelle, you had a nice holiday? Let me introduce my friend Andr?. Are you coming, Andr?? Maisie Smith. - Mme Rose.. Art, from Chelsea. - Bruno, from Malta. - Good evening.. And Charles, from our place. - How are you? - Well, thank you. Don't by silly. Do you offer a drink to friends? Dick? Dick? Same again. And you? Yes, yes. Congratulations. Where'd you find him? Maisie, enough. What do you expect ? We are not invulnerable. Pay no attention. It's only women's chatter. Been here long time? Cigarette? Thank you, yes. - It's 8 o'clock! - Oh! - Blimey, it's late. - Well, here's to Marcelle. Cheers! - What's the matter? - Nothing. I'd like to leave. Andr?? Andr?? Andr?? - What's wrong? - Oh, nothing. - You didn't like my friends? - It's not that. You weren't very polite to them. I'm sorry. I hadn't realized I was a pimp. Why do you say that? Because I gave you money in front of them? That doesn't make you my pimp. You're just my fancy, That's all. I have money, you don't, so I give you some. When you find a job, you'll pay it back. True? Of course. Well, you see.. Andr?? You haven't found anything yet? No. The good jobs, you don't find them in newspaper ads. Poor darling. I know what you're thinking of. Your small business, where you'd be the boss. Only... if you had the dough, you'd not care for Marcelle any longer. For now I have you only for myself. Anyway, I'm nice, aren't I? It's been only a week since we met. Strange, one doesn't need much time to fall in love. I didn't want her dough, as she called it. I could see it coming. Accepting it was out of the question. For the first time, I thought of leaving. - She's not there. - What? - She went out. - She was making lunch. She went out to make a call, because of a problem. - A misfortune! - Probably... It wasn't a misfortune, it was her fortune. The 3000 pounds. But I had made up my mind. I had to leave. I don't like the pretending. I don't know if I should laugh or cry. Hurry up, it's almost 3 o'clock. My God, I'm gonna be late! If you want, we could sell the shop. Yeah... Unless you'd prefer to live in Staffordshire. - Yeah... - I'll buy you a new suit. A Prince of Wales. It'll suit you. I have you be there at half past 3. I'll give you 100 pounds for your business. - 50 is enough. - No! 100! Do I look fit to go to the solicitor? More than fit. If I charm him, perhaps he'll reduce his fee! I'll make you the happiest man on the earth. Forty... Fifty. I had established in Hampstead area, a beautiful area. And for the first time, I was my master. At the time, I thought I'd made a good start. That name: Cadet-Chenonceaux... I had such trouble finding it! I'd though hard before choosing my fictional name. I settled for a touch of aristocracy. "Cadet-Chenonceaux," sounds good, no? -Le grand-p?re prend..."son" canne! (Grandfather takes his cane). -Sa canne. Why ? Because it's feminine. We say "une canne". Go on. La grand-m?re prend.. (Grandmother takes...) sa ombrelle! (her umbrella). Son ombrelle. Why? Because it's feminine. We say "une ombrelle". - Like "une canne"! - Yes. - I don't understand.. - Look, it's very easy. We say "sa" canne, it's feminine. We say "son" ombrelle, it's feminine. It doesn't matter. You'll understand all this when you are older. Go on. - My grandfather's father... - Is my grand grandfather. I was constantly adding up. 6 pupils with 4 lessons each in one week... and 1 who had only 3, at 5 shillings a lessons, I had to have a sheet of paper. From the beginnig: 6 times 4, 24, plus 3 equals 27. Multiplied by 5 135 shillings. Divided by 20... Well, go on.. "Be wise, o my Sorrow..." "and be quieter." "You called for the Evening;" "it descend; here it is:" "A gloomy atmosphere..." "envelopes..." "the city," -The city. "To some bringing peace," - "to others worry." - To others worry. "The worry" With more enthusiasm, with feeling. Let's start again. "To some bringing peace, the others worry." To others worry! You're reading it like it was a were a grocery list. "While the vile multitude of mortals..." "Under the whip...of..." "Pleasure." So sorry. Alright. Continue. Let's see, 3 pupils with 3 lessons a week... ...and one with 2. That means 3 times 2, 6 and 2, 8... By 5 shillings. That meant 40 shillings diveded by 20. It meant only 2 pounds.. At the end of one or two months, I didn't have any pupils left. My calculation were made hastily. What had become of my grand ambitions? Nothing. Zero. Come in! Mr. Cadet-Chenonceaux ? It me...M Miss. The mother of a young boy whom you gave lessons to... Richard. Oh yes. She has spoken of you with satisfaction. Mr. Cadet-Chenonceaux. I am glad to see my merits acknowledged. Naturally, I'm not coming for a French lesson. Oh? What do you think of my French? It's remarkable, Miss. Thank you. I'm not coming exactly for literature lessons.. but to ask you for some advice. Sit down. Regarding modern literature... Modern? Yes, yes, yes. Naturally. Mr. Cadet-Chenonceaux, Who is your favourite French author? Modern, of course. There are so many! No one? That's not at all what I wanted to say. - You like no one? - No. I prefer the classics. Such as? Eh, such as... Well... Let's say... Lamartine. Alexandre Dumas. Bossuet. Really? Yes. Are these the books you choose your lessons from? Yes. "I Spit on Your Grave" "Intimate Journal of Sally Mara" "Hands off the Loot." You don't approve of these choices... They are eclectic. I've started a laborious translation. And I thought, that anyhow, you could help me. - A cigarette? - Thank you. Light? - Mr. Cadet-Chenonceaux ? - Yes? I wrote a small poem in French. that I would like you to read. Please, take it.. I would like you to tell me what you think of it. and to correct my mistakes, if there are any. But.. With pleasure. You'll have your first lesson now? - Are you busy now? - No. Not at all. I have all the time in the world. Please. -"The virgin, vivid and beautiful today". It's Parisian. Oh... Oh... It's gorgeous. ...and it weighed more than a pound. A pound of solid gold, plus small diamonds. Worth a fortune! Just thinking about all that money there, before me, I felt dizzy. "He becomes immobile in the cold dream of scorn..." "That's adorned during the useless exile..." "of the Swan." Amazing. Oh, wonderful. I don't doubt it. It's a sonnet by Mallarm?. No! Mr. Cadet-Chenonceaux ? For how long have you given lessons of French literature? Miss. I'm just having my first lesson! At least you're being honest! That's where I saw you for the first time, Patricia. Do you recall, Pat ? You're looking as me as if it were all my fault. Won't you help me, Pat ? Your confession is over, isn't it? Then I can leave. Patricia. Andr?. You can't leave now. All my life depends on you. I've laid out everything before you, my wretched life. You see that I have never loved, that never loving anyone is my tragedy. And then, I finally meet my true love. The woman of my life, it's you, Pat. It's you. Without you, I'm lost. If I understand you well, You're inviting me to do a good deed? Patricia... Like Anne, like Norah, like Marcelle, like Catherine... You thought it was my turn now? My poor Andr?. But, Patricia... Don't you see I've changed? Do you understand? I've changed. Since I love you, I've changed. I don't believe you.. Alas. Alas? You said "Alas." - But then, if you believe me... - Andr?, we'll see.. - I'm not indifferent to you... - Pat... But you are an impossible man. This evening, again, You're machinations to get me here. What machinations? That telephone call... was it from Edinburgh? No. Thus, Not an hour passed and you're still playing your comedy. The last one... How could you expect a woman to believe you? You'll end by believing me, by believing my love. I'll give you proof. I'll give it right now. I'm leaving Catherine! Really? Yes. We are divorcing. Well... I want a divorce. And what does Catherine say? - She agrees. - I can believe that! Please, don't joke, I swear it. Catherine and I, it's over! Now there's nothing against us... Except me! I love you, Pat, I love you. How can I put the slightlest trust in you? Yes... How could you confide in me? But... But...everything I've told you about myself... that was unfavourable to me... doesn't that prove I'm sincere? You've chosen to see in that some sort of ruse... But I was being sincere! Oh, without you, I have nothing left but to die. You are very odd. I've come to tell myself... that maybe.. I should believe it. Oh, Pat... What is that? - Andr?, did you hear? Who's there? - I don't know. Go open it, it might be Catherine. I'm going. - Darling! - Oh it's you. What do you want? - They left. - Who left? - My friends. - No, you can't come in. Why not? There's someone... - Who's there? - It's Catherine. Be quiet, she's back. Go. - Phone me. - Yes. - Tomorrow. - Yes, OK. Who was it? No one. A friend. You're leaving? - Yes, I'm leaving. - No, Pat. I can't stay here all night! - It this the end, then? - Not at all, my dear Andr?. I've told you, Pat. Without you, I've nothing left but to die. We don't die because of a small Waterloo. Don't start it again, please! Patricia ! I'll never change my mind about this! All this ringing! It's for me, I've called for a taxi. - Would you answer it? - No! Good bye, Andr?. Pat! Andr?, I beg you! Patricia ! Patricia! You asked for it. Patricia? I warned you. Andr? ! Andr? ! Ouch! Andr?!! Andr?! Oh, my God. Poor Andr?. I should have never... I was a fool to have left you alone with her. Patricia ? What's happened? Nothing. What do you mean, "Nothing?" Really nothing. Then, it's because of me. Oh, Andr?... Andr?! My darling! What madness! You know I would have never left you. Never. Now, you are a real man. How much you've suffered to come this far. Heu... Don't speak. Isn't it my turn to push? No Dear, It's your turn to carry. You pushed it yesterday. But you've been pushing since morning, you must be tired. No, not at all. Allow me... Now, he's all mine.. And we'll live happily ever after. Subtitles revised by Bill Davis
