Actually, can I have two more? Yeah, sure. - Yeah, that's cool. - Thanks. All right. Oh, and matches. Do you have... - Matches? - Matches or-- You want cocaine also? -No, I just-- -I'll give you a lighter. I got a lighter-- -Okay. -Somewhere in here. Hold up. Oh, where the heck is it? Hey, babe. I know you're on moon mode this weekend, do not disturb, but I wanted to show you that this mornin'-- I learned how to slap the bass! Pretty cool, right? Give me a call if you want. All right. Love you. Bye. Hey, babe, just sending you a quick voice note. Uh, you know, if this is too much, you can always turn around. There's nothin' wrong with that. Oh, come on. New message. Sorry again to call, but it's been a crazy past few weeks for you and I think there's a silver linin' for you getting away for a couple of nights, you know, somewhere nice. Okay, I'm going to leave you alone now. No more phone calls, for reals. Bye. Hmm. That looks nice. What are you doing? Just start unloading, I guess, yeah? Okay. Thanks, guys. Uh, yeah. Oh! Hey! I'm Sandra, the party planner. Did you want us to set up in front or around back? Am I stupid? I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry, I-- I thought I cancelled this. The-- the party's cancelled. Oh! No, I don't think so. No, no, I'm-- I'm cancelling it now. No, you can't do that. You are-- you're way past the 24-hour cancellation period, so... Okay, well, I don't want it, so take it back. Uh, uh, I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do. There's nothing you can do? All you have to do is not do anything. That's how you don't have a party. Okay, legally, because you missed the 24-hour cancellation deadline, I have to set up a party. I legally have to have a party? Uh, I-- I guess I could try to do something. - Uh, yeah. - I guess you could. - That'd be nice. Thank you. - So... What I need to do is talk to the person who authorized the payment, and that would be Jennifer Martinez. Okay. Yeah, great. - Let me get her. - Okay. Jennifer! Jennifer! Jen! Oh, that's right. She's dead. - Shit. - Yeah. I'm sure you could reach her if you have a medium or a shovel. So, sh-- she was your, um... We were best friends and business partners. We made an organic soda and we just -got a distribution deal to be in stores. -Oh, that's big! Yeah, I know, Sandra, it's very big. - It's huge. - Mmhmm. That's why we rented this place originally. That's why we were gonna throw a party originally. But none of that matters now, because she's gone. So, could you please just cancel the party? What are you doing? No, because you missed the cancellation deadline. Okay, got it. You know what? I'll-- I'll bet it'd be fun if you threw yourself a party, huh? I bet your friend would-- would have liked that. Would you like a Xanax? - No. What? - Okay. Okay, yeah, all right, I'll take one. What if I take half? Just-- no, you need the whole one. - Okay. Thank you. - Yeah. Okay. Yeah, Sandra here. Just keep setting it up. Yeah, it's gonna be a party for one. Yeah, but we're gonna just download the... Hi, I'm supposed to tell you that the uh, the trays marked with an M are for meat, they have meat, and then the ones marked with a V have veggie. Did you get veggie or is that-- I don't fuckin' know. Just put it in the house. Okay. Stupid fuckin' sunset. To Jennifer. Okay. No. Shit. I'm solids. You're stripes. Look, I'm Jennifer. That's me. ♪ Do you legally have to throw a party ♪ ♪ Call Sandra ♪ ♪ Party attorney at law ♪ Oh, bicyclette! Let's get some cheese and go to the Louvre. I'm Emily in Paris! Okay. Goodnight, Milwaukee! Eric, are you getting this? Yep, takin' video. Right. Wooh! Two Rings forever, baby! Vanessa, what are you doing? I am just making sure. You're making sure of what? You already read it! Just sign it! I know. I am, I am. I am. Sign it! Sign it! Sign it! I-- uh-- uh, look what I'm doing. Vanessa. -Mmhmm. The lawyers read through it, you read through it, it's all there, we got a distribution deal. It's happening. It's happening. It'll happen faster if you sign it. Okay. All right. Eric, horizontal. Uh, yes, I knew that. Sorry. Oh. Coffee? Yeah. Thanks, Jen. Jesus! Pancakes. No. What... I know this is an odd encounter. My appearance resembles your perished companion. Unfortunately, Jennifer continues and will continue to remain deceased. I am simply an extraterrestrial who has taken her form. Now that you have had ample time to comprehend what I have said, please stop leaving! Eric, I'm coming home. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's goin' on? Are you okay? Are you hurt? No, I just-- I was, um... I don't know, I was inside and then... I don't know. I'm-- I feel like I'm going crazy. Babe, your best friend passed away. It's gonna take time. You're-- you're processing. I'm processing. Yes. Yeah, yeah! You're-- you're-- you're havin' a moment! Yeah, I was having a moment. Exactly! I just don't wanna totally lose it out here, Eric. Come on. Come on, Vanessa, you're not gonna lose it! You're like a freak of nature. Like a total freakin' freak of nature. Okay, I feel um, better. I'm-- I'm breathing at least. Yeah, yeah. You know, maybe go outside, take a hike, get some fresh air. That might be nice. Okay. Thank you. Don't come out here, I'm fine. Nope, wasn't thinkin' about comin' out there. I was thinkin' about goin' halfway, though. Eric, I'm-- I'm fine. Yeah. Okay. But maybe I just look at hotel prices just in case. Honey, stop. Okay, okay. I-- I love you. I love you. Bye. What were you gonna do? Key your friend? You've returned. Shall we proceed? No, no, no, no. I don't wanna go crazy. I can assure you my appearance is not a result of you going crazy. Okay. You are watching your dead best friend chug olive oil. This galaxy sun damages my structure. We have discovered that oil provides protective lubrication. Margarita? No! No, I don't want a margarita. I wanna know what's happening. Then shall we begin orientation? What? Shall we? Oh, you want me to sit? Shall we? Are you just gonna keep saying "shall we" until I sit down? -Shall we? -Okay, okay. Hello. Hi. Oh. Okay. I am a species observation officer. Is that supposed to be me? Yes, and that is me. On this maiden voyage, our mission is to study human subjects, so that we may have a full comprehension of your species. Why? To kill us? We have not discovered a benefit to your destruction. We will focus on your physical and cognitive abilities, as well as other behaviors and emotive response. It is similar to how your species studies other species. After 48 hours, I will depart without having harmed you in any way. That's nice. So, I shouldn't have taken that Xanax with a bottle of champagne. And I probably choked on my own vomit. And I died on this lounge chair, which is why I'm back. Okay. No, incorrect narrative. Okey dokey. You must have inquiries. No, I-- I think I'm gonna go. Where will you go? To the hospital. No, I just charged, this was at 30%. That is because of your device's proximity to me. My planet is made up of what you would call "lightning storms", which we have adapted to. Thus, we absorb the battery life of anything around us with a battery life. And we can conduct heat. Observe. Okay. It's part of the process. Just you miss your best friend who died, so you conjured up this fucked up-- no offence, alien version of her. Inaccurate. If I'm truly hallucinating, then this won't hurt. -Injury imminent. -Ow! Mm, ow! That-- okay, that's real. That is very real, which means I must have blacked out, started the fire, and then blacked back in. Blacked back in. I don't know. Let me think. What are you doing? These hair pouches torment me. They are always there when I look up. Have you ceased thinking? Do you consent to testing? It's my choice? Yes, you have control. Yes. Yes, I do. It is in my control, because I am a strong, powerful woman. A freak of nature, some have said. And I am perfectly capable of taking charge of my own mental breakdown. It's my decision. So, my decision next will be to have this margarita. Cheers. I would also like to-- oh, that's delicious. Wait, how do you know I like pomegranate and jalapenos? I have all of Jennifer's memories. In exchange for your participation, you receive two days with your dead best friend. Why did you not lead with that? My brain. I will make a note. For future visits, lead with memories. So I can just ask you anything I want? You may. This is good. I like that. Okay. I'm gonna test you. What is Jennifer's favorite color? Wait, that's a stupid question. Hot pink. I mean, of course, you get the clue from the hair. In college, I had a pet lizard. I went away for the weekend and Jennifer told me that he died of natural causes. Is that true? No. Jennifer accidentally impaled it with a high heel. Franklin. I mean I have no way of knowing if any of this is real. Okay, this is something I only told Jennifer. In second grade, I told everyone that I kissed Tyler, but the real person that I kissed behind the dumpster was-- Cody who smells grody. Dammit. Whatever. Fine. I guess I'm in. It might be fun to see how unstable I can get. If this is what you find to be fun, then I do hope we achieve it! So, if you are really an alien, why was I chosen as the human subject? Species observation officers do not have jurisdiction over who their subject is. I was assigned to you. Oh, sorry. That is Jennifer's ring? Yeah. Jennifer uh, got us these for my 8th birthday. I asked all the girls in our class to come over for a slumber party, but Jennifer was the only one who showed up. My mom went hard for the theme, too. It was out of this world, which is why I am imagining this. Jennifer mixed syrupy soda with fizzy candy and experienced excessive regurgitation that night. Yeah, she-- she puked really hard. It was probably more of a positive memory for me than her. Jennifer wrote in her diary, "Best night ever". Test complete next. Fifth grade, we rode our bikes downtown, got lost, had to call my parents to pick us up. And I was grounded for a month. Tell me which letter you see. I mean are we-- this is how we're starting? Tell me what letter you see. Q. - And now? - E. Jennifer's favorite movie was Fight Club. I don't know where this one's coming from. Oh, summer boot camp! We quit June 1st. Subject bladder evacuation speed below average. Well, just give me a second. I can get one more second out. Dammit. Okay, am I following you, 'cause I'm not doing that. What are you doing? Now, I will be performing an audiometry evaluation. Please turn around. Identify where the sound is coming from. I don't hear any-- left. Right. Right again. Both sides now. Adult female hearing, average. What? I was just being playful. Adult female being playful. Okay, what's next? Oh! Aquatic Agility Assessment. What are you doing? I am being playful. Are you trying to s-- smile? Am I succeeding? No. No. -All right, so-- -Like don't suck your bottom lip under your whole mouth. What are we doing? What are we doing right now? -Aquatic agility analysis. -Then, let's start. Let's start. 45 seconds. Nice. Lung capacity of human female minimally above average. Oh. And don't you forget it. No, please do not touch this. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to touch your recorder thingy. Why are you still here, by the way? Shouldn't you have disappeared by now? I am not sure how you have come to this conclusion. I said my goodbyes to Jennifer. I mourned her. I mean I'm-- I'm good unless-- Oh, is there something that she needs to tell me before she can cross over? Oh! No, I am afraid oxygen deprivation has confused you. I am not a ghost. Shall we do orientation once more? No, no. No, no, no. We're good. We're good. You're not a ghost. Noted. You wanna see me do a cannonball? Like Jennifer did at the end of every swim meet? Yes, which is exactly why I am hallucinating this scenario. Your dad came to every meet. Yeah. God, he was so embarrassing. Jennifer's dad never came to a swim meet. He did not even know she was on the team. He knew. He just uh, didn't care. Same for the funeral. All right, time this one. Do you eat? It is not necessary for survival, but I am capable of doing so. On my planet, we receive sustenance via injection of vitamins. The human body is gravely inefficient at processing nutrients. It's not about processing nutrients. I really like cooking. Something about it calms me. It's the predictability or something. You mix flour with sugar, you're gonna make cookies. Well, there's other steps in between, but you get it. Your soda recipe was a mistake. Not my mistake. Jennifer? Yeah. Uh, it was a decent soda before Jennifer accidentally put way too much ginger in it, and then it was just um, too good to deny. That's Jennifer. Hmm. Oh. You just put the whole thing in? How's it going? Eating food? Jennifer's memories indicate you were a chef, but the flavors and textures of that small sandwich are causing positive explosions of saliva in my mouth! That's-- that's good. Human sense memory inferior to present experience. Thank you. Shall we continue? What is that cracking sound? I'm 36. Elevate your arms. Move your head on a vertical axis. What is-- oh, nod? ♪ Cut my life into pieces ♪ ♪ This is my last resort ♪ Yes, that's where this is from. Papa Roach, middle School. We were obsessed with them. When we finally saw them in concert, oh, Jennifer pulled me into the mosh pit, and I immediately got a black eye. Oh, my mom was pissed, but it was amazing. Breathe. -Jennifer enjoyed that evening also. -Yeah. I mean that was our first time seeing them, so we talked about it for months. It was not Jennifer's first time. What? She saw them the year before with her sister. No, she-- no, she didn't. She did. No, she, uh... She would have told me. She never told you. Why wouldn't she tell me? She wouldn't lie to me. Her memories indicate she lied to you, because she felt telling you the truth would hurt you. No, please do not leave again. No, I just-- I have to pee again and you already have that research, so just stay here. Vanessa? Hey, Megan. How are you doing? You know, going crazy. Yeah, us too. Hey, tell your mom I said "hi". I will. I was actually calling you to ask you something weird. Oh, okay. Um, did you and Jennifer go see Papa Roach a year before we went? What? Okay, never mind. I... She told you? She swore me to secrecy. It was so hard not to say anything when you guys went on and on about that night you saw them. When did she tell you? Um, earlier this year. Actually, uh, I thought she was just tryin' to piss me off. Vanessa, she literally told me she would take that to the grave. She loved you so much, Ness. Goddamn it. I keep thinking like-- I have to go, actually. Subject seems to be in distress. Jesus, you scared the shit out of me. What? What are you doing? We do not have this. What? Tears? We do not have crying. This is valuable data. Thank you. This is where you hibernate for six to eight hours nightly? I hibernate in a jelled capsule of dioxane. I awake in three months feeling rejuvenated. You look so much like her. I know. Everything is exactly the same. Except for my coccyx bone. Mine looks like... Like this. I wanna show you something. Okay. Okay. ♪ I can see that you are waitin' ♪ ♪ For my time to come, but I am lost inside ♪ ♪ If I can be that lost from the inside ♪ ♪ How am I alive ♪ Where are you taking me?

No, I'm not slowing down. I-- uh, my foot is on the gas. Why is the battery charge going down? Are you draining us? Like my phone? I thought automobiles were powered by gas. Not this one. It's electric! Boogie woogie woogie. That was Jennifer's favorite wedding song. Out. Out of the car. Damn it. Damn it! Vanessa, how do I get out? - It-- Vanessa, how do I get out? It's the fucking button. The button. Oh. Oh. What is your plan? I don't know. I don't know anything about cars, but oh, my phone. I don't have my phone. I don't have my phone! Extreme levels of stress caused by minor deviation in plan. It's not a minor deviation, we are stranded. Except for this person. There are vehicles passing by that are not electric. We could ask for transportation. No, I'm not doing that. Jennifer's memories indicate that this will lure male drivers. What are you do-- s-- no, no! Put that down. Get out of the road. No. The only people who pick up hitchhikers are murderers. Thank you. I should be home with Eric watching him practice on his stupid fucking bass! Human has turned anger onto herself and Eric's stupid fucking bass. We're walking. We're walking! We cannot walk back. We're walking, that's the plan. I cannot walk. Why? Why? Why? Oh, that's gross. I have been too long without oil. Oh, shit. Hello! [engine stops] Hey, y'all need a jump? Um, no. No, we're good. Thank you. Hey, you wanna bum another smoke? Oh, yes. Hello. No, I'm good. We're-- we're pretty good across the board, so thank you. All right. Nice seeing you again. -No. -It's fine. Just-- -No. -Okay. All right. Um, actually, could I use your cell phone to call Triple A? Uh, Triple A is a scam. No dice. If you need a tow, I'll go ahead and call one of my friends. No, no, I think we're uh, good. Vanessa. This man is offering aid, which is what we are in need of. He wants to help. Yeah, he wants to help murder us. Murder is not really my thing. Mm, I didn't realize I said that so loud. Exceptional news! Holy! Is this one of those computer cars? Uh, yes, but don't touch it, please. - Oh, my gosh! - Okay. This is some high fancy crap! It's actually my boyfriend's uh, car. Yeah, he's super strong and it has a tracking device, so he knows where we are right now. Also, he plays bass. Uh, he sounds like a pretty cool dude. Uh, hey, I got a buddy Marcus who's a huge nerd. I guarantee he could hack this thing in like 20 seconds. Umm, I don't think we need a nerd. No, I think we're good. No Marcus, I think. - Okay. - Yeah? I'm gonna go ahead and text him. - Vanessa. - Hmm. What does it feel like? What? To be unreasonable. I'm not unreasonable, we don't know this man. You're an alien. Can't you just beam us up, Scotty? I do not know what is beam us up, Scotty, but I do not think I can do it. I am parched. These are pestering me. Just leave them alone. Your eyebrows. Uh, is this a TV in here? What are you doing? Can you watch TV while you're driving? No! You can't-- sh-- shoo, shoo, shoo. All right. Dang! Oh, hey. Marcus said his shift is about to end. He could be here in 25 minutes. Vanessa, my skin is boiling. I need oil. If he kills us, I'm gonna be pissed. 25? Is that what you said? Yeah. Great. We'll wait for Marcus. You guys want any Subway? Um, I don't think we... I-- I think we're good. All right, I'm gonna get cold cut trio. It's a rad jacket. Hey, so what's your name? Vane-- la. What brings you out here, Vanilla? I'm celebrating. What's the occasion? Do you really care? We don't have to do this. Yeah, I care. A distribution deal. For what? My friend and I made an organic soda. Organic soda. Like you put grass in it or whatever? What? No, it's just natural ingredients. Oh, I probably wouldn't like that. That's fine. So is the party over? No, uh, it never started because of my partner. Oh. They screw you over or something? Yeah. She died. Uh. I'm sorry to hear that. How did she croak? Hole in the heart. No one knew. She had a stroke. And now, you have a hole in your heart. You have a hole in your heart, 'cause you missed a great party. That's so stupid. I can't believe I just laughed at that. So, did you guys have a clause in your shareholders agreement in case of the event of the death of a partner? Are you a businessman? Yeah. Really? Yeah. All right. Uh, no, we didn't have that. So, what are you gonna do now? I don't know. That's not true. I'm dissolving her half of the business and I'm-- I'll own all the shares. And now you have to run the whole thing by yourself. Man, she really did screw you over. Yeah, she really did. Hey, Marcus. No, we're on Highway 51, at the mile marker, uh-- uh-- Marcus? Marcus? My phone died. I-- I just charged this. I can give you guys a ride. Hop in. Do you have seatbelts? No. This is good. Thanks. Hey, as soon as my phone comes back online, I'll call Marcus and have him drop the car here. Oh, great. Thank you so much. You've been very helpful. Yeah, no problem. Hey! Yeah. She's not comin' back. What the fuck? Vanessa, did you see the hues of the sunset on our way back? I have never seen anything that beautiful. They were pink and gold. It made my skin tingle. Although, we have arrived to base safely, the human has not yet de-escalated from previous incident. Will you stop with that fucking thing? Just stop! This weekend has been exhausting. You are draining me like you drained my car. Vanessa, I am not supposed to interfere with your emotive response, but I do think you may be overreacting. I'm overreacting. Me? This is not about me, this is about you. You drained my car and you forced us to go into a vehicle with a stranger! We don't know him. And now, he knows where we're staying, he has my car. We will be safe. You don't know that, Jen! I apologize. Thank you. We could eat something. Eating is the best. Sit. Relax. Take a sip of-- What is that? Vodka and tequila. Okay, take a sip of your vodka and tequila. I will create a snack. I'm sorry. I think that that guy just um, really freaked me out. And um-- Stop it. Stop! I know you were just trying to help with that candy face. I thought that would make you happy. Because Jennifer used to do it for me when I was sad. You have that memory. I know, but... You're not Jennifer, are you? I am not. I think in that moment I just realized that... Jennifer's never gonna make me one of those stupid faces again. We're never gonna do anything together again. We were supposed to get rich together and go to France and Australia together. Our kids were supposed to fall in love with each other. We're supposed to grow old and go flirt with the servers at IHOP for free stuffed French toast. She's never coming back. You were not going to do any of that. What? You were not going to grow old together. What are you talking about? You were going to have an argument. I don't understand. Can you see the future or something? Yes. You would have fought. You would have fought at this event. So, what? We would have fought at this event and then we would have gotten over it. No. You would have never seen each other again. You said he wasn't gonna come back to kill us. Do murderers usually ring a doorbell? Who is it? DJ Twisted Bristle! Yo, yo! Why am I forgetting everything? Uh, where should I set up? Uh, we don't need a DJ. I forgot to cancel you like I forgot to cancel the party. What? Yeah. I'm sorry. Oh, okay. Uh, yeah, no-- no worries. Cool. Uh, all right. Jennifer's memories indicate that DJs are fun. Yeah, but it's weird to have a DJ play for just the two of us. Oh, I got that song. Just the-- Yeah, which one do you wannna hear? The Will Smith version or the Dr. Evil and the little guy version, 'cause I got them both. No, I just meant that it's weird to have a DJ play for clearly no one. Oh, right. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Well, if you're worried about like not havin' a crowd, I can have my boys here like in 10 minutes tops. Absolutely not. Right, no, they're probably busy, so yeah. So should I go or... Have I paid you already? You did. You paid me already, but no tip, so... I do still need to study the physical effects of increased serotonin levels. I doubt a DJ is gonna to increase my serotonin levels. Oh, that's where you're wrong, because uh, you know why? I got molly. Screw it. Hell yeah! No, not inside the house. Just through the back. Hell no! Yeah. Vanessa, did you see that jacket? I did. Tiny pill with woman's name causes elation and-- Jennifer stopped doing that. Okay! This body seems to be designed for dancing. You're smiling and it looks natural! I am getting used to the bones in my mouth! Drug, am I right? Drugs! I wanna go somewhere else! Okay! Do you know about corn? The food or the band? C-O-R-N. Hmm, the food. I do know some things. I know that it's on a cob and you can pop it. We believe it is another alien species living on your planet in secret. Shit. For real? It is a theory. I'm still thirsty. Can I have that? Yes. Mm. Oh, that's awful without bread. ♪ Cut my life into pieces ♪ Is that Papa Roach? ♪ This is my last resort ♪ Did you do this?

I wanna go with you anywhere. You left this at my house. I was supposed to give it back before the burial. I'm sorry, Jen. It's okay. I want you to have it now. Are you sure? No one has ever given me anything. It feels... I feel... I don't know. I never experienced emotions. No one on my planet has. It is believed to be the reason we are ahead of your species. Jen, you totally have feelings, but something about your planet doesn't let you access them. Damn. That's some good molly. Perhaps coming here has developed emotions in me. How does it feel to feel the feelings? I do not have the words to explain. Yeah, I don't know either. Vanessa, I just remembered the sun will rise and set again tomorrow. Yeah. It does that every day. That is my favorite part about it. Yo, yo, yo-- oh, you're asleep. I'm gonna head out, all right? Glad you had a good time. I'm gonna take my mic. Make sure you like me on Instagram, right, at DJ Twisted Bristle. All right, I left some stickers out on the table. You'll find them. Jen? Jennifer? Holy shit. Jennifer? Jen! Jen? Hello! Oh, my God. I thought you were gone. I was for a moment, but I have returned. I am sorry if I scared you. Where were you? We did not reach the store yesterday, so I went and got your soda from the store. Here is the receipt, so that you can see. Thank you. I hitchhiked there and back. I know you do not like that, so I went alone. What are your feelings? I feel great. Thank you. I feel happy that I made you happy. You made me very happy. I like that. Okay. Come on. I also bought olive oil, because I noticed I had depleted your supply. Oh, it's the house's, but thank you. Oh, they really marked up our soda. Can I try it? Yes, of course! It's the whole point. I like the flavor of cardamom. Really? Uh, Jennifer always fought me on that. Uh. So, what are we doin' today? You're gonna make me run a mile, solve a Rubik's cube? I have completed my research. You have? I finished organizing everything early this morning, so that we did not have to work and we could spend the day together before I depart this evening. Oh, right. I thought you were leaving tomorrow. No. I leave tonight at 11:32 p.m., exactly 48 hours after I arrived. Okay, but uh, we didn't meet till the next morning, so shouldn't they, I don't know, start the clock there? They do not. Why not? I do not know. You know, it's really insane what you guys do. You know, you come here and you-- you torture humans who are already going through the worst shit of their lives. It's not a good plan. You should rethink it. I did not torture you. I would never do that. Oh, are we not just um, animals at the zoo to you? 'Cause I thought that was in the presentation. You know what? You guys are like-- you're like-- you're like those people who dress like pandas to go into panda cages. I do not know who these people are. They're liars is who they are. They're lying to the pandas. I do not understand. I was truthful to you about my research. You are upset. I'm not upset! I'm just-- I'm a little upset. I just don't think that you should go yet. I must return. I have completed my assignment. No, you have not completed your assignment. You can't just figure me out in 48 hours. That's nuts. It's less than 48 hours, by the way, technically. Oh! This is just like you. This is just like you! You're always cutting corners! You're just like this! Like this. I haven't seen Two Rings on the shelves. All you did was bring me something I've seen a million times and some trash. I did not think about that. Yeah, you don't think. This is exactly why I didn't take that distribution deal six years ago. You feel guilt? We could have had this party six years ago! We could have been doing business together for six years! And maybe... What are you saying? That she would have lived? Maybe she would have had enough money for good health insurance, and she could have had a physical, and they would have seen her heart. That would not have changed anything. W-- it-- it wouldn't have? You tell me. You're the one who could see the future. Would-- if we had taken the offer, would she still be alive? I do not know. I do not see the future. I lied to you. Why would you lie to me? Why would you do that? Because you were crying. Jennifer lied to you, so you would not hurt, so I lied to you, so you would not hurt. I was emotional. That is the problem. I cannot start feeling like this. What are you doing? What are you doing? I should have not allowed myself to get close to you. What-- what is that? What did you do? I have some in my superiors to retrieve me. They will reward me for completing my assignment early. Reward you with what? An extra vitamin injection? Maybe! Turn it off! No! Cancel it! It cannot be cancelled! We were gonna hang out! We have like eight more hours, that's a lot. I am sorry! Jennifer, don't do that, please. I am not Jennifer. What are you doing? Your efforts are futile. Not going home! It is indestructible. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Check this out. No! No! The device is programmed to return to me. That's a stupid thing for your device to do and you're a-- you're a stupid alien. That is the last thing you want to say to me? No! No! I also want to say, "F you and F your planet!" Wait! No! No, no, no! What are you doing? No, don't take her yet. Vanessa, that is an airplane from Earth. Sorry. I'm sorry. I ruin everything. I should have just spent the day with you. I have regrets as well. I reacted impulsively. I wish I had not summoned them early. I messed up with Jennifer. I should have had more fun with her when she was here. Said "yes" more. She loved you, Vanessa. It is not complicated to see why. I know she loved me. We would have been best friends forever. Would you like to hug Jennifer one last time? Jennifer is gone. They will be here soon. Are you sure you can't stay? I am sure. But now, I look forward to seeing the sunset on my own planet. Now, I have to lose you. What we once enjoyed, we can never lose. All that we love becomes a part of us. Wait here. I wanna grab something, so you don't forget me. Shit. Oh, my God. Hey, sorry, I missed your FaceTime. I was practicin' the bass, but is-- is everything okay? I was thinking we should throw a party. A-- a party? Yeah. Um, something to celebrate Jennifer's life. Yeah. O-- okay. Y-- you sound really good. Yeah, I'm okay. You sure? I'm sad, but I'm okay. ♪ Cut my life into pieces ♪ ♪ This is my last resort ♪ ♪ Suffocation, no breathin' ♪ ♪ Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleedin' ♪ ♪ Bleedin' ♪ ♪ This is my last resort ♪ ♪ This is my last resort ♪ ♪ Losin' my sight, losin' my mind ♪ ♪ Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine ♪ ♪ Losin' my sight, losin' my mind ♪ ♪ Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine ♪ ♪ Nothing's alright ♪ ♪ Nothin' is fine ♪ ♪ I'm runnin' and I'm cryin' ♪ ♪ Cut my life into pieces ♪ ♪ This is my last resort ♪ ♪ This is my last resort ♪ ♪ This is my last resort ♪ ♪ This is my last resort ♪ ♪ Oh, this is my last resort ♪ ♪ Oh, this is my last resort ♪ ♪ This is my last resort ♪ ♪ This is my last resort ♪ ♪ This is my last resort ♪ ♪ This is my last resort ♪
