I'll do it now. We'll communicate through channel eight. Thyagu, will the Government give the money we demand, in three hours? We're not going to ask the Government. We're going to execute in that mall. It shouldn't be missed. We know every hook and corner. There is no place not known to us. It's there! There is a place not known to anyone. Where? South India's Shah rukh khan. Babu! This is the secret spot found by this Usain Bolt. Where? Here it is! Come on, Babu! Please, welcome. (Liquor consumption is injurious to health) - Bolt! - Yeah. It looks big! Dude, our work schedule will be hectic. So, we need a cool spot to rest, isn't it? Better, go to GH mortuary and sleep. That's always housefull. They'll demand bribe. That's why, I made this. Silku.... What are you searching for? You said, it's like your home, So searching whether you hid your children here? But not seen anywhere. As my children didn't take care of me, I've joined here as a security. So only you ve drunk? This mall is everything for me. Those who visit the mall are my children. The kids are my grandchildren. - Nehru uncle, - Tell me, brother. I know you've sentiments. But, a request. It should be the last, calling me as, 'brother'. Why brother? You call me as brother before everyone. Girls of my age are calling me as, 'uncle'. Do you think as youth? What's wrong in calling, 'uncle'? It's a mistake only when called as,'aunty'? I'll tear your mouth. Oldey, Look back at the history. For our well being, we can serve as security anywhere. I'm back. You stand showing the back, now. I'll hit you. Are you allowing me to say a punch dialogue? Bolt, I couldn't say 'hello', though stay close? Don't worry, Babu. The situation will come on it's own for true love. Really What happened? Somebody call the doctor, please. Remove the hand. Come on, Babu. Nothing to worry. As granny was high last night, she got choking. I'll take care. Give the straw. Bolt, do you've ATM card? No, where do I have? What about Aadhar card? Fast… Take it. - It can be used for you. - No politics. Lord! She took arrack too. Get up. Medical miracle! Yes! You must marry my grand daughter. Is it? Thank you. Do you own a house? No. Then, your grand daughter must cook in my house. We'll booze together. Babu! Babu, she left half an hour ago. You're standing as if contesting elections. Was it half an hour? Yes, bro. Bolt, what's that sound like the climax in 'sultan' movie? Come, let's see. India down! down! Are you a big shot if you tuck the shirt? Trump faced? Dare to say my country as, down! My brother is coming to kick you. Sultan Babu! Who is that? "He's our warrior He's our soldier" "He is our ace fighter" How many gates we would've crossed? Get it, trump faced. Get up. I came for the sake of India. Because, it's my country. Jai hind. The America should win too. Because, it's my mother-in-law's country. Why did she throw at me? Hey, I'll go and get the cup. Don't thump my leg. Stand away. Babu! What happened? You said, a situation will come. Only dreams are coming. You're provoking everyone for long time. I'll tear your mouth. Everything has a time... The situation has come, Babu. (A musical line from the film,'Babu') Somebody stole my bag. It's the right situation. No one follow me He has to run as per the scene. Babu! Thyagu, I got the details of the card. Tell him to take the money, leave the card and bag there. Hey, you got caught! If you're dare enough, shall we fight alone? It's paining. Dude please take it. 'Undertaker' Good boy. When the love door opens, they made me to sit like this. Thank you so much. Bolt! Only now I know that undertaker knows gestures. He is enjoying. Who is the trainer for this dog? It's the pillar of 'Shaktimaan security service'. I'm the trainer! You're barking. You want to show me your trainer. Don't think, I'm giving simply bun. I'll buy a pizza for you. Pan your hand towards me. It shows somewhere! Undertaker has seen me. Come on, undertaker Quick... Come on... He came right. You saved my dignity before the white lady. Hi babu! - How are you? - I'm fine. Your dog is intelligant. You trained him well. Yeah, I'm the trainer! - I feed it with rice. - Did she ask you? Okay, see you. Bye. Does the useless black monkey needs a white lady? Drumstick, though she is a white lady, she is my love lady. Bye! Song in Pondicherry. "You're very very beautiful..." "I'm very very wonderful..." "I'll guard you in my eyes" "Come and perch in my heart" "This Gurkha has locked safely the heart's gate" "Now opened it for you" "He washed his heart with a foreign soap" "He decided to take bath everyday in the shower of love" "My white lady! You're astonishing!" "You made this ferocious lion fall for you!" "My white lady! You're awesome!" "You made this Gurkha's heart as pickles" It paired up and flew. How it flew? How it flew? "I'm going to attend the English classes from today" "I'm going to listen only the English songs" "I'm going to apply 'Fair& lovely'cream" "I'm going to eat burger and pizza" "From some edge, why did you come afore me?" "You gave confidence on love for a guy like me" "Shall we stick together like cheese on the pizza?" "My white lady! You're astonishing!" "You made this ferocious lion fall for you!" "My white lady! You're awesome!" "You made this Gurkha's heart as pickles" "Love is pure in your eyes You're very very beautiful" "I can see me, flying high I'm very very wonderful" "Come with me, hold my hands I'll guard you in my eyes" "We can dream our life in sky Come and perch in my heart" I'm here, with whom is she chatting? Give this snacks to her. - Thank you. - Let it be. Babu, Tell her. I'll tell her, no more snacks. Not that. - Then? - To marry you. Just now I befriended her. She may slap with footwear. Will you say her or shall I say? Tell her, let's see whether she understands. I'm sorry. What are you guys talking about? I'm saying you to marry him. She couldn't understand anything. See, she is blinking. I'm sorry I don't understand. What is that she saying? - He wants to marry... - Hey! I'll keep the hot vessel in your mouth. Mam, Babu wants to marry you. Really? I shut her mouth but the China boy spilled it Are you kidding, right? What's that sitting and batting? I love you. Reply me. Are you serious? I'm sorry, guys. This cannot happen. What now? I'm heavy, dark and my tress is like X-mas tree, right? Personality is the problem for you all. Not bothered about your looks, Babu. Look, Babu! These are my parents. - Is he your dad! - Yeah. Your mom is white and your dad seems to be West indies. Granny! - See, what about looks. - Superb! I like you so much, Babu. I can't marry an Indian. I hope you understand the laws. I can't marry a foreigner and leave my job. I love my job. Mam, it's getting late. We've to go. Go. Thank you, guys. Babu, why are you weeping? Where am I weeping? Granny sauted mustard seeds. It fell in my eyes. Babu, we belong to the Gurkha community. Even our wife elopes, we must be bold. I'm leaving. Babu, she didn't eat snacks. - Hello! - Congrats, mam! We're calling from 'Madras mall'. You've won 'Baahubali 3' film tickets in SRK cinemas. Not only that, you can return the tickets and shop... ...in the mall's outlets for five thousand rupees. You give the movie tickets and shopping vouchers too! Lord Muruga! Hey! - Hey! - What mom? I got 'Baahubali 3' film tickets. Free shopping for five thousand rupees. I'll give okay. Thiyagu, I've booked all the tickets. The theatre owner has blocked ten VIP tickets. As per your plan, everyone will come to the theatre. Don't know, who will be trapped in that tickets? Got trapped. The director was trapped. Boss, that's Telugu film. Do that film has expectations here? Yes, boss. Then, we'll get the stay order for that film. Because, that director is an anti-Indian. Book the ticket. Boss, as usual we're defeated in the election. We got less number of votes. The opposition party is doing campaigns, spending money for the votes. They're getting more votes, that's okay. But, who is he? Not attending campaigns, not spending money but gets more votes than us. Enquire about him. Go... Is the ticket ready? - Yes, boss. - Superb. We'll start the protest. Which party is he saying about? It's not the party. That goof is saying NOTA as a party. (A+B)² is not equal to A²+B² +2AB Boss, give me your ears. A new film is to be released. Taken video of it? Not your movie, it's Baahubali 3. Who is the heroine? Tammanah and Anushka. - Two heroines? - Yes. Book the tickets. Jai Mia- He is ecstatic now itself. Hello! Only Rs.30,000 is there in your account. Wait. Only Rs.29,500 should be there. Whom are you trying to cheat? Is your channel incurring loss? Isn't it known when watching our channel's programmes? We're very poor. Your black money will come out soon. Let's see, then. So, what are you doing today? Come later. Get lost. Let's go. Sir! What? 'Baahubali 3' is slated for release. We've to buy the rights. Shall I send the programme producer? Do one thing. I'll go and watch the film. Get a ticket for me. Get the ticket in VIP row, okay? Okay, sir. It's your responsibility to get your friend for that show. Hi Ram! Hi, today the movie plan is on, right? Yeah, sure. Is Priya coming? Yes, she'll be coming. Awesome! See you, then. Bye. Where's Priya? She'll join us in the theatre. We'll leave. Okay, let's go there. 'Honest lion' Brother Violent Veeramani... Long live! The future chief minister of Tamil Nadu, 'Violent Veeramani'. Long live! He looks like a petty thief in election campaign? Don't say like that, Babu. Why? He is the leader I adore. 'Violent Veeramani!' I wish to take a selfie with him at least once in my life. The world's superstar 'Brother Violent Veeramani'. Long live! I haven't booked tickets for anyone. I'll watch the film, you all can go home. I'm diabetic. I might feel hungry. Get me a biryani. Go. Boss, you would've booked five tickets. The guys are so excited. How many votes we got in the last election? Four votes. How many people are coming with us? Ten people. When the people who are with us didn't cast us the vote, Why should I buy tickets for them? The future Chief minister 'Brother Violent Veeramani!' Shall I take a selfie with you? An older fan. Take it. You shouldn't mistake if I ask you one thing? Tell me. You shouldn't deny. Shall I take a selfie like kissing you? You take it. It's the saliva! What? The saliva. It's okay. Shall I kiss you? Brother Veeramani who kissed like people's star. It's not an ordinary photo. I'll never forget this in my life. An elderly guy. -Come on. My life! My life! You dare to take a selfie knowing my arrival. The future chief minister of Tamil Nadu, violent Veeramani. Long live! What are you doing? Hey! Hi! Kalyani, is it you? - I got an offer for Rs.5000. - For me too. I like this large projection screen. We should get a Studio like this. Brother, third row. Be seated. Brother, biryani is not available. The food court was closed. Let it be. Give the side dish. Where is Priya? Yeah, she'll be coming. Is she here or not? Yeah, almost. Babu, why are looking dull? That's how my face is. Shut up. You're worried as that girl left with the guy. Come along. I'll buy alcohol. You're speaking like a youth at late night. We'll go outside the mall, booze and be flattened. All the shops were closed, sir. Only one show is going on in SRK cinemas. Else, all the shops are closed. No one come against us, Thiyagu. The entire mall is under our control. Sir, terrorists have intruded in Madras mall. They all have guns. They pushed us out. All sit quiet. It's not my motive to kill anyone. If you listen me, everyone will be in home by four hours. If anyone think of escaping, I'll shoot all. You mean a lot to us, Margaret, Priya is safe. The city commissioner must come here in ten minutes. Exorbitant feeling! A clan is before us with fear. The police force who should save them is standing out like dog. Either to save or kill them, is my own decision. Only my decision. None other than me. (Liquor consumption is injurious to health) (Song from Tamil movie 'Velaikkaran') The familiar mall in Chennai is hijacked by the terrorists. Usually, the people will be hijacked. But, here the mall is hijacked. Didn't you watch the English films? The terrorists will hijack only the malls. That's their style. Look at the fun. It looks like our mall. It's our mall, only. Among the hostages caught inside, the American ambassador is also there. The terrorists are yet to reveal their demands. Hey Bolt! My love lady was caught inside. Babu! It's the right time. Immediately we'll tie the rope and will exit towards the back door. Hey senseless, my love lady was caught inside. You're saying that we'll escape tying the rope. Ten thousand lives are there with belief on us. What are you saying, Babu? It's you who told that all the people who come here are your life. Did I say so? Aren't you ashamed to escape being born in this country? Have you seen the film, 'Agni IPS'? I saw in this TV. That's why you didn't feel it's energy. I'll elate the energy now. Bolt! You must show your strength to the guy who hit and pushed you out. - Are you ready? - Ready. Good! Everyone is going to witness who is this Hussian bolt. Come on, babu Let's attack I was tired as you spoke with me. The antagonist in the mall is powerful. How perfect we do will result in fault. The way he did unexpectedly, we too should do the same. What to do, Babu? I'll tell you. Come on. (Liquor consumption is injurious to health) Why are giving key to the watch? What plan Babu? This world have seen both of us as comedians. Just see, how the perspective on us changes after this. Cant understand? Who is he laughing at? I'm waiting. Thiyagu, we've only ten walkie- talkies. Now, the eleventh frequency is switched on. Everyone switch off your walkie-talkie. Now play it. Thiyagu, I feel something is wrong. Who is he? Sir, a roaring sound of an animal is heard. Goof! The way he did unexpectedly, we too should do the same. But, at the moment of tension, the Chinese will do one thing. Power nap... Sleeping for minutes to relax the mind. (Liquor consumption is injurious to health) Dileep, I must know where the... ...eleventh frequency walkie-talkie is working? She too irates. Good evening, sir. Dhanraj, are you good? Getting salary on time? Sir! Were you tweaking when someone was hijacking the mall? Sir, that is... Hang up the call, damn it. Whom are you saying? I said my wife, sir. My party office is next to the mall. My party people won't respect me. Moreover, they've abducted the foreigner too. I'm getting pressure from the Central Government. See, it should be the headlines in tomorrow's dailies... ...as this operation was done by my Government. You gun them down. I'm not bothered of the public, if they die. It must be done in an hour. Else, run away. I'm giving the entry. Babu! Shall we start the mission? Many lives are awaiting for us to save. Okay, how long will it take to finish the mission? We both can finish it in three hours twenty minutes. If our concentration doesn't shatter. Right, if our concentration shouldn't shatter... ...it's not enough to be clear only in mind, Even the stomach should be clear. Fabulous, Babu! I'll finish this duty and go ahead of that. Intense planning, Babu. We'll make them die. Why did you put a hole in this? Babu, you look handsome even in toilet. Damn it. Shut your mouth. Babu, we'll go. Wait for two minutes. Stay there. No, Babu. Be quiet. Stay there. We thought that hijacking the mall is too tough. But the securities here are stupid. Babu, they comment bad about our job. Be quiet. Else, they might shoot. Listen me. The securities are old people. That's why, it was easy to hijack. Babu, they're speaking bad about my age. I can't control myself. He too. Bolt, listen to me. They'll shoot you. Be quiet. None of the security is inside. Only four oldsters are there. We outsted them. No one is there. Though they're here, they might be hiding somewhere in the washroom. Cowards! Hey! Where are you going? Whom you said as cowards? My brother, 'lion Babu' is in this washroom. Our dog, 'undertaker' is there. Come over us, if you've courage. Come on. Got caught? Boss, don't shoot me for the words of the oldey. I'm youngster, still. Only my tress is more, not my age. Please, don't shoot. I'll not leave you. - I'll kill you. - No, sir. Oh, no! Ungrateful dog! Instead of saving me, are you hiding behind the door? Get lost. Babu! I'm suppressing for a long time. I can't. Shall we visit the washroom again? Hey! I'll bang you. I'm standing before the hijacked,'Madras Mall'. The Chennai City Commissioner Mr. Dhanraj, has come to the mall accepting... ... the demands of the terrorists. The situation is tense here. Let's see, what's the next action of the police. No one can enter from the neighbouring buildings, right? Are the drones are in position? Be alert, guys! Just stand. Shouldn't move still I call. Hi, sir. Is it him? He'll kill by shouting. Sir, I'm 'duty bound, Harris Jayaraj'. I'm sincere and serious but you aren't panic. Sir, Thoothukudi boys are here. Shall I call them? We can finish the job smoothly. Order now, sir. Be quiet. Let's ask their demands, first. Then we'll decide about shooting. It's an old formula. Is it a walkie-talkie? Speak now. Speak. I'm the City Commissioner, Dhanraj. Tell me, what are your demands? I must know the situation of the hostages. They didn't respect. Sir, give the order. We'll shoot them and go. - It's waste - How if you stay silent? Only we can negotiate if known about your demands. They didn't respect. Shameless! Pass the order, sir. one second. Only once. Pass the order, sir. Boys are waiting, sir. - Okay. - Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. Boys, come on. Hurry up. These are my yellow boys, sir. Why are they wearing T-shirts when on duty? Sir, we wear each colour for every operatiom. Except the white. Because, the public will think of us as doctors. They're also my boys. Harris, a big shot! Hey, why is he climbing on the van? I'm ready for shoot out, sir. That's habitual, sir. If they see the van they'll climb, sir. Instead, they'll shoot the public. They'll shoot. Pass the order, sir. Don't shout. Press people are there. Boys, wait. Guys, damn sure your guns have work. - Be confident. - Don't shout. Be quiet for sometime. I'm already quiet. He might've born for walkie-talkie. Hello, we can't be patient, henceforth. If you don't reply, no other way except the shooting order. Yeah, plead kneeling down to him. Can you hear me? No way except the shooting order. - They keep talking and not listening. - Can you hear me? Hey, a person is shouting there but you aren't saying about your demands. Hello! Do you know whose wife I'm? Give me the order. Okay, go ahead. Thank you so much, sir. Boys, come fast. Give the gun. Shoot them. Harris! The casualties must be minimal. Sir, to save hundred people, it's okay to kill ten people. 1:10...the Government will not bother, leave it. Take the guns. The hands are itching. Tell me, Kalyani. Shoot without getting confused. I want the photo in the daily, that's all. What are you saying? Get lost. Abort the operation. Why are you saying to abort the operation? Don't you like us getting an award? Not only the public... ... even my wife is inside. Is it? Tell me, sir. I'll go and hit, immediately. What? No, sir. I'll bang the abductor of your wife. Abort the operation. Why should we abort the operation? What do we say when taking the oath? What do you say? What do we say when taking the oath? We'll never leave our duty for the sake of Kith and kin. For the sake of your wife, you want to leave our duty. Don't shout, my ears are getting hurt. My heart is heavy, sir. Why is he shouting? Will he watch director Hari's films? Gayathri, I'm in an important operation. I'll come in half an hour. Don't come, dear. I'm your husband, who will come other than me? Myself and Karunakaran came to watch the film in the mall. We were cheated by the Rs. 5000 offer. The terrorists are threatening with the guns. I'm afraid. Rs.5000 offer! If she had asked me the money, I would've sent her immediately by the app in my cellphone. Greedy of the offer given by someone and taken as hostage, She is pleading to save, now. How to save you? Get lost. There isn't shoot out, sir? My wife is blabbering there. You ask for the shoot out. The Commissioner Dhanraj is mere waste. If I had the power, I would've attacked and not bothered about wife. Rosemary! Sir, it was well executed. The City Commissioner and his four Assistant Commissioners, The Area Police Inspector, Sub-Inspector and the Constables families were hijacked. Don't know what to do! It'll take five hours for the NSG commandos to reach. Before that, I must show that my Government has done this operation. Sir, what I say... You'll get the letter from IG by fax. Sir! Sir, shooting order. Do we fear of terrorists? No, sir. I'm the lion. - See now, I'll sign it. - Sign it, sir. Oh, no! Maragadham, are you inside? Sir, sign it. I'll hit you. Commissioner sir, shall we talk about the demands now? An account number will be displayed in the screen, out of the mall. In ten minutes, Rs.10,000 should be deposited in that account. Rs.10,000! How much? Rs.10,000 from the account of the Government officials. I'll repeat, Rs.10,000 from your Government officials account. Your time starts now. Sir, he said as Rs.10,000, right? Yes. Sir, what's this? That's my daughter's popcorn expense. He must be a psycho. We would've given if he asked for ten lakhs also. But, just Rs.10,000. Okay, wait. Fine, give them my ATM card. Let them swipe it. It has limit of Rs.50,000. It has to be done officially from the Government account. What's that official? Give immediately to the Chief secretary. You're talking to those who disrespect you. Shut up. Hello, just a minute. Sir, from which funds to allocate the money? Was it a huge money? Give it from the party's fund. Sir, the terrorists will hack the account and will swindle the entire money. Oh, no! What to do now? Sir, shall we open a new account? It's good to connect the Central finance minister. Hello. No response from the Government after six minutes... ...for their demand of Rs.10,000. Only four minutes left! If the PM issues order, I can release the money. Good! we don't know each other's languages. What to do now? Hey, Rs.10,000 What? Rs.10,000. Even if it's just Rs. 10,000, I can give only by the order of the PM. Should I ask the PM for money? Shall we ask the PM of Canada? He looks like actor, Aravind swami. He might give. Sir, ten minutes was over. As the time given by the terrorists was elapsed, A video is playing on the LED screen, Let's see, what it is! Commissioner sir, your Government couldn't give just Rs.10,000. It's of absolutely no use talking with you. Now, I place my demands to the public. In two hours, two hundred crore rupees should be deposited in that account. The LED screen will display the deposited money. Let's see, whether you a ll join together... ...to save the human life as you did for bullfight. You shouldn't think I'm playing or I won't do anything. Two hours and two hundred crores. Your time starts now. You coward! He did not deserve this. Who do you think you're? Bolt, take the walkie-talkie. Thyagu, the eleventh frequency is still on activation. (Devotional song) Praise Lord Muruga! No one can do us anything till the spiritual politics exists. Hey, monkey cap... I'll pray to the lord and kill you. Hey, hit me straight if you're dare enough. If you dare, take away the cap and come out. Hey, you don't know who am I? That's why, I told you to remove your cap. okay, I'll make sure that you'll never see sunshine again. - Could you understand? - No Then, why did you speak in English? Speak in Tamil. I won't spare you. Could you understand? Hey, catch me if you can. What's this? Only nine lakh rupees was deposited in an hour. Sir, that money wasn't deposited by the public. I begged everyone in our department. The money will not get deposited, hereafter. My dear son and Gayathri will be killed. Your carelessness. Hey! Be no more! What's your security services name? What's the name? 'Shaktimaan'. You look like the music director, Anirudh's uncle. 'Shaktimaan'. Hey, leave it. Bolt, as he wasn't near, I told punch dialogues. I'm afraid he might do anything. No use of being afraid. We both can't do anything. See, I'll call now. He can't communicate now. If he speaks on walkie-talkie, we can find out by frequency. The jammer is still on . They can't speak on the phone. Babu, there is no signal on the phone. The terrorists have used jammer. We lost our hope. See now. It's my grandfather's phone. If it's taken even to Himalayas by Rajini sir, it'll have signal. Grandpa, you never gave me anything so far. Will you give the signal? Grandpa! Surprised! Babu! Hello, Mr.Kavariman. Are you inside? Don't blabber. Irritating me. A guy from Shaktimaan security service is inside. Sir! Hey constable. Sir. Get me an apple juice. Okay, sir. Babu... We've to save everyone here. First, save yourself. Give the phone to someone nearby. Give me the phone. Will you speak only to me? Hey goof, give the phone to someone who is good. Sir, he'll speak only to me. Because, only we know the entirety of the mall. Ask him about the status inside, instead you're speaking something else. Idiot. Cool, sir! Babu, how many people are there, what weapons do they've? As they're wearing the masks we couldn't identify them. Send us a photo in order to identify them. Hey, Palmyra tuber. Are we here for wedding? We're trapped by terrorists. You're asking for photos. Give the phone to someone. Okay, you call later. Shaktimaan sir, if can't get the photo of the terrorist... ...please, show me the photo of your security. I'll touch his feet if you show his photo. Please, show me. You'll faint, if you see him. My life is stuck there, is fainting an issue? Please, show me. Then, look here. Look at the beauty. Is he, really? Yeah, he is. It's over. Sir! The terrorists may leave if given money. But, he won't. We've planned and abducted these people. Where are those ten VIPs who trapped on their own? Here, they're. - You're an anti-Indian. - Shut your mouth. We'll make our Tamil Nadu blossom. I'll tear the mouth. By blowing air, we'll make it to blossom. - Shut your mouth. - Okay, sir. How to do Ranjitha? - Okay, swamiji. - See there, what is he doing? Hey, what are you doing? How dare you touch him? Wow! How they speech? Hey, are you telecast that swamiji video? Hey! This is a real gun! I'm sorry. I just came to buy the film rights. Hereafter, I'll not come even to watch. Everything is okay. Who is the last ticket? It's he wearing the blue shirt. Oh, no! Is he? The film I came to watch is 'Baahubali' When looking at the incidents they resemble the hijackers in the film "Die hard" Let's wait and see, from where did they stole the story. Thyagu, thirty minutes over. We must change the place. (Islamic devotional song) Hey gorilla, I got the blessings from Allah. You'll be panicked. I'm coming out, now. Catch me, if you're courageous. "Dialogue used in the film Baahubali" Damn it. Bolt! - Yeah, - They think only I'm here. Yes. Don't call me as Babu, from today. Why, Babu? That is, Bahadur Babu! Sir, he came out. Going inside the toy store in the second floor. "It's not the game playing with you and me" "You'll run away if caught in trap" "Not a person to abduct with plans" "I'm not bothered about pack of jackals" Hey, you got caught. Sir, he is an oldey, who tensed us. What to do with him? Finish him. We struggled to hijack, you dare to tense us? You oldey. Hey, was it a gun or feeding bottle? You're keeping that in mouth? "I'm the champ and the paladin, don't bother me" "Don't blow the conk which doesn't have life" If you go that way, I'll yell lewd at you. "Don't blow the conk which doesn't have life" He listens to the dolls. Must be lunatic. Hey, turn aside. Get it. Is it done? It's done. Two opening batsmen in your team was done. Thyagu, now he is walking in the second floor. Send the drones close to him. Hey half baked, my flying squad is coming now. "You try to elevate threatening with gun and girl" "You're playing game with me" "You search after letting me to run" "I'll get trapped and unite with you" You were roaming without my knowledge. Now all my eyes are on you. What are you going to do, joker? I'll escape, you dobber. You hijacked the mall with these bats, right? I'll pierce your eyes out. I'll destroy your technology with my blackmagic. Thyagu, this goof is saying, he'll destroy our technology by witchcraft. Thyagu, he is doing something. Thyagu! Hey Thyagu! he is doing something more than the human power. Hey, goof by birth. Hey lunatic, I'm the witchcraft. Oh, no! "You scrolled and intimidated, sculptured and frightened me" "Don't chase me forward..." If I don't break it, our people will thrash. It's too height. Let me try. "Stop and hold me..." "Don't make my worth to weigh less" Babu, save me. I can't hit it. Sorry, I can't hit. What? To them, it was me who made tensed. They'll pound me. Save me, Babu. Undertaker! Come on. Lazy dog. Will you come in 48 frames? Come soon. Hey, waste of your drones. If you've a family, run away. Else... My mouth hurts, shall I speak later? What? Are all the cameras broken? Ranju, what happened to Pappu? He started celebrating, all of the sudden. He doesn't like cameras. He is happy as it was broken. What? - Come on baby. - Was the camera broken? He is saying something. Find them, he'll come on his own. Boss, will the money be deposited? Have trust. Trust is life. People have voted for us. Only four people voted for us. Mam, is sir inside? We've lot of money, we can send mam. Only yesterday the raids were conducted. If we send money now... Instead of coming home, he'll go to prison. The disciples of the priest will send the money. Nobody need to deposit the money. Just now, god spoke to me by telepathy. His power will be beatified, vanish from the mall and reach here. Doesn't it seem to be superfluous for you? This is the right chance for me to occupy his position. Let him die there. Dad, where are you going? I'll deposit the money in ATM. They're struggling inside. Why are you doing unwanted things? The rich people will take care of. You come and sit. Bolt, have you sent the doll? Yes, it had reached the police too. Bolt, shall we tease the joker? - Definitely. - See now. Thyagu, NSG commandos might've started. Only two hours left. We'll finish this mission… …and leave this place before the police identify us. Before they get our details... ...we will leave this country. They can't find even our name. Thyagu! It's over! He has finished our story. He took a photo. Only you're visible. My face is not seen. "Ask and it'll be given to you Seek and you'll find" "Knock the door, it'll be opened for you". Even Lord Jesus will give only when asked. But, you posed without asking. Are you getting frustrated? You abducted my life. You'll see the hell, hereafter. Sir, last year with ten kgs of plastic explosives... ...an ISIS team campaigned. Among them nine people were arrested in tirupur. Yes. He is the left out. He used Major Thyagarajan's house. But, he died. He is using the Major's identity. Sir, the number they display is an International account. There is the possibility that the whole amount will go to some terrorist group. Commissioner sir! Hope you can judge me, now. This car blast is to show what I can do. Just 50gms of explosives were used. I've huge quantity. If any one tries to enter the mall, the whole mall will be shattered. If you've an idea of shoot out and diffuse the bomb I don't have the bomb, It's placed somewhere in the mall. Instead of thinking foolishly, Pray god that money should be deposited in the account. - Nothing has happened to anyone, right? - No, sir. Thyagu, why didn't you tell about the car blast to me? Already two lives were lost. No life should be lost, hereafter. Where did you keep the explosives? We guarded our people from the border. I am also worried about that lost lives. No other way. No loss of life, hereafter. I don't have the explosives. The NSG will hesitate to enter the mall, only if we threaten so. Just try to understand. Move a little. It was you who leaked out my video, isn't it? Is that important now? The urban naxals, in my office... ...my emploees, do you know what they'll be doing now? Must be celebrating with my photo. Let them enjoy. Hey, What did you do? Sir didn't die yet. He is alive. The media buff will post the videos of anyone before their demise. Babu, a bomb is placed in the mall. Let it be. They want you, the Shaktimaan staff to find it out. Who? me? Hundred police personnels were deployed. They want you to do what they can't. I said the bomb wire! Thyagu, I found the person who made us tensed. There is something more than his life. If he hear the screamings, he will come on his own. Hey, joker! Tell me. I'm aware for whose sake are you doing this. If you don't come here in one minutes. Your life will not be alive. Get lost. Do anything you want. I feel sleepy. Lost, everything is lost. What that foreign girl did to you? Babu, are you stone hearted? You must be there to save your love lady. - Bolt! - Yeah. They haven't done anything to Margaret. Then, who was banged? Your life! If you're thrashed, he'll come out. Tell me, where is your guy? Why are you hitting me? Your liver will be damaged. If we got you, he'll come out. Hey goof, I doesn't know about him. Then, what it means? This is not me. It's graphics. Someone did the morphing. Are you telling lies? - I'm not lying. - Breathe no more. Sir, I consciously told lie. My head brought me up like that. I ask you for apology. Those who speak against them will be said as anti-Indian. When the real anti-Indian bangs them, they'll fall on the foot. Bolt, to find out the bomb... Babu should get surrendered. Babu. are you going to get caught on your own? Why should I get caught? For them, you're Babu! You get surrendered. A musical line from the film,"Karnaa" Ranji! Lord...Lord... What? Tell me clearly. Where is my life? Oh, are you asking about my devotee? He was banged. Banged? My life! My life! Who are you? Don't you know me? No. Open the eyes and see me. It's not an ordinary photo. I'll never forget this in my life. I too can't forget that photo. Whenever there is a lag in the screenplay, an old villan enters. Don't know which lunatic will come now.

We've to send metal detectors for lunatics. Sir, the bag is not going up. How will it go? - Did you keep what he asked? - What's that, sir? Keep the bun-butter-jam and see how it goes. Don't scratch. Keep it soon. See, how it goes. He must be extremely hungry. - Hello, my child. - Tell me, father. Have you ate the bread? Ate and had a nap. I'm saying in my ten years of experience, the bomb will be kept only in the toy shop. The toy shop is in the second floor. Go there, immediately. - No, I'm in the third floor. - So? There is no A.C in the second floor, so I'm going to third floor. What now? Tell me, if there is any job in third floor. I'll do it. If not here, I'll think and tell you whether to come to the second floor. Search it. A musical line from the film the,"3" My child! Tell me, father. According to the bomb detector, If the signal is green, you're safe. If the signal is red, you're close to the bomb. If it signals the pink light? Pink light? - Is there a pink light? - Nothing like that, sir Nothing like that. Hey, lunatic... If you asked me, I would've told myself... ...as there is no pink color. RDX, I just checked whether you're credible or deceptive? Did you understand? Babu, the life of the public is in your hands. Did you find the bomb? Won't I give it, If I find? Sir, I've found out.

Why are my hands turning black? Oh, is it grease? Oh, no! it'll slip. My aunt! Oh, my goodness! just missed. Idiots, kept it like a sweet box. How to take this upstairs?

Even if this world turns against you. Until you accept it. Whoever, wherever, forever... A musical line from the film,"Jithan" Hey... He told he found the bomb. But he didn't ask about the wire to cut. Oh, god! I can't. My chest is paining. Oh, no! RDX, are you calling at this time? Hello! Babu! I got struck. Who will save me? Undertaker, come on.

How did you escape from me? Wait, I'll come. Sir, our drone vision was disconnected. - Don't know what happened? - It's all over. Where did you send? To the terrace. Then, it's not disconnected. I asked babu to come to terrace with the bomb. He might've hit that. - Hey, RDX. - Tell me, child Babu, you've to diffuse the bomb. Listen to me, carefully. Is any time displayed in that? It's 3.30. Snow is falling. Why are you killing me? Babu, I'm not asking about the watch, It's about the bomb. In the bomb? They have not inserted the battery, so no time is shown. Yes, it's not a time bomb as we think. It's a normal bomb. - Babu, do you've the cutter I sent? - Yes. - There'll be a green wire in the bomb. - Yes, I've cut it. - Have you cut it? - Oh, no! - Let's run. - Be quiet. Why are you panicking us? I was about to say not to cut it. What are you doing? I'm a fast worker, you've to tell swiftly. Hey, what's this? The timer started after cutting the wire. He converted the normal bomb to time bomb. What's the time shown? Time? One..two..three.four... - It shows four seconds. - Four seconds! - Oh, my god! - No... It's shows four minutes. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hey, I'm telling you the time and you thank Jesus. - Babu. - Tell me. Check is there any black wire? A black wire? It's not seen. Check, there'll be a black wire. No. Open the eyes and see. Yes, it's there. Yes, cut it off. - Yes, I've done it. - Have you done it or not? Yes, I've done. Babu, did you cut the black wire or not? Yes, I've done. Babu, did you cut the black wire or not? Yes, I've done. Hello! Babu, did you cut the black wire or not? Can you hear me or not? As if i'm a speed worker, doing silly mistakes. Did you cut the black wire or not? Sorry sir, it's technical fault. Instead of the bomb wire, I've cut the earphone wire. How did you take him for job? That's nothing, sir. One day, he came to the office and lifted the water can. So, I've appointed him. He is a good body builder. Babu, how many seconds left? Sir, twenty seconds left. Oh, no! Babu, there'll be a red wire. cut it off. Are you a ballon seller? Please cut it off, babu. Wait. I've cut it off. Was it switched off? It's going on high speed. Babu, what's the time shown now? Time? It shows only ten seconds. Sorry, Babu. Your try is over. I'll give you the bun-butter-jam finally, as you wish. It's better to die than to live with you. Blast now. It's all over, Babu. Six... five... four.. three…two..one… Babu! Brother, Babu! Are you there, my child? Excellent, undertaker! My dear child! RDX, I diffused the bomb. Great! Oh, my god! Superb, Babu! How? That's Babu! Bahadur Babu! Hey, be silent! Why the dog is barking when praising you? Nothing, we are shivering. Will you send us black coffee? Else, I'll stick back the detached wire. They don't have visibility now and no bomb threat for us too. So, it's the right time for the operation. And the sniper team has arrived, sir. A cellphone signal was connected before five minutes and later disconnected. Another thing, only one hour is left. We didn't get the demanded amount. I'm afraid, we might lose. We aren't here to lose. I got the clear shot, sir. Snippers have sourrounded us. Hey, my son! - He is a small boy. - Mom, please save me. Thyagu, I won't be quiet, still. Leave the child. Maran, listen to me. Enough of the collected money. Come, let's go. This is the last casualty. I'm telling you. We struggled only for money. Only, I know how to get the money. If anybody hinders the plan... Mom, I'm afraid. Hey, No! Mom, I'm afraid. Commissioner sir, ask all the media to cover up. The time given to you is over. - I need the money... - Listen to me. Mom! If anyone comes close, trying to save him... - No one will be left alive. - Wait. Don't be hurry. Dad, save me. Whose child is that? Tell me, whose child? My kid, sir. My kid, sir. Somehow, save him. If anything happens to him, my wife will die inside and I'll die here. Why they made the child hang? Even actor Vishal can't save him. What's this, undertaker? They did like this! What to do? Searching. Hey, I'll show who this Bahadur Babu is? Come on. Dad, where are you going again? Just now, I told you not to go. You may think, it's someone's child. But, he looks like our Ashwin to me.

I'm going to save that child. I don't know will I see you or not. Gulbir thapa! Grandpa! Oh, no. Mom! Save me! Look there, the spider man! Save me! I can't. It's paining. Why are you looking at me as if in butcher shop? Save me! Sir! what happened? Sir, the money getting deposited is stopped. What are you saying? The server has crashed as multiple transactions were done for the same account. Nothing can be done. Thyagu, the money getting deposited is stopped. Is this is how the people of Tamilnadu have concern on a life? Uncle, don't leave. Uncle, I'm afraid. Uncle, don't leave. Let's have a talk, whatever it is. Take the child inside. Listen to me. Uncle, no... Uncle, don't leave me. I'm sorry, Commissioner sir. I'm not responsible for the child's death. It's you and your people. Don't ever blame me. Mom! Harris, look there. Look there. My kid! He saved him. Hi! What is your father's name? Aah, animation doll! Sorry, we don't even know your name. Thank you very much for dragging us inside. Do you've the phone? Here it is. Don't talk for long time. Only three rupees left. Please, untie the knot. The blood circulation was stopped. Sorry, sir! I thought him as an ex-serviceman, and started this mission. If known that he is a ISIS terrorist, I would've killed him at first. Tell me, what I must do now? Untie the knot. Else, speak. Shall we them immediately, getting inside? How are the possibilities? If we step closer, nearly 20 to 30 casualties are possible. Okay, what to do now? - There is a plan, sir. - What's the plan? With no casualties. But, it can't be done from outside. Can do it from inside. What's that? In 2002, in Russia, a terrorist group hijacked a theatre... Ask the commissioner to recharge after speaking. Using the A.C vent, they spread the anesthesia in theatres. Then, the terrorists and the hostages fainted in the theatre. The Russian army took over them. Okay, but where to get large amount of anesthesia immediately? Sir, a dental clinic is there in second floor of this mall. The chemicals used for local anesthesia... ...is in the maintenance room along with the gas cylinders. We can use the chemicals and the gas. How much money is transferred so far? Ninety crores of rupees. Transfer to this account, immediately. Whose account is these? Do what I say, don't ask questions. - Come on, boy. - I'm coming. - Hey. - Yes. Connect this gas cylinder to the A.C vent... ...and pour the chemical in it. Again, I'm telling you, we must pour the chemical in the A.C vent. I'm experienced in pouring out. Won't I do this? Don't say perfections just because you saved me. - Yes, give me the bottle. - Take it. Hey, why did you break the bottle? It's just plain water. He told to pour this in the vent. You're farting, right? Not to stuck, he told to pour the water. It won't stuck. Leave it. Is it? Yeah, I scored centum in Physics. What to do with this? Throw it away and come. Go. I'm listening to you as you're an educated. Come on. Why Napoleon is giving action and reactions? Have you connected everything perfectly? Yes, perfectly done. No terrorist will escape. All gone. Sir, we've connected the gas cylinder to A.C vent. In two minutes, everyone will be fainted. - They've to. - Be ready, sir. Sir, the phone is mine. Give me. Don't even have a phone. Have you done it perfectly? We've done. You're worst. You gave a cylinder of your height. But, why did you give the water in the bottle? You would've given in a can. He broke it. - Hey! - What? Hey, that's not water. It's chemical. Chemical? Dumphead, did you pour it properly or not? Where to pour? He broke it well before. Hey, you broke it and said as water. But, it's a chemical. Hey buffalo, when you didn't know, How could I know, being a child? You said, you're the centum scorer. 'I'm a little star' 'I'll be a super star' - I'm actor Simbu's fan. - I'm actor Vishal's fan. Shut up. Sir, don't mistake me as I repeatedly ask you. Was that a chemical? How many times to tell you? That's a chemical. Sir, what will happen there? - I can't bear, sir. - Get lost. Get lost. I plead you. You're banging me in mouth. You're the reason for everything. - Kill you. - No need, sir. What are you enacting? What are you doing? Why are you laughing? Sir, I hear only the death squads. Everyone is weeping. Why are you laughing though I hit? Sir, I'm crying, not laughing. I'll shoot you. Sir, are you a goof? If you shoot, I'll die. Don't laugh. I'll shoot you. Thyagu, everyone is laughing. Yeah, only laughing sounds are heard. Yes, sir. I'll go to the basement. Bring her and come down.. Thyagu, the police has rescued the hostages. What is the next plan? In five minutes, Nirmal will come in the back gate. By the time he reaches, money will get transferred. What to do with her? Until she is here, no one can near us. Do you think you're gonna get away from this? I'm not gonna let you go! Margaret's blood. You didn't spare even her. I'll come. I'll speak in English. Who are you? Touching the blood stained mouth. Suffering from fever... I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Like all other terrorists, you speak Hindi in the climax scene of the films. Do you think I don't know the language? I was born as a mix of North Madras and North India. I am also a Hindi guy. Shall I speak? Granny, Babu is speaking Hindi. It's not him speaking but his grandpa... A musical line from the film, "Raja Hindustani". I'll sing a Hindi song. Granny! Granny! They're hitting me. Granny, Babu is getting hit. He isn't getting hit but counting it. Hey granny, am I counting when they hit me hard? Bhajan lal! Are you cuffing my hand? I've mouth. We're the 'Avengers Gurkha'. Look here, if you wish to live, remove the rain coat and ask for apology. Hey Somersaults! Hey, it's paining. Hey, you drumstick faced... Hey! You didn't even spare the foreigner, isn't it? I'll bang you. I'll brawl with you, refreshing myself. See now. Romance with a foreigner! Margaret! Just leave him He is a lunatic Nice landing. Hey, have you seen? How I hit you like my hero Balakrishna. Why are you lying as if you're in sleeper couch? Come to brawl. Come on. Uncle! Son-in-law! Sir, we saved everyone. That girl? We saved the American woman too. Sir, only the security who helped us, died. What happened? Where is Babu? Sorry mam, he is no more. "My life... you're parted..." Babu! "My life... you're parted..." Lost your life for sake of the country. "My darling..." What an unexpected death babu? "where are you?" Who is there for us to take care? "My life... " You made us orphans, Babu. "You're receded!" "My dream, where are you?" "My life..." Oh, no! Babu. "You're parted..." The torso is vibrating. Babu! Babu! You're alive! You're alive! Didn't I die? No. What is this, Bhajan lal? Grandpa saved me. Grandpa! Hello, granny! Grandpa saved me. The terrorist shot me. He died. I'm coming home. Hang up the call. - Bhajanlal, how can I leave you? - I love you, Babu. Have to ruin many people and families, still. Babu, you're alive! It's a miracle! The police have saved all those trapped inside. We can witness their happiness. My dear! We've escaped. I'm weeping but you're laughing! What, dear? I never saw her laughing like this! Hey, I know this channel. The channel owner is with us. We'll ask about his feelings. - Sir, what about your feelings? - Hey wait, cut the camera. Incompetent fools. Is this how to ask a question? Okay, sir. At that moment, what's your feelings? Feelings! I don't have feelings. Ladies sentiment. Take her feelings. Sir, they aren't the hostages. They're mere spectators. I don't care. Take them in and after coming out, ask about their feelings. I want the feelings, now. Action! TRP! The film you watched now is "Gurkha". In this movie, a guy comes wearing a rain coat. We've to believe him as the terrorist. Then, another guy roams around as lunatic. He is going to save us. Moreover, a dog is there. And a mind voice for it. This film is said as, "comedy genre". But, nothing is there to laugh. It's good if the director learns well about the comedy genre... ...as it's good for the audience. And we'll be alive too. The big problem of this film is the 'Director'.
