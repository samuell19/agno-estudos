I wish dad was here. He would know what to do. What's the matter? It's probably nothing. I'll tell you in the car. Whoa. - Nora? - I feel dizzy, like... Norah? You okay? Thank god this place has an elevator. Well, you're the one who wanted to live on the top floor. Let's unpack. Or we could stand by the truck. And look all helpless and sexy. And wait for a couple of burly guys. To help us unpack the heavy stuff. I taught you better than that. Get your butt over here and help me. What? I thought it was a great plan. Okay, what first? Start with the box on the right. Lift with your legs. All your beautiful cups are in there. Can't we just live right here? This has the coffee pot. La-la-la! How can you have that much energy? Because it's moving day! It looks like it's really heavy. - I think you got it. - Arrgghh! - Get over here! - Uggh! Okay. Arrggh! That was a rip. So fresh. - This is heavy. - Just push the dolly, dear! I'm trying, mom. It's heavy! Seriously? How am I gonna do this? I think I'm losing my grip here, mom. Okay, okay, set it down, set it down. Ooh! Way to go, mom! Don't worry about it. Come here, come here, come here. - Lemme show you this view. - Yeah? Isn't that great? Yeah. - We live here. - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. - Back to work. - Uhn-uhn. - Mm-hm. - No! Yes! Let's go! We got boxes! Hey, mom, where do you want this? Oh no. My child can't read. Hello? Who are you and how'd you get in here? I'm Lawrence. On-site maintenance. These come with the job. I'm sorry. I'm Michelle, and this is my daughter Norah. We're moving in. I can see that. I also heard it... All the way down the hall. Again, I apologize. But you're on-site maintenance, so, great. There are a few things that management said. They were gonna take care of before we moved in, So, there is a light switch cover in my daughter's room. That's not working, And there's something wrong with that corner carpet, - It looks a little dirty. - Ma'am. And then, right here, I tried to plug... Ma'am! It's my day off. Oh. I live on-site. You want something fixed, fill out a repair request. Oh, that reminds me. They're fumigating this whole building. On October the 10th. I need this place completely cleared out that night. I thought women were supposed to be good at packing stuff. And I thought building staff was supposed to give tenants 24 hours' notice before they let themselves in a unit. I knocked first. You probably didn't hear it over all that. - Noise you were making. - Okay, Lawrence, we get it. Thank you. They're making a ton of noise. That doesn't bother you? No. I've moved before, as you know. A little noise is understandable. I'm sorry, I would have knocked too, But you probably wouldn't have heard that either. Over lawrence's barking! Just... Keep it down, all right? Welcome to the building. Thank you. I was actually about to punch him. I'm sure it wouldn't be the first time. A fist met his face. I'm helene; This is my daughter, Channing. We live down on the second floor. Yeah, right next to the laundry room. It's not that bad. - Oh, hey, lemme help you. - Oh, thanks. I'm Michelle. This is Norah. It's nice to meet you. - Single mom? - Yeah, yeah. Well, us single domestic goddesses. Have to look out for each other. So are you gonna be going to Lincoln high? Yeah. Do you go there? Yeah! I'll show you around the school. If you show me what you did to your bedroom. Yeah. Take a break. - Coffee? - Oh, would love some. That's if I can find it. So I haven't had a ton of time. To do anything to the bedroom yet, But this is it. - It's cute. - Yeah. And this bed is. Super comfortable, I'm already in love with it. This view is incredible. I know, right? My mom said that on a clear day, You can see all the way to Catalina island. I can't see anything from my bedroom. What am I saying? I don't even have a bedroom. Why is that? It's a one-bedroom condo. I sleep in the living room. It's no big deal. Hey, is that your dad? Yeah. He passed away last year, though. That's when my mom decided that we should move. To California, you know, get a fresh start. Wow. So you had to leave your high school, All your friends? I mean, I still keep up with them on social media. But, hey, it's my last year of high school, So I'm just gonna focus, work hard, get it over with. So, no partying? Not my thing. I'm shooting for an athletic scholarship. Are you sure you're not into parties? Oh, yeah, no, those are just for my migraines. 'Cause I get them really bad, To the point where I can barely function. Oof! That sucks. Hey, um... Do you want something stronger? I've got a hookup. He's got all sorts of stuff, If you want something to take the edge off, Help you study, just for fun. Painkillers, mdma... No, I... I only have migraines. Okay. Well, if you change your mind... Uh, please don't tell my mom. She's kinda wound up about that stuff. Yeah, yeah, no, of course not. So. Do you like girls or boys? Boys! You're gonna like Lincoln high. I don't know. Suddenly, you're middle-aged. On the tail end of the back nine. I'm sorry. My husband was an avid golfer. Mine was... is... an avid philanderer/liar/cheat/. Good-for-nothing. Wow! Tell me how you really feel. I'm an accountant, Which was the only reason I found out. He was stealing from me. What do you do? I'm a financial adviser. I found a great job downtown at a terrific company. - Awesome. - Yeah. The hardest part about being a single mom. Is juggling the job and what Channing needs me to do, And I start early, But she can't take public transpo. Because those buses are almost always running late. Well, I don't have to be to work until 9:30. I can drop them off at school, if you can pick them up. That would be amazing! Huh! You're a lifesaver. It's no worries. Norah's under a lot of pressure this year, so I want her to stay disciplined. Her having a friend at school will hopefully make. The transition smooth. Well, maybe some of that discipline. Will rub off on Channing. She can be a handful. Well, no kid's perfect. Thanks, mom! Right back at ya. I'm gonna get some more cream. Do you need anything? - I'm good. - Okay. Can you pass me the cream, dear? Excuse me. Ms. Green... Michelle I think we got off on the wrong foot. I suppose we did. It's ms. Green. I'm a widow. Okay. Sure. But you didn't have to call management. We could have worked it out. I didn't call management. It's that helene. She can never let things alone. You know, some people always gotta stick their nose. In other people's business. I'm pretty sure she was just looking out. For the new girls on the block. Yeah, sure, if almost getting me fired. Means looking out for someone these days. Anyway, I'm sorry you were loud. And then I got upset because you don't know. How to move in quietly. You want me to apologize to your girl? No. It's fine. I'll let her know how contrite you are. Come on, girls, we're running late. Hey, Channing. You know, your mom's a real piece of work. No wonder your dad left y'all. She's just... You have no idea what you're talking about, You loser! You provoked her! No. I told her the truth. Get in the car, girls. And you'd better get a handle on her. Otherwise, I'ma call the cops. Hey, can you pass me my file case? What? You did bring it, right? Oh, I'm sorry, mom, I forgot. It's my first day. I should have reminded you earlier, But that guy just creeped me out. Do you have time to run home and get it? I do. All right, girls, you have a good day. Thank you for taking care of her, Channing, okay? No problem, ms. G. Everyone knows me, so she's in good hands. I believe it. All right, girls. Bye. - Wow. - Welcome to your new school. This place is huge. - Those are my friends. - Oh. - Hey! - Oh! This is Norah. - Hey, Norah. Amanda. - Uh, Norah! I'm griffin. Oh... Oh, yes! Oh, god. Hey. - I'm Aiden. - Norah. Norah. What brings you to Lincoln low? They, uh, kicked her out of her last school. Yeah. Booze, drugs, the works. She was a real party girl. - Nice! - What? No, that's not true. What are you saying? Well, then why did you ask me where you could score some m? You're not really a party girl, right? No, not at all. See, you guys? Just trash talk. Uh, what's your first class? English. Oh! Me too. - I'll walk with you. - Oh. Thank you. You're gonna realize with Channing, You have to play pretend. What do you mean? Pretend she's not crazy, Pretend what she says is true, Pretend you're her friend. And you can't get her angry. I made an innocent remark once, And next thing I know, my car was keyed. I'm pretty sure she's the one who did it. What did you say? I don't even remember. Honestly, anything could set her off. I didn't say anything. I mean, she was pretty upset before we left the condo, But it wasn't my fault. You and Aiden kinda had a moment. What? I did not! Well, I mean, he's kinda cute. They went out for, like, a minute. Oh. Okay, I get it. Gimme your number. I'll pass it on to Aiden, if you want. Don't worry, she'll get over it. Can I help you? I got a call to do some work on this condo. I didn't call anyone. Must be Lawrence. Must be. I'm josh. I'm the building contractor. I've done most of the renovations on these units. - Michelle. - Pleasure, nice to meet you. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get in your way. I just have to get something for work. So are you subletting from helene? No, they live on the second floor. Wait, they used to live here? Yeah. You didn't know that? So, what's the damage? The damage? What do you need me to repair? Oh. There's an electrical socket that isn't working. - This one right here? - Yeah. It's probably a short or a loose wire. There's a lot of things around here. That's not working. Yeah, it's a loose wire. Don't you usually turn off the breaker? Nah, it's low voltage. It'll be fine. - So is it just you here? - My daughter and me. Oh, that's nice. So what else do you got for me? There's a broken light switch cover in my daughter's room. I've also noticed you've got some bubbling over your sink. Yeah, I noticed that. It's probably the pipes. They break or they get worn out. Condensation sets in, And then your drywall starts to peel. So, that one... Ooh... That one, I'm gonna have to come back for, But I can change the switch plate today. My daughter Norah, she would actually love that, But I have to get to work. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm keeping you. Oh, no, no, it's just that I don't like. Strangers in my home doing repairs when I'm not here. Of course, I get it. Hopefully, we don't, uh, remain strangers. Hopefully. Uh, so, make that list, I'll get it all fixed. You don't even have to deal with Lawrence. - Really? - Yeah. So gimme a call when you're ready... - Uh-huh. - And we can take it from there. And I wouldn't want a stranger to do the repairs, so... Maybe dinner afterwards? No pressure. I will still do the work. - Maybe. - I'll take a maybe. I will take a maybe. Well, thanks, josh. - Bye. - Bye. On your block! Ready... Set... Well done, Norah! That's just a second short of the school record. Hey. Hey! How's it goin'? Why did you... Why did you tell them I was a party girl earlier? Norah, I was totally joking. They all knew I was joking. Chill out. You're fast, superwoman. Thanks! What's going on, you guys doing something? Uh, no, just taking these derelicts home. Sorry, we got a full load. I'd give you a lift, Norah, But you'd probably have to sit on aiden's lap. What is good, ladies? You tryin' to take a ride in this beautiful suv with us? I mean, come on, I know you want to. I mean, how can you say no to this? - Get back in the car, man! - Hold on! Lemme finish what I'm trying to say. I'm trying to invite them to sit in this car with us. Come on, I know you want to. Come on, buddy, we got places to be. Don't call me buddy. Shut up, Amanda! - Get back in the car! - Get back in the car? - Yeah! - Get back in your face. I'm wanted elsewhere. - Offer still stands. - Okay. All right. See you guys tomorrow. Bye! Who's the text from? No one. My mom. Here's my mom. Come on. What did I do with my pills? Where are they? Norah? You would not believe my day. Your mother got asked on a date. Norah? Norah! Baby. Baby, you all right? What happened? - Pills. I can't find them. - Okay. - Hey! - Hey! Some homemade chicken soup for our sick girl. - Thanks, helene. - Mm-hm. I would invite you in, but norah's sleeping right now. No, it's perfectly fine. We were both worried. Channing said she'll get her homework for her tomorrow. That's sweet of her. Can I ask you something? Mm-hm. Did you used to live here? Oh yeah, you caught me. It's a long story. Had a really bad breakup with my ex. He would stalk us and show up uninvited, and... It's all right. You don't have to get into it. - I understand. - Thanks. I just couldn't afford this bigger place, So we moved downstairs into a one-bedroom. When it became available. Channing's had so much upheaval. I didn't want her to move, lose friends. Mm. But don't worry. Dan, my ex, is long gone. - You're safe. - Okay. It's our situation that's rough. Sure. I get it. And I'm here for you. But I better get back to Norah. - Of course. - Okay? - Give her our best. - I will. - You have a good night. - You too. Good night. Thank you. All right, slow down! I'm not that young anymore. But I missed four days of training. - You should ease into it. - I am! If this is easing in, I'd hate to see what jumping in looks like. Let's walk for a while. So, tell me about this mystery guy. You've been flirting with. What'd you say his name was? - Jeff? - Josh. His name is josh. And I'm not flirting. He's the building contractor. - Lawrence? - No! Please, that guy, he makes my skin crawl. He doesn't live in the building. And he asked me out. So he's hot, right? Stop it! But yes, he's attractive. Ooh! You should give him a call. - Hm. - You know, I've been told. That it's not frowned upon, Especially for a woman in your age circle, To make the first move! That's what you've been told? Look, mom. I know you're lonely, And I know that you have been throwing yourself into work. To keep your mind off of dad. I miss him too. A lot. But he wouldn't want you to be alone. You deserve at least one night out. Since when did I get such a wise daughter? Oh, I've always been like this. But I got it from dad. Come on. One date won't kill you. All right. I'll give it some thought. Plus, like you said, you are not gettin' any younger. - Really? Really? - Come on, I'll race you home! Come on! - Hello? - Hey! Um... I'm not sure if you remember me. Michelle! And your last name is "maybe," right? Yeah. Although that's not my last name. It's green, actually. What can I do for you? Do you have that list of what needs fixing? Yeah, and... yes to the maybe. You know, dinner. Oh! Wow. Really? I'm... that's terrific, um I didn't think you were interested. I was actually kicking myself for asking, but... Yes, okay! Let me pick a spot and I'll text you details. How's, uh, Friday? Sure. Sounds good. Bye. Hey, Channing. How are you? Um, I'm all right. How are you, ms. G? I'm never better. Oh. Did you... Yeah. What are you guys talking about? Nothing. Hey, Amanda. Hey! Oh. The bell rang, we should hurry. What was that with your mom? What do you mean? Was it about me? No. Norah, I need you to tell me. I do not like it when people joke about me. Most people don't. Look, if you must know, Some guy asked my mom out, I told her she should do it, She was talking to him, that's it. Because I-I really am sorry about telling them. You were a party girl. I just wanted them to think you were cool, Which you totally are. I'm late. I gotta get to class. Best friends shouldn't keep secrets. But I'm not keeping any secrets! So bffs, huh? You heard that? Just the juicy little tidbit at the end. Yeah. Channing's a real piece of work, isn't she? Yeah. What is her deal? She was normal until her parents got divorced. Then she started acting all weird and clingy and... Overall, just mean. That's too bad. I hope she gets over that. I don't think she will. She's a stage 5 clinger, that's for sure. Dinner was great. I had fun. Well, it doesn't have to end. Oh, I-I... No, no, no, no, no, I didn't mean it that way. I meant, would you like to go grab a coffee with me? Yeah. Sure. I'd love that. Enough of this. Next Saturday, I'm having some friends over, Including Aiden. Yeah? Is Channing gonna be there? No. And do not invite her. But I can't... - What if she finds out? - Why? Is it because she's your best friend. And you shouldn't keep secrets? You know what? Who's that? One second. Hey, my mom's gone shopping. You wanna hang out? We're studying. Do you wanna hang out tomorrow instead, or... My old man was a jack of all trades, Do anything for a dollar type of guy. He'd even take a job and then try to figure it out. But not me, I'm formally trained. Mm. My husband, he was pretty handy too. Norah's dad. When he died, I thought my world was over, - You know? - Of course. Well, it was really hard picking up the pieces. I'm sorry. This is a little heavy for first-date conversation. Oh no. I haven't done this since my 20s. I don't even know if I'm doing it right, josh. You're doing just fine. It's not like we haven't been around the block, and... It's all about what we learn from it. I guess so. And what we've learned is, Not too much tmi on the first date. - It was, wasn't it? - No. Although, I think your sentence was a bit redundant. Like, "too much" is already in "tmi." So, basically, you're just left with information. - Whoa. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'm nervous. Whoo! Look, I'm... I'm just a simple guy, All right? Measure twice, cut once. And how am I measuring up? Well, I've only measured once, So give me another date, I'll measure a second time, And I'll let you know. Nice. - That was a good one. - Thank you. I do have my moments of smoothness. They're rare, but once in a while, I don't get tongue-tied when speaking to a beautiful woman. Um... I have to ask. The other week when you came by, You insinuated something about helene. Did I? It was probably nothing, just talk. Mm, but, you know, It wouldn't be the first time helene's made fast friends. Before throwing them under the bus, so. I'd avoid her. - Milady? - Thank you. Um... Hey, Norah. You know what? You should try out for the soccer team. Channing's goalie and I'm on defense. And if you make the team, We'd have more time together. The three of us! Yeah? Isn't the team already full? No. I mean, the ones we have are mostly. Benchwarmer material anyway. She should try out, right, Channing? Sure. But if she thinks she can get anything past me, She's in for a surprise. - Thanks. - No problem. I'd forgotten what it was like. Not to hang out with teenagers all the time. Well, they can't have all the fun, can they? - Absolutely not. - No. But you still haven't answered my question. Is there a second date? Sure. You measure up. So far. Goodnight. Oh, I-I... I am sorry, is that too forward? No. It was nice. It was nice. Where have you been, young lady? None of your business, mother! That is an unacceptable response. And I wanna know all the details. It's acceptable, And it's not for publication just yet. You're so nosy! So, speaking of details, did you remember. To get the laundry from downstairs? Oh, shoot, no, I'm sorry, I forgot. I was studying. It's okay. - I got it. - Mm-kay. - Channing, don't, please! - I'm gonna do it! You're gonna just do it again, you will! - I'll stop! - Are you gonna do it again? Please just put that down. I promise, please! - Just put it down, Channing! - I love him, And he loves me, we wanna be together! Can't you see what is wrong with him? Can't you see what he's doing? - He is just using you. - He's not using me! Yes he is. You have no idea what's going on between us, mom! - For the last time, please! - I'm gonna do it! Helene? Helene, it's Michelle. Is everything all right? We're fine. It's nothing. You should... you should go. Are you sure? I was just doing my laundry and I heard noises. No. If you need help, - You could give me a sign. - No! We're fine. Okay? Just please mind your own business. Hey, Channing! - How are you? - Fine. Is everything all right? I heard arguing last night. Yeah, I know you did. My mom and I were having it out. It happens sometimes. We can't all have perfect lives like yours. Okay. Can you please tell her to mind her own business? One mom is bad enough. She was just worried. She doesn't need to be. What in the... What happened? Oh... What? What does it say? "Keep your nose out of other people's business!" Whose business? Oof. What happened? Someone keyed my car. Wow. Did you guys see this side? We saw it. Looks like calligraphy, or the... - You're so annoying. - The rorschach, What do you see when... Man, this is bad. This is really bad. You know what? It's probably those same idiots. That busted up the mail room a few months back. We certainly have our share of hoodlums. In this neighborhood. Really? I wish the realtor would have told me that. It's gotten so bad, every night, I've got to put a chain and padlock. On the east door just to get some extra security. Sorry 'bout your car. But hey... Least it still runs, right? He is so annoying. Do you think he did it? I don't know. He's a creep. He just watches everyone. Come on, girls, let's go. Well, I'm pretty sure, And Channing can back me up on this, That it was that site maintenance guy. He's had it in for us since we got there. Maybe he likes your mom. Uh... No! Well, some guys'll do anything for attention. Or maybe it was you, Norah. Why would I key my own car? Well... You have our attention, don't you? If anything, it would make more sense. That you did it. What? Are you crazy? I'm your best friend, why would I do that? I'm not... Channing, what is your problem? Hey, hey! Whoever did it, at least it was only the paint. Right? Well, I'm glad you're safe. We have to get ready! - It's norah's big day. - Right! - Bye. - Bye. Bye, guys. Dude. It was me. I'm just kidding, geez! Nice job, nice job! Nice, Channing, there we go. All right, Norah, let's see what you got. Nice! Come on, Channing, hustle, let's go! Oh yeah! Nice, Norah! Yeah, there we go! Got some competition there, Channing! That's what I like to see! Come on, channy, you got it, let's stay focused, It's just you and her. You got it, Channing. There we go! Nice work, Norah! Wow. Channing, gotta watch the sides. - Norah. - Yeah. If you can hustle like that, I'll make you starting forward. - Really? - Yeah. I'd love that. - See you on the field tomorrow. - Okay. Coach says she's gonna make her starting forward. What do you mean, "so what"? She humiliated me out there. I want you to fix it. Gotta go. Hey, I hear you're joining the team. Yeah. It'll look good on the track scholarship applications. - You okay with that, captain? - Of course. You got skills. The team is lucky to have you. So... Now that we're both besties and teammates, No more lies. Okay? What? Do you wanna hang out on Saturday afternoon? Saturday? Yeah, you're not doing anything, right? I-I am, I am. I'm, um, spending it with my mom. She, uh... She's been spending a lot of time. With that guy lately, so... She promised me a shopping day. Don't wanna let her down. Okay. I understand. How 'bout Sunday? Sure. We'll see. Starting forward? Honey, I'm so proud of you, that's amazing! Proud enough to let me go to a party? - What party? - It's amanda's. It's in the afternoon, you met her. I don't know. It's not really even a party, More like a small gathering. All right. You earned it. Listen, I need to talk to you about something. It's josh. You wanna get that? No. It can wait. This sounds important. It's really not. Go ahead. Hey. Hey! What are you doing? Spending some quality time with my daughter. We just had a very nice dinner. Can't wait to meet her. Well, we'll see if you earn the right. To bask in her glory. Challenge accepted. And I promise, I will be on my best behavior. What are you doing Saturday afternoon? You wanna go see a show, walk around downtown? Saturday afternoon? I can do Saturday. I'm gonna call you when I get home, okay? Okay. Talk to you then. Bye. So, what are we gonna wear? So... What do you think? I thought it was a small gathering. It is. Then what's the name of the boy you're trying to impress? No one. Okay, his name is Aiden. Mm-hm! Well, I'm sure aiden's gonna fall in love with you. In that top. And I'm sure josh will fall for you in that, If he hasn't already. Well, josh is gonna pick me up, so you can take the car. Are you gonna bring Channing? Uh, no, channing's not coming because she has homework. Okay. Is everything all right with you two? She hasn't been over in a while. Yeah, oh no, everything's fine. She just has a lot of homework to do. Okay. Let's go. Whoa. All right, you win, man. What are you talking about? Oh, these morons bet whether or not. You'd bring Channing. Why? She's nuts... I mean, Aiden would know. - You dated her. - It wasn't dating. We went out twice, and then, she wouldn't let go. She stalked for... how long was it, a couple months? Four, but who's counting? I didn't know it was that bad. Old news. Do you wanna get a drink? Oh! Since you're offering, beer me, I need a refill. I was offering to Norah. Uh, I'm in training. - Oh, come on! - No, I really shouldn't. - Hey, hey! Chug it, chug it... - No, I shouldn't... - Chug! - Hey! She doesn't want one. Come on, let's go get a soda or something. Yeah. Wow! Channing? Yeah. Don't worry about it, she's not that bad. She was just... Clingy and always checking my location. Dude, we call that stalking. She wasn't stalking me in the traditional sense. Just more in the paranoid/ insecure girlfriend sense. Oh yeah, 'cause that's a big difference. Personally, I think she was just acting that way. Because of her parents' divorce. I mean, she kinda lost her dad, And then I think she was afraid of losing her boyfriend as well. I mean, technically, for a brief moment in time... You were her boyfriend. Believe it or not, she mellowed. You should know, you're her "bestie." Yeah. Everyone constantly reminds me, In case I forget. Oh, thanks. And I really am training. Well, your body's a temple. Especially in that outfit. I have to ask you a question. Okay. - Come on. - Okay. Hey, guys. Hi. Okay. So, I have a question for you. - It's really important. - Is it? Did you have a boyfriend at your other school? Yeah. But I... It was casual. I'm trying to focus. I got this plan I'm trying to stick to. I want to get an athletic scholarship. And then go to an ivy league school. I know. So, you're single? Is that what you got out of all that? No, I got the other stuff. Single, smart, sporty, and wants a scholarship. The four ss I look for in a woman. So what do you look for in a man? Honesty. Tick. - Loyalty. - Tick. Funny -super tick! Really, really tall. Like basketball tall. So close. Does liking you not count? It counts. Well... I like you. A lot. I like you too. What was that? Yo! Damn it. Oh, hey Norah, I didn't know you were coming. - Hey. - Hey! - I love your swimsuit. - Thanks! Let's go to the pool. So how long you guys been here for? Yeah. Whoever did this, this is totally not cool. Hey, Michelle! Hey! How ya doing? I'm okay. I just wanted to apologize for the other night. - Oh, there's no need. - No, there is. You were just trying to help and I wanted to explain. There's... A lot of gossip about me. My ex-husband, dan... He showed up drunk. He's lost custody because he owes so much in child support. We got into a fight... And I threatened to call the police. Channing loves him so... I let him leave. Okay. I'm in the middle of filing a restraining order. I know everyone in the condo. Thinks I'm a hot mess but... It's been difficult. Don't worry, helene. People are always ready to believe. The worst about someone, But I wasn't gonna judge until I talked to you. I'm so glad to hear you say that. You know how hard it is to make friends at our age. Although, I guess, not for you. Channing told me you're dating a guy. Oh. I guess I am. You guess? Yeah, well, when my husband Eric died, I didn't think that I'd ever be able. To care about anyone again but... Tell me about him. His name is josh. And he's a construction guy. Wait, where did you meet him? - Here. - Oh my god, josh? Josh, our building contractor? - Yeah. - Oh, he's great! - Yeah. - He's fixed I can't tell you how many things he's repaired for me. - Mm-hm. - And he's cute too. I know. And that's a problem, I can't stop thinking about him. Well, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry. It's no worries. Well, you're lucky. When we broke up, dan chased away. Every man that has ever shown interest in me. Hm. Where's Norah? Oh, out with friends. Oh, that party. I've been so preoccupied I forgot. I guess Channing went with Norah in your car? Norah said that Channing wasn't going to the party. So, no, Norah didn't take her. Oh, well, I guess my daughter changed her mind, Didn't tell me, and took an uber. Terrific. To teenagers? Yeah. I'm just down the street, want me to walk you home? Oh, no, I'm fine, I'm just a few blocks that way. - I'm good. - Are you sure? It's not a problem. Well, yeah, 'cause then you'll want to get all kissy. And romantic and stuff. Plus, I can take care of myself. I gathered that. I just... I wanted to make sure you're okay after the... Beer bottle death from above thing. You looked a little freaked out. Oh, no, I'm fine. I'll just put my music in, It always calms me down. Will you text me when you get home? You can do better than that. You're right. I can. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Mom? Mom, help me, please. Help. - Thank you, josh. - Helping a damsel in distress. Is always my go-to play. Oh, is that somehow anti-feminist these days? Social mores aside, it's what was needed. Sorry we had to meet like this. Oh, no worries, no worries. While I was going to share this with your mom. As dessert after a lovely dinner, It just so happens. That the best thing for a fractured foot. Is... Homemade cake. And... A friend to go with. Aww. You didn't have to do that. I wanted to. Uh, where should I put him? - Over there, yeah. - I'll just put him... Over here for now. You're amazing, you know that? I don't know what I did to deserve you. Ohh. Thank you. I'm gonna put Norah into bed, okay? - Okay. - Just give me a few minutes. All right. All right. Sit back. Okay. All right, easy. Easy. - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. - Okay. It could have been a lot worse. Fractured ankle, bruised ribs, Minor concussion. For an accident like this, You got off pretty lucky. I don't think it was an accident, mom. What do you mean? Well, something weird happened at the party. Somebody tried to drop a beer bottle on my head. From the second story window. - What? - It missed me. But I think it might have been Channing. Channing? She's one of your best friends. No, she's not. Everybody keeps saying that but she's not. I barely know her. Okay, okay. And then after the whole beer bottle thing, I get hit by a car? Mom, that's too weird. All right. I'm gonna talk to helene as soon as josh leaves. Now, you did see Channing drop the bottle. Out the window, right? No. But you saw her drive the car? I didn't see the driver either. Do you have any solid proof it was Channing? I just have a hunch. I can't go to helene or the cops on a hunch. I know. Which is why I didn't know if I should tell you or not, But mom, I... Listen. There's nothing we can do about it now. Get some rest, okay? Your body is in shock. It's okay. All right. Okay. Whoa. What happened? I got hit by a car. Oh my god. Are you all right? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Doctor said I can take this thing off pretty soon. That's why you didn't text me when you got home. I... Thought you were ghosting me. If I was ghosting you, you would know it. Actually, I wouldn't. That's... Literally what ghosting means. I really wish you'd just let me walk you home. Did you see the driver? No. I had my earbuds in, I didn't even hear it coming. It just hit me from behind outta nowhere. I'm sorry. Can I sign your cast? It's not that kind of a cast. Oh. Well, with the sobriety and life goals, I kind of pegged you for being a little old school. Well, in one sense I am. What sense is that? You can open my locker. Okay. And take out my history book. Right. And close my locker. Put the lock back on it and lock it. And you can walk me to class. Yes, very old school. Here we go. Come on, yup. Pass it, pass it. There we are. Nice work, Channing! All right, let's, uh, let's take five. You enjoying the show? What? Yeah, it sucks being on the sidelines, huh? Don't worry, you'll be back on the field soon enough. Look, um, I'm sure you have pain meds. But... I can get you something stronger. If what they gave you isn't enough. All right, let's go round two, girls. Gotta run. No pun intended. Yeah, be careful. Never know when a car or something might hit you. When you're not looking. Let's go, let's go, let's go. No way. Nice. Channing, what is this? What are my pills doing in your bag? Keep going. Oh. I totally forgot about those. Yeah, sure you did. Why'd you steal them from me? How did you steal them from me? Relax. I found them on the floor of the locker room. I was gonna tell you, I just forgot. They must have fallen out of your locker or something. Yeah, yeah, that's crap and you know it. I don't know what you're up to. Or if you're just jealous, But you need to stay away from me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, all right, knock it off. Channing, get back on the field. Channing, back on the field. Norah, I think until you're feeling better, You shouldn't come back to practice. Norah green, please report to the front office. Norah green to the front office. Norah green. We had an anonymous tip. And we found these in your locker. You know we have a zero tolerance policy on drugs. I don't do drugs. I don't even drink or smoke. Those aren't mine. Norah, if I had a, I don't know, A dollar for every student at this school. Who told me, "those drugs aren't mine," I'd probably have enough to take the entire faculty. On a company retreat to Barbados. All right, maybe not Barbados, But definitely Vegas. The thing I don't understand. Is coach Bradley says you're a shoo-in. For an athletic scholarship. You're one of the good kids. But I'm telling you the truth. Then how did they get in your locker? Does anybody know your combination except you? No. Somebody pried open my vent and stuffed them in there. Let me guess, to frame you? Probably, yeah! Okay. We'll look into it. But you need to understand something, young lady. This is a serious offense. Kids die from this crap all the time. I'm gonna have to suspend you. And pending an investigation, I might have to expel you. Did you call her mother to come pick her up? It's Channing! I know it is. Why do you think it's Channing? The day we met, The first thing she tells me. Is how she can get me in touch with a guy. Who supplies her with mdma and painkillers. Why didn't you tell me this? Because I didn't want to get her in trouble. She's the one that took my migraine medicine, mom. I found 'em in her bag. I'm pretty sure she's the one that tried to run me over. You have to believe me. I believe you. But why would she do all that? She's mental. You know that guy I like? Aiden? Channing went out with him. He said she stalked him. All right. I'll have a word with Channing and her mother. As soon as we get home. Michelle? What do you need? We need to talk about your daughter. Okay, come on in. Channing, where are you? What is this about? Norah's been suspended from school. Oh, see, mom? I told you she was trouble since day one. You're the one who planted drugs in my locker! Stop trying to pin your dirt on me. Okay, ms. G, I'm sorry, I should have told you about this sooner. But she threatened me if I did. Norah has been dealing to the whole school. Ask anyone. I'm sure if we ask around they'll probably say it was you. - I've met girls like you. - Wait a second! Don't accuse my daughter without any proof. She hit Norah with her car! I did not! Mom, I told you... That's impossible, Michelle. She can't drive. She doesn't even have her license. Her father said he was gonna give her lessons. But the deadbeat just says he doesn't have the time. And I only have the one car. I know where I was that afternoon, Michelle. With you! Norah, does the car that hit you look like my car? I don't know, it all happened so quickly. It looked like it was a Honda. I drive a Subaru. You're just gonna have to accept. That this was an accident. Channing had no part in it. Even if it was an accident, It doesn't excuse her trying to ruin my daughter's reputation. I don't have to do anything to do that. Norah does a good enough job on her own. As a drug dealer. - You know what? - Uh-uh. What? You wanna hit me? Yeah, I'd be careful. For an athlete, you're pretty accident-prone. You might miss, fall over, fracture the other foot. Channing, shut your mouth and grow up. Don't talk to my daughter like that. You still haven't given an ounce of proof. That she's done anything wrong, Just accusations. Hey, all right, everybody's just gotta. Break this up and keep the noise down. Lawrence, this doesn't concern you. Why don't you take your own advice. And stop buttin' in to other people's affairs? No, it does concern me. You're disturbing the other residents. All right, I've already punched 9-1-1 into the phone. All I gotta do is press "dial". And then the cops will be on their way. And you'll be on your way outta this condo permanently. And then maybe we can all get a good night's sleep. For a change. Come on, Norah. Stay away from Channing. Believe me, mom, that won't be a problem. How does it feel? Good. Better. It's great to not have to be in that boot anymore. Mm-hm. To modern medicine. Mm. When you were a kid, I used to give you milkshakes. When you were upset. A little ice cream went a long way. We should move. It's not that easy. All of our savings are tied up in that condo. Well, I'd give you some of my drug money. If only I had some. You sure? You sure you don't have any? Yes, mom. All right. Wanna go see a movie? Yeah, that'd be great. What do you wanna see? What is it? Call 9-1-1. I'd like to report a break-in. 99 parkland, apartment 408. Lawrence! Oh, I'm sorry, sorry, Lawrence, I'm sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Are you okay? Mom. Mom! What, honey? Mom. Did you do this? What? The only person who doesn't want us living here is you. Well, I'm not the only one apparently. You have keys, you have opportunity, And you have motive. Oh, you better watch your tongue. Or this is gonna cost you more than your damage deposit. Then what are you doing here? I got a noise complaint from your next-door neighbor. Maybe you did this. - What? - Uh-huh. Does this look like something we'd do? No, no, no, you and helene have got a lot of problems. With each other. Gettin' rid of her would solve it. - Wouldn't it? - That is ludicrous. Yeah. Tell it to the cops. We already called them. On yourselves? Okay! Okay. Oh. Honey. I know, I know. I know. I know. - Helene! - Yeah? You trashed our place. You and Channing. I haven't stepped foot in your condo. Unless you invited me. You don't have to worry about that happening again. When were we supposed to have done this, Michelle? We've been out all morning. It was plenty enough time for you to get in and out. Wait. You still have keys to our place? No. You're off your rocker, lady. We just got back from channing's soccer match. It was an exhibition game. You wouldn't know that because you're dealing. With your juvenile delinquent drug dealing daughter. Channing told me how you keyed your own car. I didn't key my own car! That was Channing! Or you. Channing may be a lot of things. But a vandal isn't one of them. You know, people here have some ideas about us. But none of us have any clue who you are. You have all the answers, don't you? No, just the truth. Something you can't seem to deal with. When it comes to Norah. You stay away from us. Or so help me, I'll end this. Are you threatening me? Consider it a warning. Your mom's got some brass, huh? You all heard her. You recorded this? Send that to me. Channing, let's go. Wait, helene, don't start things... Lawrence! I need my locks changed. We change the locks for owners. Before they move in. The door wasn't tampered with. So whoever trashed our condo. Is someone who has keys! Okay, look, if you want me to come and check on you. From time to time to make sure you're safe, I can do that. Forget it. I'll handle it myself. Come on. All done. I installed a high security deadbolt. So it's gonna take some doing to break it. - Thank you. - No problem. No problem. The police said it's a personal matter. And just logged it as a break-in. And told us to beef up security. I can install an alarm and camera system if you like. I mean, you can even check in remotely. On what's happening. These cameras are really small, You can hide them almost anywhere. Or in anything. That'd be great. Other than steering clear of helene, I'm not sure what else we can do. - You want some coffee? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. - Hey, whatever you need. I'm on your side. Need some help with the trophy? Yes, please. You know, I've met helene's ex. I've had drinks with him a couple times. And I wouldn't put anything past her. After what she did to him. You hold that. What'd she do? Well, from what I hear... You gotta hold that down... She made his life a... A living nightmare. Pinned him on some trumped up domestic charges. Here, I'll hold that. Got him fired from his job, Cut him off from his child. I mean, no wonder channing's as troubled as she is. - Hm. - Girls need. A strong father figure. Oh, hold that, hold that. Oh, gotta go. Duty calls. They really have you working strange hours, don't they? Well, trouble doesn't clock in or out. - I'm sorry, that was bad. - It was bad. Sorry. I'm sorry. - All right, bye. - Goodbye. - Hold that for five minutes. - Got it. All right? Goodnight. So what you think of him? I mean, he's cool, I guess. I might keep him. Oo! Okay! Oh my god. Oh my god, Channing! Oh my god! Baby! Oh my god! Baby, what happened? What happened, sweetheart? They just came outta nowhere. Who came outta nowhere? Norah. - Ms. G. - What? What did I do that was so wrong, mom? Oh, sweetie, nothing, sweetheart. Why do they keep hurting us and lying to us? I don't know. I was just trying to be her friend, mom. I know, I know. Don't move, I have the first aid kit in the car, okay? Just stay right here. Where is the faculty? Does anyone work at this school? Hello? Just stay right there, sweetheart. Ow! - Ladies, knock it off! - What did you do that for? - Like you don't know! - What is wrong with you? Enough! Enough with the innocent routine. You have crossed the line, I am pressing charges. I'm pressing charges! Okay, she says you and your daughter roughed up her kid. What? No way. We were out shopping. They wrecked our place. Any proof of that? Look, she came at me. Where's her kid anyway? At least show us what we were supposed to have done. I don't know. Helene can't locate her. That's convenient. She claims her daughter's probably scared. And hiding from you. The lies just keep getting better and better. Look, it's obvious you have issues with each other. I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Me? I've said it to helene as well. Go back to your condos and stay away from one another. We've had numerous nuisance calls to 9-1-1. From this building. They hit my daughter with a car. And destroyed our place. Those are not nuisance calls. There's still no evidence she did any of that. Take my warning seriously. If you call 9-1-1 again needlessly, I'll charge you with a class I misdemeanor. Understood? Mom. Understood. Okay. What is it? We have to appear before the condo board. If we want to keep this place. Can they do that? It's just another thing we have to discuss. With the lawyers. Ms. Green? Can I help you? Was I speaking too loudly to my daughter? Tonight's the night they fumigate. Don't forget. You have to be outta here by midnight. I know, we're going to a hotel. Also, you didn't file a work request. So I filed it for you. A work request? For what? The lock. I'm gonna grab one and change it. Just like you wanted. Josh just changed it. Josh, the building contractor? Yeah. No, he's on vacation. No, he's not. He just changed the locks, Lawrence. No. He left for Israel about a month before you got here. But you can't be changing this lock. Without submitting a work request. We need a copy of the keys for the office. It's in your contract. Day after tomorrow. My darn feet hurt so much. Are they gonna spray the fridge too? I don't know. Probably. - You packed? - Yup. We should throw all this out. Oh no, we are not gonna throw away this cake. We are gonna eat it right now. No, I don't think so. Smell it. - Smell it. - Why not? Okay, grab two forks. I wish dad was here. He would know what to do. Well, for starters, he'd punch lawrence's lights out. Yeah, but you maced him. A maced face is as good as a punched one. Any day of the week in my book. Your mom's still got it. What's the matter? Something Lawrence said about josh. What'd he say? It's probably nothing. It's weird though. I don't know. We should go. I'll tell you in the car. Whoa. - Norah? - I feel dizzy, like... Norah? Norah? You okay? Okay. Okay, all right. What's the matter with them, dad? She's waking up. Hey there, sunshine. That's the drugs, honey. They make your tongue feel a little swollen. But... That'll wear off in a bit. That's a tough girl you've got there. Thought the hit-and-run would have killed her. Which she deserved after humiliating my daughter. On the soccer field. Man. Nobody believes in the girl code anymore. Wait, dad. Did you try to run her down? Of course I did, sweetheart. I did it for you. I never asked you to hurt her like that. Help! Help! Help us! Don't waste your breath. The building is empty. They're gonna start fumigating... In about an hour, So everybody's gone. Channing, get the teddy cam, We can't leave that behind. Right, where is it? Right over there. On the counter in the kitchen. What do you want from me? What do I want from you? What do I want from you? Nothing, really. I mean, to be honest, You and your daughter just happened to move. In the wrong condo at the wrong time. My beef is with my darling, beautiful wife, helene. Why? Because she pushed me out of the family. She forbids me to talk to my own daughter. Isn't that right, baby? - Well, that's gonna change. - And on top of that, Helene got me fired from my job. I have lost everything! Thanks to her. You're probably thinking, "what does this have to do with us?" Well, to answer your question, This is how the two of you fit into this. I'm going to bash both your brains in. And... oh wait, it gets better... And. I'm going to use this hammer to do it. Which has helene's fingerprints all over it. After all your public disagreements with helene, The cops are certainly going to arrest her. For your murders. Helene will go to san Quentin. And I will take custody over Channing. And the both of us will move back into this condo. Which we should have never left in the first place. W-w-wait. Hold on. You're gonna kill them? Yeah. So? You never said anything about killing anybody. You said we would make them so uncomfortable living here. That they would want to move out. - Well, let me explain. - No, then you and mom. Would get back together and the three of us. Would move back into this condo, just like it was before. Michelle and Norah aren't moving out. Can't you see that? We tried. It didn't work. - I don't like this. - No, no, no, baby, baby, baby. The only way for you and I to move back up here. In this condo is to get rid of them. You and I can be together. But we have to send mommy away. Does your mother want us to be together? No, she doesn't. She hates me. You and me can live up here in this condo. You can have your room back. With the view that you like. We can be back on top. Now... You should go to your bedroom and plug your ears. Because you don't want to hear this. - No, no, no! - Channing, what are you Channing, just... It's okay. Stop! Channing, stop it. Get off of me. Channing, let me go! Channing, let me go! What are you doing? Channing! Channing. Oh my god. Oh my god. Are you okay, baby? Channing. Open... Open your eyes, baby. Are you okay? Holy... Oh my god, baby. Why did you do this? Wake up. Help! Help! Help me, please! Shh. All set? Yeah. I just got a call from the da. Dan... I guess you know him as josh, Confessed to everything. He's gonna plead guilty on all counts. I'm gonna miss you ladies. We're gonna miss you too. Thanks for helping me load the truck. No problem. Channing, let's go. Hey. I just wanna say I'm sorry. My mom found me a really good therapist. So I'm gonna get some help. I promise. Channing. You saved our lives. We're forever grateful. Come here. See you on the soccer field? I'm still gonna kick your butt. - Bye. - Bye. Mom, can I ask you something? Sure. Do you think we should move out? No. We earned the right to stay here. Besides. I really love that view. Don't you?
