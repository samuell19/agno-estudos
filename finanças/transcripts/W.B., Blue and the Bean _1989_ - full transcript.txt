(upbeat music) - Hi, Mrs. Bromberg. You're looking good. - [Mrs. Bromberg] Oh thank you, Mr. Haronian. Have a good day. - I hope the fat bitch croaks. Hi, kids. - [Boy] Hi Mr. Haronian. (dog barking) (dog growling) - I hope the mutt bites their asses off. (dramatic music) - Oh Aram, you know I really love you. - Yeah right, don't complicate it, huh baby? We're running late. Come on, move your ass. - [Woman] I love you, tiger. - Come on, come on. Go hide, you dumb bimbo. - Goodbye, Aram honey. I'll see you tonight. (car horn honking) - [Aram] Hey Steve, get up you old scrump. - Come on back Mr. Haronian. Come on back. Move it this way a little. Come on back. Get on back. Turn around, sir. Hard to the right, sir. Yeah, there, got a little more, sir. That's good, sir. That, that, that, that's fine. Good, good, good morning, Mr. Haronian. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Gee Mr. Haronian, I've been here since six. Could at least I get 50 cents? - Look Steve, a deal's a deal. You know that, now hit the road. And don't be late for tomorrow. - [Charlie] Good morning, boss. - Yeah, not yet it ain't. Damn traffic. Any schmucks last night? - Two drunk drivers. Wives bailed them out. - How safe? - Oh one's a dentist, big house in Encino. The other owns a condo, a Mercedes, and a boat in the marina. - That's it? Just plain drunk? No hit and run? No murder? - I'm afraid not, Mr. Haronian. Nothing like that. - Shit. (groans) Haven't had a good one in over a month. You know I spoke to my cousin last night in Miami. Jesus, some action he gets down there. You know them Colombians come to him with millions in cash. That way he never has to worry about if they got money. They give it to him to hold. That way when they do get popped, bingo. He's got 'em back on the street in two, three hours. Meantime he's collecting interest on the millions he's holding in the bank. Some fucking business, I'm telling you. - I'm glad to hear your cousin's doing so good. - I hope he drops dead, the cheap fuck. (phone ringing) - Haronian Bail. Oh just a minute, Pete. I'll put Mr. Haronian on. This could be a big one, boss. - Yeah Pete, what do you got? Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. All righty. You tell the little lady not to worry about a thing. I'm on my way down there. Yeah. Oh yeah, and Pete, there's a definite bonus in this for you. All right. - Well Charlie, it looks like Christmas in July. We got ourselves a heiress. - Pick 'em up King. Come on, you can do better than that. Hit him up. Yeah that's right. Yeah, now you got him. Keep those hands up. Keep 'em up. - [Blue] That your man? - [Man] Yeah, what's it to you? - Man, somebody's gonna rip his head off. He don't know how to cover. - Hey why don't you go about your business, and let me take care of mine, huh? - Keeping fighters like that out of trouble, that is my business. You mind if I show your boy something? - Hey man, you know you look familiar. I don't know you, do I? - You shitting me? You don't know who I am? Hey brothers, hold it, hold it just a minute. - Man, shit. - Wait a minute there. Who the fuck are you? - Who am I? You ever heard of Muhammad Ali? - Yeah, so what. - You ever heard of Michael Tyson? - And what are these guys to you? - How long have you been training? - 32 years, now get your ass out of the ring. - The old man's gone senile. He doesn't know who I am. I mean I taught the right cross to Michael Tyson. I taught the rope-a-dope to Ali. Wait a minute, just let me show you something. Do me a favor, stand over here. Stand right there, okay. Now King, show me your rope-a-dope. It is King Clive isn't it? - [King] Yeah. - Oh good, okay, show me your rope-a-dope. Come on let's go. Now you see, now that's pathetic. You could get arrested for manslaughter. Drop your arms. Come on, all the way down, come on. Put 'em down, just relax. All right, there you go. No, that's good, that's good. Now you see, we're gonna start this whole thing over from scratch. (fist thuds) - Hey! You're hurting my fighter. (fist thuds) - All right, back off brothers. The King and I got a date with a judge in the morning. Come on, move. - [Child] Two, three, four. (upbeat music) - Hello. - Yeah Garcia, how's the baby? - Oh just fine, Mr. Haronian. You got something for me? - Yeah, well actually I'm talking about some charity work I'm gonna give you Garcia, but I happen to know you need the money. There's this senile old Indian. He ain't got a phone or anything. And I'm nervous that he's gonna forget about his court date, which is tomorrow. So I'll throw you 50 bucks, you drive out there and you remind him, all right? (baby cooing) - 50 bucks ain't much. Where's he live? - At a junkyard (mumbles). - Mr. Haronian, that's 100 miles. Could you pay for my mileage? - Garcia, I'm trying to be a nice guy and give you some charity work, but maybe I'm talking to the wrong guy. Right, I'll call somebody else. - [Bean] No don't, I'll go. I'll come right over and get the papers. Mr. Haronian, what did the old man do? - Manslaughter. - Manslaughter? (birds chirping) (gentle music) (phone ringing) - Oh shit. - Aw, too bad. Nice try though. - This better be important. Mr. Who Hallihan? - Haronian? It's for me, honey. Haronian, this better be important. (laughing) - Yeah, yeah. I got a big one last night. A million dollar bail. Her name is Annette Ridgeway. Now you know her? - Ridgeway, like in newspapers, timber and oil? - Yeah, yeah, that's right. She got picked up last night with some guy. He got caught with 40 pounds of cocaine in the trunk of his Ferrari. She's out on a million dollar bail. - Well that's how you get rich. Isn't it, Aram? What do you want from me? - Check her out, she's due in court on the 9th. I just wanna make sure she shows, all right? - And if she don't show, you're out the mil, right? - Hey, come on. Don't even say things like that. It ain't funny. - [White Bread] Well what's in it for me? - A day's work, I'll give you 500. - Oh Aram, these people are very important. It's gonna be very difficult getting information on them. Make it a 1,000. - 750. - Nine. - Eight. - 850. - Jesus, you're taking the fucking food off my table. What am I gonna say, all right, it's a deal. - I'll call you as soon as I got any information. - All right, don't wait too long, all right? - I'm out the door, bye Aram. - Annette Ridgeway? - Yeah, yeah, you know her? - I used to, yeah. Then she started hanging around with the wrong crowd. Her parents disowned her. - Are you sure? - Mm-hmm. Her um, her father's attorney is my father's attorney. - (chuckles) Well um, you know I've gotta go. Why don't you finish up the hour with the ball machine. And I'll call you later. We'll go out for some sushi and some sake. Thanks, bye, whoo. - Sushi, ball machine, yeah 200 an hour for a ball machine. (dramatic music) - Hello, anybody home? Hello, White Cow Thompson, hello, (gun bangs) Hands up Cow! I'm from the bail bondsman. (gun bangs) Gee, 50 bucks, I don't need this shit. Okay man, okay, I'm leaving! (car starter whirring) Shit! No piss ass Indian is gonna keep me from getting my money. (dramatic music) (guns banging) (explosion booms) (coughing) (gun banging) - Okay, Donald. You can stand up now. - I'm hit. - Not yet. Rubber bullets meant for riots, but I think the next one could be real. (White Bread whistles) - Miss Ridgeway, hi my-- - Hi, you must be, hey! Hey, get your hands off me. What's going on? - Hit the road, fuck face. - [Nettie] Do you know who I am? - No problem, have a nice day. (dramatic music) - Help me! What do you want with me? I can't believe this. - Fuck face huh? (tires squealing) (dramatic music) Blue, WB, run a check on license plate number 2FAN321. A couple of clowns grabbed my client and they headed toward Pasadena. Get ahold of Bean and have him to stand by. I might need both of you. (tires squealing) I can't believe that guy called me a fuck face. - Your boyfriend ain't too smart. Is he, missy? - He's a policeman. I just thought I'd let you know. - He's a two bit bounty hunter by the name of Roger Donaldson. - [Nettie] And who are you? - Your daddy sent us to make sure you get home. (car engine revving) (dramatic music) (gun banging) (gun banging) (Nettie screams) (speaking in foreign language) (phone rings) - Hello. Yeah, Haronian. Oh yeah, everything is just fine. Everything is okay. Yeah, I'll talk to you later. Jesus Christ, Uzis, machine guns, kidnapping, hell of a nice quiet gig, huh? Thanks, Haronian. (upbeat music) - Yeah, White Bread. Yeah, dig it. I ran that plate for you, man. It belongs to the Shepherd Detective Agency. The two clowns are Eddy Fishbein and Moe Rowden. - Call the Robinsons and tell them that four Spanish-looking guys in a van number 2CQN654 just canceled Eddy and Moe's tickets. They're lying in front of 2200 Skyline Drive, Pasadena. - Jesus White Bread, you okay? - I'm okay. I'm following the van now headed for Pasadena. - Hey ya sexy, you wanna race? - Oh. Hi. (tires squealing) Oh! (dramatic music) Shit! - [Woman] Hey good looking, how's things? - [Blue] It must have been a hot number on the freeway, bro. - [White Bread] She was awesome. - What about the heiress? Ever see her again? - No, no sign of her. I took the first exit. I couldn't double back. It's all industrial over there. They must have ducked into a warehouse or something. - Any cash press in all this mess, man? I am broke. - As it stands now, nothing. But I got a plan. - Hey, White Bread. - We get the girl back, keep her 'til maybe say an hour before court time, and I think Haronian is gonna be ripe for the picking. We stand to make a lot of money on this one. Of course it's gonna be a little unethical. I don't know if you guys are up to it. - [Blue And Bean] Oh yes, we are. - Oh yes, you are. Well this could be the start of WB, Blue, Beaner Bail Bondsman Bounty Hunters. - No, no, not enough clout. What about Mason Blue Walcott and Associates? - No, no, no, no, no, no. How about Manuel Jesus Paolo Garcia. - Nobody knows you. Everybody knows me. - Time, time. You do me a favor. You hit the warehouses where they turned off. See what you can find out. What is the name of that Iranian coke dealer who runs a restaurant? - Amir. - Amir. Talk to Amir and see if you can find out who was expecting the coke. - And what are you gonna do? Finish the game? - Uh later. Right now, I'm gonna check on Daddy Ridgeway. And you call me if anything breaks. I'm outta here. (dramatic music) - [Mr. Ridgeway] Yes? - Hi, this Roger Donaldson from the bail bonds company. I called earlier. (gentle music) (car engine revving) - Matthew Ridgeway. And you're Roger-- - Donaldson. - Can I call you Roger? - Yeah sure. - Let's take a stroll, Roger. Nettie's mother was very upset with this business, and I wanna keep her away from it as much as possible. - No, no I totally understand. Murder and kidnapping, that's gotta be devastating. - Well let's not over dramatize this, Roger. I mean I'm sure we'll hear from Nettie before too long. We always do. - Mr. Ridgeway, what do, what do the police say? Do they have any clues? - I don't want the police brought in on this at all. - What? You mean the police don't know? - At least until I make sure this isn't another one of Nettie's pranks. - Pranks? Not two hours ago, I saw two guys sprawled in your driveway. Your daughter is kidnapped by four guys with Uzi machine guns, and you're standing here telling me you think it's a prank. And the police don't know. - That's right. And as long as we don't do anything rash, they'll never know. - What about the two stiffs? - Now Roger, your interest in this matter is to make sure that Nettie appears in court at the appointed hour. Is that correct? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. - All right, I'll make a deal with you, Roger. You forget everything you saw here today, and I'll give you my personal guarantee that Nettie will be there. Do we have a deal? - Well um, I'm gonna have to have this in writing for Mr. Haronian, you understand. - I've already anticipated that. Plus a little something extra for your trouble. I was counting on you not being a dummy, Roger. - Yeah, that's neat. That's real neat. Well there's really no reason for me to mess around here now is there? Like they say, see you in court. - And mum's the word. - Totally mum. (car horn honking) - Hi Brucie, I need some fancy wheels. - Well let's see. I have the perfect thing for you, a lovely Allante. - Sounds good, I'll take it. Bring it back tomorrow. - I just know you're gonna love this. Such a lovely, elegant sound, Allante. You know I use to watch you play. You were one of our favorites. You always looked so good in your uniform. And I loved your position, nose tackle. Ooh it's such a descriptive word, nose tackle. How could you ever quit? Don't you miss it? - Well some, but now I have more time for the ladies. - Oh, well now you. (dramatic music) - I beg you your pardon Senora, but I wonder if you can help me find this wonderful gentleman. You see they see my work and they, they tell me that they rented this warehouse. And would I please contact them for a twice a month spraying and cleaning, bugs. - What is the address? - My Pedro, my youngest son, he eat the paper and he throw it away. I thought maybe you might know these men because they're not North Americans. Nice men, maybe from South America. They rent this place not too long ago. - You should keep the papers away from your children. - I know Senora, I'm very sorry. - Let me look in the computer. (printer whirring) Now then, this is a list of all the space rented in this area in the last two years. - Fantastico. Thank you so very, very, very much. Thank you. Thank you. Muchas gracias. And may the bird of happiness fly up your nose. (dramatic music) - Evening, sir. - [Blue] Good evening. - Here's your ticket. - Thank you, now no dents and no dings, all right? - I'll watch it like it was my mom's. (tires squealing) (car engine revving) (gentle music) - Good evening, sir. Can I be of some service? - Mason Walcott. Is Amir in? - Of course, Mr. Walcott. Please, follow me. (people chattering) - Ah, Mason Walcott. What are you doing in this part of town? - Word in private, if you don't mind. - Of course. My dear, would you excuse us for just a few minutes. Oh if they made women like that in my country, Mr. Walcott, I would not be living here. - They make women like that everywhere, Amir. But now the money it takes to buy them, you can only make that here. - How true. How true. What can I do for you, my friend. - Well last night one of your brother's got his Ferrari dusted. The man's in the cooler. His girlfriend made bail. Now she's missing. - What does the girl mean to you? - I just need to get her to court on a given day. Any idea where she is? - Just a rumor, of course. But from what I hear they will release the girl if someone comes up with some kind of compensation for their loss. - [Blue] How much? - Very much. Five mil. - All right, thanks, Amir. - How long does? - Don't break his concentration. - I've been all over the west side looking for those fucking Colombians. And WB is working on his fucking forearm. - Forehand, Bean, forehand. Be glad it's not his serve. Now that really pisses him off. - You guys know how hard it is to hit a ball like that just right when it's coming at you that fast, huh? - Tell us. - I'll tell you. You hit it one millisecond too late, off the court to the right. One millisecond to early, off the court to the left. - Hey White Bread. I don't come up with the rent, we're gonna be draping a blanket over this net and sleeping on this damn court. Get real, man. We gotta get the girl back from the fucking Colombians. - Just like that. Okay. Saying we find the Colombians. We go in there shooting. The Colombians got guns, right? Maybe the girl gets it. The girl gets it, we lose, right? - Right, so tell us oh wise man, what do we do? - Hey Bean, I went over those tear sheets you gave me from the real estate office. You ready for this? Several of the warehouses are owned by Daddy Ridgeway and rented out to what looks like to be dummy corporations. - That's why I couldn't find no connection with the Colombians. - Are you thinking Mr. Ridgeway is tied in with this dope trade in some way? - It's a hell of a coincidence, isn't it? You know what I think? I think we need to pay a little visit to the warehouses. (dramatic music) Gas leak. - Yeah, that's what I smell. Hey, Bean. - Not the gas man again. (Blue laughing) Morning, Senor. We got report of a gas leak in one of your warehouses. - That's news to me, Poncho. I'll check with the foreman down at his office. - Piece of cake. - You sure you got the right address, Poncho? - 33150 Avalon. Report came in last night at 11 o'clock. - That would have been a night shift. 11 o'clock? It takes to 10 o'clock for you fuckers to get around here? This whole place could have blown sky high by now. - What do you want from me, man? I just go where they tell me. - Okay, Poncho. You go on down to the foreman shack. It's on the left. He'll deal with it. - Thanks, gringo. May the bird of happiness build a nice little nest up your nose. - Another smart ass Mexican with a cushy job. (dramatic music) - This thing really work? - Uh Beaner said it would. - Be careful. (bomb beeping) How much time we got on that thing anyway? - He didn't say. (dramatic music) - Suit yourself, but I'm warning you. A gas leak could be a very (explosion booms) like I said. Like I say, it could go bang any minute. - Do something, do something! Shut off the gas! - Okay. You sure it's okay to go poking around now? - Jesus man, do something, anything. - Okay man, okay. (men chattering) - Fire! - Wait a minute. Those are the same guys that grabbed the girl. - [Blue] You sure? - I'm sure. - [Blue] Hit it. Okay, now what? - All right, guys. Just relax. Here's what we're gonna do. The only way outta here is the exit back here. - How do you want to handle this? - So maybe we oughta-- - Head on. - Okay, head on. - Fuck! Okay, Bean. (screaming) (speaking in foreign language) (tires squealing) (speaking in foreign language) - Fire, fire. Everybody out. (speaking in foreign language) - You bozos are gonna get us killed. - Hey you guys, everybody out. Fire! Fire! Gas leak. We've got a very dangerous gas leak here. Piece of cake. - Piece of cake. - Gas leak! - Who the fuck are you? - We're from the Southern California Gas Company. We've got a very serious gas leak here. So everybody, out. - Well come over here then, man. Show me your badge. - Badge? I've been waiting for this day. Badges? I ain't got no stinking badge, man. - [Gunman] Come over here mother fucker, or we'll shoot you. - Oh I don't like this. Hey man, what's with you? This place could blow up. You nuts or something? (glass shattering) (guns banging) (glass shattering) (dramatic music) (Nettie screaming) - I got a hostage here. Leave now, or we'll kill her. - Okay. Let the girl go. We'll take her and we'll leave. - You leave now (speaking in foreign language) or we'll kill her our way! - No, no! Don't hurt her. I'll call off my men. No shooting. Don't murder her man. (tires squealing) (speaking in foreign language) - This is police business, man. Kidnapping for shit's sake, let's call the fucking FBI. - Oh that's a great idea. Bring the FBI in, the girl gets killed, we get no pay day. It's a great idea. No way. We got the best chance of saving her. - [Blue] How the hell you figure that? - Here they come. (dramatic music) All right, Blue. You take the wheel and you follow them. You stay on the phone with an open line. I'm gonna hang around here for a few minutes to see what happens. - Got it. (tires squealing) - Cute, real cute. (car engine revving) Bean, WB. Listen I'm on to the car with the girl in it. Let the coffee growers spot you. Follow 'em, make it look good. But do me a big favor, huh. No car chases. - Jesus, these guys drive worse than the Orientals. - [Bean] White Bread said no car chases. - Okay. You see, see now this is too good to be true. How about just a little one? - [Bean] (laughs) Okay Blue, a little itty bitty one. (laughs) - Oh shit! - Piece of shit. (upbeat music) (laughing) - [Bean] Okay Blue, get me in a little bit closer. - You want that sumbitch with the Uzi huh? (gun bangs) (coughing) - Roasted Colombians, nothing finer. (laughing) - Now watch this, Blue. (laughs) (gun bangs) (tires squealing) - We should take this act to Colombia. We could be a big hit. (tires squealing) (laughs) Oh shit! (guns banging) - Bean, are you all right? - I don't make enough money to be doing this kind of shit man. You know what I was trying to remember? - Yeah, probably you need some clean shorts. - Oh shit. I was trying to remember what White Bread said, how we were gonna cash in on this deal. You remember? - Yeah. We get the girl, get her to court, collect our fees. - No, fuck the fees, man. That's peanuts. No, White Bread had some other scam. Don't you remember? - Yeah, I remember him telling some sort of story, but I don't how the damn thing went. (dramatic music) (car engine rumbling) - [Columbian] Zalazar is mad as hell. He lost his coke and his money. He wants one or the other, or he will kill that girl. She was with the guy when that guy was busted. You hear me? Five million dollars or the coke. The Iranians, they are laughing at him. We're going to make this work 'cause nobody laughs at the boss. - Well you tell the boss that we are in the dope business. And sometimes we have to cut our losses just like any other business. - I couldn't have said it better myself. Now drop your guns. Drop 'em! - Hey, no problem. No problem. - All right, now untie the girl. (Nettie moaning) (gun bangs) (glass shattering) - Anybody else want to save the taxpayers some money? - Okay. Okay. (Nettie screams) (fists thudding) (man grunting) (man screaming) (gun bangs) (man grunting) (slow dramatic music) - You almost got us killed. Why didn't you shoot 'em when you had a chance? - Well it's an old problem of mine. I have trouble killing people. - Come on, let's go. - [Aram] You know this sounds like one of WB's fairy tales. (snickers) Kidnapping, gun fights, car chases, come on. What do you think I am here, stupid? - You think we shot up the van like that to make our story sound good? - I wouldn't put it past you. But let me tell you guys something. (phone ringing) Yeah, Haronian Bail Bonds. How, WB. So where are you? Did you pick up the girl, uh-huh. You went right over her house, and you picked her up, right? (laughs) WB. (lips smacking) That's why you are the greatest, babe. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're absolutely right. You cannot trust these two guys. Uh-huh. Get it, they're trying to steal bread off my table. Okay, babe. You stop by the office, I'll buy you some lunch, all right? All right, all right. You know you two bozos got no brains at all. What do you think I am, nuts here? Why don't you get the fuck out of here before I fire the both of you. (laughing) - [Nettie] What's so funny? - Oh a couple of buddies I work with are having some problems. - You know I still don't know your name. - White, my friends call me WB. - WB. I love names that start with initials. You know I really do want to thank you for helping me out back there. - No problem, really. - No, but I mean I really do want to thank you. You saved my life. - All in a day's work. - Can we stop at this motel? - What? - Well, I mean I'd like to take a shower and wash my hair. - Right now? - Well look, I've been pushed and pulled all over this city for the last two days. I just feel like my skin is crawling. Do you mind? - No, no, of course not. (bell dinging) Hello? - Be right there. You'll have to excuse me, sugar. I was in the hot tub. - That's, that's fine. That's, we need a room. - 15 bucks an hour. - Oh an hour? (laughs) What do you get for all day? - Take my advice, stud. Save your money. Most guys think they're gonna last all day, but they leave in about 45 minutes. - Oh no, no, no. You don't understand. This, this is different. - (chuckles) I hear that line about five times a day. - No, no really. The lady, she just, she just kinda wants to wash up. - Oh I see. One of those, a Sam. - Um, okay. Um, one hour. And, and, and keep the change. - No movie? - Uh no movie. Thanks. - Well you come on back any time now, sugar. - You know what a Sam is? - Yeah, I know what a Sam is. (upbeat music) (water pattering) - Nice room. I'll be right out. Great shower. Why don't you take one? It's got a massage head, two massage heads. - I would really like to take a shower, but I have this thing about putting dirty clothes back on. - Well I wasn't intending for you to put your dirty clothes back on. I'll just wait here and relax. Don't be long. - You know come to think of it, I really could use a shower. Be right out. (singing in foreign language) (car engine rumbling) (tires squealing) Oh shit. (upbeat music) - [Blue] Yeah. - Blue, White Bread. You wouldn't believe it. It's a long story, all right. I'm at the Stardust Motel down on Second Avenue. - (chuckles) You're where? (laughing) She did what? You want me to bring you what? - Yeah, I said clothes. It ain't that funny. (laughing) - You're God damn right, I think it's funny. You shithead, you. You ain't gonna believe this. Come on. (phone ringing) - Yeah. - Look, I'm sorry for leaving you in the motel like that. I just don't know who to trust anymore. - All right Annette, you listen to me. Your life is in danger. You come back here, we can help you. You take off now, you got real problems. - Oh easy for you to say. All that's important to you is that you get me in court so your boss doesn't lose his bail. - Annette, listen to me. You're in the middle of a cult war between Iranians and Colombians. We think your boyfriend was a patsy set up to take a fall. - Look, I don't know anything about any dope. And he wasn't my boyfriend. I just met the guy. - If we can prove that, you got nothing to worry about. But you take off now girl, you got real problems. You're gonna become a fugitive. - Look, I'm very confused. I'm going to see my father. - No. No, don't do that, don't you need-- (dial tone buzzes) Don't go near your Dad's place. (car horn honking) (dramatic music) Come on, come on. Shit. (whistles) - [Woman] Hey, nice outfit. - Afternoon, ladies. - [Woman] Calvin Klein? - [Bean] What's happening, man? - [White Bread] What's happening is I believe that girl's innocent. - [Blue] Is that before or after the motel? - Now you guys might find this very hard to believe. She just wanted to wash up. The motel was her idea. - No shit. - In any case, we gotta go talk to Daddy Ridgeway and convince him that his daughter needs protection until we get her to court. (slow dramatic music) - Are you all right? - Oh honey, I was so worried about you. - I'm okay. Thank you for helping me, and I, I'm sorry for all the problems I've caused you. - Oh that's all right. - Where's Mom? - I sent her out to the country for a few days. - Who are these men. - Well they believe I had something to do with you and your boyfriend getting picked up by the police. They want to recover the $5 million they think they, they lost. - Dad, I had nothing to do it. I had just met the guy in a bar. It's obviously a setup. - Perhaps you are right. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Cesar Zalazar. - Well Mr. Zalazar, I can only tell you that my father had nothing to do with your friend getting arrested. So why don't you and your friends get off our property. - Well Nettie, it's not as simple as that. I've already started negotiating to sell the house and a few other properties. - Dad, you don't owe these guys anything. They're scumbags. Why didn't you call the police? - Strong words, young lady. But you see, now our competitors will step in and take over part of our market. And they make fun of me. And I cannot allow that to happen. - Well for your information, I did call the police. And they're on their way right now. - (chuckles) I don't believe you, Miss. But just in case, you are coming with us. - Oh God, here we go again. Is this all you guys do? - Why don't you leave her alone, Cesar? You'll have your money by the end of the week. - Dad, it's all right, I'll go. - I wouldn't want you to change your mind, Mr. Ridgeway. She will be safe with us. Take her. (speaking in foreign language) If you want to see your daughter alive again, don't do anything stupid. - Cesar, you don't need to hurt her. (clicks tongue) (dramatic music) (tires squealing) - You guys thinking what I'm thinking? - Same kind of cars. - No, no, no, fellows. Top speed on this is 50, forget it. - Pull in. Mr. Ridgeway, this is Roger Donaldson. Listen, I really need to talk to you. - Come in. - Move over. - Roger, what are you doing here? - [White Bread] Is Nettie here? - She was, but she left. - With whom? - With some friends to do business. - Ridgeway, we know the Colombians are using your shipping and warehouse facilities. We also know they're holding your daughter since I helped her escape. That's my car in the driveway she arrived in. - And those men, they're not the police? - [White Bread] No, they're not the police. They're friends of mine. They work with me. Level with me, man. Those bastards grabbed her. (slow dramatic music) - They've got her. And they want millions or they're going to kill her. - I'm sorry. I tried to tell her to stay put. You have any idea where they took her? - No, but a man called Zalazar, he's the boss. He made a phone call in Spanish. He didn't think I understood. He told the pilot to get the plane ready. - Any idea which airport? - No, but it was an 818 area code, which means-- - The valley. Blue, Bean, I need you guys. - Well what can I do to help? I have a plane. - Great, we'll use it. Listen, call Van Nuys Flight Service. See if there's a private plane taking off. Use the FBI bullshit. You take Burbank, same line. I'll take Whitman. - Underword here, FBI badge number 3315638. Who am I speaking to? (speaking in foreign language) - Let me tell you one thing Malcolm. If you let these guys leave the country, believe me, you're gonna be transferred to Nome. Yeah that's right, in Alaska. - Thanks, Red. Blue, I got it. - The plane's waiting for you at Burbank. - You stay here, pretend you're cooperating with them. I'll call you if anything breaks. (dramatic music) (tires squealing) - Oh howdy. They took off about five minutes ago. Had the girl with them and a long, tall fellow that looked like the leader. - You find out where in Baja? - 10 years in the Bureau wasn't all wasted you know. Pilot made a phone call from here. Used a long distance operator. Easy trace. They were headed to a place called Agua Dulce? - Agua Dulce, fucking bandit country, man. - Well you're all tanked up and ready to go. Have at it. - Thanks Red, come on. - Good hunting. - Not a fucking dime yet. Man, what's Juanita gonna feed the babies? - Don't worry. When we get in the air, I'll have Red call Haronian and tell him to get some cash to her. (upbeat music) - Come on, come on. This is a bail bonds business. There's not a fucking Hispanic charity here. Yeah. I'll deliver a bag of groceries over to his house. But no cash 'cause they'll use it to buy marijuana and wine. Yeah, all right. Charlie, take 20 bucks, no make that 10. Take 10 bucks from petty cash. Go down to the corner the grocery, the one that sells day old bread and bent canned goods. Deliver a package over there to Garcia's. Bozos think I'm Santa Claus. (speaking in foreign language) - I don't think they have a radio down there. - Good. Let's land and see what they do have down there. (plane engine rumbling) (gentle music) - Senores, what do you want? - We're a little low on fuel, and we spotted this place from the air. And we thought we'd land and top off our tanks. - We save some. None of you speak Spanish? - No, no, first time down here. We were checking out some condos in Cabo San Lucas. And here we are. Here we are, where are we? - Agua Dulce. - What does this mean this Nalgado Dulce? - Agua Dulce. It means Sweet Water in English. - Oh, Sweet Water. (laughs) Sweet Water. Well where might this Sweet Water be? - There's a spring down the canyon. - Really, hey you guys want to visit the spring? - No, no, no, Senor. No visitors, private property. - Oh too bad. Well maybe next time. So I guess we'll just get our tank topped off, and we'll be on our way. - I will come back, collect the money. - Gracias. I got 20 bucks says Zalazar owns this operation. If you look to your left, you'll see very new and very, very expensive hangars. From the air, this place called Sweet Water looks to be about 10 to 12 miles. All right, here's what we gotta do. We gotta buy some time and check out what's happening here. And we gotta figure out a way to get down to Agua Dulce. - Yeah, how are we gonna do this? Quick, bro. Give me the roll. (dramatic music) - What's he up to? - I don't know. (speaking in foreign language) (upbeat music) - Great place for condos, huh? - I think it's better for a football stadium. (laughs) - Looks like it's the end of the road. Come on let's go. (speaking in foreign language) - He's sure raising hell with my walking around money. (speaking in foreign language) - Hey, I know you. You're Mason Walcott, the football player. Oakland Raiders! - I don't believe this. - That's me, man. - Oh shit. I watch you play on TV when I live in California. Shit, you were something, hombre. What are you going down here? - I'm here with my buddies. - You, you help them fix refrigerators? - Yeah, we're the best fixers in the business. - You quit football for fixing refrigerators? - Amigo, there's big money in refrigerators. - Shit, I'll give you my best horses. - Uh, horses? - End of the road. If we're gonna fix Mr. Zalazar's refrigerator, we gotta go the rest of the way on horseback. - Oh great. - How come Senor Zalazar no send you his chopper for you guys? - Oh his chopper is, it's not working today. - It's working this morning. He flew over. - Well it was working this morning, but he's having some problems with it now. - Yeah, we'll fix it when we get up there. - Come on. Let's get the horses. - Horses. - Hey that game, you sacked the quarterback for the Saints. Damn, you beat the shit out of him. What was, what was his name? - That was old Archie Manning. - That's the prick. Pow, flat like a fucking tortilla. You ever play any more? - Not much here though. (laughs) - That's good. Not much, he says. Aw shit, he's crawling 'em back. - Teach him respect. - How are we gonna get rid. - Yeah, you know. - Of sports fan once we get there? - I was gonna be a football player. - Beats me, all I know. - But I had to work. - [Bean] Is we're getting into this deeper and deeper. - All day long. - So far, we haven't made a dime yet. - Come on. - My father wanted me to be a football player. - Look at the fun you're having. - And now he says I'm a bullshitter. - Flying to Baja in a private plane, riding horseback on a beautiful day. - You bring us on vacation, WB. But you know what? Your mouth is working overtime. - [Mexican] But I think I've gotta lose a few pounds. - [Zalazar] Now Senorita Ridgeway, I hate to see you tied up like this. I will have the man undo the ropes, if you promise not to try anything stupid. You are in my compound, Senorita. You are surrounded by 100 miles of nothing. So there is no sense in you trying to escape. - I'm not gonna try anything. - Good. (dramatic music) - Just exactly how long do you plan to keep me here? - Hm. (chuckles) Until your father comes up with our demands. We have given him a week. Again Senorita, nothing stupid. - [Bean] Where did you learn to ride? Loosen up on his reins. Go ahead, kick him a little bit. Come on. (gun bangs) Take cover! - [Mexican] Bandits, take cover. (guns banging) - Who are those guys? - Fucking bandit country, I told you. Thought we were tourists, huh? Ripe for the picking, watch this shit. - Banditos are getting brave working this close to Senor Zalazar. He catch them, he shoot them down like dogs. (dramatic music) - Who are those guys? - [Mexican] Zalazar. (horses neighing) (yelling in foreign language) - [Man] See you, it's Zalazar. (guns banging) (yelling in foreign language) (gun bangs) - See, like dogs. - There's a time for shooting, and there's a time for talking. Hey! Don't shoot! - That son of a bitch will shoot you on sight. - If my story don't sell, I deserve to be shot. Don't shoot! I'm a friend, I am an amigo! Hello! - Crazy mother. - Hello, hey, don't shoot. Don't shoot. Hey, hey! I was in the mountains. And guys we broke down, and they were shooting at us. Really, I'm a nice guy. My name is Roger Donaldson, and I was sent down here. I see you didn't break away. - It might work. (speaking in foreign language) - Back to the compound. (speaking in foreign language) (men cheering) (dramatic music) (gentle music) (dramatic music) - Hello, you must be Annette Ridgeway. My name is Roger Donaldson. Your father sent me down here to make sure you return safely after he makes the proper arrangements here with Mr. Zalazar. - Oh, so you work for Daddy. - Well I work for a company that your father hired. Nice place for condos down here, huh? (speaking in foreign language) - Cerveza? - Yeah, thank you. (people chattering) - Sit down, Mr. Donaldson. Now why don't you tell me how you found my place, huh? - I checked the logs at the small airports and your pilot made a call to check the weather here in Baja. - (chuckles) Very good. What else do you know about me? - Well in my profession, you try and get as much information as possible. I know that you're um, well that you're one of the major suppliers of cocaine to the West Coast. And that you're using Annette's father's company to ship and store the cocaine. I also know that Annette's father, Mr. Ridgeway, had nothing to do with that shipment getting picked up. It was a setup by your reigning competitors. (chuckling) - That is a lot of information for one individual, Mr. Donaldson. What makes you think I can afford to let you go? - Well all this information, and some more information, will be released to the police if Miss Ridgeway and I aren't returned to Los Angeles on time. - I believe you, Mr. Donaldson. You seem to be a very clever and capable young man. (chuckles) Well I intend to keep my end of the deal. Let us hope Miss Ridgeway's father keeps his. - Oh no problem, right? - Make yourself comfortable. Feel free to take a bath. But don't wander too far. This can be a hostile country, Mr. Donaldson. (dramatic music) (speaking in foreign language) - Gutsy move, Roger. - To tell you the truth, it was the only move I had. - I'm sorry for leaving you in the motel like that. - Yeah, it was real bad for my reputation. Let's not worry about that now. We gotta find a way to get you the hell out of here. - But he said it's like 100 miles from anywhere. - He's not lying. - Well don't you think he's gonna keep his end of the bargain? - He'll take your father's house, his money, his business, and he'll kill us both. (dramatic music) (upbeat Latin music) (singing in foreign language) - Buenas noches, everybody. - Buenas noches. - [Man] You're a lucky guy, gringo. - You wanna bet? - Hey man, it could be his last time. - [Bean] Maybe not. Maybe we can save his ass again. - Good night, buenas noches. - What are we doing? - We're gonna go to bed, and we're gonna take off all of our clothes. - [Nettie] What? - Come one, now-- - Is this some kind of trick to get me to-- - Yes, this is some kind of trick to get you. - [Nettie] All righty. (bed squeaking) - How about some moans and screams? - Moans and screams, suit yourself. Whatever comes naturally. (Nettie moans) (speaking in foreign language) (Nettie moaning) - Now. - Man, what time is it? - 5:00 a.m., the fuckers finally went to bed. Two of them hung outside WB's love nest until five minutes ago. (rooster crows) - It's almost dawn. If they don't show, we gotta make a run for it. - (sighs) I'm scared, Roger. - Well that's a good sign. - How are we gonna handle this? - Diversion and confusion. - I sure hope lover boy's awake down there. - The bamboo? - Looks good and dry to me, go for it. (gun bangs) (explosion booms) (yelling in foreign language) - Oh yes. (dramatic music) (yelling in foreign language) - Welcome, bro. - You guys sure took your sweet time. - Bean's been rigging a real surprise for his henchmen all night. See this, old 'Nam trick. - That thing gonna work? - Well, Bean said it would. - Get behind me, come on. (dramatic music) (explosion booms) (yelling in foreign language) - That's over a million dollars in coke. - Okay, hurry it up. We haven't got much time. (yelling in foreign language) - You guys get out of here. I'll catch up with you. (explosion booms) (dramatic music) (explosion booms) (yelling in foreign language) (Bean laughs) - (laughs) Ah, you should see it. The whole village is on fire. (laughs) - Jesus Cristo, it sounds like you blew up the whole fucking place. - It wasn't for the lack of trying. (exciting music) (yelling in foreign language) - Where did you learn to ride like that? - Daddy's riding club. - Oh that makes sense, Daddy's riding club, ah. - [Nettie] Get up! (guns banging) Give me a gun. (dramatic music) (guns banging) (horses neighing) - Beaner, move it. (guns banging) (horses neighing) (dramatic music) (helicopter blades whirring) (guns banging) - [Bean] Here, take this. Aim for the tail rotor. (dramatic music) (helicopter blades whirring) - Forget him, he's not important. (guns banging) - We're like sitting fucking ducks here, man. (speaking in foreign language) - Can I have that gun? - [Bean] Where the hell is WB? - Come on. Come on. Come on. (guns banging) (explosion booms) (laughing) - Way to go Roger. - Piece of cake. Bean, give me the roll. (speaking in foreign language) - (laughs) Pow, flat like a fucking tortilla. (yelling in foreign language) (exciting music) - [White Bread] Jump, there you go. Stay down. (speaking in foreign language) - What's the hold up? - [Bean] I can't find the 50. - [Blue] You can't find what? - [Bean] Find the 50. - Give me a gun. - Come on. - Give me a gun. - Here, here. - Lose it man, here it is, Einstein. (speaking in foreign language) (truck engine rumbling) (guns banging) - Where did you learn to shoot like that? - Daddy's duck club. - Daddy's duck club. - Daddy's duck club! (laughing) - [Bean] Whoo whee! - [White Bread] Hey Aram, it's White Bread. You hear me? Over. - [Aram] White Bread! Oh man, am I glad to hear from you. You got the girl, over. - (laughs) Yeah, we got the girl, but it's gonna cost you some extra bucks to get her back. Over. - Hey come on, Roger. Don't do this to me. How much, over. - Well I don't know. What do you think the girl's worth, guys? 150 grand? - No, no, no. She ride the horse good. $200,000. - She's a hell of a shot, 250. - 250. Going once, going twice, sold. $250,000 Aram, over. - I can't hear you, Roger. You're cutting in and out. Just bring the girl in, and we'll work it out. - [White Bread] (laughs) Over. - Look, I'll make it worth your while, honestly. - $250,000. There must have been 10 million in that safe back there. - Say what? Bean, Blue? - [Aram] White Bread? (plane engine roaring) Blue? Okay, Bean. Please, boys. Boys, please.
