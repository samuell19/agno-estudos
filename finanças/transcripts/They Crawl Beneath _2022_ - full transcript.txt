Mom? Where are you going? There. It's in the pantry. - There's nothing here, Mom. - There was. Mom, stop, there is nothing here right now. I saw it. It was... it was big. Mom, calm down, okay? Whatever was here, it's not here now. Why don't you ever listen to me? Mom, listen, I need to talk to you, okay? Our last conversation... Yeah, I'm 97. Code four, cancel my back. You need to apologize. - I told you. - Ssh! See? See, I told you. Mom! Mom! Aah! Mom! Bill, you okay? - Hello? - Gwen. Danny, what's going on? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. The quake wasn't too bad here. Thanks for checking in, but look, I gotta go. Wait a second, Gwen. Can't we talk? I wanted to talk months ago. It's three in the morning. I can't do this. Okay, well, what about tomorrow? Do you mind stopping by, please? - Good night, Danny. - Wait, Gwen. Is there... is there somebody there? No, there isn't. I'll see if I can make it out there tomorrow, but... no promises. Good night. Heard you barking in here. Yeah, sorry. - You feel the quake? - Yeah. Take more than that to shake me up. Hope you don't mind. Knock yourself out. ...just a few minutes ago and immediately pulled over, realizing what was happening. We are currently on Highway 22 just outside of Barstow. Early reports say that the quake was approximately 6.4 in magnitude, with the epicenter here in the Barstow Salt Flats region, We have yet to confirm this, Jim. Aftershocks are a certainty for quakes of this size, so I would expect a number of size able aftershocks to follow. We will continue to track these details and questions throughout this morning and for the rest of the day. The other concern would be that this could be a foreshock to something larger. Only time will tell. Back to you, Jim. You should really get this thing fixed. Why? It's not broken. It's the definition of broken. Ow! What happened? You all right? Something bit me. Damn thing broke my skin. What, this little guy? Hey, I'm telling you, this sucker's mean. - Looks like you got him. - Yeah, he got me too. What are you doing with that? I think I know someone who might want to see this. - Looks like trout bait to me. - Whoa. I'd better make myself scarce. Yeah. Wish Happy Turkey Day to the little lady for me. Will do. I'm here. - What is that? - Oh, uh... I have no idea, but Bill says it bit him. I thought you would think it was interesting. I'm studying anthropology, not entomology. Right, and the difference is? What do you want? I don't know, Gwen, you know, it's a holiday, and I just thought... I thought we could be together. We're not together, and I came to talk to you about something specific. So unless you've changed your mind, - I'm... I'm gonna go. - Wait, hold on a second. Listen, I thought about what you said. And, Gwen, I'm a cop for a good reason. All right? It's to help people. I don't know why you don't understand that. To protect and serve... In today's world, that's really what you're selling me. Why not? If it's the truth. So, what, are you two actually gonna cook a turkey or just drink yourselves stupid? Well, there is such a thing as multitasking. Hey, look, he's my family. - Yeah. - All right? Mm-hmm, he's your family, your family that got so drunk last Christmas that he insulted me, made a pass at your mom, and then threw up all over the kitchen floor. Well... can't say he doesn't know how to party. Can you be serious for one second? Look, Bill's an asshole. And I know that you know that, but you constantly defending him says way more about you than it does about him. Wait, what the hell is that supposed to mean? It means maybe you need to look at yourself in the mirror and decide if this is the person that you wanna be. I'm taking this. Wait, Gwen! Hey, Gwen, hold on a second. Danny, I got to go. Okay. - Well... - I'm late. All right, well... sorry, I'll see you later. Come on, man. - What do you think? - I'm impressed, Bill. Been working on it for about a month now. Tranny leaks oil, it needs a new battery but... Needs some body work. Oh, and you are definitely gonna need a new axle back here. Why do you think I invited you, kid? But you got to admit... she's awfully easy on the eye. Oh, yeah, she's a beauty. You know, we get this running again, we take it up the coast. Maybe go through the canyon like I used to do - with your old man. - That's the deal. You know, this would be a hell of a lot easier - if you had a lift. - We'll make do with what we have. Are you sure you don't know somebody with some better equipment or literally anyone else who can help us out here? Self-sufficiency, my boy, self-sufficiency. You gotta get her higher than that. Come on, look how high the jack is. So, what are you thinking? I believe this could be a new species of nematode. It's very exciting. Sorry, my biology is a little rusty. - What's a nematode? - A worm, essentially. Ordinarily harmless. This particular specimen is unusually large and possesses some very aggressive features. He did say it was mean. This bump on its tail is curious. I've never seen anything like it before. You said they found it on the surface? Yeah, that's what they said. We typically discover new species of nematode underground, since they're perhaps more capable than any other animal withstanding - extreme conditions. - And you said this one's - larger than normal? - It's enormous. Nematodes typically live deep underground and can survive at extremely high temperatures, so they're often tiny, even microscopic. - Ordinarily. - So, what do you think accounts for the size? Perhaps the salinity of the soil? Certain species of nematode need a constant supply of salt water to survive. Actually, I think I can do a saline test to determine what... what? What's happening? Wait, I thought it was dead. Looks like it's molted. What does that mean? It's getting bigger. All right. All set. Yeah, first things first, we just need to get these tires off. - Knock yourself out. - Thank you. Cash! Calm down, Cash. What's the matter with you? Cash, get over here. Come on. I gotta go in here a minute. You stay, I'll be right back. Ed, what the hell's going on? Hey, Bill. My stupid dog over there is acting like it's the goddamn end of the world. Cash! Hey, Danny! Anything new on the scanner? Morning to you too, Ed. I'm surprised you didn't get called in. No, I drew that short straw last year. Well, if that quake last night was any foreshock of the big one, we're all up the creek. Ooh, the big one. Yeah, we consider ourselves warned. Ed, you want me to feed Cash later? No, thanks. I'll be back tonight. I'm just off to see Dolores and the kids. Hey, maybe you could bring back a couple of slices of that pumpkin pie for us. Oh, yeah, pecan for me. Ask, and you shall receive. Thanks, Ed. Okay, come on. What is wrong with you? Back to our yard. Cash! Hey, never too early for one of these. Oh, yeah, yeah. Never is. Don't work too late, Doctor Wu. I'll try not to, thank you. Happy Holidays. Hey, this is Gwen. Leave a message. Miss Bishop, I have a very important development. The test results came back for the specimen you brought in, and the toxicity level of the venom is off the chart. If you were bitten or stung by this creature, you have two to three hours before it causes severe neurological damage or even death. If your friend or anyone has been bitten or stung, they must get to the hospital immediately and ask them to administer antivenin crotalidae polyvalent. You must hurry. Aah! Hey, Danny. Did I ever show you this beauty? - What? - It's an 1870 Colt. Cost me about 2,000 bucks. Oh yeah, that's the... - the Jonesy... - The Josey Wales. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, your dad and I were gonna get a pair of these and go shootin'. Hell of a lot nicer than that soulless standard issue hunk of lead that you're packing. Yeah, well, I've only had to discharge my firearm on duty once, but I'm sure as hell glad I had something reliable and not an antique like that. Hey, if this is an antique, so am I. All right, now you're starting to remind me of Holder. All right, tag me out. Take a look. Actually, this thing is pretty badass. Are you kidding me? Look around. I got my priorities straight. You wanna take it for a spin? I got cardboard targets out back, got ammo in the drawer. - No shit? - Give it a shot. Don't shoot Cash. Yo, Danny. Give me a rag. - Hey, Danny. - Huh? You gonna give me a rag or what? Oh, yeah, sorry. - What's that? - Oh, it's just a missed call. Is that her again? That little talk you had didn't exactly go the way you wanted. So, what happened? She find someone else. No, she said something about us going in separate directions or some shit. Hm, that's a classic line. I don't know, she's probably right. She's pissed at you, though. That's not exactly news. I don't know. She's just different, man. Everything is different ever since the close call back in September with the... you know. - The robbery, yeah? - Yeah, like it was my fault that that perp took a shot at me. Sounds ungrateful. I mean, I get it, right? I was scared too. I don't know. On the other hand, Dad was a cop, and look what happened to him. Your father was a hero. He died in the line of duty, and I hope that she would be proud if that's the way you went out. She wants a family, I... I'm just not so sure it's with me. I'm very sorry, Danny. So you gonna call her? Later. I'm gonna go grab a scanner. Wait a minute, why would you wanna do that? You're just gonna hear something that makes you think you should go in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Aah! Another one. Bill? You all right? Damn bugs, man. - Still bothering you? - Danny, everything bothers me, all right? 249, stoplight out on Franzen and Elm. Requesting officer to direct traffic. Danny, we got work to do here. Ten-four, dispatch, en route, on the way. You see? You worry too much, kid. Yeah. All right, I'm coming in. I'll get this one over here. No, it's... it's just... - Whoa. - Whoa. It's another quake! Whoa... hey, Bill! - Oh! - Bill, get out of there! Bill! I gotta tell you something... Oh, yeah? What? Officer Moritz. Stay safe this mission. - I love you. - I love you. Ahh, okay... Oh, God... looks like... - twenty minutes, tops. - Twenty minutes? Jesus! Oh... Bill. Bill. Bill, wake up. Oh... Bill, I'm hurt. Uncle Bill. Bill. Bill... wake up, Bill. Uncle Bill, wake up. Bill, wake up... Oh... Jesus. Oh, God, Bill. Oh, God... Okay, Danny. One thing at a time. Aah! Somebody help me! Somebody help me, please! Help! Help! Come on, come on. Damn it! We're sorry. All circuits are busy. Please try again later. We're sorry. All circuits are busy. Please try again later. Shit... Come on, come on, please-please-please, please, please... please pick up. - Please pick up. - Hello? - Mom! - Danny? Mom, can you hear me? Aah! Is that you? Can you hear me? Mom, are you okay? I can't hear you. I'm fine. We have a bad connection. - Mom, Mom, listen to me. - Where are you? Okay? I'm at Bill's, all right? - I'm trapped. - What? My battery's dying. I only have a few seconds. Mom, listen to me. I need you to call Holder. Okay? Call Holder, Mom? Mom? Mom? Can you hear me? Listen, If you can hear me, call Holder. Shit. Danny, I took the worm you found to Doctor Wu here at the university, and she said it's way bigger than it's supposed to be, and, look, their venom is extremely toxic. It can cause hallucinations, and, in high enough amounts, can lead to death. Look, I don't understand it all, but if Bill was bitten, you need to take him to the hospital right away. Do not waste any more time in that garage, you need to go to the hospital. Aah... shit! God... Shit. Hello? Hello? Okay, okay. Cash... Cash, is that you? Cash? Officer Moritz? Anybody home? L23, any contact with Officer Moritz? Ten-97, on scene checking now. Ten-four, L23. Hello? Danny? Everybody okay in there? Danny! Danny Moritz! Officer Moritz! L23, do you have contact with Officer Moritz? That's a negative, nobody's home out here. Ten-four. Head to city center, 23. Fire admitted that they received what they could get. Copy that, on my way. Danny? Hello? Danny? Hey, hey! Hey! I'm here, hey! Hey! Hey, don't leave me! I'm here! Hey! Got an officer down! Help me, hey! Oh... Shit. Dad... Dad's birthday. Fuck, come on, help me out here, Bill. Oh. What is it? What's your password, Bill? Come on, Bill, help me out. Oh, fuck. Okay. Aah... come on, Bill, I know you got 'em. Yes. Aah! Come on. Come here. Oh, that's so good. Mom? What the f... Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah... - Any suggestions? - ...another cell tower down at Maple and Hudson. Copy that. Holder here. Did you say a cell tower, dispatch? - Affirmative. - Sure, Elaine. Sure glad you told me that... Meanwhile, I got buildings on fire all up and down the 62, widespread civilian casualties, and a crack in the ground the size of Bigfoot's ass. How about you tell the nice people if they're so worried about their cell phone service, they can write a letter to their goddamn... Aah! Roger that. All units, respond in the vicinity of Maple and Hudson. Come on, Holder... Ask where I am! Where am I at? Come on, man, something is wrong. Dispatch, have you been able to contact Officer Moritz yet? Yes, that's what I'm talking about. Come on, baby, I'm here! Try his uncle's phone and his mom's. Yes! Yeah... aah! ...any other officers out there that you have not been able to get a hold of yet, kindly get them off their asses. We need all the help we can get. Yes! Yes... aah! Aah! Get away from him! Hah! You don't like the light, do ya? Come on, Danny. Where did I put the jack? Where did I put it? There you are. Ahh, come on, come on, think, Danny, think. Aah! Come on, come on... come on, come on... Damn it! Come on, come on... Okay. Aah! Eat this, you squirmy piece of shit! Aah! Oh... Can we stop with the shaking?! Aah! Aah! Aah. That's not good. I... oh, I am definitely... hallucinating. I don't suppose you wanna give me your password, do you, Bill? Oh, you never helped... anybody a day in your life, you selfish prick. I don't know why you would help me now, huh? You didn't talk to my mom for a year. You can hate her if you want to. Wait a second... Bill, why do you hate her so much, huh? Hmm? What is this, Bill, hmm? What is this, Bill? Answer me, Bill. Did you have something... going on with my mom? Hmm? Did my dad know? Huh? Hey! Help me! Hey! Help me! I'm in here! Help me! Why didn't you tell me, Bill, hmm? Why didn't any... any of you... tell me? Why don't you ever listen to me? Mom, listen, I need to talk to you... Your father was a hero. It means maybe you need to look at yourself in the mirror and decide if this is the person - you want to be. - Sounds ungrateful. Or we're not together. Danny. Gwen, don't start. No... no, this is exactly why you need to make a choice. I do not want our kids to grow up like this. I did what I had to do, Gwen. - You know that. - What you had to do... no. What you have to do is stay alive. For me and for us, and not take unnecessary risks like you just did with that robbery. Gwen, what, do you think I wanted to get shot? No... I just... I wanna make sure that you wanna be here. It just seems like you have a death wish, like, what, do you wanna be like your Uncle Bill? I can't believe you'd say that. That's how I feel. Five-thirty-two, you're assigned... I gotta go. Danny? Danny, no. Danny, please don't go... Danny! - Mom. - Danny? Yeah, yeah, it's me. What are you doing on Bill's phone? I've been trying to reach you all day. - I can't see you. - My phone died, Mom. Listen to me, okay? I don't have much time. All right? This phone is running low. Please tell Gwen to call me. I can't call out, but I can get calls on this phone so you have to tell Gwen to call me immediately. - Honey, what's going on? - I'm at Bill's garage. - I'm trapped. - You're where? I'm trapped, Mom, my leg's busted. - I'm coming over. - No, no, no. You're too far away. I feel like I'm gonna pass out. - Danny? - Get Gwen to call me as soon as possible, all right? Say it, Mom. I need you to say it out loud. I will. I will call Gwen and have her call you as soon as I hang up. Bill's phone, all right? And have her bring help. All right. Just stay calm, Danny. - Mom, wait. - I'm... still here, honey. I know about you and Bill. Me and Bill? What? Something between you and Bill, wasn't there? Did Dad know? - Honey... - Did Dad know? What did Bill tell you? What did he tell you? Why don't you tell me? I'll kill him. - It's too late. - What? The earthquake... We were working on the car, and it... - it fell down. - Oh, my God. Oh, Bill. This battery is running low, Mom. Okay, I did know Bill first. And after I got pregnant... well, you know the way Bill is. He just got up and left one day, and he never came back. And your father, being the responsible one, he just didn't want me to... - To what? - Raise a child alone. So... Bill's my... Years later when Bill came back from whatever hole he was in... me and your father were already married, and you were already a few years old, and we thought this was the best for everyone. And we vowed just to never talk about it. So that's why it was so weird. That's why he didn't come around. I'm so sorry, honey. I really am. And yes, Dad knew, and he loved you very much. And that's all that matters, and I'm so sorry, Danny. I really am really sorry. - Tell Gwen to call me, Mom. - I will. - Aah! - And... I'm so sorry. That you have to go through all this. I love you, Danny. Call Gwen. This is it, isn't it, Danny Boy? Shut up. Well, what are you gonna do? You gonna fight him off with your bare hands, Danny? Shut up. I liked it better when you didn't talk. You still haven't learned anything about me. Have you, son? I'm not your son. You didn't raise me. Yes, you are. What's your plan, Danny Boy, huh? I'm not dying, you lying piece of shit. What's your plan? I could be anywhere but here. Having Thanksgiving with my mom or Gwen. Instead, I had to be a dipshit. I thought you were this cool badass uncle. But you're just a coward. What's your plan, Danny? I'm not going out like this. You wanna mess with me? Bring it! I'll send you back to whatever hell you crawled out of. There you are. Aah! Aah! My turn. Ugh! Holy shit. Aah! - Gwen? - Danny? Oh, God, you have no idea how good it is to hear your voice right now. Where the hell are you? Your mom just called me. I'm trapped in Bill's garage. They said nobody was there. I've been in and out of consciousness all day. I should have gone there myself, I knew it. I don't hear. Bill needs to get treated right away. - Bill's dead. - What? Oh, my God. Yeah, and these things are crazy big, and they got a goddamn grudge against me. Are you talking about the worms? How big are we talking? About the size of a goddamn python. Okay, Doctor Wu said that salt water can make them grow, and, Danny, they're venomous. Oh, yeah? Have you been bitten? Yep. About an hour ago. Okay, just stay calm. We need you to keep your BPMs as low as possible, and whatever you do, keep your wound below the level of your heart. Okay, I can do that. Dr. Wu said she can make an antivenom, but it's gonna take a couple days. Hey, Gwen, what's gonna happen to me? You're gonna fight this. I'm coming for you right now. Just stay calm, we're gonna get you out of there. Uh, and Danny... Yeah. I'm pregnant. Oh, my God, Gwen. I'm sorry, I wanted to tell you sooner. I just... I just needed you to know. Okay, Gwen, listen to me. I want to live. For you. And our baby. You will. Aah! Now, where are those bullets? - Holder. - Hey, it's Gwen, look, I've been trying to get a hold of you, I found Danny. He's been at Bill's this whole time. That doesn't make any sense. I know, he's trapped inside the garage. - Trapped? - I can't explain right now, but he has less than an hour to live. - Shit, an hour? - It's really serious. He does not have a lot of time. - Roger that. - Okay, I'm on the way to the station, okay? I'll be there in, like, five minutes. Look, you don't have to come down here. Are you crazy? I'm coming, Holder! - Okay, okay. - Hurry! Danny Boy. Stop. Take it easy there. Come on, son. - It's just me. - No, you died. No. Move the hell out of the way. I can't do that, sorry. Can't do that? A lot of things you can't do, huh? Like take responsibility for anyone? "Fuck us"? Now move the hell out of the way. Or what? Come on. Good or bad, you know I'm your real father, Danny. No. My father was a great man. He actually raised me, not like you. You taught me nothing but bullshit. - You abandoned me. - So what if I did? Look at you now, Danny. You're out of ammo, Danny. Try me. What's your plan? What's your plan, Danny Boy? Danny Boy? What's your plan? Shut up, shut up... - Shut the... - Exactly. This is where it ends. Not for me. Aah... Jesus Christ! Aah! Aah! Keys, keys, keys, keys... Come on... no! Where are the keys? Yes. All right... Come on... come on! Christ, how many of you are there? Okay, okay, how am I gonna get out of here? Come on, think! Think, Danny! Think... wait a second... wouldn't open. Why wouldn't it open? Oh... that's what's blocking it. Come on... Shit. Okay, okay... Yeah... yeah, okay. Okay... okay. I am getting out of here. I need you to roll two officers to Avenue A, just west of Route 45, and get me an ambulance now! If anything happens to him, I'm never gonna - forgive myself. - I need you to stay positive. - I am not gonna let... - Look out! What in the hell?! How are we supposed to get through this? - Hold on, hold on... - Hold on? We don't have time to hold on! Loo, it ends right there. We can get around it. Let's get back in the car. Can this thing drive through sand? I hope so. Come on! Danny! Danny! Danny! - Danny! - Gwen... - Danny? You in there? - Gwen! - Danny! - Gwen! Holder! - Danny! - Danny! - You in there? - Holder! Gwen, I'm in here! - The door is stuck! - All right, hold on, hold on! We have less than half an hour! Hold on, bud, I'm gonna get you out! One, two, three! It's stuck! Pull your squad car up, point your headlights at the garage! Danny! - Pull your car... - Danny! ...Headlights toward the garage! Hold on! Hey, you guys, get in here! I need help! - Come here, come here! - There isn't any time! Danny, hold on, buddy! Hold on. There's no time! Just do what I said! Point your lights at the garage! All right, roger that! All right, Danny, come on! All right, come on, let's go! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Come on, why won't this open? You aren't quitting on me now, you son of a bitch! All right, guys, you're here with me, here we go! No-no-no, no, no, don't go out. Don't go out. Fuckin' make it. Fuckin' make it. I'm sorry. Gwen, I'm sorry. I'm not gonna make it. You're gonna make it! We got ya... - Come on, Danny! - Hold on! - Hold on! - Danny! Danny, you guys, I see him! Danny! Danny, grab my hand! Danny, grab my hand! Are you okay? Danny! Aah! Shit! Aah! Jesus! Aah! Aah! Harder! Come on! Get it up! Get it up! Come on, hold it open! It's okay. It's okay. Dispatch, this is Holder. Where the hell is my ambulance? I need it here stat! They're coming out of the ground. Bill... Bill... That's not good, we need to get him to a hospital - right away. - Hey, buddy. It's okay, you made it. Listen to me. - Ssh. - I don't need to be a cop. Please... okay, Danny... - I just wanna be with you. - No, you're gonna be a cop 'cause you're a damn good cop, and I'm sorry for ever questioning that. Just stay with me, Danny, okay? Danny, please, don't fade... don't fade on me, Danny, please, we're almost there, Danny, please, Danny! For me and the baby, please. I'm right here... please, don't. Pulse is weak, BPM is 70 over 50. - O2 levels dropping - Okay, everybody. - Stay with me... Danny! - Okay, what do we got? Thirty-year-old male, possible envenomation. We got a contusion on the left leg. A bite on the right leg and right shoulder. Any neurological symptoms? Trouble breathing? He has numbness in the legs and arms. Danny, Danny, Danny. Can you hear me? Whoa, this is not a snake bite. - No, it's not a snake. - Okay, then what is it? - What am I looking at here? - It's like some nematode creature, but he said it's the size of a python. Eyes are dilated, severe swelling - in the lower extremity. - I need to know exactly what bit him, or I'm not gonna know how to treat him. Doctor Wu said it was an antivenin - quarter something... - Polyvalent? - Yes, that's it, that's it. - Okay, okay. - He's crashing. - Damn it! I need six vials of crofab and an anti-parasitic cocktail stat. - On it! - What's open? - Number two. - Danny? Danny. Hey, we'll take it from here. - Is he gonna be okay? - We'll do our best, I promise. Dr. Picketts, please report to Room 213, Dr. Picketts. Danny Boy. - Oh. - Danny. - Danny, Danny, oh, my God. - Gwen, Gwen, hey, baby. - Oh, my God. - How's our baby? - We're good, we're good. - Yeah. But more importantly, you're okay. Thank God. Oh, my body hurts all over. I'm sure it does. How long have I been out? It's been a few days. - A few days? - Yeah. I don't understand... What the hell - were those things? - The CDC is working on it. We're literally getting more information every day. Where did they come from? Are there more of them? I'm pretty sure they came from that crack in the garage, and we think they're isolated except for the one they brought to Doctor Wu's office, but they took care of that, too. That's what we know. I've never seen anything like those creatures before. Honestly, I'm lucky to be alive. I know, I wish we could say the same for Doctor Wu and Bill. Oh, God, Uncle Bill. I know... I don't want you to be upset right now. I have a surprise for you. Mom! Danny. Hey, come here. Oh, God... I'm telling you... - I love you so much, Mom. - I love you. Oh... I'm glad you're okay. I have some news for you. Uh, we have some news for you. You're gonna be a grandma. - Oh, ow! Oh, it's okay. - Oh... oh, I'm sorry. - It's okay. - We're super excited, Yeah. - Oh, congratulations. - Thanks. Oh... I'm so happy.
