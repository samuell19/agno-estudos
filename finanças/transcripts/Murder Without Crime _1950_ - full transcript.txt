Murder without crime Subtitles by Seglora Good Evening,ladies and gentlemen and if that sounds pre-emptive or defiant it's because,well story telling isn't my line And heck who hasn't got a story anyway But the truth is perverted and impish humour leads me to while away an idle hour or so before I catch my plane back My story,the eternal triangle It could have panned out that way but it didn't So I just take it at at the not so eternal quartet Well,here it is,Picadilly Circus,I'm against philosophical introductions but here slap bang in the middle of the hub you can help yourself not even if it is just one percent taking over Here success and failure,richess and poverty,open despair I know you've heard it all before and seen it all too but yeah quite close to us perhaps walking by now or gazing at these lights or riding in one of these buses or cars Perhaps there is someone who is headed for a calamitous climatic night, someone who went on brakes, is haunted and hunted someone whose wax and image is destined to graze or disgrace,the chamber of horror Such are the perils of destiny The Teneriffe,my hang out where I pick up the friends of my story and put the gigs all together Of course only the invisible man could tell you the exact how, why and where of it all But I guess I can fill in the missing pieces,let's go in You see,just an ordinary club,no worse than hundred others,no better Just cosy and gay That's Larry the best cocktail elbow in Soho according to Larry Oh,I nearly forgot there is a two piece band piano and drums And always a vacant stool for Grena A girl dated as a piece of Dresdenchina with all the sauce of Worcester Grena is conceit to dazzle with wealth A couple of Larry's specials in the sapphire and the eyes and the pearls of her teeth the rich is enough,so did Helen launch a thousand keels,so did little Grena trad in this crimson robe captivate Steve An author,moderately successful but in the plodding little round of daily life,a sad failure He maintains a punctuality as the thief of time,that's way he is going to step out of now He is two hours late to take Jan to dinner Jan is his wife of course so he wouldn't be this late Poor,Jan,her wings of love have been sourly clipped And in the flat below,Matthew, a pompous indolent lover of luxury When he entertains,his friends whisper they are listening to the mumblings of a distorted brain in the throes of hallucinations Thus on drinking a bottle of whisky he explains that he's taken pity on the government by helping an impoverished exchequer Well,there is the quartet complete Matthew,Grena,Stephen and Jan Two blacks,two whites Shake them together and see what comes out So back to Stephen's flat where it all begun Shut up,you're driving me nuts How dare you speak to me like that I refuse to quarrel and I won't say another word -Not me,bargain -Good Don't think you hurt my pride you could,beat something long enough, hard enough it toughens No bargains,eh You talk it up as one that didn't cheat Jan,darling you're behaving like a jealous little school kid You bring the worst in me You're making something out of nothing, you always were good at that Gail Arnold,nothing Not a thing If I were good enough for you you wouldn't bother with such a sick and raking treat,but apparently I'm not -Very well it didn't pan out,so that's that -Where are you going? I'm leaving Don't be so damned silly I'm not being silly,anything but Melodramatic Not melodramatic,I'm going to have freedom -From me? -An all these imitations,I'll be free of it This fake household All right,march your superior hobby horse gallop away to your precious freedom I hope we both make out together -We will -Jan,look If we don't watch out this is going to develop into a childish bickering match What's the sum of it? You find a few letters,quite innocent ones if they weren't you would never have found them Put this down to the ones I didn't find You believe it I can't believe anything more Think I used to worry myself and love you Used to watch your face and ask myself,what's going on back there? Were you angry with me or I annoyed you? Why are you so on edge? You didn't think of asking me I was too scared I loved you then Too much imagination,that the mill stone on your pretty neck And as for being moody what right isn't Your wretched little prose You haven't wrtten one in years I got one in mind now,a romantic one It ought to be suppressed -Brilliant wit -Forget about your date I perk it,I told you You used to make dates with me And break them You married me Idiotic first love Jan.I'm sorry,Gail Arnold means nothing to me I was just kidding around While I was twiddle my toes Can't you understand,won't you even try? I'm sick of trying You are just a self centred weakling I suppose Gordon Winter isn't, why don't you go to him? Say that again? Where did he live? Highgate, isn't it,very invigorating You'd let me go Sure All right I shall Go on then,go I warn you that smug face is not going to be that smug tomorrow morning That's started it A bit more give and take and instead of thinking treble whisky is faster than an express train she'd been nestling in his arms More often or not this kind of facts are pieces quicken the damn squib but it can lead to plenty Stephen had no sudden change of heart some men might rush after their wives and plead forgiveness,not Stephen A perfectly peaceful guy who spoke the right way when opposed an obstinate mule,hence runs out on him,right now it is OK by Stephen he'll just go some place and get good high,good and quick Hello,Stephen,were are you off to? Nowhere Such indecent haste and go nowhere, come on I'll break your drive me Purple club,why not? Sweetie,what are you doing here? Being respectable Oh and my friend,my esteemed tenant at the moment,none other than Stephen Hault Any interest? The authors are ignorant bushmen Stephen,this is Grena Grena,who loves to revel me for bone and sleep in society You,that,powerful Grena has some weakness for vulgar transatlantic jargon but being our near neighbours we must bear with that Mind you my dear,I agree with you entirely that a positive epidemic plague -Who -Authors Why bring him? To celebrate Look like a sober for anything Oh,yes he is grass widow,you should now Very long? -Is he all waxwork? -A waxwork? Stephen,a waxwork? I've no doubt , my dear,that one day he might be Madame Tussauds,maybe the hall of liberty ,maybe the chamber of horrors Nice fellow I must fly Stephen,I shall not be in until the small hours Witty gambler Two,Bernard And Stephen melted into the arms of Grena Jan throes from the height of heights The setting couldn't be more perfect The moon is out,the stars are out the scents of dew clings temptingly in the still night air And what a night?A beautiful night for romance,any old romance What is a physiotherapist anyway Still we might held Jan to forget Stephen, if she wants to forget him But Gordon Winter is very understanding A little star to this face,a dead pan but here is a challenge she is going to see through Or is she? A guy doesn't keep trying to date a girl unless something is on his mind If she must play with fire,ring the bell But she is still as cold as ice And suddenly that taxi sounds warm and inviting and infinitely preferable of being understood by old man Winter I may get that little quack to make up for Stephen Of course she won't go back to Stephen at once you know cry because of civilisation And so while Jan wanders away from her physiotherapist back at the Tenerife the cocktails are taking their effect Tell me about yourself,Grena? I never think about myself Think now I think,I think I have an unfortunate heritage You? It's funny -I'd known him so long -Who? This guy Can we talk to him about you? Come,come Stuck me on a pedestal That's how every man does for the woman he loves Couldn't patch it up No The pedestal was too high I broke in little pieces How about you? Me? Poor heritage too All my life I met successful people,talented people, stuffed shirts, Only dish up for transparent hoax How is that? She saw through ,it took time,but she saw Head is so troubled? She married not me but an ideal Cut it out I'll cut it out You're magnificent I wouldn't tell lies with my magnificence -I am a failure -What at 22? If you are not a success by then when will you be? You know the way you are going,straight ahead -No merry-go-rounds? -No merry-go-rounds No ties,no regrets -Some not many -Live your own life do what you want to do It's a good code It's the only code -Let's drink to it -Bless -You know something? -What? How unsuited we are -Totally -Nothing in common Nothing Should be a thrilling union,come on Oh,thanks,Good Night Steve, give me a ring sometime? Where are you going? He is going to meet Andrew, he is waiting for me,I'm late I can give you a lift,my car is just outside the door No,I pick up a cab Thank you Who is Andrew? Why the phoney brush off? Max The little fat guy with the sideboards,he owns the joint So he owns it And he likes to keep it respectable Does it fool him? This it? What's the matter,hurt yourself? No,just having fun Here you are,use this Crazy cook Come on lady,your home Let's have a look Just a little scratch,you'll survive The keys in there Bringing back alive, Steve Put the light on honey,it's on the left I didn't know you lived so close I'm just round the corner So I know,that's must be your car Come on Thanks Beauty in distress How do you feel now? Fine No more bulletins Get yourself a drink while I repair the damage Fix me one,will you? -Whiskey? -Anything goes There is no ice,I'm afraid, I lied about scotch,you like it? I was weaned on it The flat I mean Very quaint A pal I used to know decorated it for me Went to Onslow twice a week Twice a week too much Don't you get the scary living here alone? I don't live here alone, I share it with Millie,thanks -Millie,who is Millie? -A girl friend That's her bed next door What are those? My nerves -You want to be careful -So I am Better now,doctor's order Cause I take it,they are sticky Coming away like anything just now Shocks aren't good These for your nerves too,you silly little fool -Here yo -Oh,no don't you rea.. I'll look after these Don't be mad at me,Steve,come on,loosen up I just can't get at you -I'm here -Sure It is not even any waxwork any more At least you could not wax What am I now Steve,why was I ever going to that beastly little club,then I'd never met you I didn't mean that I'm glad I went and you went It's going to be worth it,yes,isn't it? What about Millie? She won't be back yet We have our own friends,Millie and me Sometimes we make it a party and sometimes we don't It's big enough I'm sorry Grena -Sorry? -I can't stay Why not? I don't like crowds beside I had a sick night.I'm old enough,I push off Steve,what do you want me to do with your sugar candy Why don't you Don't make any sense if that's what you are driving at There is so much you don't see You are still in love,aren't you? -Who? -Your wife Grena,haven't I told you to go to bed Go on,go on You want this back don't you? Your cigarette case Thank you very much Come on,let me in I can open my own front door -Upside down -Upside down Don't be so noisy It's all right There is nobody in,nobody at all It's that door up there, come on give me the keys You'll find them on the down this time There we are,look,see Very forward Just what my mother used to say I am glad I came Are you? Do you think you should have done? Must be long past your bed time -This is nice -You say Tedious,bizarre Yes Just like Matthew himself, he owns all this junk Hideous,revolting But not sordid You play better on home ground Come on,you are going face me? So I am prayed of old age ,Grena I'll never grow old The moment men stop lighting me ,I hand in my chips No need to jump in the bay just yet -You know what? -What What we need is champagne makes you feel good I'm not good,Steve,not good at all Why try to be something you are not? Going overdo do you? Well,this is a bedroom No Matthew charge here Dressing table Being so tidy Still if I had a bedroom like this I'll keep it tidy too Would you? Perfect No,not quite should be ice I'm sorry I shouldn't have come here You didn't want me to,disturb you Disturbs me? She does all the time,doesn't she Rubbish That was the way of it Sure this happened before a billion times,the young lovers quarrel She stocks off to an admirer and ducks out and he gets caught in the rebound and he can't And then,then she goes on nursing her pride or if she is a sensible kid,she gets wise to herself and Jan is a sensible kid The irony is that she hadn't wise that quite so quickly Hello Jan Got my what? Your pyjama top,I swept it by mistake, I'll post it to you tomorrow Where are you? The Kinnerston's,just round the corner But I thought You'll find another pair in the linen cupboard Damned my pyjamas Steve,you're drunk Yes What was that? Are you alone? Steven? Jan,listen Stay put I'll fetch you Don't bother I'll come round No,don't do that I'll get the car I'll be there in a few minutes Hello,this is room 77 I'm checking out Yes,now So she's coming back to you and all she has to do to have you running in fifty circles is just to drop two pennies in the slot and I'm out,it's all off just like that Just like that -I'll ring for a cab -Don't bother Grena,for heavens sake be sensible Sensible I can't argue with you ,go on home I beg you pardon Silly of me I should have guessed That this would change your life So you think that's all I am Think you can buy me I throw it you need to undo your cheque book Isn't it enough? No Since you reduced it to that level it isn't enough I'm sorry I can't afford anymore you'd better go back to your club Are you going? Get out Go on,get out of here And you're going,you're not doing a cabaret act now,let down,you're ridiculous Do I? You'll see Stop then and behave yourself again You leave me alone Grena Stand up Matthew,I thought I check my house You want many things above all the stuff that's confined in memory That's why you came up? One reason Another to return this book you lent me May I see if I can find something more solemn Upon my soul,what have you been doing Doing nothing,what? You look like dead You know,getting quite upturned just now I did? Yes,and there wasn't an answer the door I was quite prepared to find you dangling somewhere Why? I heard a scream Scream? The kind of scream a woman gave us when she finds her lover dangling in the wardrobe I could have sworn that it came up here No,I did not hear anything Extraordinary,isn't it? Matthew I don't want to turn you out but Surely I'm not going to do that not before I've chosen my book No,but I've got to go out All right,you pop along and let me select a book at my leisure That is if you can trust me alone in your flat? Can you? Of course Pleasant evening with Grena? I heard you come in Must be an hour No My imagination must have played me tricks tonight It was a friend A friend? Yes I asked her in but she wouldn't So you decided to drain your sorrows alone The sight of this solitary debauched fills me with sad memories Sad,because they are no more Champagne the drink for the madly gay I'll have a whisky Matthew,I'll have some business to do My dear Stephen there is no business which can prevent you getting me a drink? Or is it? It'll have to be a quick one Business at this time of night? It will excite my curiosity Say when I'll never say when I doubt whether all the scotch in Scotland could console me tonight,Stephen I feel sad Anniversaries are sad,don't you think? Your birthday? No,your anniversary too Four years ago tonight you came to live here And I changed from being a well to do gentleman with a west end residence to a landlord by necessity I call myself This house is far too big for one person Not for me,Stephen No,I liked to wander through its corridors Lurch about its rooms To sit alone in the dark and think This room has a strong fascination for me It was my father's study A place of awe and terror and fear My father understood the meaning of fear And I never came in here without experiencing an acute sense of it Furniture It was perfection A large square table in the centre Solitary chair at the head Up there Just where that mirror is You were saying Matthew? That dagger thing It's gone Gone? Don't tell me my eyesight is playing tricks? No,I Here it is What have you been doing? Practising for a circus act? Now,Matthew please Oh,yes you want to get rid of me Jasmine Jasmine? I notice it when I came in Jasmine is a scent,yes it is stronger here Come on here,Stephen,by this ottoman You can smell it quite distinctly can't you? No,I can't I'm afraid,Matthew,you're in a strange mood tonight What strange,Stephen,merely observant And I observe,if one can observe a smell,I observe a smell of scent Your imagination again My sense of hearing maybe at fault surely not my sense of smell And nearly half from this because you insist that there is no smell of scent I insist that there is All right,I've been disinfecting the whole place with it My dear,Stephen,what is the matter? I'm sorry I'm a bit on edge, Jan is coming back How women do chop and change Why didn't you tell me? I could have brought daffodils or something When did you know? A few minutes ago You were lucky about the girlfriend it would have been awkward if she had turned up How careless of you My finger I I cut myself My eyesight is playing with tricks tonight Blood and rouge,what an odd mixture Nonsense Very well,Stephen,a substance I've just transferred from your handkerchief to my hand is not rouge but shall we say a figment of my imagination Good Night,Stephen Now,what I came up for a book,didn't I? Well,I shall pick up and read the first book that I see And that merely shows that I read all kinds of literature Matthew Yes,Stephen Really,Matthew,there are some things Of course,don't think I feel like reading tonight Somehow I don't feel I would be able to concentrate Good Night,Stephen Good night,Matthew And now another crisis Steve's gloves and Grena's flat He'd better get it back or well all I say it was a clue big enough to put a rope around his neck Steve certainly skates on the margin of eternity Hello,is that you Stephen? Why don't you answer? Who is that? Stephen,Stephen Stephen -Stephen -Jan Jan,my darling Why didn't you fetch me I waited The car I couldn't start her up Jan -If only you'd never gone -It was horrid -So we ought to get it good -I know,I know I was a fool Me too -Never again -No Never again Darling,you looked terribly hit up when you came in Stupid of me,I thought for a moment, someone was in here Someone else I mean The lights blazing You must have them left on when you went out No They were on when I came back Are you sure? Were you here when I phoned? The second time No Someone answered it,lifted the receiver and then hung up Somebody else has been in here Why,probably got on to a wrong number That doesn't explain the lights You've must be mistaken about switching them off -Have a drink? -Please Gin? Thanks By the way Jan,where did you "Kill the argument" In my deed box Do you want it now? Yes,I've got some papers there, rather private,you know Sara I say is it a very good idea to mix gin and brandy? I think it's a revolting idea You've been drinking brandy,haven't you? Darling,you know,I never touch it -Here you are -Thanks Jan,since you came in have you taken a book off the shelf and put this one in its place? What are you talking about? That brandy And the lights,I know I switched them off Nothing of bird less can waste time reading books and switching on lights How long have you been back? A few minutes And this flat has been empty for quite a time Hardly time to someone to break into the house Maybe he didn't have to break in What,surely you don't think Matthew Yes,it's me again I've all strange fears tonight and I'm afraid of my own company Jan,my dear you must bear with me, I feel so lonely tonight so restless Why,something happened to you? No,no,it's just that evil thoughts fill within me -You'd better have a drink -I need it -Brandy? -Brandy? You do drink brandy,don't you? Yes,I do drink brandy Is that any reason I should do so now? Give me a whisky,Stephen,please What it is to rely on a drink for true companionship Don't you think so,Jan? Why don't you get married? I have toyed with the idea but there it is,my charm is waning And my bank balance too There was a girl once Where is she now? Married,mother of six Thank you May I abuse your hospitality still further and relieve you of a cigarette Yes If you want to excuse me, Matthew,I'm rather tired Jan Charming If I were ten, no five years younger I'd take her off you No chance? Is my degradation so complete Foolish of you Stephen I didn't put it there You won't mind if I take it And then one night when I am overcome with self pity I'll pop it beneath my pillow Matthew after I'd gone out tonight did you hear anything up here? Before Jan came in,I mean No,should I've heard something? I've seemed to have heard a number of things tonight that I shouldn't have heard, I'm quite prepared to believe that I didn't hear something I was supposed to hear Tell me,should I've heard something? I thought, perhaps,somebody might have got in A burglar? Why don't you telephone for the police Wonderful people the police They look in all the most unlikely places It's probably my imagination I can't think of a more worse disease than imagination Except perhaps conscience I've some letters to write You are not at all your genial health tonight,Stephen You spend all your time thinking of a little rouses to get rid of me I've never been made to feel so depressingly unwelcome as I have tonight But bear with me a little longer I might be rather rather useful to you I met a friend tonight Moving into a new house in Golders Green You know Golders Green all crematorium and not a pub for miles Well,he has a alcove and I suggested something quite simple for it What? An Ottoman,Stephen,this Ottoman No,it's locked Yes,I got some papers in there Tolstoy explains why you do things,such a bore What about it I'm afraid not Why? You always considered it a nice swell and I agree with you What a ghastly thought to think when we are all turned to dust this monstrosity will still be standing He'll pay you quite handsomely for it -It's not mine -Not yours? No,it belongs to Jan Jan? As far as I'm concerned you could take the wretched thing out tonight Can I? Yes Crime and its consequences What a pedantic title But it is interesting, Stephen,listen to this "No murderer can boast that he has committed the perfect murder if the body of his victim is discovered as the body itself is proof the murder has been committed thus the murder is immediately deemed imperfect" Doesn't murder fascinates you,Stephen? Of course it does but it is no one believing that the murder could ever touch them You,Stephen,you can never believe that murder could touch you? But think,Stephen, by some street of chance you may become a hunted terrified creature whose only possible consolation is that one day he may find him immortality in the chamber of horrors Beware of chance,Stephen Beware of chance Now I must thank you For what? For banishing my melancholia Now I shall not go to bed but instead to a night club Any suggestions? Somewhere where my credit is still good Hello,will you please send a cab to 22 Branston Square They are rather limited things, so it'll have to be the Tenerife -The Tenerife? -Yes,the Tenerife And Grena And so the seeds were sowed There is no turning back for Steve, not now,the corpse has to be disposed of Whatever Matthew might suspect,he can't prove anything without a corpse All right driver,stop around the corner First lamppost I do this every evening a method which ensures I get my daily exercise,keep the change Good Night Stephen,what's the matter? Something is on your mind Won't you tell me? I suppose it's to do with the woman you brought back here This is hers,isn't it? Stephen I am not going to make a scene Wish No one you know Jan,I don't know how I'm going to tell you After you'd gone tonight I I went out with Matthew to a club I met her there Nothing seemed to matter then I went back to her flat Then I became to loathe it all before I could shake her off What's the use,you can't explain these things But it's not such a terrible thing you've done Go away,Jan,go away from here Go away from here Darling,please tell me I want to help you You can't I've killed her Stephen Now you know But How? How? I don't know how It's all a ghastly jumble,nothing is clear,not even now I was drunk So was she,crazy and mad It was horrible I lost my head,panicked,if I'd only had time to think to sober up There is time to think now There must be some way out Yes There is The cottage,it's quite deserted, no one will ever find I can drive down tonight and be back in the morning -Stephen,no -No one need ever know -They must about you and her -No,she left me at the club She went alone people saw her leave by herself -But Matthew? -No.Matthew was already gone Stephen,you can't get through with this Leaving you was a terrible mistake, you got to go to the police I'll come with you,it's your only chance No,Jan,this is my only chance While Matthew is out of the way But don't you see Jan everything is against me,everything There is no alternative They'll find out,they'll always do No,not always I know what I'm doing,Jan The worst possible that you can do is to hide this thing up If I give myself up they'd hang me No,but you might if you don't Stephen,tell the truth Tell me it was an accident An accident? Do you think they'll believe that? For the best is manslaughter, I'd rather take the risk It's not a risk,share madness -If anything goes wrong just a few of these -Stephen Jan,go away from me,go away,go right away Let me work this out my way They must give him.. Jan There is one last thing you could do for me Jan,I've I've lost one of my gloves It's in her flat If it's found there,it's Cranfields Mews Yes,just round the corner,number 5 This is her key Is she? No, she is not there Then where? -What the devil are you doing here -My dear Stephen Get out before I throw you out You are possibly angry Cool down, and don't be so hot headed That's better You don't let me explain sort of behaving like a school boy just been caught stealing the jam Well,I was having a little nap downstairs and I heard a sound of a thing being dragged across the floor up here I thought I heard you and Jan go out so I concluded we had an intruder in our midst You see,I came adequately prepared Believe me this is the first occasion on which I've ever abused my honourable position as a landlord I thought you've gone to the club I came back Now I have some work to do,will you please go What is work? I know you are going to fill up your football coupons Matthew I'm ordering you to leave my flat You intrigue me,you've must have been interrupted in the previous situation There you stand determined I should go and here I sit determined I shall stay You are up to something,Stephen And I want to know what All right Mr Sherlock Holmes what am I up to First I must find the clue And I have found the clue So large that it completely escaped my notice -The proverbial trunk -I'm going away Yes,I've no doubt of that How grim it looks already to receive the mangled remains Don't be a damned fool Made for bodies,Stephen,while the tight squeeze might even accommodate two bodies Or that might certain thoughts into your head which might prove rather unhealthy for me Really Matthew you really go and sleep it off Yes,Stephen,perhaps you are a murderer and perhaps I have popped up just in time to prevent you removing the body of a girl from the present place of concealment and putting into this trunk Yes in another two minutes you will be caught me red handed It is a girl,isn't it? Always is You still insist that Grena didn't come up tonight? As a matter of fact,she did But with Jan coming back I thought it was not a safe zone In case you bird it something out She was still here when Jan phoned? Yes And she departed,amicably without any fuss? Yes Shall I tell you how I knew Grena was up here tonight? Shall I Stephen? -How? -By her scent Or rather the amount she uses You should been a detective I flatter myself I should be a good one Now if you quite finished applauding me may I see inside this Ottoman? What? I'm asking you,Stephen,to see the inside this Ottoman Why? Because I believe there is a body in there the body of a girl you've murdered, the body of Grena You're raving Then you won't mind convincing me of my own sanity? -No -Why not? For one thing Jan has the key Has she Stephen? -What's that? -The key,Stephen Thank you Now you answer Who else to rest your strength against mine again? Now confess that you are concealing the body of Grena in this Ottoman -It is full of bodies -I'm not concerned with the number of bodies But merely of Grena's,is that included? Yes,if you like,yes So you admit that murder has been done? It's my duty to see that justice is done And what speedier method than to phone the police In cases of emergencies dial 999 I take it that the discovery of an Ottoman full of bodies is an emergency What makes you so sure that? Because I myself came up here tonight You looked Yes I looked and now I must come to terms of my conscience You wouldn't kill me,Matthew I want? No I pay taxes to provide amongst other amenities the public hangman What do you want? Many things,but one thing above all to deliver over to the Law the man who has violated the Law in the most vicious way that it can be violated Matthew,please Don't cringe and whine for your miserable act think of Grena,was she given the chance to beg for her life You don't understand how it was Oh,yes I do When she refused your advances you attacked her mercilessly Matthew,that's not true,I swear I'm not conducting a prosecution,Stephen, You will be given ample opportunities stating your case before of 12 of your fellow men and it's on the plausibility on that occasion hat your future will rest Wait,wait Think of Jan I invariably do Once you said you'd do anything for her Hasn't it ever occurred to you that Jan might find consolation in my arms Believe me,I am an expert in consoling a woman in distress Matthew give me a chance No,Stephen it's my satisfaction,my pleasure if you like,to hand you over to the Justice You put me so inhuman Inhuman? To expose a murderer You must have some feeling I shan't for her either -You say that now but afterwards -No,Stephen Don't confuse your emotions with mine I've analysed my emotions very carefully My mind,the greatest emotion of all,is fear I'm quite immune to other persons sufferings But you,Stephen,you're experiencing something much greater than I've ever done Because you are experiencing fear and envy you for that Stephen I envy you Don't Matthew,please ,have some mercy Mercy? Could you dare to look in this Ottoman and ask for mercy,Stephen? Could you? Could you Stephen? No,no,no,no Listen to me Stephen,you are going to die, you hear,you are going to die You go to hang,you'll go to hang,hanging Yes,I'm still here -Feeling better,Stephen? -What happened? I'm afraid the excitement proved too much for you Have I been out long? I didn't time you my stop watch is pawned -Have you -Phoned the police? Oh,no,why should I stab a man in the back? Now Stephen please write me a cheque my rent is due,don't you remember? Do you want it now? Don't be tedious,Sephen,I shouldn't asked for it now,if I didn't want it now Afraid that you might lose you money Under the circumstances I should like certain of it Can you blame me? Thank you Now you will be writing another cheque This time for 1500 pounds What hellish game are you playing now? No game at all,Stephen while waiting for you to recover I'll be doing a little thinking And I've come to conclusion that my honesty can be bought at a price Since any sum that I should have required for hushing up a murder, Would be far in excess of you could provide I'm faced with two alternatives One,to hand you over to justice, and the other to let you go free I've decided on the latter course Don't you think one good term deserves another? Go on,Matthew For some time now I've been trying to let my flat downstairs, but I shall let it to you Stephen At a rental of 1500 £ payable in advance,in fact payable now Have I explained everything for you,Stephen? Yes You are blackmailing Blackmail? Why so hurry to assume? I'm only offering my flat admittedly at a high rental but still within bounds of reasonability Good Gracious man,I just had the bathroom repainted blue You like blue bathrooms,Stephen? I don't want your flat maybe Don't be too hasty It has advantages A basement where a man can work undisturbed And a furnace, a large furnace, one of the good old fashioned type 1500£ ? Is that going to break you Stephen? That will do you good to be broken Yes,Stephen It is not a pleasant feeling, as I learnt my cost only too well -I'm sorry -Don't pity me After all I could work Thank you Well,Matthew Just like more drinking than I tootle off I'm sorry I can't stop to lend a hand but I suffer from a weak constitution I wonder,Stephen Will you get away with it? I've no doubt through avoiding meeting the public hangman But will you be able to square it with your conscience Nerve yourself,prepare yourself Don't imagine and above all don't dream Because I'm propping up a bar for the next six months Far better to see pink elephants coming over your bed rail than watch young girls rising sylphlike from ancient Ottomans Yes Yes,it needs a callous man to go through with a thing like this Someone like you,Matthew Who can laugh and talk in the same room as I beg you pardon I suppose I shouldn't be sitting on the coffin Now,that won't do it all,will it? Dear,dear,extremely sacrilegious Indifference, Stephen,acquire it,study it This drink is it full of deadly nightshade? Brimming over You know,Stephen,you should indulge more in the hobby of thinking A fascinating hobby Thinking Think,Stephen,of Jan, truly shining right amongst us but if only she had possessed the priceless gift of tolerance and not left you this evening Think,Stephen,if you have possessed the equally priceless gift of strength think of this last glass of champagne, perhaps that did the trick Transplanting you from a world where all soft and free to a hell where coherent thought was impossible and life became short and brutal action Poor Stephen Face a certainly truth in you to enact in one of her tragedies Stark remorseless tragedy,I wonder,Stephen, I wonder,if I can visualize your final fate Can anyone visualize his final fate? To fate Stephen I've enjoyed myself more this last hour or so that I've ever enjoyed myself before But now the time has come to explain my devilish persecution Sit down,Stephen,sit down, you look so tall standing there What's on your mind.Mattehw? Hatred,Stephen Bitter and unquenchable hatred I've never shown my hatred,why should I? After all to me you represented a certain sum of money but I hated you,Stephen Hated you and with every day I've hated you too many nights I watched you dress up and boast by your conquest of women the might of champagne and caviare you stuffed into your self but it was downright unbearable when one's them is hungry You are not that hard up Yes,I've been slowly starving downstairs for years starving for the things that are my life Good food,rare wines,beautiful women I'm hungry for them,and I've been hungry for them for too long If you,weak cowardly you,you only had to rise your weak cowardly finger to Jan Jan? I'll do anything for her I love her You love her I loved her for years I still love her You've poisoned me No,Mattew,no You poisoned yourself That was made for me,you hear,me But you changed the glasses,didn't you You would do it out of that glass,wouldn't you Wouldn't you? Well that's fate,Mattew, do you hear,fate,you drank to it you fool Distress Grena is not dead,do you hear me Stephen,she is not dead -What? -Look in the Ottoman Grena,she is still alive Look for yourself,and see if she is there,still alive Do you believe me? What have you done with her? Matthew where is she? Where is she? Nice Stephen,you only stunt her, when I found her unconscious I took her downstairs, she was all right,I took her home when I realized you thought she was dead and still up here It was all a joke,Stephen,a terrible joke Stephen,you are not a murderer,but if I die Stephen it's Jan,listen.darling Grena is alive You speak to him Hello,Steve Yes,it's Grena,no Steve you didn't kill anyone,let me speak to Matthew Stephen,I want to speak to Matthew She wants to speak to you Matthew You hear she wants to speak to you,it's Grena Go on,Matthew, speak to her, tell her,tell her tell her about your joke,Matthew ,go on tell her how it ended Tell her how clever you've been,you, Matthew,tell her how clever you've been Stephen,what's the matter Stephen,Stephen,Stephen Stephen And that's how they found him an overdraft at the bank and a list of creditors as long my IOU and a stomach full of poison Suicide the coroner said Suicide? While the balance of his mind was disturbed,the Tenerife? It looks just the same but it is not, Grena doesn't come here anymore There you are I may exaggerate things a little that's our way I guess Oh Stephen,yes Stephen made the grade on his own little racket romantic novels,treacly sentimental stuff all sugar no spice And he and Jan are going feature postcard with farm,a couple of kids and roses around the door.I shouldn't wonder The door seem very far from Tenerife and Larry's cocktails So many peeks,so many stories,some curious all true and most infinitely trivial black and white shake them all together and see what comes out toss the coins,spin the wheel take off the lid slit off when a pipe burst well time is out I must go and catch my plane Subtitles Seglora
