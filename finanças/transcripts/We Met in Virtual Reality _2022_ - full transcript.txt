Hmm, let me turn this off. Whoo-hoo, Christmas! Okay, we're gonna be having a C-hand, if my index would do it. C-hand. We're gonna be having a flat arm with our hand rested under our elbow, and we're gonna go like this. Christmas. Christmas. A good way to remember this is it's a whole day. It's a whole day. So here's the sun rising. Christmas morning. And then it sets again, and Christmas is over. You're gonna be having open hands, and then you're gonna be going in that shape of the menorah, with those eight candles. Cold. Brr. If you're all cold, what are you doing? You're shivering. Brr. Oh, my gosh, it's cold. In real life, you'd be showing with your expressions. If it's really cold, you're like...[gasping]. You're sucking in your teeth. Ooh! You're gonna show that with your face, right? Or maybe you're shaking even more. You're crouching down. "Ah, it's so cold!" Right? The most important part of Christmas or any other winter holiday. It's not about the presents. It's not about the stress. It's not about the finals. It's about family, and we're gonna make sure that we're gonna be spreading that love, right? I know that this year is very hard. 2020 has been kind of crazy. Right now, it might be a very stressful time for a lot of you guys, but I want you to know, even if you can't see your real-life family, you have a family here, okay? And I really want you guys to take away from this lesson that we are a family here. Cheese! This one. So she loves french fries. Like always, she's eating them. Whenever we do video calls, she's always eating french fries, like, constantly. And she also loves Starbucks, and so, she added the two of those. I think it's so funny because, like, if I think of Nikki, I think of french fries and Starbucks. [laughs] Like, that's her. It's kind of hard to see, but this is actually a picture of this person's panties. It's Dummy, and, like, there's just this old photo, and then taken a photo of his skirt being lifted up. And they're like, yeah, there you go. There's your locker. It makes no sense, and I love it. [giggles] [bird chirping] So for me, personally, I have a few different stuff going on. I have something that's called auditory processing disorder, and what that means is if there's tons of sounds going on-- like three people talking at once, and there's music or loud noises-- my brain just can't process it, and it ends up sounding like a broken radio. You know, sound comes in waves, and it's supposed to hit your eardrum, and it vibrates, but for me, it just comes in, and my right eardrum does not vibrate. So it creates sort of like an echo chamber in my inner ear, and it could be actually pretty painful. So I am a teacher for Helping Hands. Helping Hands is a sign language community here in VRChat. We have a lot of deaf members, but it's not just for deaf people. And it was established, like, late 2018. Our goal is to not only educate people about sign language and the deaf community but also just to create an environment where people can have fun, make friends. And nowadays, we have about 2,000 members. Each of our classes can hold up to 60 people at times, which is an insane amount. We have a class every single day of the week for five different sign languages. So this is one of our other classroom worlds that we have here in Helping Hands. We actually have several different worlds for teaching ASL and all of our other sign languages for their respective teachers. And this world is primarily used here by my friend Ray. Do you want to introduce yourself? [interpreting] Hello, everyone. How are you? I'm good. I'm very happy to see you all again. So I am a fully deaf person, and I have been teaching here for a very long time-- since 2018. And that's pretty much about me. I love helping out everyone here and seeing them learn and grow. That's all. [speaking as self] It was really hard for me to sign in VR because I've never done it before, and it was a very big transition. But Ray, he was just so patient and understanding. And he literally just sat there with me and wrote words all over and just sat there. And we signed together each and every single word, just learning how to adapt into VR. And it was such a beautiful experience, just seeing his kindness and patience. And, you know, I started getting close to him. And then, he introduced me to other members until it is where it is today. And, like, Ray is still a really big part of my life, along with the others who were there at the beginning.

And then I quickly got a full body maybe like a couple of months later. So about two years, but in real life, I've been dancing since I was 11 years old. Right, forward, left, back. Try not to move your upper body. Forward, left... Belly dancing in VR is pretty easy because the only parts of the body that you need, really, are your knees and your hips and your arms, which all track pretty well. And I think my community is the only one that does belly dance in particular. In VRChat, you'll see a lot of hip-hop dancers, a lot of lap dancers, a lot of pole dancers, so I thought that I would bring my knowledge and share that with others here. ♪ ♪ If I had 100% confidence that I could make a living doing this in VR and teach dance as a living in VR, I totally would quit everything I'm doing and do exactly that.

[camera shutter clicks] Beautiful. Good job, everybody. You guys did amazing today. - Yes. Yeah. - Oh! Oh, oh, oh! [gasps] You did it. You did it. I really want to have my classes become a little bit bigger. It's kind of dwindled down lately. I have, like, maybe two continuing students, which is better than nothing, but it's so much more fun when there's a lot of us getting together and dancing. [overlapping chatter] - That's right. [blows raspberry] - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll get a DM later. Don't worry about it. - [chuckles] I'll get a DM? Okay, a DM at, like, 1:00 a.m. - Yeah, a happy birthday DM.

You come into VR, nobody knows who you are. Nobody cares who you were. They just know who you are now, how you treat them, how you speak to them.

I unmuted in August... - August. - On the 9th, and if I'm being completely honest, it was because of her. I didn't feel like I had enough anxiety to keep me silent anymore, and a lot, if not all of that, is because of her. She gave me lots and lots of confidence, and she made me feel comfortable in my own skin, not just as Toaster but as me. I've never been so sure of a decision in my life. I'm very, very glad that I unmuted to you. - And now, he can't stop talking.

[soft piano music] - Oh, wow. That was lousy. I... - I mean... I remember I did a move. So when I dance, I slide a lot on my knees. And, like, I was very new to dancing, so I didn't know my play space area. So I slid on my knees, and I slid right into a wall. And my nose started bleeding while I was dancing, so I was like, oh, no. And it was in the middle of the song, so once I did that slide, I was like, I can't stop. I need to carry on dancing. And then, when the song ended, I was like, "I need to go for a quick moment. "Nothing serious. It's just my nose is bleeding." Don't take my steps. [laughs] Oh! - Stupid ball. Okay, go ahead. Line up. "What purpose does VRChat have in my life?" Honestly, I think it has a very big purpose. I can actually have the most stressful day at work, come home, relax for a little bit, hop on, and, you know, those problems just stay in real life. You know, I don't bring it to VR, and I'm just able to enjoy myself. I'm able to enjoy the game. I'm able to enjoy time with her, with my friends. And yeah, it's one of those things that I'm very thankful with. So yeah, VRChat is a very, very big part of my life. - Yeah, I would say, for me, especially, it was more of an escape. When I first discovered VRChat, I was in a very dark place in my life. I'd just lost, like, someone who was very, very important to me. So I saw VRChat, and I was like, I can't be myself in real life, so I'll just be myself in VRChat, which was very refreshing to me that I can jump on, and no one knew what... Like, when you lose someone in real life, everyone's like, "Oh, I'm sorry for your loss," and, like, they compare you to the death, basically. In VRChat, no one knew that my family died, or no one knew that anything happened. So I just got to forget, in a sense, that that happened, and then I have fun in VRChat. - Aw, that was so close. - When I very first started having VR, I was an alcoholic. I was very much an alcoholic, where I just didn't care what happened to me. I just wanted to drink and have fun and forget about what happened in real life. So there was a situation where I had to go to hospital about it, and from that day on, I was like, I can't do this. I can't drink anymore and stuff like that, but I found it very, very hard to. And what I found amazing is that I didn't need to... Like, when I was dancing, I didn't feel the need to drink. I didn't feel the need to be like, oh, I need to take a shot 'cause I'm not feeling that amazing feeling that I normally feel, because I did feel that feeling-- the adrenaline, I guess you could say-- by dancing. If I felt that craving, I danced, and it was-- it got me a much healthier lifestyle. Ahem. Ah-coo. [clears throat] - Damn, that shit too fast. I knew I was gonna win. [chuckles] - [gasps] You hear the cockiness? The cockiness of it all? - No, no, no, no, no. We are 5,000 miles apart, you know? She lives in the U.K., I live in Miami, Florida, yet we have this very, very strong bond where we're able to be there for one another. And, you know, we've discussed plenty of times that it's gonna be a struggle, it's gonna be hard, but you know, we're gonna try our best to make it work. And, you know, if it doesn't work, we tried our best, but I don't want to lose her in my life. She doesn't want to lose me either. [overlapping chatter] We always tease each other in the sense that if we were to end up together, when our grandbabies, and we're old, and the grandbabies give us that special little question, "Hey, Grandpa, how did you meet Grandma?" we're just gonna look at each other and be like, "Well, your grandma was "a virtual exotic dancer in a game." - What are you grabbing for? - I didn't know where to go.

Thank you. ♪ For auld lang syne ♪ This year has been really hard-- personally, in real life-- for a lot of reasons and for a lot of people. It has isolated a lot of us from not only the people that we care a lot about but the people that we didn't even know we cared about. So for me, I didn't know that I cared about, you know, the random person that is my coworker five desks away. I didn't know that I cared about the person at the grocery store that I just want to, like, be like, "Hey, can you believe the calories in this granola bar?" Like, all that little stuff. I didn't believe I cared about the waitress at the restaurant that we used to go out every week. And I didn't believe I cared about my hairdresser. Oh, I really care about my hairdresser. I really care about my manicurist. I hope they're doing well. I really hope they're doing well, and I hope they're back in business when we all get a vaccine. You don't want to see the state of my nails and hair right now. On top of all of that, the thing that has kept me grounded and the thing that has kept me sane has been VR and the VRChat community.

Like, I don't even skip a beat anymore interacting with, you know, basically our, like, little space dogs. Just boop the nose. Just boop the nose. Boop. But yeah. I don't know, it's such a fun thing to be able to experience, you know, yourself in different environments than you would normally go into. You know, it may be at different heights than you normally are, you know, different embodiments. There's so many things you can do in VR that form amazing and really meaningful memories. - I wanted to be a-- an anime female character. Someone may say, "Well, that's wrong "'cause, like, you're a guy "with a very long beard, "very much not anything like that character. Why would you even do that? That's lying to us." Like, no. No, no, no, this is my expression of myself. - The ability to be lots of different avatars allows us to see different aspects of ourselves in a lot of different ways. In my case, I am nonbinary, and being in VRChat means that I can run around as a space dog, as a, uh, a deer, as a Nargacuga, as a--you know, like any number of different avatars that I collect across different worlds or that I make myself. And it doesn't mean that misgendering doesn't happen or that assumptions aren't made about gender or sexuality, because they do. They certainly happen a lot, but there's a little bit of a sense of having... just--just that... just a little bit more control over how you might represent yourself and a little bit more fluidity in representation that is harder to achieve in real life because of the expectations of society and how people see you. - I think the community is continuing to figure out where it wants to go and kind of grow and progress and continue to have fun while also, you know, recognizing that we have a responsibility to make VR somewhere that everyone feels welcome and somewhere that everyone can find a place to hang out and grow and enjoy the social company of others. [crickets chirping] [engine starts] - Yay! Oh! Uh-oh! Health. How do you sign "health"? How do you sign "health"? Health. Yes, yes. Yes. Health, health, or health. Healthy. You have a Y at the end. Healthy. "I'm strong. I'm healthy." Mm-hmm, or health. I feel like even communities that aren't, like, made for mental health support can still be a really big mental health support, and I try really hard to have that same sort of concept applied in our community and with my classes, where they can feel welcomed here. They can feel safe here. They can feel like they have a home. I've always kind of had this kind of, like, cloud of anxiety and depression ever since I was really little, but I think 2019 was after it had just been like a snowball of like spiraling further, further, further, further. Even though I was trying hard and I had my VR community to help me through it, I ended up attempting suicide in the summer of 2019, and, uh, I just-- It was that moment where I was in the hospital afterwards-- of course, my family had to figure it out, 'cause I was in the hospital-- and I couldn't cry. I really wanted to cry, but I couldn't until I started thinking about the repercussions that my decision would have on people. And I would start thinking about the fact that I had so many people around me who loved me that I didn't even realize 'cause I was, like, so deep in my own issues. I sobbed and I kind of made a promise to myself, like, I'm not gonna do this again and I'm actually gonna get better, because there's so many people who care about me and I have to be strong enough to one day repay that. I was really lucky to find my sign language community and discover the amazing people within it. And I know that not everyone finds that community, but just making friends here is sometimes what saves people's lives or what gets them up out of bed in the morning, you know? - I won. - No, you did not. - And I was like... - Yeah. - You're so weak. - It's okay. - I am not! - Zap. - Zop. - Zip. - Zap. - Zop. - Zip. - Zap. Don't forget: energy, expression, emotion. Exaggerate it. - [exclaims] - You know, "Oh, my God!" Really, but commit to it, guys. - Yeah. - Okay, here we go. Hands in. Let's go. One, two, three, improv. One, two, three. all: Improv! - Let's go! - Yeah! [applause] - Well, welcome to another live improv show in VRChat. Y'all ready to have some fun? [cheers and applause] Yeah? All right. Hell yeah, let's do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm Goblox. I will be your host for the evening. - For professional chicken-- what the hell is it? - Interpretative chicken dancer. - Interpretive chicken dancer. I imagine that's going to have a whole wide range of requirement, so I'm very much looking forward to seeing what it takes to be an interpretive chicken dancer. Zircron, take it away. - Mm! [tapping rhythmically] Bawk. Now, I'm gonna give you a dance sequence, and I'm gonna let you tell me what you think of it, okay? [laughter] - [grunting] Thank you for having me. [laughter] - Only two months into our relationship, Toaster came to fly out to me. But of course, we knew when he was gonna come visit me, and we went to a airport world... And reenacted what we think it might be like to meet up in real life, like, what we're gonna do when we see each other. We pretended that he'd come out of the airport and then I'm like over there like, you know, like, super excited. And then, we'd give a big ol' hug and stuff. - The feeling I had when I landed-- that last plane, and it was dark, and I was in her town-- I was just like... [breathing heavily] I had to remember to breathe, literally, 'cause I felt, like, lightheaded. I was so nervous. And we're on the phone, and I'm walking out, and she's like, "Come here. Come to this one," you know, like 7B or something like that. So I start walking. And then, she's like, "Oh, God, I see you," and then hangs up. And I'm like, oh, no! And then, I just hear... [running footsteps] [laughter] In the parking lot. And she tries to run behind the pillar, but all I see is this goofball running across the parking lot in this beautiful red dress, and my heart sank 'cause I was like, that's definitely her. Nobody would be as goofy as that. - Wearing a red dress. [laughs] - Wearing a red dress, like, just beautiful but just running behind a pillar in the parking lot. That was the only time. - Yeah. - And I stayed there for two weeks. And then I had to go back, sadly. And with COVID, she's not even allowed to come here. Like, my country will not let her in. Nobody's allowed in. We're the only ones allowed out, and even coming back is iffy, so it's really tough right now. So with a long-distance relationship, having VR is a gamechanger. I don't think we'd be as close as we are, and I don't think we would have gotten as close. I don't know if we'd even have hit it off like we did because I would act a different way. She probably acts a different way to, like, someone new that you meet, you know? Now that our feelings, you know, are very, very surefire and I know that I love her and I know that I want to, you know, keep being with her and making this work and eventually, you know, not have to rely on VR one day. 100% in the future, as soon as it's available, I'm going to her, she's coming to me. I miss her more than anything. - No way around it. - Yeah, you know, just after two weeks, you know, I know I belong with her. I need to have her in my life, more than just VR.

The good thing about, like, me and you is I find you very similar to myself, so whenever I make something for you, I have a feeling you will like it. And you're just very appreciative.

I told you. - Give me a second. - Like you've never seen before. - Take it all in, every feature. - And you wanted blue eyes. I love blue eyes. - Yeah, I changed it up. I bumped into them. - Head up, and then... And then, spin. - Yas, queen. Spin it. This is like a total, like, new model for you. - Yeah, this is like completely different, even the base, the head-- the only thing that stayed the same was the horns. - Yeah, which of course, you're gotta get the tail, but I didn't want to put it on this model. There was no way I was gonna be able to work out how to do a tail with a dress. I was like, I have to leave it. - Yeah. - We tested her out in the world as well. She matches beautifully, so you'll be perfect. She's ready to go when you are. - And then, in the middle, is a hot dog. - I have never tried a croissant hot dog. Oh, oh. We're ready. - We're going. [birds chirping] - Oh, I think it's supposed to be, like, a blackboard, so you can grab the ends and stuff right there. - I did this, ASL, and then the assistive lessons. - Okay, thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it, you guys. [laughs] I know it's, uh, awkward and weird. This is my first time teaching here. I'm trying my best being a sub for Ray, so bear with me, okay? Next sign, there's two signs for this. You could either sign it like this. You point to your head-- point to your head-- and you pull the thought out of your head and you mix it all up, 'cause you're confused. You pull that thought out of your head, and you mix it. You're all confused. You get all your thoughts all jumbled. Cry. Cry, cry, cry, cry. Show your tears, or if you're really crying. "Oh, I'm crying a lot." Crying. This is tons and tons of tears, or just a little bit of tears. Cry, cry, cry. Cry, cry, cry. Okay. How do I pronounce your name? TheThirdR? - Yes. - Mm-hmm. - Hello. - Hello! - How do I sign "similar"? - Mm. Mm, that's a good question. So same, the sign for same is like this. You have a "Y" hand. You're showing same. So you're connecting. But if you want to say they're kind of-- you can say they're the same, they're similar, or you could use this. This means "also." Does that make sense? Yeah, they're separate. Separate, yeah. - Thank you. - You don't have to go over all of them, but like different signs for, like, sexual orientation. So, like, bisexual. - Oh, like queer signs? - Yeah, like queer signs. Yeah, like, in your class, or just, like-- - Yeah, I could do a quick one real quick. Sure, yeah. - Thanks. - We'll just go through a few. Yeah, well, one--one that's good to know is "queer." It's literally a rainbow. Rainbow. Rainbow. That's how you sign rainbow or queer. Queer. And then one of my favorite signs overall is this sign. And this sign means trans. And the reason why I love it so much is it means beautiful heart and change of heart. So instead of signing beautiful--beautiful-- you're doing that same hand movement, but on your chest. Yep, yep. So your heart is pure and beautiful, just like that. And that means trans. [wind whooshing] [leaves rustling] - [interpreting] I really have no idea. It's, like... it's kind of hard for me to understand. But I was just so focused on my work, focused on my students, focused on my social life, focused on everything else in my life. I got a phone call. And you know, of course, me being deaf, I couldn't hear. But I was still able to feel my phone vibrating. I took off my VR headset, and I saw that the call was from my mother. I was like, "Oh," you know, "what's up?" I really didn't know what was going on. When I answered the call, I was able to see. My mother explained that my brother had passed away. And I asked if he had passed from coronavirus, and she said no. And see, my brother has a problem. He has a lot of depression. And he struggled for a long time in his life. I asked what was wrong, what had happened. I was concerned over everything. There was one problem in particular that... He had--[sputters] he had committed suicide. And he had ended up taking his own life. And it was a really big surprise for me. I was really, really surprised. I-I couldn't express my feelings. I didn't know what happened. And my mom also had no idea what had happened. It was my first time experiencing this. I don't know what to say, really. I just felt helpless. I realized that people actually planned to surprise me with flowers in my Helping Hands community. Uh... they wanted to support me because of my loss of my brother. And they were very sincere in telling me that they really loved me. And they understood the love of my brother, as well, and the pain that I must have been going through. All of the people in the community, I just-- I love so much. They're such incredible people. And I had a box of flowers arrive to my door. My mom was so surprised as well. She's like, "Who sent this to you?" And I said, "It was Helping Hands." And she was so happy as well. My mom just felt-- I don't know. She was so emotional, you know. [speaking as self] Hearing that your mother also enjoyed it, it makes it completely worth it. And I'm really happy that you were able to get that and feel a little bit better. So yeah, I hope that you can see just how many people love you. You're-- you're very, very valued. You're very valid and just loved in this community, yeah. [gentle music] [interpreting] We can come together and support each other through our community, whether it's Helping Hands or anything. And I really hope that the people who are deaf and come here to this community, or students, or anyone-- I hope that they can receive help from our Deaf community here. And I really want them to know that they're loved. I really love all of you. This community means a lot to me. And I want people to know that they can come to VRChat and feel that same love. ♪ ♪ [stirring music] ♪ ♪ [insects chirping] [blades whirring] [upbeat dance music] ♪ ♪ [soft piano playing "Claire de Lune"] ♪ ♪ ["Claire de Lune" continues] ♪ ♪ - Yeah. - There we go.

Our way of showing each other that, "Hey, you know what? We waited a year and five months." You know, it's not about, "Oh, my God," we started dating two weeks, and then, "Oh, my God, let's have a VRChat wedding just for the meme of it." - The way I saw this wedding is that we promised to each other that we are going to see each other. We are going to get married in the future, is basically-- and it's basically a guarantee for us that we are moving forward with our lives, for getting ready for our real lives. And I feel like that's what the wedding mainly is, is us committing and going-- definitely doing this. - Yeah. - It's the exact same as waltz. It's just, the timing's different. So you still have the same box step. You still have the same turn. The timing goes like this. So followers, we're going to start on our right leg. Leaders, on your left, going forward.

My tweet got over 32,000 views and, like, 400 likes. So this was a big deal to me, because people all over the Internet, all over the world, were paying attention to what I posted and saying that it was, like, genius, that it was like a first-time-ever kind of thing. So I felt like, for the first time, me teaching dance in VR, I actually did something. I changed something, and I motivated people to learn to dance. And I even got new students from that. So it was amazing. The last time I got to see Toaster was in October. And I think in November, shortly after he came to visit me in America, Canada closed off its borders, and so did America. And it's been this long up until now, which is August, that I will get to see him again. Because on August 9th, the Canadian government opened its borders. So I decided to get a ticket as soon as possible, 'cause I miss him so much. So I am gonna fly out there in about nine days from now and see him--see him again. So now I get to go through the nerves that he went through when he came to visit me. [laughs] I'm super excited. I'm so nervous though. - I'm excited. - But mostly, I'm just excited. Yeah. - Mm-hmm. I'm nervous. The closer it gets, the more nervous I get. But the closer you get-- - Why are you nervous? What are you nervous about? - Why am I nervous? - Yeah. - Because I'm nervous for the time that you have to go back. - Oh. - I don't want you to leave. - [laughs] - You're like under-- - This is a little bit-- - You gotta scooch back a bit. You were good. - Like this? I have my Kindle. I have--like, listen to a brain freeze playlist. - Mm-hmm. Get all the nostalgia songs in. - Yeah, get all the nostalgic songs. It'll be interesting to see how people are traveling with their masks on and stuff. - Yeah. - Are you going to just pick me up... - You're so clingy. - And take me home? Are we going anywhere? - No, you'll probably be starving, for one. - Well, I thought we were gonna go to Tim Hortons and get a Timbit and donut. - Yeah. And it-- - Right? - [laughs] Yeah. - Okay. [plane engines winding down] [crickets chirping] [water lapping softly] - What I found through my experiences with relationships in VR is that sometimes not being able to touch or feel the person that you love, in a way, gives you much more appreciation for them as a person. You fall in love purely with their personality. The--the one that I love the most in my life in VR, I met them, and I didn't even see their face. I didn't know anything about them besides just their pure personality, you know. I get to know them as a person, as who they are, instead of, oh, they smell nice, or ooh, their hair is nice, or ooh, you know, whatever. Anything like this, it's subjective. When you're in VR, you just see a person purely as they are. And you know, that's not to say that people don't hide who they are or pretend to be somebody they're not. But I feel that, through my experiences, I've connected with people so much deeper in VR just because people are so open and true to themselves, you know. The circumstance and how you meet somebody-- it doesn't define your relationship at all, because you can't control that. You can't control who you were born to. You can't control what circumstance your family is, or how you meet the people around you. But you can control how you react and how you want to continue a relationship with these people. And I think that's why I value VR relationships so much, just because it is so raw and beautiful and true. And I wish more people would see that and be more open to it. Because I feel like a lot of people are close-minded to that, which is a shame. But yeah, I respect that nonetheless. [laughs] [engine revving] I wish the clouds would move. I'm not, like, floating or, like, half in the ground, am I? [dog whines] Yeah, but I'm actually just sitting in my living room. [laughs] I'm enjoying this beach scenery, but I'm just in my living room, on the carpet. Yeah, it's a carpet. This is my carpet floor right now. Here's my sofa. I, uh, sink into it.
