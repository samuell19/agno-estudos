(melancholic guitar music) (suspenseful music) (waves crash) (peaceful orchestral music) (moody orchestral music) (siren wails) (engine rumbles) (siren wails) (melancholic orchestral music) (engine rumbles) (peaceful orchestral music) - Alright, you can call off the search. I think it's pretty certain our escapee wasn't successful in getting away. If he didn't drown, then I'll wager the sharks got him. However, send the shore patrol and search the coast. (peaceful orchestral music) - It's alright, you are safe now. - But how did I get here? - I brought you here. - But how did I get out of the sea? My head. - Yes, it's quite bad. I thought you were dead when I found you in the water. There were patrols searching all around the island. You escaped from there, didn't you? - But why should you help me? Aren't you afraid? (woman chuckles) - That you are a dangerous criminal, you may kill me or something? - Yes, I could be. (woman chuckles) - Right now you are not capable of hurting anybody. I'll worry about that when you get well. - Thank you. - Come on, drink the rest of the coffee, and I'll bring you some food. I must go and make sure there is no one looking around the house for you. I'll be back. - Soon? - Mm, yes. Soon. (telephone rings) Hello. Oh, it's you, Herman. No, I wouldn't be wanting to see you. And there's nothing you can bring me. (water splashes) Here, you will feel much better if you eat some of this. - Why are you doing so much to help me? I can never repay you. - One does not always do things for repayment. At sometime or another, we all need a little kindness. - But someone is going to find out. Your husband, for instance. And what are you going to tell him? - You need have no fear of him. I'll see he doesn't find you. - You say that with hatred. - There can be nothing else in my heart for a man who, for four years, has no warmth in his heart, or affection for me. I have been lonely for him, an unpaid housekeeper. A woman needs love. - A man like that must be a pig. - So, you see, I also need someone to be kind to me. There must be something better than to live year after year with nothing than just to be lonely. - Surely he's bound to come down here and find me. And then your life will be worse. - I hardly think he will do that. Once, he fell down those steps, and broke his leg when he was drunk. Since then, he has never been down here. - A pity it wasn't his neck. - I will bring some more things for you to be comfortable. Now, try to sleep. - Are you sure you want to take the risk on my being found here? - Yes, I am. What's your name? - Paul. Paul Montes. And yours? - Marita. Now try to rest. - Got nothing to say for yourself? Hardly the way to greet a loving husband. - The only love you have is for yourself. - That's right. What do you think a puny little thing like you can mean to a man like me? - Nothing. But you didn't say that when you wanted to marry me. Then you were courteous and kind. But as soon as the money my grandmother left was gone, you changed, Ricardo. There was no more love, no more kindness. - Oh, the money was a mere nothing. Haven't I provided for you, given you this home? - Oh, you're so very kind. - Never mind the prattle, did you get my clothes ready? - [Marita] You must look nice for seeing your fancy lady friends, I suppose. - After three days out there with that scum, I need some relaxation, I've earned it. - [Marita] And of course you can't relax with me. - No, does that satisfy you? - I just wanted to have your continued contempt for our marriage, that's all. - Now we understand each other. - [Marita] I heard the sirens today. Did some poor devil get away? - I very much doubt it. I don't think he got very far. So if you have any sympathy for him, I'm sure it's wasted. - I have sympathy for anyone who has to live under your command. Come on. Put this on, I will help you. - Then you took my clothes off? - Of course I did. I couldn't leave you with those prison rags. I'm certainly not going to drop dead at the sight of a naked man. He was soaking wet. Come on, put this on. - Thank you. - That must be a little more comfortable. - [Paul] It is, but what will your husband say when he finds his clothes are missing? - Oh, I told him that they were old and I threw them away. - When will he come back? - He has returned. He has already left again. He has gone into town to visit one of his fancy women. He knows I know all about it, but he doesn't care. And neither do I. Because one day I'm going to leave him and never come back. - Would that be so difficult? - I don't know. I only remember living with my grandparents, and then getting married to Ricardo. (chuckles) I thought marriage was the most wonderful thing in the world. And Ricardo the most wonderful husband. How wrong I was. After a few months, all my dreams were shattered. My only remaining grandparent died, and I had no one to turn to. At nights, I just cried till I fell asleep. - Fate hasn't been very kind to you. Has she? - Nor to you, apparently. - You haven't asked me why I was sent to prison. Don't you want to know? - Only if you want to tell me. Or perhaps I can read it in the newspapers. It is not every day a prisoner escapes from the Isle of Flowers. - The Isle of Flowers sounds so innocent, and hardly a place for hopeless humanity. - Well, they deserve to be there. - Most of them do, but others are victims of circumstances. - Like you? - Perhaps. But then, I'm not going to expect that you believe me. No one else did. - Tell me about it. - I was in a successful business, and discovered that my partner had been gambling heavily and falsifying the books. I knew that if I exposed him, his family would suffer. So we agreed to let him replace the money, and the whole thing would be forgotten. - And he started to gamble again? - Yes, he did. This time, I had no alternative. I told him I was going to call the police. He became desperate and a fight started. During the struggle, he was shot to death with a gun he had taken from my desk. At in the inquest and subsequent trial, it was I who became the guilty man. The prosecutor was able to convince the court that I had been embezzling from the firm, and had committed murder to keep him quiet. - But are you married, didn't your wife believe you? - I had no wife. I lost her less than a year after we married. She died having a baby. - I'm sorry, Paul. I'm very sorry. But now I think you must rest, I'll come to you tomorrow. - I wish you didn't have to go. - So do I. - Thank you. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Paul. (melancholic orchestral music) I have been for a walk on the beach. - That's a pastime that's better for two. Would be my pleasure to oblige. - Yes, I'm sure it would, but I much prefer to be alone. But what are you doing here anyway? - You shouldn't be out here all on your own. It's dangerous. - [Marita] Not if you stay away, it isn't. - Is that a nice way to talk to a friend? And surely you're going to ask me in for a glass of something, hm? - You are no friend of mine. And the less I see you, the better I like it. Go and keep your company with my pig of a husband. - Are you still awake, my little squirrel? Were you afraid I wouldn't return? - Unfortunately, the bad things in life turn up more frequently. - What would you do if I didn't come back? You haven't any money to keep yourself. You'd be lost. - I could probably get it the same way your lady friends do. On my back. - (chuckles) I doubt it. You haven't got the technique to be a good whore. - Obviously I couldn't compete with your friends. After all, they've got so much more experience. - Oh, go to sleep, and dream that you're having a man. It'll do you good. - How do you feel this morning? - [Paul] Lots better, like a new man. - You better drink this while it is hot. - Thank you. You're the most wonderful woman in the world. Who else would do so much for a stranger? - There are lots of people, I'm sure. - Where is your husband this morning? Has he gone to work? - No, he doesn't work today. He has gone fishing and as long as the weather keeps good, he won't be back, at least until this afternoon. - What kind of work does he do? - You'll know later. - Will I? - Yes, but as soon as you finish your breakfast, we must concern ourselves on this wound. - It feels lots better. - Nevertheless, I shall put another dressing on it. Your head was badly cut, and you should have been attended by a doctor. - You are my doctor. - You will have to remain here for several days. And you must not try and get out, please. You have been very lucky up to now. - Yes, more than I could have hoped for. - Then all you have to do is rest and you will be soon well. - And then what are we going to do? I cannot stay here forever. - It doesn't matter how long you stay here. As long as you are going to be free. If you left now, you wouldn't get very far away. We will worry about what happens when you get well again. - Are you going to come with me? - I don't know, (chuckles) we'll see. Let's fix that head of yours. - You are a prisoner here, Marita. But I will find a way to make you free. - Because you are grateful to me, Paul? - Of course I'm grateful to you, but that isn't it. I want to give you love, and show you happiness. - I wondered if there will ever be happiness for me. I'm married and tied to a man I hate. - We'll go somewhere and get a divorce. - A married woman without a passport. It's not so simple to go to another country. - It is not so easy for a wanted criminal to run away, either. The authorities have all my papers and my passport. Everything was sold to pay for my defense. So I have nothing. That is what I can offer you, Marita, if you come with me. Absolutely nothing, except the love that has been missing from your life for so long. - Paul, I love you. - Then we'll escape, if only to make you happy. - If Ricardo finds us, he will kill both of us. - You said that he doesn't care. So what difference would it make if you leave him? - That is different, you see, he gets some cruel satisfaction in seeing me unhappy. - We are not going to ask him. And as long as he doesn't find me here, everything will be alright. And after that, I'll do the worrying for both of us. - Here, you can cook these for us tonight. Herman is coming to eat with us. - Then why don't you take them over to his place and let him cook them? - Tonight he will have the added pleasure of feasting his eyes on you. Of course, he enjoys your cooking as well. - The further is Herman away from me, the better I like it. - I'm gonna have a lay down, call me when he gets here. - And what time is that supposed to be? - [Ricardo] At about eight o'clock or so. - I won't be able to come to you this evening, Paul. He's staying in and we are having his friend Herman to eat with us. - Herman? He was the man who came here the night. Isn't he the one that you don't like? - Yes, he is, and that's why Ricardo brings him home. - I'll be alright, but I'll be waiting for you. Where is Ricardo now? - He is sleeping. But now I must go. I'll be back as soon as I can. - Alright. - You're a wonderful cook, Marita. - Your glass is almost empty. Here, have some more wine. - Come on, Marita. Such a meal deserves appreciation. This is the girl I need, Ricardo. - Where did you get the ring, Herman? - Years ago. But I don't like to wear it. I thought tonight might be an occasion. - Are they diamonds? - What else should I want? - Then it must be worth quite a price. - I suppose so. - How much would you sell it for? - It's not for sale, even to you, Ricardo. - Would you give it away, then? - Why should I want to give it away? - For a beautiful girl, perhaps. Get a bottle of cognac. We've gotta put some taste in this stuff. - Come on, a little drop. - Come on, put some in! He's not trying to poison you. Drink it. Come on. All of it. - If this makes you happy, I'm going to bed. - [Herman] What was it you were saying about the ring now? - I was just wondering what might induce you to part with it. It's a nice ring. I'd like to own it. - [Herman] I might just be open towards a transaction, if the terms were right. - And just how do you propose that transaction might come about? - [Herman] I don't know, why don't you think about it? After all, I have the ring. - Perhaps I will. - Please, God, take care of him. And if it is wrong for me to love him, then please forgive me. And if it is wrong for me to go with him, then let him go free. So I can be happy in my thoughts. - Now, come on, man, have another drink! Wake up! It's no pleasure for a man to drink alone. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Get away from me, you drunk pig! (moans and pants) (dramatic orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (waves crash) (peaceful orchestral music) Today you are no longer a prisoner. You can come out. It is safe. There is nobody there. Come on, I'll help you up the stairs. - [Paul] So your husband is the head guard out there? That is why you didn't tell me about him? - I thought you had been through enough. There was no need to add to your mental agony. It wasn't important. It is only important for you to remain safe and free, Paul. This is the last place they will think in looking for you. Come on, have your coffee. - I'm under your orders. But remember, only while we are here. - Very well, I'll remember that. - [Paul] So he will be away for three days? - Yes, that will give me time to get you lots better. After you've eaten, I want you to go and get a proper rest. The bed is made and ready for you, I have things to do. - But I don't need to rest more. - After what you have been through and sleeping in that cellar, you need all the rest you can get. The sooner you get properly well, the better it will be for both of us. - You mean to leave here? - Yes, to leave here. But whatever has to be done, it will requires preparation. You must take good care they don't catch you. - It will be much worse for you if they did. - I don't think they'd put me in prison. - You have your own private prison. Which I think is the worse of the two. - Let's not think about it, do you want some more coffee? - No, thank you, that was wonderful. - Now, you must go and sleep. Take those clothes off and sleep, I'll wake you later. - I hope you don't forget. - I won't. (peaceful orchestral music) How do you like your first taste of freedom? - Wonderful. Thanks to you, darling woman. - Your coming was my first happiness for so long, Paul. I pray it won't end. My life with Ricardo is intolerable. - My poor darling. - The other night, his friend Herman tried to seduce me. Ricardo was drunk, he doesn't care. - If I'd known, I'd have killed him. (peaceful orchestral music) - Tonight you don't have to sleep in the cellar. You can sleep in bed. - And where are you going to sleep? - With you, if you want me to. - I want you very much. But most of all, I want your love. - You can have it forever, Paul, if you want. Don't ever leave me, Paul. - I won't. (peaceful orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral chord) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Marita! What have you done with my blue jeans? - I threw them out, they were starting to fray. - You did what? - I threw them out! (slap) - I'll tell you when to throw anything of mine away. - I couldn't come before, Ricardo stayed here all day. I had to wait until he had gone to sleep. - He came around and tried the door this afternoon. It was a good job you had locked it. - Come on, have the soup while it is hot. - Isn't it dangerous for you to stay here? I mean, if he wakes up. - I'm just staying here for a little while. I want to be near you. - Marita, I love you very much. And I want you here. But we mustn't risk anything that could spoil our chance together. You must go back, my darling. - Alright, Paul. But let me stay here just for one minute more. - I don't want you to go. - Tomorrow morning, I'll come as soon as I can. I think that Ricardo have to go off somewhere. (moody orchestral music) - Where have you been? - On the beach. I wanted to be alone, do you mind? - Yes, there's plenty for you to do in the house, without wasting your time down there. - Don't you get enough satisfaction with the prisoners you have on the island without trying to make me one here? - Get back there and stop arguing. I've gotta go out, and I don't want you playing about down there. - He has only just left, I went down to the beach because I wanted to get away from him. - Never mind, tomorrow he's back on duty. So he won't trouble us for a few days. - Oh, tomorrow, please hurry. - It will come. And we'll be together. - [Marita] If we could leave soon-- - You must be patient, my darling. - It looks all so far away. So dangerous, so impossible. - Dangerous, yes. Impossible, no. But we do need time to plan where to go, and how to get there. It will be difficult for us, because we have no money, but we'll manage. - We'll need some money, Paul. And perhaps I can get it for us. - How? - I have some rings and bracelets of my grandmother's. I can sell them, Ricardo doesn't know I have them. Otherwise, he would have sold them. - That will help. If we can get out of the country, we shall be alright. I can get work and start all over again. It won't be hard, perhaps a little at the beginning. - If we have each other, it doesn't matter, Paul. I can work, too. - [Paul] We'll worry about that when the time comes. We can wait a month. People will have forgotten about my escape by then. - I'm going next week and sell the rings in town. And then we can start thinking about leaving. What do you want? - Hello, Marita. I came to apologize for my behavior the other night. - I don't want to see you round here. - You're not still mad at me, are you? I want to get something nice for you, don't be like that. - [Marita] I don't want anything from you. - [Herman] Come on, be nice to me, you need a friend. I could be really kind to you, Marita. - Now, look. Whatever ideas you've got in that head of yours, you can get out. I wouldn't have anything to do with you if I never had a man! - [Herman] You know, I could buy some of-- - Next to my skin, I can do without them. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Herman] What are you doing to do with that thing? - You'd better get out of here, Herman. Because I wouldn't hesitate to use this if you try to touch me. - [Herman] You wouldn't do anything silly like that. - Wouldn't I? - Perhaps you would. - You can be sure I will. Open that door and get out! - I very nearly ruined everything and came out to you. - I'm glad that you didn't, I don't think he will come back. - We can't be too sure. - I hope not. (peaceful orchestral music) (jaunty orchestral music) (pants) Only a little longer and we shall be away from here and free. - Just as long as our luck holds. - After Ricardo goes to work tomorrow, I'm going into town and sell I have. You'd better stay down here, Paul, while I am away. - Don't worry about me. Just hurry back. - I will buy some new clothes for you. A shirt, some trousers and a jacket, if I have enough money. - You must spend as little as possible. We need money for food. - Don't worry about the money for food. It is going to be enough. It is going to be so wonderful. I don't think I shall want to eat. - You steal that? - No, I didn't steal them. They belonged to my grandmother. - I'm the one who has problem. - [Marita] How much are you offering me for this? - Before, I look in. After, I give you the price. - Here, Paul, here are your new clothes. Come on, try them on. - How did you do it? I thought you were never coming back. It seemed so long. - Never mind. I'm back now. And I have more. Look. You take it. - Why are you giving to me? - Because it is safer to keep it down here. - Thank you. This is marvelous, I can't believe it. Thank you, my darling. - I should have known that the secret of my happiness were in the things my grandmother left. Now we are almost ready to go. - We shall go next week. As soon as Ricardo starts his new shift on the island. - We can go up to the house now, but I am going alone first to see if there's anyone there. - Alright. (peaceful orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral chord) (suspenseful orchestral music) (telephone rings) - Hello. Who is it? - It's your old friend Herman. - What do you want now, Herman? - [Herman] A friendly little talk and a few kind words. I'm sure you wouldn't want Ricardo to know that you have been having a man in his bed. - What are you talking about? - [Herman] You know only too well what I'm talking about. The fellow you have been sleeping with, while Ricardo's out on the island. - Why are you telling me this? Surely it's my husband you want to tell, it isn't? - [Herman] Well, now, you know. Did I say anything about telling him? I thought we might come to some sort of an arrangement. After all, I'm not a greedy man. I don't mind sharing my pleasure with another. You see, I could forget the whole thing if-- - If what, Herman? - [Herman] Well, now, if you change your attitude, for instance, and endow me with some of the favors you have been bestowing on the other gentleman. Now, if I come over tonight, we can straighten the whole thing out. - You seem to have me just where you want to. Don't you, Herman? Perhaps I will be nice to you. But you must wait until tomorrow. Tomorrow night. And then I'll do what you ask. - [Herman] You mean that, don't you? - Yes. Tomorrow night. (moody orchestral music) (sobs) Oh, my god, he must have been watching us. He knows I have been sleeping with you. - We must leave tonight. As soon as it gets dark. - Paul, you'd better stay in the cellar. I'm going to pack some things I have to take with me. - It's all my fault, I should have stayed out of sight. - No, it's not your fault. I wanted you, it couldn't be helped. But now we must go as soon as possible. (telephone rings) - Yes, what is it? - Ricardo? - Oh, it's you, Herman. What do you want? - [Herman] I think you will be ready to trade. You know, the ring. That little wife of yours has a sleeping companion while you are out there. - What makes you think so? - [Herman] As you know, I take a personal interest in the lady, and I just happened to be near the house last night, and I thought to take a look in. - I'll kill her. - [Herman] I wouldn't do that, Ricardo. I'll take her off your hands. - After I finish with her, you can have her. I'll make her remember me till her dying day. (suspenseful orchestral music) So my little wife is planning to go somewhere, is she? - Yes, out of your way and out of your life forever. - I wouldn't know about that. You're not going anywhere. - You pig, you pig! (dramatic orchestral music) (thud) (Ricardo groans) (Ricardo groans) (gun clangs) (thud) (Ricardo groans) Let's go, he's unconscious. (suspenseful orchestral music) (water splashes) - How long have you been here? - Only a few minutes. You found them together. - I found her packing and ready to leave. - Who is the man? - Yes, the man from the island. Who escaped. She must have been hiding him. - [Herman] Do you feel well enough to go after them, or shall I call the police? - You won't call anybody. This uniform's my license to kill. We're going hunting. Go and get me the gun. It's in the cupboard at the top of the stairs. Get some ammunition, too. Come on, let's go after them. I think it's about time I had that ring of yours. They've gone through the woods. We'll find the bastards. They can't have gone very far. Come on, they've come through here. (suspenseful orchestral music) - We had better go over that way toward the woods. - Come on, then. We mustn't stop. - Just for a few minutes, Paul. - Alright. - Oh, Paul, I'm so tired. - You will feel better when we have rested for a while. (suspenseful orchestral music) - This way. Let's rest here. They're around here somewhere. (ominous orchestral music) Well, now. Look what we have here. Isn't that a pretty picture? This is the end of your little escapade, my friend. And look at my pretty little wife. What are we going to do about you now? (suspenseful orchestral music) (Marita moans) (Herman grunts) (Marita groans) Don't move. (Marita groans) This is it, my friend. This is it. Right between the eyes. Yeah. (Marita groans) (Marita groans) (Marita groans) (Marita moans) (thuds) (Ricardo groans) (Marita groans and pants) (gun fires) (Marita groans) (Marita pants) (Marita groans) (Marita groans) - It's all over, my darling. (Marita sobs) You're free. (peaceful orchestral music) - I'll get the tickets, you wait here. (wind blows) Have we much further to go? - No, I don't think so. (moody orchestral music) We are across the border. - Paul, darling. - Come on, we mustn't stop. We are still not out of danger. (ominous orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music)
