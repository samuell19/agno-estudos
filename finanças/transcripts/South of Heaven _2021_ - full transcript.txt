Would you state your name for the record, please? James ray. James ray. You are currently serving a 15-year sentence following a guilty plea for armed robbery and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Correct? Yes, ma'am. I believe you have some medical files for us to examine, and that you've also prepared a statement you wish to read. Would you like to do that now? No, ma'am. I'm sorry. I don't understand. Well, I had this long speech ready for y'all, and. Been working on it every day for the last three weeks now. I even did rehearsals, and not just like in a mirror by myself but you know with my cellmate, a few of the prison guards, even the prison doctor. You know, I'd say to anybody who'd, you know, listen to me. Sadly though, you're not gonna hear it today. See, life has its own way of planning things. While I was putting the finishing touches on my heartfelt confession about my glorious redemption courtesy of this here state correctional facility, my one true love, Annie, she got the death sentence. Lung cancer. Doctors gave her a year. Well, I ain't going to waste my time with y'all talking about what a huge mistake I made with that stupid goddamn bank robbery. But I am going to ask you to let... No, I'm gonna... I'm gonna beg you to let me out. So that I can give Annie, my sweet Annie, the life I robbed from her. She never let me down. We promised each other we'd get married once I was on the outside. Why wait so long? Well, ma'am, I don't know how familiar you are with prison weddings, but they're about as far as you can get from the kind of wedding a little girl dreams of, you know. There ain't no roses or guests. No bridesmaids and pink dresses. No... fancy food. No music to dance to. And well, there sure as hell ain't no car with a "just married" sign ready to drive you away. No, ma'am, all you get is the prison chaplain to wed you and your loved one in holy matrimony. And that's the same man that consoles prisoners on death row. That ain't very romantic, now is it? But if by y'all's good graces, I'm destined to get out of here, I'm gonna make sure she gets the wedding she deserves. I'm gonna give Annie the best year of her life. Do you hate it? You look beautiful. Liar. I'm not lying, Annie. You look like an angel. And soon to be. No, no, that's not what I meant. I'm just teasing you, Jimmy. Come on. Still remember how to drive, right? I guess we'll find out now, won't we? I mustangs and politics I I let the change and he still leaves I I it's a bag of brown and red dirt. I I you nearly drown and never get home I What? I just can't stop staring at you. Well, in that case, maybe I should drive. 0h, no. I'm sorry, miss. You're not gonna lift another finger for a long time now. I'm here to serve. Your wish is my command. I can get used to that. You kept the trailer. Yep. It was our home. Couldn't get rid of it. Yeah, of course not. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna go inside, turn on the water heater. And you just come in when you're good and ready. Okay? What's wrong? I just can't believe I'm actually here. You're here. But you're way over there. I'm so sorry, Annie. I'm sorry. I know. I know. Thank you. Hey, come on now. Listen to me. Warts and all, remember? Yeah. Yeah, warts and all. Yeah. Come in. Take a seat. Ah, Raines, is it? Ray. Jimmy ray. 0h, that's right. Fifteen years for picking the wrong kind of friends. Am I right or am I right? More or less. Yeah. Why don't we make that "more or less, sir." That's easy enough for you to remember, ain't it. Yes, sir. Good. You just keep that "yes sir" attitude and maybe me and you, we won't have a problem. Oh, boy. They sure gave you full package, didn't they? This whole sorry business with the lady friend is truly unfortunate. I tell you, if it were me, I'd be carrying a whole bagful of grudge right about now. Most men would. Not me, sir. Oh yeah? Why is that? Well, obviously because of that sorry business with my lady friend that you mentioned. I owe it to her to stay straight. Well, that is truly admirable, ray. - But I gotta... - It's Jimmy. Sir. Look, I'm gonna shoot you straight, buddy. Because I don't want to come off like some kind of dick or nothing. And you seem a tad sharper than most fellows passin' this hall. Truth be told, I don't give a damn if your name's Jesus of nazareth. All I care is you abide by my rules. You do that, I'll be the best friend you got on this side of the walls. If you so much as drink in excess... You do know what excess means, right? Not according to my girl. You're a funny fella. Yeah, that's a good one. Having a good sense of humor can go along way in keeping a man afloat during hard times. But I got a rule of my own and it don't show up on these here papers. And that rule says wisecracking is a waste of my valuable time. And I don't think you have much time to waste neither, am I correct, or am I correct? No, I don't, sir. Good. If you fail to abide by any of my rules, well, you're gonna find yourself right back in chains. I got you a job at the loading docks. I hope you can appreciate the chance you're getting here. I do, sir. It ain't much in the way of a paycheck, I know, but I'm sure a smart fella like yourself. Well, we'll meet again every week till further notice. While you report to me as required by law, as long as I see you keeping on the up and up. Well, then you might have yourself a bright future. No offense to the lady friend of course. We'll be just fine. Yeah, we'll see about that. Just make sure you're there tomorrow morning. Yes, sir. Mm-mm. Go on, now. You all right? Yeah, no. I'm good. - Come on, Jimmy. - I can read you like a book. What's wrong? Oh, you know. I got a new job. I start tomorrow morning. That's it. - Mm-hm. - Yeah. Jimmy! Okay, fine. Look, I just got a bad feeling about my parole officer, that's all. Well, he's your parole officer. You're supposed to have a bad feeling about him. Yeah, yeah. But something don't sit right. I don't know. - I'll tell you what. - This, um, what's his name? Schmidt. This schmidt here does anything to cross my man and I will be all over his ass. I'll make grass out of his ass. I think you mean to say his ass is grass. - Yes. - Yeah. That is exactly what I mean. Yeah, well, I'd hate to be on the receiving end of those clippers. - That's for sure. - Yes, you would. Whoo. Hm. All this grass talk is making me thirsty. Smoke 'em if you got 'em, right? Is that what I think it is? The only perk cancer has to offer. Shall we? Look, I mean, if it's legal, you know. Did you ever imagine that we'd have to pick our wedding song and my death song in the same year? Come on. - Too soon? - Yeah, way too soon. I don't-i don't think it'll ever be a good time - for that conversation. - 0h, come on, Jimmy. Help me pick a death song. 0kay, you know what, I think you've had too much of that stuff. - I think you haven't had enough. - I'm good. I think it should be sad. But also funny. Like maybe like the beach boys, "good vibrations." No. I know. "God only knows." 0h, you're killing me. Come on. J' I may not always love you I I but long as there are stars above you I I you never need to doubt it I I I'll make you so sure about it I I god only knows. I I knows what I'd be without you. I Perfect. J' if you should ever leave me I I though life would still go on believe me I I the world could show nothing to me I I so what good would living do me I I god only. I shit. I'm sorry. This here's a bad idea. Please don't cry. Okay? It's my funeral, and I will cry if I want to. I you would cry too if it happened to you I she's laughing now. Laughing, dancing. Okay. Okay. Oh, my god. They don't tell you that. But dying can make you extremely bipolar. Oh, no. Oh. Oh, no. - Oh, yeah, huh? - Mm-hm. Well, I'll tell you this right now. I sure would like to kiss those bipolar lips of yours. Would you now? Yes. Yes, ma'am. Yeah. Well, - this one here. - Mm-hm. Is very strongly against it. Okay. Noted. But this one has veto power and it's rooting for you, Jimmy. It's rooting loud and strong. Keep driving, or I'll blow your fucking head off, you hear me? Come on, man. Fran k? What...? Goddamn. Come on. - How you doing, Jimmy? - It's been a long time. Dammit, frank! What are you doing? You got something for my fuckin' nose? Over, there somewhere? Please. Oh, yeah. That's good. Yeah. Goddamn, I'm sorry about that, man. It's all right. It's my fault. I shouldn't have snuck up on a fresh ex-con. Big dangerous man like you. Fuck. Hey, listen, man. I'm sorry I haven't gotten in touch with you since being out. Oh, shut the fuck up. No, no, no. I mean it. Look, you took care of Annie for me. While I was still in. I owe you. Hey. You don't owe me shit. It was Annie who took care of me. That's the truth. I was a holy fucking mess when I got out. It was Annie set me straight. Yeah, she got a way about her, don't she? Yes, she does. Oh, shit, man. It's good to see you. It's good to see you, too. Where are we drinking, man? - Oh, well, I can't. - I can't tonight. Annie and I are going out. We don't have to do it tonight. We'll do it this weekend, huh? We should probably reminisce about the good old days, right? Yeah. Frank, I'd love to do that. I would, but, um. You know, I'm on parole and they got all these dumb-ass rules. You know? With the, uh, no boozin' and don't miss a day's work. I can't be consorting with known criminals. - And that's what I am? - I'm a criminal. Hey, that's... Well... Let me tell you something you may not know. I ain't been a criminal in three years. I run a legit business now. It's a scrapyard and it's doing real good. And if you weren't such an asshole, maybe I'd bring you in on it. Honest frank? Yeah, you like that? You are honest frank? Ah. Any other life, I'd jump at the chance. You know, no second thoughts, but just the way things are. I... I can't be, uh, I don't wanna mess around with these last moments with Annie. Yeah, so. I can't. - That's all right. - It's all right. I get you. I wouldn't want you to risk that either, tell you the truth. Appreciate you understand. I want you to hold on to that. So if you need anything, you call me up. Yes, sir. All right. Well, if you'll excuse me. I got a broken nose to attend to. Hey. And a broken heart. Fuck off. Mm. Unbelievable. And that is why they have my picture on the wall. I mean, you did have 12 years more practice than me. And whose fault is that? Ouch. Whose idea was it to come here? I thought you loved this place. Oh, no. I liked making out here. That's what it was. You liked making out everywhere. We were great. Yeah? Hm. We were young. - What are you talking about? - We still are young. Are we now? - Yes, ma'am. - Really? - Hold that thought. - I'm gonna go get us some beers. Okay. I'm gonna pick up the spare then. You gonna miss it. Just watch. It'll be incredible. A lot of pins to hit. Here it comes. Come on. Showtime. Shit! Here you go. Thank you. Yeah. For you. Mm. Thank you kindly. Easy there, cowgirl. I'm just evenin' the odds, Jimmy. Now, where were we? Would you two get a room already? I hope you're watching that excess protocol, Jimmy. And you? You must be Mrs. Ray. To be. - Of course. - Pleasure to meet you, ma'am. The pleasure's all mine, mister... Schmidt. I'm Jimmy's state appointed parole officer but I'm sure he's told you about me already. Oh, he sure did. Only good things, I'm sure. I hate to interrupt your date night. You wouldn't mind me stealing this fine fella for just a little huddle now, would you? Not at all. Thank you kindly, ma'am. Come on, Jimmy. It's your turn. Boy, she's somethin' else. Yeah, she is. - How's everything going, Jimmy? - You doing all right? Everything's fine. That's great. I know how hard it is to make a life worth living on a measly salary. Yeah. We'll get by. Yeah, you know, I've seen so many hardworking folks like yourself fall back to transgressions and whatnot. It's easy to fall by the wayside when you ain't got the right support. Mm-hm. Yeah, well, I won't. You know, I got too much to lose. Yeah, that's just what I was thinking. I was thinking there ain't no way this man'll go up and throw away this gift. That's why I think an honest man like yourself shouldn't have to fight so hard to make ends meet. Why, it's in everyone's best interest. That you stay afloat ain't it? What you getting at? Well, I got a little side gig for you. All you gotta do is go by this address, pick up a bag for me; You do that? Get yourself a little extra scratch, stay out of trouble. Everybody wins. What if I say no? Well, that'd just make me sad. And I'd hate to see you waste what precious little time you still got left with the future missus over there. UN-fucking unbelievable! Easy. Language, here. We got kids runnin' around. You keep popping off like that, you'll find yourself behind bars before the lady friend knows you done gone and stuck her with the bill. Hell, yeah! Did you see that? I'm gonna give you a couple days to think on it, Jimmy. You have yourself a nice evening, now. Okay. My turn? - Wow. - Everything all right? - Ah, yes. Yeah. - You know, it was work stuff. He said he might have something for me down the line. Something different. Anything good? Um, well, I don't know yet. Mm. Mm-mm-mm. Don't worry about it, okay? All right. I get it. Change the subject, Annie. So then, why don't you tell me about your big wedding plans? Oh, yeah. See, that I got all figured out. Oh, really? Yes, ma'am. Yeah. Yeah, we gonna do it somewhere special. You know, like right out of a postcard. Have lights hanging up all over the place. Rose petals just flying around. A band playing. And we're gonna do it somewhere near the beach. So when you come walking down the aisle, you feel that ocean breeze hit you. And then at the end, well, you know, after we say "I do", and I kiss my new bride, we're gonna light up the sky with a Blaze of fireworks. So everyone around knows that Annie and Jimmy ray finally made things right. How's that sound? It doesn't sound anything like us. Now, come on. I thought you always wanted a big wedding. Twelve-year-old Annie would have loved it. Okay, what about Annie now? She likes to keep things simple. Hey there, Jimmy? Did you have time to think about my offer? Yes, sir. I'm afraid the answer's no. Now you know. Well, I mean, as long as I'm here. You wouldn't mind me havin' a little look-see around your locker now, would you? - I ain't got nothing to hide. - Go on. Uh-uh. We got ourselves a wallet. Mouthwash. Couple jackets. Couple shirts, white shorts. Not-so-white shorts. Jasmine blossom deodorant. Let me guess, a gift from the missus. Somethin' like that. Well, all in all, locker looks legit. All right now. - Oh, hold on now. - Oh, no. What's this I see? Oh, so we're gonna play a game now? No games, Jimmy. What I see here is two grams of pure parole violation. Now, do you really want to break Annie's heart like that? Don't fucking say her name. Temper, temper, Jimmy. Temper, temper. Now, I'm gonna remind you of that eye in the sky. Look to your left. There you go. Take your hands off me nice and easy-like. Nice and easy. There you go. There you go, cowboy. So what's the job? I knew you'd come to your senses. Yeah. Well, what is it? You see, Jimmy, my unique position allows me to facilitate several highly profitable transactions. But I can't be fraternizing with the riffraff that comes along with it. Now, I'm. I'm more like a queen bee, I guess you could say. And I got this enormous hive of worker bees. And each one has their own specific task. Some do the picking, some do the sending, and together they make this beautiful honeycomb. A money comb. Cute. Now, in that note, you can find an address. All you got to do is arrive and collect. Any trouble I need to know about? No. Well, no. Ain't no man likes to be separated from his cash. But all in all, they a'right folks. They know how shit plays out. Looks like you, uh, you know, made up your mind, so I'm just gonna leave you be. All right, Jimmy. And who the fuck are you? I'm the errand boy. Hey, Carlos. Wasn't I clear asking schmidt to come here in person? Yeah, you were, boss. So why are you here? I'm just following orders. So you're schmidt's new errand boy. His new money donkey, huh? I see you noticed our new rug. Ugly, isn't it? We bought it especially for sefior schmidt. I don't want any trouble, okay? That's between you and him. Let me tell you something. This schmidt guy is like, um. Like a cat. UN gato. He's got nine lives or something. Tonight was supposed to be his night and now you got that shit all messed up. I say we waste him. What good would that do? Send a message. At least let me take his hand off. Tempting. You let go of my brother. All right, listen. I didn't come here to kill anybody, but I sure as hell didn't come here to die. If you want to kill that son of a bitch schmidt, go ahead. Be my guest. You all'd be doing me a favor. But we both know if I don't bring him back his cut, he's gonna send us all back to jail. Don't listen to this pendejo. He's just trying to save his ass. , shut up. This thing is getting heavy, man. Whoa, whoa. Calm down. Jefe. Now you listen good. You go back to him, you give him the money. But this here. This never happened. Say it. It never happened. Good. And regarding the inevitable fate of Mr. Schmidt. Let's just say he lives to die another day. Yeah, I can live with that. I on the trail of time I I there's many sorrows I I and a worried mind I I can't be at rest I I oh everything I I I ever wanted I I I do not find I I though I done my best I oh, shit. I I can see those stars I Whoa! Frank! Frank! Whoa! What the fuck happened? Got in an accident. An accident? That's what you call an accident? That's a fucking horror show. That's a goddamn Houdini act is what that is. Now let's see, why would you bring it to me? - I need it to go away. - You need it to go away, right. You forgot to mention there's a fuckin' body here. Can you help me? Jesus Christ, you got any idea what you're askin' me to do here? When you cross a line like this, you don't come back from that. I told you it was an accident. There's nothin' I could do. He came out of nowhere! It's a clusterfuck is what it is. Doesn't matter if it was an accident, does it? Look, I'm gonna do this if you help me or not. There's no need to be rude about it. Tryin' to make sure you're up for it. That's all. I am. Well, all right, then. Start with the meat. You get the bottom and I'll get the top. Fuck, man. Now could you at least close his eyes? Here. I don't think you're gonna have a problem. Truck's fixed. And, uh. Once I empty that shredder, it's a needle in a fuckin' haystack, so. I know. I owe you, frank. Man, I told you before you don't owe me shit. Now get the fuck out of here. Not wise to be consortin' with known criminals. Jimmy? Hey. Why do you feel the need to sneak in? No, I just didn't know if you were asleep or not and I don't wanna wake you, that's all. Where'd you get the shirt? It was. I mean, it's not mine. Worth let me borrow it 'cause I got stuff on mine. Warts and all. Remember, Jimmy. You can tell me anything. Ain't nothin' to tell, hon. I can't go through this again, Jimmy. You comin' home late, never saying where you're goin', when you're comin' back. You're right. Right, I can't treat you like this again. I'm sorry. Jimmy! That's not what I meant. Rise and shine, baby. Everything all right, buddy? Yeah, I'll be up. Trouble with the lady? See you inside, Romeo. Is he all right? Come on, boy. Teachers and students protested today in Texas, demanding higher wages and additional resources for their students. The teachers are demanding a $10,000 raise Close to $200 million in education funding. It is the latest in a series of teacher walkouts. So far, teachers in four states, each with a republican governor and legislature, have walked out of their classrooms, marching for school funding. Honest frank? I'd like to have a word with you if that's all right. Well? You just gonna leave me hanging? That's not very courteous of you. Ah. No, no, no. Make yourselves at home. My name is whit price. Ever heard of me? By the look on your face, I'd wager you have. Good. See, I believe familiarity is the key to all good dealings. Everybody knows who's who. There's no surprises. Makes things, um, smoother. Wouldn't you agree, honest frank? Just call me frank. First-name basis. Even better. Now, let's cut to the chase. Tell us where it is. And we can be on our way. Tell you where what is? Today is a very busy day for me. I thought we were on the same page. I'm just not sure what you mean, that's all. Oh, I know you know exactly what I mean. See, you have both your TV and your radio tuned to the local news. Lottery's still two days away. So I'm guessing you're waiting on somethin' else. Missing persons report, perhaps? What? Man, I don't know what you're talkin' about. I-I really don't. Maybe I'm at fault here. You know, iwalk in here, talkin' about familiarity. I'm leaving you all in the dark. So, in the spirit of familiarity, I'm going to share my current predicament with you. As you may have some new light to shed on the subject. I don't know why you think I have light to shed here. Come on, man. I don't know... That could not have been pleasant. Well, I'll go ahead and explain. I'm a businessman. I'm involved in several... Ventures. And some of those ventures include the transportation of very precious commodities. Now last night, one of my couriers failed to deliver one of those said commodities... Something or someone stopped him on his way. Now, I admit, I may have been a bit hasty in the. Executing of the job. The selection of personnel was, uh. Less than optimal. But I was pressed for time. So, I do take some of the blame. But then, there's this. You know what this is? It's a tracker. It's a wonderful device. You slap this teeny, little tracer on every vehicle and voila, no more g ligsswo rk. Had I not known better, I would have just assumed this was just an unfortunate accident. We might have been combing the roadside for a month. But this little device shows me that my cargo had made its way right down to this rusty little patch. Mr. Price, nothing like that came through here. Call me whit. Now, a quick rundown through some of the uses this yard lends itself to. I can only assume that my transport of commodity was intercepted with the specific intent to eliminate any evidence. You see. The last time a signal was sent, just before it died, was right outside your doorstep. Please, I don't know anything about that. I swear to god. Now, let's do this one last time, shall we? I seem to have misplaced 500 grand, last traced to this very place. Now, if you have a better solution to this puzzle, I'm all ears. What the fuck are you talkin' about, 500 grand? Ring a bell? Ah, that son of a bitch. Pardon? He told me that it was just an accident, all right? I don't know anything about fucking 500 grand. All right? I never did it, I just helped him clean it up. That's it. Well, perhaps this son of a bitch can help us resolve this conundrum? Name and address, and please don't make me repeat myself. No, no, no, no! Don't you fucking do it! No, no, no! No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! Ah, fuck. You motherfucker! Let me get this straight. This greedy cohort of yours is out there havin' 500 grand worth of a good time while throwing you under the bus, and you're still willing to die for him? Now that is friendship. No, no, no, no! - Good day, ma'am. - Hi. Sorry to disturb you. No trouble. I just got me a little business I need to discuss with Jimmy. Right. Well, Jimmy's not home, he's at work. - Oh, hardworking man. - That's nice. Yeah. If you wouldn't mind? As state correctional officers, uh, we're mandated to perform the occasional random search of a parolee's current residence. I see. Come on in. You've made a lovely home for yourself here, Annie. Thank you very much. I gotta tell you, your man, he's made quite the progress these last couple of days. He's a good man. Yeah. That's what he tells me. Yeah. He definitely has the right incentive to come home to. Oh, come on. Don't be shy. You and me, we both know it takes a certain kind of woman to put up with a life like this. It tells me a lot about you. It shows your character. That's love, Mr. Schmidt. Ah. That's... love, it goes a long way. In fact. I'd venture to say there ain't about nothin' that you wouldn't do for him. Am I right or am I right? Well, I can think of a couple things I wouldn't do. Uh-huh. What is that intoxicating smell? It's chocolate cake. Birthday? One week out. That's sweet. You think I might get me a little slice of that chocolate heaven? Well, you know. The groom's supposed to be the one to take the first bite. - Mm-hm. - Otherwise, it's bad luck. Yeah. I know. But you know what, I'll take my chances. Don't hold back. I got me a sweet tooth. Mm. That's just the way I like it. You know, Jimmy, he's a very, very lucky man. We both are. Speak of the devil. I thought you said Jimmy's not here? This is not Jimmy. It's schmidt, Mr. Price. I'm a state correctional officer. Ma'am, has Jimmy had any dealings with this man? - I don't know. - May I? - Please. - No, you may not. This is a known career criminal. Are you aware that any association with a suspected or convicted criminal constitutes a parole violation? It's, um. Schmidt, right? Yes, it is. And believe this is going in my report. You best be on your way now. Are you threatening a state employee? Just trying to avoid the inevitable. Oh, I tell you what's inevitable, is me calling the... You just couldn't leave, huh? Annie? Annie? Hey. Annie? Annie? She can't get to the phone right now. Who is this? My name is whit price. Ever heard of me? I can't really see you nodding. But I'll take that silence for a resounding yes. Now, for the issue at hand. I was recently informed by an associate of yours, honest frank, that you are in possession of a large sum of money which was on its way to me last night. Well, I have no idea what you're talkin' about. My courier was carrying a half a million dollars, and he never made it home. Instead, I found pieces of his meticulously chopped bike at the recently deceased honest frank's scrapyard. I can only guess that my courier faced a similar horrible fate. - Okay. - Listen, mister. Mr. Price, last night was an accident. He came out of nowhere. There was nothin' I could do, okay? Now look here. I'm willing to overlook the sad loss of a human life. But if you ever want to share another dance with your lovely woman here, you better come up with my 500 grand. You gotta believe me. I never laid eyes on that money, okay? It could be anywhere by now. Well then, you have 24 hours to turn that anywhere into somewhere. Oh, just one more thing. Don't forget to take out the trash. Hey! Who the fuck are you? I'm Jimmy. And where's Vinnie? He took the day off. What do you mean, he took the day off? Is this some amateur hour or somethin'? I'm calling my father. That's a good idea, Tommy. You should go ahead and do that. - Yo, what's up, dad? - Tommy? Hey, I'm in a car, and this smartass is saying Vinnie took the day off. What's his name? He says his name is... Hey, what's your name again? Jimmy. Jimmy ray. Jimmy ray. Can you get out? He locked the doors. Where's he taking you? How the fuck should I know where he's taking me? Let me talk to him. Here, he wants to talk to you. Mr. Price. Are you out of your goddamn mind? What the hell are you doing? I'm doing just fine, Mr. Price, but seeing as you have my woman and I really don't have your money, well, you didn't give me much of a choice now, did you? So you kidnapped my son? Yeah, I figured he was worth more than 500 grand to you. Listen, if you hurt my son... Ain't nobody's gonna hurt anybody, Mr. Price. This is a fair exchange right here. Your boy for my Annie. You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. - No, Mr. Price. - You're the one that has no idea. You have pushed a desperate man a little too far here. You back a man like that into a corner, you ain't give him no choice but to break down the fucking walls. But still, I believe there is a peaceful solution to all of this, okay? Hey, I'm all about peace. All right, good. And I want you to meet me tonight at mack's bbq. 8 pm. 8 P.M.? That's a houseful of obese motherfuckers to deal with. - Yeah, well. - You know what they call a house full of obese motherfuckers where I'm from? - Enlighten me. - Life insurance. Yo, my iPhone. You motherfucker! You know how many apps I had on that thing? Man, turn the car around. - No. - Turn the car around. Mm-mm. Hey! Hey, knock it off. You keep doing that, we're gonna have a problem. What you gonna do about it? What are you doing? Let me out. Let me out! Please, let me out. Come on. Let me out, man. Please let me out, man. Let's make a deal. Please! Come on, man. Help. Help! Aah! What the hell is wrong with your husband? He just kidnapped my son. My son! I was afraid he would do something like that. This is business, pure and simple. He had no right to drag my family into this. In all fairness, you did drag his family first. All he had to do was bring the money. Well, I guess he wanted to use the same currency that you do. You find this funny? You have nothing to worry about, all right. Jimmy would never hurt a kid. You better pray nothing happens to my son. Well, you better pray nothing happens to his fiancee. Hey, you almost killed me in there. Yeah, well, you're not done yet, so. Come on. Out you go. Get your hands off me. For a moment, just walk, okay? You're gettin' in that truck. - Uh-uh. - Yes, sir. Man, you're crazy. - This is what we have to do. - Come on, man. No, this is how it goes. Come on. In you go. Hey, remember, small breaths, all right? - I'll show you small... - All right. Can I offer you something to drink? Just my medicine. It's in my apron. Trace the car. Huh. Now I know why you're so calm. Doctor's orders. Cancer? Lung cancer, to be precise, Mr. Price. And your doctor gave you weed? My doctor gave me nine to 12 months. I'm so sorry. What's so funny? Well, I mean, you got to be able to appreciate the irony, right? I'm being consoled by my kidnapper. That's how I lost my wife. I'm sorry. Do you mind? By all means. My wife, she loved to smoke. I told her it'd kill her one day. She didn't listen. And you? Were you a smoker? Me? No. I was a good girl. I never smoked a day in my life. My only crime was working at a shabby hair salon. I don't follow. Well, this might come as a surprise to you, Mr. Price. It sure came as a surprise to me. But, um, smoking is not the only way that you get lung cancer. Apparently, inhaling commercial quantities of hair product fumes will also do the trick. Hair product fumes? - Yeah. - Really? Yeah. Women will do anything to get rid of their curls, and I was there to help them all... A dozen a day in my small and poorly-ventilated corner of the salon. Wish they'd just leave their curls alone, you know? Keep it natural. I like curls. My wife had curls. Hm. Me too. But we're a dying breed. I mean, literally, a dying breed. I hope that road wasn't too bumpy back there. When this is over, I'm gonna tell my father to do you in myself. Yeah. All right, then. Come on. Let's go. Okay. We're going in that trailer right there. All right, let's go. I ain't going in there. - Kid, don't try my Patience. - Come on. Look, I've seen movies. The minute we walk in, you're gonna try to pull down your pants. What the hell are you talking about? You know what they do to old pervs like you in prison? - Cut off your balls. - Okay. Jesus Christ, kid, what is wrong with you? Look, I'm not gonna touch you, okay? But if you don't get your ass inside here, I'm gonna start cutting off your fingers and mailing 'em to your dad. You hear? Fine. But you better not try anything funny. Real classy. I appreciate it. So how much money did you ask for me? Million? Two million? Well, I didn't ask for any money. No money? What kind of business is you running here? Your father has my woman. Man, all this over a girl? Yes, sir. Fuck you. You're bluffing. No woman's worth this kind of risk. Not even your mom? Hey, my mom was a Saint. That's why god took her so soon. I'm sorry to hear that. Now, if you don't mind me changing the subject, I didn't eat all day. What's for lunch? I got a couple of Turkey sandwiches over there. Well, they're not gonna come over here on their own. Okay. Wait. There's no special sauce inside? Somethin' that's gonna make me fall asleep? Man, just eat it. All right. What do you think? Not bad. Good. Man, quit playing with your food. Hey, I just wanted to see what's inside. - Well, I can... - I can tell you that. You got Turkey, you know, a little lettuce, a little Mayo, and my own secret ingredient. What's that? Just a hint of peanut butter. Not bad, huh? Hey, man. Peanuts! You moron! You know, I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I ain't buying it, kid. I can't breathe. Epipen! I need my epipen! Oh, shit. I need my epipen! Where is it? Backpack. Back... 0h, shit. Shit. Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop! Kid, look out! Shit. You gotta be kidding me. Hey. Hey, kid. Kid, come on, talk to me. Kid. Don't touch me, perv. Oh, thank god. Okay. Where's it hurt? Fucking everywhere, you idiot. I just got hit by a car. - Okay. Okay. - Look at me, all right? Can you follow my finger? Huh? Hey. Can you follow mine? I'm fine. Okay. All right, come on. You can run. I'll give you that. I would've made it if it wasn't for that car. Yeah, you would've. Your Jimmy. Is he a good guy? He'd better be. I've been waitin' for 12 years to marry him. Twelve years? It's a long story. We've got time. Well, have you ever taken a blood oath? I-I can't say that I have. Jimmy and I took one. When we were seven. That's beautiful. Yeah, you would think. Except it was a bloody mess. I saw it in an old movie, and I just begged Jimmy to do it with me. He was so terrified by the sight of blood that I had to administrate the whole thing. I was so enthusiastic that the knife went right through his hand, like butter. Just blood, rivers of blood. And then the blade was so rusty that Jimmy ended up in the hospital for a week. It was a mess. Well, did you ever end up finishing the blood oath? We sure did. So. What went wrong? Nothing. I mean, Jimmy's a criminal and you're... Jimmy's no criminal. He's not. He's not. The job he went in for is the onlyjob he ever tried to pull, and he only did it to try to gain the respect of my no-good father. Your father? The only true criminal in my life. Had my... my brother killed, my fiance in jail. At least he got what he deserved. And you didn't know anything about this? Well, I mean, I knew my dad was up to no good. I just never thought he'd drag Jimmy into it. Jimmy probably thought he was doing it for you. Yeah. I guess he did. Well. You do the crime. You do the time. We both did. Alright, here's some. Don't touch me. I thought I lost you there for a sec. Spare me. You thought you lost your meal ticket. Are you sure you're okay? It's gonna take more than a fuckin' car to bring me down. You're the real deal, Tommy. Don't you forget that. Dad? Are you all right, son? Do I look all right? Tommy, I want you to go wait in the car. I want to have a word or two with this man, okay? You're not letting him go, right? Tommy, what did I say? Joey, make sure he stays in the car. Come on. Don't get wet. Tommy, is that the car that brought you here? No. It's that one right there. Wait, why? Are you going to blow it up or something? You know how your father feels about those questions, right? I know. - All right, listen. - Wait for me here. I'm going with you, Joe. Don't tell your father. - All right. - Come on. Hold this. Just for a sec. - Are you okay? - Mm-hm. Are you okay? Yeah. Okay. A heck of a kid you got there, Mr. Price. And that's a heck of a woman you got there, Jimmy. Okay, what now? Normally, I would hunt you down for the rest of your lives. But, me and Annie have had a long conversation about your special situation, and it's made me a little sentimental. So here's what we're going to do. I'm going to allow you to spend these last few months with Annie. Sorry, Annie. It's all right. I'm going to let you marry Annie. Finally give her the life that you took from her. But. The moment this lovely creature leaves this earth and ascends to the gates of heaven, you come back to me and stand account for damage done. I can live with that. Good. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to tend to my son. Thank you, Mr. Price. You're welcome, ma'am. And might I suggest you hold on to her as long as you can. Annie, look... - It's all right, Jimmy. - We don't have to talk about it. This ain't what I planned for us. I know. Hey, ain't you mad at me? Oh, I'm furious with you, Jimmy ray. But what good would that do to me? Doctor said in my condition, I should be chasing rainbows. Can you catch me a rainbow, Jimmy ray? I know that smile. What do you have up your sleeve? Ah. Well, you know, I... I heard they got these, they got these giant rainbow down in Mexico. Mexico? Yeah. I'm not packed. But I packed for you. - For both of us. - Did you now? - Yes, ma'am. - Mm-hm. And passports? You forgettin' that you're on parole? We can't exactly just stroll out of the country. What passport? All a man and a woman need to get to Mexico is right there. Where did you get this? Poor ol' schmidt. Poor ol' schmidt. So, come on, what do you say? You want to run away with me? What, like a couple of fugitives? Annie, honey. We are fugitives. Did you, uh, get the car insurance? Premium package. You know I understand everything you guys are saying, right? And you guys still talk in codes. Tommy. Look. I just don't get why you're letting him go. Did he even tell you about the car accident? What car accident? He didn't tell you how I managed to ditch his ass? Did you now? I outran the son of a bitch but got hit by a car. Sure you did. You don't believe me. I believe you, Tommy. I believe you. Let's go home. I appreciate you. Good morning, sleepyhead. Hm. Good mornin'. Jimmy ray, where have you taken me? I know it ain't a castle or anything, but... It's perfect. Yeah? Yeah. Good. What do we say we get you inside? I'll grab our stuff and you can start getting ready. Getting ready? What am I getting ready for? - Come on. - Did you not get the invite? We're getting married. I mean, unless you're getting cold - feet on me now. - Oh, of course not, but don't we need like a priest and witnesses? Yeah, but that's details, okay? Don't worry about all of that. - I got it all figured out, huh? - Okay. - Okay. - Yeah, trust me. And where's the young prince this morning? Probably still sulking in his room. His breakfast is getting cold. And you know how I hate wasting food. Okay. Okay. I'm going in there. My god, it stinks in here. I know you hear me, boy. And I know you're still mad at me. And you probably have every right to be. Come on, kid. I promise I'll make it up to you. Remember that trip to Europe we were talking about? Tommy? Tommy? Help! Help! Help! Mr. Price? How is he, doctor? Well, it's still too early to tell. Your son is suffering from internal bleeding caused by severe trauma to the head. Now, it could be any number of reasons. But we discovered some bruises and small fractures consistent with, uh... Was your son involved in a car accident? Maybe riding his bike? Mr. Price? You just make him better. Mr. Price, where are you going? Mr. Price. I need you to run that car insurance for me. Do we know where they are? Yeah. Tracker's got them in Mexico. I don't care what it takes. I want you to find that bastard and his wife. Then I want you to kill her in front of his eyes. Make it fast and painless. Euthanasia. I don't follow. - I don't want her to suffer. - Just him. Got it. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today in the presence of these witnesses to join James and Annie in marriage to be honorable among all. James, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? To love her, comfort her, honor her, and keep her in sickness and in health until death do you part? I do. You may now give her the ring. And do you, Annie, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? To love him, honor him, and keep him in sickness and in health until death do you part? I do. You can give him the ring now. By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride. Are you happy, Annie? I'm happy, Jimmy. Good. - Sorry, sefior. - Oh. Whoo! I did promise you fireworks, huh? Thank you. Yes, you did. Go ahead. Do your thing. Two hundred fifteen pesos. This is all I got. Let me get your change. Appreciate it. Shit! Shit! Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Hi, love. Hey, there are two men headed to the front of the house. You gotta grab the gun out of the dresser, make sure it's loaded, then run out the back door. Do it now. Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Fast and painless. How did they find us? Price sure loves his bugs. Son of a bitch couldn't let it go. - All right, so we run, right? - We just run again. No! Annie, no. Okay? I know this type. I've seen them in prison. He's gonna keep coming after us. I'll be damned if we're gonna spend our last year together runnin' around, looking over our shoulders the whole time. This ends now. There's nothing I can do to change your mind? My mind ain't the problem here. - Just come back to me. - All right, Jimmy? Cross my heart. Come back. Hey, kiddo. I really need you to wake up now. I'm s o r r y, t o m m v I'm sorry I didn't believe you when you told me about the accident. How could I? You've always. Told these stories. Remember when you told me about... the blonde... Beautiful algebra teacher? What was her name? Oh, Meg? No, no, Maggie. It was like two years after your mother's funeral. You told me she... She came to you and she asked about me. She wanted to know if I was seeing anybody, and she wouldn't mind if I asked her out on a date. Remember what happened next? Everybody does. How could I have known that you would tell the truth this time around? It's quite the tale, don't you think? Come back to me, Tommy. Please. I already lost your mother. Don't leave me here alone. {gunshofl - {gunshofl - {Gunshofl I'm so sorry, Jimmy. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Oh, Jimmy ray, I'm never letting you out of my sight again. J' I won't care I won't cry I I if you're there I'll get by I I if the rivers I I should all run dry I I and every star I I tumble down from the sky I I I won't care I won't cry I I if you're there I'll get by I I I won't care as long as I have you I I and if my dreams never do come true I I and every plan that I've made falls through I I I won't care I won't cry I I if you're there I'll get by I I I won't care as long as I have you I I if the sky should I I shudder and fall I I and tumble down to the sea I I oh let it fall I I it won't matter at all I I if you still if you still believe in me I I so let the oceans I I all turn to sand I I just as love as my love will stand I I I won't care I won't cry I I if you're there I'll get by I I I won't care as long as I have you I ias long as I have you I ias long as I have you I
