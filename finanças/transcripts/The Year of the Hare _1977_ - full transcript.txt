There was nothing else in the fridge Vaulonen called from Kouvola and threatened to quit the whole project Well, the text was good, don't you agree The text is not the issue. Come here Tell him to call again in ten minutes Now you'll go with Miettinen to Kouvola and clear up the case From there on you can drive to Laatunen in Jyv?skyl? early tomorrow morning Now don't get angry, but you're starting to fall off a bit That's how it is We're old friends and I don't have to beat around the bush The old folk are driving by, man! Can't you, or - don't you want to, for fucks sake, take action according to industry's terms When we were preparing our career, the real competition hadn't even started You can't use the new technique You better close in on the lead if you're going to hang on It's a hard game Well you're going fast You know, these horsepower are so expensive, that there's no use wasting them It's two thousand, straight out of the salary In five years I'll have everything paid, house included Good for you Then I'll switch the house for a bigger one And I'm not going to keep the car for another year either The gas propellant in these destroy the atmosphere's ozone layer It's hazardous for the whole creation Bullshit We should get straight to the point Economist Bergstr?m and account Lankinen are in a hurry For starters I'd like to point out - that a lot of effort has been put into the development of this deodorant The campaign is not allowed to fail It's a good idea to emphasize this There should probably be more content. Lankinen, take a look at this Do you want to hand out the budget proposition? The meaning is to sell this to citizens Yes, the nature's here too But it's like far from the idea The emphasis is on freshness Romantic, too romantic, Vatanen Those containers would look quite dull on a shelf next to each other We won't make it to Jyv?skyl? before midnight We can stay overnight in Heinola. You can enjoy your evening beer in peace I won't be staying in Heinola I've got this great chick in Jyv?skyl? Fuck! A leveret went under Damn animal Good thing it didn't hit the windshield Can you see it? Get back here already! We'll never make it to Jyv?skyl? - or even to Heinola if you keep running in some woods here Stay there if you want then! I'm going to Heinola! Good bye then! I lost a friend into the woods The woods... Yes, a lot of men have vanished in the forests of Finland Where's the gentleman headed? We'll drive there towards Nastola... Along the forest road I'll tell you later when to stop But there's no settlement here? That's the bad thing Vatanen! Come back here! Vatanen! Shall I wait? Vatanen! Vatanen! Fuck! Hello! Ye-es It doesn't seem like he's here in Jyv?skyl? Oh, really? In the forest? He just went into the woods and never came back I yelled for him, but he didn't answer Are you a criminal? - Why? Are you scared? No. I was just thinking, when you came out of the woods - that you could be an escaped convict Hey, you have a rabbit! That's not a rabbit. It's a hare. I found it Poor little thing. I'll fetch some carrots for it They don't seem to appeal. - It's a bit sick Hey, it has hurt its foot. Poor little thing Is there a veterinarian in this town? - Yes, his reception - is behind that point, in the municipality building It's in a mild shock It has to rest for a while, but it will get better What can it be fed with? Grass, salad, - water of course, and milk, when it's this small Vatanen here, hello. I could sell that boat to you now Well, back then I didn't sell, but now I do Let's say 11000. Yes Send the money as urgent referral to Heinola And later, a fresh salad for this creature Oh, animals can't be on the table It's not dangerous You're welcome. - Thanks Well, eat salad now too. Like this It's Vatanen here, hello. I'm in the society building What came over you? The article was good Well, we won't keep a grudge between old friends If you happen to say something once in a while... Well that's more like it. Got you there, bastard If you have some woman there, get rid of her We have your wife with us 10500, 11000... Well? What do you eat? Right... A male Yes, barely a month old What might a chap like that eat? It surely drinks milk, but salad doesn't seem to be adequate No, but try with young clover And besides clover, grass might do. And regrown grain The nature reserve law states it's forbidden to have wild animals as pets This hare has to be officially declared I'll write you a permission Certification I hereby certify, that the one in possession of the certificate, Vatanen, - has the right to keep and feed a wild field hare, - because it has an injured back leg - and might have died Mikkeli, today U. K?rkk?inen The wilderness care district in Southern Savonia And it likes meadow vetchling and all sorts of vetch Meadow vetchling? What sort of plant is that? Meadow vetchling looks pretty much like vetch I'll show you, so that you're sure to recognize it Hey! Don't fetch any from the verge of the road, it may contain led! Come here! I've always been interested in plants If only I could have afforded to go to school, then... I would have started studying these Lathyrus pratensis The leaves, in pairs and kinda lance-like What might an animal like that be thinking of? Probably more than we could ever imagine Yes, I'm from the countryside Here you learn, that if it's hard - or one would like to get something of your chest - I would speak to the dog or the horse - when I couldn't stand the humans Often you got a feeling - that an animal can understand feelings better and won't run along and gossip behind your back Vatanen! Hey! -Laaksonen, hey Are you on a vacation? - Just going through You have to come visit us. Today I'm going to Iisalmi, - but we'll see tomorrow Tomorrow morning, at lunch time Vatanen? For a tenner! Lottery tickets! An east finnish car is the first price - then there's a stereo and a travel radio and dolls... Everything from a car to soap What's in your basket? I don't believe it Is it a hare or? Wouldn't you sell it? - No, I'm not selling it If you're not selling, I'll give you hundred tickets, we'll switch I'm not selling my buddy Then buy one ticket at least Well, if one for the hare Now we'll go to the woods for a few days - and learn some hunter skills You can't imagine how the nerves are at rest there All my life I've been working my ass off Running from there to here, morning to night, sweating You can't believe what it was like But now it's over We'll push through some bushes now, don't be scared You're still with me Then from here directly to to the mountain crest - then it's over. Everything is right Just the two of us - without women nagging and shouting At least we have enough provisions with us A sack of hay for you - and a damn heavy back pack for me Oh, lots of blueberry growth Two journeymen once upon a time In the country side into the woods they went They were dressed like gentlemen And with a cigar in the mouth Don't tremble, motherland, though your son sways Here and there uneven That you would win these stereos... That's what happens when animals buy lottery tickets I should have sold these in Kuopio already - but you don't that quickly do business with the Savonian people - and I'm too much of a Savonian to give anything for free too What do you think of my Savonian dialect by the way? Are you listening? Ears just wagging Hey! Hare! Hey, look at this We won't do anything with it We'll put it there You're a silent buddy Quite different from home So, here between us - my wife is a horrible hag It's like too nice of a car: First you have to get it and then you don't need it I guess she would have switched me for someone else as well- if the house wasn't still unpaid Though she probably first assumed that I was different - when I myself was trying to be different Do you understand? Classy Vatanen, trend maker Vatanen, - confident, active, highly streamlined Vatanen And here we are now. Finally Come here beside me Good day Wouldn't you like to buy stereos? - No I could sell. They're only getting wet. - I don't want to I see. Who are you? - Vatanen I see, Vatanen? And selling stereos Yes, these are the hare's It won it in the lottery. - The hare's? I have a hare. - Yea right. 10400 mark Where have you gotten all this cash from? I've sold my boat in Helsinki Show the receipt If it's not in the pile, I don't have it There's nothing here I have never afforded - to carry this much money in my wallet. - Me neither Is that so, an advertising man We've got reports, that you've been trying to sell stereos - and are talking to yourself Where did you get the stereos? I won them in a lottery at the fair in Kuopio, like I said Or rather, the hare won What should one do here? They called from Kuopio - and said that this hare man seems to have won these stereos In our case they would have locked him in over night - seeing as he's a drifter and has this much money Well, what's the deal then. Into the clink already! Where do we put the hare? God damn. That thing can't be put into the clink It's not even a human But if we confiscate the hare and let it out into the woods Take a closer look at my papers This hare is my property Proof that Vatanen has the right to keep - and feed a wild, aha, hare Suddenly this got very complicated I think he could leave - and come back tomorrow for questioning at ten o'clock Take it easy now. What do we know about this man? Take a look at the money. Is this guy even Vatanen at all? Might have forged papers Yes, bloody hell, don't go just yet Have to think about this Does Vatanen want any? - Thanks We don't have anything against you, but the police too has to follow the law How could we know if in Helsinki, you haven't done - a murder robbery, when you've got this much money? And then you've gone crazy - and walked around Finland with a hare You could be one of those unpredictable people Don't babble, there's been no murder here If we do it like this - that you'd nevertheless stay here - when not even your clothes are dry You don't have to be locked in the clink, just stay here We'll make some coffee and wait for the county sheriff Yes, I don't mind staying here Would you sell me the stereos? I'll trade them for those boots Alright Hey! I'm county sheriff Savolainen It's a clear cut case, - the papers seems to be in order I told you he didn't need to be jailed I'm going night fishing on the lake We put out the nets in the evening Wouldn't you come and sleep over in the fishing sauna? Night shelter is just what I need I've got a fishing buddy Hannikainen here Retired because of heart problems Former county sheriff in Kiuruvesi I'm leaving for work in the morning You can stay here if you like Yes, why not Even if Kekkonen himself came here, you could offer this From here you can see your fatherland, and the whole world - in one glance In these cares Kekkonen too found his line Water is clear In the Finnish bay they fish for eyeless herring It's horrible, just the thought of it Imagine, Hannikainen Anybody could live like this If one could only understand Like this... Like this exactly This should do as warming for Kekkonen himself He said once in an interview, that he only takes for joy, - never for grief. - A good guy He's the best. - If only the would find a successor He already exists... The successor Found already? Serving already Listen here, Vatanen You got to promise, that you keep this to yourself - what I'm about to tell you It'll never leave my mouth Look now I'VE DONE MY BEST NEW OUTLOOK Do you see the difference? They look the same? Here's Kekkonen's head from the year 1945 Here from the year 1972 Do you see now, that the pictures are different Under here, a head shot from 1945 and above here... From 1964. Completely identical! But here's a head shot from 1969 Completely different. The difference is radical Seems like it, yea But what does that prove? I'm saying this straight out: - in these head shots, is not at all the same person The alteration has occurred some time around 1968 This old Kekkonen either died or was murdered - or stood down voluntarily from his leading position, - and the new Kekkonen replaced him An almost identical man - even by voice But I've revealed the switch Do you see, Vatanen, you can't change the shape of the head Here I've got Kekkonen's height growth diagram Over the year 1968 a significant change On the time of Paasikivi's burial - Kekkonen was 179cm tall But after 68, 181cm Surprising growth in the old days, right? This new Kekkonen is also more quick-witted than the old one Here I've got a list of his vocabulary I DON'T HAVE TO BECOME YOUNGER "Citizens, we live in the history of humanity" - "in a big time of unrest and upheaval", - "when everywhere it is explored, what exactly is happening in the world" - "and what should be done to resolve the problems" "The ever so rapid, simply revolutionary development" - "has brought forth certain questions" - "that last of all is about man" - "and its society." After the year 1968 Kekkonen had - a more youthful way of thinking than before His standpoint became more friendly to progress - and his consistency became much better He sort of became more boyish - and his sense of humour became much better Not surprising when the actual person itself has been switched But it's not like they can endlessly switch out the old Kekkonen to a younger one! Consider this: 90 years, 100 years, and the guy just gets better If only you make 20-30 years go by... Vatanen! Vatanen hey! Vatanen, hey! There's a big forest fire in Vehmasj?rvi! I'm flying around like a messenger all around the towns, we leave shortly Should I come too? You stay here and take care of the hare, there's no need for you to come Take this instead Come now, Vatanen Stay calm, I'll send the hare after you There, just by the right edge! Use the third nozzle, not the fourth! Good, keep it in check there! Turn over the spray! Don't leave, it'll start burning soon More! Just a bit more! Hush, hush! Hush, hush! Just let it be! Hey ho! Hey, wake up! I'm Salosensaari, who are you? - Vatanen My factory burned down That was it for everything, there's nothing left How much can a man bear How much can a man weigh What the hell are we going to do? Back to the brook You take some too You, Salosensaari, you're a good moonshiner Without an excuse, you don't boast to the man Even the village chief praised. We sat one on one Sure it was the village chief? - Well, some police anyway Isn't it good? Yes, very good Look at satan, so it comes Two fierce against each other, when man and nature strike together Emperor Nero is watching Rome burning together with Brutus This is almost like nature It didn't spread here though Well, it was a close call It was bad, when this... A big damage occurred, and how's the work place? Surely it's closed for 3 days... - Yes It was that kind of job, where you were dying of thirst Is it coming on? What an outrageous man! Driving like that Straight into people And from a common pot! Is there anyone here that has a hare as a pet? Here we are then, together again I should get the name and social security number, - so we could send the fee Miikkulainen, Kaarlo, from Punkalaidun Yes, now it's loose It didn't hurt now did it? And then you'll come back in two weeks and present it By all means. Now try jumping on that foot - so I can see if it holds up Just go ahead Doesn't look too good Shut up! What is it now? God damn. What if there's someone in our cottage? Look at that shit, living there like it's his own! Should we call someone? We don't need the officials to do this, let's go and kick ass God day, I spent the night there - and thought I'd chop some woods as a thank you Hare, hey He's got a hare, let's make some roast of it Hey, I need a shot Grab hold! There is our hero Let the hare go, so we don't have to shoot it in your arms It's not hunting season now Don't come here with your paragraphs, we've fought with those - all winter and now we're on vacation Give me the gun. - This is going to be difficult You can tell how Karlsson shot a hare in the tree - and a thief too with the same shot I'm not a thief Thief or bum, if the hare doesn't come down, you both go down Shoot, shoot, for fucks sake! We'll leave the shit in the tree, he's crying already You, boy, you live on your urges, but a human being - has lost its instinct of self preservation - which he had in the beginning of time I knew this before I even knew how to read Yes, now let's go straight forward Or what do you say? There it is then THE CABIN BY THE FUCKING DRAIN Well now, here we are Here we can be left alone Or what do you say, buddy? "Moshe Dayan's quickly arranged visit - happens while the king or Jordan, - Hussein, is currently in London.

Yes, the veterinary An animal belongs to the nature I noticed an impressive cliff rock by the trail Is it perhaps an old sacrificial site? What were you doing over there? It's just a tourist trap If even that You take some too Well, not then, not then. Did you find a better friend? They sacrificed animals before the site put them to sleep or tied down to die by themselves For the heavenly God a white animal - and for Mother Earth a brown one Do people still believe that One believes who believes Myself brought the war The brothers in arms were deployed then - on order by friends During the dangerous years I started to study, - The Finnish tribe's heritage, - then I came here to pick up a doctor's hat and stayed I live there in the wilds... - somewhere Hey... hare!

Well, it should be healthy again Look now and you'll understand You haven't taken care of the down payment on the mortgage Here's the latest electrical bill, telephone bill, insurance, - the member fees, tv-license I haven't even lived here. It doesn't concern me Then here's the population register's annotation - about an unfinished notification of changed address Then you were called in for reserve practice in the end of August Since you didn't show up, you're a deserter, - hiding away and not taking care of your affairs Couldn't you have cancelled my bills? They can't be cancelled just like that. They are on computers Is it possible for a man to become that twisted A human being can't fly anywhere No. We're trapped in a card index Even if I were to shred all receipts and bills, - the computer will keep on sending new ones over and over - until the end of the world With these computers you can compute thousands upon thousands of data in the fraction of a second There's information about all of us something about everyone and this information exist - on these magnetic tapes with electronic impulses My name's Vatanen Is my information here? How long is this information kept on the tape? Extensively as long as you don't push that button Rovaniemi, single. Thanks Now, should we put it on. For the freedom I didn't have the energy to pull you over to the bed I had a hare. One of those... Tame ones. It's over there by the bookshelf In a cage It became completely impossible when you offered it booze, - though you should be put in jail too even though you're this big Drink this, it helps Thanks You're so friendly Why are you being so formal my good man? Who are you? Leila, that much you could have remembered Yes, probably... Where in Helsinki are we? We're in Turku. - What? We're in Turku But we have to catch the 12 o'clock train to Helsinki To Helsinki? Police questioning. Maybe they'll put you in jail Ah, you... You know? I know everything about you, after listening to you for five days You don't know just how well I know you Sorry Hey, how did we come about ending up in Turku? Because I live here We met in Helsinki where you had been drinking - a whole day and night already We were in Hyvink?? and Janakkala - where we visited my parents And in Hanko we rode bikes And here we've been for two days I'm on vacation now, darling Hey, what kind of darling am I? Anyway, you're engaged Guess who. - With some economist No, guess again. - You guess, who I'm with I know, but you guess who I'm with It can't be that important, I'm tired I'll tell you. You're engaged to me No, fucking hell I'm married Sweetie, it'll work out, after all I'm a lawyer This is a bit unusual. A choice has been made after all Since there haven't been an indictment towards the tame hare, - that belongs to the all too quickly judged Vatanen, - and that there's no reason to believe that it has committed any crime, that could lead to an arrest or imprisonment and since the hare... therefore can't be placed - in custody together with Vatanen, - the Helsinki high council has deemed it necessary to authorize a request for him to have his hare together with him in custody and also decide to leave the hare - in attorney Heikkinen supervision until further notice And only for the time of Vatanen's search in custody The decision can be appealed - to the Helsinki court of appeal within 30 days What's the name of the hare? It's a wild animal. It doesn't have a name Well, then the prosecutor, here you go Mister chairman, - I consider it clear that advertising editor Kaarlo Oskari Vatanen has as an able-bodied worker - being idle and without enough residence permits strolling from state to state without seeking employment, - neglected to file a change of address For misleading the government by signing with phony names in the lodge books - failed to appear for the reserve practice carried a shotgun without a license and shooting ducks without a hunting license deliberately throwing rocks - to destroy deodorant ads and with violence trying to stop the mobilized officer - from doing his assignment - and deliberately destroyed - not only himself, but 25000 other people - regarding data information very well knowing that they're important for the safety of Finland Mister chairman That's why I demand that Vatanen is required to - attend a job institution and that he's convicted for - continued misleading of the government, damage to property - for violent resistance against a police officer - and for destroying important parts of the security of Finland Furthermore... - You're accusing me for - not wanting to live with you and for being in your books and statistics I say, - that a worthy human life is possible only in special circumstances and I've found it You're accusing me for throwing rocks at deodorant ads while drunk, - but can't yourselves comprehend even while sober, the crimes that are committed every day towards the next generation Already, the waste from the nuclear power plants should be able to be stored very carefully It should be able to stored for the next 200000 years - for the continuation of life Did you hear me? 200000 years From our calendar's start - it's only been 2000 years and already what does that contain? Stop, that does not belong to the case Can anyone guarantee that in 200000 years - there won't be any wars, natural disasters, - anything that could release nuclear waste? Can you guarantee... Mister chairman, the defendant files for acquittal In our society there are certain standards for defacement and destroying property of others It's not like we live in the woods Your divorce is ready then. Now you can wear this ring I paid your part of the mortgage Sign here Here are some other papers too, when you fully have to - register with society again You didn't know what kind of woman you fooled I've gotten your old work place secured At start Huuhtanen was unkind, but when I explained, - how the sabbatical year has renewed you and what kind of fresh ideas you have about environmental issues, he became very eager They're starting on a big project for the Minister of Environment and your ideas will be awesome You lead the project and with it a significantly higher salary The project is buried before I get out of here You underestimate me The mental examination report looked good - and your exceptional speech - was very perplexing But I'm not mad A little boy grown up is what you are And now stops the playing, dear Vatanen ATTORNEY AGENCY HEIKKINEN- KETTUNEN-SJ?BLOM Hare!
