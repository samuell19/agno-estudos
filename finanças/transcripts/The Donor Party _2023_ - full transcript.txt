Hi-- uh, wow, look at you! And that-- all of that. What are you doing here? I mean, it's f-- funny seeing you here. I-- I thought you had an apartment downtown. Uh-- uh, we-- we bought a house around the corner. For the schools. Uh, you remember Gia, don't you? Uh, yeah, last time I saw her, her face was kinda covered by your crotch. I heard you got married. Congratulations. Thank you. Oh, that's sweet of you to say. Thank you. Yeah, I'm a dad! Yeah! Yeah, how'd that happen? I mean, I know how that happened. Just you always said you didn't want babies when we were married. Yeah. Oh, turns out uh, I was wrong. Kids are great. He's a great dad. Really happy for you guys. Thank you. Uh, I couldn't be-- well, we-- We couldn't be happier, you know? I'm living my best life. Yeah, me, too. Yeah. Alright. Well, um, we should get going. -Okay. -Gotta get this in the ground. -Yeah, yeah. -You know? But it was really-- -Dig it deep. -It was great to-- -Oh, I-- -You know? Come on. Let's not smother the-- Really great. Yeah. So great to see you. Can I help you? Hi. Uh, yeah. Um, the-- I have a-- there's a-- I have this plant. Um, uh, I-- it's a dwarf tangerine and I-- I bought it here a year ago, and it-- It's grown some, it just-- it doesn't grow any fruit. And I've tried everything, even like a citrus stake. I think it's growing great! these leaves are gorgeous and lush. But you see this? Something happened to it. Disease? Trauma? Is it gonna die? No, no, it'll keep growing, but it'll never bear fruit. That was supposed to be me, you know? - Yeah. - He said, "Kids will change us. -And I love us." -Men ain't shit. I thought he would change when you had kids and-- Or my brother had kids, and when his cousins had kids, and I waited, and I waited, and then-- he just didn't wanna have kids with me! I know. And this is probably the wrong time to say, "I told you so," but, honey, I've literally been telling you the exact same thing for 15 years. I wasted all my good eggs on that asshole. And now, I'm never gonna be a mom! - No. Yes. - I'm never gonna be a mom! Yes, you are. You just-- you have to get back out there. I am out there! And it's like every good guy is married or they don't wanna have kids. Or-- or-- the older guys, they already have kids and don't wanna have any more. Or the young guys, they just wanna fuck a MILF. But I'm not even a MILF, I'm just an ILF! I just-- I just wanna skip the dating part and get to the mom part. I just-- No. No, don't skip the dating part. The dating part is where all the good fun sex happens. You know, when you-- when you get to the mom part, it's just you know, scheduled sex once a week and the foreplay is like he brushes his teeth. That's me. My mom was the best and she made me feel like I could do anything. And like I was exactly perfect just the way I was. I wanna do that for a little one. I wanna be that mom for somebody. I don't know why you're trippin'. You don't need a husband to have a baby. No, that's true. You can totally adopt! Oh, although adoption is not cheap. I have friends who did it and it's like-- It's like 40 grand all said and done. Oh,fuck me! I wasn't talkin' about adoption. Artificial insemination is worse. Mike and Lydia, they went through six IVF treatments at 25 grand a pop. Well, fuck me! You don't have to buy it. Just go and get some. What? Where are you getting? What? You know, get some. Mm. Mm, mm, mm. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. -Oh. -That's called "stealing sperm". It's not stealing if they freely give it away. -Uh. -Condoms break. Accidents happen. Especially if you plan 'em. No, that insane. You can't do that. You can't just-- Although, I mean, if there-- No. It's just-- it's wrong. Is it-- is it wrong? I mean-- I mean, it could work. -Right. -It could work. What's happening right now? -I kinda think you're the devil. -Mm. But it is not the worst idea ever. If you're talking about what I think you're talking about, then it is the worst idea. -It's the best worst idea. -Oh! How will he ever find out? You know, I'm not going to call him to tell him. You guys aren't going to call him and tell him. I'm not calling him. I mean, most guys ghost me anyway. And this time, I want him to ghost me. And he gets to have sex with you and you get a baby. Win-win. Waa-waa. Okay, I think you guys are forgetting something. Right, um-um. What if the sperm is slow or he's shooting blanks? Huh, we'll have a back up. I'm thinking two, maybe three. We gotta flood the fallopian tubes when the egg drops. Yeah, yeah. You're-- you're talking about an orgy? It's like having three one-night stands in the same night. Okay. Oh my god. No. No, I can't do this. This is crazy. I don't want to just fuck some rando to get a baby. That's why I can't go to the sperm bank in the first place. Besides from the fact that it will bankrupt me. I want to know that the father of my child is a good person. - Right? Yeah. - You know? Like a kind person. Ideally artistic and intelligent and good sense of humor. Argh, who the fuck am I kidding? I'll just freeze my eggs until I find Mr. Right. Idea. What if we found them for you? Is there nuts in that? Huh, I don't know. I can put nuts in it for you. Would you like that? I can put nuts anywhere you'd like. Okay, babe, shut it down. We have guests. Alright, but mom has the kids so we will have time for your special birthday treat later. Don't get too fucked up. I won't. I have an idea though. What if we just send all these jokers home and we have later now? How about that? All of our best friends, you mean those jokers? Well, what about her? What about that joker? I don't know her. Who is she? That's Jackie's friend from work. -Oh, the lesbian. -Yes. Yeah. Why is she here? She's Jackie's plus one. Oh, okay. Oh! Are they-? No. What? Just- Well, why-- why is Jackie coming? Because she is like family. Is she like family though? I don't know. Maybe I just had it in my head that we were going to take a Jackie break after thanksgiving. Alright, she had just found out that Todd was getting remarried. -I know. -Just found out. Believe me. I was sympathetic with all the crying and the carrying on. But did she have to teach our six-year-old about blowjobs? -She did- -All about blowjobs? She didn't hear the whole thing. -Soup to nuts. -She didn't- No, no. Yes. Maybe the soup but not the nuts. That's not even our job to do that. -Alright, you know what? -It's the internet's job. You will barely know that she is here. Okay. I can do this. It's just casual sex. I can do that. I can totally do that. The table looks great. Wait, why are the desserts out already? Do you guys have everything you need? Yes, we do honey. Thank you. -Hi. -Hey, whose playlist is this? These are Geoff's favorite songs. Oh god. - Nope, can't do it. - No, Jaclyn. No, stop, stop, stop, stop. No, no, no, no, no, no. On paper, this all sounded great. But now that I'm actually here, I can't. I can't do it. Okay, well, just listen. I will 100% agree. But please don't leave me here. I- If I have to have one more conversation about IPOs, I will murder someone. Hold on, what's going on? She's reconsidering. No, no, no. You cannot back out. Yes, I can. Because this is crazy. Yes, it is crazy. Like Uber Eats and Standing Desk. But crazy can be genius. Great dress. Yeah. You don't think it's too much? -It's very good. Oh. -It's gonna get the job done. No, ah! Huh, I was gonna return it. Oh, oops. I'm sorry. $450? See? That's what I'm talking about. This dress is not me. Sleeping with three guys is not me. Okay, it is not you. That's clear. Now, is this how you wanna have a kid? No. But is this the only option? Yes. Okay? We did our part. You gotta do your part. You promise that there's no way they can find me afterwards. No, you just need to make sure that no one figures out what you're doing tonight. Because I will 100% throw you under the bus if Geoff finds out that I was part- Hi. -Hey. -Oh, hey. Jackie, good to see you again. Yeah, you too. Happy birthday. It's a book. Could've sworn it was a canoe. It's signed to you. Oh, wow. Thank you. Oh, and isn't it lint? I mean, didn't you give up refined sugar last year? I thought you did. What are you giving up this year? I'm just giving up. -Okay. -He's literally just turning 45. - I know, right? - Thank you so much. I mean, what's the matter with me? Doom and gloom here. Here, let me take this. Here, you put this up. Oh my gosh. Yes, I would love to. It'd be my pleasure. Is he okay? He's fine. None of the men in his family lived past 88. So, now he thinks he's in a downfall spiral. I thought you said this was gonna be a big shin dick. Yeah, well, it turns out Geoff doesn't have enough friends to make it a shin dicks. Well, someone's gonna notice. Too late for that now because donor number one is ready to play. So, are you ready? Well, my ovulation app says it's go time. Go on then. Seize the day. ♪ Come to me ♪ ♪ Just bring your mouth ♪ ♪ closer to my-- ♪ Hi. Oh. Hi. - Hi. - I'm MJ. What's going on? Did you know this was a birthday party? Yeah. Yeah, I did. Oh, okay. I kind of really don't know why I'm here. I'm not even that good friends with Amandine or at all, actually. Well, you can I can be friends. Wow, thank you. Friends with benefits, if you want. - Okay. - Um, so MJ, huh, that's not short for Maryjane, is it? No, no. I wish. Actually, no. I don't wish that my name was Maryjane. -No. -No. And my MJ is for Morris Jerusalem. Morris is my mother's grandfather's name. And Jerusalem is the city where I was conceived. -Oh, that's nice. -I often say, well, thank goodness that I wasn't conceived in Frankfurt because then I'd be quite an MF. -Guys. -Hi. You want to try some of this? It's pretty good. Oh, no, thank you. I'm taking an Uber later. And I like to be of sound mind when I'm -in a car with a stranger. -Oh. Okay, well, you have got to try this. - It's a Syrah. - Okay. Give it a shot. Tell me what you think. - Mm. Wow. - Not bad, right? -Yeah. -Almost makes up for the fact that they call it Syrah Syrah. Ugh. My ex-wife was the regional sales manager for the state. Um, she ran off with the sommally-- the sommally- the fucking wine guy. She ran off with the wine guy. Ah, got you. - Yeah. - Should I spit it out? Would you please? It would make me feel so good. - I'm Armin by the way. - Hi. Hey. You're Molly's friend? The one who works for Jennifer Aniston's charity, right? Oh, I actually did the Standee for you guys. Yeah, my company- Hey, my company works-- we actually make those cardboard standees that, you know, you can sit on star's lab in a movie lobby? -Yeah. -That's cool. Yeah. So, wait. So you know Amandine as well? Uh, she's just a work friend. I mean, you know, she wouldn't know where I live or anything like that. Actually, I don't even work there anymore. I'm moving away to another city far away. Wow. So, Jen is more "Horrible bosses" than Rachel in real life. Noted. No, no, no. She's great. It's just I needed a challenge. Wanted to mix things up a bit, so... You know what? I think that is so healthy to shift gears. Geoff and I- Well actually, most of the guys here, we had a start up. Not like Amazon or anything. But once I got big enough, I had to sell it. Now, I can kind of do whatever I want. It's pretty cool. - Yeah. That's nice. - Yeah. Yeah, that's really cool. I actually put money into GameStop as well. I don't know, well, and I made $3700. - Oh wow. - Nice, buddy. - Yeah, thanks. - It's pretty good. So, it's like, saying-- Now I got a lot of free time, get to travel. Which I love so much. I was working so much before. Right, I guess. Takes a minute to start up. Oh yeah. I mean, all I did was code, code, code and pound energy drinks. Wow. That's why I'm trying to see as much as the world- I'm so sorry. It's just my mom broke her hip. - Oh my god. - Oh my god. I'm just dealing with my brothers. We're trying to figure out if we should put her in our home. Oh, let me know if you need any help or- Nope, done. Done. -Oh, great. -I'm sorry, you were saying? Love to travel. -I have a lot of time. -I'm scared of planes. To do that. But um- She's gonna bail. Well, it sounded to me like you didn't want her to go through with it. It's not true. But do you know how hard it is to find a single man who is disease free in the suburbs? I just- I don't want to disappoint them. It is possible that I may have told them that I have a friend in need of a- Like, a confidence boost. So you're more worried about your guys friends being happy than your best friend? Okay, well call it a win-win situation. I mean, what's so wrong with having a plan B? Oh, I've got a plan B. I've got a plan C. Because the plan is to get her the D. What is it? - What is that? - It's molly. I don't- MDMA. -I don't under- -E. I don't know what you're saying. Ecst- Ecstasy. -I know that one. -Ecstasy, yes. Just enough to prime the pump. Okay. Oh, donor number three. The French teacher whose wife just died. Okay. My friend getting pregnant tonight. Top me off, will you? Oh god, I thought you were the caterer. I am so sorry. Behind the table, cool outfit. I can take it off. Okay. More, more. I like this one. It's floral and complex and yeasty. Like a vagina? I get a slightly different note. It's got a really good mouth fill. I could decant it for you. Let it breathe. Amadine. Barbara. That's a beautiful name. Not my name. I hate my name. I'll tell you what. How about you give me your number and I'll call you whatever or whenever you want. Balls. Yo, Goeff. Can I grab you for two, buddy? -Hi. -Hey, what's up? What's up? Were you just hitting on my sister? Is that a real question? Right, right. Umm, it's just that she's been through a really ugly divorce recently. So... So, you want me to sleep with your sister? That's sweet of you. No. No, no. No, I'm just- I'm worried. I mean, you know, she's very- she's not a lesbian. Are you sure? Because, you know- Would you mind not hitting on my sister at my birthday party please? I would mind. But I won't. It will be my present to you. Wow, thank you so much. - Happy birthday. - Yeah, I'll treasure it. - You should. - Have a great time. - You too. - Not too great. Oh, shit. Oh shit. -Oh shit. -No one told me about this. There's just no good- you know what? Every 10 minutes I have to go. Sweetheart, you can get lasers. It'll zip that right back up. Yeah, it's called a mommy makeover. They stick a laser up there and just tighten it all up. It went from Basset Hound to Chihuahua. Worth every penny. Oh! - Wow. - Stop. You know it's true. You got kids? -No. -Husband? Not anymore. You should keep your distance. You might get baby fever. I'm not kidding. Happened to me. All my friends started having kids. I thought I should have kids. All these friends, they're gonna be gone once she pops a baby out. She'll make new friends. The kids' friend's parents. And she'll think she has new "interests." But they're really the kids' interests. And when the kids graduate, poof, gone so. All these people she invested all her time with, she'll realize she has nothing in common with them. And then she'll realize that her husband is staying too late at work. So, she'll shoot her face fill with Botox, get a boob job. Get a mommy makeover? Exactly. To chase what she used to look like. before the kids literally suck the life out of her. Instead, she'll just look like she's trying too hard. And he'll leave her for an actual 20-year-old. Who loves giving blowjobs? Fucking blowjobs. All because she thought it'd make her life complete -to have a baby. -Oh, no, no. That's got Molly's lipstick on it. -I think this is your shade. -Thank you. I mean, you don't regret having babies, right? Oh, no. God, no. They're the loves of my life. As much as I hate my ex, I'll always be grateful to him for giving me my babies. Listen to me, don't listen to me. I just need to get laid. Okay. We get what you wish for. On that note, I think I'm ready. - Alright. - Do you snorkle? No, I never get into the ocean. Oh god, what do I say? Tell him how wet your pussy is. They love that. I hate that word. Pussy? Yeah. What do you say? I don't. So, when you told Todd to like- Oh, we didn't talk during- Or before. Or after. Oh God. Okay, so tonight, you're gonna say some nasty pornstar shit. Just get disgusting. Yeah, but that's not me. I know that's not you. But tonight, you're not you. Okay? You're not the NPR-loving, farmer's market going, avocado toast eating Jaclyn. You're gonna be something different. You're the Onlyfans, like Jacklina. You're gonna be a slut tonight, okay? Yeah, okay. Okay. You're a slut. -Well, huh. -Slut. Slut - Really? - Yeah. You've never been to swimming? Hey. Hey. Hi. Oh. You like surfing? Huh, no, I would never surf. So, you'd never- you just-- you never do it? No, I'm scared of sharks. There is great white sharks that you should be scared of. But they're east coast, man. All the west coast sharks are white sharks. I got you, girl. Cuddly nice sharks. You gotta get out there. Geoff is over there. Geoff?I'm Shopia. Excuse me. Okay. Am I in trouble? No. Ugh, God, I need a drink. Your glass is right there, just-- Oh no, molly. Molly, that's Molly in there. You drank it all. That's all of it. It's gone. It's in your body now. -Okay. -Okay, wow. -Let's just- -What? Wow, wow. Don't need those. -Right, um. -Yeah, so. -Oh. -Wow, wow. Wow, that is- That is so tone. Oh, thank you. You do pilates? I do, yeah. I can tell, I can tell. You can touch it if you want. I would. I want. Okay. Alright. Okay, you're sure that you want me to do this? I think I couldn't be more clear. Yeah, I do. I do want you to do this. - Okay. - Yeah. Okay. Great. I'll be over here. Okay. Oh, wait, I don't have a condom or anything. Oh, ah! You know, I don't want to assume when I go out this- I just- it's just in the bag. There's a-Oh, do you have a medium? -Here. -Okay, wow. Wait, we should set the mood? I have Spotify premium, no ads. - We don't need that. - I can put a slow jam playlist. Okay, wait. I've- I've never done this before. -Well, no, I mean I've had sex. -Yeah, okay, good. That's great. You know, but- Not with people around. It's just us here. Wait, that's not true. That's not true. Actually when I was in college, my girlfriend and I, we went camping. -Wow. -Consensual. And- and-wow. Wow. And there was a tent next to us. And there were people having sex in there loudly. Say some pornstar nasty ass shit. It's not like- I will murder. They ruined our lives. Pussy. I want you to murder my pussy. Excuse me? I want you to tell me. How you're gonna murder my pussy? -Yeah. -Okay. Well, I'll use my penis to strangle it until it's dead. Yeah. Oh. No, this is weird. This is weird, I'm sorry I don't- I'm sorry. I don't talk like that.I'm sorry. It's okay. I just thought talking dirty would turn you on. I don't know what to do to turn you on. I don't know how to do this. Are you kidding me? You? You do not have to use any gimmicks to turn me on. Honestly, I would really just love to kiss you. If that's okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would love that. Hey you guys. Are you doing okay? Do you have everything you need? -Thank you so much. -I want you to have the best time ever. Oh, thank you. Oh my god, baby. You guys look great together. It's just such a beautiful couple. Stay the night if you want. Make yourselves at home. Hey girl, let me talk to you. Hey, come on over here. - How are you feeling? - Oh my gosh. I feel great. I love these people. These are- these are good people. - Yeah. - Oh, I forgot. The donor number three cancelled. Who are you gonna get to fill the empty slot? Her empty slot, like, a vagina? - That was good. - Like, her vagina. I know a guy, I'll call him. But you need to sit down. Oh my god, you are such a good friend. You know, we should do things, you and me. It doesn't always have to be the three of us. Right? Just call me, girl. And also, you're so pretty. I never told you that before. I want it, but I'm not going to. - You better not. - Because I know I shouldn't. I'm doing the work. Good, good, okay. Do you wanna touch my hair? My hair is so soft. I have a conditioner that costs $125. - That's a lot of money. - That's so dumb. It's beautiful. Okay, I'm gonna go call my guy, but you sit down, alright? Don't do a lot of things. Okay. I'll sit in my den. I have a great chair in there. - Lay out. - It's fluffy. Hi, where's the closest bathroom? It's right over there. Wow, your boobs got big. Do they hurt yet? They will. When you start nursing. Are you gonna nurse? I loved nursing so much. Oh my gosh. But it does hurt when it chafes. And I got mastitis so bad one time, Geoff had to put a hot compress on my boobs and milk me like a cow. Oh, this is so much information. -Are you okay? -Oh, no. They got better. Thank you for asking that. Hey, so-- and the bathroom is there. Thank you. Remember, breast feeding is best feeding. Okay. Hello? I'm almost done. I'm almost done. Okay. Well, pregnant lady needs to pee-pee. I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Okay. I'll find another. Good luck with that. -That was fun. -Yeah. Yeah, that was fun. Okay. Oh no. Oh no. What? The condom broke. Oh, no. Oh. Oh my god. I'm so, so, sorry. I don't know how this happened. You know maybe- Maybe you're just- You're too big and the condom burst. That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. This is just- I'm on the pills, it was just- You know, in case of STDs. Oh, don't worry about that. I'm clean. I give my blood to Quest all the time. They should give me a punch card. What? Oh, I have a blood disorder. What? Like, are you a hemophiliac or-? No, no. I just bruise really easily. You know? Oh, up here. -See that? -Oh. That's from a collision with a shopping cart. Oh, thank god. For you. Yeah. It's pretty funny actually. Child protective services used to call my parents -all the time. -Oh. Yeah. Why don't you go first. And then I'll come later. Just so it's not so conspicuous. - Oh, you mean now? - Yeah. Okay. - Hey, it's me, Amandine. - Oh, okay. ♪ Well, I'm gonna put you down on the microphone ♪ ♪ And drop down low like Al Capone ♪ Okay. Getting a little help from gravity. Listen, I totally appreciate you finding him. He was super right. But did you know that he had a blood disorder? Okay, getting a full DNA workup was not on the checklist. But on a related note, donor number three did cancel. Oh, the French teacher? - Oui. - Crap, he sounded promising. Well, on an unrelated note, there might be a little itsy-bitsy problem with Molly. Argh, is she drunk? - Well, I wouldn't say drunk. - Oh, she used to do this to me all the time in college. I'd meet a guy I was really into, and then she'd get super hammered and then I'd have to walk her back to dorm room. That's probably it. I'm gonna go. I'mma see you out there. - Hey. - What? Can you get me a snack? No. Kahlil, get on up here buddy. Your turn, your turn. You burn him. Happy birthday, buddy. There we go. Alright, this is my favorite. In his garage, we're working about to make millions. Right. - And what happens? - His septic tank breaks. And so, we are literally working in a shit. And what did you say to me? What did you say? - I couldn't smell it. - Couldn't smell it. Couldn't smell his own shit. I just thought you guys were trying to get out of working. - We were. - Well, shut up about it. -I destroyed-- -Tim! Everybody, Tim is here. Tim is here. All of the beautiful artwork that we have in our house, it's almost all him. I love them. I was gonna ask. I love the dog paintings. So fun. Yeah, I tried to buy it all. You basically did, I mean. Jackie, Jackie, it's Tim time. It's Tim time. Tim. - Shh. - Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie. -Come on. -Tim time. -Tim time. -Wait, what's Tim time? Honey, your gift is here, and your's. Here we are. Yap, careful, careful. It's still little wet. - So is she. - Excuse me, excuse me. What-? Oh my god. Wow. -I mean- -MOLLY: Look at that. Thank you. Thank you, Molls. Aww. Alright. Wow. Wow. Okay. Alright. She just loves art. You know? Yeah, yeah. -Yummy. -God. Tim, I mean this is phenomenal. Really phenomenal. How did you get the-? Well, for your face, I actually used one of your old wedding photos. I had to age it up just a little bit. - Just a little bit. - Okay. And then for you body, I used that guy. - How are you doing? - Oh, man. Yeah. He's pretty proud of himself. It is so good. Oh, he's so talented. He does baby portraits too. You have to do our's. Okay, okay. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Yes. Thank you. So you must really love dogs. Um, actually I'm allergic. You know, people just send me pictures of their dogs and then I paint them. But you must like them a little bit, right? I don't. I can't stand them. They slobber. They crap on the floor. They eat your shoes. But people love dogs, so easy money. I don't understand what's going on. We were just very friendly and then who the hell is this guy? Yeah, so what he's got a handsome face and perfect hair and considerable talent? Oh god. Oh okay, alright. You know what would make a good impression? A Jeff Goldblum standee. She loves him. You will be like her hero. Yeah, but right now, all I have is some of the Dodgers. And an old Batman. To the Batomobile then. I'll be back. That was the terminator. Oh my god, I'm losing it, Amandine. I'm losing it. Go find it, go find it. Okay. I'm coming right back. Okay, so what about babies? I can't stand babies. I'm sorry, I can't stand them. Babies are- babies are stupid. I mean, you ever tried to have a conversation with a baby? It's remarkably one-sided. Well, they're babies, so they can't even talk. Because babies are stupid. So, you don't like babies or dogs? Or surfing. I hate surfing. Well, how do you make art about something you don't even like? That's why they call us starving artists. Speaking of which, there's the food. Excuse me. Okay, we got a problem. MJ got feelings. -What do you mean feelings? -Like, feelings feelings. You need to bounce off before he gets back, okay? Well, I'm thinking of bouncing right now. Absolutely not. No. One D down. Two more Ds to go. I can't do this. Yes, you can. The goal is to be a hoe. Mom. Hoe now, mom later. There's a through line. Okay. Wow. You weren't kidding about the starving artist. It's Pavlovian. All these art openings always have amazing spreads, and if I keep my mouth filled with food, people think they're rude if they come up to me and ask me "What were you trying to say with this piece?" Just give you the money and leave you alone, right? You wanna be my agent? Oh, here we go. Yeah. I'm sure she's perfectly nice, but I get hit on by that type all the time. What's your type?
