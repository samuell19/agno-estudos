- So, hello and welcome. - Hello. Oh, thank you. I'm Kristýna Coufalová from MarkPoll company. Today, we've got a focus group, which is a moderated discussion. This time, it's research related to Apoteka Havlík - Organic Cosmetics We'll spend 90 to 120 minutes together, so I hope we'll have a great time. You may react at any time, everybody's welcome to do so. Not all organic's organic, right. - They say it's organic, but it isn't. - That's what I'm talking about. I check it, I don't wanna stuff myself with chemicals, so... Yeah, it's important. I started checking this with the kid. You must be careful what you give them. He always threw up. I hadn't realized until then what actual sensitivity was. Well, when I have a kid, I'll definitely want to buy organic stuff. But then the kid starts puking, you must check even organic stuff. - Yeah? - It's totally unpredictable, really. - What's the problem? - Same as with the skin. But I think it's just marketing, these days. Organic is super trendy now, but I don't think there's much difference. That actually...they know it's trendy now, so they use it just as a branding. But I don't suppose it'll always be like this. And what do you think about this product? That it's local. That's great. I guess it's organic. They say so here, yeah. - Like, it looks good. - I really dig the design. And what is your opinion on social media? I'm a blogger, so I test the products myself, I always tell the truth. We're a community, right? We swap advice, chat about what we like. What? I don't really follow celebrities.. Or, like... - Sure. - ...it's totally strange to me. - Well, nobody's forcing you. - Yeah. Sorry. What does partnership mean for you? It's major for me. That's my whole life. It's one of the things I describe on my blog, We discuss with my partner different problems. I think it's good to be able to share the problems. We always get back together. And that's what partnership is about. That we're still together. Or... You meant, romantic relationships? - Yes, yes. - Yeah, alright. I think I've got a broader perspective. Like, some sensitivity, for others too... Some kinda equal approach to all. The partnership may be... - It's kinda a partnership here, too. - You can even be partners with a dog. Totally. And what is self-love for you? Well, loving yourself, right. Good point. I mean, it sounds corny, but it's hard, isn't it. - Accepting yourself the way you are. - Totally. - With all the flaws. - With your imperfections. Exactly. See the ad, but don't take it personally, in a bad way. - Don't compare yourself. - Exactly! Like, don't chase some unattainable ideal. - And that's, well... hard. - A constant struggle. You've got the documents ready. Fine. A nice sweater. Right. I had it yesterday already. Sorry for complimenting it only today. It's alright. Would you like to come again? - Look... I'm busy. - Right. And I've told you I'm not looking for anything. Didn't look like it the last time. I need to work. If at least one sperm penetrates the egg, you may conceive. If conception is unwanted, it may be prevented even after unprotected sex or if contraception fails. The pill prevents an unplanned pregnancy. They contain levonorgestrel - a hormone present in many contraceptive pills. The pills work as contraceptives, but also after intercourse. - How are you feeling? - ...as they or prevent ovulation. It's because it postpones high concentration... Have you taken it? ...of luteinizing hormone, that is also known as LH Wave. The egg cannot leave the ovary, ovulation does not occur, conception neither. I'm sorry. This way, it prevents conception before it happens. Right... So, hello everybody. This is, like, the first and the last video that I'm making. I simply had to. Because the stuff I see here on facebook. That's totally nutness, OK? It's simply... Those cheeky young chicks, reading your cards, when they know nothing? They'll just mess with your heads, guys. Everyone must decide for themselves, OK? It's... Messing with someone's business, OK? When they know nothing about it... It's not right. The audacity! Playing with fire, OK? And they take your money for this? 20 Euros! For a question! For a single question! That's just... How much should I charge for a question? Is it...? 5? ?15? If you come here, and say, one question. Well, Imma do that for free. Well... That's me! But... You can come for all weekend, OK? It's beautiful here, there's a mill, river... You simply, like, connect to the nature. Just, feel the flow from within. Not just one question, the whole topic. The whole healing, right? Like, the ritual. There's accommodation here... And you'll have food here, OK? You can go really deep. Not, like, one question deep, OK? What do those chicks even know? Messing with what they shouldn't. Now that farce with the vaccination. That's madness! I won't make any readings for vaccination! That's up to each of you, guys! Use your brain! You must choose your own fortune teller. Like, my daughter... I mean, niece... She's vaxxed, and she's fine, OK? I didn't get the jab myself, cuz... You never know what crap's in it, OK? But reading cards for this? And paying ?20 for a question... That's total bullshit! Sorry, but... But... The summer's awesome here, OK? Here, it's... I'm alone here. One should be alone, OK? Cuz you connect, to, like, your inner self. Not like in the city, with all that noise. But there's...solitude, here, OK? It's so beautiful here, OK? And like... You can't be afraid. Avoid fear. Cuz what will it attract? Misfortune. Alright? So, just, like... positivity, OK? Here it is, a card of the day? On Facebook. A card of the day? Like... simply... what? Or astrology? Like, what do we, fortune tellers, even know about that? Cards are about the unconscious, right? Why are we playing astrologists, huh? Like... Maybe I'm traditional in this, OK? I take after my mum, but... Good fortune tellers are very rare. Whom I could recommend, well, Milena Votáhalová from Jihlava, OK? A lot has come true. Hello, Milena! I'll come too, I've got a question as well. Us fortune tellers need to ask too. But you must know who you're asking. Yeah? Not like here, just... unbelievable. Those chicks can't even see you, and will read your fortune here on facebook? Well, have a beautiful day, OK? And... think positive. And with your brain, OK? It's up to you, people, OK? Just don't get brainwashed on facebook. - Turn right in 40 meters, here, I guess. - Yeah, I think it's here. - Where? - Here. - Right in forty meters? - This wasn't forty meters. Doesn't matter. Just go straight, and turn right in 2 km. It's cool. I think it's gonna be awesome. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. - Just try to understand. - I'm a total mess! - I get it, mum, careful, a tree. - Yeah. I can see it. - Where to now? - Uh...Right, here... We're going the wrong way. Fine. Even a psychologist can have an anxiety. Here! Now, mum. I talked to that fortune teller, it looks good. Mum, I believe you, but it sounds... nuts. But alright. - It's important you go there with me... - Mum, there, that way. - So what should I do? I'll turn back. - Careful! Careful! I've told you I don't want to go there with you. Where should I turn? Into the house? No, but... Look. - But that's a house entrance. - So this way. There. - We've been there. - No, we were driving down, right? Sara, dear, please. We're going the right way. Drive up here. Like, this way up? - Well, the GPS says so. - OK, we're driving up. I'll trust you, then. - And... - And we're in a house. - But...Sara, dear, it's always like this. - Jesus, sorry. But it's funny, right? Well, funny... In my state, I can't reverse. So reverse this way. - Wait. So I've got to... Jesus Christ. - Well, I'm sorry... - I don't want us to die together! No way. - I really love you. - Wait, alright. - Wait! Jesus! We'll back straight into their house. I think we'll fall. No, we won't fall. I fell long ago, dearie, but I don't want to try it physically too. Mentally is enough. See, how... - Jesus Christ! - ...funny you are! Sorry. - Great that I can still amuse you. - That's surely our only chance. Sara dear, I love you, but I'm not tormenting just myself, but... well... It's not just about me, but right now, I'm a total mess. At least you see that! - Sorry! - A total mess! - Sorry! Just calm down. - Here we go! But better directions now. Alright, alright. Sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't want... No, I am sorry... But it's important we're there together Something's wrong. I do love you. But something is wrong between us. I'm worried about you, you've been out of work so long. - Jesus, I don't wanna discuss this, mum. - It's always this topic. Turn left. - Well, but you still haven't told me why. - Are you seeing someone? - I'm not. - That's two of us, then. Just look at us. - Slow down, please. - It's making me nervous. The talking, or the driving? - Both, I guess. - OK, I'm driving slower. - Jesus, where are we going? - Sara, dear, we're going to hell. - Obviously. - We're ruining the car. Wait... - Wait, we can ask someone. - Yeah, we'll have to turn around. - Turn again? You know I can't do that. - I dunno, then! - I need to go forward! - That's what I've decided. As a psychologist, that's my right. I need to go forward. Alright, alright. Let's turn here and go... I tell that to people. You mustn't turn back. You must go forward! Wait a sec, I'll move a bit. Jesus, reverse again, oh my god! Alright. Let's go. - And now you know? - Yeah, now I know. - Hello. - Oh, hello! - Hello. - Hello. - Welcome, I'm Zdena. - Kristina. - Sara. Hello. - This is Lenka. - Sara. - Kristina. - Lenka. - Come on in! May I help you? - I'll take this, maybe? - Oh, thank you! Here you go. I'll put the suitcase upstairs, OK? And Sara, you can give me that bag, I'll take it up too... Follow me. So, welcome, once again. Let's settle the formalities first. It is ?636, as we discussed. - Jesus, I've lost the money. - Well, we can go home then. Can I take a look? What it is for... It's alright. If you're ready, I'll take you to your room, show you around, and then take you to the oracle? So follow me. So, this is your room. I've brought your things, and if you need anything, I'm staying over here. Just knock, I'm mostly there. Are you hungry? - I'm fine. - Me too, I guess. Great. If you feel peckish, the kitchen's downstairs. There's some fruits, snacks. The dinner will be after, like, the first healing session. Anyway, I'll wait next door. Just settle here, and then knock. I'll take you to oracle. That's where Zdenka lives, in the other part, you won't even go there, so... That's all you need to know, I guess. See you later. Thanks. - It's pretty here, innit? - Uh-uh. Yeah. Very. For 600. Grand, just lavish, mum. Great. Didn't know you make so much money. You could have said. We can travel the world. Czechia. The money's not just for the room, but for the therapy, you know? Oh, yeah. The healing, as the lady said. - Yes. - Right, right. I want to try it. Because I'm really unwell, and you know that. Yes, I do. So I'll let you focus on the therapy and go for a walk. - Wait, Sara! - Like, you're not coming with me? - We've been through that, mum. - Don't force me, please, really, no. - Please! You really must be there. - But I'm here. With you. And I'll be here. With you. Every night, in this one bed. So can you leave me out of at least this part of the stay? Please. Fine, just go. Forget about me. It's fine. Totally fine. Now shuffle and think of your question. Alright. You know, it's quite cold here. - It's hard to heat up such a building. - Let's focus on the question, OK? Pick one deck. Well... The reading is definitely about relationships. There are The Lovers. That means mutuality. relationships, decisions...cooperation. But also relationship triangles. The Wheel of Fortune - that's fate. It's something deeper, for sure. But not about that relationship, I think. Here's The Star. Something you can't completely influence, but you're strong enough for it. Here's The Page of Swords. That represents some younger person. Some close relationship of yours. They're close to you, your inner circle. You're, like, more connected to them. It's a sharp person, with a sword, they can cut through things, decide. I think it relates to Sara. And it's actually something that prevents you from love. Here's The Ace of Cups. But she's not preventing you on purpose. She's the core of the issue on your side. Something unresolved here, with her. That man, there's mutual affection, he likes spending time with you. But it's not major for him. And it won't be for you, either. He's, like, a conduit. Someone who'll help you open the vibrations of love. But I think in the end, when you solve the problem, then you'll be the one who will leave the relationship. You'll stop being interested, you'll open up to something higher. A higher love. That Ace of Cups definitely says that the... the love... will come. But you've got to work for it, it's not for free. The swords are actually kinda painful. I think it'd be great if Sara came here. So that we can do her reading too. To look at the problem from her side. I'll try. I hope she'll do it for me. She's strong enough. - Hey. - Hi, where were you? For a walk. It's just that Zdenka and your mum have been there quite long. I know. Mum's here for healing, but I don't believe in this stuff much. So what are you doing here? - Like... I'll go for walks. - The Highlands, nice forests... Sure. Want one? Mmm... No. But thank you. I'll go to the town. There's bulgur in the fridge for dinner. Just put in in the microwave. - OK. Oh, and I wanted to ask you. - Any pub around here? I'd get a beer. There's nothing here. But... I can check on the way. I might find something. - OK, thanks, great. I'll pay you back. - Yeah, alright. - See you. - See you. You're, like, not talking to me? I thought you're the one not talking. Mum... Don't get sullen, please. - But I'm not sullen at all. - I'm just sad about that, is all. I know. Sorry. No, I apologize. For everything. I realize how terrible childhood must have been for you. That I was always depressed about some dumbass. But it's so insane... A love deficit is a terrible thing. When you're waiting, waiting, and nothing. You just get desperate, like. - So tell me, how was it? - Well... - What? What did you do? - Sat at a table. She's a fortune teller, she was reading cards. Incredibly interesting. Because what she was saying... Like, you suddenly feel someone sees right into your soul, you know? Interesting... A lot of food for thought, for me. And that's why I'm here. I need some clarity. - It's real pretty here. - Really? - Yeah. Beautiful nature, nice forests. - That's good. Mum, I know that... I know you're not feeling well. I can see that. I see it's worse than usual. I know you're sad, nervous, desperate... Depressed, anxious. I don't know how to describe it. Just... Desperate is what I am, Sara. Alright. Alright. Can you please at least hint at why you've decided... to go for a séance in the woods? I don't mean it in any bad way, OK? Like, what's happening, mama, what? Something happened, and I thought love would come, you know? That I'll finally be happy, in a relationship. Just... somebody appeared. - Wait, you're seeing someone? - Well, not really. I don't know. Do I know him? So who is he? A colleague, from work. Which one? Tomas. The doorman? You're silly! He's about hundred-year-old! Then I'd see why we're here, you'd wanna know if he survives. There's no other Tomas, is there? There is. He sits in my office. No. No-o. - Why no? - No, mum! No. Look... One thing is, he's my age, OK? So what? Doesn't matter. Right. That's cool. Like... But the other thing, he's a total idiot. A total dickhead, mum. Total! The ultimate, enormous dickhead with capital D. - Come on, how can you even say that? - Well, I totally can. - You don't even know him! - He makes a pass at everyone. Sara, don't you be telling stories! Mum! He's even tried it with me. Everyone at your work knows it. You're just saying it out of spite. I'm saying it because I love you, you deserve truth. You weren't there. I've had the most beautiful moments ever with him That's simply swell. I can just imagine that. Well, I just had some hope. For how long has... this thing been going on? What thing? Like, how long have you been together? Well... We're not really together. So he's just sleeping with you. - That's not exactly it either. - Such a dickhead. We've had a few awesome days together. Well put. A few. A great phrase: a few. A few nice days are just perfect, mum. Even I can give you therapy for this. I'll just do the reading for you. Alright. Not nice, but amazing, beautiful days. Amazing. - Yes. Yes. - Noo. He just gave me hope, by what he was saying, but then he acts like, as if we... - Like a dickhead. - Not like a dickhead, like a lunatic! - That's what I want to comprehend here. - We're here because of him! We're here because of such a... ...such a sleazy fellow. Watch your words, please. Unbelievable. - So, however it ends up... - I just want to comprehend. And plan accordingly, but the fortune teller said you should come with me. I just can't believe my ears. Alright, mum. So if you really want me to go with you. If it's your wish... If you insist, if you think it will really help you... Then fine. You know what? I'll go with you. OK? - Alright. - Alright. Are we done? May I go to sleep? - Alright. - Alright. Sara, but you can't say it like this. Like what? How do you want me to say it? Should I change my tone? Speak English? Or I dunno... Should I be merry? OK, then: I'm super duper excited to go with you tomorrow to a séance to some hut, where we'll read cards. Alright? Don't be silly, please. I want you to understand it's important to me, I'll be grateful to you for this. Mum... I will... Alright, I'll do it for you. And can you please stop discussing how... How I say it? It's important I go, right? - Alright. - Alright. - Cool? Are we going to sleep? - Yeah. And it's about you too, I don't want you to end up like me. OK. Thank you. - It's nice you're doing it for your mum. - Yeah, I'm glad we're here. - We'll do just some basic reading. - Yeah, yeah. Let's look at it. Of course, if you had any question... - Sure, about relationships, and stuff... - That's what people ask, right? Yeah. Exactly. - Good morning. - Hi! Good morning, here you go. How did you sleep? Not that well. But that's normal these days. Not your fault. I'm sorry. - Have I missed anything? - No, everything's great. I'll go... Lenka, you know everything, right? - Yeah, yeah. - So let's meet afterwards. Can I get some coffee? I've got tea - lady's mantle. It's a female herb. Would you like some? Oh... I'd love to try. Thanks. - And you? - Yeah, sure. So, bon appétit! - Thank you. - Thanks! - I'll get you some, OK? - I might have fruit first. - Alright. - Thank you. You won't eat more? Yeah... I want to lose weight too. How do you know I want to lose weight? You've said so, haven't you? I'm saying it, but it doesn't matter now, but... whatever. It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Those are terrible sound effects. - Sorry, I'll eat it quickly. - I didn't mean it that way. I just don't have any appetite these days. Well, at least I'll lose weight. Even if I don't want to. - What? - Sorry. I'm used to talking to myself. It helps. - Sara, I'm so glad you're here. - Mum... I know, sorry. Have a banana. Alright, I will. Carbs are good for the nerves. Sorry. It might help. What? Yeah. You meant the bananas. Them too. Mum, don't cry. I'm not crying. - I can see you crying. - No, but... You have a tissue? There's nothing here. See, I'm totally in pieces. Aha... well... You're not working? She left her job. Yeah, I'm not working now. That's true. I see it here, yeah. That was some notice, by the boss, I'd say. But you'd been considering it long, so you don't mind. You weren't strong enough to do that, so somebody decided for you. - You were fired? - No, nobody fired me. But it wasn't any dream job. You're not sorry. More like... - It wasn't. - It certainly wasn't. No, it wasn't. But you've got rose-tinted glasses, about the future. That it's solved, done, you got rid of something unpleasant. But that's not true. It will eat at you. She's quite a difficult character, tends to be impulsive, almost aggressive. Mum, enough of the psychoanalysis. Thanks. You're financially OK for 5 months or so, but then you really should deal with it. There are options. But you don't want to see them. There's Five of Cups. You've got the strength. There's talent. She's really talented! There's inner energy, intelligence, strong rationality... That rationality might be blocking your true understanding, because you're following your brain, not your emotions, so you're just thinking, and thinking, weighing the options back and forth, but you're unable to truly decide what you want. Men... That's not really a topic now. I see here a Knight of Cups. But the guys, they come and go. The overthinking again: This one's good, this one isn't. Riffling through them: I like this one, I don't like that one, he's boring. There was one, he came and left. It was fast, but he left something. It's changed you inside. Pain? Mm... No, I'd say not. Something material. Something came out of it. Something you don't want. You don't like it, don't want to accept it. Or, you're considering what to do with it. The Moon here might be related to it. Female things, intuition, female topics. Here, together with Devil, it might be an unwanted pregnancy or... - You're pregnant? - I'm not pregnant. Well, but... the female things should be solved. I think the ancestral healing makes sense. - I don't get why you're laughing? - Mrs Zdena wasn't saying nice things. I'm not laughing. You should understand your feminine side. Accept yourself as a woman. Transform the girl to a woman. Realize who you are. A mother? Lover? Girlfriend? Grandma? All these topics will be going through your head now. Yeah. I'd pick one more card for this. Sure! Let's pick one. Try to focus on this topic we've just opened. That's your femininity. Focus on that. Now. Create a question within. Who am I as a woman? - Should I shuffle, and...? - Pick one. DEATH Are you ill? I'm dying and I forgot to tell you. - It's not physical death. - It's a transformation to a new level. You should focus on what you want and don't want in life. On that feminine level. You should listen to yourself. Or accept what is inside of you, and use it for the transformation. Change your status. Of your inner woman. Not any social status. It's about you. I think you know very well what this card is about. Do you know what the card is about? No. I'll go to the bathroom, OK? Yeah. You're completely free here. What time will you and mum have lunch? - Dunno... In an hour, maybe. - Alright. Don't worry about the ancestral healing. I've got only good experience with it. We even had to apply it in our family. Lenka wasn't doing well. Her mum was a mess. But there was a happy-end. I think we really don't need to drag my mum into this. We don't. Sorry... I just, as you said I should bring some photos of us, I didn't find any. We were mostly alone, so we took photos of each other. So we'll have to do it without this. Or we can take a photo here? - I need something, like, from the past. - But we'll manage, somehow. Why didn't you tell me you were fired? Cuz it seemed pointless. I wanted to quit anyway. They just did it first, is all. And what will you do? I don't know, mama. I've been thinking, well, dunno. I've checked out some courses. Dunno. Well, that's hard, then. Jesus, just a minor crisis, so what. I feel I studied in a wrong field, that I chose a wrong job. Dunno. - You've never had a crisis like this? - Not at work. - You're lucky, then. - I've made up for it in my personal life. - Hello. - Hello. And how about boys? Nothing. Nothing. I'm not seeing anyone. Well, you've said that, but... If you...could have some dream guy, so... - Like a prince or something? - No. Not a prince. A normal guy. So, what should he look like, be like? I guess I don't care what he'd look like. Just if he was nice and loved me. - Right, right. - And that's, as I've learned, quite hard. Tell me about it. That's why I'm worried about you. Oh, don't be. - You know, your clock is ticking. - Which clock? Like, biological? - Of course. - Jesus Christ. I mean, I'm glad that... That I didn't have a kid at twenty. I would be a total mess. Not at twenty, but first child at forty... Come on, I'm not forty. - I know you're not, but... - Before you find the right guy... Well, maybe let's not discuss it, mum. Maybe I'll find a girl. Sara! - You're not a lesbian. - No, I'm not, but it's a pity. I've just been thinking about it, I think it'd be pretty cool. I don't know. I think they've got it harder. But I guess I'd accept it. Well, since I get on better with girls, I think it'd be pretty good. Do you know what that death card means? Nah... dunno. But when she said it, you seemed to know. Well... The card scared me, alright. Like, you turn a card, and there's the word death, it's a bit scary, innit? Maybe let's not talk about it, mum. Neither you nor me understand tarot. So let's just leave it. First, I need to connect to your roots. Can you tell me something about your family, your ancestors? Well... In my family, from what I've heard and learned, there's never been a man you could respect. And I know that... The women suffered because of the men. Actually, I don't know any relationship in the history that was filled with love. Because the men... I hear just men, men, men. Tell me about the women. Mother, grandma. I'm talking about the women by talking about men, they made the women unhappy. And what were the women like? Grandma was great. Also unhappy in the relationship. She raised the kids... without getting any love. From what I know, there was even violence, but just once. And dad left my mum when I was little. I think it hit her terribly hard... And... she suffered. Then she was trying to find a partner with whom she'd be happy... But she always brought some asshole home. And in her pain... ...she didn't really notice my feelings, or what was making me sad. I'm scared I'm doing the same to Sara. What? That I'm occupied with my own pain and... And... it affects her. Can you remember any positive female example in your family? For whom it was different? That she had a happy relationship, love? Not really like that. I've always admired aunt Irena. Because she also didn't choose good men, well, she chose just one out of fear. Uncle is a terrible bastard, and she's still managed to find joy. I don't know how she's done it and how she does it. Maybe she focused on love to her kids. Which I'm kinda... bad at... As a girl, I wanted to be her daughter. Why did you want to be her daughter? Well, because my mum's relationship to me just didn't work. While auntie was a great mum, because she was able to handle all that. What about Sara's father? I met Béïa at a disco. Mine relationships before were kinda nice. Well... relationships, we were young, so... Just romance, but from what I know... those boys are really nice guys now. And great partners, apparently. And I broke up with them. With Béïa... I slept with him once and... I got pregnant. I really liked his attitude, then, he said he wanted the baby. And that we could be happy together. He said we'd get married after Sara's born, so that I can enjoy the wedding. That I'd be a pretty bride. That the dress would look good, without the belly. So he seemed like a pretty nice guy. We didn't know each other much, but... He said I seemed like a nice person too. But when Sara was born... He left. And he's never been interested in Sara. Do you know this story? We've never discussed dad with mum much. There's nothing much to discuss. From what I've heard, he's a scoundrel. Have you ever thought, in the darkest moments, that it might be Sara's fault? I don't think so. But choosing men, that's a curse in our family. In what way? Well, because... We always go for the selfish bastard. And generally... just bad guys. I keep hoping it will change. Pick one. And what do I do with it? Write what you want gone from your life. And may I write what I want to come to my life? When we want something to come, we must let go of something first. And now what? And now you burn it. Each inner act. A thought. Process. If it crosses the boundaries of universal love, it must be re-vibrated back to the original love vibration. You must cut it. Through an inner experience, painful. It will hurt. Yes. It must hurt. Healing yourself means healing future generations. But healing doesn't mean the wound stops existing. One mustn't pity themselves. Blaming others, men. You must get free, and that will free Sara too. Or do you want her to keep suffering? That's enough. That's enough. It's been fun till now, OK? I've had fun, alright, but now I'm getting sick of it. Can you tell me, you, as a reasonable, rational person, how you can believe that some charlatan, who just quotes some fucking bullshit from the net... Sara dear... ...will be telling you how to live? Like, for real, mum? This... this new age bullshit, really?! Please! Calm down, please! Please! Can you start thinking rationally? - Please! Mum, please! - Sara, calm down, please... - It's utter horseshit! Look where we are! - Do you see where we are? You see it?! I know, Sara, but... You know what, Sara? Leave, both of you. I'm done with such desperate cows too. - That... - Mum, we're leaving. Now. Let's go. - Wait. - We're leaving! Let's go home! - Jesus Christ! Wait! Jesus! - It can't end like this! I... I mean... It's not pointless we're here, Sara. Wait... Fuck you both then! I'd really love to trust you! But... Like, what you told Sara during the reading, I told you most of it on the phone. She picked the cards herself. Look how much inner strength you've just found within. The process hurts, it must hurt. Emotional outburst are completely normal. But of course, it's up to you if you want to continue. Hey, I'm sorry, but do you have any drink? I've got shrooms, if you want. The cards show you something... And the women follow it. Just... mesmerism, like. But you know how much it helps them? Those women come here, a fucking mess. And they leave feeling really better. Cuz they wanna live an illusion. And have you considered that, like... ... the way you're pissed off... ... is a part of the process? Of the whole healing? - Bullshit. - Right, you don't believe in that. I get that. I wouldn't believe it either. Well, I've got no choice. It's daily bread here. I mean... Here at the mill. Ya know, when grandma was still here with grandpa... Or, grandpa died soon, he drank and gambled... Well, granny was pissed off, so... She worked even harder. She always made some ointments and... People came to her, for advice... From the village, and from around too. She was kind of a healer or something. And Zdena kinda followed in her footsteps. And my mum ran as soon as she could, so... Oh, by the way... My dad wasn't functional either. Wait, you've got something there. Doesn't matter. Well, so I've been here for... wow... It's a really long time... I guess... Ten, twelve years... I'm really grateful to Zdena. I guess I've never been so grateful to anyone else. Where is your mother? I really love her. My mother's in Jihlava. Do you ever worry you'll end up like your mother? My granny used to say: "Nobody can stop you from loving everybody, but you must accept that they might not love you back. and that's the greatest freedom." Lenka? I guess I must go to mum. Well, get dressed then. They'll be by the tree by now. By the tree? It's really cold there. I'm leaving what doesn't belong to me. And I'm taking back what's mine. I'm leaving what doesn't belong to me. And I'm taking back what's mine. And what now? You know the intent. Now you can ask your ancestors and those who follow to help you implement it. You're not doing it just for yourself. And can I say it quietly? Can I hug you? Not me. Alright, alright. Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum! Mama! Mama! Mum, I'm so terribly sorry. I know I'm a hysterical cow. I'll work on that. I promise. I... are you angry with me? Please, don't be angry. I just don't want you to wallow in that fucking self-pity. I just wish so hard, mum... Please, just be happy. Be happy. Jesus, what's going on here? Mum. You've gone nuts. I know what it is. Mum, I think you should have some too. Because we're here together. So put it in my mouth. I'm so happy I'm here with you. I feel so safe. Everything makes sense. It's so simple. I... Don't know where to find the strength to give and... get nothing back. I wanna tell you something. You know hard it is to love someone who looks like somebody I hate? And you act the same too. You're not really helping me much. And are you influenced by commercials? - No way. - Not me. - No. - Not at all. - Hardly ever. - I am. I always give it a try. - Depends how it catches your attention. - It's interesting, yeah, isn't it. I'm influenced by the packaging. - Really? - Yeah, sometimes. But they tell you about it, if you don't know the product. Exactly. Or it will get lost. - Right. - As the lady said, yeah. So, let's move on to our product: "Elixir of Youth And Beauty" Do you like the packaging? - Well, it feels, like, kinda natural. - I guess I'd... I'd try it. Well, since it's organic cosmetics, I'd prefer the package without the bow. It looks kinda earthy. Reminds me of childhood, my granny. And I can see, like, a meadow in bloom. - I'm not into that natural stuff. - I wouldn't notice in the shelf. I like the tree there. Like, it kinda says it's close to the nature. Just seeing it here, I can't wait to see what's inside, so that I can say how I like it overall. If I went to a shop with natural cosmetics, I'd expect some natural packaging. So... - Maybe jute around! - Exactly, yeah! How do you feel about social media? Well, a proper dupe sometimes. I think it's a... time-waster. Yeah. I agree. I don't, ain't nobody got time for that. - No time for that, exactly! - Right! When I was a kid, we didn't have it, so looking up information fast is great. That is... Yeah, they're good for that. - But it's true you gotta be careful. - Yes. - It's dangerous. - It's dangerous. Maybe for, like, kids, not for us. It affects adults too, in politics and stuff. Of course, of course. And what do you consider most important in life? - Family. - Good health. - Life. - Good health. - You've got everything with good health. - Health, yeah. Family. That's nice: the most important thing in life is life. It's nice! - It's important. There's everything. - Health, luck, love, joy, sadness, all. - Everything, I guess. - And not everybody has that. I'd say kids are also a major part of that. Well, I mean, a family. And partnership? - That's hard. - Partnership? - Yes. - Like, a man and a woman, or? It can be another way, but... No, like, partners, kids, like your own kids? Love, simply. Well... That love is important for everything, but there must be also respect, and humility. - I've decided that... - Tolerance! I will be important for myself, because I always put myself last. One of that was that I put there also the value for others in my life... And with my partner, I tell him, when there's a crisis: "Choose. The easy or the hard way, but for life. For the family, visits, celebrations, walks, phone calls." So I've decided just... to have that love around me, and start with myself. Cuz I've realized it didn't work without self-love. - Exactly. - Yeah. That you've got nothing to give, right? After. - Exactly. Respect yourself. - Yes. - Where do I get love... - Right! If I don't have it! Luckily, it's never been like this for me. My man's a good guy. I'm not a feminist, mind you. The family hearth is major for me. Not that I'm some 1950s housewife... Waiting for my husband with a three-course dinner, no. Just, I'm glad I can snuggle somewhere, close the door and everyone can kiss my butt. Somewhere stable, with love, and you can discuss anything with your partner. The self-love is, like, given, in this nest. - There's one proverb, it says... - I hope I've got it right. That it's better to live with yourself than with an enemy. - Well, obviously, yeah. - Totally. - And that's... true. - Sure. Although all that talking of ours is almost making me cry. And why? - Well, it's because it is kinda... - Sensitive. A sensitive topic, and even if I'm happy, I'm sure each of us has some kind of, like, skeleton in the closet. And as we're talking, it's opening a bit. - Making it raw. - But we are not at psychologist's! It's not, we're just chatting, but... Thanks! - Goodbye. - Goodbye! - I liked it. - Me too.... A lot. It was nice. Right... I've got that focus group for you. Already? Thanks. Hey? I've got time tonight. Would you like to stop by? No. Great. Would you like to have a kid? Someday yeah, but not now. And you? Maybe... So... Would you like to go somewhere else? Or maybe... my place? You are very nice. But... No. It is okay? - Yeah, that's okay. That's okay. - Okay, okay, okay, so... - Thank you. - Bye. - It was nice to meet you. - Bye, bye. Oh, sorry. - This is my direction. - Okay, okay, bye. Bye. AND THEN THERE WAS LOVE...
