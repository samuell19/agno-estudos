[happy acoustic music] - Hey! [teapot whistling] - Hi, good morning! - Hey. - Ah, were they not awake yet? - They were too awake. - Oh, thanks. Have you seen my keys anywhere? - Uhh... There. - Oh no. - Wait! - Thanks a lot. Good luck, you can do it! - Hey Mom! - Oh! - There are more than 1,500 different species, and in the... In the... Group of amphibians. In Greek, the word "Amphi" means "Double," and "Bio means "Life." [kids shouting] - Don't forget your jacket! - [Kid] Hey! - Bye, my dear. Here. - Hey Sita! Do you want a ride? - No worries, I'll walk. Five toes, four fingers, and no nails. They live in ditches, lakes, and the rivers. - Ho ho! - Hey! Got a flat tire, Teach. - Oh, then you better jump on the back, otherwise you'll be late, and the teacher's gonna be grumpy. Jump on. Can't you go any faster? Come on! [kids cheering] Come on, guys! Hey, I marked your language test. You did a really great job. You know, I'll tell your mom about it tonight. - Tonight? Tonight? - Yeah, at the parent's meeting. Who's winning now? - [Sita] Come on, faster! - Woohoo, I'm first! Okay, you guys, pack away all your stuff. Sita, the class is all yours. Have fun. - I actually wanted to bring a real one with me. - Hang on a second, this says it's about a cat. Your presentation is about a cat. - Yeah, but I changed it to a frog. I like frogs better. My show and tell is about frogs. A frog is green, he has four legs and can jump very far. A frog lives in water, and on land. When frogs talk, they croak. [class murmuring] Teacher? Should I stop now or carry on? - You can go back inside. - Male frogs can croak really loud- - Okay, you can go and sit down again, Sita, thank you. Go and sit down. - Teacher, are you scared of frogs? [class giggling] - Silence, I don't want to hear another word! Get your geography books out. What is the capital of Latvia? Dennis? Ryon? Emory? - Riga! - Very good. Riga, very good. - That makes no sense at all! - [Sita] He was just in a bad mood, I guess. - But you put so much effort into it. - Please don't say anything about it tonight, okay? - Tonight? - Parents' night. - Yeah, yeah, I'll say something about it. - Mom... [phone ringing] Hello, this is Sita. It's for you. - Mmm? - Thomas. - Mmm. This is Cecile. Infected? And his temperature? Hmm. I'm on my way. Yeah, Spot's not doing so well. There's pus coming out of his paw. - Mom... - Ugh. Well, there's something in the fridge. - Mom, tonight at eight o' clock! - Yeah, I'll make it! No worries! [sighing] - [TV Chef] Let's see, and ladle... Spread the batter, cross the mold... Or you could use a piping bag, as well. Of course, it depends on the size of the mold, how much you put in. But what I like about a bundt cake, even if it's filled to the rim... - As you all know, our school has a birthday coming up. And not just any birthday, it's our 100th birthday, and we're gonna celebrate it with the lower grades on a boat. [parents murmuring] Yes, on a real version of Noah's Ark. All the children will be animals. Rabbits, cats, tigers, you name it! All animals are welcome. - Frogs as well? - Naturally, I could really use the help of the parents on the boat. Plus, an anniversary would not be a party without treats, and that's where you come in, I hope! - How about deviled eggs? - Oh, delicious! - Homemade Swedish meatballs? - For sure. - Apple cupcakes, I have a really good recipe for them. - I was thinking I- - My turn! - [Teacher] Sita? - Uhh... Bundt cake. My mother makes bundt cake. - That's great, homemade? With raisins, currants, and bits of apple? - And chocolate, and nuts. - Wonderful. There's nothing better than a homemade bundt cake. - Your turn. - Um... Cucumber. - Yes- - Slices. - Oh, yeah, delicious. - Cut, that is. - 100 years, and here we are traveling on a boat! Such a good idea, was this something that you thought of? It was something that I was really impressed by- - Please excuse me. Hey Sita, Sita! - My mother had to work. - Yes, I thought as much. But I want something else. Your animal. - Yeah? - Um, I said that all animals are welcome. But just not... - But why not? - Just because. - I'll still just be a frog. - Shh! - Yes, but why not? - Sita, are you coming? She's just a child out there in the dark. - Til tomorrow. Night, Sita. - That's an excellent excuse to do some traditional baking. - You coming? Hold tight now. - [Sita] Yep. - Can you ask your teacher what I missed at the meeting last night? - Not much. How's it going with Spot? - Very bad. He's not eating or drinking, he just lies around, sleeping. I don't know what to do anymore, I've tried everything. Hey, school already? - Yes, I have to walk. Got a flat. - I'll fix it for you. [kids playing] - I slept pretty badly last night. Because of... - Because of my frog? - Yeah. That's it. I have to tell you something. It's just that... Promise me you won't tell anyone else. - Mmm-mmm. - I'm a little different from other people. Mostly, I look like I do now. Just a normal teacher. But sometimes... I'm green. Slippery. Four legs. A thing. - You're a frog? You're joking, right? - No, it's not a joke. It's who I am. I don't go flaunting about. But I'm not ashamed of it, not at all. Do you know how far I can jump? Five meters with ease. And with the wind behind me, six! Some people think that someone like me can't be a good teacher, and that's why I don't tell anyone. You won't either, will you? - Mmm-mmm. - Sita, come on! Did you sleep well, teacher? - Just a few bad dreams. - Not about frogs, huh? - Shh! - What? - Good job, sit over here. There's still room over there. Squeeze past. - I'll make it a cat. - A cat? That's good, thank you. [applause] Woo! - Good morning everyone! It's a very important day for us at our school. I would like to introduce you to Mr. Stork! [applause] - It is my great pleasure to be here as our new principal. And I promise that I'll do everything in my power to make elementary school The Ark the best school in the whole country. - It already is! - Name. - Dennis. - Dennis... This will be the best school in the whole country, with children who never argue with their principal, but who politely keep their mouths shut when he's talking. We have an A, we have an R, we have a K. We have the best school of today. - Today? - We have an A, we have an R, we have a K. - Yeah. - [All] We have the best school of today! We have an A, we have an R, we have a K! We have the best school of today! We have an A, we have an R, we have a K! We have the best school of today! We have an A, we have an R, we have a K! We have the best school of today! - We are the Ark, and we're going for it! I'm looking forward to us working together. - Okay kids, one straight line! Switch! Let's see who can jump the farthest. You go first, Ed! Show us what you got! That wasn't bad at all. Okay, next one. - How far can you jump, teacher? Five meters. - Yeah, right. - With ease. - Mom! Mom! - Hey, sweetie. I'm nearly done. There, you okay? Yeah... - Mom? - Yeah? - Can a person also be a frog? - What do you mean? - That sometimes you're a frog, and sometimes you're not? - Yeah, of course. In fairy tales. - Do you know? If sometimes you can be a frog, and sometimes not? - Til tomorrow! Hey there! - Hey. - Hey Sita! - Shh! - Why are we tailing the teacher? Tell me! - No. Stay here. [doorbell ringing] - Come in! Oh, this is going to be fun! - What are you doing here? - Helping you. - Ugh! Teacher? - Coming? The teacher isn't here. - He is. Don't tell anyone else, you hear? I mean it! That's the teacher there. The teacher is a frog. - Yeah, right! - Can I help? - He needs guinea pig food. - Well, that's not in the display box. Come with me. Look, here's the guinea pig feed. One big bag? One or two? Are you sure you can carry that? - Nevermind. I don't have a guinea pig, and I don't like guinea pig food. There's no way the teacher's a frog. - Look at his eyes! Take a look. - That's gross. Those are the teacher's eyes! - That's why I told you. - Hello, teacher! - Hello! - Sita thinks that you're a- - Nice flowers, who are they for? - For... For a friend. I have to put them in water, I'll see you tomorrow. - So you thought that was the teacher? - Can you take him back to the shop? Bye! [sighing] - The teacher was just kidding, and you went and fell for it! - Well, so did you! - No way! - Yes way! - No way! - I found flowers by the back door yesterday. Red tulips. - And then he said he's a frog! [laughing, croaking] - It's a secret! - It's a joke! Or you shouldn't have told me either, right? - Lineups, please. Grades five, six, and seven, please. - It really is a joke. - No, no, it's definitely not a joke. Come on, try your best, eyes in front, everyone, how hard can it be to line up? Come on, now, get it together. - Why do we have to line up? - Just do it for me, alright? How's the gluing going here? It's becoming unglued a bit... [whispering] Just over there. Good job. [croaking] [croaking] [croaking] - Shh, stop it! [croaking] - You guys... Please. Stop it. [croaking] [class laughing] [croaking] - How do you do that trick, teacher? - Go teacher! Go teacher! [class laughing] - Teacher? - Mr. Franz, why aren't your students seated at their desks, and why aren't they as quiet as a mouse? And how did that frog get in the classroom? Well, how did that green, slippery- - That's Mr. Franz! His frog! - Mr. Franz. It's strictly prohibited to bring animals to school without the permission of the principal. Mr. Franz? Where is Mr. Franz? - Gone to the washroom. - Good. Then I will teach you something. The animal kingdom is rich in animals. Things such as birds, fish, bats, and also pigs. And out of all of these species, frogs are the lowest of the lowest. Simply because frogs are filthy, slimy, mudcrawlers. Who did that? Who did that? I'll deliver you from that disgusting squishy creature- [grunting] Where is that frog? Where's that filthy beast? - I don't know, Headmaster. - Without permission of the principal, not a single frog is allowed to leave the classroom. - Simon, are you okay? - Yes I am, Suzanna. I am very well. And you, are you okay? - Yes. - He needs to see a vet. - No, he needs a fairy. - A kiss, when you kiss a frog, it becomes human again. Not me! - My mom says I'm not allowed to kiss frogs. - Neither am I. - Dennis? - No! It's not your fault. - Franz... Why haven't you gone home yet? - We have detention. - Franz gave you detention? Then you must have behaved very badly. Why is it so messy in here? Where's your teacher? - In the washroom. - You can go. I'll wait for him here. Come on, outside, all of you. This has never happened to me, kids who don't want to go home! Go, get out! Hello, hello? You too, Sita. Mr. Franz and I are going inline skating this afternoon. I think he'll be here soon. - I don't think so. - See you tomorrow. - Mom! - Hey, what's wrong with you? Hey, come on, eat something! Have fun at school? - Mom, what do frogs actually eat? - Oh, frogs eat flies, mosquitoes, ants, spiders, snails... Basically anything that's small and moves. - And what if that's not available? - Oh, it always is, one fly is already a big bite for a frog, and nature is always full of flies. - And what if the frog isn't in nature? - Then it'll die. - Mom, you stay here with Spot tonight. I'll be fine. - Everyone, go for a pee, wash up, and get to the table! - Pass me that jar over there. Thank you. Careful! Yes! - Yeah! - Wouter, go for a pee, wash up, and sit down. Are you staying for dinner? - Well, uh... - You're welcome. Come on, I made too much anyway. We're having meatballs, and I'm sure you'll like them. [kids playing] - Settle down, guys, settle down now. - You have to go home. - Right, I have to go home. - No, dessert still! I made pudding with berries from the garden. - Thank you for dinner. - Come again sometime. - I'll walk you home. - No, it's your turn to wash up. - No, it's Sam's turn! - [Mother] No, sit down and finish eating! - Bye! - [Mother] Bye, sweetie! - Coming? - Now? - Yeah. Wouter, come on! Wouter! [giggling] - I'll be on the lookout, okay? But get moving! - Yep. Teacher? Look here! - Hi. - Yeah, come on! Bon appetit! - Is he still alive? - I think he's enjoying his snack. [bell ringing] - So, where's your teacher? Having a pee again? - Good morning everyone! Mr. Stork, as we agreed on, my class is going to prepare for the anniversary today. Okay, come on now, here we go, guys. Okay guys, start forming a line. - How do you do that trick, teacher? - What? - Turn into a frog! - I want to learn it too! - Okay, calm down. I'll explain everything later, okay? - [Kid] But sir- - Who's the first to get to the curve? [kids cheering] Okay guys, turn right! We're going over there. That was a delicious fly, thanks very much. Look, it comes naturally to me. I discovered it when I was about four years old. Since then, whenever I think strongly of that thing, I- - A frog? - Yes. Like yesterday. Then, and then... I get this thing in my head, and it becomes bigger and bigger, until I am one. - Can I do it too? - No, no, it's hereditary. My dad had it. My grandpa, my grandpa's father, and my grandpa's grandpa had it. It happened to all of them from time to time. - How do you become human again? - Good question. When I want to become human again, I first have to eat an insect. - From now on, I'll always take a fly to school. A fly for emergencies. - Yeah. - Mr. Franz, would you rather be a teacher, or a you-know-what. - The life of a thing has lots of benefits. You can jump, and croak. [laughing] But it's dangerous as well. You always have to watch out. You could be eaten just like that. - Who by? - By a stork. Big storks eat... Us. Come on, let's get down to work. I promised Ms. Suzanne a real Noah's Ark. - Murderer. - What did you say? Murderer? - He eats frogs. - Sure. Storks eat frogs, and frogs eat flies, and people often eat cows. It's nature. - Storks should leave frogs alone. - What's all this with you and frogs lately? [playing "Fuür Elise"] - Boogie woogie! [playing ragtime music] Suzanne! Suzanne, I'm sorry about the inline skating. - Sita, the teacher has a crush on Ms. Suzanne! - No way. - I wasn't myself, I didn't feel terribly well. I looked all green around the gills. - Oh, that's awful! And now? - Oh, completely gone. - That's good! Do you have plans for tonight? - No, none. - Want to go out for dinner with me? I know a great restaurant! It's called La Grenouille. - La Grenouille? - Yes, that's French. Franz. [laughing] - My, French, isn't that good. - La Grenouille means "The Frog." Don't you like frog legs? Franz? [croaking] - Teacher? [knocking on door] - [Suzanne] Franz? [knocking on door] - Shh! - Hi. - Wouter... Where is Mr. Franz? - Inside. - Is he sick again? - No, he just needed to pee badly. - I see, yes. - Sita! - Get your fly. - Okay. Ta-da! - Yeah, great. - Where do you think you're going? Running in the hallway. This is not the first time you're bending the rules, Sita. [croaking] Are you trying to be funny? - She's got hiccups. [hiccuping] - What are you hiding there? Well? [knocking on door] - Simon... Are you busy? - No. - I'm afraid something's wrong with Franz. He's in the washroom, and I knocked, but... - Again? Franz must think that washroom belongs to him. - He might be stuck in the toilet bowl. - Stuck in the toilet bowl. I'm writing it down right away. Franz has to be careful. - Careful of what? - Ugh, careful! - Sorry, Teacher! - He's got one. - Yes! Look how fat it is! - Look, a fly! - He doesn't see it. - Yes he does, hold on! Get it, Teacher! Come on! Get it, Teacher! Come on! - I feel sorry for the fly. - I feel more sorry for the teacher. [sheep baaing] - Hi, Fritzi! Are you all by yourself? It's hot, right? Yeah, it's hot. Huh. - You're home early. - I'm just here for a minute, I'm going to fix your tire. Hello, Wouter. - Hi. - As far as I know, there's a box with a bicycle repair kit in there. [glass shattering] - Hello, ma'am. - Hello. - How wonderful you're baking a bundt cake! - Uh, me? - Yeah, for the anniversary, right? - Here's the bicycle stuff, but I have to disappoint you. The glue's all used up. See you tomorrow. - What's your teacher doing here? - Oh, house call. - In the shed? - Bye! - Do we have any tire glue around here? - Tire glue? - Sorry, I thought you were someone else over there. - No, I'm myself. I'm Simon Stork, principal of the Primary School of the Ark. - Oh, it's good that we get the chance to talk! Since when do you do shed calls? - Shed calls? - Yes, Mr. Franz, he was in my shed this afternoon. - Ah, Mr. Franz again, of course. [kids playing] - Boys, please calm down! Boys, be quiet! Do you always listen to your mom that well too? Do you know the secret for a good bundt cake? Eggs at room temperature. With cold eggs, you ruin everything! - Sita disobedient? What has she done wrong? - What hasn't she done? Running in the hallway, making strange sounds, getting up when she has to sit, sitting when she has to get up. She recently let a slimy frog escape from the classroom. - Yes, yes, she's been into frogs quite a lot lately. She's her mother's child in that regard. Always concerned for animals. And frogs belong outside, don't you agree? - I do agree... But this frog was meant for educational purposes, and at our school, rules are rules. - Rules are just rules, and I'm sure that Sita means well. [clicking tongue] Hey. - For you. - Oh, that's sweet, but I sorted it all out. This is for your teacher. - But you have to bake one yourself! - I'll be glad when these potatoes work out. Hey! Hey! - Look how gross it is! - Sita! - [Sita] No! [adventurous acoustic music] - Where are you going? - Look there, that's Mr. Franz's bike! - Hey guys! - Teacher, are you okay? - Yes. - Mr. Franz. No Mr. Franz. - He went for a pee, Headmaster. - Ah, a pee. - I went out last night for an evening with some friends. An evening of croaking and jumping and so on, like we often do. And suddenly, there was a stork in the ditch. A huge animal with cold eyes of a murderer. He gobbled up two of my green friends. And then he grabbed me. Snap! My life flashed before my eyes. - But- - Then I got lucky. A barking dog ran up to us. The stork was startled, and dropped me. I fell in the ditch and sank to the bottom, where I spent all night without making a move. Dug down into the mud. - I can smell that, Teacher. - Sorry, guys. Something went wrong. - Sita. - Forgot my gym clothes. [class giggling] - Exactly my size. And I love the color. - Look who's here. Smelling like a wet dog, late arrival in inappropriate clothing. We're nearly there, Franz. - I thought, "Really, how hard can it be?" Normally you just follow the recipe, and if you help me... Oh! You go ahead, I'll tidy up here first and follow in after. Get everything ready! - [Both] Bye! - See you! Hey... Hey little one, tell me what's wrong. Are you lonely? Yes, I have to go home now. Hey... What's worrying you? [kids cheering] - We're gonna make it all pretty with a cone. Now, a cone is nothing other than a piping bag made out of parchment. I try to get it all covered in chocolate. - Sita? Sita? [surprised yell] Ugh! - Oh, my pretty girl, did I frighten you? I'm sorry. - Look! I'm almost ready. You just need to pump the tires, and you can take it for a spin. And I got you a raisin bun to have at recess. - Hi! - Hey, Sita. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - Picking you up. - Oh? - Now you don't have to be scared anymore. Of a stork, anyway. Ta-da! - Ha. You are my guardian angel. How's the bundt cake coming along? - A disaster. - Oh. - My mother had to work. - Mr. Stork. Yesterday you said "We're nearly there." Well, I've been wondering... Where are we nearly? - We're almost where we should be, Franz. We're almost done with one another. Just one more misstep, and the school board will fire you. - Franz, how are you doing? - I'm doing it all wrong. - No! You're a great teacher! - My days are numbered at The Ark. - Hey. Stop that. What'll I do without you? - Boys, girls, when a teacher makes a lot of mistakes, then the school board can fire him. And, well, you know me, I'm not perfect. - You are! - Yes, well, that's where you and Mr. Stork don't agree with one another. You see, everything I do wrong, he writes down. Just one more notation, and then... Then you'll be getting a new teacher. Hey! Shhh! If Stork hears you, I'll be fired today! Listen, I really want to stay with you guys. But that will only happen if I don't mess up anymore, I mean, not even once. Just one more notation, and I won't even be here for the celebration. Can you all please help me with this? - Yeah, got it! [phone ringing] - The Ark Elementary School. Yes, you're speaking with Simon Stork. Indeed, I did phone you. It concerns one of our employees, Mr. Franz. A rotten apple in the fruit basket of The Ark. Totally incompetent for the job. Dismissal with immediate effect. Well, of course, I don't like it either. Arriving late for work, getting stuck in the toilet bowl, muddy hair, weird outfits, smelling, just to name a few things. And I've kept a detailed record of all of this. - Teacher! [playing "Heart and Soul"] Teacher! - Sorry, Suzanne, just a second. - Teacher! - Sita, not now! - But, Teacher! - First thing tomorrow morning, okay? - But Teacher, there was a stork at school! - Tomorrow. Sita, go home. - But- - As long as I'm not a thing, I have nothing to worry about. Storks aren't dangerous for teachers. See you tomorrow. [croaking] - Frog legs, frog eyes, frog mouth, frog feet! Does a frog have a tail? - Don't do this, stop, stop it! Otherwise I'll turn into a- - A frog? Frogs are nice! [croaking] A big fat frog. - I must not think about this, I must not think about this! - Frog! - Franz? Franz? - We're home. Stay, okay? What are you doing here? - Hey! Well, I've got currants, nuts, raisins, and chocolates. I'm making a bundt cake for the first time in my life. There. I've already greased the cake tin, what's next? - Uh... Put the butter and sugar in the bowl. - Okay, butter... Sugar... - Mix until it's soft and creamy. - Yeah? - I have to do my homework. - Oh. - Come here, Teacher. Look, here's a desk. Or would you rather be on the balcony? You're allowed to. - Sita! It's ready to go in the oven. Want to lick it? - No. - How's the homework going? [croaking] [laughing] See you. - Don't croak in front of my mom! Look, I have a piano. Do you want to play the piano? [kids playing] - Hi! - Hey, don't touch! Hi. - Enough! And now everyone to their cages, or it's off to bed without dinner! You understand bundt cakes. Right? - Yes. - Are you feeling hot? Want to go swimming? - Let's see... Now it's almost looking good. You see? - Delicious! - Doing okay? - Yeah! - Now I can tell you hold the mixer still, that's good. Hey Sita. - Hey! What are you doing? - Oh, it's for school. - Hang out here with us, forget about your homework for once. - Wouter forgets his homework. - Would you like a kringle, they're so warm! - First my homework. - Hey! How do you do that? "First my homework?" Do you put something in her food? - Teacher, dive right in! - You went too far this time. - What are you doing? I can hide a frog, but not a teacher! - You kidnapped me! That was completely out of line! - There was a stork. - So then the most dangerous thing you could have done is turn me into a frog? You of all people should know that! Listen, what you did was wrong. When I'm like that, as a frog, I am completely defenseless. You get that, surely. Don't ever do this again. Okay, is it a deal? Yeah, well, I need to get out of here. There's someone waiting for me. - Sita! - Good evening. I, uh, I'm here to check on the baking. Do you mind? - Uh, sure... - Wow. - This is the bundt cake. - Excellent. - And the cupcakes. - Yeah. Truly outstanding. Delicious. Wow. Extremely delicious. - A cookie? - These are shortbread? Great! Now that is really quite exceptional. Ladies, your baking belongs among the best of the best. - What about a kringle, maybe? - I have to move on, unfortunately. But I've seen enough! - A gem, that's what he is. - Thank you. Thank you so much. Hey! Look, the bundt cake. Your teacher was here. To sample the treats. - The teacher is a frog. [laughing] He really is a frog. - Sita... You're too big now for these kind of fairy tales. - But Mom, he really is one! - He sure likes his food, and he seems to know how to enjoy himself. He thought this was excellent. Here, have one. It's going to be a lot of fun tomorrow. I'm sure of it. Good morning, wakey-wakey! We've got a busy day ahead of us. Chop chop. - Mom... I feel sick. - What's wrong then? Tummy ache, headache, sore throat? - Everything hurts. - Hmm. Well, um... I'll make you all better with an aspirin. - Miserable. - But sweetie, you'll miss the anniversary! Well... You know what, I'll quickly take everything over to your teacher. When I get back, I'll make you some toast. Keep warm now! I'll be right back! [mischievous music] - Cecile! Hi! Hi! - Oh, hi! - I was wondering where you've got to. Is everything okay? [clicking tongue] - Ah, fantastic. Wow, great, put them down over there. Where's Sita? - Yeah, uh, she's at home sick. - Home sick? - Aw, what a shame! - Yeah, she was really looking forward to this. - I missed you. [clicking tongue] - I'm so happy that Sita goes to a good school. - Right. - Have you seen Simon? He's not here, and he's not at school. I find it strange. - I find it peaceful. - That little chick of mine seems tough... But she has way too much imagination. - Yeah. - She thinks, for example, that you're really a frog! She's a real frog crazy child, like, frogs this, frogs that, she wakes up with frogs and goes to bed with frogs. She used to be a cat child before that, but that's all changed now! Now it's frogs here and frogs there. [croaking] Are you feeling okay? You're looking a little... I'll go and get you a glass of water. - Oh no, not now! No, I have to give a speech at the anniversary! - Franz! Are you feeling sick again? [croaking] - Where's Mr. Franz? [laughing] - Where's the teacher? Where's the teacher? - Inside. - Teacher? - Sita! You should be in your bed! - Where's the teacher? Teacher, come here! Come here, Teacher! Where's your fly? [cawing] [kids screaming] - Easy, easy, kids, don't panic. Don't panic, don't panic! Everything will be fine! - That animal's dangerous! Get it outside! Open those doors! - Hey, no no no no! Don't do that! You'll just frighten him more! - He has to go! Mom, he wants to eat the teacher! - Shh. Take it easy. Take it easy. - Where's Mr. Franz? Find Mr. Franz, come on! - Sita, stop this nonsense! Not the time for your wild imaginations! - Let me go! [croaking] - Come, hurry! Everyone! Shut the door! Sita, come! Here! - There, there, boy. Easy now, okay? Everything's going to be fine, and I know a lovely lady who's going to be very happy to see you. And then you won't be lonely anymore. - And you'll be in a cage for the rest of your life. - There. I don't think for the rest of his life, because soon as the female is better, I'll release the two of them together. - Shh. Shh. Everything's going to be fine. - Look, I found a fly. - Kids, leave that poor frog alone- [kids gasping] - Kids... How... What... [laughing] What time is it? We need to get moving, Mr. Stork will be here in a minute! - Teacher, Stork won't be coming here ever again.
