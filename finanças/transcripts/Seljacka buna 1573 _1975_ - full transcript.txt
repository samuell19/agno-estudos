Anno Domini 1573., arose the peasants of Croatia and Slovenia against their lords, but they slash them, kill them and to obedience in towns bring them. These are the records left in the hearts of the beaten. Peasant's Revolt 1573. They are going to this forest. Peter, help! Help, Peter! Halt! Stop breaking the net! Halt! Strip those rags off you! Father! Will you strip and don't talk back! Dad! What are you waiting!? You want me to kill you!? Have mercy! I'm a poor man! I have hungry children at home. Give that out! There, take it! Why did you stop? Aren't you stripping? What will you do to my dad? Farewell my son. Take this from your father to eternal memory. Run! Did you hear!? We got one noble lord. I knew we'll got him at an old beech. There, sniff! What are you planing illustrissime Tahy? What what am I planning? Do I have a right of sword on my land, as an earthly lord? Or I maybe don't? You do, of course You do. But you promissed us hunting a boar. Ehh.. this will be the real hunt. It will pass some time.. ..until we find him in this fog. Gabrek! I'm here. Why are you stiffed? Blow that horn! Shall the Andraž let him run, and in five minutes we will release the dogs. Now you will see the real lungs! In the name of the holy, indivisible trinity. Father and Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen. Our only Fahter, One in personality and triple in Trinity. Go! Go some son, I told you nicely. Or the lords will chase you like the beast too. Let go! Let go! Krašovec, Ivan humbly gives the bag of barley, bucket of eggs, Two hens, and a rooster. What? Take his knife, Vid. Give me the knife Petey. Give your uncle the knife, Petey. No. I'll need it to go to forest. Give the knife. Someone filled your head with foolish thoughts. Done! Drive! Wait! There are virgins! Let's go! Go Barbie. So people don't wait. Go girls! Joyfully! You can't go so sour in front of the lords. At least they'll properly wash in the court. What do you think guys? If only we could be the noble skinned this night. Praised be the name of Holy Jesus. And Holy Virgin Mary's Since the king Matthias [Corvinus] sleeps there's no justice in this world. And when will the king Mathias awake? Nobody knows that, my child. When he and his oathed army awakes, it will be the end and cease of everything. When the 1000 year old kingdom of heaven will arrive on earth and all people will be equal as they are equally borned. Leave my knife, I'm not giving it to you. You won't while I'm alive. Don't Vid, Petey will obey you sometime. No! My dad was shot like a rabbit and you're silent. I knew what was cooking in your head. For my father, I will slash knife to someone's throat. Look what will your mutiny do! Holy Mary! They will remove white from your eyes and skin you alive, like they did to me! That's how all our mutinies will end, 'till the end of time. Give us our everyday bread... For help with Mother of God.. a hand please, a hand and a horse.. one more horse... We shall put the red rooster on their roof! Petey. Calm yourself people. Nobody will harm you. Kupinić, you there? I'm here Pasanec. Halt, stay calm or I'll slay you with a knife. Petey, come to me. Peace is on the other world people, but heaven shall be seeked in this life. Your lords are great because you kneel before them. Where are you from? Listen to him. But time is coming when the accounts shall be made. We are men of Oathed Brotherhood who for justice and equality among people want to fight. Our ambasadors went to the Kaiser himself to seek protection from him, if there will be no help. We shall no wept, but took arms in our hands Praised be Jesus. It's the king Matthias himself, with his oathed army. They sentenced us to death and they want us locked in chains, but we sentenced them too! That's right! He speaks right. People! Wait for the omen that shall came! There will be struggle! Peasant's struggle! The omen.. blood.. cross.. You lead people to doom! You will slay everyone! Cursed you!! Time is coming when the accounts will be made. The Oathed Brotherhood is preparing our peasant's struggle. You will see it soon. Why are you telling this to me Petey? I'm fine as I am. Give her peace Petey, it will pass her. Stubičanci had the red rooster symbol near the church. I didn't tell you that. Maybe our dad was in Oathed Brotherhood too. Our dad was a poor man, that why noble dogs ripped him apart. Don't be such, sister Barbie. All our accounts with the nobles will be smoothed. You'll see. The omen will came and we will all arise for justice. What is that? Silencium, please! After all, we arrived. They won't mind for waiting us so long, I beg your pardon. As we faced a great menace on our way here. Turn it, turn it now. They searched us, so we couldn't go forth. We were in such rush that I got upside down. But now in a flash, I'll be on the right side. I'm here. Safe and sound. Move you fool, what are you starring at? The story I tell you how a Petrica Kerempuh, the world vagabound walking empty hands and stomach from bishop of Zagreb screwed our noble lord. And so, my beloved, was I returning from the fair, but one, one... ..well yes, the royal fair. And ask me our noble lord. So, how was the fair, Petrica? Well, I didn't tasted him my lord. Mhmm... were there many people? I wasn't counting them. Listen you.. I will teach you how to talk to a lord! Would you good people give us some goods? ...give us.. I wasn't eating nor drinking for three days. Give us.. give us good people.. You'll get a rooster, my lord! A rooster!! For a tasty rooster, there's tasty music. Hey Petey! What do you want? Don't be sulk. I'm a bit.. you know.. wacked.. Let me watch. And so.. noble lord tells me: A develish is mother of yours..you're screwing me? A noble lord? Špan, where are you? I'm here my lord. Send him to dungeon immedeiatly Let him remember the noble justice till the final moment of his life. Lie down here.. you get 25 smacks on your ass!! Don't hit me mister Špan! To hell he won't. But I was thinking how to bail out. And so I see the pipe on the barrel. Ayy.. I like so much my lord's drink. Way to go. You just hold her so the vine won't pour out Soldiers! Soldiers are going! Run! Move that thing. There, on the hill. Look, someone's following us. Who would be so crazy to go after us. I can't go further. Wait me to catch my breath. Father and uncle wanted me to be a bishop. And look at me now. If you don't like it let it go. Couldn't I stay with the soldiers too? I would have everything. You're always ruthless and cruel to me. Stop whining Bucko. We'll make you a bishop on top of the hill. Just make sure to carry the weight of your cross. Look! What do you seek here? I seek the Oathed Brotherhood. Perhaps you can tell me something. What is the brotherhood you seek? He went after me. He couldn't take his eyes of me. I wasn't going after you. I want to fight for justice and equality among the people. A freeman from Stubica said that peasant's struggle is approaching. But I see you can't help me. Leave him. We need to reach the top. Wait, now I understand you. We'll get you to your Oathed Brotherhood. Come with us. For real? The most real. You have luck, you came to the right place. That's rght, that's right. But if you want to go with us, help us drag this thing. Here's the lever. Is it far away where you're going? It's right here, on one of the hills. Go, push it like a big boy. I wish you a good day, good people. I see you reached your top. Praised be God. Boy, did we strayed to the nice place. Now that we're here, we can't go back. Shu chickens, shu, shu!!! Wait, wait!! You left me behind! Stop! We're poor people, we don't have anything. You can't get loot here. Shut up and go forth. Where? Don't ask but go! They probably stumbled accidently here. What do you think? Did Tahy sent them here? Mum.. silent.. Seen it? Can we pass? Two forints. Two? You rub our skin worse than Tahy. Two. One now. And second after work is done. Which way? It's all soaked, and down on pass there are six soldiers. Through them. I go first and you after me. Do you have another sword. We can go. No, we made a deal with him. Fine, I'll do it alone. I want to go with him. Give me a sword and a horse. Who is he? He's not ours. Some comedian. Thank you comedian. I'll do this comedy alone. Petey. Are you going to Trgovišće? Me? I'm going. Check this out. Tomorrow you'll get the other one. As soon as I hit it, you go after me. I'm confused. Are we cought by bandits? Leave me alone. To arms! Bandits! You Gregorić! My master will impale you! He will when he caughts me! I'm going after them. Thank you people for everything. Where are you going? Petey! Needels! Needels, needels! Pants! Pants! If I tell you when I bought it, you'll see I won't fraud you. Out of pure love. I'm not interested you got underpaid. If it will be cheaper, I'll buy it. Seven for all five. No No. Ten! Seven! Ten Seven! Seven! Teeen! Ecco, here's the real Italian silk. Traveled for five years on caravels and caravans. You look like a real lord baron. Andraž, bring the old surka that I gave to the pig holder last year. It shall be just the one for that peasant. Don't tease them noble lord. They are here stronger that us. Be calm noble lord, be calm. Wonderful son does Tahy have. Who??? Who's stronger!?!?!? He's here. How can we recognize him? Everyone talks about him different. He needs secrecy. You have to be the main man by something. Is the "beg" here? We're all here. You are most welcome Nikola. Come. Where are you rushing!!! Go away! Or I'll smack you so hard you'll forget you walked bare feeted on this land. Who are you? Are you noble blooded? Why do you need that? If you're not noble blooded you don't have the privilege to wear the beard and mustache, Pick up what you thrown down. Don't be angry at our young lord. He drank too much. Halt! I told him to pick up! Want to steal something? What you have there? Who did you stole that to? Let me go. I am no thief. You aren't for you can't If you can, then you are. Let me see that! Go away, that's mine! Give me! No, that's not your business! What is it there waiter?! Real Italian silk, it went for 5 years on caravels and caravans. Did my squire done something bad to you? Your squire? You're in a fishy business Gregorić? I'm in no business, He's in my service form yesterday. 'Got something against? What would I have? If that's so, I'm fine. Were you in trouble comedian? Where are your friends? I'm no comedian. I just happened to be with them. Don't get angry instantly. Where's that woman of wonderful beauty who was with you? Don't know. I have my path, they have their. Pitty. I wanted to find her. Aren't you coming with me? Sure, how not. To squire! To squire! Then wear a sword like a real man. What sword? The one in your hand. I saw you from top of the hill. You had it from the ole blacksmith. I shall teach you how to use it. If you don't learn it. You 're just like the dead Aren't you in "The Oathed Brotherhood" which plots the war against our nobles? Don't you ever talk to me about that! I won't Yes. Salam ! Salam Aleikum! You babble Turkish? I was in Istambul. As a merchant? As a serf. I escaped as you see. And where are we on this scrap? Here is Sava... and here is Susedgrad.. and we are on the crossroads.. And how long there is from here to the sea? Sea is on the other map. What is a sea? Sea is the biggest water of all.. Who once sees him, never forgets it. There, you asked for the sea.. I'd prefer a boat. Some men want to talk to you Gregorić. What men? They'll tell you themselves. Say where should they look for you? Down on the water. Near blacksmith Vukovački. Down there. What are you saying? I don't understand a word. How can't you understand? Master wants you to pose him. He shall name his piece - The Knight And His Squire. If you follow the main road, you'll reach the river in half an hour. The blacksmith is there. You listening to me? I'm listening. Why are you telling me this? Two brothers, blacksmiths are there. They shall tell you the news about me. You' re going? I'm not. They'll take me away. Why don't you run? I can't it's too many of them. They would slay me immediatly. Be calm. I'll flee once he finishes. Are you done there? He says, one more move. I'm not in a hurry. But the nobles are.. No blood please!! Say hello to that pretty comedian if you see her! I'm sorry I haven't found her. The most magnificent magician of all will do his new hocus-pocus He shall do what noone in the world can! He shall fly like a bird from top of a crurch tower. and will reach the very top of the sky! Oh pitty me, he would rather fly like a bird then look after his wife. What comedy are you planing? He will do it whatever may happen. You're serious? I am, I am I'm not sure he will fly with those wings. Silencium, please!!! Why are you letting him die? Dear men and women, and entire respected muncipality! I'm kindly asking you to hear me out! From the very birth of mine, I knew what lewd I am and a fool. But now I am convinced that I'm not alone in the world. And that there's even more lewdish and foolish. I'm clearly not a goose! Nor chicken, nor a sparrow to fly from a tower. We screwed you, and pulled your nose, and you gave us money for that. There, take this!! Run! Let me go! There he is! He was among them! Catch him! Such fools can rarely be found. Why are you spitting me? Don't you feel pitty for the clothes? You're a decievers and a thiefs! So, now you don't like us!? And I was the one who thought you'll stay with us. I would rather kill myself then become a comedian. I want to be a human. And aren't we humans too? Let me see how much we got? Where are you coming from? From far away. Who are you? We are marauders. We scavenge arms after the battles and live from that. And why are you here? There was no war here? There was not. But it will be. We follow the trails of the soldiers. For Christ's sake horses hair falls down all by itself. It's amazing how much mouses there is in the fields. They destroyed everything. By day you can see the stars and by the night the bloody moon. Wolves are running around the houses. They howl and want to grab innocent children through closed doors. Last week, some man caught a fish with the human head from this river. Said it whispered: Death! Death! Death! Those are all weird signs, drawn by some mighty hand. He'll escape. Fear not. They don't call him "The Runner" for nothing. He escaped the Turks from serfhood twice. I belive he'll escape too. Where are you bringing these from? From somwhere up north, from Moravia. They rebelled there. It is not good! Not good! Wine is becoming a vinegar. Yeah, yeah.. There he is! What did I tell you. That's got to be him. It's futile Gregorić!! You won't escape! He's running to the bushes! He's off to the bushes! Chase him! They caught him again. You seen it? I didn't but he's down from his horse. They won't get him so easialy. There he is. That one's done too. Get the second and the third. The fishes will die. Horseshoe's twenty coins, right? Deal. You're modifying schyts? You could hang for that. Who can see what I'm doing here? You're right. I saw nothing. I'm afraid he could not escape. Some men supossed to meet him here. What men? I don't know. If you want to talk, go inside talk to my djetić. I don't have time for this. Blackshith said that his djetić is here. He's making fun out of me. I didn't finished all my exams yet. Wait. When I finish it.. Check this out. Noone ever done such a piece. It's almost done. Only some details need to be done here. Are you working on it for a long time? What's that a long time? Everyone's thinking only about time. Everyone's in a hurry somewhere. Master! Anyone alive here? I am here! The squire! Long live my squire! Where's the blacksmith? I'm in a hurry. I can't lose my food on a men like you. Greetings smith! You have a sword? I do. For a man with a money. Can I owe you? No. If they kill you, who'll return your debt? Then I have no choice... but to save my head. If we'd follow this river, we would reach the sea. This river goes to the sea? All rivers go to some sea. They didn't seek for you at a blacksmith's. I checked it out. I don't have time to wait for anyone. Even you. If you can keep up, do so. I can. It's not hard. I'll leave you behind. You go. I'm not going. Want us to go slower? They killed my dad like a beast. And chased him by angry dogs. Stripped him naked. I'll never forget how dogs torn.. all parts of his body. and you're taking me to some sea?! Come on. Don't cry. See.. the great war shall come here.. People go to seceret meetings, make arrangements. And I, like I don't exist. Noone needs me. They want to see you. And where are they? When they need me to get rid of the guards, they find me right away. And look. Where can one find such a hand? Look someone's in the fog. Do not do attack, I'm a friend. You're Gregorić? They still write me so.. Some men want to see you. I know. Who is he? My squire. Fine, my job is to get you there, and they'll decide the rest. Go here. There he is. They're waiting for you inside. He should stay here. No, he's with me. Is he armed? No, just like I. Let's go inside. Hello Gregorić. Do you know me? I know you. Stay here. There's a lot of men you know here. I see. Who am I suposse to talk to? We talk about you for a long time Gregorić, you are... I know who I am. But I don't know who you are. We are the supreme command of the rebellion. We're preparing a war against the nobles. What do you want from me? You'll command the peasant army. Have you seen the guys outside? They need to be taught how to fight the noble's army. And who shall command me? Us. Supreme coucil. And who's supreme among you? We can't tell you that. Until you oath. Wait Nikola. We must tell him. I am. They named me supreme. When did you planned to start? The deal is - as soon as the first snow falls. That's good. Way to go. Nobles don't like to ramble around during winter. And peasant is then furious. The night's are long so he can think about his miserable life. How much soldiers will you have? Entire Croatia, Styria and Carniola. Our men are all around and they are only waiting for a cock's feather to rebel. And all will join? They will. People wan't to live like humans. And then? When nobles will be no more? We want for all men to be equal. The same... as they were borned.. The new world is about to come Gregorić What else do you want to know? When will I oath? Make a circle. What should I write to Kaiser, beg? Nothing, stall like he does. There's no use of talking to him. He said that justice is on our side. And that's why we'll trust only ourselves. God be praised Petrek Čekolov Forever neighbour Martin. Are we far away from home? Far away neighbour Maritn. You joined the service at Gregorić's? Right. Tell my mom not to be angry at me. Will do. You'll stand in circle with your right foot and you'l put your hand on your heart. We don't oath out loud, but in ourselves. They call you The Runner? I escaped the Turks twice. But you can't escape from this circle. I already thinked about everything. Let's go inside. Blacksmith, hey blacksmith? I there anyone alive there? Hey people!! Aren't you cold? Of course it is. Waiting for someone? Yes, we're preparing a war against nobles. So I heard. Boy it is cold We're only waiting for a snow. It should have fall already. Those aren't the people you wait . Know where these people are going? Where? To hot water to warm themselves. Will you ever get smart? What are you yapping again? You're yapping. You have the warm water down there. Like from the boiling pot. You get inside and you feel warm. I wanted to invite you to go with me. Why aren't you going with them? They don't want to. They're afraid.... Why? They say it's a devilish work of some witches or unpure forces. Well, are they? They might are, might aren't. But poor man can't choose much. Want to go? Can't. I have to wait here. I'm a messenger of rebellion's supreme council. I have a meeting here. You said you're waiting for a snow. Can't you see there isn't any? Only this damm cold. Come. There is no water here. It has to be. May the Holy Mary, Mother of God take me if I lied to you. Wait. Let's go inside. Give me your hand. Snow. It's like the God heard you. I'll have to go now. Will you return? Will you wait me? I will. Mommy! Mommy and sister Bara are gone. Where? I know where they went.. to kill the nobles. There, eat.. I'm going too. And they scarvenged our cock's tail. I know. Off they go. We're going too. Our Holy Father, One in personality and triple in Trinity.. shall your name be praised and your kingdom ... It's your final hour Tahi! Father! Father! Where is my father? Dad! Where is my father? Why are you silent? Are they there? Noble father?!?! Why are you yelling Gabriel?!? What's with that clothes? Have you seen them?

Who!?!? The Turks?? They have rifles and villas. I don't need a sword for a peasant. They need a whip. Should we fire, noble master? Noone will fire until I say so. Andraž!! Valent!! Take the whips and follow me. Hand me a whip. Open the door! No noble master, you payed me to.. Move away you dog. You won't teach me and stand in my way. Open the door! Why are you here ? What are you seeking? Return home! Do not screw with your head! You only have one! Trial those who rebellled you! It's better if you to trial then, then if I do! Valent! Andraž!

Tell me the news. Let me hear them. Not good, your mightyness. I didn't asked you if they're good. But what they are? I'm going from Početrtek and Brežice, everything's burning. I know, what else do you want to say? Give the man something to drink and let him rest. He came a long way. Draw Brežice and Početrtek. What are you waiting noble Ban? Why don't you use the army against this pagan scum? What army? Don't you have enough mercenaries and haramijas We will all put our peasants under arms too. Your peasants? As long as you call them pagan scum, they will be mightier and stronger. Have you seen their proclamation? What does it says here? Read it? So, say it! What do they want? What do they want? You and me gone. They want to reverse the world. To have their goverment, where we stand now. They will collect taxes by themselves, and defend the borders against the Turks. And all heavenly wisdom and Holy Spirit, collected many years by noble people and protected.. would parish under their bandit law. They are satan's work. So what now, my Ban? We should pray to allmighty God. What now Alapić? Will you go with army we have? They are few. If they strike Zagreb, we will be overrun. Sister, pour the cup to his highness. Fear not. They won't strike. They are no army. For a 100 more years, my Ban. Do you have Duke's authority, traveler? Yes, they gave me this junk. You pass. Smile grandpa. Can't you see he's drawing you. I've been thinking my boy. It's the fourth day now. I don't remember anymore when I was happy for such a long time. You will remember now. That's Krško. And that's the mountain. It's where Steve with his men is. We're here, we arrived. Keep your men ready. We're moving straight on. Where? The brothers who will lead you are here. Gubec sent us the cock's feather. We will fight together for nine years if necesary. We will gather the army You know where you're going Gregorić? I know. I've crossed these lands as a merchant. Not even a bird can fly there during the winter. We won't do flying. We will stamp like a men. You'll see Gubec. We will be in Zagreb soon. We have to be. Only from there we can force Kaiser to recognise our peasant authority. Is everything clear Kupinić? It's clear. Anything else? I want to hug you. We're hugging to much. Save that for Zagreb. Let's go now. I was just going to you Beg. You are needed. You need to judge. About what? Come with me. Wash the saddle good Petey. We have a long journey to make. A long jurney? A really long one. Perhaps even as far as the sea. If it's for peasant struggle we can go as far as the sea. What does he wants from me Gubec? Ask! I ask for a papers. Why should I have the papers? The animals are mine and the cart is mine. I confiscated it by myself with my own men. Im doing my job. Everyone needs to have the papers. We almost crushed one Gubec. We're doing something else now. We're doing order Mikula, don't yapp. We'll never win without an order. That's your order. Mine is that my things always stay mine. We agreed and so is proclamed. Who is caught steeling, will be hanged. Execute the law. Wait men. You can't treat me like this. Gubec, I was among the first who prepared peasant struggle. If you hang me now, tomorrow you'll have to hang the others. Without an end. I'm not your judge Mikula. You judged yourself. I know it's ain't easy for you. But don't doubt this even if your parents tell you so. Noone can call upon it's old credits. Only everyday just makes men noble. Why did we arised, but to change old noblemen 's customs. And tear their rights and privileges. Who want's to reach something big needs to stay alone. But our voice will never be lost. It will be heard through all upcoming times. Nothing is more worth in this world. But this rightful peasant struggle. Out of man's natural love for justice and human life. That's what I wanted to say to you. And it's up to you to judge me and my work however you want. Our good peasant king Matthew. The only one who thinks about us poor men. That's how it is Gubec. Being alone. You said just before. Who want to reach something big, needs to stay alone. Howcome you speak our language so good? I don't even know any other. I am no stranger. I just make up some words that doesn't mean anything. Where are you from? From Medvednica, from Čučerje. If I wouldn't act like a stranger, noone would respect me. Why do you paint blossoms when it's winter outside? The real master can see what others don't. You know it best, Gubec. You don't need to paint peasant's struggle from your head. Hear them? They're going. Going to get the new rebels. Give us a song. You can't go on a journey withour a song. See you in Zagreb, Gubec! The devil will take the noblemen away. Oh, my Sokol. You'll hardly go on with such hoof How to reach Stubica, people? Where do you come from brothers? Tell me what happened to you. Neighbour Martin, what happened to you and these men? You can't go against them, Petey. They are mightier and stronger than us. They are the men of steel. Fear talks out of you, neighbour Martin. They poked out your courage with your eyes. But they'll never beat our whole peasant army. For freedom brothers! Hey, stop! Weren't you with Gregorić? I was. So, what happened? I bring words to Gubec, I just arrived. What words? Tell me! His soldiers are going. I will tell everything to Gubec. He's down there, asemblling the army. Great battle will be tomorrow. So I heard. Have you heard that Kaiser's with us? He will send his best men to our cause. They talk something about this, but I see noone. I've seen it with my own eyes. Kaiser's men are coming to Gubec. Some Krystofor Winkler came, prince's senator. Good, we have a work to do. You hungry? Ask cook for some food. It's okay, I'll find something on my own. Suit yourself. Won't you share with me, mom? I got hungry on my way. You came home son. Take it. Your son came, women. You weren't here for a long time. I was far away. You tired? Yeah, didn't slept for two nights. Did they beat the masters where you were, Petey? Yeah, we chased them all the way to sea, where they drowned. Like rocks. And sister Bara said whe that she will find some friend, when the carnival starts. Eat, Komili. It will be a great fight tomorrow, Petey. It will. What do you think? Are we going to stay alive? We will win. What's this cock? It's long until dawn. What do you think, my son? Nothing mom. I have to go. You're going? Let me hug you at least. We will hug when we won this war. Hug your mom, boy! Don't hide. Your mom bringed you to this world. Sorry Beg, I wanted to hold my tears. That's Gregorić's squire. He says he gots words from him. I remember now, I saw you with him. You're from Gregorić? Yes. Come with us. I'm going after Gubec mom. So I heard. My child. Leave me alone with this boy. Help me take off the boot. It's okay, I can do other on my own. Gregorić failed there. Who told you? I can see it on you. He failed as well as everyone else. Kupinić failed at Krško. They drowned them in Sava. They caught Šterc and imprisoned him. And all the rest of us were attacked by noble armourmen at St. Peter's I wasn't sent by Gregorić, I escaped. I felt fear in the end, so I turned my horse around. And now you can judge me. We need to let them close tomorrow. Hold'em till the end. Until the last moment. It will bring us victory. They say that Kaiser's with us and he will send some help. You know how men prey in Stubica? Not right, not left, but use your head. And look straight ahead. Tomorrow we'll win alone. Without anyone. Because we have noone.. Lie down somwhere. You need to gather strength for tomorrow. Tell me, priest, do us peasants have to work for some seniors up in heaven? Everyone's equal in heaven. Nobody works up there. And I thought that us peasants will have to push some clouds at least up there! But now I'll die gladly. Soldiers! These people came from land of plowing and digging! Their lives are disgraceful and disguisting They are like animals! Like beasts! Which don't know anything about slodier's work, noble millitary arts and war!

Shall I burn the clock too, your highness? Everything! If i said everything, then everything! Note in annals only briefly: Anno Domini 1573. Some bandits and bums, wanted to attack courts in Croatia. But noble masters slayed them, and obediantly brought them to Zagreb. Is this alright, your highness? Blacksmiths made this yesterday in a few moments It's not good mr. Heinchard. It too much resembles the real, royal one. Find some ordinary cow ring. His highness thinks it should all look like some carnival. How is he hanging down there? As soon as someone comes near, he threatens and horrors. I hear all of you. Your hiding is futile, you can't hide your fear. It's bigger then mine. It's the devil himself. He might speak on excecution site. And terrify and touch people. No headache for that your highness. We will stuck an iron wedge in his mouth. It's according to law. There they are. Have you seen our wrath?!? Pigs! Now you'll see the justice!! Cattle! Thieves! You wanted your king? Crappy bastards!! Damm bastards! In the name of holy, unseperable trinity: Father, Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen. Us, Juraj Drašković, ban of Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, declares to everyone who listenes following: Anno Domini 1573., some bandits and bums, hereticly disowed almighty God Nor left, or right, but use your head. ...destroyed the courts throughout Croatia. Look and walk straight in front. .. so we don't hurt their pious ears. On the 15th of February we applied the legal action against you, Gubec, of the unknown name, known as beg. Knock it off. Order by his highness. To throne with him! Quickly! Why are you staring like a wooden statue from church? Come and help me. What do you need? Find some blanket here. He's feeling cold. What have they done out of you. Your own mother couldn't recognize you. I have this left from our war. And I have him left. It's a wonder you're alive. Why wonder? I'm a female. Aren't you cold like this? Yeah, I'm cold. I came to warm up down in the water. I would go too, but I can't leave him. There's some old clothes inside, you can have it. I will. Can you push alone? I'm not pushing alone. Good men help me. I stand by the path and someone comes by. Usualy some soldier. Soldier? He pushes, then he charges me and he goes on.. Why are you picking so much? Take something from that old bum, God rests his soul. No! I don't intend to become a comedian. Who says you have to be a comedian? It's important you aren't cold. Okay. Let it be. If they think this fight is done, they are awfuly mistaken. When we strike for the second time, not even their roots will stay on this land. You're a real Petrica Kerempuh. Do they want me to tell them how I highly respected mister duke.. I'm sorry.. screwed over? Go on, talk. It's like I see him. I won't say this. I will make this. Until you do, help me push this thing. C'mon! Let's sing something. Only nobles have the priviledge to be sad. Us poor people don't. I know only songs from our rebellion. Then let's sing some rebellish. Boy, did we came to a nice place.
