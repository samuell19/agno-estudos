Previously on "One Tree Hill"? Who would have known that Dan Scott?s basketball pedigree would be inherited by his two sons, Nathan Scott and Lucas. I can?t stand being connected to Nathan or Dan. This is all about you, Danny, until you acknowledge that Lucas is your son. I finally saw you clearly for the first time last night, the way you treated me, the way you treated your brother. - Don?t call him that. - I mean it. We?re done. You still in denial? About what? Missing her. What, are you my tutor or my shrink? You?re just tutoring him? I am just tutoring him. Nathan? God! He got a good grade on a math quiz. It was nothing! Keith! I like who you are. And I do count on you. I love you. Wow. You made me a mix? Don?t read too much into it. I think Nathan likes Tutor Girl, but I think Tutor Girl likes Lucas. And I know I like Lucas, and I don?t know who the hell you like anymore. All I remember is you and me and Tutor Girl in my car, and then Lucas and Nathan, and then you said something about being into Lucas but it could have been Nathan, - and I need to know. - Need? Two of them, two of us, plenty of fine Scott boys to go around, and your courtesy hold on Lucas has expired. And you and Nathan were so? interesting together. Plus, we could still trade off once in a while? or twice. Win-win. Hey, broody. Hey, cheery. Peyton. So, I?ll see you at practice? As always. Yeah, you too. So, what?s the deal? Are we gonna hang out at this annual Scott money burn or what? Yeah, right. Like I?m gonna spend the night with Nathan and Dan on my Friday off? I don?t think so. I?d rather stay home with "The Great Gatsby." You know, I read a book last night. Really? Yeah, it?s about this girl and this guy, and they?ve got this really weird vibe thing going on, but there?s all this drama, ?cause the girl?s got this ex-boyfriend who turns out to be none other than the guy?s brother. So the whole thing comes to this great, big climax and this big party at their evil dad?s house. Really? Hmm. What happens in the end? You?re just gonna have to show up to find out. Oh, this is so stupid. What-why do we have to study history anyway? So we?re not doomed to repeat it. What? Look, don?t lose hope, okay? Tomorrow?s a teacher?s work day so you?ve got a three-day weekend to study. Minus my dad?s annual kiss-his-ass jamboree. Hey, I would invite you, Haley, but it?s kind of a b-ball crowd. Oh, please, come on. Like I want to kiss your dad?s ass anyway. Yeah. I made you a study guide. And, everything you need to ace your history exam? is right in this little box of tricks here-NoDoz, eye drops, number-two pencils. Why don?t you just text message me the answers. Oh! No. So, um, just give me a call if you need anything, okay? Thanks for cutting Lucas some slack. A deal?s a deal, right? Right. Anything worth sharing? - Hmm? - In the paper? Oh. Um, the Tar Heels won. - Oh, Deb. - Hi, Karen. Hey. Um, I never heard from both of you about Dan?s party tomorrow for the team sponsors. For some reason, when I think of Dan, I just don?t think of the word party. Oh, I?m sorry, Deb. I have the invitation here. I was thinking about going, but after everything that happened last week- Yeah, that?s what I was afraid of. Dan feels horrible about that? - believe it or not. - Not. And so do I. Anyway, it would mean a lot if you could both come. It starts at three, but, uh, stop by anytime. See you. See you, Deb. Thanks. You know what? I think Deb?s right. We?re not living in some 1950s movie. I am the single mom of a player on the team. I don?t need to skulk around this town in a head scarf and dark glasses. Well, you?re never going to get Lucas to go. - Oh, even if you?re going, too? - Oh, not a chance. Besides, I don?t want things to be any weirder than they need to be. Weirder? How? Well, you know, after dinner the other night, I said some pretty crazy things. No, I don?t remember anything crazy. Well, I?m gonna go. You let me know if you change your mind. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. Okay, you guys, listen up. Now, you?ll all want to pay close attention to this next batch of slides. We?ll be discussing them following the slide show and, I also have a feeling that this material may find its way onto your next quiz, so? How are you, Nate? Bored. And lonely, right? Just a smidge. Brooke, whatever drugs you?re on, save them for the party, okay? Ah, "the party." Guess who?s coming with me, and I?ll tell you Peyton. Whatever. She?s off my radar, and apparently, I?m off hers too. That was pot Peyton. She?s totally back on track. And I think the new "old Peyton" would be open to discussing a reconciliation. Did she tell you that? She tells me everything. - What are you up to, Brooke? - What? I just want to see two people that are perfect for each other back together. Is that a crime? Sorry I?m late, coach. Why should today be any different, Jagielski? Move your ass. The rest of you ladies start defense drills, pronto! Why is coach so easy on you, Jagielski? Baumgartner got wind sprints. We party together. Maybe they?re lovers. Why, did you two break up? So, anyway, man, what?s the deal? What?s going on? You know, you?re out sick all the time, and you come in late and cut out early. I don?t understand. Coach just lets you. Just helping me out. Meaning? Meaning he?s just helping me out. All right. - Whoa! Walking here. - God! I?m-I?m sorry. Like you weren?t aiming. You?re not on that list. You need a ride somewhere? Come on, get in. I guess it?s better to be in your car then under it. So, I?m not really good at this. Yeah, obviously you?re gonna want to put that in gear and give it a little gas. No, I meant... I mean the whole not-being-defensive thing. Okay. Last week in Brooke?s car, you said he cares about me, and I was trying really hard to be cool, and I didn?t ask, - whether you meant Nathan or Lucas. - And now you?re asking? In a pathetic kind of way, yeah. I?m not gonna be much help. I guess I meant both of them. Lucky you. Look, it?s not like you need my permission or anything, but if you like Nathan, it?s totally cool. Just be really careful. Be careful. Yes, I know. You told me. - You be careful, too. - With which one? Driving. My mother likes it when I get home alive. Let?s go. Hey, mom. Hey, Keith. This doesn?t fit anymore. I need a new jacket. I think I?m going to go to this thing tomorrow. What changed your mind? Well, I don?t know. I mean? Nothing really. Well, we?ll go to Vietti?s first thing. Get you a new jacket. All right. Thanks, mom. See you, Keith. See you, Luke. - A girl? - What else? Hmm. Well, I guess I?m gonna have to go to this thing then. You? I thought you already had your mind made up. - Did you get cold feet? - Like ice. Something about stepping directly into the Lion?s Den. Oh? Okay, you talked me into it. Just promise me you won?t punch him unless I ask you real nice. Okay. - Enjoy. - Bye-bye. Haven?t you heard goth is the new geek? Tonight?s gonna be killer. You and Nathan, me and Lucas, an open bar. There is no me and Nathan, or you and Lucas, for that matter. For now. You know, Nathan?s loving the idea that you?re coming tonight. How do you know that? ?Cause he told be he?s still hot for you. He was actually very sweet about it. Nathan Scott? You know you two were meant to be together. That?s a scary thought. Haley? What are you doing here? First, I am saving you from that tie. Second? we need to talk. Well, could we do both at the same time. Yeah. Uh, okay, you?re not gonna like this. In fact? you?re gonna hate this. But I feel that I should tell you in the interest of full friendship disclosure. Yeah, right. What could be worse than you tutoring Nathan, huh? You like him. Luke, do not freak out on me, okay? I can?t help it any more then you can. - I don?t like him! - I?m talking about you and Peyton. We don?t decide who we like. We just-it happens. Do you know what you?re getting yourself into? I?m not getting myself into anything. I am thinking about maybe getting into something that is never gonna happen anyway, so- But what could you possibly like in the guy, huh? Different stuff. We connect. Yes, he can be a total ass sometimes but I?m telling you, it?s just a defense mechanism. He really opens up with me, Lucas. You know how I feel about it. And I?m sorry for that. I am. But I get it, all right? I understand. Okay. Just do me a favor, okay? Just- Be careful? I wish everybody would stop saying that. Three fingers of whiskey, just a whisper of sweet vermouth, a splash of bitters, a crush cherry- A perfect Manhattan. Oh, so that?s how you like it? Well, that?s one way I like it. Excuse us. She?s young enough to be your daughter, and in this town, she might just be. - Ouch. - Sorry, couldn?t resist. I spoke with Karen yesterday. She might be coming with Lucas and Keith. They had to know the invitation was just a formality. Mm. Until I invited them in person. Deb, you know how important this party is for me. Oh, I thought this party was for the team. So you go behind my back and turn into my worst nightmare. Oh, no, Dan. Your worst nightmare is what?ll happen if they show up and you do anything to make them feel uncomfortable in our home. Hey, guys, maybe we should have, like, a signal. You know, in case one of us wants to leave. Maybe we should just leave. Oh, come on. That?s no fun. How about "caw"! "Caw"? Yeah. You know, like a raven. Caw! Caw! That?s the spirit. So, when one of us wants to leave, we just "caw." Caw! Caw! You ready, mom? Ready as I?ll ever be. You know, maybe the best plan is to just avoid him all night, and then that way? Come on in. Spirit. The vital principle and animating force within every human being. Of course, for some of you, spirit simply means alcoholic beverages. But this Ravens basketball team has a surplus of spirit. It?s an incredible team with an incredible group of young men. Except for their crushing defeat by the fathers this year, this team has been on a roll. Well? - Oh, it is so on tonight. - ? my lovely wife for setting up this party. Look at this, please. But Raven team spirit also includes the parents and the local businesses, whose financial svpp0rt m4k3 th1s t34m gr34t. Tonight?s for you. Enjoy. And here?s to our host, Dan Scott. - Here, here! - My parents are such suck-ups. So, what public humiliation you got planned for "Pukas" tonight? Nothing, Tim. It?s a little played out, don?t you think? Since when? You had a little sin of omission there in your speech, Danny boy. Didn?t I mention the coaching staff? If you did, I didn?t hear it. Here? you?re out of cashews. I?m gonna grab a drink at the bar before it fills up. You go talk to Nathan. See how he?s been looking at you? They?re never gonna serve you. Watch and learn. Bartenders love me. Soda or juice? Actually, I was gonna ask if you knew how to make a screaming orgasm. For a pretty girl like you, sure. So, what is this thing tonight? Ravens basketball. Oh. And what position do you play? Cheerleader. Jocks and cheerleaders. Lots of hormones tonight. Don?t go around advertising. Secret?s safe with me. I?ll have what she?s having. Right. Soda or juice? You would think that after 20 years, your brother?s ego would cease to amaze me. Try a lifetime. Hi. I?ll take a white wine, please. I?ll have club soda. Hey, Laurie, pour me a double shot of your best top-shelf bourbon, would you, please? - Hello, Keith. - Hey, Whitey. Well, Karen Roe. Look at you. Coach Durham. Most grown-ups call me Whitey. It?s good to see you coming ?round again. Seeing you in my gym really turns back the clock. For me, too. Well, in my humble opinion, you have raised a fine son. You should be proud, and not just of the boy. Thank you. You know, there are some states that could arrest you for what you?re thinking about right now. How are you doing, Jake? I?m good. You do your thing, man. Hey, Jake, Lucas. Two handsome boys for the price of one. Hey, Brooke. Listen, I was gonna... Where are you going? I haven?t had the chance to invite you to the real party. It?s at my place, later. I?m only inviting the cool people, but I guess you can come. You too, Jake. Oh, thanks, Brooke, but I gotta cut out early tonight. Oh, like that?s a surprise. Obligations, man. I?ll see you, Luke. Take care, man. All right, Brooke. Just go easy, okay? Obligations? What is his deal? Look, I don?t know. Could you just excuse me? Well, I was gonna say, my parents usually close this place down every year, so if you wanted, we could go back to my place and start the party early. We have a Jacuzzi. - That sounds tempting, Brooke... - We have a naked me in a Jacuzzi. Okay. Um, what if I told you there was someone else? Normally, I?d suggest a threesome, but I think the person you have in mind is getting back together with her old boyfriend. So, uh, did you get my messages? Yeah, I got all of them. I don?t blame you for not calling me back. Are you being self-deprecating? Probably? if I knew what that meant. Do you want to, uh? Do you want to go somewhere and talk? Just to talk, Peyton. Just to talk. See what I mean? Karen Roe? in Dan Scott?s house? with Keith Scott as her date. Nothing gets past you, Shari. - Well, Keith and I are just friends. - Oh, of course you are. Um, one Scott brother to the next- You practically need a scorecard around here to keep up with you people. Karen, there you are. I need your expert opinion in the kitchen. - Excuse us, Shari. - Oh, yeah. You?re lucky she didn?t knee you. So, I see you smiling at school a lot. That?s good. You?ve been looking? Yeah, sometimes. Anyway, uh? Look, I don?t know if Brooke is just playing games or what. She said you were into us getting back together. Funny. She told me the same thing. Right. Look, the thing is? Oh. Sorry. We?ll come back. But there?s vodka in the drawer. Tim, later. These two need some space. You know what, Brooke? Give it up. Trust me, I?m trying. - You know what I mean. - I?m just trying to help. Help with what? Get me out of the way so you can go embarrass yourself in front of Lucas? That?s funny. I didn?t realize you were in my way. Are you finally fessing up? Or, are you finally denying it? What the hell is wrong with you, Brooke? Nathan, Believing you will do well is half the battle? Call me if you need anything at all! Haley Perfect. Thought I?d find you near the bar. It?s club soda. Well, that?s a good thing considering. How ?bout we don?t do this right now, huh? How about you meet me halfway. I say I'm sorry, you say you're sorry, we shake hands and go from there. It works for me. Well, you see, that?s the problem, Dan. It always has to work for you. Okay. How ?bout we don?t do this right now. You in the mood to apologize, Dan? Why don?t you start with Karen or Lucas or maybe even Nathan, hmm? I?m gonna do you a solid, big brother. Just walk away. This is a very nice kitchen. Oh, thanks. I?m afraid it?s wasted on me. Where did you learn to cook? Oh, books, trial and error, a lot of burnt casseroles. And I get to experiment a lot at the caf?. Oh, I?ll have to eat there some night. Don?t worry, I?ll come alone. Hi. There?s been a mix-up. The baker seems to have delivered the cakes to a bar mitzvah in Charlotte. You know, I have a lot of desserts at the caf?. I?d be happy to contribute. Oh no, I don?t want to put you to that trouble. No, no. It?s no trouble. I?ll call Haley. Haley? Um? is she a tutor, by any chance? Yeah, she is. Why? Oh, no. It?s a small world. She must be the girl who?s helping Nathan. Oh. She must be. Haven?t seen you much today. Yeah, I know. Every time I get within about five feet of you- Brooke happens. Or Nathan. Loose ends. Those are all tied up now. Looks like she got you right here. Listen up, everybody? it?s time to play truth or dare. Or maybe just dare, ?cause nobody really tells the truth anymore. Let?s see? Theresa, I dare you? to go pinch Whitey?s ass. Be right back. - Let?s see? Peyton? - Brooke, come on. I dare you to show us how you really feel. Kiss Lucas. Why are you being such a bitch tonight, Brooke? Well, I thought you liked that in a girl. You should put some ice on it. So that was? Yeah. What was that exactly? A game? Kind of. Not really. Want to play again? Sorry. Uh, sorry. I just? Your mom called with an SOS, so I just thought I?d sneak in the back - and not bother anyone. - You need some help? No. I?ll... You?ve got your hands full. So, I?m just gonna-carry on. Everything you need? for a first class sugar coma. Oh, let?s see. Oh, these cakes are gorgeous. Who makes them? These guys. Thank you, Haley. The caterers can take it from here. Go join your friends. Have some food. No, that?s okay. I have to get back, anyway. I?m still on the clock. Did you lock up when you left, turn off the coffee machine? Yeah. Well, then you?re off the clock. Great, then it?s settled. Uh, I?ll get some waiters to serve these. She seems kind of cool. How are you holding up? Well, I haven?t had to, uh-caw!-yet. Okay, whatever that means. - Haley? - Hmm? Why didn?t you tell me it was Nathan you were tutoring? Oh, uh? it just seemed kind of weird. Lucas wasn?t really happy about it, so I just figured you wouldn?t be too happy about it. I wasn?t even sure if I was happy about it. And now? Um?now things are okay with Lucas and with me. And with me. Now go, have fun. It only comes around once. Okay. You know, I can?t believe I?m gonna say this, but, um, I?m glad I came. So, what do we do now? I don?t know. What happens next in the story you were telling me about? Come on. Haley? Hey! Um, I?m not crashing. I promise. Your mom just wanted some cakes. Cakes? Yeah. It?s a long story. She invited me to stay and I sort of had a brain freeze and said "sure"?and it?s probably really weird. I?m actually gonna leave. No, no, no. I?m glad you came. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, I?d even study right now. It?d be a hell of a lot more fun than this suck-fest. - Sorry. I?m off-duty. - Well, then let me get you a drink. Okay. Tutor girl! - It?s Haley. - Brooke? Haley, right. Nathan?s own personal little care package. Everything?s starting to make so much more sense now. You two are adorable. What was my favorite part? "Believing you?ll do well is half the battle?" You know, Tutor Girl?s little love note you passed around earlier- the one that said, "Call me if you need anything? at all." All right, Haley, I... Stay away from me. Games are getting old, Brooke. Cover me. Shari?s proposing a couples cruise. Oh no. I have to confess something. I have been pretty judgmental about you. - How could you not be? - I really didn?t want to like you. I?m hoping there?s a "but" in there somewhere. There is. I was wrong. I?m really glad I?ve had this chance to get to know you. Oh, that make?s two of us. There are so many questions. That makes two of us again. You start. When you met Dan, did he tell you about me? He said he?d had a girlfriend in high school. - Did you know I was pregnant? - He conveniently left that out. I didn?t find out about you until we were married and living in Tree Hill. - Oh, I would?ve killed him. - Oh, I almost did. - So when did you... - Dan and I met at Freshman Orientation. That was about a month after I told him I was pregnant. A few months later, I was pregnant, too. You know Dan, always the overachiever. Don?t take this the wrong way, Karen. But I?m glad I didn?t know about you back then because if I did I wouldn?t have Nathan. I know what you mean. I love my son, but sometimes I wonder how I could have been that reckless. We were kids. Don?t need this... or this. I?ve wanted this for so long. Me too. And now we can have it. No, no, no. I don?t mean just that. I want this. You know? I want to be here. I want to have everything with you. I want it all. I want us, Peyton. Hey, what?s wrong? - This isn?t supposed to be that. - Peyton... Why couldn?t you just leave it alone? Interesting. You?ve always made me out to be the bad guy. Maybe you?ll judge me a little different now. Spare me a lecture. Just trying to give you the benefit of my experience. In what-fathering a child? or abandoning one? Seems to me you?re one mistake away from both. Yeah, well, one?s an accident. The other?s a choice. Excuse me. Excuse me. "Caw?" Hey, listen, you guys can stay if you want. I think I?m gonna cut out. - What happened? - Nothing. I?m just done is all. All right. Well, let me go grab my coat. Hey, take your time. You guys go ahead. I?ll be in the car, all right? - Lucas? - Come on, Brooke. Not now. Jake? Jake, Jake, Jake. Oh, Brooke, Brooke, Brooke. I?m drunk. You?ll do. Oh, oh, hey, um, it?s quite an honor, but I got to be somewhere. Oh, right-the big mystery. - Yeah. Anyway, I should... - What?s going on anyway? Lucas turns me down. You turn me down. Oh, my god! I got it! You?re both gay. That totally explains it. Yeah, yeah, we are. We?re actually-we?re gay. Whatever you say, Brooke. Then what is it? Come on, you can tell me. I won?t even remember tomorrow. You want to know? The truth would kill your buzz. Deb put this room together for me a few Christmas?s ago. It?s nice. Anyway, I just came to get my coat. Karen, why are you doing this? For Lucas. And for me. For you? What do you get out of it? I get to move on. And that?s pretty liberating. Look around you, Dan. You have a wonderful life. Why are you spending it stuck in the past? Haley? Hey, Hales! Is this floor taken? You know, just this once, I deserve a big, fat "I told you so." Well, you won?t get it from me. What happened? Exactly what you told me was gonna happen. I started believing that he wasn?t terrible, and he proved me wrong. Once again, the smart girl is really stupid. Hey, hey. You are not stupid. Thanks. Well, at least things are working out for one of us. It looks like you and Peyton are headed in the right direction. Well, if it?ll make you feel better, that lasted all of about five minutes. It doesn?t make me feel any better. Well, welcome back. To where? Normal. Yeah. They can have their world. Come on. Let me help you close up. No, thanks. I?ll do it. I just? I just want to be alone for a little while, okay? I?ll be fine. I?ll be okay. I?m okay. All right. Great party, as always, Dan. Oh, thanks, Peter. Deb, honey, you got to send me the number for the caterer. Those cakes were to die for. Oh, it?s in the book under "Karen?s Caf?." Really? Well, who knew? - Good night. - Bye-bye. So, was it all you wanted it to be? ?Cause, I think it?s the first year I?ve actually enjoyed myself. Might have even made a new friend. I noticed. Thank you for being on your best behavior. You really stepped up. Did I? ?Cause I can?t ever remember feeling more off-balance. Hey. Can I come in? Haley, I didn?t know. Come on. Please, you got to believe me. Sweet dreams, baby. Daddy loves you, all right?
