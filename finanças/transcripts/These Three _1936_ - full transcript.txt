[instrumental music] [music continues] [indistinct singing] [male #1] 'That concludes the exercises.' [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] [female #1] 'Martha! Martha.' Excuse me, please. Martha. Here I am, Martha. - Martha, dear. - Aunt Lily. - And Karen. - Hello. A glorious, glorious day. Wouldn't have missed it for the world. Yes. Glorious. No matter how many sacrifices I made to send Martha here, it's all been worth it today. Sacrifices? Aunt Lily, I have worked awfully hard to stay in college. All sacrifices are not made in terms of money, Martha. Isn't that so, Karen? Oh, my train. I must get a cab. Come along. I'm off to St. Louis. You can join me next week in St. Louis. Uh, not as good a Stock Company as I am accustomed to, but.. What are your plans for the future, dear? You know you can always make yourself useful helping me with my part. No, Aunt Lily. No. I've no plans but I'll write you. Oh, really.. Oh, taxi, just a moment. Uh, Martha um, my salary, not until next week, dear. And I had to get some very new clothes for my part and-- Yes, alright, I haven't earned much lately but I'll mail it to you. - Alright. G-goodbye, dear. - Bye. Goodbye, Karen. Goodbye, goodbye. Goodbye. We'll be seeing you soon. Goodbye. [music continues] Where are you going to send that trunk when you get it packed? To Lancet, maybe if I go there I can sell that old farmhouse my grandmother left me. It's about all I've got. Suddenly, I know about not having any family and not having any home. I always thought this would be a happy day. Strange. It isn't. What are you going to do? Oh, I don't know, teach somewhere, I guess if I can get a job. Do you think I could teach? Maybe we could find some place together? Two well-educated young women. Also neat and clean, wish position. Martha, that farm of mine I haven't seen it in years, but it's a lovely old place. I used to spend my summers there when I was a little girl. We could go there. Why not? Why shouldn't we? We could work there. - Teaching the farmhands? - No, no. There isn't anyone there anymore. Hasn't been for years. Martha, we might start a school. Something of our own. 'It would be fun and we'd be good at it, too.' Oh, but it isn't practical, Karen. But we've got to do something. Oh, Martha, take a chance with me and come. Take a chance with me. [train chugging] [instrumental music] Will you take us out to Mulberry Road? It's about a mile past the old Foster place. Well, let's see now. That's about five miles. Uh, that would be, uh, five dollars. - Oh. - Well, say.. I could take you a little shorter way. It would be three dollars, but I can't do better. Then let's go by the three-dollar way. [engine whirring] Ain't that funny? It always acts that way in the three-dollar trip. [giggling] [engine revving] [instrumental music] [mellow music] [male #2] 'Well. Here we be.' Are you sure this is the right place? Yep. I guess you'll be wanting to go back later. That will be five dollars if you call me at night 'cause I've gotta go by the long way. [engine revs] [music continues] Welcome to our house, Miss Dobie. Lafayette ate dinner here. It doesn't matter, Karen. It matters a great deal. [music continues] [thuds] There must be a train sometime this evening. Perhaps it wouldn't cost too much to fix it up. No. Not much. About a million dollars, might do it. [clattering] [dramatic music] Is he really knocking down the house? And that thing on his head? Maybe he's something from long ago. I say! Uh, gentleman! Sir! Mister! I say, you! You up there with the bees. Oh, yes. How do you do? We're alright, thank you. We were just a little worried about you. Oh these? Oh, I won't get stung. No. That isn't quite what we were worrying about. You see, this is a house. And while it isn't the best house I've ever seen, it belongs to me. And I'd rather not have its roof knocked off. Belongs to you? Hey, you aren't old Mrs. Wright, are you? No, I am not old Mrs. Wright. She was eighty when she died. I'm her granddaughter. Well, I didn't think you looked eighty, but.. You can't tell these days, can you? Both of you look rather young, in fact. - 'Do you live up there?' - No, but the bees do. They've been at your roof for years now. They've ruined it for you. I've only assisted them in the most minor way. He assists bees. Well now, I really haven't done any harm. I'm very fond of this old place. I come here whenever I have a day off from the hospital. Oh, the hospital. I see. You've, uh, you've been there a while? Well, in a way. I'm a doctor. [birds chirping] Here it is. Have a sandwich. - No, thank you. - No, thank you. Alright. Do you always wear that when you eat? No. Uh, would you untie this for me? Uh, right back here, please. Well, that bucket belongs to you now. You'll like it. It's very good honey. I shan't need it. We're not staying here. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Uh, would you, uh.. Do you find you need that egg on the left? - Oh, please. - Thank you. And they're very good sandwiches. Sit down. Please. I won't bite you. Why aren't you staying here? This is a lovely old place. What's the matter? You afraid of work? No. We're not afraid of work. I see, two rich young women who can wander around the world and live any place you happen to like, huh? Yes, we are very rich. We have exactly $38 between us. And we figure that will last us for the rest of our lives. Hm, it's a lot of money. Hey, you know, my place was just as bad as this. It didn't cost much to fix it. Much less than you think. Borrowed a little money from the bank and.. It was fun doing it, so much fun I'd like to start all over again. Anything you could do, we could undoubtedly do. I think so. You know I used to do an operation in the hospital then run home to paint the left side of the house. We wouldn't starve anyway, Karen. We'd always have free honey. And free help. I'm a good carpenter. A good house painter and a good plumber. Why are we talking to this man in this way? As though we've known him all our lives. That happens sometimes. Come on, Martha. Quick before he talks us into this. No, come on. Come on. See your house. You know, you'd be my neighbors. I can't let you go now without a struggle. [instrumental music] [knock on door] Anybody home? Hello. Oh. Well, I remember you when your face was clean. - We missed you yesterday. - What are you doing? Look what I found. "May 25th, 1883." - "Brooklyn Bridge opens." - "Two great cities united." "A fair day for the ceremony. "May women wore their fur tippets. And the pearl grey bowlers of the gentlemen.." It was also attended by His Honor the Mayor and his fat wife. And all the beaus and belles of Brooklyn and Manhattan in their fluffery.. - 'Is that you, Joe?' - Yeah. - 'Come on, lazy. I need help.' - Where are you? [instrumental music] - You alright? - Sure. Oh! Sure. I'm fine. I'm full of splinters. I mean, is the lumber alright? That's the important thing. I could always take out your splinters. I'm sorry. I guess we'll have to push. Oh. How do you do, Mrs. Tilford? - Hello, Dr. Cardin. - I'm sorry to hold you up. I wonder if you'd mind if your chauffeur gave me a hand with this lumber? - No. Of course not. - We're sorry to be in your way. - Not at all. - John, will you.. Come on, Karen. Come on. I've gotta push this lumber again. Oh, I'm tired of seeing you push lumber. - Are you Karen Wright? - Yes. I am Amelia Tilford. I knew your grandmother very well. How do you do, Mrs. Tilford? Uh, this is my granddaughter, Mary Tilford. - How do you do? - How do you do? I've been hearing all about you and Miss Dobie in the village. How are the plans for the new school coming on? Oh, well, it's a little hard, you see we don't know many people here. Well then, perhaps we can help each other. I've just taken Mary out of her old school. Could you and Miss Dobie come and have tea with me next week? I think we might arrange to have Mary be with you. Oh, we'd like to very much, Mrs. Tilford. Fine, in the meantime I'll talk to my friends around here. Grandma, you said maybe I wouldn't have to go to another school. You said I could have a teacher at home. - You told me-- - Mary. Thank you so much, Mrs. Tilford. We are very grateful to you. Well then, I'll see you next week. Alright, John. Goodbye. [both] Goodbye. [engine revs] It's magic, Joe. We've got a pupil. She can make the school for you. Anything she says goes round here. They follow her like lambs. I knew something good would happen to you. Won't Martha be happy. And it all seemed so hard and impossible before. Nonsense. Going back to get my lumber. We've got a lot of work to do. [instrumental music] - What did you do? - Nothing. Just took a splinter out of your hair. Hurry up. [engine whirring] [engine whirs] Well. It's the place. I'm accustomed to having the driver open the door. Why? Got a bad arm? Martha! Hello. Hello. Hello. Martha, I am so glad to see you. I had a most difficult time getting here but I'll tell you all about that later. Oh, what an odd place. Strange. But quaint. Very quaint. How well you look. Almost pretty. And Karen. Oh, Karen. And Karen darling. Prettier than ever. I'm so glad to see you dear. How are you? And now, who is this gentleman? Your, y-your assistant? - Oh, this, uh.. - Yes, ma'am. This is Dr. Cardin, a friend of ours. [laughs] Oh. Oh, I am so sorry. Really. I'm-I'm, I'm so-so pleased to meet you. Aunt Lily, is this a visit? You see, we aren't very well equipped here. We've been having an awfully hard time. Oh, I know, dear. I know all about the school too. That's why I am here. To-to put my shoulder to the wheel with yours. I knew very well that you needed an elocution teacher. And a general supervisor. And that's why I came. Aunt Lily, this is Karen's house. But I'm here to help you both, dear. And until you get started I shall take only the smallest fee for my services. - Oh, will you help? - Oh, certainly. Now I shall go upstairs with the luggage and rest a few hours. And then I'll be down and help you arrange the furniture. Uh, come, doctor. - The Duchess? - The Duchess. Yes, the Duchess. You alright, Martha? [instrumental music] Girls. Your class timetables will be posted on the bulletin board in the hall. You'll find your books in the library. Your regular classes won't begin until Wednesday. We want you to take this evening and tomorrow to get to know each other. And to feel that this is your home. We're happy to have you here and hope we can make you just as happy to be here. - Now go and have a good time. - Yes. Yes, yes indeed. And we want you to remember that we, your teachers, were young once ourselves. Not so long ago, however that we've had time to forget your problems. Very well. Dismissed. [indistinct chatter] [speaking in foreign language] "Indicman." - Indicium. - Indicium. "This plan was.." [mumbling] "This plan was "made known to the Helvetians by...by.." Indicium. Index. Which is your index finger, Rosalie? 'What do you use it for?' - To point. - To point out. To indicate, to inform. - By informers. - 'That's right.' [Rosalie reads] What are you doing? My gold bracelet. It's gone. I wonder who stole it. I didn't say anybody stole it. Hey. Look. [giggling] - 'Looks just like her.' - 'Mary.' Will you read the next lines? "On the day appointed for the holding of the trial "Geterix drew to the hearing all his.. "His retinue, numbering ten thousand persons. "And all of his followers and debtors "of whom he had a great number. "He gathered there too. With their help, he saved himself from going to trial." [bell rings] Mary. That was a lovely translation, Mary. It was just as lovely when Professor Hobson of Harvard published it about ten years ago. [girls laughing] Tomorrow, I'd like your own, less perfect translation. You can leave the phony upstairs. Now run along, girls. It's a fine day for your hockey. [upbeat music] [indistinct chatter] [cheering] Let me see. "Meat. Bacon. Bread.." [slurping] "Olives, fruit. Lettuce and chicken." Oh, I forgot the chicken. Mm-hm, and cocoa. I've gotta get some cocoa. And castor oil. Do you know? I never realized how much castor oil these children need. And I never realized how tired you look. Come on, take a vacation with me this afternoon. What do you need? I know just the place to go. No, certainly not. I've gotta get back. Why do you have to get back? The castor oil can wait. No, it can't. I've got to get back. Well, just as you say. Mm! Ah! Put me down, you idiot! Put me down, you're hurting me! - Hey.. - Oh! Would you let me go? Oh! - Now, you let me go! - Oh! [screams] Oh! - Is she alright, doc? - Yes, just a mild fit. So young, doctor, is she.. Uh, bad blood in the whole family. What? You let me go immediately.. [engine revving] [instrumental music] - Hi! Have some popcorn. - Thanks! Oh, Karen, let's get off this thing. Five times is enough. Five times is enough. Music. I say, let's get off this thing. I've got something very important to tell you. I say, I've got something very important to-- Can't hear. Karen, will you get off this thing, I've got-- Can't hear! Go away! I've been trying to tell you for an hour. [laughs] - Hey! - Excuse me. I beg your pardon. Listen, darling, I.. [Karen laughs] Will you get off that thing? [music continues] Well, that was fun. - We can go back later. - Uh-huh. Oh, I'm hungry. I'd love a piece of cake. - Wouldn't you? - Nope. You mean, youdon't want a piece of cake? - What's the matter with you? - I'm bored. You're awfully grouchy. Do you want a bite? I know what's the matter with you. You've been working too hard. That's it. Oh. Something happened at the hospital? Yes, dear. I mean, did a bad case come in or something? Well, Jones came in today, dear and I said to him, "Jones" I said, "Now is the time to buy all the bonds "you can lay your hands on. "My wife wants you to come to dinner as soon as we've a new cook." And then I went down to the Stock Exchange. And bought nine million shares of Abyssinian preferred. Then my seven secretaries came in and I.. Oh, stuff that men-women talk, will you. - It makes me sick. - What's the matter with you? This is what's the matter with me. I'm in love with you! I've been trying to tell you so for an hour. Now I'm tired out, see. And I can't tell you! I can't ever tell you. I won't be able to. [mellow music] There aren't words enough to tell you with. But I love you, see. I love you with all my heart. And I love you with all my heart. [instrumental music] Karen. - Hey, Karen. - Stop making such a row. She went in town for supplies. She'll be back later. Come on up and help me paint a table. Alright. How is the hospital? Oh, just the same. A bad laboratory, no money and everybody growling at everybody else. Phew. I'm tired. Gee, it's quiet around here. Is it late? No, but the girls are in bed and Aunt Lily is all worn out from doing nothing. [giggles] Karen tells me your aunt was showing the girls how to play King Lear the other day. That will come in handy later in their lives. Oh, that's nothing. Wait until she does Portia standing on a chair. Sir Henry told her to do it that way. Said it was the test of a great actress. You must have had a fine childhood. Oh, I did. I did indeed. How I used to hate it, though. I was so ashamed then.. I went to sixteen schools altogether. Every time the Stock Company would move, I'd move with it. School wasn't the worst part. It was after school and never anything but bad little hotel bedrooms to go home to. In the evening, I'd do my homework sitting on a dirty box back stage. Jumping up to help Aunt Lily change from a blousy costume to an even blousier one. I was so alone and so sorry I couldn't have what other kids had. Well, I think that's really the reason I decided to teach. Being young is awfully hard and I wanted to make it easier for other kids when I grew up. I'm running out of paint. Want a glass of milk? [mellow music] Asleep, Joe? [music continues] [clock chimes] [instrumental music] [clattering] Oh! Do you always wake up so violently? - I was asleep. - Doctors never sleep. - Sorry, I.. So clumsy. - Oh, that's alright. Sorry to have kept you up so late, Martha. I heard a very strange crash. - Oh. - It was me. I was wrestling with myself. You're a late visitor, aren't you? No. Oh, no. As a matter of fact, I've been here for four days. I was hiding in your trunk. Goodnight, Martha. Goodnight. Don't go. Karen will be home in a minute. Well, I gotta get home. I'll have at least five calls from the hospital. And warn Karen that when we're married she'll have to stay home and watch me knock over milk glasses. Goodnight. I hope I'm not hurrying you off. Oh, not any more than usual. Joe is so in love with Karen, isn't he? I do hope they will have the wedding in the spring. We could stage it so well in the garden. Of course, when they get married it will be rather hard on you. But Karen says she intends to keep right on with the school. There was never any question of that. And it really won't be so lonely for you because you'll be seeing her all the time. And you'll be seeing Joe too. You might even be seeing him more often. Goodnight. [Martha crying] [mellow music] [upbeat music] "It is twice blessed, it blesses him "that gives and him that takes. "It is mightiest in the mightiest. "It becomes a throned monarch better than his crown. '"The scepter shows the force of temporal power.' - "The attribute to.." - Ah! [clattering] Girls. Girls. You are disturbing our enjoyment of Shakespeare. Can't you sit quietly? And drink in the immortal words of the immortal bard? Continue, Evelyn. "The attribute to our majesty "wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings. "But mercy is above the sceptered sway. It is enthroned in the hearts of kings." - "It is an att--" - Evelyn. Evelyn. Can't you imagine yourself as Portia? Can't you read the lines with some feeling, some pity? Ah, pity. As Sir Henry said to me many as the time '"Pity makes the actress."' Why can't you feel pity? Well, I guess I can feel pity. Well, go on then and feel it. [Evelyn] '"It is twice blessed, it blesses him' '"that gives and him that takes.' '"Mightiest in the mightiest.' '"It becomes the throned monarch' 'better than his crown."' '"The scepter shows the force of temporal power.' '"The attribute to awe and majesty' '"wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings.' '"But mercy is above this sceptered sway.' '"It is enthroned in the hearts of kings.' "It is an attribute to God himself. And earthly power doth then show likest God's." - "When mercy seasons justice.." - Mary. Are you just arriving for your elocution class? If you have no interest in your work, then.. Oh. I went to get these flowers for you, Mrs. Mortar. You told us you loved flowers and I walked so far to find them for you. That was very, very sweet of you. I suppose I will have to forgive you this once. Uh, thoughtfulness and courtesy mean breeding. Uh, breeding is an excellent thing in woman. I think you better write that down. All of you. Mary, put them in a vase for me. Yes, ma'am. - Good morning, Miss Wright. - Good morning. Evelyn has just been reading Portia for us. Oh, sometimes, I think that Evelyn hasn't quite the right feeling for Portia. Where did you get those flowers, Mary? Oh, she picked them just for me. It made her a little late for class. The first wild-flowers of the season. But not the very first. Where did you get them, Mary? Near Conway's cornfield. It wasn't necessary to go quite so far. There was a bunch exactly like that in the garbage can this morning. [all exclaiming] Oh. What a nasty thing to do, deceiving me. And I suppose you have just as fine an excuse for all the other times? That will be all, girls. [indistinct chatter] Just a minute, Mary. Miss Wright, I have to get my Latin book. No, stay. Come with me, Mary. Mary, why do you do these things? Why do you lie to us so often? I'm not lying. If you have to do things, come and tell us about it. We'll try to understand. We'll try to help you. But this kind of lying is so bad for everybody. I got the flowers near Conway's cornfield. Very well, Mary. You will have to be punished. There doesn't seem to be any other way. Take your recreation periods alone. No hockey, no horseback riding. Don't leave the school grounds for any reason whatsoever. But you said I could go to the boat race this Saturday. I'm sorry. You can't go. I'll tell my grandmother! I'll tell her how I'm treated here and how you punish me for everything. - Go upstairs, Mary. - I'll tell her.. I don't feel well. I have a pain. I've had it all morning. It hurts. Here. It's a bad pain. I've never had it before. It's my heart. My heart! It's stopping or something. [screaming] Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh, did you hear it? Is it really serious? Is it a heart attack? Uh, telephone Joe and ask him to come over, will you? Oh, my dear. Oh.. I think that the feet should be higher than the head. No, no. Maybe the head should be higher than the feet. Alright, thank you. What is it? Oh, I punished her for playing another trick on your aunt. And she had a sudden pain in her heart. And then she threatened to go home to grandmother with tales of how badly she was treated. Mm-hm, and we could pray that grandma would believe her and take her away. - Oh, Martha. - Hm? Martha, do you think we could get rid of Mrs. Mortar? It's awfully hard having her around with the children. And we could afford to support her now. I know. I know. I'll talk to her today. She'd like a trip to England. Did you get Joe? He was already on his way over. Isn't he always on his way to see you? And I hope he always will be. When we're married this summer, we'll-- This summer? Is it.. Is it so soon? So soon as all that? Why, what's the matter, Martha? Nothing. I'm just tired. Sorry. [car honks] Oh, there is Joe now. Oh, my dear. My dear. Oh.. Oh. Oh. uh, t-t-try it here. - Where? - Here, here. Here, here. - There? - Y-yes, there, there. - A-a most important spot. - Ah. Oh, yes. Y-yes indeed. Oh, when Delia had that attack, this is the spot. - Uh, did this Delia survive? - Oh, yes. I saved her. Ah. Well then, perhaps you.. I was practically put out of the room. So, you don't resent your aunt being snubbed and humiliated? Oh, Aunt Lily. I, who have worked my fingers to the bone here. Don't tell yourself that too often. You'll come to believe it. To the bone, to the very bone. Aunt Lily.. You've wanted to go to London for a long time. It's been twenty years. I shall never live to see it again. But you will. You can go now. I can spare the money and.. So, you want to get rid of me? Turning me out! And at my age. Oh, how can anyone deal with you? You've been talking about going for years. Now when you can go-- Please do not raise your voice. I refuse to be shipped off to England. Next season, I shall go back to the stage and-- No. I'd like you to go sooner. The truth is I don't think the school is quite the place for you. The truth is I should have known enough to stay out of your way when he is here. - When who is here? - Ha-ha! Don't think you're fooling me, young lady. I wasn't born yesterday. I know what I know, and I know how you feel about him. You don't want them to get married and I know why. - Be still. - Oh, I know what's going on. You were never very smart at hiding things, Martha. Why, I know that you're in love with him. Of course, I myself am a little old fashioned. And I-I was shocked when I saw what was going on. Well, I suppose people are like that nowadays. - But why Karen doesn't speak-- - Be still, Aunt Lily! - Be still! These are lies! - You can't.. You can't.. You can't close people's eyes, Martha. The way you used to be running over to his place on any excuse. And, that night when he was coming 'out of your room late, I saw.' There's been no trouble in this house. And I won't let you do your usual job of starting any. I want you to leave as quickly as.. [thudding] Come in. What were you girls doing outside the door? Well, we just came down to see how Mary was. You girls never used to do things like this. I'm afraid we'll have to do something about it. You wait outside, then I'll call you in. - Oh! No. - Oh, Rosalie, I'm so sorry. No, really, really. It's alright. - No, no. - Oh, Rosalie. Really, Miss Dobie, it'll be alright. - I'm awfully sorry. - It's alright. The money is in the bank for you, Aunt Lily. I want you to leave as soon as it's convenient. Do you think I'd take your money? I'd rather scrub floors first. I imagine you'll change your mind. Don't worry about me. I shall be out of here before it's dark. Good day, Joseph. - The Duchess cutting up again? - Yes. She was particularly good today. What about Mary? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I could have managed a more convincing faint when I was six years old. We've about reached the end of our rope with her. Aren't you taking this kid too seriously? Yes, I'm taking everything too seriously. Everything. Everything! - Now wait-- - Oh, please, Joe. Well, the angel child is now putting her clothes on again. The angel child's room-mates were busy eavesdropping outside the door while Aunt Lily and I were yelling at each other. We'll have to separate those girls from Mary. I have a class. They're outside. I'll take care of it. Girls, will you go in, please? Rosalie, Evelyn, come in here, please. Well, how does it feel to be back from the grave? It's my heart and it hurts. Science has failed. - Try a hair brush. - 'Mary.' I want to see my grandmother. We're awfully sorry, Miss Wright. I'm sorry, too, but I'm afraid we have to separate you girls. Rosalie, move into Helen Burton's room. Mary, you can move in with Lois Fisher. And it's all because I had a pain. You're always mean to me, I get punished and picked on and blamed for everything! [muffled screaming] [muffled crying] Go up now, girls, and move your things. [screams] Oh, don't do that. She'll hear you. Who cares if she does? And she can hear that, too! [indistinct chatter] - Did you really have a pain? - I fainted, didn't I? I wish I could faint sometimes. What were you two doing? We heard Miss Dobie and Miss Mortar having an awful fight. A fight? Rosalie dropped a book and there we were. And a lot of crawling and crying you both did too, I bet. What were they fighting about? Miss Dobie wants Mortar to go to England and Mortar got sore at that. And said she knew why Miss Dobie wanted to get rid of her. Oh. - What's the matter? - Nothing. She got her arm caught in the door when Miss Dobie was closing it. Oh, something's always happening to you. Well, I'm gonna start moving my things before Miss Wright comes up. Ah! Go on. Well, Dr. Cardin and Miss Wright are going to get married. Oh, everybody knows that, stupid! But everybody doesn't know that Miss Dobie doesn't want them to get married. How do you like that? Why doesn't she? [humming] Why doesn't she? Because she is in love with Dr. Cardin too. That's why. Go on. [Evelyn] 'And Mortar said she knew it all along.' And then she said an awful lot of funny things about them. All about one night, late when Dr. Cardin was up in Miss Dobie's room. What does she mean, I wonder? [instrumental music] It's a shame we have to move. I've got to go in with Helen. And she blows her nose all night. - Lois told me. - A dirty trick. Dobie just wants to see how much fun she can take away from me. - She hates me. - No, she doesn't, Mary. She treats you just like the rest of us. - Almost better. - That's right. Stick up for your crush. Take her side against mine. - I didn't mean it that way. - Oh! - You'd better start moving. - I'm not going anywhere. - I'm going home. - What? - I'm going home. - Why, you can't do that. Can't I? You just watch and see. They can't treat me like this and they don't have to think they can. And your grandmother will send you right back. - What are you gonna tell her? - Oh, I'll think of something. I can always do it better on the spur of the moment. You better stop talking silly and get your things moved. I'll go through the field at French's. How are you gonna get to a street car from there? Taxi, idiot. Got any money? Not me. Not a cent. I need some money to get home. You've got two dollars and 25 cents. Go and get it for me. No, I won't go get it for you. Go get it for me. I won't, I won't! You took it from me last time. It took me so long to save it. Go get me that money. I won't, I won't, I won't! [screams] Ah! That's my sore arm! Don't! Children, children. What are you making such a fuss about? I am most upset today with all my packing and my moving. 'I cannot stand this noise.' I shall have a headache. That's what I'll have. [gasping] What were you girls doing? Of course, it's not any business of mine any longer what you're up to. Isn't that Helen's bracelet? The one that was lost. - Uh.. - No, ma'am. It's Rosalie's bracelet. Here, Rosalie. You dropped it. I cannot stand this noise. In my day, children were seen and not heard. Try and be ladies. Now will you give me the money? Come on. [engine revving] I don't see why I have to come with you. I'm not going in. I want to go back to school. Oh shut up. You think I wanted you with me? I just knew you'd go and blab to everybody about your old arm. Go on. Go on in there. I don't know where grandma is, and be quiet. Well. May I ask why you aren't in school? You look like a pig. - Where have you been? - Where is grandma? Where should any clean person be at this time of day? She's taking a bath. What did you come home for? Leave me alone. I came home because I didn't feel well. You don't feel well. Can't you feel bad in your own coat? Now you come right on upstairs and see your grandmother. If you're so sick then you don't mind some medicine. A good dose of rhubarb and soda will fix you up. And don't let her tell you she's sick. - Mary. - She is no more sick than.. Oh grandma, I couldn't help it. I had to come. I just had to. I was so sick for you. [chuckles] Well, I'm glad that's all it is. - You said she was sick. - I said she wasn't sick. I bet she only came for Wednesday night fudge cake. Do you mean you left without permission? I couldn't help it, grandma. I couldn't. I ran away. I had to. Now, that was a very bad thing to do. Agatha, phone Miss Wright and say that John will drive Mary back. No! Grandma, don't do that. Please don't do that. Grandma, please! They-they'll kill me. I can't go back. I can't. They'll kill me, grandma. They will, they will! - Mary-- - If you're going to let he-- Whatever makes you say such things? It's true. Honest, honest. - I fainted today. - 'Fainted?' Yes. My heart, I had a pain in my heart. And Dr. Cardin said I didn't have any pain. And I'll bet he was right. Well, have you still got the pain? Well, I guess I haven't got it much anymore. - But I feel a little weak. - Careful. Little girls often have pains but they don't need to mean heart trouble. Now John will drive you back after dinner. After dinner? Maybe I could stay till Saturday? It's your birthday! We don't celebrate my birthday anymore. [chuckles softly] How much do you love me? As much as all the words in all the books in all the world. Remember when I was little and you used to tell me that right before I went to sleep? Oh, I miss you so much, grandma. Couldn't I stay here for the rest of the term? And then maybe I wouldn't mind going back so much. Oh, back you go tonight. And remember, no more running away from school. Ever. - Then I really have to go back? - Of course. You don't love me! You don't care what happens to me! - Mary! - You don't, you don't! You don't care whether they kill me or not! [crying] But I do care that you're talking this way. I'm sorry, grandma. Forgive me. What made you talk like that? Because I'm scared, grandma. I'm scared. They've got something against me and they punish me for everything. Today, they even said I couldn't go to the boat races. [chuckling] Oh, really. But it's not just that, grandma. It's things. Other things. Funny things. What nonsense are you talking? They've got secrets, grandma. Funny secrets. What about Miss Dobie and Dr. Cardin And Mrs. Mortar told Miss Dobie that she knew what was going on. - What? - That she knew.. What was going on and she'd always known about what was going on. Stop using that silly phrase, Mary. But that's what she kept using, grandma. And Miss Dobie said she'd have to get out of the house. And-and that's why we had to move our rooms I bet. Because they're frightened we'll hear things too. Well, I don't know what you're talking about but I don't think I like it. If anything puzzled you, you should have gone to Miss Wright or Miss Dobie. But they would have punished me more and more and more. I guess they knew about how I couldn't help hearing about that awful night that.. - What awful night? - Well.. Dr. Cardin was in Miss Dobie's room late and.. Other times when things happened, too, but.. I-I can't say them out loud, grandma. I.. - I've got to whisper it. - Nonsense! - Why must you whisper? - Because I've got to. Because it's bad. Well, it was late at night and Miss Dobie's room was next to ours and.. Mary! Do you know what you're saying? - Are you telling me the truth? - Honest, honest. And today there was an awful row. And Mrs. Mortar said that they were putting her out because she couldn't be fooled. 'And she knew about the things that were happening' 'about Dr. Cardin and Miss Dobie.' 'And Miss Dobie got awfully angry at that' and said she had to get out right away and.. It was things like that all the time. Mrs. Mortar said that that's why they were putting her out. How do you know what Mrs. Mortar said? Because Rosalie and Evelyn heard them. And Miss Dobie got mad when she found out that they had heard and-and she was so mad, she.. She took Rosalie's arm and hurt it bad. - She did what? - Wait a minute, grandma. Come here. Hold this. Hold this! [gasps] What are you doing? What? Stop it.. Shut up. But.. Will you stand still! Come on. - See, grandma? - Why, Rosalie-- - See how they hurt her arm? - Rosalie, what-- I had to bring her with me because they hurt her arm so. See? Oh, I'm sorry, Rosalie. Does it still hurt you? Yes, Mrs. Tilford. But Mary, she.. Rosalie, is your mother still in New York? Yes, Mrs. Tilford. Then you will stay here till she returns. Now run along. Get ready for dinner. Grandma. Do I have to go back to that awful place? No. You won't have to go back. - Leave it on. - What for? What did you put it on for anyway? Never mind. Leave it on. Why? I don't understand what's happening. Aren't we going back to school tonight? Maybe I'm never going back. Well, I wanna go back. Do you know what's happening? Ah, you're always pretending you know everything. Anyway, I don't want anything to do with your silly secret. Oh, well, suppose I told you that maybe you're in on this silly secret? Suppose I told you I may have said that you told me about it? Why.. Mary Tilford. I didn't tell you anything. I'm going right in to your grandmother and tell her I didn't tell you anything. Whatever it is. You're just trying to get me into trou.. Well, why don't you go? Go on. Go ahead. - I'll come with you. - What for? I want to tell her all about this. - What about it? - Just that you stole it. - From Helen Burton. - Shut up! I didn't do any such thing. I found it and I was gonna put it back as soon as I went to the movies. I never meant to keep it. I was putting it back the day when you came in. And who's gonna believe that? I guess I ought to go and tell grandma anyway. And then she can call the police. And you'll spend the rest of your life in one of those solitary prisons. And you'll get older and older and when you're very old they'll let you out. Maybe. With a sign on your back saying you're a thief and you won't have any place to go and you'll beg on the streets. Oh, stop that bawling! You won't tell! Say you won't tell. Please! Maybe. If you'll take the oath. Say from now on, I, Rosalie Wells in the vassal of Mary Tilford will do and say whatever she tells me. Under the solemn oath of a Knight. I won't say that! I won't. That's the worst oath there is. - Mary, please don't! - Will you swear it? But then you can tell me to do anything. And you'd have to do it. Say it quick or I'll.. From now on, I, Rosalie Wells in the vassal of Mary Tilford 'and will do and say whatever she tells me' 'under the solemn oath of a knight.' [Rosalie crying] Mrs. Mund, please. This is Mrs. Tilford. Miriam? This is Amelia Tilford. I have something to tell you. Something.. Very shocking, I'm afraid. It's about the school. About Mary and Evelyn. [mellow music] Aren't-aren't we coming back soon? I mean, all the girls are going home and.. It's all so funny. Go ahead, Joyce. Your mother wants you to hurry. I'm sorry to go. We're sorry, too. Goodbye. Now, uh.. Mrs. Walton says would you have Joyce's trunk ready tomorrow and I'll come and pick it up. And she says I'm to pay you right now for the rest of Joyce's term. - 'How much will that be?' - You can tell Mrs. Walton.. We don't want her money or anyone else's. Until we know why all this is happening. Don't get mad at me, lady. You don't have to take the money if you don't want it. It ain't my fault. All I know is what I hear. And what do you hear? Well, that.. It seems that, uh, Mrs. Tilford, uh.. Has, uh, found out about, uh.. Mrs. Tilford? Found out about what? Well, uh, it seems as if, uh, one of you ladies has been, uh.. Uh.. Carrying on with the other's fiance. And she don't think it's a fit place for kids to be. What are you saying? What are you saying? There, there lady. It's got nothing to do with me. If you ask me, it ain't none of the old lady's business what goes on after the kids are asleep. [Joseph] 'Get out!' Get out of here, quick. Oh, don't cry. Please. I know. I heard it. Don't, darling. What's happening to us? What are they doing to us? We're being kicked around by crazy people. Kicking you two around most. Nobody is going to do that to us. Ever. Nobody, my darling. Ever. Come on. We've got a fight on our hands. It's got to be the best fight we know how to make. Here. Let's get on. [Amelia] 'I don't think you should have come here, Miss Wright.' I was coming to see you tomorrow to explain my position in all this and.. To ask you to explain yours. I am deeply sorry that you had to be involved in this. I think we'd better understand each other. There is nothing for us to explain and I very much dislike your sympathy. So you don't think we should have come? What were we expected to do, Mrs. Tilford? Lie down and grin till you'd finished kicking us around with these lies? And that's why I think you shouldn't have come. No amount of words that we can throw at each other, Dr. Cardin can do any of us any good now. Can do any of us any good? Listen. Listen, you're not playing with paper dolls. We are human beings, see. It is our lives you are fooling with. Our lives. That's serious business to us. - Can you understand that? - I understand that. And I understand a great deal more. You have been playing with a lot of children's lives. And that's why I stopped you. I think I know how you must feel. You don't know anything about how I feel. You can't know how any of us feel. One gets lost trying to fight a lie. - Very lost. - I did what I had to do. Whatever went on in your school may possibly be your own business. It becomes a great deal more than that when children are involved. But it's no true! Not a word of it is true. Can't you understand that? We are standing here defending ourselves against what? Against nothing. Against a great, awful lie. I'm sorry that I can't believe that. But you can believe this. We happen to be people who've worked hard for what we've got. You wouldn't know about that. That school meant things to us. It meant self-respect and bread and butter and honest work. And now it's gone. There must be something we could do to you. Something that would make you feel the way we do tonight. Don't get the idea we'll let you whisper this lie. You made it and you'll come out with it. And we'll make you come out with it in a courtroom. Tomorrow Mrs. Tilford, you will have a libel suit on your hands. - That will be very unwise. - Very unwise for you. It's you I'm thinking of. It was wrong of you to brazen it out here tonight. It would be criminally foolish for you brazen it out in public. It's already quite public, Mrs. Tilford. Five hours ago we had our lives decently to ourselves. Now we have nothing left but the dirt you've made of us. Or the dirt you've made for yourselves. Clean your house, Miss Wright. And in time, count yourself very lucky. 'I know those are easy words for me to say' and hard for you to take, but someday you will know what they mean. You've understood nothing. Nothing. These are my friends and when we clean house the three of us can clean it together. Perhaps we should clean your house for you, Mrs. Tilford. - Where is Mary? - Under no circumstances.. 'I would not allow that.' So that's really where you've got it? We couldn't believe it. She's a bad girl, your Mary. - She always has been. - I won't have any more of this. All I wanted was to get those children away. That has been done. You've been in my house long enough. Get out. [Karen scoffs] The wicked very young and the wicked very old. Let's go home. When three people come to you with their lives spread out on a table for you to cut to pieces.. ...then the only honest thing to do is to give them one last chance to come out alive. We want that last chance. If you're honest, you'll give it to us. Where is Mary? Very well. I want to tell you something, Mary. Everybody lies all the time. Sometimes they have to and sometimes they don't. I've lied for a lot of different reasons myself. But there never was a time when if I'd had a second chance I wouldn't have taken back the lie and told the truth. You're a lucky girl Mary, because we're giving you that second chance. Were you telling your grandmother the exact truth about.. - About us this afternoon? - Yes, Dr. Cardin. Remember, you're not going to be punished. You didn't.. You didn't make a mistake, did you? Oh no, Dr. Cardin. We're not finished, Mrs. Tilford. Mary, why don't you like Miss Wright and Miss Dobie? Oh, I do like them. They just don't like me. They're always punishing me. For everything. Tell your grandmother why you were punished today, Mary. Just because Rosalie and Evelyn heard things. And you took it out on me. That isn't why the reason you were punished. What things, Mary? Mrs. Mortar was telling Miss Dobie that she knew what was going on. And she knew what Miss Dobie felt about you. 'And things that had happened.' My aunt's a stupid woman. What she said was unpleasant. It was said to annoy me. It meant no more than that. What do you think Mrs. Mortar meant by that, Mary? I don't know. But funny things did happen. And then she said things about the times when you'd come at night and we'd listen. - And I'd get frightened. - Oh, be still. No, no. You don't want her still now. Go on Mary. What did you see? What did you hear? I don't know. There were just things. What things? I don't know. But I saw plenty of things. We all did. And that's why Rosalie got her arm hurt, grandma. - What? - 'Go on, Mary.' And one night you were in Miss Dobie's room late. Why did you think it was wrong for me to be in Miss Dobie's room? Be-because.. Because it was at night and I leaning down by the keyhole and I saw things and.. I got scared and then you left and.. And.. A-ask her again how she could see us? I was leaning down by the keyhole. There's no keyhole on my door. What? There is no keyhole on my door. It wasn't her room, grandma. It was the other room. I guess she was in Miss Wright's room. She was there. [Joseph] 'How did you know anybody was in Miss Wright's room--' I told you. I told you! Because we heard you. I heard you! My room is on the first floor at the other end of the house. It's impossible to hear anything from there. What is this, Mary? Why did you say you saw through the keyhole? - Why-- - Everybody's yelling at me! And I don't know what I'm saying when everybody messing me up! Oh I did see them! I did see them! I want the truth, so help me. All the truth, whatever it is. We've finished here. We've cleaned your house for you. - We can go home now. - No. Please. Wait a minute. Stop that crying! I want the truth. Alright. What is the truth? It was Rosalie who saw them. I just said it was me so I wouldn't have to tattle on Rosalie. You ask Rosalie. You just ask Rosalie. - She told us all about it. - Rosalie. Rosalie. You deserve whatever you get, Mrs. Tilford. I don't know. I don't. Come dear, I.. I.. Rosalie. Come dear, sit down. Rosalie, Mary tells me there's been a lot of talk at the school about.. About Miss Dobie and Dr. Cardin. Is that true? Uh.. I don't know what you mean. What was the talk about, Rosalie? Why.. - I.. - Don't be frightened. I don't know what Mrs. Tilford means. Rosalie. Mary has told her grandmother that.. Certain things at school have been.. Puzzling you girls. You particularly. History puzzles me. I guess I'm not very good at history and Helen helps. No. No Rosalie, that's not what she meant. She says that you saw.. Certain, certain acts between Miss Dobie and Dr. Cardin that-that weren't quite right. Oh, Miss Wright. I didn't. I didn't. I never said any such thing. I never saw any such thing, ever. Rosalie, what's the matter with your arm? Yes, why, did you say then, Rosalie that Miss Dobie injured your arm when when you overheard a fight between her and-- - What? - But I didn't, Mrs. Tilford. I.. I mean, the door slammed. But that wasn't what.. I never said that. - I never saw anything. - Mary! Oh, yes, you did too. You told me about your arm. You told us about what you saw. You are just trying to get out of it. I remember when you said it. I remember it because it was the day Helen Burton's bracelet-- I never did. I.. It was the day Helen Burton's bracelet was stolen. And nobody knew who did it. And Helen said that if her mother found out she'd have the thief put in jail. There is nothing to cry about, Rosalie. You must help us by telling the truth. That's all. Grandma. There is something I've got to tell you. Yes. Yes! I did say it! I told Mary. What Mary said was right. I said it. I said it! I said it! Oh! [Rosalie bawling] [crowd clamoring] [gavel bangs] I cannot but agree with the verdict the jury has brought in. And to add here a few words of my own. 'I feel strongly that this case never should have been' 'brought into court. At best.' 'Slander cases are slim and dangerous suits.' But in this instance, it has been shameful to witness the spectacle of two innocent children 'dragged day after day through a story' 'they never should have known at all.' [clamoring] [gavel bangs] "Slander suit against Amelia Tilford. "Brought by Joseph Cardin, Karen Wright "Martha Dobie is dismissed. Plaintiffs to pay costs." [crowd applauding] [clamoring] [dramatic music] [mellow music] [rain pattering] I don't have to tell you either how much we valued having you here how much your skill has meant to us. Yes, thanks. I'm very tired of speeches. I understand my name has been in the paper and.. All my work here, that's-that's gone. They've forgotten about that. Now, now doctor. Don't feel that way about it. There are lots of other places. Are there? Thanks. [engine revving] Well, now you see on a day like this I'd get the charge eight dollars 'as I figure the rain ain't doin' the car no good' and these side curtains will cost-- My bag, please. Lady, you use more gas when it's rainin' and another thing I got to figuring the wear and tear on top of the car. Very vulgar to be so concerned about money. I pity you. You can charge this. My niece will pay you tomorrow. Yoo-hoo. Woo-hoo. - I'm here, I am. - The Duchess. Returned at long last. Hello, hello, hello. We are delighted to see you. And I am so glad to see you both. I'm so glad to see the old place again. A dreadful weather, isn't it. And ho-how is everything? Everything is fine and we're splendid, thank you. - Where have you been? - Uh.. Around, around. I had a most interesting time. Why didn't you answer our telegrams? You should see the change in the theater. Drastically changed, I might-- Why didn't you answer our telegrams? Oh Martha, there's your temper again. Don't bother about my temper but answer me. Well, I was moving around a great deal. You know a great many of the newer theaters now have fully equipped bathrooms backstage. And is that why you refused to come back and testify for us? Oh, now, that's the wrong way to look at it. I didn't refuse, but we were putting on a new play. And the curtain must go up. Now, now, now. Let's not talk about this anymore. I'll go upstairs and unpack. Things have changed here, you know. She doesn't know, she very carefully waited until the whole thing was over. Listen, we've been trying for months now to defend ourselves in a courtroom Against the lies of a child called Mary Tilford. Oh, what a dreadful girl she is. A great part of the Tilford case Was based on remarks made by Lily Mortar, actress. Against her niece. That's me. And a greater part of the case rested on the telling fact that Mrs. Mortar would not appear in court to deny or explain those remarks. As you probably read in the papers, we lost the case. But it couldn't have done any good for all of us to get mixed up in this.. This-this unpleasantness. Oh, but now that I'm here, I'm gonna stand shoulder to shoulder with you. 'I'm going to help all that I can.' There's a 4 o'clock train. Get on it. Martha. You've come back here to pick the bones dry. Well, there aren't even bones anymore. When you wish to apologize I shall be temporarily in my rooms. Oh. Well. Well, look who's here. Little late, aren't you? Well, I call that loyal of you, Karen. Lots of women would have felt very differently. Get out of here! [mellow music] Apologizing for my aunt is like.. ...apologizing for an earthquake. And just as silly. Don't let her worry you this time. We'll give her some money and get rid of her. Tired? Were you busy at the hospital? Yes. I was very busy. - 'Hungry? Would lunch help?' - Uh-huh. - With biscuits? - Lots of 'em. Darling. We're going away. We're going to Vienna. I've cabled Fisher and he says I can have my old job back. It will be nice seeing it again. The hospital and the dirty little tobacco shop next door. and the cake shop with the fat girl next door to that. I used to go there every day at four o'clock for coffee. You don't want to go to Vienna. No. No, I don't want to go to Vienna. I'd rather have stayed here. You don't want to go to Vienna. You'd rather have stayed here but we can't stay We've got to start over and start quick with all this far behind us. Darling... we'll start over again. All three of us. - What's the matter? - Nothing. - Oh yes there is. - No, it's nothing. Nothing. - What did you do just then? - I didn't do anything. I.. Something you've never done before. - It's nothing, nothing at all. - Karen, what's wrong? Everything we do, everything we say to each other seems to mean something else. Look at me. Your face is the way it was that last day in court. Ashamed. And sad at being ashamed. What is it? I don't know. I just don't know whether people can start again. Karen, we've got to face this. Say it now. Ask it now. I've nothing to ask. Nothing. Alright. Were you.. Were you and Martha ever.. No. Karen, Martha and I have never even thought of each other. Don't you believe me? People can't believe just because other people tell them to believe. Well, that child certainly did a good job on the three of us. If only we could take back these months. Take them back and forget them. Look, we are standing here. We haven't changed. Our hands are just the same. My face is just the same. Even my dress is old. We're in a room we've been in so many times before. It's nearly time for luncheon. We're like everyone else. We can have all the things that everyone has. We can have a house, we can sit in the sun we can walk together, we can be together always. If only we can take back these months. Go to Vienna, Joe. I can't go with you now. - Karen. - No. Words are no good now. They won't do us any good. I'll always love you. If you can ever believe in me again.. ...I'll be waiting for you. [mellow music] Goodbye, my love. [crying] Cooking always makes me feel better. Where's Joe? Gone. He'll be back for lunch? He-he won't be back anymore. You mean he won't be back anymore today? - He won't be back at all. - What's happened? What's happened? Karen? Whatever has happened concerns me too. I told him that I thought that.. You.. And he.. No. No, you couldn't have. You couldn't have thought that. Didn't he tell you it wasn't true? Yes. He told me. Joe! Joe! Don't do that. [rain pattering] You didn't believe him. I don't know what I believe anymore. Things can't be like this, Karen. - It isn't true. You can't thi-- - Oh, it's beyond that. Don't talk about it anymore. You thought that for all these months? And yet you stood by us. You've been a good friend, Karen. "Clean your house", she said. Well, let's finish cleaning it. It makes no difference now. We might as well pull all the pieces down. I do love him. I've always loved him. He never knew about it. He never even thought about me. I think I've loved him since the first day we came here. There it is, Karen. That's all of it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for all of us. Can't you believe me now? It's strange. He asked me the same thing. [dramatic music] Well I'll be going now. The four o'clock train. Get on it. Wait a minute. I'll be going with you. [train chugging] [indistinct chatter] You have a nice nature, Martha. It's a wonder you could ever bear to look at a child again. Although I suppose they are not all like Mary Tilford. I tell you when I read what those girls 'said about you right in the courtroom, I--' Aunt Lily, I don't want to talk about it. Now or ever. Oh, but you'll be thinking about it. I know. Well, I always knew about that child. I saw through her from the very first. Of course, if I'd been allowed to stay on. Oh well. [clicks tongue] Oh, the things that girl used to do. Deceiving me with those flowers. Late for breakfast every day with some new lie. Bullying the other girls. Why, she had little Rosalie Wells right under her thumb. Aunt Lily, let's not go into it anymore. Why, she used to make that child do terrible things. I never thought about it much at the time. But I believed for months she made Rosalie steal Helen Burton's bracelet. Anyway, that day I was asked to leave they were acting very strangely about it. And the way she said in court that you would hurt her arm. 'Why, I saw with my own eyes how Mary hurt her arm.' Of course I never connected all this but you can't fool me for long. I just bet that was Helen Burton's bracelet that day and that Mary.. When is your next stop? [intense music] [instrumental music] - Hello, Rosalie. - Miss Dobie. - I want to see your mother. - What? What do you want.. What do you want to see my mother for? She's out, Miss Dobie. She won't be in. I'll wait for her inside, Rosalie. I have plenty of time. We used to be friends, didn't we Rosalie? I don't want to frighten you now. You see, I've just found out some things and I.. - I want to ask your mother-- - She's not in. She won't be back. What are you going to ask her? Please. Please don't do that, Miss Dobie. Please don't go and see my mother. Come here Rosalie. Why did you say I hurt your arm when it was really Mary Tilford who did it? And what's all this about a bracelet and.. I-I didn't. I never meant to. I didn't.. Rosalie, someday when you're grown up you'll know what it is to have something mean your whole life to you. That's the way I feel now. And you're the only one who can help me. Please help me, Rosalie. Please. Yes, Miss Dobie. I did it. I did it. I never meant to. She made me do it. She made me do it. She told me they'd put me in jail. I took it but I never meant to keep it. And the day we had to go to that court.. [crying] ...she came over when I was eating my breakfast and told me that you had the policemen all ready to take me. 'And that if I didn't tell all about the arm and things' 'that the judge would put me in jail.' [sobbing] Because she would give them the bracelet. She made me do it! She made me do everything! Grandma, don't believe her. Don't believe a word she said. She's just trying to get out of it. She's making it all up. She lies all the time. Everybody knows she does. Grandma, don't believe her! You heard what she said to.. It was hidden in her bureau behind a book. Grandma. She's just trying to blame it on me! - She's just trying to blame-- - Girl! All my life, the mistakes I have made have been honorable ones. You have made me make the first that was dishonorable. Take her upstairs. Lock her door. Come here, come here. Yours. Your very own. To live with the rest of your life. There won't be a word she says or a move she makes 'that won't frighten you.' Yes. And that will be my punishment. Go home now, Rosalie. Don't be afraid of anything again. I'll speak to your mother for you. John will drive you home. Goodbye, Miss Dobie. Goodbye, darling. Miss Dobie. There's no way I can take back what I have done to you. But what little I can do. A public apology. The damage suit to be paid in full of course and...whatever else you would be kind enough to take from me. So I'm to help you with your conscience, am I? You've done a wrong and you've to right that wrong so you can rest your head again. A public apology and money paid. That will be peace for you. That's very neat, Mrs. Tilford. But there won't be peace for you. In the end, I think you will be punished most. - I'm sorry for that. - Oh, that doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is you. I'll be alright. Quite alright. But let me try to help you. Let me do what little I can. Help me? No. But I want to send a message to Karen. And I want you to take that message. Tell her to stay with Joe, wherever he is. Tell her I said that. She'll know what I mean. Goodbye. She said, "Tell Karen to go to Joe wherever he is. Tell her when that happens, I'll be alright." She said you would know what she meant. Yes. I know what she meant. [upbeat music] Tobacco shop, cake shop, hospital. Tobacco shop.. Cake shop, hospital. [instrumental music] [speaking in foreign language] Yeah, yeah.
