[LAUGHING] Don't judge a book by its cover. I thought you liked these. You were anxious enough to get them off. I should have had them bronzed. You're playing dirty. Well, I ain't playing dead. I think if a man has a good reason, he can change his life. Isn't that right? I used to wonder why Cubans had such big families. Lots of tradition, history to pass on. I want that. I want you. I love you. Marry me. Each day I think things will get clearer... and they don't. Can't keep this up, Isabel, back and forth. Your heart's going to get tired one day. It's smarter than you. It needs a rest. Think about it... and say yes. Nobody's loved you like I have. WOMAN: ...reporting this morning from opa locka airport. I am currently waiting, along with many Cuban families, for the arrival of the most recent freedom flight from Havana, Cuba. The flight is reported to be carrying over 40 Cuban political prisoners... WOMAN: My heels are killing me. I should have worn flats. How you doing? [HUMMING] Your little sister's looking so grown-up. Mi Isabel. You know I am behind you no matter what, right Hmm? Ok? Ah, well, this must be a very proud moment for you, Isabel. Estella. Jorge. Maribi, how are you? I am a marked woman. Ay, niña, forget them, eh? It's going to be great. You will see. Great. Oh, Victor. Can I get you something to sit on? A crate or something? No. I want you to think about a house. It's going to make things sweet for you and Nestor. I can make you a great deal. Ay. She's going to start wailing unless she sits. Think about it. Hon, get the girls together. Poor victor. Your sister-in-law, she's a witch, you know? A witch. Mira! Un barco! Un barco! Auxilio! Auxilio! Auxilio! [SPEAKING SPANISH] Starboard! Pull it up! We're coming up alongside you! Take it easy! Senora, estamos aqui para ayudarle. Come on, lady. I want to help you. Lady, esta bien. Ok. Asi, asi. All right. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Maribi. Is she all right? All right. Someone grab her. Maribi. Take it easy, lady. Baby. Baby. Maribi. Somebody get something for these people to drink. [CHEERING] P.A.: The freedom flight from Havana, Cuba, is now landing. [CHEERING] Here it comes! Let me look at you. Come, spit out your gum. [MUSIC PLAYS] Now you look good for Uncle Nestor. He loves you. You're not listening to him. Estoy libre! Miralo. I thought that was him. [CROWD CHANTING] Libertad! Libertad! Maribi. Maribi, that's him! That's papi. Isabel. Maribi. Hello, beans. Do you remember me? She was just a little baby. When you were a baby, I used to call you "beans." You don't remember? Por favor, come with me, señor. Was it a surprise to be released so suddenly, sir? NESTOR: I found out two days ago. Come on, Maribi. Nestor! Oh, I thought I was never going to see you again. You're suffocating your brother. How are they treating the political prisoners in Cuba? [EXCITED CHATTER] P.A.: Su atencion, por favor. Antes de presentarse con un agente de immigracion... What was the term of your prison sentence? It was 20 years. Time served? 8 years. Reason for imprisonment? Writing and passing out leaflets. Were you ever a member of any revolutionary or counterrevolutionary organizations? I am a writer. My father... he participated in the Cuban revolution. What made you change sides? It was the revolution that changed sides, sir. Señor Varona, are you aware that counterrevolutionary groups in this country are working to overthrow the present government of Cuba? Yes. Are you aware that trading in arms, paramilitary training-- any activity relating to military intervention against the government of Cuba-- is in violation of the laws of this country? Yes. I understand that. Do you have plans to join any such organization? My plans are to enjoy my freedom. MAN: You'll be the one supporting him? Yes. Just temporarily. Sign here. Good luck. NESTOR: Maribi, what is this? It's peanut butter. What is this? It's Spam. That's my favorite. What is Spam? I don't know. Nobody knows. Well, if this is your favorite, Beans, tonight we are going to light candles, and we are going to eat Spam until we burst. Ok? [TELEPHONE RINGING] ISABEL: Nestor, please! They're just waiting for you to make a move. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hola. No. You have the wrong number. That was Luis. Hmm? It's time. Tonight we're going to distribute them. I'll be careful. But you have a family. I love you. You love Cuba more. They must already suspect you. They're just waiting for you to make a move. Nestor, please don't. Don't do it. Let somebody else do it. Please! Isabel. [CRYING] Go look at our daughter before you walk out of here. [ECHOING] Go look at our daughter! [SINGING IN SPANISH] Is it what you expected? I didn't know what to expect. They're throwing you a party tonight, and they all put in to pay for the band. He's here! [SPEAKING SPANISH] [CHEERING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Hello. Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! [CHANTING] Come, Maribi. Show me your room. I made room for you in the closet. And you will need these, too. I doubt very much if I'm going to use all of that space. People have been very generous. I hope it all fits. I put you a clean towel in the bathroom. You made this? You are an artist. WOMAN: That's it. That's it. Right over there. Thank you. WOMAN: This is really great. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Adelante! Adelante! Silencio! Apresurense, caminen! [KNOCK ON DOOR] Trousers fit? They're a little loose, but I could take them in. [GASPS] It's-- It's all right. I need a favor, Sam. I want to take a fishing trip to Cuba. I need your boat. I don't need any trouble with the DEA. Not drugs. My brother's wife and kid got out of Cuba and made it to Costa Rica. Come on, you fuck. You know the waters. That's Cuban politics, man. It's worse than drugs. Not politics. Family. Babies. Babies. Ok. We'll talk about it. Angel, coma estas? Aqui. A lot of action today. Everybody is laying their money down on this new greyhound. There's more than one born every minute. Yeah. Ok, Sammy, come on. Let's go. We got 20 minutes to post time. So, lover boy, what's next for Isabel's hero? We don't need to talk about that. Hey. por que no? Huh? She lets him settle in... finds the right time to tell him, she tells him. Uh-huh. And what if he doesn't like what she has to say? [DRUMS BEATING] Marie. Ah, Estella. Smile, mi niña. He's gorgeous. I should be so lucky. Nestor! Nancy, you're suffocating your brother. I'm ok. We bought you some things. Anything you need, you just tell us. We're your family. You shouldn't have done this, Nancy. Look at this that Nancy brought. So sweet. Junior. Junior. Come dance with your mother. Junior. Give that to your father. Why don't you dance with Victor. You can dance. The band sounds good. I'd like to see you dance. Ok. Hold this. It's a video camera. Everybody in america has one. They're great. Nestor, you want a beer? [SINGING IN SPANISH] Name Reuben Casillas mean anything to you? He wants to see you. Reuben is here? The spanish prime minister got him out two years ago. You didn't know? The old dog is fighting like it was 30 years ago in Cuba. Well, you get settled, Nestor. We'll talk. [SINGING IN SPANISH] Nestor. Ay, mira. Come on. I want you to meet my family. We know what you have been through, Nestor, and we are really happy that you are here. Hello. I dreamed you were coming. Mami, look. What do I owe you? This one is on me, Mami. My mother Ofelia Sanchez. Hola, señora. My sister Ana. You look just like Heriberto. My father. He's a political prisoner. Thank you. You have no right to be here. I know. I'm a sucker for roast pig. What have you been drinking? Tequila. Wonderful. Music makes me feel like dancing. Did you tell him I was a good dancer? Please, don't do this to me. Isabel, come on, I just wanted to see how you were doing. I miss you. Oh, Sam. I'm sorry. I have to go. Isabel. Maribi. She's beautiful. She really shined tonight. You know, she's good at school. She helps me in the home. She's my best friend, Nestor... the best child we could have hoped for. Victor tells me that you are thinking about buying a house. Dreaming of one. You can afford it? The down payment. Nobody buys anything cash in this country. Where did you get the money from? My work at the factory, and I bring home piecework. You're a teacher, Isabel. Not here. I'd have to go back to school. And who would look after Maribi? This Estella-- she tells me she's a bookie and that you help her sometimes. Once a week, I drive her for collections. It gives us a chance to talk. You've managed well by yourself. And what about you? I missed you. You still smell the same. I found someone at province headquarters who will speak to the national director. They already freed three prisoners last month. All they had to do is sign up for the rehabilitation program. I have refused the rehabilitation program, Isabel. As of today, my visitation rights have been cut off. You won't be able to see me anymore. I am not going to bow down to them. Oh, Nestor! Please! You know that if you refuse them, they won't let Maribi into school. They'll cut our medicine, our food. They'll take our home. If I let them strip me naked today, Isabel... tomorrow they make me walk on all fours. No. I am not going to wear their uniforms. Oh, Nestor, do anything, say anything just to get out. Maribi and I need you back. I want you and Maribi to try to get to Miami. No! Isabel, there is nothing that you can do. There is no effort that you can make to free me. You free yourself and Maribi. Nestor, don't. You know I love you. Don't go, Nestor! Remember me to Maribi. Please! Don't! Listen to me! Forget me, Isabel. Go. Listen! Go! Nestor! Nestor! [BLOWS WHISTLE] Isabel! Isabel! [TV NEWS IN SPANISH] MARIBI: Want some cereal, Nestor? I mean, papi. Papi? You want Raisin Bran, Mueslix Bran, or all-bran? Which do you recommend? Froot loops? Ok. Oops. You don't like eggs? [SPEAKING SPANISH] I really miss Cuba. Ok, ok. Let's see, let's see. Ok. "4-4-1-8...$750." No? "5-0-8...$300." ¿Nadie? Nobody? Ay, niña. ESTELLA: We gotta stop making Angel richer! This is the same neck as before, but it's a small, so you can take an inch. So, what happened? He saw sam. Eh? I think he knows. Shit. [ARGUING IN SPANISH] Excuse me. Do you have Spam? Spam? That's refugee food! What do you want Spam for? My daughter, she likes it. Hey, you're Nestor varona! Yeah? Papi! Papi! Come here! This is Nestor Varona! Nestor Varona! Oh, my God! Welcome to Little Havana. I am Francisco Lopez. This is my daughter Michele. Mucho gusto. How are you? I'm going to get you a special Cuban coffee. You don't want Spam. What you want is a Cuban sandwich with cheese and jamon serrano. Ok? Here we are. Especially for you, my friend. Michele, he doesn't pay for anything here. I'll do it myself. What is frozen yogurt? Here one day and already talking yanqui. This is the frozen yogurt machine, and it's peach today. You like peach? You like it? No? Not very much, huh? You don't have to eat it if you don't want to. Un sandwich cubano muy especial para ti. Gracias. FRANCISCO: Nice meeting you. Enjoy your freedom, Señor Varona. Come back! Come back! Bye! Ok. Quick! Miguel! Bye! Nestor Varona! Nestor Varona! Ok. On the count of 4, I want you to walk to the center of the floor. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. Go for the circle now. Don't look down. What are you doing chewing gum? Get your hand out of your pocket! You're walking like Frankenstein! Leave your hair alone! What are you doing to my hair, Estella? The best I can. Is it American? Cuban-American. You like it short around the ears, right? Whatever. Ok. It's going to be beautiful. On the count of 3, start dancing! 1, 2, 3! I told myself I would not ask you this for at least a month. My father-- his name is Heriberto Sanchez. He blew up a government building. I didn't know him, Estella. INSTRUCTOR: Estella! Estella! MAN: Nestor, I told you about Reuben. He needs to see you. He's a strong man, but he needs your voice. The whole community needs your voice. It's nothing against you. I don't want this anymore. I don't want a party! You do! You want a party! Maribi! Maribi! I'll be right up. ESTELLA: She's not stupid. She's very tall, but she's not stupid. INSTRUCTOR: 1, 2, 3! 1, 2, 3! Tell Reuben that I will see him. Arrange the meeting. Good. Look familiar to you? [IMITATING ENGINE] The Lentil Express is coming in for a landing. It passes by Mami. It passes by Papi, looking for a place to land. We could land-- no? Nnnnnnnn! You don't remember that? I'm glad that you like lentils. What did Estella and Jorge have to talk about? What everybody has been talking about. Freeing Cuba, huh? No, but their fathers, their sons, their daughters... they're all worried. So they've appointed you official savior, is that it? We both still have family in Cuba, Isabel. You forget that? I never forget family, Nestor. Family always comes first. Does it? May I be excused? Yes, of course. Rinse your plate. [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] I got connections. What are we doing here? Just a quick stop. I want to show you something. So, what do you think? I think you are dreaming. Victor showed you this? No, I found it listed. It's beautiful. [BELL RINGS] [BELL RINGS] Hey, little one. You all right? You hold that rain cloud in any longer, It's going to burst. Hi, Sam! Someone picking on you? All right, let's have a little powwow here, ok? Why don't you tell me what your problem is. Come on, we can figure these things out. We always do. What's the problem? I came to pick you up, Maribi. Go on. Nestor. She's going to need her books. Maribi? Hi. Where's Nestor? How should I know? Maribi, what's the matter? Hmm? I hate you! Maribi! Maribi! Come here! Maribi. Where are you? Maribi. Talk to me. Talk to me, querida. Sam and Nestor both came to pick me up at school. Everybody laughed at me. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, mijita. I love Sam, but he's not my father. How can I make things better for you? Hmm? I want to go away. Where would you go? Someplace. I'd miss you. Can I come, too? Hmm? Poor baby. Poor baby. [SPEAKING SPANISH] ¿Cafe? No. It's late. [DOORBELL] Buenas noches. Jorge, my husband is very tired. Isabel, I invited them here. Gracias. Nestor, Leon cotto. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Juan the photographer. I hope you don't mind a picture or two. I'm going to do some laundry. Sit down. Gracias. Can I get you something to drink? No, thank you. Leon writes for El Mundo. Cubans read Cuban papers. We're talking real influence. JORGE: When you write for El Mundo, you can pick up right where you left off-- denounce Fidel. Your example can be a great influence in the whole community. NESTOR: You think my writing... [BABY COOING] Hello, Beans! "Thousands of political prisoners are being arrested and imprisoned without trial." you found them? "Others are tortured, shot, stabbed, and held in inhuman living conditions." You wrote this? Yes. You know what could happen to you? To us! Look! That is Juan. God, no. It's got to stop! I won't be quiet anymore. I won't be quiet anymore. JORGE: Oh, yeah. He wants to introduce you to some new people. NESTOR: Reuben? What kind of people? Real Cubans, good Cubans-- men like you and me. We do need a change, and I want to continue with my writings. Get out of my home. Isabel. Get out of my home! It's all right, Nestor. Let's go. While you were eating hot dogs on Miami Beach, getting tan and fat, he was rotting in prison! Hypocrites! I cannot stop you from talking to Reuben Casillas in his own home, but I will not have it in my house! Not a second time! I feel just as deeply about the people we left behind, but stay away from Reuben. He's dangerous-- crazy dangerous. Now I'm very clear on where you stand on that subject! What I need to know, Isabel, from you, is how you feel about your husband being back in your life, sleeping there in your bed. This is what I cannot have back in my life! If you join with la causa, then think what will happen to your mother and my parents in Cuba. It costs too much! I did not silence myself or numb my conscience when I was in prison, and I will not be made to do so now! [DOOR SLAMS] Good morning, Nestor. Never forget that I... am Maribi's father. Isabel is my wife. Shit. Seems like you're the one that forgot that. You want a beer? Huh? No. It's bad luck to refuse a man offering you a drink. I am not here to play games with you. Just understand me. Stay away from my daughter and Isabel. Isabel comes to me, and you know that. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here. What the hell did you think would happen when you got back? My life with my family was interrupted, not finished! You had choices to make. One of them involved leaving your family. Is that what you think? And for pride? Because if it wasn't pride, it was stupidity! What the hell do you know about what I went through or why I was separated from my family? To hell with your politics, man! You want to wrap yourself up in a Cuban flag, be my guest, pal! But you nailed your own ass the day you put your family's life on the line. You know how they came to Miami? Did you talk to your wife and child about that? In a raft... that sunk before it got here. If my boat hadn't happened along, they'd have swallowed the ocean. That's right. You know how hard it was for a woman with a 2-year-old child, barely spoke the language, working two jobs? She was sleeping on Estella's floor. She was eating fish heads. Fuck you, Nestor. Everybody around here thinks you're a goddamn hero. Not on this boat, you're not. Uh-uh. On this boat, your wife is the hero. And her kid. It seems to me you missed everything important in their lives for eight years. What do you think happens now? My wife... and my daughter... were with me in my cell every night for the last eight years. I've made them suffer. You underestimate my feelings for my family. That's a mistake. JORGE: There's going to be a rally for my organization. I want you to speak. The Soviets... the Soviets can't afford to support a hard-liner like Fidel. The time to act is now. Reuben, this is... Cuba is like a fortress. You can't really believe this will change things. Nothing else will! Letters? Protests? Any diplomacy with Fidel is worthless now. It was talks that got me out of prison, not this. Talks! You can't talk to that bastard! This is what he will listen to. Nestor, your father was a brave man. He knew that sometimes you have to take up arms for what you believe. There's people in Cuba ready to fight for us. There's even people here who believe that we can make a difference. People here? They're using you. They need us. We also need brave men, willing. Your words will reach them, incite them. You're dreaming, Reuben. Follow me. [GATE SLAMS] You're free now. Thousands are still in prison. [SOBBING] Reuben! Nearly there. Now look. Wow. Home? You like it? Is it really ours? Well, almost. When the bank is finished with the papers. Let's go inside. [GIGGLES] Beautiful porch! Open it! Open it! Spacious living room! Oooh-oooh! Picture window. Oooh-oooh! Open, large dining area. Oooh! [GIGGLING] Modern kitchen. I like it. Your room. How do you know? I don't know. I'm going to go see my room. Oooh-oooh! Woo! Is my father going to live here... or Sam? Oh, Bibi. Come here, baby, now. This is going to be our house, yours and mine. And even if someday there is no papi or no Sam... this will still be here. And whatever happens, you'll always have me, and you'll always have this house. Nothing can change that. That's my promise. Do you believe me? Yes. Can I go look outside at the back yard? Sure. ISABEL: But hurry. We don't want to be late for Ana's party. SERGIO: Damas y caballeros. On behalf of Estella Sanchez and her family, I would like to thank you for attending this very special evening in Ana Sanchez's life. [DANCE OF THE FLOWERS PLAYING] Ahh! When a girl prepares for her passage into womanhood, her 15th birthday marks that transition... as she blossoms from a flower bud into an exquisite rose. NANCY: It's opening. [CROWD GASPS] It's beautiful! SERGIO: Like a clamshell that opens up to reveal the pearl inside, may this night be the first of many special nights for you as a woman, Ana! [SERGIO CONTINUES SPEAKING] [WALTZ PLAYING] [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] SERGIO: Ladies and gentlemen, Cuando Te Conoci. You look perfect. SAM: Maribi, she looks beautiful. Sam, Sam. ESTELLA: What are you doing here? Ana invited me, remember? Yes, but that was before Nestor came home. I thought you would have called in sick today. I'm not that polite. Ana, Ana. Look who's here--Sam. He came especially to see you. You look so beautiful. ANA: Thank you. SAM: And so grown-up. I was dancing with our daughter, but now I would like to dance with my wife. SAM: How are you? How are you, Sam? Good evening, sir. You know Estella's mother? Yes, yes. Thank you. Excuse me. Ciao. ¿Como esta? You have to tell me what you want, Isabel. Because you haven't told me to leave. I-- Did you hear about Felix? 20 grand. How about that? That slug's never won a dime in his life, and now it's 20 grand. Who's this? Angel, this is Nestor. Mucho gusto. We're all proud of you. I'd like to welcome you to the United States of America. So, tell me about Felix. Everybody wins someday. Yeah. Everyone but Felix. The one time he scores, I don't have him betting on a fucking thing. What are you talking about? Your wife and I are old friends. Get your hands off her wrist. Don't touch me, man. Where's your girlfriend? This isn't your concern! Angel-- [WOMEN SCREAMING] JORGE: Stop it! Stop it, Sam! This is not the place! This is not the place! SAML: Isabel! Let go! SAM: All right! Go back and dance! [SPEAKING SPANISH] ANGEL: hey! Tell your girlfriend she better come find me, or I'll find her! Fuck you, too! Come on, come on. Easy! Esta bien. Where's Maribi? Go get the girls. Isabel, are you all right? Estella. Where's Estella? I think she went to the bathroom. [SOBBING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] How could you do something so stupid? Did he hurt you? No. Or Nestor? No. You could have asked me for the money! Or you could have given Ana a less expensive party. I did not spend it on the party. I gave the money to La Causa. For my father. I just wanted my father here with us. [SOBBING] Estella. Oh, Estella. Come here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's ok. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out, Estella. Oh... Oh. Shh. Shh, now. ESTELLA: He's never coming back. Never. Damn it! Goddamn! Goddamn! She went to him! Fuck! Fuck! So you came to say good-bye. I don't even know what's going to happen. Something good, I hope. I've loved you. I'll always love you. Isabel... Goddamn. Wow! VICTOR: Ok, guys. Be good. I'll be right back. ALL: I want to go! NANCY: No, no. Now sit down. He'll be back. Keep still, Bibi, or I'll never finish this. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] VICTOR: Hola. Hola. Victor! Hi. Hi, honey. Can I give you ladies a lift to the rally? Carnival starts right after. We'll be a little tight, but no use taking two cars. Nestor's speaking about 6:00. Oh, Victor. Ok. Nestor's speech. I think you should take a look at it. See you on the bridge. [APPLAUSE] REUBEN: We'll all return to Cuba to give it back its freedom and its honor. [CROWD CHEERING] Gracias. Muchas gracias. Gracias. And now... it's time to introduce a true hero, a man many of you know and all of you have heard of. A man with the courage of his beliefs. A man of Cubanos... I give you our compatriota and brother-in-arms... Nestor Varona! [LOUD CHEERING] [RADIO PLAYING CUBAN MUSIC] [CHANGES RADIO STATION] [CHEERING] NESTOR: Whether in La Havana or in Miami, I am Cuban. And though I walk... though I walk Calle Ocho a free man today, my soul will remain imprisoned until every last political prisoner walks along beside me, until Cubans and Cuba is truly free. [CHEERING] NESTOR: Que viva. Now, many of you expect me to speak today of the horrors of Cuban prisons, but you will be disappointed. I am not here to indulge your anger or my own. But we need to turn our anger into action. I know how tempting it is to believe that it is weapons in the arms of the people that can topple a dictator, but we here as exiles need to awaken the international press. We need to arouse the world's human rights community with the weapon that we already possess in this country-- our freedom to speak freely, without fear... and with one unified voice. Cubanos unidos must free Cuba! Cubanos unidos! Most of you know that I have not been long in this country. And I have often felt lost here... alone. So it has been comforting to wear this badge of hero. But I am not a hero. I am a survivor. I am a man who spoke out for something that I believed in. But I am also a man who has not been able to see that my wife and my child have also been scarred, have also suffered. "Have also suffered." And yet there has been no celebration for them. There has been no applause, no honors. I have and will continue to work for freedom and to add my voice to the chorus of Cubans who are outraged by what is happening in Cuba today. [APPLAUSE] But I also have my own family... and I owe them my loyalty, as well. [CROWD SHOUTING] [CHEERING AND BOOING] I will never forget or turn my back on my brothers and sisters in Cuba or any of you here. [APPLAUSE] But for now, for now, I must commit myself to my wife and my child. I hope... to start a new life with them, to be there for them. I feel no shame in that. [APPLAUSE AND BOOS] [CHEERING] Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! You all right? Yes. Fine. I'm fine. [CHEERING] [CUBAN MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING IN SPANISH] [FIREWORKS EXPLODING]
