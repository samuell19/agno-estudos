Hell is fun! -Can we do our business now, Vigen? -Of course [Chuckles] I don't have any other plans Let me tell you this.

Get in the car [Engine starts] So you robbed a bank? Just like that? Wasn't that easy How much money did you steal? The problem is that the money wasn't as much as we expected -It was just 700 million Tomans -That's a lot of money -It's not, sir -That's not even as much as our own money -What do you mean? -It was less than what we had at first They wouldn't give us the money so we had to force them [Cat screams] I don't get it We sold everything we had and gave it to a financial instituion named "Atiyeh" Oh... Atiyeh There are so many cases like you Who gave their money to these instituions to get more profit and now they don't even have their own money -You told them about the benefits and... -It wasn't uncle's fault. He had good intentions They were frauds -What happened? -[Sarcastically] What happened?! You worked so hard for years and gave all the money to those frauds and now they don't give it back to you They will pay us when they have the money How the hell am I supposed to pay for her furniture so that she can get married? She shouldn't get married. She's fine I told you a thousand time that at noon I'm having lunch with my family and I don't answer calls -Listen... -I won't!

What they owe us is more than 730 million Tomans -Do you have any proof of how much they owe you? -No -We can just claim -Why? -You must all have a bank account... -That's what I said [Shouts]: But they led us on and didn't give us any document If I can prove how much it is, are you willing to take your money and go? [All shouting]: YES! -Our money plus our payment for the mission -Alright Bring my money from the car and I'll fix it Kamal! Stop whispering things in my ears!

[Phone rings] [Speaking in Armenian] Yes, everything's going well as planned The judge asked to bring the documents and write the money they owe us. That's it Yes, I take care of it. You go. Write how much money you demand on these papers Hurry up. We're running out of time -What do you mean? -This meeting should end until 8:30 -I have to be home by 9 -What happens if you aren't? Kidnapping will be added to the list of crimes you committed -Kidnapping? -Yes You took me in front of a police officer That officer knew me. He called me by my name -Yeah. Judge Nazi -Yes Be sure that if I'm home by 9, that means nothing happened Or else they will report that I went missing and that officer will identify you Here you are -Where are you going? -To the bathroom! Hello? Hi boss You said I can call you when it's an emergancy We need to change the plan, boss. I just found out the officer knows us all He even knew the judge and said hi to him Yes. When I fainted What? If I kill him they will execute me! How much? If you don't help me leave, 300 million is no good for me OK. You got it, boss Hello? Jackass! I've got 300 million Tomans! This is the case of the bank robbery -Why do you have it? -I'm the judge of this case I do a part of my work at home on the weekends This weekend I chose this case because I felt there are some unusal things in it And I had to find out what Now I get why your boss suggested me I'm sure he knows lots of stuff about me -I have no doubt that he has lots of plans for me -What plans, dear Nazi? Fix our problem first and then worry about that Alright, we get started Open the box so that I can see the money Seriously, you never danced before? Yes of course, you know I was a very different person before the Islamic Revolution -You were one of us then -I'm still one of you Just... Dear judge, look, it's open -That's all you stole? -Yes -And the documents as well -Yeah. All the papers are here Do you know how much the stolen amount was announced? -Yes, 730 million Tomans -No! 40 billion and 730 million Tomans Where did they get 40 billion from? I don't know. That's what they announced. -If we get caught, we have to pay 40 billion Tomans? -Yes -That's a lie I swear... -No it's not Go bring the car Sit behind your desk and deposite the moneys from the accounts to this one Hurry up before I blow you up! That poor guy deposited the money and gave me the receipt I knew you'd betray us, Heshmat! Shut your mouth! I did as he asked me to It was the boss' orders. He said you can have the cash and I take what's in the accounts -It was you, then -That one guy takes 40 billion and we... -Don't judge so fast Control yourself and sit down -Sit the hell down! -OK -Where's the receipt? -Here. I have it 4 billion Tomans was deposited in this part You have 730 million and your boss has 4 billion Tomans And someone that we don't know who they are took 36 billion -You mean boss isn't the one in charge? -That jackass? No There are lots of robbers in this! Let me. I have the report of the crime scene and it might be helpful According to the witnesses, after the robbers left the bank... -What are you doing, Bahrami? -I wanna take back the money They will explode here if they find out, Mr. Bahrami I don't care! It's my responsibility! That's honorable! Fighting against the corruption! If all of our managers were like this, everything would go well in our country. Clap for him. [Crowd Cheering] The main robbery took place here Instead of taking back 4 billion Tomans, The assistant deposited 36 billion Tomans more But don't be afraid. I'm with you Because you've lost money You had a difficult life and maybe that's why you agreed to do this There's something else. I owe you These two papers are precious proof for finding out the truth Thank you so much Now that your problem's solved. Help us out -Fix our problem as well -You want me to calculate how much money the bank owes you -Alright but on one condition -What? All of you, put your gun somewhere no one can touch them Makes sense Some are moody and wanna shoot every now and then! -And they might ruin this -OK That was mine And here's mine I'm fine with it, too. Here's mine -Put that aside! -Put it down! Just give me its loader [Gunshot] I'm sorry... -I swear I don't know why it just shoots! -Give it to me before you shoot again!

He dances well! -No, I meant the boss He's putting us in danger I swear I feel the same way [Phone rings] It's the boss! What's he saying?! Act normal and don't tell him about the things we discussed here He said: Act normal and don't tell him about the things we discussed here OK. Hi boss What's taking so long? The bank announced that 40 billion and 730 million Tomans was stolen I heard that too If I find out who it was, I'll set them on fire! -Guys were so mad -They have the right to be Tell them I'll take care of them For now, divide your shares and hide somewhere I'll figure out what to do later That's not the only problem. The judge knows us now. What if he turns us in? Just give him some money and shut him up! The boss said that if we give him money, he won't cause us any trouble Each of us pays him 5 million Tomans and it's done -We have to pay him 20 million Tomans? -Is it too much? This judge won't cooperate with us easily The boss said it's my job Give me the money and I know how to give it to him -Why you? -Ask the boss -Why? You wanna give it yourself? -No, I just wanna... -I'm sensitive on you wifey! -Don't call me wifey! -Don't call me wifey in front of everyone! -[The Judge]: Ladies and gentlemen! If you're done talking, come here Alright You wrote down how much the bank owes you And these are the dosuments of the bank There are some minor differences between them Like what? You're Kamal Ahmadnia, son of Jamal You wrote that you demand 400 million Tomans plus 110 thousand dollars! -Is that right? -You want it to be wrong? The Atiyeh institution didn't have any currency account They put the dollars in another bank! Another bank isn't related to this robbery -Also, you wrote that you demand 400 million Tomans -That's right That's not right! The bank owes you 65 million Tomans -I swear they changed it! -Don't lie! -Can you prove that? -They changed it. How am I supposed to prove? You claimed this and it's your responsibility to prove it -And you -Vigen Vigen Sardar, son of Sus Masis! Right... [Chuckles] You wrote that you demand 590 million Tomans Yes But according to the bank documents, they only owe you 90 million Tomans I swear I spent the rest of it on bank robbery and kidnapping you! -You spent 500 million on us? Nonsense! -You ate a lot! Who paid for that, huh? -Stop bullshitting! -You drove my cars and ruined them! [Shouts]: They were broken in the first place! I paid a fortune on the bombs. Do you know how much the dynamites cost? [Shocked]: They were real dynamites?! -It was dough but it cost a lot! -What?! -Play dough -Alright! And you... Heshmat Raeesian, daughter of Firooz -Yes? -You wrote that you demand 93 million Tomans, right -Yes. I can show you my... -No need, dear lady With its profit it'll be 94800 or as I round it up to 95 million Tomans Bravo, dear lady! What just happened? You raised her money and for us you lowered it! That's none of my business. It's the bank document -And you, Miss Mina Jani -Jooni sounds better! Alright [Shocked]: You wrote that you demand 600 million Tomans! At least! Girl, you didn't even open an account in the instituion! Shit! Was I supposed to open one? Of course! How did you end up demanding 900 million then?! I didn't demand it. I said I need it! Everything is so expensive nowadays! I thought you were innocent and only dumb! That someone took advantage of your stupidity! But you proved me wrong Now I'm not surprised that you were involved in a robbery! According to the bank document, they only owe you 250 million Tomans in general If you subtract it from 730, 480 million Tomans will be left My advice to you is to give the rest to the charity And don't make yourselves sinners But that's up to you -I'm done here -Sit, judge! I don't agree to this! They took my money -What about the money I spent? -I'm not OK with this either We demand the money and we did something together We have 730 and we're four people -How much would each of us get? -I calculated it a hundred times! 182 and a half million Tomans Excellent! We take it and go Sit down! Hey! -You're a jackass! -I'm not Being a jackass means not standing by your words There are three of us and one of you. We're standing and you're on wheelchair! -I can stand! -Shit! Tell us the sentence, judge. I'll shoot whoever that disagrees I won't interfere in your business anymore! -Tell us if you don't wanna die -You can't harm anyone -Don't test me! -Already did When she accidently shot, everything became clear What? The bullets are fake. They just make a sound! Don't move! He's playing with us! Why don't you test it? -You asked for it! -Put that damn thing down! -Don't worry, lady. Nothing happens. -What if it does? It won't. Let him do it Kamal -That's so romantic! -Ugh! [Shouts]: Kill me first! -I won't let it -Alright! Have fun flying y'all! Bye! -You asked for it! -Yeah I'm asking for it! Shoot! I will! [Gunshot] [Gunshot] Boss! You lied about everything! You lied about the money and the bullets. How should I know you're telling the truth about the 300 million ? I will pay you 400 or even 500 million. Kamal, don't let him leave that cafe alive! You're just talking about it Don't be an idiot! If I told any of those three to do this, they would Deposite 500 million to my account or leave it to those who'd do it for you! You know what, boss? I'm out! That guy is nice. I don't wanna be responsible for killing him Got it? Bye These documents are a big clue for an embezzlement that a lot of people are involved in That 40 billion Tomans is just a red herring I think the purpose of bank robbery was bringing these documents out That's why all of our lives are in danger You and me It's better to end it quick and hide somewhere they can't reach you I agree If each of us takes what we demand, 480 is left We do as you say, judge I agree, too. Let's end this game, Nazi! I'm so stressed out! No honorable judge can decide what some robbers should do! It's really strange! I can do one thing I can figure out each of your punishments And you can calculate your shares from what's left according to that It means whoever committed more crime has more punishments? Bravo So whoever committed more crime has a bigger share of money, right? Bravo Now, each of you, tell me what you did so that I can tell your punishment We start from you, lady -Me? -Yes. Go on Um... To be honest, I'm the only one with a criminal record I used to do bag robbery for 20 years Actually, being a thief runs in our family! -[Singing] -That's amazing, mom! [All singing] Ezzat, Shokat, Nosrat and I have been working together for years My dad loved boys and we were all girls so he named us after boys! He tried to raise us like men and he did except for one of us, Behjat Don't annoy her. She didn't sleep till the morning. Go do your work -OK mom -Take care Goodbye You ready? Let's go Every morning, we'd come out and go to crowded places -In the neighbourhood, they call us... -Greetings to The Doltons Aunties! Let's not talk about how we ended up with that nickname! We had some moral rules, we wouldn't rob the kids or the elderly Or the ill people If we'd find an ID or credit card, we'd post them to their owners Our dad had made a will for us not to put our money in the banks. He said they're loan sharks! He believed being a robber is way more moral than that Things were going well up to a few years ago But credit cards were placed in people's pockets instead of cash -And ruined our business -It's not working -We try so hard and get nothing out of it -I second that Let's change our way and do something better before it's too late What else can you do except for robbing? -What about Behjat?What was she capable of? -She's right. You rest for a while She's right, sis. Let's all gather around and learn from her And then we'll be digital robbers! -Exactly. What does she have that we don't? -A brain! Instead of saying these nonsense, use the money you have You can stay in the house and live like princesses! Brother, please don't talk about the banks and the profits in this house! -My late husband's soul will curse you! -Sit down What are you saying, mom? Dad's words were for the time when banks' money wasn't legit It's all clean now! -Can't you shut your mouth?! -Why should we hide our money in our pillows?! We wanna keep them from being robbed but after a while, our money is worthless Our money is becoming less and less precious and no one complains about it My dearest, do whatever you want with your money But don't invest it in banks. I won't be able to answer to your late father Isn't Behjat his daughter, too? -Yes -Bravo! Then why don't you ask her from where she takes her money and spends it? Exactly. Behjat works with a computer for 2 hours and earns a lot of money Hey! What's wrong with you? You're jealous of your own sister?! I don't know what she's up to but I'm sure she has nothing to do with banks and... My dear sister! Banks aren't that bad. You've been hung up on your late husband's will for 20 years! If he'd know that banks are gonna give people 23 percent profit, he'd open an account! -[Shocked]: Uncle! 23 percent? -Yes yes! Wow! That'd be a lot! [Whispers]: Damn Satan... Take it all out The Dolton Aunties gathered all their money and I took it to Atiyeh institution That was the biggest mistake of my life I should've never given up on my late father's will Alright -Now, you go on -What should I say? I was a criminal my whole life! [Bluffing]: Heshmat used to steal bags but I used to steal bags and their owner! I've worked with my uncle since I was 6 He was executed 7 years ago and I took his place We'd mainly mug people. Not only in Tehran but in the whole country Right when we were developing our business, my uncle was gone I took his place. I put a knife on people a lot of times! Sometimes we'd get caught and we had to hit them so hard The smallest crime I committed was robbing the bank! -[Shouts] -Let go of me! -Now do whatever you wanna do! -Calm down, sir! -[Screans] -Oh God! You jerk! You faint everytime you see a police officer and now you claim you were a badass mugger?! I didn't say I'd mug the police! Judge! He's just making a scene to make himself look like a real criminal! The bigger the crime, the bigger your share of money, right? Don't interfere in this For now, we're just gonna listen. Do you have anything else to add? I don't know what you're saying. I just wanna talk to you in private Alright, I'll listen. Let's go Let's go over there When it's my turn, I wanna talk to Mr. Judge privately as well! Privately? With the judge? No freaking way! He said that a few drops of it would kill you At first, I accepted to do this. I swear I need the money But when I saw how nice you are, I refused to do it He said he'd kill me but I said I don't care! But, judge... You know what? He said he'd have someone else do it I thought I should tell you this I knew it. I knew he had plans for me Yes? You are? -The Boss -Which boss? -How many bosses are there? -Lots of them, sir! Idiot! I'm the boss; don't you get it? -Your boss! -Wow! -Is this really you, boss? -Yes. Now shut up and listen Sure. I swear my heart's about to pop out! Listen carefully. I'm about to tell you something important Anything you say is important! Just tell me -I know that you love to go abroad -Not just anywhere, boss! Korea! That's not a foreign country! Back in The Great Koorosh times, Korea was ours! -Not the north one -[Angrily]: OK Whatever! If you do what I say right, I'll help you go to Korea in two months, sounds good? -Not the north one, though -Alright! -Now listen carefully what I ask -[Filled with joy]:I'll do whatever you ask It's a small thing. The judge has a habit to drink tea whenever he finishes with a case When he asked for tea, be a volunteer to get him some Look into Vigen's tea and coffee stuff. There are two cans of tea bags There's one tea bag in one of them. That's for the judge Make the tea and take it to him. Make sure that he drinks that one -Got it? -Yes. Just... what happens next, boss? Nothing. He'll fall asleep for two days and you'll have the time to run away to a safe place Also, no one can know about this. Don't talk about it with anyone It's just between you and me, got it? I hear you, boss. You got it -[Speaking in Korean] -[Laughs] -[Speaking in Korean] -[Angrily]: What are you laughing at?! I was an important person, Judge Nazi There was no instagram back then or else I'd be a celebrity! You can't get it unless you understand this place And what was going on it it Shokoofe No was the best cafe ever. Before that, I was an accountant in a messed up company My mother prayed for it and I got to be the financial manager of Shokoofe No It was so dreamy that I couldn't believe it I became the owner of the cafe But that dream didn't last long. The Islamic Revolution happened and turned the tables At first I wanted to move abroad like many did but no! Vigen and all his shitty work belonged to this country! He couldn't go anywhere else The cafe owner had to give up on the cafe And started producing I became worthless after working for 35 years! The factory went to shit And I owed a lot of money No one would buy that messed up factory Especially in this country with this bad economical situation Judge Nazi, owning a cafe and dancing isn't a crime I committed I mean it is but that's not all The biggest crime I committed was wanting to produce in this country He's telling the truth. Poor guy lost so much money Punish him more, he deserves it Dear lady, you believe lies easily! He didn't spend any money -He didn't? -No, the person you call the boss paid for it, right? -How did you know? -I'm a judge -He didn't even own a factory -He didn't? -Did you own a factory? -[Strammers] No. He didn't even own a cafe He was the financial manager The owner moved abroad and he stayed here Then after a while, he became the cafe owner Am I right? You know what your biggest crime is? That you've been pretending to be Armenian for years! [Shocked]: What?! Judge Nazi! How did you figure that out?! Just tell me why To be honest, I thought if I act like this, people would trust me easily That's why I became Vigen Because I loved Vigen so much [Singing one of Vigen's songs] Rest in peace, Vigen Excellent! You're the first one who got what a jerk I am! -[Angrily]: Jackass! -HEY! [Door closes] -We're going to the cafe? -Yea You think it's done? It'll be by the time we get there. I just hope this girl doesn't mess it up I dreamed of going to Korea since I can remember Not the north one, Judge but the South Korea Every night I dream of going to Korea and performing with BTS! [Crowd cheering] One of our relatives participated in a protest against the government a few years ago A few pictures of him was posted and then he moved abroad easily I decided to participate in the protests as well So that I can go abroad too You won't believe the things I've done I participated in all kind of protests that were there But I wasn't lucky. I've been doing this for 3 years I'm everywhere but nowhere as it seems I guess I know the rest of the story well You went to the protest of the people who lost money in Atiyeh And claimed that they owe you 600 million Tomans I said that's how much I need at least. I have to spend in dollars in foreign coutries Is 600 million Tomans really that much? -If the dollar was cheaper, we could work on that -All right Look judge, I know the crime I committed isn't that big But since I'm young and I wanna get married, give me a more punishment please Yes please, judge -We invite you all to the wedding! -But you two don't have a criminal record. I'd give up on my share for these two poor ones -You're the best, Heshmat! -Yes, you are! You've been so kind to us I'd give up on half of my share as a wedding gift to these love birds! -Since they wanna start a new life -[Speaking in Korean] Thank you Well, you made my job easier According to what you all said, I gotta tell you that in this case, the prime accused person, Is sentenced to the most severe punishment as in death since they caused disruption in the economic system Good for them! They can easily move abroad! Excuse me. Who is the prime accused person? The one who took 36 billion and caused you trouble Now the next accused person or as you call him, the boss He's sentenced to 20 years in jail He's so lucky! Right, Heshmat? Now it's your turn I punish you all the same You're all sentenced to 5 years in jail -So our share of money is equal -Deal -120 million each -[Judge]: Alright I announce the end of the trial Now someone please get me some tea. My throat is dry -I will bring you the tea -Thanks very much I'll go help my wifey if you let me Love drives us insane, right? Yes [Chuckles] Only an insane person can stand in front of a ready-to-shoot gun! Thank you very much [Pouring] [Singing] -Why did you put it aside from the others? -That one's special for the judge -For who? -The judge -No! -Be careful not to burn yourself! The special things of you are only mine now! I'm sensitive on you! Go away! Damn your sensitivity! I calculated it all. Heshmat, is that OK? Thanks. I can pay the Dolton Aunties now Now the love birds 185 for the groom and 120 for the bride -Dance for us! -Give my share to wifey. We're together -Here you are -The judge first Thank you very much -When will you bring me tea? -Soon! I hope so -Now the factory owner who lost money! -Don't remind me! It sets me on fire! It's mine and these two are for you Here you are -I don't drink -Why not? No reason -You better not, too -I will And since you're mine, what's yours is mine! You got your money And these documents are mine. I'll kick all their asses with these! Oh we forgot something -What? -Come here It's private family talk, dear judge! -Alright -OK You're so happy. You forgot 5 millions for the judge He's right. he earned it. I'm OK with it What? Why are you agreeing? I got 100 and you got 200 and we both have to pay 5? How's it fair? -The boss' orders -[Shouts]: I don't care! Don't argue! The judge is sleeping! It's not time to sleep Judge! Hey! Are you sleeping? -What the hell are you doing?! -Help him breathe He doesn't need that What happened? -He looks like he had a heart attack -What are you saying?! Judge! -Who did this? -Look at him! He's sleeping like a baby! Put that aside! The boss asked me to kill him! With this. And I refused He said he'll leave it to someone else. Which one of you did it?! -I think the boss is calling -Give that to me Hello? Look... I'll find you wherever you are! I'm Kamal Yes, he's dead I won't let you disrespect his soul Yes. What?! Police? Where? What?! Oh God -What happened? -He hung up The boss said the police is coming here. Take your money and run! -So we should just leave him here? -What do you expect then?! If we get caught with a corpse, murder will be added to the crimes we committed The boss asked to take his car and leave it somewhere -Take the documents! -No, let the police have it. Let's support the judge! I'm leaving! You came in our lives when it was late and you left us soon I'll change the name of The Dolton Aunties I'll call it The Nazi Gang! in your loving memory, The Great Judge Nazi See you on the other side It's done Everything went as planned How are you the great master?! -Are they gone? -Yes, for good! -It's called the perfect plan! -No plan is perfect, kid!
