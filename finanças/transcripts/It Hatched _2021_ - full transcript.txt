No, no, don't... No! No... Don't... No! No... No! Don't... please don't! Pétur... Pétur... You seem a little out of it, man. Have you been getting enough sleep lately? Yeah sure, I'm fine. Well maybe I've lost out on a few Z's. Yeah, well you need to take care of that. Yeah, well I'll get the chance real soon. Ok. I'm sorry to tell you that your sperm count is still low. Tell me something... how's your work life? Fine, just a lot of it. What do you do? Marine engineering. Well Ship ahoy! Where do you work? Currently I'm contracting for the navy but the job comes with a lot of moving. You know, maybe we just found your cure, you just need less work time and no moving. You sound like my wife talking. Well, wives are usually right, aren't they? Actually we're moving again soon. - Really? - Yeah. Where? To Iceland. I'm Icelandic and I haven't been back for years. Iceland, wow... Wow. You know, that is fascinating to me 'cause I've always wanted to go there. Marine work? No, me and the misses we're moving out to the countryside. We're opening a guesthouse way out there. That just sounds great. Well, that's that. You just found the remedy to your problems. Peace, quiet and some fresh air. B.I.N.G.O. Bingo. Wow this is a great picture. Did you draw this yourself? Anyway I think it's great, I love the colors. You know when my grandpa died, I drew him a lot into my pictures. At first I drew him dead. But then after a few pictures he became alive. Once I drew him flying all over the sky. And he then landed on our roof top and he sat on out chimney... ...and he pooped down our chimney. And the poop landed right on my mothers head. He used to poop a lot on my mother's head. We didn't get along that well. (Growl.) Mira. Mira. Hi honey. I'm just gonna watch a little TV, I can't go to sleep, I have too much on my mind. (Growl.) Honey, are you OK? What? There's this old man... (Song: rjú á palli - Vöggusongur Volu.) I know this song, I've heard this. Are they covering Sigurrós? No, It's an old Icelandic song. Oh. And what is it about? It's a lullaby. It's basically about a mother gentley rocking her newborn baby to sleep... Oh. ...but still informing it that there's a face lurking on their bedroom window, peaking in. - No. - Yeah. No, are you serious? Absolutely. Well, that's pretty dark. Most of the Icelandic songs and fables are pretty dark... ...it probably has something to do with the nature. Or the isolation. Wow, Mira look. It's perfect. Are we really gonna live here? What do you mean? It's even better than I hoped. Just wait 'till we get inside. Does anyone live... does anyone live close by? I don't know... maybe, maybe not. Peter, is there a store near by? Mira relax, it will be great. Nice. It's really messy. We'll clean it up in no time Mira. Wasn't there supposed to be any furniture here? Well, there ought to be. What kind of animals did you say live around here? Birds, sheep and horses. Well... at least we don't have to sleep on the floor. I guess we found the furniture. Yeah. - Mira. - Yeah. Now we need to get a cat. I think we need to get a big fat cat. (Laughs) - Fat cat. (Song: Dátar - Alveg fr) Why are we here? Do you wanna go to bed? No, silly. We did need to get away, right? Right. Do you love me? Yeah. Are you sure? Of course. Do you? What? Love me? I don't know. You are sometimes you know, a bit of a shit. And a bit useless. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I don't know where that came from, I'm sorry. We should've had kids a long time ago. You know, they save love... they save relationships... Get up. I want you. (Radio: Weather report.) I recommend the imported stuff. Yes... I used to drink the other kind but when my wife came back home one day... ...with this gourmet stuff, I never went back. This is what we call in Iceland "stórgott". Understand me? "stórgott". Yes, thank you very much. We're gonna take the imported one, won't we Peter? Yeah. Stop pestering the customers, just let them do their shopping. You stop it. Just let them shop, that's what they came here to do. Stop it. No, you stop. Where are you from? I'm Icelandic, my wife is half-German Icelandic? You could've told me that sooner. So where are you heading to? I was asking your husband where you were heading to? Oh. Well we're actually staying. We're renovating. We just bought a house and we're making a guesthouse. It's a bed and breakfast kind of thing. Okay, now that's something, huh? I'm not sure many travelers, you know, travel all the way up here. Didn't you say this place was like a tourist attraction, Peter? We're aiming for bird watchers. We're thinking bird watchers. Bird watchers. OK, so where exactly is this new guesthouse, this tourist attraction? Well it's 50 kilometers up north. Botn in Botnsdalur. Botn... ugh... Well, uhh... ...Well uhh... I will tell all the bird watchers... When they come here, to stop by at your place. Thank you. (Growl) (Growl) (Footsteps) (Footsteps continue) (Footsteps) Are you OK? Peter, I was just throwing up, you know... I'm not OK. I did notice, you know. I'm sorry... ...I didn't mean to come at you like that, it's just... ...I had a bad dream... ...and I'm nauseous. Well, Mira... ...do you remember that pile of furniture in the basement? Yeah. Underneath it there was a hole... What do you mean "a hole"? In the ground... there was a hole in the ground. I knew it... ...I knew we should've checked this place out before we like, came here and moved all our money into it. And now we're just like, stuck here in this... Mira. I just need to call someone to take care of this. No you won't... ...in case you forgot, there's no phone. I don't know what the hell I'm doing here. Relax Mira... ...I just need to call a plumber to take a look. And now I'm sick... ...It's probably because of the water... and this place... and this water. Do you want me to get you something? What are you gonna get me Peter? Water? You know, just forget it and just like go fix this... Mira! Are you OK? I'm feeling a bit under the weather. How did it go? I couldn't reach anyone. Don't you need to go and see a doctor? No, I'm fine. I'm actually gonna go back to bed. (Growl) I'm coming... It's OK Mira, it's OK, come on, It's OK, it's OK, it's OK. Come on darling. Come on, come on. You can do it, you can do it, come on, you can do it. I think it's coming! What's coming Mira? Mira... I think we have to push. There's no time. What do you mean "there's no time"? Oh shit! What is it, what is it? I think you have to push... Oh my god. What do we do? What do you mean "do"? We need to get someone's opinion. About what? Well... This egg. I don't know... I mean... ...do we even know if it's an egg? It could... it could be an organ. (Eggshell cracking) Peter... ...Peter, come in here. You gotta see this. (Baby cries) Could you close the window? Peter, could you close the window... ...so the baby won't get cold. What are you thinking about? A lot of things. Like what? Like the egg... that kid... ...and you... holding it. And what are your thoughts about that? I don't know. Mira... ...what's going on? What? Are you insane? Calm down, Peter. Sorry. OK... ...Now, this is weird. OK. "OK"? Yeah, but is it bad? Probably. No... Are you sure you're just not scared? Of course I am. And frankly I'm pretty creeped out. You're such a prick... such an immature prick. You know, you're just too scared of facing the responsibility. Are you insane? Mira, you face the responsibility, you just laid an egg. I just need to take a look at those eyes. Just a peak. Yup. If I remember correctly I hid by that nest for a week or so... ...Just to capture that shot... Well worth it though. It's hard to describe the feeling that you get when... ...watching that hatching, makes it's way from the egg. This certainly is a strong and healthy boy you have here. But... ...how big was the boy when he was born? How big? Yeah? He just... ...I mean, he... ...He just... ...He just came from... Well, hello there. Nice to see that you are up Oh, watch out. You must be sore. Please, have a seat. How are you feeling? - I feel alright. - Are you sure? - How is he? - I am Hafli. - Mira. He is great. Healthy as a horse as we say in Iceland. - There you are. - Aren't you healthy? He's a peach, isn't he? He is truly beautiful. Are you sure you're alright? Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, I feel fine. Well I suppose if you're fine it's OK that you just get dressed. If that's OK with you. You just have to promise me to drink as much as you possibly can... ...Gallons of water and sleep a lot. - Thank you doctor. - No problem. And just remember you promise to rest. I will, thank you. Well, I think this is it... ...Unless... ...you have any questions. Is there a plummer around here? A plummer? Yes, we have a broken pipe in our basement... ...a leak that needs attention. Maybe I should pay you three a visit. Take a look at the stitches and so on... ...there is a plummer around. I could probably trick him into coming with me. A plummer? Out here? Yes sir. Well at least the closest thing to one this far above the equator. A jack of all trades. Peter, did you bring any clothes? I'm asking you to help me through this. I can't do this alone. I love you Peter. - I love you too. Love us... ...at least try... for me. (Baby cries) It's probably just a stomach ache. Should I get the doctor? No, I'm sure it'll be fine. (Mira sings: Schlaf kindlein schlaf.) Your father tends the sheep, Your mother shakes the apple tree As falls down a dream for thee Sleep my child, sleep Sleep my child, sleep In the sky there drag the sheep The shepherd, he is like the moon In the sky with lambs bestrewn Sleep my child, sleep Sleep my child, sleep Christ child has a sheep Your beloved mother shears the ram to make fine clothes for madame Sleep, my child, sleep There's my big boy. Could you hand us a towel? Could you hand us a towel? Yeah daddy, could you hand me a fresh towel please? Earth to Peter. I don't know where we keep the towels. Well, come here and look over young Nikulas and I can get the towel. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course I can get it. Look at you. Oh, here's daddy. Look what I... What? What's wrong with you? It was an accident. I'm gonna get him dressed now. Mira, really... ...I'm sorry. - Hi there. - Good day. This looks way better than I recalled. Damn, how spooky this place is. Hi, welcome. I was just saying how lovely this place looks. - Oh, thank you. - Hello. Well... Where's the leak? Boy, oh boy... ...I think you need something more than just a plummer. One could assume you two of you are spiking the breast milk with steroids... ...I've never seen a child grow this fast. What do we have here? I'm really not sure. This hole should not be open. What? What was covering it? Hulda, my dear. Calm down That stone tablet. I don't know how to read runes but that tablet seems awfully old... ancient... What do you think this runes mean? This hole must be closed, urgently! I won't spend another moment in this house! Did you fix it? Leave! I'm sorry about this, I'll see you soon. Bye. Peter... Peter. Could you hold him for a minute? I'm going to the bathroom. There. Mommy'll be right back. Hello... (Baby cries) Hello. (Mira humming: Schlaf kindlein, schlaf) There my little one. Are you OK? Mara... When you say you've missed entire days, what do you mean exactly? I don't know. Sometimes... I feel like I'm awake... ...but yet... still asleep. Has this been going on for long? How was your sleep before? Before, I came here? Before the newborn. I've never been great at sleeping. Or... I've never slept much. I don't know. But it has never been this bad. You've been abroad for so long. You are no longer used to the amount of day light up here. Just try to close the curtains. Just close them properly. Do you know lived in "Botn", before we moved in? Nobody has lived there for many years. But, do you know who was the last resident? His name was Gunnar. His wife left him... ...she left him all by himself and...never returned... Following that incident, he closed himself off. Untill... Untill what? Marriage can be a struggle for some. Others find solitude even more difficult. Perhaps that's what Gunnar was trying to escape. Escape? He shot himself in the head on his kitchen floor, Kaboom! That's how he escaped. Yup, yup. But, hey... ...how is it going with that tablet? Huh? The stone tablet. Have you decrypted the runes yet? No, I have not. It is a unique item. It might be younger than it looks. It's in a flawless condition. It might just be possible that Gunnar, wasn't an amateur archeologist but rather an artist. At least more of an artist than people had thought. The woman, she didn't leave. She never left. Not her, and not her child. My wife? No, she is at home. Not your wife. The woman! She should've left... But she didn't. Mara... Help me father, son and the holy spirit, Amen. Hey. Evening. Good evening... A beautiful evening. Yeah... Mild and calm, dark and heavy... ...it's the best time of the year around these parts. When the dark returns. What do you want? I find the darkness quite interesting... ...it varies in weight. You can't weigh the darkness... ...it's just the lack of light. One's psyche has no boundries. It simply feels what it feels. How's your wife? My wife? She is fine. Why do you ask? Marriage can be difficult. Especially when a new member joins the family. Yeah... Is he strong and healthy? Sure... Yeah. They are so delightful these poor little things... ...So sweet and helpless. Did the birth go well? Are you the father? What? Is the child yours? I'm not sure. I think we both know that the child is not human. Under no circumstances can it leave the premises. What can I do? What do you mean? We must stick together, us pals. The floor is creaking, loud and clear, a creep that breeds a scare, now the curtain falls, dark and cold, as a woman lays with a mare Goochie, goochie goo. Oh my god. Peter did you see that? Oh my god, daddy aren't you proud? What? Nikulas, he was just smiling. Isn't that fantastic? Yeah. "Yeah". Is that all you have? What do you mean? I don't know. You know, I'm witnessing a miracle. Like the greatest miracle there is. And you just say... "yeah". Mira, I don't think you're handling this in any normal way. Oh... the normal way. You maybe can tell me, what is the normal way, Peter? Have you ever thought about the possibility... ...that this kid might be an oddity? What, an oddity? Or a devil? "A devil"? Yeah, or a kind of a... What is it Peter, is it an oddity or a devil? Mira, if you had a patient... - Oh god. - Just follow me for a second. OK? If that patient... ...your patient... ...laid an egg... OK, Peter. I know you're tired... Shut the fuck up. Now, if that patient... ...laid an egg. And then the egg hatches... ...and from inside it, there's this... ...devil. This demonic little thing. And the patient acts as if everything is normal. Now, what would you say to that patient? Peter, you're starting to scare me. You're avoiding the subject. You would say, that patient is nuts. That person is insane. An insane person with a devil egg, right? Right? Are you listening to yourself? Is that how you see Nikulas? Who? Nikulas? You mean this devil, from an egg? I thought that everything was just gonna be different this time. Mira... ...we need to get rid of the kid. You know... us ...coming here... ...was a bad idea. I think... ...you know, I think I need to leave. Damn this house. Peter, I'm leaving and I'm not changing my mind. Mira... don't be a gumdrop. Don't be a silly-Billy-gumdrop Well... OK. Mira, I love you and I love our little son. I just wanna shrink the both of you down and... ...put you in my pocket and walk around. The car... it wouldn't start. Do you know why? I don't know... it is old. Are you sure you didn't do something to the car? What... who me? Are you serious? You're being a silly-Billy-gumdrop again. Well, I'll be leaving now. Mira! Mira! I won't let you leave! Are you OK darling? Shit! Maybe we should go and see the doctor. Mira! Let's stop this silly game and make up, OK? We could cuddle! Make love! We could go for a stroll with young Nikulas. I could even teach him how to ride a bike! Mira. Give me the boy! I'm gonna take that fucking kid of hers and I will... Honey! I'm home! I've already counted to 10 and I know you're here somewhere! Mira, darling! Mira, ready or not! Mira. Honey. Bium, bium bambalo, Bambalo and dilli dillido, I will rock your cradle tonight, And then I'm gonna eat your brains out. (Growl) No, Mira! Mira, please help! Mira, I love you. Remember all the good times... No, no, no! (Growl) No! No, go! No, no! (Growl) (Peter screaming) So, would you like them over easy or the sunny side up? Alrighty mister. You know, that's the way I always wanted them when I was growing up. I used to be so mad at my mother if she put them on the sunny side. I would just not eat them... ...not even if there was nothing else for me to eat. The same was actually with bratwurst... ...remember, the sausage. It had to be black as Cole if I was supposed to eat it. Wow... ...what a great picture. I love the colors. You know what? When you grow up... ...I think you're gonna be somebody like Leonardo Da Vinci or Andy Warhol. Oh, they are painters. Artists. I'm gonna tell you more about that later. Is anything on TV? OK, this looks good. Yes, you like this. I can tell.
