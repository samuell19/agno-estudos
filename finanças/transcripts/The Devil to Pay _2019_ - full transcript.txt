Okay, spit. All right, let's check this pirate ship. Upper deck. Mm-hmm. Lower deck. Mm, okay, good. Off to bed. Okay, come on. Get up in there. Mama. Hm? I want Daddy to tuck me in. I know ya do. But your daddy off gallivantin'. And what I tell you about your daddy when he off gallivantin', hm? He always come back. He always come back, that's right. 'Cause you his butter bean. And you my butter bean. And there ain't nothin' gon' keep you away from us ever. ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪ Find your other shoe, Coy. We got work to do! I'm lookin', Mama! Tarlee! Put some muscle in it. Use little strokes, like that. Put 'em there. Just drop 'em. Go on, get some more. Coy, stop it 'fore I take take that stick to you. That ain't our generator. Come here. You done your mornin' chores? I'm tired, Mama. Oh, you tired, huh? Come on over here. Come on, sit down. Come on. Sit down, I'ma tell you a story. All right. Once upon a time there was a little boy who lived on a tiny farm by a shallow creek, and his family worked very hard to make that tiny farm prosper. But that creek just wouldn't give 'em enough water. So one day, the mama asked the little boy, she say, "Take them pebbles from that creek bed, "pile 'em up along the bank, and soon enough "the creek gon' run deep, give us all the water we need." And the boy set out, but the day was hot and the little boy grew tired. And then he look up and notice a bunch of crows in the trees. And the little boy call out to the crows and say, "Crows, help me take these pebbles from the creek bed "and pile 'em up along the bank." And a crow say, "What's in it for us?" The boy said, "Well, know you all like all the tomatoes, "but Mama always rushin' ya off. "Our creek run deep, our farm get bigger, "then there be enough tomatoes for everybody. "What you think about that, crows?" The crows think, think, think and they think, and the crows say, "We'll help you as long as you help. "We not going to be doin' all the work." And the little boy say, "Sound good to me. "That'd be just fine." So then the crows swoop down, scoop up a pebble, stack 'em lightnin' fast on the bank, so fast the little boy say, "They don't need my help. "They be done in no time." And then he leaned back, closed his eyes, think he's a smart boy. Soon enough, wake up from his nap, and guess what? What? He was covered in pebbles. Covered in pebbles so much that he couldn't move. And the little boy say , "Crows, crows! "What you do, crows?" The crows fly down, the crow say, "Little boy, we said we'd help long as you help. "That was the agreement, but you done fell asleep "and left all the work for us, "and we can not let that stand." So then the crow stood on his chest, lean in and say, "I sure was lookin' forward to them tomatoes. "But them eyeballs of yours look mighty fine. "I think I'll have a taste." And he pluck out the eyeball and swallow it whole. And then he pluck out the other one and he swallow that one, too. And he said, "Mm-mm, mighty fine indeed." And then he fly off. Now what you learn from that story? It's a big ol' ugly world and don't nobody owe you nothin'. Ain't no half-steppin'. You do the work, you reap the reward. You lazy, you lose body parts. You want your eyes plucked out? No! Well go on. All right then, best to get to work. You better eat that bacon, boy. You know how many jars of okra that cost us? I want to see a clean plate when I get back. Mornin', Lemon. Taxes was last week. We're paid up. Now this ain't that. Gon' need to come in. Dixon! I'm comin'. Like I said, we're gon' need to come in. You play? I smell somethin' cookin'. Hey, little man. Whatcha got there? Bacon. Mm. I ain't never seen you before. Ain't a reason you should have. Lemon. Take a seat. Now. You know I wouldn't be here if I didn't have to be. Can't this wait till Tarlee get home? How long he been gone? You got to go see Tommy. Can't I just deal with you? I told you all I know. Ain't no way around this one. It might be a day or two for it to play out, and we're stayin' 'til it's done. Tarlee got the truck. Best get walkin' then. Finish up, Coy, we headin' out. Sorry, Lemon. He got to stay. Don't worry, I'm real good with kids. Way it is. These two men gon' take care of you for a spell. You be good. Maybe draw me some of those pictures. And I'll be back real soon. You in my heart, butter bean. You in my heart, Mama. Tommy, that Cassidy girl's here. Oh good, invite her in. Kitchen. Well hey. Come on in, sugar. Take a load off. You've got to excuse me, but the boys wanted some biscuits. Hell of a ramble through those woods. You must be parched, hm? I suppose you're wonderin' why I summoned ya. I reckon you got a good guess, though, huh? Here ya go. Where's Tarlee? I don't know. Truly. Yeah, I figured. Well, drink up, you need your electrolytes. Mm-mm! The key is to wait till they're almost done and then you brush 'em with a little bit of butter. Mm, they brown up real nice. Anyone tells you to brush 'em with an egg is an ignoramus. Tarlee is skunked, Lemon. Pay taxes every month. Wade tell you otherwise? No, no, he did not. But this ain't about my generator. I provide you a means to power and you pay on time and I thank you for that. I like helpin' you. You keep up your end. Gives me peace of mind. That way all I have to worry about is bakin'. Keeps the cookie jar full. Now, this is somethin' else, Lemon. Tarlee is a dreamer. Dreams of more for you and your boy than he can scratch out of that earth, and I don't blame him. I don't blame him, not one bit. But dreams can be dangerous, can blind a man to his duties, make him take risks. Sometimes those risks don't pay out. You might end up owin' a debt to somebody. In this case, it's me. Now, I gave him a chance to make it right. I told him to go fetch me somethin', bring it back. Done, clean slate. But I hadn't seen him since I tasked him, and you know what the consequences are if he lets out. This is as hard on me as it is you, but we both know the Creed. Find Tarlee, return what's mine or I'll murder your boy and I'll bury you alive right next to him. Biscuits are ready. I'll give ya a couple for the walk. Are you okay? No, I am not. I'm pourin' peach today. Don't need a drink. Knox? Hagen. Need a car. Don't got nothin' to barter. Got a delivery need to be made today. You do that and you can use the car. It's the Heathens, now. I been puttin' it off so they're hot to get it. Sound fair? Don't you even touch this box less you put these gloves on, ya hear? What is it? Vitriol. Burn through your flesh, clear to the bone.

Tarlee? No. Tarlee! Okay, oh! Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. What did you take? Good to see ya again. Shut it. That say Knox on it. Take a bushel of Empires, peak ripeness, you pick the best three or four, that's about the sweetest thing as you can ever put between two layers of crust. Anybody that tells you to add sugar to an apple pie is an ignoramus. You asked Tarlee to slash. He ain't no criminal mastermind. This what you have him do? I am failn' to see a vexin' element here, Lemon. It looks like he succeeded. He got caught, Tommy. Percy Knox done chopped his hands off, leave him to walk to the hospital. The man can't till an acre of dirt. You think he gon' walk 38 miles before he bleed out? My husband is dead. The father of my child lyin' in a ditch somewhere halfway down the mountain. I am sorry to hear that. But Tarlee was skunked. I ain't arguin' that. It's the nature of the Amends. We got laws, folks follow the Creed, folks survive. But you an Arch stealin' from another Arch. Tarlee stole from Percy, not me. On your word. I'm callin' a Query. Council gon' hear about this. The Cassidys even been here three generations? Four. Four? Well then. Query away. It's certainly your right, due process and all. This is done. Sendin' your boys home. Here on out, come tax time, Wade meet me at the edge of my property. No Runion gon' set foot on my porch again, you hear? That sounds fair. Hold up, sugar. I am so sorry, but this is the wrong watch. Percy's granddaddy left him a watch on his deathbed and it had a nice little message inscribed on the inside. This ain't it. What are you sayin'? Tarlee took the wrong watch. He's still skunked. And due to his untimely death, it is up to you to set it right. He done what ya asked. Well, he tried. The debt is paid. I see we have a difference of opinion. Guess I'm not gon' change your mind. All right, go on. My brother'll give ya a ride home. I got my truck, don't need a ride. Oh, it's no trouble. One of the boys'll drive yours. Give you and Bull a chance to chat. Looks like someone's been busy while you were gone. Takes a while to dig a grave. Proper I mean, six feet down. Takes a while. See the moon right now? They say you dig a hole, fill it back in during the full moon, you'll have extra dirt left over. Gravitational pull and such. Science. Of course, now you got a body in that hole, you going to have extra dirt left over full moon or not. I believe that's called displacement. Damn it. I was outside last night. Wish I had paid closer attention. I'd say it was a half moon maybe? You strong willed, Lemon, like most folks on this mountain. Hell, it's our definin' feature. And you going to have to do what your conscience dictates. But I'm going to give you somethin' to think about. That hole's gettin' filled in tomorrow. No matter what's goin' on with the moon, you the one that's going to have the most influence over how much dirt's left over. Nice talkin' to ya. Coy, get on over here. Come on now. Hey. Hey, I was playin' in the dirt, Mama. Uh-huh, I see. Now you going to go play in the tub. Go on in, now. Go. Did ya talk to Tommy? Yeah. And? She make good biscuits. And clean off your shoes. Going to dirty up my porch. Things gon' drag on here another day, and I know 'cause of that you got to stay here, but you ain't stayin' inside my house. I'm still a married woman and my husband ain't here. And you can tell Tommy you want, I don't care. You on the porch tonight and that's that. All right. Mm, yep. And I get you supper in a bit.

What ya done to Tarlee was righteous. Folks follow the Creed, folks survive. And yeah, we in agreement on that. Before you did what ya did, you ask why? No. Everybody know he a deal rat. What you got 'round here worth more than a pocket watch? Plenty. And that's all he take? He was skunked. Somebody tasked him to it. Who? Tommy Runion. No, Runion, Knox been in truce for 17 years. That's why it couldn't be a Runion that stole it. Cassidy steal from Knox, it get handled proper. Runion steal from Knox? It's war. Somethin' happen, Percy? Recent like? Ruffle some feathers? Uh. That old oak. What oak? 23 acres north, little outcrop field, was Runion property once, Knox now. Has been since the truce. Last month the big old oak tree got struck by lightnin' and I went up and took it down. Tommy was up in arms. Said her granddaddy planted that tree. I told her my property, my tree. I paid her no mind. Next day, not a peep. I figured she got over it. She ain't over it. She gettin' even. Your granddaddy' watch for her granddaddy' tree. You got proof? Enough to call a Query. Then why are you here? They got my boy. Couple Runions at my place now. Say if I don't do what they ask, he dead. He all I got. I need your help, Percy. Set me straight with Tommy. I get Coy out where I know he safe, then we call the Query. Make Tommy pay for what she done. Council won't stand for it they know the truth. So, what'd she send you for? The other watch. What other watch? She said Tarlee took the wrong one. She want the one with the inscription on the inside. Ain't but one watch, Lemon. No inscription on the inside, just say Knox on the back. What are you really doin' here? Percy we got... Sounds like you was really wheelin' and dealin' in here. You think a watch gon' make it even? My granddaddy planted that tree. Blood needs to be shed. You got that. Why can't it stop now? Arch killin' another Arch, no matter the reason, that means war. Oh, Tarlee stole from Knox, got caught, got killed, you came here for revenge. That'll pass.

Well, not in here. Got to look like you was runnin'. Bull, please. I got a little boy. Yeah, I know. That's tough. Long as things go smooth with you here, Wade'll drop him off at your next of kin. Now, he'll grow up ashamed of ya, but he'll grow up. Let's go. Take it slow. You just gon' leave him here like that? Yeah. Oh my God, he's still alive. What? He's still alive. Hey!
