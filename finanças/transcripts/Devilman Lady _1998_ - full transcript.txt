Cat Miss Jun Fudou, correct? You mostly model for magazines? Yes... Then, do you know this product? Yes, I've bought it several times. I see. Then, please pose a little for the camera. Maybe three different poses for headshots? Good work. Thank you. Hitomi Konno of Delta. Miss Fudou, you might want to watch out for her a little. You're similar in type, so the jobs you try out for overlap. And so far, every job she's competed for has gone to you. I see. Thank you all for coming today. We will contact you at a later date regarding the results. So, that'll be it for today. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The job will be going to your Miss Fudou. Another girl was really close in the running, but in the end, we all agreed on Miss Fudou. Jun! I'm sorry, I've only been talking about me. How did it go for you, Jun? It looks like they'll take me. I wouldn't expect anything less! Let's see... Then, this'll be your fourth straight win? Or was it five straight wins? Miss Jun Fudou, please accept this. What? Well... Excuse me... That girl, I think her name is Hitomi Konno. Say, maybe we should call the bomb squad or something after all. What your agent told you is true! This is a bad idea! Too bad. This isn't really the kind of thing Jun goes for. Hello? This is Fudou. Oh, yes. No, not at all. I just wasn't sure if I should accept such a wonderful gift. It's okay. I'd always wanted to get to know you. So... I know it might be forward of me, but if it's all right with you, I'd like to talk to you about various things regarding modeling. Okay. Saturday at 2pm, right? On Omote Sandou? Okay. A long time ago, there was someone I couldn't do this for. I knew how she felt, but I couldn't return her feelings. I'm so sorry! I'm sorry I'm late. It's okay, don't worry about it. Is this place all right with you? Yes! I feel sort of nervous having tea with you, just the two of us. It's like a dream. I've always been a real fan of yours. I buy every edition of Kiki. Oh, we should probably order first, shouldn't we? Excuse me, we'd like to place our orders. Won't you come to my place tomorrow? You have time in the evenings, don't you? Here. It's a promise. Jun! You are so thoroughly sinful. Very cute girl, though she's nothing like Kazumi. What? Don't look like a child who was caught in mischief. Knowing you, you've already looked into her, haven't you? Just her outwardly profile. But we still have no conclusive evidence. She isn't. How can you assert that? True, she might not be aware of it right now, but Beasts are sensitive to the scent of other Beasts. There are a lot of cases of people with the latent gene, who instinctively sought their own kind and had contact with them. It's not as though you haven't experienced this yourself. So, be careful. I know. Then that's fine. Asuka? You have no conclusive evidence that she has the gene, right? Not so far. I don't think it's like you to be acting this way. Maybe I just have a lot of free time. What else? Oh, that's right. Watching her like this, I can hardly believe that girl is a Beast. I remember you said that when you first saw Jun too. The more beautiful a woman looks, the less you can see of her true nature. Maybe even to herself. I'm home. Welcome home. Are you going out? Yes, just for a while. Hey, that... You bought that sweater, didn't you? Yes... I don't think it's to your taste. Did she give that to you too? I heard from Rie today. That Hitomi Konno girl was saying some strange things when they were in a model photo shoot together last month. Sort of implying that it was your fault she couldn't get any jobs. It wasn't just Rie. I hear she was saying things like that to everyone around that time. I see. I won't be needing dinner. But you're still going to go anyway. Coming! You must really like cats, Hitomi. I secretly kept one a while back. But they found her. I'm sorry, I'm warming the cups right now. Please wait a while. Is rose tea okay with you? Yes... It's good for when you can't fall asleep, you know? That's true. I thought it'd be better if it was properly hot. But I'm too sensitive to hot food, so I can't drink it right away. I always thought that you lived with your family. I imagined that you were the daughter of a rich family in town. When I was hesitating whether to come to Tokyo or not, it was you who gave me the courage. To be honest, ever since I came here, I asked my agency to let me try out for the same auditions as you. But it was no good. I didn't get any of those jobs. No... I hated you and I hated you. I hated you through and through, but there wasn't anything I could do. Because I loved you. So, you see, Jun, there was only one course of action... left to me. DBP has been detected. No mistake about it. I'll call the disposal team. You stay at your station until something new happens. This isn't like me... So very beautiful. Let's mix your blood and my blood. Because I love you. No! She's come out. Don't let her get away, Jun. Was she in love with Miss Fudou? If your definition of love is a beast eating its prey. Withdraw! I'm sorry. Raise your face after you have wiped away the tears Accept the light of the rising sun The sun that set in sadness will come with the dawn It will surely be reborn into a new courage So we can! Feel the head wind and walk straight ahead I know you can do it The power to change the fate of yesterday Belongs to everyone Yes, please believe it Next Episode Next Episode On that day Tokyo is enveloped in a thick fog, and something is lurking within that cool, moist air. It is something I have encountered once before. The Grim Reaper that I met in the thick fog when I was young. The monster that approaches me swinging his enormous scythe. Is what's hiding in the fog that Grim Reaper? Next time: Fog. Please look forward to it. Fog
