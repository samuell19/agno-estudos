But the younger writer had betrayed him so deeply that he could not bear to think about it. The younger writer's work would be remembered and revered, while his own best work, "The Book of the Grotesque," remained unpublished. The writer never found the courage to seek a publisher, but I saw the book once and it made an indelible impression on my mind. ♪ In the beginning when the word was young ♪ And though now he blended one place with another in his memory, the places where his life changed course still haunt his mind. ♪ But no one, no one, no one really knew ♪ ♪ If his name was true ♪ ♪ Perfectly still ♪ ♪ I lay, I lay ♪ (motorcycle engine purring) - Everything springs outta nothing and flies forward to infinity.

When you look at the chain of things, you start talking providence, you start talking deity. - [Narrator] He had known people, many people, known them in a peculiarly intimate way, that was different from the way in which you and I know people. When he wrote about them now, he did not know if he was drawing from memories or dreams. People were truly a blend in his mind, some blossoming, silent, stark, and beautiful. ♪ Perfectly still ♪ ♪ I lay perfectly still ♪ Others adrift, passing into oblivion, utterly lost to him. ♪ Perfectly still ♪ (people chattering) They were all grotesque, all of the men and women the writer had ever known had become grotesque. Although Elizabeth Walker was still young, some obscure disease had taken the fire from her. When she was able to be about, she did the work of a chambermaid, among beds soiled by the slumbers of fat traveling men. Her husband, Tom Walker, tried to put the wife out of his mind. The place in which he had begun his working life so hopefully, was now a mere ghost of what a boarding house should be. Tom Walker always thought of himself as a successful man, although nothing he had done had ever turned out successfully. As he went spruce and businesslike through the streets of Chicago Heights, he sometimes stopped and turned quickly about as though fearing that the spirit of the house, and of the woman, would follow him even here. - Even though I die, I will in some way keep Daveed away from you. I ask God for the privilege. No, I demand it. God, you can beat me with your fist. I'll take any blow you deliver, just as long as you allow him to express something.

There was the mother, the father, the son, the teacher. One of them was a man of God. Pastor Curtis Hartman was a man filled with the spirit, but embattled by forces he could not comprehend or control. - Give me the strength and courage to do Your work, Lord. Amen. In the beginning, when the world was young, there were a great many thoughts, but no such thing as a truth. Does the flame of your spirit really burn in me, O Lord? Give to me the strong sweet current of Thy power. Make Thyself the thunder in my voice, in my soul. Make the people tremble before the spirit of Thee. My God, make manifest in me... (bedsheets rustling) (glass bangs on table) Thank you, dear. - My daddy will be here in a few days, so I'd like us to make sure to keep the house clean. - Yeah. Yes, dear, that's very nice. (pen scratching on paper) Man made the truths himself. Each truth was a composite of a great many vague thoughts. All about in the world were the truths, and they were all beautiful. (book slams shut) Jesus! (papers crumpling) (footsteps on floor) - Mom feeling any better? - [Elizabeth] You are here way too much. You need to go downtown every now and then. - [Nathan] We went to Taste of Chicago. - [Elizabeth] You need to go downtown and look for a job. Nathan! I know you hear me, son. - Good night. (door clicks shut) (clock ticking) (Elizabeth cries) - There is the truth of virginity, and the truth of passion, of thrift and profligacy, of carelessness and abandon. Hundreds and hundreds are the truths, and they are all beautiful. (choir vocalizing) And then the people come, and each one of them, as they appear, snatches up one of the truths. And some, who are quite strong, snatch up a dozen of them. When a man takes a truth and calls it his truth, and tries to live his life by it, he becomes a grotesque, and the truth he embraces becomes a falsehood. And it's the truths that make the people grotesques. - [Narrator] The pastor wondered, even as he was carried by the spirit of the Lord, if the neighbor woman could hear him, if his voice was carrying a message into her soul. Someday, he felt, he would reach her. Yet he knew she was very far gone in her sin. (Elizabeth breathing laboriously) (clock ticking) (dog barks) - There's nothing for you here. You need to go downtown. (pen scratching on paper) - We must take hold of the devil's desire. We must break our lust like we break in a new horse. - [Narrator] In the soul of the minister a struggle awoke. For wanting to reach the ears of Kate Swift, and through his sermons to delve into her soul. He began to want, to also to look again at her elegant figure. (Elizabeth breathing laboriously) (pen scratching on paper) - There was a mission. You know, I came here to start something new, and I can't. There's a reason I... Well, something else, you know. There's a woman coming. (birds chirping) Aye, Miss Tracy, she did not come in my time. You might be the woman. Oh, it would be like fate to stand here in your presence, for once on a night like this, when you are just only a child.

The fear sprang from a story told him by Mr. Wash Williams, another boarder in his house. - Heard you were married. S'pose you were and your wife's dead, huh? - All women are dead. My mother, your mother, the mother's we make. - [Narrator] Rumors had it that Wash Williams was such a tortured soul that he had set fire to himself. To Nathan, he seemed at one moment hideous. In the next, handsome. At one moment, blindly hateful. In the next, eloquent, poetic. - On the day I got married, I got a promotion and a raise. We got a house and I was gonna pay it off over several years. I was in love. I saved my virginity until after I got married. - Diggin' in your dirt again, are you? - Seeds. (paper bag rustles) (birds chirping) I loved her. Me? I don't claim not to be a fool. I still love her. - [Margot] Watch your hands, honey, I just took a shower. - I found out she had lovers, three bastard lovers. I didn't say a goddamn thing! I just took her to her mother's house. I had money in the bank and I gave her that. Her mother sent for me, she called me on the phone and told me to come to her house in Rockford. Her mother took me in the living room and just left me. And my body was just trembling. I hated the man that I thought had wronged her. I was tired of living alone and I just wanted her back. I thought if she just reached out and touched me with her hand, I'd faint. I ached to forgive. Then her mother made her. - [Margot's Mother] The Neighbors and everybody in church will be out there! - No. - Her mother made her. - You goin' out there! - No! No! (loud strike) (cord slams to the floor) (door slams) - [Margot's Mother] No! No! - I know all about the woman, though she's never crossed my path. I know all about her struggles and her defeats. Out of her defeats has been born a new quality in woman. I have a name for it, I call her Calla. Made up the name when I was a true dreamer, before my body became vile. It means the quality of being strong, to be loved. Be Calla, little one. Dare to be strong and courageous. That is the road, venture anything. Be brave enough to dare to be loved. Be something more than man or woman, be Calla. Ah, I haven't lost my faith, I brought it to the place where I realize my faith is too unfaithful.

It was still adventurous. Day by day she worked in the classroom, but on weekends she was 30 miles north, on the streets of Chicago, walking alone. Hope and desire fought within her. In the five years since she had come back from her travels to settle in the Heights and become a teacher, she had been compelled to go downtown and walk half through the night. - These little epiphinal moments - [Narrator] In her classroom at State University, she was cold, stern, and far too honest. - Nothing beyond right now, - Yet in an odd way, very close to her students. - Not living, not dying, nothing.

Mr. Wrong? - [Narrator] Kate had known her share of men, but their company generally tended to make her miss her solitude. - Nathan Walker has written something brilliant. - [Narrator] Kate Swift's mind was ablaze with thoughts of Nathan Walker. - If he sets his mind. - [Narrator] In something he had written as a student she thought she had recognized a spark of genius and wanted to blow on the spark. - Nathan, why don't you come up here and share some of your story? It's called "The Torrents of Summer." (Nathan clears throat) - Three days is too goddamn long for a boy not to visit his sick mother. - [Nathan] Dad, what's wrong with that? This is what I like to do. - [Tom] You can't make a living writing, Nathan. - [Nathan] I can be a writer. You gotta work with your hands and your mind. Writing books? You don't make money off that. Nobody I know makes money off of that. (feet shuffling) - [Nathan] That's what I like to do. - Nathan, you gotta wake up. You go on for hours without hearing when you're spoken to.

And to stay with his servant in his hour of need. - Humble servant in his hour of need. - If you wanna be a writer, you've gotta talk to your reader. Keep it simple, draw on nature. Think in circles, not in lines. Plot does not matter, character is everything. Writing is easy, all you do is sit and stare at a blank screen until the drops of blood form on your forehead. A writer must possess the courage to express what others fear to express. (rain patters on the roof) Make love to words. Make love to me. - Oh, Miss Swift.

(footsteps tapping on sidewalk) - [Narrator] Nathan Walker rolled about in the bed on which he had laid in the afternoon hugging the pillow, and thinking thoughts of Kate Swift. The words of the pastor, who he'd thought had gone suddenly insane, rang in his ears. His eyes stared about the room and he tried to understand what had happened. Over and over he turned the matter in his mind. Hours passed and he began to think it must be time for another day to come. - Do you know Kate Swift? She might not be aware of it but she is a messenger of God, bearing a message of truth. - [Narrator] Then he slept. And in all Chicago Heights, he was the last soul on that summer night to go to sleep. (typewriter keys clacking) (somber music) ♪ Nobody, nobody, nobody knows ♪ ♪ Who am I, who am I, who am I ♪ ♪ Nobody, nobody, nobody knows ♪ ♪ The last soul on a summer night ♪ ♪ The last soul on a summer night ♪ He assured himself that of memory and the moment, those two distinct realms in time.

(wind blowing through leaves) (rain patters on the roof) (birds chirping) The story of Dr. Reefy and his association with Mrs. Elizabeth Walker is a very curious story. It is delicious. Like the twisted little apples, they grow in the backyards of Chicago Heights. The apples have been taken from the trees by children. On the trees are only a few gnarled apples that they have rejected. One nibbles at them and they are delicious. Into a little round place at the side of the apple has been gathered all of its sweetness. Only a few know the sweetness of the twisted apples. After his wife's death, Dr. Eli Reefy worked all day, every day. Alone in his home office on Black Hawk Drive, near Lincoln Highway, the therapist worked ceaselessly building up something that he himself destroyed. Little pyramids of truth he erected and after erecting knocked them down again. That he might have the truth to erect other pyramids. Dr. Reefy had a habit of writing little truths about people on scraps of paper. He stuffed the truths in the pockets of his one tweed jacket. When the pockets were filled he dumped them out upon the floor. Mrs. Elizabeth Walker and Dr. Reefy began what we shall characterize as an odd courtship on a summer afternoon. When he met her she was already fatally ill, but she came to life in his presence. - I had come to a point in time in my life when prayer became necessary, so I invented gods and I prayed to them. I didn't say my prayer in words nor did I kneel down. I sat perfectly still in my chair. It was an experience that I really can't explain. Though I suppose it happens to men and women in all sorts of places. (fan whooshing) (knock on door) - [Narrator] Always, there was something Elizabeth saw blindly, passionately, the hidden wonder in life. And all the babble of words that fell from the lips of the men who opened her presents in that perpetual Christmas under the church. She was trying to find what would be for her the true word. - [Man] God. You are beautiful. Oh, my God. You are beautiful. (Elizabeth moans) Oh, my God. You are beautiful. Oh, my God. You are beautiful. God. You are beautiful. - [Elizabeth] I don't think anybody else ever truly loved me. - [Man] Oh, my God. You are beautiful. - [Elizabeth] You saw exactly who I hoped and wanted to be. - You must not try to make love definite, it's a divine accident of life. If you try to be sure about it, you're gonna be disappointed. (door slams) - I went to bed last night and I started thinking. I thought about you going up with all these people, these drifters passing through the house. - I'm just fine, father. - I'm worried about you, Elizabeth. Marriage isn't what it's cracked up to be. Don't do it. You'll be stuck here in Chicago Heights the rest of your life. - And then I was married and... just didn't work out at all. Maybe I just knew too much about him before then and... maybe I just found out way too much about 'em during that first night. I'm such a damn fool. It wasn't Tom Walker that I wanted, it was marriage. I didn't like 'em. He always smelled like paint. Look, I'm not a ho, but there were so many stories around Chicago Heights about me. It was cloudy one day and a storm was coming. Black clouds made the green of the trees and the grass standout, so that the colors... The colors hurt my eyes. The thoughts had began to come, and I just wanted to get away from 'em. So I began to peddle harder and I wanted to go at a terrible speed. I wanted to get out of town. I wanted to get out of my clothes. I wanted to get out of my marriage. I wanted to get out of my body. I wanted out of everything. I peddled hard. I peddled hard. I peddled so hard that my legs began to hurt, and when I couldn't peddle any more I got off and I fell. I fell on the ground and it... (crying) I just wanted to run away from everything. But I wanted to run towards something too. Don't you see, darling? Don't you see how it was? I cried all the way home. - You are a beautiful, beautiful woman. (newspaper smacks step) So beautiful. (Elizabeth gasps) (door slams) (Elizabeth crying) - [Narrator] The thing that had come to life in her as she talked to Dr. Reefy died suddenly. Along the street she went with the blood still singing in her body, crying so hard that she feared she might fall. - [Elizabeth] Okay. (crying) (train whistle blows) - [Narrator] The sick woman spent the last few months of her life hungering for death. Elizabeth faded one day in August in the year when her son, Nathan, was becoming a man, but was still so young that he had but little sense of what was happening. Only time would give him that. (rain pouring down) Before she died, Elizabeth laid paralyzed for six days, unable to speak or move. And with only her mind and her eyes alive. For three of the six days she struggled, thinking of her boy, trying to say some few words in regards to his future. And in her eyes there was an appeal so touching that all who saw it kept a memory of the dying woman in their mind for years. (claws clicking along the floor) (rain pattering) (floorboards creak) (footsteps tap on floor) The body under the sheets was long and in death looked young and graceful. To the boy, it was unspeakably lovely. He began to think that the body before him was breathing and alive. In the dining room with his dead mother, the young man began to have thoughts. His mind hungered for life the way his mother's mind had hungered for death. He closed his eyes. (rain pouring down) (thunder rumbles in the distance) (Nathan moans) (Nathan cries) (floorboards creak) - That's not my mother in there. That's not my mother in there.

The serious and larger aspects of his life did not come into his mind. He thought of little things. Nathan Walker closed his eyes, and leaned back in his seat. One looking at him would not have thought him particularly sharp. He stayed that way for a long time and when he aroused himself later and again looked out of the train window.
