CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS MAN: The Germans can afford that kind of thing but I simply don't have the resources to fight a libel action at the moment. Anyway, our version is much more like a novel than the German edition, don't you think? Look, I'm not going to get involved in that debate again. That's not our problem. You know as well as I do there's documentation in my book which might upset certain West Germans, even here in England. NARRATOR: In the case of Volkmann versus Langsdorf, Berlin, Kurt Langsdorf and his half-sister Sophie Vogel are accused of libel. The suit is brought against them by the former SS Kommandant Heinrich Volkmann and concerns their publication of a book, written in England, containing a section on ex-Nazis in West Germany. Due to the publicity of the trial, it is likely that the publishers will also face prosecution by the state, under the Law for the Protection of Communal Peace. In his indictment, Volkmann claimed that the book distorted history and that in certain sections the distinction between fiction and nonfiction had collapsed. At 6am, Kurt Langsdorf's brother Gerhard picks up his bags and leaves for Schönefeld Airport. Now that he is 65, he is allowed to travel to the West for 30 days each year. The sun casts a crisp shadow onto the newly paved area in front of the building. He puts on his shoes, picks up the newspaper on which they were standing and proceeds on his way, pausing only to place the newspaper in the dustbin by the front door. He heads for the S-Bahn and thinks of his childhood friend Johannes, whom he will now see after a period of 40 years. It's my birthday soon. That's why they're all coming. I thought it would be a good idea for us all to be together. Gerhard has always expressed an interest in coming to England, and now that he finally can, I'm really delighted. I haven't seen him for so long. Kurt and Sophie have come before. It's easy for them. Anyway, they've got money. JOHANNES: I met Kurt and Gerhard at school. They're brothers. Sophie is much younger of course and has a different father. He was killed in the war. I never met her until 1956, and she was only in her 20s then. She and Kurt have come here for business reasons as well. It's to do with their publishing firm. Kurt has built up quite a reputation, I believe, although I think he's having some legal trouble at the moment with a book written by an English person. Kurt had to take over his father's company. Hydraulic lifting gear. But it was in Upper Silesia, which is Poland now, east of the Oder-Neisse line, so he lost it after the war. About the book... ..I know nothing. I've heard Ludendorff or his wife mentioned. An old German general. I can look him up in my encyclopaedia. It's very old. Printed in 1932 in Berlin. Ludendorff, Erich. Born 1865. German General. Quartermaster. Chief support of Hindenburg in the World War. Partook of the Hitlerputsch in 1923 in Munich. 1924 to 1928, he was a member of the German Reichstag for the National Socialist Party. Now has a Völkische group fighting against Freemasons, Jews and the Catholic Church. Number 7, Zähringerkorso, Neu-Tempelhof, Berlin. I hardly recognise it now. It was there, some days after the Reichstag fire, that I worked through the night with the help of my two friends, Kurt and Gerhard Langsdorf. Together, we tried to remove some of the books and other possessions which we found in the study used by our lodger, Dr Heidegger. All his books had communist tendencies. There were no novels or anything like that. We tried to burn them in the central-heating boiler but there were too many and the boiler was too small. Time was against us. At half past three, my mother said we should go to bed. My uncle took home a large case of what we thought to be the most incriminating material. He planned to take it to the left luggage office at Anhalter Bahnhof first thing the next morning. I had fallen asleep at the desk while examining Dr Heidegger's papers, and woke to the sound of a key turning in the lock. FOOTSTEPS FOOTSTEPS RECEDE FOOTSTEPS APPROACH Mr Schmidt? Yes. - Wilhelm Schmidt? - My father. Number 7, Zähringerkorso. Yes? Do you know Georgi Dimitrov? No. - I... - Perhaps there is a mistake. So, your father... ..is a friend of Mr Göring's? They've met at Carl Lindström's. And this man, is he also a friend? Oh, Dr Heidegger. I recognised him in the paper yesterday... ..as the same man who rents a room in our house. I hardly know him. This man is the Bulgarian Communist Georgi Dimitrov... ..and he's been arrested in connection with the Reichstag fire. With Clausewitz as military philosopher, the fathers of modern warfare were Alfried Krupp, the arms industrialist, and Werner von Siemens, the telegraph builder. ROUSING MUSIC PLAYS MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEECH CHEERFUL MUSIC PLAYS - Will you stay? Permanently? - Where? Here, in the West. I've absolutely no reason to. My life and most of my friends are in the GDR. I'm pleased that Kurt decided to publish the book. He's usually too careful, in my opinion. It's time that someone like Volkmann was exposed. What did he do? He organised the murder of over 300 people in Belgium in '44. It was supposed to be a reprisal for guerrilla attacks on Nazi officers after the Normandy landings. Then he became big in NATO. But he's retired and now manages the family business. But Kurt doesn't usually publish that kind of thing. I thought he made his money from things like limited editions and coffee-table books. I know, but I think he was persuaded by a friend of his who knew the author. Sophie helped to push it. You know what she thinks of the business. Also, the book is apparently written in the form of a novel. It appears that some names were changed and others weren't. Kurt didn't recognise the name of Volkmann. It's not as though he was famous during the war. And then Kurt got a letter from Volkmann's solicitor threatening court action. So that's what the libel case is all about. Later, Kurt recalled that he had heard of Volkmann. On re-reading the book, he remembered that, as a student, he had been invited to a party by one of his more objectionable colleagues. Apparently, it was a very extravagant affair, and some of the big names in the NSDAP were there. Kurt was obviously uncomfortable in this situation. No doubt that's why he was invited. But he remembers Volkmann and Mathilde von Ludendorff, the general's second wife, talking loudly together about some religious sect. ORGAN NOTES CRASH But as he was afraid of death, he allowed himself to be converted by Mathilde von Ludendorff and entered the Neopagan church at the fountainhead of German strength, which she had founded. As far as the libel case goes, I think it will be just a matter of destroying the plates and all remaining copies of the book. Personally, I think the evidence that the author showed me is pretty conclusive. It seems clear that Volkmann must have been responsible for killing the Belgians, but it's not a question of facts. It's a question of legal manoeuvres. Volkmann's solicitor is well practised in these cases. It was presented to me as a novel written in a particular style, which used, apparently, authentic documents to give it credibility. To me, it seemed a good and very original way of writing, especially for a first book. There were one or two sections that worried me, but the author told me they were completely fictitious. The reference to Volkmann didn't particularly stand out. I assumed that that was fiction also. I showed the book to my partner, and he seemed to think it was quite safe. He's had some legal training. On reflection, though, he's not really au fait with the new styles of writing and it isn't the kind of thing that we would normally publish. It seemed interesting. We thought it would rejuvenate the business. It's got very staid recently. Whatever the outcome of this case is, I'm almost certain there's going to be another one. And a far more serious one. I've heard that the public prosecutor thinks that the book could be considered to violate the Law for the Protection of Communal Peace. It's up to the judges to decide whether or not the book is exempt from that law under Article 5. If it's considered art, then we can get away with it. If not... ..who knows? The problem is the use of quasi-documentary style. Although most of the documents are purely fictitious, in these cases, any use of documentation is not usually considered to be art. The author obviously defends the right of a novelist to introduce historical facts or events into his or her work. NARRATOR: And this gentleman in civilian clothes has survived too. This is senior engineer Max Faust from IG Farben Auschwitz. He demanded 1,000 prisoners for the current year, and 3,000 prisoners for the following year. Himmler supplied the prisoners. Himmler took poison. Senior engineer Faust went back to work. His address today is 32 Rubensstraße, Ludwigshafen. When Faust was working in Auschwitz, the following letter was written by his chief, Dr Otto Ambros. "In addition, our new friendship with the SS "is proving very beneficial. At a dinner given us "by the chiefs of the concentration camp, "we laid down all measures concerning the adaptation "of the really first-class organisation "of the concentration camp for the purposes of the Buna Works. "I remain, with best greetings, Otto Ambros." The West German Directory Of Directors tells us what Dr Otto Ambros is doing today. As director of these firms, Otto Ambros represents the interests of IG Farben. He represents the same interests on the board of Hibernia AG, which is owned by the West German state. 14 Kniebisstraße, Mannheim, is Dr Otto Ambros' house. "At a dinner given us "by the chiefs of the concentration camp, "we laid down all measures "for the purposes of the Buna Works." The officer next to Himmler is Karl Wolff. This is the drive leading to Karl Wolff's villa, a meeting place for the top people of the SS. From right to left - Himmler, Heydrich, Wolff. And Wolff still lives here today. Our camera shows him on the jetty of his country house. That is how the chief of Himmler's personal staff lives today in West Germany, in Kempfenhausen, on Lake Starnberg, at the expense of the West German taxpayer. I can't understand it. How many Volkmanns must there be wielding power in Germany today? I always knew that, even if the Nazis were defeated, it would be a long time before Germans could get back to normal thinking. How many times have I longed to go back and live there? I could be enjoying the same financial stability as Kurt, with a big pension to look forward to. Nostalgia and homesickness. In reality, it's like a strange country to me now. I've lost touch with that way of living. It's been over 40 years. What's changed? Christian Democrats leading rich and comfortable lives. Communists and others oppressed, according to Sophie, thrown out of responsible jobs. Not like the '30s, not nearly as bad. When I think back to the Dimitrov affair... ..the fear we all experienced. A source of income - that's how my parents thought Dimitrov. And they were very pleased when Gustl Scherchen introduced him to them. We knew him under two names. Heidegger and Steiner. And maybe we knew he was a communist. Gustl and Hermann Scherchen were both associated to the German socialist movement... ..and Hermann Scherchen was a conductor, and as a musician, he wrote and composed songs for the German labour movement. Gustl, what I've always wanted to know is how Dimitrov came to live at our place, and also, were you responsible for it? Or what did you have to do with it? Did you know him? And so on. Can you tell me anything about it? In a way, I can tell you very little because I never knew Dimitrov at the time, nor had I heard his name. A friend one day came to my house and asked whether I could find a quiet room amongst my friends where a friend of his could study during the day. I don't know why it occurred to me to give him your parents' name. Well, I know. - Anyhow... - I can answer that. He...he went, and apparently your parents were struck by his personal charm, I should say, and his intelligence. And this is all until the Reichstag fire occurred, that I suddenly heard his name and also, where...away...where... ..that Dimitrov had stayed with you. Hmm. Well, I can give you the answer why you did it, because I think the parents were rather worried that Father should lose his job, which after all happened eventually, a bit later, but it did happen, and they were frightened that they would be quite penniless, but with a lodger in the house, it would bring at least something in. Some money. I think that was the main reason. But of course everybody was struck... ..what a nice man he was, and had personal charm, and his intelligence, but he didn't come... He had two aliases. He didn't come with the name of Dimitrov. That only came out on the... In fact, in the paper, when one read about the Reichstag fire, when they said that they tried to accuse him of having started all this, as being a member of the Communist Party. Well, the real names he had were either Dr Heidegger or Dr Steiner, they were aliases which he used, and some of his books, even, which he had in the house - had that name inside. - Hmm. And I can't remember under which name he was actually known to us, whether it was Heidegger or Steiner. I think it was Heidegger, because Steiner, I think, was something I only found out a bit later, and that was that. But it was a bit of a surprise of course to find out that he was an active member of the Communist Party. You suspected always he could be because his books were... ..his library, which he had at our place, were books on the teaching, partially, of Marxism and partially of Leninism and partially of... ..communist books in general, you know? Communist tendency. But that's about all we knew about him, and he was a very pleasant man who came in and worked, was very quiet. That's all we knew. But it's funny. I've always been under the impression that...you knew who he was, and I mean, it's the first time, really, - I've heard that you didn't. - Yes. No, I had no idea, nor did I ever, ever see him. Nor did... ..did your mother mention any name under which he lived there, apart from that she found him so very agreeable. Oh, yes. And the police came to you because they found Dimitrov's diary, and in his diary he had all coded telephone numbers, and when they were able to decode it, they came across your family's name. And this is how the police then interrogated your father and mother. Naturally, neither your father or mother could tell them anything about Dimitrov, apart from the personal experience they had. But... And they could never establish... The police could never establish that they really knew anything about the political nature of his work. But, all the same, the interrogation was so disagreeable that your parents committed suicide, - and luckily survived it. - Yes. Survived it. After the events of the Reichstag fire, and all the terrible repercussions, I decided to move out of Germany. I became a qualified accordion teacher and persuaded Hohner to send me to France to sell accordions and harmonicas and to start music clubs. A few months later, I was forced to leave the country when the authorities discovered I had no work permit, so I went to Holland and continued to teach and to sell accordions. MAN: A bicycle is the best illegal method of transport. A cyclist can suddenly change speed and direction without being too conspicuous, thus causing difficulty to a pursuer who, if he does not wish to reveal himself, has to go on his way. After six months, I was once again reported for working illegally, and as I did not want to return to Berlin, I decided that I should try and settle in Russia. Some friends arranged a meeting for me with an associate of Dimitrov's called Löwenstein, who was due to leave for Moscow in a few days. Goedenmiddag. ACCORDION MUSIC PLAYS Mr Schmidt? Mr Löwenstein. Your sister said you would try and come today. It had to be soon. I'm leaving for Moscow in a few days. I have a lecturing post waiting for me, so I should be well established by the time you arrive. I think if you come in about a month, I shall have things sorted out by then. There's a ship leaving for Russia from Antwerp in about four or five weeks. It's called the Dezner. You'll have to find these things out more exactly for yourself and also get the appropriate visas. When I get to Moscow, I shall send you my address and also speak to Dimitrov. His influence should make it possible for you to stay there, and I'm sure he'll take care of you initially. I'll also make an appointment for you at the Comintern office. They'll extend your visa so that you're not just a tourist. If there's anything else you need to know, my sister will put you in touch with me. But remember, I'm leaving in a few days. OK. Thanks very much. - I'll see you in Moscow. - Goodbye. On November 22nd 1935, I boarded the Dezner at Antwerp and set off for Leningrad, where I then took a train to Moscow. Before leaving, I had changed all my Dutch guilders into Reichsmark because the exchange rate was so favourable. However, on arrival in Russia, I discovered that the Mark was no longer legal tender there, so without money but full of confidence, I set off for the Comintern office to see what Löwenstein and Dimitrov had arranged for me. DOOR OPENS DOOR OPENS I am sorry, but I have to tell you there is nothing I can do for you. Mr Dimitrov left no message to say that you were coming. He is in the Crimea at present, convalescing after an illness, so there is no chance of you seeing him. And I can see... ..no reason for you to stay here from what you have told me. You have never been a member of the Communist Party. And it would seem that... ..your father has... ..an important and comfortable position at Carl Lindström's... ..in a country governed by National Socialists. My father's position has nothing to do with me. If you must know, he lives in constant fear of losing his job. Also... Mr Dimitrov stayed in our house two years ago. You may stay here for a few days. But that's all. Good day, Mr... ..Schmidt. I had ten days to decide what to do. The Löwensteins gave me some dollars to buy a train ticket back to Berlin, but there was still the problem of my Reichsmark. At that time, one was only allowed to take ten Marks out of Germany. I had several hundred to smuggle back in. Some I left with the Löwensteins, and the remainder they helped me to hide in the lids of Vaseline jars. I was accompanied on the train from Moscow to Berlin by a Russian official. He left me at a Polish frontier town. After the two narrow escapes at the German border, I arrived, I suppose one could say safely, back in Berlin. I went to visit a friend of the family who was recovering from the effects of internment under National Socialism. What was it like? NARRATOR: Johannes Schmidt was called up in 1937 to join the Secondary Reserve of the Wehrmacht. He arrived in London from Berlin on a year's leave of absence to study music. His visa was renewed annually until 1946, when he became a British citizen, having been stateless for the war years. He visited Berlin at least five times between 1956 and 1979... ..the most memorable time being 1956. On that occasion, unknown to anyone but himself, he fell in love with Sophie, Kurt and Gerhard's younger sister. He left after two days to join his orchestra for a concert in Leningrad. PIANO MUSIC PLAYS By the time I had arrived in England, most of my family had also left Germany. Then it's all about my mother, who finally settled here in 1939. She had been going backwards and forwards between England and Germany, tying up affairs and trying to bring over what she could. All of our furniture and so forth was paid for to come here, but we got nothing. The Nazis auctioned it all. When the war had started, we received a letter from Holland saying that if we sent £400, the furniture would be sent over, but that would have just been £400 to the Nazis, so we didn't send it and we didn't have it. On her final trip over here, my mother was caught for trying to smuggle out her furs and jewellery. She was in prison for three days. Fortunately, my father knew the Bechstein piano people. They were great Nazis and friends of Hitler's, but Bechstein was also a friend of my father's too. I think my father rang him up from London to ask him to try and get my mother out, which he did. By the way, Bechstein perhaps wasn't quite such a great Nazi. He was what we used to call a Muss-Nazi. He had to join the party in order to keep his business going. NARRATOR: Johannes Schmidt, now known as John Smith, joined the alien Pioneer Corps of the British Army in 1940 in order to, in his own words, have a go at the Nazis. He was given the choice of three British names. Smart, Smith or Smyth. There were two reasons for his disillusionment with Army life. Firstly, the British NCO showed signs of resentment and made him and his colleagues feel like "bloody foreigners". Secondly, he saw no action. His section was due to leave for France immediately, but an outbreak of German measles prevented this occurrence. In retrospect, he considers himself lucky, as many of his colleagues did not return. In 1945, in the last few days of the war, a close friend of his, also a German, was killed in action in Germany by a German mine. Johannes had thought him one of the best clarinet players he had ever heard. In West Germany, and here too, although perhaps it's not so obvious, it's customary to reduce everything to law and order. The State must be protected from opposition at all cost and literally all cost. The amount spent on security is quite staggering. It seems one can no longer express oneself freely and publicly if one is, so to speak, not in tune with the State. How public is public, I've often wondered. Things like that are never really clear. In fact, the law is never really clear. If a case is to be made of this book, and I think one will be, it has to be proved that it's either a historical work... ..a work of art or a...historical narrative. And how on earth do you prove or, more to the point, disprove such things? Kurt sees the case as bad for business. A general nuisance. He feels he's been confronted by a stupid law. As a passive director - I'm only a director on paper - I have decided to become a little more active. The public prosecutor maintains that the book advocates violence... ..but ruthless political games have to be exposed for what they are. Other publishers have been known to win their cases, and Langsdorf has never been considered particularly radical. I don't know if this will help the case or not. But it's all hypothetical, because there is no case as yet. We just fear there may be one. This is the first time I've ever thought about the intricacies of the law, the first time I've ever been put into the position of having to think about it. Of course, I broke the law by leaving the GDR, but that was different. I've thought a lot about that too. I've never been really able to make up my mind, but in the end, I just acted on impulse. And can't do that now. The whole thing has to be carefully considered. Things are less straightforward and more insidious than they appear. THEY CHAT IN GERMAN SOPHIE: This law, I discovered, is very similar to the one passed in 1933, the Reichspräsident's decree for the protection of the German people, and like so many other aspects of our society, it escaped the vacuum of 1945, when we thought a new Germany would emerge. SOPHIE: We are all democrats now, for to be a democrat is up to date. We're almost more democratic than in the States. Sit. Sit down. PLANE PASSES OVERHEAD 40 Marks - £1. 10 Marks - $1. 20 cigarettes - 135 Marks. British officer's cigarette ration - 200 a week. German civilian's cigarette ration - seven a week. 3lb of bread - 100 Marks. Fixed price - 40 Pfennigs. 1 lb of coffee - 40 Marks. 1 lb of butter - 600 Marks. A wristwatch - 3,000 Marks. A toothbrush - five Marks. An apple - a cake of soap. A cake of soap - 50 Marks. A pillow - one bucket of coal. One old uniform and 50 cigarettes - one civilian suit. Oh... SOPHIE: There have been periods in my life since then, only once or twice, when I have felt that I was immersed in history as it happened. That's what I call it when a situation develops that makes one feel as if something new is about to happen - an unexpected change in the day-to-day pattern of life, and you are in the middle of it. And when I feel sad I think, "Why does it have to be us?" I don't mean me. It could be anybody. Paul Grotenberg - secretly sentenced to five years. No-one knew. Charge - suspected handling of weapons. A pistol found in the rubble of Berlin. Seven youths detained for an indefinite period. Nothing was heard of them until five years later, when they returned, bitter and betrayed. VEHICLE DRIVES AWAY JOHANNES: During the war years, I had lost touch with my friends in Germany, but in the summer of '46 I received a letter from Kurt. I have moved away from home, as I found it impossible to settle down there again, having been away for so long. I've moved to Neukölln, to Ilse's place, and, together, we're just about surviving. Food is so scarce and so expensive. We've sold so many things just so that we could eat. It's terrible for us to see the occupying troops living it up at our expense. Even if we could afford to join them in their extravagancies, entry to nightclubs and cinemas is forbidden to us. Even some of the toilets are segregated. And I've heard stories of Americans deliberately running over German pedestrians. And as if this wasn't enough, thousands of people are dying of malnutrition and other diseases. For me, it's far worse than during the war. Gerhard is a prisoner of war in America. We don't know when we shall see him again. My stepfather was killed in an air raid in '44, but Sophie is looking after my mother as best she can. Her boyfriend Paul got taken away by the Russians. No-one knows where he is. Of course Sophie is very upset. It's funny to think she was only six when you last saw her. So many people have been put in prison or camps by the military occupation, even anti-Nazis. As I'd been in a German military prison when Berlin was taken, I had no trouble with the denazification boards. You see, I'd been involved in writing and distributing anti-fascist literature when I was in the army. I hereby declare that I, John Smith, formerly Johannes Schmidt, of Jewish origin, was taught the bassoon by Heinz-Dieter Wentscher for ten months, from 1936 to '37, possibly at great risk to himself. He told me at the time that he had only joined the National Socialist Party in order to keep his job with the Berlin State Opera. In darkest Germany, people drift about with such a lassitude that you are always in danger of running them down if you happen to be in a car, as, being a Britisher, you almost invariably are. MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEECH NARRATOR: One of the most critical breaches of the Potsdam Agreement was the order issued in June 1948, the Westmark in West Berlin. The new currency, already introduced in West Germany, in breach of agreements, was thus brought into West Berlin. Two currencies in one and the same city, an alien currency in the middle of the Soviet Occupation Zone. This meant the economic division of Berlin. Even the Western powers have to admit that, by this step, they have broken the four-power agreements. On August 30th 1948, all four powers signed the following agreement in Moscow. MAN: The German Mark of the Soviet Zone shall be introduced as the sole currency in Berlin, and the Western D-Mark shall be withdrawn from circulation in Berlin. NARRATOR: But a few days later, this agreement too was broken. The Western Mark remains in circulation in West Berlin. It represents an illegal claim to the Western sectors and at the same time a factor to disturb the development of the surrounding territory, the Soviet Occupation Zone. I was captured by the Americans in 1944 and spent a year as a prisoner of war in America. Just after the war had ended, we were sold by the Americans to the French to help rebuild the devastated European economy. By the time I returned to Germany in 1949, it had been divided into two separate states... ..although neither acknowledged the existence of the other. You know as well as I do that the process of dismantling is still going on full blast. The negotiations on halting them were conducted in the name of the party, and we put it across to the public. You can well imagine what that means to us now. Isn't there, in fact, any possibility of really bringing the process of dismantling to a halt, or can't the party at least officially dissociate itself from it? No, there's no possibility. And what do you have to say to that? They pay no attention to us. We'd better not speak about it. Why can't we talk about the behaviour of Soviet occupation forces freely and openly? So as to explain the situation and to dissociate the party from these incidents, and at the same time try to save its reputation from being damaged by them. If we don't do it, others will, then use them to stir up nationalist trouble generally. You've been to Moscow several times in the last year-and-a-half. Has any attempt been made to at least open this question there? Yes, an attempt has been made. With Stalin. And how did it turn out? Stalin replied with an old Russian proverb. "In every family there's a black sheep." He said nothing more. When one of us tried to put the matter more seriously and hint at the consequences, he was interrupted by Stalin. "I will not allow anyone "to drag the reputation of the Red Army in the mud." That was the end of the conversation. JOHANNES: Our thesis about a separate German road to socialism still remained the official party line. But what was it worth in the face of the adulation of Stalin? The telegrams of greetings and good wishes to the Soviet Union? The petitions, negotiations and thanksgivings to the Soviet administration? Gradually, my doubts increased. In August 1947, I paid a visit to a friend of my childhood, Mischa Wolf, whom I had known at the Comintern school. He was now a commentator on foreign affairs for East Berlin radio, under the name of Michael Storm. He had a still more important function as comptroller responsible for the principal political broadcasts. He had particularly good relations with very senior Soviet circles, and he occupied a luxurious five-roomed apartment in Bayernallee, not far from the radio building in West Berlin. Since I last saw him, he had married Emmi Stenzer, the blue-eyed blonde at the Comintern school who had reported things I said to the school authorities and thus became the cause for my first self-criticism. "It's wonderful to see you again," he said. "You can come with us to our country house right away. "We always spend our weekends there." An hour later, we stopped in front of a fine villa beside a large lake. It was the property of Mischa, who was then 25 years old. It really is time that you change that theory of yours about a separate German road to socialism. The party line will be totally different. Mischa, with all respect to your position and cleverness, I know a bit more about the political line than you do. After all, I've worked in the Central Secretariat and I write the party manuals, which are authoritative for all members and officials of the entire party. There are higher authorities than your Central Secretariat. But a separate German road to socialism is expressly stated in the charter and programme of the SED. Then it must be rewritten! I have been told in extreme confidence that a stop will soon be put to this theory. If I were in your position, I shouldn't talk or write so much about it. That way, the change-about will be much easier when it comes. Some weeks later, I was sitting expectantly in the German State Opera. The second party congress of the SED was opened to the solemn strains of Beethoven. On the third evening of our discussions, Hermann Mattern stood up at the table on the platform and boomed down the hall. "It is now my privilege to convey to the meeting, "in addition to many greetings from all over the world, "the most important greeting of all." He then read out the Soviet message of greeting, which had been signed by Suslov, the secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. All eyes were turned to the box in which Suslov sat as the guest of the congress. He stood up and cried, in German, "Long live the Socialist Unity Party of Germany." When the applause at this had died down, Mattern shouted from the table on the platform, "Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. "Long live its Central Committee. "Long live its leader, Stalin!" In the year-and-a-half since the assembly to unify the Social Democrats with the German Communist Party, the SED had greatly changed. At that first congress, a greeting of this kind would have been impossible. I had now realised how insolubly we were chained to the Soviet Union. I never had a real desire to leave. I had no reason to. My friends and my work were in East Berlin. I was a socialist. I still am, in fact, although I never joined the SED. Of course I'm critical of the GDR... ..but then I'm critical of West Germany. Obviously, my biggest regret is that I'd had to wait so long to travel. I don't think that that should be the case. Prost! I could understand Paul wanting to leave. The Russians released him from Sachsenhausen in '51. He finished his apprenticeship and then left early in '53. He had had enough of the Russians and Ulbricht and his colleagues. I thought that Sophie would go over with him but in fact she was waiting to see what was going to happen. Cigarette? Stalin had just died. Food was short, wages were low. There was a constant pressure to increase production norms. There was a lot of unrest at that time. It all culminated in the June riots of '53. Sophie was disillusioned. The riots had brought about a few changes, but there was a purge within the party and a number of good people were removed from office. So, she went over to the West to join Paul. SOPHIE: I made a number of journeys by S-Bahn to West Berlin, each time taking a small bag of possessions. People rarely took large cases with them when they went over as suspicion would probably have been aroused. Passengers were often searched for suspected smuggling. JOHANNES: In 1956, I visited Berlin for the first time since 1937. I was on my way to Russia for a concert tour, and we stopped for a couple of days in Berlin. There I met Kurt and, for the first time, his half-sister Sophie. They drove me through the city. NARRATOR: Although massive rebuilding programmes were being carried out, Johannes was shocked by the extent of the devastation to that city he had once known and loved... ..the streets and squares that were once so beautiful. Do you prefer it in the West? I had an image of it, and it didn't fit. One always seems to be doomed. One longs for what one does not have. When I was in the GDR, I felt amputated. I longed for the freedom of the West, and when I was in the West, I sometimes longed for the collectivity of the GDR. Tja... And what about you? How do you find it being back in Berlin? It's strange. I look around and feel... ..they had it coming to them. RADIO: I never will forget my expedition to my dear friend. One hour before the train started... NARRATOR: On 13th August 1961, John Smith was having tea with his parents, as he regularly did at weekends if he wasn't working. It is not clear whether it was the radio or the television that first drew his attention to the main point of the news that day. HAMMERING CLANGING At the time, the news of the Berlin Wall had made a deep impression on Johannes, but in the years that followed, he thought less and less about any significant political developments which took place in Germany. JOHANNES: I drove Kurt and Sophie to the publisher's office, where they had arranged to meet the author of the book. Apparently, Volkmann was now attempting to sue the original English publisher. They asked me to go in with them, but I decided to leave as I had a difficult piece to play the following day, and with the others around, I had not been able to practise. I have a difficult piece to play on Monday night. It's Mahler 9. There are a few complicated solos in it which I haven't been able to practise very much. To be in an orchestra, you're just a cog on a wheel. You help to create an ensemble... ..but you're told all the time what to do...or what not to do. But when it comes to playing a solo passage, you've still got to try and put an interpretation in it. Feeling. Warmth of tone. And so on. To sit in an orchestra is quite a difficult thing. You've got to be very patient. You've got to rely on your nerve not to let you down at the crucial moment, because playing the odd solo passage is difficult. It's not like being a soloist all the time. And everybody, I think, gets nervous. It's of course also a thrill to play in an orchestra because in the end, you have the satisfaction of having performed, and, after all, we are entertainers. We like to give pleasure to the audience, and the applause in the end is what counts.
