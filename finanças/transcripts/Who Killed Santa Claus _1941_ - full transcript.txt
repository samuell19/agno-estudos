This film was restored by PATHÉ in 2015 WHO KILLED SANTA CLAUS? "There are in the world "only two ways to rise up. "Either by one's own diligence, "or by the stupidity of others." Period. Quiet! Sir, it's time! Sit down! It's 4, sir! Goodness me! Will you shut up? I'm not deaf. Move and you'll spend Christmas copying the following: "I packed up without permission "and promise never to do it again." Yes, it's time! Your holiday has begun! December 22nd... holiday time! You're done waiting. Since the day school started. Bunch of dunces! And duncettes! Dunces, the lot of you. Anyway... Christmas Eve, I'll be waiting behind the chapel during midnight mass. You'll each get an orange and candy. Quiet! Compliments of the Society of Free Thinkers! Get going. Come now. You may go. Vacation time! It's vacation time Schoolwork is a crime Books on fire Teacher on the pyre Watch out! Bastard almost killed us! Who is he? No idea. Definitely not a local. Your Lordship! Look, Old Lady Michel! Mistou... Mistou... Where are you? Here I am! Meow! Old Lady Michel Lost her cat Shouted out the window Give me kitty back! Leave old Lady Michel alone! Stop meowing or I'll slap you! Stop what? Stop this: meow, meow! You do it really well! I'll get my hands on you rascals! The next time, I'll nab them! Have you seen Mistou, officer? That way, miss... I think. Thank you, officer. Old man Cornusse is here... - Let's go in. - Maybe we bug him. Maybe he's in a good mood. Come on, let's go. Hello, Mr. Cornusse. You again... Checking on your cold. 2 weeks I've told you it's been over for a week! - Maybe you caught another. - Yeah, yeah. How's your kid brother? Christian is very sick. He can't walk anymore. Tell him I'll visit soon. Hey, Mr. Cornusse! Where is Catherine? Catherine? She's finishing a doll. Is it a pretty doll? So pretty! As are all of Catherine's dolls. Mr. Cornusse, where is China? I've told you 100 times. China is here. So it's not big. It's enormous, with millions and millions of Chinese kids as annoying as you all, always asking questions. Where was the bandit? Fi-Zhou? Sometimes one side, sometimes the other. Notorious bandit, Fi-Zhou. He made the world tremble in fear. You were never scared? Me, never. I said: "Waste of time with me." He understood. So he speaks French? No, I said it in Chinese. But you can't speak Chinese. I can't? Figuidu fudu nanagudu filigulagu. That's not Chinese? Was he rich, Fi-Zhou? No, poor. He robbed for his daughter. Every policeman in China was after him. Not that he cared. He took me on horseback up the rivers. See? The Blue River, Love River. The good old days. So sad he got hanged! Hanged four times! And all four times... the rope broke. Fi-Zhou was not like other men. I want a husband like him. Why would he ever want you? Why not? Come now, be nice. One night he asked me under his tent. We were served bird's nest soup. Suddenly, a large bird flew in the tent. A bird that talked. A parakeet! A kind of parakeet. It came to tell Fi-Zhou... that his daughter, Princess Aurora, was ill. Here again, dunces? Hello, sir. Will you get lost? Hello, Cornusse. Get out in 5 seconds or copy the following 10 times... So you paint them now? All of those are glued on. This is my masterpiece, so I painted myself. Herculean task! It's like travelling. I never left the region. It distracts me. Worries, Cornusse? Catherine's health. Catherine's health. She's not ill. Just more and more out of it. She doesn't eat. She doesn't drink. Her dolls, her songs, all those stories you tell her. She dreams, even awake. To think, Villard, one day I'll be gone. She'll be alone. I'll be here. Too many things here induce her desire to daydream. Dressing as Santa again? Christmas Eve without old man Cornusse making rounds among the kids? Out of the question! That's what hurts Catherine. Fewer fairytales and more steak and wine. All Catherine needs is a crying, needy baby. Intend to have a child with her? I want to wed her! If she accepts, I'll plead your case to her. I'll say you're handsome and appealing. When the intention is good, God allows lies. Thanks a lot. Good luck... Catherine... Did I wake you? I was dreaming. I dreamt I was asleep. How strange. I saw your father. He'd be happy if you became my wife. - Your wife? - That's right. You seem surprised but I say I love you over and over. You say it with words. You never play guitar at my window. Guitar? You never pass by on horseback. Horseback? You don't carry a sword? A sword, what for? To fight the kingdom's foes or defend me from wild animals. You told me you loved me... a lot. Yes, Catherine, deeply. I'll make you happy my way: nice dresses, good food, modern apartment, central heating. You wonder about my situation but I'll do what I must to satisfy you. But on walks, if ever another man looks at me, will you kill him? Kill him? Will you be more like Bluebeard? I want two children. A girl first. Called Cinderella. Then a boy called Little Thumbling. Love me enough to promise this? I swear you'll be happy, Catherine. Listen. The bells. One day they'll ring for us. I like the sound of bells. My name is Léon. Tell me: "Léon, you can hope." Let me get used to the name. You'll be rich and happy, one day. Whatever it takes, I promise you. See you soon, my dear. The cow. And the donkey. Already put up the St. Nicolas ring? Just to see its impact. Stunning star of Bethlehem, above this poor nativity scene. We'll remove it. Wiser. It's worth at least 300,000 francs. Much more, Kappel. Why keep such a treasure? Our roof is leaky, our chairs bedraggled. Treasure is touching when belonging to a poor village church. Imprudent to show it. Not everyone is honest. Father! Look. Mistou... Poor girl. Go see what she wants. Seen Mistou? Come now, Mistou can't be here. He just ran away. I thought... No, cats have no place in a church. That witch casts evil spells. How Middle Ages! What now? Cold water on my neck. Bad roof, like I said. - Here, Kappel. - Thank you, Father. Kappel! Father! Someone hit me and ran to the belfry. - The ring? - I put it away. Kappel! Father, Father, come see. He broke the stained glass and jumped out here. Look. These dark spots are blood. Have the police tell the Mayor. I'll bring back the druggist. Mr. Ricomet! The priest was assaulted! Knocked semi-conscious! - Who? - A thief, after the ring! I scared him off! A local? All I know is he hurt his hand. Like you! - A scratch. - May I? - Is he hurt? - Blow to the head. Tell the police! He went to the inn to make a call. So you're valat. Valat? I have spades. There. Let's have a look! - I wondered where you were. - Courtyard. - Hurt yourself? - Killing a chicken. - May I call the Mayor? - Sure. Trouble? Strictly confidential. Must be serious. Professional confidentiality. No laughing mood. We'll know soon enough. Hello! Mayor! It's Virecourt. Yes, an important, confidential matter. Someone assaulted our priest. Our priest! Probably stealing the saint's ring. Saint Nicolas' ring! Sure, I investigated. Found nothing. Better if you come, Mayor. Town Hall, ten minutes. And keep it a secret. Sure thing, Mayor. You can rely on my discretion. Goodbye, Mayor. I call a tierce trump suit and slyly attack from below. The method of Professor Schnook! Drink, M. Virecourt? You'd like to make me talk? I won't say a word. Not one! No use insisting. Goodbye. Not a word, not one. No use insisting. A priest was attacked! Since he has nothing, I cut. What if the ring got stolen? Churches are full of potential loot. You men believe in nothing. If the priest got killed, you'd keep playing. And you, drinking liquor. Hey, let's pull a good prank on the teacher. Mr. Know-it-all. Yes, yes! Here he is. Deal! Evening, Mr. Villard! Good evening, friends. - Hear the news? - What news? Amazing news! - A drink in return? - Sure, if we don't know it already. 1, 2, 3! Someone tried to steal the ring. What ring? You didn't know the priest was hit? I had no idea. I fight priests by philosophical principle, but yours is a good man. Not your news? Not at all! Yours is news to me. So your amazing news is something else? Drink offer still on? Gentlemen... the baron is back. Impossible. After ten years, the baron is back in his chateau. White vermouth, as usual. A 10-year absence. Not even a letter. His late parents never knew what befell him. Partying at 18 in Grenoble! Mr. Roland is handsome. This is good news. I never said the news was good. Cheers. Mistou... - Old Lady Michel, Mistou isn't here. - Sorry, I thought he was. I'd like to find him. It's so cold. - Evening, Mr. Rambert. - Evening, Old Lady Michel. Flip! Flip! Hey there! Quiet! You'll wake him up. So what? Wouldn't he rather we have fun than stay here? So why not stay here? It's more fun out there. You're right. No noise. Get dressed, fast! Can you be careful? It's not my fault! Where are you going? For a walk. You two are so lucky. Why not come along? You know I can't. You never try. Walking isn't hard. You used to run faster than us. Yes, but now I can't. Christian, if Pierre and I help you, maybe you can. You want to try? - We'll help you up. - Get up. There. See, you're not that sick! I'll never be able to. Well, well... What are you three up to? - Asking about what to play. - Later. Go tell the druggist the baron needs him. - Today at the chateau. - Sure, Ma. Drink while it's hot. Your Lordship... Mr. Ricomet is here. Should I let him in? Yes. Right away. After a lengthy absence, glad to see His Lordship well. His return will please one and all. We've missed His Lordship. For us it was an honor and a joy... His Lordship understands... Sit there. His Lordship must want to ask me something. Are you... discreet? I can keep a secret, if ever His Lordship did me the honor, the joy... His Lordship understands. My return, Mr. Ricomet, will pique the village's curiosity. - Rightfully so. - Unrightfully! My story is simple. I travelled the world over... to learn there's no place like home. How true. Keep your approval to yourself. I learned 14 languages. I can discuss love and philosophy in every language. Having achieved this, I realized it's wiser to keep quiet. I asked you here... so you'd tell my fellow citizens. I'm very honored, Your Lordship. In addition, my dear druggist, that I've remained single. When I left, my mother gave me earrings to offer the woman I wed. I went all over, all over, and I'm bringing back the earrings. You know everything. I'll inform those who can understand your painful situation. Excuse me. I'd like to ask a favor of you. This one personal. It would be an honor, a joy. Can you get me Chaulmoogra oil? Chaulmoogra oil? But it's a medicine used in the treatment... of leprosy! Chaulmoogra... But Your Lordship, I have none in stock. I'll send for it from Grenoble. I'll bring it myself. I'll send my maid rather. May His Lordship be sure of my devotion and my... compassion. I have someone waiting. My respects, Your Lordship. - How do you find him? - Goodness! He hasn't said a word. - To me he did. - About? Just take my advice. Keep your children away! But why? I love children. Keep them out. Farewell. Virecourt, I have some awful news. - Awful? - I was at the baron's... Tell me, Mayor... Can we put locks on the windows? - I'll send armed guards. - No, sir. No police here on Christmas Eve. Then choose carefully 4 congregants to watch the ring during mass. I'll see to it. Mayor! Mayor! What is it? A villager has the plague! Explain yourself! The baron! Ricomet says he has the plague. The plague. What am I to do? When there's a rabid dog, you make it known. Some people already have burning, itching. You want a decree to scratch? I don't know. At the inn, it's all they talk about. Put the guy down with your rifle! I cut. Then burn the corpse! Belote. Chateau too! So it won't spread. You are confusing the plague with leprosy. The plague is fearsome, but everyone is a little leper. Everyone. Don't scare Catherine. She's pale. Come help me. Mrs. Coquillot, what color is the baron? Don't mention him. Gray or slightly green? I can't bear him. He scares me. I came to see if you had a job for me. Anywhere. They end up starving to death. No one goes near. I won't stay. Understandable. Dangerous for your kids. His disease? That's not why I'm leaving. Germs don't scare me. What makes him unbearable is different. It's worse. Worse? He never speaks. Ever. He makes signs. Silence gives me goosebumps. It's bad to leave someone who's ill. Would you polish his shoes knowing you might find a toe inside? It's bad to leave someone who's sad. Don't laugh. Catherine is right. Every day, everyone loses a little life. It scares no one. A finger, an earlobe, something cherished, a little life, another finger, another ear, an entire life. And then... that's it. Halt, halt, halt! The mountain people, mountain people... The mountain people are here! Dear Mr. Santa Claus in the sky Dont think I'm lazie cause I'm in bed. It's cause my leg herts. So I get really bored. So I'd be real happy if you brought me... You're being loud. So Santa Claus knows we're still here. What are you doing? So Santa sees shiny shoes. I said not to touch Pa's boots. No more room in our boots. It's for Christian, not me. What are you doing? Making my list for Santa. You want all that? Just one thing. I'm explaining so he understands. Be good. No singing with the baron here! What would he say? Nothing. He'd knit his brow and do this with his diseased hand. Go away. Leave me alone. What is it? I want to work for you. I don't need anyone. You'll be alone soon. I like solitude. Who are you? Catherine Cornusse. - I remember your father, not you. - I was young. I remember you on your white horse. Sultan? Black spot on his forehead. I can still hear his hoofs. At night, I'd dream under the table. Father would say: "Catherine, go to bed." But I was scared in my dark room. But... when I heard Sultan bringing you back, I'd go to bed. No longer afraid. And why did you come here? To become your servant. That's impossible. You don't know them. They'll refuse you bread, milk. Let you die. Catherine Cornusse... You know why Marie's leaving? Why they keep their distance? Yet you came. Can I stay? I'll soon be a hideous sight. Me too, a black spot on my forehead. Go home to your father, you hear? You'll obey me. Catherine Cornusse. Since you don't fear leprosy, may I kiss you? Have I been sleeping here long? Sleeping? It was bad to take advantage and kiss me. Father will be angry to know I came alone. Given that you live alone. Angry with me? A bit. May I? Stale bread. Look at me. I'm never hungry. Eating is good. I'm thirsty too. It's just water. Bread and water, marvelous! What a child. I can't stay any longer. Why not? Nasty people will invent reasons. What reasons? Don't keep me longer. Father will be angry. Don't leave so fast. I'll see you at church tonight. I'm playing organ. Goodbye. See you tonight. Careful, Father will be there. You want a match for your stub? Did I ask you to speak? Mother, can I help you? It's too easy being nice just before Santa comes knocking. Will you tell him I broke the stand? And I peed in the coal? No need. He knows everything. Even what you hid from us. He knows that too? Who is it, Pa? It's him. Whichever of you has a clean conscience may go open. What a sorry sight! I'm coming, Santa Claus. Hello, Santa Claus! - Good ride? - Yes, thanks. But I'm getting old. Very heavy load. Tonight I have for Raoul... a new umbrella stand. And some coal for Albert. Sit down. We'll help you. Join us for a drink. I'd love to. A teeny-tiny drink. And... you have nothing else? I do. Deep down in my basket, two small whips! Two! Last year's seems to have worn out. Now you'll have a spare one till next year. But further down, there is a nice surprise. Cheers, Santa. How is Catherine? More and more out of it. At 18, she doesn't know what a mirror is for. Come in, Roland! - You knew it was me. - Of course. After you left, I thought tonight was my last Christmas Eve. Don't say that. I came to ask you to supper. At your home? Rather unseemly. Then at the inn. I don't have a nice dress. Stay as you are. First Christmas Eve I want to be pretty! - It's not your last. - It is. The first... and the last. You see, Roland, if you're not here next year... Don't move. It's Mr. Léon. You can see through walls. Who is Mr. Léon? He often comes. Lots of dandruff and hair in his ears. He's leaving. He's coming back. He's kicking the door! Now he's leaving. Catherine... the chateau has old wardrobes full of stunning dresses. Choose the one you like. Go on, now. Tell me you'll come. Must I say it so you'll be certain? So long. I'm already waiting. When you're nice with Daddy, you get a train. When you're nice with Mommy, you get a boat. When you're nice with everyone, you get a train, a boat, a clarinet... Santa, another drink? No, my head's already afire. The stove. Some plum brandy. So you don't catch cold. But I must admit that little René... Roger, Santa Claus. ... was very brave during his scarlet fever. His mumps. So many children, so many illnesses. I lose track. Cheers! Before the heat of the stove kills me. Is all well, otherwise? Yes, fine, thanks. - And up there? - Where? Yes... in the sky! Up there? All's well, thanks. A few minor incidents. Rivalry, gossip, like everywhere. So I'd like to reward little Raymond! Roger. I want him to have a houseful of toys. But Santa... we said you weren't rich this year. Understand me. The house won't be full of toys. It will not be full of toys. But a house without toys? It will not be a house without toys. I'll keep on making my rounds. Goodbye, Robert. Roger, Santa! Heat of the stove! Good thing it wasn't on! Thank you... Don't show me out. After 30 years, I know the way. This way, Santa. That's the window. This way. Lean on me. Your basket, Santa. My basket! Goodbye, Santa. Travel safe. Goodbye. Why the smile? Santa kissed me. Smelled like you on Saturday nights. Show your father respect! Look, Catherine. My great-grandmother wore that the day she was presented in court. She must have been gorgeous. This one too. It made Mother's beauty less austere. That's the prettiest. It will suit you well. I want that one! You'll find them all in my mother's boudoir. Everything but the jewelry. Travelling the world ruined me. Why did you go so far away? For so long? To find someone. Someone who was just nearby. Get dressed. I'll pour champagne. You'll have a glass with me? Mr. Cornusse. Your Lordship remembers me. You came every year when I was a child. You gave me this globe. Exactly. I came to see Marie Coquillot's kids. In the guardian's house. Am I bothering you? No, have a drink before you leave. Sit by the fire. Come in. Pretty like spring's first blossom. Your father just came. Leave while I stall him. See you at the inn at 12:30. Have a seat. If I sit in the armchair, I'll fall asleep. Nothing enlivens like champagne. Champagne! Comfy armchair. On one condition: wake me if I fall asleep. Do you mind if, to taste the champagne, I remove the nose? - Be my guest. So did you have a nice trip? That globe gave me the idea. I went everywhere. China too? In search of Fi-Zhou, whose daughter I wanted to marry. You met my old friend Fi-Zhou? I met plenty of Fi-Zhous. They stole my watch, tiepin, toiletry case. And every Fi-Zhou only had sons. Thieves like their fathers. Some more champagne? I'd love some but I need to remove the beard. Feel at home. You caused my ruin. Ten years, all lost. I often cursed you. Because of your stories which perturbed my young mind. A nice story... never lies. I didn't realize the real Fi-Zhou, the one and only, lived in the Savoy region. Don't tell anyone. He had a daughter. Fi-Zhou was you. And Princess Aurora... You're late. We were wondering how we'd sing. We'll sing, then leave. Villard is waiting. - I wish I were back home. - Why? To know what Santa brought me. Hello, sir! Where are the others? On their way. Let's make a ruckus! Behind me! Everyone in single file! Get back in place! Move it, dunce! Always last, stooge! Wait for my sign! The nerve! So tasteful. Every year the same thing. - What's that? - Don't know. Gunfire? - Jesus, take pity! - Don't panic. The ring! Who went near it? No one, I swear. Old man Cornusse. Where is he? He was just there, against the pillar. I saw him too. Maybe he saw the thief. He can tell us. - I'll go to his home. - Me too. Don't worry. Drinks are on me. - Hello, Jean. - All well? That was quite a ruckus! Arthur! Hey! Madam... Is all well? Merry Christmas to all! Still prey to this baleful passion? Hello, Rambert. It's Catherine. How elegant. Delusions of grandeur. Father Christmas, daughter Virgin Mary. I'm sure she got dressed up for me. I doubt it. Come, I'll explain. Have you seen Mistou? His Lordship is very late. Maybe he's not coming. He is! I'm waiting. You're wide awake now. Madder than ever, in awe of the baron's title and airs. That's not true. Are you saying you love him? After all I've done for you! - What have you done? - You'll soon see. Catherine, come dance with me. I'll dance only with him. White vermouth in a tall glass! Your 8th. Old Lady Michel, I didn't see Mistou! The noise scared him off. He was under the bench. So? No sign of Cornusse anywhere. We'll tell the Mayor. - I found no one. - Nor did we. Strange. So? Santa Claus vanished. Charles! Is that him we hear? No, it's the wind. Clock struck 12 a while ago. Santa won't be coming anymore. That's impossible! Tons of houses to visit. It's only normal he's late. I said he's not coming. He forgot me. Maybe he thinks we moved. Probably looking all over! In that case what will he do with our gifts? Give them to others? We should look for him. The two of us. You won't find him. Why not? We go to a house he visited. We'll follow his footprints. Like Buffalo Bill. We'll bring back your Santa! Santa Claus! Someone killed Santa! What? Quiet! What is it? Someone killed Santa. Father! Water, cognac, vinegar! Make her come to. How do you know? We saw him at Prowlers Plain. He's lying in the snow. I need some men. - Me. - Good. Get some lanterns. Keep Catherine here. Console her. I'll be back for her. The children will guide us. Come on, kids. Bullet to the head. He's dead. Carry him home. By the arms. Give me some help. - Where's the light? - On the left. Put him there. On the table? Virecourt, have Chambéry send gendarmes. Mayor! Look, there! Who is he? The baron. Why is he here? - Don't touch! - Untie him. Careful not to touch his hand. Untie him, I said. Can't I get some sleep? How dare you barge into my home? Get out! Cornusse? You're not dead? Me? Dead? My dear Mayor! You had a wee drink too many. So who's in the Santa outfit? There's only one Santa: me! I was having a snooze. Go to hell, all of you! Who is he? No idea. A stranger. Never seen him around. Why is he snoring on my table? He's dead. Dead drunk, you mean! Now get out of here! A drunkard in my home? Where do you think you are? The ring's gone. A man's dead. The baron's here. Bound, gagged. Your Lordship? Why are you here? - It's my investigation. - Do it elsewhere! Quiet! What happened, Your Lordship? It's very simple. I wanted to surprise Catherine Cornusse. Her father paid me a visit and fell asleep. I decided to borrow his outfit to bring a pair of earrings here without being recognized. Liar! Not true! I never fell asleep at the chateau! Who are you to give Catherine jewelry? Exactly. Who allowed you to do that? Quiet, you two. Please. - I was dressed as Santa. - Not true! Only one Santa: me! Quiet! I arrived here. Someone hit me from behind. And I lost consciousness. I know no more. He's telling tall tales! I didn't fall asleep. I remember everything. We drank 2 glasses. It was champagne. I went to church. Mass had started. I went to the nativity scene. I left when I heard stupid Villard's racket. What? I came home... and I fell asleep. Yes. Let death strike me. Death strike me if I'm lying. You brought earrings, you say? Left pocket of the outfit. Go check. If there was jewelry inside, I'd have found it. No earrings. He's lying, I said! He's plotting against me! No one took the outfit! - Know him? - Do I know him? My outfit smelled like mothballs. It's mine. The ring was stolen when Villard's band marched by. You don't suspect me? Old man Cornusse. Santa Claus... almost God Almighty. Why would I have stolen it? For example, to leave Catherine something after you die. An obsession of yours. - What was that? - Enough! You think I'll ever buy poultices again from you? Listen to me. Your response is crucial. At midnight, you were at the nativity scene. I swear. On Catherine's life. Fine. Your Lordship. You'll explain this again to the gendarmes. Until they come, stay confined to the chateau. Don't leave your house. Sir, may I go reassure Catherine? Go on. Take him to Town Hall. Can I get my outfit? Later. For now it's legal evidence. The gendarmes called. Road blocked by an avalanche. Never in a hurry. Mayor... Don't believe Ricomet. Never could old man Cornusse, never could I... No progress since last night. They're sticking to their opposing statements and the body is unidentified. Probably the guy who knocked out the priest. And still no gendarmes! They took a strange route. They left from 11 miles north and are now 10 miles south. At this rate, they'll arrive on January 10th. But you can count on me for a warm welcome. I thought it over all night. I know Cornusse is innocent. You're pleading the cause of your future in-law. No, the cause of truth! I retraced his route. Know how much Chartreuse and cognac he drank between 6 and 12? Forty-two! Not including the champagne. At midnight, Santa was drunk. He remembers everything. To judge people, you must know about the subconscious! A life is made of automatic reflexes! 30 years he's made the same rounds. His statement is just old memories, superimposed, identical. He's confusing years! Obviously. He thinks he was at midnight mass. He went home. He was seen at church. Not him! Not that nameless man in the snow, that stranger, who imitated Cornusse? That's exactly it. A stranger in cahoots with a local to steal the ring. Killed by the local, who kept the loot. And the baron? The baron is covering his trail. His earring thing is nonsense. Excuse me. When I saw him, he mentioned earrings intended for his beloved. Catherine, in fact. Perhaps Mr. Villard is trying to get Cornusse off the hook and remove his rival. Ricomet, esteemed druggist, I've slapped others before. Leave him be? Like him, I serve the cause of truth. Mayor! Are the gendarmes here? They called from Beauvoir. Beauvoir? That's east! 14 miles east. They're further away. Looking for a clear road. By the time they get here... I'm turning in the man I've loved for 20 years. Not for taking advantage of me. Or stealing my savings. To serve the Lord, I turn him in! The guilty party... is him. Bear in mind that my accuser is Old Lady Michel. I denounce him as an abnormal being. He is a monster. He scratched Mistou. He takes walks at night. He wears women's stockings. He puts arsenic in all his medicine. And God only knows what he's capable of. I hope you're enjoying this. The night the priest was knocked out, I saw him in front of the church. Behead the man I love! He deserves it. You have before you a textbook case of hysteria. Look at me. Am I the type to rouse such passion? This woman claims she saw me by the church. In fact... why was she there? We may find the ring in her home. Search my home? Never! I demand a search warrant! Take pity! We'll just accompany you, miss. Virecourt, help her up. I'll need four of you. I don't want this! Virecourt, look all over. Search. Anywhere you want. I don't care. Anywhere but here. If you come near, I'll scratch you! What are you hiding? I bite, I scratch! Step aside. Virecourt, Desfosses, grab her! Thieves, cold-hearted cowards... Whoever opens it will die! The whole place will blow! Rambert, open it. I can't do everything. Then you, Ricomet. I'm not the henchman type. I'm an intellectual. None of you will open it? Me! Die, die, scorpion-child! Mistou. Stuffed Mistou. I'd have guessed. The druggist killed him. Out of jealousy. A cat. Let the madwoman go. It's a waste of time. I know where the ring is. The thief is the baron. The diamond's in his leper glove. We'll search the chateau. Mayor! Corpses are fine, but the living come first. - I'm a druggist. - Go work. We'll go to the chateau. There are people outside. Not Santa Claus? It's men with pants. He won't come. He's dead. Still, lots of toys this morning. Not from him. He's never wrong. This isn't what I asked for. You broke your trumpet! I don't care. And anyway, I found another way to get my gift. Now that Santa died, I want to die too. He'll be surprised to see me. That way, he has to give me my gift. It's true, one dead soul to another. Why not tell me? Charles and I will manage to find it. Impossible. When you say it, it doesn't count. Try to tell me softly. Go on, tell me. Is that all? Really pretty, I must say. To think its painter is accused of murder. And a thief. A murderer. Catherine, look. Look at my hands. An artist's hand, which painted oceans, rivers, mountains. Look. My nose... Do I have a drunkard's nose? Their slander will end up driving me mad. What is it? What's wrong, Catherine? Don't cry. I'm telling the truth. So Roland is lying? That's impossible. After two days, you can't love him so much. I do. More than me? Differently. You're in love? It's as amazing as hearing the world stopped turning. It's not turning. How dare it do that to me? It's against me too. It stopped once in 30 years. The day your mother died. Father, today it's of no importance. No importance? No importance my sign is broken? Am I... Am I going crazy? There. It's there. It'll disappear. It'll disappear or... No, it's... It's still there. I can feel it. It's still here. Still here. Quiet... No one must approach. It's over. The Saint Nicolas ring... The ring I stole... It's there! It's there. Careful. They're listening. Explain yourself! It's in the globe. I saw the ring sparkling. Like I see you. I touched it. - You found it? - Beware! They're plotting against me. But I'm not afraid! Whoever wants to, come on in! Let them try. Get the ring! That's what they expect of me. Waiting in ambush, to arrest me. Red-handed. It's a hallucination. You're against me too. One of them, spying on me! Unbelievable! I'm not a murderer! I'm not a thief! Cornusse is not a murderer! Father! I have nothing left to tell you. I told you what I know of the theft and murder. An unfortunate adventure that doesn't concern me. Your Lordship, we'd like... I mean, we wish... To search? Have fun. In fact we'd like... To search my pockets? Yes, the right one in particular. My right pocket? Well... see what I'm hiding. No, what you were just hiding. - My hand is of interest. - Yes, sir. Perfect. This hand is but a horrible wound. Full of pus. You won't see the ring from afar. Come closer. Go on, Desfosses. - Rambert... - It's always me! None of you is brave-hearted. Me. You must really hate me. Pull, if you dare. - He lied! - The ring? No, but he's not ill. False testimony. He lied to you. Arrest him. I never testified to leprosy. A ruse to keep from being bothered. And here I end up with the town council. I thought it over. The sacristan did it. Mr. Villard thinks too much. You may go. By the way, Mayor... Some news for you. The gendarmes made it? After north, south and east, they're now in the west. Looking for a road. But they're two miles closer. - You may go. - Your Lordship. I have no idea who put it in there. But it's in my shop sign. I saw it myself! Keep calm. I only found the gem because it stopped turning. You'd have kept on calling me a thief. Where's your shop sign? It disappeared. - It's gone. - Are you mad or pretending to be? It's part of the plot. What plot? Rascals! What nerve! Stealing Mr. Cornusse's globe! Bring it back! There you go. Good job. Steal for fun, break by mistake... and you end up on the gallows. Let's go! Learn this lesson! I'll tell the police! You'll see, little devils! It's not there. The Holy Spirit made it vanish with the ring? Tell the gendarmes when they come. Stay here or I'll lock you up. Got it? Yes, sir. Looking for your sign? Yes, where is it? Two delinquents took it. I saw from my shop. I followed them. The globe fell and broke. Where? By a tree in the field. Not here. Not here! Holy Spirit strikes again. Yes, Mayor. Enough of your stories. There was a hole in the globe. Yes, for the light bulb. Maybe it rolled out. You'll find a diamond in the snow? We'll find it after the thaw. At Easter or Trinity. When the gendarmes arrive. You weren't home but I came in. Strange events held me up. How can I help? - My little Christian is dying. - What? He's facing the wall, he won't speak or eat. He wants to die. Save Christian, sir... I'm just the druggist. I should have bought your expensive medicine. To nip it in the bud. I'll pay what you want. It comes from Grenoble. 3 days at least. Take your car. You'll be back tomorrow. Save Christian! You love children. Save my boy. Stand up. I'll go. You're pulling my heartstrings. I'll go now. Mr. Ricomet, you're a saint. Just a local druggist who at times can do his duty. You again! Are you in Nantes? Lille? Bordeaux? What? In five minutes? Are we waiting? We have been for 3 days. Clowns! Mayor! - Mayor! - What? Did they get here? They'll be here shortly! They won't forget the welcome I give them. Listen. They're here. Can you two stop playing for 10 minutes? - Of course. - We'll just put down the cards. Good day. Mayor... - Is all well? - No, sir. We, as town council and townspeople... Thanks, but we're in a rush. It doesn't show. Our indignation... - We're busy. - I'm sure you are. So what's this about? - A man killed. - Fine. - Two knocked out. - Great. - The ring stolen. - Perfect. - You look on the bright side. - Describe the ring. Diamond the size of a walnut. - A hazelnut. - A giant pea. You mean a diamond like this. - It's the ring! - For sure. Happy now? I'm off. One second. You went north, south, east and west, but we'd like an arrest. It's not our fault so many roads intersect here. We had to shut them all. Instead of coming here, we let him come to us. We searched him, questioned him and he confessed. We have him. You got him? In the car, nicely gift-wrapped. - Him. - That's impossible. He confessed. Come see our devoted druggist. It's Ricomet. Hearts! Incredible. Actually quite simple. Ricomet had an accomplice who stole the ring dressed as Santa. He tried to abscond. Ricomet shot him. He then hid the ring in Cornusse's sign. He got it back when the kids broke the globe. He tried to escape. Gentlemen, I have to go. I forgot. Two earrings belonging to the baron. And see to a poor boy who seems very ill. - What boy? - Named Christian, forgotten by Santa. Christian, you're not dreaming. You're not dead. This is the first time in the history of the world that Santa goes out on December 26th, just for one child. And it's for you, Christian. Here is the masterpiece of a good man, an artist in his own way. Here. It's for you. How pretty! Give it to me! Christian, stand up and come for it. - I can't walk. - Yes. You can. You accepted to die for what you love, and thus, child, you deserve to live. And you'll get it. Come now. Stand up. Come. You can walk. That's my boy! It's all yours. - Where is China? - Here. Do Chinese children also have Santa Claus? Santa Claus and old man Cornusse. A recipe for happiness. What do you tell Chinese boys about? France. And French children. And a certain princess, very beautiful, who was sleeping in her chair. She'd been sleeping there for so, so long. In her sleep she had a dream. A magical dream, always the same. She dreamt of Prince Charming who would come one day to wake her. To wake her and make her happy. Subtitles: Andrew Litvack A restoration by Eclair group for the image and L.E.
