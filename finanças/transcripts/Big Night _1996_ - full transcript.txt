Oh, I'm just so hungry. Signore. Oh, that looks good. You got leaves with yours. Here we go. Okay. Monsieur, is this what I ordered? Yes, that is the risotto. Is a special recipe that my brother and I bring from Italy. It's delicious, I promise. It took so long, I thought you went all the way back to Italy to get it. Yes, I know, but it's worth it. I-I-I-I promise. You would like, uh, fresh pepper or cheese? No, I don't need cheese. Cheese, yeah. Oh yeah, he likes cheese. Excuse me, didn't you say that this was gonna be rice with seafood? Uh, yes. It is, uh, Italian arborio rice, the best. And then, uh, with shrimp and scallop and-- I just don't see anything that looks like a shrimp or a scallop. I just, well-- I mean, it's not what I expected. But I get a side order of spaghetti with this, right? - Why? Well, no. - I thought all main courses come with spaghetti. Well, some, yes, but you see, risotto is rice, so it is a starch, - and it doesn't go really with pasta. - But I don't-- Honey, order the side of spaghetti, that's all. I'll eat your meatballs. He'll have the meatballs. Well, uh, the spaghetti comes without meatballs. There are no meatballs with the spaghetti? No, sometimes spaghetti likes to be alone. [ Chuckling ] All right, then, I guess that we'll also have a side order of meatballs. Side order of meatballs. This is fine. Let's just eat. All right, no meatballs. Then we'll just have a side order of spaghetti. Primo, please, just, come on. I want to know for who. Just make the side order of spaghetti, please. Secondo, I want to know for who it is for.

Make the pasta. Make it. Make it. Make the pasta. - Come on, let's go! - How can she want? They both are starch. Maybe I should make mashed potato for another side. Primo, don't, okay, because they are the first customers to come in two hours. The fucking pipes are-- No, she's a criminal. I want to talk to her. You want to talk to her? Okay, that's great. You want to talk to her? Okay, good, fine. I'm sick of this every fucking night. You want to talk to her? Okay, here we go. Go talk to her. No, she's a philistine. I'm not gonna talk to her.

Thank you very much. Cigarette? Oh, yes, thank you. [ Clears Throat ] Thank you. So it is completely different here than when I was before. Well, it's a beautiful renovation. Because we went through that with our restaurant when we first started. - It's a lot of work. It's a lot of money. - Pain in the neck, you know? But I think it come out good, you know, 'cause it's simple. It's a very simple place for the family to come. Very nice, casual. - You like Italian food, right? - Yes, I do, very much. I'm gonna have to change the direction of this conversation right now. Ah, yes, I understand. Okay. [ Sighs ] Is there someone you can borrow from back in, uh, back home? No, because we did that already to come here. You have any saleable assets? Something to sell, like a car, for money, to pay us. Oh, oh, yes, I understand. I wasn't sure you-- No, no, no, no, I speak English. Ah, no, I don't. My car, no. I have a car, but it's no Cadillac, you know. I need my car, uh, for the business, so, no. I see. I don't know, uh. Your payments over the past two years have hardly been consistent. Yes, I know. I'm afraid we can't give you any more time. What do you mean? We can't give you any more time. Okay, Mr. Pierce, let me just explain something to you, okay? I'll explain my situation to you, which is unusual, all right? I don't want to bother you, but, uh-- Listen, my brother is, uh-- [ Chuckling ] It's a difficult situation because what we try to do... Look, look, listen, is very hard, we work very hard. I hate to see businesses fail, okay? We are not lazy. I hate to see businesses fail, okay? Yes, me too. But we're a bank. We can't help people who can't help themselves. If we don't receive your payment by the end of the month, we will foreclose. Thank you very much. Sure. I wish I could pay you with money. [ Primo ] Oh, money? Please, what would I do with money? Thank you. I have to go now. Thank you for the painting. Well, this is the biggest one. Good night. Good night. Good night, Stash. Good night, Secondo. See what he give us, huh? Look, it's landscape. See? Don't you love it? Great. Put it with the rest of them. Primo, let me ask you something. What do you think if we take risotto off the menu? Primo? What do you think about that, huh? Take risotto off the menu. I'm sorry. What did you say? Forget it. No, no, I don't hear what-what you say. Tell me what you say. Well, it's just that... risotto costs us a lot. And it take you a long time to make. I mean, you have to work so hard to make, you know? And then, we have to charge more, so... I think take it away. Sure. Good. Really? Yeah, that's good. Oh, yeah. Okay. All right. Maybe, instead, we could put-- Yes, tell me, tell me. Well, I was thinking-- Hmm, what, what do they call it? You know, it's-- Come se dice? Manicotti? No. Is a hot dog? Hot dog. Hot dog! Yeah, hot dogs. [ Sighing ] Maybe people would like that. Those. Fine. If you give people time, they learn. Well, I don't have time for them to learn. This is a restaurant, not a fucking school. ** [ Jazz ] [ Car Honking ] [ Door Closing ] It's busy again tonight. The man should be in prison for the food he serves. People love it. Good night.

I like to pick the right one. But don't take too long. Someone else might pick the one you want. [ Chuckling ] Good night. [ Chattering in Italian ] Why would Secondo say you said something and you say you said nothing? Salute. No, no-no, no. W-W-What's the matter? Phyllis, no, I can't. You can't. Why? I can't. No, I can't. Honey, I can't. Why? Why? No, I can't. I don't want to. I just get sad. Sad? - Yes. - Honey, "sad" is the wrong word. Well, no, I don't mean sad, but I mean, you know, it just, it gets me all jazzed up, you know? And then I want to go to my place, but I can't go there. Well, you know, I have to go crazy. [ Chuckling ] We don't have to-- I mean, you know, we've done other things. I know, I know, I know. Well, so what's the problem? I know. I just want it to be-- I can't, I can't.

We're not-- It's not for me a casual thing, you know, like, oh, it's okay, like that. It's not like that. I know it's not like that for you either. I want it to be, you know, when the time is right. I mean, you know, because now, everything is just too much, and I just can't-- [ Sighs ] I just-- I want it to-- I want us to be when I am more set. Set? Yes. Oh, so it's about finances. Well-- It's about money. No, Phyllis, it's not about money, okay? [ Sighs ] And don't make it sound like that. It's not like that. 'Cause I am here working, trying to do something. It's very hard. And then you know, my brother's driving me crazy. Okay, I'm just saying that, uh, it's about money, yes, okay. I'm sorry you don't understand money. Oh, yeah, I don't understand money. I work in a bank. What did you say? [ Chuckling ] I understand money. Ah, good. Honey, I just-- All I want is for the time to be right, okay? I know. And I want it to be right for you. And the time, it is not right for you. Okay? You understand what I mean? You know, I don't think you know what you want. I really don't. What do you mean? What? What do you want? You know exactly what you want? What do you want, huh? What do you want me to do? Want me to ask you to marry you right now? Oh, is that a proposal? - Uh, no, well, no. - Do you want to marry me? Do I want to marry you? Yeah. Yes, probably, someday, yes. In the future I want to marry you, but not right now. Thank you very much, but not right now. I'm sorry. Okay. What? Nothing. Just forget it. I don't know. [ Sighing ] I'm so tired. Yeah, it's very late. ** [ Jazz ] [ Chattering ] Hey, how are you? Is he here? Yeah, I don't know, in the back. [ Laughing ] Hey, Joe.

But I am not just me. I am me and my brother. You know, so-- So you guys are not even thinking about coming to work for me. With me. I should say with me. No-no-no-no, believe me, I think about it, but-- Ah, I see you thinking. You know, and I am flattered, but my brother has ideas, you know. Ideas is ideas. I have to convince him to come here, to have our own place. Oh, yeah? Because I know in Italy, you work hard... and there is nothing. But here, you work hard, and... [ Singing ] Hey. Right? I know. Hey, that is why we all come here, huh? It's the land of fucking opportunity, right? But you can't come here and expect the figs... the first year you plant the goddamned tree. No matter who you are. You know what I'm saying? Believe me, I know. I know. That's exactly what my brother said. It's funny. Yeah, but, Seco, may I say something that I learned, without being too big? A guy goes out to eat in the evening... after a long day in the office, whatever. Go ahead. He don't want on his plate... something that he has to look and think, "What the fuck is this"? What he want is steak. This is a steak. I like steak, you know? Mmm, I'm happy! Do you see what I mean? But don't get me wrong. I think that your brother is good, goddamned chef. Maybe the best I ever see. He is the best. Yes, but, this is what I have to say to you. Give to people what they want. Then later, you can give them what you want, eh? Pascal, believe me, I know, I know. Hey, fucking guy. You and your brother, you come to work with me. I know, but-- Okay. Okay, but, uh, the kind of money you ask me for, I can't lend to you. That's okay. I understand. And I'm sorry-- You know, everything has just... become... too much. Hey-hey-hey, fucking guy, what is this "too much," eh? Hey, it is never too much! It's only not enough! Bite your teeth into the ass of life... and drag it to you! Hey! [ Sighs ] Well, that is why I come here to you, you know? Oh, no-no-no-no, you don't need money.

I sent the champagno, the best, to him, at his hotel. Compliments of Pascal. That's it, on my card, like that. Compliments of Pascal. By hand, I write, huh? Two days later, I get that picture of him, signed to me. See? Ah. [ Chuckling ] Now look at that picture there. Go on. Six months later, [ Chuckling ] who do you see, huh?

Great. That sounds, yes, great. [ Chuckling ] I just have to talk to my brother, but it should be-- But no, it's good. I'm sure I can do. No problem. I do. I make a call. I set him up, okay? Okay. - You know Gabriella? - Oh, yes, hello. Hi. Pascal, grazie. Baby, listen. I am for you like one of those things with the lights. What? With the ships in the storm with the lights. What do you call it? I don't know. The lighthouse. The lighthouse! That's what I am for you. If it rain, you look for me. I show you the way home. Okay. Suppose he doesn't want to go home? What do you mean? He's in the fucking rain. Some people like the rain. Gabriella, go check the menus, please. Pascal, let me ask you something. Hey. Buona sera. If my brother know that you, uh-- Please. That cradle will not be rocked by me. I tell nothing. This is all yours. Okay, okay. Mille grazie. Hey, you kidding? I love secrets. Secrets make the friendship stronger. Buona notte. Grazie. Ciao, Leo, ciao. * Buona sera, signorina Buona sera * [ Secondo ] That son of a bitch fish man, you see how he changes song?

Your brother like cars, Secondo? [ Chuckling ] No, my brother, he does not even drive. Well, some people prefer to walk. I tell you, my brother make one ride... from Italy to America.

Someone get you a compliment, you say "thank you." Grazie. Prego. Pascal bought a boat. That mean you're gonna sail away? Maybe... if the sky is red in the morn-- No, the sun is red-- No, the sky is-- What is the rhyme? [ Mutters ] Yeah, when is the good one? Red sky at morning mean it will rain outside. [ Laughs ] What about rain inside? Huh? [ Chuckles ] Huh? Nothing. No, what you mean? You say "rain outside," and I think for you to use the word "outside" is funny. Why? Because it can't rain inside. I no say "inside." I say "outside." I know. No. I know. So where is the problem? I don't get it. Well, you don't have to say "outside," because it can't rain inside. What the fuck? I know it can't rain ins-- Forget it, forget it! What the fuck is he talking about? I'm confused. No, I make fun. You make fun of your brother. No, I make like a joke. I don't hear the joke. Well, it's not-- [ Sighing ] I make a toast. No for me. It's too early. It's never too late. [ Chuckles ] So this is to tonight, the big night... Ahh. when I bring together... my old friend Louis Prima with my two new friends. You guys are simply the best. Salute. Salute, salute, salute.

Well, I told you. [ Pascal Laughs ] Come on, I know everybody. There's nobody I don't know. Hey, hey, Primo, huh? Let's have another-- Wait-- [ Primo Walks Off ] Oh, fuck. I fucked up. Oh, I'm so sorry. Do you know what goes on in that man's restaurant every night? Rape! Rape! That is what goes on in that place every night! The rape of cuisine! But wh-what happened? What happened? Please, please, please, please. - What's wrong? - Nothing. This eggplant is no good. It's too thick. And if I cook it like this, too thick, it's too heavy, I can't use it. That's how your brother told me to cut it. My brother was wrong! Okay, he was wrong! What do you want me to say? Okay? He was wrong! Can you believe it? People make mistakes. That's what they do. You should know that, okay? When someone gives you advice, you should think that maybe... they're making a mistake. Okay? What you need to do is decide for yourself what it is you want. Okay? You understand? Exactly what you want. And then I won't have to throw every goddamn thing away! Okay! Oh, my God! I really think you need to be by yourself for a while. [ Clattering ] Phyllis? Phyllis? Great! [ Speaking Italian ] [ Chattering ] Okay, you like it? Okay, these should be what he wanted. Yeah. If there's a problem, he can call me. Take that inside. But we will see you tonight, huh? The party. My brother invite you, right? N-No, he didn't. [ Sighs ] Signorina, my brother wants you to come. But sometimes he's too-- Uh... you know? Yes.

Cristiano, come here, please. Go outside and watch for Louie Prima, okay. I don't know what he looks like. Uh, here, here. Like that. Okay, go. He says, "Ah, it was the first day with milk." [ Speaking Italian ] Ah! Hey, what you got there? [ Laughing, Chattering ] Help yourself. Anything you want. Cristiano, take care of my friend. Cristiano, right? Do you have a car? Here. Cheers to you. Eat this. Come on. Drink that. Ah, the reporter. Listen, help yourself to anything you want. I'll be back. I'm Jameson, Daily Sun. How are you? Are you El Segundo? Gabriella's friend? Secondo, Secondo. Nice to meet you. Glad to know you. Is Mr. Prima here? No, he's not here yet, but he will be here soon. Is Gabriella here? She's not here, either. Please, come in. Can I fix you a drink? Something? An appetizer. Well-- I don't think you can say, if I do this, then that will happen. I mean, you can. But if you did that all the time, where would you be? Personally, I think, nowhere. This is focaccia, which is nice. We make that earlier today, my brother and I. This is a nice crostini. Excuse me, don't mean to touch with my fingers. That's okay. This is nice. Inside is olive oil and goat cheese. [ Speaking Italian ] - The flower lady. - What? Hello, how are you? So nice to see you. I'm good. Thank you. Thank you for coming. You look beautiful. Thank you for inviting me. Watch the stove. [ Chattering, Laughing ] Oh, big brother! Here you go. Oh, thank you. How are you? [ Laughing ] Look at you. [ Laughing ] Hello. Hello. Uh-- Oh, my God. I'm so glad... you-- Now you can see where go your beautiful flowers. Yes. Yes. Did you see behind the bar? They're all over. Gorgeous. Lovely restaurant. I love all the, um... paintings. Oh, yes. Show the lady. Show me-- Oh. Yes. Yes! All right. We start here with this one. Here, my aunt and nephews. She asked me what are the favorite things I like. * Buona sera, signorina buona sera * * It is time to say good night to Napoli * * Though it's hard for us to whisper buona sera * * With that old moon above the Mediterranean sea * * In the morning, signorina we'll go walkin' * * Where the mountains of the sun come into sight * * And by the little jewelry shop we'll stop and linger * * While I buy a wedding ring for your finger * * In the meantime let me tell you that I love you * * Buona sera, signorina kiss me good night * ** [ Scatting ] * Buona sera, signorina buona sera * * It is time to say good night to Napoli * * Though it is hard for us to whisper buona sera * * With that old moon above the Mediterranean sea * * Mmm, in the mornin' signorina, we'll go walkin' * * Where the mountains of the sun come into sight * * And by the little jewelry shop we'll stop and linger * * While I buy a wedding ring for your finger * * In the meantime let me tell you that I love you * [ Cheering ] What a crowd! You know Gabriella, right? Yes, yes, sure. Phyllis, you're a vision of loveliness. Thank you. Phyllis, you know Gabriella, Gabriella, Phyllis. Phyllis is Seco's... fiancee? No. No, not quite. What are you waiting for? A sign from above? [ Laughter Continues ] He's like my mother, this one. Come on. Am I right? I love this guy! [ Growling ] Look at that goddamn table. It's nice, huh? It's the Last fucking Supper! Ha, ha, ha, ha! We are just waiting for the guest of honor now. Forget about it. Don't worry, he'll be here! Where's your brother? I'll say hi. I see him! Hey! Hey, Primo! So, uh-- Wait. I'll come with you. * Oh, oh, baby Hurry, oh, oh, baby * Annie. I love that corsage! Oh, thank you. * Oh, oh, baby * * Hurry, oh, oh, baby * * Hurry, oh, oh, baby * Gabriella. You know Ann, yes? * Ooh, ah, ooh, ah * * Ee, ooh, ooh, ooh * [ Speaking Italian ] Secondo, it will be fine, eh? Is a party, no? Is fun. Good. Oh, Mr. Fun, Mr. Fun. ** [ Continues ] Come here. Come here. Don't worry about everything. It's going to be fine. I'm not worried about anything. Have a little sip of my drink. Cheers. [ Growling ] He plays the trumpet. He sings. Isn't he-- They call him "The Lip." Hey, where did you go? Just going to take test-drive. Be right back. Okay. More scotch? Here. Take the bottle. It's a fiorentina sauce, but quick, fresh, nice. Ah, see? Sometimes you can put in cream, if you like, but not for me. It's no good for my stomach. My mother cooked cream everything. Have you ever been to Bologna? No. Oh. I take you someday there. I mean, you like cream? Yes. Yes? I thought you do. Yes, yes, well. You will love this place. Bologna is sad, a little. The city is old. No, old is nice, but is dark. But the food! They make there a dish called lasagna. Lasagna. Lasagna bolognese. You can't believe how good this is. And when my uncle, in Rome, at this restaurant, when he make this... you eat and then you go and... you kill yourself, you have to kill yourself. After you eat this, you can't live! Okay, smell. Smell. Ohhh! Is nice, huh? That smells good. Okay, this is done. All right. Now, taste. Taste. Ooh! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Is good, huh? You like? Oh, my God. "Oh, my God" is right, see? Now you know: To eat good food is to be close to God. You know what they say? To know God-- To have the knowing-- The knowing? Knowledge. Knowledge? Si. The knowledge of God is the bread of angels. I'm never sure what that means, but is true anyway. [ Laughing ] [ Choking, Coughing ] [ Coughing Continues ] Thank you. Take deep breaths. [ Breathing, Clearing Throat ] You know how they get you, these people? Men? Boys? They make you think they have secrets they will tell. But they have nothing to tell. And then they talk. And they talk, talk, talk, and they keep talking. And what do they say? Nothing. Right. And then they smoke, and then they talk some more. And then, that's that. Have you ever been to the West? Out west? Mm-hmm. Yes. Really? They say it's beautiful. Yes. Very beautiful. A little too vast for me. Too what? Vast. Spacious. Big. Oh, vast! Yeah. How do you feel? I feel better. Want a puff? Thanks. So you prefer it here, east? Yeah, I do. I see. Maybe I should go out west. Find a cowboy with a horse. The whole thing. What do you think? [ Laughing ] A cowboy. Yeah, I want one. Strong. Silent. Like a statue. Cool. Always there. Cowboys are consistent. * A girl went back to Napoli * * Because she missed the scenery * * The native dances and the charming songs * * But wait a minute * * Something's wrong * ** * Ay, mambo * * Mambo Italiano * * Ay, mambo * * Mambo Italiano * * Go, go, go * * You mixed-up Siciliano * * All you calabrese do the mambo like a-crazy * * Well, ay, mambo * * No more tarantella * * Ay, mambo * * No more mozzarella * * Ay, mambo * * Mambo Italiano * * Try an enchilada with the fish baccala * * Ay, mambo * * I love-a how you dance the rhumba * ** [ Music Continues ] Phyllis, what are you doing? Oh, Gabriella, hello. How are you? Hi, hi. [ Laughing ] [ Horn Tooting ] What a fucking ride! [ Laughing ] [ Growling ] Come on, Bobby. Let's get a drink. * And ay, citrull' * * You don't-a have to go to school * * Just think-a with a beat bambino * * It's-a like vino * * You're-a good lookin' but you don't know what's cookin' * * Ay, mambo Mambo Italiano * * Ay, mambo Mambo Italiano * * Oh, ho, ho * * You mixed-up Siciliano * * It's-a so "delish" Everybody can capisci * * How to mambo * * Italiano * * 'Atsa nice ** [ Cheering ] Ay, Primo's cooking! Let's eat. [ Cheering ] Oh! This is the green one that my brother has made especially for you. This is the pesto. This is regular risotto. And this is seafood risotto. That one. This one? Can I come back for more? No, absolutely not! What do you think? Do you think he'll make it? Louie Prima? Yeah. He'd better make it. He don't know what he's missing. Eat and taste it. You'll like it. You want some? Okay. - For you, sir. - For me? No, save this one for Louie Prima. Okay? Okay. Okay. [ Mutters In Italian ] Um... maybe too hot, still. No, no. We have to serve now. Okay. Okay. No! Wait. Cut it at the table. Okay. Okay. Okay. I worry it's going to be too hot. It's going to fall apart. That's what I say. Is it too hot? We don't have time. Let's go. Come on. Cristiano, open the door. ** [ Continues ] What is that? A timpano. It's a secret recipe they brought from their hometown. I only heard about it. I never had it. [ Woman ] Bellissimo! Bellissimo! [ Man ] It's good, huh? My God. Goddamn it! [ Gasping ] [ Music Stops ] Goddamn it. I should kill you. This is so fucking good I should kill you. [ Laughing ] Paradise! [ Cheering ] ** [ Singing In Italian ] ** [ Woman Weeping ] What's the matter? My mother was such a terrible cook. ** [ Piano ] ** [ Woman Humming ] ** [ Piano, Humming Continue ] Listen, um... I'm gonna try and get someone out here to write a review. But that could take awhile. Oh. I-I can't do the story about Louie Prima, because... he didn't show up. Ah. But you were right. It was the best. Ever. Thank you. I gotta go. Okay. What time do you have? It's 3:00. Good night. Good night. Good night. One, two, three. Now, careful, because... if it's too much wind they fall over. [ Whispering ] Careful, careful. And they go up. Isn't that beautiful? Listen, baby, uh, I don't know what to say. I'm so fucking embarrassed. I'm sorry. But you know what? These people had a... a great, goddamn time. You should be proud, like hell. Everything'll be okay. Hey, we'll... we'll talk tomorrow. Yeah, mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. You cannot be caught with the ring. You must lie, and cheat and swear and kick. Come, come and stand in a circle. Okay, everyone take. Take the string. So, we're not supposed to know? You're supposed to-- Trick! Trick the person. Now, everyone, stand in a big round-- Good, good. Now, Ann, you start. You go in the middle first. Me? Go on. [ Laughing ] Close your eyes. Do we say we have it? Are we supposed to say we have it? You must lie. Lie and cheat? Okay. [ Laughing, Chattering Continue ] [ Speaking Italian ] [ Laughter, Voices Overlapping ] I don't have it. I got it right here. Take it. Take it. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, you! Oh! I don't! I don't! Where are you going? I've gotta go. I'm going. Gabriella, stick around. Yeah, we're waiting for Louie Prima. Don't hold your breath. What? What do you want with me? Hmm? Why don't you tell your new friend about who's coming tonight? Hmm? What-- What do you say? Tell him. He worked very hard. Come on. Okay, okay. What? No, we should go now. Let's go. Tell your new friend. Come on. No, come on. Let's go. No one is coming tonight. No one was ever coming. [ Speaking Italian ] [ Door Closes ] There! He's got it! [ Waves Crashing ] Phyllis! Phyllis! Come here. What are you doing? Come here! Phyllis! Come here. You'll catch cold. I want to talk to you. Oh, my. Phyllis. What are you doing? Ph-- Phyllis, come here. I want to talk to you. Come here. Please! I was just upset and she just-- No! Don't do that. I hate that. Okay. Okay. - Can I just talk to you-- - No. I'm not here anymore. He's no coming. Seco. What? Pascal never called. What do you mean? Pascal never called. So he's no coming. How do you know this? Gabriella. Pascal lied to you. He lies. Where is everybody? I should go say something. Come on. No. No, no, no, no more! Secondo. [ Speaking Italian ] Just listen. [ Speaking Italian ] Good. Good. Okay. Good. Good. You go. I'm going to stay here. No, no. No, no, no, no, Secondo. No. No, no. You go. Okay? Fuck him, and fuck you. You go back. You let somebody else take care of you. Okay? Okay. Okay, good. Go. Stay. No, go. Stay. Good, good. Stay! Stay. Go. Go. [ Speaking Italian ] You! You! You are the one! You are the one! What do you think? Do you think things are so simple? Do you think it is just like this and like that, and that's all it is? Is that what you think? Is that what you think? No. [ Speaking Italian ] We were dying, and I did something! [ Groaning ] For two years, I have been doing it all! What are-- While you have done nothing! What are you doing? I asked for your help. I need you to sacrifice. Ha, ha! And what do you do? You give to me nothing! Nothing! Is that what you think? That I give to you nothing? Yes, that is what I think. [ Shouts ] [ Speaking Italian ] [ Wailing ] Primo. Basta, Primo. [ Woman Laughing ] Hey, Secondo. Great party, even if... you know. Can I take you somewhere? No, no, no. Thanks, though. Okay. See you. ** [ Piano ] I used to play at one time. You ruined me. Because of a woman? Oh, please, Seco. Be serious. Why? Because I wanted to save you. And then we would go with you? Where else would you go? What I did, I did out of respect. He's a great investment, you know, your brother. You too, of course. You will never have my brother. He live in a world above you. What he has, and what he is... is rare. You are nothing. I'm a businessman. I'm anything I need to be at any time. Tell me, what exactly are you? [ Door Opens, Closes ] [ Birds Chirping ] Are you hungry? I'll do it. [ Whispers ] Here. Hm. [ Clears Throat ] [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] Closed-Captioned By Captions, Inc.
