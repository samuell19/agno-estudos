Ben. That's too heavy for you. Just wait for your dad. Okay. Just put it by the table. I wanna see it. - Or just drop it right there. - Ashley! It's okay. Sweetie. We just have to put it back in because if Santa steps on one of these ornaments he might just drop off your gifts next door. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Want to spin? Yeah. - Yay! - Yay. Dad! There's decay feeding on fear. Hate. Death. Death is everywhere. No one is immune. I see the pain you've given me as a gift. Once you give in... things become much easier. What else has it told you? Look at me. Jacob. What else has it told you? Pray for you doctor. Last night. The rake spoke your name. What is the rake. Jacob? It's too hard to describe. Doctor. Murphy's entity draws inspiration from that of the Native American Wendigo and the ancient Celtic Arrach. This disease attaches itself to willing or unwilling hosts and grows inside effectively. Leeching off of his or her life. Jacob believes he must appease this entity by bringing harm to himself and infecting those around him. Benny. What are you doing out here? Oh. Hey. Dad. Mom needs you. How long have you been listening? I. Uh... Listen. Buddy. You don't need to hear this. It's grown-up stuff. Okay? Okay. Dad. It's cool though. I'm not scared of monsters anymore. Oh. I forgot you're ten now. You can't be scared. - Nope. - Okay. Go tell Mom I'll be down - in a minute. Okay? - Okay. Dad. All right. Death is everywhere. No one is immune. It will infect us all. Oh. Nice! All right. Benny. Dude. You're up. - Oh. This is gonna be tough. - Okay. Yeah. You know. I'm gonna help you focus here. - Oh. Yeah. That's helping me? - Mm-hmm. Oh! Okay. Guys. Game over. You know what that means. Right? Bedtime. But I'm not even tired! Goodnight. - Goodnight. Dude. - Goodnight. - You okay. Buddy? - Yeah. What you saw earlier... forget about it. Okay? Part of my job is to help people with the things they make up. - You understand? - I get it. Dad. It's like your comic books. It's all make-believe. Got it. - Love you. Buddy. - Love you too. You let him in your office? No. He just. Um. Peeked in for a second. That's all. A second is all it takes. David. You're right. I'm sorry. It's okay. Just keep the door locked from now on. Okay? I will. I... I've just been pounding my brain over this one. Oh. Sweetie. Uh. I know. I... I can tell. You'll figure it out. You always do and that's why I love you... Dr. Warren. I got to go clean up. Okay. Don't keep me waiting. Okay. What are you doing? I heard scary noises in my room. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. - You can't look at this. - Come on. I wanna see. Nobody knows where it comes from but it's always there... watching over while you sleep. Waiting for you to open your eyes for the last time. It stalks its prey. It hides and watches you without you even knowing. It waits for the perfect moment when you're least expecting. It's got one hooked claw and the other hand has nails so big - they look like butcher knives! - Stop! You're such a baby. Do you want me to stop? You're scaring me. I don't like this story. Okay fine. I'll stop. I told you were too young for this stuff. Oh. Ben? You gotta be kidding me. Seriously. David! David! It's here. It's always here. - David! - What was that? Stay back! Go to your room! The Rake is a disease that needs no motive. Once you give in... What's going on? - Listen to me. Listen to me. - Mommy. You have to stay here. Okay? Be very quiet. - I'm going to get help. - Mommy. Just be quiet. Okay? Okay? Okay? Okay? Stay quiet. Okay? - I love you. - Mom? David! David! David! ...traumatizing but... ...what came out of her... In conclusion. Jacob's obsession with the Rake could be seen as a supernatural hallucination. Cassie! Beyond compare... it convinced me to come to the despair. I see the pain you've given me as a gift. Once you give in... death. Rebirth... giving and taking. It will infect us all. These scars are testament to my transformation. - Honey. - What? - Is everything okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. - Our new chapter. Right? - Right. - Ready? - Mm-hmm. Nah. Hold on. Let's do this the right way. There's something to be said about tradition. Looks like everything got here in one piece. - Where do you want to start? - I don't know. Tell me. - Where do you want to start? - Oh. Okay. I'm sorry. What were you just saying to me about tradition? ♪ Is this for real Or is this a dream? ♪ ♪ I find it hard Hard to believe♪ ♪ Don't wake me up Because it feels ♪ ♪ Because it feels ♪ There is so much shit in that barn. Like. Literal shit? Yeah. Like. Literal shit. Come here. - So. What do you think? - Mm... I definitely think it's a fixer-upper. But that's okay. - I'm used to those. - Oh! - Is that so? - Mm-hmm. Was I really that bad? No. Otherwise. I never would've said "I do." Point taken. Ouch. - I'm glad you did. - Me too. Stop distracting me. We got work to do. We got people - coming over tomorrow. - Okay. Okay. Boss. What time are they coming? Ben and Michelle said six and then Ashley... I don't know. Don't worry. It's going to work out. All right. There's my woman. How are you doing? - Good. - Good? Good. Swear to God that better be fucking God. - Hey. - Hey! We weren't expecting you so early. Did you have a friend drop you off? - Uh. I took a cab. - Great. Come in. Sorry about the mess. We were gonna have everything all cleared up by the time everyone got here tomorrow. It's so good to see you! Here. Thank you. That's very thoughtful of you. - What is it? - It's a spider plant. Native. Is it? I don't know. I just know they're. Like. Impossible to kill. Low maintenance. Come in. I'll show you around. We can put this away. Come on! I'm down to 14 today. I think. Half are for my anxiety. Mixed with a few anti-depressants. And the rest are basically horse tranquilizers... but still nothing holds a torch to the shit they were feeding me in the hospital. Well. That's progress then. Right? Yeah. No voices. - Well. That's good. - Yeah... I think so. I'm starting to sort my shit out. Signed up for school again. Well. Online courses. And I've been working part time as a florist. A florist. Really? I always thought you hated gardening. I did. I still do. I'm like the human version of herbicide. Probably should've consulted with Ms. Authority here first. But can't be choosy. I guess. It's. Kind of. Hard to get a job when you have no real work experience. Why is that? Well. After inpatient therapy I was a bit of a nomad. Can't really handle people. They can't really handle me. Thus the plants. Well. I guess it's kind of hard to plant your roots when you're constantly ripping them out. Did you really just make a plant metaphor? Yes. I did. - It was bad. - Yes. It was. But. You know. He's not wrong. It is. It's hard to start over when you're a drifter... to find friends. To find love. - Marriage and kids? - Uh-huh. - Yeah. Let's not go there. - Not the maternal type? Like you? No. Not really. Well. I'm just beat. All right? I'll give you guys some alone time. Honey. I love you. Ashley. It's... it's always good seeing you. - Thanks. - Hey. Um... thank you for reaching out. You know. Thanks for giving a shit. It wasn't the same without you. I mean. California was great for Andrew's career and everything but... I didn't like that it kept me from you. I'm really happy that you're here. Me too. Ah! Ow! Damn it. Oh. Fuck. That sucks. Hold on. Ah. Goodnight. Honey... we know it's the same story over and over again. It's just that I need you to be as relaxed as possible. And Ashley isn't exactly Zen. If you know what I mean. Do you know. What I was thinking about in the car ride? Tell me. I want to know my family again. I still remember when Dad brought Ben and Ashley home. Ashley screamed more than she spoke and... Ben didn't talk at all. It took me a really long time to gain their trust. Hey. Hey. You... you helped them through a difficult transition. We helped each other. We were isolated in California for so long... I just worry I'm not gonna be able to make up for that. Especially with Ashley. I am-- I want them around. Come here. Come here. No one can break you. - It's in you too. - It's in you too. Ash! Ashley! Ashley! Ash! Ashley. Where are you? Ashley! Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Ash? Ashley? Ashley. Are you down here? Ashley? Ash! Ashley. Oh. My God! Are you okay? What's wrong? Ashley! Are you okay? Tell me what's wrong. Ashley? Ashley. Is someone in the house? Back off. It's okay. You're home. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. Ashley. Ashley. Look at me. Ashley! Ash. Ash. Ashley. I thought Californians were early risers. Yeah. We figured. We'd take notes from your Hawks - and sleep in this season. - Oh. Shit. I come bearing gifts. And this is how you treat me? - Yeah. Good to see you. - Nice to see you. - Did she see me pull up? - No. I don't think so. - Man. The chair looks great. - Thanks. Ben? Oh. My God. What are you doing here? - Ah. Fuck! - Surprise. Ouch! Honey. Are you all right? Yeah. I think I caught it on a staple or something. - You all right? - Yeah. I'll live. It is so great to have you back home. Nicki. It's really great to be home. - Dad's old chair. - Mm-hmm. Oh. Come on. Keep it together. I was just trying to do something nice. No. Ben. It's really. Really sweet. I was just looking at pictures of us on this thing. When we were younger and... I can't believe you hung onto it for me. Thank you. Every child should have an heirloom. I guess. Yeah. What'd you keep? The adoption record. Framed it and hung it in my office. That's really nice. Uh. Where would you like this? Oh. Um... Oh. Wow! Look at that view. Yeah. Sure beats looking at your neighbors' building. Which is what we did a lot of in California. - This is nice. - I like it. You can just set that here. Right there. The house is coming together nicely. Yeah. Slowly but surely. First night in the new place? No. It's not that. Um... Ashley came in last night. That's great! Where's she at? She's still sleeping. She. Um. Sort of had an episode. Yeah. She was screaming bloody murder in the basement. She had a night terror. It was bad. Ben. I haven't seen her like that even as a kid. It was different like more-- more real. I thought you said she was improving. Yeah. She was. Uh. I'm going to head out. I'll talk to you guys later tonight. Ben. Ben. Come on. Just stay for a little bit. - Come on. Dude. Stay. - No. I can't. We'll talk more tonight. Ben. That was weird. - Hope he's okay. - Yeah. Morning. It's 3 p.m. Where's Nicole? Making up for lost sleep. She didn't need to stay up with me. Seriously? Didn't you and Ben coin the phrase Mama-Sis? Touché. She always hated it. Though. Said it sounded like incest. It was a panic attack. - What? - In the basement. I'll bet your friends in the psych ward loved that. Sorry. I didn't mean to upset anyone. Then I guess you're not responsible. Then. I mean. Look you know what she's been through. Ash. Just be present for Nicole... or leave before you cause any more damage. Not a problem. Do you need something? Um. No. I just-- I wanted to know if you were okay. I'm fine. Thanks. Ashley! Ashley. Wait! Where are you going? Ashley. Just talk to me for a minute. Please! I made a mistake. What are you talking about? - I'm not ready for this. - Who is really ready for anything in their life? I'm trying to create something here... something that we haven't had since Dad died. Please. I'm doing everybody a favor. Trust me. No. You trust me. You are a part of this. - I used to be. - Just stay the night. We'll start fresh in the morning. Andrew and I really-- Ashley. Ashley. Just stay until the end of dinner. That okay? Ben is going to be crushed if he doesn't see you. And then afterwards. If you still feel like you want to leave. I'll take you anywhere you want to go. G-- Graham. Yes. Okay. Okay. Gr-- Yeah. I know. I know. Graham! Will you just stop interrupting me for like a second? When I say that I need to decompress. Thank me in advance for sparing your life. Oh. Okay. Yeah. Sure try your little power play. See what happens. Huh? Let me tell you something. Graham. I've got two Masters. A loaded 9mil. And perfect 34B's. Any of which that could turn you and your prick inside out. So. Let's just say it together. Huh? Competence! Jesus Christ. Did you just threaten to smoke your partner? No. Just a memo between friends. - I'm glad we're not friends. - Oh. No. I like you. Just Graham. On the other hand... - Maybe. It's time to leave. - Leave? No. Leaving solves nothing. Honey. Tenacity wins. We don't need tenacity right now. We need a break. A break? Okay. You know. I don't think he's going to be calling anytime soon. - I think. He got the point. - Good. Because it'd just be really nice if you weren't glued to your phone all weekend. Monday through Friday is bad enough. Yikes! Take a chill pill. You know. I didn't mean it like that. It's fine. Just drop it. You know what. No. Just because Ashley is struggling with some shit. Doesn't mean you have to too. - Yeah. You're right. - Damn straight. I'm right. It took a little bit of time but you turned out okay. I'm proud of you. - Thanks. - Yeah. Can you just turn off this emo attitude? You're a lot stronger than you realize. You know. Just help her through this shit and show her how it's done. Hey. - This look okay? - Yeah. You look great. Hun. You're not her guardian angel. You know. She's a grown woman now. She should be able to take care of herself. But she can't take care of herself. - Why can't you accept that? - I did... years ago. They should've never released her from the hospital. She obviously needs a lot of supervision and help. How can you be so cold to her? Honestly. What has she ever done to you. Really? Nothing. It's just that she's bringing you down and it's pissing me off. Well. You have a really shitty way of showing your concern for my well-being. I just-- I don't know why you didn't let her go when she wanted to leave. Because she's my sister. - She's not your sister. - Hello? - Where is everyone? - Hello? - Andrew? - Hey. - You look good. Ash. - Whatever. You look happy. I'm trying. One day at a time. You know? Andy. Get your ass out here! Ah. There he is! - Here I come. - All right! Here I come. Howl with me! Brother. I will make you howl. Jesus. It's been years. Man! How the hell have you been? I'm good. I've been good. Hey. I thought you said. You were going to bring someone. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Kim. She'll be around. Her shift ends at eight. Ah. Come on! Who cares? Great. Great. Come inside. Man. I got food on the way. It's-- Food? Jeremy need drink. A drink! A pint! A pint for brother Jeremy! A pint for brother Andrew! I don't know who this man is anymore. Andrew. The guy who once drank an entire bottle of tequila and tried to fight a rugby team... now wears Mr. Rogers sweaters and drinks grape juice. Huh! I'm sorry that my taste is too sophisticated for even you. Tell me. Did Nicole pluck your berries... or did they just shrivel up and fall off the vine? Okay. You know. My berries are just fine. Okay? Yeah. Says the guy who built his fucking wine rack before his love shack. - Oh. You know what. Fuck off! - You uncivilized savage. - Oh! I knew California would make you soft. Of course it would. All it is a bunch of fucking famous people and kale. And the ocean. And fresh fruit. The sun. And you traded all that for the winters of Siberia? Family is worth freezing for. Sure is. This one's nice. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. This was taken the day that Dad brought you and Ben home. Do you remember that? Just like yesterday. Welcome back. Nicole and Andrew. Bring on the bubbly! Please. Thank you. Oh. Uh... I shouldn't. Come on. Mama-Sis. One's not going to kill you. No fucking way! Wait. I don't get it. - I'm pregnant. - Yes! Oh. My God! Oh! Looks like the berries are hanging just fine - after all. Huh? - Congratulations. - Hey. Now it's a celebration. - Congrats to you two. Ashley? Aren't you excited? Ashley? What? You're going to be an aunt. Aren't you excited? Yeah. Sure. You just... - can't be happy for her? - Just let it go. Okay? - Andy-- - No! I'm interested. I'm interested. Is there any particular reason why you deem it necessary to. Yet again. Suck the fucking happiness out of the fucking room? I guess we opened that bottle of champagne a little too early. - Hey. Andrew. Relax. Man. - No. No. She's done nothing but scare my wife. My wife. Ever since she got here. You know what. Andrew. I am perfectly capable of speaking for myself. And that being said. You're acting like an asshole. I guess. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about then. Huh? She came out in pieces. What? Eighteen months ago... I was so weak that my doctors urged me to terminate her. They said she'd most likely come all fucked up... with holes in her brain or something worse. I was in a constant state of insomnia and paranoia so... I trusted them. I can still feel the cold steel as they pried me open... And smell the stench that filled the room as... they blended her up inside me... and vacuumed her out... like trash. Still want me to plan the baby shower? You're fucking pathetic. Why would she say something like that? Do you think that's the truth? Do you think it was too much too soon? - She's not used to crowds. - Or frat boys. I know. This whole night. God. I wish I could drink. Un momento. I think. I saw something in... Uh. Aha! Baby safe. You guys. This is still a celebration. Right? Babe. Babe. You're going to be an uncle. Yup. The three of us can still salvage the night. Right? Can you please take a moment and celebrate with your sister? You two start without me. I just need to clear my head for a bit. All right. You're not leaving until you have this toast with us. So. Beautiful. Thought of any names yet? You know. It's-- it's still early. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Okay. Bitch. You're glowing. All right? Just relax. You're going to be fine. - Come on. What do you've got? Okay. Um... if it's a boy. Andrew wants to name him Oliver. After his father. And if it's a girl... - I've chosen Savannah. - Savannah? Oh. My God. That's so hot. Guaranteed to be a pretty one. - To family! - To family. I'm sorry. I need to get some air. Oh. Congratulations. Ben... she'll be okay. Right? I would've been there. Ash. I highly doubt that. I went to the psych evaluations with you. The late night emergency room visits? And thought I was crazy. You were hurting yourself. Does this look familiar... to you? - Mom and Dad? Jacob Murphy? - Stop this. Ash. Please. You know what this is. - You saw it that night. - I saw Mom and Dad. I saw that maniac slit his own throat. There was something else in the house. Jacob Murphy has been dead for 20 years. It didn't end with Murphy. Okay. He was just a body. He-- he was just a vessel. One of many. Do you hear what you are saying? I wanted to keep my baby. Ben. But I had to save her from him. Not a man who died 20 years ago. You have to deal with your shit. You decided that child's life. It threatened to cut her out of me every time I slept. Have you been taking your pills? They make everything cloudy. I can't function! How long? Months. God! I need to hear that you're stable. That you're trying to get better. What happened to all the progress you made? After I did... what I did... it left me alone. I could sleep and eat again. No more whispers. It's getting stronger. In the family room just now. I heard it whispering to her. Savannah. Why do you still take your pills. Ben? Hm? - Are you afraid to dream? - It's not the pills. Ash. I grew up and I moved on. I'm living here now with Michelle and Nicole. Reality has no room for your rake. Neither does your family. Go fuck yourself. What do you want? Feeding on fear. Hate. Death... decay... Death is everywhere. No one is immune. Beyond compare... it convinced me... to come to the despair. I see the pain you've given me as a gift. Once you give in. Things become much easier... death. Rebirth... giving and taking... Ben? - Andrew! Jeremy! - Oh. My God! Just give in to it. You can trust me. It will infect us all. Where's Ashley? Babe. Look just try to lay down. Okay. And relax. You fell down the stairs and you may have a concussion. We're taking you to the hospital. - Ashley. Where is she? - She's back at the house. Ben. Probably chain smoking out back. Did anyone see her? I'm sure she's still pretty upset from what happened earlier. I said. Did anyone see her? Why are you freaking out? Something's happening to her... - she's not herself. - Yeah. Big surprise. - What are you talking about? - Turn the car around. Ben. You're really freaking me out. Just turn the fucking car around! Uncle Jeremy. I kind of like the ring to that. Does that mean your kid is going to bring me beers and shit? I'm having a child. Not a fucking servant. You want one so badly. Go make your own. Woah! No. No. No. No. Thank you. Kids are not my thing. Man. Let's just say. My sofa bed isn't the only thing that pulls out. You know. You were always so meticulous - with your words. Jeremy. - Oh. Come on! Worse things have definitely been said tonight. What was I supposed to say. Huh? "Ashley. My dear. Are you in need of re-admittance? Please. Take my tax dollars and find Jesus." Really? I'm an asshole? Because I told the crazy bitch she's acting like a crazy bitch? Even little Benny boy blue was in denial. - Shouldn't be your problem. Man. - Nicki needs to realize... you can't help someone if they don't want to be helped. - Fuck 'em! - Amen to that! I'm sorry. I'm not sorry... - But I'm sorry. - Amigo... it is me who is sorry. Yes! Bitch gets the booze! - Ha-ha! - Fuck it. I'm going to go take a piss. And I'm going to go out for a smoke. Mm. Try not to piss in your slippers. Grandpa. Where are you? Ah. There you are! Come to Daddy. Kimmy! Babe... we're all inside. What are you doing? Fogging up the windows without me? Babe! What are you doing? Squatting in the bushes? Come out. Come out. Wherever you are. You horny little bitch. Daddy is going to spank you. Getting warmer. Baby. I can hear you! Oh. My God. Ki-- Kim? Kim? Babe... Yo-- Oh. My God. Babe! - Where the hell are they? - Try Jeremy's number. - I don't have it. - Fuck! Ben. We are not in your head. Okay. So you're going to have to tell us. Why you're freaking out? Remember the nightmares Ashley and I used to have as kids? Of course... about the night your parents were murdered. Those nightmares never went away. - You told me they stopped. - I lied. I don't understand. Our nightmares suggested something else was in the house that night. Something that has stayed with us. How does that have anything to do with Ashley? She believes she is becoming its conduit. To do what? To infect us all. Okay. Are we seriously considering this as a possibility. Right now? She killed her baby to save it from this thing. Ben. Ashley was unfit to be a mother. She was just confused. Did you ever mention the name Savannah to her? - No. - She knew. Why would it whisper to an unborn child? It speaks to what it wants. Crazy bitch can check on herself. Ashley? Is that you? Ashley? What the fuck are you doing down here? No. No. No. No! Fuck! Ashley? Nicole! Ashley? Hey. Andrew! Ashley! - Andrew! - Stop yelling! Oh. My God. Will you go grab him some ice. Okay. Babe! What are you doing? Hey. Calm down! Look. I mean it. You're really starting to freak her out. All right. Let's just get this off of you. All right? Okay. Hey. Babe. Babe. Look. Stay with me. Okay? All right? Just get this off. All right. Just lean back. Just lean back. Relax. Okay. I'm going to find her. Thanks. I'm going to check outside. Graham. Your nuts better be falling off. How is that important? Huh. Really? Okay. Graham. Are you deliberately trying to piss me off? Shut up. Graham. Hey! Jesus Christ. Just give me a second! Okay. I'm sorry what? You know. I don't understand why I hired you when I can't delegate a God damn thing to you. You think what? HR? Are you fucking kidding me? Just do your God damn job! Do you believe her? Ashley? Yeah. Do you trust her? How else would she know what she knows? Ben. I love Ashley to pieces. But what if Andrew is right? She's not wrong. Nicole... something is off. I've seen... I felt something here too. I lost my baby boy at nearly 19 weeks. I will do everything in my power to make sure this baby comes into this world safely. Even if that means losing a sister. Nicole! - Ben! Ben! - Nicole! Ben! Oh. My God! Nicole! Come on. Leave him. Leave him. We have to find Michelle. Michelle! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Michelle! Come on. Get off. Ben. Do you have your keys? We could drive out of here right now! Ben! Ben! We have to leave. We have to go! What should we do? Ben! Ben! We have to go now! What are you doing? No. No. Please stay with me and please don't leave me. Keep the door closed and stay quiet. Ashley? Ashley! Ashley! Ashley? Ashley? Ashley! I will not let you have her! It's in you too. - Ashley! Ashley! - No! - Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! - No! Ashley! Ben? What are you doing? Ben? Oh. My God. Oh. My God. Ben... No! No! Ben. No! Ben. Oh. My God... Oh. God! Oh. God! No! No. No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Oh. God! Oh. God! Oh. God! Oh.
