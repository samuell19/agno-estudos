"Embrace me..." [HUMMING] [HUMMING] Welcome friends! I'm here to narrate to you... ...a fantastic story whose essence is love. Friends, let me tell you such a story... ...in which the impossible becomes possible... ...in which a king finds his lost queen and an old man, his youth. There was a scientist by the name Khurana... NARRATOR: ...who was a little forgetful and a bit crazy. For 25 years he worked on a formula that restores youth to the old. Eureka! Found it! One drop of this will make a person younger by 25 years. NARRATOR:Let us see a live demonstration... ...how Khurana's formula has done the unimaginable! One drop of this will knock 25 years off. A duck will become the egg that it once was. Khurana has only two confidants who knew his secret. One, his secretary Kavita, and the other, a talking parrot. Take the medicine. The duty of the talking parrot was... ...to remind the forgetful Khurana his every work. But the secretary Kavita proved to be a traitor. Khurana wanted to gift his formula to the Indian government. But Kavita schemed to leak it to Khurana's twin, a mafia don. What? My son, Baljeet! Baljeet, the don's eldest son, is corrupt and utterly selfish. Dad, this is the day that I've been waiting for. Now on we will deal not in billions but in trillions. Shut up! I shall not give it to anyone... ...whatever be the amount offered. Only I will use the formula and become young. What foolishness is this, dad? I am not being foolish. [INDISTINCT] Good morning dad. Now meet his second son. He is Sunny, whose genes seem to have got jumbled up. Today my love and life Tanya is going to perform. That's why I am going early to college. Wish me good luck. You fool, learn to speak your language properly. Don always had a suspicion that Sunny... ...is not his own son. He carried a notion... ...that his second wife wanted to confess on her deathbed... ...that Sunny happened because of her affair... ...with her neighbour Subramaniam. NARRATOR: Baljeet deceived his father. And offered to sell the formula to a Chinese gang. The gang gave him an advance of 50 crores... ...and told Baljeet to give them the formula in three days. Now let us put the formula and these plots aside... ...and come to the love story. He studies in the college and works in a canteen too. A simple lad by the name Karan... ...with no one to call his own. Murugan, who too works in the canteen, is his only kin. Give this burger, these pastries and this sandwich... ...to that fat girl sitting outside. That fat girl eats a lot. But we earn our living only because she does that. Said it right, your honesty is your undoing. Sunny, Tanya's show is about to begin. Come fast. No! Rascal! Speak softly. Otherwise everyone will turn up at her show. Did you see that? Come on guys let's go for the show. Come on. Yes Come on. NARRATOR: Not just Sunny but the entire college is obsessed with Tanya. Karan too loves her... within himself... Don't you want to go to Tanya's show? No. You like her a lot, don't you? - Yes. - Let's go. Just give it a thought Murugan. We are poles apart. I work in this in small canteen. But the entire college is mad after her. She doesn't even know my name. How can she... till you get to know each other. Come on now. - No, Murugan. - Let's go. [CHEERING] "I have something for me to tell my love" "I feel something come on me when I'm around with you" "You and only you" "You and only you" "I can't take my eyes off you or live alone without you." "You are the throb of my heart." "I wanna sing with you, dance with you" "Be with you forever" "I wanna sing with you, dance with you" "Be with you forever" "You rest in my eyelids." "You are my obsession." "Your lovely face fills my vision." "You and only you" "Your name dances on my lips." "It is your beauty that my words depict." "My thoughts are filled with your remembrance..." "...from my breath exudes your fragrance." KILLER JEANS singer of the year award goes to Tanya Moolchandani. Come on people, lets give her a big hand. "Love is true to me I know it's true" - Take this. - Give my goggles back! Give my goggles back! Catch it. Somebody please help me. They've taken my goggles. One second. - Give it back. - It is going to be a problem. Leave him... leave him... What are you doing? We are playing the goggle game. Want to join? It is not good to trouble someone like this. Not giving my goggles. Who are you? Are you the brother of this mad guy? Are you a college hero? Tell me, burger... Is he your brother? Is this mad guy your brother? Is this mad guy your brother? He is my brother. Sister... Oh God! Sister, he snatched my goggles. This moustached guy robbed my goggles. He is a dirty man. This one is a good guy. Tanya, sorry. We didn't know that he is your brother. Thousand apologies... Brother-in-law, take these goggles. Shut up! Just get out of here! - But, Tanya... - I said get out. Okay, I'll see you later. Come on boys, she really loves me. How did you come out of the house? From the rear window. Because I couldn't trace my cycle. Golu, how many times should I tell you... ...not to come alone out of the house like this? - Sorry, sis. - It's okay. Say thanks to Karan. Thanks, Karan. Do you know my name? I also know that you came last in the first year exam. Just kidding! You are a scholar... ...and along with studies you work in the canteen too. This is how the friendship started. Karan wanted it to bloom. What better chance than a private birthday bash! NARRATOR:He invited her and Tanya too obliged. A green signal from her side! NARRATOR: He cooked delicious food, lit the candle and waited... He bought new pants and shirts. Tanya too did some birthday shopping for Karan. Their hearts were just about to unite... ...when villains played spoilsport. The scientist locked the formula in a closet... ...told its code to his parrot... and forgot it! 7861. 7861. Baljeet came to his uncle to cheat him off his formula. But the scientist tricked Baljeet and ran away with his parrot. Baljeet then saw how things stood. The formula in the locker... ...and it's code with the talking parrot. Baljeet took his men and went looking for the scientist. [ENGINE REVVING] Open the door. What are you doing in my car? Who are you? - Get out of my vehicle. - I need... - I need help. Do good. - Come out of my car. Dear, do good... - What were you doing in it? - Do good. You will get good. - Listen. - Go from here. Hey madam. The scientist then saw what fell out of Tanya's purse. She left something behind. When he saw it up close... ...it was Tanya's credit card with her name on it. NARRATOR: Tanya felt sorry a little later. A man is in trouble, why shouldn't I go to help him. Well, she turned her car to go back to him... ...and was aghast to see the scene ahead of her. Baljeet saw the girl... ...and realized that a horrible thing happened. The girl saw him committing the murder... ...and she must be caught before she lets it out. He saw the credit card in the scientist's hand... ...and understood that the parrot was with a certain Tanya. Now I have to catch two girls in one night. One who has the parrot and another, who saw the murder. We must find the parrot. Go and search for it. When Baljeet saw Tanya's photo, he felt relieved. The two girls he wants are in fact one and the same! NARRATOR: Tanya ran to a police station... ...but the enemy was already there. Tanya secretly overheard their conversation... ...and realized that she has to flee from her home that very night. Karan waited and waited no end... ...but Tanya did not turn up that night. NARRATOR: Karan went to Tanya's house to inquire after her. Karan, who was unaware of the sinister plot of murder... ...went to Tanya's house but couldn't meet her. Tanya had already left with her brother Golu in dark... ...leaving Karan's love story high and dry. Later Karan searched everywhere he could... ...but couldn't trace Tanya. She just vanished in thin air! In this way the lovers parted ways. See for yourself if they will ever come together again. [CLOCK TICKING] Hey, what happened? Any succees with the locker? It is 3 years now... but they are still clueless about its code. The fruit is within reach but I can't have it! Hey, Baljeet! Why are you gaping like that? Search for that parrot and bring it. You have been searching for the parrot for the last 3 years. Get my Tanya for me and I will give you a grandson. Get lost, idiot! Go and get it... or don't show me your dirty face again. - You have come very late... - Okay... What is this!? A bill though I didn't eat anything!? Excuse me, here is your food... - Bill is mine. - Sorry. 'Experience the joy in giving a bill! ' You are mixing up your sandwich... ...with your bill. Are you out of your mind? I'm sorry. I got carried away a bit. A bit!? You have lost yourself since three years. You have ruined your life thinking about Tanya. Such a young and handsome guy you are! Tell me and I will get you not one but ten girls. But none like Tanya. And none is as smitten by love as you! Now take this bill and give it at the correct table. [CHUCKLES] - It's been so long. - Actually... [CHUCKLES] Excuse me! Yes. Sorry... I think you are from City College, right? Yes. - And you are Karan. - Yes. He's at it again! He's been doing it since 3 years. Inquiring all those who come here, about Tanya. - You are Tanya's friends, aren't you? - Yes. Do you know where Tanya stays at present? Yes. Tanya went to stay at her aunt's place in Delhi. So... Tanya is in Delhi. No, she was in Delhi two years ago. But now she settled with her aunt in Dubai. In Dubai! Do you know her address in Dubai? - No, we don't. - No idea. Sorry. Thanks. Thanks anyway. - Okay. - Murugan! - We are going to Dubai. - What!? Let's leave all this. Come here. Tanya is in Dubai. Let's go there. Is Dubai in the next street for us to go there in a jiffy? - Do you have a passport? - No, but I have a ration card. You get ration and not flight tickets with a ration card. But one can get a passport with the ration card. What now? Do you know that it takes 15 odd days to get a passport? Besides, Dubai is a huge city. How will you find Tanya there? Three years have passed. Isn't it possible that someone else entered her life? Come what may... ...even if it means that I have to spend... ...all my earnings, I want to meet Tanya just once. Okay, by the time that we get our passport and visa... ...I will get Tanya's Dubai address. How will you do that? I have a friend who imports items from Dubai... ...and sells them here. He has very good contacts there. He can help us. Where can we find him? "Come and give me a sweet kiss." "Take me into your arms in warm embrace." "Come and give me a sweet kiss."

Lala, what brings you here so suddenly? How are you? What else? I want money. If you don't return my money today, I'll cut your throat. - Hey, man! - Who is that? Let him go. He doesn't have another throat to spare. Leave him. Come here, brother. Who are you and what work do you have here? What can you do to me? Not me... all of us will do it. Well... who are your men? - Do you want to check out? - Yes. Kaliya, come here. Does that bring you down to earth? [INDISTINCT] I am not afraid of you. I am indebted to him. I am ready to take the blows. Raise the stakes one to ten. Hey, play the music he likes! Kutty, your man is a goner today... I stake double the money! C'mon... into the ring! - Rocky! - Come on my Kaliya. [GROANS] - Rocky! - Rocky! - Rocky! - Rocky! - Rocky! - Rocky! Come on. - Rocky! - Rocky! - Rocky! - Rocky! [CHEERING] One for you and one for me. - Two for you... and two for me. - Okay. - Three for you... and three for me. - Okay. - Fifty-fifty. Fair enough, isn't it? - Okay. - Happy? - Very happy. - No cheating. - No. If you feel cheated then take this and calculate yourself. No, you are great. - Brother Kutty! - Brother Murugan? Take this... - Brother Kutty! - Brother Murugan? - Welcome... - How are you? Doing fine? He is Karan. The one I told you about... ...who wants to search for his love in Dubai... - Yes! - He. There is a man who is most capable of doing that. - Who? - My name is Rocky. You are Karan and he is Murugan. You own a hotel but go out and eat elsewhere. He is younger and he, elder... and are like brother and sister. - Brother and sister!? - Want to know anything more? We want to know about Tanya and not about ourselves. I can tell you not just about Tanya but about her past... ...and future lives too. Tell me what you want to know? We just want to know about her present. Is she a maid who stole your money and ran away? No, she stole his heart and went off. Oh, I see! It is a matter related to the heart. It will be 15 to 20 days before we get our passports. We want you to go ahead of us and gather information... ...by the time we reach there. Any problem? - I'll take 25000. - 25000!? Okay. That's just the advance. Another 25000 after the work is done. - 50000!? - Yes. We want to know only about Tanya, and not about the whole of Dubai! Murugan, I am ready to pay. And pay 50000 after you meet Tanya. That'll settle it. Oh my gosh! 100000 in all! For that money, Tanya will herself come here and give her address. Okay, call her and take her address. We don't need your help. - Let's find someone else. - Murugan. You get me a beer. - Okay then. - No, this isn't how things are done. - I will give you 100 thousand rupees. - 100 thousand rupees?! Fine. How can I identify her? Now... Yes... I have just this. What is this? Does she look like this? No, not like this. Then what should I do with it, should I feed it chillies? Should I sing a song? This is new parrot. He talks. - Give me her photo. - Sorry, I don't have that. But I have her name... Tanya Moolchandani. Give this to her. She may recognize it. - Will she recognize this parrot? - Yes. What a strange love affair yours is! Okay, I'll do your work. Dubai... [AEROPLANE ENGINE REVVING] - Welcome to Dubai. - Any progress in your work? Lots! It goes on rent for 8 hours everyday. The girl goes on rent!? Oh, not the girl... I'm talking about my rental car business. It's doing pretty well. I am asking about Tanya. She has changed her name... she is Natasha now. I found this from the Indian embassy. Here is her address. You are quite fast at work these days. Very good. Come on, let us go. This bungalow is wonderful! That's the one we want. It has one balcony, two windows and one main gate. A tree too, though I don't know it's name... but I'll make a note. Are you a broker? We came here to investigate... ...and not to deal in real estate here. Leave this and take this. It is good that you brought this baton along. People here keep a lot of dogs, don't know why. This is a mic! Shall I say something into it? It's not for us to speak but to eavesdrop on others. Okay. Go in there. I will stand here and listen. Will you hear with this?! I will see with this... and hear with this. - Just go now! - Okay. [AEROPLANE ENGINE REVVING] SWEETY: - Natasha! - Here I come. Turn it the other way! Turn the mic... not yourself! Turn it the other way round. Isn't Natasha sexy? - This Natasha is some joke! - What!? Take a look. - You are right. - She seems to be an old hand. I think that this guy, Karan, deals in old scrap. Natasha! - Why is she calling out to herself? - Don't know. - Natasha! - What is it, Ms. Sweety? Why are you shouting? Natasha seems to be a man! What all did she change along with her name!? I am starting to doubt Karan. It is getting late for the shooting. Where is Natasha? Ms. Sweety, Natasha is in her room. Aunty. Sorry Aunty. I'm late. Only five more minutes. Okay? SWEETY: - Hurry up. - Is she Natasha? Yes... I am dead sure. Hi Golu. You know,today is a great day for me. Today is the shooting of my video album. Had you been with me, my joy would have been even greater. - I miss you. - We miss him too. Why are you crying? Why do you think that you are alone? I am always with you. Jayantilal and Tommy too are with you. Isn't it? - Come on fast. - Come on. Or we will be late for the shooting. - Hurry and sit in the car. - Start the car. Forgive me brother. - It's okay. - I was going... - Please forgive me. - It's okay. - It's okay. - Sorry. - Let me drop you. It's okay. - The road is here? - Please forgive me. I can't see at all. - It's absolutely okay. Come. Otherwise I'd not have bumped into you. - Let's go fast. - But brother, take this out. - Shall we? - Come on. - Ready? - Yeah. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Cut, cut, cut. What are you doing here? I'll go wherever Natasha goes. I'll also dance. Don't disturb the shooting. Later on, you can dance as much as you want. Let's go and sit there. Let's go. I'll be there in a moment. Shut up! Sorry, director. The fact is that he was run over... ...by Natasha's car and has become disabled. He even lost his memory and is living with us since then. Boss, he's disabled. He's just like her brother who passed away. Okay. What!? It's none of our business. He may be her distant relative. Trying to eavesdrop? SANJU: Natasha. Sanju! What a pleasant surprise! Wow... Natasha, you look gorgeous. SANJU: Today is the first video album of your career. - All the very best. - Thank you, Sanju. Natasha, I want to tell you something very important. - What's the matter? - Let's go over there. There. Come. Now, who's this? I don't know. I've to find out. Hold the mike properly. Why do you look so worried? Natasha, it is about that friend of yours. Raj Sinha... I learnt everything about him. He's not only a drunkard, but also a drug addict. What? Yes, he not only consumes but also peddles drugs. Oh, no. - Why can't I hear anything? - Shall I go close to them? - Why don't you rather give them the mic!? - Okay. - Just stay put. - So... shouldn't I go? Natasha, you must keep away from him... for my sake. Sanju, I can't believe it. Even I couldn't believe it initially. Raj is... Cannot believe, right? But... Take this. Read this paper. There's the police report in it. There. O my God! Thank you so much, Sanju. I wouldn't have known it, but for you. [PHONE RINGING] Madam, there's a call for you. - [PHONE RINGING] - It's his. Cut, cut, cut it. [PHONE RINGING] Hello Raj... ...I don't want to talk to you again. And I don't want to have anything to do with you. And from now onwards, if you try to meet me... Or if you try to call me... ...I'll complain against you to the police. Be strong! I'm with you. Madam, the shot is ready. Please come. Go now. Your shot is ready. I'll wait for you. And Natasha, be strong. Okay? Hello. Great! You wore a new kurta today. Nice! This is not a kurta. It's a coat. This is called a coat. Buddy, these are pants. These that you have on your hand are pants. Very nice! - This is a tie. - This is not a tie, it's a handkerchief. What a weird man you are! This... is a handkerchief. - But this is a vest. - A vest is worn inside a shirt! What one wears inside a shirt are called socks. Socks are worn inside shoes! What we wear inside shoes is called underwear. - Underwear! Look here... this is what is called underwear. - Show. Hey. Stop! It seems that your knee isn't working well. Go and get it treated by a plumber. - By a plumber? - Careful... or this blouse will get broken! MAN: Silence... silence please. Move back! Your kurta looks great! - Ready? Yeah. One, two, three, four. - You should make a saree. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. I have to get some more details about this girl. No boss, we should get more details about her. - What happened? - Nothing. SWEETY:Sometimes, I feel that it is my mistake. It's my fault. Had I forced you... ...you'd have been married by now. Aunty, what's the point in forcing someone? Shouldn't one find a worthy man for that? You saw many guys. What sort of guy do you want? Good looks and riches... these don't matter. But he should have a loving heart... ...and must do something creative. Like... an architect. And he should respect women too. Even after all these years Sweety couldn't find a good guy. But I am sure that you will find such a man very soon. Sorry. - What happened to your voice? - What happened? Why did you laugh like a man? Aunty, I'm sure that some day I'll get my dream boy. Now, we're in Tanya's city. Aren't you happy? Are you happy? No, Murugan. Till I see Tanya with my very own eyes... ...I can't be happy. No problem. Give me one hour. We'll go to Rocky and take Tanya's address from him... ...and from there we shall go to Tanya's house. Then you can see her and talk to her. As much as you wish. Happy? What's the problem? - Hi! - How are you, Rocky? Hello. Hi. Come... come. Welcome to Dubai. - Please have a seat. Sit down. - Okay. - Congratulations. He was right. - Thank you. He was right. His heart was always right. - She is in Dubai. - Yeah. How is she? Beautiful. Her face is very beautiful. Good. Very good... But... But? She's expanded in all directions. Expanded...!? Is she some kind of a blanket or what? She has become 132 km! 132 km? I mean, she now weighs 132 kg... she just sits all the time. Sits all the time!? Can't she walk? - How can a person walk on a wheelchair? - On a wheelchair? Isn't there any other chair in her house? Why a wheelchair? An accident is bound to happen when one drinks and drives. Accident!? And did Tanya start drinking alcohol? She normally never touched liquor. But when angry, she would gulp down a full bottle. And that day... ...she had a fight with her husband. Husband!? You mean... Tanya got married? Did I ever say that she is married? Did I? Actually, she is a widow. In fact, she is a double widow. Her first husband was very good. His only vice was smoking. One day he was smoking a cigarette and it blew up. Blew up!? He was at a petrol pump and it blew up. And the second husband? He was like God. He had no bad habits. But he was forgetful. One day, he got up from bed and took his bath. For his breakfast he had bread, jam, butter, cheese... But he forgot the most important thing. - Bread? - No, his breath. He forgot to breathe. Because he had acute breathing problem. [INDISTINCT] [SOBBING] Both the husbands passed away... ...but I've seen how much she loves her kids. Kids!? She has kids too? She has six healthy kids. Six kids? How can she have six kids in three years? Twins! A pair of twins each year. You are right. To raise them, she works very hard at night. Works at night? Yes, she started a laundry at her home. She set up 4-5 machines. She goes about on her wheelchair and washes all the clothes. Then she irons them. Don't ask what all things that Mother India doesn't do. She works hard for her seven kids. Seven? Just now, you said six kids. How to explain him? The seventh child is illegal. Illegal? It's from an underworld don's. - She married him too? - No. She didn't! One day she burnt his suit. The don forgave her. And then the affair started. Now both of you decide and tell me. When should I book the tickets to India? Okay... Let bygones be bygones. Get him married to a nice girl in India. Find a good bride for him. Where's your luggage? Aren't you coming to India? Who will make the payment? Defaulters are killed here. But, I'm not worried about the payment you owe me. - Your payment... - No. - Your payment... - Take your payment. Are you mad? I can't take money from a true lover. Hey God! I shall never commit such a sin. Okay, put it in here. Come on. We are already late. If we don't get a seat in the plane, we'll have to travel standing. No. I'll not go back. What!? You'll not go to India? However Tanya is in trouble right now. She needs me more than ever. And I can't leave her alone in this condition. I'll not go back. I bow to the greatness of your love. Oh God! You stay back. I swear you wait back. When you meet Tanya after 3 years, I'll cry a lot. After three years!? She went on her honeymoon last night. She went to honeymoon alone? Not alone. She went with that underwear. Underwear? Sorry, I mean the underworld don. She went away with him for three years. Such a long honeymoon! Three years! When the Interpol chases an underworld don... ...he needs to be on the run for at least three years. Three years! I won't stay here for three years. The three years will pass easily in five years. What is all this nonsense? Don't confuse us. We're not mad. Do we have oil wells here to stay on for three years? Who'll manage our business there? Karan, let's go. - Stop there! - Let go! Hold on. Go away! Go away if you have to. [AEROPLANE ENGINE REVVING] Good riddance! Can I have a look at your passport? Yes. - How many pieces of baggage? - Two. Okay. Two bags. - Your passport. - Thank you. Karan, Karan. Where is the security? Hey! Wait! Hey! Where are you going? What's it? Karan, will you go to India running? - The new van that came just now... - Yes. There's Tanya's poster on that van. What? - Tanya is in Dubai. - What? I found her, Murugan. I found her. That means Rocky took our money and cheated us! No. I saw that poster and... ...the name was Natasha instead of Tanya. That means Tanya changed her name. And we've asked Rocky to search for Tanya. That means whatever he said was about some other Tanya. Okay, but the van is gone. Where will we look for Tanya? I saw the music company's name. We'll get the address. That won't be difficult. No difficulty! No difficulty! Where's the luggage? The luggage has been put on the flight to India. Why don't you do some shopping with us too? What is this nonsense? Hi Sweetie. - Come on babes. Don't be shy. - I'll call the police. - I'll give you some good time. Come on. - Leave me... - Hello buddy! - Who is that? Hi. How far is the nearby hospital? Do you want to get admitted? No, I'm thinking of admitting you people. Excuse me, madam. Please hold this. Thank you. Come on boy... If it is far off, I will take you there and break your bones. Or do you want me to do it here? What do you say? Hey you! Stop! Stop! Stop! Harassing a girl! Scoundrels! How was it? Take this. This is your 100. Yours... and yours. You take 50. Why only 50? What was my mistake? They worked so hard. He broke the bonnet and he, the glass. He broke a bottle on his head. You didn't break even a mud pot. You are not fit for this. Sorry boss. I missed out this time. Teach him or I will have to bash you all up. Hit him! Are you okay? Just a minor scratch, but its okay. But are you okay? - Yeah, I'm absolutely okay. - Thank God. Are you an architect? How did you know that? I saw it... You must have seen me in Time magazine's cover story, last year. No, it is written on your bag. - Sharp eyes! - Thank you. By the way, I'm Rocky Hiranandani. Natasha Moolchandani. It is I who designed this global village. Really? Wow! I'm a gold medalist from Oxford Dictionary. Excuse me! Oxford university. What did you hear? I'm sorry, I heard dictionary. Dictionary. I'm really sorry. I earned a lot of money and now want to do something else. I want to help the disabled... ...mentally retarded and the blind. I want to help them. - Have you seen the movie 'Black'? - Yeah, it was very touching. Great! I financed it. Really? I gave all my white money in black. Oh! Come. I will drop you. What happened? Wow, Ferrari! Who Ferrari? Yes, this is my car, Ferrari. Please come. Lovely car. Isn't it lovely! Please, come. No thanks. I've my car. I'll go. By the way, I stay nearby. If you're free, let's have some coffee. Let's go. No. Not now. No, I meant 6 pm. How can we go now? This is my work hour. - Okay. - I can't come. [ENGINE REVVING] Someone is driving away your car... Driver, come soon after having lunch. - A driver? I will go in the coach. - Okay. What is your address? Bungalow no. 13, Jumera Beach. Okay, I should be there. - Okay, bye bye. Take care - Okay. - Bye. - Lovely soft hands. - Nice to meet you. Bye. - Bye. Thank you. [HUMMING] Got it? We are finished! It's Thursday today. What if it is Thursday? This is Dubai, man. It is a holiday on Thursday and Friday. We will know about Tanya when the shop opens on Saturday. We are in trouble. Murugan, this time I will trace Tanya at any cost. In these clothes? After two days you won't be able to recognize me. How can Tanya recognize you? Right buddy! Our luggage has gone to India. Let's do one thing. First of all, let's buy some clothes. - Let's go. - C'mon. These days there is no safety even in the parking lot. Aunty, I wonder what would have happened... ...if that guy hadn't come at the right time. Right, and by the way, how does he look? Good looking... handsome. Handsome! He must be using 'Fair and Lovely'. Shall I tell you one more thing? He is a famous architect. Architect? Whom are you talking about? They are talking about you! Am I an architect? You fool! It is about me. Even Raj pretended to be an architect, but he was a drug addict. Yes. Aunty, please... What 'please'? She said something sensible for the first time. Aunty... we shouldn't trust loafers like him. He isn't a loafer. Really! I have asked him to come here for coffee. Here!? It's fine. We'll get a chance to examine him. Jayantilal knows who is good and who isn't. If Jayantilal approves him, so have I. - You understood the situation? - Yes. No, you didn't. Now, we have to woo aunty. Aunty! Have you changed the target? How many people will you woo. To woo Natasha, we have to tackle her aunty first. And to do that, we have to persuade Jayantilal. Happy birthday to you! - Whose birthday? - Your birthday. - My birthday! It is not my birthday. - Weren't you born? How did you know that I was born? Because I too was born. And you were also born. That means we are brothers by birth. Take this. I brought flowers for you. Okay, put them on that tree and leave this place. I will give you gifts daily, after you become my brother-in-law. But I don't have a sister. You have two sisters inside. And you are lying to me, Jayantilal. Where is Jayantilal? So you forgot your name also? - What is your name? - Rocky. Is it okay with you if I call you Monkey, hockey or Tanky? Jayantilal! - Jayantilal! Is my tongue wagging? - No. - Do I have a tail? - No. - Did I ever bark at you? - No. Did you ever see me wetting the posts? Hold on! Not till now. Then, how can I be Jayantilal? Because your name is Jayantilal. So you really have the itch to meet Jayantilal. I will call him, right now. It will give you a awful bite... Jayantilal. Whom are you calling? My dog. What is your name? Tommy. My name is Tommy. Oh my God! Who are you and what do you want? Why do you come here always? Why do you meet me always? Because this house is mine. Now, leave this place. I am the future owner of this house. Now, you leave this place. I am the owner. Go away. Your sister Natasha invited me. You should go away. She might have called you to make you her brother. She makes every other man her brother. I am the main one and you are the 'other'. Get lost. Go away from here. Take a u-turn. I will make your hand take the u-turn. Tommy! Stop it! What are you doing? How much will you beat me? - No. No! - Tommy. Hi, Rocky. Hi! He is Rocky that I told you about. Since my childhood, I knew how to keep animals under control. And the people, back where I lived, used to call me TC. Ticket Checker? No, no. Trainer and Controller. Wow, that's great. By the way, she is Sweety, my aunty. What? Is she your aunty? I thought she is your sister? Thank you. You have maintained your physique very well. Thank you. By the way, are you married? No. I am a bachelor. Till now, I didn't find my kind of girl. Even she isn't married... Go and get him. Tommy, today we have to attend a program. Go and get ready. He takes time to get ready. If you are going somewhere, I shall take your leave. No, not now. In the evening. Today, we are launching Natasha. You are launching her? Where is she going? No, I mean we are going to Natasha's music launch party. You too come with us. What? Music! Are you a singer? - Yes. - I love singers. Would you like some tea or coffee? No. No tea or coffee for me. I am too health conscious. Really. Even Natasha doesn't like tea or coffee. Oh, that's very nice. What a coincidence! Very nice. Then... - But I drink juice. - I'll bring it in a moment. Tell me something about your family. - Bitter Gourd. - Bitter Gourd? Ask her to add Bitter Gourd in the juice. - Yes, sure. - Health conscious. Jayantilal... Scoundrel, get up! Jayanti... - Do you have Ginger? - Yes. Add that too in the juice. Jayantilal! Do you have spinach? Yes. Add that too in the juice. Jayantilal. Jayantilal. - Do you have Red pepper? - Yes. Add that also in the juice. It seems to be a very special juice. Jayantilal... How do I extinguish it? Okay girls, I am ready. And the juice is also ready. Why did you wrap Jayantilal in the blanket? He was feeling very cold. That's why I wrapped him... ...without your permission. I hope you don't mind. - How sweet! - So nice of you'll. Here is your juice. Juice! Don't give him juice. I will drink that juice. This juice is not for me. This is for Tommy. His hand will be restored if he drinks this juice. Natasha looks wonderful, isn't she? Thank you so much for coming. I am so glad. I can't tell you how well you sang. Excuse me. Excuse me. Congratulations! Madam, today your album is being launched. Your album is called 'Queen Of Dreams'. Can you tell us who the man of your dreams is? Right now, I am living in my dreams. Let me be there for some time. I will tell you when I wake up. Very smart. Very smart answer. Rocky, thank you so much for coming. A beautiful rose for a beautiful lady. Thank you. - Okay, I want to tell you something. - Yes. SANJU: Natasha. Sanju. Why is he here? - Sanju, I am so happy that you are here. - Thank you. - I will introduce you to someone. - Of course! Be careful. Meet him. He is Rocky Hirnandani. - He is India's no. 1 architect. - Hi. Are you also an architect? Who else is an architect over here? Actually Sanju is also an architect. I see. You too are an architect? Nice, very nice. When will the program start? From which university did you graduate? - That was in... - Oxford. Yes, Oxford university. Oxford! And what all buildings did you design? I built the Taj Mahal. You built the Taj Mahal!? But Shahjahan claims that he built the Taj Mahal. Hotel Taj Mahal in Mumbai. You built the hotel Taj Mahal in Mumbai? I didn't build the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai... ...but next to it is a building with a glass facade. - That means you also into... - What? - Into glass business? - No. Excuse me. That glass building was built by Oberoi builders. Absolutely right. Oberoi builders did build that. But I am the one who designed it. But I put a condition that my name should not be revealed. And what else have you built? And... Isn't it hot here? They are asking what else you built. The AC is full. Did you see the Red Fort? Red Fort, nonsense. If you have built the Red Fort, then I have built the Qutub Minar. Why are you getting angry? I was talking about Red Fort undergarments... So, you also have the business of undergarments? No. I built the factory for the owner of that company. And what else have you built? I built parking lots, parks, entrances... ...toilets, and the plaster on their walls. Should only I list my achievements or will someone... ...ask him about his work. You say something. Prithvi Apartments in Mumbai, I... This happens always. When two persons of the same field meet, they speak like that. Ladies and Gentleman! - May I have your attention please. - Look boy, look. Come... ...world Gold Council and D'damas Gold... ...presents you the most sensational music album... Queen Of Dreams. [CHEERING] Thank you. Natasha. And now we also like to present... ...collection G'gold jewellery to Natasha. [CHEERING] Are you happy, invalid? - Hi. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Let's now watch Natasha exclusively on zoom. Watch this Munna. Oh! Father, Tanya, Dubai. Hey, son of Subramaniam, why are you shouting? I brought this Idli and Dosa for you. And there are many more things that you have to bring. I searched a lot and found Tanya. Tanya is in Dubai. Dad, she is the girl that has the parrot. You will definitely get married. Let's go to Dubai. My son, can you recognize her... ...I mean my daughter-in-law? I can recognize Tanya even without looking at her. You fool! How can you recognize her without looking at her? Uncle, you don't know that his nose is like that of a dog. I can smell Tanya. Don't worry dad. She is in Dubai. How can she escape from us? Oh, you have a point. Let's move forward. [ENGINE REVVING] We were supposed to come at 6. Why did we come early? If we hear them in advance... ...we will get to know what the girl has in mind. Take out your baton quickly. That is not needed now. I fitted a microphone in her bracelet. What are you saying!? Do you think that Rocky is coming on a special purpose? I don't know. - Hey... - Quiet. Quiet... What will you say if he proposes to you? I don't know. But I know that. The aunty seems to be on our side. I shall have a temple made for her. Beggars are lining up even before the temple is built. What will he say after going in? Natasha, I came here to say something important. Important!? What is it? Stay away from Rocky. What? Why? What happened? He is a fraud. He is not an architect as he claims to be. Oh my God! What are you saying!? Yes, he is not an architect... ...or even a small time mason, for that matter. This rascal is butting in between. But he is invalid, isn't it? Why are you hitting me? Whom should I hit then? I have checked all Institutes for Architecture on the net. Rocky's name isn't in any of them. What are you doing? Why did he lie to me, then? If you don't believe me, I can give you the name... ...of that website from my dairy. Check yourself. Take. Don't be sympathetic to me because I am handicapped. Buck up. I'll get it. Where will it go? Yes. Come on. Come baby come. Check. I found out his address too. I will reveal the truth about him in a day or two. - Everything will be okay, boss. - This is cheating. I'll go and teach him a lesson just now. He is anyway going to come here at 6 pm. I cannot keep quiet that long. She is coming this way. Run! Hey, let's drive off! Hurry up! Quickly. Boss, she has come. Why did you tell her? Why do you want to ruin my home? Why do you want to ruin my home? Why are you beating me up? - Why did you tell my mother? - What? That I am not an architect. And that I am a captain in the Navy. You don't know that my mother hates water and the sea. - Why does she hate it? - Why does she hate it? I'll tell you that. What am I to say? My father was the Captain if the ship Samrat. My elder brother was its Vice Captain. When that ship sunk in the sea... ...both of them died. [SOBBING] My mother hates water from that day. She wouldn't even let me take a bath in my childhood. I used to bathe secretly at some neighbour's place. But alas... But my father's blood runs thick in me. And the sea beckoned me one fine day. But why did you tell my mother that I am not an architect... - ...and that I am a Captain in the Navy? - Calm down. You've made me an orphan. - Who will love this forlorn child now? - Calm down. Who will love me now? Tell me from where I should get love. Natasha, when did you come? Babloo, why didn't you tell me that she came? You are so naive! Natasha, I want to tell you that... You need not say anything. I heard it all. Rocky. You are not alone anymore from today. You are so sweet. You are very kind. You are the one from whom I'll get all my love. [HUMMING] Hello friends! The second part has begun. Karan's love is in danger. Tanya fell into Rocky's trap. Till now there was one love story, but now we have two. What will Karan do? Even those goons are getting anxious. They want the parrot. Sunny wants to marry Tanya and give Khurana a grandson. Some people want the girl and some want the code. This story is at a very interesting juncture. [GASPS] Rocky boasted a lot about himself... ...and made his way into Tanya's heart. He is very cunning... see now what he does. [HUMMING] [ENGINE REVVING] "The girl stole my heart." "The girl stole my heart and inflicted me with love." "Your gait is intoxicating. Your eyes are rosy." "Your gait is intoxicating, eyes rosy and form sweeter than honey." "The girl stole my heart and inflicted me with love." "The girl stole my heart." [ENGINE REVVING] - Monkey... - Thank you. - Hey, you... - Bloody monkey. Mummy! Mummy! No... don't! - Have you gone mad? - You idiot... You're biting me? Rocky, what are you doing? Have you gone mad? Go away. Natasha, while I was coming from there... ...he jumped on me and bit me like a mad dog. He is lying. I was giving him a hug. But why did you come here? I came here to give you a flower. He bit me saying that I shouldn't give you the flower. When did I bite you? You did bite me. - Did I bite him? - I didn't... And then he tried to strangle me. Thank God, you came just in time. Or else my neck would have become like my hand. I think you are quite comfortable there! He is talking rubbish. Rocky, you know his mental condition and still you... You should be ashamed of yourself. - Listen to me. - I don't want to hear anything. I... - Come on. - Natasha. - Let's go. - Please go. What perfume are you using? I also want the same perfume. You too use the same. Moron! He gave me the bone... ...and you took away the meat. I'll teach him a lesson. And what about the chicken dishes that you ate? - What chicken dishes? - This bill fell off from your pocket. 4 beers, 2 Chicken masala, 6 naans and other stuff. You advise me to observe a fast... ...but go and enjoy yourself! This must have come from that handicap's pocket. You mean he eats so much? Now, I have to find out who he really is! This bill is of... Drais Bar. Look there. Bloody... Give me the camera. Brother... From this side. That hand... Where are you running away? Natasha thinks that he is physically and mentally disabled. Now, I'll show Natasha who you really are. Show him the camera in which his dance pose is captured. No. What are you doing? This would be a big sin. What are you doing? Natasha would get hurt, if she knows about it. Our wedding is almost settled and I plan to invite you as well. - Almost, isn't it? - Is it almost settled? - Now, we shall give his full and final payment. - No! What are you doing? Why do you want to kill two persons? Two persons!? If Natasha learns the truth about me, do you know what she will do? She will definitely commit suicide. And who is the second one? And when she is gone from this world, you too will die. - Of what use will your life be? - No! Let go of me! How can I leave this traitor alone? I am talking about Natasha. Shut up and leave this place. From now onwards, do as I say in front of Natasha, or else... ...I'll make all parts of your body useless. - Mind it. - Okay. Learn to nod your head better. Remember it. [GASPS] I'm sorry. Did you get hurt? No... Thanks for the boat ride. No problem. I can do anything for you. Actually, sorry for that day. Tommy told me that he did bite you that day. Forget it. Now, we are very good friends. What do you say, Tommy? - Fool, liar, cheat... - Tommy! I used to have this opinion about you. And now? - Donkey, fool, idiot... - Tommy! I was that, because of my opinion about him. I agree. I agree. Now, what is your opinion about Rocky? To be honest there is no other scoundrel, crook... - ...and a swindler like Rocky. - What? I won't trust this statement, even if God were to say it. I was really scared. I know why he's talking like that. I know why he's praising me. [CHUCKLES] I'm really fed up of hearing him say... ...Rocky, I want to clean the boat. Okay, go and clean it in an hour. One hour!? - Okay, two hours, not more than that. - No! How innocent your sister is! Do it for four hours. Okay... four hours, but not more than four hours. Whose sister is she? If she's not your sister, is she your granny? And don't use this hand too much... ...don't use it because it is handicapped. And clean it properly. I'll just direct him, okay? Come with me. Don't come out of the boat for 5-6 hours. And when you will leave this place, thank me loudly. If you don't understand... I'll... No. no. I have kept all the necessary things here. Clean properly. Okay, enjoy yourself. Come. - Thank you. - Bye, Tommy. - Thank you. - Bye. Thank you... thank you. Eat something. Eat something. You're hurting your stomach along with your heart. Not till I find Tanya... - I won't eat. - Oh God! No need to be so sad... You'll definitely find Tanya. Tanya. Tanya. Oh God! - Just one straw! - Even we are one. Rocky is with Tanya? - Let me sip too. - Sorry. Betrayer! He wanted to send you back, so that he could get Tanya. - Let's go. - What rubbish? She's the one for whom we faced so many difficulties... And now, you want to leave her in trouble? Have a look over there! Come on Natasha. Since Tanya loves Rocky... For my happiness... ...how can I spoil her happiness? Come, let's go. Tanya! Karan! Karan, it's you! What a pleasant surprise! How come you are here? He came here searching for you. - Me? - Yes. Actually, we came here. And I thought that we could meet you as well. And we met... wow! How are you? - Just a moment. Rocky, please come here. - Yes. I'mm coming Natasha. Rocky, he is Karan, my dearest friend. - Hello. - Hi. And Karan, he is Rocky. He is a captain. Cricket captain? No. He is the Captain of a ship. - I thought that he is a football captain. - Funny. Anyways, how many days are you going to stay here? We are going back by the evening flight today. C'mon Karan. How can you go like that!? Today we are going to get married. - Today is our wedding? - Yes. Yes, today is our wedding. Yes, today we are going to get married! Today we are going to get married! Karan, stay back for today. You may leave tomorrow. No Tanya, I have to go back urgently. You fool! I was just joking. Joke? You poke fun quite often these days! Joke. Karan, you have become so smart and handsome... ...but still you haven't changed. Stay back now. We met after so many days. Let's do something. Let's spend the evening together. Yes, yes. Very good. I will get the ticket changed. - Don't worry. No difficulty. Thank you. - Murugan... Rocky, you too come with us. Thanks for remembering me. But, you two carry on... ...and enjoy yourselves. I have my boat for company. Rocky, don't speak like that. Today, we all will spend the evening together. [INDISTINCT] "We met at an age that love was bound to happen." "It's not our fault but that of our age." "O stranger, I'm your prince and you, my princess." "My youth searches for you. My youth is your devotee." "Our love story has started." "O dear, my adoration for you..." "...has become my life." "I want to tell this world that I can't live without you." "Who knows the extent of love that I have for you." "You are my life, O dear." "Yes, you are my life, O dear." "I need you, as much as I need to breathe." "I like you that much." "Your name is love, and mine is infatuation." "Your name is love, and mine is infatuation." "Your name is love, and mine is infatuation." "...my name is infatuation." "We are bound to be each other's." "We are bound to be each other's." "Your name is love, and mine is infatuation." "...my name is infatuation." "Why does the heart throb, and why does it suffer?" "Tell me, what has happened to my heart?" "Why does the heart throb, and why does it suffer?" "Tell me, what has happened to my heart?" "It laughs, it cries, and it dreams." "And it says, think about me for a moment." "My love is different from others." "I'm head over heels in love with you." "I'll come to take you away." "I'll come to take you away." "We met at an age that love was bound to happen." "It's not our fault but that of our age." [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] Come here. What happened, Sanju? What's the matter? Natasha, Rocky isn't an architect. Yes, I know, he's a navy captain. He's not even a captain. He's a murderer. - What? - Yes. Not just a murderer, but a serial killer. Like Raman Raghav. What!? You've committed murders, but didn't tell me. Even I came to know right now that I am a murderer. He trapped many girls in the web of his love... ...and then destroyed them. I won't let him escape. - Is Rocky a murderer? - Yes. I can't believe it. Don't you believe it? Don't you trust me? Then, read today's newspaper. A secret report of the Dubai police is published in it. Oh my God! Boss. Boss. Natasha, I'm your well wisher. Still, if you don't believe me, then... No. Sanju, you have always saved me in trouble. - Thank you so much. - Not at all. And listen to me carefully. Stay away from Rocky, for my sake. [INDISTINCT] Boss... I'll kick his... Boss. Oh God! Boss, he is not blind. You are blind... You should say that he is not lame! What's up, you limping scoundrel? Why do you stare at me like that? I'm a plumber. My name is Sanju Malvani. I'm the boss of all the plumbers over here. Shut up, you plumber... Don't forget that Natasha is mine. How come she is yours? - Listen... - What did you tell Natasha... ...that he is a murderer. One minute boss, let me talk. - One min... Is he a killer? One minute boss, let me talk. And where did you get that fake newspaper!? Why are you speechless now? - I will kick you... - Go away. Leave this place. Hey, you, it's enough, stop it. Did you beat him so hard... ...that he became all right and you became lame? How did his hand become all right? His hand and his brain, both are perfectly all right. He is a very cunning person. That means, you are not an architect and you aren't lame. - So, you were trying to cheat my innocent Natasha. - Hold it. You bloody... - Don't use your hands. Or else I will really... - How is Natasha yours? ...become handicapped. Don't use your hands. We are birds of the same feathers. Why fight? So much happened in Mumbai and you left without telling me? What would I say, Karan? That one moment changed it all. I had to change even my name. And I kept calling out to you with your old name. You may call me with that name. I like it. Thanks Tanya. What all I did to woo Natasha! You did not tell me that you did so many things. Shut up! I came here as a detective. A detective! And I came here as a defective. Defective! She used to come to the super market. And there used to be her mad brother, Golu. One day, I came to know that her brother passed away. I thought that she may have a soft corner for mad people. That's why I got under her car. I faked an accident, pretended to have become disabled... ...and that I lost my memory and entered her house. I went to Natasha's neighbor's house to fix a tap. I saw Natasha from there. I went crazy... ...and lost control over myself. But both of you spoiled my game. Not both of us, but a third one is going to spoil the game. From where did he come... out of the blue!? He is an old friend of hers. He is her college friend. Where are they? And what are they doing? Where they are what they are doing... ...only one person can tell us that. Who is he? This is the one!? [INDISTINCT CHATTER ON THE RADIO] Karan, after meeting you I feel as if I got back everything. After Golu passed away... I was completely alone. Why? You have three good friends. NATASHA: Yes, they are. Especially Tommy, loves me very much. Repeat, repeat Natasha! Please repeat. Hear it. He reminds me of Golu. God took away one brother... ...but gave me another. You should commit suicide now. And Sanju? Sanju! He is a darling to me. NATASHA: I don't know what would... ...have happened to me, but for him. He treats me like his own sister. NATASHA:And I too consider him my elder brother. Come. Let's commit suicide together. And the third one, Rocky. I haven't seen a person like Rocky. - Wow! - NATASHA:Smart, handsome, funny. Imposter! NATASHA: I never expected him to be a cheat. Hey! Anyway, forget them. Tell me about yourself. Do you still play the guitar? I played the last time when I was waiting for you. After that never. Won't you play it for me? Here? Not here, but at home. I have a guitar. You play the guitar for me... ...and I'll make coffee for you. Coffee with Karan! Before he plays the guitar, let's go and bash him up. Okay. [WHISTLING] - You're always in a hurry! You go in. - No! You go. Brother... Tell me what the idea is. We must deal with Karan first. What did he do? Just shut up. You are too much. There is only one option now. Murder... Don't you know that hanging is the penalty for murder in Dubai? Are you mad? Here the law is very strict, understood? Don't push me. There is some medicine in this biscuit. If a dog eats this biscuit it shall become a lion. And Karan will become its prey. Are we ready? - Come. - After the college... - Aunty, what are you doing? - Cleaning the house. It's half done. One minute, Karan. Something is wrong. Aunty, where is Jayantilal? He was being a nuisance. So I locked him in the bathroom. Oh no. - Karan. - Yes. - Please get Jayantilal out of the bathroom. - Okay. Excuse me, is Jayantilal her husband? No. He is our dog. Catch it. What breed is he? He's a pomeranian. I'm so scared. So it is you who was making so much noise. Hi, Jayanti. Hello. Come here. - [BARKS] - [SCREAMING] My dear Jayanti! My Jayanti! [BARKS] Stop it. [GROANING] My dear Jayantilal! - What did you do? - Water. "Baby I love you" "Baby I need you" "Close your eyes" "See me through" "Baby I love you" "Baby I need you" "Close your eyes" "See me through" "My beloved, test my love if you have to." "My heart is like a mirror, see yourself in my eyes." "See yourself..." "Baby I love you" "Baby I need you" "Close your eyes" "See me through" "I always thought of you every moment wherever I went." "If you leave me and go, that will mean the end of my life." "See what I've come to without you. Turn back and see me once." "See me..." "My heart is like a mirror, see yourself in my eyes." "See yourself..." "My beloved, test my love if you have to..." ...see yourself in my eyes". "Baby I love you" "Baby I need you" "Close you eyes" "See me through" "Baby I love you" "Baby I need you" "Close you eyes" "See me through" [ENGINE REVVING] Why do you think so much? If you just keep looking at the diamond ring... ...you will become old without getting your love. Murugan, I am proposing to someone for the first time. That's why I am feeling a bit nervous. Hi, Tanya. I want to say something very important to you today. Did you tell Rocky to follow me and to spy on me? Who told you this? I got an unsigned letter from someone. Is it true? Tanya, the truth is... Is it true or not, Karan? Yes. Get out. I don't want to see even your face. Tanya... I didn't know then that Rocky was... ...a rogue, a scoundrel and a murderer. Yes Tanya. So you asked such a man to spy on me... ...about whose nature you didn't know yourself. What did you tell to Rocky? To find out my bad habits and about my boyfriends? Did you want to find out whether I was fit for you or not? Karan. You lost my love even before you could get it. Did you think that you could frame me somehow... ...and get a place in my heart? Please get out, Karan. Go away from here. I wanted to search for you because... ...I never forgot you in the first place. If hadn't met you... ...my life would've been void. Hey... Rocky is the one who wrote the letter to Tanya. If I don't finish him today... ...I will have my moustache shaved off. But you doesn't have a moustache. I shall grow one and then shave it off. I'm not going to spare him. Murugan, return this rented car... ...and get tickets from the airport. I'll meet you there. Rocky... Who are you? What do you want? Rocky... What is it? Why do you shout like that? Contesting any election? Did you write that letter against me to Tanya? I didn't write even my name till now. How can I write a letter? Tommy is the one who wrote it. He is inside. Why do you tell lies like that? Will I hold a pen with this hand? Accusing me! I can't handle even the tissue paper in a toilet. - First lower your hand. - He may come to know. Lower your hand. Is his hand okay? Yes, he is neither disabled nor is mentally retarded. Now look there. Stand straight and don't toil so hard. He is the first lame person who isn't actually lame. This means that all of you are making a fool of Tanya. Who is Tanya? Is she good to look at? Give me her address. He is talking about Natasha. Her real name is Tanya. So Natasha too isn't real and is a phony character like us. Stop all this nonsense, stop it. Tell me who wrote that letter. Why do you get angry like that? I wrote that letter. It was also I who told lies about Raj, who was in love... ...with Natasha initially, and broke their relationship. Be thankful to me that I separated Raj from her. Otherwise the two would have been married... ...and you would have been left feeding biscuits to their children. Thank me for what I did. I don't believe this. Come to Natasha and tell her the truth. Yes, kill this lame man here itself. Let one story come to an end. Yes, finish off the hair shop here and now. He is too fond of combing it. You fool, what did you say about me? You handicapped insect! Insect? I'll hit you, don't mistake me. - Oh, you'll hit me? Go on. - Take this. Sorry... Red cap... sorry. Whom do you want? Where is Tanya? There in no one by that name here. Shut up! Oh my God! We have been searching for Tanya since three years. Three years now! And now you say that Tanya isn't here. Move on. "Where is the beauty?" Excuse me. You are mistaken. No, that is not true. Tanya and I studied together in college. Call Tanya. Tanya! What happened to you Tanya? - Veerappan! - No, I'm Sunny, the Romeo in our college. - Is it you, Sunny? - Yes, it's me. Embrace me just once, Tanya! But how did you get our address? You changed your name and address but your posters are everywhere. - Oh no! - Oh, yes. With the grace of Lord Guruvayurappa, I got Tanya, father. Keep quiet, you fool! Speak in Hindi. I've found the girl, I mean Tanya. I've found her. The marriage party is coming too. Come soon. Whom are you calling here? My brother, my father and my entire family is coming. Oh my God, but why? Today will be the marriage and tomorrow, the engagement. But I want to tell you before hand... ...that I am older than you. Shut up! Who is going to marry you? - I will pull your feet... - What!? I mean, I'll seek your blessings. No one will shoot without my permission. You!? Where is the parrot, dear girl? Dad, a grandson is born after marriage. Shut up, you idiot! I didn't come here to get you married. Oh my gosh! Deceit! Now, give me the parrot. Baby, where is the parrot? - What parrot are you talking about? - There is no parrot here. There is a dog. Want to see it? I'll kill you all without mercy. Tell me soon where the parrot is. Dad, she isn't going to confess this way. Hey, take her. No! Dad, don't touch her. Or I will shoot myself. My boy, it is loaded and will go off. Your childish pranks haven't stopped yet. Turn it your side, put the gun here and now pull it. Thank you. Dad, I'll count till three. You must vacate this place by then. 100, 99, 98... Idiot! If you shoot yourself... ...your dad will go ahead and marry Tanya. Correct! Dad, if anyone tries to move, I'll shoot him dead. Hey, are you out of your mind? Yes, I have become mad in love with Tanya. Run! Move aside! Leave me. What is happening? Stop him. - Aunty! - Hurry. Come on. Follow them! - Leave me. - Come on. No one should move. Run from here. - Where are you taking me? - Come on Tanya... Sorry. Excuse me, but I'm blind. - I'm not any better either. - Why are you pushing? Munna, come soon. If you try to move, I will grind you to paste. Hurry up! Move soon. Catch this. Sit inside. Where did they go? Give it to me. Open the door. Come on, escape from here! Oh, my god! Sanju! Hello... one minute... Hello! Yes, Ms. Sweety, tell me. Sanju! Sunny and his family came here... ...and kidnapped Natasha. - What!? Has Natasha been kidnapped? - What? Hello! Sanju, you are the one who always saved Natasha... ...from trouble. You only can save her now also. Let me listen. She's been kidnapped for the first time. Do something. Don't worry. I will set right everything. Please do that soon. Who kidnapped her? The family of some guy by the name Sunny. Sunny? Is he some Bobby's brother? Dharmendra's son?! One sec. Sunny is the son of a gangster. He was in college with Tanya. - Okay, let's go now. - Where? How can we go to her college now? I didn't even go to school. Hang on. Hang on. I think we should do something. What is this madness, Sunny? What are you doing? Tanya, it is the first time in the world that a bride... ...has joined the groom's procession before marriage. - Our marriage will be great. - Quiet! Stop the car, you scoundrel. It is important for me to catch her. Turn right. I love you a lot. Right from college. - What did you say? - I love you. [SINGING REGIONAL SONG] Help. Look at me, I'm there for you. Where are you taking me? Hey African brother, turn your head the other way. Hey, let go of the girl. Dad, first stop following me. Go further. Jump the signal. Move... come fast... Go! Brother, follow them. Had I been there, Tanya wouldn't have been kidnapped. Stop it! You could not save Jayantilal... ...and are making tall claims about saving Tanya. Jayantilal is not my beloved. Who is Jayantilal? It is that dog which fell unconscious. - A man like me is needed to rescue Tanya. - [PHONE RINGING] - Hello! - Hello! Murugan, tell me. One second, shut up guys! Yes Murugan tell me. Karan, Sunny is taking Tanya away at gun point. How did he get the cellphone network here? He's being followed by his father and brother too. Okay, keep following them. We are coming there too. - I am following him. - Let's go. Oh my God! I think Tanya's got kidnapped again. - Come with me if you want. I am going. - Oh God! - He's going, c'mon. - Take him along too. - He's done... He'll come later, let's go. - He's my assistant. Hurry up! - Hey lame guy, hurry up! - Hurry hurry! - What makes you so arrogant? - Why is this not opening? You have really become disabled due to acting. The keys are with me. Hey plumber, this isn't a tap for you to fit. What are you all doing? - Tanya is in trouble there, get in. - Let's go. I will sit in the front. I want to reach there quickly. - Where should I sit? - Sit under the car. Get inside. Lovers... Lovers... Lovers... - Hello, Murugan. Tell me where you are. - MURUGAN: Karan - Where am I? - Par Dubai. - We are going towards par Dubai. - Okay, we're coming there. Par Dubai. Should we cross Dubai? No, that's the name of a place here. - It is par Dubai. - I know it. I was just joking. You guys don't even let me have some fun. - He knows it. He also knows where Dubai is. - You know it? Please let me go. I'll let you go, Tanya. But after marriage. What are you ranting? We shall have cute kids. How great it will be! I want to experience the power of youth before I die. That girl has the parrot. - Hello, Karan. - What is it? We are going towards the Jumera beach. I took a right turn. Okay, keep following. Right turn at the Jumera beach. His right or my right? You fool! Right would be right... - ...for everyone. Isn't it? - Right, right. Hey plumber, this is a country with left hand drive. I'm asking you so that there should be no mistake. You intelligent fool! Stop the nonsense and drive straight. - My Natasha. - Tanya! - My Natasha. - Her name is Tanya. You call her Tanya but I'll call her Natasha. Just sit quiet. Go faster. [PHONE RINGING] Quiet now. The phone is ringing. - Whose call is it? - It is from Murugan. I took a left turn at McDonald's. Left, left. - Left from where? - At McDonald's. Left from McDonald's. We can't find McDonald's. Ask him if pizza Hut will do. I found it. There is his vehicle. There they are! C'mon let's catch up. Drive faster, Rocky. Should I drive faster and go in front of them? We should follow them, isn't it? What's the point in going fast? Lovers... Lovers... Lovers have gone crazy. Drive faster. This girl should not escape from me today. Lovers have gone crazy. Lovers have gone crazy. - What happened? Bad luck, run away. - Where have you brought me? Run Tanya run. Tanya, these people are the enemies of love. Don't be afraid. Dad! Don't run in the sand. Hand the girl over to me. If anyone tries to move, I will crush their bones. Sunny, let go of the girl or else! I will let go of the gun but not the girl. Are you father and son not ashamed of yourselves? All of you are troubling an innocent girl. She belongs to someone else. Please understand this. We will tell you. Our uncle is a scientist. He discovered a formula that restores youth. And he put the code for that formula in a parrot. [CHUCKLES] That parrot is with this girl. I've been crying hoarse that I don't know about that parrot. One second! That parrot is with me. Is the parrot with you? Is it with you? Do you have that parrot? No, it's not with me. I mean... it was with me. Why do you change your stand like a dancer? I'll explain to you. I gave the parrot to Rocky. - Who is Rocky? - It's me. Don't shout. - When did you give me the parrot? - Didn't I give you a gift? Why would you give me a gift? Didn't I give you a box and ask you to give it to Tanya? Oh, that idiotic box! Is there a parrot in it? And he is crying to get it! Let me see if it's there or flew away. Hey, get it quickly. I can't bear this old age any longer. My wife is waiting at home. Karan, here is your gift to Tanya. Give me that parrot. Give me that parrot. Get lost old man! I sold this for millions. Catch him. Hey! Son, I'm your real father. You girl, you saw me commit the murder. Didn't you? No! Now get ready to die. Tanya. You bastard, let Natasha go or I will break your bones. Get lost, you lame man. No, don't hurt Tanya. C'mon Sunny. Oh God! Don't shoot. What is all this that I'm seeing? I'm fortunate to be blind. Hey, open the box and check it first. Brother, your parrot is here. Hey, give me the parrot or I'll kill the girl. Have you come to attend a marriage? Leave the girl first and then I'll give you the parrot. Go... You go... - You always interfere in everything. - Go on man. My son, give it here. Here. Hey, what are you doing? I've lost my youth for nothing. What have you done? Catch your parrot! The code number is now in her brain. Kill her if you can. If not the girl, I can surely kill you. Stop there. Drop your gun. C'mon now. Tell me who is going to kill whom. Why do you laugh? - Will you shoot me? - Why? If you have the guts count three before shooting me. If this is your last wish, so be it. One, two... - Where did you shoot from? - See there. Did you bring an ant to kill me? [ENGINE REVVING] Hey, leave it. Tanya. Tanya. Tanya. Natasha, are you okay? But how did you get well? Why? Yes, by the grace of God I recovered fully. Natasha, this happened only due to the power of your love. I understand everything. I don't want to see you at all. Natasha! Hey wait. You... - What is the code? - I won't tell you. - Hey, why are you talking with her like that? - Who are you? Am I not there? Tommy, you are a liar. Your hand is all right. - It is all because of my love for you. - What? If that lame guy can get back both his legs... ...can't I regain a single hand due to your love? - Go away from here. - Natasha! - Did you see Tanya? - She went that side. Go there. Thank you. [GROANING] Here. One second. What are you doing here? - Taking care of you. - What? C'mon now, you black crow. You are fine, aren't you? You aren't blind. You can see everything. Who says so? Can you see this maroon car? - Yes, I do. - But I can't see it. Can you see this off-white car too? - Yes. - But I can't. And I can't see the symbol of that taxi either. Liar, cheat! All of you are thieves. Throw this. - Oh dear! - Tanya. Did you see Tanya? Hey man with the big moustache and long hair... ...I am a blind man and can't see anything. Correct. [ENGINE REVVING] Come on turn. Get inside. Leave me... give your helmet... take this. Rocky! Shoot him. Run! Run! Tanya, come here. Let's go. Tanya you go. I will handle. Go. Go, Tanya. Go. Hey, come on. No. Let me go. No. [TYRE SCREECH] C'mon, faster. Take brother's car to safety. MURUGAN: Stop the car. - Tanya. - Tanya. - Tanya. - Tanya. - Tanya. - Natasha. Hurry up Tanya. - Tanya. - Natasha. - Tanya we have to go to Kerala. - Hurry up! - Natasha. - Tanya don't worry. [INDISTINCT] [INDISTINCT] [INDISTINCT] [INDISTINCT] Tanya listen to me. You guys all shut up! [INDISTINCT] Please stop. Leave me alone. Why don't you understand? [INDISTINCT] [INDISTINCT] All of you deceived me. You traitors! No words can describe your villainy. Nonsense! You cheated my innocent little Natasha. I will not forgive you in my life. I will eliminate you. Tanya, I am your old lover. It is true. All the others are useless. You are not just useless but are just a kid. Do you think that you have become great... ...just by growing a moustache like a donkey's tail? What a statement!? You reduced the pride of my boy's moustache to nothing. Actually the donkey's tail lost its pride due to the comparison. - Okay then. - Shut up. You fraud... Believe me. I took his help to get your love. Don't believe the words of these cheats. - Quiet! - You are the greatest traitor of all. Shut up deceiver! You've enjoyed yourself and are now resorting to deceit. By acting like one without a hand, you broke her heart. For the sake of my love... For the sake of my love I slept under the car. It is not easy to act like a handicap. I had to remain like that all through the day. - Do that for five minutes and show me. - Quiet! Shut up! What about the hospitality you enjoyed? You ate and drank for free too. Don't know what else he used to do. What do you say about that? Keep quiet, you lowly thief! Didn't this plumber act as if he is an architect? Everything is fair in love and war, okay. No, everything is war when love has failed! Stop this nonsense. First get him to speak proper English. Natasha, tell me the truth. Was I unfair to you? I just disguised my true identity. But these scoundrels made a fool of you. They toyed with your emotions. How did all this happen? I promise you. That I will stand by you in good times. I promise. - Please give your hand. - Hey! I too am here with my eyes closed. I loved her with my eyes closed. Because love is blind. Don't make fun of love with your blind act. I am the emperor. I declare... ...that everyone is out. This man is the right choice. - Is it okay? - Shut up, you vampire. - I'm the right man. - I'm the correct one. - I'm the correct one. - Shut up, you can't be correct. - Me! - Me! - It's me. - I'm perfect. Quiet! Just shut up. All of you are equal partners in this game of deceit! [INDISTINCT] [INDISTINCT] [INDISTINCT] [INDISTINCT] Shut up! Stop this nonsense. Tanya! Now no one will speak. Only Karan will speak. Any difficulty? Speak on, Karan. None of these is suitable for you. I know who is best for you. Please come in. Who is this new entry? - Raj! - Yes, it's me. Karan told me everything. I lost all hopes. He brought me here to you. Raj is a very good guy, Tanya. He's not a fraud. It was Sanju who created differences between you both. And saw to it that your engagement is broken. Sanju, is this true? Yes, Natasha. It is true. You people have hurt my Natasha. I don't know how I should punish you all. We already got our punishment, aunty. By losing Tanya's love. What can be a greater punishment than this? Wish you all the best. Thanks. Hi Natasha. Now see this! Never ever fall in love again. Forget it. Karan! Karan! - Karan! - Yes. Karan! You seem to be forgetting something. What? That without which you cannot go from here. Take this, your car key. Okay Karan... there is a problem. Raj is going to America next month. Raj wants the marriage to be done this month. - What is the problem? - Is it fine with you? Why would I have a problem with that? When I am going to marry a person... ...is his consent not needed for the marriage? Not this time, Tanya. No jokes this time. Stupid. I am telling you the truth. Really? Really. But, Raj? Our story ended even before it could start. But if a person loves me so much... ...that he can sacrifice his love for my happiness... ...only such a person has a right over my heart. I love you too, Karan. I love you. Karan. All the best. Wonderful. Marvelous. Mind blowing. What a dramatic change in the scene! Catch this... No difficulty at all. A grape in a monkey's mouth! Tanya! What shall I do now? Dear man, go for shopping now... ...and book your place for the next life. Why didn't I become blind before seeing this? Had you not interfered, Tanya would have become mine. And you all would have been giving me the farewell. You sinners! Keep quiet. See how affectionately she is embracing him! How they longed for each other! At last the guy who got the girl, is the one whom she wanted too. - Wow! - Amazing! - What did you say? - What are you saying? - What are you saying? - What else should I say? When the girl is lost, what else can be said? Smart. Just find out where she is going for honeymoon. Yes, boss. [HUMMING] "Our story has come to an end." "The king got his queen." "They came to each other after a long struggle." "This is the victory of true love." But sit on. Don't leave just as yet. There is something more I have to tell you. Won't you ask me what happened to Khurana? Whether he remained old or regained his youth? The don became so mad at getting the formula... ...that he forgot the most important thing about it. Instead of taking a drop, he consumed the whole bottle. The father became a son. And the son became a father. Isn't this funny? Isn't the charm of 'Deewane Hue Pagal' wonderful? Good bye... Sat Sri Akal. Namaste... Salaam... I'll take your leave, now that my job is over. You must have enjoyed and laughed a lot... ...and now you will leave this place a happy lot. But don't forget this friendly story teller.
