BRIAN: Now, when people think of New Jersey, they think of North Jersey. The highways, the cities, the oil refineries. You know, Springsteen, The Sopranos. That's North Jersey. But you have South Jersey, which is basically a different State. But it's one huge Pine forest. DR. BRIAN: If you get into certain parts of it at night, I mean, it is pitch black. You don't hear highway sounds, you don't see anything. So that too has got a kind of... romantic, otherworldly feeling to it, that maybe there are creatures out here. Maybe there are monsters out here. Well, the Pine Barrens really is a peculiar place. And although New Jersey is the most densely populated State in the union, the Pine Barrens remains very, very sparsely populated part of the State. DR. ELEANOR: I think that it's considered a no man's land because of the vast expanse of forest in an otherwise heavily human dense area. We typically think of the Northeastern seaboard as a really dense space for human population. It's not like the Southeast, or really the central area of the United States, where communities are really spread out. So, to have such a wide expanse of space that's more or less human unoccupied, it can kind of gain this life of its own, or this community understanding that it's not a safe place, that it's not a place where humans are welcome. Where it really belongs to nature or the unexplored or the unknown. There's some really amazing folklore books about the Pine Barrens because it has a really fascinating representation in popular culture as an incredibly haunted place, for good reason, in that when industry moved out of that region the forest overgrew and overtook a lot of the industry buildings that were constructed to support the steel production in that area. The Pine Barrens. I grew up in the Hudson Valley of New York, and so I was going around and looking for, you know, ghosts and those sort of things there. As I got older and got a driver's license I started expanding my horizons. And, oddly enough, in the early 80s, the Meadowlands area of New Jersey, sort of became a place where if you didn't want to go into New York City for a concert or for a hockey event, you could go to New Jersey. And so I started doing that and then found that the hockey team was the New Jersey Devils that were named after the Leeds Devil and I was blown away by that. I'm like, wait a second, what's the story there? And they started saying, "Well, yeah, if you go out to the Pine Barrens, that's where this thing lives." And I thought, okay, well, why hasn't anybody found it yet? And thinking that the Pine Barrens was going to be just a little stretch of woods, a couple of acres or something like that, and then went into the Pine Barrens, and it was like going into another world. I think a devil could live back in here if there was something, as well as all other sorts of monsters. I mean, you could go forever back there and not find any other people. There's really no other legend like the legend of the Jersey Devil. And, you know, it's a unique legend in a unique geographical location. I think the Jersey Devil is kind of a really good emblem, to kind of represent how interesting and unique the Pine Barrens is. The creature itself is kind of horsey, sort of like a deer with wings. But a lot of people have actually claimed that what they are seeing is a creature about the size of a Collie or a German Shepherd that has a head more like a horse. It has horns. Head of a horse. It's got a head of a... I've seen a head of a dog, I saw a head of an ostrich, I mean and cloven hooves. DR. ELEANOR: And it's got typically bright red eyes, some kind of goat-like features, and most importantly, it's winged. A thin body. Either hooves or claws, depending on the version of the story that you're hearing. JAMES: So the wings have carried through. But this... Does it have horse feet? Does it have hooves or the cloven hooves? That all seems to go away, and it's more of a giant winged cryptid. Imagine Pegasus at the wrong end of a really bad meth addiction. That's what the Jersey Devils looks like. Descriptions of the Jersey Devil, match with the popular concept of what the devil would look like if you were to encounter him. Even though the Bible gives a slightly different answer to that question. [SCREECHING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: [ON RADIO] Now, look, all I'm saying is these weird sightings taking place in the Barrens could really just be some pineys with overactive imaginations. We're talking about people claiming the kids are performing rituals in the woods now. And they're raising the devil. Really? This is where we're at, really? Supposedly, this demon is some sort of flying horse with wings, and they're finding tracks in the snow, tracks in the sand. And park rangers are running into this thing and on and on. Pineys, man. We are in the middle of this hysteria over people performing rituals by playing Dungeons & Dragons or listening to hair metal. Well, listen, if this thing is a demon summoned by hair metal, sign me up for a look at it. [RADIO CLICKS OFF] [PHONE RINGING] Ranger station. Hello, Miss Stockwell.

[SHRIEKS] Well, in about 1982 is when National Hockey League team had moved to the New Jersey area and was seeking names for the club. The franchise had a contest, actually. Over 10,000 fans evidently wrote in to give their suggestions. And one of them... The one that won was New Jersey Devils. And that was a deliberate callback to the Jersey Devil legend. So that, as far as I know, it's the only major league team in any sport that features a cryptid as its mascot. It really is a reference to the Leeds' story. Yeah, I think you'd be saying, like the early 80s was when it kicked in from the... [CHANTING SATANIC VERSE] DR. ELEANOR:The Satanic panic. Fascinating period in our history that was really kicked off in the 1980s, where good, God-fearing Americans began to go almost on witch hunts to strike out and find those in their own community, who were practicing anything related to Satan. This included any type of occultist beliefs in, you know, witches or spirituality or crystals, sageing, incense. In fact, I've seen people discuss the likelihood that trips into the Pine Barrens will result in finding places where satanic sacrifices have occurred, or where occultists are doing all sorts of sacrifices and that's used as reasoning for why people should not enter the Pine Barrens, is because it's this place for satanic practice. A possible link between the 80s, the Satanic panic, and then the Jersey Devil or Leeds Devil, I would get backlash when I would tell people I'm going to go look for the Jersey Devil. And it was, "What are you looking for the devil for?" But there certainly was, for me, the backlash being like, "What, are you playing your records backwards, too?" And doing all that sort of stuff. This is heightened when we think of the role of the Jersey Devil and the stories of the Jersey Devil's origin as, you know, either son of Satan or in bonds with Satan or offspring of Satan, whatever it might be, that sightings of this creature known as the Jersey Devil are reaching this new height, this new purported wave. Because it ties into that overarching fear that's gripping our nation. I remember there was some kind of a wave of sightings in the 80s. And isn't that the one where the police put up signs saying the Jersey devil is a hoax? The sightings, it seems to come in like little waves, and it's sporadic. I don't know how to account for that. I think, obviously, if somebody claims that they saw the Jersey Devil, it could trigger copycat claims. JAMES: There are a lot of newspaper reports into the 80s, and several of them make reference to the Pineys, the people who lived out there, saying that the Leeds Devil was sort of like the boogeyman, that don't go out at night or stay home or... There are some reports where they're actually saying it was almost like [CHUCKLES] the Leeds Devil was like Santa Claus, that they knew what you were doing. And if you did anything bad, the devil was coming for you. Which, again, I think is sort of interesting when you look at and just say, take the Leeds part out of that and, hey, you do anything bad, 'the' devil is coming for you. I could see how some of that got transposed with each other. Typically, the sighting is of a winged creature, you know, either from the ground taking off and flying, or being seen flying through the woods themselves. DR. ELEANOR: According to the Asbury Park Press of October 1988, a man who lived in Howell Township encountered the devil in 1981. He described the creature as having a furry body, huge feet with three toes on each one, large teeth and he stood about six feet tall. I know a hunter, a friend of mine who's a hunter said he got up early one morning to go deer hunting, and he got in his stand and he kept hearing some really strange, loud noises. And then in the opening in the woods that was adjacent to his hunting stand, he saw a strange creature, that was moving along in the early morning. Just barely light, you know? It was making such a loud noises -and he couldn't account for what kind of animal it was. -[SCREECHING] And he said he got out of the stand and went back to his truck and went home. MARK: There were... I would say there's a steady stream of sightings. Yeah, I mean, in the 1980s, there are some very 80s-style sightings. I mean, there was one in which there were a group of dirt bikers who were riding around in the Pine Barrens. "In the late 1980s, a couple of my friends and I took a camping trip to the Pine Barrens. I was unaware that we were headed to the home of the Jersey devil. We headed out on our bikes and did our fair share of partying that night. The next day, while everyone was asleep, three of us decided to hit the trails a bit earlier than usual. We were about 100 yards away in the woods when my bike stalled out. I looked and found that my friends had stalled also. At first, I thought it had something to do with the terrain or maybe something to do with the nearby power plants. Fifty feet away from each other, we tried to start up our bikes when suddenly, from the woods, we heard the most horrible, piercing scream. -[DISTANT SCREECH] -It sounded inhuman. Like something being tortured. Once back at camp, they asked us if we had heard screams earlier. They had heard them, too, about four miles away. That night, we headed into the local town because we ran out of booze. We went into a bar and I ordered a drink still in shock from what I heard that morning. The bartender asked, 'Hey, kid, what'd you see a ghost or something?' After I told him the story, he smiled and said, 'Looks like you met our little friend.' He then asked us to come out back. He showed us a tin garbage can that was shredded to bits. It looked like the shreds were made from something with three claws. I've never returned to the Pine Barrens since, and I don't plan to go back." But also in the 1980s, there was very strange thing that was reported. I think that was 1980, to be precise, where there was some sort of State game warden or someone, park ranger, perhaps, that found, had a farm, a group of pigs that had been eaten like from the top of their heads had been gnawed off, but there were no tracks around any of the poor animals that had met that end. So the question... Even though there's no eyewitness report of a creature that was still raising questions about that particular part of the State. JAMES: There were once State parks kind of came in to play. In general, you get a lot of these generalizations about park ranger saw this or... Not just with the Leeds Devil, but in general. I think some people will pull that in because you now have a credible witness. You have a park ranger that's going out there and they would know the areas so they would know what's going on. So, I think some of the urban legends, if you will, pull in park rangers in general. That being said, it would stand to reason that people who have the most chance of encountering the Leeds Devil or the Jersey Devil would be park rangers or people that lived out there because they spend the most time out there, so. By the 1980s, I think there was a general sense that there was a cryptid afoot in the Pine Barrens. I think the public consciousness at that point was already had taken pretty good form. And there would be things that would come a little bit later like Blair Witch Project, for example, that drew even more attention to that region of the country. [EERIE PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [MOUTHING] [PLEASANT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [MOUTHING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR OPENS AND CREAKS] [WIND HOWLING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [ROOF CREAKING] [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [SCREECHING AND GROWLING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREECHING] [COCKS GUN] [SAM SCREAMS] [WINGS FLAPPING] [SHRIEKS] [CREATURE SHRIEKS] [GUN FIRING] [SORROWFUL PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] So, in 1909, it is the turn of the century. Right? A lot is happening. We're ramping up to World War I, there is a lot of social change, there's a lot of economic change, and there's a ton of industrial change. All of that is kind of circulating the air. Interestingly, in January that year between 16th and 23rd, we see a rash of newspaper publications that indicate an intense series of sightings of the Jersey Devil. Some reporters go poking around, and they speak to some people living there, especially the Pine Barrens. And a few older people say, "Well, you know, when I was a little kid, my grandpa talked about the Leeds Devil. Maybe it's the Leeds Devil who is doing... leaving these footprints and, you know, stealing stuff out of people's barns and chasing away their goats and whatever." And so slowly that idea starts to build. Well, I think the hardest story to explain is the story of the multiple sightings of the Jersey Devil in January, 1909, There were policemen who fired their pistols at the thing. There were, you know, people who reported face to face encounters with it. People really were terrified. The newspapers picked up the stories. Well, in the 1909, sighting flap of the Jersey devil, I think what characterized that more than anything else was the tracks that were found all throughout the Pine Barrens and the surrounding towns. DR. ELEANOR: So, on the 16th of January, which was a Saturday, the creature was seen flying over Woodbury, New Jersey. On the 17th in Bristol, Pennsylvania, this is where several people saw the creature in the tracks that it created. On Monday the 18th, the town of Burlington was covered in strange tracks, which seemed to defy logic. And then some of these same tracks were found in other towns. MARK: Long track lines that look like hoof prints in the snow. Those were seen all throughout the area, even going up onto people's roofs and ascending and descending and appearing and disappearing, and that was sort of the main feature of all of those. DR. ELEANOR: Two Gloucester hunters also tracked the creature's perplexing trail for about 20 or so miles. The trail, interestingly, appeared to jump fences and squeeze under eight-inch gaps. So, not only did it have an insane vertical leap but also could shrink extremely small. Newspapers even produced maps showing all of the different locations where people had claimed to have seen this thing. They followed tracks in the snow to see if they could track the thing down and kill it, you know. Formed posses and they tried to track it down. What kind of tracks they were actually following? I don't know. [LOW GROWL] When you look at the published reports, that's when you start to think these are a little weird. Because the Leeds Devil was accused of everything from attacking livestock to attacking people. In some versions, people said that it was more like a dragon and it was breathing fire and that it was setting like rail road tracks on fire. The one that I've always been fascinated with and could never find anything, except it was printed in two newspaper reports, is that police officer was making the rounds, and he thought, he described it as a giant closed umbrella leaning against a fence post, and he went over to sort of pull it down or what have you, and it opened up and spread its wings. And he started wrestling [CHUCKLES] with this thing, supposedly. And then it just took off. And I think that's one of the closest encounters, if that really was the Leeds Devil, that I've found so far. So I've always been fascinated with that one. DR. ELEANOR: And many towns at this point were panic stricken. News had broken out all across the area, and they knew that stuff was crazy. Many businesses were closed and schools were also closed or they were forced to close due to lack of attendance. JAMES: They were still seeing it in the Pine Barrens area. But it pushed up into New York and then specifically, it made its way into Philadelphia. So we're not talking any more about these sort of isolated reports of, you know, the pineys that are seeing something weird. You're getting into like Philadelphia. So you're talking about densely populated areas that the creature was roaming around. And that, again, is what's so fascinating about the 1909 sightings. DR. ELEANOR: The creature apparently was not fazed as it continued to rampage through Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and West Collingswood, New Jersey, where it was supposedly hosed by the local fire department. The devil seemed poised to attack nearby people who defensively threw any available objects at it. The creature would suddenly fly away, and it would reemerge later only to injure a dog, ripping a chunk of flesh from its cheek before the owner drove it away. -[RIPPING SOUNDS] -[DOG YELPS] JAMES: The idea of it being seen, any cryptid, being seen in a densely populated major city is, it's unheard of. You know, it's very unique because most of any cryptid sightings and the vast majority of the Leeds Devil story, then Jersey Devil stories are in remote areas that you've got one or two witnesses, or if it's over a series of days. Maybe you've got a handful of witnesses. We're talking hundreds of witnesses allegedly taking place in a major city. At this time, the primary way that people would receive news was from the morning and evening paper that would be published by local printing presses as well as a few regional papers. And many communities would have several newspapers, so people were always vying for the best report, the best headlines because they wanted their papers to sell above everybody else's. And, if you had the most popular newspaper, you were afforded a very special and particular type of esteem in your community. I have heard before that there is thought that this story or series of stories was concocted in order to sell newspapers because this area saw the opportunity and as one paper started to do really well, the next paper would make up another story and it would only grow and grow and grow and grow and grow. It's really been alleged that a lot of the 1909 sightings, the track finds were one thing, but the sightings may have been planted in the media by those who were looking to sell tickets to their Dime Museum in Philadelphia. DR. BRIAN: There is a place in Philadelphia which, unfortunately, is no longer there, called the 9th & Arch Street Dime Museum. It's a parking lot now, in downtown, Philadelphia. And Dime Museums were really popular in the late 19th, early 20th centuries. They were basically circus side shows and you know you'd have the two-headed babies in a jar, you'd have the skinny man and the fat lady, and you'd have jugglers and all that. All that sort of carnival stuff that we think of. All in this one place. But the 9th & Arch Street in Philadelphia is slowly beginning to fall on hard times. Because just like today, you can shock people, but after a while the shock wears off and now you want a new shock. And so they're running out of shocks. They're trying to figure, "What do we do? How do we get people to start coming back to this?" And they see the newspaper reports about these strange goings on in the woods, and as soon as they see that they think, "Jackpot!" That will bring people in. What they ended up doing was not only planting stories it's alleged in the local media newspapers, but staging Jersey Devil Hunt, going out and claiming to find something and bringing it back to the Arch and 9th Street Museum in Philadelphia, where it could be viewed for a modest fee. And so now they start advertising "We've captured the Jersey Devil." "Come see the Jersey Devil." And the lines are now around the corner. So the way they had it set up in a big room, darkened room. Cage on the stage. You can't see what's in it. They bring a bunch of people in and there's a barker there, you know, "Jersey Devil eats people." "Peek. Don't get too close. Because you don't want to." And they pull the curtain off. And here's this thing. [FABRIC FLAPS] [GROWLS] And what people saw when they went into the museum, in a cage, was a kangaroo that had been fitted with some sort of contraption that made it look like it had wings and painted in shades or stripes of green. This creature, this poor kangaroo, evidently, there was some sort of sharp object that it was poked with and make a lot of aloud sound that would alarm the patrons who had gone there to see it. And so, word gets out, you know it's not real, and so that's the end of it. After this, people asked them, "Why did you fake this?" "We're a Dime Museum. That's what we do. We fake stuff. Why did you believe us when we told you we had this thing?" And so after a while, you know, it all dies down. But why that's all important is because now this name Jersey Devil has gotten into the bloodstream and people start coming out of the woodwork saying, "I know it's real. I've seen it." There's this thought that this story or series of stories was concocted in order to sell newspapers. Because this area saw the opportunity and as one paper started to do really well, the next paper would make up another story and it would only grow and grow and grow and grow and grow. However, in other cryptid sightings that have been primarily spread by newspaper reports, There's less of a vested interest in that type of one-upsmanship hoax culture that would persist for one week and then completely disappear. What we normally see is that one paper will publish a story and then the next will offer rewards or potential scoops or will maybe publish a photo. But there's not typically this addition of a more complex narrative that would quote people directly or that would involve the local fire department, for instance, that would be less likely to be seen in that area or that time period. It's been alleged, you know that the 1909 sightings and the reports in the media essentially launched the Jersey Devil as we know it today, and that would be very convenient. But what is so interesting is that it's simply a matter of record that in 1859, which of course predates 1909, Atlantic Monthly ran a lengthy story about a man who went to the Pine Barrens and interviewed locals, some of whom told him the legend of the Jersey Devil. And not only that, but talking about the fact that some strange creature had been seen in that area ever since. And that occasionally in the Pine Barrens, there's something flying about or messing with people's livestock. So that is the fly in the ointment, as far as saying that there is a neat tie to 1909, which explains it all. It simply doesn't. There are tribal beliefs associated with that area, particularly in terms of the landscape. So, one of the ways that tribal communities preserve their stories is by having the place name of a physical place tied directly to a story. In the Pine Barrens, the Lenape tribes knew the area as 'Poppuessing', which meant 'The place of the dragon'. When Swedish settlers then came into the area, they adopted a form of that name and also knew it as the place of the dragon. For these tribal groups, it was more about the structure of the place. So the land and the interaction between the forests and the water created spaces or inlets that were reminiscent of native tribal stories that included those patterns like dragons or other type of monstrous creatures. And so that land became known as that as the result of those. Not inherently, because there was a dragon that was sighted there by those native folk. There is good reason to believe that the legend traces all the way back to the Native Americans in this area. The Native Americans, in this area believed that there was a spirit being that lived in the wilderness, and they had a ceremony that they performed for this spirit. MARK: The Lenape tribe had a whole variety of folkloric figures that they were able to describe to the Europeans when they arrived. The one that corresponds to the Jersey Devil most closely was a deity figure called Mising. And Mising is the one that had the head and body of the deer. A male deer with antlers and bat-like wings, and was seen as sort of a protector of the forest. As the European settlers come in, and most of them with a very strong religious perspective, there would be a crossover that would take place between native legends and beliefs in folklore and beliefs that were often rooted in biblical Christianity. In the case of the Lenape, there was a religious group that they actually were able to coexist with quite well, and that was the Quakers. The Quaker people and the Lenape actually lived very well together. But what they were able to do then, of course, is share their stories in a non-threatening way. And so from the Lenape, Quakers would have heard descriptions like this that would have conjured images that were, at the very least, devilish, or that would have fit sort of the artistic renderings of demons and devils in the 1600s and 1700s. So the basic story the Jersey Devil, and there are variations of this, is that 1735, a woman named Mother Leeds living in the depths of the Pine Barrens gives birth to her 13th child. Mother Leeds was either a witch or a woman upon whom someone had placed a curse. My favorite version is the one where the child is born and it looks like a natural baby. But then in a short time, even in the immediate wake of the delivery, it starts to change. When the child was born, it looked normal. But then immediately morphed into this amalgam of every sort of creature known and unknown. The mother's screaming. The midwife is screaming. Everyone's confused and scared and terrified. The child then burst through the door to the adjoining room, where Mister Leeds and the prior 12 children are all huddled, scared by the sounds coming from this room. The creature kills as many as it can, and then it flies off into the night, only to be seen on rare occasions or by people who invoke the devil themselves. MARK: You've heard it said many times. There's as many as 30 variations. Probably more than that. JAMES: When Mother Leeds comes into play in the early versions, she's a witch and she is able to sort of shape shift. And I found a really interesting article that made reference to the fact that the Leeds Devil was sort of a European version of a werewolf. And I'm like, "Okay, I get that part." But then there were also versions that Mother Leeds had a child and the father was the devil. But the problem with the whole story is that the real story, the Jersey Devil, has nothing to do with a monster. A physical monster. It's a political story. It is a story that gets to the depths of small town culture versus big town culture, religious culture, land grabs from Native Americans, the crushing of outspoken women. This is the beginnings of fake news in America. It's the beginnings of sensationalist media coverage. It's an American thing before there's an America. This sort of thing is already going on. And so the the story, the Jersey Devil is at the heart of that. [DISTANT SCREECHING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKS] WOMAN: Hello. I've been sent by the agency. [KNOCKS] Hello?

Keep breathing. -In and out. -[SHUDDERS] It's going to be all right. Keep breathing. In and out. In... Good. [INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY] Very good. It's going to be all right, Mrs. Leeds. [SCREAMING] [BONES CRACKLING] [MIDWIFE SCREAMS] [EERIE MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [SPLATTERING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [WHIMPERING] [PANTING] [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] Daniel Leeds. He's the central character. He's what the whole story... If there's no Daniel Leeds, there's no Jersey Devil. He's this really interesting guy. He's a Quaker. The Quakers were people in England. They're religious people. They are Christians who are separatists from the mainstream Anglican church. The Anglicans don't like... the Puritans hate the Quakers. So there are laws being passed in England, Anti-Quaker laws, because they saw the Quakers as subversive. And so what they decide to do is some of them come here to what is then British North America. And now we're talking about 1650s, 1660s. Young. He's like 25. He comes from England. He comes with his father and his two brothers. His contribution to life will be, he's gonna bring the tenants of the scientific revolution and the age of enlightenment to North America. And remember at the time, In the late 1600s, America is the edge of the empire. Rather than having 13 children, he did have 12. One of whom was Titan Leeds, the son of Daniel Leeds. So one of the ways in which Daniel made his mark in his community was by settling an area. He was a land surveyor, so he was gifted a piece of land in order to survey it for the kingdom. And he named it Leeds Town. And while he was there, he started his own almanac. DR. BRIAN: And he thinks, "Okay, this is where I'm going to start this thing. I'm gonna bring education. I want to bring area addition to the to the wilderness." And the Quaker fathers of Burlington hate him. They think it's too occulty, they think it's unchristian and they want to get rid of it. And they literally go around and they buy up every copy that's gotten out into circulation and they burn them. So Daniel Leeds, not just the first author in New Jersey. He's the first censored author in New Jersey. They viewed his almanac as too astrological and is promoting a more esoteric understanding of nature and not something grounded in, you know, thoughts related to God or like God's prophecies, or communicating with God. So, originally, the almanac was published under the Quaker Society. But after the Quakers pushed back, Daniel decided to publish under his own kind of arm or branch instead. And so, the publishing changed, and he leaned more into the astrological end of things. MARK: He published an almanac that was based on astrology, he went on to write a book called the Temple of Wisdom, in which he tried to synthesize all these streams of thought, both of which the Quakers were very much against. They demanded an apology from him, which he gave under duress. But then he went on to write these pamphlets that were virulently anti-Quaker. And again, that got him labeled as the Leeds Devil, essentially. DR. BRIAN: And he flips on the Quakers. He converts to Anglicanism, he starts putting out a new version of the almanac in which he basically attacks Quakerism in every issue. The Quakers are liars. The Quakers are this. The Quakers are that. The Quakers are bad people. The Quakers get mad, so they start publishing anti-Daniel Leeds pamphlets. And so there's this kind of tennis match going back and forth where Leeds publishes an anti-Quaker pamphlet, the Quakers publish an anti-Leeds pamphlet, and it goes on and on like that for a while. There were some instances of anti-Quaker propaganda and then responses that were made by the Quaker groups, including, you know referring to Daniel Leeds in some instances as the Devil himself. As he continued his separation from the Quakers, he started to include his family crest on the almanac, which included dragons on it, and that was seen as a further evidence of a ultimately evil interaction with Satan through his publication of that text. That whole pamphlet war between Daniel Leeds and the Quakers. Quakers accusing him of being Satan's harbinger, of being evil. Obviously, that's the ultimate source of that. There's two monsters here. There is the Jersey Devil, but there's also the Leeds Devil, which comes out first. The Leeds Devil is much more of a political animal. Now, did the Quakers plan on creating a monster legend? You know, probably not. I think that's the ultimate genesis, which takes us, you know, two-hundred-some years later to the thing we know today. Now, this is not attached to a monster yet. It's still just a political idea. Revolution comes along and then the years go by. By the end of the 18th into the early 19th century, up until around the time of the Civil War, the idea of the Leeds Devil basically has gone extinct. But in the second half of the 19th century, post-Civil War, you start to get people talking about the Leeds Devil again. DR. ELEANOR: When we tell the Jersey Devil story, how much of the details can we change until it's no longer the Jersey Devil story and it's something else? How critical are the Leeds to the story being understood and replicated? Because if we think about it, there are tons of versions where Mother Leeds has these different roles that she plays. In some, she is the wife of a wealthy, well-providing man. In some, she's the wife of a drunkard who treats her horribly, abuses their family, is the worst in the world. In some, she is a practicing witch, going against all of the Christian and Quaker values that one could possibly have. In some, she's a scorned lover. I mean, it ranges all across the place for where the origin of this creature came from. But all of it ties back to her, she becomes this central figure. So is she really the protagonist of the Jersey Devil story? Early in the 1600, this is like 1630, 1640, there was a woman named Anne Hutchinson, who was also nonconformist, ran into problems with the Puritan Church in Boston and got kicked out of Boston, essentially. Settled in Providence, Rhode Island. Had a number of children, as many as 16. The 16th child that she had was by our thinking today, our terminology, was a miscarriage. And somehow that became public knowledge, and the Puritans found out about it and used it as a way to smear her name. Essentially, by saying, look, you know, here she is, this rebellious woman. She's pushed against orthodoxies and she had this horrible birth, you know, monstrous birth, by some accounts. And it's just she's getting what she deserved, is what they were probably more than implying. So, that sets in by the mid-1600s, this idea in some of the public's consciousness that a result or consequence for pushing against historical orthodoxies could be that you'd be punished in a very sad and grotesque way. And you see some crossover between Hutchinson and the story of Mother Leeds. It's fairly obvious. [LOW GROWL] Our book, The Secret Life Of The Jersey Devil. It is, in large part, a biography of the Leeds family. Because they are at the heart of this whole thing, especially Daniel Leeds. And what's also interesting is by the time the term 'Leeds Devil' comes along, Daniel and Titan Leeds are gone. [LAUGHS] They never really know that they've been accused, that they played the part in this story. There is no monster. MARK: I don't think necessarily that the historical precedent, although it's extremely intriguing, and the Leeds story as sort of apocryphal and clearly folklore rather than reporting fact. Because as clear as that would seem to be, that doesn't disprove the idea that there's something physically strange or at least startling that no one could find in the Pine Barrens. So what that is, is if it's a horse with bat wings, I mean, I have my doubts about that. But it's not out of the realm of possibility that something strange or misshapen or simply undiscovered, people are encountering that. That seems to be the case wherever people are on these spaces, you know, away from the city, away from the suburbs, and, you know, off of their comfortable turf. We tend to bump into things that we can't recognize right away. [WINGS FLAPPING AND CROWS CAWING] I believe that when people were encountering definitely the Leeds Devil, that they were seeing multiple creatures. And it's just because if you were to line up all the different descriptions that people, especially in the 1909 sightings, what they were seeing, it can't be the same creature. People are seeing multiple known creatures, but because in the back of their mind they've got, "There's a devil out here somewhere. I bet that's what I heard. I bet that's what I saw." Now, that being said, those do not explain all of the sightings. I think that different people have seen different things or heard different things and attributed that to a Jersey Devil sighting, even though they had different experiences, they're all calling it a Jersey Devil encounter. But I think there's also the possibility that we all carry around some imagery in our minds that, you know, is common throughout the world. When you think about everything from totem pole figures to gargoyles to, you know, demonic-looking figures that are depicted in China or India. All over the world, people have this kind of imagery that emerges in different forms of art. I think it's possible that during a frightening moment, when you're maybe by yourself out in the woods and you've heard a strange sound or you saw a form that startled you, it might trigger that kind of imagery. I can only speculate, but that's the only way I can account for the fact that so many people have claimed to have seen the same, you know, or roughly the same thing.
