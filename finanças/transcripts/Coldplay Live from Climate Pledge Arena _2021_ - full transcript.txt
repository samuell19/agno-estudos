There are, there are a few things more frustrating for family members than a frontman who's stuck in a cupboard for two years, it's best to let us out into the wild again. Thank you for letting us come to the first carbon neutral building in the world, I think. And playing the first concert here at the Climate Pledge Arena. We're so grateful to be here and it's a real honor. And we came to Seattle in the year 2000 for our first show here at the Showbox. And I think most of you were there. And it's just basically, we're starting our whole tour here again. So thank you for letting us be a launch pad. This is our mission control, okay.

But it's our only real rock song, so. So we get all pumped up. Now we have to go back to early Coldplay, okay. I'd like to thank those of you who are new to our band, and maybe this is your first show, your first concert of seeing our band. I'd like to thank those of you who have been coming to see us for 10 years or 15 years. Maybe in some cases you've been coming for 20 years, and that's just amazing. We're so lucky, I mean, we were lucky anyway in the first place, but now with everything going on in the world, the fact that we get to gather here together with so many beautiful, beautiful West Coast Americans, it's just a privilege and a joy. I mean, thank you first of all for the visas, because getting into America is not easy, even if you're soft rock superstars. So we're just happy to be here. And thank you for the effort you've made to come to this concert tonight with the pandemic and the travel and the weather and the tickets and all of the rigamarole. If you're sitting way, way, way up in the top there, miles away from us, don't think we don't care about you. And we really do. As far as we're concerned, we're all basically one big family anyway, so thank you. This is a song we played in our first show here in the Showbox and we're going to pay it again now. This is a song called Everything's Not Lost by Coldplay. ♪ When I counted up my demons ♪ ♪ Saw there was one for every day ♪ ♪ With the good ones on my shoulders ♪ ♪ I sent the other ones away ♪ ♪ So if you ever feel neglected ♪ ♪ And if you think that all is lost ♪ ♪ Well I'll be counting up my demons yeah ♪ ♪ Hoping everything's not lost ♪ ♪ Everyone was out to get you ♪ ♪ You could feel it all around ♪ ♪ Well ♪ Let's do that one again. Listen to this musicianship, okay. We're not the best band in the world at playing music, but there's a thing Will, Will will do this thing on the high hat, which just shows he's a truly professional drummer. Ready? You'll see it, you'll hear it. And when you hear him do this thing, please just go totally ape shit, because he doesn't even like playing the drums, he just does it 'cause we're brothers and he's so good at it. ♪ When everyone was out to get you ♪ ♪ You can feel it all around ♪ Here it comes. ♪ Hey don't you let it drag you down ♪ ♪ Well if you ever feel neglected ♪ ♪ If you think that all is lost ♪ ♪ I'll be counting up my demons yeah ♪ ♪ Hoping everything's not lost ♪ ♪ So if you ever feel neglected ♪ ♪ You think that all is lost ♪ ♪ I'll be counting up my demons oh yeah ♪ ♪ Hoping everything's not lost ♪ ♪ Singing out oh oh oh yeah ♪ ♪ Oh oh yeah ♪ ♪ Oh oh yeah ♪ ♪ I know everything's not lost ♪ ♪ Come on yeah ♪ ♪ Oh oh yeah ♪ ♪ Come on yeah ♪ ♪ I know everything's not lost ♪ ♪ Oh oh yeah ♪ ♪ Oh oh yeah ♪ ♪ Oh oh yeah ♪ ♪ I know everything's not lost ♪ ♪ Come on yeah ♪ ♪ Oh oh yeah ♪ ♪ Come on yeah ♪ ♪ Come on yeah ♪ ♪ Oh oh yeah ♪ ♪ Come on yeah ♪ ♪ Everything's not lost ♪ ♪ Oh oh yeah ♪ ♪ Come on yeah ♪ ♪ Oh oh yeah ♪ ♪ I know everything's not lost ♪ Keep it going. ♪ Come on yeah ♪ ♪ Oh oh yeah ♪ ♪ Oh oh yeah ♪ ♪ Come on yeah ♪ ♪ One two three go ♪ Come on, Johnny. ♪ A one two three four ♪ Okay, Will.

So because we're here in Seattle, we wanted to pay tribute to both of the bands that we fell in love with when we were just young teenagers in the '90s. So this is a cover, this is a cover version, this song. But maybe don't upload it onto YouTube, because it's not going to be the best cover version. It's really just a, it's just a tribute. You know what I mean? This is not Adele singing Make You Feel My Love. This is not what you're about to see. This is a 40-year-old, 44-year-old man remembering how much he fell in love with Pearl Jam in 1991. And if you told that kid, he would be here singing this song, that kid would have said, "Are you sure that's a good idea?" And I would've said, "Maybe not." But we're doing it. And so, so for this, please welcome from the drum kit all the way down to the B stage here to play piano on a song that I only made him learn like 25 minutes ago. This is our incredible anchor of a drummer, Mr. Will Champion. Let's bring him down the catwalk. ♪ Once divided ♪ ♪ Nothing left to subtract ♪ ♪ Some words when spoken can't be taken back ♪ ♪ Walks on his own with thoughts he can't help thinking ♪ ♪ Future's above but in the past he's slow and sinking ♪ ♪ Caught a bolt of lightning ♪ ♪ Wished he'd never let it go ♪ ♪ Nothingman ♪ ♪ Nothingman ♪ ♪ Isn't it something ♪ ♪ Nothingman ♪ ♪ She once believed in every story he had to tell ♪ ♪ One day she stiffened and took the other side ♪ ♪ Empty stares from each corner of a prison cell ♪ ♪ One just escapes one stays inside the well ♪ ♪ And he who forgets will be destined to remember ♪ ♪ Nothingman ♪ ♪ Nothingman ♪ ♪ Isn't it something ♪ ♪ Nothingman ♪ ♪ Oh Nothingman ♪ ♪ Nothingman ♪ ♪ Isn't it something ♪ ♪ Nothingman ♪ Thanks, Will.

Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop. Wait, wait, wait, stop. Okay, wait. Okay, so, this is kind of our last song, but. Let's just go underneath the whole bullshit. This is not really our last song. But. I always feel a slight fraud saying, "This is our last song." And then coming back eight times, so. But I will say this, if you could treat it like our last song, that'd be wonderful. And then with full disclosure, after this song, we're going to play a 10 minute ballad, which is a, which if you have school tomorrow or you have a babysitter or you're just plain bored, I would recommend you don't stay around for, okay? So you're totally excused. After this song you could say, "They played the last song. "It was A Sky Full of Stars." "The confetti went everywhere, had a great time," "then I had to go back to bed." It's okay if you want to leave after this song, but we are going to play our favorite song to play in the world after this. Okay, so with that in mind, I'm not really sure if I'm making any sense at all. It's been a while since I've spoken to this many people. I mean, if we were all on Zoom right now, I'd have a lot better chance of making sense. So we'll start this song again. Please give it the Seattle like super power welcome. Okay. Here it is. Here it is, officially our last song.

Well, this really is the last song and we want to say thank you to our crew and to the local crew and to the people that built this arena in time. And we're so grateful and happy to be here. We want to thank Patrick for being six today and introducing the band. And I hope we'll see you again sometime. I think we're coming through here again at some point. I hope so.
