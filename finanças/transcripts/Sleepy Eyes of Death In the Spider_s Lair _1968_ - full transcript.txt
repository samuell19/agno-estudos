Murasaki-sama, you'll recover from your illness... after you enjoy seeing human blood at tonight's event. I believe this is "Big Crow Woods". - Does this go to Yagiri Village? - Yes, yes. What are you so afraid of? Somebody else died. So the crows are making noise over the dead body. Since you're a traveler, you'd better not stay in the village. GRAVE MARKER To sleep in this village forever, that was my mother's will. Yes. You brought her body and buried her all by yourself. Then you told me you'd be on your own from that time on. Kyoshiro-sama, you were 15 years old that winter. - It has been like a dream... - Yes. Your ancestors were one of the huge clans around here, but the castle was destroyed, as well as the temple, when our lord was accused of black magic and punished. Let it be. You should have a good life, rather than... staying here protecting the grave. No, I'll stay here forever. Thank you so much for coming here all the way from Edo. No. I just stopped by here on the way back to Edo. It's been 14 years since you were here... This may be the last time I'll see you... I'm too old now. It's the same. Sooner or later. Kyoshiro-sama. I'll have some tea. Kyoshiro-sama, I must ask you a favor. I don't listen to anyone's requests for favors. Oh no... Someone wants to see you. Hyogo! Yakushiji Hyogo, 19 years old. Your name is Nemuri Kyoshiro! How did you know? I grew up hearing about you from Shichizo! Did you raise him? Yes. Show me your Full Moon Cut! Hyogo! Please! My skill is nothing to teach you. But I get the feeling that your life may end up being very short. That bothers me. My sixth sense can't tell me about anything good, but it can always tell me about something bad. Kyoshiro-sama! Like you, Hyogo was a child of the 'Black Mass'. He wants to die! This village is so depressing. Since evil took over this village, there are no young men or women here. Where did they go? "The Devil's Fortress." - "The Devil's Fortress?" - Yes. The place people call the "The Devil's Fortress" is two ri (4 miles) from here, at the end of Big Crow Woods. Young men and women... from the village are held as prisoners... ...in dungeons there. So travelers are captured, as well. Once they are captured, they never come back alive. Who's living in that place? Domon Ietake-sama. Domon Ietake? I see... He hasn't died yet. I beg of you! Save Hyogo! Tomorrow morning, they'll send their men... to bring Hyogo back there! Hyogo said he can kill them. He won't leave. I told him to run away! I'm a samurai! I don't run away. - Escape, Hyogo! - No! Why don't you flee? For old Shichizo... If you were me, would you run away? See... They say they'll hire me as a retainer. But they're just interested in me as a child of the 'Black Mass'. I'll kill them all! Kyoshiro-sama! I don't think I can convince him, since you, who's like a real father to him, can't. Hyogo-san! Are you going away? Hyogo, please! Run away with me! Hyogo! Please do so! I said I'm not going. - Go by yourself! - No! Go by yourself! Are you that stubborn? I've had enough of pity and scorn! Help us! Save Hyogo's twisted mind! I don't know who you are, but please help Hyogo-san! Go! Leave me alone! Are you a secret Christian? I can't change what's in Hyogo's heart... Besides, I'm against God. Stop! Listen... I'm a child of the Black Mass! You know about the Black Mass! Instead of praying to the Christian God, they worship Satan! A woman is raped in the ceremony! That's how I was born! I'm a child of Satan. Go away! No! I'm not going until you do! - Stupid! Go! - No! Run away with me! - Go! - Hyogo-san... Hyogo-san... Hyogo-san! If I were you, I'd have a peaceful life with the girl. - You're being so childish. - What?! But you probably can't understand me. Bah! You're just a drifter. A villain with your Full Moon Cut and foreigner's blood. That's you! What have you done until now? You're so meaningless! Hyogo! What a terrible thing to say! You're so empty! Have a peaceful life with the girl? Ha! Stop it! That's something you can't even do yourself! You irritate me! When I look at your icy face... I'm not showing myself off as one of Satan's children. Stop it! Don't look at me like that! Yakushiji Hyogo! We'll escort you to the castle. I decline the invitation! You can't. It is Lady Murasaki's wish. Come. Don't kill him! Murasaki-sama will be upset. You! Little bastard! Is Lady Murasaki the sister of Domon Ietake? Who are you? Your name! Nemuri Kyoshiro. Domon's Chief Retainer, Tasuke Juroji. Oh. Don't worry. I'll go with you instead. Leave me alone. I don't need your help! A 19 year old boy isn't... as much fun to torture and kill as a man like me. If you say no, I'll have to fight you. Very well, come with me. Omitsu... Omitsu! You came here instead of Yakushiji Hyogo? Nemuri Kyoshiro is a strange name. Your hair is red. I'm a child of Satan, like Hyogo. That's why I came here. If you want to work here, I'll make you a retainer. I don't want that. Then what do you want? I don't want anything in this world. Just for you to leave Yakushiji Hyogo alone. Kaede, show him in. Stand up. You're much better looking than Yakushiji Hyogo. Kyoshiro, let's have fun tonight. Hyogo wasn't to be a samurai retainer, but only as your toy for the night. What are you complaining about? I'm the daughter of Shogun Ienari. Yes, I know. Domon Ietake and Murasaki committed Seppuku in Edo 2 years ago. That was the official story. But you are still alive. Kofu is the Shogun's land. You can do whatever you want. That's right. The dead cannot make complaints. Whenever I think of Edo, I get depressed being in such a remote place. Kyoshiro, please make me happy! After you had your fun with men, how many of them have been killed? What number am I to be? Are you afraid of me? You said you're a child of the 'Black Mass'. What do they do to the woman at the ceremony? Not even the Black Mass can compare to your viciousness. I'm so honored to hear that I outdo Satan himself! You're a child of the Shogun's mistress. People looked down on you and your brother as bad seeds. Anger and sadness from being inferior caused your evil deeds. Perhaps, it's a show for your father, Shogun Ienari. Kyoshiro. I'll win if seeing my naked body gets you excited, then you'll do whatever... I want you to, alright? Let me see. I'm too used to that kind of woman's body. Don't you have anything for me? If not, then... Kyoshiro! Excellent! I'll give you a beast to match your skill. Is he Nemuri Kyoshiro? I'll beat him first. Kumade! Withdraw! Ronin! I'm Domon Ietake! Take my arrows! There is poison at the tip of each one! Even if you're just slightly touched by one, you'll die! Damn it! Kumade! Are you the slave of Murasaki? Since you're just a killer beast, I feel sorry for the great Masamune sword. Halt! You'll say to respect the princess since she's a member of royalty. Hey! Why don't you have more respect for the lives of those you've killed? Hey! - Princess! - Princess..! - Don't let him escape! Chase him! - Hurry up! My lord! A Shogunate Inspector from Edo Castle, Miyakoda Ikkan-sama. He wants to see you. What? You still play with poison, don't you, sir? This is one I got from the Dutch yesterday. Unlike other poisons, this one kills you slowly. It's perfect for killing the Shogun or a senior councilor. Ietake-sama! Watch your tongue! I'll show them! I'll show those in the government who put me here a lesson. I wonder what's going on in your castle? Why'd you come? The Shogun is concerned about you, after hearing disgraceful rumors in Edo. I understand that this place is remote, but try to have... a more peaceful life here, please. What is... the real reason you came all the way to Koshu from Edo? I died two years ago by Seppuku. I've disappeared from the world already. Disgraced by Domon Ietake? I don't know what you're talking about! I'm ready to die if I have to! Whatever you are doing here must stop immediately! You'll disgrace the government. Obey the Shogun's direct order. - That's enough! - No! I'm very concerned about you, sir! Miyakoda-sama. How are you? I'm glad to see you well. You're as beautiful as ever, Princess Murasaki! A compliment from a tough man like you. Since becoming an Ometsuke (Inspector General), you should be keen not only at sword skill, but at knowledge. What should we do about Nemuri Kyoshiro? I've taken care of that matter. Shichizo! Kyoshiro-sama...! Hyogo... Hyogo...! Was he taken to the castle?! Shichizo! Please take care of Hyogo... He grew up saying... he would become a samurai like you. The poor child can only express his true feelings when attacking someone. Please take care of my boy... Kyoshiro-sama... my boy... my boy... Hyogo-san! We need you in order to get Kyoshiro. I'll kill you after that. Enjoy your short life as a dog until then. Kumade! Hyogo-san! Well, how can we get Kyoshiro? Excuse me. I see you are Nemuri Kyoshiro-dono. Who are you? Kogi Ometsuke, Miyakoda Ikkan. Oh... How do you know who I am? At Domon Ietake-sama's castle. I heard about you. Well, I'd like to make it clear that I'm not your enemy. I have a favor to ask of you. I try not to help anybody. I told this dead old man the same thing. So, you want me to kill Domon Ietake. That's right. I need more of an explanation. My mission is to find out what's going on at the castle... and convince Ietaka-sama to behave. If he doesn't listen, then to secretly... assassinate Ietaka-sama. Why should I help the Shogun kill his own stupid son?! If it's an order from the Shogun, you should do it yourself. Ietake-sama and I both attended Yushima Seido school as children. Please understand how I feel! I see. Since it's the Shogun's wish, I won't be punished if I kill him. When Ietaka-sama was in Edo, there were many mysterious deaths among top government members. Plus, people said that Ietake-sama was in love with his sister Princess Murasaki, and he killed her two husbands to destroy the arranged marriages. In order to preserve the Shogun's face, he was exiled to this remote place after a sham suicide. I see. Ietake's in love with his sister... The brother and sister together enjoy murdering people. What insanity! But... How can I kill him? Please! Please help me! There's someone at Devil's Fortress I want to bring back here alive. But I don't know whether or not I'll kill Ietake. Please go home. Woman, look at me! It's cold in here. Drink this. - Drink it, hurry! - Yes. - Stand up! - Yes. Honnosuke! This poison works very well. Take the body out! Juroji! Juroji! Somebody! Take a turn! Hyogo, look at this. Do you want to live? Yes, please help me. If you do what I say, I'll send you home. That's a lie! Don't be fooled! If you rape the girl I pick, here in front of everybody, I'll let you go home. Haru! Yes, that's Haru. Your woman. Don't you want to go home? Do you want to live? Yes, I do... Yes, I want to live...! Haru! If you oppose me, there will be more pain waiting for you. Damn you! What are you waiting for?! That's enough. If you don't, you'll die! Haru! Haru! Damn you! Kill me! You! Kill him! Headache again? The poor princess. Nemuri Kyoshiro is quite a man. It seems like neither you nor I can conquer him! Do you love him? The man who shamed you! I ordered Juroji to kill him. Juroji is not his match. I'll do it myself. Just like you did with my two former husbands? Yes. I'll kill him. He's different than the others. In order to kill him, you should plot special stratagems. I know. Who are you? I'm a stranger to this person in the grave, but since I'm going to die soon myself, I can't help but pray for him. Die... Are you going to die? After suffering from a bad illness for a long time, my money is all gone. I tried to get help from the villagers, but nobody cared about me! Oh, please wait! I'm from a samurai family. I don't want pity as a beggar. Then what do you want? Please buy my body. It is less shameful to sell your body than to accept alms? For my last moments in this world, I'd like to spend time with a person like you... There are a lot of mosquitoes in here. Please come inside. Do you want me to remove the scarf from my face? Do you have an ugly face like a monster? Please understand there's a reason... for me having a scarf around my face. I don't care. Thank you very much. But I ask you one thing. You seem to have come from a samurai family. You have refinement... So why don't you have any men in your life? Is it leprosy? A man's desire disappears... when he sees this disfigured face! It really depends on who the man is. A woman with an evil illness? Your body is not infected at all. What will you do? Do you still want to sell your body? Yes, I'll sell it. She must have been your woman, but she spent her last moments... in the this world with me enjoying heavenly bliss! Pardon me! Sir! Is Nunobiki town very far from here? About 2 ri. May I accompany you? This village is so spooky. I'm not going to Nunobiki. I'm honored that you're welcoming me personally. Murasaki is desperately waiting to see your head. I came to get Hyogo back from that crazy woman. Stop! Withdraw! Show me your Full Moon Cut! Let me at him! Kyoshiro, you have lost! It's too late! The poison will travel through your whole body... and you'll soon die! Chase him! Hey, hey! We must find him any way we can! I'll hang him from a tree to feed the crows! - Did you find him? - No, sir! Find him! Find him! This is my last time... to see the color of the sky. Thank you very much. Ietake-sama loves to poison people. So I always carry a poison antidote with me. I'm glad that it saved your life. My legs and arms are still numb. Just move them. They will be fine by tomorrow morning. However, I know how upset... one who never lost before must be to come this close... to death. If you still want to kill Domon Ietake, then I can't help you. I saved your life. You have an obligation to help resolve my difficult situation. I thanked you already. Since I did not ask you to help me, I don't owe you anything. Please help me... For our nation and people! "For our nation and people." It makes my hair stand on end. I thank Domon Ietake for putting me in a near death experience. Welcome! Oh, sir? Please bring it here. One glass. And saké, too. Are you alright? Oh, sorry if I'm asking too many questions. But you seem like you're from Edo, and I'm from Asakusa, as well. Asakusa... My house is behind Yoshiwara, Jokan-ji. Oh, I'm glad to hear that, and besides, now you're talking to me. Please have a saké. Drink the saké! Drink! Well, I don't know what you may be thinking. Please don't startle me! The way you react, you're not only an expert at men, but of some combat as well. Besides, the smell of your body. You don't like it? It's too expensive a scent for a woman from the town. I give up. Why did you follow me here? Tell me who you are. Yes... I'm not from the town. My brother was a Hatamoto (Bannerman) in Honjo Arigesui, Murai Kanbei. He was an expert in the Maniwa Nen-ryu style. But he died of a serious illness. Are you Domon Ietake's woman? You knew it... As I suspected. I was a servant of Murasaki-sama. I was forced to come to this remote place with them, so far away from Edo, and with nothing to do. Did he order you to kill me? I'm not going to kill you. When I saw you the first time, I fell in love with you. A trap with a woman as bait is too ordinary. If it was a trap, I'd already have tried to kill you. Please... help me! Take me back to Edo with you! Then, seduce me first, Maniwa Nen-ryu. Murasaki-sama, do you really care about Kyoshiro? Did you send Suma? Yes. She's probably seduced and killed him by now. Kumade! Now, let me see what kind of tricks you have. Please don't say that! How can I tell you my true feelings for you? Hold me... Hold me tight! They're here. Kyoshiro... please continue loving a woman with no class! Tasuke! Don't let her go! Kumade! The fellow called Tasuke Juroji... has been following me since Nunobiki town. Sorry that I'm still alive. You're very sarcastic, as usual. You don't know what happened to Yakushiji Hyogo, do you? If you hurt him, I'll take your life, too. Kyoshiro, come to the house... at the end of Big Crow Woods around dusk to see Hyogo! Yes, that's the best way... for you, my lord, and Murasaki-sama... Shut up! I don't need your advice! What will we gain if we kill the stray ronin? If we continue to fight with him, it's clear we'll receive more damage. We should free Yakushiji Hyogo, then everything will be fine. Then, I'll have lost to him! Kaede! You want me to take an insult? My lord... I'm the nanny of you and Murasaki-sama. I couldn't sleep at night if something happened to her. Don't worry. I'll kill Kyoshiro myself. Ikkan! What have you done?! Are you talking about Kyoshiro? Why did you help him? He's a villain who has given up on this world. However, he knows a lot of important people in our government. If someone questions his death, it won't be good for Ietake-sama's situation. It's none of your business! I, Ikkan, came here today with my decision! Do you want to kill me? I... can't kill you, my lord. Then, will you kill yourself to show me your loyalty? Yes. That's fine... Go ahead. I'll watch you die. You, commit Hara-Kiri...! So, if I perform Hara-Kiri, will you stop your evil acts? Your life won't change anything! I'll do whatever I want! Murasaki! I'll kill Kyoshiro by myself! I don't think you can kill him. What? I'll do whatever I want to get him. Please leave me alone! He is not easy! I must let him know how I was insulted as a woman, and he should be punished in the same way! Murasaki. You really are in love with him. Unacceptable! My pride as a member of the Domon clan won't accept that! As you have pride in our Domon clan, I have my pride as a woman. I have already set up a trap to insult him before I kill him. I don't think he'll be caught. But if I use the name "Yakushiji Hyogo", he'll come even though he knows it's a trap. Kyoshiro is that kind of man. I told him to come at dusk. But he'll come to the house before that. Where is the house? I can't tell you. I set a trap for Kyoshiro. He's not the kind of man who will fall into a trap. What happens then, will happen. I'll think about something else. Murasaki! Don't let him touch your body! Murasaki! Wait! You! Move! Kumade! Damn it...! There are...! Suma... Kumade! Tell Ietake... that I'll exchange Murasaki for Hyogo! Kumade... do as he says. - Princess... - Go..! - My lord! - Fool! You failed to kill him, and lost Murasaki to him! My lord! Let's move quickly! Crows are eating dead bodies. I think you're a man with a good heart. You are a monster. Nobody can save you. Do I perhaps resemble you a little? That's why you irritate me so! I believe you're the perfect man for me. I want to be with you and to be cared for by you. If I gave you back Hyogo, would you listen to my wishes? I'll get Hyogo back on my own. Why do you care about Hyogo so much? A son of the Black Mass... I just want Hyogo to have a good life. That's all. Kyoshiro... I've no desire to have you. But let's see what Death looks like. Crows eat dead bodies outside! A dead woman on the cross in front of us! This is our party, that we created. Shout with joy. They're coming! They're coming! My lord! Kyoshiro has come! - Hey, get him! - Yes! Hyogo! Who are you? It's me! Hyogo! I'm a child of the Black Mass... I wanted to be you. But I also wanted to be myself. I don't know... if I was wrong or right... Hyogo! Kyoshiro! As you wish, I'll give Hyogo back to you! I'll take your eyeballs out, too! Where is Ietake? Please forgive me, but I'm asking with my very life. Would you please leave the castle right now? What are you talking about? You're also a party to this. If you think it's out of loyalty to him, you're wrong! It's alright to kill people who are peasants. But because he's nobility, he should not be killed? Everything's for your convenience! Please... I give my life for Ietake-sama... Fool! Killing yourself won't change anything! A samurai's code of mercy... I have no such thing. But by my own personal mercy, I shall assist! Murasaki! Kyoshiro did hold me. No, I held Kyoshiro! Brother, it is alright, isn't it? You! Kyoshiro taught me love and hate! Do you want to save him? I'll kill him. I'll kill him. You walked through my world with dirty shoes. From now on, whether we're alive or dead, we'll be separate. Murasaki! I warn you that I don't need any help killing Kyoshiro. I'll kill him. Where's Hyogo-san? He's dead. Hurry up! This way! The escaped prisoners are setting fire to the castle. It will be perfect for us if Kyoshiro kills Ietake and Murasaki. Everything will burn down and only ashes will be left. Your work here will be a great credit to your career in Edo. Your future high ranking post will be waiting for you in Edo. That's right. Splendid! And the fool that committed Hara-Kiri to prove his loyalty. We'll divide the 50,000 ryo left in the castle between us. What are you doing? Kyoshiro! For your last moment in this world, I'll let you see my Full Moon Cut. Come on! My job is done. Kyoshiro! If you live, your life will be full of blood! Thank you very much. The Domon, an evil clan, is abolished. I made your job easy. The Shogunate will be saved. As will you. THE END
