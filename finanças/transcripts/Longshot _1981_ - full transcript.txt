We are unbeatable! Woo! - You play soccer for me and I will make sure that you get a full scholarship and everything will be taken care of. - Sounds real good, son. - It certainly does. - Ah, it is good. - [Mr. Rogers] What do you say, hm? - I've decided to go to Europe and become a pro. - Europe? Just how in the hell do you intend to finance this little venture? - By winning the Foosball Spectacular in Lake Tahoe. - Foosball? - You what?! You turned down a scholarship because I couldn't go?! - Damn right, man. We're partners. We've talked about Europe. We're gonna do it. - Maybe you oughta think about this a little. - Look, I have, this is the right move. - Yeah, but the pros. Man, I don't know. - Look, Leroy, I turned down Stanford. You can't cop out on me now. - I'm not copping out on you! But talking is one thing. - It's time we found out whether we've got it or we don't! (energetic rock music) - They got girls in Europe? - Tall ones, just tall ones. - I'll do it. (Paul laughs) - [Paul] All right! But we gotta win this tournament. We've only got two weeks to get ready. - [Leroy] It's in the bag. We'll sign up for a couple open tournaments, keep ourselves sharp, and nothing can stop us. I've been thinking. - [Paul] Leroy, I don't want to hear any of your schemes, all right. - [Leroy] Just listen! SC is a sure thing to beat the spread. You've been making it work long enough to realize that gambling's for suckers. We could do Tahoe in style. - [Paul] No way. - What's this, Tahiti Tan? (cheerful music) - Whatever happened to Manny's Adult Books? - [Leroy] No more sleazy girly magazines? - The neighborhood was up in arms, so I had to clean up my act. - You owe me 110. - "You owe me 110." You know you got a big mouth for a little kid. This is it, man, I mean it. - Come on, Manny, nobody loses all the time. - You never seen my wife. - People actually tan themselves here or what? - Hey, it's safer than the sun. Only takes a few minutes. You guys want to give it a try? (tanning bed buzzing) - This is great. Cindy loves that bronze Adonis look! - Yeah, on anybody. - You don't think she's devoted to me? - [Paul] You and about 10 other guys. You're just part of the parade. - That's a cold shot, man. You're just jealous, admit it. (buzzing) - Let's go, Romeo. - I want to go for that golden glow. Hey Manny, a couple more minutes! I don't know, man, I think I overdid it. - Maybe she has a thing for Spider-Man. - Ha ha ha. Look at that. She's with that jerk again. I don't believe it. - [Paul] No eggs, Leroy. - [Leroy] Just a couple of jumbos. (splattering) - Leroy! - Did you throw those? Goddammit! - What are you doing with this creep?! - Leroy, let go of him! You asshole, Leroy! What are you doing?! - Come on, Cindy, I want to talk to you! - I can't, I have to practice! Leroy, what happened to your face? You look like Spider-Man. - [Leroy] Might want to get that face cleaned up! - You're such a baby, Leroy! - That's the problem that happens when you look at a lady! It's a fight to keep the wolves away! Oh shit! - [Football Player] Get outta here, man! - [Announcer] Next up, the Huevos versus the Foosketeers. - Are you guys the Mousketeers? - Flip the coin. - Call it in the air. - Tails never fails. - I got a feeling things are gonna go that way all night.

(chickens clucking) Agh, damn coyotes! Hello, boys. What on earth happened? - Romeo punched a van. - Well I assume your venture to win the foosball tournament will be affected by this misfortune and that Lake Tahoe is out. - And Europe and the pros. - I see. How about another partner? Not that you could be replaced, Leroy. You are one of a kind. - Already told him about another guy, but he won't listen. - You just can't put two people together and expect them to play like they know each other. They gotta know what the other guy's gonna do before he does it. - It's a long shot, I agree, but in my gambling days, before I started making book, my first rule was cut your losses. - And did it work? - I'm still here. - What's this guy's name? - Max. ♪ Everybody says you're the best in town ♪ ♪ I'm giving you the chance ♪ To show me now ♪ Everybody calls you king of the hill ♪ ♪ Let's find out if you fit the bill ♪ ♪ One on one ♪ Just you and me - Shit! - Too bad, hot shot. - Too bad for you!

All you do is sit back and criticize. - You think it's easy to sit and watch you mess up? - You got a big mouth, Leroy! - Hey! Now listen, it wasn't her fault, Leroy! We were both off tonight! Now Max, Leroy is just as much a part of this team as you are. He can see what's happening, he can see what's going on when he's not in the heat of the game. Now you're a terrific goalie or else you wouldn't be here. But he's gonna give us that edge and we're gonna take it. All right? - All right. - Leroy? So let's get to work. - All right, this is what I like to do. I like to give them an opening and then take it away. Opening and then take it away. All right? You try. Better.

I guess I was about 12 years old. There was this guy on first, I was playing second, and there was a guy at short stop. He was an older kid named, uh, Julio. Now to tell him that we need to get a double play too, it was kinda difficult. He didn't speak English very well. And so the next guy up hits a hot grounder right to the shortstop. And instead of scooping it up with his mitt, he pops it up with his foot, and just as it's coming up, he kicked it right to me. I couldn't believe it. We got the double play, we won the game and everything. It was great. - He was a soccer player? - The first one I ever met. Ever since then he couldn't get rid of me. I went to all his games. He taught me how to play right. I even used to dribble one to school. Everyone used to think I was crazy, you know, soccer in America. That's why I want to go to Europe. I think you saw that last night. If that had been a football game, the stands would've been packed. Were you talking about your father? - There's not much to say really. When my parents divorced, I was living with my mom, and I went with my father. But he's not used to that. I'm a very great responsibility for him. - I can tell that already. - Are you making fun of me? - No. I'd just like to take some of that great responsibility off your father's shoulders. - You want me to be crazy like you? - Why not, you might like it.

She's been lured away by that boy. - Yes, Mr. Bresson. Paul tells me that your daughter is 18. That is no longer a child. She is a woman. You as a Frenchman should understand this is an affair of the heart. (speaking in a foreign language) - What did he say? - Oh. Love's passion like the flight of the seagull, will not be tamed. - Oh. - I know people in Tahoe. Let me handle this. I make a quick telephone call, I track the kids down. I really think it's a bad idea to bring the cops in on this. - You can use the telephone in the kitchen. Mind the rooster! (determined rock music) - Here you go. - [Announcer] In open doubles, Table 26, Games Galore playing Twang Fine Fever on 26. Table 28, Jupiter Number One playing Foos and Fun on 28. Table 34, Dixieland Amusement playing. (announcer drowned out by clacking) - Holy shit. - Promotional bullshit. Let's sign up. - Oh you betcha. - Hey, bruisers, how you doing? I'm Trent. You're? - The New Huevos. - Yeah. - Hi, how you doing? Paul Rogers, Max Gripp. - Hi, Max. - Leroy Curtis, our alternate. - Trent, you must be the Head Fooser, huh? - Uh, yeah, you got it. - Hey tell me, are the Grigaitis brothers here yet? - Uh, yeah. The Grigaitis brothers, uh, in the corner. (speaking in a foreign language) - Excuse me, are you guys the famous Grigaitis brothers? - Yes, we are. - We're the New Huevos. Just came here to wish you luck. - And to tell you we're gonna kick your asses. - Well that was real subtle, Max. Now they're gonna be laying for us. - [Max] I can't do anything right. (door slams) - [Motel Manager] Okay, open up now! Or I'm gonna call the police! - Great, just great! (knocking on the door) (motel manager shouting) - Yeah Moe, I got my man Struthers on it. Yeah, he says that the kids are registered for the tournament, but, uh, they're not staying at the hotel. No, they're not. Are you coming up here? Okay. Will do, bye. Struthers, I want you to follow up on this. - All right. - What's the manager gonna do? - Nothing. - She can turn our names into the cops. - What are they gonna do, arrest us for having a couple of girls in our room? - They might, if they knew one of them was 14. - Now how are they gonna know that? - If my mother tells them. - Why would she do that, Max? - Why would she do that, Max? - I don't know! - Max! - She might be looking for me. - What? - Well I didn't tell her I was coming here exactly. Anyway, we have nothing to worry about. If she don't know where I am, how will she know where to look? - Now we're in real trouble, a runaway. Dammit! - Shall we jump? - Very funny. - Oh, it's devil may care Paul Rogers. A few setbacks and no more jokes, eh? - A few setbacks? Look, I've got a lot riding on this tournament. It's my ticket to Europe. I turned down a scholarship for this chance. I get kicked out of a cheap motel, I'm broke, and on top of that my goalie's a runaway. Look, for all I know, every cop in California is looking for her and for me. And besides that, I probably don't even have a chance in hell of winning the foos tournament in the first place. - I don't understand you. You who doesn't let anything in the way of what he wants, suddenly you don't have a chance? - Forget I said that. - No, I want to know what you mean. - I really don't want to talk about it. - Have it your way. You want to shove me out, fine. - Wait a minute. - No, you want to give up, you can do it alone. I don't want to be part of that. - Where are you going? - Back to L.A. - What are you gonna do, walk? - Don't worry, I'll get a ride. - Come on. - I don't want to be with someone who wants to lose. - I didn't say I wanted to lose! - But that's your attitude. - Look, let's start again. I, I was just feeling sorry for myself. And, and I really don't want to fight. - I don't want to fight either. Nothing has happened that can't be fixed. (waves crashing) - Well? - It's cool. What's the problem? - Max. - Look, why don't you lay off me? I told you I left her a message. - Yeah, that you were with me. - Well if I tell her where I'm at, she's gonna want me to go home, then where are we gonna be? - Okay, so some things can't be fixed. - What next? - Next, we register at the Caesar Tahoe. - And what are we gonna do for money? - Voila. We charge everything on this, and when we win, we pay. - Oh brother. Slot machines? Where's Galaxian or Pac-Man? (cheerful music) - Oh my god! (upbeat music) I can't lose. - Wow! - Oh man, look at this place! Look at the view! - Oh my god. - Wow. - All right! It's great. - [Max] Wow! Wonder if they have any arcades around here. - [Leroy] Are you kidding? This whole town's an arcade. - All right, I didn't know you could write. - Don't bug me, mouth. I told you, this is Leroy's day. It is a definite no-lose situation. - You're not talking about downstairs, are you? - I certainly am. You are looking at the man that broke the bank at Caesar's Tahoe. - How? You're underage. - So? Success. - You've gotta be kidding. - What's the matter with it? - You couldn't fool Ray Charles with it. - You ever thought about becoming a brain surgeon? - Everybody's a critic! (Marie-Christine laughs) I think it's pretty damn good. I'm gonna try it. - This I've gotta see. - Follow me. - [Max] Right behind you. (people shouting) - You want to get in on this? - You gotta be kidding me! (people shouting) - Roll eight. I always make eight. - One moment, please sir. Excuse me, may I see some ID, please? - Sure. - Step this way. (people shouting) (relaxing music) - Come here often? - Only when I'm depressed. - Charming. - That Paul Rogers is such a snake in the grass! - I'd like to put hands on him. - Maybe we should go up there tomorrow. - I agree. - Oh I don't know, Henri. Sometimes I think I've neglected Maxine. Poor kid. When I do pay attention to her, it's to come down on her for something. It's not easy being a single parent. I like going out, fooling around. You know what I mean? - Yes. (laughs) You know, sometimes it's the same thing with me. I put too many, how, how do you say in English, too many squeezes on my daughter. - Squeezes? - Yes. - You, you squeeze her too much? - You know. - Oh. (laughs) You don't mean squeezes. You mean restrictions. - (laughs) Pardon, oui, restrictions! That's now the word, I know it! I put too many restrictions on her. - Those poor kids. No wonder they ran away. Oh god, now I'm feeling guilty. Probably living out of a car. (everyone laughing) - Man, I had this poor man going for a while. Even had him convinced I was a high roller. - Leroy, you live in a soap bubble. - (laughs) You're so funny, Max. - About as funny as the plague. - I'd like to propose a toast to my very special friends, the New Huevos. - I'll drink to that. (glasses clinking) - [Server] Anything else? - Uh, just the damages. (lush orchestral music) - Well, sports fans. We now owe Caesar's Tahoe seven big ones. (excited rock music) (announcer chattering) Hey, that's some shot you got there. En-May. - You're a player? - Manager. - En-May's boyfriend's our manager. That's him out by the car. - Is that supposed to mean something to me? - [May-Wah] Only if he catches you talking with En-May. (aloof rock music) (announcer chattering) - Kansas City, right? - Yeah. - We're the New Huevos. You guys ready to go? - Yeah, but uh, this isn't mixed doubles. - I know. - Okay. (fun music) (announcer chattering) Yeah, yeah! (high-spirited music) (Kansas City player cries out) - Hey! - Hey! (Paul laughs) (happy rock music) - Nice game. (perky rock music) (people cheering) - All right! (successful music) - So, what'd you find out? - Where you been? They won the match on table 14 five minutes ago. They in some kind of trouble? - No no no. Have them report to the security office when you see them, okay? - Sure. - Leroy, you better be out of there, because I want to take a shower. - Wait your turn, slave. - [Max] But I can't! - Max, get outta here! (Max screams) Max, get outta here! Get outta this tub right now! Get outta here! (Max laughs) - Oh, I'm such a lousy mother. - Thank you. They are not responding. - Oh crap, we're gonna have to drive. - Crap. - I've been thinking. Maybe we oughta get team outfits. - That's not a bad idea. Who ordered caviar? - I did. - Max, what are you doing? You don't eat caviar that way. - Why not? - Do you know what those are? - Sure, little berries. - Berries? Those are fish eggs, you twit.

Nobody does! - Look, that's not true! - It is true! - [Paul] Max, will you listen to me! - No! You're just like everybody else! Well you can find yourself a new partner because I don't want to be on your team anymore! - Look, Max, just listen! (smooth rock music) Right now we gotta find Max. - This is gonna be like finding a needle in a haystack, oui? - You better believe it. Listen, we gotta find her. She's only a kid!

(crowd applauding and cheering) (epic rock music) - [Announcer] This is the final match. (triumphant rock music) Introducing last year's world champions, the Grigaitis Brothers. (audience applauds and cheers) And the challengers, playing with an alternate, Leroy Curtis, the New Huevos! (audience applauds and cheers) - I'm gonna toss the coin in the air. New Huevos, you call it. - Heads. (coin clinks) - The Grigaitis Brothers have won the toss. Gentlemen. (dramatic rock music) (audience applauds and cheers) - You all right? - Yeah. - [Announcer] Grigaitis Brothers one, New Huevos zero. - [Paul] Gonna be okay? - Yeah, yeah, fine. (persevering rock music) (audience applauds and cheers) - [Announcer] Grigaitis Brothers two, New Huevos zero. (resolute rock music) (audience applauds and cheers) Grigaitis Brothers three, New Huevos zero. - Max! Max. They need you in there! - They don't need me! They need a goalie! - That's right, because the one they have is playing in pain. We've been looking for you last night, not because you're a goalie, but because we were worried about you. - Ha! Paul doesn't give a shit about anything but winning this tournament! - So you came back to watch him lose? Is that your revenge? - No! I came back to get my things. - And watch him lose. - [Max] Listen! - No, you listen now! It's time for you to grow up a little. Even if what you think about Paul is true, you've got a responsibility to yourself and to the team to play. Are you feeling too sorry for yourself to see that? And you're talking about no one caring about you. You're the only one who doesn't care about anyone! - Okay. So I'm a jerk. Let's go. (Henri gasps) - Henri! - I'm sorry! Oh come on! Pardon, pardon! (audience applauds and cheers) - [Announcer] Grigaitis Brothers score! - [Evelyn] Maxine Gripp, don't you take another step! - [Max] Oh shit. - You've got some explaining to do, young lady! (shouting in a foreign language) (everyone shouting over each other) - The same thing that's been going through my mind every time you and that creepy boyfriend of yours come stumbling in the house at 3:00 in the morning to get to the bedroom! - Oh that's enough mouth, missy! I am still your mother! - It's so nice to be back in the bosom of my family! - Okay, okay, that's it, you are grounded indefinitely! Okay come on, let's go, we're going home! - I'm not going! - What? - I'm grounded indefinitely! What else can you do to me?! - Pardon, pardon. Excuse me. Can I say something? - Uh, yes. - Do you know this is the national championship? - So what? - Can you imagine Max as a national champion? And also there is the matter of the prize money, $50,000. - 50,000? For foosball? (hopeful music) (audience applauds and cheers) - [Announcer] The Grigaitis Brothers lead, two games to none. One more game and they are world champions for the third year in a row. (determined rock music) - [Max] Move! Let me in! Coming through! Move it, you grease spoon! - Time, time! - Your hour has arrived, suckers. Boy I never thought I'd be glad to see you. - Listen Max, you don't have to-- - Look, cut the crap, let's play. - This is your goalie? (laughs) You'd better stick with the cripple. - Maybe you'd better button your lip, candy ass. - [Audience] Oh! - [Announcer] Maxine Gripp replaces Leroy Curtis for the New Huevos. (audience applauds) (vigorous rock music) (audience applauds and cheers) (speaking in a foreign language) - Hey! Talking over. Play. (persevering rock music) (audience applauds and cheers) (speaking in a foreign language) - Hey, hey! Hey, Tour of Italy, play! (serious rock music) (audience applauds and cheers) - [Announcer] New Huevos have won two games in a row. What a comeback! New Huevos are one point away from the world championship!

(waves crashing) - You know, there was something I wanted to-- - [Leroy] Yeah, I know. We came down on each other kind of hard, didn't we? - I'm sorta glad it happened though. It opened my eyes up to a lot of things. I guess I was using you. - You're not the only one. I was using you too. Messing up on purpose just to test your friendship. I needed it that much. It ain't too healthy, is it? - Maybe you're just a natural screw-up, Leroy. - Maybe, but you still like me. - Sure you won't change your mind about Europe? - Yeah, I'm sure. I'm just not in that league. Let's face it. (thoughtful music) - I'm really gonna miss you, pal. - Well we gotta move on, right? The fact is, when I get out of this cast, I was thinking of moving to forward. - You were, huh? - Yeah. - Who were you gonna use for a goalie? - I was kind of thinking of using you. - Is that a fact? - Yeah, that's a fact. - Maybe you oughta consult me about it. - What's the matter, you don't want to be my partner? - I didn't say that! - Then what are you saying?! - I don't know! - Well explain yourself! You either want to play for me or you don't want to play for me! - Shut up! - Oh I don't want to hear that! That's it, that's it! - You never want to hear it! - No more talk like that, all right!
