Come on, Rita! Give it a shove. A shove. Wow, nice one! -Quit it, I got the special. -A slap save… What special are you on? None, goddammit. You got nothing. Give it a shove, I'm telling you! A shove, for God's sake. -Tilt! -Yeah, you suck. What did you expect? Look, I got the jackpot. Oh, yeah. Me too. Shit, you're making so much noise! So much for being discreet, eh? Can't you cut it out? Leave it! Don't touch that. I know, I didn't call you. But nothing's happening right now. On top of that, I can't shake this awful flu. I haven't been out in ten days, at least. -It's the 15th today, right? -Yeah. Why? You told me the delivery was on the 15th? The Marseille boys are in Paris? -Where? -No. I'm not doing that. I can't. Not right now. They're getting suspicious, it's going to blow up in my face. I can't! Listen, I'll give you their hideout in Marseille. You can just go bust them there. And anyway, this is last time they'll be in Paris. Exactly! No. I can't do that. I'm sorry, but I can't. I can't! Alright. I'm leaving. What are you doing? Stay right there. Alright. Whenever you're ready. I'm in no rush. Look. Stop the siren! Stop it! Stop the siren! I'm going to get in deep shit, for fuck's sake! Stop it! Shit, he cracks me up. Who's that? Ah, it'll be for me. It's my food, I ordered some. Who is it? Room service, sir. On the ground. Police! Don't move, boys. Don't move! Take this. Handcuff yourselves together! What are you doing here? Don't stand around. Get out of here! Hey! You, stay there. Sit down over there. -Handcuff yourselves. Hurry up. -Alright, alright! -Calm down, little guy. No worries. -Quickly. On the sofa. OK, I did it. I'm sitting now. What's wrong with you? Why are you treating me like that? Why? -Sit down! -Jean-Paul, sit down, come here! Here. Calm down. Leave him alone. Hey, not a move from you either. Hey! I'm going to get dressed. Look. See? We did it. -Shut your mouth. -It's fine. Calm down. -What are you doing? -Nothing. -Hey, hey! Sit back down. -Cool it. Sit down. -What is that? -What? What's that? -Where did that briefcase come from? -That's not ours! -We've never seen that! -A guest must have left it. It's not ours, anyway! -You'll do ten years for this. -No way. You can't pin this on us. You think you can just set us up like that? You can stay put as well, please. Hey! Are you deaf? -I've got nothing to do with this. -It's true. We just picked her up at a club. She had no idea! -No. You have to stay here. -This is getting intense. Stay put! I told you to… Start that again and I'll cuff you. I can't let you leave. Ah! Here. Not that way. Come. Here, this way. There. This is ridiculous. The briefcase isn't ours. Someone left it there. Yeah, and he hit us for no reason. Alright, alright, zip it. We'll deal with you later. There it is. Come here. Did you hit him? -Yes. I had to, I was alone. -You couldn't wait for us? No. I had an opportunity to get in here. No time to flush it down the toilet! Yeah, I get it. The boss is on his way. I told him downstairs that you'd already made a move. I reckon he'll be having a word with you. -What's the issue? -I don't know. He'll want to congratulate you. Come over here. Who's Snow White over here? Who's this? She was with them, but they say they don't know her. -What are you doing? -Frisking her. You never know. No, leave her, I'll handle it. I'll see her out. I'll wait for the boss downstairs. Put you coat on. We're just going to check your identity. Willie! No. Listen, stay here. Willie! I arrested them. I found more than a kilo on them. Bravo. I've had enough of you, Willie. We could have tailed them and found their provider in Paris. Do some real work. It was their last time in Paris. It was now or never. Really? So you were keeping information for yourself? -I'm not the only one. -Do you have any names? Anyone to snitch on? I didn't mean that. Everyone does it with informants. You know that. I do know. And with me, you work as a team and I promise even you will get this through your head eventually. You're not special, pal. I'm giving you one week's suspension. I'll be expecting your report. Oh, I forgot. Well done! You didn't kill anyone. Come on, this isn't fair! There were loads of them there, and armed. It was safer that way, damn it! For once we actually caught those scumbags red-handed. You think you're the only one doing their job right? -I never said that. -No, but that's what you think. Have you never asked yourself why your colleagues don't like you? Hey! What are you doing here? Nothing. Going home. Hi there. Can we buy you a drink? You hear that? We want to buy you a drink. Are you deaf? Hey, you can answer us. Be polite. We're being polite. We're not racist. We've done nothing wrong! Why are you acting like that? Hey, leave her alone! Whoah there, little midget, you going to stop us with those big arms of yours? I reckon so. Get lost. Do you take me for a idiot? What are you waiting for here? I've done nothing wrong. Leave me be. Who are you waiting for? And why in this street behind the hotel? Tell me… What do you want from me? Do you want me? What do you like? Here. Look. Touch. You can do anything to me, you know? Anything you want Anything. Anything you like. Let's go to your place. Have you got any food? It's four. We said three o'clock. What took you so long? The police turned up. Shit. Come on. Hey, René. -You look well. -Yeah. More or less. What's got into you, Willie? Oh, no! Not you as well. It'll all be fine, don't worry. Can you do me a favour? Can you find who this car belongs to and check if it matches the address? What are you looking for? I don't know. Maybe there's a link with the Marseille boys' provider. Who I supposedly lost. Have you told the others, or Roger? -No. I'm not sure enough. -You're at it again? For God's sake, make an effort. Trust us. Oh, please. Not another damn lecture! I'm old enough to know what to do. -It's René. Did I wake you? -No, it's fine. I've got your information. Yeah? And? The car belongs to the Charki brothers. The address matches up. It's some Lebanese guys, flush with cash and we don't know why. They must do a bit of everything, but we have no proof. Maybe you're weren't wrong. Goodnight, son. Thanks, René. Take care. Hurry up, Jo. Are you happy now? Don't bother. I've got it. Fuck, it hurts! This is a nightmare. The bullet didn't miss me. Thanks for that. -Fuck. -Where are we? In deep shit! I told you to go and bust them in Marseille! They're here. Now it's every man for himself! Hey, the Charkis did that to you? "Charki"? Never heard of them. You've lost it, man. Hey! Over here! I was the one who called you on his radio! Look! Look what he did to me! He's crazy! He's trying to force me to sell drugs. I'm clean now. Since I got out of prison, he hasn't left me alone. He follows me everywhere, selling what he steals! He's a dirty cop! Hold on, you shut your mouth! Take him to the hospital. Fuck! Gently. I'm in agony here! -You alright? -Yeah, I'm alright. Is that the Tunisian you took down last year? Yeah, it's him. He started again the second he was let out. What did he tell you on the phone? That you threatened to kill him, you fought, a shot was fired. He knocked you out. No! That's bullshit. Yeah, sure. Paul, search the car. -What's wrong with you? -Sorry, Willie. Just doing my job. You're not going to fall for this, are you? We don't know what you're up to. You never tell us anything. You have to trust us now, Willie. Tell us what's going on. How did you find out about the Marseille boys? And what happened to the black woman? OK. Thank you. They just removed the bullet. It's the same caliber. You're something else. Oh, hi. Everything alright, René? -Can I talk to him alone, Roger? -Yes, of course. I'll make a coffee. I fell into their trap, René. The Charkis. They've got the Tunisian. It was them who shot him in the arm. You should tell the chief. Yeah, right! He's looking to catch me out too. I've got nothing on them, nothing big. They'll just deny everything. Let me go. It's my only chance. Absolutely not. I can't be fooling around like you. René, don't abandon me. Not you. You're making it into a personal affair. That's not true. I just need 24 hours to get hold of a witness. Who? That girl you let go again? -You're doing this for her? -No. She's just a whore. But she's the only central link. If she talks… I'm sure I can get her to talk. Then, I can nab them all. Believe me. Let me go, René. Don't do this, Willie. Willie! If you want to leave, you'll have to hit me. I can't afford a big sanction. I really need that pension. Do it. Do it! Stop it. What are you waiting for? Do it. Do it. -You won't do it? -Cut it out, René. -Go on, do it. -Please, stop. -Do it, Willie! -Stop it! -Go on. -Stop it, please! That's your issue. You haven't had enough of those. Where is Jo? Don't know her. Is she still with the guy from last night? Yeah, she's still with him. Who is he? A rich guy. A big one. What are you doing with him? Nothing too bad. I bring him girls, that's all. I barely know him. I met him last winter at Courchevel. Start the car. Go on, Darmines, come to Beirut with us. Have some fun, be a little adventurous. I'd love to, but I'll be between two trips to the Middle East, and with Wagner still under wraps, no, it won't be possible. Every time, I need at least two weeks. "Two trips"? So that's it, you're nearly done. They gave you planning permission there? It's not impossible. Excuse me. What are you doing here? I'm looking for the girl you were with last evening. Will you tell me or would you prefer that I go tell your friends what you've been up to? What I've seen? -Alright, we're going in! -No! She's not here. She's in the countryside. Don't move! What are you doing? Nothing. Please be calm. I'll give you the keys. They're in my office. Follow me. I'll be with you in just a moment! Why the keys? She locked in there? Why? Huh? I didn't force her! She agreed to it. Right? Here. Villa Ivanna, Allée des Étangs, in Montfort-L'Amaury. -What's going on? -I don't know, Mr. Darmines. -Nothing serious, I think. -Get going! Don't move! Get under the trees. -What are you doing? -Go on, quickly! Get down there, get down. Put your head there, hurry. Your head there. It's your brother, I knew it. What are you plotting with Darmines? You weren't being honest last night. He's not just some john. -You're crazy! Did you see his face? -So why is your brother here? Who called him if it wasn't Darmines? Huh? Tell them not to move. Tell them to stay back. Get up. Jean-Pierre! Don't move! Let him carry on! Don't worry, Michel! We'll wait for you here. Keep going. Lock the door. Go on. Stop. Stop. OK, keep going. Up the stairs. Open the door. Oh, the bastard! What did he do to her? Why did he leave her like that? Go inside. Wake her up. Come on, baby. Jo! Wake up! The bitch won't wake up. Dress her and take her to the car. What are you going to do? What do you want with her? I want all of you. And you think you can catch us with her? With that? Never do that again. Carry her. Carry her! Do it! Jean-Pierre, show yourselves! He wants to see you! Start the car. Stop here and get out. Asshole! You asshole! Fuck you! You have to manage. Try. You have to walk on your own. We're going to a hotel. I can't. I'm too tired. No, don't worry. You'll get some rest, that's all. Come on, try and walk. That's it, Jo. There. There. You did it. That's good, Jo. That's really good. Are you feeling better? What happened? Where's Charki? Does he know I'm here? No. You know, it's through with Darmines. Is that so? That's good, right? What are the Charkis up to with him? I don't know. And the two guys from Marseille? So, what do we do? Are we fucking or can I go? You can't go. Did you tell them that you came to my place the other night? Yeah. Come here. Come, quickly. You're in a rush? You don't want them to worry? They don't give a shit about you, the Charkis. Darmines could do as he pleased with you. -They wouldn't have cared. -That's not true. You can't be serious. You were lying in a heap! You were his plaything! They gave or sold you to him, I don't know. Don't you get it? You were a mess! Like nothing! It was just for a few days, in exchange. In exchange for what? Let me go. No. Make love to me, then. Please. What's wrong? You don't want to? Please. Make love to me. You don't want to? Make love to me. Make love to me. Listen, just let me go. Why won't you let me go? I need you so I can take down the Charkis. You'll help me. Give me the key! Stop it. Stop. Stop! Stop. I'm not going to hurt you. Help me, Jo. It's your one chance to get out of this shit, same as me. Help me. You're hurting me. Jo. What should I do with you? Tell me. Please, tell me. What's wrong? What did you do? Did you call them? Did you call the Charkis? You told them we're here? Alright, we're going to the station. No funny business, pal. We're not in Beirut. Everyone stay calm. Get out, Jo. Don't move. Come on, Jo. Come on, baby. Get out, princess. Don't be scared. Come on, angel. Come on. You get it now? I'm sure you get it by now. I can't help it. It's because of her. I wanted her. That's all. For myself. It's been going on since last winter at Courchevel. They don't stop running after me, with her. It's intense with her. And she likes it. You can do anything to her. Anything. Anything. She likes it. She cries, then… it's even better. She makes you want her. Makes you need her. Doesn't she? She's like that, isn't she? Doesn't she make you need her? Make you want her? What they give her in exchange for? -Huh? -Money. No, no. I know it was an exchange. Come here. In exchange for what? In exchange for what? Weapons. What sort of weapons? Rocket launchers. For what? I don't want to know. Where do these weapons come from? From Lebanon, from Beirut. They told me where to buy them. Why you? They couldn't go back there. I often go on business. Do they have them yet? Not yet. They'll be arriving by boat, along with other goods. When? Soon. One or two days. Charki? Darmines. I have the goods. They arrived early but I can't keep anything at my place. 11 p.m. outside the garage? Alright. But you'll bring me back the girl, OK? I don't care. I want her. No bodyguard, just you two. 11 p.m. What's he doing here? -Come on, baby. -I'm not going with him. -Quit acting up. Come on! -No! Shit! Jean-Pierre! Come on! Calm down! Calm down, goddammit! Calm down! Come on, calm down. Calm down. What? What? No way! Calm down! -Michel! -No! Michel, I'm begging you. Please, I don't want to go. -Please, Michel. -Stop it. Please! Please, please. Do you need us to give you a hand with her? We'll put the launchers in the garage. -They're in the trunk? -Yes. Charki! Get on the ground! On your front! Quickly! All three of you! Hurry up! Don't look at me! Arms out, Charki! Spread your legs. Now. You're going down, Charki. You're going to pay, Eh? You're crazy, chump. You've got nothing on us. You're going to pay as well. OK? And you. Come here. Listen to me. It's her that I want. Nothing else. You understand? Are you crazy? What's wrong with you? You want to marry her? Try saying that again. Got something to say? I didn't hear you. I didn't hear you! Alright, alright, alright. Take her, fine. We're off the hook! Jo. What's your game here? Why do you act like this with me? You shouldn't act like that with me. Will you put on your music? Want to go for a drive? No. Not during the day. I want to go out this evening, dancing. No. We have to wait a bit longer. What are we waiting for? What are you waiting for? Where are we going now? You know where. To another hotel. And then? Then, we'll see. Just give me a minute, shit! Did you see? There's a club there. No way. I want to go right now. Or I'll leave while you're asleep. Didn't you get it the first time, you lousy little pimp? Get your girls off my strip! OK? We're straightening this out now! We need to teach him a lesson. Who do you think you are, huh? Watch out! There's someone up there! No! No! Calm down. Don't be scared. It's over. It's over now. That's it. Cry. Cry. Shit! Won't you beat it? No, hey, chill! Come on, Jo! Not a move until we're gone. Go on. Hit me. Don't be shy. I'm only good for that. I love you. I love you. You have to believe me. We'll get there. You'll get nowhere with me. This is who I am. The Charkis were right. No, that's not you. It's all because of them. It's me. It's me. Before them, I had nothing. It was worse. Without them, I'm nothing. If that's true, get out. Get out. Leave. Quickly. Go. Right now, go. Get out. You see? You see that it's not true. Now you have to tell me. Tell me what you want. -What are those? -Armored vans. For transporting money, and their itineraries. Gather round. Alright, I hope everyone has their coupon. -Yes, we've got them! -Jean! Guy! I left it in my jeans! -As usual! -You'll wait for me, right? He does this every time. Well, I guess we'll have to wait. It's too busy. We can't do it. Alright, hold on. He saw us. Whatever. This time, we're not letting him go. The next straight road, we'll get him. There. You're OK. Watch out, we're here. Jo! Jo! We'll go pick him up. Are you OK? I'm OK. You're not bringing anything? Don't do anything stupid, Willie. Trust me. I warned them as soon as you called. Either we do it this way, or in an hour, in a month, it's all over. You don't want that to happen. Nor does she. It's your only chance. We'll do everything we can. It's going to be OK. You'll be fine.
