- You know, Bob, I... I don't usually do this sort of thing. Go to motel rooms with strangers, I mean. But you seem kind of nice. Are you nice, Bob? - "Happiness lies only in that which excites, and the only thing that excites is crime." Do you know who said that? Well, let me give you a hint. He also said, "One must do violence to the object of one's desire. When it surrenders, the pleasure is greater." - You're scaring me, Bob. - Okay. Last chance. The eternal truths that bind all men together the whole world over: ‘We eat, we shit, we fornicate, we kill, and we die.” Give up? - Yes. - Well... I guess you'll never know. -Well, Bob, you were right about one thing. We all die. We'd like a room. - 65 dollar a night for a twin, 80 for a king. Waterbeds extra. Not from around here, are you? Anything fun to do around here, old man? - Well, there's a bar down the road a piece. Pretty girls. Sign here. Mr. and Mrs. Smith? You got room 112. Welcome to Redemption, Mrs. Smith. - Where you going, Walt? - Huh? - Don't play games with me, Walt. You got something on you? - Aw, yeah. Sorry. - A hand grenade, Walt? - One can't be too careful. You know. - All right! Welcome. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome one and all. Everybody bring some money to Teddy? Yes, sir. This is a big night here at Teddy Bears. Ladies and gentlemen, lets put your hands together. Fellas, let’s put your hands together for the one, the only, Miss Aurora Dawn! Come on, fellas! Give her a round of applause. Lets go! Come on, girl. There she is. Oh, yes. Yeah. - Hey, there, Fortune. - Yeah? - Go on and get me some ice. - Okay. You're new. - Mm-hmm. - When did you start? - Tonight. - Where are you from? - You're awful nosy. - I'm just curious. - You’re the bouncer? - Yeah. I work the door. - You’re not very big for a bouncer. - No, I guess I'm not. - Huh. - My name is Hazel Fortune. Everybody calls me Fortune. I didn't catch your name. - I didn't throw it. - Have you worked in a— - Look, Fortune, right? I'm not here to make friends. - If you two are finished jawing now, perhaps we could get some work done around here. Starla, lets go. You're on in two. - Okay. - Theres some people at the door now. - Well, good luck out there. - Oh, dear God. I'm a wretched sinner. Show me the way to goodness. - Can I get you something, hon? - I've never seen you before. Are you new here? - Yeah. - You're an angel. You're magnificent. - Look, you want a drink? - No, ma’am. What I’d really like would be to... see you alone somewhere. - Alone's gonna cost you. - I have money. - I'm not cheap. - You know who that is? - With Starla? No. - That's Enoch Pitt. - So...preacher man. Big old church and all. - All men have urges, Luther. Even preachers. - Yeah. You got that right, son. - time's up, hon. - No, pIease. Just a little longer. - It's your money. - You're so beautiful. - I said no touching. - I'm not touching. I just want to caress your aura. - All right, you know what? This show is over. - You are the flesh of Eve. - Let me go! - You do not belong here. - Let me go, or I'll scream! - No. Let me help you. All you need is a guiding hand. - Let go, you freak! Help! Help! Help! Help me! - Nothing personal, preacher, but you can’t touch the girls. - You dare to put your dirty hands on me? You ain't my judge. Only the Lord himself can judge me. - Yeah, well, that may be so, but I can still throw your ass out of here. - The hell you will. - A man of God with a switchblade? - Yes, sir. For the peacemakers, I come in peace. But for the vile and violent, I bring the Lord's sword of vengeance. - Why don’t you just give me that knife, preacher, and we can all go home? I don't think so. - My salvation's at the end of that blade? - Salvation at the last minute, business boy. But if I were you, I would say my prayers. - Well, then, I’m sorry to disappoint you, preacher, but I don't believe in God anymore. - Well, then you surely are going to hell. - Well, let's burn together. - You wouldn't. - I don't really give a shit how this plays out. You're just standing between me and another drink. - Our day will come again, my friend. And my vengeance will be swift and dark, like a thief in the night. - Thanks, Walt. You got to be kidding me. - Hey, Fortune. -You okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. - Anything I can get you? - I said that I'm fine. - Okay. - Who was that guy? - I don't know. - Enoch Pitt. I'd steer clear of him if I were you. - Why? - He beat a girl here once. Couple years ago. I don't know why Luther still lets him back in. - Oh, God, what an asshole. - He likes you, though. - Great. Great. Yeah, my life just keeps getting better and better. - She's out of your league. - What? - You need someone like me. Now, we were good together. - We were never really together. I was drunk. - You’re always drunk, Fortune. - Damn it! - Here. - Jeez. You scared the crap out of me, girl. But thanks. - Sure. - Help me, dear Lord, to be strong. Help me to resist. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. Show me a sign, dear Lord. Show me the way to everlasting life with her at my side. Hello? Is anybody there? Hello? Hello? - You know you have to go back. - I will. - Be careful. - I will. - Remember, destroy his heart... or take his head. - Yeah, yeah. I know. - So where do I find him? - Come on, come on, come on! Aurora was supposed to go on ten minutes ago. Anybody know where in the hell she is? - Probably went out for a smoke. - A smoke, a smoke. Fortune, go out back yonder and check for Aurora. And get me that damn ice l've been telling you about. Come on! You are so dead. - Fortune. - Sheriff. - Any idea who would have done a thing like this? - Old boyfriend? Anything? - None that I know of. - You really got to stop drinking that stuff, Hazel. Its just gonna kill you. - Yeah, 1m working on that. - Yeah. Well, look, if anything does turn up, you give me a call. - Yeah. - Think it's him? - Who, Hazel? No, no, he's just a harmless old drunk. - Hey, Rev. - Stop! Do not move, sir! Don't move! Don’t move, or I will shoot you, sir! -Oh, my God. Annie? This is Lucas. - Hey. - And, um, Melvin... um...hes just c— he’s covered in blood, and I-I-I shot the preacher. - What are you talking about? - Lucas? Lucas? Are you there? - What's his deal? - Whose deal, baby? - Fortune. - Hazel? You mean, besides the bottle? - He just... he seems so sad. - Life has dealt him a shit sandwich. That’s for sure. -Why is that? - You havent heard already? Jeez, baby. It's a damn soap opera. He used to be married. A long time ago. Normal life. I think some kind of salesman or something. He had a daughter too, like seven. One night, there was a car accident, mmm, a bad one. He walked away without a scratch. - So his daughter, she didnt. - Did she... Oh, my God. - Yeah, I know. - What about his wife? - Left him, I think. I don't know. He doesnt ever talk about it. - That's terrible. - Yeah. He's been drunk ever since. - Hey, Selma. You’re on in two. - All right, baby. That's me. - Thank you, dear Lord, for forgiving my sins and for bringing me back to life and for making me your instrument of destruction! - Shit! Shit, shit! - Everything okay? Everything is not okay. Everything sucks. My life sucks! - I was actually talking about your car. Is it okay? - Sorry. No. My car won't start. - Let me check it out. - Can you fix it? - Well, all the parts seem to be there. - Look, I can take care of it tomorrow for you it you like. - How am I gonna get home? - I can give you a ride. - No, thanks. - It's not a problem. - It's—it's okay. - It's really not a problem. - Do you mind? - Mind what? - Drinking and driving. I'd like to at least pretend that I might make it home okay. - Okay. You got a problem with drinking? - Yeah. Yeah, I've known a couple of alcoholics. I just don't like it. Hello? She left. God, you’ve got to be kidding me. Yeah, it's Mommy. I'm sorry I woke you up. Go back to sleep, okay? - Who's that man? - That is Fortune. - Fortune? Thats a funny name. - I know. Go back to sleep, okay? - Okay. - I love you. Night. Looks like the babysitter had a little party and just left. God, I’m gonna strangle that little bitch. - Can I help you? - No, it's all right. I got it. - How old is she? Your daughter. - She's ten. - She's very pretty. - Yeah. She's all I got. What am I gonna do now? I can't find a decent sitter for her during the day, and I have to work. I have two jobs. I have to work. - You work two jobs? - Yeah. You know the Quick-E-Mart over on Vine? - Yeah. - I make $6.50 an hour. But I’m saving up to go back to school, so... - Really? - Yeah, I don’t want to be a dancer the rest of my life. I mean, look at me. I'm 26 years old, and I'm a single mom with a ten-year-old. I mean, you go ahead. You do the math, and you tell me about my future. I mean, look at me, Fortune. My body is my résumé. - I can watch her. - What? - I can watch her for you. - I can't ask you to do that. - You're not asking me to. - Thank you. But... no. - Look. Just—you'd be doing me a favor. I just sit around and drink all day long anyway. - I can't afford to pay you anything. - I don't need any money. - I don't. I don't— I don't even know you. - You can trust me. Really. - You can't drink in front of her. Not even one drop. If I smell a drop on you... - I won’t drink. I won't. - Now, the good Lord has looked down upon his people, children. And He is not happy. No, not happy at all. He sees Sodomites and child murderers and other ungodly perversions that are destroying His people. And the Lord wants retribution. Holy retribution! I tell you, my friends, the day of the Lord is coming. And it will be a cruel day with wrath and fiery anger! And it will desolate the land and destroy all of the sinners within! Now... now, the Bible says that an anointed one will rise up from the grave and that this anointed one will restore the reign of God's kingdom here on Earth and will destroy all of Gods enemies! - Amen. - I tell you, my friends... my brothers. I am the anointed one! I am the one who liveth and was dead! Behold! Behold! Gather around me and put your hands on me and rejoice in the joy of the Lord! Behold! We have been chosen to be God's army in the Second Coming. Now, who will join me in holy baptism and become my first disciple? - I will. - Brave Billy Tobias. Are you ready to die and to be reborn and to give your soul to our Lord? - I am. - I am the resurrection and the life, and he who believeth in me will live forever, even though he dies. -Who's next?I - Fortune? Fortune? - Yeah, sweetie? - Mommy said that you had a little girl. - What? - Mommy said that you had a little girl. - Yes. - Where is she? - Shes in a better place, sweetie. - Where's that? - Heavenj -Oh. Do you miss her? - Every day, sweetie. I miss her every day. - What was she like? - Well... she was a really beautiful girl just like you. Why not? - Because your time, your time is coming soon, brother Silas. Very soon. But right now, I need you to protect our flock. When we sleep, we are most vulnerable. - All right. So what's the plan? - We are gonna cleanse this town of the wicked. Now, this is a war, a dark and profound holy war, and we must prepare for it. We must sharpen our swords, prepare our deadly weapons, and make ready our flaming arrows. - So we need more guns. - So let's knock over some gun stores. - Boy, you are such a dumbass. - All right, then. We rob a bank, and then we can buy all the guns we want. Just shut up before I— - Enough. Enough. I have a better idea. Let us pay the house of whoremongers and prostitutes a visit and let our night of holy terror begin. - When is Mommy coming home? - Not for a couple more hours. - Can I stay up a little longer? - Please, Fortune? - Can you tell me a story? One little story? Please? - What kind of story do you want to hear? - A scary story. - No, I don't know any of the scary stories. - Come on. A scary story. - Really scary? - Yeah. - Like crazy scary? - Maybe. - Okay. Let me see. Once upon a time, there was a little girl, and her name was Little Red Riding Hood. One day Little Red Riding Hood went to see her grandmother through a long, dark woods. What she didn't know was that her grandmother had already been visited by a big bad wolf. That wolf killed her grandmother and ate her. When Little Red Riding Hood got there, the wolf was still in the house. - Luther? Luther? - So the wolf pretended to be her grandmother, and Little Red Riding Hood went in the house. - Luther? Luther? - And she said to the wolf, "My, what big eyes you have, Granny.” And the wolf says, "The better to see you with." - Luther, are you okay? - And then she says to the wolf, My, what a big nose you have, Granny. And the wolf says, “The better to smell you with, my dear.’ - Luther? - Then she says to the wolf, "My, what big teeth you have, Granny." - Then what? - A big, strong hunter breaks into the house, kills the Big Bad Wolf, and saves Little Red Riding Hood. End of story. Good night. - Oh, Fortune. - Listen, really. You have to sleep now. - Okay. Fortune? Would you save me from the Big Bad Wolf? - Theres no such thing as a Big Bad Wolf, sweetie. - Yes, but if there was, would you? - Absolutely. - Good. - Good night. - Good night. Help. Help me. Somebody help me! Help! Help me! Let me out of here! - What'd you bring her here for? She ain't one of us. - That is none of your concern, Silas. Don't worry about it. - I do worry about it. It's my job to worry about it. I say we kill her now. - You need to calm down, brother. Put your trust in me and the Lord. - Was it the Lord's idea or yours? - What was that you said? - You heard me. That harlot has got your head turned the wrong way. Is she gonna be your personal— - If you ever, ever question my authority again, I will rip your tongue out and staple it to your forehead. Do you understand me, Silas? - I was just trying to get down to business is all. - And so you shall. So you shall. Is everything prepared for tonight? - Yep. - Good. Then tend to business. - Wheres Mommy? - I don't know. - When is she coming home? - I don't know, sweetie. Just eat your cereal. - Aah. Aah. Aah. Aah! Stop! - Yes, thank you. I'm just... What? Thank you. Well, Well, if you let me finish, I don't actually know that she's a missing person yet. Well... Why are you so rude? Well, thanks for nothing! They don’t know anything yet, sweetie. I'm sorry. - Shit! - What? Where'd you learn that kind of language? - You. - Oh, shit. - I'll tell you what, the club doesn’t open till 8:00. How about we just hang out here and drive over there later? - Okay. - It's gonna be okay. I promise you. - What's going on? Where am I? What did you do to me? - You have been transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit. - Transformed? Into what? - Yesterday, you were among the wicked. But today you walk with the righteous. - What are you talking about? - I have given you eternal life. - Eternal life? - You see, now you will never grow old. - You're crazy. - No, it’s true. It's true. You will live forever. We will live together forever. - You cannot keep me here forever. - It is ordained. You will be my queen in the Second Coming. Your place is here with me. - I have—I have a daughter. She's only ten years old, and she needs me. I have to go. - I have seen a picture of your daughter. She's beautiful just like you. But don't fear. I will bring her here. And we will all live together as one big happy family. I saved it for you. Do not worry. In time, you will understand. - You can't come in. Why not? - Cause they don't really let kids in there. So I need you to stay in here, okay? And I don't want you to move. Don’t leave the truck, all right? - Okay. Are you going to be long? It's kind of scary in here. - Well, just lock all— lock the doors. And just— I'll be right back, okay? - Okay. Fortune? Fortune, are you there? - Hello, Fortune. - Hey, Crystal. - Do you think I'm pretty? - What happened here tonight? - I’ve always loved you, Fortune. - What happened here, Crystal? - You turned me away. I can make you love me. Forever. You shot me. Fortune. Not half as sweet as yours is going to taste. - Is Mommy there? - Mommy! - Baby, come here. - I missed you. - I missed you too, honey. Where have you been? - Looking for you. Who’s this? - We're her new best friends. - Friends? - Yeah. You got a problem with that? - Not if she doesnt. - Why don’t you sit down for a while, be neighborly? - I don't think so. - Boy said, sit! - No, come here. -You better shut that girl up before I shut her up, okay? - I know. Be quiet, okay, just... - Come here. - What? - Come here. It's time. - time for what? - It's time to feed. - Feed? I don't... Pitt didnt tell you? Oh, that’s rich. -Tell me what? - You want to live, girl, you got to feed. - Starla. - No, Mommy! What are you doing? - What are you waiting for? Do it. Kill him.I - Mommy, no! - I can't. - Feed or die. Your choice. - Come here. Come here. It's going to be okay. - All right, enough of this. Let's go. - Oh, what about him? - Move it! - You and me are gonna have some fun. Now were gonna see what you're made of, inside and out. You ready? - Whoo-hoo! You're a dead man! You're a dead man! You hear me? - Who are you? - My names Daniel. - Well, Daniel, I suppose if you wanted to kill me, I'd already be dead. - What are you people, vampires? - That's one name. Some say it's a gift; others, it's a curse. - What do you want from me? - That preacher, he needs to be stopped. - What do you care? - Oh, I have my reasons. - Well, then kill him yourself. - Yeah, well, there's too many of them, and they have guns. - I thought guns couldn't hurt you people. - Oh, they can. A lot of things can. Decapitation, removal of the heart. I mean, if you destroy the organ, we die. - So just so I'm crystal clear here, you want me to help you kill an army of undead wackos armed with automatic weapons? - Yeah. - Well, how about you kiss my ass? Cause I don't give a shit. - He has the little girl. - What makes you think I give a rat's ass about her or anybody else? - She doesn't have anybody else. And over the years, I've become a very good judge of character. - Oh, yeah? Well, how about I killed my own daughter driving drunk one night? How's that judge of character? - You know, there’s not a big difference between the two of us. - How's that? - We're not really alive or dead. We're just caught in the middle. And as tough as life is, we just can't bring ourselves to choose death. - Maybe we're just weak. - Or maybe the will to live is too strong, but you... you have a choice. - Where's my daughter? - Do not worry. She's fine. - I want to see her. - All in good time. - I want to see her now. - You will see her when I say you can. I really do love your temper. You and me are going to have to come to an understanding. - What kind of understanding? - Now, I could have killed you. But instead I gave you immortality. You could at least be grateful. - Grateful? Grateful? You turned me into a monster. You kidnapped me, and you've taken my daughter. - Like it or not, we will be a family. - Never. - Brothers and sisters, our time has come. The wrath of the Lord Almighty is upon us. We will wage war against the ungodly and the wicked. And I tell you that the land will be scorched, and the people will be fuel for the fire, and the sword will devour until it has quenched its thirst with blood! - Shit! Fuck! Shit! - I have never had a way with words I have never been a patriarch. All I have is my story And one day I'll sell it all and go And maybe one day you can't make me golden Maybe I'll get stolen and buried at sea And someone will see that it is me. Oh, shit. Come on, quick. We have to go right now. - Okay, we just have to get Mommy. - We can't, honey. - We can't leave without Mommy. - Listen to me. We can't get Mommy, sweetie. We have to go right now. - I'm not leaving without Mommy! - Where's William? - Huh? - Where's William? He's not at his post. - I-I don't know. - You dumbass. I'm gonna kill him. - What? What's going on? - We got us an intruder. You stay here. - Sweetie, we have to go right now. We can't help Mommy, sweetie. We can't help her, honey. She's with them. -The bad men? - That's—that's right, sweetie. That's right. - But who's gonna take care of me? - I will. I promise you that. - Okay. I love you, Fortune. - I love you more, sweetie. Now, come on. Let's go. - All right, start checking each room. They didn't get past us, so they must still be up here. Start with the back bedroom. Check on the girl. - Shit! - Fortune. Whats the matter, sweetie? You want your mama? - All right, now. We're gonna let Pitt decide what to do. - When did you become Pitt's dog? - I ain't nobody's dog! - Then give me my five minutes with him. - All right, then. You take him down to the basement. We'll be down there in a little bit. Go on. - Now, come on. Let's go. Let's go. A little virgin. - Hope. Hope. Oh, my God. - Silas. What was all that commotion about? - There was an intruder, but we got him. - An intruder? - Yeah. We got it under control. Tobias took him to the basement. - Who was it? - It was that bouncer from the bar. - Really? - Yeah. - Splendid. I wish him to suffer. - Okay. - Jacob, take them down to the sanctuary. We'll be down in a moment. - Sanctuary? Sanctuary, why? What are you doing? - We're about to have ourselves a little baptism. - A baptism? - Yes. It is time that your beautiful daughter joined our family. - No. No. Please, do not do this. - Well, I'm afraid we must. Can't you see? It has to be this way. Take them away. Take them. Brother Silas, can I talk to you for a minute? - Yeah. - I've been looking forward to this. - I'm sure you have. How's your eye? - You're pretty funny for a dead man. Huh. - Go ahead. Do your worst. - Well, don't you worry about that. Zeke? - Yeah. - Come give me that jigsaw over there, would you? - A little arts and crafts? - I'm gonna cut the skin off his face for starters. - Yeah, okay. - Whoo! All right, Zeke, come on! Let's go. Let's do this. Zeke? Zeke? Zeke? - Nice timing. - Is the girl safe? - How many did you kill? - Well, actually, nobody yet. - That wasn’t the plan. - Well, the plan sucked! - Yeah? Well, then God help us. - You believe in God? - Yeah, it's about the only thing I do believe in. Two days ago, you probably didn’t believe in vampires. - Good point. Now I'm ready. - Honey, could you please stop pointing that at us? How old are you? - Eighteen. - Wow. You ever killed anybody before? - No, ma’am. - You don't really want to kill us, do you, Jacob? - You killed my boy. - Shoot him. - What? - Shoot him! - Shit! - You missed. It's my turn. -You all right? Yeah. - Look, we’re gonna get up, okay, Jacob? And we’re gonna walk out of here, okay? And you’re not going to shoot us, are you? Are you, Jacob? - Running away, are we? - He was just a boy! - He was a traitor. - You're a bastard! - Now, where you gonna run off to, Starla? Where you gonna hide without my protection? What, you think you're just gonna live a normal life, get yourself a job, join the PTA? That part of your life is over. We have been given a higher power, a higher purpose. And we will unite as a family in order to serve that purpose. - You are not going to lay a hand on my daughter. - Step aside. - You're gonna have to kill me first. - It doesn't have to come to that, does it? - You will see this is all for the best. I am the resurrection, the power, and the life! He who believeth in me will live forever! - Let her go. - Let her go, Pitt! - Put down your gun. - Let her go. - Put down your gun, or I will kill her. - Shut up! Now, lay down your weapon, or I will surely shoot her. - Okay. - Now, back away. I don't want to miss. You can't fight the will of God. - Who says God's on your side, preacher? - Everybody offers everlasting life, but only I deliver it. I will— - I hate sermons. You all right? - I don't know. It hurts. - Anything I can do? - You can look after my baby. Can you do that? - Yeah. - Hope. I want you to go with Fortune for a while. Okay? Just a little while. Just until Mommy gets better, okay? - But I don't want to leave you. - I know. God, I love you so much. You are so smart, and you are so beautiful. It's gonna—it's gonna seem like it's a long time, okay? - Mm-hmm. - But I'm gonna come for you. - Okay. - Okay. - I love you, Mommy. - I love you too. - You better get her out of here. -What about you? - I think I'll stay awhile. - Hope. Let's go, honey. - I love you, Mommy. - I love you too. I’m gonna see you soon, okay? - You know what else lives in this tree? Bats. Bats live in it. They come in, they fly, and then they eat all this fruit. And sometimes during the day, they sleep, and at night they go out. Hey, how'd you do on that math test? - Okay, I guess. - What do you mean, okay? We worked on that thing all weekend. - I got an A-minus. - A-minus? Thats awesome. - Can I stay up till 9:00? - Okay. - Yes. Fortune. - Yeah? - Do you think she's still out there? - Maybe. - Do you think she's okay? - Yeah. I think she is.
