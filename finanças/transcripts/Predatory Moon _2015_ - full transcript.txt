(dramatic instrumental music) (moves into ominous instrumental music) (sighs) Damn, that thing's heavy. Think Karla put enough ice in here? Well, you're the idiot that told her we were takin' the boy fishin'. Well, at least she packed some soda for him. Nah, give one of those beers to Ronnie. You sure about that, Dean? Hell, I was about his age when I had my first one. Go ahead. Go on, Ronnie, it's okay. I won't tell your mom. RONNIE: Um, thanks, Mr. Waters. (laughs) Don't worry about that. You'll get used to it. Just keep drinkin'. So why did you bring your nephew? DEAN: I had to. Ma's on that weekend trip with her church group, and Kim won't be back for him until Tuesday. Well, you better catch somethin' before I get back. DEAN: We will. When you get back? I'm headin' out now. The bitch hates it when I'm late. RONNIE: You're leavin' us out here? Uh huh. Didn't your Uncle Dean tell you you'd be walkin' home? He's just fuckin' with ya, Ronnie. Frank here has got himself a sweet little lady friend on the side that his wife don't know about. So, why are we here? Because Karla saw us leave with him, and she'll see us with him when he gets back. RONNIE: Oh, I get it. You're a right smart boy, aren't ya? Have fun babysittin'. (birds tweet) So how long will he be? Few hours. And we just sit here? Yep. Shouldn't we start fishing? Have yourself another beer. (twangy, jagged instrumental music) What the fuck? (percussive instrumental music) Oh yeah? Well bring it on, you crazy bitch. I'm telling you, he's not here! Now stop fucking calling me. (grunts angrily) (percussive instrumental music) Hey there, sexy. I know you're working the graveyard shift but I thought we could get together tomorrow at Mom's place. I'll be waiting. (twangy instrumental music) (gagging) Still pretty good for your first time. RONNIE: I feel really sick, Uncle Dean. Frank will be here soon, then we'll get you home and in bed. My dad had a friend who used to make moonshine. Fucking puked my guts everywhere when I first had it. But then he started mixing it with lemonade, and I have never puked since. Maybe we'll do that for you next time. That sound good? RONNIE: My stomach, it hurts real bad. Aw, come on, you didn't have that much. You had, what, maybe two? Tell you what, you stay here, I'll go to the road and see if I can get us a ride home, okay? (twangy instrumental music) (growling) (squishing) (ominous instrumental music) (moves into percussive, warlike instrumental music) (moves into twangy, peaceful instrumental music) (birds tweet) (peaceful instrumental music) FISHERMAN: Dean? Hey, buddy, you okay? (dean groans) DEAN: What? It's me, Cob. You get lost out here? DEAN: No, I, I don't know what the heck I'm doin' out here. You gotta ease up on that bottle. It'll be liable to. (dean groans) Oh my God. What happened to you? DEAN: I ran into somethin'? Yeah, you got caught on somethin' real bad. Probably one of those sharp branches. We better get ya to a doctor right away. No, no, we, uh, gotta go get Ronnie first. You brought the boy with you? Your sister's gonna have your hide if she smells any liquor on him. Where's he at? Um, down the road. Oh boy, come on. Let me get ya up here. (dean groans) All right. Oh my God. Ronnie? (suspenseful instrumental music) COB: Ronnie? You can come out now. We're gonna take you home to your grandma's. (suspenseful instrumental music) And you're sure you left him around here? DEAN: Yeah, see, there's our cooler right here. COB: All right, well, sit here a second. (dean grunts) Oh, look, there's his shoe. He's probably passed out over there somewhere. Ah, Dean. I'll go get him. (suspenseful instrumental music) Oh. Oh my God. Oh, Ronnie. (percussive instrumental music) Hello, Patty? Yeah, I need to talk to the sheriff right away. Yes, right away. (twangy instrumental music) Ah, no you don't. (giggling) Damn, how can you have so much energy comin' off the late shift? I sleep in the car. Bad guys don't mind. (chuckling) I think you're the baddest guy in town. Do you? (cellphone vibrates) If the sheriff's calling before noon then it's something important. The sheriff? But he's not even your boss. Yeah, well if I wanna finalize this transfer then he kinda is. Don't worry, I'll be runnin' things soon here. For now, I just gotta keep the old man happy. Well then, maybe I should just call someone else. I bet Robert's up, too. You know I'm just playing with you. (cellphone vibrates) I wouldn't. (cellphone vibrates) I gotta take this. Good morning, sir. No, I'm not at my house, I'm at. You're kiddin' me. (lushly staccato instrumental music) (sighs) You weren't kiddin' about how nasty this one is. Where in the hell you been? Patty's been tryin' to ring you at home all mornin'. I was with someone, Sheriff. You best get Patty that cell number of yours. Took me over 40 minutes to get out here. Would've taken you less than three. MAN: (in blue) Sorry, Sheriff. Just get to it. I'm sure you know the drill. (camera clicks) So what do you think? Gator? No. Definitely a bear. I've seen this kind of mess before up in the Rockies. SHERIFF: A bear attack in broad daylight? Hungry bear doesn't give a damn what time of day it is. All right, when you finish up with this, just (sighs) call the wagon to come get this poor kid. Yes, sir. Looks like Sheriff McKenny's comin' back over now. Just tell him everything you remember. This ain't your fault, Dean. Yeah, well fuckin' cops always find a way to blame me for everything. SHERIFF: Is that exactly how you found him, Cob? Yes, sir, Sheriff McKenny. And Dean here was a quarter mile down the path there. SHERIFF: All right. So what were you and your nephew doin' all the way out here? DEAN: We weren't doin' nothin' but drinkin'. Well how'd you get out here? 'Cause I haven't seen your car anywhere. DEAN: We walked. Cut the shit, Dean. Now that's your nephew all torn up under there. Least you can do is be straight with me on how he got that way. All right, Frank dropped us off, okay? SHERIFF: Frank Waters? Yeah. He just dropped you and Ronnie off and then took off. Yeah. Well that's pretty funny 'cause Karla Waters has been callin' the station all mornin' 'cause he didn't come home last night. Where did Mr. Waters go? I don't know. He said he had somethin' to do and then he'd be back for us later. All right, come on. Officer Ambrose. AMBROSE: Sir? I need you to wait on the coroner while I take Mr. Clout here to the hospital. I'm not goin' to the hospital. I gotta get home. Shit, Mama's comin' home today. Dean, you need to get yourself taken care of. You're pretty torn up. Yeah, I'm fine, it doesn't hurt. He may be goin' into shock, Sheriff. Officer Ambrose can go see your mama after the coroner gets here. You understand? Cob, can you go see to Ma? I can along with them, don't you worry about it. Best she hear about this from someone she knows. (pulsing instrumental music) Hi. Yeah, I'd like to get a rental in Springvale, Florida. A house, please. (trembling, melancholic instrumental music) I left another message for George again this morning. He won't return any of my calls. Christ, he doesn't even know. Maybe you should just tell his wife. No! I should be the one (sniffs) to tell him that Ronnie's gone. He needs to know, and if he won't answer your calls... It's our son for fuck's sake. He can't even talk to me for two goddamn minutes? The funeral is on Wednesday. He should be here. Why don't you let me call him? Ma, I'm just so, so Angry! It's all right. Let it out. Just let it all out. (weeping) (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) Hello? George? Oh, hi, Karla. I'm, I'm holdin' up okay. It's Karla again. No, he's still asleep. We haven't heard anything yet. (knocking) Dean? Dean, wake up, it's almost noon. (knocking) Dean, can you hear me? Yeah, I hear ya, Ma. MA: Dean, Frank's wife's on the phone. She's been calling all day. I'm not feelin' good. Tell her I'll see her Sunday. Yeah, I know, but you're just going to have to face the fact that he was, I mean, they didn't find his truck, right? Hold on a second, okay? Now, Karla, you listen to me. Dean just told me that he'd be along to see you on Sunday. You have got to stop pestering Kimberly. She has got bigger problems to worry about than your no-good husband. (phone slams) Ma! That was rude. You just lost your son and she's whining to you about how her husband run off on her? I think she's the one who needs to learn to mind her manners. (tolling instrumental music) I hope you didn't have any trouble findin' the place, Mr. Reading. Oh, not a problem. Are you Mrs. Wilson? (chuckles) I'm Shari. Mom owns this place. You seemed a bit young to be the woman I talked to on the phone. Mom doesn't drive much anymore, so she sent me out here to give you the grand tour. (keys jingle) And the keys to the manor. Do you get a lot of renters all the way out here? It's a big house so we usually rent it out for fishin' groups for the weekend. MR. READING: What about hunting? That, too. Lot of deer out here. You staying up here all by yourself? Uh, no, not really. Wife's bringin' the kids next week. Oh, Mom didn't say anything about that. Well, it's the perfect place for a family vacation. Let me show you around the house. Your mom mentioned a barn out back. Can I see it? (tolling instrumental music) I wouldn't call it a barn. I mean, it used to be, but now there's just a bunch of junk in there. And you do have to deal with ole Bessie here. MR. READING: Not a problem. Daddy was a junk man. I've been meanin' to clean this place out for years but haven't gotten the time. Looks like there's a little room left. You mind if I park some bikes in here for the kids? SHARI: Small keys will open it up. (twangy instrumental music) Frank, where the hell are you? Call me. Oh, Dean. I thought you were. DEAN: No one's seen him, Karla. I'm just so scared. After what happened to Ronnie. Frank didn't get eaten by a bear, honey. He left before we were attacked. I know. His truck is gone. The police think he just took off. But why would he do that to me? He had another woman on the side. Maybe he just, you know? I know all about that. He's fucking Shari Wilson. He was fucking Shari? He and half the town. But he didn't see her that night. I called her. Oh, like she'd tell you if she did. She was pretty pissed off about being stood up. I could tell that much, even if she wouldn't admit it. Did you tell the cops about this? Of course I did. They talked to her, too. (sighs) Those assholes think he's got another woman somewhere that no one knows about. All cops are assholes. Do you think maybe he found out about us? Maybe that's why he dumped you out in the woods before he left? (twangy instrumental music) I've seen a couple of bears over the last few years, but never this close to us. They usually stay out in Ocala. MR. READING: It's not unusual, Sheriff. Been a lot of towns troubled by all kinds of animals. The land gets developed, and the wildlife just have no place to go. Even had a bear in a suburb of Philadelphia last year. Hmm, nothin' been built around here. It's mostly just swampland. So there were two victims? Yep. One of our local hell-raisers brought his nephew out here. He was on the path here, and the boy was a little further down the woods there. Can I see the body? You don't wanna see that. That kid was 10 years old. Pretty much ripped in half. I've seen worse injuries like that. I'm sure you've seen a lot of stuff in your research and all, but this was really bad. Keeps me up at night. I'd also like to interview the survivor. Mr. Clout? Can you arrange that with the hospital? The hospital? Dean's not at the hospital. MR. READING: So he didn't survive? Yeah. He's back home. But the report said he was raked across the back. That'd cause excessive muscle damage and blood loss, even spinal trauma. That's the queer thing. When Mr. Hill found him, he was a real mess, but when the hospital cut his shirt off, it didn't seem too bad. (eerie instrumental music) Officer Ambrose, we're gettin' on back to town now. Yeah, I'm comin', Sheriff. (staccato instrumental music) SHERIFF: I told you you wouldn't find anything that close to the street. Didn't hurt to check. MR. READING: What's he looking for? Ah, we had another fella go missin' up here that day. MR. READING: So you think you have another victim? Not unless that bear knows how to drive a truck. What's he think? Well, Officer Ambrose transferred from Tampa last year. Still treats everything like a big city crime scene. (birds tweet) (percussive instrumental music) Shit! (percussive instrumental music) (sighs) Okay. (droning instrumental music) Mrs. Clout? My name is Kyle Reading. I'm with the Wildlife Research Center. I was wondering if it would be possible if I could speak to your son. He's not? Oh. I know it's a bad time, but. You don't mind? I appreciate that, Mrs. Clout, and I'm sorry for your loss. I'll see you then. Bye. (busy instrumental music) (moves into droning, funereal instrumental music) COB: Louise. Jacob. I'm trying. (Jacob whispers) Thank you, Jacob. Thank you so much. (funereal instrumental music) Ellen brought some of that potato salad you like so much. Kim, you've got to eat something. I know you don't want to, but. Is George still here? (Louise sighs) He's in the kitchen with Pastor Nichols. You just stay here and eat, and he'll be gone soon. I need to go get a fork. No! You need to stay right here and eat. Dean. Yeah, Ma? LOUISE: Go in the kitchen and get a fork for your sister. DEAN: Okay, sure. I think I'm gonna go back home tonight. LOUISE: Are you sure? It's an awfully long drive. Maybe you oughta stay here tonight and get some rest and leave in the morning. Ma, I just... (shattering) You son of a bitch! You killed my son. You goddamned son of a bitch! What the fuck were you thinking taking him out there? George, stop it, it's not his fault. Not his fault, not his fault? George, perhaps you should sit down. He took my son out in the middle of fucking nowhere, for what? To be his drinking buddy? And you, you let him? Mother of the fucking year! I didn't know! How was I supposed to know? Louise, could you take Kimberly? I left him here while I was out with Sylvie. I didn't know Dean was gonna take him out. GEORGE: You left him here with your drunk-ass brother while you went out partyin' with your friends? Please, George, there's no need for all this shouting. You need to calm down now. I'm okay, Padre, really. I just wanna know what this stupid bitch was thinking! George! GEORGE: How the fuck did you ever get custody? Ma was here. How was I supposed to know? GEORGE: You left my son with a worthless piece of shit and a senile old lady? And now he's dead because of you. Cunt! I should fucking kill you! SHERIFF: George, let's go outside. Settle down. Let's go outside. Yeah, get me far away from this stupid cunt. Come on, outside. (tinkling instrumental music) AMBROSE: Mr. Reading. I thought everyone in town would be at the funeral by now. So did I, Officer. So what are you doin' out here? Lookin' for your bears? Yeah. Just wanderin' the scene. Tryin' to understand what happened here. Well, I think it's kind of obvious what happened here. Dean takes his nephew out in the forest, they go stompin' around all over the place, somethin' decides to join the party. Sure seems that way. (rustling) Did you need somethin' from me, Officer? Oh, no. Fastest abandoned vehicle case I've ever had to solve. You have a good evening, Mr. Reading. KYLE: Officer. How'd you get here? Well, I live right over there. It's kinda hard to miss the car that's parked in your backyard. (birds tweet) (somber instrumental music) GEORGE: Where did it happen? We found him on the fishin' path, not far from where you used to live. It's nice up there at least. You know, we lived there all those years, and I never did take Ronnie fishing. I should've fought harder to keep him, Boris. I shouldn't have let that bitch win! George. It's just that Karen, my wife, didn't want another kid in the house. You know, she has two girls. I thought Ronnie would be okay with his mother. BORIS: You wanna go to Leon's and have a couple beers? I have a long drive home. (dramatic instrumental music) Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please. Please. (crunching) (somber instrumental music) (moves into jagged instrumental music) (knocking) (gagging) (knocking) LOUISE: Dean, the police are here. They wanna talk to you. I ain't talkin' to them. Dean, you best get yourself out here. They wanna talk to you about Frank. Just give me a minute, Ma. He'll be out in a minute. Can I get you some coffee? No, we hate to come out here and pester you like this, Louise, but you know how it is. LOUISE: Now, Boris, you know I've missed seeing you regular since Alvin passed. Who's Alvin? Alvin was my husband, God rest his soul. Boris used to find him wanderin' in the middle of the day, and he'd always bring him straight on home to me. He liked his drink a little earlier than most people, you know. That he did. But he was lucky to have such a good woman to take care of him. As do you. Now how has Janice been? I didn't see her at the funeral. She's fine, she's just out in Texas visitin' with her sister for a little while. No problems at home, I hope. No, nothin' like that. Her sister's just gettin' ready to have another baby. So, what do the bastards in blue want this time? LOUISE: Dean! Well, I already told 'em everything I know, Ma. Mr. Clout, can you step outside with us? Ooh, I'm Mr. Clout now. I must've done somethin' real serious this time. No, I just think we've kept your mother away from her shows long enough now. Do you mind? DEAN: Yeah, I mind. Just spit it out. What do you want? I am so sorry, Sheriff. Dean's just been a little cranky, well, since. It's okay. I just wanna ask your son if he knows of anyone that Frank might've been seein' down at Fort Myers. Fort Myers? Why would anyone wanna go to that shit-hole? That's what we wanna know. The Highway Patrol found his truck down there this mornin'. That asshole ditched me to go to Fort Myers? Found his truck in the parking lot near the train station. He didn't buy any tickets in the last two weeks. We're wonderin' if maybe you know who did. Huh? Officer Ambrose. You know who he's been seein'? Well, I heard he was bangin' Shari Wilson. Wrong answer. She's accounted for. Try again. Then I don't know of anyone else. Are you sure about that? I mean, you two are joined at the head. You'd have to know who else he's seein'. Well, I don't know what he had for breakfast that mornin', either. I guess we weren't as good of friends as you thought. Dean, are you sure you don't know anything? Really, Ma, I have no idea. I was just his cover story. He'd drop me off somewhere and then go visit Shari and... He wasn't with Shari. Then whoever he was seeing. Anyway, he'd come pick me up before going home so Karla would think I was with him the whole time. Honest. AMBROSE: So, that's why you were in the forest with him? That's all you were, some sort of cover story for your buddy? I just told you, I wasn't his buddy. He wanted people to think that I was. BORIS: So why'd you go along with it. Well, we'd stop at the liquor store first. (Louise sighs) (ambrose laughs) You're pathetic. Yeah? Yeah. Well some of us don't make those big paychecks like cops do, fuckwad! Dean, that is enough. I'm outta here. LOUISE: Dean, Mr. Reading will be here soon. DEAN: Well he can blow me, too. I am so sorry. Dean's just been stressed lately. BORIS: It's okay, Louise. I'm gettin' ready to go over to Mr. Reading's now. Would you like for me to see if he can postpone his visit with you? No, that's all right. I'm sure Dean will be back soon. All right. So how do you know he wasn't with Shari Wilson? I talked to her. She's probably the best witness that we've got. I mean, is that guy ever sober? Not often. He gets that from his daddy. I could smell it on him. Just about made me sick. I want you to out to the Reserve today. See if they've seen any bears around there lately. AMBROSE: Can I take the cruiser? It's still in the shop. Yeah, well I'm sendin' you my gas receipts. If I'm payin' for your gas, you go straight there and back. No detours at Shari Wilson's. (pounding rock music) (grunting) AMBROSE: Yeah. Oh. (pounding rock music) Ow! Damn it! This isn't working for me, Joey. Oh, what are you doin'? There's just not enough room in here, I. The fucking steering wheel. Why can't we just go back to your place? We can't. The sheriff gave me a chore to do. If he sees my truck at my place, he'll have a fit. Why would he be going all the way out to your house today? He's there to see your tenant. He's going over to see Mr. Reading? Why? Probably gonna warn the poor guy of what a drunk Dean Clout is gonna be for his interview. What kind of interview? Why would anyone wanna hire someone like Dean? Damn it, Shari. Doesn't your mother check up on any of her renters? He's the special investigator here for the bear attacks. SHARI: So, he's going over to see Dean today? Yeah. And I'm headin' out to the Reserve. You wanna come with me? Maybe we can check out one of those cabins? Actually, I promised Mom I'd do laundry for her this afternoon. You know Mom. I'll never hear the end of it if I don't. (gentle instrumental music) Stupid son of a bitch. DEAN: Well, at least now you know he's alive. Yeah, he's probably livin' it up and laughin' about how he stuck it to me. That was a pretty shitty thing to do. You want a drink? I'll have a beer. I still have some whiskey left. You want that? DEAN: No, just a beer. (dean grunts) You feelin' okay, honey? Yeah, it's just been a while since I had one of those. I forgot how bitter it tastes. So, um, when you movin' in? Moving in, me? Well, yeah, I can't afford to keep this place by myself. And I can? You can get a job, can't you? (dean chuckles) I'm serious. Yeah, I think you are. But I can't. What do you mean you can't get a job? You're not a fucking cripple. I mean, I can't just move in with you. And why not? Your husband disappears without saying a fucking word to anyone, and then I move in two weeks later? How's that gonna look? I don't give a shit how it looks. Well then, how's it gonna look to the cops who are just itching to throw my ass in a cell, hmm? We need to stay off the radar for a little bit, baby. For how long? I don't know, a couple months, at least. Hey, do you think Frank told anyone? I mean, when he found out about us. No. We would've heard if he had had. (pulsing instrumental music) So Ronald was your grandson? Yes. We were looking after him while Kim went on a trip with some old friends form school. It's hard on her being a single parent, you know? She just needed a little break. I understand. Don't we all? Now, your daughter's still here? No. She had a terrible fight with her ex-husband at the funeral. She's gone back up to Mobile. And he lives here in town? No. He's over in Lauderdale, I think. He's remarried. Do you know when your son's coming back? I told him you were coming. He must've just lost track of time. I really need to talk to him. (sighs) Maybe I can help. The sheriff is an old friend of mine. He didn't hold back any of the details on me. I can't expect you to wanna talk about it. This research you're doing, it's to save lives, right? Trying to figure out what causes the attacks? Yes. I don't want anyone else to suffer like my grandson did. He was alive for most of it, you know? Can you imagine how terrible? Yes. I know. (Louise weeps) (rhythmic instrumental music) You must be pretty lonely up here all by yourself, Mr. Reading. (giggles) (ominous instrumental music) Oh my God. What took you so long? I've been scared to death that he'd come back before you got here. JOEY: What are ya doin'? I, uh, the washin' machine's broken at the house and I figured since he's right next door. It's okay, sweetheart. Now are you sure it's his cap in there? Of course I'm sure. Frank wore that hat all the time. Lots of guys wear hats, Shari. SHARI: Go in and see for yourself. It's on the dresser. On the dresser? In the bedroom? Yes, and it's all covered in blood! Just stay there and keep an eye out for him. Just stay there! SHARI: Hurry! (ominous instrumental music) (moves into strumming instrumental music) (moves into foreboding instrumental music) What have we been up to, Mr. Reading? (chuckles) (foreboding instrumental music) (moves into solemn instrumental music) SHARI: Did you see it? Yeah. You might wanna get dressed before someone sees you. Are you gonna call the station? You didn't call them already? No. I wanted you to be the one to come out here so you'd be the hero. Good girl. (Shari sighs) (sinister instrumental music) Fucking whore. (squishing) (Shari moans) (squishing) (droning instrumental music) (birds tweet) (somber instrumental music) Actually, they're very timid, so I don't think she has anything to be concerned about. Well that's a relief. Ellen is worried sick about catching rabies. Some people have bats in their attic and they never even know it. Why the fuck are you still here? You should've been gone by now. LOUISE: Where have you been? We have been waiting for you for hours. I know. He should've given up waitin'. (chuckles) I am so sorry, Mr. Reading. I have never seen him this bad before. Why don't I go have a talk with him? LOUISE: I don't know if he's in any condition. I think he's coherent enough to hear what I have to tell him. (knocking) What the fuck are you doin' here? KYLE: Dean, I need you to listen to me. Go fuck yourself. Cut it out, Dean. You didn't drink that much tonight. I bet you're not even drinkin' the hard stuff anymore. DEAN: You don't know. I know what you're going through. You don't know shit. I know you've been a cranky little boy lately. Your mother told me that much. Get the fuck outta here. And I know you walked away from somethin' that tore your nephew in half. Are you deaf or somethin'? And, as sure as I'm here, all this guilt you're feeling is nothing compared to what's in store for you if you don't listen to what I have to say. What do you want from me? KYLE: I want you to come with me. Why would I do that? KYLE: Because I know how to control it. Control it? What are you, from AA or something? Dean, the animal that attacked you has a disease, and it has infected you. I ain't got no diseases. Everything's fine. The doctors can't even believe how fine I am. I know. It just hasn't matured yet. But you do have all the symptoms. Symptoms. There is the increased irritability and anxiety, wild mood shifts, short spells of feelin' disoriented, restlessness, heavy sweating. So, it's called alcoholism. And then there's the accelerated metabolism, the hyperactive immune system. You're probably experiencing a higher tolerance of pain, too. I bet you're even horny as a jackrabbit now. Shit, are you comin' on to me? You're one of them fags, ain't ya? You're definitely not my type. Just get the fuck outta here. You just let my words sink into that thick skull of yours. We'll talk again. Don't count on it, faggot. (brooding instrumental music) (moves into twangy instrumental music) (eggs sizzle) (loud sizzling) (dean groans) (eggs sizzle) DEAN: Damn it, Mom, will you shut up these damn eggs? What are you doing? Are you all right? Let me get you a towel. Dean, where are you going? (eggs sizzle) DEAN: What the fuck is wrong with me? (droning instrumental music) (moves into quiet instrumental music) Hello? (quiet instrumental music) Well, just come on in and make yourself at home. Okay, you were right. Some really weird shit's been going on lately. What's happening to me? Your body chemistry is changing. Yeah, I got that. I have a disease or something, but what is it? It's hard to explain. That thing that attacked you, it left a little bit of itself inside of you. That's what's causing this to happen. But what is happening? You're turning into it, and you don't have much time. DEAN: It, what the hell is it? I don't know exactly. I've never seen it. Fuckin' knew it. You don't know shit about this! KYLE: I know right now everyone around you is in danger. In danger of what, me? Is this thing contagious? It's very contagious, and almost always fatal. Just because you survived doesn't mean you're lucky. You need to isolate yourself from everyone. You won't have any control left when it peaks. That's why ya have to plan for it. DEAN: But how the fuck do you plan for a disease? It peaks every 28 days. It's on a lunar cycle. DEAN: What? You feel it start to take hold for a couple of weeks, and then it blows up on days when there's a full moon. DEAN: Wait, you're tellin' me that I'm turnin' into a werewolf, is that it? I suppose you could call it that. (dean laughs) Ah, you gotta be shittin' me, man. You really had me goin' there. Dean, if you don't lock yourself up, you're gonna kill someone. Wait. It's not gonna be pretty. DEAN: You're serious, aren't you? I can help. Oh, man, you're the one who needs help, buddy. Do you even realize how batshit that sounds? Dean, if you're not gonna give yourself, at least send your mother away. Oh, you're good, send me mother away. Can we put her on a rocket ship to Mars while I turn into a werewolf? When you change, you're not gonna stop until you eat something that smells good to you, and that's gonna be the first person you see. There are a lot of good retirement communities in the city. You know, you really are out of your fuckin' mind. You just stay the hell away from us, understand? Dean, I'm just... If I see you again, I'm gonna kick your ass. (staccato instrumental music) No one's heard from Shari in almost a week, Karla, and your name keeps comin' up in conversation, a lot. Now, I heard you threatened her after your husband left. I didn't threaten her. All I did was call and ask if Frank was with her. She's the one that got all angry. BORIS: How do you mean? Look, I'm not the only one the bastard skipped out on. The only difference is, she's got other guys to fall back on. Can you give me some names? Grab a phone book, Sheriff. Karla, I need to know of everyone she's been seein'. Well, let's see. There's, uh, Pete at the hardware store. The grill cook from the Dockside. What's his name? Rob, I think. Uh, oh, your new pet Joey. And that guy with the weird bald spot on his head. You know, the one over on Mayland. And that's it? I don't know. I heard she was hitting on Ryan Darby over the 4th of July weekend. Oh, wait, and there was that guy that she's been seeing in my AA meeting, too. BORIS: Okay. Well, uh, what's his name? I don't know. I mean, it's anonymous. I'm just sayin'. She's probably fuckin' the guy that's rentin' her mom's place, too. (sighs) Okay. If you think of anyone else, just give me a call, please. KARLA: Sure. And I'm gonna need your new address after you get moved. I'll, uh, be stayin' at the Reserve until somethin' better comes along. (sighs) At the campgrounds? Yeah, my old man's a ranger up there. He's got her set up in one of our best cabins. Yeah. Cheaper than a hotel with, uh, out all the luxury. (shimmering instrumental music) (saw grinds) (cracking) (insects chirp) (peaceful instrumental music) You're runnin' out of time, Dean. Just look at the moon tonight. Get the fuck outta here. I told you, I'm not listening to anymore of your howling at the moon bullshit. KYLE: The virus runs on a 28-day cycle, so the moon is a good gauge, give or take a day. It's quite natural, given a woman's cycle is 28 days. Not to mention... You don't know when to quit, do you? I've got a place you can go. I can help you get through this. Do you even realize how fucked up that sounds? KYLE: At least get your mother outta here. Not happening. Now get the hell outta here. I'm not warning you again! (fleshy thunk) I don't want anyone to get hurt. Just get out of here, you fuckin' psycho. (birds tweet) Can I do something for you, Officer? I just wanted to make sure you got home all right. I hear there are monsters lurking about. (birds tweet) Shit. (insects chirrup) Where are you going, Kyle Reading? Or is it Jackson Verrel? Naw, it couldn't be Jackson Verrel. He's been dead for the last two years. Maybe it's Daniel Yates, wanted for murder in Ohio. Or, who is that? Bryan Ospen? Broke out of jail after keepin' a young lady trapped in his basement. You're a difficult son of a bitch to keep track of, but you know what? Lucky thing I got a buddy in Tampa who's a pro at lifting prints. (birds tweet) You know, Shari told me that you said you were a family man. I don't seem to see any kids around here with you. I had a family. Oh, I'm sure you did. Or maybe it was Vince Edgemont. Dead family. (chuckles) Yeah, well, I'm guessin' that you probably told her that just to keep that slut out of your way here. Don't you worry, she won't be bothering you anymore. KYLE: I just called the sheriff. He's on his way here now. No. No, you didn't. You don't wanna spend any time waitin' in our comfy little holding cell. I didn't kill her. Oh, I'm sure you did not. But you know what? Who do you think ole Boris is gonna listen to? His trusty sidekick, or some name-changing wacko fugitive with werewolves on the brain. What do you want? What do I want? I just wanna have a little fun, you know? (chuckles) Yeah, I kinda screwed up last month a little bit, thought I was gonna have to transfer. Again. But, you know, can you imagine how happy I am to find someone like you who I can just pin everything on. Yeah. Now look, if you wanna take a swing at me. (chuckles) Yeah. Tell you what, you stick around as long as you need to to finish up that little bear attack story. I promise you, though, everything's going to go right back to normal around here. Just as soon as you leave. (birds tweet) (quiet instrumental music) Mail's in, Ma. Thank you. Would you please call in the prescription for my sleeping pills? I only have a few left. DEAN: Yeah, sure. You might wanna think about taking some tonight, too. You look like a raccoon with those bags under your eyes. (quiet instrumental music) Dean, what's this all about? (quiet instrumental music) Dean, what the hell is this? I found that in this! Do you think you can kick me out of my own home? No, Ma, I don't even know what... Don't you pull that innocence crap on me. You think you can ship me off and move that woman in here. You think that that tramp that you've been sneakin' off to see at night is gonna take care of you? Huh, she can't even keep her own house, which costs a hell of a lot less to maintain than this house, boy. Stop it, Ma. I'm warning you. You're warning me? I am warning you. I have had it up to here with your slummin' around and your drinkin'! If you think you're gonna ship me off to some godforsaken nursing home. Shut up, you stupid bitch! I haven't had a drink in three fucking days! Just leave me alone, Ma. Dean, what is wrong with you? It's just the DTs, Ma. Don't worry about it. (tense instrumental music) I wish I knew more, but, honestly, I haven't seen her since that first day. I'm sorry to keep pesterin' you all the time. I, I know you're busy with your research and all. No problem, really, Sheriff. I'm glad you called. Seems like the whole town's been goin' crazy ever since that kid got killed. I mean, Frank's ran off on his wife, and now it looks like Shari's ran off, too. To top it off, I got a phone call from Kimberly Clout tellin' me that Dean went and beat up his mother the other day. Is Mrs. Clout all right? Yeah, she's okay. Always been a tough little lady. Of course, she won't press charges, and now I'm startin' to think Officer Ambrose is hittin' the bottle, too. It's just been a madhouse around here. Do you wanna sit down, Sheriff? No. I don't mean to be unloadin' all this on ya. Need to get back over to the station, make sure my secretary hasn't ran off, too. Must be hard bein' a sheriff in such a small town, huh? You know, for 28 years, it's been a piece of cake. Hell, people don't ever lock their doors around here. I guess it all had to catch up sometime. (brooding instrumental music) (tapping) (tapping) (tapping) (dean panting) What the fuck? (insects and frogs chirp) You just don't know when to fucking quit, do you? Do you know what someone goes through when they're being eaten alive? No, not this shit again. They feel everything. Knives piercing their flesh over and over again. Some doctors say they go into shock after a minute, but they can still hear their bones breaking. They can still smell the blood, piss, and shit as it pours out of them. Leave me the fuck alone. I don't want your mother to go through that. Do you? I will beat the living shit out of you if you don't get off my property right now. I just wanted you to know that. (frogs and insects chirping) (ominous instrumental music) I'm sorry. It's best you go this way. (dark instrumental music) (moves into pulsing instrumental music) (knocking) PARAMEDIC: (on right) Hey, Sheriff, where we goin'? Her bedroom's back there. PARAMEDIC: (on right) All right. (pulsing instrumental music) BORIS: I'm really sorry for your loss, Dean. Louise was a good woman. I should've been here. Maybe I would've heard her calling. You couldn't have know. She died in her sleep. Where were you last night, Dean? Are you actually accusing me of something? No, no, no, no. I'm just sayin' a man who beats up on his mama, goes out in the middle of the night same night she died, sounds a little fishy, that's all. Look, I don't think Dean had anything to do with this. Things like this happen. It's nobody's fault. I just went for a fucking drive to clear my head! I haven't been sleeping well, okay? Sheriff. Can I speak to you for a minute? (dean sighs) It's okay, Dean, it's okay. Is that keepin' ya up at night, tryin' to figure out who you wanna hurt next? I just gave up drinking, okay? Hasn't exactly been easy for me. Dean, they're gettin' ready to take her out now. You want me to call your sister? (sighs) Yes. Thank you. All right. Officer Ambrose. Sir? You can go ahead and head on it, and, uh, I'll take it form here. All right. Dean, I'm very sorry for your loss. Asshole. (pulsing instrumental music) (knocking) KIMBERLY: Dean! Let me in! (knocking) Christ. What is wrong with you? (insects chirp) (discordant instrumental music) Leaving so soon? Officer Ambrose. I just wanted to let you know that Kimberly Clout was in town to bury her mother. You know, since you been payin' such close attention to Dean. What's that to me? Oh, I thought you'd wanna off her, too. You know, to keep her brother from eating her tomorrow night. Yeah. I know you're kinda crazy. You really believe that werewolf bullshit. (laughs) Hey, I was happy to see you over at the Clout house the other night. Once the, uh, autopsy report comes in, we're probably gonna talk to Dean, but I'm guessin' he'll have a lot to say about you wantin' to save poor old Louise before the full moon. Hey, I got an idea. Why don't you bring Kimberly out here. You and me could both have some fun with her, huh? I think her husband doesn't like her. We could probably pin it on him. (birds tweet) (brooding instrumental music) (knocking) KIMBERLY: Yes? Is Dean here? KIMBERLY: Dean doesn't live here anymore. What? I kicked his ass out last night after he gave me this warm welcome. I'm sorry, but I really need to talk to him. Do you know where he went? Probably to a bar. KYLE: Well, when he gets back... I told him he's never stepping foot in this house again. I even had Sheriff McKenny escort him off the property. He's not coming back. (dirge-like instrumental music) (moves into sinuous, percussive instrumental music) (bird cries) (foreboding instrumental music) (grunting) (foreboding instrumental music) (knocking) Mr. Reading? It's Kimberly Clout. (foreboding instrumental music) (grunting) (squishing) Mr. Reading? (tense instrumental music) (cracking and squishing) (tense instrumental music) (cracking and squishing) (tense instrumental music) (cracking and squishing) (tense instrumental music) Mr. Reading? (tense instrumental music) Is that you? (cracking and squishing) Mr. Reading? (growling) Mr. Reading, are you in there? (growling) (cracking) (growling) Mr. Reading? Are you okay? (pulsing instrumental music) (cracking and squishing) (pulsing instrumental music) Mr. Reading, is everything all right? (cracking) (pulsing instrumental music) Mr. Reading? (pulsing instrumental music)) Ow! (grunting) (pulsing instrumental music) (Kimberly groans and whimpers) (Kimberly shouts) (squishing) (Kimberly whimpers) (pulsing instrumental music) (squishing) (droning instrumental music) (crunching) (growling) (percussive instrumental music) (growling) (percussive instrumental music) (growling) (droning instrumental music) (growling) (dramatic instrumental music) (roaring) (growling) (quiet instrumental music) Damn. (quiet instrumental music) (moves into tense instrumental music) (knocking) Dean? Are you all right? (tense instrumental music) Dean. What happened to me? Just what I told you would happen. You ate the first thing that smelled good to you after you changed. But I don't remember anything. I know. It took me a long time to figure it out. How did you know? I'd been sick for a couple of weeks. I thought it was just the flu. Until I woke up with my wife's arm next to me on the floor. DEAN: This can't be happening. I woke up next to a lot of bodies, until I saw the pattern. But I know how to distract it now. I'm just sorry I didn't find you in time. Please help me. I can't live like this anymore. No. No one should have to live like this. (buzzing instrumental music) (gun bangs) (buzzing instrumental music) (gun pops) (buzzing instrumental music) (moves into twangy instrumental music) Bella? (knocking) Jenny in there with you? (knocking) Come on, you guys were up all night again, weren't you? Come on! It's after two. (gagging) (splashing) (coughing) Don't move. Don't move! Look, I'm gonna get help. I'm gonna get help. KARLA: No. (brooding instrumental music) (knocking) Come in. I thought you might like some fresh towels, Mr. Johnson. Is there anything else I can do for you? Thank you, Mrs. Potter, everything's fine. I'm very comfortable. All right. I'll just set these towels right there for you, then. Oh, I see you've been reading about that crazy woman in Florida. Crazy woman? Yeah, it's all over the news this morning. She claims that a monster broke into her cabin, ate her landlord, and shot her boyfriend. Ate her landlord? Yeah, can you imagine that? Who knows what kind of drugs she's been on. And she looked terrible, all scratched up and all. Let me know if I can get you anything else, Mr. Johnson. (tolling instrumental music) Patty, get me the wagon out here. Yeah. There are three victims here. We've got Kimberly Clout, (sighs) and Officer Joey Ambrose is here, too. And I can't identify the rest of this body, but we can presume Mr. Reading is dead also. And get the Florida Wildlife Commission on the phone and see if they have any idea how we can bag this rogue bear we've got. ("Predatory moon/sinister initiation" by damn thy name) (moves into twangy instrumental music) What the fuck? Ambrose. Dude, you don't get naked out in the woods. There's a, there's a guy playin' a banjo up there, man. Good God! It's a little chilly, isn't it? We don't play that sort of stuff here in the woods. You'll get shot! It's dangerous out here, man. Put your clothes on. (squishing) (droning instrumental music)
