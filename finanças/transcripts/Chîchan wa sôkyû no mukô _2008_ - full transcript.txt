Same for me! A bowstring strung tight, see the target... all is simple, but is the best, what can it be! A truly live... Not right! Even forget you alive or not! It can be experienced only in kyudo. I understand what you mean. Maybe we are similar. What is it? Why sitting in dark? [ Divorce Application ] [ Hisano Tomoko ] She has another man. Why do you think so? What another man! Do you see him? Do not make things up! You're just pathetic. Maybe mother just want to come back! Dad, you shouldn't be like that! - Why did you let her go? - Don't be so naive! "Hanako-san from 1st B.", "Bloody piano", "Cursed ladder", "Mossy Jiji", "Yoshida-san from the gym" What's next?... Yes! "Inseparable mirror!" If to believe the write in notebook, at this school is the legend of the seven wonders. Yes, but who would have thought! But the most interesting - a "Responsive sakura." That Sakura, remember? - What sakura - Don't you remember? One in which we made wishes! Oh! Yes-yes. So, it is necessary to reach that Sakura and say your request. When it's blooming, then grant any wish! Cool, huh? But it can only one do, who first test all school miracles. - It's amazing !! - Yes... - Well, you don't believe it? - What?

Abnormal, hikikomori? Let speak, I don't pay attention. But for real, not all like that. I was treated. Was treated? Yes. I have a brain disease. Therefore full rehabilitation took a whole year. Hayashida-san, you know about the "seven wonders" of this school? Yes. Why do you ask? It's a fairy tale. Hisano, do you believe in all this? No. If go the rumors, that you are interested in this, you will be considered crazy, a laughingstock. Better not to get involved. I'm not kidding. But still, some continue to talk nonsense. If you're not be careful, you will get into trouble. Hurry, Mon-chan! Hello! What is it? It's Hisano! Mon-chan, hurry! [ â„–4. mossy Jiji ] The fourth miracle. Here!

I'm sorry, I do not... So, so. Some rubbish are sticking. Unpleasant place! Muto-senpai! Hello. What are you doing here? Nothing. Came for you. Looks like you meet here with someone. Hisano-kun, Who made you absent from training? I brought him here! I'm sorry. As a head of the kyudo section, - I can't allow such behavior. - It's my fault! But why are you here? - I can explain! - I come to make a wish. Competition soon. There is mossy Jiji... Mossy Jiji? Yes. They say mossy Jiji-san grants wishes. So what do you want? I'm a god, wish-fulfilling. Make a wish. Mossy Jiji! You really could grant the wishes? Muto-senpai Stop joking! Really! It's all true, seven wonders - the truth! So, say your heart's wish. Mossy Jijo-sama, I want... I want... I want... Chii-chan! I'm joking! Sorry. I'm very scared, when you believe in this stuff.

So, this is true. We hinder you? - Yuuto... - Enough! Don't say anything! I don't want to hear your voice anymore! I offer the forces of darkness. Let my prayer be heard. I have a message for you. Hayashida died yesterday. Death suddenly. Tonight the farewell. The day after tomorrow - funeral. I ask all possible to attend. I understand, you are shocked her fate. Where is she now? What happens when you die? How you know, actually, who died, or not? Continues to believe that she's alive? I have to apologize to Hayashida-san. I were terribly unkind with her. Made her a ghost. With the 4th of the seven wonders, Mossy Jiji. Yes, but what she told about me! And ignored! I told her to not bother you. Stay away. Wrong. How do this make dying? It's just a coincidence.
