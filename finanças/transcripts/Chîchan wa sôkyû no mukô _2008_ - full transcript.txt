Same for me! A bowstring strung tight, see the target... all is simple, but is the best, what can it be! A truly live... Not right! Even forget you alive or not! It can be experienced only in kyudo. I understand what you mean. Maybe we are similar. What is it? Why sitting in dark? [ Divorce Application ] [ Hisano Tomoko ] She has another man. Why do you think so? What another man! Do you see him? Do not make things up! You're just pathetic. Maybe mother just want to come back! Dad, you shouldn't be like that! - Why did you let her go? - Don't be so naive!

If to believe the write in notebook, at this school is the legend of the seven wonders. Yes, but who would have thought! But the most interesting - a "Responsive sakura." That Sakura, remember? - What sakura - Don't you remember? One in which we made wishes! Oh! Yes-yes. So, it is necessary to reach that Sakura and say your request.

Abnormal, hikikomori? Let speak, I don't pay attention. But for real, not all like that. I was treated. Was treated? Yes. I have a brain disease. Therefore full rehabilitation took a whole year. Hayashida-san, you know about the "seven wonders" of this school? Yes. Why do you ask? It's a fairy tale. Hisano, do you believe in all this? No. If go the rumors, that you are interested in this, you will be considered crazy, a laughingstock. Better not to get involved. I'm not kidding. But still, some continue to talk nonsense. If you're not be careful, you will get into trouble. Hurry, Mon-chan! Hello! What is it? It's Hisano! Mon-chan, hurry! [ №4. mossy Jiji ] The fourth miracle. Here! Chii-chan, I need to go on a lesson! Mossy Jiji! He is older than school. In a difficult situation he can get rid of the enemy. From anyone.

I'm sorry, I do not... So, so. Some rubbish are sticking. Unpleasant place! Muto-senpai! Hello. What are you doing here? Nothing. Came for you. Looks like you meet here with someone. Hisano-kun, Who made you absent from training? I brought him here! I'm sorry. As a head of the kyudo section, - I can't allow such behavior. - It's my fault! But why are you here? - I can explain! - I come to make a wish. Competition soon. There is mossy Jiji... Mossy Jiji? Yes. They say mossy Jiji-san grants wishes. So what do you want?

Mossy Jijo-sama, I want... I want... I want... Chii-chan! I'm joking! Sorry. I'm very scared, when you believe in this stuff.

Hayashida died yesterday. Death suddenly. Tonight the farewell. The day after tomorrow - funeral. I ask all possible to attend. I understand, you are shocked her fate. Where is she now? What happens when you die? How you know, actually, who died, or not? Continues to believe that she's alive? I have to apologize to Hayashida-san. I were terribly unkind with her. Made her a ghost. With the 4th of the seven wonders, Mossy Jiji. Yes, but what she told about me! And ignored! I told her to not bother you. Stay away. Wrong. How do this make dying? It's just a coincidence.
