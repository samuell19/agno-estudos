Any opposing ideology was denounced as 'Red. ' The Kyoto University Incident was one example of this tactic. Although this film was inspired by that historical event, the characters portrayed herein are entirely fictional. " KYOTO Yukie. Professor! Father! Flowers on the knoll Blazing crimson red Plants along the river A bright, glowing green I sigh in delight at the flowers of Kyoto The moon rising high above Mount Yoshida The earth smells so wonderful. The sky's nice too. So is the wind. It's all wonderful. I can see the university! Freedom! Kyoto Imperial University, cradle of freedom! Resplendent ivory tower! Mecca of learning! "Cradle of freedom"? We can sing about academic freedom all we want, but fascism's on the rise since the Manchurian Incident. Back on your favorite subject, I see. Itokawa, are they on maneuvers? I can see them. They look tiny from here. I love that sound. It's so clear and rhythmic. It makes my heart race! - What's wrong? - A snake? I'm exhausted. We're getting old. ACADEMIC FREEDOM UNDER ATTACK PROFESSOR YAGIHARA EXPELLED FROM UNIVERSITY EDUCATION MINISTER'S DECISION PROVOKES FACULTY IRE STUDENTS RIOT IN DEFENSE OF FREEDOM YAGIHARA RESIDENCE The militarists, backed by industry, seized Manchuria from China. Japan then pulled out of the League of Nations. They hope to resolve Japan's internal contradictions through foreign conquest. All you talk about are Manchuria, militarists, and industrialists. I hate leftists. That's not true. And it's all relevant. They want the public to support their expansionist agenda. My father is a liberal, not a Red. They brand anyone who opposes aggression a Red. My father is in the right, and right will prevail. He said the same thing. He wants the faculty to resign en masse to make the minister reconsider. But the minister's a party boss with connections to industry. He's colluding with the militarists to suppress freedom of thought. "Make him reconsider"? How naive. Then what do you suggest? As I said before, the Manchurian Incident was a result of the militarists' expansionist policies. We must fight to overthrow militarism - nothing less. We tried to convince your father, but he wouldn't listen. Wait and see. The faculty will lose. You almost sound happy! I want them to win! But as long as they're naive and blind to the truth, they're bound to lose! Let's not talk about this. It's boring. Unlike you, I don't think the world runs solely on logic. There must be more beautiful things, more pleasant things. Itokawa, you want to hear some nice music? Come on! That's the trouble with you. Why don't you listen to what people say? All you know of life are the pretty scenes outside your window. Surrounded by your father's fawning students. Maybe you need a slap in the face to grow up. You ridicule logic, but beauty and pleasure not founded on reason are mere bubbles. Itokawa, turn the page! - Leaving so soon? - Yes. My regards to the professor. Won't you stay for dinner? - I'm in a hurry. - I see. Look. Leaving already? Noge, it's outrageous what the minister just said. "I'll shut down an entire department if that'll solve the problem. " That's where things stand. The professors at Tohoku University rose up too. Professor... I know you don't approve, but I've decided what I must do. I like your spirit, but don't neglect your duties as a student. What's wrong? You want to smoke? Are you sure? Ltokawa... get on your knees. Kowtow and apologize to me. For what? Whatever you want! Just do it, okay? Please. Come on, hurry up! Okay? What are you doing? Stop! That's enough! Don't let Noge get to you. He's so brazen. He's blunt with everyone. That's okay. He was just telling the truth - something you're incapable of doing. Sorry to keep you so late. Nonsense! I'm just a janitor, but for academic freedom, I pull out all the stops! You can't fight on an empty stomach. You're all right, old man. I'm very fond of Mr. Noge. If I were a girl, I wouldn't leave you alone. FEDERATION OF STUDENT SELF-GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATIONS TRUTH LIES IN ACADEMIC FREEDOM FIGHT FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH HELP OUR COMRADES IN KYOTO EDUCATION MINISTRY PERSUADES PROFESSORS TO RECONSIDER PROFESSORS RETRACT RESIGNATIONS KYOTO UNIVERSITY WILL NEVER SURRENDER! STOP FASCISM! EDUCATION MINISTER PLAYS GOLF WITH BUSINESS, MILITARY LEADERS RIOT POLICE CALLED IN RIOT LEADERS ARRESTED ACADEMIC FREEDOM CRUSHED KYOTO UNIVERSITY CAPITULATES KYOTO UNIVERSITY INCIDENT ENDS DEFEATED STUDENTS SENT HOME; PROFESSORS DISPERSE Where's Noge? What happened to him? Pull yourselves together! Stop moping. We lost the battle, not the war! Gentlemen... I ask you to consider the situation calmly. Clearly we have lost. But, gentlemen... justice will certainly triumph. This year's flowers have been scattered, but when the time comes, they will bloom again. No matter... what hardships may befall a man, the important thing is that he try to learn from them. We did our best to resist the fury of the reactionaries. As we try to survive the times ahead, we must remember this incident as a valuable learning experience. Hundreds of miles from Tokyo Kyoto University Was caught in fascism's glare Freedom and independence were crushed beyond repair Of course, despair is a kind of escape, but escape won't solve anything. We want - Professor, we're determined to continue the struggle. We'll drop out if need be. Why stay here without freedom? Thank you. I appreciate your sentiments. But I can't approve of your approach. Why not, sir? What would I say to your parents? Think how sad they'll be if you drop out right as you're about to graduate. You said your sister is providing for you. She's endured so much. Think how she'll take the news. But Professor - I understand how you feel, but - The usual group of seven? Only five tonight. That's unusual. The cock of the walk couldn't make it. I wonder what happened to Noge and Itokawa. You finally entered university. Three years left to go, then two. You don't understand. All I've thought about is how many years you have left. Now you want to quit with just a year to go. If your father were still alive, you'd be free to do as you please. But you should think of me. We've been living on what your father left us, and there isn't much left. - I wish Noge were here. - Itokawa too. Where are they when we need them? - What happened to Itokawa? - He double-crossed us. - Double-crossed you? - That's not true. It's still not clear. He called this meeting and didn't show up! What about Noge? - Noge won't be back. - Why not? He disappeared a week ago. - Arrested again? - No, they released him. Student protests aren't enough for him. He goes all out no matter what he does. Good night. I'm worried. Their passion is a good thing - I mean about Yukie. She's concerned about Noge. Not that she said she loves him or anything - Those two are always quarreling. But I heard he quit school to join the leftist movement. What? Noge did? I'm worried. I think Yukie's taking it very hard. - Are they all here? - They went home. Went home? Do you know what they decided? About what? Will they quit school to continue the fight? Father was against it. Absolutely. Thank goodness. Did they accept his judgment? What a relief! You must be glad that you don't have to become a traitor now. I don't care if it makes me a traitor. I have good reasons for backing out. You wouldn't understand, but I - Hundreds of miles from Tokyo Kyoto University Was caught in fascism's glare Freedom and independence were crushed beyond repair Yesterday our dreams came to an end We left our homeland Swearing to return victorious Death is only acceptable serving our country with distinction Whenever the bugles sound the march We remember the sea of flags that saw us off It's beautiful! Miss Yagihara is very talented. It's no good. - Miss Yagihara! - Why are you doing that? Our teacher said that in flower arrangement you should express yourself freely. This isn't me. Then why not make it as you wish? What's wrong? Nothing. Mother... I wonder if I should marry Itokawa. I was just kidding! Just kidding! You know he's coming by tonight? PLEASE ENTER HERE There you go. Thank you for all your help. Thank you. What's the admission fee? - Admission fee? LEGAL ADVICE FREE OF CHARGE So what exactly is wrong about the work I'm doing? Why is it wrong to offer free legal advice? I didn't say it was wrong. But you were a key figure in the Kyoto University Incident. You're seen as having an ideological agenda. You must consider the times. So that's your opinion, Prosecutor Itokawa? Dear! Please don't be offended. No, I'm the one who went too far. Dinner's ready. Mr. Itokawa, Yukie arranged these flowers. What do you think? I'm no expert, but they look fine to me. That's rather faint praise. She was always a strange little girl. In elementary school she only drew things like airplanes and locomotives. By the way, I'll be bringing a special guest by soon. You have a surprise in store! It's Noge. Mother, I'll take those meatballs if you're not eating them. Is Noge well? He's changed a lot. Please walk him to the main road. - Where's the professor? - In his study. Scholars tend to neglect their guests. I won't bother him then. Mr. Itokawa... you mentioned bringing Mr. Noge here. Is that a good idea? - What do you mean? I'd like to see him, but I'm afraid - Don't do it. Don't bring Noge here. Why not? I'm... afraid. Of what? Of him. Why? Let's say... that I married you. My life would be calm and peaceful. Forgive me for saying this, but it would also be a bit boring. And with Noge? If I were to marry him, my life would blaze so brightly that I might be blinded. It's terrifying, but also enticing. Noge's a different man now. People change a lot in five years. Look how ladylike you've become. Furthermore, Noge spent that time in prison, where time takes on a different meaning. You all look so surprised. I break out in a cold sweat just thinking about those days. But I had a lot of time to study in prison. I read the Japanese classics, and the history of philosophy. When were you released? It's been a year now. I was paroled last winter. But you had to renounce your leftist beliefs to be released, right? That's right. In my case... Itokawa used his clout as a prosecutor. He agreed to be my guarantor and found me a job in the army. It seems human beings are weak, after all. I don't blame him, but Noge used to be a much more commanding presence. Did I have a halo around my head? Yukie. Yukie, what is it? They're leaving. Mr. Noge's leaving for China. We won't see him for a long time. Please come again. I shouldn't have come. What is it? Yukie's leaving home. What? Leaving home? She's so impulsive. All of a sudden she just - What's wrong? She wants to live on her own in Tokyo. I'll never understand that girl. Did you see her face when she said good-bye to Mr. Noge? So it's true after all. I can understand how she feels, but she often does the exact opposite of what she feels. But if she really loves him - I thought you really wanted her to marry Itokawa. But it seems Mr. Noge is willing to mend his ways and take a steady job. Yukie's already 25. Do you really think... Noge was sincere about that? He spoke very clearly. I'm not so sure. At any rate, I'm not eager to see them get married. Why? You don't think he'll do what he said? Where's Yukie? In her room. I was so glad when she started studying flower arranging. Stay here, will you? So you're leaving home? Yes. Look at you, running around like a homeless person. Let's sit down and talk. Are you sure you can support yourself? I studied typing and foreign languages. I can work for a trading company. I can make a decent living. You could find a job here in Kyoto. Think of your mother. I'm just so... disgusted with everything. I want to start my life all over again. Living out in the world... isn't as simple as you think. I know. But right now I feel as if I'm not even living. I want to at least go out into the world... and see for myself what it means to be alive. If you've thought this through, then go. Forge your own way through life. It's worth a try. But remember: You have to take responsibility for your actions. Freedom... is something you have to fight for. There will be difficult sacrifices and the heavy burden of responsibility. Remember that. Eight years after your resignation, seeing you in a ration line filled me with emotion. My wife caught cold and can't do the shopping. - I'm sorry. - It's nothing serious. Ever since our daughter left home, she's done nothing but complain. Is your daughter well? She's in Tokyo, right? She was working for a trading company, but that didn't work out at all. She wants to go to China. China? We're at our wits' end, though I understand how she feels. TOKYO Yukie! Is that you? Fancy meeting you here! - Long time no see! I'd heard you were living here. - What about you? - I was transferred here. Do you have plans tonight? Not really. How about dinner? It would be nice to catch up. Actually... I'm a married man now. I'll be a father soon. Congratulations! As with everything else, I did it to please my mother. It's been a long time indeed. Remember that picnic on Mount Yoshida? That was such a long time ago. That's okay. I'll help myself. We were so young back then in so many ways. Don't get me wrong. I'm being sentimental, not sarcastic. "A PROPOSAL ON THE SINO-JAPANESE PROBLEM" BY RYUKICHI NOGE Have you seen Noge since? He's in Tokyo now. It seems you didn't know. He's running the "Research Center for East Asian Politics and Economy. " He's working very actively. He's a real authority on China now. Political and business leaders rely on his opinion. Just shows you can't judge a book by its cover. You were wise not to marry him. But he certainly does lead a fascinating life. He's treading a fine line. The three of us used to go to movies and have heated debates, but I was always the third wheel. Please. You have a visitor. They didn't give a name. It's a lady. Hey, where's that visitor? Your parents let you leave just like that? When was that? When did I leave home? That day you came to visit. That day? It's been three years. I've changed jobs three times since then. They were never more than a way to put food on the table. I want something... I can throw myself into... body and soul. That's the kind of work I want. When I left home, my father told me I'd have to bear responsibilities and make sacrifices in the struggle for freedom. That's what I - That's the kind of work I want. That won't be easy. Who finds work like that even once in their lives? It's like finding the Bluebird of Happiness. Mr. Noge. You're keeping a secret, aren't you? Tell me. I want to know. I'm sure it's something wonderful. What's wrong with you? Don't start imagining things. Please, don't be so cruel! I used to be... so thoughtless, making a joke out of everything. But now - I'm such a fool. Here I am suddenly demanding secrets. Shameless, aren't I? Forget I ever asked. But there is one thing that worries me. It's Mr. Itokawa. - Itokawa? Perhaps I'm imagining things again... but I wonder if you should be working here in this office. What do you mean? If you don't know, then I guess it's okay. I see. I'm not sure what you're implying, but here's how I see things: Even if a man were doing something here that might provoke the authorities... going underground wouldn't help. They wouldn't be stupid enough to lose track of him. Then... what should that man do? Nothing in particular. He could be arrested the next hour or the next day... but until then, he'll calmly keep doing whatever he can. Yukie! I was afraid this would happen. The path before us is so steep. It's all right. I don't mind. I thought I told you not to come here. I had to. After all... who knows how many hours or minutes... we have left to be together? What's wrong? I'm making you a kimono... you might never get to wear! Welcome home. Did you write to your father? Why not? What should I write? That we have a happy life together? I owe him better. I owe your mother better, and you too. What do you mean? "No regrets in my life. " Isn't that our motto? It may be hard... but my life now feels more meaningful than ever. It's just hard to express that in a letter. Look at the clouds. Do you remember? Our picnic on Mount Yoshida? We were so young. "Defend academic freedom!" What is it? A tiny bug. It's so beautiful! The pattern of the dots is really exquisite. I just finished a big project. Aren't you happy for me? Let's have a big celebration. Good idea. I don't know what the project was, but I'm happy. That's my girl! You didn't know, and you didn't ask either. You just take care of me without complaint. Thank you. In ten years, the true story behind our work will be known. The Japanese people will thank us for what we've done. You understand, don't you? Good! Ouch! - What is it? - What's this? This? That's my weak spot. Your weak spot? The thing that weighs most on my heart. Something I shouldn't know about? No, you have a right to know about this. My father and mother. I haven't seen them in ten years. I can't bring myself to see them. I fear his scolding, just as I did as a kid. I'm afraid of my mother's tears. My poor parents. Damn it. I know that, in theory, by addressing larger social issues, I'm also addressing my problems with my parents. And yet - No regrets in my life. No regrets whatsoever. I have to step out for a while. What about dinner? I'll be back, of course. I'll bring a little reward for your efforts. Then I'll make a special dinner to celebrate. I'll be back soon. Welcome back - If you want to go home soon, tell us the truth. We already have plenty of evidence. How long have you been with Noge? How long have you been lovers? Speak up. Talk! Think it over carefully. You have plenty of time. Damn it! You're as stubborn as Noge. Want to see him? The thing is... he was plotting to sabotage the war effort. There's no hope of seeing him now. Punishment for spies has always been - He worked very hard... but it was all in vain. Want to hear some good news? Special news bulletin! On December 8th, Imperial Headquarters announced that Imperial Japanese forces commenced combat operations against American and British forces in the western Pacific. DECEMBER 8, 1941 Yukie Yagihara, out! Yukie. PLOT TO SABOTAGE WAR EFFORT SPIES ARRESTED RYUKICHI NOGE TOKYO DISTRICT PUBLIC PROSECUTOR Thank you for all you've done. My wife sends her thanks too. I'm afraid it wasn't much. Itokawa, I've come from Kyoto because I'd like to defend Noge. Defend him? What it says here about the case isn't what you told me the other day. Why are Noge's actions considered espionage? Ltokawa... in the ten years... since I left the university, what have I accomplished? Sometimes a child can show us the way. Noge taught me - Professor! No, I'm going to do it. I may be old - Professor! I'm determined to represent him. Professor... Noge died last night in his cell. Yukie! Yukie! Yukie, listen to me! - Don't say anything! - But Yukie! Fool! You were Noge's wife. Just think of everything he accomplished. He struggled and risked his life to save Japan from war. You were his companion on that path. You should be proud! When you left home... weren't you ready to face hardship? You knew there'd be sacrifices in the struggle for freedom. What are you doing? - I'm going to see his parents. - His parents? But Yukie! They're old and they live alone. But they didn't even come... to claim his remains. I know. That's why I have to go see them. You can't! Calm down, Yukie. I'm his wife! How could this happen? It's awful. People dig graves for dogs at night. That ungrateful son of ours. He did such atrocious things... that we can't even show our faces in public. That's deep enough. Give it here. So this is the pitiful state you come back in. All right then. Just wait here a spell. We'll be joining you soon. My husband boarded up the doors and windows. We have to work after dark, like owls. SPIES LIVE HERE Please let me stay here. I'll do anything. Anything! - You don't have to. - I want to! Listen to me. Our way of life is completely different from yours. But can't I learn? I'll do whatever you teach me to do. Please let me try. But - I'm ready. But that isn't all. There are other things to worry about. Do you know what the villagers call us? A family of spies. Spies! I beg of you, let me stay. I was his wife. Please! I won't go home. I won't! Rotten, ungrateful son! That rotten boy! I was Noge's wife. I was Noge's wife. What are you doing? My husband - Where are you going? We're night owls. If you go out in the day, they'll cause you grief! Yukie, wait! Spy! Spy! Mother! What's wrong? No regrets in my life. No regrets whatsoever. Remember that there'll be sacrifices in the struggle for freedom. In ten years, the true story behind our work will be known. The Japanese people will thank us for what we've done. You understand, don't you? No regrets in my life. No regrets whatsoever. Yukie. Time to get up. We're planting the rice today. What's wrong? Don't overdo it. Do you feel ill? No, I'm fine. Good morning. Hey, you have a fever. That's not from the fire. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. Look at that! We finished the whole field! Yukie! What's wrong with you? Don't just sit there without a word. At least say hello to her. Ask if she's tired. Tell her she did a good job. Just say something! She works so hard. Really, now. You won't find a better daughter-in-law in all the world. She's a great woman. Why'd you think she was out to trick us? Ryukichi... Ryukichi was really - This is awful! Who did it? Who would destroy our rice paddies? How could any farmer do that? What kind of farmer would destroy rice paddies? Yukie, where are you going? You're not feeling well! Where are you going? KEEP OUT, TRAITORS KEEP OUT, TRAITORS KEEP OUT, SPIES Dear! Damn them! Damn fools! You rotten sinners! Curse you all! Yukie! Excuse me. Would you know where the Noge residence is? The Noge residence. What a surprise! No, more than a surprise! It was your mother who sent me, not your father. Frankly, I don't want to see you rot away here either. Noge may have taken the wrong path, but that doesn't mean - All right, you win! I don't know whether it's zeal or devotion, but your sheer life force makes me feel ashamed. I'll talk to your parents. I'll tell them it's silly to worry about you. In any event... please show me the way to Noge's grave. I've come all this way. I should pay my respects. Don't. Perhaps I should feel grateful... but I won't allow it. I doubt Noge would be pleased by your visit. Prosecutor Itokawa may believe that Noge took the wrong path in life... but ultimately only time will judge whose path was the right one. DAY OF JUDGMENT: THE WAR IS LOST, BUT FREEDOM IS RESTORED There is one man who... more than anyone else, I wish could have seen this day. He fought for academic freedom. Moreover, he risked everything in the service... of peace and prosperity for Japan. He was the pride of our university. His name was Ryukichi Noge, and he is no longer with us. However... there was a time when Noge sat right over there where you gentlemen are now sitting. I hope and expect... that many, many more men like Noge will arise from your ranks... and that is why... I have decided, despite my age, to return to teaching. It's so quiet. How many years has it been since a day like this? These last ten years feel like a fleeting dream. I wake up to find that nothing has changed. Your father left for the university today. If you moved back, everything would be just like before. Are you really going to leave? If Noge's parents understand his actions now, haven't you accomplished your goal? No. I've put down roots in that village. Mother, look at my hands. They look so out of place on a piano now. Besides, there's still so much work left to do there. Their lives - especially the women's lives - are brutally hard. If I can improve their lot even a little, my life will be well spent. You could say I'm the shining light of the rural cultural movement. You were born to suffer, my child. Why? I've never seen myself that way. And I'm not just putting on a brave face. Noge always used to say... "No regrets in my life. " That's the source of my happiness.
