I just can't stand those slutty girls bragging anymore. Why? What happened? Always saying, "my mummy bought me this and that, nobody brings you anything." Brats. What's the ruckus? What are you girls up to?! Come! Come, I want to show you... Let me tie that up for you. These are her granny pants! -The fat one? -Yeah. That is so big on you. Let me help so you may be as Mother Amparo! But what in the world is happening here? Because of the lack of respect you have shown, you are no longer allowed to stay here. Raise your arms, it's no time to cry. Now you cry. Enough gossiping, come on. THE ANIMAL'S WIFE Paputas! Lend me twenty bucks, I need 'em. -Good afternoon, Sir. -Hello honey. Do you know where I could find a woman called Flor? -Flor? Gildardo's wife? -Yes. Sure, head down there, about four houses. Thank you. Let me know if you get lost, honey. They call me Diablo. Sister! Amparo! What are you doing here? Flor, it's that I ran away from the Convent. You ran away? Why did you do that? Because I tried on Mother Pastora's habit so she got furious and punished me. And she called our father. I wasn't going to let him come and take me! So, are you going to let me stay? No, come, come. I will speak to Gildardo. But tell me. How did you do that? Girls, how are you doing? -Fatima, I brought what you asked for. -Gildardo, you brought me the shirt? -Yes ma'am. -Oh great! -I'll let you know the price later. -Okay. Thank you. -See you soon. -You too. Look, put it... Hello dear, how did it go? Not very well, too much stuff to do, people don't pay up. I'm not sure what to do, but I got a little bit. -Amparo is here. -She put on the nun's habit. Amparo. Hello, Gildardo. What's going on Amparo? Why did you do that? They called our father, and I wasn't going to leave her with him again. You know what he's like. Your father... He's a difficult man. I know what he's like. So... you tell me Flor, what are we going to do with her? Well, she came to see if we let her stay with us. Okay. She stays, but you must help out Flor. Don't worry, Gildardo, that I'm going to get busy. I'll get a job and help around the house as well. I'm going to find you another outfit that matches these others. Because I'm not taking you out in those pajamas. I'm not crazy enough to go back out. And let them catch me? They'll take me to the Good Shepherd's jail and people say it's full of lesbians in there. Don't be so silly Amparo, those nuns will never come up here. But my father might, and he will take me. Our father? Amparo, nobody knows where we live. Nobody. -Hello, Mum. -My dear son. How's the packing going? Can I carry anything out? Yes, the pigeon house and this box, I'm almost done. -Virgelina, how are you? -Good, Flor, and you? Good. Can I help you with anything? Don't worry about it. You don't want to see an old woman's secrets. Virgelina, look, do you remember Amparo, my sister? Of course. How do you do Amparo? It's a pleasure Virgelina... Very well thank you. Good, I'm glad. She's going to come live here with us for good now. Really? How come? Didn't you live in a convent? I left that place to come live here with my sister. That's nice. I was telling Amparo how all these houses around here are your family's, from Argelia, where your going to right? That's right. Ten years now, since we arrived here, because the violence between politicians was very hard, so we all had to leave. But all that has changed now, it's nice. I try to stay there all year round. -Mum! -Yes, daughter. -Mum, look. -I'm coming. What's happening? I brought some things for you to take to our family. -Allow me, I will grab them for you. -Very well. Thank you Flor, if you can bring them over here. Okay mum. God bless, the virgin protect you, say hello to all. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Take care. I will. Flor! Won't you come by for a little bit? Yeah, in a minute I'll go help you. Jairo's here with his friends. I'll wait for you. What's up Jairo? Drunk already, so early? But Flor my love, always with the nagging? In my house! I've been working hard as a mule, look at my hands. How long since I last saw you? Let me check you out! -Look, I'd like you to meet Amparo. -Goodness gracious, you brought delivery? Lord, you have sent her to me! How you doin' gorgeous? Jairo Zapata, thirty three years waiting for you my love. -Amparo Garcia. -Welcome home. She ran away from the convent. Why do that, honey? You must have done something quite bad. No, just do naughty things to the nuns. You like doing naughty things? I do also, come on inside we'll do "naughty things"! Have you met my mother? Your mother in law. Berta! Mother! So Berta, I've arrived. What can I help you with. Come on in, there's plenty to do. Get a move on girls, inside. That's enough gossiping all right. I'm only making diner for Jairito. I'm doing nothing for the two of you. These are the dishes that must be washed? Yes, that's right, yes my darling. I'll wash 'em out here. -Where are my scissors? -Oh, I don't know! -Hello, Maria Eugenia. -Hello, Libardo. -How're you doing cousin? -How have you been? Hurry up girls. -Why do you rough them up so much? -No, they have to get to school now. Is breakfast ready? Yeah, on the stove. What do you have there? Check it! Oh Lord! What's that? Where did you get that from? I found this hen suffering so I gave it rest and brought it so we can make some stew. Yes I'll make some time. Excuse me, I'm going to wash some clothes here. Berta always gives me permission to wash here. Please go ahead, there's room on that side. This way I can avoid going down to the stream, because there's no water in my house. If I don't take these clothes ready my mother will insult me. -So you're Amparo's sister? -Yes, a pleasure, Amparo. Nice to meet you, Olga. Clean these up as well. I'm not washing that! If she only heard you. My mum sent you. Get a move in. I'm not washing those sneakers. If mother only heard you. She sent you. I've seen you hanging by yourself, maybe I'll just let one of my brother's friends know. Tell those ass holes I'm not afraid of them. Go on tell them. That's why I'm getting out of my house, I'm going to get a job. -Think you can help me get one too? -You like to work? Of course, I'm ready. And Flor, she doesn't nag you? If you go on a job? I'm into boyfriends... Do you like to dance? I don't know how to do that. No, I'll teach you. So we can get us a couple of boyfriends. Not for now, that's not really what I'm interested in. -Bye sweetie. -Bye, don't forget about the job. For sure. I'll come get you so we'll work together. -Okay. -Sounds good. Bye. I don't see her getting serious. Eating and sleeping. How are we going to throw the girl out on the street? You know how hard it is to be destitute. -What are you so happy about? -I got us both a job at a workshop. -Really? -Yes, we start Monday. -Do we! -Yes we do. -How's it going cousin? -How are you Olguita? Where are you coming from so cheerful? From the mountain my darling. You going to buy me a drink? -A drink? You wish. -You never have any to spare! We've got everything in my family! Even witches. That bitch is a witch. What do you mean she's a witch? Let's say you have a forbidden love, well she'll get it for you. The other day some man had a problem for calling her witch, so she killed two of his cows. Olga! Olga! -Good morning. Is Olga home? -Someone's here for you. Hey, that's my mother. That old hag. And you, where do you think you're going so ugly? No. My sister gave me these clothes. She dresses very badly, her husband dresses her that way. Look what I brought you. Look how beautiful this shirt is. How do I look like in this? Won't your mother get upset if you give me these clothes? Fuck her. Let me hold that for you. So how do I look? -Very pretty. -Really? I always dress like this. Get on with it, go change. I'm going to finish getting ready. -What do you think? Good? -You look pretty. Let me check you out. These pant are kind off tight. You look very good. You feel comfortable? Olga, who's that? That's my brother. Are you ever going to grow out of that habit? Good Evening Berta. -Good Evening Amparo. How did it go? -Very well. Ah, thank God. Here, I got paid today. This is for you. That's great. Save it so you can buy something for yourself. I bought this. -And when are you going to where it? -Tomorrow. Amparo! Amparo! Olga is calling, I'm going to see what she wants. Amparo! What's with the yelling Olga? -Oh dear, Olga what happened to you? -I fell against that door. -But it got you good. -It did, really. Don't touch it. Come with me. My brother wants to meet you. -Which brother? -My older brother who arrived last week. But why me? You know I can't go out this late at night. Come on, come on. He wants to meet you. Come on. Here, I brought her for you. -I'll be right back. -Where are you going? Just over there, you'll be okay here. How do you do Mr. Libardo? -Good honey, how you doin'? -I'm okay. -I sent for you. -Why is that? I am very interested in you. You are the most beautiful girl I have seen around here. How old are you honey? I'm super old. Old... What do you mean by Old? How many years is that? -I'm eighteen years old. -Eighteen? That's to be old? So how many boyfriends have you had? I've never had a boyfriend. I'm not interested in that. -Don't lie to me honey, there's no need. -What I like is to work. I shouldn't believe anything you say. You're kind off mysterious. I already found out you ran away from a convent, but don't worry that I'm not going to tell anyone honey. Specially, because you and I are very similar. Similar how? Why would you say that? Because we come from the same hole. Okay well, I have to leave now because otherwise my sister will nag me: Why am I taking so long, who I was with... I guess we'll be hiking up this hill daily. Hey, my sister says you should come over, she's at cousin Rubiela's house. -Who, Olga? -Yes. I'm going to see Olga a moment over at Rubiela's. -Okay, but don't be too long. -I wont. Oscar, wait for me! I brought her for you. -Hello Rubiela how're doing? -Amparo, my dear, come on in. And Olga? She was looking for me and I don't see her here. She's coming, I even have these plantains for your sister Flor, so you can take them to her. She's almost here. No it's okay, just give let me take them, and I'll come back later. -Come on, Amparo, come in. -Come on dear, it's fun. Sit down, for crying out loud. Why so aggressive all the time? -Come on, let's dance. -Love is such a heart ache. Yeah Rubiela. Oscar, come on have a shot. Are you going to have a shot darling? No, I don't like that. -You've never gotten buzzed? -No, ma'am. Oh but it's so nice. Maybe a water. Have a drink for fucks sake. Maybe it'll kill those worms you have. Yes, coming my love. Love you 'till I die. Serve us a drink godamit. What's up honey? You didn't like the drink? Should we give her another one or what? I told you it would work. -Oscar, have a drink. -No, what would I want that for? All right, then get the hell out of here, we'll talk later. What's happening? Hey, why haven't you come home. Oh sweetie, she's here, she's okay, I'll take her later. Have you been drinking? But what are you thinking? -Don't worry I'll take her. -No, Amparo, let's go home. Fuck off. Then do whatever you want, if you're just going to act like an ass. Almost there. Cousin... Cousin... Bitch! Someone. Libardo, why don't you have this coffee? Why hasn't the girl gotten up for breakfast? How did she wake up? She sleeps late. -Hello, Maritza. -How're you doing? Good. And Libardo? He arrived last night quite late with some girl, supposedly his wife. -Hello, Libardo. -Good morning, aunt. You arrived last night with your wife? Yes, I arrived last night to spend some days, I was bored of that neighborhood. Why hasn't she gotten up for breakfast? She's weak. That's the only bitch that gets sick from getting fucked. -Let me see, where is she? -Well go see in there. Goodness gracious. Enough with the nagging all day long. Oh Lord, but it's you Amparo, Flor's sister. What are you doing here with that guy? So you are the animal's wife? No, ma'am... He brought me here, and I had never been with any man. He ripped my clothes, I don't have anything to wear. He ripped all my clothes, I don't have anything to cover myself. I'm not even able to get up, because I'm bleeding Virgelina, help me. You know what he's capable of. I'm always afraid, but I'm going to see what I can do. What are you doing there? You have a lover hiding in these bushes? Be very careful, you will not tell anything about anything. I don't want to see you talking to nobody about anything, or I'll cut your tongue out. Nothing about what? I don't know. His stuff. In a Canteen, I found a friend... Virgelina. Hello dear. Please don't leave me alone with him anymore. Stay right here next to me, I'll teach you how to help me around the farm. Don't you see all those scars? He was grabbed with his father at the age of fifteen, his father was killed and he was left for dead. It's a miracle he's alive. -Mr. Joel! -How are you doing Ovidio? -Good and you? -Good. I'm sorry to bother you, but the word on the street is that your cousin Libardo has been staying here at the farm. Be careful, you know that they've been looking for him since the death of that old man. Of course, he has not come around here since all that. Look, just place the thin branches crisscrossed and you'll see. -Okay. -That's good. What else can I help you with? Let's peel the potatoes and the plantain, for now. Get a move on, pack our stuff that we have to get lost. I have these motherfuckers right on my trail. Get a fucking move on. Why do you make me push you around at all hours? Virgelina, please, don't let me go with him. You know who he is, and he says you always have to be by his side. -Let's go. Godamit! -I don't want to leave with him. I'll pray for your protection. Today! Get the hell up, Amparo, go make destiny, you spoiled brat. Get up! Still not done with breakfast? You expect me to make it for myself? -I'm almost done. -Always the same. Move! What's that? Who is steeling the food? Is it you? No, ma'am. Then who the fuck is stealing it because the food does not suffice. Hurry up! I'm hungry. What are you giving my son? That you have him like dumbfounded with you. Are you taking advantage of being here in the kitchen? I haven't given him anything. No. Is he sucking your pussy, chicken shit? What you looking at? Who you looking for? You were sent to wash, lets get going. Amparo! Amparo! Where were you? I arrived just last night, I was somewhere in Libardo's aunts house. What do you mean Amparo? Tell me, do you like that man? -I certainly do not. -Well? I didn't want to leave with him, I don't remember anything. Where are you living? You look skinny. Over at Mariela's. What do you mean? You are living with Libardo? Come on, or I'll tell the Animal you were talking with your sister. Amparo... Amparo come... -Amparo. -Lets go! Look! Check it out, see what you can find in there. Hey! How's it going? See if you can find a fat one. Nothing. Now we're talking, I got a silver chain! For tonight's party. It's just full of paper. Oh, a Virgin pendant! Fuck you man, you didn't bring anything for real. Remember I have brought you into my business, I've initiated you into the life. Why do you have to be such an ass? I'm telling you, let's go party, lets go bang some hoes, let's buy a bomb! Anything, what are we going to do? Morning, ladies. Amparo, hi. I'm here to help you wash. What can I do? These pants are quite dirty. I slipped my mother's watch. Look what I brought you. Oh, thank you Olga, I'm starved. I thought so. Do you still have a lot left? Yes, look. How many wallets did you steel today? Seven wallets, not thirty minutes ago I got off the bus, and now I'm here with the green and a golden chain. So, are you going to teach me how to pickpocket? You wanna learn? I will teach you. But if you get caught they'll beat you bad. Let's do it. Find an anthill, stick your fingers in it, move your fingers so they won't bight you, like playing piano. Let me know when you're nimble, I'll take you into the ring. -But you will take me, right? -For sure. Thank goodness you were a virgin because the animal once told me that if you weren't, he was going to kill you, and leave you behind. He once said "that brunette is going to be my wife, she's going to be the mother of my children, we even have the same last name: Garcia." But how could you hold your tongue? Why didn't you warn me? Because we're also afraid of him. When I was like ten years old, I think he rapped me, when he put it in it hurt me. I got away because I screamed. Hide that arepa, Amparo, quickly, hide it. This week I have some work coming in, Animal. Do the job, grab a beer, now some shots. What a good tune, man. Look what I got... What a beauty, let me see. This is my blade. The one that never fails? No, that's the bowie knife, so you have it quite clear my friends, once you stick it in there's no chance. So, in the end, was it worth it? Was she really a virgin or not. Of course it was worth it, she was a virgin for sure. For real man? She was? Thank you so much brother. I couldn't believe it, who could have thought that now a days you could find a nineteen year old virgin. Toast to that. I can't believe it, that's why I helped you out with the room that night. If it hadn't been that way, I would have left her that bitch over there. So Berta, have a drink with us. Have a drink mum, with us, we're celebrating. With a mouth full off flies I would have left her. Amparo! What are you doing, speaking with your sister? I'm going to fuck her too, teach her how to be a woman. Don't you dare hurt my sister. You have no reason to be speaking with anyone for fucks sake. What did you think? Learn some. What the fuck is happening? I'm fed up with the two of you! But don't you go on treating her like that also. And what is it with you, hitting her at all hours! What is the scandal? Is anyone going to let me sleep around here? Always hitting her! All right godamnit, I'm taking this bitch some place else then. But right away! I'd like to see you pull even a dime out of your pocket. I packed some old clothes that might fit you. God bless you. -Is that yours. -Yes. This is where you're going to live from now on. No fucking lover's around here. Or talk to anybody about anything, specially your sister, or I'll call both of you. Come here. Move it. We're going over here for a little bit. How's it going Animal. All good? Come on help me get Burrito on the landing strip he hasn't fucked today. Guys, meet my wife. You slung this cow away on your shoulder? You want get high, I have some pills. Guys, I've been organizing a score. You know what? I have seen the old store-owner down the street storing thirty bucks under his notebook. Lets go break the man if it's the case. What's been happening with you? Muerte? You've been so lost. Trying to get my hands on a couple bucks that's all. Not true, I've seen him outside the school waiting for the little boys to come out, pulls them into the bushes to suck their lollipops. That's how he roles. Come on, Chambon, don't be such a jerk. You switched sides at this age, muerte? Come here darling, come on. -What's up motherfucker? -We're all good Libardo, all good. -Feeling too kind? -Relax man, nothing's happening. Are you this bitches lover or what? Who the fuck is her lover then? Is it you? What's going on with you Libardo? Let it go. Is it you motherfucker? Which of you is her lover? Or is it this mother fucking table? Which one of you is it? A lover. Godamit now we're going to find out who you're lover is. We're out of here. Somebody help me. You drive me mad, upsetting me, always upsetting me. I beg you don't hit me anymore. Get the hell in there. Stay here, now you can hook up with your lover. Who is it, spying behind the house? What are you looking at? Hey! What are you doing asshole! Cover yourself! Don't you see someone spying on you. But move it! Get over here, what where you looking for inside my house? What's happening Diablo? What do you mean "what's happening"? What are you looking for here? Is your mother home? What for are you asking to see my mother. Get lost. She heads the community council, right? Yes she's part of the community council, why? The thing is my man, I want to be the treasurer. The treasurer? Do you take me for a fool? You know that we have to lay down water main, and electrical lines, and you need someone to rightly administer that money. You're just checking out my sister fagot. No Diablo, don't say those things, have some respect. You're a filthy, morbid Animal, and I don't want to see you rounding about my house or my sister ever again. Don't threaten me with that machete, chicken shit. Just come by here again and you'll see. See what, I'm already here, I'm here. Treasurer. Shut up. You know what brother-in-law, let's leave it at that. I'm not afraid of you. Tie the dog, so I can come by tonight. Dumbshit! What am I doing? What am I paying for? Forgive me, forgive me, Lord! Please hear me. -Go for it Chambon. -The girl, the girl, Teresita. Teresa. These assholes have knifes. Run, run, quickly. If they do anything to her, I'll kill them. But hurry! They took my girl. Someone help. Hey. Paputas, Animal, get sharp he's coming. Degenerates, let the girl go, come on! They killed my son, it can be, they killed him. He's alive. What are you doing there, checking out your lovers? My stomach hurts. Your just making it up. I have too much colic. Please don't leave me here. I'll be right back. Amparo, what happened to you? What are you feeling? -This pain is going to kill me. -Come with me, we're going home. You know I can't go anywhere. Of course you can, I already spoke to Libardo. All I've looked for you. Not even your sister knew where you where and you've been so close all along. I'm so scared. Not a chance, how are you going to continue living in these conditions? For Christ sake, I'm going to grab some things and we're going home, at least there I can do something for you. Wait a minute. Berta! Berta! Olga! Come help me carry this girl, she's sick. Help me. Amparo, what is it? I have colic pain. Libardo hit you? What's is it? Why are you like this? Where did he have you? What happened to you? Where were you? What is this bitch doing here? Nobody called you down here? Why do you have to come looking for me? She didn't come looking for you, I brought her. That bitch has no permission to leave the house. Where do you have here hidden up then? That's none of your business. Why do you stick your noses in my life? Why don't you let her come over, so she can earn a meal, since you don't give her anything? There's nothing up there, all alone, and this girl is sick, look at the condition she is in. The three of us should go brother, she doesn't look good, it's better if a doctor sees her. I don't have any money. I'll lend you some, I have enough for the bus. You know what, do whatever you want, you already ruined my breakfast. Come on, let's do it. Let's take her to the hospital brother. Come on. Amparo, it looks like they're going to take you to the hospital. Let me help you clean up a little bit. Let's wash your hands and feet at least, it's that you smell a little bit. Did you set up the deal with the Animal? Mariela, I'd prefer if the agreement was with you to avoid problems with your son. No don't worry, he has to become responsible for something in his life. If he doesn't pay or something else happens just let me know and I'll beat up that idiot. Finally, were you not going to show up. I already handled the room, just you make me look bad! What was it? -A girl. -Damn it. I will fuck these daughters of mine before any motherfucker does, and then whore 'em out so they can maintain me. Thank you, sir. Silvia really is a wonderful woman. She's really worth it. You know what, fix the girl up for me. Why, what do you mean? Where are you taking her? I'm taking her to Silvia's, because there she will grow, she'll nurture her better, you're a bad mother. But why, if I'm the one who had her. Because I say so. There is no way you are taking the girl! You will not take her! Let go! Give her two me or I'll yank her arm off. I'll yank her arm off. I will take her, just give me a chance and I'll disappear her. Hey Animal! Check out who's coming over there. Where do you think you're going? Get over here. I'm going to have another child, I have twenty already around here. What is this? Come on, let's shake all these shadows, leave them the rest. Have some meat. Muerte, I'll take this baby for you. Let it be God's will. Flor! Flor help me. What happened? Why? Help me, I need to get out of here! But where are you going to go if you don't have anywhere. That man wants to take the girl, he wants to give her to another woman. I have to take us from here. -Gildardo, give her money. -I don't have any... -What's happening here? -Cousin, nothing's happening. What are you doing? Are you helping this bitch. Traitors. I'm not hiding her cousin. Where are you going you ungrateful bitch? Let her go, don't hit her! Don't hit her anymore! Don't hit her like that anymore! Ungrateful bitch. Don't hit her any more. I'm going to call the police. Police! What justice? Justice is what I'm going to give you. Get over here, don't run away you coward. You fucker, call the police! Weren't you going to call? Get the hell lost, I don't want to see you ever around here again. I'll wack you up. Always pissing me the fuck off. You get in there, and just you come out so you can see blood. Son of a bitch, blood! Open up, come on open up. Pack everything up. -We're going to live some place else. -What do you mean? Where? Why? Just get a move on, we're going to Santa Rita. But the girl is... The guys are here to pack up and take you so move it, that we need to get lost. I'll see you later up by the creek. There they are, run sweetie. Where is it? Go on ahead, Amparo, you're almost there, go up to the second floor, the Animal's waiting for you. What's up? Why did it take you so long? I bought this birdhouse, and downstairs as well. That's why I'm telling you, if anybody comes nosing about, you just tell them that it's been long since you've been living here. This is nice, you two will be okay here. Flagrant naked flower. Dorita, come. Come here you slut so we can kill each other. I'll whack you. Or did you think I was joking! Open the fucking door! Open the fucking door! So we can kill each other. I'm going to knife you. I'm not buying your bullshit. Get over here. -Good morning. Ma'am. -Yea, how can I help you? How do you do? Could you do me a favor? Tell me. I don't have water downstairs, so I was wondering if maybe you could let me use yours to sooth my boys skin, he's burnt. Come in. That man hit him. I do you call him man, are you not his lover? I'm not going to get upset about that, it's better for me. He arrives at night and beats up the boy, because he cries, or because he's sleepy. He doesn't let me get close to the boy to feed him or anything. You live with him? No, Ma'am, he threatens me to stay there, saying he'll kill my son, kill all my family. What's your name? Amparo. Look sweetie this beautiful baby. Who's is it? Our neighbors, say hello. This cream will help sooth his wounds. I'm telling you, I used to live so well when I was at home. But they kicked me out when I became pregnant with Carlitos. That's when I met Libardo, he was silly for me, started buying me soda, buying me dinner. Then, when Carlitos was born, he starts hitting the boy, hitting me, he told me "you must bare with me a boy, white like you." Because the girl he had with you is brunette too. When I get my period and can't be with him, he beats me because I have no right to be wasting his blood. That I had gotten on to the wrong bus. I'm going to take the boy, maybe he comes back and if he finds me here, he's capable of killing me. Get the fuck out here you slut. So everyone can see what a whore you are. Go to the store already, let them see you whore. Move it, or I'll give you some also. Have a bight. -No. -What happened? I can't stand the smell. Since when have you been feeling that way? For a couple of days now. Are you with pregnant? I'm not sure but I think so. -Did you get that thing yet? -No, I haven't gotten my period. I think you are with child. But don't expect anything from that man. I'm afraid to end up on the street. Ma'am, how should I put it. This corner is mine, the birdhouse on the second floor. This neighborhood is beautiful. Let me show you the patio, so you will buy it. Take a look at it. Motherfuckers, let go of the girl. Let her go! Motherfuckers, let her go! What are you doing to that girl! Let her go, let her go! Fucking bitch. Nosy jealous, motherfucker. What's wrong with you? What's with you? Stop it, don't hit my mother any more... -Where are we going? -Right there, wait here. Julio, come let's do it on this side, we don't want anyone to notice. Why? What happened? She's the Animal's wife. Julio, we're here so you will cut her hair. Look how he has her. That way he wont be able to grab her this way. Cut her hair. I don't want to get into trouble with her husband. Look at me, I'm all beat up. Cut it or lend my the scissors and I'll cut it myself. But please don't let me leave like this. That's enough, out you go, to play outside. All right it's time, I'm here for what is mine. What the hell happened to you? You really think I'm going to strip a faggot? Fucking bitch! Not anymore, you will never grab me by the hair again. What am I going to grab you for? Or drag me around like a street dog. Why do you betray me so? Until today. Never again. Dorita, come here. What did your father say? Did he hurt you? But you have to get my hair right. You always leave bumps. That's not true I do it good. Come on quickly, we're late. -Hello. -Hey Amparo. How are you? Hello Amparo. Oh Amparo, you really do look terrible bold. You do, who sheared your hair off like that? This one doesn't know, pass me the paper I'll show Amparo the latest. Look Amparo how this idiot got caught. He went downtown to rob, 'cos he has nowhere else to go. He got drunk at a canteen, fell asleep, so they caught him and beat him up. We haven't seen him but we have been told, that they got him pretty good. It took them long enough. Come out! It's the national police. -Fucking coppers, what do you want? -Stop right there! Mum, tell them it's not me... It's not him. Let's move. Fucking old bawd. What business is it to you? Where are you hiding him? Aren't you the police? Are you that stupid to think he's going to be at his mother's? You're heading straight to prison for being his accomplice, for bearing that depraved rapist son of a bitch you have for a son. Let's move. I didn't bear coppers, that's their beauty. What's happening? What are you doing together, talking about your lovers? Weren't you in jail? What jail? Those assholes didn't stand a chance, but they're right on my trail. We're going to hide in Santo Domingo. I already got a place up there, and sold this one. And you... go to your mother's, we have to vacate. I'm happy because I know that boy is my own blood. Paputas! Come on man, grab all the stuff and get out. Don't forget the crates... -Amparo, how's it going? -Good and you? I'm exhausted. How did you make it up here with that belly? I was at my mother's who lives just down there. Then I came up the creek which brought me straight here. What do you think about the house? Pretty. So, what's up? Why did you call for me? It wasn't really me, it was Libardo. He wanted to ask you something. He wants you to come and live with us. I'm doing well where I'm at. This woman I met, Resfa, has been giving me everything. She's been giving me food and clothes, don't you see how I'm looking all pretty, all new and she bought everything for the baby. And she's helping you out just like that? Her daughter can't have babies. So I told them I would give them mine. What do you mean "give them yours"? Okay well, that's your decision. Come on, say hello to Dorita, look how big she is. How are you doing Chila? What's new ma'am? Your the midwife right? How have you been? Good. -What was it? -A very beautiful boy. -You're telling the truth right? -Of course. Sleeping all day. Get lost. Amparo gave birth last night. I need you to go for the baby. But how could I possibly bring that baby here? Don't argue! That boy is her sister, and we're going to bring him up. Don't you piss me the fuck off. Your shirt? Go get it. It's the next house over, it's a boy. Go bring him here, we're taking him home with us. I'll bring the child, but what for? To make him suffer? I have nothing to offer him. Go on, and if they don't give him to you, tell them I will dynamite the house to the heavens. Come, I'll show her to you. I'll show her to you, so you can see what a beautiful girl she is. Come here my baby, look, meet her. -The girl? -The girl. Amparo, why did you come? Come here, I'll tell you something. Libardo says you have to send him the boy. -Don't you see it's a girl? -No, he already knows it's a boy. If you don't send him with me he will blow the house up with dynamite. And you know he's capable of doing it. -Resfa, we have to send the boy. -We do? Why? His father already know he's a boy and sent for him. If we don't hand him over he will come and blow up the house. I would give my life to protect this baby from that miserable man. Now that I've bought everything for the baby he comes to take him away, then I'll send him bare naked. What are you doing? Why are you taking his clothes off? That's how I'm giving him to you. Like that? With nothing at all? Yes, because I bought everything, so I will not give him anything. But I don't have anything for this baby. Have the father buy some. He's actually pretty cute. Don't fuck it up, if anybody comes around asking about it, you tell them this child is yours, ours. You know what? We will call this boy Libardo. What am I going to feed this child? There's nothing here, not even cane sugar. This boy must be cold, he must be hungry and I have nothing to give him. -Hello, Julia! -Hello, Amparo, sweetie. And that baby? This baby... he's Libardo's son, he took it from another woman and gave it to me. Amparo, why are you such a fool? It pisses us of, go away before my mother sees you. Go, go. -What happened? Hello sweetie. -Hello. -Who's that baby? -This is Libardo's son. What do you mean Libardo's? That's why I came, to see if you can help me. And you're stupid enough to take in some other whores baby? When you don't have enough to take care of yourself and your own. But it's not his fault. I only came to ask you for some food because I don't have anything to feed him at home. -I don't care, stop being such a fool! -Mum, don't yell at her. Wake up, don't you see your daughter is hungry? That's it, get inside. I don't know what you're going to do, but don't count on us. Mum, don't shut the door on her. Come on. Come on... Oh Lord... Man, it's el Diablo again around here. No son, after all that, when you were taken to the hospital, I went to find the girl, all broken. She hasn't gotten better. Sweetie, Dorita, come here, I forgot the soap at home, go get it. -Do you know where it is? -No. In the kitchen, in a little package. Don't be long. Dorita, come here honey... Come here. Dorita honey. What are you doing you son of a bitch? Why? It's your girl! Run! Why don't you rape your fucking mother? Nosy fucking bitch, get the fuck put of here. We're all going to die because of your miserable life. -Oscar, four eyes man. -Don't worry I'm here on the lookout. Be on your game. Hey, so should I humiliate you with one hand? Let's get technical. You guys suck, you can't play for... Fucking asshole. Get lost. Get lost. Leave this one to me. Motherfucker. Hold him there. Fucking die. Diablo! Diablo! Fucking hell that asshole got me. Chivo, let's get a cab for this guy. I'll live, but to hell with you. Come on man, this guy is pretty hurt. He got me, but I'll live. You do it with malice, don't you? Not with malice, I'm being careful! How far do you love me? No distance at all! When I'm gone, are you going to let some other fuck you? If he cares for me. I'm going to come back from hell and kill that motherfucker and you while I'm at it. You really believe the Lord will let you come back from hell to kill me. I have the right to be loved, respected, to be valued as a woman. You're a badass bitch. You know what, bring the children down tomorrow. Oliverio! -How are you doing Libardo? -How's it going bro'? Going on a bender or what? Three days and counting, I've even been drinking moonshine. How can you drink like that with your gut hanging out? It's nothing. What the hell is that? It's disgusting. I've been working through it. But you know I'm protected from above. If I had something like that I'd be dead by now. -What do you need? -A flask of rum. It's fifteen bucks now, before it was fourteen fifty. What a beauty. You right it up, I'll erase it. Boom. -At least credit me something. -Have a drink on my account. No, I'm not drinking, not on the job man. All right, man, good principles in any case. -Take care, Oliverio. -Pay me something, man. -Look. -Okay. Animal! Look at that. Virgin Mary, what a honey pot. We should run a number on those three. They've killed this motherfucker. The Animal's been killed! The Animal is dead. They've killed the Animal! The Animal's been killed! The Animal is dead. -What's happened Oscar? -The Animal's dead. Mariela, they killed the Animal. Oh no! What do you mean? Not my boy. Oh Lord why? Go Julia, go see. Thank you Lord for having heard me. Libardo, no. Finally someone killed that asshole, that damaged this community so much. Why didn't you say anything, you cowards when he was alive? We're mourning here, have some respect! Long live the Animal's wife! Long live the cubs! These are not the Animal's children, they are mine.
