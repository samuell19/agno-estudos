So if you call me Bruce one more time, I'm gonna slap the boy out of you. Deal? Bruce, The Bruce, you know what? I've always been wanting to know why the fuck do you call yourself The Bruce anyway? Quite simple, my dear Carla. In this big, big world, there are many Bruces, but there's only one TheBruce. And that's who I am. A far more important and pertinent question would be why. Simply because you like to date women. But you feel the oppressive and overwhelming need to dress like a man. Oh, kiss my ass. I'd love to. Where is it? Show it to me. You know that's not gonna happen. I know no such a thing. I know I'd like to see it, if you don't mind showing it. Okay. Excellent. I'm better. Aha! Knew it! Knew it! God is looking at you. Clem.

And to answer your question, "What is this?" this is a metronome. [ticking] 4x4 time is a heartbeat. No, no, no, I'm talking about me. Why did you call me? Well, I just, uh, I just needed your help, to be honest. You know, sometimes you can't just trust what you thinking. You gotta find somebody that's kinda like you, but not you, you know? You got your money and your businesses and the girls and, you know, that life, but what were you when you started? And I figured you're probably just like me. Aren't you just like me? Yeah, we're exactly alike, yeah. That's what I was thinking when I saw your work ethic and whatnot. I didn't want to jump to conclusions about anything because that's one of my pet peeves, when people jump to conclusions and accuse me of things I ain't never done. That's what gets me angry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fucked up. You know Clem, don't you? A lot of people think Clem is some sort of security, but no. Clem is a social worker. His job is to help me socially, make sure I don't get angry because... he gets angry when I get angry. And so I try, oh, I try not to get angry for Clem don't get his dander raised. No, no, no, no. But now I was doing some mathematical accounting, something you probably know about since you're just like me. - Ain't you just like me? - I-I'm just like you. Just like me. Excellent. So now I wouldn't let somebody know if I was in financial trouble, but it's financial trouble that I'm in. I don't know where my money's gone, but it ain't where I put it, and it don't equal up to the amount I needed to equal out to, but I'm a little short. I was hoping to cover this $100 discrepancy I found myself in, and maybe I can count on you to loan me that $100 and trust that I'm a good businessman and a man of my word and I'd get that money back to you lickety-split. Oh, man, you know I don't make that kind of money. [chuckles] Yeah, you're right. I don't know what I was thinking. Yeah, I can see how that'd be a bit much. I mean, I'd be a little nervous if you did have 100, you know what I mean? Then you've been stealing. [laughing] What do you have? Look, look, you don't have to tell me to the dollar. I'm saying a ballpark figure. What do you got there? I don't know what I got in my pocket. What do you think you got on it? Guess for me. I got maybe 5. Maybe 5? I'd love maybe 5. You know why? Because I only needed 100, and now I only need 95, thanks to your maybe 5, and I sure appreciate it. Could you produce that maybe 5 for me, please? $20! [chuckles] Thank you. You are just like me. Give somebody your last money if they needed it. Ain't that right? I-It's yours.

Wanna have a drink? No, thanks. Let me ask you a question. Why a male strip club? Well, that's a good question. It deserves a good answer. You saying it's already enough of a decision that you should be in the strip club business at all, but a male strip club? I didn't want to pimp no women, but my pimp hand is strong. I'm a firm believer that sometimes everything's that's good for you ain't that good for you. I'm saying I love candy, but I know I can't be in the candy business for I love candy too much. Why, I'd just eat up all my money. Consequently, with female strippers, I care too much. She get pregnant, it hurt my feelings. Somebody cut her face, I wanna cut theirs. I'm wondering where she is when she late. I wonder, is her baby sick? No, that wasn't for me. It ain't about what you decide you gonna be later on in life. It's about what the fuck you are. I was just like you one time. I wanted to be tall and dark and handsome, and I found out I wasn't gonna be none of that. That's when you got to come to grips with your own self. What is you? I'm a fruit. We all fruit. Everybody want to pick the good fruit. "I's a melon. I's cantaloupe. I'm a honeydew. I'm pineapple. I'm so sweet." Nobody ever stands up and says, "I'm a lemon." No, even the word "lemon" has an unsavory type of connotation to it. Who wants to be a lemon? No, baby, we wanna be a millionaire. We wanna be anything, but we don't wanna be a lemon. Why is that? Well, it smell good and all. I mean, they are fruit, but they just not sexy. They too sour. Too-- Oh! Too strong. They... so aggressive. I'm saying God done made whatever fruit you call delicious. He made this one too. He don't play no favorites. He give you what he give you, and he see what you do with it. So now they'd run and they'd picked that watermelon, but I'm here to tell you, watermelon don't make no kinda juice you wanna drink. Oh, you can squeeze a watermelon until you blue in the face, and I swear 'fore God you ain't got nothing in that cup but a mass of pulpy water. If I take this lemon that don't nobody want, I can use the zest of it, I can plant seeds, I can make a lemonade that will make a white men wanna pick cotton for free. Sometime it ain't about what you wanna be. It's about what you deserve. It's about who you are, what you are, and what you come for. So now the question ain't why am I here helping these poor male strippers? The question is why is Jesus helping me? And since he's gonna help me and take this little lemon I got and continue to make the greatest lemonade anybody's ever put their mouth on-- all hail The Bruce and his lemonade. I appreciate his example that he could take something unwanted and make somebody want it. I appreciate that now, and I'm ready to show somebody that no matter what they say now, you can take nothing and you can make something out of it now. Mmm! Ain't got nothin' but a lemon. Don't nobody want that? Yes, baby! It's the Trinity. The lemon, the sugar and the water. - Mm. - You put them together and you got a sweet elixir. Ain't about judging. It's about following the example. Doing what the book said do. So... when I was coming up, I just wanted somebody to help me, show me a way. See what I mean? Show me how to take nothing and make something out of it without making me compromise who the fuck I'm trying to be in my life. You understand what I'm saying? So that led me to be with people that didn't have nothing but just wanted something, you understand what I'm saying? It's a lemonade stand. We got lemons. We got lemons, but we need sugar and we need water. And when we get all that together now, we can make something delicious now. We can make money off of it, and a business can be spawned from this. This is the truth now. Let's be honest. Who wants to be surrounded all day by a handful of followers clutching at your garments, seeing what you fitting to do. I do. I ain't got no choice. That's the example, they said. He went there where didn't nobody need to be, and he got his followers, and he went out and told the truth. The truth is I love women, and women deserve to be entertained well. And what they want, that's what I want too. Why? Because that's what God want. He want women to be happy, and he wants men to please them. I'm here to make sure that happens. Now I ask you again, sir, ain't it time for you to get ready? I think you're right. To the lemons. ♪♪ [hip-hop] Up next is The Hang Man! [laughing] Okay. Come on, guys. What is this place? Oh, girl, don't worry about it. You'll see. Yes, girl, you are in for a big surprise.

Now I ask you, when someone in the sanctuary gets caught up, and that fire gets shot up in their bones, - Come on now. - and they start to dance! - Hah! Hah hah! - Hey! - Hah! Hah! Hey! - Go ahead, Pastor! Does anybody have a problem with that? - Just speak on it. - I don't think so! When the African warriors would find themselves preparing to go into battle, they would find themselves dancing. [congregation applauding] Huh! Hey! - Dance, Pastor! - Yes! I think it was James Brown that said, "Oww!" Huh! I got the what? Feeling! - Feeling! - Yeah! 'Cause they were finding a way to bring out the spirit, to bring out the love, to talk about that which the Father gave to us from deep inside of us. He gave us a heartbeat. He gave us a rhythm. He gave us a soul. Ha. - Hallelujah! - Yes, Pastor! I don't mind about my son dancing, because if he's doing something that God, the heavenly father, gave him insidehis body that made him rise up, he's giving glory to the Father. My lady, your knight in shining armor. You lied. You promised you'd never lie, and you did. I thought if I told you the truth, I'd lose you. I promise... it won't happen again. I'm sorry. My son has been working hard on his career. - [murmuring] - Yes, sir, yes, sir. You've seen him right here in the church perform. Yes, yes. He's brought great artists, and the other day, he was presented with a contract. - No! - Yes! Whoo! But let me tell you the best news about it! He's gonna take that money and he's gonna give it to this church so that we can finally own our property! Oh, my God! What? God is good. Whoo! Oh, yeah! Amen, my brother! Is God good? Whoo!
