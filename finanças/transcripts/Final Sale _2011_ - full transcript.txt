Okay, Ally, breathe in. And a nice slow breath out. That's great. One more time. I can't find that guy's cousin's phone number. Ryan! Ryan! Sorry, man. Sorry. I got to get going. All right. Well, go ahead, you know. Tell her good luck, all right? -Give her my best. -Will do. Doc. Please. I'm afraid it's not good news. Your kidney function isn't improving. Wait. I thought that by increasing the treatments, we would get more time. Not always. Again, I am... I'm sorry. Okay, what's next? Well, unless you have family or friends that we haven't tested. We've tried everyone. Then, I'm afraid, we're out of options. That's not good enough. I'm sorry. How long do I have? At best two months. Where are we on the donor list? It's a four-to-six-year wait. Unfortunately, not an option at this point. It's time to get your affairs in order. Hey... I'm not giving up. - See. - Frozen one. - That wasn't so bad. - Gracias. This could really be helpful to your families. Everything good? Everything is perfect. Great. Where are you right now? I'm right here. We fought... It just didn't go our way. No, we keep fighting till the end. -This is the end. -No. There's still time. -Ryan. -There's still time! Sorry. -So many things. -No, that's okay. All right. So, you're still going to get dinner out. Yeah. Okay, I forgot some things over in the office. Do you need anything? A new kidney. I'm scared. Me too. Enough tears. Tell me about this new guy. Ben. Ben is a good name. - It's not important. - Yes, it is. I need to get my looks in now. See if he's good enough for my little sis. He seems really thoughtful and... caring. He's really sweet. What does he do? He's a lawyer. Strike one. No, he's one of the good ones. He works at the DA's office. I'll have Ryan run a check on him. - Excuse me. - Here to see Doctor Hayworth. He's right that way. Doctor Jackson, meet Doctor Jones in the E.R. Ryan. I need a minute. Is Ally with you? No. Well, have a seat. There was an article in the news a while back. It was the UCLA scandal with the Yakuza crime boss who needed a kidney. Do you remember that? Yeah, but-- He bought his way to the top of the list, right? So, don't tell me that we're out of options. I need you to help me save my wife. Ryan... Twelve years in law enforcement. I have seen some things. I've learned. Tell me what you need. I have access to resources. You need money? Drugs? I can make things go away. Just tell me, what it's going to take? -Ryan, stop. -I know there's a way, -There's always a way. -Stop! You... you just have to have faith in the system. Are you kidding me? The system? The system is broken! She's got months not years. You said it yourself. You can't lose hope. Hope? We're past that, okay? It's time for action! Doc... please, I'm asking you for help. What you're asking me to do is unethical. Not to mention illegal. I'm sorry. There's nothing more that I can do. It's not over. No. I'm not giving up on her. I'm not saying that you should. Doctor Craig with Doctor Jackson... Hey, man! What do you want? I can help you. Your situation, I can help. You know I'm a cop, right? I know who you are... you and your wife. -Doctor Hayworth-- -Look, do you want help or not? -Yeah. Yes. -Okay. Call this number. They'll do what they can. Wait a minute. Who are you? Just call the number. Are you okay? Had some new meds. I'll get you some water. Here you go. I can't do this. What good are an extra couple weeks if they are like this? I can't. Maybe you don't have to. What if there was another option, Ally? We find the donor ourselves. Ryan... No. This isn't just about you, you know. I have a number. Let's just see what they have to say. That's all. We don't have to do it. Please, Ally. Just do this for me, okay? Okay. Thank you. - Mister Graves? - Yes. James Dolan. - Good to meet you. - Me, too. -Thank you. -My wife. James Dolan. It's very nice to meet you, Allison. Ally is fine. -Have a seat right here. -Thank you. So, how does this work? Straight to the point. Well you-- I'm sure you already know the stats. The thousands of people that die every year while waiting for a donor. You see, US law states that a donor must be a relative, a spouse, or donating for reasons of affection. Making what you do illegal. Well, let's just say it doesn't leave much wiggle room for people like yourself. People whose lives are literally on the line. My mother... passed away two days before my 18th birthday. A kidney disease. For five years, I watched... an exciting... vibrant woman be reduced to a shallower form of herself. We're sorry to hear that. I was top my class at Harvard Law. And, I I've learned the system from the inside out in hopes of changing it. And, when it comes to donating organs, let me tell you, the system is broken. I couldn't spend another day working in a system that shuts out people in need, like yourself... or my mother. I... I carried the anger of losing her inside of me for years, not knowing what to do. Now, let me do this. So, I don't regret it, not for a minute, because what I do actually makes a difference. Saves people's lives. How long does the process take? Well, first, we need to identify a match. And once that's done, we can go ahead and schedule your surgery. Well, how long does that take to identify a match? Well, I make no promises, but I'm fairly confident we can have your wife prepped and ready to go within the month. And it could be sooner, depending on availability. Doctor Hayworth said it would take months for me to climb the donor list. Now, you're sitting in my living room, telling me I could have transplant surgery within the month? What's wrong with this picture? Look, I'm sure your doctor is a fine man and a competent physician. And if you want to follow his advice, I say, "Go with God. But if you want to... if you want to dance at your daughter's wedding, bounce your grandchildren on your knee, and, for that matter, live to see your next birthday, I say, "Go with me." My company delivers a product to the consumer at a mutually agreeable price. It's a private, confidential transaction, contracted and executed right here in the United States. -Organs from the black market? -Ally! Well, no, no. It's okay. She's not wrong. Let me leave you with this thought. Within the next five to ten years, the laws for the organ trade will be revised. And this exact transaction will be legal. It would be a shame for you to sacrifice your life because of old ideas and defunct bureaucracy. Let me leave you with the paperwork for you to review. A few signatures is all we require to get started. It's a lot to think about and you really should sleep on it. Okay? Okay. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ally. -I'll walk you out. -Thank you. How much does it cost? Does that matter? I can't lose your Ally, please. I don't want to die. Then don't. Okay. I've got some great news. We have found a match. Rosa. Congratulations, Rosa, you just helped your entire family get into the country. Not the best part of town is it? No. This is actually a pretty safe neighborhood. I think this is it, up on the right here. Any trouble finding the place? No. I work the area. -Morning, Mrs. Graves. -Hi. Try to settle in and the doctor will be with you shortly. I'll be right back. Okay. Final installment? Hi, I'm Doctor Bowman. You must be Ally. -Hi. -Hi. - Mister Graves. - Yes. Hi, Doctor Bowman. -Hi. Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. So, you must be excited to start your new life. - But one thing at a time. - Not to worry. I've successfully performed this procedure literally hundreds of times. It's best for you both, if you just focus on all the wonderful moments that lay ahead. Any kids? -No. -Not yet. That's the spirit. We were about to start trying when I got sick. Well, in a few months, you'll be able to start right back up. We'll have you home before you know it. Shall we? We'll see you in there. Thank you. Thank you very much. I love you. I love you. All right. On the count of three. One, two, three. Now, nice and easy. Okay. Is that my donor? Yes, it is. Can I meet her? It's best if you don't. So, Ally, what, what were you doing? You know, before your kidneys failed? I was a researcher. Really? Interesting. What kind? Social Anthropology. I was about to go through the stages of your recovery, but I'm guessing that you... - Got them printed out at home. - Okay. Well, listen. You just take it easy. Nothing too physical for the first few months. All right? Anthony here is going to take care of your anesthetic and this will be over in a blink. Okay? No, no, no. No. Just relax. Just sit tight. - No... - Take it easy. We need to find the bleeder. BP's crashing. We're losing her. She's just bleeding out. Time of death? Does it really matter? No! It's okay. It's okay. It was just a dream. Did something go wrong with the operation? No, everything went smoothly. It was a huge success. I got a glimpse of the donor. She was so young. I'm sure she had her reasons. Now just try not to think about it, okay? What did you tell Kate? I pulled some strings and had you bumped up on the list. Okay. I made your appointment with Doctor Hayworth. Okay. Okay. We did the right thing. It's a nice work. I'm glad your husband found another option. Yeah, he's relentless. It's what makes him such a good detective. Don't you want to know where I got the kidney? No. The less I know the better. We're not crossing some ethical boundary here? I'm well within the law to treat you post-op. And, ethically, I'm just glad you're okay. Looks like you were in good hands. These meds... should help the kidney take. God, I don't care how you got to the top of the list. I'm just so thankful. Me, too. Ryan's a keeper. So what are you going to do once I'm better? You have to get a life. Funny! Come on. Let's go get you drugged up. All right. I got it from here. Okay. Are you sure? Yeah. Thank you. How did it go? It will be okay. - We're losing her. - She's just bleeding out! I just got a call. A Jane Doe. It's on you two slackers. Come on, Serge. You know, we got-- I've passed you over twice because of Graves' thing. Everyone else is loaded up. -It's out of my hands. -We got it, Serge. All right. Go down there. Get to it, guys. How do they always get here first? Hey, Princess! You coming? You guys worked hard. Cara, doing good? Say hello to your wife. Got enough pictures? - Time to take a break. - Thanks, Scott. Very ripe. She's been here a few days. Damn! She's young. Cause of death... A young Hispanic Jane Doe was uncovered late this afternoon, down an alley in East L.A. Police aren't ruling out homicide. However, the remains showed an incision indicating that she may have had surgery within the last 24 hours. Detectives are looking into the possibility of human organ trafficking as a motive. You've heard, right? About what? Don't be dense, the girl in the alley. It's all over the news. -You should be resting. -Ryan! -It has nothing to do with you. -Whose desk did it end up on? Mine. What did we do? We didn't do anything, Ally. Please just relax. Are you serious? We don't know anything yet. It's probably not even the same girl. Until we find somebody who can identify her body. I can. I can identify her. -Ally, stop. -Ryan, I saw her face. So, what if it is her? What can we do? I know you're playing naive just to calm me down. So, stop. Did she have the incision? Ally, we're not having this conversation. -But if it's her, we can help. -Enough! Do you realize the position that this puts me in? I'm not the one being naive here. -It doesn't matter? -It does to me! We can lose everything! It's not worth it, Ally. Tell that to the girl we killed. Ally, we can't bring her back, okay? So, just stop. Okay? Stop whatever it is that you think you need to do and let it go. I can't let it go. Her kidney is keeping me alive. What about her family? What do you want me to do? Send me a photo of her. If it's not her, I will stop. And if it is her? One step at a time. Fine. - Good morning. - Hey! Ryan's gone already? Yeah, he got an early start. He's making up for lost time. Hey, there's somewhere I need to go today. Are you free to drive me? Are you sure it's a good idea you leave the house? It's only been five days. Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good. A little exercise will do me good. Okay. Where are we going? I just want to check something out. Humor me. Pull up next to that hotel. No. Stay in the car. I'll be right out. -Ally, I'm not going to-- -Please. I'll be right out. Okay, fine. But I'm going on the record this is strange. On the record? Things must be going well with the lawyer. Funny! Just hurry up. I can't find the bleeder. This is really not good. Forceps. Hang on there, sweetie. We can get it. - Bleeding out. - We're doing everything we can. - More gauze. - BP's crashing. - - Come on, she's bleeding out! We're losing her. Time of death? Does it really matter? Can I help you? Actually, you can. I was here last week and there was this lovely old man behind the desk. Frank, yeah. But he doesn't work here anymore. Really? He retired. Okay. Did you need a room? Just a bathroom. -Around the corner. -Thanks. What's going on? I never should have agreed to it. To what? Ryan was so sure. Ally? There was a teenage girl found dead here a couple of days ago. It was on the news. She was my donor. I was so scared. I didn't want to die. And Ryan, he-- I wasn't ready. I know. But not like this. We killed her, Kate. -It's not your fault. -Yes, it was. No. Anyone in your shoes would have done the same thing. Doesn't make it right. This girl made the decision to donate. Okay? If it wasn't you, it would have been someone else. It just feels so wrong. Well, there's nothing you can do about it now. I have to find out how this happened. Ally, that sounds dangerous. This isn't helping. Okay? So, let's get you home. All right? Come on. This new guy you're dating... Ben. How do you think he'd react to learning about my situation? I don't know. Thanks for rushing the results. I'll just add that to the pile of favors you already owe me. Tell me about the incision on her side. Missing a kidney and they nicked her lung causing a collapse. Then she bled out. That's a botched transplant? It's more common than you think. Any other identifying marks? No. This one's young. No ink, scars. -Nothing. -How old? Late teens. Sixteen, seventeen. Um, thank you. Thanks. What's with him? It's okay. His wife is just going through renal failure. Would you do me a favor? Just send those to us, okay? Ryan! What is all this? -He is covering his tracks. -Who? His real name is not James Dolan. The real James Dolan from Harvard, he died six years ago, in a car accident. Yeah. So it's an alias, Ally. I called that number. The line is dead. He had the concierge at the hotel fired. The rooms are totally cleared out. Ally, tell me you didn't go to the hotel. -I didn't drive. Kate took me. -We talked about this. You're supposed to be focusing on your recovery. -It's the same girl! -I don't care! Stop it. Ryan, she's not the only one this has happened to. That's right. She is not the only one that this has happened to because this sort of thing happens, Ally. These things happen. They happen. I see it every day. They don't happen to us! Why is it so hard for you to realize that the further you dig, the deeper the trouble we get into? Leave it alone. Please. You know me better than that. I'm not going to leave this alone. Then, it'll be the end of us, Ally. Think about that. Doctor Ivanesic, dial extension 3-0-0-4. Come in. Hey! I was surprised when you called. I thought we weren't meeting until next week. This couldn't wait. So you said some complications. In a manner of speaking. I don't follow. Well, the kidney seems to be taking, but... I just can't come to terms with how it all came to be. Dealing with these desperate situations day after day must be... really frustrating. I'm sorry, Ally. I'm still not following you. Watching your patients die year after year because of some out-of-date bureaucracy. It's not my favorite part of the job. So, every now and then, when you come across a particularly desperate couple, or say, husband, it makes sense that you would do what you did. I might have done the same. Which is? Don't play me, Doctor Hayworth. I know you guided my husband to James Dolan. Who? James Dolan, the broker who sold us the kidney? Ally, if you think that I had anything to do with how you got your kidney, then you've been sadly misinformed. This is the young girl whose kidney is now inside of me. She couldn't have been more than seventeen. -That's awful. -Yes, it is. I can't live with myself. How do you do it? I'm not sure what you want from me? I want to make sure this doesn't happen again. I have nothing to do with this. My husband came to you. And I told him I couldn't help him. You expect me to believe that? It's the truth. Ask him. All right. I know about Dolan's fake identity, the hotel. It's just a matter of time before I uncover the rest. I wish I could help. I'm building a case with the District Attorney. So, you're going to have to decide which side you're going to end up on. Think about it. -Don't forget your folder. -Keep it. Orderly to receiving. Orderly to receiving. We're supposed to be saving lives. What is this? -What the hell happened? -I'll look into it. Okay? I'll take care of it. Just keep your cool. Relax. You know that's a waste of time. These organs come in from all over the world. Yeah. I know. Homicide. Yeah. Really? Okay. Okay. Yeah, thanks. I think they got an ID on the Jane Doe. How about that? Diego. He got it. I'll take it. All right. Thanks. May I help you? Hi. No, I was just looking around. For anything in particular? No. I thought I saw a woman come in here who I know. A woman? Yeah. With brown hair, very pretty. Perhaps if you had a name. Pardon me for asking, but are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Well, I can have someone take a look at that for you. No, no, no, really. I'm fine. I should go anyway. Okay. Feel free to stop by anytime. Our doors are always open. Thank you. That was the Graves woman. -What did she want? -She's snooping around. She must have followed Anthony from the hospital. What do we do? I'm going to call Dolan. Damn it! Ally. Yeah, I'll be right out. Hey, did you get my message? -No. Sorry my phone was off. -It's okay. It's great to finally meet you, Ben. You too. I've heard a lot about you. Yeah. -Hi. -Hi. Come on in. Please, sit down. Can I get you anything? - No. I'm fine, thank you. - Okay. So, Kate's given me a brief overview of your situation. This conversation has to be completely off the record. The less details I know the better. All right. My goal is to bring the broker to justice. Without involving yourself or your husband, who's a detective, right? Yes. I'm not concerned about myself, but the less he's involved the better. But I'm going to need first-hand evidence implicating broker, sellers, and a complete understanding of the infrastructure to build a proper case. Yeah. I'm working on that. I'm sorry. Isn't that more your husband's area of expertise? I'm just gathering some data being as I am the one who went through the process. Of course. You know, there may also be some considerations for testifying and helping the city put the case together. I could send you over some basic legal guidelines. You could sit down with your family and discuss how you want to move forward. Thanks, Ben. Well, let's just let you get some rest then. - Yeah. - Okay. Thank you again. -My pleasure. -It's a pleasure. Let me know if you need anything. Okay? I will. I will. I will. Thank you. He's cute. Hey, you! Hey, sorry. Go back to sleep. It's okay. Nice choice of reading materials. How was your day? Not great. What happened? This thing that we did, I... I don't know how to-- It's just always there. It's 'cause you're one of the good guys. Her name is Rosa Garcia. Seventeen. Her father came in and identified her body today. It broke my heart. Why did he let her do it? I don't know. He's not talking. I know it's hard for you, but I have to do something. I understand. You shouldn't have to do it alone. So, why don't you show me everything you have and we'll do it together. Thank you. I know. Most of my research is in a folder on the coffee table. Okay. I'll bring it in to work tomorrow. See what I can do. I think it all centers around a church near Huntington Park. Church? Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's a cover. Okay, get some rest. I'll be right in. So? She's been doing some digging? -Not the husband? -Doesn't seem like it. She was alone at the hospital. It won't be good for him if this came out. She says she's working with the DA on this. -Seriously? -That's what Anthony says. I'll find out. Well, what should we do? Business as usual. It's time to pay Mrs. Graves a follow-up visit. -Good morning. -Good morning. This is pretty thorough stuff. I'm off. -I'll check in this afternoon. -Okay. I want another one. One more. Mister Dolan. Beautiful morning, isn't it? I wasn't expecting you. Standard follow-up. Just want to make sure everything's taking. Do you mind? Don't mind my associate. Can I get you anything? Tea? Coffee? No, no. We're fine. - Excuse the mess. - Please. So, how are you feeling? I'm doing well. Getting stronger and stronger each day. Excellent! Now, have you been to see the doctor to get the proper prescription? Yes. Because most of these won't take without the proper medication. I'm covered. Thanks. Good. Wow! Do you remember what it was like when you had no hope and no alternatives? Such a scary place. I mean, that makes you realize how important it is to be... to be grateful for what we have. -Don't you agree? -I do. Well, then. Everything is as it should be. Another satisfied customer. No wait. There is just one little thing we need to clear off. And I'll speak plainly so there can be no misunderstanding. Accidents happen. That's all this was. Now, an accident can be tragic and difficult to deal with, but it's called an accident because it's out of our control. Unfortunately, it's the price of doing business. Understand? Good. So, no more digging, no more threatening the people, who helped save your life. It's so disrespectful. The DA. Really? Well, we both know that's a lie. Consider this a warning. Okay? Good. You should focus on your recovery. Forget the past. Look to the future. Okay. Well, then. I think we've taken up enough of your time. You have a wonderful rest of the day. What are you doing? I thought this was something else. It's not. You've been looking through it all morning. Maybe. Seems like there is a little something to do with our case. Is there something you want to tell me? No. Not really. We got company here. This guy's dressed too nice to be a cop. -Detective Graves? -Yeah. ADA Martin. Can I have a word? We'll go right on out there. Kate brought me over to have a conversation with Ally. Look, you're so far gone, you don't even know who you're dealing with. What? The Milano crime family. James Dolan is Dominic Pino, a major earner. We've had him in our sights for years. You've seen one of his operations from the inside. Find someone you can flip and we'll do everything we can to keep you and your wife out of it. All right. Hey. Thank you. So? There's something I have to tell you. Nothing. Thanks. How'd you find me? I looked up the bars closest to your place. You know there are two that are much closer. I like the ambiance. Does that help with the guilt? Ask me in an hour. What went wrong? This can't be worth it. -What do you want? -I need your help. Lady, my job is done. She was only seventeen. This has got to stop. Now that you have your kidney, of course. If I could do it again... -I'd-- -Have died. If it wasn't you, it would have been someone else. I have to do something. I'm sorry, I can't help you. Everyone keeps telling me to look to the future. Good advice. You should do the same. This is going down, one way or another, that I can guarantee. You need to decide what side you want to end up on when it does. Wait. I could use some fresh air. - Excuse me. - Hey, pal! We got a match. We just got to find a doctor. I got the word out. Look, she's coming too. Hey, hey! Welcome back, Ally. You want to scream? Go ahead. Get it out of your system. My husband is a cop. No. You'll be gone long before he ever finds you. Hey, Doc! How long before this organ rejects without the meds? Answer the question. How long? Could happen anytime. Now, don't you go dying on me? -You have a good kidney-- -Okay. That's enough. I'll tell you when it's enough. Well, we've got work to do. Ally! Baby, I've been calling you all day. Ally! No! No, no. What did you do? Hey, Ryan. Hi. Kate, is Ally with you? - No. -Do you know where she is? She's not at home? Ryan, what's going on? I don't know. She's not answering her cell phone. Bowman. Are you all right? Yeah. Where do you think we are? Does it matter? Excuse me, I'm looking for Doctor Hayworth. He's not here anymore. I don't understand. Was his office moved? No. He was transferred, I think. There was a nurse, an orderly. His name was Anthony. Anthony? He is a tall guy, closely cropped hair about this high. I don't think we ever had an Anthony working here. Do you know where Dr. Hayworth was transferred to? That's admin's department. You can check with them in the morning. All right. This is James Dolan's known addresses. Any of these addresses pop, let me know. That's what I'm passing on. Alrighty. Thank god! Do we know anything? -No. Not yet. Thanks, guys. -What do you want us to do? We need to find James Dolan. We'll focus on the out-of-the-way places. The warehouses, the docks. We're going to take the top two. Yeah. That's good. We'll focus on East LA. Perfect. Guys, listen to me. This is a potential hostage situation. If anything seems strange or off, call it in. Come on. Let's go find her. Nothing. You just couldn't leave it alone. Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a good doctor? I mean, all you had to do is look the other way and none of this would have happened. But you had to keep prying. Still viable? Yeah. This won't end with me. The wheel's just going to keep on turning. Don't think I've not been through this before, Ally. My husband has all the information I gathered. He will expose you. Yeah. Your husband's going to hit a long list of dead ends. No pun intended. Got a new doctor. Well, that wasn't as hard as I thought. Perfect. Prep her. The new doctor can whip out this organ and we can have this done before lunch. Okay. Well, Ally. Looks like you're going to get your wish. We're going to take back the organ. Then you can clear that overbearing conscience of yours. May we help you? Shots fired in a church near Huntington Park. Shots fired. All units in the area respond. Repeat. Shots fired. -They said the church. -What church? Ally said it all centered around a church. Come on. Let's go! I was almost frightened for my life. I mean I've never seen anything like it. You know, I'm... We'll take it from here. Thanks. Detective Ryan Graves. My partner, Detective Nelson. Detectives. That's right. We were in the area when we heard the call from Dispatch. So, why don't you walk me through exactly what happened here? So, he didn't say anything? He just... He walked in mumbling something that sounded like a Lord's Prayer. Then he just opened fire. Miracle nobody got hurt. Thank, God! What are these doors to here? This one here, that's to the basement. We have just bake sales and neighborhood programs. That sort of thing. Shh. Ryan, come on. Let the unit handle it. One of these Dolan's addresses is actually in the neighborhood. Let's check this out. We'll put a call into the station. We'll get the number for that church that Ally has in her files. Yeah, okay. - Thank you, Father. - Thank you. Thanks, Father. And go with God. - Hey, Ryan. - Surround the building. This is the place. She's here. Call for back-up. Go around the side. No one comes out. Freeze! Hey, come on! Open! Come on in! They are coming. It's over! SWAT is on the way. God. It's going to be okay. Put your guns down. She's dead if you don't. All right. Everyone just stay calm. We are all getting out of here or she dies. No. This isn't going down how you want it to. What the hell are you doing? Get down. Now! Easy. What took you so long? I'm sorry. -I need my meds. -I know. I know. I got you. I got you. Okay, sit down right here. They're going to take a look at you. Okay? Who is that? He's Diego Garcia. He's Rosa's father. What's he doing in the back of the car? Mister Garcia, could you come out please? Watch your head. Okay. Hey, listen to me. Don't worry about him, okay? You just worry about getting better. Ally! I'm so sorry about your daughter, Rosa. Rosa. If I could go back, I would trade my life for hers. I'm so sorry. Mister Garcia... you're free to go. Just leaving? That's right. Paging, Doctor Greenberg. Report... Shouldn't you be on work? And miss all the excitement? Besides, I get the feeling that I can't leave you alone... for a second. Inappropriate. Come on. Let's get you home. Thanks, Doc. Thank you. In local news, the DA's office made a breakthrough in the kidnapping of a Los Angeles woman which led police to uncover an international organ trafficking ring. Deputy District Attorney, Ben Martin, is prosecuting the case against Dominic Pino. We'll prosecute the case to the fullest extent of the law. Our evidence is overwhelming and we will be charging Mr. Pino with multiple counts of murder, trafficking, mayhem and kidnapping. That's all we have, folks. Isn't he cute? He's all right, for a lawyer. What's the matter? Nothing.
