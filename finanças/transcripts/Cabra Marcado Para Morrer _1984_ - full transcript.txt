"As he followed the restoration process of 'Man Marked for Death', Eduardo Coutinho said the names of Luiz Carlos Bresser-Pereira, Carlos Augusto Calil and Celso Amorim should be acknowledged for their contribution to the making of the film in 1984, which could not be done at the time." MAN MARKED FOR DEATH, 20 YEARS LATER It is an underdeveloped country, underdeveloped Underdeveloped, underdeveloped Underdeveloped, underdeveloped country And, after the colonial period, the country became... April, 1962. These images were shot during UNE-Volante, a congress held by the National Union of Students, who travelled the country promoting discussions about higher education reform. The students travelled with members from the CPC, the UNE's Popular Cultural Centre. Their intention was to encourage the creation of similar local cultural centres in other states. Images of poverty contrasted with emblems of imperialism. This was a typical cultural tendency in those days, as "A Song of Underdevelopment", a classic song by the CPC, shows very well. As a member of the CPC and the one who was in charge of filming, I also paid tribute to the nationalism of the day. I went to Alagoas to film at an oilfield that Petrobras was starting to explore. After being in Pernambuco, UNE-Volante arrived in Paraíba on April 14th. Two weeks before that João Pedro Teixeira, founder and leader of the Sapé Peasant Workers' League, had been murdered. The day after we arrived, a rally was held in Sapé in protest at his murder, about 30 miles from the capital João Pessoa. Elizabeth Teixeira, João Pedro's widow, was there with six of their eleven children. The peasants assembled in front of the headquarters of the Rural and Farmworkers' Association, known as the Peasant League. At that time, the Sapé League was the largest in the Northeast, with more than seven thousand members. The League had been registered three years before as a civil corporation in private law. Since forming a rural union was actually impossible, the farm workers founded leagues the only legal way to channel their demands. Elizabeth Teixeira was 37 years old. João Pedro died when he was 44. Before the peasants went to the rally, I made my first contact with Elizabeth. I briefly interviewed her at the League's headquarters. The issues of land occupation taxes, compulsory unpaid work, uncompensated evictions, the use of violence by major landowners. In the struggle against all this, João Pedro had united the region's peasants. It was this day, that I had the idea of making a feature film about the life of João Pedro Teixeira. I would call it "Man Marked for Death". Produced by the UNE's CPC, and Pernabuco's Movement for Popular Culture, MCP, the film was to be shot at the same locations with the same people who lived this story. Elizabeth and her children would play themselves. "Peasants from Sapé Hold Their First Protest Rally" Two years later, we were ready to start filming. But on January 15th, 1964, there was a violent incident near Sapé. The police and the guards from the sugar mill clashed with the peasants. 11 died in the conflict. The area was occupied by the Paraiba Military Police, making it impossible for us to shoot there. The emergency forced me to move the film's location. I found the perfect spot at the Galileia sugar mill in Pernambuco, where the first Peasant League had been formed in 1955. When we got to Galileia, in the municipality of Vitória de Santo Antão, about 30 miles from the capital Recife, we began to prepare for filming. With the League's permission and cooperation from the locals, we chose the locations and the actors. On February 26th, 1964, when we shot the first scenes of "Man Marked for Death", we were helped by those peasants who were not controlled by landowners and who could dedicate their time to working on the film. After struggling for four years, they now owned their own land, that ended in the expropriation of Galileia. João Mariano, who played João Pedro Teixeira, was not from Galileia. After being fired from the sugar mill where he used to work, he had moved to Vitória de Santo Antão. As he was a Protestant like João Pedro, João Mariano was hired along with five of his children. We were supposed to use these images of the Teixeira family going back from the town to the country with the opening credits. From the original intention of shooting with people portraying themselves, Elizabeth Teixeira, was in fact the only person to play herself. She travelled with us from Paraíba to Pernambuco. On April 1st, 35 days after the start of the shooting, filming was stopped by the military coup of 1964. Only 40% of the script had been shot. Galileia was raided by the Army and the principal local peasant leaders were arrested. Some members of the crew were also arrested, but most of us managed to escape to Recife and then on to Rio de Janeiro. Film equipment, negatives, unedited film, magnetic tape, copies of scripts and documentation were all confiscated. But most of the film negative that we had already shot was safe, because it had already been sent to the lab in Rio de Janeiro to be developed. We also saved eight stills, kept by a member of the crew. Finally, after two years, I got a copy of the script back. It had been rescued in August, 1964, by a lawyer working for the Paraíba peasant leagues from the place she had been held prisoner. February, 1981. 17 years later, I went back to Galileia to finish the film in whatever way I could. There was no planned script. I just wanted to find the peasants who had worked on "Man Marked for Death". I wanted to hear their stories from the past, including the ones concerning the disrupted filming, the real story behind João Pedro's life, the struggle in Sapé, the struggle in Galileia. I also wanted to know what had happened to the people in the film during the intervening years. Only two of the peasants who started the struggle for Galileia. are still alive. José Hortêncio da Cruz and João Virgínio Silva, who doesn't know how to read or write and is the living memory of the group. Our first meeting... there was him... his brother-in-law... his nephew and me. We were here, talking... Right here, in this very place. I told them my story, the ideas I had of founding a society to work for the people and those already deceased. The dead used to be buried in a coffin that the mayor kept in his office. He would lend it to us, we'd bury the dead in the ground and take the coffin back to the mayor's office. The coffin was called "Lolo". We borrowed it from the mayor so that we could bury the dead. Galileia was a disused sugar plantation which had been split into small lots. 150 tenant families lived there, growing subsistence crops. The owner of the plantation lived in Recife. The families had a lease and paid annual rent. The raise in rents was one of the reasons for the creation of the League. We got together, we started to hold meetings. We held them on the side of the road, by the weir, at my house. Everywhere! Then we got to the room of this lad's father's house. Old Zezé's living room. When old Zezé allowed me to hold our first meeting in his living room, we stated our goals and came up with a name: The Charitable Society for the Dead and the Pernambuco Planter's Agricultural Society. Because back then, we couldn't call anything a union otherwise we'd be in trouble. We'd be killed. José Francisco de Souza (Zezé da Galileia) was a highly respected man who had administered the sugar mill for over 30 years, and was elected president of the League. The owner of Galileia decided to evict all the tenants when he realised the League was not only for the dead, but also aimed to improve conditions for the tenants. So, the tenants looked for a lawyer, to defend their rights. That was how I sought justice. I didn't find it in Vitória, so I went to the State Courts. The Chairman of the Courts... gave me his deputy, Julião. Julião came, took over the fight, and made it work. When things began to improve, people got excited and started pouring in. All of those who'd been evicted from the sugar mill, came for help. There's a society in Galileia that protects the rights of the country workers. The lawyer was really tough. So, you see? So, the men came... And when they got here, we offered them shelter. After four years, when the owner gave up, he made out he was going to sell the property. So we went to the deputy, and he said, "I'll file it for discussion before the Chamber and see what we can do about it." There was a set-to! They put up a real fight! One of them would shout, "Fellows... "we can't expropriate Galileia "because this is not about expropriating one Galileia, "but expropriating many Galileias, "because the idea will spread like wildfire "across Brazil, from the north to the south. "Because these people will get hooked on the idea, they will, "they'd organise and force the Judicial Power to purchase other properties." But fortunately, we won. Fortunately. Fortunately, the deputies voted in our favour. The expropriation of Galileia for reasons of social interest was carried out in December, 1959, after a fair financial compensation, as the Constitution demands. Galileia then became a symbol of the peasant movement. But the families still don't have the deeds to this day. Right after we arrived in Galileia, we managed to show the community what we had shot in 1962 and 1964. The actors were our special guests. José Daniel do Nascimento, 67 years old, moved to Galileia after being evicted from a neighbouring mill. One of his children was sucking on a piece of sugarcane without the master's approval. Brás Francisco da Silva, 52 years old, was one of the leaders in the struggle for Galileia. He doesn't live here anymore. He had to flee in 1964 and is now rarely seen. This man talking to João Virgínio is Bia, 56 years old, who left Galileia in 1975 and never came back. He's a night watchman at a quarry. João Mariano Santana da Silva, 59 years old, who played the part of João Pedro, had not been to Galileia since 1964. He only meets these people rarely at the street market in Vitória de Santo Antão, where he lives. João Mariano has brought his grandchildren along. We showed it exactly as it had been filmed -- out of order, with incomplete scenes, repeated scenes, clapperboards, etc. Don't talk about him, cos he's back there! Saturday evening was the only time we could get them all together. Some had come a long way to see the show. That's Mariano, isn't it? Yeah, that's Mariano. Yeah! I recognise him! That's Mariano. Look at him! What intrigued them the most, was identifying the people in the film, 17 years younger. - Are they gonna fight? - Christ! They're fighting! He's the boss... Zé Daniel still lives in Galileia. He was our actor, and his house was our main set: João Pedro's house. Did you enjoy watching the film on Saturday? On Saturday? It was really good. What did you think about it? I thought it was very good. Very interesting. Because... what we all did for this work -- When did you become a Protestant? After the revolution. Wasn't it on April 1st? Yes... On May 25th, that same year... I gave myself to Jesus, and I am still His... What church do you attend? The Baptist Church? Assembly of God. Look at Braz! That's Braz over there! You remember when we made the film? Oh, I do, because we had such a good time making it. And what did you think about it? It was good. But I missed the sound. Braz Francisco da Silva is the only one of the actors who prospered. On his 4-hectare plot of land, he grows vegetables that he sells in Recife. Six of his children live in São Paulo, and three neighbours help him with the work. Working hard in the fields since he was 8 years old, Braz admits he's tired and wants to sell his land. Do you really want to sell it? I do. If anyone wants to buy it. Do you want to buy it? Who? Me? How much do you want for it? I'll take 3 million for it. 3 million cruzeiros or up. Braz, known as João to his neighbours, fled Galileia in 1964, and changed his name to avoid persecution. Disillusioned with political activities, Braz no longer likes Galileia and he doesn't want to remember the struggles of the past. Yeah, that's Cícero! Look, that's Cícero! He's all the way down south and we're seeing him here. Yeah, show us more! Limeira, rural São Paulo. Cícero Anastácio da Silva. When did you start working here? On May 5th, last year. What do you do here? Iron rolling. Why did you come down south? I was working back there, I had a job. But then I lost my job and was unemployed for six months. I moved south last year, in March. Are you happy working here? Have you got used to it? How is it? I'm all right, I'm happy. No one is mad at me. My fellow workers, the bosses... They all like my work, they don't say anything against me. But don't you want to go back? I want to go back. I'd like to very much. It is very cold here. My wife doesn't like the cold. If I could send her back home, I would. Back north, I had places to go, people to talk to. I had the League, where we took charge of things. We used to talk about how to make things happen. But I've got no one here. The only thing I have is a television set. So I can watch the news, because I like to watch it and know what's going on. That's all I like to watch. As the only actor from Galileia who could read and write, Cícero was also a production assistant for the film. What are your memories of the film? What I remember is... the scene I did roofing that house. The other asked me, and I said, "Dried meat's so expensive. How are we supposed to live?" I picked up a tile... and I handed it over to the fellow on the roof. Roofing the house. And he said to me... And I answered, "Dried meat's so expensive. How are we supposed to live?" Did you ever hope we would go back and finish the film? I was always hopeful you would go back and finish the film. I used to think about it. My late mother would say, "They're not coming back, my son." I'd say, "They are, Mum. You won't see it if you die, but you will if you live." - Elizabeth Teixeira, right? - So it is! Look at her! Although they hadn't seen Elizabeth Teixeira since 1964, the actors recognised her immediately. Elizabeth had disappeared 17 years before. Not even her family and peers at the Sapé League knew where she had gone. Abraão, her eldest son, was the only one who knew. I went looking for Abraão in Patos, in rural Paraíba, where he's a journalist. After making many demands, he agreed to take the film crew to his mother's house. We went to the border with Paraíba and entered Rio Grande do Norte, without knowing exactly where we were being taken. After a four-hour trip and taking back roads in bad conditions, we glimpsed a small town in the middle of nowhere, down by the Piranhas River. São Rafael was a good hideout. About 180 miles from Sapé and 310 miles from Galileia, the town has a population of under three thousand and there's no TV reception there. Elizabeth lived in São Rafael with her son, Carlos, the only child she took with her. She had changed her name to Marta Maria da Costa. Elizabeth wasn't expecting me. I started our conversation by showing her the remaining eight stills from the film. Yes. How did you get these? This was what we managed to save. The photographer had hidden them. I'm surprised. I thought they had destroyed everything. They took the original, but not the copy. I mean: the original was in Rio. They got the copy in -- Mum, do you recognise President Figueiredo's re-democratisation? Yes. President Figueiredo-- We're here thanks to him. Thanks to him, I'm here today with you. The only Government that deserves our gratitude, for having given the right for all political prisoners who had fled Brazil, to come back to their families. And now I am... here with my son seeing you again, Coutinho. I never expected to see you today in my house. Who should we thank for this? Right...? My hope, I had no hope left... of even seeing my children again. I was afraid. I suffered a lot! I suffered. You are my witnesses. I suffered a lot. The persecution was too great. They tried very hard... to get rid of me. Have you been living here for very long? Yes, 16 years. You came here 16 years ago? 16 years. After all that happened, I fled and I managed to get here. Things got really nasty. They looked for me everywhere. I couldn't stay in Recife. After I got here, things got better in terms of the persecution. I hid. No one knew who I was. No one knew who I was. Now, everyone in this room knows! You all know. When I came here, I didn't say I had children. After I made some friends, I would tell them, "I have children, I'm a widow, my husband was murdered." But before that I kept quiet. But before I wouldn't say anything. I was silent, haunted. But thank God I'm here today, telling you this story. And João Alfredo and Pedro the farmer... these... They... Tell us... Mum, I'm not trying to influence your views on politics. But all regimes are the same, if a person has no political protection. They're all... they're all harsh, violent, arbitrary. Regardless of class and economic background. All political factions have forsaken Elizabeth Teixeira, simply because she had no power. This is the disgust of her eldest son. Now, if you don't register my protest, my vehemence, the missing truth, the intellectual and expressive capacity... of my mother's heart. I'll record everything the family wants to say. But I want the film to show... our rejection of any form of government! It will, I guarantee it. No political system helps the poor. None. That's Abraão to the left. I was thin, in black. That same night, we showed Elizabeth, her two sons and her neighbours, the old footage. There's Elizabeth planting peanuts! Abraão watched it without saying a word. This one played my husband. The boys are happy...! Ah, my God...! Is that her family? No, they were playing the parts! This is us, on our way to our second day of shooting with Elizabeth Teixeira. Out of a total of three days. On the first day, Abraão made his presence felt, affecting the interview, especially at the beginning. He didn't show up for the following days. Elizabeth told us about her life with João Pedro in two stages: with and without Abraão. In her living room and in her backyard. Is Elizabeth in? Come here, Elizabeth. How's the class going? They're inside, this group of children. Hi! How are you, Coutinho? How's class going? It's good, but the children aren't all here. Today's the first day. They're going to meet the teachers today, so they're not all here. Do you want to come in? Come on in. All right, we're going to check if the light's good enough. All right! How do you like the town? It's nice. Coutinho, last night I lay in bed thinking. I said, "I didn't speak very well in the interview." Yesterday, I was very emotional as well. You end up feeling... and you get all... Because I should've told you everything from the beginning. How we met, got married and moved to Jaboatão. If we had filmed it today, I would have been more accurate. We can do it again today. You have a backyard, right? Yes. Come take a look. OK. Elizabeth, who stopped studying as a second grader, was giving reading and writing classes, to a group of local children. Do you remember the year you got married? The year...? Forty... two! And how did you meet João Pedro de Teixeira? I met him in my father's store. He was buying there. Then, we started courting, and eventually we got married. Did your father oppose the marriage? He did! Is it true you had to elope because he didn't approve? How did it happen? We eloped and got married. My father never agreed to the marriage. I eloped. And so you got married and moved to the Massangana sugar mill? Massangana! - João Pedro went to work there? - He did. - What did he do? - He worked at the quarry. - At the plantation? - On the plantation land. - When did you go to Cavaleiro? - To Cavaleiro? 1945! Things were going bad, so we moved to Cavaleiro. He worked at a quarry... over there, in the outskirts of Recife. Then João Pedro and Manoel Serafim became friends. They were neighbours and they went to the same Baptist church, and worked at the same quarry. Manoel Serafim still works there and still lives in Cavaleiro, a district of Jaboatão, Recife. He was not very dark, fairly light, with wild curly hair... yes, rather wild. He had rather wiry hair. Rather wiry. He was built like this. He was strong. His face was wider, and this was a bit higher. A round face, and his forehead was... like people say... he had a good man's features. A person you rely on. A high forehead, without being bald. - Was he lively? - He was strong! He had a body like this, if not stronger, a bit stronger than him. Muscular... muscular arms. We lived in Recife. In Recife, he started to get into politics. After joining the workers' union... - At the quarry? - The workers at the quarry. When I was in Cavaleiro he already had those ideas. Those political ideas of his. Always on the workers' side. He was dedicated to the workers, he fought for the unions, and for the workers' rights. So, they stopped hiring him at the quarries. They started clamping down, put pressure on him and he left. When he left... he went to Paraíba. And he became president of the Land Workers' League. Then, I told him, "There's some dangerous men up there. It'll come to a bad end." He said, "I'll tell you this, I don't want to die, "but I'm not afraid of being shot, for what I believe in." And he said it like this, "I may be shot dead up there, "but it's better than starving to death down here! It's better than starving to death down here." So, Dad sent for us. Once we got there, he managed to set up the League. He started to organise the Land Workers' League in 1958. 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961. In 1962 he was murdered. What was the farm like? Was it your father's? The farm we lived on was Dad's. It was Dad's. - How big was it? - I don't know how many acres. - Was it small? - Yes, it was small. Did João Pedro know how to write? Yes, he did. He knew how to read and write. A bit. Had he always been a Protestant? No. - He became one later? - Later. - In Jaboatão? - Yes. In Jaboatão he dedicated himself to it there. He spent a long time at it. Then he dedicated himself to politics. He concentrated on the League and abandoned his church. Until one day, when he was arrested by the Army. They asked him a lot of things about the Bible. And he knew everything! "So your ideas are really those of a Protestant! You can answer all my questions." You stayed a Catholic? Yes, always. - You never argued over religion? - No, never! - He was OK with it? - He would say... he wouldn't baptise the children. They'd be pagan. I was fine with it. It wasn't a problem. He worked in the fields. He lived in the fields, and he worked the fields. And in his free time? In his free time, at night, on Saturdays and Sundays he was out, or the workers would come over to the house. Then he would discuss with them, and he'd ask them how they were surviving. Others came to complain they were being evicted, that the owner wanted them to leave. That they should have rights over their land. He told them, "Friends, we must unite. "If we are united, "we can end this tradition, "of the owner taking our land. "But, unless we unite... they will keep on doing this, and that's that!" Market day was meeting day. He would go to the market and talk to the workers. And I worked at the League stamping cards, signing them, asking who wanted to join, for how long and how much they were going to pay. In this scene from "Man Marked for Death" a group of peasants led by João Pedro were arguing with the administrator over rent increases. The dialogue was created by the actors themselves, after they improvised prior to filming. What's going on? You shouldn't have come here together! When it's time to pay the rent, only one of you needs to come. This makes you look bad. I'll change your housing situation. You're too close to one another. We pay on time, but you're asking for too much! João Pedro, you're the leader! You came up with these ideas! He's not the leader. But according to the agreement, he can make a reasonable appeal for all of us. We have no choice in the matter. I'm very upset with you about all of this! You're upset? You shouldn't be! If your son dies, I bury him. If your wife gets sick, I put her in a hospital. You have everything you need! We're not convinced! You need to try harder! You're not thinking straight, you don't seem to have any sense! You're half-witted. You're a brute! You make things bad for yourself! Let's settle this! Can't you see the owners don't die? The administrators don't die. Only the peasants die! We don't want to fight with you, but we can't afford to pay. You know you're mine and I am yours. I want you to be satisfied. I don't want to fight! This land is all ours! But I can't cancel the increase in rent. I can only do that when the boss comes back from the capital, in a week's time. I have to do as the boss tells me. Well, it can wait a week, can't it? According to what his answer is, then we'll decide. Let's think about it. Life is sweet. Go home, talk to your families. Stop this nonsense. We're together in this. So, we'll come back next week to hear his answer. One day, mark my words, the day will come... when you will no longer be able to do this! So, your father had a quarrel with João Pedro. Yes. And Dad said he wanted his land back. He wanted to take back what was rightfully his. I tried to reason with him. He said it wasn't working out. Then, Dad got really mad at him. We had some cattle at home. Dad had sent the cattle for us to tend to. To look after the milking. So, Dad took the cattle back and sold the farm to Antônio Vítor, so we were forced to leave. Dad used to say, "He should get your own land and live on it!" It was all very unfair. Why unfair? They used to kill the land workers. They were thrown out without any rights. There was persecution. People were persecuted. You couldn't even go out to work. Persecuted... We saw people die. It was so unfair that families were left abandoned in the fields. While they took over the plantations. Alfredo wasn't a leader. He was a member of the League. He was tough. He was a fighter... and he was very long suffering, because of Pedro Ramos, who put him under a lot of pressure. Until one day he was working in the field, and the landowner... the landowner's hired thugs arrived. They beat him and shot him dead. And when they threw stones at the door, you sang, right? They threw stones, they banged on our door and called for him to come out. They said the lawyer was there, waiting for him. Do you remember the "Coco" song you used to sing? - I do! - How did it go? He was arrested many times by the police. He made it easy. One day when I was teaching the children. They were sitting at the table and he was sitting outside on the porch, bare-chested, when a group of policemen arrived! A lot of them. And he couldn't do anything. Nothing, nothing, nothing! They took him, bare-chested and all. He believed in the struggle. The landowners offered him money, so that he'd give up the fight. They offered him another way to survive. I remember this day and night. The things he had to go through. But he never gave in. He never came home and said, "Elizabeth, I regret it!" That, never! He stood strong! He said, "I'll organise a rally on Saturday." I said, "It's impossible to organise a rally." He said, "I will!" I said, "Count me in!" He got into a jeep and spread the word around the farms. And that day we held the biggest protest rally of all. He knew the landowners would kill him. One day I asked him, "João Pedro, we need to leave this state. "We can't do this anymore. It's too difficult. "These men come by, and say the landowners "will kill you. "They say the day that you're killed... "they'll cut off your ear and drink it with cãna. "This is no good! We have to get out of here and go south." He looked at me and said, "You and my children are here. "I took some pictures. Keep them as a reminder. "But I won't step down. "I know they're going to kill me. I'm sure. "I see hatred in their faces. "Wherever I go, "I hear them whisper. "And I can see how deeply they hate me. "I know that I've had it. "I will fall, they'll kill me. "But I can tell you this. They'll do it in a cowardly way!" "Peasant Family Threatened" It was April 2nd, on a Monday. He was going to make a deal with the lawyer... about matters... concerning the land we lived on. Because we had a disagreement with the owner. The lawyer had called him that day, and he was going to pick up some books for our eldest son, who was starting secondary school. He brought my books, didn't he? Yes. You're a real teacher to me, Elizabeth Teixeira... you're a school for me. She is, above all, my life force, my reason for living. To be able to talk to Mr. Eduardo Coutinho. To argue with him over 100,000 cruzeiros, over 50,000 cruzeiros, 10,000 cruzeiros, 20,000 cruzeiros. I would even argue over 10 million cruzeiros if I had to...! Because besides having a saint for a father, I have a mother who is, what you can see here... Thank you, and sorry to interrupt. Go on! When he was murdered on Café do Vento Road, even the books he was carrying had bullet holes, and were covered in blood. He was smoking when he was shot. At around 8am they were selling "A Folha do Povo", and the newspaper had the whole story on him. And everybody bought it. It said, "President of the Paraíba Land Workers' League Shot." And his name was printed there as the name of a great man. And we all felt so sad. It happened, and it seemed like the dream was gone. Everything stopped moving. It felt very cold. As if the sun had gone out. The sadness of snatching a life and leaving only emptiness. That's how everyone felt. And why didn't you hear about João Pedro's death until the next day? The reason... I think the landowners tried to cover it up. And our comrades, after they found out about it, they were also... they didn't have the courage... to come and tell me what had happened. And how did you react? Were you desperate? Here's the thing. I... could hardly believe it. I went to the town where his body was. Abraão came with me. We walked. Then we got transport halfway. I went down to the morgue where his body was. His body was covered in bullet holes. It was barbaric! So sad. He still had dirt in his ears... And there was a pool of blood on the floor. And the murderers were never punished? They were never punished. João Pedro Teixeira was killed in an ambush on April 2nd, 1962, by two officers from the Military Police. Another participant was a cowhand from landowner Agnaldo Veloso Borges' farm, also took part in the ambush. "Agnaldo Makes Statement to Enquiry Committee" The judge in Sapé issued a pretrial detention order for Agnaldo, who was seen as one of the instigators of the crime. But he managed to avoid prosecution, by taking office in the Legislative Assembly. Agnaldo was the fifth vice-deputy. One deputy and four other substitutes stepped down on the same day, to allow him to take office. In March, 1965, the two police officers who shot João Pedro were unanimously acquitted by a jury. "Officers Accused of Shooting João Pedro Have Been Acquitted" We started to show the film in Galileia over an hour ago, everyone's watching closely. João Virgínio and his wife, Braz, Bia... Zé Daniel... João Mariano. João Mariano was the only actor who was not politically active. When we invited him to be in the film we told him who João Pedro was. João Mariano immediately agreed, mostly because, after having been evicted from a mill, he was still unemployed. But then he gradually started to relate to João Pedro's character. João Mariano is the head of a Baptist congregation, in Vitória de Santo Antão. I decided to interview him the following day. Without letting him know I was coming. Here's the thing... I don't take part... in certain movements. I got into this movement 16 years ago, through the mill. When the movement came along... Hold on a minute. There's too much wind. Cut. You can go on now. What you were saying was perfect. You can speak, Mariano. Don't be afraid. Just tell me how you live and that's it. OK, Mariano? Mariano...? I believe you know everything about it. I didn't want to be involved. I worked at the mill. Because of the League and so on. I got out because I didn't want to be part of it. It proves I didn't want to be part of it. When I got to town and you came to see me, so I took on the... let's say... career, without knowing what I was doing. Then, I realised it was all about property, land, and so on. Because I don't need land. The few things God has given me... I don't need that to live. I live without meddling with A or B. But when you came... because you were nice to me... I was interested in the work. But not about being part of that revolutionary business. And that's that. But tell me, what do you do for a living today? I do my own thing. I have no mill boss over me. And I want nothing to do with them. This is my life. And were you a Protestant at the time? Yes. That is why I was so disappointed at my church. They kicked me out. I was really heartbroken. For that reason, I don't want to go on with it. I believe you're recording everything I'm saying... But you can see from my face that I'm not, erm... erm... so dedicated to this movement. How long have you been a Protestant? It's been 28 years. - The Baptist church? - Yes, sir. Once bitten, twice shy. I was once disappointed. Why would I be again? What disappointed you? The church wouldn't support the movement. And I don't want revolution. I'm all about peace. Everyone living their own lives. That's how it is. - And you also have a little shop, right? - It's a waste of time! You weren't harmed by being in the film, were you? No, not harmed. Except by the mill owner. During the revolution, he was after me and tried to kill me. Because of a case in 1963? Because they compensated me at the mill. It was about that, not about the film. No one came after me because of the film. I wasn't disappointed. Only by the church. But did you enjoy seeing yourself in the film yesterday? I did, yes. Because we enjoy seeing the fruits of our labour, and I could see it in the film. I was very natural. It was all very natural, and not against A or B. I was pleased with what I saw. I saw the fruits of my labour. Twenty days after João Pedro was murdered, Elizabeth Teixeira travelled south. On May 5th, 1962, in Brasília, she spoke to the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry on agrarian affairs. I had to go to Rio de Janeiro to testify at the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry. When I arrived in Rio... I went on to Brasília... In Brasília the deputies and the President thought I should take João Pedro's place. Mostly to support my children and for the League to grow with my leadership. Because I was the leader's widow. I went on. And I said I would take his place even if I died. I would risk my own life and take his place. So I took over... I was dedicated... And in doing so, I fought and protested against João Pedro's murder. And the murders of all the other fallen comrades. I was also arrested... Not by one policeman, or two, or three! No! There were many and they shot at my feet. Shot at my feet... Even so, I didn't stop marching, but got into the car... and I let them take me. And when I got there, they started asking me a lot of stupid questions. Asking me about abroad... As if I knew anyone abroad! This was most likely the last time Elizabeth Teixeira was at a rally. The rally took place in early 1964, to celebrate the formation of the Agricultural Workers' Union in São Miguel do Taipu, a town near Sapé. Due to pressure from the Land Workers' Movement, the Federal Government started encouraging the creation of rural unionisation. Two weeks after this rally, a conflict near Sapé prevented us from filming "Man Marked for Death" in the area. One month later, in February, 1964, Elizabeth came to to Pernambuco, in order to take part in the filming in Galileia. "Sapé for God and Democracy" "Families March in Areia, Piancó and Uraína" "Guarabira Holds Family March for God and Freedom" "João Pessoa Marched Yesterday for God and Freedom" "March to Recife draws 200 Thousand People" These were the last scenes we shot for "Man Marked for Death" on March 31st, 1964, at night. João Pedro was gathering the labourers to discuss the formation of the Sapé League. Only three shots were filmed. The first one is when Elizabeth serves them coffee. The second one is when she hears a noise outside and goes to take a look. The last one is when she comes back frightened and says, "There's someone outside!" And then? March 31st, huh? March 31st... So, we were surrounded by the Army. Not from Pernambuco, but the Army from Paraíba. No one knew any of the soldiers that poured into the town. They walked in. Not by car. They walked all the way. They came pouring in! There were soldiers everywhere! Everybody started running into the woods. They were just looking for three people. João Virgínio, Zezé and Rosário. They wanted those three. And the film crew. But they couldn't catch us. Oh, yes, it was the film crew they wanted most! In which house did we shoot? It was over there. Right there. The house isn't there anymore, because it was too old. So, we tore it down and built it elsewhere. Zé Daniel's house was João Pedro's in the film. And it was also where we kept our film equipment. I went into the woods... I went all the way up to the field... and I shouted to Daniel's son, "Duda! Hey, Duda! Go tell everyone "the troops are coming! They'll be here in a minute!" Duda was playing football, but ran and delivered the message. You ran away, and I ran across the field. I saw they weren't coming. When I got there, you were running uphill. The film crew had already gone. They were hiding in the woods behind that hill. The troops arrived, and I could see from up there that they had three Army trucks. It was around 8pm. All I could hear was clattering coming from inside the house. The Army was ransacking the house. Turning it upside down. They turned the chairs upside down, the table, the bed. They took the mattresses out of the bedroom... They took the barrel, the big barrel that we used to store flour in, and threw it through the kitchen door. A pan of cassava we were cooking for dinner... and threw it outside and smashed it. They destroyed our bags and cases... my sister's suitcase... They took the generator, and the spotlights for the film. They took all the machinery, all the material sitting outside. "Subversive Material Seized, "guns belonging to the Armed Forces, "films for indoctrinating the workers, "lights for showing films at night, "(the training was intensive and long lasting) have been seized by the Army at the Galileia mill." This front-page picture from the "Diario de Pernambuco", shows film stock, tripods, lighting equipment and a megaphone. Normal film equipment. "It was in Galileia that the Army "seized material from the largest subversive communist group "in rural Pernambuco, abandoned by red leaders "along with the women and children. "In a typical peasant house, we have found extensive material "intended for spreading subversive ideas "by the international leftists who were in the area, "under the protection "of the recently deposed State government. "Inside the house was a powerful generator "which was used for powering "an expensive film projector. "Among many others found, the film taken "the week of the coup, "was 'Man Marked for Death'. "The film taught the labourers "to act in cold blood, "with no sense of guilt of remorse "when shooting was necessary "or decapitation or other forms of elimination "inflicted on 'reactionaries' captured in the field "or taken to Galileia, in the rural area of the State. "At the same time, a sociologist from Pernambuco, "who wishes to remain anonymous, "has started to draw up a plan "that shall be put into practice in Galileia, "in order to provide rapid, moral and social recovery "of the sub-race to which the communists have tried to reduce these peasants in Galileia." Zé Daniel took us to a hideout in the woods. At night, the troops went back to Vitória de Santo Antão. At night, we were together in the woods, and later the children arrived shouting, "Dad! Oh, Dad! Dad! Daddy!" I wanted -- I really wanted to go to them. "Don't go there, no." I wanted to go. "Come have some coffee! They're already gone!" Compadre Zé Feliciano said, "Compadre Daniel, come to the house. They're gone. Have some coffee!" I wanted to go! Why didn't you answer? I didn't answer because you were saying, "Don't go. No. Don't go." But I wanted to... We were worried the Army might still be there. They might have still been there. Early in the morning, we left the woods with Elizabeth and said goodbye to the people. We split into groups of three, climbed the hill and got onto the road to Recife a few miles ahead. Then each group took a different bus. And all of us managed to get to Recife. Only later, did we find out that five members of the crew who had chosen to stay in Vitória de Santo Antão, had been arrested. The Army went back to Galileia shortly after we left. On that day, April 13th, Zé Daniel surrendered. I gave myself up. At first, I said to him, "For the sake of the milk "you suck from your mother's breast, "for the love of Jesus Christ, Our Lord and Saviour... "if you see any reason to arrest me or beat me, or shoot me 2, 3 or 4 times, or for as long as I can take it." "So, you're afraid of going to prison?" "Yes, sir. I respect man, woman, and child. "So I can be respected too as a poor old man. I'm weak, thank God! And the Devil is poor!" I said, "I am a weak man, but live by my respect. "I want to die with honour! I hear you wanted to see me. "I want to die on my land. "But not beaten in jail! "If I am to be arrested or beaten, I will die running across the land, but I won't surrender!" Then Sergeant Saraiva says "Tell me where the guns are, Zé Daniel." I say, "Besides the gun you found in my house "and the little shotgun we use for hunting fowl to eat. These are all the guns we have in Galileia." "No, Daniel. The machine guns." "I've never seen one before! "I see one now in your hands. I wanted to see one, but I never have." With Zé Daniel's help, we hid the film camera in some sort of cave in the middle of the woods. The camera was the last thing the Army found. Under that rock there. Come down. Can you tell where it was? Under that rock there. What was under the rock? The camera they filmed with was under that rock. He asked me, and we came down the path. I didn't want to say it. So I said, "We'll see..." I didn't want to say I knew! But we came down the path. I said, "I think they came down here," but I didn't say that I had put it there. - Where was it? - Down the path. Then... then, I spotted the camera and I said, "Look! There it is!" They picked the camera up, and then they shouted, "Come! Come tell them I've found it! João José, Zé Daniel's son, was 20 years old at the time. The only things I managed to keep were two books left on the table. The Army took everything else. I keep my books inside this suitcase. "The History of a Manuscript - Kaputt" "Every morning I'd sit in the garden "under an acacia tree, "and start to work. "Whenever... an SS soldier... "arrived near... the hedge, the peasant would give a warning cough." So, when the troops came, the other would warn him. And the Army wouldn't get him. He'd escape. The story of your film is like that. "When I had to go to the front, "I entrusted the manuscript of Kaputt "to my friend Roman Suchena, "who hid it in a hole in the wall of the pigsty. "I... will always be grateful "to the peasant Roman Suchena "and his young daughter-in-law for helping me to save my dangerous manuscript from the hands of the Gestapo." So, this book reminds you of the film, right? Yes. It's yours! One of you left this book here. Whose book is this? I don't know. It was on the table. How many years have you had it? For 17 years. There's this one too. It's got, Fernando Duarte written in it. I think he was that skinny one. The cinematographer. So, I said, "It probably belongs to one of the film crew." It's about films and things... I kept them both. The Army captain wanted to take this one because there's a story about the World War in it and Russia or something. I said, "No sir, this book is mine." He said, "It's the Cuban's!" I said, "This book is mine." Who were the Cubans? You were. They thought we were Cubans? Yes! They thought you were Cubans making a film back then in 1964. Then I said, "No, sir, there's no Cubans or communists here." "Tell me where the guns and the Cubans are! I know those Cubans wanted to start a revolution here!" I said, "No, they never said anything about a revolution. They never said anything about Cuba." "But how did they speak? I said, "The same as everyone else" "But did they have an accent?" "Sure, but they spoke normal enough. Cariocas have a different accent, but they spoke normal." And the other one says, "They probably were Cariocas. They probably were, because Cariocas have an accent, don't they, Lieutenant?" I said, "Yeah, they sounded normal." "Did they talk to you? Did you understand what they said?" "Of course. Everything." Then, he said, "All right, then! Now you'll show me where the guns are!" I said, "There are only two farmers who have those. "One is a gentleman from Bento Velho mill... "and the other is Lourival Pedroso from the Gameleira mill. He has a lot of those! He's a cangaceiro! A big farmer." He said, "But those are his! Those guns are his! "Show me yours! Julião told me you had 20,000 guns "for you to start a revolution, do you hear? "And the communists were filming here for the revolution. Show me the guns!" Then he got rough. He started to get mad. I said, "Colonel, there are no Cubans or communists here. "There are people who are hungry, sick, suffering! "I'm sick myself! Do you hear me? "People round here need food and medicines, freedom and land to work on!" He said, "Hell, tomorrow I'll bring some medicine. "Tell everybody. Tell the people who are hiding in the woods, "to come see me, and I'll give them medicine and talk to them. Go get João Virgínio!" I said, "I don't know where João is." I turned myself in. I was hiding for seven days. I couldn't go anywhere. I had to turn myself in. After I had spent... eight days with the 4th Army... on April 15th... when Castelo Branco became President, they took me to the Department of Public Safety. They wanted me to make a statement. Before that, two police beat me up. Two other leaders from Galileia were arrested in the first two weeks of April. Zezé da Galileia was released after three months. Severino Gomes da Silva, also known as Rosário, old Zezé's foster son, spent 45 days in prison. I used to produce on this land where I'm standing. Half a truckload of produce every week! The Army took me and threw me in jail, I was blinded in one eye. I lost the hearing in one ear. After another beating my heart gave out. I spent six years in prison. What good was I to the nation behind bars? They took my watch, a belt, and my money. They took my jeep as well, They took my jeep. It's behind City Hall in Vitória, at the police station. They never gave it back to me. Call that a revolution? Put me in jail, my children left hungry? They took my jeep. They took my documents. They took everything. Why should the Army do this to me? It would be better if they'd shot me, instead of doing that. I'm angrier than I was before. They left my children to starve, and me in jail, beaten up and tortured. I spent 24 hours in a tank full of shit and piss up to the waist! There were turds this big! The stench...! It was a tiny space... and I was... I'd spend an hour like this, another hour like that, another hour like this, another hour like that. I was standing for 24 hours. Only the Devil could bear it! Spending 24 hours standing in a tank of shit. Only Satan... I can't believe I'm alive, because I never thought a man like me could take as many electric shocks as I did! But there's nothing better... there's nothing better than days with a night in between. Our Lord Jesus Christ will protect us. The grace of God is poured upon us, hour after hour. I trust in God, because of this misery... One day, people will have to realise who they are. We can't stay trampled down forever. Condemned to ten and a half years in prison, João Virgínio was released in 1970 after serving six years of his sentence. Recife's House of Detention was shut down and became a Cultural Centre in 1976. On April 3rd, 1964, one week before João Virgínio was arrested, Elizabeth Teixeira fled Galileia with the film crew and travelled to Recife. Unable to return to Sapé or stay in Recife, or she would be arrested, she decided to hide in Manuel Serafim's house, in Jaboatão. Our assistant director Vladimir Carvalho, took her there. Elizabeth changed her name to Marta, pretended to be Manuel Serafim's sister-in-law, and never left the house. Two months later, she turned herself in to the authorities in Paraíba. Did they treat you well? Yes. The Army treated me well. Did they ask you about Cuba? They did. And what did you say? I said I went to visit my son there. He had received a scholarship, from the Cuban government, and they had sent me an invitation... to visit my son. And this is why I was in Cuba. Did they accuse you of leading land occupations? They did. I wasn't leading any occupations. People occupied land because there were clashes between the owner and tenant. No owner wants the tenant to have any rights. He wants him bound and gagged. So the tenant has to take matters into their own hands. After four months in prison, Elizabeth was released, and went back to Sapé. Fearing for her safety, she went back to her father's house, where her children had already been taken. Then, the police started to persecute me. The police came to get me again. - This was at your father's house? - At Dad's house. Then, the police came back to take me. They wanted to take me back to their headquarters, where I could be tortured or even killed. So, I thought about it a lot, and I turned to my dad. I said, "Dad I can't go with so many policemen. "Since they're saying they're friends of yours, "make them go away and tell them I'll turn myself in tomorrow." I was sick. Dad spoke to Colonel Luís de Barros... and said I couldn't go. He guaranteed I'd go there the next day. So they took his word for it that I would go the next day. The next day I couldn't do it. I took the car and told Dad that I was going to see them, but I couldn't do it. I knew I'd be tortured, or even killed, like Alfredo and the boy. In September, 1964, shortly after Elizabeth's release, João Alfredo Dias, also known as Nêgo Fuba, and Pedro Inácio de Araújo, also known as Pedro Fazendeiro, founders of the Sapé League, vanished after leaving prison. They were never found. Three days later the newspaper said two mutilated corpses had been found by a roadside in Paraíba. According to the newspaper, they were two criminals who'd been killed by the Death Squad. The bodies were never identified. Did your father help you all this time? No. I don't even know if they're still alive. I don't know if they're still alive. Why didn't he help you? I really don't know. I don't know. It's better not to know. Didn't he help to bring up the children? He did. - He raised two of my brothers. - He raised two of them? We still don't know where they are. - But will you try to now? - Exactly. From now on we tell everything. Makes things easier. I want to try and find the rest of the family. You'll try? Why did you choose to keep Carlos especially? Well, you see... Dad didn't want to keep him, because he found him too much like João Pedro. He said he wouldn't have him. Is he like him? Yes, he is. In 1962, the persecution wasn't limited to João Pedro and Elizabeth. Three months after João Pedro's murder, Paulo Pedro, one of his children, was mysteriously attacked. What happened to Paulo? What was the attack about? The attack...? It was one of the thugs who worked for the estate owner. The same ones who killed João Pedro. - What did they do? - They shot him. - They shot him? - In the forehead. Out in the fields. - Was he badly hurt? - He was. I don't know if he's still alive. - You never saw him again? - No, never. - You don't know where he is? - No, I don't. I haven't heard any news. What about your daughter, Marluce? What happened to her? Marluce took poison and died. Was it because of her father's death? Yes. She said that after her father was killed, she hadn't had a single day of happiness. Not even for a day. The girl was always upset. She said she always felt that pain... and it got to that awful point. In December, 1962, eight months after João Pedro's death, Marluce Teixeira, the eldest daughter, committed suicide by arsenic poisoning. "Young Woman Commits Suicide with Strong Dose of Arsenic" "Marluce was the daughter of the late João Pedro Teixeira. She was 18 years old." When did you meet your first brother? I met him in 1978. In 1978, I went there and -- - Where? - To Patos, trying to look for him. - Abraão? - Abraão. - You don't know the other eight? - No, I don't know any of them. - How are you know here? - Marta Maria da Costa. Even legally. Marta Maria da Costa. Why did you choose "Marta"? Because it sounded like martyr... The name of someone who had suffered. And that suited me. But after this film, you'll go back into the world, won't you? I will. I'll go back out into the world again. The neighbours, everyone knows who I am... that I'm in Rio Grande do Norte... Now I'll get back in touch with my old friends... Find my children, my parents... Will you visit your parents? Yes! Mostly because my children are somewhere out there! I know my children are there, and I must find them, right? How could I not? In the first week of April, 1964, eight of Elizabeth's children were shared out among grandparents and aunts. Abraão stayed in the capital, where he was studying. Isaac went to Cuba in 1963 with a scholarship from the Cuban government. 15 days after my meeting with Elizabeth, I went to Sapé to try to retrace the past. A few miles from the town next to where João Pedro was murdered, a stone monument with an iron cross and a bronze plaque, built in his memory, was blown up in early April, 1964. The bronze plaque said, "Here lies João Pedro Teixeira, martyr for agrarian reform." In fact, João Pedro's body is buried in the Sapé cemetery, in an unmarked grave. João Pedro was born in a nearby town, Guarabira, and his father died when he was very young. Little is known about his youth. There are no pictures of João Pedro alive. The house where João Pedro lived his last days looks deserted. After the founding of the Sapé League, Elizabeth's father, Manuel Justino da Costa, a small landowner, had a quarrel with João Pedro and sold his farm to a businessman. Threatened with eviction, João Pedro fought a legal battle... for the right to live there, or receive compensation for the repairs and crops. After his death, Elizabeth was allowed to keep the farm, but stopped talking to her father. In 1981, 17 years after Elizabeth's escape, her children didn't know where she was hiding, let alone whether she was dead or alive. Not far from João Pedro's house we looked for his daughter, Maria das Neves Altina Teixeira, also known as Nevinha. We only knew she was married and she taught local children less than 600 yards from where João Pedro was murdered. How long is it since you saw your mother? Erm... a long time. 15... maybe 12 years. And do you miss her? Of course I do. She's my mum. What about your brothers, Abraão and Carlos? We haven't seen either of them. The others are nearer. Did you know your father, João Pedro? I did! I was six or seven years old when he died. - Do you remember him? - Not very well. - Is this your daughter? - Yes. What's her name? Juliana Elizabeth Teixeira do Nascimento. She has "Elizabeth" in her name. Yes. Juliana Elizabeth. - Why, Elizabeth? - It's my mother's name. And where can we meet Peta, your brother? Peta? At my grandfather's, by the flour house. Do you know where that is? If we go there, would your grandfather let us in? Well, my grandfather's a bit funny about that sort of thing. The other day... some people came by in a car. I don't know if they were cattle rustlers, you know? All I know is, that they came by every day, every week. He was quite... many people round here thought... He didn't... the family didn't think that... But people started saying, "It may be Elizabeth trying to kill you." A lot of people thought so. Then he got it into his head. He's old. He thought she was trying to kill him, steal from him. But they came... I think they were cattle rustlers. Manoel Justino and João Pedro Teixeira Jr, known as Peta, agreed to be filmed. But Elizabeth's father soon changed his mind and went into the house. Your grandfather raised you? Since I was a little boy. My mother went away. He brought the whole family here. Then an uncle came and took one of us, and another agreed to take another. Everybody in the family helped raise us. If it weren't for them, we would have died. Because 12 children in one house... starving... If it hadn't been for the family...? Everybody took someone, and three of us stayed at home. I'm still here, and the two girls went off to Rio. But we're alive, thanks to the family. If it weren't for them... But even so, I don't hate my mum. I want to see her, whenever she comes. I'll go wherever she might be. Do you have a picture of your father? I don't. Nor of my mother. I don't remember anything. I was four years old. Four years old... You were two years old when your father died. No. I was four years old. I was born in 1960. They killed him in 1964. No. He died in 1962. He died... I thought it was in 1964. I was little. I don't remember. I hear people talk. You rebuilt your father's memorial? I have. I made him a new cross. Because they destroyed it, right? I'm the only one here... I thought I'll do it for him, as his son. That's what I should do. Because they can't do it. I can make another one. I said I would make it because I wanted to remember him. I knew where he died. My family told me where it was. So I made a new one. And I lit a candle and all that. Why didn't Manoel want to have his picture taken? Because he's 84 years old. He doesn't think like young people like us. Eventually, we persuaded, Manoel Justino to come out and talk to us. You never got on with João Pedro, did you? No. I didn't ask him. But he came here. I gave him some advice, but he wouldn't listen... - And you never got on with him? - Never. But he was a good husband, wasn't he? Yes... In the end, he became my enemy. He said that if I ever went... if I ever set foot on his land there would be trouble. - Who said that? - He did! Her husband. - João Pedro? - Yes. He said I'd better not meddle. I'd better get back to work. Thank you! See you later! Throughout the conversation, Elizabeth's father never once said João Pedro's name. Still a working man at 84, Manoel Justino has a small flour mill, and goes out every day to buy wood and cassavas from nearby farms. João Pedro Teixeira Jr helps by driving his grandfather around. Not far from here, on Manoel Justino's land, João Pedro was murdered. Back in the League, Elizabeth marched down this road, leading peasant demonstrations to her husband's memorial. Caxias, Baixada Fluminense, in Rio de Janeiro State. October, 1981. Eight months after filming with Elizabeth. Please, is Marta in? I'm Marta. I'm a friend of your -- My mother's. - So, you've heard? - Kind of... This is her picture. Is there any light in here? This is her... This is your brother, Carlos. Do you remember him? I do. This is in Rio Grande do Norte. We went to see her there. Here she is washing her clothes in the river. This is her... She sends you a big hug. She's coming to see you. She's probably gone to look for your brothers. Take a look! Carlos as well... - Abraão, Carlos. - Uh-huh! And this is your mum. Yeah, I remember her well. This is when we were filming her. When did you come to Rio? I came to Rio in 1971. - 1971? - Yeah...! And you never went back? I was there... I think it was five years ago. And are you in touch with any of the people in Sapé? No! No, no... - Don't they write? - I'm the one who -- You won't say where you are? I cut myself off. Why? You see, the family... when you most need them -- They never helped you...? That's when they didn't help. Especially my brothers. I don't hold a grudge against them. I don't, but... when I needed them the most... they weren't there for me. Especially my mother's parents. - They didn't help you? - No. They have some money, don't they? Yeah, my family does, except my mother. But you don't hold a grudge against your mum, do you? No, I don't. Despite her having handed me over to my grandma... Despite all that, I don't hold a grudge against her. Why did she hand you over to your grandma? I don't know. I really don't. There's twelve of us, right? Twelve of us... twelve of us and I'm the only one she gave away. I wasn't even... Do you remember your father, João Pedro? I do... I do... He was... I adored him. Not just because he was killed. I adore my mother too. I bear no grudges, really. God forbid! Never! I love her! Whenever she comes, I'll be glad to see her. But after this film, you'll go back into the world, won't you? I will. I'll go back out into the world again. The neighbours, everyone knows who I am... that I'm in Rio Grande do Norte... Now I'll get back in touch with my old friends... Find my children, my parents... Will you visit your parents? Yes! Mostly because my children are somewhere out there! I know my children are there, and I must find them, right? - And the neighbours didn't know? - They knew nothing! Dad thinks I'm either dead or abroad! - You came here to work? - I did. - Where did you work? - I worked in... I forget the street, but it's here in Caxias. I was already pregnant with my eldest son. My firstborn's now 10. - You came here with him? - I was pregnant. - He was born here? - He was... I was well off at the beginning. It was good. I had a car, jewellery, everything... Then, the man I was living with... Actually you met him. Manuel Alves... at Rua Felizardo Forte, number 66. I lived with him... for around 10 years. I have three children by him. Then, he did some awful things, and we couldn't go on. So, we separated and I moved here. I had nothing. Nothing! But it doesn't matter. - And the children? - I have four children. Santa Clara School of Medicine, provincial capital of Las Villas in Cuba. December, 1981. Isaac Teixeira is in his fifth year of medical studies. Film shot at our request by a Cuban film crew. What I remember about Brazil and my dad's struggle... is that it was almost two decades ago. Back then... he started to organise the peasant leagues in Brazil. And my father... was committed... to his work in the Northeast of Brazil where he founded... and worked for the Sapé League. I think he was a pioneer of the peasant leagues. And it had great repercussions, right? After his struggle and his death... Everyone... admired him... for being a peasant, a humble man, dedicating his whole life... to the struggle of the Brazilian people. Take two! Please, José Eudes. - What? - José Eudes. - Eudes? - Do you know him? - I do, yes! - Can you go get him? Sure! Please come with me. - He's the watchman here, right? - What?! - Is he a watchman? - Yeah! What channel are you? TVE or Globo? No, it's a film. It's a report, but for a film. By Avenida Brasil, Rio de Janeiro. We're entering the warehouse of an engineering company. May, 1982, one year and three months after filming with Elizabeth. - Who's Mr. Coutinho? - I am, I am! You may come in, but I only want to talk to you. Nice to meet you, José Eudes. He's coming in by himself. Excuse me. I want to talk to him in private. Excuse me, sir. Please take this. After a long talk and a few demands, José Eudes Teixeira agreed to let us film him. But it should be outside. Do you remember your mother and father? No. No. Who raised you? An uncle, who I call Dad. His name is Eudes. He's my uncle, but I call him Dad. You were four years old when your father died, right? - Exactly! - And you don't remember it? I don't! I honestly can't remember him at all. But you remember your mother! You were six in 1964, right? No. I can't remember her either. I only know her from these photos you showed me. I didn't recognise her. I didn't have a picture of her. - Would you like to see her? - I would! Very much! I even cried when I got her first letter. I couldn't remember her. I called the aunt who raised me, Mum. And I actually, I still see her as my mum. When they killed my father and my mother had to disappear, or else they'd kill her too, we weren't even baptised. So my godparents raised me and had me baptised. I don't know four of my brothers. Paulo, Abraão... Isaac and... Carlos. I don't know Carlos either. - You don't know Paulo? - No. Why not? Paulo -- When I was there, he went to Nazaré da Mata with my uncle. So, I never knew him either. What does he do now? He works as a driver for some company... And he's married... Actually, my brother has seen him. He said he's very angry about the whole family situation. He said he drinks a lot. He's very angry... me too... I used to live with a woman... She said, "You're different from other people." Because I am... Sometimes I don't talk to anyone, I feel angry... when I think about my family's history, you know? Olaria, Rio de Janeiro. Film shot on the same day as the interview with José Eudes. May, 1982. Excuse me, does Marinês live here? Yeah. I don't know if she's in. You don't? Could you have a look for me, please? What a pity... The window's closed. - There's so many people! - Come! It's no big deal! - How are you? - This is my son. - I'm fine! - How cute! What's his name? It's Rodrigo... and Elana. - Are they both yours? - Yeah, my two children. How long have you been living in Rio? It's been seven years. - Seven years? - Uh-huh! Why did you come? Why did you move? - Marta sent for me. - She did? Right! I was living with an uncle. She sent for me. - Do you remember your mum? - No, I've never seen her. I've only seen her in a photo Marta sent me. - Don't you remember your father? - No, I never saw him. - You were eight months old...? - Three months! Do you want to see her? I do! I do... - Or do you feel hurt? - Hurt? No. Not at all. Did she write to you? Yes, she has written twice. - What do they say? - This is the first one. Would you read a little bit? "You say you don't know where you come from. "You come from our flesh, "from the love between your father and me. Of course, I'm so glad you're coming." I asked her if I could see her. "That's what I want, to meet... "meet all my children and be with you all. "Thanks to the political situation opening up, "I'll be able to see all my children again. "I wasn't able to live with you, raise you, and love you, "but since fate got in the way, it must be God's will. "But I would be overjoyed... "if I could spend at least one day together with all my children, so that we can put this separation behind us." The filming we did in São Rafael, in February, 1981, ended many years of hiding for Elizabeth Teixeira. After she was filmed, she was no longer Marta, but became Elizabeth again. You take in washing, Elizabeth? Yes. And what else do you do to make a living? I wash dishes at a bar... I also teach the children. - 4 x 1? - 4! - 4 x 2? - 8! - 4 x 3? - 12! - 4 x 4? - 16! - 4 x 5? - 20! - 4 x 6? - 24! - 4 x 7? - 28! - 4 x 8? - 32! My neighbours knew nothing. And how did they react when they learned who you were? They looked for pictures of me... tried to find out who I was, where I came from. I told them I used to live in Recife, where I worked as a maid, but it didn't work out. That I moved with my son... and that I ended up here. That's what I told them. Are they glad to know you're Elizabeth? They are! Did you enjoy the film about Elizabeth? It's very important because... Marta... I mean, Elizabeth, had such a tragic past. Many things were really very sad. Now you know, has she changed? She's the same old Elizabeth... She's the same friend! Who else wants to speak? When she arrived in São Rafael, I was her first neighbour. We've always been great friends. My Zorro was her first pupil. She's a great person. She's like a mother to me. And did you think she only had one child? - What did you know about her? - Nothing, when she arrived. Where did you think she came from? - From Jucurutu. - She'd come from Jucurutu. - And she only had one child? - Yes, I did. Are they all your friends? Yes. All good friends. She was my neighbour. We shared a backyard. We felt for her and her suffering. and we could tell she was very sad on the inside, but she never said a thing. All she said was that her husband had been murdered, and that she had other children, but she couldn't see them. We knew she was deeply heartbroken. We wish her every happiness, because she's such a great person. We will miss her a lot. "São Rafael Rural Workers' Union" He's the President of the Union. We talked a lot... about the Union, about how it's going... now, today. We also talked about... the people in Vale do Açu. How they'll be compensated... when they have to move from Vale do Açu... As President of the Union, he knows the situation a whole lot better. São Rafael is a dying town. The National Department Against Drought, is developing a new irrigation project, which requires building a massive dam. The water will flood the entire municipality. Since they don't have property deeds for their land, the small landowners of São Rafael are not being fairly compensated, according to them. The local union is leading the fight, pushing for better compensations. And is Elizabeth helping you? She advises me because she tells me what she's suffered... And I tell her what I've been going through. We talk about it a lot. Did you already know she was Elizabeth, instead of Marta? Yes, I knew. - How long have you known? - Maybe a year. Since we got to know each other better. - Did you know who João Pedro Teixeira was? - Certainly. - Who was he? - He was a great leader! - Where from? - From Paraíba. From Sapé. When she told me what she'd been through, and since I could relate to that, I understood that her suffering is the suffering of all union leaders like ourselves who are persecuted by the landowners... and authorities in Brazil. Elizabeth, let's go outside and say goodbye. We have to pack our things and our equipment. Shall we? I thought I would never see you again... and the other comrades. But now... I see my house... old comrades come to see me. So, for me, it's a big deal. A big deal. I never gave in, I never gave up the fight... What I did was the only way. But now we are very thankful to our President... for having given us the honour to be able to talk to people, give speeches, get in touch with our children, our parents... and all our relatives. You really caught me close to tears. You know... I was really moved. It was 16 years... Abraão hadn't been here. He never had the chance. The fact that he could come... And you came. I was very moved. I never expected it. He called me and said he was coming. The girl picked up the phone, and said he was coming with Carlos and another brother. Then, when he got here I said, "Is Carlos here?" "No, Mum. Coutinho is coming to make a film." I said, "Oh, my! What's going on?" I was... really moved. - Was the report good? - It was! It was great! It would've been better if I could have helped you. When you got here, I was very emotional. See you soon, Elizabeth. Are you really going? - Yes, we must be going. - I hope everything was OK. The fight goes on! We have the same demands as we did in 1964! They haven't moved an inch. The same demands... for the workers, for the peasants, and for students. The fight goes on. As long as there's hunger and poor wages, we have to fight! How can we not fight for better days? You must fight! Whoever has a good life, let them stay out of it! I have suffered. I have to fight! The regime must be changed. We all must fight while this "so-called democracy", this hunger exists. Democracy without freedom... Democracy without hunger and misery? While workmen's sons have no right to study. Like now, when I... when the kids pay I don't know what. This won't do! A month later Elizabeth Teixeira left São Rafael and moved to Patos, Paraíba, with her sons Abraão and Carlos. Up until June, 1983, when this text was written, Elizabeth had only managed to see two of her other eight children: Nevinha and Peta, both in Sapé. We last filmed João Virgínio at his home, on Carnival Sunday, in 1981. Ten months later, João Virgínio died of a heart attack in the same place. He was buried in the cemetery at Vitória de Santo Antão, next to Zezé da Galileia.
