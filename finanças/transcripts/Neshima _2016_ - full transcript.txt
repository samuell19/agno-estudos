Subtitles by explosiveskull Before the river of time began, we rejoiced in Neshima with our creator, our Ba'al. He created the world as a gift, to delight his love Sita. However, she became enamored with mortal life and longed to experience it herself. Ba'al granted her desire on the condition that she lead an army of righteous warriors to protect those who could not protect themselves. Ba'al missed his love and came to live among us. He wore the key to Neshima as a crystal and crown upon his head. In time, Sita gave birth to twin boys, Dava Hataka and Sunita. One of whom would eventually lead our people. Dava Hataka was intelligent and calculated. Sunita was carefree and lighthearted. When they came of age, Sita chose Sunita as her successor. Dava Hataka was furious and conspired to usurp the throne. On the day of the coronation, Dava Hataka came to celebrate Sunita. You may return when you have found this. The broken crystal disappeared from Dava Hataka's sight Ba'al hurled one shard into the deserts of Pudesh and banished the attackers to search in vain. Ba'al charged us to keep the remaining piece and Dava Hataka's dagger safe in the forest until Sita's return. By the flight of the dagger, you will know. Then he faded away. For countless migrations we have waited. Endless raids and famine have driven us further into the forest, further to obscurity. Our numbers grow ever smaller. Most believe we must keep waiting. However if Sita does not return soon, we will not survive. Some believe it is still our duty to protect others. And that she will not return until we once again renew our purpose. We cannot simply forget, for our king dreams nightly of the prophecy, that one day Sita will be reborn. One day she will reunite the key to Neshima and bring us home. Soon our long wait will be over. For this is the story of Sita's return. Uma! It's practice, it's unnecessary. Maybe for you, but even you have things to learn. Perhaps you can teach me. Ease. No, he should understand that not everyone can do stupid and crazy things to bide them, they need to learn and practice. And why should I slow down to benefit the weak? - Coward. - Bhimala! He is to be king and you should show him that respect! You're right. I burden. Lift it, lift it. The burden is mine. Let's spar, you have the spirit. Notice my benevolence, my subjects will adore me. Well too bad for you, the whole tribe isn't made up of empty headed females. Did we not just declare peace? Empty headed females, that's no way to talk about your own sister. Would you please hold this, my princess? What is this? It's a needle. You're doing well, too slow for me! I don't need to be fast with you, I'm more intelligent. And I'm stronger than you both! I will settle for determine! No fair, teams! Get off! A very good training session. That's not fair taking us to the ground like that. Nobody can lift an ox like you can. We sparred out here, so there are no rules, yes? Don't use your mountain man logic on us, okay? I'll never understand your humor. And I'll never understand your need to fly against the moon. Well well well, Lakshmi it is again that time where we tell everyone how good I was and how good they were not. And so Trailanga, I can certainly tell they're not at the same level that you are. A known fact. When it comes to scoring the lowest in a sparring match. All lies. I'm sorry, but at 36 blows you came in last. Bhimala had 51. Kshat 60 and Achala 55. You were sitting the whole time, so how can you be certain you saw every strike? That count sounded about right to me. - My counts are right. - Probably add one or two. 15. I guess I'm dangerous without my collar. What is happening, Bhimala is becoming a man. I mean what's next, Achala, you gonna break into song? What a strange little man. You are even stranger, gigantic man. You're both right, now fly. My sister and I have work to prepare for the afternoon. Fine. You have not heard the end of this. You may be king by the end of this night, but I will have my rematch. - And I will beat you again. - My peace, princess. Rain or steel, Gorren drown. It's always here. Did you check under the flowers, by the back? Sure. Your turn. I don't fight. You're a princess. Bond of blood runs through your veins. You're a fighter at heart. What are you gonna do in when the Gorrens sneak into your yurt at night? They're extinct. Come on, Lak, just one round. It'll be fun. I'll use one arm. Which one? The bad one. Avoid my strengths, attack my weaknesses. Do not let the slap of emotion run over your heart. It's easy to say when you're facing your little sister! Enough. What's the point? Clearly I'm not destined to even take on a small warrior like yourself. Apparently there's a reason for my passiveness other than righteousness. You know what you need. What? What? You need to relax. It's almost time for the coronation. I don't need much coming from the hunters. But you have to see that have to focus on peace rather than war. Little sister it's not about war or peace, but you're right about one thing. It's seems as though you're not yet ready to take on even a small warrior like myself. Be on time so mama doesn't worry. You had me worried half to death. We haven't much time. For you. Thank you. Now we don't have much time. Relax, it's not as if they'll start without me. My boy, have a seat. In here lies the very soul of our people. For hundreds of migrations, we have kept our secrets safe from the outside world. I now pass that burden onto you. Is this? It is. You must keep this in a safe place. Guard it with your life. No, guard it with your heart. When the time is right, Ba'al will send you on a quest to seek out its counterparts in desert of Pudesh. Not before it is Ba'al's will, do you hear me? How will I know when it's time? When you accept the royal dagger on receiving line, you will also be accepting the king's dream. The prophecy shall be shown to you as you sleep. That is not all. Lakshmi must accompany you on this journey. No! Father, the desserts of Pudesh are no place for a huntress. I will take my best warriors, leave it to me. This is why you must go, Lakshmi. Because you bear the the mark that I have seen in my dreams every night since I became king of the Bonda. And it always flies toward the dessert. As if it were an eagle flying to its nest. Father, please don't. You knew this was to happen? This is not of my choice. This is the way of our people. Father, please. When the time is right, Kshat will call upon you and you will go. It is time. Since the time of the cursed brother, the holder of this dagger has guided our tribe. Those of the blood may receive it. Our tribe's safety becomes their burden. Until Sita, our warrior and protector may return to her people. May be guided by Ba'al's will. Kshat, please rise. Will you assume the burden of guiding us in Ba'al's will? To protect our people, to guard our sanctity, to lead and protect us as we continue to prepare for Sita's return? I eagerly accept my duty. As protector of these people, I've trained you since birth to take my place to better our lives. And I'll pass that burden onto you. You have my blessing in all the things that you do. I'm honored that you would receive me as your new king. For generations we have maintained peace under the great King Buddhi. We will continue along our path and we will be ready for Sita to return to us and to lead us to Neshima. The ceremony is over, let the festivities commence. The elders of the council would like to honor our new king. May you know that you always have the trust of the council. To the king. Perhaps it is time to prove our readiness. I'll be leading the tribe. My father will resume his role until I return. And I'll be taking some of my warriors with me. You would take the security of the village? I possess a shard of the crystal from Sita's cave. You have kept the key to Sita's return in private? This is my declaration. I will gather my warriors and we will go out to the desserts of Pudesh and reunite the crystal with its counterparts. This will surely convince Sita that we are ready for Sita to return to us and lead us to our true home! Our home in Neshima. It's his right. We cannot contest his declaration. Leave the crystal to me. So when do we leave? Next moon. I've always wondered what lies beyond the forest. Why can't we go tonight? I'm not sure Bhimala can last that long without Master Vyasa. Well, someone's gonna have to protect her from all the wild bunny rabbits out there. Yeah, okay, number one, some bar bunnies are in fact dangerous. Number two, I took it easy on you earlier today because I didn't wanna damage the fair prince on his day of coronation. And I know the real reason why we're not leaving for the next moon and it's spelled Uma. Now that I'm king, I can still put you on hunting... Have mercy. I yield. He's king for less than one sunset and he's drunk with power. And I do believe it was you, that Master Vyasa set on perimeter this evening. Now if the bunny rabbits has cotton tails like that I'll be just fine. Excuse me. Lakshmi. - I can't. - What's the matter? I can't. Lakshmi. Is Lakshmi coming with us? She is. She just needs a little more convincing. She can't. No further discussion at this point. I'm going with you. There's no discussion on that point. Remember, I was raised near the desert border, my experience would come in handy, my king. You work under my father, if he gives you his blessing, you can follow me on this quest. But you may not follow me while I relieve myself. Uma. Oh. Kshat, you scared me. Holding up? It looks worse than it is. And so I'm king now. I know. It's wild, how does it feel? It's going to be harder than I thought. I've decided to go on a quest. A quest! So soon? It's sounds scary. Daring and dangerous. What happened? We didn't see the babies in time, I was already poised to attack. You're lucky my sister Lakshmi was there. I will leave you to heal. Are you so frightened by a huntress, great warrior? You need to rest. Do I? Stay. I've never seen such a look on your face. What is it? What if the fulfillment of the prophecy is not what it seems? My handsome Buddhi. Do not fret, enjoy the night. Migrations have come and gone since the last time your tribe was so lighthearted. Lighthearted they may be, but emotions cloud their mind. You speak of excitement. Happiness only comes now and now, and now. Do not let us avoid the moment. Gorren! Go. Kshat, Kshat, look at me! We have to go. Take her. Master Vyasa take her! The village is gone. - No! - Come with her to the caves! Kshat! No, we're too late. They're our people! No, Kshat, run! We are in terrible condition. Where are the king and queen? Buddhi and Raddha have not yet come. Where are the others? We had to leave quickly, there was nothing we could do. We need you here, to protect what's left of the tribe. This is no time for new kings. Where is the crystal? The crystal you swore to protect. They took it. You gave them the crystal, and I will get it back. Don't leave! We all must act in safe unison. He abhor you! To understand our position. Honor your sacred oath to the Lord Ba'al to protect this tribe with your life, this council orders you to remain here and guard this cave. How dare you draw steel to me. There's no need. No there's not! Let us go. I am the backbone of this tribe! I live and die for its survival, you? We have seen what has happened under your protection. You should not speak of duty! Then do your duty, and protect what is left. Do yu say this is a time for no kings? We do. Follow the path of righteousness, Kshat. Kshat. Kshat, Kshat, we need to find Om and Baba before it's too late. We need to find them and pray to Ba'al for guidance. Silence! Kshat, we need to find them. I can't do it on my own and whoever did this might still be around. - Kshat, please! - Fine, fine. Fine. Fine. We take the north ridge, take this. I don't fight. Lakshmi. Trailanga. Kshat, if we go around the ridge we can head them off. No. Kshat, if we have any chance of catching them. I haven't done this since I was a small child. Remember spending hours floating these with Master Vyasa. This is harder than it looks. It's all about the wind. Use the arms to create an updraft, like this. Move down the perimeter. Mama, baba! Mama, mama! Lakshmi, Lakshmi. No. No. - Lakshmi - No. Lakshmi! Do not deny them this! Do not deny them this. Lakshmi, let's go hunting. We should move out. Erbai put me in charge, Oak. Keep your place. Keep hiding behind your king, Akrim. One day he won't be around to watch your back. Gorren, move out! Why do you hate him, my father? Erbai is a fool. You're on your own when you say such things. Well then that makes me truth's only companion. Are you alright? Should I be alright? What happened back there? There's a lot about being a warrior you still need to learn. Our journey's just begun. What if there isn't much time? You aren't alone. I will never let you fall. And your brother, he will never let you fail. I buried my heart in the dirt. Vish, will you go with us? Yeah. Will you? Yes. Here! At least 40 or 50 strong. Some are Gorren, their footsteps dig deeper. We should follow these tracks. They lead toward the dessert. Let's fly. Lak. Lakshmi. You're all trained warriors, you're more likely to succeed without me. Don't worry little sister, you can wait in the cover of forest with Trailanga and Vish. I will get you the crystal and come back to you. And when they come back they will have Gorren skull. That's not funny. It wasn't meant to be. Set up camp down the way, we'll be back before nighttime. Don't go looking for trouble. Don't let anything keep you from coming back. This is mine. Hold onto it for me. You need help? Warriors begin their training with basic hunting skills and that does include building sleeping quarters when we're far from home. Come on. I will make the yurt while you tell me more about the art of war. Yes, well, war is not an art in itself really. Such as hunting or other skills we do out of necessity. It's righteousness that makes the art into a graceful expression of Ba'al's will. If you die in an act of righteous battle you are directly sent to Neshima. Everybody knows that but how do you know that you're on the right side? It's not what side you're on that counts. What does that mean? It means righteous lies in how you do it not what you do. Why don't you finish with the yurt, Vish and I will show you eagle's form. Then you'll get it. Or why don't you continue building the yurt as was your duty while I take Lakshmi to go gather some food? I see what's happening here. And when you get back you're gonna see the greatest yurt that was ever built. I've never seen this part of the forest, it's beautiful. Lakshmi. I don't know what the prophecy will bring. I've seen many stars in many lands and I know my heart. You have many burdens to bear. I do not pretend to hide my pain from this. You are forever a shunt to my soul. Let us come together as one. To unite our souls for what lies ahead. May I give my heart over to you? - Kshat! - Bhimala. 20 to 30, we were wrong in our initial count. And so? Those tracks back there were too muddy for us to clearly see. This count should be more accurate. Kshat we should go back. We should go back? See them in the morning. You wanna go back? Then go. You, go! Thought we should regroup. Regroup with whom? We're the only ones out here! Why are you here? Why? Because there's nothing back there. This way. Turn your shoulders, little more forward. Step. Slow down, like that. Down like this? That's it. Keep your head in protection of your arm. Gorren curl. You don't have to block. - Do it again. - Okay. Kshat? This is it. The crystal. Kshat. You know what to do. This will save everything, right? Yes. This will make it all better. Will it? You believe that, do you? This will fix everything? The prophecy will not bring your family back! That's all we have left. Gorren curl. Where's my crystal? They must have followed our tracks. How do you know? That flash can only have come from the crystal. Scout, lead us back. Why does it glow? You lied to me. This thing has fallen from Neshima. The Gorren hesitate because their heads are full of muck. They probably threw the shard in the bag. We made the crystal whole again, Sita will be on her way. Lakshmi, we have returned. Look what we have found. I think you mean what I've found. Nice job, Kshat. You circle around for a day, you find your way back to camp. - Brilliant. - Did you get it back? I just followed your legendary aroma. It's not funny. Kshat, did you get it back? Now that is a story with an audience. Scout, which way? Tracks are hard to find in the dark. It will take time. Then we wait. Then emerged the crystals together all before the Gorren dogs even woke up. Once again, you risked your neck and got away with it. Wait a second, does it seem a little too easy to anyone else? I mean there it was the whole time, just beyond the gors of our fallen home? You talk too much. Father told me what to do with it when I found it. Bhimala! Bhimala! Bhimala! Achala! Kshat! No! I will enjoy you, pretty one. He will never enjoy anything again. I've been waiting a long time for you. I like that fire in you, it saddens me that we have to quench it. If you want me dead, kill me already. But at this point I need you. Will I always? Maybe not. You're a thief and a murderer. And you ignore the truth. Tell me how it works. I'd rather die than help you. I said I liked your fire, but do not mistake me, I have very little patience. I will not be held back! Everyone has a choice. It was the choice of your elder to hand it to me. Cowardice rules your people. Your choice. You have to help me or die. You may be Sita reborn but you have become mortal. You can die like the rest of us. I'm not Sita reborn and you're nothing but a barbarian. The markings on your wrist, what does it mean? Sita will come for you and she will take revenge for my family's death! What does it mean? Tell me girl! You don't know, do you? It means. It means. You don't know, do you? You don't know your own prophecy, the one you so boldly protect. I know your people stole our crystal. And your people, they killed Sita! Wrong! The Bonda stole the crystal! And forced our people out of the forest to live like nomads. No, that's not true. My people would never... Your people would never what? Lie? Cheat? Your people would do anything to protect your people. Now tell me how to use that crystal before I put my ax in your neck and send you to your precious family. I need to know the secret to the crystal. Find out how it works! I didn't make myself clear? We need to return this to our king. Erbai's not half the king you think he is. You're calling my father a coward? He's led us everywhere he thought they were to be! You cannot replace him! This has nothing to do with leading the Gorren. This is the eyeball, the key to Neshima. It will be found when Sita has been reborn. There it is in your grasp and there she is in mine! She's just a scared little girl! I've been looking for that scared little girl since before I learned to kill. My father has never mentioned any of this. You have no intention of returning. Erbai is content leading his army of ignorant peons. I have what I've been looking for. I'm going home to Neshima. You coming home, nephew? Or are you running to daddy? You can do what you claim. I'll stay out of your way. And if I can't? Then you have more than me to worry about. The only thing that worries me, Kael, is continuing this existence. It is not out there that we fear. It is what's inside that makes us restless. A restless soul is full of duty to find peace. It is this duty that I fear. How does it feel, lying in the cold desert sand while the sun sucks away the last drops of water from your body? I wake up to this every morning. I was born out here and as long as I've lived I've hated it! My entire family is dead. The sooner you kill me, the sooner I will be with them! I don't want to kill you, but he does, don't you see? You'll die. You'll die slowly, only death on the sand. I see them die every time I sleep. Over and over again. This emptiness of my life. You seek to make a reward out of it. What about your people, if what you say is true, you're all they have left. Little sister, it's not about war or peace. Tell me how it works, I will free you. You have my bond at the right time. You can go back to your people. Put it to your forehead. What? Connect the crystal to your forehead and it will show you the way to Sita's guardian. That's it? It's useless without her. Without Sita, the guardian will suck the life out of you. Even before the sun has the chance to take my last drops. Oak! Oak! It's a map. It's a map. I can see a path leading north. Neshima. Well it will appear we have no more use for you. Time to meet your friends. Wait, you can't kill her! What do you mean? She is Sita. Yes, if I'm Sita, without me you'll face the guardian and balance with my protection. You will command your guardian to let us pass. It seems we may need you a little while longer after all. Let's move out! Keal. Kill it. Run away, run home! Little sister. Do not run away. It is not about war or peace. You will die now! You are finally here. I. It has been so long. We are finally home. What burdens you? The survivors. There is no hope for them now that we have returned. Send me back to show them the way. You will not be able to come back until you lead them all home. Oh send me back. I love you and what can be will be done. Erbai! Erbai! Erbai! Erbai. What do you want? We found the Bonda. We found the eye of Ba'al. This is not a matter to discuss in an open forum. Remember who you are talking to. We found the crystal. Will you disrespect me? I see no crystal. You've had too much to drink in the desert sun. Erbai. We have followed you faithfully. And you have brought us many feasts and women. Either lead us to the crystal or we will follow Kael there. Wait! You should come with me. It is your duty to lead your people. But how will I convince them? By the flight of the dagger you will be known. Pass the test. Lakshmi! We thought you had been taken by the Gorren. Where are the others? We must be getting close, the sky is so beautiful. Neshima, I know the way and we have to leave immediately. You, you know the way to Neshima? I am Sita reborn! Follow me and I will lead us to Neshima. I will be tested. The test is fatal if you do not pass. She is right. She must be tested. We're finally here. Is it not beautiful? Mad! You drag us out to the middle of the forest with claims to have found Neshima? We have been fooled. Yes, I must show it to you as well. You're a lunatic! And an imposter. Your eyes are filled with dirt. I know you! There is no room in Neshima for unrighteousness. I've led us to Neshima, did you see that? We see a dog not worthy to be called a man. We thought Sita's return would bring us peace. You led us right to the Gorren? But it is not about war or peace. It is about righteousness. It is about doing what must be done. And so today, we fight! Subtitles by explosiveskull
