Where are you going? At this hour? I asked you something. Answer me. Where are you going? Don't touch me! Your father will straighten you out. So much arrogance! Stop. Go back to your room. Look, your daughter is running away again. Your scolding is of no use. Gauri! Papa, I'd rather die than come back to this house. Hey! Gauri! Come back! Why don't you stop her? A young woman alone at night… What if she gets the wrong idea? Stop her! Call her. She'll be back. How far can she go? Turn on the fan. Get me some water. Listen, talk to Mommy. She wants to talk about Rumi. Okay, I'll call her. But I am not going to do what she's asking me to do. No harm in hearing her out. We'll do what Rumi likes. Okay. Bye. Come in. Doctor. Okay, Zora, you're doing really well. So, I will see you in six weeks' time. - Sure. - Look after yourself. - Okay. - Are you happy? I'd feel better if my husband was here. - Bring him for the scan next time. - All right. All right? It'll be fun. - Okay. See you in six weeks. - Okay. Doctor, we have no other appointments till 2:00 p.m. You want to take a break? Head for lunch, maybe? No. It's okay, I'm fine. Okay. Everything all right? Can I get you anything? Yeah, I'm fine. Oh, and tomorrow, your appointments in the morning are from the Jurong shelter home. All right. All abortion cases? Yes, about six of them. Okay. Can I get you some tea? No, it's okay. You carry on for your lunch. Okay. I can get you ginger and mint. Your favorite. - Okay, thanks. - Okay. This is you. No, that is you. It's the men's section. Gauri, they've got more clothes here. This is not bad, right? I like it. - Oh, Gauri you're too short for that lah. - Yeah. - It's good. - Probably have to wear heels with that. - Yeah… - This one's nice. Look at this. Yeah. - Oh, that is very nice. - Yeah. Try it. But it's very expensive. I don't think I can try it. Just wear. Just try. You don't have to buy it. If you have it, flaunt it. You have two of the same one. This shop is damn expensive. These two are exactly the same one. Give me any. Look at me. Okay. Purse your lips. Look in the mirror. Ta-da! - I see the difference. - Totally. I love this, though. I really want this. Actually, one is size M and the other is size S. Which one would you like to keep? Just… any. Are you sure? Just give me both. Sure? Okay. I'll wrap them up for you. Put them in a bag. They are very nice. So, you live around the area? I've never seen you around here. Yeah. Yeah. You're very lucky. It's a very beautiful area. It has lovely coffee shops and lots of shops around. Okay. Shut up. Peeku! What's going on? - I'm reading a book. - Which one? - Lost and Found - What took you so long? I've been calling you. You need to take all the stuff to the shop. Go back to your book. - I won't. I have to finish my schoolwork. - What? I know the schoolwork you do all day. Baking cakes and biscuits won't make you a doctor or an engineer. Hurry. Take that stuff to the shop. Your father called twice. Remove those. What's wrong with you? I'm speaking to you. Where did you get that lipstick? My friend gave it to me. I know where you loaf around all day with your "friend." - Where did you get this? - It's mine. I bought it. You "bought" it? Where did you get the money? Whose money? I'm asking you something. Don't you dare hang up on me next time. - Yes, ma'am. - How much is it? - Four dollars. - Four dollars? Okay. Ah, exactly. Here. - Thank you. - Thank you. - See you. - See you. - Any Kadhi (Indian curry)? - Yes. Give me a Kadhi and rice. Having here, or pack it? - Takeaway. - Oh, yeah. Mr. Raj, 50 dollars short. Thank you, Mr. Raj. Papa, I'm going out with a friend tonight. Don't be late. Your mother worries. All right. She is not your enemy. Leaving a message to the family group won't hurt your pride. Will do. I'd better be going. Wait. Don't spend it. Save it for emergencies. Lavender? It's good, what? It's not what's on the inside. It's what's on the outside. Yeah, but it should be both, right? Like, one should experiment, you know? Says who? Your chef, Raymond Kwan? Exactly! That's, like, rich people's bullshit. Don't buy that. It's not for us. We gotta show off some more. Helping your dad? Or helping the guy that works there? There's nothing. He just works in the kitchen. - Really? If you say so. - There is a guy? - Yeah. - No. You two snogging or not? - Sure, look at her. - Just shut up, okay? - She's been grinning all day. - There is nothing. Just shut up. Hey, what's the time? Okay, let's get going. - Go back to the class. - You all go first, can? - I will come. - See you. Yeah, come in. Doctor. Gauri, please come in. - Have a seat. - Sit. Gauri Singh? Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, do you speak Hindi? Are you a student? Yes, ma'am. Don't be nervous. I'm not your teacher. Okay, so, we are doing a dating scan for you today. - Go and lie down. Simi? - Sure, Doctor. Gauri, over here, please. Thank you. - Ready? - Yes, Doctor. Just relax. Your pregnancy is still at the early stages. I can… I can barely see the embryo. So… the pregnancy is 100% confirmed? Oh yes. You are definitely pregnant. Why? Were you not expecting it? Ma'am, I'm not married yet. Have you told anyone? No. Are you two getting married? Keeping the baby? Okay, I'm done. - Simi, will you clear her up, please? - Sure, Doctor. So, what would you like to do about the baby? Okay. You don't have to decide right now. Talk to your family and then come back to us. Ma'am, is an operation needed for the abortion? No, actually. How far is she, Simi? Six weeks. Okay, so up to eight weeks, I can give you pills. So we can go for a medication abortion. It will be pretty safe and effective. - And, how old…? - Twenty. Okay, you will have to take some counseling sessions before the actual abortion. All right? Gauri, that's it. Thank you, Doctor. Ma'am, I don't know what it's like to be a mother. How does it feel to be a mother? Well, there's no right or wrong about it. If you don't like it, there is no judgment. Ma'am, are you a mother? How did you feel when you found out you were pregnant? Like yours, my pregnancy was unexpected. You weren't married? We didn't want a child so soon. Then? Then what? We had a girl. Do you have a girl? Um, Gauri, I think the next patient is waiting. - Please bring them in. - Sure, yeah. Okay. Sorry. Being a mother is neither good nor bad. There is a lot more to it. Okay. Thank you. Customers don't care about your problems. They just want the food on time. All I am saying is don't leave the shop to that Krishna alone. Who else will work for such a small wage? What's wrong with him? I'll help. - Oh, thank you. - Very cute child. How was your day? Same-same. How was yours? Business as usual. Keeps your mind off things. Shall we eat out today? Okay. Shall we go to Rumi's favorite place? No, I don't think that's a… Sorry? I don't think that's a good idea. Let's go. It will be fun. When Rumi was around, we went every weekend. That's why I don't want to go there, Maanav. How long can we run? We can't be just running away from our problems. Peeku will be back from school soon. He must be starving. And your daughter shirks all responsibility. She only bothers about herself, and herself alone. And you, why don't you keep an eye on her? You wanted her to work here. I'm too busy to keep an eye on her. It is good she is working here. We can barely afford one helper. Where's the money for a second? School was over at 1:00 p.m. Where were you? Papa, there was an extra module for baking. Princess wants to learn baking. - All lies. - Go help her. We must prepare for dinner. Let me do it. Move your hands faster. There is no caking baking here. Aren't you getting late? I'm leaving. You keep chewing betel nuts while your daughter fools around under your nose. - Who was staring at us, Maanav? - Everyone! Like we are some criminals. But I didn't see anybody. That's because you were on your phone. And how do they know us? Singapore is an island. Everyone knows everyone. That is why I said… "Let's not come here." But you insisted. "Let's go there, let's go there." Now see. I was missing Rumi. Is that a crime? "Time heals everything." Whoever said that, let them face me. It has been three years. Nothing has changed. Even if you try to forget, people won't let you. Can you forget? Because I can't. And we have to… We have to face the truth someday. What truth? That… That she wasn't a happy child. Shame unto you. How can you even talk like that? Then, why did she leave us? What about us? Why are we still here? Krish… I'm pregnant. Why are you looking at me like that? I am serious. I am actually pregnant. I went to see the doctor yesterday. What did the doctor say? The doctor said I am pregnant and she showed me the ultrasound report. But we both used protection all the time what. It didn't work. Crap. So what do we do? I don't know. Okay, never mind. Tomorrow we go find the doctor again. We ask for more tests. Okay? What? I just told you I went to see the doctor and she said I am pregnant. This is my baby. This is our baby. Okay, so what do you want to do? I… I think I want to keep my baby. Huh? You go talk to Mr. Raj first, yeah? I don't want to talk to him. Gauri, this kind of thing, you need to talk to him. If you want to talk to him, you can talk to him, right? I don't, please. How can I be the one talking to him? You need to talk to him. Krish, I really don't want to talk to him, please. I just want to marry you. I just want to marry you, that's it. I can't talk to him. Yeah, but you haven't even finished IT yet. Like that you want to marry? It's damn crazy, yo. I thought you wanted to marry me. Yeah, of course, I want to marry you. I love you. Then what's the problem? The problem is, I've got no savings. With what your dad pays me, how can I look after you and a child? Okay, if that's the problem, we can find a solution for that. I can get a job later. Like, after I finish my college, I can actually get a job. Mr. Ong says I am a very good baker, so he can help me find a good employer. We can make this work and then we can also have a good place after that. Yeah, but do you think you can do all this without your parents? Yeah. Aren't you ashamed? You're arguing with me. What happened? Look what came out of her working at the shop. Terrible at studies. No interest in school. We spend so much money on your education. How long has this been going on? What has she done? I am asking you. Why are you standing like a statue? Speak up! Krishna and I want to marry. What? Marry? You will marry! Didn't I tell you? What are you doing? Papa, no. I'll call the police if you hit me again. Marry that servant?! Live with that darkie? Bring that servant to my house? Papa! He can find another job. Is he royalty now? Can't work at my shop? - Stop it! - Move aside. Keep your voice down. Don't hit her. You will scar her face. Straighten her out. Go from here. I'll see to Krishna. You will call the police? You're here, Gauri. That's why you are acting like a tigress. In the village, you'd have been fixed in two days. Ill-mannered brat. Get out! Sir, what did I do? - Rascal! You touched my daughter! - What do you mean? - Who do you think you are? - I didn't do anything. A salary of 1200! And you betray the same people who feed you. Get lost! Get out, rascal! Fine. Get lost! Finish your food. I don't want. I want peanut butter. Gauri didi always gives me peanut butter. That's finished. Eat this for now. Gauri? She can hear everything, but won't step out of her room. I wish my mother was around. Then this wouldn't have happened. Okay. Don't cry. Everything will be all right. Don't cry. Yeah, so, I left my house and I'm living in Jurong shelter. Do your parents know you are living there? I think Nancy may have told them. - I see. - Nancy is a caseworker. - Oh. - Yeah. Nancy. What should I do? I don't know. How can I tell you? It's your decision. If you want to keep the child, I can help you. If you don't want to keep the child, I can help you in that also. But it has to be your decision. Is it okay if I… If I call you sometime? Can I have your number, please? Please? I don't think that's a very good idea, Gauri. I don't think the Shelter Home people would like that. If you need any help, I think you can always call the caseworker, right? Yeah. Yes. Talk to your caseworker. Here is something you can do. Talk to your boyfriend once again. Then decide together. Come back in a day or two. Okay? Should I get the next patient in? Simi, I did the right thing, I… I couldn't give her my number, right? I think you did the right thing. Let Nancy handle it, and you shouldn't get too involved. But she is really attached to you, huh? Go get a… Maybe go to the canteen or something, okay? Oh, you want… - You want to go out somewhere? - Where? I don't know. Did you like the lunch? Hey, want some grapes lah? Take some grapes lah. You should have given her your phone number. Maybe she just needed some assurance. She trusts you. And then? If she got into some kind of trouble and calls me? I will have to respond, no? No, you don't. Of course I do. I can't not respond without feeling guilty, no? You just let the caseworker know, no? That's not how these things work. I just don't want to get involved. In any case, what's the point of telling you this? Of course. I don't understand these things. I'm the cold-blooded banker, after all. - You know what? - What? I don't even know you anymore. The woman I knew would walk that extra mile for her patients. They called you late at night. Sent you gifts on Diwali. Rumi and I used to… Rumi! Rumi! Rumi! Why do you have to bring her into every conversation? Can you just stop doing that, Maanav? That girl is trying to reach out to you. She does not want to keep it inside. I don't care. And… And the woman you knew is no more. Fine. Then stay where you are and keep wondering why Rumi left without telling us. Hey, finished already or not? Faster can or not, faster, faster. I want to go home already. Is this our test report? That's… that's our child. Krish, if I abort this child, will you still love me? Of course, Gauri. I'm very, very lucky to have you, okay? I don't care whether you want this child or not. I will always love you. I just… I just wish I could get both of us a house. But we will get a home, Krish. We will get a home. Please. We will. We will. I… My heart says to keep this child but… but then my mind says no. I don't know. Listen to your mind, Gauri. You're saying that because you don't love our child. No, that's not true. It is true. You don't… - Of course I do. - No. I just cannot afford it. Gauri, I just cannot afford it. Maybe you can listen to your heart. Gauri… Our type of people lah cannot afford to listen to heart what. - Simi. - Yes, Doctor? Can you complete the formalities, please? - Sure. Okay. - Good. So can I ask you, Gauri, when was the last time you met with your counselor? Last week Friday. Okay. Okay, so Dr. Radhika will be here with all the formalities soon. Do you have any other questions for me? No? All right. Oh, and Nancy, your counselor, will come and see you soon. Okay. Okay. Don't be scared. You are in very capable hands, and Dr. Radhika is the best. Okay? Anything else? No? Okay. Doctor, she is all yours. Thank you. Okay. So this is what you do. You take one pill right now. That will prepare your cervix for the termination. And then, after 48 hours, take the other pill, and that will terminate your pregnancy. In this period, you are going to have some bleeding. You may get some nausea. Some vomiting as well. Just stay indoors and look after yourself. Gauri? Gauri, are you okay? Are you all right? - Gauri… - Sorry. Sorry, I just, I can't do this. I'm so sorry. Gauri… Okay. Gauri… Someone is here to see you. Who? You can come and see for yourself. Who is it? Come! - Stop staring at your phone all day. - I don't want to go. You should come. Think over it one more time. You have time. Do you know? The more I think, the more I cry. The same thought haunts me. If I am not around, who will care? No one needs me. I am not required. Gauri… Don't ever think like that. All right? I will… I will never… I will never make my baby feel this way. Ever. This… this helplessness, this… And… I've had to do everything alone so far. No one helped me. No one. I can do this alone too. All your life? How old are you, after all? And your studies? And that… passion that you had for… What was it? Baking. I will do it. I can do it. I can. There are so many women who manage both. A child and a career. Why can't I manage both? Why does everyone want me to abort this child? I don't understand. I have no one else besides this child. No one! And this child… has no one besides me, right? So you won't change your mind? You will have this child? Okay. Do as you wish. But listen. Spare me all this thing about, "I have no one besides this child. The child has no one but me." Where is the father? What's his name? Krishna. Does he know you are doing this? Gauri… The child needs both parents. This is not some old Hindi film where the mother feeds the child and the father just shows love. Where is he? What does he do? He is in Malaysia. He will be back in two weeks. Okay. Bring him to me when he comes next. All right? Now, smile. We will have to bear the insults. Her deeds are such… I'm not allowed to speak anyway. Stay quiet. Why bring me here, then? Didn't I tell you? A mother's duties… They are here. Hi. Ah, would you like some water? - No, madam. - No. How are you? Fine. Mr. Rajender Singh, Mrs. Kalpana Singh. In our previous meeting, we had agreed that the best place for Gauri is her own home. And, I am here to confirm that you have made the necessary arrangements for that. Madam, no home. She stays shelter. We give money, rent, for shelter. That's not how it works, Mr. Singh. The shelter is only a temporary arrangement until we find a solution. In our previous meeting, we agreed on that. What's she talking about? Gauri wants to come home. Now she wants to come home? She ran away on her own. Let me talk. Don't spoil the conversation. Gauri has decided to keep the child, and you cannot coerce her or pressure her to do otherwise. That would be illegal. Madam, no child. It's Gauri's right. Madam, she's not ready. Madam, she child only. You not know. She child only, madam. She not have child. She's a grown woman who can decide for herself. What? Gauri wants to keep the child. What? And who will look after the child? She should have thought of that before making the baby. - Not you. - Will you keep quiet? - Look at how she talks. - Let me handle this. Madam, that child cannot be born. Sorry. No child, she come home. Child, she not come home, madam. Papa, I'm keeping the child. - Gauri… - Look at her arrogance. You listen to me. Madam, please understand. She not have child. She have child, she not come home. Papa, I have to keep this child. Gauri, please try to understand. First, you bring dishonor to us. Now, you're arguing with me. The… the court has issued a personal protection order against Mrs. Kalpana Singh. What is this? What are you up to? She reported you to the police. Aren't you ashamed? Why did you do that? What? Aren't you ashamed of what you did to Krishna? You falsely labeled him a thief! Then go back to him. Why are you after us? No manners! Look at that sharp tongue. I'm not talking to you. I'm not talking to you. Keep quiet. Just shut up! - Just shut up. - Both of you, calm down. - She's a witch. - Stop that. - How are you talking to your mom? - Please calm down. Can we talk about this, in a calm manner? - I'll not stay with her for a minute. - I don't want to, either. - A thief is a thief! - Gauri. - Keep quiet. - You keep your mouth shut. Please. Can we please calm down? Look, I know it's not easy, but her time at the shelter has come to an end. It's no place for a new mother. Madam. I won't live here for long. I just need a place to live for a few days. That is my home too. My mother's home. It is my home. Papa, a few days. Gauri, it's not too late. Think it over. It is too late, Papa. Please bear in mind that if we receive any more complaints against Mrs. Kalpana Singh, we will have to take the matter to the law. She is only 20 years old. But, such willpower. She left the clinic saying, "I won't abort the child." Not unlike you, is she? Remember, Manaav, the day Rumi was born? Premature. 30 weeks. Doctors said, "Impossible." "Born too soon. She'll require a miracle." But I said… she'll live. Feels good to see the old Radhika. Looks like my words have had some impact after all. Gauri said something today. What? She said, "When I think too much, I cry too much. So, I have stopped thinking." After Rumi left, we've also been doing the same. Gauri? You can ask Mr. Ong to write you a cert to get you a job. He wrote one for Jamie. A friend of mine started a café. But it's in the Central Clarke Quay area. He is looking for a baking assistant. What's the pay? Normal rate I guess. Can ask if you want? But Clarke Quay is so far. What with the baby and all? You know what? I think I am just going to head back in first. What's wrong with her? I don't know. The smoke, maybe? Not good for the baby, I guess. Hey, I thought you said you're not going to keep the child. Are you marrying me because you love me or you don't want the child? Hey, of course I love you, but you know the situation, don't you? I get scolded by my boss here, you know? He's threatening to kick me out because, you know, my English cannot make it. So I am going to Malaysia every week to earn extra money lah. Then you say I am not spending enough time with you, looking after you, and we already got all these problems, and you still want to have this child. I've got no peace in my life, you know, Gauri! I already said I am marrying you already. What more you want? - So, are you doing me a favor? - That's not what I said. No, are you doing me a favor by marrying me, then? What are you saying then, Krish? You always talk about your peace, right? "I want my peace." But then what about my peace? Do you know anything what is happening in my life? Okay, it's all about this child. I get it. What do you want from me? I don't want your pity. I just don't want your pity. - Hey, come back lah, Gauri, hey. - And you know what? I don't see the love in your eyes anymore. I really don't see that love, Krish. You know, you are giving me the exact same look that Papa gives me. The exact same look and I… I've really suffered long with him. Hey, come back lah, Gauri. Gauri! Where have you put my things? Where are my things? What things? You know very well. Where are my things? I don't know. What do you mean? My mother gave them to me. Where have you put them? Peeku needed more space, so I created it. How can you just touch my things? How dare you touch my things? How dare you touch my things? Can you hear me at all? It's useless talking to you! I feel suffocated in this house. Call the police. Have you seen my doll? I am a thief Stole a bit of scent from the air Take care, okay? Stole a bit of childhood from Momma Where are you going? Her sweet memories - Where are you going? - Leave me alone. Gauri! Papa, I'd rather die than come back to this house. Hey! Gauri! Come back! I am a thief. Stole a bit of perfume from the air Stole a few verses from a poem And some waves from the sea Some money from Papa Loose change And some of his thoughts Stole a bit of childhood from Momma Some sweet memories of her Plucked a cloud from the sky And a few stars from the night Dust from the earth Some flowers from the balcony Tied them in a bundle The journey is very long And memories are My only companion We had to move on. How long will we keep holding onto her? I hope you're right. I hope so too. Let's go. You need to go to your clinic. I don't feel like going. Then, I will leave for work. So easy for you, no? Hold on to your work. It keeps me sane, Radhi. Any more patients, Simi? No, we are done for the day. So what happened to Gauri? I thought I called her today. Gauri? Was she due? Yes. Yeah, she was. So? Did you check with Nancy, the caseworker? I don't think Nancy would know. Somebody should call her. Call the shelter home. - Call her home. Figure out where she is. - Okay. She can't disappear from the face of the earth. Find out where she is, Simi. Hi, is that Nancy? This is Simi from the clinic. Is Gauri there with you, or do you know where she is? Can't reach her. Don't worry. All will be well. "All will be well." That's what you always say. "All will be well." And then nothing goes well! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Maanav. I shouldn't have burst like that. I'm sorry. It's okay. No. No, Rumi. Please, no. - Please, let me go. - No. Rumi, no. - Hello, Radhika, ma'am. - Yes? There is a young woman who is here to see you. Young woman? Yes, ma'am. Her name is Gauri. Gauri? Did you say Gauri? Yes, ma'am. Gauri. Gauri? Where were you? We've been looking for you for the past four days. Gauri? Are you okay? Gauri. Come inside. Come in. Come in. Good morning. Good morning. How are you, Gauri? I'm okay. Feeling better? Thank you for letting me stay. Thank you very much. The state you came in… Where were you all these days? I will leave in a day or two. You've only just come and already you are talking about leaving? We'll talk about this later. - Freshen up. - Okay. Hot breakfast is ready. You must be hungry. Here. I will see you outside. Ma'am. Gauri. Good morning. Good morning, sir. Radhika is on a call. Your breakfast is ready. Maybe it's already cold. I'll get it warmed… No… I actually need some paste. - Paste? - Toothpaste. Of course. Thank you. Here you go. Thank you, sir. Just ask if you need anything else. Put your stuff in Rumi's cabinet. She won't mind. Keep away from her keyboard. Rumi doesn't like anyone touching it. Rumi? Our daughter. Is she at school? She's not here. Where is she? She's not with us anymore. Left too soon. Any problems in her room? No. Thank you. I hope Rumi doesn't mind. We gave her room to Gauri. Did she tell you what happened? All in good time. She was in quite a state. She must have gone through a lot. Inform her parents. Had they cared, this wouldn't have happened at all. How can people not care? Anyway, we don't want any trouble with the police. I am not talking to those people. I will let her caseworker know. I told her about Rumi. What? Everything? Why? She is my patient, Maanav. But she lives here. How long can we hide it? You can do it. I can't. I haven't told her everything. This is my first time having Hokkien Mee. - How was it? - It's okay lah. Singaporean food, bro. I think it takes a while. You need three or four times to be… Okay, you like it. Krishna? I am Radhika, Gauri's doctor. Can I speak to you for a few minutes, please? Bro, personal matter. Okay. - You know Gauri? - Yeah? She is very stressed. This Gauri. She's got no respect for me. I already told her a lot of times already I am going to marry her. But she don't listen to me. She don't trust me. She don't respect me. - But will you marry her? - Yes, of course, I am going to marry her. I already told her a lot of times. Can you marry her now, before she has her child? You know, she… She can't raise her child alone. The child, she decided on her own she wanted it. She never asked me. I know it is not easy for you, Krishna. In fact, it will be much easier for you to say no and walk away. But I think you're… You are better than that. Ma'am, you know how hard it is for me? It's very easy to say, "Oh, I want to support her." But I've got three mouths to feed and not enough income. And I don't want my child to live in poverty like me. I can apply for a house but I need to wait because not enough income. Then, my previous boss, he fired me because he wants better English. So I asked Gauri to wait lah. But she don't want to listen to me. She don't trust me and she don't respect me as well. But she loves you. Do you love her? You know what her father did to me? He called me a thief. He say I steal money from him. Our Indian community is already so small. Everybody knows everybody. He still want to go like that. Now, they all think I am dishonest. But do you love her? Ma'am, it's very easy for you to come down here and give your advice. But your type of problem and my type of problem is very different. I one month struggle to earn how much that amount, you like that one day can earn already. So, please… My daughter died. She was 17. You know how she died? She committed suicide. It has been three years and not a single day goes by when I… don't think about… how it happened. Why it happened. She didn't tell anybody about it. Not me, not her dad, not friends, her teachers. But it doesn't matter now. She is not coming back. No amount of money is going to bring her back. You have got somebody who loves you. That's all that matters. Nothing else matters. Nothing else. You sing well. Where did you learn? I just sing. I haven't learned music. Rumi was also very fond of music. She used to write too. In Hindi and English. And compose. She inherited her musical talent from her grandmother. But she didn't sing. She had a band with friends. You wanted her to be a musician? She had a mind of her own. We never asked what she wanted. Maybe we should have asked her. Her songs are in this notebook. Let me show you. Notebook? - Where is her notebook? - I… I made space for my notebooks. Let me give you her notebook. Sorry, I didn't… I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I… Should we wait for her? You start. She will join us. Did you tell her? Why don't you start? Let her come. What was all that interrogation in her room? What interrogation? "Where is Rumi's notebook? Why did you move them?" It's her room. Let her be the way she wants to. That is Rumi's room and it will always be. Mr. Sehgal, can I have an extra key to the main door? I need to come back earlier. There is no Mr. Sehgal here. She is Dr. Radhika Sehgal and I am Maanav Sharma. Mr. Sharma? Call me "Uncle." Even at work, no one calls me Mr. Sharma. Should we give her Rumi's keys? - Thank you so much. - Going to college? Actually, college resumes in a month. So, I have taken a job. Really? Great. Where? It's at Orchard at a café. - Wow, that's awesome. - Yes. Shall we go? On that silent night, I was on the terrace My sail was full Wings appeared And I began to fly Higher, higher, higher Like leaves flying off the trees Before rains Like stars flying off the sky before dawn Like memories flying off the heart Before death Good evening! Wow. I made something special today. The sugar level is good? Ask her about sugar levels. I'm good with everything. It's really nice. Very well done. Today we learned how to make pumpkin bread. You mean Kaddu bread? Should I make it for you on Saturday? No, spare me. Go ahead! You're always like that. Cheating! I have no cards! I feel some connection. It's not what you feel. It's what you want to feel. Raymond Kwan. The Raymond Kwan? Yeah? Do you know him? Let me drop you off. I can go on my own. It's not a problem. Let her be. She wants to meet her boyfriend. Next time he comes to you, just ignore him. Act like you don't care. Don't answer him. Okay. Then, he'll run around you. An old remedy. Never fails. What? Remedy. Let's do this. If I like your pumpkin bread, I'll connect you with Raymond. Okay, done. This Saturday, pumpkin bread just for you. Challenge accepted. And, here you go. Pumpkin bread. Want some? Send them a message. They are your parents. They'll like that. There are few good people like you and Uncle. If they cared even a bit, they would send one message. One message! There's nothing. They just… they don't care. Sometimes, people understand everything yet they make a mistake. All her ties broke Even those within her from eternity She had nothing to lose Her path was clear as water Cascading like velvety sugars She twirls like a tornado Spinning on the floor A manic dance Bursts of a million rays Time vanishes into shapes in the mind Phantoms that lay dormant Now bubble up She saw all this The day she became a bird And flew in the sky One day Your newborn, bro? Yeah, just two hours old. Eyes are not opened also. Doesn't look like you. I told my wife. She really mad at me. So, when you going back? Not before Hari Raya, bro. By that time, he will be almost six months. Just go. I will cover for you. No. I'm all right. It's okay, just go. Do I need to talk with the boss? I will talk to the boss for you. I will manage. Do you think he will allow? Bro. It's okay, bro. Are you sure? Yes. But you need to help me ask your wife something. What? Who's the father? Radhika, you have a… Thank you. Why are you ignoring Rumi's friends from her music group? They are planning a musical evening for her. You know how important it was for her, right? You want to go? You go. I don't want to go. Get this load off your chest. So easy for you. What do you mean? Nothing. No, I'm serious. What do you mean by that? Work is where you escape. Get busy and work. That's how you deal with these things. Isn't that what you've done ever since Rumi left? I don't like to show my wounds to people. Maanav? Maanav! Maanav! Maanav! What happened, Radhi? She is gone. - Who is gone? - She's gone. - Who is gone? - She is gone. - Who was here? Who left? - She is gone. - Radhi? - She is gone. - Who is gone? - She is gone. - Radhi. - She is gone. Radhi! Radhika! Have you lost your mind?! What are you doing? Rumi is gone, Maanav. Rumi is gone. Get a hold on yourself. I tried to stop her, but she is gone. I know she is gone. I know it. She jumped from here and killed herself. I am with you. I don't care. - It doesn't matter to you? - It doesn't. - It doesn't? - It doesn't. You were with her in her final moments. I wasn't even there. You are never there Maanav. And I… I couldn't do anything despite being a doctor. Stop blaming yourself. You're not responsible for her death. - Stop blaming us. - Who should I blame, then?! Who should I blame? Tell me. She was not a happy child. You don't say that Maanav. Please, you don't say that. You know that, no? That's the truth. She was in depression. You knew it. We knew it. We could have saved her, Maanav. We have blamed ourselves for three years. Maybe we could have saved her. We could have saved her. I could have saved her. I could have saved her. I could have saved her, Maanav. We tried. We tried, Radhi. We tried saving her. But we couldn't. We are not responsible for her death. She didn't think even once about what would happen to us. How will we stay alive? She didn't care about us. Didn't she think even once about us? If she didn't, we can't blame her all our lives. We have to forgive her. If we are alive, there has to be a reason for that. Is this Gauri Singh's home? Careful, it's hot. That coaster was designed by me. I studied fashion design in India. That's in the past. Forgotten, ever since I came here. Children take up all our time. - Greet your Aunty. - Hello. What is your name, child? Tell her your name. My name is Peeku. Do you miss Gauri didi? We don't talk about Gauri didi. Peeku, go inside. Go inside. What's he doing among elders? Oh. Ma'am, have you been here for many years? Are you a Singaporean citizen now? Yes. Do you have the red passport? He also has one. And your clinic? Is that your own? Yes. I was asking you because my sister back in India is also in the medical profession. Her name is Kavita. She is Kavita. I am Kalpana. My Kavita is very professional. Tell us if you need an assistant. We will bring her here. Why don't you want to talk about Gauri? Why pay attention to that child? He talks nonsense. Yes, madam. We're ready to talk. But she doesn't come here. Others do. Police, special services, and… Social service. I know… social service. I know them. I live here with you, don't I? I am the one dealing with those people. You are always at the shop. Why are you ashamed? Is it her pregnancy or her leaving this house? Ashamed? We are not ashamed. Why did she leave, then? It was her wish. That girl doesn't listen to me or talk to me. Just like the people here. It's a daily affair. When she gets back from college, she shuts herself in her room. I worry about her needs, asking her this or that. "Are you all right? Do you need anything?" No response. Instead, she WhatsApp's me from her room. You're her mother. Didn't you try to find out why she behaved that way? I'm her stepmother. Why, madam? Do I look that old to you? That's the problem. She is always jealous of me. She fears I have come here to oust her. Is that... Stop it. Enough. Okay, I'll stop. No matter how much I sacrifice, a stepmother will always be a stepmother. Just because I scold her, she runs away? She lived on the streets for four nights. You didn't ask around or look for her? As though our asking would bring her back. She doesn't listen to us or care. This is Singapore. It's safe here, isn't it? She will soon turn 21. Then she can do as she pleases. May I look at Gauri's room? Room? Let me show you. I will show it to her. What happened? They didn't spare an inch of space for her. Not once did they ask about her well-being. All they cared about was… Does Gauri live with you? Yes. It was Gauri who left this house. You don't know her. She has a lot of airs. She's lazy to the bone. And she's demanding. "I won't live with my mother. I want a child. I will marry Krishna." He worked at my shop for 1200 dollars. Now, he doesn't even have that. If she aborts her child, she can come back anytime. You know, Maanav… Gauri needs us. She has no one besides us. You know she can stay with us. Yeah, but for how long? We are not her parents. Why don't we ask her? Maybe she wants this? And fears asking us? That's not how these things work. You're complicating matters. Look. All I know is that she likes us and we are fond of her. Gauri told me something. That she will give her child the love she never got from her parents. We'll see what love she gives to her child. She will have to come back here. Don't worry about her. She will find her way. As for her future, she doesn't need your crutches to lean on. Thank you. Then, we have to tell her the truth about Rumi. We will tell her. What's the hurry? I can't start this on a lie. We shouldn't be… we shouldn't be doing this. We should just tell her the truth. Please, Maanav? For Rumi? Please. Okay. Hi, sir. Can I please have your order? Just five minutes with you. Sir, there are other people waiting in the line. Please, Gauri. Just five minutes. Sir, I end my shift at 5:00 p.m. Then I go home. Okay, two minutes. What is it? My boss said I can apply for a house already. I have a permanent job now. Sir, there are other people waiting in the line. - Hi, ma'am. How can I help you? - Hi! What's in the Dark Matter? In Dark Matter? Well, there is milk chocolate, caramel, and hazelnut. Oh, you have some pastries! Yeah, we do. What's the house special? Croissant. - Could I have one of those too, please? - Of course, okay. You may take your seat. I will get that for you. Thank you so much. Wow, this is such a beautiful place! Happy Birthday! Happy birthday. Close your eyes now. - What? - Close your eyes, we have a surprise. Can I open…? Wait, and… now. Raymond, that's the birthday girl, Gauri. Maanav. Radhika. Gauri. - Hi. - Happy 21st! Thank you. So, Gauri. That's how I pronounce your name, right? - Yeah. - Gauri. Now, Maanav here tells me that you are in your final year at culinary school. Yes, I end in two months. And I understand that you want to work in this kitchen with me. Her pumpkin bread is delicious. Is that right? Well, we will have to see, won't we? So tell me, Gauri, why do you want to work in my kitchen? Chef, I am your biggest fan and, like… And I love to bake. Like, baking is my passion and I am your biggest fan, so… Why? Chef, I have read all your books and… and, you know, you have made me a better chef, a better person, and… and I know you started from nothing. You did it all by yourself. You know, Gauri, it's… It's one thing to want to be someone. It's another to love yourself for it. Come. Let me tell you something. And this is the part you are going to hate, all right? It's no fun being in that kitchen. It's long hours. It's back-breaking. The pay sucks. And… To put it bluntly, no one cares about your job. No one cares about you. All they want is the food and pronto. So why do it? I'll tell you why. Because you cannot imagine doing anything else in the world. You'd rather be in that hot mess on a Sunday afternoon than out on a beach with your boyfriend. Now, when you love something that much you know you have it in you. Do you have that much love to give to something? Yes, Chef, I do. I really do. Good. You're going to need it because… you are going to be an intern with Anu, my Boulanger. You are going to spend six months as one of her commis chef, and if she likes you, if she likes you, and you're not dead yet… we'll… we'll send you to Paris for another six months. What do you say? - Paris? - Six months of pure hell. All expenses paid, of course. I can't do it, though. It's a great opportunity. I really want to, but I can't. Why not? I have to take care of my baby. I have to take care of my baby. Well… You know what, Gauri? If you really want it bad, I believe that you will find a way to do it. And no one can take that away from you. You want it bad? Don't think about it. Say yes! Yes, Chef. More than anything in the world. Great. Get in touch with me when you are ready to start and we'll see how we can make it happen. All right? - Enjoy the cake. I made it myself. - Thank you so much. It's lovely. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Happy? We have to ask you something, Gauri. I also have to tell you something. You go first. Is it about your pregnancy? We already know that. The other day, Krishna came to see me. He wants to marry me. His job now is permanent. That's… that's very… That's great news. Now we can apply for a new house. Did… Did you say yes? Yes. I hope you didn't try my remedy. No, I said yes. I said yes. Well done. Should we eat this cake now? Yes. Somebody get us some spoons, please? Sure, ma'am, right away. What were you going to say? Does Krishna speak Hindi? No, not at all. Then, start learning Tamil. I wanted to tell you one more thing. Now, what's new? I read… I read Rumi's diary and I know what she did. I… I am not going to tell this to anyone. Look, I promise. I promise I won't. I… It's all right. Sorry. Now, Rumi has become… a part of you. I'm sorry. You leave me breathless But not in that way No, my lungs choke out All the plusses away What I think you're saying's Not what's been said It morphs the words And flips it over again And makes it pierce Through me I let it pierce I let it pierce Through me Yeah, let me breathe I'm stuck in my head Keep climbing up for air I'm stuck in my head I'll try the ladder again In over my head Sending me nowhere back over again… First, Rumi left us. Now, Gauri has too. Sometimes I wonder… Why did Rumi come into our lives when she had to leave? We give them roots. We give them wings. She grew her wings and flew away. We can give birth to them, nurture them, and help them grow. What else? It's an act of faith, Maanav. Getting late for school. Eat your peanut butter sandwich. Thank you. Finish it. Yeah. Nice, huh? Buy for me. It's all so pretty, right? Yeah. Can we eat now? Why you always just eat, eat, eat? Look, I know you've got a lot of food, okay? Then, this also need to cut lah to your size. Yeah, just cut it. Krish, he knows everything and he is still not here. He didn't even come to the hospital, right? But I feel like we need them more than they need us. I don't. You know, sometimes people know that they are wrong, but cannot change really what. I am the last person to defend him, by the way. So, what do you think? Should Momma go to Paris or not? Then who will take care of you? "Papa will take care of me. Six months only, what?" I don't want to leave you alone. "I am not alone. I'm with Papa." I will not have any time for you in Paris. "Oh, so you want me, but you want to go Paris at the same time?" Can we have both? Why not? Why not? Why not?
