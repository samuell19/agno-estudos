PeG@SuS Urang Sunda Asli WELL, HURLEY, WHAT ARE YOUR GENERAL RACING PLANS FOR THIS SEASON? WELL, THEY'RE STILL A BIT UP IN THE AIR. I'M GONNA BE DRIVING WITH PETER IN ALL THE ENDURANCE RACES, AND, AND... Hurley: I WAS ALWAYS SORT OF DESCRIBED AS, I THINK, PRETTY QUIET. I'VE GOT A SUPER-V RIDE, AND OTHER THAN THAT, PLANS HAVE NOT BEEN TOTALLY FINALIZED. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS YEAR? I WAS SUPER SHY. I MEAN, I WAS REALLY, REALLY SHY WHEN I FIRST STARTED. I WOULD JUST ALMOST THROW UP IF I HAD TO GET IN FRONT OF A MICROPHONE. JUST, I HATED IT. WE'RE PLANNING RIGHT NOW DRIVING FOUR HOURS ON AND FOUR HOURS OFF. THAT GIVES US A LOT OF TIME TO REST OR SLEEP OR WHATEVER. OKAY. - THANKS SO MUCH. - YEP. Hurley: SOMETIMES I EVEN WOULD THINK ABOUT DRIVING OFF THE RACETRACK SO WE WOULDN'T WIN SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GET UP IN FRONT OF THE MICROPHONE. THE VERY FIRST TIME I GOT INTO A RACE CAR, I THINK MY CORE GROUP OF PEOPLE KNEW WHAT MY STORY WAS, BUT AS LONG AS I WAS ABLE TO HOLD MY FOOT DOWN LONGER THAN THE GUY NEXT DOOR TO ME, THAT'S WHAT ANYBODY LOOKED AT. France: BACK IN THE EARLY '70s, HURLEY WAS LIKE A SUPERHERO. HE DROVE PORSCHES. HE WON RACES. HE DID THINGS THAT NOBODY ELSE HAD EVER DONE. Posey: HE COULD TAKE A CAR OUT, ANY CAR, AND DRIVE IT RIGHT AT THE LIMIT. Busby: HE JUST WAS THE REAL DEAL. IF YOU'D EVER CAST A RACING-CAR DRIVER IN A MOVIE, IT WOULD BE HURLEY HAYWOOD. Long: HE'S KIND OF THE ESSENCE OF COOL. THEN, AS YOU SPEND MORE TIME AND YOU GET TO KNOW HURLEY, YOU KIND OF ARE HIT WITH SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE STORIES OR THE PHOTOS TELL. HURLEY HAS A CURIOUS PLACE IN RACING HISTORY BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND IS A SIZZLING-HOT RACING DRIVER, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS THE ANTITHESIS OF THAT. IT'S ALMOST LIKE, HOW DID HE DO THIS? IT'S NOT EASY TO TALK ABOUT. WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS TO ANYBODY PUBLICLY. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS I ALWAYS LOVED COMING HERE. THE FIRST TIME I CAME THROUGH THE TUNNEL WAS IN 1969. I'VE BEEN HERE ALMOST EVERY YEAR SINCE. THEY'LL RACE FOR 24 HOURS AND MORE THAN 2,500 MILES. PRODUCTION CARS AND PROTOTYPES -- THE 24 HOURS OF DAYTONA. Hurley: IT'S JUST A GREAT FEELING. I LOVE THIS PLACE. IT'S LIKE FAMILY. TO ME, HURLEY HAYWOOD IS A LEGEND, WITHOUT QUESTION. HE CAME INTO THE SPORT AND DOMINATED THROUGH THE '70s AND '80s AND HAS WON IN ANY TYPE OF CAR HE COULD DRIVE. I HEARD ABOUT HURLEY WELL BEFORE I MET HIM, WHICH WAS VERY EARLY ON IN MY RACING CAREER, AND I APPROACHED HIM. BUT I GOT A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE OF WHAT HE'S ACHIEVED, NOT ONLY ON THE TRACK BUT OFF THE TRACK. SO WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT WE WERE GONNA RACE AT DAYTONA AND HAVE BRUMOS LIVERY ON THE CAR AND THEN HURLEY AS A MENTOR, YOU KNOW, IT WAS VERY SPECIAL. HOW ARE YOU? MORNING, GUYS. HOW'S IT GOING? ALL THE TEAMS PRETTY MUCH SET UP TO OPERATE OVER A 24-HOUR PERIOD OF TIME. THE PITS HAVE GOT ALL THE TOOLS, TIRES, EVERYTHING YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE, GETTING READY FOR THE 24-HOUR RACE. SO THIS PRETTY MUCH IS WHERE WE'RE GONNA LIVE, RIGHT HERE, FOR 24 HOURS. THIS IS VICTORY LANE, SOMEPLACE THAT I'VE BEEN QUITE A FEW TIMES. IF YOU STAND ON THAT PLATFORM, YOU'VE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB. AN OPPORTUNITY CAME UP TO TEAM UP WITH JOHN WRIGHT AND PATRICK DEMPSEY. IT'S REALLY EXCITING FOR US AS A DEALERSHIP BRINGING BRUMOS BACK INTO THE RACING SCENE. BRUMOS RED-WHITE-AND-BLUE CARS HAVE BECOME AN ICON THAT'S RECOGNIZED ALL OVER THE WORLD. Dempsey: BRUMOS IS ON THE CAR, AND I HAD BEEN RACING AGAINST THAT CAR FOR SO MANY YEARS, BUT LIVERY'S BEEN AROUND SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING. THE CONSISTENCY YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT -- IT MAKES YOU WORK THAT MUCH HARDER. YOU WANT TO WIN BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT LEGACY. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND PORSCHE AND THE ATMOSPHERE OF HURLEY BEING THERE IN THE PITS. YOU HAVE EVERYTHING AT YOUR DISPOSAL TO WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS. SPOT CHECK... Hurley: WINNING THIS RACE IS SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL. IT'S A COMBINATION OF A LOT OF HARD WORK AND A LOT OF DISCIPLINE. I GUESS THE FACT THAT I'VE WON IT FIVE TIMES. THEY'VE GOT A LITTLE STAND OVER HERE, THE HURLEY HAYWOOD STAND, YEAH, RIGHT HERE. GREGG AND HAYWOOD -- THE LEGENDS OF DAYTONA, PRETTY COOL DEAL. Dempsey: WHEN YOU THINK OF BRUMOS, YOU THINK OF HURLEY AND HIS LEGACY. I MEAN, HE IS A QUINTESSENTIAL RACE-CAR DRIVER. BUT, YET, YOU LOOK AT HIM CLOSELY, THERE'S A VULNERABILITY THERE. HURLEY IS DIFFERENT. YOU KNOW, HE'S BEEN DIFFERENT SINCE THE MOMENT HE WAS BORN. HE ALSO JUST HAD AN ABILITY RIGHT AWAY. Hurley: I HAD ALL HAD A LOVE OF CARS WHEN I WAS JUST A SMALL KID. I STARTED DRIVING A FULL-SIZE CAR WHEN I WAS 12 YEARS OLD, SO I KNEW THE BASICS OF HOW TO DRIVE. HURLEY STARTED DRIVING, REALLY, WHEN WE WERE QUITE YOUNG BECAUSE, WELL, FIRST HE HAD A GO-CART. HE HAD TO SIT ON A CUSHION. HE COULD BARELY TOUCH, YOU KNOW, THE PEDALS. Hurley: MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, "WHEN YOU PUT YOUR HELMET ON, YOU'RE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON THAN YOU ARE WITHOUT YOUR HELMET ON." YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST KIND OF MY WAY OF SHIELDING MYSELF A LITTLE BIT. THE PAPERS EXAGGERATE. I WOULDN'T SAY WE WERE SOCIALITES, BUT, YEAH, WE DID THAT WHOLE DEBUT CIRCUIT. THREE TIMES A WEEK, THERE WERE HUGE PARTIES LIKE THAT. SO HURLEY WAS THE DRIVER. Hurley: WE WERE BROUGHT UP IN A LIFESTYLE THAT THERE WASN'T TOO MANY THINGS THAT WE WERE WITHOUT, SO WE WERE EXTREMELY LUCKY. AS KIDS, WE WERE ABLE TO DO A LOT OF TRAVELING TO EUROPE. WE DID A LOT OF THINGS THAT WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND YOU'RE ABLE TO BE SUBJECTED TO DIFFERENT CULTURES AND DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT CERTAIN THINGS, IT SORT OF BROADENS YOUR HORIZONS ON WHAT WAS -- WHAT YOU THOUGHT IMPORTANT AND WHAT YOU, YOU KNOW, LIKED AND DIDN'T LIKE. Hope: ALL MY GIRLFRIENDS WERE COMPLETELY IN LOVE WITH HURLEY, ALL OF THEM. SOMETIMES WHEN HURLEY WOULDN'T RECIPROCATE THEIR FEELINGS, THEY WOULD GET ANGRY, AND I'D BE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. Hurley: I WAS SUPER SHY. I MEAN, I WAS REALLY, REALLY SHY WHEN I FIRST STARTED RACING. I HAD NO REAL ROLE MODEL TO LOOK TO AND SAY, "OKAY, THAT'S WHO I WANT TO BE." AMONG THE BEST-KNOWN DRIVERS IN CURRENT COMPETITION IS PETER GREGG. FEW COMPETITORS HAVE RACED HARDER OR WON MORE HONORS ON THE TRACKS OF AMERICAN SPORTS-CAR RACING. WENT DOWN TO THE COLLEGE DOWN HERE AT J.U. I BROUGHT MY CAR WITH ME, WHICH WAS A REALLY FAST CORVETTE. IT SORT OF OPENED THE DOOR, IN MY EYES, TO MOTORSPORTS. THE ENGINEERS BELIEVE THAT THE ULTIMATE TEST OF A CAR'S TOTAL PERFORMANCE IS BEST DONE IN RACING. AN AFTERNOON'S AMUSEMENT TURNED INTO A LIFE AT SPEED FOR HURLEY HAYWOOD AFTER DEFEATING ALL COMERS, INCLUDING RACING CHAMPION AND BRUMOS PORSCHE OWNER PETER GREGG IN A LOCAL JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA, AUTOCROSS. Hurley: PETER WAS THE DOMINANT RACING DRIVER IN THE UNITED STATES FOR YEARS. OBVIOUSLY, HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS. I DIDN'T KNOW WHO HE WAS. HURLEY WON BY, LIKE, A TENTH OF A SECOND, AND SO DAD, YOU KNOW, THOUGHT HE WAS A REAL TALENTED DRIVER. Hurley: BUT HE CAME UP. HE WAS VERY FRIENDLY. HE SAID, "YOU HAVE TO BE PRETTY GOOD TO BEAT ME." PETER GREGG WAS, YOU KNOW -- THEY CALLED HIM "MR. PERFECT," "PETER PERFECT." YOU COULD SEE HE WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS DRIVEN TO WIN AT ALL COSTS. THAT WAS HIS FOCUS. PETER WAS 10 YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS. HE STARTED VERY SIMILAR TO THE WAY I DID. HE HAD A CORVETTE IN COLLEGE, AND HE USED TO TAKE IT OUT AND RACE IT. THAT'S WHAT HE DID FOR FUN WHEN HE WAS A KID. Hope: HURLEY AND PETER WERE MORE LIKE BROTHERS. IT WASN'T SO MUCH, YOU KNOW, THE MENTOR/PUPIL. THEY RESPECTED EACH OTHER, AND THEY LIKED EACH OTHER. HE WAS A PREPPY RACER. PETER WAS THE NORTHEAST ELITE, AND HURLEY WAS THE MIDWEST ELITE. Patton: WERE BOTH WELL-EDUCATED, BOTH FROM FAMILIES THAT HAD WEALTH. THE FACT THEY WERE BORN ON THE SAME DAY WAS ALWAYS KIND OF STRANGE. BUT THERE WERE SOME SIMILARITIES. I REALLY THINK THAT BOTH PETER AND HURLEY, THEY COMPLEMENTED EACH OTHER. Hurley: IN 1969, I STARTED WITH PETER GREGG, DRIVING A BRUMOS CAR THE SIX HOURS OF WATKINS GLEN. IT'S A WORLD-CHAMPIONSHIP RACE. WE WON THE GT PORTION OF IT. I WAS FEELING REALLY, REALLY GREAT, AND THEN I GOT THAT DREADED LETTER IN THE MAIL FROM THE ARMY. I WAS SHIPPED OFF TO VIETNAM FOR A YEAR. CAME BACK IN THE EARLY PART OF '71 AND IMMEDIATELY STARTED RACING BACK WITH PETER. WE WON TWO IMSA CHAMPIONSHIPS BACK-TO-BACK FROM '71 AND '72. '73, WE WON BACK-TO-BACK DAYTONA AND SEBRING. THOSE ARE TWO BIG, WORLD-RENOWNED RACES. PETER AND I WON AGAIN IN '75, AND SO WHEN PETER AND I WERE TOGETHER, THAT WAS ALMOST AN UNBEATABLE COMBINATION. I WAS JUST THIS KID IN COLLEGE THAT SUDDENLY LANDED INTO ONE OF THE BEST TEAMS IN THE WORLD, AND DRIVING FOR PETER GREGG -- I JUST KIND OF FELL INTO THAT BY -- ALMOST BY MISTAKE. IN THE '70s, IT WAS JUST -- THE WINS JUST WOULDN'T STOP. Davis: THEY WERE QUITE THE TEAM. I CALLED THEM "BATMAN AND ROBIN." IF THEY WERE IN THE RACE, THEY WERE THE GUYS TO BEAT. IN MY WILDEST IMAGINATION, I NEVER DREAMED THAT ALL THE STARS WOULD KIND OF LINE UP AND EVERYTHING WOULD WORK OUT AS IT DID. IT'S AN ICONIC RACE, AND, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY SAYS, "WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LE MANS AND DAYTONA?" I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY MORE DIFFICULT TO WIN HERE AT DAYTONA VERSUS LE MANS. IS IT EASY FOR YOU TO BE HERE AND NOT TO DRIVE? YES AND NO. I'M STILL VERY INVOLVED WITH THE RACING TEAM AND WITH RACING STUFF IN GENERAL. AND MY JOB NOW IS BASICALLY TO HELP WITH RUNNING THE TEAM AND HELP MANAGING THE DRIVERS. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO! Hurley: 27.3. 3, 2, 1, GO! THEY CAN ADJUST THE BELTS AS THEY'RE GOING OUT OF THE PITS. IS THE RULE -- WHAT'S THE RULE SAY? USUALLY THEY CINCH THEM UP AS THEY'RE GOING OUT. - AS THEY'RE GOING OUT? - YEAH. AS LONG -- BUT YOU GOT TO BE SURE THAT THE BELT IS OVER THE HARNESS DEVICE. YEAH, YEAH, SO IT'S ALL CLIPPED IN. - YEAH, YEP. OKAY. - YEAH. Dempsey: ENDURANCE RACING A TEAM SPORT. YOU HAVE THREE DRIVERS, AND EVERYBODY HAS TO RACE, AND EVERYBODY HAS A MINIMUM TIME IN THE CAR, A DRIVE TIME, THAT THEY HAVE TO GO OUT AND DO, SO DRIVERS ROTATE THROUGH. AND YOU DO THIS THROUGH A 24-HOUR CYCLE. 9 TIMES OUT OF 10, THE FASTEST CAR DOESN'T WIN. IT'S THE ONE WITH THE BEST RACE PLAN AND EXECUTES IT AND DOESN'T GET CAUGHT UP IN SOMEONE ELSE'S TROUBLE. OVERCOMING ADVERSITY AND ADJUSTING TO THE SITUATION IS WHAT MARKS A GREAT ENDURANCE TEAM. Hurley: ONE OF THE LESSONS THAT PETER GAVE ME, WHICH I STILL USE TODAY, IS BE PATIENT IN A CAR. YOU HAVE 24 HOURS THAT YOU'VE GOT TO GET THROUGH, SO YOU HAVE TO PACE YOURSELF. PETER WAS KIND OF MY MENTOR. HE WAS THE ONE THAT SET DOWN THE PRINCIPLES, AND I REALLY OBEYED THOSE TO THE LETTER. ONE, I THINK HE SAW SOMEBODY THAT HE COULD GET ALONG WITH. PETER WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE A FRIEND TO. PETER SIMPLY NEEDED TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION AT ALL TIMES AND COULDN'T DEAL WITH ANY OTHER POSITION ON THE TEAM. TO BE A FRIEND TO PETER, YOU HAD TO TAKE THE GOOD AND BAD. YOU HAD TO TAKE HIS REALLY UP MOMENTS, AND THEN YOU HAD TO TAKE HIS REALLY DOWN MOMENTS. AND YOU COULDN'T LET THE DOWN MOMENTS AFFECT THE FRIENDSHIP, 'CAUSE IF YOU DID, THEN YOUR FRIENDSHIP WASN'T GONNA LAST FOR VERY LONG. Stella: HIS IMAGE OF HIMSELF SEEMED TO CHANGE A LOT. YOU KNOW, WHETHER HE WAS A GREAT MANAGER OR GREAT RACER, OR WHATEVER IT WAS, IT WAS HARD TO SAY. Hurley: PETER OWNED MULTIPLE DEALERSHIPS. SO, I MEAN, HE HAD THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. BUT HE WANTED TO BE KNOWN AS PETER GREGG, THE RACING DRIVER. HE WAS THE KIND OF PERSONALITY THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF, EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T LIKE HIM, WHICH WAS OFTEN THE CASE. PETER ALWAYS HAD A WAY OF PUTTING YOU ILL AT EASE, MAKING YOU NERVOUS. PEOPLE WERE VERY NERVOUS AROUND PETER. Hurley: PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE HIS ARROGANCE, AND HE WAS REALLY ARROGANT. HOW DO YOU FEEL THIS CAR WILL DO OUT ON THE TRACK MECHANICALLY? WALT, I WOULDN'T HAVE SIGNED WITH THEM IF I DIDN'T THINK WE'D WIN. AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PEOPLE THAT HE LIKED, HE WAS THE GREATEST GUY IN THE WORLD. HE WAS ALSO LOVABLE OR HATEABLE, DEPENDING ON, YOU KNOW, WHAT MOOD HE WAS IN. JUST WOULD HAVE TO SAY, "OKAY, YOU KNOW, THIS WILL PASS." Stella: IT JUST CAME AND WENT, YOU KNOW, AND YOU DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IT WAS JUST SO OBVIOUS AND STRAIGHTFORWARD, MAYBE TO EVERYBODY BUT HIMSELF. NOBODY KNEW WHAT WAS EXACTLY WRONG WITH HIM. Dempsey: WHEN YOU RACE, IT BECOMES YOUR IDENTITY. YOU SEE EVERY SIDE OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S PERSONALITY. THE TOP DRIVERS -- THEY LIVE AND BREATHE AND DREAM RACING. HURLEY HAYWOOD IS ONE OF THE LEGENDS OF THIS SPORT. SO, IT GAVE HIM HIS IDENTITY, IN A WAY, THAT HE COULDN'T HAVE OFF THE TRACK, WHICH IS HIS GIFT, AND ALSO A BIT OF A CURSE, TOO, I THINK, AT THE SAME TIME. BUT YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM YOURSELF IN THE CAR. DID I FEEL I WAS DIFFERENT? NOT REALLY. I MEAN, I DIDN'T REALLY THINK I WAS DIFFERENT THAN ANYBODY ELSE. I HAD GIRLFRIENDS, AND I HAD ALL THE THINGS YOU NORMALLY DO. BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST MAYBE A LITTLE BIT... OFF-CENTER, AND THAT I DIDN'T REALLY... WELL, I ACTUALLY -- UNTIL RIGHT NOW -- I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY CAME OUT PUBLICLY. MY UPBRINGING DIDN'T APPROVE THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR. MY STEPFATHER WAS REALLY PRETTY NASTY ABOUT THE WHOLE THING, AND BECAUSE HE WAS NASTY, MY MOTHER WAS NOT 100% SUPPORTIVE. I MEAN, MY PARENTS WERE SORT OF THE TYPICAL '50s-TYPE PARENTS. MOST PEOPLE JUST HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WAS GAY. MY PROFESSION THAT I CHOOSE TO MAKE A LIVING AT WAS REALLY SORT OF CONTRADICTORY TO THAT IMAGE OF A GAY PERSON. AND HURLEY WAS QUINTESSENTIAL PERFECT RACE-CAR DRIVER TO EVERYBODY'S EYES. I THOUGHT HURLEY HAYWOOD WAS A MOVIE STAR THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM. HE WAS SO GOOD-LOOKING THAT, YOU KNOW, I JUST ASSUMED. HE WAS HURLEY. IT WAS LIKE CHASING NEWMAN AROUND THE PITS. DID HURLEY HAVE GIRLS AFTER HIM? YOU CAN'T ASK ME THAT. Hope: HE KEPT HIS RACING LIFE AND HIS PERSONAL LIFE SEPARATE, AND ONLY DID EXTREMELY CLOSE FRIENDS KNOW. I'M CONCENTRATING REAL HARD ON DRIVING REAL SMOOTH, AND AS TIME GOES ON, I WANT TO GO A LITTLE BIT DEEPER AND A LITTLE BIT FASTER, HOPEFULLY. YEAH, YEAH. THAT DIDN'T WORK. THAT WAS, UM... EVERYBODY'S NOT TOTALLY COMFORTABLE WITH IT. THAT BEING THE CASE, YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE THAT'S GONNA HAVE ANY TENSION IN IT. YOU DON'T MIX BUSINESS AND PLEASURE. AND I WAS SORT OF INDISCREETLY TOLD THAT BY A VERY GOOD FRIEND, AND HE SAID, "LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF ADVICE. I WOULDN'T BRING YOUR PERSONAL LIFE TO THE RACETRACK." Snodgrass: I CAN'T IMAGINE HAVING TO THINK YOU HAVE TO KEEP PART OF YOUR LIFE QUIET. I THINK THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT, TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT. Hurley: THE WHOLE SOCIAL CIRCLE THAT I RAN IN, AND CERTAINLY THE PROFESSION THAT I CHOSE TO MAKE A LIVING AT, I FELT WAS REALLY GONNA BE A PROBLEM. IT WAS JUST... IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU JUST KNEW. I WASN'T TRYING TO HIDE IT FROM HIM. HE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON. AND I THINK THAT HE WAS SORT OF CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT ALL OF THAT WAS. WHEN I FIRST STARTED RACING WITH PETER, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS ALL KINDS OF RUMORS FLYING AROUND WHEN, YOU KNOW, WE WERE BATMAN AND ROBIN. Dempsey: THIS SPORT IS INCREDIBLY UGLY WHEN IT COMES TO GOSSIP, ESPECIALLY IN THE ERA HE WAS RACING. IT WAS A MACHO WORLD. IT WAS CRAZY WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE '70s WITH THE HYPOCRISY AND THE JUDGMENT AND THE LACK OF TOLERANCE. SOMEBODY SAID TO ME, "I THINK PETER GREGG IS A LATENT HOMOSEXUAL, AND I THINK HE'S GOT EYES FOR HURLEY." I BLEW IT OFF, LIKE, "YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME. GET OUT OF HERE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" AND I WAS OFFENDED. Dempsey: THERE WERE DEFINITELY RUMORS ABOUT GREGG AND HURLEY. I MEAN, THERE WAS ALWAYS RUMORS. Stella: IF THEY HADN'T BEEN SO CLOSE AND SO IN TUNE, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GONE THAT FAST. I MEAN, IT WAS THE VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP IN EVERY WAY. Simon: I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE JUST GOOD FRIENDS. MAYBE ONE PERSON TOLD ME ONCE THAT, LIKE, YOU KNOW, PETER AND HURLEY, LIKE, HAD A RELATIONSHIP. BUT, NO, I NEVER BELIEVED IT. Hope: THEY WERE CLOSE. THEY WERE LIKE BROTHERS. BUT THAT'S NONSENSE. PETER WAS VERY STRAIGHT. MM. NO COMMENT. IF THERE WAS SOMETHING BETWEEN PETER AND HURLEY, IT CERTAINLY WAS THE BEST-KEPT SECRET IN MOTOR RACING. Hurley: BACK IN THE '70s, A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST KIND OF THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, "THE TWO OF THEM ARE HAVING A THING TOGETHER." BUT THAT WAS NEVER THE CASE. IT NEVER WAS BROUGHT UP. IT NEVER WAS DISCUSSED. AND JUST PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, COULD THINK WHAT THEY WANTED TO THINK. Dempsey: YOU KNOW, IT'S TRICKY. IF HURLEY CAME OUT IN THE 1970s, SAYING, "I'M A GAY RACE-CAR DRIVER," HIS CAREER WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER. THOSE WERE THE '70s, SO THESE GUYS WERE TOROS. THESE GUYS WERE COWBOYS. YOU KNOW, I THINK THEY HAD COMPETITION IN THEIR BLOOD. Hewitt: THE GUYS WERE ON TOP. IT WAS A SEXIST SOCIETY. WOMEN GOT SEXUALLY HARASSED IN THOSE DAYS. YOU DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT. Dempsey: WELL, EVERY POSTER THEY'RE SELLING SEX, RIGHT? SEX AND SPEED. AND HE WAS ALWAYS THERE -- HANDSOME RACE-CAR DRIVER, BEAUTIFUL MODEL, TROPHY IN HAND, STANDING ON THE PODIUM, SEXY CAR IN THE BACKGROUND. Snodgrass: THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. IT WAS A TOTAL STEREOTYPE OF WHAT A RACE-CAR DRIVER SHOULD BE. THOSE DAYS ARE PROBABLY NUMBERED. Hurley: AS MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE TO FEEL THAT, YEAH, IT'S OKAY TO BE GAY, IN A LOT OF PLACES, IT'S NOT OKAY TO BE GAY. THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT SCARY IN THE BEGINNING. Hurley: BUT YOU GET USED TO IT, YOU KNOW? AND YOU ADAPT TO IT, AND IT'S PART OF THE JOB. CAN WE PLEASE GET A COUPLE AUTOGRAPHS? - SURE. - YOU'RE, LIKE, WORLD-FAMOUS. WELL... Hurley: I WAS IN A SPORT THAT WAS PREDOMINANTLY MALE, PREDOMINANTLY MACHO. BEING GAY WAS NOT AS ACCEPTED AS IT IS TODAY, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE ANYBODY UNCOMFORTABLE. WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING PRETTY DEFINITE LIKE THAT, I'D HAVE TO SAY PROBABLY, BUT I COULD NOT TELL YOU ANYTHING LIKE THAT. Hurley: I WAS SPONSORED BY PENTHOUSE MAGAZINE, AND THEY HAD SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFULLY GLAMOROUS WOMEN IN THE WHOLE WORLD. IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY IN A WAY, BUT IT -- YOU KNOW, IT WAS BUSINESS. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A CERTAIN FLASH TO RACING. I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, A LOT OF THEM ARE SELLING A PRODUCT. Hurley: YEAH, IT LOOKS GOOD. THERE'S GONNA BE MORE OF THESE, RIGHT? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HURLEY HAYWOOD. Dempsey: HE WAS MARKETABLE. HE'S EVERYTHING YOU WOULD WANT AS A BRAND WANTING TO MARKET YOUR PRODUCT, AND HE DID IT. HE HAD TO DO WHAT HE HAD TO DO IN ORDER TO SURVIVE THE SPORT AT THAT TIME. Hurley: IT WAS REALLY SEXY TO BE A RACING DRIVER, AND IT WAS SEXY TO HAVE A FEMALE ON YOUR ARM, AND, YOU KNOW, I CERTAINLY DID AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE DID TO SORT OF PROMOTE THAT IMAGE. GIRLS LOVED HURLEY. I MEAN, HOW COULD YOU NOT? THEY THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE KIND HAVE BEEN AN AMERICAN JAMES HUNT THE WAY HE LIVED. MY NAME'S HURLEY HAYWOOD. WE'RE AT SAVANNAH'S ROEBLING ROAD. COME ON WITH ME, AND LET'S GO FOR A RIDE. YOU GO TO A RACE WITH HURLEY, PEOPLE ARE ALL OVER HIM. Hurley: THE AUDIENCE THAT YOU'RE PERFORMING FOR, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A GOOD FEELING FOR THAT AUDIENCE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO AND NOT DO. AND THERE'S NOT MANY RACING DRIVERS THAT HAVE COME OUT AND SAID THAT THEY'RE GAY. I WAS MINDFUL NOT ONLY THE SPONSORS BUT MY TEAMMATES, CREW MATES, TEAM OWNERS. THEY WERE PAYING FOR MY RIDE, AND SO I JUST CHOSE TO KEEP IT KIND OF A SECRET. IF YOU'RE A FAN OF SOMEONE, YOU WANT TO KNOW, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S THEIR PERSONAL LIFE LIKE? DO THEY HAVE A FAMILY? WHO ARE THEY WITH? THAT TYPE OF THING. YOUR SUCCESS IS BASED, A LOT OF TIMES, BY YOUR PARTNER IN LIFE. BEHIND EVERY GREAT PERSON, THERE'S A PERSON THAT STANDS BEHIND HIM OR HER THAT HELPS MOTIVATE AND HELPS SUPPORT. I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO LIE ABOUT IT ANYMORE. "TRACKSIDE" ALWAYS LIKES TO FEATURE OUTSTANDING ROOKIES. THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE, HURLEY HAYWOOD. HURLEY, HOW OLD? I AM 31. AND UNMARRIED? UNMARRIED. OKAY, NOW, HURLEY, YOU'RE STAYING INDIANAPOLIS MOTOR SPEEDWAY MOTEL, INCIDENTALLY. THAT'S RIGHT. OKAY. KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU. NOW, I KNOW THAT YOU... Hurley: PETER WAS MARRIED. I THINK HE LIKED THE FAMILY. HE LIKED THE SECURITY THAT A FAMILY GAVE AND HAVING A REALLY STABLE STRUCTURE AT HOME. MY MOM AND DAD MET, LIKE, IN BOSTON. THEY WERE BOTH GOING TO COLLEGE THERE, AND IT WAS A MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN, I GUESS. Hurley: WHEN HE WAS MARRIED TO JENNIFER, I WAS OVER THERE ALL THE TIME. WE WENT ON HOLIDAYS TOGETHER, AND IT WAS -- IT WAS A NICE FRIENDSHIP. Hope: ALL OF THE DRIVERS USUALLY BROUGHT THEIR WIVES AND FAMILIES, AND THEY WERE VERY MUCH A PART OF IT. IT WAS A VERY FAMILY-ORIENTED TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT. Patton: TO ME, JENNIFER WAS A LITTLE BIT OPPOSITE OF PETER -- A LOVING, VERY CARING PERSON. SHE HAD NO QUALMS AT ALL ABOUT HAVING A BEER WITH THE MECHANICS. PETER WAS MADLY IN LOVE WITH JENNIFER. HE LOVED HER FOR LIFE AND WOULD NEVER HAVE EVER LEFT HER. HE WOULD HAVE DRIVEN HER OFF. DAD HAD TO RACE. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT ANYTHING. HE WAS JUST DRIVEN AND SMART, AND HAVING A GREAT PERSON LIKE MY MOM AS HIS PARTNER, YOU KNOW, HELPED HIM SUCCEED, TOO. COULD HAVE ANYBODY EVER STAYED MARRIED TO PETER GREGG? PROBABLY NOT. Hurley: BACK IN THE '70s AND '80s, I MEAN, YOU WERE SO FOCUSED ON RACING THAT YOU REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR A PERSONAL LIFE. HAVING RELATIONSHIPS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT TO DO, AND THAT REALLY TOOK A TOLL. AS A RACING DRIVER, YOU NEED SORT OF YOUR INNER CORE TO BE SUPPORTIVE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT YOU WORK THROUGH. AS A DRIVER, YOU'RE ALWAYS QUESTIONING YOURSELF, YOUR ABILITY -- YOU KNOW, IT'S ON AND ON. THE FIRST TIME I MET MY PARTNER, STEVE, I WAS COMING BACK TO JACKSONVILLE FROM CHRISTMAS VACATION IN CHICAGO. HAD GONE OUT TO A LOCAL BAR IN JACKSONVILLE, AND THAT'S WHERE I MET HIM, AND THAT WAS 19...79. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE WANTS ME TO TALK. CAN YOU SEE WHEN I BLUSH? - NO. - OKAY. HE KEPT FOLLOWING ME AROUND TILL I FINALLY STARTED DANCING WITH HIM AND TALKING WITH HIM. AND, YOU KNOW, I ASSUME I WAS KIND OF NERVOUS TO KIND OF GO INTO A GAY BAR IN DOWNTOWN JACKSONVILLE, WHICH WAS, LIKE, A REALLY SCARY PLACE TO BE, IT WAS, YOU KNOW, KIND OF IN A VERY, YOU KNOW, BAD NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE EVERYTHING WAS SHUT DOWN, AND IT WAS THE ONLY THING AROUND, SO I WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE NERVOUS. I ASKED HIM WHAT HE DID, AND HE SAID HE RACED CARS. HE WAS PROBABLY, I BET, AT THE PEAK OF HIS CAREER, AND I WAS SOMEONE THAT CAME IN AND DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE AND DIDN'T KNOW WHO HE WAS. Hurley: YOU KNOW, THE RACING THING WAS, LIKE, ON A DIFFERENT PLANET. BUT HE WAS PERSISTENT. NO. I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW. I MEAN, IT WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WAS LIKE MAGIC RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. Hill: I THOUGHT HE WAS A BIT OF A SNOB, MAYBE BECAUSE OF WHO HE WAS, ONCE I FIGURED OUT WHO HE WAS. BUT HE ACTUALLY IS JUST -- HE'S REALLY SHY. Hurley: THE ATTRACTION PART, I THINK, CAME WITH TIME, AS HE AND I SORT OF GREW TOGETHER. STEVE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A REALLY SUPPORTIVE PERSON FOR ME FROM A PERSONAL STANDPOINT. HE'S KIND OF THE RUDDER THAT KEEPS THE BOAT GOING DOWN A STRAIGHT LINE. WE DON'T TALK A LOT ABOUT WHAT WE DO WHEN WE'RE HOME, WHICH I WOULD IMAGINE MOST COUPLES DON'T. I WAS NOT INTERESTED IN RACING. EVEN TODAY, I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST IN THAT. YOU KIND OF LEAVE YOUR WORK AT WORK. YOU DON'T BRING IT HOME. I ALWAYS, AND I STILL DO TODAY, STAY IN THE BACKGROUND, YOU KNOW, KIND OF IN THE SHADOWS. I NEVER WANT TO BE IN THE LIMELIGHT. SO AS I WORKED THROUGH THE YEAR, I SAW THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN. O'Meara: HE WAS NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED AS BEING HURLEY'S PARTNER FOR YEARS, AND I THINK IT IS A TRAGEDY. NOW DOMINATING THE FIELD, GT CHAMPION PETER GREGG AT THE WHEEL, ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING RACERS IN THE COUNTRY. Busby: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET INTO RACING AND YOU BEGIN WINNING -- YOU'RE PRETTY SELF-CENTERED. AND YOU GET TO THAT RACETRACK, AND ANYBODY'S TROUBLES OR STUFF, THAT'S IN THE WAY. PETER WAS PERHAPS INCAPABLE OF SACRIFICING HIMSELF COMPLETELY TO ANYBODY. Hurley: HE WAS A LADIES' MAN. HE HAD THE LINE OF GIRLFRIENDS THAT HE DATED, AND THAT WAS THE REASON WHY, YOU KNOW, HE GOT IN TROUBLE WITH HIS FIRST WIFE. DAD MAY HAVE BEEN A PLAYER. IF THEY HAD INFIDELITY PROBLEMS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT IT, LIKE, AND I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T REALLY ASK ABOUT IT. I NEVER REALLY, LIKE, THOUGHT THEY HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS. PETER WAS VERY FLIRTATIOUS. HE ASKED ME OUT A MILLION TIMES OVER THE YEARS AND WAS ALWAYS COMING ON STRONG. Patton: OCCASIONALLY, PETER WOULD HAVE OTHER PEOPLE, OTHER THAN JENNIFER, ATTEND RACES WITH HIM, AND WE ALL KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE, TOO. THEIR RELATIONSHIP FELL APART REALLY FAIRLY SHORTLY THEREAFTER. Hurley: THE DIVORCE THAT PETER HAD WITH JENNIFER WAS NOT ONE THAT WAS PLEASANT. IT WAS JUST A TOUGH PERIOD. AND I WAS SORT OF THE MIDDLE AND SAW BOTH GOOD AND THE BAD. I KIND OF SIDED UP ON JENNIFER'S SIDE OF THE STORY, AND HE KIND OF WENT OFF ON HIS OWN. '75 WAS REALLY KIND OF THE LAST YEAR THAT I WAS RUNNING EXCLUSIVELY WITH PETER. YOU KNOW, I'D GOTTEN ON THE RADAR WITH OTHER TEAMS, AND THEY WERE ALL FINE FOR ME TO DRIVE FOR THEM, SO HE AND I REMAINED FRIENDS, BUT CERTAINLY NOT AS CLOSE AS WE WERE BEFORE THAT. RACING IS VERY HARD ON FAMILIES, AND FROM THAT STANDPOINT, IT WAS PROBABLY LUCKY THAT I DIDN'T HAVE A FAMILY BECAUSE THAT MIGHT HAVE, YOU KNOW, HAD A DIFFERENT OUTCOME. I THINK FOR HURLEY, DRIVING WAS A RELIEF OF SORTS. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH PETER, FOR ONE THING. Hurley: IT'S A VERY VIOLENT SPORT, BUT IT'S ALSO A VERY GENTLE SPORT. YOU'VE GOT THIS LITTLE COCOON THAT YOU'RE OPERATING IN. ALL OF THE OUTSIDE DISTRACTIONS ARE GONE, SO IT'S JUST A NICE FEELING. YOU HAVE ALL THIS HORSEPOWER. YOU HAVE ALL THIS ENERGY THAT THE DRIVER'S TRYING TO HARNESS AND CONTROL AS YOU'RE UP AGAINST NOT ONLY DRIVING A REALLY SERIOUS RACE CAR, BUT IT'S A FRAGILE CAR BUILT TO GO FASTER, NOT BUILT TO CRASH. HURLEY HAYWOOD IS OFF THE COURSE. IT IS DISASTER FOR THE VETERAN AMERICAN. THE CAR'S WHEEL AND SUSPENSION LAY IN THE ROAD, AND THE CROWD WATCHES, HORRIFIED, AS HAYWOOD STRUGGLES TO LEAVE HIS CAR. Hurley: I HAD A CATASTROPHIC INJURY. MY LEG WAS IN A CAST FOR TWO YEARS. TODAY, EVERY STEP I TAKE, I REMEMBER, YOU KNOW, THAT ACCIDENT THAT I HAD WITH MY LEG. Posey: IT WAS A TERRIBLE TIME. WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON IT, IT WAS THE APOGEE OF DANGER IN RACING, YOU KNOW? PEOPLE WERE BEING KILLED RIGHT AND LEFT. WE ALL KNOW THE RISKS THAT ARE INVOLVED, AND WE ALL ACCEPT THOSE RISKS, AND WHEN SOMEBODY IS BADLY HURT OR KILLED, THEN IT'S SORT OF THE COMFORT IN KNOWING THAT THEY KNEW THOSE RISKS AND THEY WERE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY LOVE DOING IT. BACK THEN, THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS IN THE RACE CARS WERE PRETTY MINIMAL. WE ALL WORE OPEN-FACED HELMETS. THE SEAT BELTS WERE KIND OF ARCHAIC. IF YOU LOOK AT A PETER GREGG CAR, YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW SHARP EDGES 'CAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANY SHARP EDGE IMPALE HIM. HE WAS OBSESSED WITH DOING EVERYTHING TO MAKE THE CARS AS SAFE TO DRIVE AS POSSIBLE. THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE SOLD ME THE 917/10. HE SAID IT JUST SCARED HIM TO DRIVE THAT CAR. I WENT FROM A 300-HORSEPOWER 911 TO A 1,200-HORSEPOWER PROTOTYPE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT CAR WITH THE SKIN OFF, I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY ALARMING. IF YOU EVER HAD AN IMPACT AT ANY FORCE, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN CRUMBLED UP LIKE A SARDINE. AND PETER DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE PROTOTYPE RACING, AND THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE SCHEME OF RACING WAS FOLDING OVER TO BE. SO HURLEY WAS MORE FEARLESS, IT SEEMED. Hurley: I WAS JUST PLAIN YOUNG AND STUPID AT THAT POINT. ONCE YOU STRAP YOUR HELMET ON AND YOU START THE CAR, ALL OF THAT GOES OUT THE WINDOW. LE MANS IN FRANCE -- THE TALKS OF THE CAR-RACING CALENDAR. DRIVERS HAVE COME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO TAKE PART. NIGHT OR DAY IN THIS 24-HOUR TEST OF ENDURANCE, THERE'S TENSION ALL THE WAY. Hurley: AT THAT POINT IN '77, I HAD WON THREE RACES AT DAYTONA IN '73, '75, AND '77. BY WINNING THOSE, IT SET MY NAME ON THE INTERNATIONAL BASIS, PORSCHE SAID, "LET'S TAKE A CHANCE. WE WANT TO HAVE AN AMERICAN OVER TO LE MANS TO DRIVE FOR THE FACTORY, BUT WE JUST HAVEN'T FOUND THE RIGHT AMERICAN TO REPRESENT US" AND THEY GAVE ME A SHOT. Leatherman: WHEN YOU LOOK AT SPORTS-CAR RACING, THE WORLD'S VIEW OF IT, THE LE MANS IS THE BIG ONE. Pendell: LE MANS THE CHERRY ON THE CAKE. IT'S THE HOLY GRAIL OF ENDURANCE RACING 'CAUSE THE BUDGETS ARE HUGE. WHEN YOU GET A CALL TO SAY, "OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO LE MANS," IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU'RE DOING. "OKAY, WE'RE GONNA GO LE MANS." YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T WAIT TO GET ON THE PLANE AND GO. Hurley: ONE OF THE REAL BATTLES THAT PETER HAD -- PeG@SuS Urang Sunda Asli WHEN I GOT ASKED TO DRIVE FOR THE FACTORY BEFORE HE DID. THAT WAS A BIG DEAL FOR HIM. Warner: YOU CAN BE A TERRIFIC DRIVER, A GREAT DRIVER. BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T WON LE MANS, NO ONE KNOWS YOU. YOU WIN LE MANS, EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU. Hurley: I KNEW ABOUT LE MANS, BUT I WAS REALLY UNPREPARED FOR THAT WHOLE THING. AND I WAS COMPLETELY LOST. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SPEAK FRENCH, AND I PRACTICALLY HAD A HEART ATTACK JUST THINKING ABOUT STARTING THE MOST IMPORTANT MOTOR RACE IN THE WORLD. Reporter: WELL, IT'S BEEN YOUR FIRST TIME IN LE MANS AND YOUR FIRST TIME IN THIS PORSCHE SPORTS CAR, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE RACE SO FAR? WELL, SO FAR, I'M REALLY HAPPY. IT'S BEEN A TERRIFIC RACE. IT'S BEEN EXCITING. THE CAR IS TERRIFIC. NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS EVER ENVISIONING MYSELF WINNING LE MANS THE VERY FIRST TIME BEING THERE. AFTER WE GOT DOWN OFF OF VICTORY LANE, IT WAS LIKE AN OVERNIGHT ROCK STAR. I MEAN, WHEN I CAME TO THE AIRPORT THE NEXT DAY TO GO HOME ON MONDAY, I WAS, LIKE, MOBBED AT THE AIRPORT. THERE WAS SOME ENVY ON PETER'S PART OVER HURLEY'S SUCCESS. CARS HURLEY WAS DRIVING WERE PROTOTYPES CAPABLE OF WINNING. I DON'T THINK PETER EVER GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE A CAR THAT COULD WIN OVERALL AT LE MANS. Hurley: I THINK THAT PETER WAS VERY PROUD OF WHAT I WAS ABLE TO DO. BUT I THINK THAT HE WAS A LITTLE BIT ENVIOUS OF THAT -- THAT POSITION THAT I WAS IN. PETER NEVER WAS VERY COMFORTABLE DRIVING PROTOTYPES, SO HE WAS FEELING THREATENED. IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT, YOU KNOW, HURLEY COULD RACE ON OTHER TEAMS BESIDES JUST WITH PETER. Patton: ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU'VE GONE FROM AN AUTOCROSSER TO BE WINNING LE MANS OF THAT SHORT OF PERIOD OF TIME. IT SPEAKS JUST UNBELIEVABLY HIGHLY FOR THIS NATURAL SKILL THAT HURLEY HAD. SO HE PROVED THAT HIS SUCCESS WASN'T JUST DUE TO BRUMOS AND PETER GREGG. Hurley: AFTER I HAD WON THE RACE, I WAS AMAZED THAT SO MANY PEOPLE KNEW WHO I WAS. IN THE BEGINNING, I WAS KIND OF EMBARRASSED WITH ALL THE ATTENTION. THE FAME CAME SORT OF BY SURPRISE. YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST -- I'M STILL SURPRISED TODAY. I WAS HERE IN THE GREAT DAYS. WHEN HE'S AT THE TRACK, HE IS IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ELEMENT. CAN I TAKE A PICTURE TAKEN WITH YOU? SURE, YOU CAN. - AWESOME. - THERE YOU GO. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE ABOUT HIM THAN WHEN HE'S OFF THE TRACK. HE'S IN HIS PERSONA. HE'S IN HIS HURLEY HAYWOOD PERSONA, YOU KNOW? SO HE'S GONNA DO HIS JOB. AND HAVE FUN. I WAS WORRIED ABOUT, OH, THEY'RE GONNA, YOU KNOW, KNOW HE'S GAY BECAUSE I'M HERE. SO I WOULD STAY WAY IN THE BACKGROUND UP AGAINST THE FENCE, YOU KNOW. IT'S NOT A COMFORTABLE PLACE TO BE. BUT, I MEAN, THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS. WE HAVE SEEN YOU SO MANY TIMES WITH A VERY SOLEMN EXPRESSION ON YOUR FACE, WALKING DOWN TO THE PIT AREA. I WISH THE FANS COULD SEE IN EAR-TO-EAR GRIN RIGHT NOW. CONGRATULATIONS. WELL, BELIEVE ME, FOR ME, IT'S VERY EXCITING TO BE HERE, AND I AM SO HAPPY THIS IS ALL OVER. I GUESS, YOU KNOW, FROM THE CAREER STANDPOINT, THE MOMENTS WHERE I WAS MOST DISAPPOINTED WERE TIMES WHEN HE WOULD WIN A RACE, AND, YOU KNOW, I KNEW THAT IF I WAS A WOMAN AND HIS WIFE, THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT THERE ON TOP THE CAR WITH EVERYONE ELSE. THOSE KIND OF MOMENTS, YOU KNOW, WE COULDN'T REALLY SHARE TOGETHER, AND THAT BOTHERED ME. I DON'T KNOW IF IT BOTHERED HIM, BUT IT BOTHERED ME. WHEN HE WON THE 24 HOURS OF DAYTONA THE LAST TIME, I HAD A HANDFUL OF MY FRIENDS THERE, AND WE WATCHED VICTORY LANE THROUGH A CHAIN-LINK FENCE. Hurley: THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS AT THAT TIME. NOW, IF I WON DAYTONA NEXT YEAR, WHICH IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN, YOU KNOW, THEN IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT. SO, YES, HE WAS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A LITTLE BIT. IF IT WAS MY GIRLFRIEND, MY GIRLFRIEND WOULD HAVE BEEN UP THERE HUGGING ME AND KISSING ME. BUT IT JUST WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A COMFORTABLE THING FOR HIM OR ME TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN. YOU CAN'T CHANGE THINGS. I WASN'T GONNA, YOU KNOW, TRY TO MAKE A SCENE AND TRY TO EMBARRASS HIM BY FORGING MY WAY IN THERE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW. I WAS JUST CONCERNED THAT I WOULD JUST DRAW ATTENTION TO HIM BEING GAY. Dempsey: SPORTS-CAR RACING, ROAD RACING -- IT TAKES A TOLL, WITHOUT QUESTION. YOU LEAVE A PART OF YOURSELF ON THE TRACK EVERY RACE. AND YOU HAVE TO BE 100% COMMITTED TO WIN, AND YOU DO HAVE TO SACRIFICE TO GET TO THAT LEVEL. WHAT YOU'VE GIVEN UP, IT'S HARD. IT ALIENATES A LOT OF PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY 'CAUSE NOTHING ELSE MATTERS OTHER THAN WHERE YOU ARE AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME. AND SOME PEOPLE UNDERSTAND, AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T. IT FEELS JUST LIKE IT DID IN 1971. ALL RIGHT, YOU READY? Long: I CALL MOTORSPORT A RELIGION, OR AN OBSESSION, AN ILLNESS. IT'S A DRUG THAT -- THE HIGH THAT EVERYBODY WANTS. Busby: IT'S AN EXPERIENCE THAT MOST DON'T HAVE. IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT'S A WINNER IN A RACING CAR, YOU SLIP INTO A STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IS NOT ON THE CONSCIOUS LEVEL. WHEN YOU'RE IN THE CAR, YOU'RE COMPLETELY ABSORBED BY THE TASK OF DRIVING IT. THERE'S NO ROOM THERE FOR EXTRANEOUS THOUGHTS. Leatherman: MONEY PROBLEMS OR RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS, OR ALL THAT STUFF IS GONE. Hurley: RACING IS ALMOST LIKE A SHIELD FROM EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON OUTSIDE OF THE RACETRACK. THERE CAN BE A MILLION THINGS HAPPENING AROUND YOU, BUT YOU JUST SORT OF ZONE IT ALL OUT. AND WHEN IT'S OVER, THE DEMONS ARE BACK. IT IS DAYTONA INTERNATIONAL SPEEDWAY, AND WE'RE INTO QUALIFYING FOR THE UNITED SportsCar CHAMPIONSHIP. WELL, THERE IS THE GREEN FLAG FLYING, GENTLEMEN. Announcer #2: THE PRESSURE'S ON THE DRIVER. THEY HAVE TO DO IT NOW. THEY CAN'T WORK UP TO IT. NOT SURE THAT THAT CAR ACTUALLY TURNED A LAP. YOU HAVE TO GO NOW. Wright: YOU GOT TO GO. IF WE DON'T... I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE... HE WAS DOING. THAT COULD HAVE BEEN UGLY. YOU NEVER SET IN THE PITS. YOU GO RIGHT THEN. - YEAH. - A LESSON FOR THESE GUYS. THEY'RE NOT QUALIFYING THING. THEY GET OUT AND GO. - AND, I MEAN, THAT WAS THE PLAN. - YEAH. AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT THE...?" I THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR. - YEP. - YOU CAN'T BEAT EXPERIENCE. YOU JUST CAN'T. Dempsey: THERE'S A LEVEL OF EXPECTATIONS THAT YOU HAVE THAT YOU HAVE TO PERFORM, AND YOU HAVE TO DO WELL. SO IF YOU MAKE TOO MANY MISTAKES, IT'S OVER. A RACING DRIVER'S GREATEST FEAR IS NOT TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM AT 100%. THE CLOSER YOU ARE TO 100%, THE BETTER THE OUTCOME'S GONNA BE. YEP. YOU'RE JUDGING YOUR PERFORMANCE ON THAT ONE SINGLE DAY AGAINST ALL YOUR COMPETITORS. THE GAUGE FOR A PERFORMANCE IS INSTANT. WHEN YOU FEEL THAT YOU'VE FAILED AT SOMETHING, FAILED IN A RACE BECAUSE YOU MADE MISTAKES, THEN IT'S YOUR FAULT. THE GUY THAT WON MADE LESS MISTAKES THAN I DID, AND A MISTAKE CAN BE JUST TINY, LITTLE THING. Peter: WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF GREAT DRIVES AND A COUPLE OF DISAPPOINTING DEFEATS. SOMEBODY SAID RACING IS ALL A BUNCH OF ECSTASY AND AGONY. THERE'S NOTHING IN BETWEEN. YOU'RE SELDOM JUST MEDIUM HAPPY WITH IT. Hurley: '78 AND '79, PETER WAS REALIZING THAT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE HIS DOMINANT ROLE IN SPORTS-CAR RACING WAS COMING TO AN END. THERE WAS TOO MUCH COMPETITION COMING OVER FROM EUROPE, REALLY FAST GUYS THAT COULD CARE LESS ABOUT PETER GREGG AND WHAT HE STOOD FOR. THEY JUST WANTED TO BEAT HIM ALL THE TIME. IN 1980, HE GOT ASKED TO DRIVE ON THE FACTORY TEAM AT LE MANS. SO I WENT WITH PETER TO LE MANS, AND THAT DIDN'T TURN OUT SO GREAT, EITHER. WE HAD AN ACCIDENT GOING FROM THE HOTEL TO THE TRACK. YOU KNOW, THOSE ROADS IN FRANCE -- THEY'RE NOT VERY WIDE, BUT A LOT OF THEM STRAIGHT. AND A TRACTOR MOVED OUT OF A SIDE ROAD, AND PETER SWERVED TO AVOID HITTING THE TRACTOR. WE WENT OVER. WE TUMBLED OVER AND ENDED UP UPSIDE DOWN. AND PETER WAS OUT. HE GOT HIT IN THE HEAD. WHEN HE WOKE UP AND EVERYTHING, HE WAS IN A COMPLETE STATE OF DENIAL. HE INSISTED ON GOING TO THE TRACK AND EVERYTHING, BUT THE DOCTORS WOULDN'T LET HIM RACE. Hurley: SOMETHING HAPPENED TO PETER'S EYESIGHT. THAT WAS REALLY EMBARRASSING FOR HIM. BECAUSE OF HIS CONCUSSION AND DOUBLE VISION, DAD COULDN'T RACE VERY WELL. Leatherman: YOU COULD TELL HE JUST -- HE WAS JUST NOT HIMSELF. THAT WAS MAJOR TO PETER, NOT BEING ABLE TO BE THE PETER, THE PETER PERFECT THAT HE WAS. HE COULDN'T HANDLE THE LACK OF SUCCESS. Hurley: HE HAD THE ACCIDENT, AND HE WAS "FLUSTRATED" AND EMBARRASSED THAT THAT HAPPENED. SO WHEN THE PAUL REVERE CAME AROUND -- THAT WAS THE RACE AFTER WE GOT BACK FROM LE MANS -- WELL, THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT I RACED FOR PETER. SO, I STARTED THE RACE, HAD A HUGE LEAD, A LAP LEAD, AND I JUST GOT SO HOT, JUST HOTTER THAN HELL, AND I FINALLY CALLED IN. I SAID, "I JUST DON'T THINK I CAN DRIVE ANOTHER LAP. I'M JUST ABOUT READY TO MELT DOWN. IS THERE ANY WAY THAT PETER IS READY TO GO?" HE SAYS, "YEAH, HE'S STANDING HERE WITH HIS HELMET ON." SO I SAID, "OKAY, I'M COMING IN ON THE NEXT LAP." WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE PITS, I GAVE HIM NEARLY A LAP LEAD. HE LOST LEAD, AND WE FINISHED THIRD. SO HE BASICALLY BLAMED ME FOR DOING THAT ON PURPOSE TO MAKE HIM LOOK BAD. IT WAS NOT ON PURPOSE. THAT'S THE SPIN THAT PETER STARTED IN. I MEAN, HE WASN'T THE PETER THAT HE WAS BEFORE, AND SO IT WAS OTHER PEOPLE'S FAULT. Hurley: BASICALLY, HE FORBID ME INTO THE DEALERSHIPS. HE SAID, "DON'T COME AROUND. I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU." HE DIDN'T WANT ME THERE, SO I SAID, "OKAY, THAT'S FINE. I'M NOT GONNA GO THERE." PETER WAS ROUGH ON EVERYBODY. HE WAS ROUGH ON HURLEY. HE WAS ROUGH ON ANYBODY WHO WAS CLOSE TO HIM OR SURROUNDED HIM. Hurley: AS TIME WENT ON AND HE HAD OTHER ISSUES, SOME OF THE, YOU KNOW, CRAZINESS WAS STUFF YOU JUST COULDN'T OVERLOOK ANYMORE. IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY, THIS PROBLEM. Hurley: IN A LOT OF WAYS, IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST PREDICTABLE, BUT WE NEVER -- WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT IT, YOU SAY, YOU KNOW, "WHY DIDN'T WE -- WHY DIDN'T WE SEE THAT COMING?" BASICALLY, I DID NOT SEE OR TALK TO PETER FROM THE MIDDLE OF JULY UNTIL SOMETIME AROUND THE FIRST PART OF DECEMBER. I ALWAYS WAS ABLE TO SORT OF KEEP TOUCH ON WHAT WAS GOING ON, BUT NOT THROUGH PETER, BUT FROM OTHER PEOPLE THAT WERE AROUND HIM. Pendell: DEBORAH GREGG HAD COME INTO HIS LIFE. ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE BECAME VERY VISIBLE AROUND THE DEALERSHIP, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE WAS A WOMAN. Simon: SHE WAS YOUNG AND SEXY. HE WAS, LIKE, TAKEN BY HER CHARMS. THEY DATED FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS BEFORE THEY GOT MARRIED. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY MET, BUT I USED TO HAVE KIND OF A CHIP ON MY SHOULDER ABOUT THAT. I COULD SEE HIM FALLING IN LOVE IN A HURRY LIKE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF PERSONALITY THAT PETER HAD. YOU KNOW, HE WAS EITHER ALL IN OR HE WAS ALL OUT. THERE WAS NO IN BETWEEN WITH HIM. IT WAS CRAZY, RIGHT? SO THAT WASN'T SURPRISING. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISING IF IT WEREN'T CRAZY. SHE WAS A SMART GIRL AND, I MEAN, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE KNEW, EITHER, ABOUT WHAT THE WORLD WAS THAT SHE WAS IN. AND, I MEAN, IF THEY WEREN'T AS WEIRD OF PAIR AS YOU COULD FIND, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. Hurley: THAT WAS HIS QUEST IN LIFE IS TO FIND SOMEBODY THAT WOULD MARRY HIM, AND... THAT LASTED NINE DAYS. FOR ME, THAT MAYBE 15 MINUTES FROM THE COMMAND TO START YOUR ENGINES, I LIKE TO KIND OF JUST SIT THERE AND PLAN THE ATTACK THAT I'M ABOUT READY TO DO. YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO GET EVERYTHING IN YOUR MIND SET TO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO AND WHEN YOU NEED TO DO IT. YOU'RE ALWAYS THINKING, YOU KNOW, "AM I GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE TASK ON THIS GIVEN DAY? AM I GONNA HURT MYSELF? AM I GONNA KILL MYSELF?" I MEAN, IT'S JUST A MILLION THINGS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND. - THANKS FOR BEING HERE. - ALL RIGHT. YEAH. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANKS. YEAH. DRIVERS, PLEASE START YOUR ENGINES. AND HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE THAT SOUND? THE ROLEX 24 STARTS OFF THE SPORTS-CAR CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON IN NORTH AMERICA. IT'S A 200-MILE-AN-HOUR CHESS GAME FOR 24 HOURS, AND IT HAPPENS RAIN OR SHINE. OH, BRAGGING RIGHTS -- IT ALL STARTS RIGHT HERE. THE GREEN FLAG FLIES. Announcer #2: THIS IS OUR SUPER BOWL, AND YOU GUY HAVE A FRONT-ROW SEAT. HE'S NOT DOING BRAKES, OKAY? SO JUST THE WHOLE SERVICE, IN AND OUT. - NO BRAKES? - NO BRAKES. WHAT YOU THINK, CALVIN? GTD -- HOW ARE THEY GONNA DO DURING THE NIGHT? THERE'S SOME SUPERSTARS IN THIS CATEGORY. IT'S GONNA BE A GREAT BATTLE. LITERALLY RIGHT DOWN TO THE WIRE LAST YEAR, BOB. Announcer #3: AS MUCH AS WE'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT BRUMOS CAR IN THE HUNT RIGHT NOW, IT'S DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT. SEE, THOSE CURVES RUNNING AROUND. OOH, THERE'S A TOUCH. I THINK THAT WAS. THAT'S UNNECESSARY. HELL OF A STRAP GOING ON HERE IN GTD. Hurley: I GET A PHONE CALL FROM PETER. THAT KIND OF THREW ME FOR A LOOP. AND I SAID, "OKAY." AND SO, I WENT DOWN THERE, AND DEBORAH HAD FIXED A REALLY NICE LUNCH TO SERVE US. AND WE ATE OUT ON THE TERRACE AND BASICALLY TALKED ABOUT WHEN WE HAD FIRST MET, ALL THE WAY THROUGH ALL THE THINGS WE HAD DONE AND KIND OF WHAT THE FUTURE WAS GONNA HOLD, THINGS WE COULD DO GOING FORWARD. HE HAD ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO GO TO THE BASKETBALL GAME WITH HIM. AND I SAID, "NO, I CAN'T DO IT. I'VE ALREADY GOT SOMETHING PLANNED FOR THIS EVENING." AND, BASICALLY, HE ROLLED UP IN A BLANKET ON THE COUCH AND THE NEXT DAY WENT OUT AND BOUGHT A GUN AND SHOT HIMSELF. YOU KNOW, THAT WAS AN AWFUL DAY. "BANG, BANG, BANG" ON THE DOOR. AND THEY, SAID, "MY GOD. YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED. PETER SHOT HIMSELF, KILLED HIMSELF ON THE BEACH." I COULDN'T FATHOM THAT HE HAD DONE THAT. AND BY THE TIME I WAS ABLE TO DIGEST THAT, ALL THE PRESS HAD ARRIVED OUTSIDE. I IMMEDIATELY GOT ON THE PHONE TO JENNIFER AND TO THE KIDS TO TELL THEM ABOUT IT. I WANTED THEM TO HEAR THAT FROM ME, NOT THE PRESS. AND IT WAS, "PETER'S KILLED HIMSELF." AND, YOU KNOW, A LONG PAUSE AT THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, LOTS OF TEARS. I MEAN, IT WAS JUST AWFUL. THAT DAY WAS A BAD DAY. I'LL NEVER FORGET IT. MY MOM SAID SHE HAD SOME BAD NEWS FOR ME, AND I BETTER SIT DOWN. I REMEMBER NOT BEING ABLE TO FEEL, LIKE, THE IMPACT OF IT HAPPENING RIGHT THEN. I GOT THE PHONE CALL, AND HURLEY TOLD ME WHAT HAD HAPPENED. IT WAS PRETTY SHOCKING. UM...NO. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ONE BIT OF DIFFERENCE. I THINK THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER THINGS GOING ON IN HIS MIND THAT IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ON THAT MONDAY. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN, YOU KNOW, THE NEXT WEEK SOMETHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. PEOPLE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING THROUGH AND HOW TO LOOK FOR SIGNS OF WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN DISTRESS. IF I HAD BEEN TRAINED IN LOOKING AT SIGNS OF PEOPLE THAT WERE GONNA, YOU KNOW, COMMIT SUICIDE, I WOULD HAVE HAD THE RED FLAG IN THE AIR. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE ALWAYS LOOKED AT PETER AS BEING PETER. WE JUST KIND OF DIDN'T SEE IT. THEY ATTRIBUTED IT TO MANIC DEPRESSION AND NOT TAKING HIS MEDICINE, WHICH WAS LITHIUM, FOR THAT. HE FELT, "I'M TOO SMART TO LET MEDICINE DICTATE MY LIFE." SMART PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE COMMON SENSE. "I'M SMARTER THAN THE MEDICINE. I CAN DEAL WITH THIS MYSELF." AND HE COULDN'T. EVERYBODY IN RACING WAS SHOCKED. THEY ALL REALIZED THE SCOPE OF THE LOSS. Chapman: IT JUST HITS YOU FROM THE BROADSIDE. I STILL RIGHT NOW -- I GET CERTAIN CHILLS OVER IT. YOU WASN'T JUST LOSING AN OWNER OR A COMPANY, BUT YOU WERE LOSING A WINNER, A FRIEND. IT WAS SO UNBELIEVABLE. Warner: I CAN REMEMBER MY EXACT RESPONSE. "I'M SHOCKED, BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED." THE GUY HAD ALL THE INGREDIENTS TO HAVE A WONDERFUL LIFE. HE WASN'T HAPPY. France: IT SEEMED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS SO PERFECT FROM THE OUTSIDE, SO WHY WOULD THE GUY THAT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOT EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW, WANT TO ABANDON IT? Busby: THERE WAS SOMETHING DEEPER. PETER BROUGHT WITH HIM SOMETHING FROM HIS -- PERHAPS HIS CHILDHOOD. Simon: YOU KNOW, HIS MOTHER TOOK HER OWN LIFE, TOO, WHEN HE WAS, LIKE, SEVEN YEARS OLD. WHEN PETER WAS BORN, SHE GOT POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION. SHE JUMPED IN FRONT OF THE SUBWAY TRAIN. UNFORTUNATELY, ALL THE PIECES FIT TOGETHER, I MEAN, IT WASN'T LIKE IT WAS ANY INCREDIBLE ANOMALY. Simon: HE HAD THE STOP RACING FOR A WHILE, AND THEN IT WAS HARD TO COME BACK, AS IF HIS SELF-WORTH WAS BASED ONLY ON WINNING RACES. I THINK THAT IT WAS A LOSS OF SELF. I THINK THAT HE, ALL OF A SUDDEN, WASN'T THE WHOLE PETER GREGG THAT HE HAD INVENTED, AND HE COULDN'T FALL BACK AND SAY, "THAT'S WHO I WAS. I'M PROUD OF IT. NOW I'M SOMETHING ELSE." Hurley: PETER WAS "PETER PERFECT." HE WAS KIND OF LIKE MY BROTHER, MY OLDER BROTHER, AND HE WAS SOMEBODY THAT I LOOKED UP TO AND ADMIRED GREATLY. THROUGH EVERYTHING, HURLEY LOVED PETER. HE REALLY DID. THE LOSS OF PETER WAS DEVASTATING TO HURLEY. I THINK IT WAS LIKE HIS LOST A PART OF HIS FAMILY. THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LOVE, BUT I WOULD SAY, YEAH, I LOVED HIM. THE BRUMOS THING WAS PETER GREGG AND HURLEY HAYWOOD AS A TEAM. NOW IT'S -- NOW WHAT IS IT? GREEN FLAG, AND WE'VE GOT THE 12 HOURS OF SEBRING UNDERWAY. Hurley: JUST TWO MONTHS AFTER PETER DIED, I WON MY SECOND SEBRING IN 1981. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD, BUT NOT TO HAVE HIM AROUND WAS KIND OF A REALLY STRANGE THING. Announcer #2: NUMBER 3 COMING UP HARD AND FAST, HURLEY HAYWOOD NOW DRIVING. Hurley: TWO YEARS LATER, I WAS ABLE TO HAVE MY SECOND WIN AT LE MANS IN 1983. IN 1991, I WAS ON TRACK TO WIN MY FIFTH WIN AT DAYTONA. IF I CAN WIN IT TODAY, AND THIS WILL MAKE FIVE WINS AT THIS RACETRACK, AND NOBODY'S EVER DONE THAT. IT WOULD ALSO GIVE ME THE LEAD IN THE ALL-TIME, THE CLASSIC RACES, WHICH IS HERE, DAYTONA, AND LE MANS. DAYTONA HAS BEEN GOOD TO ME OVER THE YEARS, AND IT'S ONLY 70 MILES FROM HOME. I'VE GOT A LOT OF FRIENDS THAT COME DOWN. AND SO PATIENCE PROVED TO BE PRUDENT, AND I'M SITTING IN VICTORY LANE. Hurley: WITHOUT PETER, I PROBABLY NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WIN ALL THE RACES THAT I WON. I GIVE HIM COMPLETE CREDIT FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP THE WAY I DEVELOPED. PETER WAS ALWAYS MY FRIEND. YOU KNOW, THERE WAS GOOD TIMES AND BAD TIMES, BUT HE WAS STILL, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY THAT WAS HUGELY INSTRUMENTAL IN MY ENTIRE CAREER. WITHOUT PETER, NOBODY WOULD KNOW WHO HURLEY HAYWOOD WAS TODAY. I REALLY MEAN THAT, SERIOUSLY. AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR HIM FOR THAT. OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT SEEMS LIKE THE MINUTES ARE RUSHING AWAY AFTER WE WERE COUNTING THE HOURS... ONCE I SORT OF CUED UP THE FACT THAT HE, YOU KNOW, HAD A PARTNER AND HAD A GREAT HOUSE TOGETHER IN JACKSONVILLE, AND THAT THEY HAD BEEN TOGETHER FOR A WHILE, SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING TO ME ABOUT, "WATCH WHICH HAND HIS RING IS ON." I WANTED SOMETHING TO SAY WE WERE COMMITTED, SO I SAID, "WELL, LET'S -- I'LL GET A RING, AND THEN WE'LL BOTH HAVE A RING." AND IT REALLY NEVER OCCURRED TO ME, BUT THAT IT WOULD -- IT WOULD SWITCH. HE WOULD SWITCH IT WHEN HE WAS SORT OF AT A MORE FORMAL DRIVING-TYPE EVENT, AND WHEN IT WAS MORE OF A CASUAL, YOU KNOW, DINNER OUT. AT THAT TIME, WE BOTH WORE THEM ON OUR RIGHT HAND, AND, ACTUALLY, THIS IS FIT MY RIGHT HAND. IT FALLS OFF MY LEFT HAND. WE WERE AT A WEDDING ONE TIME, AND HURLEY WAS GOING TO DO A TOAST. HE DID THE TOAST. AND I REMEMBER THERE WERE TWO MEN IN THE CROWD, AND ONE OF THEM SAID SOMETHING LIKE, "WHAT DOES HE KNOW ABOUT MARRIAGE?" I THINK IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT HIS INFERENCE WAS THAT BECAUSE HURLEY WAS GAY, THAT HE COULD NOT SPEAK FROM ANY AUTHORITY ABOUT LOVE OR MARRIAGE. AND I REALLY WANTED TO SAY TO THE GUY, "HE KNOWS A LOT MORE ABOUT LOVE THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW." IN MY MIND, THEY WERE ALREADY MARRIED. BUT I KNOW IT WAS IMPORTANT TO THEM TO BE ABLE TO LEGALLY WED. Hurley: WHETHER YOU'RE MARRIED, WHETHER YOU'RE SINGLE, EVERY RACING DRIVER SACRIFICES IN SOME ELEMENT OF THEIR LIFE. I LOVE BEING HOME, AND THAT'S WHERE STEVE IS. WHEN YOU LEAVE THAT ENVIRONMENT, YOU'RE SACRIFICING. YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE THERE. AND I'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR, YOU KNOW, GOD KNOWS HOW LONG. BUT RACING, FOR ME, IS LIKE A LOVE STORY. I MEAN, IT'S JUST -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A REALLY GREAT CAR AND A GREAT TEAM BEHIND YOU AND GREAT DRIVERS THAT YOU'RE DRIVING WITH, IT'S AN HONOR. TWO AND A HALF MINUTES TO GO... OH, MY. ONE MORE LAP. AFTER 23 HOURS AND 59 MINUTES, IT'S JUST ONE MORE LAP. IT'S JUST SO GREAT TO BE HERE, TO BE A PART OF THIS SPORT, AND HERE WITH BRUMOS AND WITH PORSCHE AND THEIR SUPPORT. AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PORSCHE, YOU TALK ABOUT HURLEY HAYWOOD, TOO. AND HIS ADVICE HAS REALLY HELPED US SURVIVE THIS. BOB WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD. I'M GLAD IT'S OVER. THAT WAS TOO MUCH STRESS FOR NOT BEING IN THE CAR, I'LL TELL YOU THAT. HURLEY'S LEGACY IS HIS UNDERSTATED SUCCESS. Posey: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A GUY WHO'S MADE HIS MARK IN ABOUT THE QUIETEST WAY YOU CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE. Dempsey: IN EVERY GENERATION, THERE'S ONE ATHLETE WHO JUST SURPASSES EVERYBODY ELSE, AND HURLEY WAS THAT DRIVER OF THAT ERA. THAT'S NO JUDGMENT THERE BECAUSE IT'S PROVEN. AND I THINK HE FOUND A SPORT THAT WAS JUST LIKE QUINTESSENTIAL MALE MACHISMO, AND HE PROVED THAT ALL WRONG. Long: HURLEY HAYWOOD IS ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD NAMES IN SPORTS-CAR RACING WORLDWIDE, BUT ESPECIALLY FOR AN AMERICAN, HE'S A LEGEND IN MY EYES, AND TO EVEN HAVE HIM RECOGNIZE ME OR CALL ME BY MY FIRST NAME, AS A KID, YOU JUST SEE THESE GUYS ON TV, BUT TODAY, HE'S SOMEONE I GO TO ADVICE. Dempsey: NOW HE'S A MENTOR TO PEOPLE. HE'S A GOOD COACH, AND HE'S AN AMBASSADOR OF THE SPORT. ARE YOU READY? GO. THE CREAM RISES TO THE TOP, AND HURLEY ROSE TO THE TOP. ANYONE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT KNOWS US KNOWS WE'RE A COUPLE AND HAVE BEEN FOR, YOU KNOW, NOW 25 YEARS. BUT IT IS HARD TO SAY TODAY, YOU KNOW, THAT HURLEY IS MY HUSBAND. I CAN'T SAY THAT TODAY AT WORK, EVEN THOUGH I'M IN A VERY OPENLY SUPPORTIVE ORGANIZATION FOR GLBTQ. I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE BECAUSE I KIND OF WORRY ABOUT HIS FANS AND, YOU KNOW, HIS LEGACY, AND HOW IT MAY BE REPRESENTED. I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS. WELL, HERE I AM. OH, MY GOD. CAN YOU SIGN IT? - SURE. - OH, MY GOD. TO ANYBODY SPECIAL OR JUST MY NAME? OH, TO DANNY. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. MY HUSBAND ADORES YOU. HIS CAR IS THE SAME COLOR SCHEME AS YOURS. - REALLY? - OH, MY GOD. IF HE COMES OUT AND HE'S MILITANT, I THINK IT KILLS HIM. IF HE COMES OUT AND HE'S GRACEFUL AND HE'S HURLEY AND SAYS, "THIS IS MY LIFE. THIS IS THE SECRET THAT I'VE LIVED. I DON'T WANT TO WEAR IT AS A BADGE OF HONOR, AND I'M NOT GONNA WEAR A SCARLET RIBBON." BUT IF HE COMES OUT AND HE'S A MILITANT GAY ACTIVIST, I THINK IT HURTS HIM. Long: HIS SEXUALITY OR HIS PRIVATE LIFE IS NOT THE FIRST THING THAT COMES UP. THERE'S NOT MANY QUESTIONS FOR ME BECAUSE IT DOESN'T CHANGE MUCH. IT REALLY DOESN'T. THE TIMES HAVE CHANGED. WHY KEEP IT HIDDEN. WHO CARES? I WOULD HOPE THAT HURLEY'S COMING OUT WOULD ADD TO HIS LEGACY. I GUESS I DON'T WANT TO SEE HURLEY'S INCREDIBLE SUCCESS IN HIS INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY AND KNOWN THE WORLD OVER, FROM CORPORATE BOARD ROOMS TO RACE-FAN KIDS -- I DON'T WANT HIM TO BECOME MORE FAMOUS BECAUSE HE'S GAY. I WOULD NOT GET ON A SOAPBOX. Dempsey: I THINK IT'S EVEN TOUGH NOW TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY IN MOTORSPORT. AND THIS IS A SPORT I LOVE. I'M NOT SURE TIMES HAVE CHANGED THAT MUCH. IT TAKES ONE PERSON TO SORT OF STAND UP AND GO AGAINST THE GROUP AND STAND AS AN INDIVIDUAL. IT TAKES GREAT COURAGE. Hurley: PEOPLE WILL SAY, "WELL, WHY, AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME, DO YOU FEEL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO COME OUT TO YOUR PUBLIC?" PETER'S LOSS WAS A HUGE EMOTIONAL BLOW TO ME. HE COMMITTED SUICIDE, AND HE COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED BY... TALKING... IF WE HAD THE RIGHT TOOLS TO LISTEN. I WAS IN MY OFFICE, AND THE TELEPHONE RANG, AND IT WAS A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR. HE WAS GAY, AND HE STARTS ON THIS STORY LINE OF HIM BEING BULLIED ALL OF HIS LIFE, AND EVERY MORNING HE WAKES UP AND HE THINKS, YOU KNOW, "I'M GONNA COMMIT SUICIDE." AND I SAID, "LISTEN... ...IT'S NOT HARD TO LOOK AT YOU AND SEE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM. TURN THAT AROUND AND MAKE THAT A POSITIVE THING FOR YOU. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD WHO ARE GAY THAT ARE IN EVERY KIND OF PROFESSION THAT YOU CAN THINK OF. I'M AT THE HEIGHT OF MY PROFESSION RIGHT NOW, AND I'M GAY, SO YOU CAN DO ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO DO IF YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO IT." ABOUT A YEAR LATER, HIS MOTHER CALLED, AND SHE SAID, "YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO I AM, BUT YOU TALKED TO MY SON ABOUT A YEAR AGO. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU PROBABLY SAVED HIS LIFE." AND THAT'S A REALLY HEAVY THING TO HEAR FROM A MOTHER. YOU KNOW, THAT WAS -- MM. I GET CHOKED UP WHEN I EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT. IT HAS TO DO WITH GIVING A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TO SOMEBODY THAT MIGHT BE YOUNG THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE THINGS THAT I WENT THROUGH WHEN I WAS YOUNG. I'M LUCKY I'M STILL HERE. WHERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENT IN THE PAST, I NOW SAY, "OKAY, IT'S TIME TO BE VOCAL ABOUT IT, AND IT'S TIME TO GIVE BACK." IT ISN'T ALWAYS ABOUT WINNING THE RACE. SOMETIMES IT'S ABOUT HAVING HAPPINESS IN YOUR LIFE AND BEING ABLE TO BE TRUE TO YOURSELF. WHEN NEW YORK PASSED THE LAW FOR GAY MARRIAGE, AND IT WAS OPEN TO ANYONE... Hurley: WE SAID, "OKAY, YOU KNOW, LET'S DO IT." Hill: ON A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY IN THE MIDDLE OF CENTRAL PARK... IT WAS A PERFECT DAY. O'Meara: I THINK WE ALL FELT VERY TOUCHED. IT WAS A BIG STEP FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO LEGALLY WED. WHEN THEY EXCHANGED THEIR VOWS AND COULD TRULY DO THAT, WAS I EMOTIONAL? YES. Hurley: THAT WAS SORT OF THE INDIRECT PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE OF THAT LOVE THAT WE SHARE FOR EACH OTHER. WELL, THEY WOULDN'T BE SECRETS IF I TOLD YOU, SO I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU EVERYTHING. THE WHOLE PROCESS OF ACCEPTING SOMETHING -- THE PROCESS GETS EASIER AS TIME GOES ON. I THINK AS HISTORY STARTS TO UNFOLD, THAT PEOPLE WILL MAYBE LOOK AT ME DIFFERENTLY. I AM HAPPY WHO I AM. I AM REALLY LUCKY TO HAVE THE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE IN MY LIFE THAT ARE CLOSE TO ME, AND I WOULD NOT TRADE THAT IN FOR ANYTHING, PERIOD. PeG@SuS Urang Sunda Asli
