Nikkatsu Presents Kyushuu - Hakata Kyu-shuu University Kyu-shuu University HIGH SCHOOL BIG PANIC University Entrance Mock Exam - Results Good morning everyone Today I have some very sad news As you may have already seen in the newspapers, the day before yesterday, in the afternoon, Tanaka Shouji from the 3rd grade, class 7, passed away. With you I would like to offer my deepest condolences. It is utterly regrettable that this tragedy has emerged from our Nakasu High School. with its simple and sturdy tradition Some newspapers have carried irresponsible reports. stating that the reason behind Tanaka's death is due to his poor results in the mock exam for entry to Kyushuu University. and the demanding nature of Nakasu High School's education system. which focuses upon these entrance exams Indeed Tanaka was upset. but there is much doubt that the pressures of the university entrance exam. or Tanaka's mock results were a main factorbehind his death Even his parents say that they do not know the real reason behind his suicide Therefore you should all avoid making any careless statements when talking to people outside of this school Indeed, there are issues that surround the University entrance exams, and yes they are severe. However, I cannot believe that someone would end their life... just because they have been beaten by this! I would like to conclude today by saying that I hope that... all of you students will not be distracted by this incident. Take care of yourhealth and study harder Ah... it's frnished... let's start. Sir, this is a good time for class discussion. I know that, but we never have anything to discuss, so we always do maths. Well, I think that we have got something to talk about today! What is it? If it's about Tanaka, the speech made by our Principal said it all. What about the rest of you? Is that... OK with everybody? At least this time there is no harm in talking about Tanaka, is there? But, talking about him doesn't make anything better. Tanaka has lost. Crying won't bring him back. You must be strong and be winners in your university entrance exams. Solve as many maths problems as you can. If you are careless then we will be beaten by... Kyugakukan High School in next year's exam rankings. Jono? Jono, what is it? It was you who killed Tanaka! What did you say? Why would I kill Tanaka? You still don't get it! I don't have time to play with an idiot. Question 27 in your maths books. This problem has become a basis for questions in recent... Kyushuu University entrance exams. It's important. - Mr. lhara, are you really ok? - Oh, it's nothing. But that quiet Jono did this? Mr. Ogata, I think we should report this to the Vice Principal and make an issue of it. Hitting a Teacher, as if we were in another violent high school - it must not be allowed in our school. What you are saying is right, but Jono is not very good at maths... and this is why he became upset and did such a terrible thing. But, we cannot drop our maths lecture level just to suit a student like Jono. It is the same with your Japanese literature classes. Yes, it is but... Well, I let him off this time. He seemed to be upset about Tanaka's death. That Jono, eh? Is there only death for the youth of today!? Why did he kill himself? I don't understand. - Jono hit Mr. lhara! - What? Look, Jono did this... Mr. lhara was bleeding from his nose. Hey, it's Tanaka - Tanaka is in the newspaper. He wasn't good at maths. I feel sorry for him, but what he did was wrong... CONSTRUCTION - DO NO TENTER - Is that Baba? - Yes. - Finally done it! - Yeah. I can't stand this anymore. I want everyone to get together and beat up lhara. That's not enough for me - I want to fucking kill him! Yeah. lhara Die. Die! Hello Sonny, how about it? I'll give you Student discount! Hakata Gun Store Show me this one. Well, please come over here... What are you doing? Thief, thief! THIEF! Call the police! Sir, that boy is a student of Nakasu high school. - What!? Nakasu high school? - Yes, defrnitely. Tanaka, if you can't understand a lecture of this level... don't even think about getting a place at Kyushuu University. Everyone suffers if I drop the level of my lectures. This High School has a high standard of education; it would be pointless if we dropped those standards! Jukenn ko no imiga nai Murakami... You are on an employment course, right? It's because you are on this employment course, that you don't have time to study. - If you can't do it, stand outside. - Yes. Baba, did you do your preparatory study? Yes, but... It's impossible not to understand, if you've really done it. I have done it, I just didn't understand. It's not good enough. If you really studied, then a student of this high school can solve this level of problem. You are not trash from some second-rate high school, are you? I am no different from them. What is this sulky attitude of yours?! Good. If you say you are trash... then you must run around the school buildings, like proper trash. And, you must think about the problem while you are running. Go, quickly! How come I have to run, just because I'm no good at maths? How dare you speak against your teacher!? You're not a teacher! You are a monster who only thinks about maths! You think that students who are no good at maths are trash, but maths is not the only thing in life. Wait! You told me to run!! Hey, you! Wait! Hello? Hello? F x 21y x y gxy Yes, it is... Yes, I am Yoneshige, the Vice Principal. Police? Yes... what? A Student from our school stole a rifle? You are joking, aren't you? It can't be. Yes... no, surely a mistake... Hey! Concentrate! What are these students like Baba and Jono thinking about? Listen, you are at the most important stage of your lives, and this summer will decide your futures. Think about your position again. Everyone else is suffering with the heat, too. Well, the violent student has returned! Where have you been? What's wrong with not being good at maths?! I'll kill you!!! What's happened? Who... who did this? - It was Jono! - With a rifle! Jono? Did Jono do this? I can't believe it. Is it really true it was a student from our school? There was a call from a gun shop It is no mistake What does he look like? He is approximately 1m 70cm. slim Slim? Vice Principal! Something terrible has happened. What is it? lhara has been shot dead. A female student also. Jono did it. - Where? - 3rd grade class 7. It's upstairs. Homicide at the high school, requesting backup team and an ambulance. The suspect who is a student might go over there. so stay alert Roger that. The suspect just fled into a school building. You shouldn't say anything about teacher lhara yet. I have to speak calmly - calmly... - Information to all the teachers... - Oh - the switch, the switch! Message to all teachers... all teachers report to the staff room immediately. For the students: all the students must remain in your class rooms. You must not go outside your class room Do you understand? I repeat Everyone understand? Stay in class and study for yourselves Don't go outside Hurray!!! Hey! Do you remember there was a call that said a bomb had been planted? This must be it! I... am trash, I... am trash... Hey, Jono, you... What's wrong with not being good at maths!? I'll kill you!!! Kids today... I'll fucking kill him! I'll fucking kill him! He is underage. We are not allowed to fire a shot, unless in extreme circumstances. I know that, Sir, but... I'll fucking kill him! Hey, Baba. What the hell are you doing here? Get out! Get out! Where is the injured person? We took her to the sickbay. You haven't found him yet? No, Sir. - Crime scene is 3rd grade, class 7, right? - Yes, Sir. - Get up there and take charge. - Yes, Sir. Everyone, calm down. Detectives, detectives... Quickly! This is Jono's desk... Let's begin the evacuation from the music room, and then each classroom on the third floor. Teachers, please avoid confusion and keep them in order. Hold on a moment... I'm Kurita, Chief of Special Investigations from the prefectural police department, and this is senior staff, Kojima. From now on, I am in charge of the situation. Kobayashi, the Principal. Yoneshige, the Vice Principal. Until we know where Jono is, delay the evacuation. Mr. Kurita, we are in a situation in which there might be another victim if we don't evacuate the students. We teachers put students' lives first, and... Where is the desk of the murdered teacher? This is it. What is this Jono like? Any record of drug use? No, absolutely not. This school is one of the frnest schools in the prefecture, with a long tradition. Attention all students: there is a student carrying a gun within the school. He is extremely dangerous... but as long as you stay in your classrooms, there is no danger to you. Until your home room teacher comes to get you, do not leave your class rooms. I repeat... That's him! Chase him! Stop! Stop! Stop! This way! Let me go! - Where is he? - In the Lady's room. Is there anyone in there? Suspect is currently in the Lady's room, on the first floor. Lady's Room h er e r r Alright, contain him in that restroom, and rescue the hostage. Teacher, let students in this part of the second floor evacuate first. Be very careful - don't let any harm come to the students. I'll fucking kill you! That fucking kid! I'll fucking kill him! Jono! Stop! The suspect attempted to shoot some students. Detective Hirose was left with no choice but to shoot. The suspect seemed to suffer a leg wound. We are facing the suspect in the corridor on the third floor Between us and the suspect. there are a few students Alright, our priority here is to rescue the students, and then contain the suspect. Did he shoot Jono? He was left with no choice. You don't plan to kill him, do you? Principal, Jono killed Mr. lhara, and seriously injured a police offrcer. If a student got killed in our school, it would become a huge issue and our school's tradition and reputation would be ruined. - Tradition and reputation? - Yes, tradition and reputation. Principal, at the moment in this school... a crazy gun-wielding lunatic is running around inside the school, where it should be peaceful! A murder has occurred. Furthermore, it was a student who murdered his teacher. I am responsible for all the events in this school. I'm not talking about who is responsible. At this moment, our priority is to catch the suspect. Kojima, contact headquarters. And, call Jono's parents. The suspect has started to shoot again We're pinned down! - What are you doing? - What if we hit the other students? This is Yamauchi. please respond What should we do? Shoot him; our priority is to rescue the students. Roger Hello? Is this the Chief? Kurita. What's happening? I request the special armed force. I think they're better equipped to deal with this. Very well. But make your decision carefully on the scene. Be careful and watch your step. Don't shoot! Don't come near me! Let's go. Get out of my way! Quick. quick! It's crazy, everyone is crazy... How many people are there in the library? 8 or 10... I don't know. You don't know!? I heard the announcement, but I thought it was about the heat, so I didn't think about it... There's an emergency stairwell at the back, right? Yes, but it's closed at certain times, and the key to the door has been lost. The fire brigade said if the door is locked, it doesn't work as an emergency exit. - So it won't open, right? - Yes, it's made of thick iron. Get out. Go! The TV crew is here... Teacher! Call an ambulance. Has he been a good student? He is not the kind of person who would do this. He was a quiet person; no one really noticed him. But he's done this, so there must be something different about him. Well, our school doesn't have school trips, but Jono said that we should have them, and got told off by a teacher. Was he close to Tanaka, who committed suicide? We never saw them talking together. He is trying to be cool, and we are suffering for it. I think he's gone crazy because of this heat. But he can relax now, 'cause he doesn't need to take the entrance exam! Perhaps if Mr. lhara had let us talk about Tanaka when Baba mentioned it, this wouldn't have happened. But the lecture is more important than what happened to Tanaka. Mr. lhara was unlucky. It's not about luck; Jono is to blame. Violence is not acceptable! But without Mr. lhara, our school's grades will drop quite a lot. Our pass rate for the Kyushuu University entrance exam... might be beaten by Shugakukan. Jono... what did you do? I fucking killed lhara! You're joking, right? What's so funny!? Did Yasuhiro do something bad? I'll tell you about that on the way. Please come with me. Please wait a moment, I need to get ready. Madam, there is no time for that. We are in a hurry. Is it true? Well, your son stole a rifle and shot a school teacher. What? What happened!? He is barricading himself in the school building. We want you two to persuade him to give himself up. Offrcer, what happened to the teacher? e d ed r r This can't be true. Quick, let's go. Baba, I heard you're... on the same track team as Jono and you're his only friend, right? Could you persuade him to give himself up? I beg you. Yeah - if Jono keeps resisting, things could get even worse. You are the only chance we've got. Please... I can't do it. Why? Are you not friends? Friends... you say, but since we started third grade, we've hardly talked. But... but now, I totally understand. Yes, you understand. No! What I mean is... I would have... I would have... done the same thing! Well, he can't help us. Detective... I will give it a try. It is my responsibility as the guidance councillor of this high school. I'll try. Jono, can you hear me? We won't shoot you, so drop your gun and come out. What you have done - your parents, teachers and your friends are worried, but if you come out soon. everything will be OK Jono, you can trust us - drop your gun, release the hostages, and come out quickly. Yabachi, this teacher will replace you. Jono, this is Ogata. I understand that you didn't like Mr. lhara, but you have committed a very serious crime. Don't you think you should atone for this crime like a man? If you do that, your reasons will... Help!!! Stop that!!! Let me go... let me go! Boss, there has been an incident at the emergency stairs. You teachers, please come with us. - Are you alright? - Call an ambulance! Hold on! Is she alright? What a terrible thing! Miss Yoshike, Miss Yoshike, can you hear me? Special Armed Force, respond. Yes, Special Armed Force responding. We have arrived at the back entrance of the High School. Ready and waiting. Good, be ready and wait for my word. Roger Jono, please listen to me... With you - I think it was last summer - we drank together and you told me your troubles. It's not too late; let's talk about what you are going to do. If you atone for your crime there may be mitigating circumstances. You are still young and have a bright future. Jono. do you understand what I am saying? Do you? h s ay Jono's parents have arrived. We are so sorry... I understand how you feel, but at the moment your son is in a state of hysteria. Talk to him as parents... please! I'm not good at talking... you should do it! No, you should! You fool, quick! Yasuhiro Yasuhiro... can you hear me? Your mother and father are here Please, please come out quickly. Please give yourself up! If you don't, your mother and father can't face the world! We can't live! Yasuhiro. release yourfriends. please What have you done? You may have some frustrations. our company home is small compared to your friends'. I'm sorry you don't even have a study room but soon we will ask the company to expand our home. And for your lunch I will buy you a better lunchbox, so you can take a warm meal and soup with you to school And you said that you wanted... What was it? Yasuhiro, do you understand what you are doing now? You can't escape from here! Come out now, give yourself up like a man, apologise to the world and receive your penalty. If you can't do this you are not a man! Shut Up!!! Go home... please go home! Why did you come to this High School? To go to Kyushuu University? If you can't do maths, then that would be a joke! Quit now! Shut Up!!! Let's give him some time to cool down. Kojima, take the parents downstairs. Yasuhiro! Yasuhiro! - Look after them. I will stay here. - Okay. hm do He fired on his own parents! He is completely insane. The police must be thinking about a last resort strategy. Can you allow such a measure? And you call yourself an educator?! You seem to think that Jono deserves to be killed. Such an idea is ludicrous! I don't know if it is ridiculous or not but in reality he killed lhara, seriously injured a police offrcer and a fellow student! That's right! In the first place, you are opposed to our schools education policy... which focuses on the University entrance exam, in which lhara believed strongly. Indeed, but because of this incident our education policy comes into question. That's why we need to catch Jono alive... and ask him the reason why he did this, so we can learn from it. Jono... stop this meaningless act and let us go. It's because you're not good at maths that you're doing all this? Why did you get me involved? Mr. lhara taught us very well and he was a good, reliable teacher. You killed such a good teacher! If I don't get into Kyushuu University, it's all your fault! You don't understand anything about me!! Want me to fucking kill you too? Female students Tokuda and Murakami are still... - OK, two female students, right? - Yes. This is Yamauchi... This is Yamauchi... At this time, the suspect has barricaded himself into the library... on the third floor, with two female students as hostages. There are no new developments to report, with the situation at stalemate. However, for this sad tragedy to occur in such a reputable high school, one of the frnest high schools in the prefecture, makes us consider the possible flaws in the education system. A student shot a teacher in the classroom - this is never heard of! How disgraceful! This is all because of those red teachers, who worship false post-war 'democratic education'. They allow students to enjoy freedom for nothing... and this is the result of immersing themselves in the red politics of their youth! Hey, shut it! In my house there is a sick relative, so be quiet! Shut up you! We are not just talking about trivial personal issues! Whether my sick Grandmother lives or dies... is much more important than 'democratic education' or reds! What did you say?! The school gate has been closed by riot police because of the mounting number of reporters here There has been a small scuffle between journalists and riot police On the other hand it has been five minutes since the last gunshots There have been an increasing number of onlookers arriving Hey... listen to me everyone! Today's youth are no good because they don't run. Look at me. Building a brighter town through running! When you run, a fountain of life springs forth! It's because they are always sitting behind a desk that this kind of thing happens! You are an idiot! You can't get into University just by running! You have too much free time. What is more important? University or building a brighter town? If you fail your entrance exam... and have to scrape around to frnd another university, your future is frnished! Running can't help! You have too much free time. You dare to... contradict my beliefs?! You do not know the purpose or motivation of the suspect, right? Not yet. There is no evidence of organised crime or drug use, but there is obviously something that has triggered this. - Did he make any demands? - No. The suspect is an underage high school student. Are you considering shooting the suspect... as happened in the 'Seajack' and the 'Nagasaki Busjack' incidents? At the moment our priority is to save lives. We will try our best to persuade him to surrender. We are not thinking about anything else at this time. That's all. This heat is killing me! Could you open the curtain? What the hell are you doing?! water! What are you going to do? I'll run! You can't escape. I will. If I say so, I will! Jono, you must be hungry. We will bring you some food, but don't shoot. I don't want to eat anything! Mr. Kurita, I have a favour to ask. What is it? I want to replace the hostages. Replace them? But do you think he will agree? Yes, I have talked to Jono about his problems a few times in the past. I think that if I ask him, he may listen to me. Mr. Ogata, if you do this, it might provoke Jono again. But if something happens to the hostages, that would be a disaster. - You're right, but... - OK then, let's try this. Jono, this is Mr. Ogata. How are you doing? I have a favour to ask; listen carefully. I'd like to come over there and become your hostage, in exchange for the two female students. Hey, can you hear me? Your hostages must be feeling weak: you should let them go. Are you ready? I'm coming; I am alone and unarmed. If you agree, why don't you answer me? You don't reply, so you must agree, right? OK, I'm coming! That kid, I hate him! It doesn't matter now! I'll kill him! He came to this place to get into University... and he has abandoned the most important thing: his education!! He should never have come here in the first place! I am the mother of Murakami Miyoko. Is my daughter still alive? We can assure you that we will get her back unharmed. I am the father of Tokuda Naomi. Your daughter is alive and well too. I am totally relying on you - please take care of it. Please come this way. Principal, I know my occupation is questionable, but I trusted this school. - My trust has been betrayed! - Sorry, madame, but we are doing our best. I cannot believe this! Sorry solves nothing! Excuse me, why don't we talk to my son again? You're the suspect's parents, aren't you? He has two parents and he turns out like this! You should apologise to him unreservedly! What are you going to do if something happens to her? There is a new development. We will let you know more as soon as we get all the details... Have located suspect. He has a hostage and is proceeding to the back gate. OK, move along the back fence and meet us. Report this to the riot police, but don't let him get outside of the school's perimeter. Are you OK? Wait... Take her to her father. Safe? Safe and well?! Where is my daughter? The suspect has entered a building on the roof. I repeat. the suspect has entered a building on the roof What? A building on the roof? Yes. Sir That building is a science lab. There are many dangerous chemicals in there, so please hurry. To the roof immediately! Miyoko... where is my Miyoko? Special Armed Unit... Receiving you, over. The suspect has entered a science lab on the roof. Get up there immediately and stand by. Suspect has one hostage, a female student. Roger Excuse us, please excuse us - my daughter is very tired. We shall hold a press conference at my company later on. Nami, hang in there, Nami! - Is that it? - Yes. Aren't you scared? No... because it has got nothing to do with me. Nothing to do with you? You were singing in the classroom, earlier. It was in the maths class... It was a broken word It was a broken crest of a wave It was a broken red umbrella Cigarette? You often ran on your own, didn't you? You shouldn't have stopped. Why? No reason... You can't escape anymore. I don't care anymore. In the end I'll kill myself anyway. I don't think you should pretend to be something you're not. I'm not pretending! The Yamagasa Festival starts soon... It will be so busy. I really like it. I really like the masculinity of this festival. But you won't be there, as you need to prepare for next year's entrance exams. I will! es Get down! What is it? On top of that roof there are policemen with rifles. Smoke! Smoke! Call the Fire Brigade! My daughter... My daughter is in there! Special Armed Force... Special Armed Force... Receiving. over Can you see inside? At the moment we cannot see anything, because of the smoke. OK, when you see him... take him out. Roger that. Jono, come out quickly - you'll be burned to death! ey ! This is Mizoguchi This is Mizoguchi Please respond What happened? Mistaken identity; we shot the hostage. OK, hold your fire, fall back and report to the chief. All personnel on the roof: storm the building! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! I've got a University entrance exam next year! There are going to be radio lectures! Let me go! There are going to be radio lectures! There are going to be radio lectures! I have an entrance exam next February! Murakami's mother will hate us if she frnds out. It's over. Miyoko, why did you alone have to suffer such a terrible fate? What am I going to do... on my own? Miyoko! - Yoneshige... - Yes? - What... time is it? - Well, er... Tomorrow, we can continue our classes as normal, can't we? Yes, Sir. Everything we have worked for up until this day is ruined. Yasuhiro... will he ever get a job? It's going to be alright. We've got to make it right... I've got an entrance exam! There will be radio lectures! There will be radio lectures! I've got an entrance exam next year! I've got an entrance exam next February!
