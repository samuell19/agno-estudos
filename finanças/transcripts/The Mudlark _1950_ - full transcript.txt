Legend has it that in the thirty-ninth year of His Majesty's reign, a child added a footnote to the history of England. Boat! Damn! -Give me that! -No, it's mine, it's mine! Drop those boots, I've seen them first! They are mine! -I'll give you two pence for him. -No sir. -Six. -No sir. -Nine. -I don't want to sell it. I'll give you another chance, Mister Wheeler, leave it or take it. One shilling. I don't want to sell it for nothing, sir. I want to keep it. Then take it away, you filthy vermin. You are an immature and selfish urchin, and I don't want to see you around here again, do you understand? -Yes sir. -Well, walk. Go away. Get out. And I have been like a father to him. Listen... Would you give me a shilling for that? -Could you get it? Wait. Sleep here somewhere. -Give it to me! -Do not! -I already have it! -Let's go! Please, Sparrow! Please don't take it from me. Please, Herbert! Please, Sparrow. Please, Herbert. Sparrow! Herbert! Please, Herbert! -Again you! -We have not done anything! -I've been robbed! -It is not true! -Yes, they have robbed me! -No, we haven't stolen anything! Shut up for once, if you don't want me to throw you into the river! Well, what happened? He took the portrait from me while I was sleeping. What portrait? Where is it? Here. No! Young guy! -Please sir! -Get out of there right now! I can't swim, sir. He cannot swim. You are a weird boy. So much appreciation do you feel for her? Yes sir. I guess so. There aren't many like her today. It could be said that she lives cloistered Like a nun in that damn castle They say: what good is it to England to have it now? What happens to him? She has been mourning the death of her husband for fifteen years. -She's crazy? -Is it? No, boy. What happens is that she is an old woman, an old woman with a crown of sadness on her head and his heart no longer wants to know anything. -You know what they called her, right? -How? The mother of England. That is, the mother of all England, as if we were all her children. Millions and millions of damn kids to worry about. Poor woman. It looks like a mother. It's normal, he had nine children. Or did you mean your mother? No, I don't have a mother. -Who cares you? Your father? -No, I don't have a father either. -Who do you have? -To nobody. I think that she would worry first about those who are like you, if he cares about something now, of course. -Who is she? -Who is who? -This lady. -The one with the portrait? -Yes sir. -Victoria, of course. Who do you think we were talking about? Yes sir, but who is Victoria? You ask me who is Victoria, the queen of your country? I hadn't heard of her, sir. -Not even your name? "Not that I remember, sir." Let me be struck by lightning if I had heard anything like this in my life! -Have you heard of England? "Yes, sir, from England yes." -What is it? -It's a place, right? -A place from where? -From London, sir. No, no, boy, it's the other way around. London is in England, not England in London. London is just this old city that we are in. But England is all this fucking territory And that lady, as you say, is the queen of the bloody business. -I'm afraid I don't know many things. -No, I see it. I'm so busy looking for things that I don't have time to find out what happens. -Do you know how to read? -No sir. Well that's the lady. Wait a minute, boy. If you haven't heard of His Majesty, Why did you risk your life in searching for the medallion? I liked your face, sir. -Her face? -Yes sir. Looks like what you said, sir, a mother. Didn't you say you didn't have a mother? Anyone's mother. Like mine, if I had it. I'll take another look at it. Yeah, maybe you're right, boy. I'd like to see her in person. Now there are few possibilities. She is locked in that damn castle. -What castle, sir? -Windsor. I guess you won't know Windsor either. No sir. Let's see what you know, that will be a good start. And the Thames? Know what it is? -Yes, sir, the river. -Yes. -It's where I work, in the mud. -Yes, it's true, boy. Windsor is up the Thames, about twenty miles. There, on the riverbank, is that damn castle, a castle so old that nobody knows who started it or when. But the conqueror lived there and so did Ricardo Corazón de León. One king after another, one queen after another, like Henry VIII, Carlos I and poor George III when he went mad. Windsor Castle is a good part of England's history, but apparently happier places for a widow's retirement. Vete. You heard. Go away. -Stop, who's going? -The Prime Minister, Mr. Disraeli. -Yes? -Brown wishes to see you, sir. Mr. Brown, the Scotsman? -There is no doubt about it. -I'll go right away. The prime minister will come immediately. Sit down. No. How do you do, Mr. Brown? Glad to see you again. -Are you ready to see her? -What do you think? Good thing the prime minister doesn't have to wear the kilt. I agree with you. The subject that brings me is very serious to walk with comedies. How is Your Majesty? What mood are you in this week? Just like these years. Does he show any inclination to leave this unhealthy confinement? -Have you come for that? -The topic may come up. Then waste your time. In certain matters she is very sensible, but on that one she is as stubborn as a mule. I remind you that you are speaking of Her Majesty the Queen. -If you're ready, let's go there, sir. -You first. -Mr. Disraeli ... -Yes? -Oh yeah. -That man is drunk. Moderately How dare you present yourself to His Majesty in such a state? It is a more or less permanent state, you cannot avoid it. And does she tolerate it? Mr. Brown is an inheritance from the deceased. He was a friend and servant of Prince Albert. His widow not only tolerates these legacies, she pampers them, no matter how thirsty they may be. -Comes? -Open the way. There have never been practical difficulties in these cases, And no person with self-love has ever felt sorry because you have been prohibited from accepting the Foreign Order. Mr. Disraeli, ma'am. Always a pleasure to see you, Mr. Disraeli. May God save our Queen. -Not all right? "No one is quite well, ma'am." I'm sorry for you. Brown, a chair for Mr. Disraeli. Your Majesty is very kind, but I would rather stand there and warm up. -Of course. The prince liked to stand there, he would get up from time to time, and it burned. -And with what dignity! His Royal Highness was an example to all in the smallest details of the life. Everyone came to appreciate it ... in the end, right? Okay, let's talk business first, then we will enjoy the rest of the evening. -What is it about this time? -Business, ma'am? Please, Mr. Disraeli, I know very well that you have not come this far just to see an old woman. -It's true, ma'am. I came to see one of the most fascinating women in England, in his enchanted tower. But I admit that I have prepared a little excuse. You are very funny, Mr. Disraeli, really. What is the excuse for today? I wanted to tell you personally that we have controlled the riots and that there is no immediate danger. I see that it is as convoluted as ever. What uproar? They begin as debates about the regrettable and long absence of Her Majesty of London. -Yes, I know. But lately they have turned into something more serious. The other night thousands of people gathered in the demonstration in front of Buckingham Palace after someone placed The "for rent" sign on the door. -To rent? By his absence, they meant that the tenant was gone forever. Can I continue with this matter? -If you think you should. -I believe it, ma'am. There is no one in the world who feels more sorry for the pain of His Majesty that this true friend and faithful subject, nor that I am in a better position to understand that I need to be alone, but I think the time has come for His Majesty to reflect again about its convenience. -I ask you to be careful. I intend to be as careful as circumstances allow. But matters of great importance are at stake, and it may take some nerve. For example, the government reform program, a matter that I know is close to His Majesty's heart. I don't see the relationship between my personal regret and a proposal to improve the conditions of the town. Allow me Your Majesty to trace that relationship. The chances of the program being approved are five to one. Proposals for the demolition of poor neighborhoods, public housing, educational facilities for the poor, they are all wise and plausible measures and therefore they will meet great opposition. The British are a proud and independent people, and they won't accept upgrades without a fierce fight. I only know one power in the country capable of turning it around to this almost certain defeat. I thought you made it clear that you approved of these measures. Words will not be enough to achieve this victory, not even his. I asked you to be careful, Mr. Disraeli. I'm afraid I have to take a chance. The country has discovered a certain inconsistency between the words and the works of His Majesty. In his words they find only love, sympathy and understanding. In His Majesty's long seclusion I regret to tell you that they do not find nothing like it. They remember with what kindness he used to move through his kingdom, it was a light that illuminated not only England, but the whole world. At that time you were Great Britain in person, It gave him hope and happiness of the people. He went on vacation to Liverpool and partying in Bristol. There was music of trumpets and drums wherever he went. Men, women, and children cheered her as she passed. But I would be lying if I said that this would happen today. Conversations about his abdication abound. Republicanism, once hidden, is almost a fad. It has been discussed about him in the House of Commons. And in the House of Lords, someone had the audacity to ask what England gets in exchange for the hundreds of thousands of pounds that are paid annually by the royal institution now that its ceremonial function has disappeared. How can they say those things when i'm so miserable and i'm so lonely? Let me contradict you for once. She is not alone, not remotely. He has 30,000,000 friends in England who only ask for the opportunity to show him again, face to face, who love her. -What do you propose? It is an invitation, from the leaders of the Lambeth Foundling Hospital, requesting the honor of His Majesty's presence at the celebration of its centenary. The occasion itself is of no great importance, but it would be impossible to list the advantages it would have May His Majesty accept the invitation. Yes, this is what I was afraid of. I only ask His Majesty to examine the circumstances. Why do they insist on purely decorative duties? In a sense the flag is also just decorative. I do not enjoy my misfortune, Mr. Disraeli. Surely you know it better than anyone else in the world. But what can I do? I am alone and I am often scared. I admit it. But here, among the objects that are familiar to me or in Balmoral, a place he loved even more, I have a certain strength and courage. I think I get it from him, from the memories he left me. -Can you understand that? "Certainly, ma'am." We spend so much time together in this room. It was his favorite. I still see him moving this pen between his fingers while examining some document that I should understand and sign. One night he insisted that I should read this book that he had loved. One night we argued about that painting, whether they resembled children or not. He would sit in this chair I was reading under that lamp. He stoked the fire with that poker. We went to the dining room from here and he led me down the hall by the arm. We would smile at each other at the table, because ... we were thinking the same thing at the same time. Any part of Windsor holds memories of you and as long as I have them around, I feel capable of continuing. I am afraid that without them I could not. Do you understand what I am saying? Perfectly, ma'am. Surely she will say that it is sad to live like this, like a prisoner, and it certainly is. But I'm afraid it's the only thing left for me. Forgive me, ma'am, but I would be greatly surprised that these memories of His Royal Highness do not bring to mind which remains the British sovereign. I don't know how I can handle it, Mr. Disraeli, I don't know. The very idea of ​​going out again fills me with dread. But if you really think it's that important, I will try to gather the courage to do it. Thank you, gracious Majesty. If you'll excuse me ... Wait! High or tall! Turn around! March on. In the garden below. Let the night be explained ... come by the garden wall ... ... that I'm here at the door, alone. Charles, you must not be here. What do you want? -Your mother is here. -When I arrive? Just a moment ago, to speak to the Queen. -Have you told him something about us? -Not because? I know I should have told you earlier. I was waiting for an occasion. The truth is that I wrote a letter to your father. Really? Someone is coming. See you later. -Yes? -He wants to see you now. -Right now? -Yes right now. -My mother is with Her Majesty? -Yes. We don't have much time before dinner, Emily, so answer briefly. Who is this Lieutenant McHatten? -Why? -You know him, right? Yes, Your Majesty. It belongs to the guard. Have you had any dates with him? I assure you, no ma'am. Believe me Yes, we have seen each other, but always in circumstances of maximum decorum. And we have always talked about inconsequential topics. Can you give an example? -Of poetry. -How interesting. -Whose? - From Mr. Tennyson. It's kind of lovely, Margaret. -Does he also recite poems to you? -Yes ma'am. I have never seen anything so beautiful. A guard and dear Mr. Tennyson. When did this recital take place, my dear? During the day or at night? During the night, ma'am, but very early. In the palace or under the stars? Under the ... it was outside the palace. Very appropriate. Do you remember the poem that you thought he recited the best? I'm afraid I can't now, ma'am. The second best? I don't remember either. The third? Those moments of leisure are so easily forgotten. But if there is nothing else, it is not possible that you have given permission to ask for your hand in marriage, right? My hand? But he hasn't. Has not been able. -I know him so little. -You allow me, Your Majesty? Of course, Margaret. Emily, dear, it's an impossible situation. You are the daughter of a nobleman. You are a maid of honor in Her Majesty's service. You have the opportunity and the obligation to make a distinguished marriage. Don't get around those considerations by choosing a nobody. He is not a nobody. He's less than that, he's the son of a clergyman. Emily, in these situations, there is only one solution. Whatever the suitability of the young man, your mother always knows what is best for you. For his sake and for your own, I forbid you to see him again. Do you forbid me? But it's not fair, Your Majesty. -Emily! -I'm afraid it's changed. I beg your pardon, Your Majesty. The obvious solution is to move him away from here, move him immediately. Move it to where? Outside of England, wherever. Maybe to India. That's not fair either, punishing him because of me. -Emily, you must control yourself. "But it's not fair, Your Majesty." I don't want to be rude, but it is not a crime to ask me in marriage. We are not in the middle ages and His Majesty is not an absolutist monarch. Believe me, I am your loyal sudden, but I am also an adult that I was born free and I will marry whoever I want, not whoever they tell me. Go to your room and don't leave there. -I beg your pardon, Your Majesty. -And pray to God to forgive you! I can't find words, Your Majesty. Please. Please, Margaret. Wait some minutes. A wax stain on the carpet. Clean it up. -Yes sir. - Someone's carelessness. Yes sir. -Who has moved this? -I don't know, sir. Someday I will write a book about what I have suffered in this position. Yes sir. -What are you doing here? -I don't do anything wrong. Friend. You are stupid? Do you want the guards to find you? I did nothing. I swear not. Are you the son of a merchant? Yes. How reckless you are when you enter his dining room. A dirty kid like you. Let's see if I can get you out of here. Wait wait. Sergeant. Put that bowl upright. Good. That's all. You can go. What about you, girl? Haven't you finished yet? One moment, sir. Only be a moment. You can't stay here all night. Damn big! Miss Noonan! You are ascending. It's the first time I've seen you in this room. It's you, Mr. Slattery! May I ask you what does it matter if I ascend or not? -You're not very sociable tonight. -As long as I do my homework, no. And perhaps in other circumstances? I have told him that I cannot speak now. It will have to be soon, because I have big plans. I may not be with you for long. -What an important man. -Do you doubt my courage? Roll your eyes in this direction, little girl. Slattery! Do you intend to burn us all alive? I was just practicing to show you how easy it would be. Did you practice? May the saints protect us! -Has he gone crazy? -Crazy? For burning Windsor Castle? No, girl, it would be an act that would gladden many hearts tonight in Ireland. Those words would be enough to hang him. How do you think it would be with its neck hanging from a rope? Would you be the first to risk your neck for the sake of Ireland? No, Slattery, usted no. I wouldn't burn down a castle for 100 years. No? You may not have realized how simple it would be. A little around here, and a little more around here. And a little more down here and here. For Saint Patrick! What is that? No, nothing of that, boy! -Don't hurt him, Slattery, please! -I didn't do anything, boss, I swear. Is it nothing to be hidden under Her Majesty's table? -Leave him alone, he's just a boy. -What do you say? A snake under his table and you take his side? Is that your son? I'm a lady, please! All right, lass, don't talk any more. We'll see what Mr. Naseby has to say on the matter. I, in your place, Mr. Castles Burning, would think twice Before telling Mr.Naseby anything about the boy, lest I have heard the damning words he has spoken. You haven't heard them. Have you heard them? -Yes. -May heaven protect you! What are you two still doing here? Quick, disappear! -Please sir. -Come on, girl. Come on, girl. They will arrive at any moment. His Royal Highness was always fond of traveling. I suppose you were right in describing dear Albert as tireless, because he liked to go out to see my town. But although he loved London very much, he preferred the Scottish highlands. He loved their clothes, their customs, even their bagpipes. I remember once in Baltimore ... Any problem, ma'am? I thought I heard a strange noise. Has anyone heard it? -Do not. -No ma'am. Listen. They are his imaginations. Keep eating dinner. How weird. -Where was it? -I was telling them about the bagpipes. -Yes, yes ... -They touch them so often. First, at dawn. Then in the morning. Again after lunch and sometimes in the afternoon, before dinner, during dinner, after dinner they have ... Haven't they heard? -No ma'am. -I have not heard anything. How did it sound? Like a strong breath. Naseby, do you have asthma? A strong breath or, although it seems impossible, a snoring. -A snoring? -Listen. There is someone else in this room! Please accompany the ladies. In there. -Come here! -There is! I have it, sir, I have it! -He's just a brat. -What are you doing here, boy? -God, it sucks! -There's no doubt, sir. Take it away from here. It will mess up the dining room. Yes sir. I'll have it washed immediately. But I don't want to be washed! Let go of me, you giant pig! They have no right to wash me! I don't want to be washed! -Let go of me! -Shut up, flea sack! Let go of me I haven't done anything, boss! What age? -I would say no more than ten years. -So he was just a boy? -A brat like my thumb. -Thats weird. I am investigating to find out if he is not the ringleader of a huge and lethal plot. -Is that what you think? They also have their responsibilities. I don't know, sir. Maybe he's armed with a blowgun. In other words, there are still flaws in the wonderful portrait. of universal love that has painted me tonight. What's wrong with you, ma'am? Your children never made a mischief? Mischief! Who knows what the boy's intentions were? I can't forget that there have been six attempts to finish with the life of His Majesty. I have no illusions that my popularity is or was unanimous. But as the years go by, I care less the feelings of the crowds. I don't give a damn that those manifestations you talk about are caused by affection or just hatred. Maybe they weren't out of affection, but they certainly weren't out of hatred. At most it was resentment, the resentment of people deprived of someone they loved. Have you ever had reason to complain about compliance of my duties, Mr. Disraeli? -No ma'am. Have I neglected them in any way? No ma'am. You or one of your ministers have had a hard time talk to me when there are matters to discuss? Never, ma'am. So I see no reason to alter my current way of life. I don't think I really understand Your Majesty. Don't tell me you will allow the antics of a little one bum influence your decision? It is useless to argue. I have taken a decision. I will support the program in any other way, with letters or statements, but not opening fairs nor greeting the crowd or other nonsense like that. I thought very carefully before making this request. And I decided to do it only when I realized that there was no other force so powerful capable of offering us a chance for success. If I cannot convince Your Majesty of your need, the heavy burden of defeat will not fall on us, but on the poorest and weakest of his people. I urge His Majesty not to lose sight of the harsh consequences. Sorry, but I think there is nothing more to say about it. I will continue to carry out my official duties here, and I will continue to be available to the government within these walls. And so it will be for the rest of my life. And if this arrangement were one day unsatisfactory for the people From great britain, I assure you that I would not stand in the way of succession. If you will excuse me, I will withdraw. -Too much fuss for a little boy! -Wow with that boy of yours! I'm not worried about him, I'm thinking about myself. Goodnight. Good evening, Your Majesty. I trust you sleep well. I think I will, despite everything. I feel much better than could be expected afterwards of such a night. Tea, surely. It was especially good tonight, Brown. The best I've ever had I think. It is natural. He had a good splash of whiskey. There you have it. What did he say? Stubborn as an old mule. Mr. Brown, what expressive power there is in a limited vocabulary. -The face, Thompkins. -Yes sir. -Hopkins. -Yes sir? -The disinfectant. -Yes sir. Watch out, it hurts me! Keep it still. Well, you dirty little beggar, what are you doing in this castle? Nothing, boss, I swear nothing. I just wanted to see her ... Don't lie to me, boy. Don't you dare lie to me. Seriously, boss, ask the man. He will tell you that he was not doing anything. What a man? The man who is going to burn Windsor Castle. -Burn the castle? -I swear on my dead, boss. What man thinks to burn the castle? I don't know his name, boss. What nonsense is that, you lying urchin? Sorry sir. If you don't tell me the truth, I'll have you whipped to death. -Naseby, he's a hick. -How do you say? I say it is a leg. Now step aside, please. Wait a minute, Mr. Brown. You smell like a hospital. He has no authority in this part of the castle. I tell him it's a leg. How do you expect to get something out of the boy if he's scared to death? Listen to me, rogue. Would you like to be hanged? Please sir, I don't want to be hanged. -Then shut up. -Yes sir. What is that of hick? Someone has sent you to this castle, someone with malicious intent. -Who was? Your father? -I don't have a father. -Who brought you here? -No one. I came walking. -From London? -Yes sir. Who introduced you to the castle? -I sneaked in. -What did you sneak in? Who told you to do it? I sneaked in and then fell down a hole. -Which hole did you fall through? -I don't know, sir. Damn, stop whining! You would scare a bear with your wild roars. "Take care of yours, girl." -Check it, sir. -Don't you see you're starving? -Hold your tongue! He has a hungry face. By the way, what kind of man is he? Even in prison they fill a man's belly before hanging him. Won't you do less for this boy? Come on, bring him something to eat. Let's go. Sit down. You may prefer to explain the situation to the duty officer. Stay away, sir. It bothers me. -Here you go sir. Here, boy, help yourself. Let's go eat. Hey, slow down, boy. They don't even do that in Scotland. What about the fork? Have you never seen a fork? Watch You see it? It is done like this. Try it. That's it. Put it in your mouth. What do you do with all that meat in your mouth? Can't you swallow? That's it. Try again. Nerd. It is not a fish that hooks on the tongue. Keep your tongue out of the way until the food is in your mouth. Look, I'll do it again. Watch me You see it? That's it. You just need to practice a little and you will do as well as a count. Come on, try again. Dearest mom. Try to understand it! Your daughter who loves you. Emily. -Mr. McHatten ... -Not now . -You are an officer of the watch, right? -No, I'm off duty. Please come. His Majesty's life may be in danger. -Danger? -Yes sir. We have the murderer in the servants' room. "Good heavens, take me there!" -Yes sir. Charles? Charles? Where is it? -Where is he, woman? -He took it, sir. -Where? -I don't know, sir. I asked him but he gave me such a penetrating look which I did not dare to insist, sir. What the hell is going on? Who has taken it? The Scottish servant, John Brown. He has been very solicitous in this whole affair. Why? He has no more authority here than any other servant. It is possible, but ... Go and find it. Don't stand here babbling. If we lose the tramp, be the fat gun. But I do not know how... He has men at his command. Send them looking for it. Yes sir. It is a good idea. Attention everyone. Brown and the boy are somewhere in the castle. You must find them immediately. I order you to disperse and look for them. Ahead! -Yes sir. -And get smart. Yes sir. -That Scottish idiot! -Yes sir. Right, sir. It's close here, sir. I was starting to believe you, boy, but now you're lying. I know this garden like the back of my hand, and there is not a hole in it. It's true, sir. Mr. Brown! Follow. Afterwards I walked through the corridors, sir. Go on, I hear you. But since I ate so much, I fell asleep. Where is that portrait? Here, sir. Yes, she is. Here is mine. He dedicated it to me in his own handwriting. "To our loyal servant and good friend, John Brown. Victoria, R." It was made fifteen years ago in Osborne and she gave it to me personally. If I hadn't fallen asleep, I would have seen it too. It may not be too late. -What do you mean, sir? -Wait. Let's see what mood I'm in in a moment. -Do you really want to see her? -Yes sir. But I don't want to get in any more trouble. Would you like to see her face to face and tell your story in simple words? I don't know, sir. I could be too scared. Scared? You don't have to be scared. She's just an old lady. She is a very nice old lady. Besides, you'll be with me, boy. Surely nothing's wrong, sir? What? -He's a little drunk. -Drunk? Yes sir. He has been drinking a lot. I need it to keep infection away, boy. Go. You will be very happy to see us. It is a rule that you must remember all your life. Never neglect your health. Go. No boy she does not make any state decisions without consulting me first. -Have you seen it with your eyes? -Yes, Your Majesty. -How does it look like? "Reckless, Your Majesty, reckless." Some say that he is not a child, that he is a dwarf, a dwarf claiming to be a boy. - Did he look like a dwarf? I don't know, ma'am, I've seen so few dwarves. -This is it, Your Majesty? -Yes. -Good night, Ross. -Good evening, Your Majesty. Thanks, Ross. Yes, it is a great castle. Would you like to see something else before we wake her up? If you think it would be safe. -I have an idea. -Which one, sir? We will see the throne first. Go. Here are kept the relics of our great victories. This is where the Kings, the Emperors wait and nababs from India until she receives them. Go. Damn! Ivory and gold. Rubies, emeralds and feldspars from all the treasures of India. By His Majesty. What are you thinking, boy? Mister? Would you like to sit on it? -Do you think I would dare? -Why not? All the young servants sit on it when they don't see them. Come on up, boy. But be careful, don't get your feet dirty on the cushions. Go. How's it going? Do you feel like a king? No sir. But it's a weird feeling. A weird feeling. Maybe that's it. Maybe that's it. A young king a boy king who grants the order of knight to the best captain of his army, who returns home victorious in war. OMG, boss! Get down from there, you dirty beggar. Stop, who goes? Stand back, Brown. I want that child. Really? What a daring soldier, who besieges a little boy with his loyal warriors. No doubt the queen will give you a medal for this. "I'm telling you to step aside, Brown." -And I tell him ... Is it that everyone in the Castle will attack us? I warned you, Brown. What do I see in the distance? The chivalry? Get down from there. Don't move, boy. Don't come down until I tell you. -He's drunk. -Like a vat. Oh yeah? Well, you should be ashamed. Pity for the queen's soldier who does his duty after raising the elbow, shame about the uniform! For the third and final time, Brown, I order you to step aside. And I accept the challenge, cheap hero. -I stand firm as a rock. -Get down from there, Mr. Brown. Who is it? Get out of there and hand the boy over to the lieutenant. I'm not going with him, I'm staying with Mr. Brown. -He can't make me go with him! -Take it. I will not go! Don't touch me with those hooves! One moment! I haven't done anything, let go of me! I did nothing! Help, help! They can't take me! Help! -Naseby ... -Yes, sir? Mr. Brown would be grateful if you could take him to his chambers. Yes sir. It's okay, he's a good boy. Nothing happens. He's just a kid ... Amazing event in Windsor. The threatened queen. The mystery of the dwarf assassin. The news of the Times, logically, is more moderate. Who has told that nonsense? It's hard to know where they got it from. Where is the child? The police took him to London last night. And Brown? They say Brown is unwell this morning. Is Mr. Disraeli gone yet? No ma'am. He's waiting to see His Majesty. -Tell him to come in. -Yes, Your Majesty. -Mr. Disraeli. -Thank you, General. Majesty. -Have you read the Times? -Yes ma'am. He would twist that damn kid's neck. As I have already indicated, I think he takes this incident too seriously. I will not argue that. But if this case is not handled very carefully, it will be ridiculous and embarrassing for everyone. No matter what his purpose was, he is still a child. That is enough to provoke sentimental reactions. As soon as I arrive in London, I will make a statement on the facts that will put an end to these absurd rumors. That is precisely what you should not do. There is no better way to care than the explicit recognition of a member of the government. It must be overcome as soon as possible without comment. But if the question arises officially, say in the Commons, wrapped in an atmosphere of so much mystery, Your Majesty intends to limit me from our discussion? I don't know what happened to you, Mr. Disraeli. I have never seen him so fierce. Won't you abide by my wishes for once? Thanks. Anything else? I hoped that, after a night's reflection, Your Majesty, reconsider ... -Yes, yes. Will you be so kind as to apologize to the gentlemen from the hospital? Yes, Your Majesty. I hope you have a safe trip back. Thank you, Your Majesty. Tower of London. -Merry Christmas, Wheeler. -Thank my Lord. Equally. During interrogations, you have mentioned the following people as friends and acquaintances who could vouch for you and attest to your good behavior. Ben Fox, tramp. Mrs. Feeny, street music, Trafalgar square. Iron George, street vendor, two hooligans named Sparrow and Herbert. Hooker Morgan, dragador. "And Mrs. Dawkins, a housewife." -Yes sir. Come with me. Your friends and co-workers. -Hi, Sparrow. -Look at his new clothes. -Shut your mouth! -Do you know this boy? -I haven't seen him in my life, boss. -But Sparrow, I'm Wheeler. What? -You know me. -You lie. The boy says he knows you and that you know him. -What about you? -I've never seen it in front of you. Do not know him. -This is the first time I've seen him, boss. -Why have they brought me here? -Do not know him. -He's not a friend of mine. Are you sure? -Yes. -Of course. I am Wheeler! Wheeler? Who is Wheeler? -Who is Wheeler? -Who is it? That's all. Take them. Sparrow! But Sparrow was my friend. Why did you say that? Go get it. Ask him again. Sparrow, Sparrow. Go. "Why did you say that, Sparrow?" -Why did you tell on me? I haven't, Sparrow, I swear. -Why did they lock you up? -By entering Windsor Castle. At Windsor Castle! Ask the cops, they'll tell you. I even sat on the throne. -Because you did? -I wanted to see the queen. But they have killed her. -To who? -To the queen. -Who says it? -The murderers killed her. -When? -They say yesterday. -Why did they kill her? -What do you think? Because it is rich. Hooker Morgan says they stole sixty shillings and also jewelery. -How they did it? - Hitting him on the head. What? You lie. I've never seen you. A good group of friends. Do you want to tell me the truth now? Have you seen this, sir? Wheeler in an Irish conspiracy? -Silly stuff! -Are you sure, sir? As far as I can see, there is nothing Irish. Sir, I would instead avoid the Commons for the next few days. Why? If they're innocent, the Irish members will bring it up and they will demand an explanation from the government. -It's natural. -It cannot fail. There are too many feelings, too much speculation In the press. As soon as I step on the Commons they will pounce on you. -Well, well. If His Majesty hadn't been so ... What is it, sir? Poor weak Dizzy. So faithful, so conscientious, so devious. -Do you have any ideas, sir? What was the name of the officer on duty in the throne room? -I think it was McHatten. -I would like to talk with him. -Do you think you can fix it? -I'll take care of it personally. Dearest mom. Please try to understand. Your loving daughter, Emily. -Mr. McHatten? -Yes? -Are you on duty? -Do not. -Can you come with me? -No sir. I have an appointment... The prime minister wishes to see you. -The first Minister? -Yes. -Where is it? -In London. If you accompany me, I have a carriage ready. -Sit down please. -No, thanks. Mr. McHatten, you were present at the first investigation about Wheeler, isn't it? -Yes sir. What opinion did you deserve? You better ask the police. I do not think so. I'm afraid the police are too fair and honest to stand up with the mind of a child. Same with the guards, sir. There would be a decoration if the boy was twenty years older and measure a meter more. Mr. McHatten, I'd like to know what you saw, everything he heard, everything he thought about the boy that night. -I'll try, sir. -Write down all your words. Yes sir. Sir, the question ... Where did you catch that cold? There was a draft in my room. Poor girl. Thanks. I've been worried about you, dear. I have ordered your friend transferred to India, but with a captain's promotion, so that at least he doesn't suffer his military career. I confess that I was not amused. If he's gone, there's nothing more to say. But understand that I cannot speak of the matter lightly. I promise His Majesty that I will not die of lovesickness. You naturally think I'm a nosy old woman that you shouldn't stick your nose in other people's business. Please, Your Majesty, I beg you not to think that. I thought that once, about my mother. She was also in love with a young soldier. Very in love, by the way. But I was a queen, and I was not allowed to fall in love with an officer. I could only fall in love with a prince. I remember thinking that there could not be a prince in the world as good and handsome as that young officer. Now I don't know where he is or what he's doing But then I thought my heart would break And who knows if it wouldn't have been that way if I hadn't known at that precise moment to my cousin Albert? I completely forgot that soldier. Not only was my heart not broken, after a month she couldn't remember exactly what he looked like. -Do you think the same thing will happen to me? -I don't know, I can't say. Despite my behavior, being queen does not make me omniscient. But maybe one day another young man will appear, even more attractive, And then you'll remember it like I remember mine, vaguely. Perhaps, ma'am. Besides, I know you don't want to grieve your mother. Of course not, ma'am. On the other hand, Margaret is a particularly insensitive woman. -Is it, ma'am? -Definitely. And i don't believe either that you go to find another like my dear Albert. Thank you, Your Majesty. It does not matter. Emily! ... it cannot but be disastrous for the economy of this country. -Yes! -Yes! -Mr. Devoy. -Mr. president. The honorable deputy's concern for economic well-being from England reminds me that I would like to express the regret of the people of Ireland ... -Order, order, order! The regret of the people of Ireland for the misfortune that befell them to Her Majesty the Queen, in the case of the child Wheeler, according to the press. But it has reached my incredulous ears that certain vagabonds and scoundrels have started a rumor that this Wheeler I was in the pay of the Irish whose purpose was to assassinate the queen. Order, order! Therefore, I demand that the Queen's Prime Minister present the truth of the case before this House, and that, consequently, make it clear that no Irish have had anything to do with it. Order! The West Dublin MP's request is inadmissible. The question is irrelevant in this debate, which deals with the proposed domestic policy per government recommendations. With all due respect to your post, Mr. President, let me say that the truth of the Wheeler case is so closely linked with the government's proposals that it would not be a change of subject. If the honorable deputies wish it and with the permission of the presidency ... -Yes! -Yes! Sr. Disraeli. First, the government rejects any suspicion of a conspiracy Irish against His Majesty. There is no proof for that presumption. In fact, as far as is known, Wheeler performed only his acts, and must only endure censure and punishment. This may not be the place to discuss behavior of a rogue, but maybe the best place to examine certain aspects of the behavior of this particular rogue, because that is how not only honorable deputies will know it, but the entire nation. I confess that I am as intrigued as anyone for the mystery of young Wheeler. For example, how did we get away? How he managed to turn ten despite what we did to prevent it? Think how hard society went to kill him. Ambushed him at birth, surrounded his cradle with rats and vermin, he released gases down the sewers to poison the air he breathed, tried to poison his mother's milk, but he only managed to poison his mother. She died of typhus before he walked according to police investigations, and since it was not known who the father was, the government obviated the need of a second murder in the same family. Now that he was an orphan, alone, helpless, and totally at the mercy of his country, he went ahead. It attacked her spirit and her soul. I did not teach him anything, he withdrew the word of God, and ended up sending him to the Thames to be a mud boy, barefoot and dressed in rags, victim of cold, humidity and fever. And in the alleys of the docks he was exposed to the worst influences of immorality and evil, and finally, denied him any hope. As a result of that indifference and cruelty, this child developed an unnatural attitude towards England. Unnatural because, despite everything they did to him, it seems that he loves her. So one day he raised his head from the river He looked around, he came out of the mud, and went to see the Queen. Someone had told him that Her Majesty was the mother of England. We all know that expression, but we do not take it at face value. But this illiterate little orphan did. But where could he see her? Walking through the streets of London as the people used to see it? In Green Park where do older children remember seeing her? In any public place where his loyal subjects used to gather to shout his respect and affection for the sovereign? Not anymore. It is impossible for many wasted years. So she must go where her grief has her locked up. The walls of Windsor are tall, but they were no obstacle to Wheeler. They tell me that His Majesty's guards are the best, but he passed them as if they weren't there. And one night came, staining the very throne room with mud, and only for the simplest and most poignant of misfortunes it did not achieve its objective. In the moment of triumph, the boy fell asleep. There are other questions that you can answer yourself. For example, we must consider this little Brit for himself or does he represent all the British kids who are like him? Some in this chamber hold a stern theory, that although the country is overcrowded regarding your food reserves, the correction of this unfortunate situation must be left to the law of survival of the strongest. But excuse me, I've never heard complain about overcrowding in wartime. I don't recall hearing that there were too many Brits in Waterloo. But this is undoubtedly a comforting theory, by which those who hold it may sleep in peace, reassured knowing that the natural law of the jungle will simplify your arithmetic problems. According to this doctrine, Wheeler should not even be alive, much less sitting on the throne of England. Is it, then, an imperfect theory? Wheeler has the right to be alive in open defiance of his patriotic obligation to be dead? He has no regard for mathematicians, whose calculations may turn out to be wrong because of your stubborn disability to die as planned? I, for my part, prefer another solution, based on the sensible concern of the English for their animals. We see the results in any part of the country: in our dogs, our cows, our sheep, horses. It's a shame Wheeler isn't a horse because if it were horses, the British would never allow such a terrifying disability. We go too far when we ask for them to apply these principles to human beings? We are reckless fools trying to level the playing field of the struggle for existence? But the House must not assume that I have risen to defend Wheeler. However, some consider that the true wealth of the country is the british character, and by drawing attention to certain traits of that character which seem to stand out in view of Wheeler's actions, I have only pretended to support the cause of British children, between what Wheeler is only a little bit of our great investment in the future. Nothing I've said alters the fact that Wheeler broke the law and that it deserves punishment, nor should it be assumed that the government entrusts him to the mercy of his country. If I wanted to defend it, I would have used a single argument, that if in this case there was a conspiracy as they claimed, It would not be a conspiracy against the queen, but against the boy. And I would not have appealed to the mercy of this country, but to justice. -Yes! -Yes! The deputies' response was overwhelming. Let Mr. Disraeli know that I want to see him as soon as possible. Yes, Your Majesty. Once upon a time, there was an old woman who lived in a shoe. She spoke as if she were responsible for the child's condition. -They're all his kids, right? -Sometimes you forget who you are, Brown. That is forgetting little when you think of all the little ones of which nobody remembers, the poor children who work in the coal mines, chimney sweeps who drown in the dark, the starving homeless ... -That's enough, Brown! "But they are all your children, madam." -I said enough is enough. Yes ma'am. Mr. Wheeler, I do not mean to tell you that you were not wrong, but we know that there were extenuating circumstances. We have taken measures for their care and schooling to compensate for the negligence we have had with you and as a way of thanking you for the role you have played in our efforts to warn the country on certain issues. -Please accompany Mr. ... -Broom, sir. "To Mr. Broom and Mr. ..." " Didbit, sir." Mr. Didbit. Life is sure to be much more enjoyable for you than in the past. We'll take good care of it, sir. "You will love Devonshire, sir." "Goodbye, Wheeler, and good luck." He is an awake boy, and I would not be surprised if England to hear from you again. -I just wanted to see her, sir. -I know. And I'm so sorry. -Come on, you can't have everything. You are already a very lucky child. Go. You have arrived, sir. -From Windsor? -Yes sir. His Majesty wishes to see you immediately. Mr. Disraeli. Your gracious majesty. You can't imagine how upset I am with you, Mr. Disraeli. Before hearing an explanation? Surely you have prepared all imaginable explanations, but it remains true that he has publicly rebuked the Queen. Excuse me. It may have been a reproach, but not a reprimand. Don't forget that I spoke on behalf of the people with the right to cry out for their Queen. When a child calls his mother, is it a reprimand? When you know you are sick and complain to strangers, it is worse than a reprimand, it is disloyalty. But first, remember that I prohibited the government from mentioning this case? Of that I admit guilty. But I couldn't resist the temptation to strike out for the show. I was confident that His Majesty would find some justification to this disobedience in the effect of my comments in the members of the Chamber. Is that the only thing that matters to you? Another hit? Another victory? Unless my memory fails me more than your Majesty says, his magistrate called for a national reform program, not a worthy failure. I didn't ask for anything at the price of public humiliation. A week ago I made some very intimate confidences to him. I exposed my most secret fears and feelings, I did not hide anything from him. Who would have thought that he would use them in public statements? In an inconceivable rape so brutal and painful? I can't imagine a more misguided and unfortunate interpretation of my actions. What else should I understand when the whole country stood up and used my grief so cold and deliberate How did he deal with the poverty and misfortune of that child? To win sympathy for him, which you needed at that moment, He pointed out to all England my loneliness and my retirement, and offered them as an excuse for what he had done. Not only did he justify it to him, he did it at my expense. Regardless of what he wanted to say, what he said was that. I won't even try to answer that. I will only repeat that I was entrusted with a program of measures for the improvement of His Majesty's subjects. Meeting strong opposition, I believed it was my duty to finish with said opposition with the available means except the dishonest ones. If I don't always abide by the strict standards of the Marquis of Queensberry in such struggles it is because I have been in politics for a long time, And I know there is nothing to be gained from a ballroom dance. But I have succeeded. I have made Her Majesty's program close to victory, when a week ago there were few willing to bet on it. Paraphrasing someone wiser than me, if the method of this achievement is not considered satisfactory, I assure His Majesty that I will not get in the way of his successor. I was not prepared for such an ultimatum, But if our loyalty principles cause you so much conflict, I don't see how I can avoid considering that decision. -That's not the right decision. -Please, Brown. Your husband is dead, ma'am, dead and buried fifteen years ago. The boy is alive. That is the decision you must make, not for him, for you. Who does it serve? The living or the dead? -Get out of the room, Brown. -Not yet. She knew her husband well and I tell him that he would not like this. I think of what he did for the living. They were not his subjects, they were his, but he never stopped thinking about them. I knew they needed help. You are ignorant, Brown. You don't know what you're talking about. Remember the dead in your heart, but save your hand and smile for those who live and they look for a mother. -I can not, I can not. They do not like it. That is irrelevant. It doesn't matter whether they like it or not. She is a queen. And a queen should only remember one rule, a question from the second book of Kings, "is it good for children?" You are still Britannia and they are all your children. -What was that? -I do not know. Wheeler! How do you do it, boy? Are you a little mouse? -Again the same! -For once I'm perplexed. -Get him out of here! - One moment, ma'am. -Take it with you. -Don't you see that he is a harmless child? It does not matter that it is harmless. Take it from my side. All right, ma'am. If Your Majesty overlook the rudeness in the approach of this child, I think that, talking to him, I would understand the devotion felt by at least one of his subjects. Bring him closer. Wheeler, no? Yes ma'am. What is it? Your first or last name? I'm just Wheeler, nothing more. "You are a very naughty boy, Wheeler." -Yes ma'am. Now it is the same as in the portrait. What did you say? As is your portrait. Do you have it on top? I can see? Come on, give it to him. He will return it to you. May I ask where are the Broom folks and that guy ...? Looking for me at Paddington station. Where did you get it? It's mine, I found it. He took it from a sailor, but don't worry, he was dead. -Really? "Mr. Wheeler is an orphan." He seems to have found in His Majesty's face the relief and solace that life denied him. He has no one, madam, he is alone in the world. I'm so sorry, Wheeler. It's the same, you don't have to worry. You have caused us a lot of trouble. It wasn't meant to hurt. Because you did? I don't know, ma'am. Wheeler, why did you do it? I just wanted to see you, ma'am. You're a little mequetrefe, but with as many children as I have hopefully some will come out like this. Sorry Mrs. Nothing happens. I'm not mad at you anymore. Thank Mrs. Thanks to you, Wheeler. Is it all, ma'am? Suppose. Come on son. What do you think they will do to me this time? -Brown ... -Yeah? Take care of him. I will do that. Goodbye, ma'am. Goodbye, Wheeler. Have you already answered those at the hospital? Not yet, ma'am. The most comprehensive of sovereigns.
