SPECIAL EDUCATION Go, go! Don't, folks. You see it's not working. It can't, look. You come and look too. There isn't enough space to pass by. Sit and drive, look how much space you got. Sit in the car and turn the key. You can pass surely. Easily, and it'll be OK. Where is my other shoe? Hey, kid! Did you saw my other shoe? How can someone park the car that way? It's outrageous. - Is that your truck there? - It is. So, is it a proper way to park a truck? That's not your business. - It is our business. - Get out of my way! Look how you parked the truck, idiot, I can't pass! What? Why you staring at me? Who's staring, mom? Stop, Pera! You are caught. Here, comrade. You like to steal more than anything. You'll never get smart, Pera. What's wrong, Shaggy? Call your daddy to set you free. Why are you teasing? Wanna go to station, too? - It's OK, Cane. - It isn't OK. Shut up! I didn't ask you anything. Just let me explain: I didn't do it, it's my brother-in-law. This is not a machine, it's junk. - Pera, what is it with coffee? - This hot plate is working lousy. - Stealing again, huh? - Yeah. - Comrade commander, can I go to bathroom? - Go. Go to piss and be quiet. What's up, Pera? Why are you smoking in the toilet? Because of Cane. He doesn't let me smoke in front of him. Is Cane finished with your report? - He is. - What are you waiting for, then? Go home. Mine is... first, third and last. Let's see. You said: First is zero, third is 5... 5 + 8 = 13. That's right. You are 3. Now me. 3 + 2 + 5 + 6 = 11. So, I'm 1. - Give me 1,000. - Wait, my turn now. Yes, you have to give him rematch. - Give me 1,000, then rematch. - Give it to him Ilija, it's not nice. OK. You got 1,000 if you tell us who's your father. - Will you give me if I say? - Surely. He'll keep the money. Cane. Which Cane? Cane the policeman? - Which other Cane? - Shaggy, say hello to daddy. Fuck yourself, bums. And to mom too! - Twice. - You saw this? I'm taking you to Pera. To get laid from outside. - And give him back in proper condition. - I'll give him back tomorrow. Be careful that those hens don't tousle him. Hey, have you paid the bills? I don't want them to cut my electricity again! Silvio! Watch yourself. Hold on, bigshot. - C'mon, people, "?urnal" starts. - Wait, we don't have a ticket. I got one. Come. - How much? - For you 1,500. - You're expensive. - It's good movie, naked chicks as much as you want. 1,200 then. OK. Run! What a sight, guys. Daddy and son. Where's the light here, for God's sake... Take out tickets. Take them out, I said! All of them! Do you hear me? Don't force me search you. - I must go to bathroom... - Quick! I'll teach you a lesson. Where's the light? RECTOR IN BED Do you want go to dinner at my place? Stop. Here, for your loss. How much you paid the tickets? 10,000. You want to pat me also. This is enough for you. Hi, Rosa. C'mon in. Cheers. What happened? Who knows. Rosa, where is bread? Is she always like this? We got some problems, but that's not your interest. But this is gone beyond limits. - Dinner was great! - Yes, you know a lot. What? You want to ding me like this for the rest of my life? - You want to send me to an early grave? - Why are you shouting? I'm not your slave. You bring here some random bastards. - What you said? - You heard it well. You animal! I can't go further, I can't! Comrade commander, could you stop the car for a second, I'm in need. Now? Why didn't you do it before coming on duty? What? What are you staring at, asshole? Get out! Your traffic permit and driving license, please. - What are you driving? - I drive frozen goods. What we did is not forbidden? Good evening. What happened? Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - I'm coming from Center for social care. Where can I find Petar Antic? Isn't he there? Shaggy! He drifts. A lot. Shaggy? Daddy was looking for you. Pera, open. It's me, Cane. Where have you been Pera, I was looking for you the whole day. Tomorrow you and me go to the courthouse. Why? I don't know, commander said that I aprehand you. Here's Silvije. My Silvije, are those hens tousled you? Oh, my Silvije... Tanasije Antic died of stomach ulcer in 1968. Mother Veroslava Antic, born Ciric, married him reluctantly. This and the fact that she couldn't had children with Tanasije, probably led her to start drinking and having affairs with various men. She changed men every day, so it's very difficult to determine who is Petar's father. We've wanted to take her to psychiatrist, but she refused it categorically. She's currently in investigative prison. As Petar is now alone and left to streets, I agree to suggestion of comrade prosecutor, and I also suggest that we send Petar to one of juvenile corrective institutions to finish school there and prepare for independent living. Bring the accused one. Stand up. Taking all circumstances into account, the Court founds that here accused Antic Petar, made five crimes of petty theft, Article 249 of criminal code, and for another 18 of which there were no physical evidence. But, that's enough already, so the Court is imposing a corrective measure of sending to a corrective institution. Corrective measure will lasts at least 1 year, and maximum 5 years. Sit. Listen... Someone must take him to Belgrade. I think you are the right person. Me? But I've never been in Belgrade. How can we get around here, for God's sake? What' wrong, Cane? Why are you scared? Look at this madness. You don't know who drinks here, and who buys. Pera?! There is Tihi. Go and get autograph for Rosa. Screw him. Catch him! Kid, where's the principal here? They pinched you at the train station, eh? Have you heard what I said, where's the principal? Let him, Cane. We're goin' in. What are you laughing about? What principal? There's no Principal. Enough! What is this? Bad?a! You go immediately at principals's office and tell him what you done. What could I do, Fikret beat me! I don't care, let the principal discuss it with you. Go! You are new. He is. I brought him. Here is court order and judgment. - What is your name? - Antic Petar. Do you have any nickname? You don't have to be shy, you can tell me everything. I'm a psychologist here, tell me. Shaggy. Shaggy? Why Shaggy? OK, we won't insisted if it's unpleasant for you. Sorry. Please. Vinegar? Come over here. You'll take your new friend to principal to check-in, and then you will show him where he will sleep, eat, and do laundry. Will you? - I will. - OK. Come in. - Hi, comrade. - It's not usual for the police to bring us children. You can go now. And be kind, close the door after. Thank you. Petar... Your name is Petar, is it? Let's clear up something. Through this institution have passed many of the children, and very many of them came to the right path. They became normal people, and very good in fact, considering what kind of bums they were. For instance, let's take the case of this... ?utic. Today he's a qualified machine locksmith. And what a thief he was. Vinegar, tell him, please. Yes, comrade principal. He was very dangerous. You are bum too. How many F's you have? Ten? Eight, comrade principal. I didn't take geography yet. That'll save you. Then, tell Petar about Zvonko, what was his nickname? Hiroshima? Last spring Petar, I was his best man. Best man! And what girl he married... Wonderful! Almost goal. Is this drinking water? Leave that water. Drink freely. Drink, so I could twist your neck. Drink, when I say. Drink. Don't lap. Have I told you not to drink, why you do it? You beat the weaker? Hajduk leads 3:0. Good evening. Sorry, colleague, I heard the fuss and decided to drop by. I didn't know that you're there. Good evening. Stay please, this is your group anyway. Muni?aba. (?aba = frog) Pardon? Muni?aba, it's my last name. No problem. Last name is really funy. - Stojanovic. - Pleased to meet. They were totally wild, they haven't had a teacher for 2 months. Sorry, I just arrived today. I just settled in. If you don't mind, I would spend some time with them. What? What you staring at? Go to bed immediately! You are new, am I right? You arrived today? Come with me. Good night. Sit. Sit freely. That thing that happened a while ago, it happens to everyone new. They will get used to you, and vice versa. You passed an entrance exam, sort to speak. There's some pie on the table, if you want, please. It's home-made. It's good we've arrived at the same time. We'll start from scratch. And we should reach something. Sorry colleague, me again. Where's a day room for my group? Next door... ?uti, book in your hands, or I will smash you! Guys, they brought Ljupce here! What, those cops caught him again? - I thought he was fooling around in Italy. - Me too. Is this Milovanovic who's at large for a month? Yes, it's Ljupce. - Who is this one with glasses? - Strahinja. - Excuse me? - Strahinja. House agent. Cop. A beak. A shame on you, Ljupce. This how you repay us? You came here hungry and naked, we provided you everything... ...you could imagine. Everything! And you were running across the border. - From what you've been running? From what? - Tell us. Everyone here were treating you nicely. You couldn't hear an ugly word. If someone said an ugly word, tell us? Colleague, please. He's from your group. But we decided far earlier, that we transfer him to another institution where they treat children a little bit different, sadly. Go and take the bedding. Colleague, please, this thing is resolved. We're through with him. There's nothing for you here. Understand? Please, colleague, let me explain the situation. Boy is new, he's not saying a word from the moment he got here. We tried everything, for instance, I am... - I know? - What is it? What are you staring at? Get lost! - Sorry, colleague. What group is this? Is it mine? - Yes. - Then be kind, don't meddle in my business. Go to day room. Ljupce? You know where is your room. I'm telling you, chick is not bad... She's got hell of an ass. But it dropped low. Although she's receiving nice. She knows the business, eh? She's doing a lot. She's sex machine. Look, a record. - Where did you get it from? - My brother from France sent me. What's it called? The Real McCoy, Van McCoy. Let's listen to it. We haven't got a record player. I know where there's plenty. Where? In one school, they got as much as you want. You can pick. Ljupce. Go with us to steal the record player. Don't be a fool, Ljupce, go with us. You gonna get it for this, Ljupce. Happy Easter, housekeeper. - Fikret, it's you. - It's not me, he is. - Fikret, please come here a second. - Yes, teacher? Listen, you're the oldest here. Finish your game, and take children to a day room. Let them read something. When I get back, you'll show me what is done. Clear? I'm going to the city to buy some things, I'll be back by 7. You have nothing to worry, teacher ?are. Teacher? Sarma was stealing on the station. He took me and Cela... to pastry shop, and Vuna for a drink in a restaurant. If you don't want to hear, I will tell the principal. I'm curious if you actually gonna do this. ?arko went to date with a chick. Are we going to steal the gramophone? - How you know that he's got a date? - How I know? Shit! What am I doing here for 5 years, eh? As he's so tide up, he's going to score. C'mon. Let's play, they are gone. - Put your hand over here. - Don't hit me hard. I won't, I swear. How about we slip in toilet, and wait for the dark, eh? We couldn't get out then. Maybe there's some exit. Maybe we could go through the basement? And a warden? Enough crap, look. Not TH, it's not two vocals. Look at me pronouncing. Sorry, where is that gramophone for repair? Gramophone... look over there. Very good. Once more. This one is totally broken, it needs to go to repair shop. OK, do your job. Once more the whole text from the beginning. Have you been to a disco, bum? - I haven't. - No, really? You know what kind of chicks are there. Boobs like this, short skirts. I'll take you once. - Good morning. - Oh, good morning. How's it going, fellows? You slept well? Sarma? How long since you've been to work? I don't know, less than year. Don't exaggarate. You haven't been just one month. I was speaking with a repairman, he said that he's gonna take you back to work, if... you don't run off anymore. I promised him, and I don't lie. Am I clear enough? Vinegar, how are you? Good. Ljupce? You were goin' to that garage, right? I've talked with repairman Hranislav, too. Get ready to contact him for a job. Will you? Good. And you Pera, you're going with Ljupce. To help him. Oh, it's 6 already, c'mon. Make the beds, quickly. Oh, yes, I forgot to ask you... Where did you get this record player from? My aunt gave me to listen to records. Aunt? Yes, aunt. Good. Alright. If you say so. But I don't advise you to lie to me. Firstly, because I'm rather inconvenient when they lie to me, and second, there are rats among you. You know that? You don't have to worry, teacher Muni?aba. Don't call me Muni?aba, call me ?arko. It's shorter. Is it far from here? Ljupce, does that repairman pay you well? I saw you pissed your bed. Silentologist came. How are you doin' Ljupce, I haven't seen you for ages? Repairman, I'm new. They sent me from correctional house. What is your name? Pera. Come here. Look, you have this emery here, go and do this red Moskvitch outside. When you finish, if you need something, I'll be across the street in that bar. So, I want to ask you something... is that silentologist still quiet, not speaking, eh? C'mon Ljupce, you too. I can't do it all by myself. About housing, well, you gotta be patient. Until society makes a bidding. It's alright, I'm used to living in institutions. You know, we promised you an apartment, and you'll get one. Just be patient. One thing, as for work, how I put this, there's some objections. Well, your colleagues complaining that you work too much on your own, in your own way, that you don't comply with house regulations, that you organize group work in rooms which aren't made for this purpose, you don't consult a psychologist, you don't cooperate with other colleagues... Of course, there are some other objections, but in the meantime our association had some extra money so they printed one of my works. It's more like a brochure, for internal use, you'll read then. It'll be useful. Shaggy, you got a visit. Look who came. Your uncle. You're not happy? Hi, uncle. If you want, you can go to the city. Show Belgrade to your uncle. Alright, teacher. - Bye. - Bye. I said that I'm your uncle. Because of your principal. OK. Let's go. Hey, Corba, come here. Rosa don't like you, I saw that, she got all nervous when she sees you. I don't know what's wrong, sometimes I want to kill her. And then I heard that whole town says that I'm your father. Someone spread the gossip, to send me in an early grave. In addition, Rosa is sensitive when it's about children. She always got those female problems. Where are you take me in this madness? Find some normal place. Let's go to Danube river. Come to eat, look what I made here. Take some bread. Which food those wretches give you, I wonder. C'mon talk, what else is new? Nothing, all the same. Tenants wrote petition because I'm keeping poultry on the terrace, they can spit under my window. I visited a flat, the day before yesterday. Must be a mess there. No. All is as you left it. They haven't released mom yet? What happened? How much she got? Well, I'll tell you nicely... they didn't convict her at all. They released her? She's in treatment, in mental hospital. She went on examination, and doctors found... Wait Cane, you know her. Why didn't you say that she's not crazy? What could I do, Pera? Doctors came and transfered her directly from prison to... ...the asylym. To that hospital close to Ni?. Want more? Sorry colleague, for bothering you but I must speak with you urgently. - Please. - It's about your protege Ljupce. As the meeting of professional collegium is tomorrow, I came to find out is it you arranged with language teacher that a boy should take the written exam. - I am. - What's your right to determine therapy? Do you know why this boy doesn't speak? Do you know that he witnessed a murder of his own mother, and that I implement one therapy for years which you've nullified with one act? I know. I know everything. - I read the files. - Yes... - Excuse me. Then, why did you freely, not to say arrogantly, after just a few months spent in one institution, ruin everything that people have achieved for years. Do you know that you and me, social workers and principal, that we are one team who work together, and that you haven't got the right act on your own. Like children are your private property. - Kosara, sit. - I don't want to sit! You stand then. And about Ljupce, from what I read in those files and time spent in this institution, I think that boys' silence represents protest against the environment he lives in. - It's not true! - Please, let me finish. As you know, boy never stole anything. He's here only because there's no center for social care in his hometown, and because people just didn't know what to do with him. It's not true. It is not true, because you are incompetent to say that. You got no knowledge or right to bring those conclusions. Yes, but I got experience. I work in institutions for 15 years. This is my fourth. That experience give me the right to struggle to help children. Experience doesn't mean anything. People deal with science which name is psychology. I could say you what you can do with that science. But if you don't want to help someone, than the Academy of sciences won't help you. Boy got here without any reason. He's not psychotic, and my task as a teacher, is to help him to get back to normal living. He represents a key of my work with the whole group. If I succeed with him, I'll succeed with everyone. Alright, you taking a risk on yourself. Just for your information, I will bring this out tomorrow at the professional collegium. Of course I'm taking a risk. I took a risk the same moment I started doing this job. And please, remember: Ljupce is my problem from now on, not yours. Take it. No thanks. Don't, Ljupce! I was sitting there accidentally! I wanted to be alone 'cause they took my mom to an asylym! I've said to you without any doubt, colleague Muni?aba, that we wouldn't tolerate here a private attitude towards work. Have I said it? We're a community here, which fullfil the plan and program the way society defined it. Where did you get an idea not to check the origin of things found with your proteges? It's my method. Which method is that? Which method is that, when you turn your back on an obviously stolen thing and pretend to be uninformed. Say, which method is that? What are we? Supermarket or a home for neglected children? Teacher, look how Vinegar made a light-show. It's like a disco, right? Vinegar, turn it off! Pack this and take it to principal's office. Fikret's aunt came to take the gramophone. And you kid... Why aren't you at work? Where is Ljupce? I don't know, teacher. He's gone and I don't know how to get there alone. Why not? Where is Ljupce? He's in classroom, reading. What's he doing? He reads. Why we gotta go to work, and he reads? You fucked up because of aunt, Fikret. Have I said to be quiet, you wouldn't listen to me? Pera? Are you hungry? - I am. - Wanna eat? Yes, teacher, but look at this. It's really not-so-good, but there's a way to solve this. Protesting is not the way. Let the ones who want to eat, and others can put back a tray and go to sleep. I'll speak with the cook later. Silence! Sarma. - You were in charge of keeping the order. - It's 300 of them. What can I do? Go and wait for me in front of the office. Go and wait for me in front of the office. Have you decided? Wanna eat? You too wait for me in front of the office. Have you tasted what you're giving to children? I'm giving what I got, and you give them something else if you have. Go and buy some cheese, ham, whatever. Now, fix all this mess and collect dishes, if you don't want your friends to suffer. I'll be back in 10 minutes. All must shine. Clear? Sarma, go and supervise cleaning of kitchen. I will be back in 10 minutes. - What can I do... - Don't talk, but go! And watch that they don't rage again. Listen, Pera. Listen. You and me came to the same house to live there for a while. It's certain for you, you will stay 4 years by assessment, but it's not certain for me... And it doesn't matter. I didn't come here to educate. Do you understand? Neither did you. To be educated. We're standing in front of a problem here, which we got to solve together. We started from scratch, right? We started from scratch, and we gotta get somewhere. That somewhere got no name. Got no name. There's only a thought that we are on different sides of baricade. Of some abyss. And that we need to be together tomorrow. I can help you, if you want. If you don't, then you're staying on the other side of abyss and... there's no help for you. If I want to help you, you must help me too. You must help me too. Understand? - Teacher? - Yes? Have you been drinking a shampoo? Stop! Get out, quick! Get in! They were caught during the theft on the tram. Sign here. What are you smiling about? What's funny? Ringleader. Sarma? Bring the shearing machine. Sit. You wanna fight, eh? C'mon. C'mon, c'mon. Turn it on. Give it to me. - Move. - He'll be like Kojak. You're smiling, eh? Why are you crying? This is only the beginning. - Repairman? - What? Some woman came and said that you go out if you can. What she wants? She smashed her car a bit, and now doesn't dare to tell her husband. - Is it smashed bad? - No, just a little bit on wing and stop light. OK. Start working. Paganini? Let's drive for a while? Boss will not return before dark, anyway. Just one round! C'mon, Ljupce. Stop! Brake. Are you goin' towards New Belgrade? Great, there's no bus for an hour. Is this your car? His. They're cool. New Mercedes, eh? Why don't you turn a radio on? This is cool turning, I could say. - Well... Thanks. - Don't mention it. - Are you living, here? - Yes, that window there, on the 1st floor. Is your friend kind of angry with me? No, no, he's not... He's got a headache, so he's pissed off. I thought that something's wrong. - OK, thanks again, goodbye. - Bye. Ljupce, look how she's hot. Let's arrange something, eh? Wanna meet again? To fool around a bit? Alright. I'm Mira, drop by when you're around. We'll surely do. Hey, Mira? Do you have a girl friend? We got chicks, drive. Ljupce will talk, I'm telling you. I saw all those generations... - Here's Pera! My little sweetheart... - Where is Ljupce? Here in front of bar. C'mon, sit. Where you've been? - With some girls. - With girls? - Where did you get girls? - They were hitch-hiking. And Ljupce? How was he? Did he talk? No, he was quiet, but... - He was pleased. - Really? Oh, I forgot to tell you. Some Cane called today and told me he discovered that you set him up ...with some intrigue. What intrigue? I don't know. What else he said? Nothing, only that he's gonna come on sunday to visit he's wife in hospital. Who's that Cane? No one, some uncle. Here, bananas and oranges. How are you, aunt Rosa? Now it's alright. It's important that operation succeeded. It won't be anything of me. Don't, Rosa, please. It's gonna be alright. Child brought me oranges. And I abused him so much. Don't be mad with aunt Rosa. - Why would I be mad? - Why she's got to be mad? You set me up with that intrigue in town. Which intrigue? Which one? You know very well. Shame on you. I didn't say that way... You know that they want to retire me? Because I got no retraining. Now those young and educated from Academy are coming, they speak languages. Why they need languages? Like that's gonna... It's not just that. I can't even live with my salary, and with retirement I can't pay for this retraining. That's it, when everything goes bad... He's new one, see? Look how much hair he got. Just look at him. I wouldn't give him a time of day. Cane, there's some free seats here! Where? What is it? C'mon, Cane, you'll give me when you got it. I will spend it anyway. - Pera, are you crazy? - It's better that you have it. Bye, Pera. Mira? Mira! C'mon, we're frozen. Come out. - Did you bring the car? - No, Ljupce drove it to service. They're coming. There will be something for me too. - Hi, there. This is Violeta, and this is... - Pera and Ljupce. Do you know how to drive Peugeot? Just be careful that my parents don't find out, park the car in the same place. Violeta is quiet like your friend. You must force them to talk. C'mon Violeta, say something. - It doesn't matter, you and me will talk. - Alright. Look at this burgundy hat over there. I must have it promptly. It's nice. 2,800. 3,000. I got an idea. We're goin' out of town. OK? Violeta? C'mon. You're quiet all the time, then right in front of a motel, eh? You are not naive, are you? There is ?arko. Look, Frog's with a girl. Bend over. - Who's that? - Some of our friends. Violeta, let's walk for a while. And then Ljupce and Mira stayed in the car, and I went out for a walk with the other one, Violeta. Why? Because they were kissing on the mouth. With tongue. Really? - Yes, and Ljupce touched her breasts, I saw it. - And you? I didn't nothing. That mine, Violeta is... not so hot, like a board. We were walking, and came back later. Then Ljupce and me gave them a ride home. We parked the car in the same place, so Mira's father doesn't notice. Will you meet again? We will. On saturday, Mira's parents are going somewhere on picnic, so Mira will throw a party. She invited you? Yes, but she's got some company... What's your concern? They'll like you. Tell me, did Ljupce say something? He didn't. Did you go on a date with girl? How did you know I have a girlfriend? I don't know, but... you dressed up nice. I ain't got her anymore. She left me. Bye! Hey folks, Frog's got dumped! Where did you come from? I was on duty, so I used your invitation for a coffee. Welcome. I was thinking, colleague, about the so-called fight we had. And I think, that you're right about one thing, about the fact that this enviroment bothers Ljupce. I changed my opinion about it. I went yesterday to "Centroprom", and I talked there with the manager who agreed to take Ljupce to work in a garage. - Repairman Hranislav really isn't... - Kosara. It isn't about repairman Hranislav. You can't return someone's faith in people, who's deeply hurt, by sending him from garage to garage. I got the feeling that Ljupce is returning to the world he was running away from. I think it's better for him to stay where he is, at least for a while. You know what? There's a term in psychology "paranoid on duty". Well, I think that you are the obvious example. Go. C'mon, carefully. - What are you doing? - I'm diggin', comrade principal. Out. Look. Be very careful. Sarma, where did you find that coat? Vuna gave me. If I was a chick, I'd give it to you immediately. I know you'd give me. Where are you goin'? I'm going to the city. Teacher let me. Which teacher? - Teacher ?arko. - ?arko? Alright. Go. Comrade principal? What will happen to the palm when the snow falls? Get lost, bum! Kristina, where did you find that scum? I'll tell to your mom, that thieves are consuming you. Throw that that away, you hen. - Honey, wait a second while I fix those assholes. - Don't, please. Don't worry, I'll be back in a moment. Wait for me. What's up, punks? Well? They're beating on Sarma! They beat Sarma. - What happened? - They're beating Sarma. - Where? - I don't know. Get lost! Back to the house! What time is it, Fikret? - 4:15 PM. - 4:15 PM? And where you should be at this time? Do you hear me? In a day room, doing free activities. Instead being in a day room, you're walking around, and looking to slaughter something by the way. Right? Where did you get that watch? From aunt? - Do you have a receipt? - No. Come here. - You... - What are you doing, man? Who allowed you to beat proteges? You go and plant your palm tree. And you... Shame on you! You're attack peaceful citizens. - Those are all bums... - What will these people think about us? C'mon! Be quiet, and go. Everyone to the rooms. - Muni?aba? - Yes? Frog! ?arko! You drink shampoo, eh? Hey, teacher! Good evening. This is my mom and dad, this is my boyfriend Ljupce and Pera. Pera Shaggy, nice to meet you. Pera Shaggy. Pera Shaggy. Pera Shaggy. Hi, Violeta. Kids, what are you drinking? I got amaro, whiskey, brandy, Coca-Cola? Beer. Ljupce? Two beers. What school are you at? He finished school and works. He's got auto repair shop. I'm going to gymnasium in Zemun. What repair shop have you got? Kids, why don't you serve yourself? There's food in the kitchen for two days. Mira, do you have "Alija Sevdalija" by Hoki? "Alija Sevdalija"? No. Ljupce, did you came by car? No. He sold it. He's buying a new one. Pera... Stop the bullshit. What's wrong? Nothing. I got no repair shop, no car, nothing. We're from the institution. Which institution? From correctional institution. There we are... the ones who steal. Thieves, crooks. C'mon, Pera. Wait... Wait, stop. Where are you goin', Ljupce? He never stole anything, I swear. You're going? Why are you in a hurry? Hey, Violeta, what's up? How is it going? What you're doing? Do you know why people call me Shaggy? When I was a kid, my mom always used to bring some guys in our house. I didn't know what they were doin' there in a room, and then, one day I droped in, and I saw one guy riding my mom. I asked them: "What are you two doin' here?" They said: "We're shaggin', don't you see?" And, then kids from my street asked me "What's your mom's doing with that guy?" I said: "She's shaggin'." Then, kids started to call me Shag, Shaggy and... that nickname stuck. Why are you silent? Say something. That repairman got drunk, and went totally crazy. ?arko asked me about yesterday's party. I told him that you screwed Mira. And I said that I got to petting with Violeta. And that you spoke. - What did you say? - All this. Then he gave me money for cinema. Please. That repairman Hranislav got drunk, he wants to ruin my bar. Please. Boss got drunk like batten. Let me go! Who's gonna educate those two kids? Don't, people! What's wrong, he never got drunk like this before? Where are they now? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I don't know. They don't tell you anything about the money? Sorry I'm interrupting you. Have this boy attended your daughter's party? He wasn't. There was a smaller and a taller one. But this boy wasn't. Then, why are we bothering him? Vinegar, go to your room. Easy. Easy, colleague. It's not easy. When is about my children I'm the boss. Vinegar, go to your room. You'll allow me, if it's about theft, I got some rights. Strahinja, I want to remind you, this is about that case... How much money... Sorry, comrade principal, just to ask gentleman something. - How much is missing? - 500 german marks and 200,000 dinars. And you keep all that money at home? That money we drawn from the foreign currency savings, because we've planned to go to Trieste next week. Is it possible that this money could get stolen by someone else, someone who maybe came to your house too? - No one. - Only Sofija. Oh yes, it's our housekeeper, but... she came next morning after we found that money is missing. You see, then. Listen, I surely know that my proteges didn't steal that money. - What do you mean you 'surely' know? - It's simple. They told me. Where you wanna go? To my place. I got room. They'll find us there right away. So what? We're gonna cram on the attic, until they find out who stole the money. My man has got a key. You have to see the principal, he shit in his pants! Look out. Ljupce said something. So what? Nothing. Why are you running if you hadn't stolen the money? Why not. Until they figure out who did, we'll go to jail. Who could it be? Get in, what are you waiting for? Can I go with you? What am I gonna do there? We don't need you for shit? - Bye, Vinegar. - Bye, so long. - What? - Some jerks. I don't want them to recognize me. Now right. Stop here. What is this, where's my home? Hey, bro. When did they tear down this? A month ago. What about us who lived there? I don't know, I'm only a hired hand. You know what then... They teared my house down. Let's go to Cane, to see what we're gonna do. Fuck. Here. - You want something strong? - I can't, Rosa. As soon as I saw them tearing down, I went to municipality and said to them that they gotta give you an apartment. And I arranged it. Later I'll show you, you got perfect one with two rooms. Where is it? There in the park. You know, those new high rises. How long are you're stayin'? I'm going right away. I'm here with some friend. Pera... Do you know that everything is allright? What is? That thing. She's pregnant. She haven't had it for a month. Month and a half! What? Period, you know. Looks like I'll finally become a father. What I wanted to ask you... What we were talking about? You see the first floor there? Imagine 12 more above. There's yours, on the 13th floor. Good, eh? What happened with your retirement? It's not retirement, but retraining. I will be working on forms, replacing driving's licenses. Not bad, eh? Second thing, our football club entered first league, and there'll be a match in every second week. Stewardship! There's gonna be some cash, no troubles at all. To give you your money back. What money? One from the station. Don't, please! Pera, debt is debt. Take it! In a moment! - Bye, Cane! - Bye. - Want to drop you off down there? - No, I want to round the area. Have a nice trip, and wherever you go, be welcome! Are we going back to institution? What can they do, I'll say Mira that we didn't steal the money. Where we'll go to? C'mon. Don't drive so fast! We'll crash somewhere! Are you crazy? Ljupce, don't be a fool, police will catch us, then we'll be fucked up! Stop, Ljupce! Stop the car! Brake, I don't want to go with you! - Get out! - Why? Get out! Get out! Why are you pushing me? I taught you how to speak, you mute asshole! Get lost! I got you chicks, you mute horse! Over here. Wait here. Oh, yeah... About that money, it's found. Girl took it and brought back. What girl? Their daughter. She returned the money, the same evening parents came to our house. So, it's suspended. What is suspended? It. The kid is clean. And what about the death of my protege? Nothing is suspended. You're going?
