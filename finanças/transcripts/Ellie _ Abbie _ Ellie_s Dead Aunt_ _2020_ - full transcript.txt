Huh, Randall's just posted a video on Facebook asking Sophia to the formal. Oh, my God! I definitely asked for almond milk and he got me soy. I felt like it was deliberate. You know those people who make fun of you because you drink almond milk? It's not my fault I'm lactose intolerant. You know, I say to him I want something, but I don't really mean it and he just goes off and... and does what I say when actually I'm saying the opposite. Do you know what I mean? But I can't get rid of him 'cause they've got too many rights, don't they? Workplace... Darling, you're making that much worse. Here. Mum, stop hovering! Well, what is this for? I'm asking a girl in my class to the formal. Hooray. That's... I'm gay. Mum? You're such a bigot! I go beyond other people's fears and limitations. I claim my power and move beyond all limits. That went really well. Look, if anyone should be upset, it's me. How would you feel if your own niece didn't recognise you? How would you feel if a strange woman showed up in your bathroom claiming to be your dead aunt? Well, I wouldn't have hid in the shower. The door was right there. No matter what I do with her right now, I just can't win. You know I listened to a podcast about this... You should probably go check on your mum. She's been ranting for, like, an hour now. Oh, classic Mum. I'm in the bathroom with a stranger and she's out there having a secret cigarette, worrying about herself. I am so upset and now I'm smoking, which I would never normally do. Brutal! Actually, why don't you go and scare her? I'm sure she'd love to see you. Yeah, it doesn't really work like that. - How does it work? - Oh, God, I'm sorry! I can't believe I forgot to do this. Congratulations on coming out. I am Tara, your fairy godmother. Get it? Fairy, gay, fair... Get it? Fairy's gay. Gay fair... Anyway, so coming out is hard and I have been sent here to help you through it. Let's bring it in. Come on. There you go. Come to Aunty T. There we go, there we go. Cool, I get it. Yeah, not yet. We just... A fist bump? No. No! Hello! So I take it not everyone who comes out gets a fairy godmother? No, only those who are lucky enough to have a gay relative who died before they were born and never got to pass on their wisdom. So, for example, if you had a gay uncle, or a 'guncle', or in this case a lesbian aunt, or a 'lesagna'... Um, OK, well, please don't take this the wrong way, but I just don't think that... Look, it get it. This is a really scary time for you. I'm not scared. I'm fine. There's, like, five other gay kids in my year, so it's not really that big of a deal. I get it. It's different to when you were alive. But I don't really think that there's anything you could do to help. OK, sweet Ellie. Yeah, sure. So, um, let's just talk about today, then, shall we? You were there for that? Oh, I've been there since the beginning. The assignment on Australian politicians? Spew town! Wait. Where were you? Right here! Of course, you couldn't see me then. Hey, I'll type these up all ready for tomorrow. Thanks. See ya. And there it was, the moment you realised you were gay. I couldn't interfere until you actually said the words out loud... ..which luckily you did before you had a chance to go through with this. What on earth were you thinking? I'm gonna make a video, post it to my Facebook page. OK, I don't know what that is, but it sounds terrifying. All the straight kids in my class are doing it. If the straight kids were gonna jump off a bridge, would you... Never mind. What if she doesn't wanna go with you? What if she doesn't like girls? She does. I think. Someone told me that she does. - Have you spoken to her? - Of course. No, not about George Reid, the fourth prime minister of Australia. Sometimes if you want something, you just have to put it out into the universe and it will happen. - Forget it. - Look. Let me help you with this. Just give me one shot. That's all I ask. That, and that you don't post anything. I guarantee you I give better advice than a planet. If she had just stayed for a second longer, I would've apologised, but she'd much rather blame me. You know, it's just about grandchildren. - What? - Your mum. Yeah, I figured that probably had something to do with it. So go out there, tell her you'll have a grandchild and she'll be fine. No. OK. Heads! Sorry! It's fine. Not in public, not in public, not in public! It's alright! I'll talk, you listen. I feel like I'm in a crime podcast. - What's that? - What do you want? My shot! Look, if this works, you have to let me help you. Deal? "Yes, Tara, deal!" So first things first - we need to find out if she's into girls. Luckily, I have a fail-safe technique I used to use to find if a girl played for the same team. Ugh, what? Ask her who her favourite AFL player is. If she knows any, there's your answer right there. That's such crap. I'm just saying. You'd be surprised. I have to find the right time to talk to her. She's in afternoon detention all week. For a week? Into bad girls, are you? I'd like to pretend you never said that. Yeah, me too. Detention, huh? I mean, if it were me... School captain in detention, hey? - Yep. - What did you do? Oh, you know... No, that's why I'm asking. Littering. Really? Yeah, apparently it's a pretty big offence these days. Yeah, it is. It's pretty fucked, actually. I mean, there's, like, 50 bins in the schoolyard and you couldn't be bothered to take the five steps and put your rubbish in one of them? Sorry, I just feel pretty strongly about it. That's OK. It ends up in the ocean, birds eat it and stuff. No, you're right. You make an excellent point. Actually, didn't you lead that assembly on the environment? Like, tell everyone to take three pieces of rubbish with them? Yeah, yeah, that was... that was me. Ah, the irony. What did you do? I, um... I dropped a C-bomb in the principal's office. - By accident? - No, to his face. How come? Being one. Right, yeah, I totally think he's one of those as well. Really? I actually think he's pretty great. We were just having a heated debate. I got angry. Like, he deserved it, but I'll never call him that again. - You know? - Yeah, totally. Anyway... Yeah, totally. Hey, um, I wonder... I wonder when we'll find out what we got for that assignment. It was interesting. We had so much to work with. Wait, are you talking about the guy who almost passed that referendum and then didn't? Yeah, I mean, I guess I find it really interesting when men almost do something and then... don't. Hey, I tell you what. The, um... the assignment I'm doing for history this time is really grim. It's about a woman who was killed just for standing up for what she believed in. - Does sound grim. - But I love that stuff. I'm so invested in it. Like, I can't stop reading about it and researching it. It's like... it's like watching a car crash. You know, you just can't look away. - Who you doing? - Faith Underwood. Is she the one who does, like, the affirmations and stuff? Yeah, I think she's amazing. There's a whole science behind it. It's not just spiritual. I don't really understand it, but I do her affirmations and they truly helped me get school captain and good grades and stuff. You don't think that's because you're, like, really smart and nice and you study hard? No. Are you into AFL at all? Yeah. Who's your favourite player? Roger Federer. He's a very famous tennis player. Is that so? Ellie, is that you? Miss Trimble. Yes, uh, hi. Hi. What are you doing in detention? It's not a social club, you know. I know. I'm... I'm actually in detention today. What? Oh! Uh, oh. Um... No, no. Uh, no. No. I've got three names on my list and there's four people in detention. - You're not on the list. - Are you sure? Yes. Oh, dammit. No, you're not on the list. You're absolutely not in detention. Oh, well, I... I must have misunderstood, then. I can't imagine how that's happened, but it seems that is the case. - So come along, get out. - Yeah, what a mix-up. You almost gave poor Miss Trimble a stroke. Yep. I mean, it almost seems like you were pretending. That's dumb. Uh, I'll see you later... or not. I hope you were... ..'cause I could never be into someone who littered. So... OK, cool. Well, I'll see you later. And then she called me a bigot, my own daughter. I mean, she's never said anything like that to me before. I don't even know where she learned that word. Well, it gets thrown around a lot these days. Yeah, well, you should've seen the look in her eyes. Yeah, she doesn't mean it. She's just upset... Are you crazy? Don't smoke in my car! She just took me by surprise. That's all. I mean, I don't... It doesn't bother me if she's, you know... It was just a bit of a shock. I mean, I just want what's best for her. I want life to be easy for her. Well, that's impossible. But that doesn't mean that I don't love her regardless or respect her choices. Yeah, maybe don't say 'choices'. And now I'm smoking, which I would never normally do. Is that an Uber job? We can pick them up on the way home. I don't mind. That is not at all how it works. I mean, she's my only daughter! - I know. - My only child. I know. What about grandchildren? I'm not gonna get any grandchildren. Oh, come on. Shut up! You know that's not true. Anyway, I don't have grandchildren and I have a wonderful life. Grandkids are just parenting again except with a sore back. Fuck. I'm being so rude. I have no self-awareness sometimes. Here you are, sitting with me while I basically insult your life. Yes. You have always been a terrible friend. You're this smart, brilliant woman who's done more with her life than I could possibly hope for and here I am crying because my daughter has a crush on some girl. What's wrong with me? Hi, darling. You should pick that up, Mum. It's littering. Are you gonna tell me what all this was about? - Aunt Patty? - Yes, darling. Why do you put up with her? - It means she hates you too. - She doesn't hate me. Don't feel you have to answer that question. And don't you keep avoiding my question. What has gotten into you? Where as my sweet daughter gone? I mean, you're like a different person and all I can seem to think is it must be that... OK, let's not say anything that we might regret. It must be that girl. I'll walk home, thanks. Don't. Just... don't. Oh, yeah! What did I tell you? To be fair, I'm not sure how much you actually helped. I just have one little criticism. You didn't ask her to the freakin' formal! - It didn't come up. - Ohh! That was your chance! The momentum was there. It's OK. I'll just ask her tomorrow. I feel like it'll be easier now. Well, that's because you've never had a follow-up conversation before. - What? - The follow-up. You know, the first time that you see each other after a first date, a first kiss or first-time admission of feelings. Follow-up conversations are remarkably awkward, no matter how comfortable you were the day before. That's not a thing anymore. I think you're wrong. We have this thing now called texting. Abolishing the awkward follow-up conversation forever. I'll just text her. It's one of the great things about being a millennial. What's that? So I'm assuming texting is you just staring at that thing? Shh, I'm concentrating! Would you say that 'great' is too strong of a word to use? No. - I feel like it is. - Can you use it in a sentence? "It was great to see you today." You're right. Too strong. Take it out. Yeah. What a simpler time you live in. Actually, I think I'll just talk to her tomorrow. I prefer face to face anyway. Mm-hm. Anyway, I should probably be heading home. I meant what I said about us talking in public. It's too easy to forget that you're a ghost. I'm not a ghost! I'm your fairy godmother. La! But I do agree that you should go home and talk with your mum. Are you kidding? - Are you on her side too? - No! I thought you came back from the dead to help me. I did. I did! You of all people should be appalled by her behaviour. What is it with you old gays and your tolerance? Hey, I'm 28! First Aunt Patty, now you. Huh? Aunt Patty? Wait. You have another aunt? No, Patty's just an old friend of Mum's. They were lawyers together or something. But Patty's retired now. I just call her Aunt Patty because I love her and she's the best. Patty? Is that short for Patricia? Of course. What else would it be? Well, it could be for, like, Patrice or... Patches. No, but if it would make you feel better, I can ask her if her name is short for Patches. It must be hard. Being dead. No. It's just... nothing. Mum never talks about you. Well, it was a long time ago and a lot has happened since then, so... Not really. Just me. Well, you're a pretty big thing. Big hair, big limbs, big personality. I would've given anything for your hair. Your mum had it once. So your mum has never told you about how... You died? Car accident. Oh. - Did you not know that? - No. I don't remember much, really. Just your mum. Everything else is pretty vague. Well, I should probably actually get going. Hey. Sorry to just bring up your death and then leave. It's fine. I asked. Oh! Ellie! What are you doing? I... I wanted to talk to you. Oh, good, I... 'Cause I wanted to talk to you too about, um... all of this. - 'This'? - Oh, God. Give me a break. I'm doing my best. OK. Oh, this is ridiculous! We used to... we used to talk about everything. You're my best friend. I thought Patty was your best friend. Well, she's my second best friend. No, she's my second best friend. - And who's your best friend? - You. Right? But you don't wanna talk about this? I do, but you... you just keep yelling at me. - I'm not yelling at you now! - Well, you are, actually. Well, that's 'cause you're not being supportive. Well, I am trying, but you're making it very difficult. Oh, well, I'm sorry it's so difficult to love me! This is ridiculous... No! No. I'm not handling this new 'storming out' thing. So just feel free to leave, but, please, just no... storming. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - What? - Go away! I forgot to give you my next piece of advice and it looks like I am just in time. I said you could help once, OK? That's it. Now I've got this, OK? - Go away. - I must have missed that. Anyway, here is a list of conversation topics to prevent the awkward follow-up conversation. "Who do you prefer, "k.d. lang or Melissa Etheridge?" Oh, my God. You're making this a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's just two people having a conversation. It's not a special gay conversation. Fine! If you don't need my help, just go talk to her, then. Go on. Just pretend like I'm not here. I'm basically not anyway, physically or emotionally. Oops! That stint in detention clearly taught you nothing. What you doing, school captain? Nothing. Just going to class. - Oh, it's... it's lunch. - Yep. - How's your day going? - You too! You OK? You seem a bit on edge. - What you got there? - Which? - The book. - Oh, this? It's my journal. Sometimes I like to just sit here and watch everyone socialising on the playground, like, finding their friends, you know, some of which they may have for the rest of their lives. Like... OK, these two girls here, right? They just look like any other pair of friends. But think about it. That could be her future bridesmaid or... or the one she calls when her first child's born or the person she calls in tears when her husband leaves her. I just think it's so interesting to see these things from the very beginning, you know? Wow. Really? No, of course not! It's my fucking science textbook. Oh, man, that was good, though. You were very convincing. For a second, I was like, "What?!" I bet you were thinking, "Why'd I follow "this chick into detention?" - Yeah, exactly. - Totally. - Ah, so you admit it, then? - What? About detention? No. So, um, what did you do last night? Nothing. Just worked on my assignment. Oh, yeah? How's it going? You know we have to present them to the whole class? Yeah, but only 'cause Miss Trimble kept saying "oral exam" and I kept laughing. I'm sorry. I'm not actually proud of that. No, I love oral sex jokes. So I was actually gonna message you last night. - You were? - Mm. Why didn't you? If I'm being honest, I just didn't know what to say, so I guess I just didn't message you. That's silly. I know, 'cause I wanted to, so it's just dumb that I didn't. Well, next time, you should. Alright. Yep. I'm going to the bin. Oh, that's OK. I'll... I'll chuck it. No, I'm sure you will chuck it. That's the problem. I'm seriously starting to worry about you and your littering habit. Thank you. - Actually, um... - What? - What is on this note? - Nothing. 'Cause you seem to not want me to have it, but you were perfectly happy just to chuck it on the ground over there. - It's just... - Maybe... Maybe I should read it so you fully understand the consequences of your littering. - No! It's... You can't... - What? What? It's really important you don't see what's on that note! Give it back! Don't be such a cunt! Oh! Nope. Is everyone OK? I cannot believe you called me that. I mean, there are many acceptable things that I deserve, but not that. That's debatable. I'm really sorry if I upset you. I just genuinely didn't think there could be anything important on that note. It's fine. You don't really strike me as the swearing type. I'm not. I hate swearing. Right. So I guess for you to say... ..that word it must've been something really personal. Hey, I'm sorry. Thanks. Right. Well, I have discussed this with the principal and, amazingly, he's decided this will not affect your position as school captain due to your almost perfect record. But we have called your mother. - Ugh, that is so much worse. - Yes. Well, maybe that will make you think twice before you call a classmate... that word... ..over a list of conversation topics. And for what it's worth, I would always choose k.d. lang over Melissa Etheridge. As would the principal. And as for you, Miss Abbie, you've only got a couple of detention days left, so let's not add to them by taking other students' property, OK? Of course, miss. A list of conversation topics? Ellie, you can always just, like... I don't understand why you're trying so hard. OK, no, that came out wrong. Ellie? Ellie, you can't just leave detention! That's, like, the point of... detention. Ah, yes, did she send you to deal with me, one lesbian to another? Well, those weren't her exact words. Are in the middle of a food delivery? Uh, yeah, we're gonna have to make a stop, sorry. That's modern retirement for you, babe. You might not be at that age yet where you realise your parents are just human. Flawed, everyday humans. Do you remember Daniel Claris? Of course, that sweet little boy who sent you flowers to your classroom. It was the first year of high school. All the girls in my grade were so jealous. I was so embarrassed to carry them home. And when I got home, you and Mum gave me so much grief. Those flowers were bigger than your little body! "Ooh, Daniel, Daniel! "What does Daniel look like? What does Daniel like doing? "Is he blond? Does he have brown eyes? "Ooh, I hope he has brown eyes." I know. We were so mean. Oh, you were so upset, you poor little thing. She hasn't teased me about her. She hasn't asked me what she looks like. She hasn't even asked me what her name is. Oh, El. "Faith Underwood is a disruptor. "Five years ago, she crashed into the digital space "with a program bringing the laws of the universe "to a new generation. "Faith spent five years in the foster care system "before building her empire." Wait for shocked reactions. "That's right. "I think we've all learned not to judge a book by its cover." Ooh-ooh! That is an interesting plot twist. - Stop doing that! - Oh, sorry. I don't mean to interrupt. I just wanted to stop in and check that you were OK. What, after your stupid list got me in detention? Not to mention completely humiliated? - OK, in hindsight... - No hindsight. Foresight could've told anyone that you showing up at my school was a stupid idea. Yes, I can now see where you may have got that idea from, sorry. Will you please just go away? I have so much homework. And I don't wanna think about anything else. Sure. Yeah, OK, I'll go. I'm sorry. I just... Look, just remember, if you need me, I'm here. Need you? All you have done since you got here is make everything worse. I was fine. I was excited about what I was feeling and just asking the person I liked to the formal, and... and now I hate how I feel. I feel anxious all the time and I'm second-guessing everything and I feel like I'm making everything harder than it needs to be. What is the point of you? What do you want from me? All you have done is make me feel different. Yes! Uh, not yes, but that is exactly the point. I'm not different, OK? I realise that life was probably really hard for you growing up and maybe you were different and maybe you were a freak. But I'm not, OK? I'm just like everyone else. Of course you are just like everyone else, El. But you are also different, and different is wonderful. - Stop saying that! - El... Shut up! I'm just like everyone else, OK? Shut up! Just... just go away, OK? I just think it's for the best. I need to go through this stuff on my own. OK. Hey. - Hi. - What you doing? Just going over my assignment. - Cool. - You ready to do yours? Yeah, yeah. So, um... so, actually, I messaged you last night. I know, um... Actually, I messaged you many times. - I know. Yeah. - Bit rude. Especially considering you specifically asked me to message you. Yes. Look, I just wanna preface this upfront - I have absolutely no interest in being messed around. I know. I'm... I'm sorry. I know it wasn't cool of me not to reply. I just had to do all my homework and there was a lot happening at home and... - Alright. - Wait, no, stop. OK. I think I just had a bit of a freak-out. In the last three days, I've been in detention twice, I've been fighting with my mum for the first time ever, I've been dealing with dead relatives and I think I just got a bit overwhelmed. But...? Oh, I, um... I didn't have a 'but'. I... I was just venting. Should I have had a 'but'? Yeah, you... You were meant to say, "But I like you." What? I don't know. I got awkward and laughed. Um... But, um... I like you. Feels really weird to say that out loud. I feel like people don't say that to each other, you know? I do. No, it's great. It's great. It's great. Um... Uh, why is this so hard? No, I'm messing with you. It's weird. So what now? There was actually something I've been meaning to ask you. Oh, yeah? Oh, Ellie, great. You look ready to go. Oh, um, but you... You'll just watch your language this time, yeah? Of course, miss. I am... I am absolutely not calling you a liar. I am simply saying it's not a day rate I believe I would ever quote. I need the Zimmerman quote on my desk asap. I... I... I am very sympathetic to your case. And it's true - we do offer services for clients who are in financial hardship. But it's in the form of a payment plan or prearranged pro bono. So, yes, I am more than happy to offer you a payment plan as well, sir, but, you know, I would never... What the fuck? No! No, sorry. That was not meant... Uh, no. Look, I'm... I'm gonna have to call you back. Fuck! Christopher! Do you still have those cigarettes? The ones you asked me to throw out? - Yes. - No, I threw them out. Thanks. OK. - Hi. - Sorry, are you driving? Oh, no, I opted to do a, uh, bike shift. I knew I couldn't get through today stuck in a car. Yeah, I'm not handling it very well this year. Well, why don't you go home? You know, maybe later, me, you, and Ellie can go out for dinner or something. You know, it never used to affect me, the date. You know, I never let it have it any power. I don't know what's going on with me this year. How are you? Go home, darling. And, um, let me know if Ellie finds herself in detention again. Maybe just start heading there. It'll take longer if you have to get her home on your bike. OK. After reaching 1.2 million women around the world, Faith Underwood had shown that you can have anything you want. You just have to put it out into the universe. Thank you. Thank you, Ellie. That was a very interesting choice. Abbie, you're up. Um, for my presentation today, I've decided to talk about an amazing woman who sadly lost her life at the Reclaim Oxford Street march run by the Conservative Party on Oxford Street in 1989. It was an anti-gay and lesbian rally designed to protest the growing national support for the LGBTQ community. They had reported that they would be expecting a turnout of 100,000 people, however, only 1,500 people turned up, which was trumped by the 5,000 gay and lesbian allies who showed up to protest the march. So while the day proved to be somewhat a success, it sadly ended in a tragedy. Tara Tilden was a much respected spokeswoman for the community and by the time she died, she'd been appointed head of the New South Wales Alliance and was running regular meet-up groups for teenagers. She was also known for her radical attempts to get her message across. Sadly, Tara lost her life at the end of the rally in 1989 when she was intentionally run down by a car full of men, who have never been identified. Where did you hear this crap?! - Ellie, wh... - Turn that thing off! What on earth are you doing? Sit down. Where did you get that photo of my aunt? - Your aunt? - That's my aunt. But that's not her. You've got the wrong photo. Ellie, I did my research. Ellie, could you please sit down? Everybody was very well behaved during your presentation, which was actually quite long, if I'm honest. My presentation was real. That's my aunt. But she wasn't murdered at some rally. It was an accident. Uh, Ellie, maybe you would feel more comfortable going to the library during Abbie's talk. No. I... I want her to admit that she made it up. Ellie, I'm sorry. I didn't know. What did you say this story was like? A car crash that you couldn't look away from? What an excellent pun. Where are you? This is crap, right? Oh, what, suddenly when I need you, you're not here?! Come on. Come out and tell them they got it wrong. - It's OK... - Don't touch me. Ellie, I really think you should... Go to hell. Come on. Where are you? I know you heard that. Come on. Don't be such a coward! Ellie, what's wrong? I need you to tell me what happened to Aunt Tara. - What? - How did she die? She died in a car accident, right? Darling, what's happened? Mum, please. What did Patty say to you? Patty? Nothing. I need you to tell me what's going on. How did she die? I don't... You never even met her. I don't understand why you're so upset. Mum! I don't wanna talk about it, OK? I tried very, very hard to protect you from that story. What will it achieve? I mean, look what's happened to Patty. She won't even retire. She won't even let herself deserve that. She doesn't need to be a fucking Uber driver. Patty? Patty and Tara were a couple. That's how I know Patty. I've already told you that. Well, they were together for years, since they were teenagers. I've never met two people who were so good together. And, um, after, well, uh, we never really left each other's side after that day. Mum... Mum, a girl in my class did an assignment on her. How did I never hear about this? Oh... Well, sadly, it was like a lot of terrible things that happened during that time. If you wanna know their stories, you have to go looking for them. You know, we tried to prove it wasn't an accident, but, um... It just went down as a hit and run, so... But it wasn't? It was not. We watched them as they steered towards her and we watched them as... ..as they ran her down. Well, who was it? - Why didn't you find them? - Oh, we tried. We tried incredibly hard, but then some other witnesses came forward, said it was an accident and then that was it. So you just... you just dropped it? Ellie, I... Mum, that's... that's pathetic! That's why they could get away with stuff like that! - Ellie, you... - You let her down! - You... you let her down. - Hey! You just... You shut up! You have no idea what you are talking about. None. You have no idea what it's like to spend every day fighting for justice. It killed your grandparents. It was like a... a cancer that destroyed this family. Knowing that something this awful has happened to someone you love, knowing that you were so powerless to stop it, replaying that scene over and over in your head, it just... it just guts you of everything you ever were as a person. And in the end, when no-one will help you, when you hit dead end after dead end for years, Ellie, years, the only kind thing you can do for your sister is the one thing that you can control. You can let her rest because she deserves it. Just don't. - Hey! - How you doing? Alright! - Whoo! - You look amazing! This is good. Hey, sis. Yeah! Today is not about violence. It's not about anger. And for us at least, it is not about aggravation. They claim they are taking back Oxford Street, as if they own it, as if we are taking something that was theirs, as if they've got nothing left. What they fail to understand is that Oxford Street is all that we have. It's our safe space. It welcomes us. It provides us with a place to dance, a place to fall in love. It provides us with a place where we can truly be ourselves. Today, we are not fighting. We are simply showing up. We are standing in solidarity with our street, a reminder of our community strength, and we can continue to hope for more safe spaces, for a time when we will have more places to dance, more places to fall in love, for a time when we will no longer have to show up and defend our place in this world. But while we do, well, let's just make sure we have a bloody good time doing it. Am I right? Take your bigotry away! Oxford Street is here to stay! Take your bigotry away! Oxford Street is here to stay! Take your bigotry away! Oxford Street is here to stay! Take your bigotry away! Oxford Street is here to stay! Take your bigotry away! Oxford Street is here to stay! Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Tara? Tara, are you... ..around? I'm sorry for what I said. I wish I hadn't said it. That's all. Hi. I'm sorry, but those are really great pyjamas. Yeah, I'm a horse girl. What are you doing here? Sorry to just drop by, but you weren't replying to my messages, so I thought I'd... You thought you'd just rock up at my house? - Pretty creepy. - I know. When you didn't reply to my messages, I didn't rock up at your house. I know, I know, but I have been here before when we did our assignment, so I didn't have to find out your address or anything. That would've been way worse, right? How did you know that stuff about my aunt? Where did you hear it? I, um... I met this woman at a meet-up group and told her I wanted to do someone from the community for my assignment and she suggested her. I can't believe so many people knew about her and I didn't. Yeah, she did some pretty amazing stuff. We were lucky to have her. Also, I'm, um... I didn't mean what I said about the whole car crash thing. I don't know why I said that. I wish I never said that. Like, I really am sorry about that 'cause she sounds really amazing. You have no idea. Well, I did my whole assignment on her. True. She's practically your aunt. So there was something I wanted to ask... How did you know? That it was... safe to like me? - What do you mean? - You know what I mean. Remember Jen Brinly? She left in Year 9? So we were, like, best friends in Year 7. We did everything together. I had a massive crush on her, but even then I knew better than to say anything. Plus, I was still so young, I was pretty confused about my feelings. But even as intuitive as I was not to say anything, I was still dumb enough to write it down. I had this stupid diary. It didn't even have a lock on it. I'm sure you can tell where this story is going. Anyway, um, one of the girls in my group took it out of my bag and told everybody, obviously, 'cause teenage girls are the fucking worst. Sorry, language. But I didn't know. I didn't know anything had changed until I went to hug her. So... so that's how I knew. Look, I know you were upset when you told me not to touch you, but that's where it takes me back to. And I meant what I said about not wanting to be jerked around. Like, I get it. I get it, Ellie. I get this all really new and exciting for you. But it's not for me. I never got to come out. I was outed. And I've managed to get through high school pretty much unscathed because I never even dreamt of dating or liking someone since then. I'm so sorry. But that was then, you know? No-one cares about that stuff now. Oh, if no-one cares, I guess I'll just get the fuck over it, then, shall I? And, no, I'm not gonna apologise for that. I'm sorry. You pursued me. I was fine and then there you were, just actively pursuing me. I told you I liked you. That's a massive deal for me. I felt open enough to respond and then you just fucking... I'm so sorry. I don't know how we got here. I just wanted to ask you to the formal. Yeah, and I wish you just fucking had, Ellie. Sorry. Fuck. Did Abbie say yes? No. Oh.

You are off your game, girl. You and Tara were together in high school, right? Yeah. I suppose she never asked you to the formal? Huh! No, it was never an option. They put one in my bag even though I told them not to. So I'm just gonna use it. Ends up in the bin regardless, right? I was gonna suggest you take that back to the store. - That's what I should've done. - Shit, I was joking! It's only one straw... ..said 18 billion people. Oh! - I'm so stressed. - Darling! If she had asked you to the formal, how do you think she would've done it? Well, we were pretty practical people. Sorry to be boring, Ellie. She was thoughtful. She had a way of remembering little things I said and turning them into something.

So you just have to... Shh! Just... just when she comes out, you just make sure that you are... - Your hair! - Isn't it amazing? - It's amazing. - Thank you. I'm gonna... Mmm! Mmm! Get some more champagne. Do you want some? How are we getting to the venue? Am I driving or... Oh, God, no. We'll get an Uber driver that isn't you. - Actually, do we need to book? - No, it's way too early. OK. - You really look beautiful. - Thank you. Thank you for always including me. Of course. Oh, my God! Where have you been? I actually thought I was quite quick. What kind of fairy godmother would I be if I didn't show up for your ball? Pour that champagne quick. I'm so pumped. - OK. - You look beautiful. And your hair! - Oh! Oops! - Oh, oh, quick, quick! Get something to clean that up. Patty, quick. - Mum, go to the kitchen too. - Um, really? - I've got it. It's alright. - That's very rude. Sorry. I know. Ellie, can you... can you just get off your phone, please? Alright, here we are. To Ellie... - We need to book the Uber! - What's that? - Quick, quick! - I thought it was too early. No, that was ages ago. Um, why don't you go out the front? - I'll meet you out there. - Why out the front? It's easier for the driver. Right, Patty? - Sure. Yep. - OK. - What's going on? - Come on. I think she got a surprise for us. - Oh! - So let's, um... Oh, we should've brought the bottle with us. It's about what happened to you. We found new information and... Is it OK if I say that I don't wanna know? - Right. Of course. - I know that seems strange. But I think it's awesome, what it is that you're doing. I just... ..I just really wanted to be here today for you. Totally. Totally. So tell me, are you attending this event with a certain horse-loving girl? No, I... I never asked her. What? Ellie, why not?! You were right. My whole idea was based on this stupid thing that I'd gotten from copying other couples and I realised that I wanted to do something special that was just for us, something different... because I am different. But I couldn't think of anything. Nothing. And then I started thinking, "Well, what does that mean? "Maybe... maybe I don't know her at all "and maybe I'm just assuming that... that she'd say yes. "Maybe I'll just ask when "there wasn't as much pressure." Then I thought, "Maybe I'm "overthinking the entire thing." - Is my chest getting blotchy?! - OK, OK. Ellie! The Uber's almost here! Damn, it's way too early. Alright? Now, if there's nothing else we need to do, let's have that toast. To my beautiful daughter, who not only surprised everyone by topping her history class with her beautiful speech on Faith Underwood, but who has just turned out so good, better than I could have hoped, and, uh, that's despite having me as her mum. Oh, Mum, none of that! Come on. I agree. Can we just cry at the venue, please? - Cheers. - Cheers. Heads! God, I am sick to death of this. - Are you kidding me? - Wait, Mum! I... I need that. And I need a pen and paper. I mean, I'm fairy godmother of the year! I could just teleport there! This is such moral support. ♪ I feel contrived ♪ On the behalf of every love... ♪ Saddles may be balanced different ways for different horses, different riders or different disciplines. So for example... ..if we're jumping and we have a saddle that's built for jumping, the balance on that saddle is going to be slightly more forward... I lied. I'm not into AFL. But I am into you. I'll be at the formal. Meet me there if you like. P.S. I really hope you do. - Was she there? - She was there. Just give me a second and then we can go. OK. I mean, I'm a ghost. I'm fine. I'm just sympathetic panting, but... Make the only high you have tonight a sugar high. We're offering students a chance to trade in their drugs for chocolates. I don't have any drugs, but I'll take a chocolate. That's not really how it works. Your pupils are really large. OK, take a chocolate. - Hi, miss. - Oh! Uh, hello, miss. Hello, miss... Hello, Ellie! Hello. Um, the formal's inside. I know. I was just getting some fresh air. Yep. That's good. Weird, it smells a bit like pot out here. Ha-ha! Um... Yes, well, I will see you back inside, Miss Ellie. Good luck with your future! You have got to be kidding me! - Oh! - What? Oh, my God. You scared me. Is that your horseriding outfit? Well, you left it pretty last-minute. This is the fanciest thing I own. It has a pocket, see? Jealous. Out here having a ciggie, are ya? No! Oh, it was... it was a joke. Right. Right. Though it does smell a lot like pot out here. I'm really glad you came. I'm glad you asked, although talking about leaving it to the last minute... I'm so sorry... about everything. Oh, me too. Um, I have many regrets. "Never regret anything because at one point in time, "it was exactly what you wanted." Um... no. No, I never wanted you to find about your aunt's death in my history speech. Yeah, that sucked. I think I might be done with the inspirational quotes. No, don't be like that. "Be yourself. Everyone else is taken." I do like that one, though. Um... You look really pretty. Thanks. You look... like you belong at the Olympics, in a good way. Oh, by the way, Adam Goodes. That's an AFL player, just for future conversation. Do you wanna dance? Yeah. Oh, maybe not in there. I'm...
