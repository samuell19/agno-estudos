Come on, here! No, here! Great! Hi boys! So you're on the bench today. I have a cold. - A cold? It's best you don't swim then. Good to see you back, Karsten. Everything OK with you? I'm fine. That stuff wasn't good, but it will all be OK after a while. Gunnar says that you are making a really cool doghouse! What sort of dog do you have? - A mixed race. What sort of mixture? - Terrier and some other stuff. Terrier? They are nice. I have a Labrador retrever. I've had it since I was fifteen. Bjarte! Stop that right now! Do you want to sneak out? OK then, we'll check who's here. Astrid, Mertha, Ivan, Mathias... What's your name? - You know that. You are new here. - I've been here for over half a year. Have you seen anything as ugly before? Let's smash it. This one too. I can't believe it possible. All you have to do is, throw some clay on the potter's wheel and sit there and hold it for a minute. Check this out! We even have a crematorium oven and all! Do you know how they do it down in Nepal? - What? When somebody dies, they burn them on the bonfire. Why? - To get rid of them, of course! They don't cry or anything down there. They just jump and sing and play drums and are totally crazy. They don't know what mourning is. They just don't mourn. The cool part however is, when the body really catches fire, then the belly contracts so that the body sits up on the bonfire. The eyes pop out and the lips really burn, and then in the end, bang! the head explodes. I can't get the oven turned off. Do you know how to turn it off? Where did you live before you came here? I have been living a lot of places. You haven't got many friends. There aren't many that like you. You shouldn't think that many people like you either. Haven't you even been dead one time‽ That's right. Where did you hear that? There was just someone who talked about it. Tell me, what happened? I was out walking my dog when I tied it up and just dove in to the water. Then I swam down to the bottom and held on to something. Was it on purpose? - Of course it was on purpose! If not I would just have swam up again! Did it hurt? No, it was just good. Do you understand? Yes. You don't understand shit. Nobody understands shit! Hei Thomas! Move! - No, you have made it yourself! Move, I said! - No, we have to get out of here! Move! Karsten! Put that axe down! What is wrong with you‽
