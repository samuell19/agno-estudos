Vladik, stand up. Wake up, my soul. Mama ... Get up, my soul! Who is not ready for a new morning? Come on, get up. We're late, we're late Jo� place... Well, as you wish. I will go by car bus. I'm not going by bus, I'm going with you. Then be in the dining room in ten minutes. Alright. You worked all night again? Zato sam do�ao do finala. Sergey, it shouldn't be like that. You need to sleep at night. Every person needs a peaceful sleep, it shouldn't be like that. I have such a job. Inspiration comes at night and doesn't leave until morning. "Aunt" that rarely comes. My poor, poor... Inspiration rarely comes to us... Sergey, fear God. Four novels a year. And only since the day we met. So, I made the right choice. Honey, give me some bread, please. Honey, give me some bread, please. Honey, give me some bread, please. Zna�, ju�e sam videla Rudakova. He invited us to the jubilee. Shall we go? Excellent. We haven't seen each other in a hundred years. Sergey, please make an effort, buy a present. Okay, I'll try. Mom, can I get a present, a new computer game? He can't. Get busy studying. English studies. It will benefit you. And. what "yes"? Valentina Jurjevna, among other things, is not happy with you... He says that he doesn't pay attention in class, he doesn't listen to anyone. I am bored. Ženja and I have already crossed it this year. And why did Valentinka put me in the first pew. First, not Valentinka, but Valentina Jurjevna. And secondly, she did it because I asked her to. Za�to to ? So, Vlad! Spava� na �asovima! First, I wasn't sleeping, I was dozing. And secondly, why is it a problem to close your eyes for a moment? And now? What should I do in the first bench? Be present, Vlad. I already said - I find it boring and uninteresting. Oni samo bukvar �itaju a ja Marka Tvena zavr�avam ! Huh? �ta ti na to ka�e�? Vlad, forgive me, please. I just get very annoyed when teachers criticize you. Okay, no. Anyway, you can't sleep in the first bench. Vlad, don't move. So, cap... �al ... Mom, what's wrapping me up like a doll? Come here. When he is on the street - he will change his mind. And even as a child I didn't like wrapping. I went out naked on the street and spent a month with pneumonia. Appreciate what you learn from the mistakes of others. Look at me. Thank you . Happy day. Thank you. Done, let's go. Come on. �enja! What a place! Here is the grocery list, don't forget to pay� the phone. OK? OK, bye. Hello. Hello. Hello. And! Da popri�amo. Come on. About what? O budu�nosti. A tempting offer. About us in the future. O �emu ti to? Difficult sam. The test gave a positive result. She must have an abortion. That's all. And ... Of course... I understand that this is unexpected for you, but I will not abort. And how do you even imagine all that? Everything should be told to Anna. Well, whenever it has to be done. Why not now? And with what money does he think he lives? Smisli�emo ne�to. Mi? That. After all, they publish your novels. You can't even pay for an apartment with my novels. And in general, what kind of joint future is he talking about? You told me you loved me�. Stop. Stop, stop. I love you, but... Maybe it was ... comfortable for you? I am ready for anything for you. And what are you ready for? �enja ... �enja, �enja ... Forgive me, today is a busy day for me. Conclusion of the contract. And you know how important that is to me. I cannot solve such serious problems in one second. Give me time to think. Alright. Come on, run, run! Hello, mom! Vlad! �ta? Don't forget, the girl will come for you today! Good! Hello, mom! Hello! Hello. Good morning, Anna Sergeyevna. Where did you come from? From there. On parole. For good behavior. What do you need? I came to see you and to talk. O �emu? Well, I understand that there is nothing to talk about. You got the divorce. And. You got married, huh? And. All is well. And I have several topics to talk about. Well, I have a little time. I understand. The job is waiting. And. Pri�eka�e. I want to know how Vladik is. Vladik is good. Next topic. In short, I want to see him. Not. What else? Not? All. But I have much more than that! But now I'm interested in my family. You are interested in your family... You were gone for three years. During that time, your family has changed a lot. Vladik has an oca ... I don't care who he has there. Clear? While I am his biological father. And they will. And no one has denied me parental rights yet. And I will copy you. If he doesn't stop interfering in our life. Listen, I'm... I know I'm guilty, it's true. That I am guilty before you. But believe me, I paid for it in full. You are all I have. To me... I really don't need anyone else... And at all... I don't want to lose you. No, no, Andrei. It's too late for changes now. I haven't said everything yet. Look, I don't have time for unplanned conversations. I will schedule an interview. Get lost! Why so long? Valentinka praised me today, said that I am a hero. Beautiful Today we did the application. I finished everything first! Vlad, just ... And Valentinka praised me! No need to shout, I can hear you perfectly. Do you think I deserve "Lego" or a new computer game? I can't answer that question, because I simply don't know. Well, I'm a hero! That's what mom says. Stan, Vlad ... Don't forget about �lan. Mom hasn't arrived yet? Not yet. Maybe it will come soon. Don't interrupt. I signed the contract today. In a month, the first hardcover edition will be released. Is that good? That is very good. Vlad, repeat, please, new words. Ne�to and re�io? And. I start working from tomorrow. I have a month to finish the novel. I'm not talking about that. Honey, now is not the time for that. And when will it be time? When my stomach grows, or maybe when the baby is born? Alright. If Ana finds out, she will throw us out of the house. You really want him to give up our future? Vlad, I don't hear you. Is that your final decision? I haven't said anything yet. Just... Hello, mom. Zdravo, Vladik. And I have good news. Hello. �estitaj mi. After your call, the editor immediately signed a contract with me. And he said that my novel has a bright future. I congratulate you. What happened? I have inconvenience. Come here. My ex-husband is back. He was in prison for financial fraud. He was released on condition of good behavior. Stop! Stop, stop, stop. And why don't I know anything about him? What did you want him to know? That I have an ex-husband? That he is in prison? Yes, FYI. Listen, Serjo, we lived well without this information. Mom, my dad came? He will come to visit us? Bishop, it's not nice to eavesdrop. And anyway, go up. Brush your teeth and lie down to sleep. Don't you know me? Vlad! Sergej, tell him, I'm not able. Shall we go? Let's go. What did Andrej want? He wanted to call. He dragged himself into the office - hello, I'm your Andrej! And what did he want? Son to see. It's like, it's hard for him without us. And you are what? And what am I? I chased him away. Anja, mo�da ... �ta? To return it�? Are you crazy? And why? He is Vladik's father. And he loves him. Vladik has an excellent relationship with Sergej, they get along well. Why would you destroy all that? Anja, you yourself saw how excited Vladik was. It's all nonsense. It is ... It is ordinary childishness. You loved him so much... I am happy with my husband. I don't want to change anything. I just asked, as a possibility. No, my dear sister, that possibility does not suit us. Put the sheet under the pillow. Good? It should not be put under the pillow, but given to mom. What? Give it to mom? It's a place. Hi there. Hello. Hello. Se�a� li me se? I remember. You are my dad. Correct, hero. How have you grown... Well, do you want to have fun with me? Yes, yes. Then let's go. Let's go. No, stop. I'm not letting him go anywhere. Why more? Calm down. I have already agreed with my mother. Ana is in progress. And she didn't say anything to me. She didn't say? Then call her and ask. Alo. Hello, Anja? Andrej took it. �ta? Andrej took Vlad. I'll come right away! It will be your birthday soon. Yes, soon. Then come on... Do not pass. Take a look at the unique offer. With your purchase, you get this kind of bonus card. During the next purchases... Shall we choose a gift? And. Alright. What would you like? "Lego" or a new computer game. And the new dad doesn't buy you presents? He buys. True, he and mom think, that they will learn even worse from the new players. And it seems to me, if I study well, I should get a reward. You know what? We'll do it like this. I don't know when I will see you next time. So I will give you a present now, but you have to promise me, that he will study well for the whole week. Deal? Deal. Yes ... Well, let's go. Where su oti?li? Looks like fun. We have to go there. Where? Do you know how many places there are in the city? I do not know! But we have to split up. wait. I will let you know. What was the car like? Old, green. Looks like Toyota. Did you remember the number? That. Only 678 numbers. And the letters i ... Vladik, sine! Dad and I had fun! It was great! And then we went to a cafe. Take it. Vladik, do�i kod mene. What are you waiting for? Arrest him! All is well? Yeah, okay. My good... Show your documents. Don't I have the right to walk with my son? He must not tell my family! Do you understand? To your family? All is well? If you hadn't created it. You built the house, you raised the boy. Yes? Why did you destroy everything, if it was so beautiful? To te se ne ti�e. I told you - you understood me. Okay, go home, I'll take care of it. Go home. What do you allow yourself? Go to the house. Look, I don't understand you. When he doesn't deal with his son - it's bad for you. When he deals - also bad. Everything is fine with Bishop. He has someone to have fun with. That I don't see you here anymore. Do you understand? You can't forbid me. I am his father. I have the right to see him too. So, Andrej, he'd better have a conscience. Vlad, I almost went crazy! I thought I could do it with dad. He's not your dad! Za�to? That's why! He was your dad, once upon a time! He has a new dad now. Vladik, let's make an agreement. Never do that again. Good? And. Anja, it's not Vlad's fault, it's my fault. I have to do something, I have to stop him somehow. Okay, go to your room. Let's go. I don't like this sudden manifestation of paternal feelings. What is it for? A cheap game for the public. Looks like it's not a one-off. That's what pays me. So, Bishop, we are already a little late. A little - that's not strange. It's not terrible... So, my dear, if you allow yourself to be late, then he shows� lack of concern for others. Therefore, no one will respect you either. Mama ... Is it her name? We have few problems in life... But my dad is good. Who told you that? Nobody. I said it myself. I love him. You are still young to know people. Trust me, a good man - that's not the one who gives you gifts. And who is it then? Who cares about you, who loves you. Who only does good things. So my dad is good. He has a new dad. He is a good and decent man. He loves you and cares for you. Yes, but ... And. That is me. Open the door. Ana is not here. I came to my son. He's not here, they're gone. And can I wait for them? Yes, yes. Hello. Hello. I don't think Ana will like your visit. Well, I'm not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone. Yes, nothing has changed in the house. Sergej wanted to make an overhaul, but Ana didn't want to change anything. That's why everything remained as before. The garden is, in truth, neglected, because no one cares for it. Well, if I don't find a job, I'll be a gardener here. �aj? And. What are you doing here? How did he get here? What do you mean, I don't know how to get to my house? On what issue? And you are the secretary? What does he allow himself? Listen, my friend, let's make it a little simpler. That? Get out of my house! Listen, igolo, are you going to order me around? The cops will explain to you where your house is. Does he understand me? Andrew! Andrej, let him go! Andrei, let him go! Did you get everything done? Just remember, I won't give up. Clear? Thanks for the tea. You and I will meet again. Does it hurt? Normally. He shouldn't have been let here. And what, he should have been expelled? Enough! He has nothing to do here. Or maybe the opposite? What about the opposite? Let him return to the family. Are you crazy? A �to? Vlad would have a father. And so does my child. You are paranoid. I knew that pregnant women get numb, but not to such an extent! Not to such an extent that they wouldn't understand that you... You will not change anything. Maybe you don't need me? Enough, enough, enough, enough. Come on, no nonsense. Come up with something smarter! �enja ! Leave me alone! Ta�nije. Enough for today. Bravo. Hello mom. But that's a kind of rage! Does he understand? He attacked me, I didn't even do anything! It's your own fault. And who threatened him with the militia? Andrej is a proud man. I think you should write a statement to the militia. Let them speak to him in their language. No need. No statement to the militia is needed. I will discuss with him. Documents for signature. Yes. Julja, make coffee, please. Alright. I jo�. Call the head of security, please. Alright. Good afternoon. This is a security agency. Okay, read on. Hello. Hello. Please study. Hello. Oleg. I'm glad. You can study in the dining room, make yourself comfortable. Thank you. Excuse me, hey, coffee? No Thanks. Coffee. Black, strong, without sugar. Alright. Oleg ... I wouldn't even refuse lunch. This is my husband, ex-husband. I wouldn't want him to cause inconvenience to our family. And jos �ivi u k�i? Come on, come down, please, down here, with Vlad. And pick up Sergej, security has come. And. Security came there. What security? I do not know. Anja said that we should go down to the dining room. What kind of nonsense is that? Why didn't she tell me anything? Hands up! I am - Iron Man - Tony Stark! Alright. let's go see what kind of security it is. Everyone stay put! It's me - Tony Stark! Vlad, stop it! Give me the slot machine. Here, meet each other, please. This is my son, this is my younger sister, Đenja. I'm glad. Me too. This is my husband Sergej. This is security. We will have security. Vladimir. Oleg. We will be in the house 24/7 in shifts. Oleg is in charge. And for Tony Stark, please - don't leave the house without us. Clear? Clear? That. Honey, take the boys to another room, please. Of course. Shall we? Thank you. I'm with you. This way. Thank you. Come on. Is it for a long time? I do not know. Maybe, until everything is said. So, the presence of foreigners in our house does not inspire me at all. Honestly, that's not what they're here for. Tell me, do you really think that this is the best way out of the situation? How should I know? At the very least, it can be better than the militia. Truth? That way everything will be calmer. Sergey, don't worry... Look, I'll do everything so that no one bothers you. Alo. I'm already sleeping. Won't take it? That's my husband. �ta? That is, that is Andrej. He won't let us live now? It's nothing. Zva�e, zva�e - and stop. And you don't just want to send him somewhere further? Give me. No need, I'll take care of it. Hello. Thanks for the advice. Who said it? Yes. But we can't meet. Look, I've said everything, I won't repeat it a second time. Is that all? What did he want? Let's meet. AND? �ta "i"? Ti si �uo sve. I just heard "I won't repeat." And "Leave me alone, I never want to see you again" was not heard. Act no�. Good morning. Do you want coffee? With pleasure. Oleg, what time do you finish today? When the shift comes. At seven. At seven, yes? You know I have a request for you. Of course. Just eat, eat. Say, can you talk to my ex-husband? Not a problem. And? Then I will write you the address. He will be here tonight at this address in the bar. And what, there are no more free tables? Yes, but I'm bored. I have no one to talk to. And why did you decide that I would talk to you? Well, if you don't want to - shut up. I will speak, and you just listen. Come on. It's not a very good story here. I don't understand something. Where is that "us"? Do you want to understand? How is it? "You shouldn't learn the same river twice"? Or maybe, it's not good to learn from the family, which supposedly is no longer yours? I understood. Ana sent you? No, I, as an iron man, appear where necessary. You show up where needed. But don't get into other people's business. I think you didn't properly understand the point of the conversation. I wanted to warn you. All these intrusions into the lives of others usually end badly. Listen, iron man, don't pay me. I have already been paid. And with my wife, I will take care of everything myself. My good advice is to avoid inconvenience. I warned you. I understood you. Let me help you? Thank you. I was passing through your house. It's pleasant here. Warm. I mean - hospitable. Is that ... And earlier... It was really warm and comfortable here. My brother liked to gather loud company, invited a lot of friends, made a barbecue. It was cheerful. And now, somehow... It's so cold and empty. That's because it's winter? Not. Because Kostje is no longer there. And where is he? Anja's ex-husband, Andrej, dragged him into financial machinations. Kostja was a very good accountant. They discovered them. Both were convicted. Kostya could not stand it and hanged himself in his cell. Sorry for starting the topic, I didn't know. It's nothing. As you move, "you". Familiarity is somehow not allowed here. And with us, "YOU" is not allowed. Good. Deal. Hello. Good morning. Ana Sergeevna, they are waiting for you there in the office... What is he doing in my office? I understand that ... Bring coffee, Julja! Alright. There will be no other place to talk. Listen, why are you running away from me like the plague? Reason? Ako si do�ao da talka� o tome, I have neither the time nor the desire to talk about it. Listen, you think you can throw me out of your life so easily? We have lived so much. Everything, in my opinion, was good. Well, that was - that was. All right. He doesn't want to talk about the personal, let's talk about the necessary. I want to start my own business. Business, he realizes, from scratch. I came to ask for money. Yes? How can he ask me for money? And who else should I ask? I have no relatives, I have lost friends. Only you. Besides, I didn't come to beg. I will return it, with interest. And you haven't tried the bank? I don't understand, what did I do to you so badly? You betrayed us. You betrayed me. You betrayed your son. You betrayed our family. You betrayed your whole life. I am nobody to you. Now I'm a stranger to you. Ni ro�ak ni �ena. In my opinion, I have served my duty. And he paid for his sins. And how will he pay for my brother? Clear. I understood everything. Good luck! �ta �ita�? I found it here. I decided to get to know the hosts. I ? Crime. Nothing so special. Nothing special... Ni�ta. Already on the fifteenth page, it is clear who the murderer is. Good mark. Just between us. Of course. Sometimes it seems to me that I could write better. What is the problem? Write it down. Well, some people are given the career of a writer, and some are not. Listen, are you finishing soon? Evo, smena treba da do�e. I wanted to read. Maybe join me? Of course, if you don't have a wife and children waiting at home. I am not married, no one is waiting for me at home. I �ta? And. Nice. I'm going to change? Good. Hello. Hello. So, how is it? Normally. Listen, Volo, I met the ex-husband of our landlady... Za�to? Anna Sergeyevna asked. And what did he say? What did he say? "Don't get into my stuff, I'm into it." He said well. Our task is to protect the family. Am I bothering you? No, that... My wife hasn't arrived yet? It's already. I am, in principle, ready. Where are you going? So, let's go. So what? Nice work. So, shall we go? Hold on. Look which side the killer is on. Have a nice evening everyone. A break of fifteen minutes. With such an interest, do you get along well with people? A little bit. And what does he say about me? And chased. And as a psychologist? Well, I'm not a psychologist. I'm a security guard. It just seemed to me that these two professions are connected. Psychologists sit in offices, and custodians are people of action. Have you ever shot a man? It was happening. Is it strange? What? To shoot? To shoot, when he knows that he will not rise again. Do you know how it is with us? Whoever shoots first survives. No fear. It's strange for me to even imagine... You chose that profession. I'm not a murderer. I'm a security guard. My job is to protect people. What a sad topic I chose! Shall we go play? Come on. Hello. Hello. Will we see each other? Of course. By the way, does he have a shift tonight? Yes, of course. Mo�e. And. What was that? �ta to? Your imagination. I am a free man, I can do what I want. And what were you doing? Is this an interrogation? I didn't hear an answer. If you haven't figured it out yet, I went out with a man. What happened? Ka�i. And. Fool. What a fool you are... Because I love you. Only you. I'm tired! Does he understand? I'm tired of everything! I'm tired of hiding. I'm tired of hiding my feelings. Does he understand? I'm tired. I can't do this anymore. I don't know how much longer I will last! Hello. Hello. Hello guys. Who is the elite? Who is it? Tekilu. Kristina, give us two tequila shots. Here you go. Hello. What, you don't sleep that early? It is not allowed at work. Clear. I go to the smell of coffee like a dog to meat. I don't mind. Why ... Let's join the company. Good morning. I didn't hear you get up. I have a headache in the morning. I showered. I'm better. Did you not see the bishop? He's probably sleeping. No, it's not there. I thought he was here, at your place. He wasn't here. He didn't go out on the street? I'm down all the time. He didn't pass me by. �enja! �enja! Woman, wake up, I can't find Vlad! Alo. The sooner he collects two million dollars, the sooner the Government will see it. Clear? Listen to me carefully. No one leaves the house. My boys are supervising. The money should be brought home to you. When I get a signal that the money is in place - call and let me know how he will hand them over. And don't try to call the police. Bi�e gore. Hello, Volo�a. Yes, it's me. Come. We have an emergency. Yes, Anna Sergeevna! Good afternoon. Igor Vladimirovich, I need your help. I understood. Yes, yes. Of course. Good. I'm waiting. Hello! To Igor Dimitrijevi�u, yes. Okay, I'm waiting. He will bring the money right away. Everything will be fine. U�ite. Thank you . Good afternoon. Anna Sergeevna, here is exactly two million. Thank you very much, Igor Dimitrijevi�u. Ana Sergeevna, maybe you need some help? No, you ... Vi ste ve� u�inili mnogo. Igor Dimitrijevi�u, may I? That. I have another big request. Let this stay between us. Anna Sergeevna, you know me. That's why I turned to you. Thank you once again. With your permission, may I go? The money is in place. Yes, everything is calm. Aha. Anju... I'm sure everything will be fine. He will get the money and calm down. Nothing will happen to Bishop. Sorry. Calm, calm. Come, come here. What happened? Look, I lost my boyfriend. �ta? Who will know him! I dozed off a bit. And the boy's father somehow entered the house and stole the boy. Now he's asking for a ransom. Hello. That's ... what should I do? Turn on the speakerphone. Alo. I was told that everything went smoothly and that he had money. Andrej, the money is at home. Please give me my son back! Slu�aj �he has seen it. The sister takes her backpack, puts on her skis and goes to the field outside the city. You know that place, we often went there. My husband will meet her on the way. After handing over the money, the boy is free. And the same thing. He will do as I said. And if he starts with nonsense and the conditions are not met... Andrej, look, why can't I give you that money myself? It's two hours. That's all! Time is running out! What? What should I do? Excuse me, may I? �enja ... Женя, my dear... Please. And if he kills me? Don't worry, we will do everything possible to prevent this from happening. You have already done everything possible. Listen, try to find the number. I agree. Bravo. Good boy. Where is my son? I'm asking you! Where is my son? He's fine! Show me your son! Yes, yes, good. I understood everything, understood. Done. Listen, Volo. We found the point from which they called. Alright. Well, ready! Let's go. I'm going with you. No, I can't put you in danger. I am not in danger, but my son. Okay, just no nonsense. Well! Stay at home, stay connected! Stay here and wait for the call. And what about him? I'll call. Yes, almost, understood. Come on. Thank you, Eremej�ik. Everything will be fine. Thank you. Volo�a! �ta? Look at. So, we located the call about here. Here's the address, bro. How are we going to do it? So. You go there and I'll cover the girl. Look, nothing must happen to her. I understand. Let's go. Take off your backpack. Stop! How are you? Not, ho�emo it? These dole! It started badly! That sled came first! And then a guard appeared from somewhere and started shooting at him! They shot at each other. Looks like they died. I don't know what to do. And. Alright. It's here. Stay in the car, it can be dangerous. They won't turn off the engine. If something happens - go. Kisses pi�tolj. Pistol. Come on! Where is my son? I would also like to know. Re�ili ste da mi smestite? Calm, calm. You! Where is my son! Tell me! Tell me, where is my son! Where is my son? Kisses pi�tolj! Kisses pi�tolj. Oleg does not answer. ok i hope that your son is somewhere nearby with money, alive and well. So what happened? Everything went wrong. First, your man came on a sleigh, and the guard for some reason started shooting at him He ran to us, he fell. Then the guard came to us, and he shot the guard. What specifically worries you? You said that the plan was perfect, that everything would go as planned. Where is the money? �ta? The money is here. There are no witnesses. Isn't it perfect? Vlad is behind that door. I have to go. By the way, I'll hide the money. Slu�aj me. After fifteen minutes, he called his sister and said, that when handing over the money there was a shooting, two were killed. The third brought you here, took the money and left. Razume� li? Vlad! �enja! Vlad! Vlad, my dear! Girl, I want to go home to my mom! Let's go now! Everything will be fine now. Everything will be fine. Come on. Let's go home. Let's go right now. Wait there, we need to talk. Good. Good. Vlad, everything will be fine. Come here. Now, wait. I don't like this. He is our video, he is the witness. And what? He must stay here. Stop! That was not discussed! It's not a debate! �enja! Vlad, tr�i! Don't touch the child. I'm begging you - don't touch Vlad. It's here. Come on. Sorry, I thought it was you. We'll talk later. The main thing is now - find the Government. �enja! �enja! �enja ... �enjecka ... Call an ambulance. ... He will kill him. Vlad! Vlad! Stop! Girl, how did this happen... How could this happen? I'm sorry ... mi ... Andrej, stay with her. Good. Vlad! Hello, emergency? Come now! The man is dying! Address? I don't know what the address is! Alo ! Vlad! Vlad! Okay, okay, calm down! That is me! Let go ! Did you recognize it? That. All is well. Let's go. �ekaj, and �u pomo�i. Come on. So... What? what about you? Normally. The bullet went through, it seems. Where is Vlad? That's where he ran away. Hell! Why are you, Vlad, running away from dad? You are not my father! Vlad, go away. Vlad, go away! Pa! Tata. Vlad! Vladik ... Tata, tatice! Vlad! Mother! Mother!
