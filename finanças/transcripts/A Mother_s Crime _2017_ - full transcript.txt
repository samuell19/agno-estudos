Who was it this time, Danielle? There wasn't anyone... Quit lying to me! I'm telling the truth! We'll see about that... Let me go! Where are you gonna go, Danielle? Away from you! You're pathetic, no one's gonna take you in. I said let me go! Get back here! Hi darling. Ma, what are you doing? You know we pay the gardener for this. I know, son. Whatever Ma, I don't have time for this right now. Where were you? I didn't hear you come in. Well, I'm in. You could at least try to be here when I get home. Danielle... who do we know in the 5-2-0 area code? You're checking the phone bill? We have unlimited calling. Who do you know in Tucson? Maybe your mom knows someone there. I mean it's her house. Dani, who do you know in Tucson? I don't know anyone in Tucson. Just like you didn't know anybody in Santa Fe? How did you...? Oh come on, Danielle! You're not as clever as you think you are. You never wondered why he stopped calling? What did you do? I didn't do anything. But the guy that I hired, now he did a number on him. I think it's time that we give Mr. Tucson here the same message. Maybe this time you'll learn a lesson about respect. Come on, we're gonna go for a little walk. Yeah yeah, shhhh, it's okay. It's okay. Junior? No! No, no, no!

Do you know me? I'm your Aunt Danielle. Hey Becky, what's wrong? Hi, sis. Go! We just need a place to stay the night. You got knocked up, good for you. Now please leave. I didn't get knocked up, I got married. Congratulations. But you used up all my good will up years ago. My husband and I had a big fight and I will go in the morning and I will make up. I just need-- seriously, just for the night. I don't want you around my daughter! Everything okay? Hi, I'm Danielle, Nikki's sister. Hi, I'm Jacob. Millie. Nikki and I teach third grade together for eight years and I didn't know Nikki had a sister. Well, I just stopped by to spend the night and let Nikki get to know her little niece... if that's okay, sis? Of course... Great! Hush little baby, don't say a word. Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird. If that mockingbird don't sing, daddy's gonna buy you a diamond ring. I've been meaning to get rid of that. I didn't think I would have any use for it again. I was so sorry to hear about your husband. He left you a beautiful home. Not sorry enough to come to the funeral or send a card. I was in a really bad place at the time. Prison or rehab? What's her name? Cali. She was born in the middle of the summer and the air conditioning went out, so... muy caliente. It's a cute name. See you in the morning... Away we go. Sweetie, are you okay? Sweetie? Oh my God. Oh my God, you're burning up. You're gonna be fine, you're gonna be... Ma'am, what's wrong with your baby?

And if you do them knowing that they're going to hurt other people, well, that's what your aunt does. She seems nice. Maybe you're right, maybe she's changed. We'll see. Now off you go, before we're both late. Hey you! You obviously don't know... Know what? What are you going to do? Call the police. Well... I mean, she's your sister. That's never stopped me before.

Just my baby got sick, but she's fine now. Baby? You brought your baby with you? Well... yeah. When you said you wanted to be with me, I thought you meant just you. But she's my baby...

Nikki Hansen, come down to the front desk. Nikki Hansen please report to the front desk. There she is! Code grey! Hello? Yes, this is Nikki Hansen. You've got to be kidding me. No no, just give me a few hours to get there. Hi, I'm here to pick up Cali Newman. I'm Nikki Hansen. Really? The real Nikki Hansen. Can I see some ID please? Umm... the only thing I have is a teacher's ID. Hi. Hey. Hi. Thanks for coming over tonight. I really needed to talk to a lawyer, and since you already know part of the story... It's not a problem. Glad to help. I just came from Las Cruces, as you can see... You have a baby. Not what I was expecting when you called. So, umm... what am I going to do? What do you want to do? Scream. Danielle is probably going to be charged with manslaughter. She's claiming that she was protecting the baby, but a jury may not buy that. And it will be tough for the prosecution to prove a premeditated murder. And the baby? Your sister was captured leaving the hospital without her child. Which means technically, she abandoned the baby. Now because she did so at a hospital, that falls under Safe Haven law. No charges will be filed against her. But child services is likely to rule that doing so means she gave up her parental rights. And the father is dead? Right. So technically, the baby has no legal parents right now. Child services will next look to a suitable relative to place the child with. Me... And the grandmother? Beatrice. I just got off the phone with her. First, there's her age. Secondly, Danielle just killed her son. She is a wreck and there's no way she can take a baby. Ultimately that's gonna be up to child services, but that leaves you. Well... or the other option. Nikki? Hey. Hey you guys. Oh, so precious. Oh my gosh. Hey sweetie, I'm heating up a bottle in the kitchen. Could you go get it? Okay. Thank you. Hi, hi! Well, you didn't waste any time. Well, what am I supposed to do? Danielle is going to prison and I can't take the child. If you put her up for adoption, Becky's going to be heartbroken. I know. Can I feed her? Thank you! Yeah, I guess you're old enough. Okay so, you need to cradle her in your arms like you do with your dolls. Good, wow. You're going to make a great mom. That was my birthday wish. I'm so happy my birthday wish came true. Thank you so much Millie, for picking her up from school. Yeah. Hey Becky, will you do me a favor and walk Millie out for me? Thank you. Oh my goodness, I know. Thank you, thanks Millie. Yeah. Boy oh boy oh boy. Hey... there you go. These are the custody papers. They state that you are giving up your parental rights and your sister, Nikki, will legally adopt the baby. You will not have the right to interfere with Nikki's raising of the child. You knew. You knew that you could abandon your baby and I would take her in. That I would clean up your mess. That's right. I knew Saint Nikki would save the family screw up once again. Why did you kill him? Why didn't you just leave? Because I'm not the kind of mother they give custody to. And I couldn't risk him getting custody when I knew he would hurt the baby. And I didn't think any character witnesses would speak on my behalf. That's right, Danielle. You're my sister and I love you, but I can't think of one good thing to say about you. Give her a good life, Nikki. Make sure she's happy. ♪ Upbeat dance music ♪ Upbeat dance music What do you think? What do you think? Mommy, is Grandma Beatrice coming? Sweetie, you know she can't drive because of her eye sight, right? I know, I just miss her. Well, she did send you a present. Is it a puppy? That's what she wished for when she blew the candles out. Hey! It was supposed to be a secret. Like she doesn't already know. Let's go look at the presents. Now, where were we? Who's this creep with the camera? What? Hey! He was on a public street, but you know. An older guy watching little kids leave a birthday party... No Jacob, I completely understand. I'll run his description through the database. Listen, something similar happened last year. Turned out to be a divorced dad who missed his son. Yeah. Yeah, maybe that's it. Thanks. You bet. See ya. See you. Hey wait, you didn't have breakfast. I made pancakes. I'm not hungry. But you love pancakes! Okay, what did I do this time? Now is not the time. It's never the time. Okay, now is the time. Look, Jacob is my husband. But he's not trying to replace your father. Could have fooled me. He's my dad. Becky! Please do not grow up to be a bratty teenager. No promises. Ugh! All right, get your stuff. Got it? Yup. Next time I ask you if you have your lunch, be sure to check if you actually have your lunch. Hey... can you come over here? I think someone broke into the house. No, I'm just sure. The door was open, but I'm sure that I closed it. And Cali's bear... ...you know how she always wants him to face her while she's sleeping... but he's not. They're fine, they're in the car. He's here. Hey! You guys all right? Well guys, there's no sign of forced entry. The alarm system's working. What do you think he wanted? I don't know, Nikki. We ran his description, but came up empty. There have been a few break-ins in the area, but not by anybody even close in age to your guy. You're a lawyer, Jacob. Anyone want to get back at you? No, but I'll check with the other partners. See if they've had anything similar happen. All right. I'll go check with your neighbors. The best I can do right now is have extra patrol cars swing by as often as they can. Thanks. Jacob. Nikki. Ooh! You going to be warm enough? Yeah. Tuck you in. Is Mister Bear watching me? He sure is sweetie. We're all watching you. Okay, love you. Love you too! Good night. Good night! Hey, you won't believe who I just saw. Yes, how did you know? I made some phone calls. She was a model prisoner. But why weren't we notified? Only the victim's family would've gotten a call. And that means Beatrice, not us. Apparently they've released her to a halfway house for the remainder of her sentence. A halfway house, where? I've got the address. Oh God... text it to me. Hi Nikki. What are you doing here? It's my turn to do dishes. What are you doing here? They assigned me here. I guess they thought it would be helpful to be near family to help with rehabilitation. You didn't suggest it? No, believe me. A place that Cali lives just a few miles from? I was the one that told you not to bring her to the prison because it would frighten her. You're her mom. I get it, believe me. And when I've done my time, I will move away and I'll leave a forwarding address and if she never wants to contact me, I'll understand. I'll keep that in mind. Great. Come on, you have a second? You want to look around? Sure. These are the snacks. Everything's free, and that's where we sleep. The drinks, which aren't free, and then this is the kitchen. So at least tell me, is she a happy kid? She's a happy little girl, everyone loves her. I'm glad to see that you're doing so good. Yeah. I heard you got out. Gunnar? Oh my God, oh my God. Oh I've missed, I've missed smelling you. Oh my God, come on... Seven years in prison is totally worth it if it means we get to be together like this. I missed you too. What's the deal with this place? I just have to put in my time, and then I'm free and clear. Speaking of which, you have to leave in like 20 minutes. Yeah, sure. They'll kick you out. But once you're free and clear, then you and me can... We can go wherever we want. We can do anything we want. What about your kid? She's with my sister. You don't have to worry about her. No, I... I've been thinking lately that, maybe she wasn't Junior's. What do you mean? I was with you a lot more during that time than I was with Junior. Are you saying she might be mine? All I can say is maybe. I don't know anything. Well no. I've been thinking lately, you know? I'm getting older. Might be nice to have someone to take to the zoo. Teach to fish. Do you mean it? Yeah. Yeah, I was wrong, Danielle. A kid should be with her mom. With you. Us. You know, maybe we could get a house somewhere. Maybe a dog. Kids love dogs, right? I want that too. I want that so much, I just had to push it down inside and pretend I didn't, because... ...because of me. I am so sorry, Danielle. I'm going to do everything I have to to make it right. Me too... Nikki? Hey! I thought this neighborhood looked familiar. Danielle, what are you doing here? All right, family meeting. Everybody on the couch. Team, here we go. Ladies, we have something very important to talk to you about. I didn't do it. Me neither. No, nobody is in trouble. I just got one mile to go. Your house looks great by the way. You just happen to be jogging by my house at the exact moment I'm outside getting my mail? I just want to see her. Aunt Danielle's out? When? Last week. She moved to a place nearby and she wants to have a visit with you. She does? Oh my God, you know it wasn't even 24 hours ago you were feeding me that bull. It wasn't bull, I meant it. I didn't contact you for seven years, and then all of a sudden you show up at my place and fill my head with thoughts of Cali. What did you expect would happen? It will be her decision. I'm just asking that you ask her. Why? I already have a mommy. Well, we're not going to do anything that you're not comfortable with. That's why we're talking. But it has to be on her terms. Of course. I need to feel her out. Well, let's see how she does at the halfway house. Give her some time and if you wanna do it, just let me know. How's that? Fine, I will ask her. Thank you! Thank you, thank you! I mean it, don't do this again, okay? You wait for me to contact you. Yeah. Hey! Hey, I thought you'd be glad to see me. I am, I just had a really hard first session, so... Well, I was hoping you'd call me back. I got tickets to the circus. Kids love the circus, right? Oh, yeah. No sure. When is it? Because... I have to call her. No, it's tonight. Tonight? Yeah? Is that a problem? We can go pick her up after school, right? Throw the ball to your friends, they're waiting. Do you know who I am? What did Nikki tell you about me? That you were in jail for a long time and before that you had a baby. Do you know who that baby is? That's me. That's right. I think about you so much, Cali. I love you so much. Hush little baby, don't say a word. Do you remember that song? I used to sing that to you all the time when you were a baby. I don't remember. I do. I used to feed you and I used to put you to bed every night. Because I was your mommy. I am your mommy! Do you want to call me mommy? Mommy. Mommy is my mommy. No! Don't you want to be with your real mommy? I mean, we could do whatever you want. Do you want to go to the circus? We could go to the circus. I have tickets, we could go. Cali, we could go to the circus right now. Do you want to come? Cali, do you want to go to the circus? Come on! I want to go back and play now. No Cali, you have to listen to me because I'm your mommy. No! What are you doing? I had her! Are you crazy? You were going to snatch and grab her off the playground in broad daylight? You're the one that said we should get her. Yeah, I thought she was going to come with us. I didn't know you had to kidnap your own kid! I almost had my baby back. All right... this look nice! For you. Thank you. Mommy? How come we're not going to the circus? That's because Becky is afraid of clowns. They're terrifying! The makeup and the weird hair... I don't know, I guess I just didn't think of it, sweetie. Why the sudden interest in the circus, Cali? My other Mommy said she'd take me. You mean your birth mother? Yeah, she said she'd take me there tonight. When did she talk to you? At school today. On the playground. Oh my God, Danielle was at the school. You saw her? Mom. I was on the playground and she talked to me. Tell me exactly what happened. Mom, don't scare her. Becky, be quiet. This is important. Go ahead and start from the beginning. Just... what did she say? She said she would take me and I would love it. I'm going to send her a letter citing the law, telling her we're not gonna call the cops yet. But if she comes within 100 feet of Cali again, we'll have no choice. Then it's on her. It won't be your fault if she screws up again. Okay? Okay. Thanks. Mommy! Do you want to play hide and seek? Cali? Cali? Cali? Mommy, come and play with me. Cali? I'm going to get you! You little stinker. Cali? Cali, where are you? Cali? I'm gonna get you! Get you! Hey! Mommy... do you remember my birthday wish? Hi! Oh, look at this one. Did you see this one? So cute! Yeah. You're in trouble now. Mom! She's so soft and warm! We could call her pancakes. Everybody loves pancakes. What do you think, mom? It was her birthday wish... Let's go home and talk about it. Talk, talk, talk. Can't we just do something? I'll take care of her, mom! Okay, look... You have school tomorrow and Jacob and I have to work. If we got the puppy tonight, who would take care of it during the day? So wouldn't it be better to get him on a weekend? When we have everything ready for him and we can research vets and dog walkers and all that stuff before we bring him home. You're kind of no fun. I know, I know. Just being a mommy. Come on you guys, say goodbye. Goodbye cuties! I mean they're pretty cute, right? You guys hungry? I'm hungry. Mom! Where's my gym bag? I don't know, where did you last see it? The car. Take this! I'm coming. Mom? Yeah? Oh, where did that come from? Mommy! Thank you! You didn't buy it? No. This is the best birthday present ever! So it's just a coincidence that the exact dog Cali was looking at last night showed up on our doorstep this morning. Oh my God, I bet she loved it! Did you take pictures? Danielle! Okay, fine. I read Jacob's letter... I never got closer than 100 feet. She didn't even see me. You were within 100 feet this morning. You left the dog on the porch! There was a door between us. Jeez, you cannot be serious. You just don't get it, do you? No, we set up rules to see if you could follow them. If you followed the rules, you would be rewarded. But... God, Danielle, every time you go out of your way to prove that you're the most selfish, untrustworthy-- What goes on in that head of yours, Danielle? I really want to know. It's not my head, it's my heart! It's my heart, Nikki! I understand, Danielle, but she doesn't want to see you. You didn't even ask her! I did! You're a liar! I want my daughter back! When I adopted Cali, let her into my heart... I made an unspoken vow to protect her no matter what. And if that means sending you to prison, that's what I'm gonna do. You ready? Yeah. All right. Grandma! Hello, sweetie. Oh look, you have a puppy! How's my girl? Good. I need to talk to your mommy. So why don't go outside and play with your puppy and I'll see you in a minute. Okay. Love you. Love you too. Bye. You hired a goon to break into my house? Mr. Holt is hardly a goon. He's a highly respected private detective. He also doubles as my driver, which is a waste of his talents, but very helpful to me. Why would you hire someone to break into my home? I thought that we had a good relationship. We do. You're a wonderful person. I always enjoy your company when you bring Cali around. Which could be a little more often, but I suppose every grandma thinks that. You know Nikki, there was a brief period of time when I actually loved your sister. Thought she'd be good for my boy. But then she exposed her true nature. She said your son was a danger to Cali. And yet she took a plea bargain. Because she's a born liar who knew the truth. And she knew that stabbing a man in the back usually doesn't make you look innocent. Why are you here, Beatrice? To see if you still have a soft spot in your heart for Danielle. No, I don't trust her one bit. And yet a moment ago it sounded as if you just might believe her story. Which is why I hired Mr. Holt. When Danielle killed my son, she ran here. When I heard she was getting out of prison, I wanted to see if you were going to take her in again. Well, I haven't. You folks put a lock on that school gate yet? More spying? For all your bluster about how you don't want her around your family, there she is, around your family. Specifically Cali. She's your sister and you're never truly going to cut her off, are you? What is this? My application with the court to take custody of Cali. You can't be serious, Cali is my daughter. Who you have endangered by allowing her to have unsupervised contact with a convicted killer. My God, Nikki, she snapped once, don't you think she could do it again? Beatrice, you're going blind, you can't take care of Cali. Macular degeneration. It limits me, but I'm not going blind. Besides, I can hire good help. My husband is a lawyer, so you won't succeed. I have lawyers too. And I just need a sympathetic judge who's more worried about the welfare of a seven year old girl than your sister's feelings. You see, dear, I'm old and I'm falling apart. And at this point in my life, the only person I care about is Cali. Then why are you trying to take her away from me? Because it's just a matter of time before somebody else does. What choice do I have, Nikki? What choice have you left me? I'm going to go play with my granddaughter for a few minutes... while I still can. Pancakes! Nikki will cause some trouble, but I'll make sure Cali knows the dog came from me. She loves the dog, she'll love me. So, I was thinking... you've still got time to do at the halfway house. Maybe I should head out to California. Get some work for a bit. I can come back when you're free and clear. Maybe you can sort things out with the kid by then. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Let's get some chips to go with this. Cash! Now! Do it! What the hell was that? Huh? And where did you get a gun? It's easy to get a gun in a house full of criminals. And that... was insurance. What are you talking about? I don't think the security cameras got a good look at my face, but you really stood out. Are you crazy? Seven years ago, you told me that we could be together if I could find a way to get rid of my husband. No, I said-- And then you said that I should dump my baby. And now you're coming back into my life and you're making a lot of promises and they are promises that you're gonna keep. Because if I have to do this alone, and I get caught, I'm gonna tell the cops exactly who did the convenience store job. We are gonna be a family with my daughter. And you're going to help me make that happen. Good. Now, my sister is becoming a problem. We have to find a way to bypass Nikki and get Cali alone. She's not wrong, you know. So she could just take Cali? No, this is a nuisance filing. She's not wrong about Danielle being a bad influence on Cali. I tried to keep her away. I did everything I could. She just sticks her nose where it's not welcome. Honey, your instincts about her are always right, but you never follow through. You want me to send her to jail? If that's what it takes, then yes. Nikki, she won't listen! She thinks she's being cute now with this dog thing. She can stay a hundred feet away, but that dog ensures that Cali is always thinking about her. We're not getting rid of the dog! That's not what I'm saying. Look, the only reason we had a creepy guy taking our picture and running around in our home is because of Danielle. Face it, if we get Danielle out of our lives, we rid ourselves of most of our problems. Oh, no, teacher, do I get a written warning now? No, that's a court order moving you to another halfway house. This is halfway across the state. How would I get to see Cali? That's the point, you can't. You got a couple days to get your things together. The van picks you up Friday, 9 a.m. sharp. If you're not ready, bad things happen for you. ...the white ball to hit the stripey ball in the pocket, okay? Hit it like that. Hey, there you go! Okay, so we need to talk about Danielle. Again? Yes. This is the last time, I promise. She is going to be moved to a different city. Far away. Why? Because she was bad, and when you're bad, there are consequences. Like when she went to jail? Exactly. We told her not to contact you and to keep away from us. And she did not follow those rules. So it's very important that if Danielle comes around, you say no and then you find daddy or Becky or me. But my other mommy is a grown up. Why does she have to follow rules? Oh, for God's sake. Your birth mom does stupid things and she's a bad influence. Becky! There, I just saved us half an hour. What is going on with you? How did I do at the science fair? That's right, you didn't even know there was a science fair. Because everything is about Cali now. That is not true! This situation affects the whole family. I liked it better when the family was just you and me. Sorry, squirt. I just... Becky... Sorry, Cali. She's a... A teenager? Yeah... yeah. Hey. I think I found a way around Nikki. Where have you been? Out. Becky... Mom, have I ever not come home? Have I ever not gotten all my homework done? Have I ever not gotten straight A's? I think you can give me some space. You hurt your sister. If you hate your stepfather... I don't hate Jacob. Then what? Jacob didn't know dad... and Cali never met dad. It's like I'm the only one who remembers him. Oh, really? And what about me? I used to hear you talk to his picture all the time. When's the last time you did? Exactly. He's been replaced in the family by someone new. If I disappeared tomorrow, would you just replace me too? Becky... Becky! Mommy? Is Danielle a bad person? I don't know if she's a bad person. But she's done some bad things. Does that mean I'll do bad things? Is that what you're worried about? That because your birth mother is one way, you're gonna be that way too? Oh, come here. Well... it is really up to you, angel. Everyone gets to make their own choices. And hopefully, I've raised you to make the right ones. Yeah? Yeah! Yeah... I think you're gonna be great. Thank you. Wait here. Hey, Becky. So awesome to run into you like this. Isn't it a beautiful day? What are you doing? I was just out for a walk, but this is great. It gives me a chance to talk. Let me guess, you want to talk about Cali? No, about you. We're family and there's so much about you I don't know. Really? Like what? ...And then your mom threw up all over the cafeteria floor. No way! Yeah. I know, little Miss Perfect, right? You know Becky, I've made a lot of stupid mistakes, but I'm not a monster. I know... It's like with the dog. I thought I'd get the dog for Cali and it would make her happy. I was just... I didn't think how that would affect you. Oh, we all love the dog. I'm glad. Is Cali doing her part? Is she walking him? Is she feeding him? Oh my gosh, she loves walking the dog. Every afternoon around dinner time, we take him to the dog park down the street for a bit. I cannot imagine your mom sitting around a dog park. She doesn't. It's usually just Cali and me. That sounds nice. A little sister alone time. Well, I should let you get back to studying. I am so glad we had a chance to talk like this. We're good to go. We can do it today. Come on, let's take Pancakes for a walk. I don't know, I'm feeling kind of sleepy. Please? Okay. Yeah! Why don't we all go? It's okay, I think we need some sister alone time. Yeah, sister alone time. Okay well, be back before dinner. And it's getting dark early, so be sure to... Yes, mom. We'll be sure to look before crossing the street. Stay close, Cali. Hey, I'm serious! Hi, Cali. Oh, hi. What's your dog's name? Pancakes... Well, you and Pancakes are going to go on a ride with me. Aunt Danielle, what're you doing? Cali! Aunt Danielle, what're you doing? Becky, help! Becky! Stop! No! Okay, tell me about the car and I can get an Amber Alert out. Becky, it's important. It's my fault. What's your fault? It's all my fault! No sweetie, it's gonna be okay. There was nothing you could do. No, you don't understand. She told me she wanted to get to know me better. I told her about how we walk the dog after dinner. I'm so sorry mom! You were right about Danielle. She's a monster. If anything happens to Cali I'll kill myself... Whoa, no no no. Don't talk like that. We're going to get Cali back. We're going to keep this family whole. Hey! Do you understand? My sister is such a tricky person. She gets people to believe her all the time. I always fall for her lies. But you, you just need to be strong right now, okay? So you can help us help your sister. Listen Becky, the first minutes are crucial. I need any information on the car so I can put out the Amber Alert. Okay. Two doors. One of those cars guys are always working on. A muscle car? Yeah. Maybe I could look at some pictures and see if I can pick it out. That would be such a big help. You're doing so good. Get me a coffee or something. It's not that kind of pit stop. How much is this? $1.29. Hush little baby, don't say a word. Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird. If that mockingbird don't sing, daddy's gonna buy you a diamond ring. If that diamond ring don't-- You... you have to be okay. You can just do this. Hey. What did you do? You were taking so long, I didn't know if you needed some help. Why haven't you done it yet? Shut up! Where's Cali? She's asleep in the car. You left her alone? You idiot! I swear she was fast asleep. Cali! Cali! Cali! How long? 14 hours. Please don't let them hurt her. Please. I promise I will do better next time. And I won't let Danielle hurt her ever again. So if you could just talk to someone up there? I'm counting on you, dad. Hey... I'm so sorry. Who is he? Did he take Cali? He's your sister's boyfriend. Look, I'm bending some rules here, but I need you to come with me. Where is she? Where is my daughter? Nikki, listen to me. Listen! We found him driving near Whitney and Main and we ran his info. His car matched the one used in a convenience store robbery. The security tape shows him and your sister leaving the scene. But it was before they took Cali. Then where the hell is my daughter? Tell her what you told me, Gunnar. I don't know. After Danielle and I picked up Cali, we drove around for awhile. We stopped to get some gas and get her some food, when we came back her and the dog were gone. Danielle and I split up and then Danielle was gone. That's it? That's all you've got? Some deadbeat who can't even keep up with a child, let alone my crazy sister? I know, but we've got an APB out on Danielle, and an Amber Alert on-- Then you've got nothing! I will continue to look for her on my own. What kind of an animal kidnaps a child like that? Danielle told me that Cali might be mine. Really? Did you get any proof? Yeah, that's what I thought. She played you. Danielle was right. Cali belongs with her real mom. That's right you bastard. I'm right here. Should we go to the store where she disappeared? Look around? They've already got a lot of people doing that. We should go back to the house in case Danielle calls. No, she would call me on my cell. Then we should go search. I hate to say this, but I really think we need to change our approach and try something different. The silver car. He followed Danielle everywhere. Who followed Danielle? The guy who was in our house. He drove a silver car just like that one. I don't understand. Beatrice knew Danielle's every move. Knew that she saw Cali at school that day because she hired him to follow her. So? So, when was the last time that you looked into the backseat of someone's car when you passed by? Never. So whoever took Cali must have known that she was in the car. It wasn't just some random stranger. You think he managed to track Danielle? Yes and I think he waited for his chance to grab her. It's a long shot. But we've got to take it, right? Yeah, let's go. If I'm not back in three minutes, come in, call the cops. Okay. I miss my mommy. Oh honey, I know. I know you do. I'm right here, sweetie. Mommy? It's okay, Cali. We're going to be leaving in a few moments. I don't think so, dear. I came here alone so we could do this quietly and not upset my daughter. But if I'm not back in a few minutes, my husband's gonna call the police. Despite my warnings, you let Danielle walk right up to Cali and kidnap her. The only kidnappers are you two. We rescued her from a dangerous situation and we're not going to return her to a mother that leaves her constantly unattended. You must have put a tracking device on Gunnar's car, that's how you followed them. Pretty sure that's illegal. Do you want the cops finding out? Let the police come. I'm sure they and the press would be more interested to hear the story of Mr. Holt's dramatic rescue of a neglected little girl. I understand why you did this, to a point. But if you don't let go of my daughter, I'm going to beat you silly. You are trespassing on private property and you just threatened the owner of that property. I am well within my rights to keep you from harming her. Now leave. Now you're assaulting me? I'm not afraid of you anymore. Run to your mother. Mommy! Cali, get back here! Cali, run to the street. Daddy and Becky are waiting for you, okay? Get off me! I'm not going to let you hurt my daughter! She'll never be your daughter! Cali... It's a letter from your birth mother. Look... I'm in a tough position here. I don't want my sister to have a bad influence on you. That's why I sent her to prison. But if getting a letter from her makes you angry or shut the world out, I think she's still having a bad influence on you. She tried to steal me from you and daddy. Yes. She is not a good person. This is really hard to explain. If somebody is sick, we don't blame them for being sick, right? That would be mean. We just hope that they get better. It's kind of like your birth mother is sick. So she'll get better some day? No sweetie, I don't think so. Look, you don't have to love her. Maybe you don't have to even like her. But I think it's really important that you don't hate her. I don't want to read it. Yet. That's my girl. I'm so proud of you. I'll save this for later, when you're ready. Hey! Hey, all right...
