Subtitle by Ram-Sita What do you like about that boy? He understands me. So you had a heart attack. You had a very bad blockage with a clot in the artery on the side of your heart. Very dangerous. We sucked it out, put stents in that area, and that was a year ago. Right. So since the last time I saw you, what have you noticed in terms of... how you feeling? You know, my... routine has not changed. Miguel! I'm probably busier than I was before the heart attack. Make sure you vote for Letitia James for attorney general. And traveling much more than I used to. This is too fast. How's your mental health? My dad's worked in politics and been the most efficient guy in the room his entire career. It felt like the whole thing was a test for this. - Last question. - Last question? But other than that, I have been feeling... - Tired. A lot. Yeah, 'cause I sleep little. - Exhausted a lot. - So... And what time do you usually go to bed, and what time do you wake up? I go to bed around midnight. I get up around 5:30, quarter to six, so I'm sleeping, like, 5 1/2 hours, which is a little more than I used to sleep. I didn't hear about my father's heart attack until it was almost over. I was in London with my family, and... my dad called me, I think from the hospital bed, and said, "I'm having a... I had a... I had a little of a heart attack." And really downplayed it. I didn't realize sort of how serious it was until later. That's pretty Luis Miranda, honestly. He manages the pain, and he keeps moving, because he's just a relentless motherfucker, and so it's all about, "All right, how can I get this part handled so I can keep going?" It's not like you're there for the plot. Right, right, right. - You know what? You could use a break. You have been going nonstop for so long, Luis. - I mean, really. - Nonstop. Where's my wife? Right here. The way my father and I work together is collaborative. We sort of start with whatever creative work I'm doing, and then we find ways to link it to the world at large. He's become a gatekeeper for me in a very real way, which is not ever how I anticipated our relationship. I guess I gotta grow my hair back? It'll percolate. Anyway... So they spend in Puerto Rico and they come here and they fly here and they spend money in the island. What? Okay, that's disrespectful. The more things change, the more things stay the same. When these kids rushed to the stage, it reminded me of the many crazy things that I did when I was in that same university. Classes were suspended at the University of Puerto Rico after a riot last night in which a 21-year-old girl was shot to death and 50 people were injured. The riot grew out of a protest against the ROTC. When I studied in the University of Puerto Rico in the '70s, it was a volatile time. I participated in the protest movement. There were always reasons to protest, no different from now. Our island is complicated. We were a Spanish colony until the United States acquired us in 1898, after war, when we became a U.S. territory and continued to be a colony. Congress made us citizens, but we don't have the same rights as our fellow Americans. We can fight in wars, but we can't vote in presidential elections, and we don't have representatives in Congress. It's like a two-hour flight to Miami gives you rights that you don't have in Puerto Rico. We've suffered through failed leadership that left us straddled with debt. And our president throws fucking paper towels at us when we get hammered by Hurricane Maria. But you don't choose where you're from. Where are you from? I am from Puerto Rico. A little town called Vega Alta. It's a small town. Nobody had any money, but they were... a very scholarly, known family in the island. All they wanted me was to do well in school. My mother pushed my limits to no end. Like, a 95 was unacceptable, and I would bring a 95 to the house, and the first question she will ask would be, "Did anybody get 100?" I was like, "No, I was the highest grade!" "Well, you'll have to do a little better next time." I was like, "Thank you very much, Mom." I used to go to the movies every Sunday. One day, my father took me to see. "The Unsinkable Molly Brown." - You're tuckered, Molly. Why don't you quit? Sure, I'm tuckered, and I might give out, but I won't give in! How could anybody say I'm down? Look! I'm blinkin'! When I saw the movie, I was just fascinated. In the one hand, it had a bit... of my own fantasy, of my own story, of a little kid in some town that sort of made it big. What was captivating was the drive that this woman had. And I sort of identified with that drive. There's something about that moment, I think. The notion that he saw a life for himself that was bigger than Puerto Rico. And, you know, you can trace it to Debbie Reynolds singing in "The Unsinkable Molly Brown," "I'm not worried about down, I'm going up." You know, he who had these huge dreams. I think he's raised on a steady diet of American bootstrap narratives. I was gonna study law at the University of Puerto Rico. That's what I had decided I was gonna do. NYU was recruiting Puerto Ricans in the island, but for the psychology PhD program, and I said, "What the heck." So I went. I was interviewed. I then got the letter of acceptance. Classes were starting in September. I had been married for a number of months to my seventh-grade sweetheart. I had an apartment. I had a car. I had a wife. I was 18 years old, but I had all of this other stuff that older people had, and I realize, that's not what I wanted my life to be. And got in a plane and left. In my head, I kept playing. "The Way We Were." That day was just very, very sad. Got divorced shortly after. I always saw this not as a permanent move, but as a step in what I wanted to do next. It was a different time. It was a different experience. It was, I think, the same DNA that connects all of us who come from Puerto Rico, particularly of a certain age. We share an experience. It's one of family, it's one of trying to do better, and it's one of exploring this other place that they call Nueva York. It is a real task to reconcile that place that you left in Puerto Rico with this place of skyscrapers and people speaking a different language and not very much support system outside of your family. I'd just arrived in New York. I was living with my aunt. I don't recall culture shock. I do recall discrimination. Every day, I wrote two or three letters to people in Puerto Rico, and I would go to the post office to get packages that my mother would send to me. I have been in New York a couple of months, and the guy looks at me, and he says, "I'm Miranda too. But not of your kind." And I'm like... I didn't get what he meant until much later. It was like, "Oh, he was Italian American, not Latino or Puerto Rican." Not everyone wanted us here. We couldn't get the same jobs. It was hard to find housing. It didn't matter if you were a janitor or a PhD student. What they saw was Puerto Rican, some brown person, some brown kid, not a real American. It motivated me. I always want to right a wrong. And when I got to NYU, I realized that minority students had fought hard to create a diverse student body, particularly at a time when affirmative action was under attack. So I immediately saw it as my responsibility to join that fight, to join that struggle, and make sure that the class behind me was as diverse as mine was. I applied to NYU, and they had student interviews, and Luis was supposed to be part of mine, but he arrived very late. He came in... I mean, this is the '70s... Long hair, jeans, talking very excited about this protest. I can remember thinking to myself, "Oh, this guy's very interesting." Our first date was April 22nd. I know exactly the date. We went to see Haciendo Punto en Otro Son, which was this great Puerto Rico band. And then we went dancing at El Corso, which was this fabulous dance room on 86th Street. The other thing that was just extraordinary about Luis was, I was a single mom, and I was a package deal. Lucecita was 4 at the time, and every day, he would ask if he could stay, and she would give him her permission to stay. And within a week of Luis being in our house, she says to him, "I've never had a daddy like you're a daddy to me." In May, he says he wants to get married the next month. And I'm like, "Well, kinda... That's a little fast for me." So we get married in September. Cita's adopted by him by November. I mean, we fast-tracked this whole thing. And Lin-Manuel was born a couple of years later. Luz and I... We were very much involved empowering parents in Washington Heights. Trying to build more schools, of trying to gain consciousness of an immigrant population that was totally disenfranchised, and came in contact with political people. Someone told me to apply to this special advisor position for Hispanics for Ed Koch. In the past, the city was a pushover. In the past, these same hired guns gave away the city. You have to understand, it makes no difference at all whether you shout or not. It doesn't move me. It doesn't change me. Mr. Koch, I must say you are full of shit. If you don't wanna hear me, we won't discuss it. And I remember in that first interview raising with the mayor several things that I did not agree with. You're in an interview to get a job, "I don't agree with you on this and I don't agree"... Pair of balls. And the mayor said to me, "Listen... "if you agree with me "in six out of every ten things, "and then in those other four things, "you shut your mouth, we'll be in a good place." He came there to be the head of Latino affairs for Mayor Koch. He took what had been a token position and turned it into a real position with access and influence, and he became one of Koch's top advisors and one of the folks that Koch really relied on and trusted, especially during the stress of a campaign. I think Koch loved him because he was authentic and he was as brash as Koch was. I was in the administration already. I was in a leadership training program, and there is this obnoxious... leader who wouldn't stop. You would say something, respond to his question, and he was never satisfied, and he would just get more and more irate and belligerent, and so we finished the session. I said, "Who was that asshole?" I think part of the reason why Koch liked him is because he was a Puerto Rican version of Koch. There's a bluntness about Luis. He can be absolutely unsparing in his criticisms of the people that he's trying to bring together. He doesn't pull any punches, and I think Koch probably appreciated that. You know, I am not someone who turns the other cheek if you hit me, right? I hit back. Also, one of the things that Luis was able to do at a critical moment during the Koch years was to recognize that the story of New York by the 1980s wasn't just going to be a Puerto Rican story. I knew in my position that Puerto Ricans were the largest numbers of Latinos and the one that voted, but I began to see the large numbers of Dominicans, of Colombians, of Ecuadorians that were moving into the city, and then President Reagan approved the amnesty law. President Reagan today signed a massive immigration reform law. The new law grants amnesty to illegal aliens who lived here before 1982. I saw that as an incredible opportunity to reach out to other Latinos to open government to them. What he did was quite innovative. He used the power of the numbers by doing research. How many were registered? How many were voting? And then transferring that data into action to say to elected officials, "This is a growing population "that not only are your constituents. "We are here, and we're gonna stay here, and we intend to flex our political muscle." There's an indispensable person in our community. I nominate Luis Miranda. Sorry, Ed, I can't produce the show tonight. No. Okay. Luis has this talent of bringing people together. He also has a gift for fundraising, which is not unimportant. I always thought about my next step, and now that I have been in this Latino lane and have pretty good connections in government, in the nonprofit sector, it's probably a good moment to move into doing my own thing. When I became elected and when I emerge as member of the DNC and all this stuff, Luis was my Sancho Panza. Let's put it that way. But Luis was always the guy telling me, "This is measurable. "These are the things that are right. These are the things that are wrong." Roberto came to me and said, "I met with this guy who's running for the Senate. "His name is Chuck Schumer, "and I think it's a good campaign for you to begin to do some work." Next... what is it... senator? Your mouth to God's ears. Congressman Charles Schumer has his sights on the U.S. Senate. Tonight, Schumer is officially in the race and faces a tough fight ahead. The only real thing that I learned in my psych PhD was statistics, so I told him, "I wanna see a poll." He was, like, 5%. So I remember going to Roberto and saying, "Dude, I wanted to go into politics, "but I don't wanna start my career with this guy who has not a prayer." Then I met with Chuck Schumer, and I was fascinated by his energy. Atta-baby! He was a good fundraiser, and he was relentless in his conviction that he could do the job. So I took on the job doing the Latino part of the campaign. When Luis came on the scene, there was a Latino community that was basically not organized. They didn't have many elected officials, they didn't have people in positions of power, and Luis knew how to take the large numbers of Hispanics, but more importantly, the needs and channel it into organizations that were powerful and had effect, and you knew as a political leader, when Luis asked for something, people were gonna listen. I ran against Al D'Amato. He was a giant of the Senate, conservative Republican, and no one thought I could beat him. And Luz was like, "Alfonse D'Amato is a good guy. "Every time we have a problem, I call his office, and they fix it." I'm like, "Not even my wife is in favor of my candidate." When he took on the Schumer race, this was a difficult race. You know, in some ways, it was a bit of a suicide mission. The Spanish campaign I did was based on a slogan: "No te vistas que no vas." And it was the motto, "Don't think that you're going places. You are not, and we're gonna stop you." We got overwhelming support in the Latino community, and then... I'm Chuck Schumer, the next senator of New York. He became the senator. And here comes Hillary Clinton. She wants to run for the Senate. I am honored today to announce my candidacy for the United States Senate from New York. I get approached to work with her campaign. So now, you know, in a couple of years, we have the two senators from the state of New York as part of our portfolio. Now Congressman Adriano Espaillat, Mayor de Blasio, Tish James, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. How he evolved in terms of identity politics, Luis became a political consultant that was able to provide advice and shape a message beyond the Latino community. It's wild here, because we have a year ahead with the appropriations bill, with the farm bill... As political operatives, there weren't too many that were Latino that crossed over. Luis mainstreamed. Latino politics and Latino culture in New York in a very, very different way than anybody that I've known has done. - Luis Miranda. Hi. How are you? As the hurricane kept getting closer and closer to Puerto Rico, I got a huge knot in the pit of my stomach. With these winds of 165, that would make this the strongest hurricane in history to make landfall. The winds are ferocious right now, gusting above 120 miles per hour, severing the tops of the palm trees and ripping off the boarding that's on buildings. Ugh. Hurricane Maria flattened Puerto Rico. My family lives in the hills of Maricao in Vega Alta. There was many days of radio silence. You know, every cell tower was out, electricity was gone. For me, Puerto Rico, it's... it's this untouchable... Perfect place that all of a sudden doesn't exist anymore. So doing everything we can becomes the job. I was able to open an account where we could send some money there, and then I just talked to my brother, 'cause at the end of the day, I trust my brother. Right. He's actually driving the truck. Our response to Puerto Rico was immediate. I began writing right away, because that's my natural response to everything was, "Okay", "let me write a song, and we'll just start raising money." Alex, we got a lot of song left. I know, but we need to get this right. This was even before anyone from the administration had weighed in, before we had heard anything from the island. I started writing "Almost Like Praying." And realizing, "Okay, we've gotta get every Latino we know involved," and getting yeses before I'd finished writing the track. And then my father on the logistics front. We begin at 2:00 in Miami. Figure out every Latin artist involved, and he figured out, "Okay, we've gotta fly to LA and we've gotta fly to Miami," and solving that equation to get that done as quickly as possible. Great. Let's have a separate conversation on that. Can we work simultaneously rather than sequentially? Hey. Hi. We raised about $20 million for the Hispanic Federation. That's all in over 100,000 small donations. That's not corporations. That's people sending 5 bucks and 10 bucks and lemonade stands and breaking their piggy banks. So it would be... I'm the only who really had a full life in Puerto Rico, so to realize that it was important to all of my family to be part of the effort to rebuild the island has been the most wonderful discovery. I think the most important thing Luis has done is been an amazing dad who conveyed to his children the importance of family. That was always first and foremost for him. There's probably gonna be a fundraiser in Miami for Latino Victory Fund... - When I'm there? - While you're in Miami. Of course there is! So I would want you and your husband to go. He has all these ideas and is constantly, constantly just coming up with things that he thinks are great ideas. Most of the time, they end up being, you know, even if at the very beginning, we're like, "No, that's never gonna work. That's not a good idea." My daughter... She was great at math, so I sort of pushed her into engineering and finance. If we're the Corleones, my sister is Michael. I'm Sonny. I'm too hotheaded. Hopefully none of us is Fredo. She's the one who can actually really work with him. They work really well together, and they have for a really long time. I worked for him for a few summers, and they always ended in screaming matches, because for better or worse, I cannot get myself to care about things I don't care about, and so I kept getting knocked off important jobs to less important jobs until I was just doing data entry and listening to music, and that was about the only way in which I could work for my father. Lin-Manuel was the artistic child. That was his lane, and supporting him was always important to me. I never really talked to my dad about his decision to leave Puerto Rico until I sort of faced a similar crossroads in my own life. My first regular job out of college was teaching at my old high school. I taught seventh-grade English, I advised theater, and I loved it. I mean, that's the secret. I really enjoyed it. And I got offered a full-time position at the end of my first year, and I actually wrote my dad and said, "I don't know what to do. "'In the Heights' is moving, "I have collaborators I like, "but who knows if that's really gonna go? "Should I take the full-time job "and devote more time to teaching, "or should I work and really devote myself to writing full-time?" He wrote me this long letter back, and he goes, "I want what's best for you. "I want you to be able to pay your rent. "I want you to be "a self-sufficient, functioning adult, "so I really wanna tell you to teach, "but then I would be ignoring my own life "and my own gut "and what led me to be here and meet your mother "and take care of you and Lucecita, so you have to follow your gut." I thought "In the Heights" was great. I loved the student production that Lin-Manuel did at Wesleyan. But it could have sucked, and it didn't matter to me. I was gonna do everything I could to help my son be successful. I remember going to Ken Sunshine, who I knew from our days in politics, and I knew he was a bigshot with the stars, and sort of going to him and said, "Hey", "I have this kid who's nobody, "but he's very talented, "and I know he's gonna go places, but he needs someone like you." Luis did mention to me, "I have this son who loves music and theater, and you're sort of in that world, right, Kenny?" 'Cause I don't think he knew too many people in that world, even though he personally had this love. I do the same thing with anybody. As talented or as not talented as they may be, follow your dream, you know? It's a very tough business. It is... the chances of making it are really slight, but follow your dream and... I think at some point I said to Lin-Manuel, and I said to Luis, "You know, you can't make any money in this. "You know, nobody makes any money "in the entertainment... Particularly in the theater world." Five, six, a-five, six, seven, eight. We opened "In the Heights" in an off-Broadway theater that we owned in 2007, and not many people knew about "In the Heights" yet. It was hard to sell tickets for that show that didn't have any brand recognition, that didn't have any stars in it, that received warm reviews but not over-the-top reviews, and Luis just jumped in and started selling groups and helping us to unlock the communities that don't often go to the theater that we all knew would love "In the Heights." Then it was using my contacts to sell tickets. So my job became just to get the word out that my kid had this play off-Broadway. What he saw very early on is that politics and entertainment are very similar in one respect, particularly Broadway. You're trying to convince a lot of people to spend money they're not getting back, whether that's raising money for a political candidate or investing in a Broadway show. So "In the Heights," successful off-Broadway, goes to Broadway. I think Luis and I helped run the campaign for the Tony like a political campaign. And I remember all of us saying, "Okay." "We have to..." "Be in sort of, like, white mode. "You applaud like this. "You don't go, 'Ah!' That is very, very not cool." And the Tony Award for Best Score, which I already opened, goes to... "In the Heights." Music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda. And the winner... The 2008 Tony Award goes to... "In the Heights." - We were all hillbillies. We were all screaming. I could hear my sister, who was in first row mezzanine. Thank you. Lin-Manuel had won the Tony for "In the Heights," and my friend called me and said, "Do you think that Lin-Manuel can come to White House and do one of the 'In the Heights' numbers?" And Lin-Manuel says, "Ah, yeah, of course, that'd be cool, "but do you think they will let me do something else?" My God. I'm thrilled the White House called me tonight because I'm actually working on a hip-hop album. It's a concept album about the life of someone I think embodies hip-hop, Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. Artists reflect the world they live in. So as "Hamilton" was developing... I was always curious to know, how much of Luis is in the role of Alexander Hamilton? The main gift of Ron Chernow's biography is, he always frames him within his relentlessness, and that's what I keyed in on. That notion of, "All right, what else do I have to do?" "All right, what else do I have to do? All right, what else can I be doing?" I mean, that is Luis Miranda as much as it is Alexander Hamilton. I didn't have to look any farther than the tree from the apple. When I was playing Hamilton, I was just playing my father. I don't think anybody's ever seen a meteoric success story as rapidly as it happened around "Hamilton." Thank you. So as soon as we realized. "Hamilton" was gonna be a success, I knew I wanted to bring "Hamilton" to Puerto Rico, and so with Hurricane Maria, the only thing that changed was the timetable of our announcement. Thank you, Luis. In January of 2019, we will welcome a brand-new production of "Hamilton" to Teatro U.P. And we will also be here to raise money for the rebuilding of the island and for the rebuilding of the arts on the island. Listen, Puerto Rico's gotta be open for business, so let's plant the biggest flag we can and say, "Hey, 'Hamilton's' coming to Puerto Rico, and the original star's gonna be in it." Thanks. And our hope is to raise a lot of money for Puerto Rico with this, for arts funding, for the university itself. That's disrespectful. Protestors came onstage because we had been very active in Congress passing something to help... To allow Puerto Rico to file for bankruptcy, and you know what? Valid point, because what happened as a result of that was the formation of the PROMESA board, which basically asked for austerity, and most of the cuts came at the expense of the University of Puerto Rico, and that was devastating as the education of lots of kids. And I hate that, but I have to live with it. The island was saddled with billions of dollars in debt and didn't have the tools to manage the debt. Right? Why? Because it couldn't declare bankruptcy. It couldn't do what other municipalities, for example, in the United States, had done. The decision to get behind this particular political solution is not an easy one. PROMESA ought to be criticized. The piece is complicated, right, because the problem isn't PROMESA. The problem is American colonialism. Hey, guys, listen. Can we do that? Do that? Hey. Hey, guys. Guys, guys. I don't have any outside agenda other than to make art and make Puerto Rico proud. That's all I've ever wanted to do. Hi, honey. Thanks, baby. Morning. My daily coffee. Dude. Time to get up. Puerto Rican breakfast. Hot dog with eggs. Luis can't help but become very powerfully attached to whoever is in his life. Miguel? How are we doing? Miguel came into Luis's life... Come, there's hot breakfast. At a point where I think he was beginning to feel old. And Miguel renewed his youth. It was like, now he was a dad again, because he's been his legal guardian from the time Miguel was a baby. You need to shave. I know. I keep forgetting. My mother was in a very, very bad situation, and Luis and his wife Luz... They asked her if she wanted to move in with them. My mother was pregnant with me when all that happened. They basically saved her life. And that's why I'm here. I have midterms next week. I am terrified for the first two. Physics? Physics and history. Miguel comes from a lineage of difficulty. My brother has ADHD, all his kids have ADHD, Miguel's mom has ADHD, and he had ADHD and then sensory issues. Tell me next week's order of tests. On Monday, I have... - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - Okay. Monday, you have... Science and then history. - The same day? - Yeah. They redid the schedule, so that way we now have two exams a day. It's really not fun. - Okay. Then on the 18th? I have math and English. And so Luis has shepherded this kid who had very special needs from the time he was an infant, got him into a special needs school, and then has worked in guiding his education and care to the point where this kid has now been on high honors in a mainstream school for the last three years. You may get the letter. Or email. You get an email, I probably get CC'd. Just finished the college application process. Waiting for the letter just... Is just not fun. It's just super stressful 'cause you're waiting to hear from a college you wanna go to the most. And the anxiety is there. What am I going to do if I don't get in? Huh? Let me see what my life is like today. Probably busy. So Manuel is picking you up at 3:15. - Mm-hmm. - He's gonna bring you home. - He's gonna wait for you. - Do you have a key? No, Titi. We've been through this. I lost it. Okay, then I'll have to give you my key. Yeah, because there's nobody in the house when he gets to the house. - Correct. - Yeah, can we handle that? Because all you do is complain, but you don't do anything affirmatively to get a fucking key. All I know is that, like, my entire life, he's been a constant. For everything that I've gone through, everything that I've done, everything that I've... Like, all of the major things that have happened in my life, he's been there. - Bye, honey. Have a good day. I could never repay him for the fact that he... Treats me like one of his own, for the fact that he considers me his son. Like, you can't repay someone that. Not... all the money in the world would not be enough to, like, fully... To, like, truly thank him for that. We are in the theater of University of Puerto Rico. This is a special place. This is a theater that, for everybody that went to the University of Puerto Rico, have a magic, you know? And it's beautiful. It's the most beautiful theater in Puerto Rico. No doubt about it. After the hurricane, Luis asked me, "Ender, what do you think bringing 'Hamilton' here?" And I said, "You gotta think about it twice", "because this theater is damaged. So how do you wanna do it?" He said, "Yeah, but that's the point. We wanna help to fix the theater." "Hamilton" go to UPR. Yeah. It is election day. Republicans and Democrats have made their final case to voters. Now, for many of you, time to hit the polls. And it goes almost without saying, but I'm gonna say it anyway. The stakes are high for both parties, as Republicans look to hold on to their House and Senate majorities and the Democrats make the case that they are a necessary check on President Trump's agenda. Together, we make one. Her right leg, it's busted. My left leg... Left leg is busted. Together, we voted for two Democrats. For the first couple of years I was here, I was still a registered voter in Puerto Rico, and that mattered more to me. Once I realized that this is where I was gonna spend my life, I registered here, realized that it's really up to Puerto Ricans... On the island to decide their political future. Tish James. It's my last big local election. I'm falling into pieces. Oh, my goodness. For Tish, I was on the day-to-day for fundraising. That's sort of the piece that I took over. Then how to spend that money and the commercials and the imaging and all of that. Certainly this is the last time I'm doing that. My name is Letitia James, and I'm the public advocate of the city of New York, and I wanted to come by to say, thank all of you for voting. So make sure you look at everything in that ballot, and, of course, make sure you vote for Letitia James for attorney general. For many, many years, I was the political operator. Bye. No press conference. When you're the political operator, today is the busiest day. You sort of worked and worked and worked for D-Day, which would've been today. Now, being older and not being the person who's in charge of the day-to-day, but being the political consultant, a day like today, you're just basically getting reports of what's happening in the field. Ugh, God. - I know. I know. I know. As my dad used to say in Spanish, "Life is like a shit sandwich, and sometimes you really bite into it." Electing a Democratic Congress became the goal of 2018. Now I can do this. Not my president. Defeating this motherfucker in the White House has to be a call for action. We really worked hard to support Latino candidates in Georgia. Going door to door in Gainesville. It's a lot of distance between the houses here. Knocking on doors. Knocking on doors for Stacey Abrams. So that we can increase Latino turnout for the entire Democratic ticket, which will include Stacey Abrams. Same thing in Florida. Thank you for everything that you've done. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. I have now been going to Florida every two or three weeks for the last several months, making sure that we energize Puerto Ricans, because so many Puerto Ricans were moving in after Hurricane Maria, leaving the island as climate refugees. If anything has come out of Hurricane Maria, it's that it has brought together... Our allies in the United States with Puerto Rico. And now, together, we cannot be stopped. They're living in a hotel, they're looking for a place or looking for jobs, they're looking for schools for their kids, and on top of that, we're telling them, "Oh, shit, and this is a historical election, and you got to be involved." We ended up in North Carolina, we ended up in Pennsylvania, just following the migration and how we could be helpful, and at the end of the day, for me, it always ties in to politics. If you elect the people who represent you, you have a stake as to what they're gonna do. Okay. I refreshed it. Let's go to Univision now. Hi. Thank you. Unfortunately, the Blue Wave is not... - It's not happening. - It's not happening. - Not yet. - It's scary. And it looks like Gillum and Stacey... Are not gonna make it. Ay-yi-yi. 1.2 million for us. - And we're at what? 32. Almost 32% reporting. - It's official. - They called it. - Way to go. - Attorney general elect! They called it. - Let me see. - No kisses. - None. - She is ready to go. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor and it is my privilege to bring to you the next attorney general for the state of New York, Letitia James. Luis will often minimize issues around his health. I'm worried about the stress. And I don't see an end to his exhaustion. He needs to get more rest. Since this heart attack, I'll tell him... "I don't wanna be a widow. "What would my life be like without you? And there isn't another you to replace you." I got a text that there is 100 people online at 4:57 a.m. Morning. Gracias. Café? Café. Whoo! We got our tickets. It was worth the wait. "You have to reduce your stress." - Breathe. Start breathing. "Open Breathe app now." Okay. I come back tomorrow, and tomorrow is the last show, but I leave at 1:00 and... Right, right, right. Say hello to Ender. - Bro. - Hi, Ender. It's been crazy, but... Luis Miranda is 24/7. Sometime, he call me at 1:00 a.m. and he say, "You have five minutes to talk?" "Yes," but, I mean, it's 2:00 in the morning and he's still texting me. Subtitle by Ram-Sita
