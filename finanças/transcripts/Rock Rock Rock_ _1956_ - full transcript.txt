Well, I have to go. I have to take care of my kid sister. Remember what I told you about you know who. The school paper's got these announcements today. Have you seen them? Are you going to enter it? Why don't you enter, too? Oh, I'd never win. I think you would. Hello, Dori. Hello, Gloria. Oh, Gloria, this is Tommy. Tommy, Gloria. Hi, Gloria. Hello, Tommy. Ah, see you later. Who's she? Her name's Gloria Barker. She's new in town. Well, I have to go now. Aren't you going to walk me home? Oh, sure. Say, I almost forget to tell ya. Be sure and watch Alan Freed's television program tomorrow night. I never miss it. What's going to be on tomorrow night? A surprise. What kind of a surprise? Just watch it and see. I'll ask Arabella to come over my house. We'll see it together. Hello, Gloria. God, what a day I've had. I went to the dress shop this morning to order a new evening dress for the dance. You're going to wear an evening dress to the dance? Strapless, blue, strapless, blue. A friend of yours told me it his favorite color. Well, so long. Gosh, if she's going to get one, I'm going to get one, too. I think you oughta have one. I think you oughta have all the things your heart needs, and I wish I could give them to ya.

It's for me. Hello, Arabella. What are you doing this beautiful Saturday afternoon? My mother's going shopping, and I have to take care of my little sister, so I'm taking her to the movies. You wanna go? Gosh, I'd like to, but I haven't got any M-O-N-E-Y. [Arabella] What? I used up my allowance for this week. Oh, and I only have enough for me and the B-R-A-T. Mm, ow. I tell ya what, I'll meet you on the terrace at the country club in half an hour. I have a plan, goodbye. Father, give me a dollar, quick. I have to go somewhere. Okay, where do you have to go? - To the movies. - Oh. Just a minute, young lady. Stay right there. You mean to say you haven't any money left from your allowance? I didn't mean to tell you. I just found out anyway. I thought you were gonna keep a budget? I did, but it didn't stay kept. May I see it? Uh-huh, ice cream, candy, magazines, jukebox, forty cents, E.P., sixty cents. E.P., what's that? Elvis Presley. I still say, what's that? Father, you're sweet but so square. I played Elvis Presley records on the jukebox. You already have an item down here for playing the jukebox. Why don't you put 'em both together? Oh, it would look like I spent too much money for just one thing. That is dishonest. Why, why in business, that's like keeping two sets of books. Is that bad? Bad, it's illegal. They put men in jail for that. Oh, well, I have to go meet Arabella now. Thanks for the movie money. Ah, you're welcome. Now wait a minute. Wait a minute, I didn't give... Louise? Louise? What's the matter? It's that daughter of yours. Louise, there hasn't been one week that she hasn't run out of her allowance. She has no idea of the value of money. Look at this, look, wait. Look, bills, bills, nothing but bills. Bills for clothes, bills for hats, bills for all sorts of things. Louise, we've gotta teach that girl that money doesn't grow on fathers. Now, first thing Monday morning, I'm gonna go right down, and cancel everyone of our charge accounts. But supposing she needs some new clothes? Nope, Dori's not gonna get one new thing. (birds chirping) - Hi. - Hi, Dori. Hi, baby. Hello. Where you waiting long? Just a few minutes. Ready to go? I am, but this one... Don't you wanna go to the movies? No. You wanna a little doll? - No. - Don't you want a storybook? No. - Do you want blocks? - No. Well then, what do you want? I know what she wants, come on.

Hmm, now that he's won the contest... That Gloria will want him more than ever. And she's going to wear an evening dress to the dance. A blue evening dress. And strapless. There's just one thing to do. I'll go down to the dress shop tomorrow and get one, too. But please, Miss Silky. Now girls, you'll just have to wait, and I'll take care of you one at a time. I have a customer in the fitting room right now, and I'll be out as soon as I'm finished with her. Come along. You're next, aren't you? [Dori] Uh-huh. It seems like everybody wants an evening dress since they know that Gloria was going to get one. Ah, I wish I had someone to wear an evening dress for. Oh, you'll meet him someday. Just like that, you'll see. I don't know. Sometimes I think I'll never meet him. Pardon me, could you tell me where the proprietress is? Miss Silky's in the back. That's him. I know that's him. Who? My dream man. His name is Melville. Melville. He's in my French class. - He is? - Uh-huh. And I had to take Spanish. Oh, Melville, I'd like you to meet Arabella. Arabella, Melville. Pleased to meet you. Why didn't you say something? He's beautiful. Now Dori, what can I do for you? I'd like to get an evening dress. There's a nice one in the window for $30.00. The blue one. And are you going to pay for it now? Why, no, I'm going to charge it like I always do. And haven't you heard? What? Your father closed your charge account this morning. He did? I'm sorry. Gosh. Are the dishes done already? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Dori helped me. Dori did? That's strange. I thought so, too. She's taking an awfully long time. I hope she's doing them right. Dori doing the dishes? Comfy? Oh, sure. Dori? Yes, Father? Is there something on your mind? As a matter of fact, there is. You see, Father, I went to the dress shop today, and Miss Silky told me that we didn't have a charge account there anymore and, well I've just have to get an evening dress for the prom. An evening dress, huh? I saw a beautiful one there for only $30.00. Only $30.00? Do you realize, young lady, how difficult it is to earn $30.00? I know, but I need this dress so badly. Well, when is this dance of yours? Two weeks from Saturday. When's the latest you can order the dress? Oh, about three days before the dance, why? Well, I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do with ya. Now the dress is $30.00, huh? Alright, I'll give $15.00, if you earn the other 15. Oh. Maybe when you find out how difficult it is to earn money, then you'll spend it a little less freely. Where am I going to get $15.00? (birds chirping) Well, Dori Graham, how are you? Very well, thank you, Mr. Bimble. Ah, sit down. Well now Dori, how can I help you? I'd like to borrow some money. What? Well, isn't that what banks are for? Well, yes, true, but we don't lend money without business references, collateral. What's collateral? Collateral, well that's something that people pledge that's worth as much as the amount of money we lend them. When someone puts money in your bank, what do you do with it? Well, I don't really know. You mean to tell me, Mr. Bimble, that you take people's money and don't know what you do with it? Well, of course I know what we do with it. What I mean there is that I don't know where any particular deposit goes. You mean, the deposits are all mixed up? No, no, no. They're kept in order by bookkeeping. Double-entry bookkeeping. You keep two sets of books? I do not keep two sets, I... Oh, Dori Graham, let... When depositors put money in your bank, where do you get the money to pay in interest? Well, ah, the bank makes its money by giving loans to responsible people who have collateral, and charging interest on the loans. How much interest do you charge? 6%. That's awfully high, isn't it? 6% interest is standard. - It is? - Yes. Seems awfully high to me. Suppose some person came along, and charged less interest than you do. Well, I'd bet pretty soon, they'd take all your business away from you, wouldn't he? Mr. Bimble, you've given me something more valuable than money. You've given me knowledge. Thank you, Mr. Bimble. (birds chirping) Arabella, how would you like to be wallowing... Arabella, how would you like to be wallowing in money? Huh? I just thought of the most wonderful way to make money to pay for my evening dress. I'm going to be a banker. You? Sure, I'm going to lend money and get interest on it. Where will you get the money? That's where you can help me. All I've got in the world is $15.00, and that's in Mr. Bimble's bank. Oh, but that's terrible. You'll have to get it out right away. They're dishonest. How do ya know? They keep two sets of books and that's a government offense. My father told me so. Why they can close the bank any minute, and take them all off to jail. Gosh, I'd better get my money out. Then you can put it in my bank. Oh, it will earn scads of interest. Now, you go down and get your money out of Mr. Bimble's bank right away. But I have to go to class. Which would you rather be, ignorant or bankrupt? That's a good question. C'mon. (upbeat rock music) What's the matter? Oh, it's nothing. I saw Melville again. He spoke to me. And? I couldn't think of anything to say back. Well if he spoke to you, he must be interested. Maybe next time you'll think of something to say. I sure hope so. Hey, kids, listen to me. Knock it off. Phil, go get the jukebox. I got great news for ya. After the television show, I asked Alan Freed if he'd come down to our prom. I just talked to Alan on the phone, he's comin' and he's bring a whole show. (crowd cheering) So, we're gonna rock tonight. # Gonna rock # # Gonna rock # # Gonna rock, rock, rock, rock, rock # # Gonna call for my baby about a quarter to eight # # And be there on time 'cause it never starts late # # Oh, me and my baby say we're gonna rock tonight # # Gonna rock with my doll about a quarter to nine # # 'Cause nobody else but the baby of mine # # Oh, me and my baby say we're gonna rock tonight # # Gonna rock # # Gonna rock # # Gonna rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock # # Gonna keep on rockin' 'til a quarter to 10 # # Come up for air and go rockin' again # # Oh, me and my baby say we're gonna rock tonight # # Gonna keep on rockin' 'til a quarter to 11 # # And rock along up half ways to heaven # # 'Cause me and my baby say we're gonna rock tonight # # Gonna rock # # Gonna rock # # Gonna rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock # # Gonna go on rockin' 'til a quarter to 12 # # Havin' a ball enjoying ourselves # # 'Cause me and my baby, we're gonna rock tonight # # Gonna get to the door about a quarter to one # # Kiss for awhile, what a barrel of fun # # 'Cause me and my baby say we're gonna rock tonight # # Gonna rock # # Gonna rock # # Gonna rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock # # Gonna kiss goodnight with a quarter to two # # With a heart full of love and a hole in my shoe # # 'Cause me and my baby # # We're gonna rock tonight # (crowd cheering) (birds chirping) [Gloria] Hello, Dori. Oh, hello, Gloria. I've just picked up my new evening dress. Oh. Have you gotten yours yet? Well, I haven't had time yet but I will. By the way, Gloria, do you need money? I always need money. Then I'm the one who can lend it to you. I've just gone into the banking business. What? I'm lending money. $1.00 until next allowance day to anyone who needs it. What's your rate of interest? Well, the bank charges as high as 6%, but I'm only charging one. Just 1%? If I lend you a dollar, you pay it back to me plus another dollar interest. Another dollar interest? It's a bargain when you think the banks are charging as much as 6%. Are you sure you're charging $1.00 interest on the dollar? 1% of a dollar is a dollar, isn't it? Oh, sure, sure. Tell me, Dori, have you lent much money yet? You're the first person I've asked. Mm-hmm, where'd you get the money to lend? From Arabella. She's my depositor. How much did she deposit? $15.00. Dori, instead of trying to find a lot of little $1.00 customers, how would you like to lend the whole 15 to just one person? Who? Me, with $15.00 more, I could take this tacky ole evening dress back to the dress shop. I saw a much smarter one there for $45.00. It just came in. If you lend me the 15 to buy it, I'll pay ya back plus another 15 for interest. You'll make $15.00 fast. When will you pay it back? My birthday's next week. I'm expecting a couple of checks. I'll pay ya back then. Will you give me collateral? What kind of collateral? Oh, I don't know. It has to be something worth at least $30.00. Tell you what, I'll pledge my new dress. The one I'm going to get. Alright, you write me a note saying, that if you don't pay me back, I can have the dress. Then I'll lend you the $15.00. It's a deal. Tommy, can I ask you something? - Sure. - Come here. Tommy, what do you think the school would think of a girl who took advantage of one of her own classmates? Well, I guess they wouldn't like here very much. Suppose this girl learned that one of her classmates needed money very badly, and she lent it to her? Well that's not taking advantage. That's pretty nice. But what if she lent it to her on condition that she pay it back double? Double? Who'd do a thing like that? Dori. Dori? (chuckling) I don't believe it. You can ask her. But why? She was just trying to make some money for herself. Who told you all this? I'm the one she lent the money to. That's terrible. Would be even more terrible if the whole school found out about it. Of course, I might be persuaded not to tell anyone about it. What do you mean? Well, if you took me to the prom instead of Dori, I might just possibly forget the whole thing. But I already asked Dori. You can always say you forget you'd asked me first. I can't do that. Would you rather the whole school knew about what Dori tried to do to me? Nobody would talk to her for months. (bell ringing) Dori, wait a minute. Dori, I got wonderful news. - What is it? - It's Melville. He's taking me to the prom. He asked me just five minutes ago. Oh, that's wonderful. This is my big chance. That's why I need the $15.00 I gave you. Oh, no. I've got to get a permed, a manicure, and maybe even a facial, so give me back the money. I've already loaned it out. Then get it back. A depositor has the right to get her money back when she wants it, doesn't she? Well, yes, but... [Arabella] Well this is an emergency. Arabella, I just can't. Dori Graham, if you don't give me back my money by tomorrow, I'll, I'll never speak to you again. Arabella? Gloria, come here. Gloria, I wanna talk to you. Well? It's about that money you borrowed. Your birthday was last week, and you still haven't paid it back to me. Oh, that, you really didn't think I was going to pay it back, did you? Besides, my birthday isn't until five months from now. But you told me that... And you told me you wanted $1.00 interest on every dollar you lent me. For your information, that's not 1% interest, that's 100%. It is? If you knew any arithmetic, you'd know that 1% of a dollar is .01 not $1.00. Why I could send you to jail for extortion. Well, what about the $15.00? You'll return that to me, won't you? In my own good time. Maybe a dollar a week. But I need the money now. Oh, isn't that too bad. Well, I've gotta study for my next class, and, uh, you'd better brush up on your arithmetic. (students chattering) Dori? Oh. Hello, Tommy. What's the matter? Oh, nothing. Have you been talking to Gloria? Did she tell you? Tell me what? That's she going to the prom with me. What? I asked her weeks ago, and I'd thought she'd forgotten about it. Gloria and you? Oh, Tommy. (crying) (bird chirping) Poor little bird. I know just how you feel. (atmospheric orchestral music) # Little blue wren # # I know why # # Little blue wren # # Why you cry # # Nobody knows # # Nobody cares # # That your love has flown away # # Little blue wren # # In the sky # # Little blue wren # # Way up high # # Love didn't stay # # It flew away # # Now your heart's # # No longer gay # # With your head # # Upon your shoulder # # You just cry # # And hope that he # # Will return # # Before you're older # # And I know 'cause it happened to me # # So little blue wren # # In a tree # # Little blue wren # # Wait and see # # Some day he'll know # # You love him so # # And then he'll # # Come back again # # And you'll # # No more be # # A little # # Blue # # Wren # (Dori sighing) (Dori sighing) Well, what's the matter now? Oh, nothing. Father, if a person lends another person money, and the other person refuses to pay, can that person do anything to the other person? Well, that depends. Did the other person give the person any collateral for the loan? Yeah, she did. Well, then the person can foreclose. Foreclose? Uh-huh, assume ownership of the collateral in lieu of the unpaid loan. Assume ownership, really? It's the law. Hey, where are you going, it's almost dinner time? Tell Mother not to wait, I'll be back later. But it's very simple, Miss Silky. I just wanna foreclose on a collateral dress. But I don't understand? Is this some kind of joke? It's absolutely serious. Would you mind waiting just a minute? Miss Silky, is my dress almost ready? [Miss Silky] Just a minute. Here it is. Oh. It's so beautiful. (door bell ringing) I can't wait to see what it looks like on me. Dori? Thank you for calling me, Miss Silky. Father, what are you doing here? This is a ladies shop. Miss Silky called me, and told me she'd keep you here until I could get here. (door bell ringing) Now what's this all about? Yeah, that's what I wanna know. I tried to tell you on the phone, Mr. Barker. Dori says your daughter borrowed some money from her and refused to pay it back, and now she's claiming this dress. I'm just foreclosing on the collateral. You mean, Gloria gave you this dress as collateral for a loan? Why did you have to borrow money? Well, I didn't really like the $30.00 dress you bought me, and I happened to see this beautiful dress for $45.00, and I knew you wouldn't give me anymore money, so... So you borrowed it from my daughter, but where did Dori get it to lend? She borrowed it form Arabella. No, I didn't. Arabella was my depositor. But I don't have to pay the money back because Dori charged me 100% interest when she gave me the money, and that's against the law. 100% interest? Dori. I made a mistake, Father. I thought I was charging 1%. Never was very good at arithmetic but she knew it, and she didn't tell me. Besides, you said the dress belonged to me as collateral. Well, yes, it does legally. Now wait just a minute. I paid $30.00 for that dress. And I paid another $15.00. I'm not going to let you take a $45.00 dress for a $15.00 loan. Well, there's only one other thing to do. Pay Dori the money that Gloria borrowed from her, and forget the whole the thing. I'm not going to pay Gloria's debt. Well, I admit, you got me stumped. Do you have any other suggestions? - No. - Do you? No. I have a suggestion. Mr. Barker just wants his $30.00. Right. Father, here's a chance for you to make a real bargain. All you have to do is give Mr. Barker his $30.00, and you get a $45.00 dollar dress for only $30.00. Yeah, sounds good. Now, wait a minute, young lady. Our agreement was that I pay $15.00, and you earn the other 15. Yes, but I'm saving you $15.00 at the price of the dress. Now that's the same as if I earned $15.00, isn't it? Now, just do as I say. First, give Gloria's father his money back. Now, the dress is mine. But you still have to give Arabella her $15.00. How do you think you'll get around that? Oh, that's simple. Here, Miss Silky, I'd like to turn this $45.00 dress in for the $30.00 dress and a $15.00 refund. Now you can get the dress for me. It's only $15.00 more. After all the trouble you've caused? Trying to take advantage of Dori? Sneaking behind my back to buy a dress that costs more? Nothing doing, Gloria. I don't buy any dress for you. Not even a $30.00 one? Sorry, this is the last one left. A blue strapless dress. Tommy's favorite color. She's taking my dress. Come on, we're going home. Oh. Now let me see. Dori saved me $15.00, so that's the same as earning $15.00. Then she took the dress, she exchanged the $45.00 dress for the $30.00 dress... Here's your refund, Dori. Come in in the morning, and we'll fit the dress. Thank you, Miss Silky. We'd better go home, Father. Dinner's probably still waiting. Father, are you alright? Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Oh, goodnight, Miss Silky. (crickets chirping) (drum roll) Everybody quiet.

Dori, I've gotta talk to you. I told you on the phone, I have nothing more to say to you. Gloria made me take her to the prom. How could she make you take her?

I didn't believe you'd do anything bad, but I believed she'd tell everybody. And now, here is your own singing star, Tommy Rogers. Go on.
