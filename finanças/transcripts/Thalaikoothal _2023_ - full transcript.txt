You just don't care about our family! - You're always lost in your own world! - Shut up! Oh! Did I hurt your ego now? I'm not sure if this is our house or a hospital! I just got back from work. Leave me alone! You sleep all day and leave for work at night. Do you even care about me and our child? Yes, I do. Quiet now. Dad, have you seen my Tamil notebook? It must be lying around somewhere. Look properly. I can't find it. You're always out playing… and remember everything at the last minute! Search for it properly, you idiot! I left it right here, Mom. Dear, look for it in Grandpa's room. Okay. I'll look for it there, Dad. Dad, Grandpa wet his bed. - Dad, grandpa just wet the bed. - I'm coming. Kalai, please get some hot water. Dad… Dad. There's nothing to worry about. It's okay. Hey, go away! I said, go away! Bye, Grandpa. Didn't you hear me? I asked you to leave! Dad… you know, Chargesheet Aarmugam and his wife had twins. The skinny guy who was always fond of you. You should see how he looks now. Dad… Dad! He closed his eyes a long time ago. It's time you opened your eyes! Your eyes are already open, yet it doesn't see a thing. Dad, it's okay. We're almost done. Don't mind her, Dad. Dad. Do you hear me, Dad? Dad? Come here. Come, eat. Eat. Have it. GOVERNMENT SCHOOL Hey, hold my plate. Ma'am, he stole my egg! Suresh, give back my egg! Ma'am! Come here, Raji. I'll give you another one. Wow! She gave me two eggs instead! Jujube! Jujube! Have some fresh jujube! Jujube! Jujube! Have some fresh jujube! Jujube! Jujube! Have some fresh jujube! Grandpa, I've brought you eggs today. Here. Remember that guy who makes fun of me? Zero Suresh? He snatched away the egg from my plate today. I complained about it and got two eggs instead. Everything looks normal. See you, Dad. A bird in solitude During the dawn of the day… Bye, Dad! Giving birth to a mesmerizing evening My heart plays like the Veena Giving birth to a mesmerizing evening What is Accent Marks? Specific marks used with letters for different pronunciations… are known as Accent Marks. There are ten types of Accent Marks. Hey… weren't you studying the same thing yesterday? I warned you to not play wearing your uniform! Here. Freshen up yourself and then have this. You are light in the shadow My passion flows like a wave inside it In dreams and reality… Sir, I'll take out a loan in the next couple of days and return your money. My foot! You're saying that now?! Once my dad regains consciousness, I'll get back to a proper job. I'll settle your debt then. When will that happen? After three months? Four months? You've been telling me the same thing for the past six months. Look, your father is almost a lost cause. - Nothing can happen. - Sir… I don't want to hear the same excuse again. I am an unpredictable man. I won't be the Mr. Nice guy next time. Mind you! I promise. I'll settle the debt. Calling out to the lover… Vembu. What is it? - Come, let's go. - Where to? Will you come only if I tell you? Just get here! - Dhanam! - Yes? Bring me my crutch. Hold on. Here you go. - Here, take my blessings. - What? Get your husband's blessing. Very funny! Never mind, see you! - Meet the advocate on your way back. - Okay. Come on. Are you seriously taking me along for this crap? - Come on man! - Relax. We have so many scapegoats in our village. - This one is for sacrifice. - I wasn't talking about actual goats. Vemba! - I am talking about you. - Just come. Ma'am… Welcome, dear. Did you just remember me? See how Lord Gurusamy brought you here! Please don't be angry. Your father is ill and bedridden… and you're here to find out when he will regain consciousness. Am I right? The entire village knows that. Stop playing God! Hey, why did you bring this useless guy along? Quiet! - I'll try my best. - Yes, please. Descend on to me, Lord! Lord Kottur Gurusamy, come possess me. It's been long since I last saw you. Where did I fail you, dear Lord? Please descend upon me! Lord, my dear Pazhani is here. His father is ill and bedridden. Please tell us. When will his father regain consciousness? Yeah. Okay. I'll pass on the message. I'll tell him. - Dear… - Yes? Guess what Lord Kottur Gurusamy told me? To buy some booze? Hey! What did he tell you? He said, by the Tamil month, Aavani, your father will open his eyes. Thank you. What will you do in return for Lord Gurusamy? Whatever is the Lord's wish. - A goat sacrifice. - Really? Let's do it then. If my father opens his eyes, I shall arrange a feast for the entire village. Pick out one of the best goats for him. Does Lord Gurusamy only demand meat? Doesn't he prefer flowers or fruits? You rammed your rickshaw into a tree and lost a leg because of your foul mouth. My bad, I should've rammed onto you and saved the village. Hey! - Shut up and come on! - Please don't mind him. Get the sacrificial goat. I can't take care of the goat with everything that's going on. I have a lot to do currently. Come on, don't embarrass me. That's the least I could do for you. - Okay. - Listen… - you can pay for the goat later. - Okay. - For now, just pay for its food. - Okay. Take the money from him. Here. - I shall take your leave. - Okay. Get it here. Go, tie it up. Hey! What's with that long face of yours? - Hey… - Yes? Instead of wasting your money here, can't you pay the interest on your loan? Do you think she is better than a doctor? She is a crook. Why are you letting yourself fall into her trap? Hey, Vemba… until now, only my daughter and I prayed for my father's good health. Now the entire village will pray for him. Muniyandi will announce the feast to the entire village. At least for the sake of relishing meat, the village will pray for my father. Hey… when everyone wishes for the same thing, it'll definitely happen. I strongly believe in that. Do as you wish then! All set? - Yes. - Okay. This is where I first worked as a head mason. You should have seen how happy he was for me. He was on cloud nine. It was right here… where he slipped and fell. He could have just woken me up! I fell asleep that day. He didn't want to disturb me. So he came up and started watering the walls. I was 16 when I started learning this work from my father. I would indulge in mischief to provoke him… but he never raised his hands on me. On my first day of work… he gave me this. He told me… "Learn to do this and everything will fall in place" Hey… I don't really believe in rebirths. But if that's a real thing… I want to be reborn as your father. No way! He's gonna be my father in every life. Dad, let go of me. - I wanna go out and play. - Massage my back first. No, Dad. I want to go out and play. I see. I've something for you in the cupboard. - Really? - Yes. Dad, is it the ten rupees one? Massage harder. I'll tell you. Dad, is it the ten rupees one or twenty rupees one? Twenty. Hey, come back here! - Who is it? - Your father, Mom. He's got nothing to talk to me about. He must be calling to talk to you. Yes, Grandpa? Mom? She is washing clothes. Pechi… I wish I was the cloth you wash. I can remove the dirt from clothes… but not from your mind. Hey… Pechi… There is no dirt in my mind. It is dirt. No! It's love. Sit here. Welcome, Pazhani. Have a seat. So, when you throw a feast, do not forget to invite this uncle. And, you, don't forget to carry your false teeth. One tea for him. No duty today? There's his duty call. - Hey! - Yes? I know a chef who cooks meat well. Natchiyarpuram Subbiah. You must taste his meat gravy! The meat will be so soft and tender. Take a bite and… it melts in your mouth! - Okay… - Watch out, you might choke on the meat. Don't talk rubbish when I'm talking well! - I'll beat you up! - This isn't your age of having chicken… See you. Hey, Pechi! I'm cursed too. Breathe into me. All young and old men in this village… are affected by the same curse. My breath will only fall upon… the one whom I choose to marry. Well… why can't that be me? This week we will see our very own wonder of the world The Taj Mahal. I want to do this as soon as we get the accident money. I want a baby. FERTILITY TREATMENT ADVERTISEMENT Do we really need to do it artificially? Let it happen naturally. In Agra, Uttar Pradesh… Fine, forget it. You don't even want to consult a doctor. Hey! Did our mothers ever consult doctors? You have a reason for everything! Here. Watch TV and have fun. Go ahead. The Taj Mahal incorporates on design traditions of earlier Mughal architecture. At least pasting these baby posters gives me false hope. Kavya. Good. B. Suresh. How do you all think he scored? Zero! One mark. Here. Ask your father to come tomorrow. I am no more "Zero Suresh" hereafter! Okay? Hey! Shut up and sit down! Showing off as if he scored full marks! P. Rajeswari. P. Rajeswari! What happened? Your marks are gradually decreasing. Aren't you studying properly? Here. Get your parent's signature. Pradeep. Very good. He is the topper. Give him a round of applause. Dad… Yes? Shall I make you some coffee? Something's fishy. Why are you buttering me up? You cheeky nut! Did you mess up? Sign it. - Did you score low marks? - Mom will thrash me. Give it to me. I'll take care of it. So, shall I make you some coffee? - No. Just go out and play. - No, I'll make it. Wow! Madam! Coming. Here. Count the clothes. - Your daughter slept? - Just now. I heard that there'd be a feast if your father-in-law opens his eyes. - Who said so? - The whole village knows. Don't you? - Fine. - Yeah. What the hell is wrong with you? Why didn't you tell me about the feast? Listen, I forgot. I know! You've forgotten me too. My life is ruined here. You can't even afford to buy me talcum powder! But you want to throw a feast for the whole village? Who do you think you are? Royal blood? How dare you announce such a thing? Are you there on the call? I am talking to you! Can you hear me? I know that you can hear me very well. Answer… Madam! Madam, it's me. Pechi. Lower it. Pechi. Pechi! Here. Paratha from Naicker's shop. Stop eating the villagers' leftovers. Here. It's the fate of people like me… to eat the villager's leftovers. No, thanks. Pechi, stop. Please take it. Do you think honor doesn't matter… to someone who eats leftovers? Look. I am not that kind of a man. I'll take good care of you until my last breath. Then why give me this food secretly? Do you have the guts to do this when everyone's there? And he claims he'll take care of me until his last breath! Do I have any respect in this house? Move. How dare you disconnect my call?! Let's talk this out inside. Do you think I'm gonna stay quiet? How dare you go and announce the feast without permission?! I am talking to you! Tell me, whom did you ask? Why should I ask for permission?! What do you mean by that? Didn't I borrow money from my dad for your dad's treatment? Am I not taking care of the family? I am working, toiling hard and supporting the family… and here you are telling me, "Why should I ask for permission?" Everything's okay. Your salary isn't even enough for his medicines and your vehicle gas. You've already borrowed money from all over... - Mom. - You're good. - What is it? - Can you comb my hair? Come! We've lost all our gold! You've pawned it off! This fake gold hurts my neck! He can't get my gold back… but his highness will throw a feast for the entire village! Your pulse is fine. There is nothing left in this house! Hey! I'm cursing you today! I hope your father never opens his eyes! Hey, shut up! Stand properly! Hold this! To hell with your curse! The entire village is praying for my father! How did I end up marrying her?! Yeah, right, the villagers! Did the villagers or your own relatives ever offer to help you? While you're away working all night, I am the one who takes care of things here. You know something? Sometimes, when you're at work… it feels like I'm living with a dead body. Am I not living with a devil too? What did you say? Come again! Had your food? I am hungry. I'll go eat. You shouldn't have food prepared by the devil. You and your father can starve! Come here! Your hair's gotten dry. I've asked you to oil it so many times. He's spoiling her too. Hid her marksheet from me! What the hell was wrong with you? Brother… Yes? What are you doing? Welcome. Father-in-law is here too! Welcome. A chameleon has entered the house. It's a sign of bad luck. - Come, let's eat. - Yes, coming. Go away! Please, sit down. You know how she is, right? Come, sit down and eat. She called us up and pestered us, saying you'd be starving. Serve him some sides. Here. Have this. I need to talk to him. Come, dear. I'm hesitant yet I have to say this. I must say it. Neither can he eat by himself nor wash himself. Listen, if I'm in such a situation ever… perform Thalaikoothal and send me off peacefully. Quiet now. Don't talk nonsense. I am serious. If he could talk, he'd prefer Thalaikoothal too. Even if he says that, as a son, I will not do it. You won't do it. Why will you do it? After all, it's my daughter, whose life is getting ruined. I am the one suffering every day for marrying my daughter off to you! I gave you my daughter's hand because I admired your workmanship. But now you're doing a good-for-nothing security job like worn-out oldies. Is that what you want to do in your prime? It hurts to see my daughter go to work at the match factory. Dear… he got bedridden during last the Tamil month of Karthigai. How long will you clean his excrement? He is suffering and also making you all suffer. Imagine the plight of your family if this continues. I will give you a suggestion. Please think about it. Forget morals. Let's do Thalaikoothal. Let's do it and get on with life. There is a reason why his life is still ticking! He will definitely get back on his feet. Thalaikoothal? Never! So, this is why you got me biryani for lunch? This won't work out! Bring your sister and Raji to our home. Dad! Wait. What? Hands off me! Wait. I'll talk. Brother, a word. - What? - Listen. Didn't Muniyandi say your father will recover by the month of Aavani? Don't you believe that? Just tell him that. Just tell him. Dad, let's wait till the month of Aavani! - If not, then we'll do as you wish. - Can't he say that? No matter what, I will never do this. I see! Then my daughter won't live with you. I know what to do! Then don't come running to my house saying you miss your wife and kid! Dad, wait. Dad! Dad, wait! Dad… everything's fine. I'll remove it, wait. I asked my brother to buy you food. I didn't expect dad will also join him. Pazhani, where are you? Dear. Pazhani. Hey Pazhani. Come here. Promise that you won't hit me. When have I ever hit you? Come here. Careful. Why are you catching chameleons, instead of going to school? How many chameleons have you killed so far? - Two and a half. - And a half? I killed two lizards last week. You saved this one. - Pazhani… - Yes? We must not take lives. That's a sin. Okay? Every life that comes into this world must go on its own. We must not take any lives. Why? Every time someone takes a life, it creates a hole in the earth. If we keep taking lives, the earth will eventually become a big hole and disappear. - Understand? - Yes. Listen carefully, this pot represents famine, this one represents rain… and this represents the yields. Now, as you walk around it… you must sing, "Rain, famine, yields…" - Okay? - Okay. - Rain, famine, yields… - Rain, famine, yields… Guys, do the ritual cry! - Rain, famine, yields… - Rain, famine, yields… Pick the famine pot… and hold that stick. You, come here. Hand the pot over to her and act like you're hitting her with the stick. - No, I can't. - Why, dear? - I can't… - Just act like hitting her. No, I won't. Never mind, hand the stick over to her. Give the pot to her. - You, act like you're hitting her. - Okay. Okay. Now, head towards the north, go to the junction and break it. Rain, rain, rain… You asked me if I had the guts, right? - Leave me. - Let the villagers see us. There, your breath fell upon me. What do you say now? Say? Where's Pechi? She's not back yet. We have successfully completed the rituals. Hands off me! You stink of feces. I'll be right back. Do you think a bath will wash away this stench? Brother… imagine how good things would be if humans had wings instead of hands. In that case, there wouldn't have been any borders. The whole world would have been one place. Then I'd happily spread my wings, fly all over and enjoy nature. - Vemba. - Yeah? My wife doesn't value me at all. Nobody in this world can hurt us as they do. I can handle anybody… but her. Oh my God! I'm not like other men. I'm just taking care of my father. Is that a sin? I should probably get drunk and beat her up like other men. - But, they give us pleasure too. - Get lost! Her father and brother are hell-bent on performing Thalaikoothal on my dad. How inhumane! Look, he is your father, so you can keep patience. But, you can't expect the same from them. Patience is what makes a human a human. Else he's just a beast. In this world, only useful things have value. This bottle has no value once the liquor is over. Your father is just like this empty bottle. Who's gonna respect you if you value this empty bottle? My father might be an empty bottle for them. But, he is the one who gave me this life. My father matters the most to me. The rest of them comes next. Give me that. It's a sin to want someone dead. I realize that. But it's been so long, Dhanam. Don't worry, everything will be fine. I hope it does or I'll definitely go crazy. I can't take it anymore. - Listen. - Yes? How can someone die if they're fed tender coconut? They're not just fed the coconut. They're massaged with oil on the head. Along with a cold bath. Then, they let the person lie on the floor with wet clothes for days. The person will eventually die out of pneumonia. Isn't that the same as committing murder? It's performed on an elderly, who is on the edge of life. But, still… I asked you about fertility treatment, and you said that birth should happen naturally. Isn't it the same for death too? Why not let that happen naturally? Why the double standards? I was bedridden for a month and you were frustrated, right? If you were in her shoes, you'd have finished off that old man by now. Shall we play "Hop and catch" later? Raji. What is it? Shall we become "phriends"? It's not "phriends" it's "friends". Say it again. Damn this English. It's so hard. Fine, shall we become friends? Here take this. I hope it's real candy and you're not tricking me. No! I'm not tricking you. Okay. We're friends now. Won't you share some with me? The teacher is coming. You've been called at the warehouse. Will you marry me? Your breath fell upon me, right? Just leave! Why? Don't you like me? I'll go complain about you to the village council. Tell them about this too. Dad… I checked your pulse. Everything's good. - Dear! - Yes, Dad? - Pinch me. - Why, Dad? Just do it. Pinch harder. - Did that hurt? - It did. So, this is real and not a dream. Come on, put your foot in here. It's okay. Slowly. Be patient. These fishes will cure your wound. There, he started with his mischief! Suresh, come here. Grandpa, remember "Zero Suresh" who always fools around? This is him. He is here to meet you. What is this? We feed Grandpa through this pipe. - I'll show you how. - And what is this for? He breathes through it. Can he hear what you speak? What if he can? Here, feed him this too. He knows no taste. The food goes directly into his stomach. Dad… all ready? Dad… You got bedridden… and the construction of this house came to a halt. You must get back up on your feet… and we will finish this work full-fledged together. The hero's sight fell upon her Hereafter… I'll eat only your leftovers. Dad, wake up! Grandpa opened his eyes. Get up. Look, he opened his eyes. Dad! Dad, it's me, Pazhani. - Here's Raji. - Grandpa… I'll be right back. - Come with me! - What is it? Dhanam, you come too. - What happened? - Just come. Come on! Quick! Dhanam, come on. Dad, look who is here. - Dad. - Sir? Dad, it's Vembu. It's me. Vembu. Grandpa… Dad, do you recognize me? It's me, Pazhani. GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL, KOVILPATTI Muthu. Muthu, listen to me. Blink your eyes once. Good. Now blink your eyes twice. Very good. Do you recognize him, Muthu? Do you recognize him? If yes, then blink your eyes once. If no, then blink your eyes twice. Do you recognize him? Very good. Pazhani, your father is completely aware of everything. Come… let's see if he recognizes you. Muthu, do you recognize him? If yes then blink once. Dad… do you recognize me? He recognizes you. Great! Dad. That's good. Pazhani, come with me. Come, sit here. Doctor, will my father recover soon? It'll be tough, I won't deny that. At least he opened his eyes. He still has a long way to go to recover. Let's see. Everybody in the village said my father wouldn't survive. But now, he has opened his eyes. I am sure he'll get up and walk soon. Let's hope for the best. - Okay? - Okay. Hey! Pass me my sari. I want your fragrance to be all over me. Come on, give me my sari. Give it! Here, drape this red sari. My mother had bought it for the girl who would be my bride. Grandpa, did you hear everything that I spoke to you all these days? Tell me. Did you hear me? Dad, you were right. All these days Grandpa heard everything that we said. Hey, go wash your plate. - Okay, Dad. - Go. Hey… don't be upset. My father opened his eyes. Now, everything will be fine. Eat. Here, eat properly. Eat. Madam, it's me, Pechi. It's fresh, not leftovers. Taste it and tell me if it's sweet. Father-in-law… Father-in-law… are you asleep? I might have said some things in the heat of the moment. Please don't take it to your heart. Will you forgive me? Okay, get some rest. Hey! Do you still smell feces on me? Tell me. Look at his audacity! You haven't paid the interest for what you already owe. And you want more money now? Well, I took a vow to arrange a feast. My father opened his eyes, sir. - Who will help me, if not you? - Boss… Come. Did Pandi, the dried fish shop owner return the money? It stinks. Keep it there. You roughed him up yesterday, so he settled all the debt today. Pazhani… I do feel bad looking at you standing and pleading like this. After all, we are related. Today is a new moon day. You can have the money. - Take it. - You sure? Give it to him. Just hand over your house document. For what? Come on, I am not going to eat it. Instead of it lying in your house, let it lie in mine. - The document in exchange for money? - No worries. Complete your vow well, Pazhani. Don't forget to hand over your house document. Sir… You are light in the shadow My passion flows like a wave inside it We give you clothes to wash… and you enjoy wearing them too? Shall I complain to the village council? From now on, all your clothes will have my fragrance. Dear… Dad… you look great! Just like a king! What?! Do you think so too? Pazhani. Yes? Coming. - Where are you? - Keep it right there! Eat well. - Pazhani, the meat seems to be hard. - Yes? As if you could devour it if the meat was soft. Ask your sister, how I devour! Stop messing with him and eat! Please eat. Mince the meat for him. - Excuse me. Serve some meat, please. - I just gave you some. Come on, - show some respect to your elders. - Yes, sure. - Yes, I'm telling them. - Pazhani, ask them to serve me meat. Sure, I'll tell. Please eat. Grandpa, Suresh is here. Remember him? He's the guy who tried to scare you that day. This is him. Look, he recognized you! Talk to him. Hi, Grandpa. How are you? - Everyone will get some. - Get in a line. - Wait. - Patience. Get in the line! I'll need another glass. This won't be enough Grandpa, this ice cream is awesome. Really? Why don't you come along to my village? There are a lot of ice cream shops there. - What about school? - You can go from there. - Fine, I'll come then. - Okay. - No, I'm not coming. - Why? If I come there, who will feed my grandpa? What happened, Grandpa? Then won't you feed this grandpa? If you get bedridden like him, then I'd surely feed you. Why are you gossiping instead of having the feast? Your words came true. When have my predictions ever gone wrong? Go around the village - and tell everyone about it. - I'll surely tell them. Serve the meat with bones for the youths and boneless for the oldies. - Dear… - Welcome. So, do you trust me now? I've always trusted you. Please eat. I'm fasting today. Then what is this for? For the deity. You mean for the one draped in a green sari? Mind your own business. Dhanam, see how rude your husband is. Don't trust him. Come to me and you'll start vomiting within a month. Do you stink that bad? Don't you bathe? Stop your mockery and try to get your wife pregnant. Sir! Sir… Are you well? So happy that you've opened your eyes. I spoke to the Gurusamy and gave a solution. Now the whole village is happy. I'm only allowed to… wash the clothes that you people wear. Not to wear one. Only the women of your caste… has the right to wear them. Pech… My mother used to tell a story about us. There was a time when humans never washed clothes… and the earth started to stink. Lord Shiva summoned our clan deity, Veerbhadran. He ordered him, "Go with your men and wash people's clothes on earth." "If you fail, your clan will perish.” Now tell me. Won't it be a sin if I stop washing clothes? I shall be your mistress. Let's not get married. Someone has cooked up stories in the name of God… and you believe it? Be my wife if you want to be with me. I cannot make you my mistress fearing these villagers. Our first kiss… will be after I tie the knot with you. I am scared. Here. This is not for some girl from my caste. It is for you. Even my clan deity married a girl from a different caste. No God is against love. It's only humans. - Is that Marimuthu? - Yes. - Who is she? - Look at them! Look at them! How dare they?! - It's been going on for a long time. - In broad daylight? He's given her a sari! Times have gone bad. What can we say? Come. Do you recognize him? Do you recognize me? Do you recognize me? Marimuthu, until your son is here, nothing will happen to you. You will get up and run around in a couple of days, I say! Okay. Looks like quite a celebration. From where did you arrange the money? I know. You'd have borrowed it. Dad, his father opened his eyes. Everything will be fine once he goes back to work. Don't worry. Brother… come to the city with me. With your talent… I'll make sure our family flourishes. We can even put your daughter in a good school. Talking of which, where is she? Raji! - Darling, come here. - Yes, Grandpa. Okay, I'm leaving. - Uncle, what about you? - What about me? - Come on, give. - Give what? Just give. Here. Okay, see you. - We're leaving. - Okay. Pechi… God appeared in my dream yesterday. My God or yours? Both of them. And? They said there is a solution to lift the curse. What did the Gods tell you? Come. Sit. "Hey Marimuthu, marry Pechi… and have a house full of children. Then the clan will survive! It won't come to an end! Your legacy will carry on!" That's what the Gods told me. Pechi… Pechi. What happened? If we get married, the villagers won't let us live. That's only if we stay here. We'll move to the town. There is no caste over there. Only hard work holds value. Okay? Dad, I don't want to go to school. You can survive only if you get educated. Aren't you doing well for yourself? I'll come with you and build houses. I'm toiling hard in the scorching heat. If you study well and become an engineer, you can build skyscrapers. Did the so-called engineers build the temples and monumental towers here? So you have decided against going to school? Fine, complete your 10th grade. Then we shall take a call. Okay, Dad. I will also build skyscrapers. Dad, you will get up and walk soon, right? Dad, I believed you will open your eyes and you did. Likewise, you will get up and walk too. Don't worry. Okay? Can I ask you something? Have you ever thought about dying? Not even once? Pazhani was right then! You will definitely get back on your feet! Who knows… What lies on The other side of the rainbow? The times we held our hands together Are moments of pure joy The gloomy night and the sunny day Coexist in harmony The dreams of humankind Fades away into thin air Millions of wishes in the heart There is no restriction to celebrate them Who knows… What lies on The other side of the rainbow? Every being longs to live Till the last moment The Grey hair paints love Even during old age Every being longs to live Till the last moment The Grey hair paints love Even during old age What the fate holds? Who can predict it? We embraced the shadows But lost the reality Words and tunes came together To create a beautiful song Positives and negatives come together To make everyone's future Who knows… What lies on The other side of the rainbow? Here. Your accident claim has been approved. Happy? When will we get the money, madam? - It'll be credited within a week. - Is it? Fine. Everything will be fine. Okay, madam. We shall leave now. Careful. Ma'am, the supervisor has asked you to finish this work and leave. What is a soul? What is a body? You are now the daughter-in-law of my house. What happened? You could've found better girls in your caste. Why me? Not just in my caste… but I have never seen a girl with such beautiful eyes anywhere. I just want to drown and lose myself in your eyes. Then where will I find you? I'll be the laughter when you laugh. I'll be the tears when you cry. I'll be the air that you breathe out. What is life? It's a mirage of deception What is sin? It's a display of greed Am I dreaming? Do you want to know if this is for real? Kiss me and you'll know. Pechi! Dad! Let go of me! Dad, no! Don't! Dad, let her go! Dad! Pechi! Muthu! Muthu? Dad… - Come, let's talk. - Doctor… He has lost it again. There is no response. He's not even feeling pain. Is there any other way? No, I am afraid so. I can only pacify you by saying… only God knows. What happened? He stops the vehicles on road, right? The new sub-inspector warned him against it. So he tried to stop a train. Luckily, the villagers pulled him back. Come on, what's all this? Here, buy him something to eat. - It's okay. I will take care of him. - Just have it. Pechi! Pechi! Tender coconut! Tender coconut! Tender coconut! Tender coconut! Tender coconut! Boss… Pazhani, only you come here. Did you want to see me? I heard your father has closed his eyes again. You keep giving excuses and don't pay the interest. It's not like that. And now I can never expect it. I've got a buyer and have fixed a deal on your house. Sir? The registration is in two days. Come and sign the documents. Please, sir. What do you mean? I don't understand. Sell the house, pay my debt and you'd still be left with some money. You can treat your father in a good hospital. I am raising my daughter in that house. You should have thought about it before borrowing. - Sir… - I've decided and fixed the deal. - Sign the documents after two days. - Please, don't say so. - I shall fall at your feet. - I've fixed the deal. - Sir… - Hey, put down your hands! - Sir… - I said, put your hands down! Why are you pleading with this fellow? Vemba, this is between Pazhani and me! He pledged his house and borrowed the money! If he doesn't pay interest, I will sell it! - So don't talk like a fool! - Hey! - Come, we'll go to the police. - Hey! - Let's go complain about him. - Yeah, do that! - Go to the police! - I'll break your jaws. Please, stop. Please, show some mercy. Pazhani, I'll give you a month's time. - Clear all the debt you owe me. - Okay. - Leave. - Get lost! Why are you falling at his feet? Brother… please light the cigarette for me. This is new. Light it yourself. - Please light it up for me. - What's wrong with you? - What happened? - Nothing. How can Vembu do this? I pity this girl's future How is she going to survive alone? "I was born and brought up in this small village. But I don't wish to die here. I am going to travel all around the world. Like the Pelican that visits our village pond… I want to keep flying all over the world. The moment I cannot fly, I must drop dead then and there. The memories that we cherish during our death, that is what life is all about! I got the insurance money, Dhanam. I am taking it with me. I have written off the house and fields in your name. The advocate will update you on the rest. I cannot father you a child. Forgive me. I want you to get married to someone else, have a lot of kids and live happily. My dear brother Pazhani… forgive me for leaving without bidding goodbye. Your friendship is the best thing to ever happen to me. For the good person you are, your father will definitely recover one day. Don't search for me. I am leaving." - This is the kitchen. - Okay. This is where we all will sit and watch TV. I'll park my two-wheeler right here. - Then... - What about Grandpa? Now that Pechi is gone, you have to wash all our clothes. Here. Marimuthu, here. You have to wash these saris from now on. She forgot that she is Janakan's daughter Lord Rama arrived at the Yamuna river Pandi won't be coming today. His son is unwell. Can you cover this shift? Please understand, I have to go home - to take care of my father... - He isn't done yet. Just for today. Please take care of it, Pazhani. Please… Lord Rama arrived at the Yamuna river And Janaki was waiting for him there GOVERNMENT SCHOOL I didn't tell you… but I've been transporting loads to the warehouse. Weren't you sitting and working inside? I've been replaced by another lady. She just complies with the supervisor's needs. That perverted jerk! I don't want to work in that match factory anymore. Should I find you another job? I can't go to work anymore. Can I suggest something? Promise me you won't get angry. My brother is calling repeatedly. He says he'll settle all our debt. Just say the word and… Did you meet your father today? Do you want us to live well at the expense of taking a life? Don't you think it's a sin? - Okay. - Measure from the north side. You come here. Come on. What's going on here? Your husband had pledged the house document and borrowed money. It doesn't seem like he will settle it. So, I brought a buyer to sell the house. Any problem? Is this how you'll barge in when the man of the house is out? Come again! With whose money did you throw a feast? This RRP's money! - And you get angry when I ask for it? - Leave now! - Leave! - Some issue with the property? - Wait, can't you see I'm talking? - You too, leave! Ask your husband to come and see me. Come on, guys. Tailing the ass of all the debtors has become a routine for me now! Where is the house document? It must be there. Come and show it to me. It must be there. Check it for yourself. This one? This one, right? I am a fool and you are a smart ass! You think you can cheat me with fake papers. Aren't you ashamed? To think I slept with this man and had a child! When it comes to your dad, it's all murder, sin and immoral! What do you call this? Can you please keep quiet? I won't say a word, God! RRP sold our house. They came in and measured it too! Henceforth, we should live in the streets. Hey! What? They measured it?! I only pledged it. He can't sell it. - I'll settle the debt in a month. - My foot! You can't settle the existing debt… and this you'll settle in a month's time? Your daughter and I are all that you are left with. Push us into some well and lead a good life with your father. Don't talk unnecessarily. I know what has to be done. I'm yelling out furiously here… and you don't even give a damn about our house. Instead, you want to build this toy house! Hey! Hey! What are you doing?! How dare you raise your hand on me? Oh my God! You bitch! You bloody cunt! Stop! Stop! - He's coming to kill me! - Stop! - Hey! - Sister… - Listen to me. Stop. - Let me go! Come! - Come and kill me. - Let go of me! - Let him kill me. - Just let it go. Calm down. Dad, don't let go of my hands. Dad, hold on to my hand. Grab my hands! Dad! Dad! Pazhani, won't you ask us inside? Please come in. Hey. - Spread a carpet. - No need. Why the formality? Don't treat us as guests. Sit down, everybody. Pazhani, here's your house document. Your brother-in-law retrieved the house document and settled all your debt. After all, he earns in the city. Isn't it? Tell me, sir. Pazhani, you took good care of your father. No one in this village can question you on that. But you can't drag your family to live in the streets. Can you? Answer me. You go to the city with your brother-in-law. It's our fate to work with the shovel in this village. You are a skilled laborer who knows the trade. Go to the city and try to make a good living. Fine, I'll go. Can you take my father to your house and look after him? Answer me. Will you take care of him? Dear, this is wrong. Didn't Gurusamy tell you that your father will open his eyes? Didn't we all enjoy the feast and celebrate? Right? Seeing your father's plight, I asked Gurusamy again. I confronted God himself. He said, he is suffering and so please send him off. Now we must obey God, shouldn't we? You don't have to move a finger. We shall take care of everything. Let's perform Thalaikoothal on him. Isn't this common in our village? This is not something new. - Why are you all quiet? Tell him. - Yes, we too agree. Yes, he's right. What are you talking about? Didn't you bring me here to resolve the spat between husband and wife? And now you are talking about Thalaikoothal? Pazhani, perform Thalaikoothal on these four! Every village has such heartless and jobless people. Useless fellows! Pazhani, forget him. We are concerned about your welfare. Perform Thalaikoothal on him. Pazhani, they have a point. Give it a good thought. All of you are here, forcing me to take a life. Don't you have any mercy? Did you show mercy while chasing my daughter and trying to kill her? Dad! To hell with his morals! Please be quiet. Brother… didn't we all celebrate when he opened his eyes? He lost it again. Even the doctor has given up hope. You are being unfair with your stand. We aren't asking to perform it on a healthy person. He has lived his life. On what basis did you say that? Life means the same to a newborn or an elderly. Yeah, you talk as if he's in his prime! He is old enough to die. Look here… Age is defined by the life that is left in us, not the one we're done living. Old enough to die? Let go of your useless philosophies and be practical. Your family might indulge in such cheap acts but not me. - How dare you? Mind your words! - Dad, sit down! Wait. - Step back. - Cheap act? You're going beyond limits! Before your father, his parents had a girl child. Your grandmother killed that newborn baby! Now you know whose family indulges in cheap acts! I don't care what others did! I will not do it. Period! Look here. If I lodge a complaint with the police, you'll all be behind the bars. So leave. Do it, I say. Go and file a complaint. I'll go to prison for marrying my daughter to you. She'll go to prison for marrying you. We'll all go to prison! So, I try to settle your debt and support you… but you want to involve the police? Do we look like criminals to you? Wonderful! Nice! - You live happily. - How will he live happily? If not for us, they will be on the streets. Take the document and let's leave. - Dad, wait. - Wait a moment. Let me ask you something. If your father and my child, both are fighting for their lives. You can only save one of them. Whom will you save? I value every life equally. You don't get to say that. Your father or my child? Answer me. Dad. Dad, don't worry. Dad… Don't worry. It's okay. All of you please leave. Answer me first. Then, we shall all leave. Okay then. My father matters the most to me. Now leave. Use this also to save your father's life. - Why did you remove the nuptial thread? - Let's leave. - Dear, wait. - Wait. Why did I ever make this match and ruin this girl's life? Get up, Dad. Please get up. Dad. Please get up. Do you recognize me? If yes, then blink once. If not, then blink twice. Do you recognize me? Tell me. Do you recognize me? Dad! Raji… Dad! Dad! Give me the sari. I wish to… bear your child. Our first kiss will be after I tie the knot with you. I'll eat only your leftovers. You look great! Just like a king! Will you forgive me? - You must get back up on your feet… - And run around… - Did you hear it? - Do you recognize me? - Hi, Grandpa. - It's me. Vembu. Your pulse is just fine. Dad… You're a pearl Like the meaning of your name You're now off on a voyage As we stand and wait for you on the shores We want to believe that You're sailing towards us, oh dear We continue to wait at the shores for you You're the pearl off on a voyage, oh dear Your kith and kin are waiting for you On the shores We want to believe that You're sailing towards us, oh dear We all wait together for you to return Your smile is etched In our hearts, oh dear Our eyes have teared up now Raji… Suresh! What are you doing here at this hour? Are you leaving this village tomorrow? Yes. You will come back soon, right? I don't know. What is it? Do you know how your grandpa died? Dad! Can I ask you something?
