A steel pipe is lowered down the hole and encased in cement. They extract the water from the coal seam, which then releases the gas. The oil and gas industry's own statistics reveal that at least 5% of wells fail instantly. 50% of wells fail within 30 years, and eventually all gas wells will fail. The companies then have the option to frack the gas well. Fracking releases more gas, which makes them more money. Hydraulic fractioning is a process where they combine water, sand, and a mix of chemicals like bronopol, MAGNACIDE 575, droxymethyl, triibutyl. Jeez, can't even get it out. Then they ram this toxic mix down the gas well to fracture the coal seam to produce more gas. The water could come out extremely toxic combined with heavy metals, uranium, and all sorts of nasties. The biggest companies doing the fracking in Australia are Halliburton and Schlumberger. They're the main two. Once they get the gas out of the ground, it heads up to the central processing plant where they flare off the gas they don't want. That releases greenhouse gases and poly aromatic hydrocarbons into the atmosphere, so the government gives these companies access to your land.
