(pensive western music) (flames crackling) (horse whinnying) Eight years. Eight years and I don't recall any of you writin'. You can't read! -Where are they, Tobey? -I don't know. I didn't come all this way, wait all those years to hear that. I haven't seen 'em since the war, Holden. And I'm just a farmer now. (Holden laughing) (guns firing) Holden: Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Tobey! This is an unpardonable waste of lead! It's useless! So, why don't you just step on out? Because you'll kill me if I do. After all this time, you still don't know me. I don't wanna kill ya! I want to talk! Sorry, Holden, I just don't believe you. Believe me, because if I come for you, you're dead for sure. Okay, I'm coming out. (gun thudding) Move into the light. You look like hell, Tobey. People'll think you're the one that spent eight years in prison, not me. One more time, where are they? (gun firing) (Tobey grimacing) Guess you were right about me. Why me? Don't flatter yourself. They'll get theirs. You were just the one easiest to find. That's all. Get it over with. You're in no position to ask for favors. For the last time, Tobey. Where are they? (gun firing) Let's go. (piano music) This just came for you, Sheriff. Thanks. Damn. This was bound to happen. (reverent western music) -How ya doin'? -Whoa! Whoa, ha! Hey. Hey, you! I saw that. Stop! (pensive western music) Okay, forget it. (soft western music) (horse whinnying) (horse hooves approaching) (breathing rapidly) Who are you? Lee Walker. What do ya want? Are you Bryce? Come to help bury your father. (gun firing) That's a nice weapon. Got a lot more stopping power than that shovel. You expecting a epidemic? They were like that when I got here. He rode with you, right? He tell ya that? In passing. Wasn't a favorite topic of conversation. We were business associates, rode together a long time before the war. Can't imagine he'd wanna be buried way out here. Well, they wouldn't let me bury him in town because of the way he died. And lived. -Get in the wagon. -What for? Gonna bury him in town. Listen, I don't want any trouble-- He's your father! (soft western music) Get in the wagon! Look who's comin'. Hey, boy. Stop it right there, son. Hold that wagon. Just where might you be going, fella? Gonna give my friend a Christian burial. Well, your friend wasn't much of a Christian, and I've told the boy here that. Now, you just turn this thing around. Riding that coffin through town can spoil a lotta people's day. Not as much as I'm gonna spoil yours if you don't get outta my way. This man lead a heathen's life and died a heathen's death. As mayor of this town, I'm telling you to turn around and take him back where he came from. Well, I can appreciate the fact that you don't wanna look ignorant in front of all your friends. And being a Christian, I can probably forgive you. But I don't know if he will. (gun racking) Unless you move your self-righteous butt, this heathen rifle's gonna blow out your candle. Let's go, kid. (wagon rumbling) Mayor: Dammit, Conklin! Ya just stood there! You're paid plenty! Not enough to die. (soft western music) You another one of my father's business associates? I guess you could say that. (door thumping) I have a few questions. Hmm, well... I thought I recognized you two. Damned if I didn't. Boy, you've aged hard. These are 10 years old. We've already been pardoned for this. You couldn't get two bits for it. You see what kinda company your daddy kept? Torrance: Who killed him? Well, if I were to guess, I'd probably come up with a long list of suspects. Don't guess. Oh, you want my help? You make a fool outta me in front of the mayor and the town, and now you want my help? I don't see why I should be so lathered up to give it. You can be made worse things than a fool. Oh. (gun cocking) Well, maybe you could do me a little favor. What? There's some drunken herders at the Nugget. Now, things are bound to get nasty. Mayor doesn't want 'em there, I don't want 'em there. My deputies have been afflicted with a streak of yellow. Now, you solve my problem and I'll answer your questions. What kinda law is that? More law than you deserve. No. No, no, no, no. You boys are so tough, be unfair advantage to give you back your guns. (gun firing) Come on, dance! Dance! (light folk music) Dance, I said! (guns firing) Dance, dance! (laughing) Dance, yeah! (guns firing) Gentlemen. The mayor and the sheriff are concerned about your rowdiness. And I must admit I'm a little concerned about your manners. So, at their request, I'm asking you all to leave town now, peacefully. Thank you. Ain't you Lee Walker? Yes, sir. I thought you were dead, shot down in Amarillo. Not that I know of. Well, hell, ya look dead! (laughing) So far, you're doing just fine. That one with you, that's Jesse Ray Torrance, ain't it? That's him. Man: Where's your guns, old-timers? Well, we really didn't think we'd need 'em just to ask a favor. You two mighta got away with this 10 years ago. But from where I'm standing, you're just two old men. It could be arranged you won't be standing. Not by you two. (gun firing) Now, you're dumber than a sack full of rocks. My friend asked you nice to go. (gun firing) (gun firing) (soft folk music restarting) Now, what? (blanket unfurling) -You take the left. -Right. -No, the left. -Right. (guns firing) (table crashing) I said the left! (guns firing) (glasses breaking) (guns firing) (soft western music) It looks a lot worse than it is, kid. Torrance: That could be your epitaph. -Ya! Well, we did your dirty work for ya. Conklin: Could be a friend of yours, wouldn't it? That who you figured? He left a message for ya. He'll be in Almarilla, waiting. You knew what he did out at the ranch and didn't do anything about it? Now, you two lived on the wrong side of the law all your life, don't you expect any help from it. Just 'cause you did all your killin' during the war and got a pardon for it don't make it right with me. At least we know where the man stands, huh? Be kind enough to light this, Sheriff, if it ain't askin' too much of the law. You need a horse. This your horse? Gotcha a horse. (fuse hissing) (explosion booming) (glass shattering) Looks like it's gonna be a pretty nice day after all. -Let's go! -Ya! (reverent upbeat western music) Why'd you run off, kid? Bryce: I'd seen enough. Hell, you missed the best part. Where ya headed now? Find whoever killed my father. Well, since we know who killed him and we know where he went and he's just waiting for us to follow him down there so he can kill us, I'd say we all better go together. Yeah, I've seen what you are. I don't wanna be a part of it. Don't worry about hurtin' our feelings, kid. Everybody feels that way. Is that your daddy's coat? I've been holding something for you. Tobey scribbled in it. Thought you might want it. Some of it ain't half bad. You read it? Just the parts about me. I'll go alone. Hey! See if you can hit that branch out there. Listen, I don't need to prove anything to you. You will to Holden. (gun firing) (gun firing) Just see if you can hit the tree. (gun firing) Kid couldn't hit water if he fell out of a boat. I can fight, all right?! I was intercollegiate heavyweight champ. And I can ride. You sure he's Tobey's kid? You know, knowing he rode with people like you makes me wonder. You know he was ashamed to talk about it? And it all comes back to kill him. He dies out here trying to live a different kinda life. Tobey got killed by a guy named Holden Bonney, a guy we used to ride with. We got tired of robbing trains and banks and we heard we could get a pardon if we fought for the South, so we went for it. Holden didn't go for it. He wound up in trouble, got in jail. He wanted us to bust him out, and we couldn't do it. We was in the Army, and we'd-a got hung for it. When we got pardoned and he got jail, didn't go down too good. He felt like we were to blame. Well, he wasn't too good at figuring. I don't understand people like you. Well, it's all right not to understand us and it's all right not to like us. But to go after Holden alone is just stupid. And if you think that we're gonna not get even for what he did to our friend, that's just out and out college ignorant. (soft orchestral music) (horse whinnying) (reverent western orchestral music) Tobey: Torrance and Lee and me just left the ranch at Harden. Hardest thing I ever had to do in my whole life. Sarah looked so beautiful holding Bryce. I never saw anything like it. That baby waved to me just like I was goin' into town and comin' back before supper. Strange how life don't go the way you plan. One day, I expect I'm gonna be farming with Sarah my whole life. Instead, I'm ridin' hard with these fellas again and missin' her, wonderin' about all I'm givin' up just to keep them safe. Anything in there about me? Lee: You take the first watch. Wake me up in a couple hours. What am I watching for? Men like us. The war turned a bunch of 'em loose, grabbin' everything they can get. Hey, Lee? My father shoot anybody when he rode with you? Nobody that didn't have it comin', and never in the back. (snoring) (gun cocking) What the-- (snoring continuing) (gun firing) Kid, you better hope he kills me. Hands where I can see 'em. This isn't very smart. I'd say I got the upper hand. If you're gonna rob me, at least stand downwind. -Hector, get their horses. -All right. You can't just leave us out here without horses or guns. Watch me. (gun firing) Sleep well, gentlemen! (men hooting and hollering) -I was tired. -Mm-hmm, sure. (Bryce grimacing) Now, getting up is admirable, but dumb. (light upbeat orchestral music) (Tobey grimacing) (Tobey grimacing) Come on! (Tobey grimacing) Now, this is making me sick. Don't get up anymore. Guess that makes me intercollegiate heavyweight champion. (reverent western orchestral music) Problem. A lone rider doesn't always mean a problem. (gun firing) Everyone out here where I can see 'em. Bandit: Gimme my rifle. (gun firing) (man groaning) Boys, careful! Cowardly son of a bitch. Any other heroes? I want all money, jewelry, silver, here, where I can see it. You, make sure the ladies don't skip nothin'. (reverent western orchestral music) Not too bright, these boys. Fish in a barrel. What? Huh. What the hell? We want our things back. Put down your guns. (gun thudding) (soft folk music) Me and the others have been talkin', wonderin' if you'd ride with us to Santa Mesa. We'd pay you, of course. The way you took care of things today, well, it seems like you know your way around this sorta stuff. Well, we really do appreciate your invitation, but we're on our way to Almarilla. Have an appointment we can't miss. We could ride with you as far as Hard Edge, no charge. Well, appreciate it. Where's the young one? Where's your daughter? (soft acoustic guitar music) So, what did you go to college for? Study farming. It was only for a year. (laughing) Study farmin'? My daddy's a farmer, but I don't think he got sent to school for it. Just woke up one morning and started farming. That's the best way. But your friends, they don't look like farmers. Yeah, well, they're not my friends. We're, uh... -We're business associates. -Oh. What kinda business? We're roamers. We roam around, we help people in trouble. (laughing) -Claire? -Evening, sir. -Well, I'll see you- -Yeah. -Tomorrow. -Thank you. No, keep the jacket, please. Claire: Thanks. Goodnight. Maybe we can ride together tomorrow? Yeah! Okay. -Yeah? Okay. -Fine. (soft orchestral music) Torrance: This town's on the wrong side of ugly. Lee: You get the feelin' we got the pox? It's been a pleasure, ma'am. Enjoy the trip! Thank you. (pensive percussion music) Guess you can get her down. Thank you. You're welcome. We'll be here a couple of nights before heading on to Santa Mesa, so if you don't ride right out... Bye. If you could shoot like you kiss, you'd be one dangerous hombre. (water trickling) (uneasy music) (water splashing) Dalton? Lee? Lee: Shouldn't-a done that, I mighta killed ya. Yeah, well, it didn't look like it was gonna turn out that way. So, you're the sheriff in this town? Third one this year. Figured after we retired, there wouldn't be nobody left to chase. (laughing) Well, somehow I knew that retirement wouldn't last. Well, damn, Dalton! This is like a regular reunion! Torrance, he here too? Tobey's son. We buried Tobey. Get me a dry cigar outta my boot. Ya didn't ask me about Holden. Didn't have to. He dropped his calling card in San Carlos. Burned a farmhouse. Left a note. Somethin' about you and Torrance being no-good, sniveling cowards. Well, he killed Tobey. We're goin' after him. Sure has a good hate on for you fellas. You gentlemen do behave yourselves now, right? I mean, we don't have to start somethin' all over again, do we? I'm hurt that you'd even ask. (laughing) Habit, I guess. See me down at the two-bit. I'll buy you boys a beer. (laughing) (light western music) Tobey: This war that's comin' may change things for me. We hear talk of getting pardoned for misdeeds if we go to fight. That and the passing time might give me a whole 'nother chance. The boy's growin' up without knowin' a man's way, and I've been headin' nowhere, my heart near broke must all the time. I saw a boy today, made me think of Bryce. He looked to be the same size the boy might be by now, gettin' his first feel of the saddle, landin' on his rump a few times, growin' his first blisters. It got me to ponderin' what kind of a man he'll turn into. I expect he'll find a better way to live than always havin' a gun in his hand. (gun firing) (glass shattering) (gun cocking) (gun firing) (gun cocking) (gun firing) (children giggling) (chuckling) Torrance: It's just possible you're the worst shot I ever saw. Toss-up between you and Judge Kramer. Kramer had the advantage, though: He was blind. Try this. Walk up and stab the can? Have to get kinda close for that to do much good, don't I? Draw. What? Draw on me. Pretend I took young Claire for a roll in the hay. Go for your gun. Whenever you're ready. (knife whooshing) Nice thing about a knife is, it's hard to shoot your foot off with it. Keep it. I got another. (people talking) (light western music) May I help you? Nice bank. Lee: What are you doin' in there? You ain't got the itch again, do ya? Torrance: Always have the itch. This bank's so easy, it deserves to be robbed. (wagon rumbling) (uneasy music) (piano music) (patrons chattering) Hey, kid, while you're up, get me another beer, will ya? He left in kind of a huff. Hey, kid. What, you too? Every five minutes with that guy, it's, "Hey, kid, do this, do that." I wouldn't let it bother you. He used to call me junior for the very same reason. 'Cause he's older than us? Hell, no, he can't remember our names. (laughing) You gonna deal with your gloves on? I always deal with my gloves on. You know, I've known those men most all my life, and I can't think of anyone I'd rather have backing me up when the chips are down. You're the sheriff. You should be the last one defending 'em. Oh, I'm not defending 'em. I just rode with 'em long enough to know what kinda men they are. You rode with them? That's a fact. Probably some poster on me collecting dust somewhere. I sowed my wild oats for a while, and then they kicked me out. Guess they figured I was too young to be an outlaw. Anyway, couple years later, I found myself wearing a deputy sheriff's badge and I was chasin' them. So, I understand 'em a little better than you, that's all. Hmm. How well did you know your father? Not very, or so I'm finding out. He was a good man. Yeah. My hands are very sensitive. Fingers, the tips. I don't know what the hell you're thinkin' of, Dalton. You're the sheriff! It doesn't look good associating with riffraff. You know... You're exactly right. Better get back to my friends. That in some small way, we have contributed to the fabric of the myth and legend of us. (all laughing) Excuse me, I have to go puke. And it's behavior like that that gives us legends a bad name. Match, kid? Nope. Go get me some inside. You get 'em. (pensive western music) (gun firing) (gun firing) -Hurry it up, now! -All right, all right! Robber: I got it, I got it, I got it! -Whoa! -Move it! (Loomis groaning) Loomis: Thief! He's been shot! So have I. He's dead. (soft somber music) Dalton: Let me through. Let me through! We caught him comin' outta the bank. They shot Loomis. Their friends took off, but we got these two. -We didn't do anything. -All right, all right. We'll get to the bottom of this. Shaw, get this man over to Doc Boyle's. Aw, come on, a doctor's not gonna do him much good. Well, we're certainly not gonna leave him here. I'm gonna put together a posse to go after the men that did this. Yeah, well, let's start with these two here. We had nothin' to do with it. Oh, yes, and you should be locking him up too. Don't be stupid, Picker. You know he was drinkin' in the bar with me. Oh, yeah? Keeping you busy, you mean? What are you doing mixing with this kind, anyway? Our sheriff has been drinking in there with known criminals while their friends have been robbing our bank and killing our guard! While you're standing there yappin', they're running off with the money. Right. You gonna arrest this man, Sheriff, or am I gonna have to? Keep this before he hurts somebody. (laughing) So, what's it gonna be, Dalton? Or are we gonna have to take care of this ourselves? Come on. Come on. -Lock him up. -Lock 'em up, Sheriff. Man: Keep this town clean here. (cell door slamming) Boy: Let's go, come on! The soldiers are comin'! (horse hooves approaching) Soldier 1: Andale! Soldier 2: Federales! Just go back inside, okay? (speaking Spanish) (speaking Spanish) (speaking Spanish) (speaking Spanish) Man: What'd he say? He say he has business with a man here. (speaking Spanish) Man: What'd he say now? He say to his men to look around. They don't have all day. (speaking Spanish) Tell him this is American territory. He has no rights here. You want me to tell him that? (speaking Spanish) (speaking Spanish) (gun firing) (people conversing) I was not to wait. They were to be here. This was not the arrangement. They're older. They travel slower. Too slow. We made a deal. They were to be here. Now you want your money. You bring them to me. I'll get 'em into Cordoba. That's as far as I go. Half the money when I get there, half when you get them. They'll come. They want me dead. They hate you that much? If they don't... they will. (speaking Spanish) Crowd: All right, ya bunch of murderers! Yeah, get 'em out here, Sheriff! Can't get away with this! (townspeople clamoring) You know, I didn't do anything! Are you listening to me?! It's just a flesh wound. -Woulda killed a normal man. -Mm-hmm. What are we gonna do? I have no idea. Bryce: Oh, that's it, that's it, huh? That's all you gotta say for yourself? That pretty well sums it up. (townspeople clamoring) (soft orchestral music) (snoring) Tobey: I just got word that Sarah's come down with the consumption. I'd like to get back to her, but I don't see how I can. Truth is, now I think of Sarah and Bryce as one, my family. It was the right thing to do. I've lost count of all the trouble I've been in with Torrance, Lee, and Holden. But I do know if I'm in a scrape, they'll be there at my back, and I reckon I'll be there for them too. Seems everybody we come across these days is lookin' to kill us. I suppose that day'll come when somebody'll get it done. (door opening) (clamoring continuing) Well, after all, it is our money. You're giving up awful easy. Meaning what? Well, meaning, maybe we oughta ask your friends where their partners are. Meaning, maybe we oughta keep an eye on them ourselves. And you. (clamoring continuing) Woman: Sheriff, come on! Bryce: We're free? Sort of. Caught 'em? Nope. -What are you doin'? -Retirin'. (match striking) (fuse hissing) (explosion booming) (townspeople clamoring) (coughing) (tense western music) Bryce: I can't believe this! I'm a fugitive! Lee: Ain't it exciting? (reverent western music) Should we be stoppin'? They might be comin' after us. If they're still chasin' us, they can have me. A bottle of whisky and your plate du jour, please. What do you think you're doin'? That's the man who shot me. At the bank? Don't even think about it. Lee: Ordered the plate du jour, gentlemen. Is that somebody we know? Did we rob him or somethin'? He's the one who shot Torrance. (uneasy music) Put that away and let me deal with this. I'm the one they shot, junior. Yeah, and it's my town that they robbed. All right, look... I'm gonna go see if I can rustle up a sheriff. Nobody... Nobody starts shootin'. Come on, Torrance, wait 'til after I eat! Looking for the sheriff. I was... Still am, I guess, Sheriff of Hard Edge. Need a professional courtesy. Is he here? (cell door creaking) Well, I guess he's in no shape to help. (wind whistling) Dalton said to wait for him. (gun cocking) I'd assume to take care of this myself. I owe him one. See, that's where we differ. I bear the man no personal grudge. Besides, they look younger and quicker. Man: What the hell do you want? I want that money you took from the bank. (guns firing) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) So, you had to be the hero. (gun firing) (guns firing) Man: Put that fire out! (guns firing) Bryce: Lee. Torrance. (guns firing) I got an idea. (guns firing) Me too, shut up. (guns firing) (groaning and yelling) (gun firing) (horse whinnying) (screaming) (gun firing) Man: Lloyd! Bring them the money! Drop your gun. Get the money, kid. (gun firing) (gun racking) (gun firing) (groaning) Come on, champ. Round's over. People from Hard Edge are probably gonna come looking for this. You make sure they get it. You make sure to tell them we got it back for 'em. I don't want my reputation ruined. Don't tell 'em I had anything to do with bringin' it back. I don't want my reputation ruined either. Tobey: I'm finally goin' back. They wanted to pin some fool medal on me for the skirmish at Paxton Mill. Told 'em I wanted to go home instead. Lee and Torrance were all for it. Truth is, now I think of Sarah and Bryce as one, my family. When I first saw Sarah, she had a baby growing inside of her. I loved her and it didn't matter. I'm going back now, not just for her, but because I love both of 'em. It was the right thing I did, marryin' Sarah and takin' on another man's son. Dalton: I'll take watch tonight. Don't they trust me? Nope. (laughing) Bryce: Be my guest. Well, you gonna stare at me all night long or ask me somethin'? Well, I was... wondering about my father. Listen, I know the truth. He wrote it in his diary. So, you wanna know about the man who fathered you? No. Tobey was my father. He always will be. What I wanna know is how he got all mixed up in this kinda life. (soft music) Well, as I recall, he wasn't really lookin' for it. Just minding our own business, admiring a bank. But what we didn't realize was the bank was bein' robbed at the time. Sorta like what happened in Hard Edge. Well, Torrance got in an argument with a gentlemen who was making the withdrawal, something to the effect that the money rightfully belonged to us, we just got there a little late is all. And they didn't like Torrance's attitude and they'd probably killed us all if Tobey hadn't been so quick. But they really had it comin'. And I don't think he got any particular pleasure out of it. Right, Torrance? It was his first time, kid. So, what do we do if we catch Holden? Oh, there ain't no ifs. He sent us an invitation, he'll be there. Yeah, but, what do we do? This is a hell of a time to be worryin' about a plan. What do you think we should do? Well, he's a murderer. I mean, we should... We should bring him back and he should go on trial. Can't believe we're havin' this conversation. I think the order is we go down there and we shoot him and then we bring him back. That's the way you see it, huh? That's the way it is. He killed your father, and he's waiting to kill us. He's tried to kill us, settin' a trap for us. Maybe it'll work, maybe he'll kill us. Maybe we'll kill him first. But either way, there ain't gonna be no trial and we ain't bringin' him back. It's just him and us and a whole lotta hate. And if that don't sit right with you, you better just saddle up and ride on out. You know, I'm just not like you guys, okay? I can't just forget there are rules, whether we like 'em or not. Well, that's good. I'll do the forgettin' for both of us. (horse whinnying) (townspeople shouting) (guns firing) We'll be goin' now. A couple of men'll come lookin' for me. Lee and Torrance. Give 'em a message! Tell 'em I crossed the river, way to Cordoba. And I'll be waiting. Everybody got that? (gun firing) I'm gonna help ya remember! Get the torches! (townspeople shouting) (guns firing) Tell 'em to come to Mexico! And if they don't, I'll be back to see ya! And next time, I won't be so nice! (flames crackling) (horse hooves clopping) Morning. (soft guitar music) It slipped my memory, but did we do somethin' vile here? We're lookin' for a man named Holden. Do you know him? You Lee or Torrance? They are. I'm Bryce. (spitting) Your friend did this. -Because of you. -He's no friend. We don't want you here. They burned our church to leave you a message. What message? They'll wait in Cordoba. If you don't meet them, they'll come back, burn our whole town. But we'll be ready for them. Now, get out and do whatever dirty business it is you have to do. Lee: Now, her, I like. Look, we're sorry about your church. We're goin' after the men that did this. We'd just like to rest for a bit, maybe get something to eat. That's all we're asking. Maybe Holden burned down the cantina too. Why? Why they do this? Because they're bad men, that's why. Lee: What happened to all your help? What's it to you? Nothing. I suppose in some way we're responsible. I... We do feel bad about this. You better be going. I don't want them coming back here! Lee: Holden has waited this long. He'll wait a little longer. What's he waiting for? To kill us. But before we let that happen... (soft upbeat music) Put it in la iglesia. Hey, kid. Now I remember why we robbed banks. Why you robbed 'em. I just chased ya. I was thinking... about that man who wants to kill you. Oh, that's good. I've been too tired to think about him myself. He's setting a trap. Probably. Not just him. Meaning? A Mexican colonel rode in here, right across the river, like this was just another part of Mexico. They talked a while, and then the colonel and his men rode out. It is a trap, right? Yes. But you're still gonna go? After all the work we've done, I don't want him to come back and burn more buildings. ♪ She had blue eyes ♪ ♪ She had brown eyes ♪ ♪ She had eyes that could see through your soul ♪ ♪ She was hardcore ♪ ♪ But she gave more ♪ ♪ Every time that you bought what she sold ♪ ♪ They were drifters and dreamers ♪ ♪ A town full of schemers ♪ ♪ With dreams that you hope won't come true ♪ ♪ Sellers and buyers ♪ ♪ Losers and liars ♪ ♪ And you're glad that you're just passin' through ♪ ♪ Hard Edge ♪ ♪ Is a hard town ♪ ♪ But she let me come in from the cold ♪ ♪ And for one night ♪ ♪ It was all right ♪ ♪ She gave me somebody to hold ♪ ♪ And for one night ♪ ♪ It was all right ♪ ♪ She gave me somebody to hold ♪ ♪ And for one night ♪ ♪ It was all right ♪ ♪ She gave me somebody to hold ♪ Lee: Well, this is it, boys, the point of no return. Dalton: Over there's Mexico. That's a bad place for you two. Remember, you haven't been pardoned over there. Bryce: You robbed banks in Mexico too? Torrance: We had a little trouble with geography. Lee: Actually, it was a train we robbed in Mexico. Dalton: No matter. Still a price on your head over there. Torrance: You don't have to cross, but we do. Lee: Let's do this one for Tobey, boys! Torrance: For Tobey! (reverent western music) (faint roosters crowing and dogs barking) Bryce: Doesn't look like much of a town. Lee: Eh, it ain't much of a town, but I'd like to get a little look in there to see what Holden's got planned for us. I'll go in. Well, you can't go, and he doesn't know me. You still risk gettin' your head shot off. That's a chance we'll have to take. (church bell ringing) (pensive music) Hey, kid. (door opening) (eerie music) Do I know you? What are ya doin' here? (gulping) Ridin' through. Yep. Well... Just keep doin' that. (men laughing and speaking Spanish) My deal was half now, half when you have 'em. Colonel: That deal was made in another country, and you and your men will stay out of our way. You got it? Amigo. When this is over, remind me to shoot this idiot. (speaking Spanish) What are you doing? Lee: Go on, get outta here, get! Bryce: Hey, hey! We're gonna need them! -How do you figure? -To ride outta here. You don't honestly think we're gonna ride outta this, do ya? Let's just say the odds ain't exactly in our favor. Then why are we goin' in if we can't get Holden? I didn't say we wasn't gonna get Holden, I just said we probably won't be ridin' out again. Which is why you aren't goin' in. You guys are crazy. Probably. You're just gonna go in there and get killed. What... What good's that gonna do? Huh? (gun racking) Holden won't be comin' out. Not too many other choices. Dalton: Holden knows them pretty well. He knew they'd cross river. He knew they'd come in after him. Can always count on them to do the right thing, even if they came at it strange. It's what kept 'em alive. Now it's gonna kill 'em. Can't you stop 'em? Dalton: Who, me? What do you expect them to do? These aren't men that are gonna die on some farm somewhere. Truth of it is, they'd rather go out like this than any other way. That goes for me too. Yeah, well, you're crazy too. They're doin' this for your father. He'd-a done the same for them. (soft somber guitar music) (men laughing and speaking Spanish) Colonel: Because we do business together does not mean I have to eat with you. (soft uneasy music) Lee: Well, good luck, guys. Torrance: Yeah, you too. Dalton: See ya later for a drink. (match striking) (groaning) (speaking Spanish) (speaking Spanish) You remember or you'll be breathin' out your throat. (speaking Spanish) (speaking Spanish) (speaking Spanish) (speaking Spanish) (speaking Spanish) (footsteps approaching) (gun cocking) Amigo! Hola. (rising dramatic music) (gun firing) (Dalton screaming) (gun firing) (man screaming) (guns firing) (man screaming) Dalton: Cover me! (guns firing) (man groaning) (guns firing) Torrance! (guns firing) (Torrance groaning) (gun firing) (Dalton grimacing) (guns firing) (horse whinnying) You're shot bad, Torrance. (gun firing) (man groaning) Nice shot. (gun firing) I'm goin' for Dalton. Hey, kid! (gun firing) (Torrance grimacing) (guns firing) (Lee grimacing) Holden! Damn you, Holden! You miserable coward! Why don't you fight your own fights?! Man: No mas! What are you starin' at? Holden! Holden! (door opening) You. Who the hell are you? Look around you. You're not walkin' away from this. At least the name. I don't like to kill someone without knowin' their name. Bryce Naylor. You killed my father. I'm taking you in, it's over. I don't think so. (gun firing) (sobbing) (gun thudding) (gun firing) (Bryce groaning) Holden: Let's see if you make the same squealin' sound your father made when he died. (Holden groaning) (Bryce grimacing) (wagon approaching) Lee: Bryce. Lee? Lee. -Lee, I thought you were dead. -Yeah, so did I. Come on. Lee, I'll get ya to a doctor across the border. Dalton? Torrance is alive! Lee: Of course he is. He's too mean to kill just by shootin' him. Come on. (Torrance grimacing) (soft orchestral music) I understand now why my father rode with you. I hope you understand why I can't. Guess the apple didn't fall too far from the tree after all. Lee: Your father woulda been mighty proud of ya out there today. Yeah, I reckon I'm a lot more like him than I thought. Gonna go back to the farm. Maybe even stop in Santa Mesa. (Bryce grimacing) See a girl. Lee: Drop me off in Almarilla. Tobey: This is the last time I'll be writing in this book, seein' as how tomorrah I'll be goin' back to the farm. I'm too late to join my Sarah, although I know one day I will. I've made my mistakes, but I think I did the best I could. But Bryce, you can do better. I'd be mighty proud to know that you took a different path and found a little happiness because of it.
