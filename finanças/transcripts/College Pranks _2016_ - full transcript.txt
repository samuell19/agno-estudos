I can't imagine you have any problem with girls, - Just meeting the right one, Well, have you given any more thought to our alliance? - Well, I know you and Trevor won't be allies, - What? Me and Trevor? I love the guy, like a fungus or something, [laughing] - Yeah, okay, I could go for an alliance, But the 25 K is all mine, - Okay, shake on it, [lips smacking] - Or kiss, Either way we'll seal the deal, - I'd really like to see you when we get back at school, - Yeah, I'd like that, - Oh wow, [laughing] It's the beers, they're really kicking in, I'm tired, - Well, good luck tomorrow, At least enough to come in second, - Yeah, good luck to you, - Night! - Good night, [peaceful instrumental music] [zipper buzzes] - Who took my stuff? - Relax, you've never gotten drunk and been markered before? - There's no way I was that drunk last night, - I think we were drugged, You guys remember feeling groggy? - So they could go through our stuff, - [Trevor] Yup, upping up the ante now, Cell phones are all gone, too, - And they took my clothes, what the hell! - Oh, and we got this; Coordinates to our first challenge, Says we gotta go that way, - Let me see it, - Hey, that's mine! - Relax! No, we gotta go that way, Magellan, Yeah, [ominous instrumental music] - [Jeff] Hey, watch out! [Laughing] - Those are my clothes, This isn't funny, This isn't funny anymore! Do you hear me? [Ominous instrumental music] Hello? Is anyone here? - This is definitely it, - I am not going in there, - What, giving up on the 25 G? - I'm already over these pranks, - Hey, check it out, Welcome to the first challenge, Pick two players to enter the Cave of Doom! - [Jeff] That sounds ominous, - Looks like they're gonna lock us in, - Yeah, I'm staying out here, - [Jeff] I'll go, - Alright, we got our first volunteer, I'll go with you, - Hey, don't I get a vote? You trying to steal my prize money? - Cam, enough! - Why don't you just stay out here and keep Jenn company? Can you do that? - You know what? That sounds like a good idea, [bag thuds] - Let's go, - You know, I coulda taken him, Lucky for him, my index finger's my Achilles Heel, [ominous instrumental music] So, Jenn, what brought you here? - What else, the money, And I wanted to challenge myself, - What, living a life of quiet desperation? - Aren't we all? - And we all have a story, What's yours? - When my dad died, my mom got very protective of us, She made us take walkie-talkies to the grocery store which was only two blocks away, And we'd have to hold hands and talk to her the whole time, It was so embarrassing, - Well, at least your mom cared, - She does, It's just time to move on, So why are you here? - The cheese, I'm tired of eating Ramen noodles and cat food all day, At least, I think it was cat food, - [laughs] Well, at least you have two of the four food groups, [ominous instrumental music] [gate clatters] - What, you scared? It's just bamboo, Well, move along, my fellow spelunker, [ominous instrumental music] - That's it; dead end, - [Cam] Now look, what's that? Should I push the button? - [Jeff] Well, I mean, I guess it's part of the game, - [Cam] Right? Alright, - [Jeff] Wait, wait! [Gasps] - The gate, - So, when this thing wraps up, how 'bout you and I connect for a drink later? - I'm busy [sighs], I knew this would happen, - [Trevor] It's probably nothing, Maybe it's an elimination round, - [Jeff] What's it counting down to? - Hopefully opening the gate, - What the hell does boom mean? - Boom, a bomb, Like a stink bomb, like in junior high, Like, a liquid fart, Let's just get out of here 'cause I don't wanna smell like ass in front of Jenn, - Before the countdown reaches one minute, the button must be pressed and held or the bomb explodes, - Bomb, see, like a stink bomb, Let's just figure out a way to get out of here, It's probably gotta be like one of those room escape games, you know, you play online? - At 30 seconds, the gate will open allowing one player free, [timer beeping] The C4 will detonate at the end of the countdown, - C4? Like, I mean, well, that's gotta be a prank, - [Jeff] Thanks for playing, College Prank Team, - What the hell kind of prank is that? - I don't know, but we have less than three minutes, - Well, somebody's gotta push the button then, - You pressed it, not me, - No, we both decided to push it, - On what planet? I said, wait, Both of us don't have to die, - [Cam] Fuck, fuck! Ah, fuck! Alright, what do we do, what do we do? Oh man, - It's not depressing the button enough; it's too big, And these aren't heavy enough, - [Cam] Alright, alright, Look, okay, you should push the button, I mean, you've already done terrible things, right? You admitted it, - Who gave you the right to play God? - If you look at it from a utilitarian standpoint, who's got more to offer society, huh? - That's bullshit! You had everything handed to you, - [Cam] That doesn't change the facts, - What facts? If I'd of been in the same place, I would've done the same or more! - Well, that's not really the issue now, is it? - Every Saint has a past, And every sinner has a future, You're still no Saint, - What? Look, we got one minute to push this button or we both die, - I deserve to live! - [Cam] Why's that? - Because I believe in God and you don't! - I never said I don't believe in God, I just think we choose our own fate, - How do you choose your fate now? - I don't know, Look, I don't know, I can't decide this on my own, Look, whoever set up this death trap wants one of us to decide the fate for both of us, - [Jeff] So much for your free will theory, huh? - Look, we got 30 seconds to push a button, huh? Or we both die, Who's it gonna be? - [Trevor] So, if you and I were the last two people on earth because of a natural disaster, what would you think would happen to the human race? - [Jenn] Humanity probably wouldn't survive, [gate clicks] Cam? [Timer beeping] - [Cam] Get out of the way! Get down! [Explosion booms] - [laughs] What the fuck? - Whoa, what the? What just happened, dude? - Is that a fucking bomb, or what? [Explosion booms] [gasping] - Where's Jeff? - This isn't a game anymore, That was a real bomb in there, [groaning] - Trevor! Can you hear me? Are you okay? I don't get it; why are they trying to kill us? - I don't know, okay? Alright, we gotta get him to the hospital, And then we gotta call the police, Come on, help him up, [ominous instrumental music] [groaning] - We have to get him down the mountain, - Yeah, but he's gotta be able to walk; I can't carry him, Fuck, - Shit! We are not playing anymore, you fuckers! - Alright, okay, it says there's a marker right over there, Wait here, alright? Wait with Trevor, I'll be right back, - Shit, shit, shit, shit! [Sighs] It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, - Here, Look, [ominous instrumental music] - Mom? [Shrieks] Mom? [Screams] - Jenny! Jenny, you have to finish the game! If you don't continue, they're gonna kill me! Jenny, help me! - Why are they doing this? - [Jenny's Mom] Help me! [Jenny's Mom screaming] - Okay, I don't know, This is way off the reservation, - We need to get help, The cameras, the cameras, I got on the train at Union Station, And I got off at-- [static crackles] - Man, I don't know what the fuck is going on right now, I don't know, man, [camera beeping] - Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Alright, Our coordinates are different, That means they want us to split up, Hey, Trevor? Trevor? Can you hear me? You there? - What happened, where's Jeff? - He's dead, - [Trevor] And the money? - No-- - [Trevor] I knew it, - Look, buddy, we gotta leave you here for a little bit, alright? Alright, stop, it's not too much further till we gotta split up, What? - My dad's picture, It's gone! - [Cam] It's just a picture, right? - No, it's, Trevor, I had it when we were with Trevor, - Okay, alright, look, calm down! We haven't gone very far, let's just go back, - [Jenn] Fine, - I don't know, man, Cops say they're trying to track the website feeds, but they keep bouncing all over the globe, I don't know what the fuck is going on, man, - Where's Trevor? - I don't know, [ominous instrumental music] [thunder rumbles] I've never seen so much blood, I couldn't even make anything out, - Trevor? Look at this, Let's get out of here, What happened in the cave with you and Jeff? - He let me go, - He gave his life for you, - Yeah, I can't explain why, - Mine say to go this way, - Look, I don't think we should split up, - We have to, We have to follow the rules, for my mom, - Be careful, [ominous instrumental music] [sniffles] [insects chirping] [sobbing] [ominous instrumental music] Cam, what are you doing? It's you! Why are you doing this? - No, Jenn, no, Jenn, I found the knife in a box where they sent me, They're watching us, Somewhere, What did you find? [Box clatters] Inside you'll find two syringes filled with rohypnol, What's rohypnol? - They want us knocked out, - Are you kidding me? I'm not fucking injecting myself with that shit, - Keep reading, - You have five minutes to inject each other, If you're still awake after that time, your mother dies, Do you really think, if we inject ourselves, then we get to walk out of this alive? - I don't know, But what choice do we have? - We've all got choices, Life is a game of choices, and we're playing the game right now, Look, I say we go to the bottom of the hill, we get the cops, we come back up here-- - No, time is running out for my mother, - Okay, I said I would be here for you and your mom, remember? - I have to follow the rules, - What you have to do is decide what's right, And I can help you with that, You gotta trust me, Jenn, We're on the same team, - We both have to do it; we don't have a choice, [branch breaks] Please, Just do it, - You know I could take that from you in one second? - Please! [Ominous instrumental music] [syringe clatters] [sobbing] [sighs] [sighs] [gasping] [ominous instrumental music] - You have no patience! - You are such a fucking liar! - I'm a fucking liar? No-- - We're done, [dull thud] [ominous instrumental music] [gasping] - No! - [Cam] Jen, Jen, where are you? - Cam? [Gasping] I'm in a coffin; they buried my alive, - Same, - Cam, I saw him, I saw the Hangman, - [Hangman] Good evening, players, Welcome to the last stage of the game: Final Prank, It's my honor to facilitate such an exciting finale, So here are the rules: Both of you have 10 minutes of air, Both of you are six feet underground, You must answer three questions right to survive the game, A correct answer takes away two minutes away from your opponent, - I'm gonna fucking kill you! - [Hangman] Better save your breath, Because the countdown begins now, First question, let's see how well you know your fellow players, Not everybody comes from money like daddy's boy, Cameron, Some of us didn't get the choice of the best possible college, What college did Trevor attend? - Fuck you! Fuck you, what kind of question is that? - Why are you doing this to us? [Sobs] - [Hangman] Take your time, What little you have, - Worton, he went to Worton College, - [Hangman] Excellent, Cam, you are correct, Next question: Which one of your fellow players is a true murderer? - You're the only murderer here! - [Hangman] Now, now, Jenn, be truthful, I've read your diary, - [Cam] Jenn, what's he talking about? - How long have you been following us? - [Hangman] Tick-tock, time's a wasting, Who is the real killer here? - You are, Trevor, you are! So give it up already, you hear me? - I am, I'm the murderer, [sobbing] - [Cam] Jenn, what are you saying? - [Hangman] Points for honesty, And Cam loses two minutes of oxygen, And we're tied going into the last stage of the game, As a bonus, I'm gonna take away three minutes from the loser, - You worthless piece of shit! I hope you rot in hell! - [Hangman] Final question: Which one of you deserves to live? - Damn you! [Sobbing] - Jenn, Jenn does, - Cam, no! - [Hangman] I underestimated you, Cameron, That's very noble of you, - Cam, you shouldn't have, - [sobs] Jenn, Jeff saved me earlier, and now, well, you got a lot more to lose, Jenn, take good care of your mom, okay? - [Hangman] Loved ones, your fate has been sealed by the passing of your loved ones, I'm sure you'd like an explanation, But I'd rather you die wondering why, And Cam, think about how you got here, Who's choice really was it? I bid you adieu, - [Cam] Fuck you, just let me out of here for one fucking minute, - No, no, Cam, don't, Save your air, you don't have a lot of time [sobbing], - Mother fucker! You know, I shoulda gone to my family reunion instead, - Yeah, so you could be with your cousin, Shelby, - And my dad, he really goes all out for these things, You should come next time, - Yeah, I'd like that, And I'll bring my mom, - I hope she likes Italian, - She loves it, - We'll have a really good time, - Cam? [Gasping] - I feel like I'm under water, - Cam? [Gasping] Cam? [Gasping] Cam? [Gasping] Cam? Cam? [Sobbing] Cam? [Sobbing] [groaning] No, no! [Sobbing] No! [Sobbing] No! [Gasping] [air hissing] - This is how it's gonna be, huh? This is how it's gonna fucking be, okay, every goddamn time, - Fucking liar! - Every fucking time, Every time you pull this shit, [Mother shrieking] No, I'm fucking over this, I'm fucking over this, [engine revs] - [Mother] Really, you're such a fucking liar, [ominous instrumental music] - Oh, my God! [Crickets chirping] [ominous instrumental music] - [Hangman] Good evening, Jenn, Welcome to the final good bye, - [gasping] Who are you? - [Hangman] Your fate, or destiny, Whatever you'd like to call me, - And Jeff? And Trevor? What did you do to them? [Ominous instrumental music] Jeff? I thought you were-- - A martyr? A fool? An orphan? I wasn't always, You see, my mother, she had a social worker who helped her find a job, Your father, Peter Maddux, He helped her, More than he should have, They started having an affair, But you already know that part, Your diary was very illuminating, I just though he'd hit her that night and left her die on the side of the road like some wild animal! But now we know better, - Cameron, you killed Trevor and him because of me? - Don't flatter yourself, Fate decided to intervene in more than one way, Cam was my half brother, - You're crazy! - Doubt if you knew it, but Conrad, our father, he did, he doesn't even know my name! And Cam had the life I shoulda had, - Why kill your brother? - So my father would know the heartbreak and torture of losing part of his family! - Well maybe if your mother wasn't sleeping around with-- - Don't you speak of her like that, [sighs] - My mom, why? - Simple: You took my mother, I took yours, Eye for an eye, And as you can see, she makes a great stand in, [Jenn sobbing] Choices have their consequences, Not to say I didn't lead you a bit, You and Cam, The writings on the mirror, the car trouble, He was just as money hungry, And Trevor, what about him? Lo and behold, who's face popped up on our website, other than our good friend, Trevor? Talk about predetermination, When I was in middle school he used to carry a double-sided quarter, both heads, And he'd say, "I'm giving you a choice "by flipping this coin," But he'd choose heads first, every time, So I gave him a choice I never had: A true blue, 50/50, and he chose heads, like always, He chose poorly, [knife squishes] [ominous instrumental music] I had more plans for Trevor, but after he got hurt outside of the cave-- [gasping] - You are a coward and a hypocrite, - Agreed, - You think you can play with other peoples' lives? - What's done is done, Our paths are set, I'm in God's hands now, - No, You're in mine, Up! - Very appropriate, Indeed, you're finally learning how to play the game, I'll tell you what, I'll make it easy, [laughing] Looks like God has the final prank, [gun firing] [dramatic instrumental music] [sobbing] - [Maggie] That's a crazy story, - Right? - So, some kid created a fake reality show just to get these guys up here that he hated, so he could kill them? - Yes! - There's no way that's true, - [Maggie] It's ridiculous, - What the fuck? - Come on, man, what is this? Did you set this up? - No, [ominous instrumental music] - Maggie, you must have set this up? - No, I didn't, I swear, - Alright then, I'm just gonna go kick his ass, - Come on, don't go out there, Just turn around, - Jack, get back in the car! [Door clatters] - [Maggie] Jack! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Holy shit! Maggie, get in the back seat! [Screaming] - Oh, my God, oh, my God! Oh, my God!
