It's her I mean. "Hi, Liam." You're so funny. Ugh, enough with the PDA. Come on, skedaddle. You've been hogging her all year. I'm sorry. My high maintenance friends need me. I'll see you after class. Okay. -Mm. -Hi, Angie. Ah...hey, eyes off my boyfriend's butt. It does have an effect on me. Ugh, it has an effect on half of the girls in the school. I don't know how you do it, Nicki. You don't know how I do what? How do you not go crazy over jealousy? -Why would she be jealous? -She said it herself. Half the girls in the school would throw their panties at Liam if he asked. -He's not going to ask. -But if he did. Okay, that may be a problem with the guys that you've dated, but not me, or Cass. It's true. Isaac and I have been together since freshman year. You know why? Trust. Okay, ew. A four-year relationship in high school? -God, you're sick. -Or maybe Nicole and I view trust a little differently than you. Okay, computer nerd. So you're telling me if some super hot, homecoming queen type were to throw herself at Liam, -that he'd just say no? -That's what we're telling you. -Are you sure? -Pretty sure. What about next year? He's going out of state for basketball, and long distance hardly ever works. What are you gonna do? The girls aren't gonna act any different than they do here. You've been burned by one too many boyfriends to have an impartial opinion on this. Guys are simple with simple needs. And if their needs can be met in a simpler way than a relationship, -there's not much hope. -Nicole, don't listen to her. Take that, for instance. Now, if I was like Angie, I wouldn't feel comfortable with him talking to another girl. Correct. I'd kill him. I trust Isaac because he's never given me a reason not to. And Liam has never given you a reason not to either. Hi. Wanna go? Hi. So much of journalism, and any kind of writing, is about being cooped up inside on your laptop. But to really tell a story, to cover something accurately, you need to live life. Get out, be curious. Find those stories. Find those people that will help you tell the story right. And, of course, when you're doing your interviews, always get everything on tape. You never want to misquote anyone. See you all tomorrow. Nice lecture, Ms. Ramos. Thanks, and "mom" is fine when there's no other students around. By the way, um, no one gets anything on tape anymore. -It's all digital now. -Except you using my old equipment. Old school, more my style. Are you calling me old? Mm. How's the article coming along? Oh, fine, I mean, the deadline's kind of kicking my butt. I was actually hoping that maybe you could... Give you an extension? Not a chance. You can do this. How's it going with Liam? Oh, he's great. Really great. You don't seem so happy about that. He's so great that every girl on campus thinks that he's great too. Nicole, are you... Jealous? Yeah, totally. Well, jealousy happens, but you have to trust each other. If you don't, it'll tear you apart. And I would hate to see you and Liam lose what you have over some silly jealousy. Did you know what dad was doing when he... Honey, is that what this is about? I don't want to see you going through life thinking that all men are like that just because your father was. -Knock-knock. -Principal Lockhart. I am so sorry to interrupt. Hello, Nicole. Uh, I was wondering if I can have a quick word -with you, Ms. Ramos. -I was just leaving. -How's your day? -It's good now. I have a reservation tonight at that new place on main. I just have no one to go with me. -I'll go. -I'll pick you up at 7:00. -Okay. -You look amazing today. Ah, thanks. Hm. -Everything okay? -Yeah, I'm fine. -Who is it? -Oh, it's no one. Well, it can't be no one. It's just someone from the team. I thought maybe it was Diane. Diane? I saw you two talking after class. I thought maybe she was texting you. How would Diane have my number? Maybe you gave it to her. I don't give my number to other girls. I have a girlfriend. Is this what it's gonna be like every time I get a text? I don't know, Liam. All right. -Where are you going? -I'm going home, all right? I had a feeling that this was gonna happen, but I don't have time to deal with your jealousy, Nicole. It's not fair. Angie says that's your type. Hello, Heather. "What's up?" -You're a genius. -Ugh, I feel awful. Why? This proves you can trust Liam. -What's awful about that? -Mm, because I betrayed -his trust. -Okay, he shot Heather down. He's proved he's faithful and he's none the wiser. And kudos to you on this profile. It looks totally legit. Why couldn't you just trust him? Heather Harris? Where did you even come up with that? I just made it up. Can I have my phone back? Oh my god. You sent him a nude? What? Who knows that she had this nice of a body from that pic? Okay, it's not her. It's just a random picture I found online. Look at you. Sneaky. Found a pic with no face so he wouldn't know. You're good. Hey, can I have the password? I just started talking to this new guy, Devin, and I want to use it on him. No. I'm deleting it. Why? This is perfect. It's not right, Angie. If it's not right, then why'd you use it? There. You're in. Thank you. Oh my god. Mornin', ladies. Morning. I've got to get going. Thanks, Nicki. Uh, I wanted to apologize for last night, okay? I overreacted and... No. I'm sorry, really. I don't want you to worry about that stuff. You can trust me. I know I can. I love you. Come here. You gonna get that? When you and I finally get some alone time, -it's a no-phone zone. -Okay. Mm, look at you, miss popular. What is it? Oh, just some stupid app. Okay. -Hey, babe. -Hey, mom. How'd it go with Liam? Oh, we're great. Are you sure? Positive. Figured. I mean, practice was over, what, two hours ago? And you're just now getting home. Sorry, mom. I am too young to be a grandma. -You know that, right? -Mom! I trust you. Relax. -Thanks. -Mm-hm. -Goodnight. -Get your laundry out. Finally you call me back. You would not believe what happened. Let me guess, it involves flashback. I dmed Devin and he shot Heather down. Can you believe that? He shot Heather down. Ew, don't call her by her real name, that's weird. -She's not real. -But you wanna know the crazy part? Isaac totally flirted back. You messaged Isaac? Yeah, I wanted to put the trust that he and Cass had to the test. And the way that he was talking to me, it seems like the trust is just a one-way street. Angie, this isn't right. Okay, you tell me what's worse: Using the profile like this or what Isaac is doing to Cass? However you slice it, Isaac is not the guy that Cass thinks he is. Let's just talk about this tomorrow. Don't stress, Nicki, we're not the bad guys here. We have to tell her, Nicki. I mean, how would you feel if it was Liam and we didn't tell you? -I know, but... -Hey. What's up? Cass, we need to talk. Okay. Remember that profile that Nicole made and what she created it for? Yeah. Well, I messaged Devin and luckily everything was okay. See? You betrayed his trust for nothing. Yeah, but I messaged someone else too. Who? I don't know how else to tell you this, but Isaac was into her. We thought you should know. It was the right thing to do. Trust me. She has to know. You are such a liar. You don't think I saw those dms? -It was online. -No. Don't even. No. After four years of dating, how could you do this to me? -I'm so sorry, I di... -Don't. Then we'll go to Tuesday. Make sure you bring it. All right, everyone, we have a new student joining us today. I know it's a little late in the school year, so let's make sure we make a good impression quickly for her. Please welcome Heather Harris. Hey, everybody. Is there anything you want to tell the class about yourself? No, I think you've embarrassed me enough already. I don't know. Like, at this point I'm gonna be thrown off the team. Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. -So see you later. -See ya. We need to talk. Yeah, sure. I just saw Heather. Like the profile. No, I don't mean online. I mean, I saw her in person in class. Look, if you're trying to punk me just because you're still mad, I don't have the time. Look. Oh my god, it's her. That's what I'm telling you. What is she doing here? I have no clue. Hi. -Nicole, right? -Hi. I think we have journalism together. I'm Heather Harris. Nicole Ramos. -Ramos, as in Ms. Ramos? -She's my mom actually. That must be nice, having your mom as your teacher. Some days. Uh, know anywhere for a good caffeine pick-me-up around here? Uh, yeah, there's a good coffee shop five minutes away, 20 if walking. So, do you have five minutes? My treat. Sure, let's go. Great. Coffee is my life. So, you just moved here? Bad timing, I know. Right at the end of senior year. Any reason for that? Um, family issues. I can get that. It was a tough decision, but it really was for the best. What school were you at? Gibson. But, then again, you already knew that or you observed it, I guess. Oh. I slept in this morning, so I just threw on my old track shirt. It's probably taboo to wear your old school shirt to your second day at your new school, but whatever. You ran track? Because of my mom. She wanted me to have a hand in everything extracurricular for colleges. She really wants me to have that perfect life, you know, and I really want to get that for her. I'm kind of the same way. My mom was an investigative journalist and then she was promoted to editor. She was kind of a big deal for a while. That's why I want to be a journalist, follow in her footsteps. You any good? Uh... I mean, I like to think so. I have been working on this article for half the semester. And if the article does well, it could mean scholarships, better journalism programs in college. Wow, you have a lot riding on that. But no pressure, right? -Right. -Yeah. So what class do you have next? -Oh. -Whoa! -Ah! -Watch where you're going. Watch where I'm going? Are you serious? Oh my... -Nicole? -Are you okay? Yeah, I guess. I don't know how I'm gonna get this cleaned. You two know each other. Yeah. Besties since, like, seventh grade, sweetie. Who are you? Oh, I'm Heather Harris. Is that your real name? Real name? What's that supposed to mean? It means you're lying. Why would I lie about my name? I don't know, but I know your name is not Heather. And how would you know that? Nicole, I think your friend's confused. Or maybe she's just crazy. I'm gonna figure out who you are. -And when I do... -You'll what? Okay, let's go, Angie. Thank you for the coffee. Mm, see you in class. Hey, Heather. Friend me on flashback, yeah? Oh, actually, I don't do the whole social media thing, you know, that's how you get yourself in trouble. Right. I was about to get some answers. You were about to punch her in the face. Yeah, this girl is trying to punk us. It's the Internet, that's what happens. But she kept alluding to things about the profile. Interests, activities. She even said she ran track. Tons of girls run track, Nicki. Trust me, it's all a prank. I know, but why now? I mean, we deleted the profile weeks ago. What? It's still open. What are you talking about? I deleted it myself. Before you deleted it, I removed your email address and added mine. All I had to was re-log in and it was back. I mean, I even blocked your profile so you couldn't find Heather's. 'Cause I've been using it. Using it for what? There are girls like you, worried like you were with Liam. You're still baiting guys with it? That's what we created Heather for. Hmmm, how many? How many what? How many girls have you baited guys for? What'd you change the password to? Don't tell Nicki. Cute. Pull up the dms. We can just delete the account from here. We don't have to, like... You're doing this for girls at other schools? I thought I was doing good. Oh...what? Let me try. It's like someone hacked the account. Good thing we have a friend who knows computers. Come with me. What are you talking about? Cass. There's no way that she'll talk to us. We have to try, okay? Just...be nice. Hey, Cass. Cass. What's going on? Uh, we just hadn't spoke in a while and we wanted to say hi. Oh. How have you two been? Semester's been crazy but good. How are you and Liam? We're doing great. Boy, who would've thought the three musketeers would be struggling for small talk? Um... You know, I'm not really feeling like walking today. Maybe give us a ride like old times? Sure. Okay! Oh, uh, hey. You're, uh, you're Heather, right? Get your hand off me. Whoa. Well, I didn't mean anything by it. Look, I, uh, want to have a little chat with you. About? About that, you know, conversation we had a couple of months ago. What about it? Well, yeah, you seemed pretty interested in me then. Well, now you're here, it seems like fate. Didn't you have a girlfriend then? Uh, I...I did, but not now. Free as a bird. I'm not interested in being your rebound hookup. Come on. I'm not asking for a rebound, all right? I'm over her. Really? You two were together for four years and you're over her in less than a month? Look. She and I were never really that serious. You weren't? Well, not to me at least. So, did you sleep with other girls when you were with Cass? Sorry, how do you know her name? Bad things should happen to bad guys like you, Isaac. It's a coincidence. Nothing more. So you're telling me out of all of the schools in the country the girl from the profile just happens to come to ours, right before graduation too? It's not like she's from the moon. She went to Gibson. That's in the valley, a 45-minute drive. Okay, but she's using the same name that Nicole created for her. Well, Heather's a common name. Maybe Nicole saw the name Heather on the profile she stole the pictures from and subconsciously used it. I don't know, maybe. See? Maybe. I think you're both overreacting. No way. This is real. It may be a hoax, but it's real. We just have to figure out what her game is. Maybe it's guilt. Guilt? For creating that profile. Stealing someone's identity to use for less-than-good means. Could be. No. I have no guilt over this. Seriously? I don't. We don't. What we did with that profile was good, and it helped a lot of girls. You, of all people, should understand that. What's that supposed to mean? You know what it means, Cass. Don't say that. -I mean it. You should be... -Don't say that. No way, we're not doing this. Get away from my car. What? Not you. Get away from my car. Whatever. Are you okay? Yeah, let's go. Loser security guard. Hey, you got a problem, man? Hi, mom. I had a really good day today. New school is going well. I promise I'll make you proud of me again. I know your secret. You're dating Liam DeLuca. How's that a secret? I don't know, I figured it must be if we had our whole coffee trip and you didn't tell me you were dating the hottest guy in school. Didn't want to brag, I guess. I would. He's hot. Like so hot. Guys like him can be dangerous. Dangerous? Girls get brutally competitive over guys like Liam, like a trophy. Wanna make sure no one steals him. Fingers crossed. So, what's with the notebook and ancient tape recorder? Wouldn't a laptop be easier? Oh, the tape recorder was my mom's, and, I don't know, I like the old school stuff. Something about a pen and paper makes me feel like a real writer. Plus, computers can crash. And notebooks can get lost. Can I have everyone's attention, please? This is a difficult announcement to make, so I'm just gonna come out and say it. Last night, Isaac dunning was struck by a vehicle in our parking lot. Now, fortunately, he did survive. And the doctors seem to think he's gonna be okay. However, his leg was shattered in multiple places and they're not quite sure when he's gonna be able to walk again. Now, unfortunately, our security cameras failed to pick up the event, and the driver of the vehicle took off and just left him there alone. Any information that you guys have that could be helpful in finding the driver, of if you'd just like to talk, my door is always open. Thank you. This is awful. I don't know. I heard he was a bad guy. Did you hear? Yeah, Cass must be a wreck. I tried calling her, but she didn't answer. Do you have the same sick feeling I do? Like a certain new transfer student had something to do with this? Yeah, I do. She reacted so weird when principal Lockhart announced the news. Weird how? She seemed irritated that Isaac was still alive. She's behind this, I can just tell. Hey, guys. Do you mind? We're having a conversation. Oh, I was just wondering if either of you knew how Cass was doing. You know Cass? I'd like to think we're friends. Right. I mean, you wouldn't really know, after that fight you guys had. How would you know? Oh, she and I chat a lot after class. I know a lot, actually. Listen, I don't know who you really are or what you're doing here, but you need to back off. Cass was right. You really are such a bitch. Okay. Stay the hell away from us. -Oh my god. -Oh, I'm so sorry. No, no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay, uh... -Say a prayer. -Okay, okay. And? Oh, thank god. -I'm Liam. -Oh, uh, we met before. I'm Heather. Heather... Sorry, don't recognize you. Oh, I'm new. I just transferred. Hm. So, how do we know each other? Oh, it's super embarrassing actually. Try me. Um, well, we've never met in person before. I mean, I've seen you when you played against my old school, but we've only ever spoken online. I messaged you on flashback a couple months ago. Oh, that Heather. I'm really sorry about that, by the way. It wasn't till I got here that I realized you had a girlfriend, so that was totally inappropriate of me. I had no idea, but Nicole is so sweet. -You know Nicole? -We have journalism together. I just feel so bad about the whole thing. I can't imagine what Nicole must think about me. Don't worry about it 'cause I never mentioned it to her. You never told her about it? I figured it wasn't important. So, I guess this is our little secret now, isn't it? I guess so. Hey! Hey, babe. Just ran into Heather here. Literally. Clumsy me. I bumped into him so hard his phone had a close encounter with the pavement. Crisis averted. Got it. Hm. Well, I'll leave you two alone. See you in class, Nicole. See you. Hm. So, you two have journalism together? Mm. I take it you're not a fan. Not at all. Me neither. Come here. Yeah, I'm excited for this too. I think we're gonna do big things. So we can expect a few wins in the near future? So, any closing remarks? Yeah, we have a great team. Uh, the coaches are really cool. So I think we're gonna do some special things this year. So, you're seeing some wins in our future? -Absolutely. -Great. Well, I'm super excited to watch the team. -Oh, thank you. -What's going on? Hey. Heather was interviewing me for an article. I thought you knew, Nicole. No, I didn't. Well, you know me, far behind. Your mother and her deadlines. Like a real editor. She is a real editor. Oh, I know, but before she came here. She was telling me all about it when she gave me the extension for the article. She gave you an extension? Mm-hm. Well, thank you so much. I will send you a first draft when I finish. Thanks. I like that sweater. Looks good. -What's going on? -I want you to stay away from her. What? Liam, this isn't just, like, some girl flirting with you, okay? It's different. I think that she's dangerous. Come on. I mean, a little weird maybe, but dangerous? I think she has something to do with what happened to Isaac. They knew each other? Online through flashback. So they met on some stupid social media site. It doesn't matter. Hell, I'm friends with her. I know you are. How would you know? Because I created her. You what? Not her. I created a fake profile using a picture of a random girl, her, and now she's here and she's real. Why would you do that? Because I wanted to make sure you wouldn't do anything with her. When she was dming you, it wasn't her, it was me. And I'm sorry, Liam, but it doesn't change the fact -that I think that she's... -Nicole... I think we need some time apart. What? Mom? You're up? Just thought I would dust off the old photo albums. The doctor said you should be resting. Oh, please. What does he know? My old dance pictures. You were such a wonderful dancer. So beautiful. Graceful, elegant. I had such high hopes for you. Mom, you still should. I promise I'm not gonna let you down. What... Why did you send this to me? Are you trying to get under my skin? I didn't send that. You're lying. Everything you've said since you walked through the doors of this school has been a lie. I have no idea what you're talking about. And what you're doing with Liam. Interviewing him, talking to him. It needs to stop. I think you're reading way too much into this. Stay away from me and Liam. I think Liam can make his own decisions. -I said stay away. -Are you really this upset because I interviewed Liam, or are you upset because Liam didn't tell you about it? Maybe you can't trust him as much as you thought. What's going on, ladies? Just a misunderstanding, Ms. Ramos. Oh, there's no misunderstanding. Heather is a psychopath. Nicole! She's trying to ruin my life, -my relationship. -Relationship? Please. Didn't you and Liam break up yesterday? I think you need to calm down, Nicole. I think you need to stop taking her side. I'm not taking anyone's side. Oh yeah? Then why did you give her the extension -and not me? -Is that what this is about? Heather is a new student here. She's adjusting to a new school. I think cutting her some slack would be a good idea. She's manipulating you. Just like she's manipulating everyone else, and the biggest problem is, you can't see it or you don't care. -Just like with dad. -What? -Brooke, hi. -We need to talk. My journal? Do you need some help, Nicole? You. You did this. I mean, hey, at least it didn't get lost, right? Everything okay, ladies? Nicole? Fine. Everything's great. -Almost done? -Just finished. Ah! Fifteen minutes before the deadline for printers. Now you're a real journalist. You wanna talk about earlier? Not really. You wanna talk about Liam? Definitely not. You know, I am sorry that I gave her an extension and not you. But it's only 'cause I know that you can handle it. You can do anything! Thanks. Come on, let's go home. No way. -Have you seen this? -Are you serious? -That's her mom? -That's her mom. -Oh my god, Mrs. Ramos. -That's Lockhart. -I cannot believe this. -Oh, it's her. This is crazy. Oh my god. Oh, that's her. -How could you? -I didn't do it. Just go home. I know it was you. Prove it. It was Heather. Please believe me. Five, six, seven, eight. Go, big blue! Go, go, big blue! Go, big blue! Go, go, big blue! Go, big blue! Go, go, big blue! Go, big blue! -Yeah! -Go, go, big blue! -Smile, smile! -Go, big blue! Go, go, big blue! Whoo! All right, let's grab a drink, yeah? -Yeah. -Thanks. -Good job out there. -Thanks. -Some people are so annoying. -Who is that? It doesn't matter. Okay, ladies, let's get back in line. We're gonna start with dribble. Five, six, five, six, seven, eight. Dribble, dribble, dribble. Shoot, shoot! Get that ball in the hoop, hoop! Dribble, dribble, dribble. Shoot, shoot! Get that ball in the hoop, hoop! Dribble, dribble, dribble. Shoot, shoot! Get that ball in the hoop, hoop! Dribble, dribble, dribble. Shoot, shoot! Get that ball in the hoop, hoop! Oh my god. -No, don't touch her! -I'll call 911. Okay, it's okay; Breathe, it's okay. Mom. I swear it wasn't me. Sit down. What's going on? It's Angie. Is she going to be okay? I hope so. Interviewing. One of the hardest things that a journalist can do. So make sure whenever you're doing your interviews, you have your notebook, you have your recorder, -and always... -Excuse me, Ms. Ramos, I'm so sorry. I'm gonna need to borrow Nicole for a second. Nicole, can I speak to you for a minute? -Make sure you're... -Nicole, you know your locker is school property, right? -Okay. -And I can open it if deemed necessary. Great. I mean, can you tell me what's going on? We received a tip that you've been selling pills. From who? What matters is we take these accusations very seriously. Now, I'm gonna ask you one more time. Is there anything in here you need to tell me about? No. You sure? -Uh... -I'll just...I'll show you. Yeah, yeah. See? -May I? -Be my guest, there's nothing in there. What are these? Those aren't mine! Nicole... Come with me. Let's go. And why is it you think Heather had something to do with this? She's had it out for me from the minute she got here. She's crazy. And she's the one who gave you the tip about the drugs in my locker, isn't she? Heather Harris transferred in here with a student file as clean as can be. And those pills in your locker are the same drugs that put a student in the hospital the other day. What do you expect me to believe? Nicole, I'm sorry. I just don't see how you could think she had anything to do with this. Because Angie isn't like that, she would never do drugs. -How do you know that? -Because she's my best friend! Is she? We've grown apart a bit, but... My mom told you that? Nicole, is there something that you wanna tell me? -Those pills aren't mine. -Are you slipping back into old habits? What? No! We've worked so hard to get to where we are today. "We"? -You know what I mean. -Madelyn. Please. Give us a minute, Nicole. I never thought that she would do something like this. -I raised her better. -I know. I promise we're gonna figure this out. Until we do, we have to stay composed, for Nicole. Let me ask you. Do you have any idea what's going on between Nicole and Heather Harris? They're fighting over Liam. Liam? That's what this is about? This is a love triangle? She won't talk to me about Liam, and she's had issues with Heather ever since she got here. Maybe she is falling back into some old habits. She went through this phase when her father and I broke up. She was drinking and lying, but never pills! Do you believe her? That they're not hers? I don't know. Okay. We need to finish our chat. What's the point? You don't believe me anyway. Nicole. -Go, go. -Sorry. I don't wanna talk about it, mom. You're gonna have to talk about it, Nicole. Why? Will anything I say change your mind? Are you drinking again? -No. -You've lied to me before. I know, but I'm not now. Why won't you believe me? Without details, I don't know what to believe! Principal Lockhart already has his mind made up, and you're telling me you would ever take my word over your boyfriend's? Whose side are you on? I think you're making a lot of bad choices right now. Until you tell me, I cannot be on your side. You sure lecture a lot for a woman who's made nothing but bad choices. What is that supposed to mean? Did you trust dad when he was cheating on you? Or were you just so oblivious that you couldn't see what was going on? You trust Heather so much that you gave her an extension, -but you won't trust me now! -Were the pills yours? What do you think? That's what I thought. Nicole! Who are you? Uh...I'm a friend of Heather's. Heather? Your daughter? My daughter's name is Jenny. I need to take my medicine. Jenny's not home right now, maybe you can come back later. What are these? Actually, I would love to ask you some questions, if I could. Me? Yeah, uh, I was hoping you could tell me about why she transferred to a new school. Well, she... She needed a fresh start, make up for the mistakes that she'd made. -Mistakes. -She blamed it all on some Internet social media thing, but... I know my daughter. She wasn't living up to her potential. What do you mean by that? There was a time that her reputation, her image, meant everything. Now it means nothing. What's going on? Jenny, your friend came to visit you. She's not my friend. She said that she was. She's lying, mom. I have no idea who this is. She broke into our house, she's probably just some junkie trying to steal your pills. Mom, could you call the police? Oh, such a bad move! -Please don't hurt me. -Oh...I won't. Somebody help me, please! -What are you doing? -Please, somebody, help! I didn't hit her; She's lying. But breaking into her house was okay? What were you doing there, anyway? She has something to do with what happened to Angie and Isaac. And she planted those drugs in my locker, I just can't prove it yet. Why would she do all of this? Something from before she transferred. She has a problem with me because of flashback. -Flashback? -She wants revenge. I mean, she came for Angie, and now she's coming for me -and Liam. -Is that what this is about? -Jealousy? -No, not at all! You're saying that Heather caused Angie to overdose and that she put drugs in your locker because she wants to steal Liam away from you? Nicole, you're smarter than this! You're throwing away your whole life because you can't control your emotions. You're grounded until graduation. -What? -Nothing but school and homework. No Liam. No questions. Well, you don't have to worry about that. Get inside. Are you okay? Heather? Her name isn't Heather. But if Jenny wanted you gone like Angie, why didn't she just do it? Because she needs me. Why? To keep covering her tracks. You're helping her? I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I never knew she would take it this far. And then, Angie just kept using the profile. It wasn't right. Somebody had to tell her. The real her. So I did. -How did you find her? -Reverse image search. Simple. No, but I tried that and there was nothing. Thanks to me. When I found her, she asked me to wipe her social media clean. But I didn't know what her true plan was. And I never knew she would hurt Isaac like that. And when she did, I was too scared to come forward. Thought I might be held responsible too. But how has no one caught on to her yet? You can't just waltz into a new school without any credentials. That's where I came in. I hacked the school system and registered her with the Heather Harris identity. I got you and Angie locked out of Heather's profile so she could use it. She wouldn't have been able to do any of this without my help. I'm so sorry, Nicole. Don't be...It's my fault. She wants to tear your life apart. She already has. There's still one thing left that she wants. Hello? I figured I might find you here. What? I wanted to talk to you. Why don't you just schedule another interview? It couldn't wait. It's about Nicole. Listen. I know that you and Nicole don't see eye to eye on things, but right now, we're having some problems. So if you don't mind, I really need to practice. I know you're always gonna take your girlfriend's word over mine, but I wanted to let you know that what happened had nothing to do with me, and I just really didn't want it to affect us. "Us"? I don't like having enemies, and I feel like I've had a target on my back since I walked in the doors of this school. And at the end of the day, I think that you and I could be really good friends. And I don't wanna lose that because of Nicole's insecurities. She says you wrote that article. I give you my word, I didn't, and my word is good for something. At least someone's is. Do you want to know a secret? Okay. I have always wanted to learn how to shoot a basketball. -Anyone can shoot a basketball. -No, I mean, like, shoot it so it makes the cool "swish" sound. Well, that cool "swish" sound is tough to get. Well...maybe you could teach me. I managed to copy the data from her original profile, including Troy green, in a relationship with Jenny Morris. Can you click on the profile? Yeah, and that's where it gets scary. He's missing. Since three days before she came here. Okay, like this. No, okay, all right, so, put your fingertips on the seams right there, okay, and you're gonna put your hands up. When you shoot, your hand is gonna flick, which I like to call "hand in the cookie jar." -Mm-hm. -You get it? Okay. So put your hands up, all right, and on three, -you're gonna shoot it, okay? -Uh-huh. One, two, three. -Three-pointer? -Almost. May I? -Yeah, of course. -Okay. Okay, grab the ball, all right, same thing as before. Okay, now bring it up, okay? Perfect. Now, bend your knees just a little. Okay, on three. One, two, three. Well, look at us. Nice! Good job, coach. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Uh, do you wanna do another shot? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. All right, I'll get the ball. -Okay. -Cool. She's after Liam, they're in the gym. Guess you picked the wrong girl to mess with, huh? Hey, uh, do you wanna give me a ride home? Uh...I don't think that's a good idea. Uh, it's just a ride. I'm in a really weird state of mind with Nicole, and... I don't really feel good about what just happened, so I... I don't think it would be a good idea if you and I... Hook up. Yeah. Do you still love her? I do. It was just a peck, Liam, it's not that big a deal. Okay. Cool. Uh, yeah, I'll give you a ride home. You a little flustered? No. Why? Your bag. Aggh, that rarely happens on a basketball court. Mm. Phew. Looks like they left. We...we need to find her now. We should call the police. Tell them Liam's in trouble. I'm not exactly on their good side right now. But Heather's mother? Why would she help us? Maybe she won't. But she's our only link to the real Heather. We think your daughter's gonna hurt someone. Why would she hurt someone? I did something really bad to your daughter and it was wrong of me, but I think she's gonna do the same thing to him that she did to Troy. Troy went missing. She didn't hurt Troy. I'm not so sure that that's true. I found it in her room, along with that. Your boyfriend? Yeah. And who's Heather? It's a long story, but do you know where your daughter is right now? She said she was going on a date, I don't know where. Is her cell phone on a family plan? Yes. Can I borrow your phone? What are you doing? -Finding where she is. -Oh, she said that we don't have that feature on our phones. Yeah, your daughter's good at lying. Got her. -Nicole? -Just listen to me, mom. Okay, I was right about Heather, she's crazy. Nicole... I'm sending you a location. I need you to call the police and tell them to meet us there. What do you mean, "meet you"? What...where are you? Please, mom, just trust me. That's her car. Nicole, wait! You stay here and you wait for the police! No! Liam? Liam, wake up. Liam. Nicole! Liam! Liam! Cass! Cass, he...He won't wake up. Liam? Liam, Liam, baby, please wake up! Liam! Liam! How'd you find us? Your mom. She said this was your special spot. It was, back when I had someone special to share it with. You need to stop this. Think about your mother. I am. I'm doing this all for her. She can't bear the thought of having a less-than-perfect daughter with a less-than-perfect image. That's why she had the heart attack, you know? You gave her the heart attack. She wanted so much for me, and I worked so hard to get it, only for you to take it all away. You can't do this. You did this, not me. I made a mistake. A mistake? You set up that profile. You unleashed this virus across campus. First one person, then another. You've ruined me. I'm sorry. You're sorry? Do you know the things people said about me? Do you know the looks I got? I tried to tell everybody that the profile wasn't me, but nobody believed me. Not even Troy. Why would you say those things about me? I'm telling the truth. Troy! He thought I was sleeping around, he thought I was some slut. This was supposed to be our night. Maybe you should have thought about that before you tried to sleep with half the guys in the school. I told you, that wasn't me! He thought he could dump me at homecoming in front of everyone, knowing that my mother would find out, knowing everyone could see us. Troy, get up! Troy, wake up! He humiliated me. That's why you killed him? I didn't kill him! It was an accident, and then I saw his body lying there and I knew that nobody would believe me. This isn't an accident. I did something wrong, but nothing like this. I didn't kill anyone. Oh, sure you did. -You killed Jenny. -No, I didn't. You can still stop this, you can still stop everything. I've come too far to stop now. Plus, it's kinda been fun ruining your life. It's too late. It's your word against mine, and nobody believes anything you say anymore. Maybe they will now. I wouldn't want to misquote you. No. Jenny, stop this! My name is Heather. No! Run, Nicole! Get off of me! Well, I guess I better get rid of you before you try and ruin anybody else's life. Stay away from my daughter! Nicole, my god! Honey, I'm so sorry! I should have listened to you. -Liam, are you all right? -Oh my gosh, are you okay? -Say something... -Liam! Liam! You were right. That Heather girl was bad news. -Okay. -Okay, okay. -Oh, we did it! -Oh, how's the arm? Nothing, compared to the headache from those pills that she snuck me. Aww, it's just hangover training for college. You ever think we'd wind up here? Of course. And I knew we'd be together. The arm? Please. Thank you. The three musketeers. Right? Right. You guys are such goobers. Whoo! C'mere. Oh my god, we graduated. Yes, finally. Should we take a picture? -Yes. -All right, you three. -Last time. -Last time? -Yeah. -Let's do it. Here we go, selfie, test my skills. -Okay. -Let's do it. One, two, three! Whoo! You still not gonna talk to me? You really messed up this time, Jenny. My name is Heather. Excuse me. I said, my name is Heather. I keep telling you again and again. It's Heather! It's Heather! Now, call me Heather! -It's Heather, call me Heather! -Guard! Guard! Heather! Call me Heather! -Guard! -It's Heather now! -Guard! -Heather! Heather! Where's my phone?
