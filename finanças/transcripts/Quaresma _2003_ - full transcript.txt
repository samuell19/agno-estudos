A film by Asleep with the window open in this cold! It's still early if you want to sleep longer. Have you anything to iron? Let me see the shirt you brought. A lot of people are here already. Anything to eat before you go down? Soup... Pumpkin jam? You used to love jam! I haven't seen you since your father died. He's greatly missed, in this house. Don't feel you have to stay and talk. We'll handle it. David! Did you get any sleep? You're so like your father... And taller than me, you rascal! Pedro, couldn't you find anything flashier to wear? Jos? Rosa, how are you? Your father's right. How are you? How about you? We've got lots to talk about. I'll go inside but be right back. Remember my brother-in-law's son? David, this is Jos? Rosa, our mayor. I knew you when you were... Give me a hug. Your father was a good friend of mine. Has Jos? Guilherme arrived? I haven't seen him all day. He was supposed to pick Ana up. You're...? David. Joao Afonso's son. Dr. Bernardino's grandson. You haven't changed. I remember you, up at the hotel. Your father spent weeks at the hotel because of the snow, ski-ing. My poor little cousin! I thought you'd never get here! Hello. So many aunts, godmothers, and condolences... Stuck with all those witches. I'm pouring. This is a special day... Let's drink... - To grandfather! - Who left us reasonably comfortable! How can you drink that plonk? It'll kill you! Let's go to the windmill? To the windmill! You're hopeless, Pipa! You're old enough to know better! Good morning. Haven't you been to bed yet, David? When my father was alive, he sent ten boxes of oranges a year to Salazar. In thanks, every time a minister came here Salazar sent him to visit the factory. When my grandfather was put in jail what did he send Salazar then? He went to Lisbon personally and brought him home. Your grandfather was very like our father. It wasn't quite like that. My grandfather never sent presents to Salazar. He didn't need to, he'd already inherited money. My father used to say that to be a prince, you have to be prepared to go to hell in the end. Men are so vain! - David, have you eaten yet? - No. - Would you like to eat with us? - They're to cut down the orange grove to build houses! It's sad, isn't it? I didn't know you were back. Why would they talk about me? So, you're back? For the time being. - Did you get bored... - Cities are boring, especially small cities. - Partridges? - Yes, a special recipe, my mother's. Shot by me, of course! Imagine you, father of a family! - I almost got married. - And? And I didn't... - Do you still enjoy going shooting? - I was never very good. Yes, you were... You had a good teacher. Just a second... Why don't you come and live here? When do you get back from Denmark...? There'|| be no one to run the property. It was your father's. Dona Maria gave it to me when he died. It's yours. I kept it for you. How's your mother? She sent you her love. I thought she might. How is she? What's she doing now? Nothing. She has young children. She's quite comfortably off. She doesn't keep in touch. Are you definitely going to Norway? Denmark! - Yes, next week. - Then what? Who knows! You should settle here. And do what? When we were small it was paradise. Then your father died. I've never liked coming back since. - Good morning, sir. - I'm here. What time is it? Time they got back from the cemetery. Ask for breakfast. Or if you'd rather, wait for lunch. It won't be long. I didn't go to the funeral either. Your grandfather wouldn't have you got up to go to his funeral. It's better to sleep than pray. You dream and rest at the same time. Didn't you know that? Pedro hasn't even honored us with his presence. He wasn't feeling well yesterday. He had to rest... - As usual... - He's better, today. It's roast kid on Saturdays. Who's taking me to Castelo Branco? Serve David. It's always been like this, fish on Friday, meat on Saturday. Have you seen the time? That's it! I'm not going! - Then don't go! Is she going alone? - She stays home! She wants to go today. You sort it... From here on, I'm doing nothing for the family! When are you leaving? You and L?cia? Wednesday... Two weeks Wednesday. L?cia went to get the tickets today. L?cia... is organized to the last detail. Is L?cia going to deal with everything? No, I want to go back to Lisbon today. Are you going to Lisbon by any chance? I wouldn't mind going, but I can't this week. Not this, nor the next. We're finishing the collection, the factory works Saturdays. No way... I can't, no way... Because I'm out, Gui has his hands full. That's a pity, because I like his hands. Let me see yours? There's a train this afternoon. Julieta knows the times. Julieta, what time is the train? To Lisbon? Three o'clock, it's always late. - What? No sauce for me? - No, of course not! Why didn't you bring the beans? Off you go... I thought she was better? I thought you said she was better? And she is. Hands are the key to people. You can't get in without hands. Your hand is the key to your house. Some open everything. Like thieves' magic wands. Skeleton keys? With a hand like this, nobody can resist you. I have one like that, so they put me in a clinic. But, not you. You only open to yourself. That's not bad. It's not bad, perhaps too little. What are you doing? I'm robbing the dead. There you are! We need this one. How did you know about this? The maids' old room? Your grandfather showed me. Lie down. Lie down. Afraid I'm going to rape you? Don't look, think. Think about what? Do I have to tell you? - Are you coming? - Go on. - Telephone! - Don't forget... this place doesn't exist. David, telephone! It hasn't stopped ringing! - Did you go to the embassy? - To the consulate. We're registered. It was quick because of Filipa. Everybody's been asking after her. And you, of course. When are you coming back? I don't think I'll be back today. Aunt Maria has asked me to stay. Come tomorrow. Do you mind? No, I don't mind. Is that Filipa? Yes, I've got to go. Kiss. - Tell her I'll be back tomorrow. - Right. Why did you lie to her? Did I lie? Didn't you say you were leaving? Are you staying because of me? Are you crazy? Completely... Have you been in the attic again? Not again! This is too much. Jos? Guilherme left the car. You're to go home. Keys! Go with her. Gui has no idea what she's about! She's not that crazy! Come on, let's go! The spirits here are my friends. Not only when I'm here, but always! They sleep and laugh with me and are silent when I sleep... I'll sit on the steps... and we can bore each other to death. Sometimes I'm ready to go, to leave everything here. - Then I feel sorry for them. - Let's go. I think some monks were buried here. Priors of the monastery. My grandfather said Knights Templar. Have you been here before? Yes, I have. We spent a night in a tent. Gui made us knights in the abbey. Maria Antonia and I. Don't do that, Ana! The water's freezing! Pedro, don't go into the woods without asking Jos? Guilherme! There were guards there yesterday. The woods belong to everyone in the family. - And to nobody. - They all inherited the property. I'll speak to Gui if necessary. I'm not afraid of Z? Guilherme's guards! It'll get worse if they do nothing, Mother. Guil will cut all the trees down... I'll go into the woods whenever I like. Do everything according to the book. Be careful, they're armed! Pipa! Aren't there armed guards in the woods? They're armed, aren't they Pipa! I can only take you home when the factory closes. I'll wait for you. I've missed my train anyway... Did you take Ana home? Yes, like you said. - Only now? - Yes. We went for a stroll in town. We've got the building permit. Will the natural park only stretch as far as Boidobra now? Don't joke about serious matters, there's money at stake, a lot of money! Right. I'll have my men and machines ready tomorrow. If I need you, I'll ring you. Certainly, sir. Goodbye. - Why did you put Ana in a clinic? - It's over, she's out. But she really felt safe there. Safe from what? Things that frighten her, perhaps. She shouldn't be shut up. - Who should be? - Certainly not her. You don't know, you can't judge... If you really want to know, she'll never go back again. She'll never be shut up again. Stay with us tomorrow, so she can get to know you better. I've got a free day, we can go to the mountains. Lunch with her father at the hotel, then go to grandfather's house. How long is it since you have been to grandfather's? I have to get back to Lisbon. You'll never get back before lunch, it's a wasted day. Stay with us, leave in the afternoon. You'll be in Lisbon for dinner. What do you think? We'll leave about half eleven. Come on. Ana will be pleased. She likes to play with people. Five thousand years ago, Europe was covered by forest. A forest of oak trees, that stretched from here to Russia. Poor endangered oaks, like us their namesakes the Carvalhos. Burnt by fire! Only eating mushrooms. And blackberries, now and then, and chestnuts on Sundays. Did you come here when you were little? Why don't I remember you? You lived with your mother then. Don't worry, you're very lovely. Isn't she, David, Very lovely? Don't answer, David! I forbid you to answer! Don't do that Gui, please! The house has changed. It's the color. The house is the same. Here we are. Ana, stop that! We're at your father's. Hello, father. So, you're going to? To Denmark. Eolic energy. To study the wind. There's no lack of wind here. Are you all going? - How long have you been married? - About two years. - How old is your daughter? - Eighteen months... A year and a half. Don't do that! The trout are superb! It's the room that's different. I'm sorry I woke up when I shouldn't. It's all right. It doesn't matter. Ana woke you on purpose. It's months since she touched me. We're going to stay here today! I'd like to know what Ana told you upstairs. Look, I'm not asking... No, of course not! She hasn't said anything. Just that we're staying tonight. You see. She doesn't want to stay with me. What do you mean? I should go to Lisbon. I'll call L?cia and explain. No, don't call Lucia! - How will we get back? - I'll pick you up tomorrow. There, now you hate me. Why would you spend the night here? Was this Gui's idea? L?cia, it's me. Jos? Guilherme has just rung. What did he say? I'm leaving tomorrow. Yes, he said you're leaving tomorrow. - How is she? - Who'? Aunt Maria, who else? Didn't you say she was very upset... I can't hear. It's the television... - Where are you? - Outside a caf?. Don't you want to hear about Filipa? Tell me... She had a temper tantrum, she wanted her blue coat. - I had to unpack... - Tell me about it tomorrow. The cross-eyed boy Did you explain... Cut scythe, cut Born for white bread Leaving for another world Should tread carefully... There's a song I like... Yellow parrot With a golden beak... Say it again! Yellow parrot With a golden beak Carry this letter To my love... Do you know it? Carry this letter To my love Now I have my lover Nothing else matters I only brush my hair When I go to the fields To go to the fields There and back I pass the door Of my loved one Now I have my lover Nothing else matters I only brush my hair When I go to the fields Neither married man Nor bachelor Just a young man To please me Now I have my lover Nothing else matters I only brush my hair When I go to the fields I only want what belongs to me! You're two-faced! And me singing for her! You can't do it. I'm stupid! What are you talking about? You only give when asked, you only go where invited... You're too proper. You just do things, you never risk anything.. You obey... What do you know about me? You're the one afraid of not knowing. Anybody who loves me has to know what I want. He can't wait for orders. Anybody can obey! Who told you that I love you? If it were serious, we'd be dead. It's always serious. Wake up! What's this? Ana, let's go! What are you doing here? I came for breakfast. Want some? David, let's go! Let's go! - Is that an order? - Yes, it is. David! No, David stays. Pi can't drive alone in that state. Filomeno! Help! The train for Lisbon is about to leave from Platform One. Thank you. That's all right. Where's your luggage? Is that all? Haven't you got a coat or anything? It was on the other plane. Where's my beautiful darling Filipa? Have you eaten? Look who's here! Off you go Did you have a good journey? She lost her luggage in Copenhagen. We've got to get her a coat. She can borrow one of mine... Let's give Filipa her bath... David, do you mind? We seldom use this room. We never have guests. We don't really know anyone. It's quiet you'll feel at home. Thank you. May I draw the curtains back? Can you manage that? Stop thanking us. May I open the window? Is she going to stay in all day? Neither of us have time. What are we going to do? I never thought it would be like this! Coming to a place she doesn't know people she doesn't know, no reaction. I'm having a key made for her. The problem can't be solved by a key. Her alone in the house looking after Filipa... It's all right. Give her time. Pi's death... - Pi died a year ago! - Six months. Filipa can go to the creche, this week, then we'll see. Everything will be all right. Aren't you asleep? I can't sleep. There's no wind. You're so cold! You don't have to do that. I'll make some tea. Can't I do anything at all? Don't be silly, come on! Look at me. May I continue? Can I help you? It's good to hear you laugh. I thought you'd never laugh again. I've lost the right. Is there a David Carvalho in this class? Yes. A call for you. The police station? You had to pick her up there? - With Filipa? - Filipa was fine. David, this can't go on! - I don't want my daughter... - What? To be arrested... Arrested? For heaven's sake! They wanted to know why she was crying. Would it have been better if they'd done nothing? Was she crying? You told me she was fine. Ana, bring Filipa in! Don't speak to her as if she were a maid! She's behaves like a maid! - Nobody asks her to what she does! - But it suits you. Telephone! - Would you mind answering? - It won't be for me. Just a moment please. I'll go and see. Let's eat, You can't stay like this all day. It's for Ana. Don't you want to take it? You can take it in our room. Who was it? I don't know, someone Danish. A man? Yes, a man. What the devil... You're home early. I'll take my daughter. Hello. Would you like a cup of tea? Take Filipa. It's all right. What's going on? Who is that man? - He lives in that house. - Nobody lives in that house. He does live there. This time you're going to talk to me. In the garden? - How long have you known him? - Who? The man who lives in that house... Since the first day. You left me. I was alone. And? I went for a walk in the garden. And? And nothing. He was there, he invited me to have a cup of tea. - You don't even speak the language! - There was no need. Did you kiss him in front of Filipa! You kiss L?cia in front of Filipa. Can I go in now? You should have called him when she didn't speak for a week... Do you want me to call Gui every time she does something silly, gets hurt. Kissing some man isn't just something silly... It could be seriously silly. You're being ridiculous... I'm not being ridiculous, I'm jealous... You're right, I'm being ridiculous. It's absurd to be jealous now. Gui? It's David. Sorry to ring so late, things are getting complicated here. It's me. I don't know what he is going to say, but it's all true... As you wish. Sorry. Do you know what time it is? It's almost nine o'clock. Almost ten... in the evening. It's the opposite in winter. I've been expecting you. Would you like a cup of tea? It's late. There's a lot of wind, like here. And the wind is pleasant. It's the mountain, the mountain and the wind. We'd like we chat a little longer... Would you mind coming back later. I didn't mean to interrupt... Forever. No matter what. Forget it, just forget it. Translation: Margaret Kelting
