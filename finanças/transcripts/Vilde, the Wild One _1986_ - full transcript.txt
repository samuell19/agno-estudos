A trading post outside Bergen, 1885 Hello, everybody! Be careful here. - Come on. - How nice. How strong you are. Hello, everybody. What a wonderful day this will be. Welcome. - Hello! - Vilde. Hello, hello, Sjur. Heartily welcome. Vilde! Careful up the stairs here, boys. Don't tip me so far backwards. I'm serious! You're killing an old woman. All right. This looks cosy. Hello, folks, this is going great. I'm going to sit over on that side. So, dear friends... This garden was constructed for me by my husband when I was young. A love garden! Sjur, we are all very happy that we could gather here tonight. To celebrate your great success in South America. You have done well, and earned big money. We have to organize a wedding quite soon. Yes. Look at Vilde. She looks like a princess, Sjur. The Lord moves in mysterious ways. For a few dizzying moments, it seemed like the hand of the Lord had been removed from this trading post. But God does not let one single lamb be driven from the flock, and disappear into the abyss. Unless the Lord has tried the contents of its heart. I take it as a sign that today He has sent one of his sons across the vast ocean. To our trading post. In this manner, he sets everything right. We praise you, Lord Jesus. And we thank you, in our meekness. Amen. Are you excited? Oh, look! - This is for you. - Look at that! It's for you. She is just shy. Maybe we should drink a toast to our trading post. And to the great event which is taking place today. - A toast to Sjur. - Cheers. Vilde is a bit shy now, with so many people around. - Cheers! - Yes, cheers. Open it. You must look after Vilde, Sigurd. Daddy... Now Sigurd is your father. Look at the mountain, Daddy. The golden mountain. Yes. Carry me outside. Is that you singing, Vilde? Do you know what my painting is called? It's called The Golden Mountain. And it's yours. Vilde? Come to Daddy. Come. What are you doing with a man like Sjur? My father arranged it. He wants you on his boat as well. He deserves neither you nor the figurehead. Vilde. Come. Wait a minute. We can't go yet. The light is just right. This is marvelous. - But we're supposed to be off. - I must sketch it. What's she doing with that picture? Sjur sent you this. Aren't you going to try it on? Aren't you ashamed of having the painting hanging there? How did you pay for it? Tell me. How did you pay for it? Make sure that you break off that connection. I have the means to force you. Put on the wedding dress. Please come in. So... Wait! Wait for me! Come on, don't be silly! Wait! Don't be silly. Let me get on. There you go. The chamber pot! No, not you. Go away! - She is not deaf. - No, just mute. Probably the wood nymph cut her tongue out of her mouth. So she wouldn't come up with idle talk. Just you wait! Nemesis is coming! The way you treat your mother! This cannot be. Change the bedclothes, and clean up! And don't use water as cold as the last time. The party was so boring. What a horrible time we're living in. Oh, I'm so glad the priest is here. What a blessing. It is terrible for an old, paralyzed lady to have to live with this devil woman, who won't give me neither drink nor food. The priest should rather come with me. Oh no, please don't go. I suffer from not being allowed to go to church. To kneel to our Lord in Heaven. You have a daughter out of wedlock. You bring misfortune over both your father and over his reputation. The girl shall be given away to a Christian woman. The child is unbaptized. And nobody knows who is her father. So let us fold our hands and pray. Our Father in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen. Amen. Do you believe in the Lord, God the Father? Yes. Then why do you not pray? I cannot hear you. - I don't know. - You don't know? Satan has taken up his abode in you. But I shall save you. I shall drive Satan out of your body. The Lord bless thee, and keep thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and be gracious unto thee. Stand up, in the sight of God. That your daughter is mute, is no wonder. Because God... God...! Punishes you this way. You have not been initiated in the church after the birth of your child! And you are excluded by us all! Deeds of the dark... Dark deeds... I can't take it anymore. Malene! Malene! Vilde. Come to Daddy. Vilde Kiss it. All girls love their daddy. Don't cry, Malene. I won't let anyone hurt you. I told you I had the means to force you. You satanic... From now on, you'll do as I say. What's that mountain called? The Golden Mountain. The Golden Mountain. Vilde... Vilde. Vilde. Vilde... - Vilde. - No... It's your own fault. You're the one making me do it. You miss whoring with your father. That's what you do. Yes? You were born for it. The love of Christ forces us. The love of Christ forces us to believe. The love of Christ forces us to love. The love of Christ is everything. It forces us with voluntary joy. The love of Christ which forces us, also gives us strength. What for duty and fear weighs heavy, for love is effortless. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom... Bloody hell! What if someone sees you? Has Sjur arrived? No. Tell me. It is my father. Does he know anything? I cannot talk here. You must tell me what he said. Nobody can hear you. Tell me everything. Not this. You must be honest with me, wild one. You know I have to leave. Take me with you. I haven't had time to tell her yet. You promised. I did. I will. Edward. People are wondering where you are. Vilde just came to say goodbye. Oh, that's right. You were his model. I hope he paid you properly. Look... You'd better have this. Give her the money. The house will need to be cleaned before it's closed. She can do it. She's not a maid. One never knows what your models are. They all look the same to me. Ah... So you're in here. I've been looking everywhere. Those Norwegians downstairs are so boring. We haven't met, have we? Vilde. How are you doing? Is this you? Let's have a look, shall we? Excellent. You're a very handsome woman. Will you model for me? Hm? Listen, I must paint you. Have a drink. Why not? Sjur. The wedding will be arranged as planned. Don't worry. What are you doing here now? How long will you continue with your damn stubbornness? Don't you understand what this is all about? Is he the one who puts ideas into your head? That bloody painter. I will never marry Sjur. Don't you understand that you're indebted to him? Just like we all are? He has done a lot for us through these years. - Vilde... - I don't owe you anything. Vilde... Vilde... It has to be this way. Vilde... Vilde... Tell me, what are you up to now? Did you vex your father again? It seems like you're planning to ruin our lives completely. Your actions make no sense at all. You have to comply a bit. You're really something. Vexing your father all day and all night. With no consideration that we have to make a living somehow. No, you only care about yourself. You fiend. Oh, I'm so sweaty. Wipe properly, further down. Between the breasts as well. Oh my God. You deserve a real beating! That's no way to treat your parents. We have fed you all your life, and given you everything. Come on, wash me! My God, I'm so sweaty. Get my clothes off. I need some air. Come on, now. God, this is terrible. Take off my shoes. Don't grab my ankle! Carry me properly. Open it. You imbeciles! Careful with me. You're breaking my arms and legs. Oh! My God, don't kill me. I'm being murdered in my own bed. Vilde... Try to understand me. Don't leave me. My little girl. Don't leave me. Why are you giving me cold coffee? Vilde... I won't let you leave me! Malene! What the hell do you mean by this? I'm not going home to get married. Vilde. You're making me furious. You must understand that you cannot act like this. Eh? Malene. You cannot continue treating us this way. Everyone is taking us for fools back home. Both us and Sjur. You have to come home now. What do you mean? You have to get rid of it. I would have kept it if I knew it was his. You could have left me alone. What's happening here? Sigurd? Can't you handle her? Toss the kid into the sea. I'll deal with Sjur. Come on, bring the girl with you. Malene! Malene! Malene! Malene... Malene, beware. You were born for this. No! Don't touch her. I don't know what to do. God, give me hope. I see. She managed to drag herself home. Yes, she is a bit "I. What's the matter? Right... And whose kid are you? You and I will be the best of friends. Don't be afraid. Are you scared of me? Would you like to taste my cigar? Oh well. You shouldn't be afraid of me. You can have anything you want. A dog, maybe? A horse? My God... It's all just a mess. I wanted us to be happy together. That's why I came home. Your mother, you and I. I have labored all around the world to get back to you. My God. And then you've been whoring around, having two kids. You are greatly indebted to me. Your father owes me a lot of money. Are you aware that I could have you incarcerated? Do you know that? So you'd better make up your mind. This is the last time. Either we get married now, or it's the house of correction. You ungrateful beast of a woman. Whoring around like that, and having kids. Bastards! I don't trust you, Sigurd. I want a full overview of all documents and accounts by Friday! Yes, of course. Don't you try to hide anything from me. Forward now. What are you doing, Sjur?! Malene, I'm coming. Hold on! - Let go of the rope. - No! - Stay away from me! - You're not taking that boat. She's going to town. Understand? She's big enough to take care of herself. Move! - No... Malene... - Put that thing away. Leave my child alone. I said, go away! - Get away from there. - Malene! Let go of me! Let go! She's going to town, and that's where she'll stay! Bring my child back here! Come back! Malene! Come back! Malene! Malene! She will stand here as a laughing stock. Malene, I'm coming! Malene! Indian fruits are being sewed now. This is one of our happiest moments ever. Isn't that right, Borghild? This is one of our happiest moments. This is the only real feat you have done in your entire life. It's not much worth. You have made your fortune yourself. - Travelled around, and fought for it. - Yes, I have. Where did Sigurd come from? He was on a Swedish collier, and came drifting ashore, dirty and filthy. So I scrubbed him and fixed him up. Congratulations! Make space here! Dear friends! Could we have some silence here? Dear friends. On this occasion, I would like to say a few words. This is a great day for me and my wife. A day I have been looking forward to for many, many years. The love of my life, whom I have longed for, and who is finally mine. She is the reason we are seated here today. Thank you. And cheers, everybody. There you see. A man is a man, and a word is a word. Come ashore now. You're looking good. Look, here is a nice present for you. You have behaved well. Here you are. What in Christ's name are you doing, girl? Put on your shoe, put on your glove. Now the child will homewards row. Home to Daddy and Mummy. Sjur is waiting for you. You cannot let him wait any longer. Vilde? So you're up here, are you? Is this where you like to be taken? Up here? Just calm down, because now I'm in my full right. - Just stay calm. - Stop it! Let go of me! You've been here before, haven't you? I know you really like it. - Tell me that you like it. - Go away! You pig! Come on. - You have no say in this. - What do you think the guests...? - Get off me. - Just scream. Nobody cares. After all, it's our wedding day! - I hate you! - You hate me? I'm in my full right. Get your dress off. Come here. Come on. I'm hot. Sat... Everything I do... And everything I have done... I do for you, Malene. Malene... Say "Mummy". "Mummy." Tell me that you love me. Malene... Come out. Malene. Help me, Gry. You're out of your mind, Vilde. People will know he didn't drown on his own. Why do you always think the worst of me? Please help me. I won't tell on you. There's no reason to grieve anymore. Our economy is secured for all future time. - Hey... - Get away from me. The darkness is only temporary. On Judgment Day, everything shall be revealed. And each and every one shall receive his allotted share. It's your own fault. You're the one making me do it. - Come here. - Let go of me! No! Let go! Let me go! Malene! - Let me go! - Come on! No! Mummy... Mummy... TO OUR CHILDREN
