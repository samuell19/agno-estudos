Excuse me. Hi. I couldn't help but noticing I think this would look really pretty with your outfits? Wow, beautiful. - Thank you. - Bye, bye. Hi, Jenna. They should add you to the city sights map for tourists. Oh, well, I am just doing my civic duty as a New Yorker. I just wish I had more customers to see your gorgeous work. Maybe I should have just given her the whole dress. She'd probably wear it all around the city. She's a tourist. But you would look stunning in that dress. Where am I going to wear a dress like that? On the subway? Around the corner to the bodega? Hey, they would be taking pictures of the best dressed woman in Manhattan. Well, I am more suited to dressing the best women of Manhattan. There is a leading lady inside you begging to come out. Things will turn around. And that's why you are my employee of the month. I am your only employee. I get all the months. All right, well, since we don't have any more customers, why don't you show us what else you got? - Oh, I got. Come on. - All right. All right. Annacardona, feast your eyes on my latest. Let me know what you like. I don't like any of them. Because I love them all. Are these ready to sell? I may have gotten a tiny bit carried away. I made an entire spring collection in various sizes. These are going to be perfect for wedding season. They are bold choices. Well, what woman doesn't like to be bold? I don't know, but lately it seems that our best seller is a black pantsuit. All it takes is for one person to like it then that person tells another person, that person tells two people. Next thing you know, you got a fashion empire. Okay, let's hope that that's a customer and not a bill collector. Mm-hmm. Good afternoon. May I help you find something? Yeah, I'm going to a wedding. - Yes. - Not a funeral. Thanks. I'm good. Wait, wait. This is our business collection. Our spring collection is in the back. Cutting edge. No one has seen it. Come on, all custom designed. There is no other similar piece out there. Love these. See, Jenna's a fantastic seamstress. She could tailor for a perfect fit. Yeah, and you know what? As a fellow brunette, I think this shade of pink would look absolutely stunning on you. You're right. You know what? I'll take all of them. All of the dresses for one wedding? Not just a wedding. The social event of the season. Very exclusive, week long event. Let's get you fitted. Wow. I can't believe your dad created so many popular apps. Invested. Daddy can barely drive his Tesla, much less code. But now he owns majority stake of most of the socials. Must be very lucrative. Money can't buy status. Not on the East coast, anyway. We are considered new money. It's so elitist. Oh, you guys use crystals, right? I wouldn't be caught dead in plastic beading. Oh, yes. Elitist. Right. Well, you know, East Coasters are pretty traditional. It's all going to change with this wedding. The bride is unconventional, artistic type. Total opposite from the groom's family. Who's getting married? Wyatt Slate. From the Slate Publishing empire? Are you friends with them? I wish. I've never met them in my life. I was invited by the family's PR firm. PR firms plan weddings? It's a brilliant move. And it's breaking me into the New York social scene. Because my father rules social media, they think inviting me will give him extra exposure. Well, you will definitely stand out in these dresses. So, when is the wedding? - I leave tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow tomorrow? - Yes, tomorrow. I'll have a courier stop by to pick them up along with the rest of these bags. It's in the Hamptons. I assume you'll be available if there's a wardrobe malfunction? Of course. Oh, yes, yes. Yes. We're a full service. We'll have them ready. Here's the address for the Slates and the number for my father's accountant. He'll take care of the bills. Thanks, ladies. Oh, time to go, baby. Thanks. Tomorrow? Do you think she will get our dresses on social media? Definitely a good chance. Every website mentions this wedding. The publishing giant clings to a merger with Red Wagon Children's Publishing in spite of the public outcry when Slate Media pulled all its book donations to schools, libraries and children's hospitals earlier this year. Dang, they definitely need an image rehab. This could be our chance to save the store. If people see our dresses on social media, it could blow up. How could somebody this good looking be so heartless? Forget about the Slates. We are going to pull an all nighter. Anybody there? Oof, ow. Anna! Anna, we overslept! We missed the courier. Then deliver them personally. I can't do that. They're New York Royalty. Don't be silly. She said she might need you in case of a wardrobe malfunction. This definitely qualifies. Oh my God, okay. I am off to save the store. May I help you? Lindsay Arnold. I'm here... I had staff waiting for you at the helicopter pad. Does your pilot still need clearance? The helicopter is in the shop, so I drove in. Looks like you got the last car on the rental lot. Now, I sent you a map of the estate and the itinerary. Are you okay to make it on your own or do you need to wait for an escort? I'm sure I can find it myself. Ooh, ah. Ooh. Hi. Excuse me. Hello. Hey. Wow. I've never had my grass aerated by pink heels before. How long do you think it would take you to finish the east garden? Well, I could send you a pair and you could let me know. Oh, great. I'm looking for Lindsay Arnold's room. I seem to have lost the... - The lady at the gate. - Oh, Eileen? Yeah. Trust me, you're better off. Take a seat. Okay. Yeah. Allow me. Oh, you don't have to do... Okay. Here we go. Thanks. I'm just getting a look at my new garden equipment. Huh? Yeah, well, I was going to try them on, but they won't fit. I'm size twelve. Yeah, so your room? Yeah, for Lindsay Arnold. Oh, yeah. The stranger, invited by a PR firm to a family wedding. Yeah. - Come along. - Okay. Wow, this place is huge. I mean, it feels more like a museum than an actual house. I could spend days just snooping around. I'm sure the PR firm has plenty of staged fun to keep people busy. Like the gardens? Oh, is that where the wedding will be? Or the reception? Oh, the PR firm and their circus is not allowed in my garden. Oh, I would love to see the gardens. I'm sure they're beautiful. You are so lucky to work on such a grand estate. Right, well, I mostly work in the office. The gardens have offices as well? Yeah, but that would... I would love to see the Slate private gardens. I bet they are like walking in paradise. Yeah, it is my favorite part of the estate. Come on. Oh. Right. This is your room. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to leave you and get ready for the next event. Your chambermaid should be with you shortly. Goodbye, Miss Arnold. Uh... Okay. Wow. Jenna, did you deliver the dresses? I'm here. Lindsay is not. Well, when I called the accountant today, he said that Lindsay was on her way to Europe, not the Slate wedding. She's been invited to go yachting with royals. So all of this was for nothing? Well, he did agree to pay for the dresses and the sale will keep us open for another month. So it's not for nothing, but we still need a long term solution. Yeah, but she won't be wearing my dresses on social media. Not at the Slate wedding, no. There is a problem. Everyone thinks Lindsay is here. What? Why? I checked in as her at the gate. You told them that you're Lindsay? Everyone, including the gardener, thinks they know Lindsay Arnold because it is me. Surprise. Are you crazy? The lady at the gate was very scary. And now I'm in Lindsay's room and they're sending me a chambermaid. No, you gotta get out before you end up as a Page Six scandal. Okay? Just come back and we'll think of a new plan to save the store. Okay? Yeah, right. I'm out. - I'll see you soon. - Okay. What am I doing? What am I doing? Oh, I apologize for being late. I was waiting at the helipad. I brought out the rest of your bags. Oh, that's so sweet, but I actually have to go. Oh. Nonsense. You cannot attend the reception in that. You look like you had a hard night. I'm sure that we can find something for you to wear in here. Oh, dear. Hmm, this is not the honeymoon. No, that is not mine. That is not mine, but I do really need to go. Here, let me put this away for you. In just a moment, dear. Oh, now this is so much more appropriate. Just the pop of color this crowd needs. Beautiful. There has been a mistake. Oh, no, no. There is absolutely no mistake. My name is Diana, and I am here to assist you all week. Anything you need. A whole week? Okay, so I, uh... Please, miss, I cannot have you be late. This is so awkward. Come, no need. No need. - I'm going to get... - I forgot my toothbrush. Can't go without my toothbrush. Don't you worry, I'm going to get you dressed. Oh. Look at you now, isn't this better? Yes, you are a natural beauty, my dear. Phew. And you look absolutely stunning in this dress. Okay, now, off you go. Time to shine. Come on. - Uh... - Time for makeup and hair. Oh. Nope, Okay. Uh... Oh. Oops. Miss Arnold. Did you lose your way again? Oh, hi. Wow, I guess even the gardeners wear designer in the Hamptons. Good evening, Hunter. Hey. Hey, Diana, you going to let me take you for a spin on the dance floor this week? Like you ever touch a dance floor. Now, please be a gentleman and escort Miss Arnold. Have a good night, Miss Arnold. Mr. Slate. Thank you, Diana. Um, uh, you're, you're, you're, you're Hunter Slate, not the gardener. Oh, you thought I was the gardener. To be fair, you were not in an tuxedo. Aren't you supposed to know all the latest social media? The PR team said you were going to help us rehab our image, that you were desperate to be part of New York society. You don't even know who I am. Yeah, I, I knew this was a bad idea. Well, would you say that you were desperate to appear warm and fuzzy to the public? Because if that's the case, this really isn't a good start. My apologies. So that you won't get lost again. Oh, good. You know, I may have mistaken the bride for a line cook. I'd put a bell on you, but I don't think anyone will take their eyes off you in that stunning dress. Um, well, I, I don't know if that's a compliment or just the rather smug satisfaction that I won't be able to wander off again. Both. - Both? - Both. All right, here you are. You can find your way from here. You're not coming? Don't worry. You'll command enough attention on your own. I'm going to take another entrance. Have fun. Oh, uh, okeydokey then. Oh. All right. No way. Excuse me, I must compliment your dress. That shade of pink is divine. Oh, thank you so much. It's, uh, it's one of my favorites. The cut is so flattering. Did you buy it off runway? Can't be. I would remember that from fashion week. Um, it's actually the newest collection at Anna's boutique. It's the best kept secret in Manhattan. We must visit. Wait, are you a guest of Wyatt or Daisy? - Um... - Lindsay Arnold. I've heard so much about you. Oh, well, I wouldn't believe any of that. I'm nothing like her. Well, your father's a remarkable businessman, a real rags to riches type. Living the dream. Aren't we all? Ladies, you must be extra kind to Miss Arnold. Her father's industry can destroy reputations faster than a tidal wave to a sandcastle. We look forward to getting to know you. Thank you for the recommendation of Anna's boutique. It looks like Manhattan's best kept secret is concealed no more. Well, you ladies know secrets have a short shelf life around here. Bye. New money can be tough to break in. Have to use reputation as collateral. Thanks for the tip. Jacqueline Sims. I hope you don't mind I've asked the staff about you. I make it my business to know all people at any function. I didn't expect anyone here to know me. Actually, I didn't even expect myself to be here. Still not sure exactly how I got here. Hmm. Look. The king is here. King Hunter. Come on. Hunter... I want you to go over... He doesn't seem to be a fan of the PR's czarina? No, you need to be meeting people. Oh, his father hired her. Bit of a power struggle between the two. Ah. Okay, so tell me, Lindsay, what's it like living in Silicon Valley? Is it all flying cars and talking robots? Must be exciting. Those robots, they get a little fussy when you push all their buttons. Beep-beep-woo. So it's just like New York. Oh, yeah. Wow, how funny, right? Oh my God, is that shrimp? I love shrimp. I'll be back. You know, you can't hide from Eileen. Oh, maybe not, but I certainly can run. It's important for your brother, okay? And the company. We need this merger. Hey, I don't really see how promoting a wedding is going to make Red Wagon like us any more. Because the public will. Our financials should do that. We don't need to put on a show. It's the name of the game. You know this. Henry. Speaking of duty calls. Great. Make sure you speak with a strong speaking voice with an inflection. I'm introducing my son, not the New York Knicks. Thank you. Thank you all for coming. As a proud father, it's my pleasure to share this special occasion with close family and friends. So would you please help me welcome the bride and groom, Wyatt and Daisy. - Woo! - Woo! I cannot believe you made a plate. I wish I had that courage. Life is too short to say no to such beautiful food. Now if you would please join us for some dinner, we will start the marriage festivities. Ooh, dinner. There's a dinner? Of course. When are we supposed to eat? I don't know, maybe this giant table of food. Oh, no, no, Lindsay, you are too cute. Come on. Oh, I actually, I have to make a quick phone call. I'll meet you in there. Sure. See you in the banquet hall. Oh, oh... Oh, no, no, no, no. This is horrible. Jenna, where are you? We have big problems. Oh, no, they arrested you. No, it's actually worse. I'm on my way to a Slate family dinner at a dining hall. Okay, well, how did that happen? I thought you were leaving. Yeah, and so did I. But this chambermaid, she was so lovely and nice that she just came in, and she put me in Lindsay's dress, and now I'm her. You're wearing your dress? That's fantastic! Yes, that is the singular bright spot in this situation. This could be the miracle we need. I thought we were fine for, like, another month. I thought you said this could save the store. Mm. Maybe half. Oh, no. This could be our saving grace, you know? You're getting stuck with New York's elite, private fashion show to promote the store. What are you asking me to do? Stay? Stay, and be Lindsay Arnold for a whole week? Hey, you could be yourself. Just under a different name. I don't know. I mean, I met Hunter Slate. He seems nice. All the Slates seem nice, and I don't think I can lie to them for a whole week. - I can't. - Hunter? Is he as good-looking in person? Oh, gosh. What does that even matter? You're already on Hunter's radar. You can't really disappear tonight. If you leave, it could be disastrous. Well, I'm sure that he would prefer it if I left. He really doesn't seem to like the idea of some random influencer, this Lindsay Arnold, coming in and being a huge part of his family wedding. Come on, Jenna. This could really help save the store. Fine, fine, for the store, but if I need bail money, it is on you. You're going to be fine. I'll call you later, okay? Again, thank you for coming. Welcome. Ooh. Oh. Oh, my. Mm. Those rolls are just wonderful. They do look delicious. All right. Mmm. You know, they remind me of the ones at this place. It's called Remi's. It's right near my apartment in Soho, and they're amazing. That's exactly where they're from. My art studio is right there. Nancy, you should come by sometime. Get a taste of something different. Oh, no. I'm getting my fill now. Red wine, please. I wanted to use this dinner for some of you to get to know me better. I've chosen some of my favorite things to serve tonight. Mm. Also, if you'll take a look at the paintings on your place settings, I've created customized art pieces for each of you. Oh, careful, Lindsay. Yours might still be a little bit wet. I just made it since I didn't know much about you. I love it. I love it. Daisy, these are beautiful. I'm glad you guys like them. Thank you. This is well done. Oh. And now this might be a new experience for you, but true New Yorkers, eat cannoli with their hands. Isn't that right, Daisy? That's right. It's good, right? Well... Let's all adjourn to the family room, and please bring these gifts. Thank you, Daisy. Okay. All right. Thank you for that, Lindsay. Oh, for what? Being authentic and bold, like this dress, I love it. I think clothes should help you stand out, not blend in. I agree. As an artist, I hate conformity. Doesn't exactly help me blend in with Wyatt's crowd. Well, you know what? I think perfect is boring, and you are not boring. It's so nice meeting someone here who doesn't take themselves so seriously. I'm always here for a boost. Consider me your fairy godmother. Don't sell yourself short. You made that meal memorable. Daisy, we have your interview to get to. So let's move it along. Okay. Sorry. The PR stuns never end. Tomorrow, I want you on my croquet team. Please say yes. - Yes. Yes. - Yay. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. I really am in Wonderland. Oh... I was looking for the groundskeeper. Oh, he took the night off, lazy bum. I'm going to fire their guy. Hey, you think if I slip him a 20, he'll give me a tour of those private gardens? He could not be bribed. Well, then I will have to scale the gate. I can't figure you out, Lindsay Arnold. Who, me? Nothing to figure out? I'm sure the PR firm is dying to use you in whatever events they have planned for this wedding circus. Good night. Good night, Ms. Arnold. Lindsay. You can call me Lindsay. Good night, Lindsay. You can call me Lindsay. What is wrong with me? We need to talk about the schedules. Okay. And after that, we will go over the hairstyles and get that all together. Sorry, I'm late. Well, fashionably late. I love this dress. Is it Anna's boutique? Oh, thank you. Yes, I thought it looked sporty. Is it just us today? Oh, no, we're playing doubles. With who? Don't hurt yourself there, big guy. Oh, that's funny. All right. Enough chit chat. Let's play. Um... Okay. May I? Okay. Go slow... like that. Okay. Mm-hmm. Whoa, it looks like we've got a ringer. Good thing we didn't put money on this game, right, Hunt? Beginner's luck. Yes. Wow. So, I have to ask, how did you two meet? Well, I was carrying this huge canvas downtown to one of my art shows, and he offered to help me get it inside. I thought she was a collector, a potential client. You should have seen his face when he finally asked for my name and number. Could you believe she shared the same exact name as a talented artist I'd been explaining to her all day? To his credit, he was a fan. I still am. What about you? Any special someone? Oh, no, I work too much for dating. Oh, what do you do? Socialites have careers, now? Yeah. Women who work, it's kind of a hot new trend. Some women have been known to even run countries. Right now, I'm working with a small business to expand their merchandise at an affordable cost to help maximize profit. Hmm. I've never seen Hunter speechless. You gotta be careful with that, Lindsay. You're speaking his language. Oh. Eh. Is it my turn? Okay. This game really should have a clock. Patience is a virtue. Okay. He takes forever. - I know, I know. - Every time. Very well, you know. Not a victory, but it blocks Lindsay from winning. What? How? Can I just jump your ball? Well, you won't do that. And why wouldn't I? Because it's an advanced move. Go for it, Lindsay. I've never beaten these guys. We have to at least try. Um... Challenge accepted. Good. You have to jump my ball through the wickets and hit the pole to win. And that is exactly what I will do. Step aside. Thank you. Okay. - Oh, my God! - Woo! - Oh, my God. - No way. Well done. You surprised me again. Well, I seem to be pretty good at that. God, I wish I had my camera. Oh, uh, don't worry. I'm sure Eileen won't miss a moment. Right there. Um... Well, we can still go celebrate. Let's go. Well, she's got your attention. No, that was a lucky shot. I wasn't talking about her game. No, a typical social climber. She's different and you know it. Not everybody's out to take from the Slates, big brother. Huh? Maybe. You sure you don't want the bee venom, Lindsay? Oh. Oh, it looks painful. Beauty is pain. Well, maybe next time. Mm-hmm. I could get used to this. Used to what? Being pampered. Your father's in Forbes. You're telling me you're not getting weekly pedicures? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I usually go out for spa treatments. Having them in your home is nice. I had insisted. He knows how stressed I've been. If I had known this would be a wedding by committee, I would have gone to the courthouse. Really? It seems like a fairy tale. Yeah, that's what the PR firm wants you to think. You keep your nails short, too. Do you work with your hands? I can't wear a thimble with long nails. Wait, a thimble? Oh, are you darning your socks before churning the butter? I knew your dresses were too unique for store-bots. Anna's boutique gives me an outlet. It lets me design a little. You're an artist just like me. I think it's fantastic. A woman carving out her own path. - With a chainsaw. - Ignore her. In this world, appearances are everything. Sometimes I wonder if Wyatt and I should just live on an island. Daisy, you do. It's called Manhattan. You know what I mean. Okay. Wyatt wants you to be yourself. Be true to that, and everything else will fall into place. Enough with the mushy-mushy! Let's see the envy of social media. Come on. Oh, no, I have guacamole on my face. It's avocado, and you look fabulous. Besides, isn't this why you were invited in the first place? Oh. Okay. All right. What is that? Okay. No. Okay, you're embracing spa day a little too much. All right. Let's take another one. Oh, no. I'm a one-take wonder. Besides, this guacamole avocado concoction, I think it's starting to turn. Oh, I need to wash this off immediately. Ladies, enjoy. Are you okay? Yeah. Little sticky. Okay. I need a map. Lindsay. - Hello. - Hello. Nice ensemble. Uh, the spa day with the bride. I tried to escape before they brought out the bee venom again, but now I am lost. Bee venom is a beauty treatment now? Oh, that's good. I'll just hang out in my garden, catch a few stings, and then I'll be beautiful. Well, maybe a manicure would be more practical for you if you've been hiding in the garden again. Oh, you know what? I'm more of like a seaweed body wrap kind of guy, right? But do not tell Eileen because she finds out she'll have me in there with a camera crew wrapped up like sushi. So... Shh. Are we good? Oh. And speak of the devil. There you are, Hunter. We have you on the schedule for a photo shoot in the kitchen. You're late. Oh, oh, no. You know, I was walking around. This place is like a maze, you know, and she needs a map. Yes, luckily he found me before I had to, um, make camp. I've been calling. Never mind. Um, come. The camera crew is waiting. Five minutes. You too, Ms. Arnold. You'll be a good influence to help his camera presence. Okay. Five minutes. I'm gonna go... make camp. - I'll see you in five. - Okay. Lindsay will be out of hair and makeup shortly. Then we can start the shoot. Shooting what, exactly? You're making strawberry shortcakes. I thought it would be something nice to do for Wyatt and Daisy. You know, to include your mother. Yeah, that is nice. And do you have the recipe? Right in front of you. We tried picking strawberries in the garden, but it was locked. Yes, for good reason. I'm sure. Oh, Lindsay, you look lovely. Doesn't she, Hunter? Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. She'll look good for the camera. Hmm. Well, I'm counting on it. And maybe just a little boost on the apps from Dad, right, Lindsay? Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah. I heard my son was cooking. Didn't want to miss the bonfire. Oh, very funny. You know, toast is harder than it looks. Okay, let's get started. I need you two to chat. Pick up ingredients. Okay. Oh! Here are the eggs. Am I doing this face? Beat's me. With the whisk. Look happier, Hunt. Give a smile. The board at Red Wagon will love it. Okay. Okay, great. Perfect. We got what we needed. Okay. See, you call it micromanaging, but you need my guidance. Henry, are you ready for your bonding moment with Daisy on the lawn? Yes, I am. Whoa, wait, wait. Aren't we gonna make strawberry shortcake? Oh, no. We got what we needed. Thank you. I will have someone in here to clean everything up. And you are free to go. Unbelievable. Even this is fake. Well, you know, I'm actually in the mood for real strawberry shortcake. Yeah. You don't have to do that. Eileen may be phony, but we do not have to be. Take this whisk. Hold still. What are you doing? Whoops. Oh, I'm so good at this. Here I go. Nice. That's it. Okay. Yay. You know, my mom would never make a recipe with store-bought strawberries. Maybe I should go to my garden. You're not gonna hide in there, are you? Because you know I'm never gonna find you. I do not hide in my garden. Uh-huh. Yeah, okay. Then why is it all locked up? To keep Eileen out. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. The garden is where I can be myself. I can make mistakes without my dad micromanaging. Focus on what I want without the press commenting on my pruning technique or if I met a quarterly harvest. Hmm. I like the idea of a place to make mistakes. Yeah. Yeah, that's the beauty of the garden. You can try things and just see what blooms. I can be myself without worrying about this show that Eileen is putting on. Why is Eileen here? It's my fault. And my dad thinks this is the only way to fix it. So what really happened with the children's books? Oh. So you do know something about the Slates? People talk. People do. So what is the real story? It was my first move as CEO and I went with a cheaper book-binding company. They couldn't deliver, so I had to pull the donations. There was no books to give them, but the press ignored that and just made me look like a heartless monster. So, you made a mistake. You should get the truth out there. That's what I suggested. Just be honest. I just want to do things with integrity. Well, I'm sure it will blow over in time. People have short memories. Yeah, there is no time. We have an important merger coming up with Red Wagon Children's Publishing and if the merger doesn't go through, we're going to lose our stakes in our company. And this... this wedding will fix that? That's what my dad thinks. Aren't you CEO? Well, since the book blunder, my dad isn't letting go. He second-guesses everything I do. I'm sorry. Anyway, um... Should we, um, see how he did? We should. Let's... Mmm. That's good. Yeah, it's just like my mom's. Wyatt is going to love it. Thank you for making me look like I know how to cook. Oh. - Good morning. - Good morning. I was trying to sneak downstairs for a cup of coffee before Eileen roped me into something else. Tell me about it. I feel more like her little moving prop than a bride. Oh, that sounds tough. This wedding should be about you. Mr. Giraffe, can you fly, too? - Yes. - Do you hear that? Huh... Wow. You get so high up. Mr. Robot can fly. Aw... Mr. Turtle gives robot a ride. He's flying. You're going to make him walk? Aw... Cousin James's kids. Single dad. Looks like the Slate men are giving him a break for a bit. And not a camera in sight. Wow. Oh. Goldilocks and the three bears. That was your favorite, Wyatt? Yeah, you and Mom always did the best voices when you'd read to Hunter and I. Yeah. I thought it'd be fun if we read some of Wyatt and Daisy's favorite children's books to the kids. Daisy would love that. What was her favorite? Princess Paintbrush. Oh. Hi. Oh, let's sit down. Ah. Forgot my glasses. Here, Hunt. Why don't you and Miss Arnold read it? Like your mother and I used to. Oh, wow. I get to be Princess Paintbrush? Yeah. And I will be your prince. Okay, kids, sit there. Daisy. Good choice. "And the prince defeated the evil queen "to reach the tower to rescue his princess. "But the princess was distraught. "'Where is my magic paintbrush, dear prince?' "'I combed the kingdom for it, my princess. "'I would do anything to see your beautiful colors again.' "The princess leaps into the arms of the prince "as the prince pulled out her magic paintbrush "from his pocket. "'My hero. "'Let me paint our escape to happily ever after.' "'My princess, there is no need. "You are my happily ever after" "Princess Paintbrush looks into the eyes "of the prince. "And she paints the most beautiful hearts "around the two of them. The prince and princess kiss." - Eww! - Yuck! "They live happily ever after." Yes. They're the happiest. They're going to love this online, aren't they, Lindsay? Oh. That's interesting. Dad, what's going on? Well, it was such a perfect moment. I thought that Eileen might show Red Wagon. It was a perfect moment. No harm. Okay. Come on, kids. Let's go to the kitchen and raid it for some more shortcake, huh? Hup to, ba-ba-ba. Let's go. Let's go. Save some for us, Hunter made those for me. Okay. Thanks for that. It was nice to have a real moment, even if it was for a minute. Oh. Well, you make a great prince charming. Thank you. Oh. Oh, it looks like the people from Red Wagon have RSVP'd to the wedding. They mentioned the pictures of us making shortcake, specifically. That is great news. Thanks to you. You make me look happy, apparently. Oh, well, don't sound so thrilled about it. No, honestly, you've made this whole wedding show bearable. Still part of me just feels it's not right, you know, pretending like this. I know what you mean. But still, this is reason to celebrate. You're right. And I owe it all to you, Princess Paintbrush. I look forward to seeing the colors you paint the ballroom with tonight. Me too. Oh. Good evening, my dear. Ready to dress for the ball? Um... There's been a... mistake. I am not who you think I am. All right, stop it. You are a star to someone in this estate, Jenna. Wait, do you know who I am? Yes. I swear it was a mistake. I was just here dropping off dresses for Lindsay. No, no, calm down. I found your wallet days ago. I knew there was something different about you. Why didn't you kick me out? Sorry, I... I did it to help my friend. And things just got completely out of control, but I... I do not want to hurt anyone. No, I know, I know you have a good heart. I can see it. And I would never let anyone near Hunter who had bad intentions. Is this from Hunter? Does he know the truth about me? No, no, no, no, no. Your secret is safe. Open it. He wants to see me... for a walk in his private garden. Good. I should tell him the truth. No, you will not. I mean, he doesn't know who I really am. What's the difference? It's just... it's just a name. You will tell him when the time is right. Let's get you dressed. - Hey. - Hey. Thank you for coming. I feel like I'm a little bit overdressed. No, you look beautiful. Here, let me show you my garden. Yeah, it's a passion of mine. My mother, she got me into it. And we used to spend hours out here. And some of my favorite memories are here. Oh, wow. What are these? Those are azaleas. Originally cultivated in China. There's a Chinese legend that says there was a great emperor who won many battles. But he suffered from loneliness despite his success. One day, he was given azaleas. He became enchanted by their beauty, planted them in his garden, and when they first bloomed, he found his true love. Ever since then, they've been associated with luck, love, passion, and sudden happiness. I like that. They're my mom's favorite. To be honest, I have derived a great deal of inspiration being here. Yeah, inspiration for what? Aren't you an influencer? You push products on people? Not exactly. A lot of what I do involves helping people feel great about themselves. I just, you know, hate all this pretending that comes along with all this. Yeah. Oh. There's something I want to show you in here. Wow. Oh. Oh, so pretty. These are gorgeous. Yeah, it's my wedding gift to Wyatt and Daisy. They're night blooming flowers. The only bloom once a year. And it is said that if you kiss someone as they bloom, they will be your true love forever. Will they be ready in time? If I did my work correctly, yes, and every year on their anniversary. That is so romantic. Honest work for something you love. Hunter, there's something that I, um... Take a shot. Now. I want... Oh, okay. Looks like we're not alone. Yeah, we better go. This is the only place that's not tainted by Eileen's Circus. - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. Ooh. Careful. You know, it's okay. It's just a seam. I can fix this in a second. Okay. Yeah. Is this your inspiration? They're incredible. Oh, you think so? Well, I am no fashionista, but I know beauty when I see it. Okay. You fixed it so quickly. Well, sewing is second nature for me. Oh, wow. You really are something. Okay. Um... But let's turn around so I can check the fit. - Yeah, okay. - Yeah, okay. How does that feel? - Great. - It's okay. Good? Is it too tight? - No, it's great. - Okay. Well, it did all that looks good back here, so... Oh, okay. Turn... Yeah, that's Great. Thank you. Where'd you learn to do this? They don't have home ec in prep school. Um... Yeah, it's a funny story. But there is something I need to tell you. Well, now what is going on in here? You two are supposed to be heading down to the ballroom. Hunter, you're not even dressed. You're going to be late. Move along. Lindsay was about to tell me a funny story. Actually, I'm... You can tell him. Because you found my wallet the other day, and, um... Her driver's license was expired. Oh. How is that funny? - Um... - It isn't. Now, move along. Come on. Wyatt is going to expect you to be on time. Tonight, may I secure your first dance? Yes, of course. Good. Thanks. Bye. You almost ruined it. He deserves to know the truth. In due time, okay? Now, what should we do with your hair? What do you think about these? All of these people will be at the wedding tomorrow. Make sure you get pictures with all the VIPs. There you are. Okay, perfect. Hey, it's almost over. Then it's all about us, huh? Keep saying that. Feels like it'll never end. Hi. Can we get Eileen to cool it, man? I feel like a show pony. Oh, yeah. Well, you know, if she backs off you, then she's going to be all over me. And your coat is shiny and healthy. What are brothers for, bro? I'll talk to Dad. I'm sure you have enough wedding photos to last a lifetime. Wait until you get married, man. That'll shock the world. Well, maybe not so shocking. You might want to close your mouth before you go talk to her, though. All right. Don't be ridiculous. That is the look of love. You have been hanging out with artists too long. Hey, what can I say, man? We're romantic. Hi. Better go ask her to dance before cousin James, huh? Yeah. Hey, you know, I'll talk to Dad, you know. Daisy does deserve a wedding where she doesn't feel like a show pony. Yeah, she does. I got you. Thanks, man. James, hey, hey, I want you to go grab a drink. This lady promised me a dance. Of course. May I? - Yes. - Yeah. Oh, um, I'm not really used to dancing like this. Well, just follow and and I'll lead. I guess you get used to everybody staring at you all the time. Yeah. Oh! They're not watching me. They're wondering how this beautiful woman got Hunter Slate to dance. Hey, um... Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, um, I have to go. Oh. Um, just save me a dance. Yeah, yes, of course. - Yeah. - Yes. - Yeah. - Okay. - Oh, yeah. - Bye-bye. And bye. Lindsay, hi. You made him look approachable. The camera seems to love you two. Oh, is it, um, always like this? Well, they invited you for your father's influence, so the game never ends. Ooh, um... I think I need some air. Are you good? Some air. Lindsay? Oh. Daisy, what's wrong? Everything. I'm trapped. I can't have the wedding that I want. I mean, I really can't even be myself. Do you know what that's like? Uh, I... I do. It's awful. Wyatt says that Hunter's gonna do something to help, but... I don't know how. Well, Hunter seems to hate this just as much as you do, so I'm sure he'll do whatever he can. Eileen tells me what to say. She tells me where to stand, what to wear, how to kiss my own fiancé. What does Wyatt say? He's worried about his family and the merger. I know that we haven't known each other very long, but I think you are so creative and passionate, and you seem honest. Just keep being that girl, and I really think everything will work out. Do you really think so? Mm-hmm. Next time you're in Soho, come to my studio. Well, it is right next to Anna's boutique, so I'm gonna see you sooner rather than later. Sounds like a plan. Now, let's get you back to your party. Come on. Hey, how about a dance? Sounds good. Hey. Well, she seems to be in better spirits. Mm-hmm. Just needed a little girl time. Uh, I was thinking, can I talk to you in private? - Uh, yeah. - Let's go. Come on. Are we going to read another story? Yes, I have to go get my paintbrush. I... I forgot my props. Sorry. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I was thinking a lot about what you said. You're genuine. You're not afraid to be you. Well, it's the only way I know. Actually, it inspired me. Really? Yeah. In... in what way? I took your advice, and I'm gonna talk to my father about this PR wedding, about being honest with Red Wagon, running the business. That is so wonderful. I really think you're doing the right thing. Well, I know my dad has his way of doing things, but if I'm gonna take over, I have to do things my way. Wyatt and Daisy are... are lucky to have you. Yeah. You know, I... I feel like the lucky one. Oh. Am I interrupting? No, Dad. Come on in. Miss Arnold, you've made quite an unexpected impression tonight. Oh. Oh, my. I hope that is a good thing. Now, in my experience, yes. Well, uh, please say hello to your father for us. Yes. Of course, I will. Oh, well, I should get back to the ball, so I'll let you two... talk. A good evening. Oh. Uh... I'll come find you. Hey, are you okay? I can't do this anymore. But you're doing so well. I saw you dance. The feelings are too real. I can't lie to somebody that I respect this much. Look, go upstairs to your room. We will figure this out. Just... just apologize first. Hunter, I'm so sorry. Oh! What the... - Daisy. - I'm so sorry. I didn't know where else to go. I called off the wedding. What? Why? You and Wyatt were just dancing. Eileen pulled me aside to go do a final photo of me looking at my wedding dress only that was not my dress. They took out everything that was really me. The artistic elements, the color, the veil, and I just lost it. I lost it, and I took your advice. Well, I mean, I didn't... I didn't... I didn't say call off the wedding. The dress was the one thing that was really me, and I needed one thing to be real. Yeah. Well, what did Wyatt say? He was very diplomatic. Supporting both sides. You know, I really thought that he would stand up for me. I love Wyatt so much, but I just can't live the rest of my life like this. It's too much. We're printing books around the clock. We'll have the donation by next month. Next month? The merger is happening next week. Let me go to Red Wagon. I'll be honest with them. I'll tell them my mistakes, and how I'm correcting them. That's not how business works. Well, then we'll do business a different way. Dad, I can do this. This wedding has to go off without a hitch. The wedding's off. Whoa, wait, what? Daisy called off the wedding. She can't possibly... Oh, she can and she did. Should have just eloped like we wanted to. Son, you did it for the greater good. Really? What's that, Dad? Maybe we can talk to her. Yeah, maybe there's a compromise between... Oh, she shouldn't have to compromise. I fell in love with Daisy for who she is. Not who Eileen has created in the press. Now I let the Slates down. And I let her down. I'm sorry. Hey, Wyatt? Wyatt! This is why I can't hand over the reins so quickly. Jenna, this is not your fault. Yes, it is. I encouraged Daisy to be herself, and now the Slates are going to lose everything. No, I have known the Slates for 20 years. They always find a way to win. I... Excuse me. Hey. I'm sorry for knocking so late. I really have to talk to you. No, I need to talk to you as well. - Good night, Diana. - Good night. I will see you in the morning, Miss Arnold. Good night to you both. So, I got bad news. - Daisy... - Call off the wedding. I know, she told me. Is there any way to convince her otherwise? I don't know. She loves Wyatt, but she can't be somebody she's not. Oh, I get it. I really do. This is all my fault. What? How... How could this possibly be your fault? I kept telling Daisy to just be herself, but I didn't think she would call off the entire wedding. You're right. She should be herself. Hiring the PR firm was a mistake. You really think that? Yeah. I spoke to my father. How did that go? Not well, and this whole fiasco hit. No. This has all gone too far. No, I don't think so. I mean, you can... you can fix a bad impression, as long as you're your genuine self. I mean, you taught me that. Yeah. Um... I'm a hypocrite. What? Um... My name is not Lindsay Arnold. It's Jenna Preston. Um... I'm a seamstress at Anna's boutique. Lindsay ordered dresses from us, and I was there dropping them off, and somehow everyone mistook me for Lindsay. And when I got here, everybody started asking me about my dresses, and I got so excited about helping Anna store. And then, of course, I didn't want to create a scandal, so I just sort of kept going along with it. But then I met you, and I... I didn't know how to tell you the truth. You're not Lindsay Arnold. No, but everything else I told you was true. The only thing I lied to you about was my name. I'm so sorry. I swear, I didn't mean for any of this to happen. This was all just... This was a huge mistake. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was. I should go before I do any more damage. Yeah, I think that's for the best. Um, for what it's worth? Nothing that the press said about you as a man is true. I wish everyone knew that your heart is always in the right place. Was all this just self-serving? Honestly, I've asked myself that question. It started with me really just wanting to help my friend. But I promise, I never meant to cause any harm. Please keep this experience to yourself, at least while the merger hangs into balance. I know you may not believe me, but I would never betray you or your family's trust. My name may be different, but... my feelings are true. I just... Jenna, you're back. Wait, why? The wedding's this weekend. Wedding is canceled. But it's the social event of the season. What happened? I happened. I ruined everything with this ridiculous lie. When I told you to stay, I didn't know you were going to get so close to the Slates. Neither did I! I thought, oh, yeah, I'll just stay for a while, promote the store, then come home, not blow everything up. Well... You did help the store. - Really? - Yeah. Assistants came and they bought dresses for their bosses and... Oh, the sketches you sent me. I had them made. These are your best work. Your time at the Slates inspired genius. Hunter couldn't even look at me. You got really close to him, huh? Then talk to him. I don't know what to... I'm just another phony PR stunt to him. If I know anything, it's that you are never phony. For the first time in my life, I really did, I felt like a leading lady. You can still have your dream. That's the problem with dreams, is that eventually you got to wake up. Jenna. Good morning, Hunter. Yes, thank you. A cup of tea, just the way you like it? I can pour my own. It's no trouble. You think it's my fault that we'll lose the company? No, that is not what I was thinking. Okay. No. You need to find Jenna. Oh. She turned out to be more fictitious than the PR stunt she showed up for. No, she sacrificed herself to help out a friend. That sounds like something you would do. She was faking it. Just like our business practices and this wedding. I can't trust someone like that. Hunter, I was the one that told her to keep the truth a secret. Why would you do that? Because she touched your heart like nobody ever has. She lied. No, just about the name. Everything else was the truth. She's one of the few people that knows why this wedding was called off, and yet there has been no mention of it in the media. I wish the circumstances were different. Please don't punish her for one mistake. You, of all people, should have compassion for that. It's Jenna calling again. Okay. Yeah, you have my number, right? Okay. Thanks. Maybe it really is busy. I know he never wants to see me again. I just... I need to know that he's okay. I wish I had never met him. Of course. Because I always call guys that I wish I'd never met over and over and over again. What are these? Hunter's Garden inspired me. It's new designs, but it's silly, right? No. I love them. These are gonna be a hit. I know it. Fate works in mysterious ways. Well, fate seems pretty cruel. I mean, not only did I hurt Hunter, I destroyed somebody's wedding. Who does that? Oh, hey. Do you mind getting that? I've got some orders to fulfill. Yes. Gonna be okay. Daisy? What are you doing here? You told me that I could come and visit Anna's. - Of course. - So I came. I am so glad you found me. Me, too. Things got pretty intense at the estate. Is everyone okay? Yeah. Henry has been working double time with the PR team, and Hunter has been hiding himself away either in the garden or his office working on a plan to save the merger. I am so sorry that I didn't tell you. I wasn't Lindsay Arnold. You don't have to apologize. I had a feeling you weren't really an influencer. I didn't ruin your relationship? Wyatt and I realized that we only need each other, not the press or the business or any of that. We're focused on our marriage, not a merger. That is so beautiful. I'm relieved. I am so glad you guys are still getting married. Of course we are. And we're doing it our way. I'm just missing one last thing. What? I can't find a dress, or at least not one that really feels like me, you know? Ah. Well, I just might be able to help you with that. Could you? Daisy, it would be an honor. Thank you. I can't wait to tell Wyatt. Yeah, is that, um, is it going to be okay with the Slates if I design it? I mean, I just, Hunter... Would Hunter... You know what? Never mind. Honestly, I don't really know, because I haven't spoken to him. Even Wyatt has only caught glimpses. I think he just needs a little time alone to sort it out. Sure. That makes sense. So tell me about your dream dress. Yes, I'm aware of that. Yes, Eileen, can we talk later? Thank you. Hey. What is this? That is the details of our merger. How? I went in and talked to Red Wagon. We had an honest and blunt conversation. They told me their concerns, and I told them why it's in their best interest to merge with us. Total transparency. And that worked? We finalized the deal on Monday. Well, I'm impressed, son. If I'm going to run a company, I'm going to have to run it my way. I'll make some mistakes, but so did you. You're going to have to trust me. Maybe it's time I step back. Let's you run the show. No show. Just business. I'm proud of you. Thank you. I'm still going to need your help. I want the Slate Charities to be a family organization. Wyatt, Daisy, everyone. Daisy, is the wedding back on? In the only place the PR machine can't touch it. - Oh, yes. - I love that. Oh, that's beautiful. Do you mind, Anna? Thank you. Ooh, I have an idea. - Wait right there. - Okay. Okay, I'll be right back. Okay. How do we feel about a little pop of color? It's kind of wild. Right? - I love it. - Yes. And we can put some in your hair, too. Like maybe just a little, is that accent? Oh, I love that. It's different. It's what I want. - Yeah. - I love it. All right, good. I just want to say thank you. This is amazing. Well, now you know why I never let you in here. Hey, come on. It's my wedding day. You know, I'm pretty. Pretty obnoxious. Really, though. Thank you. I'm happy for you. Daisy is perfect. And the way she stood up to this family, right? Mom would have loved her. Oh my God. You are absolutely gorgeous. The most beautiful bride. It's gorgeous. I really feel like a princess. Thank you, Jenna. Oh, well, you make the dress, not the other way around. And there's those azaleas. Yes. And they represent love, luck, passion, and sudden happiness. Perfect for your fairy tale. I'm ready to go get my prince. Yes. Well, it's not the wedding that I planned. And two, and two. Whoa! What a spin. Diana, I hope you saved a dance for me. Oh, beautiful bride. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Have fun. Son... Well, they did it their way. And happier for it. I'm proud of my son today. Both of them. Thanks, Dad. All right, well, I will see you two on the dance floor. You're dancing. You're going to... Oh, he didn't even hesitate. Jenna, you can't leave. My work is done. Yes, but the party is just starting. Please, come on. Go congratulate the happy couple. They're right out on the patio. I will another time. It really was a beautiful ceremony. Yes. Yes, it was. And those night-blooming flowers were the perfect backdrop. You should go see them close up before you leave. Please, the party is out on the patio. If you change your mind. Thank you. I thought they would bloom in time, but they fooled me. I'm sure with a little grace, they will bloom. And they will steal the show, no doubt. I tried to call. I wanted to explain everything. There's no need. I know the truth. It was like I tried on this new me, and then I started to like it. And I'm just, I'm so sorry. Hey, can I say something? Yes, of course. Thank you. For everything. You changed all of this for the better. Without you, none of this would have happened. It was you sharing this garden that made it possible. Not only the wedding, but I got the merger. My way. And the support of my father. Yes! Congratulations, Hunter. I'm... I'm so excited for you. Well, you inspired me to be myself. Yeah. Well, I... I wish I'd been myself the first day we met. Well, you were. I mean, you weren't trying on a new you. You were just stepping out of the shadows and into the spotlight. I'm ready to step into the spotlight with you. Yeah, well, Let's start our next chapter, Princess Paintbrush. I feel like I'm in a fairy tale. Well, then, let's begin with happily ever after.
