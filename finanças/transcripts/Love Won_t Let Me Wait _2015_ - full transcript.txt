[upbeat music] - Okay Troy, I get it okay? No I'm not crying, my eyes are just watering from the onions in put in the dinner I fixed for you. You what? You love me and you miss me? No. You don't love me, you love what I gave to you, and that's what you miss. Troy, I gave you my heart and my soul, and you just walk in and out my life, like you got a free pass? You know what? Goodbye, Troy. And do me a favor, lose my number. - You okay? Hey Ms. Eadie, how are you? - Hi, Mr. Johnny, how are you? - I'm doing fine, how's your day going? - Pretty good I guess, I just got used to it. - Ah Ms. Eadie? - [Eadie] Yes? - [Johnny] You know that restaurant, that new one, down there on Woodward Avenue? - Yeah? - Well they're looking for some folks to hire. - Okay, Mr. Johnny-- - You, you still looking for a job ain't you? - Yeah, just give me a minute, I'll be right back. - Ms. Eadie, Ms. Eadie baby. A good job like that ain't gonna last too long, this Detroit you know. - Okay. [phone ringing] - You want me to get this? - Yes, could you please? Oh, no, no, no. I got it, I was expecting a call. - That's all right, I got it. - I said I got it! - All right if you feel like that Ms. Eadie, you can have it, I'ma go back and work on this pipe. - Hello, hello. - [Voiceover] Yo what's up? Is this Eadie? - Yeah who is this? - [Voiceover] Yo, it's Justin Ladinmore. But you know, most of my peoples be calling me Big Daddy. - Big Daddy? And where do I know you from? - [Voiceover] You know I met you at the Club Cabaret last Friday night. - How did you get my number? Anyway honey, I don't remember meeting you, unless you're that fine bald-headed brother who came over to our table and bought everybody a drink. - [Voiceover] Yo, who else could it be? I had on my back body shirt, you know, I'm like about 6'4", 220. - Oh, and didn't you say you were a professional football player? - [Voiceover] Uh yeah, you know what, as a matter of fact I did. But that's neither nor here, nor there, but yo I was wondering if I could come by, you know, maybe hang out with you and-- - Yeah hold on a second. Michelle, what are you making in there? - Chicken and rice and stuffed cabbage. - Honey, you're in luck. I just so happen to be making chicken, rice and stuffed cabbage. Why don't you hold on while I go check on that. - Hey Eadie, can you help me with some of this... Now where did she go that fast? - [Voiceover] Hello, hello? - Hello, praise the Lord. - [Voiceover] Oh that was quick. Yo tell me something, ey you got that chicken and rice ready? - Excuse me, who is this? - [Voiceover] Yo I told you, it's Justin. You know tell me something, you got them juicy drumstick legs ready? Cause Big Daddy over here hungry. - What does this look like, Popeyes Chicken? - [Voiceover] Well you said-- - Hold on. What church do you go to? Do you know who Jesus is and what he did for you? Have you accepted Jesus as your Lord and personal savior? Do you pay your ties and offering? Hello, hello? Gets them every time. Don't no brother wanna hear nothing about the Lord. - Hello, hello, hello? Michelle, what happened to my call? [humming] Look Miss Holy Child. I'm not playing with you, what happened to my phone call? - I don't know. He must'a had a demon or something. As soon as I mentioned the name Jesus, he was gone, just like Troy. Do you know the Bible says: "If you mention that name, the devil will flee from you." - Why did you do that? That's the man who bought me a drink at the club, and he could've been my new man. - [Michelle] I have a new man for you and his name is Jesus. - Save it Michelle, nobody wants to hear all that religious stuff. And Eadie, why do you think that when a brother buys you a drink, it automatically qualifies him to be a member of your family. Did he sponsor your car note this month? Did he subsidize your rent? Did he eradicate your student loan? Or better yet, did he deposit a few Benjamins in your hand and tell you to shop till you drop? Did he, did he? - Dang, what's your first name, Puff? I just met the man, give him a break. - Can he show me some paper? - Yes, show me the paper, where's his baptism certificate? - Is he Fortune 500? - Is he spirit-filled? - Y'all need to quit hating. - And you need to quit matin'. You remember the last guy you brought up in here, what was his name? - Who, Eddy? - I thought it was Freddy. - Don't be petty, his name was Teddy. - What's the difference anyways? - Uh, see that's your problem right there, Hotel Eadie. Anybody with pants on is attractive to you. - No, not just anybody. A man's body. Girlfriend, you need a man. - And you need a hotel clerk. You need a wakeup call, girl. You keep on messing around and God is gonna-- - God gonna what? He gonna punish me? God ain't interested in a sister from the East side, because if he was, he sent me a soldier. Hey, I need a soldier! - You need stop all that gyrating, that is not holy. The Lord doesn't like it when you're a critic. - Why are you two always chiding? - [Both] Chiding? - Where do you think you are, back in Canada? Honey, this ain't the North Pole. You would've thought that if Mama had a baby, by a white man she wasn't married to, at least he could've been American white. You ain't even American. Let me see your birth certificate. - Listen Eadie, I'm as black and American as you are. - I said, let me see your birth certificate. Oh where you from, Switzerland? What's that other place, where they be French kissing? - France, stupid. - Yeah, nooda! - You two have nothing better to do with your time, than to sit here and debate over men who could care less whether you're on a course to heaven or a course to hell. As long as they can intercourse with you. - Shut up, Michelle. - Men are simply disgusting. - Well honey, I'm like the marines, I could use a few good men, and Michelle, you just need a man, my Eddy could hook you up. - With who, the police? - [Eadie] Girl, bye. - Anyway, Michelle, so how's your precious Troy doing? - We broke up. - Well that figures. You know you and Eadie are just sickened with adulation for the opposite sex. - And what are you Ashley, sickened with adula, ajuda... - Goofy. - Oh whatever. Whatever you said for the same sex. - Now Ashley, I hope you're not going that way, because the Bible says, that God will turn you over to a reprobate mine if you don't honor him as God. - Michelle go in the kitchen and cook something please. And Eadie you were born with the reprobate mine. You seem to have matriculated yourself into some kind of Quixotic aura that has totally narcotized your brain. - Oh you need to come up off all that girlfriend, 'cause I know where you from Ms. Trailer Trash, yo problem is you think you too smart for most men. - Well at least I'm smart enough to know that when I do get another man, he won't be broke like your daddy or some plumber, or grease monkey... Oh, hey Mr. Johnny, how you doing? - Hey Ms. Ashley how you doing? - I'm good, I'm-- - Oh, I just been in the back, back there working on that garbage disposal. And I found this, all clogged up in the pipe. Uh, y'all got a puppy dog around here? - My momma. - Hey Mr. Johnny, gimme that. - Just what, well well, you can have it. I must go and run out to my truck and get some more tubes and uh, I'ma be back in a minute, y'all be nice now. - Yeah you do that. - Now back to you. - Back to me. - Ain't nothing wrong with a plumber honey, as long as he can fix the problem. - And you know it really doesn't matter what kind of job a man has, as long as he loves the Lord and pays his ties and offering. - Excuse me? Ugh, that was the problem with your father. See, he wears his broke-ass Granddaddy's pocket watch, but you know what, I guess as long as he was, praising the Lord, and shouting Hallelujah, raising his hands, everything was okay? Please, both of you, are delusional. Just stuck in some imaginary journey, okay? - You know what, this ain't working for me. I can't be living with Juanita "Buyin' 'em up" Lord and Ellen DeGenerate everyday of my life. I know we out here camping with Mama till we get back on our feet. But it's time for me to go. Besides, my Eddy gonna take care of me. [funky music] [phone ringing] - Hello, praise the Lord. Hmm-mm. Eadie, it's Eddy. He wants to know if you have that 20 dollars he loaned you last week. Hold on, Eddy. - Eddy, don't be calling here asking for no 20 dollars with your broke behind. I gotta go. Why? Cause I'm a conjunction meeting, that's why, dang! - Eadie, Eadie! You don't have to leave! Listen, we'd all be gone if things were better. I lost my job, so what? I'll find another one. And as much as you don't like him now, I know losing Eddy was hard. Or was it Teddy? - Honestly, I think it was Freddy. And maybe Eadie should've kept the gates closed, or at least charged admission price. - What? You just jealous cause they be lined up for me. - What? - Men don't want no bootlegging loving, they want the real thing baby. [laughs] - You know why they're lined up? Because you keep giving out complimentary tickets, that's why. - And you know why your marriage failed? Because your mouth is always in first gear. - [Michelle] Ladies! - [Ashley] Whatever. - Come on now. We need to start acting like real sisters. Because we are, even though we do have different fathers. - Wow, what a revelation. Look at us, we look like exhibit A, B and C. You know what Michelle, maybe you're right. Maybe we do need to treat each other better. - That's right. - We must stick to our virtues, we can't become intransigents. We must remain incredulous, when dealing with the opposite sex. - What? - Especially with men who are of an impecunious nature. What are you doing? - Trying not to step on all that bull you talking. [laughing] - Oh, okay. - Ashley, what did you have for lunch today, a dictionary? - Ignorant. - Michelle, I feel so [mumbling]. - You're ignorant. - Girl you are stupid. Now wait a minute. I was not talking about men. I was talking about us living together, and being together. We weren't meant to be alone. It's God's plan for us to have each other. - No, we have each other, because we're broke. Okay? And not to mention that none of us, none of us, can find a good man. - Ashley, it's not meant for you to find a good man, the Bible says that he will find you. - Well you know what Michelle, why don't you just go and put an add out in the paper, in the lost and found, okay? "Lost, one lonely church girl." [chattering] - Lord, have mercy. Jesus! Woo, I'm so tired. I've been at that unemployment office all day long today. Up and down, walking back and forth, my feet are so swollen, they feel like big old yams. [laughing] How y'all doing? - [Girls] Hey Auntie. - Hey, my sweet girls, is for horses. And does Auntie look like a horse? - Well, all I know is Auntie, there's a horse running around here somewhere, [whinnies], without a tail. - Oh, oh, oh, you trying to hate on the girl, you better back up off of me. Shoo. Lord I'm tired. I have to get another job. Or find a good man, and the way things are looking nowadays, both is pretty hard to come by. - Well Michelle here seems to think that he'll find you. - That's right, Ashley. That's what the good word says. - Well honey, call 'em up and tell 'em where I'm at. - Well anyway Auntie, why do you need another job? You just got this one. - Well. If you must know. - [Ashley] Yes. - I got fired. - Fired? - Yes, I got fired. - Auntie, you didn't need to be a security guard anyway, who is you gonna protect? - Now hold on now y'all. - You have bad knees. - You're too old. - Excuse me? - I, I mean... - Let me tell you what happened. This guy came and tried to rob the joint. - What? - Now he, he trying to rob us, I pull my gun. I said if you take one more move, I'ma lullaby you. - And what did he do? - Child, he took one more move. And I shot him. - [Eadie] Auntie! - [Michelle] Auntie, what? - I sure did, I shot him in his behind. - Oh Jesus. - I sure did, and anyway, I didn't want that old devilish gun. But you wanna know what was really bad? - [Michelle] What's that? - [Eadie] What? - That man was so fine. - Oh Auntie, he was fine? - Oh he was fine girl, he had the skin of The Rock, the body like The Rock, and he was strong-- - Desperate! - He had good hair, and everything, he looked like Adonis, he was just, [grunting]. - Thirsty. - You thirsty too and hungry, shut up, let me tell you girl, he was fine. But I had to shoot him in his behind. - Now, now, Auntie, I thought you were saved. - I am saved! - The Bible says, "No lusting!". It's right here. - Okay, Michelle, now I appreciate you for that, and I am saved. As a matter of fact. I am pure as the driven snow. - And no lying. - No baby, let me tell you something, no one has walked on my snow. Not only am I pure. I'm virginal. [coughs] I'm like the virgin Mary. Reincarnated. Ain't nothing touched me. Because I am pure. [laughs] - Except you are the immaculate misconception right? [laughing] - You sure are brave, you are so brave to talk to somebody who just shot somebody. - Oh! - Oh... - Auntie just shot somebody honey, don't do that to yourself, don't do that. - La la la la la, la la la la la, girls, I just had the most wonderful audition with the most beautiful director. ♪ The hills are alive ♪ With the sound of music - My baby sister the space cadet. - Oh Momma you so crazy. - Girls, things are gonna get so much better, I know they are. - Why do you say that Mama? You got the part? Are you gonna be a big star? - Not yet. But things are gonna get so much exciting, I can just feel it. Isn't today a beautiful day? The Creator has blessed us all today, ain't that right, Willia Mae? - The Creator, gal let me tell you something, you know Big Momma and them used to call Him, Sweet King Jesus. - Amen. - Oh he's the rock! - [Mother] That's right. - He put a fire in your soul! Oh hallelujah, Jesus, hallelujah, hallelujah. - Okay, okay, okay, Willia Mae. Calm down. - So Mother, where did you get the new dress huh? - Yes, Mom, it's beautiful, where did you get the dress? - Oh this little thing? Just a lil' something something. - A lil' something you stole from Macy's. - I did no such thing. Anyway, today is in perfect harmony. Can't y'all just feel the energy all around us? - Mother why can't you act civilized and sagacious for a change. You know what? I do feel it. And it's coming from your mouth. Here, try a mint. There you go. - Does my breath stink. - Hmm. - Coulda swear I brushed my teeth. - No you didn't, take two. - Oh dang. - God. You know what, all of this is ridiculous, I can't take this anymore. - What's wrong, honey? - What's wrong, Momma? What's wrong is I can't stand this two-bit apartment. I'm tired of these dollar store lamps, and I'm tired of being broke. And frankly, I'm sick and tired of you. [gasps] - [Willia Mae] Miss Ashley, watch yourself girl. - As a matter of fact, you, are giving me a headache. - You know what Ashley, you've gone too far. - Ashley baby, did you have another bad day today? - Momma don't worry about her, she been tripping all day. - Tripping? Oh sweetie, you haven't seen me trip yet, I'm just getting started. - You just need some prayer. Prayer will change everything Ashley. You need to let go and let God. - [Willia Mae] Amen. - Your breakthrough is in your prays. Your deliberate-- - Michelle. Stop with all your preaching. Your prays and your prayers hasn't done you or anybody in here any good, thank you. [door knocking] And I guess I'll get that. - Do something. - Praise you, praise the Lord, look here, I'm looking, I mean, praise the Lord, I'm... Looking for, [stammering], Sister Jackie. - Oh I'm sorry y'all. Forgot I brought company home. Come on in reverend, I didn't mean to leave you waiting out there so long. - Oh it's okay. Praise the Lord. - Timeout Mama, who's your new friend? - Oh, this is Reverend James W. Buckworth. Reverend, these are my three beautiful daughters, and my sister Willia Mae. Ain't they all beautiful and blessed? - Oh, I must say they truly, truly are blessed. I mean, may God be the glory. I must say you all are really abundantly blessed. From the crown of your head to your little sexy feet. [giggles] - Ah, Mama! Where did you find him from? - Uhm, well I was paying the cable bill, and the reverend was nice enough to pay the bill for me. - Oh yes, let's just say I have some friends in some high places. [laughing] - Amen. - [Rev. Buckworth] Hallelujah. - And then we started talking. And the next thing I know, I ended up with this beautiful dress. Thank you. - You're welcome. [phone ringing] - I'll get that in the kitchen, it's probably Freddy. - Oh children, always got something shaking. - Hmm-mm, you can say that again. - Uhm, excuse me Momma. - What? - But what Cracker Jack box did you get Reverend Duckworth from? - It isn't Duckworth, it's Buckworth. - Well for what it's worth, he obviously isn't a real preacher. My goodness, has he had his shots yet? - Is he good in bed? - [Both] Ashley! - Well the real question is, is Reverend Duckworth, I mean, Buckworth, worth a buck, 'cause frankly, I don't think he is. I mean what school did he go to? Does he have a degree? - I think he went to Martin Luther King High, like everybody else. Reverend? - Uhuh? Ahem, yes. - Where did you get your degree from? - Oh uh, I got my Masters of Theology from the distinguished private college, U of E. - [All] U of E? - What is that? - Oh, University of eBay. I took online classes of course, but you can tweet me. Tweet-tweet. [laughing] - So what's the name of your church? - Oh, well, the, the, the name of it is kinda long, but I think it's applicable. It's called, "The True Soldiers "of the Antioch First Redeemed Church "of the Latter Rain, and Snow." - Amen. - Eddy goes there! - Yes, I seen Eddy there, and our theme, you love it is, and our philosophy is that, we believe every man and every woman, praise the Lord, has a right to express themselves in the most efficacious matter possible. In accordance with the fifth degree of extraterrestrial magnificence. In accordance to a divine auspiciousnesses. - What the hell did you just say? - What's the name of your church? - You know, well I done told you the name of the church, all right? You know what Ms. Jackie? I think I better wait outside, cause, your little daughters are getting a little too exquisitive, and it's starting to scratch me the wrong way. - Uh, it's inquisitive, and rubs me the wrong way. - Yeah, that too. - Okay reverend, I'll see you on Sunday. - Yeah, praise the Lord, I see you Sunday. - Okay, amen. - Hallelujah. - What is wrong with y'all? - Oh, that's my cue to go to the restroom. Don't hurt em, Jackie. - I am so ashamed of you girls. I never raised y'all to think that y'all was better than nobody. That was just pathetic how y'all treated the reverend. - What's pathetic, is that your friend is stuck on phonics. - Ashley, don't you start now. - You know what Mama, you're right. You didn't raise us to think we were better than anybody else, you know why? Because you didn't raise us at all. So we always thought everybody was better than us. - Now why you gotta go and hurt Mama's feelings? So what if the man has a limit on his vocabulary, and so what if Mama didn't raise us? At least she had enough sense to leave us with Auntie while she was getting better. - Well 10 years is a long time to get better. And if you think, that leaving us with a lunatic like Aunt Willia Mae makes sense, then you need your head checked out. - Ashley didn't mean none of that what she said, did you, did you? - Girl you better... - Eadie, stop it! - Ashley why are you so angry? - Why don't you ask your mother? - So Mama made some mistakes? Who hasn't? Didn't God forgive you of your sins [mumbling]? - I don't know, Michelle, I wasn't there. - We have all sinned, and come short of his glory. - Evangelist Michelle, do you have to preach all the time? All you need is a deacon and a pulpit. Let's get one thing straight. I'm not trying to be a saint. - Oh we know that. You ain't trying to be much at anything but a gold digger. - You know what, gold digger, you can learn a few things from me! [incoherent chattering] - Stop it, stop it, stop, stop! This is all my fault, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ashley baby I'm sorry. I know I should've been there for you. I should've been there to braid your hair. I should've been there to walk you to school. Baby, I should've been here to see how pretty you were at prom. - How about when I got married, Mama? That would've been a nice time to be around. I mean Aunt Willia Mae tried the best she could for years, but that wasn't nearly enough. - Baby I said I'm sorry. Ashley, I know I should've been there. But I was sick. I should've been there, but baby I couldn't. - Whew, Lord. Did I hear somebody say they was sick? Girl, I keeps me some Pepto-Bismol in my purse, it works magnificently wonderful for me. - No, I'm all right, Willia Mae. - You all right? Did somebody say something to you? - No, it's all right. - What happened in here? Oh nobody ain't got nothing to say, huh? Maybe I can loosen some tongues up in here. Somebody gonna say something. - Willia Mae! Put that blade away. Ashley listen to me. I got so caught up in drugs and alcohol, I lost everything except you girls. Baby everything was stolen from me. - Did you forget, Mama? I too know what it's like to have something stolen from me. - But I'm clean now baby, look at me. - I was just a baby, when you ran off with your druggie friends, remember. - Ashley! - No, Michelle! I'm gonna finish this. What was I left with, Mama, huh? Raising my sisters, that's what. Momma I needed somebody to raise me. That's why I married the wrong man, Steve was your friend, but you were too drunk to notice, what he was doing, and I was too young to stop him. Don't you know you stole the best years of my life from me. - Oh stop it, please. Yes your mama left you. She left you for that pathetic sorry white man, who was your daddy. And she ran off with him, and he cheated on her day and night, and she was good enough to be his bed partner, but she wasn't good enough to bring around his family or his friends. So what she did was she ran up and got involved with drugs and alcohol, now let me tell you something. She had enough sense not to let you see her be in despair. Your mother was in sorrow. And she left you with me. - So she dropped us in your lap. That makes sense. - Look here you little [mumbling]. You better back up off of me. Now I may be saved, but I was raised in the hood, and you can meet that side of me too. - Willia Mae, Willia Mae, stop it. - No, no, you my sister. You my sister, and I love you. And I ain't ashamed of you no way, no how. - I love you too, Willia Mae. Eadie. You're just like me. - I love you Mama. - And I love you too, baby. - Michelle, I should've been there for you too when you... You got baptized and you joined that church. - Mama! - I'm sorry. - Mama don't worry, it's okay. I understand. Things happen for a reason. God's gonna work it out. - Michelle, you're right. God is gonna work it out. And Ms. Jackie, all you got to do is believe that everything is gonna be okay, and, God's gonna make it okay, because God never fails. Y'all believe that? - I believe it. - You believe that Ms. Jackie? - Yes I do. ♪ Hey when the going gets rough ♪ Things start to get tough ♪ You feel deep inside you done ♪ Had enough ♪ When you look to your left ♪ And then to your right ♪ And somehow you know there is no ♪ Hope inside ♪ You just lift your hands ♪ Look to the sky ♪ Somebody bigger than ♪ You and I, and he's a problem-solver ♪ Yeah ♪ He's a problem-solver ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ When your bills pile up ♪ You ain't got a cent ♪ The first rolls around and you ♪ Can't pay your rent ♪ You look in your cupboard ♪ And they are there ♪ Trying for a friend ♪ And there is nobody there ♪ You just lift your hands ♪ Look to the sky ♪ Somebody bigger than ♪ You and I ♪ And he's a problem-solver ♪ Yeah ♪ He's a problem-solver ♪ Yeah ♪ He's a problem-solver ♪ He's a problem-solver ♪ Oh, oh, oh Oh Ms. Jackie you know I, care about you and them kids.

One thing is for sure, she will always be Mama, and there's nothing that you or anybody else can do to change that. - Have you forgotten what she's done to us? - Ever since your little divorce you been getting on everybody's case, that was your mess. That's what happens when you just go after the money. Michelle, what the Bible say about money? - It says, the love of money, is the root of all evil. - And what does it say in there about sack chasers? Because I'm sure there's something in there about that, right? - As a matter of fact, it is. I think in-- - Michelle, don't you know when you're getting played. Dang. - Oh, I'm not thinking about Ashley, I know what she's trying to do. You're trying to get me to say that promiscuous folks like Eadie is going to hell, well I'm not gonna say it, nah-ah, no. - Thank you Michelle. - And you know what? The word also says, that we need to put all of our trust in Him. - [laughs] You know, you kill me with all that Bible bunk. What has it ever done for you, huh? - Oh so now you gonna pick on her? Leave her alone, she ain't done nothing to you. - Why should I? You think you can hide your problems behind all your glories and your hallelujahs? You thought that God was gonna save your precious Troy, but he didn't. He left you for another woman, and he's still out there doing his thing. You know what, you church girls are all alike, just desperate. - That's not what I'm doing. - Michelle, wake up. That's what you did every time you met a man. You thought you could wash away their sins and make them your husband. You know why? Because you thought God wouldn't give you a husband, that's why. - That's not true. I know what God has lined up for me, and it's not about what I have lined up. - I don't know about y'all, but God already got a husband lined up for me. - Yeah I know, downtown in the police lineup next to Freddy. - At least I got a man. - No, honey, you have a facsimile of a man. - What's a facsimile? - It's like having a piece of a man. - Hmm, that sounds interesting. - Girl you are sick. You know what, we need to go into serious fast. - A fast? - Yes, a fast from men. - Are you kidding me, that might work for you church girls, but I can't live without men. - What difference does it make? Men are like toilets at Chene Park. Either they are full of crap, or they're all taken. You know what, Michelle? Maybe you're right. Maybe we have been too dependent on the opposite sex. - That's right. - Maybe a good fast from men might help get them out of our systems. - Oh, you done lost all your marbles. You don't need a man? Girl please, don't be playing me. - Speaking of playing, honey, have you talked to Eddy? - What's Eddy got to do with anything? - Ashley you need to stay out of that. - Stay outta what? - [Ashley] I'm just saying. - Don't be holding out on me. [phone ringing] Matter of fact put a pause on that, I'll handle this in a second. Hello? - [Voiceover] Hey baby, you know, I know we ain't be kicking it a lot lately, but you know, I miss you. - Well speaking of the devil. Ain't seen you in two weeks. Where have you been? - [Voiceover] Oh you know, see, I got this new job, and you know, it's been taking up a lot of my time. - So what you're really trying to say is you found another girl. - [Voiceover] Oh nah-ah, nah-ah baby, it's not even like that. She a friend of the family. - So when we going on this fast? - Oh girl you must be sick. Cause I know this is not my little sister talking. - Yes, who's talking? I should've pinched myself a long time ago. I'm so sick of men. I'm done with brothers. I'ma get me a white man. A Canadian white man. - Totes. - Now how long is this fast? Can we do one of them nine to five like the Baptists? - Girl, any fast for you will help. - Yeah but for how long? Cause there ain't no guaranteeing I can hold out too long. - 40 days. - What? - And nights. - Do I look like Moses? Now hold on Reverend Mother. I need to pray on this one. To the man upstairs. I know you busy holding up the stars and the sky, and all that scientific stuff, but, I need you, I need you now, not another minute, not another second, but I need you now. ♪ I need you now - Okay, so it's settled then? - Don't be telling me off! - You can't sing. - Okay, all right, listen, here are the ground rules, sit down Eadie. No phone calls, no dates, not even praying for a man, and definitely no sex. And Eadie, you just need God in your life. - I got God in my life, hey, [mumbling]. Whoo! - What is that? - [Michelle] Hey Mama what's wrong? - Well, I overheard you girls talking, and, I'm having second thoughts about Reverend Buckworth. - Well you might as well join us on our fast. - How long y'all fasting for? - 40 days. - Ain't you sure about them nights? - Girl... - Now Mama, why you having second thoughts? I thought you really liked the reverend? - That I did too. But I don't know what it is, it's just something about him, I can't quite put my finger on him. - Seriously? - [Jackie] Ashley. - You're right. I'm sorry Mama. - Mama? - Do whatever you wanna do. - Listen, we all want you to know, that we really love you. - Seriously? [laughing] [funky music] [sighs] - Look guys, I 'm starting to get a few headaches. I think I need a drink. - You just need some prayer, that's all. - Michelle can't you see nothing is wrong with Eadie, she's just aroused. I mean what were we thinking? Maybe we should throw in the towel, cause this fast is killing me. - Oh God, he's good! Girls, I have exciting news. - What are you so excited about Mama? - Y'all remember I told you I had an uncle in the furniture business? Down in North Carolina? - [Girls] Yeah? - Well, he never got married, and all of his family is gone, in fact, his only sister died two years ago, and she didn't have any children either. Anyway, to make a long story short, he died two weeks ago, and they read his will last week. And I got this certified letter today. - And so that means that? - Dang girl, for a person who is supposed to be so smart, you sure are stupid, maybe you got your degree from eBay too? - Anyway. He's gone now. And he left all of his money to his only surviving relative. And guess what girls. - [Girls] What? - It's me! [gasps] - You mean we're getting paid? - We're getting paid. [screaming] - We're getting paid, no money, no friends, some money, everybody your friend. - Oh my God, I knew God would bless us, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. - [Eadie] How much Mama, how much? - $2,000,000. [cheering] - I'm buying everything, I saw this bag that I want! [incoherent chattering] [funky music] [laughing] - Money, money, money, money, money! I say! I haven't had this much fun in years. I could do this, every day! - Hmm-mm, me too! But isn't it nice to have money in your pocket? But is it better than having a man, Eadie? - Uh, I'll let you know in a couple of days. Thanks to Mama, I'ma take some of this money and probably go on a cruise, maybe to Alaska, and lay out on the beach. - Girl, shut up. What are you talking about? - Well it's about time that Mama did something for us, you know she owes us, right? - Ah, Eadie, you better lay off that stuff. The Bible says, be not drunk with excess of wine. - What does it say about vodka? - Girl. Help her, Jesus. [laughing] - See, I like, that 's a good look. - [All] Woo! - Look at her piece right here, don't she look good? Don't she look good? - Now look at my sister! - Well, you now, we went and got our hair did. - Auntie, you look gorgeous. - I told her that blond works for her. [incoherent chattering] [laughing] - [All] Oh Lord! - Who let the dogs out? - [All] Who, who, who, who, who? - Hi, I'm Roger. I'm here to install the new cable system? I understand a Reverend James Buckworth has already paid for everything? - Buckworth? - He got the premium package, the works. - That's my friend. Yeah, that was so nice of him. Well come on in Roger, and I'll show you how uh, everything works. - Okay. - Now that's all right, you work the dough, come on here Daddy, Momma got you. - How you doing? So look, I'm just gonna help myself into the other room, I live right upstairs so I'm familiar how all the units are laid out. - Are you sure you're name isn't Justin Ladinmore? The football player? Didn't I meet you at the club the other night? - Uhm, excuse me. I would imagine that the positive polar ends connecting to the negative molecular stratagems would allow for a positive transmission to the fiber optics. But then again I guess that would be an arduous task, wouldn't it? [laughs] ♪ God is a good God - Boy you so fine. I mean, ahem, God is good. All the time! - [Willia Mae] Amen. - Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. - Well uh... - Oh Jesus. - Nice meeting all of you. - [Michelle] Yes Lord. - I'm just going to... Add a couple things, you know. [girls whimpering] Reconnect a couple of things, all right, it won't take long. [girls whimpering] - Hmm, Jesus, I need to lay hands on him. - Girls! Now I thought we were supposed to be fasting from men, and I do believe that was a man that just walked in there. Now we do need to give thanks to the Creator, cause he has blessed us all. - Yes he has. - Michelle, Michelle?! - Yes Mother? - [Jackie] Come on and lead us in prayer. - Uh, why you ain't ask me? I ain't no heathen. - Okay baby, come on, Eadie lead us in prayer. - Cool. - Then I know we're going to hell. - To the man upstairs. - His Lord. - Wassup? I've been chilling with these y'all peoples for a long time, it's cool that you brought us together, and we just wanna thank you for the chips, oh and lead me not into temptation, cause I can find it myself. We'll kick it with you later. Deuces. - [Group] Amen. - Amen. That was good baby. Well come on Willia Mae, let's go shopping. Spending some of this money. [phone ringing] - Yeah, I can't do it, okay, okay, bye. - Wow Eadie's prayer must've affected you cause I ain't never seen you speak in tongue before. - Girl, I wasn't speaking no tongues, I ain't have but five minutes left on my cellphone. - You know what, now that we got some money, we gonna get you a phone when we go get me some shoes too. - All right, cause this money ain't gonna spend itself. - Oh right, you got that right. - Just think, we got 200,000 a piece to spend on whatever we want and there's plenty more in the bank for backup. - Hmm-mm. - Now you're finally beginning to understand the value of money. - Girl please, I understood it when I come borrow 10 dollars for your broke behind. - Well just think about all of those poor people in Africa, I mean, think how they must feel, they don't have anything. Think about that, Eadie. - You know what your problem is, Michelle? You need a man to show you what you've been missing. - Whatever. - All right ladies, I'm just about done. But uh, I need to go downstairs and flip the switch on the main board. - Okay, just do what you do, hmm. Yeah girl you be missing it. - So what am I missing, Eadie? Some hot sweaty man breathing all down my neck? - Hmm. - Licking and sucking all over my ears. - Ohh... - Unbuttoning my blouse like he got a search warrant or something. Talking about how much he loved me. - Oh girl keep going. - Girl, you need help. - No girl, Mama don't need help. You just missing it. - I don't think so. Are you so quick to forget what a man did to you? Move girl. What a man did to Mama, and what a man did to Ashley? If you wanna know if your man is the real deal, you need to be willing to make him wait. Make him sweat a little. Make him want you more than anything in this world. Make him get down on his knees. - Oh, there you go again, girl you need to stop. - Girl please. - [Ashley] Eadie you need to dip your head in a bucket of bleach. - Hmm... [door knocking] - All right ladies. I just wanted to let you know. You're all set. And I put two new cable boxes and two new remotes in the back. - And you have two beautiful eyes. You wanna come to a party this weekend? - [Ashley] Eadie, it's Mama's party. Remember? - Eadie, come here. Eadie, come here! - Excuse us. - [Michelle] Are you forgetting something? - I know, I know, we're still fasting, but at least we can look at him! I mean we need somebody cute at the party. - Eadie's right. I mean we're not trying to become nuns. I mean we're just breaking our dependency on men. - All right. - Okay, so it's settled. Uhm, hey Roger? Yeah so uhm, would you like to come to our party? - Uh, excuse me Miss Independent, do we have a parakeet in the room? Didn't I just ask him? So you coming? - Sure, I'd love to come. Thanks for invitation. And actually since I live upstairs, we'll all be seeing a lot of each other. - [Eadie] Is that so? - [Ashley] Amen. - So can I get you to sign here? - Oh no, I'll sign that, she can't spell. So, all right, there you go. - All right. - Okay. - Perfect. Well, enjoy. - We will. - See you soon. - Ta-ta. - All right now. - Thank you Jesus, hallelujah! Oh! - So now you wanna be saved? Girl, bye. - Yes sir, things were looking pretty dark before. What's that scripture? God always has a Sam in the bush Woo! Thank you Jesus. - You need help. - She's a mess.

Come on in. - Now you sure you're daughters are not gonna jump down my throat again are you? - No, come on in, I know they was a bit tough on you last time. - I must say your house really looks nice, Sister Jackie. - Thank you. - You know I've been praying for y'all. - Well it's a funny thing you say that, because, the Lord has truly blessed us. - Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, the Lord is good isn't he? - All the time. Reverend? - [Rev. Buckworth] Yes sister? - Listen, I wanted to give you a little something. - [Rev. Buckworth] Okay. - You know, as a peace offering to show you how sorry I am. - Well you know I ain't bring no condoms. - What? - I'm just kidding. [laughing] - Sit down. This is for you. - Oh Sister Jackie. Oh my goodness, gracious. Sister Jackie! This is, this is a real Rolex. - And you deserve it, it's just a little something. - I would say it is. [laughing] And you're so fine. - Reverend, we're gonna have a party here this weekend. - [Rev. Buckworth] Okay. - At the house. You should come on by. - I sure will. - [Jackie] All right. - Wouldn't miss it for the world. - [Jackie] All right. - I don't plan to ever let you out my sights again. - Well, amen. - Praise the Lord. Sister, I must say, Sister Jackie, you have the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen. - Oh, God is good. - Oh, I got a preacher funeral. You remember Miss Dawson, the little midget lady who had the big old water head? - [Jackie] Yeah, I remember. - Well she passed. - Oh that's too bad. - Yes. - Well, you take care now. See you this weekend. - Thank you for the invite. - Don't forget the party! - Praise the Lord! - [Jackie] All right, God is good. All right. - [Rev. Buckworth] Thank for you for the watch, Sister Jackie. - All right. Hmm... [funky music] - Well I hope Mama's happy. But I don't know how much longer I can stand this, the music is whack, ain't no real men in here. Not even a dog. - Dang girl, just hold on. We only got a few more weeks or so. - Yeah, and in a few more weeks I'll be dried up like the Red Sea. - Well you look like the Red Sea. - Oh, excuse me, mouth. - Hey Auntie. [calming music] [door knocking] - Oh, that must be my date. Booya! - [Ashley] A date? - Yeah, you know, I still work it. It's okay, it's okay now! Let me get some of these. - Willia Mae, will you leave him alone, he ain't thinking about you. Come on in, the girls must have you invited you. - Yes they did. - Oh, welcome to my party. - Thank you. - Can I get you something? - Ah... - Oh, would you like a little bit of my homemade upside down pineapple cake? - Don't eat that. The puppy died. - She's just playing. - No, I'm not. - [Jackie] Uhm, would you like a slice? - Uh, I'll pass on the cake, I'll take something to drink. - Oh, okay. - Excuse me Mama. Oh honey, you need something to wet your whiskers? Come with me. - I'll take it from here, Eadie. Right this way. Would you like to try some of my, sandwiches? I call them my miracle sandwiches. - Uhm, now, excuse me. But he looks like the type of man that would rather something like, caviar or lobster, you know, something with a little taste to it. Not those little, plain little tuna sandwiches. Come on. - You're such a hater. - Wow. Yeah, thanks for bailing me out, I was getting a little nervous. - Well why would you feel apprehensive? I mean, there's nothing insidious going on here. I mean we're all quite innocuous. [laughing] - Well, normally I don't, but I just didn't wanna perceived as a player. You know? I mean it... It's a travesty how, how brothers behave so immaturely and, and treat our beautiful sisters so ignominiously. - Hmm! - You know? You know what's funny? - What? - You make this party worth coming to. - Really? - Yeah. There's something uh, magnetic about you. I feel so, so placid, so... - Hmm! - Imperturbable. - Oh. Sweetie you don't sound like a cable guy to me. - What, you thought I just fixed television sets and I don't know, strain cable wire? - Well, sort of, I mean isn't that what you do? - Well that's only what I do part time. - Oh. - Actually I just got my doctorate in communications, and my family is funding my new communications company. As soon as they liquidate some stock. - Oh. - Hope I didn't present myself in an ambiguous way. - Oh no. Not at all. - Well you know what, I should uh, I should be getting back to the party. I don't wanna take up too much of your time. - Oh, okay. - But uh... You look beautiful. So I should let some of these other wonderful people absorb your company. - Thank you. - Au revoir. - Au revoir! Oh my gosh! A real man. A brother with a plan that knows how to say more than just "Wassup". Not to mention his family has money, oh! And let's face it, that man is fine. Hmm! [humming] - Praise the Lord. Aren't you Michelle? - Praise the Lord, I am. - How you doing? - I'm good, thank you. - You know, you're so much different than your sisters. There's something really spiritual about you. - You think so huh? - I mean, I might be wrong, but, I feel like we were supposed to meet. - Amen. - All things work out good for those who love the Lord. - Oh so you're saved? - Saved? - Uhuh? - Oh yeah, saved, I've been saved for, well about 15 years now. - Oh... 15 years? - Hmm-mm. - Hmm! - For God so loved the world that he gave... - Uh, you were saying? - Right, for God so loved the world. - Hmm-mm? - Bow your head. For God so loved the world that he gave... - [Michelle] He gave... - He gave his... You know what? - Huh? - We should talk about this some other time. I don't wanna get too heavy here. - Oh, oh, glory! - You feel that? - I feel it! - You feel that? - I feel it, praise the Lord. - Michelle. - Huh? - Michelle I... I feel like Elijah. I'm out here all alone. - All alone. - I just need somebody to, I don't know, just, somebody who understands my pain, someone who, can sympathize with what I'm going through. - Oh... - Someone who... Is dealing with the same temptations I'm dealing with. - Yes, yes. - But you know what, I shouldn't, I shouldn't pour all this out on you right now. - Okay. Yeah, that's not good. - I'm sorry. - Okay. - So I'm gonna get back to the party. - Okay, praise the Lord. - Okay? - Okay. - One quick prayer? May the grace of God, and the... Sweet aroma of the Holy Ghost, rest, rule, and abide with you. Shalom. - Hmm, hmm! Lord. Could this be my husband? Now God I know you called me to be a missionary, and I'm supposed to be about your work. But, Roger... Hmm! Now that's a good place to start. Thank you Jesus. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. - What's up Mama? - What's up with you, Daddy? - I mean I was standing back there, I was looking at you the last few minutes, and I was like, she is fine! Straight up marriage material! - You knew all of that just by looking at me for a few minutes? - What? Put it this way. ♪ Let your hair down - You must be a songwriter. - I mean, you know, producer. Actually me and my man SamX, we got a little record label, BlazeMe Records. - Oh! - Phew, fire! We're actually looking for a new artist. Yeah, what, you sing? - A little. - Hell yeah? Get outta here.

Glad you're not like one of them lil' holier than thou girls, or one of them lil' gold diggers. - Well then you don't wanna get mixed up with my sisters, then. - Guess not. Look. Hope I didn't come on too strong, I was, just blown away by, you know, you just being a real sister. So I'ma get back to this party and go highlight a couple of other people. But I'ma see you around, right? A'ight. - He ain't nothing like Eddy or any of them other dorks I've been messing with. Oh shoot. But what about the agreement? This brother's too good to let go. [funky music] [laughing] I see you finally decided to let go and let God. - Well it is good to have a balanced life, girl. Even David danced outta his clothes. Hey! [door knocking] - Oh baby get that for me? - Okay. - [Rev. Buckworth] Hey. - Rev. Duckworth. - It's Buckworth, with a capital B. You keep messing my name up, and I-- - Revered Buckworth! - Hey Sister Jackie! - I didn't think you was coming. - I wouldn't miss this special occasion, demons from hell couldn't keep me from being here. - I'm glad to hear that. Well join the party, make yourself at home. - Thank you Ms. Jackie. - Mom. - [Jackie] What? - I thought you said you were having second thoughts about the rev. - Well, baby I thought it over and at first it seemed like he was trying to use me, but, it turns out I was wrong. - You didn't tell him about the money, did you? - Well not exactly. See, I told him that we was blessed unexpectedly, and you know baby, he been so kind to me. And y'all been so mean to him. So to make it up to him, I got him a little gift, nothing big, you know, just a Rolex. - A Rolex, Mother? Oh. - Ms. Jackie, I must say this is a really nice party you have going on here. - Oh thank you reverend, let me introduce you to some of the other men here. - Okay. - All right.

Uh, you have sent a lot of customers over to our company. - Ah, that would be me. The cable company, okay yeah. - That's right, right, right. - Now Roger is such a Biblical sounding name. - Oh really? - Yeah, uh, sister, we need to talk scripture. Listen, let me get me a second to talk scripture with Brother Roger. - Oh sure, you go right ahead and talk. Girls, y'all come on over here, let's get this party started now! [cheering] - Praise the Lord. Break it down. - Right, right, left, uh, break it down, break it down! - Praise God. All right, hmm-mm-mm, whoo. - That's right, phenomenal woman, she is, damn. - Listen, listen. - What's going on? - Stop that! - Man, I was gonna pray for you! - Stop praying for me, stupid. Listen, what the hell is this with the Biblical name? Roger ain't no Biblical name. - Man it just sounds good man, that's what pastors say. - Okay, well stop, you know what I'm saying? This pastor stuff is fake anyway. - Well how you coming with everything? - Look, I'm coming along but, this is hard work man, yes it's tough, cause they're so different. - Hey, praise the Lord sister-- - Move it. - We gotta watch her, she might be on to us. But look. It's a challenge because they're all really smart, well at least two outta the three. But uh, I don't know, this might take me more than just a few days, this might take me a few weeks. - A few weeks? Man I ain't got no damn few weeks man. Man, that's why I hired you, you told me, you was a player. You need to be in the gym, working on them muscles, you need to work on your game, baby. Look man, I got a mortgage due, I got a car loan due, I got a girlfriend, a wife, and a baby mama. Man, you need to wrap this thing up man, I need you to get you to scoop on all them girls, man. Don't blow this thing, man. Or there's no way it'll work. - I'm actually doing pretty well, I think. But I don't know about you, "Rev". - Whatever. - What about you, how are you doing huh? I don't know how well this pastor thing is working. You almost blew everything when you broke up with the mama. - Well she wanted to get married man. - Oh come on. - I can't marry fool, I'm already married. - Oh that's right. - That's a felony. - But, but if you marry her anyway, won't you, you'll get all the money? - I didn't know about the money then. - You're right. - How we gonna handle this thing man? We need to make this thing happen. - Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, now listen, listen. Just keep telling her what she wants to hear, all right? - Yeah. - She's a beautiful woman, but just keep complementing her on how good she looks, and how much she been losing weight, right? - Right. - You know, tell her, she been glowing, she got a glow about it, they love that kind of stuff. - Now, now, now fellas. You must not keep the ladies waiting. - Ms. Jackie. - It's just a little man-talk. - And you are right about that Ms. Jackie. Nice to meet you, Robert. - Yes sir. Thank you for sharing that scripture with me. - Yes, Ms. Jackie. - Hmm, amen. - I must say that your figure, looks really wonderful, you've been losing weight in the gym. - Yes I have. - And if you keep, oh lord, you got a great future behind you too, girl. [laughing] Listen, if you keep this up, I'm gonna have to fight to keep those wolves off of you! [roars] [laughing] - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Can I ask you a question? - What? - Is this the party? - Yes it is, reverend. - Well let's go get our boogie home. - All right. [squawking] Show me what you're working with, right, uh, right, uh, right, yeah! [funky music] - You know, Roger. These last few weeks have been great. You seem to have managed to get me to let down my guard. No one does that. You know? I can't wait for this absurd fast to be over. Ugh. It's killing me. - I know, me too. You remember when I told you, my family was gonna monetarily facilitate my communications company? - Yeah, I remember. - Well. It's not gonna happen now. - Oh? - Stock market went south and, it's gonna probably delay my plans for like at least another couple of years. You know, worst part about it? - What? - I've already got $500,000 worth of clients already set up. - So what's the problem? - I'm gonna have to raise like $35,000 for licensing and equipment. Just crazy. - Can I help? - No. Nah, I mean, I couldn't ask you for any money, that would just be unconscionable. But thanks for being so sweet and considerate. - Well you know it's not like you're taking it from me. I'm giving it to you. And if it's makes you feel any better, babe, you can give it me back to me, when you start making money. Just give me a few days. I just have to move a couple things around in the bank. But. I have it handled. And not a word to my sisters. - Not a word. [funky music] [door knocking] - Hey. - [Roger] Hey Michelle. - Hey honey how are you? - Good, good. How you doing? - I'm good. - [Roger] You look great. - Oh well thank you. - Praise God. What's wrong with your voice, you've been shouting all day in church or something? - Boy, church was good, I nearly shouted my vocal cords out the door. - I heard that, praise God. - And speaking of church. Ahem, where have you been? You haven't been to Bible Study in three weeks. - Well... I know, but to be honest with you, Michelle I just, I just haven't been feeling real comfortable about myself, you know? I know people in church are always looking good and all the brothers always dress sharp, and, you know, my clothing game is kinda suspect, you know, I wouldn't wanna be there and embarrassing you or myself. But you know what, I believe, God for uncommon favor. But what would really help is if I had like my own line of credit, then I could just get what I need, when I needed it. I mean doesn't the word say, that I should be the first, and not the last? The head, and not the tail. The lender, and... Oh hallelujah! Oh, oh! - Yes, yes Lord. - Can you feel that, Michelle? - I feel it. I feel it. - I feel the Lord, and I'm in his presence right now. - Yes, you know, what am I thinking about? You know I have a credit line of $50,000 on my Visa credit card, you can have it. And get whatever you need. - No, what! - Yeah, yeah. - Oh Michelle... I, no, I don't know, I... - It's yours. - I couldn't do that, I know you need that. - Listen. The Bible says, that God is love right? - Yeah. - Well. Love won't let me wait. Because you know why? My tomorrow, might very well be today. - Hmm. [funky music] Here's your wine, baby. - Thank you. - You know? These last few weeks have been the best days of my life. - Oh! You always say the sweetest things. Especially for a producer. - Oh, thank you baby. Well, you know, speaking of producer, me and my partner was talking the other day, and, well you know, we're trying to figure out who we want to be the first artist on our new label. And I told him about you. - You did what? - Yep, told him how beautiful you were, told him how beautiful a voice you have, and we should consider our first artist, being you. - And what did he say? - Well you know. He said it was my call. - And what did you say? - Come on now baby. What you think I said? [moaning] Oh but you know what baby, no, you can't get too excited. Because, the studio still needs some major renovations, you know, so we ain't got to outsource everything. - So how long can that take? - I don't know. But it might take a while. You know, we only need about like, $40,000 or something like that, you know, not much, but, I ain't tripping, I got it covered. And then, I'ma see my baby's face on the cover of a new CD. I already scheduled your photo shoot. - Well maybe I can help with the revelations. - Uh you know what? It's really nothing you can really help with, you know it's gonna take a lot of muscle. - I wasn't talking about muscle. - [laughs] Well what were you talking about then? - I'm talking about money. - Money? What about money? - I've got a little saved up that I could use. - What you? Nah! Nah, nah, nah, nah. You can forget about that, squash that. - Why, cause I'm a woman? - I'm saying baby, I can't take no money from you. We've only known each other for a few weeks. - And they been the best few weeks of my life. Anyway, I wanna help. I'm gonna be the next Mary J. Blige. - But baby I'm talking about $40,000. Not $4,000. - I got this. - You do? You gonna help me with that kinda money? I mean you gonna, you gonna help, your man, do his thing? - Yeah, just gimme a couple days, I gotta move some stuff around.
