(man) What's happened here? Martha and Carl Brodie, mother and son. No one's seen them since Tuesday. The car is a Trans Am, blue with yellow pinstriping. California license: 2CLG592. No one's seen that since Tuesday, either. God, I just hope nothing horrible happened to them. They were so close! Ma'am, please, step back. Sheriff, what do you think happened? I don't know, but somebody sure doesn't like cats. (flies buzzing) (quiet chattering) Shit! Looks like the place has been empty for a hundred years. Well, it hasn't.

(sighs) I'm very embarrassed. Am I blushing? You look good in red, Tanya. How'd you know my name? English, period four, Creative Writing. Mr. Fallows, the weird and terrible. Oh, you're the new guy. From Ohio? Paradise Falls. Popcorn. Go ahead. You mean free? - Shhh. (mutters) - (chuckles) Thanks. I don't suppose you'd like a ride home after work tonight, would you? My dad picks me up. - Nice dad. - Yeah. Besides, what would your girlfriend say if you gave the popcorn girl a ride? No girlfriend. I'm new in town, remember? Thanks. I'll see you in class. Oh, wait! Welcome to Travis. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Oh, my God! - (gasps) - Hi! I'm okay. How's my girl? I'm good, Dad. Good. Fasten your seat belt. (engine starts) Tanya. (bell tolling) ♪♪ (whistling) It's my son, officer. - Cat? - (cat screeches) Having himself one hissy fit, I'll tell you. I'm sorry, officer. It's late, but this allergy is so severe. Yeah, I know. I got one too. Mine's to the I.R.S. Y'all have a good night. - Thank you, officer. - (cat meows) It just ignored the trap. It was right by the window. - (engine starts) - It's okay. It's gone now. I'll set some more traps in the morning. Did you bring me anything? Anything special in mind? Am I beautiful? You're always beautiful, Mother. So, did you ask this mystery girl out? What kind of a girl would go out with a guy she just met? - Not a very nice one, I suppose. - (cat meows) - Another one? - Goddamn cats. Don't swear, Mother. Just you make sure you ask her out tomorrow. What's her name? Tanya Robertson. Is she nice? She's nice. I'm sure of it. She's pure. Good. (gasping) I'm famished, Charles. Famished! (Charles reading) " They were sleepwalkers, hiding in human robes. Feeding on virtue. Loving to feed, feeding to breed. So, in the end, they ran. In the end, Robbie and his mother always had to run. For one night, the men would come in their old cars... men with lights and guns. And to the boy and his mother... their curses and their screams of rage always sound the same. Like the laughter of cruel gods. The time of happiness... too brief to be anything but golden, had run out." Very good, Charles. Very good. Your teachers in Ohio must have been sorry to lose such a creative young man. I beg your pardon, Mr. Fallows? Isn't that where you transferred from? Ohio? Oh, yes. Yes, it is. Hey. Shit! I suggest that next time you keep your hands to yourself, Mr. Crawford. Yes, sir. (scoffs) (murmurs) Asshole. (Fallows) All right, any thoughts on Mr. Brady's Sleepwalkers? Miss Robertson? I liked it. - You liked it? - (students laughing) It was different. I thought it was very sad. (Fallows) Sad? Why? Because they were always driven away. Because they were such outsiders. (Fallows) I think Miss Robertson might be on to something. Now, we all understand that a story... has to have a beginning, a middle and an end, right? But that's like saying a box has four sides. Actually, Mr. Fallows, a box has six sides. - (students laughing) - Busted! (bell ringing) (girls chattering) You've actually talked to him? Yeah, he's nice. Real nice. - I'm serious! - I can see that. Well, what happened? Did he ask you out or anything? Nothing specific, just a maybe. We just talked at the theater. That's all you would've done anyway. What a waste! Well, excuse me, but what would you have done? - Everything. - (laughs) - Everything! - (laughing) Well, I may have plans of my own... and they just might include Homeland. Yeah, right. I can just see you in the back seat at Homeland. You guys! Tanya, you gotta admit, your dad's gonna be there. - I can just see it. - My dad's not gonna be there. - (laughing) Hi. Charles, hi. Charles, do you know Jeanette and Carrie? This is Charles Brady. - Hi. - We are in the same class, Tanya. Oh. Can I give you a ride home? I mean, all of you? No, we've got a ride. But why don't you go, Tanya? Okay, see you later. (sighs) I also wanted to thank you. For what? For what you said in class. I mean, you really nailed it. (laughs) No, you did, so thank you. I think I know how they feel, the... What are they called? - Sleepwalkers. - Sleepwalkers. At least sometimes I feel that different. (boy) Look! - Madam. - This yours? - Do you like it? - Yeah. Whoa! You know, some people use a door. - Really? - Yes. - I heard that somewhere. - Did you? (Tanya) Mom? Mom? She must be shopping or something. Let's go upstairs. Okay. - Thanks for the ride home. - Anytime. Oh, wow! These are interesting. My mom does gravestone rubbings. Pretty morbid, huh? - No, I like 'em. - You do? Yeah. (laughs) My room. Oh, you have a lot of pictures. Yeah, it's kind of a hobby. Oh, these are great! Really nice. - Makes you want to... - What? Oh! Just really get a good look at these kind of places. You know, things that we never really see. My favorite picture's over there. Which one? (exhales) Um.... That one. I like rocks. (laughs) You do? You know, I'd really like to see how you see a photograph before you take it... I mean, you don't even know me, but... Well, actually, I was gonna shoot at Homeland tomorrow if... - Well, if you want to come. - What's Homeland? - Oh, it's... it's an old graveyard. - Really? - Yeah, it's neat. - I love old graveyards. - Sweetheart... - Mom! I'm sorry, dear. I didn't know you had company. This is Charles Brady. This is my mom. He gave me a ride home. - Oh, that's nice. - (chuckles) - Charles. - Very nice to meet you. Likewise. Well, we should go. (chuckles) We were just going. So we'll do that tomorrow? - Yes. - Okay. - I'll walk you out. - Okay. So you two are going out tomorrow? Yes. Tanya's gonna show me... Homeland. Oh, really? You see, I do rubbings too. Not quite as fine as yours... but I figure there must be some old slate gravestones out there. Yes, as a matter of fact... in the old section near the woods. Tell me, Charles, do you use powder or stick? I use stick. Usually a number five. Really? Don't you find that a little hard? Yeah, but, I'm clumsy. You know, powder's so messy. - (laughs) Tell me, Charles, where do you live? - 66 Wicker Street. - Your father, what does he do? - He's dead, Mrs. Robertson. - Oh, I'm sorry. - It was a long time ago. Well, the Brands will be coming to dinner tomorrow night. So be back by 5:00, okay? - Okay. - She will be. How'd you know all that stuff? I learned it a long time ago, from my mom. - See you tomorrow. - Okay.

Reminds you of Ohio, I suppose? Yeah, well, you know... No, actually, I don't, Charles. I don't know. And you don't, either. There is no Paradise Falls in Ohio. Your transcripts are also fakes. Clever fakes, but fakes. Anything to say? - You're mistaken. - Oh, no, I'm not. But you are, Charles, if you think you can wiggle out of this. I don't know who you are, but I know you're not who you say you are. If this is blackmail, Mr. Fallows, I think you've picked the wrong guy. This car is the only expensive thing I've got.
