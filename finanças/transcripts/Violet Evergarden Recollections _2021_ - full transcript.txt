Hm. What's the matter? It's your eyes. It's the same color as your eyes. The way I felt when I saw this… This feeling… What is it called? "Major Gilbert. I've been in the hospital for 120 days now. My strength has almost recovered. Movement is still a little difficult but I can perform my duties. Please let me return to my post soon." KINGDOM OF ENCIEL SOMEWHERE IN THE CAPITAL OF ENCHAINE Her existence had been kept hidden from everyone. However, some of the people who knew about her said that she was a weapon. She would fight if you ordered her to. She just looked like a human. She was just a tool… without a heart. Lieutenant Hodgins? This way. Uh? Oh. Yeah. Sorry. Violet! Are you okay? Are you hurt? The major? Where's Major Gilbert? He's, uh, not here. Where is he? Did he return home already? How are his injuries doing anyway? I know they were pretty severe. Tell me. Is the major actually… alive? Well, he's… You're being discharged from the hospital. Lieutenant Hodgins came all this way to pick you up, you know. Uh, yeah, that's right. Excuse me. Lieutenant Hodgins. Violet. Relax. I had forgotten that you were a Lieutenant. -I apologize, sir. -It's okay. Here. Sit down. Anyway… I was wondering if you actually remember me. Yes. We have met twice before. During the training and the night before the battle. Yeah. You are right. What were you doing? I was writing a report to Major Gilbert. They said that writing words down would help to improve my condition a great deal. So, how is the major? Don't worry, Violet. He's the one who asked me to come here for you. So then, that means that he's fine. The doctor told me that we won the war. What post is he assigned to now? When will I be able to join him? First, get changed. I'll have them send the car in the meantime. These finally arrived. These are your belongings. It looks like they delivered it to an army base far away by mistake. The brooch. Huh? Where is the emerald brooch? Huh? This is everything there was from the garrison in the place where they found you. If it's not here, I have to look for it. Violet! Someone gave it to me. The major gave it to me! I understand. I'll be sure to look for it. Don't worry. -Yes, but-- -Anyway… You come along with me now. Those are his direct orders. Orders? I understand. Lieutenant? When am I going to receive my next orders from the major? It's just that in my current condition, the duties I'm capable of performing are limited. Violet. I brought you a gift. I didn't really know what you'd like, so I bought three. What do you think? I don't need them. Uh… No. You have to choose one. So pretend that the world is about to end, okay? Three, two… Then, the puppy. Here. Why did you choose the puppy? Because the major's brother once told me, "You're actually just like Gilbert's dog." Looks like it's gonna be a long journey. The train tracks around here were damaged during the bombing and aren't usable anymore. Have you ever been to Leiden before? No. Gilbert was thinking all along about what your future would hold after the war. That's why he was saying that he wants to leave you with the folks at the Evergarden household, his most trusted relatives. I contacted them earlier, and they'd be more than happy to take you in. I'm taking you there to meet them now. Thank you for coming. This is Violet. And this is the lady of the Evergarden household. You can say hello. Oh, a bow would be good enough. Doesn't it take around three days from Enchaine now? Yes. Normally, I'd be able to return in one day. But the war went on for four years. It's going to take some more time to restore everything. Well, Violet dear. Please, have a drink. I'm sorry! Don't force yourself! Oh, no! You'll get burned. It's not a problem. I'm not able to feel the heat. But your bandages… We have to cool them down quickly. Oliver, bring some ice! Yes, madam. These arms are made of adamant silver. They're a bit clumsy, but they're sturdy. I'm not used to them yet. Someday, I'll be able to use them with no problem, though. Can you come this way for a minute? I used these gloves when I was younger. Those are quite nice. Try them on. Yeah. They look good on you. They do. Well, I'm going to get going now. I have to get back to the office. Oh. Violet. Be sure to listen closely to Tiffany. It's okay. You don't have to worry about us at all. Think of me as your real mother, dear. You can tell me anything. Okay? Yes, but I… don't have any parents, so I don't need replacements. Don't say that, dear. I had a son, but he was killed in the war. I can't become a replacement for your lost child. I, uh… Okay, listen, Violet. It's Gilbert's wish for you to live happily here. So… do you understand? The major! Major Gilbert. Why is he leaving me here? Is it because I lost my arms, and lost my value as a weapon? If I just trained a little, I'd still be able to fight! Violet, you know that… Well, you know the war is over. I am the major's tool. But if he doesn't need me anymore, then I should be discarded. Please do it. Please discard me somewhere. Lieutenant Hodgins. Oh, I forgot to tell you. I left the army. I'm not a Lieutenant anymore. Then what should I call you? Call me "President." This is my company. I bought an old house and renovated it a bit. The first floor has the reception desk. All right, sir. If I could ask you to please write down the receiver's and sender's addresses on this form here. And we ask you to please allow at least three days for it to be delivered. The second floor houses the office and the writing department. -Writing? -Yes. This department writes letters at the requests of our clients. There are still many people who don't know how to write. I didn't know how to write either until the major taught me how. I see. I was thinking about starting a business once the war ended. The government's postal service doesn't address the needs of civilians, so, I thought it would be a good opportunity. Now, here's your orders… Violet Evergarden. The fact is, that Gilbert left you in my care. So, I'm going to give you orders in his place. You're still very useful, Violet. You can work. Right here. Benedict. Yeah, what's up, President? You're supposed to say "How can I help you, President?" So, what's up? Ow! Why'd you do that? You didn't listen to me. This is Benedict. He's a postman here. He's an old friend from before I started this company. And, Benedict, let me introduce you to Violet. She'll be a postman. Starting today. She's just a little kid. She's highly capable of performing her duties. I'm going to go to the bank for a bit. Teach her what she needs to know. Put your stuff in here. Yes, sir. Your uniform. -Put it on. -Yes, of course, sir. Sort them just like it says here. Then put them in those shelves over there. There's a huge pile of mail, but you don't have to rush. And the break room is on the second floor. I understand, sir. See you. Sir. I've almost completed my duties. Were you working the whole time? Without taking a break? I'm used to long operations. So, uh, you maybe want to try delivering the mail? Delivering? You deliver the letter to the address that's written on it. Anyway, I'm going to go home now. See you tomorrow. Violet! What are you doing? Delivering the mail. Uh, I meant you can deliver the mail tomorrow. And make sure to take breaks during work. You just got out of the hospital after all. It's not a problem. All right, you know what? It is a problem. Now listen, Violet. Go ahead and eat. Yes, sir. You can return to the office after you eat. We only have space in the attic, but you can sleep there. Uh, the Evergardens have agreed to take you in and have you live with them until you become an adult. But it looks like leaving you at the mansion… Yeah, that's a problem. -Ow! -Hey! I was trying to put it nicely! How was I supposed to know? Well, see you tomorrow. I'll walk you. So, what was the last order you received from Gilbert? He said, "You have to live and be free." And, I, uh… You've been in the army ever since you were a child. You've spent your life fulfilling your duties. However, you're going to learn many things in the future. Although, it might be easier to keep living if you never learn them. You see, you don't realize yet, but your body is on fire and burning up because of the things you did. I'm not burning. Yes, you are. I'm not burning. -I don't get it. -No. You are burning. I saw you like that, and left you alone. That's why when Gilbert left you with me, it was my chance for redemption. Someday, you'll understand what I said. And then you'll realize for the first time that you have many burns. Uh, Ms. Doll? Uh, no, my name is Violet. Well, in that case, Miss Violet, can I get you to write something for me? Write for… "You were the first person… …the first person who was kind to me. I appreciated it. You were everything to me. I would have done anything for you. Anything at all." Go! "I want to know how you feel. I want to understand what's in your heart. Even though we're apart now… I love you." We'll end with that. Okay? What do you think? Great! "I love you." Please drop by at the reception desk on the first floor for delivery. Sir. All of us here at the Auto Memories Doll Service… wish to thank you for coming in today. So, who are you? I don't understand how you knew. Huh? How did you know that the man just now… wanted to say "I love you"? Do you want to work as an Auto Memories Doll? Yes. It's still hard for me to hold a pen. But I can operate a typewriter. No, that's not what I mean. I wanted to ask you why. I just want to know! "I love you." What does it mean? The major said those words to me after he gave me my last orders. That was the first time I heard those words from the major. I just don't understand what that really means. So, I thought this might… help me learn. Normally, people become Auto Memories Dolls because they do understand that. But… It's okay. She had always just followed Gilbert's orders in the past. That was the first time she asserted her own will. Everyone said she didn't have a heart but she said, "I want to know what 'I love you' means." No way! There's no way I'm going to let you die! Stop it. Stop it already! Enough. Now, Violet, listen. You have to live… and be free. I mean it. I love you. I LOVE YOU AND THE AUTO MEMORY DOLL FOUR YEARS AGO Hey. Get up. I found her in the northeastern war zone. Her name is… Violet Evergarden. She's going to work as an apprentice Auto Memories Doll starting today. Please teach her whatever you can about the job. Okay. Um, first off… Hmm. How much do you know about what Auto Memories Dolls do? I know that they write letters at the request of other people. Lieutenant Hodgins… I mean, the president told me so. Yes, that's right. I can't say that I completely understand, but I think I can perform my duties. It's not that easy! "Duties?" What are you even talking about? Iris, that's enough. Get back to work. Fine. Oh, that reminds me, I haven't introduced the other Dolls to you yet. You see, "Doll" refers to-- It's an abbreviation for Auto Memories Doll. I figured it out the other day. Right again. The girl just now… Her name is Iris. She's a new hire who just completed her training course. And that's Erica. She and I have both been working as Dolls for a while. You'll meet the others soon. This company is still pretty young, so, we're all kinda like rookies here. Violet, do you know how to use a typewriter by any chance? I've never used one before. Then why don't you start off by practicing typing? How can she become a Doll like this? Iris, can we borrow your manual? Yeah! So, uh, sit down. Understood, ma'am. Oh. Oh. It's better to take off your gloves. Okay. Are you okay? It's not a problem. Oh, then why don't you try it out a bit? Set the paper like this. Turn the knob and feed it in. Place your pointer fingers on these keys here and try typing something. Okay. That's right. Just like that. Now, just remember where your fingers should go for the different letters. Let's try typing what it says in this manual. Oh? Oh, wait. Violet. Violet! Stop! Uh… Do it a little more… quietly. Okay? I'm done! How is this? Mm. All right then, Violet, let's see. Yes. Hm. It looks good on you. My opinion was right after all. Oh, and don't forget this. Sorry for being late. You can open it. All right, then. This is… This is the brooch that the major gave me! It was on the black market. Someone must have stolen it from your belongings. So then, Violet, do you want to attend one of the Doll training courses? They have short-term courses, too. Iris attended one a while ago. Yeah, but the teacher is really strict. I think it'll be good for you. Leiden is such a big city! Yeah, I know. I got lost because it has so many more roads than where I'm from. They say it's easier to find a job if you received a brooch. I just want to graduate and then go home. I bet you just want the brooch. I guess. Quiet. Oh? Oh. Hmm. I would like to welcome all of you to the Auto Memories Doll Training School. I'm very sorry. You will be marked absent on your second tardy. Yes, ma'am. Now that the war is over, the demand for Dolls has never been higher. Of course, it is possible to become a Doll without attending our school. But our objective is not to train just another Doll. It is to train you to become the best Doll you can be. Graduating from our school is proof of excellence. However, if I do not deem you a worthy Doll, you will never be given this symbol. Are you prepared to begin? Affirmative, ma'am. A qualified Doll must be able to type as fast as someone is speaking. Now, you may begin. Is something wrong, Ms. Evergarden? You did not specify a speed. I see. Then you can type if it's specified? All right, 200 characters per minute. Affirmative. -I'll begin. -Very well. The letter-writing skills an admirable Doll must have includes knowledge of grammar, vocabulary, and several forms and styles for letters. Time is up. Now, I shall announce your evaluations for today. Grammar results. Full marks. Violet Evergarden. Vocabulary results. Full marks. Violet Evergarden. In today's class, we will be training to write on another's behalf. -Are you ready? -Let us do our best, Ms. Luculia. So, who do you want to address it to? Hm? By that, do you mean, someone I'd like to write to? Just choose someone close to you, who you'd like to express your feelings to. Someone I'm close to? Please address it to Mr. Claudia Hodgins. Claudia? Is that a friend? Family? He's my boss. That is all. I am concluding my report. Violet Evergarden. Oh, are you finished? Hm? -Then… -Mm. "Please let me know if you have received any new orders from the major." If you could add that to the end. It sounds more like a report than a letter. Okay. Now it is my turn to write your letter, Ms. Luculia. Oh. Let's see. My bro… No. I'll address it to my parents. Understood. I, um… I haven't been able to really thank my mother and father for everything they've done yet. Hmm. It's hard to express exactly what to say when it's time to actually write the letter. Oh, and all the places we've been to together, and the places we wanted to go. There's just so many to list. "See you soon. You don't need to worry about me. Sincerely, Luculia." Hmm. Would you mind reading this for me? Yes, ma'am. "Dear Father and Mother, it has been a while since we last spoke, but I have nothing specific to report. I worry that I have not expressed my gratitude for our previous engagements. Regarding the places we have been and desired to go, I have nothing to report. I am currently working very diligently. I am currently healthy and safe. There have been no issues. That is all. Please do not be concerned. Luculia." And do you really believe this is a viable letter? Oh, well, it could be that I was a little too abstract in expressing it. That is not the issue here. Letters are about communicating a person's true feelings. An admirable Doll will be able to find those feelings that the people want to communicate from their words. Violet, your grades are excellent and your typing is very fast and accurate. However, what you have written on her behalf can hardly be called a letter. You cannot call this a letter? -Um, I could try again-- -That is all for today. You just had an off day today. Except that this is not the first time someone has told me that. I see. I know. I'll show you the best view in the city. What do you say? It's here. Be sure to watch your step. Beautiful, right? I've always loved this view since I was a child. We used to come here. Violet. I hope that one day… you'll be able to see that beautiful view in Leiden. Well, I'm going this way. See you tomorrow. Ms. Luculia. Uh? You can just call me Luculia, okay? Go home already. Come on, don't be like that. Just one more. Brother! Were you drinking again? What? No, I wasn't. I said go home. I haven't had a drink because he won't let… Oh! Spencer! Are you okay? Leave. Luculia. It's okay. Thanks. Violet… -Hmp! -Hmp! …while I'm happy for the letter, it actually feels a little more like a report. My instructor also said that what I wrote could not be called a letter. So will I… be able to become an admirable Doll? Bluebell Junoa. -Yes. -Iberis Konoue. Yes. Luculia Marlborough. Luculia Marlborough? Oh! Here! Congratulations to the nine of you for graduating our program. I hope that all of you become admirable Dolls. We did it! Where are you going to work? I'm going to work in my hometown. I think I'll find something in Leiden. What about you, Luculia? Huh? Well, I… I actually haven't decided anything as of yet. What? But you were the top of our class. I see. It's unfortunate. I am sorry to disappoint you. Oh, it's all right. Not graduating doesn't really mean you can't become a Doll. Then… what was the purpose for going to that school? While it is true that graduating is not everything, if I am unable to understand the feelings they wish to communicate from their words, then there is no point in being a Doll. I knew you would come here. Luculia. Why are you here? The program is over now. Because I knew you'd be here and I wanted to talk to you. Tell me, Violet… Who is the major? When you write your letters, you always end it with "Has the major sent me any letters yet?" And so I was thinking, isn't he the one that you really want to send a letter to? I know. Why don't we write a letter to him today? You know, not like your usual reports, but a letter that actually shows what your feelings are. I won't leave until we're done. Major… I'm sorry. You see, the reality is that I have no idea what it is that I want to say to him. Because I don't even understand the meaning of the words he gave me. I am confused. Violet, why did you want to become a Doll? Because I… I want to know what "I love you" means. Oh. What does it mean? I see. It's hard to communicate your feelings, isn't it? The truth is that my parents have passed away. So all I have left is my brother Spencer. To be honest, sometimes I don't even know what I'm supposed to say to him. When the war began, my brother went off to fight as a soldier. But the truth is, there wasn't much fighting on the Western Front. That's where he was deployed. The fighting always seemed to be happening somewhere else. The war didn't seem real to us. It was just the stories. But… one day, when my parents went to Herne for business… the Western Front was broken. They looked all over for my parents but couldn't find any trace of them. And then the war ended. -My brother came home alive. -Come on, just one drink, okay? Give it a rest, would ya? I wanted to be happy that at least he was alive. What the hell? -But my brother was angry… -Shut up! …that he wasn't able to protect Herne. Angry that he wasn't there for our parents. He blames himself for their deaths. Don't show your face around here again. I was just… You see, I was just… I was just happy that he was alive. I only wanted to… to say "thank you." But… I can't. Luculia. Let's write a letter. Let's put all of your feelings into that letter. Say what you want. Yeah, but whenever I think about telling him how I feel, nothing comes out. I've tried so many times in the past. But it's no use. I'm sure I never will. Thank you, Violet. We'll write your letter to the major another time. An admirable Doll can… find the true feelings a client wants to communicate from their words. Spencer! Spencer, wait! Come on. Hm. Thanks. Hurry up. This way. Oh, wow! Pretty! Whoa! Wait. You're… You're Luculia's friend. -What's this? -A mission. No, an assignment. No, it's a letter. It is from Luculia to you. From Luculia? "To my brother. I'm happy. I'm happy that… that you are alive." "Thank you." LUCULIA MARLBOROUGH Violet! I was… -Luculia. -Huh? Is something wrong? Good morning to you, Violet. Instructor. Is school not finished? I'm sorry, I'm the one who asked her here. Luculia has decided to show me this letter. The letter you wrote on behalf of Luculia for her brother. You see, the feelings I've been wanting to tell my brother. Violet, you were able to tell him for me. An admirable Doll must find the true feelings the client wishes to communicate from the words they tell you. You were able to take that step. Violet. I truly hope you become an admirable Doll. Yesterday's play was so good, wasn't it? You should have come with us, Violet. If you mean the Red Demon, I am reading the play now. Ah, I'm so jealous. I would have loved to scribe for Oscar Webster. It means you get to read his new work first, doesn't it? It'll be his first new work in a while. I can't wait to see how it turns out. "Ah, I must suffer the consequences of the sins I have committed. For the rest of my life." GENETRIX ROSWELL REGION Who is it? It's the Auto Memories Doll service. I'm sorry. I didn't know. It is a pleasure to meet you. If it is your wish, I will travel anywhere to meet you. Auto Memories Doll at your service. Violet Evergarden. What a surprise. I wasn't expecting such a child. If I am not to your satisfaction, I can arrange for another Doll to take my place. No, as long as you can type. My health hasn't been the best lately. I am terribly sorry, but I will ask you to refrain from alcohol while we work together. I can't write unless I drink! I will be the one writing. Then let's start work tomorrow. Why must you be so difficult? Excuse me. I have cleaned the area for a better writing environment. I have brought my own typewriter. Do you have typing paper? I don't, sorry. They sell it at the store by the port. Go buy some. And dinner, too, while you're at it. I want carbonara. I'm sorry, sir. I'm only here to be a scribe, not a maid. Hm? Why must he be so difficult? I've got all the ingredients you need right here. Thank you very much. What's the matter? Is there a problem with it? No, I was just wondering how I'm supposed to cook this. Hm? Well, you crack the egg and then you separate the yolk. The yolk? Um, what are you doing? I am trying my hand at cooking. Well, you know, it's actually pretty good for your first try. -Are you not going to have any? -No. I will have some later. I see. Next is Olive's line. "We must cross this valley of fire in order to get the sword to slay the monster." Stage direction. "Enter a water spirit." The spirit's line. "I will put out this fire for you. Then you will be able to cross this valley." So, they'll be able to cross it? Thank goodness. Stage direction. "The burning fire is extinguished." How will it be extinguished? If they pull in the red cloth that was waving around the stage, it will look like it's been put out. I see. I understand. So, what are you thinking? Is it good? How do I put this? Just be honest with me. Even though it didn't really happen, it's as if I'm experiencing it. Ah. I find myself feeling like this girl, Olive. Feeling happy, and feeling sad. I feel uncertain about it. Why is that? Huh. Because you're feeling what Olive is. You're beginning to identify with her. You feel empathy with Olive. I'm relieved that you feel that way. This is my first time writing a play that's meant for children. After this, Olive will be able to cross the valley of fire, find the sword, and slay the monster, won't she? That's right. Although, in the process, she loses her power to commune with the spirits. Oh, no. But in that case, how is she going to return home? She has already lost her boat. Hmm. I haven't come up with that part yet. You have to. Or she… can't return to her waiting father. Do you have an idea? The weather is nice today. No, it's too good. -Sir. -Huh. Huh? What is this? Oh, it's just a parasol. Why do you ask? Because I think it's beautiful. Let me… take a little break. One day… I promise to show you one day. Stop it! Please, stop it. I apologize, sir. -I shouldn't have-- -That's enough! That's enough. Go home. Then the play will not be completed. Olive's story will never be completed. Sir, please wait! Is there something you're hiding inside your heart? You see, I… I'm unable to sense those feelings. I am… very sorry. I… I can't write anything anymore. But I can't let it end like this. So, that's why I thought I would finish the story. The one I told Olivia. Olivia? Yes. My daughter. After I lost my wife to illness, I moved here with my daughter. This used to be our summer home. I think she was sad not having a mother. But… she never actually showed it. Rather, she always helped me so I could focus on my work. My daughter's favorite things were silly frilled parasol and water birds. Wow! I'm so jealous. I want to try crossing this lake, too. Do you think I could walk on those leaves? Hm. Maybe if you let the wind carry you with your parasol. Olivia! I'm okay. I'm going to walk across this lake. I promise to show you one day. Okay, Daddy? And then… after arguing with the doctors, I decided to bring her back here to spend what time she had left. It was good to see her smile again. Our days were quiet and warm. But… my only hope… Why does God take what is most precious? Parting with someone who is important to you… Never being able to see them again… I never knew… that it was so sad and painful. I'm sorry for earlier today. No, you are the one who's truly in pain. I apologize for being the one to lose composure. I will finish it. I'll finish Olive's story. The girl will reach her home and be with her father. No matter how difficult the adventure, she… will have a happy ending. Both Olive and the audience will be happy. I will do it. The monster falls. Olive. "We finally slayed the monster." Water spirit. "You did very well." Wind spirit says, "We must return to the spirit realm." The Fire spirit says, "This is goodbye." Olive stands there. Completely unable to move. Now, then, how do we go about getting Olive home from here? Since her boat sank, can she take a plane? Hm. Maybe something a little more imaginative. She could fly home if she were a bird. What about the parasol? You cannot fly with a parasol. But she can! The Wind Spirit appears before her one last time and says, "Olive, open your parasol." Will you please try opening the parasol for me? "That parasol is your wings. You'll be carried away if you fly too high. So, step on the ocean's waves, the river's rocks, and the lake's fallen leaves." That's a great idea. Okay, after returning home, Olive reunites with her father. And then, the first thing she says when they're reunited after crossing the ocean… What should it be? "I'm home." No, "Father?" Sir, do you have writer's block again? Hm. Could you walk towards me from over there? I'd like to visualize it. I only need to walk? Yes. Across the fallen leaves on the lake if you can. Copy that. Huh? No, that last bit was just… I'm so jealous. I want to try crossing this lake, too. Do you think I could walk on those leaves? One day… I promise to show you one day. Okay, Daddy? How I wish I could hear you call me thata thousand times more. I wish… you didn't have to die. If only you could have lived, grown up… How I wished that for you. Were you able to see? I almost made it the entire way. Sir? What's the matter? Are you feeling ill? Are you sure I can have this parasol? Yes. I thought that I could fly a little further. You went far enough. You were able to fulfill my Olivia's wish for "one day". Her wish for one day? Well, then. Thank you for using our Auto Memories Doll service. It was a pleasure working with you. You have my gratitude. Violet Evergarden. You see, your soul is on fire. You're burning up right now because of the things you did. -I'm not-- -Yes, you are. You'll understand what I mean someday. And then you'll realize for the first time that you have many burns. Major. Just live. Am I allowed to? You have to be free. Am I really allowed to live… after killing so many? Have I not taken away someone's "one day" before? And did those people not have people they loved as well? I'm not burning. I am burning! I am not burning. I am burning! I feel the fire spreading from all the things I've done. I'm on fire. Oh? Violet, it's nice to see you. Madam. Please forgive me for my past actions. I sincerely apologize. It was never my intention to offend you. Oh, Violet, dear. Now, now, you don't have to apologize for anything. I'm so thankful to see how far you've come. I am sure Gilbert can rest in peace, too. Rest in peace? You said he was alive, didn't you? The major is safe, isn't he? Well, uh… He's alive. He just has to be! I'm sorry. I just couldn't bring myself to tell you. After the Final Battle of Intense, you were found alone on the ground under a church. Most likely, he pushed you away right before it was bombarded. While we didn't find his body, we did find his ID tag under the debris. So, he was deemed missing in action. So, we don't know for sure. -But given the situation… -I'm sure the major is alive. Violet, listen, I… He's alive! Violet, please understand, he's already… I won't. I don't understand. How could I be the only one to survive? The major was there with me. And he… All right. Now, look, I know it's hard. You have to accept it. Violet, wait! What's your name? I see. Would it be okay if I were to give you a name then? Huh? Oh. Violet. Your name's Violet. I have a feeling you'll grow into it when you're older. You'll become a person fitting of that name and not just a tool. Hello? It's you. I was wondering… is the major at home right now? So then, the major has… He isn't home now, right? The major is… Gilbert Bougainvillea. That's… the major's name. Major. What's the matter? Hello, Violet. Major? Major! I know that you're alive. That outfit. It's my job. I am currently working as an Auto Memory Doll. -You are? -Yes. I write letters for people. Letters, you say? With the same hands that took all those lives? Major? You're writing letters meant to connect people together? Major? Major. Major! What should I do? Please tell me. Oh, please. Give me an order. A letter for you. Violet Evergarden. This one's addressed to you. Erica and Iris asked me to deliver it. Very well, I've done my part now. It's late. You're still delivering? Yes. Well, I'm heading down Craft Street. Is there any way I could get you to cover the other route? Mm-hm. Yes, each one of these letters… is someone's precious memory after all. And every letter deserves to be delivered. It's a letter! Mom! It's from Dad! Have you finished your deliveries? Mm. Thanks for the help. Hm? That's great! They all finally made it home. "My dear Violet, are you okay? I thought about coming to see you, but after talking with Iris, we decided to write you a letter instead. It might be strange for a Doll to write to another Doll, but we wanted you to know that we are worried about you. And also, that we are here… waiting for you." You might not feel like coming back to work at the moment, so, please take your time. But if something happens, please don't hesitate to call us. Both Iris and I have faith that you will return. Also, someone named Spencer came in, asking for you to write a letter for him. He said he wanted to send a message to thank his younger sister. And to apologize. He tells us he wants you to write it. He insists that it has to be you. Is this to your satisfaction? Yes. It's actually a little embarrassing, sending a letter to your sister, but I just landed a new job and I owe it to her. She helped me decide to start over again. Sorry about this. Having to come all the way here. I heard that you were taking some time off work. My coworkers told me of your request… through a letter. It was the very first letter I'd ever received. And it helped me understand. I see how special it is to receive a letter. Oh. I think Luculia will be very happy. Thank you. Hm? One fitting of that name. A name… that is suitable. Huh? Oh. It is just as you said. I had burns all over my body. Is it okay? Huh? So, do I… do I have any right to be a Doll? -Oh. -Do I… Do I have any right to live? You can't erase the past. Although… Just know… everything you've done as an Auto Memories Doll… won't disappear either, Violet Evergarden. VIOLET EVERGARDEN What do you want to do today? I don't know. Playing house is a little boring. Yeah. I wonder when Mom's visitors are going to leave. They should go home already. Yeah. Hm. Huh? What's that? I saw a doll walking down the path. A really big doll. For some reason, I felt like she was something bad. Mom! Mom! Oh, Miss Ann. I see what you're saying, but… It's important to do. -Yes, but-- -Hey, Mommy! Oh, Ann. Haven't I told you that you need to knock before entering a room? Uh… And to give a proper greeting. Welcome to our home. -Pardon me, Mother. -My… That's much better. Now then, what is it? Don't tell me you found another strange bug? -If you did, please don't show me. -It's not a bug! I saw a doll coming to our house! A doll? Madam. She has finally arrived. Oh, you mean that Doll. That appointment was today, wasn't it? Please show her in, Ellis. -Of course, madam. -Wait a second! I'm very sorry, but I think we'll have to do this another time. But hold on, what are you going to do with this mansion? She can't live here on her own. That's why we offered to-- We'll discuss it next time. Wai-- Wait! -Ann. -Huh? Be a good girl for me, okay? So sorry to have kept you waiting. And thank you for coming all the way out here like this. It was no trouble. Wow, she can talk! If it is your wish, I will travel anywhere to meet you. Auto Memories Doll at your service. You're a doll! I knew it! Ann! -I'm sorry about that. -It's fine. I am Violet Evergarden. Please, have a seat. Would you like some tea? I hope you find it to your liking. -Please go ahead. -Thank you. Oh. Oh? She drank it! -What happens to the tea? -Ann. It will eventually be expelled from my body and return to the earth. Ann, please don't be rude. Shall we begin? I understand that I have been hired for a seven-day period. Is that right? That's right, and I'd like to start right away. All right, I understand. Where is it that you would like us to work? Well, how about we go into the sunroom? It's always nice and bright in there. What are you doing? Our guest came here today to help me write a letter. But how come? I would've written a letter for you. Thanks, but you don't know how to spell some of the hard words. I can write it! I'm sure you can. But Miss Violet is very well-known for the wonderful letters that she writes for people. Who is the letter to? The letter's for… somebody who's very far away. -Far away? -Yes. It's a very important letter. So please don't interrupt us, all right? Shall we, Miss Violet? Understood. Hmp. I have brought my own typewriter to use. I see. That's fine with me. All right, then let's begin. I knew there was something bad about her. You see? She really is a doll. Madam! Mom, are you okay? I'm just fine, dear. I'll be better soon, all right? You will? I promise. I know! I can sing you a lullaby if you want! That's very sweet. But grownups don't need lullabies to help them sleep. Oh. Then can I sleep here with you? Oh. But I thought you were too big to take naps anymore. It's okay for just today. Well, instead, dear, I'd rather you go entertain our visitor. I hate visitors. They all try to take you away from me. Oh. I'm sorry, Ann. But please, it's just for seven days. So be a good girl for me. All right? Hm. My mother said she's going to be resting for a little while. I see. She's just a little sleepy. During that time, I told her that I would entertain you instead. I actually hate visitors, but you're a doll, so it's okay. What are we going to do? Mm. Well, I guess we could talk or play, or something like that, you know. -That is outside my expertise. -Huh? However, if it is only for a little while… -Then let's play with my doll! -Okay. A doll playing with another doll, that's so funny! What is it that I do with this? Oh, well, you just have to talk to her or take care of her, obviously. The first thing to do is say hello. Hello there! Hello there. Oh, hello. Oh! The doll was the one who said that! Oh, I see. I understand then. Oh, right! I forgot that you're a doll, so, you've never actually played with one that's just like you, isn't that right? No, I-- That's okay. I'll teach you how! First, you and I are gonna go play house. I have a table for us in the yard. Excuse me, your room is ready, ma'am. I'd be glad to show you to it if you like. Thank you. You will have to excuse me. Oh. Your room is on the second floor. I wonder what they're talking about. Oh! Ellis! -I can take that out! -Oh, no. You certainly may not. This is my job after all. Please don't take it from me. Ah! Why does life have to be so unfair all the time? "Then, the thief was surprised. 'Ah!' He yelled. And then, he ran away for good." Did you know that you are really good at reading stories to someone? Violet! What are you supposed to do if bread is really hard and can't be eaten? You could put it in soup to soften it. Violet! Violet! Until my mom comes out here, let's do riddles and dance together and play house and catch bugs. Do you want to? -Miss Ann. -Huh? Please tell me the order of priority. So, what do you think? -I think it's very good. -Then, I'll continue this way. Thank you. -Ann? -Oh, I'm sorry! Uh, I was thinking of having Violet tie a ribbon in my hair. All right, fine. Perhaps, a little later. Madam, would you allow me to have a short break? Huh? I believe Miss Ann would appreciate it now. There you are, Miss Ann. You're not the person I actually wanted to tie the ribbon in my hair. -I know. -I really wanted my mom to do it. -I know. -And she's the one I want to read with, and do riddles and play house with. But I know my Mom doesn't like bugs. Would you stop taking away my time with my mom, Violet? Just a few more days. Then you have to tell my mom it's okay for me to be there when you're writing the letter for her! I just want to be near her! All I want is to be close and squeeze her hand. Will you? I am terribly sorry, I cannot do that. Why not? I'm sorry, Miss Ann. But unfortunately, I must be getting back now. Do you think we'll be able to finish today? Yes, if we continue at this pace. Madam, if you would, please. Madam? I'll be okay. I just… Oh! Madam! -I'll be all right. -But… No. Please, continue. -Stop! That's enough! -No, Miss Ann! -Mom! That's enough! -Ann. I'm okay, really. So please, go play in the yard. But why? Why are you writing this letter? Who is it for? Daddy isn't even with us anymore! It's a very important letter. It's probably for someone I don't know, isn't it? Someone who doesn't even visit you! There isn't anyone who really cares about you anyway! No one! Is this letter more important than I am, Mom? There's nothing more important than you, darling. You're such a liar. I would never lie to you. You are! You're not getting better at all! And you told me you were going to get better. You promised me! That's right. I already know, okay? I know that if… If you're gone, then I'm gonna be left here all alone! Just how much longer will I be able to be with you? If I'm going to be all alone anyway, then can you please stop writing some letter and spend time with me now! Please, Mom! Please! Please, Mom! -I just want… -Miss Ann. …to spend time with you! Miss Ann! Wait! Miss Ann. I want to reassure you that the time I spend with your mother is for a good cause. So, please, I would ask you not to be angry with your mother. But… But… It is only natural that this is painful for you. You had to accept your mother's sickness at such a young age. You are very admirable. I'm not. No, I'm not! I… I made Mom… I made her cry! You didn't. In fact, you are a very kind person. -I'm not. -You are. I'm not! I'm not! I'm not! My mom got sick because I'm a bad girl! That's not what she said. It is! It is! There is nothing… There is nothing that can be done. You're wrong! It's just like my arms can never be soft and warm like the way yours will always be. There is nothing that can be done. Mom! Mom! Why is she writing a letter? People have feelings they want to express to others. Who cares? They don't need to. There is no such thing as a letter that doesn't deserve to be delivered, Miss Ann. Then, the day came when the doll who visited us had finished writing the letters and it was time to say goodbye. Violet! Hm? -Thank you, Miss Ann. -Huh? It's warm. Wait, are you… Then what about the tea you drank? As I said, I will eventually expel it from my body and it will return to the earth. She wasn't a doll after all. And she wasn't something bad either. She was very kind. I really wish that I could have read the letters she wrote. I wonder who they were for. Ann. Come, dear. Come inside and have some tea. Mom, let's play with my doll! -Okay. -Then we can read books -and play house and… -All right. Ann. Ann. My sweet girl. Ann. Dear Ann. Happy eighth birthday. There might be many sad things happening, and you might be feeling really overwhelmed right now. But don't give up hope. I know you may be sad and feel like crying sometimes, but please, don't ever forget, your mother loves you very much. Even now. Dear Ann, happy tenth birthday. I'm sure you've grown up quite a lot. But I imagine you still love reading and dancing like you always did. Perhaps you moved on from riddles and bugs? Happy 18th birthday. You're a young lady now. Have you fallen in love? I might not be able to help you with that, but I'm sure whoever you choose is a wonderful person. Happy birthday, Ann. You're already 20 years old now. That's amazing. But remember, that even adults are allowed to complain sometimes. Whenever you're feeling down, remember that I am with you. Ann. I will always, always be watching over you. Great work, Violet. You did so many. These letters are to be delivered to Ann Magnolia over the course of the next 50 years. You wrote 50 letters? It was the first extended trip you've taken in a while. Did you handle it okay? -There was no problem. -But this is great. She's going to look forward to these coming every year. Yes, but… …by the time they arrive, her mother will already be… She's still so little. She gets so lonely. And Ann's mother will be leaving her precious daughter alone. She'll be left all alone… in that mansion. I… I… had to hold back my tears the whole time I was at the mansion. I know. But, Violet… they'll reach her. All the letters you wrote for her. Don't worry. No matter where she is, you'll see. A LOVED ONE WILL ALWAYS WATCH OVER YOU
