[APPROACHING AUTOMOBILE] [AUTOMOBILE HONKING] Well, I never! Check your gun, cowboy. - What'll be? Beer? - Yeah. - Hey, get that sack off the bar. - Just a minute. Just a minute. You don't even know what's inside. Get that snake out of here! Aw! He ain't gonna hurt nobody in the jar. I only brought him in here for a sporting proposition. I don't care. Get this thing out of here. Boo! You see, I've got a dollar that says there ain't a man in here who can put his hand up against the glass when the snake strikes. Now that sounds like an easy way to make a dollar. Yeah, ain't it? Careful now. You got weak nerves. Takes one chance just to get used to it. - Let me try again. - No no no no, Sam. No, Sam. It's my turn. You flinched. Look, I'm putting down $5 for five more. - We got a game here! - I think I'm getting the hang of it. - It's only a matter of concentration. - Concentration. Wait wait wait. I've got four more chances. - Hey, wait a minute. Oh, hi. Hi, Brandy. - Hey. Take 'em for the count, kid. You fought meaner snakes than that. That away, Brandy. You did it. Pick up the money. No, we'll let the creep keep the money. COWBOY: He moved. - Who said? - You moved. Everybody saw you. Maybe you could do it better, huh? - For how much? - Oh, I am sorry, Mr. Rockefeller. I didn't know you was in town. - Is 10 bucks rich enough for you? - $50. Yeah, let's go. CONMAN: I'm betting all I got right here on the cowboy. Uh-huh. Well well. Hey, what are you supposed to be in that get-up? - Some kind of Jesse James or something? - Something. Well, you are one hell of a snake kisser. I'll say that for you. Hey, where'd you learn how to do that? No, wait a minute. Don't tell me. I seen that a couple of times before. I got a snake maybe you'd like to kiss. Hey, he's a contender, cowboy. You'd better not stick around. How many times I gotta tell you, Brandy? You're a pro, that means you never fight for free. Look out! That damn thing. Get out of the way! Billy, the crutch, the crutch. This thing's got no fangs. We've been conned! Mr. Colby. - Mr. Colby. BILLY: Sam, look at that. We turned better than $100 back there. - I'm gonna... - Come here, you. - Took what? - They took 50 bucks. Billy, looky there. The man in the tall hat, don't you recognize him? Are you kidding? In a machine like that? I heard tell that he's one of your rich millionaires now. Oh, Sam. You seen him in every town from here to Omaha, excepting each time it wasn't him at all. I gotta find Joe Knox. You got any idea where he might be? How in the hell do I know where he is? You know that he ain't but half a white man. Who in the hell do you think you are? And it's cold, and you're taking us out in the middle of the night without any clothes on. - It's really cold. - Yeah! Coming into a private house, interrupting our business. Let me go! Let go of me! - You're hurting my arm, you jackass. - Let go of me! Will you stop it? - You let me go! - Hey! What's the matter with you? WOMAN: That's my foot you stepped on. Oh, I can't believe it. WOMAN: Move over! Hey, you crazy Indian, get out of there! Giddy-up, yah yah yah! Hyah hyah hyah hyah! Hyah hyah! Whoa! Do not be afraid, ladies. Do not be frightened, ladies. After all, I did rescue you, did I not? Did I not grab you from the very jailhouse doors? Did I not, hmm? Perhaps I should introduce myself. My name is "Knock down soldiers with a stick." In other words, Joseph Prendergast Knox, esquire, off the reservation and out of Harvard university, class of '84. Now the way I see it, I did save you ladies, didn't I? But I'm not asking you to thank me. Well, leastways, not all at once. Now it has been a very long time since I last scalped a white lady. I'm not even sure that I recall how to do it, but I do know one thing, ladies... That it is messy! Now this one was Miss Gladys Ackerman, my fourth grade teacher at missionary school. I loved her a little bit. Now this one, this one was a lady who stomped on my toe in an elevator in Cincinnati. Huh? Well, you ladies get my meaning, don't you? Now why don't you just sit back quietly, ladies, and enjoy the ride? Sit! Gentlemen and... Most welcome ladies, we're staging this fight at Serenity because Serenity is a boom town. A lot of money. A lot of votes... We need them both. May I make the following suggestion? When anybody asks me why I back William Howard Taft for the presidency of the United States, I don't give them political theory or economic folderol. I simply say, "I only back Taft" because I only back winners. A toast... William Howard Taft, next president of the United States. ALL: Hear hear! And another toast, gentlemen, to another winner. The next governor of the state, Jack Colby. Come on, move! Hey, ladies. Hey, what do you got here, Joe Knox? Whores, Billy, whores! Whores? Well, where'd you get 'em? I found them lying around. - Whose are they? - They're mine, Billy. This is Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and little Saturday here. And who is this? - Sunday? - No. Holidays! - Hot damn! - Go on up. Up up up! Go on, up up up! Up up, 90 on, get up! There you are. - Hey, you're gonna share 'em? - Nope. That ain't nice. Ain't I always shared with you? Grub, tobacco and all? How about just one? Maybe that little skinny one right here? No, Billy. I need them for my job. I have got a mission. But they ain't missionary ladies. They're just plain old nickel-a-ride mattress backs. You're looking at a man, Billy, who, armed with nothing but his own badly battered sword of justice, is gonna drive the white man from this land that he has raped and he has pillaged! I don't follow you, Joe Knox. - Have you heard of typhoid Mary? - Yeah. Well, meet pox Knox. I don't follow you, Joe. Well, you see, I have caught myself a dose of cupid's itch. The white man's gift to the red man, Billy. I have got the clap! Ahhh! You keep your distance, Injun! You go get the cure and quick. Never never. I am going to be a one-man epidemic. Ew! I have got a hard job ahead of me. A couple of weeks from now I'm gonna release this little lot and capture myself another batch and so on and so on. Until one day across the land of the free and the home of the brave, the white man is gonna say to his wife, "Honey, guess what?" And even in the white house itself president Teddy Roosevelt is going to turn to his cabinet and say... Joe Knox, where the hell have you been? I've been looking all over town for you. Sam Longwood, you keep away from these ladies 'cause they're mine. Oh, just put that dumb thing down. - Guess what. - What? I seen Jack Colby. - Colby? Where? - Yeah. Here. - Here? - Yes, I did. Get out of here! Go on, get out of here. Get out! - Where's he staying? - At the Denver house. Joe Knox is no friend of mine. He could have left me at least one. Time. Glad you could come by. Tomorrow's another day. - Oh, Mr. Colby? - Yes, my dear? I do think that you are the most handsome man - in this room. - Well, I certainly wouldn't say that, but I appreciate your honesty and candor. And you must also be the most eligible man. Eligible for what? Madam, I'll have you know I am very happily married. - But so am I. - Well, in that case... Well... How..- Two friends of mine. I haven't seen them in 15 long years. Will you excuse me just for a moment, my dear? Of course. Sam. And Joe Knox. Must be six, seven years anyway. 15. - 15... has it been that long? - That long. - Folks, ladies and gentlemen, let me have your attention just for a moment. It gives me great pleasure at this time to introduce to you a man you've all read about in the history books, a genuine hero of the western frontier, one of the men who made this country what it is today. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the famous scout and Indian fighter, Mr. Sam Longwood. This ain't a social call, Jack. Either you pay us the money you owe us now, or I'm gonna tell these good folks how you got started in the millionaire business. Sounds like a threat. You wouldn't threaten me, would you, Sam? Folks, me and Jack Colby here and Joe Knox go back a long way together... Way before he got his first railroad train or got into politics. Yes, folks, Jack Colby here was respectable once. You see, him and me and Joe Knox had this little gold claim up on the west rim of death valley. And we set aside a tidy sum. And then one morning, Joe Knox and me got up and found, much to our surprise... Hello, Jesse James. Now why in the world do you suppose Sam would wanna go to making up stories about an old friend? Maybe he didn't trust you to give us back our money, Jack. Can you imagine that? You trust me though, don't you? Yes, I do. Now... It's funny. You don't know. I wished I'd have stayed with you boys many's the time. No, you don't. Not unless you're completely stupid. Thank you, Joe Knox. Nice of you to put it just that away. Enough of these compliments. We spent seven months mucking that gold - and you took off with all of it. - Yes, I did. I certainly did. Would you like to know why? - I don't care one cow plot why. Because that money meant absolutely nothing to you, except another six-week drunk in a San Francisco whorehouse and then right back to more of the same. But you, you had god's own visions burnt in a rock, huh? Yes, it's called an empire... Steel rails all the way across this country, link the Atlantic states to the Pacific, give jobs to the jobless and homes to the homeless, make this country fine and wonderful, the way it can be and should be. How's that sound? And for that mess of nothing, you crooked your pals. How'd you boys like to see the fight Saturday night? I'll go you one better. I'm on my way out to Vishniac's training camp, - you ever ride in an automobile? - The money, Jack. I would have got your damn money to you if I could have found you. - I tried years ago. - You're lying. - How do you know? - Your lips are moving. You ask Nancy Sue if I'm lying. Her train is due from Chicago tomorrow night. You mention her name one more time and I'll slit your throat. What, and leave her a widow? You were always hard cases, both of you. You haven't gotten any better. Sam, look at me. I used to be able to have some fun with my life. Now I'm tied to a desk 25 hours a day. Yeah, we have a railroad. We also have thousands of little investors driving me crazy worrying about their stake. Yeah, that's good enough for you to say, but we could have been rich. We could have been somebody, instead of dust eaters and cow kickers. We could have bought some respectability with that money. All right. All right! How do you want it? Two checks for $2,000 each or one for $4,000? Jack, you see the way that Sam and I had it figured, - we figured you'd owed us $100,000. - We'll settle for less. - Say $60,000. - Yeah, $60,000. Only $60,000? I'll see you in hell first. Yeah, well, that can be arranged too. Sorry, boys. That's a little bit high. When you're ready to settle for the $4,000... You better cut him once, Joe Knox, just to show him we ain't dirt farming. That won't be necessary. Now if you boys'll excuse me, I'll get back to my invited guests. So you can stop payment on this check, huh? One thing we haven't got in 15 years is dumber. No, you couldn't have. - Don't worry, friend. We're gonna stick together like blood brothers until after the banks open tomorrow morning. And when you open this door, have your friend move on down the hall. Over there. Over there. Sorry if we scared your horse. Sorry and $2 could buy us a pine box, ma'am. You fellas heading for the fight over in Serenity? - SAM:That's right, ma'am. - Mike... My girl here says she saw you last night with an injun. Half-breed by the name of Joe Knox? Kidnapped one of my friends. Kidnapped? WOMAN: One of my young ladies... skinny little thing, brown hair, about 17. You sure you fellas ain't seen them? SAM: No, ma'am. I certainly haven't. I heard they was heading for the fight. So if you see 'em, look me up in Serenity. My name's Mike. Mike? Anyone bringing in that Knox fella and the young girl, there's 50 bucks in it for them. Or a dozen free visits to my place. Hi. Ooh! $50 and a free visit? Ma'am, we got him. He's right here! Billy, sit down. What does she mean you stole one of her girls? Well, wouldn't you know we'd get the runt of the litter. Little Thursday, would you like a bit more stew? Well, thank you, but I'm still trying to find the courage to finish this. Hey! JOE KNOX: I says she gets raped. SAM: Raped? What's that, an old Indian tradition? It's an old army tradition. I was conceived at Wolf Paw Massacre, remember? Well, the army teaches its men to love the enemy. Yes, in groups. Hey! My father was a sergeant, two corporals, a bugler and a company cook. Well, that makes you about five, six white men after all. I think the army did you a favor. And I have been trying to repay that favor ever since I learned to use a hunting knife. For Christ's sake, would you put those moldy scalps away? I happen to know that you bought 'em off a drummer in new haven, Connecticut, for 50 apiece. That is what he says. I shall now teach him how I really won them. Wait wait! No no no, please please please please. I can't have you killing yourself defending my honor. I just couldn't live with that. Now I don't like the idea of getting raped either... You got about as much chance of getting raped around here as Joe Knox. You're... you're not gonna rape me? No! ma'am. Well, why not? I mean, ain't I good enough? Well, then who? Nobody's business is who. Jack Colby's wife is who. We're gonna kidnap and rape her. Wait a minute. If it's Jack Colby you're both so mad at, what do you wanna mess around with his wife for? 'Cause she dumped Sam Longwood is why. They was engaged to be married, but Nancy Sue dropped him like a burnt match when a certain Jack Colby puffed out his feathers. Why, you old jackass, why don't you give your mouth the rest of the day off? Psst. This here is Nancy Sue. What a beautiful lady. Who told you to show her that? The person in this picture is much too fine and pure to be held in the hands of a common prostitute. Begging your pardon, ma'am. Now put it away. What happened to your pride, Great Scout? To your sense of tradition? If we do not give Colby back a wife that is soiled, then the $60,000 will not be worth spending. But if you do not do your duty as a man, then I will have to do it for you. You try it and you won't have one left to do it with. Talk like that could get a man's liver dropped into the dust. - Or his throat cut. - That you will never do, white man. SAM: I've killed more Indians in my time than I have buffalo. Now's our chance, sugar. While them two peacocks is kicking each other's heads in, let's you and me slip off to the bushes and do a little fancy humping. Dirty old goat! I'm gonna teach you once and for all to keep your filthy hands off of me! Help me, help! She's gonna kill me! Hey, what's wrong with you? You dirty old man! Gosh darn you! Just leave me alone from now on! Truce, damn it, truce! Billy sure is a strange guy. Especially when he's kicked in the hmm-mmms. - Oh ho. - Uh-huh. - Mmm. - Hmm. Don't you touch me. You just get away from me. I really think you got the wrong idea, miss. About me anyway. I never had to do with whores, except when I could help it. Nothing personal intended. Sure. Promised your dear old mother? I can do without that smart talk from you. Nobody invited you along on this trip, remember? I was kidnapped by that drunken half-breed. From the jailhouse, yes. But to here, I did no such thing. You're a bunch of kidnappers. That's what you are. If we were, why would we kidnap you? Skinny little thing like you wouldn't bring better than a penny a pound from any cathouse from here to New Orleans. Now the minute we get to Serenity, this piece of goods goes back to its rightful owner. - That's right. - Oh no, you don't. You stole me and you're stuck with me. I just may stay until we get back into town. And then if you'd be kind enough to lend me the fare - for a railroad ticket... - Don't tell me. So you can get back home and visit your dear old mom and dad on the poor little rundown farm out of green branch, Ohio? North... North Platte, Nebraska. North Platte, Nebraska. Why are you so tough on her, Sam? I'm not being tough on her. It's just I've heard that same story from a thousand bang tails in my day. Oh! Well, I thought you never had to do with whores. I said when I could help it. A lot of times I couldn't help it. Pay no attention to that sanctimonious old hypocrite. Tell me, what do they call you, little one? Well, tell him. We can't go on calling you just Thursday, can we? We have a job to do. We cannot take you with us. But you don't understand. Mike... She doesn't even hardly let me go with the customers. Well, what's she doing? Saving you for herself? Yes. That's the most disgusting thing I ever heard. SAM: ♪ We love you, William Howard ♪ ♪ You're free from taint and graft ♪ ♪ We'd like you for our president ♪ ♪ Mr. William Howard Taft! ♪ ♪ The lion and the elephant ♪ ♪ The monkey and giraffe ♪ ♪ All the animals are voting ♪ ♪ For William Howard Taft... ♪ William Howard Taft sucks rotten eggs. ♪ We hate you, William Jennings ♪ ♪ Your head is up your ass ♪ ♪ We'd like to piss on Bryan ♪ ♪ And vote for Howard Taft! ♪ Very nice words to sing about the great commoner. Where did you manage to find them, on an outhouse wall? What if I made them up? If the Indian gets to vote, then you can bet mine won't go to that tub of bear grease. Besides, Jack Colby is supporting Taft. How can you vote for somebody with supporters like that? Yeah, I know. That's the trouble. But you see, I've always voted Republican. It is said that everybody has their faults, but if you hate Colby like you should, then you should vote for William Jennings Bryan. - I'd vote for him if I could. - Nobody asked you. And I'll tell you why, because he's gonna give women the vote. Might as well give 'em the right to pee standing up, they wouldn't know what to do with it. I don't suppose you use your moldy old equipment for much anything else anyway. Is that so? After we turn you over to that madam of yours, she promised us free guest privileges Sam's not turning me in. Oh, yes, he is, little one. For the $50 we get for you, we'll be able to buy two Colt six-shot repeaters. Sam? Hey, what are you doing? Hey, miss, you're gonna get your tail whacked! Hey hey! What he means is he's gonna kick your... Hey, Sam! The whiskey jug. Right there beside that little bush. Hyah hyah! Hey! Hyah hyah! Pull back, little one, pull back! Come on, come on, giddyap! Come on! Hyah! Whoa, horse. Wait a minute. Hyah! Stop that damn wagon! What's the matter with you? I said stop! Hyah hyah! You can't get away from Joe Knox, little one. Not Joe Knox... aggh! Whoa whoa, easy, horse. Whoa, horse, whoa! Whoa! Whoa there, horse! Horse, stop! Hold on, Sam. Ooh, ow! Oh my god! - Jump! - Jump! - The horse? - Oh, he's halfway to Wyoming by now. We'd better get moving. Serenity's bound to be a walk and a half from here. No, just a mile and a half through that canyon. Billy, you look around and see if you can find any more of our stuff and set up camp down there. And, Joe Knox, you go unload this mess of trouble! Oh no, I'm not going anywhere with him. He's got the clap. Clap! What kind of a way is that for a young lady to talk? Well, it's true. Isn't it, Billy? You heard him. Tell him. He said he's got it so I guess he's got it. You whiskered windbag, you sure can keep a secret, huh? Secret, hell, you said yourself you was gonna spread it all the way across the nation, clean to the white house. It is but a temporary condition, Sam. I will get rid of it. Like you did the first time. You're damn right you'll get rid of it... First thing we get to Serenity. You know that we've all been living out of the same duffel, drinking out of the same cup. Ew! You can't get it that way. Unless of course you was doing something else. You know you could rot your brain... what you've got. You could go blind. It could fall off. Now you get that taken care of. And I don't mean by no moldy medicine man. I mean by a white American doctor. That's right! And what'll he do? And he'll heat it on his little stove until it's real hot. And then he'll... Joe Knox no go to doctor. I thought Indians could take any amount of pain without flinching. Not this Indian. Don't listen to the old man. All the doctor's gonna do is to give you a little pill. That'll fix you. You sure? Of course I'm sure. We're not living in the dark ages anymore. Modern medicine has taken great strides. Great strides. Come on, miss. I'm gonna unload you. - Let go of me! - Let's go. No, let go! BILLY: Joe Knox. SAM: Look at them prices. "Cash or gold accepted." No wonder Jack Colby wants to hold the fight here, huh? Well, come on. Come on, you little squirt. Sam Longwood never spanked a lady in his life, but for you, - I'll make an exception. - Are you really? - Am I really what? - Sam Longwood. - I am. - I mean the real... the real Sam Longwood. As best as I can recollect, that was my father's name too. I knew it. I knew it. You fought howling coyote at the battle of Chickasaw Wells, didn't you? Why, that's so. I've heard about you. - You have? Where? - In books and newspapers and things. - You got reading? - I do. I do. And I've read all about you in school. You're a hero of our country. I guess that's been said a time or two. You... You captured Geronimo. You captured Geronimo practically single-handedly. - ...Single-handedly. Who'd ever dream I'd meet the real Sam Longwood? You're much younger than I would have guessed. I mean, you're not all that old for a hero of our country. All right, it's dumb and I know it. But I'm gonna give you a break, so why don't you just run along? Run along where? I don't know. Get a job someplace washing dishes or something. - I can't do that. - Why not? Because Mike would find me. You know, doctor, it is truly amazing the steps modern medical science has made over the last few years. Truly amazing. Just drop your trousers, please, Mr. Knox. What for? I mean, this is not the dark ages, is it? I thought you were gonna give me a pill or something. You got it the same old way. We cure it the same old way. Now that wasn't bad, was it? Now you hold on, Joe Knox. I only did that for your own good. Yeah, pill only good for Joe Knox. All right, you red-assed, clap-ridden squaw-hopper. I will cut you to pieces, white man. If you can get close enough. Sam, Joe Knox, wait! There's the little minx! Sam, what about our $60,000? If we don't get it this time, it's gonna be a long slide back. That ain't no reason to send this child back to a life of shame and degradation. You horny hypocrite. You're worse than Billy. You wouldn't know Christian charity if it jumped up and bit you in the ass. You know what? I'd sure as hell recognize a Colt .45. That's what we come to this town for, isn't it? We'll make do. With that? Not that way! Hi. Molly, Becky, girls. Now, girls, I'd be careful if I were you. Mr. Longwood ain't partial to no whores. That is too bad, isn't it? Come on, boys. Joe Knox, what are you doing? Indian tradition... Always take hostages. You two wait out here in the hall. Who fired that... Well, if it isn't my little friend who was kidnapped. Or did she run away? Hey, Mike. I told you to wait out there in the hall. What's this? - Mike! - Molly, be quiet. Shut up! Hey, wait for me! Get out of my way! Damn. They was supposed to turn over the girl for $50 so they could buy a couple of six-shooters so we could get our money back from Jack Colby. Well, they come back, they ain't got the money. They've still got the damn girl. Well, I'm telling you right here and now, she ain't cooking for me. Not after her previous line of employment. And another thing, what about my free visits to the cathouse? What about that, huh? I never get to have no fun. - Billy. - Oh, Billy, Billy. A lot you care about Billy now that you've got what you want. That's no way to talk to a hero of our country. Oh, so that's how she turned your comb red, great scout, with that old hero crap. Sam, why don't you and me take us a walk down by the creek? It just so happens that this young lady has a sense of history. Uh-huh, and where do you think she got the sense of history from? Me! Me, that's who. She didn't know Sam Longwood from a hole in the ground until I gave her your scrapbook to read. Captain Longwood, you've been took. Sam. That will be Nancy Sue's train pulling into Serenity junction. Sam, if we are going to do it, now is the time. She hasn't changed much, Sam. You bet she hasn't. As fine and pure example of American womanhood as you could hope to find on the frontier. She sure is a beautiful woman, Sam. Yes. I will give her that. Remember those white dresses she used to wear that would button up to the throat? And the gloves. Remember the white gloves, Joe Knox? Even when she came out to visit me at the mine. Damn, it takes me back. That pure soft-spoken angel. There in the middle of the Panamint mountains, a living, shining, honest-to-god angel. Easy, stud horse. Now get your clothes on and you go tell Jack Colby that he ever wants to see his wife alive again, he better come up with that $60,000 he owes us. Now move. Before I blow your brains off. SAM: Nancy Sue, it's me, Sam Longwood, and Joe Knox. You dumb cock-walloping shit. What the hell is this? Is this a kidnapping or some kind of a goddamn Sioux death march? I am not one of your goddamn raggedy-ass walking squaws. What's the matter with you two cow turds anyway? Have you got scabs on your tongue? I tell you, Sam Longwood, you better think of something to say, because when Jack Colby hears about this, my god! And I tell you, when I think that I almost... Shit! That tears it. I am not taking one more goddamn step. You can take your goddamn kidnapping and you can shove it up... What's come over you, Nancy Sue? We turn our backs for a few years and here you are cussing like a mule-Skinner, cheating on your husband. You know, that ain't ladylike. I gotta tell you, Nancy Sue, - I'm disappointed in you. - If you think I give... One more filthy word out of that sewer pipe you call a mouth, just one, and Jack Colby's $60,000 won't buy him back nothing but your mortal remains. Now I have warned you and that's the end of it. Now when we get where we're going, I want you to act like a goddamn lady. - She's even prettier than her picture. - Mm-hmm. Good evening, Billy. How have you been? Fine, miss... I mean, ma'am. I've been just fine. Sam, I made some dinner for you. Sam! Billy, where'd Sam get the chippy? She ain't nobody's. She just sort of come along for the ride. Thursday: Sam. Sam. Are you awake? It's me, Sam. Oh, yeah. I'm really sorry that I lied to you about knowing who you were and all. It don't matter. But it really was only half a lie. I did find out all about you from the scrapbook, but it was the most thrilling and patriotic thing I've ever read in my entire life. Why'd you burn it, Sam? Past is past. When we go into town, do you think... Who says you're coming along? I can't be going around with no kid tagging after. You didn't think I was much of a kid last night. It was cold last night. In the dark, you felt a lot older. I felt a lot younger. Then close your eyes. I've been with a lot of men and I ain't denying that. It's just that last night with you was the first time... You don't suppose that could mean I love you or something. I'm sorry. ♪ His truth is marching on ♪ ♪ Glory glory, hallelujah. ♪ Hey! Hallelujah, Sam. Glory, hallelujah! Where are you going, Sam? - I'm going into town to get my money from Jack Colby and then get shed of the bunch of you. I've been shot five times, knifed twice, bit in the ass by a pig, stomped on by a horse and sat on by a mule. Once in the winter of '81, a grizzly chewed my big toe off. And I survived two avalanches, three blizzards, five Indian uprisings and seven presidential elections, but I ain't never been owned by no woman nor dog. And I come too far down the road to let it happen to me now. JACK: So you have got my wife, have you? SAM: Hog-tied. You can have her back for $60,000. - Still $60,000? - Still $60,000. I guess if I've had the woman for 15 years... On the other hand, here you come along, I know you always wanted to make her happy. I couldn't even make her shut her mouth. One thing I'll guarantee you, Sam, she's honest-to-goodness thoroughbred stock... Blue blood, black tongue, pedigree and all. So you hop to it. $60,000 is a little steep. I wouldn't give you 60 to get her back. You want her back with her throat cut? If you have to. I hope you do it quick and painless, for old times' sake. - I mean it. - On the other hand, it might bean improvement. With her throat cut, she wouldn't be able to complain quite so loud. She had damn little to complain about, compadre. Furs and jewels from head to foot and not a bruise on her, not a Mark, still that mouth kept working. Perhaps that's something you know a little about already. Huh, Sam? No, she's yours by rights now. I won't interfere. Maybe you can do something with her. I sure couldn't. Adios, compadre. I got a fight to put on here. Give my best regards to Nancy Sue. You sure you can afford them? No need to be bitter. You get to save the girl. I get to save the money... So far. Looks like it worked out pretty good all around. Excuse me. Jack, I think you're spitting in the wind. Well, no more than you, compadre. Colby! Yeah, there was a time you could have done it, Sam, but no more. You're thinking about it, which means you're not gonna do it. And if you tried, your demise wouldn't make the back page of the police gazette. It's too late, partner. You're too slow. So am I. Better move along before these boys turn you into dog meat. The lousy goddamn... Can you imagine that tight-fished chicken hearted... Selling his own goddamn wife down the river - for 60-goddamn thousand... - Nancy Sue, I warned you. You warned me to keep my filthy mouth shut. Well, what are you gonna do now, kill me? I'm not worth 10 goddamn cents to you stomped, strangled or raped. That's the angel of the Panamint mountains? It used to be. JOE KNOX: Let her go, Sam. We just ride into town Saturday and take what is ours. Ride in on what? We steal the horses, great scout. Sam Longwood never stole anything in his entire life that didn't belong to him. Well, he had better start now. I know how we can get some horses. - We? - We. JOE KNOX: What do you mean we? - I mean we, us. - I'm coming with you. - Oh no, you're not. You've got to let me come, Sam. I wanna get square with Jack Colby as bad as you do. Oh, Sam. I know I've been a big disappointment to you, but men are just too romantic. I enjoy it. I aim to go on enjoying it. Soto hell with your ideals about young love. Now you wanna nail Jack Colby, I wanna cut his balls off. Am I in? Well, what about the horses? Well... There is one among us here who is professionally trained to ride into town and raise the operating capital that we need. You mean you want me to go in town... All for the good of the group, dearie. The fight's not until Saturday, that gives us three working days. And nights. Here is a list of the things we will need if you decide to go. Of course, we will cut you in on a percentage of everything we make. Won't we, Sam? Do you want me to go, Sam? Thursday, we know that you got your mind set on changing your ways, but surely it wouldn't hurt much if you'd put off being virtuous until after Saturday. Sam. Is something the matter, Sam? I mean, you're not in love with the little girl or anything like that, are you? Because if you are, - we wouldn't dream of... - I never said that, did I? Sam, one fast flop behind the bushes don't exactly mean... You watch that filthy mouth of yours, Nancy Sue. What if she should run into that Mike lady in town? You never thought of that, did you? I wouldn't worry none. Whores can be as clever as jaybirds when they wanna be. Let her go, Sam. It's the only way. The only way we can get the $60,000, Sam. Hello there. Who's that? Oh, sir, it's only me. I'm lost. Little girls are not supposed to be wandering around the streets in the middle of the night. Didn't your daddy ever tell you that? I never had no daddy. That's a hard break, kid. See, I got lost. I got frightened, and I fell, and I hurt my ankle. All little girls are supposed to have daddies to look after them. I know that. It's my ankle, sir. Yes, of course it is. You know, you're an awfully lucky girl to run across a grown man like myself at this hour instead of some of these hard cases we got around here. As a matter of fact, I've got a bit of liniment up in my room. It's just above here. Fix this up in no time at all. - I couldn't do that, sir. - What? I couldn't go to your room. I hardly know you. You're very sweet, but you're absolutely safe with me. What could possibly happen? Take my arm. Simply think of me as the daddy that you've never known. And here's the key to my room. The liniment is on the dressing table. I'll be along shortly to help you with the medication. Well, you're sure it's all right? I think it's going to be fine. Okay. - Good evening. - Good evening. You found it. Good. Are you sure this is for people? - It says "Horse" on it. - Trust me, my dear. Did you know that most daddies give their little girls presents when they're especially good? I want candy. Of course you do. $20 worth. $20 worth of candy? What are you gonna do with all that? I have a very sweet tooth. $20, that's more than they charge in the best house in Seattle for one or two or sometimes three. - For daddy's little Missy? Can't you afford $20? Well, I might be able to afford it, yes. I'm still curious though, what in the world do you do for it? I'll do my best, daddy. Sir, it's me, Vishniac. Not now. It's the champion's manager, sir. He's in the bar claiming that you've bet against me. It's not true, is it? No, of course not. It certainly is not true, no. Then you better come down to the bar right now, sir, because some of the fight patrons are getting a little steamed. Yeah. My dear, don't move a muscle now. Daddy will be right back. "John Jack Colby." "Dear... Daddy." I don't see why we're going to all this trouble. She ain't coming back. Gone back to whoring is what she done. Would you take a look at that? Must have been one hell of a night. Get everything, little one? Yep, 50lbs of salt and a pound of sugar. What about the shotgun shells? - Double "O" buck. - Good girl. You must have had a go with a lot of men. No, just one. Cartridges for you. Would you fetch that box for me? The box. For you. - For me? - Uh-huh. Now you mean to tell me that one man give you all this? Not exactly. You might just say I sort of helped myself. What are the bees for? They ain't bees. They're wasps. I caught 'em myself. Yeah? Let me see. What are they for? You are too inquisitive, little one. But soon you will be told. Hey... If one man give you all this, he must have had a name. Yes, he did. And he was a nice fella too. Nice fella by the name of... - Colby. - Jack Colby?! - You went with Jack? - I didn't say that. That filthy old man. Now he's two-timing me. Not with me he didn't, and that's the truth. - Then why did he give you the money? - He didn't, I borrowed it. - What? - I just bet you did. I wouldn't bet if I were you. 'Cause you see, miss smart ass, the I.O.U. I left had your name on it. JOE KNOX: Beer, cold beer, nice cold beer. Anybody want a cold beer? Drink it before it gets warm. Cold beer. Thank you very much, sir. Nice cold beer here. Cashing in. Hand me one of those empties, will you? MIKE: Get in there and fight, you sissies! MIKE: That's not fair! Come on! Need a new cash box. - Wasps! - Ow! Ow! Ow! What the hell? Where did they come from? Hyah! MAN: Worst fight I've ever... Hey, what the hell? I want my money back! - Hey! - What in the hell are you waiting for? It's Longwood! Come on! Turn her over. What in the... All right, $20 to any man that'll ride with me. 20 bucks! You bet I'll do it! Right away! Hyah hyah hyah! MIKE: Hold it! All right, let's go. Not that way! There are no roads up over that mountain. SAM: Joe Knox! Forget the pennies. Well, they got it all. Go now. Go! Hyah hyah hyah! Well, get out and push, you dummies! Push! Push! Push! NANCY SUE: Sam? How long we gonna walk these horses? Till they get their wind back. But Jack's gonna be right after us. He's gonna come after that money, Sam. You don't know him. I guess I know him all right. JOE KNOX: Sam, should we let 'em out? Slow and easy. Sam, look. It's Mike. Hadn't figured on her. You ladies get down and stay low. You're not going down there, you damn fool! These horses gotta be watered. Sam, what do these people want from you anyway? Her, they want her! Well, for god's sakes, give her to them. She's right, Sam. Colby's coming for sure. We could be dead centered of a crossfire if you don't. Sam, she might be worth the price of five horses, but she's not worth dying for. Hey, come back here. Mike, Mike! Here I am! - Here I am, Mike. - Go get her. COLBY: What are you doing up there? Picking flowers. - Like you picked my pocket? - Mm-hmm. What the hell are you doing? You come back with my machine, you damn car thief! All right, we're gonna follow 'em if it takes a week. So water 'em down good, boys. I wouldn't do that if were you, daddy. COLBY: Boys, hold it. Hold it. Why not? 'Cause they salted the water. Vishniac. Yeah, she's right, Mr. Colby. What kind of a dirty lowdown. Indian trick is that? I guess that's just about what it is. Yeah, I should have known. I think you should thank me, daddy. We can dispense with the daddy business. You see, by detaining you up there on that hill, likely I saved you from shooting your own wife. My wife helped those halfwits to rob me? I'm afraid so, Mr. Colby. Your wife has taken up with the Sam Longwood Bunch. The Sam what? Gotta be better than $60,000 here. Hey, Sam! Sam, we're rich. Joe... Joe Knox! - Stop. - Rich rich. Stop! Sam? Turn around. Here, turn around. Sam, where the hell do you think you're going? - Back. For the girl. I thought you said she didn't mean that much to you. Sam, can't you leave it a couple of weeks? What's two weeks? Is that gonna make a difference? Sam, you could get dead walking back in there alone. I ain't asking nobody to go with me. Who the hell said we were going to? I mean, just because Billy and I spent some time on the trail with you doesn't mean to say we're gonna stick our butts in the air for you, does it? Sam. Let him go. Hell! COLBY: Wet 'em down good, boys, fore and aft. We're gonna have to walk 'em back to town. Mr. Colby, over there. Boys, they're coming back. No no, Mr. Colby. It's your wife. Your wife. Don't shoot anybody. Don't shoot. Just hold your fire. - They come back for me... Sam! - Let's see how bad he wants you. - Jack, I want the girl. - I want my money. You owe us the money. Your wife for the girl. Now that's fair. Fair is what I say is fair, Sam. We've been through all this before, damn it. The answer's the same. I want my money. What are you gonna do now, Sam? Maybe this ain't such a good idea. We gonna hide behind women, Jack? Doesn't bother me none. Not a bad place to be. Why don't we punch it out? Just you and me like the old days. - Winner takes the pot. - Just you and me? Like the old days? Sam, I'd love to. - One condition, Jack. - Yeah, what's that? That win or lose, you get your wife back and I get the girl. - Otherwise I don't get my money back? - Right. - You got a deal. - Oh no, you don't. She's my property- Maybe we can do a little negotiating. Maybe we can. Sam, that's my money. Not yet it isn't. Cost me more than this just chasing after you. Damn it, that's enough. Not quite. Thanks for the ride, mister. My pleasure. If you ever decide to kidnap anybody else permanent... I'll bear it in mind. How are you feeling, my love? I see. About the same. Sam, looks like you're gonna have to use more than your hands. Look. Sam, for once in your life, why don't you do what Colby would do? You got the money. - You have got the girl. SAM: I gave my word. Sam? I want you to hold these for me for good luck. I expect there's no harm in smoothing out the odds a bit. I don't know. That son of a gun looks to be in pretty good shape to me. I got every confidence in you, Mr. Colby. I expect there's no harm in smoothing out the odds a bit. Mr. Vishniac, I want this to be a fair fight. And I want you to referee it. - Do you understand what I'm saying? - Yes, sir, Mr. Colby. No, you don't. All right, everybody. Leave your horse up there, come on down here and form a ring. We're gonna have a fight. Come on, let's go. Come on, ladies. Get down out of the car. All right, come on now. Move around here. Get in a circle. Gentlemen, I want a good clean fight. No butting, gouging, hitting below the belt. - What about kicking? Like that? - Mr. Colby, there is no kicking in this fight. I wanna tell you something, Jack. Win or lose, now I mean this, I ain't voting for William Howard Taft. Sam, we've had our little differences in the past, but you've always voted the straight Republican ticket. Yeah, well, I ain't voting for Taft. Sam, we're both Republicans. You're gonna vote the way you always have, Sam, which is Republican. - He didn't hurt you none, did he? - Huh-uh. Sam, hit him, Sam, hit him! Hit him... Sam, hit him. Sam, hit... hit him now! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him, Sam! - Which foot did he stomp on? - That one. NANCY SUE: Hit him, Sam! Hit him! Hit him, Sam. Hit him now! Come on, Sam! Get in there. Jack, Jack, down! Up up, down! Get up there! Sam, give it all... Hit him! Move it, move in and hit him, Sam. Sam, he's soft. He's just been sitting on top of all that money. - Sam, wait a minute. - Hit him, Sam! Sam, hit... It was worth it. What do you got in your hand, Jack? Bullets. What do you got? Your money. MAN: That's the way to do it, Mr. Colby. Come on now! MAN: Take him down! Get him! Great fight, Mr. Colby. He never saw it coming. Sam. VISHNIAC: Great fight, Mr. Colby. Well, I did it. I did it! And I got it back. And you've earned it, Mr. Colby. - Scalps! VISHNIAC: What? Scalps! You jackass! Didn't you check it? - Didn't you check it? - I... I... I thought I checked... I thought I checked it. I thought I checked it, but I didn't check it. No no no no, Joe Knox no got problem. Joe Knox... Oh, senor! I love my injun! Don't you worry about that Mike, woman none.
