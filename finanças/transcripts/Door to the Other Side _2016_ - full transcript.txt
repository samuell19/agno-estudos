Elinore: Night light, night bright, shine for me with all your might. Night light, night bright, watch over me 'til morning sight. You'll be safer here, Mr. scribbles. What's going on in here? Something's in my room. Oh, elinore... We should wake up daddy. No, you know he has to work early tomorrow. Sweetie, we can't do this tonight, okay? There's something here. There's nothing here. Don't you remember what the doctor said? There's no such thing as ghosts. The doctor's full of shit, wake up daddy! Okay. Show me. Where? All right, let me see the flashlight. Elinore, I don't see anything. Hey, what happened to Mr. scribbles? Elinore, did you take my brush? Oh! Elinore, help me! Elinore! Elinore! Elinore: Daddy, daddy, wake up! Well, fancy meeting you here, man. I was beginning to think that you were flaking... Nick: Tim? Tim? Hey, Tim, I didn't mean to scare ya. Okay. I'll come back later. Automated voice: You have reached the office of Dr. piccault. No one is available to take your call at the moment. If this is an emergency, please hang up and dial 9-1-1. Otherwise, leave a message and we'll be in touch as soon as we can. Thank you and have a good day. No, no, oh... Nick: Hey! Twice in one week, I might have to call CNN. Yeah, so I was wondering where that was. I'm just gonna go knock it out now, if that's okay? So, I guess you can just give it to me since I'm here. You know, I got a couple minutes. Why don't you just tell me what's on it? Well, it's the beginning of the week, um, so let me guess. I'm gonna go with tp, ultra soft of course... And... Mouthwash. Okay. Uh... It was nice talking to you too, and we should definitely do this again when I get back. Thank you. Yes? Distorted voice: You can't hide anymore. Excuse me, who is this? We regret to inform you, you have 45 days to vacate. How do you know that? What's going to happen when you have to go outside again? Nothing. Nothing never happens. Something bad always does. Not this time. I can do it. That's not what she thinks. Who? Turn around. Carri? Distorted voice: Ask her what's going to happen. No. Leave me alone. You are, but not for long. Mary: Tim? It's Mary, can you hear me? Tim? Mary? Yes, couldn't you hear me? Uh, no, no, I didn't. Strange, I could hear you. Sorry, I thought it was a prank. Is everything okay? Dr. piccault missed the appointment today. I know, I'm sorry I couldn't call you sooner. There's no easy way to say this... Dr. piccault had an accident. Accident, what kind of accident? Tim, I need you to stay calm. It's okay if you want to take some medication. Is he going to be okay? Well, we're not sure at this point. You've been transferred to a new doctor for the time being. New doctor, no, no, no, I can't. Tim, we just want you to be calm. Can you do that, or should I send some help? Tim... Tim? No, you don't need to send anyone. What's important is that we have a new doctor for you, okay? What's his name? Dr. sephton. Tim: But I don't know him. Mary: Dr. piccault has worked with him before, he's excellent. His office is going to call you, but I wanted you to hear it from me first. Tim: Sure, okay. Nick: Oh, wake up, man, please don't be dead. Nick: Tim! Tim: Whoa, how did you get in here? I came back with the thing, and the thing is like this, and you're laying here not breathing! Man, I was gonna call 9-1-1! Excuse me, I have to... Would you mind locking up when you leave? Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to snoop. Um, I should probably get going. I forgot to, uh, give you your money. Oh... deliveries on me, get me next week. Do you need any... Any help? I mean, with the letter. No, thank you, though. How long have you lived here? Almost 20 years. And when was the last time you, like, went past that door? Thirteen months. Do you miss the outside world, just a little? I can see it from here. Do you ever get lonely? No. I would. I mean, I don't think we're supposed to be alone. Do you? All right, well, I'll see you next week. Automated voice: We're sorry, please consult your directory and dial again. Nick: Tim? Hey, hey, hey it's Nick. Tim. Tim, it's Nick. Tim: Earthquake? Yeah, what did you think that was? That can't be right. Why... why not? Did you see anybody else? Do you mean besides me and you? No I, I thought I heard something, like growling, but... Oh, yeah, Brett's dog got loose. Brett's your neighbor and he can't keep his dog on a leash. Dog? Yeah. I'm not crazy. Oh, no. Who's saying anything about crazy? A little buzzed up, maybe. Did you, uh, open this tonight? I had one glass. Well, I don't think the bottle would re-seal itself after the, uh, the wine leaked out. Look, man, I'm not passing judgment. If I was you and I got that letter, I'd be pretty freaked out too. Oh, there you go. Well, I guess I'm gonna head out, um... You're okay, right? Yeah. I could use some help. I mean, with the letter. If you haven't found anything better to do with your free time. How do you feel about having some company over? Nick: You know, Joan, I'm glad you talked me into helping with him. You ready to head to his place? Shouldn't you be helping me? Okay, I'm here, let's just talk about this for a second. I think I took it out too soon. You didn't. What if he has allergies? He doesn't. What if he doesn't like it? He will. What if he doesn't like me? He probably doesn't even like me, so it'll make two of us. All right, nervous Nelly, what did you do with my girlfriend this time? I am not nervous Nelly. Okay, you're not. He's been living an anchoritic lifestyle, and I don't want to be the reason he regrets his decision. Is that even a word? Reclusive. Okay. The food's perfect, you're perfect, and he's gonna wish he did this six months ago. You think so? Absolutely. All right, what do you want me to do? Tupperware? Yeah. How you doing over there? Joan: Good, just sauteing the garlic. You're not gonna eat that, are you? Mmm, nice! Is that the stuff with the sesame, the, uh, the bernero? Cavolo nero, also called Kale. Oh, this looks really good. Thanks. Joan: You don't like it, do you? My wife used to make Kale. Oh, uh, I hope I didn't... No, they're just, um, something th... I'm her... uh, I'm sure hers was much better. Couple episodes of top chef doesn't make me erudite. Nick: Okay, that's not a word. I'm just saying. Really, now? It's a word. Yeah, I don't think so. What do you think? Means, um, having great knowledge. Joan: Thank you. Okay, merriam Webster, I'd like you to meet encyclopedia britannica. I knew that one. Yeah, right. What? Nothing. So, that animus earlier about the food situation. Seems like wasted energy. Did you just use "animus" in a sentence? I did, and correctly, and I kinda think you want to make out with me right now. You think three syllables is all it takes? I think it's a pretty good start. I'm not that easy. You're gonna have to come up with something bigger. Oh, you don't think I can? I'd like to see you try. A star? Batman. Oh! Yeah, you're not gonna get this one either. That was a terrible Batman. That was the Batman. Mmm... Peace sign? Whoa, look at you, one for two, huh? It's so sad. Are you still thinking about that? He was married, had a family. Now he's all alone. Not if we can help it. Can we? Yeah. Look what we just did. Go to sleep, all right? Okay. Joan: Nick? Nick? Oh, my god! Nick, Nick! What's going on? Something's grabbed my arm! What do you mean? Something's grabbed my arm! Nick: What? Whoa! Is there... is there somebody in there? I don't know. Get back, get back, get back. You gotta be kidding me. What? It's the luggage. You just had a bad dream, and you were sleepwalking. We both know that's nothing new for you. This was real. No, it wasn't. It seemed like it was real, but it wasn't. You thought someone was in there. That's because you did! Look, we just had an earthquake, all that stuff got tossed around and it fell. That's it. Can I have some wine, please? How about a hug, can I have a hug? Can I get a kiss? No. Tim doesn't know we were working with Dr. Piccault, now with you. Well, I don't think it's a good idea to change that, especially since you made, what sounds like, pretty good progress. I know you've consulted with Dr. piccault in the past. So, do you think Tim's case is more my area of expertise? I think your expertise is a perspective that can only help. And what does Dr. piccault think? He felt that Tim was a unique case. You do know that a vast majority of the cases have nothing to do with the paranormal? I mean, have there been events that point to the paranormal? Joan: No. Well, it's basic. You have Sage to burn, or osha? Elinore? Elinore! Dr. sephton: Look, I know an abrupt change in therapist can seem overwhelming. So let's just start slow, and we'll build from there. There's this feeling, rolling around in the back of my head. I can't quite place it. And it never seems to go away either. Kind of like dread, maybe. Existential dread is common in cases like yours. I'm not so sure about the existential part. So, you believe in destiny? I believe decisions are mine to make. Like going outside? You decide it. Yes. What if you had been locked out? It didn't occur to me. Consciously. Anyway, still not sleeping well at night? Bad dreams? Yes. Being evicted is traumatic for anyone. For you, it's bound to wreak havoc with your subconscious. Manifesting your dreams. And sometimes, I'm awake. I'm not at all puzzled that you're having anxiety attacks. I... I feel like things are really happening that I know can't be. Anxiety, and phobia, fear, stress, panic are all rooted in the unconscious mind. And they can project themselves in many ways, whether you are awake or asleep. So it's normal? Normal for you may not be normal for someone else. But this is a good starting point. Hey. Well, I figured the sooner we started, the sooner we can finish. I'm not ready. You're gonna have to come outside eventually. So I think we should just peel the band-aid off, okay? Can you do me a favor? I want you to look at me right here, that's the bull's-eye right there, okay? Give me your hands. Come on, I'm not gonna bite you, give me your hands. You can do it. That's it. Okay, all right, okay. I just want you to put one foot in front of the other, just take one step. Just like when you were a kid, just give me one step. All right, now give me another one. That's it. Okay, come on. Watch the step here, give me one more. Okay? Come on, that's it. One more. You can do it, one more. Look at the bull's-eye, one more. You're outside. You did it. One... Hello? Distorted voice: Joan can't help you. Help you. What about her? You leave her alone. Distorted voice: She doesn't know what I know. What? Hindsight hasn't taught you anything. Hey. What are you doing back there? I don't know that one. Ow, not so hard. Ow! Stop... Oh, come on. Oh, come on, come on. You got me. Well, how did you two end up together? Well, she has pretty good taste, and I've got pretty good luck. Mmm. Yeah, she reminds me of my wife, uh, carri. Oh, how'd you meet her? Uh, a styx concert, uh, she passed me a joint. No way, stoned at a styx concert? Any other way to see styx in 1979? Well, I guess not. What happened to her? Oh! I'm... I'm sorry, man, I didn't... Oh no, no it's okay, I've had more than enough therapy, it's just... After, uh, my wife was taken, um, my daughter, elinore... Hit her hard. I didn't know you had a daughter. Yeah, after my wife, well, elinore... Um... Well, she ran away. I don't blame her. I wasn't exactly fit. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You're getting there. Didn't mean to be a buzz kill. No. Uh... Uh... I'm probably going to turn in. Oh, yeah, right, um... Do you mind if I crash? Sleep? Here? Yeah. Joan and I, we kind of got into it earlier and I just need some space. Okay. Thanks, man. Goodnight. What are you doing? There's something in my room. What? Now? Tim! Tim! Tim? Tim. Tim, Tim. What the fuck are you doing in here? Tim. Can you hear me? Tim, wake up, are you... What the... Tim, wake up, Tim, Tim... Jesus. Are you all right? And? Nothing. Nothing was there. Makes me feel stupid just talking about it. Has he ever mentioned seeing anything? What do you mean? What kind of things? He's having severe anxiety attacks, right? Which is why I like to give him a sleep test. Something very simple. You know, just to be able to rule things in or out. I would call someone and have them come to him. You think you could get him to go for that? Anna: This is the easiest test you'll ever take. All you have to do, is sleep. What's this for? Oh, really basic. It remotely monitors heart-rate activity. That... that's all you need to tell? Oh, no. This is just a simple way to see if we need to do a full exam. Okay. Snoring a problem for you? Depends on who's doing it. You know, I don't mean to be difficult, but I'm not tired. Me neither. How about we chat a bit? Tim: I have a song. Anna: Okay. Tim: It's from when I was a kid. Joan: Anna! Nick: You see? I don't think he's breathing. See, this is what I was telling you about. Nick: Luke, I am your father. Did you see that movie? Yeah. Yeah, do you like science fiction? I do, yeah. I'm a big geek that way, let me just see this for a second. Is that too tight? That's okay, it feels okay? So that's it, it's sleep apnea? Well, the c-pap should be effective, but I'll be honest... This is definitely outside of the realm of normal. Even for a sleep apnea. We need to run a full examination on him. You're good at picking up on things. What do you think it is? We know, through scientific research that the cerebellum is the part of the brain that reduces dreams. It's the very seat of our unconscious mind. Phobias, repressed feelings, darkened thoughts. The unconscious mind is a powerful repository for them all. So is it that much of a leap to theorize that paranormal phenomena would manifest itself there first, when we sleep? Now you have quietly led us all down this path. Why don't you tell me what's really going on? Mmm. Tim? How did you get here by yourself? It's not that far. What are you doing? I wanted to say something. Are you awake? Does that change anything? I don't know. Have you ever done anything that at the time seemed like a good thing at hindsight proved you wrong? Yes. Hindsight. Sorry, I liked you. Nick: I guess I can take him back in the morning. Do you want to talk about before? Look, you said that things were evolving. Well, maybe they are. But I'm not letting you do this by yourself. Whatever happens, we're in this together. You have anything to say about that? What if the sleep clinic doesn't work out? Why wouldn't it work out? It's a simple question, Nick. Why don't we deal with that if we have to? Look, it's been a long day. Why don't you get some sleep? Aren't you coming? No, I better keep an eye on him. I'll be okay, you go ahead. Anna: He should be dead. Normal, then an erratic beat, then here. This is a massive fibrillation. And then... He's... his heart just stops. Joan: You mean a heart attack? No, that's not what a heart attack looks like. Can sleep apnea cause it? Apnea causes a lack of oxygen, which can cause your heart to stop. So, how come, if he has apnea, he's not already dead? It's rare. Most of the time, people wake up when they can't breathe. Then go back to sleep. Just like you wake up when you have to go to the bathroom. People can drift in and out of apnea all night and never really get a night's sleep. Well, how long can someone live after their heart stops? In this scenario, three or four minutes. But it was stopped for longer. If he wasn't dead, I don't know how he could be alive. Especially with no brain damage, no side effects. Joan: How does that happen? That's what we're gonna find out tomorrow night. Shall we? So, you're both free, and Jonathan too? Nick: Mmm-hmm. Joan: Yep. Nick: So, how does this work? We sold him on coming here, but Tim's been asking me a lot of questions. We wire him to more advanced diagnostic programs that monitor brain functioning. Eeg, emg, and then the data's transferred back to my office computer. So he just sleeps here? He just sleeps here. We can hear him through a two-way intercom monitor, so if he needs anything, he just lets us know. Look, I've done this more times than I can count. There's nothing to be worried about. Well, thanks, doc. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, see you soon. Joan: Did you tell him? Nick: Yeah, I did. Joan: How long is he gonna hide in there? Maybe he'd like to come down here and explain what's going on. Nick: You know, Joan, this agro-attitude is not gonna help. Do you know anything about what happened to Anna? Nick said she had an accident. Joan: Besides that? No, how could I? So much for your test. Pretty bad timing for you, right? Bad timing for Anna too. She comes in, tries to help and something happens to her. What about your wife? You don't remember anything? I was asleep when it happened. That's it? That's your story, sleeping while your wife dies? Of a stroke, right? Did she scream for help? I don't know what you want me to say. How about the truth, for starters? You must have heard her scream something, why can't you remember? Hey, hey, hey, hey. We're all on the same team, right? I'm sorry. Hey, whoa, where are you going? Wait, wait, where you... Where are you going? She's just a little strung out. Dr. Andre: This is Dr. Andre piccault to patient Tim liston, October 13th. I've gotten very close to Tim in recent months and I've had a breakthrough. When Tim sleeps, he experiences an apnea state. Uh, something supernatural manifests. It's like he becomes like a bridge, uh, that allows him to cross over. Tim. Tim, what are you doing? There's something in here. You can hear it, listen, right now. Bad things always happen, I'm sorry I lied to you. What happened to Dr. piccault? He's in a coma. Why do you have this? You, and Dr. piccault, and Dr. sephton. Just one big lab rat, aren't I, buddy? No, no, you're taking this the wrong way. Does it even matter? Do you see what's happening right now? Matters to me. Yes. In the beginning, it was work. We could have left at any point, and we didn't because of you and how we felt about you. Tim: That supposed to make me feel better? Yeah, it should. I put myself out there for you. Now we're all in, all three of us. You're not afraid to go outside, are you? You're afraid of what happens when someone comes in. That's why you don't have any family... Or friends... Or anyone. You knew. No, I coped. Why? Why didn't you say something, or do something? You could have stopped it. Stop something I'm not aware of? I've been through therapy, drugged up, institutionalized, harassed by police. What else is there besides being alone? Okay. What do we know? There's this thing, this dread. And when you go to sleep, this apnea happens and you become a bridge for it. I don't want to be a bridge anymore. Nick: So how do we blow up the bridge? Jonathan would know. So what do we do in the meantime? We just gotta keep you breathing. I'm taking first watch. Nick... Nick, Nick! Nick: What? What, what, what? Tim: She's right in front of me, Nick! Where? Who? She's right in front... Do something! Where, where, where? Anna, she's right there! I don't see her, where is she? There, there, there! There's nothing there, there's nothing there, man, there's nothing there! Tim: Bad things always happen, I'm sorry I lied to you. Mmm. I... I don't know what to say. How about you can help us? Look, this... You've got to understand that there's no precedent for this. Maybe a few days. Days? We're not gonna make it a few more days. Yes, I need time to work through this, process it... How much time do you think we have? I have no idea. I just don't want to end up like what you just showed me. I won't let that happen to Nick. Not because of you or me. You should have thought about that before you started this. Hey. What did Jonathan say? Did you get any sleep? No, not really. What did he say? You do look tired, are you okay? Oh, yeah, I'm fine. Nick, I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. I should have listened to you sooner. I'll stay with Tim tonight. No, that's on me. Nick, I can do it, it's okay. I don't want you over there with him. All I have to do is keep him awake. No. It doesn't matter if I'm here or there. You said we'd take shifts. I'll start tonight and when you get some sleep you can come over. All right. I'll set my alarm for midnight. What did Jonathan say? He said tomorrow he'd have a plan. Oh. Oh, shoot. Joan: Hey, it's Joan. Leave a message. What? Daddy, daddy, wake up! Daddy! Bad dream. I have something for you. Mmm. Mr. scribbles. You forgot him when you left. You knew? I never stopped thinking about you. I never stopped caring about you. Elinore. Never really was an eviction, was there? You needed a little push. And Dr. piccault? Getting him to take you on was the real challenge. I wanted to come back sooner, I'm sorry it took me so long. No. I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you. I don't blame you. I hope you know that. I do. I'm glad. I wish I could have been stronger... No, no, no, no, no, no. You're stronger now. So beautiful. Proud of you. Carri: Help me! Help! Where did this come from? I found it at Tim's. A lot of these seem like they're Latin, like quorum, quota... Now here's one, "quotidian". Recurring daily. Huh. I'm not keeping you up, am I? Mmm-mmm. Okay.
