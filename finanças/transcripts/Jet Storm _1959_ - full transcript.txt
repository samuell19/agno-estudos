Pay the driver, Ernest. Nice day for a flight, sir. Yes, very nice. Oh, it all looks pretty steady up as far as here. Do you think it will hold out until tonight? Yeah, I think so. Don't be shy, you're in the right place. Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet somebody new to the Atlantic route. Mr. Whitman, our engineer. -Hello. -Michaels, our radio officer. Mr. Saunders, our navigator and Captain Bardow. This is Miss Pamela Leyton. Pleasure to meet you, Captain Bardow. Nice to have you with us, Miss Leyton. I'm sure I speak for Mr. Gilbert, too. You certainly do. And, captain, do you think she's a bit young to be in on this kind of a session? [scoffs] I think she'll be all right. [bell dinging] WOMAN [on PA]: Will passengers on Flight 101... 101, that's us. Oh, dear, come on, Jeremy. Oh, Jeremy, can't you eat anything without getting it all over you? Come on now, come on. Go to Daddy. WOMAN [on PA]: Passengers on flight 101, London to New York, -please proceed to... -Here he comes. -Get over to Channel Three. -Right. How about a statement? What about when you get back? [indistinct chatter] Are you gonna be on TV when you're over there, Billy? Say, what are you going to do? There are important passengers on our flight. But we're going some place where there's sunshine, that's for sure. MAN: There's lots of sunshine in Hollywood. So, there's sunshine in Honolulu, too. So you're going to Honolulu, Billy? We're thinking about it. Are you going to take your guitar, too? It's in the baggage compartment. It's traveling alone. The guitar takes Billy, that's our ticket. Get him on the tarmac. We'll be able to hitch up with a hundred mile an hour jet stream up there. It's all pretty rough below there. We'll be able to drop in on Santa Claus, and see what he's got us for Christmas. So it'll be upstairs all the way, 35,000 feet at least. Any questions? No? Let's go. [engine humming] A hundred and twenty-- Jeremy, you're costing Daddy enough money already on this trip. -All right, Victor. -Come on. How long will you be in the States, Billy? -We're not sure. -Are you going to make any professional appearances while you're there? We got one or two engagements lined up. But it's mostly our honeymoon. We haven't really had one yet, you know. -We're starting now. -Good luck. Thank you. Billy Forrester. Am I supposed to have heard of him? 'Cause I haven't. Well, you will. He's very big with the teenagers. Makes a fortune. [whistling] Any Zulu chiefs on that passenger list? [chuckles] Not a one. What's a Zulu chief? Or am I too young to know? [chuckles] No. The old man and me never had a bad trip, except once. We had two Zulu chiefs on board. Real ones, with spears and lions' manes and lots of trouble. And ever since then, everyone knows that one Zulu chief equals one bad motor. Then there must have been before the jet age. Wait a minute, I want to see if there are any friends of mine on that list of yours. WOMAN [whispering]: What do you think you're doing? MAN [whispering]: Come on. WOMAN [on PA]: KLA announce the arrival of flight #246 from Athens. Thank you. Through there. Thank you very much. Whose photograph is that, Ernest? Ernest. It's nothing Carol, nothing. Is that someone you know? I've never seen him before. Then why are you staring at him then? -Oh, am I? -Yes, you are. -Thank you, madam. -Oh, thank you. [bell dinging] You've been a good wife to me, Carol. Have been? I hope I still am. WOMAN [on PA]: Will all passengers please proceed to Customs, channel three. MAN: Big smile now. Hold it... In my opinion, they're taking photos of the wrong people. I beg your pardon? I'm an old time fan of yours, even before TV. Speaking as one old-timer to another, I'm glad it's them going through all that and not me. [chuckles] Get closer, closer. Hold it. [indistinct chatter] Oh, Ernest! MAN: Everyone aboard now, please. Oh, Ernest, I thought I'd lost you. Oh, I was just looking at the plane. Come on. -Bad luck, young man. -How do you like that? I've been making eyes at her for ten minutes and she goes and sits next to a perfect stranger. Never even looked at each other before. You can't trust women nowadays. In my days, a wink was respected. Hey, let's you and me make her burn with jealousy. [chuckles] May I join you, madam? Certainly, but you won't find it much fun, I'm getting on. Ah, not a day over 52, honestly. A shameless flatterer. I have a birthday next week that would put Methuselah to shame. Impossible. I'll tell the truth. The birthday was last week. Furthermore, I'm a widow twice and my daughters are all grandmothers themselves. Charming, absolutely charming. May I introduce myself? I'm Binky Meadows, bachelor. Mrs. Emma Morgan. I know your name, young man, very well indeed. Oh. [chuckles] -Oh, sorry. -Mr. and Mrs. Randolf? -Yes. -For the present. Don't pay any attention to him, he's high. In fact, I don't think I'm really going to need a plane. Come on. London Tower, this is Macair Golf Alpha Juliet Oscar Romeo, taxi clearance over. MAN [on radio]: Macair Golf Alpha Juliet Oscar Romeo, London Tower. You are clear to taxi to the holding point. Runway two-eight-right. Wind two seven-zero degrees, ten knots out. Hydraulic pressure and quantity? Check. Emergency break? Check. -Recharge and valve on? -Check. -Doors and security lights? -Check. -Happy? -Huh? -I said are you-- -Very. London Tower, this is Golf Oscar Romeo ready for take off. MAN [on radio]: Macair Golf Oscar Romeo you are clear for immediate. Can I help you, sir? I'm sorry, sir, but it's the rule. It's all right. I'll see to it. Thank you. Please, Ernest. [engine revs] Your throttles. V-one. V-two. Billy, what's a Siamese delicacy in four letters? Girl? Oh, you rat. Ow! Oh, Billy, stop. Well, you started it. I should not be so inquisitive, but I've worked with this man. -Please forgive me. -That's all right. I've been reading over your shoulder, too. You're a doctor from the United Nations, right? Yes, malaria control. My name is Doctor Jacob Bergstein. Colonel John Coe. Oh, a military man. Well, 'til about seven months ago, actually. I've just been retired from the US Army. Getting used to the idea of being a civilian again. I'm very please to know you. Mrs. Tracer. Mrs. Tracer, here's the blanket. He's already asleep. Sorry. We gave him a pill. I guess we ought to introduce ourselves. I'm Alan Mulliner. How do you do? I don't know your name. -Miss Barrington. -You must have a first name. Yes, I have. Several, in fact. Whiskey, please. Make that two, and all on the one tab, of course. -Anything else I can get you? -No, thank you. Oh, I seem to have lost a husband. He's gone down to the lounge deck. Oh, thank you. How about you, old boy? All right, if I can buy the next one. What's the difference? It's all the one party, isn't it? -Hello. -Oh, hello. Come on in. What are you having? All right? Yes, thank you very much. -From the top of the list? -Anywhere you say. First, carpets and curtains. You looking for something? I thought I had some sleeping tablets here. What do you want tablets for? Let me get you a scotch. It's not that I mind flying, it's just that I haven't had a good sleep for a week. Well, a couple of scotches will do that for you. No, thanks. [indistinct radio chatter] Mind the shop, your father's going to put his feet up. Happy dreams, Daddy. Oh, dear, what a dream. [chuckles] Ernest, I dreamt I fell out of a tree. Haven't you have a nap at all, Ernest? No, I haven't. You've been asleep for two and a half hours. No! We'll be in the States before we know it. When do we get to New York? I don't know. I didn't notice. It's been very smooth so far, hasn't it? We're not there yet, Carol. Oh, Ernest, really. Don't be so morbid, please. -Are you so afraid? -Afraid of flying? Afraid of dying? Of course, I am. I like being alive. You really like living in this senseless, this heartless world? Some of it is not so heartless. What is it Ernest? If they should get just one hint of disaster, how they'd panic. Then you'd see show much heart they had for each other. Just one hint. Heartless! Why should there be one hint of disaster? Why should you-- Ernest, this man that you were staring at the airport. Does he have anything to do with what you're saying? Is he James Brock? -James Brock? Yes. -Are you absolutely sure? I've waited for this moment for two years. Ernest, listen-- And now I've got him where he can't get away. Ernest, you mustn't do anything that will hurt you later. Oh, I'll tell you what's going to happen to him, Carol. He's going to die. He's going to die... sooner than he thinks. And for that matter it wouldn't hurt the rest of them to offer up a few prayers for their corrupt souls. He's crackers. He's definitely round the bend. [gasps] This man in front seems to be threatening to-- Well, to do in somebody or other. Sounds like. Do in somebody? We can't have that sort of thing, can we? After all, it definitely wasn't advertised, was it? [chuckles] No, I'll tell the captain at once. I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to anybody. No, no. Good. Would you like a cup of tea, Mrs. Morgan. A large martini with just a wink of vermouth, and bring one for Mr. Meadows, as well. Two of our best, coming up. Will that be all, miss? Oh, watch out, what you're doing! So sorry. Well, a lot of good that's going to do. This is an expensive dress. I'm terribly sorry. Can I pay for the cleaning? Oh, forget it, forget it. -I'm Mrs. Lilian Satterly. -My name's Barrington. Look, if there's anything I can do-- Inez Barrington. I thought I recognized you. I saw your picture in Vogue when you announced your engagement to that Italian prince. Cassino, was it? What a catch! It never came off, did it? No, it never came off. Oh, all those lovely millions he was supposed to have. Let's face it, Lilian, a million lire is not quite the same as a million pounds or dollars, is it? Oh, I see, what good's a title if he can't bring home the old necessary? Exactly. Martin, my husband, poor soul, always said-- -He passed away two months ago. -I'm sorry. Oh, don't be sorry, dear. He was nearly 78. I gave him a good life, everything he wanted, everything I had. I was only 21 when he first came after me. We lived together for 28 years. It wasn't exactly beautiful, but we were very comfortable. -Excuse me. -You were too young, too, dear. Perhaps what happened was just as well. Perhaps, but I really must be going. Yes, I'm coming up, too, dear. Mrs. Tilley, the captain sends his compliments and asks if you would mind having a word with him in the lounge deck? -He wants to talk to me? -Please. I'll be right back. Mrs. Tilley, I'm sorry to trouble you. Yes. -A cigarette? -No, thank you. -Do you mind? -No, please do. Mrs. Tilley, it's been reported to me that someone overheard your husband speak threateningly about another passenger. Is that so? Yes, you see-- It's rather difficult to explain. Is-- is your husband ill? No, no, not really. Well, he did spend some time at a rest home last year. That's where we met. I was a nurse before we got married. I see. What was wrong with him? A nervous disorder, a breakdown. -A mental breakdown? -No, a nervous break-- What are you getting at, Captain Bardow? I'm not getting at anything, Mrs. Tilley. I have been told that one man here threatened another. The safety of all the passengers is my responsibility. It is your duty to help me if you can. Please, go on. Well, you see, my husband had a child. A little girl from his first marriage. Two years ago, the child was killed by a hit and run driver. Ernest went mad with grief. You've only got to look at him. He isn't even 40 yet. Yes, I understand. Please continue. Um... he was obsessed by revenge. He left his job and went looking for the driver. Finally, he did find out who it was, through a detective agency. They couldn't prove it, but they were certain that the man they found was guilty. And this man is on our plane? Do you know his name? Yes, a Mr. James Brock. Yes, it all adds up now. What adds up, Mrs. Tilley? That's why Ernest was so strange last week. Why we had to go on a holiday so suddenly. What did your husband threaten? What were his actual words? He said that Brock was going to die sooner than anybody thought. I'll get you a drink, Mrs. Tilley. Thank you. Mr. Brock. Yes? What, uh-- What do you want? I'm... Ernest Tilley. [chuckles] I've never heard of you, old man. It's two years and three weeks today. [laughing] Are you drunk or something? Why don't you go back to your seat. [winding sound] -[toy rattling] -[laughing] We've got a lunatic aboard. He's right. I am a lunatic. He made me so. He killed my daughter. -Steward! Steward! -[buzzing] This man drove up on the curb and killed my daughter. A seven-year-old baby. She was holding this bird in her hand. I'd given it to her on her birthday. He drove up on the curb... drunk. He drove away, he didn't stop. He just drove away with a blonde who was with him. Look, why don't you go back to your seat. I don't know you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm no hit and run driver. I never killed your daughter or anybody else. Now, look, go off on back to your seat. Stewardess, please get this man away. He's molesting us. Molesting you, Mrs. Brock? By the time this trip's over, he'll be on his knees to me, begging for his life. He's a raving madman. I've never seen him before. Come, Mr. Tilley, you must go back to your seat. James Bellington Brock, Chairman of Wilmington Mills, branches in Birmingham, Milan, New York. Here's the proof. I know, but you really must come back to your seat now, please. It took two years to find him. It wasn't me. I'm very sorry about what's happened to you, but you've got me mixed up with somebody else. You're going to die, Mr. Brock. You're time is up. He may be armed. Yes, and I'm not going to be any sitting duck. Get the captain. I'll get him at once. Now, please don't worry. She's telling me not to worry. James, was there a blonde woman in the car? Don't be so ridiculous. That's crazy. It's all right, dear. I understand. Don't be so damned understanding, Rose, the man's a lunatic, I tell you. Yes, that's right, he was only threatening. I mean, if he was going to do anything he would have done it by now. Psychiatrists don't know what a lunatic will do, but you do, eh? -I'm only trying to help. -I don't want your help. I hate hit and run drivers, don't you Otis? Loathe and detest them, Edwina. I wonder how he's going to do it? -How who's going to do what? -Kill him. Oh, he's just trying to throw a scare into the slob. But you're wrong, Otis. He will do it. It's simply a question of how. Could a bullet hole up here make the plane blow up or anything? No, but the air would rush out 'cause we're pressurized. -It's called decompression. -That's right, decompression. -How bad is that? -It's not particularly good. Well, we're over 40,000 feet. Could be pretty rough 'til we get down. These new planes have automatic oxygen masks, they open automatically as soon as the pressure drops. Well, I never expected to see Binky Meadows with a sad face. Oh, I was just working it out. I'm in direct line of fire. You've too much imagination, young man. Oh, no, Brock won't get it, I will. Look, if a flock of pigeons flies overhead, -I'm the one they never miss. -[giggling] I was once nearly killed by a jealous lover for being the boyfriend of a girl I'd never even met. All the pain and none of pleasure. And during the war I was wounded twice... by our side. You must accentuate the positive, Binky. Oh, I do. I'll positively get shot. What sort of a crew have they got here allowing such things to go on? They can't help who gets on the plane, can they? I don't know. That lunatic's still sitting over there. Nobody's even spoken to him yet. In a situation like this the captain ought to show himself, at least. What's he doing? He's just flying the plane for kicks. If you just sit there being wise, that will get you a nice pew in Heaven. Look, why don't you write it all down and send a letter to the company, eh? Passengers have their rights. We ought to form a committee; take it up with the captain. A committee. Yes, that might be a very good idea. My name is George Towers. I'm Lilian Satterly. I'm very glad to know you, Miss Satterly. -Mrs. I'm a widow. -Oh! Are you American? Well, I was born in Canada, but I like the English. I do a lot of business in your country. I'm glad we've got some real men aboard. It makes me feel better. Yes, of course. That man's cracking up, you know. He's liable to hurt somebody. That's right. And it might be you. Yes, but suppose he has a gun. He probably has. Colonel, I heard you say you were an American officer. Now don't you think we ought to do something? Do what, Mr. Brock? If a gun goes off at this altitude, it's everybody's problem, you know? This man's a lunatic. I'm not thinking of my own safety, but there are women aboard this plane. That's a touching thought, Mr. Brock. Who's asking you? Now, look, it's-- It's everybody's safety I'm thinking of. There are Americans aboard this plane, too, you know. If there were a British officer here, he'd know his duty. Would you mind taking your hand off? -Listen, you've got a-- -Please. James. All right, have it your own way. You'll see. He's got troubles. I suppose that one should not judge without evidence, but it seems to me a face without humanity. Nor remorse. He's just frightened of getting killed. I know the type. He's one of the buyers of this world. Buys anything: love, shoes-- I don't think he'll buy himself out of this, do you? Miss Barrington, maybe you'd better change your seat in case there's any trouble. We're a bit near the center of action here. I'm all right, thank you. -But it might be safer if you-- -I understand. That accent of yours, I can't quite place it. Are you English? I really don't think you ought to bother about me. Well, there's one thing I know you aren't, and that's friendly. But supposing he has got a gun, what do we do? Nothing. Oh... we can't sit here and watch a man being killed in front of our eyes. It is wrong. It's not wrong, just illegal. We are civilized people. We are traveling in one of civilization's finest achievements. We live by law and order. The captain is the law on this plane. He's the only one with authority to act. Do you think we ought to change Jeremy's seat? VICTOR: Nothing's going to happen. WOMAN: How can you be sure? If he were going to do anything, he would have done it instead of saying he was going to do it. No need to get upset, dear. I was merely asking. All right, let's move him over to our seat. Oh, perhaps if we move him he'll wake up. Well, let's leave him where he is. Nothing, absolutely nothing is going to happen. When you become very positive, Victor, it's usually because you're not. Oh, that's very interesting. Very psychological. Well, I do know you fairly well by now, Victor. Just an open book to you, is that it? I know when you're lying and when you're telling the truth. When have I ever lied to you? Oh, everyone lies once in a while. -When have I lied to you? -Once in a while. -Just give me one instance. -Oh, it's a silly argument. Don't let him upset you, James. I tell you, he can't do a thing. [indistinct radio chatter] Hello. Hello. What's the news up here? What's the news back there? Captain's talking to Mr. Tilley now. Oh, that will be all right. He'll straighten it out. He always does. The only time he was stopped a little was when the two Zulus rode with us. Pam, wait a minute. I want to ask you something. Are you as impressed with me as I am with you? Can I have a little time to think of the right answer? Sure. Tell me over dinner tonight in New York. -We having dinner tonight? -Club 21. Oh, I'd love to, but I promised my brother and sister-in-law I'd have dinner with them. That's fine. You bring yours, I'll bring mine. Have you got a brother and sister-in-law -in New York, too? -Yes, I've got several. Michaels, radio New York, will you? Club 21, table for 18. Idiot. There's no doubt in your mind that Brock is the man? It was Brock. That he covered up his trail with bribery. He got away with it-- He got away from the law, not from me. Now you're planning to be a law unto yourself? Look, Mr. Tilley, a few years ago, my wife fell down the length of a staircase and broke her back. She died as a result. Well, I kept looking around for someone to blame to get rid of my feelings of hate and guilt. Since then, I've brought up two children. They're my whole life. So I've got a pretty good idea of how you're feeling. If I was appointed executioner of you child's slayer, I'd do it... with pleasure. Do you know what I'm trying to say, Mr. Tilley? Mr. Tilley, I want you to give me your word that you will do nothing on this plane... ...use no violence or threats. I'm waiting for your word, Mr. Tilley. You refuse... Well, I'm going to have to search you for weapons. I don't want to have to do it. I'd be obliged if you'd leave us alone for a few minutes. You can either finish your drinks or take them with you. He ought to be locked up or something. That man's a menace. -I want to hear. -The other side please, sir. -But the captain-- -Shh. My money belt. Mr. Tilley, what did you mean when you told your wife that the rest of them might try praying for their salvation? You do remember saying that, don't you, sir? He did say that, Mrs. Tilley? That's right. That people are corrupt, that the world's heartless, senseless. Just one hint of disaster and they'd all panic, he said. Is that what you're trying to do, Mr. Tilley? Prove the susceptibility of human nature to panic? Mrs. Tilley, you say your husband is a scientist. Is he a psychiatrist or a sociologist? No, he's a chemical engineer. Quite a famous research man. Oh, I see. What kind of research, Mrs. Tilley? It was... well... Unstable compounds. -You mean explosives? -Yes, that's right. Explosives. Did you pack his bags, Mrs. Tilley? No, I packed my own. But didn't you check them to see he had everything he needed? -Yes, I did, but-- -But what? MRS. TILLEY: Wait a minute. I saw him put a small metal box, well, a container, rounded, into his briefcase. I wondered what it was. He didn't tell me what it was. He said it was just samples; chemical samples. That couldn't be... But people don't do things like that. Ernest, you wouldn't. Is that box still in his briefcase? No, no, I put it on the luggage rack. I would have felt it if it was there. Now then, sir, where did you put it? Mr. Tilley, there are 32 human beings on board this plane, including a little boy of eight. Human beings? Who gave them that name, other so-called human beings? I hate them as much as I hate Brock. They prefer his money to justice; they let him get away with it. You think-- You think you have a plane full of people here, you-- You have a traveling zoo! And as soon as they hear what's going to happen to them, they'll savage each other like the wild animals that they are. Now look, Mr. Tilley, if you've got explosives on board this plane, you're going to kill everyone, including all these passengers, your wife, yourself and a little boy of eight. You'll be a senseless killer, worse than Brock. What man ever showed me pity? If I had a bomb, a big enough bomb, I'd destroy the whole world! I'd do it. Oh, I'd do it. I'd do it-- Look at me. Look at me! Now, Mr. Tilley, you're a decent man. You've got to fight off this madness with everything you've got! You've got to fight it! Where is that metal case? Where is it?! There's a bomb on the plane. It'll kill us all! Whitman, I want you to take charge of this search. The Tilleys are sitting left aisle, row one. I want everything of theirs checked, ransacked if necessary. If you can't find anything, I want the rest of the passenger deck taken apart, that goes for the fore and rear freight compartments. We've got to find that metal case. The steward and the purser will help you. Aye, sir. Miss Leyton, you'll be working on your own, I'm afraid. Try to keep the passengers from being alarmed. The search is going to terrify them. I'd rather have terrified live passengers than calm dead ones. Serve them lots of drinks, serve them champagne. All right, we've all got our jobs. Panna, panna, panna. London control, this is Macair Golf Alpha Juliet Oscar Romeo. There's a bomb on this plane! I tell you there's a bomb on the plane! -That's right. -Who told you? -I heard them. -It'll kill every one of us! [all talking over each other] MRS. SATTERLY: There he is, searching for the bomb. We've already looked in everything we have. Ernest, please help. GEORGE: Where's the captain? He should be made to tell. -Mr. Tilley-- -Sir. -Where is that bomb? -Please let us-- You want to kill yourself or Brock, that's your business, but there are innocent passengers aboard this plane. -Go away. -You gonna-- Keep your hands off me, you animal, or it'll be sooner than you think. Sir... Please go back to your seat. The passengers have the right to know what you're going to do about this-- this homicidal maniac. Yeah. Please sit down. Mr. Tilley, I'd like you to go down to the lounge deck until further notice. It's for your own good. Thank you, captain. If explosives are hidden aboard this plane, as rumor seems to have it, we'll find them, but it could turn out that this danger's imaginary. However, there is a very real and serious danger that threatens us all, and that is panic. I tell you, those who behave badly now will be ashamed of themselves for the rest of their lives. No one, absolutely no one, must take matters into their own hands. No one or no group. You leave things to me and I'll pledge myself and my crew to your well-being without stint. Now you're all invited to enjoy our fine vintage wines and champagnes, compliments of the Atlantic Queen. Sit back, relax, and we'll get you to New York safe... and dry. -To the captain. -Hear, hear. Hurrah for the captain. Hurrah for the captain is it? Sucker. Sit back and be brave he says, and be blown to pieces. Well, here's one that's not going to sit back. I think you're absolutely right. Why don't you two hold hands? You might give each other enough courage to stop whimpering. -Hey, wait a minute. -Listen to her talk. Then behave, both of you. Who do you think you're speaking to, you little slut. There's enough trouble on this plane, Mrs. Satterly, without my being forced to drag you by your peroxide hair and throw you in the trash can where you belong! You shut up! She was only speaking for the good of us all, she only means-- I know what she means. I know what you mean. You're just a pair of whiners. Go and sit with her, go on, I don't want to be near you. Oh, very well, have it your own way, Miss Como. You're being very naughty, you know. Excuse me, could you use some help? 'Cause if I don't do something soon, I'll explode. There are some types on this plane. I know what you mean. You've got the job. Champagne, compliments of the captain. Well, that's very kind of him, but tell him we're not really that worried. Colonel, I'm Allen Mulliner. -Yes, Mr. Mulliner. -Look, you're a-- This is Doctor Bergstein. Look, you're a military man, I'm in steel. I don't care if it's war or business. In a crisis if the leadership is weak, you change it. Right? You're talking about Captain Bardow. We've got a time bomb aboard and he's floundering. You want somebody else to fly the plane? I just want a man of action on board to do something about this maniac. Like what? Like make him tell us where it is. You mean, by physical persuasion? -If necessary. -Look, Mr. Mulliner, people like Mr. Tilley don't capitulate to torture. He is mentally sick. Any real leader like Captain Bardow would know that at once. Yeah, but look, doc-- We have complete faith in Captain Bardow. Then you're both a pair of idiots just waiting to be bombed to hell. [scoffs] I thought the US Army produced something better these days than blind obedience. You're out. Grand piano is mine, darling. That's OK. It wouldn't fit in a bachelor apartment anyway. You may find your next true love sooner than you think. That's the best thing about a divorce case, it's the only kind of trial where if they find you guilty, they set you free, and I intend to stay that way a long, long time. To recover from me? Yes. But not the way you mean it. From the captain. Sweet or dry? -Oh, a little of both. -I think we prefer dry. What's going on up there? I mean, not just a rumor is it? Everything's under control, Mr. Forrester. Look, I want to know. Would you mind giving me back my wrist? -Let her go, Billy. -Thank you. -Sweet or dry? -Nothing, thanks. It's very good. I don't go for that phony stuff, you can keep it. -Sweet for him. -[chuckles] It's still the only way, make him talk. What if he won't? He will. You can make anybody talk if you've got the guts to go all the way. That's not necessarily true, young man. In my time, I've known a few noticeable exceptions. -That was in your time. -Billy! And they were better times, too. You know, if this thing blows up, I'll never travel by plane again. I can't quite decide whether you're afraid or not. Oh, I am. I'm scared to death. Same thing going on stage. I don't make jokes for the audience. -I do it to keep myself happy. -That's your secret. Well, that and these in an emergency. Faith, hope, and tranquility. Would you care to indulge? Some other time. Well, just add a few germs to give it taste. [chuckles] -Cheers! -Cheers! -Compliments of the captain. -Thank you. We don't want his bribes! We want action! Madam, may I tell you something? Tell me what? Tell you that you ought to watch your manners, Mrs. Satterly, even if she's too polite to say it, I'm not. You're not dead yet, you know. If we all leave it up to people like you, we'd all be dead as dodos. Pull yourself together, Mrs. Satterly. It doesn't look good, a woman of your age falling apart. I'll scratch your eyes out! Hey! Take it easy. What a disgusting spectacle you are. Look, ladies, is this absolutely necessary? Why don't you stop worrying the passengers and just get that maniac to tell us where he's hidden the bomb? We're doing everything that has to be done. -Now, please sit down, madam. -Don't you dare touch me. You could go to jail for that. You'll never work again, I'll see to that. Mr. Mulliner, I don't want to have to warn you again. Then don't warn me. What are you doing about our safety? I just said: everything that has to be done, including keeping you from making it worse. Wow, he's really catching it. I wouldn't like to be in his seat. When I tell Captain Bardow how you've been helping me, he'll be very nice to you. Don't you dare tell him anything about it. As leader of the opposition, you're not doing very well. You don't fool me, Miss Barrington. Why should I want to try and fool someone like you? You're just trying to show how superior you are. I've had you figured from the start. Lady-sure-of-herself, the ex-deb, high society. That's right. I belong to a society that tries to preserve the best of our culture, such as being calm in a crisis. I'm perfectly calm. Look, maybe I don't come from your class but-- Oh, I know, don't tell me. You're a man who came up from the ranks. Miner's son to chairman of the board, ambitious, energetic, efficient, self-reliant, resourceful. Everything but class and you can't forget it. There are thousands of accidents every day. I only had three drinks. I wasn't drunk. It could have happened to anyone. Was the blonde woman Sandra Williams? She was the one at the time wasn't she? She was a devil. She was an evil influence on you. Every man she ever fastened onto came to a bad end. Drinking, crazy driving, no wonder. She's the one that should be punished, not you. It was her, Rose, I didn't do things like that before her, you know that. We'll come out of this all right, dear. I know we will. I hope so, but a crazy fool like that can do anything. Look, do you think it was just a threat? I'm sure of it. Just to scare us. It isn't that easy to hide a bomb where it can't be found. Yes, I-- I suppose you're right. You couldn't have looked everywhere. Well, how about the unusual places. The first aid compartment, the fire extinguisher box. That's a good idea. All right, Bentley, you do that. Bentley's going to leave the bar phone off its cradle. If we're lucky, we might be able to hear what they're saying. -Listen, Skip-- -Shut up. Those are her footsteps going into the bar now. -Is she sure he-- -Quiet. MRS. TILLEY: Don't shut your mind, please. I'm listening, Carol. How can you do anything so monstrous, so hideous, how can you, Ernest? You hate me too? If you do this I will, and if there's another world I'll hate you in that one. You don't understand, Carol. Why did you marry me if you never understand me? How could I ever imagine that you'd ever want to do anything like this? You'll see, it'll be better this way. There's a terrible evil in this world, Carol. It sits inside us and sucks our blood. Oh, God, I've spent a wicked life, too. Making explosives to destroy. I hate myself. But I hate this world, too, and if I had a-- If I had a bomb, a huge bomb, I'd finish it. Oh, I'd do it. I'd do it, I'd do it, I'd do it. Stop it! Ernest, I beg you, on my knees I beg you, don't do this horrible thing. Don't be afraid Carol, it'll be over soon. Soon? How soon? The curse of the world will be on you if you do this. Even God will hate you. Do you hear that? Even God will hate you! I don't care. She shouldn't have lost her head. He said it would be soon, just in case you're still feeling relaxed. -Yes? -Nothing much, sir. The steward found this in the waste basket in the men's room. Tilley was in there just after take-off. Well, the thing might not go off. It might fizz. He's an expert on high explosives, remember. You know, I've got a feeling he might have timed it for the coast... so it can be seen. Whitman, if we use maximum speed all the way we can save 20 minutes. We might touch down before anything happens. How about our fuel consumption if we do that? Could be dicey, sir, but I'll have a figure in a minute. All right, check it. Michaels, you get in touch with London. Describe this in detail. Tell them to get the chairman of the board, if necessary, but find out exactly what they sell in those kinds of packets. All right, sir. Have you got that figure yet? Just coming. Just about make it with no edge at all, sir. Well, that's the way we're going to play it. I want full rated power as fast as she'll go. [engine revs] [gasps] Mr. Gilbert! I just wanted you to know I'm still alive. At least I'm not an angel yet. There could be no doubt about that. Do you play cards, Mr. Meadows? With you, five-aces Emma from Loadville? There are only four aces in my card pack. Come on, son, you only live once. Do you think we should be gambling before we go to meet our maker? I'll make a side bet you won't get even a scratch on this trip. Yeah, but supposing I win, how are you going to pay me out if I'm up there and you're down in the other place? Well, since you're being such a pip, I'll read your palm instead. I'm rather good at it. Come on, let me see. Don't bother with my love line today, just the life line. Is it going to end in, um... water? No water at all, no. But I see a great deal of money and huge audiences and lots of people, oh, many people, laughing, laughing. A long life and a merry one. You're going to be all right, Binky. Really. That's just my right hand. Do you think my left hand's going to be saved as well? [both laughing] Thank you, London. We'll keep in touch. Six volt battery wrapper. That means that something rigged with a battery may be on board this plane. I'll be he can set it off at will. That's a happy thought. Did you want to see me, captain? Yes, please. Saunders. -Sit down. -Yeah. Miss Como, uh-- It is Miss, isn't it? Yes, it's still Miss, thank you very much. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry. Don't be sorry. I'm very happy about it. Oh, well, look first I'd like to thank you for helping the stewardess. Oh, I was just helping myself really. I get very nervous sitting doing nothing. But you haven't had any more news about poor old Tilley? No news, neither good nor bad, but the bomb hasn't gone off yet. Well, I think that's splendid news. Yes, it is. Look, I wonder if you could help us a little bit more. We'd like you to be our eyes and ears among the passengers. Some of them might want to take matters into their own hands and others might panic; we'd like to know about the first and try to prevent the second. Maybe I could spike their drinks. I've got enough pills and tranquillizers to put this whole plane into a coma for weeks. Well, I can't give official sanction to that, but if you'd like to help some of your friends through an ordeal... Right, I'll tell Pam about anything I see or hear. All right. Thank you. -Oh, Dr. Bergstein. -Oh, forgive me. -Thank you. -The stewardess told me-- Yes, I know, doctor. Uh-- I'd like you to have a word with Mr. Tilley, if you would. My work is with tropical medicines, uh... I'm not a psychiatrist. Yes, I understand, but you are a doctor, you must know something about a sick mind. At least more than anybody else on board this plane. We've got to take every chance we can. Well, I'll try my best. That'd be good enough for me. The steward'll pass you down to the lounge deck. Thank you. EDWINA: I'm out by three points. Five-hundred and three, to be exact. -The car is yours, Edwina. -Correct. Astounding luck. You know, if I don't win something I may decide not to give you this divorce. Next. Oh, one Swedish cut glass set. Consider it my farewell gift to you. Think of me when you get around to drinking a glass of water. Don't try to be generous, Otis, it's out of character. Would you mind if I talked with you, Mr. Tilley? It's no use. What was your daughter's name? It's no use. That is my younger one, Lucy; a little devil, always in some mischief. Well, you can see by her eyes, can't you? This is Margot. Just two years old and... very different. Quiet. Studious. What was your daughter like? Mr. Tilley, I am a doctor. And I know how inhuman man can be. You see, I am a Jew. And I lived in Vienna during the war. I, too, have hate at mankind. Once I thought if this world would blow itself to pieces the rest of the universe would heave a sigh of relief. I know how you feel. I can understand. Good. I'm glad you agree with me. I did agree. But I have changed my mind. And I want to tell you why. Mr. Tilley, you have not yet looked at my daughters. That was very unkind of you, Mr. Tilley. They are the only pictures I have of them. Or ever will have. They died in concentration camp! You're trying to trick me. If your daughter was alive, do you think that she would approve, or even understand what you're trying to do? This is the question I have to ask myself time after time! Leave me alone. Answer the question and I will leave you alone. There are a thousand places he could have hidden it on a plane this size. It could take ten, 15 hours before it's ever found. What do you suggest, Mr. Mulliner? Every human being has his breaking point. Even a lunatic. It can happen any moment, there's no time to lose. What do you mean, breaking point? You mean torture him? We're just going to urge him to talk, so if you're squeamish about that-- I'm am. Excuse me, gentlemen, while I have another brandy... for nausea. Mr. Forrester, are you with us? Yeah, sure. Well, come on, let's get going. Let's get organized, Mrs. Satterly. You distract the steward who's guarding the stairway, then, uh... Mr. Gelderen, Mr. Forrester, you stand guard over the stairs while... we talk things over with Tilley. -Is all that clear? -All right. All right, then let's go. Oh, steward, I want a word with the captain at once. Well, I'm afraid that's not possible-- [overlapping dialogue] STEWARD : What do you think you're trying to do? GELDEREN: You stay out of this. -Has he told you anything yet? -No. All right, you get upstairs. Now, Mr. Mulliner, it's no good what you intend-- -Get out! -[yells] You stay out of this. I give you three seconds to start talking. Or I'll tear you apart, limb from limb. No, no, the man is ill. You must stop it. Run! If you lay a hand on me, it'll be over at once. MAN: Get out of my way, I'm going down there! What are you idiots doing? -I'm warning you! -Cut it out, cut it out! Stop it. If and when we get down, you two have a lot to answer for. Now, get up there. Ah, you chicken-hearted idiots. I might have saved your lives. -You all right, Mr. Tilley. -Leave me alone. How about you, doctor? Oh, thank you. The spectacles only. You know, I think we're the insane ones, trying to save your skin so you can blow us up. You've just saved yourself a few more precious minutes, that's all. Don't waste your time looking for the explosive. Because even if you find it, there's nothing you can do to stop it. MRS. SATTERLY: Sheep! Sheep, you're all sheep going to the slaughter. What are you sitting there for? Don't you know there's a bomb on the plane? Mrs. Satterly, you're going to have to calm down. All she's interested in is my being calm. She's doesn't give a damn about the bomb or about the lunatic down there. Just keep calm! Well, I'm not calm, I've suffered too much. Twenty-five years I took abuse, did everything a good wife should, gave him my youth, everything he wanted, and I loathed him. Now I'm going to die before I can use my freedom and all because of that lunatic down there and a weak captain who's afraid to do what he's got to do. Mrs. Satterly, you must come back to your seat. I'm warning you, keep away from me, keep away from me. Keep away from me! -Madam, please. -Don't you touch me! Keep your paws off me. Don't-- Don't you touch me! I'll scratch the skin off your face. Get away, get away! Don't you touch me! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Oh, God in Heaven, how can you do this to me? He was an evil old man and I was true to him, and I never did anything wrong, not once. Give me one year, just one year. Please, God, give me one year. Maybe this is God's justice catching up with me. Maybe I'm being punished for my sins, and you and Jeremy are being sacrificed for me... ...for what I've done. I've not been a good husband to you, Jane. What are you trying to tell me, Victor? You've every right to despise me, hate me. I never deserved you. I never considered you whenever I... ...wanted something myself. That's not true. You were always so sweet about it. Always brought me flowers or a gift, so you see you did care for me, worried about me, felt something. You mean you've known? What could I do? I always need you, like you need me now. You know what I'd like right now? A nice cup of tea. Best service you ever had, Mr. Gilbert. -That is you, not us? -Yes. -Are you frightened? -No. You are. You're frightened. Yes, I am frightened. The worst thing is not being able to show it, and telling people like that vile woman that everything is going to be all right, when inside, I-- I feel-- I feel like jelly. I don't know what made me think I was good enough for this job because I'm not. Come here. [exhales] Does that help... a little? Mm. A lot. Come back for more then, whenever you want. Gil, I want to tell you something. Well, ordinarily I'd do what most girls do. That is, I-- I'd make you run after me. I'd be whimsical, unreasonable, but in the end I'd give in. I just wanted you to know, in case-- Wait a minute. You don't have to tell me this. If the best thing that's ever going to happen to us in this world is happening right now, it doesn't matter, does it? No. -Ace of diamonds. -Oh, however did you do that? [chuckles] I've got friends. Oh, stewardess, is room service still on? Yes, would you like some hot coffee? Well, how about two more of those lovely martinis for my chum and I? Certainly, Mr. Meadows. Any more news about the terrible Mr. Tilley? -No, nothing new yet. -Well, as long as we don't all get the news at the same sudden moment. So you say you play poker, eh? -Played for 60 years. -Well, we'll soon see. How do you like it, open or closed? Closed. Closed it is. Got your cards? Make your bid. [chuckles] Whatever you do, I raise. -Oh, you're one, you... -[chuckling] Billy, I thought you said you were throwing that thing away. -Did I? -Yes, you did. Gee, I didn't know you needed the stuff that much. You didn't like me joining the action party, did you? -Well, did you? -No. No, Billy. It's still the only way. Make him talk. A man just can't sit by and let himself be destroyed, can he? That's not a man. Ah, you don't understand. Maybe I understand a lot more than you think I do. I could tell you-- Look, will you leave me alone? Will you just leave me alone? Will you leave me alone?! Sad, people going to pieces like hysterical hens. We may not go to pieces but we might be blown to pieces. It wouldn't be the end of the world, just of us. -Gin and game, my dear. -Oh, no, not already. Yes. And that gives me the complete sitting room, including your golf clubs. My golf clubs? Now just how do you figure that? We said everything in the sitting room? Yeah. You've insisted on leaving your golf clubs there no matter how many times I've tried to stop you. [scoffs] You're absolutely right. Your golf clubs. -Amazing how you keep winning. -Amazing? Just a better player, darling. Ten. Better? It is luck, Edwina, but I'm glad you have it. You never could face an unpleasant fact, Otis. Why would I find it unpleasant if a wife of mine happens to have some little skill? You just do. Jealousy, I suppose, or-- Jealousy? I was stupid enough to be in love with you, to admire you. If ever I made a witty remark at a party, you always tried to say something funnier. Witty remark? You? When did that happen? At the Whitfields'. They laughed like drains last time time I was there. [chuckles] You're simply trying to goad me into breaking at down so that you can take me into your arms and comfort me. You haven't the courage to say you'd like me to take you back. If you're making a peace overture, I wish you'd do it a little more subtly, dear. How you flatter yourself, Otis. It's not bad. Having an enjoyable trip, Miss Barrington? There's nothing one can do, so why get hysterical? You think I'm hysterical? I've seem calmer men. I maybe a willing lamb, Miss Barrington, but I'm not ox waiting to go to slaughter. I think you're afraid to die, Mr. Mulliner. And you're not? Of course I am, but I wouldn't dream of letting it show. If they'd let you do what you wanted to do, we'd all be safe. Mr. Brock, your safety is of no interest to me at all. Well... -Rose. -What is it, James? There's one way they can stop this lunatic blowing us all up. -How? -By killing me. Nobody's going to kill you. No, don't you see, if they get rid of me, he'll be satisfied. That fellow in front, he'd do it. He'd stop at nothing. When Tilley sees that Brock is dead, I guarantee you that that bomb will not go off. The whole world will applaud us, Mr. Forrester. We'll have saved a plane full of people, and destroyed one rat that doesn't deserve to live. The way we do it, no one will ever know who to blame. -We all agreed? -Mm. Oh, if any do-gooders come along, don't let up. Now, as soon as the stewardess leaves, we'll start. Go back to your seats. When I get up, start sauntering up to him. We'll all converge on him at the same time. A tangle, a tumble of bodies, and when we separate, one dead man. Who can blame any one person? All right. I think I will change my seat, Mr. Mulliner. Why now? Because I'd rather be a spectator to a murder than participate in one. Who said anything about murder? It's the only other possible answer; to do in the wicked Mr. Brock. So you're above it all, eh? Not in the least. I've never see a murder. I'm just dying to see one. Do join me if all goes well. Keep away or I'll pull this! I'm warning you! What shall we do? That door won't open in flight. It will! Up here, no-- no oxygen. -No, he'll kill us all! -He says the door won't open. They're going to murder me! Won't somebody help me! [all yelling] -You can't do this. -Stay out of this! -Stay out! -You can't do this! [grunting] Don't let him get away! Get him! Stay away from me. Don't let him break that window! -[glass shatters] -[air hissing] [yelling] I'm all right. What's our rate of descent? SAUNDERS: There's a gale below 15,000. Make it seven, air brakes out! OK, pull her out! [thunder rumbles] It's very close here. Nonsense. You'll just have to go easy on the hard stuff, that's all. -Green. -Sir. Here's the rope, sir. -Can you handle this, please? -Yes. There's something I've got to do. -How is he? -Conscious. He's got a cut above his eye; still very unfriendly. You didn't tell him about Brock? That was a trump card I didn't want to waste. I thought you ought to do it. -The sooner the better. -Good luck. [thunder rumbles] He's going down to tell him. Do you think it will do any good? I don't know. Do you think...? I feel funny. I can't stop shivering. -I feel so cold. -Do you want another drink? No. I mean, don't worry about what I said. No, not a drink. Clara, what's got into me? I feel as though I'm frozen. Billy, you're white. It must be a reaction. Oh, Clara, make me warm. So, he's dead. Do you want to come up and see for yourself. No. I believe you. Well, he's paid for his crime. -But have you? -Me? Yes, you. And the rest of the world. And all of them who let him get away with it because of his money and power. The man who looks the other way is one with the sinner. Well, I'll make them all turn their heads and see that no man is free from guilt. None! He's been with that madman long enough to find out something! That captain of ours hasn't got a clue. Mr. Mulliner. Look, you've made an ugly mess here. I want to tell you that if you budge from this seat once again-- Don't you threaten me, you obedient little soldier boy. Now you sit there until this is all over, understand? Or I'll give you the most humiliating licking of your life. [thunder rumbles] Thanks. You're going to destroy that soldier if you ever get out of this alive, aren't you? I'm not going to forget him, and he's not going to forget me. But what if Mr. Tilley still doesn't change his mind? [chuckles] Mr. Tilley, your bomb isn't going to change anything. The world will still go on wherever it's going. There'll always be people like Brock and the weak people who give in to him, but there are others who face up to catastrophe and tragedy without bitterness, -without hate. -You're wasting your time. The sin must be wiped out. I've sworn to purge the sin! You can't judge in God's place. You can't say what is sin and what isn't, who's to live and whose to die. It will be done before the hour is out, and nothing, nothing will stop it! This is a nightmare, Jane. We should have gone by boat, the way you wanted to. [sobbing] Gorblimey, look at that lightening! Mustn't say gorblimey, son. It's not a real word at all. -Captain, Miss Como to see you. -Right. Show her in. Miss Leyton says you have some kind of suggestion. Well, I have one or two ideas; I hope I'm not completely out of line. No, I'm desperate enough to listen to anything. The executioner's kindly given us the precise moment. It's in exactly-- No. Don't tell me. I don't want to hear. OK, silly suggestion number one: couldn't we signal a ship, make a landing in the sea so that they can pick us up right away? No. We've thought of that. As you can see, we're in a bad storm, our survival time down there would be nil. No, I've made up my mind. I think now that force is the answer, that Mulliner was right this whole time. -Mulliner? No! -I know It's a bad turn in the road, but I've got no time for anything else. Listen, you wanted my opinion, I say wait. But we can't wait. According to my calculations he's got it timed for just before the coast, to drag out the agony, or prove a point, or whatever his lunatic brand of showmanship is, but it gives us a few more minutes at the best. Look, force won't work, not with him. Surely that's just last chance thinking. But it is the last chance. It's better than no chance at all! Look, I have another suggestion to make. There's a boy on board. He's only eight years old. Let him talk to him. He's a child. He can't hate a child. Let me get him for you. You can talk to him, tell him what to say. [thunder rumbles] JEREMY: But I want you to come with me. No, Jeremy, you must go alone. I don't want to go alone. Jeremy you must. We're all depending on you. You want that flying medal from Captain Bardow, don't you? Go on then. My name is Master Jeremy Tracer, sir. What's that? My name is Master Jeremy Tracer, sir. Who sent you? Miss... I forget. What did she say? JEREMY: She told mother and father that you were very sad, and I must try to cheer you up. I know a funny story. A man came home once, when it was very cold outside and he saw his sister sitting by the fireplace. It made the man very angry. You know why? Because they didn't have a fireplace. You see, the house was burning down and his sister was sitting watching it. First I was going to be a motor mechanic when I grow up, fix cars, but then I heard Father tell Mommy what trouble there is in making rocket ships, so I think I'll make rockets to the moon and Mars, and even to the sun. I'll have to make that one like a fridge because the sun's very hot, you know. Isn't that a good idea? Are you crying? Go back, Jeremy. Go back to your mother. But you're not happy. Get out! Come on, Jeremy, I'll take you back to your mommy. -No, not yet. -I want to go to my mommy. Get down there, Jeremy. Get down. Now, Mr. Tilley. I want you to tell this boy just what you're going to do. Jeremy, Mr. Tilley is angry with the world because a bad man ran over his daughter and killed her. Now he's hidden a bomb on the plane that's going to kill us. Listen, boy, this bomb can explode and all of us, you, your mommy and daddy, will all be blown to bits and thrown into the ocean. Do you understand? It's a lie. You're just trying to frighten me. It's a lie. It's a lie, isn't it? Go, on, Mr. Tilley, answer him. You can't be that far gone, you can't answer a child. [thunder rumbles] Well, answer him, damn you! I want to be alone with the boy. I don't want to cheer him up any more. I want to come with you. Be brave, Jeremy, just for a little. Stay here. I don't want you two standing out there listening. -Are you afraid of me? -Yes. Jeremy, if someone killed your mother and father, you'd hate them, wouldn't you? Yes. Well, you see, the whole world killed my little girl. I didn't. I didn't kill anyone. No, not you. My father and mommy didn't. They never killed anyone. They don't even like to watch television with killings in them. They're the nicest people in the world. May I go now, sir? Yes. Glad to have met you, sir. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. ERNEST: Jeremy. Come back. Jeremy, I-- I have something for you. This is Billy. Are you going to make the bomb explode like she said? [thunder rumbles] There is... ...no more bomb, Jeremy. Give it to the captain, Jeremy, and tell him that the metal case never was in his plane. And that when he lands, he'll find it under the port wing, held on by suction fasteners. The bomb's quite harmless without its remote control, and the control's quite harmless without that battery. Tell him... he almost found it, but that if he had, the end would have been then. Off you go. He gave me this bird. It's a smasher. Oh, and this battery to make the bomb go off. [toy rattles] Come along, darling, we're almost there. [scoffs] You know, he could have made it go off any time he wanted to. Poor man. What an evening! I can't say I mind seeing the sunset this day. A lot of good things have happened, too. I told you everything would be all right. I'll always listen to you from now on. How old did you say you'd be when you go upstairs? Seventy-nine, and remember, you'll survive me by four years, but don't worry about it, I carry lots of life insurance. I'll miss you dreadfully, anyway. It's going to be very tedious telling our friends we're together again. It'll cast a pall of gloom for weeks. They'll call us phonies. Still, everybody can't be happy at once. Hey, would you like to play for fun? You mean for love? Uh-huh. You'll see, I'll win now, that's my luck. Don't resent it so much, darling. Money isn't everything. Deal. [giggling] You know, they're going to think it's very odd. Odd, what? Oh, with all your problems they're going to wonder how you found the time. Time? To get that red stuff all over your mouth. Michaels, call the tower. Long Final Zero Four. Full flaps. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain. We are preparing to land. I'd like to thank you all... ...very much. Oh, dear, this always confuses me. Allow me. Just an excuse to make a pass at you. Oh, I only wish it were! [tires screeching]
