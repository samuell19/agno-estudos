He says it's fuckin' wide-open down there. - Yeah. Where in Florida? - Florida. The beach. The whole economy's moving down there. They call it the Sun Belt. The economy's gotta be good for us to make any kind of real money. Whatsa matter? You don't think they got their own wise guys in Florida? Florida and Arizona .. because of the energy crisis .. I heard a whole conversation on the Long John Neville Show. Problem up here is you got 3,000 wise guys all chasing the same fuckin' nickel. You're from there, down there, Florida, huh Donnie? Lot of parking meters down in Florida. You guys think this is funny, huh? I'm the skipper now I gotta answer! Fifty grand a month .. I kick up to Rusty. Every month! And one day, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna be here in this same fuckin' room .. with all these same fuckin' guys... talking about the same fucking scams... that never amount to nothing! That's how I'll know I've been sent to fucking hell. Joe, give these humps another drink. It's all they're good for. I'll tell you right now, we better start earning or somebody's gonna get clipped. Why did you inject that Donnie, with Florida? - Whadda ya talkin' about? I didn't inject nuttin. - You injected that, Donnie. Don't tell me no. I know you. You don't say nothing unless there's a reason for it. - I .. uh .. I was making conversation with the guy. - Mr. Smart Conversation .. you tell me .. What happens .. if Sonny Black decides he wants to go to Florida? Oh my God! Who said he's gonna go to Florida? Donnie .. don't. Don't think you could pull the wool over my eyes. Donnie, I see you siding up to Sonny Black, with my eyes. I'm lookin' at you. You're doin' it. Come on. I ain't siding up to Sonny Black. He goes to Florida .. you're responsible... and I'm responsible, because I represent you. Left, come on. I was just bullshitting around. You think you can trust Sonny Black. You can't trust Sonny Black. Sonny Black is one big, fat, fucking snake in the .. - Grass. Snake in the grass. - You can't say that now. - Sonny Black is a skipper.You don't open your fuckin' mouth about him. - Lefty This fucking guy, Richie, calls me up, he says ?lookit ... I'm getting hassled by a couple of half-assed wise guys.? So he's looking for a partner, ya know, to give him a little peace of mind. He's got this nightclub to run down there. - He's got a nightclub there? - Yeah. Got a singles bar. It's near the beach. I got two grenades in my house.

King's Court, heh .. where every man is a king. Now wait until you get a load of the banquet room. You're gonna plotz. - Donnie - Huh? Ask him why this place is such a fuckin' dump. - Donnie - He wants to know .. uh .. why it's such a dump, Richie. I had to shut the doors. The way these bums had their hands in my pockets, ya know. 200 bucks for this, 300 bucks for that .. Hey! I got a wife does that, ya know what I mean? Ask him to leave, Donnie. - Richie. Step outside. Take a look at the car. - Sure. Great. What kind of a man has a malvole? He won't provide for his own wife. - I'm telling you this guy's all right. - You vouch for him? - I'm sayin' .. uh .. when I knew him before, he was all right. - You vouch for the guy? I'm just makin' an introduction, Left. You gotta make the decision about the joint. This would be somethin', you know? We had my own lounge down here .. me and you. Ya know? What about Sonny? Imagine Sonny Black operating down here .. The way he is? Come on. Sonny Black belongs in Brooklyn. Well I guess if .. uh everything worked out... we could send a few fazools up there no? Thirty years I'm busting my hump. What do I got? Even a dog gets a warm piece of the sidewalk. I ought to show something for what I did. - Ya know what I mean? - Definitely. This ain't New York down here. New York with the politics, all the old beefs and the grudges. Down here .. a guy like me .. could sit down with the boss. You know what I'm saying? Get out from under, be a free agent again. I'm telling you, Donnie. Nothing but nothing but right. Lefty .. uh .. wants to ask Santo Trafficante for permission to operate down here. - You gotta give me a boat. - We can't afford that kind of money. - What kind of a boat? - What kind of a boat. I don't know. Like a 70-footer. - I jus' want to take him out for the day. - You're talking $6,000 a day here, Joe. Santo Trafficante is the boss of Florida. - He sits on the fuckin' Commission. Did you know that? - Yeah, I knew that. - Good. Boat? - It's up to 80 actually We just picked up Lefty on a wiretap talking to one of Trafficante's guys. Just have a few things we'd like to go over here, ya know .. to make a loan-sharking indictment. This is important! 90, actually. All right. I did what you asked. I came here down here, I vouched for this fuckin' guy. So what .. I'm gonna take Santo Trafficante out in a rubber ducky now, or what? We're gonna have to wash your mouth out bud. - Does Sally Paint glass report to Nicky or Nicky Cigars? - Nicky Glasses. Nicky Glasses? Look, as I was saying here, we've got to try to fold Sonny into the RICO .. Hey, I need a boat for this fucking sit-down! I'm a Mormon, mister. Now clean it up! Joe, I think you got a malfunction on your tape recorder. I'm not getting anything here. I'm worried. He's getting strung out. We can get what we want. Fuck him. There it is. Just move 'em behind, nice and slow. Nice and slow. Why don't you count it, my friend. Go ahead. It's all there. No bullshit. We're bueno? Pleasure doing business with you, caballeros. Oh, Columbia, the gem of the ocean The home of the brave and the free - Fuck. - Fuck! - Mommy, I need some help. - Hello. - Hey. - Hey. - It's too tight. - Here, sweetie. - I'm in Florida. - What are you doin' in Florida?

Young lady, you are wearing this coat. - Bitch. - What did you call me? Hey, is everything all right? What if I said no, Joe? Would it make any difference? - I guess not. - I guess not, so don't ask me. Come on, stand up. ?John Wayne dead. Nation mourns.? How can John Wayne die? Fuckin' Indians got him. Old-fashioned family man. Ruled with an iron hand. Look at that. Maggie, let me talk to Kerry. I wanna talk to her about the Communion. Oh, my God, Joe. She doesn't want to do it. What do you mean, she doesn't want to do it? She ain't got no choice. - You are wearing this coat! - Put her on the phone, Maggie. I don't know when I'm gonna have another chance to call. - Does she know not to bite the wafer? - I don't know. She's actin' out or something. - All right. Look, I'll be back next week. - Thank you. Maggie, I promise I'll get back for her Communion. - Yours doesn't look any better. - Don't start in with your sister. - Joe, I gotta go. - Huh? I love you. Oh shit. Who was that on the phone, Richie? Nah. Uh .. What did .. uh .. what did Sonny say? - You told Sonny about the club? - Nah, I thought you did. - Just shut up about it. Call Richie. - All right.

Donnie. Don, don't tell me no. You gotta get that boat. I reached out already. His man says to me, ?Lefty, he loves boats.? I told him a hundred-foot boat I'm on the fuckin' clothesline now. All right. I told ya. I'm working on it. - Don't disappoint me again, Donnie. Please. - Disappoint you again? Since when did I disappoint you? Forget about it. What's this? Look at that. That what we call each other. Wait, wait, wait. Friend of mine, friend of ours. Yeah. Good. Good. But there's the double meaning .. You get it? - Ya know what I mean? - Yeah - A boss appreciates a thing like that. - Uh huh. - Yeah. The .. uh .. the irony of it. - Yeah, irony. All right. Forget about it. You put a beaner inside here... then he knows these are men of men.

Fuck. - Hey, can I ask you something? - What? What's ?Forget about it?? What is that? ?Forget about it? it's like uh .. if you agree with someone. Ya know, like, ?Raquel Welch is one great piece of ass.? ?Forget about it.? But then, if you disagree, like, ?A Lincoln is better than a Cadillac?? ?Forget about it.? .. ya know? But then it's also like .. if something is the greatest thing in the world, like... ?Minga, those peppers! Forget about it!? You know? It's also like saying, ?Go to hell.? Like, ya know .. like .. uh .. ?Hey Paulie, you got a one-inch pecker.? And Paulie says, ?Forget about it.? ?Forget about it.? Poof! ?Forget about it.? Sometimes it just means .. uh .. forget about it. All right. Thank you very much. I got it. - Let me tell you something.

Go to the bow. I'm gonna stay in the stern. Go to the bow. Stay there. I'm so disgusted with you, you know that? - Yeah, you just said it. - Yeah. Just so you know. - Hey! - Hey. - How ya doin'? - Oh that Trafficante is something else boy, I'll tell ya'. Is that right? He's a good old guy? Ahh forget about it. That motherfucker had this all to himself for .. 50 fuckin' years, and it's still a cow town. This could be like .. Vegas down here. Forget about Sonny Red .. and his trucks in Jersey. This is all I want .. Florida. Tell you something. Sonny Red .. is freezing his nuts off right now. That's for sure. All I need is the start-up money from Rusty... and then we all get rich. Whadda ya think? We gonna head back to New York pretty soon or what? Not you. I want you to represent me down here, Donnie. I want you to be my man in Florida. Get that club goin'. Ya know, Kings Court. You didn't think I knew about that, did ya? I think I'm gonna send the lion down here with you .. And keep that big pussy in the parking lot. Yeah. You know, Sonny, I really appreciate .. uh ..the offer and everything... but I gotta lot of things going on in New York. - and .. uh ..I'd like to keep them going. - You know, Lefty's a dynamite guy, there's no doubt about it. Ya know, he looked after me when I was in the can .. And that's something that I don't forget .. something that I will never, ever forget. Yeah, I mean he's a stand-up guy. I mean he .. he really cares about you, too. Yeah. Yeah, I know he does, but .. uh .. The problem is is that, ya know, you think that he's helpin' you... but he's hurtin' you. He gets those two or three wines in him .. - You know, Donnie, you know what I'm sayin'? - Yeah. Sonny .. I don't wanna be steppin' on nobody's toes. - I mean, if it wasn't for Left, I .. - That's it. That's it. Look .. You belong to me now. That's it. Mr. Trafficante's leavin'. - You believe that? - Christ, they're killing me. - Come here. - Santo, this is .. uh .. Donnie. - He's a friend of ours. - Hi, Donnie. Nice to meet you. - This is Johnny. - Hi. How ya doin'? - Hey listen. Give my best to Joe, will ya? - Yeah, I will. Snowed in. Snowed in. Can you believe that? Yeah, right.

Oh, sweetheart. Honey. Your father .. is so proud of you. I'm going upstairs. Goddamn it, Joe. The number you have dialed has been changed. The new number is unpublished at the subscriber's request. Hey Left, get us checked in over there, will ya? - Hey Donnie. Stick around. I'm gonna get a paper. - All right. Jesus, Joe, That's Holtman, U.S. Attorney, comin' at us. The guy on the right. Christ Joe, whadda we gonna do? All right. Why don't you just shut the fuck up and I'll take care of it. Hey. Anything goes wrong down there... you have .. their people call .. your people in New York, you understand? - I don't want to come down here and iron anything out. - Hey Joe? - You really fuckin' aggravate me. - You got your plane tickets .. uh .. Sonny? - Pistone? Remember me? Southern District .. - What kind of fucking shit .. - Hey, whadda ya .. whadda ya doin'? - He grabbed my cock. What the fuck! Shut up. He's working. Keep your mouth shut. Fucking degenerate bastard. What a sick fuck. Grabbed my cock. - Listen, I want that club up and running. I don't care how long it takes. You understand me? - Got it. Here comes a fuckin' cop. Get the hell outta here. You have a safe trip. You have the tickets and everything? Now listen to me. Get on the phone. Get me on the next flight back. Understand? Don't call me Joe again. I'll cut your fucking throat. Understand? You piece of shit. - Daddy? - Hi, baby. - Who made you? - God made me. - Why did God make you? - God made me to show His goodness .. to make me happy with Him in heaven. - Where is God? - God is everywhere. Sweet dreams, angel. I want a divorce. Yeah, he comes home at all hours of the night without announcing when or why or where he's been... for the last .. three months. And you know what he does? He rearranges the cabinets. He remakes the bed. He vacuums the entire house. Do you know another man that vacuums the house? It's abnormal behavior. Oh well, you know, changing the phone number and not telling your husband is pretty normal. - All right. I don't exist, you don't exist. - OK. So now I know how it feels. No no. I know how you feel. I'll tell you something, Joe. It felt good. Now I do know .. how it feels to be so in control. Now I know how it feels to be strong. - You love control, don't you? - My God. Please, Joe. Just listen. Otherwise you just play out the old pathology. Maggie, you were saying Joe leaves. Yes, he leaves. He leaves me .. with the house and the kids... and the bills.. but not a husband. I want my husband. Joe .. What do you think you're running from? I ain't running from nothin'. You hear yourself? The man I married was a college man. Being the distancer forces Maggie into the role of the pursuer. This gives you a feeling of power. Simultaneously, you resent Maggie for .. for fulfilling her intimacy needs which .. I'm an undercover agent for the FBI .. uh .. Doctor. You and your Mafia faggots can go screw each other. I'm not gonna do it anymore. Oh boy! I really hope that you can help her out. Because obviously, she's very sick, and you can see that. Oh obviously. Obviously I'm the sick one. - You. - Now... Monday, Wednesday and Friday are Joe's .. intimacy days. Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday are Maggie's. Now, on your day, you make an intimacy request. ?Rub my back? or... ?I have a problem with the kids. Could you help me out?? Oh, you know what? You sit around in your safe, little, fuckin' house... with your .. your safe, little, fuckin' station wagon... and your safe, little friends. You dream up the next hundred-dollar head fuck. - >Will you rub my back?> Fungool. - You're an animal, do you know that? - Just get in the fucking car. - Do you know that, huh? You know what my intimacy request is for that guy? It's very intimate. He can take the bill he's gonna send me and shove it up his ass. You know why we went to him? I was hoping he could come up with one good reason for me not to leave you .. because I don't have one anymore. What? .. You gonna leave me? You gonna leave me, Maggie? You don't leave me. - Hello - Hey Mag. Oh my God! He's .. - What's the matter? - Donnie, where are you? Uhh ,, I'm in New York. I had to come back. Why? - It's Tommy. - What? What's goin' on?

You gotta go back. Come on. What happened to him? He gonna be all right? Do I know? They got 12 fuckin' diplomas on the wall, and they can't tell you a fuckin' thing. Forget about it. Tommy gets out of this fucking Bellevue... he's going right back to fucking up. What'd he do? He overdose? That ain't the question. A plastic pipe .. in his mouth. About five million .. tubes. They got a machine breathin' for him. Where's the fuckin' doctor? You want me to go talk to this guy for you? We gotta talk to the doctor. Whadda ya gonna do, break his legs? I'm sayin', do you want me to do somethin'? I'm here, ya know? Yeah. I want you to go back .. down to Florida. You belong to Sonny now, Donnie. Believe me. Look! I came here to be with you.

I ain't goin'. - Forget about it, I ain't .. - Come on! Hey look. I'm gonna stay here with you. You wanna kick the shit outta me? I'm gonna be right here. All right? Twenty-eight years. You can read it on his .. birth certificate. Bellevue Hospital. Now he's back, in there. And I'm out here, worried to my fuckin' death. And he's asleep in there .. same as 28 years ago. With the same expression. He's made no progress. He ain't got no fuckin' respect. He's my son. His heart stopped. Like a watch. That's what the doctor said. Just like a watch. They had to wind it back up. Who knows? Maybe next time... they can't. Hey! He's gonna be all right. He'll be all right, pal. He'll be all right. I love you, Donnie. Burn, baby burn Hey, all right!

If everything's okay, what are you doing here, huh? Mind if we come inside, Mrs. Pistone? I'm not sure. That depends. Standard .. procedure is that he is to check in with us every day. Now maybe he might miss a day or two here or there, but .. - It was three weeks ago. - I want you to tell me .. where my husband is. - I demand right that you tell me where my husband is! - We can't tell you because we don't know. Now if he gets in touch with you, you have got to try to talk some sense into him. Mrs. Pistone .. - Please .. help us here. - You want me to help you out? - Yes. You want me to help .. out the FBI that used my husband and sucked him dry? You don't care whether he's dead or alive, do you? You want him to follow procedure. Follow procedure so you can cover your asses. Mrs. Pistone, there is a war going on in the Mafia family where Joe is undercover. Now, three leaders of a rival faction have been murdered. He's right in the line of fire, not because he's one of us, because he's one of them. Who he's with and and .. who he's close to .. they're all the top dogs now. - It's just not a problem we anticipated. - We have got to pull him out! And you .. have got to talk to him. He'll listen to you. You think so? He was here a week ago. He snuck into the house after I was asleep. And he didn't even wake me up .. didn't even say hello to me. He came to get his sport coat. Forgive me And please say you are mine Solo tu - Hey Donnie! - Yeah. - Let's take a walk. Come on. Cara mia ti amo Hey Left, whadda we doin'? We're gonna walk and talk.

Hey, you know that boat you used to have? That Bertram? - The boat? What about it? - Yeah, the boat. How much is it .. a boat like that? How much uh .. whadda you think? You could get a .. sports fisherman for maybe .. 300 used. Why are you asking me about boats, Donnie? - I was just wonderin'. I was curious, ya know. - You're curious about boats? - Yeah. It's .. ten .. degrees out here! I'm freezing. You're asking me about boats? After what we just said? - Hey! You losin' your marbles on me, or what? - Nah. I'm all right. I'm all right. = You don't ask questions like that. That's .. crazy. OK? - Yeah. You hit this cocksucker and leave him in the street. Come on. - You wanna tell me what's going on? - Nuttin'. Go back to bed. I'm looking for somethin', all right? I'll be right in. It's not gonna work anymore. - Where is it? - There's $300,000 in that bag. - How do you know what's in that bag? - I uh .. I counted it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You counted it? - Yeah. Anyway, you counted it! It's none of your business. It's none of my business? It's in my house. Who would ever believe it wasn't my business Joe? I want that fuckin' bag Maggie. FBI men .. do not walk around with $300,000 in a bag. - Joe. You could go to jail for this. - Shut the fuck up! Nobody's goin' to jail. Nobody's goin' to .. Did you think about your children for a second? - Joe, did you stop and think about your children? - You have no idea what you're talkin' about first of all. - I don't? - Because the bag belongs to somebody else. - I don't have any idea? It does? Who? - What am I gonna explain to you? Just some fucked-up guy. - A fucked-up guy? A fucked-up guy needs $300,000? Yeah that's right. Now where's the goddamn bag? Shit! You're becoming like them, you know that? Did you ever once ask yourself how I make it through my days, huh? I pretend I'm a widow .. with medals and scrapbooks... and memories. I pretend you're dead. That's how my life makes sense to me. Just go away. Stay away. Why do you hate me when I love you so much? You think I hate you? I don't hate you. This job is eatin' me alive. I can't breathe anymore. And if I come out, this guy Lefty dies. They're gonna kill him .. because he vouched for me .. because he stood up for me. I live with that every day. That's the same thing as if I put the bullet in his head myself, you understand? I spent all these years .. trying to be the good guy you know what I mean, in the white fuckin' hat. For what? For nothin'. I'm not becoming like them, Maggie. I am them. - Left. - Donnie. - Donnie. Where you been, Donnie? Yeah. Look uh .. I gotta see ya. You're right you gotta see me. - We found Sonny Red's kid. - Bruno? - Yeah. He's on a boat .. on Staten Island. - I'll pick you up. - No, no. We .. we don't have time, Donnie. You .. you meet me there. - OK Bruno's here .. He's down the end of the pier. We'll wait here a minute while he has his drink. Let him get a little sleepy. - I'm getting a little sleepy myself. - How's his boat? - The boat? - Yeah. Nice. Forget about it. One thing I know is boats. I'd like to pop him, throw him in the water, take the fuckin' boat. Remember when you said a couple a times how .. uh .. if you had that Bertram again... you'd drive down to the pier with Annette .. and just go. Remember you said that? North, South, East, West, nobody'd ever find you. That was before. Don't remind me about that now. - Yeah, but I'm just saying .. - I don't want to think about that. Did you mean it? Mean it? Who am I Rockefeller? I'm gonna go buy a boat? - I'm saying, what if, Left? - What if. - What if .. i mean .. I got a couple things going on the side there, couple a jewel things. Maybe I could get that kinda money for ya. - You gonna find money for me to get a boat? - Maybe. Now that would be real generous of you, Donnie. What if I could hand you .. a bagful of money right now? You know what I'm saying? You could leave this life. You said it yourself, Left. You don't move up Every day you're looking over your fuckin' shoulder, you don't know what's gonna happen .. - Donnie, listen to me, Donnie. - No more bullshit .. - Donnie - Get outta this life is what I'm sayin' Left. - I'm gonna show you somethin' Donnie. - What? - And I want you to look at it very carefully. And then I want you to think .. very carefully... about what you say to me. That's a federal boat, Donnie. - I really don't think that's the same boat, Left .. - That's the same boat. It's got some name on it .. The Left Hand. It's like my name. That's that Abscam boat. You think I knew that was a federal boat? You think I'm a fucking rat? How many times .. I have you .. into my own house? - Twice a week. Twice a week at least. - Ahh, there it is .. at least. - I cook for you. - Yeah. If ever I had any money, I'd give you .. I never had any money, but if ever I had... a hundred bucks in my pocket, I'd give you fifty, right? - Yeah, you did. - If you're a rat .. If you're a rat, then I'm the biggest fuckin' mutt in the history of the Mafia. Even if this thing is a federal boat, Left... they scam all these other people. They didn't scam us .. You know what I'm saying? We went. We had a great party. We walked away from it. How do you know .. that we walked away from it? Well, we're sitting here, right? So they tried to outsmart us, but we out smarted them. We beat the agents. You gotta believe me. OK. Let's go do this work. Get this over with. Two in back of the ear. Like pushin' a button. Bing-bing. That's it. - Yeah. - Don't freeze up. - Don't freeze up. - Nah. - Lotta guys freeze up. - Nah, I'll be all right. Did I say youse a rat? - I can't believe you brought that up. - C'mon.

It's over, Joe. 1290 01:56:16.354 --> 01:56:20.541 When the deep purple falls Over sleepy garden walls And the stars begin to twinkle in the sky You've known this guy as Donnie Brasco. That's not his real name. Truth is, he's been an FBI agent all along. You can contact me here, if .. you wanna talk. Could believe those fucking guys? There's no way Donnie's an agent.
