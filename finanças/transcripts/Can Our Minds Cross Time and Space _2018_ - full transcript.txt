Most humans believe that time only flows in one direction, and that mind-to-mind communication is impossible. But there are some who believe this is not the case, that they can see into the future and into the minds of others. Is this possible? It's something I need to investigate. My father was a scientist running a top secret government project. One night in his lab, an experiment went horribly wrong, rendering him invisible. Fearing he was disappearing forever, he rushed home to see my mother. And nine months later, I was born. My life's mission is to investigate concepts on the fringe of science, conducting experiments to test those claims regardless of taboo or seeming unprovability, searching for the clues that will make me visible. I walk on the edge of science. I am Mister Tachyon. Humans have long been fascinated with those who claim they can use their minds to gather information across time and space. Is the power to predict the future or read minds real? I'm going to begin my investigation by looking into the work of Dr. Rupert Sheldrake, who claims to have measured both precognition and telepathy. Sheldrake was a respected biologist at Clare College, Cambridge, when he began to explore a number of theories that fell outside of accepted science. One of the ideas he was interested in was on precognition. He conducted a number of experiments, and while he was often criticized by mainstream scientists for practicing pseudo-science, I find some of his results interesting enough to investigate. One of Sheldrake's experiments proposes that people display precognitive abilities by sensing or predicting who's about to call them on their phone. Oh, you're looking for Joe Tachyon. Many of us have had that sense. You think about someone, your phone rings, and it's that person. I want to investigate this idea, so I'm going to replicate one of Sheldrake's experiments to collect my own data. I've asked a group of five close friends to join me in my lab. One member of the group will enter a sound booth with a phone. From a different room, the other four friends will roll this dice to decide who calls, pausing to think about their friend before they dial. Guessing who's calling by chance alone allows the subject a success rate of 25%. For his experiment, Sheldrake ran 571 trials with 63 participants using landline phones. Overall, they successfully predicted who was going to call over 40% of the time, well above chance. I think it's Patty. - Hello? - Hello? - Is this Patty? - Yep. I got it right! I'm going to run this trial 25 times for three of the friends and track their predictions. Gonna go with Linda. - Hello? - Hello? Oh crap! My hypothesis is that our subject will predict who is calling more than 25% of the time. When I guessed right when I was in the box, I kind of had a really good feeling. And prior to guessing right, I would get this feeling where I was kind of sure that it would happen. I would visualize them, and then I would get it right, and it kind of kept happening. So then to me, it felt like it was working. Hello? After getting 5 of the first 7 right, my test subject ended up responded correctly 7 of 25 times, or 28%. This is not significantly above chance. I repeat the experiment with two more subjects. Linda. Sandra. It's Phil. I think it's Linda this time. The first responded correctly 5 out of 25 times... Guess who. Ah, I got it right, I got it right! ...a success rate of 20%. This time it's Sandra. My third subject hit 28%... Hello? ...slightly above chance, answering 7 of 25 correctly. - It's Sandra? - Yeah. I got it right! I had a feeling you would. I felt something, you know. It's something that you really can't put your finger on, you can't describe it, you can't quantize it, but it's definitely... definitely something's there, something's going on. These results don't support Sheldrake's idea so far, but I'm still interested to learn more. I'm going to continue my search by investigating another one of Sheldrake's areas of interest: precognitive dreams. These are dreams that appear to predict the future. I've found someone who has been tracking his dreams for decades. I need to meet him. Well, I was really surprised to see that my dreams were valid, that they actually referred to real-world events, because it went completely against everything I believed. When was your first precognitive dream? Well, the first time I had a precognitive dream, I didn't believe it was a precognitive dream. It happened to match up pretty well with some later events, but I still didn't believe it was precognitive. What motivated you to record your dreams? What it was was an accumulation of dreams over a period of years, during which time my wife constantly was referring to this dream and others and saying these are precognitive dreams, you need to take them more seriously. The turning point was the Ramstein Air Show. He had a dream where this guide came and said, "Here, I want to show you something." And he led him to this air field where there were all these planes flying around, and there was a huge fireball. Everybody get back! And later that week, he was watching TV: "We just report this accident, this major, terrible accident at the Ramstein Air Show," and it was in Germany. And I think that really made him sit up and take notice. How many dreams have you recorded? I have 12,417 dreams entered in my database as of this moment, but the most important thing is that the data is there. Do you feel an obligation to tell people about your dreams? I do not feel obliged to help anyone with these dreams. The reason I don't feel this obligation is simply because the precognitive dreams I've had and the other dreams that might be the basis for a warning are very small in number relative to the total number of dreams in my journal. How often do you dream about significant events? In my experience, although sometimes there are news-worthy events in my precognitive dreams, that's really rare. More often it's about really simple things, like what's going to happen when I go to the store. Why do you think you have precognitive dreams? I think it's because as an artist, I engage in activity that improves my ability to focus for a very long period of time. And I think that that type of activity somehow enhances my receptivity to receiving psychic information through my dreams. According to Andrew, 432 or 3.4% of his dreams have been precognitive; a small number, but still intriguing. I need to learn more about this. I'm investigating if it's possible for us to predict the future. Andrew Paquette's dream database is interesting, and motivates me to explore this idea further. I wanna learn more about precognition and telepathy, and how they might be explained scientifically. I've joined Dr. Rupert Sheldrake to investigate. I ask him to start with precognitive dreams. There have been a lot of cases where people have dreamed in advance of disasters. With the famous sinking of the Titanic, there were a few people who didn't get on the boat because they'd had dreams, alarming dreams about the boat sinking before it set off. Before train crashes in the US in the 1950s, someone did a study of dreams and found that before these train crashes, people had dreams of train disasters. So there's already in the psychic research literature good evidence that when spectacular disasters occur, quite a number of people have dreams about them beforehand. In your research, have you found a way to explain this phenomenon? I don't know how to explain precognitive dreams. What they seem to be is tapping into one's own mind in the future. Now, no one knows how to explain that. I myself have a theory called "morphic resonance", which is a theory about memory and involves the transmission of information from the past to the present. Sheldrake believes that memories from all complex organisms may be stored in a morphic field, and is built upon generation after generation. memories are then passed on ugh an energy transfer related to ideas and quantum physics. I take the view that in science, the first step is natural history. So every giraffe, as the embryo develops in the womb of the mother giraffe, is tuning in, I think, to the form of previous giraffes. And when it's born, it tunes into the instincts, the collective memory of previous giraffes. Sheldrake often cites experiments conducted in the 1920s at Harvard as evidence of morphic resonance. He says rats learned a new behaviour in the experiment. They trained rats to avoid shocks and escape a maze. They then introduced new rats and noticed that they managed to avoid the shocks and escape the maze without any training. If rats learn a new trick in one place, for example San Francisco, then rats all around the world will learn the same thing quicker through a kind of resonance on the basis of similarity. Now, how this works nobody knows, but there are quite a few theories as to how it might work. But they all take us into areas of physics which are rather hard to understand, and they're only theoretical speculations. Research in this field slowed dramatically after the rat experiment, as many disagreed with Sheldrake about where the result should lead us. As far as I'm concerned, the interesting question is does it really happen or not? And I'm quite happy to leave the question of what theory fits best to later. Sheldrake's critics argue his theories don't explain biological phenomena as well as other theories. Do you ever have doubts about your theories? I certainly have doubts about my own theories. I don't think that morphic resonance or telepathy... certain facts, I think they're very probable. But you know, maybe there's some alternative explanation for the experimental data. I haven't come across it yet, but I'm open to that possibility. Why do you think telepathy exists? The more I discovered about it, the more it made sense in evolutionary terms. If some birds go out foraging for food and they find food, and other members of the flock are in other places, if they can telepathically tell the other ones where they are and where they found the food, this would make them survive better. So I think it has very good evolutionary reasons for existence. Dr. Sheldrake's ideas on telepathy and precognition have given me plenty to think about. I wonder if my body's cells might learn to be visible through morphic resonance. For now though, I'm interested in another experiment, e with evidence of telepathy. In my quest for evidence, I'd like to replicate Sheldrake's dog experiment. His theory states that dogs and owners are telepathically connected under certain conditions. One of them is that owners and pets with a strong emotional bond will have a stronger telepathic connection. I found three volunteers for my experiment, and I'm going to start by determining the connections they have with their dogs. I'm looking for evidence of precognition or telepathy. I've met with two believers who've experienced and collected data they believe supports both of these phenomena. My first experiment testing phone call predictions did not strongly support their existence. It's time to move onto a new test, and I'm going to attempt to replicate Sheldrake's dog experiment. So, are you ready to find out if you have any powers? Sheldrake's experiment tested a single dog and owner over several months. When the owner had no intention of returning home, the dog was at the window 4% of the time. When the owner did have the intention, the dog was at the window 78% of the time; very strong statistical evidence. For my own experiment, I've set up cameras in the homes of three participants with pet dogs. My name is Andrea. My dog's name is Chaya. So you've had Chaya since she was a puppy? Yes, we... I got her in Mexico when I was living down there. How would you describe your relationship? We're very close. She gets me. My name is Staci. My dog's name is Franny. She's 4 years old. How would you describe the bond between you and Franny? We peacefully co-exist for the most part. She's a loving dog, but she's fairly independent, which is nice for me. My name is Shamso. My dog's name is Kovo. He's 15 months old, and he is my first dog. What are the key elements of your relationship? We've both become dependent on each other emotionally. You know, he depends on me for more than just food or exercise, and I depend on him for his love as well. Sheldrake's idea would suggest that the emotional bond between owner and dog increases the strength of telepathic connection. So my hypothesis is that Chaya and Andrea will have the strongest link because they've been together the longest, a rough indicator of their emotional state. The owners will leave and return only after I signal them. I will send them home at random times, and this should give us data of whether the dogs are telepathically picking up the owner's intention to head home. I'm going to run the experiment over the course of a few days. While my dog experiment runs, I want to investigate a form of precognition some believe we all possess: intuition. One interested party is the US Navy. They've spent millions to investigate why some soldiers seem to be able to predict when danger is around the corner better than others. The Navy hopes that one day, they'll be able to teach sailors to hone these abilities, to preemptively sense danger, save lives, and make them more effective. There are some who believe this form of intuition isn't a connection with the future, it's an ability we all possess called "mind sight", and I'm going to meet the man who studies it. My name is Ron Rensink. I'm a vision scientist. Mind sight is a perceptual experience where people have a feeling of something happening even though they don't see it. Often people report it if they're going down say an alleyway, and they just don't feel it's quite right, something's maybe potentially dangerous. That would be an example of that. What's the science behind mind sight? I actually came across mind sight quite accidentally. I was doing work on a phenomenon called "change blindness", where you can show an image and a blank, and another image and a blank back and forth. And people find that under these conditions, it's very difficult to see a change. And during these experiments, several of our observers spontaneously reported, they said, "Well, when do I hit the key? Do I hit it when I see the change, or when I feel something happening?" After about the 4th or 5th person does this, you go well, okay, let's set up an experiment, and alright, hit the key when you feel it and then when you see it. Can you feel anything changing yet? I know there's something wrong, but it's difficult to say what. Yeah, so that's exactly the mind sight feeling, that there's something going on and you don't know what. So now when we look at these images side by side, you can look at the level of the lake in the background, and it's clearly different in the two pictures. Would you consider mind sight a form of precognition? It's a separate parallel system. It's precognition in as much as it alerts your conscious mind, so it picks it up before you consciously see it. Do you believe people can see into the future? I think it is possible for people to honestly believe they see the future. There's no strong scientific evidence for this at the moment, at least that I know of. But on the other hand, it's also very hard to prove something's impossible. Dr. Rensink may have his doubts about precognition, but his research seems to demonstrate that there is something going on beyond our conscious mind, and I'd like to investigate this further. I found an experiment that might help me do just that. There have been studies done that point to a phenomenon called "presentiment". This is where our bodies subconsciously predict the future, seconds before a significant event, like an accident or seeing a disturbing photo. I need to test this for myself. For this experiment, I will show four volunteers a series of images to test if they can unconsciously predict when a disturbing image will be shown. The original experiment showed that subjects sweat significantly more before a disturbing image was shown, highlighted here in yellow. This was attributed to presentiment. To measure presentiment myself, I've wired my participants to heart rate and skin monitors. My hypothesis is that I will see an increase in their stress responses before seeing a disturbing photo. I don't know if people can predict the future, but I wouldn't rule it out. I tried to predict when a scary image was gonna appear, but I couldn't predict it. I didn't particularly feel any bodily changes within me. Personally I don't feel like I reacted significantly to the experiment. The images didn't really affect me in any traumatic way, I don't think. It's been interesting, but it hasn't really changed my own opinion on intuition and precognition. As it progressed, it was like watching a scary movie where you tense up and you're expecting to see something. Ew, oh my god! But I think it is interesting to question and actively think about intuition. I don't think there was any one moment where I predicted if an image would be scary or disturbing. I don't think I was like anticipating anything. I wouldn't expect my volunteers to consciously notice changes before scary images, but my data does not suggest they are noticing anything unconsciously either. There were no changes in any of the subjects' stress levels before any images were shown. I need to check in on my Sheldrake dog experiment. I set up cameras in the homes of three volunteers to monitor their dogs' behaviour, and see if they have a telepathic connection with their owners. My hypothesis is that Andrea and Chaya will have a stronger telepathic connection than the other two test subjects because they have a stronger emotional connection based on how long they've been together. To test this, I monitor the owners leaving and coming home three times over the course of two days. The owners were signalled by a text message to return at random times. None of the dogs responded when the text messages were sent. This suggests they did not pick up on their owners' intent to leave for home. In all three tests, Franny waited at the door around 30 seconds before Staci arrived home. I observed this was about the time for when Staci opens her front gate until she unlocks her door. The gate is only 25 feet from Staci's apartment. It may be that Franny's move to the door could be triggered by the sound of the gate. This reduces the validity of the data for this trial. Chaya went to the door in one out of three trials. She appears to anticipate Andrea coming home for three-and-a-half minutes. This is long before she would be able to see or hear her. Kovo also went to the door one out of three times, also about three minutes before Shamso arrived home. Very interesting. I hesitate to draw any firm conclusions about precognition or telepathy from my data. My telephone experiment participants guessed at chance, averaging a success rate of 25% over 75 trials. Interestingly, my participants said they could feel something different before correct trials. Is this precognition, or do their feelings come from bias? My presentiment experiment failed to collect any data consistent with subconscious anticipation of disturbing images. In my dog experiment, the first trial may have been compromised by the dog going to the door when her owner made a sound opening the gate. In two of the six remaining trials, dogs waited for their owners for over three minutes, before they could've physically detected them coming home. Is this a telepathic connection between dog and owner, chance, or other variables like foreign sounds or smells? With this small sample size, I cannot draw conclusions, however these results are thought-provoking. This certainly leaves me curious about investigating these ideas further. I need to do more experiments.
