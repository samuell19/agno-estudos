He does kinda look like a Russian thug. If you look at it that way, your captain's a terrorist His face has been drooping, since high school days. Am I right? He kind of looks like a village totem pole! His face expands and contracts ending on the day - When I first met the captain - Quiet,shut up! I almost cuffed him! Cuff what, asshole, shut up, buddy. Having fun? Are you happy? Hey man. You feel good to be on the newspaper? It's a sin to be a captain. Did they whoop you good? I'll go talk to the chief. Forget it, forget it.

Jeon Il-man from Geumcheon Police You're the captain! I'm Det. Ma Seok-do. - Detective... - Hello, hello. My underling can't speak any English at all, thats why we' re in this laughable predicament - What the... - Right. It's all right, should we go for a meal first? Yes, absolutely! Sure thing. - Grab all the luggage! - Your luggage... Hey! Are there any good diners? Jeez... This is only $1? Really? - Yes - That’s incredible How could they travel without any cash? They were haggling nonstop Those bastards are Korean thugs. Korean thugs are dime a dozen. Many Korean shops opened up, and gangs appeared alongside, and violent crimes rose as well. What the fuck is he looking at? Hi.thugs, good to meet you. You travelled a long way to Vietnam Fuck,he's a cop. - Seriously? - You sure? Look at it, they got some drugs and marijuana too. They look fishy. - That’s not marijuana. - I'll be right back. Come on you're mistaken! - But those bastards. - We need a break, man! - Look, they're leaving! - Let them! Are you Koreans? We're having a grand opening, we'll treat you right. Korean again? Gangnam service Ho Chi Minh price! Piss off! Get that out of my face Detective Ma! Yo, Gasoline! Boss...

Who's this bastard? l'm Cooking Oil What the hell... What brings you all here? To catch a criminal? We're on a vacation. Boss you have to be careful. Korean police wield no power here. A ton of gangsters here carry guns around. Guns? Yes.they got guns and machetes this big, things are really different here. Who cares about that, we're on vacation. lt’s not like we'll ever get shot. - Then come have fun! - Sure thing. All right. Gangnam service! At Ho Chi Minh price! CONSULATE GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA Consulate offices aren't all that different from ours. Such a poor condition. At least we got air conditioning. Yeah, it’s really hot here. - How could anyone... - Thank you for waiting! - lt's really hot. - lt sure is. Are there many missing tourist cases? With 30.000 tourists a month, there are quite a bit of those. Some disappear on their own. Money Is always the problem. Please sign here. Once you submit this to the immigration office, you can fly him out after 10 AM tomorrow. Why are there so much paperwork? This is such a unique case. There's no precedent for a criminal turning himself in to a consulate. We freed up a room and kept him here, but it’s such a hassle for us. Why did he turn himself in? He felt a pang of guilt. What? He felt what? A pang of guilt. Pang of.. A pang of guilt. Damn, I made a mistake, I signed 'Jeon Guilt.' Sorry about that. Hey Jong-hoon. Why did you turn yourself in? I'm so very remorseful. I'll receive my punishment in Korea. You want to serve your time in Korea? You sure eat like a snake. Captain. To the Truth Room. Here? Okay, one sec. Give me that! All ready! Keep a look out. Okay! Relax, it’s okay Det. Ma can find out everything. What? Find what out? Why did you turn yourself in? I felt a pang of guilt... A pang of guilt? J- J- JD! J- J- JD! JD tried to kill me! Lee JD, that idiot you kept around? He's here, yeah? No. No? Det. Ma can find out everything. Let’s take one of your ears. My ear, my ear! Hey De. Ma go easy on him! He's got too many ears can take one of them. Buddy, spill it at once Why did JD tried to kill you? Hurts! lt hurts! I messed with JD's girl... Bastard, rip his ear off. lf JD is here, then Ki-baek is too? The three of you are a set, you punk! No... All right, don't answer. Even if you don't say it, Det. Ma can find out everything. Are you doing that thing? Hold on,wait! You really shouldn't Don't move, stay still, you'll get hurt, If you move, you might die. Don't kill me! ls there construction? My eardrum's about to burst, stop it, it hurts! You're not sure? But you're sure about JD? Yes... I don't think we should go and get him on our own. Bringing in two perps instead of one is instant promotion for you. No, we got no jurisdiction here. Investigation and arrest are all illegal. Wel I just tell him nicely to turn himself in, that's all. If you're involved, it's an investigation! Blind dates you go on? Those are investigations! What did Yoo say? He keeps saying bullshit, Captain. I'll submit this to the immigration office then. Yes,sure. I have a friend in Ho Chi Minh I gotta meet... I see. Do you know where this is? It's not too far from here. But it's a rough neighborhood. I'm okay with that. He's rougher. It’s over here. People are home. It’s locked. - Locked? - Yeah. It's open now. How could you break that! JD, Jong-hoon spilled his guts. Let’s go home... What the hell?! Jeez... Goddamn, what happened? This is a murder. This messes things up. Call Mr. Park immediately. Buddy,get the hell up! You fucking dare to lie to me? What's going on? JD was murdered, asshole. What have you been doing? Tell me everything. How's a beating first? Sir, deputy, this could spark a big problem. Captain, can you please stop him? Don't do it. Let's not do this, I'll release you, just go. What? I think that's the best way, get out of here. Go, come on, go. Detective, I turned myself in. Turned yourself in? l won't accept it, just go. Get over here! Get the hell out! I turned myself in, goddammit! "Goddammit"? You swore at me? - Detective! - I'll escort you out. - Help! Please help! - Let’s go, let’s go home! Wait, please! What are you doing?! I'm sorry, I'm so sorry! We kidnapped a man here with a guy named Kang Hae-sang! Who? Kang Hae-sang? He lured us to kidnap Choi Yong-gi, who runs a resort business. Choi came from money. That young bloke was a chump but spent money like a champ! Give me that. This is only $50.000. And this is barely $90.000. Which is less than $20.000 per head. No fucking way. Asswipe, what happened? We went through all that mess just for this? Speak your mind. Mr. JD, You said your friends are pros, but they're amateurs. - What? - Amateurs? Maybe they're simpletons. Fucking hell?! What did you just say, asshole? If it wasn't for Choi's money, you'd already be dead. I went too easy on you. Fuckers. Don't want to make money? There's a limit to my patience. - Du-ik, you... - Fucking bitch! Stop it! What in the world?! Get that bastard! - Stop right there! - You fucker! We'll continue this chat. Get that fucker! Goddamn, you! You can't lose him! Stop right there! Get up! Grab him! Son of a bitch! You fucking bitch! Fuck, get over here! Fucking bastard! You got a death wish? Wait, please! I'll pay you $100.000 per head that’s a promise! Fuck... $100.000per head! For real? You sure? I got $200.000 in my hotel room, and some gold bars too. So what's the passcode?! 2963! 2963! 2963? That's the real one? We could've saved so much-trouble if you let us borrow some earlier. Sorry. Why didn't you say so, what are we doing here? We could open a resort without that bastard! Look at this fucker. If you lie, you're as good as dead. He's dead? Are you out of your mind? How could you kill him? We gotta get paid before chopping him up, asshole! Fucking bastard, money... What the fuck?! One less head means more for all. What are you doing. dig properly, asshole! Working overseas sure is nice. Cops are loose, easy to get the job done $200.000 and gold bars from the hotel safe. That’s all? I could squeeze more out ot him. You there. Hold on. Mr. Choi here's your son's arm, send $500.000 and he's yours. And then? 2 days later, he got paid, and JD and I just ran. With money in his hand, he turned evil. For a few days now, I sensed men following me. I think Kang sent his men to kill me! I'm sorry. You should've said so earlier! That’s why you turned yourself in? Yes... Kang must've killed JD. If he finds out that I'm here I'm dead as well. Please send me to Korea, boss! Now what then? We heard everything Let's find the bodies first. He's so excited. Write down the address here. - Address? - Yeah. Deputy Captain, this will cause headaches for a lot of people. Yeah, but l still need the address. It’s okay, it’s okay. Captain, this has to be handed over to the local police. Or he will be deported! Yes, please make that happen. Pardon? Please get him deported! Captain, I'm begging you. GEUMCHEON POLICE Boss, are you having fun? See if anything pops up on one Kang Hae-sang, and a missing person report on one Choi Yong-gi. Kang Hae-sang and Choi Yong-gi? Any other details to go on? Nothing else. Get on it. Yes, I understand. Thank you. So, what did they say? Cops don't sympathize with other cops. lt'll take about a month before a warrant is issued. Kang will fleer te another country before then! Then what can.we do? We're not in Korea. What can we do? Shouldn't you do Something? Nothing can be done. Like what? Nothing can be done Damn it! Where are you going? Where is he off to now? Mr. Park,please go stop him, he probably won't listen. Have you seen this person? I don't know what you mean. Can you understand him? A few months ago, I think. Seok-do, I now I can't stop you, but this isn't Garibong district. Hey,hey! Wait a minute! - Stop it,man! - Stop doing that! What’s the matter with you? Just let me find this prick, move out of the way Wait! Det. Ma,you really can't do this Will you be responsible for any problems? This is clearly an illegal activity! If this country's laws can't protect our people, then shouldn't we? Seok-do, you're right, but... Am l wrong? Call the Cops. We'll all be arrested. Christ, is it even here? Are you gardening? Hurry up and do it right! Here,here! lt's a worm... Damn it. What's this? Damn! Found it, it's right there! What? Holy cow! I got one here too! Another one? We're in hell, I'll notify the authorities. Four bodies in total. I really did come here on a vacation. Detective, what's up? Have you heard of-Kang Hae-sang/ What? You're after that bastard too? How do you know him? A local Korean thug named Raku was looking for Kang about 3 days ago. Raku? - Where is he now? - I don't know - Is something up? - Look into it and call me ASAP! What is Korean detective doing here?! ls there a law in your country?! We'd like to apologize. You'll be responsible for this. Go back to your hotel! - What? Hotel? - What did he say? I call your... We'ree cops too! How could we stand back when our people are butchered?! Captain! Even if we don't have any jurisdiction... Easy,easy.they're pulling out their guns. But even so... I'll sort it out here, please stay at the hotel. Okay, I understand, sorry, sorry. I'm getting this fucker no matter what. If we bring him to the consulate, we could put him on a flight. How do we catch him? You got a plan? Come with me. So humid.. You're here? Where? Over here! Boss! Let’s go. Find it at once! There should be $500.000 in cash,so search thoroughly. You saw him with your own eyes/ Yes. I'm sure. I saw him myself. I saw Kang leave this morning. I found it! Good, you may go. Okay... Thank you. lt’s a lot. Look at this fucker. That’s gotta be way more than $1M. How many did he kill? Let’s send the money back first. Okay. Yes, we found it. What brings you here? A bus brought us here. Wow, just look at them. Look, a sea of Koreans. Hey,buddy! Come here! What is it? Fetch me Raku or Roku or whatever. Who are you people? They're all Korean hooligans. Boys, gather around! Oh, you guys are cops?

Stay the fuck back! Nobody move! Don't you dare to move! Stay where you are, assholes! Choose your words carefully, or this is your last day. Yes, sir. Speak properly. Why did you look for Kang Hae-sang? We were paid to track him down, I don't know the details. So who hired you?! Some mercs from Korea, that’s all l know! Mercs? Yes, sir. So did you find Kang/ He guided them. Yo, who are you? I'm Cheeky. You fucking cheeky monkey, get over here! - I'll be back! - See you soon! Where are you, sir? We're heading to Kang's location. Did you find anything? I asked an friend in the Intelligence for Kang's files and strangely, Choi was never reported missing. Yeah? What's the deal with his family? What does his father do? Choi Choon-baek, head of Joeun Capital, he's a glorified loan shark. Choi Choon-baek, I think I've heard of him. He's infamous in Myeongdong, and main business is lending money to corporations, daily cash transaction amount is said to be in millions. But he never reported his own son missing? Should I dig in further? Yeah,look into it. Okay. What did he say? it looks like Choi's father sent mercs to kill the kidnappers. Let’s get ready. Look at this punk. Die! You from Korea? You took my money? Who sent you? Fuck you, asshole. Choi... Choi Choon-baek! Choi Choon-baek? Yong-gi's father? JOEUN CAPITAL Mr. Choi, this is Kang Hae-sang. You're not dead yet? You sent men to kill me? You took my money and killed my son you thought you'd be safe? I said you'd get him back, but didn't say he'd be alive. I... will kill you. Why did you take my money? Return it. Or I'm coming to Korea. His manners are fucked-up. Dude, wait a minute! All ready! Why did you bring the gun? i forgot to return this to him. Wait for me! The door's open. Dang,he got wind of it and fled already. Holy shit! What the hell? What's all this? How many are dead here/ I think we're too late. Damn it.. Why are there so many bags?

By the way, how long do we need to be locked up here? Hey, Hong-seok! Are you all right, boss? How's the captain? Captain's good, any updates on Kang? The Intelligence has been gathering information on kidnapping and murder cases in Southeast Asia against Korean tourists. The Philippines, Cambodia, etc. All four cases resemble Kang's MO. Make contact, get friendly kidnap,then demand ransom, but even after ransom, none of them came back. How many in total? Four have been identified so far. Also, boss, the chief wants you to stop causing trouble.. All right! I'm hanging up! Captain,how are you feeling? It's okay.he's fine, he's a crybaby. I told you stay at the hotel... Oh man..

Help me! The Korean detectives in custody ran away! i need backup! Back up, back up, back up! Motherfucker.. Buddy,where i sang Hae-sang? Are you gonna take the fall for the eight bodies we found? The local police wil kill you if you stay here. Buddy! Tell me where Kang is, and I'll repatriate you. Effective immediately! You'll be deported from Vietnam! Take him to the airport! No cuffs needed! I can't! l won't go! Hold up, stop! Stop! - Seok-do! - Out of the way! Don't do that, come on! All right, we have to go! - Go! -We have to! - Go where? - To Korea! Why there?

Everything is searchable. Asshole! Sit down, you illegal alien, come sit down. I've been legal so long, and ever since l almost died, I only do legal work. Finding work for illegal alien is what you call legal? Enough, we got no time, give me intel on any vessels coming in from China. I left that life so long ago! What's with your hand? You rude mofo. I've had it with you, it's been a while. Here. Listen here. Not coming? I'm not the same Jang Isu from before! One. If you mess with me, l won't take it on my ass! Two. Yeah... So anything came in since yesterday? All right, I'm hanging up. Who was that? He's known as Captain One-eye He's the only game in town when it comes to China. SKIPPER KIM GYO-BUM He said a new vessel came into Goongpyong port. - Call Hong-seok. - Calling. Hong-seok, where are you? Go to Goongpyongport and get all security cam footages. Yeah,one sec. And?!

KOREAN COPS WERE STABBED IN VIETNAM With your order, l sort it out with the media. All right, go on. Ma Seok-do! I told you to keep a low profile. You made a big ass mess to fuck with me, right? No way. I was just trying to catch a perp. Why were you trying to catch a perp there?! They got cops there too! And you, I sent you to keep an eye on him, yet you fueled the fire, and shot a gun too! l barely shot any, it was busted. Why is this being handed over to Foreign Affairs? We're about to close it with security cam evidence, how could you hand it all over now? Yeah! I'm powerless on this! lt’s no use telling me! Always so powerless, that's so weird. Our chief didnt read our report thoroughly again right? - Again?! - Yeah! No wonder What do you mean? Jeez, a total of four bodies were uncovered in Vietnam. Of the missing Korean tourist cases in the Philippines and Cambodia, Kang is suspected of tour of them! Four! This guy is in a class of his own! That’s why Foreign Affairs is taking over! if that's the end of it, your call is the right one. There's something else? To seek revenge for the death of his son, Choi's father sent Korean mercs to kill Kang and his men! But Kang killed even those guys, and he's here to find Choi Choon-baek! If Kang suddenly shows up, would Choi just stay back? Isn't it insane? lt sure is. Choi will send out gangsters, Seoul will turn into a bloodbath! Then well be on TV. If that happens, we're all dead.

Come here, asshole. It's been a while. Who are these fucks? Pay us more for them. What's that? Crap! Hong-seok! B1! Choi is being kidnapped! Out of the way! Shit! B1! Equus! Equus! You fucker! Stop right there! Stop... Are you all right? Did you get the plate number? Yes... Is the camera on? Do you see this? His-head comes off tomorrow. Here. Okay. Have $2 M ready by tomorrow. Keep your phone on. When did you receive this? Last night by a courier. - Rewind it a bit. - Okay. - They're brothers? - Yes. Contract killing, armed robbery... These guys can't be recycled. They fled tothe Philippines with warran,ts for their arrest nd they were on Interpol's radar over a Korean murder case. I checked their records, and their stay in the Philippines overlaps with Kang's by 6months. Was there one near where the car was found? We're not getting any support, so go toll san and look around with patrols over there. Understood. Are we okay on our own? If things go sour, we'll be on the hook. There's no time. He and Yong-gi may not be clean, but they're my family. Please do whatever it takes to arrest him. What can l do to help? So the thing is.. We can't transfer the ransom. Once he sends it overseas it’s untraceable. and we can't ensure your husband's safety. So we have to make the trade in person, we need you to lure him. Don't get worked up while on the phone. We'll guide you along the way... I'm sorry to make you do this. No need to be sorry, there's no other way. We got the call, it's him! Get ready! - Quiet down,quiet! - One moment. One,two, three. Please answer. Hello? This is Kang Hae-sang. This will go smoothly if you follow my orders. Is the money ready? I'll send you my account info. - Are you an idiot? - What? Why should l pay you $2M? Hold on. Give her a minute. You bastard. You killed my son even after receiving the ransom. There's no guarantee you'll let my husband go, so why should I send you money? So you won't even try? If not, your husband will die for sure. I'd thank you for it. What? Buddy, you killed my son. If you kill my husband too, who'll end up with his money? You'll flee the country, no? Am l right? I'll give you $2 M in cash. Trade with him in person. I'll hand it over when l see him alive. You're a great negotiator. Okay. Bring $2 M in a suitcase tomorrow. If I find a tracker, or if you mess with me, I'll kill your husband and come after you. 1 DRIVER Understand? Come to Ilsan Central Intersection by 1 PM tomorrow alone. Did you get that? I can't drive, I'll need a driver. Jesus Christ... No good? No deal? Just one driver? Okay Let’s do this right and keep your hus.. Bad manner runs in the family. Could I get some water? - Water! - Yes, sir. You did great. Here, have some water. That lady is no joke. I really want to get this bastard. So who should we use as the driver? We can't use one of ours he'll clue in. Then who? If we use a pushover, this will go sour very fast. Fake marriage isn't a bad thing. All new lives start out that way.
