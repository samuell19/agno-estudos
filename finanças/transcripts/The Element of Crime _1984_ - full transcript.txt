[man chanting in Arabic] [man:] Fantasy is OK, but my job is to keep you on the right track. We are after the facts. You seem to return to Cairo and me whenever you have a problem. Two months ago you left Cairo, your wife everything for a police job in Europe. Now you are back, haunted by headaches. If you want me to help you get rid of these headaches we must go back two months in time back to where it all started. For all I know, Europe has become an obsession to you. What was the name again? [woman:] Mr. Fisher. An obsession, Mr. Fisher, a state of mind. I have no doubt the stay in Europe has been painful painful. So you must go into that part of your memory. It's hard for you to remember, you say. Yes yes. So to help you to remember we have agreed to try hypnosis. Hypnosis is a sound method. It cannot fail. If you feel uneasy, tired, worried I'll bring you out of it. Just ask me. No problem. No problem at all. I want you to go back two months in the time. I want you to leave Cairo the sand, the desert Hoppitiher Nile Nilehralik. It's too much for Europeans. Yes. You're going to see Europe again for the first time in 17 years. [Fisher:] I'm going to see Europe again for the first time in 13 years. But Europe is not the same. I have arrived at dusk. The trip has made me restless. I cannot sleep. Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink. [therapist:] The story. What is the story? - Hello? - [Fisher:] I'm a policeman. I've finally been called back to Europe to solve a murder case. - Hello? - They told me I was able. That's all I know. I'm looking up Osborne - Hello. - ...the only one I want to see again. I've brought him something from Egypt. Where's the stairs? You've moved the fucking stairs. [therapist:] You must tell me everything, Mr. Fisher. What do you see? Is anyone there? [Fisher:] There's a smell in the moist corridor, like burnt leather. The housekeeper is leading me on. She's grown old. [wheezing] [Fisher:] Good evening. It's Fisher. It's been a long time. [wheezing, coughing] Fisher, for Christ's sake. [coughing continues] You really thought I wouldn't recognize you? So, tell me about yourself. Italy: You went to Italy. - Cairo. - Really? - Just a minute. - [wind howling] - The wind's picking up. - Shh shh shh You were wise to go. Best away. They treated you badly. But Cairo? How are things at the academy? I haven't taught for years. The teaching was "restructured". That was actually the word they used. I suppose I was restructured too, hmm? - But now I'm quite content. - Did you see anybody out there? Kramer's found a job for me. Why not? You're an able man, Fisher. Not many left with your training. Kramer knows. Yes, I must admit, I'm really looking forward to it. "The Element of Crime" in Egyptian. Your paper: the translation took two years footnotes and everything, the complete work. Without asking my permission? It didn't occur to you that I'd like to know what happened to my book? I did. I wrote you. - I would remember. - You replied. I don't recall that. My wife died. I sold all my books and papers. Eine Kugel kam geflogen. Gilt sie mit order? Gilt sie dir? Yes. I finally decided to get married. She died for me. [Fisher:] I'm sorry. She could do nothing by halves. She certainly knew how to be remembered. It's the most important in thing the family. I had a wife in Cairo. Why do men leave their wives? I cannot understand it. It's incomprehensible to me. [Fisher:] The city was sanding over. It was impossible to stay. She was born there. She couldn't leave. I was the last European to go. A mixed marriage, hmm? I find it hard to talk about these things. I loved her as much as I could, and that's all. It was such an extraordinary joy for me, Fisher: the bosom of a family, cheerful smile [wind howling] I don't know what to say about your books. Hmm. They guided me. Not just in my police work: my whole way of thinking. - [tapping] - No no no no. I was furious when they removed my books from the academy library. Now I understand. I wrote fiction. It wasn't science. What I wrote was naive, dangerous. The worst thing that can happen in the name of science is when the system becomes all-important. We always looked for the element of crime in society. But why not look in the very nature of man? So much has happened in Europe. This book has become dangerous. [phone ringing] Excuse me. [man on phone:] Fisher? Back from the promised land. I thought I'd find you at the old man's. Straight in there, eh? Now, let's see what you can do, Fisher. They've just found another mutilated body: a little girl. Somebody's gutted her this time, down at the harbor. So chop chop: fifteen minutes. [dial tone] [water running] I'm sorry. I had to take my medicine. It was Kramer for you? He's a busy man. [stirring liquid] He's very important these days. [Fisher's voice:] Kramer's nothing. [therapist:] Is this the job Kramer has in mind for you? [Fisher's voice:] It's incredible. Europe lies dormant. There's a man with a horse harnessed to a wagon. the wagon loaded with apples, very peaceful. [girl:] They found her up in the coal. They're bringing her down now. Here comes a candle To light you to bed. Here comes a chopper To chop off your head. Chip chop chip chop The last one's dead. [Fisher's voice:] Someone is asleep up there. [therapist:] But, Mr. Fisher, I have to know more about Kramer. What did you mean, "He's nothing"? Nobody move. This is Chief of Police Kramer speaking. - Nobody move. - [Fisher:] I know him from the old days the police academy. [sirens wailing] He was always a pain and now he's chief of police. Fisher, good of you to turn up. I see you found your friend Osborne then. I didn't see you at headquarters. Nancy boy. Funny world, Fisher. You were always so much more promising than me. Now I'm chief of police. Did you know, I was the one who offered Osborne the job when he was ditched from the school? I've got the world by its balls, Fisher: the short and curlies. [horse neighing] [neighing continues] [Fisher:] This is the clumsiest police job I've ever seen. - Shh - [Kramer:] Yeah, all right, Fisher. Let's say, clumsiness is a principle which we use. There's a special kind of evil around. You can feel it. You've seen the changes everywhere. Believe me, Fisher, the same thing has happened in these people. You know what the Dive is? A jump from a height with a rope around the ankle. They call it a ritual. I call it crime. We've got to keep them under. [Kramer:] You've always been a good boy, Fisher. All work and no play. You want to understand everything. Why did you ever try for the force? I didn't think blood was in your line. Your people have never known joy. Do you know what this is? This is the difference between you and me. Look out. [girl whimpering] Have you gone completely mad? [whimpering continues] - Why did you run away? - I don't know. There's a girl been murdered up here. - I was the one who told them where to look. - You're a dreamer, Fisher. - Did you see who did it? - No, I'd just arrived. Did you know her? She shouldn't have come here tonight. I tried to tell her. She was my sister. We sell lotto. You don't seem to understand. Your methods are old-fashioned and too risky. Lottery tickets? Lottery tickets? We're the ones who are getting killed. She knew the risks. The lotto murders: Someone's killing the ticket sellers. So we stick together. We always walk in twos and threes. He said he'd buy a lot of lotto if she came alone tonight. She said it was stupid to be scared. - Was there a little figure? - [Fisher:] A little figure? That's his way. Don't you know? - Did you see him when your sister spoke to him? - From far away. - When? - Yesterday. - Would you recognize him? - No. Can I take my sister's tickets? Sure. Shouldn't I have been informed about this? I decide what happens. You don't make a move without me. I'm your boss now, not Osborne so don't step out of line, Fisher. [siren wailing] When a job like this really hits the mark... I've been out there screwing God. [snickering] Look at the lights. It's OK, Fisher. It's still OK. [Fisher:] I can feel the talisman in my pocket. It's slippery in an unpleasant way. I've never seen a body mutilated like that: the lotto murders. [therapist:] Relax, Mr. Fisher. You're doing fine,just fine. [Fisher:] Really? Fisher. Inspector Fisher. Can you show me to my office? - Kramer sent for me. I want an autopsy. - Just one? Please hold the card a little bit higher so that we can stamp it. [laughs, panting] Osborne had me come back Osborne, the great Osborne! If I've heard about him, I've already forgotten it. Just minding my own business when the new sheriff rides into town. He walks into that saloon, pulls out his six-shooter and he says, "I'm going to clean up this mess." And I believe he will, because he's got the fastest draw I ever did see. How did I get involved with a couple of assholes like you? That's not even funny. Take a look at yourself. [Fisher:] Headquarters. I've been longing for these endless corridors with nowhere just around the corner. I don't know why. I've got some unpacking to do. The office is familiar. It used to be Osborne's in the old days. There was a videotape in the machine. [man on TV:] Please, Mr. Osborne, hold it a little higher. Four murders, a month between each, talismans all the bodies mutilated in the same obscene manner the disfigurements never publicly revealed, the work of the same man. I've been feeling old lately. Chief of Police Kramer has agreed that we bring in a man with the expertise to handle a case like this. Does that mean that you accept the criticism that you're primarily a man of theory? Excuse me. Do you have a comment on the Dive, Chief Kramer? Dear Osborne, thanks for the loan. We think the pictures are part of tailing report 19040616-JJ concerning Harry Grey. [Fisher:] I'm trying to remember an easier way to the archives. There must have been one long ago. The note in the tube mail has made me curious to see what's in this Harry Grey file. Osborne had something going on. I want to find out what. So far no one's told me much about anything. I didn't expect much from Kramer but Osborne should have said something. I'm going through the motions and just drawing blanks. I can think of things I'd rather do than attend the autopsy on the little girl. [therapist:] But it's part of the routine, Mr. Fisher, isn't it? [Fisher:] Cairo seems far, far away. It's a very beautiful corpse. You can see that. The corpse is impersonal. What interests the scientist is the marks of the murderer. We are looking at the workings of a mind, a man's mind. That's the thrill of it. [Fisher:] Is it a lotto murder? Oh, yes, no question. She's cut up in precisely the same way. Can you not take a rest now? [Fisher:] Could it be an imitation? [doctor:] If so it's a good imitation. There is one thing about the killings which hasn't been mentioned in the press: that death has taken place before the disfiguring. What was the cause of death? Suffocation: Look. These lottery dealers are weak persons and [shout] and unprotected invalids and young women and so on. This disfiguring: Was it done with a knife? A broken bottle. Does it shock you? [dog whimpering] [Fisher:] I've been out of practical police work for some years. [doctor:] But you are a professional. We both are. Our admiration is for the criminal, not the victim. She's gone. He remains out there leaving his little traces, his own little system. He cuts and leaves himself bare. [phone ringing] Where did you get your training? Auschwitz? Mr. Fisher, it's from Osborne's house. There were those who did. . [woman on phone:] Mr. Fisher, you must come at once. I think something's happened to Mr. Osborne. After you left, he told me not to let anybody in - [knocking] - but just now I heard him arguing with somebody and now he doesn't answer. [gasping] Tora. Tora. [gun splashes] [gasping] I fell. I get these attacks, you know? That'll be all. I don't know how to explain this, Fisher. I don't know if you understand the meaning of a word like "expiation." I feel I have to pay somehow. Do you know what I mean? You don't want to know. [Fisher:] Earlier in the evening, I was called out to a homicide: a girl. The case resembled something you were working on before you retired. Mom does it. Dad does it. - Horses have a try and - I think I'll come back tomorrow. [Osborne muttering] Who's Harry Grey? Yes, that's a good question: Who is Harry Grey? Harry Grey doesn't exist anymore and the lotto murders are a closed book. Those murders were ritualistic bizarre the fruit of a sick brain a maniac. But they were systematic systematic to the last detail inhuman. Now, this is the only existing picture of H.G. There were four murders. It sometimes helps to study the geography of a crime, remember? But there was a connection with a three-year-old tailing report. A man called Harry Grey suspected of subversive activity wrongly, it turned out. I wondered if he'd made preparations those three years earlier: you know, groundwork groundwork for the lotto murders. A field trip. Oh, bugger! I used the old methods: I lay in ambush and waited for him. He must have known. He tried to escape in his car. I followed. He drove fast in spite of the wet and the dark, surprisingly well went into a slide and came off the road. He hit a concrete pillar. He died in the flames. It was as if he wanted it like that. I couldn't help him. Just one question: Who's this picture supposed to convince? Me or you? These talismans have been seen all over the papers. Anybody could make one like it. This is the route according to the three-year-old tailing report. These are the four sites of the murders. Halberstadt, Friedingen, Oberdorf and Neukalkau: as you see, the corners of a perfect square. Four murders with approximately one month between them. Grey is dead and his work completed a nice little geometric puzzle. - Past and present. - No, Osborne. That's not good enough. You deport a man for 13 years in the sand. You bring him back to Europe where something apparently has gone wrong. He looks up his old teacher a teacher who has unfortunately gone mad. You asked me who Harry Grey was. I told you, Harry Grey is dead. I don't rule out this able-bodied man gets work with the police force. The only thing is, there's no police force. The old teacher has been threatened. He's like a dog. He's scared. He changes the facts to cover for a criminal. Furthermore, he advocates the brilliant theories of his youth. - That's treason. - That's worse. I can see you're scared. You're being threatened. Where's the tailing report? Crime today is like a chemical reaction: It can only happen in the right environment. Intelligence and sensitivity must be affected out there. Don't talk to me in those bloody cliches. The academy days are over. [Fisher:] I found this girl cut up in Innenstadt harbor. Innenstadt is on the square too, right here in the middle. Grey is alive. [Osborne:] So don't tell me if the square describes a closed figure, this must be an opening. Very touching. You're happy now, aren't you? But take care, Fisher. Police work has become so much more dangerous now than it was in your day. I know I'm a silly old bugger. For Christ's sake, you'll do what you think is right anyway. [Fisher:] We've never quarrelled before. [woman:] He really cares for you, Mr. Fisher. I know. He's so scared even of the smallest things the house and the dark. He never rests. He just walks around up there. Listen. [footsteps] Is it always as dark as this, this time of year? There are no seasons anymore. The last three summers haven't been summers. The weather changes all the time. It never alters. Would he hurt himself? This morning he asked me to burn all his books and papers. Tell me about his wife. They were married a few years before she died, right? Did he say that? Suddenly, when he came back a month ago, he was married. She stayed a week. She isn't dead. She just left. [woman:] Have you seen the child? It's hers from a previous marriage. She left it. How can anybody do that? Shh There, there now. Now now shh There. [humming] [baby talk] [humming continues] [therapist:] Talk to me, Mr. Fisher. [Fisher:] I've found the missing tailing report. Harry Grey has been here to frighten Osborne to destroy any information on him. Osborne was getting too close. I owe it to him to go on with this. [therapist:] How can this tailing report help you? It's a surveillance report on an innocent little trip that Harry Grey took years before the lotto murders. [Fisher:] If you'd read "The Element of Crime," you'd know. [commotion on TV] [man on TV:] Let Osborne speak. [jeers, booing] Let the man speak. Remember, gentlemen. We are Europeans. "The Element of Crime" sets out a series of mental exercises designed to improve our understanding of the behavioral pattern of the criminal. [man on TV:] Understanding? Don't you know what's going on out there? [Osborne on TV:] Next question. "The Element of Crime" is a method based on the reconstruction of a known part of a criminal's life. It is, if you like, a psychological identification that enables a policeman through his own mind, to work his way into the unknown activities of the criminal to work his way into the crime in question. [man on TV:] That's a dangerous way of reaching understanding. [Osborne on TV:] We always run the risk of being corrupted. The morality of the police is no different from that of society. [man on TV:] You claim that crime can only arise in a specific element. - [Osborne on TV:] Yes. Next question. - [man:] Metaphysics. I never claimed that the method had been completely developed. [Osborne:] What am I doing here? [man singing in Arabic] [phone ringing] [woman:] If you leave now, you will never come back. [singing continues] [phone ringing] - Hello? - [man on phone:] Osborne? - We can open the locker now. - Hello? This is the Hotel Schatz in Halberstadt. I've been thinking: If you really think it's important What locker? Harry Grey's locker. Isn't this Mr. Osborne? [man on TV:] Why don't you defend yourself, Osborne? I'm on my way. [commotion on TV] [car engine starts] [Fisher:] I am on my way, chasing a man: Harry Grey. I'm carrying the tailing report like a recipe book listing all the ingredients needed to make Harry Grey. I know everything he did on his field trip three years ago. [tires screeching] [sheep bleating] I'm on my way to Halberstadt - [horn honking] - to the locker. [therapist:] Were you asleep when the telephone rang, Mr. Fisher? [Fisher:] I wouldn't call it sleep. I wouldn't call it sleep. - You're not Osborne. - Will you open the locker? Are you from the police too? It's a very nice hotel. We have cola. If you like yellow girls, I can get you yellow girls. The locker. Is this connected with the lotto murders? They found the body behind Frau Gerda's house. Where did you get that from? The tourists are crazy about them. When they've seen the site of the murder they want something to take home with them. What can you tell me about Harry Grey? He was a nice man. He tipped the maid. He had a car. We never had no trouble with Mr. Grey. He only stayed here a short time. OK So many tourists come here. I can't remember them all. Let's get one thing straight. Not many tourists come here. This is a dump. "This is a dump"? [Fisher:] Halberstadt is everything I thought it would be... [Fisher:] Halberstadt is everything I thought it would be only worse. The place has three attractions: the Hotel Schatz the site of the lotto murder and Frau Gerda's whorehouse. [wind howling] [bell clanging] [woman speaking German] Can we offer you anything to eat, mister? Did you feel the sheets? It's not a dry wind. This is the cow with the crumpled horn That tossed the dog That worried the cat That killed the rat That ate the mold That lay in the house That Jack built. This is the maiden all forlorn That milked the cow With crumpled horn That tossed the dog That worried the cat That killed the rat That ate the mold That lay in the house That Jack built. This is the maiden all forlorn that Milked the cow with the crumpled horn That tossed the dog That worried the cat That killed the rat That ate the mold What is your name? You can call me Harry. My name's Kim. What do you see, Harry? A line of washing left out to dry. It never dries. She brings it in wet. Do you like Halberstadt? I'd rather live in a hole in the ground. I hate Halberstadt. Do you want me now? They say that people living in Innenstadt are evil. I'm going to fuck you back to the Stone Age. Harry came to Halberstadt and stayed with Kim die halbe Nacht. [moaning] [sloshing] [Fisher:] Kim was gone when I woke up at Frau Gerda's. I couldn't have slept more than a few minutes. I took the ferry on my way to Friedingen and suddenly she's here again,, standing by the side of the road. She looks wet. So this is the Stone Age. Are you going to Innenstadt? Not right away. I'm going to Friedingen. Where did you go? I'd like to come with you. You're a cop, aren't you? [grunting, moaning] [Fisher:] Do you believe me? ...that I'm in the middle of Europe, screwing a Volkswagen 1200? [therapist:] I believe you. I thought I remembered you, Mr. Grey. You still owe us for two nights and the medicine. Put it on my bill. The same room as last? It's a single. What medicine? Salycin, quite a lot, for headaches. When you were here last you turned on the stairs and said "My face is a city." What did you mean by that? What city? My face or your face? What are you talking about? My face or your face? What city? What city? Why did you write "Harry Grey"? Is that your name? [therapist:] Yes, why did you write "Harry Grey"? [Fisher:] This is the next step in Osborne's method. The tailing report tells me that Harry Grey was here. Maybe he's the one who chipped the sink. I like this room. It's a nice room. It's a room full of ...headaches? - What are you doing? - Mapping out a route. Coffee? No, thanks. I think you should have some. [Kim:] I couldn't stay in Halberstadt. It's always 3:00 in the morning. Do you know what I mean? [Fisher:] I believe in joy. Do you want me to say that again? I believe in joy. [Kim:] I want to show you something. [therapist:] What is it you want to show me? [Fisher:] Kim's taking me for a ride. [Therapist Chuckles:] Down the drain into the tunnel of love. [Kim:] They're all right for screwing but you feel terrible afterwards. Well you and your wife: what happened? We got sanded over. And you just left? I remember a little tattoo, a blue star. Where? Above her right breast. - Did you like it? - No. Maybe I did. I remember we were together. People move on. You have to survive. No, no. [Fisher:] We're having sex. Kim's drug works. I feel fine. [therapist:] But this isn't what you are after. Let me get one thing clear. You're trying to reconstruct Harry Grey's headaches by means of the side effects of these pills. [Fisher:] I need something to work on. [Kim:] Don't move. [groaning] [groaning continues] [dog whimpering] I told you, lie still. No. No. I said I wouldn't be home right away. OK. Now I want you to do something. I want you to arrive on the bus. I mean it. [Fisher:] At this point three years ago Harry Grey's mistress arrived to accompany him on his journey. [therapist:] But three years ago the buses were running, weren't they? Are you sure this is police work? [Fisher:] I'm sure that on the trip covered in the tailing report Harry Grey was planning the lotto murders even though it might appear quite innocent to you. Harry Grey I've waited half an hour for you. The bus is late. You're looking forward to being with me again. You've asked the driver to drop you off at Friedingen. You are in your summer clothes, but it's still stifling. The bus is crowded and the windows won't open. Last time we were together, we had a little quarrel. But you're sure everything will be OK now. There's a dog somewhere on the bus. [dog whimpering] [bus driver:] Next stop: Friedingen. [chattering, traffic noises] - Aren't you glad to see me? - You know I like to see you. "You know I like to see you, Harry." You know I like to see you, Harry. Do you like me a little now? [therapist:] Who's following you, Mr. Fisher? You should try to sleep a little. [Fisher:] But I can't sleep. [Kim:] It's all those pills. Try counting. [Fisher:] One, two three, four - [Kim sings] - five, six - [continues counting] - [therapist:] Mr. Fisher, where are you? [Fisher:] Europe. It must be. ten, eleven, twelve thirteen, fourteen, fifteen - [counting continues] - [therapist:] Do you wish to continue? [Fisher:] I have to. [therapist:] How do you picture Harry Grey? [Fisher:] How do you picture a man who's killing little girls and cutting them up with broken bottles? Twenty five, twenty six But it doesn't help. Thirty three, thirty four thirty five, thirty six thirty seven, thirty eight thirty nine, forty - [bell chiming] - forty one, forty two forty three - I don't understand it. - What? What was Harry Grey doing in Dritten Marsk? I don't care. One murder per month. That means we're missing one. Come on. We're going for a drive. [car passing] [therapist:] It sounds like you're on to something. En route, Mr. Fisher, en route. [Fisher:] En route, you bastard. [knocking] Is the library open? Do you realize what time it is? I want to see all the newspapers from the last two months. Books and bother Killed my mother. Books and bother Killed my mother. And my father too. [Fisher:] There's no mention in the papers of a lotto murder in Dritten Marsk. But what if the body had never been found? Well, I've just found a grave foot and mouth. It looks like I'll need Kramer's men after all. [Fisher:] Damn it, H.G. Damn it. [Kramer on radio:] Damn it, Fisher. Damn it. OK. We're going in. [Kramer on radio:] What the hell's going on here? [man:] Let go. [Kramer on radio:] Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Who's in charge of this operation? Ah you feel good now, Fisher. You don't give a fuck for anything I say. I hope you choke yourself in this shit. Who's in charge of this operation? [gagging] This is Kramer. I'm taking over. I want this hole emptied and sifted every last bit. [Kramer on megaphone:] You're trying to get one up, Fisher. I've read my Osborne too. Did you know that? But I'm the one who knows what's what. The girls on the square were naughty and fair. Mostly Marie, mostly Marie. So you got yourself a China doll, Fisher? You fuck them in the ass. [helicopters hovering, chattering continues] Harry Grey would never hide a body. [Fisher:] The dead lotto girl was there, all right. But Harry Grey doesn't kill to hide a body. The murder is for the sake of a pattern. Someone else must have hidden her. Do you believe in good and bad? Can you make the bad good again? [therapist:] Do you believe in good and bad? Come, come, Mr. Fisher. Did she really say that? We're closing in on Harry. I can feel it. I want you to screw God into me. I'm Kim and you're Harry. Your wife is in Cairo with a little blue star on her breast. I'll get God in there as fast as I can. [Kim:] Shh [helicopter approaching] [Kim:] But He'll only stay until I get up. [Fisher:] I don't care about Kramer anymore. I'm proving that Osborne's method still works. It feels good. Do you have to leave? Harry hunts alone tonight. What's the matter? I got scared. I'm all right now. [Fisher:] Harry is going places. [therapist:] You're drifting. [Fisher:] If I'm drifting, so was Harry Grey at this point. I'm only doing what the tailing report tells me to. [therapist:] It doesn't seem connected to the story, Mr. Fisher. He's out there somewhere. He'll show up. First part: the body, second part: the soul. [therapist:] You're drifting, Mr. Fisher. Take care. [Fisher:] I'm so close to him. He's right here somewhere. [leaves rustle, wings flapping] [Fisher whispering:] Harry me, marry me, bury me bind me. [wood snaps] [wood snaps] OK, H.G. [therapist:] What are you doing, Mr. Fisher? [Fisher:] I honestly don't know anymore. [therapist:] But you are overlooking that someone made the third cross. [Fisher:] That's right. The third cross I do not see. [Fisher:] Kim? Kim? [coughs, gasps] What sort of a house is this? [Kim:] Can't you see, somebody wants to scare you? What happened? Somebody was standing behind the door when I came in. I didn't see him. This is not a game. You'll get killed. I found how to close the system. You are not Harry Grey. You're Fisher. [man muttering] And the monarch thwarts dominion. It stood there. Never seraph spread opinion Over fabric half so fair. This is Halle. If we take the harbor in Innenstadt as the center take the first four murders and duplicate them, we get two points: Dritten Marsk Halle. We don't just have a geometrical figure but a letter. If the system is going to be closed like this he will commit his seventh and last murder in Halle in ten to fifteen days. Does that mean we can stop, now you've found what you wanted? But the motive? The mind? Mad men don't have motives. I need to know everything. It's my work. It's not your work. Why can't you leave him to Kramer? Kramer and his men will get him in Halle. That's the difference between Kramer and me. I cannot stop until I understand. I owe it to Osborne. You understand less and less. I must do it according to the book. I can't stop now. You leave me behind, Harry. [therapist:] I'm afraid you leave me behind too, Harry. [quiet groaning] [Kim:] I must go. Shh Kim? [groaning continues] Try a little salycin. It's no good. Who were you talking to? - What do you mean? - Nobody. [panting] The string, the string. Tighter. Tighter, tighter. [thunder rumbling] [groaning continues] Why do you keep torturing yourself? I have to. I believe in joy. [groaning intensifies] [screaming] I believe in joy. [therapist:] It's not your headache, Mr. Fisher. Days go on and on with no change. Hey, Schmuck of Ages, the sabbath's over. My name's Harry Grey. Have I been here before? - No. - Check the book. Check the book. - You were here two months ago. - Not me. - Harry Grey. - Three years ago. Hello? Fraulein? [man muttering] You had Double Room 5. I'll take that again. - But we don't want any mess this time. - What are you talking about? Maybe I should say it to the missus. You know, this might not be the Savoy, but we do try to keep the rooms clean. OK? [traffic noise] I want to show you something. Later. Harry came to Halberstadt and stayed with Kim die halbe Nacht. [whistling] If you could only see yourself. I didn't know you would take it like that. Look what I got made. This is not the first time you've stayed in this hotel, is it? What do you mean? What did Harry Grey feel about the blood when you screwed? I don't know what you're talking about. [groans] Whore! [gasps, panting] You're sick. Oh no. No, oh. [screaming] Is that your friend out there? Relax, for Christ's sake. Relax. You're trying to drive me mad, scare me. It's a plot. - What is it you want to know? - Everything. Did you talk about the lotto murders when you fucked? Was he religious? Did he take sugar in his coffee? I have a child with Harry Grey. [horn honking] [Fisher:] The blood made me think. It's something I should have realized long ago. By following the same route as H.G., I ran into the same girl. Kim had been with Harry Grey. I'm getting rid of the pills getting rid of Harry Grey for good. It's not my headache. I've made up my mind. I can't stay. My Cairo jacket is too thin for this climate. It seems, Europe will never let me rest. I'm too tired right now even to wonder what happened. Discipline is a prerequisite. Discipline is a prerequisite. I would describe the development as a growing hunger an insatiable appetite for the hunted. The criminologist can afford no weakness. He must remain untouched, detached, clinical, objective. To do otherwise would be to misuse my method. [therapist:] So that's all, Mr. Fisher? That's your story? Yes, that's all. [bell rings] [Fisher reading] Dear Mr. Fisher We're contacting you on the recommendation of Mr. Osborne. Our granddaughter sells lotto. Mr. Osborne was afraid she might be contacted by a certain Mr. Grey here in Halle. [man:] Got you, sheriff. [therapist:] So Cairo will have to wait. [man:] He wanted to meet her alone tonight. Of course we told the police straight away. We want to help. We had a lot of respect for Inspector Osborne. Nothing can happen. All the police will be there. [therapist:] What's the plan? [Fisher:] Harry Grey is meeting the lotto girl tonight. I'll be there. Now I've got him. [thunder rumbling] [girl:] Where are the other policemen? We can manage. The other police will make a mess of things. Have you heard of Kramer? Kramer must not come. [glass clattering] I've got something to show you. [thunder continues] Push me. [Fisher:] We don't have very much time. Yes, we do. [thunder continues] Is he here now? I'm scared. [doll squeaks] [thunder continues] Are you ill? [glass shatters] [crying] [doll squeaks] [crying continues] [girl screaming] [screaming] [gasping] Stop it! Can't anyboy make them stop. I don't give a fuck for the dive. Fuckers! shit! Fuckers! Shit! Shut up! This is Kramer. Don't Jump! Well, if it isn't Fisher! How are your theories doing, Fish? I have something which might interest you. Did you get my note about Osborne? Messages can go around that tube mail system for weeks. He wrote to me, a confession: the murder in the harbor and one more here in Halle. Do you know anything about that, Fish? So I think I solved your little mystery for you. Got a bit over-involved you could say. You know how these things can happen, Fish, do you? It's anarchy in these parts, not freedom. Anarchy. It confuses people. They succumb, go under. The Osbornes. He couldn't quite cope with the element of crime. He loved system, did Osborne. When Harry Grey died, Osborne brought his system to completion. It took him over. You believed his act. I want to wake up now. Are you there? You can wake me up now. Are you there?
