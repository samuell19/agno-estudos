(deep dark music) - [Man] Coming up on Nellis. You ready to land that new baby? - [Man] Roger, leader. (deep tense music) - [Man] (mumbles) for descent. - [Man] Roger, I am right behind you. (exploding) (deep intense music) - Thank you, Dr. Henry. Thank you. - Good work out there. Great job. - Gentlemen, we have a winner. (deep intense music) Fly high circuitry could be adapted into any late model aircraft. But at least double the (mumbles) capability. - Then why did we build a whole damn new airplane? (deep intense music) - That plane, plus the new circuitry, is the cutting edge of military technology. We sell the circuitry, we keep the plane. (deep intense music) It remains an exclusive American weapon. - It better. Considering what it's supposed to be capable of. - Governor, I think you'll be very impressed with the demonstration. - How many countries will be attending this demonstration? - 27. (deep intense music) - Did you stick with the price we discussed last week? - We bumped it, half a billion per country to pick up fly high. - Half a billion? - Hell of a lot cheaper than (mumbles) fighter jets. - Absolutely. (deep intense music) - Has the press blackout been maintained? - Only the White House knows that the chip and the plane are even here. (deep intense music) - Any security concerns? - Come on, Governor, who's going to break into an Air Force base? - I guess you're right, you'd have to be a real nutcase even to think of doing something like that. - Building F3 is accessible for both sides of (mumbles). The target's housed in a negative vacuum room. How's security once you're inside? - (mumbles) employment of the guards is eight. - There are just two regulars on the day. - One here, one there. (deep intense music) - You sure there's only two? (phone ringing) (mumbles) - Two minutes. (deep intense music) (guns firing) - Two here, two there. - Fine, I'll debrief him. (intense rhythmic music) The base entry plan through the RC7 gate. Rogers and Mike will be manning that position from 0700 to 1700 hours. - Two minutes in, all power down, right? - That's correct. - I don't think it's enough time to get the chip. (deep intense music) - Any longer down and the target will be automatically vaulted, making it inaccessible to anybody but the President of the United States. Do you have a problem with that? (deep rhythmic music) - Yes, because after two minutes, all defenses go back up and running. We'll be taking a lot of heat. (gun firing) - Anyone else have any problems? (gun firing) (intense rhythmic music) At 0500 hours, all personnel in arms will move out through (mumbles). Mr. Baffle will lead the convoy in on the eastern service road, E4. (intense deep music) (soft lighthearted music) (light talking) - Okay, you go. Woobang! (mumbles) (laughing) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, go ahead. Whoa, hey! (laughing) Watch this, we're gonna have a little fun now. Oh, what is this (mumbles), clumsy little. (laughing) We are gonna eat it now like a dog, huh. Woof, woof, woof, that's it. How does that taste, huh? What's this, tears, huh? You crying for mommy. What are we get you now, huh, come on. He's a feisty little kitten. (groaning) He bit me! - Leave the boy alone! (grunting) Hold it right there, boys, you boys don't wanna be doing this. I'm a deputy sheriff, it's time for you boys to leave. Come on, let's go! You all right? - Good job, Harper. - Hey, Webb. - Hey, Harper. Hey, you wouldn't happen to know if Captain's home, would you? - No, I don't know where she is. Don't worry, Lou, I've seen your food in worst places. (deep rhythmic music) - [Man] Beta group will come in near the entrance of the elevators and commence occupation of same. After primary securitization, the eagle will nest. (intense rhythmic music) (phone ringing) (beeping) - [Woman] Hi, this is Katherine, I'm not home right now so please leave a message at the tone. (beeping) - Bye, Lou. (grunting) (deep dark music) - Hey, Geronimo! (grunting) (tense rhythmic music) Back up! (grunting) (tense rhythmic music) - I didn't get any word about military maneuvers. Can I help you? - [Man] Mr. Bartel. (gun firing) - Take it down! Mark, just take care of the fall and pluck all communication. - Sorry I took so long, Lou, I got caught up over at Blood Canyon. Well, Harper, I see you're having a friendly cup of coffee. Sir, would you like to file a formal complaint for excessive force? He said no, everybody hear? Harper, you need medical? - No, I'm fine. - Well, you can help me tie these boys up. - I'm off duty, remember. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - What's up, Webb? - Harper's idea of off duty. (deep rhythmic music) - [Man] Move it! Come on! Down there. (guns firing) There he is! (guns firing) Come on. I need three men over there. - [Harper] What's all this? - I'm moving as soon as I finish packing. - Just like that, without even talking about it. - Would it have done any good? You know I don't like living in the desert. - It's not gonna be forever. - I can't wait any longer, Jacob. I'm pregnant. (soft serene music) - Well, then for sure you can't go. - No, I'm not raising a child here. - We're still married, Katherine. - We're separated and you can't tell me what to do. - You're not gonna take my child away. - Well you know, there's a really simple solution. Come with me. - I can't. - Even your father thinks you should. - You told my father before coming to tell me? - Well, I wanted some support! - You can't leave. - No, you won't leave. (deep rhythmic music) - Move! (intense rhythmic music) (gun firing) - Watch it! - One of the security guards is still missing. He hasn't checked in for his shift yet. Give him another 15 minutes, then we'll close off the mine and the roadway. We're still on schedule, Mr. Bartel. What about the hill? - We mined the most likely entrance roots that a rapid response team would take. We're ready. (deep slow music) - [Katherine] Jacob, I'm pregnant. I'm not raising a child here. - [Harper] We're still married Katherine. - [Katherine] We're separated and you can't tell me what to do. - [Harper] You're not gonna take my child. - You know what, there's a real simple solution. Come with me. - [Harper] I can't. (deep slow music) - I thought I'd find you here. - Aren't you gonna be late for work? - After 22 years, I can afford to be late to work once in a while. All that water's still gonna be there. What are you gonna do about Katherine? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Son, don't throw away the best chance you'll ever have for a good life. I like the dessert, your mother and I had a good life here. I like being near her people. - They're my people too. - I know, I know. And your mother always loved that you were proud of your Indian heritage. But you have responsibilities now. You gotta think about your responsibilities. - Grandfather Eagle Claw told me he had a vision that I'd have a special moment here in the dessert. I believe him and I can't go, not yet. - Even if it means losing Katherine? Now don't be stupid, Jacob, she's as special as your mother was! - It's my life, dad. - Yeah, but it's my grandchild! - Gentlemen, stand up, please. Let's be clear with each other. I will ask things on you and you will carry them out without question or comment. If you don't. (gun firing) So, I assume we're clear. Good, very good indeed. (tense rhythmic music) (beeping) - [Woman] Agent Collins, sir, I think you should take this call. - Collins. - Oh, Agent Collins, yes. Well, the thing is my friend and I sort of taken over the dams (mumbles). As a matter of fact, I'm calling you from the control room right now. - If this is some kind of prank. - Well, our demands is simple. Put 25 million dollars in cash and a sexy picture of Madonna, I'm a big fan, you know. Put the money in a briefcase. I'll give you explicit instructions in our next phone call. Oh and by the way, if you fail to comply exactly as instructed, I'll blow the dam, flood the entire area, probably causing a lot of death and destruction. Goodbye. - You sure the call came from the dam? - [Man] That's confirmed, sir. - Get a chopper, we're on the way. - [Woman] Sheriff, here's the tape with their demands. - Hello there, my name is Harrison Dekker and I've taken over the Cooper Dam with a few of my colleagues. By now we've probably killed a few people but we're still holding more hostages. My demands are simple, put 25 million dollars in a bag and bring it to me within the next four hours or I'll blow the dam and we all know what sort of trouble that would cause, don't we? To say nothing of the replacement costs. I'm sure you'll do the right thing. Thank you for your kind attention. (deep tense music) - What the hell's going on? - You must be Mr. Harper. - Can I kill this? - No, let him live, we need the hostages. - [Woman] Sir, can you give us any information on the situation? - [Woman] Excuse me, sir! - I'm sorry but at this time we can provide with no further information. To do so would be to jeopardize the lives of the hostages. Yes, this is a hostage taking situation. Many of you here are familiar with protocol, we are going to do this one by the book. We'll keep you informed of any further developments as they become available to us. (group yelling) Thank you, ladies. - Come on in. Close the door. Boy, what a mess. - Why didn't you call me? - I'm sorry, Harper, there's no time. Things are going crazy around here. - My father's in that dam. - I know, I know. They're taking hostages, your father could be one of them. Negotiations are on their way. The FBI has things under control. - What are we gonna do? - We're gonna do exactly what the FBI tells us to do. We've got enough on our hands taking care of the civilians around here. - Who's in charge? - The guy over there on the phone, Agent Collins. He came in town and took over the whole operation. He made it perfectly clear, stay the hell out of the way, which is just fine by me. - None of this really makes any sense at all. Dekker (mumbles), Bartel's a mercenary. Neither one of them are terrorists, so. Just a minute, Johnson, I want you to send in a rapid response unit to West Hills right now, you got it? Have them choppered in out of (mumbles), then they can hike and setup their positions. You got that? - Yes, sir. - So we have to concentrate on civilians, Harper, they've got it under control. And Harp, we don't need any heroic. - Cecil, Cecil? Cecil, where the hell were you? Then do it in your pants, damn it! I can't have you going anywhere while I'm trying to set up control right now. Do you understand, I cannot have you go-- - Deputy Harper. - Not right now, excuse me. Cecil, those men (mumbles) that dam for anything. The time is too much-- - Excuse me. - Excuse me! No, no, I don't care, Cecil! I do not-- - Excuse me! - Look, if you interrupt me one more time, I am going to have you removed, you understand me? Now listen, I'm not going to tell you again, Cecil. I can handle this, I'm gonna have the Quantico team sticking their (beep) in. (grunting) - Now, can we talk? - Hey, hey, he's a law enforcement officer! His dad could be in the dam. - Well, I'm real sorry about that but if you don't get him the hell out of here right now, I am going to have him arrested for interfering with a federal investigation. Get him the hell out of here! - Yes, sir. Come on, Harp, let's go, let's go! (people yelling) - Rick, here's an update. It's been reported that one of the hostages may be the father of Deputy Sheriff Harper. The Senior Harper is a longtime employee of the dam. He was scheduled to work at the dam today. He has not been able to be located and has not been heard from. Mr. Harper's well known and highly regarded for the charity work he does in the area. His son, the Deputy Sheriff, was not available for comment but undoubtedly, this personal aspect of the tragedy must be a tremendous burden. (slow solemn music) (mumbles) - Move it on to (mumbles), let's go, move guys, move. Move, damn it! Johnson, Johnson, answer me when I talk to you! - What's the problem, Mr. Bartel? - You know I don't like running things from down here. It's just not my style. - If we control the elevators and the stairways, we control access to the dam. - Can you let me kill a few hostages just so nobody gets heroic (mumbles)? - I admire your style, Mr. Bartel, I like your work. - Is that a yes or a no? - [Harrison] No. (knocking) - Hey, I was just trying to call you. Is your father okay? - That's what I'm gonna find out. - [Katherine] Please, what the hell's going on? - There's an old construction tunnel at the front of the dam. I used to play in it when I was a kid. I bet they don't know about it. - [Katherine] God, are you crazy? - Do you really think the FBI is gonna turn over 25 million dollars to these guys? If I don't do something, my father's as good as dead. - Jacob, if you go in there, you are as good as dead. (deep tense music) - My father's in there. - Jacob, what about the baby? I mean, what if something happens to you? Come on, Jacob, don't do this. - I have to. (deep tense music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hey Kate, it's Snookie, how you doing? - I'm okay. - I'm looking for Harper. He had a big blow up with those FBI guys that just came in and I wanted to make sure he's okay. I don't want him doing something crazy. - Like what? - Like, I don't know. - I haven't seen him, Snookie. - You know, I know he's worried about his dad being one of the hostages over at the dam. But the FBI boys, they have a pretty good plan. So if you hear from him, have him call me, okay? - Yeah, okay. - Katherine, if you need to call, don't hesitate, okay. - Okay. (deep rhythmic music) - [Reporter] Hostages have been taken at the Cooper Dam. (deep tense music) - Well, I wonder what happens when you do this. (alarms ringing) - What the hell's going on? - Just checking our information. Is everything else clear? - Got 1,000 cops with 1,000 guns sitting on top of us, quiet yes. - What about the press? - There's a couple of choppers up there. - We'll give them something to chew on about an hour. In the meantime, let's open the floodgates, make certain we have plenty of water flowing downstream. Collins and his crew are gonna be one surprised group of idiots. - You think they have any idea what we're doing? - Not a clue, not a bloody clue. (laughing) (deep dark music) (phone ringing) - [Woman] Sheriff's station. - Sheriff, please. - [Woman] I'm sorry, the Sheriff's unavailable. - Tell him it's Webb and you better do it right now, you got it! - [Woman] I'll see what I can do, Webb. - What's up, Webb? - You heard from our friend? - No, you? - No, but he's gotta get ahold of me, I got what he needs, remember? - Let me give you some advice, once you go playing games, you're just gonna get yourself hurt. - Don't worry about me. - I am worried about you, Webb. - I can take care of myself! - Sure. You seen Harper? - Not since the bar. - You know where he is? - Do you think he knows something? - I'm sure he knows something, he knows about the dam situation. Look, I'll talk to you later, Webb. (slow tense music) Harris! Harris, get in here! (soft tense music) (beeping) (phone ringing) - Collins. - Collins, you're running out of time. I'm going to start killing people, one every two hours. - Every hostage you kill weakens your position by one less person. - Every hostage I kill jerks your scrotum around your neck. Let's see how many have to die before I get what I want. (deep tense music) - I was gonna help you load up but you ain't even further along. - I don't know if I'm coming or going. - What's wrong? - Jacob, he's gonna try to get inside the dam. - No way, he can't do it, it's locked up tighter than a drum. - He said something about these tunnels. - I know where he's going, I'll stop him. - We're not gonna be able to stop him. He's going after his father. - There's no helping his dad. Harper's gotta save himself. Besides, he's got responsibilities now, sis. Whatever you do, don't call Snookie! (deep tense music) - There seems to be some kind of activity happening at the dam, right there. - Let's see, we've got two news helicopter and three police helicopters. Pick one, Mr. Bartel. - Eenie, meenie, miney, moe. (missile firing) (exploding) (deep rhythmic music) - Tighten down security. They'll probably try something stupid now. (deep rhythmic music) (helicopter whirring) - Your request for 25 million dollars is absurd. - Oh, but Mr. Bartel's had to put all this assault equipment on his credit card. Afraid someone's going to have to reimburse him. - I don't hold the purse strings around here, Dekker. - I'll kill a hostage every two hours until our demands are met. - Killing any hostages would be a major mistake. - Two hours. (slow tense music) (deep dark music) - That's a dream catcher. (metal clanking) - Thomas, you hear that? (deep rhythmic music) Bartel, Bartel, this is Scorelli. I think we have an intruder. - That's impossible. Probably one of the security guards playing cowboy. - All the security guards are accounted for. - Whoever it is, find him and kill him. Report back to Mr. Bartel. - Yeah, bring me his head. (deep tense music) - [Man] (mumbles) watch your toes on the trip line. - Thank you for that fascinating information. Hutch. (deep tense music) (guns firing) (exploding) - Scorelli? Scorelli? Anybody seen or heard from Scorelli in the last 10 minutes? Grimwald, you grab Tiny, you go check it out. And you hurry about it. (deep intense music) - [Reporter] Reports coming in from the FBI say that hostages have been taken at the Cooper Dam. Latest reports also confirm that the terrorists have fired on police helicopter. We have yet to confirm the identity of the terrorists. (deep intense music) (coughing) - Collins, this is Dekker. I've been too lenient on you. You've been screwing me around on the 25 million, Collins. Nobody screws me around, least of all, some stupid career cop making 50,000 a year. I've got 12 hostages left. In exactly 15 minutes from now, I'm going to take half the hostages, there will be six in case you're having trouble counting, to the top of the dam. I'm going to chain them together and push them off. There are still six lives you can save if you act quickly. All it takes is 25 million. (deep tense music) (gasping) (groaning) (fast rhythmic music) - All right, everybody, listen up. As soon as we've got our rapid response unit into place in the hills over in the Nevada set, I wanna try a strike at the top of the dam. Comments? - I got a comment. What do you think you're gonna accomplish besides getting people killed? - Sheriff, taking ground a little at a time is classic battle strategy. - Classic stupid if you ask me. What if they blow off the top of that dam while you're trying to take it, then what? - Sheriff, why don't you please just concentrate on your, your job. - I've had 46 disturbance calls in the last two hours and they're coming back to back, boom, boom, boom. - Well then why don't you just continue to do your boom boom and keep the peace and I'll do my boom boom with my men. Thank you, Sheriff. (deep dark music) - I own you, Collins, I know every move you make before you even think of it. - [Man] Mr. Dekker, sir, this is Ace. I think we have a problem. - Damn. - [Ace] Mr. Bartel, sir, have you seen Tiny and Grimwald? - I've got everyone looking. - I'll send Dick down there and kill anything that moves. - Be right back. - Back to work. (deep tense music) - Mr. Dekker, do you want me to blow another chopper in the sky? - You know what's a shame, Mr. Bartel? The world will never know the true brilliance of this operation but with the money our friends are paying us for their little piece of hardware, more than compensate for any lack of recognition, don't you think? - You got that right. (fast exciting music) - [Man] Move it. Come on, let's go! Come on, come on, let's go man, move it. Hustle, hustle. (fast intense music) - Mr. Bartel, I think it's about time we let these gentlemen know we're not kidding around. Why don't you go out top and pull out the heavy artillery. - Roger that. - Dawson, take this man up top. - Wait, wait, whatever you need him for, take me. - Nobody tells me what to do. (deep intense music) Still want to volunteer? - Collins, this is Wench. Second team has taken position on the east cliff. - [Man] Let's go. (fast rhythmic music) Move it out, move it out, let's go! Hustle, hustle. Go, go, go, go, go! (deep intense music) - Dekker, we're in position. - [Mr. Dekker] I'll let Mr. Collins know that we're ready to toss a hostage off the dam. That should get his attention. - Would you like him to go over head first or feet first? - [Mr. Dekker] That would be your choice, Mr. Bartel. - My pleasure. (fast rhythmic music) Blow it in 30 seconds. - Oh god, no, no, man, please don't. Please don't, oh god. - Collins, they're going to throw a hostage off the dam. (deep tense music) - It's over. Take out your gun, set it down slowly. Now stand up. Walk straight ahead, nice and slow. Mr. Dekker, it's Larson, I have the intruder. (grunting) (fast tense music) (sobbing) - What the hell do you think you're doing? - I did warn you. - That's killing a man in cold blood, Dekker. - It's been almost two hours. Did you hear me? - I'm sending you authorization for the rules of engagement, Commander. You have permission to use full force. Take them out now. (deep tense music) - Roger that. Sniper, stand by for my count. - On my mark, Mr. Bartel. Three, two, one, mark. (exploding) (fast tense music) - Let's see what you got. (grunting) - Let me show you how to really bend somebody over! (exploding) (yelling) That's better than sex. (gun firing) (grunting) (deep tense music) Move, move! Move, move, move, go, damn it! (gun firing) (grunting) (soft tense music) - Now, let's talk about the hostages. (slow deep music) Are you all right? - Yeah, what the hell are you doing here? - What do you think? - My son will get us out of here. He used to do all this covert stuff when he was in the Army. - Dad, please. - Well, can you deactivate it? - I don't think so. And if I try to force the cuffs off, it could set off the bomb. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. - You came in here without a plan? - Well, what plan was I supposed to have? - How the hell should I know, I'm not the one who came busting in here. - Shh, just let me think. - Jacob, there's no time to think. - I need to get a key. - Be careful! - Your son's gonna get us all killed. - Oh sure, Ted, like you had any chance of coming out of this alive anyway. - So Collins, are you now convinced of my sincerity? - [Mr. Collins] Stop firing at my men, Dekker. I have wounded to get out. - If I do, will you stop playing these silly games from the FBI manual in hostage negotiation? - [Mr. Collins] I told you before, I don't control-- - All right, more games. Collins, make sure that you're watching the local television station. I'm about to up the ante. Larson, Larson, what the hell took so long? (deep tense music) - [Jacob] Do exactly as I say. - [Mr. Dekker] If you're smart, you'll put the gun down and I'll let you live. - This way. - What is your problem, chief? Did we violate sacred burial ground or something? - I want the key to the hostages. - My only problem is I don't have it. - All right, let's get it on. - This isn't going to do you any good. My men are everywhere. Besides, I've told you, I don't have the key. - Then you better find it! - How's it going, Harper? - Webb, good to see you again! - What are you doing here? - I want the rest of my money so you can't hurt him yet. - Well done, good fellow, you've got a gun. Shoot him. - Put the gun down, Harper, or I'm gonna have to kill you. - Are you crazy, Webb? - Put the gun down! - What are you doing, Webb? - You think I won't! Put the gun down! I will, put it down! - Don't listen to this moron-- - Shut up! - [Mr. Dekker] Shoot him. - [Webb] I deserve better than this! - [Mr. Dekker] Don't listen to him. - I'm not dumb, Harper, I'm dyslexic, there's a difference, you know! - [Mr. Dekker] Kill him, pull the trigger! - Passing up the money they're giving me would be stupid, they're paying me a fortune! - What makes you think they let you keep the money? - [Webb] I gave them everything they want! - Shut up! - [Webb] No, you shut up! - That's enough! - I'm not stupid, Harper, I left out one thing. They need me, please put it down! (deep tense music) (gun firing) (screaming) (groaning) - You find him or (mumbles)! (screaming) (grunting) - There he is, get him! - He followed you in here, didn't he? - No, I forgot he knew about tunnels! He came before I did! - What's he doing here? - I don't know, he's a cop, he's just playing hero! - You moron, you almost got us killed! - Stop it, stop it! Nobody else knows about the tunnels, I swear! - Is the top of the damn clear? - [Man] Yes, sir. - Take this dyslexic idiot and make sure that the route he took in here is closed off! (beeping) (deep dark music) (exploding) - I can't believe it. - What'd I tell you? - They actually blew it. - No sign of him yet. - Don't worry, we'll find him. (deep scary music) - Sending someone in here was a pretty stupid idea. - He's not our man. - [Mr. Dekker] Then who the hell is he? - Well, he's on his own. - I'm going to send him back to you in small pieces. - Have the highway patrol get over there pronto! Anyone find Harper yet? - [Man] Still no sign of him yet. This guy could be anywhere, he's unpredictable, you know how he is. (deep tense music) - Everyone work your way down. He's gotta be on that side. Listen, you take care of this geek. - Renowsky! Go pick up Kate Harper and bring her in right now. Go, do it! (deep tense music) I need more help now, we're gonna have riots. - That is absolute (beep). - Half the population in this county believe that areas live in Area 51, the other half believe it's a government conspiracy every time they hear a sonic boom from that experimental aircraft they test up here. So this ain't the most stable environment to drop a load of terrorists in who wanna blow up the second largest dam in the world. I need more help and I need it now! - Where exactly am I supposed to get this help, Sheriff? I've got every cop in the area mobilized plus the National Guard-- - I don't care where you get the help from! - You don't get anything, I don't have the resources! Dekker wasn't supposed to blow up the god (beep) place. - I guess Dekker didn't know that. Excuse me, I got a riot to attend. The highway patrol has an emergency agreement with Nellis Air Base. - So what? - So they'll order troops if you ask them. - All right, I'll do it. I'll do it! (deep dark music) (grunting) - You wanna tell me where Jacob is, Katherine? He could be in trouble. (deep tense music) (sobbing) (whispering) - General, I don't care what you got going on back at the base, this is a national emergency and it takes precedent over everything else. Now you comply with the patrol request or this becomes a presidential concern, you got it? General, I want them now. (deep tense music) - All right, the second team is in position. I'm gonna wanna shut down part of the entire southern grid. (deep dark music) - You're (mumbles) aren't all that quiet now, are you? - [Jacob] Looks like I got you as much as you got me. - Really? How about it, why don't you just go ahead? Pull the trigger. Let's just see who dies first. - It's time for the power down and don't tell me you can't. All units prepare for a power down. (guns firing) (grunting) (deep tense music) This is the eagle, zigma to proceed as scheduled. Count down to power off, proceed to entry. Gentlemen, the target is ready and waiting. (grunting) (deep tense music) (yelling) - Here they come. - So what are you gonna do with your half of the money? - Change my name, change my face. Buy me a rich man's place in the country that ain't got no extradition treaty with the good old US of A. - 1400, power down time. Let's wave these bad boys through. (deep rhythmic music) You think they'll pull it off? - Hey man, these guys are the best I've ever seen. (deep tense music) (grunting) (glass shattering) - You got a light? - Where's Johnson? - He got sent over to that dam. They called me up from reserve, I'm Ozgold. - Cameron. - Nice to meet you. - There's no one left here, Evans got sent over to the hostage thing. - You from around here? - Local. - You got a family? - A couple beautiful kids. - That's excellent, I'm trying to start a family myself. Let's move. (deep rhythmic music) (screaming) - [Jacob] Now, where's the key to the hostages? - Looks like they pulled it off. - They're rich men. (slow tense music) - It's gonna take hours for the grid to reestablish electricity in this area unless Dekker sets the juice loose, and he ain't about to do that. I'm telling you, Collins, you gotta get those troops over here from Nellis now. - They've all ready been requested. Now what about this two bit deputy of yours, Sheriff? - His name is Jacob Harper. - All right, what are the chances of Jacob Harper pulling this thing off? - Harper's a good cop, was in special forces for six years, knows this landscape like the back of his hand. If anyone can do it, it's Harper. (grunting) (deep scary music) - I just stole the password to (mumbles), I didn't think anyone was going to get hurt. - Well, you didn't think hard enough. - I was thinking of the money. - Money makes people do stupid things, Webb. Giving them the password, that would be stupid. Now, where's the key to the hostages? - Go ahead and pull the trigger. - Dekker's got it. - You have exactly one more chance to do the right thing, Collins. - I don't have 25 million dollars, no how, no way. - Well, how's this for real, imagine what it costs to rebuild this dam. - Oh, you're not gonna destroy that dam, Dekker. You see, my sources are telling me you don't have enough explosives to destroy that dam. - Yes, well perhaps I don't need explosives to destroy this place. - Meaning? - Oh, you're a bright boy, Collins, figure it out. (slow tense music) - Son of a bitch said he could blow the dam without explosives. Yeah, okay. Anyway to blow the dam without explosives? - Well, possibly, there is a way to overload the generators. - Why didn't anybody tell me about this, huh? Why didn't you tell me about this? - Bartel? Bartel? (deep tense music) - Put your weapon down. Here's the deal, let the hostages go and I'll give you back this scum. - Bartel's a soldier, he knows the risks. - Webb isn't and he seems to have something you need. - The value of what he has is directly proportionate to a lot of factors, some of which aren't clear yet. - You don't have the time to figure it out. - You know, Tonto, most people truly don't have the stones to cold bloodedly kill anybody. Not unless there's a great deal at stake. What's at stake for you? Because if it doesn't add up to 25 million dollars, I'm willing to call your bluff. (tense rhythmic music) Well, what the hell. Since it doesn't really matter anyway. Hold your fire, men. Let them pass, let them pass. There will be no firing. - If anybody fires, they both go down. - You amuse me, Mr. Harper. You don't really think you're going to just walk out of here, do you? - Come on! (gun firing) - Harper, Harper, don't leave me, please! - We gotta help him! - Harper! - Forget him, there's nothing we can do for him. Let's get these other guys out of here. (mumbles) - Harper, Harper, don't leave me. Please, Harper! - [Man] Sir, permission is complete. - Gentlemen, zigma has secured the target. I repeat, zigma has returned the target. The dance is over, Mr. Bartel, let's move. (grunting) Disappointed in you, Webb. You really should have warned me. (grunting) I thought we were closer than that. I thought we were friends. I ran a check on your Mr. Harper and it turns out that one of the hostages is his father! (coughing) Perhaps there's something else you'd like to tell me, like perhaps the password? - Screw you. - That doesn't sound like the password. (grunting) (soft tense music) Come on, Webb, we had a deal. You want the money, don't you, hmm? Come on, tell me the password. (mumbles) Thank you. Good boy. (soft tense music) Well done, Webb. I knew I could count on you in the end. (sobbing) - Okay, okay. (grunting) (slow dark music) - The money will be dropped in 10 minutes at the top of the dam as instructed. - Oh, I'm so glad that you finally saw reason, Mr. Collins. - Just a warning, Dekker, you mess with that damn again, I won't rest until I find you. - How single minded of you. Aren't you worried about the hostages? - You hurt anybody else and I'll hurt you. - Break out the wet gear, I'll deal with the computer system. (alarms ringing) (beeping) (deep dark music) - Come on, let's move, move, move, come on, move it! Come on! Keep your head down! Come on, son, go! - What's happening? - They're overloading the generators. The whole dam's gonna blow. - I've gotta go back. - You'll get yourself killed. - I love you, dad. (slow tense music) (alarms ringing) - Go, move! Let's go! Keep moving! Mr. Dekker, the last of the men are headed down the stairway. You better come on, we're going for a swim. - Johnson, lock and load the tracer and close the dam lid. Carter, inform rapid response unit of our movements. When Mr. Dekker puts his hands in this, we're gonna blow him straight to hell. Green, Sheriff Green? Hey, we're gonna need a police escort to the chopper. Let's go. - Must be Friday, Mr. Bartel, time for your bath. (laughing) (alarm ringing) (deep dark music) - [Operator] Activation sequence in progress. (beeping) (alarms ringing) - [Operator] Please enter password. - Password? (alarm ringing) - [Operator] Password incorrect. Access denied, access denied. Please enter password. (gasping) Please enter password. - Webb, Webb, I need the password. (grunting) (deep rhythmic music) - [Operator] Activation in one minute. (beeping) (deep tense music) Please enter password. Please enter password. - Rats. (beeping) (alarms ringing) - [Operator] Password incorrect, access denied. Access denied. Please enter password. (alarms ringing) (deep tense music) - Star. (beeping) - [Operator] Access granted. Activation sequence terminated. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Mr. Collins] FBI, Collins, who the hell are you? - Jacob Harper. - [Mr. Collins] What the hell's going on there, Harper? - It's over. (slow solemn music) Thanks, Webb. - No, it just doesn't make any sense. Why go through all this and not even try to go for the money? - My opinion, the way I see it, Harper took care of business. He did what should've done, he chased them out of here. - [Mr. Collins] I don't know, something still doesn't smell right to me. - What a loser. Harper, your dad's all right. Katherine, I'm sorry about Webb. (slow deep music) Hey, let's blow this pop stand. Come on, let's get out of here. Its all right, buddy, you did good. (deep dark music) - [Mr. Collins] (mumbles), Bartel's a mercenary, neither one of them are terrorists. - Tired? - Thinking. You know, as much as I hate to admit it, Collins is right. This doesn't make any sense. I didn't chase them out anywhere. - So they saw the game was up, they got out while the getting was good. - I almost feel like they didn't want the money. Maybe they were after something else. - Something else, huh? Take it easy, it ain't that deep, relax. Give it up. - Where'd those soldiers come from? - Nellis, we brought them in to help out with ground control. - You know, I remember where I saw one of Dekker's men. He did security when I was stationed at Nellis. This whole thing has something to do with Nellis. I'm gonna call Collins. - Hold on, Harp, let's talk about this before you make a fool out of yourself, Harp. - Take it easy. - Hey, Harp, let it go. (deep dark music) Stop it, Harp! (grunting) - Stop it, Snookie! (grunting) Stop it! Will you listen to me! Stop it, what are you guys doing? - Harp! (fast tense music) Harp, I didn't wanna kill you! I didn't wanna do it to you, Harp! (mumbles) (grunting) (deep tense music) - [Katherine] Webb and Snookie, I can't believe it. - Me either. - [Katherine] I'm gonna go call for help. - No wait, we don't know who could be listening. You're gonna have to go tell Collins what happened. - Well, where are you going? - [Jacob] (mumbleS) something out of Blood Canyon. (deep tense music) - Any problem? - The rest of your money will be deposited in your Swiss accounts by noon tomorrow. Isn't technology wonderful, Mr. Bartel? Instead of stealing the jet, we steal a circuit board and we have the entire guts of an aircraft on one thin piece of silica. It's over, Mr. Bartel, you can take off the war paint now. All we have to do is pick up our 100 million and decide how to spend it. - Gonna use the money to hire a good attorney. I hear the dream team's looking for work. - You see, Mr. Bartel, a good lesson for us. - [Mr. Bartel] Yeah, I always take out the trash. - Throw your weapons down, put your hands behind your head and get down on your knees. - Or what? (deep dark music) - I do think he means it. (gun firing) - You put your hands behind your head. Now! Can I kill him slowly? (deep dark music) (groaning) Damn Indians. (fast tense music) (grunting) - Harper, thank you. (sirens ringing) - You okay? (soft serene music) It looks like I might have to stick around until you heal up. - Yeah, looks like it. - But then I'm going. (soft serene music) - Can I come? - Yeah, I would like that, I'd really like that. (soft serene music) (deep tense music)
