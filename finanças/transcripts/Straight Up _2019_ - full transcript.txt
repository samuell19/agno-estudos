I wish I didn't have any holes. If I didn't have to worry about things going in and out of my holes, life would be so much easier. Sure I'd have to give up talking and I like talking, but I'd also get to give up public rest rooms. I mean there's always something on the seat lid, it's just like why? Historically I will choose the handicap stall which is my personal favorite because it's usually the cleanest and it has the most leg room. But lately I've been experiencing increased anxiety that some kid in a wheelchair will be waiting outside the stall when I exit and he's going to glare at me once he sees that I'm clearly physically unafflicted. The more times I use the handicap stall, the likelier it is to happen. It's like a car crash, it's not a matter of if, it's just a matter of when. But then if I don't drive a car, how will I get anywhere when the bus is unreliable and filled with homeless people? Or social delinquents who resemble homeless people. I suppose if you were truly homeless you wouldn't take the bus either because you couldn't afford it or have nowhere to go, one or the other. Todd I think we're getting a bit off topic. Well it's my job to be tangential, it's your job to magically relate everything to my problems. Okay you treat sex like the kid in a wheelchair. The handicap stall is a metaphor for your state of sexual confusion, and you're afraid of the kid because he might tell you you're in a wheelchair too. But I'm not in a wheelchair. You're in an emotional wheelchair. So does that mean I'm not gay? I don't know, it's just a metaphor. I think I might not be gay. - You're gay. - You don't know that. Todd your favorite film is "Legally Blonde". Well that's just it, I've always dismissed the possibility of having any heterosexual feelings, but I think that's because I've been socially conditioned to be gay, gay, gay. Kids have been calling me a faggot at recess since the second grade, I never really had the opportunity to explore the female gender. So you wanna start dating girls? I think it would statistically improve my love life. Don't take this the wrong way, but even if you wanted to experiment, I don't think you would find anyone. Girls aren't gay-blind anymore, this isn't the '60s. And you're no Rock Hudson. I don't think that I'm that transparent, I could just be metro. Or a hipster. Todd you're like a Kinsey six. Maybe a five when you're not wearing cashmere. Well I think that I can get it down to a three. Francis says that - my masculinity has been - His therapist. suppressed by my own precognitions of sexual identity, and she think that I could be happier if I'm more aggressive and I don't let political labels like gay define me. Sorry political labels? Yes we choose to be gay. Can I choose to punch you in the face right now? I don't mean that we choose who we're attracted to. Okay both of you stop. Todd do you like gay sex? He wouldn't know, - he's never had any. - What, no really? I can't, it makes me think of poop, And I don't like poop. The smell, the image, the sound, the texture, not that I've ever touched it, oh God even thinking about poop makes me want to vomit. Does thinking about vomit make you wanna poo? Okay no one likes poop. I could offer an anecdote to the contrary. What about Jerry? You at least gave him a blow job. For a few seconds, it was more of a blow consultation. Maybe you're bisexual. No I'm sorry this is recockulous. Todd you can not decide that you're straight just because you don't like the gay people you've been meeting. I like girls, I've always liked girls. They're pretty, and they're clean and they're soft. You can find all those qualities in a decorative pillow. No you can't they're not always soft, that's why they're not called functional pillows and for two they're not always clean unless you steam them. - Oh my God. - Todd I think you're missing the point. No you're missing the point. I'm undergoing a severe sexual identity crisis and neither of my only two friends are taking me seriously. Okay I am sorry. I support you so does Ryder. - Yay. - Thank you, because I do need your help. I'm still a little bit scared of the p-word. - Pillow? - Poop? No you know, meow. Okay Todd, if you can't say the word pussy, you're definitely gay. I can say it, I just think it's vulgar. Then say it. Pussy. Todd say I wanna fuck some pussy. I wanna fuck some pussy. I'm straight. I'm straight. I'm straight, I like bean burritos and motorcycles and motorcycles and pussy. - Hi. - Hi. Do you come here a lot? - What? - I said do you come here a lot? Oh I thought you said do I come a lot. That's not what I said. Yes on both accounts. My boyfriend is a god. Well as long as he doesn't support religious genocide. You're so cute! My friend Tracy would love you. - Tracy! - Somebody rang? Is anybody sitting here? No I'm completely alone. Are you all right? No I'm not. - Okay. - My best friend from home was supposed to fly into L.A. for my birthday, but then some pigeon ran into the engine... Oh my God. Avian ingestion? That's literally my third worst nightmare. What was the death count? What? No it just got delayed but then now I have no one to buy me drinks. I can buy you a drink. Really? Do you wanna be my birthday buddy? - Okay. - Yay, let's do shots. My momma wanted me to go to Ohio State but I was like, "I'm turning 18!" That's 40 in pop star years. Wait how old are you now? 18 but don't worry, my momma installed me with Southern values. I do not hook up. Like that Kelly Clarkson song, "I Do Not Hook Up". - Instilled. - What? And I think Ohio's in the Midwest. What are you tryna say? So you shouldn't have southern values. Oh yeah you're right. I'm in L.A. now. You've like done this before right? Oh yeah, yeah lots of times. Oh good. Me too. So many times. - Oh God what is that? - What's wrong? Oh my God! Get it off ooh! It was like that scene in "Alien" after they eat dinner with the, you know that scene? Well I don't pay you to laugh at me. Your parents pay me. Yeah well. Frankly Todd, I'm surprised by your behavior. You're willfully barking up the wrong tree, but I'm unclear as to what you're even chasing. Is it sex? Is it love? What do you want? I don't know what I want. I know what I don't want. I don't wanna be alone for the rest of my life. Excuse me do you work here? Tell me you don't love me. Tell me you don't love me and I'll let you get on that Korean Air flight and never look back. My whole life I've been waiting for you to appear in my life and make me whole. That was good Rory. I think she should be crying the this scene though, so take a minute and then we'll try again. - Okay. - And I see on your special skills you can do a Zooey Deschanel impression. I'd love to hear it. It's so soft, I can't believe it's not cotton. I'm probably gonna take that off. Do you have any other questions before we give this another whirl? No, no I mean yes, are you really asking or is that just an obligatory gesture? I'm really asking. This isn't a comedy right? - No. - So Jenna has a genius IQ, it say she's runway gorgeous and she studies Jujutsu. I am having some trouble understanding why she'd be attracted to Jonah who doesn't work out, he's unemployed and they have absolutely nothing in common. Remember Jenna has a troubled past. Right yes, dead dad. Which I get 'cause I have that, so I can understand if it was like a whole solace, I just wanna fuck the pain away kind of thing, although you'd think with all her CIA training she'd develop some equanimity. But she chooses to stay with him in Wisconsin over potentially thwarting a North Korean nuclear missile crisis I mean that's, that's a lot. People do crazy things when they're in love. Okay now you're just quoting "Hercules". Right, you done cleaning up? Hi yes yeah I am. Again I'm so sorry I was late, my audition went really long and the 405 was backed up. - Just... - No don't even worry about it yeah I'm firing you. - What? - I would have fired you when you got in but Jamie called in sick, - and we were short-handed. - Why didn't you fire Jamie? I like Jamie, and you clearly don't want to be a waitress so. Who the fuck wants to be a waitress? The food here sucks! Oh put that back! Put I back! Is this seat taken? Does it look like it's taken? Don't deflect move - the story forward. - Okay. No would you like to join me for a cup of joe? Have I seen you somewhere before? Maybe, are you familiar with the filmography of Lars Von Trier? So you're an actress? Do you want my autograph? Have you ever done a sex scene? Hmm. Does rape count? No. Okay Rory, um. We're not gonna tell you what you can and can't say. We're not the PC police but rape is never funny. I thought it was funny. I didn't laugh. It's not like I was mocking rape victims, I was mocking actors. Uh-huh, not everybody can make that distinction. Well it's not my fault if people are fucking stupid. My best friend was date raped in college. That made me feel really uncomfortable. See Rory. It's different for people who've actually been affected by sexual abuse. Yes I would know, thank you. If you need to talk to someone, my best friend really loves her therapist. Your date rape friend? No, Colleen moved to Boston. We don't really talk any more. Hey Karen it's your daughter. Just calling to chat. How's Sri Lanka? I hear they have great... What do they have in Sri Lanka? Anyway I'm trying to be less negative so I'm gonna sandwich technique this for you. It didn't rain. So that's positive. I got fired and everybody in my improv class thinks I'm a huge bitch and I got a parking ticket and I think there's a dead mouse in my garbage disposal. So that's my negative thing. That's all 24 hours so it counts as one thing. And positive, positive, what's positive? Oh I thought I saw Amy Adams at Trader Joes. But it was just Isla Fischer. So. I'm out here living the dream. Hey, you know that saying shoot for the moon, even if you miss you'll land among the stars? I did some research and apparently the closest star excluding our sun, is still four light years away from Earth. So if you miss the moon, you don't land on anything ever. You just float aimlessly in space until you die. Okay so call me back sometime or whatever. Bye. Excuse me do you work here? No but I get that a lot, I don't know why. You're restocking the shelves. Oh some of the books are out of order. Yeah but it's not your job. Valid. Counterpoint, I was at Staples the other day and somebody asked me if we sold paperweights and I wasn't doing anything, I was just standing there. Were you wearing a red shirt? No. I know what your problem is, you have a very friendly demeanor, like you look super helpful. Can I fix that? Yeah sure, don't make eye contact, don't smile. The more you can project an air of antipathy, the less you'll be approached. It's not a hobby, it's a way of life. I'm ignoring you. - It's convincing. - I can practice later. Sorry am I in your way? Everything's sort of in disarray at the moment. I'm in the it gets worse before it gets better phase. No, no you're fine, I just, the library is hiring, I wanted to drop off my resume to a corporeal entity if possible. - Good word. Corporeal. - Thank you. And antipathy, you said that earlier. Yeah that's one of my go-to smart people words. It's your smart people what? You know that handful of words that you overuse in conversations to impress strangers even if they don't really fit like, my worst offenders are emblematic and perspicacity. You don't do that do you? I'm sorry, ignore me, I am pretentious apparently. My middle name is pretentious. - What? - So we're even Steven. Is that a joke? Like danger is my middle name. No my middle name is Preston. It's a pretentious name, I'm trying to relate to you. Right. Preston is pretentious. - Yeah. - Yeah. Some would say that it is Prestontious. Would they? If it's a joke yeah. Copy. My first name is Todd. Hi Todd, I'm Rory. - I like that name. - Thank you. It reminds me of Rory Gilmore. You watch "Gilmore Girls"? I watch "Gilmore Girls", I own all the seven seasons on DVD. I own all seven seasons on DVD. I almost went to Yale because of that show. I almost went to Yale because of the show. - I didn't get in obviously. - I did. That sucks I'm sorry. Oh, favorite Rory boyfriend on one, two, three - Jesse. - Jesse obviously. Do you think I'm gay? - Pardon? - One can like "Gilmore Girls" - and be not gay. - I wasn't assuming anything. Okay because both my friends think I'm gay, so I didn't want you to, last week I had sex with a girl. Well woman, well girl. Good for you. Sorry I don't know why I said that. I'm not bragging I only got my hand in. Not because she was gay or I'm gay because she was a virgin - and then I just... - No it's fine, - really I believe you. - Oh. I just didn't want you to label me so. I don't, labels are for vegans as I sometimes say. I eat meat. I, you know, feel bad for the animals. I prefer to eat smaller animals like chickens, because the smaller you are the less likely you are to feel pain. I didn't know that. Might not be true I haven't looked into it thoroughly. I already have a lot of guilt on my plate so. - Hm? - What? Oh nothing I just, I thought maybe you wanted to ask me something. So you said you're an actress, have I seen you in anything? Maybe have you seen "2 Girls 1 Cup"? No when did it come out? Oh I'm just kidding sorry, I hate that question. When did it come out? No have I seen you in anything? Because like you haven't, but anyway it's a porn video. You were in a porn video? No, no, no, "2 Girls 1 Cup' is a porn, you've never really? Oh well it's two girls, and then they shit into a cup, - it's really gross. - Oh no, - yeah if you could, no, just - I'm sorry, - change, I'm a visual person. - Oh, oh let me... Change the topic - please yeah. - Okay sure great, what do you do? Well I get intrusive thoughts, so I keep replaying that imagery - over and over in my head. - No, no, no, for work, for work, for work, for work, what do you do? Software coding and I house sit as a side hobby but mostly just to meet people. Who do you meet house sitting? The owners before they leave. Oh. Whose house is this? My first cousin once removed chiropractor's ex-wife. And what does she do? I didn't ask, you have a very symmetrical face. - Thank you. - I'm developing an app called Face Value that leverages machine learning to measure facial bilateral symmetry on a scale of one to 10. You can tell a lot about a person by their face. Yeah what does my face say? Oh I'm glad you asked. Facial symmetry indicates - extraversion, - Sometimes. - Lower levels of neuroticism, - Nope. - And developmental stability. - Definitely not. It's true, they've done studies. Ah yeah well to invalidate that research, I don't have a dad, my mom was, she still is, a surgeon for doctor's without boarders so she was always gone and my brother basically raised me. Except he got addicted to heroin, he stole a bunch of money from my nana, we kinda don't talk anymore, it's a bit fucked up. Why am I telling you this? I don't know. I do. I have a theory that millennials over share because we're the most godless generation. So that's why we confess everything on social media, it's sort of our way to cling to some kind of permanence. Are you on social media? - No are you? - No. Well it's just a theory. - Oh I see it now. - What? Your drug addict brother, he's right... So what's your face value? Six point two. - That doesn't sound good. - It's not. I have a deviated septum, a triangle of moles on this side, and then only one dimple. That's ironic you know? Guy obsessed with symmetry has crooked face. You must hate yourself. Yeah most of the time. Oh no I didn't mean, no. Don't, I'm just fucking with you, don't hate yourself, that's sad. Okay. So you're legit OCD right? You're not just like, "Oh I'm so OCD I save the red skittles for last."? Oh I do save the red skittles for last. - Oh. - But I'm also a checker and a washer and I don't fly. You don't fly, how do you get anywhere? I don't need to go anywhere. - Paris? - Small fridges. - New York? - I can drive to New York. - Have you? - No but I've seen "Taxi Driver" and "Cloverfield" so I get the idea. You know driving is way more dangerous than flying right? Not the way I drive. Do you see a psychiatrist? Yes but mostly I see a psychoanalyst because I like to talk a lot, and I used to do cognitive behavioral therapy to help with my phobias. What are you afraid of? Everything under the sun. - The sun. - You're afraid of the sun? Yeah I try to avoid it. Especially during the hours of 10 a.m. and four p.m. when the UV rays are the most potent because I'm afraid it's going to expedite my cancer. Oh wait, you have cancer? Oh not yet. But I will. - You will? - Uh-huh. There's a 44% chance that I'll develop some form of cancer throughout my lifetime and I've never been exceptionally lucky. But you need serotonin. Sunlight's good for your soul. I know, I don't get enough and it stresses me out and the worst part is that stress causes cancer. It's a vicious cycle. It really is. So are you afraid of dying too soon or just dying in general? The latter, I don't wanna die ever. Oh see I'm the opposite, I already know how I wanna die. I am 90 and I just won my second Oscar, I used to say third but I don't wanna be unrealistic, and I fall asleep hugging a panda and then she falls asleep and then she rolls over and accidentally smothers me. - Well that sounds nice. - But I can understand, I can understand not wanting to die prematurely, 'cause like if I died now before I've done anything you know like, significant, I would be livid. Well I doubt many people would be jumping in their boots to die. Like happy people. Except for suicidal people. I don't hang out with those people. But they're probably not the jumping type. I know some. Unless it's off of a bridge or something. But seriously if I died now I would literally kill somebody. - Literally? - Well no, oh no! Oh God, that's one of my biggest pet peeves. I can't believe I just fucking did that. Well they say that things you don't like about other people are usually problems that you have with yourself. Okay first of all, who says that? Nobody says that, that is rude. Second of all I did mean literally. What you'd literally kill somebody? To be not dead? Yeah. Like I'm not saying I'd go out and sign up to be a terrorist, but if somebody put a gun to my head and they said, "Hey kill that guy or I'm gonna kill you." I'd be like, "Hey sorry man, "I gotta lookout for number one." No matter who it was? Well maybe if it was like, no, I'd let Obama die. - Your parents? - They've had their time. - A baby? - I would definitely - kill a baby. - What? Oh come on, think about how much time and investment goes into raising a well adjusted adult. I am college educated, I have a great sense of humor, I'm going to be a famous actress, I am way more beneficial to society than a useless, resource-consuming baby. - Wow. - It would be like painting the Mona Lisa white to start fresh. What if that baby was the next Picasso? Or a more likely scenario, what if he was a gangbanger? Or a heroin addict or just had a real crooked face like you? I'm joking, Todd I'm joking. I'm sorry you're really easy. No I just, it's the same reason I don't wanna have kids. I figure Murphy's law if I had kids I'd probably end up like the mother in "We Need to Talk About Kevin". Oh I though that was gonna be one of those movies where they say the title somewhere in the dialogue, and I kept waiting for it to happen and it never did and it really bothered me. Not the massacre itself, just the fact that nobody ever said, we need to talk about Kevin? Yeah, it just wasn't right. My mom wants me to have kids. She wants me to have kids and she wants me to save the planet and I'm like, "Fuck can I just do what makes me happy?" You know like isn't that why our forefathers bombed and pillaged other countries so that I could be happy? And as much as I pretend to give no fucks what my mother things invariably, the only way that I can justify being an actor, which is like the epitome of vanity, is to be a disgustingly rich philanthropist like Paul Newman and trying to be Paul Newman all the time is way too much pressure. Tell me about it. What would you do, would you shoot the baby? - I'd shoot the baby. - Thank you. But if it was you or me, I'd shoot me. Hey, are you okay? Yeah sorry, it's just the wine and the cake and we've been talking for eight hours. Why are you so nice? - Oh I'm not that nice. - Yes you are. No I'm not. You're the nicest person in L.A. Really I'm not. I lie to homeless people, I always have change I just don't give it to them. I think I'm depressed. Well that's okay. I'm depressed too. I should lie down. Well if you feel like you're gonna throw up, - don't. - Okay. I don't know why I'm here. I don't mean existentially, specifically L.A. I hate meeting people. "So what do you do?" "I'm an actress." "Oh have I seen you in anything?" "Oohh" Go fuck yourself, no offense. I usually lie and say I'm a geospatial analyst or something because the truth is, and I know I know that all yuppies are miserable because we have these chimerical expectations that that will inevitably falter to reality because we can't accept that we are not as special as we think we are. But I don't care about them. I care about me and I was valedictorian in high school. Which shouldn't mean anything except that it does, it means I was better than 87 other people, small private school. You know I honestly thought that I would be an outlier, like that Malcolm Gladwell book "Outliers" that I read at the Starbucks across from CAA, but nothing ever fucking manifests and I'm already old! When did that happen? And I know that they say it's who you know or rather who knows you, but nobody knows me, nobody really knows me and I keep going out for these stupid fucking student films where everything is a dream, and I don't even get a callback and I didn't even want it anyway and I must be dreaming, I must be dreaming! I must be out of my fucking mind and I am so poor! But you're a great actress. You've never even see me act. Oh yeah that's true. But I can just tell I mean, you're smart and you're funny and you're clean and that's all you need. - Oh stop it. - No really, you've a start personality. You're like Katherine Hepburn. "The stage is really life buster ha, ha, ha, ha." That was really good. Thanks. Can I hold your hand? Hi you've reached Todd. I'm sorry I missed you but please leave your name, number, time and date you called in that order, followed by any other pertinent information and I will get to you as soon as reasonably possible. Hi it's Rory, my number is 206-377-2616, it's like two thirtyish on a Wednesday, and I, sorry I have another call hold on. Oh it's you okay, I'll talk to you in a second. - Hello? - Hi you called? You called first. Oh right, you're still unemployed? There must have been a gentler way to phrase that but yes. Good, so a friend of one of my clients asked me to house-sit for her while she's vacationing in Europe but it's a bit of a drive so I wanted to see if you were available. - She's driving to Europe? - No what? - You lost me. - I'm house sitting - in Monterey. - Oh. But I can't drive for that long by myself or I'll asleep and die so I wanted to see if you'd be interested in joining me? I'll pay you. - Okay. - Yeah? I didn't know if you could get away with auditions and all. Wait why wouldn't she just hire someone more local? I organize closets, I have great references. Of course you do. The only thing is, how do you feel about dogs? - Dogs? - Yes dogs, I normally adhere to a strict no pets policy, but if you're with me I could be persuaded. The deal-breaker is that you have to be the poop picker-upper. Stop. You had me at 'I'll pay you.' Okay are you ready? - I think so. - Okay and you have to look right at me and keep a straight face. - Okay. - And no frowning - 'cause that's cheating okay? - Okay. Okay Baby! Oh come on man! You didn't even let me finish. You suck. Okay your turn. What's the line again? Baby if you love me, won't you please just give me a smile? Baby if you love me, won't you please just give me a smile? Baby I love you but I just can't smile. Weak, weak choice. Okay, okay. Baby if you love me, won't you please just give me a smile? Baby I love you but I just can't smile, what the fuck was that? - Are you trying? - I am trying, I'm just not good at this game. It's because you're self-conscious. Look if you wanna make me smile, you have to humiliate yourself in a way that isn't like cute or endearing. Have ugly, will travel. Okay. Baby if you love me, won't you please just give me a smile? Yes? Huh, yeah, yeah? Ah that was a smile. Ah I win! You didn't smile on purpose, did you? I don't know, I don't know maybe. Okay. Baby if you love me, won't you please just give me a smile? Baby I love you but I just can't smile. Do you wanna be my girlfriend? Hi. Rory I'm so glad to finally meet you, Todd has been MIA forever. - Three months. - Yeah that's like 24 months in bitch years, and you didn't tell me that Rory's so pretty. Oh thank you. I mean you look like a model. I am a model. You clearly haven't heard anything about me. And this is my boo Zane. He's also a model but mostly underwear. - Hi Zane. - So updates, give, give. Well we just got back from San Diego. - Professional house sitters. - Ah. Bangin'. Zane's from London. Note the vernacular. We also sit dogs, no cats. I'm allergic, she just hates them. - I do. - We should tell Danny for the holidays. - He's got that tiny wiener. - Okay enough business. Rory how did you two meet? Well it's kind of funny, actually Todd do you wanna tell it? Well you tell it better. Stop I love already. We met in the self-help section at the library. He was stocking shelves, so I thought he worked there and I was looking for a job. Aww but you found him instead. So cute. All of it. How did you and Zane meet? - Mutual friends. - Group sex party. Rory what do you do? I'm a geospatial analyst. She's an actress. Well I totally believed you. Do you have an agent? Should I get one, are they helpful? - Oh my God yes. - You can't book anything - without one. - I know sorry I'm looking. Is anyone getting food? Oh we're on a cleanse but you should try their artisan flatbread. My treat. I just wanna smell it. Oh we shouldn't we're having a pizza tomorrow night. - Can we do that Thursday? - Well we're making - Mongolian Thursday. - Right, right. You plan out all your suppers in advance. Well it's our Doc night. Doc night, is that some role play thing? I enjoy spanking. Every Thursday we watch a documentary to keep our relationship cognitively stimulating. This Thursday we're watching "The Story of the Weeping Camel" because it's set in Mongolia so we thought it'd be ironic if we were eating Mongolian. Well it wouldn't be ironic. It would be ironic if we were eating camel. I don't think that Whole Foods sells camel. - Was that a joke? - Was it not funny? - It was okay. - Scale of one to six? Who scales one to six? Oh my God, who are you dressing up as for Ryder's birthday party? Ryder's having a birthday party? Yeah the theme is iconic movie couples. I thought you'd be on the at like Asian on rice. Didn't you get the Evite? White on rice. Yeah but don't Asians eat more rice? I didn't get the Evite. Oh well you know Ryder, he's fag-get-ful. Are you making fun of my accent? Oh no I'm saying he's fag-get-ful, because he's a fag who's forgetful. You can't say fag in America. Well Todd made it up. - Is that right Todd? - No I... Anyway you have to come. Plus Marcus Stafford will be there, and he would be a perect talent manager for Rory. - Really? - Yeah! I mean he's always saying that his clients are shit but I'm sure he would love you. Fucking A, I feel like Sandra Bullock in "The Blind Side". Making dreams come true. We need to go home, I think I left the toaster on. You didn't leave the toaster on. We could go home and play The Game of Life and turn off the toaster. We're never playing that game again, you get too emotional also the toasters always off unless you put toast in it. You don't put toast in a toaster. - I meant bread. - Well you said toast. You know what I meant Todd. The toaster is always on unless you unplug it, and I forgot to unplug it so it's on. You do not forget to unplug things, so either you're being paranoid or you're making up excuses to avoid going inside. Both are scenarios I refuse to accommodate. Okay fine but if you get bored and you wanna leave, just use the safe word. - What's the safe word? - I don't know, we haven't picked one yet. How about snollygoster? It's not very discreet, how would I slip it into a sentence? Honey have you seen my snollygoster? What's a snollygoster? You're right, people will ask questions. I'm just saying how funny would it have been if "The Fifth Element" had been dick? Oh my God. Todd. Ryder. Happy birthday. It has been so long, I think I thought you were dead. And you must be Rory. Hi nice to meet you. - You're Todd's girlfriend. - Yes. How is that going? It's a ball. Super. Is that for me? It is yeah, Todd picked it out. It's from Crate and Barrel. Don't tell him that. It's not from Crate and Barrel. If you don't like it, there's a gift receipt. You know what? I bet I'm gonna love it, because our Todd here has the aesthetic taste of a well-oiled woman. - Where should I put it? - That's what Todd said. The guest bedroom is down the hall, it's the second door on your right. Okay. You're fine. Oh okay, yeah I'm fine. Okay so like she's in on it then? In on what? You're Paul Newman in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof". Oh you got it, we were worried nobody would recognize us. Oh God Todd, you must know that he was gay right? Paul Newman? No he's not. His character, his character was gay. That's why they never had any sex. I didn't pick up on that at all. I think you just see subliminal homosexuality - even when... - Todd no. He was gay okay? The film was make in the '50s, so Hollywood censored the gayness and you would know that if you had ever read the fucking play. I just like the movie. - Babe! - Hi! Oh right Todd this is Trent. Trent this is Todd. Guess which movie couple we are. "Brokeback Mountain"? No. He's Butch Cassidy and I'm the Sundance Kid, because I'm a total bottom. Stop making Paul Newman gay. Okay? There is no evidence. Oh I heard he slept with James Dean. - He did. - No he was married to Joanne for 50 years and they were very happy. Baby is this your gay friend that's dating a girl? That's the one. Do you guys have sex or? I don't have to answer that. - That's a no. - We're just taking it slow. And that's denial. Pussies are gross. Semen for the win. Todd doesn't like bodily fluids. You know pussies have juices right? They spray at you like Spider-man. You're making me uncomfortable. Oh I'm sorry, I have a big mouth. He's not exaggerating. I just think it's kind of sad that you haven't found yourself. It's a waste. He's cute though right? Yeah he's okay. - I'm gonna go find Rory. - Okay. - Baby did you and Todd ever? - No. That's what I thought. Wow. - Rory? - Meg. Come sit with us. You look so pretty, who are you? Oh thank you. I'm Elizabeth Taylor - from "Cat on... - "on a Hot Tin Roof". Oh my God, whoa you and Todd have a bitchin' sense of humor. I don't get it. Okay so Liz is married to Paul Newman, and shit hits the fan because he's secretly gay. I don't think that's what happens. Didn't you read the play? In the play it's obvi that he has the hots for Skipper. Oh I just like the movie. Oh because you said Todd is gay. Oh no it's okay, it's okay. Todd told me everybody used to think he was gay. We didn't just think he was gay. He was gay. Like he went to gay bars, he had a gay eHarmony account, he sucked Jerry's gay willy willingly. - What? - Oh just the tip, but that was before you. Don't worry. He's totally crazy about you. Right, right yeah I know. Can I ask you a personal question? How's Todd in bed? Well you know he, he is great. I knew it. He's just so attentive right? I bet he's one of those guys who makes it all about pleasing you. Like I literally have to drag Zane's tongue to my clit. Well maybe if you shaved. Shut the fuck up! I had a skin infection so I stopped. You're one to talk, Bushy McPhearson. - I love your sass. - I love your ass. God I'm so funny! Todd? We're doing cake bitches. Let's go. Rory meet Marcus. He's a talent manager. Rory is a phenomenal actress. Oh she's never seen me act. Yeah you got a good look. You're attractive in an ordinary sort of way. The kind of thing you'd find at a Supercuts in Puerto Rico. - Thanks. - You know one of my clients, she keeps nagging me and she's like, "Marcus you never send me out anymore." And it's like, "baby I try, "but there's just only so many roles "every year for a female troll." I'd drop her if she wasn't my niece. It is ironic because rain on your wedding day is considered good luck even though it's a logistical nightmare. Rain is not good luck. It's a cultural belief that a wet knot is harder to untie. Fine whatever it doesn't matter, it's not ironic, it's a logical paradox. It would be ironic if you were marrying a meteorologist named Sonny Weathers and you planned an outdoor summer wedding in Arizona and then it rained but only if he set the date. What if Sonny weathers wanted it to rain because it's considered good luck and so his forecast was right, - is it ironic then? - What? Yes, no, no Todd it's still not. Okay fine 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife. - It's not ironic! - How can you say that? Like if I work at a spoon factory and it's somebody's birthday and I made them a cake but I forgot the knife and I'm like, "Hey does anybody have a knife?" Nope but ironically we have 10,000 spoons! No because you should have remembered the knife. You wouldn't expect there to be a knife at a spoon factory. It's not ironic, it's just unfortunate. It would be ironic if it was a knife factory but they have a policy against using company knives for personal use and then you had nothing to cut the fucking cake with Todd that would be ironic. Well I think you have a very narrow definition of the word ironic. No you're missing the point. She's transpired an entire generation of adolescents who just causally toss the word around to the point where irony has lost its whole fucking meaning. It hasn't lost its meaning, it's just evolved, language is fluid. Yeah well you'd be one to talk about fluidity. And how would you like me to extrapolate that statement? You know what's really ironic? Arguing about an Alanis Morissette song with your gay boyfriend. I don't see the irony in that, and if that's an accusation then I will have you know that Ryder is an unreliable source. Did you know he cheated on his eye exam? You can't cheat on an eye exam Todd! He did, he just memorized the letters. Okay Meg said and I quote, you sucked Jerry's gay willy willingly. Well that is hearsay, and as such it's inadmissible. You're really not going to admit it? No I won't admit it because it was just a couple of licks and it didn't mean anything. Oh my God it means you're gay. It means that I'm possibly bisexual if you feel obliged to pigeonhole me into a category of sexual identity that you can easily apprehend. Okay fine I admit that I've dabbled in male-on-male courting in the past, but I found it repulsive and I'm with you now, and I chose and you're a woman, what else do you need to know? Why haven't you ever tried to have sex with me? I don't like bodily fluids. You can't use your OCD as an excuse for everything. Just because you can control your brain, doesn't mean it's a universal skill-set. And I don't recall you attempting to sex me either and have I accused you of being a lesbian? Yeah well it's different for me. Why is it different for you? - Because - Because why? Because you are supposed to be the man. Well that's really sexist, and frankly you should feel offended. Todd, we have been dating for six months and you haven't even tried to fondle my boobs. This is not normal. Well being normal is vastly overrated. Oh my God, you're quoting "Sabrina the Teenage Witch"! - You are so gay. - It's "Halloweentown". Whatever still gay! Fine there does that make you happy? No, God stop it. Well what do you want? I want a real relationship. This is a real relationship. No, no this is playing house. Our names are not on the lease, and even if we were married it would be annulled because there's been no fucking consummation. - Well that's redundant. - What? Fucking consummation, it's redundant. - Focus Todd. - Sorry fine let's do it. - What? - Sex let's do the sex. - Right now? - No not now, I'm hardly in the right frame of mind right now. Tonight then I guess? Yeah okay tonight. It's tonight. It came so fast. It does that. I'm just gonna take a shower first. - There you go. - Aww. Okay I think we need to talk about the elephant in the room. The white elephant. Sure yeah the color doesn't really matter. Well the phrase is the white elephant in the room. No it's not. Yes it is, it's derived from the short story, "Hills Like White Elephants." - Wait what? - By Ernest Hemingway. Yeah no I know I've read it. Do you know what that story's about? - Abortion. - Okay yes. But they never explicitly say the word abortion, it's the white elephant in the room, the thing nobody wants to talk about. No you're mixed up, the white elephant is the unborn baby. Well unborn baby, abortion, I think you're arguing semantics. No it's not semantics, the elephant in the room is the thing nobody wants to talk about, the white elephant is an unwanted possession that's a bitch to get rid of, you're like mixing two separate idioms. What? Are you sure? Yes. - So then what's the origin... - Todd forget the fucking elephants. We need to talk about sex. So sex is the white elephant? No it's the elephant in the room! Okay I'm sorry, why are you getting so angry? Because you're not listening to me. I am listening, I'm just confused. You're confused? I'm confused. Do you want sex? Only if you do. Okay well I don't. Okay good. Great. Wonderful. I realize that I may have undermined your OCD. I just have to accept that you don't like bodily fluids, so maybe sex isn't on your agenda. And for me I mean, we know that I think intercourse is a primitive national pastime that's been overblown by the media and popular culture. And copulation is only intended for reproduction, and we both hate babies. So really the question is why do we wanna ruin our relationship with sex? - We don't. - I concur. Also objectively to a random bystander who didn't know we were having intimacy problems, we look just like Paul and Joanne. And who cares what society thinks anyway? - Right? - And it would be ridiculous to say that we're just best friends. I mean we live together, we sleep together, we kiss sometimes with tongue, - your crumbs are falling. - Sorry. It's okay I'll vacuum later, and you give great back massages which let's be honest, is basically comparable to an orgasm anyway. And you know maintaining routine, passionate sex is a hurdle for any couple. When you think about it, we're just throwing the towel early. Exactly I mean 65% of married couples stop having sex after 10 years. - Really? - I don't know, I just made that number up. Well it sounds like a real statistic. It does doesn't it? I'm so glad we had this talk. Me too. Oh so sex is the white elephant - because its the thing - It's the thing - we wanna get rid of. - we wanna get rid of okay, okay that's true you're right. Are you happy? Yes. And why do you think that is? Because if you love someone enough, you can change. The other day I was re-reading "The Life-Changing Magic "of Tidying Up" and I accidentally ripped page 138 and it didn't ever bother me. That much. Good for you. I did get rid of the book, but only because it was no longer bringing me joy. Anyway Rory makes me a better person, I'm not crying, my hand eczema is gone, I'm watching more documentaries. It's so funny to think I was in here just six months ago complaining about how I was gonna be alone forever. What a hoot. You know Todd, I have to admit when I told you to experiment with your heterosexual inklings, I wasn't sure it was the best idea, but you actually may be somewhat straight. Like a Kinsey 3. Thank you, that means so much coming from you. You're welcome. Will you be spending Thanksgiving with your parents? I will yes and I'm bringing Rory. How exciting. Please remind them that they still owe me for September. I sent them an invoice. Pleased to meet you, I'm Topanga. - Nice to meet you. - We're so happy to have you. - This is my husband. - Come on in, come on. Oh take off your shoes. - Oh yeah okay. - She doesn't have to do that right away. Okay so when can we expect grandkids? - Mother. - What? Rory is the first girl that you've brought home. It's my cultural duty to torment you in front of her. Oh but we don't want children. They bring you unhappiness. Oh don't be so self-deprecating Todd, we forgive you. It's true, they've done studies. Parents report statistically lower levels of happiness and marital satisfaction compared to non-parents. That's funny I don't recall filing out a survey. Oh not all parent I'm sure. I'm sure you guys are outliers. But I can't handle irrational behavior, or crying or poop. Well having kids fills your life with purpose. But does that intangible sense of purpose outweigh the burden of lost sleep, time and income? Or are you justifying your actions? I have no buyers remorse. You were the second best decision I ever made. What was the first? Investing in Google. What am I? You're the fourth. Well we have everything we need. Why would we purposefully follow a path that could obstruct our personal happiness? Because there are some things in life that are more important than personal happiness. Like what? I don't know honey, why don't we just ask our friend Socrates? - Or Gandhi. - Maybe Harriet Tubman - would know. - That little blond kind - in "Pay it Forward". - Oh I love him, what ever happened to that kid? Okay point made. All right here's why you have kids. Now you're both healthy, intelligent, valuable contributors to society. So you have a biological imperative to pass on those genes because you know who's ruining this country? The Mexicans. - Wally. - Okay dad can we save the racism until after dessert? What I'm not saying that all Mexicans are stupid, I'm just saying and there's plenty of literature to back me up on this. There's an inverse correlation between intelligence and fertility and guess who's popping out the most babies? - Mexicans. - Bingo, and you all know - who's the smartest race. - Asians. God damn right. What he means is you would both make excellent parents. - No. - No, no what I mean is everything that is ultimately wrong with the world is caused by stupidity so smart people have an obligation to combat reverse Darwinism. Then why am I an only child? - You were enough. - Rory name a social issue. - Don't encourage him. - AIDS. AIDS wouldn't even exist if some fucking idiot didn't have sex with a monkey. That is, what? You know how I would eradicate stupid people? - Sarin gas. - No how? Here's what I would do. Every male should have a vasectomy at birth, just a little snip, snip. In order to qualify for a reverse vasectomy, the couple in question has to pass a series of aptitude tests. Okay now that's actually genius. No that is completely unethical. You cannot advance society by debasing natural human rights. And what I'm saying is that having children shouldn't be a right, it should be a privilege. Amen. Okay ethics aside, implementation would be impossible. - No government could ever... - Oh God Todd, stop being so pragmatic he's obviously being hypothetical. Listen to your girlfriend son. Okay hypothetically this would be a repressive caste system. There would be a proletarian revolution. You're right, instead of abortion clinics, we would have pregnancy clinics. Would that change the meaning of pro-choice? Oh and you just know that there'd be some sleezeball on Skid Row with a trench coat who is like, "Hey you wanna buy some sperm?" and it's probably not even human sperm. That's disgusting. Okay I have a hypothetical. What if a very smart, beautiful woman married a stupid man? Are you trying to say something? No it is true, she's just with me for the sex. Oh honey come on. Not in front of the kids. Oh come on, Todd is a big boy now. He should know that his old man still pitches like Roger Clemens. Yes he does. Is that a basketball person? Oh God look at that. Oh tiny boy. Todd you used to be so cheerful. What happened? The sweetest little baby. Oh my God this reminds me, I think it's in the garage honey, we have a video of Todd doing the Macarena to "Building a Mystery" and he called it, no, this is the best, he called it the Sarah MacLacharena. Can we find that? Oh gosh I'm gonna send Wally out to look for it. - Okay. - Oh wait, look at this one, that's in Venice. Where are you going sweetie? I have more. You seem well, you taking your meds? Yes. That girl is something else, - you really hit the jackpot. - Thank you. Todd I... Dad? I'm proud of you, I just want you to know that. Are your hands getting tired? No I can keep going. Did my dad seem unusually nice to you? Yeah he's awesome. Your mom is doubly awesome because she's 50% less racist. Yeah. I know this is my anxiety talking. I just, I always thought my parents loved me unconditionally, and tonight it felt like they loved me more. Like they were relieved that you were a girl and I kept thinking that if I brought a boy home it wouldn't have been like that. They wouldn't have used the good chard, the turkey would have been dry, my dad wouldn't hug me, he'd just shake my hand. I know. Why am I thinking that right? Stupid brain. Okay my turn. I think they're just happy that you're happy. Yeah you're probably right. - Todd. - Meg. Rory, merry holidays. We brought fluffernutters. Bitchin'. You can put them next to the jello shots. Don't spaz but Ryder brought Jerry. - Jerry who? - Blow job Jerry, but don't spaz I'm sure he won't say anything you don't want him to say. God, this is so awkward right? - Is it? - You know Todd is such a sweet guy, I'm so happy for you guys. I guess he didn't like me, but whatever, what are you gonna do right? And you are here with... Ryder. Yeah, he invited me last minute. You know I didn't think he liked me either. He usually doesn't even respond to my texts. But you know what, I bet somebody else bailed and he just invited me because he knew I'd be available. Tonight should be fun though. - Cybill Shepherd. - Ellen Degeneres. - Novak Djokovic. - Ellen Degeneres. Heath Ledger. - Judy Garland. - Ellen Degeneres. - Ruth Bader Ginsburg. - Ellen Degeneres. None of them are Ellen Degeneres! Could be. - Ellen Degeneres. - Tracy Chapman. - Yes, yes, yes we win! - Yes! 28, 62. We beat you so bad. You didn't do anything. Yeah I'm sorry, whose idea was it to have fucking Will and Grace on the same team? You know I've actually never seen - I don't watch - "Will and Grace". They are so cute. - I want that. - Yeah keep dreaming, Jerry. Well we can play a different game. I brought Bananagrams and Exploding Kittens, and I tried to bring Scene It: Turner Classics edition but this one confiscated it. It's not fun when you know all the answers. It's fun for me. Okay fuck all those options. I'm the hostess and I've decided that we're gonna play a grown-up game. Truth or dare. Oh dare baby, pick me, pick me, I pick dare. Zane. I dare you to strip naked and let me draw flowers all over your body. Fine. Oh wow. Go on then. Ryder, truth or dare? Dare obviously. I dare you to spank Jimmy's ass. It's Jerry. You heard the man Jimmy, get your sweet tush over here. Okay. Like that? Oh! You've been a bad, bad boy Jerry. - I have. - All those nights alone. Yeah I live alone. Yeah this is what you like, isn't it? Ow okay, that one was too hard. - AHH. - There we go. So fun. - Meg. Truth or dare? - Please. I dare you to give everyone at this party a lap dance. Oh my God yes. Alexa, play slut playlist. Yes. Oh my God. Okay. Oh. Yeah. - You like this, baby? - Yeah. - Todd, Todd is he gonna? - Oh God okay. Yup, yup, yup that's happening. Oh my God, oh my God! - Hi. - Hi. Oh, sorry I just have, an eyelash in my eye. I'm just gonna. Bye Rory. Fuck I'm horny. I think we all are. You wanna do the thing? Not that horny, Jerry. My sweater is green. My sweater is green. My skirt is beige. The walls are gray, the door is... Truth. - Have you and Rory... - I mean dare. Afraid of the truth Todd? Stand up. Just do it. I dare you to switch clothes with me. You have to play Todd. Let me. Todd? I have a headache, I think it's all that snollygoster I ate. I'm in the shower. - Can I come in? - What? In the shower can I come in? Well I have a bristle body back brush, so I can reach everywhere, It might be counterproductive. Please? I won't look I promise. Okay. - Good night. - Good night. I love you. I love you too. What are you doing? Can't you tell? Well I think so but. It should be obvious. - You shouldn't. - I know. Okay stop, stop acting. Like now or in general? You tell me. Are you getting cast? Is this routine working for you? I think you have a Trojan. Impossible I only bareback. - Trojan horse. - My nickname in college was literally Bareback Ryder. That's really unsafe. Yeah it's also a joke Todd, I read the "Iliad". The Trojan horse wasn't in the "Iliad". Okay I skimmed the "Iliad". It keeps shutting me down. What do you do on the internet? Do you really wanna know? - No. - Are you sure? You might like it. I'm sure we don't like the same things. Okay keep telling yourself that Todd. Okay you know what, you can fix this. I would if I could but. I don't know what your problem is. I thought that you said it was a Trojan. No I yes, it's a Trojan. I don't know what your problem is with me. Do you really wanna know? Yes. My problem with you Todd, is that you are trying so hard to be something that you're not and it's offensive. - Oh I offend you? - Yes you offend me. You are not bisexual Todd, and it's gays like you who can't get over their internalized homophobic shame that reinforces society's idea that actual bisexuality is a myth. Why do you even care? You're not bisexual. I've slept with bisexuals. - So? - Rory is not your girlfriend Todd. She's your fucking Katie Holmes. - Well I love her. - No you think you love her, but you are gonna break that poor girl's heart. Yeah you'd like that wouldn't you? Right because I'm the asshole in this situation. Well you are what you eat. And when you'd get to be so cleaver Todd? I've always been clever. What are you doing? Can't you tell? Well I think so but. It should be obvious. - You shouldn't. - I know. I mean I really wish you wouldn't. You should have thought of that. Is it because of what I did? Partly yes, mostly no. Stop doing that and really listen to me. You don't recognize no do you? I'm just asking you to listen. I said no. Better. That would never fucking happen! I know it's irrational, but that doesn't mean it would never happen. No it's more than irrational Todd, it's paranoia. Nobody has ever been murdered because they registered as an organ donor! I didn't say that I think I'm gonna be murdered, I said as soon as I register as an organ donor, I think I'm going to die. - Why? - Because it would be ironic. - Sure you can appreciate that. - Oh my God. Also I don't like the idea of my organs in somebody else's body, it's like when different foods touch. I need a kidney, I need a kidney and you're a perfect match. You're type O, I can't give you a kidney. You can give me a kidney. Hypothetically if you could save my life with one of your organs, would you? Hypothetically yes. Realistically? Todd just leave it. Todd. Todd. Todd! Nothing? How about now? No sorry. We could try an open relationship, if you think that would help. What if I have homosexual anxiety OCD? So I have an obsessive irrational fear of being gay but I'm actually straight. Or what if my fear of being gay has nothing to do with my OCD but I have an egodystonic sexual orientation meaning I just don't want to be gay because it conflicts with my idealized self-image, perpetuated by popular culture? Or what if I'm a heteromantic asexual? So I'm romantically attracted to women, but sexually attracted to nobody. And the thing is when I say them out loud, they all sound right but what if I'm none of the above? Do you remember what happened when your father took you to Disneyland and tried to force you onto a roller coaster? - Yes of course I was there. - What happened? I started screaming that he was kidnapping me and he almost got arrested and we never went back. You can lead a horse to water. But you can't make it get on a roller coaster or try anal sex. I get it. I'm the horse but am I a gay horse, a straight horse, or a Shetland pony? Which is basically a gay horse. That's what Ryder would say if he was here. See he's in my head! Will you please just like tell me what I am? Well why don't we just start with the basics? Are you sure you're a boy? Well I was until now. Interesting. Rory? Oh my God it is you hi! Wow this is crazy flakes. - Hi. - Nicole Shaw from Belmont High? I know, I know, I know I look totally different. Yeah. - Nose job. I got a nose job. - Oh. So wow here you are auditioning. I didn't even know you were an actress. Did you do plays in high school? No not really. - Did you? - Yeah I was in every play. Right you were yeah. So how long have you been in L.A.? Are you booking a lot? Oh well I'm actually not supposed to say anything, but I'm the new face of the Squatty Potty. Nice wow yeah, I booked two nationals this year. So it's like hell yeah no more day job! What was your day job? Oh no, I'm just being facetious. I never had one. Thank God you know? That's not really facetious. Awe you're so sweet. No I mean, how'd you pay rent? I live with my boo, and he's in banks or something so that's super convenient. And you know my parents will help me if I max out my card. They just like, they love me too much to see me suffer. People think that all we do is memorize lines, but acting is really the hardest job there is. I don't know about that. - No it is. - It's emotionally exhausting sure, but it's not like a heart transplant. If you're doing it right, it is. Hey Janice. Here's those files you wanted. Is my breath... Sorry. Is my breath that bad? How 'bout now? Better. Yeah that was great. Nicole, will you just stick around for a little bit? - Oh of course yeah. - Thank you so much. - Um... - Rory. - Rory. - Rory, Rory. That's all we need. Thank you so much for coming in today. - Okay thanks. - Yeah bye-bye. - Great job. - You're really loud. Thank you so much. Bye. I'm moving to Seattle. Well you can't be an actress in Seattle. Well apparently I can't be one here either. - Not with that attitude. - Todd, I am too smart to keep investing my life in a career and a relationship that is going nowhere. - Lucille Ball. - What about Lucille Ball? Lucille Ball didn't make it big until she was 40! - Oh my God. - I mean what if she had given up? Can you imagine that? Why are you packing? You could have your own show, - I Rove Rory. - Yeah and then you can be my heavily accented straight man. - Yeah. - No Todd. Come on. Todd, Todd if you don't want me to go, why are you packing? - I don't know! - Those aren't my clothes. I know. Todd we can do better. We both deserve more. I don't want more, I'm happy. - I'm not. - Well that's your fault not mine. Todd next week or maybe five years from now, you could meet the right guy. You could. And maybe that's someone who doesn't want to touch your butt. Or maybe you learn to like it I don't know, but I can't just sit around and wait for you to hurt me. Why would I hurt you when I love you? I don't think that you can love somebody else until you love yourself. Well I love myself when I'm with you. Todd this isn't one of our debates, you can't win. What if this is as good as it gets? Like that movie "As Good As It Gets". Sometimes something's gotta give like that movie "The Day After Tomorrow". Well can you just tell me what you want so I can try? I want my own apartment that accurately represents one third of my income, and I want my own friends that are less attractive than me, and I want simultaneous orgasms, and those are things you can't give. You said you didn't want sex. Yeah I changed my mind. Well that's not allowed. Maybe one day I want kids. Todd, hey Todd. Todd come on. Todd don't, Todd hey Todd don't, come on. Todd I'm sorry I don't want kids. I don't want kids. Todd, that was stupid. I don't know why I said that, I'm sorry. Come on. Todd. Todd. Todd I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't mean it. I hate babies. We know this. Todd, come on. Okay, okay. Todd I need you to breath, alright? Just breath for me okay? It's okay Todd, it's okay. You're gonna be... Todd I'm here okay? I'm just gonna sit right here, but I need you to breath. Alright? I'm right here, I'm just gonna be right here. People say that finding love is hard. Well I did the math. There are four million people living in Los Angeles based off the 2010 census. Approximately eight percent of whom are men aged 20 to 30, five to 10% of whom identify as gay or bisexual. Of these 32,000 or less men, only 10% will have an IQ of 120 or higher, so we can eliminate the rest let's be honest. Of the remaining 3200, I will be sexually incompatible with most of them. While there are no conclusive studies on the number of gay men who abstain from penetrative sex, I'm assuming the number is less than 25% especially in my generation and I think that's generous. Now of these 800 men, 30% will be in long-term relationships with each other, 60% will find me unattractive either because I'm Asian, because I have a crooked face, or because I'm generally incorrigible, and an additional nine percent that can actually put up with me, I will reject outright over various deal-breakers including but not limited to snoring, poor dental hygiene and or bad taste in movies. That only leaves eight potential could mates on the high end and after calculating he binomial distribution for randomly meeting any one of them on any given day over the next half century - Todd. - and integrating the probability mass from zero to one number of meetings, - Todd. - there is only a .0006% chance that I will ever fall in love which is, as I'm sure you can guess, statistically insignificant. - Todd. - And I'm having more compulsions so if you could please refer me to a cognitive behavioral therapist, I'd greatly appreciate it. Why don't you call Dr. Lionetti? I don't want him to know that I'm relapsing. He has a very high opinion of me, he said so in our last session. Have you considered that your symptoms are being activated by emotional stress? Oh you think it's psychological? Well I guess that's why my parents pay you the big bucks. I'm sorry I know I'm projecting. I'm projecting, I'm projecting, - I'm projecting. - If Rory was a man, would you still love her? What do you mean? If you met a man with all of Rory's qualities, her interests, her intellect, her sense of humor, would you consider this man your soul mate? Yes obviously. Then Todd I think you might be gay. Like a Kinsey five. Okay fine. I'm 'gay'. Is that what you wanna hear? Is that what the world needs to hear? I'm fucking gay? I don't have a problem with being gay, I have a problem with being alone for the rest of my life! Well then. I think we're making progress. I mean gay men have been marrying women since sliced bread. I don't know what to tell you. Maybe Rory's right. Maybe I don't love myself. Maybe I wouldn't have been loyal to her. Now you're just being silly. You're like the definition of loyal. You're like that dog Old Yeller. Yeah Old Yeller was loyal, until he got rabies and then Travis shot him in the face and he died. I'm cheating on Zane. - What? - I've been sleeping with his other guy. His name is River. He's beautiful, he has an accent. Zane has an accent. I know but he didn't feel foreign to me anymore. Don't lecture me, I know it's fucked. Look, Todd my point is, I love you but I can't imagine spending more than three days with you at a time. That's not a point. Zane and I aren't best friends. We don't have have doc night, we don't bananagram, we don't lose track of time via intense conversation. We do lose track of time via intense fucking, but for me that's easy to come by. You know I throw a penny, I hit a model. Can you say the same thing about Rory? Think about it. Can we go inside now? Thank you. Rory. Rory. Rory. Rory. Excuse me. Do you work here? Hi Karen, it's Rory. Just thought I'd drop you a line. Work is good, my boss wanted me to decorate my cubicle. Apparently my lack of framed photographs is darkening her aura, so I photoshopped myself into a fashion spread with the cast of "The O.C." and then she was like, "All of your friends are white." and I was like, "I know I'm sorry." Oh in 23 days I qualify for medical which is great 'cause I can't hear certain frequencies in my left ear. I think I might have like an acoustic neuroma or something. I know I sound like... and apparently I'm gonna see you seven more times before you die. I did say you were living in the Philippines, I know that's temporary but, I think it might have skewed the results. Okay call me back. Bye. I keep telling them we need to get a second toaster. These traffic jams are driving me mad. You should write up a cost-benefit analysis. When management sees this loss of employee productivity, surely they will cave to your demands. So what kind of bagel are you having? - Sesame. - Nice. What kind of bagel are you having? Garlic. Lovely. Well I'm not planing on kissing anyone today so. Are you? Am I what? Do you have plans to kiss anyone today? Nope. Nothing on the calendar. Hey you! Answer the door! It is a school night! Really? I know you're in there, you just turned the lights off. God why can't you just have sex for five minutes like a normal person? Hey Rory. Oh hey Craig. A bunch of us are gonna check out this new Thai place for lunch. It's not a party unless you're there. Yeah. Okay I like Thai. Great. We're about to head over. For sure, I'm just gonna finish this and then I'll meet you guys there. Don't work too hard Rory Gilmore. You watch "Gilmore Girls"? Oh yeah, yeah I own like all the seasons on DVD. Me too. Hey Craig, random question. Hit me. If somebody had a gun to your head and they said "Kill this baby or I'm gonna kill you", what would you do? - What baby? - There's a baby on the floor. It's just lying on the floor? Okay it's on a shelf but you have a gun, and you can either kill the baby or you get shot. Can't I just kill the guy with the gun pointed to my head? No he's too fast, he's like James Bond. Why would James Bond make me kill a baby? It's a hypothetical situation Craig. I mean I guess I would, save the baby. I don't think I could live with the guilt. Yeah. Why, what would you do? Oh I would save the baby obviously. You're so funny Rory. Excuse me. Do you work here? Todd? What are you doing here? How did you find me? Your landlord called me for a reference check, she had your employer info on file. She just gave it to you? Well her English wasn't very good. Yeah I think she's Bulgarian. I would've guessed Hungarian. What's the difference? Well Hungarians can't make the 'th' sound. - The what? - The 'th' sound. Okay nevermind Todd how did you even get to Seattle? Did you, did you take a plane? Yes. For you. - Really? - No I drove. It took me three days. I had to book a hotel in Sacramento and Medford. Look you called me. No, no I didn't. - Yes you did. - My butt, my butt dialed you. Well I think your butt knows what your heart wants. I think you called me like that episode of "Gilmore Girls" where Lorelei calls Luke like that movie "The Way We Were" where Barbra Streisand calls Robert Redford because she really needed her best friend. Todd, this is too meta for me. I'm your best friend, and I just wanna be the way we were. You know how that movie ends right? Yes and it sucked, and that's why. And that's why. Todd what is this? - It's our song. - I have never heard this song in my life. Well every rainbow - has to start somewhere. - What? Todd, how long have these people been out there? Were they one per tree? What if I didn't show up? What if I worked late or snuck out the back and carpooled to Chipotle? - I don't know. - You're crazy. People do crazy things - when they're in love. - When they're in love. Todd, Todd what are you doing? Rory I love you. - Get up, Todd! - I will always love you. And I know that you're scared that I'm going to hurt you, so I'm giving you - my guarantee. - That better not be a ring or I'm gonna... Rory will you... - What, no! - You didn't even - let me finish. - No I will not marry you! - Why? - I am not discussing... Okay. They need to leave. Whoever they are. Do you know these people? Great. Okay, hi. Excuse me I'm sorry, but this is just a big misunderstanding. You're all very talented but show's over. Okay, time to go home. All seven of you. Okay thank you. Drive safe. Todd. I'm not ready for this, this is too soon. Well are you even happy here? - Overall yes. - Oh. Well, do you love me? No. Look, I know that you're worried I'm gonna meet the perfect guy some day, but I promise you I won't because he doesn't exist. Sure we all like to think there's this soul mate out there for us who's going to complete us intellectually and physically and emotionally, but the harsh reality is not everybody gets that. So two out of three isn't so bad. I mean, if your blind or schizophrenic or you're missing an arm and a leg, you might not even get one out of three and you just have to accept that. And I know that that's an offensive thing to say, but you agree with me, you agree with me. And anyway I had accepted that, that I would never find anybody because I admit that I'm finicky, but then I met you and I don't have to scour the ends of the earth to know beyond a reasonable doubt that you're the one. I already know. You're the only person I like arguing with and you're the only person I don't mind losing to, and you're the only person I can't lose. And so maybe we won't have the greatest sex ever, but you know, I mean I can try harder. I mean if Helen Keller can learn to talk, I can learn to eat you out, and I just, I honestly think that we could be happy for the rest of our lives because I wanna watch you die. I mean, I wanna see you through to the end. In sickness, and in health and you know that that says a lot because I don't like sickness or endings or poop and you know this, but you know, if you had cancer and you needed help, I mean ideally I'll have a nurse to help deal with that, but if it was an emergency and you did number two in your pants, I would clean you up because I love you and I want you to be my wife. I'm sorry. Baby if you love me, won't you please just just give me a smile? Baby if you love me, won't you please just just give me a smile? Baby if you love me, won't you please just give me a smile? Baby if you love me, won't you please just give me a smile? Please, please give me a smile. Baby if you love me, won't you please just give me a smile? Rory come on! Baby if you love me, won't you please just give me a smile? - Sonder. - That's a great word. I didn't have a moment of sonder until last year. That's okay, you have other good qualities. - Schadenfreude obviously. - Or Jouska. What's Jouska? Jouska is when you replay a hypothetical dialogue over and over again in your head, like winning an argument, or getting interviewed by Conan O'Brien. There's a word for that? There's a word for everything. I wonder if there's a word that exactly describes the feeling when you learn there's a word that exactly describes what you're feeling. If there is, I bet it's French. What are we talking about? Specific words to describe obscure emotions. Oh. Déjà vu. We already said that. - Cauliphrenia. - What's that? Well Cauliphrenia is the feeling when you eat the last bite of something delicious and you become sad because you can no longer eat it. How do you spell that? He's lying. You're such a tattletale. Yeah you'd get shanked in prison, Todd. Oh imagine all the new things you'd get to try if you were someone's bitch. Hey Todd, remember when you were gonna learn how to eat me out? I wish there was a word to describe how I'm feeling now. You guys ready? Ready. Split.
