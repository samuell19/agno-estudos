BISHNUPUR, BANKURA GOKULNAGAR 1 KM - Mr. Madhav? - Yes. Hello, I'm Jayanta Biswas. - Hello. - Hello. Please come. This way. Follow me. - Sukumar had told me you'll be coming. - Hmm. Since it was getting late, I thought... It took a while to reach Bishnupur. Oh. Give me a minute. Take a look. I think this is the same one, sir. But it's been 30 years. Come with me. Come. This way. Please come. Right there. I'm 100% sure it's the Vishnu idol that was stolen from here. Where did you find it? In Darjeeling. At an exhibition. Anyway... Where was the attendant killed? There... The way we came in. Who is it? Who's there? Kalpana? - You? - Get lost. Go away. What are you doing here? What the-- Hello? Hello! Can you hear me? Hello... Hello? Hello, I'm-- Hello! Dear Mr. Ashok Bera... Got your mail id from your colleague. Tried to call you but couldn't connect. I have very important information for you that can change your life. DARJEELING Help! Help! Help! Where is he? Put it down here. Be careful... Hey! How much? It's 100 bucks, sir. What? You just walked down the escalator. - But it wasn't working. - So what? - Won't give you more than 80 bucks. - No... - Promotho? - No. Bapi, please pay him. I don't have change. Hello. Yes, we just got off the train. - Here you go. - Thanks. Yes... Mutton curry and fried bread you packed? I had very little. Bapi and Promotho ate the rest. You still think he's a nice guy? How can I stop them from eating? I'll call you back. Hey, Bapi! Damn it! Sir, this is mine. It says Ekendra Sen. Hey, Bapi! NEW JALPAIGURI JN. It's freezing! Are you going to Antarctica? The chilly weather of Darjeeling, sir. It gets to you. Hey, Bapi. Hmm. What's a hill's smile called? - "Hill's smile"? - Yes. "Hilllol." "Hill-L-O-L." This is just the beginning. Ready? Hmm. Why did you leave my luggage behind? Why did you tell your wife that we ate all the food? You ate most of it. Drama king! Kanchenjungha! Where? Where? - Hmm? - Where? Thinking of the films shot in Darjeeling. - Not Mount Kanchenjungha. - Oh. "Kanchenjungha", "Baksa Badal." My bag almost got exchanged... with that of a suspicious man in black jacket. - He was eyeing my bag. - Good for him! Bapi, carry on... "Kanchenjungha", "Baksa Badal" and... "Sagina Mahato." - Your turn. - Memory game? Okay. "Kanchenjungha", "Baksa Badal", "Sagina Mahato." Hmm. "Kanchenjungha", "Baksa Badal", "Sagina Mahato." - Hmm. - Hmm? - "Sagina Mahato." - You can't take so much time. Umm... "Sagina Mahato", "Tulodhona." Tell him. It's "Aradhana." Oh, yes, "Aradhana". Anyway, "Kanchenjungha", "Baksa Badal"... "Sagina Mahato", "Aradhana", "Komal Gandhar." That was shot in Kalimpong. - Back then, it was all part of Darjeeling. - Oh. Oh Mother, let me hold your feet... Please don't sing. Not happening. Huh! Mr. Know-It-All! Sir, Bapi sir? - Hmm? - Just a thought... "Mother, let me hold your feet on my chest." Doesn't work. Why? There are two possibilities. Either the boy is lying down and the mother's feet are on his chest. But if the boy is standing, then she has to put her leg up. Won't it look bad? What do you think? Incorrigible! - Hmm... - Hmm... ...On my chest... This is where I was born... Take a look at this. BODY OF DEAD YOUTH FOUND IN PINE FOREST Sir. Sir. Look! Stop the car. Hello. Hello, Manisha? Darjeeling never gets old. - True. - Hmm. This is Das Studio. Let's take a photo here. Ready? Yes. One, two, cheese. Great feat by a Bengali! - The owner isn't Bengali. - Oh. Thakurdas Pradhan set up this studio in 1927. - Really? - Yes. I think everything is Bengali. Mount Vesuvius? It's named after a Bengali. Vishu Biswas. - What rubbish! - Seriously, I mean it. I thought Vengsarkar is Bengali too. Then I heard he's Marathi. - Hey! - What the... Hey! Carrying lights around in the middle of the day. Oh, there's a shoot going on! Where? Oh wow! - There? - Yeah... Right there. - Stop! - Bipasha Mitra. - Where's she? - Right there. She's looking at you. What rubbish! What are you saying? Why will she look at me? Because you're one of a kind. Come this way. Watch your step. Excuse me, sir. - Are you Ekendra Sen? - Yes. If you don't mind... Where are you putting up? Hotel Elgin. Thank you, sir. Bipasha Mitra wanted to know. Thank you. Oh, wow! Come on! Nothing like that. She must have seen my photo in the papers after the Shantiniketan case. - Promotho... - Hmm? Did your photo ever come out in the papers? - It will come out when I kill you. - One, two, three, four. What a goon! - Hey, Bapi. - Hmm? Why did he want to know where we are staying? Stop! Stop! Stop! Maybe they want to cast you in the film. Me? Expectations lead to disappointment. Who's calling me now? Hello, Mr. Sen. This is Superintendent of Police, Darjeeling. Rajiv Gurung. I see. Hello. SP, Darjeeling. How are you? I'm fine. What about you? Are you here on vacation or to solve a case? On a holiday. Oh, good. Staying at the Elgin? Yes. Coming over. I didn't know anything. Bipasha Mitra just told me. You know, the famous Bengali film star? Yes, of course. She has a request for you. You can't turn it down. Okay. One, two, three, four. Cut! Bipasha is five feet nine inches tall in heels. Oh, she's not even five feet? Then it's fine. She's five feet nine inches. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - How are you? - I'm well. Finally, got to come over. Is Ekendra Sen here? Eken Babu. Yes, sir. - Eken Babu! - Please take a seat. - Please have a seat. - Thank you very much. - Hello. - Hello. - Hope you're well. - Yes. - My friends. Promotho... - Hello. And Bapi. They are scholars. - Hi. - Hello. And this is the SP of Darjeeling, Mr. Rajiv Gurung. And we've been... for a long time... - What do you call it? - Colleagues. Yes, we are colleagues. So, tell me. Bipasha Mitra has made a request. But I can't act. I took part in a few local plays as a kid. Please carry on. Hmm... Umm... Madam has an ancestral property here. Raj Villa. The Asian Studies had organised an exhibition here a few days ago. Vishnu idols from all over the world were exhibited. An idol from her collection was part of the exhibition. Where is it now? I don't know. The idol belonged to her father, Sujoy Mitra. He had brought it from Cambodia. It's almost 1500 years old. Then? The idol went missing when it was being returned. There's nothing in the newspaper about this. No. It's private property. And she's a huge film star. So, the news wasn't leaked. Bipasha read about you in the newspaper. So, she wanted to meet you. Raj Villa, Ladenla Road. A chance to be an acting idol. But that too ended in an idol theft. Are the sunglasses from a dead Englishman? Huh! Absolutely not! I bought it for 500 bucks. Why did you buy it? You get it for free after cataract operation. Did you mind? It's as pointless as cooking in a forest. - You mean crying. - Yeah, whatever! - What's wrong? - Every-damn-thing. We're on a holiday. But we can't enjoy ourselves. I won't take up the case. - Really? - Yes. I've worked a lot of cases like this. And the film industry has bad reputation. Would seem so. - Grapes are sour. - Don't talk. - Ekendra Sen? - Yes. - Hello. I'm Bubun Kar. - Hmm. - I'm Bipasha's secretary and PA. - Oh. I've read all your cases. The Shantiniketan Case... And the Barman Family Mystery. That's my favourite. - Bapi, right? - Yes. Hello. - And you must be... Correct. - Promotho. - Please come in. - Let's go. The SP was talking about an idol. Yes, a Vishnu idol from Cambodia. Madam is quite worried since the idol vanished. It was bubble-wrapped and put in a wooden crate from the gallery. When the crate was opened, the idol wasn't there. Vanished! - I'll let madam know you're here. - Okay. - Bapi, is it real? - What are you doing? Good morning. - Call Maria. - Yes, madam. Please sit. Take a seat. Thanks for coming. No problem, sir. I meant madam. It's my pleasure. You can call me Bipasha. Okay, ma-- Bipasha... Ma'am... Okay. - This is Professor Bappaditya Dasgupta. - Hello. - And this is Promotho. - Hello. He's a researcher in Chicago University. I can't function without them. Eken Babu... Whatever I'm going to tell you is strictly confidential. It's about the Vishnu idol, right? That's not why I wanted to meet you. The Vishnu idol wasn't stolen. It's lost. An old photograph is missing for a few days. I can't even inform the police. It's tough being a celebrity. Everything turns into news. What's in the photo? Umm... My grandfather's father, Late Ajoy Mitra and Tripura's King Vijaya Manikya. They used to be very good friends. It's a photo of them in America. The king had sent that photo to my great grandpa before his death. He even wrote something on the back. "It's my last gift and the photograph is very precious." It was in an envelope. But it's not there now. You have to find the photo for me. Madam... It won't be possible. I'm here on holiday and will go home soon. You should ask the police for help. Isn't it, Bapi? Yes. Won't you help me? Even if I ask you, you won't? It's my request, Eken. Please. How long has the photo been missing? So nice of you. Last week. Come with me. Take it off. Hmm. The photo used to be in this album along with the envelope. Both the envelope and the photo are gone now. Wasn't it locked? No. No one comes in this room. Do you suspect anyone who's been here in the last one week? In the past week... Please keep the name to yourselves. Yes, of course. Debraj Singh. The owner of the New Heritage Hotel chain. He's a close friend. He comes here quite often. He was here last week as well. - Apart from that-- - Keep it on the table. Takes so long to make some tea? They've been here for a while. Put it down. That's enough. Leave. - Sorry, ma'am. - It's okay. Go on. Please take a seat. You? Sugar? Me? But how do you know? My photo doesn't come out in papers. No sugar for him. Oh. Just a second. Why is the photograph so valuable? I don't know. Thank you. But there were some unusual symbols in red ink on the back of the envelope. And Grandpa had asked me to keep the photo safe. He told me it's very precious. Eken... I know it's a tough case but you can name your price. You must find the photo for me. Please. Thank you. I'll take a teaspoon. Don't cry. You know how she is. She says whatever she wants. If you take it seriously... One moment. I'll be right there. Go inside. I'll deal with them. - Leaving? - Yes, sir. - Please don't call me sir. - He calls everyone sir. Oh, I see. - Let me show you out. - Okay. - Please come. - Let's go. Well, Mr. Sen... Please don't start working without an advance. You saw how she behaves, right? I'd asked for some money for my mom's treatment... Anyway... Remember my advice. Or all your efforts might be in vain. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. "I don't have the time, madam." "Won't you help me, Eken? Even if I ask you? Please..." Disgusting! You're such a turncoat. How could I refuse a lady like that? Let's have some lemon tea. Tea can wait. You need to do your homework on Bipasha first. Bipasha's great grandfather is Ajoy Mitra. He married a German lady. Bijoy Mitra was their son. Sujoy Mitra is Bijoy's son. He married an Irish lady. And Bipasha is their daughter. Her parents are dead. She manages the entire estate. She's very rich. Sujoy Mitra used to collect antiques. They have an ancestral house in Darjeeling called Raj Villa. He used to be a patron of the Asian Studies. You'll get rest of the info on the internet. And you'll get all the gossip too. Hmm. Lemon tea. Hey, one lemon tea-- You? - Yes. - Three cups of lemon tea. - Bapi? - Hmm. "My heart counts the pines away..." There are so many pine trees. Why was the poet counting? What does the song have to do with pines? - Pine tree? - He meant the heart was pining. That's how poets write. Oh. Why is the photograph so valuable? - Maybe a clue. - Maybe a stamp. Let's say... The stamp on the envelope the king sent might have been valuable. People buy stamps worth million dollars. Isn't it? Both of you are my "blind man's pain". No. - Do you do it on purpose? - What? It's "blind man's cane". Why make things up? - Why would I? - Of course. That's who you are. - Now buy us lunch at Glenary's. - But my tea... - Let's go. - My tea... - My tea will spill. - Come on. Bapi, please pay him. Let's go. How much? You call me a glutton. What about you? - You are such a cheapskate. - Whatever! What do you want for lunch? Let's have sizzlers. - Why not? - Okay, great. And we'll have a pizza too. - Okay. - And dessert. - Eken Babu? - What happened? - Where are you going? - Eken Babu? Eken Babu, what's wrong? Eken Babu! Sureta. Ashok told you, didn't he? Please leave me alone. He called you, right? Ashok had hit the jackpot, Sureta. That's why he was killed. - Bapi. - What happened? The tap is not working. One for shower. The other one for tap. There's only cold water. Please check. Must be housekeeping. Open the door. Uff! Yes? - Ekendra Sen? - Yes... Yes... Sir, only cold water running in the taps. Please take a look. I'm Debraj Singh. Oh gosh. Sorry. Give me a minute. I'll be right back. Please come in. Sit. Sorry, sir. Actually, there are two taps but no hot water. Let it be for now. - Some tea or coffee? - No, thanks. Bipasha told me that you're staying here. So I thought I should visit. Actually, I need your help too. That's the reason. What kind of a watch is this? It's a smart watch. It's from We3. I'm a little health conscious. How's the watch related to health? With a smart watch and its app on your phone... all your physical activities will be synced to your phone. It'll track your steps and calories. Is this a watch or a watch dog? That was a good one. - Please go ahead. - Right. I run a small business by the grace of the Goddess. A chain of hotels. - The New Heritage? - Did Bipasha tell you? - Yes. - I see. There's a place called Lepchajagat nearby. An assistant manager in my Darjeeling New Heritage Hotel... Ashok Bera was murdered there last night. Right... I read about it in a newspaper I think. He was a gentleman, you know. He didn't have any bad habits. He didn't keep bad company. We can't figure out who could've killed him. Isn't Darjeeling Police investigating the case? They are but... But he was my staff. And I have a responsibility towards my staff. It's also about my hotel's reputation. I've heard a lot about you. If you take up this case... I'm caught up with another case. - The Vishnu statue? - Yes. Oh. If you want... I can talk to Bipasha. No, you don't need to do that. Let me see what I can do. If I can talk to the other hotel staff... Ashok's colleagues... Fantastic! Come down in the evening. Aditya will be there. And my assistant manager, Indra Roy, will be there too. - He'll introduce you to everyone. - Okay. - Token. - You didn't have to... It's my principle. You're spending your valuable time. And I want to value your time. Please... Thank you. Sir? How was he killed? Hmm... He was shot from a close range... by one or more perpetrators. And the time of occurrence? I don't know. But the police were asking me about my whereabouts between 8 and 10 p.m. - It must have been around that time. - So where were you? - What? - Sorry, sir. Where were you? No, it's okay. I was at Bipasha's. We had dinner. Then we discussed a project. I got back home around 1:30 a.m. We are working on a joint project. Yes, I read it on a news portal. Hotels? Yes. Here is my card. Call me if you need anything. Hmm. Ashok looked a lot like you. So when I saw you at the door... - Please don't mind. - It's okay. Okay, gentlemen. Have a good day. See you. Let me see that. "Only cold water running in the taps." So embarrassing! Hail Miser Sen! But, sir... Bipasha thinks he's the prime suspect. Then why send him to us? Oh come on! Why are you overthinking? Earn money with both hands. Use your left brain for Bipasha. And the right one for Debraj. One client will pay for the Elgin. And the other one will pay for food... Take the token for granted. Yeah, right! I'll work hard and you'll have fun. Are you insane? What are you talking about? I know what I'm talking about. Just remember what I told you. Choice is yours. - What the hell! - Bye. Oh my gosh! It's freezing! - Oh gosh. - We're here. - Hello, sir. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. - I'm Indra Roy. - Who? Oh, yes. I'm Ekendra Sen. And my friends, Bapi and Promotho. - Hello. - Hello. Sir had told us you'll visit. - Please come in. - Yes. I need some information about Ashok. What do you want to know? Did he have any enemies? Someone who could kill him. No, sir. We were room mates for the last five years. Don't think he had any enemies. Any threat calls? Not that I know of. But, yes... A man came by in the morning asking about him. Indra, I will smack him now. He has been fooling around and not doing his work. - Excuse me. - Yes, sir. Mr. Ashok Bera? Calm down. Indra. Indra? Wait. - Yes, sir. - Mr. Ashok Bera. Well... Very sorry, sir. He died last night. Murdered. What's the name of that man? Sir, we didn't ask him. Sorry. Tell me... - How was Ashok as a person? - A very nice man, sir. He was very helpful. He wanted to start an orphanage in Kurseong recently. He always felt very deeply for orphans. Oh. Was he an orphan? No, his parents are still alive. Did he have a lot of money on him? Maybe someone wanted to loot the money? No, he never used to keep a lot of money on him. We used to return home together. Our dorm is near Darjeeling station. I paid the fare most of the time. He paid me back when we got home. Oh. Last night was the same? No, sir. Thursdays are my day off. I was at the dorm. He left the hotel around 7 p.m. - Sir, please. - Hmm. - Thank you. - Welcome. Thank you. Here it is. - So nice of you, ma'am. - It's okay. Promotho? You wanted chicken "patties" from me. Here you go. Don't you have any other questions? Right. I wanted to confirm something. Is this a chicken "patties"? - Yes, sir. - Okay. Nope. Well... - The murder happened between 8 and 10 pm. - Yes. - Where were you at that time? - At the dorm. We used to stay there together. We used to play cards on Thursdays. - Did you play cards yesterday? - Yes. For how long? Till around 8:30 p.m. Hmm. Then the police informed me in the morning. Indra... Ashok didn't get back to the dorm all night. Didn't you call him? I did. But couldn't get through to his phone. Thought he has gone to Kurseong. Will be back in the morning. - But then... - It's gone cold. What? The coffee. No problem. I'll have it anyway. After all, it's Darjeeling coffee. Who else joins you to play cards? Aditya Das. Shekhar from Accounts and Jimmy. They stay in the same dorm. Was Ashok worried about something? He just had one concern. He needed money to start the orphanage. Around four lakhs. Debraj had agreed to give it to him. Did he have any friends or relatives? No. He wasn't very friendly. He got a few calls from home. And he was in a relationship with our former colleague. She used to call him. What's her name? Ms. Sureta Tamang. Now she is the housekeeper at the Elgin. We're also staying at the Elgin-- Oh, okay. Do you remember... anything else that's important? Yes. I received a call last night on the landline. Because Ashok wasn't reachable on his mobile. Hello. Hello. Hello. Can I speak to Ashok Bera? No, he isn't back yet. Hello. Hello. Who is this? This is Jayanta. Can I take a message? Can I get his mail id? He has an official mail id. Note it down. Hello. A-s-h-o-k... Hello. Hello. Yes, tell me. This way... Okay. By the way... We'll go to your dorm tomorrow. Sure, sir. - Aditya, come here. - Hmm. - What happened? - This is Ekendra Sen. Detective. He's looking into Ashok's-- So? Where were you between 8 and 10 p.m. on the night of the murder? I was alive. I can see that. But where? I was in Kalimpong. I don't like talking unnecessarily. Sorry, sir. - He's a little irritable. - It's okay. - I'm used to it. Good night. - Good night, sir. - Good night. - Let's go. The chicken "patties" was great. - It's not "patties", it's patty. - There were many. So plural. Unbelievable! Why do you attack food like that? My brain doesn't work unless my belly is full. Drama king! Yes, Manisha. Come. She's Manisha Chhetri. Her research is on Anthropology. - Hello. - Manisha, he's Mr. Ekendra Sen. The SP has sent him. Did you pack the Vishnu idol, Pradip? Yes, but it just vanished. Didn't anybody make a fuss about it? Most people don't know about it. The idol was already in the news by then. Why? There was a controversy that the idol wasn't from Cambodia. Sujoy Mitra and Bipasha had told us it's from Cambodia. And it's 1500 years old. But a professor named Jayanta Biswas... created an issue about this at the exhibition. What are you saying? - Are you sure? - Yes, 100 percent. No, you're absolutely mistaken, sir. May I know who you are? I'm Jayanta Biswas. I teach History at the Michigan University. I see. Are you sure, sir, that this idol is from Cambodia? We have provenance. Then I'm sorry to say but I just beg to differ. You've made up the Cambodia story. The Cambodia story is fake. It's all fake. I'll prove it to you that this is a stolen idol. It was stolen from Pancharatna Temple in Bankura 30 years ago. You're misguiding people with wrong information. And intentionally. How dare you? What's provenance? It means the place of origin of an item and its history. - Suppose this table. - What's wrong with the table? The film "Kanchenjungha" was shot here. Anil Chatterjee was here and Satyajit Ray was behind the camera. Just imagine. - It was this table? - Yes. - Huh? - Hmm. I have goosebumps. I can't even wear my coat any more. My uncle had a table that everyone stayed away from. - Why? - It was the periodic table. - You were thinking. - I was thinking... Will two plates of chicken sausages be enough for us? What about the investigation? Wondering if it's the same Jayanta, Indra was talking about. Why will a History professor call Ashok Bera? - Bapi. - Yes. - This is yours. - Yes, okay. Chicken "Lyangcha"! - Here's the sauce. - Will you have the egg, Bapi? Why do you always take his food? Have the sausages. Good news for you. We got a customer for your stamp. Habeeb Mullick. Under the Chalet Hotel's wing. What? - Hey? - Yes. Where's Habeeb Mullick? Under the Chalet Hotel's wing at the Mall. Come on. Let's go. What's the matter? Sir. Remember Debraj Singh said Ashok looks like you. - Yes. - Right? He mistook you for Ashok. - That means... - Ashok had been to the stamp store. Let's go. - Why did the man say that? - What? What did he mean by under the hotel's wing? He meant beside the hotel. Is that so? Oh, so right now you're under my wings? - Habeeb Mullick. - There it is. - Hello. - Hello. Do you buy stamps? - Of course. - Yes? But sir, you said they don't buy stamps if they don't get customers. Huh? If it's costly then we look for customers. Otherwise we take it. Okay. This man here... Him... No, his friend had come here with a stamp... It was very valuable. So you'd said you can't buy it unless you get a customer. - Who is it? - Ashok Bera? Ashok Bera? Oh, yes. Right. He had a Scinde Dawk stamp in his collection. It was beautiful. Is he your friend? His friend. - I see. - Yes, friend. Prema, bring me the phone number. - Look at that. - Give it to me. Here. Mr. Bera gave me this number. But the number is out of service. Do you have any other number? No, he used only this one. Right? No, I don't have any other number. Did he only bring the stamp or also an envelope? - Was there an envelope? - Yes. Lozenge cancelled half-anna Scinde Dawk stamp. Oh, I see. How much was it worth? Price? Not less than 15 lakhs. Thank you. - What's the matter? - Hmm? - The shopkeeper didn't recognise you. - So what? Something is definitely wrong. His number doesn't exist. Naturally. Because the man doesn't exist. I think Bapi is right. It's not the photo. It's the stamp which is valuable. - How did Ashok Bera get it? - He stole it from Bipasha's house. But what was the assistant manager of New Heritage doing at Bipasha's house? Wait a minute. Then the murder... - Did someone find out? - That he has the Scinde Dawk stamp? Wow! Good company has brought you "winter". Please stop it. Otherwise, we'll be be ruined. It's actually a "Sindhu Dak" stamp. Oh my God! The postal system of the Sindh province operated by runners. - Take a look at this. - Hmm. The British called it "Scinde Dawk". - "Scinde Dawk?" Okay. - "Scinde Dawk." First adhesive postage stamp. - British East India Company. - Wonderful! - What's "candy cancel"? - Lozenge cancelled. - Yes, that one. - Here you go. - Look at this design. - Hmm. They print this design to cancel stamps. Scinde Dawk was also cancelled like this. - Scinde Dawk - Oh. That's why it's so valuable. Oh damn! - Eken Babu. - Eken Babu. - What happened? - What is it? Eken Babu, where are you going? - Hey, wait. - Eken Babu? Where's the money? Good. Put the bag down and step back. - Did you inform Bipasha Mitra? - Yes, sir. - And Bubun's family? - I tried calling them. But nobody answered. Send the body to Forensics... When did you discover the body, sir? - Just half an hour ago. - Hmm. - Excuse me, Mr. Sen. - Yes. I've sent his phone to the Forensics to retrieve data. Okay, sir. Sir... Please do this for me. Bipasha Mitra, Debraj Singh, Aditya Das and Indra Roy. Let me know their phone location history for the last few days. - Okay. - Uh...One more thing... Please check if this is Ashok's phone number. Okay. Debraj and Bipasha, according to phone records were at Raj Villa till 1:30 a.m. on the night of Ashok's murder. I see. I'll give you the rest of the information by evening. Okay. - You're going back to the hotel, right? - Uh... No, Raj Villa. Raj Villa? Okay, I'll arrange something for you. Get a car to take them to Raj Villa. Okay, sir. Please come. Did Bubun kill himself or... I still don't know... Do you think he could have died by suicide? No. He was absolutely fine. Madam... Do you know Ashok Bera? No, she doesn't know him. She has seen him once. - Who is Ashok? - The guy who got killed. - He worked in my hotel. - Oh. What happened to him? I can talk about it in front of Debraj now. Ashok is the one who stole your photo. Which photo? An old photo of my family... missing. - Then? - Wait a minute. Are you sure? I know my staff very well. Ashok was a good guy. I'm sure. But I can't figure out... What was Ashok Bera doing in your house? He was here because of me. Last week, Bipasha threw a party. It was for a shoot team from Mumbai. Yeah, it was a small but glamorous party. Yeah... New Heritage had organised the party. And Ashok was in charge. I see. That means... While arranging for the party... Ashok somehow sneaked into your room. He stole the photo with the envelope from your cupboard. Was the photo valuable? The photograph wasn't. But there was a stamp on the envelope. - That was valuable. - Okay. Lozenge cancelled Scinde Dawk stamp. Hmm. It's worth at least 15 lakhs. Ashok had gone to Habeeb Mullick's shop to sell the stamp. But he couldn't find a buyer. He left his phone number with them. Even before the shopkeeper could call him he was murdered. I think someone must have seen the stamp when he was showing it to the shopkeeper. Or he might have told someone about the stamp. So where is the stamp now? Who has it? That's what we have to find out. But there's a hitch. What? The day Ashok was murdered... a man named Jayanta tried to contact him on the phone. And took his official mail id. Is there a way to access it? Yes, the passwords are saved in an official database. - I have the access. - Can we see the email? Sure. - Jayanta? - Yes, on the 22nd. On the 22nd... Umm... No. There are no emails from Jayanta. Hmm. But why did Ashok steal it? That can be because, sir... Ashok was going to start an orphanage. Maybe he needed money for that. Or maybe he had some other reason. What I can't figure out is... How can someone who hasn't been here before... know about the photo and where it's kept? Eken Babu... - I'll get going now. - Okay. Let's go. Don't you have any manners? That juice was for her. Why did you drink it? Hello. Where are you? Be careful. What? Can you meet me? No, I'll be late. I'm at the pub. Mr. Sen will meet you soon. Who? Eken Sen. Who's that? Detective. Oh damn! That guy... Hmm. Debraj has hired a detective to spy on me? Why are you getting worked up? Why shouldn't I? Bloody swine! He might come to our dorm tomorrow. You have the room keys. Show him your room. And yours? I won't let him in my room. Clear? But what did I-- I'll disappear. Hello, wait-- Hello. What money? The gambling money? I told you I'll pay you back. No, no, no. Victor, listen to me... No, hear me out first. Now? Where? Okay, I'm coming. I'm on my way. Stop shouting! Scoundrel! Waiter. - Victor? - Who is it? Hey, Victor. Victor? Wait a minute. I'll call him. Hey, man. - Did you bring the money? - I'll pay you back- - Give me a week. - No more excuses. - Don't want to hear it. - I'll pay you back... - I've given you enough time. - I told you I'll pay you back. - I'm done with you. - I'll give it back... - I don't want to hear anything. - I promise, I'll give it back. - You're a good friend. - Come on, now. - To hell with our friendship! - Please... - Did you photograph those people? - What else? Look at this. - What's that? - I took a photo. - It's bad. - You don't know anything. His photos are better. Hello, sir. - This way. Please come. - Let's go. - The rain has made it more chilly. - Yes. This way. Please come, sir. Come in. Please. Can I get you some tea? Yes. By the way, this is Ashok's bed. That's his bedside table and there's his cupboard. - Okay? - Hmm. - Sir? - Yes? Did Ashok organise a party at Bipasha's house? Yes. Sugar? None for me. One teaspoon for them. Okay. - So you knew Bubun Kar too, right? - Yes. What a disaster! Right. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes? Do you think Bubun died by suicide? Who knows! Bubun gave him all the connections for the party. He's from Midnapore. Ashok knew him well too. - How well? - Quite well. They used to go on treks together during holidays. Hmm. Where's Aditya Das? I don't know. He told me to show you his room. Want to take a look? No, let it be. Messed everything up. STORIES OF BYOMKESH Here you go. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Sir? - Yes? Where was Aditya on the night Ashok was murdered? Most probably in Kalimpong. Did Ashok play poker? Aditya wanted him to join. Aditya gave this book to Ashok. He's addicted to poker. Aditya used to force us to play. But you have to place bets to play poker. No, we'd place very small bets. Still...it's gambling. Sir... When gambling, one incurs debt, right? Did Ashok have any debt? No. He hardly gambled. Which one is Aditya's room? This one. Shekhar and Aditya share the room. I see. - Sir. - Hmm? Did Ashok ever show you a photo? - You know, a photo. - Photo? - A stamp? - Or an envelope? - Envelope? - Hmm. No, never. Never? Never. Okay. Then, we'll get going. - Let's go. - Can I keep it here? Let's go. - Bye. - Bye. Were you at Raj Villa on the night of the party? Yes, I was serving drinks. Oh. Did you see Ashok going upstairs? - No. - No... - Okay, bye. - Bye. See you. Bye. - The sun is out again. - Hmm. - What's a hot dog? - You're eating it. What... What's an "agratin"? Chicken "agratin"? Au Gratin. It's a continental dish. - Do you want it? - No. What about this? What's fish a-la-ki... Sounds like an epic! Fish ala kiev. Chicken "au gratin", fish "ala kiev"... Let's order for the same thing again. - Excuse me. - Yes, sir. One Chicken Au Gratin. One boiled chicken with veggies and one chicken roast. Thank you. Stop being greedy. You're on a case. I can't understand anything. - Why? - Well... How could Ashok know about Bipasha's stamp? - What are you doing? - Sorry. Such a kid! Disgusting! Let me wipe your hands. What if Bubun told him? Hmm! What happened? Rupal would've been happy to know this. What? Stop pulling my leg and come to the point. - Could Bubun have done this or not? - He could have. Right, he could have. I think Bubun was murdered. Stop licking sauce off your hands and try to find out. Who's calling me now? Hello. Yes, Indra. Yes, tell me. Hello. Hello? - Sir. - Sir. Long live India! Please sit. - Red one is Debraj's phone location. - Hmm. - The green one is Bipasha's. - Okay. Ashok's is marked in yellow. And Aditya Das is marked by blue. On the night of Ashok's murder... Bipasha and Debraj were together between 8 and 10 p.m. Debraj left for his house at around 1:30 a.m. Hmm. Ashok was going towards Ghoom but suddenly turned towards Takdah. - His phone was switched off after that. - Okay. He was killed in Takdah but his body was disposed off at Lepchajagat. It's possible, sir. Aditya was not in Kalimpong that night. He was here. He was near Panwari Basti. His phone was also switched off here. Ashok Bera's call log shows... he received a few calls from the same number but didn't answer it. Some Jayanta Biswas from Bankura. Okay. - Is this Chowk Bazaar? - Yes, right there. Hello. -It's good. What do you say? -Hmm. Hmm. It's nice. I see. - Sir. - Hmm? The night Ashok was murdered... he got a call from Bankura. From Professor Jayanta Biswas. He was also killed that night. Mr. Sen? Where does it disappear? Yes, tell me. I didn't tell you this the other day. After breaking up with Sureta... her brother had threatened to kill Ashok. The night Ashok was murdered, we were playing cards. Ashok had called around 8:30 p.m. Hello. Indra, I've got great news. Great news, bro. I've hit the jackpot! What do you mean? I'll tell you when I'm back home. I don't think I have to work anymore. Okay... I'm hanging up now. - What did he mean by jackpot? - He never got to tell me. This is why I had called you. But couldn't get through. Okay then. Hmm. Indra... Does he remind you of someone? Who are you talking about? Let it be. You can go. Jackpot is that stamp. Fifteen lakhs. Yes, sir. Oh. Thank you. The number which Ashok gave to the shopkeeper doesn't exist. - Where are you off to? - Where are you going? Ranjit Mallik. - Habeeb Mullick. - Oh. Mr. Shopkeeper. Sir? Can you call the helper who works at your shop? I have good news for you, sir. We've got a buyer for your stamp. Employee? He wears a cross around his neck. He's tall. - Employee? - We don't have any employees. My wife and I run this shop. Let's go. Why did you call Bipasha here? - Eken Babu? - Hmm? Why did you call Bipasha? - There. - Yeah. Over there. You go ahead. I'll place the order. - Ma'am, can I click a selfie with you? - Sure. - Please come. - Yes. Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you, ma'am. - My pleasure. Welcome. It was urgent so had to call you. Please don't mind. It's alright. Please sit. What will you have? No, please. Let us do the favour. I've already ordered for all of us. Tell me, Mr. Sen. Well... What did you order for? Eken Babu. I won't have that Chicken Au Gratin again. - What? - Let's get back to the discussion. Okay. Ashok never went to sell the stamp. Oh. He might have stolen the stamp. But he was killed before he could sell it. Mr. Sen, please elaborate. Yes, madam. Ashok, most probably, got to know about your stamp from Bubun. Then he stole it on the night of the party. He might have told someone about the stamp. That person might have killed Ashok. And then went to sell the stamp pretending to be Ashok. It wasn't sold because there was no buyer. So, he left a fake phone number. - It wasn't Ashok's number. - Fake number? - Whose number is it? - That number doesn't exist. It's weird. Why did he give a wrong phone number? That's the confusion, madam. I think someone else is behind this. Ashok had told someone else about the stamp too. Bubun knew because they were friends. I think after Ashok got killed... Bubun guessed who the murderer was... and started blackmailing him. So Bubun got killed. Do you suspect anyone? I can only guess. Aditya Das. He also works at your hotel. His phone location does not support his claim. And it's really bad to have a false alibi. - That means Aditya took the stamp-- - From Ashok. Right, sir. He's missing since morning. The cops are looking for him. Oh my God! He has quite a reputation. Last year, he was caught in Mirik for running an underground gambling circle. Oh! So he had the chance and the motive. Let's keep the rest-- Fire! You're such an embarrassment. I've never seen food make such a loud entrance. Where are you getting stuck, Eken Babu? Something is off, sir. Why? Ashok didn't go to sell the stamp. It's confirmed. Because when we went to the shop - ...the shopkeeper didn't recognise Bapi. - Right. But someone mistook Bapi for Ashok at Keventer's. He was lying. He said they don't have any employees. The whole thing is fake. Exactly. What's going on? There's some confusion. - Can't understand anything. - I'm very confused. It's confusing. Eken Babu, are you also-- - Where did he go? - Eken Babu? Eken Babu! Eken Babu! - Eken Babu! - Where did he go? Excuse me. Please stop. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - How can I help you? - Sir. The Vishnu idol was from Bankura and not from Cambodia. You knew that from the very beginning. What? Sir. You're such an experienced man... One squeeze and you'd know. Rubbish! How does one squeeze to know? Huh? That's why he got mad? But I talk like this. I started digging into it because of the controversy. Bankura's Pancharatna Temple. An idol was stolen from there almost 30 years ago. Professor Biswas knew about it. An attendant was also killed by the robbers. And Kalpana, the daughter of the priest, was arrested for the crime. The idol was never found. But Sujoy Mitra claimed that he had brought it from Cambodia in 1990. One more thing, sir. The form of idol in Cambodia is different from that of Bankura. Just a minute. Sir. This article was published in "Arts and History" magazine in 1990. Sujoy was in Bankura at the time. That's right. A 1500-year-old idol... That's lost. But nobody is looking for it. Why? It was a stolen idol... Was the professor murdered because he knew that? And here, the stamp is stolen. Ashok is murdered. Bubun fell off the cliff. I don't like it. It's a twisted case. Madam. Yes? Ashok was a nice man. But... He suddenly changed. He kept saying... that it won't be possible for us to get married. "Let's end it." He said my family was great. That he doesn't fit in. Why? He had met my family. Even the neighbours knew... that we're getting married. All of a sudden... he cut off all relations. Did you have a fight or a difference of opinion? Not at all. We belong to the Tibetan culture. He is... He was from... Bankura. Was that why... No. Language... Lifestyle... Cultural difference... These weren't issues at all. Anyway, it's all over now. Was that the last time you spoke to Ashok? The evening he was murdered... He had called at around 8:45 p.m. Hello, Sureta. This is Ashok. Hello? Hey, I'll tell you everything. I hit the jackpot! We can try it out. Nothing can stop me from marrying you. I'll tell you everything when we meet. I'm on my way. Ashok... Did he say he has no problem marrying you or that there's no problem in you two getting married? He had said... No problem in marrying me. Just a minute. Sorry. Eken Babu? - What now? - Let's go! Here it is. Get in. Hurry up! Please come. Locker number 14. Ashok Bera's locker. Unlock it. - Open it. - Sir. This is locker number 60. It belongs to Aditya Das. Do you have a duplicate key? - Do we? - Yes, sir. Get it. Who got you? My wife! Huh? Who sent you? The SP? No. Don't know his name. Man in black shades and black coat. - You're Ekendra Sen, right? - Yes. - Where are we going? - Panwari Basti. Damn! Here you go. Shut the door. Turn the car around. He's dead. No, sir. Aditya Das has expired in a road accident. Mr. Sen is here with me. Yes, sir. I'll ask the police to get the body... Right, sir. Jiten Ghosh. If I'm not wrong, you're from Bankura Police. Bankura Police, DS. CID. Investigating Officer for the Jayanta Biswas murder case. And the monk in disguise. How did you know? You were outside the stamp shop in lama disguise but you forgot to take the holy thread off your wrist, sir. Right! So... - With Aditya's death... - The mystery deepens.... The plot thickens. I see. The envelope was recovered from Aditya's locker. Yes. And remember what I told you? That's exactly why, sir. I'm sure you'll make it possible. You already have the phone number. Right, sir? Okay. Bubun Kar's postmortem is clear. It was the fall that killed him. He was not drunk. - Bapi... - Yeah? - Look at the fog and the fine trees! - Pine. Pine. Yes, but aren't they fine too? But the case is not solved. Why? Because Aditya did not kill Ashok. What! Then why was he on the run? And the stamp was recovered from his locker too. How would I know? So annoying! One wrong move and the entire plan will fail. Like finding a snake while digging for a worm. You mean we'll have to start all over again. Oh yeah, sorry. Can I say something? Go ahead, sir. You know about the incident at the Bankura temple. Yes. The idol was stolen from the temple... The priest's daughter, Kalpana, killed the attendant... Then the robbers escaped with the idol. - Right? - Right. Kalpana was sentenced for life. But she was pregnant at the time. As long as she lived... Kalpana never revealed the name of the culprit, her lover. The high priest of the robbery? Yes. He lived in Bishnupur under the guise of research. That's where he and Kalpana grew close. Then he stole the idol. He was absconding and couldn't be traced. But yes... I've heard he belonged to a highly respectable family. And he had written papers on sculptures. Splendid! After that? While in jail, Kalpana gave birth to a boy. He was adopted by the warden of the jail. Tell me, sir... What was the name of the jailer who had adopted the boy? Sukumar Bera. Disgusting! What a fool! I am a fool! I'm talking about myself. Kalpana's son was Ashok Bera. This is what Jayanta Biswas wanted to tell Ashok. No. Not wanted to. He did tell him. After Jayanta was killed in Hotel Pancharatna I accessed his mail. This is the last mail. It was sent a good few hours before Ashok was murdered. "Dear Mr. Ashok Bera... Got your mail id from your colleague. Tried to call you but could not connect." I have very important information for you... that can change your life. The fascinating fact surfaced a few hours ago. The fact that you had been adopted by the then jailer Sukumar Bera and Mrs. Bera, is known to you. What you don't know, sir... is that your father is the late Sujoy Mitra of Darjeeling Raj Villa... and your mother is Kalpana. At the time of her death... Kalpana told Sukumar Bera everything. Jackpot. Right, sir. This is the jackpot. Sujoy Mitra's illegitimate son was Ashok Bera. That means he was Bipasha Mitra's step brother. This gave him right over half of Raj Villa. He could spend his life comfortably. Ashok had shared this with... Indra Roy... Bubun Kar... and Sureta. Ashok probably felt early on that he wasn't Sukumar Bera's son. That's why... he had a soft spot for orphans. And his frustration led to his separation with Sureta. But when he came to know who his real father was... he let Sureta know that he has no problem marrying her anymore. But who murdered him? Sir... Who stands to lose most if half their property is taken away? Bipasha. But at the time of the murder both Bipasha and Debraj Singh were at Raj Villa. According to the police. Hmm, that's true. But they don't know Bappaditya Dasgupta! What happened? Sir, it's you who solved this case. Are you done? Now drop the act and explain what's going on. - Tell us. - All in good time. - Patience-- - They've left for Bagdogra. Hurry up! Yes? From where? Oh, towards Kurseong? Kurseong, sir. I think they're headed for Pankhabari. Right. Their phone locations, sir? Okay. Where? Oh, Gumti Basti? Thank you, sir. - Do you know where Gumti Basti is? - Yes, I know. If he's good, I'm better! We have a similar saying. "I'm so much better that you should take a branch out of my book." Leaf. Yeah, yeah. It's the tree that matters. Someone please kill me! Hmmph! Please drive faster. Yes, sir. That's Debraj's car. That's their car. Plate number 9-9-0-0. Follow them. - Hurry! - Darjeeling Dynamite! Drive faster. Take the next right. Hurry! This way... Careful! Sir! You should have kept a better watch, sir. Ashok was late Sujoy Mitra's illegitimate son. And this information is the jackpot. Jayanta Biswas confirmed it in his e-mail. And Bipasha found out. How? Sir! You guys know it all and still make me say it, huh? Wait, wait, wait. Ashok Bera's e-mail could be accessed... by Debraj Singh. Right, sir. Ashok received Jayanta's e-mail. Yeah? Ashok read it, of course. But Debraj also read it and showed it to Bipasha. Then Debraj deleted it. But that e-mail was still there in Jayanta's mailbox. Jiten informed me... that Bankura's Hotel Pancharatna now has a new owner. And Debraj Singh is the new owner. So, it was no big deal for him to kill Jayanta in his own hotel. But why did Debraj get into this whole fiasco? It's Bipasha's property. Sir... Debraj Singh and Bipasha Mitra... already own a hotel of chains... What's it called? Chain of hotels. - Yes, they own a chain of hotels. - Right. If suddenly someone demands half of that property... he becomes "a path in their thorn". What? What's so funny... Let the proverbs be. Just continue. Okay, okay. On the night of the murder... Debraj left his phone with Bipasha and went out to murder Ashok. That way his phone location would not be tracked. Most probably, he knew that Aditya was headed for Takdah. That would direct suspicion towards Aditya. Right? Possibly, he left with Ashok in his car. And on the way, Ashok must have confirmed... that he is Sujoy Mitra's illegitimate son. Sorry, Ashok. It's too late. Please don't do this. I won't tell any-- By the time we arrived in Darjeeling Ashok was already dead. When Bipasha suddenly saw me here... she got frightened. She thought I might help the police solve this case. So, she came up with a plan with Debraj. Then she made me take on a fake case of a missing photograph. Then she sent Debraj to hire me for Ashok's death inquiry. Why? It was a set up, Jiten. A complete set up. So that they could avoid suspicion. Completely ruined our vacation! Debraj told Bapi that he bears a striking resemblance to Ashok! But at the stamp shop... the owner couldn't recognise Bapi. Even Indra didn't mention that Bapi looks like Ashok. Right? Then Debraj hired a guy to try and prove that Ashok wanted to sell the stamp. But at the stamp shop we found out that they don't have any employees. And... even the phone number he left at the shop is fake. This struck me as odd. If Aditya wanted to sell the stamp, why would he leave a fake number? And Aditya doesn't resemble Ashok. Then? Oh! Please come in. Come. Thank you, Sureta. If you hadn't told me about Ashok's last call to you... I wouldn't have been able to solve this case so easily. The thing is... Even before the confusion about the stamp started, Ashok was already dead. After blaming a dead man for theft... Debraj had planned to frame Aditya Das. Aditya had been under the radar for gambling anyway. Bipasha's family's photo was planted along with the envelope and the stamp... in Aditya's locker by Debraj. Hmm. Then why did he kill Bubun Kar? Debraj and Bipasha didn't expect that... Ashok would already tell Bubun that he was Sujoy Mitra's son. Ashok has told me everything. Now, will you give me the money or not? Are you insane? - Do you know who you're speaking to? - No point threatening me, ma'am. I can expose you right now. So decide wisely. The choice is yours. As soon as Ashok was killed... Bubun smelt a rat. Bubun needed money anyway. Do you guys remember? Bubun wanted money for his mom's treatment but Bipasha had refused. Mr. Sen... Please don't start working without an advance. You saw how she behaves, right? I'd asked for some money for my mother's treatment... Anyway. Remember my advice. Or all your efforts might be in vain. So the moment he heard about Ashok's death... he started blackmailing Bipasha for money. He threatened that if he didn't get the money... he would reveal that Ashok was Bipasha's step brother. That would lead the police on to other things. That's when Bipasha agreed to give him the money. Where's the money? Good. Put the bag down and step back. I hired you to find the missing photo. But neither the photo nor the envelope is missing, Ms. Mitra. That's a story Debraj and you cooked up. How will you prove it, Mr. Sen? Debraj was with me till 1:30 a.m. that night. No, ma'am. He wasn't with you. His watch gave him away! Thank you, Maria. I will charge you with defamation! Only when you're out of jail. So long. Oh, ma'am. Please give me the Vishnu idol. What! How dare you? That belongs to the Government of India. - Your father stole it-- - Damn it! You think I'm a liar? I told you it's lost. It's lost, lost, lost! Bapi, Promotho, help me out. Come here. Security! Throw these men out! Don't mistake my politeness for my weakness. - Bapi. - Yeah. Remove these. Ma'am, this was a good place to hide it. But the very first day I'd seen the bubble wrap peeking out. This is Promotho... Professor at Chica... Chicago University, right? Thank you. Mr. Rajiv Gurung! - Get a lady constable. - Okay, sir. Can I ask you a question? Go ahead. How did Debraj's watch give him away? - Sir... - Hmm. You told me that a smart watch tracks all your physical activities. It tracks the number of steps you walk and that's synced on a mobile app. Debraj was smart enough to leave his phone behind but he was still wearing his watch. So what? Exactly what was supposed to happen. After the murder, he collected the phone from Bipasha at 1:30 a.m. That's it! The watch synced with the phone. On this hunch, I asked Mr. Gurung to seize the phone. That was conclusive evidence. What evidence? - Sir, Ashok was killed around 9:00 p.m. - Right. Before that, he had called Indra at 8:30 p.m. and Sureta at 8:45 p.m. So he was killed between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m. Debraj claimed to have been at Raj Villa till 1:30 a.m. That they had dinner and discussed his new project. But it's a lie. According to the smart watch data between 9:00 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. Debraj's walking movement and heart rate had been erratic. Particularly between 9:00 and 9:10 p.m. his heart rate was nearly 102. That's the time of murder. Right, sir. He had been running about after that too. He had to dump the body, after all. Everything was synced on the app. You're a shrewd guy, mister! You say you're bad with technology, as if you're so naive. Come on, sir! You guys taught me all this. Like I said, it was Bapi who cracked this case. Thank you, sir. Save it for later. Tell me this. Bipasha had given Debraj the envelope. How did you find out? You're a "Chhupa Rustam", a hidden gem! Isn't that one of Dev Anand's films? You remember this, huh? "Yes!" One more thing. How did you know the idol is inside the centre table? Could've been something else in the bubble wrap. Possible. But remember when we first visited Raj Villa? Bubun Kar warned us to ensure our efforts don't go to waste. He thought I was there to look for the idol. And he knew where it was. But the rest was a spot in the dark. - "Shot." - Right. You have sharp eyes. Then let's go clear my name. Go where? You guys bought me coffee. Let me take you for lunch. You know what this is called? Say the correct proverb! I know this. When it rains without clouds! Fantastic! Three cheers for Ekendra Sen. - Hip, hip, hurrah! - Hurrah! - But tell me. - Yes? Clouds are full of water anyway. Let's just go. Hey! Sir? - Did I say something wrong? - Go away. Oh, sir! Bapi sir! Promotho? This time I'll definitely treat you. Believe me.
