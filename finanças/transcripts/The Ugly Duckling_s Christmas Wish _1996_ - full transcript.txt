[music playing] MR. CRUMBS: This is a Christmas story. Oh, I know it doesn't look much like Christmas now, but that's because our story actually starts several months earlier. My name is Mr. Crumbs, and I am a mouse-- a mouse of distinction I might add. And this is a story of how I came to meet my fine-feathered friend, Omar, and how he came to meet a certain little girl named Ruby during one wonderful Christmas. But I'm getting ahead of myself. It all began here at the edge of this tranquil little pond with an expectant mother patiently waiting on a nest for the big event. Unfortunately, someone was lurking in the bushes with other plans. [music playing] Boo. [screams] My egg. My baby. Don't hurt my baby, please. [crash] [suspense music] My baby, give me my baby back you horrible beast. No, I don't got it no more lady. Look. No! [bird screeching] Give me my baby! [suspense music] [bird screeching] [suspense music] [bird screeching] [truck] [music playing] What is it? Is it time? Is it time? No, I'm just stretching for heaven's sakes, Drake. Why are you so nervous? It's not like you have to drive me to a hospital or anything. I can't help it. It's a first time father thing. Well, I wish you'd just settle down. And stop that pacing. You're driving me crazy. Oh, my baby. My poor baby. I'll never see you again. MILDRED: Drake. Drake, come to. It's all over. I need some help with these babies. Drake! Am I a father yet? Yes, Drake. You passed out when the first one hatched. What's the matter with the big one? Why didn't it hatch? Don't ask me. I've got my wings full all ready. DRAKE: It's happening, Mildred, it's happening. MILDRED: Don't faint! [music playing] [yell] MILDRED: Oh, honestly, Drake. [scream] He's big. He's ugly. Clumsy too. [laughter] [music playing] Ohhh. [music playing] [thunder storm] [music playing] [whistle] [music playing] [sad music] [lullaby] [crying] [music playing] MR. CRUMBS: Poor Omar, and things didn't get any better for him as summer turned to fall, fall turned to winter, and Christmas was in the air. [christmas music] I don't care what anybody says. Sliding on this stuff is fun, as fun as swimming in it. Oh, no, look Cindy. Here comes that big, fat, geeky brother of yours. Quack. He can't even quack right. Oh no, he's going to try to skate. Save yourself. Omar's coming. Oh no, look out. Look out everybody. [scream] [laughter] Where'd Omar go? I don't know I was too busy watching the others. Man, they really went flying. Why do I have to have a geeky brother? He embarrasses our whole family. It's just not fair. Maybe you can wish him away on the Christmas Star. The what? Don't you know anything. Oh, that's right this is your first Christmas. Yeah. Hey, it's your first Christmas too. But I'm older. A couple of days. That's older. Besides I'm bright, so momma tells me stuff. And she told me at Christmas, which it almost is, you make a wish on the Christmas star, and then the wish you wish you get for Christmas. Really? Of course, see up there, the brightest one. Go ahead. Wish your goofball brother gone. I don't know. It's awfully mean. He'll embarrass you for the rest of your life. Magic Christmas wishing star, I wish my brother Omar was gone. It's as good as done. I feel guilty. It's not really his fault that he's odd. And ugly and clumsy and dumb. Mean ducks, I wish I was gone to. I wish I could find a new home. (SINGING) The Christmas star is a symbol of hope for you. Make a wish, and it could come true. Just you wait and see. The Christmas star fills the sky on the darkest night, fills your heart with a shining light, sets your spirit free. Go on, make a wish on the Christmas star. What have you got to lose? In a season filled with miracles, one could come to you. The Christmas star fills the sky on the darkest night, fills your heart with a shining light, sets your spirit free. The Christmas star holds the door to a better day, holds a promise that lights the way, if you believe. Go on, make a wish on the Christmas star. What have you got to lose? In a season filled with miracles, one could come to you. Go on, make a wish. Go on, make a wish. Go on, go on, go on. Street people, street kids, those that some refer to as misfits in our society. They come together at shelters such as these to find a glimmer of Christmas cheer. Those that society has forgotten, those that don't fit in, who are different, who else do they have during this holiday season but each other? They are still another facet of Christmas in the city. I could go there to the city. She said there were people there that didn't fit in, that were different like me. Oh, I can't do that. I'm just a little kid. A little kid that everybody hates. Bunch of hayseed ducks. I don't like them much either. I want to be happy, to find someone who likes me. But how am I going to get there? If you're really a Christmas wishing star, then my wish is for you to find some way for me to go to the city where I can have some friends. BOY: Can I go to the city with you tonight dad? Nope, got Christmas shopping to do. I could help. The shopping I'm doing is for you. Then I can really help. Yeah. It worked. My Christmas wish worked. The farmer's going to the city. This is my big chance. Oh, thank you. Thank you. A place where I belong. Hey, hey, wait for me! Wait for me! Oh, I made it. Who says I'm clumsy. I made it, and I'm on my way. Merry Christmas to me. I'm going to find me some friends. MR. CRUMBS: Omar was on his way to the big city, a city full of bright lights and people full of Christmas cheer, except over at my neighborhood on the wrong side of the tracks. [christmas music] In my neighborhood, there wasn't a Christmas decoration to be found and nobody had much to be cheerful about, especially another little run-away-- an 8-year-old girl named Ruby. She was frightened of the dirty streets she was walking through and had every reason to be. [music playing] [man mumbling] I can't go in there. MR. CRUMBS: No, she couldn't go in there, but she did need to get out of the cold. And it wasn't long before she discovered the window to the cellar. My private entrance. [bumping] [scream] What in the world? [clock] Oh, you, you miserable bird you. You could have gotten me murdered. I shall disconnect you. I will, but first I must assess the situation outside. Stay right where you are. Oh, this is not good, not good at all. This place is kind of dirty and creepy. No. No, no, don't come this way. She's coming this way. Shh, she'll here you, uh me. Well, at least it's warm. What's a little girl like that doing in a place like this? She's moving in. That's what she's doing. Oh, what a fine little Christmas gift this is. I finally find a decent home, and a human being moves in right next door. I'm trapped, trapped like a mouse. The moment I set foot outside, she will see me, shriek, and then attempt to batter me with a broom or a shovel or maybe a-- oh, what difference does it make what kind of weapon she uses? I'll still be just as dead. Think. Think. [music playing] [christmas music] This is a big place. I wonder where that shelter thing is that woman was talking about on TV. Maybe it's this way. [ding] Hey, watch it. Look out. I'm down here. Woo, well, at least they can't step on me under here. [growl] [chase music] [barking] Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. [barking] Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. [creepy music] Get out, you lazy good for nothing bum. I'm gone. I ain't coming back here. People just try and put me out. I've got to be brave. It's awful lonesome here. I mustn't be afraid. I just can't go home. [crying] Poor little thing. What in the world is she doing here? No, no, none of that. None of that feeling sorry for anyone. Sentiment gives way to rash actions, and rash actions can cost a mouse his life. Remember that. I'm on my own. She's on her own. Nothing I can do to help her any way. At least that wretched dog has stopped barking. Now if she would just stop crying. I'm not going to get a moment's rest. This didn't turn out the way I thought it would. Merry Christmas to me. [christmas music] Well, at least she's still asleep. Now if I can just find something to eat and get back home before she wakes up, I'll be set for the day. Fresh snow, looks like Christmas. Too bad it doesn't feel like Christmas to me. I-- OMAR: Excuse me. Can you help me? [screaming] How dare you go sneaking up on me. For heaven's sake, you nearly scared me to death. If you had been a carnivore, I daresay you would have scared me to death. You aren't a carnivore, are you? No, I'm a duck. You don't look like any duck I've ever seen. OK, and ugly duck. Well, I wouldn't say that. How come? Everybody else does. Just go away. Nobody wants to help a crummy, little duck. Who feels sorry for himself. I got good reasons. That's how come I ran away from home. There appears to be a lot of that going around these days. See back on the farm-- Oh, farm boy. Uh-huh Come to the big city to seek fame and fortune. Well, sorry kid. If, I knew how to find that, I wouldn't be living in a cuckoo clock. But I'm not looking for fame and fortune. Well, what then? Something called a homeless shelter I think. MR. CRUMBS: Homeless shelter? See back on the farm everybody thinks I'm just a big, clumsy, dumb, old freak duck. Then I saw this thing on TV where people go who don't have any friends, people that don't fit in, people like me. People being the operative word here. Huh? MR. CRUMBS: I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings at Christmas me lad. but I strongly doubt they'll be welcoming ducks in there with open arms [omar chuckles] unless you're interested in being Christmas dinner, of course. What am I going to do? I wished on the Christmas star to find a new home. Christmas star? Hey, maybe I can move in with you. Now why in the world would I let you do that? It could be your Christmas present to me. Why in the world would I want to give you a Christmas present? I don't even know you. Oh, I'm Omar. How you do? I am Mr. Crumbs. I-- now wait a minute, I have enough problems without trying to stuff a duck into a cuckoo clock. Omar: -Uhm So I suggest you run along and-- Ahem oh, honestly I'm getting soft. I shall give you a Christmas present provided you will give me one in return. I ain't got nothing. Oh, but you do. I shall allow you to meet a certain little girl who will probably love and take care of you. MR. CRUMBS: You in return will promise to keep her from killing me when and if she ever sees me. It's a deal. Thanks, Crumby. That's Mr. Crumbs to you, not Crumby. Now let us proceed. Ya-hoo! [crash] [ruth gasps] Who-- who are you? Quack Oh, why you must be a little duck, aren't you? I'm sorry I screamed, but you made a lot of noise and woke me up. My name is Ruby. What's yours? Too bad ducks can't talk to people I mean. Guess you can talk to each other. Get a bunch of ducks together, and they'd go quackers. That was a joke. My dad told me. My name's Ruby. Guess I said that already, didn't I? What are you doing here? This is a pretty weird place for a little duck. Pretty weird place for a little girl too. I'm here, because I ran away from home. I - I had to. I've been pretty lonesome, especially since it's almost Christmas and all. It's pretty awful, but then I guess you wouldn't understand. You do. You didn't run away from home too, did you? Really? So do you have a place to stay? Oh, yes, you do. You can stay with me. We can have a wonderful time. Right now we can have breakfast. I brought some stuff with me. Are you hungry? Well, come on. You can choose, corn chips or chocolate chip cookies? I didn't bring any of that junk I don't like. Which do you want? That's good. Now we each get what we really want the most. We're going to be such good friends. I just know it. And this place isn't so bad. We can find-- [scream] [thump] What was that? What's the matter boy. What you are doing? What the-- what's going on? Hello? Hello? I'm smothering in here. What's in there. Come on, let me see. Come on, what is it? A mouse. Whoops, sorry. Whoa! Feisty, isn't he? I got an idea. Wait right here. MR. CRUMBS: You were supposed to protect me. I tried. She's going to get something to kill me. Kick the pot. Kick the pot. Get me out of here. I got you a cookie. Oh, where'd he go? There he goes. Miserable bird. I bet that's his house. RUTH: You were trying to hide him. RUTH: Is he your friend? MR. CRUMBS: That's it. Tell her everything. Mice are nervous. I know. I had a pet one once. He got loose in the house. Mother bopped him with a broom. Well, we'll leave this here in case he gets hungry. [munching] I saw this last night when I was looking around. We can use all this old stuff to decorate for Christmas. (SINGING) This place is, kind of, dreary, and we've only got a cardboard tree. It isn't much like home, and it doesn't feel too Christmasy. But I can color pictures to put up on the walls, while you untangle all those lights, so we can deck the halls. We'll make the very best of what we've got. Although it's almost Christmas and we haven't got a lot, I've got you and you've got me. That makes us a family. And family is all you really need to make Christmas great indeed. Here I was at Christmas, all gloomy and doomy, then you fell in the window and now I have a roomy. Up till now I always got a 10-foot pile of stuff. But this year all I got is you, and guess what? That's enough. We'll make the very best of what we've got. Although it's almost Christmas and we haven't got a lot, I've got you and you've got me. That makes us a family, and family is all you really need, yes indeed. [music playing] Love's our greatest present, and it doesn't cost a penny. When you care about someone your blessings will be many. So chase away those Christmas blues and paint them red and green. Side by side, our holiday will be the best we've seen. We'll make the very best of what we've got, although we've got a Christmas tree that doesn't look so hot. And Santa might not find us, but we can't let that blind us to the fun that we can have hand in hand in our private Christmas land. We'll make the very best of what we've got, although it's almost Christmas and we haven't got a lot. I've got you, and you've got me. That makes us a family, and family is all you really need to make Christmas great indeed. [christmas music] Well, it's a little crooked, but it'll do. Sure wish we had a star to go on top, but you can't have everything. [footsteps] They'll find us. They'll put us in jail. Come on. [suspense music] I'm tired of people messing with my stuff. Where is it? And why [inaudible] When I get my hands on him. [suspense music] [crash] Phew. That was close. I'm so scared. I don't want to be here anymore. [crying] I'm sorry. I just miss my mother and father. That's all. RUTH: But I can't go home. I just can't. I had to run away. I had to. See, the other night I came down the hall to get a glass of water, and I heard my mom and dad. They said we were going to have a new baby, and they were worrying about not having enough money and having to go to the poor house. Little babies need love, and they knew their mom and dad just like I did. But see I'm eight years old now-- almost a grown up. I just wanted to make sure that my new little brother or sister would get what I got, and I didn't want my mom and dad to worry because of me. So see I had to run away from home. But I can't help but miss them, especially at Christmas time. You know what I wish? I wish-- oh, but what difference does it make what I wish? What? What are you doing? Where are we going? Well, OK, I'll follow you, but I don't get it. That poor little thing. She can stay here just as long as she wants to. [music playing] RUTH: OK, so what are we doing here? Yeah, it's the sky. Oh my, what a pretty star. Hey, maybe we should make a wish. That's That's what you brought me up here for, isn't it? To make a wish. How's a little ducky know about wishing stars. Do you think it really works? Well, then let's try it. But we shouldn't tell each other what our wishes are, or they won't come true. [ruth giggles] Of course, you couldn't tell me what yours was even if you wanted to. [ruth thinking to herself] [ruth thinking to herself] The only thing I wish I could have for Christmas is to be back at home with mom and dad again, and that it would be OK. [omar thinking to himself] I don't really have a wish. You already made mine come true. But if I had a wish, it could be that Ruby and me would always be together. RUTH: Well, we'll see. Who knows? Maybe our wishes will both come true. RUTH: Merry Christmas, ducky. One of these is lose. If I can find the right one, we might just get them to light up. I hope it isn't burned out. Yay, I did it. It's not as nice as the one we had at home. You think Santa Claus will find us here? Oh, everything will be fine. We'll have a wonderful Christmas. I've even got a little present for you, ducky. One of these days I'm going to have to decide on a name for you. Ducky just doesn't make it. I didn't have anything to wrap it with, and it's kind of old. Her name is Sydney. She was mind. Merry Christmas. Take good care of her. She's pretty nice. [christmas music] [ruby crying] [mr. crumbs hears ruby crying] [sad music] MR. CRUMBS: Poor kid. She cried herself to sleep again. I think it's because I didn't get her a Christmas present. MR. CRUMBS: No. Maybe cause she's afraid Santa Clause is going to find her. No, I don't think so. OMAR: Well, what? She's homesick. She misses her mother and father. A little girl like that shouldn't be here. She should be at home. She shouldn't have run away. She had to. I don't know. I wonder if she didn't get something mixed up. I still want to give her a present. Well, I can't quite see a mouse and a duck waltzing into a toy store with no money. I'll find something even if you don't want to help me. Oh, wait. Wait for me. MR. CRUMBS: How do I get myself into these things? Because your nice. You may be crabby and cranky on the outside, but you're nice on the inside. And just what kind of Christmas present do you have in mind? Something good. Oh, well, that narrows it down. [omar singing] What would put the merry in Merry Christmas? What would put the happy in Happy New Year? That's the perfect present, I can give her that is full of Christmas cheer. What kind of present? A pheasant might be pleasant. I'm the only bird that Ruby needs. The Mona Lisa or the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Those are both a bit beyond my means. What kind of gift would give me a lift? What about a quarter pound of cheese, cheese, cheese? Stick to the mission. Stop your wishing. Ruby is the one we're here to please. So sorry. What will put the merry in Merry Christmas? What will put the happy in happy in Happy New Year? What's the perfect present I can give her-- BOTH: That is full of Christmas cheer. [MR. CRUMB SINGING The cliffs of Dover or a four leaf clover or some rain from that plain in Spain or a choo choo train or a whooping crane. OMAR: With no money all those things go down the drain. Think plain. Think simple. Use your brain. Strain. I have it. You do? It's me. It's you? What about a mouse to have around the house? I could sing and dance and chase away her gloom. I could wiggle and jiggle until I made her giggle. I can finagle till I brighten up her room. It's a nice idea But, I simply can't agree, because your little plan is filled with doom, doom, doom. If she ever goes home and you decide decide to roam, her mother's going to bop you with a broom, boom. Ouch, that sounds painful. Let's look about. I'll be the scout. There's treasure to be found upon these streets. If you see something, shout, and I'll dig it out. Between the two of us, we can't us, be beat. [both]: We will find a treasure for Ruby's Christmas pleasure, and nothing's going to stop us till we're done, done, done. For our Christmas day, Ruby's going to play with something that we got her that is fun, fun, fun. We will put the merry in Merry Christmas. We can put the happy in Happy New Year. We can find a perfect present to give her that will brim with Christmas cheer. [music playing] Hey, I don't know why the boss wanted this Christmas stuff all taken down tonight. It's Christmas Eve, and I'm still here working. Eh, shut up and get the next load. MR. CRUMBS: Well, we tried to find something. That isn't good enough. Now Ruby's still going to be sad. Well, like I said, I think she's unhappy about more than-- Look it over there. Look on top. That star, Ruby said she wanted one for the top of our Christmas tree. That's what I can give her. It's a thought, but how are you going to get it? I'll think of something. That's what I was afraid of. OMAR: It's pretty tall. Could you boost me up? Highly unlikely. Well, maybe I could boost you up. I'm not going up there. Aw, come on, Crummy. No, don't you dare, MR. CRUMBS and stop calling me crummy! I'm not tall enough to boost you. Oh, thank goodness. Heaven only knows what's in that thing. I'm cold. Let's go home. OMAR: Here hold on to this. What for? OMAR: Just hold on tight. Why? What are you? [omar yell] OMAR: Why did you do that? Now you can get to the star and throw it down to me. MR. CRUMBS: The star is way up there. I fell clear down here. That's what the string is for. I'll pull you up. MR. CRUMBS: There's only one thing wrong your little plan. OMAR: What's that? MR. CRUMBS: I let go of the string. How come you did that? MR. CRUMBS: I thought it would be fun. Get me out of here. You sure you don't got hold of the string. Yes, I'm sure I don't got hold of the string. It's tangled on some coat hangers up there. Maybe-- maybe I can climb up it. What are you doing out there? Oh, just hanging around. What are you doing up there? Trying to get the star for Ruby. Get me out of here first, then get the stupid star. I almost got it. Woah! OMAR: Hello MR. CRUMBS: Great move duck. Now we're both stuck down here. OMAR: No, we're not. MR. CRUMBS: [yell] Stop throwing me around. Sorry. Can you fly out of there? OMAR: Well, I can try. I can't do it. What kind of duck are you anyway? A little one. What are we going to do? MR. CRUMBS: Wait a minute. I have an idea. Now where's the end of that string. I'm tying a rock to the end of the string, then I'll throw it to you. You can climb up. OMAR: The last time I tried that the string broke. Well, unless you have any other ideas. OMAR: Ow, you hit me on the head. Oops, a thousand pardons. Are you coming? OMAR: Yes, I'm coming. Don't doddle. What if it breaks again? Then you'll fall. Hurry up before a garbage truck comes along and squishes you in its steely jaws. OK. This is hard. My wings are tired from trying to fly. I can't do it. It's too hard. I think I hear that garbage truck. I made it. Splendid. Now what are you doing? I just want to get the star. I swear if you fall in again, I'm washing my hands of you. I made it. I got it. Woah. Don't fall in. Don't fall in. MR. CRUMBS: Don't fall on me either. (SINGING) We will put the merry in Merry Christmas. We will put the happy in Happy New Year. We have found the perfect present for Ruby-- That will brim with Christmas cheer. OMAR: Look, that's Ruby. MR. CRUMBS: I dare say it is. MADELYN: I'll go ask at that house. She's coming this way. Hide! I wonder who she is. Shh. Yes? Maybe you can help me. I wondered if maybe you'd seen our little girl. She ran away from home. She left a note. She misunderstood something, and I wondered if maybe you'd seen her. No. Oh, you poor people and on Christmas Eve. Oh, please keep this, and if you do see her-- I'll keep my eyes open. I promise. Thank you. MADELYN: She-- she hadn't seen her. [cries] What did we do? What did we say? How could she ever think we didn't want her? Oh, Richard, what are we going to do? It's OK. It'll be all right. We'll put up the rest of these posters, and then we'll check back with the police. And then we'll find her, Madelyn. We'll find her. I knew she had it all wrong. Let's go. Go where? To get Ruby. But why? We've got to somehow let her know about her parents. I don't want to. Let's pretend we never saw them. Now hold the phone there buster. OMAR: What? Look at those poor people out there. You could listen to them and still go back to Ruby and act like nothing has happened. I don't care. You don't care. You don't care that Ruby and her mother and father-- that all of their hearts are breaking? Ruby was crying, because she was worried about Santa Clause. I don't think so. OMAR: Or because I hadn't got her a present. Ruby was my wish from the Christmas star. If she goes home with them, then she won't be with me anymore. That's not fair. I had my wish, and it came true. So you're willing to go back there and give her that pitiful little tree ornament instead of what you know she really needs and wants to go home with her mother and father. You don't really think she can survive on her own, do you? She'll have me. And you'll feed and clothe her and put a roof over your head. Well, I could try. You talk a good Christmas game, but when you come smack up against the true meaning of Christmas, you turn your head. Christmas, in case you've forgotten, is for giving to others. You've spent so much time feeling sorry for yourself, you can't even see that anymore. I'm sorry your family didn't love you the way Ruby's parents love her, but just because you couldn't have that is no reason to take it away from someone else. So go on. Give her your little tin trinket. Merry Christmas to you, but don't come looking for me if you get into trouble. Because I've had it. You can stay with me. We can have a wonderful time. MR. CRUMBS: Poor kid. She cried herself to sleep again. We're going to be such good friends. I just know it. She's homesick. She misses her mother and father. Oh, everything will be fine. We'll have a wonderful Christmas. MR. CRUMBS: A little girl like that shouldn't be here. She should be at home. She shouldn't have run away. I'm so scared. I don't want to be here anymore. MR. CRUMBS: She's homesick. She misses her mother and father. I just miss my mother and father. That's all. A little girl like that shouldn't be here-- shouldn't be here-- shouldn't be here-- shouldn't be here. Wait, Mr. Crumbs, please! OMAR: I'll do it. I don't want to hurt Ruby. I knew you'd come around. Who wants this lousy old star anyway? It's a fine gift. It's just not the finest one you can give. What'll I do? Go get Ruby. MR. CRUMBS: You've got to get her out here somehow-- out here on the street, where they can see each other. And hurry, before her mother and father leave. OK. [music playing] Hurry! What? What's going on? What are you doing, ducky? Hey, where are you going with my hat? Come back here, ducky! Come on. It's too late at night to be playing games. He isn't going to make it. He isn't going to make it. [music playing] Come back here. This isn't funny. No! Ruby! Oh my baby! Mother, no! No, Ruby! No, don't run. Honey, you got it all wrong. Don't run away. We love you. The thought of having a new baby in our house without you there to help us love and take care of it is tearing our hearts apart. MADELYN: You misunderstood, Ruby. We didn't mean the things we said the way you heard them. Honey, we're a family, and no matter what, we will always need each other. And no matter what happens, we must always stay together. We love you. I don't want us to have to go to the poor house. Oh, honey. I'm so sorry I said that. It was just an expression, a silly expression. They don't even have poor houses anymore. All of us will be just fine. I promise. Really? Mom. Daddy. MADELYN: My baby. Oh, I was so afraid I'd never see you again. RUBY: I missed you both so much. Don't ever think we don't love you or don't want you ever. Merry Christmas, Daddy. I'll never ask for another Christmas present as long as I live. I wonder if this was Ruby's Christmas wish. MR. CRUMBS I wouldn't be a bit surprised. I wished that Ruby and me could always be together. Oh, well, you've still got me. Thanks. [christmas music playing] But I can't go home without my duck. Duck, what duck? My duck. We've been friends. I haven't named him yet. But you know, he came and got me. He stole my hat and made me chase him out here. He must have know you were here. Of course, dear. Well, heck, what's the price of a little duck food? You mean it? We've got that little pond out behind the house. I'll bet your friend would be very happy there. Especially with the new arrivals. New arrivals? But-- but wait, where is he? Wait, wait, mom and dad said you could go home with us. Let's go. Yippee! Well, it looks as though your Christmas wish is going to come true too. Come on. Let's go. Oh, no. They'll let a duck into that car, but I'll wager they'll draw the line at mice. Then I can hide you under my hat. It took me all my life to find this splendid little house I have in that clock. I'm even getting rather attached to that infernal cuckoo bird. Besides, I am a mouse of distinction. I need bright lights and the excitement of the city. Gosh, I'll miss you, Crumbs. That's Mr. Crumbs to you. I'll miss you, Mr. Crumbs. And I shall miss you. But remember if I am here, then it will give you some place to come on your vacation. What is that duck doing? Well, he has to say goodbye to his mouse friend. Of course, he does dear. Don't you know anything, Richard? MR. CRUMBS: Enough of this emotion. You're smothering me. Let go. Now hurry before they go off and leave and I'm stuck with you. Goodbye! I'll never forget you. Nor I you. Now go. Nor I you. MR. CRUMBS: The next day at their house in the country, Ruby and her parents shared a wonderful Christmas morning. MADELYN: What'd he say? ROBERT: Well, it wasn't Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. RUBY: Oh, great. Thanks mom. MADELYN: Of course, dear. ROBERT: Hey, honey, before you get too caught up in that one, there's another one over here with your name on it. MR. CRUMBS: Omar, on the other hand, was beginning to feel a little left out. Something's wrong. I got my Christmas wish, and I love being here with Ruby. But it's not like I hoped it would be. She has her own family now, and she needs them a lot more than she needs me. I'm starting to feel like I don't belong again. Maybe I never will. Wonder who that is? Merry Christmas. Hi, do you live here? We're new. We just moved in our whole family. You got something in your eye? You want to play? My name's Meredith. This is Sutty. He's my brother. You want to play with him? You don't think I'm ugly? If you're ugly, I'm ugly. Because you look just like me, and I'm not ugly. I think you're kind of cute. What kind of ducks are you? Ducks? We're not ducks. We're swans. What's a swan? You're a swan. Is your mother a duck? No, she's a swan too. So is my dad. I don't get it. My mother was a duck. My father was a duck. My brothers and sisters were ducks, but I'm a swan. Look it. Look at his head. He really looks like us. He's got that funny little spot on his head. The one that mama says comes from Daddy's side of the family. Who's that? That's my mama. She's beautiful. You mean I'm going to grow up to look just like that. I hope not. Mom's a girl. Hello, children. Who's your handsome new friend? She called me handsome. Look, mama, he's got the family curse, the spot. What? Why I've never seen a spot like that on anyone but-- oh my goodness. What is it, mama? I didn't think it could be possible. Somehow my precious little baby has come home to me. What? What do you mean? You are my son. A long time ago you were stolen from me. I was. I tried so hard, but I could never find you again. You mean that guy's my brother that you keep talking about-- the one that got lost when he was an egg? Yes, honey he is. You mean I really am a swan? I never thought I'd get to see your beautiful little face. Yes, darling, you're a swan. Come here. [splash] Oh, I never thought I'd get to hold you. Cool. I got a new brother. Oh, yuck. That means I just told my brother I thought he was cute. [laughter] All this time I thought I was a duck. You'd made one ugly duckling. But you make a beautiful swan. Oh, this is the most wonderful Christmas present any of could ever have. Come on, let's go find your father and tell him the wonderful news. I had to introduce you to your other brothers and sisters too. So that's what you meant about the new arrivals. Uh-huh. They just showed up yesterday. Maybe it was fate. I don't know about that. I think this is just one year where everybody's Christmas wishes came true. MR. CRUMBS: So Omar and his family and Ruby and her family all joined together to make one big happy family. And believe it or not, this city mouse turned country mouse when later I came to live with them. But, well, that's another story. Merry Christmas, everybody. [music playing]
