-Thank you, Volodya. -Madam. -Excellency. -I thought so, too. He was impressed with what you said. They all were. Not only the Grand Duke, but everybody. If only that were so. You had a fine time, didn't you? Indeed I did. I saw my husband honored. You looked very grand. -In this? Feels like something from an operetta. -Even so. Come, let's show Seryozha your medal. But it's late now. He's asleep. -We promised. -So we did. Seryozha... Seryozha... We've come home. Mama. We promised we'd come and see you, and here we are, my darling. Papa, too. Is that the medal? Can I see it? Oh! -Is that the highest one there is? -No. There are higher orders, one or two. Do you think I'll ever have one? If you work hard. -Go to sleep now. -Yes, sir. One last thing. -Have you decided what you want from Moscow? -Mmm. What shall I bring you back? A magnifying glass. Whatever for? My tutor has one, but I want my own. We study things, you know. Of course, of course. You shall have one. I'll be gone so quick, you won't even miss me. I packed all that. It's in there with the blouses and the ball gown. I'm not going to any balls in Moscow. I shan't need it. Packed is packed. I'll be the judge of what you need. Ooh, you'll spoil me one day. - I saw to that years ago. - I know. Good night. Sir. The way you women travel, one might think you weren't ever coming back. Oh, I won't be long. As soon as I've patched up Stiva's marriage. Just a week or so. Hmm... Your brother is unfaithful, and I pay the price. -You'll do no good. -Stiva's an angel. Fallen angel. That I'll grant you. I suppose so. Alexei, Seryozha wants a magnifying glass. Imagine that. He's growing up. Do you think he'll be all right? -We haven't been apart since he was born. -It's good for him. Oh, perhaps it is. Why should I feel so odd? -Can it be wrong of me to go? -I shall miss you. But it isn't wrong. I'll be in my study for a while. Alexei? If I should die, would you remarry? What a question. -Would you? -No. What makes you ask? Departures make me sad, I think. I'll miss you, too. Moscow! Moscow! Moscow Central. I can't thank you enough. The time has passed so quickly. Will I find Moscow changed, you think? Oh, I shouldn't think so. It's still just as stodgy as ever it was. If Alexei were not on leave here, I wouldn't bother to visit the place. You will see why I've been boasting when you meet him. I shall go, madam. And see the luggage is attended to. So will I. If you'll excuse me, Countess, I have to see if my brother's there. Of course. Her Excellency, her Excellency. Excuse me. The Countess is in cabinet number four. Get the luggage. Oh! Oh, sorry. Ah, there you are, Mama. -I found you. -Alexei. How was your journey? Most enjoyable, for a change. - Of course, I've had the most delightful company, madam Karenina. You must meet her. Her husband put her in with me. You know Karenin, of course. I've met him once or twice. We move in very different circles. I've known the man for years. She's not a bit like him. She's enchanting. We've been talking all the way from St. Petersburg. About our sons. Your mother spoke of hers and I of mine. Count Vronsky. Madam Karenina. Anna has a boy of eight. They've never been parted before. Mmm... Is he to be a statesman like his father? Oh, it's a little soon to tell. - You know how mothers are. They have great expectations. Oh, you've been talking nonsense, have you? Never you mind. Well, how long do you plan to stay in Moscow? I don't know. Um... A week or two. It all depends. It's very pleasant here just now. Well, it is in Petersburg, of course, but the opera's on. There is the ballet. -Where are you staying? -At my brother's. -Anna! -Stiva! Excuse me. -Anna! Oh, Anna. Dear, dear Anna. -Oh, Stiva! Oh! Oh, you're a saint for coming. Through and through. Stiva, if I'd known, we could have driven down together. Vronsky, what are you... Oh, yes, of course, your mother's coming. Oh, you must meet my sister. Yes, I just have. Splendid. I looked for you last night at Kitty's house. Ah, yes. Couldn't come. I should've... Something's happened. There's been an accident. -Someone's dead. -Let's hope not. Stationmaster! -Yes, Excellency. -What's happened? A workman in the yard. The train moved suddenly. It crushed him. That's his wife. She witnessed it. She saw it happen? She was there? Yes, poor woman. She's left with heaven knows how many children. How dreadful! Can't anything be done for her? Very little, I'm afraid. You see... Here. Give her this. 200 rubles? Excellency, it's too much. You see that she gets it. As you say, Excellency. There ought to be pensions, compensations, something for these people, don't you think? Well, shall we be off? Don't wait. We'll see you at the carriage right before you go. Vronsky. -Ah, Mama, let me help you. -Madam. Thank you, my dearest. What is it? What's the matter, Anna? I don't know. Do you believe in omens, Stiva? Omens? -That poor woman. -Oh, nonsense. Accidents are accidents. I mean, suppose we'd seen... What? A couple kissing. What would that have meant, eh? -Have you known Vronsky long? -Oh. quite some time. Yes. Apparently he's interested in Kitty. -Dolly's sister? She's just a child. -Mmm-hmm. Oh, she's 19. We have high hopes he'll marry her. He's a splendid fellow. Don't you think? Oh! I must say, that was very generous of Vronsky. 200 rubles, that should feed those children for a year. Yes, but even so, it was too much. Yes, well. I don't really care about that. It's me I want to talk about. Oh, Anna, I'm pinning all my hopes on you. If Dolly leaves me, I... It's too terrible to contemplate. I'm lost without her, you know. That's the truth. I want the whole truth, everything you've done, with no excuses. I'm deeply fond of Dolly, and I do not approve of faithless husbands. -Even you. -I know, I know. I never mean these things to happen. Why does it always rain whenever I come to Moscow? - I don't know why it is. - It's cold. I do hope Suzanne handled the luggage. She is so useful. You're half asleep. You too. That's quite enough. It's past your bedtime. Ages past. Miss Hull. -Oh! Already? -No! -Oh! -Now, you've heard your mother. Come along now, all of you. -Good night, Mama. -Good night. -It's so early. -I don't want to go to bed. They're lovely, Dolly. So they are. They're everything to me, you know. I'll send for fresh tea, shall I? This is cold. No, not now. Dolly, Stiva has told me. I can't say anything in his defense, nor can I comfort you. It is impossible, I know. I ache for you. I feel so sorry. Tell me how it came about. Well, I know the story as Stiva sees it, but I do need to hear it from you. It's pointless. Everything's finished. It's all over. Stiva says you... You found a letter. From your children's governess. Their former governess. At least it didn't happen here while she was in the house. Oh, she's pretty, Anna. She's so pretty. What an innocent I've been. I've never once suspected Stiva. All these years, I thought I was the only woman he'd known. He keeps her, sends her presents, sees her constantly, and then, comes home, dear God, and kisses me. Men do these things. It's so unfair. They've no right to. You should see him, talk to him. What for? He'd only lie to me. He's desolate and so ashamed. Dolly, he loves you. He feels nothing. What's to be done? What am I to do? I pack and unpack once a day. The children tie me here. They love their father. Could you take your child away? No. Perhaps I'll go and leave the children here with him. You can't. No mother could. I know. I'm trapped here, Anna. Help me. Think for me. What's to be done? -Forgive him. -How? I close my eyes and see them kissing, hear them saying things about me. How can I forgive him? -Could you do it? -I don't know. I can't judge. Yes, I could do it. It's only an affair. He's not in love with someone else. Oh, Dolly, for a while, things might not be the same. But, yes, I could forgive it all as if it never happened. Will I be torn away? Do you think that's possible? I know it. Oh, Anna. Oh... Hush, dear, hush. Shall I send Stiva up to see you? No. Not yet. I need to be by myself a while. What shall I tell him? Nothing. Stiva, what's the matter with you? -Matter? -Here, -look what you've given me. -Hmm? Oh! Not very clever of me, was it? I'm sorry. My mind is, um... Anna Arkadyevna! -Let me look at you. -I couldn't wait. I came the moment Stiva sent word you were here. It's been so long. -Well, then? -I am instructed to say nothing. Nothing? Not a word. Oh! Oh, I see you've worked a miracle. Oh. Excuse me. I must go and see her. -Stiva. -What? It may take a little time. -Little time? -Mmm-hmm. Oh, of course. Yes, I, uh... I understand. Well, in that event, I'll go and, um... Uh... I'll be in my study. Yes. He's seemed so strange for days now. Dolly, too. Is anything the matter? -No, no. I'm sure not. -Good. -You haven't changed. -Oh. You're just as I remember. I can't say the same thing for you. I know, I know. Will you be staying long? I hope so. There's so much to do in Moscow now. So many balls to go to. You enjoy them? Getting dressed and going dancing, all the music and flowers. Don't you love it? No, not much. Not anymore. You're very happy, aren't you, Kitty? Yes. I know why. Stiva told me. Oh. -What did he say? -That you were expecting a proposal. I can understand your happiness. I met Count Vronsky at the railway station. He was there? What did you think? I liked him very much. That's all? Well, we only had a moment, but I found him... Oh, Anna, he's everything I could wish. He's modest and sensitive and brave. He's fought in duels. You remind me of his mother. I was on the train with her. She talked about him all the way from Petersburg. Oh, tell me. Tell me everything. Well, there's so many stories. Um... If half of them are true, he's quite remarkable. He's going to be a colonel soon, she told me, and a general soon after that. There, you see! Did I exaggerate? Anna, there's a ball on Friday. Everyone will be there. Would you come? -I would rather not. -Anna, please! Kitty, why is this ball so special? You are expecting him to propose? Hmm? Has he ever spoken to you of his feelings? There's no need to. I can see it in his eyes. Imagine, my dear, that you are Vronsky for a moment. You are young and rich and handsome. You have all the world at your feet. And all its women, too. You have no reason to believe he's serious. I feel afraid for you. He loves me. There's no need to feel afraid. Be happy for me. Come to the ball. Please, Anna, just for me. I knew you would. You actually enjoy the country? Aren't you bored? Not really. I was brought up on my family's estate, you see, but I miss it. I visit whenever I can, which isn't often, I'm afraid. Even... Uh, would you excuse me, please, gentlemen? Is he looking at me? Every man in the room is looking at you. -Is my hair all right? -You look beautiful. He's going to ask me, Anna. It's tonight. I know it. Later, while we're dancing the mazurka. Why just then? I feel it, that's all. It's a feeling. I'll say yes right off. Yes, Alexei! Oh, thank you. She's enchanting, isn't she? You know, she was so excited, - she couldn't even wait for her mother to finish dressing. She's, uh, expecting great things of this evening. Well, why not? She's still so young. Alexei. Madam Karenina. He's a lucky fellow, Vronsky. - Are you certain that they're a good match? Certain? How could she do better? Well, I don't know, but his mother said there are a lot of women in his life. Hmm? Oh? Not anymore. There's only Kitty now. Were you watching? Did you see us? -What a lovely night! -May I? If Alexei doesn't mind. No, of course not. Madam Karenina. Thank you, but I rarely dance. Oh. Well, you should. It's an innocent pleasure that we have so few of. Have you enjoyed the city? By avoiding it. I've stayed at home. Do you stay at home in Petersburg as well? What makes you ask? Well, my regiment is stationed there, you see. I often see your husband at the palace, never you. My husband leads two lives. I am the private part of it. Well, if you were mine, I would show you off. Is it fulfilling, being private? Strange to say. I'm not entirely reclusive, of course. Ah, well, that's a mercy. Tell me, do you know Princess Betsy Tverskaya? Betsy? She's my good friend. She's my cousin, though I rarely see her. I must make a point of visiting her more often. Lovely, isn't she? Yes, she's a charming girl. She's more than that, Count Vronsky, she's in love with you. -She's not. -I can assure you. I've never led her to believe... I mean, we have never spoken of our feelings. Have you any? Well, yes, certainly. I'm very fond of her. But nothing more than that. Well, she's just a child. How could there possibly be more? She thinks there is. Oh, Lord. I was sure you felt this way. How could you know? I saw it when I met you. One day, my dear, you must give Dolly some dancing lessons. Oh, Stiva. -Wish me luck. -What for? -It's the mazurka next. -Ah. -He's coming now. -Oh, well, off you go then. Kitty! I felt tired. But it's your mazurka. You should be with Alexei. I've... Lost him, Dolly. Lost him? I've been such a fool. Thank you. Oh, there you are. Your mother's just arrived, Kitty. She's waiting for you in the dining room. -Kitty! -I'll go to her. May I have a word with you? You're a lovely dancer, Anna Arkadyevna. Better than... I'll ever be. Well, shall we all go in to dinner? I can't stay. I must go. Would you please give our hostess my regrets? But it... It's still so early. Not for me. I have to rest if I'm to go home tomorrow. Why so soon? I thought you were staying much longer. I must. -Count Vronsky. -Madam Karenina. Dolly, would you accompany me? Why tomorrow? There's so much we planned to do. Another time. Dolly, there's something... Something I must tell you. I've ruined Kitty's evening. I know. I saw you dancing. It should not have happened. It's my fault. She thinks she's lost him, Anna. But he was never hers to lose. He doesn't love her. Not in the least. In fact, it never crossed his mind. -You sound so sure. -He told me so. Well... It's for the best, I think. -What are you saying? -I was never much in favor of the match. How Kitty must be suffering. I've hurt her dreadfully. I should go to her. I can't bear it if she doesn't forgive me. Oh, it will pass. Who doesn't fall in love at that age? But it was her mazurka, and I knew it. Even so, it was Vronsky who deceived her, dear, not you. But I'm party to it, am I not? -Dear God, what must she think of me? -I'll talk to her. Let me. I'm her sister, after all. It would have happened anyway without you, even if you hadn't been here. Tell her... I... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. No, it's all right, Annushka. I don't need it. If I'm cold, you're cold. You have a fever. Is that it? No, truly not. Well, there's something. It's just, um... Excitement of packing, goodbyes. And going home again, that too. I Miss Seryozha very much. We left in such a rush, I never got his magnifying glass. Do you think he'll mind? He's growing up so fast. I look at him some days and wonder who he is. -He's changing. -Everybody changes. Oh, not another stop. This ought to be a lesson to me. I'm not meant to be away. I like my things around me. I like knowing where I am. A few more hours, we'll be home. It's stifling in here. Shall I get some air? I think I will. -Would you like to? No? -No. Madam. Thank you. Good evening. I'm sorry if I startled you. -How can you be here? -I saw you from my window. You said nothing last night about leaving Moscow. True. Have you been called back to your regiment? -Then what? -You know the answer. No, I don't. Nor do I want to hear it. I've come to be where you are. I'm going home, Count Vronsky, to my husband and my son. Whatever happened last night when we danced, whatever name you choose to give it... I know what it was. We both do. I suspect we see it differently. For me, it was a moment. I admit it. I feel strong and sure enough to tell you so. It happened, but it has no meaning. You deceive yourself. It happened the moment we met, and we will never be the same. How very young you are. I'm flattered. I admit that, too. Good night, Count Vronsky. I cannot help myself. -I'm sorry. -I ask nothing of you. I will not embarrass you. I will not importune you. I believe you. But I will not give you up. I will go where you are. I will be where you can see me. At a restaurant, at the ballet, at Betsy's house. And one day... Goodbye, Count Vronsky. I'll be waiting. Oh, my God. May I? She's my good friend. My dear Betsy, she's mine, too. I merely said that she's changed in the past few months since she came back from Moscow. Everybody has noticed it. Not I. Well, in that case, my dear, I think I should tell you. The reason for the change has just appeared. That is nonsense. Please excuse me. Betsy. Am I late, or am I early? That depends on your reason for being here. She's not here yet, hmm? I'm not sure she's coming Alexei, one hears a great deal of malicious gossip. It's empty gossip, as it happens. Is that true? Yes, it's so true, in fact, that I'm beginning to give up hope. What hope can you have? None. None whatsoever. I'm aware that half the men you see here tonight are up to something. Half the women, too, I think. Oh, I can't say that I disapprove. I've dallied once or twice myself. But Anna... Not everyone can be successfully unfaithful. Anna cannot do it. I would never hurt her, not in any way. I'm glad to hear you say that. So she did come after all. Hello, my dear. How nice to see you. Nice to see you. I've just heard that the Topov girls are getting married. Both of them. Thank you. Which reminds me, I've just had word from Moscow. News of Kitty. Really? Good news. Excuse me. Aren't you pleased? Of course I am. I hear there's a new love in her life... A country gentleman named Levin. I feel so relieved. Don't you? It means we did no harm. I came here knowing you'd be here. I've looked for you everywhere. It's been over a week. Where were you? I've scarcely left my room. Have you been ill? I had to be alone. Away from you. I have to tell you, Alexei... We've got to put an end to this. I cannot endure another day of it. What do you want from me? In all the world, the one thing I want most is peace. I don't have any. I can't give it to you. If you love me as you say... I sometimes wish that I didn't. I can't think of us apart. I've lost myself in you. All these months, I've held back. We're not... We're not two people anymore, Anna. You feel it, too. You know exactly what I mean. You are right to say that we should put an end to it. We have to be lovers, Anna, or there's nothing for us. Tell me what you want me to do. If you want me to go, I will. If you want me to leave, I will, if you wish. I can't. I can't drive you away. I don't think that I could have gone. Oh, what's to be done then? What is to be done? That's in your hands. You know I love you. And you... Oh, God! When did he come? I must go to him. Where will I see you again? When will it be? Don't ask me that. Count Vronsky. How beautiful you look. Don't let me interrupt. I'm almost done. How nice it was you came to Betsy's. I should venture out more often, I suppose. It's difficult to find the time. I'm either at the Ministry or working here or reading or preparing something. There's no end to it. How delicate the work is. All that stitching. Life is like that. Held together by a thread. Oh, don't sound so somber. It's a banal thought. I'm really quite a banal person. Anna, can we talk? That's what we're doing, isn't it? I feel I have to warn you, Anna. Warn me of what? Can your hair wait? Oh, yes, of course. The strangest thing is this... You have a life apart from me, and I never realized it before. It's right and proper. You're entitled to your ideas, your feelings... Your own desires. But, Anna, there is talk about you. Even I have heard it. I could sense it in the room tonight. I don't know what you mean. My trust in you is absolute. But your attentions to this Vronsky boy, and his to you can hurt you. Attentions? Alexei, it's all so innocent. -How can it hurt me? -It can grow. I see. You think I might deceive you. No. But you can cause yourself great pain. You have my thanks for your compassion, but I am not a child. Exactly so. You have a child. It's he who should be at the center of your thoughts. He is, more than you know. If it weren't for Seryozha... Is there anything you want to tell me? Nothing. Would you tell me if there were? Alexei, I have a conscience. I know. It's late. Let's go to bed. -I need a moment. -I'll be waiting. So this is where you live. 'Tis just as I imagined. I have it to myself now. Oh? What happened to your friend? Petritsky? I've, um... I've removed him. It seems that we were competing over everything... Who was best at this or that. Things got completely out of hand. When are you moving to the country? A week or two. Do you know that little cottage just down the road from Betsy's villa? Yes. I've taken it. I see. So... I'll be close by all summer long. I think I'd like some sherry. It's all right. We're alone. It's not all right. Alexei... Please take me home. No. I have to go. I really must. This is sin. I'll never be forgiven. Oh, God! You've never said that you love me. Oh, since we danced... You are all that matters. You own me, Alexei. Wait here. There's no one here. Seryozha's riding, and his father's in the city. I hoped you'd come. I couldn't wait till afternoon. I know. Come. Oh. Oh. I spent the whole morning at the stables. Bijou's magnificent. She's ready for the race. You're sure to be there, aren't you? Betsy's taking me. We're lunching on the grounds, I think. Of course, I've had fresh insults from that poor Petritsky. As if goading were necessary. Would I care to raise the bet to 7,000, or was it too much for me? I ask you. He infuriates you, doesn't he? My honor is at stake. Men love to talk about their honor. Are you sure what honor is? I think I know. Do you find much in the way we're living? I have never felt that you or I were in the wrong. What's wrong is staying with your husband. That's what has to change. We have to be together, Anna. There is no other choice for us, no other possibility. What's the matter? What are you thinking? Always the same thing, Alexei. What's happened? Nothing. Tell me. It's quite amusing, really, and so very commonplace. I am with child. With my child? Y... You're sure? I haven't been with him for months. It's yours and mine? Oh. Oh, Alexei. Alexei. -How long have you known? -A week or so. Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I was afraid you might be angry. Angry? It's the answer to a prayer. We have to be together now. We're free. I don't feel free. You can't stay on here with Karenin now. That's impossible. What would you have me do then? Leave him. Come away with me tonight, tomorrow. Pack your bags... Or better yet, don't pack. We'll buy new things. -It's not that simple, Alexei. -Why isn't it? He may not let me go. You are not a prisoner in his house. No. But what if he won't divorce me? Why in God's name wouldn't he? Your child would have no name. I would be disgraced. If he were vengeful, who would blame him? I've had time to think, you see. And if I run away with you, he will keep my son. He would. He truly would. It is his right. It's not so simple, Alexei. I know this much... I will not have you live like this. But... I'm not unhappy... Truly not. No matter where you are, you're with me. Like the child, I carry you inside me. But the difference is he's only in my body. Alexei, you're in my soul. I'll see you in three hours. It's no time at all. Mama! This is intolerable. Mama, where are you? Mama! Mama! Look, Mama! Look! Papa's home! Papa's home! No, I'm impressed, Alexei Aleksandrovich. You ought to be applauded. I suppose it was a victory of a sort. One does not often accomplish two reforms in the space of one week. In any event, I felt entitled to a day or two of country air. For which we are delighted. Aren't we, my dear? Yes, it's so seldom Alexei can get away. Too seldom. Ah, here they come. That's, um... What's his name again? Petritsky. Ah, yes, of course. I know his family. Ah, here's our hero. We must wish him luck, my dear. Oh. Excuse me. We've come to say bonne chance, Count Vronsky. That's very kind of you. And what a splendid mount you have. I say so knowing little of the subject, but one cannot miss the beauty of her lines. There is no substitute for temperament and breeding, is there? None. She's very fine. My wife has told me something of the background of the race. This man Petritsky has become your enemy, I take it. A rival perhaps. Hardly an enemy. I can understand your feelings. At the Ministry, I must spend half my life dealing with enemies. Sometimes revenge comes slowly, but it always comes. We wish you great good fortune, do we not, my dear? Indeed we do. Our hopes go with you. You seem a little distracted, Alexei. Perhaps the stakes are too high for you. No, not for me. Would you care to raise them? If you like. I have to warn you, Petritsky, I don't plan to come in second. Nor do I. 10,000? -Done. -Right. Which of the two do you favor, General? Go on! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Go on! Come on... Come on. Go on! Go on! Come on, Bijou. He's... He's winning! Go on! Go on! Come on! Ah! Go on. Go on. Go on! Oh, my God. What's happened? Oh. Oh, I must go to him. You can't. He needs me. Stop this instantly, do you hear me? The winner! The winner! Oh! Oh, God, what have I done? Are you all right? She's broken her back. All right. What a dreadful accident. I'm sorry you were here to see it. I should take you home. So soon? There's no need. Even so. Shouldn't we say something to Count Vronsky? I'm quite sure he knows our feelings. Alexei, I really must. Another time. It's gotta be done, you know. No. Let me. How beautiful she is. I rode her too hard. I asked too much of her. Of course, it wasn't my idea, you understand. Mikhail insisted. Though his duties as a secretary don't require it, he frets about me. So I saw the Doctor yesterday. Do you know what the foolish fellow said? No. I need rest. I work too hard. I should relax, travel, go to Bath and take the waters. As if such a thing were possible. Have you heard anything I've said? I always listen when you speak. Then I must tell you I consider your behavior unbecoming. What behavior, may I ask? You were all too obviously concerned about Count Vronsky. It was evident to everyone. You don't deny it, do you? What you see is your perception. How can I deny it? What you do in public is of great concern to me. Harms us both. -And what I do in private? -Anna... I am a man who has no friends. It's not because I'm altogether charmless. I have no need of friends. I have my work and I have you. That's quite enough. I almost wish it were. I have no life apart from you. When we met... When I first met you... I was living in the country with my aunt. You were the Governor. I had no money and no prospects... Not to speak of. You were 42 and lonely. And I was young. You've given me a fine home... And a lovely son, but, Alexei, I have no husband. Let me finish! -I cannot go on. -I've heard enough. I tried to warn you what might happen. You have duties. You have obligations. There are principles of conduct. What you feel for Vronsky is your own affair. How you act is not. -You must control your feelings! -I can't! You may not see him in the future. I forbid it. It's no use. I hear you speaking, I can see you, but he's all I think about. -I love him. -I was sure of it. -I knew it. -Well, then, know it all. I am his mistress. It has been so for months. -For months. -There's nothing I can do about it. I cannot control myself. When I see him, I feel... It's kind of you to be so explicit. -Let me go on. -For God's sake, spare me the details. I am carrying his child. That is everything. You know it all. I am not ashamed. Do with me as you like. I will, but there are many elements involved. I must consider what is to be done. -One day you must tell me how you do that. -All it takes is skill. Just as I feared. The only rule I know is always have her for a partner. -Which he does. -How are you, darling? Very well. Alexei Aleksandrovich sends regrets. He had to go back to town. Well, I'll see you both after the game. -Betsy's turn goes on forever. -Run along. How beautiful the day is. -It's so lovely here. -I hoped you'd come. I looked for you yesterday after the race. I couldn't stay. I was so frightened when you fell. I longed to come to you. -For all I knew, I thought I'd lost you. -Never. -Shall we watch? -No. No. I have to say, when I saw your husband yesterday... -I find him difficult to read. -You do? So I kept going over what he said, all that about revenge and enemies. Do you think he knows? Indeed, I do. In fact, I've had a conversation with him. In the carriage on the way back from the race. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. He disapproved of my behavior. Found it unbecoming, that was his word. He said some cruel things. I said some cruel things. Suddenly I found myself... I told him, Alexei. I told him we were lovers. It's what you wanted, isn't it? You're pleased, aren't you? Yes. Absolutely. It's important that he knows the truth. But I should have been the one to tell him. It can't have been a pleasant scene. Not very. What is he going to do? What did he tell you? At that moment, he... He didn't know. He had to sleep on it. He's terribly methodical. -That's not to say he isn't clever. Just that... -Anna, for the love of God. I'm sorry, but late this morning, just before he went to town, he... -He wants to keep me. -What? He will not let me go. He won't. I think he thinks he loves me. I don't know. Perhaps he hopes all this will pass. And when it doesn't, what then? Will he lock you in the house? But he knows he cannot keep me from you. He permits it. He consents to that. How can he? I don't know. But all he wants, all he demands is that you never come to me. You're not to set foot in his house. And there's to be no scandal, Alexei. If we're careful, if we take care, we can go on just as we have. No, we can't, and you know it. What about our child? You told him about that, didn't you? What did he say to that? He doesn't care. It doesn't... It doesn't matter to him. That's impossible. He's got to care. Why should he? Everyone will think it's his. Appearance is all he cares about, his reputation, his career. I'll go to him. I'll have it out with him. -No! No. -Why not? The man is ruining our life. -Why should we live on his terms? Why... -Don't. -Who is he to say? -Don't do that. I can't give up my son. He's going to take him if I go with you. He told me so. I'm not ashamed to live with you, Alexei. Let people call me what they like, but I can't lose my son. Don't ask it of me. I haven't got the strength. I can't. What's to be done, then? How are we to live? -Together, as we have. -That's ridiculous. We're not together. How in God's name can we possibly go on? You wouldn't leave me, would you? I can't leave you. Don't you know that? But I tell you, Anna, this will tear us apart. Your husband is a very clever man. This is the way he deals with his enemies. Alexei! I won't be long. I came as quickly as I could. -Are you all right? -Oh, you're here. -Of course I'm here. Your note said you were ill. -I am, a little. The Doctor says I can't go out, and you're not allowed to come to me. I had to find a way to see you. I came here thinking God knows what. Anna, you know I shouldn't be here. Karenin's at the Ministry for a meeting. He'll be gone a few hours. Oh, Alexei, I've missed you so. I know. How are you feeling? Well enough. Mmm. You really do have a fever. Well, now and then. It comes and goes. -What's the Doctor say? -Oh, the Doctor mumbles. &quot;Stay at home. Do this, do that.&quot; And all those stupid medicines! It's you I need. I want to hear what you've been doing, everything. Some other time. It's... It's not important. -Don't you want to tell me? -No, of course I do, but I have no business being here. I've only come because of your note. Had enough of me so quickly? - Have I bored you? - Anna, you know better than that. No, I don't. I don't know anything. I'm trapped here, and you're free to go and do. God only knows what you've been doing, who you've been with. Anna. Anna! I've never lied to you. There's nothing for you to be jealous of. You have no reason. No, I... I'm not jealous, really. Truly not. And I believe you. I believe you. When you are here, I trust you absolutely. It's when you're away I think such dreadful things. I just... One day, we will be together all the time. Yes, we will. Karenin will release you, and Seryozha, too. I don't know how he bares it. How can he look at you and let this thing go on? I don't know. Who could keep me after what I've done? - In his place I'd have thrown me out in the street. It doesn't matter anyway. A few more weeks and I will be free. You, too. We shall all be at peace. I feel so glad of it. The child will come, you see. -But I will not live through it. -What haven't you told me? -What's the Doctor said? -I will not survive. I shall be dead. I've dreamt it. I believe in dreams, I do. It was so terrible. There was a storm outside and I was in my bedroom. There was something in the corner. -Anna, this is nonsense. You must not... -The something turned. A peasant. Dreadful-looking. With a twisted beard. And then... -Oh! -The meeting ended early, so I... Came directly home. -Alexei Aleksandrovich. -Good evening. Is there anything you need just now, my dear? In that event, I'll... I'd like a word with you before you go. -Well, sir... -I take full responsibility for being in your home. That's very fine of you. I have violated our arrangement. I should not have come. If that were all you'd violated... Good God, man, have you no limits? I have closed my eyes. I've let her come to you. -I have condoned... -How can you stand it? It is my child. I think of it as Anna's child, as if she'd been assaulted by some criminal. She has no love for you. -If you had any feelings for her... -Any feelings? You have covered her with shame. You have destroyed her home. She suffers. Can't you see that? Let her go, then. Let her take her child and come to me. You are the reason she suffers. You are the cause. Then challenge me. Attack me. Meet me on the field! Oh... I fail to see how getting shot at gives my wife her honor back. Nor do I see why I should put my life at risk because you are a scoundrel. Am I? What's my crime? I offer her my title, wealth, position, love and respect. I have never wanted this... Lunatic and appalling situation. -Months ago, you should have set her free. -She loved me once. She will again, I know it. She is a prisoner in your house. That is all she will ever be. She's mine. She stays with me. You'll never have her. -You don't have her either. Can't you see that? -Vronsky, I must tell you. You are a shallow, ignorant, deceitful man. I don't care what it costs, or what the scandal. I will keep her from you. You will not see her again. I swear to God. I have nothing more to say to you. You know the way out. Ah, Stiva. I trust you had a good journey, sir. Oh. Very cold. His Excellency will be with you in one moment. -Alexei Aleksandrovich. -How good of you to come. -You must be frozen from your journey. -Oh... Hungry, too. Your telegram was so unclear. It said so little. How is Anna? She... Her labor started yesterday... Late yesterday. It was a long delivery, but successful. -She has had a daughter. -Oh, how wonderful! A little girl! Champagne all around, I say! You must be very proud. Congratulations. Thank you. Now Seryozha has a sister. Is he pleased? Yes. Very. And, uh, how is Anna doing? There have been some complications, I'm afraid. In fact, I have to tell you, Stiva, -she has childbed fever. -Oh, dear Lord. Uh, how bad is it? I mean, I get fevers. Fevers break. Not this one, I'm afraid. It's nearly always fatal. Stiva... Where's the Doctor? I want to see him. Is he here? -Of course. -I want to see him. What's he doing for her? -Very little. -Very little? Very little? For the love of God, man! You mean to say she's dying? - How... How long? - Another day or two perhaps. May we see her? Water. Swallow. Good girl. Good girl. -Was that the morphine? -Yes. Oh, good. -You should have some broth, you know. -I know. -You've taken nothing since the birth. -I can't. I've just been to see your daughter. Doing splendidly, she is. As sound and healthy as they come. I'd like to see her. I wish... Oh, I wish... I wish I could feed her. When you're better. Stiva! Oh, I'm so glad. Oh, Dolly. Oh. Here. Come close. I've missed you so. Well, the way you look, we've come for nothing. What's all this I hear about a fever, hmm? It's not catching. You can kiss me. -Have you seen my little girl? -Not yet. She doesn't have a name, poor thing. I don't know what to call her. Never mind. What matters is you're here. You've come in time, before I... Look at them. Forever putting on their cheerful faces. Come, you'll be well in no time. You shall have visitors at Easter. Stiva, please. I know that I'm dying. And I beg you to believe. I have done such dreadful things. -Unspeakable... -No, no. It's true. Ask him. Alexei, can you forgive me? You should rest now. -Could you find it in your heart? -We'll have a long talk later. Now! While I still can! Don't let me die like this, with so much on my soul! Oh, God, Alexei. Oh, you must hate me. I don't. I never did. I've loved another man. I've borne his child. Another Anna did these things. Some second person, somebody else. Can you forgive me for my sins? I always knew. I knew you'd come back if I waited. Say the words. I want to hear them. -I forgive you. -Oh, thank you. Thank you. You're so good. You are so good to me. My little girl. What's to become of her? I'll bring her up. I'll raise her. Could you love her, do you think? And what about her father? -She need never know. -I want to see him, Alexei. You want him here? I've given him such pain. He suffers just as much as you do, Alexei. Don't ask it of me. -I could die in peace then. -Anna, please! Oh, I love you, but I love him, too. I want to see him one last time. You won't deny me that. I beg you. Ask me any other thing. -I can't share you with him. Not again. -Don't let me die like this. I will not have your lover here. I'm not to see him? Ever? Never? Oh, dear God! Oh, I want to live. I want to live. I will. I swear it! I will get out of this bed. I will leave this room. I will leave this house. I will be his. I will have him! I love him. I... I will not die! I won't! I won't! Would you like your tea now? Come on, then. There's a good girl. Ah, yes. Uh, to the left a little bit more. Good. Good. Look and see what Annie's got. -Not now, Annushka. They're arriving any moment. -This is important. See? -Her first tooth. -Why, so it is. What a clever little girl you are. Make sure you're dressed and ready for Stiva and Dolly. I came to say... Oh, how good you feel. -I came to thank you. -Why? What for? Oh, I don't know. It'll come to me. I am so glad Dolly and Stiva are coming. It was right of you to make me ask them. It's been such a long time since we had visitors. -Exciting having company. -I thought it might be. I've been tyrannizing the servants. I want everything to be perfect. Why should pride be such a sin? I've never understood. Oh, Annie's produced a tooth. She has? Which one? Where is it? Ah! Oh, it's an occasion. Mmm! And what should I bring her back from Kashin? You're not still going, are you? Yes. Yes, in the morning. Must you? Well, it's a meeting of landowners, Anna. I... I should be there, don't you think? I'll only be gone two days, and you won't even miss me. You've got Dolly here, and Stiva. And I'm not leaving you alone. I know, I know. And I'll be fine. We'll get on splendidly. And you'll be back before I know it. Only, Alexei, it's just that every moment that we are apart, I feel as if... I sometimes think that God is being too good to me. It frightens me. I have everything I want, exactly as I want it. We see no one, we go nowhere, but it's heaven. There's nothing in the way I used to live that calls to me. I want it to go on, do you understand? It can go on forever, can't it? Oh, I think they're here. Oh. I've asked the grooms to bring up a couple of horses. -I thought you might like to see the grounds. -Oh! I'd like that very much. -More tea, Dolly? -I couldn't. -Would you like to rest a little? -Goodness, no. Oh, Anna, everything is so beautiful. What can I show you first? What would you like to see? Where's Annie? Oh, she's waiting for you. Come. - We won't be riding long. We'll be with you shortly. Mmm. -Oh. It's this way, Stiva, if you'd like to change. -Oh. It's no wonder Anna loves it here. -She's very happy. One can't miss it. -Yes, I know. Well, did you do it? Have you seen Karenin? Yes, in Petersburg three days ago. Well, what did he say? What's the position? I'm not sure. He hasn't had an easy time of it. One minute, he'll be reasonable enough... - Will he divorce her, yes or no? I couldn't get an answer out of him. What does he want? He has to let her go. Well, I think he might if properly approached. Perhaps if Anna went to see him. She won't see him, she won't write him. She won't even talk to me about it. Now, I tell you, Stiva, she refuses to discuss it. She won't deal with anything. There must be a divorce. I want to marry her. I want my child to have my name. I want a son. I want us to get on with our lives. You know, I try to make her face these things. She won't. She weeps, turns away, leaves the room. I tell you something, Stiva, she won't confront... -Here, look at this. -Hmm? That reached me yesterday. I'm on extended leave, you know. They want me back. Mmm. With a promotion. And a post. I'd be the commander of a province. It's a tremendous opportunity. It's a turning point. It opens everything. Well, that's wonderful. What splendid news. I know. Oh. This one's yours. The only question is, you see, I don't know what to do. -I feel so trapped here. -Ha! I don't understand you. What's the matter? -Anna doesn't know. I haven't told her yet. -Why on earth not? -She'd be thrilled. -Stiva, look, I've got two days of meetings in Kashin. I'm leaving in the morning. She's got you and Dolly here, and yet she begs me not to go. She wants me with her every minute. I mean, if there's a problem in the fields and I'm needed, if I go off for half a day, she can't bear it. Well, my dear chap, she's in love with you. No, it's more than that. I feel like I'm stifling here. I... I feel that I can't breathe. She's perfectly happy. She'd stay here forever. But I can't. I have to do something with my life. She has to know that, Alexei. You have to tell her. -Someday. -No, now. This post won't wait. You know you have to accept it, don't you? You'll never forgive her if you don't. No, no, she'll understand. She's very wise. She helped me save my marriage once, you know? -Shall we go back? -Go back? You were right, of course. It's wonderful to have them here. We should invite people down more often. Well, of course we should, dear. We could ask the, um, Tverskayas and the Manikoffs. -They'd get along together splendidly, don't you think? -Let's do it soon. I'll write to Betsy in the morning. You still going to Kashin tomorrow? Oh, I don't know. It's not important. I don't mind. I truly don't. I don't know why I carried on. It seemed to matter at the time. It doesn't anymore. -What's this? -I left that for you to see. It's from the army. Oh? What does it say? They want me back. I see. They're offering me a rise in rank. -What would you be? -A colonel. Colonel Vronsky. A post comes with it. I would be the senior officer of Kazakhstan. Oh, imagine that. May I have some water, please? It's my morphine. It's only now and then. They help me. I wish you wouldn't. It's a small price to pay for a little peace. I don't have much of that. I know. You miss your son. Not when you're here. Truly not. You are why I lived. I would've died except for you. Alexei, I know you love me. Every time you leave the room, I think, &quot;He's gone. He's never coming back.&quot; I always will. I know that, too. It doesn't help. We can't live here forever, can we? No. I can't go on pretending there's no world outside. -I have to face things, don't I? -Yes. -When you're ready to. -Of course. When are you taking up your post? Well, I haven't said that I would. You have to go. I understand. - You'll be a general. You'll command an army. Don't you know I'm proud of you? I want it for you. How can I be happy if you're not? How can I? Uh... Here. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm fine. Why isn't love enough? I'll never leave you, Anna. I can't be without you either. Will we be together always? Oh, you are so good to me. I'll go wherever you go. I'll do anything, see anyone. Whatever life you want, I'll... I'll lead it with you, Alexei. Philippe is seven-and-a-half years old. -Each morning... -Every morning. It's not fair when one word means two things. It's not a bit fair, but they do. You're doing very well, you know. I'm proud of you. -Can I go out and play now? -It's a fine day. In a little while. Please go on. I can tell Alexei Aleksandrovich you're here, - but I'm not sure he'll see you. It's very important. I won't keep him long. -Has he been well? -Yes. And Seryozha, is he here? No. I don't believe so. Oh, Mikhail, if I could just see him for a moment, just to look at him. -I'm sorry, but we have clear instructions... -What are you doing here? I must talk with you. I'd hoped never to see you again. Shall we go to your study? Well? How is Seryozha? -Has his health been good? -Mmm-hmm. -And you? -I'm as you see. What brings you here? We're closing Alexei's apartment. We shall be in Moscow for a while. -That can't be what brought you here. -No. I'm at your service, Anna Arkadyevna. What can I still have that you still want? -I want my freedom. -Freedom? Who can be more free than you? I can't think what you haven't done. -You've made a cuckold out of me. -Stop it, Alexei. I've stopped. I must have... You must give me a divorce. Why must I? Does your lover want to marry you? Then you must tell me how I benefit. Will I be happier when you are Countess Vronsky? Dear God! You still want me, do you? Goodness, no. -Then let me out of this. -My dear, have you considered what my life has been like? Have you stopped to wonder how I feel? I have no friends to turn to. My colleagues take me for a fool. They snicker when I leave the room. I know it. I don't have to hear them. I was willing to pretend that my wife's lover's child was mine. They find that ludicrous. -They think I'm... -Alexei, I'm sorry. -So am I. -I never meant for all this to happen. If you've finished, you can go. Divorce me! For the love of God! You have my son. -How much more do you want? -The boy is mine. I am still your wife. I have some rights. I'll fight you for him. Think of all the scandal, days in court. I wonder if you'd really do that. Press me to the wall and you'll see. I'll make a bargain with you, Anna Arkadyevna. I will let you go, but you must promise not to see Seryozha in the future. Ever. Under any circumstances. You can't ask me that. Then we have nothing more to say. You'll give him up? I have your word? -You have it. -I will so instruct my lawyers. Mama! -Seryozha! -It's you, Mama! -It's you! You've been away so long. -I know. Where did you go? How could you leave me? Oh, my baby, I've missed you so. Have you come home, Mama? Have you come back? Seryozha, you may go now. But, Papa. Your mother has to leave. I've so much to tell you. Can't you stay? Remember that I love you. Run along now. Yes, Papa. I've lost my son forever, haven't I? Seryozha. Ooh, look at you. Don't you look pretty? We're going for a stroll, madam. Oh, that's nice. Have a good time. Oh. Oh. - When you get back... When you get back... When you get back... Yes, when you get back, we'll get some nice hot chocolate, huh? Come on. Annushka, I was coming to find you. There was something. Oh, Lord! The grayness here in Moscow. It's enough to... Oh, yes, yes. -Has my medicine arrived? -This morning. And you didn't tell me? May I have it, please? Count Vronsky has it. Oh? He does? He's changed so much. You must have noticed how he's changed. No. He's so remote. He goes out. He knows I can't. He leaves me here, and then he comes late. He must be home now. He should be home now. Dear, it's just past 3:00. That's all it is. What do you think he's doing? He keeps secrets now, you know. He wants a post in government just like Karenin, but he won't admit it. Men are like that... Always up to something. -Do you think I'm losing him? -Oh, goodness sake. The way you talk. Oh, I know. I listen to myself sometimes. Do you know last night before we went to bed, he said... I get so sharp with him these days. It's bad of me. I get so angry, and I say such dreadful things. I don't know where they come from, and I feel so sorry afterwards. He always forgives me. I think that's him. Annushka, am I all right? Yes. He mustn't find me here. You, go, go that way. Quickly. If he comes in, it means he loves me. -Thank you, Josif. -Thank you, sir. Oh, you've come home! Yes. Here I am. I've missed you. You look lovely. -Did you have a good time? Was it nice? -Oh, it was all right. The way lunches go. -Tipolsky asked about you. -Oh, he did? What did he say about me? Nothing much. He just wished you'd come. You know I can't go out. Anna... My friends have abandoned me. People think such things about me. No, they don't. It's in your mind. Anyway, I'm sorry that I was late. I had to stop and see the lawyers. -Oh. -Yes, we're waiting for some papers from Karenin's lawyers. -There's no problem. It just takes forever. -I don't mind. I don't care if the papers never come. I do. I want to marry you, Anna. I know you say so. Well, how's your day been? Oh... -Quiet. -Oh, yes? What have you been doing? Oh, I wrote some letters and, um, fussed about the house. And I sent Grisha to the pharmacist about my medicine. It never came. It must be lost, because they said they sent it. -Annushka gave it to me. -Why? Whatever for? -Because I asked her to. -May I have it, please? No. It doesn't do you any good, Anna. I'll be the judge of that. I'd like it. Where is my medicine? I've sent it back. You had no right. What am I? A prisoner here? You go off, the house is empty. Everything is so empty. -Have you got another woman, Alexei, have you? -Of course not. Would you tell me? That's a question. How am I to know? Because I love you. That's why. I try hard to look the way you like me. Is my hair all right? Sometimes I can't remember if I've brushed it. Oh, swear to me there's not another woman. Will you stop this? I have no one! Your love is everything to me, Alexei. If you stopped loving me, I would die. It's in your eyes. I can see it. You can't wait to leave me. Oh, my God. -Oh, my God! -One day, I swear, you'll drive me to it. No! What am I saying? What am I doing? I'm so sorry, Alexei. I'm so sorry. I don't know what's wrong. I don't know what to do. Hold on. Hold on. It's all right. I'm with you. I'm with you. I'm so unhappy here. That's what it is. Can we just leave Moscow? -Can we just go away? -Of course. Could we? Could we... Could we go back to the country? I'd feel better there. I know I would. Just for a while, a month or two. Well, as long as you'd like. -Do you mean it? -Mmm. Oh, dear Lord, you're so good to me. - When can we go? - Whenever you say. -Tomorrow. Can we go tomorrow? -Tomorrow? I don't know about tomorrow. -Oh, please. Oh, please. Please. -No... I've got some business things to attend to. I have to cancel engagements. Mother's got some letters for me to sign and take to the lawyers. I've got a meeting in the morning. All right. All right, absolutely. Yes, we can do it. -Late tomorrow, all right? You go and pack. -Oh, I will, I will. -Alexei, where are you going? -Well, Mother's in the country with the Markofs. Now, if I make the next train... Let me see, it's two hours to Obiralovka, it's half an hour to the station, and, um... The last train to Moscow leaves at 10:00. So I'll... I'll make that. -I'll be on the train. -Oh, hurry back. I'll miss you. I don't want to be alone. I love you. Mmm. go. Go. Go! Go! Go. Oh, I have to pack! Annushka! I'd like those in the black case. No, the brown case. No, dear. Those are summer clothes. I shan't be needing them. -Is Annie home yet? -Yes, ma'am. -Shouldn't someone be packing her? -They are, ma'am. -Olga is with the nanny. -Oh, good. -Annushka, have you seen my... -It's one thing at a time. Why the rush I don't know. There's a whole household here ready to pack and send things off to you. It's not the same. Oh, good. Thank you, Grisha. Put them anywhere. Yes, madam. The Princess Oblonskaya has just arrived, madam. Oh, good God. Darn it, I forgot. How could you let me? Well, she... She won't mind this. Send her up. Yes, madam. We'll take our tea in here. I'll need you later on. Oh, Annushka. It's so exciting, isn't it? I'm so happy. Good heavens, Anna. -What's all this? -We're leaving for the country. How you people bear it here I cannot imagine. Come and help. I will. -Come. Annushka... -But first, see who I brought. Anna Arkadyevna. Oh! It's been two whole years. I'm married now. You know that, don't you? Yes, of course. -To... To Levin. Kostya Levin. -Yes. Oh, Anna, you must meet him. We so rarely come to town. He loves the country. So do I. -Did Dolly ever tell you? -Tell me what? I felt so dreadful, so ashamed. I knew what hopes you had of Alexei. -He wasn't really yours, but even so. -That doesn't matter anymore. Dolly's told me how beautiful your home is. Levin's property is large like Alexei's. But where we live, the house itself is very simple. One day you must come and visit. -Alexei would like that. -Oh, I'm sure he would. We'd dearly love to see him. Well, he's, um, with his mother I'm afraid. Will he be back soon? Not till late. -They're staying in the country with the Markofs. -Oh! I've been there many times. Tatiana Markof is a friend of mine. We went to school together. Did you ever meet her? -I don't think so. -You'd remember her. She has this pale blond hair. It's absolutely flaxen. - And deep blue eyes. Oh, yes, of course. She was so beautiful. Whatever happened to her? She never married. Why, I can't imagine. I mean, here I am, a married woman, and she's still at home with no one. She sounds lovely. Dolly, would you mind if... All this came about so suddenly, and I forgot I must go out. You understand. I'm sorry. You must stay and have tea. Annushka! Don't just stand there. Come along. Come along. And, Kitty, you must see my little girl. Excuse me. -Come on. Come on, Annushka. -I'm here. -Peter, take us to the Nizhegorod station. -Yes, madam. Quickly. Come on, Annushka. -Going to Obiralovka? -We have to see Count Vronsky as soon as possible. I see it all. He's so transparent. He's so obvious. How quick he was to go. How eagerly he went away. You must have seen it, too. Oh, no, of course not. You weren't there. What papers can his mother have? He is leaving me, Annushka. I'm sure you're wrong. He won't leave you. It's all over. It's been all over for a long time. This Tatiana girl means nothing. I'm not jealous. My dear, you have no need to be. He'll leave her, too. That's what men do. They go away. In the beginning, when he loved me, I was something he was proud of, a possession. As you know, he's riddled with ambition, driven by it. Now I'm useless to him. He's ashamed of me. I stay at home for his sake. I'd go out. Why not? What have I done to be ashamed of? I will tell him we are finished. I will tell him we are finished, to his face. Yes, it should come from me. He's not without some honor. He might even say he loves me. He might beg me not to go. Why, in time, he might even marry me. He feels a debt, you see. But any life together would be torture. That's what I must tell him. He will try to keep me, I have no doubt. But I will leave him, leave him there and... Where will we go, Annushka? Oh, back to town. Of course. But back home... I can't go there again. The question we must face must be practical and clear. I am a woman. I am a woman... Who's lost two men, destroyed a son, and has a daughter whom she doesn't. Oh, dear God, Annushka. What am I to do? The Lord will provide. You're still my little one, you know. Annushka will look after you. Khimki next. All passengers for Khimki. What a life, announcing towns. What lives they all have. No one asked if I minded smoking. I don't mind that. Why do they go on living? Do they ever stop to think? I doubt it. Look at them. Annushka, do you ever stop and think how they look without their clothes on? That one for example. Look at him. 10:00. If we're not there by 10:00, we'll miss Alexei. Is that us? Do you think it's us? - No. I wish I'd brought a book. I'm fond of English novels. Lords and Ladies. Gothic Ruins. What a silly business love is. I should know. That's so strange. It wasn't here, but it was like this. When he followed me from Moscow. Do you remember, Annushka? The compartment was so hot, and I went out to get fresh air and what he said was... &quot;I have come to be where you are.&quot; He should be here soon. He may be here already. Go and look for him that way. Go. I'll go this way. Oh, dear God! He was in my dream. Oh, I don't want to see him. I can't face him. There's no... Point. There's nothing left to say. Is there anyone I haven't hurt? Dear Lord... It's all so simple. May God keep both my Alexeis and both my children. Wait, sir! Oh, please! Please wait! Oh, please help. -Annushka, what on earth? -Thank God you're here, sir. She's come out to see you, and she makes no sense. No sense at all. -I can't understand a word. She's... She's this way, sir. -What? Peace, it's all I ever wanted, isn't it? Where is she? Sir. Anna! Anna!
