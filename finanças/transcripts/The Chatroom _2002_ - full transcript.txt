(chuckling) - Would you like something to drink with that? - A small Diet Coke. What, dude? I'm on a diet. - They got you right, that's right, they got you right. Aye, I saw what was going on back there. - What? - Yeah, "What?" What? That waitress Wendy digging on you, that's what. - Man, that girl is a ding bat. She couldn't pour piss outta boot with the directions on the bottom. - I'm sorry, y'all, I had to get a doggy bag. - A doggy bag? Now, how in the hell you get a doggy bag and you ain't have shit left on your plate to eat? - I ordered it.

Since y'all never played I just thought you guys were just three niggas who always had front row seats. - Ah, yackety, yackety, yack. What brings you back to the hood? I heard you was a big time asshole in Texas. - Nope, I'm a big time dentist in Texas, get it right. And besides, I'm back in town for the 10 year reunion. - Oh, that's right, it's this Saturday. - Remember the bet the four of us made with Crazy Larry? - The one about who would sleep with Principal Patterson first? Man, she gotta be well into her 50s now. - Yeah, but I bet that ass still look good though. Shit, I'll tap it. - Man, you'd tap anything that'd open they legs for you. - Look, look, I'm talking about the wager the five of us made, the one who will bring the baddest date, girlfriend, or wife to the 10 year reunion. - Oh, I remember that. Yeah, because everybody on the team was supposed to vote on the winner, right? And everybody put in like $5. Pot turned out to be something like 50 bucks. - Yeah, remember we gave it to Stanley to hold 'cause his nerdy ass was the most trustworthy? - Fellas, fellas, is the bet still on? - Man, we all grown ass men now. Ain't nobody trying to partake in your juvenile, immature, kiddie games. To be in on that bet is just plain stupid. - All right, all right, well suit yourself. But that pot that was $50, turned into 50,000. - Like I done said, winning this bet isn't everything. It's the only thing! Hell yeah.

We gotta formulate a plan to get this money! - Yeah, that's amazing how Stanley flipped it from $50 to $50,000. - I know, man, he must've been invested in something that just blew up over the past 10 years. - Yeah, like your ass, nigga. - Nigga, I'm sick of you! - Aye, aye, aye, come on, man, come on, man, cut that shit out. We gotta get this dough. (neck cracking) Now I just got off the phone with the nigga mama, and apparently him started an internet company that he invested the money in. - They must be selling something that's really in demand, like porn. That's it, they selling sex films. - Uh-uh, it's bigger than that. They selling authentic horse hair. - [Both] Oh. (upbeat music) - Weaves have been hot over the last 10 years. - We gotta formulate a plan to get this money. Now I'm thinking we all stick together. That way, if one of us wins, we split the money three ways. That way, we got a three out of four chance in winning. - Okay. - Three outta five, don't forget about Crazy Larry. - That's the thing, I don't even think that fool will show up. You remember all them crazy dares and stunts he used to do back in high school. - Yeah, that's the reason why we called him Crazy Larry. - Apparently, that fool became a professional daredevil, an he had an accident. Now he got fifth degree burns all over his body. - Damn, what'd he do, walk on fire? - Nah man, that's the amateur stuff. It had to be something far more advanced than that, like, he ate some fire! Mm-hmm, shit went wrong and his face and body just blew away, bloosh! - Mm-mm, nigga fell asleep smoking weed, burned the whole house down, he barely survived. - [Both] Oh. - Now look, we gotta focus, man. And figure out how we gonna find the perfect date! I'm talking about a dimepiece. - We could buy a girl, them be some bad ass girls walking the streets of Figurehoa. - How you know? - Well, that's what I had heard. - Man, we got barely $250 between the three of us. That ain't enough to buy nobody who's gonna win us that cash! - Nope, but it's enough for us to get some good ass head though. (laughing) - You know what I'm saying? - Hey, come on man, cut that shit out, man. This is serious business, I need that money! A, because I'm about to be evicted from my apartment. And B, because I've got my eyes on some fresh rims and tires that I wanna purchase. - Rims? You ain't got no car. Nigga, you travel by a bike! - Aye, don't worry about how I be getting around. - I got it. We can go on one of them dating shows. Bachelor one, two, and three. - No, man, that's too public, can't be having my business all out in the streets like that. There's got to be an easier way, man. We just need to concentrate and think!

(Max screaming) - [Peaches] But, you know, so with everything that's going wrong in my life, I don't think I have problems. I like to think of them as situations. Yeah, situations, like that. - Is that your titties or your stomach sitting up on the table? (Peaches laughing) - Drew, you just too funny. Ooh, that looks good. - Okay, is there anything else I can get for y'all? - What y'all got for dessert? - All we have available right now, I think, is peach cobbler. - Peach cobbler, oh, peach cob, I would love me some peach cobbler. Can you make sure it's a big piece with a whole bunch of peaches. And lots, and lots, and lots of whip cream, okay? (laughing) - I'll take care of you, girl. - Thank you. So, like I was saying. (soft piano music) (burping) - Pardon me, that was so outta character for me. Believe it when I tell you, I know how to conduct myself, I am a lady all the time. Hurry up and get me another goddamn martini before we I get straight again in here! You know, I'm going to keep on drinking 'til I get slutty drunk tonight. So, if you wanna take advantage of me, you can. Did you hear that black and white are good together this year? (soft piano music continues) (Max clearing throat) Oh good, nice and tender! I ain't even gonna need my teeth to eat this. - Thanks for dinner, Drew. - That's all right now, wasn't my credit card anyway. - What'd you say? - Nothing. - So, you want a sister to come in or what? - You can't fit through the doorway, that's why we had to go out for dinner, remember? - Oh, yeah. - Okay. - Well, then give Peaches some good night tongue. (Drew whimpering) - I got scoliosis! - That's not contagious! - And mono. - That's curable. - My rule is I don't kiss on the first date. - Well, rules are made to be broken. - Look Peaches, I really, really would appreciate it if you would respect my wishes, okay? - Well, all right. I'll settle for a hug then. (yelling) (Drew whimpering) (bones cracking) (dramatic music) ♪ Oh yeah ♪ - I gotta go. - You gonna call me tomorrow? - Yeah.

Get off! - No, no! No! - Get off of me! (muttering) (whimpering) - Coward. (people chatting) - Damn. Man. - Man, forget this. I'm not hooking up with no more females off the internet. - Come on, dude, the internet is our best chance at finding a female that's gonna win that bet for us! - Do you know the terror and the horror I was objected to last night? My date looked like the bearded lady from the circus, man. - She still probably looked better than my date, Peaches. My date looked like you with a wig on. - Now that's scary. - Oh, that sounds big and beautiful to me. - Try big and nasty. - I told you about calling me fat! - Come on, fellas. Now we gonna have better luck next time, we ain't got nothing to lose. - Yeah, well you shoulda seen my date last night, Peaches, she was trying to sit all in my lap. I was almost smothered, I'm talking suffocated to death. I coulda died right there on the spot. - Man, y'all need to quit whining, man. Y'all think y'all the only one who had a fucked up night? I was almost molested by a senior citizen! (crying) At one point she made me touch her. She made me massage her back and caress her sagging to the knees titties. I still smell like BENGAY. - I like older women. - You couldn't fight her off? How old was she? (Max gulping) - She was like 80, but she was strong though. - You still got her number? - [Max] Nigga, nah! - I got it, why don't we find a fine ass sister that got her shit together? Tell her about the bet, offer her a piece of the money, and let her go out with me. - Why she gotta go out with you? How come she can't go with me? - Forget that, dude. We already splitting the money three ways. We bring in a fourth person, I might not have enough money to get my rims and tires, pay my rent, and take me a trip to a island. - No, what we need to do is find a place where there's nearly like 100 half-naked hoochies running around. Like a nightclub. - Better than that, church. - Look, man, we were duped the first time around all of our dates claimed to be fine, but they were unattractive. - Man, them bitches were ugly. - [Jelly Roll] That's right. - Look, man, they got us the first time out because we ain't know no better. We was rookies, now we veterans. This time, we ain't getting duped. - Well, how we gonna make sure they telling us the truth? - Look, before we agree to go out on any dates, we make 'em download a picture first. - Now I like that. - I love it. - Let's do it! (upbeat music) (Max yelling) (clanking) - Ooh! God. Ooh. Whoa, whoa. Ooh. - Ow. - God. You all right? - Yeah. I kind of ran into the pole. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I seen that. (hip cracking) Aye, aye! - Oh, no, no, don't be alarmed, that's just my hip. It pops out of place from time to time when I fall. No, it's been happening since I was a kid. So you're out here b-balling. - Yeah, yeah, just working on my game a little bit. You never know when the Lakers might need somebody come up off the bench and back up Kobe. (laughing hysterically) - What are you? It's not funny. - Oh. So you like playing basketball, huh? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just my way I get away from everything. Take my mind off stuff just out here chillin'. - Oh, you're cold? You want to wear my sweatshirt? - No, no, no, no, no, I'm fine. I just mean chillin' as in relaxing, kicking back. - Oh, there I go again, silly me being unhip. Well, you know, I gotta go. I gotta start getting ready for work back at Ray Ray's. So... I gotta go, okay? Bye. - Eh, she's ugly. (shuddering) (hip-hop music) Yeah is this Tiana? What's up, baby? It's me, Macaroni from Afro Chat online. How you doing? Aye, you got any recent photos of yourself laying around? - Is this Chandease? What's happening? This Jelly Roll. What you mean, "Who?" Oh, oh, my bad, my bad, my screen name is Slim. Uh-huh. I met you off the internet yesterday. Yeah. Damn, you sound sexy as hell. Can a brother get a visual to match the vocals? Cool. - Please don't let this be another fat bitch, please don't let this be another fat bitch. ♪ Uh, ow ♪ - Yes! Mm-ha. (sighing) - Come on, baby, look good. Papa needs some new shoes and some rims and tires. That's what I'm talking about, God! Ooh. (lips smacking) (upbeat music continues) - This girl's skinnier than a mustard sandwich. She ain't got no meat on her ass. But she does got a pretty face though. - Yeah, so meet me here around four o'clock. - What's up? (shuddering) Better yet, I'll meet you there around four, uh-huh. - So you do, you look like your picture, right? All right, just checking. Cool then, I'll be there at four. Aight. (sighing) - Yeah, I like what I see. You remind me of a black licorice with a pretty face. (chuckling) You know that's my favorite kinda candy. Hell yeah, you can come over here. What time you talking about? Cool, I'll be waiting at my kitchen table grubbing like a anorexic Ethiopian just turned loose on an all-you-can-eat buffet, waiting for your arrival. All right, peace. - [Max] This girl better look like her picture. - Hi! You must be Max. Mm, you're even more handsome than I hoped. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute, you Tiana? - Yes, I am. - Hell nah, you perpetrating a fraud! I feel bamboozled, duped, run amuck. You gonna email me this fine ass picture of somebody else and yo janky, skanky ass show up at the door expecting me to take you out. I'm not taking you nowhere. You a mess! You look like shit on the bottom of my shoe. The ugly police need to arrest you and put you under the jail! - Oh, Max. Hi, I'm Tiana. I see you already met my mother, her name is Tiana too. (dramatic music) (Max yelling) (punch landing) - Ooh. (upbeat music) - Hey. - [Janeese] Hi. - You must be Janesse. AKA Pink Panties. - Yeah. Just call me Pink. - Okay. Let me get that for you. Here you go, sit down. - Thank you. - Ooh, alrighty. Wow, I mean, you are absolutely stunning. When God was giving out fineness you musta got in line three or four times. - Thank you for the flattery, you are so sweet. - Hey, I just tell 'em, like I see 'em, you know. And you are definitely a dimepiece. - You know, you're cute yourself. - Oh, you think so? - Yes. - I feel a love connection coming on, oh, man! (doorbell ringing) - Oh. Chandease. (dramatic music) - Hey baby, how you doing? It's me, Candice. (groaning) What? I don't look like my picture? They say it's worth 1,000 words. - Well yours is worth only one, ugly. - Quit trippin. Listen, why don't you let me up in there, it's cold as a ice tray out here. I got this shit. We can down it and get fucked up. - Whoa, is that cold medicine? - Get you high as a kite if you take it to the head, you know what I'm saying? - How'd you get here? - I took a bus. - Well take the bus home, and when you get there, take a shower, brush your teeth, and wash your ass, 'cause you stank! (door slamming) - Yeah, we could hook up tonight. Hey, but first, let me get a little sneak preview before the main attraction. Can you email me your picture? (upbeat music) Yes! Woo hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. - Hold up, I got a pain in my side. Look at you, you laughing at my jokes and everything. I love you. - Oh. - Will you marry me? - Oh. - Get outta here. You crazy. (suspenseful music) - What the hell is that? - [Star] Max? - Hey! Oh hey, Star, how you doing? - Hi. - It's good to meet you. I hope you don't mind, your roommate let me in. - Well, are you ready to go? - Yeah, but first, what the hell is that? - Oh. That is my fat from liposuction. I keep it here to remind me that I used to be fat. Yeah, I keep no food in the house, literally, so I can stay a size six. But occasionally, when I get real hungry, I like to break off a piece of this fat in the jar. It's tasty. With little hot sauce, and on a Ritz cracker, you eat it, (smacking) good. Matter o' fact, I could go for a tasty appetizer right about now. Mm-hmm. Mm. Ooh. Oh, that looks like my left ass cheek right there. Don't you want a little taste? - Oh! No, come on. Come on, no, I'm cool. - No? Oh, all right. Mm. Hmm. Well you ready to get out? You look cute. Come on boy, let's go. (singing) - All washed up and ready. (plates clanking) Excuse me, I asked for my chicken to be extra crispy! (scoffing) - Tastes extra crispy to me. - Well, still probably tastes better than liposuction off the grill. (laughing) (clearing throat) (Star screaming) - Don't you dare start eating without giving thanks to Jallah! - Don't you mean Allah? - Give me your hands. Close your eyes. Let us pray. Close your eyes! Jallah! Thank you for this source of nourishment. Thank you for the ground we walk on, the air we breathe, and the toilet we shit in. Amen! Let's eat. I hope you don't mind, but, I invited one of my friends to join us for a meal, she's nice. You'll like her. - All right, that's cool. - Max, I feel so close to you, like we've known each other for a long time. - Yeah, people often tell me, I look like Denzel Washington. You know, and they feel like they know him 'cause they done seen all his movies and stuff, so they feel like they know me too. It's a trip how that work, but it work. (chuckling) - Can I tell you a secret? - What, you spy from another country like Africa? - You gotta promise not to tell anybody. 'Cause only a handful of people know this. - I'm not gonna say shit to nobody. - Did you ever see that movie "The Fly?" - Yeah, that was bad, Jeff Goldblum was the shit in that, but you know what I really like him in? "Jurassic Park," (screaming) all them tetradactylys. - I'm the Fly! Shh, shh. - What? (laughing and clapping) Oh, okay, I get it, you like playing a game, you a fly. All right, let me see. I'm a bumblebee. (buzzing) - I'm serious! Over the last year and a half my body's deteriorating. I am slowly but surely turning into a fly! Shh! Here comes my friend, Jupiter, she doesn't know I'm a fly. Don't say anything. Hi, Jupiter! Oh, I'm glad you could make it, girl. Here, go on over there and have a seat, mm-hmm. Girl, go on over there. (laughing) Oh. Max, this is Jupiter. Jupiter, this is Max. Max, Jupiter said, "Hi." - Am I on "Candid Camera?" 'Cause I can't afford to have my face blasted up on TV. I got warrants, you know what I'm saying? - Max, stop being rude and say hi back to my girlfriend. Max! - Hey, hi, Jupiter. - Max, go ahead and eat your food before it gets cold, Jupiter doesn't mind. Do you? No. See? (tapping on table) (gagging) (chittering) - Oh, oh, no. - So what did you think about my friend, Jupiter? She's nice, huh? - Yeah, she was cool, a little quiet, but cool. - You like Jupiter, don't you? - What? - I saw you out of the corner of my eye inappropriately staring at Jupiter. - Huh? - You were trying to flirt with Jupiter. Oh, but lucky for me, she's my one true friend and was having no part of that! - I think I should probably go now. (Star crying) - Don't leave me! (hip-hop music) I'm a high spirited woman! - Get off me! - I'm a high spirited woman, but I have a very fragile psyche. If you leave this car now I'll jump off a 13 story building. I'll drink a cup of bleach. I'll stab myself in the heart with a pocketknife. Don't go! Come back, Max, I love you! Love you, baby. Max! - Ah, you are too good to be true. Are you a masked murder? - No. - Carly Crackhead. - No. - Did you use to be a man? - No! - All right, good, then anything else I can deal with. Wait a minute, are you a stripper? - You know, maybe I should just go. - Hey, hey Pink, hold up. I mean, you get cool points for that. I mean, if you used the strip, that's all right with me. As a matter of fact, we can go on back to my place and you break me off a few lap dances, all right? (upbeat music) - All right, I'm game. Hey, I got it, this treat's on me. - I like that. Well, I'm gonna go use the bathroom and then I'll be ready to get up outta here. - [Pink] All right. - Ah, boy, I got gotta piss like a white Russian racehorse. The date I got out there, she's so fine, man, I mean, she's perfect. I'm sitting at the table, I didn't even wanna get up, 'cause I figure if I get up, I'd wake up. So I've been holding on to this for at least an hour. (sighing) Woo. (screaming) Damn! You hung like a racehorse! - I know, the water's a little cold in this urinal. - But I specifically asked you was you a man and you sad, "No." - No, you asked me if you used to be a man, and technically, I still am. (hip-hop music) So, you ready for that lap dance, baby? You ready? Ready for that lap dance, baby? Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready for that lap dance, baby? You ready? (screaming) - Hi, I'm Bob, what's your name? (scoffing) - So I looked over and this fine ass bitch has the longest dick I have ever seen. And I'm thinking she illa formed, you know, three legs or some shit like that. I look harder, and it's a goddamn dick. I mean, my nerves are rattled, man. I mean, I'm psychologically scarred behind this bullshit. That's it for me, man. No more internet hoes for me. - Look, look, look, look, man, that sounds like a really fucked up night, man. But we can give up now. The reunion's tomorrow. Now where's Jelly Roll at? - He started his job about 10 minutes ago. - Well let's go get him, man, we gotta stratetigize. - Hold up, man, now that's his J-O-B. - Fuck a job! Look, if we win this bet, we split $50,000, man. Jelly Roll don't make 10% of that a year. - All I'm saying is we can't go on his job with some bullshit, man. We'll mess around and make that man lose his job! - Come on, man, let's go. We gotta get these hoes, nigga. (upbeat music) - Man, what y'all doing up here at my job? Can't y'all see I'm working? - Man, we supposed to be strategizing on how we gonna win this bet, and then come up. - Forget about that bet, man. The reunion's tomorrow. See, you chasing a pipe dream, man. I'm out here hustling, trying to make an honest living, earning fat dough. Help for the little children. With your fine ass. - Oh, I can see how you wouldn't want to miss a day's work. All that money you'd be passing up. - It's just slow right now, but it's gonna get busy as the day goes on. Then I'll start getting silver coins instead o' copper. - We wasting our time. Now what we need to do is go home and get online. Jump in one of them chat rooms and go on as many dates today as we can. One of us is bound to find a female bad enough, physically and emotionally to take that reunion. - Every date that I've had has ended up in disaster! Do you know what showed up at my house last night, Max? A damn crack head. - Damn, did you fuck her? - Y'all go ahead, man, I don't care about that stupid bet. I don't wanna do this. - Why not? - 'Cause, man, we ain't gonna win. I was doing my jog up at the park this morning, 'cause you know, I have a workout program now, I jog a 10th of a mile on Fridays, I swim half a lap on Thursdays, and then I do about three jumping jacks on Wednesdays. - Dude, just tell me what happened at the park today. - Oh, I saw J-Ron up there with this female, man, that's tighter than tight! He's out of our league. - Listen to yourself, man. A couple o' games don't go your way and you ready to throw in the towel. Just quit when your teammates need you the most? Let me tell you something, Jelly Roll. A winner never quits, and a quitter never wins. Now ask yourself, black man, which one are you? Which one are you? Now there's still a whole lotta mackin' to be done today. Do y'all wanna go down knowing that you left your guns loaded? Or do you wanna go down knowing that you emptied your clip, shot your load, blew yo wad? - Jelly Roll. - Huh? - Do you know how many Big Macs and Krispy Kreme donuts you can get with that money? And Drew! - Huh? - Do you know how many (both panting) lap dances you can get with that money? - Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a good investment on my cash. I'm in dog, I'm in. - Me too! - Then let's go do this, fellas. 'Cause we ain't got no time to waste. (clapping) (dramatic music) Yeah, that's just what a nigga needed! - Church girl.

I'm just telling you what Jelly Roll didn't do. - You think you're gonna get away with this, don't you? You and your crazy ass cult members are going to fry for this crime. (dramatic music continues) (tape slamming) Know what that is? - A VHS tape? - You gonna love what's on it. - For real? Did you tape something off the Food Network? - What if I told you what was on that tape meant big trouble for you? What if I told you what was on this tape was you caught in the act of illegal activity? - Sir, I don't know how you got your hands on it, but when I made that porno five years ago, it was supposed to be underground only! I mean, I didn't know that pornos was against the law. All I know is that she gave me some strawtediberries. - What if I told you what was on this tape was you kidnapping a deer, dragging it to a secret location, and then violently chopping it's head off? (slamming fist) (banging table) - Then I'd say you's a goddamn lie, 'cause that shit never happened! - All right, you're right, you called my bluff. Ain't shit on that tape but old reruns of "That's My Mama." - With Ted Lange? - And Clifton Davis, and the late, great Theresa Merritt. You're free to go. - Aight, peace. Take it from another boy. (dramatic music) (tapping on table) (sighing) - Oh, two donuts and a milk. What's up fellas? Man, y'all know the reunion is tonight.

It's always about you. Max this, and Max that. You the reason why we got into that mess, always trying to convince us to continue to partake in that dumb ass bet that we didn't wanna be a part of no more. Jelly Roll and I both, man, we got caught up, man, and caught a case. Because of you, Max. - Yeah, and worse than that, I lost my appetite. - Let's be out Jelly Roll. - Come on. Just in case my appetite comes back. Fuck. (soft music) - What's up? - What's up J-Ron? - After tonight somebody's gonna have enough money to get real shiny, I'm talking bling bling.

Okay, I'm not really here exercising. I'm not gonna front, as they say. I was hoping to see you. Actually, I followed you here. - Did I forget to leave a decent tip or are you just stalking me? - Well, your tips do suck, but that's not why I'm here. I'm here because I saw how sad you looked back at Ray Ray's Diner. And, I thought since we are associates, or would we be acquaintances? Well, anyway, I don't like to see you down and out. So I got a surprise for you to cheer you up. Here, follow me. - Uh-uh. See, that sounds all sweet and everything, but, I got things to do, but I'm gonna check you out and holler at you next time I'm up at Ray Ray's. - But wait, I mean, can't you just see what, I put a lotta work and hard effort into this? You're gonna give me 10 minutes of your time. Please, I'm sorry. - All right, all right, fine, I mean, hey, 10 minutes. I thought you meant like more or something, you know, it's just 10. (soft music) You didn't have to do all this for me. - I know, but I wanted to. - Sit down, all right. Got grapes and... I'm allergic to chicken. - Oh no. - I'm just bullshitting. I love me some chicken. - Oh, you. - Chicken and rice, chicken and rice! (both laughing) Grapes and a little chicken, some potato salad. Is this some bubbly? Okay. - Mm-hmm. (soft music) (both laughing) - So Wendy, I mean, what's up? Tell me about Wendy. - Well, what you wanna know? - I'm saying, like what you wanna do with your life? I know you not trying to work at Ray Ray's forever. - Okay. Well, nobody knows this, but, I work really hard every single day at what I really wanna do. - What's that? - I wanna be a standup comedian. - Really? Well, say something funny. - Well, my jokes are kinda corny. - Go ahead, let me hear something. - What happened to the black dog when he jumped into the blue ocean? He got wet! (both laughing) - That's stupid, I mean, but it's funny though. You know what I'm saying? Tell me another one. - All right, I'll tell you one more. But after that you're gonna have to come up out the pocket to hear my jokes. - Aight. - Okay. Why was the staircase fed up? Because it was tired of being stepped on!
