Shankar what are you looking at? Nothing. I have heard that you have left your studies? Why did you leave it? It will be better if you dont ask me that. Hey guy? Am not a guy but a servant. Hey servant? Am not a guy but a servant. Hey servant? I am not your servant but your fathers servant. Did you count the saucers? Yes. How much? Its 50. Spoons? 50. Madhu? Brother. Did you read your lessons? Father told me. Mother I told him to study and he again went to the shop. He cant be blamed for that. Father told you and you have come over here. Stop. Go inside. Mother I told him to study and he again went to the shop. He cant be blamed for that. Your father asked him to go and he went over there. As the sun comes down, he is drawn to drink booze. Neither he cares about his home nor his shop. Come come, the brother of my wife. Where are you going vipin? He is going to the gutter to fall down. No, I am going to forget everything. What you want to forget? The days which are gone, the days which I am living and the days which is yet to come. Would you be able to forget it? No, this is the only problem. Ts not that easy to run away from life Vipin. This is all also right. But where there is life, there is also death coming then what would this life do? What thing a man has made? It looks like water but there is fire in this water. After fire there are flames and then its all ash. Then ultimately it becomes a coffin where people dont even use flowers to adorn it. Okay I will take a leave now. There is some money left hope she doesnt buy flowers with that for my coffin. Listen if your father wouldnt have sat in the tea shop then he would have been a poet. But he sat in this tea shop so that he could feed you all. That is all fine but.. You dont have been embrassed by this. Your father just doesnt drink booze but he drinks himself too. Aunt, Muraris mother save me. Leave my hand you butcher. Aunt, Muraris mother save me. Leave my hand you butcher. I will not leave your hand but I can leave your two months rent. Aunt.. Arent you ashamed? How dare you. Arent you ashamed? How dare you. Who asked you to become a Samaritan here. What did I do? I only saved her respect. Look at the person who is trying regain her respect. Dont beat that guy. Leave him. Beat him black and blue. Break his bones. Look at the way I have beaten him up. If you ask him his fathers name. He will take yours. I have already counted the spoons and the cups. The light has gone, the sun has set and now its my turn. The light has gone, the sun has set and now its my turn. The light bearer has come to this place of darkness. This is place of darkness and this is the place of sadness. In this desperate world, my sky lantern is the light to remove this darkness. In this earth it is the faith. Even if we are burndened by our poverty but our hope to live will always rise above in the sky. Just like my sky lantern which is like a light of this life. Its my star of my expectation. Its is like a shining light. Father. Father, its me Shankar. Come lets go home. Good that you came here. I havent told anyone about things which remains in my heart. Listen I will teach you. I too had a dream. A colourful, shining like a rainbow. But in a due time it went away. The rains disappeared. The rainbow, that seven colours disappeared one by one. And now the only thing that remains is the thought that there was once upon time a rainbow here. Seven shining colours which has gone now. Father you are gone now. After making me understand everything. I will take care of everyone. Mother, Madhu, roma. I will fulfill your dreams. Hey what are you doing? Ou dont want to sell your goods.? There is another shop over there which belongs to yasin. He will buy my goods laughingly. Then go who is stopping you. He will give you smilingly but it will be only once. Then you can cry a thousand times after that. Good day sir. What do you work as? I work for a company and on holidays I do business. What business? Selling rats. I buy old things by selling rats for a dealer. Would you like to work for me? No sir. Why? You think working in a mill is better than working for that dealer. No Sir, someday I can buy that dealers shop but the chimney of your mill is too high for me. Good day sir. Come come you, dealers of the rats. You have done which you always said. Give him your blessings. This cat has now become a lion. You can surely become one but dont drink anyoness blood. Wow! Shankar Bhandar. Shankar? Mamaji its been years that I have met you. Hello is it arvind.? You can buy 500 shares of that. Tell me Mama so what made you come over here. Just wanted to see what can a cat do after becoming a lion. You have seen it. What could I see, it seems like I am lost in this jungle. Jungle? Is this your store or its maze? Hello yes. How much shares did you get? What is the price. Okay buy 300 of those. Shankar do you ever remember about your old house? I remember about it but I dont feel like going there. Why? That home seems to be like a coffin for me where my father dreamt and died. Mother also died there sobbing all her life. But madhu doesnt think that way. This is something which I dont like. Yes come in. Mama ji you can make him understand. If he carries on selling tea, what would happen to his wife and kids? He is the one who knows maybe he thinks it as his life. A life of insects and bugs. Hello. You couldnt buy the shares even having the money? Nonsense. Listen if I dont get this shares then I wont relate myself to your company anymore. Shankar. What si this? Its gita. You can read it sometimes so that lion doesnt get blood on its mouth. This card? Yes I have sent it. You have come at this time. If your busy then I would come some other time by calling you on telephone. I have the time. You can come in. Phani. This is Mr. Shankar. Goodday. Send our the tea daughter. You wouldnt sit? I will. You seem to be in a hurry. No I was just thinking about you. I am free till the time you want. Thanks. I have come here to buy the shares of your mill. Do you know the price of the shares are dropping.? Thats the reason I have come over to you. You want to waste your money. I want to make lots of it. How would you do that? If I tell you then would you sell your shares.? No I will not,. Hence I am not telling you. You seem to be very intelligent. Come lets have a cup of tea. I think I have seen you somewhere? Yes. But when? When I used to think that the chimney of your mill was very high. You! So you even steal? Brother! What get-up is this? I won the first prize in the college function in this get-up. And you haven't changed yet? I thought she was a guy. You'll always remain a fool. Go and change. Come, uncle. Roma, see this. Brother, take these keys. I'm leaving. Wait, I want to tell you something in uncle's presence. Is it that serious? Madhu, I tried giving you an education. And even I tried my best. I want you to close your tea shop and become the manager of my general store. Do you give consent? But I am dumb. Just give me a straight yes or no. Actually, our father started that hotel. Even today, we use the same cutlery. I feel whatever money I'm making, father is giving it to me. That's not an answer to my question. Even Ramu is with me. Ramu! You'll always remain a fool. Go and change. I'm leaving. You can leave forever! Good bye. Sit uncle, where are you going? If Madhu owns a tea shop, I own a shop even smaller than his. You think I am embarrassed about Madhu owning a small tea shop? That's how it seems. You are mistaken, uncle. I only want that even Madhu prospers. Like me. I have seen that poverty turns a man into an animal. And what is the solution? Money. But after making money, we often forget that this animal also has a heart beating within him. Maybe - And maybe Madhu is happier than you in his own small world. What happened? - I broke ties with Madhu forever. Why? - He doesn't take life seriously. I cannot tolerate that. I don't need anyone. I'm fine by myself. But I am not so alone. You are with me, aren't you? Hello. Is Mr.Sinha home? He called me a while ago. Perhaps you didn't recognise me. The last time I came, you were playing the piano. Then you'd brought tea. WhV don't you speak? Will your prestige suffer if you talk to me? You have only learnt to play the piano, not any manners. Tell Mr.Sinha he can come and meet me in my office. Pardon me, I cannot speak, I am dumb' What is the matter, Shanker? I want to say something. Mr.Sinha, if you have no objection I would like to marry your daughter. Bali had taught him to speak when she was a child. He still speaks, but she has lost her voice. I know Yet you That is why I want to marry her. - That's okay, but You are still young. You must be wanting to do a lot in life. Bali could become a burden for you. Think again. - If anyone has to think, it is your daughter.

Put it off! What if there was a fire? Go out! The workers are being informed that this department will remain closed from 1st June, for:3O days. What does this mean? How do I know? I am just an ordinary director. Go and ask what it means from your new managing director. New managing director, new notice. 200 workers will be rendered jobless. He's just arrived and we have become jobless. We will give a befitting reply. We'll strike work from today itself. No, it's not right to be hasty. If we have to strike work we'll give it due thought first. You can have your union meetings outside. But over here, you'll have to work for eight hours Go on, get to work. "So many desires awakened" Why are you still here? To tell you that they are workers, not your slaves. Through? I said what I had to. Listen! What is your name? Tarun. Oh, so you are the secretary of the workers union. That is what the union thinks. You may leave. The number necessary to become director? I didn't abuse you; I called my scooter a devil. It broke down, and nowl am late. Then throw it away. - If I had so much strength, I'd throw you. What happened to your machine? My machine is fine. It's my scootefis machine that broke down. Then go call some mechanic. So that you can steal it and disappear? Whose cycle have you stolen? Come on! I was just joking. Wait! Yes? - Please send some mechanic. - Go yourself. You even speak English! Say it again. What a melodious voicellf anyone heard it with closed eyes it feels like a fair lady's heart has shattered. Please help me, or my heart will break. Please! Enough, don't say please again. Or I'll become your slave forever. Your scooter is very nice. No, it's not. It ditched me. It must have thought someone else is riding it. There's enough petrol in it.

I'll always remember you. Even I will always remember you. - Not sohard. Pick this. Clean this table. Roma, you? I've come to meet your wife. In this get up'? So that brother doesn't come to know I've come here. Bye. Bye!Listen, go from here. No, I'll go from the main door. Go from wherever you wish. Dry fruit seller! Hey! Where are you barging in? Get out! Don't be angry. I am new here. Whoever you are, just leave! You called me? Have patience. What a lovely baby. What are you saying? He's a beautiful boy. She's a girl. So what? All babies are cute. I don't want money. Eat it for free. "So many desires awakened" Grow up to be beautiful and make your mother proud. She picked a walnut! She's a brave baby. She seems to be from my family. Your family? - Yes, my baby. She looks like Rehman. Who Rehman? Me. You rascal! I'll throw chillies in your eyes! What is the matter? Throw him out! He is saying my baby looks like him. I am speaking the truth. See and do justice. This is nature's doing. He's right. Good! She is my baby, and she looks like him??? What did you say! Don't shout! Why is the truth annoying you? Hey, come here. Who does the baby look like? Like me. Then both of you get out of here! Come, darling! Leave me! Brother, after you. No, after you. Remove your hat. No! Sister-in-law, I am Roma. This is your mischief! 'Who won't die over such innocence' 'She fights, but doesn't even carry a sword' I have a broom though! You know who has put up this notice. Our new managing director Mr.Gupta. Who was like us, born in a poor family. But who has changed now. I don't know how much. - Then go wear bangles and sit at home. Who will pay for the bangles? Me. Then you only wear the bangles. I think we should send someone to Shanker Gupta. To beg at his feet? No, to know his strategy. No. - We'll go on strike. We must strike work. Or he'll think that this earth, the wind, the moonlight everything is for him alone. Not for us, whose blood runs his machines. Poison kills poison. Ainched pennies and saved a million For you people. How much money do you need to stick to a strike? RsJOOOO? Here's a cheque. The society, the atmosphere, has become corrupted. Clean the system forever. So that we can breathe easy. Father. You are all aware that this cheque is worthless. My father has no account in any bank. But what he said is also right. Your father turned insane fighting for justice. In this very mill where he worked as manager. I know, Madhukaka. This mill is jinxed. D your father mad, and maimed my hL yes So who will go to meet Shanker Gupta. Janaki, you? Why doesn't he go? He is our leader. I don't have the same passion as you. Forget the passion, but won't anyone do anything for the man who turned mad in this very mill, for all of us, for you? Hello. Hello. I am Tarun. You must be. I have met you before. Me? Impossible. I have just come from Shimla. Nowl remember! I have met a boy who looks just like you. Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? Is there no difference between a boy and girl? Yes, but You cannot see the difference. Listen, I have come to meet Mr.Gupta, not you. Oh, then say that. Come in. Have a seat, I'll send brother. Thank you. Hello, sir. Hello. How is your father? I have come on behalf of the union. - Why here? You should have met me in office. And waste the time for which you pay us wages? Rs.8 for 8 hours. You are closing one department of the mill. - Yes. What about the workers? Who owns the mill, you people or me? The country. - I ask, who does it belong to lawfully? Law gives us some rights too. You want to say anything more? I still haven't got a reply to my question. What if you don't get one? I got it. Mr.Gupta, just remember, if even one worker is dismissed our union will not remain silent. You've come to threaten me? No, to understand you. You are a good leader. Bye! Uncle, this boy is very intelligent. Then why the fight? Not fight, argument. I was trying to understand him. Hey! Don't beat me! Your hand is so soft. I hear a girl's voice in your voice. Girl?A woman? Why are you staring at me? I see her face in your face. Who is she? There is one girl, who looks just like you. How many times have you met her? - Just once. Today. Today! That's great! True love! Love at first sight! You know where she lives? I do, but I can't go there. Why? She's a mill owner's sister and I am a poor mill worker. She's the sky, I'm the earth, she's the moon, I'm dust. Shame on you! Man has reached the moon. And the moon on earth has made you helpless. You have brought disgrace to lovers! I won't talk to you. You are not a lover, you are a coward.

What? Did you marry for the second time? I'll kill myself but before that I'll kill you. Why are you shouting at me? I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about my brother. Really? - Yes. I was so scared. Who's the bride? Mr.Sinha's daughter. She's a very nice girl. But she's not like you, she's so timid. She's so silent. Everything will change after marriage. No it won't she's dumb. Even I was like that before I got married to you. But she's really dumb I swear. Then why is he getting married to a dumb girl? Shall I tell you the truth? -Yes. - I'll tell you. He has learnt from my experience. What did you say? You just don't understand. Actually he has a soft corner for that girl. You are so shameless. He must be having an eye on her father's mill. Sheela, mind your language. It's true that I'm not in good terms with my brother. But he is just great. He's a true gentleman. He may be in love with a dumb girl we may not understand his feelings. I want something like do you get it? There should be some fights and quarrels at home. All because of you. What did you say? Okay I'm responsible. Get lost. You lose your temper quite often these days. Why didn't he invite you? He didn't invite anyone for his marriage. Mr.Sinha is not well. So they are having a registered marriage. Registered marriage? Oh something like those registered letters which the postman brings? Oh great! You are so smart. Absolutely right. Hell with such marriages! I won't get my daughter married in a post office. As if that child is just a letter. Today they call it registered," tomorrow they may call it telegram. Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? What? What did you say? Don't act funny. Now what was that siren for? There's a bad news. I just came here to say that Mr.Sinha is no more. The mill will remain closed today. We all have to die some or the other day. Life and death the circle goes on. It's easy to poke fun at others but don't forget that very soon there'll be lots of problems in the mill. No one can avert that. One machine will be a substitute for two workers. Consequentlymhalf the laborers will have to be chucked out. And do you think they won't react to it? And what if we don't remove any of them. This is a Mill not a charity home. So that they get money for nothing. What if we get more machines sufficient enough for all the workers. Will you get the machines from the air? No the consignment will come by the ship within Two weeks. Yes two weeks. Read the report so that you understand the matters. even their salaries are increased. So that we incur a huge loss again. The workers will work even more when all their needs are fulfilled. It's just a dream. Things won't change that easily. Not just that, the Managing Director's ingenious idea is against the ideology of capitalism. I don't believe in any of these ideologies. I just think about the workers. What's this? - For him the workers are more important. What's the matter? Sir, the new machines The new machines were installed two months ago. Did anyone get a notice? Was anyone removed? Can't you just work? Go and do your work. He's just great. He has not changed at all. Every time he meets me, he slaps me. Good that I was weak in maths I never got the right number of slaps. By the time I could get the right total I used to forget the number of slaps. Just look how swollen my cheeks are. Why aren't you laughing? Brother, I was just telling them about you. I had come here to meet sister in law. We were having great fun. Just you alone. No, not me alone. Look she's still laughing. On your foolishness. Brother. You are still not capable enough to make someone happy. You are right, brother. Yes brother I'm just a lowly man. And sol - Let's go, Sheela. We are lowly people. Greetings Sister in law. Everyone thinks that I'm a selfish man. Even my own brother feels that way. Useless fellow! Do you think that it's my mistake? Then why don't the others think like you? Why do they think that I do everything for money? Why do they feel that a rich man is always cruel? What should I do? Renounce everything and become a recluse? Let it be. I'll have tea at Madhu's place. He must be annoyed with me. Good that you came. Why? What do you want? The union needs your help. Money perhaps we'll have to go on a strike. Against Shankar Brother. No, against the cruel employers. What do I have with me? Tasty saviors nothing else. Your song your performance just for a single show. Oh no I can't do that. That means you just love your brother. The rest means nothing to you. Okay we won't have his tea hereafter. Hey what's going on? Tell him. The twelfth, Janta Theaters at nine at night. Don't go your wife will throw you out. Did you hear that? I'm feeding it milk. Let me see if it makes any difference. Uncle, why do you always Are you angry? I was just joking to lighten your mood. What brings you here? - You think that I've changed a lot. The workers feel that I'm unjust to them. The board of directors think that I'm mad. Do you think a rich man can get away without scorns? Shankar, come here, just listen. What are you doing? Ramu brother! Someone, please help me. Ramu brother! Ghost! Oh lord! Why is he dancing like this? Where are you going? To bring someone. Please don't touch me. Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? Look at him. Maharajm. oh, I'll fall down. Hail Lord shiva. Why is he behaving like this? - I have no idea. I'll tell you, Sire. He's a talented dancer, while she's against it. She forced him to leave dancing. It's a sin! A grave Sin! Child, it's God's gift to him. Dance is worship for him. Let him dance. Or else, there would be a catastrophe! He'll become mad. I don't care. I won't let him dance with anyone else. Then why did you call me here and waste my time? Please don't go. She's out of her mind. What do you want? I have no desires, my child! I have no desire for riches. I understand. RsJOO? Get it soon. Hail Lord Shiva! Foolish lady, will you let him dance now? Will you let him go? Certainly not alone. Who asked you to let him go alone? If you are with him, then no other woman will try to woo him. Take his blessings Give me your blessings. God bless you, child. What are you doing? "I'm going far away from life" "leaving my first wife behind" "my dear friends." "My first wife made my life a hell" "and I can't find a second wife" "my dear friends." "Whose Son in law I couldn't become" "O fathers-in-law, please listen to me" "I was not fortunate enough to marry you" "O wives, I bid you adieu" "Farewell farewell!"

"You can choose anyone amongst us" "O my love" "Beautiful lovely" "All of you are so beautiful" "I'm in love with all of you" "I will marry each one of you" "O lovely maidens" "You are my love you are my beloved" "You are my darling you are my sweetheart" "O.. my dearest wives" Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? "if you could accompany us to the fairy land" "we would be so happy" "Let go of my hand what will the people say" "Let go of my hand what will the people say" "You have betrayed me O fairy" Oh yes nowl understand your plan. So that the workers get a new shelter and we are rendered homeless. My dear Managing Director may I ask you something? How will the Mill benefit by this? The workers will come for work no matter what the climatic conditions are. If they stay in such houses they'll work even more diligently. Gentleman, it's an appeal. Please don't refuse. My lovely dear my cutie pie Hey, don't teach her your language. Well my daughter will be like me not you. Brother Come in, sister in law. Give it. What's it? - Tarun's mother's hand got caught in the machine. Come let's hurry. Sister in law Excellent the tea is just great! But we'll enjoy it even more in those new houses. Where some will go and some won't. Yes, that's Mr.Gupta's plan? New houses, differences amongst the workers and a weak Union! With your permission. Cheat, swindler attire that of a patriot deeds, that of a traitor! So, what have you thought about shifting to your new houses? None of us will go there. So, finally Desai has influenced you. Don't listen to them, Tarun. They've taken the Mill for grantedsince the day I met with this accident. Nothing else. Just keep quiet. Isn't it because I'm handicapped that you don't respect me now? Isn't it because nowl survive on your mercy? Then leave me. Bring someone else. Who's stopping you? But you should leave me for that. Did you see that? What a great plot Gupta has hatched! We are having fights already. That's why I always say, never take hasty decisions. I think we should think about it. That we'll do later have tea before that. Or it will be cold. Oh no Janki Aunty, it's piping hot. Just like your temper! Tarun, your mother's hand got caught in the machine. Mother, what happened to your hand? Shall I tell you who she is? She's Madhu's Sister she's a very nice person. She made tea for us. She even took care of your mother and then she prepared lunch for us. You Okay..I'll leave now. Will you go alone? I'll go on my own. Tarun, go with her. Let's go. She's such a nice girl. One in a million. Right? Yes. Won't it be nice if she becomes a member of our family? What are you saying? Money is nothing. I'm ready to spend fifty thousand. It's such a beautiful place. Yes. Bye. Won't you come in? No, it's almost midnight. Are you afraid of the dark? I was under the assumption that you are just afraid of girls. Girls like me. Let me listen to it. The music is so soothing. So what? Sister-in-law. Everything has a time, Roma. Brother.. - Won't you let me have my breakfast? I'm sorry. Bali, did you notice that Roma has changed a lot? Shall I ask you something? Do you think that Roma will be happy with Tarun? Do you know Tarun? Then how could you say that? Flowers. Buds. Blooming buds. Butterflies. What do you want to say? I don't understand music. Two birds. You intend to say that Roma and Tarun are in love. Don't worry, Bani. But I'll have to think about it. But trust me I won't make Roma sad. Sister-in-law! Manager, I think Come in. Did you call me, sir? What do you think about a promotion? Me? - That's because you are very hardworking and honest. Thanks a lot. Mr. Puri, issue the orders that Tarun will be the Weaving Master from the first of the next month Weaving Master? Any problems? No, but before that I should be the assistant weaving master? I know that. - Then why this special preference for me. This is just an acknowledgement for your dedication. Is it because I'm the labour union secretary? What do you mean? - I need a promotion not bribe. I've never offered bribe to anyone in my life. And I've never accepted bribes. No matter what you call it. May I leave? Sure. Foolish man. No, he's not foolish. It is because of Desai's instigation. You are happy because your brother wanted to promote me? Really? - Yes, so that the people won't say that a mill owner's sister is in love with a worker. Why did you recommend me? What? Didn't you? - No. That means our friendship did the recommendation for me. Tarun! - Do you want me to stoop so low? My brother is not such a person who would bribe people. You don't know how wealth changes people. Opposites can't meet, Roma. I should have thought about this before. I won't meet you again. He's mad. He's mad. Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? I want to find a nice boy for Roma. What's the matter? She often meets Tarun. So what's the problem? Get them married. Roma will never marry Tarun. You'd said he's nice boy. But he will never prosper. He's very head strong. Aren't you? I came to you for advise. Look Forgive me. Had it not been for your friends I'd never forgive you. But now you've forgiven me? Yes. Ms Roma, hurry up. Will you always be with me? If you promise to behave maturely. - I will. Greetings! I am Biharilal, the boy's father. - Who? Had he not been my son I'd still say that he's a nice boy. He never hurts anyone and the workers dote on him. You know him? Yes, very well. And your Roma is an angel. She cooked for us when Tarun's mother hurt her hand. She even made tea for me. They are made for each other. That's why they are always together. Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? I too have some urgent work. Tell me should I fix the marriage date or you will do it? What marriage? You think I've gone mad? I am but a bit. And every rich man is. I have a small bank balance of Rs ten lakhs. Your sister will be very happy. She is an angel. Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? So you know everything? Ygu? Send Roma. She is on stage. I'll be very happy if you also come in. I don't care for others happiness. Send Roma. She can't come. Insolent! Well done, Roma! I must leave now. Brother mustn't know, uncle. He's outside. What will happen now? Don't get scared, come. Doctor, what is the matter? Don't worry. I've prescribed two types of vitamins. One for Mrs Bali," And the other? I don't know if it will be a boy or girl. How come you are back early? Simply. Silent? Where is mother? She's gone with father for a dressing. Did you get a scolding last night? I was scared you may not be punished for my sake. We have committed no sin. Shall I make tea? I've to leave now. I came thinking I might meet you. Good I met you. Who told Mr Gupta that you'd gone for dancing? Your father. My father? But why? Why did he go your brother? You say. - You are smiling, how would I know? Then ask your father. You tell me. There are certain things a girl can't say. He went to fix your marriage. My marriage? But why to Mr Gupta? Father shouldn't have met your brother. I'm sure he must have ridiculed my father. But father is not at fault. He is mad. Can't a mad man dream about his son's happiness? Roma, how long more do I have to suffer? I'm swinging between hope and despair. Where were you? Why, what happened? A machine burnt. Oh! What if Mr Gupta comes to know that you went without permission? Girdhari will get a chance to plot against you. The workers will get agitated and he is their leader. What are you implying? Can't you forgive him? I can't keep workers who don't love their work. This notice must be reach him by tomorrow. NO No No.. This is injustice. Tarun is our union leader and we can't bear this. Yes. We must give a fitting reply. But I was really,.. That is not the issue. He's using this as an excuse to get even with you. This injustice is against union. He'll have to take it back. Yes, or else," Strike! Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? Even the clerks may strike to support us. Really? Then you will surely win. Ours. Do come tomorrow. Perhaps I may give you a good news. Mr Managing Director, isn't it true,.. That Tarun was given the notice as he loves your sister? No. - Isn't it true that they love each other? May be. Answer me yes or no. I don't want to answer. Don't they love each other? And you hate it? Yes. Why? - Because I don't like that boy. So Tarun was given the notice because he doesn't like him. Isn't it true that you love Mr Gupta's sister? How is that concerned with the strike? Isn't it true that you tell her about the union? Janki aunt, she is with us not against us. She is with you. What do you mean? And how many know that the clerks will also go on strike? Only we five. No, even she knows our enemy's sister, isn't it? Where are you going? To find the betrayer. Give tea to the children. Free tea for the strikers. If the strike continues, you'll get free biscuits also. Khan, tell my wife that I'll be late. Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? I can see through your ploy. Ploy? - I didn't know you were twin faced. One of an beautiful angel in whose eyes I see my dreams. And the other of a spy who spies for her brother. No, Tarun. What is the matter, Tarun? Ask her, who made friends as Rehman and sympathized as Roma. But her true work was enmity. Damn such friendship and sympathy! I had to go through nonsense to agree to the union's demands. I'd not have cowed down. But my own sister is against me. I wonder what more I'll have to undergo for her sake. Where were you? To the hamlet. Why? To meet Tarun. This is the limit! You stay out of it. When did you go? Why don't you understand? I tried but I can't believe it. Roma, and what our relationship? I want to know what about our relationship? Don't you know? But what about you? You are educated and intelligent. You know your happiness means more to me than my happiness. I've never come in your way nor will I do so. But what you mistake for love is actually a farce. But I'll marry only Tarun. Is this your final decision? I mean nothing to you? Nothing There are many brothers who don't have sisters. But they don't die! Brother! Get out of here! There's no place in my house for those who squander their life. What is this you are doing? Go and look up Roma. Why, what's happened to her? She neither eats nor drinks anything. That Tarun is gone mad. You go to Roma while I'll go to Tarun. I'll try to see him see sense. Who's that? Coming. What brings you here? I've come to ask you if mad men have horns? What do you mean? No, isn't it? He's known by his deeds, isn't it? Roma is depressed there and you are sad here. Tell me so who's mad? Tell me. Don't talk to me about this. Great! She left her house for you. My wife is consoling her for your sake. And you behave as if you are a great leader! Love come after union. Love comes before all else. Without love even the union can't function. Come and apologize to her. No. I won't go until I find the traitor. You think she's the traitor? Who else? You believe only what you see. All are welcome to my house but not you. What happened? He is a fool. Talk softly, Roma is inside. He's a fool. Go and make her see sense. You do it. My husband had gone to meet Tarun. Fights precede love. The more the fights the stronger is the love. So much love Greetings, aunt!!! Roma, look Philomena aunty's come. How's sister in law? She's better with god's grace. What happened? She had a fall. She's still in bed. Why do you cause her tension? I'll go but what about brother? What are you saying? He is after all your brother. Aunty, tell sister in law, I'll bring Roma. Don't get scared. Your brother goes to the mill. Yes, Manager? There is a bad news. What? The directors have decided to sell off their shares. Reason? - They fear they will incur losses. Due to you. Due to me? This is Mr Desia's opinion. Other directors are also supporting his view. Now? I'll buy all the shares. You will buy it? Yes. But where are those shares? They were with you. You are angry with me? There is more to life than emotions. One has to think what's good but Roma doesn't understand this. And she doesn't even want me to explain this to her. Besides Roma is like a daughter to me. I'm not a toy whom you can discard when you feel angry. Insolent! Get out and don't you dare come here again. Sister, how's sister in law? This is very tragic. The child died No! And she can never conceive again. I am responsible for all this. Roma, don't blame yourself for it. This is so tragic. Yes. This is double faced. What did you say? I know all this sympathy is just a farce. I know a mother's feelings. Poor sister in law! Then share her grief. If only I could. You can if you want to. How can I share her grief? Forget it. Tell me. Take Neelu to sister in law. I'll do that. - Then tell her that this child is now hers. What did you say? I can't do this. Neelu is my child and I won't give my child to anybody. What did you say? You? Sheela, is Neelu only your child not mine? Am I not her father? If you think I'm wrong then take this stick and hit me. I will not protest. Take it! Who is she? Manu's daughter? What does that mean? Keep her back. I won't let you be her maid. Not even her mother. Bani, I won't come inside. I feel angry on you and the child also. And also on myself and my destiny. What is this? - An accident occurred in the mill. How did this accident happen? Tarun is injured? Ask the mill doctor to go with him. Not the general ward. Book a special room for him. Don't bother about the expenses. Our mill owner Mr Gupta's sister. She's come to look after a worker's health. You can't meet him. The doctor's forbidden. For just a moment. Why? Get out! - Madam, I'll take this to him if you so wish. What? Notice? What notice? The union has given a notice. You'll want:10% more increment. Within a week? Listen, who has signed the notice? Tarun has signed it. Mr Puri, this notice is illegal. What do they think of themselves? Shut the mill. What?! Yes, lockout! Yes, lockout! That was some notice. Had we not sent that notice we'd have fought amongst ourselves. Tarun and I would've been on one side and Janki and her accomplices on the other side. What we had decided comes into effect with this notice. Shankar Gupta," Be damned! Janki, think it over. Do you know the outcome," if you go back now? - The strikers will have to quit. Is it agreeable to you? No. Shankar Gupta be damned! It's enough if this slogan is voiced all over the city. Shankar Gupta be damned! We'd rather die of starvation. The workers want to pressurize me into acceptance. I've shut the mill. I am elder. They are younger. So? I must accept their demands. I too want the same," and so I've bought all the shares But they want someone like Desai. They don't trust me. This is my mill and all the shares will be mine. It is my baby. The mills plan! Distributing sweets for Diwali with Desai and the directors. The workers never complained. But times have changed now. Don't you also have faith in me? Hat is your rePW? Your eyes say it all but I know what I've done is right. Whatever you think doesn't effect me. Shankar Gupta be damned! I'm not hurt but you call the police immediately. The mill must come to no harm. Hurry up, it is my responsibility. Bani, that day I'm grieved and am leaving this house for good. Forgive me, if you can. Where did Bani go? I don't know. Sir, I too want to leave. To my native place. Bani madam has settled my account. Why are you going? How can I not go? I came when madam got married. Since then I'm with her. Today I'm not with her in her crisis. You hold me responsible for it? You are the master and I the servant. What can I tell you? Bani was a child to me. So I'll definitely tell you something before I leave. Had she had her voice then she'd had the world at her feet. What is the matter? Bani has left. - She musfve gone to meet someone. No, she's left me. Did you both have a fight? Yes. But that doesn't mean she leaves the house and goes. Even animals don't want to leave their house until they are pushed too far. You must've thought she's dumb she has no feelings also. Did I say something harsh? Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? You always do that. I was ambitious for you. But you thought you were god. Brother, are you angry with me? I came to tell you that sister in law is in my house. I knew it. - Sister in law didn't want you to know. But I couldn't hold myself. Come and take her. Did you say all that you wanted to? Brother, I've said all I wanted to. But what I don't understand is if you are angry with yourself, fine why are you angry with the world? Madhu, you go. - Sister in law came to my house I felt as if my mother has come. You will only have trouble if you won't come for her. I am going. Lam going, uncle. Don't ruffle angry feathers. What can anyone do if someone is bent on hurting themselves? Have you also come to give sermons? No. Then why have you come to me? Uncle has told several times that we have an elder brother who sold rats as a child and pulled carts. Seeing his father drunk, he didn't hate him but poverty. Where is my brother? Who has sent you, Tarun? Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? Tarun thinks I'm a traitor and your spy. He hates me because I am your sister. How would he know that my brother who brought me up as a daughter who pampered me is not you but someone else. Don't get angry. Just tell me where is my brother who loved my sister in law who even loved his workers who cried on seeing tears in my eyes. Where is he? Tell me where do I have to sign? Please sit. I'll tell you. - When does the registrar's office close? See, if my papers are ready. Are Mr Gupta's papers ready? Send it immediately. All this violence will yield no result. Yesterday we stoned the car, now we'll break the mill gate. Then we'll break the machines. Certainly. Who is the loser? The bosses. Isn't it our loss also? Our fight is not against the mill or mill owners. But with the system that wants to snatch away our rights. Stop sermonizing. Tell me who'll pay your medical bills? Ml' Gupta! You were resting in the hospital and have come now with a bandage! What does this mean? A compromise with Mr Gupta, the mill owner. He's sold himself. You're siding with the enemy. Down with you! Did you climb four flights of stairs to say that? Madam! Sir is not at home. Who are you and why are you silent? Is Shankar at home? If you are loyal to him, don't let him come to the mill. But what can you do? I'll try to stop them. Can you imagine what will happen if they break the gates? Look! Did you see that? What is all this? So the boss has sent you to save the mill? Where is he hiding? In the locker! This mill is mine, his what do you mean? What? This mill is our mother? No, it is a devil. Yes! What did we get? Not food but poison. Why should we see from your viewpoint? Madhav? - He came to set the mill ablaze. Who is he? He's not one among us. Who are you? Tell me. Desai sent me. Speak up. Rogue! You wanted to set the mill ablaze. Rogue! You wanted to set the mill ablaze. Glories to Shankar Gupta! What is the mattter? They came to burn. They first broke open the lock and then set fire. I think it would be better. When your dear ones turn against you then strangers will be foes. Mr Puri, let's go. Brother! Impudent! You want to hit me? All along you've hit me. You think we all have turned against you. But it is you who are a stranger to us. You are so arrogant. You want everyone to obey you. But god, who's greater than you, can't make us like you. Who are you to do it? If you utter a word more Down with Shankar Gupta! Shut up! Brother! Who threw this stone? Come forward if you dare. You forgot that one day I too was a worker like you. I too can reply you in the same coin. This will happen until you think the mill as your enemy. No decisions will be made. Talk about the present. Since you became the owner What have I done? I put new machines but did I throw anyone of you? You couldn't. I didn't want to. Didn't I try to make new houses for you all? From my profits. To break our unity. If that was so, I'd not fight my directors for your increment. But did we get an increment? How could you? As soon as you sent a notice for lock out they started selling shares to oust me. But I didn't accept defeat and bought all those shares. For a lock out. - You are responsible for that not l. Whenever I've seen smoke from the chimney of this mill I remembered all the unfulfilled dreams. Which even your parents couldn't fulfill. I realized until we all don't own these mills these fights will never end. If you think this is my defeat it is not your victory either. I can bear anything but not the enemies of this mill even if the are my own family. Today I'll speak to you the way I spoke to you earlier when you'd see this mills's chimney longingly just as we see it now. You think we are the mill's enemies? Had it been so, you'd not have been the owner. By now it would have been reduced to ashes. Desai's henchmen had come to set it ablaze. But we poor people saved it. Tarun saved it and injured himself in the bargain. Uncle Madhav, it is useless talking to him. He thinks we hate him. Then what else I agree that you thought about our well-being you tried to get rich at our cost. But have you thought of yourself as an individual? Can you run the mill alone or bring a revolution? No? No, I can't. Nobody can change it. Not even you. But still a loner has every right to choose a new path. I had a dream, not about the present," I was dreaming for the future. You are right in your way and they in their way. We have to see where time leads us to. These are those papers which Mr Gupta signed before coming here. In the presence of witness. These documents decree that hereafter everyone of you owns the mill equally. Mr Gupta has made this a co-operative society. Now it is your responsibility to run it. Until the workers and owners," don't become one nobody among us can reach our goals. Where is Shankar? Who says that dreams are never fulfilled? Brother, we've come to you with a request. Don't act tough. We all are very happy. Tarun and Badri have started the mill. Brother! You are simply great! You gave everything you had. You are a nice man. Money means nothing. What is this you are doing? You are mounting a lamp? It will enlighten the entire universe.
