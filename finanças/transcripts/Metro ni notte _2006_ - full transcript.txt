I want to learn physics at Kyoto University Well, that sounds good But my father wants me to attend the Tokyo Imperial University He says if I go to a regional school he won't pay for it He says, "who do you think feeds you anyway"... That sounds like what your father would say So, I got angry and told him that a parent has the responsibility to support his children I said "If you're going to be like that, you shouldn't have had me" "it was your decision to have me I never asked to be born!" That may have been a little overboard Yes, you're right... it was childish of me To be honest I also want to go to Kyoto to get away from my father Well, you shouldn't lose your temper Yes... I understand I'd better go Aren't you going to come in? It's late, I'll come by on another day Don't tell your father Things could get a little troublesome Yes sir Promise me Don't leave the house tonight Why? Just do as I say Yes sir What? Hey... Who is it? Master Shoichi? Please take care of him Huh? No matter what happens tonight don't let him out of the house Huh? Don't go out Yes sir Well Who was that? My uncle And, so when you went back down the stairs at Shin Nakano you were back in the corridor at Nagatacho station? What is that, a time slip? So, did you talk to your mom about it? It would be harder to ask her to believe, so... Guess so... They used to have such wonderful designs Okay, okay Anyway, don't talk about this to anyone else Michiko and I will believe you but if the younger guys get wind of this they won't be able to stop laughing Sure, I believe He's one of our employees What's that supposed to mean? Well, it's kind of like this whole company is from a past time You do have a point... Okamura Clothing Company Yes, this is Karube, Thank you for calling Next spring's bras? Let me look at the designs while I explain them to you Hold please Yesterday was the anniversary of my brother's death... OK, calm down, calm down Your brother died in an accident after eleven o'clock And you took him home before nine o'clock to avoid the accident Right? So, has the present changed? Is your brother alive? No, I talked my mom last night... And my brother had another fight with my dad... and ran out of the house See, there, right Nothing changes after all Therefore, you're here the same as usual Your mom is at the apartment praying as usual Your wife is at the supermarket working a cash register and your little brother is probably sleeping in the back of his Mercedes Hasebe I understand your feelings toward your brother but it's a good thing that nothing has changed If your story turns out to be true and you changed the past there'd be a ripple somewhere You never know how it could have affected you as well Crime and Punishment You commit a crime you get punished I've finally reached the climax Oh, by the way, how's your father Hey We're back Good work Hi Our company's crime and punishment Huh? Welcome back I sympathize with the way you feel But, legal separation from your family doesn't change the fact that you are Sakichi Konuma's son Go and visit him Yes sir Sakichi Konuma Hospitalized I didn't know your father was Sakichi Konuma... Always rice omelets Hm? The only rice omelets that I ate were my mother's We couldn't afford to eat out I was allowed to put as much ketchup on it as I liked at home Shinji? Hm? What is your father like? Just like everyone says Money, money, money, and the world revolves around him He never thinks about anybody else Even his family? Yeah, he treats his family the worst That's why I left and separated from his family Just an upstart They call him a self made entrepreneur and at the same time he's indicted for tax evasion wrapped up in scandals He's a prime example of the "ends justify the means" I wonder what he's thinking about... in his hospital bed When the going gets rough he always checks into the hospital This time, he was in the middle of a congressional hearing about bribes that's the kind of man he is What are you going to do from now on? About? About your father Nothing's going to change Nothing needs to change You're legally separated Yeah Hasebe is my mother's maiden name Mine too, Karube is my mother's maiden name Since birth, though At design school, I read a book by Sakichi Konuma All lies After the war, in all the confusion he profited by pulling off some scams. That's all So you have read the book You must be... like your father Sakichi Konuma How You're both cold hearted I'm not that cold hearted I haven't abandoned my family I'm sorry I'm... jealous Not of your wife... of you Shinji, you're not forgotten, by anybody POST WW II Mister, your shoes Hey, what are you doing Hey, hey Okay, they're clean.
