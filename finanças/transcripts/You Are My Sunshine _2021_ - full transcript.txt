[birds chirping] [music score] [music stops] [radio plays in background] [door closes] We had the weight of the world on our shoulders back then didn't we? Could have been worse. Can you remember what it was like here 50 years ago? Be confined to a cell just for giving passing looks to one another in the street. Yeah, you're right. Just look at that tie! Oh here we go again! There we go. Ready for the day. - Are you sure you don't want me to come with you? - I'll be fine. Besides I think it's best to go it alone. She can be unpredictable at the best of times. As long as you're sure? I'm sure. Keep wrapped up. It's chilly out there! Happy now? Fine. Good. See you later my sweet. Wish me luck. [warm music] Ethel and our John, the genius! Hi Uncle Joe. It's good to see you, we've missed you. [children's games in the distance] Yes. Yes we have. Ethel, I've missed you too. I've took the liberty of ordering two pots of tea. I know you like a brew in here Ethel. Thank you. I think I should mention... we can't stay long. I've got some items to pick up and John has offered to drive me to collect them. I see. We don't have to rush off, Mum. We can have some time here first. It's not like this is a regular thing, you haven't seen each other in months. Yes, but you know how long I've been waiting for those items to be delivered. What are you getting? It's some materials for my knitting club. I decided to try some new colours and I've ordered from a company I'm not sure about but... Oh well, I'm sure they'll be fine. We finally finished that new hallway. You remember, the light green? I bet it looks lovely Uncle Joe. And how's Uncle Tom? Is he well? Oh he's fine, he's fine. He sends his love as always. He's always asking me how you're getting on at university. Well we both do wonder. You're the first proper brain box in the family. I wouldn't say brain box. Not with how cheap the drinks are there. Well, we're both very proud of you. Thanks Uncle Joe. Mum was just saying the other day... Maybe it's time we've paid a visit to you. Didn't you Mum? Well we don't need to jump that fence just yet. Well, you'd be welcome, always of course. Always! As I said... we'll see. I've got a lot on at the moment. Maybe you could pop by soon, just after you're busy. And I'm off you know, I'm on study leave, so I can always drive you Mum. Yes, and I could do some cakes and do some sandwiches and... I said no! [melancholic music] I mean... not yet. I'm just not ready. Mum, please... Sorry I didn't... No Uncle Joe, it's not your fault. Mum, you've got to stop with this. It's not the dark ages anymore! John, please let's go. I'll see you again soon. Maybe in a few months perhaps? Happy Birthday. [door opens] [door closes] [music stops] I'm sorry Uncle Joe. No it's okay... No, it's not. She's just being selfish and it annoys me. Don't speak about your mother like that our kid. She's just trying to understand it all still. It does annoy me though, it's been over 40 years. That's long enough for anyone to accept, the world's moved on and yet she can't seem to. Will you give her this letter from us both. From your Uncle Tom and me I mean. and one there for you too for your birthday in a few weeks. We didn't know what to get you so we just put some money in for you. I can't have money off you, you can't afford it. Ah, ah, ah. It'll be for your studies, well in your case, drinking studies. - Well I'm paying for the teas. - Oh no you're not. - Yeah just watch me. - It's my treat. Now go take your mother to get her things. Happy Birthday Uncle Joe. Tell Uncle Tom hello from me. Well... from us. I will. Now get off you young scallywag. Go and do your young things. I will talk to her though. I promise. Bye. Bye our John... and thanks. [children's screams in the distance] [door opens] [door closes] Happy Birthday to me. [melancholic music] [sighs] Good lad. Now take these brushes... Go ask old Mr Gibson if you can wash them through so we can reuse them tomorrow. Sure thing Pa. Oh hello Mr Joe, how's the new paint job looking? It's looking good Mr Gibson Sir. Pa wants to know if I can rinse off these brushes in here? Yeah, course. Park yourself over there and you can just get on with it. Okay thanks. [sound of brushes in the pot] [romantic music] Good morning. Ah! And you're the final one young Tommy lad! What's this I hear about you just throwing your stock at my customers. You're supposed to hand them over personally. Honestly what am I going to do with you? [romantic music] They're handmade leather belts, not sodden rags! Our customers want quality items delivered! Look, I'm sorry Mr Gibson, but time seems always to be against me! So I have to. So will the back of my hand in a minute! Anyway, I want it all to stop. I don't pay you to sprint around on that bike aiming at targets! [Mr. Gibson's muffled voice] Here! Here's your next batch to take with you and no more fun games or I'll hang you out to dry by your ears! Sure thing Mr Gibson! [sighs] Bloody royal pain in my side is that one! Sorry Mr Gibson. Young Tom there. Oh I suppose I shouldn't grumble. At least he turns up for work. Seems like a nice person. Yeah, I suppose. Anyway did you get your brushes done? Uh yes, thank you. I'll get them back to my Pa. Alright, let me know if you need anything else. I'll be here. Will do Sir. Thank you. [sighs] I think you missed a spot. So, hi? Hi, I'm Joe. Nice to meet you Joe. Wanna give me a hand a sec with these belts? Um, sure. Well, I can't say I've seen you around here before. Just moved up from down south. Bit bad down there for Pa's business so... he moved us here. Makes sense. You miss it? Didn't really do much. You not go out with mates? Didn't have any. You didn't have any mates? How you make sure that happened? I like reading a lot. It has a natural ability to repel those of the same age I find. Maybe I like reading too. Really? So what do you like doing? Well I like drawing... painting. Not the type you're doing mind. But you know, sketching stuff. Wow, well what kind of stuff have you drawn? Well maybe that's something you'll have to find out. What do you mean? Right! There, all done! Not so bad was it? I... I didn't complain. I'm playing you up! You're too easy to wind up you know. So I'll take it you don't know a lot of people around here then? Not really. Keep myself to myself. Help my Pa whenever I can. You uh... you want to see something cool? What? Meet me. Later at five down by the canal, just past the embankment yeah. You got a bike? You want me to meet you?! You could be anyone, some nutter who wants to chop me up! Well you'll never know unless you take a chance right? Joe! You done yet lad? Pack it up! Doing them now Pa. I'll meet you later then Joe. Remember the bike. Oh and I'm Tom by the way, since you didn't ask. [romantic music] [mocking expression] [subdued laughter] Hi Tom. Joe! You'll stop your daydreaming and pack this stuff up if you know what's good for you! Sorry Pa. [mobile phone rings] [music stops] Excuse me? Excuse me Mr.? I'm sorry, I was decades away. Sorry your phone's been beeping. [laughs] Thanks... I'd never have even heard it either. Oh... ah... eeny meeny miny mo. [romantic music] Oh! oh... oh dear. I thought you were a one off! Are you okay? Fine thanks. Just too much cold for these old bones to handle. You should get an mot. Yes I will. You sure you don't want me to hang around? In case you need an ambulance or anything? I'll be fine. I promise. And thank you for being so sweet. Well. [bike clicking] Well you brought the bike. Yeah of course I did. Well you must trust me then? Come on! [happy music] [Joe] Where is it you're taking me? [Tom] The old hill. [Joe] You're taking me to a hill? [Tom] It's not the hill that's the selling point. [Joe] Then what is? [Tom] You'll see! Be careful there! Why? Life is for living and this is most certainly that! When fresh air is running through your lungs on a beautiful day! I know but be careful! Oh come on! I'm fine! What could possibly go wrong? [tyres skid and Tom screams] Shit! Oh shit! Are you okay? Yeah I'm alright. Is anything broken? Can you stand up? Um... I think I've just added to the many other battle wounds received over the years. Let me look. It's alright. I've let me look. It's fine. Please. Sorry. You'll live. I hope so. Still got to get up that hill! What? I promised and I always keep them when I've made them. Wow. It... it's beautiful. I never knew the town could look so nice. I told you it was worth it. How... how is it then? Oh it's alright, don't worry. Thanks. Why do you come up here? Well, sometimes I come up here and sketch. But mostly I think I just like the quiet. I thought that would be a bad thing? Not really. You like being on your own? I guess so. Not always, mind. But sitting here you see it all... and everything, suddenly somehow finds its place, it's meaning. And you don't have to worry about your worries too here. You can temporarily evict them. How'd you do that? By using your imagination. See, what you do... is you imagine you can scoop all your worries out your head. Like so. And you put them in your hands, and then when you're ready, you just throw them away. See? Hey now you try. Uh... Go on. I... I feel silly. No, you look fine honest. Come on. [Jo exhales] How do you feel? I'm not sure. Oh well. Just keep trying. It works. Honest. You have to keep trying, either that, or we'll look like idiots together! [laughs] No, thank you. [romantic music] [small laugh] I'm sorry. I knew things wouldn't go swimmingly. I thought, just this once maybe. I'll make you another tea. She didn't even mention your name. It's okay. It's not okay Tom! She's my sister... and she couldn't even be bothered to... I'm sorry, I shouldn't shout at you. It's not your fault. You can shout at me as much as you like if it helps. It was part of the original job description with you. I just want you safe and happy. [melancholic music] [John clears his throat] [radio in background] You okay Mum? I come in peace. There better not be any sugars in this tea young man. Nice cup of tea. What were you looking at? What do you mean? But I saw you. I figured it must have been something that reminded you of Uncle Joe. It's a picture of the two of us when we were younger. With our father, your grandfather, Martin. Wow Mom! I didn't know you'd got this! It's nice to see you both when you were younger... in better times. John don't start! Today's already been enough of a strain on me as it is! You think it's not been one on Uncle Joe too? Mom, he looked heartbroken again. I don't expect you to understand. Why? Because I don't come from a time when being gay was something to fear... to be scared of? A stigma. For no reason at all I might add. John, I can't help the way I was brought up! The way your grandfather brought me up! Things were different back then. Now the world's more... rampant. Flexible. Back when we were kids, you... fitted in... conformed. [sighs] It wasn't a choice. Neither was the one Uncle Joe had to deal with! Mom... you're gonna have to start catching up with the world. Otherwise you're gonna get more and more left behind. So I don't have a choice? I didn't mean it like that. Look, you watch Graham Norton and Alan Carr on the box right? And I've seen you laugh at them. Mom, you know full well that they are both gay men on your telly. That's different son. Why? Because they're not your family? Not your responsibility? Mom, that one last link back to your past who's only ever wanted to have a relationship with you. He's no different to them. I just don't like to think about the intimacy thing. Then don't ask. Not sure Uncle Joe would want to part details with you on that aspect of his life. Mom, you've got to try and at least talk to him. Please. Before one day when it's too late to remedy all this. I don't ever want to see you living with that, Mom. John! Just leave me alone please! It's your loss. Every minute more you ignore him... is a minute less you'll have to spend with him. [door closes] [romantic music] Hey you! You okay Eth? Where you off to now? - I'm going out. - Out? Out with who? Tommy. You know. Aye I bloody do know him. You pair are as thick as thieves these days. Ere! Give me a hand with this lot before you go. It'll be ruined by this rain. - So, what gives then? - What you mean? Well we've been here for a few years now. You hardly ever went out at the best of times back down south. And now it's a rarity we see you! Well I guess I've finally come out of my shell. Aye with a bit help from that bleeding Tommy you're always on about! How about we meet him? I'm starting to think he's made up. Probably is knowing you with all your books and fantasy characters. No, he isn't. Good! We can have him round then. I don't know, he's pretty shy. Shy! Well he's brought you out your shadow make no mistake! And anyone who can do that is not shy if you're pardon my words. Still, I don't know Eth. Well, here's another idea. I'm off up the social with Mavis from work next weekend. How about you guys come along? Sure. I'll ask him. That should be fine. Right, I'm off. Ah, get off with ya! Hey you drag him kicking and screaming if you have to. You hear? [Tommy sings comically inside] [romantic music] I was told I had the voice of an angel when i was in church choir as a kid. Yeah, a drunken one. Fine! Come on up critic! But, you like. [Tom humming] [singing] I like you! Let's take this private concert inside then eh? [door closes] [music ends] [pencil sound] Mmm... Hang on! Just let me get this last part done. What are you drawing? Just something for my own little collection of work. Not me surely? Maybe I am. You need better looking models. Maybe I don't. [Joe exhales] [Joe takes a deep breath] Can I move now? Yeah. Can I see? Some artists don't like to show and tell. Oh come on please? - Please. - No. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please! Please. Please? Please? You never told me you were so good at this. It's just a sketch. I can't really afford a camera or I'd take a picture of you instead. Just so I have an image of you here... just for me. Thank you. No... thank you. You've changed my life, Joe. For the better I hope. For sure. And here's hoping the rest of the world follows along too. Where did you get this? A bunch of guys at Gibson's workshop had it. Passing it around. Making the usual cheap gaps. You know. [sighs] Oh um, Ethel wants us to go to the social on Saturday. What for? Well I think she's intrigued by you. Really? You can't deny you've had an effect on me. How can they not notice that, despite a few finer details being left out. And it has been just over a year. You keep putting it off. So she just wants to say hi? Yeah! Nothing too fancy. She's always been overprotective of me I guess. And I think she just wants to meet the person who's had such a... positive effect on me. [throw of the notebook on the table] [romantic music] Okay. Does it mean I can sing? I suppose so. Better get practicing my acclaimed dance routines then. A man of many talents aren't you? You better believe it. [music ends] I think you have that up just to remind my body it's had better days. No camera. Remember? It's over 40 years old now you know. And still my best work. How's it going? Um, not sure. What's the deadline? The date the council want it? Not til August. Which is great because I have the time, just not the inspiration. What's the theme? It's supposed to be something to look back on, for their annual local reflections festival. I'm surprised you're doing this for the council. You've never let anyone see your original work on a gallery exhibit. Not that I'm particularly complaining, since most of it is of my grotesque form. Heaven forbid I'm inflicted on an exhibit wall... nay the paying public. And why not? To me you are perfection. [Joe pretends to vomit] Not as I would though. I don't know... the ones of you. They've always been just for me. No one else. My own private exclusives. Well you have my permission. For what? If you ever change your mind one day. You had my permission to show them. But I thought you were canvas shy? Well the thing is, you're brilliant at this. You've got fans all over the world who love your work and I'd feel mortified if I was stopping them from seeing your complete talents. As long as you would still be my number one fan. You just try stop me from getting a front row seat. Now, how about we get you out and have a good walk around and see if any of that inspiration comes back to you. Haven't you got your appointment at the doctors though? Oh that's not till later this afternoon. We've got plenty of time. Now come on, it will do us some good to get some air, especially now springtime's upon us. Suppose you're right. Let me get my walking shoes then. You old ones had better keep up. Ho! There's only two years difference between us you know. As you keep reminding me. [box closes] [Joe takes a breath] [melancholic music] [noise of the cup on the floor] Oh. [Tom] What's that noise? Yeah. Fine, just knocked some brushes over with my towels. [Tom] Okay, don't worry about it. I'll sort it. Now remember, you've got your hospital appointment later today. Be sorted then. You'll see. I told you I'd do that! Are you sure everything is okay? Yeah. Fine. Tickety-boo and a half. Well I don't know, that's the problem. You haven't even said why you're going to the GP later. Oh, it's nothing. Annual mot as you do. Us fully retired lot need it more than you part-timers. Don't you know. [romantic music] I almost forgot just how beautiful this place was. Especially when it's quiet. Do you think it'll always be like this? You and me? Watching the world go by? I resigned myself to nothing but that a long time ago. Really? Well nearly two years with you now. How'd you expect me to imagine life any other way? Sorry. But you're stuck with me Sunshine. Can you imagine us in our old age? What? With your thinning hair and my continued startling good looks? Shut up! No, but seriously, can you imagine it? Us, years from now. What do you think we'll be doing? I don't know. I guess we'll have our own place. A quaint little house of our own. There'll be studio for me to work in and you'll have decorated the whole house in light colors. Warm all over. And in the kitchen... oh, in the kitchen! There would have to be a little table with a pot of tea on it. Every afternoon. That is a must. Very English of us... our duty! That sounds nice. Of course it would! Be ours that's why. It'll be difficult. I'm sure. [romantic music] The world is changing for the better. But it's not exactly screaming out for gay rights yet is it? It's just taking time to mature. And we just have to let it. Do you think it will change much? Well... technically, even though we're together, we have no rights. We'll never be seen as a proper couple recognized by law. Maybe so. But we still have the exact same feelings as anybody else who is proper. And that's always worth holding on to. You're too important for me to lose. Like I said before, you're stuck with me. Same here. But... I do hope the future is a better place. A more accepting one at least. And that it's treating our older selves better. Well, whatever life throws at us, no one's gonna stop me from looking after you. Not even when we're both dotty and too old to fend for ourselves. Through thick and thin I'd say. And sickness too, if we ever have to cross that bridge. Well... let's hope... that it never comes to that. [intriguing music] Joe. Joe. Come on through. [music stops] [door closes] Please, have a seat. Hi Doctor, how are you? Good, how are you feeling? Oh like anyone my age, a bit more tired, I'm more slow on my feet, but the mind is still in fine form. And how's Tom? Fine. Fine. All fine. He moans a lot, but then, that's never been a worry. It's a good result? I'm afraid it's not good news, Joe. [melancholic music] How do you mean? The MRI results came back. They show a growth on your lower spine. Can it... Can it be treated? If we caught this a year ago, 8 months even, we could have started a course of aggressive treatment. Chemotherapy, the works. As things stand, the most we could hope for is to keep you comfortable. If it is cancer, how long have I got? [sighs] Three, 4 months. Early August at best. Oh. Joe. Joe, would you like me to call Tom? Yes... I mean no. It's okay. I'm really sorry Joe. You're gonna need to tell your partner about this. The procedure is quite invasive. You are going to need some home rest. Thanks Doctor. [melancholic music continues] [Joe sobs] [rock music inside] Joe! Where have you been? Everyone's inside already. Sorry, uh, Tom was showing me some of his new art. Ethel, this is Tom. Very pleased to meet you Ethel Finally. I'm glad you've said that too. I was beginning to wonder whether you actually existed. It's been what? Two years since my brother first mentioned you. Happy to be seen then! Shall we go in? Lead away. [Joe and Tom gasp] [background chatter & pop music] Hey Ethel! Who's that cute guy with your brother? It's Tom. They've known each other a while now. He's brought the best out in our Joe. I'm grateful for that. So, a man of many talents? I wonder what other miracles he could perform? I have no idea. I've literally just met him. All I know more is, he's an artist. Sketches things I believe. Really? He could sketch me any time he likes! Mavis! You have a husband! Well, no harm in thinking. Or saying in your case! Go on, go find your fella! [music ends] Right! Tell Tom I say hello. [laughs] Actually have you seen them? Ugh... They went out the back I think, towards the garden. All right. I'll find him. See you sweet. [intriguing music] Joe? Tom? You out here? Joe? [dramatic music] Hey all ready? Yes. All ready to go. Sorry. We got chatting out the back and lost track of time. No, its alright. Really. You sure you're okay? Yes. I think I might have just had a bit too much. Well, we'll walk you home. Pa will kill me otherwise. Come on then my lady. [dramatic music fades out] - Tom! - What? Oh it's fine! You'll have the whole neighborhood back up. Oh let them! You know, I might give them a demonstration of my unique dance skills! Or lessons on how best to make an arse of yourself! Well I got to go this way. Well been a lovely evening! Make no mistake. Yes, It was enlightening. We'll have to do it again sometime. Right Ethel? Uh, yes I... Joe. I think she needs her bed and some sleep. I'll leave you both be. You sure you're gonna be okay getting home? Always. You know, it was very nice to meet you Ethel. I look forward to meeting you again. [Tom sighs] [Tom sighs] [kiss] See you tomorrow Joe. Will do. - And be careful. - Yeah. [melancholic music] Are you okay? Yes. Fine. Shall we? We better get home. Pa will kill us if we wake him up at this hour. Night then. [music stops] [radio plays in the background] You pair were in late again. Sorry Pa. So what you're doing today then? As little as possible I imagine. Morning to you to Pa. Enough of your cheek young man. You okay Joe? Yeah. I'm off to see Tommy today. Oh. I see. Tom again? You pair attached at the hip or something? We're just good friends, Pa. There's nothing wrong with that. Just good friends, Pa. [mumbling] [radio presenter] Good morning and welcome to the news. Plans to further so-called controversial gay pride events in London later this year will now be going ahead after government bodies passed the motion to allow them. This despite continued protest by anti-gay protests... Bloody puffs! Vile people! They should be shot or put down. Maybe they're fighting for equality. You know, something we all should have. It's not natural lad. It's a good job we know no one like that around here, or they'd have hell to pay! You mark my words! It's a brave new world Pa. As long as they keep their filthy mitts of you and the rest of us, I won't object. It might be a brave new world, but I don't have to agree with it! [melancholic music] Joe. Wait! You okay? You were a bit worse for wear... Joe, please! Is everything all right? You... you are... What. What am I? I saw you. Last night. You and Tom were... you were kissing one another! You are not normal. - I am... I'm not different! I'm still me! - No! Don't you come near me! I can't handle you touching me! I can't handle you! Please... Please don't push me away. You're my sister... I love you. You pushed me away the moment you became a dirty pervert! I'm not... Joe! Don't deny it! I saw you! You're gay! And so is Tom! [Joe] No... no. Pa? [music stops] [ring tone] [phone rings] Hello. Hello. Can I help? Is this one of those funny calls? Look I don't need this at the moment. - I'm very busy... - Tom? Ethel? Ethel, is that you? I... I was just calling to see if Joe's there, Tom. I'm afraid he isn't in at the moment. He should be back soon. He just popped to the doctors. Is he okay? As far as I know. I'm waiting for him to come back so he can tell me. Is everything okay at your end? Is it John? Has something happened to either of... We're fine. Thank you. Uh, I'll call again later. Goodbye. Where are you Joe? [waves and seagull sounds] [Joe exhales] How you feeling? Numb. End of an era. Or the start of a new one. I suppose you're right. He'll never accept this. Me... Us. Neither will. I saw the hatred in their faces! They were mortified! Disgusted! Maybe they're right. No! They're not! Not now. Not ever! You are the most kindest and caring person I have ever known. And I am so lucky to have met you! Yeah? You are going to be right here. For the rest of my life and I'll be there with you. You have my word. Remember you are my sunshine... even if there is none! The irony! Yeah, there's my Joe. I can only go back for my stuff. Unless Pa's already thrown it out into the street. Well then we'll go together. And we'll sort our lives out in the process. Me and you. Together like we should be. [romantic music] And we'll sort out jobs. We'll do anything. And we'll get that little house... yeah? A beautiful garden. We'll grow old together and moan when someone doesn't do the washing up. We've got everything to look forward to Joe. But... I'm gonna miss them. [Joe sobs] I'm gonna miss them with you. I told you, we're in this together. What affects you affects me... from this day on. Nothing is more important. [music stops] Sorry I've not been here for a while, Pa. Been busy and such and... I still never know if this is what you'd have wanted... me being here to visit. Plays on my mind more than you'll ever know. Maybe you do. I know this isn't the design you had for your son's life. [melancholic music] Can't lie and say it was mine too originally. It just happened. Maybe I'm clearing my conscience. Yet a part of me says there's nothing to appease or have to prove. But you'll always be my Pa. And despite not having to seen you after that day. Just thought you could give me a sign. That maybe I didn't do you too bad. I still love and respect you. In light of today's news. I just thought I'd let you know that. [music stops] [car rolling noise] [blinker sound] Uncle Joe! What are you doing here our John? I was out on some errands for my Mum when I saw you. Did you want a lift back? Hey! What's up Uncle Joe? [car door closes] Hey... hey. We can't have you like this now. Come on. [melancholic music] See you in about an hour then? Oh I'm so happy you are home! I was worried sick. I kept calling your mobile but you weren't answering. What's wrong? [music stops] Okay. What is wrong? Please, you're scaring me Joe. I promise I'll tell you very soon. I'm just waiting for one last piece of the jigsaw. I don't know what you mean. I don't understand. [distant front door knocking] Would you be a dear and go answer the door? Ethel... evening! Evening, Tom. What's all this about Tom? I tried to get something from John but... Told you Mom, I don't know what he's doing. I have no idea Ethel. It's a mystery to me. Won't you come in? [door closes] Ethel... John... Please. Sit down. I didn't mean for all this drama. Cloak and daggers. I didn't want to do this alone. But you aren't alone, I'm here. Begging your pardon though Tom my sweet. I meant I would have felt alone if you weren't all here. In this instance I needed you all in the same room. So Joe, why are we here? Before I tell you what I have to, there's some things I want to say. I don't want any more fighting. I've had more than enough to last me a lifetime. Tired of acting like it's all been okay. And that I've coped. When in reality it's been anything but. Ethel... Ethy. I never blamed you for what happened in the past. I never held your beliefs against you either. You have your ideals and that's fine... Pa did too. And Tom. My love, I'm so very proud of you. And whatever your reaction is to what I'm about to tell you. I want you to promise me that you'll always carry on with your paintings, and you will complete. The commission for the council's gallery. It's important to you, so, it's important to me. But... No buts. You will complete it. Promise me, please. I promise. As Tom knows, I had to visit my GP today. I'd had some blood tests earlier earlier. And today I went to see what they were telling us. I'm afraid it wasn't good. What did they say? [melancholic music] It's cancer. It started in my lower spine and spread before we knew anything was seriously wrong. It wasn't detectable till now, and it's too late to fix me. I'm afraid I don't have long left. Three or 4 months if I'm lucky. It'll be okay. I'll look after you! I promise! I know. I know. [music stops] [noise of dishes in the sink] Oh, damn it! Ethy and John got away. You haven't called her in that way, in a long time. They get off okay? Yeah. I wanted to give you some time alone together. It's been a lot to take in from all directions today. Oh, Tom. I'm fine! Stop being so bloody stubborn! Some things never change eh? Aye. Always have to have the last word. What you like? [melancholic music] I'd do anything not to be that person this time. Well, this is where you absolutely must be. Just this once. I can't do this though Joe. How am I supposed to carry on? All my life has been with you. No one else! I don't even think I could walk to the shop on the corner knowing you won't be here when I get back. Usually with the wrong milk. She called earlier. Ethel. Must have been before you asked John to bring you here. What did she say? Nothing much. Well she asked for you. It took a lot for her to pick up that phone I think. Made even worse when it was me who picked it up and not you. Thanks Pa. What? Just something I needed an answer to. I think I just got it. I don't understand? What you just told me... it answered a question I asked. One day at a time. One day at a time. [no audible dialogue] [music stops] [discrete crowd hubbub] Ladies and gentlemen. Honorable guests, good evening. I'm... I'm very grateful to be here tonight, and to have been asked to produce a piece of work for the festival that evokes the theme of looking back. And for a while, I struggled. I couldn't really grasp anything that captured my imagination, like things have at previous events and with my previous works. And then recently I... I received some news. News that was incredibly hard to digest, and that has affected me on a very personal level. [melancholic music] More so than anything ever has in my life up to now. And while I have been having to process and prepare for an even worse day to come. It made me look back on parts of my own life, and the intertwined life of someone very dear to me, who came along for the ride. And then it came to me. I realized I had looked to the past each day in my studio, to one specific picture on our walls. It was one of my first pieces of art, that holds a truly unique place in my heart. And I've never thought of showing it publicly before, because it has always been such a private piece for me. It was from a moment in my life when I finally knew, where I was going... and who would be with me, along the way. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your continued support, and may I close in saying, it took something in the present to make me look back and appreciate life even more, and those within it, that I hold very dear. And for that reason and to celebrate this event as best I can, I present... "My Joe". [romantic music] [applause] [music fades out] [zip] [steps on the parquet] Ethel, is Joe okay? Joe's fine, Tom. John's looking after him. Thank goodness. I actually came to see you. To have a private word. What can I do for you? I... I... this is hard for me. Ethel, I'm not really in the right frame of mind to get into any of this with you at the moment. I'll put on a happy face for Joe, but after... after what will happen, honestly, you'll not see me again. Is that what you think I want? Do you think I would leave you to deal with all this... your grief... alone? I'm not sure I know what you want of me. Of Joe. It's been many years and I'm just tired now. I can understand your reasons for distance. Things were very different back then. Ethel? I'm sorry. I'm sorry because tonight and every day since he told us about his condition, I've done nothing but wish I could have the time back again to get to know you better. Because I can see it all now. I can see how happy you've made my little brother. [melancholic music] I can see it in the days gone by and... I can see it now. It's never faltered. And I'd give it anything to take it all back. And to understand, instead of trying to forget that the two of you ever even existed. I hope one day you'll be able to forgive me, as does Joe. I think you underestimate your brother. There isn't a day that goes by when he doesn't mention you and your father. He's never stopped loving you. And neither have I. You don't know how much that means to me. Tom, I promise... you'll never be on your own. Not now, not ever, because... I came here to say something. Something I should have said a long time ago. Tom... you are my family too. [music stops] [Joe grumbles] Are you okay? Do you need any water? [laboured breathing] The... the hill... The hill? The hill? What do you mean my darling? [romantic music] I don't think I know what you mean. [laboured breathing continues] Hill. The hill. Our hill. Our first kiss. Then go there my love. Don't be afraid. Just let yourself go my love. I'll catch up with you someday. Oh, my sunshine. [melancholic music] [Joe] What time does the meteor shower start? [Tom] Any time now they said on the wireless. [Joe] So, where is Venus then? [Tom] Over there, brightest star in the sky. [Joe] So, that light is millions of years old. [Tom] Uh-huh. Yeah. [Joe] You know if, say a meteor was heading to Earth, and it was going to wipe us out... and all we had was a day left, what would you do with it? Well, I'd want to spend it with you, wouldn't I. But what if I wasn't there, with you I mean? Then... it'd be probably the saddest day of my life. Hey, look. It's just about starting.
