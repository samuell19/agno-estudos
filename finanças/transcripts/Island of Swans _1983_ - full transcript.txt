SWAN ISLAND Based on the novel by Benno Pludra Directed by Herrmann Zschoche Do you want to go to Berlin? And you? Would you want to? I don't think so. But it's a big city. There's a lot going on. Yeah. I know Berlin. But you've never been there. Go on... or they'll leave without you. I'll be back... 'cause we have to check in on Grandma. Typical! With Tasso again. - OK, he's here now. - Don't bother! The men want to leave. Dad's waiting. Don't whine at the last minute, girl. - Can we go now, young lady? - Yes, let's go. Bye, Grandma. Sabine, come on. Get in. - Bye, Grandma. - Bye, Sabine. OK. Mother, we'll visit as soon as we can. Bye! Take care! What'll Grandma do now? What she's always done: the house and garden, go to the grocery store. That's how it is when you have to leave somewhere. Did we have to? We finally have an apartment. If you want to be a family you should be together, and not just on weekends. Dad, you two and I. That's normal. It almost seems like you don't want to live with us. Look! There! Over there! All that light. So much light. Take this chair, then we can get to the box. It's falling! No sweetie, nothing's falling! Looks more like an Advent calendar. And up there Dad's waving! Look! Herrmann! You're finally here! Sabine thought the building was falling on her. Don't worry, nothing's falling here! Hi! How's it going? I'll take Sabine's bedding and we can go upstairs. Wait, I can take that. We've lived here for a while, on the top floor. Really? That's very nice of you. - What floor are you on? - Fourteenth. - Nice! - But you can't ride it alone. - Why not? - It's too dangerous. - How do they get the furniture in? - You can open it up. - Good luck in your new home! - Thank you. Yes, thank you. What a nice boy! Hello, hello, helloooo! Sabine! Come here. Look, this is your room. - Mommy! Mommy! - Go to sleep. - But I'm thirsty! - No, now it's too late. You'll get something to drink tomorrow morning, OK? - Where did you get that? - Tasso gave it to me. - Do you like it? - It's OK, I guess. - Going down? - Yes. We're stuck. No point, they're all broken. Possible... but dangerous. It was only a test, Stefan. No harm done. - Morning, Mrs. Brentina. - Good morning. - Hi, Hubert. Off to class? - Hi, yes. - Good morning. - Morning. - Goodbye. - Bye. Hey you! No, the other one. First of all: we say hello! New, huh? Second: We don't paint on the elevator walls! We don't paint in the stairwells or hallways! We don't paint on the building! We don't paint at all! We don't stick things on walls! We don't take anything apart! We don't let other kids into the building or spit on the floor! We report all irregularities to me, as head of the building community! We don't walk on the lawn! Got it? Hey! Tommy wait! He said he liked how you brushed off old Br√§mer. - Are you in Mrs. Meinelt's class? - Uh huh. - Hubert. - Stefan. Misha. Ah, you're the new kid! I'm Paris. - Guess we'll see a lot of you! - Could be. Morning. Anya. - I'm Mario. - Heidelinde. I'm sorry, my alarm clock. Stefan Kolbe? Alt Ruppin? - Warpin. - Warpin? - Alt Warpin. - Alt Warpin. OK, so now we are 8. Seven little monkeys were fighting late. One more joined, and now there were 8. One more joined, and now there were 8. OK, let's start. I know, kids, it's not about wanting to. We just have to, kids, we have to. Dear Tasso, Today is Sunday and I want to write to you. Here we live on the 14th floor. The building has 20 floors, but 14 is already enough. We have 4 rooms and it's warm too. Day and night it's warm, without making a fire. And there's a garbage chute. Hot water in kitchen and bath. All the modern conveniences, not like at Grandma's. Hey you. Something wrong? No. It's Sundays. There was a time I couldn't stand Sundays either. - And now? - Good for sleeping. - Your back again? - Just a bit. Where're the women? - One of them wanted ice cream. - And you? We wanted to go home and see Grandma today. - Yeah? Did we? - We said if there's time. And? My goodness, we're still unpacking! But there's enough time for sleeping and ice cream. - Is the elevator out again? - No, no. What are you doing here? I'm not allowed in. They lock me out on Sundays. But why? My dad has to study. And my mom studies too. - And what if you have to study? - I don't. What if it's raining? It's not raining. It's warm and dry in here. - What if you need to go? - I don't. - It's stuck again. - It was just working. That's a bit too mini. She's going up to the drying attic. She can walk up. I'm thirsty. Leave that alone! Monika! Hubert! Wait! Slow down! Pretend nothing's happened. If we run, everyone'll know that something's wrong. Don't turn around! Come on. It's warmer here. Do squats! Use your arms! Come on! Do it! Dammit! Dammit! They're pumping it out. The power units in the basement - apartments, furniture, carpets. And Bremer - he'll call the cops. I can't go home. If my dad finds out... Nobody knows. - I've never snitched on anyone. - Never? Don't worry, you can go home. I can't go home - my clothes! You have to leave here, or you'll catch a cold. At home we would've made a fire. Stay here! - Where? - Here. Looks like a prison here. I finally know what a drying attic is good for. A pug came into the kitchen, stole an egg from the cook... This is taking forever! Get dressed. We're going. We won't be this lucky again. - I can't go home. My dad... - Does he hit you? No! He's an editor at the newspaper. It gave him ulcers. You've got to go easy on him - or he collapses! - Come on, put this on. - Anyway, there're two of us. - So? - Two's always better. - But I turned the hydrant on! - Does anyone know that? - I am soaked. - Because you tried to turn it off. - Because what? Because you tried to turn it off. I turned it on, and you tried to turn it off. You'd say that? What's your dad do? He's a construction worker. Right next door. Made it! You're shivering. Are you cold? You're soaked. Never mind. I've never told on anyone, right Hubert? So much water! There's water everywhere! - Yeah, I know. - Where've you been? Dad did... Dad went and turned it off. - Dad? - Yes, in his swimsuit! Someone turned it on. I think it was some boys. You think so? - Hey. - The hero of the day! Whoever did this is an idiot. Do you know how much pressure that kind of hydrant has? - Yes. - 6 kilos per square cm. Do you know what that means? Yes. Say, I always see a guy with glasses hanging around. It was me. - What? - Oh no! I wanted to see if any water would actually come out. - What were you thinking? - You just heard! Boy. - And, did it come out? - Yes, it did. - And then? - I took off. - You got scared! - Herrmann. You got scared and took off! Oh, God. Guess all's well now! He turned it on. I turned it off. Done! I have a lot to tell you, Tasso. When I come, I'll tell you stories for hours. Or you come. Come and visit. Yours, Stefan. Take your seats! Well, we have a problem. You know the facts, as you live in the building. And there's the culprit! Makes you wonder... ...what makes a person cause such malicious damage. On a Sunday. His guilty conscience made him stand up. And now we'd like to hear something from you, Stefan. A statement. This is pointless. We'll talk about it later. I want to talk about it now. The case is important enough. He should tell us what he was thinking. Did you know what you were turning on? A hydrant. Even painted red. He's been living in a village. They don't have hydrants there, so he wouldn't know what can happen... We had two, just not red. So you did know. That makes the case sad. Very sad. Do you know how high the damages are? Mrs. Meinelt, please register a demerit. OK. Let's get back to grammar. I don't get it. You knew what it was, but still turned it on. And we had to mop up. The country bumpkin's letting it all hang out here. I think it's great. We should open all the hydrants in the building. - Why didn't you turn it off again? - You try turning that off! I couldn't have done it. The important thing is your parents are insured. - OK, I need to go... - ...pick up my sisters. - Yours too, right? - Later. - I have to do the dishes. - I have lessons. - I guess I have to go shopping. - Me too. - I have to go to the cleaners. - About time! I wanted to confess, but couldn't. Have you ever been rafting? I can still turn myself in, if you like. - At home Tasso and I had a raft. - I wonder why that bastard talked. - With a sail and a cabin. - He only told on you. We're going next Sunday. You can come with us. He wants something from me. He's planning something. - Nonsense. What then? - Something. - Look up there! - Your dad? Yeah. - Does he hit you? - Nah. Are you OK? My back again. But if I stand like this, it's OK. - Can I help? - No, I'm fine like this. - When'll Mom get home? - No idea. If there's an accident, she won't be back before midnight. - I'll call her. - No, don't. I'm good like this. - What's it from? - No idea. - Could've lifted a board wrong. - Or caught cold from the water. - Anything happen at school? - Yeah, I got a demerit. I told the superintendent you did it. That was the best thing, right? As soon as we get to Berlin, all this crap starts! What's wrong with you? - Any news? - And you? Terrible accident. Both legs. 14 years old. Just be careful here. - And Bine? - She's sleeping. At least she should be, but she may be waiting for you. In kindergarten they say she never takes a nap. - Does she bother anyone? - Probably. - When are we going? - Going? Oh, very soon... I just need some peace and time to catch up on sleep ...maybe a whole weekend. And I have to look after Bine and your dad. Night. Sleep tight. - How was it? - How was what? - On the raft. - We didn't even go. - Play something! - Don't be silly. - Did something come up? - Yeah. - Do you actually like playing? - As much as throwing up. - Then stop. - I can't. I have to. Throw the case in the water. Let's see if it floats. Who are you always scared of? What do you mean scared? I turned on the hydrant! - Aren't you ever scared? - If I'm in the right? Here, hold this! Here. Kippers. - You wouldn't have done that. - Why would I want to? What a clown! I'll throw them in the water! I have to go to my lesson. - You two are such clowns. - I'm sorry. - Thanks, but I don't need any. - Me neither. Maybe your buddy? Show me! Do you have cats? - No. - It's not allowed. The fish end up in the trash and stink. So get rid of them right away. Good afternoon, Doctor! Good afternoon! - What's this? Do you fish? - Not here, but at home. - What should we do with them? - Get rid of them. We could make fish soup at my place. Not in the elevator! You already have quite a record. Huh, for the fish tank? - Dead fish. - Come on! - Eight or fourteen? - Eight. I have to talk to you. I'm alone here. Aunt Annelie doesn't mind visitors. Are there still stamps on them? - Do you collect them? - ...my friend at home. If you like I can keep them for you. - Thanks. - Have a seat. My mother, 2 girlfriends, 2 boys and my dad write to me. - From where? - From Baghdad. Why are you here? I got too old for the embassy school. - What... - My dad's a trade councilor. But he isn't in trade at all, it's just his title. Is something bothering you? Maybe the title? - Does it bother you? - I'd have to think about it. - Where is your Alt Warpin? - North. Look there, that's west! When the weather's clear, you can see the radio tower. - Do you know the radio tower? - No. It used to be the radio tower, before there was any TV. Now it's in the west. What's there, in Alt Warpin? An island, swans, fishermen. You wanted to tell me something? Now you know. Well, little Hubert? Are your parents studying again? Tell me... you still believe in the stork and stuff. Leave him alone. So, why do mommy and daddy lock you out all the time? Huh? He locks the door 'cause he gets home late all week and is so tired... Cut it out! ...and has no time to take care of your mom. He doesn't know she cheats on him during the week. But Sundays, he's getting it on with her. That's when he wants to have sex with her. You bastard! - Get this rat off of me! - What rat? - Stop him! - Hubert! - I'm going to kill him! - Gotta catch him first. You take the other doors. Don't let them through, then drive them upstairs! Let the shithead come! - There are 4 of them! - The 2 of us, right? We have to be careful not to get pushed upstairs. It's too high. Come here. Hubert. Hello. Fun on the construction site? What's going on here? Just taking a look. - There's a fine for trespassing. - For whom? - For whom? For the parents. - But you work here. You should've had your fill, with that hydrant. I wanted to see how things are going here. Tomorrow I see the doctor so I can go back to work. I have to go. This is Hubert, who lives in our building. Yeah, so? Off to school? You're late. I wanted to see your dad, because of this here. It was expensive. I want to see what he thinks and get paid for the damage. Or to see your mom. Is she here? - No! - Do you have west Marks? It's clear the jacket's irreplaceable. But let's say 500 east Marks. Plus something for the cleaners, pain and suffering. Then we'll see. That'll cover my not telling your parents. I don't have 500. Well, I'm not a monster. Let's do it this way: 5 Marks a week in installments and we're good. You can take a break when you're broke, but with interest. No! OK. Friends? There you go! What's all this here? This is our playground! Got a problem with it? Playground? These holes are death traps! Come on, help! We'll fill them up! Come on. Stefan, your sweet Rita's here! Come on over, Stefan! You're not allowed, right? Daddy says no. Hey! Stop it! Someone dug this hole and forgot to fill it! That's irresponsible! Soon there'll be a new playground, but first the holes have to go! With a jungle gym? With a jungle gym and all! Completely modern! Jungle gyms are boring. We want our tunnel - we built it ourselves. - What tunnel? - Down there! I tell you, these are death traps! Do you know what could happen with such soft soil and no supports? You could be buried alive! And we at the site would be responsible! You could leave the tunnel - with pipes for support. The pipes are for the drainage system. Should we help, Mr. Kolbe? Yes, of course! No! Wait! You'll get your tunnel - a whole network, if you help! - Who are you? - I'm from the construction site. Are you a worker or boss? A worker - a pipefitter, to be precise. OK, get over here! We still have to elect our Party Youth officers. With only 8 of us? We're already late. OK, who'll be Secretary? Stefan? Me? I'm new here. I mean, who do you nominate? Please not me. I have to deal with a single mother and 3 sisters. We're social misfits, lots of kids, et cetera! What about you? What do we actually need? The secretary, deputy, clerk, cashier, culture, sports and... You all take the positions and I'll be the group. Don't be silly! It must be done. OK, who's already held a position? - Culture. - That's more something for Hubert. OK, Heidelinde for culture. Who's in favor? Next. Now me. I was deputy. - Who's for Rita being deputy? - To whom? To the secretary! And who will that be? You can't just elect a deputy... Typical country bumpkin. - Rita as secretary? - Fine, if you want. - And Hubert will be cashier. - I can't take a position. - Don't start again. - You can do it! I turned on the hydrant. - Oh boy. - What? You? Sit down for now. - If it was you... - It was me! If it was really you, why did Stefan say he did it? Because Hubert got scared! I am talking to no one but Hubert and Stefan! You don't want to tell us? We both did it. I turned it on and ran away. I was scared. - See! - Always the same tune! What do you want, actually? He told the truth. I think that's brave. Stefan, wait a second! OK, I'm going now. Hey, I'm going into the city. Want to come? This is the city, this is the city... The only city that has everything. We're in love with you. I'm in love with you. The city is so deep, as deep as the woods... It smells like asphalt and takes hold of you hard. We have a crush on you. I have a crush on you. You only have to touch it, touch me, to feel the vibration. We were born here. We are lost in you. Just touch me. Just touch me. Look, there's Hubert. What's going on? - Why are you doing this? - Because I need money. You play like a pro. Hey, Hubert, could you do us a big favor? Would you pick up Sabine from kindergarten? Just today? - OK. - You're a sweetie. Come on! - Good afternoon. - Hello. Stop fooling around. Just so you know I mean it. Think about it! This was our building. Number 51. It's slated to be torn down. They bricked it up. Come on. Have you always lived in Berlin? Your whole life? Yeah. And my parents and my grandparents and so on. - This was my room. - So you're a real Berliner. - Of course. And you? - Pasewalk. If you take me, you'll become a Berliner too. Something wrong? My first boyfriend lived over there. Brandy. He was blond too. Evenings, we could see into each other's room. My bed was here. What are you doing? Man, I was a kid back then. Come. I have to go. - You didn't pick me up! - Whether it's Hubert or me... - Nobody picked me up! - Are you nuts? Mrs. Hortmann brought me home. Try this one! I can't stand that kind of thing. I was just roaming around a bit. - A bit where? - Downtown. In the city. We agreed you'd pick up Sabine. Didn't we? Yeah. - The tea's still warm. - Later. Good I ran into you. I think your friend Hubert has a problem. Hubert! Hubert! - Hubert? - Here. I'm not giving that bastard another Mark. Milk for our invalid and cola for our guest. - Thank you. - But no swapping! You're going out? I have to - really. Anyway you have company. I might be late tonight. Tell Dad, if he gets home early, - though I doubt he will. - And if he does? - Stay in bed. Goodbye! - Goodbye. Sometimes I can't stand her when she leaves like this. Can you understand? - But if she has to go? - Yeah, yeah. And what will you do now? Sick. I'll just be sick. Until he loses interest. - What else can I do? - Man, just smack him! - No, I want no part of that. - One day you'll die of fright. So I'll die then. From now on you're not going anywhere alone. We'll always go together. Got it? Do you know this one? A seagull sat on the Spree River. A reporter came and asked: Mrs. Seagull, why aren't you by the sea? The seagull said: Me? No way! Still, I wish I were a seagull. You'd just take off whenever you wanted. For that you'd spend your whole life as a seagull? I have to go to the bakery and then the cleaners. You won't beat him by always sticking together. One day, he'll catch Hubert. And then? - Are you going with her or not? - Was there anything else? - We can't always be together. - Come on! So who's going with whom now? Hubert's going with Stefan, right? OK, I have to go. My sisters... Don't start with your sisters again! Just bring them with you! Then I'll go with Paris. - I can also go alone. - I'll go with you two. Look at her! Who dresses like that? Why? I think it looks good. - Nonsense! That's out. - You just have to hem it... - That looks good, doesn't it? - Nah, she looks stupid. - Where's Hubert? - In the recycling room. - I like those glasses. - They look OK. - Would you wear them? - Sure, they look cool. - Looks like it was worth it. - I guess so. Hey there! Working hard? Look. Here it looks better. Beautiful lady, huh? Are those bottles and papers from the recycling room? Yes. But there's more. - These are all from me. - Oh, thank you Mr. Br√§mer! Hold on - thanks? Why thanks? They're all mine. I was only storing them there, so put them back. We couldn't have known. Well, next time remember. And now put it back. - OK, here. - Thank you. Can you survive the separation? - I'll do the rest up here. - I'll join you. Three people, that's dumb. It'll take forever. - Go with him. - Why don't you go with him? Don't you think I know you two have something going on? I don't send him little notes! And I don't hang out with him in old buildings. Who drew him into her apartment? To make fish soup! - Prenzlauer Berg goat! - Diplomat's spoiled brat! This is stupid. We both have a crush on the same guy. - Right? - Uh-huh. It happens. I have nothing against you. - And you? - Me neither. - So, let's keep it that way. - What do you mean? One time me, one time you. Or the three of us. Can't all three of us go for a walk or into the city? Or listen to music or whatever? It's worth a try. But what about the others? They won't figure it out. So? It'll be hard. Stefan! Come here! What? They're doing something down there. Listen! Where? Wait a second. There it is again. - Did anything happen? - No. Let's run down! Come back! It's about time! - Something wrong? - No. Wasn't there something about a tunnel and pipes? Yeah. - Maybe they're already in there. - Doesn't look like it to me. No use crying, everything will work out. Let's go back! - So, what's with the tunnel? - How should I know? Will there be one or not? The pipes may already be in there. - You don't believe that yourself. - Ask someone else. I thought your father was the one. - So? - Come on. What are you doing here? I just want to see what's up with the tunnel. Oh man! It's coming! We don't have pipes now! What? What's he want with pipes? I said a tunnel would be good for the playground! They're leveling the ground! We'll talk later. Go away now! We have our deadlines to meet. They're not open for discussion. First we meet our goals, then we can build it. There's no other way. I have no more time now! - Are you two coming? - In a minute. Oh, I see. Stefan. Are you waiting for someone? - Shall we go? - I'm waiting for Hubert. You don't have to wait. - You don't want us to? - I'm just saying. Then we'll wait. You should get a different hair cut. - Do you agree? - Yeah. No bangs and a little longer in the back. And longer over the ears. Or really short. It's pretty dry. Right, Rita? Feel it! Good morning to you, ladies. Are you waiting for Hubert? Well, where is he? Aren't you curious? I put him out. He's on the sixth floor. - Did he do that? - No way. He's bluffing. But he has nice hair. WE DON'T WANT A CONCRETE PLAYGROUND! WE WANT A TUNNEL AND LITTLE MEADOWS! -THE KIDS You there, come over here! - Did you do this? - No. Did you post this? So why are you hanging around here? - We're waiting. - Ah! For something to happen, huh? - For a buddy. - Ah! For a buddy. We don't play anymore. Meadows! That's for little kids. I'd like to know who posted it, if not you? You were here, and yesterday it wasn't up! Yes, yes, first the hydrant and now this. What does this have to do with the hydrant? Everything always has something to do with something! We know our troublemakers... but no one can tell us their name. - Kolbe. - Excuse me? - My name is Kolbe! - And now you get cheeky! This is a building community board. The leadership group... I decide! - ...and my dad as well. - In this case, it's me! - Why not put it next to the board? - Out of the question. Then maybe someone would read it. Well, you're part of it. - So, who's read it so far? - No one at all! I tell you, there will be consequences. - Something wrong? - And you? Are you OK? - Why? - Because of Windbreaker! Oh, I always take the stairs now. WE DON'T WANT CONCRETE! WE WANT A TUNNEL AND MEADOWS. Did you guys post the sign? That's not how things work. We can talk about everything, but not like this. It definitely wasn't you, and you don't know who did it? You can't always get what you want. But you're reasonable. You were just painting something. I had to wait for years before getting an apartment awarded to me. Thing's aren't so easy. Oh, so this is what's going on! You let me talk, but you're already done! You're making a fool of me! I thought: I should talk to you, to all of you! And now another sign! I'm done trusting you! Stabbed in the back! That's the truth! You think I'm stupid, or what? Could I use your knife please? So what'll we do at Grandma's all day long? By the time we get there, it'll already be noon. And Grandma's been waiting for us to visit since we moved. OK. I was just asking. What are you doing with the money? ...from collecting recyclables? Is it for a good cause? - For a birthday. - Yeah! For yours, right? Hopefully for the playground. Stop it with your playground. Tunnels and little meadows! That sounds nice. What do you have against it? Nothing. But not like that. Little meadows... this is a city, a metropolis with other laws. As a city person you should understand. A city person from Alt Warpin! I'm a construction worker. My father was a carpenter, my grandfather a mason. We built everywhere. We didn't bother with little meadows. - Or with tunnels. - Right! Or with tunnels! Dammit! Am I surrounded by idiots? Are you trying to ruin our day? Me? Why? Just leave me at home. Of course. How'd I guess? You don't want to go anyway. Bine, please go away. I want to talk to Dad. - Come on, go. - Oh, man. Out of nowhere you start a fight with the boy. - And you tore up his sign. - The sign, yes. Maybe you could tell me the reason behind all that! They're arguing. Would you draw me a sheep? - Draw it yourself. - Please! I imagined our life here a bit differently. I thought our family would be happier here. Is it the apartment? Hot water, central heating... Think how it was at Grandma's. Taking the bus every morning at 6, lighting the stoves beforehand and all the rest of it! - We spent more time together. - Yes, on the weekends! - But here I miss some things. - Like what? Look at Stefan. Don't you see it? He's missing things he had there. There he and Tasso lived like bandits! He'll never get anywhere like that! You see what's become of him! Why are you criticizing the boy? Man, this babbling annoys me! Always back and forth! - Are we leaving now or not? - No, we're not! Not like this, we're not! Well, Hubert? Now it's 40 Marks. I'm waiting. For now. 500, Hubert. You've got the jacket on again. Well observed... but it's patched. It's not perfect anymore. You won't get another cent from me. I'm sure you'll change your mind. And I'll remember your mug too. Same goes for your mug. - Shithead! - Super shithead! - You'll get what you deserve! - So come on! Hey! They're laying concrete! Concrete on our playground. - On Sunday? - Maybe an extra shift. CONSTRUCTION SITE! DO NOT ENTER. PARENTS LIABLE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. - What are those? - Maybe the little meadows. No, not the trees! Stop! Leave the trees! Stop! Leave the trees! You must stop! Hubert! Wait! Hubert? - Where's Hubert? - I don't know. I find it sad about the trees. Little kids don't know any better. - Still. - We'll plant new ones. Stefan! Stefan! So, is this the prize? Is this how you want your playground to look? - Get out! Get going! - Bye. - Get out! - Don't touch me! Have I ever hit you? Hubert? Hubert! Keep quiet. Don't move. Huh? I warned you that you'd get what's coming to you. Who's the shithead now? Who's the shithead now, huh? Who is the shithead? No! Subtitled by Katrin Bahr and Christopher Hench ¬© 2016 DEFA Film Library, University of Massachusetts Amherst
