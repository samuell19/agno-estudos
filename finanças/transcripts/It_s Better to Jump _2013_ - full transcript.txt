- I remember when I was eight years old, I drowned. We were playing swords, it was winter, and the waves were so high, and I had coats, and I was sweating, and we were playing swords, and I fell. The waves used to, you know, push me to the walls and back, push me to the walls and back. I took for people 20 minutes, and I almost drowned and I almost was dead. I suffered a lot, but still, I faced the sea, I faced the water, and I think this is the bravado thing to do. - The history of Akka began 4,500 years ago. I am Canaanite before being Palestinian. - Akka became a symbol of the verges of the modern Palestine, because it was a coastal city that interacted with the outside world in a vigorous trading relationship. It was also the seat of a succession of rulers, who really maintained this great walled city as a seat of power for an area that they governed that spread from what is today Lebanon, all the way to Gaza. - The Akka wall was there to Europe, essentially, but to others as well. Don't ever think about doing the Crusades again, in this area, because we've built a really amazing wall that will withstand just about any attack. - Many people think of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict like the Hatfields and the McCoys, two different parts of town with a dividing line, and they're fighting over space, but it's not like that, it's like somebody coming into your house, and occupying your living room, putting you in your bathroom, and then wanting a part of your bathroom, and then another part of your bathroom, and sort of squeezing you out altogether. It's not a question of can two people learn how to live together, it's the fact that the driving force of this conflict is the absolute denial of the political rights of one group to have self-determination and the right to live as a people. - To thank the Assembly of the United Nations for granting the Jewish Agency for Palestine a hearing, when we speak of the Jewish state, we do not have in mind any racial state, or any theocratic state, but one which will be based upon full equality and rights for all inhabitants without distinction of religion or race, and without domination or subjugation. - Palestine becomes the only Arab country that was colonized that does not achieve independence. Instead, is transformed into another country, overwhelming majority of its population forced out of their homes. - This process moves at a tectonic plate speed often: one inch at a time, one person at a time, one house, one family, one community, but, at certain times, these tectonic plates sort of jump, like in an earthquake. 1948 was like that, 1967 was like that, which you see this place with certain populations and been partitions of walls or borders being imposed to separate them. This is really the dark side of maternity, but this is the most documented case of colonial occupation ever, and it's also one that we're not just studying because it happened, it's one that is still happening. - We've been here since 1,300 years ago, and even before 1948, we had Jewish Palestinians, Christian Palestinians, and Muslim Palestinians, and that wasn't an issue, because it's not about religious conflict, as they try to portray it, it's a matter of turning a religion into a nationality, and then claim a land in the name of that nationality or religion. - The overall objective of the Zionist movement has not changed in 100 years, and that is to turn an Arab Palestine into a ethnocracy, really, a Jewish only space, if possible. - It's not a matter of stubbornness, "I'm here, and you're not gonna get rid of me, I'm staying." It's a matter of connection to the place. You have this connection that you have to your home, to your family members. - My family has been in Akka more than 200 of years, many generations. - Even though they can say "My grandfather, "great-great-grandfather", and go back hundreds of years, as far as the government is concerned, and as far as Jewish-Israeli population is concerned, they really don't belong there and should just get out of the way. So, they're treated as such, and thus, they feel as foreigners, unwelcome, almost like legal migrants. - I all the time remember my relatives, my people who lived, and I remember the sound of my mother singing about those who left, those who are absent. - The Old City of Akka who was just a very beautiful historic place is being transformed, cleansed of its Palestinian population. - There's this program, this plan, late '70s, beginning '80s to evacuate the Old City and to turn it into some sort of an European artistic village, with very beautiful houses, very expensive houses. Only if you had a lot of money, you could come and live here, and that is very tempting, because this city is very beautiful and it has a lot of potential. It has succeeded partially. In '95-'96, they were 8,300 Arabs in the Old City, and now, there are only 3,900-4,000. - This is the place that I grew up, and we had a lot of suggestions for people who wanted to buy it, and, emotionally, we were not able to be disconnected from it. - I think that the demographic issue is always an issue, especially in mixed cities, and especially in Akka. Ethiopians and the Russians, the new comers were put to reside in Akka. So, when you bring them to a municipality or to a jurisdiction that is already suffering, in my eyes, it just makes things worse. You need to put them with a strong population, so they could merge in it, not bring a lot of poor populations altogether and just let them die together, or let them suffer together, and I don't think any municipality can put up with such needs. - You are afraid that this place will not be for you. You feel that many places changed, the citizens, the owners. So, they changed everything. - In the case of Akka, with the arrival of Jewish-Israeli settlers from Gaza, that's not unusual. You have large groups of Jewish immigrants, whether they come from Russia, or they come from the Arab world, or elsewhere, who are brought in all the time to increase the Jewish population. This process really can reach surreal proportions. - In 2006, the disengagement from Gaza, they brought a lot of people from there to reside in Akka, and that changes it, not only demographically, but also environmentally, let's call it, because you're bringing very unique group into a mixed city. It doesn't fit together. There's a mixed city where Arabs and Jews are living together, I can't say at 100% peace, but there was some sort of a piece going on for a lot of years, and when you bring a fanatic ideological group into that existence, or into that reality, things will start happening, bad things in my idea will start happening. - On the other hand, the Old City doesn't have a lot of facilities. It has one dentist clinic, it had one medical clinic. So, people who wanted to make their lives easier and better, they left, so I can't say everyone was forced to leave, but if you need people to be happy about where they're living, you need to give them services, so their lives would be like everyone else, not just keep it closed, and keep it dirty, and let them cook in their own dirt, as we say, and people will leave by themselves. - And that is a way of slowly emptying an entire neighborhood, then opening it up for investment by Jewish entrepreneurs. And so, they're living under a specific set of rules, which really control what permits they can have to repair their homes, build their homes, or even destruct homes, what areas are allowed to live in, not allowed to live in. That is the model, really, the original model for how the Israeli government has dealt with Palestinians under occupation. - I would hate to see this city becoming some capitalist, foreign investors' city, where everything is beautiful, everything is clean, everything is just tip-top, and empty of its own citizens, empty of the Arab citizens. I always said that people of Akka need to invest in their own houses, in their neighbors' houses, to help this city become the city that it needs to be. I think, at some point, I was like "Okay, I'm gonna stop talking and start doing." - You have a situation of slow death, a choking of a population, destroying its economy, piece by piece, dismantling it, dismantling the social structure, laying siege to an entire population, warehousing the population, in areas with checkpoints, and inability to move, to get medical care, or go to school, et cetera, and it's done one little checkpoint at a time, one little housing permit approved or disapproved at a time. It doesn't strike people as extermination. In fact, it's happening in a way that's really under the radar screen of what people are sensitized to to be real important abuses or human issues that they should care about, and I think that's part of the tragedy and part of the design, so to speak. It is very difficult for people to bring attention to these issues, partly because they don't have the vocabulary that they need to really convey the kind of horrible, slow torture, death of a society is really like. - You have to jump, otherwise, you would never know if you would fail or not. - Amidar is the governmental housing company. Big part of the houses is owned by Amidar, and the family only owns 60% of that property. It doesn't own the full 100%. So, what happened in the last few years, they offered whoever wants to buy the house that he's living in can do that. Now, you say that's a very nice thing to do, that's very good, but on the other hand, when a family is unemployed and has a lot of debts, it cannot buy the remaining 40% of their house. - And this is where the tycoons come here, and they offer a very good price for their houses. So, if you can't fix your house, and you can't renovate, and you can't live there, so, basically, you are forced, you are being cornered into selling your own house, even if you don't want to. - You see, they are building everywhere. Look at this ugly place. I mean, in the middle of... By the wall, they build a youth hostel. Look, no character, no nothing. I mean, what is this? It is something so insensitive, and you know what struck me? I felt what is an invasion. It's not army, it's not tanks, it's not airplanes, it's not a big war, it's occupation. They occupied the grounds of my childhood, of my town, with a different culture. It's a cultural invasion, it's as if it's throwing all your history, all your upbringing, all your childhood, everything, it's like and this is terrible. The municipality here, they sold this ancient historic place for $12 million. Out of that Khan El Umdan they want to make a big hotel out of this site, and this is terrible. - If somebody offers them like a million shekels for an old house, how can they say no? - They're really, really poor, they live under really, really difficult conditions. - Like you have seven people living in one room. - It doesn't fit our way of life, the locals here, and they are paying so much money for teeny-tiny one room, two rooms in the dark, in the dungeons, you know, and giving people money. - And we are survivals, but the politics and the surroundings, big powers around you, you can't do anything. - And Akka is just one of many examples of how cities, and towns, and the whole landscape, really, has been transformed as a result of this government policy of Judaization, but in the case of Palestine-Israel, this process of creating Jewish only spaces at the expense of the native population is indeed, a very stark one. - In the coming 10 years, it's going to be one of the most expensive places in the world, so touristic, so commercial. I could foresee what's gonna happen here to this town. It's an intentional, focused plan which the authorities are trying to do here, which means most of the Arabs are going to leave. It has been, since 1948. - This accountabilization, really, of the history, the architecture, the landscape of one of the oldest, most beautiful cities in the world. - So, each period has its certain problems. In the '50s and '60s, there were very crucial problems at that time. The Palestinians left to the Arab countries, and became refugees. Us, we stayed here, we remained here, where we belong, in our places, in our homes, in our land. - Palestinians living under occupation are living under different legal regime than those living normally as citizens of Israel, within the green line of 1948, and those two are living in different legal situation from Palestinians who live in Jerusalem, who are natives of Jerusalem, who are under a third kind of microlegal regime, and those three are living in a very different situation from those at Gaza, which the Israeli government has withdrawn from, but yet surround it in a siege, and they control everything from entry of fuel, to water, to goods, and that's a different legal regime from the ones that Palestinians live under, who are refugees living outside of Israel. They themselves were Palestine and they themselves differ from each other. - But after graduating our school, they might go to negative ways, like "I'm a big guy now, I can deal with drug, "I can deal with violent, I'm a gang member." They might find themselves on the streets, not in the University, not working even. So, this is very, very dangerous, and I think as education leader we have to figure how to help them after graduating our schools. - I hate to see these kids just growing up in the streets. I mean, we grew up in the streets as well, but I had somewhere to go to, I had parents who directed me to go to a certain path in my life, but when you go back to your house, and there's nothing you can do after school, that's a problem, people get bored. You know, kids get bored. So, you start looking for things to make your life much more interesting, and interesting is dangerous. - You know, the population of kids right now is getting severe problems, the lack of circles that can give them extra education, after the school. - They're trying really to do things, they express themselves by trying to do extraordinary things, like being the best soccer player in the area, or the best singer. - Our first song, it was about Akka, our city, because we love it, and we love the people here. And so, we just talked to the young people that they shouldn't just use drugs, they should go and learn, and about the poor people, that they should have faith, and hope, and about the government here, how they treat us as Arab. They don't treat us even with the Jews. - And here, it's even more evident, and it reflects more in a mixed city. I love the Old City so much, but for me, I feel for Arabs it's like a ghetto. You can't renovate your house, you can't do anything to improve your life. So, if you wanna improve or progress, you would have to move out. - If you decide that you wanna live abroad for a couple of years, it's gonna be really hard for you to come back. You're in a somewhat of a dilemma, you don't wanna give it up, but you also want a better life. - It's a matter of the collective. It's not an individual matter. So, if I improve only myself, and I work only on myself, and I gain, I don't know, a higher salary, and then I'm the only one enjoying from this salary, then it's not really change. I haven't changed, I haven't influenced anything, I haven't improved anything. - It's true that the conditions here are not very ideal or are far from ideal, but we do realize that we have also a responsibility to make a change. - For good or for bad, this is my home. This is my home, my country, even if I disagree with many political issues, but this is my home. - Nowadays, it's more of a modern racism. You don't feel it, nobody says really "I'm racist, I don't like this person.", but you can feel it in people's attitude, and their behavior, and the fact that you don't have many options here, even though you're talented, and you're qualified, and you see that Jewish people might not have the same qualifications as you, but they get better options. They're trying to make you feel that you don't belong here. You feel immigrant in your own home. That's what I feel. - Saying "I'm a Palestinian, not an Israeli.", some people will tell you "Why don't you go "and live in the West Bank or Gaza?", and then you have to explain to them why, for you, this is Palestine, and this is home. - It's terrible for Palestinians who are deeply rooted to a particular area, or home, or town to be made to feel that they don't belong. It's almost a little bit like... "It's such a small place, can't we "just have it as our home?", and you can just go anywhere in Africa, cause you're black. There's this special connection, historical, religious connection that Jews have with Palestine that makes them feel that this is the land promised to them by God, and it's not just an arbitrary spot that they chose out of nowhere. And so, when you add to that the layer of neo-extinction of an ethnic and religious group as a result of the genocide of World War II, then you get this really redoubled effort to make sure that this place belongs to them and only to them, and everybody else is just not welcomed. Of course, it's very convenient to design this project, that actually, this country has been inhabited by a native population for hundreds of thousands of years, but that's the way it is, yeah. - There's already this national barrier, because, after all, this is a Jewish state. It is very difficult for Arabs, in general, for men and women to get ahead in this country, to get a better job, to get a better education, because basically, the government prioritizes Israelis over Arab citizens. - Many of my friends also are educated, and have first degrees, and second degrees, and it's really hard for them to find jobs here, because they're Arabs, they get rejected, or they're being looked at as suspicious, or dangerous, or something like that. - I know doctors and physicians who work in constructions, renovations, and stuff, and they drive taxis, lawyers who studied, and have a degree in law, and they drive taxis. - Also, at my workplace people come to me and say, once they know that I'm Arab, they were like "No way! You're Arab? You don't look Arab." So, how am I supposed to look exactly, remind me? I don't know what they expected, but maybe they expected a veil, maybe they expected something else, I don't know, but Arabs are diversified. Some of us are religious, some of us are not, some of us are educated, like people. - So, I'd like to see Arab students and Arab high schools receiving the same investments, and funds, and programs, and empowerment programs as any other Israeli-Jewish kid and Jewish-Israeli high school. - And I think that, in order for that to happen, something really drastic has to change in this country, and I think the definition of it, as a Jewish country here sets the barrier for non-Jewish citizens. - It really makes a big difference in people's lives whether they have a passport or not. It really makes a big difference in people's lives if they need permission to move from one area to the next within the same country. It makes a big difference in people's lives if they can be jailed, put in jail without charge, without court. It really makes a big difference in people's lives if they go out to University, whether they'll be allowed to come back or not. - Whether we have an Israeli regime, or any other types of regime, for that matter, I will stay Palestinian. I didn't immigrate to this country, this country actually immigrated, or imposed itself on me. History didn't start on the 15th of May 1948, history has started a long time before that. So, if they want to define it as, you know, their Jewish state, for me, I don't even... I don't see that, and I will never be a part of that. I'm not Jewish, hence I'm not Israeli. I'm an Arab, I'm Palestinian, I was born here, so was my father, my greatfather, my great-great-grandfather, and this is Palestine for me. - You grew up in your daily life, and it's mixed with history that you study, or the places, the alleys that you walk, and go close to a mosque or a church. And then, each place, it's got its history. It's part of me, this history. - When you grow up in such a city, you learn a lot of things, and I learned a lot of things. A job is not taken for granted, education is not taken for granted, after-school activities is not taken for granted, books are not taken for granted, and I think I actually want my son to be here. I mean, I actually want him to grow up here. Nothing is taken for granted. - I don't remember when did it start. These feelings, I think it was born with me. It's like it's going through my blood, these alleys, these tones, and this sea, and the walls. - Because of this beautiful place, and a very painful place, we suffer from many things inside these walls. - It's not only stones, there is a human being here. - I hate stones. No, really, because, in some aspect, we sometimes give them more appreciation than life itself. If you take the walls of Jerusalem, there are more important than the people. Here, we don't have than feeling. - Sometimes, there are people that they say "I wouldn't go out of here unless I'm dead.", and I believe that. I mean, where else would you go? - I never, never figure that I could be better man if I leave Akka. I got the money, I got the status, I got everything I might desire, but the ultimate desire for me is to do our best, in order to achieve more in Akka, in this society, and to enhance it. - In the air, you see, you feel a lot of things, sometimes as if your heart wants to stop, especially when you do it the first time, but then the noise of the jump, the crash going down the water, and then the feel of the cold, of the nice water, and then going down, and then you need to open your eyes to see where are you, if there are rocks around you, and sometimes you see it's fantastic, it's a great thrill. - Palestinians make leaps of faith every day, because the political horizon is not there. They have to find a way to continue, they have no choice but to make leaps of faith every day. - You won't get your identity as a local Palestinian of Akka if you don't jump. - I decide when to jump. - You know, you can't just swim, you have to jump to be part of the gang. - If you don't jump, you are chicken. Would you like to be a chicken, man? - Okay, on my 30th birthday, I'm gonna jump over. - Let's be honest, I didn't jump, my brother pushed me. - After the first jump, I felt that suddenly, I am a man. - First time I had a meeting with my adrenaline. - I did it once when I was younger. - 11 or something. - Facing your fears. - Breaking the border. - Choosing my way. - When I look at these kids nowadays, I look at them still with admiration, and with a big smile. They all want to be heroes and part of it is to feel that you are connected with the rest of the heroes of town. In life, it's better to jump. - There is a fight over hummus, you know, worldwide. Who invented hummus, and who invented falafel, and who invented shawarma, and this just drives me crazy, like, you know, you don't even say hummus right. You don't even say hummus right, you didn't invent it. - When you meet an Arab person, you immediately think about hummus, and you ask "Do you like hummus?" - "Can you cook hummus?" It's our national dish, it's a national pride. - Hummus is commercialized in Europe, and in the States, that it's an Israeli traditional food. - A lot of Palestinians get upset when Israelis claim hummus is a national food. So, they're basically appropriating a cultural artifact, in this case a food item, and putting a national stamp on it, saying "This is Israeli." - This is Arab, nobody can convince me otherwise. I don't have any records, I don't have any preferences, but there's no other way. There is no story behind it, this was just there, just like falafel. - Well, if you have multinational corporations that are Israeli and can get hummus into all the major stores in the world, that Palestinians cannot do the same, then obviously they're going to lose this battle. - It's easy to manipulate, cause it's hummus. It doesn't fight back, it doesn't say "No, I'm an Arab." Personally, I don't like it. - She doesn't like it.
