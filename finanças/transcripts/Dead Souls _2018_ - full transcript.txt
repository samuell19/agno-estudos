What crime did they accuse you of? They said a few words, but they were spoken hastily. It was just chitchat. When they condemn you, they give you no explanations. They just say that you are a rightist element. And you remain one until you're rehabilitated. When they examine the remarks you've made, they claim you have made certain remarks! They blamed so much on me that I knew nothing about! When you got access to your file, what did it say? For the rehabilitation inquiry they asked me: "Were you re-educated?" "No." "Did you go to the study sessions at the police station?" "No." "Did you have a court ruling?" "No." So they explained to me that previously, the law stipulated that to charge someone with being a rightist, they needed at least the local government's approval. That's how it worked. In my case, nobody had approved anything. He asked me if I'd seen the approval. But there had been no approval. The decision had been taken by one of those teams of 5 people who fought against the rightists. They took the decision without consulting any superiors. It was the same story for everyone in Tianshui. That's how it happened. The harshest remarks I had made were about the China Democratic League. I said they were a bunch of incompetents who had done nothing when the new constitution was drawn up. I didn't say anything else of that nature. Were many rightists named at your school? No. In the very beginning, Wang Jianshan was the only one. At first, he was the only one in the whole establishment. Afterwards, they began to name two rightists every two days, with no reason and without approval. You were summoned and you left to work and be re-educated. Were you the only one from your school to be sent to Jiabiangou? There were 5 or 6 of us. I was the first one to return. From the school... there was also Gu Huimin, he was the last to return. He was the last one to come back from Jiabiangou. Also, Yang Shihua, who had escaped one year before. Did the others die there? Nearly all of them. Some cases you could just about understand, but Xiao Shuyi from the n°1 high school, we never understood his case. He had said absolutely nothing and yet, he was charged with being a rightist. "Dogs that look docile, are the most fierce." That was their reason for charging Xiao Shuyi. Is he still alive? He couldn't bare to be condemned a rightist, he preferred to commit suicide. The months that I was at Jiabiangou, the situation wasn't that bad. We were hungry, but things were still alright. However, once I had left that place, the situation got worse and people became more and more hungry. People began to eat cracked millet. But afterwards, they could no longer defecate. They had to be helped. To take it all out with a chopstick, even if the anus was totally damaged. Nobody had regular movements. That didn't happen to me, I had already left. When I left, I was transferred from Jiabiangou to Qingshui. I slept in Qingshui station before continuing the journey. The journey from Qingshui to Lanzhou. How did they know that you could fix cameras? They had put up an announcement in the camp. Then, they came and I did a test. I spoke of my experience and they wrote it all down. Three months later, I was transferred to Lanzhou. Compared to Jiabiangou, it was night and day! We had 24 kilos of grains per person, per month. And the work wasn't tiring. We even had time for ourselves. Whereas in Jiabiangou, the cereal ration was a few hundred grams per day. And the work was very hard. Life hangs by a thin thread! Those two worlds had nothing in common. Tell me a bit about life in Dashapin prison. I spent my days checking and repairing photographic cameras. The prison wanted to refurbish cameras. One day, a man arrived from Shanghai. Unfortunately our lenses were not polished correctly. We didn't have much success. The head of our Culture and Education section, Chen Bozhang, was also away on a trip. On the day we left, at the station, there was a big pile of books. I couldn't even manage to lift them. I said to him: "You should burn them all!" "We must re-educate ourselves and leave here new men! "I can't learn here, I'll be able to study better there." Before leaving Jiabiangou, I saw Chen Bozhong. It was four months since we had arrived. He'd taken his bedcover outside, into the sunshine. An unusual bedcover! Usually, the quilt is white, but his was gray. A gray trimming. I thought to myself: the trimming of his cover is gray. I went over to him. It wasn't his cover that was gray, it was just covered in lice! That made it look gray, but in fact, it was covered in lice. "Don't they make you scratch?" "I don't feel anything anymore." In my opinion, he had already lost his mind. Could you tell us about your younger brother? It was not long after I had left. I was already at Lanzhou when they sent him to Jiabiangou. He wrote to me when I was at Lanzhou. He explained to me that he'd arrived and wanted to be re-educated. Was he a rightist? - Was he a rightist? - Yes. Why had he been charged with being a rightist? He had been named a rightist. For what reason? Go ask the rightists why they were charged, not many of them know the answer. My brother worked at the Bureau of Culture and Education. - The Bureau of Tianshui? - Yes. In the district government. When did he die in Jiabiangou? I don't know. They sent a notice for his belongings to be collected. The notice said he was dead, without saying when he had died. Did they send you his personal belongings? They sent... a padded jacket. Who looked after his family? They looked after themselves. His wife left... As the situation here was impossible, she left with a guy from Shaanxi, from Xi'an. She took two of her children with her. She took two of them, and left one here. He still lives here, in Xiguan. He's okay, he's doing quite well. Of the two children she took to Xi'an, one of them died. She also died there, in Xi'an. I'm over 70 years old, now. Back then, I was only about 20. If I had been more unfortunate, I might be there now, long reduced to dust. I would like to know whether we were wrongdoers or not. We naively let ourselves be taken away. There, we were flawed people. Completely flawed. After rehabilitation, it was as if nothing had happened. In my file, there were only a few words scribbled down on a piece of paper. "Isn't that you?" "My crime, this piece of paper?" What took me there? Nothing. A rightist? I wasn't one. Anti-revolutionary? That wasn't my case. All those years of good and loyal services that I'd given the Party! Barely graduated, I became a volunteer for the Great North-West. I was rehabilitated over 30 years ago. I am well-educated with moral qualities. I'm even quite talented at teaching math. If it wasn't for my age, I'd still be teaching. What did I do wrong? I would like to be told! I would like to be shown. I said something at the time of the Anti-Rightist fight. They asked us to do a critique of the Party. If you said only good things you weren't credible. So I said it had some faults. I said: "The Party is sometimes a bit too distanced from the masses." I was done for. I was so naive. They kindly explained to me that I was being sent there for 6 months and that when I returned, I'd get my job and salary back. All that, with no administrative procedure. That was in October! The decision to send me there was taken in October 1958. The day before, I was still giving lessons. On October 1, I'd even been to dance, for the national holiday. You give the class, you go dancing and the next day, you leave to melt steel! My bags were ready when the studies director said to me: "Professor Zhao, wait a moment." "What is it?" He told me to come closer. "In the past, you were ready to join the laborers, and to work with the peasants. I'm going to give you that opportunity." I was happy! At the time, you had to "work with the laborers and peasants." Why deprive yourself of that? But when I wanted to join the others, they had all already left. I asked many times. I was naive. I was blinded by my ideals. Some people tried to tell me: "The school doesn't want you anymore! Find another job, elsewhere. What's the point of insisting?" "That's out of the question. I intend to remain a teacher." I put on airs, I was a teacher! I imagined myself back in my job six months later. As I didn't let up on the school, they asked an employee to accompany me. The public security changed my place of residence and got an employee from the school to accompany me. I was very happy during the journey. I was relocated and I didn't mind that. My family lost their right to grain tickets though my children were still very young. When I boarded the train, I burst into tears. I realized I was leaving my country and my family. On the way... My wife and three children accompanied me. I stumbled forward, with difficulty. I got down on my knees and I said: "For better or for worse, I am leaving. I'm no longer a resident here, I won't live off you. I'm leaving!" Jaw clenched, not turning back, I boarded the train. Suitcases in hand, I left. When I reached Lanzhou, getting off the train, a swarm of people wanted my suitcases! Why? They were there to recruit. One wanted an accountant, another an office worker, someone said to me: "Come and work in our factory! Come with us!" And I thought to myself I'll go nowhere, because in 6 months time, I'll be home. They took my suitcases and I ran after them. This farce lasted for more than one hour until we were able to continue our journey. We found some peace and quiet. Another train took us laboriously to Jiuquan. We stayed in Jiuquan for two days before an old vehicle took us to Jiabiangou. And then, when I entered the office, it was a real farce. They thought I was escorting the employee and wanted to keep him. They wished me a safe journey back. Do you see the irony of it? And the other guy protesting: "I'm escorting him!" "Who is escorting who, here?" It began with that comical moment. Once I got to those barren lands, I began to wonder. Li Jinghang was there. Ren Jiwen, too. As I hadn't eaten for 3 days, I began to eat my supplies. Ren Jiwen offered me his soup: "Zhao, you have to eat! You won't last for long like that. Look at the state of us!" They bemoaned and I began to regret. I had brought many things with me. A watch, a woolen coat, jumpers and long johns. A blanket and even my handsome fountain pen. Because I'd gone there to study! To toughen up through physical work. Except that I'd been fooled. I had even bravely announced that I had come to this farm for exercise. "You are here to be re-educated!" they said to me. That's when I understood my mistake. I came back on February 2nd 1961. I stayed there for 2 years and 3 months. Out of the 2,500 people, 2,200 of them died there. Over 300 people came from Tianshui but only around 20 of them came back. Of those of us who lived alongside the train tracks, there were 100 of us, I'm the only survivor. Throughout this period, the reality of the situation and the psychological pressure, were things we never told our families. We didn't dare write about it. The envelopes had to stay open. We could only say good things. Even if you'd lost all hope, you had to give some to your family. "Everything is fine. I'll be home in 6 months." They always thought that all was well for me. "I'm fine. I have all I need." We didn't dare say anything. After 6 months, I managed to go in secret to Gaotai. I went to someone's house and managed to write to my family. When they read my letter, they understood! I'd been conned. I'd deluded myself as much as I'd deluded my family. I arrived at the camp in 1960. At the end of 1961, people began to die. You went there in 1958, didn't you? Yes, in 1958! At the end of 1959, people began to die. The wheat we had planted had only produced two grains. The soil was highly alkaline. We were meant to dig ditches to drain the alkali. At 4 meters deep, there was still just as much of it! There was nothing to be done. At first, there were many of us. We went to work at the foundries in Jiuquan, we set the electricity poles. At the start of '59, we were still alright. We had some brown bread. But later on that year, we only had soup left. The farm had entered into a contract with the state and we declared ourselves self-sufficient. We committed to providing our own food and giving a quota to the state. When they heard this, the state had no more reason to help us. Towards the end of the year, wild vegetables, turnips and other vegetables, had become our daily food. That's when I finally woke up. I realized I'd been conned. What had I come here for? When we were at the steel mill, Yang Shihua, the head of high school n°3, who died last year... The blast furnaces, the electric poles, the excavation... He shouted from a platform: "Go on, go on!" We lifted up the stones. Some people lifted a basket of stones like that. But others lifted two, or three, even four! Why? Because you were given an extra bowl to eat. The men exhausted themselves. If we gritted our teeth, 2 of us could lift 2 baskets. At the 3rd one, I could no longer feel my legs. It was mostly the young men that died there. I didn't show off my strength, I didn't have any. That's how I survived. That is a simplistic way of telling a very long story. From early 1960, nothing grew anymore. We blamed it on the seeds. The management told us to plant sunflower. We ate the seeds and planted the shells! And the potatoes! In the afternoon we buried the sprouts in the evening, we dug them up to eat them. Nothing grew! The wheat only grew this high with at most two grains per ear. That's when people began to die. We moved to Gaotai-Mingshui where it was even worse. Gaotai... There were people from all over the country. There was nothing to eat and we swapped that nothing for... that! They didn't sell any! We learnt that our families were also in need. What they sent to us, they took from their own mouths! A few biscuits, some pancakes... and most often, they sent us a kilo of bread. But when we opened the packet, only a quarter of it was left. Someone had eaten it on the way. How could we complain to our families who were also in need. My wife was strict with the children. She told them: "Leave some for your father!" Just so I could have a bread roll that she dried to send to me. I remember my elder sister who stayed in Zhangjiakou, who saved me the eggs from her chickens. She cooked them and sent them to me. But when they arrived, they were rotten. When they sent us money, it was confiscated. They had to take care to hide it well in the package. We had a bit of money but nothing to buy! There was nothing to buy. You might have 30 yuans and not be able to buy anything. When people started to die, we placed them on an old plank with a mat. We carried them. Then, in the end, the men thought: "Today, I'm the carrier. Tomorrow, will I be carried?" So nobody took care of the dead anymore! Afterwards, we moved to Gaotai where we lived in caves! There, in the caves... life was reduced to warming ourselves in the sun, when there was any. We were filthy, and our hair was a sight! We looked anything but human. We had nothing to eat and people died for three reasons. The 1st reason was hunger. Then it was our morale and the 3rd, the psychological pressure. One day, you saw one of your companions die and you wondered whether it would be you next. The more you thought about it, the more terrified you were. In the cave, as soon as one person died, we put them outside. At the door to the cave. Then, another living person was let in. One stormy or snowy night was enough to bring more deaths. I don't know how many people I saw die! I helped take them out. Shortly afterwards, neighboring peasants came to strip their clothes from their bodies. To be frank, they looked like bled pigs with their bare skin. They were abandoned in the desert. That's the level of cruelty that we were exposed to. I can tell you a story. There was a woman from the North-East who must have worked in Xi'an. She arrived at the camp with her 3 children. That was before we came to Gaotai-Mingshui. When we realized why she had come, nobody dared talk to her. "I've come to see my husband, where is he?" she said. We all avoided answering her because he was dead. We told her to ask one of the managers. We didn't know the director but there was a manager by the name of Yan. A large chap. In the end, he said to her: "I have to tell you, you husband is dead." "Where is he buried? I couldn't see him alive, I must see his remains." How could we show her? Nobody knew where he was. The wolves might have eaten him or God knows who else... Now that she'd lost her husband, and as she was there with her packages, she decided to stay. "Look after my children, I'm going to stay here. I won't cost you anything", she said. She had bought many things and she began praying for her dead husband. She made offerings of incense and other things. She dressed in the rags of an old sheet and cried for her husband. Then, she said again: "I won't leave." Her 3 children were gathered around her, and she said to them: "Your father has died and your mother is not worthy of you. You will stay here. Your destiny will decide the rest." Then, she ran towards a pole, there were no trees! And she hung herself. Luckily, we were able to prevent the worst. After she'd been saved, she stayed for 3 more days. She had a train ticket but she wouldn't leave. We all tried to convince her. "Leave here quickly, this isn't a place for you. You have enough worries with your three kids. Look at us, a gang of devils! Black hands, black faces, hairy and ragged. What do we do in the sun, against the wall? We rid ourselves of lice!" It's impossible to get rid of those bugs! In my country, we say: "Debt is like lice, the more you have, the less it itches." 1 or 2 and it itches, any more and the itching stops. We had no small brush so we dusted them off with our hands. There's nothing to be done with lice. I wasn't spared. I had extra pairs of trousers but I didn't dare wear them. They would have undergone the same fate, immediately. So, I stayed as I was and dusted myself. I had one obsession: there was no way I was going to die here! They could all die, I would not! I gritted my teeth... I will not die here! That's all I could think about. I had trouble walking but I was still alright. Others couldn't manage anymore. I want to tell you one more thing. As we had nothing to eat, we'd buy salt crystals. It felt like we were eating when we sucked them. But the salt had far too much sodium and our legs swelled. Our arms were like matchsticks and our legs were huge. Impossible to crouch down and even harder to get up again. We had to defecate, even if we waited as long as we could. We had to get into this position. With our heads down, we could manage. It took us so long that we couldn't get up again. With our heads on the ground, we pulled up our trousers. But we had no more strength to do them up. That's why we walked with a limp, like prisoners, holding our trousers up. We went back and collapsed in the sleeping area covered in a little grass. Who knows what kind of grass! We returned to our straw mats, indifferent to everything. We were paralyzed. Lifeless mind, lifeless heart, and lifeless body. That same year, at the end of 1960, I escaped. I escaped twice. In July-August, I said to myself: if I have to die, may it at least be outside. To see my family once more. In any case, death is waiting for me. Some cunning people fled. If a train went past and it was a slow train, the bravest people climbed aboard and went to Xinjiang. Others waited for another train. I had no family in Xinjiang. The first time, I made it to Zhangye. That was one milestone reached. But there, I bumped into our manager who had come to Zhangye! How did he know that I had escaped? He went to find the militia who handcuffed me. Like a criminal. Back at the camp, my belongings had disappeared. It was still cold! Fortunately, I wasn't punished. They just removed the handcuffs. I had nothing left, only the daily bowl of gruel. Let me tell you, that very night, by the light of the moon, I prostrated myself on the dune more than once! I got down on my knees even if I'm not religious, and I implored Heaven. I hadn't done anything wrong. After my studies, I was a volunteer for the Great North-West. Even if I was young and pretentious, young and romantic, I'd done nothing wrong. Why should I die here? I fell to my knees and I prayed. I prostrated myself so many times that my forehead was sore. Each time, I begged not to die here. Let me see my family again. Why had my escape failed? It was the end of the year and more and more people were dying. I could still walk and I decided to leave. This time I'd succeed. I didn't dare go home. In the train, I pretended to be dead. I told the ticket inspector that I had no ticket, I'd run away. My fate was in his hands and he could throw me on the tracks, but if he had a heart, he'd leave me alone and understand that I was hungry. The passengers asked me if I was an escaped criminal. I'd done nothing illegal, I reflected the country, completely diminished. After 2 and a half days, I reached Pekin. My sister was there. She worked for the railways and lived behind Fuxingmen. When I got to my sister's house, she didn't recognize me. "What is going on?" "Nothing good." I spent three days sleeping and eating. I went to places where there were canteens. I waited until the meal was over, I looked for those who didn't finish and held out my bowl. "Don't you want anymore?" I held out my bowl. I spent two weeks like that. My sister fed me too but I couldn't eat much. A month and a half later, I could walk again. I bought my train ticket and I went home. The very next day, the local committee found out. For them, I was an escaped prisoner. They wanted to arrest me. I couldn't stay at my house. I begged them not to give my wife any trouble. And I left. I took some money, a few supplies, and I left before daybreak. Come in! Professor Pang, it's you! So I took the train to go back to the camp. I remember a guy from Xi'an who came to see a relative. His brother was at Mingshui. He had brought him some food from Xi'an. I was warming myself in the sun when he asked for him. I said to him: "Your brother..." At first, I tried to hide the truth from him. But in the end, I told him: "Your brother died. There's nothing to hope for." "Really?", he said. "Several thousand people have died here that I don't know. I knew your brother, I'm certain of that." "I want to see his tomb!" "That's impossible." "If you want to do something, pray to Heaven. "Your intention as the elder brother will be heard." He looked at me and I said: "Night is coming. We are a few kilometers from Gaotai, you can take the train there. However, you must cross the desert, and the ground is covered in brambles on these winding trails. I've done the journey several times, I will guide you. Don't worry about me, I don't mind taking the risk." He agreed. We got to Gaotai in the dark of night, at around 8 PM. He said to me: "I'm hungry. I have a few ration tickets left, I'll take you to a restaurant." Help yourself! I couldn't refuse. Please, make yourself at home! After the dinner, he questioned me on the station platform. I told him everything, from the school to my arrival at the camp. He said it was the same story for his brother. Then, I told him to board the train quickly. He understood my situation. "You have a good heart", he said to me. "My brother is dead and I won't leave with this food." He had some pancakes and roasted flour ready. He had one 2.5 kg bag of flour and more than 1 kilo of pancakes. He wanted to give it all to me. "What about you, what will you do if you're hungry?" "I won't eat on the way. I'll get to Xi'an quickly. For my family, life is not so hard. And we can buy things on the train." I said to him: "You're saving my life!" He gave me his address to go and visit him. I told him that if I got out of there, I would. We were emotional. He left me the pancakes and the roasted flour. "I've got some ration tickets left. Here are 5 kilos of grains in ration tickets." He gave them to me and I bowed before him 3 times. "You weren't able to save your brother, but you saved my skin." "Stand up quickly!" "Thanks to you, I am saved." He had indeed saved my life. I ate economically and made it last for two weeks. A small amount, day after day. Then, the order came! We all had to go back to our work units. The order was given. Everyone began to send telegrams and to write for people to come for us. Someone was authorized to go send our telegrams in Jiuquan or in Gaotai. A few days later, our families arrived. That didn't stop some people dying. You thought: "my family will be here tomorrow." And that was too much excitement. One icy night was enough for your family to find you dead. There were many cases like that. Some people, who walked to the station helped by their families, never made it. They died along the way. Death was just a blown out lamp. I was on a slow train. My son was still young. I looked like a regular offender with my ragged clothes. There were no seats so we camped in the toilets. A peasant must have forgotten his potatoes. There was a small bag of potatoes hanging up. Its owner must have forgotten it. I thought: it doesn't matter if people think I'm a thief, and I took 2 potatoes... Well, stole 2! They were this big. One for the kid, one for me. But I was seen, and somebody cried thief! The train manager heard and made us get off. It was a small station before Zhangye. He made us get off immediately and shut the door behind us. I realized I'd left my belongings on the train. What would we do without money? I took the kid and lifted him up. There were handles on each side. He held the one on the left, and me the one on the right. With my other arm, I held on to him tight. I said to him: "Hold on tight, it's not hot, but whatever happens, don't fall asleep! It will be windy, but the wind mustn't carry us off. Otherwise, they'll find us in pieces." We waited to get to a big station to go back inside the train. You... I don't know why. When we were encouraged to speak freely, I didn't say much. I didn't say anything in particular. I expressed myself about a suspect. I made a moderate criticism. A few unpretentious words. But then, they revealed things said in private. And that got me criticized. Then I was told I had to leave, although no meeting had ever declared me a rightist. The qualification of rightist had to be proclaimed in a meeting. "Let him take the rap!" Then, you knew where you stood. I had none of that. No such decision. The day I left, I was given a piece of paper. The school principal, An Hongsheng, and the Party Secretary, He Guoxiang, took me to one side to give me this paper. "The civil administration has removed you from your position and sends you for re-education. As you're going to Jiabiangou, do your change of residence." Your fate was settled in a few words. A piece of paper! I took this paper with me and gave it to an official in Jiabiangou. Han, the head of Propaganda & Education. I tried to ask questions, but challenging a verdict meant a double punishment. And my punishment was likely to be commuted to a prison sentence. I didn't protest. I didn't even dare ask why I was there. Later, when the rehabilitations occurred, I tried, in vain, to find out more. The former school principal and the others told me to drop it. So, I put up with it. At that time, I had already resumed my teaching. I came home in 1961. When I was released in January 1961, I spent 6 months in the hospital to get back on my feet. Then, I came back here, to Shijiazhuang. A month and a half later, the school sent me a telegram asking me to be there for the start of the year. That's when I went back to work. When I asked if I'd been rehabilitated, they asked me if I had been tried. I had to resume my classes as if nothing ever happened. It was in June 1958, the 6th day of the 5th month of the lunar calendar, that I arrived in Jiabiangou. As I was telling you earlier, I joined the construction team there. At first, it was OK. But I remember that as of October, some tough guys, like Zhao Zhenfang, went to extract gypsum or work in foundries. As it was physically beyond me, I was sent to Xintiandun. In Xintiandun, I was assigned to agricultural team no. 6. No, it was no. 7 or rather no. 5! I stayed there till the spring. In March or April, Propaganda & Education sent me to raise rabbits in Jiabiangou. This farm was called the "hutch"! And "Hutch" became my nickname. I think his name was Zhao. Yes, I think it was Zhao. This old man lived in Qinghai before being sent to Lanzhou. He was from Shanghai. We both looked after the rabbits until 1959 and even until 1960. Then, I was told that my rabbits died too fast. This Zhao... I forget everything! What was his first name? Don't try to find him. He died ages ago. He survived the camp. After I left the farm, I got sick and found myself in the infirmary. That was in October 1960 when everyone was going to Mingshui, the new farm. As they were checking our health, I went along with my luggage. My luggage was a few clothes and a blanket. I was examined and told: "You're not going!" And I got a lecture. "With your health? Fall out!" I didn't say anything. I waited to one side. They all went to Mingshui, and I stayed here. The head of the infirmary Chen Zaotang, kept me. His name is written "Tang", the "Tang" character. His hand is trembling. You see? Chen Zaotang drew me aside. The others left. "Gu Huimin! Go to infirmary no. 3." I thought I'd get treated. In fact, I stayed till the end. I came home from there. So, despite the years spent in Jiabiangou, I don't know much. We knew nothing about one another. For example, what criticism had LAN Jingrong made? We didn't know. Zhao Zhenfang and I were like brothers. We could have talked about the reason for our detention. Any exchange of information was strictly forbidden. We couldn't talk about our own cases. Strictly forbidden! We risked public criticism. When the first prisoners arrived in the camp, we took into account their physical condition. The assignments were still relevant. But when 2,000 men arrived at once, they didn't pick and choose. Everyone found themselves digging desalination trenches. People from Tianshui generally did those jobs. They were better fed and were even given a few coins. Whereas we were once given 1 yuan, that's all. Our hair and beards were this long. We had no money to get our hair cut. In winter, we had frostbite on our feet. How it hurt. I was going to see Li Jinghang. He'd been at the camp for ages and worked in the carpentry shop, because he knew a bit about it. I could warm myself up with a foot bath. In his book "This Time Spent in God's Grace", he says he feeds me. Did you read his book? He says he feeds Gu Huimin. I often went to warm up there. We were in the same teaching group in High School no. 1. We taught mathematics and industrial design. I taught industrial design. In Jiabiangou, he became a carpenter. I never asked any questions. I never said: "What are you doing here?" And he knew nothing about me. Who dared speak? The team leaders were intractable. They sent you to mow a plot of 13 ares. You were supposed to mow it and bring it all back. Woe betide anyone who left any behind! You also plowed 13 ares. In winter, on the 12th moon, without warm underwear, I worked till late. Fortunately, I had a very kind team leader. "Gu Huimin, are you done?" "Almost." "When you've finished, come see me." He'd kept me some food. Others would have said: "You have the nerve to ask? Eat your shit!" And you'd go hungry. The team leaders? Some were fair. You had to deal with all these people. The teams were made up of 40 or 50 men. Each team had its leader surrounded by some helpers. There were good team leaders, but most of them were ruthless. They weren't all bad. I met some very good ones. But although I met some good ones, I also saw many scenes... I always went to get my food later than the others, because I'd noticed that you got more. And once, in the kitchens, I saw a man tied up. It's true that in the teams, the men didn't always work very hard, but some leaders were too strict. If you read "Bitter Sun", you'll see how Wang Jin treated his men. Wang Jin and I had been colleagues for 4 years. It was under Ren Jiwen's leadership. The account talks about a certain Zhang. A team leader named Zhang. I'd never met him. Mind you, I was in Jiabiangou whereas he was in Xintiandun. Men were treated hard in Xintiandun. As an annex, his management was different. But the most deaths were in Mingshui. Initially, there were 2,700 of us. I know this because I was Han's "pencil pusher". There must have been 2,500 or 2,700 of us, my memory fails me. When I came back to Tianshui, there was almost no-one left. One day, Ma Yaozu asked: "Seen Han? He came to find me, but I sent him back to you. "I asked him how many had survived. "He said "just over 500." Take, say, team no. 6 in Xintiandun. The team leader was very hard. Really hard! I wasn't under him, but I saw him at work. He was dreadful. I witnessed his behavior. I don't know if others mentioned him, but I saw it with my own eyes. There was a teacher from Wuwei. I happened to know him. Like me, he'd taught at Zhangye Normal School. At the time, Zhangye was my first assignment. So we had been colleagues. He graduated from Beijing Normal University. He came from Northwest Normal University and had spent 2 years in Beijing, after the victory over Japan. After graduation, he was sent to Zhangye Normal School, then to Wuwei before being called a rightist. I saw him again at Xintiandun camp. His face was swollen like this, so were his legs. "What's wrong, old Xie?" His name was Xie Jianhong. "What put you in this state?" "I'm sick." "You must ask for time off." "It's not allowed." I asked around and found out that his leader called him lazy and said he was unwilling to work. Actually, he was sick. You just had to see his face. One day, at the first moon, we had to manure the fields. So, we had to carry baskets full of manure. As he was too weak, he was told to fill the baskets. Fill the baskets for others to carry. It was full of stones, so it was very heavy. Someone strong could fill a basket in 2 spadefuls. He wasn't strong enough and couldn't keep up. In the end, he gave up and took to his heels. He went to hide in the dormitory. The wind was very strong, much stronger than here. We could hardly stand. I said to myself: "Let's go see Xie Jianhong." "Why are you here?" "I hear you got a parcel." "Here, I got some cigarettes." "No, thanks, you keep them." He was lying on his straw mattress. Like this, on the floor. I went over and asked: "What's the matter with you?" I took the cigarettes from his pocket and lit one for him and one for me. He'd hardly had any when his team leader came. "Xie Jianhong! What are you doing here? Get to work!" He grabbed him. "Chief, he's sick!" "I don't care!" And he stood him up. I insisted: "He's sick, I'll go instead." "You shouldn't be here. Go back to your team!" I was in team no. 5. I don't know what team he was in. At noon, I went to get news and came across my team leader. "Gu Huimin, go cover the manure." If we didn't cover it, it would blow away. I got down to it till noon, then went to get news. Xie Jianhong was on the floor. Duan, the doctor, was there. Duan was also a camp rightist. "Dr. Duan?" He was dead. Today it's hard to say what his sickness was, but for me, if he hadn't been abused, he'd still be alive. That's one abuse I witnessed. I saw many people tied up. I quickly changed direction. What good would getting involved do? That's pretty much all I know. Me and my rabbits lived a quiet, uneventful life. We are believers. Do you know Li Jinghang? He's a believer, too. We're the same. I got through it and don't deal with all that anymore. It's better to let the Lord handle it! During the years I spent there, of course I suffered. We had severe frostbite. Our fingers were all white. The lesions bled, and bandages didn't help. I tried applying an ointment I got in Lanzhou. For a yuan, you got some. I spent a yuan on some ointment, but the pain was still unbearable. Li Jinghang said: "Be brave, I'll fix it for you." He took a double thread and sewed me up. Then he held my hand over the fire. It sizzled. After that, it was good! I was healed. Over there, if you started crying, you could cry for ages! When things were bad, people died every day. In my dormitory, there were 14 of us, Up to 3 died a day. It was OK until it snowed. But when there were snowstorms in winter and when seasons changed, up to 5 people died a day. Chen Zaotang, the chief, had asked me to be team leader. I slept near the door and did the roll call. That's all I could do. We were given some oil each week, and I'd light the lamp. After dark, I'd do the roll call. So-and-so, so-and-so... So-and-so doesn't answer. "What's going on?" Someone said: "He's not talking." "Make a report!" "So-and-so is dead." I felt I was there, just waiting for the next one. The authorities told us to make mutton soup. Actually, we served them broth with a few chives, soy sauce and vinegar. "Do you want some more?" "I want some..." And I handed the cup to the sick person. Generally, he'd lie down. Soon after, they'd call me: "He's not breathing." One more. Death was never far away. For that reason, I thank 2 people. Chen Zaotang and Wang Yanshan. It's written... During those 2 and a half years, Chen Zaotang was always there for me. He saved my life 3 times. The first 2 times, with a shot for the heart. The last time, with a homemade candy. He slipped a sugar beet candy into my mouth. "Gu Huimin! Gu Huimin!" "Yes, who's calling?" Chen Zaotang shouted: "He's coming around!" 3 times I almost died. People didn't go in excruciating suffering. They slowly passed away. Who was I talking about again? I wanted to talk about Wang Yanshan. There's plenty to tell. He knows a lot about Jiabiangou. Wang Yanshan was head of the secondary system. I knew him in 1950 in Lanzhou. We took part in the Revolution. When I was transferred from Zhangye to Tianshui, he was section chief. He was in charge of secondary schools. Zhang Junyi was secretary general. Wang and Zhang were 2 directors I was very close to. Wang Yanshan was there, like me, for being a rightist. He came from Yuzhong and graduated from Lanzhou University. As he had a good constitution, they made him a gravedigger. At the end, there was no-one to bury the dead. We had no strength! They took the strongest and fed them well. A good ration, with extra bread. Not at every meal, but morning and evening. Or evening and lunch. Wang Yanshan went without bread. He put it to one side and when it was dark, he came to the infirmary. "Gu, take this. "Ssh! Hide!" I ate it under the covers. I had my bread roll for 20 days. The last 20 years. It kept me going. When they let us go, everyone left but me. "Aren't you going?" "No-one from home can come here. Who'll help me?" No authorization had been issued. Chen said, "Get up and go! "This is your only chance! Look at that mop of hair! Shave it." He shaved my head and beard. "Get dressed!" "I have nothing to wear anymore." "Get some from the shed." The clothes of the dead, provided by the government, were stored there. The truck left Jiabiangou at 10 AM and reached Jiuquan at nighttime. People died on the way. In the back, the men were lying down like in the hospital. They gave you some food to keep you alive. Several died on the way. Once we were on the train, it got better. But at the station, I passed out in the crowd. When I finally came around, no more shoes! Barefoot in the middle of winter, I was in trouble. I shouted: "Who's got shoes?" I had a leather shoe and a canvas one. That's how I got to Lanzhou. They put us up at Xinlan Hotel. Many families from Tianshui were decimated. I was alive, but my family was ruined. We had 5 children. They were all small. How could we cope? - The youngest was this big. - I left with 3 yuans in my pocket. In Tianshui, our salaries were taxed. Out of my salary of 79.50 yuans, they only paid me 70 yuans. And during that time, I actually only got 35 yuans. How could my family survive? My wife wanted me to take more money. I took 3 yuans. 3 yuans for 3 years. As if I could afford to worry about my appearance! She'd made me shoes, and I sold them to get a haircut. We thought we'd be home soon. Who could have imagined such a hellhole? Without the rescue decision and without all those dead, we wouldn't be alive. We weren't supposed to come home. We were supposed to be employed to build a city for re-education through labor. As the head of the camp said: "A city with great buildings and factories where we'll work together and bring our families!" So, we didn't know what to do with all our dead. And he talks about sandstorms... He never saw any! Whereas I saw lots. Several a year. When the wind of yellow sand came, it could bury you. There were storms which made the sky go black. Black sand which fell as rain. Once, we lost 2 men. 2 who didn't come back from Beishawo. I sheltered in my rabbit hutch, safe and sound. As a believer, I thank the Lord for letting me live. On this point, I'm with Li Jinghang, right? The anti-rightist movement was in 1957. In 1956, police would come every week and stand outside our church. It wasn't a good sign. During the winter, shortly before New Year, a pastor from our community, Ma Hezhen, said to me: "Professor Li, we must gather and pray so that the holiday season is a peaceful event." I went to find the faithful, but no-one dared to show their faith. Out of 100 members, no-one wanted to take the risk. There was just me praying every morning at 4 AM, with the pastor for 3 days. At that time, we could avoid police surveillance. The 1st day went off without a hitch. It was a long trip between Dongguan and Dacheng Avenue. It took me a half hour on foot. I'd get up at 4 and go and pray. So, we finished by 6 at dawn. The 1st day, it went well. The 2nd day, the pastor said to me: "Professor Li, in the next few days, we should sleep with our doors and windows open." I asked him why. He said: "Satan is acting up." "Father, are you afraid? "Why? God protects us!" In my book, I describe how, on the 3rd day, I was afraid going to church. When I got there, I had only just kneeled down when the little door next to me started squeaking. I imagined a boy was listening at the door and reporting back to the authorities. I got up and rushed over to the door to grab the boy. I opened one of the double doors. I tried to grab the boy... He'd run away. I couldn't find him! I looked all around the courtyard. There was no-one in the bushes. What had made the noise? The wind? The bamboo wasn't moving. The leaves in the trees were still. Clearly, it was the devil. I went back inside and started praying again. As I was praying, I turned to check everything was OK in the yard. As I looked out of the window, I saw light burst from one of the trees in the yard. An explosion of light. I thought it must be Father Wei's flashlight. But it would have been a beam, not an explosion. It was an explosion of red light. As I was still wondering about it... I was kneeling in the aisle, a long space. In front of me, everything flared up. A beam of light came from the ceiling. Our ceilings used to be covered with paper, not like now. The light came down and spread over us. It covered everything. This electric light was like lightning flashes in June, but this big in diameter. A light without the slightest dust. A light without the slightest impurity. I was flattened to the floor and I hid my head under the pew. Facing the floor, I begged as I did in Jiabiangou: "Glory to You, Lord! "O Risen One, be my savior!" I begged as much as I could. Then, I went over... While I was begging, Father Ma cried out: "Professor Li, come!" Although I was well into my 30s, I crawled over to him. Then, I heard old Liu in the yard. "Professor Li, is everything alright?" I opened the window. He thought I'd had an unpleasant encounter. I called out: "Dear Liu, don't worry, I'm fine!" After that, I couldn't pray. Father Ma asked me: "Professor Li, what did you cry out earlier?" "I saw a light, a big beam which hit the floor. This big, like a flash of lightning." Inside, everything was lit up! Like when light spreads in open country after lightning. Do you see? It was as bright as that. Everything lit up before I was thrown to the floor. He said he hadn't seen any light on my head. I didn't dare reply that he was in front of me, so he couldn't see any light on my head. I kept quiet. What's the point? I couldn't understand what had happened. Why a red light and a white one? The pastor had no explanation, nor did I or anybody. It was incomprehensible. One thing was certain: it wasn't lightning or the building would have collapsed, and we'd have been struck down by lightning. It wasn't the case. It was indeed a divine manifestation. Was it God? I don't know. I only understood when I went back to Jiabiangou. I finally understood. It took me those 4 years to understand. Red was the devil's light. The devil was restless, he was acting up. White was the light of the Lord. Of course. He was saying: "My son, next year will be terrible for you. You'll be sent to a camp. You'll need courage. Trust yourself. I'll be by your side." I finally got it! Society then rejected people like me. In such a context, I was persona non grata. Persona non grata. I was likely to get into trouble. Not being on the same side, I became an opponent to be excluded. From a moral standpoint, I was blameless. I was a conscientious teacher. I behaved like an honest man. I submitted to the organization of the Party while worshipping God, which I considered beneficial to the nation. Was there a lot of pressure? Yes, there was. I taught high school for a junior high salary. I was the target of many campaigns from 1950 until 1978. I faced many attempts to remodel me. I got constant ideological re-education. But my faith in God remained steadfast. Through re-education, I learned to serve the Party with all my heart and apply myself to my work, without blaming anyone. But the more I re-educated myself, the stronger my faith became. After a month's hard labor in Xintiandun, I had already lost my health. Every night, I had seminal losses. Nocturnal emissions, see? Every night, I'd wake up, my belly covered in semen. For a man to do that, he must be in poor health. Mustn't he? Where I come from, it's called "losing self-control"! When it happens to you every night, you think the end is near, right? I don't mean occasional accidents. Every day, I woke up, my belly covered in semen. I'd stagger around, my soul in turmoil. I thought my end was near. "Lord, are You calling me? Tomorrow, I'll lie down on the site. People will walk over me. They'll ask if I'm playing a run-over dog. The cadres can criticize and fight me. I'll let myself be trampled on. Lord, tomorrow I'll give myself to You." I was crying. "Lord, tomorrow... Do what You think is right, I'm in Your hands." The next morning, the team leader brought us some fried pancakes for breakfast. As he left, he suddenly started screaming: "Li Jinghang! Go to the carpentry shop." Heaven granted me grace. At the carpentry shop, we could eat better and sleep better. We weren't in the sun. I felt alive again! Once there, I pulled out a Bible. Kneeling on the bed, I started praying. God the Father had me given a Bible. I opened it at random and I read: Be in peace and obedience. I don't recall the exact words. Where were the dead of Xintiandun buried? I don't know exactly. I was in the carpentry shop. Somewhere in the dunes. At first, I made caskets to bury them in. Then, we just buried the dead in their blankets. There's a story I tell in my book. My wife had come to see me. I was on my bed. I was humming hymns. "Li Jinghang! You're singing religious songs!" A young man approached my bed. There was a little stove. It wasn't lit, but he pretended it was. "Where are you from?" "I'm from Nankin. I studied history in Nankin. I'm 27. I never would have imagined human beings could come to this." Just then, a cadre came in. "Get back to bed!" And he went back to his place. In the evening... we heard: "Nobody move!" I looked up and I saw him, completely naked. They took his body away, carrying it over me. The next morning, my wife told me they'd taken 5 away. 5 bodies piled up, tied up in their blankets. On each of them, they'd put a piece of wood this big. On his, a Christian name had been written! So he was a brother! I've forgotten his name. He was from Nanking. We had to prepare spring sowing. Zhang Zhongliang, the Gansu secretary, had made it a real battle. But there was nothing there! We should have brought supplies. I was in charge of the luggage. "Li, what took you so long?! We've been in close formation for days!" "Close formation" meant that we kept close to stay warm. No more than that. We've been waiting for you for days, all huddled up. You could also hear it like a play on words. "Li, now you bring our things! I've had time to become squad leader!" Actually, the men slept huddled up outdoors. Do you understand? The troops had been sent before the supplies. The men had nothing to eat, and at night, they were freezing to death. There weren't any shelters. Once we got there, we started to dig them. It was really hard! Do you know which camp in Mingshui you lived in? I don't know. I arrived at night after a day's traveling. There was a village, but I mainly remember the site. We boarded the train in Jiuquan and reached the camp at 11 PM. One other thing I've never talked about. When I was there, I was moved to another dormitory. A man was sleeping just there, at my feet. There was a blanket on him. He was groaning, but no-one gave him any food. He didn't have his own place, so no-one took care of him. 3 days later, he died. Right there at my feet. Isn't that terrible? Why didn't he have a bed? I was already at the end. There was no more room. He wasn't supposed to be there, so he wasn't fed. Maybe he'd been forgotten at the roll call. His name wasn't on the lists. Food was in short supply, so he got nothing. He groaned for 3 days before dying under his blanket. What cruelty! Today, I still think about it. Why didn't he have a bed? At my feet, it wasn't a bed, but he'd been left there as if there was no other solution. So, since he wasn't on the list, he wasn't entitled to rations. The cadres didn't check, and the kitchens didn't care. He groaned for 3 days before he died. His name was... I forgot his name. He wasn't married. He'd turned 40, so people made fun of him. They called him the "old virgin", because he wasn't married. He was a cadre. One evening, I came out of my hole and I prayed to God. "Lord! In the days of the Old Testament, there were miracles. I want a miracle today! I demand one of God." I got out of my hole, scrabbled up the dune, and stood at the top. "Lord! In Old Testament times, You did miracles. Today, I need a sign of Your divine action!" Let's say a rabbit comes to me, and I catch it. There was nothing other than rabbits around there. Then, I thought: The rabbit may take 5 minutes to reach me. But if it takes a half hour, I won't last. The wind is much too strong. The coat I'm wearing is far too light. I won't last. "Lord, what if 3 rabbits flew up to me!" Then, I saw 3 birds above me and I raised my hand. 3 birds came to land in front of me. I looked at them. There were 3 of them. Not one less. In my book, I explain their behavior. Coordinated movements. I couldn't believe my eyes. In summer, there are no birds here. Where did they come from in winter? They were real, but I didn't feel I could catch them. They seemed more and more real to me. It all lit up! So I left them and went home. Not many people could understand. It was obvious to me: "Lord, I have sinned." Why? Because if a rabbit had really come, I had nothing to skin it with. If I'd opened it with a stone, I had nothing to cook it with. And anyway, I would have died immediately as my organism was weak with hunger. My approach wasn't serious and I went home, leaving the birds. Who can believe my story? No-one. I can't force anyone to believe me. That's how it was! People may not believe me, but I'm here in the flesh! To the youngest in the family, I tell the facts as they are. That is the 1st story. The 2nd... The 2nd... After my wife left... Usually, I had peaceful nights. "Lord, I sleep before Your throne of grace." I always prayed, but that night, I couldn't. I couldn't sleep and I heard a voice, but I couldn't tell where it came from. It said: "You must not break the 3 arrows." Arrows. "You must not break the 3 arrows." I had to sleep... "Don't break the 3 arrows." A tiny whispering voice. Where did it come from? I don't know. One thing was certain, she was talking to my inner self. 3 arrows... 8, 9 PM, 10, 11 PM, etc. The whole night! A very clear voice and me in the fog. A whole night in total confusion. And that voice still present. What were those 3 arrows that couldn't be broken? It was better to get up and get some fresh air. I got dressed. I'd barely put a foot on the ground... Let's say that was my bed. I felt dizzy. I went back to bed and started raving. "Take my body away! Take my body away!" A cadre was there and yelled at me: "What are you talking about?" Then, he left. At the foot of my bed, I had a metal cup. A man came and took it away. I yelled: "Leave it! It's too soon to fleece me!" And he put the cup down. Then I got delirious again. Everything became clear. No doubt about it, Satan was trying to take my life. Satan declared war on me. I started praying, begging the Lord. "Glory be to you, Lord! O Risen One, be my savior!" I begged for all I could. A voice said to me: "Hell is terrible! "Satan, that hell you talk about belongs to you! I'm in Heaven, away from you." Of course, I didn't see Satan. I implored again and again... "Glory to you, Lord!" After long curses, I was coming around and I started reciting the Bible. No, not yet! A voice told me: "Get up! Get rid of the oil that your wife brought you. Pour it in! It won't save you. Do the same with the flour. Come on, get up!" "Satan! The oil is my father's blood. My family went without for this flour when it was in need." I didn't listen. I was regaining my self-confidence and I started reading the Bible. A sermon said: "Take the helmet of salvation, Have truth as your belt, the sword of victory in your hand. In the name of Christ, I say: Back, Satan!" After that, I don't know. Then, in the evening: "Li Jinghang, get up and eat!" To eat, we had a bowl of groats. No bigger than this. I was about to eat when a voice said in my ear: "If you eat, you will lose your life." A clear voice whispered in my ear. "Satan! Life is not just about food." And I hurriedly swallowed my gruel. I've never had a night as peaceful as that one. I remember the last shelter I was in. A big troglodyte dormitory where there were just 2 of us. Me and someone else. I was leaning like this against the door when I saw a bus coming. A bus for at least 20 people with only 1 passenger. He got out and said to me, tapping my shoulder: "Comrade, in a couple of days, you'll have rice and flour." What did that mean? On that note, the official left and came back 3 hours later. He gave us a shot. His attitude was very different. We were perplexed. The rescue plan had started! But there were only 2 of us left! 2 people in this big space. How many survivors were there in your ravine? At the end? It's hard to say. I don't know. How many people did the bus take? What bus? First they took us to Gaotai. I mean from Mingshui. The day we left Mingshui, there were only 2 of us. Pu Yiye and me. - By tractor? - No, by bus. A large vehicle which took us to the station. I heard that the city of Tianshui had sent 238 people and that only 21 people came home alive. Not even a 10th, because that would've made 33 people, 23 people! Only 21 survived. Not even the percentage that's usually mentioned. The case of Tianshui wasn't the worst. In the district of Xianhe, of the 6 intellectuals who left, not one came home. 100%! Of the 5 teachers from Tianshui Normal School and the 6 teachers from High School no. 1, of those 11, I'm the only one who came back. Only 1 came back. Without God's grace, we wouldn't have seen anyone. From Tianshui Normal School, none came home. How many districts didn't see anyone come back? 100% deaths! Who made it out? The cooks, the gravediggers, kitchen helpers, the horse keepers. They came back. And those who escaped. Apart from them, almost no one survived. Or a very low percentage, maybe 1 or 2%. My treasure. You'll see, there are dates listed. Here, we can read: December 4, 1960. December 4, 1960. December 4, 1960. That night, I asked: "Lord, why is it so hard?" Here's his answer. It's brilliant! He was talking to me! That's old stuff. December 1960... There, I was in the carpentry team. 194... July 15, 1958, it was at the workshop. The 1st time at the workshop. There are lots of dates! All the dates when the Lord spoke to me. I think those from Tianshui, like me, formed the 2nd group. We were the 2nd group to be sent there. - Why were you sent there - I was a rightist. A pure rightist, without any "historical" mention or anything else. Just rightist. How were you designated a rightist? I had criticized an officer of my unit. He was posing as a veteran, a former 8th Army soldier, which he wasn't. He was a rough character, without any education. In my work unit, there was only 1 deputy position. He'd spend his days with his kid, wandering the streets. He led a very dissolute life! That's why I criticized him. We had a great director who was very serious. He was a Party secretary. As I had criticized the morals and working methods of one of our leaders, they said I was attacking the Party. Going after an individual meant going after the Party. At first, I wasn't targeted. But directives came from on high, and the 2% rightist quota has risen to 12%. The objective had to be met. In my unit, I was very hard-working. I was in insurance, not in the bank yet. I was head of the department. An insurance company? After Xi'an where I studied, I was sent to Tianshui. I said he had bad morals, and should correct himself and work a bit harder. He took it out on everyone, saying the Revolution had caused the loss of his family and that he wasn't paid accordingly. He wanted compensation! The Revolution caused his loss. I wasn't the only one to criticize him in the company, but I was the only one to express myself openly. They made me pay for it. - With sessions of criticism? - Of course! Of course! You couldn't avoid them. Public accusation sessions conducted by "activists". I was sitting at my desk. They dragged me to the middle of the room. As I did that, they said I'd hit them. I resisted! Several of them dragged me, so I resisted. They said I'd hit them and added another charge: "Negative attitude, violent and arrogant behavior." The Disciplinary Board wasn't in favor of my conviction. But Feng, the leader I had criticized, lobbied the Council so I'd be accused of being rightist. There! Once there, things were OK at first. After a while, 2 or 3 months, we ran out of grain. The town of Jiuquan no longer supplied us with food. Our farm had to be self-sufficient. At that time, the Secretary of Gansu, Zhang Zhongliang, had stated that farms had to be self-sufficient. It was OK for labor reform farms, but we were one of those labor re-education farms which had replaced them, and the previous employees had gone. There were over 2,000 of us. Almost 3,000. The place was called Jiabiangou. We were sent by our work units. Like High School no. 3, Tianshui Normal School, the market gardening cooperative, the insurance company, and Public Safety. We were sent by our work units. 2 people escorted us. 1 in army uniform, with his rifle. The other in plain clothes, a friend from the radio. They're both still alive. Historical counter-revolutionaries were all handcuffed. As ordinary rightists, we were authorized to make certain purchases. First came the breakdown into teams. Then we'd go to the construction site. We dug very deep trenches. The size of a man and more. The height of this room. They were wide too. We dug to drain the ammonia. A task reserved for the construction team. The Dean of Lanzhou University, Chen Shiwei, wrote down the tasks to carry out. The Dean of Lanzhou University, Chen Shiwei. He was exempted from heavy tasks and he recorded our work hours. We had to dig. There was the construction, agricultural, and ancillary work teams. 3 teams. We were the construction team. Can you explain to me how you dug the trenches? At first, the work was moving slowly. Then, I had the idea of using a lever system. Then, I went a lot faster. The same system as the one used to draw water in the south. You lower your bucket like this and you lever it back up. That way, you force less. With this lever system, we went faster. We dug till we reached the water. We had our feet in the water and our legs were rotting. Ammonia has a very corrosive effect in the trenches. I worked in the trenches for a long time. Over 2 months. Then, they sent me to the gypsum quarry. We lost someone from Tianshui in the quarry. There hadn't been a death then. A block crushed him. The head of an elementary school in Tianshui. School no. 1, Construction Street. His name was Zhang Xiu. Crushed to death. The 1st death not due to hunger. An accidental death. He crushed by a block of gypsum. We had to extract a certain amount of gypsum every day. A cubic meter, say. If you tried to come down too soon, you'd get no food. The men were exhausted. How many never had worked with their hands? You had to work fast, because the plaster was exported. It was the camp's subsidiary production. The plaster was excellent quality. Later, they sent me to the Qilian Mountains to extract iron ore. After a while at the mine, I worked at Jiuquan, on the construction site of... Qingshuipu. They were building a road to the satellite launch base. We extracted stone and sand and loaded the trucks. We'd stand either side and load them with shovels. It was over a period of time. After that, they put me in Beidahe, near Jiayuguan. There was a stone quarry. We slept in tents. Then, I got sick and I was sent back to Jiabiangou. I couldn't do it anymore. I had a big problem with my lungs. They sent me back to the central station. Over there, they put me on auxiliary activities. Towards the end, my face and legs were all swollen. We had no food. The government didn't provide us with supplies. We used to eat grasses like those in the rice paddies. Only then, we didn't have bowel movements. We had to clean each other out till our anuses bled, because of what we ate! We ate the leaves of date trees. It's a region of date palms, and we ate the leaves. After I got sick, I never left the station again. I stayed at the central station, but there was also an annex, Xintiandun annex. And also Mingshui camp, in Gaotai. They sent the strongest there. Many died there. - Did you ever go to Mingshui? - To Mingshui, never. The first time my wife came to see me, it was very cold. I had a string around my waist. I had no buttons and I closed my jacket with a string. A rotten old hat on my head. My wife burst into tears when she saw me. What had they done to me? My face was... lined. Emaciated and lined. The 2nd time she came, my face and legs were all swollen. Edemas caused by malnutrition. Not one of us avoided it. Not one. Not one. At the end, the dormitories were sparsely populated. This person died, then, that one. The man next to me was called Wang Rui. He was from Tianshui High School no. 1. He died next to me. He said: "Zhao, I'm hungry! Get me some groats." I brought him his groats, but he was dead. Wang Rui. His wife is in the pedestrian street, the former eastern part of Zhonghua. She's over there. He's dead. An excellent teacher. from High School no. 1. He was a talented mathematics teacher. He's dead. I was asked to bury him, but I didn't have the strength. We buried them in the ravines of Jiabiangou. We just dug a little. At first, the caskets were made of thin boards, then the wood ran out. So, we used straw. But it took time, so we ended up wrapping the dead in their blankets and tying them with string. When night fell, we'd put them on an ox cart. Sometimes, 5 or 6 would go together. And we buried them. I saw it with my own eyes. I tell it like it is. The cart was pulled by an ox, not a horse. When was this? It was at the start of 1960. There were so many deaths. Fu Zuogong, Fu Zuoyi's brother, was in my team. Fu Zuoyi. You know who I mean? A celebrity! His brother had studied in the USA. He helped develop the province's water. An engineer. Another who was sent to die there. No? The principal of Northwest Normal School, Li Huafang, died there. The principal of Northwest Normal School died there. The women went crazy! There were some with us. About 20 of them. My wife is no longer with us. She passed on 8 years ago. Without my wife, I certainly wouldn't be here. She was exemplary with me. A lot of wives got divorced. Not mine. Most got divorced and remarried. Not mine. She was wonderful to me. My wife sent me a parcel every month. At the time, the Post Office prohibited parcels parcels of grain. The most you could do was send a kilo of roasted flour. Families would send us roasted flour. As it was forbidden in town, they sent it from the country... from country post offices. A cousin who was in Tibet brought me butter. Yak butter that he brought me from Tibet. This cousin was a driver for the army in the region. He could afford it and supplied me on the way. We were too poor. My family couldn't help me. They even expected me to help them. Times were hard. We were destitute. Yet Hanzhong, where we lived, was a prosperous region. It wasn't enough. and famine decimated the region. So many people died of hunger in Gansu. People fled to Shaanxi. In Shaanxi, the Party Secretary was Zhang Desheng. In Gansu, it was Zhang Zhongliang. Zhang Zhongliang said: "In Gansu, there's lots of grain." Zhang Desheng retorted: "Why do so many people flee your province then?" Everyone who lived along the railroad tracks was leaving. Qingshui, my wife's country, Zhangchuan, Qin'an, Tongwei, Gangu, Wushan, Longxi. In this area, there were a lot of death. They all starved to death. You saw people walking along the street and suddenly collapse, stone dead. The last time my wife came, I didn't move from my bed. She burst into tears. The situation was so terrible. We didn't move from our beds. The dormitories were deserted. Just empty beds! We used to be all huddled up. There were just a few scattered individuals. My wife slept with me in the same dormitory. The 2nd time, she came without my son. On the train, she got scammed. "Ma'am, lend me your ticket, I'll get you some water." She never saw her ticket again. When she got off the train, my wife told the inspector: "A woman stole my ticket. pretending to get me some water." My wife convinced the inspector. Once in Jiuquan, she had a cup stolen. When she saw me half dead, she burst into tears. She went to beg Secretary Liang and Director Liu. She had a letter from the Disciplinary Committee. They took their time to make their minds up. She stayed a long time, more than the first time. At least 5 days. They were studying my case and discussing it. We waited. In the last months, no-one worked. The men stayed lying down. There was nothing to eat. You were given a ladle of gruel per meal. A ladle of food wasn't enough. The porridge was made with coarse flour. What else? The roasted flour my wife sent me. A few spoonfuls here and there. You didn't eat too much in case you couldn't stand it. You had to learn. She put oil in the flour, grilled flour in oil. I ate it slowly, and it kept me alive. I had traded a Swiss watch for 1.5 kg of cereals in ration stamps. I had asked someone to trade it for me in Jiuquan. I had to let it for 500g of stamps, but at least, he brought back some treats. It wasn't easy! You traded a Swiss watch for 1.5 kg in cereal stamps and a wool blanket for 1 or 1.5 kg. Communication channels weren't easy, either. It was just before... before... before New Year's in 1961. Could you still walk? With great difficulty. I left the central station in a horse-drawn cart. It took us... It took us... It was supposed to take us to the road, but as no vehicle passed by, we carried on in it to Jiuquan. We spent the night in Jiuquan. The next day, we managed to buy train tickets. We spent a night in Lanzhou before coming back to Tianshui. My wife went to a lot of trouble to get me out of there. The camp management had to wait for the green light from the delegation in charge to release me. Or I wouldn't go home. The last to return en masse had to wait till March and April. March and April 1961. How many came home to Tianshui? About 10 maybe. At the end, it was atrocious. One night, I was told to go bury the dead in exchange for an extra ladle of gruel and... and some black bread. I refused, thinking I couldn't do it. We were bedridden! We couldn't move. I still had to go. We hoisted up to 6 bodies on the cart. We dug a shallow hole and we covered the body with some dirt. The slightest gust of wind uncovered the bodies. On a red brick, we wrote: Grave of XXX. That's how it was. All buried in the ravine! The principal of High School no. 1, Ren Jiwen, died there. His wife, from Shanghai, is now head of the Mother & Child Health Center. Ren Jiwen came from Gangu. The head of High School no. 1! Died there. When his wife came to the camp, we'd buried him long before. Long before. What we lived in Jiabiangou, no-one wrote it. With all the suffering we had there, who would have wanted to write about it? Those who lived Jiabiangou don't write. What's the point? You imagine an unforgettable landscape? Not worth it. There are some photos, but they're not great. You see a woman standing in the ruins. - In Jiabiangou. - In the desalination trenches? Not trenches, the holes we lived in! Caves? There are photos in magazines. Did you live there? No. Where did you stay there? I was on the construction team and I worked outside on the construction sites. We slept in tents. Is that where you ran away from? I ran away when I was in Jiuquan. What were you doing in Jiuquan? I don't remember that. In novels, everything is told in detail. It was hard and we were hungry. Do you think it was a picnic? We were starving. We had to beg. Yet you were on the construction team? The construction team was rationed, too. We had 10 or 12 kilos of grain a month, no more. What do you think? It was no picnic! Did you think we were living the good life? It's not what you think. In winter, we slept in tents. It was very cold. We'd get up at dawn and we were given a spongy cake. All white and spongy. This big. Square. We got a piece each before going to work. It would have taken 7 or 8 to feed a man. Do you think one was enough? We would have needed 7 or 8. What do you expect? If you must know, I'll have to explain. Why don't I have kids? Because I'm not married! Where would these kids come from? I don't need to draw you a picture! The ones you see here aren't my family. They're photos of my brothers' kids. They're my nephews, see? - Your nephews. - Yes, my nephews. And my nephews' children! But you have a wife, right? That's what I was trying to explain. I'd been married for barely a year when the anti-rightist movement began. I was accused and sent to Jiabiangou. And my wife went off with someone else. She found someone else. Now you understand! It wouldn't help to give you more details, would it? I went to the labor re-education camp and my wife filed for divorce to go off with another. That's what happened. Since then, I've lived like this. I've spent my whole life like this. My whole life. And I'll spare you the details. It wasn't easy, but what's the point of telling you all that? I'm not the only one in this situation. Many people experienced the same thing, but they don't want to talk about it. It's destiny. We Chinese say: "It's your destiny!" And if I've had this life, it's destiny too. That's how destiny decided it, without wanting to be superstitious. That's what you must understand. Everything I own, I bought it with the money I earned by working, not with public money. Oh, no! I should have been given a pension by the store, by the department store in Tianshui. But it doesn't exist anymore. Who can I ask for it? Even though some people know my situation, they won't talk. They won't talk! Why would they talk? It's all in the past. Those from Mao Zedong's time know what this is all about. They don't say anything either! What are broken homes? Nowadays, families aren't like they used to be. Those who were in Jiabiangou... Those who... Those who were in Jiabiangou are all... They're all dead. Their families didn't even know they were there. That's so with many. I'm not the only one not talking. And you're lucky you met me first. You're interested in Jiabiangou! No-one wants to discuss it. And most are dead. Yes, they're dead. Do you drink that alcohol? At least you know what it is! And yet you don't drink. You don't drink and you know it. Among drinkers, most... Here, even in the restaurant, lovers of alcohol don't know "Red Star" erguotou. And yet "Red Star" white liquor represents China today. I only stayed for a year and a half in Jiabiangou. Then, I ran away. I fled. On your own? I wasn't particularly daring. Many of us ran away at the time. They just don't say it. Today, people don't talk about that time. It's not appropriate to talk about it. I stayed several years at Shaanxi. I stayed 3 and a half years. 3 and a half years. I escaped from Jiabiangou and went to Shaanxi. Because when you escape, you become a fugitive! Was it better at Shaanxi? We could get by. In Shaanxi, I found myself in a re-education camp. But your life wasn't in danger there. Recently, I was hospitalized and I almost died. It was my heart. I've always been fragile, remember? They managed to revive me. They revived you? Good. The municipal hospital is well equipped now. Did you see a doctor about your kidney pain? There's no need. With some rest, it'll pass. I get up from time to time and I sit down for a bit. I don't understand why it hurts. It was OK before. I thought I was better. I've spent too long sitting. It tired me out. Were you writing? I sat down to pray. I still wonder why they sent us to Gaotai in the middle of winter for spring sowing. For sowing, first of all, we didn't have any seeds. Secondly, we didn't have any tools. Thirdly, we didn't know where to sow. Fourthly, there was no water. Fifthly, we had nowhere to stay. How could we cultivate the land like this? The most regrettable and incomprehensible thing was that they were sending the men before their luggage. I was in charge of luggage transport and I came last. The men were there, in the middle of nowhere, several dozen men all huddled up. They had just spent over 10 days outside, at temperatures of minus 20 degrees. I arrived last with all the luggage. Professor Li's wife brought him food. Or he would have starved to death. If I'm still alive, it's because of my mother. With Professor Li, it's thanks to his wife. My mother came one day when it was snowing very hard. The snow had covered our shelters, and she had a hard time finding us. - It was in Mingshui. - Near the station. When it snowed a lot, it was in Mingshui. Someone from Tianshui, Yang Yousheng. Yang Yousheng. One day, a friend came to see me. He was accompanied by a man I didn't know. They came together. The man was a preacher. He told me that his father was... the head of Jiabiangou. Jiabiangou was only part of a whole. The camp consisted of several places. He was the head of the whole thing. Jiabiangou was just one division. He had received an order from the Province to give only 200 grams of cereals a day to prisoners. 200 grams per person per day. After receiving this order, his father, who was an early veteran, a veteran of the Red Army who had his say, 200 grams... He refused to obey. He drew from the reserves to guarantee 24 pounds of grain. Some time later, someone turned him in. He was removed from office. Once revoked, he was transferred to Lanzhou where he was inactive for 3 years. That's what the document says. Reducing the ration to 200g was an order from above! They wanted to starve you to death. It was deliberate. It's terrible, isn't it? - Failure to supply grain. - He died in 1981. He was a Red Army veteran. - Is that what this document says? - Yes. I asked this friend to put everything in writing on this document. This document is terrible! It was deliberate! - Was there any grain? - Yes. There was some... but they didn't give it out. They wanted to see you starve to death. It's a terrible revelation! 200 grams to say we fed you without allowing you to live! The peasants of Jiabiangou that I questioned told me that with 200 grams a day, they couldn't stand up. They leaned against the walls and on their sticks. I didn't know about the peasants. I just knew about the prisoners. There were 4 professors from Lanzhou University who hung themselves there. Did you see him? He told us. - That man? - Yes, he heard it from his father. What did you bring your husband in Jiabiangou? In Jiabiangou? I brought him... I brought him hard-boiled eggs. - You had eggs? - And flax seed cakes. 5 or 6, this big. It was in... in 1960. In December 1960... I received a telegram telling me that his health had deteriorated significantly and asking me to go. I took a week off and I went there. It was in December. At first, I set off on foot. There was no transport. Vehicles were very rare between Tianshui and Beidao. Vehicles were very rare. I set off on foot from Tianshui. To Ershipu. There I found a horse-drawn cart. A man who was transporting something. I asked him if he could take me on his cart. - To Beidao. - To the station? To Beidao station. When we arrived, it was almost nighttime. I took the train and I arrived in Lanzhou shortly before dawn. In Lanzhou, I had to change. I took another train to Jiuquan. In the train, between Lanzhou and Jiuquan, I met a woman. She was making the same journey. She lived in Lanzhou, and her husband was in Jiuquan. She was going to see him. We made the trip together. We kept each other company. Once we got there, as I'd never been there, the woman guided me. She took me into town. It was already nighttime. She took me to someone who had a horse-drawn cart and who took goods to the re-education camp. A man with a cart. She said that the 2 times she'd been to see her husband, she'd slept at their place. She introduced me to these people so I could spend the night. They didn't want to put me up. The next day, the man had to deliver coal to Mingshui, but he didn't want to take me. Let's just say he wanted to be paid. He could see I had several bags. He wanted something in exchange. As I was naive, I put my bags down, and in a momentary lapse of concentration, he helped himself and took 2 cakes. I still insisted, and he took me. We left at around 10 AM and we arrived late in the afternoon. We arrived at Mingshui at around 6 PM. I stayed there for 3 or 4 days. In Mingshui... I stayed for several days in Mingshui. I introduced myself to the head who put me in the dormitory. It was a huge troglodyte shelter. Really huge! They slept on the ground in an area this high. There was earth with some grass on top. There was Professor Pu. I even used his mattress for the night! I huddled up against my husband. Men and women all slept in the same place. I slept, snuggled up against him. When I woke up, the snow had fallen. It was so cold! Was your husband still able to get up? He could, but he was skinny, as skinny as a nail! - He could stand up. - Did you sleep in the shelter? Yes, for 2 days. Then we were told to sleep with the carpenters. They had their place. We slept with them. I spent 2 nights there before I went home. - Mingshui had a carpentry shop? - Yes. Did you come back with Professor Li? Did you come back with Professor Li? We left and came back the same day. Incredible, isn't it? We left on May 8, 1958 and came home in late December 1960. Do you know why I'm so sure? We spent the New Year on the train to Lanzhou. My son Minmin doesn't want me to have visitors. He's worried I'll get too tired. Minmin is worried. How many years since you last saw him? Oh, my! - What is it, Xiaozhen? - Don't worry! Don't ask questions and sleep. He's just filming a bit. Don't talk. Close your eyes. - Alright. - He's just filming. - Rest. - I left him the phone number. Do you want me to call Liu Tianyou? Don't worry, I gave him the number. When I was in the camp at Mingshui, I worked for what they called the central. In other words... Before, it was a State farm in the Gaotai district. It was a very simple place! It had only huts made of earth, without even a tiled roof. Mud-brick huts with a small kitchen. The rooms were really small. Two rooms for the cadres to sleep in and a small, separate room that we used as a kitchen. Another small barrack, on the edge of a valley, housed the infirmary, with its medicines and doctors. Other than that, everyone slept under the tent, at least until people began to arrive in mass from Xintiandun. I was on the installation team. I arrived there very early on. I remember that at the time, the director of Jiabiangou was Liu Zhenyu. And the head of the Production brigade was called Liang. - Liang Jingxiao. - Yes, Liang Jingxiao. Liang Jingxiao was from Lintao. As he was responsible for Jiabiangou's agricultural production, I took him with me. With his men, we were supposed to set up the future camp at Mingshui. But what could we do in a place like that? At first, I took care of the stewardship. At Jiabiangou, I was already in charge of the collective kitchens. We cooked for over 1,000 people who were in re-education at the camp. And as there were Hui Muslims, we had two separate kitchens. In 1959, faced with the increasing numbers of deaths, we also created a kitchen for the sick. At Jiabiangou, the situation was still acceptable. The problems began at the end of 1960, when we were transferred to Mingshui. The conditions there dictated life at the camp. Food was strictly rationed. When I got to Mingshui, the ration allocated to rightists by the government was 250 grams of course grain per person. The cadres were allowed 14 kg of flour. That was 450g per day. Let's see... The cadres received flour. The camp inmates, with their 250g of grains, had around 200g of flour. What was Jiabiangou like when you arrived? A re-education camp... reform through work, for criminals. From July 1956, the only people who stayed there to work were those who had completed their sentences. It became a professional farm. When the professional farm was created, I took care of the management. I managed the cadres' kitchen. Later on, I became an instructor. And then, I was transferred to the Secretariat. In the beginning, I was a clerk, then, I became a secretary. From the end of 1956 until the month of July 1958, I was a secretary. In 1958... In 1958, with the mass arrival of rightists, the kitchens were quickly overwhelmed. The population increased because of those who had to be re-educated! Daily life became unmanageable and I was asked to resume management of the stewardship. I had a team of managers and accountants, I was in charge of the kitchens, basically, I looked after everything. Let's say I managed the daily life. As I said earlier, that included managing 2 kitchens, but also the Xintiandun annex. Managing the food was also one of my duties. From 1959, food began to be scarce. Why wasn't there enough? If we relied on our production, our self-sufficiency would only last for a few months. So we depended on the State, but the quantities were rationed. I remember the grain ration was 21 kg, which meant 20 kg of flour. That was enough. In 1958 and 1959, there was still enough. But from 1960, the situation got worse. - Why? - What? Why was there not enough food in 1960? Why? Because they didn't give us anymore! Restrictions had been announced for everybody. They spoke of natural disasters to explain the lack of grains. Ridiculous! Some regions never stopped producing. But others inflated figures to earn merit and "to fan the winds of Communism." Because of "balanced distribution", we started to lack food. As if we lacked cereal! A farm is a unit of cereal production. If you don't produce enough, the State makes up for the lack, but that's how they'd catch you out! Were people very dispersed at the Mingshui site? They were spread across 3 valleys. There was the East valley, called the "central", and later on, the "East station". Then, as there were more and more deaths, we gathered together at the Middle station. I went to deliver coal for the first time towards the end of December and that's when I discovered that the Middle station existed. There were few sheep. The carcasses came from Jiabiangou. When was that? In December. The situation was terrible. It was the end for all those people! They didn't even get up anymore. They died in their sleep. They didn't wake up. Working and receiving only two ladles of gruel. Two small ladles of pale gruel thickened with a little flour. Cooked meals were out of the question there! Two spoonfuls that weren't even enough to warm you up. People were dying of hunger, damn! They lived in dug out holes in the desert. They cut plants without their roots, and slipped them under their sleeping area. For nothing! Those plants don't hold heat like straw. It was ridiculous! To put those people through... They wanted them to die. When you got to Mingshui, did you plant crops? What would we have planted? We were already well into autumn. I arrived in October, after the national holiday. We came to Jiabiangou as scouts, after the national holiday. Our mission was to start to organize the lands, to lay the foundations for the following year. We were meant to plant the crops in the spring of '61. But the cold weather arrived shortly after we did! There was no longer any chance of farming the land. We were told to compensate for the lack of cereals with vegetables. Vegetables in the desert when we only had sand to eat! There was nothing. Produce, always produce! Start planting crops when temperatures bordered on -40 degrees in winter! What could we plant? What did you do in the beginning? It was ridiculous! We dug trenches, built roads, and erected tents. We cleared sterile lands! It was a waste of time given the state of the land. They were easing their consciences. Clear and work the land! None of the land was flat. What could we do with it? We had barely started the work when we were forced to stop. What could we do? The men no longer had the strength to move. Also, agriculture is governed by the seasons. What can you do in winter? With temperatures that drop to below 38 degrees, can you farm the land? It is as hard as steel. A layer of frozen soil over one meter thick! Land that is frozen for over one meter in depth, can it be farmed? Sending the men there, was condemning them in advance. All those rightists dying of hunger, how were they meant to fight off death? How many people survived Mingshui? After I left, I don't know how many of them remained. So many of them died! We didn't really know how many of us there were. Death brings about situations... How could we have kept a precise record? That wasn't part of my job. No real strategy had actually been set up. This had nothing to do with the old re-education centers, that were divided into sections: the Production section... The Surveillance and Re-education section, and the Accounting section that incorporated Supplies. Everything was clearly organized. We went to Mingshui as a temporary measure. "The sparrow may be small, it still needs all its entrails." Otherwise nothing works! We had no system established and nothing definite in place. Was the number of deaths recorded on a daily basis? Yes, it was recorded. Well, in the beginning we managed. Later on... We couldn't dig, the ground was as hard as steel. The deceased were rolled up in their blankets, tied at each end with the cords from their bags and placed on a cart. The horses limped to the foot of the dune. We barely dug down and sometimes the wind blew, burying the bodies under the sand. Sometimes, the wind uncovered the bodies. It was horrendous. I won't say any more. After the North-West Conference, the authorities decided to put a stop to these deaths. A place like Mingshui, with caves for shelters, had to be replenished from the outside. Cereals needed to be sent there. The nearest supplies were in Gaotai. There was nothing left to eat on site. There weren't even anymore plants for the straw mats. Even water was a problem, so food... The conditions were really extreme. It was in the month of December 1960, that we began to leave the premises. At that time, the authorities sent us... They came with coaches, coaches with seats. To take us back to the Gaotai farm camp. To Jianquanzi, the farm's central station. They had made a large barracks available for everyone to sleep in. In my case... I can't remember exactly. It's too far away in my memory. Was everyone transferred by coach to the farm in Gaotai? One journey was not enough. The first time, there was only one coach. The transfer took a long time. People were transferred gradually. The move took over ten days. Did some people go straight to Lanzhou? - No! - Without going through Gaotai. Everyone went through Gaotai. I remember that everyone was taken to the Gaotai farm. The mortality issue was far from resolved. We could say the situation did improve a little. Some say that they took the train directly from Mingshui. That was much later on! At first, they sent the doctors to Gaotai. A first coach was sent ahead, to prepare the field. As I knew the managers of all the camps, I also left in the first convoy. How was the Mingshui camp shut down? I had already left. I didn't go back there. They kept me at the Gaotai farm. I had so much to do there. The Mingshui farm gradually emptied during the month of December. It was evacuated. The modest remaining activity was transferred to Gaotai. And, like you said, some people had to leave by train from Mingshui. If you are asking, people did leave by train from Mingshui to Lanzhou, but that was later on. Before... I had already left Mingshui. Why return to a hellish place like that? So I can't tell you how they closed the camp. Some cadres had stayed there. I remember going back there once after the transfer. I went to the Middle station in Mingshui where the director Liu Zhenyu had stayed. People who'd been scattered around were gathered at the Middle station. People from the East and West stations had all been taken there. To a dry river bed! With makeshift shelters dug out of the ground. It must have been around... It must have been in January 1961, or at the end of 1960, around December 20. Between the end of 1960 and the beginning of 1961. One day, when I was walking, I bumped into the director of the Jiuquan tool factory, Li Qingming. He signaled to me. "I want you to take me there." "Tell me what's happening first." "How can I put it... "I need you to talk to Liu." I was close to the director, and he knew I could talk to him easily. He said to me: "Apparently in Mingshui, they kill sheep to save the lives of the sick. Can you tell Liu that I've bought coal, and ask him for a sheep in exchange?" "I don't know if that's possible but I will ask him. Alright! I'll ask him. I'll tell him that transporting coal is a tough job. I'll get what you want!" And we set off. When we got there, Liu was happy! Without coal, you couldn't do anything. To boil water, warm yourself, cook your gruel, you needed fire. I spoke to director Liu. "Alright!", he said. It was the way to maintain a good relationship. "We had to find a vehicle, to bring the coal here." He gave us a sheep. At the time, I was getting ready to go to Lanzhou. My wife was studying at the Lanzhou school of Chinese medicine. I had decided to join her. He accepted without batting an eyelid! He chose the sheep. He cut its head off and removed all of its guts to give us the carcass. Once the animal had been gutted, it weighed between 10 and 15 kilos. A small carcass. I said: "I'm leaving for Lanzhou and I'd really like some meat too." We did what we could to survive. Liu said to me: "Take that one and ask Li to share it with you." What could I say? We took the sheep and they gave me 1.5 kg of meat. They cut off the head with half of the neck. They offered me a thigh but I refused. A piece of the breast was enough for me. Even if when I returned, I'd have to share. I had to think of the driver and there wasn't very much. It was good because the opportunity had arisen and food was scarce, so why complain? There may have been sheep in Jiabiangou and elsewhere, but at Mingshui there was nothing. I was already in Gaotai when I made this visit to the Middle station of Mingshui. About one week later, everybody had left the Middle station. Only those who could still walk had taken the train in Mingshui. Indeed, some did take the train. Liu Zhenyu waited until everybody had left, to return to Gaotai. When he arrived, he asked me to go to West station in Gaotai. Death was a part of our daily lives. There was no point being afraid. When the nurses weren't able to lift the bodies, you helped lift them onto the cart and stabilize it. But you weren't meant to do things that weren't part of your duties. As if we could have shown compassion for those men! And there was your class conscience! Who could bear being submitted to the criticisms? I promised myself I would not treat anyone badly. That wasn't the case of some heads of teams who took it out on the men if the work was badly done. They deprived you of food, those little chiefs! Some production managers were cruel to the men. So it became normal to live alongside death? It was part of our daily lives. A sad reality. A reality that aroused neither sorrow nor surprise. An oil lamp threatening to go out for which you have no fuel to revive it. People didn't die during the day. When someone died, they were taken outside. The others didn't even realize. We gathered the bodies in the evening and took care of them the next day. - Where did you put them? - I didn't deal with them. If I wasn't on duty, I didn't stay around the sick. What was the point? Witnessing that misery! It affects you and you can't do a thing. You can't change the course of things. That roughly sums up the situation. It's past history, but everything I told you really did happen. In the past, I tried to establish a clear boundary between us and the enemy. As a cadre, your position had to be clear. If your opinions were wrong, you exposed yourself to criticism. What would you have done? Faced with inappropriate ideas or a malfunction, you had no rights nor power. Even the farm's management had no say. No matter if you thought you were faultless, the slightest mistake, the tiniest inappropriate thought, and you were criticized immediately. You no longer dared say anything. A cadre from Public Security who wasn't inflexible? Impossible. It was a matter of principles. You got used to living in that kind of environment. If you didn't have outright power, you couldn't do anything. Right? The reality was as simple as that and the hierarchy was very strict! Who would have dared to act on their thoughts? You got your work done with no room for negotiation. There was no place for compassion even faced with certain conduct... But our integrity had to restrain us so that we'd never lose control, never insult or mistreat people who had lacked discipline. Because that was illegal! Did that happen often? Sometimes, but never excessively. Public Security was subject to discipline. They weren't able to do whatever they wanted. Especially as rightists were different from other criminals. They weren't guarded by armed police like the other criminals. Also, the length of their sentences, as I told you. Undetermined length for the rightists, and 5 to 10 years for the others, who, if they behaved well, were able to make an application to the courts. Their sentence could be revised and their release brought forward. But the rightists, they might delude themselves with hope! It was the end for them. They had hit jackpot! What could we have done? Some of them were senior civil servants, who had gotten into trouble with their superiors who then engineered a plan against them. Some of the accusations were false or had been exaggerated. There was nothing rightist about them. Even if we knew this, we couldn't say anything. Your class and the opinions you were meant to hold didn't give you that right. So? Who would have dared defend them? It was a death sentence! They were accused of being members of an anti-Party clique, but they weren't against the Party. They'd just made some criticisms about the Committee's communist comrades. But shortly after, the anti-rightist campaign revived the attacks against those sanctioned by the previous movement. They were found to be rightist without having said anything. They hadn't said a single word and yet they were called rightist. After that, they were sent to the re-education labor camp. I also found myself implicated. I had raised the following question: Since the formerly convicted members of the Party can get their jobs back, now we no longer talk about an anti-Party clique, is it possible that the others also be rehabilitated and get their jobs back? Those who had been demoted, sanctioned and cast aside, couldn't we consider that they be rehabilitated during the anti-rightist campaign? I suggested to the Party that it would be fair that these people be recalled from exile and sent home. For me, the question of non-communists was settled much too severely. So, my case was reviewed and I was accused of being a rightist. We were now two convicts, left to our own devices. He was transferred from Zhangjiachuan to Jiabiangou. You couldn't see each other? As they had to go through Tianshui, they let him come home. He must have stayed in all for about 20 minutes. That day, he took the writings of Mao Zedong. He was happy. He said to me: "Don't look after my business!" He seemed to be saying... "There, I can re-educate myself. I will be made a new man. I'll get a new look." The works of Mao Zedong under his arm, he left. When he called in at home, he dropped off his things and took others. He gave me some recommendations and left. As he went, he was full of hope. He seemed really... really hopeful. He wasn't particularly prepared. He just took the clothes he needed. People had told him it was a good place. Once they got there, they were told it was being turned into a sort of idyllic farm where families would be allowed. He told us that one day, we could all move in. - Is that what he wrote from there? - Yes, he did. He died 2 years later. He went to Jiabiangou in October 1958. At this time of year. No, it was in September! After the 15th of the 8th month of the lunar calendar. At first, in his letters, he told me what their work involved. Not once did I hear him complain. How often did he write? At the start, he could still write. Then, his health declined. He couldn't stand due to hunger. When he wrote, he asked me to send walnuts, because he was constipated. His bowel movements stopped. We didn't know he was living in far harder conditions than us. We didn't know. But when we sent him food, he didn't receive it. He asked me for roasted flour, but it never reached him. The cadres must have intercepted the parcels. One day, I sent him a blanket in which I had hidden a pound of roasted flour. For a while, I was under surveillance at work. Then I was called back to school. Under surveillance in the factory, then called back to resume my classes at school. At the time, I had my 4 children with me. I had to leave them at home alone. I did that till they went to school. My children are 1 to 2 years apart. Did you have enough to eat? At the time, no-one had enough to eat. That's why he didn't want me to send food anymore. He told me to find food for the children. He couldn't imagine the difficulties we had here. But he insisted that I didn't send food. When his health degenerated terribly and he couldn't stand, Li Jinghang's wife and others went to visit him. I couldn't go because of the children. Imagine, their paternal grandmother threw herself down a well, and their grandfather was in prison. I couldn't go. Other families said: "Let's go see them and bring them some sustenance." I couldn't. I couldn't because of the children. My family was in Beijing, my little sister was abroad, my mother looked after the children. I couldn't tell her about my situation. They didn't know. My husband didn't want me to help him by sending anything. Just some walnuts for his constipation. Actually, hunger gnawed at him, but above all, he wanted me to take care of the children. That's what he asked me in his letters. In the last letter he sent me, they were waiting for an inspection by central government. "I have to last another 3 days!" he said. The inspectors were due 3 days later. The administration said he died on December 27. When he was in Jiabiangou, he asked my little sister to send him from Beijing books which cost several dozen yuans. He wanted to acquire knowledge in physiology and hygiene care. As he had become too weak, he'd been sent to work in the infirmary to look after the sick. He'd taken this care mission to heart. But he needed medical knowledge, hence the books he had requested. I sent some to him in Jiabiangou. When he died, they sent the books back to me. I still have one left. It's his writing. The only writing I have of his. That is what he says. He had his convictions. How did you get that book back? It was in his things they sent me back when he died. Did the farm send them back? Yes. They sent them back. I had several children I raised on my own. All 3 of them had measles. I took one to the hospital one night. He also had pneumonia. I dropped him off at home and took the 2nd. He had his shot, I brought him home and took the 3rd on my back. The nurse said to me: "At this rate, you won't be home before dawn!" And indeed, I had to run to the factory where my work was supervised. Oh, yes! I left my 3 children at home with measles. With the fever they had, they couldn't stand up. I could only put them back in bed when I got home. They got over the measles and dysentery. Such young children managed to recover. I was worried about the one with pneumonia, but he survived. I couldn't take any time off. In my situation, who would have dared give me a day off? I had to wait till work was over to take care of my children. Sometimes I worked till midnight. It was the time of the Great Leap Forward. When I got home after midnight, I'd go to bed, fully clothed. The children were sleeping in a row. I'd go to bed without taking my shoes off. At 4 AM, I'd get up and give each child a bread roll before going to work. That was how we lived. When he hadn't been there long, my husband asked me, as if apologizing for the question: "You must still have some corn flour or roasted flour we can't get here. Sometimes I feel like having a little cereal. If you have too much at home, don't hesitate to make some for me." That's what he said. He implied he was short of food without daring to demand it. When I read it, of course I thought: He doesn't have enough to eat. We had 800g of wheat per person per month. Once the grain was made into flour, I didn't give it to the kids. I prepared it by roasting it. For them, I made some corn flour or another kind of flour that I roasted. There was a pinch for each child. Then I sent him his flour. Initially, the first 2 times, he received it all. Then he didn't get anything. How did I get it to him? I was told: "If you want it to reach him, you must hide it in a blanket. Wrap it inside and don't tell the Post Office." Or you'll get yelled at! "Why is your husband an exception? You mustn't send any food!" They told me so. That's why I was told to hide it in a parcel. And it did get to him. But after that, nothing got to him. He said there was point sending him anything else. He couldn't even exchange ration stamps for food. He told me not to send any more and to make sure the children had enough to eat. That's it. Later on, we lost touch. I kept writing, but he didn't answer. I knew it was critical, but I didn't lose hope. I thought that his health had declined temporarily, but that he'd get better. When he could no longer stand, he said to me: "You must get organized and think of the children. Get married to a worker or a peasant. Find someone from a good class background so you don't make our children bear such a burden." That's what he said. When did you receive notification of his death? When I received... when I learned... He stopped writing and I knew that was a bad sign, but there was no other way of getting news. It was only in late January or early February that the farm informed us. The wife of a leader from Zhangchuan United Front made the journey. Her husband, much younger than us, had died there in re-education. When she came back, as she had been there, she told us about the situation. Since our husbands were both from Zhangchuan, she had asked the camp cadres who confirmed the death certificate had been sent. She hadn't brought his belongings back, because his coat, for example, was worn by a cadre who had gone to look after the sick. He was supposed to return it when he came back. We never got it back. My husband was dead. What use was it to me? As for the rest of his things, the camp administration sent them to the station. We had a receipt to go get them. They looked a mess. They were all dirty. They lived... in caves, and their things were black with soot. His blanket was all burned. It was totally soiled, covered in blood and pus. As for the bowl wrapped in the blanket, it was filthy. Bran and grain residue were stuck everywhere. It'd dried on the edges. I couldn't even say if it was his bowl. I think it must have been his bowl and his chamber pot. They packed it all up and returned it to us. There was nothing presentable. There were still a few shirts that he hadn't wanted to damage at work. They were there, still clean. Had the farm sent you notification of his death? Yes, they'd sent it. They'd written: "Died of heart failure." The children knew. No-one went to get the parcel. We didn't dare to. We knew that the day the mailman brought the notice to get the parcel, it wouldn't be a good sign. We knew that. The children got down on their knees and begged the neighbors to go get the parcel for their mother. "Our dad must be dead," they said. The eldest wasn't very big then. We apprehended that day which finally came. This eventuality terrified us and indeed, his things arrived. We received notification of his death, but we also knew the organization left a lot to be desired, so we started hoping they'd made a mistake. When the luggage arrived, we were faced with reality. We had confirmation, irrefutable proof. Zhang Junqi came back from Jiabiangou. He had fallen for "individual heroism". He was accused being a criminal who'd displayed individual heroism, so they sent him to Jiabiangou. He managed to hold out and survived. He came home in 1961. And it was at the end of 1962 that we started a new family. He was able to get his teaching job back. He taught at Tianshui High School no. 1. In Jiabiangou, he had been abused and had escaped several times. But he'd managed to save his skin. It's because of all this that we were able to start a family. With all this suffering, we understood each other. I didn't follow my former husband's recommendations. He'd told me to marry a worker or a peasant and that if we had nothing in common, it didn't matter, because I had to think of our children. They shouldn't bear the burden of a family from a poor class. That was his point of view. But I was well aware how impossible it was! How could a worker or a peasant agree to marry someone like me? It was unrealistic. So, I started living with Zhang Junqi. We used to be colleagues at Tianshui Normal School. During the Cultural Revolution, they accused him of being the leader of a clique of conservatives. During the Revolution, the rebel groups mistreated him so badly that he was found half-paralyzed and with high blood pressure. He lived like that until he died in 1984. From the Cultural Revolution until 1984? Until 1984. He's the father of my 2 youngest children. When my first husband's health declined towards the end, he pretty much stopped writing. He didn't want... He was afraid we'd worry about him and above all, that we'd visit him. He was scared of that. He never talked about the abuse. Even towards the end, he didn't talk about his living conditions over there, the humiliations and abuse he suffered. He just said his health wasn't good and asked me to put all my hopes in the children. He said not to expect any more of him. That's what he said. At the time, he didn't have the strength to sit up after going to the bathroom. But he still wrote that letter. That was the last one. There was no point writing to him, the letters didn't arrive. Was December 27 the day he died? I still wonder about that. I still wonder...
