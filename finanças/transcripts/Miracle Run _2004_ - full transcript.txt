- [TV narrator] Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, Superman! [Dramatic music] - Superman. - [Clark] Lois, what are you doing here? - [Lois] Oh, just getting a woman's angle on this story. [Whistling] - [Man] The mechanical monster, look out! [Dramatic music] - What have you done with the jewels? - What have you done with the jewels? - Cold. Oh, Steven, that's beautiful. Almost time to go, guys. - Just on more step and she's doomed. - One more step and she's doomed. - This new doctor's very nice. I think you guys'll like her. [Paper ripping] [Sirens blaring] [Philip whimpering] - [Pa] Doctor Stein to radiation oncology, please. Doctor Stein to radiation oncology. - Hello, miss Morgan, I'm Dr. Patrick. - Hey. - Hi. Hi, guys. Can you tell me what your name is? And where do you live? [Lights buzzing] You live up there? [Indistinct hospital announcements] Miss Morgan, do they make any sounds at all? - Philip can repeat things verbatim, but never speaks on his own. Steven, no. - No? - No. What does that mean? - Too soon to tell, but it means they're capable of speech. At least he is. It means the equipment works anyway. Let's go into my office, okay? - I've been to see half a dozen doctors, they all say the same thing. Boys develop slower than girls, twins sometimes develop their own language, be glad your boys are healthy, they'll come around. - Well, why don't we bring them on down and this shouldn't take more than an hour, okay? - The equipment works anyway. - [Laughs] That it does. [Dramatic music] Pay attention to how he lines up the blocks. See what happens when you try and take a turn. This one at least appears to respond to verbal cues from the mother and he's a pretty good mimic. Full word formation and intonation. Miss Morgan? - Yeah? - Why don't you join US? Come on in. You can have a seat right here. Well, it is a rather remarkable find. - A find? - Fraternal twins with autism. - I'm sorry, did you say autistic? - They both exhibit unusual gaze behavior and odd social affect. We noted obvious sensory issues, hyperacusis, for example. Philip uses immediate echolalia. He repeats what he hears. They don't display stereotypical motor patterns, but the signs of cognitive development that we observed are good prognostic indicators. Autism is a brain disorder that effects social interaction and communication skills. [Car horn honking nearby] [Sirens blaring nearby] [Cart rattling] - No. No. No, no! I said no. No! No! [Twins whining] - No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable. - I'm so sorry. Shh, no! [Twins shouting] Oh, I'm sorry. Sir, I'm so sorry. Shh, shh, shh. I'll clean it up, i'm cleaning it up. I'm so... - You should control your children. - Hold this. [Twins shouting] Let's go. Let's go! [Twins whining] [Sirens blaring nearby] [Dog barking nearby] - Corrine? Hun? Hey. - Oh, you're early. - Well, your message was kind of weird. The boys have a meltdown? - No, I did. I took them to see Dr. Patrick today. They're autistic. They have autism. - God. - I don't know what to do. I tried all those doctors. They'll never get better. It'll never go away, they'll never have normal lives. - Neither will we. Not even close. - [Quietly] I see. - This isn't fair. I fell in love with you. I didn't sign up for this. Autistic boys and... - Oh, no, you're right, you didn't. It's not fair and you didn't sign up for it. After all, you're not their father, are you? - I can't do it, corrine. I just need to be honest with you. [Corrine sighs] I'm sorry.

[Car door bangs shut] - Hey. - Hey. - I took a little money out, just what I had when we met, I'll need it. - Don't worry about it. - I've got it. - You sure this is what you want? - Don't act like you're not relieved. - You know that's not fair. I was honest with you, corrine, would you have preferred it otherwise? - I'd prefer it if... The boys are out there, do you want to say goodbye or something? Uh, nevermind. It might upset them. Bye. [Birds singing] [Trunk slams shut] [Train whistling nearby] [Dramatic music] Okay, come on. Okay, this is gonna be our new home for a little while. All right? [Philip moaning] - I'm scared, too. We're gonna be all right, fellas. [Door bangs shut] [Pen clicks] - Good afternoon, good afternoon. Ho-ho, so you're looking for a place to live? Well, look no further, friend, look no further! Hoo, I got such a good place for you. - [Corrine] How much? - [Cartoon] Just the little place for you and your woman. Oh, way up there, way up there. - Well, I know that it's been empty for a while. Why don't you rent it to me and I can make some improvements? Okay, well... You'll get back to me, then, right? Thank you. Oh, Steven! Ah, dammit, the clock! No, Steven, this doesn't belong to US!

[Corrine sighs] [Rain falling] [Clock clicks] [Alarm blaring] Whatever's going on in that beautiful head of yours sure is remarkable. [Clock clicks] [Keys jangling] Okay. - [Agent] You understand all the terms of the agreement? - [Corrine] Yes. - And um, I guess that's it then. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Ta-da, our new home! What do you think, huh? Come in, come on in. Come on in. Okay, all right, we'll just wait here until you're ready. - Until you're ready. - Do you want to see your new bedroom? It's super cool. No? All right, we'll just wait here. It's all right, bud. I think you're gonna like it. [Mouse clicks] [Gentle music] Yeah, I'm calling regarding your ad for um, babysitting services. Right, I have uh, a situation. I have twins and they're autistic. Right, okay. Thanks, bye. [Corrine sighs] [Phone beeping] Um, I'm wondering do you take special needs kids? Right. No, autistic. Oh, nevermind, okay. Thanks. [Banging receiver] [Birds singing] Um, I should be home most nights by seven. - Mm-mm, has to be earlier. I belong to a jeopardy club and I have not missed a night in three years. - Okay, um... 6:30-ish? - You want me to make them dinner after I pick them up from school? - That'd be great. - Well, I'll give you a list of stuff that I like to eat. - Are you sure you're up for this? - I told you that I have taken care of three mentally retarded kids for four years. - They're not retarded. - I'm up for it is all I'm saying. [Gentle music] - I guess you're the one. - Wow. - So did you remember to bring your share? - Yeah. - Good, then I'll be outside at 3:00. - [Kid] Okay. - Okay, look for me out front. - Come on. All right? You ready? Let's go, go on. Go, go, go, go. Let's go. - Hi, boys. [Child shouting nearby] Hi, uh, miss Morgan, hi. - Hi. - Um, Steven and Philip can be a bit of a handful sometimes, you know? - Oh, don't I know it. [Laughs] - Yeah, and uh... While there are some things that they do very well, I'm just a little concerned that they're not where they should be academically speaking. - They'll come around, they just need a little time to get used to it is all. - Yeah, but... [School bell ringing] Well, i-- - bye. [Telephone ringing] I realize you don't have anything now, but could you hold on to my resume, just for the future in case something comes up or anything? - [Man] We'd be glad to. - Okay. [School bell rings] - Miss Morgan? I was approached by the principal and I wonder if you might meet with some of US, say tomorrow afternoon about four? - Concerning what? - We would just like to speak with you about the boys. - Steven hasn't spoken a word and Philip merely repeats what others say to him. - They're extremely shy. - Well, are they like that at home? - Is there a husband or a boyfriend in the house? - Why, is that important? - Well, they have these outbursts, as if they're angry. - Why would they be angry? - How do you discipline the boys? - What exactly are you getting at? - You needn't be defensive, miss Morgan. - If you have something you'd like to ask me I'd rather you just came out with it. - We don't want to find ourselves having to explain why we ignored signs of possible abuse. - Are you suggesting I somehow hurt my boys? - Their behavior suggests some sort of trauma in the past that's brought on-- - they're autistic! [School bell rings] I took them to a specialist a couple of weeks ago. I didn't know until then. - How could you not know? - We'd seen a dozen doctors, they said nothing was wrong. They have such remarkable talents. They deserve to be in a normal classroom with other kids. - It's just that it's impossible to teach them in a... A regular classroom, miss Morgan. - This school may not be the best place for them. [Corrine sighs] Do all kids who aren't perfect get kicked out of your school? [Gentle music] [Keyboard clacking] [Mouse clicks] [Keyboard clacking] [Lock clicking] - Uh-oh, looks like somebody pulled an all nighter. Hmm, looks so official. You created the legal letterhead and everything? Wow. - It's not too shrill? - No, no, it's great. You even got the lawyer speak down. [Chuckles] Just vague enough to be intimidating, with all the whereases and pursuant tos. - I did some research. The boys are entitled to more than I thought. For once I'm glad I pay taxes. [Laughs] [Corrine sighs] - What's wrong? - When they were little, I used to lie in bed at night and think about who they'd be when they grew up and how proud I'd be of them for succeeding. [Sighs] Now I just want them to be safe and happy, I don't have any expectations anymore. I think that's what hurts so much. - Well, one day you might be surprised. - I'd be up for a nice surprise. - Well, that letter is a great start, corrine. Now, you go out there and you give 'em hell and you let them know who they're dealing with. Now, where's the sugar? - The mouse heard the lion's loud roar and went to see what was the matter. The lion cried and cried with pain. - Cried and cried with pain. [Students laughing] - And looked at the little mouse and asked the little mouse if he would pull the Thorn from his paw. The little mouse grabbed hold of that Thorn-- - and cried and cried with pain. [Students laughing] - He grabbed hold of the Thorn and pulled it out of the lion's paw. - The board's suggestion is that we enroll the boys in the individual education plan at middleton mental hospital. Part of their outpatient day school. - You're kidding. - No, ma'am, we sincerely believe that's what's best for them. - I suggest you read this very carefully, Dr. Hardwick. My boys will have a normal education regardless of you and your asinine policies. I'll take you all the way to the supreme court if I have to. [Hardwick sighs] Oh, no, was there still skin on that one? Here, give it back. I'll peel you another one. [Sighs] Here you go, honey, here you go. [Twins whining] Oh, oh no, oh no, it's okay, it's okay. Mommy's here, listen, hey. Don't worry, mommy's here. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. See, isn't so much better under here? It's so much more fun. Just your crazy mom forgot to pay the electric bill. - Crazy mom. - Yeah, your crazy mom better find a job soon. Can I help you? - Corrine Morgan? - Yes. - Hi, I'm Wayne cosgrove. The school board sent me. - Are you an attorney? - I'm here for the boys, miss Morgan. - You're not taking my boys, Mr. cosgrove. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way. I'm a special education teacher. I'm here to work with your boys to prepare them for a regular classroom. - Who sent you? - I work for the state. I guess the school district found your lawyer's letter persuasive. Look, I'm gonna work with your boys and depending on their level of functionality, teach them to speak and eventually read and write. - To speak? - I understand they have a great set of lungs. - Um, when can you start? - I have my stuff in the car. [Gentle music] Do they understand what you say? Good, then they get it. Now all we have to do is teach them to express it. - How long might that take? - Oh, it depends on their level of autism. It's a long, slow process. But we'll work on it and I'll show you some things that we can work on together. Baby steps. [Gentle music] Chalk. [Steven moans] Chalk. Chalk. Repetition, lots and lots and lots of repetition. That's how you teach an autistic child. Chalk. - Chalk! - A mimic? This is gonna be fun. See? Chalk. You write with it. All right. [Car horns honking] - Two sons? I've got three, they run me ragged. - Oh! - I won't kid you, miss Morgan. Selling insurance is tough and competitive. You need to be very aggressive. - Oh, stop it, Taylor. That's Taylor's code for single women with no children seem to have more time to work. - Motherhood has taught me to manage my time quite well. - Well, that's good because we don't tolerate absences from work. - No problem. - Great, welcome to the team. - Thank you. - Look forward to working with you. - Great. [Crickets chirping] Pizza. Pizza. Pizza. - [Stammers] Pizza. - Oh! Oh, god, you said your first word! That's amazing! Pizza. Pizza. - Pizza. [Corrine laughs] - Pizza. - Say it again? Pizza. - Pizza. [Laughs] That's perfect. - Now these are blocks. Blocks. That's it. Find the ball. Find the ball in here, okay? You got a ball. Good job. All right. Blocks. Blocks, can you find a block? - Show me how you brush your hair Okay, watch this. Okay, good. - Look, this is an apple. An apple is red. It's round, sort of round. It's got a stem. B-o-w-l, bowl. Apple in a bowl. Feel this orange, feel that, huh? It's all rough. There's the orange. - Show me the apple. Good. Good boy, good. Okay. All right, show me the glass. Good. Show me the orange. [Philip moaning] It's okay, try it again. Red, show me red. Good. Show me yellow. Show me orange. [Quietly] Up and down. That's good. Oh, hey, hey. What's this? - Box. - Bag. It's a bag. But you were close. [Doorbell chimes] Hi. - Hey. - What's up? - I've been transferred. I can't work with you guys anymore. The state's run out of money for my program. [Corrine sighs deeply] - [Corrine] Can I fight it? - You could. But your time would be much better spent continuing to work on the stuff that I showed you. They are so close, corrine. They're learning so quickly. It's up to you now. You can do this, I know you can. - I don't know how to thank you. - You can invite me to their graduation, is what-- [toys clattering] [Philip moaning] - Right, I'll call you back. [Keyboard clacking] [Telephone rings] - This is corrine. Oh, oh, no they were happy to underwrite that, yeah. Sure, I can check on the umbrella for you. Yes, okay. You're welcome. Bye. [Gentle music] My guys on the first day of high school. Okay, good luck. Go on. Go, go, go! Good luck. - These guys are big. - Yeah. [Corrine sighs] [Twins humming theme to rocky] - Adrian! - Guys. Guys, hello! I'm going home now. - This is jeopardy! - Ha ha ha, very funny. - I'm going to be a fighter like rocky. - [Laughs] You better put some muscles on you little skinny thing. [Laughs] - Skinny thing. Steven is a skinny thing. - [Steven] So are you, Philip. - [Philip] I am? - Boys, boys. Time to start winding down, okay? Okay? Phil. Try not to do this, all right? [Tapping picture] - Okay. [Egg cracking] - What are you doing? - Rocky drinks raw eggs. - But you're not rocky, you're Philip. - But I want to be rocky. - No, you don't, you want to be like rocky. You should never want to be anybody else. Oh. [Philip gulping] [Philip spitting] - I don't like raw eggs. - [Laughs] Philip at raw eggs. [Dogs barking nearby] - Oh, for god's sake. Oh, man. Morning! - Good morning. - I'm going to get one of these. I'm going to build up my muscles. - Great. It's only 500 dollars. - Oh, what happened to your shoes? - Oh, I think you have a broken water pipe. I'm surprised you haven't noticed. - Oh, god. - It's your landlord's problem, not yours. - Right. - I threw up raw eggs last night all over the floor. - Congratulations. - I'm already gonna be late, would you make sure they get to the bus stop on time? - Please, yes. - It's a broken water pipe. The entire front lawn is flooded. Well, I'm not paying rent until you fix it! [Students chattering] - That's the third day in a row she smiled at you. - At US. - At you! She smiled at you. - Maybe she'll be my girlfriend. [Philip laughs] - Maybe she'll be my girlfriend. Dude! [Twins moaning] - They refuse to come out, miss Morgan, they seem very upset. They're in here. [Twins crying] - Oh, hey, hey, hey. Hey, guys, guys, what happened? What happened? What's wrong, what's wrong? - Can we just go home? - Oh, no, remember we don't do that anymore. We stay, we try to get through it. We don't quit and go home. - Do we have to? - Hey, what would rocky do, huh? Rocky wouldn't quit. He'd stay and he'd fight. He'd stay and fight and he wouldn't let anybody bring him down. [School bell rings] Hey, listen. Listen, listen, do you want to go to lunch? - They'll make fun of US! - Let 'em! Let 'em! Let 'em. They laughed at rocky, too, remember? [Steven crying] It's okay, it's okay. - Do you guys know them? - [Boy] Retards. - I'll be right back. - [Girl] Okay, see ya. - Hi, guys. I'm Jennifer. Can I sit with you? So what's your name? - I'm Philip. - My name is Steven. - That's 519 dollars. [Keyboard clacking] - Corrine. Do you recall my mentioning our audit today? I told you I needed your paperwork by noon. - I'm sorry, I had a family emergency. - Again? - Taylor, I promise-- - corrine, this isn't gonna work. I have to let you go. - Come on, Taylor, I've sold a lot of insurance for you-- - I can give you a month's sentence. - Please don't do this! - That's the best I can do. [Telephone ringing] Yes? No, that won't do, I need it by tomorrow. That's right. [Dramatic music] [Trunk bangs shut] - No, I'm afraid, yeah... - [Pa] May I have your attention please? If you are here for your scheduled interview with a ui representative, please have all of your documents ready when your name is called, thank you. - Check. Check. - [Kid] Wow. - Checkmate again. [Pawns clattering] That was checkmate. - Next. [Dog barking nearby] - Hello. Hey, um, who are you? - I'm Doug, how you do? - What are you doing in my driveway, Doug? - Your landlord, Mr. Merrick, said you got a busted water pipe, right? He sent me over to fix it. He said you were a ball-buster. - Did he? - Yes, ma'am, he did. Oh, you want me to move this? [Car door bangs shut] - Thanks. [Motor revving] [Van doors bang shut] - His eyes are swollen shut. - And Mickey says, "can you see what he's doing to you, kid?" - And rocky says, "i can't see nothin'." - So he yells, "open my eyes," which means they have to cut them to let the pressure out. - Cut his eyes? - He makes them do it. He doesn't care about the pain. He just wants to win and-- - hey, Jennifer. Are you the meat in a retard sandwich? - I am and you can bite me. - What are they doing? - That's the cross country team. They're running. Like rocky. [Dramatic music] [Crickets chirping] - We need 50 dollars for the chess club. - The chess club? - We joined. You always tell US we can do anything. - But I didn't know you liked chess. - We learned it last week. - You learned chess last week? - Philip beat this kid named ward. He's supposed to be the best. - That's amazing. Why didn't you tell me? - We don't tell you everything we do. - Like astronomy club and geography club, which we also joined, but they were free. - Well, it's probably time for you to do your homework. - I don't like homework. - But it's very important that you do it. - Why? - So you can get good grades and learn things and-- - go to college. - Yeah. You wanna go to college? - Yep, I wanna join the cross country team. I wanna run like rocky. - Fine. First you have to do your homework.

In a long time. - Philip has an audition for a music school tomorrow. I would love it if you would come with US. - I'll be there. Absolutely. I'd love it. - Good. - Hey, what time uh, do the boys get home? - The boys don't come home. They're spending the night with reva. - Good. Oh, my knees! [Corrine laughs] - That looks nice on you. - Thank you, I thought it suited me. Oh. Listen... Am I your first ditch digger? - No. That's good. [Dog barking nearby] Wish your brother good luck at his audition. - Good luck. - Mm-mm-mm. [Students chattering] - Could you hold the door? Thanks! - How you doing there, maestro? - Just play it like you do at home. - Good morning, Philip. [Doug sighs] What are you gonna play for US today? [Strumming guitar] [Strumming out of tune] - Would you like a few minutes to prepare? [Guitar case crashing] - Oh, oh, oh, it's all right, it's all right. - Hey, hey, hey, it's all right. - He's, he just learned, he can already... It's all right. Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay. [Philip crying] - He's uh, he's autistic. - Autistic? - He's a very high functioning autistic. Yeah. He's really, he, brilliant, I mean, is what he is. I mean, he's just amazing. - Oh, we don't doubt that, but. - Doug, Doug, Doug! Let's go. - Well... - Let's go. We're gonna go. Let's go, let's go, let's go. [Car door slams] - Mom, where is Steven? He's not home from school. - Stay here with him. - You don't want US to come with you? - No, stay, stay. [Motor revving] [Door bangs shut] [Tires pealing] Steven? Where have you been? - Mom, I joined the cross country team. - You what? - Uh, miss Morgan. I'm rich Wheeler, i'm Steven's coach. - Hi. You're his coach? - Yeah, he's a helluva runner, this guy. I was gonna give him a ride home, he said it'd be okay with you. - Oh, that's okay, I have my car. Um, thank you. - Oh, okay. Well, he's a good kid and he shows a lotta promise. - Thank you. - Are you mad at me? - [Sighs] No. - I was going to surprise you. - [Corrine] Well, you did. - Mr. Wheeler says I'm really good. - I'm sure you are, but you need to tell me when you do things like that, you know I worry. - I just wanted to do something on my own. You always do everything for US. - You have practice every night? - Yeah, till six. - And you're pretty fast, huh? [Birds chirping] [Whistling] - [Runner] Morgan, over here! - Where is Morgan? - Uh, I think he got lost again, coach. - Sorry. [Breathing heavily] - You tried, son. I mean, I admire your heart and your talent, but I just don't think you're ready to race. This getting lost all the time, it's a problem. - How'd it go? Everything okay? - Yeah. [Dog barking nearby] [Dramatic music] [Telephone beeping] [Telephone ringing] - That's okay. Hello? - This is Philip Morgan. I auditioned. Well, I had a bad episode. - Well, yes, it can be nerve wracking having to perform for strangers. - [Philip] Can I have another chance? - Another chance? Well, I don't see why not. - So I'm going to play a song. Will you listen to it? - Well, sure. [Playing guitar] Philip, are you there? Philip, did you really just start playing four weeks ago? - No, it'll be four weeks tomorrow. - Is your mom there? - Mom! Mom. - What? - This lady wants to talk to you. - Hello, who's this? He what? Okay. Sure. She wants to talk to you again. - [Philip] Okay. - My son just auditioned for the judge of the McKinley school over the phone. She said she's gonna let him attend on a trial basis. [Both laugh] - Wow! - I know! - That is so cool. [Corrine laughs] - I saw your truck out front. - Oh, Steven, you really should knock before entering a room. - I was wondering if Doug wanted to go for a run with me. - You better not slack off if you're running with me 'cause I am one finely tuned machine. Can you give me 10 minutes? Can you, uh, tune up my machine? - If you give me more than 10 minutes. - Hey! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! Slow down for the old man. Woo! You with the third lung. When's your race? - Friday. But the coach won't let me run. - What? What do you mean he won't let you run? Why? - I keep getting lost in the course. - Why don't you just follow the other runners? What's your coach's name? - Coach Wheeler. [Strumming guitar] - Hey, there, Superman. - Watch. - Wow! That's pretty impressive. I want you to know how proud I am of you. - For what? It's only 85 pounds. - It's a whole lot more than that. - Come on. Come on, don't slow, don't slow! All right, that's good, that's fantastic. You shaved two seconds off in one week. Stay focused on your rhythm. - You're pretty fast, Steve-O. So you guys got your first big race Friday, huh? - Yeah. Are you going to be there? - If you promise me to win. Okay. - All right, you guys ran hard today. Hit the showers. - All right. - And get some rest, I wanna win this weekend. - Hey, coach. - Hey, Mr. Thomas. Steven ran real well today. - Yeah, he did. You know, it would mean the world to him if he could compete on Friday. - Yeah, I'd like to see him do it, too, but he gets lost. - Yeah, he told me. Listen, I got an idea. [Bright music] [Stapler clicks] See? - You guys are sure late. - We had a little business to take care of. - Coach is gonna let me run and Jennifer's going to be there to watch me win. - You know girls, they go for athletes. - I know. - You know? What do you mean you know? - I don't know. - I'm so scared he's gonna be disappointed. - You gotta give him a little more credit than that. - He's just a little boy. - He's a 14 year old teenager, remember? Hey, what's up? [Corrine sighs] - [Steven] Dear Jennifer... This is a poem for you to let you know how much you mean to me. [School bell rings] [Upbeat music] - I don't see him. - Oh, he's probably getting himself psyched up. - Where is he, where is he, where is he? - Anybody see Morgan? - Sorry, coach. - All right, stretch it out. - Where is he? - All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you could take your seats, please, take your seats. Runners, 10 minutes to race time. 10 minutes, runners. - I'll be right back. - Where the heck is your boy? - I don't know, I don't know. [Shouting] Steven! Steven! - [Coach] Runners, five minutes. Five minutes to race time. [Crowd chattering] - Steven. What's the matter, sweetheart? Got the jitters? What you got there? Can I see it? That's a beautiful poem. Were you gonna give it to Jennifer? - I saw her with another boy. - Mm. Steven, in about two minutes your chance to show Jennifer and every other girl in school what an amazing runner you are will be over. - [Coach] Runners to the starting line. - Doug and Philip and I are all here to watch you run. Steven, I believe in you with all my heart and soul. I know you can do it, but it's your decision. I'll love you just as much no matter what you do. - [Coach] Runners, take your Mark! [Crowd cheering] All right, guys, let's go, let's go! [Doug sighs] Set! [Gun bangs] [Timer clicks] [Crowd cheers] [Upbeat music] - Hey! Go, Steven! Go! - I don't know what I got US into, but if it breaks his heart it's all on me. - Where'd you find him? [Thrilling music] - He's catching up! [Crowd cheering] - 7:40! 7:40! - Go Steven! - Come on, guys, kick it! Just one more lap! [Thrilling music] - There he is again. - Oh god, he's lost! [Upbeat music] - Lost, my ass. No wonder he couldn't just follow the other runners, he was always way ahead of them! [Laughs] [Upbeat music] [Crowd cheering] - [Corrine] Steven! [Corrine laughs] - Woo! - Ladies and gentlemen, number 22, Steven Morgan, has just set a new course record! [Crowd cheering] [Corrine laughs] [Crowd cheering] - [Woman] Ladies and gentlemen, Steven Morgan, who will speak on behalf of the miracle run foundation finding a cure for autism, which was founded by his mother, corrine. [Guests applauding] - My name is Steven. And my brother, Philip, and I are autistic. I am 15 years old and I have overcome many obstacles. My mother was told we would be in a institution for life, but she refused to accept this. In the past, I have had no friends. I didn't know exactly how to make any friends. I was very lonely. If it wasn't for the love of my mother, My brother and I would not be here tonight. [Guests applauding] ["Classical gas" by Mason Williams] [Dramatic music]
