It doesn't matter if the stories we're about to tell you are true. Consider them invented because you're seeing them on the screen. Consider them true because they happen everyday. Because everyday they fill the news. These stories are the exploits of the "burnt-out generation". The generation which were children during the war and when they opened their eyes, they saw only one thing in the world: the general mobilization of violence. The show was so impressive, so intrusive that it seemed to hide everything. Even kindness, generosity, sacrifice. But even so they flourished during those years as in others. Violence appeared triumphant. It went at a happy and sporty pace. It went as far as to feign a sort of juvenile innocence. Its law was to scorn every law. Its social characteristic was contempt for any society in the triumph of the audacious individual, cynical, devoid of remorse. When the burnt-out generation appeared in the news with a series of crimes, it was apparent that it wasn't delinquency which arises from poverty and social differences. The new heroes in the papers were youngsters from well off families, It wasn't need or a social inferiority complex which drove them to crime, but the desire to carry out exceptional deeds, to stand out, to feel like the star of a thriller, of comic-strips, of gangster films. War and crime news, comics and cinema, they melted into one ideal: the celebration of violence as a personal triumph. The only reason for spilling blood for them was to assert, in the sinister light of a cruel gesture, the victorious culture of self. When the hero in the papers becomes aware of his misery and he realises that he's lost the most useless battle, it's too late. Meanwhile the others contemplate his gesture magnified by the papers, they revere him and think about copying him. So the wretched circle begins again. For exactly the opposite purpose we're telling our stories. Three different stories, from three different countries. But basically all similar, in their sad reason. We won't adorn them in telling them, enriched with a charm they don't possess. We'll tell them without colouring them, without emphasis, so that you'll see their reality, which you'll watch without decoration, it's a squalid reality, unable to seduce anyone. Thank you, madam. Take them off, you don't wear patent shoes for the country. She only thinks about having fun, going out. In my day we thought about the home. That's why they found a husband. Where's she going today? To seduce Ali-Kan! They're going for a walk with the school. - Simone, are the other girls going too? - Yes! Hello? Mrs. Hiber? It's Mrs. Roger. Sorry to disturb, I'm Simone's mother. I wanted to ask you if Pauline is going on the walk with the class. Yes. - Have you seen my glasses? - No. That's right, they're still children. I wanted to be sure that the others were going too. Yes, me too... me too. I said at 8. Yes, okay. Goodbye, madam. I've got to go, are you coming? Coquelin is at home again today, I've got to open the shop. - He's a real "malingerer"! - Don't I know! Since Easter he's been ill at least... Are you coming down with us? - Where are you going? - To Virénes, they're coming to get me. - You must be home by 7! - Okay, at 7. I can't wait to do the morning shift again. Georges, do me a favour, go to Fournier and tell him I'll go up there Sunday morning or afternoon. You'll see what a place it is! The view is wonderful! If everything goes as I hope, I'll settle there. I've got a house, it's small, but it's got everything. I went to Virénes on day with Georges. One day! You have to live there to appreciate the beauty, the poetry! I know what poetry is! - Let's go. - Are you taking a snack? - No, if we get hungry, we can buy something there. - You'll pay triple the price. You're like my brother, the one that got the medal for the Dardanelli. Don't bore me with your brother and the Dardanelli! - He's dead. - But a brother doesn't leave his pension to his sister! - Did you see that? - That pig of a headmaster! - Is it a mistake? - It's nothing, mum. Don't worry. I told you I wasn't going to school yesterday. The history teacher wanted to cheat me with an oral test. It says here that you haven't been to school for a week. I picked up the post by chance, but if your father knew about this Well, tell him then! You youngsters, why are you doing this? It's your last year. It's in the wardrobe at the bottom, be quick. I won't tell Dad, but I'll go and speak to the headmaster. I'll ask to do an oral test tomorrow and that'll show him. Have you finished combing your hair? You're not Laurence Olivier, you know. Our programme has been calculated to the minute, we mustn't be late. - You take it. - No, it's for you, keep it. - Is Pierre going with you? - Yes. - Have you spoken to Pierre? - Simone spoke to him. - Really? - He assured her he was coming. - Repeat it properly or else no present. - Pierre is heading... - "He's heading for ..." - The spring. - And... - He needs 100 francs. Well done, off you go. It's no good your brother telling tales, I won't give him a penny. We're going on a trip, I need it for the tram, Coca-Cola... - Where? - To Virénes Castle. Georges says that there are some prisons which Luigi XI used. With my detective flair I'll discover some treasure. Tell your friend Georges that he's ignorant. When Virénes was built, Luigi XI had been dead for centuries. There aren't any prisons, it was a monastery. Leave the bag alone... Pierre, did you know your father's playing at the high school today? Sure, but if I don't go on the trip, the others won't go either. I 'phoned Simone to say I wouldn't go, but I didn't manage to. - And then concerts I... - And you boast about it? You've got a chance to educate yourself and admire your father. Héléne, don't make a fuss, I really don't want it. Marie-Claire, tell your brother to discover all the treasure he wants. - Gustavo, he must come! - I don't want him to. - You don't have to come either. - Are you mad? - If you don't come he'll be upset. - He doesn't care, you know him. Give me the money. Hurry up, Marie-Claire. Dad hopes you'll go a long way. Far away and you won't show up at the high school. I don't play boogie-woogie and that's the music you like. Where did you get this? - It's dad's. - Who said you could take it? Art! Put it back, you'll have time to take an interest in art. Take a pullover, it's cool in the evening. Héléne, if you want to come hurry up, they're sending the car for me. - May we... Pierre, where are you going? - There's the bus at Saint-Claude. We can take the girls first and then Pierre. No, it's too complicated, hurry up, I'm ready. - Pierre! - Yes? Here I am, Dad. What the devil is he doing? He should be here by now. - Weren't you supposed to meet him? - He had to go to the bank first. You should have tailed him. - What would you like? - I've no idea. - You can choose. - A scotch. - What? - A whisky, scotch. - Ah, whisky, if you don't say so... - A lemonade for me. He's not coming. There aren't any spies amongst us, are there? - If he doesn't come, we'll go anyway. - It's not strawberry season anymore. - What's the matter? - With what's about to happen! Nothing ever happens! Geneviéve, if you don't stop it, I'll slap you! And I'll tell Mum! You shouldn't have brought that snotty-nosed girl! She did the right thing, that way Pierre won't suspect anything. - So I've got a paralytic grandmother. - You could have lent her to us. Family! I can't stand it anymore! It's over now. Today's the 19th and the 22nd everyone leaves! Then we'll be free! That'll be the life! I've got an idea for the inauguration of our 'tabarin' in Algiers. You'll wear a red, tight fitting t-shirt and a big white beard. You're mad. I'll sing, I've already got my "repertoire". You don't know the Arabs, you'll have to pay in kind. I read in "France-Dimanche" that there's a plane which carries clandestine passengers. There was the fare: 900 for six people. - 900? - Thousand, stupid! - We'll have it. - Amateurs! - There. - Have you got any Camel, Paul? Pierre's coming. He could take us with the car, couldn't he? - Am I late? - Yes, shall we take your car? - No. - James has got to go to Marseilles. - There's the bus! - Let's go! Be careful, no stupid moves. We must discover what he's up to and what he means to do. Not just what he means to do... the facts. The letter for the alibi! You said you'd do it. - I will. - It must be very clear. - With the police... - Stop it, it'll be luminous. You get the tickets, I forget to change up. - How much have you got? - I never count money. - Have you done a deal? - I've always got cash, in case I go away... I'd like to get away to Panama. - Are you going to Algiers? - In 2 weeks we'll all be in Algiers. You've undertaken to pay the trip for us. Was it 900 thousand? - What's this all about? - When are you leaving? That's my business. I've had a deposit of 5 million, maybe soon. And us? You know we're ready to leave: Monday 22nd. - Bye, bye! - Aren't you coming with us? - No. - But you'll leave us the money? - That's unlikely. - I'm investing everything in raw diamonds. - Will you give me some? I've got a lot of expenses just now, I want to get rid of Lili. I'm fed up with her, but I'll have to pay her off well. Don't block the gangway. Sit down, you youngsters. - Did you hear that? - Are you surprised? Don't worry, we'll take him on a nice trip today. Does he keep the money in a bank or with Lili? We need a proxy. We'll get the proxy, but maybe he's got enough with him. Do you trust Simone? "Lili... to Pierre... my man." She's a perfect idiot, a real leech. But physically she's perfect! She's decided she wants to have my child. - Let her do it. - Then I'll have to maintain it for life! - That'll keep you busy. - I'm already busy enough! Women should learn to look after themselves. I'm so tired! Always the same old life! The same hotels, the same nights, the same things every night... They must be rather eventful nights. But she doesn't affect me, poor thing! I found out that she pays James to keep an eye on me. She made a real fuss because I came here. She even offered me 100 thousand francs to stay with her! She's hysterical. A woman of her age doesn't run after high school students. I don't need her money, I've got more than her. But I like it when she gets angry. This morning, half naked, uncombed, she was formidable. As far as experience goes... there aren't many women who can match her. What have you got in your pocket? A snack? I've brought some chocolate. Virénes! Georges, we're here. Genevieve! We get off at the next stop. - Will you stop at the level crossing? - Okay. - Georges, is this where you spend your holidays? - Yes. - Our house is down there. - It'll be boring staying here for 3 months. - A real torture. - It seems nice to me. - To death! - Which way do we go? - Geneviéve! - I don't want to get off. - Don't be an idiot! - I want to go to Algiers in the tabarin! - I've had enough of this girl! - Here's the train! Be careful, careful! It looks like a train from the Far West. - Let's see who arrives first! - Let's go! Come on, Simone. Hang gliding! It must be fun being up there! - Do you want to drive me mad? - Me? - Do you know what's at the bottom of my heart? - Yes, a vulcano. At your age boys have got a vulcano at the bottom of their heart. I wait like a begger for you to look at me. For you to come near me if only for a moment. I really need to kiss you. - Why have you always been glued to him? - Stop it, André. Have I got to write the letter for the alibi or console your heart? Sizi, you're so beautiful! I'm jealous of everyone that looks at you. Let them look, I like being looked at! - I'd like to be alone with you. - We will, don't worry, we will. André, I love you. But if they send me to college, we won't see each other again. Take me away! We'd have already left if Pierre hadn't fooled us. Six months of planning for nothing! - It's a shame we didn't pal up with Pierre. - He gave up on us. He's not stupid, all he earns is his and that's it! It's easy to earn like that. Whereas we're all together! Sizi, Monday 22nd, believe me. - Today I'm the one who decides. - We'll see. Lads, this way! Georges says it's quicker! Come on, we'll see the famous explorer Georges Ruy in flesh and blood, 3 times eaten by a lion, once married to Rita Hayworth and still alive! He'll drag us into a thrilling adventure! - Come on, doll. - Is it this way? - Come on, Paul. - I'm here. Hi! The gamekeeper's here as well! It's Fournier. Mr. Fournier, my father will come on Sunday. - Did he say so? - Yes. - Are you going for a walk? - Yes, a stroll in the wood. - Pay my respects to your mother. - I will. - What a whimperer! - What did you say? Nothing, it's American. What's the matter? Leave them alone. It's the springtime. Pierre! What are you doing? Here, take it. It's the homework for tomorrow, don't give it to André. Love makes you do this and more, but well... When Musset did George Sand's homework, - he never passed it on to Chopin. - Thanks, you're a darling. Why do you keep coming to school with all the deals you've got? It's useful for me, it's a screen. - I pay a graduate who does my homework. - You're incredible. Do you remember last year When you wrote that essay for me - which ended with a declaration of love? - Yes. I also remember your answer: "No deal". You gave up too soon. If you were really interested, you'd have been more persistent. - You were with André. - And you with Lili! - It's not the same thing, it's different. - It's still a love affair. - With André now... - He's a child. - He's a year older than me. - He's okay for a walk in the country. - Do you care for me a little? - Take me away. Take me away. It's not enough to make a good fire, get some more. - Then we can play at Joan of Arc. - Joan of Arc? - The one they burnt alive. - Why did they burn her? Because she was interested in politics. Do you want some as well? It's brandy. Really, it's very strong. I drink to the death of the traitor. - And so? - So what? Easy, when he comes, André and I'll take him with us. - Shall we wait for you here? - If necessary you'll help us, but later. - Maybe later. - Thanks, I won't bother. I bet Simone got him to give her the money. We're mad to leave them alone. Pierre could be all over her, ripping her clothes! - Forcing her to kiss him. - And then? Let's leave them to enjoy these last moments. In Russia condemned men have the right to a last girl. I saw it in a film with Cerkassov. Why've you always got that grave-digger's face? They think the ideal thing is for me to marry and have a savings book. If I didn't hate them so much, I'd find them funny. My father's worked all his life to become the owner of a shop. He can't even say he's worked honestly, because he steals! 2 inches of material a yard, idiot! He should steal millions, then it would be worth it! I want a brilliant life, I like American cars, money. Not for the money itself, but to be able to humiliate others! - To get drunk. - You can't get drunk every day. I want to live life my way and I'm willing to do anything to do it! - You're deluding yourself. - Why do you say that? In reality people steal and kill far less than you would think, fortunately. You're a fine one to talk! You who's got an adventurous and incredible life! That's why I love you, Pierre. Take me with you to Panama. I'll help you and if you want to keep Lili as well... that's okay. - I'm not a nun. - That's not the reason, the truth is... - Go on, tell me. - If I told you I... That you made your money playing "blindman's buff"? That you read fairy tales at night with Lili? - I haven't got any money and I haven't got any Lili. - Poor thing! - You're a good boy and at night you think about equations. - And about you. Stop it, I'm not stupid! I wish you'd love me as if I really was a good boy. - Just anyone. - Why? Because... of all my adventures, you're the only innocent one for me. School is you, Racine's heroines... it's always you. To the devil with Racine! I'm not innocent and I want to leave with you! I don't! I want you to stay the young girl who hasn't got enough money to go and see Gelin's latest film. It's over for me, but you, Simone, you've got your whole life ahead. Pierre! - You won't care about me anymore. - Anymore? You're probably right. Here's the money. - Will you do me a favour? - A thousand. It's silly, but my stupid parents think we're together. It's too complicated to explain. They know I care for you. Whenever I get home late, they bombard me with questions. The pleasure, the relish of humiliating me! Write me a letter. Not exactly a letter. Just a few lines will do, as you would when you make a sudden decision. For example... My dear Sizi, I'm leaving for America, I decided at the last minute. Forgive me. Well, whatever you want. I'll let them find the letter, they'll think it's all over between us. And for ever. Pierre! Pierre! - I don't want the others to know. - Trust me. Here we are! - I collected it all. - You demolished half the forest. - Almost. Maybe a bit less than half. You took a long time. Shall we get a move on? - We could do with some paper. - Get Pierre to give you some, - he lights a pipe with money! - We'll have a look around. You two go that way, I'll go this way. - Are you coming with us? - No, it's better like this. Let's go! André, come on. Have you got a cigarette? Are you doing this for me, André? Even if you can't see me, keep going straight on. André, you know the way. I don't understand why Georges is going away on his own. It's starting to get cool, isn't it? We'll catch a cold. There's the castle. Let's do a sprint, I'm feeling fit today. Do you remember the camp site at Charleroi? It rained so much that night! - Don't you write poetry anymore? - No, it was too easy. I need more. Much more. Does it bother you to talk about it? They were good, you should continue. They aren't "boring" like the ones by Victor Hugo. They're like Prévert's. You could be successful. Where's Georges got to? Does he always have to complicate everything? However.. I like being with you. I've never been here before. Geneviéve! Simone. Idiot! Good heavens! Stop! Stop! Somebody's hurt, will you help me? Quick! Georges, take the dog out for a walk. Hurry up. - Let's go, Toto. - Get some milk as well. - Did you hear? - Yes, I heard. Then the next time answer me. Hello. Yes? Can you call later? My husband's resting. He came home very tired, so... Yes, of course, we've got a small house at Virénes. - My son? Who is it? - Just a moment! There's an officer on the 'phone, he wants to know about Virénes. Hello, tell me. - Do you know a class mate of Georges called Pierre Vernis? - Of course. Yes, with my son? Where's Georges? Call him straight away, run! Just a minute, he's coming. I think there's been a mistake, anyway I'm here. Georges has gone downstairs. What's happened? Call him, I want to speak to Georges! Lets go, we've got to put the the revolver back. - What time did it happen? - At about 6. Where were you? - Have you got everything? - He only had counterfeit money, but even if it had been real, I wouldn't have taken it. I couldn't. It's over, it's all over now. It gave me a strange sensation. Georges, come here, your father wants to talk to you. You went to Virénes. this afternoon Yes. - Tell me the truth! - I swear not! It wasn't me! André, you tell him! Dad, he's the culprit. Tell him that you fired the shot! I didn't shoot! Dad, only he fired the gun! Is that the truth? You, alone? Let's go to the police station. Off we go. Come on, quick. You didn't do anything, go home. What is it? - A fire. - Yes, a fire. It's always the insurance that pays. I'd just fallen asleep, why do they sound like that at night? It's so sultry! The water's hot. Giulio, Claudio's not here. Did he tell you he was going out? - Who? - Claudio! - He said he was staying at home. - He must have changed his mind. But it's 4 o'clock! - Yes. - Where can he be at this hour? Maybe something's happened to him? He's so delicate! He isn't delicate, he's a hypocrite! I'm not deluding myself anymore. I'm starting to understand him. And he thinks that I don't know him. How untidy! I can't stand seeing his books like this. We'll have to get him another bookcase. There! Do you want to know where he is? Do you know her? Has he ever brought her home? Claudio never invites anyone, he's always invited everywhere. Exactly, he'll be at some party, lucky him. Well, he's very photogenic. I'm going back to bed. It might just be that fire which will keep me busy at the office tomorrow. I'm worried, he's never been so late before. Tomorrow I'll tell him. You should get used to it, he's not a child anymore. With all those tarts around! Let's hope he's okay! Jeep 35-95, received. - The boats coming. - We're leaving immediately! We're coming straight away. Over. Catch! Here they are. I'm going down. Since I've been dealing in cigarettes my wife doesn't smoke anymore! Customs! Stop! Stop! Customs, go! - Let me through. - No. - Let me through! - No. Gog Eugenio, Eugenio. At your service, madam. Did my son say where he was going? Did someone 'phone him? - Yes, Mr. Olivieri. - Who's that? - I don't know, but he often 'phones. - What's his first name? Calm down, it's not the first time he's been late. - Such terrible things happen! - What are you thinking of! Bianca, if you want we can go to the police station, to the hospitals. - It's never happened before! - It's happening today. Have you discovered anything about the girl in the photo? No. A certain Mr. Olivieri called him. And how do we find him? How come you don't know your son's friends? - They're probably university friends. - I see, I'll go to the police station. - I'll come with you. - No, I'll call you later after speaking to the inspector. Don't you feel well? Do you want me to call someone? He isn't in hospital, that's good news, isn't it? Don't worry, the inspector thinks the same as me. Anyway he'll send someone to the house. Yes, two officers. No, it's just a formality. So you can explain things better and give them all the names. The girl. The inspector was asking me if Claudio had had any disappointments. Yes, if he's argued with that girl. No, inspector, I said so too, my son wouldn't do anything stupid for some disappointment. We've never met the young lady personally, but it's just the same. I'll just pop into the office and then I'll come straight home, okay. - Thank you for your kindness. - Not at all. I'm happy to have been of help to a friend of the Honourable Valeri. Guard! You usually wait a day or two, he could have left Rome. My son would have let us know. Has he had any quarrels with his father? My husband told the inspector, nothing's happened. - Whose letters are these? - They're from school mates, friends. I don't understand why you're examining these papers. Claudio must have had an accident. - Does your son do any deals? - What nonsense! - He's just a lad, he's in the first year of university. - Thank you, madam. You, come here. - Where were you when you heard the shots? - In the factory. - Who was with you? - The others. - What time was it? - About 5 o'clock. - I've just come from the Valmauro's. - Later. That youngster, Claudio Valmauro... look what I've found. Play something more pathetic, Marina needs some atmosphere. Guys, let's telephone Claudio, otherwise we'll be ruined. - Fools! - Why, isn't it true? How funny you are! - But really, why hasn't he come? - He'll have found some blonde. Worse for him if he doesn't come. I don't care. - What's the matter? - If you want me to console you, I'm here. - Here he is, calm down. - He's playing the existentialist! Claudio! Your mother's been bombarding me with 'phone calls since this morning! She started at 8. - What did she say? - Your parents went to the police station. Where were you last night? What's that face for? - Can we go outside a moment? - You want me to leave everyone like this? Guys, make yourselves at home. - What's the matter? - Nothing. - Let's go. - This way. Marina Locatelli, on the third floor. - Is she at home? - Yes, she's having a party. I'll go with you. They're all excuses, what do you suppose has happened? I'm getting really angry! Please, do me the favour of not involving me in this. When your mother phoned I told her, what a voice she had! Do you think I'm wrong? Say so! You say you come to see me, and instead you're playing around. You're looking bad, and you're drunk as well. - Stop it, Marina. - You stop it! I'm fed up! I don't care if you've got others girls! Do what you want! But without a lot of drama or pathetic scenes. - You should say things to my face. - Please, Marina! There isn't anyone else. No one. I didn't think I cared so much about you. I didn't betray you, I'd have told you. But there's one thing you don't know. - Just one. - One? I don't know anything about you, not even if you care about me. It's the first time you've ever told me. I must go away. It'd be nice to go away together. To see far away places, leave when and if you want and return when you like. Life would be great like that. It's the only way to be happy. You need money, lots and immediately. Because I want to live life while I'm young. At 20! Not when I'm old. - Do you understand? - What are you saying? What's the matter with you? Have you argued with your parents? It happens, you'll make it up. They give you everything you want. Do you think my father gives me the money I've got? I earn it myself! It's not difficult, you know. I was "doing well". Very well! Another few months and I'd have asked you to come with me. I want to save myself anyway, you see? I don't feel guilty! Nobody has the right to take my freedom away! Should I give myself up? Spend years in prison. Why give everything up? I'd never be resigned to it. It drives me mad just thinking about it. Give up my youth! I've done everything to enjoy it! I still think I've got this right. Even now that I've killed a man! Yes, Marina, I've killed a man. Are you mad? What are you talking about? Let's go away, maybe we'll never see each other again. Claudio! I'm sorry. Do me a favour, let's get away from here. You won't be compromised. You know nothing, understand? You don't know anything. It's not true, Claudio. It's not possible. It's true, Marina. I shouldn't have told you anything. But I needed to tell someone. I don't feel any remorse, you know? It's as if it hadn't happened to me. If only I didn't feel so ill! It happened when I fell. What's the matter, what's happened to me? - How do you feel? - I don't know, I feel ill. Tell me how you feel. It could be serious, an internal wound. Claudio. Let's go to the doctor. What does it matter now? I'll take you to my doctor, don't be afraid. - Where are you going? - Dr. Bonanni. - Go to the emergency ward. Wait a minute, I'll be right back. - Can I help? - Dr. Bonanni, he should be on the emergency ward. - Who are you? - Tell him its Miss Marina. Tell Dr. Bonanni that Miss Marina is waiting to see him. - He'll be right here. - Thank you. It's him. - Madam, your son has come home. - Where is he? - In his room. How is he? Claudio! He's come back! - Please, Bianca, let me. - No, me! Calm down, this is something I must deal with. Good evening, inspector. My son's come home. I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you. I must ask your son to come with us to the police station. To the police station? Call a doctor, quick! "Commendatore", what's the doctor's number? It's unbelievable, you bring up a son day by day, he's close to you, and suddenly you find yourself face to face with a stranger, a rogue! Giulio! Giulio! What have they done to you? What have they done to you? Claudio, what have they done to you? Claudio, what have they done to you? If only one of our children, listening to our three stories, feels healed of the morbid fascination which cultivates within him too many false images, if anyone, perceiving the unveiled face of egoism, feels faith in human solidarity reviving within him, our work won't have been in vain.
