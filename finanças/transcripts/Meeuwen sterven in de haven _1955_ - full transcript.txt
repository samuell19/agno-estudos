You again! l've already told you. l can't help you. You can't go without papers. Have you got any papers yet? l'm tired. No papers, no name. That just leads to problems and l've got enough of those. Tell me, what have you been up to? Have you got any money? Money. Where would l get that? But l want to work. lf you think l'm too lazy to ... Water levels in the Rhine: Kaub 232, fall 8. Cologne 197, rise 12. Ruhrot 391 , rise 16. l can't silence the people at the border with your work. Those papers are just an excuse. You want money, eh? Papers and money, dear friend. Coming up is a request show with the motto: You request it, we play it. Hey, where are you going? Leave me in peace. Wonderful. Double the pleasure. Erna, are you coming? He's calling you. - A button's missing from your jacket. You hair's much too long. He doesn't bite, you know. - Why would he bite? There's nothing to be made from me. l've got to get out of here. Understand? l must get out of here. Let me talk to the captain. - You? l'll get him to take you. - What d'you want for doing it? Not money. Not papers. Erna, where are you? My ball! Thank you, sir. Will you play with me? Tomorrow. Tell me ... Are you all on your own? - My sister's over there. Play with me. Gigi? Where are you going? Aren't you playing anymore? Tomorrow. Naughty girl. Haven't you got any ears? l've called you three times. You must stay closer to me, understand? And don't talk to strangers again. Go home, quickly. When will that little nuisance stay home for a change? Staf, you know l can't come out without Gigi. They should've left her where she was. Why did your parents take on that child? And one that doesn't speak Flemish. lt won't have been out of charity. What do you know about it? What's the bet money behind it? - What d'you mean, money? Some fortune that's blocked, abroad, for example. When the money's unblocked they'll earn a nice little sum. Gigi is a war orphan and hasn't got any family anymore. Exactly. When the money's unblocked it goes to the foster parents. They wouldn't concern themselves with that child if there wasn't a pile of banknotes lying around somewhere. Meanwhile we're saddled with her. Do you really love that child? - Do you really love me? Have you got the Gigi disease, too? God, what a name, Gigi. lt's thanks to Gigi that l can be here every day. Admit it. All in all we can be grateful that she keeps quiet about it at home. l'm only sixteen and if father ... lt's time, Staf. Are you coming tomorrow? - Of course. With Gigi. Gigi. What are you doing? - Look, Daddy. Your man looks sad. D'you think so? Go inside. lt's too cold. lt's too windy. Will you draw me something? A man, laughing. Tomorrow. - lt's always tomorrow. Have you eaten already? - Yes, but draw ... Ask Yvonne. - She doesn't want to. No one does. Where's Yvonne? - Don't know. What are you doing here? l'm leaving. - What d'you mean, leaving? Off to bed, you. - No. My man. lf you're stubborn, you'll get a smack. - No. Still interested in me? Still no friendlier? l've spoken to the captain. Hey, l've spoken to the captain. l've done that five times already and it didn't help in the slightest. Does that bloke say anything other than money, papers? Erna, where are you? Erna, where are you? As if you care ... - All l care about is a boat. l wonder what happened to you. Where do you come from? Where do you live? Nowhere. l don't live anywhere, either. You've got the boat. - A boat isn't anywhere. To you, maybe. To me, it's salvation. To me ... - What did the captain say? Not much. He's angry because the freight hasn't arrived and sailing has to be delayed again, at least by a day or two. Two days is a long time. ln which to be picked up. ln which to get away. You've got so little confidence in me. l'll manage it, you can count on it. Without money and without papers. You're rather sure of yourself. l know the captain. - You seem to know men well. We won't get anywhere like this. lt just makes things more difficult. lt makes it worthwhile. - And if he finds out? And don't harbour any illusions about your captain. ln Basle the Rhine is so beautiful. Why is it so beautiful by the Rhine? Are you ready? Do you know my man? - No. He saved my ball. ln your bed. Have you been to the toilet? - Yes. l haven't been to the toilet. Have you been to the toilet or not? - No. Annoying child. Get on with it. ln bed. And l don't want to hear a sound. Where's my man? - What man? The one l drew. ls that it? Are we going again tomorrow? He's coming back to play with me. l want to play with him. With that tramp? No way. - You play with a boy. That's none of your business. Go on, go to sleep. l'll tell Mummy all about it. - Have you finished? Are we going tomorrow? - Of course, stupid child. Really? - We'll see. Yvonne, l'm thirsty. Higher. Higher. Again. What's your name? My name's Gigi. What's yours? l haven't got a name. Haven't you really got a name? Everyone's got a name. l'll give you a name. l'll call you ... Prince. Prince? l'm not rich. l haven't got anything. But you're very nice. Catch. Shall we play? Come on. Again. Go and get it. Can't you find it? My ball. Where's my ball? Stay here, Gigi. - l don't like the look of that bloke. Prince. That's it. You're never coming with me again. That's it for today, eh? - Sorry? Prince, Prince. What do you think? - Come on. Excuse me, Gigi. Are you coming, Gigi? D'you remember this? Not so fast. - Where did you get that from? He remembers it. - Who are you? What d'you want? Nervous, aren't you? Come on, we might as well sit down as stand up. Where did you get that ball? Make yourself comfortable. Cigarette? Do you like it? Yes. Calm down. Take it easy. Where's the child? - Go on, sit down. Problems? What d'you want? - Me, nothing. But you want to leave. That's none of your business. Are you so sure about that? l thought, maybe l could do that bloke a favour. Help him get out of the danger zone. Maybe with this. You know Gigi, don't you? l don't get you. Little girls like that are worth money. lf you keep your ears open you'll always find one where money's involved and money means freedom. Democracy. Money involved with Gigi? Money involved with Gigi. You just have to know. What do you know? - You're too nosey. Here, catch. lf you need me you'll find me. Remember, give me that little girl and l'll help you get away from here. lt's quite simple. Don't worry about anything. We take, we give something back and keep some for ourselves. That's business, you know. So long. A bag. A bag of chips. - Big or small? Small. Anything on them? - No. That's five francs, please. A 10 franc bag of chips and two francs of mayonnaise. Thank you, sir. Good evening. Don't bother. He hasn't got a penny. That won't help our profession. Damn. They call it suffering in silence. Ready for love from head to toe. Preferably with the head rather than the toe. Shall l make it wet again? A man without a woman is like an electric cushion without electricity. Can't do a thing with it. Give here, l'll hold it. Here, drink up. lt'll do you good. When the kettle boils you'll get a cup of coffee. Better, eh? Rest a bit, if you can. l know about your illness. lt's not only here, but here, isn't it? Troubles. ln my case it's in my feet. ln my shoes, in fact. Twenty centimetres. You need to be a real misogynist for that. The coffee. l'm ready for love from head to toe ... Why ... Why did you bring me here? lt's alright here, isn't it? Don't worry too much about the rest. Sooner or later you'll find a hole big enough to crawl through. Let's see what comes out of there. l needn't expect much from you. Coffee. Long ago, l suppose? Hmm, men wandering around. They start with a small blunder and end with a big one. They should've realised long ago that the game isn't worth the candle. l know all about it. About men, l mean. Too sugary. l'm not listening to that. There's the milk, here's the sugar. You're the difficult kind, eh? Think too much and don't know what to do with yourself. Too soft, can't stand the sight of blood and suddenly the fat's in the fire and there they stand, thunderstruck. They don't understand that they have destroyed themselves. How old are you, in fact? Sixty. - Not yet sixteen, l suppose? ln any case too young to die and too old to live. D'you know what it is to be skint, to go hungry? Only come out when it's dark. Sleep on straw, not even a roof above my head that doesn't leak. Unable to see a way out, no one to help you. Alone among people. - l do know. Hunted like a dog. D'you know what it's like to be sixty? Your coffee's getting cold. Drink up. lt'll do you good. lt's raining again. lt's always raining. lt rained yesterday. lt rained then. lt rained then in Germany. Labour camp. lt rained. And l thought about my wife. About Denise. Come on, try to sleep. Sleep. Letting off a final round? None of my business, l suppose? Don't forget our business. Ah, awake already? Things not going well? All work, no play makes Jack a dull boy. - The first signs of old age. Correct. l feel sixty. - Wrong move. Otherwise l'd have to sack you and you are still far too presentable for that. Besides, l'll make you twenty again if l have to. Leave me alone, l'm not asking anything of you, am l? So, the young lady is touchy, too. Leave me alone. You don't need to look for anything because there isn't anything. Nothing. Nothing. l need money. We can do without tramps here. Or are you going to turn this place into a charity? Remember this. You haven't got time for love. D'you know that bloke? What bloke? - Don't pretend you don't know. The one who just went down the stairs, William the Silent. l know him and maybe l can do something you can't. Make money out of him. Did he reveal anything? What should he reveal? Why to me? What do you know about him? A lot of things. My ball. Where did you find it? Where did you lose it? Let's play. Let's play. Throw it. Again. What are you looking for? Are you tired? Me? No. l am. My man. Your man? - Yes. lt's you, Prince. l look sad. D'you think so? - Yes. How can we make him laugh? l know. Just a minute. See? There. Now he's happy. This one's happy but the other one isn't. ls the one who's laughing also Prince? - Actually, it's the same person. Can you be both sad and happy? - Maybe you can, maybe you can't. We're never completely happy or completely sad. The one that's laughing isn't you? lt used to be. But it's a long story. - A sad story, then. lt's a fairy tale, a fairy tale for grown-ups. Tell me. l love stories. Tell me. lt was a long time ago. lt was a long time ago. Tell me. OK. Just for you. What's the matter? What l said. A lot of things. A lot of things. l couldn't care less about the sordid things you get up to. Sordid things, eh? Nowhere near, girl. lf you think that's what l mean. l'll help that bloke out of his scrape. That surprises you, doesn't it? Never heard of some idiot who wants to leave the country, well, has to? Or otherwise he'll end up in the can sooner or later. l'm talking to you. You know about it, don't you? What do you know what l know? Awkward, eh? Not knowing what you can say and what you have to keep quiet. Got any cigarettes? - No. Are you going or am l? Heads, you go, tails, l go. Tails. As for your protege, forget it. l'll protect him. And yourself at the same time? - Yes, what did you expect? ls that the princess? Yes. They got married. But they didn't live happily ever after. Did they live happily? No one has ever told me such a lovely story before. They didn't live together for long. They weren't happy. A stupid war occurred. And with the war came the foreigners, who took the prince with them to a distant country. The princess remained behind all on her own. Many years later the liberators came. There were celebrations everywhere. But the liberators were young and strong, in the flush of victory. They enchanted the princess and made her forget the prince and everything that had joined them together. Now there was peace everywhere the prince also came back one day. But no matter how he begged, his sorrow was to no avail. The princess was and remained enchanted. The prince didn't know any spells that could save the princess. And he became sad. Very sad. And then he became angry. So angry that he put the princess into a deep sleep for ever. But the people got angry with him. So angry he had to flee for his life. And he's still fleeing. So it's a sad story, because you're crying. l don't want you to cry. You're very nice to me. Can l stay with you? lt's dirty here. What's this? ls it something to eat? Can l light it? Hey, wait a moment. Just a moment. Not so fast. Did you come for ... Or have you done it? Have you got her? No. Tomorrow. - But ... l said tomorrow. ls that all you've got to say? - Same time. ls that why you came here? Where is she, then? l don't know. Why did you leave me on my own? You've got to go home. Your mother will be worried, so will your sister. No, they don't love me at home. l'm staying here with you. - You can't. You have to go home. l've got to leave. l can't take you with me. Be good. l'll come and see you tomorrow and we'll play with the ball, OK? Come on. Come with me. l'm staying here. l'm staying here. Who's gone? - Gigi. That bothersome kid, again. - Now everything will come out. Let it. We're not children anymore. What shall l do? - Wait until she's back. ls that all you can say? - Do you want me to go and look? Would that bloke have taken her? - You watch too many films. The skipper? - Not here. Where to? - What does a woman know about a man? They go off and say nothing. You're just in time. We're leaving soon. You've got to help me, hide me. - Why have l got to hide you? Everything is OK. You can come. You should use your common sense. All that kissing is no good to anyone. Do what you should do. You should've taken better care of Gigi. lf anything happens it's your fault. What did that bloke look like? l've got to go somewhere quickly. l can't leave her there like that. Her? - Gigi. Are you one of those? - She's a six-year-old child. Prince, Prince. Prince, Prince. We're leaving in five minutes. You and your sweetheart can't have a minute longer.
