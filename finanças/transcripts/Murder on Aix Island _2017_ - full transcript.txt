SHROUDED IN MYSTERY Serge. Call the CROSS lifeguards. He's dead. Tell them to call the police. Dead body in a dinghy registration LRF23357. I repeat. Dead body. We're towing the dinghy back. Send the authorities. Confirm. Roger, patrol boat STLS288 Cross CTL. Authorised to come back to base. Thank you, gentlemen. Not too hard? Gérard, come on. The registration's the same as the annex of the fort. Check with them what they've got to say. Right. - Hello. Captain Brach. - Hello. Mayor Vincent Tessier. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Our client died between midnight and 2AM. Contusions all over, bruises on the face. And a violent knock at the back of the head. Yeah. It's not a suicide. No. His body's covered in tattoos, like the prisoners do. Can you tell us if you know him? Do I really have to? Yes. We'll gain some precious time Alright. Bring the stretcher. This jewel was hanging on the starting lever. It's a ruby? It's probably a garnet. The setting is old and carved. The true jewel of a witch. You OK? I'd rather meet with the living. I'd have liked to help you, but I don't know him. And this jewel? No. Not that either. No one recognises our client. Mr Mayor, my deputy. Nice to meet you. What's next? Let's go to the fort. You've got the keys, Sir? Yes. You know Aix island? I came once a long time ago. There we are. The guardian and the victim are the same person. José Chébèque. Born on Aix island... 48 years ago. José Chébèque? - That name's familiar? - Yes, it is. We went to the same school. I thought he was in prison. Well, he's out. What did he do? José and another bloke, Michel, killed a diamond dealer to steal his stones. They shot him down. When escaping, they killed a gendarme. Michel disappeared with the stones, leaving his family behind. And José was arrested. He was severely sentenced. Michel showed up after that? Not that I know of. José Chébèque had family here? No. He was brought up by his grand-parents, but they've left. Ask my dad. He knows everything about the island. Yes. Because your knowledge... "I don't know that man", you said. You're always so sure of your mistakes? You showed me a corpse. I didn't recognize him. A man can change in 20 years. That's yet to be proven. So, José Chébèque, released 2 months ago, after a 20-year sentence for armed robbery. and homicide. He'd stopped messing around. It's strange to bury oneself after 20 years in the cells. The search is almost over. There's only one access to the fort. No break-in. But they found blood in the main staircase and on the steps leading to the wharf. We can suppose he died on the spot and that his body was moved. Any mobile phone? - No. - Find the number and get it to be located. We're done here. Let's go home. Shall we drive you back? No. From now on, our home is Aix island. The police's only open in the summer. So, we're taking advantage to do some works. I can't ask to remove everything. Well, at least, we have a cell. Yeah. What's that big building at the back? The city hall. Council Room There we are. It's... It's perfect. No, but it's... It's big enough for my team. Can we make some room? No, it's the municipal council room. This is my office with confidential documents. - "Confidential documents"? - Yes. Confidential documents. Yes. It's the archives of the credit union that contribute to the economic and social development of Aix. I'm the director, besides my role as mayor. Vincent. Can I call you Vincent? There's been a murder and I'll find the culprit. It's for public good that we should find him, right? Of course. In order to do so, I need a hand. Since Napoleon, a mayor is entitled to act as a police officer. The inhabitants trust you. The administrative tasks of the island can wait. No. Well... Maybe. But... Of course. So, we agree. You'll be my deputy. I'll inform the prosecutor. You're at the disposal of the investigation and kept to total confidentiality. Adrien, find a guy and put these confidential boxes in a safe place. Wait... I mean... Tell your father we're on our way. Please. My father got up the credit union. The island and its inhabitants are his life. He stays right here. He had some health problems. Luckily, I live next door. Oh, gosh. I was certain... Ah, there it is! There. Come and see. Now... The Chébèques. Chébèque. Ah! There. The Chébèques. The old man was severe when he caught us in his orchard. - You know where to find them? - Definitely. They've got a nice little tomb at Rochefort cemetery. A well-deserved rest, because after the trial, life had become hard. José gave them hell. Who's that? Melusina. A fairy who was cursed to live away from her family. People say she was the one who created Aix island. She'd have flooded the lands that linked the island to the continent. What stone is it? A gemstone. A garnet. A source of power and a pledge of eternal fidelity. Have you ever seen anyone wearing this jewel? No. Mr Tessier, do you know what made José come back? No idea. I'll show you out? Adrien, did you check for cameras? Yes. There are 2. One on the semaphore and one on the port. Plus those of the museums and shops. Let's pull out the archives about the diamond robbery. Check everything about Chébèque: relations, family, bank account. Everything since he's out. The list of visitors he saw in prison. What about the mobile phone? Nothing. If it's fallen in the water, it's going to be tricky to locate it. Michel Guyard, José's accomplice who vamoosed, he's got a wife and child. Are they still here? Yes. Aline and her son Mathieu live in the village. You saw him. He was one of the lifeguards. Where can we find Aline? She works 2 doors away from here. Shall we? You're still here? You'll be behind with your work. Crazy! - What's he doing here? - It's his 2nd house. My grandfather started the mother-of-pearl workshop. You never wanted to take over? I'm allergic to dust. These dolls were made by my mum. She worked here all her life. The assembling was done by the women, in winter. It helped them get through. - Is it true José's dead? - Yes. I was expecting my son when it happened. I was living with Michel. He and José were working on cargos. They'd leave for months. Michel hated that. He never managed to be away for long. We had nice projects, back then. A holiday resort by the fort de la Rade. But the banks refused to help us. It all went so fast. I felt José was dragging him into something. You didn't know? I was at the maternity when it happened. A CCTV filmed it all. José was holding the gun. It's he who shot the man at close range. But since he got caught, he said that Michel had run away with the diamonds. I was under shock. It took me some time to admit he wouldn't come back. He never showed up in 20 years? Look at this. This stone rings a bell? No. Not at all. When was the last time you saw José? Before the robbery. When they came back, I was in the maternity. This is exactly where José was arrested. The gendarmes had tracked them. José shot one of them right here, before he got caught. All this is the past. Coming? Come on, guys. Let's move it. Take all the hearing statements, please. OK. I've got them. I was going to call you. They're done at the fort. It's empty. The patrol boat has gone to get them. We're leaving on the next ferry in 11 minutes. Perfect. See you tomorrow. What? The police quarters are not yet ready. And all the hotels are closed. I'll sleep on the beach. You can go to Rose's. She rents out rooms. Then I'm staying, too. No. You go to Rochefort for the autopsy. Know what? Pick up some things for me at my place. Careful with the cat. It hates men. Don't worry, boy. The mayor's here if there's any problem. - So, let's go to Rose's? - "Let's go to Rose's." Rose's café is well renowned on the island. Just like the boss, you'll see. She lives with her son. Her husband died 30 years ago. It can't be true. There you are. Thanks. 1 shandy, 1 half pint. Hi everybody. Hi, guys. You OK? - Rose. - Tell me. Hello, Rose. She needs a room. I think we're full. "Full"? In this period? That's wonderful. The council will reconsider the allotment you're granted. I'd better go and check. Yes. Go and check. So, sir, you're going sightseeing with your new friends? Besides old fogeys at the bar, there's nothing much to see here. A refill, please. Enough for you. It's over. Piss off godfather. Mathieu, we've all had a hard day. - Go home. - What? Inspector Gadget can't stand us drinks? No? Then get lost. Bloody hell. Let go of me. Dammit! Let go of me! - Stop it! Shit! - Who the hell are you? Who do you think you are? You're not my father! You're not my father. Piss off. - What's happening? - It's OK. I managed to find you a room. I don't want to see that little jerk anymore. Excuse me. Shall we? This way. There. It's the same key for the main door. - There you are. - Thanks. You can have your meals at the restaurant. We're open everyday. What do you think about José's death? Me? Nothing at all. What did he come back for? - He had nothing left here. - Why nothing? José was born here. The island always calls its children back. Eveyone knows that. I have to go to the kitchen. - How was it? - Fine. Thanks. Mr Lentier, can you take a seat, please? You prefer a summons? I'm not here to make trouble. Thanks for what you did earlier. Mathieu's young. When he drinks too much, he loses it. And discovering a corpse is not joke for anybody. You're a fireman, you help your mother here, and you're the postman on the island. And also, a volunteer at the SNCM. That's a lot, isn't it? Helping one another is a question of survival. Oh, I was wondering if it was hard to moor at the fort? Well... We must just watch the swell. When the fort was abandoned, things were different. - Alright. Yeah. Could you tell me more? Well... Before the platform was built, we couldn't moor a boat. We got there swimming. We had to watch out for whirlpools. And José, he did it, too? We all did it. What kind of boy was he? A daredevil. The girls liked him. You didn't recognise him at the port this morning. No. Why's that? I was too far. You never thought of leaving the island to... build a family? All that I love is here. Why go elsewhere? - Bye. - Bye. Have a nice evening. - Hello. - Hello. I'd like to know who these people are. Come in. The girl is Aline. Bernard, José and Michel. That's what I thought. See the jewel around her neck? Yes. - We're going to her place. - What? Now? Yes. Now. Let me change, right? - Why not. Thanks. Hi. Who are you? - Solène. - OK. Solène. Tell my dad I'll come back late. Thanks. There. I'm ready. Your daughter'll come back late. Agathe? Ah, she didn't say her name. - You've got many? - Oh no! It was Agathe. You live alone with her? Yes. Since her mother went back to Argentina. - Coming? - Yes. - See you later, Mum. - OK, honey. Surprisingly, there's quite some night activity on the island. I'd lost this jewel. I completely forgot about it. Where were you the night José Chébèque was killed? At home. Outings are limited over here. Can anybody confirm? Your son? Oh, right! You're suspecting me of killing José? Can anybody confirm? Mathieu came home late, but he can. He knew José? Mathieu was born when José was arrested. That stone wasn't there by chance. Someone wanted to leave a message. For who would you say? When Michel left you, you stayed alone? Isn't it allowed? Mrs Ferrus, you maintain you've never met José again? OK. Let's go now. Thanks, Aline. You know your silence won't satisfy me. Good night, Mrs Ferrus. We'll set up a surveillance. It would be perfect here. You know the owners? They're on the mainland and rent out for holidays. - Their daughter has the keys. - Does she live far? No. Oh no! No way. Not tonight. - Oh yes! - No, we can't do that. Oh yes, we can! OK. After all, I might take a liking to it. - Take a liking to what? - Martyrize my colleagues. Thanks, Vincent. Someone will take over tomorrow. What can you tell me about Aline? She lived with her mother in the north of the island. Like Mathieu, she never knew her father. When she was small she said she was a pirate's daughter. Many stories went about. Not always very nice. And then, her mother died last year, and her house was destroyed in an arson. Hold on. Just a second. Adrien, did I wake you up? OK. Can you note down? A fire that destroyed the house of the mother of Aline Ferrus, about 1 year ago. Find the file and make a copy. That's all. OK. Er... Good night. Aline killing José, that's too farfetched for me. How would she have dragged the body to the boat? Not alone, but with an accomplice. Mathieu's an oyster farmer. He has a boat. This boy grew up with the idea his father was a coward. He's got reason to be angry. Room service. Coffee, croissant. Thanks. You'll sign it for me? Sorry? Yes. It's... It was to help me stay awake. Come and see. He stayed more than 20 min. They're lovers? - You laughing? - They're not lovers. If Bernard were her lover, we'd know about it. He's really not a womaniser. "Not a womaniser." What do you know? Whether they're lovers or not, they're very close. He's Mathieu's godfather. Bernard supported Aline, after the robbery. - Michel was a brother to him. - That's just it. The result of the autopsy: José died owing to a fracture of the cervicals. The forensics analysed the traces at the fort. José fought with his murderer and they hope to find DNA. Let's recap: no breaking into the place. The fort was closed. That means the victim let him in. The murderer came and went with his own means. The sea was still and the night was dark. Ideal conditions to go unnoticed. Oh, an article found in José's stuff. "Auction of the treasure of the monks." - "1998." - Seeing how old it is, José certainly kept it for a reason. "Several hundreds of gold guilders from the 900s." - They're worth a fortune. - 1 million euros. My father was directing the excavation, when they discovered the pot full of gilders. The monks probably hid the treasure when the island was invaded in the 900s. My father gifted his share to the city. The sale built up the capital of the credit union. Why was José Chébèque interested in this story? I'll go and check the police quarters. Oh, by the way. I went to your place. It was a tricky with the cat. And between sexy and bland, I chose the bland ones. OK. Thanks, Adrien. Captain, this is Patrick Fortin. You'll like what he has to say. Hello. A sailor saw you fighting with Chébèque right before he died. And you say you didn't know him? I got into words with a guy who had moored his boat to my buoy. I didn't know it was José. We asked for the prison register. Your signature's on it. You didn't know it was José you went to see? You came home late the night of the murder. Where were you? It's 3:05 pm. Mr Ferrus, you are taken into custody in view of the investigation of the murder of Chébèque. Read him his rights, take a DNA sample and keep him away. My tractor. The tide's rising. We'll take care of it. You'll find this interesting. - Sir. No. - Let me go in. What's this mess? Aline's not a criminal. - Stop it, Dad. It's Mathieu. - Same thing. What are you doing with them? It's our business. It's nobody else's. If I'm arrested, what will you do? Why would you be arrested? You're no murderer. - Dad. - What? Why would José have been interested in the monks' treasure? The monks' treasure? How would I know? These four were very close. Look. Aline's wearing the jewel on all the photos. The best part is this: love letters. The last one dates back to 15 years ago. They're all from abroad, from Michel. What are you doing in my house? What right... Please, madam. This is a police investigation, authorised by the DPP. Your son's been taken into custody for his presumed role in the murder. You're wrong. It can't be Mathieu. Mrs Ferrus, it's time you spoke up. Why are you after her? She's already so sad. Right. And you, you're not stopping them. Sir, please come out. The 1st letter came many months after he left. I was alone with Mathieu. I was in total despair. Michel wrote that he was coming back. I held onto that hope like mad. The weeks and months went by with no news. Then I received another letter. Full of words of love. But without any address. Nor return date. I started to hope again, face people. Then again, months passed with no news. The 3rd letter... was like an electroshock. It was exactly the same words. That's when I understood he'd never come back. Why didn't you leave the island, to start a new life? Maybe a part of me was still hoping. And I had to pull through for my son and myself. Back then, I was working at the workshop, at André's. I told him about my idea of a museum. He trusted me. I got a loan from the credit union. I never told Mathieu about these letters. To preserve him. In none of the letters has Michel mentioned him. It's ridiculous to accuse Mathieu. He didn't know José. Why would he kill him? I was hoping you would tell me. He saw José in prison 6 months ago. And witnesses saw them fight the eve of his death. No. it can't be true. Mathieu might have gone to the fort that evening. You told me: "He came home late." Things might have gone wrong. No. you're talking rubbish. Mathieu has nothing to do with this story. The garnet. I offered it to Michel 20 years ago, as a sign of love. It's Michel who had it and nobody else. Understand what it means? Michel has come back. Promise to call me if Michel contacts you. Promise. - Can I see my son? - Not for the moment. - Incredible. - How crazy! Mathieu's in the classroom. But he won't say a word. He doesn't want a lawyer. Michel's letters to Aline, 18 years ago. "Your absence is gnawing at me... "Food has lost its flavour, the sun is burning me, "I'm drowning in my thoughts of you, "the days go by and you stay in me." - They're all like that? - Yes. I understand why she got tired. I find it rather touching. You're very romantic, actually. Send this to the lab for analysis. If he killed José, he must be far by now. He's not done. The stone by the body is for Aline. She's the key to it all. - We'll wiretap her. - Go ahead. He'll certainly contact her. - Miss. - Let me pass. Agathe. Calm down. What's wrong? Dad, you must stop them. Mathieu's innocent. I promise you. Come with me. Mathieu was me that night. We're dating for the past 6 months. He didn't say anything because he wanted to protect me. He asked you to say that? He's fooling you. - It's the truth. - He's not a boy for you. - You think so. - Stop it! I'm pregnant. Yeah. I'm pregnant by Mathieu. Hey! Bastard. You bastard! Dad! Stop it! You won't get away! It's OK, my love, I told them we were together. - I also said... - I heard. Renaud, take care of Miss Tessier. Come on. Why did you go and see José in prison? To find my bloody father. I saw the letters he wrote to my mother. José promised to help me. - He didn't keep to his word? - Not one bit. That fucker fooled me well and truly. He knew where Michel was. But once he came out of prison, he avoided me. That's why we fought. And I nearly got him. I was so close. And then, you went to the fort? No. I tried to moor, but he never opened up. I didn't kill José. That evening I was in the house near the moats. That's where Agathe and I meet. Agathe. Agathe! I've never raised my hand on her. Come in. I couldn't understand her bad marks. What an idiot! A real idiot! I didn't see a thing. - She's still a little girl. - No. She's a young woman now whose is brave and down to earth. It's hard to tell one's parents what they don't want to hear. I feel I'm her enemy. You're here. That's what counts. She'll realise it, sooner or later. Yeah. There. Thanks. How did you meet her mother? Well, the usual stuff, you know. Summer on the island. We're young and beautiful. All's well. It's sunny. But winter comes back and the hard reality too. That's it. Rose just delivered her chowder. As usual, there's plenty for you and Agathe. I doubt Agathe's going to eat tonight. Care for some chowder? Eat up instead of thinking. I'll tell you something. God made women's bodies so they can bear children at 18, not 40. Oh, dad. Have any children? No. A police captain gives no room for suitors. And at almost 40, it's too late. There's fruit for dessert. There's also some yoghurt. Why are you after my son? Sorry? You're hanging around him. Think I'm seducing him? Maybe, yes. He's single. He's got a good situation. Just need to put your hand on him. "A good situation"? Don't worry. Your son's not my type. There's yogurt and fruit. Right. I'm going to bed. Yoghurt's not for me. - Night, Dad. - Yes. Good night. - Thanks. - I'm off, too. It was delicious. Very nice chowder. See you tomorrow. Wait. Do you have a minute? I'd like to show you a photo. This is me when I was 20. And... that young girl looks like you. Really! The one who's looking at you lovingly? Yes. If it were me, I'd remember. Good night. Morning. You don't seem in good shape. The chowder was too heavy? The islanders see me as a traitor, Agathe's pregnant for a murderer, and she wants to meet her mother in Argentina. Where is she? Can I talk to her? No. No, she's doing some cleaning work for pocket money. I don't think you could talk to her. You're the one who jailed up Mathieu. If Agathe said the truth, we'd know it very fast. Not going to the city hall? I'm going to check on the works at the water treatment plant. May I? May I take my morning off? I'm going to miss you, you know. Thanks for coming. I can't give you the mail of one of the inhabitants. But I can ask for rogatory letters, and then, we'll be controlling all the mail. Thanks. See you tomorrow. So, what news? The DNA we found is not Mathieu's. Bu there are enough similarities for it to be a relative. His father, for instance. Michel has no record. He's on the run. How to get his DNA? Mr Debasson's dead. He was killed. Who's that? An old man. His house is next to the beach. I do cleaning for him. OK. Easy. Sit down. - Tell me. - Well... As soon as I entered I got that smell, and... and he was there, tied up to the chair. Can you take us there? - Yeah? - Yeah. Let's go. Come on. Both of you, come along. Go ahead. We're already there. Meet us up. No, no. You stay here. Your father's coming. Fred, stay with the girl. Fifi, go around. Margaux, come. No one. A window's broken at the back. Nice evening by the fireplace. What do you say? I think it was a good beating up. And from the smell, it's many days ago. Let's wait for the forensics. Secure the area. I don't want any islander around. I'm fed up of prying eyes. I don't want any inquisitiveness. What do you know about this Debasson? He settled down here about 15 years ago, when he retired. He was an auctioneer. He'd sold the gilders of the monks. - Any family? - He was divorced. He'd bought the house for his children, for the summer. The neighbours got into words with my dad. He's the one who signed the permission. Is it the same one who murdered José? 2 violent murders in 3 days, that's food for thought. I was there when José and Mathieu had a fight. I even thought it was owing to me. Tell me. What happened? Well, last week, last Wednesday, I was alone, waiting for the ferry. José told me he was the guardian at the fort, that Mathieu's father wanted to see me. - Mathieu's father? - Yep. And he could take me by boat to him. Mathieu is obsessed by finding his father and was convinced he was at the fort. So, I didn't hesitate. I was going to get on board when Mathieu came. José was pushing me on board but I was holding back. So, they started to fight, but José managed to get away. He got on his boat and whizzed off. Nothing more these last years? 2 clients in 3 days. I must set up my business here. He died of haemorrhage owing to the blows at the liver. It's yet to be confirmed. We're taking him. - OK. Keep me posted? - Yep. What do we know about him? Mr Debasson had a police record. He served a 10-year sentence for traffic and laundering. He was still in charge of auctions? He retired hurriedly. He'd stopped all business. Any prints? Traces? Nothing we can use for now. The guy wore gloves. Well, if we can so. Come and see. This is strange. Call the editor, have him send you a copy. The murderer would have torn it off? Everything's against him, here. That's right. Incredible. You've won another return ticket to the morgue. Don't thank me. It's my pleasure. Mathieu wouldn't be able to do such a thing! That's the excuse to get him away from me? Make him a murderer? Mathieu is hot tempered. I'm not the only one who says so. You're too stupid. I'm leaving! I'll deal with her. Agathe! Agathe, wait for me. Agathe! Listen to me. It's normal you want to leave, but time will pass and you'll think about the others. Your father's worried about you. That's his job. That's how it is. And Mathieu needs you here, not in Buenos Aires. He doesn't want this child. I saw it in his eyes. Then I don't want it either. Mathieu is in custody, suspected for murder. It wasn't the best moment to let him know. Don't make a mistake by deciding by yourself. Otherwise, that'll be the end of your story. No need to be a shrink to realise it's complicated for Mathieu. His father left and ignored him. For me, it's my mother. It's a good balance. You really intended to meet her up in Argentina? No. That's how I see how much dad cares for me. I can't help it. I must take you back. I must take your deposition. - OK. Thanks, Agathe. Why did Michel want to see Agathe? No idea. You can thank Mathieu. He stopped her from going with José. OK. Everybody. We've got 2 victims. There's a link. Debasson was in charge of the sale of the monks' treasure. As for the robbery committed by José and Michel, the stones can't be tracked. The auctioneer was condemned for dealing and laundering. Michel never escaped abroad? He pretended to. Michel is now the main suspect for both murders. I'm sending out a national wanted notice. I'll look through the CCTV videos. I'll call the DPP. We'll need backup. Mathieu Ferrus, this is the end of your custody. You are not to leave the island without authorisation. I find it hard to admit there's a murderer on the island. He's not striking randomly. We must be the first to find what he's looking for. - You like that. - Sorry? Running after murderers and robbers. I guess so. I'm sure it was you. It was me? On the photo, that summer, it was you, right? I recognised you at the hideout. You were drawing me. I was asleep, I was vulnerable, and you took advantage to project on me your unconscious desire. You said you'd already been here. What does it take to admit it? What did that girl mean to you? She was just another one? Oh no! I still feel emotional. Ah, you do know to speak to women. - So what? - Oh! We'd spent a wonderful day, sailing, and one night making love under the stars. Did you try to get in touch with her? No. I was afraid I might spoil everything, and the memory of that day was enough for me. That's a selfish point of view. Yep. Yep, it's selfish but mutual. She didn't try to call me either. She might have had a reason not make the 1st step. - Is it? - Yes! Your hair was shorter, And I loved to watch the nape of your neck. The power of imagination. Well, Mr Mayor, mind your manners! That teenager with loving eyes has grown up, and you're not that 20-year old boy, running in the waves. And I'm not your type, I got it. Actually, you requisitioned me to punish me for my silence. I'm mayor and director of the credit union. So, I've got my own work. Do it yourself. Dammit. Yes? A message. When? Oh, OK. I'm on my way. Please. Hello, Mrs Ferrus. Hello. Michel left you a message asking you to meet him? Give me your jacket, your cap. I'm going. You've tapped my phone? He's dangerous. Leave it to us. - Hey! - I can also charge you with obstruction. Thank you. You can go back home now. Right. The lighthouse is surrounded by moats. The entrance is guarded. If he's there, he can't escape. Don't be over-zealous. Stop! Police. Dammit! OK, boss? Nothing broken? No. Well, yes. My self-esteem. Ask the coastguards to close off the island. All boats going out must be searched. - OK. Fine. - Go. You didn't see anybody? We did, we saw a guy, but not his face, it was too dark. Right. The acronym on his sweater, "UMI", stands for the industrial and maritime union, for which Michel and José worked before the robbery. It closed 10 years ago. No news from the guards. He must be on the island. He'd planned it all. He knows we're watching Aline. He's very smart. What about the CCTV? The resolution is no good. The faces are all blurred. But the resolution of the CCTV at the museum are great. Yeah. It's José. There's no doubt. - When was that? - 5 days before he died. OK, great job, guys. Really. Keep the plan as it is. He'll eventually turn up. Can you go and get Aline Ferrus? You promised you'd let me know if he contacted you. What if he had it in for you? Michel would never do me harm. Are you sure? Michel didn't do that. Back then, you seemed very close to José, too. There's never been any jealousy between them? The CCTV filmed José at the museum, 5 days before he died. That's proof he returned to the island. Did you see him? Now, Aline, you must stop lying to us. You're in danger. Your son, too. José came to see me, one evening, after closing time. His motor had broken down and he missed the tide. Mathieu was on the mainland. I offered him to come home. In high school, before Michel, José and I flirted for some time. But it didn't last. I was searching for true love. He wanted all the girls. And he did get them. So he came to your place that night. We talked. A lot. Mainly about the past. Of the time when we were... young, carefree, full of wishes and dreams. And then... everything resurfaced like a big wave. All gone to the wind... He took me in his arms. And I gave in. Hello. Adrien's waiting for you upstairs. Thanks. - Hello. - Hello. I've got some questions to ask you. May I? You're alone? Come on in. I'd like to know more about the monks' treasure. You discovered it, right? Yes. But what's it got to do with José's death. In his stuff, José had a copy of an old article on the sale of the treasure. Debasson, who was in charge of the sale, was beaten to death. - Now you see the connection? - Not really, no. But it's your job to turn over the stones. What do you want to know? How did you discover it? The island agrees to some archaeological works, in the summer. Volunteers. It was in the crypt of the church. One morning, I discovered something hidden in a wall, with, inside, a vase full of gold coins, gilders. The monks had hid it there when the island was annexed by Eble le Fourbe, in the 900s, the great time of Cluny. Well, the sale of those coins helped me fulfil an old dream. Set up a credit union, that only finances projects on the island. It's microcredit. It's very advantageous for the inhabitants. Why did you give away your share? It was of no use to me. That money helped preserve the island, the most precious good. Debasson, how did you meet him? We were in high school together. He was condemned for swindling people. I heard so. But we'd stopped talking. He and the island were worlds apart. He won't bother you anymore. Thank you. You're welcome. What about the report on the arson at Aline's mother's? "The witch." That's what the children called Louise Ferrus. No witness. No lead. Nothing surprising on this island. She bought the house in the late 80s. - Who was the former owner? - I've got it here. Jacques Lentier. "Jacques Lentier." Jacques Lentier, Jacques Lentier... Rose's husband. The father of Bernard, our dear postman. I've got the forensics report. Debasson died of internal bleeding caused by blows at the liver and abdomen. Surprise of the day: The time of death is the day before José's. The auctioneer was the 1st victim. I need the full copy of this act. It's the house of Aline's mother, the one that burned down. Make a request online to the mortgage department. You'll get an answer within 2 weeks. OK. I admit, dear judge, it was indeed me on your photo. I didn't call you back, nor did you. That's how it is. Summer love stories. It's not meant to last, isn't it? I need your help to close the investigation. Thank you. We'll see what we can do. - Bye, Alain. - Thanks. Hello, André. - You OK, Dad? - Yes. - Took your medicine? - Oh, enough! You know what she wants? No, I haven't got a clue. Thanks for coming. You recognise this object? Yes. It looks like the pottery I discovered in the crypt. At the time, pots like these must have been quite common. Aline, can you please come? Can you compare them? Especially the chipped part on the top. They're identical. And yet, its photo was published in an art magazine 1 year before it was discovered in the crypt. Mr Tessier, how can you explain this? Messing things around, setting us against each other, that, you know to do well! How do you think this island has been built? You know how many projects the credit union financed thanks to the diamonds? Yes. Er... Thanks to the gilders, I mean. You and Debasson were selling off the diamonds from the robbery? - My... - Please! Don't interfere! You said "diamonds"? Why, "diamonds"? Dad! You found them in the church? Answer. Call a doctor. Dad? - The stock of pearl oysters. - What? - In the workshop. - They were in there? You hid it from me? - You knew? - No. Who else knew? The whole island was aware, right? But did you know? He's pretending. He's always done that. - Mrs Ferrus! - Let go of me. It's a simple scam. Debasson disposed of the gilders that were robbed or taken from a wreck. André came with the diamonds. They do the exchange. They make up this story of the monks' treasure. André arranges the discovery of the gilders during an excavation, and then, he could legally sell them. The diamonds have always been here. André might have been the accomplice of Michel and José. My father only discovered them after the trial. They were hidden in the workshop. Since when do you know that? He just told me while being transported. He didn't do any wrong by not declaring his discovery. With the credit union he was helping people. The judge will appreciate. The motive of the murder is money. They tried to kidnap Agathe. She's in danger. You must protect her. Michel won't hesitate. Vincent, we've not finished. Find Agathe, keep her somewhere safe. I've got photos of the port taken the day before José died and the next morning. We can see a boat changed places during the night. Do you know which one? Mine. Another hypotesis. You know the wrongdoings of your dad and Debasson. You had a motive to kill José after he attacked your daughter. Maybe Debasson tried to blackmail you. It's ridiculous. Vincent Tessier, it is 4:42 pm. You are taken into custody as a suspect for the murder of José Chébèque. Is this necessary? A must. Your father's out of danger. He'll be charged with concealment and laundering. You might be charged with concealment, too. I knew nothing about the capital of the credit union. And the fact someone took your boat at night. The ignition's broken. Anyone would have taken it. You're the perfect innocent. Well, I don't abuse of my position to settle scores. I want a lawyer. I won't say anything until I get one. - Coming? - I'm not going. I said I'm not going. Excuse me. Thanks. Since you're here, I've lost half of my clients. They can't stand you, in the village. And today, you arrested the mayor. You know, if I were you, I'd be careful. Or you could land up in the moats. Thanks. That's already happened. Why go back to your maiden name after your husband died? I preferred mine. Lentier, sounds like lentil. I never like it. It's very nice. Thanks. I wanted to tell you. Aline shouldn't play the victim too much, because if someone took good advantage of the credit union, it was her. And her son. The "jinx" family. Hello. Thanks. Not a word about this letter to Aline. Nor anybody else. Will you show the gentleman out? It was posted on the island. "My love, "I wished things were different, "I wish I'd have seen you again, to hold you tight, "I wish that José never came back, I'd not have killed him. "I wanted him to leave, but he didn't want to. "I pushed him in the stairs. "By the time he was down, he was dead. Bye my angel. "I'm leaving. You'll never hear about me again. "You'll be in peace at last." Signed "Michel." The writing seems identical. The signature too. Michel surely knows we're watching the mail. It might be a snare. It's the murderer who wrote it. He knows how José died. Send the letter to the lab for analysis. Damn! The letter was posted on the island. Michel's roaming about freely under our nose. I did see smoke from the shed by the moats. What are you going to do? - We'll keep it. - That's good. It's important there are children on the island. - Otherwise, the school will close. - Agathe doesn't want to stay. What? You're going... And your mother? You can't do that to her. We've not made up our minds. We'll see. It's natural at your age. But believe me, they all come back, one day. You won't find better. What's this sweater? Nothing. What do you mean? It wasn't my father - it was you. What are you up to? Don't threaten me. It's none of your business. Not my business? You're pretending to be my father. - Why? - You want to know? I had to give your mother a message. A message from who? From... your father. He's on the island? I want to see him. Put that gun down. You're right. It's high time. Come with me. You got an answer from the mortgage department? about the title deed of the house that burnt down? OK. OK. I was wrong. You have nothing to do with the death of José Chébèque. But all the facts were against you, and my job is to combine them. I refuse to let anything else interfere. Anything else, like what? Your hatred of men or your grudge against me? Vincent, I really need this document. Must I beg you? Happy? Yeah. Can I go back to my cell? You need a shower but it'll have to wait. I must organize a family gathering. Alright... Vincent Tessier. It is 10:58. Your custody is over. Hurry up. Serge, did you see Bernard? They've gone. - Who, "they"? - Bernard and Mathieu, with the pick-up. - Thanks. Ask for the phones of Bernard and Mathieu to be located. I'm coming. I've got work to do. It won't be long. Aline, when your mother died, her house was burnt. Any idea who could have done that? Rose, your husband was the owner. It must have been a shock to see who he was bequeathing it to? But it's true. I almost forgot. On this island you settle matters in private, so, if you don't mind, I'll carry on. Louise Ferrus was living alone in that house with Aline, her daughter, whose unknown father was "a sailor passing by". Yes, sailors passing by, they come, make babies and go. Jacques surely had great esteem for his tenant to leave her the house. - Isn't it? - Quiet. She made up those stories. Why would I have done that? Because my son has got a crush on a bitch who thinks she's too good for him. It was mean to break his heart with such rubbish. You'd have preferred an incest? My mother told me that Bernard's father was mine too. She was the best to know. So, yes, I did tell Bernard. Like mother like daughter. - A dirty liar. - Stop. The DNA we found shows the murderer is a relative of Mathieu. We're hunting down the father, but it could be his uncle, Bernard. One second. Hang on. I think I've got something. So, 46 degrees, 1 min, 21 s, north and 1 degree, 9 min. Yeah? 52 s, west. Correct? OK. Thanks, Gégé. It's the GPS coordinates of Mathieu. He's there. - What's that? - The Liédot fort. It's disused. It's a real maze. If Michel's there, it will be hard to find him. Dimitri, find a plan. Adrien, gather everybody. We must be off in less than 3 minutes. Go, go, go! We spent hours scaring ourselves here with Michel. I'm fed up of your youth stories with my father. Your father saved my life in one of these galleries when it caved in on me. Come on, hurry up! Go around. Gégé, come with me. Aline! Stop! Block that door. Watch the ramparts. Mathieu, before you open it, I must tell you something. 20 years ago, your father made me promise I'd watch over you and your mum if things went wrong. That's what I tried to do, to respect my promise. That's why you wrote those letters? It was you, right? When did you understand? Now. They always came when I was down. How did you manage? A sailor friend posted them for me. You upset? I can't be upset, you saved my life. But now, you must open that door. I want to see him. Michel! Michel! - Where is he? - I'd promised Michel. - Where is he? - You liar! You bloody liar. Where is he? Yeah. Yeah, I'm a liar. After the storm in 99, the sea walls were being restored. I discovered the remains of Michel's body. I didn't know what to do. You were shattered. I feared you wouldn't cope. So, I buried him here. - It might not have been him. - It was him. He was wearing the stone you'd offered him. The garnet? That means you killed... Yes. It was an accident. I saw José at your place, that day, embracing you, kissing you. He was going to harm you. So, I went to see him. I took Vincent's boat to get to the fort. José let me in. He had no reason to be wary. So we had an explanation. When... When I showed him the garnet, he told me how he'd hidden the diamonds, and also, how he'd killed Michel. Understand, Mathieu? Your father would've never left you. He'd rather have got caught than leave without you. But José couldn't care a hang. They quarrelled. He killed him. When I heard that, I lost it. I jumped on him. In the stairs, his neck cracked like a bit of wood. Throwing him in the water would have been too good for him. So, I put him in the boat. He was going to wander like a lost soul forever. That's all. That's all that bastard deserved. The fort is surrounded. There's no exit. Drop that gun! Drop that gun. Bernard, stop! Bernard. Stop. OK. Don't move. Bernard. Don't do that. Come. Sorry. Contact Rochefort, we need a team. You did a good job, anyway. I'm the one who burnt Louise's house. But I'll answer for my acts. Adrien, this is for you. You see to Mrs Lentier. If Michel was dead, who killed Debasson? José. He came to get the diamonds he'd hidden in the workshop. There was nothing left. This monks' treasure intrigued him. He went to Debasson's, he made him talk. He must have had a shock when he realised the diamonds were now the credit union. After trying to abduct Agathe, he'd have got at André and you. She thought he was far away. But actually, he was buried here. Three weeks later... City Hall Hello. Hello. I thought I'd see you when Michel's coffin came in. It's a bit complicated, with the closure of the credit union. How's your dad? OK. He's in a nursing home waiting for his trial. This story has shaken him. You've really resigned? You've got projects? No. Well... Things went fast. I don't know. I might travel around. And you? Me? Well... I'm taking the next ferry. I'll walk you to the pier. Hello, sir. Agathe's beautiful. She dreamt of leaving the island. Now she's happier than ever. I thought I'd follow my father's footsteps... I wanted to apologise. You were right. When I recognised you the first day, I couldn't help it... Well, I did take advantage of the situation. I thought over our conversation on the beach. We can't come back on the past, on our choices, but... what stops us from imagining a different future? You've got my number. Vincent Pity I'm not your type... Because this time, I'm taking the same boat as you. Subtitles: ECLAIR
