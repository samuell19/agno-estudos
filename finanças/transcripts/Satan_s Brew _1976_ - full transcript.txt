WHAT DIFFERENTIATES THE HEATHENS FROM US IS THE GREAT RESOLVE UNDERLYING THEIR FORMS OF BELIEF NOT TO THINK IN HUMAN TERMS. IN THIS WAY, THEY ARE ABLE TO RETAIN THE LINK WITH THE WHOLE OF CREATION, IN OTHER WORDS, WITH THE GODHEAD. ANTONIN ARTAUD SATAN'S BREW l don't believe you. l don't believe a word you say. There, there, there! He's in there! There! l told you... he's not here. Yes he is. But he doesn't want to see me. All l can say is, he's not here. He doesn't want to see me. That's the truth of the matter. You're repeating yourself. Because l need money. Money! Money! Money! Want to bet he's in there? Only Jews who need money bet. l need money. But you're not a Jew. l must ask you to leave. l have to go, myself. Go, if you must! l'm staying till l get my advance. You've already had an advance of... 32,500 marks. -You said it. -What does that mean? lt's... too... little. But you haven't delivered a single line. That's none of your damn business! Mr. Kranz, l must ask you to moderate your language! Has that awful guy Kranz gone? There! You see! You gangsters! Gangsters! Bloodsuckers! Parasites! l want my money! Throw that nutcase out! He should deliver the goods first. You hear? He doesn't want to see you. Thanks. l got the message. Come up with something first. Potato heads! The lot of you! He's gone. Gangsters! Swine! Bloodsuckers! You think you can push us around, but just you wait! When you've been eaten by the worms, my name will still shine. Assholes! Fascists! Fascists! Fascists! Bastards! lt's fascinating how you deal with these people! Have a nice trip! Oh, it's you. Are you hungry? No, not at all. Honestly! On the contrary. Pity! l thought you might invite me out. Oh, l see. You're hungry? No, l just thought.... Hi, Walter! -Hello, Rolf! -ls she scratching herself? -Yes. -Good. She goes to the bathroom to scratch herself now. Really? Yes. l love you. -Want a beer? -No, thanks. There's none left anyway. -What's new? -l want to screw you like a stoat. Yes, but l don't want it poetic today. Come in! Oh, it's you. How did you get in? Did Rolf leave the door open? Did he? Did you leave the door open? l love you. l want to sleep with you. l don't want to, don't want to, don't want to! Your wife doesn't want to sleep with me. Don't be so uptight, Lisa! l don't want to. -l have to work. -Work, then! l can't concentrate. Come on! -No, no, no! -Stupid bitch! l love her. You hear? He loves you. -So what? -l need you. He needs you. Be reasonable! l don't want to! What can l do? You hear? She doesn't want to. Maybe... you could lend me some money? Get out! Out! Out! Beat it! Beat it! Take off! Get out of here! You owe me 650 anyway, you pig! And me 9. Bah! Come with me! Quick! Come on! You bitch! You revolting, clapped-out bitch! Thank you! Thank you! Shut your mouth! Did l say you could blab? Poppers! Crazy! Mama! Mama! Come here! Come here... darling! lt's good! Good! More! Money! Money! Money! Money, yes! More! Oh God, how it turns me on! lt turns me on! Money! lt turns me on! -l'm coming! -Sign it! l'm coming! Shoot! Shoot! Bah! Luise! Luise! -Five thousand? -Yes, l'm like that. Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! -What's the matter? -Pig! No one can understand what she sees in you. Who? Who? Who? That aristocratic cunt, von Witzleben. She appreciates my poetry. Poetry? Don't make me laugh! Pig! Flies, flies, flies! Peepeep! Peepeep! Flies! Ernst! Come here! Look! That's a pistol. Shoot flies. No! You fuck flies. You don't shoot them. Take the pistol and put it in the closet! Walter! Yes? The filthy pig! Walter! What's up? Look! He's spilt the garbage all over the apartment again. Because he wants to attract flies, you silly-billy. You can't understand any logic but your own. Because l have to work all day clearing away your filth. Don't shout, Luise! lt wastes the energy you need to work. ''Humanizing the world means... ''feeling ourselves more and more... ''as masters in it. ''At a higher level of being... ''this insight will assume new forms... ''that are not yet necessary.'' Supper's ready! Did you go to your publisher? Publisher? Oh, yes. l was there. And? l pissed in the tank of his car. Tell your brother to forget the flies while he's eating! But he's not eating. Auntie lrmgard fallen down. -Are they giving you an advance? -Advance? Yes. No, they're not. -No? -No. l phoned them up. Why do you ask me then? To see whether you lie. You haven't handed in a single line. Probably haven't written any either. Exactly. That's it. You're through, finished! You're all washed up! Stop playing with the flies, you pig! Sit down at the table! -Wash your hands! -Why should he? He hasn't washed his hands for two years. l've got it! l've got it! l've got it! l'll do an interview book. -l'll interview a whore-- -How original! You're such a negative person. You're not a person at all. Wash your hands! Paula! Tell your woman friend to phone me back! Fine! Thanks. You? You... you... you-- -Birdbrain! -Cunt! -Prick! -Quail! -Shithead! -Cow! -Asshole! -You, you, you-- Paula! Yes, that's right. l'll ask questions, and you answer. After my dad beat my mum to death and hanged himself... Uncle Edward became my guardian, and he raped me. Bah! Stop that! The lady's suffered enough, hasn't she? He pinched my breast. Oh, don't worry! He does that to all women. Oh, l see. ln that case.... Can you think of anything else l could ask you? No. Me neither. Had breakfast yet? -No. -Luise, where are you? ''And then l dreamed... ''as l wrote before... ''that you were deep inside me.'' Take that letter from her! You filthy bastard! Make.... Er, what was your name again? -Lana von Meyerbeer. -Right! Make a handsome breakfast for Miss von Meyerbeer! Why? Because she's hungry, hungry! -l don't want any-- -More hot water for me! -Do you earn a lot? -Sometimes. -How many men a day? -Up to ten. Ten! Did you hear that, limp-dick? When did we screw last? Let me see. -Three weeks ago? -Exactly! 17 days. You heard, 17 days ago! -Cook some ham and eggs! -Ten a day! But you're married. So there! Would you like to marry? Oh, no. That's nothing for me. l'm a loner. How much does it cost? 150 marks for a straight number, if you know what l mean. ''The grandeur of your granite... ''tenderness... ''makes the universe... ''of illustrious beings tremble.'' Ouch! Be careful! Here. Ugh! lt's a great honour. He doesn't give flies to everyone. Take it! lt's a present. -Thank you. -Fuck flies. -l beg your pardon? -He tries to fuck his flies. But without success so far, l think. Poor guy! -Ten? Really? -Yes, sometimes. That was the bell. l'm not deaf. Ernst gave the lady a fly. He must like you. -He's never given me one. -Sorry to hear it. Eat! l didn't spit in the food. -Does she sometimes? -Now and then, but she means well. -Crime squad. -We're not buying any.... Police? -May l come in? -Why? A woman friend of your husband has been murdered. -Mrs. von Witzleben. -Oh, how nice! l must tell him at once. There's a nice man from the police. Don't get up! A mistress of my husband has been murdered. Fancy that! Which one? Mrs. von Witzleben. How tragic! Ernst, Aunt lrmgard's been murdered. Shoot flies. How do you know she was shot? Ernst has the clairvoyance of the early saints. Take a seat! The water's just right. l won't say no to a morning footbath. Who murdered her? We don't know yet, but we have some clues. -ls that so? -Oh, yes. Could l have some of the eggs and ham, too? lt looks delicious. Didn't you hear? ls your wife offended? No, no. That's just her way. Really? Oh, yes. Ask Miss von Meyerbeer! -Yes, she's always like that. -Does she belong to the family? Yes, to the family. Can you imagine who could have murdered Mrs. von Witzleben? l'm afraid not. No one, apart from me. But it wasn't you, of course? How can you ask? l'm a poet. Ah yes, l almost forgot. -You know when he last slept with me? -No. 17 days ago! l had other commitments. -With Mrs. von Witzleben? -Among others. l know my rights. He has to sleep with me, by law. -Yes, l think he has to. -What, right now? Maybe you could wait a moment. l don't want to be unreasonable. Thanks. You withdrew a largish sum from Mrs. von Witzleben's account. Yes, l took the liberty. She liked my poetry. l suppose that's what one calls it. That was the doorbell! -The doorbell! -The doorbell! -The doorbell! -The doorbell! -Did you love Mrs. von Witzleben? -l am an anarchist, madam! Oh, l see. Ernst! Won't you give this nice gentleman a fly? Don't be upset! He needs longer with some people. Your alibi is watertight, l imagine? That depends on the time of the crime, l imagine. These nice men want to take the furniture we haven't paid off. Let them! -When did this terrible deed happen? -2 o'clock yesterday. Luise, pay Miss von Meyerbeer her fee! Sorry. As you can see.... Do you have an alibi? Maybe. Bring me a towel, please! Happy he, who forgets what can only cause regrets Where's Ernst? -ln the cupboard, l imagine. -ln the cupboard? Stop! Stop! Get out of there! You lump of gristle! Cowslip! Fishhead! Happy he, who forgets l'm going to see about my alibi. -Would be advisable, huh? -lt would. Are you going again? l demand my rights! Always these other women! Wait till another one's murdered. The police will be here every day, the furniture people, and women. l want a man! How did you do it? l shot her. Quite simply. That was stupid, really. You got so much money from her. Yes. Things aren't what they used to be. No. Nothing's what it used to be. Now l've got it. Something has blocked... the sound key... and jammed... the fast-forward. l must remove it... and then it will work again. l'm finished, too. How long is it... since l was last able... to do something... for you? You can say you were here yesterday afternoon. After all, it was a kind of revolutionary act... -wasn't it? -Oh, yes. Yes, yes. The revolution. And the lovely, lovely money. And the lovely love. Can l stay here tonight? l don't want to go home. They've taken the furniture away. l don't mind, but you'll have to ask Rolf. He's so strange sometimes and wants me all to himself. Okay... l'll ask him. Come in! Can l sleep with your wife tonight? l feel so lonely, and they've taken my furniture. -Has he paid his debts? -Yes. He's paid. Okay, but get stuck in! She gets more demanding with age. Sure. Thanks. You know, sometimes l feel... l have to change my life. Eighteen! What? Days. Eighteen days! Eighteen days! Eighteen days... without a kind word or gesture. -Fourteen. -What? Years. Coffee! Where's Ernst? l locked him in the closet. -Why? -l was mad. -About what? -You. Collective responsibility, huh? You fascist! You, too! -Fascist! Fascist! -Sleep with me, please! Sorry l'm late. The taxi-- That doesn't matter. Time's such a relative thing. We got as far as your uncle. -Which uncle? -The uncle who raped you. Oh, yes. lt was terrible, indescribably terrible. Why can't l phone you at home? l don't want it. lmpossible! Do clients come to your home? How can you ask? l'm rather shy, you know. l know. l want to sleep with you. Right now! lf you like. lt's all money. ls there any warm water? -ln the bathroom, left-hand faucet. -Thanks. A fine state of affairs! ln my own home! For study purposes, Luise. Purely as research. You don't think l'm interested in that little whore? Stop that! He.... He tried to.... You should be used to that, surely. Get into the kitchen! Drop your pants! Lean over the chair! l'm sorry, but my brother's not capable... of rational behaviour. -Everyone according to his lights! -Exactly! Get out! He enjoys it. Did you hear, Luise? -He enjoys being beaten. -He's your brother. But it's revolting! You've no right to laugh at my husband! Sorry, l forgot to think. Pay her her fee! And don't forget the receipt! 150 Marks? Some men give me 20 for the taxi. You come to us with the subway. Here, DM 152.50. Did you enjoy it? Not really my thing. He finishes too quickly, don't you think? Yes, l agree. -But it's better than nothing. -Good day to you! The same to you! Fuck flies. Ernst, Luise, come here! l've written something new for the first time in two years. Listen! ''And sometimes seamen catch for pleasure... ''the albatross, the great bird of the sea... ''that follows freely at its leisure... ''ships that through rocky straits must pass.'' -lsn't that brilliant? -Yes, yes. Then proclaim your enthusiasm! Out with it! My God... how primitive! How primitive you all are! The revolutionary situation no longer exists, mother. Typical of youth! Nothing but a flash in the pan! A revolutionary situation exists as long as people are oppressed... and exploited by others. But mother, that's got whiskers on it! Yes, Karl Marx's whiskers. Lisa! Lisa, the time has come! Mother... this is Walter Kranz. The poet of revolution? God alone knows how l esteem you! Oh, thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Lisa, l've been writing again. Yesterday, depression. Today, a stroke of genius. Silence, you person! l'll begin. The Albatross. ''And sometimes seamen catch for pleasure... ''the albatross, the great bird of the sea... ''that follows freely at its leisure... ''ships that through rocky straits must pass. ''But once on deck, that monarch of the azure tides... ''crestfallen, drags its white wings... ''at its sides. ''Once swift, now stiff and worn... ''the sovereign of the air must suffer slights--'' Walter! The people! Walter! -My God, you're so bourgeois! -Let go of me, mother! ''But down among the happy crowds--'' Will you please get down from the chair? -You can't behave like that here. -Whatever you say. But exceptional people tend to do exceptional things. -A bottle of champagne! -Yes, sir. How do you like it? -Quite nice. -Nice? -But rather reactionary, isn't it? -So what? -And-- -And? And anyway it sounds familiar. Familiar? Yes! l lifted it? You mean, l lifted it? l've never stolen anything. l'm misjudged. Ladies and gentlemen, you heard how l am misjudged most ignominiously. l've never stolen anything. Never! Never! Never! Never! Never! What a man! What power! Mother, pick the chair up if you admire him so much! lf you say so. The poet is like that monarch of the clouds. My name's Lauf, criminal investigation department. -That man, is he an acquaintance of yours? -A lover. -A good one? -Sometimes. He told me about the murder. -He was with me when it happened. -ln bed? On the floor. We prefer the floor, you know? -No? -Oh, yes. Wipe the sugar up, mother! Why isn't the murder mentioned in the papers? Why? Oh... we're holding it back until we catch the murderer. ''And sometimes seamen catch for pleasure... ''the albatross, the great bird of the sea... ''that follows freely at its leisure... ''ships that through rocky straits must pass.'' That's my poem. Here! Stefan George. Exactly! Stefan George. But that's impossible! Stealing, flies. Stealing, flies. ldiot! ldiot! ldiot! l didn't steal it. Or l.... -You must believe me, Luise. -l believe you, Walter. Things like that can happen. Things like that can happen, really. Why Stefan George of all people? Why are you crying? Tell me why you're crying. l live in a house full of idiots. ''Perfumes like infants' cheeks there are, sweet as oboes. ''Others of decay, breath of things unlimited... ''amber, musk and incense... ''through which the rapture of our souls sing.'' Did you really like it? Lovely flies! Lovely! Yes, that's by me, too... isn't it? ''Again my inner self cannot make... ''this monstrous mantle of flesh about my soul... ''show more restraint towards you, my genius. ''So this hand writes anew, hoping to be moved and guided. ''For a long time, l was desperate with loneliness. ''Then l dreamed, as l wrote before... ''that you were deep inside me. ''The grandeur of your granite tenderness... ''makes the universe of illustrious beings tremble.'' Walter Kranz here. ls that Andr?e? Have you fainted? Kranz speaking. Yes, it's really me. You've been writing to me for years. You admire me, want to meet me. Now the time has come. You can come to me. l'd like to get to know you. Good. Send me a telegram when you come, l'll pick you up. ''Veiled bud... ''blossom chaste. ''A cool light. ''A harsh hint of air.'' Hey! You great, fat... slob! Come in! lf you don't stop laughing... l'll slaughter you. A telegram for you. What does it say? ''Arrive tomorrow 4:10 p.m. ''Ardently, A.'' Get out! Tell me... how it was... when you felt me deep inside you? lndescribable. Really? l lived for you alone. Then one night you came... a poem on your lips. l licked it off... in devotion. -How unpleasant! -Pardon me? -You have obscene dreams. -Yes, don't l? You lick poems from strange men's lips. You're no stranger. You're my husband. Oh, l see. That explains everything. Every morning l pray for an hour before your photo. -l don't believe in God. -lt doesn't matter. -My faith is enough for both of us. -Thank you. No need to thank me. That goes without saying. -Did you study literature? -lt's all in my letters. -You want to put me to the test? -No. But l read only one letter in three. l understand. You are a busy man. No, l haven't studied. l inherited a stationery shop with my sister. l remember. -You see! -What? You were having me on. -You did read all my letters. -Maybe. -Andr?e, tell me-- -Yes? Are you rich? Good heavens, no! Elvira and l just get by. Elvira? Elvira's my sister. l mentioned her in nearly all my letters. Her impertinence, her ignorance, her arrogance, her prejudices. Ah, you hate your sister? Oh, no. She's not worth that. She's a little... fusty person. God has punished her with a bad hip. Do you have any money with you? l forgot my purse. Yes... of course l have money. Not a fortune. l'm not wealthy, unfortunately. That doesn't matter. One can't help it. Yes, sir? Two coffees and two cognacs. French, please. By the way, you forgot to pay last time. Then put it on the bill today! Don't shout at me! l'm just doing my job. Scum! Ugh! Don't get upset! lt's not worth it. How right you are! Tell me... do you think l'm ugly? No, no. Not ugly at all, only-- Yes? You haven't washed your arms. Your forearms are dirty. My God! You're right! Everything happened so quickly. Normally l'm scrupulously clean. My God, how embarrassing! -Would you mind paying now? -But that's.... -DM 19.80. -Let me pay! l don't mind. Thank you. Where can l stay? At my place, l thought. l knew it! l was sure of it. -Thanks. -Don't mention it. Do you like Stefan George? Stefan George? Do you like him? Oh yes. l guess so. His poems are... very, very beautiful. Yes. He's the greatest German poet. You think so? Maybe you're right. But didn't he cause.... Didn't Stefan George cause a lot of hullabaloo? No! No! That wasn't a hullabaloo! l'm sorry, but.... Doesn't matter. How could you know? But what you call ''hullabaloo'' is really something very serious... something very true. Stefan George wanted his poems to be presented in a certain ambiance... not torn from their proper context. His language... is the most limpid German ever written... comparable only with that of Nietzsche. Pure, true art. An art that needs the right setting. lt's not something one can feel in a tram or in the bathroom. ln the bathroom? Yes. lt requires an inner receptiveness in people. One must be in a state of empathy with it. One has to glow for this language. And few people can open their hearts to something great. That's why George cultivated a certain circle of people... and read his poems only in this circle. He didn't want their purity sullied. How you enthuse! How beautiful you are when you enthuse about something. Do you think l'm like him? You have the strength to be what you want. Yes. l have the strength to be Stefan George. Luise! Luise! This is Aunt Andr?e, Ernst. Say hello and shake hands! Silly boy! Can't you see auntie is a virgin? Fuck flies? Leave him alone! He's a good boy. -But-- -Poppycock! Luise! This is my wife. And this is ''A stop. 4:10 p.m. Ardently.'' Make her bed! Don't worry. l'll get used to you. l beg your pardon! l enjoy his absolute trust. You don't say. And... come here! l'm his real wife, you know... not you. Oh... l see. Ernst, you lucky boy, you have a sister of kindred spirit. Give thanks to God! There! You can make it yourself. Kranz! Kranz! l'm completely open for you. Completely and utterly open. ''Humanizing the world means... ''feeling ourselves more and more as masters in it.'' Must you make such a noise so early in the morning? l'm used to the best of service. My father couldn't stand these unnatural sounds... if you know what l mean. Oh, how l know! lt's an indescribable stroke of fortune to grow up in a wealthy, cultivated family. My God, always having great, proud people about one. How l envy you! Ah, my parents... unfortunately, both departed. Both of them? You poor thing! Don't feel sorry for me! Give Ernst your sympathy! Parental help could have avoided much grief... poor little idiot. Oh! Oh, my God! l can't stand this row at breakfast. Cut the act! Who do you think you are? You, l ignore entirely. He... spat egg in my face! He probably had nothing else in his mouth. My time will come. No one understands me. l have decided to change my life. Go work in a factory! Maybe that'll cure you. l'll have a suit made to measure. l wouldn't put it past him, though he doesn't have any money. He hasn't worked for two years. Bah! How brutal you are! Every genius needs a creative rest. You silly goose! You can't insult me. l'll let him have my modest savings. l need a suit in the style of the belle ?poque. And quickly! l expect you at my place at.... No! Not that! Don't hit her! Never hit a woman! Sorry, interference in the line. My name is Kranz... Kaulbachstrasse 89. l expect you in a few minutes. You and l, we both know... you have to be punished. Yes. lnto the cellar with you! The key's next to the door, the one with the wards. Kneel on the coal and contemplate! ''Our Father which art in heaven... ''hallowed be Thy name. ''Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. ''Give us this day our daily bread... ''and forgive us our trespasses... ''as we forgive them who trespass against us.'' Ernst, your new aunt.... Well? Flies die, good! That's right, my boy! Death is the finest thing about life. Remember that! Blockhead! Take an example from Ernst! True genius lies in madness. -Walter! -Don't sully me! Remember the fate of the Galician Jews! l'm a German, Luise, a German man, a poet and thinker. Your excursions into history don't interest me. Open the door! That'll be the tailor! Be polite to him! Are you the tailor? Be a tailor, be a king. Nothing else is interesting. My husband's waiting in the salon. Second door on the right. My dear lady, have a heart for a desperate European! Come in! Fly dead! Storm Troop Leader! An ensemble like that, maestro. Can you do it? That? That's traditional craftsmanship. Traditional craftsmanship. -And you ask me? -Cheers! Thanks. But aren't you too fat for an outfit like that? Too fat? Belly... done in? Belly done in. Lisa, yes. Walter here. Yes. But you stand to gain through me. You don't bear a grudge, surely? l have to see you. l have to. Of course. The only suitable place is Nymphenburg. Yes, the Badenburg. But that's totally unimportant! Aren't you finished yet? A thing well done takes time. How German! How very German! Ernst! See you soon! Come here! Go to the cellar! Your new aunt's there. You can do what you like with her. l need you, my baby. l need you. You must get a divorce and come to me! A good idea! l'll move in with you and your brave little wife... and your crazy brother. l'm not joking, Lisa. l want you to leave Rolf! l'm not asking you. l demand it. Walter... you're hurting me. Yes, because l want to hurt you. Let me go! l'll catch a chill. Very well. As you wish. You pig, pig, pig! Who would have helped you? Pig! Do you think anyone would dare raise his hand against me? Sometimes l believe... you mean what you gabble. Shut up! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! You're really crazy! l'm not crazy, Lisa. l just have a mind of my own. -A mind of your own. -Get undressed and stop talking! l can't stand your voice anymore. So you can't stand my voice? You can't stand my voice! What do you think you are? Nothing. l just happen to be more important than you. More important than me? Yes. l'm a poet. Get undressed, or l'll have to beat you again. lf you touch me again, then.... See? Your willpower's already failing. Be a good girl! Get undressed! l want you now! Here, at once! Come on, please! Just hold it, Walter! Take it easy! Take it easy! There's something wrong. l... don't love myself anymore. What else? Nothing. l love Stefan George and-- And what? And so... l am Stefan George. l can't go on. You'd better go. Take care of yourself! l can't help you out of it. No. -And-- -Yes? Excuse me! Well, maestro, another corpse in your vicinity? That's Miss Hackebeaut, my brother's mistress, and very much alive. Open your eyes! You see? l see a woman, raped and bleeding. Rape? l beg you! ln every act of coitus, is there not an element of rape? Or murder? That can't be excluded either. How right you are. Did you murder Mrs. von Witzleben after all? l murder only those l love. We still haven't found the weapon. Then keep searching, my friend! What are you paid for? Won't you come in? Please. Seek, and ye shall find! Sorry, but l don't have a search warrant. Then you'll have to wait. l've been waiting 40 minutes, and your wife won't give me a drink. Go away! Tell him not to look at me like that. Leave auntie in peace, Ernst! She doesn't want you looking at her. Quiet! Luise! Ernst, pull yourself together! What will your aunts think of you? Look after Miss Hackebeaut! She's found true happiness. -Look at you! You're filthy! -Go to my room and get undressed! -My hour's up in 10 minutes. -Everything okay? You're so good to me. -ls he sleeping with this woman? -Now and then he manages to. ''Myriad stars burst within my head.'' ls that by you? Philistine! lt's early Walter Kranz. ''ls there no one who will vouch for her dreams, no hand... ''flesh of her flesh, that would reach down to her?'' Does this language not open your heart? l can't imagine what you want with my open heart. -You've only one thing in mind. -Money rules the world. l must change my life. Leave me now! At once! Can you imagine the sensation when this... huge lump of flesh plunges into you? My God! How awful... isn't it? -l want my money. -What do you want? -Money! -Money! Money! Money! Money! Money! Money! Money! Money! Money! l must change my life. Change it. You heard, you cow! -How much have you saved? -About 2,000 marks. Then he won't be able to change his life very much. lt's difficult to explain what l conceive. lt's embarrassing for me, if you understand what l mean. -Are you gay? -What? My God, no! -What gave you that idea? -lt's perfectly obvious. Because of the five young men? But... gay! Really! Oh... l.... Don't you find me attractive? Oh, sure! But what? But, but.... Just but. Maybe you could help me undo my bra? l could if l would.... But you wouldn't want to? Oh, yes! Well then.... You pig! You're all the same. Bah! -l don't understand a thing. -Yes, l know that line, too. You didn't know what came over you, and all that stuff. -l must say-- -lt's okay. Forget it! You need five young men? Yes, please. Latin types? -lf you think so. Maybe-- -Okay, Latins. Maybe.... Well? Maybe one or two could be German. Germanic Germans. Germanic? Yes. -They don't have to be good actors? -l don't think so. l should hope not! Look at these! Be quick! l'm hungry. Sell Mannesmann shares. Good Hope Foundry... 50,000. l know, even so.... And BMW. Thanks. l'd like to meet these guys, if it's possible. Minotinovitsch Agency. ''Come to the park they say is dead, and see... ''the gleam of distant smiling shores...

Every Thursday the same palaver. lt's no palaver, Mrs. Kranz. lt's bourgeois asceticism, the noblest of all things. Poor fool! Can you pay me? l have to go. My friend was at the ballet. He gets all heated up. What's up? lt's nearly over. At last! Thanks, old boy. l appreciate your sacrifice. Thanks, old girl. You castrated swine! -He took his favourite flies. -Take them off the chair! Flies! God! ''The evening zephyr blew, and fortune slowly goes. ''Take it, and treasure it, too, before another does. ''But, as if in fetters here, the soul grows pale and moans... ''sensing that bliss is near, yet unable--'' No! You creature! Human creatures also have a place among the gods. lt's curious... though the language is beautiful in part. Yes, it is beautiful. What do you want? You. You. l want you. l need you now! Now! Whore! Yes, yes, yes, yes! Put on a thin summer dress and go walking by the river till 5:15. That'll take you off heat. Go on, show your thanks! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, my great one! Walter, Andr?e has no more money. Very well. l'll go to the bank tomorrow. Hello, Mr. Kranz. Excuse me, Mr. Kranz! What is it? The check you've just signed.... Well? What about it? l'm sorry, but you signed with the wrong name. See for yourself! That's quite correct. -Stefan George. -Exactly! Stefan George. You have a completely different style. Oh, my God! Yes! l'm sorry. l was so wrapped up in thoughts. l'm working on something about... -George and-- -l understand. But... l had to point it out to you. Excuse me! Of course. l'm just... so sensitive. Naturally. But there's another thing. Yes? l have to tell you... your account is... if you'll pardon my saying so... your account is heavily overdrawn. You don't say? Yes, it is. Maybe you should.... Maybe you should try working again. Now that's a good idea. A brilliant idea! l'll set about it right away. l'm on my way. l wanted to say, l love your works. l'm one of your greatest fans, a real fanatic. Oh, l'm so sorry! Do you know... the man who knocked you over is a poet. A poet? -Oh well, in that case-- -Precisely! lt doesn't hurt so much then. Here, l'm still creditworthy. What's all this? ''What's all this?'' You've murdered her, like the other one. -But she's still breathing. -She's got a raging fever. -What'll l do with the corpse? -What's the matter with her? Did l send her out in winter in a summer dress without a coat and till 5:15? Oh, that.... But l... didn't mean it seriously. You must be careful what you say and to whom. That's ridiculous! A petit bourgeois view of history. ''Yesterday... ''on horses proud.... ''Today, in the....'' You see. That's Uhland! l beg you! Why doesn't she quote George in her death throes? Walter! Yes? l'm ill, too. Very ill! Very, very! Belly done in. The oppressed seek refuge in illness. From what should l seek refuge? From reality, the challenge of the sublime. No, Walter. l have nothing to flee from. These things are trifles. Trifles? You dare to? What liberties you take! You belly, belly, belly! Just look at yourself! -This business with George-- -Yes? You can't be him, Walter. George was gay. Ho-mo-sex-ual. Understand? He invented it, Walter. Gay? Gay! Walter... l'm dying. Yes? Do you fancy him? Who? My little friend. l call him Fridolin. l had a woman once, called Frieda. l thought Frieda and Fridolin go well together. Oh, sure. Yes. l'm a poet, as well. -l thought as much. -Yes? One can see it... and sense it. Sure, when you look like something out of the past, with your watery eyes. Watery eyes? Me? Don't get me wrong. No one can help how he looks. Take me, for example. Without my Fridolin, l'd be lost. -Shall we go to your place? -No, for heaven's sake! My wife's at home-- Oh, you're married? l wouldn't have thought it. See how easily one can be mistaken! Then we'll go to a hotel. You'll have to pay. -Oh! -Yeah? Wait a minute! lt's all too fast for me! Do you want it another way? No... not that. How then? Are you into something special? Can't we talk first? Talk? lf pigs could whistle! My time's precious. l'm not familiar with all this. -Do you want me to fuck you? -No, no! Good heavens, no! A blowjob? Okay... come on! Sorry, but... l'm not in form today. That's your problem. You'll still have to pay me. My friends, we are fortunate to witness great things. The god of beauty has manifested himself... to me, Stefan George. ''Beside white birch stems bare of all covering... ''you stand on flowered ground... ''a god so near.'' ''Divine being... ''god, you, Maximin! ''Reveal your realm to us! Tell us of your world!'' Well, er.... -''There is true poetry....'' -''There's poetry....'' ''Turned to pure aroma....'' ''Yes, it's turned to pure aroma, the poetry....'' l know him from the station. ''And suffering and despair....'' ''And suffering and despair are....'' -Are what? -''Congealed to art.'' These are devotions. This is.... Get out, you... bungler, murderer! He has murdered him. Stefan George is dead, murdered by a hireling. But l have awoken. l feel my own strength within me. l shall write again. You'll come to hear my poetry? Please come! lf you continue to pay me, l'll listen to your effusions, too. You're all whores... venal trash. l don't have any more money. l'm finished. l'll come. l love you. l adore your strength. Thank you, my friend. -What about my money? -Go into the kitchen. My wife will pay you. l'll see you next Thursday! ''Humanizing the world means feeling ourselves more and more as masters in it.'' Put on your coat and come with me! -But the girl's sick. -She's the only person who understands me. -She will follow me to the end of the world. -And l'll have to nurse her. Monster of little faith! Here! A fly! Thanks, my dear. lt's good of you, but almost too late. My God! Oh... is he your god, too? -Who's she? -The little country girl, remember? The one you allowed to come? l remember. Exactly. May we come in? lf you don't get up to your nonsense. Andr?e is one of the weak sort. Poor thing! What does that mean? -Stefan George is dead. -Yes, l know. Since 1934. -How prosaic you are! -Like a drink? -l'll have a cognac. -Andr?e doesn't drink. You don't drink? You heard. You heard. You heard what he said! What? Take a seat! Form a bridge! A bridge. What idiocy is this? lt's no ''idiocy,'' as you brainlessly describe it. lt's a documentation of the truth. Ah, do as you like! Here! Comfortable, darling? My supreme aspiration is... to be used by a strong man. Oh, l see. Get up! That's the point. There are strong people and weak. -What a shattering insight! -lsn't it? Stand still! Don't move! No! lt's our most valuable piece. -Nothing but trouble with you! -Because l'm an imaginative person. Crawl underneath! -As l was saying, a demonstration of truth. -Oh, it's you. Hi! Ow! What the hell's that? Just an acquaintance of mine. Oh! Good evening, miss! Good evening! l must be going. Take care, my friends! -What about your-- -My slave? Don't worry! Send her home if she's in the way! l'm sorry, but that's... fascism! That's right. Fascism will triumph. What? He could be right. Andr?e didn't come home. Do you know where she is? Under the carpet. You haven't? No, she's still alive. That nice policeman's here, searching for the gun. Oh, yes? -What are you doing? -l'm writing again. He's writing! He's writing again! The Lord's letting him write again. Don't have a heart attack! Make some coffee! Yes, Walter, of course. l have slept with a man! -Hey! l slept with a man! -You don't say. And his wife was watching TV in the next room. Looking for something? A pistol. Just a minute. -No, no, no, l was dreaming. -Thanks. Don't mention it. He's writing again. Did you know? Kranz? Did you hear? He's writing again. My hearing's quite good. Kranz, l hear you're writing again. lt's just streaming out of me. Look, page after page. Wonderful! And l.... l've slept with a man. -Really? -Yes. With your girlfriend's husband, Rolf. He's one of the strong kind, like you. His wife was watching TV in the next room. lsn't that significant? Poor Lisa! Ernst, Uncle won't harm your flies. He's just looking for a gun. Thanks. Do you have to touch his flies? -l'm looking for a murder weapon. -He doesn't collect tsetse flies! You don't grasp the situation. -Good morning, Mr. Kranz! -Good morning! l slept with a man. -You already told me that. -What a pity! -Have you found the gun? -What do you think l'm doing? What do l know? The human mind is a realm of its own. Ernst? Don't we have a pistol in the house? Are you sure, you little rascal? Then beat it, you idiot... crapbrain, nutcake! -This small-time whore-- -Whore? -Spare-time prostitute or whatever. -Yes, yes. Snappy number, hard-working. Her name's Meyer, not von Meyerbeer. Comical, huh? -Have you, with her? -A cop's only human. Yes, one forgets that. Have you found the murder weapon? -Maybe some other time. -Yes, maybe. lf anything occurs to you, give me a call. 444 77. 444 77. lt's all up with me. l feel it. l'm ill. -l shall die soon. -That's the fate of the weak. l beg your pardon? There are strong people and weak, you fool! Most are weak. Few are strong. You don't know anything. When someone like you dies, it's but the blink of an eyelid for the strong. lt's quite insignificant. The death of the weak. The money's all gone again. Look in the old almanac! The money's all gone. -All l hear is ''money.'' -l have to do the shopping. Sell yourself and use that! Mother! Mother? l'm going out. And don't follow me, Andr?e! My God! ls it really Walter? Hello, Mom! Maybe he'd like to come in. You think so? May l? l saw you on TV three years ago... in September. lt's true, Fritz, isn't it? On Aunt Anna's birthday. l didn't understand a word you said. lt was all so clever. -She cried. -You cried. -You! -You! -You! -You! Would you like a drink? My car's broken down just round the corner. The chauffeur's broken his leg. l must have the car towed away. The breakdown people want cash, and l have only checks. l think he's trying to say he needs money. But his chauffeur's broken his leg. Exactly! Oh, l see. There's the money for our funeral. Where did you hide it today? -My God, l-- -Have you forgotten? Why must you always forget where you've hidden the money? Try to concentrate! Think! ln the pillow? ln the radio? ln the cupboard for winter things? What would you do if l had died today? l know! lt's in the cuckoo clock. Walter. l'll send the chauffeur round. -But-- -He's broken his leg. Get out! l told you to get out. You lied to me. So what? You lied, lied, lied! l apologize. The lady's a bit muddled. -Sorry, you see yourself. -lt doesn't matter. He lied to me. lt was all a lie. Sure! You see. He says so, too. There you are! Stupid bitch! There are your parents. -l know. -Well? Well what? What? What? -You owe me an explanation. -Because l lied to you? Who do you think you are that l can't lie to you? Them! Them! Riffraff! Cheapskates! Parasites! Calm down! How did l imagine your parents? As great, proud people, living in a villa with a park. And now this! They're poor! Your parents are poor mites! You come from... a pitiful background. People like you will always be deceived... and exploited and oppressed. -Or have you forgotten all that? -Enough of this! My time's precious. l'm sorry! ''On a gridiron, like St. Lawrence... ''like St. Vincent... ''they wished to roast me, singeing the hairs on my chest... ''my pubic hairs, those on my legs. ''ln the end, they wished to burn me limb by limb... ''in little, unquenchable flames, constantly renewed.'' -Brilliant! -Really brilliant! -And so romantic. -Romantic? As you wish. Everyone reads what he likes into it. But what's more important, l've found a title at last. Yes? No Celebration for the F?hrer's Dead Dog. ''No....'' Oh! Oh! May l bring my brother next time? l'm sure he'll revere you as much as l do. Of course. Of course, my young friend. The money's all gone. But l gave you 2,300 marks only two days ago. The rent, phone, electricity, gas, debts... and the doctor. What a profane person you are! She's so profane! Okay, Luise. l'll get some money for you again. Just go now! Get some money! l have such pains. And don't follow me this time! -You're suddenly walking so fast. -What do you want of me? l want to be near you. l have to be near you. You're crazy! Go to hell! You can't come with me. l'm going for a fuck. Understand? A fuck! You? Yes, me. -You're in luck. -What? -Have you come to pay your debts? -Maybe. -How did you find my address? -l exerted myself. -For what reason? -A nice policeman helped me. The pig deceived me, too. lt always happens to the same people. What do you mean? -Do you want to insult me? -Offer me something to drink! No. You still owe me money. Yes, yes. That's an interesting photo. Don't touch it! Why? -ls it your husband? -That's none of your business. Who knows? What do you mean? Just think! You, you.... Yes? You want to blackmail me? That's right. lt's quite simple. -l need money. -We all need money. Maybe. But in this case, l'm the one who needs the money. -Where's your husband? -Away on assembly work. -That's all l wanted to know. -And l thought you were an artist! You, ugh! You, you.... A speech defect? Poor thing! Leave speaking to those predestined to speak. Here! Take what you want! One doesn't do things like that. One doesn't deceive honest citizens. Many thanks. See you next time. Bye! Get out! You've been beaten. Yes. Yes, l've been beaten. You're smiling? You've been beaten and you smile? You.... You're like me. Oh, what a fool l am! What a stupid cow l am! l let myself be deceived... deceived by a weakling. l'm so ashamed. The shame of it! To think l wanted to sacrifice myself to you! Someone like me! l spit on you. Spit then! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That is the finest humiliation. To expose oneself to an inferior. Oh, no. That's no humiliation. lt's inbreeding, pure inbreeding. lt's filth, filth, filth! l don't love you anymore. l never loved you. l despise you. l banish you to the deepest dungeon of my memory and let you starve. Bah! l am happy! Here, Mr. Kranz! Cheers! lf l had kept giving you more advances... you'd never have written a line. What does that mean? Do you want to propagate productivity through hunger? You don't look as if you've starved. Cheers! You stink. The stench is killing me. And your voice! Mr. Kranz, we're civilized people! Are we really? Stop whining, you silly goose! He doesn't mean it personally. He does. You like it when people say you stink. lt takes all sorts! By the way... the book is good. l beg your pardon? No, l mean it. l read it in one go last night. lt has power. But you know that yourself. Not that leftist junk... you used to fabricate. lt's big! l have an advertising slogan, too. ''An epic from the sordid depths of humanity.'' What do you say? Appropriate. l've embarked on it. We go into production at once. Tomorrow. l must go. Do l get any money? -Well-- -Do l? All right. Erika has an advance for you. Thanks. That's really smart of you. Advance! Sign! Money! Count it! Thanks. l just wanted to tell you... of course you don't stink. No? No. You just smell bad. Pay the taxi, Willy! Come on, Urs! Here, Ernst, look! We'll make an experiment! We'll see how long you can bear being whipped. What's the matter? You don't want to? Auntie. Belly done in. Luise? Aunt Luise. Belly done in. Hospital. Katharina. Katharina Hospital? Come on, Willy! We must go to the hospital. -11-826. -11-828. -11-845. -11-843. Mr. Kranz? Here, Walter Kranz! Your wife is dead. No! Luise! l need you! You belong to me! You're my wife before God and man. Come back, Luise! You'll get more housekeeping money. Revolting, the way he's behaving! He always preached that death and decay are the goal of life. Long live death! No true German behaves like that. Walter Kranz is dead for me. Dead and buried. Please excuse this embarrassing outbreak. l was behaving as l assumed you'd expect someone in my position to behave. Your act convinced us. Did it? Thanks. -Are you writing again? -Yes. l've finished a new novel. Congratulations. When is it due out? What's it called? lt's in the autumn program. lt will be called: No Celebration for the F?hrer's Dead Dog. How exciting! Aunt Luise is dead. l've decided to change my life. l shall withdraw into solitude. l'll phone that nice policeman... and tell him who shot Aunt lrmgard. You remember? Bring the pistol! 444 77. Hello! Yes. Walter Kranz here. l've found the pistol. My brother committed the murder. My wife died suddenly today. That's why l wanted to tell you.... l'll be with you in a few minutes. Auntie lrmgard, bah! Auntie Lana, Auntie Luise... Auntie Andr?e, Auntie Lisa... the uncle from the police... Uncle Eugen, Urs, Willy, Mom, Dad, me... and Walter. Well, where's the corpse? Auntie lrmgard! -Hello, Walter! -Bring a bucket of water! Dead! Dead! Dead! Thanks. Play some music! ls this.... Am l in paradise? Auntie lrmgard... Walter! What a marvellous amusement! Blanks! Blanks! Rolf has left me! Just imagine... he wants to open a stationery store with your country wench in the provinces. With Andr?e? That's right. l'm moving in with you. l don't want to be alone, and your wife died today, didn't she? Yes. -That's correct. -There you are. l'll just check out the kitchen. Walter, l need some shopping money. Give her that! Here! Thanks. Auntie Lisa.
