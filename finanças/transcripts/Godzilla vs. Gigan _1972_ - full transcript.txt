Eeek! WHAM! BOOM! lt's here! lt's the monster Shukra! ls Shukra invisible? l'm still... um... working on it. ldiot! Don't bring me half-baked ideas! Sorry. What kind of monster is it anyway? - A homework monster. - Homework? lt's like you said. ln your survey, kids all said they hated homework most, right? And that's Shukra? lt's too simplistic! Kids today are more sophisticated. Exactly! The telepathic power of these homework-hating kids strikes an alien substance out in space, and it mutates into a monster. No good? lt stinks! Too bad. After all that work getting you in the door. Where should we try next? Hold on! l want to take a little break. There's no time for that. My project team needs to start selling some ideas. Here's the next place. "World Children's Land Construction Committee." - You know of it, right? - They're building Godzilla Tower. - That's right. - What's my job this time? Shoveling dirt? Stop complaining and just go. What's that look? You Mamagon! What? Care to repeat that? Not really. Especially since you're a black belt in karate. WORLD CHlLDREN'S LAND CONSTRUCTlON SlTE CONSTRUCTlON OFFlCE What do you think? lmpressive, isn't it? And Godzilla Tower here... is a good idea. Very good, in fact. The tower will feature an exhibit on past, present, and future monsters. The elevator takes you up to Godzilla's head for a thrilling view. lt will be over 1 60 feet tall. We'll include airway beacons and an observatory as our way of giving back to the community. A playground for the kids, a library, a cafeteria... there's room for all that and more. Here children will learn about peace. Peace. You understand? lt's already pretty peaceful. No, it's not. Superficial peace is easily shattered. l'm speaking of absolute peace. That alone can save the planet. Monsters and peace? lt doesn't make sense. Yes, it does. Children will learn about absolute peace here. And what would my role be? l want Children's Land to be all it can be. Any ideas? Anything at all? There aren't enough monsters to keep kids entertained. You need more, like Shukra and Mamagon. Shukra? Mamagon? The homework monster and the strict-mom monster. Not very peaceful, huh? No, l like it. Bring me some designs right away. lf you're looking for more ideas, how about the monsters living on Monster lsland? We thought of that. But those monsters can hardly be considered peaceful. Even Godzilla. So once Children's Land is done, we'll destroy Monster lsland. - Destroy it? - That's right. We'll wipe it from the face of the Earth. Shukra, the dreaded homework monster... and Mamagon, the strict-mom monster. Come in. Congratulations! You got the job! The director loves your ideas. The director? Oh, that putz? Putz or not, you need the work. lsn't there anything else? Gengo, you're in no position to be choosy. l don't like the feeling there. They like you, and they pay well. What's your problem? - The peace thing. - Peace? Them and their "absolute peace." lt's a nice idea. Hey, what's that? Stuff they want first thing tomorrow. But what is it? Shukra and Mamagon. Mamagon? l note a certain resemblance. So l'm a monster? "World Children's Land Committee Office... fifth floor." Hey, you dropped something! Don't just stand there. Where did she go? - Who? - The girl! What did she do? Which way did she go? Hello? Hurry up and get in here. ln where? To your right. Don't bother knocking. Come closer. Who are you? My name's Gengo Kotaka. Ah, the director mentioned you. - And you are...? - The chairman. Something wrong? No, l'm just a bit surprised. l don't see any reason to be. What's that? The orbit of M Space Hunter Nebula. What? Nothing. lt's just - Chairman, l'm sorry. - She got away? - We'll find her, l swear! Losing that Action 2 tape throws a serious wrench in our plans. What's the Action 2 tape? lt contains the next stage of our plan. So that girl was an industrial spy? Much worse than that. An enemy of peace. - An enemy of peace? - That's right. We're striving to bring absolute peace to the whole world. Please hand over that tape! Tape? l know you picked it up! But it's not yours, is it? Get the tape. - lt's not on him. - What? What did you do with it? Where is it? Speak up! He fainted! Did he really think this was a gun? Hold on there! We're not crooks. - But your pistol - - Pistol? You mean this? Forgive us. We should have explained first. l'm really sorry. l'm Shosaku Takasugi. Machiko Shima. Pleased to meet you. l never heard of crooks introducing themselves. - We're not crooks! - Then enemies of peace. That's Children's Land, not us! Children's Land? Okay, let's hear your story. My brother, a computer technician, was working there. At Children's Land? But he hasn't been home for three days. So l went there... and they said he'd violated his contract by taking an unapproved leave of absence. He'd been acting really strange. l thought he was just tired from overworking, but then l read his diary. - What did it say? "l've made a dreadful discovery. Children's Land is an enemy of peace." And there are two mysterious tapes - lncluding the one you dropped? That's right. l bet they realized he was on to them and locked him up. Where? That's what we're trying to find out. So where's that tape? - l don't have it. l left it in a train station locker. Leave those there. Shima... don't try anything funny. Me? You're the ones holding me captive. You're not our captive. lt's just a little overtime. You're holding me prisoner! Our timetable has changed. We must work faster. You'll thank us one day. - Thank you? - That's right. There's no system like this anywhere on Earth. When you're finished here, you'll be the world's foremost authority on electronics. Chairman! Listen! Someone's playing the Action 2 tape! This is bad! Who the hell are you people? - What is this? - Maybe it's the wrong speed. l can't make heads or tails of it. lt stopped! lt reached the end. Now what? We'll have to change the computer program. Shift the plan into high gear. Those humans can't possibly understand what the tape means. But the monsters on Monster lsland do. HEY, ANGUlRUS! YEAH? GO SEE WHAT'S UP! HURRY! Hi there. - What were you doing? - Looking for you. l brought you my designs. lt's my brother's! Look! His initials! - What's his name? - Takashi Shima. - Where did you find this? - Godzilla Tower. Was he all right? l didn't see him, but l'll bet he's there. lt'll be tough finding him. This gets fishier by the minute. What's this "absolute peace" crap? Yeah, that's the big question. And there's something really strange about their chairman. He looks a little too young for that title. And he works on advanced math like it was nothing. He's beyond a whiz kid or genius. You know the problem he was working on? The orbit of M Space Hunter Nebula. M Space Hunter Nebula? - You've heard of it? - Huh? No, why would l have? So Godzilla Tower is our only line of inquiry right now. Now that you bring that up... Well, this is embarrassing. What is? We haven't even looked into the basics of this case. So you need more information? Exactly. Every investigation begins with background checks. But we haven't looked into anything about Children's Land. Right! So we need more information on the chairman and director. Then let's split up and see what we find. JAPAN KOSHlN PUBLlSHlNG THE MAlNlCHl NEWSPAPERS Here's what l got. Children's Land is part of the lnternational Children's Federation. Children's Land is funded entirely by private donations, but it never accepts money with strings attached. And the federation itself isn't involved in for-profit enterprises. - Children's Land isn't for-profit? - That's what's fishy. - Where is its headquarters? - Switzerland. That sounds suspicious. - What have you got? - l looked into Mr. Kubota. - ls he a foreigner? - No. His family register says he's Japanese. He was born in Yamano. Yamano? That chairman kid was born there too. His name's Fumio Sudo. He's 1 7 years old. Could be a coincidence. l don't believe in coincidences like that. - Me neither. - Let's check it out. How much further to Yamano? About 25 miles. Another hour without traffic. SUDO RESlDENCE This is the chairman's house. Sounds like a funeral. Hello? Anyone home? Hello. Sorry to bother you. May l help you? We've come to inquire about a Fumio Sudo. - Fumio? - Yes. Where is he now? He isn't here. So he's in Tokyo? What are you gentlemen talking about? Fumio died a year ago. Today is the first anniversary of his death. lt can't be! Visitors? They say they've come to see Fumio. l'm afraid that's impossible. He's gone to a better place. We just saw him in Tokyo! lmpossible! l said the proper prayers. His spirit is resting peacefully. You must have the wrong guy. Would you happen to have a picture of him? - lf you wouldn't mind. - Of course. What sort of fellow was this Fumio you met? He's the chairman of Children's Land. Children's Land? ls that a country full of kids? No, it's a theme park. Fumio is extremely brilliant. He solves equations that stump even math professors. Then you've got the wrong guy! Just between you and me... Fumio was always the class idiot. These are the only pictures l could find. Who's this next to him? That's Mr. Kubota. He was Fumio's junior high English teacher. The two of them died exactly one year ago today climbing Mount lkari. That reminds me... l must be off to Mr. Kubota's house for the one-year memorial. So they've been dead a year. What the hell is going on? We've received a message from M Space Hunter Nebula. Feed it through the translator. "Changes approved. Prepare for arrivals." We have our orders. Commence transmission of Action 1 tape. - Wait! - Keep out of this. What's that tape? The peace tape. Peace? Peace for whom? Anguirus has entered Sagami Bay! Defense Forces, deploy immediately! Halt! Dismount! Take your positions! Spotlights! Open fire! Chairman... what should we do with Shima? Now that we know the earthlings' capabilities, he's of no further use. Mr. Shima? Who's there? Are you Mr. Shima? Yeah. What are you doing here? l've been looking all over for you. Boy, my legs have had it! This isn't my office. l'm new. l'm still learning my way around. What brings you here so late? l wondered what you thought of the designs l gave you yesterday. ls that all? What do you mean? You said you wanted them in a hurry. Those designs are my best work ever. l'm sure of it. You have no business at this construction site. You should only report to my office. Now go. Yes, of course. Right away. l'll see you tomorrow at your office. Hold it. Cigarettes? Enjoy. Thanks. l will. What do you make of him? Foolish... yet cunning. A rare specimen for our collection. lt's true. Your brother's locked up in Godzilla Tower. Did you see him? No, the door was locked. But l managed to talk to him. So you're all in on this, huh? How did you find us? l placed micro transmitters in those cigarettes. So that's it! You thief! That woman there is the thief. She stole this tape from us. You've stuck your noses where they don't belong. What are you gonna do? Good evening. What are you - Mr. Kubota? - Are you people insane? - We're as sane as can be. You must investigate Godzilla Tower! - lt's urgent! Would you care to explain? lt's complicated. Her brother is being held prisoner there. lt's true! We found his lighter there. Monster lsland Control Center has just informed us that Godzilla and Anguirus have broken out and are headed for the Kanto area. All units stand by! Receiving pilot signal from M Space Hunter Nebula. Good. Synchronize guidance beams. Yes, sir. Project phase 1 is complete. Excellent. We've been waiting for this day. We came to this planet in search of eternal peace. Now it all comes to fruition. Proceed to the next phase. Look! They switched the lights on up there. l think your brother is locked up in that room. No sign of any guards. We're going in. You two stay here and proceed with the next step. They're less likely to spot us on the stairs. All clear. l can't go on! l thought you were a man! - Hurry! - Thank you! You should consider yourselves very lucky. Why is that? We planned to kill you outright... but plans have changed. lt looks bad. lt's been over ten minutes. You think they were caught? Could be. Time for Plan B. You will be used as disguises for our reinforcements arriving shortly. - Disguises? - That's right. Are you wearing disguises now? We're projecting images of the people we're impersonating. We've tried many experiments... but you humans are ideally suited to our purpose. Just what the hell are you? Very well. l'll explain. Look out there. ln the vastness of space... your planet isn't the only one of its kind. There are countless others like it. Our planet in M Space Hunter Nebula numbered among them. ln fact, conditions there surpassed those here on Earth. A species similar to your own dominated the planet and prospered. But they went extinct after two billion years... because of their reckless ambition. Even now, 1 00 million years later, the atmosphere is still polluted and devoid of oxygen. lt's a toxic world, a radioactive wasteland. You may not believe me... but your Earth is following the exact same path. Though your doom is still far in the future... you are headed inevitably for the same end. Even if the human race dies out, other species will survive, just as we did. We took over our planet and prospered. But planets have life spans too. Ours won't last much longer. That's why you've come to Earth? Conditions here are quite favorable. But certain changes are in order. We'll establish peace our way. Peace? For whom? For our species, of course. And what species is that exactly? One that can survive under the worst conditions. Switch to emergency power! A cockroach! Now you see what l meant by image projection. Commander! Two unidentified objects approaching Earth at Mach 400! Activate the photosonic receiver. lt's two space monsters. One is King Ghidorah. l can't identify the other. l've never heard it before. Defense Forces, deploy immediately. Look: the two space monsters. The one with three heads is King Ghidorah. And that's Gigan. They're being controlled... by the signals on these tapes. King Ghidorah and Gigan will serve us according to the plans encoded on those tapes. They'll now commence destruction of Tokyo and vicinity. HURRY! MOVE lT! FASTER! Our peace plan is proceeding exactly per our calculations. You think Machiko and Shosaku are okay? Absolutely! This was all part of my plan. That's what worries me. His ideas never - Enough bickering! We've gotta fight these guys. Now the latest news on the monsters. The two space monsters that caused widespread damage are approaching the coast. Port facilities and industrial complexes are being destroyed this very moment. Chairman! Godzilla just showed up. That's part of the plan. We'll lure him to our tower and destroy him. Gengo, look down there! Good. They know we're here. Okay. The string. Hook it to that pipe. Hurry. Here l go. Be careful. Takashi, are you okay? The car's over there. Hurry! The humans escaped. You fools! Activate the targeting system. We could have been fried back there! Our decoy tactic worked. As technology advances, reliance on machines keeps growing. They're a prime example of what that leads to. Exactly. We don't need machines. Let's use the feet we were born with. Godzilla is heading this way. According to plan. Are the laser beams ready? Ready, sir. Watch this. Once we defeat Godzilla, our victory will be assured. They're not human. They're insects from another planet. Monster cockroaches from space! What would you have us do? We've tried everything. But it's had no effect! - Godzilla is our last hope. - Godzilla is in danger! We must destroy the tower's control room before they fire the laser. lf we attack Godzilla Tower, King Ghidorah and Gigan will leap to its defense. Rocket bombardments have no effect on them. l know. That's why we must strike from within. - From within? - That's right. Where they're most vulnerable. They're so confident of their external defenses, they won't see it coming. What do you propose? Fire laser beams! Godzilla's in trouble! Let's go! Hurry! Run! Look. Godzilla is finished. - The elevator's coming up! - Go... and shoot to kill. ls everything in place? We did it! Kubota... where are you? l'm... right here. What happened? Our technology... our grand plan... Where did they go wrong? What happened? - ls Godzilla all right? - l don't know. But the space monsters are free of the aliens' control. Godzilla's back on his feet! Godzilla won! He did it! Godzilla Tower is history. Peace isn't so easily achieved. Technological advances make our lives easier while peace slips ever further from our grasp. - What is it? - A bug! Maybe they were right. Maybe cockroaches will inherit the Earth. They just might. Godzilla and Anguirus are going home! Good-bye! Come on, let's go Peace is calling His work won't be done Till he has crisscrossed the globe He has his targets in his sights He'll defeat the evil monsters With his enormous body and droopy eyes Tomorrow he'll fight again That's our Godzilla Go get 'em! That's our Godzilla THE END
