Mr President of the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons, Dr Ernesto Sábato. Ladies...and gentlemen. I believe that what you've done... already has a place in our country's history. It's a fundamental contribution, so, moving forward, we Argentines can certainly know, at the very least, the path we must never take, in the future. So that hate, so that violence, may never again disturb, unsettle, and degrade our society. AFTER MORE THAN 7 YEARS OF THE MOST MONSTROUS DICTATORSHIP IN ITS HISTORY, DEMOCRACY RETURNS TO ARGENTINA. Let's go. That's done. I've left it to stand. Alex! Everyone, up against the wall! Hands in the air! Legs wide apart. You'd better do as we say! Knock the door down! Move! Get downstairs! Go! Get a move on! Come on walk! Where is she? From the south wing of his residence, addressing the people of Argentina, His Excellency, the president of the nation, Lieutenant General Don Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri. The Battle of Port Stanley has ended. Our soldiers have fought with supreme effort for our nation's dignity. Those who fell... will forever live on in our hearts, and in the great history of the Argentinean people For not only do we have our past victories, we also have our heroes. Men of flesh and blood, here in the present. Names that will be carved by ourselves, and generations to come. United, the people of Latin America... You have been privileged witnesses to the most harsh circumstances in combat... In this ceremony, I hereby express my appreciation for your heroism and bravery in the line of duty. To Argentina! - No thanks. - From next week, we'll be good to go. Good. - Thank you. - Thank you, Commodore. How's Epifanía doing? - Very well. - The kids? - Fine... - Good to see you, Arquímedes! - Commodore! How do you do? - I'm very well. - Do you have some time to spare? - For you, always. Perfect. Let's meet tomorrow. We'll firm things up over the next few days. - Excellent. - If you'll excuse me, Puccio. Gordon... How do you do, Colonel... Come on! Push! To your left! Push! Play the ball! Come on! Come on, Alex! Well done, Alex! - Well done, kid! - Thank you! - Great game! - Alex! Well done, Pumas! Alejandro! Good game! The Pumas are looking good! - Great game, Alex! - Thanks! Did you enjoy it? - Yes. - Glad to hear it. Well done, Alex! Alex. These are the managers I talked to you about. Cool! Today we party, boys! Where's my whisky? Benito! That's Ricardo Manoukian! This is Ricky... - Alex! Long time no see. - Yeah! Sandra and Sonia. Friends of mine. Hey! How are you doing? Open bar! No! The girls will not be drinking! I smell a killjoy... But we can always keep it going at my place... Hey, dude! Fancy running into you! What are you doing here? I ran out of petrol. My car's ten blocks away. Can I get a lift? Sure. Hop in. - Dude! - Thanks. Glad I'm not the only one that happens to. A couple of weeks ago, after you left the party with the twins, these Scandinavian girls showed up... Make a left here. From Denmark or Sweden... They were really tall! So I was driving them to my dad's boat. I'm using it while I work for him... So far so good, up to that point. - This way? - Turn left here. They wanted to go sailing and were up for partying on the boat, when I ran out of petrol! - Freeze! - Does he have a gun? - Freeze, damn it! - Put the hood on! - Hey! Put the gun down! - Put the hood on! - Get out of the car! - OK. - Get out! Hands in the air! - Steady on! We haven't done anything! - Walk! - Please don't hurt me! Shut it! Walk! - Where are you taking me? Walk! Shut the hell up! - Head down! - Where are you taking me? Head down and get in, damn it. But we haven't done anything! Head down! Get in! Are you OK? Alex? I'm fine, Dad. THE CLAN - These were my fifth-year students... - But we've practised these... I'll be up early tomorrow. I've got two extra classes. Here you have to find the common denominator. Which one is it? - Twelve. - So it goes here. You must know that. And where would that be? - New Zealand. - Really? Cool! If you go, you'll see Maguila. Yes! Really cool! If you do see him, ask him how he managed to forget us all so easily. And about all the trouble we went to for him to be able to travel. He was just saying, Dad. And so was I? Why would that bother you? I'm not complaining. Quite the opposite, I'm worried. Maybe the poor bugger lost his memory... and didn't mean to just leave us here. Alone with all of this. He wanted to be a player and make his own way. Make his own way... Where did you read that? What do you think your brother is? A winner? A hero? An ace? Don't get confused! He's an ungrateful so-and-so. The first chance he got, he turned his back on us. Cause he abandoned all of you, too. Not just me. Alex! - Good thing I told you to come early. - Well, I'm here now. - Could you be any later? - I'm here now. I need you lot to help me, Alex. Here. I mean it! Mum, can you tell Her Ladyship to help me? She needs to do her homework and I've got exams to mark. - Let's go, Adri! - Coming, Mum. What you guys did was amazing! I don't understand why we don't appreciate our own. I mean... we had to travel to South Africa and beat the Springboks to prove we're the best! Unbelievable! You were real heroes. Took our flag to the top! Don't put too much salt on the potatoes... Unforgettable! You should hang a Pumas poster up in here. Right here! Those are the real heroes. National heroes. Give my regards to your family. Thanks, Alex. Hello? I have the duty of informing you that Ricardo Manoukian has been kidnapped by the National Liberation Front. As the hostage's family, you should refrain from contacting the police, if you want to see him alive. Yes, but is he all right? I must warn you, your phones have been bugged, Our organisation's logistics allow us to keep the hostage for an indefinite period of time. - Does it hurt? - All day long. The students really take it out of me. Now we've got exams coming up... - You're so tight! - Right there! You're so good with your hands. Aren't I lucky? Thanks. Is it OK like that? What if he starves to death...? Better now? Feet, Alex. - Help your mother. She's tired. - Coming. - When's dinner? - Your mum's just getting it ready. - What's for dinner, Mum? - Chicken with rice. - Come on, Alex! - It's almost over, Dad! Adriana... - Adriana! - What? - Dinner's almost ready. - OK. Calm down. It's dinner time. Hello! I repeat: the ransom is $500,000, in one hundred-dollar bills. This is your only choice. Is that clear? The ransom must be paid in dollars. You'll be told where to meet in due course. On your marks... Let's go, Oso. Push! Engage! Come on, let's go! They treat me very well. If you follow the instructions, the outcome will be satisfactory. Money comes and goes... ...but life doesn't. - Come on, come on! - Come on, come on! Push, Oso! Push! Let's write something a bit more sentimental... I really love you, Dad... I'm sorry for all the times I never said I loved you. Push! Push! - Defence, come with me! - Good job, guys! - What is it? - Nothing. You keep clashing with them. Do you want to get hurt? What's your strong suit? - Running. - Well, then... Step in and break the opposite way. And don't breath through your mouth. - Maybe he went on a trip... - No! I'm telling you... It's been more than a week since anybody heard from him. When I drop by, his family won't answer the door. - Have you tried calling him? - Loads of times. When they answer, they can't wait to get me off the phone. - That's strange. - It's not strange. Ricky's been kidnapped. - No way! - By the military? - What was he up to? - Nothing! It's not the first time it's happened to their family. So, you mean to say they've got Ricky, too? Bit of a coincidence... All right, Arquímedes? How are you? Mateo... - Hey! - Hi, Alex. What's with the long faces? - Ricardo's been found... - And? They killed him. What do you mean they killed him? They abandoned his body in the countryside. He'd been shot three times. The family paid the ransom, but they killed him anyway. They can't have done! They have. - Are you sure it was Ricardo? - Yes! His brother had to go and identify the body. Take it easy. We're going to the wake. - Can I have more meat, Mum? - Of course you can. - This tastes so good, Mum. - It is. I'm glad you like it, girls. - Do you like it? - It's very tasty. Aren't you hungry? That's enough. Thanks. It's really good. Thanks, son. - Clear the table! - I'm going to. Alex. Here you go. - Finish clearing the table. - Yes, in a minute! Can you look what you're doing? Things got complicated. We had no option, Alex. That boy wasn't fooled by your act, in the car. He lost it. We asked him to calm down. Told him it was in his interest to shut up, otherwise we'd shut it for him. That only made it worse. He threatened us. He said he'd tell his father's powerful friends and destroy us all. You... ...me... the girls... I'm not prepared to put our family at risk, Alex. We had no other choice. Laborde had to shoot him. There'll be new job opportunities soon. Trust me, son. I pray to God I won't let you down. Read the rules... See! It's what the rules say! Enough, kids! It's bed time! How many times do I have to ask? - Who's winning? - Me. - Only because you're cheating. - Whatever... - Hey... - Come on, throw! I'm not playing if you're going to cheat... Why can't you play without fighting? Don't try to resist. Keep walking! Come on! Keep walking! Where do you keep the weapons? - Tell me where you keep them! - I don't know... Basualdo! Search over there. All clear, sir. Keep moving, Ordóñez! Here she is! Call a doctor, Basualdo! Come here, Ordóñez. Take care of her. MARCH 1983 Will this interfere with his training? He'll need to spend time here. - I mean, he's got to be here... - He'll make it work. - Congratulations! - Thank you! This is for you! Alex! Just a couple of questions... All right, all right. But take it from over there. ...magazine covers... Are you proud of Alex? Let's drink to Alex! To Alex! Congratulations! Stop it! Enough! - All right? - Yes. Let's get one for you to remember this special moment by. Look at me and smile! And one of Alex with his dad, please. Yes! There you go. Look at the camera. ...this business with the IMF is part of the political landscape in this country, in which, given the state of our institutions, the country cannot make any progress, owing to the fragility of our institutions. Far more troubling than this business with the IMF, is the news that apparently, the leak of foreign currency has exceeded two billion dollars, this year I've been dating Florencio Aulet's mother-in-law for some time now. I was accepted into the family right from the start. They really trust me. I offered to put him in contact with the army's weapons suppliers. If my intervention was successful, and a deal was closed, I'd get a commission. I put them in contact, negotiations went ahead... But in the end, I never got a penny. After that, it happened again. With a petrochemical company this time. Once again, I was just tossed aside. Those deals were closed thanks to me. Do you know what I'm saying? These are the bastards who are bringing this country down. Who've sold it down the river. That's why they live this way. They're headed for the beach and will stay for three weeks. Or maybe more... Every time Don Florencio takes his family out on the boat, I house-sit for him. Does the son always go with them? They always go together. They're a close-knit family. - How long have they had the boat? - Around...five years. When can we see inside the house? With them gone, anytime you want. It's 271 cm long and 60 wide. - It's really nice. - Do you sail? Yes, for two years now. I'm learning. I'm about 150 pounds. Will it hold ok? Sure. It's good for up to 205 pounds. - Roughly 105 litres. - Fine. It's to use on the river, so it'll be just right for me, won't it? - Sure. - What's it made of? - Excuse me. What's it made of? - Epoxy. - It looks like Nacho's, doesn't it? - Yes. - Why don't I leave you to think about it? - OK. - Give me a shout if you need me. - Thanks. Can I help you? I need a wetsuit for windsurfing. I had a 4/3 in mind... 4/3... Right... You see, I don't think the 4/3... is for you. You look like someone who feels the cold easily. And with that wind out there, you're gonna need a 5/4 at the very least. I never feel the cold. This is the one for you. I'll tell you what... Try it on. If you like it I'll give you a 20 per cent cash discount. Over there. You have to try the new boards we got last week. - Feel like you're flying, on one of those. - I've already got one. - Really? - A slalom model. - Been surfing long? - Yes. Ages. - Would you give me a hand? - Sure. Ready? It's perfect. Sales are double what we'd anticipated. I saw an ad in the local paper. Loved it. - Nice one, Mum. Did you see it, Dad? - No. We've got people coming in from all over. We'll have to branch out soon. That's great! - Let's get you to bed. - Go to bed, love. - See you in the morning, Daddy. - All right. - Goodnight, Sil! - Goodnight, shrimp. Look, we're considering a new job. Florencio Aulet. I know his son. Eduardo. - Do you see him often? - No. - He drops by the club sometimes. - What else do you know? He's mad about rugby. He's a Pumas fan. Alejandro, I want to know what else you know. The same as everyone else, Dad. That they're loaded. Listen. It's really important that you pay attention during any future encounters. So...this is the living room. I want you to find out who they have dealings with and why. - Anything else? -That's it for now. I'll keep you posted. And that's the piano Don Florencio plays. He's a quiet man. Anything for an easy life. He won't give you any trouble. Oh, no. This is our guest, here. What? But... That wasn't the plan! What plan? I don't have a plan as yet. But it's the old man who's loaded! And he's a crook to boot. Listen, Puccio. Eduardo's like a son to me. We're very close. This is getting out of hand. I'll get found out. The closer you are to the kid, the better it is for us. Here's what you're going to do. You're going to meet with the family and you're going to tell them that you were kidnapped the night before and that you were used as bait to reel in their son. You'll say that you had no choice but to comply with a terrorist's command. - Anything else, Dad? - You get off, son. Fucking bastard! Fucking brat! Stay put, you son of a bitch! Up you go, you bastard! Quiet in here today. - There he is. - Alex! - How's it going? - So nice to see you! - Likewise. - I'm so glad you could make it. - Monica, Gonzalo. - How are you? I have the best table ready for you. Follow me. - Thank you. - This way, please. - Winning the lottery? - Cold... - Opening a clothes shop. - Freezing! Nothing bores me more than shopping. - Come on. Try harder. - Let me think... Entertaining at kids' parties? Warm... I've got it! - Opening your own kindergarten. - Hot! That's the business that's gonna help me achieve my dream. - My dream is to live in Sweden. - Sweden? Wow! That's far away. Where? Kalmar. The city where my grandparents are from. Across from Gland. A beautiful island. - So you've been there before? - Never! But my mum says it's perfect for summer holidays. It's quieter and... things are much more routine than they are here. Kalmar... I like the name. - May I propose a toast? - To what? Our organisation is not willing to negotiate proof of life. You'll receive a letter written by your relative, attached to the instructions that you'll follow, to the letter, to ensure his release. Like it? You're going to write a letter to your family, telling them that you are all right. Ready? Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop...! Now write... Dad... don't worry, they're treating me just fine. Tell Roly not to worry, and that I love her. Now, it's all up to you. - Like this? - Mm-hm. Good. I don't get it, Dad... Are you all right, love? - Yes. - Haven't you had supper? Let me show you how it's done... What's the matter? Work out how many go into 42. I have to go out. I'll be back in a bit. - I'm going to bed, Mum. - Oh, Sil... - Can you check my English homework? - I've already got lots to mark! - All right, I'll have a look at it. - Thanks. - Good night. - Sweet dreams. Night-night, Guille. In order to pay the ransom you must follow the instructions given, to the letter. Let me remind you of the sum. One million dollars in hundred-dollar bills. I'd advise you not to commit any traffic offences. And no looking in the rear-view mirror. Failure to abide by these orders... could put both your own lives and that of Eduardo at risk. Here they are. I can't see him! He's not here! They'll never leave here. Start handing them to me. Perfect. Take a seat, please. I'd like to thank you. It's very reassuring having you with me, at times like this. You've been really good. Congratulations. This is yours. Take it easy, now. It's a lot of money. Thank you. Have you got a bag I can put it in? We're the police. Don't worry. It's all over now, miss. We're the police. It's all over now. - Did you know someone was in there? - I've no idea what you're talking about! - How long has she been down there? - Put your gun down! I don't know! We're almost done... Just a little longer... Do you know the lady in the basement? Please, let me go! Do the names Manoukian or Aulet mean anything to you? - How long was that lady downstairs? - Don't touch my kids! How long's she been down there? Just relax, miss. Here you go... The Commodore is on his way. It's the beginning... of an era... which, without a doubt, will be hard... DECEMBER 1983 Because... we all have... the enormous responsibility... ...of ensuring, today, and for all time, democracy and respect for human dignity throughout the land! Alfonsín! Alfonsín! Alfonsín! Alfonsín! - Good morning. - Morning. I need to see the Commodore. You already told me that on the phone and I've already explained to you. That's why I'm here. I'm not happy with your explanation. Listen, Puccio. I really don't have time for this. Am I not making myself clear? I want to see the Commodore. Things aren't looking too good. You'd do well to stay under the radar for a bit. This government's up to all sorts. There's no telling what'll happen next. Do as I say. Lay low. - I'll show you the way out. - Lay low? - This way... - I know my way out. - Did you see the news? - No. What happened? They got Aníbal Gordon and his gang. - Who? This son of a bitch who lost his job once the military were no longer in power. He started kidnapping people himself. It seems Pato Rizaro, a guy from the suburbs, was part of his gang. Unbelievable! Fucking son of a bitch! I'm sure they're the ones who killed Ricky. STATE INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT - In you go. - Thank you. - Good morning. - Just go right through, sir. Gordon. I couldn't believe it when I heard. How are you? Nothing stays the same, Arquímedes... These things go in cycles. I got caught because I was stupid. Because I let that useless idiot Kelly live. He's got a big mouth and he had intel on this military chap. Good intel. First-hand. His wife was threatening to take it to the press, go to court... All sorts. The Commodore called me... ...and ordered me to let him go. Like a fool, I let him go. I'm fine, though. You know how these things work. Remember Bonafide? Back in '73? How long were we in for? How long did it take them to sort things out. Three months? More or less... For the time being, the bosses will have new faces, but it'll all be back to normal soon. How long can a democratically-elected government last? I mean, come on. I give it two years, tops. I don't know what to do next, though. Seize the moment of euphoria. Turn the military's discredit to your advantage. Find new guests... People with something to hide. For instance, like doing business with the military. You have to really pay attention. Be really careful. Make yourself less conspicuous. Provide hospitality for third parties. That's always been your strong suit. I like the suede ones. The pair you requested, sir. Excuse me. Do you have the suede ones in a size nine? - Yes, of course. I'll just get them for you. - Thanks. Arquímedes Puccio. How do you do? - Emilio! How are you? - Fine. - Emilio Naum, my son Alejandro. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. - The pleasure's mine. I've seen you in all the magazines. I'm a huge rugby fan. - Shopping? - No, just passing. Business has me all over the place. - You can't complain, eh, Emilio! - Things are going pretty well. I spend my time between Buenos Aires and Uruguay. - We've opened several shops over there. - You don't say. - Still flying? - Yes. I have a new Cessna Citation. It's the best! Have whatever you want. On me. - No way. Thanks, but I can't accept. - Arquímedes, please. - No. Thank you, but, really, I can't. - I'm hurt. - Well... - Alejandro, talk to your father... - He knows what his father thinks. - Alejandro is saying yes. Relax. You'll be fine. Don't let the pressure get to you. You have to control it and not the other way round. - Yeah. There's a lot going on... - It's just a tour, that's all. Just a few matches. It's not a matter of life and death. - And what about you? - What? - What are you going to do? - About what? What's with the hug? - I'm not coming back, Alex. - Eh? I can't stand it anymore. I'm scared. - You're not coming back where? - Home. How much longer do you think it'll be before we get caught? - What you're doing is insane... - What do you mean "not coming back"? Well, what about you? You can't just stay at home. - For God's sake, leave! - What's going on, guys? - Come on, Guille! Are you scared? - Do we need to take Alex with us? - Please, get out of there! - Let's go, Guille! Stop whining! Go, Alex. Bye, Alex! - Cheers! - Cheers. - What's wrong? - Nothing. It's just that you look so... I'm just a bit tired. Do you want to eat here or somewhere else? - Let's just finish this, then go elsewhere. - All right. - You sure you're OK? - Yes, love. This is going to take another couple of weeks, at least. We're building concrete walls, one foot-thick. The builder's really good. He'll do a good job. - Any questions? - When's it gonna be? Ideally, on Thursday. Alejandro is training all the other days. - Here are your cold drinks. - Thank you. Don't forget, I've got a staff meeting. - I'll leave everything ready for supper. - Thanks. - See you. - Bye. Now pay attention. Alejandro and I will be standing on the kerb. As Naum approaches, we'll intercept him and tell him the car's conked out and ask him if he could take us to a mechanic's. Once we're in Naum's car, we start riding, we make small talk. Then, once we get to the corner, I ask him to stop. Because I've just remembered that I left my keys in the car. At that moment, you lot get out of the Chevy, go over to the driver's seat, get him out, then take him away. Then, Alejandro and I will go back to the Ford, then leave. And then we all meet back here, at home. - Any questions? - No. Alejandro, you haven't said a word. Any questions? No. - Any doubts? - No. I said I'm sorry. How many times have I told you not to leave your brushes in the kitchen? - I've been working all night, Mum. - Yes, all right. - But use the sink in the laundry room. - I'll be done in a second. How much more of my time do you want? All right, that's it. I'm off. What is it? I'm not going tomorrow. - What? - I can't, Dad! Why are you telling me this now? I've included you in all of this and now you're having doubts? Just when I'm starting to get somewhere and become a player, you want to abandon me? Dad, I'm going to get married! You've lost the plot, you have. What do you mean you're getting married? And this is how you tell us? - Isn't it all a bit of a rush? - No. Give your father time to process it. You know what he's like. I can't talk to him, Mum! Try to see it from his point of view. Getting news like that precisely at a time like this. He has no one to trust. It's hard for him without your help. Alex, my love... Why don't you go and see Maguila and convince him to come back? That'll calm him down. It'll make life easier for all of us. Thank you ever so... Oh, am I glad to see you, Naum. Fancy seeing you again. Everything OK? No. My car broke down. - Can I hitch a ride to the garage? - Sure. - Is it OK if my accountant comes too. - Yes, of course. - Thank you ever so much. - My pleasure. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. - Mr Laborde, Mr Naum. - How do you do? He's a very old friend of mine. - What's wrong with the car? - I'm not sure. It just gave up the ghost. - I think it could be the spark plugs. - Yes. - The battery, perhaps? - No, I replaced that a few days ago. But I don't know, because... Oh, I'm so stupid. I left the keys behind. Just stop here a second. I'll run and get them. I'll just make a U-turn. - No, no, no. I insist... - I can go, Arquímedes... - There's no need for you to walk. - Please, Naum. I'll go! - See? Done. - Really, Naum. There's no need... It's fine. - What's this guy up to? - This is what we're up to! Just take it easy. Everything's going to be fine. Don't hurt me! I have money in the briefcase. We don't want the money in the briefcase. Stay calm and you'll be fine. Calm down, Naum. It's worse if you don't. - Help! - What are you doing here, Díaz? - Son of a bitch! - Go back to the fucking car! Look, calm down, Naum. Don't say a word. Just stay here, just stay calm... What have you done? Go and get in the car. What the fuck was that, Diaz? Why did you come back? - Why did you make a U-turn? - He tried to bring us back. - You should have stayed in the car! - Why didn't you restrain him, arsehole? Don't call me an arsehole, dickhead! Slow down, Diaz. You're attracting attention. Take me to the car. And you, get rid of the gun. I'll take care of it. - Open up! - Hold on, Dad! - Now, you listen to me! - Dad, stop! Please! You bailed on us and things didn't go according to plan. - You're choking me, Dad. - Naum was killed, and it's your fault! I've never botched a kidnap before. We looked like a bunch of amateurs. We were completely exposed. Completely! And now, we're in grave danger. Is this how you wanted to get rid of your father? ls it? Is it? Hello, love. I missed you so much! - There he is! - Maguila! - He's a lot bigger, isn't he? - Yeah. He's really fat. Mum! Mummy! Come here, you two! And now, all three of you! Here you go. No...this one. This one's not for you. This one's for you. And this one's for you... - Maguila, this is Mónica. - Welcome! - Nice to meet you. - Thanks. Did you think I wouldn't come? - Welcome back, son. - How's it going, Dad? - Do you like it, Maguila? - Bravo! - Ready? - Let's go! This is so cool, Maguila! - All right, then. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - This meat looks good! - It's delicious, Mum! The money's good and the people are cool. But it's hard work. Shearing those bloody sheep is no joke because they don't put them to sleep. - You have to grab them with your hands... - What do you mean? - With your hands. Like this. Alex... - No! Come on... You start on the top and go all the way to the back, softly. All right, all right... See? That's how the sheep react, only ten times worse. - Isn't it dangerous? - Yes, very! Much more than rugby. Check this out. - It really takes it out of you. - So why didn't you come back? Lots of reasons. Alex helped me make a decision. I'd like to propose a toast. To Alejandro, to Mónica... It's great welcoming a new family member... - Cheers! - Welcome back! - Cheers. - Welcome back, son! - Cheers, Maguila. - Thank you. - Cheers. - What's wrong, Mum? I'm thinking of Guillermo. It's been more than a year since we heard from him. I really miss him. Take it easy, lady. Easy... Hold her head. Go, Dad, go! Tie her up tight. - Everything all right? - Yes. Well done, son. Well done. Get me out of here! - Maguila is back! - Yes! - Maguila! - How are you doing, guys? - Want your place on the team back? - It's been so long! You'd need to get back in shape. Look at you! - Welcome... - Come in, kids. Will you just look at these trees! They're really old. It's a really quiet neighbourhood. We've known the neighbours for ages. Delightful people. - The land belonged to my grandparents. - It was all one big estate. Then we sold it off in lots. This is the last plot left. We used to come here and play with our cousins. How big is the plot? Well it's about... It's approximately 18 metres wide and 50 metres long. I love it! It's perfect for you guys. - Nice, isn't it, Alex? - Yes. Bit big, though... Cheer up! We'll find a way to make it work! Nothing would make me happier than for you two to have the plot. You're like family to me, Alex. Get me out of here! Let me go! Stop it! Our only option is to take out a loan. We need further proof that my mother's alive. Otherwise, we won't keep negotiating. Unless you want to put your mother's life in grave danger, you must accept our terms and the amount we demand. If you harm my mother, you won't get a cent. I repeat, we need more... As usual, we'll honour the club's tradition by winning another championship. So, you guys need to keep pushing, both on and off the pitch. I'm very proud of this team. Now, go and take a lap. Alex, you stay here. Let's go! Let's go! - I need you to be at the top of your game. - Yes. Inspire the rest of the team. Now, go, champ. Go and see if it's Guillermo. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Who was it? - They hung up. - Bring the phone here, Adriana. I need order! Tell Adriana to come down and have her breakfast at once. The toast and the milk are cold, I can't wait any longer... - Calm down. - I am calm. - It's just that I have to go to work. - Well, then, go! It's unbelievable. That brat always gets away with things... No. Wait a minute, now... Let Her Ladyship know that her homework's been done. Morning, Dad. - Morning... - Morning. - Who is it? - It's me. Open up. - Are you alone? - What's with you? Can't you hear, Alex? They're shouting, for God's sake! Look, relax, OK? Just relax. Dad's down there. Everything's fine. - Cut the crap! I'm not stupid! - OK, but calm down... - Who's that screaming like that? - OK, I'll talk to Dad. But relax. - What's going on, Alex? - Calm down and go and have breakfast. - Good morning. - Good morning. Morning! Any news, Arquímedes? Lady, be quiet. That's all I ask of you. Get me out of here! They've been dragging their heels for three weeks now. I've no idea what's going on. They'll give in eventually. Relax. That's enough now, lady. That's enough. Give it a rest! - This can't go on, Laborde. - What are they telling you? That they don't have the money. I know they're not telling the truth. - This lady has serious digestive trouble. - Take that away. It makes my eyes sting. Here we are. What do you call that? Bye, Dad. - Puccio. - Who is this? You know very well who it is. Commodore! Why are you calling me at home? What kind of question is that? I was driving my daughter to school today and a car was tailing me. Are you following me? We've been taking a lot of flak over the disappearance of a sixty-five-year-old woman. Certain bigwigs are getting anxious. We need to get it sorted quickly. - What can you tell me? - You haven't answered me. Why... did you call me at home? Puccio. I'm the one who asks the questions. If I'm calling you, it's because I can't offer you any more protection. Am I being clear? Do you understand what I'm telling you? I can't talk right now. AUGUST 23, 1985 Let's go, Silvia. Wonders never cease! What are we celebrating? Booking the tickets for that trip I've been promising Moni. That's nice. We're also celebrating the new championship. - We need to win first! - Oh, you win every year, Alex. We're going out. Do you need anything? - You could get some dessert. - Sure! Adri, get the shopping trolley and let's get going. - Should I get drinks? - Yes. - Where are you going, Alex? - Sweden. To Kalmar. So far! - Are Maguila and your dad coming? - Yes, later on. Sounds good to me... Go. - Evening... - Fill her up. It's late. We're still on schedule. I've got people waiting for me at home. Me too. Police! Freeze! Police! Freeze! Hands in the air! Freeze, goddamit! Calm down! Take it easy! Get down on the ground, motherfucker! Are these your house keys? Are they? - Yes. - All right, then. Turn around! - Hands behind your back, damn it! - All right, all right! Stay put, you bastard! You stay put! Lift him up! You won't find anything. There's nothing there. I mean it. You really don't want to go to my house... It's all rigged with dynamite. You go in, the whole building goes up. Knock it off, you stupid old fool. - Now, let's go and find this lady. - You laugh, then. I'll have the last laugh. That's done. I've left it to stand. - Alex! - Hands in the air! Everyone, freeze! Up against the wall. Everyone! Come on! Up against the wall! It's all right, love. It's all right. We have a warrant to search the entire house. Where the fuck is she? Come on, knock that door down! There! Let's go down! Move it! - Keep moving, damn it! - What's going on, Alex? Keep walking! Is there anyone here? Basualdo, check in there. Come on, Ordóñez! Move it, move it! - Out with it! Where've you hidden her? - I don't know! See if you can move this... Here she is! Basualdo, get a doctor! - Ordóñez! Take care of her! - Now, listen to me, ma'am... Look at me, ma'am. We're the police. It's all right, it's all over now. Look at me, will you... Look at me, madam. Come here... Look! There she is! Do you know her or not? - Do you? - No, sir. - You knew nothing about this? - No, sir. - Really? - I swear, sir... It's all right, madam. We're the police. It's over now. It's all right... You did know, you piece of shit! I know you did. Sit there! It's over, madam. It's finished. You come with us... Alex! Moni! Be careful, girls... Alex, Moni! What's going on? Everyone, freeze! This is a police procedure! Go slowly into the living room. Into the living room. On the sofa. Keep moving! Keep your head down! Don't touch the girls! Not the girls! Move! You come with me! - Sit down! - Cuff her! - Do you know the lady in the basement? - I don't know what you're talking about! - How long has she been there? - Put the gun down! I don't know! - How long? - I don't know! Do the names Manoukian and Aulet mean anything to you? - Do you know the lady in the basement? - No! Leave my children alone! Do the names Manoukian and Aulet mean anything to you? Turn around! It's all right, madam. Here you go. The Commodore is on his way. - How longs she been down there? - I don't know! Tell me! How long's that lady been down there? Cordon the area off! Don't let anyone in! Where's Dad? Don't leave me here, Alex! Murderer! Alex! Get me out of here! What's going on, love? Alejandro! Tell us what happened! What can you tell us? Mum! Mum! - Get me out of here, Mum! - Calm down! - This lady will take care of you. - Mum, please! Does your dad have anything to do with this? What's happening, love? - Who is she? - This is nothing to do with you! - What was she doing in the house? - She's just a neighbour. Alejandro! What happened? Get us out of here, Dad! Get us out! - Don't worry. It's all right. - Arquímedes! They didn't bring Adriana. Where is she? - I'm talking to you. Where is she? - Calm down, calm down... What are we doing here, Dad? - It's going to be all right. - I can't take much more of this... We'll soon be out... Steady on! Everything's fine. Just calm down. I just want to know when I'm getting out of here. We no longer have the leverage we used to, and well you know it. - So for now, you'll have to face the music. - And then? We can provide the means to ensure you have a nice stay... Be patient, Puccio... After a while, once things have calmed down, it'll be easier to get you out. I promise you. - Francisco... - Please, come in. - Hang in there, Alex! - Everything's going to be fine. It's all going to get cleared up. You'll see... - What about Moni? - She got out this morning. Your mum and your sister are back home. Look after yourself. Be strong! My dad's gonna sort it all out. Chin up, mate. And screw you lot! It's OK, Alex. - I hear we won the championship. - Yes! We did! And we'll soon be celebrating together! - In you go, sir. - Thank you. Hello, Alex. I've brought you some clothes. How are you? Now, I want you to stay calm, please. Come in. The judge is ready. I've explained all of this before. Was I not clear? Our only option is to take out a loan. We need further proof that my mother's alive. Are you listening to me or not? If you harm my mother, you won't get a cent. I repeat, we need more time. Unless you want to put your mother's life in grave danger... These are the recordings of calls to the family of the kidnapped lady. And to the Mamoukian and Aulet families. The voice is the same on all of them. It's yours. What do you think? I was forced to do this, Your Honour. By a group led by two men, aged between 35 and 40. Part of an organisation. - What kind of organisation? - I've no idea. Like I said, I was forced into it. I don't know what their names are either. Just their code names. What did you do in that situation? I tried to resist as much as possible, Your Honour. But they beat me. They threatened to kill my entire family. I still don't have a lot of information, but I'm trying to call in a few favours. You have to be as strong and focussed as possible. When you're before the judge, you have to look him in the eye and assure him that you didn't have the slightest inkling of what was going on at home. Sir... Take it easy. Look after yourself. The evidence against you is conclusive. But you have the chance to save your family. The evidence against them isn't as incriminating. They could be charged with being accessories after the fact, given that no one living at that house could ignore what was going on. It's up to you to accept the charges, and declare that you were entirely responsible. I'm innocent. It's all a set-up and I'm the main victim. To protect the real, powerful culprit, Your Honour. Listen, Puccio... you must know that both Contempomi and Díaz have already testified against you. And they have implicated your sons. Tomorrow we'll bring everyone face to face, so that the truth can come to light. I'll say it again... Save your family. It's in your power. - What about Adriana? - Adri's fine. She's calmed down a lot. Hasn't she? We're all fine. Don't you worry. Dad's taking care of everything and he'll get you all out. Are you listening to me? Madam, please... Dad did it for us, Alex. Try to understand that. Look after Adriana. - I love you. - Me too. - Keep it short. - Yes. Love, please... Tell me you've got nothing to do with any of this. I'm innocent. Swear it. I swear. I knew it. I knew it. Come here, Gómez! Hey, Puccio! Hey, Alejandro! Come here, champ! Move it! Come on. Let's go. Come on! Move it! Get in here. - What do you want? - Sit. - What for? - Sit, Alejandro. I'm going to refuse to testify, tomorrow. I'm going to tell them that I've been pressured into confessing, illegally. I'm going to show them the marks on my face, as proof of the violence I've been subjected to. Which marks? The ones I'll have once you've hit me. You've got to hit me really hard. We'll say the wardens duffed me up. You're out of your mind. I'm out of my mind, am I? Aren't you going to do it? You'd let your father rot in jail, after all I've done for you? You're a traitor, Alejandro. You're so ungrateful. Why don't you just kill me? - You just want to save yourself? - That's enough, Dad. Let's get this straight, Alejandro... It's up to me whether you go free or not. What's it to be? You owe everything that you are to me. Did you ever stop to think about that? How do you think you became a hero? A Puma? It's because of me. All thanks to me. I planned it all. Step by step. Every choice. Since you were this high... And now you want to leave me in here? You're gonna wash your hands of me, as if you had nothing to do with it? If I fall, Alejandro, we all fall. We're all in the same boat, and you're as much to blame as the rest of us. You're a fake. A champ! A star! Are you gonna tell your friend Benito what you've done, to his face? And what about your friends at the club? On the national team? Will you tell them what you did and why? You did it for the money, Alejandro! For the money that I gave you with my own hands. - So take it like a man! - Shut up! I won't. You gonna tell your girlfriend where the money for the shop came from? To buy your plot of land? To have that comfortable lifestyle? You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! - Stop it! That's enough! - You son of a bitch! You piece of shit! You've ruined my life, you son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! You piece of shit! I'm gonna get you, too! You son of a bitch! Contempomi, you piece of shit! Diaz, you son of a bitch! Traitor! Just keep calm, Alex. Everything'll be fine. Alex! Alejandro survived the jump from the 5th floor and was sentenced to life in prison. His teammates stood by him and believed in his innocence for many years. Mónica visited him in jail until he asked her to stop. She started a new life. In prison, he attempted suicide several times, but failed to end his life. He died in 2008 at the age of 49. Alex! Call a doctor, please! Call a doctor! After 2 years in prison, Maguila was released because his sentence was still pending. In 1998, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison, but he fled. Rumour has it that he spent time in New Zealand, Australia, Brazil, and San Luis. In 2014, he appeared in court asking for a sentence exemption waiver and got one. Call a doctor! Alex! What are you doing here, you son of a bitch? Epifanía did time and was released in 1987, due to lack of evidence. Silvia spent some time in prison before her release. She died of cancer at 52. Adriana was taken into custody by her mother's family. Eventually, she returned to live with her mother. Guillermo was not accused of any crime. He never returned to Argentina and his whereabouts are unknown. Arquímedes Puccio was sentenced to life in prison. He got a law degree in jail and started to practise after his release in 2008. Until his death, at 84, he admitted no guilt for the crimes with which he was charged. No one from his family claimed his body and he was given a common burial.
