We humbly submit our judgment for that of the Supreme Pontiff. We allow our diocese in the Cult of Our Lady of Lourdes. and we intend to build him a shrine. I can not. I can not live separate from her. - All these incessant visits, and all curious. He had to protect her! The away. - I accepted. - And even she is still asser? - Distant? - Protected. - My mother. - Mother, this is how Bernadette am too. But Madame Sousbirous, neither you nor I are really his mother. - I know. I am not jealous. No, I .. I'm not jealous. It is recognizing you my Mother. Bernadette is a burden for you? But not at all! It helps to heal the sick, it makes the class very small. In small? - Yes, we see it a bit like one of us. - Already ..? Small music ... Mum.. ! I was afraid that this is still a bishop .. Ah, ah, had, had, ah (2 laugh a little and at the same time) ..! Small melodic music in the background .. Quick, quick Bernadette! Go quickly to the bell! Monseigneur de Nevers is within our walls. Bernadette.. Assisez you my child. Well? I am happy to see your face. And your hands? What you were not intimidated before the Mother of God and you would be in front of me? All in good time. And now my child, what do you get? - But nothing! - How nothing? But we must do something down here. Well I have lived for 4 years for dear Sisters. - No doubt but you can stay there only temporarily! - well I would stay still. Oh, oh. Easy to say, but less easy to achieve. - Why with my lord? - But because you are not Sister ..! And it is essential to be to be admitted permanently in a comunità. You are no longer a child Bernadette. Do you not be very happy to establish yourself in the World? - Oh, why not, for example. - So why you do not you Sister? Do you ever dreamed? Oh yes .. But it is not my lord, I am poor. I will never have the necessary dowry. sometimes accepts as Religious of poor girls without dowry when they have a real vocation!

It is the supreme rule of the Order ... - God alone .. - If you ask the Heart said to the Mother Superior and she gives notice to the Mother General. And I'll take care of the rest. - I'll think Bishop. But .. I'm not decided yet. Music... These are the Lord Bishop requirements. Upon his arrival here, we have to subtract Bernadette not only to public curiosity. The boundary wall and Sister door will take care. But still the admiration of his companions. - If we do not even hear from his mouth? - Yes, Mother Marie-Thérèse, once one. Tomorrow I assamblerai whole comunità. Bernadette will before her the story of his wonders. And nobody will never alluded to his presence. I you Mother Nathalie seems excessive. - Not my mother. But I think this Word of the Gospel. That no one lights a lamp to put on a bushel. - The lamp continues to burn, and it lit up the world. But in Lourdes, not here. Nevers is this background of darkness where the light comes off best. Mother Maria Theresa .. - My Mother. - I know you've told your novices, for me it will be the greatest happiness of my life. - To see the eyes that have seen the Virgin Mary. - I recommend you Nevertheless, and even .. I command you ... to consider Bernadette Sousbirous exactly the equal of any of your novices a .. among other ... - Mother, you're exhausted.
