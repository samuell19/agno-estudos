And now, here's Carnation's own contented couple, - George and Gracie. Thank you. Thank you very much. Gracie and I will be back again two weeks from tonight. - Say goodnight, Gracie. Goodnight. Good night. This concludes another day of service. And now, ladies and gentlemen, our national anthem. And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air In New York's Central Park, over a million citizens take time, as they do in similar gatherings across the face of the continent, to restate their allegiance on I Am An American Day. I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. An informed patriotism is what we want. A love of country and an appreciation of its institutions. Goal! "Being American is more than a pride we inherit It's the past we step into and how we repair it" And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night "We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it" You will not replace us! "History has its eyes on us "We've learned that quiet isn't always peace "We will not march back to what was but move to what shall be "A country that is bruised, but whole benevolent, but bold "Fierce and free "We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation" USA! USA! USA! Part of what makes this country special is that we respect people's rights to have a different opinion and to make different decisions about how they want to express their concerns. This anthem is our one tradition we all share as Americans. It represents our flag, our flag represents our country, and our country represents the men and women that fight to keep it free. I understand it's supposed to honor the country, but here's what people forget about the national anthem. It ain't original. It's based off a British song. 172 years ago, a Washington lawyer, Francis Scott Key, who was being detained by the British in Baltimore Harbor, looked across these waters and saw Old Glory still flying after long hours of British bombardment of Fort McHenry. He was inspired to write a poem set to the music of an old English song. That don't even make no sense. Imagine that. Imagine whoopin' another country's ass, getting your freedom, and then to celebrate your freedom you write a freedom song based on a song of the country's ass you just whooped? Patriotism is a film. Let's not forget that. Patriotism ain't no one song. If you want more people to stand for the anthem, change the song. Maybe start with all the film stuff. Do you have a set order for how those are gonna play? Yeah, it'll be Green Book, King Richard, When They See Us, and Bridgerton. Okay. Cool. Yeah. Thank you. - How does it look? Really good. - Yeah? - I like this lighting better. Yeah? Okay. Yeah. Because I do like the idea of people being able to see you. I think that they're here to see you. ...the artistic director here. And it's great to see you all. How you doing, Kris? Good. - This is going to be beautiful. Thanks. I'm looking forward to it. Incredible, watching the sound check. Oh, thank you. Go ahead. Kris Bowers is our great artist tonight. Someone with an extraordinary sort of résumé in film and television scoring. Bridgerton, Green Book, Respect. There's dozens, dozens more. He's one of the great young pianists of our time right now. So please give a warm welcome to Kris Bowers. Go, team. I started playing piano when I was four. Once I was able to learn how to improvise and express myself, especially, I think, being a young Black boy, all of the sudden, the piano became this vehicle for me. If I was angry or sad or, you know, any of these other feelings, I could play from that place on piano and kind of find a way to move through those feelings. And so, part of my process when I first get a film is I read through the script or I watch the film. I watch it a bunch of times. And I find a place that just emotionally moves me. And then, once I find that moment, I then go to the piano and just try to improvise around that feeling, seeking some sort of truth. I think that when you first came to me with this project, I was primarily focused on how globally influential the music that was created on American soil has been. And yet, the piece of music that we choose to represent us doesn't sound like that. And so, I immediately felt incredibly curious about the symbolic importance of the anthem for so many people. Is there any way to synthesize that into a piece of music with the effort of making this feel as inclusive as possible? Thinking of this task, it only made sense to travel through the country, and meet musicians that can teach us about these other genres that originated here. How's that? Can you hear me? There we go. - Yup. I think, on this road trip, we have to kind of like, you know, soak it in. The more I'm thinking about it, the more I'm getting excited about what it would mean to create a new anthem for America today. What is the American sound? What is the American voice? And sort of translating that into lyrics in a song. I think it would be good to have whomever we're able to get as a producer weigh in on that, just talking about what we're looking for when we go on this trip and everything. So, on the producer side, we've been talking a lot about DJ Dahi. I guess he's produced some of Drake's stuff. Yeah, he's a friend, too. He's super versatile. The thing I love about Dahi is he's... You would classify him as hip-hop producer, but he's like... He grew up listening to rock music just as much, if not more than hip-hop, and so, like, the sound of his production is really unique. He's also one of the greatest producers when it comes to like textures, things like that, sampling something and making it sound like something else. I've known him for a while, so I think he'd be down to help in some way. When you create music, you just have to know it has to connect to people. Co-production, I think, is really dope. And you just got to be open, you know? I mean, the song is the most important thing. It's not about me or the other person. It's about the song. I don't care about what I'm making being the biggest song. If it happens, it's great, but I just wanna make something that's, like, some type of emotional pull. Because a lot of times when you're making a song, you're really making a song for the future. My dad is from the Ivory Coast in West Africa. He moved here to have a better life and there was more opportunity. Seeing him hustling was kind of like the first time I really understood, "Oh, yeah, America is a place that people want to come to grow." He was determined to create a better life for himself and a better space for his family. And now that I'm in that position, I am worried about where the world will be when my son is able to kind of make decisions on his own. Sometimes you have to take a challenge just to see what you can do, so when Kris told me about the project, I was like, "Yo, I'm game, man." - My brother. - How you feeling? - What's good, man? - Not much. - Yeah. Welcome to the spot, man. - Man. So, man, what's up with this road trip, man? How are you feeling about it? I'm excited, to be honest. A little nervous. There's so much about being a kid from LA. This is what I know. Know what I'm saying? Either I'm in LA or I'm in New York. But, in general, like, I haven't really been kind of in the heart... of the country, know what I'm saying? So this is definitely a dream for me in that sense, and just learning about the history of music in this country and... Yeah, man. Just excited to learn, you know. - That's the main thing. - Yeah, totally. An anthem is a song that is designed to create a sense of unity, or a sense of identity. And so, it provides a way for a lot of different people to all connect to kind of a master story or a master narrative about a country. Quite often, national anthems grow from militarism and are used repeatedly within militaristic activities. In the case of The Star-Spangled Banner, Francis Scott Key wrote the lyrics after witnessing the attack on Baltimore by British ships in the War of 1812. In 1916, Woodrow Wilson, the president, signs a bill making The Star-Spangled Banner the official anthem of the US Military. And the rocket's red glare This is the first time in American history that people regularly stand for the anthem as a sign of respect. Part of the concern in the performance of the anthem is that if you do anything outside of the box, anything outside of the composition as it exists in the popular imagination, it is seen as an affront. It is seen as a protest. So, José Feliciano, for example, performed a more folksy version of the song, one that sounded very much like the period in which it was performed and released, which was 1968. ...early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars Through the perilous... For him, it was a sincere expression, but it struck people, particularly veterans, who were throwing their shoes at their television sets and lighting up the television network switchboards with complaints. Were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air I wonder, when I think about this version, like, who didn't like this song? - Yeah. - That's what I be thinking about. - To me, it sounds beautiful. - Yeah. But in my head, I'm more thinking, somebody out there was like, "I don't like the way it sounds this way." - Yeah, for sure. - Yeah. Even if we have clear intentions with what we're trying to do, the risk, it's really in how we might be perceived, given where our country is and how quick people are to find some sort of way to weaponize anything that can be made into a political statement. Even if we're just doing it for the music, it's very easy for that to be twisted and misconstrued. I had visions of, like, protests. I had visions of people, like, just upset. The mindfulness that attends to an exercise like the creation of an anthem, would necessarily have to be multilingual, multi-genre. It's not meant to be the same song two weeks from now as it is today. And that type of malleable object is one that might have a chance of being inclusive. It's challenging. On one hand, you have to overcome the weight of history that's behind The Star-Spangled Banner. We have 200 years of historical weight behind it. If I were to give advice to artists on how to craft a new national anthem, I would say good luck. That's not a job I would ever want. I think it's an impossible task. And I think that it is going to be exceedingly hard in this country to create one unifying narrative or one unifying song. Yeah. To create a new anthem for America is beyond, like, one person. Okay, close it. All right. Thank you. To be honest, I don't even think of myself as the voice of this song. It can transcend different people. The experience of an immigrant, or the experience of death, the experience of growth, these are all rooted in the human experience at the end of the day. If we want a piece of music that represents a large group of people, then we can't have a singular person writing that. We've got to try to pick up some people off the trip and bring them back to LA and work on this new song. And so, I feel like that we need to have as many perspectives as possible in our writing of this song and to be able to acknowledge those experiences. There is a city with a worldwide reputation for making automobiles. Detroit. Motor City, Motown. We're saluting the record company that really put Detroit on the map. Not all over the country, but all over the world. There it is. Motown Records. Most of the people in Detroit know that this is a place they can come and try to break into the music industry. You take something out of the Black heart out of the Black spirit, out of the Black consciousness, develop it, package it and put it on the market in America and make everybody like it, whether they be Black or white. Seven times you misled me Fourteen reasons to stay Twenty-one times just tried to love you Got me going insane now, yeah Ooh, boy I'm crazy about your smile Got me living on a butterfly cloud It's crazy, it's driving me wild Got me open, no, wide open Superfly, you're so fine Boy, I need all of your love You make me feel so fine So fly You make me feel so fly So fly You make me feel so fly So fly You're amazing So fine Play it, fellows. Yeah. So fine Yes, sir. One of the main reasons we gathered everyone here is really to give Dahi and I a lesson, essentially. Our goal and aim is to write a new piece of music that can be considered a new national anthem or something that's more representative of our country today. As a part of that journey we're traveling through the country to connect with different musicians in different towns and talk about the music from those areas. And so, you know, being here, we wanted to just speak with all of you about the Detroit sound and what you all might be able to impart to us as we go on this journey. To make the anthem completely inclusive? Hats off. We haven't done it yet, so... Yeah. That's challenging. How do you guys choose the things that are dictating your choice of sound? You don't really. It just comes out. It's organic. So you start playing, and suddenly it's like, you might do... Or you might do... Sure. Right. Once I know his pattern, I'm like, "What can I lay in there with that?" Once I hear what he's doing... You don't want to do too much. You wanna know what to put in. We have to listen to what's going on, to make sure that you're not disruptive. And you've got to be supportive. Sometimes, it's your turn to play. - Sometimes it's your turn to shut up. Exactly. And remembering that it's all a conversation. In order for somebody to speak, somebody has to be silent. Or for their point to be made, right? So... So we're doing almost like a horn. 'Cause I wouldn't want to do what he's doing. Right. - But that's gonna influence what we decide to do. And it's emphasizing certain parts of the rhythm and all that stuff? How old were you when you started singing? Oh, my God. My first actual live performance, I was four. I sang for the opening of a grocery store. And I was only supposed to sing one song. And they were clapping so good, I just looked at the band leader and said, "Play Chain of Fools!" It was over. At four? It's all about the feel. If you don't have the feel, you don't have it, period. Exactly. In a lot of ways, you know early on. My dad brought Jimi Hendrix into the house and... It was over after that for me, you know. Once I saw that, I just went... "Whatever that is, I want to be that. I want to be a part of that." I was listening to that Woodstock album. And I listened to it over and over and over again. And I just couldn't believe that he could make the sound of bombs. It was just like "Whoa." All of this coming from one man and his instrument. This man was in the 101st Airborne, so when you write your nasty letters in... - Nasty letters? Why? - When you mention the national anthem and talk about playing it in any unorthodox way, you immediately get a guaranteed percentage of hate mail from people - saying, "How dare anyone--" - Listen, it's not unorthodox. - It isn't unorthodox? - No. I thought it was beautiful. But then, there you go. What was the controversy about the national anthem and the way you played it? I don't know. All I did was play it. I'm American, so I played it. I used to have to sing it at school. They made me sing it at school. It's a flashback, you know. I don't know why the bother. I remember it being a lot of controversy at that time. I do remember things on the news, how certain people thought it was really disrespectful. As a kid, I didn't really know that much about the song at that time. I only knew that in school, you were supposed to do certain things. And I did notice that certain people, like my parents, maybe, even, maybe wouldn't stand up on occasion. I'm a little kid. I was more embarrassed about it than anything. "I don't understand why you're..." "We'll explain it to you at some point." This time for us as Black people was terrible. Detroit exploded on the night of July 23rd. The city was ablaze in the riot area with trembling fingers of flame lighting the black sky. The crack of snipers' rifles continue as morning comes to Detroit. Paratroopers ordered to the nation's fifth-largest city by President Johnson are in armored vans rumbling through riot-torn sections of Detroit. Utter chaos is one way to describe the devastation in Detroit's inner city area. Because we're all Americans, you know. We're all Americans, aren't we? When it was written, then it was played in a very beautiful, what they call beautiful state, you know. It was nice and inspiring. Your heart throbs, and you say, "Great! I'm American!" Nowadays, when we play it, we don't play it to take away this greatness that America was supposed to have. We play it the way the air is in America today. The air is slightly static, isn't it? For those people who may think you're not being very patriotic, all I can say is, unless you are in somebody's shoes, you'll never understand what it feels like. We love our country, and we love the people in our country. But does our country love us? That's the question I ask other people. And not just Black people nowadays. Right. Do you guys have any advice for me and Dahi as we continue on with this journey? To find out about this project at all, I was like, to rewrite the anthem, that's a huge undertaking. But you got my vote. Whatever you do with it. Yeah. An important part of that is going to be rhythm. And then, melodically, give 'em a reason to want to sing. Even if they can't hold a note. Give 'em a reason to sing. Yeah, I like that. That's true. Make 'em feel something. Hit the soul. - Yeah. For sure. Right. A lot of what Paul said stuck with me. When he was talking about... to be able to feel something first and then giving them something to sing along to. Yeah. - I don't know, I think about when you're in a bar when any of those songs comes on, and, like, the whole bar is just, like, singing. It doesn't really matter about, like, pitch or anything like that. It's just this communal feeling. Something in there feels interesting to me. I think, as Black artists in this country, our greatest currency is culture. Motown's success and how popular it was is very similar to what happened with hip-hop, where it came from a certain community, and from there, it kind of grew outside and became popular. It became pop music, you know. I think it's interesting that most of the most notable versions of the anthem that we talk about are artists of color. And I feel like that's because most of those artists were finding a way to express the feeling of their experience in this country through their version of the song. Their arrangements carried a complexity to them, from both the dark and light of their experience in this country. I'm gonna let the groove out. Do it! Well, I feel so bad I feel like a ballgame on a rainy day Here we go! Well, I feel so bad I feel like a ballgame on a rainy day Since my baby left me I shake my head and walk away Let's get on out of here! Oh, yeah! Good, man. Since my baby left me I shake my head and walk away - Congregation, can I get an "amen"? Amen! So, the lyrics you just made up, just now... That's made-up stuff. The groove and everything. What's... Well, that's a Little Milton stuff and plus my own stuff, and it's just a groove. You throw it out there. Yeah, the call and response aspect of what just happened reminds me of, like, preacher-congregation. That's what I was thinking. - Yes! It's the same thing. This music that you hear in the churches is blues music with another name. - Gospel. Yes. The blues expresses a deep humanity. Blues, to me, is for everybody. It's automatic, man. It's like magic. Because... And that's where the music is in this country today. That blues is the foundation of it. You take that out from under it, you ain't got nothing. You know, that kind of, like, leads us into a lot of what we're trying to figure out here with, you know, Dahi and I on this journey of thinking of a song that can be more representative of the American sound, especially since I didn't know until shortly before starting this project that the actual music from the anthem is British music, from a gentlemen's club in England, like in the 1700s. I did not know that. - Yeah. So I get this really American feeling and... it's totally phony. Yeah. I love the national anthem. You know, it's just what it represents to me, which is... I love my country. But, you know, in Mississippi, there was a controversy over our flag. Well, I loved our flag. Because it was our Mississippi flag, you know? Well, then I got to talking to my my buddy, who's Black, and he said, "You know, that symbol there, "I don't like it." Because people have used it in a really negative way. Eden, it's tough. There was something on these flags, both of them. The Confederate flag and American flag, too. The older Black people, they didn't like neither one. If you was in the South, you wasn't free at all. Well, I didn't realize our flag was hurting somebody's feelings, because it made me feel like, "My home, Mississippi." I love Mississippi. So when they came up to vote for the new flag, we got rid of that other one, and now we've got a new flag. I grew to very much dislike the old Mississippi flag. That's why, now if I see it, I think, "Oh, God." I mean, I make these assumptions about what kind of person must live in that house to fly that flag. You know, maybe I shouldn't do that, but it's hard not to because symbols mean something. You got all kinds of people, man. Some peoples don't even want to change. Yeah. Now, we brothers. Sister. We all the same. We all the same to a certain extent. Because you play piano. I play harmonica. Well, that makes no difference right there. Music bring people together. It does. Not just playing the blues. It's in any kind of music. Because the music today in America is off the blues tree. That's one of them limbs off the blues tree. That's all it is. The blues, it'll never die. We're just passing it on. Passing the torch. What I really appreciated about the people here was that it just felt like a real community. Like, everybody had, like, something real to say. And everybody respected what everybody had to say. It's also gonna be interesting to think of how to represent these different feelings that I feel like have come up in a lot of these conversations. For this song to start the process of change, is in conflict. It would have a totally different meaning if everybody was kumbaya and holding hands. For me, I like to kind of live a little bit in the danger zone. That's my process and how I make my music. For me, it's just, "How is this gonna cut through the noise?" at the end of the day. I feel like, in general, Americans are capable of the change that Eden experienced, but we need help. We are in the heart of America now. Yeah. I've never driven through this part of the country before. Nope. We wish. We're shooting a documentary. - We're shooting a documentary. About music. We're traveling the country and we're just going to different places and listen to their music and enjoy and learn about it. We're learning about country here. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - I know. Most definitely. I got a lot to learn, brother. Country music is American. It started here. It's ours. It isn't something that we learned from some other nation, it isn't something that we inherited. And so, it's as native as anything American we can find. It comes from the heart of America. It talks about family, it talks about religion, the faith in God that is so important to our country. And, as we all know, country music radiates a love of this nation. Patriotism. Today, the peace of the world for generations, maybe centuries to come, will depend on our love of our country, our willingness to not only wear the flag, but first stand up for the flag, and country music does that. Country music came out of a need to tell stories. And it's about real stories, and it's about honesty. It's about being willing to express the greatest truths and the greatest struggles. To me, that's what country music is about, is just really putting your feelings out there and maybe somebody will connect with it. The old country stuff, it feels like blues. It feels like honesty, it feels like, maybe it's a weird way to say it, but, like, white people's soul. It came from their home, it came from their struggle. How comfortable do you feel like country audiences are comfortable with change? Country music is music, but it also is country culture. It's culture. Sure. And so, I don't know that... culture is just ready to change always. There's a lot of misconceptions about the origins of country music. There's this idea baked in to country music that it was started in Appalachia, which is not entirely true. And there's this idea that there were no Black people in Appalachia, which is also not true. The banjo is an instrument that was forced to the United States on slave ships in the minds of people from West Africa. The banjo was a plantation instrument. And we're still experiencing the ripples of that today. How would you define the sound of the country voice, and, like, just the overall aesthetic or tone, like, how would you define that? I think it's anything you want it to be. And I think that's something that music gives us the creativity, or it gives us the freedom to have that creativity to use it however we want it. But I think I grew up with so much gospel music, so much old-school country music, and I think all of that really helped shape my voice. It's interesting. I'm sitting here, in my head I'm like, "Gospel, say gospel. "I know it's gospel." The first time you opened your mouth, I said, "That's a gospel singer." What is it that made you hear that? If you could articulate it. The wail. The wail in her voice. The wail. There, you know... There was a truth, but there was a belt that feels like... Like God to me. Mmm. Ooh, ooh. Gospel music is gospel music because the foundation is in God. In a lot of traditional country music loving households, there is God. Now, what kind of God, whose God, those are all up for discussion. But I believe that that is the foundation of that. It's the melting pot. Yeah. Meetings of those sounds, like-- Yeah. So, looking at a song like The Star-Spangled Banner... Would you like to sing it for us? Sure. This is gonna be the first time I've ever sang this sitting down. True. Like, I feel like I need to be on my feet. Oh, say can you see By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming I grew up in a family with a lot of military. My grandfather was in the Navy, most of his brothers were also in the Navy. My dad was in the United States Marine Corps. So to me, I can't listen to the national anthem without thinking about countless people over the years who died for that. And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air I know that a lot of people don't see it that way, but coming from a fairly military-based family, I would say that that's what it brings home to me, you know? Oh, say, does that star-spangled Banner yet wave O'er the land of the free And the home of the brave That was beautiful. Amazing. Beautiful. The thing I loved about Charity's version of the anthem was how much you could feel her pride for her family in the way that she sang it. It felt like she was singing to her father, or to her family members that have served in a way that was really beautiful to witness. It became this really special moment. But it definitely made me think about how her family might perceive what it is that we're doing. And it made me even more concerned about this project. We can't replace the anthem because there are just millions of people that love this song. There are millions of people that do feel like this song is representing them and our country, and we can't change that, because then they won't feel like they're heard. In talking about a new version of the song, do you think it's even possible that we can create a song that has multiple identities that everybody would feel comfortable singing and be like... I don't think so. - You think... I think you always offend somebody, no matter what side of the fence you're on. - Not everybody likes... - I'd love it if you could. I think there's a difference between made for and accepted by. I do think there could be a song made for/with everyone in mind. I think we can try and I think we should try because things have to progress. It has to. Country music is about stories. There's such truth in it. There is pain. There is history. What brought me to country music was just the raw honesty of songwriting and raw emotion that country music brings to the table. Maybe we were born here, but our families' origins are all over the place, you know? I think America boils down to the values that you have and the way you treat other people a lot of times. And I think if we could focus on partly that, maybe, in the song, I think it'd be maybe well taken. I would hope so. I'd hope people would at least be willing to listen. In my head, it's funny 'cause I have this idea of the American Dream. It is the story of just, like, prosperity. And as we were traveling we started to understand that it's not really a dream. It's, like, the struggle to get to the dream. And country is American struggle music. It's very similar to hip-hop, where it's rooted in, like, kind of hard stories, know what I'm saying? Trying to prosper here or trying to make something of yourself. Or just having bad days and trying to find ways to cope. I always found it interesting that country music is talking about these really sad, vulnerable things and telling these really intimate stories. Yeah. I would assume that, for the most part, a lot of people that love country music might have a problem with the idea of reconsidering the anthem or taking a deeper look at ourselves as a country. But yet... they're attracted to music that is doing that on a personal level. Yeah. Yep. Music is what really brings people together. And I think a lot of places don't really realize that. Yeah. Like, that doesn't really happen unless you're in a community where music is ingrained in the DNA of the culture. Like, I think about a place like New Orleans... I would imagine it's probably harder not to be affected by the music here. Yeah. It seems like everybody gravitates toward it so early because that's so much a part of the culture. Yeah. All right. So... So, as you can tell by that, it's not a complicated music, but it's conceptual music, that's got some things that ain't in other cultures, you know? If you could speak a bit more to where these rhythms came from before they were here, you know. We had the biggest port! We had the biggest port. Everybody came through here. I mean, you know, they credit Ellis Island with a lot of the European stuff that came through there. But all the other nations came through New Orleans. The French, the Spanish, the Filipinos, the Mexicans. You know, Cuba, Santo Domingo, that's where his family came from. And all those people became a culture. Yeah. For me, the music that's closest to my heart is jazz, because that's what I've been doing since I was eight years old. The folklore behind jazz is that it came from trying to make music that multiple cultures can dance to. And it came from this combination of cultures in New Orleans. You know, we gotta grow as a community, and this music is from the community, that's what I say. All of those cultures became a culture. That's why they call us The Gumbo. There you go. That's right. That's right. You're right. You're exactly right. What do you think of what that sound would need to be today? 'Cause, like, what we're tasked with is writing a piece of music that can be considered a new anthem or feel like it's more representative of the cultures that have come together, that are here now. What we'd probably do is the same thing as when we play Happy Birthday for someone. We don't play, "Happy... We put the second line on. Can you talk about where the second line tradition comes from and the tradition of the parades and all of that? The tradition of music at funerals is widespread. A dirge is performed on the way to the final resting place of the deceased. We strike up, what we consider a lively number, to make the people forget their griefs and their sorrows, and take their minds off of what had just happened. What about you, Glen? Do you have any advice for us as we are off to work on this new anthem? What would you wanna hear in that? Mmm. Truth. - Truth? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. The truth. - Truth. - That's it. I just saw the thing about, "PBS has sparked backlash over a decision "to have Vanessa Williams perform the Black national anthem "during its 4th of July coverage, "with critics blasting the move as un-American." Oh. Wow. So what's the Asian national anthem? What's the Native American national anthem? What's the Latino national anthem? Hell, I didn't know what the white national anthem is because I don't think that way. If you're gonna do the "separate but equal" segregation bullshit, at least do it all. Go all in. Commit. This isn't unity. It's stupid. You know, I think about the amount of things that people get up in arms about when they haven't even looked at it deeply. Like the amount of people that are upset about a movie, and they only saw the trailer. The amount of people that are upset about critical race theory and don't know what it is. I think that any American that is trying to deny the history of our country is only fooling themselves. America... America needs therapy, man. I think we actually need to talk about these things, because, you know, we're just gonna keep doing the same things over and over and over. It's also gonna be an issue to think of, like, the shape of the song and how to, like, represent these people that are wanting to recognize trauma or the difficulty of how this country started. It's kind of like the New Orleans second line thing, like, that joy and celebration is kind of not really, like, earned, unless everything else has been at least looked at or talked about or unearthed or dealt with. They're not celebrating in the second line to forget the pain. It's more so that they're trying to move that pain in a different way, but the pain is always there. I do think there's something we can take from the second line and try to find a way to take that same approach to our piece of music, to our anthem. I really do think this song should be a form of therapy. In 1830, there was a law passed to get rid of all the tribes east of the Mississippi to the west of the Mississippi. We were brought over here on the Trail of Tears. Brought all the way to Oklahoma and that became our tribal grounds. We saw that the purest thing was the sun. When we meet at our ceremonial grounds, we stay awake all night. We dance in a circle. In that circle, you learn things. You're on a journey. You're born... You're married... Children... And as you get older, you come back to that day because as an old person, you're like a little child again. You have to be taken care of. That's when you get ready to pass on to that next world. Once that sun comes up, we quit. -Mvto! -Mvto! Mvto... It means "Thank you." These songs were invented on the Trail of Tears. If we were to lose that, then we lose who we are as a people. We pass this on to our young people, so, in the future, maybe 50, 60, 100 years from now, they'll still be singing what we're singing. Yeah. Because this is our home, the United States of America. Well, we don't call it that, but it's where we're from. When you say you don't call it that, what do you call it? Ours. That's a joke. Questions? I think one of the first questions I have is just, knowing the little bit that I do about the Trail of Tears and how, you know, so many different... tribes were pushed into the same space, if you all could maybe speak to the music from some of those different cultures, and how those things are different and similar. Yes, I like to think of the Trail of Tears as also the trail of American music. From the South. Muskogee people share music, share instruments, they also dance. And all the elements that characterized blues and jazz are in our Stomp Dance. You've got call and response. You have syncopation. Swing. You know, it's all there. And we've been left out of the American story of music. How do you think that happened, that it's been left out that way? Well, to recognize that the whole North America and even into the South America is indigenous country really kind of messes with the American Dream story. There will not be a healthy, whole person in a country, and I think a country is like a person, until all of the stories are told, until it is recognized that America has indigenous roots. Yeah, it's like the foundation of it. In our travels, me and Kris, we've been realizing symbols are important to people, and sometimes people think of symbols as personal without thinking about everybody else. Are there things from your culture that you feel are like symbols of your community? Well, just like the songs we sang a while ago. Yeah. Our families brought those songs over in Trail of Tears and that's what kept them going. I mean, if they wouldn't have had that, they would've never made it. Today, we have prayer songs, you know, and songs for healing, songs for death, songs for birth. This ties us all back into that strength, that power of that circle that we dance in the fire. There's your symbol. Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. The fire in the center and the circle spiraling out, that's the biggest power you could ever find. Yeah. But it's a circle that moves. You know, and it connects... It goes out in concentric circles and connects every... A circle never ends. Yeah. These songs make us united. Yeah. Looking at how to create a piece of music that can be more representative of our country, I was wondering what you all think of that idea. You don't have winners and losers in a circle. If we're gonna get anywhere, we need a song that says, okay, here we are. And this country, this land, is beautiful. We're part of this land. We're not separate from this land. And yet here we are all together. If we heard all... The stories are so individual. You know, they're not this homogenized overculture version that is hurting everybody. Then we would see the humanity. Then we would understand our absolute connection to the earth. And then we would understand, "Yes, why not a song that would bring people together?" Our tribes, all tribes, we don't have a word for goodbye. - Wow. - It's always, "We'll see you again." And the way we say it is... "Again, we're going to see each other," and that's what this song is saying. Of all the places we've gone, this felt like a source. - Yeah. - You know what I'm saying? It felt like... I don't know, it just felt like home. It felt like this is where we needed to... Everything started to make sense. Yeah, definitely. It just felt like church, man. It felt like real, you know... Like I'm talking to my ancestor. I'm talking to my, you know, folks in my past, talking to my kids, and that's where it felt like the Holy Ghost. Know what I'm saying? Which is in what I've grown up in church, that's just a something that nobody still can explain. It's like a feeling. I can imagine, like, being at one of those ceremonies... Mmm-hmm. ...with, like, 100 or hundreds of people, like, in that circle. Has to be such a cathartic... I mean, like you said, church. It's, like, such a cathartic experience. Yeah. Even the whole idea about, like, the circle, I'm starting to really see the importance of positive symbols, man, that everybody can understand and get, man. I think, shows what this song can be. I think it just has to feel intentional, and gotta have, like, a simple message, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, something universal. Yup. It's kind of cool to end this road trip in a place like Bay Area that is deeply rooted in not only Latin American music, but also activism. Big business, big government know full well that a society divided on race is easier to control than a society divided along class lines. And would like to remind them that however powerful and however strong they may be, that if we, the farm workers, did not till the soil and plant the seed and harvest the food, they would not be able to eat. That's all. That would be... That's nice. Yeah, can you imagine, like, having a national anthem with little kids could sing it every morning in class that was like... Get your day started good. So, you all are on the end of this epic-ass trip, huh? Technically. It's been good. It's been interesting conversations and, like... We're excited to talk to you about, I think, your background, specifically. It's so exciting given how much, like, your family comes from, you know, music, but also, just like, how much you've been involved in activism from such a young age, and how that just naturally found a way in your art as well. Yeah, I mean, I think that it's just totally useless to have any type of platform, and to not speak on issues that are affecting your communities. Yeah. And, you know, I just try and express solidarity with all the struggles, the anti-border movement. I'm very proud of my children that they are conscious of the same things that we were conscious of because these things are not new. But these are different times, and I think that younger artists have as big an influence, you know. You know, we all have our distinct cultural backgrounds, but coming together and kind of understanding our ability to reflect so many different faces in the Bay Area, it's really empowering. And that's why, when thinking about it, it's really difficult to think about, like, a national anthem because there's so many different identities within one nation state, right? Like, what we consider the nation. So, it's really like, how can you universalize the experience of being an American? How can you even say that there is one way to understand it, or to represent it through music even, but through anything, you know. Yeah, for sure. I think that making an anthem that's not contingent on defining yourself within a border or keeping people out, right? It's about being together and creating a better world. That's what I find inspiring in a song. That's what I would like to see. You know, connection to humanity, basically. Yeah. - And recognizing the unrecognized. Yeah. Cecilia's perspective is so vital to the unspoken of this country. From folks who got here undocumented, those who have children who are undocumented here to the labor that people don't talk about, the undocumented labor. Especially, like, on the lyrical side, like, I feel like it's only going to bring the important context to the conversation. Yeah. Because, you know, I think, oftentimes if there's a song that speaks to a number of people that are feeling a certain way, that feeling of being seen is what catalyzes some sort of movement. That's why the conversations we had in each of these cities were so illuminating. I feel excited to, like, start getting into the room and, like, filter all these feelings and thoughts into the music, you know. You know, I think the idea of it was just initially kind of, seemed just big. It's just like, you're making a new national anthem, which is, like, kind of crazy, but... The biggest thing that I took from the trip is just make the music feel emotional. At the heart of it, it just has to connect. - Mmm. I think the only thing I have with that... The only thing I hear... How do you make something that sounds like you've been through shit? But it's not so much, like, sad. It's almost like I'm kind of digging through something. There's light in the tunnel, but we're still moving through it? Yes, exactly. Exactly. I kept thinking about the Muscogee tribe and, like, listening to their kind of spiritual hymns. There's something about what they did that felt kind of a bridge to Negro spirituals. It is kind of cool. - It feels a little kumbaya-ish... - Mmm-hmm. ...which I'm fine with that feeling, but I'm thinking, too, if it... That feeling, it's like... Hold it. - That's dope. - Yeah. Yeah. - Yep. - Yeah. It feels like everybody could feel good about singing. - That's what it makes me feel like. - Yeah. Yeah, totally. Emotionally, we were coming up with some really good progressions and chords that I think can inspire, like, some really profound lyrics. And I think the lyrics is going to really be the forefront of the song. At that point, I think the important thing was for us to have as many voices in that room from as diverse a background as possible to create something that felt like it was at least doing its best to acknowledge those experiences. We decided to form this writers' room, comprised of people that we met along this journey. Hey, y'all, it's Ruby. Hey, Ruby. Hey, Ruby. I have to be on audio, but please enjoy this very dated photo of me in yellow. We talked about Ruby Amanfu because, you know, Ruby is one of the greatest songwriters of our time and also has an incredibly unique experience as an American, being an immigrant from Africa, living in a place like Nashville. Hey, yo. So, I'm Charity. You can probably guess what kind of music I sing. I grew up... And then Charity Bowden has a purity about her and this connection to country music that felt important to have in this writers' room as well. Has everybody else met each other already? I haven't met you. I'm Charity. Okay, yeah, I'm Joy Harjo. I am a poet, writer, musician. Joy Harjo is the first Native American U.S. poet laureate. And she felt like an incredibly important voice to have in this room, so we can make sure that the people that were here before this country was founded, make sure that voice was felt in the song as well. Hey, everybody, my name is Cecilia, my artist name is La Doña... And then Cecilia is an incredible Bay Area artist, and her roots in not only Latin American music, but also activism felt incredibly important to have in this room. In building an anthem, we need something - that connects people... Yeah. ...everybody, all the voices. - There's challenges. - Yes. - And everybody has a story. - Yup. But we are here together. Yes. We are making a story field. There's a lot of tension in this, too, and I think we definitely need to find a way to write the tension. I think it might be useful if we can each write our own verses of what we hear for it. And then once we have a lot of that written material, then maybe we could hash out the ending. That sounds good. Yeah, for sure. Okay, here we go. I'm gonna just write down a bunch of different lines and see if it works. "Our people traveled long ago, we made a home on stolen land. "I claim a country that never claimed me. "I am America." Claim a country that might not claim us. We are America. We claim a country that doesn't see us. - A country that... Doesn't. ...does not see us. It's not, "Look at our beautiful struggle. Now we're strong." It's like, "No, we're this way "because of the horrible conditions..." Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. -"...that we're exposed to." For me, something that's special about this project is really decentralizing the archetypical American voice. - So, it's just about the nuanced way... - Yeah. ...that we want to talk about white supremacy. Yeah, right. Yeah. Instead of just being like, "This sucks and this sucks. "We don't know what to do, but it all sucks." Sometimes, the grass is definitely greener on the other side of the fence. Yeah. Or there should be no fence, and we should all have grass. For me, just thinking as a storyteller, the key thing is making sure... it's, like, validating everybody's voices, but making sure that the tone of it is more hopeful than critical of America. I don't know. I hear your comments, but it's hard as somebody who, like, is 98% critique of America and 2% positive, that's hard for me to, like, totally get behind. Like, "it needs to be 75% positive" 'cause I just don't feel that way. I don't think you should bash it, though. Like, it's fine to critique it, but isn't the point of an anthem to be uplifting? Like, that's your point of view, but my point of view is that I've been raised here my entire life and I realize that it's absolutely not perfect, and we have a long way to go. I don't have the answers for us to get there, but I'll never say anything terrible about my country. I'll never say that I hate it here. I'll never disrespect this country. It's hard to do that if I'm constantly disrespected by the "country." It's hard for me to have that same buy-in 'cause I don't have the same respect from the "country." I'd like those two truths to be able to sit next to each other, - as difficult as it may be. Yeah. What's so powerful about this idea is the notion of allowing them to sit in an authentic way in a song, and then having a resolution toward this bridge, coming together despite the pain and despite the discomfort But also, I feel we're talking about the idea of being solution-oriented. What will we do to change it as opposed to what needs to be changed? Action oriented. - Yeah. That would feel empowering if it's like talking about what we're going to do. So, for me, it feels like an anthem would be more so to mobilize and organize people towards a different future, because where we're at is obviously not working. This is how we can make it work for everybody. Right. You know, we're right up against environmental crisis, and how do we deal with this? We have to come together. Ultimately, this is the Earth, and we are of the earth. We are the land. I feel like, thematically, the bridge can do something, I think, musically to help bring all these things together. I think it'll flow really well. I was thinking of some even spoken word. I wrote these little lines of prayer in Muskogee, it's... "With our praise to the breathmaker "by whose grace we arrive here, and whose grace we leave." I mean, you can kind of go out in the spoken word. Love that! - Beautiful. - Beautiful. Let's get some vocals down. Yeah. - Yeah. We are born of the finest earth We are America We are America Pow-pow. If you could play almost like more call and response. Can you add a bit more distortion? We want to try to get, like, a Hendrix-style of electric guitar. This is not... This is all for us? This is all for this? We don't need an anthem that tries to pretend we are not the country that we are, but one that actually speaks to our aspirations and tries to unify us around the idea of, if we desire it and work together, we can become the country that we wish to be. Maybe there's a song that actually speaks to us today in a way that The Star-Spangled Banner maybe doesn't for some. It could replace it, but it will be people who start using the song, I think, that make the difference. It won't be an act of the legislature that changes the song. It'll be people's practice. It'll be what we sing and the stories we want to tell about ourselves that dictate what our songs are. We need to come together and collectivize and perform together. I believe that singing together absolutely changes the energy of any given space, of any given community, and so those efforts are never in vain. But we are so diverse, we are so different, I think we need many anthems. Hi, Kris! Y'all look good. - Yeah. - Welcome back. How are you doing? Good. How are you? - Good to see you. How you guys feeling today, especially having that much time working on the song together, and now, like, how do you guys feel about it? There's a lot of pressure with it, you know, and it's exciting 'cause it's like such an honor to be asked to be part of such a thing. But I had someone tell me, and it was someone who I considered him somewhat like a mentor, and he was like, "Who are you to do that?" Ooh. And I was like, "I think that's the point." - Exactly. - I'm no one to be doing this. I'm no one. I am your average gal. And just because I don't, on paper, look like I should be doing it, that's more of a reason why I should be a part of it. Doing this project, I think it's actually really important for us to be in these rooms where it's kind of uncomfortable or where you don't seem like you're supposed to be there, I think that's something I've really started to think about. - That story needs to be told. Yeah, that's the point. You know, this country will not find itself - until everyone's voice has a place. Yes, that's right. Completely agree. Sometimes we create bubbles within our own communities. And we don't cross the line. So I think that this was an experience to help me cross the line and want to continue to cross that line. To me, the conversation is more important than the song. I'm just excited to see how it lives, how it touches people, then I would just love to dive into, "Where do we go from here?" Are you glad that you chose to do this, to go on this journey? Yeah, I mean, I'm definitely glad that... I chose to be on the journey. I think that there's a "dot, dot, dot" that is, you know, the reaction and any of that, but I'm standing for, like, curiosity and learning and open dialogue, and I think that that's what the song stands for. I feel happy that I did it, dot, dot, dot. We are born of the finest earth Fed by the clearest waters We walked through tears in the darkest of nights We are America A man of ebony With a grandchild on his knee It's not long ago that they were not free They are America Our Native land We all stand together Our changing earth demands That we do better We rise above and look ahead Come take my hand We lead each other through it all We are America Some arrived here long ago Dreams to live and seeds to sow Still, there's a borderland in me I am America They were brave when they were called Some were forced to stand for cause All gave some, but some gave all They are America Our Native land We all stand together Our changing Earth demands That we do better We rise above and look ahead Come take my hand We'll lead each other through it all We are America We rise above and look ahead Come take my hand We'll lead each other through it all We are America We are America Whoo! Congratulations, everybody. Oh, man. Thank you all so much. Thank you again for being here. Thank you for being a part of this. Let's have a round of applause. - Oh, man. Yeah. Thank you, guys. We did it. We did. Thank you, bro. Appreciate it. Thank you. All right. I'm so excited... Hats off. You sing well, man. Yeah, thank you. Appreciate it. Music brings people together. It does. This ties us all back into that strength, that power of that circle. One, two, one, two, three, four. We're just passing it on. Passing the torch.
