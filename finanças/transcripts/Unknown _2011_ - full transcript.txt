Excuse me, where are you taking this patient? I have instructions to move this patient to the American Hospital in Wiesbaden. You can't take him until I get confirmation. - Here. Show me that. I need to make a phone call. Airport security. Mr. Brandt, line one is for you. It's JÃ¼rgen... from the good old days. Hans, you have to do me a favor. Slow down. We're all full. Calm down. May I see some ID? He doesn't have any. He had an accident. That's why the bag was unclaimed. I don't have all day. Help me with my bags, please. The conference guests are taking their seats for dinner. Professor Bressler has entered the hotel lobby. The Professor is making his way to the Eisenhower Suite. Switch to the 5th floor. Prince Shada is on his way to the reception as well. I need security at the service entrance. Sound the alarm. Evacuate the entire hotel. We'll meet the Prince at the service entrance. You two stay here and make sure they don't leave the room.
