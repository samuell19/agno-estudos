Gotta see a doctor. Is it an emergency? I don't know. It's for him. If it isn't an emergency, you'll have to wait. Sit down. Can I have some of that? Of course, Dr. Jeffries. Has Bob seen them? He's with number five. Found him on the beach near East Cliff Road. Just standing there, he was. Dazed. Like he is now. I nearly run him over. Lucky thing I was driving slow because of the fog. Will you come with me, please? Yeah, I nearly hit him. When I asked him what the hell he was doing there, well, he began vomiting all over the street. I thought the best thing was to bring him here. Thank you. You did right. Come in here, please. Take off your sweater and coat. Have you been drinking? What were you doing on East Cliff Beach? East Cliff Beach. No, I wasn't drinking. Shirt too, please. I was lost. And… it was foggy. Do you live here in Folkestone? I was walking on the pier… Did you come here by boat? Yes. I did. I did. Didn't I? I don't know. Where's your luggage? Do you have a passport? Any identification? Why don't you look? There's nothing. What's your name? Sit here, please. I don't remember my name. How did you do that? On the beach, there was a woman. Yes, I remember her… her dress, it was torn. I think there was an accident. And she… she fell. And I tried to help her. Go on. Who was she? It was… It was very dark. I couldn't see it… No, wait. There was a light. It was coming from the pier. I saw this light-- I was running to the light. Then that man came. Did you tell him about the woman? Did I? Yes, I… I must have. No, I don't think I did. Why can't I remember my name? Do you need any help? A drunk. Are you signing him in? No. He wants to go to London. I'll drive him to the station. It's on my way. Right. You ready? - Yes. - Let's go. - Good night. - Good night, Doctor. - See you tomorrow. - Monday. I forgot. Excuse me. - No phone calls, please. - Promise. - Is this yours? - Yeah. The day is breaking. Why didn't I stay at the hospital? I'm taking you to my home. You know what hospitals are like. They'll just put you in a ward and forget about you. You need more than that. - Why? I want to keep you under observation for a while. Do you… What? Do you do this often? Occasionally. It's my specialty. What is? Memory. Memory failure. It's fascinating. It's like electronics. What do you think I got? We'll see. Look… East Cliff Beach. Why do you bring me out here? I didn't. It's on the way. You recognize this place? What place? The place where you saw this woman. Was it here? I'm not sure. Wait here. I'll be right back. I didn't see anything. How long am I going to stay here? Well, that depends. It's considerate of you. Not at all. It's my job. What was in that shot you gave me? Are you feeling sleepy? - Yeah. - Good. Are you sure I'm not going to be in your way? Not at all. There's plenty of room here. What are you gonna do with me? Well, how about a drink to begin with? Or some orange juice? - Okay. - Okay. Make yourself at home. Where are you going? Not running out on me, are you? Well, go on. I was feeling better. So I… You won't get very far. Well, it's up to you. You want me to lend you a few quid? Why don't you just relax for a few minutes and think it over? What am I going to do? Are you… Am I what? - Married? - No. You live here alone? Yes. Don't worry. I'm not Dr. Frankenstein, trying to lure you into my laboratory. Just… just try to relax. I'm… what do you call it? Amnesiac, is that it? Looks that way. Although I dislike putting labels on my patients. What causes it? Well, many different things. A fall perhaps. I think I did come by boat. I seem to remember… the sea… disembarking passengers… Anything else? Anything else. Darkness… a blur. You think you can do anything for me? - I'm certain I can. - It's like I'm asleep, you know? - I know. Now the only thing is to wake you up again. Then you go right ahead. If you think that you arrived by boat, let's see if we can find out where you might have come from. Maybe I came by ghost ship. I don't believe in ghosts. Hello, Port Authority? Can you tell me what ships docked this morning, please? Between midnight and 3:00 or 4:00. I beg your pardon? A ferryboat. Yes. Coming from where? I see. Thank you very much. The Cornwall from Dieppe. Does that mean anything to you? Dieppe? France? You don't think I'm French? Well, even though you have an American accent, you could have been living anywhere. And you could have been traveling to Paris maybe, on a business trip. Not without a passport, though, or money or luggage. By the way, did you notice? You're married. What? You're married. Yes. I'm married. Or divorced. Or separated. Or a widower. There are so many different combinations between a man and a woman. Anyway, that's the way we'll do it, piece by piece. My wife must be worried about me. What? My wife must be wondering what the hell happened to me. What did you say? Only that we'll have to reconstruct you, bit by bit. Your ring, your clothes, perhaps. We'll talk about that later. I want you to sleep now. Come on. This is the guest room. I think you'll be comfortable here. I know the first thing I'm going to do. This is really very nice of you, Doctor… Laurence. Laurence Jeffries. Even though I'm tired and half asleep, I'm beginning to feel like a new man and I thought maybe I'd thank you again. You forgot your raincoat. I'm forgetting everything. Listen, I wonder how you got through customs. - Customs… - Yes. Assuming that you did arrive from France on that ferryboat, you'd have to have had a passport and identification. Yes, I would, wouldn't I? You sure there's nothing in your pockets? Look again. - Nothing. - And the raincoat? No, nothing. Well, then you must have lost your passport after you arrived. Yes, that must be it. Well, we'll see. I want you to sleep now. I don't think I'm gonna be able to sleep. Yes, you will. I put two tranquilizers in your orange juice. Now, what the hell did you do a thing like that for? - You're gonna have to trust me. - Trust you? I do trust you, Doctor. Wait a minute. Come here. As long as you're here, would you mind giving me a sample of your handwriting? - My handwriting? - Yes. Just jot something down. Anything at all. Quite a lot can be learned from a patient's autography. Okay. - What am I going to write? - Anything. "Arrived in Folkestone tonight." Okay. Arrived… - That doesn't look so good. - No, no. It looks fine. Okay, go to sleep. Okay. November 17th. Memory failure. Patient brought in by a fisherman. Notes for paragraph 133. Symptoms of total amnesia, cause unknown. Schizophrenic tendencies. Good morning. Are you just getting back? There was an accident over by the yacht club. Surgery. And then I had to take care of an alcoholic. Had to drive him to the station. What about sleep that knits the sleeve of care? I know what you're thinking, that I just crawled out of bed with some ravishing young nurse. I didn't say a thing. I can hear you think. Oh, I'm thinking about husbands that aren't spending all their days and nights mending broken skulls and lunatic brains. That's my job. With you, it's not a job. It's an obsession. It's too bad the Winston people can't see that scene. It would make a nice commercial. You're not gonna go on about my smoking in the morning again, I hope. Spare me. Just… trying to be nice. Open the shade instead. - London again? - Of course, London. I told you. You're always going to London. I know. You detest my brother. Well, let's not even go into it. I don't detest him. I like and respect Andrew. I only wish he lived in Folkestone, so you and I could see more of each other. Swinging Folkestone, right? What is it? Nothing. It's you. Good morning, Doctor. - Good morning, Lucy. - You're up early. I'm up late. I just got back from work. Why don't you move to the hospital and get it over with? You'll be there permanently as a patient if you keep this up. Good morning, Lucy. Good morning, ma'am. - Don't forget my taxi at 8:15. - No, ma'am. And don't leave it to the last minute this time. My train goes at 9:11. No, ma'am. Did you find my umbrella yet? No, I haven't. And I've looked everywhere. That makes the fourth umbrella I've lost this year. You should read this story. A man in Dover shot his wife because she was seeing too much of his dentist. God. Imagine. The space age, and people are still killing each other for that. What's the space age got to do with it? Can't you picture an astronaut on the moon cutting his copilot's oxygen line because he suspects the guy of sleeping with his wife? You don't think men will ever change then? No. Neither will women. How nice. He was a plumber. Who? It's always those Lower Depths creatures who do that sort of thing. At least they're creatures with the courage of their convictions. Do you think it's courage? In any event, they liberate themselves. It's the intelligent ones who suffer. How do you know? I've never seen the faintest symptom of jealousy in you. Well, maybe I've actually been dying of it all these years. Well, what do you think the civilized man would do? He'd find an intelligent way of resolving the problem. That would satisfy him more than an actual killing, at the same time, making sure that he doesn't get caught. Thank you. - Oh, balls. - What? I've broken a nail. Larry, I have to get dressed. - Do you really? - What? Today's my day off. Tomorrow too. Couldn't you postpone London until next week? It's too late now, Larry. Oh, darling, please don't be difficult. You're hurting me. No. Did you look in there for my umbrella? No, I didn't. Okay, I'll look. Darling… Your umbrella may be in the car. That's where I left it. I'll look. Goodbye, Larry. You want me to drive you to the station? Don't do anything drastic on my account. Anyway, the taxi's here. Any message for my brother? Just… give him my love. And you too. - Me too, what? All my love. Thank you, dear. Here it is. Have a nice trip, ma'am. Thank you, Lucy. To the Hoverport in Dover, please. What? Your maid said you was to go to the station. Then you were misinformed. Aren't you going to sleep at all, Doctor? How's it going between you and Robert? Is it… John? Edgar. Edgar. I'm confusing him with the milkman. He's not a milkman. He's a sailor. Why does that make you sad? Because he's leaving Monday. Well, aren't you going to say goodbye to him? Goodbye? Don't you know that it's bad luck to let a sailor weigh anchor without bidding him bon voyage? Come on, get your things. I'll drive you to the station. But I… Wouldn't you rather spend four days with him than four days with me? You mean, four days off? Just long enough to keep you from boring each other. Hovercraft flight to Boulogne, France, closing now at exit B. Just a second. I forgot something. Are you going to marry him? Well, that's for him to decide. You and he, that's forever, I suppose? Well, for me at least, yes. Then I insist on being the godfather of Albert Junior. Edgar. You're very funny, you know. It's nice to make people laugh. Doctor? How do you feel? I feel great. You've shaved. Yeah, I had a bath too. - I hear you found the record player. - Yes. It's turning into a beautiful day. Who could ask for anything more? What time is it? - Quarter after two. Are you hungry? - Yeah. I'm starved. Well, let's have some lunch. You always do your own cooking? Or do you have somebody come in sometimes? Once a week, a woman comes in and cleans the place up and breaks a few things. Usually, I take my meals in a restaurant. One lump or two? Well, take one then. If you want more, just help yourself. I really don't know. Well, one then. Listen. Don't be discouraged. I've got reason to be discouraged. Not really. Because I think I have some good news for you. I went back to the port again. You found something? A suitcase near East Cliff Beach. Is it mine? Nine chances out of ten it is. Why don't we have a look at it? It's a good suitcase. Ten guineas at least. You think that's really mine? Well, there's only one way to find out. Try this on. It's nice material. You have good taste. And it… really seems to fit. I think it is mine. Just yesterday… or today? I was wondering, who am I? I could be anybody. A street cleaner, a tramp. But this proves I'm… It proves that you know how to buy clothes, and that you can afford the best. And, look… Paris. Paris. Vincent's, Saville Row. Well, you may have come from France, but you don't live there. I live in London, right? Probably. Better check the rest of the stuff. Here's a letter. Can I see? What the hell? May I? She's lovely. Do you think this is my wife? Could be. What would I be doing with a picture like this in my suitcase? Well, maybe you're a photographer. Paris again. Paris, the 12th of November. "My love, I cannot wait any--" Just a minute now. That sounds like a love letter. It certainly does. "I cannot wait any longer. I want to be…" I don't think that you should read this, because it's from my wife. No. It's signed "Paul." You see… If I'm married and that's my suitcase… this letter must be from me. - I'm Paul. - No. - How the hell do you know? - Wait a second. Just compare these two handwritings. They're entirely different. Yeah. They're different. What's it doing in my suitcase? Well, maybe the woman gave it to you. Or you stole it. Shall I read it? "My love…" I'm afraid it's very personal. "I cannot wait any longer. I want to be near you, next to you, your… your naked shoulder touching mine. I want your touch, your lips," etcetera, etcetera. "I made a reservation for us in the same hotel, the Bonaparte, Rue Jacob. Our hotel. The same room. Remember? This time we will stay together forever. I'd rather see you dead than go back to him." "Him"? "Waiting for you. Longing for you. Loving you. Paul." - Him. - I know what you're thinking. That "him" could be you. Yeah, and he's Paul. There you are, you see? I'm not a street cleaner, a tramp. I'm a son of a bitching fool, and they're making a fool out of me. Unless this… this stuff isn't mine. It isn't mine. Isn't mine! Just because this jacket fits, it doesn't mean it belongs to me. Just a minute. Wait a second. There is one way to find out. Try these on. We have to be certain. Try these on. Do as I say. November 18th. Observations of November 17th continued. Results still in a negative stage. Various attempts to stimulate the subject's memory have failed. Renewed indications of schizophrenia after graphological tests. They fit. Yes. I think they're mine too. I found this in the pocket. Let me see. This looks like your handwriting. Is it the same? It's the same. I must have left a window open. I think there's a storm coming up. I think I know what happened. That bastard! That… that stinking bastard. Take it easy. Who are you talking about? Him. "Waiting for you. Longing for you. Loving you." Do you want a drink? My wife is dead. Did I tell you about the woman? On the beach? Yes, on the beach. I thought it was an accident. She was bleeding. Yes. It was my wife. She was murdered. He killed her. You mean, Paul? Yes. Paul. Go on. Tell me about it. It's here, and, you see, I wrote it all down. I wrote it right here. Frances left me, you see. Frances? Your… your wife's name is Frances? Her name was Frances, yes. I think it was… November 13th, I followed her to Paris. It's in here, you see? Here. It says November 14th, I waited outside the hotel. "Saw Frances and Paul. They walked in the Luxembourg Gardens. I followed them. Tuesday the 16th. Managed to see Frances alone. She is unhappy and frightened. She told me Paul terrifies her." - Yeah… - "She is coming home with me tomorrow." Tomorrow, that was yesterday. I can well understand why she's afraid. - Why? - Because of this. "I'd rather see you dead than go back to him." Yeah. Was he on the boat too? - I don't know. - Did you see him? Did you talk to him? I don't know. Well, you felt threatened too, didn't you? - Me? - Yeah. You were just as afraid of him as she was. I was? Because of this. They're from the gun that's in the pocket of your raincoat. Why didn't you tell me about that? Answer me, please. - Well, I… You told me your pockets were empty. - Yes. I don't know. - Why? You put yourself in my place. You know, I was… I don't know anybody and nobody knows me, and if I showed you the gun, you would turn me over to the police. Isn't that right? And then you wouldn't have anything to do with me. I understand. You felt threatened and you were armed. Yes. By the way, there's… there's one missing. - What? - Yeah. One of the bullets. There should be six. There's only five. One… two… three… four… five. It's only five. Yeah. Maybe the other one's in the gun. It isn't in here. Look. Then it's been fired. I don't know. Imagine Paul was on that boat. He disembarked when you and your wife did. He followed you. And in the fog, he attacked both of you. - You took a shot at him. - Did I? You missed him, obviously. There was a struggle. That would account for those scratches on your chest. Then-- Well, then he overpowered you, you and your wife. Then what did I do? You blacked out. Let's clear up this mess. Poor Frances… She's out there somewhere. They probably found her by now. We have to notify the police. You don't know the police. You might end up being charged with the murder. That would be a perfect revenge for Paul. In fact, Paul who? You don't even know his last name. He can be traced. You know that hotel in Paris. I can trace him. I'm going to find him. I'm going to find him if it's the last thing I do. Who is it? It's all right. It's one of my patients probably. Here. Take this and go to your room. It's okay. Thanks for coming, Andrew. How was your trip? What's this all about, Larry? You were absolutely incoherent on the phone. Not so loud. I've got a patient in there. Tell me, Andrew, what time did you leave London? 2:23. - Did you see Frances before you left? - Frances? No. Is she in London? She's supposed to be visiting you. Actually, she's in Paris. In Paris? Your sister has run out on me, Andrew. Frances? Nonsense! - Frances has been having an affair. - Rubbish. She's not that kind. I found this in her purse this morning. "My love. I cannot wait any longer. I want to be near you, next to you, your naked shoulder touching mine," etcetera. Well, I'm flabbergasted. Who's Paul? Paul Damien. He's a journalist. Until recently, he was the English correspondent for l'Agence France-Presse. That's where they used to meet, in London, using you as an alibi. Nice, eh? Now he's been transferred back to Paris and she's gone with him. Have you discussed this with Frances? - No. - Why not? I don't know. Just the dignity of the thing. Anyway, I wanted to find out how far she'd go. Straight to a hotel on the Left Bank. That's how far she went. What do you intend to do, Larry? Divorce. I want to get it over with. I can't take anymore. Well, I don't see what it has to do with me, old boy. I want to settle this thing as graciously as possible. That's why I need your help. I want you to arrange a meeting between us. - With… with Paul Damien? - Yes. You really want to meet this creature? Creature. You sound just like Frances. Yes, I do. I've never met him and I'm curious to. Wouldn't you be if you were in my place? Where do you want to meet him? - Here. - Here? That's the least he can do. I want you to go to Paris or telephone him. I don't care which. Just make sure he comes here. He's staying at the Hotel Bonaparte, 43 Rue Jacob. What if he refuses? Well, you wouldn't want your sister involved in anything… troublesome, would you? Okay. Hotel Bonaparte. I'll wait until I hear from him. I won't leave the house. And, Andrew, I want him to come alone. Insist on that. Frances must be kept out of it altogether. I agree, Larry. But it is a bloody awkward kind of mission. I want you to handle it so that it won't be awkward. Goodbye. Hey, what are you doing? - I'm leaving. - Really? - May I ask where you're going? - I'm going to Paris. I found out his name. His name is Paul Damien. - How do you know that? - I know. I'll show you. Right here in this book, it's on the last page. See? I see. And what are you going to do once you get to Paris? Never mind. I don't want you to become involved. - You give me that. - Now, wait a minute. If you're absolutely determined to see this man, we can bring him here. You can bring him here to Folkestone? In this house? Sure. No. He'll never come. Yes, he will. He'll come. You're going to write him a letter, right now. You'll give him 24 hours to get here. If at the end of that time he hasn't shown up, you'll go to the police about him. You can bet he'll be on the next boat. He'd much rather be blackmailed than charged with first-degree murder. What, blackmailed? He'll naturally assume that's what you're up to. Stay here. Dr. Jeffries? I'm Sergeant Gordon. Well, come in, Sergeant. Thank you, sir. A man was brought to the hospital last night, or rather early this morning. A fisherman found him in East Cliff Beach. Oh, yes, the alcoholic. I was told you drove him to the station. Yes, I did. He caught the 5:05 to London. He'd sobered up a bit. There was no reason to keep him at the hospital. Did you actually see him catch the train? No. I let him out of the car in front of the station. Then you're not absolutely sure he took the 5:05, are you, sir? No. Well, I think that will be all for the moment, sir. What's… what's he done, Sergeant? Three days ago, a patient escaped from the psychiatric clinic at Lewis. A woman was found in the dunes, raped and strangled. How awful. He's our number one suspect so far. Well, thank you for your help, sir. That was the police. They found your wife. They think you killed her. It wasn't me. It was Paul Damien. They don't even know he exists. So you see, you can't leave now. No. Wait here. They're looking for me… and he's over there in Paris, laughing his head off at how clever he is. Free as a bird. Not for long. Oh, hell. He won't come back here now. Now that they found her. It's going to be in all the papers. He won't come back now. I know he won't. Yes, he will… after he gets your letter. But what do I write? Word it any way you like. He'll understand. "Must see you in Folkestone immediately, before contacting the police." Be sure to put that down. And use my address. Okay. Why are you doing this for me? - Because you're my patient. - Yes. Okay. The metamorphosis is complete. The personality transplant has not been rejected. On the contrary, he has become me. Incapable of motivations from his own past, he has accepted my past. I'm no longer an actor in the drama, only a spectator. Though the props are mine, they too were accepted with remarkable ease, as anticipated. The valise I prepared for him. The suit I measured for him while he slept and will now have to destroy. The diary I wrote. The nude photograph of Frances I supplied to… stimulate him. Her letter from Paul I found in her purse. Everything. That's great. That's short enough to send as a cable. - Oh, hell. - I'm sorry. Does this stuff stain? Gee, I don't know. But it sure got in my eye. Hell, you ruined my suit. No, no, no. It's not ruined. Yes, it is. Look at that. I'll send it to the cleaner. Meanwhile, let me get this off first thing, okay? Seventeenth. Memory failure. Patient brought in by a fisherman. Notes for paragraph 133. Symptoms of total amnesia, cause unknown. Schizophrenic tenden-- You mustn't touch that. - You were talking about me. - Yeah, it's okay. The case histories of all my patients are recorded here. - There's a lot of them here. - Yeah. - You send that telegram? - Yeah. It's on its way. Come on. I'll teach you how to play Liars' Dice. Okay. He won't come. Maybe he never got the telegram. You shouldn't have anything to drink. Maybe it was the wrong address. He could have left Paris, you know. - Why don't we open that goddamn window? - No. Do you want another tranquilizer? No! Why don't you call the harbor? Find out when the next boat arrives. He's not necessarily coming by boat. He could've flown to London and taken the train from there. Hello, Information? Can you tell me when the next boat from France arrives, please? Hovercraft from Boulogne, sir, just coming in. Thank you. It's in the harbor now. If he's on it, he'll be here in 15 minutes. He won't be on it. Laurence, look at me. Tell me the truth. Did you send that telegram? Don't lie to me, please. What? Why? Why would you even think such a thing? You've been against this from the beginning, haven't you? What the hell are you talking about? It was my idea in the first place. Yeah, just to humor me, that's all. Now come on, admit it. That's ridiculous. Just a doctor's trick. A psychiatrist's trick. I heard what you said on that tape. "Schizophrenic" something. The only thing you're interested in is curing me. I'm telling you, I sent that telegram. And this damn Tv! Why don't you get it fixed? What about that newspaper? What newspaper? You said you were gonna go out and buy a newspaper. Oh, you know… later. Go out and do it now. Why? I want to find out what my name is. My name will be in that paper now. I want to know who I am. - Go out and buy it. Go on. - I don't want you reading newspapers. They'll only upset you. You're in a pitiful enough state as it is. I should never have listened to you. I should have gone to Paris when I first started. All this business would be finished by now. - What would have been finished by now? - Nothing! Staring at that picture isn't gonna do you any good either. It's all I've got left. She was my wife. We lived together, made love together. Sometimes… Sometimes I remember everything. I remember… things now and then. I remember the room. I remember the bed. I remember her arms and her shoulders. Everything. Poor Frances. Paris, please. Littré 41-53. This is 78-91. How long will it take? I'll hold on then. Hello? Hello? I'd like to speak to Mrs. Frances Jeffries, please. S'il vous plait, Madame Jeffries. This is the Hotel Bonaparte? Do you have any guests called Damien? Mr. and Mrs. Paul Damien? I see. They're out at the moment. Yes. No, no… No message for Mrs. Damien. Have you finished your call, sir? When are the cleaners going to bring back my suit? Tomorrow. I would like to have worn it for my meeting with Damien. Will I recognize him? Well, maybe the shock of seeing him again. He'll recognize me. I doubt that. It was very dark when he attacked you in that fog. I wonder what really happened on the beach that night. I'll ask him. He'll deny it. You can't expect him to hand over a full confession. I wish I could remember. What about the newspaper? Hold it. It may be one of my patients. Dr. Jeffries' residence. Speaking. Who is this? Where are you calling from? Yes. I'll be expecting you. Well, right away. What? Yes. I'm alone. It's him. What was that gibberish? French. It'll put him at ease. Why didn't you let me talk to him? You will. He's coming? Right now. He's in a pub down the road. Ask him about Frances immediately. That's the point of all this, isn't it? And take that off. - Yes? - He's going to lie to you. - Don't let that throw you. - I won't. Where will you be? I'll be around. Paul Damien. Come in. I know I look shabby. My suit's at the cleaners. You're about what I expected. What do you do for a living? Tango dancer? I'm a journalist. Your brother-in-law said you wanted to talk to me. My what? Brother-in-law? Yes. Andrew. Frances' brother. You sent him to me. Remember? Of course I remember. And I want to talk to you. Don't you want to talk to me? Look, he tells me you intend to discuss this matter calmly, with a minimum of unpleasantness. Good. I'm all for that. Do you really think that's possible? Frankly, I don't know. We have a score to settle, Damien, you and me. I warned him it might turn into a brawl. What the hell did you expect after what you did? What have I done? You committed a crime. I made Frances happy. Something you were never able to do. Is that the crime you're accusing me of? You sound as if you did her a favor. You're a monster! What are you talking about? Well, I'm not talking about sleeping with her. And I'm not talking about "making her happy"! I'm talking about murder! - Murder? - Yes, murder. And I know why you did it. She was coming back to me, so you killed her. Killed Frances? "Killed Frances." Yes! And now you stand there and want to discuss the matter calmly. What you're trying to do is weasel your way out. But I'm not going to let you. But nobody's killed Frances. What kind of insanity is this? She's not dead. She's not dead? Of course not. For God's sake, she's right here. - Where? - Do you actually think I killed Frances? Where is she? She's in the car. Look. Now what is all this? Bring her in. No, let's keep her out of it. This is between the two of us. You bring her in. And don't you try to run away or I'll shoot you. Now go ahead. He wants to see you. Well, I don't want to see him. He has a gun. - You must be joking. - No, I'm not. Who is he? He isn't Larry. - Damien, you keep your hands off her. - He isn't Larry. Take your hands off her. Now close that door. Who is he? - Damien, close the door. - What's he doing here? Frances, come over here. Do as he says. Now, tell him. Come on. Tell him. Tell him what? That it's all over. You know, you two. Just tell him it's finished. It's finished, Paul. Tell him you love your husband. I love my husband. Now, tell him to get the hell out of here. Go on. Get out, Paul. Yeah. You heard what she said, huh? Now, you go away and leave us alone. Yes, I'm going. But… But, hell. Out. Can I talk to her? No! Just for a moment. No, you can't. Please. All right. Okay… Humor him. I'll get help. I heard that! I heard what you said! All right. I'm leaving. The hell you are. You told her you were going to meet her someplace, didn't you? Where? The Hotel Bonaparte in Paris the next time my back's turned, right? Go. You're not running away from me, are you, Frances? Don't. Please don't. Don't you understand, I've forgiven you. But you did go back to him. After going all the way to Paris to bring you home, and after all your promises, back you went. But it doesn't matter. Everything is going to be all right now. Don't you realize? You just killed a man. What the hell difference does it make? You're alive. You're alive… That woman on the beach… It wasn't you. I thought that… I don't know what the hell I thought. Frances, you see, my brain has been in such a chaos. We can start all over again. We'll take it right from the beginning, and start brand-new. Now that you're here, Frances, I won't need this photograph anymore. We can save it as a souvenir. You know, when Laurence went out to send the cable, - I was looking… - Laurence! Where is Laurence? Frances, if you only knew how much I've needed you. Seems like such a long time. I need you now, Frances. I really need you. I want you, Frances. No! No! Let go! You mustn't run away from me. You keep running away from me. Please don't make me. Let me go! No! No! Let me-- You tried to kill me. And I'm your husband. You're my wife. You're my wife. You're my wife. You're my wife. You're my wife. You're my wife! She's not your wife. You see, you said this is my wife. And that's her. I'm afraid you'll have to leave now. The consultation is over. Okay, okay, but I'm going to take my wife. I told you she's not your wife. Then… where is my wife? Why don't you try East Cliff Beach? Remember? East Cliff Beach. Okay, East Cliff Beach. I don't know what I'm going to do. You're a doctor. You're supposed to help people. Who was that man? He was a patient. An amnesiac. He… he killed a woman. He won't get far. The police are looking for him. How long have you known about Paul? Quite a while. Let's get this straight. You gave him that photograph. I gave him everything. The whole story. Including you. You made him believe I was his wife. I kept out of it completely. All I needed was someone to pull the trigger. How did you make him do that? What are you doing? Sergeant Gordon? This is Dr. Jeffries. I'm afraid I have some very bad news for you. That man you're looking for just shot and killed someone over at my house. Thank you. You think the police will buy that story? It makes perfect sense. A dangerous patient followed me home, broke into the house and started shooting. I can tell him the truth. You lured Paul here to have him killed. - Andrew is my witness. - No, Frances. He'll confirm that I asked Paul here to talk about the divorce. Andrew is my witness. So you succeeded. Or you think you succeeded. You've been working overtime again, haven't you? You certainly keep busy. Sixteen hours a day at the hospital. Three hours homework with your notes and your files. Oh, yes. I almost forgot. Three or four minutes with me occasionally in bed, when you feel up to it. A quick one, anybody, before the next operation. You're so conscientious about everything you do. But you're not quite conscientious enough. You've been neglecting one of your patients, Dr. Jeffries. In fact, her case history isn't even recorded in your files. Your bloody files! Taking you up to date in your gallery of freaks. A murder. How clever. A dilettante masterpiece. But didn't it ever occur to you that it might have been unnecessary? Ask yourself… in all the time you've spent dreaming up this… this nightmare, how often have you thought of me and asked yourself, "Why?" Not once. Admit it. You see, as usual, you've been much too preoccupied with more important things. You know something? It's not only been a second-hand murder, Larry. It's been a second-hand marriage too. It's a full confession. You can play it to the police when they come. It's up to you. I'm guilty. You're guilty of being a fool.
