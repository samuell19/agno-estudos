I go my way You go yours You're incorrigible! Stay out of my affairs! - Yi Zhen! - Master! - Kid! - Master Ding! - Let's enter the temple! - Yes! Let's go! Who's that monk?

Aren't we going in opposite directions? At least tell me if you change your mind Be quiet! He has our weapons! Do something! What's happening? I don't know!

They're stuck on me! I told you to leave it alone! - Do something! - Hold still! Hey, kid Me? Of course! Pick up 2 stones Bigger ones! Follow me! Throw them when I tell you to! Otherwise, don't do anything! The so-called righteous people They are vulnerable to my attack I have wounded this monk The venom will reach his heart in 10 days Then I can possess him You can't defeat the Devil What's that? Egression of the Blood Devil's soul! What does that mean? I have destroyed his mortal body But not his soul Which is now protected by virgin skulls It is buying its time for resurrection! Grab my feet! Even my Sky Mirror cannot destroy it! That's disastrous! Can anyone do anything? I can The Sky Mirror can contain it But in 49 days When the Big Dipper starts to shift My Sky Mirror will lose its power That happens once every 10 years What will happen then? You'll have to take over! Me? Who else? The young inherits the earth E-Mei has 2 founding swords One purple and one green Known as The Dual Swords Li Yiqi took them 18 years ago to practice in seclusion They can destroy the Blood Devil's soul Where's Li right now? On Blade Peak You must leave at once! If the egression is complete The Blood Devil will be unstoppable Nothing can be done! - Is that clear? - How about you? I must stay here to contain it! Go! Hurry! Master! Kneel down, Yi Zhen From now on You're the 18th chief of Kunlun I'm passing you the chief's beads You must remember You're now responsible for the school And for bringing glory to it Master, please look on the bright side! Leave me alone! I'm not fit to be the chief Where's the stone? Master! I won't let you kill yourself I will cure you! I won't let you! I must! I won't let you Quiet! Who were you talking to? I'm the chief, I won't allow it! I don't mean to... I'll string them up! The world is in such disorder I was hoping you can save us Now it's the other way round Today is 1st day of the 49 I'll try to cure this monk And then look for the Dual Swords What is that? Fish! - It's fun down there! - Really? Come here... That fish is teasing me! You stupid fish It's an eel! It's alive! Yi Zhen What? Have you ever eaten fish? I was a monk for a few days I was told eating a cooked fish is not considered killing Want a bite? - Are you sure? - Yes! Master Ding! He's the Blood Devil's double! Where's the sword? Behind you! Which one is Master Ding? He turned into a witch! Retrieve! The devils seize every opportunity You must be careful! Yes! What's that, Yi Zhen? A fish. I was going to set it free! Be merciful! We'll set out for the Celestial Fort Hopefully he didn't know about the fish! You better leave I can't cure him! You didn't diagnose him How do you know he's incurable? Only the Mistress can cure him Your Mistress? So there's a Mistress? She is not to be disturbed during her seclusion - Unless... - Unless what? Unless you're destined to meet her The Ice Flame is lit once every month The duration of the Flame varies Before it goes out Anyone who gets to see the Mistress She'll do her best to cure him! The Flame is almost out You're not meant to meet her! My master will die! They have their rules We're on their turf We should abide by their rules! I'll try to keep the Flame ablaze Even if it'll sap my energy I'll have no regrets! We have agreed everything is governed by destiny I'm stopping your intervention Isn't she the witch? It's a trap! Soldier boy! Master Ding You shouldn't call her a witch! But it's true! What's true? She looks like that witch! So do you! The Devil disguised as the Mistress You were fooled Be alert! I must open up his veins You're passing him your skill? All thanks to you! Master! Master Ding! Don't talk during transfusion! You'll get us killed! What should I do? Concentrate! Let your thoughts flow! Don't step on him! I'm formidable! Why are you doing this? Don't you want to cure him? - Are you cold? - Yes! They are guarding the door How can we get in? What are you staring at? I don't think they'll let us in Is there another entrance? There should be! Let's go check! What do you want? Nothing! We need to go to the toilet! You're not allowed to roam about Then we'll do it here! How dare you? Why not? Go ahead and try I will! You don't scare me! How could you? Don't tell my master! Xiao Ru The Mistress is exhausted She must rest now! The monk will be fine You should leave There's a hole here They must have went into this passageway. Climb in! What kind of a hole is it? Help! Help! Are you alright? Where am I? Can you swim? No! Flying swords! Look all you want! That one's gone too! I'll take you to your masters Tell them about your shameful conduct! Please don't tell him! There's nothing to be ashamed of If he found out I pulled her belt I'm in big trouble! That's no big deal - What? - Well? Don't make her angry! I'll do whatever you want! Just don't make an issue out of this We'll settle this! Slap each other until I'm happy Then I won't be happy! This insult is worse than death! I won't do it! I'll take you to your masters! Go ahead, they're not my masters! No! I'll let you slap me! I won't slap a friend! Just forget I'm your friend Slap me! I won't! Then I'll slap myself! You're a chief! How can you do this? Looks like I should quit! Hold on! Luckily I still have a few tricks! Or you'd think I'm useless! The Flame is out! You should leave! Till we meet again, Madam! I don't think so, the Flame is out! If that's the case, why are you here? I'm not here to see you Are you here to fight me? You're right! You were rude to me I must get even! You were delirious due to exhaustion I held you when you fainted If that is rude Tell me what is polite! I... Tell me! I'll to teach you a lesson! Two moves don't make a lesson! That's because you have a mission! Really? We'll pick this up when you return! I'll be back if you'll wait! Let's make a pledge Yi Zhen! Stay and look after your master! You can come out now I knew you'd follow me You're unarmed! Give me one of your swords! I'm saving this for my pupil! Master! I'm not taking you in yet The sword is on loan to you! Take it with you. Better than nothing! Master Ding Something's wrong! Master Ding I look terrible, right? No, not really! Despite my own resistance I can't fight it! I'll take you back to the Fort! If you want to be my pupil Bow 3 times and you'll get your wish This is your sword now! - Will you obey me? - Yes! Promise me! Kill me if we don't make the Fort in 3 days Is that clear? Kill me! Kill... Kill... Kill... He... You're poisoned too? Fetch your Mistress! Whether or not she'll save him Depends on destiny The Flame will decide! That's the rule! Rule? That's what happened to you too! Shut up! You're a traitor! You have no say! Ice Flame? Yes! Hurry! Mistress! A monk should not be so rude! This is Celestial Fort, not Kunlun!

I dare you to come out! If not, may you rot inside! Stupid woman! Xiao Ru! You shouldn't impose! I promised to return But certainly not like this! Master! Kid! Master!

Ji Wu Shuang! Mistress! You do your best, the rest is destiny! Mistress... Let nature takes it course! What's wrong? The Mistress is exhausted from curing you She'll be endangering herself if she helps your friend Ding Yin, I've done my best for him I'm too weak to help you! If that's the case Please kill me! That's my intention! I understand I offer my life to save the world Your Mistress is injured. Help her! Master! Are you all right? - Master! - Master Ding! Ding-Yin! Master... Look what you have done! Who's in charge now? Fine! I'll do it! From now on he's my charge! Let go... Let go... Let go... - Let me go... - What are you doing? You want to kill him? I told you he's my charge! Let go of me! Let go! Come down. We'll figure something out Come down. Let go of me! Let go! Let go! Do you want to kill him? Get lost, monk! Kill me first Mistress! Get out! I'm freezing over the Fort! How can you get out? I must keep Ding here Don't mind me! Why don't you kill him? Leave the Fort now! Leave! - Why? - Why? Mistress! It's too late! Master...

What's going on? We'll be buried alive! Let's go! There's only one way out. Follow me! Through there! I can't swim! I'll drown! You go ahead! Don't worry. Let's drag him in No, I'll drown! Help! What's the matter? I've never left the Fort before Where can I go now? I don't know what to tell you A man should follow his heart Women are stupid and cry a lot Perhaps you should become a nun The simple life is good for you! Just shut up! I'm just speaking my mind! 15, 16, 17 What are you doing? Remember Chang Mei wanted us to go to Blade Peak to find Li Yiqi and The Dual Swords We have 15 days left It'll be doomsday if the egression is complete We can't even save those in the Fort How can we save the world? I was a West Zu soldier against my will I was waiting for someone to end the war I thought my master can do it But the good guys refuse to join forces And they're slow We don't have the Dual Swords And we're separated from our masters They only care about their own affairs They claim to defeat the devil and uphold justice But it's useless! If we follow them We can't even save ourselves! True! They refused to team up So the Devil prevailed! We can't be like them! What can we do now? Go to Blade Peak Blade Peak? This place is enormous We have only 2 days to find the Swords! Yes! Use your mouth! My mouth? Li Yiqi! Use our mouth! Look over there! There's an entrance! The Blade reigns supreme! What are you doing here? Is he Li Yiqi? Li Yiqi is a woman, stupid! I expect an answer for my question! Where are your manners? You almost went into Devil's Turf! The end of the earth is the border! The border? Why are you chained up here, old man? Old man? I'm the Blade! No one can chain me up I did it myself! You know this is the border Why did you chain yourself here? Old man Go away! Leave me alone! The gods and the devils Have always been at war Since the beginning of time I've been here for a century Trying to figure out the truth I was attacked by the Dark Force I'm becoming weak So I had to chain myself The Dark Force has always existed It remains in Hell because of rectitude It is self-destructive force of the Devil That lingers in Devil's Turf and masterminds all disasters on earth There will be no peace unless it is destroyed Though I'm old and weak I must guard the entrance To stop the Devil from entering And unite with the Dark Force Can anyone stop it? Righteousness is weakening Even Li Yiqi may not be the successor Li Yiqi? Where is she? The Dark Force is rampant at the border But the gods are nearby She's in the cave on your right We found her at last! It's too late! Too late? Is she dead? Nonsense! She'll outlive you! I mean My power has diminished I didn't detect the intruder until now! Master! Evil stems from the heart! Gods and devils live for each other! They're all but one! There is no good or evil The Dark Force is supreme He wants to get through I won't let you into Devil's Turf! I bumped my nose! Stop him! Qixi Sword? That's right! Qixi is a righteous sword! It looks familiar Looks familiar? It's not too late to turn back! You're so naive! I must save the world! I won't let you into Devil's Turf! You should know your limits Still the tough guy! - Soldier boy! - Soldier boy! Don't be afraid, I'm here! You're wasted! I suggest you save your body and mind You should retire! Body and mind? This is a battle of wills! I have a bright future but you're dying You're no match for me! Are you all right? Don't come over, the suction is enormous Leave before it's too late! Don't let go! Hold on! - Soldier boy! - Soldier boy! - Soldier boy! - Help! - Soldier boy! - Soldier boy! Be careful! Yi Zhen! What's the matter? I'm a coward. I'm not fit to be chief! Take this back to Kun-Lun What about you? I must help Soldier boy! We'll go together! No. If we don't make it You must find the Dual Swords! I'll wait for you here! Wait for me? I'll find you if we get out! If we can't, it'll be useless to wait! Don't hesitate, get going! Now it's just you and me! If you stay, you won't save anyone! Go! Get going! Go! Soldier boy! Don't let him get sucked into Devil's Turf! Yi Zhen! Soldier boy Hold on! Hold on tight! It's all right now! How do we get out? The Blade died to save us! Soldier boy! Soldier boy, get up here! I can't swim, I can't save you! Soldier boy! Soldier boy! We're out of Devil's Turf! Are you all right? Wake up, Soldier boy! Soldier boy! Purple Sword? Green Sword? Did you see that, Soldier boy? The Dual Swords! There's someone over there! Li Yiqi? Yes! Great! We found her! What happened to you? Likewise! Madam I know about Chang Mei You've come a long way The waves behind overcome the previous The new generation excels the old You shall inherit The Swords Thank you The Swords were cast out of stones they have absorbed the Universal Force To be used by men who follow their hearts They are invincible when men unite with heaven and earth They promote and restrain each other Therefore they must not collide Or they'll be destroyed The swordsmen may die Or the earth may stand still Yet they're most powerful when they become one Damned if you do and damned if you don't I failed to understand Let me ask Chang Mei Chang Mei! We have located the Dual Swords What's going on? Why am I linked to Li Yiqi? Why can't the Swords collide? For them to be united The swordsmen's minds must be in synch The Big Dipper is shifting My Sky Mirror will lose its power soon! How can 2 minds be in synch? When they think and speak the same! The heart controls the man who controls the Swords For the Swords to become one The minds must be in synch! The Purple Sword is heaven, the Green Sword is earth Heaven are earth will be united Madam Li - Madam Li - Madam Li Master! Don't be sad! - Are you responsible for this? - No! Our souls are united Am I still a man? Of course! Your minds must be in synch! You can achieve that through me! The young will inherit the world Hurry to E-Mei Kill the Blood Devil! Yes, master! Listen, East Zu You won't get away this time We lured you to San Zhang Creek But you didn't show up! The Big Dipper is shifting! Stop fighting! Look! Did you hear what I said? We will kill you, West Zu Where's the commander? We need the commander! Your commanders are up here! How did they get up there? The egression will happen soon! Leave before it's too late! What's she saying? Yeah, what's she saying? Look over there! Don't get sucked in! What kind of sorcery is this? - Follow me! - Okay Follow the commander! They're flying too fast for us! Ding Yin? - He's trying to stop us! - That's right! Our swords are locked! - Be careful! - Soldier boy! You can't beat the Dark Force! Yi Zhen! What happened? He's absorbing the sun rays! Hold still! I won't let you egress! What's going on? You're crushing me! I can't help it! Where are the Dual Swords? Don't push! I didn't! It's an earthquake! Don't push! It's a cliff down there! Hold on! Don't fall in! How can I? Don't push! Hold on to one another! Hold on! Hold on! Let go! Don't pull my leg! Don't let him lock our swords I know! Turn them into shields! You can't beat the Dark Force! Where are you, Soldier boy? Where are you, Soldier boy? I'm over here Are you all right? I'm fine! So am I! I can't see Ding Yin He's somewhere between us To break out of this formation We must join hands But I don't know where you are Put our minds in synch. We'll find the meeting point Really? Time's running out! Unite the Swords! Yes! Unite? He's trying to drain our energy! In order to become one Your minds must be in synch Or you'll destroy the Swords and kill yourselves Stay focus! Unite the Swords now! I can't hold on! Yi Zhen, you did not focus And almost ruined the Swords I know! Let's try again! Yes! He's in the way! Your doomsday is here! I can't function anymore! The egression! What can we do? The venom has reached your heart! There's nothing I can do! There'll always be tomorrow! Good and evil hangs by a thread The Mistress sacrificed herself To save the world Such an honorable act! Unite now You're finished for good! What's that? Something's flying down! There are 3 men! Master Chang Mei The young will inherit the earth The new generation excels the old Let's go! - Fatty! - Fatty?
