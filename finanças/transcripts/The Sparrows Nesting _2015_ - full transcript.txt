Don't you think you ought to be with me on this. - Boys, they're all the same, Mom. - You are right. (cheerful music) Honey, you look a little tired, I'm kinda worried about you. - Mom, I get straight As, I made varsity baseball, and I've got scouts looking at me. Oh, I've got bullpen practice after school, so I might not be home till around six. See ya later short stuff. - Bye honey, be safe. - Always and forever Mom, see ya Dad, see ya later, tadpole. - Oh hey, hey, hey, I got a game tomorrow, you wanna play as a ringer for me? - Don't think so Dad, you're way too old and you're way too slow! - Oh, (chuckles) you gonna let him talk to you like that? - Ah, we teenage boys, we always push the boundaries. - We, honey, newsflash! Your teenage years are way behind you. - Though no one could ever tell. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. This is awesome. This is a cool shirt. - Yeah, too cool for school. Which by the way is what I'm about to be late to. - Yes, yes, yes, I'm gonna drive you to school. - Okay. - Honey, I'm gonna go to the food distribution center today. Are you going into the office? - Yep, and I can't wait till this deal's done so I can work from home. - Thanks, love you too, Mom. Yeah, then you won't have to get all dressed up like you are now, Dad. - Oh, oh, oh, well I can't wait till I drive you to school! (laughs) - [Mom] All right, bye honey, love you. - Bye. - Oops, I almost forgot, oh! (cheerful music) It goes with my outfit don't you think? - Fashionista at 14? Honey, relax, it's just school. - Just school, Mom? Just school. - Yeah, let's go. To just school. (cheerful music) - Did you brush your teeth, nina? - Yes, ma'am. - Good, now go get your books so that we're not late for school, huh? - Okay. - [Hector] Do you have my lunch baby, gotta go! - Here you go, ah, ah, ah! Are you forgetting something? Hmm! (heartfelt music) Your keys. (laughs) Go, go, go, go, go! You're gonna be late! Okay, okay. Bella come on we gotta go. - Mom, you want me to be head cheerleader right? - Well, I want what you want, so if you wanna be head cheerleader, I guess so. - And you want me to be popular, right? - Popular, I mean it's not the most important thing, but. - I'm just saying, to be like the most popular girl, I need to set standards for the rest of my girlfriends. They expect it. - They do? - Mom, I'm in yearbook committee, in choir, and soon I'll be a cheerleader. So like I said... - Well hold on, how are your grades? - Uh, As and Bs, mostly. Maybe a couple of Cs for balance, but it's good enough to make the squad if that's what you mean (giggles). - Okay, that's not exactly why I was asking. Good grades are important. - Not nearly as important as being the head cheerleader or popular, so. - Okay, who gave you these priorities? - No one. - Exactly. (Emily laughs) Not me, not your dad. Drawn to the one Who knows your name To the one who holds One day, you will see. Popularity fades, but an education stays with you. - Really Mom, how cliche. Did you see that on a poster or needlepoint pillow or something? "Young lady, never underestimate the value "of proper education, it's so much more important than..." Oh, I don't know, being popular and having friends. - I can see that we need to have a serious conversation. Pencil me into your schedule this week. - Okay, um, there's Di, I need to go. - Okay, well um, we're talking later. Love you. - Do you know you're like a traffic hazard hiding down there like that? I was saving these for myself, but, here you go. - Wow, these are beautiful. - Well they don't really match whatever it is you're wearing, but, yeah I guess. - Thank you. - No problem kid, just make sure to vote for me for head cheerleader, okay? My name's Sparrow, like the bird, Emily Sparrow. - I'm Bella Sanchez. - Look, I gotta run, but, make sure you get those both on and vote for me okay, bye. Hey guys. - Hey Emily. - [Di] So guess what's happening today. - What? - We have a pop quiz in Ms. Trudy's class. - [Emily] Yay... - [Di] Oh, I know right? - [Emily] No! Ooh child let me make it easy When your heart's on fire and your hope's all gone Woo child you gotta take it easy Someday soon you'll be singing this song You should wake up with a smile On your face, Monday, Tuesday Every day, 'cause honey I'm so happy for you - Ah, excuse me, hi. I'm not sure where to put these things. - Here, you can put it right over here. - Thank you. - Are you Anna? - Yes, Anna Sparrow. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Hi. - I'm Charley, this is Maria. - Hi Anna. - Oh, hi. - It's such a pleasure. - Nice to meet you. - Me and Maria have been running this place on our own, so it's nice to have a volunteer come through. - Well I am so glad to be here. - It's so great to have you here. - Thanks, where do I start? - Uh, Maria, why don't you show her the ropes and I'll take this back. - Of course. - Thanks. - Right, this way. - Okay. - Did you say your last name was Sparrow? - Yeah. - That's such a pretty name. I love it. - Thank you, and you're Maria. - Yes. - One of my favorite names. Is that a family name? - No, no, no. My father only named me that because it reminds him of his favorite Telenovela star (laughs). - Oh no, what did your mom think about that? - Oh she always has to joke around with him about it, but I don't think she really cared, I just think it was another way for her to complain. (phone ringing) - Oh sorry. (sighs) It's my daughter. I'll call her back. She's in the process of trying to become the most popular girl at school right now. Pretty much driving me crazy. - Ah, you have daughter? - Yeah. - Me too. Her name is Bella. She's at school as well. Do you have any other kids? - [Anna] I do, I do, I have Max, and uh, he's a great kid but right now he's in a little phase that I like to call, the world revolves around me. - Yes, of course. - Oh, you know it? - Hmm-mm, if you ask my mother, that phase never ends, see? - [Anna] Oh don't tell me that. - Come on I'll show you around. - [Anna] Okay great, thanks. - Okay, so you're telling me that none of that is a write-off? It was a business expense. I have a high stress job that requires me to get constant spa days. - Hey Judy. - Good morning Mr. Mike, hold on, wait one second. - [Mike] Yep? - [Judy] You have several messages here. - Great, are they important? - Not really. - Was that your accountant again? - Yes. - Spa days? - They should be a write-off. I only get them because of my stress. - Okay, are we still on for 11:30? - Yes, and Mr. Cho is on his way. - Great. Spa days. (cheerful music) - What is all of this stuff that's in the way? - We lend this space to a local theater company. They have nowhere else to rehearse, so. - They perform in the main room. Anna, can pass me the tongs? - Sure. - [Maria] They donate all the proceeds to this kitchen, they're a very big help. - Ah, I had no idea. - [Charley] It's hard to tell, they don't have money for advertising, so. - The tongs. - Oh, well how long have they been doing this? - Like two years now? - Two years, wow. How long have you been doing this? - [Charley] Uh, five years. - Please the tongs, no, no, no! - [Charley] Maria's actually coming up on her one year anniversary. (gasps) - Hmm-mm, this is true. - Impressive, impressive. - [Maria] It's the least we can do. Anna, please, the tongs. - Tongs. - [Maria] When I first met Charley she offered me the opportunity to help. - Oh. - When I saw their faces, I couldn't resist. - Oh, how did you meet Charley? - [Maria] Her brother works with my husband. The tongs, Anna, please. - [Anna] Oh, I thought got the tongs. - So, Anna? - Yeah? - What do you think so far? We know it's not super glamorous but I think it's pretty fun. - I think it's amazing and I hope that you'll have me back sometime. - I don't know, what do you think Charley? She is pretty slow, eh? - She's a little slow. - Oh come guys, I can do this! - Okay, fine. - Of course. - We would love to have you. - Welcome to the team! - Thank you, thank you. Hey, what are those? Maria? Charley? - What you've created here, with your DreamBuy app is quite impressive. Forward thinking for a generation is our motto. - Watch a show, touch your product, and have it delivered to your doorstep. Integrate with your home utility bills, car payments, repairs. With up-to-the-minute entertainment. Order the tickets of your show and hail a cab. Basically, everything you can think of. All in one app. Impressive. - Thank you. Well brick and mortar is on the way out and the internet's here to stay and we bring the office to you is kind of our motto. - And it's a good one. - Mike, we love what are you doing here. But 49% is not acceptable for us. In order for us to do the kind of expansion you're talking about, we will need a kind of primary partnership. - Anna. - Hey. - Do you wanna do the soup or the salad? - Salad. (laughing) - Do you not cook? - You know mostly I do take out, I don't know, I just never had a passion to cook. What about you? (sighs) - I love to cook, my whole life I've always wanted to cook. My mother would teach me how to make different dishes all the time, and there was this lesson with every single one. - That's nice. - Yes, I think it was her way of teaching me the things I needed to know without me knowing she was doing it. Look. This is her book of recipes. - Oh wow. - Her mother handed it to her and well she handed it to me. Now I added some of my own. I hope my little Bella, well, I hope she wants to cook. And I hope she learns as much from this as I did. - Well, primary partnership is certainly acceptable. If you're my partner you would be the only, so you would be the primary. Primary ownership would be something completely different that I don't think I'm willing to move on at this time. I mean we have put a lot of time, energy and money into the app. - Well you do make a valid point. And of course we mean no disrespect, our consultants don't believe you have the final logistics in place, to handle the final deliverables. - Mike, please understand this. We can make this a reality. - Well, in all due respect, it already is a reality. - Three cities. You are totally unproven on a nationwide scale. - Mike. If you don't accept this, I'm afraid we'll have to move on to other opportunities. Maybe even a competitor. - Well, you gotta do what you gotta do. - It would break my heart to go to one of your competitors. I know you rolled the dice on this. How much equity do you have? - Put a second mortgage on my house. - Mike, we've talked about this for months. This deal will benefit this company and your family. Understand? - Well, I wanna thank you both for coming, and thank you so much for traveling all this way to come and see me. Now if you don't mind I'd like to, I'd like to think about it a little bit, if that's okay. - Sure, take as much time as need. - I'm gonna go watch my son's baseball game. Thank you. - My son plays baseball too. (gentle guitar music) I know there's no end To the ocean within And I know what I need To go a little farther - Mmm, okay, this is so good. How does Maria do it? - I don't know, she's such a blessing, I mean, she's brightened up this kitchen so much. - You know, she should open her own place. - Oh I know, I told her the same thing. - You did? - Yeah. - (scoffs) She should. - Yeah, seriously. - Hey Pete, Mrs. Butler, how are you doing today? - Good Mike, thanks a lot, yeah. - Great Mike, thanks, how are you? - I'm doing great too, thank you very much. So you got the package. Did you understand it, did you see how I believe that my app can really help your business, cut costs, be more efficient, create a very valuable database for yourselves? - Well, we have actually looked over that extensively, and we're pretty excited. How fast can you move? - Wow, well uh, how fast do you need it? - This is gonna be exciting and we know it's gonna be explosive, that's why we don't wanna wait. We wanna go live immediately. - Immediately? Well that's fantastic. I am working on that right now as we speak, and I should have some answers for you very shortly. - Man, I was counting on this to be long term, and then just like that, bam, it's all gone. - [Worker] Wait till I tell my wife we're not getting a car anymore. (indistinct chatter) - What's going on, Mr. Styles? - [Blair] How's your wife, Hector, and your little girl? - Ah, they're okay, thank you. Bella's so smart, she's like an adult all of a sudden. - [Blair] Please tell them I said hello. - Is everything all right? What's this? - It's your paycheck. - But it's two days until payday. - Mr. Styles do you want to tell him? - What's to tell? They canceled our contract. No warning, nothing. (soft guitar music) - But the building's not done. What about the unfinished stores? - [Blair] No one wants them. - DreamBuy has some kind of, developing a project with a shopping app. Which apparently will destroy any chance of us building more storefronts. - Everyone is shopping online now, it seems like nobody goes to the stores anymore. - If there's no shoppers, there's no stores. If there's no stores, there's no pre-leases. If there's no pre-leases, the investors get very nervous. And just cut us off. Look... I have another check for you, all right, and Blair is gonna write you a good recommendation and uh... (sad music) I'm sorry I couldn't do more. - Me too. - [Blair] Maybe something soon though, right Mr. Styles? - [Mr. Styles] Just please, please don't sugarcoat everything. (sad music) - Is there anything I can get for you, sir? - Mike. - Sir Mike. - Just Mike. - Sorry. - No, you can go home. - Why, did I do something wrong? - No, no, no. It has nothing to do with the spa or nothing, don't worry about it. - I don't have to write off the spa day. - Okay, okay. - Okay. Thank you. (sighs) Do you think the company could reimburse? - No! (foreboding music) - This can not be good. Mi amore, what are you doing home so early, hmm? (scoffs) (foreboding music) Why don't we go inside, I will make you some coffee and we'll talk, okay? Huh? - Okay. (sad music) Construction on the shopping center has been put on hold. - I don't understand, I thought the permits were in place. That everything was going so well. - They don't have the number of pre-leases the investor requires to go any further. (sad music) - Are you drinking again? - No, it's just one drink, baby it's okay. No one is leasing retail space anymore. It could be a long time before I find another job. I'm worried about us, baby. - It will be okay, Hector. We always find a way. God will show us the way, hmm? Ah, A, E, I, O, U - And sometimes Y, as in why are you not on Broadway? Little one, amazing, beautiful and mature. That, young children, is how performs a memorable and proper audition, you would do well to listen and learn. You have such a mature sound. How old are you? - Nine. - 29? - No. - 19? - No! - You're not 39, that is too old for my school. - Just nine. - Just nine she says! Are you pulling my leg, a joke? What grade are you in, fourth, fifth? - Fifth. - [Emily] Check out her shoelaces. - Aren't those the ones I gave you? - Wait, why would you give her your shoelaces? - Because hers broke. (tapping) - Might I have it quiet please? This is a proper audition. Emily Sparrow. I'm quite surprised at you young lady in particular. You're next. Up there, singing, singing. (cheerful music) Have you had any formal training young lady? - No, just my mom. - Just your mom? Not just, your mom is brilliant! Have her call me, oh I want to hire her to teach these miscreants, she has a talent. I can get her a job here, teaching them! And can you read music as well, those little squiggly lines? - Not really, but I usually can pick up melodies pretty fast. - Okay. You would do well in either my lower or my upper division choir. I would love for you to sit in on advanced choir. - Thanks so much. - Okay, upper division meets on Tuesday, you may sit over there now. Next to Emily Sparrow. (cheerful music) - [Emily] This is crazy. - Thanks for the shoelaces. - Oh, no problem. - Yeah, you were great up there. - Yeah, way to make it harder for the rest of us. - I voted for you, I was the one. - [Emily] Oh, thanks. - All right, Mary Had a Little Lamb in C please. - Hey, what's wrong? - Hi Anna, I just don't think I'll be able to volunteer here for much longer. I have to find a job, our family really needs the money. - You should open a restaurant. You would be fantastic at that. - (laughs) I could never afford to do that Anna. - I can make some calls, I'd be happy to write you a letter of recommendation. Oh, you should be feeding people! - No, no, no, I couldn't, I couldn't. - You can. - (laughs) It is impossible. You're so crazy. - Maria, you should come over to my house for dinner with me and my family. Bring Bella, she and Emily can hang out, it'll be great. - Dinner at your house? - [Anna] Yes. - Are you cooking? I've tried your salad, nah. - Oh, well, no, I don't have to cook. - Maybe I should cook. - That's a deal. - Perfect. - Done. - You're such a Neanderthal. How can we even come from the same parents? - Just lucky, I guess. - Okay, so I hope you guys don't mind, but, I was so busy cooking down at the food kitchen today, that I did not feel like making dinner, so I ran by and got us some Chinese food, the house special, I got the fried rice, all the good stuff. - Hey, it's all right with me if you're too tired to cook every day. - What does that mean? - Oh, uh, no, listen, you make the best peanut butter and jelly! Oh, did you get those wontons Emily likes? - I got the wontons. - Okay good. - Mom, can we go shopping today after dinner? I want some new shoes. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, can we just maybe have a family night tonight, and just watch some movies? Oh, oh, well that's the first time you two have agreed on anything in months. - You know what, I had a great day today down at the soup kitchen. - Good, that's good. - [Anna] How was your conference call honey? - Uh, that was fine, but the... - Oh Dad, I got a double and a triple. - Oh, sweet! It's gonna be soon and you're gonna be popping 'em over the fence. - [Max] That's my dream. - Oh, oh, oh, do not do that. (sighs) So, who wants to hear about my day? - Sure Mom. - Well, I met this amazing woman. She is an incredible cook. She makes this soup, that it's so good, it could really be served down in Beverly Hills at one of those fancy restaurants, but there we are, in a soup kitchen. Her name's Maria. - Let me guess, it was tortilla soup. - That's rude, Max. - Max, Maria is a great cook. Oh, Emily she has a daughter who goes to your school, you should meet her. Oh, actually, I invited them to come over for dinner and Margaritas on Friday. - You, you're gonna cook for someone? - No, no, no. Maria is going to cook for us out of her family cookbook. It's gonna be great. Yeah, oh, honey, you're in charge of the Margaritas though. - Oh heck I can do that. - So what's the girl's name again? - Bella. I think. - Bella. Oh. Oh, I almost forgot. - What? - Only the biggest news of the whole year! - I doubt it. - You know what? I need a wonton. - Nice shot. Here we go again, drama queen. - All right, all right, what's this earth-shattering news? - Okay, so you guys are looking at the new head cheerleader of the Gators' cheer squad! Well? - Oh, hey, that's fantastic! I know you really wanted that. - Thanks. - Who'd you have to pay? - The whole school votes. But listen to this, I won by one vote, you should've seen Charlene's face. - One vote (claps), who cares. - Be nice to your sister, you only got a double. - Yeah so now I'm like the most popular girl in the whole school, so. - I suppose you are honey. - By like one vote. (laughs) - (sighs) Sorry I'm late. - [Bella] Papa, you're home! (speaking foreign language) - [Anna] Are you hungry, I have tacos. - Tequila? - Hey, you're really funny eh? - It was not a good day. I couldn't find work. I looked everywhere. - Well, you are home and you are safe. Tomorrow's another day. I'm sure you will find work then, hmm? - Si. - Si, papa, you are a great craftsman. People will start hiring you tomorrow. - You are right, mija. - I hope so. - I'll get you some water. - Okay, come here. Oh, you're getting so big! I'm putting your lips to God's ears. Bwaah! (giggling) - Okay. - Okay, enough of my complaining, tell me something good, some good news. - I made choir, upper division. - That's wonderful, mija. See there? Made your old sad papa smile. (laughs) (speaking foreign language) - I made a new friend today at the food bank. - I see. - Her name is Anna. Her daughter goes to Bella's school. She invited us over for dinner sometime. Would you like that, mija? - Yeah. - You make friends so easily. - So do you Papa. - Ah, not really angel. - I'm more like you Papa. But I made new friend today, too. - [Hector] Yeah? - She gave me these cool laces. - What did she want for those, did she try to sell those to you? - No Papa, I broke my laces, and she just gave them to me. She told me to vote for her for head cheerleader. And I did, and you know what Papa? - [Hector] What, mija? - She won by one vote. It was my vote! - That is good to hear, mi amore. - You're just like your mother. Which I am very thankful for. - Bueno, tacos, hmm? - Hmm, si. - I made your favorite. Corn tortillas! - Oh no, hide me Bella, hide Dad! Hide Papa, ah! No tortillas! - Here you go. - Oh hey listen. I've got something pretty serious I've gotta talk to you about. - The vacation in Maui? - No, hardly. But I don't wanna say anything in front of the kids, so, will you meet me out back? - Sure. - Okay. - Sounds serious. - Come on! - [Maria] Are you sure you're done with your homework? - [Both] Yes! - Okay, daddy's gonna beat you, Daddy's, wait! How did you? You gotta give me chance here! - Hey, that's no fair! - And he pulls ahead, and he, and he, victory! I am the winner! - Hector, you glorify beating a little girl in this game too much, stop it! - What? - It's okay Mama, I beat him the last game. (laughs) - She always beats me! - But Papa does play some tricks on me though. - Hmm-mm. - I do not play tricks! - Yes you do! - No more Hector, come on, Bella has school tomorrow. To bed my little racer. (video game beeping) Hector, I said no! (speaking foreign language), let's go! - Mama, por favor, one more game. - Please! - No, (speaking foreign language), to bed! - Sorry, baby. - [Maria] Now bounce. You too, eh! - Me too? You too, come here! - [Maria] Ah, no Hector (giggles)! Put me down, later, stop that. (footsteps approaching) - [Anna] Hey, here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So, you're really making me nervous. Am I gonna need something stronger than this? - Maybe. (foreboding music) - [Anna] Honey you're scaring me, I don't know what's going on. (sighs) - I... need to tell you, Mrs. Sparrow, that you are the most beautiful woman I have ever laid eyes on. And you are the most amazing wife a man could ever wish for, and you, are the most wonderful mother two kids could ever be blessed with. - Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? - That's it. - Ah! (laughs) - I just thought it was important that you hear it. - It is. (sighs) You know what Mr. Sparrow? - What? - 17 years ago my dad was wrong about you. He's still wrong. I love you. - And I love you. More, I'm the winner. (laughs) - You're such a loser! - I'm the winner, I'm the winner! (laughing) - I love you, loser. - I love you, too. - Mi amore? - Hmm? - I want you to know why I was so late today. - Was it that nasty girlfriend of yours again? - No. She still sleeps with me right here. (laughs) Come here. (soft moaning) - You know Bella worries. She thought something horrible happened. Such an imagination on nina. I swear you let her play too many video games. - Ah, she's fine. (calming music) I must've went to 10 different places looking for work today. - You know I can start looking too, mi amore. - No, I don't want you to work. You take care of me, Bella, the house. That's enough. - You shouldn't have bought my car. Our savings are gone. - I know, I know. - Well, we will figure it out together, hmm? - Together. - Just promise me we won't have to move again. Bella loves her school. - We'll be fine. - What's the worst that can happen? Sack lunches? Ay, corn tortillas every night. - God I hope not! - Ah! - What, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. (laughing) - You drive me crazy. - Good, 'cause I'm nuts over you. (upbeat music) - Come here! When the clouds rolled in Your heart got broke Those dreams you dreamed Turned into jokes Guess you could say You're having a bad day Things were moving fast Didn't ground to a halt When it all went south It was all my fault Look closer and you'll see That silver lining for you and me Oh after the storm We'll put our lives back together Or out of the goodness in our hearts Stop blaming it on the weather Wipe away the tears Begin the healing of the pain Yeah after the storm We're gonna dance in the rain Yeah after the storm We're gonna dance in the rain - What's going on, is everything okay? - My husband, he lost his job. - Maria, I'm so sorry. - Apparently the contract his company was under got canceled. They laid off my brother too. - He is a very proud man. He will do anything to provide for his family. I'm worried he'll start drinking again. He's been so strong. - He used to have a drinking problem. He's been sober for a few years now. - Maria, I'm so sorry. I'm here if you need me, if you need anything. - Thank you Anna, that means a lot. (foreboding music) - Hey, you work here at DreamBuy? - Yeah. - Are you hiring? Because I do remodeling and I'm very good with electrical. - Yeah, I just, no I don't have anything right now. - I could do other stuff, too. I'm pretty good with computers. - You know man, I'm so sorry, I just, I just got nothing. - Look, I just really need a job, you know. I really need someone to give me a chance. (car door slamming) - Good afternoon, gentlemen. - [Mike] Officer. - Is there a problem here? - No, no, he was just looking for a job. - Yeah, just looking for a job. - Well, are you two done now? - Yeah. - So, are you good? - I'm good. Are we still on for tomorrow's game? - Come on Mike, I got you, okay? I'm your ringer, I got you. - Yeah, listen I also need a couple more of your buddies if you got any more to come out, I got, I'm down. - All right, I'll talk to my boss, she likes sports. So I have you covered. - Excellent, bring whoever you can bring. - Oh, (speaking foreign language). I wish this was my size. - Yes that would look great on you Maria. - Bella, isn't this cute. Stand, mija, let me see if it fits. - It's beautiful. May I try it on Mama? - Maybe when we get home, nina. - Oh Maria, yes you may try it on. Go right down the hall. - This is so nice of you Anna. Are you sure you don't mind giving these things to Bella? - Not at all, I love seeing the smile on that little girl's face. - Ay, this is precious. - This was Emily's baptism dress. Oh, wow, I didn't know it was in there. You know we always kind of hoped we might have one more. - I'm sorry. - Let's see what else is in here for Bella. - Yes. - (gasps) Oh! - Mom, I'm home. - Oh, in here honey. - Is that Emily? - Yeah. Emily, this is my friend, Maria, that I told you about, remember? - Yeah, hi, I'm Emily. - Hello. You're just as pretty as your mother said. - [Anna] Oh yes. - [Emily] Thank you. - [Anna] Yes, she is. - [Bella] I love it. - Ay, look what a princess, come here! - Oh and this is Maria's daughter Bella. - Um, yeah, we met I gave her my shoelaces. - Oh, yeah? - This is your new friend, mija? - Isn't that my old dress? - Why, yes, it is. You know what, you always looked so beautiful in that, I thought it'd be nice if someone else got to use it, don't you? - (sighs) Yeah, I guess. Whatever. - Why don't you take Bella and show her your room, I'm sure she would love to see it. - All right, come on. - Go have fun, mija. - So cute. - I wish Bella could have had a sister. She doesn't say it but I know she is lonely most of the time. - Oh... - Well, let's see. Ay, this would look good on you. - Well thank you, I wore it last night. - So uh, are we gonna wipe the diamond with the dudes on the other team today? - What? - What do you mean what? - Don't, please don't. - Dude listen, honestly, you trying to act tough is like me convincing everybody I do ballet. - I get an A for trying, right? - [Both] No! - Well an A minus? - No. - All right, look, a B plus, solid B plus. - Stop. - Looks like you're missing a few players, can I play? - I'm sorry sweetheart, we don't play girly-ball here. - We don't, but he does. Hey do you wanna play in his spot? Wait, wait, come back, I rest. Please, I beg you. - Mike. I almost forgot man, I ran those plates. That truck that was in your parking lot? - [Mike] Oh yeah. - Belongs to this guy named Hector Sanchez, first generation legal, wife, kid. Had a couple of DUls a couple of years ago. But nothing recent, so. Lives near the barrios, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Oh, we need, hey fellas we need to get going huh? - Oh yeah yeah yeah. Well I'll just go in and grab some waters and then we'll get out of here. - Food, yeah? All right, one second! - No, no food. (touching music) - You told your mom we're friends? - Sorry, I thought you liked me. I voted for you. - Yeah. I guess it would be cool to have a little kid around. - Would you like some iced tea? - Yes please. - All right. - Hey, oh uh Maria, this is Dwayne, Dwayne this is Maria. - Hi, very nice to meet you Maria. - [Maria] Nice to meet you. - You have a beautiful smile. - [Maria] Thank you. - [Mike] Just grabbing some waters for the game. - [Anna] All right, you're gonna need it. - Yes, thank you. - It's hot out there. - See you later. - Okay bye! - [Maria] Bye, good luck! - Pleasure to meet you. - [Maria] Likewise. (upbeat music) - Hey I thought we were playing ball, you guys are all there is? Come on Miller, where are the others? - Mike, meet my boss, Officer Jane Santana. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - I thought the game was in 30 minutes? This is the team? (soft music) - Uh, no, the rest of 'em are all meeting us at the field. - [Jane] Okay. - So uh, what position, uh, where do you wanna play? - Third, short, whatever. I'm an in-field gal. - I'm sorry, Santana, short, yeah we agreed that I'm a shortstop on this team. She just said short... - Yes she did and no you're not, and it may not seem like it, but I need you to calm down, 'cause Santana's just one of the guys, okay? - All-American shortstop in college. - Look, there you have it. We found our shortstop. - Just wonderful. - (laughs) Hey, this is great. - Don't touch me. - I'm sorry, all right, let's go, let's get to the field, pick up the bag. - Yeah, there's a lot of chit-chat happening... - You know my shoulder was hurting anyway, so, I'll just, I'll DH. - [Anna] Hey Charley. - Hey. - Where's Maria? - Uh, she got a job offer, so she's at the interview today, so it looks like it's just you and me. - I don't understand why you had to be here so early today. - 'Cause we have cheerleading practice and we said we were gonna be here at seven. There's Di, I need to go, bye. - Bye. (slow piano music) - Perfect. - Hey, you're here early. - Anna, hi. I've got to get to my new job. - Ah, great! - [Bella] I'll meet you back here after school, okay? - I won't be done till about four, mija. - School's out at 2:45! - I know. - Okay, how about this, I can pick you up today after school and take you to my house and then your mom can pick you up there later. - Anna, you... - No it'll be fine, she can do her homework. I can get her a snack or something. It'll be fun. - Would you like that Bella? - Yeah that would be cool. - Great, okay, I've gotta get this, I will see you here at 2:45. - I will see you at four. (slow music) Now, I will be here all day if you need me, okay, mi amore? - I know. - What is it? - It's kind of embarrassing. You in the lunch line. You know. - No, I don't know. I am doing all I can for our family, Bella. And I'm going to be cooking some good food for your new friends. You should be proud of your mama, hmm? - Mom, you know I barely have any friends. Well maybe one or two, but still. - We will talk about it later, hmm? (speaking foreign language), now get to class, go! (speaking foreign language) (sad music) (phone ringing) - Hi Anna, is everything okay? - Hi Maria, I'm so sorry, I forgot to ask where your new job is. - I'm cooking. - Where? - Do you promise not to tell? Bella is so embarrassed. - If it's fast food it better be Mexican, I will be there. - No, nothing like that. I think I'm going to really like it. - The suspense is killing me. - The school. Today is my first day. Honestly I'm very excited about it. - You should be. - Anna promise me you won't tell anyone. I couldn't bear to have Hector know. He's such a proud man, and he's struggling to find work. He couldn't bear to see me work if he can't. - I understand, but I'm sure Bella's excited that you're there. - I have a feeling she's going to try to ignore me. - Well, girls will be girls. Mum's the word. You know what though, I'm very proud of you. - Thank you Anna, and thank you for picking up Bella after school, I think that she's going to avoid a lot of embarrassment, huh? - Well I adore her, so take your time, and I'll see you around four. - Gracias, bye. - Bye. (school bell ringing) - Emily, do you know this little girl? - Be nice, Di. - Remember my one vote? - Yeah. - Well this is Bella, my one vote. - I thought I was your one vote? - Well, I was counting on your vote. - That's great, I thought I was your one vote. - [Emily] Oh... - Hmm, that's funny, because you told me I was your one vote. (sad music) (faint chattering) - Are you ready to go? - Don't we have to wait for Emily? - She likes to walk home with her friends. Do you have a lot of homework? - I finished it all at lunch. - Don't you hang out with your friends at lunch? Oh, why don't we do something fun while we wait for your mom to pick you up? What would you like to do? - Sometimes after school me and my mom like to make cookies. - All right, cookies it is. Bella, I can't believe you know how to make such delicious cookies. - It's not really that hard, the trick is cinnamon mixed with a little bit of nutmeg. - Nutmeg, really? - Mmm-hm, my mom says it makes it taste like Christmas. - Mmm, you're right. It does taste like Christmas. - I think so too. - You're a funny little girl. - You're a funny little lady. - (gasps) Really, come on, let's have some more cookies. Cheers, ping! (laughing) - Hey Ms. Sparrow. Smells like Christmas in here. - Are you teaching this little girl how to bake cookies? - Well actually she's teaching me how to bake. - These are really good. - Who, who is this little girl again Emily? - This is Bella remember? My one vote. - No, no I don't remember, sorry. (laughing) Wow Max, I love that sweater. - Hey pipsqueak, is this your doing? - It is. - Dude, those are unhealthy. - Shut up, Di. - Hey Max, wanna go play video games after this? - Don't think I can man, got homework. - What games do you play? - You're kidding right? - I like racing games. - What, no cooking games? - Ignore her, Bella, it's real easy. - At least my mom's not a cafeteria worker. (crying) - Nice going Di. - What? - I'll go after her. - You know what, I think it's time for you all to go, I'm sure you have homework. - [Di] Yeah, no, I get the hint. Bye Emily. - Bye. - What's her problem? - I don't know anymore. (sad music) (video game beeping) (door knocking) - Hola, Emily. - Hey. - I'm here to pick up Bella. - Oh, okay, she's on the couch and my mom's in the kitchen. - Ah, perfect. - Okay. - Hola, Anna. - Oh, hi Maria. Welcome. - Gracias. (sniffs) Mmm, smells like Christmas in here. - Well we have had a wonderful time making cookies, Bella and me. - She loves to cook. - Really, I cannot imagine where she got that. (laughing) - I can't thank you enough for picking Bella up after school. I will make new arrangements once I can. I promise. It's just, it was my first day. - Bella is welcome here, any time. Okay? - Gracias, Anna. - Of course. - Do you like fresh salsa? - Yes. - May I use these? - Of course. - May I? - Of course. My casina, is your casina. (speaking foreign language) (sniffs) - Hmm, you see. It is a good one. - Oh, si. (laughing) - Lemons? - Oh, we have tree in the backyard. - Ah, Bella, mi amore, run out back and pick some fresh lemons from the tree, huh? - Si, Mama. - [Maria] I'm making some fresh salsa for our friends. - [Emily] Now I'm gonna beat you. - Hurry Bella! - [Max] Ah come on! - You know, now that I think about it, you may need this more than me. - Ah, what are you trying to say? - You're not a cook, Anna. - You're right, you know me so well. I'll put this where it belongs. - Okay. Anna. - Yeah, oh! Got it girl. (laughs) (upbeat music) - Hola mi amore, remember my new friend, Anna, I told you about, well I'm at her house, just helping her out with a few things, so I'll see you at home later okay? I love you (smooching). It's so nice to see Bella having fun huh? - Yeah. Maria there's something I need to tell you, something that happened here before you got here. - [Bella] Is this enough? - That looks just fine, mija. Why don't you go back in and have some fun with the kids, eh? I'll call you if I need anymore. Bella, (speaking foreign language). (smooching) (laughing) Anna! - Oh, got it! (upbeat music) - (speaking foreign language), she must've been so embarrassed. Why would another child say something like that? - I don't know what to say Maria. You know teenage girls, they're just so unpredictable. I think Di was feeling left out, so she just lashed out, the only way she knew how. I'm sure she's sitting at home feeling horrible about it right now. - I don't know. I hope you are right. - Well if it's any consolation, Bella looks like she's having a pretty good time out back right now. - That is true. (calm music) - Hey I know. - Hmm? - Let's sing that song you taught me. - [Maria] What song? - Maria! - [Maria] Ay, no Anna! - Yeah come on. - Not again! - [Anna] How does it start? Maria I just met a girl named Maria (door banging) - [Hector] Maria, I know you're here. - Hector, what is he doing here? (door banging) - You wait here. - [Maria] No, no, I'll go Anna, please. - [Hector] Maria, come out! (door banging) - What is going on? - I wanna see Maria. - No. - I wanna see my family, now. - You need to leave. - Maria! - Maria, don't... - Hector, Hector what's wrong, mi amora? - Get Bella, let's go, I wanna go home now. - Okay, but Bella has a new friend Emily. - There's no time, come on, there's no time. Bella, Bella come on, we're going, let's go! - Okay, Hector, mi amora. Let me grab Bella and my purse, okay? I'll be right back. Don't move. - Maria! - It's okay. - Maria it is too dangerous, don't go! - No, I'm his wife, he needs me. - We can go now, come on. - Okay but Hector, Hector stop, please. - What? - Give me the keys. - I'm fine, come on! - You are drunk, Hector. - I told you I'm fine, let's go, get in the truck. - We are with Bella, don't do this, this is not like you, please. - Don't worry, it's fine. - Hector, por favor. Hector, no. Give me the keys. - It's fine, okay, come on. - [Maria] Hector no. Hector get over here and give me the. - [Rick] Hey, Maria, who is this guy? - Hey, hey, hey, what do you think you're doing huh, putting your hands on my wife. - [Rick] You're getting in my face, huh? - Yeah, I'm getting in your face, you're gonna touch my wife, huh? - I'm calling the cops right now! - Yeah you call 'em, 'cause you're gonna need 'em. - Stop it, stop! I can handle this, I'm fine. Stop. - Are you sure? - Yes. Mi amora, remember the other day when we were talking about Bella, about having friends? Hmm? She has some friends now. And she's happy. I know you want her to be happy. So let her stay, with Anna. Okay, we'll be back for her. Okay? - Okay. (calming music) (speaking foreign language) - You stay with Anna okay? Papa and Mama are just gonna go talk, we'll be right back for you. I love you. Hey, remember what I taught you? I love you baby. Okay, Anna? - Yes, yes. Okay. - Thank you. - [Bella] I love you Daddy. - [Hector] Oh come here princess, Daddy loves you so much. Mommy and me will be back in a few minutes, you be good okay? - Okay, go with Anna. Thank you Anna. - Be careful. - I will call you. (upbeat music) Hector, please stop the car and give me the keys, I will drive you anywhere you want to go, mi amore, please. - I give you everything. I give this family everything. And where do I find you, huh? Cleaning for these people? - No, no, Hector, that is not true! - I worked too hard for my wife to be a servant for anybody! - Anna is my friend, and Bella, Bella has a new friend in Emily, she gave her the shoelaces, you know about the shoelaces. - [Hector] We don't need any friends, and we don't need any shoelaces, we're not a charity case. - Hector! - I can provide for my family, I don't need them! - That is not what I'm saying, I know you can provide, mi amore, I trust you. I've always known that, but right now I need you to stop the car, please, Bella is waiting for us, mi amore, we need to go back to her. - You and I are gonna finish talking about this before I go back and get her. - I need you to calm down, mi amore. - I am calm. - Please just stop the car! Mi amore, don't do this to us! - He just wanted to talk to me. - It's gonna be okay, okay? - What are you doing here? - Haven't you done enough already? - I came to apologize. - Well it's not the right time. - I never should've said what I said earlier. Okay, it's not nice to hurt a friend. Would you forgive me. - Yeah. - Good. Hey, you've been crying. It wasn't what I said was it? - Don't flatter yourself, Di. - Her dad came by the house and he was drunk, and then her parents got in a fight and ran out. - I don't know what was wrong with him, he never acts like that. - Yeah, I know. I'm sorry sweetie. I'm sure that your dad loves you a lot. It's just sometimes when people drink they do things that they wouldn't do otherwise. - Oh, that's sweet Di, but as always, you talk about stuff you don't know about. - My dad's the same way. Why do you think I hang out here so much? I'm here for you. (gentle music) - Please talk to me, help me understand, Hector. - Because I failed us, okay? Because I failed you. (crying) I can't provide for the family. I can't find a job. I let you down. I let Bella down. - Do you know why I fell in love with you? It was because of your soul. Because of your heart. Your determination. And that is why I know everything's going to be okay now. I trust you with everything. You and Bella mean the world to me. I love you both more than my life. And I know you are a proud man. But even the proudest man needs help. I love you, Hector. - I need help. - Now I need you to pull the car over and give me the keys, so I can go get Bella, okay? Hector! (brakes squeaking) (cars crashing) (police siren wailing) (video game beeping) - [Max] Go left. - [Troy] I'm going right. - [Max] Have fun with that. - Why would you go right? - Because, you're dead! - Check again. - What? - Oh, I went, and you left. - Should've gone left man. - Hacker. - Yeah, just keep going. - But is there a cheat? Is there a cheat? - Uh, so what's going on? Have you guys heard from Bella's parents yet? - No, not yet, but Officer Miller's out looking for 'em. - Okay. - I'm gonna get Bella. Hey, you look tired young lady, why don't we go to Emily's room and get you ready for bed? - Okay. - Okay, come on. - Yay, sleepover. (unsettling music) - Hey, honey why don't you just sit down and, I mean Miller's on it, it'll be all right, I'm sure it'll be fine. Oh, here's Miller now. Hey Miller, come on in. - Hey, thank you. Hi Anna. - What happened? - It's not easy to tell you this, we got a call about an hour ago, there was a really bad accident downtown. - [Jane] The Sanchezes were pronounced dead on the scene. - Have you contacted any family yet? - [Dwayne] We've been trying to locate next of kin, but we haven't been able to as of yet. - What about Bella, what's gonna happen with her. - We'll have to take her with us until we can find any family. She'll be with Child Protective Services. They'll place her with a foster family for now. - No! - No, would it be okay if Bella just stayed here, at least just for the night. - Yeah, Dwayne, come on, Officer Santana, I mean she's already asleep. - Mike you know if it were up to me. (sighs) - Please? - For tonight only, that's the best we can do. - Thank you, thank you. - I'm sorry. - See you tomorrow. - All right. - [Anna] They wanna take Bella and put her with strangers. Isn't there something we can do? - I'll see what we can do. It's a good thing you were here to watch her. - I can't help thinking, what if they hadn't been here in the first place. - No you can't think like that. Now, from what I saw, Maria's husband was a troubled man. Now you can't do anything about that. You're her friend, you're doing what you can. - How did Dwayne know about Hector? - Well Hector had come by the office and was looking for work and, well when I didn't have any, um, he got a little agitated and Dwayne was there, but I think he'd been drinking a little. It's just hard to believe. - I just spoke to her yesterday. - (laughs) Oops. You weren't supposed to see that. - I love you. - I love you too Mom, what's going on? - There was an accident. - Max? - No, no Max is fine. Bella's parents were killed in a car crash last night. - Well what's gonna happen to Bella, can she stay with us? - We don't know. Thanks for being so sweet to her. (doorbell ringing) - Right on time. - Honey, will you keep Bella in your room? - Yeah, yeah. (sad music) - Come on in. - How you doing Mike? - Morning Mike, of course you know why we're here. - [Dwayne] Hey guys. - Yeah, yeah we were expecting it. - Have you all spoke with the minor? - Bella, her name is Bella. - I know Anna, I'm sorry, it's just protocol, doing what's required. - I know listen Dwayne, it's just not helping at all, has anybody found any of the family? - Well we're still trying to locate Mr. Sanchez' mother or sister, so till then. - My wife is seeing what she can do, but, these things take time. They may have to, at least for now. - She's just a little girl. You can't just take her, please don't take her. - [Mike] Really is this necessary, I mean honestly. - It's nothing personal Mike, it's just the way things are done. - Bella's parents just died, she's here with people who she knows and who care about her. You wanna tear her away and put her with strangers. How can you be so heartless? - Shh, shh. - Do you even have kids? - Anna, that's not fair. Officer Santana is just... - No, it's okay Miller, I'm gonna wait out on the porch. And yes, I do. - What if you don't find her family? - We'll deal with that when the time comes, but right now Anna, my hands are tied. - Well is there anything we can do? - Yeah, Tori put some calls in, but it was late. You know she's hoping to hear back soon so we... (phone ringing) One sec guys, sorry. (phone ringing) All right, it's Tori. - Mama, mama? - I'm sorry guys, I tried. - Why are the policemen here? Is someone in trouble? - All right Tori spoke to a friend from the DA's office, all right she's gonna pull some strings... I'm sorry Mike, I thought she was outside playing, I didn't... - That's okay, Bella, would you mind going back into Emily's room for a little bit? - Okay. - [Mike] Thank you. - Let's go watch some movies. - Thank you so much. - All right, so, according to Tori's friend at Child Protective Services, if I represent her, which I'm willing to do, I can provide due process without her having to leave the Sparrow's domicile. - You know, that's fine, that's fine with me. You gotta know Mike, I didn't wanna take her. - I know, I know. - Thank you. - [Rick] Good luck you two. - Rick. (sad music) - Thanks for breakfast kiddo. (Bella laughs) Hey guys. - Thanks Rick. - (sighs) Hey. - Rick is funny. - Funny, really? - Yeah, are you tired Ms. Sparrow? - Yeah, I'm very tired. - You should get some rest before my mom gets here. - Honey we need to tell you why the police officer was here. But first I want you to promise me something. Promise me that if there's anything that we say that you don't understand, that you'll let us know, okay? - I promise. - And I want you to know how much everyone here loves you. (sighs) - Honey. The reason why the police showed up is there was an accident, and, um... your parents were in the crash. - Can I see them? - No. Honey, they're not coming back. They're in Heaven now. (sad music) - [Emily] How would you like me to fix your hair, sweetie? - My mom used to fix it for me, she knew how to make it look just like hers. - Well let's see if I can make your hair just as pretty as your mom's okay? - [Anna] Hey. - Hey, how are they doing? - Okay, considering. Emily's helping Bella get ready. This is gonna be a long day, honey. - That's for sure. - What is this? it's a place where you can put obituaries and memorials and things, and I, I just thought maybe if I put a page up for Bella and her parents that some of her family might see it somewhere. - That's a great idea, thanks for doing that. Maybe we can add some pictures later. - Mm-hmm, perfect. - I'm really proud of you. It's almost time to go. - Okay. - I'll go get the girls. - Right. (sad music) - You look very pretty, Miss Bella. - As pretty as my mom? - As pretty as your mom, sweetie. - Hey, you look very pretty, and you too sis. Come on, Mom and Dad are waiting. Why oh why Was now the time I'm so scared I'm about to cry So tell me Why is it that you must go I didn't wanna let you go I wasn't ready for the tide I didn't even know God knows That I tried To hold on, take your hand, tell me now How's Heaven Don't make this any harder Lord help me now You're getting even farther Oh help me out (sad music) - Hey guys. - Hey Rick. - I'll take this in and get it set for lunch. All right? - Hi. - Oh hey, thank you both for coming. The service was really beautiful, thank you. - Yes, it was, when I watched you and Maria work side by side at the food pantry I knew the two of you'd become very close friends. And when you told me that Maria and Hector didn't have a church family, well, I knew this was something that I was called to do. - Thank you. - Come on in. - Thank you, after you sweetheart. (sad music) I also know that there's something troubling you. Something more than the sadness of a friend's funeral. Mike came to see me yesterday. He was worried about you. Not many people know this, but Susan and I know the emotions that you're going through right now. - We never told anyone in the congregation. There was a young woman, she was a relative of a family from the church, well she was considering giving up her unborn baby for adoption. Felt like a dream come true. - Well after years of watching so many members of the congregation have children, and experience the blessings of what a family brings, Susan and I knew that we were ready to have the family of our own. - But when I found out I couldn't, well, when things proved difficult for us, we started thinking about adopting. So when this young woman came to Dave, it just, it seemed meant to be. I fell in love with that baby before she was even born. We both did. - Yeah. - So even though I knew I should be patient, when we found out it was going to be a girl I just, I couldn't help myself, I just started imagining having a daughter. We painted the nursery pink, we even picked out a name, Gabrielle. - But when the time came, the young woman decided that she couldn't go through with it, and she wanted to keep the baby. As a pastor I was thrilled with her decision, but, as a husband it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to go through. - And I wasn't sure if I'd ever really get over the emptiness in my heart. - And that's why I called Pastor Dave so that, you know, he maybe could talk to us a little bit about what we talked about and give us some guidance. - [Dave] I went to see Officer Santana yesterday afternoon. - You did? - Yeah, I mean, her family has been coming to our church for years, so I was able to vouch for you and Mike. I can't promise anything, but... What is it? I thought this was something you wanted, I mean Mike told me how much Bella means to you. - No it is, it is, I just, I wanna be sure we do what's right. - Well, how could it be wrong if you love her so much? - I don't know. Maybe we're being selfish? Maybe it's not in Bella's best interest. - Well there it is. The answer's in your heart. - God is always listening. I mean, you know that, right Anna? - Yes, I just wish He'd tell me what to do. Just give me the answer. - He already has. - I love Bella. Is that my answer? - You know it is. What God's planned for you is, is beautiful and simple. (heartfelt music) You gonna be okay? - Yeah. - [Susan] And you can call me if there's anything I can do. - Thank you, I will. - [Susan] Okay, take care. - Thanks for everything. - [Susan] Of course. - See ya. - See ya. - [Mike] I'm gonna go check on Rick. - May I help you? - I am Carmen Espinosa. - Hi. - I am, I was Hector and Maria's neighbor. I brought Bella's things. I think that she may be more comfortable, she can... - We're about to have lunch, why don't you please join us? - Bella is a very special girl. We know she has no one. I'm happy to see that you and your lovely family are going to look after her. - Would you like to see her before you go? - No. - Thank you. - Feeling good about what Pastor Dave and Susan said? - I am. - Kids, there's something your mom and I need to talk to you about. - Your dad and I have been thinking a lot about something we'd like to do. But we want you in on the decision. - We're not gonna move are we? I mean, I just got head cheerleader, please don't say we're gonna move. - Too bad princess, not everything's about you and your cheerleading. - No, no, no, no, we're not gonna move. But we are considering a change. It's something that's going to affect us all. - I give up, what is it? - Well, if it's okay with you all, and if it's okay with Bella. - We're gonna ask Uncle Rick, if he can help let us let Bella live with us a little bit longer than we thought. - Wait you mean? - We want to see about adopting Bella. Is that okay with you sweetie? - Look, someone brought all my stuff. - Oh look at that, you got your stuffed animals and everything. - Mom, can we actually unpack Bella's things in my room? - Sure, yeah. - Okay. - Will you, will you go help 'em? - Oh, what's this? This was in the suitcase. Check it out. (heartfelt music) (speaking foreign language) - Honey there's something written here. What does it say? - To my beautiful Bella, my mother gave me this cookbook, so I would always remember the loving home she made for us. And so I want you to have this cookbook when you start your own family, so you will never forget your mother, I love you Bella, your loving mother Maria. Wow. (sighs) - I promise Maria. I'll never try to take your place. And your sweet Bella will be safe here. Bella will never forget you. (heartfelt music) - [Mike] Hey I just wanna thank you so much for all the help you did with the adoption. - I was glad to be able to help. You know as a matter of fact, you and Anna were a big help to me. - Really? - Yeah, Susan and I are looking into adopting again. - Oh that's great. (chuckles) - [Max] Heads up! (Mike groans) - [Dave] Are you all right? - Sorry. - Yeah. - [Dave] Okay, well I think we need to show you guys how to play this game. Do you guys have any idea what you're doing? (cheerful music) - [Anna] So what's next? - [Bella] Break two eggs into the bowl. - [Anna] Two eggs into the bowl, okay. Lift me up, lift me up On the wings of eagles Get me home, get me home Get me through this night I'm too far from friendly skies Or anything familiar Take me home 'Cause love waits there for me Love waits there for me I hear a voice, calling though the distance But I can't find the meaning Of what it's trying to say I'm sure it's there To help me find direction And I could use a grip To get me through this day And what once seemed to be Some kind of promised land Is just another desert When you're down Lift me up, lift me up On the wings of eagles Get me home, get me home Get me through this night I'm too far from friendly skies Or anything familiar Take me home 'Cause love waits there for me Lift me up, lift me up On the wings of eagles Get me home, get me home Get me through this night I'm too far from friendly skies Or anything familiar Take me home 'Cause love waits there for me Love waits there for me Love waits there for me (tranquil music)
