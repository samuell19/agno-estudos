(SHIP'S HORN) Still feel like you're on a ship? A little. I'll drop this film off, then we can go back to my flat and you can have a rest before dinner. Tonight I'm gonna show you London. Pat, if you're worried about staying in my flat, we can book you into a hotel until we get married. Oh, no, it's not that. - It's Stephen's mother. - Mrs Trefoile? I've been meaning to tell you something since we left New York. Just before we sailed I received a letter from her asking if I was coming to England. And? Well, I wrote her back saying I was. - On a holiday. I didn't mention you. - That's nice. Well, I didn't see any point in upsetting her. All right. You wrote back, and...? - Now, don't shout. - I'm not shouting. I told her I'd go see her. I want to go before we get settled. Alan, I want to start a completely new life with you. I don't want any part of that other life hanging over us. And it will if I don't see Stephen's mother now. - Now?! - Ah-ah. You're shouting. Come on, out of the car. You're going to meet my producer, Oscar. Alan, you're not listening to me. I'm not listening, because you're talking nonsense. - It's not nonsense. - Would you mind taking my briefcase? Alan. Alan, I was engaged to her son. And after the awful way he died, I think it's only fair that I... It's only fair to you to forget all about him. I don't think I can forget all about him. At least not until I see his mother. - Alan, hello! - Hi! Great to see you back. Let me help you with - oh! Hello, you must be Patricia. - Hello. - How do you do? - You haven't lost your eye, old boy. - Come on, love. Alan, I told you... - Darling, please. - I'll just take the stuff up. What are you trying to do? I told you I'm going to visit Mrs Trefoile. Now if you'll give me the keys to the car, I'll visit her for an hour and be back this evening. But it's too far. You'll have to stay overnight. All right, I won't even stay with her. I'll get a room in a pub or something. I'll be back tomorrow noon, then. And if I order you not to? Are you going to give me the keys to the car, or do I take a bus? - You can drive? - As well as you can. (BRAKES SCREECHING) It is not automatic. Use the clutch! (UPBEAT MUSIC ON CAR RADIO) (MUSIC STOPS) PAT: Oh! - I'm Patricia Carroll. - Come in. (TYPING) ANNA: Miss Carroll's here, Mrs Trefoile. Mrs Trefoile? My dear Miss Carroll. What a pleasure to welcome you. - Thank you. - Had you any trouble getting here? Not really. People were very kind. I trust your companion and your servant have been accommodated? - My...? - Anna, see to it. Really, Mrs Trefoile, I'm quite alone. Alone? My dear, how dangerous. And foolish. Tea, Anna. It was very kind of you to come and pay this visit to me. Yes, I am pleased with Stephen's choice. I see that you are obviously the type of young woman he would properly choose. We have so much to discuss, my dear. So much. My poor Stephen. I... I can only rejoice that he died unblemished. A virgin soul. So much more beloved by the Almighty. Yes. I have prayed for him. And I know you have done so too. And I have no doubt that he was at once transported to glory at his passing. Being the unstained soul that he was. We shall go to church together tomorrow and offer up a token prayer. - I'm afraid I... - Milk? Please. We will not pray at the regular service, however. I do not approve of the new rector. - Oh. - Tell me about yourself, my dear. Young, good family. Travelling all the way across the Atlantic without a companion. Did you not find it lonesome? No. - No, I was all right. - Do you attend church regularly? Well, not too regularly. Not as often as I'd like. Not as often as you'd like? What a strange thing to say. If you like going to church, why do you not attend regularly? Well, I mean... often, there isn't time. Not time for prayer? Not time to sing the praises of the Lord? One's duty to the Lord must take precedence, must it not? Patricia, I'm surprised at you. But you must want to rest after your tiring journey. Anna! Come with me, my dear. I will conduct you to your room. Anna? - ANNA: Yes, Mrs Trefoile. - The tea dishes to be washed at once. - Miss Carroll will be staying for dinner. - Yes, Mrs Trefoile. - We shall be eating at the usual time. - Yes, Mrs Trefoile. - I wasn't planning to... - Come along, my dear. I must confess myself disappointed in your church attendance. My late husband. He was a truly religious man. More so than some who wear the cloth. - When did he...? - He died the year Stephen was born. - Harry. - Yes, ma'am? - Put Miss Carroll's car away in the shed. - Yes, ma'am. This was his room. His? Stephen's. And this is your room, my dear. I trust you will be comfortable, my dear. I keep a modest establishment. One must be careful with one's money these days. But, if there's anything you desire... My poor Stephen's love. - Mrs Trefoile... - Rest now. Rest. We will talk at dinner. All right, Alan, I know. Don't shout. I brought it on myself. MRS TREFOILE: Stephen. Stephen. She's here, in this house, my darling. But, of course, you know. You know. (KNOCKING) PAT: Mrs Trefoile? One moment. Come in. - I hope I'm not disturbing you. - Not at all. I was, erm... Something you require? - Yes, I wondered if you might have a mirror. - A mirror? Is it to adorn yourself, to observe yourself? Mirrors are naught but tools of vanity, Patricia. I know. Vanity, sensuality, Patricia. The Bible speaks of our vile bodies. Oh. I knew you would understand. Oh, how lovely. What is that, a costume? Mrs Trefoile, were you an actress? God was good. He led me from that evil. - Evil? - Yes. A pit of evil. A place for the lost and the damned. The devil's entertainment. God's anathema. It is a painful memory to me. But by the grace of our Lord, and the inspired inspiration of my late husband, no more than a memory. I keep it as a harsh reminder of what I was. Of what I escaped. I think I will take that rest now. It was a long drive. I'll see you at supper, Mrs Trefoile. All I asked for was a mirror. Sheesh! (KNOCKING) - What? - ANNA: You're wanted at service, miss. Service? All right, I'll be right down. (PAT GASPING) Pretty. You can leave that now, Joseph. Pretty. You are late, Patricia. You must learn to be more punctual. I shall read from Deuteronomy. Chapter 1, Verse 1. "These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel. "On this side of Jordan in the wilderness in the plain over against the Red Sea. "Between Paran and Tophel and Laban and Hazaroth and Dizahab." Verse 2. "There are eleven days' journey from Horeb. "By the way of Mount Seir, unto Kadesh-barnea." Amen. Praise ye the Lord. Verse 3. "And it came to pass in the 40th year, "in the eleventh month of the first day of the month "that Moses spake unto the children of Israel "according to all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them." Verse 4. "After he had slain Sihon the King of the Amorites which dwelt in Hesbon "and of the king of Bashan." Verse 5. "On this side of Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, "saying: The Lord, our God spake unto us in Horeb..." Verse 20. "Thou shall eat it before the Lord thy God year by year "in a place the Lord shall choose for thou and thou household." - Praise ye the Lord. - Verse 21. "If there be any blemish therein as if it be lame "or blind or have any ill blemish thou shall not sacrifice it unto the Lord thy God." - Verse 22. - (PAT'S STOMACH RUMBLES) "Thou shalt eat it within thy gates "the unclean and the clean shall eat it alike as the roebuck, and as the hart." Verse 23. "Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof. "Thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water." Anna! You may serve the meal. My foot fell asleep. We thank thee, Lord, for this good food by thy grace is set before us. We thank thee for the beneficence of thy everlasting grace and the constancy of thy dominion over heaven and earth and all that lie within. Thank ye, Lord our God. Aren't you hungry, my child? Mrs Trefoile. Do you have any salt? We use no condiments of any kind in this house, Patricia. God's food should be eaten unadorned. We are vegetarian. For instance, this meat loaf is synthetic. Compounded of bread, oatmeal and wheat germ. How nice. - Anna! Come here at once! - Yes, Mrs Trefoile. You have not washed up properly. There is a mark on Miss Carroll's glass. Oh, it's just my lipstick, Mrs Trefoile. It will come off even though they guarantee. Anna. Go upstairs and wash it off immediately. - Mrs Trefoile, I'm sorry, I... - Go and remove that filth at once. Yes, ma'am. Oh, this is ridiculous! Lipstick! All right, all right! But just for this evening. Oh, and then... (PAT SIGHING) Come here, my dear. Ah, that's better. Good. But I detect scent. I can't wipe that off, Mrs Trefoile. You mustn't be angry with me for trying to instruct you in the error of your ways. My darling, Stephen's love. Mrs Trefoile, I must explain to you about Stephen and me. Oh, how I feared for him, prayed for him. He should not have left home. He should not have left home. He knew what temptations beset him away from home. He knew what sin was in its many guises. Yet, despite this, to leave me here alone. He would not have died had he remained with me. Now I must fear for his soul as well. To have chosen you, so deep in error, yet looking so innocent. Mrs Trefoile, just because I wear lipstick, I can hardly be considered "deep in error". Well, I shall labour to reclaim you for Stephen. I must believe that he was not contaminated, that he died pure. But we will start tomorrow. It is late now. Mrs Trefoile, I'm afraid I can't stay. - You see, I... - You were expected for a lengthy visit. I know, but I made arrangements to meet a friend of mine in London. - A girlfriend. - I see. I must keep my appointment. Very well, but not before tomorrow morning. You must come to church with me and pray for Stephen's soul, and for yours. Indulge me, my dear, just until tomorrow. All right. But I must phone my girlfriend and tell her. I'm afraid you cannot do that, Patricia. There is no telephone here. You will not regret staying. I promise you. - Patricia? - Yes? You are a virgin, aren't you? You are, aren't you? Well, yes, but... Thank God! Am I a virgin? (KNOCKING) ANNA: Service at seven, miss. You are not to be late. Service at seven, breakfast at ten probably. Good morning. What are you wearing? The devil's colour. Go upstairs immediately and put on something proper! - Yes, Mrs Trefoile. - It's almost seven o'clock! We must not fall behind the day's routine. And Patricia, as I was telling you, even though that deluded rector has in literal effect closed the church to me, I have, as you know, contrived to maintain proper service to the Lord in my own home. As is said in Matthew, Chapter 20: "Where two or three are gathered together "in my name, there am I in the midst." I read a book of Scripture each night and morning. And when the entire book has been read, I begin anew. This, naturally aside from my private prayer. PAT: Naturally. MRS TREFOILE: Since I've stopped attending regular services at the church, I've read the Bible through nine, no, ten times. Most earnestly have I prayed for the rector to be given understanding. But he remains obstinate, proceeding in darkness. Good morning, Mrs Trefoile. A lewd man. I have had occasion to complain to the local magistrate. He will allow Harry to drink to excess. But then the magistrate is scarcely better. I have forbidden Harry to enter the place. He claims he does not. But of course he lies. I would have discharged him years ago, were he not a relative of my late husband. And I may do it yet, however. I have many things to contend with, Patricia, but I do not flag. Make certain that your head is covered. Well covered. PAT: Yes, ma'am. We shall most earnestly pray for Stephen's soul and yours. (WHISPERS THE LORD'S PRAYER) Come. - We must go. - You really needn't go, Mrs Trefoile. - Evil man. Evil man. - What did he do? - Forswore his marriage vows. - Really? - And they let him stay on? - Yes. That is the depth to which this church is fallen. He remarried, Patricia. Two years after his first wife died he married again in this very church. Is that what you meant? When you said he forswore his marriage vows, you meant he remarried? - You don't approve of... - Approve? How monstrously inconceivable. On the day of Resurrection, to meet two wives! Mrs Trefoile, there isn't a church in the world that doesn't allow second marriages after death. - Well, some even allow... - You condone this evil, then? - Evil? People marrying twice? - It's against God's law. You have fallen into deeper error than I imagined. But innocently so, I must believe, so as not to contaminate Stephen beyond redemption. - And you, a wedded woman? - Wedded? You cannot mean you do not realise you are, my child. You are Stephen's wife. A betrothal, a marriage, it is all the same in the eyes of God. - Wife? - You are Stephen's wife. You should be grateful that you have been permitted to escape any gross parody consummation of that marriage. And can live out your life as a virgin until it shall please God to call you to Stephen's side. Mrs Trefoile. Not only do I not consider myself Stephen's wife, but I feel I must tell you that if Stephen hadn't died, I wouldn't have married him anyway. Would you get my car out, please? Now, miss? Right now. (DOOR SLAMS AND IS LOCKED) Mrs Trefoile. (BREATHING BEHIND DOOR) I know you're there. Unlock this door. Do you hear me? Mrs Trefoile. Open this door at once. I don't know what you think you're doing. She's insane. (WOOD CHOPPING) Joseph! Joseph! Joseph! I've got myself locked in. Locked in. Look, I only want you to... Now, you listen to me, Mrs Trefoile. MRS TREFOILE: You are not going away. I must save you from your baser self for Stephen's sake. I understand you now, Patricia. You never intended to remain true to dear Stephen. So I must keep you. (FOOTSTEPS WALKING AWAY) Mrs... Mrs Trefoile? (CAR ENGINE STARTING) Hey, mister! Will you let me out of this room, please? Mrs Trefoile's locked me in. Now, I don't want to call the police or make any trouble, but if I don't get out of here immediately... Will you, please? Hey, didn't you hear me? You're all going to be in a lot of trouble if you don't... They are insane. All of them! Mrs Trefoile! Mrs Trefoile! Mrs Trefoile, I've been very patient with you, but if you... PAT: Help! Get me out of here! Get me out of here! (DOOR OPENING) This is a most disgraceful situation. I couldn't agree with you more. Now, if you'll just be kind enough to stand back and let me out of this madhouse, I'll... It is necessary that you stay, Patricia. I cannot tell you how grieved I am that it must be this way. If you were not so firmly in the grasp of ignorance it might not be. This gun is dangerous, Patricia. You know, of course, you're committing a crime? Anna. Anna! Come on, miss. Don't you touch me! Anna, what do you think...? (PATRICIA GROANING) Don't do this! Anna! Why are you doing this to me?! Stop! Stop it! Anna! Don't! Please, don't! You're hurting me. (LOCKS DOOR) Mrs Trefoile, I've put her in... Mrs Trefoile? Oh, yes. Take her handbag and her luggage upstairs. Yes, Mrs Trefoile. (MALE LAUGHTER) You should wear pink more often, Anna. It suits you. You can take these things up to her. - Where is she now? - Upstairs. Back room. - Who took her up there? You? - I didn't notice you volunteering to help. You watch it now. Don't want no trouble with the police. You think they're gonna bother about you? Don't you think they don't remember Harry? What, after sixteen years? Over a forged cheque? No. No, it's this. It's the girl. What's gonna happen if the police find out? They mustn't find out. But how are you gonna stop them? She can't keep her up there forever. What's she want to keep her there for, anyway? For the good of her soul. What? That's what she said. - My God, she is barmy. - And if she is? That's her lookout. Naturally. Look! I haven't let her keep her foot on the back of my neck for sixteen bloody years just to throw it all down the drain now. I'm her only living relative. When she goes, all she has is mine. Ours. You can take these things up to her now. You're in this as much as I am. You're my wife. Yes, I'm your wife. Don't forget it when you're up there. I brought your baggage, miss. You people don't seem to realise the position you're in. Miss? I'm being held against my will. That's a criminal offence. Is it? I suggest that you let me... - You'd better let me out of here. - Just like that? - When the police find out... - Miss, I only work here. It's the old lady that locked you up. You knew about it. That makes you an... A what, miss? An accomplice. A what, love? Look, I'll... I'll pay you to let me out of here. In what way, love? Don't! You're not bad-looking, are you? Not bad at all. I just, er, brought in her luggage, ma'am. Anna told me to. - I shall return shortly to speak to you. - I'm leaving now! (GUNSHOT) (DOOR SHUT AND LOCKED) (FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING) (COUGHING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (DOOR UNLOCKED) Strange, not to have been in my husband's room for 24 years. What now? A lecture on primitive religion? Tobacco too. Put it out. Shall I have Anna put it out? I am correct in my instruction from God. I see more clearly every moment how right it is that I do this. So sunk in error. Anna, open her bags. Leave my things alone! You will remain where you are, Patricia. This is needful and overdue destruction. I pray that you will accept it as the first step to your salvation. Scarlet again. Destroy it! Patricia! Leave my...! (PATRICIA GROANING) (GASPING) Hurt? I did not want you to be hurt. But you must be brought into the fold, you understand. You must be saved. It is the duty laid upon me for Stephen. Sacrifices. It is necessary to make sacrifices. Sometimes it is the only way. (APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS) (DOOR UNLOCKED) Is that all? Mrs Trefoile, I haven't had anything to eat in almost 24 hours. Not because nothing has been offered you, child. But because your palate is corrupted. What do you intend to do? Starve me into repentance? If necessary. To fast is excellent for the strengthening of the spirit. I shall read from the Book of Judges. Chapter 1. Verse 1. "Now, after the death of Joshua it came to pass "that the children of Israel asked the Lord, saying: 'Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites... "" Anna? I'll give you a thousand pounds if you let me out of here. It's not an idle offer, Anna. My father is a very wealthy man. You're speaking foolishness, Patricia. Sit still and listen. You'd have the money within a week. I warn you, child, the more you fight against acceptance, the more... 2,000 pounds. 2,000 pounds, Anna! Within a week. How long would you have to work for Mrs Trefoile to earn that much? You don't have to be afraid. Can you see it, Anna? Harry with 2,000 pounds at his disposal. Daresay you'd never see the man again. Would you? Now, sit still and listen. Verse 3. "And Judah said unto Simeon his brother: 'Come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. "" Very well. I'll save my father's money. Forget it, Anna. I don't know why I offered it in the first place. It really isn't necessary. I told you I was supposed to meet a friend of mine in London last night. Well, when I don't show up, he'll know something's wrong. He? That's right. - He! - You told me that it was a... I lied, Mrs Trefoile. Lied. It's not a woman. It's a man. A man. It's the man I'm going to marry. Marry, Mrs Trefoile. And have there been others as well? Did you lie to me about your virginity? I am not by nature a vindictive person, Mrs Trefoile. But believe me, I'm going to take intense pleasure in seeing all of you arrested and put in jail. Did you lie to me about being a virgin? Guess. Remove the tray, Anna. There will be no tea or food until you show respect and answer me. That's too high a price to pay, Mrs Trefoile. I'd rather starve. Starve, then. And what will you do when Alan comes to get me? Beg for mercy? Cry? No one is going to find you here, Patricia. No one. (DOOR SHUT AND LOCKED) (FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING) Stephen! Stephen! There is another man. Oh, my darling. - Where do you think you're going? - You know where I'm going. - The work's done. - Mine isn't. Well, mine is. I'm gonna have a few beers. I suppose you're going to the Three Horseshoes? Since that's the only public house in this bloody town. - Yes, that's where I'm going. - You're gonna see that girl, aren't you? Supposing I tell Mrs Trefoile? You're not gonna tell her, are you, Anna? You love me, don't you? Harry! (PAT SCREAMING) (LAUGHING) HARRY: I'm not stopping you. Go on, go on. ♪ Here we go round the mulberry bush ♪ (PAT MOANING) Go on! I can't run any faster. PAT: Please stop! (PANTING) (MOTORBOAT ENGINE) (HAMMERING) You persist in being obstinate, child. Do you not realise that I mean you only good? Well, you shall learn respect, Patricia. No matter how long it takes. No matter how long it takes. (DOOR SHUT AND LOCKED) (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING) Alan. Please come, Alan. Please come. (GUNSHOT) Harry. Stay close to the house. I have a job for you. (GUNSHOT) (APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS) Come out here, child. There's something I want you to do. - PAT: Give me something to eat then. - We must feed your spirit first. - PAT: Even if my body dies? - A little fasting will hardly be a cause of death. That is neither here nor there. This further wickedness you have confessed. PAT: About my fiancé? Worries you, doesn't it? Not at all. You will write him a note giving some plausible excuse for not meeting him. PAT: You are insane if you think I'd do such a thing. - You will do it, and at once. - (RAPS GLASS WITH GUN) Now, come out! Go ahead! Shoot! Then I'll never be redeemed for Stephen, will I? Then he'll be contaminated for eternity. Well? What are you waiting for? Anna, help Miss Carroll to decide. (ANNA SCREAMS IN PAIN) (PAT MOANING) (PAT CRYING OUT) Don't! Will you write the note? No! Please, miss, you must write it! No! Damn you, no! Shall I slash your face, child? Shall I cut it up? No man will ever have you then. You will be safe for Stephen. Please, no. Please. Then write the note. (CAR DRIVING UP OUTSIDE) (DOOR BEING UNLOCKED) Want the car, do you? Want to go home, do you? All right, love. I'll let you go. You know what the price is, though, don't you? You know what it is, all right. You know the price, all right! That's naughty! You thought you'd fooled me, didn't you? You thought old Harry's drunk. His brain's all fuddled. - He'll never know what hit him. - Don't! (SCREAMING) (WHIMPERING) We don't want to wake the old lady. We don't want to make a lot of noise, do we? She was trying to escape again, ma'am. I was just... Silence! - Get out of here. - Yes, ma'am. Right away. (DOOR BEING LOCKED) (SOBBING) I left the message where you said, ma'am. - Go downstairs and pack your things! - Ma'am, I know you think I... - Don't even speak to me! - Ma'am, I told you... You have twenty minutes, not a moment more. This isn't fair! I don't deserve this kind of treatment. Mrs Trefoile, listen! - Get your hands off this door! - We've got to talk about this! I will have you thrown in jail for this! Oh? Oh, will you? Maybe they'd be interested to hear about your little guest, then. Now, ma'am, I didn't mean that. Slip of the tongue. All I want to do is stay here and serve you. Get out of here. - Get out of here! - Sixteen years, eh? Sixteen years of working me for pennies, and my wife! And now you think you'll get rid of us just like that? Well, I'll tell you this, old woman. You won't... All right. Watch it! Easy, ma'am. Don't! I'm going! I'm going! Be careful, now! Don't do something you'd regret! MRS TREFOILE: Stephen! Stephen! What am I gonna do?! My God! She is barmy! The old hag. The bloody old hag! Sixteen years, eh? Sixteen years! And I'm chucked out. (DOOR BEING UNLOCKED) (DOOR CREAKING) (GUNSHOTS) He who sheddeth man's blood, so shall his blood be shed. (MRS TREFOILE MOANING) Stephen! Why did you ever leave me? (SOBBING) Oh, Stephen, don't look at me! Don't... look at... me. MRS TREFOILE: Anna. Anna, I neglected to mention that Harry will not be back for three to four days. - Three to four days? - Yes. I decided that as he had to go to London I would have him stay on and pick up some things I need. You'd best do your weekly marketing now, Anna. I'll take the oatmeal up to Miss Carroll. Yes, Mrs Trefoile. (APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS) (DOOR BEING UNLOCKED) Yes. You may eat now. I've decided to forgive you. You may eat. Are you so frightened of me, child? Do you not realise that my concern for you is genuine? That I wish you only God's acceptance. And my son's. God's plain food is to your liking now, I see. Good. Good. I shall return in half an hour, at which time we shall begin anew. (DOOR SHUT AND LOCKED) (MAN SINGING TUNELESSLY) - JOSEPH: Where you go, Anna? - I'm going shopping, dear. JOSEPH: I go? You buy chocolate? ANNA: No. You finish your work, and then you can come in. - JOSEPH: Soon? - ANNA: Yes, as soon as I finish shopping. - Harry not here? - No, he's gone to London for a few days. - Bye. - Bye. (JOSEPH SINGING TUNELESSLY) PAT: Joseph! Would you do a favour for me? I'd like to send this postcard to a friend. Give it to the people at the post office. Oh, and here's some money, Joseph. For the card. Pretty. So! Within minutes of my forgiving you, of my feeding you, you do this! This! (HARD SLAP) You will not learn, will you? You simply will not learn. Well, there will be no food today or tomorrow or the day after! You shall repent! If I have to starve you into repentance, I shall do so. It's not my repentance you're concerned with, it's your own revenge. Revenge is what you're after. I took Stephen from you. At least you think I did in that twisted mind of yours. Do not tax my patience, child. Well, I have news for you, my dear Mrs Trefoile. Nobody had to take Stephen from you. You drove him away. Oh, God! I see. I see exactly why he killed himself. Exactly why he what? Exactly why he what? You didn't know? I never mentioned it in my letter because I couldn't, but... - Lie. Lie! - (HARD SLAP) It's not a lie. He killed himself! He died in a car accident! Which he caused himself. Downstairs. Downstairs! (BELL JANGLING) - Excuse me. - It's all right. Anna, my dear. How are you? You heard my news, of course. - Two and eight. - I wonder if you can... - ...tell me where I can find... - In a moment, sir. - Does the missus owe you any money? - No, she doesn't. How is she? OLD MAN: She's feeling a bit queer, you know? But she's getting better. I hadn't seen her so lovely and relaxed since the summer we spent in Bognor. - You come out... - I wonder, could you...? One moment, sir. Just a moment. Now, let me see. You owe me... And you know what bad arthritis she had. Her hands. But not afterwards. They were beautiful. And her face too. OLD MAN: That's it. - Now, sir. - I'm trying to find Mrs Trefoile. I really must get back. You know, dear, I've got to admit that I was expecting the worst. But Mummy looked just the picture of health and happiness in her grey dress. Well, I don't know. - Mrs Trefoile? - Yeah. - I think she lives down by the river. - ALAN: All right. Thank you very much. And the coffin looked lovely too. I'm sorry to trouble you. Could you tell me where Mrs Trefoile lives? Did you see that woman? She walked away as I was telling her about my poor mother. - I lost her last week, you know? - I'm terribly sorry. - Oh, thank you. - I wonder...? It wasn't as bad as I'd expected. I've never seen her so lovely and relaxed since the summer we spent in Bognor. MRS TREFOILE: There is evil in your blood as there was in his. You had best consider your repentance, child, lest the same fate come to you. Now, listen. "Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee "and shall pursue thee and overtake thee - "till thou be destroyed..." - (DOOR CLOSING) "...because thou hearkenest not unto the voice of the Lord thy God, "to keep his commandments and his statutes - "which he commanded thee." - (FRANTIC KNOCKING) "And they shall be upon..." (CONTINUOUS KNOCKING) He's here, Mrs Trefoile. - What? - He's here. I saw him in the shop. He was asking where your house was. Alan! Gag and bind her. Anna, why are you doing this to me? - Don't you know that Harry's...? - Use your scarf. (CAR STOPPING) (KNOCKING) - Oh, good morning. Mrs Trefoile? - Yes, I am Mrs Trefoile. ALAN: I'm looking for Patricia Carroll. She was staying here. MRS TREFOILE: She was, but she left. - You must be...? - Alan Glentower. Her fiancé, of course. Won't you come in, Mr Glentower? Thank you. MRS TREFOILE: Patricia left yesterday. We were so sorry to see her go. Such a nice girl. ALAN: Well, did she say where she was going, Mrs Trefoile? All I got was this note. MRS TREFOILE: I'm so sorry not to be able to help you further, Mr Glentower. I'm sure it's just a lovers' quarrel. And she will turn up again in a few days, asking your forgiveness. Anna. You remembered. Dear Patricia. She left this behind. - Perhaps when you see her you could, er...? - Yes, of course. I will. Goodbye, Mr Glentower. And when you do see Patricia, please give her our love. ALAN: Thank you, I shall. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) Alan! Filth. Corrupter. Stephen. Yes. (PAT GROANING) (HARD THUD) Leave her to me. Go back to your work. I've just heard Stephen's voice, and I know what I must do. I had hoped to cleanse your soul before releasing you. But now it's too late. That man will be back here, perhaps this very day. Therefore you and Stephen must be reunited now. You must die. Die, my darling. He's here. Waiting for you, child. Waiting for you. Last service. "To thee will I cry, O Lord, my rock, "be not silent to me, lest if thou be silent to me "I become like them that go down into the pit." I shouldn't worry about her, sir. She's probably just hiding from you, just to tease you. - Yeah. - Thank you. The fellow here says that his girlfriend was visiting Mrs Trefoile's. Mrs Trefoile's? Well? Well, how should I know what goes on at Mrs Trefoile's? Oh! Come off it, Gloria. What about that, then? Well, if you must know, Mr Nosy, Harry didn't say. That's all I asked. Thank you very much, sir. Your girl giving you trouble? What? I said, your girl giving you trouble? Don't they all? Yeah, but they're worth it, aren't they? You're cheeky, you are. MRS TREFOILE: "Let the wicked be ashamed. "Let them be silent in the grave. "Let the lying lips be put to silence. "Which speak grievous things, "proudly and contemptuously against the righteous." Pat? Pat! No afraid. No hurt Anna. Where is she? - Where is she? - ANNA: Don't, please! What's the matter with you? Where is she? No hurt Anna. - What I do with him, Anna? - I don't know. Put him in the garage. - No. Can't. Nice lady car. - No. - Might scratch. - No. No, Harry's got the car in London. No, car in there this morning. MRS TREFOILE: So you and Stephen must be reunited now. - Pat! Pat! - In here. (THUMPING) (JOSEPH SCREAMS) ALAN: Oh, my God! No! (MOANING) I'll send for a doctor. And the police. Keep her in there. MRS TREFOILE: Stephen. They hurt me. They hurt me. Stephen. Stephen. They hurt me. Stephen. They hurt me. They hurt me. Alan? Don't shout at me. Why don't you shut up. We're going home.
