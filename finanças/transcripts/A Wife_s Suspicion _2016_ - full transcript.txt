There's no footings! 'Calm down, honey.' Up to your right. Right there, up to your right. 'That's it.' Jack, I can't! You can do it, Renee. Jack! I got you! 'I got you, honey. I got you.' 'You okay?' Yeah. Yeah. Nothing like a Sunday climb. Hang on, I'm gonna start pulling you up, okay? You ready? I got you. Ready? Here we go. That's it. That's it. - That was crazy. - Right? I thought I was gonna fall. - I'm so proud of you. - Whew! I don't know how you think I'm gonna make it back down. Well, I guess I'm just going to have to leave you up here then. Don't you dare. Don't worry, there's a path that leads down to the parking lot. That was great. Always prepared. This is so beautiful. It is. Let's just stay up here for a bit, okay? Speaking of beautiful we should probably take this off. That better be all you're taking. Come on. There's no one up here. Come on, we're alone. Who would see? Jack. Carabiners, colours of the rainbow, go! Red, orange, yellow, green and blue. Well done. Thank you. I love you. I love you. Tim, do you have those test results back from the Ridley case? Sure, boss. Great. Congratulations, too, by the way. Thank you. May I say what an honour it's been to work with you these past couple of years? I feel very lucky to have learned from such a.. ...such a consummate professional, so thank you. Flattery will get you everywhere. - Get back to work. - Roger that, boss. Yeah, I don't like when you call me boss. Sorry. 'Everyone knows that we have the best' 'forensic team on the force.' I want to give props to my partner, Detective Ferguson. 'His relentless work and hard evidence' was just the dagger we needed to put this guy away. Thank you, Detective Knox. It's always a pleasure to catch criminals with you, too. And Renee, your chain of custody on the DNA evidence really helped nail the case shut, so good work. Just doing my job, Kyle. Okay, drinks on Ferguson, Billy Miner Pub, tonight! Whoo! By the way, I put a word in for that promotion. Why would you do that? Well, I was just trying to help. I'm good, Kyle. Alright. Give it up, Ferguson. She dumped your ass a long time ago. Yeah. Cheers! Cheers. You would have made a great detective. You know that's not my thing. I like my science. Matching DNA, identifying fibers.. Stop, please. It's amazing to me that you managed to take that lab coat off and actually marry your man. Honestly, it's a miracle. Truly. Isn't it six months next week? It is already? And by the way, my job is not boring. Oh. See, that's why I love you. She's crazy. You have it all now. - Ah. - How's it going with Kyle? What do you mean? Well, you married his best friend, or.. ...ex-best friend now. Uh, they, I mean, they don't hang out or go climbing anymore but I think that's to be expected. - Time does heal. - Hmm. Well, hello, ladies. Room for one more? 'Yeah, of course.' - Hey, honey. - 'Hey. Hi.' Congrats on cracking another case. Thanks. Thank you. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - It was a team effort. - Yeah. Catch you all later. - Come on, Kyle. - 'Yeah, stay.' Ah, I got a friend waiting for me at the bar. I've already kept him waiting long enough. Wait. Renee, we should have everyone over for dinner. To celebrate. Uh, sounds great. 'Good.' We'll see you later then. Yeah. You don't think this is too soon? We've kept to ourselves for the past few months. Look, enough time has passed, honey. It'll be good for all of us. Trust me. - Alright. - Alright. - I-I disagree. - Yeah? - Come here. - Mm. Anywhere in the world, where would you want to go? - Thailand. - Thailand? Hold that thought. Not tonight. - What if it's work? - What if it's not? Come here. - Alright. - Thank you. Murphy. Yeah, got it. 'So what've we got?' No sign of forced entry. - No struggle. - That's conjecture. Let's find some hard evidence. I talked to the building manager about the surveillance tapes. - Anything? - Nothing yet. Let's go talk to the neighbours. Taking trophies, are we? So what, you think somebody accessed the balcony from up here? It's possible. Looks like the markings of a thick rope. Could it be the window washer? No, it's a single rope. I got something. What is it? It's a carabiner. Climbers use them to keep tension on the ropes. Looks like we found point of entry. Whoever killed our vic repelled down the building and onto the balcony. Well, well. I've done some pretty interesting climbs but I gotta tell you, whoever did this gotta give them points for creativity. 'See anything?' See what you can pull then let's get this off to the lab for possible DNA. Hey. Got anything? Well, nothing yet, but we're still working the evidence. But that murder scene was unusually clean. No prints, no fibers, no hairs. Just the carabiner that Kyle found. No signs of struggle? Did you get the tox results back from the coroner's office? Yeah, prelim said there was no drugs in her system and we're still waiting for the full report but-- Well, whoever did this was good. It's almost impossible not to leave trace evidence at a crime scene. This is definitely not the work of an amateur. Hey, babe. I gotta go. Hey, honey. How was your day? Eh. How was yours? Well, we just found out that the shipment's gonna be late from China which is causing a lot more headaches because of the server breakdown, but.. - I'm sorry to hear. - It'll be fine. - Hungry? - Starving. - Order in? - Done. It's like a cat and a mouse. It takes a sophisticated mind to leave the scene of a crime without any trace of evidence. I mean, those are clear markers that whoever did this wants us to follow them. Huh? Who? The killer. Jack. Right. I gotta get this. Yeah? I'll be right there. I've gotta head back to the office. Our junior tech working nights just screwed up the server problem even more. Well, can't somebody else do it? Renee, I designed the system. 'I'm the only one who can go inside and fix it.' I'm sorry, it's just the way it is. How many late night crime scenes have I attended, right? Seven over the last twelve weeks. But who's counting? I'll talk to you later. Send me updates. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue. Hey. Hi. - Oh, coffee. - Yes. What's up? You seem stressed. Just have my head in the case. That's all. You sure that's it? I didn't sleep last night. - Jack never came home. - Oh. I mean, how many times have I gone off on a case and I don't even come back until the next night, right? Yeah. And marriage is about trust 'cause you're in it for the long haul. And let's face it, you're better off. I mean, Kyle? He must have been a handful. Don't get me wrong, I trust the guy with my life, but outside of work? Kyle is great with his daughter, Sage. She adores him. He is a different person outside of work. I know that his wife's death hit him hard, but.. ...it's Kyle. So what do we have so far? Victim's name is Jessica Greigson thirty-two, lawyer, no priors. No family that we can find as of yet. Cause of death was strangulation. The perp came in through the roof climbed down the side of the building into the victim's balcony. Coroner said there were very few signs of a struggle very few ligature marks on the body. The hemorrhage indicates one instance of strangulation. I mean, if it was a possible sex game there would be numerous attempts where he allows her to regain consciousness in between. Well, the coroner report hasn't come back final yet so let's just stay on topic. I know I've seen this rope placement before. Look at the facts, not theories. I'm going to go through the cold cases. - Renee. - I've seen this before. 'Kyle, let her finish.' I-I'm the lead detective on this case, alright? That means follow my lead, not follow your imagination. I'm in charge. Then you know that when a murderer uses a rope much like a knife, it's personal. Take a look at this binding. It is meticulous, methodical. Very precise. Premeditated. And the chunk of hair he's taking as a trophy post-mortem. This guy is playing us. Are you done yet? Okay, so anyone else have any ideas, theories? Kyle? I gotta get back to work and find some real clues. - Renee.. - Kyle-- What the hell do you think you're doing? Communicating my findings. That's not communicating, that's dictating. And sometimes these creative ideas of yours lead us down a road away from the facts. Oh, and yours don't? I chase the facts. I produce results. Look, I am just giving credible evidence to help us catch a killer. That's my job. And if you're having a hard time separating work from our past.. You're right. You're right, I'm sorry. Maybe I am guilty of still caring a bit. This is still my investigation. I know. I'm sorry, too. But let's just focus on finding the killer. Agreed. - We good? - Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. You know he's just jealous because your forensic work is saving all his cases, right? What's wrong? Are you getting over-involved in this case already? Look, I just.. I know I've seen that before. It's like it's in the back of my head and I can't pull it out. Renee, remember the last time you got obsessed with a case and you asked me to tell you 'when it was happening again?' So it's happening again. Maybe I am too obsessive for my own good. And maybe Kyle is right. Just concentrate on the facts. Whoever did this, we're gonna get him. Tim, where is the Greigson file? Apologies. Um, Detective Ferguson asked for some other case files done pronto. I- I got behind. Well, you can tell Detective Ferguson that he needs to ask me before he tells my department what they should be doing. - Okay? - Copy that, yeah. We get any DNA back on the carabiner? I, uh, I didn't get a chance to get it off yet. Did you pull a print? Yeah, um, but I was only able to pull a partial and unfortunately it's not enough to, uh to pull a print from our database. Tim, everything needs to be checked and vetted, okay? 'And I need you to pull cold cases.' All the murders of women in the past five years. And get this to the lab. You got it. Hey. Hey. I didn't mean to wake you. Where have you been? Where have you been? Honey, look.. I'm sorry about the other night. I lost track of time. It looks like we both need boundaries at work. It's that crazy work ethic gene of ours. We got too much of it, right? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. I love you. I love you, too. Come to bed. 'Well, she's got him well trained.' He loves to cook. Could he be any more perfect? - Seriously? - Apparently not. Good-looking, intelligent, athletic.. 'And he's a successful entrepreneur.' Hey, Jade. I haven't seen you at the precinct lately. Yeah, I've been out on surveillance. Not my favourite, but duty calls. I'll get that. - Renee! - Sage, aw. You are more beautiful every time I see you. Are you still running track? Uh, yeah, we've got a race next week. Can you come? We're pretty busy at work. But um... I'll try. Okay. Everyone's in the back. Can I take your coat? Yeah. Thanks. You've got a beautiful house. Aw! Thank you, sweetie. - She is something. - Huh. Her mom would be proud. Yeah, I wish Holly were alive to see her. She could use another female influence in her life. Well, uh, maybe I could take her shopping or to the park sometime? Renee, that would be great. Really. Hey, Kyle. I'm glad you guys could make it. Jack. Scotch? - Yeah, this sounds great. - Right this way. Jade? Are you looking for something? Oh, I just needed my phone. You know me, can't go anywhere without it. Hey. Hi. So how's it going? Good. How's Jack with Kyle around? Jack's great. Kyle's a little off. Any plans to meet Jack's family? I mean, I guess the elopement kind of nixed that. We're talking about taking a trip to visit them next year. Great. You guys are perfect. Any new leads? The CCTV cameras in the building weren't working and nothing on the cameras in the area. We'll figure it out. We'll find something. The barbecue was amazing. Thank you. I'm glad. You're welcome. Oh, Sage was so sweet, don't you think? I'm gonna take her to the park on Sunday. Are you sure that's such a good idea? Why wouldn't it be? Well, things are still a little.. ...uncomfortable with Kyle. I thought they were better tonight. But this isn't about Kyle. Sage was caught in the crossfire.. ...and I miss her. Okay. Jack? She's a little girl. I understand. I was thinking, I want us to start planning that vacation to see your family. Yeah. Sure, that'd be great. But... it's been a long day. Been cooking all day, and I got some work to do can we talk about it tomorrow? Please? Okay. Good. I'm just gonna get ready for bed. There's a school dance comin' up. Oh, that sounds fun. Do you have a date? Renee. Yeah, it's a lot but I'm looking forward to it all. Hey, you know that if you ever wanna ask me anything you just have to call, right? Well, I do have a question that I've wanted to ask for a while. Okay, what is it? How come you married Jack and not my dad? Oh, honey. I'm so sorry I didn't talk to you about this before. Your dad and I just weren't getting along. You still work together, though. Mm-hm. It's complicated, Sage. Well, what did your dad say? He said you didn't like him anymore. Well, that is not true. He's a good dad. But what I know for sure.. ...is he has one amazing daughter. Morgan, hey, I am so sorry I forgot to call you. 'It's alright. You still want to meet up?' I can't, uh, I'm outside Jack's office. Wanna surprise him for lunch. - Yeah. Gotta go. - I'll see you later, then. - Hey. - Hi. 'How was your day?' Good. Just catching up on some work. Well, I'm beat, I'm gonna have a shower and crawl into bed. How was your day? Well, we had to reboot the servers again. Solved one problem, which leads to another one but that's the computer biz for ya. - Jack? - Yeah. Is everything alright? Yeah, everything's fine. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm good. Alright, I'll see you upstairs. 'Don't work too late.' Hey. I think I have something on the Greigson case. Apparently our dead girl was part of a group for ex-junkies. Narcotics no More. I'm gonna head down, check it out see what I can find. Anything on that fingerprint? - Nothing yet. - 'Let me know.' Renee? Do you mind if I have a seat? Uh, sure. I just wanted to say, uh.. ...that Sage was really happy to spend some time with you. I mean, she came home and she was.. ...in the greatest of moods, she was just.. She's a great kid. You did an amazing job with her. Thanks. What about you and Jack? 'You're so great with Sage, you..' '...you guys ever think about having kids?' Um. I hit a sore spot. Uh, no, we just, we're both focused on our work that's all. Well, maybe you should take some time off. Get to know each other better. Wow, when did you become the relationship expert? Yeah, well.. I guess, I learned my lesson the hard way. It's not always about the job. 'Better late than never, I guess.' I'm really sorry how things ended between us. Me too. Jack's a lucky guy. Always has been. Thank you. Uh, I have some work, I have to do. Yeah, sure. Hey. 'Honey?' Hey. You're home late. I had some things to finish up at work and some errands to run. How are you? Pretty good, actually. 'We got a lead in the Jessica Greigson case.' Wow. Yeah, it turns out she's a member of a support group. 'Narcotics No More?' 'You heard of it?' Narcotics No More? Um... yeah. Yeah, a friend of mine used to go there. But that was a long time ago. Huh. Listen, I'm gonna go watch some TV you wanna join me? No, I've got some work to do. - You sure? - Hm-mm. Alright. I love you. Hey, Tim. - Why don't you take a break? - You sure? Yeah, we've been working around the clock. It would be good to catch up on a few things. Hey, anything come back from the lab? Uh, nothing yet. There was a strange anomaly though. 'I wanted to confirm before mentioning it to you' but some of the boxes were mixed up and I can't find case number 52899. 'The file and box are both missing.' Well, who pulled the files? Ferguson. 'Did you want me to go check the storage?' No, no. I'm fine. Go home. You sure? I mean, I can stay a bit longer I was on my way there anyway. Get out of here. Alright. So what have we got? "Steven Boyden?" Drugs? Assault? Oh, my God! Hello? Hello? "96, 97, 98.. ...99." Where are you, 99? You didn't see anyone? No, I thought I heard something but I didn't see anything. - Do you want me to call Jack? - No, I'm fine. The cold case file that I was looking for? It's missing. What would someone want with a cold case? I don't know. Well, that's certainly weird, isn't it? You signed everything out. You didn't notice it was missing? Are you accusing me of something? I only went off of your hunch to look at the cold cases. Renee, he's right. Tsk. This has to be related to the Greigson murder. Why don't I just take you home, you can get some rest. What's the number of the file? I'll go look for it. 52899. What? 52899. Kyle? Kyle, what is it? 52899, that's.. ...Holly's murder case file. What? What does Holly's murder have to do with the Greigson case? What's the number? '52899.' It's gone. Her file's not in the system. - It's been wiped. - Hey, that's impossible. You'd have to have police clearance or be a really good computer hacker to get through our firewall. Renee! 'Kyle. Are you okay?' 'You okay?' Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I just need a moment. You guys go. I'll catch up. What? I didn't work Holly's case but I think I remember the crime scene photos. She was strangled but I think the ropes were similar. That's why the file has disappeared. And that has to be the connection. Come on, I'm gonna take you home. We can figure this out in the morning. Renee, you need sleep. Jack? I thought I was over it. Your wife was murdered. That's not something you just get over. You have to give yourself a break? I tried counseling, I really did. I know. I'd do it every day of the week if I thought it would help me get over how it all went down but nothing seems to work. You have to let someone in. I know. I know. But we both know it's not that easy. You really think there's a connection between the murders? Holly's? I think Holly's was the first.. ...and then the killer got a taste for murder and systematically chose his next victim. Don't you see the similarities with the ropes between Holly and the the Greigson case? And files don't just magically disappear, Kyle. Someone is trying to hide something. That beautiful, creative mind of yours that never stops. Life isn't just one big conspiracy theory, you know. I miss you. And I know I messed up. And I know it's probably too late.. ...but I'd let you in if you could give me another chance. 'Hi, honey.' In here. Jack, how are ya, buddy? Kyle. I was just leaving. Thanks for the talk, Renee. I'll see you around, Jack. - Working late again? - What's he doing here? We need to talk. Renee, is something going on between you and Kyle? We were talking about a case. I'm sorry, it just seems a little odd. You're in our house, alone, with him. One, he's a colleague. And two, you don't get to tell me who I can be friends with. I'm not trying to tell you who or who you cannot be friends with, Renee but I know him very well or have you forgotten that? I'm sorry. I'm jealous. Alright? Satisfied? What? Steven Boyden. Renee.. Look, I-I wanted to tell you about my past.. ...I did. 'But I was afraid if I, if I did I'd lose you.' 'And I couldn't do that.' So I kept it a secret. I-I kept it a secret from everyone. I've worked really hard to put Steven Boyden behind me. I did some time, and I paid for what I did. I'm not the same guy, Renee. You have to believe that. Why do you still go to Narcotics No More? You've been following me? I'm a cop, Jack. And who's that blonde woman? What do you mean, Bess? 'Oh, honey.' Baby, uh.. I'm her sponsor. - A sponsor? - 'Yeah.' Part of the program is about getting second chances and I believe in second chances. 'That's why I didn't tell you about Steve Boyden.' Sometimes you don't get second chances and I couldn't risk losing you. I am so sorry, Renee. Please forgive me. I forgive you. What is going on? Holly's file that went missing triggered a security breach. Now they got us on lockdown until we can find it. - Have they been to the lab? - They're everywhere. Locusts. Morgan, call Jade. Let's re-work some of the Greigson leads. I've been trying her since this morning it goes straight to the voice mail. See? You can't do this. I have active files. Is there a problem, and who are you? I'm Renee Murphy. - Who are you? - Abbey Coleman. Your new problem. I need that computer to do my work. I'm sure there's something you can occupy your time with, Murphy. I have personal files. Well, you shouldn't. You know how many hours I log in here? There's been a breach, if you haven't already heard. I'll need you to step aside until this investigation is done. And how long will that take? As long as it takes. Excuse me. Renee? Looks like we have a fresh crime scene. - I'll meet you there. - Okay. Attend to your duties, Murphy. And I'll attend to mine. Stay out of my way. Kyle? What's going on? It's... Jade. That is three dead girls all with the exact same rope pattern. This is a serial killer. Kyle, does Jade remind you of Holly? Same age, same hair. I mean, there are some similarities. Yeah, maybe she reminded him of someone. An ex-lover, family member. Serial killers tend to go after types. Are you suggesting this has something to do with Holly? Can you think of anyone, like someone who was bothering her? She was a cop. There was always someone. I mean, she, she had an edge. I think you're overthinking this, Renee. That is my job. Well, what about the fact that nobody knew Jessica Greigson? I mean, if your theory is correct there are many other victims between her and Holly. Maybe Jade got on his radar through the case. - 'This area is blocked off.' - 'Hey, hey..' Maybe he's watching us. - Hey, Tim, take it easy. - Oh, Jade. - C-come on. T-take it easy. - What happened? Take it easy. Come on. - Uh, let's go. Come with me. - What happened? 'What happened, Jade?' 'Gotcha.' Special Agent Coleman wants to see you. Okay, I'm just gonna take this to the lab. No. She wants to see you now. - Morgan, what is going on? - I can't say. - 'Renee.' - Jack? It's okay, honey. It's okay. Call my lawyer. - I didn't do this! - Come on. I didn't do this! I love you! Morgan, what is going on? You know that I can't say anything. 'Just do me a favor and don't incriminate yourself.' Your husband has done that for you. What? Just answer the questions, Renee, and you'll be fine. You haven't done anything wrong, right? Let's go. Have a seat. We found evidence on your computer. What evidence? The partial prints from the Greigson case came back from the lab. 'It's a match to the print that you hid' in your personal folder. They both connect to a Steven Boyden. 'That's your husband Jack's alias, isn't it?' There has to be some mistake. How long have you known your husband is a killer? He is not a killer. But you found out his real name. His past. What did he say when you confronted him? He didn't deny it. And since, when is a man proven guilty without any real evidence? He has a rap sheet that I would say is a precursor to murder. I need your help here, Renee. I don't want you to lose your job and your husband. Something made you suspect him enough to run his prints through the system. Are you charging me with something? Do I need a lawyer? Look. If you cooperate with us things may go easier on you in the future. Are you threatening me? That wouldn't be wise. That partial print won't hold up in court and the print I took wasn't a legal search. But you already know that. So unless you have something real, we're done. I'd have a seat. You have nothing. I have enough to temporarily remove you from your duties. Fine. - Renee. - I.. I'm sending the CSI team to your house. We are waiting for a warrant. Take these keys. Take the keys. Go to my house. Don't talk to anyone except for your lawyer, got it? Alright, guys, head on in. - Hey. - Hi. Uh, can I sit in on the meeting? Sure. I'm Bess. Renee. Attending a meeting is the first step in recovery. Everyone's here to support you. I have a friend who goes here, Jack Murphy. Yeah, I know Jack. He's a great guy. How long have you known him? He's my sponsor. Without him I'd be back on the street. He's helped a lot of people here. The meeting's about to start. Come on in. Hey, everyone. Welcome to this week's meeting. I just want to remind everyone that this is a safe place. A place for healing and for sharing 'so let's be welcoming and warm' 'to those who need to share tonight.' Dad should be home any minute. I never knew you were so handy in the kitchen. Well, it's either that or starve. Hey, dad, how was your day? It was great, sweetheart, how was yours? It was pretty good. Dinner's not quite ready. So I'm gonna do a bit more homework. - Alright, kiddo. - Okay. How are you? I'm waiting to hear back from Jack's lawyer. He could be out as early as tomorrow. Kyle, I'm not going to give up on him. You know I can't talk about the details of this investigation with you. I know, I know. So please, just listen. Renee. I saw him with another woman. And I was angry and jealous, and I jumped to conclusions but I was wrong. He's a sponsor in a drug recovery program. I just came from there. She didn't know that I was his wife. He's not lying. And he never mentioned this before? I mean, it's like he's hidden his entire life from you. Because he was scared that his past would affect our future. That I wouldn't understand. Don't people deserve a second chance? Yes, I get that. And a second chance is what I-- Kyle, please. Is a fingerprint all they have? So somebody could have planted it. We don't know that for sure. I got something. - What's that? - It's a carabiner. Climbers use them to keep tension on the ropes. 'You ran his prints.' 'I don't think you're as sure about this as you think.' - I need to go home. - I think you should stay. I really have to go. Okay. Your place is probably clear by now. 'You have reached the law offices of Stoijko and Young.' 'Please leave a detailed message and we will return your call.' Hi, this is Renee Murphy. I'm calling to get an update on my husband, Jack Murphy. Please call me back as soon as possible. Jack, are you alright? 'Yeah, I just got released.' - Really? - 'Yeah. I'll explain later.' - I'm on my way. - 'Alright, thanks.' - 'Hey, honey?' - Yeah? 'I love you.' I love you, too. See you soon. Hi. Oh. Hmm. What happened? The DA decided there wasn't enough evidence to go to a jury. - So it's over? - I'm a free man. Umm. Take this free man home. He needs a shower. - What happened? - I don't know. The investigators asked me for a list of names of the guys I climb with, and.. I don't know. I guess someone stole some of my equipment and they're thinking somebody's trying to frame me. I'm just glad it's over. Jack. What is it? I have something I have to tell you. When I saw you with Bess.. '...I ran your fingerprints.' That's how they had them to match with the evidence. This is my fault. You're a cop. I get it. You're just doing your job. Baby, I am so sorry. Let it go. Alright? It's over. Come here. I think somebody's really trying to get a hold of you. Tsk. Well, they are just gonna have to wait. Coleman wants to see you. Hey. Uh.. So listen, I'm... sorry about before. I was following orders. Okay. Have a seat. - Leaving so soon? - My job here is done. All the access codes have been changed. Sign this for clearance, please. No hard feelings? You were just doing your job. And you were just doing yours. Am I back on the Greigson case? And Jade's? The perp is still out there, so lots to do. Thank you. Thank you. I'm glad I was wrong about your husband. Me too. New sign in procedure. You have to initial here, here, and here. You okay? Yeah. Getting there. You? Better. We've got a lot of work to do. That lockdown cost us valuable time. Yeah. Any evidence access is logged manually and on the computer. Great. I'm going to need you to get me back up to speed on the cases. Done. And it's, it's nice to have you back. It's nice to be back. Expedite this to the lab, label it urgent. I'll run it over right now. - 'Jack.' - Hey. Where are you? It's the middle of the night. Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm still at the station. You said you were going to stop these late nights, remember? I think we had a break-through. What, you found the killer? 'We have a possible lead.' That's great. I knew you'd find the right guy. 'Now, can you please come home, honey?' Okay. I'll see you soon. Hey. I need you to come down here. Right now. What's up? We got a hit off the hair from Jade's crime scene. I thought that was gonna take days. It would if it was an unknown. But not if it's already in our database. I don't like where this is going. Who is it? It's Tim. Tim? 'Couldn't this wait until morning?' Renee got a hit off the hair at Jade's crime scene. - What'd you bring up? - 'It's Tim.' No, no, no, no, no, it's gotta be a cross-contamination at the crime scene. I worked the body. I came in first, he came in after me. He didn't go near Jade. He was too upset to work the crime scene. She's right. She was the only one who went anywhere near Jade. It could also explain the computer hacking. Alright, I'll get a search warrant to search his home. Morgan, bring him in. - How's it coming? - He's asking for you. I can't get anything out of him. Maybe he'll talk to you. 'How are you doing?' Renee, they, they got it all wrong. I would never hurt Jade. But you did.. ...have a personal relationship with her, didn't you? I loved Jade. We had a thing for a while. We didn't tell anyone but I wanted to make it official. And how about Jade? How did she feel about that? Not the same as me. I think there was someone else. She started acting all funny. She said she had a friend she had to meet. I could tell it was another guy. Did she say who it was? No. That must have made you pretty upset. I would never hurt her. I loved her. God, I swear, I swear, Renee. I couldn't do that to anyone, especially her. You gotta help me here. Now give me some more personal details about Jade. Uh, she was, she was very private.. ...but I could tell she had some problems from the past. How? Like what? She went through a lot of therapy. Psychiatrists? Psychologist? Counsellor? No. No. Not AA, something else. Some, some organization. Help me here. She's an ex-drug addict. Wait! You believe me, don't you? Renee! No. Jade? Are you looking for something? Oh, I just needed my phone. You know me, can't go anywhere without it. Oh, you bastard. Renee? Tim's out on bail and I can't find Kyle. Do you know where he is? 'No, I have no idea where he is.' Well, could you call him? Maybe he'll pick up for you. Sure. 'Where are you?' Uh, I'm at home. I just, uh, stopped by to change my clothes. I'll see you shortly. Okay, let me know if you get him please. Red, orange, yellow, green. No blue. Hey. Hey, I just got a text from Tim. He has Jack. What? Tim has Jack? I don't understand. 'He's at Devil's Punch Bowl right now.' You're cutting out, Renee. I can't.. Devil's Punch Bowl. 'Renee!' Just stop right there! - What? - It is over, Jack. I know what you did. You need to turn yourself in. What are you talking about? Tim's the one who kidnapped me, he's the killer. I found the storage locker. 'The police are there right now.' Kyle and Morgan are on their way here. You know, when you lie you get this.. ...dimple on the side of your cheek. Right here. Did you know that? Nobody's coming, Renee. S-stay right there, I am warning you. 'Or what?' You're gonna fingerprint me? All those women. Holly, Jennifer, Jade. You. Why, Jack? "Why not" I think is the appropriate question. Jade helped you frame Tim. Didn't she? 'But she didn't know that you would turn on her.' - Why, Jack? - Because it's a game, Renee. You should know that. I mean, Holly was the hardest but.. Jade... was kinda fun. So you were just biding your time with me? No. No, no, honey, you were different than the others. Well, you.. 'You showed me respect and... comfort.' Uh, I thought that I could grow to love it. I thought I could grow to love you. That's because you're incapable of love. Sociopaths relate to obsession. You'll never find love. 'Renee!' Then I guess you'll just gonna have to meet the others. 'Renee!' 'Renee!' It was Jack. Are you okay? - 'We've always been close.' - 'I don't know about that.' - But we make a good team. - Yeah. Well, well. All hail the new head of CSI. Thank you. It's gonna be hard losing one of the department's best. But I guess when the big guns call, you gotta go. We gotta go. Congratulations. Renee, you deserve every bit of this. Thank you. How are you doing? I'm getting there. - Well, you look great. - Thank you. You need a drink, is what you need. Well, I always knew you'd make head of CSI someday. I just want to say I'm sorry if I was ever hard on you. That is okay. I get it. And hey, listen, I mean now that we're officially not working together not even in the same precinct.. ...maybe we could.. ..Take a walk sometime. You know, with, with Sage. I'd like that. I thought that was funny. She's like, oh, my God! Yeah. - Here you go. - Thanks. Thank you. Ah, such a nice day for a walk. Thanks for the invite. - Shall we? - Yes.
