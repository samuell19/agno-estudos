With its epicenter about 20km underneath Awajima Island... ...the quake registered an intensity of 7.2 on the Richter Scale. On Awajima, and in the cities of Kobe and Osaka... ...large numbers of buildings have collapsed, and fires broken out. Many of the dead and missing are believed trapped beneath the rubble. "I have food if you're hungry." Nishinomiya Sports Center Hello. Is there anything you need? What now? I'm so tired! I can 't even cry... Will there be another earthquake? Where will we all live? I need a bath! My house and my store are gone. Now what? My mind's a blank. I can 't think anymore. Why? Why?! Why can I hear all their thoughts? Go change Mr. Nakayama's bandage. And speak loudly. Sir, be reasonable, will you? We don't have any sleeping pills! You say you "ran away," but live alone. You didn't cause anyone any trouble. Here. Drink this and try to sleep. Ow! That's hot! What's wrong with you? Excuse me? Sir? You damn do-gooder! How would any of you know how we feel?! Hey! You don't know what it's like! Forgive me! All I could do was run! I was afraid of what would happen if they caught me! Forgive me! Stop blaming yourself. I mean... ...it was war, wasn't it? I don't think your fallen comrades would hate you for it. In fact, they'd probably be glad that at least one of you survived. I ran away! I abandoned my unit! Forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me! Why are you sleeping here? We'll put a futon here. I'll help. OK. Move those books, will you? Child Psychology I'm a psychiatric counselor. I work at a high school. Oh, really? But that old man had me beat. I never dreamed he'd be having flashbacks! How did you know that? Oh, you know... What kind of work do you do? Nothing, at the moment. Why did you come all the way from Tokyo to volunteer? I thought maybe even I could be of some help. Oh. Just who is this girl anyway? Excuse me... ...may I use the washroom? What am I doing here? Who am I? Who am I? Why am I here? Who am I? Who am I? Who? Do you know what this is? No. It's a Baum Test. Subjects draw a tree, which depicts the image they have of themselves. What do you think? Well, um... I get the sense that they're all a bit unstable. These were all done by one girl. Have you ever heard of "Multiple Personality Disorder"? Good morning. Look at that! She's back! Really! It was her! Good morning. What did she say to him? It's just like that guy said... those do-gooders are trouble! Some "volunteer"! She must have said something. Why else would he kill himself? Shh! I thought the old man was starting to do a lot better. Why did he do it? I guess he just made up his mind. Why else would he commit suicide? "When the cranes and turtles all fall down... "...who's right behind you now?" "Guess who?" Tomomi! Right! You're it! Disaster Relief All aboard, anyone going east! Look at this! Our part of town is in ruins! Just a little way away and it's like a different city! I'm so tired... Two hours to get to work, three to get back... Give me a break! Antipsychotics? Watch your step. There you go... Take care. Need any help? No, thanks. Who's she? I don't know. Here. Thanks. You were chased by a dog yesterday, weren't you? No. Near the emergency center... Chihiro! What brings you here? That old man from yesterday... apparently he killed himself. I should have minded my own business. It wasn't your fault. You came to Kobe to help people. It's important to remember that. What were you two talking about? Huh? She drew those pictures I showed you. Akane drowned herself in a toilet bowl! Can you really kill yourself that way? I bet Chihiro made her do it! Careful! Lt'll be your turn next. You'll wake up and she'll be there by your bed! She's reading that dictionary again! Shinobu: "to endure." She's so creepy! You hungry, honey? I make it good! You're the girl from this morning... Listen... What? You scared to die? Stop it! Fuck off. Are you OK? Why? You don't remember? Who was that? Sho. And you are? My name is Hitomi. Is the car burning? Mommy and Daddy died. I floated up into the sky. YddaD ymmoM An out-of-body experience? Thirteen personalities? I have no idea which of them is doing what. Who's this? Iso-la? "Isola" comes from... ...The Tales of Moonlight and Rain. Her father had the book. She reads it all the time. The Ugetsu Monogatari... Yes? Ms. Nomura, could I see you for a moment? All right. I'll be back. There is no way I can understand the pain you must be going through... ...but I want you to know you're not alone. What kind of tree is this? A strangler tree. A what? It's a tropical plant. It grows around a tree, like ivy... ...and kills it. But even when the tree inside has rotted completely away... ...the strangler tree still holds its shape. Who drew this? What's wrong? Hey! Sho "Character meaning and origin: "A wound or injury inflicted by a sword." I'm Noriko. "A dog run over by a car." A "dog"? I am Shuri..."shu..." Character meaning and origin: "To kill with vengeance." "Kill..." "Kill... eradicate... die..." "Kill... eradicate... die..." "Kill... eradicate... die..." Isola Ugetsu Monogatari We've heard a lot about "endorphins" in recent years. The sublime experiences once ascribed to religion... ...can now be interpreted as one facet of endorphin activity. Death causes the greatest stress to the human organism... Isola dies, hating Shotaro for his infidelity. Her hatred lives on as an evil spirit. She kills his lover Sode, then comes for Shotaro himself. Plagued by Isola, who appears by night... ...he seeks the aid of a diviner. He watches for daybreak, on the 49th day since her death... ...when he need fear her no more. And now, "It's morning! Morning has come!" "Wait!" "Isola has set a trap!" He opens the door... but outside it is still dark! Poor Shotaro dies, victim of the curse of Isola! How fearsome is a woman 's jealousy! And the malice of Isola, so strong it makes her a wraith... ...who carries Shotaro away! - Psycho! - Killer! Get out of here! Freak! Moritani... where were you in periods 5 and 6? You skipped, didn't you? Well? I wouldn't know. Toko says she doesn't know, Yoko says she doesn't know either... Hitomi's only five so she can't say. Mitsuru never says anything. Sho just comes out to hurt me. Shuri says she doesn't know... I asked you where you were! Damn you! Now you're cursed... Chihiro! What's wrong? Excuse me... ...do you know where Chihiro Moritani's room is? And you are? Me? I'm her father. She's in there. And who are you? I'm a volunteer with "Heart Care." You're not associated with that loudmouth woman, are you? Sorry? "Out-of-body" or something... she uses kids as guinea pigs. Takano, that's her name. From Nishinomiya University. You're a friend of Yayoi Takano's, aren't you? Mr. Moritani? Oh, it's the other one... I'm sorry. She hit her head really hard, so I thought I should bring her here. Whatever. I'm getting her discharged. - Chihiro! - Wait! Don't tell me how to handle my own daughter. I'll file a complaint. Chihiro! Chihiro! Come on, let's go! It's all right. I'll go. Come on, Chihiro. Yayoi Takano... Strange Deaths at Area High School Could Chihiro really be a wraith that kills people? Dr. Yayoi Takano was killed in the earthquake. The poor woman... it happened here. Here at the university? The old building suffered severe damage. Excuse me. - Um... - Yes? Could I talk with someone who was close to Dr. Takano? Well, there's Dr. Manabe, in Psychopharmacology. But he's off today. Is there anything else? No, thank you. Excuse me! You want to know about Dr. Takano? I can tell you about her. You know... ...when she died, apparently she was stark naked. And she had this white sort of paste all over her. She was all sticky. Her hair and everything. What was it? What was that stuff? Something about sulfur... Nothing strong or poisonous... not sulfuric acid or anything... Everyone around here thought she was strange. And I'm sure she was up to something in that lab. If you've got some time later... Miyashita! Coming! Dr. Kazuhiko Manabe Dr. Yayoi Takano Magnesium sulfate... What are you doing here? Nobody's allowed in here. Kazuhilko Manabe Can I help you? My name's Yukari Kamo. I knew Dr. Takano. You worked with her... Look, this building is dangerous. Please leave. That was stupid. Why would you go there? Don't tell me you believe in "Chihiro's curse" as well! No, just the opposite. I wanted to find out... ...why Dr. Takano was interested in Chihiro's near-death experience. I see... l'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you. Maybe I'm just tired. What with the earthquake, then all these deaths... Everyone's going berserk. And I've got to deal with them. One more thing... What's magnesium sulfate? Magnesium sulfate? Well, it's soluble in water... It seems that Dr. Takano had it in her hair and on her body. Just a minute... You said she was naked when she died? They used it to make people float in those "isolation tanks"... ...where they used to meditate. A tank... Maybe she was in one of those. For now... l'll let you stay alive. Chihiro! It must be hard losing your classmates and a teacher, too. Not particularly. They weren't friends. I understand why you'd say that. They gave you a hard time. But that's over now, isn't it? It's hard, but why don't you forgive... Shouldn't you be more worried about yourself? You come here all the way from Tokyo to volunteer... Have you found yourself yet? Who are you? You're afraid of what's in people's hearts, yet you can't help peering in. How can you help me if you can't help yourself? Who are you? What are you doing here? Who am I? What am I doing here? What are you doing here? Who am I? What am I doing here? Who are you? What are you doing here? I said nobody's allowed in here. This is the stuff that splashed out of that tank, isn't it? This is a sensory deprivation tank, isn't it? When you're in it, you have hallucinations... ...and even things like near-death out-of-body experiences. Was Yayoi Takano using this tank for an out-of-body experience? That's none of your business. It is my business! Three people are dead. You might laugh, but I think they were killed by an out-of-body spirit... ...that has taken over a girl named Moritani Chihiro. Was she here? Why do you ask? Will you tell me what happened here? What are you to that girl? Why should I tell you? What's your connection with her? That girl... ...is me. Moritani What do you want? Chihiro lost her parents in a car accident when she was five. My wife and I took pity on her and raised her ourselves. It was very hard on us. Chihiro isn't dead yet, is she? No. Let's think about this... If she doesn't die... ...my brother's property and insurance all goes to her. Whoever adopts her will have it. I guess she's never gotten over the crash. That's why she's so difficult. Is that all? What do you mean? That's not her only problem. The main reason she's ill... ...is that you've been abusing her. What? Please... ...I won't tell anyone. Just don't torment Chihiro any more than you already have. You bitch! Mind your own business! Come here! "Counselor" or whatever you are, you fill her head with all that crap... ...telling her things... ...that make her even crazier! So let's have no more... ...wild accusations. What do you want? Come on. I... followed you. I wanted to know what you were up to. So it's true... ...about that girl. You were right. Yayoi died during an experiment. We were studying out-of-body experience. Out-of-body... When Yayoi died... ...I was here, too. That was the first time our experiments had succeeded. I didn't think separation was possible, but she never doubted it would work. She'd had a near-death experience herself once. That's why she was sure it could be done. You all right? And then, suddenly, it appeared... Data that could only mean she had separated. All brain activity had stopped, but her heartbeat was normal. I was stunned. Every second that she was gone seemed like an age. And then, suddenly... I ran! I abandoned her and ran away. But did she really die? I identified her. Certainly her body died. But she'd already left her body, hadn't she? But then... Anyway, she'd have no body to come back to. What if, with no body to come back to, her spirit was left out there drifting? And then she found a place among the fragmented personalities... ...that inhabited Chihiro? Tales of Moonlight and Rain "Isola" may have been the last thing Yayoi saw. You damn freak! I'll kill you... ...before you kill me! - I'm sorry for your loss. - Thank you for coming. Chihiro's not here, is she? I need your help. All of you emerged in order to protect Chihiro... ...with one exception. It can do things the rest of you can't. When people mistreat Chihiro, it takes revenge. And it's influencing all of you. So what's your point? It's you! If you want to talk to me, just say so. All right, I will. I know what you're doing. I want you to stop. Stop what? Killing people. Oh, the killing. Of whom? "Whom"? Anyone! Why don't you just say it? Dr. Manabe, right? It's you... I'm glad you came. Sit down. Um... I abandoned her. I killed her. You didn't kill her. In an earthquake that strong... ...it was all you could do to save yourself. Can you... ...read people's minds? We should get out of here. You're the next one Yayoi means to kill. Could it be... ...that she can't stand the light? Earlier you said that girl Chihiro was you. Yes. Why are you so anxious to help her that you'd put yourself in danger? Could you tie this? I've always hated that I could read minds. It's never brought anything good. It's just destroyed my faith in people. Even in my own family. Then I met Chihiro. She was just like me... ...suffering because no one would accept her for who she was. We both need a place to belong. I wanted to give her a place where she would be safe with me... ...no matter what happened. By doing that, maybe I could start over again... ...with my own family. But it won't work. I can't help anyone. I'm useless. I can't help anyone! You're wrong. What? You can help. You helped me. You really think so? Yes. Read my mind. - Keep her from going out-of-body? - Yeah. We used a psychotropic drug to start the process. Maybe if I give Chihiro something that blocks hallucinations... Let's try it. Then we'll just have to keep her on the medication. Chihiro! Can we talk? I'd like to ask you a favor. Chihiro? Are you OK? I guess so. But it's never been this bad before. I'll get the medication. You wait here. It's getting dark. Let's go! No. We'll look as long as we can. Think! Where would Yayoi go? Her "place"? The tank? We're in time! Who's right behind you now? Guess who! Hey, Yukari... Yayoi? You're dead. Go back where you belong. Oh? And where is it you belong? Shall I show you? As pretty as you are, I'm sure it was easy to make Manabe fall for you. Stop it, Yayoi! Dr. Manabe! It's easy to watch a person die when it's someone you don't care about. It's a lot harder when it's someone you love. Yayoi! I was wrong. That experiment was a mistake. That's all right. I wanted to do it. All right, then... ...l'll give you this body. That's the only thing I can do for you now. You don't mean that. I'll do whatever you want. Take my body, and live in it for the rest of your life. Is this proposal... ...serious? Or do you just want to save your little girlfriend? I'm serious. This is the drug we used in the experiment. If you went out-of-body with it, it should let you come into mine, too. Dr. Manabe! No! I open my heart and mind completely to you. Yayoi, come into me. Be one with me. Come on... ...quickly... ...while I'm still conscious. You really mean it? Yes... ...I mean it. Do you... ...want to become one with me? Yes. Come into me... ...now. Whether you're sincere or not... I'm happy. You meant to do that right from the start, didn't you? Yeah. I never guessed... It's all right. Anyway, you made it possible. Because I met you... Because you were here. Dr. Manabe? No! Don't do it! Thank you. Where am I? Who are you? Chihiro Moritani. I'm glad you came. It's been a while. Chihiro's looking well. After the incident, she split into as many as 200 personalities. She's finally back down to 13. It will take a little more time. I've been meaning to ask you... ...who are you really? Me? I'm... ...a psychic. Yeah, that's a good one! Dr. Nomura! Who is she right now? She's called Shoko. A new persona. Written with the character for "aspire." Sounds optimistic, doesn't it? Yes.
