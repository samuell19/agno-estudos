Well, it's good to be on the move again. All the way down, he kept starin' at the sky. Oh, pop! I don't know. It's a queer feeling.

Next week. That quick, huh? I got no complaints. I don't mind doing an honest day's work if it leads to a dishonest dollar. Come on! Let's go eat. That's a good idea. Right back at it, eh, pop? Well, you can't teach an old dog new tricks. That's the way I've always played it, you know that. Hey, that food smells good, huh? [knocking] Hi, is Chino Sazarac here? Who wants to know? I do.

[Chino]: Why don't you guys stay here? It's going to take me a while to get used to the weather. Six years, man, I can't believe it. I'll show you where you're staying and Ellie'll fix you a beer and a sandwich. I'm rolling a joint. I don't care if you're rolling a drunk. Okay, this is it. It ain't much, but it's all you're gonna get. What are ya hangin' on to the old log for? Whadaya mean, "old log"? Log, man, that's a classic. They don't make 'em like that anymore. No more beer.

You know where it is. Find it yourself, just go. I think I will, before I drown in creeping nostalgia. And turn the music back on. I can't wait to get back to LA I can't wait. I really miss it, ya know. The only thing I miss about California is my kid. You were born there. It was never any big deal for you. I can remember when my mother split from the old man, and that she told me that she was gonna take me to California. You know, California! It's all gone. It's changed anyway, not what it used to be. Maybe for you, but not for me. You know what I miss most about California? Tacos and the chiliburgers. [Chino]: Of course, he's gonna do it, Will. Talked to him about it last night. He's happy as a puppy about it. That's right. Okay, meet me there. Meet us there about 1:00 and we'll get all the details ironed out, huh? Okay, go back to bed. [knocking] Surf's up. This is very pretty here... Very nice. Thank you. What are we doing here? I like to come down and count the seagulls. So, what are your plans? You're welcome to stay here as long as you want. I just wondered if you got some plans. No, I don't have any plans. You got plans? You and the two old buzzards? Me and Will an Coker are gonna rob the "Northern General Nickel Company" up in Coniston, Ontario. We need somebody to drive the car, equal split! You wanna do it? Are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious, it's nothin' we never did before. We never did that before! We dealt some dope. We dealt some big dope. No comparison. It's Will and Coker. It's Will and Coker. What a pleasant surprise. I already told 'em you were gonna do it. Why do you do that to me? I don't wanna hear it. Will ya listen to me. Coker's been working in the mine for three years [Chino]: He's got the whole place wired. He's got keys to everything. All we gotta do is walk in and take it. Listen, $200,000. I'm counting on you, man, understand? This thing's gotta work for me. Uh... Toby. Toby, Toby, yeah. If we keep movin', I think, you know, it won't be so cold. Chino fill ya in? Yeah, yeah. Well, any questions? Yup... How much do I get? $50,000. $50,000. Yup. Cheaper to call a taxi, wouldn't it? Look, son, I am not an amateur. I've done this kind of thing before. Well, if you're so good, how come you're not rich? Well, I figure you can't lose 'em all. You just want to cut me in for $50,000 'cause you're a nice guy. You're a friend of Chino's. You're not a nice guy, you're a saint, 'cause it's the first time being a friend of Chino's ever got me anything but trouble, and the more I think about it, the more I think it's not gonna change. Well one thing, I'm running this operation, not Chino. Chino tells me you've done time. Yeah, nothing big, dealing, you know. Stupid, got caught. I used to work on one of them old tugs, six years. [Coker]: Worst job I ever had. I'd like to think about it. Well, Chino... I thought he said you were in? How long you known Chino? Long enough. Uh, okay, well, look then. Ellie and Chino are comin' up next week sometime, so why don't you come along with them, and they have a tour of the whole stinkin' works, see, and that way, you can look around for yourself and then decide, okay? All right. I think it'll work out. I hope you come along. Well, here it is. I'm on the night shift this week so you keep the car. Do me a favour, will ya? Pick up, Ellie, take her to a movie or something. She's always bitchin' I never take her out. Hey, take your time. Don't rush it. Think about it, all right? Did you think about it? See you later.

Listen, Chino said that you haven't been gettin' out much lately, you might want to see a movie, so I thought I'd come down and... Volunteer, you've been ordered to volunteer, is that it? Oh, no, I can change the order. Wanna see a movie? What's playing? Well, there's one called "The Prime Mister Always Had a Good Time, No Matter What" Well, there's a real poor southern colloquial story. It's called, "I’m So Poor, I Can’t Afford To Pay Attention" [laughing] Yeah, okay, go ahead. [Chino]: Three fries, two hamburgers, everything on 'em, And a coffee. What do you do? Oh, I do bird calls. Good at bird calls. Yeah, wanna see one? I'd love to. Which one? Your favourite. My favourite is the Brazilian Mugwump. Wanna see him? [bird call] What's the matter?

Yeah, I feel a little better. [guide] What you see in front of you is our main converter aisle. It's 1,250 long. We have 19 of these units in the converter aisles. What they are used for primarily is to remove all of the iron that is left in the smelting process and to lower the sulphur down to about 22%. Now these units are charged with molten metal material that's around 2,100 to 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit, and it's blown with oxygen enriched air for a period of about half of the blowing cycle, which is about 18 hours.

Surfboard, yeah, I know that, but what was it really all about? I don't know. [television]: Minor damage. The driver escaped uninjured. Late this afternoon, three men attempted to rob a branch of the Toronto-Dominion bank in Scarborough. A film of the attempt, recorded by a camera concealed in the bank, shows that two armed men entered the premises at bank closing. A security guard, alerted by teller, Judy MacKenzie, was able to surprise the would-be robbers as they held bank officials at gunpoint. In the exchange of gunfire that followed, both gunmen were fatally wounded. Guard Frank Quin was unharmed. A third member of the gang... I don't think we need any more of that. It's better than going to prison. That's what you say. Oh yeah, you've been to prison, haven't ya? Well, you know, that's a drag, but you don't know what being dead is like, and that might be terrific. Ah, I think I'm going to get a beer. [telephone ringing] Hello. Pop, where are you? Pop... Pop, you want us to come over? Are you sure? Are you all right? Yeah, I know. Coker's dead! [minister]: "I am the resurrection, and the life," sayeth the Lord.
