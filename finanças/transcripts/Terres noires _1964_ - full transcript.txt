Les Films du Carrosse presents Black Earth 24.551 GTC Camera: Alavoine Assistants: Juros and Bataillon Text: Françoise Vatel Image: Bernard Davidson Direction: Luc Moullet Black earth is found in the four corners of France. Brittany, Massif central, Alps, Corsica, Pyrenees, Provence. Cars pass by, but they wouldn't venture there. Unlike the blacklands in Texas or the tchernoziom in Russia, this black earth is uncultivated, but it is inhabited. This village, Le Poil, has only one link with civilisation left: the post box, an hour below, where Léon Guichard is going. He is the postman, mayor, warden, and horse-dealer in Majastres, and in his satchel he carries all the food of the region. Here is the only spring, which provides 1 liter per hour to a decrepit town. Saint-Cyrice, with only one inhabitant. Sauveur Arthaud, the former mayor, had dead people vote and falsified the census, to embezzle funds. The new mayor lives in the only usable room of the town hall, the only building still standing. Here's the bar at the Point Sublime Hotel, at the Verdon Gorge. You may have visited this admirable site, but did you know that 2km above the torrent, you can take a narrow path to a rotten town of six souls? Taloire, which the prefect did not want to get rid of, because departmental funding depends on the number of towns. Buildings without roofs are exempt from tax, so when people left town, they took the tiles off. A ruin from the earthquake of 1951, even the church hardly got any compensation. It's true that it had no use anyway. In this land of religious refugees, the separation of Church and State in 1905 drove away the priests, the only ones capable of holding people to the land. Secularism and the proximity of the plain spurred on migrations. Nowadays, the young people have to go to boarding schools in the city, because the school was closed in 52, the same year they spent 300,000 francs to renovate it. The locals marked their time of departure on the table. The last year, there were only three students: 5, 9 and 14 years old. You can imagine how well that would work. It's shocking to observe such living conditions... in 1962 in metropolitan France, and yet Taloire is only one example among many. Life is infinitely more difficult in the village... where we are going: Mantet, Pyrénées-Orientales. From the station, it's over a four hour walk. Soon, the cliff road narrows, only 15cm wide here, where the camera tripod fell into the abyss. But we have to travel back... In the Middle Ages, nobody lived in the plain, menaced as it was by flooding and invasion. Far away on the mountain, there were paths and villages, but these wild gorges were the only way towards Mantet, faster and less risky than the high mountains. After 89, as the path through the gorge couldn't be widened, they had to open a wider route through this pass, although most of the traffic went through the valleys. That's why they started work on the Gorges Road, with their blasts of dynamite and their millions. But in 1935, on the 5th tunnel, the money ran out. 20 years later, this cheaper road was broken through the mountain, although it also remains dangerous and unfinished. The only-too-brief economic crisis of 1955... opened a window for its construction. They hired the unemployed, like during the crash of 29, to work on building the road. Unfortunately, the stock market recovered quite quickly. Thus, the road has become uneven and damaged, with gullies every three meters. Then, an abrupt stop at this garage-shack. Hunters there pile their dogs into the car. Next comes a small, unjeepable path, which the wife of the mayor, Mrs. Vidal, has to go up, at least until the next economic crisis... rain or shine. It was minus 3. The cameras and cameramen were shaking. An hour's march up to the pass, at 1765 meters altitude... 68 with the snow in winter. This time of year, you die before the doctor gets there. He takes 7000 francs for the 60km journey. The doctor from Vernet-les-Bains, less far away, refuses to come. 300 meters below, Mantet. The village is isolated on every side. Here, the Gorges; there, Spain. Many political refugees from both Spain and France, like General Delâtre in 1942, have crossed and continue to cross here, at this border that is too remote to be monitored, formerly made famous by the bootleggers of Mantet. 50 inhabitants, 1500 meters high, no road, no electricity, no shops, Mantet is an inextricable jumble of large houses on high. Outside, the manure is the only exterior sign of wealth. It serves as a main square and a street. You have to follow it from one house to another. Otherwise, you can lose your way in the dangerous maze of weeds, which conceal the holes in the roofs of abandoned cellars. Old bread ovens stick out of every house. This mailbox, has not been opened in 10 years. Here, is the end of the telephone cable. Stones along the walls and on top of the tiles, support the roofs with varying success. It's surprising to suddenly spot a sign of life, in this town that nevertheless contains more than 10 inhabited houses. These insurance ads seem quite ironic, as behind them, the wary frontier workers barricade their doors. Inside, it was too dark to film. The light from the butane gas did little for these rabbit huts, which are not far from the old-fashioned splendor of the Château d'Aubiry, with their sinister memory. Only 20km from the luxurious tourist stop Vernet-les-Bains, with its casino and its thermal baths, the animals are also kept under lock and key, or packed into pens. Not many domestic animals, nor poultry or rabbits. It's mainly livestock, sheep. There are three lambs, 69 ewes, 197 goats, 591 sheep. This Mantetian is carrying hay to his cows, because grass is rich enough for bovines. It would be naive to assume that because Spain is so close, you could compare Mantet to Las Hurdes, which is less fertile, but now has a standard of living that is higher than in Mantet. These nice big Swiss bastards don't much care for getting around on foot, so their owner has to stay in the countryside all winter. The only ones left are three old women in black, because the 25 Mantetians only have sheep, and go with them to the plain after Christmas. No laughter, no celebrations, no distractions at all here, right in the heart of the Roussilon, with its exuberant folklore. As the 15-year-old son of the mayor just left Mantet for good, this man is now the youngest person in the village. He's 40. Life in Mantet only knows one event, apart from plane crashes, the arrival of the mailman, twice per week. With his truck, he brings provisions up to the garage. It is replaced by a helicopter in winter, when 5-meter snowdrifts block the pass. This way of life has made the locals reserved, fearful and untrusting. As long as there is no road, and no students in the school, the ruins of which you see here, there will be no hope for Mantet. This was what we were told by Mr. Fillols, who runs the phone booth, in the back of his cabinet on the right. He was the only Mantetian who let us to film. I would like to thank him for this. Within 10 years, he said, Mantet will disappear from the map forever. Even today, it is hardly visible. Even more impoverished is Mariaud, in the Basses-Alpes. But it still has all its inhabitants. Go up the central valley, turn left, and there's Mariaud. You can reach it via the neighboring valley, like Mantet, and by its poor road, whose terminus is here, if the bus can make it that far. After the bridge, the black earth greets us. Here they call it "roubines," and year after year, it encroaches on the small makeshift path. The poor road mender always has a lot on his plate. After a half hour, the path is lost in the roubines. You move forward as you can, and suddenly, when you least expect it, Mariaud appears behind this small pass. Mariaud may seem close, but the donkey carrying our bags will have to go back down, because the hardest part is yet to come. In Provençal, "Mariaud" means: "crumbling mountain that is practically impossible for a human to climb." During the Occupation, no German risked climbing... all the way to this hotbed of resistance. After the lookout at Galèbre, it's the terrible final ascent. Here is the main street. At 1500 meters altitude, Mariaud has only 4 houses and 28 inhabitants, all related. But it does have a school, which you see here. Only 4 students, even though the girl on the right is already too old. She's just there for numbers, any fewer and the school would close. Her little brother, the boy of the left, would go to boarding school. In the afternoon, the students stay near the stove. Later, to see more clearly, they move closer to the window. Such youth is surprising in this place, more isolated and raw than Mantet, where emigration started from 1873, thanks to Mac Mahon and obligatory military service. Compared to the difficulties of country life, the city offered modern comforts and easy pleasures. From beautiful shop windows to Hollywood nonsense. In Mantet, the creation of a train jumpstarted emigration, which isolation had delayed until 1906. The war of 1914 completed the debacle. When the master of the house was killed, the whole family left. His wife, or he himself, if he was only made lame, would get a job in the city as a civil servant. This was what Mariaud lost, even though lower in the valley. Everyone took off. After 1920, a surprise: the highest hamlet in the commune... saw a rise in population, whereas below, it was deserted. Basically, the cantonal councillors sold off the towns for next to nothing, to the Water and Forestry commission, who reforested the roubines that were in danger of collapsing. But the reforestation was mainly done around the valleys. A unsympathetic approach meant the best pastures were reforested, sometimes against the wishes of the mayors. With nothing left for the animals to eat, the people left. The earth held steady, but nobody could live off it. The trees retained the water, which reduced the risk of flooding below, making cultivating the plains more attractive to the mountain-folk, living in these high thalwegs that reforestation dried out. Because of the great seepage of the water, they channel it through kilometers of plastic. Protected by their isolation, Mariaud and Mantet resisted. Only cables carry the weight. In the 30s, agriculture modernised in the plain, which cost too much. So they came back to Mariaud, a town with a comprehensive character: Provençal in its stairs and its climate, Savoyard in its roofs and high pastures. Here is Mr. Roux, mayor and postman. His wife. Another Mrs. Roux. Her son René. Her other son, one of the area's two soldiers, on leave from the djebels. Their father. Mr. Bayle, the schoolteacher. The third Mr. Roux isn't there. But here is his daughter, Mireille. This idle, pretentious Brigitte, still clings to her unattainable dream: to go and study German at the Sorbonne, and to snag a rich and handsome husband there. At first, the young Marialdians ran away from the camera, like Simone and Solange. According to them, city folk, who they wrongly consider superior, would make fun of how they dress and their way of life. We asked Jean-Pierre to photograph us. He didn't know the camera was rolling. We found him with Solange in the school, where they finally agreed to let us film them. After that, the Marialdians collaborated closely with us, and Mrs. Roux, who once ran from our camera, put on her nicest dress and asked us to film her with the radio. In 1957, the life of this land without electricity was turned upside down by the radio, which the donkeys listen to as they doze. In Mantet, where the radio is still unknown, the animals are sad, lifeless in their cages. But in Mariaud, they are full of life, and wander peacefully in the street, something you don't see anywhere else in France. The character of an animal always reflects that of its owner. To feed the town pig, they cultivate this field of potatoes, which these men work on with more ardor when the camera comes. In Mariaud, there are only six tiny fields and gardens, while in Mantet, there is a vast range of cultivation. Better no cultivation than poor cultivation, they say in Mariaud, where the fields are mainly used as pastures. The sheepskin isn't worth much, but the meat is excellent. In summer, the Marialdians have their flocks guarded by shepherds, strange, bizarre, schizoid people, but sometimes poetic, like the one who wrote this on a wall: Here I am in a sad state Before, I was hot but now I'm shivering The old lady just kicked me out. What to do? For sure, I'll catch cold. Signed: Man with no matches. Without his bananas or green peas, considered supreme luxuries of the city, the shepherd goes on strike. In Laragne, they just spent tens of millions, to build a psychiatric hospital, serving the entire country. Even though mental disorders are in decline. The church of Mariaud is no longer in use, and here is all that's left of the chapel. One fine day, the bishop of Digne came to Mariaud on a mule, a somewhat unstable vehicle that he had to abandon on the way back down, which took away any desire to come back. This man is not so fussy. Every Sunday morning, he goes with his donkeys to get the week's food. This bread can keep well for 15 days. It is kneaded for this purpose at a bakery in Prads. And in Digne, 30 km there, 30 km back. In winter, when there are 70 cm of snow, it's another story. The donkey blazes a trail several times per season, and it takes two hours to make it to the mayor's car, which takes the family to the fair in Digne, and its gigantic livestock market. The way back is even slower and more difficult. On the way, you can read "vote no," "vote yes," and "yes to De Gaulle." In fact, it was the day of the referendum. Our accomplice, Jean-Pierre, throws a snowball at Solange. Like this, she chases him into view of the camera. There are a lot of people. Claude Roux, on leave, traveled 500km to come vote. He arrived in the middle of the night with an empty ballot box, and soon he will go back down with a full one. Aimé Roux came back from the valley. Jules Roux voted. Everything is done as a family, with no voting booth. On the list, only three latecomers. The Marialdians don't seem to be worried or anxious about the result. The votes seems like a pretext for them to chat, with no connection to politics. At 13:30, four and a half hours before the official closing of the poll, the ballot box is full. The counting ceremony begins straight away. And that's it. Almost all the formalities are over. They don't even announce the results. Like everywhere else, it's a clear and massive "yes." Nine votes, nine yes. Right away, Mr. Bayle leaves for the valley, for his bi-weekly visit to Mrs. Bayle, which he delayed by a day in order to vote. The youth celebrate the event in their way. Joy reigns in the town, as the Marialdians are highly evolved people, able to be happy with what little they have. They know that their poverty is a kind of richness. The sheep don't need much investment, and as there are no shops, there's no temptation to spend. There is a kind of sorting. The least intelligent go down to the plain, or become functionaries in the city. The most capable go up to fill the empty spaces. Whereas below, the rooms are often dirty, poorly furnished, lacking any hygiene, here is the beautiful sideboard Mrs. Roux had brought up, with such difficulty! All is polished, all is clean. All is tidy. Hardly any manure, and on this manure, a luxury good: a bicycle, bought just for the joy of having one, because Massignan himself would never make it up this 40% slope. And that's not the worst. Any road would need to go through this gorge, far from the roubines. The cost: 36 million. "For this hole, why bother?" you say. But then, look at this town hall/ church/school, with a transformer... Why did they waste 3.6 million to build it in Trévans, which has only one home and two inhabitants? And in Mariaud, when the makeshift telephone line was cut by the rain, it was only repaired 11 days later. So far, despite the politician's promises, they've done all they can to make sure the black earth turns back into that beautiful desert so loved by aesthetes and novelists. From Taloire to Mantet, from Mantet to Mariaud, the harsher life is, the more man must struggle, and the happier he seems. But that's no reason to stop progress rushing forward. The living conditions here can't be improved enough, as they will always be quite harsh. And since the state imposes its way so heavy-handedly, it would do better to ensure a decent existence, for these people who have shown it their unanimous confidence. Roads and electricity must be installed the next year in Mariaud. Even if the problems of these minorities are less tragic, less pressing than those of the cities, where luxury causes far worse moral problems, even if it's the weakness of the State, that brings about the greatness of mankind and the nation. subs: smld/xxuuq at KG
