By accepting me, preserve my honour amongst our people. Sundari...

Don't fall off dozing my brother, O foolish brother Thinking letters of sugar (learning) as bitter Throwing off books like waste Thinking letters of sugar (learning) as bitter... Throwing off books like waste Keeping hands over heads... Keeping hands over heads... and blaming everything on fate... My grandpa, your grandpa and all our forefathers fell by dozing off. For a little soup, a piece of cloth, they placed their throats between the scissors of slavery. Wandered aimlessly while suffering Wandered aimlessly while suffering like living dead bodies. My grandpa, your grandpa and all our forefathers fell by dozing off. Open your eyes to face this life. Don't cower for threats and become a slave Open your eyes to face this life...

My brother, O foolish brother. Lakshmi. Anna (Elder brother)... come brother come. Come sit down brother. I have no time to sit down. Tell your son to take this letter and go to Mysore. I've told them everything. They'll definitely give a job. Anyway, it's good if you mother and son get settled in town and live happily. That's all we need. You'll have brought light to your sister's life. What's there in this cursed village? There's no proper shelter or means to survive. Who made us live like that? It's you, aren't you? Ramanna... no Cunningly hogging up all my mother's money, now you've come like a jackal? Do you see how your son's arrogance? Keep quiet mother. By tempting us with a job, you want to send us off from village? Come what may, we won't leave this village. Lakshmi, don't blame me anymore. Don't come seeking anything to my doorsteps. Hey Uncle, who'll come to your door? Even if we die starving, I won't send my mother to your door. Let's go mother. Amma, Shankaranna came. Aye Shankaranna... What my monkey? Are you doing well?... Amma, see how he calls me a monkey. No, no... It's Mangala. My brilliant little sister. Did you bring snow, powder and other things I asked for? They're not just for you. I've brought for your husband too. You're miffed if I talk about your husband? Shankaru.. Are you well?... Yes mother... How have you done in your exams? I've done okay. Will you pass?... Pass? Maybe... Is that corner field harvested yet? It's done. How much paddy did we get? It's done. But not one grain was brought home. Meaning? Don't you know your father's habits? He gave it all up by losing a bet against that Sahukara. Shankaru. Have you seen or heard anywhere losing grains over betting debts? Your father won't leave that until he brings us all to streets. He won't leave. Sahukara won't disregard your words. So, what do you want me to do? Put in a word for me. Please help me set right my life. Eh, tart. I know all your games. Sahukara has a lot of wealth. has a lot of money. By becoming his wife, you scheme to control everything, is it? Eh, go, go now... You whore. What did you call my sister? You have grown courage to raise hands against this Connection Kaalappa now? Why did you come begging him? Let's go brother. Let's ask the Sahukara. Appa (Father) When did you come back? Get up. Even after asking you to leave these cursed cards so many times, you won't listen to us, will you? Don't you have shame in life? You won't rest until you've given up everything to these people, do you? Shankara. If you give something to Sahukara... I'll kick you in the chest. If you hold these cards in your hands again... I'll kick you in the chest. What did you say son? You'll kick me in the chest? Come, come I say... Eh Shankara... Go. Look at him Sahukara. Son whom I gave birth to wants to kick me in the chest. [Laughing] Mylari... You're father to him... Or he's father to you? I have doubts now. Hey kid, he comes here for about half hour to relieve his boredom. Is that wrong? Yes, you people play to pass time and my father plays to lose everything. Eh, get up father... Leave me be.. My wealth should all go to Sahukara... or... Sahukara's wealth should all come to me. Until then... I'll keep playing this game with Sahukara... I have determined like that. That is how a determined speaks... How weak hearted your son is... Eh Shankara... You've grown so arrogant as to spit in front of me? I'm letting you go because you're Mylari's son. If it was someone else... I'd have got their tongues split. Sahukara, don't let him go because he's my son. If he ever turns against you, he's no more my son. Sahukara. Why do you come? Sahukara, what about my sister? Why do you ask me? How can you say like that? The child in her womb... isn't it yours? Who said so? If a village has a street, everyone walks on it... I could've walked it like everyone.. If you accuse that all the footsteps belongs to one, how can that be? Will anyone agree? They'll beat you up... Go go. Sahukara. People like us shouldn't live in this wretched world, akka. We'll jump into a lake or well. Eh Maacha. Why do you jump into a well? If you want to die, die hanging yourselves in front of that Sahukara's house. Who's it wanting to die all over again? Ramanna, come. Come here. What's it Shankara? What's all this? These people are going off to die. O, you people think you're still alive? Only two people live in this village. One is that Sahukara.. Another one...[pointing to Connection Kaalappa there] Everyone else is just breathing dead bodies. Ramanna... Sahukara did this to my sister... I know.. My mother... born after him... when he can cheat her, who else will matter to him? You want to die huh? Let's go. If I sit closing my eyes... I can see only you, O Shiva... I can see only you If I sit closing my eyes... I can see only you, O Shiva... I can see only you When I open my eyes and see... I see hundred more like you, O Shiva... I placed you first in all my offerings... I saw hundreds of hungry stomachs in that plate of offering... When will those stomachs see plates filled with rice...O Shiva... plates filled with rice... You wear all the nice clothes offered to you... In those clothes I saw poor wearing torn pieces of clothes. When will those bodies see nice clothes...O Shiva... nice clothes... You sit quietly in your temple... You've forgotten those who don't have a roof... When will those godlike people have their warm shelter...O Shiva... their warm shelter... If I sit closing my eyes... I can see only you, O Shiva... I can see only you When I open my eyes and see... I see hundred more like you, O Shiva... Come.. Come... Let Shiva bless everyone... Shankara, how's your studies going on? With your grace everything's fine. Ramanna Why is it you all have come here together? What's the matter? Why are you so dull? Tell me what is it? Sundaravva. Why are there tears in your eyes? What happened? In a village where good people like you reside... we are doubtful whether Dharma exists or not... Dharma holds more value or a wealthy man holds more value, we can't understand... People who believe in justice and morals... are worse than a dog, Buddhi (guru)? In our village... Who did injustice to you? Tell me... I shall ask... Buddhi, in our village... He who believes village is only him and ... he's the village... our Sahukara, goes about blowing his own trumpet... Kaalappa, I heard, yesterday, Mylari's son Shankara came to your house? said, 'Sahukara's like this, like that, we should break his teeth...'? he lectured you saying all that? and you were all nodding in agreement? Is that true? Who has the courage to talk ill of god like you and still live? Which rascal told you that? Oye, I told him. Am I a rascal? What you say Shankarappa said is right... You only listened to his part... Do you know what happened after that? I've scolded him such that he wouldn't dare talk about you again. Sahukara, Swamiji (guru) sent for you. You are to come immediately. Is it so? Tell him I'm on my way. Look here. If I hear anything of this sort again... those who talk, those who hear, both will be taken care of. Go Go. Sahukara Didn't you say you needed planks for your attic floor? Cut down this tree.. It will make more planks than needed. What are you talking Kaalappa? Does anyone cut down a tree in front of monastery? Doesn't it give shade to all those who visit? Eh. Shut up. You son of a slave. What's the connection between a tree and monastery? Is this tree more valuable to you than our Sahukara's house? Kaalappa... You're my loyal friend. But this slave doesn't have that loyalty. Give me that coconut. [Taking Shiva's different names] Eh, sit down. Sit down. Eh Sundarakka, why are you standing? Sit down. Eh, sit down I say. When some big man like our Sahukara comes... you shouldn't stand. You should sit. That's the respect he deserves. Shiva... Buddhi Sahukara has come. Guru, I fall at your feet. How are you? It's all your grace. You sent for me? I've come. Yes, Sahukara. I wanted to talk something important with you. That's why I sent for you. Did I cause any trouble? Shiva, Shiva. Trouble? How is it a trouble to come to our own monastery? Shiva, Shiva. Sahukara. You're a big man in this village. living with Dharma and justice... you should be setting example for others. When you walk the wrong path... how can we advise others? Buddhi.. what you're talking... and why you have called our Sahukara... can't seem to understand what the connection is. Sundaravva. Sahukara. I've come to know about the relations you had with Sundaravva. It's your duty to keep the promise you gave her. That is Dharma. Did you see Kaalappa? These rascals, joining together, have created such a drama here? We are not the rascals. You've done what's worthy of a rascal. Call yourself that. What's this? You made me a loafer in front of Buddhi? Buddhi. This woman and I... I swear on you, your holy feet... I swear on Shiva, there's no relation. Yes Buddhi, there's no connection at all. Buddhi.. Listening to these beggars... listening to these rascals... listening to this whore... Sahukara Sahukara? This is a holy place. Mind your tongue when you're talking. See... you keep the promise you gave this woman, that's when you'll have your honour. In my private matters... if you don't get involved... you'll keep your honour too. If you understand that you were placed in this holy place by us and others... you'll have long life. come Kaalappa. Sahukara... Kariya... If you two ever touch Sahukara... he'll call me... Kariya... beat these two, he'll say... I'm in his debt... I can't say no. I'll beat you two definitely. One strike... and you'll be dead... Don't... don't do it my brothers... Maacha, please take this Kencha with you... Don't have anything to do with him.. Go... Go brother... Go... Eh go now... Sahukara will marry me... Sahukara will definitely marry me... he won't cheat me.. he won't cheat me... Akka. Sahukara will marry me. definitely he'll marry me. you bring all the jewels and prepare for marriage. He'll marry me... Hey, there's marriage between the Sahukara and me. You all must come. Sahukar and I are getting married... Sahukara and I are getting married. You all must come. Sahukara and I are getting married. You all must come. Leave me... Akka... Leave me... Sahukara is calling me, let me go... Anna (elder brother) Our akka has gone mad... mad... Ramanna. Finally Sahukara... took Sundarakka's life... with a disdain for Dharma... sinner isn't he? We shouldn't let him go on like this. Not him... We should first destroy his fiefdom Why did you come to this wretched man's house? Why? Son... there was nothing left in the house. Instead of losing shame by asking others... whatever may be, he's my brother born of the same blood. Thinking if at all I lose shame, let me lose it here, I came and asked. He's given me two measures of rice. If you had begged in the streets.. I won't have considered it shame. One who cheated you of your property... your brother's colour... can't you still see? Throw that.. throw. Leave it... Leave it... This is not rice for us.. poison, poison. How old are you now? My golden girl, our village beauty. My age is now to rock the cradle, my dear, our village hero. How old are you now? My golden girl, our village beauty. My age is now to rock the cradle, my dear, our village hero. Even though many from all over asked for my hand, I have strong desire for your hand in marriage. day or night, it's your name I keep thinking of. This love of yours has joined in me and charmed me. How old are you now? My golden girl, our village beauty. My age is now to rock the cradle, my dear, our village hero. At this time of harvest, greenery blooms, it's your warm breath that fills everywhere. For a heart filled with dreams, desires are numerous. You trouble me wherever I go, you are my sugar and milk. How old are you now? My golden girl, our village beauty. My age is now to rock the cradle, my dear, our village hero. All your mischief, a thing of enjoyment and I feel elated when I see you. At an age full of spirits, heart desires our marriage. Acting like you disagree, you come running to wed me. You're my peacock. How old are you now? My golden girl, our village beauty. My age is now to rock the cradle, my dear, our village hero. How old are you now? No, no. I won't tell. How old are you now? I don't know. Leave me. I'll keep driving Sahukara's cart. I suddenly remember you. As if you came, danced in my heart... where would be my senses or the cart... where would I be?... Eh, Kariya. Put my daughter down... Kariya. Stop there. Stop. What man? You try to flirt with my daughter? Is it any wrong to talk to the girl I'd marry? Marriage? What did you say? Chennavva, come here. My daughter whose colour is like a bright palm flower... how do I give her hand to you who looks like a ripe banana leaf? Uncle Palm flower... when it dries, it's just like ripe banana leaves. Eh... Yes father. You keep quiet. You don't know anything. Kariya. If you want to marry my daughter... one condition. What is it? You bring a gold coin necklace for my daughter... we'll talk about the marriage then. What sort of condition is this? gold coin necklace? How can I get it? Me... Just a slave of that Sahukara... A nobody who's surviving as slave labour... has no father or mother... I'm an orphan. Where will I get it? A gold coin necklace? I get so angry over her father... makes me strike him a blow... This wretched hand. If I put this hand over him, he'll be dead, Shankarappa. That's why I'm quiet fearing that. I don't know what to do. Kariya, do one thing. What do I do? Do you know what Arjuna did in Mahabharata? How would I know what he did? He loved Subhadra. He eloped with her. In the same way, you too elope with her. What are you talking Shankarappa? Just because he eloped, should I follow him? Will our villagers let me live? Will I have any honour? You seem to think I'm like my Sahukara. Kariya. Your Sahukara doesn't have morals as much as you. He made Sundarakka go crazy. I don't have anything to do with elder's business. I want my Chenni to come and a gold coin necklace. Tell me what to do for that. Hmm. Come. Sahukara. What is it Kariya? There's nothing... I... I... One girl... Did you rape her? Shiva, shiva. What sort of things do you speak? It's not that. I... am loving a girl. Have decided to marry her. You illiterate fool. You have been with me these many years.. Didn't you understand this much? Meaning? Hey, you should love girls... but shouldn't marry them. Hey Kariya. Would anyone wash and take home the banana leaf they eat on at village feasts? Eat off it, throw it and go your way. What are you talking? The Chenni I love is silver plate. She's not the leaf one throws away after one's eaten. What do you want from me now? Nothing. The girl's father says.. the marriage will happen only when I give a gold coin necklace. If not he said he wouldn't give her hand in marriage. Sahukara, please get a gold coin necklace done for me. I'll marry my Chenni. Yes yes. Your father has left me with a fortune... to make a gold necklace for your marriage. Get lost. But... But I was told my money is with you. Which fool told you so? That Shankarappa told me so. What did he say? Tell me what he said. He said... "For 20 years, you've been doing labour for your Sahukara..." "except food twice a day..." "has he given you any wage," "that mongrel who calls himself your boss?" "Haven't you toiled?" He said, "Slap him on his face and ask for a gold coin necklace" I haven't asked for a penny for these 20 years, how can I ask for a gold necklace suddenly? I said. "Why do you fear so much," "you scared son of a coward," "is there dearth of money with that despicable man?" "When he dies, would he take all the money with him?" he said many such things. So I said to him... Hey Shankarappa... don't talk ill of my master in front of me. It won't be good for you. I've told him like that. Sahukara. Please get a gold coin necklace and let this marriage happen. My wife and I, till we die... will be slaves to you for our life. No gold necklace.. not even a damn penny. Get lost, you scoundrel. Sahukara You had Tavarekere Thimmi in your farm house... you gave her 500 rupees. To Rangamma of Rampura... for only one night... you gave her 1000 rupees. For 20 years I've been slaving under you... this orphan... is worth less than them? You fool. The enjoyment you get with one bottle of brandy... would a big vessel of water give you that? Brandy's worth is different, a vessel of water's worth is different. Don't talk nonsense now and go do your job. Sahukara. I've promised Chenni that I'll marry her. Is it Dharma to forget those promises given to a trusting girl? Is it justice, Sahukara? Go throw your Dharma and justice in dump. Sahukara. You may have deceived Sundarakka... promised her and spoilt her life... and threw justice and Dharma in the dump. But I can't do so. I can't do so. Sahukara. I want gold necklace. I want gold coin necklace. Give me money. Give me money... Give me money. You thankless bastard. You bring up Sundari's matter and taunt me? [Cursing] You slave dog... Sahukara. Only one strike with this hand... and you won't survive. Just because you've given me food... I'm going quietly. Hey Rudra. Go bring that town crier. Hey what happened? What happened? Didn't Sahukara give you money for the necklace? What are you talking? He gave. He gave a handful. See here. Oh my god. They've beaten my dear like cattle. Shankarappa. What is it Chenni? Sahukara has beaten Kariya like cattle. He's lying at the well crying. Hey Kariya. What happened? Tell us what happened. Shankarappa, I listened to you and asked Sahukara for necklace. He's given me, see. Long necklaces on my back. You keep saying that your one strike will take life of a man. Couldn't you've struck him then and there? You coward. You aren't as much brave as her. You fat idiot. When he was beating you, were you holding butter in your hands? What are you people talking? Sundarakka. Kariya. Did Sahukara give you gold necklace? Let me see them. Our Sahukara... gave Kariya a gold necklace. Our Sahukara gave gold necklace to Kariya. Siddappa, Sahukar has given gold necklace to Kariya. Hear ye, hear ye. All the villagers hear. Our Sahukara's slave Kariya has disrespected and hit our Sahukara. To Kariya, in this village... no one is to give any food or water. So orders our Sahukara. Those who violate this... will be banished from the village. Why are you taking my drum? Hey kariya, come here. Leave my drum, I'll tell Sahukara. Kaalappa. Seems like these beggars have come begging. Shall we give them anything? Sahukara. Without calling village council, without investigating... To our Kariya, in this village... no one is to give food or water... Who gave you the right to have it announced like that in the village? Why would anyone give him that right? He is Paduvaarahalli. Paduvaarahalli is him. Village council is him and he is the village council. For this Paduvaarahalli... whatever he says is justice. whatever he says is law. You son of a slave. Bringing all these useless scoundrels, you challenge me? Uncle, wherever there's injustice, we will challenge it. Kaalappa. Ha? These kids... are saying they'll challenge me. Who's behind our Sahukara... what all kind of people are behind him... where are they all... How they are, you have any idea? Came here beating that good for nothing drum... beating to, to, to We have a very big drum. If we beat that drum once, it'll be like typhoon. In that, dry leaves like you will be thrown far off. You beat whatever big drum you want to beat. We'll keep on beating our drum. Mangala, mangala. What is it brother? Bring some water Today Kariya will eat at our home. Go tell mother. Amma, amma. Appa (father) From today, Kariya will stay with us, will be with me. Hey, first send him off from here. He'll feed him food? Appa, I won't send him back. If you won't, I will. Hey get lost... Appa. Shankara. If Sahukara marks a line here... and says not to cross it, the village doesn't dare to cross it. Yes, Sahukara... says leave all your women and children, will you leave them? We'll do so. Do you think there're only sheep in this village to obey whatever your Sahukara says? Keep seeing. The whole village should turn against him. I'll make it happen. Let's go Kariya. Everybody stop. Stop working in the fields. Stop it. See here. See what your Sahukara has to Kariya. Today he beats Kariya... tomorrow he'll beat you. workers are like... rotten grains he thinks. If his arrogance has to be broken, nobody should work for him. Till he apologises for beating Kariya... no one among you should go to work in house or fields. He should understand the value of people who sweat for him. Come out everybody, no one shall work. Leave me. Until there are people like this, your fate or the village's fate won't change. Shankara.. Go. Shankara, shankara. Shankara. Are you leaving us brother? Why should you leave for this? Is this even a village? Those who want to live with freedom... mustn't live in this village. No one must live... Shankara Go inside. Go. Shankarappa, Shankarappa. Don't leave because of me. Even if the village leaves me, Swamiji in the monastery won't. I'll somehow slave in the monastery and survive. Don't leave because of me. Hey Kariya, I'm not leaving because of you. People like us must not live in this damned village. Is it so? Go go. Shankara, you're the one to say that you'll break his arrogance. Now you're the one leaving fearing him. Is it right? Who's leaving fearing him? I fear if I live with these cowards, I too will become one.That's why I'm leaving. Go. Hey Shankaranna, I thought you were strong like Arjuna. You're running away like Uttarakumara. Go go those of us who are stuck in that vulture's mouth You're going even after seeing them? Go Go. The whole village is stuck. What can I do? What? I can't do anything. Shankarappa. Where're you going? I'm leaving this village. Then... You won't come back? No. I won't come back even if I die. This Sundari was born here and will die here. Shankarappa. When I die won't you come to see me off? Sundarakka. Go go. Go burn your house because it's filled with waste. Cut off your limbs because they're muddy. Because village has become dirty, you leave it. Go. Hey Go. This mother earth who gave me birth. How can I leave her? This soil which gave me rice. How can I forget it? This mother earth who gave me birth. How can I leave her? This air, this water are my body, This street, this house are my cradle. This air, this water are my body, This street, this house are my cradle. This Maacha and Kencha, all these names, Are evergreen in my heart. This mother earth who gave me birth. How can I leave her? I drank the milk of this Gange and Gouri, I enjoyed running around and danced happily in the village. I drank the milk of this Gange and Gouri, I enjoyed running around and danced happily in the village. Kaalavva and Subbavva raised me, How can I forget these mothers who've blessed me? This mother earth who gave me birth. How can I leave her? This life, this body spending all of it, knowing that new desire, new path is a dream. This life, this body spending all of it knowing that new desire, new path is a dream. Looking perplexed at the sky and ground below.... those caged birds, how can I forget them? This mother earth who gave me birth. How can I leave her? This soil which gave me rice. How can I forget it? Ramanna. What's all this? Embracing each other... hands on each other's shoulders... Thu [Spits] Shankara. Are flour and ash the same? Shouldn't there be any difference? There should be. That difference... was not there till now. That's why these villagers... were fed opium [metaphorically] and you... and your Sahukara only you two were awake. You married because whatever you did became the law It'll all stop from now. Kaalappa Uncle. Go tell your Kauraweshwara in this Paduvaarahalli, Pandavas are born and that he be careful about it. Let's go. We shouldn't have rushed. We shouldn't have had them turn against us. See. 4 people became 5. All five together... to us... Don't be silly. I hold the whole village in this hand like this. What can those scoundrels do to me? That's why... I say that your brain doesn't work sometimes. Today five. Tomorrow it's fifty. Day after it'll be 5 hundred. So? So... Let's cunningly bring them to our side. What do you propose to do for that? What do you have to do to bring people on the other side to yours? Back in ancient times... in Ekachakra nagara... all the rice brought home by Pandavas from begging... Kuntidevi had them sit down and... she used to feed them. seeing you I remembered that. What's this Kaalappa uncle? You come like lightning in the middle of summer? I came just like that. When moustache itself starts eating the nose, what do you do? Moustache eating nose? How's this connection? There is...There is.. Now who are you all? Your are all closely connected to our Sahukara, aren't you? Now you? Our Sahukara's nephew. Our Kariya? A worker who worked 20 years for Sahukara and was like son to him. Our Shankara? Our Mylari,a close friend of Sahukara, his son. Yesterday night he sat down with me... I explained him in detail how we're all connected. In Sahukara's eyes, tears started flowing profusely. Like this? Kaalappa uncle? Hasn't it stopped yet? No I swear on you. Kariya. I don't know what he thought... Sahukara got up suddenly.. opening the safe like that... handing me the money like so... Kaalappa go. Give Kariya a thousand... Let him get a gold necklace done. and he said "let him marry Chenni." Take it, take it. Is it so? Ok ok. For us? for us? I'll get you what you want. Ask whatever you want. I'll get them. Kaalappa uncle, come here. It's worthless. You took my hat? Hey that coat is torn, I'll get a new one. Hey what's all that? Connection Kaalappa is gone, alas. [group singing] Sahukara, did you see? These loafers... made me a dead body while I'm alive. Screamed and cried all over the village that I'm dead. Kaalappa. This is not your insult but mine. My insult. You sons of bitches. You've put your hands in snake's burrow. Be careful. Sahukara. You've thrown stone at beehive. You be careful. Sahukara. You made my sister go crazy easily. You can't make us go crazy like that. Uncle. You ruined your sister's life without effort. You can't ruin ours. Sahukara. To your money... We're not slaves to your money. Keep that in mind. Sahukara, Sahukara. Money, money, pick them up. Akka. Tomorrow is village deity's festival Get up. Get up. Go take a bath. We'll take you too. We'll see if that cures you. Tomorrow. Festival. Tomorrow our mother's [village deity] festival Sundari. Tomorrow is village deity's festival. You know right? I know Sahukara. Before that. I thought of visiting my goddess. No. Go back. I want to talk with you, come. Didn't I say no? You won't come? Leave me Sahukara. Hey Sundari. Don't call me Sahukara [master]. I'm your slave. You're saying the same thing for one year now. What if something goes wrong? Let this festival pass. I'll marry you. I'll make you my queen. really? I swear on village goddess. Festival came. Mother goddess will come. I'll ask her. Why did Sahukara leave me? Why did he hit me with a whip? Is it wrong that Sundari loved Sahukara? Is it wrong? I'll ask mother goddess. Festival came. Mother will come. Festival is here. Mother will come. Festival is here. Mother will come. I'll ask her. Festival is here. Mother will come. Sahukara, Sahukara. They had come to home asking for you. Procession has to start. People are waiting for you. Then why did you come here? Let them wait. Procession can start anytime. My Nanji has come after a long time. Hey go. If somebody asks for him, tell them you don't know. Go. Nanji, people will wait... but will you wait? What's this Kaalappa? This procession should've started this morning. It's noon and it's still not started. What's the meaning of this? What do you mean? Sahukara should come, offer his prayers and then it starts. All this people are standing quietly Why're you whining? Kaalappa uncle, people aren't quiet because of their devotion. They're quiet because they don't have the courage to ask you. How long should the people wait? How long do the children stay hungry? Is your Sahukara bigger than god? He must come on time and start the procession. Be quiet. Sahukara is not in his home. He must've gone on some urgent business. Wait quietly till he comes or leave. The procession won't start till he comes. Nanji, this farmhouse I built is useful only today. Ramanna, Ramanna. Sahukara In his farmhouse... don't you know Nanjasaani? He's flirting with her. Will you all wait in this sun till he comes? Or start this procession? Let's start the procession ourselves. Sahukara should come. It can't start before he comes. Stop. Move aside. Stop it. Stop it. Hey stop. Take it back to where it was. The goddess can't move till I say so. Our mother goddess is not your slave. She's the one who created me and you. She's going forward and won't step back. If you want, you come behind this. Sahukara, Sahukara. Kaalappa, Mylarappa. Are you satisfied with the insult to me? What are you still looking at? Bora, Thimma, crush these scoundrels. Hey Rudra. Go to Chennapura Police station bring the police telling I sent for them. Leave my brother, leave. Let's go home... Leave me mother. Ramanna, if you crack his head, will they let you go quietly? Don't. Let's go. Leave me mother. Hey, 50 people fall on us 5? Come on, whoever is left. Hey you slaves of that Sahukara, come. Come, come. How many are you? Come. Officer, you've known how good I am. Kick and take these goons. They're spoiling the village. Please let him go... Shankara, Shankara. I have not stolen the gold necklace. I don't know what happened to it. I swear I don't know what happened to it. I have not stolen the gold necklace. Stop, stop. Slowdown. Sahukara, these boys have done it without thinking. Don't take them to police and court. Let's settle this ourselves. settle this? amongst ourselves? It should be decided in court. These rascals must see the jail. They brought danger to mother goddess' community. They've stolen the goddess' necklace. When asked why they did so, they beat everyone up. If these people are let go, tomorrow the whole village will be spoilt. Take them officer. Let him go. Take them, take them. These are the ones spoiling the village. They're the thiefs, they're the liars. These are the ones who scare the village... and the ones who do injustice. Don't let these people go, police, don't... Drag them away, drag them away. What would happen to those who turn against me, let this whole village know. The war goes on even after thousands of years, the war between good and evil men The war goes on even after thousands of years, the war between good and evil men Hiranyakashipu pestered boy Prahlada, but he died at the end. Hiranyakashipu pestered boy Prahlada, but he died at the end. When Narahari came exploding from within the pillar, Dharma won that day. the war goes on. the war between good and evil men Ravana having ten heads succumbed to Srirama's arrow. Ravana having ten heads succumbed to Srirama's arrow. Mountain of pride fell that day, Dharma won that day. The war goes on. the war between good and evil men. The war goes on even after thousands of years, the war between good and evil men the war goes on. the war between good and evil men You played all kinds of games in life. But you left one out. What game is that? Betting on horse... Hey that's not a big deal. We'll play that one too. But when you're going take me with you. Kaalappa. Those beggar Pandavas have only been sentenced to three months of jail. Couldn't something have been done to send them away for three years? Those who judge aren't loyal to duty. A Sahukara like you helps a village prosper... saves the poor... brings the country forward. You're the village and village is you. Even after explaining all this, they [judges] didn't listen Let it be. When they come back with their broken backs after three months, they won't wag their tail in front of you for another 30 years. You mean I live only for 30 years more? Still 30 more... We can rule however we want. Why would I need all that? There's my son to look after. all my business. Hey Chenni On the path Sahukara walks, you stand blocking it? Like a repo man? Give him the way. In our village... there's one way for Sahukara, and another for poor... I know it very well, Shakuni [derogatory] uncle Shakuni uncle? Hey, where are your senses? When the necklace was stolen during festival, I thought of sending you too with Kariya.. I've let you go because you're our village girl, do you know? My Kariya, what injustice had he done to you? You sent him to jail. Since he was born... he worked in your house. he served only you. My Kariya used to eat so much, so much for one meal. In jail, only this much... they say they serve only this much. My Kariya is dying without enough food. I beg you, please get Kariya released. Do you see Kaalappa? How she's crying? That is... the connection between her and that Kariya. It makes her cry like that. What if we cut that connection? All the current is gone... Shakuni Uncle. There's no one born of this soil who can separate us. My Bhima who's in jail will come back. My Bhima who would break the thighs of this Duryodhana will come back. Your Bhima will come? He'll break my thighs? Before that comes our Dusshasana. Rudra. Show her Dusshasana's valour. Leave me. Leave me, let me go. Sahukara. Shall we see how the bird is? Sahukara. Kaalappa. Why did this Jangama [Itinerant] come here? Jangama... What's the connection between you and this place? Why did you come here? Chennavva. Wear that cloth and come out. You don't have to fear anything till I'm here, my mother. Sahukara. Do you see? Charity of cloth. Charity of cloth. Lord Krishna appearing himself, appearing himself. I may not be Krishna, Sahukara. But you're behaving just like Kauravas. Hey jangamayya. Don't make connections between our Sahukara and mythology. Buddhi. Get up, rise my mother. Sahukara. This is where the connection is. Between Saffron and sexual desires. Even if Jangamayya wears saffron on his body, can you make those sexual desires that sit within wear the saffron ? Sahukara. You made fun of the one who wears the saffron. Do you make fun of the hand that holds the sickle too? Sundari's honour, you snatched it. Now? You snatched Chenni's saree too? Even if Sundari is dishonoured, I'll let go. Give back Chenni's saree. You mad dog. Won't you give? Sahukara, we don't want any connections with crazy people. Didn't I give him 500 and got signed for 1000? And that corner house Maada... We should take his 2 acre field into possession today. You're right. Then if they dare to wag their tail before us, will we let him go? Anna. Anna Anna Anna What injustice have I done to you that you sent my son to jail. I fall at your feet. Get him released, get him released. Lakshamma. Once the court has given the judgement, it can't be undone. Let him stay for three months. See... lesson that you learn in jail, you won't when outside. Lakshmi. Tell your son to behave at least after returning from jail. If he turn against me, or support an opposition, I'll have his limbs broken and tied to a pole. I'll throw bread little by little at him all his life. Anna, just because I couldn't bear the grief and came to you, don't talk as you please. To have his limbs broken and tied to a pole by you and to open his mouth for your bread crumbs, I've not given birth to a bangle wearing girl. I've given birth to a man who wears a moustache like you. Remember that. Sahukara? Ah forget it. Kaalappa, for some reason I keep remembering my son today. Appaji[father] Appa. Appa. What's this son? You come suddenly. I come suddenly, go suddenly. Is it anything new to you? Who's that? Hi Myna, get off please, come in. [In hindi] Get down from the vehicle Welcome home. Myna, meet my daddy. Namaste. Shiva, Shiva.. Come inside. Wow. How do you like the house? Fantastic, it's very nice. This is 300 years old. uh huh? Appaji come here. Come come. Come. Mr.Mari, your father looks very young. What's this son? She's calling me a peon? Appa, In hindi, Jawan means youthful boy. She says you look like a young boy. Is it so? Shiva, Shiva. Say that again, say that again. This? He's my father's close friend. And his name is Kaalappa. Oh, Namaste. What did you say his name was? Kallappa? Ayyayyappa [Oh god]. Ayyayyappa? no, no. His name is Kaalappa. Kaalappa? yeah, lappa,lappa [mockingly] My name is Mylarappa. Mylarappa? yeah, rappa,rappa [mockingly] He's right hand and I'm the left hand to our Sahukara. Meaning? Meaning he's my father's right hand and he's the left hand. Oh, I see. That's alright son. Who's this and why has she come? Appaji, she's from Delhi. Oh, this is Delhi connection. Sahukara. Our Marigowda has connections in Delhi too. Isn't he my son? Appa, her name is Myna Choudhary Her father is a big man in Delhi. Oh like our Sahukara is to this village, you mean? That's ok son. Why did you bring this Delhi here? We've come planning something big. Plan... Plan. What's that plan? Mr.Mari, I'm tired, Let's go take some rest. Sure, sure. Appaji, we're very tired after travelling. Let's talk about this plan later. First make arrangements for her. Let her take some rest. Appa, In our country, to setup big factories even in small villages, government is ready to give millions of rupees. Sahukarji? Mynaji? [In hindi] All of us together will open a factory in your village. A big factory. What is Mynaji saying? She says let us all open a big factory in this village. Mr.Mari, you haven't told your father about our factory plans? Tell him. She's talking about paddy? She means show it. oh, in hindi, batta means to show? yes. Appaji, this is our factory plan. Look at this. This labours' colony. labours' colony. What does it mean? It means that's where the labourers stay. Why do the labourers need house? Appa, those are factory rules. Is it so? Yes. Look at this. This is the plan of the house we stay. Ah, this is required. This is most required. What do you say Kaalappa? Don't we? Sahukarji. Mynaji? Listen, to open a factory in your village my father would get 2 million from the government. Appaji... Her father is ready to get 2million from the government to build a factory here. 2 million? Then do it. But before that, if we give 2 lakhs to her father, he'll deposit it with the govt. and get 2 million sanctioned. How will I have 2 lakhs? Don't give it from your pocket. If you introduce us to people in all the surrounding villages, that's enough. Ah, I know, I know. If you introduce them to people in all surrounding villages, they'll get hold of everybody from big fish to small fish. You give thousand, they'll take it. give 500, they'll take it. give 100, they'll take it, give 5, they'll take it and give 50 paise, they'll take that too. They'll keep taking like this and make their 2 lakhs. Go to Delhi, and bring 2 million. Is it not, Marigowda? Correct,correct. Ok, let's do as you say. Myna, Myna, daddy has agreed, he'll help us. Is it? Thanks many many thanks. Is she saying she'll start on Friday? Appaji. Namaste Ji. Son. What's this new dress? This lady was shining like queen sitting on throne yesterday. But today she looks like she's going to forest like Sita. That's why, I say that sometimes you don't have brain. Their dress and the job they're going on are both strongly connected. How are they both connected? If a swami doesn't wear saffron cloth, would you prostrate before them? If the police don't wear the khaki, would you fear them? Likewise, in this age, if you want to do something, become something, The way you talk, the way you dress are important. Is it? I got it now. Appaji, shall we go? Yes, let's go. Come. In collecting these 2 lakhs, you people helped us very much. Thank you very much for that. I haven't seen good people like you in any other village. She says she hasn't seen good people like in any other village. God is not up there. He's here in the form of Sahukarji. Appaji, she says god is not up there, he's in your form. Now, Mr.Mari and I are going to Delhi and I promise, that I'll come back soon and help you realise your dreams. All of us together will definitely build a factory here. Namaste, namaste. Son, write me a letter about everything from Delhi. Yes father. I'll also go to Delhi. Hey get down. One must sing the song once. that says everyone is equal. One must sing the song once. When worker is broken, and life is grief striken When worker is broken and life is grief striken where is high or low class? A song that says everyone is equal. One must sing the song once. Unity is the only mantra, Liberty is possible only with unity. Yes Unity is the only mantra Yes Maacha Liberty is possible only with unity. Let's break the ignorance. A song that says everyone is equal One must sing the song once. 14 worlds 7 seas Kencha 14 worlds and 7 seas We have strength within to conquer them. A song that says everyone is equal One must sing the song once. Oh no. Bad luck. Mari, mari come here. See there, a group of people are coming. Let's take their help. Them? They're my father's enemies. Didn't appa say they were in jail? these are the people. They're all jail birds? We're only two. be careful with the suitcase. Aren't you Sahukara's son Mari? When did you get married? No she's my friend from Delhi. Hey, how's your father? He'll be fine. what's there to bother him. See The wheel is stuck in the mud, will please help us by pushing the car? Oh, we've decided not to help Sahukara or his family with anything. Come let's go. Just because his father is a wicked man, we need not be so to him. Come come. Push it. Push it. Push it with all your stength. Hey what's that? Wearing a suit and boots and standing there, you're ordering us to push? Lad, do you think we're slaves? It's your car, come push it. Hey what's this? He's left his box. Hey stop the car. Hey Kariya Let's give it to his father. Chenni. Mangalavva, Mangalavva. Mangalakka, they've all come back from jail. Is it? Amma, amma Shankaranna has come back. Our Shankara is back. Hey get inside. Auntie, auntie. They've all come back from jail. Ramanna and all came back from jail? Long live Shankaranna. Say it father. Amma you say it. Long live Shankaranna. Hey Shankara. Don't you dare step inside. First go to Sahukara, fall at his feet and ask for his forgiveness. Then come back. I'll let you inside then. Anna Shankaru. Ramanna let's not live in this village anymore. Your uncle is demon Kamsa. Didn't he take his sister's childrens' lives? Let's not live in his sight. Let's not live in the sight of a man like that. My Bhima who's in jail will come back. I said my Bhima who'll break the thighs of Duryodhana will come. Kariya. You thieving low life. Go to Sahukara and ask for his forgiveness. Only when Sahukara agrees, you'll marry Chenni. Come girl. To get inside my home, I must fall at Sahukara's feet. He'll have me tied to a pole and throw me crumbs till I die. Even if we want to work somewhere, we need to fall at his feet. To marry my Chenni, that Sahukara must give his permission. Stop the van. What's it Mari? I forgot the money box there. Idiot. Appaji. Appaji. What son? You came back? First look out for those 5 thieves. Which 5 people? The ones you sent to jail. Are they back? It's three months already? What did they do? They met us on the way and stole the money. Hey Rudra. Yes boss. Go find those thieves and bring them here. Shankarappa. Dusshasana is coming. Isn't he the the bastard who stripped my Chenni? I'll see. Hey, Sahukara has sent for you all. Come. Go tell him we won't come. Go tell your Sahukara that Bhima has come to break the thighs of Duryodhana. Tell him to come here if he has guts. Did he say that, that black son of a bitch How dauntless he must be. Kaalappa, Mari, let's go. Stripping of Dusshasana. Sahukara? Did you see the plight of your Dusshasana? Appa. Don't mingle with these scoundrels. Come Appa. Hey go home. What? Are you playing games? No,no. Our play is just beginning. Bravo. Hey, will you give the box or not? [In hindi] Rascals, where have you hidden our money? Bring it back. You do something, no? Won't you give our box? [saying like in a play] Oh elder one, Dharmanandana. This heinous man is asking for a box. Should we give it to him or should we give him a knock on his head? Partha, this enemy of ours is begging for the box. Should we give him? Poor fellow, let's give him. What say you Nakula and Sahadeva? May it be done as our elderly commands. Bhima. Anna? Go forth and bring back the box. As you command. This is not our box, this is not our box. Bring the box you stole when pushing the car. Thieving sons of B***hes. If you call us thieves again. I'll pull your guts out and make garland out of it. Shankara. This is everybody's money. Don't steal it. Your generation won't prosper. We were coming from jail. How would we know there was money in the car? You say it's everybody's money. Who knows? This man's son and her could've hogged it all. Shiva,shiva. To make our village like Delhi, these saintly people wandered in the streets collecting the money. If you accuse them, worms will fall in your mouth. Hey... You have just now come back from jail. You'll go back again, you thieves. Did we go to jail for robbing someone? We wanted to help the village and you people sent us to jail. Kaalappa, these scoundrels won't listen to mere words. Go to Chennapura police station. Go tell them I sent for them. Call them, we too want that. Meaning? Call them and then see for yourself. Sahukara, I've seen since my birth. Our villagers hadn't gone to courts or police station. Because of these, we have seen that too. Let's not bring police again. Mylari, they've hogged everybody's money and stand here. How to recover that? Until they return the money, in this village, that no one is to give them food, water or give them any work, banish them so. Banishment. Who are you banishing? To your banishment, our united condemnation, condemnation... You're wicked people who cheat an innocent woman. You're cruel people who skin the poor and desperate. You're heinous people who suck blood of the slaves. Banishment is for you. To your banishment, our united condemnation, condemnation... Creating fear in holy men, you stand stomping on them. You're poisonous snakes that take birth inside the womb of wealth. You're butchers who rip the guts out and torture. Banishment is for you. To your banishment, our united condemnation, condemnation... You ordered this banishment and what happened now? They've two lakhs in hand. They'll cut off their connection with this village and enjoy elsewhere with that money. They'll when they're left on this earth, no? I'll purge them. Yes do that and lose those 2 lakhs too. Let it go. It's everybody's money. I don't care. Is it bigger than my pride? I won't let those who insulted me live. So? They've living in a hut built in Kencha's field. When they're all asleep, I'll have them burnt alive. Yes, have them burnt. They'll be alerted by the heat, and anyway it's a small hut, they'll come out of it easily. Then you'll have it lit under you. That's why I say that sometimes you don't have brain. That's not how it's done. Now, Vishkantha has a good amount of opium with him. Bringing it... Let it be. I'll do that job. Is your shame any different than mine? When you decide to remove them, they have to be. I'll finish it leaving no evidence. Avva, somebody has hit your son. He's lying in the ditch unconscious. Where? Where is he? Go to hell. You play mischief with me? I'll crush you. Where had you been mother? Even a blade of grass laughs at us now. Why? Let it go. Get up everybody, have your meals. Where is Sundarakka? Chenni took her. Where's Kariya? He's gone to Basavanahalli. Don't know when he'll be back. Get up have your food. Get up. Hey Maacha. Lies down like a log right after meals. Ramanna, Shankarappa, Hey Kencha, Avva? What's this? They're lying unconscious? Hey Maacha. Sahukara. Accusing them with false charges, you sent them to jail. After they came back from jail, you banished them. Now, setting fire to their house when they're asleep, you massacred them. Why? why? Because they protested against your oppression... and tried to end your dictatorship. That is their offense, isn't it? Swamiji, if you become a thorn in my way, you'll have to be removed from the monastery and thrown out. Sahukara? To tolerate injustice for the sake of holy throne, Is not the guru's job. To face Adharma bravely... is its determination. Kaalappa Huh? Swamiji has come here with enough courage. Swamiji, what do you want me to do? You want to put me in court and get me hanged? Go, do that. Mylari, Is there a tongue that will speak against me in court? I know that Sahukara. Putting a noose called fear around the villagers' neck, you've smothered the voice of truth. Only Dharma has the power to cut that rope of oppression, only Dharma. In the bright light of that Dharma, wicked people like you will perish. Will perish. Kaalappa. Where is Dharma now? It's wiggling under our feet. Rogues, what you're stomping is just a body, not the Dharma. Those who stomp Dharma, aren't born and never will be. Whose house are you looking for? Where's your Sahukara's house? Sahukara's house? I know where it is. Come I'll show you. Come,come. Madam, this is my house. They won't let me into the house. If I go in, they'll hit me, scold me and throw me out. I won't come inside that house. I won't come. You go yourself. I won't come. Namaskara. Greetings, sit down. What's this you're sitting down? Doesn't matter where we sit in our house. You sit down. Thanks. It's village, to pass time we keep playing for fun. No money, no betting. Who're you? Why have you come? I wanted a glass of water. Who's inside? Bring a tumbler of buttermilk. My name is Malati. Writing stories and novels is my profession. Oh you're a storywriter. What's the connection between our Paduvaarahalli and your storywriting? The people in these photos are from your village, are they not? These rascals belong to our village. What's the connection between you and these villains? I'm writing a book on prisoners' life. So, I've selected these people for that. The prisoners in this photo, after getting out, have they reformed or have they turned worse, I wanted to know. That's why I came here. I was told, if I ask you, I'll know where they're, what they're doing and how they are. That's why I came. No one in these photos is alive now. You mean? Meaning, they were burnt alive in their hut. How did it catch fire? Who knows? Anyway, their sins caught up with them and ignited it and burnt them to death. You drink the cold buttermilk. Give her. That's enough. They were no small trouble to this village. Raping women as they please, ruining the lives of poor. Making troubles for good things, and encouraging bad things. Things they did, were they just one or two? They died. But it's a great injustice to me. How's it an injustice if they die? If they were all alive, writing a book on them, I could've made some 5 thousand. Now it's not possible. What are you talking? Our elders... wrote stories on pious, on good men, on truthful people, on gods, and writing stories on patriots, they made a living... and taught good things to people. What you're doing is... writing stories on villains, wicked, loafers and that kind, do you intend to spoil this society along with you? Let's see, if you are that good, write a story on good, truthful people. What Sahukara? Yes. Where are they now? These good, truthful people. Why? Isn't he sitting opposite to you? To our village, he's like god and eyes. Write a story on him. Why would they write stories on good people like us? Sahukara, If I write stories on good people, I'll get enough god's grace, but what about money? I'll leave. Oh, lady from Bangalore, stop. If you'd written a story on these people, you'd have got, what 5 thousand? Take 10 and write a story on our Sahukara. I can write a story on your Sahukara. But I'll have to stay here for months. Stay here. Our Sahukara will make all arrangements. See, before I sit down for writing, you must give me 2000 in advance. Why? We live on that you see. People who depend on us should be happy right? What she says is right. These writers don't have enough. That's no big deal, we'll give it. Then it's fine. Should we send Malathi to farmhouse or keep her here? Let us keep her here Kaalappa. Where had you been Mari? Malathi, come here. This is my son. Mari Namaskara. She's a writer, she'd come to write a story on those goons. He asked me not to write on them and instead write one on him. I've agreed. Till I finish the story, I'll stay here. Sahukara, who's she? She's from Delhi, Mynaji. My son's friend. She came to make our village like Delhi, now she's not there or here, stuck between two places. That's a long story, you can ask her about it. Kaalappa. Mariji, What are they saying? I didn't understand. Who's she? She's... I am a writer. It's nice meeting you. Good, you know Hindi too? Just a little. Mr. Mari, he spoke about something, what is it? That's something that takes time. Malathi, I like action and thrilling stories. What kind of stories do you write? I too like action stories. Then we both have same taste. Let's go inside. Malathi. What's this Kaalappa? You came here? You're writing a story on our Sahukara, right? I wanted to secretly talk something about it with you. What is it? Our Sahukara is an idiot. I'm the reason for what he is today. He has a value because of my brain. That, I understood the first day I met you. You're writers. You can guage a man's character by just looking at him. But what is that secret you wanted to talk about? You're writing a story on our Sahukara, right? In that, without Connection Kaalappa, there's no Sahukara Sangappa, readers should think that. My name should be highlighted, you must write in such a way. All that I can write, it's something I can do, But your Sahukara is giving me 10 thousand. How much will you give? Malathi, I don't know why, but there's no connection between me and money. Kaalappa, I don't know why but without money, there won't be any connection between my brain and my writing. I have a very good gold necklace. I'll give that, you write. Ok. There's another thing in that. But until you're in this village, you mustn't take that necklace out. That is my condition. Why? Because that was my wife's necklace. So? From children to elderly, everyone has seen it in our village. If they see that in your neck tomorrow, these useless villagers will make a connection between you and me. You shouldn't get a bad name you see. Ok When'll you give me the necklace? Tomorrow. Myna, listen to me Myna. Don't touch me. My body burns when I see you, you are an idiot. The scheme I setup after months of planning, You upset the whole thing in a minute, in a minute. With that 2 lakh rupees, I was planning to do a lot of things. You destroyed all my desires. You let it slip out of hands when we had it. Huh, that was money we got by swindling people showing them the factory. Let it go. Just because it was a small lapse by me, I can't tolerate you calling me an idiot or fool. I too don't want to continue friendship with you. Myna I say don't touch me. Look Mari, you enjoyed me these many days. Think that that's all in your fortune. I won't stay in this village for a minute longer. Look Mari, van's rent, my dress, your dress, for all these I've borrowed money. You know that, right? So, get at least 10 thousand from your father for that. After that, we both go our own ways. If you don't get it, I'll tell everyone that you were the one who hoodwinked villagers in the name of factory and have you sent to jail. Myna, what shall I do? My father won't give if I ask. If you ask, he won't say no. In that you take half and I'll take half. After that we both go our own separate ways. Hello. Thank you. Oh Malathi, when did you come here and why? I like taking pictures of sunset. You two lovers were standing there, position was good, so I took a picture. What's she saying? She's saying we're lovers. Oh Malathi, we're not lovers, we're just friends. That's what. First friends and later lovers. And after that, partners. Partners? I mean life partners. Ok Mynaji, forgive me I disturbed you. Sorry. Carry on. Greetings to Kaalappa. Greetings to you too. I thought I was early. You have come before me? You said you'll give me gold necklace. Women love gold, don't they? Have you brought it? How can I go back on my promise? Take this. What's this? This looks old style. My wife wasn't from your age, right? You go to your hometown and get a new piece done with this. I'll do as you say. Until then let the necklace be with you. When going bakc, I'll ask for it. If you any doubts, take this now. Don't neglect my character in the story thinking I'll cheat. How's that possible? The story starts with Connection Kaalappa. I know, I know. Where are you going? Come along with me. I'll just wander around. Then I'll leave. Necklace belongs to your deity right? There's no doubt. How can he say that it's his wife's, Siddappa? Mylarappa, accusing Kariya of stealing it, he destroyed my daughter's life. We shouldn't let him go. We should expose him with the necklace. Let's go. Siddappa, be quiet for sometime. Don't rush. Sahukara, Sahukara. Those people in the photos, I saw two among them. They were counting piles of cash. Myna, we got our money. really where? how? Kaalappa what is this? Sahukarappa, you be quiet, I don't believe all this. I saw them with my own eyes. I went close to talk to them. Both the money and they disappeared. Where? Near that hill. Let's go. Sahukara. That is the place. Both were sitting there. Here? What's this Kaalappa? She's a write. She's making a story up and telling us. Why should I make up a story? I just went close to talk to them. They ran away like that. What's this Kaalappa? Sahukara, I swear on your son, I personally had them burnt. How will they run away? Sahukara. That's stolen money and before they could enjoy that, they died. So, now they're roaming as ghosts. So you mean what I saw were ghosts? Then what else? What happened? what happened Malathi? What happened? what happened? Hold her, hold her. Nothing, nothing. From now on, I won't go roaming in your village. There are lots of ghosts. Why don't you write a story on ghosts? To write a story I should be with them. What Myna? That Malathi... doesn't look like a writer. She's come here with some plan like us. We should be a bit careful. Understood? Malathi, you go ahead. Sahukara and I will go to farmhouse and follow you. But Kaalappa, I'm scared. We'll be right behind you. Go. Ok, Go. Sahukara. I'm getting doubts about this writer. She says she saw ghosts, and they were counting money. I too have the same doubts. We should keep an eye on her from now on. Srirama has come, to see Sita, walking our village path. Washing the golden feet, removing the evil eyes, offering the light from the lamp of gems Sita saw Rama. Srirama has come, to see Sita, walking our village path. Gently spreading her smile, giving her smooth hands, asking for a loving heart, Sita caressed Rama. Srirama has come, to see Sita, walking our village path. Mounting the chariot of pearls, absorbing the surrounding beauty, crossing the boundaries of time, Sita joined Rama. Srirama has come... to see Sita... walking our village path. Mangala, I can't figure out if I'm Rama or Ravana to this Sita. It's been two years since I believed you are my Rama. Is it? Do you know why I called you here? Why? Look, I know where those scoundrels hid the money you've lost. Really? I'll bring that to you. Take that money, build the factory and save your name. I can't see you worrying like this. Oh, Mangala. Look, while coming bring Mynaji too with you. Why Myna? She shouldn't know that we've found this money. If she doesn't know, how would the factory get built? Mangala, Myna is not from Delhi, she doesn't have her father there and factory won't be built. Everything is bogus. Look, we'll take that money and go to Bombay or Calcutta. Anyway you love me. I too love you. We'll live like Rama and Sita. What do you say? Truly? I swear on my father. Tomorrow, I'll be waiting with the box here at this time. You come, we'll leave without letting anyone know. What? Definitely. Ah, save that for Bombay. Ok, Bye. Good Mangala. You understand now? You bastards. Not just that. Do any of you know what was the total amount collected in the name of building the factory? Yes, 2 lakhs. No. The amount collected was 3.5 lakhs. Then the remaining 1.5 lakhs? It got digested in your Sahukara's stomach. What did you call those 5 who turned against such people? What did they all become? Believing these thieves, we sacrified our children Siddappa. These people must be burnt to ashes like how our children died. Mylarappa. Wait a little. Don't hasten. Malathi. Oh it's you. Where had you been? I was just wandering around. Malathi, didn't you see any ghosts there? Malathi. You're writing my story. I need to share some more points with you. Will you come with me to my farmhouse? Why farmhouse? We can talk here. No, it's appropriate to talk in the farmhouse. Whatever you had to say, you have said. What's left? I'm writing, i'll finish it soon. You'll finish. Going straight from our farmhouse to your newspaper office in Bangalore, you'll finish us there. What's this Sahukara? You're talking like this? We're talking the same thing that you were so secretly talking with that Jangamayya. Malathi, what's the name of your paper? I'm not a journalist, Kaalappa. I'm a story writer. Rudra, take her to the farmhouse. Hello Mangala. Thank you very much. You rascal. You double cross me? I'll kill you. Myna, Myna. Kariya? Yes, it's the same Kariya who's back. Maacha, Maacha. Kencha. We're still alive. You try run away? Run, run now. Our deity's necklace is your wife's necklace. Is it? You murderous bastard. Guruji, Swamiji... Swamiji, these people will kill us. Save us, swamiji, save us. To save or kill you, has to be decided by these villagers who tolerated everything like speechless animals. That's the judgement, that is Dharma. Malathi, you believed my words and came to our village and opened their eyes. You must tell, what punishment has to be given to them. Mr.Shankar, I'm a journalist. To find the truth and show it to the people is our only job. Not judging. Amma, cunningly getting all our property, your brother made us stand under a tree. You must tell what punishment has to be given to them. To burn us alive, these bastards put opium in our food. You must tell what punishment do they deserve. Chenni. They stripped you naked, these shameless goons. What punishment has to be given to them, you tell. These rogues wanted to run away looting everybody's money. How must they be punished, Siddappa? Sundarakka, this Sahukara who burnt your life, which cemetary should we send him to, you tell us. My son will come. If these people are still around... he too will become like them. Chase them, chase them, chase them away. Let them keep running, you keep chasing them away. They... they keep coming back. You keep chasing them away. They keep coming back, you keep chasing them away.
