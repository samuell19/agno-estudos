Maru? Maru? Maru? What? What's up? - Maru's gone. - Maru's gone? Maru? Where did she go? Maru! Maru! Maru! Maru. Maru! Come here. What a relief! That cat... wasn't my cat. Huh, wait. That's... Oh, it's Maru. You're lucky you're alive. Hey, hold up. That cat's mine. I've been looking for her. Right, Maru? No, this is Lily. Lily. I just named her. Oh. I mean, no. I've been looking for her since yesterday. I just adopted her. Yeah, look... I'll reward you for saving her, okay? They say that cats have nine lives. In this life, she's called Lily. Maru. A chick named Lily popped my cherry. Her name just seemed to fit. Hey, don't give Maru a hooker's name. Lily wasn't a hooker! I don't care. Give Maru back. Let's go. Hey, thief! I ain't no thief. You are. That's my cat. - I adopted her. - Give Maru back. - She's Lily! - She's Maru. Lily baby! Lily baby! I'll beat your ass. "I'll beat your ass." - Jerk-off. - Quit following me! I'll go to your home. Go to my home? You don't know where it is! Hey, blonde mohawk! Come back here! Yeah? Hello, it's Shinozaki from Aida Security. Hello? Hello? Yeah? You there? Asa, you were a boxer, right? - No, I wasn't. - Don't lie! I heard you were the Pacific champion. I've got the perfect job for you, so hear me out, okay? I'm supposed to be working security on a pipe-laying job until next week. Oh, you are? Anybody can do that. Only you can do this job, champion. I'm trying to stay out of trouble. There won't be any. You're the champ. One, two. One, two! - This is bullshit. - Hello? Did you say something? Hello? I'll tell them you'll be there at 2 p.m. So be there. Go for it, champion. Later. - Sae? - Yes? You know him? I do. Excuse me. Oh, really? Thank you. I'm the one who requested for you. I'm Saeko Tsuchiya. Hello. I'm from Aida Security. I'll go get ready. It's strange, right? Me hiring you like this. I've lived here for two years now, but I've had no one to ask. It's not strange. We get asked to be a personal bodyguard now and then. It's not that big of a deal. I heard it's a stalker. We broke up about a month ago. But, he says he wants to talk to me in person. The problem is, he tends to act erratically. You don't have to meet him. Just tell the cops instead. It doesn't cost anything. I'd rather not deal with cops. Don't expect too much from me. I'm just a part-timer. I'd rather you did the talking. Actually, I'd prefer that, too. Just pretend you don't know me and stay close. I just want to feel safe. Well, okay. There's nothing to worry about, as long as we have a house. We can live there in peace for 50 or 100 years. We can build that kind of place. I'll build it. Listen... - Mr. Tamaki... - From now on, I'll be working as a foreman. You can quit your jobs and focus on your child. Saeko, you'd rather stay with Hayato, wouldn't you? Mr. Tamaki... Don't call me "Mr. Tamaki." Let's get married. Then, you'll be a Tamaki, too. Mr. Tamaki, Hayato still gets terrified just looking at you. I won't hit Hayato ever again. I'll try to gradually regain his trust. What I want to know now is how you feel. Mr. Tamaki, you helped me realize something. I'm probably no different from you. I told myself that it was for Hayato's sake. But, I was only trying to make myself happy this whole time. I'm sorry. I'm finally aware of that now. From now on, however Hayato feels is how I feel. Then, what about how I feel? Welcome. Oh, Maru! What the hell? - Lunch? - Yeah. Napolitan and cola. Sausage, not bacon on Napolitan. And, bottled cola, right? Yeah, Nori! I'm not with him. I'm not. Sorry. Sit somewhere else. Lily won't eat at all. How was it when she was Maru? What the hell are you doing? Please forget about me, Mr. Tamaki. I've always been a bad person. I have secrets I can't tell anyone. Like I said, don't call me "Mr. Tamaki." What did you usually feed Maru? It was always the same cat food. Do you know the blue-labeled one in a round can? What was it called? Anyway, it's the cheapest one. Gimme a break, man. It's got a picture of a white cat, like this... - I'll be going now. - Wait. Wait. Wait, wait a second. Look at this. You promised to delete them all if I met you today. You haven't heard my answer yet. To what? Your proposal. It's about 200 yen. It's cheaper if you buy a pack. Everywhere? Please, delete every single photo. Saeko, you wouldn't throw away photos of your parents. It's the same thing. It's about 80 yen for a can. 80 yen? You're disgusting. Stop it! Let me go! Knock it off! What are you doing? Leave us alone! Don't use violence against women. Who the hell are you? You hypocrite! Not here. Step outside. Let's talk calmly. Come on. We're going home! Saeko, we're going home! - Come on! Let's go! - Hey, dumbass! What are you doing? How dare you! How dare you! What the hell, man?! Stop it! Stop! Let me go! Let me go! - What's up with you guys?! - Oh shit! - I'll kill you! - Oh, come on! Hello?! Police?! Our customers are fighting! - There's three men! And a woman is... - Saeko! - Stop it! Hurry and come! Saeko! Saeko! - Saeko! - That lady... Is she going to be fine on her own? Don't ask me. It's your fault the cops came. Huh? Didn't that guy piss you off? I bet you wanted to hit him too, Maru. Don't call me Maru. Whassup. You're late, numbnuts. Did you go to Italy to eat spaghetti?! Ouch, it's hot! Forget it, I'm going home. Close up and turn off the lights. Did you laugh just now? You're dead. Dead. Hey Bruno, cover it properly! What's his problem? Hey, let's go. I'm hungry. - Where are we going to? - Beats me! Maru? Maru? Lily? Lily? She ain't here. Lily will come back eventually. She's probably hungry. Lily's a hooker's name, damn it. Hey. Getting the runaround from a cat cramps your style, doesn't it? Shut your mouth, cat face. Cat face? Maru? Maru? I bet... You wanted to hit him, right? Maru? Maru? INFORMATION WANTED Mr. Tamaki? We're starting. Okay. Hey! What are you doing?! Do your job, damn it! You listening? What's wrong? Death would be better than this... Huh? You okay? Hey! Where are you going? It's Shinozaki from Aida Security. Is this Asa? Hello? - What now? - Hang up! No calls during work. Did you mess up the Saeko Tsuchiya job? We've got a problem. Kinda, I guess... We've been getting lots of nasty emails. It doesn't look good. If we get sued, you'll be responsible. - So could you fix it yourself? - Did you hear me? - Hello? - Shut up, asshole. Asa?! - I'll forward the email to you right away. - Umm... - What email? - Just check it! Mama! Ms. Tsuchiya? Honestly, this is a nuisance. BEFORE CLEANING OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES, CLEAN YOURSELF UP SAEKO IS A HYPOCRITICAL SLUT It's not my place to criticize what you do in private. But, the other parents have complained. - Huh? About this? - That's right. They've received it, too. Worst case scenario, the children might see it. The thought of that is just... just... I'm so sorry. No, you're the victim, Ms. Tsuchiya. There's no need to apologize. But you know... You should be more careful when choosing a partner. And be careful how you break up with them. I'm so sorry. Huh? Is that Hayato's father? Hayato! Mama! What is it? You should call first? No... what... The phone! Get the phone! What is it? They're all napping. Call the police! A lunatic is on the grounds! Mama... You won't get caught. Cops are idiots. They'd never recognize you. This guy's useless, too. - He prefers Etsuko Ichihara over Cameron Diaz. - Etsuko Ichihara? Hey, it's your turn next time! He loves Etsuko. - Etsuko? - You don't know her? - Etsuko Ichihara. - Etsuko? That's right. A Japanese famous old lady. Oh, yeah! Oh, right. Go wash my car. - You should learn about Etsuko. - Hello. Oh, hello. What do you want? Well, him. Hey, hey, hey! You! He's that security guy from the other day. Are you gonna hit a bank truck? I'll help you! I'll help! See? See? He's a go-getter. Lily, when do you finish work? Lily? Me? Lend me your car. And, drive as well. You're partly responsible, too. Now what? He's going to a shelter. We're going to take him there. A shelter? An orphanage. Tamaki's gone crazy. The daycare lady freaked out about the kid's safety. So she's putting him in an orphanage. Everything's falling apart like a domino effect. Got no car? No license, either. My boss is a total coward, too. You know man, if you hadn't... Let's go. What class are you in? Maru, keys! Hayato. Um, you can have some if you want. Hayato! I told you not to bite it, right? Lick it down to the very end or you'll get cavities. That was kind of creepy. You're biting it again. I told you not to. Hayato. Don't worry. Children's homes can be fun. You'll make new friends easy. There are lots of weirdos there. They'll teach you new games. His mom ain't gonna like 'em! Please take good care of him. We sure will. Hayato? Mommy's got to go. Be a good boy, you hear me? Thank you. Shall we go? You don't want me anymore? Of course I do. Don't be silly. Next time, I promise I'll protect you! I'll protect you! I'm telling you, I'll protect you! Hey. Don't be such a big baby. Okay? Okay? Hayato, how about we go and play with them over there? Let's go. Let's play together. Hi there! Use this ball if you like. - What's your name? - Hayato. Nice to meet you. Let's play. Damn useless cops. They better deal with that trash Tamaki quickly. Right? Hayato's at the shelter, but... It's fine. It's true that he's not safe with me. Did you hate your mother? When she put you in the orphanage, did you hate her? What? What are you saying? Did I say that? What? I hated my mother... When I realized she wouldn't come back for me. Of course you did... YOU'RE GOING STRAIGHT IN THE CAN CRUSHER This way. Come in. Excuse me. What will you do now? I'll go home. Police are patrolling the area. Hey, do you mind? I know. Why not stay with Maru? No way, man. This is just a part-time gig. I'll be fine. Let's take you back for now. Be careful out there. Gotta take a dump first. I was looking for you, Saeko. Let's go home. Saeko! We're going home, Saeko! We're going. Lily! Lily! You scumbags! Why are you getting in my way?! - What? What? - Chase him! Get back to the office and lock it. Come back here, Tama! Now! Tama! Tamaki! Lily, take off your socks. - What? - Just take them off. Hey, what the hell are you doing? Don't worry. We're police. Sorry for this. Thanks for your cooperation. We were tailing him, but we prioritized protecting the victim. Much appreciated. Yeah... That's it. We'll take her to the station to get her statement. Not so fast. You're making her take the same car as Tamaki? The same car? No, no. Don't worry, she'll be with us. Seriously? They're like the cops on TV. Not to mention the extras. Do you want to see a real police ID? Give us back the socks in his mouth. You got handcuffs, right? Actually, show me that ID. No! Tamaki! Again?! Get the woman! What the hell is this?! What the hell are you doing?! Maru, let's go! You bastards! Sorry. I gave up on Tamaki. Damn it! Not this again... My head hurts like hell... Feels like it's gonna crack any moment... It's not a big deal, just rest it off. No, man! It's an old injury! It woulda been cool if you'd died in the ring. I know! I'm so sorry. It's okay. I can handle this much. I'll be fine soon. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey! Hold on! I said wait. I can't let you get involved any further. At least explain. I nearly had my head split open. That's why I can't let you get involved. Hey! Who the hell were those guys? - Please, just forget it. - I'm asking you! Because Tamaki sent those photos everywhere, the person I'm most afraid of found me. If you stay with me, you'll... - We just need to tell that to the cops. - Please don't! It's all my fault. Then what will you do? I'll go to Tokyo. I know someone who'll help me. - Tokyo? Are you going to abandon Hayato? - I need to do this for him! I'm sorry for causing you so much trouble. So, decided our destination? - Lily, I'll be fine. - We're going to Tokyo. The city full of shitheads. They're not stupid, right? They'll find you soon enough. The problem is... Who's going to look after Maru? Maru, you want me to take care of you? I'm not Maru. Unlike Maru, Lily's doing fine. Quit talking in riddles, man. By the way, who's the person here in Tokyo that's gonna help you? A man named Michiya Kakizawa. He calls himself a management consultant. What does that mean? He's the one who will be in trouble when they find me. I know he'll fix this somehow. Okay, we'll take you to this Kakizawa guy. I'm sorry... But, I cut all of my ties in Tokyo. So, I don't know how to contact him. I didn't want to remember anything from my old life there. Neither did I. I hate Tokyo with a passion. But we can't waste time. Tamaki could show up anytime. A girl at my old job introduced me to Kakizawa. She'll know how to find him. What kind of job? A call girl agency. - I'm sorry. - Why apologize? What's it called? It's in Roppongi. Selfa. What's the girl's name? Mizuki. Her work name's Wakana. Hello? Can I meet Wakana today? Huh? She quit? She's working somewhere else? Where? Help me out! You can't? You really can't? Sure, I'll go. Three times a week. Working girls are impossible to find. Well, you won't find one anywhere who uses their real name. That's right. Sae, were you scouted for that place? No. A moneylender introduced me. A moneylender, huh? Black market? I was married once. All he left me was debt. Wakana, too? She was scouted. That's it! That's it! Do you remember the scout company's name? We got a hit! We got a lead! Why don't you get it? - Come on. - What? How annoying. - Get lost! - Wait! - I said get lost, limp dick! - Ouch! Don't get carried away, you ugly pig! Ugly! Ugly! The hell was her problem... You're a scout for Blitz, aren't you pal? Calm down. We're not with the police. What? - Ministry of Health. - Ministry of Health?! - We're pathology researchers. - Huh? We're secretly investigating an STD carrier. Half a year ago, she worked at Selfa. Wakana. Real name, Mizuki Tada. Know her? We need to stop the infection before it spreads. - I'll call my boss. - Don't do that. Why? Why? Why are we doing it secretly? Do you want word to get out that you're spreading an STD? What kind of STD? We could tell you, but... You'd never sit on a toilet seat again. What the hell? Now I'm all itchy. If you want Wakana from Selfa, our guy Hiroshi handled her. She calls herself Azumi now. Where at? - Have one. - Thank you. Hey! It's been a while! Maru? We shoulda switched cars. They're headed your way. Get out! This way! Hurry! Are you Johnny Depp? Oh, you are! We've never met before, right? I'd never forget a handsome guy like you. Good evening. I'm Azumi. I guess I should say good afternoon. You've got a cat! You do, right? - I do. - Thought so. No way. Please escape. Regret always comes too late. Run away! - Fall when I push you. - Huh? You're on your own now! Well, well. Got the guts to use that? Go ahead and shoot. Really? That's amazing! What?! Oh my god! Somebody, call the police! Murderers! There are murderers! Go ahead and shoot. Shoot, you coward. Go on. Shoot already, damn it! Why don't you go ahead and shoot? Run. I'm beat! - That was so scary! - You got a great voice! Oughta perform on stage. That was crazy, man! Totally crazy! Oh, I'm exhausted. So crazy! We did it, all of us! We did it! - That was crazy! - Like insane, dude! I was shaking like hell. The whole time. I thought I was going to pull the trigger. I know you, right? - I'm Saeko! - Oh, Sae! Who are they? It scared the shit outta me! I ain't never been so scared! I'm glad I'm still alive. - It's all good! - Man, that was crazy. Totally crazy. - No, no. Don't. - What's that? - You can't touch it. - Let me see it. - Especially not you. - Give it here. I'll carry it. - No, nope. Never. - Give it! Come on! Give it to me! Give it? Crap. Run! Hurry! Me, too?! Lily! Hey. Who the hell are those guys? Those guys are... Private SPs, for a politician. What do they want with you? Two years ago, that management consultant Kakizawa hired me. I... I set a trap for the politician. I'm just as bad as Tamaki. Hey, come on. Come on, go get it. Okay. Yes? Sir? She's here. Hey, get out! I'm done with you. Go on! Saeko. Sir? Sir? Let's do this. What is that? Doctor feel-good. Wait! Wait! I took photos, too. But they were never made public. Kakizawa used me as leverage for his demands. He's probably still using me. That politician is afraid I'll testify against him. I never wanted to testify in the first place. That's why I took Hayato and ran. I was prepared to release the photos if push came to shove, though. Sae, who is he? Who's the politician? Sosuke Nagumo. A ruling party executive. That was ballsy, Sae! I had no idea. Back then, nothing scared me. Me and Hayato against the world. But now, I'm scared. Because it really is me and Hayato against the world. Hello? Mr. Kakizawa? Remember Sae, who used to work with me? Saeko Tsuchiya. It's really important. And really urgent! NAGUMO TO KEEP POST DESPITE GAFFE So that's that. Can't wait to hear from you! I left Michi a message. He'll probably help out. If you get caught, it's bad for him, too. Thanks. What does Kakizawa do? Michi? I'm not sure. He works with politicians, company presidents and yakuza. I'm not sure, but he's like a broker. I'll go see Kakizawa alone. We'll take you, like I promised. We still have to deal with Tamaki, too. Yeah, that's right! Let them protect you like a princess. Even Michi probably wouldn't kill these guys. At worst, we could always leave Japan. Can you afford that, dumbass? Dumbass... Italian? Napolitan? There's no American food! I'm like, totally allergic to cats. It's cute, right? Go on, you can have it. Thanks! Weird. You ran away, but now you're back for Mr. Kakizawa. The way I see it, life's like a one-way maze. One wrong turn and it's over! Don't you think? - What? - Right? - Hey, Mizuki. - Huh? Mazes are fun because you can keep looking for a way out. Oh, yeah! Now I get it! You're right! That's so clever! I feel courageous now! Sae! She's no good. I can't stand her. Because you didn't get a gift, too? No. What was your name again? - Asa. (Also means "morning") - It's still night. No, Hideaki Asa. It's my name. Hideaki Asa, he says. An ex-boxer. No, he works security now. Sae? Michi's on the phone. Mr. Kakizawa wants to talk to you. Hello? This is Saeko. It's been a while. You better stop by before you go home. Thanks. See ya! Lily. Okay. It's underworld sightseeing time. What is it? Forgot something? Who the hell are you?! I'll call the cops! Where's Saeko? - Saeko... - Like I'd ever tell you! Who are you? I asked you where Saeko is. Saeko... Saeko... Saeko... Saeko! Welcome! Party of how many? Someone's waiting for us. Go right in! Welcome. Welcome. Is that him? Hello. I'm Kakizawa. Hello. Have a seat. Well, thanks for coming. I've heard everything. Your discretion is appreciated. Problem solved. Thank you very much. It's not great, but please order what you like. Feeling hungry? Have you eaten? Excuse me! - Excuse me. - Yes? He already got paid for this part-time gig. I'm simply grateful. Please don't be offended. It's simply creepy. Looks like a lot of money, too. Well, why did you go through all this trouble? Well, why pay us all that money? It's Saeko's price. Excuse me. I must take this call. Hello? Yes. I'm aware of that, yes. We have several clients awaiting organ transplants. They'll be useful for that. Yes. Thank you. Goodbye. Sorry about that. So, how much do you know about this situation? Mr. Kakizawa, that's... Nothing really. Actually... I knew right away that she'd run off somewhere. It was a managerial error. And a stupid predicament. Hey. That stupid predicament was your fault, wasn't it? You can fix it, right? Please don't be mistaken. Our job is to help people. There are people who run economics, politics, everything. We help those people. You putting a price on Saeko? Cash facilitates simple solutions. It transcends race, religion, everything. Take this money. Eat good food, screw beautiful women and use it to your satisfaction. Like I told you, these men are... Huh? Are we... Being threatened? It's a symbol of my gratitude. Please accept it. Aren't we both... trying to help people? Are you too dumb to realize we ain't swallowing your shit, Mr. Kakizawa? You've changed, champion. Former Asia Pacific featherweight boxing champion! Hideaki Asa! I saw a video of you. KOed in your first defense. Nearly died, then retired. You liked to run your mouth a lot, but you wanted to find the mother who abandoned you. Your dramatic story made you popular. Fear made you look me up? However... however... That story about your mother, you used it to make a name for yourself. It was fake, wasn't it? You could say that you actually abandoned her. You hated her for spreading her legs to make a living. So you decided to use your mother. Back then... You were living large, am I right? Where'd you hear that? Your old supporters club chairman, Mr. Hashiba. He's a big man in our syndicate now. I've dined with him on a few occasions. I know. Shall I ask him to join us? It was the other phone. Excuse me. Hello? Oh, it's Michi here! Thanks for calling! Please take it. We'll be... fine now. Thank you for everything. Really, thank you for everything. Party of three coming in! - Welcome! - I'm so hungry! I want to eat a lot. Sure, go ahead! Yes, that's right. It's worth much more. Yes. Please do. Please leave those two alone now. Hello? Long time no see. Ka-ki-za-wa here. I'd like to know Mr. Nagumo's plans for today. Yes. Anywhere, anytime. Mommy, that's... Don't look. No, I'd like to talk to him in person. Please do. Okay. Bye now. Give me your tongue. Your tongue. I bet your exile made you horny. Didn't it? Huh? Huh? Are we really done? Maru, you promised Hayato you'd bring his mom back. I didn't. - You did! - I didn't! Really? The woman said she'd be fine. You... Woulda been a lot cooler... If you'd died in the ring. I know. What the fuck? This fucking sucks! Why did I come here? It's just like your last match. You lost before you even fought this time! Why did I come? What was I expecting?! This sucks... The victim is Mizuki Tada, age 25. She was stabbed repeatedly and died instantly. Witness reports say the suspect was in his 30s or 40s, around 170 centimeters tall and in construction wear. Police are urgently investigating his whereabouts. Tamaki. What the hell? I'm starving. We ain't had nothing since lunch. Wanna eat? I hope Maru's okay. I don't want her going to the pound again. What? I know. We ain't finished with this yet. So what? We go on the run with them for the rest of our lives? I'm just a failed boxer working security. And part-time at that. What can I do? You know who we're up against? No fucking way, man! Leave it alone! Just lay low and go home! We don't even know where Saeko is now. She's been sucked into the criminal underworld. Just leave it. Shit! This is fucking bullshit! What the fuck, man?! Who's gonna feed Maru?! Don't tell me I lost before I even fought! Don't look down on me! Lily, turn back for Tokyo. I'll do it. Are you happy now? I'll do it. You bet your ass I'll do it! I knew it! So, how do we find Sae? You know how, right? You know how to find her. Thank you, sir. Mr. Nagumo. You've looked for that woman this whole time? Surely you don't need her anymore. She needs to pay for what she did. Our relationship's been mutually beneficial these past two years. You were able to avoid losing your post because of my hard work behind the scenes. That's exactly why. We're in the same boat now, so she's an irritation. I want her eliminated. That aspect of your personality is rather endearing. My corporate clients are growing impatient. They want you to push through the Labor Contract Act amendment. It's a crucial time for you. Please don't cause trouble unnecessarily. Are you trying to take advantage of me? Why would I do that? Let's not be suspicious of each other. This is your doing, Kakizawa! I'll give you the woman. Do whatever you like to her, to your satisfaction. However, killing her... Is out. Are we clear? All things considered, killing her is the riskiest move of all. If you're not extremely careful and prudent, it will all lead back to you. Which one? Let's go in. No-class bums will always be no-class bums. Am I right, champion? What I did was truly... A betrayal of all you did for me, Chairman. I'm deeply sorry. I never wanted to see your face again. Now you want me to be your snitch? No, not like that... You runnin' around with a broad? Kakizawa called yesterday. He wanted to know about you. He's a no-class bum, too. He had the nerve to call first thing in the morning. Hey. They're not the same. You're as conniving as always, Asa. Listen up. This guy here used my money to pay for whatever he wanted. Broads, booze, food. His operation when he nearly died. In spite of all that, he took off without saying a word. I'm so sorry. On top of that, who got saddled with debt when you took off? How much did you borrow using my name? How much did you borrow? I had to apologize to everybody. I did. I had to clean up your damn mess. I did. I hid your shame about your mother for you, but I never thought you'd bring shame on me. Boxing was the only thing I ever had. I told Kakizawa you're not worth the effort. I had to listen to that bum's no-class voice. Ever since he hooked up with Nagumo, he acts like he's top dog. Eat up, alley cat. I'm truly sorry! That's a nifty trick you learned there. Mr. Hashiba! I'm truly sorry! I'm sorry! I'm truly sorry! I'm truly sorry! I'm truly sorry! Asa, this is pretty fun. I'm truly sorry! I'm truly sorry! I'm truly sorry! Mr. Hashiba! I'm truly sorry! Enough already! What are you doing?! It's okay. Asa. You found a good sidekick. Treat him well. This should do for an apology, plus change. Take this as change. What do you wanna know about Kakizawa? Or would you prefer the woman? And kid, don't go flashing that piece around. You'll die. Devote what's left of your shitty life to that woman. And don't ever show your face 'round here again. Damn, it's charcoal now. Go get me more. As you wish. Relax. This'll solve your Nagumo problem. That guy... Still loves you. Mr. Kakizawa... your room key. Excuse me. A gun's not romantic enough, huh? It ain't like that. "It ain't like that." It is. Sir. Your usual room. How did you... How long till Nagumo gets here? Not long... at all. Either you wait for Nagumo or follow our plan. Decide. You're going in circles. Make every photo you've got on them public. Expose them yourself. Are you crazy? If I do that... Lily's boss can arrange fake passports for you and Hayato. Kakizawa's money will be enough. By the time it blows up, you'll have a new life overseas. I can't! You can! Trust me! Exciting, huh? It only takes one moment to change you life. I can't make Hayato suffer because of me anymore. It's okay! Hayato loves you! Good to see you again. Come in. Go. You've played hard to get. Please don't be like that. I won't kill you. I'll do everything else. Come on. I've brought him. Oh boy. Our boss has a sick mind. When it's time, I'll take you to her room. See? I told you we'd make it worth your time. Don't forget... To kill her. Oh, sorry. Sorry. That's right. The second and third floors. Yes. How many square meters? Yes. Die! You bitch! Saeko! Saeko! We gotta go! The girl's gone. With some guy. Eliminate them by any means! I'll have Kakizawa cover it up! Bastard... Are you alright? Leave me and go. Don't be silly! Lily's... right outside. The car's... the car's waiting. I'll... take care of the rest. Leave me! Please. Please, leave me. I'm... I'm just... a piece-of-shit loser. You gotta throw shit away. Then let's go together. Run away overseas with me. Please teach Hayato... some new games. But nothing too bad. What is this? Am I hallucinating? Am I hearing things? Was that wrong of me? It was wrong. Very wrong. Damn it... So very wrong. Kakizawa? Where's Saeko? You're... Her... I could've guessed... You're weird-looking. You... And me... Keep watch, you dumb fuck! Mr. Nagumo? I'm coming in. Kimura here! Kuramochi, emergency! Huh? Lily ain't here. Did they take him to the pound? Kuramochi! We need to get to the boss! Nice. Found you. I love you. Hey, scrotum head. Lily... Way to go, man. You dumbass. You got great timing. Now we got no choice... We're gonna run... And run... And run... For the rest of our lives. Not much gas left. Are you... talking about me? Maru, this ain't the right time for you to die. You always get that wrong. I really... I really don't wanna die! I'm scared! I really don't wanna die! I ain't... I ain't done nothing with my life yet! I ain't even started yet! I'm scared. I don't wanna die... Lily... Saeko... Thank you... I don't wanna say that! Lily, hurry! Don't... don't let Maru die! Wow, great! You're good at it! Hayato! Mama! Welcome back. I'm back. Bruno? The drowned man has been identified as Michiya Kakizawa, age 41. He was a key figure in the scandal that emerged after Sosuke Nagumo's death. Police are investigating the possibility of murder. Hey, you made it back, too? I just got back now. Hey. What? Do I stink of hospital? I bet you're hungry. Come on. I'll give you your favorite. There. I guess you're my only sidekick, Maru. Oh... I'm Maru now. Okay, you can be Lily after all. It's all the same. Sorry. I was out having a pretty good time. Hey. How many lives have you had? I'm on my third. You know... I think I might get it right this time. Think so, Lily?
