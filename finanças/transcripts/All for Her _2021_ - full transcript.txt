Here we go again, huh? Mm-hmm. Hey. It's okay to be nervous, kiddo. I-it's just a check in, like every year, right? - Yeah, but... - So it's no big deal? I'd just rather be at school right now. you are definitely your mother's daughter. I'm sorry, baby, I didn't mean to... I-it's okay, dad. - Karlie... - I-I wanna make sure... We get our good spot, away from the air vent. - Karlie, just wait. - no. - Hey. Wait up. - Mm... Give me your hand. Thank you, thank you. Okay, okay. - Wait right here, okay? - Okay. Okay. Hi. hi. How can I help you? I'm here to check in Karlie Cronswell. yeah, go ahead and sign in. That's Karlie with a K. yes, yes. uh, do you know if, uh, Dr. Cronswell is free right now? She's my sister. yes, she's in the radiology department, But as soon as the technologist is available, They'll come and pick you up. Okay. Thank you. mm-hmm. I hope they're gonna be okay. Yeah. Me, too. - Come on. Let's go make camp. - Okay. Okay, we're not sitting there. Want some snacks? - Yes. I'm so hungry. - Okay. Me, too. All right, we got popcorn, cookies... Uh, I can't eat any of that, can I? Oh, right. Not until after your tests. - Mm-hmm. - I'm sorry, kiddo. Epic dad fail. What's the point of making us get here so early Just so we can sit around and wait to... Dad... I lied. I am nervous. I'm-I'm sorry. I wanted to be brave. Hey, being brave doesn't mean you're not nervous or scared. You know what? Why don't we do some... Reading? - you brought it? - yup. - I wish mom was... - I know. Me, too. But why don't we get cozy and, uh, I can read this to you? - Or I could read it to you? - Now, that sounds great. "once upon a time there lived a strong and passionate Warrior princess named kay And her pet elephant named Indra. She possessed a beautiful amulet that provided her entire kingdom With protection and peace." Oh, she's here, she's here. Oh, my god, Devina! How did it go with the big suits? Um... That bad, huh? Uh, well, you know, it wasn't bad exactly. They liked the character, and your design, Leo. Whoo! What did they say about your show, though? They said it was promising, but that it wasn't there yet. What does that mean? It means I haven't cracked her character yet. They said the princess, her life just seems too perfect. Maybe you could give her a flaw? Like, maybe she's clumsy. maybe she breaks everything. Hm. No! No, no. I think we have to dig a bit deeper. See, the princess has the biggest heart in the kingdom. So what's holding her back from Becoming a true warrior princess? It's a kids' book. Does it have to be that deep? Yes. The problem can't come from the princess. That's not her. It's gotta come from something else, I, I just don't know what yet. Go on, Leo. Yeah, get out there. Um, ahem, it's all good, V, I'm running to the commissary For a little post-work, pre-dinner coffee. - You want... - the usual. For both of us. Okay. Thanks, Leo. Don't be so hard on yourself. You have months before they finalize the shows Getting made this year. That's true, and it's not as if they said Never bring this idea back to us. Exactly! And I know you'll finally... I just have to keep trying, it has to happen eventually. I mean, it has to, right? Are we still talking about getting your show made? Oh. or is this about the baby? How are you so insightful all the time? - It's kind of creepy. - I'm a Gemini. And I know you, Devina. You always find a way. - Thanks, tor. Appreciate that. - Anytime. Can you text Leo and tell him I'm not gonna need that coffee? Absolutely. I'll drink it for you. Plus, it will give me some alone time with him. does Leo even know you like him? no, he's an Aquarius. - And? - So, no. He's oblivious. come on. Oh! Rick? Rick? Oh. Rick. - You found me. - Well, you left a trail. Go ahead. - Open it. - Okay. - Very clever. - right. Oh, Rick, this is very sweet... And a little weird. I just thought I'd... No, it's, it's very thoughtful. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey. Fifth time's the charm, right? I don't believe that's quite how it... Oh, how'd the, uh, how'd the pitch go? Oh. Later, later. We're on a strict fertility timeline. Yes, we are. - Is it time? - Almost. - You ready? - Mm-hmm. Okay, ten, nine, eight, Seven, six, five, Four, three, two... So the idea is Cam and Lolo get, like, picked up And they got in the location, they travel around the world And they're checking out all these different cultures. It's like, they're looking at Hong Kong, And th-though their fortune cookie... I love that. Oh. - And then... - yeah, I'm sure the... - show her the Mexico one. - yes, they do. yeah, they go to Mexico and then They get the... Ooh, but what if... they should probably get like some of, like, The cultural experiences and... absolutely. What if... from here to here, like, Bethlehem and then... and we're, like, actually following them on the flyover? 'cause what... What-what do you think? What do you think if we're actually like flying with them? Like, it's not... it doesn't appear the transfer was successful. We'll know for sure in a few days. What does that mean? V, stay-stay positive. What do you wanna do? I... I really don't know. We can try again. Maybe it's just not in the cards for us. V. V. V! Hey. You know the first thing my dad told me when I first started Working construction with him? Is this gonna be one of your long stories? What, you don't like my long stories? no, I-I do, I do. I-I just... Look, he told me that "you can plan all you want. You know, you can measure everything Two, three, four times, and you should, Because you never know what's coming for you." Uh-huh. "but you just got to be prepared to be unprepared." Oh, V, I'm sorry, I-I was just trying to... no, it's these, um... These hormones have me bursting into tears every five minutes. I'll have to get this under control before my mum visits. Was the story that bad? No, it was, um, it was pretty good, actually. Hey. You always have it under control. Remember that. - Thanks, Rick. - Hm. Hm. Um... I, uh... I might need a bit more time before the next round of ivf. Yeah, of, of course. Take all the time you need. - You got this. - Thanks. So, mum, what do you think? - About? - Well, the house. This is the first time you've seen it in person. Hm. It's wonderful, dear. Even better than it looked in the pictures. Well, Rick does great work. - Doesn't he? - Well, thanks, babe. - Oh! Hi. - Yes, well... Sorry! Got held up leaving the hospital. - Maggie, dear. - Ani! It's so nice to see you again. Has it really been since the wedding? Unbelievable. I'm just gonna run inside and freshen up. Uh, you know where it is, sis. Don't wait to eat on my account. you heard the doc. Go for it. Mm, mum, it might be easier If you just pick the burger up with your hands. Yeah, ani, uh, don't keep up appearances on our account. We're all family here. I'll go get the onion rings. Yum. Thanks, babe. - You hate onions. - What? Your entire childhood, you'd throw a fit If you even saw an onion. Well, tastes change and everything Rick makes is great. Then why aren't you eating? I'm saving room for onions. Well, you shouldn't. You're looking thin and more tired than usual. I think it's all those chemicals you're putting in your body. This is our last round of ivf. We're actually taking a break From the hormones right now, mum. - Really? - Yeah. I'm trying to sell this show at work, So it just makes more sense. They're finally letting you have your own ideas? Well, they always let me have my own ideas, mum. But, yes, it's the first time I'm pitching my own show. It's pretty hard work, but I have the best team. - But do you like it? - I do love it. Cr... We're creating content for kids that's gonna make them More curious, more kind, hopefully a bit braver. - It's what I've always wanted. - Hm. That's all I've ever wanted, for you to love your job, So that you can take care of yourself. I just hope that you're, you know, Being careful with your finances. But, uh, you'll be all right if... - Sorry I took so long. - If what, mum? - What are we talking about? - Oh, nothing. Just girl stuff. I know a thing or two about that. Mother-daughter stuff, actually. These are, uh, best served hot. - Mm-hmm. - Ani? - Oh, yes. - I know you like onions. Uh-huh. Yeah. It's great. - Devina? - V? Are you okay? I've got this. You didn't have to make yourself sick to prove me wrong. It wasn't the food, mum. Work's been a lot lately. It's clearly just taking a toll. Hm, well, if that's the case, you, it's probably a good idea That you've dropped this baby-craziness. So that's why you're being like this, Because Rick and I are trying to have a baby? Well, first you take off to America, And I didn't say anything, and then out of the blue You meet and marry this man, and I still didn't say anything. And now all of a sudden you want to have his baby. And you've only just met him. We've been together For two years, mum! You never once mentioned wanting children. I'm not having this conversation with you right now. In fact, I'm gonna chalk this whole incident Up to you having jet lag. - Just... - Devina, listen to me. Please! I see the attraction. I do. He's a good-looking guy. Nice. Nice, mum? He's a bit more than nice. Rick's the one who wanted you to come. He, he booked you the Airbnb so you could stay for a while, See the house, get to know him a bit better. That doesn't change the fact that he's just not your type. Well, my "type?" Rick's the type of man who wants a woman To be a homemaker, like his mother. You love Cora. You two were talking and laughing the whole... - She's a life-long homemaker! - And his sister is a surgeon! V, men want wives who are like their mothers. And that's what he'll expect of you, to stay home, Raising the kids, making him dinner. - He makes me dinner. - Well, that'll all change... The only thing that will change is that we'll have children, Which is something that we both want. Like you both want onions? Why are you lying to me for the sake of this man? "this man?" this man, mum? Rick's my husband. He's not dad. So stop treating him like it. I didn't think your father would turn out to be The man that he was. I know. I know you didn't. Sorry. Is, uh, everything all right in here? We'll be right out. Let me make you some tea. We'll see if that'll settle your stomach, hm? The tea, tea's over there. - I just love these yellows. - do you? - Yeah, they go really well. - good, good, good. We were kind of worried about that, so... - No, they're bright and bea... - your batteries, my lady. Thank you. timely. Love it. We were just talking about all the parrots And she loves the gold that you chose. Oh, sweet, okay, 'cause we were thinking, like, Is it too obvious or... Excuse me, guys. - Was it the coffee? - I don't know. - You should go check. Yeah. - I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Devina, are you... Oh. Oh, my god. - It finally happened. - Ooh. You're... You're pregnant. What? Sadly, that's, uh, that's a little bit impossible. Unless, um... Wait a minute. I'll get Leo to pick up a pregnancy test From the drug store. Tor, could you ask him to get two? - Just to make sure. - Absolutely. Excuse me. - Hey. - hey. Whoa. - What's all this? - I can be domestic sometimes. - You made sushi? - Yes, I did. Now, you ordered takeout and set up to make it Look like you made sushi. Okay, okay, okay, but only Because I love you very much And did not want to subject you to my cooking. - I appreciate that. - Yeah. You look beautiful. You're wearing your first-date dress. - You remember? - Of course. you look incredible. - Thank you. - How come you wear the same one? You know, I like saving it for special occasions. - Oh? Good news at work? - Mm. - You could say that. - Well, well, then. I can't just toast my girl with water. we gotta break open a bottle. - Uh, white or the red? - Neither for me, Rick. Why not? - Are you serious? - Yeah. h-how? The embryo transfer was successful. oh, wait. Careful. Careful. The doctor said to just be Extra cautious until she's run more tests. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - No, don't be, don't be. - It's okay. - No, it's-it's more than okay. It, it's incredible. We're having a baby. We're having a baby! Fifth time really was a charm, huh? yeah. - I love you so much. - I love you, too. - Dad? - Hm? why'd you stop reading? - You're crying. - I'm not crying. - It's, it's weird when you cry. - I am not crying. Don't give me that grandma ani face. It's not even the sad part of the story. Princess kay and elephant Indra just got the oracle To tell them where the bad guys took kay's magic necklace. Now they know where to go! That's good news. - What's good news? Hey! - Aunt Maggie! - Mm! - Any word on how much longer? I just got out of surgery, I thought I'd come Check on my favorite niece. Were you, uh, making your dad cry? - I was only reading. - I am not crying. You did always have an aversion to books. okay, I'm more of a tactile learner. And for that I am grateful, saved me from having to compete To be the smart sibling. Karlie with a K. yeah, I think that's you. Hey. What would princess kay do? Come on. - Okay. - We'll see you a little later. Yeah. - hi. - hey, guys. who's this little trooper here? - right this way. - Thank you. Doing great, kiddo. - Will you keep reading? - Yeah, of course. "so the princess and her elephant took another step Closer to taking back her necklace and the kingdom." You guys! That's wonderful! Oh, isn't it wonderful, ani? Or should I say grandma ani? - It's certainly a surprise. - It was a surprise to us, too. Our little miracle. I just hope it doesn't get in the way Of you getting your own show. Well, why, why would it? I don't think anything could keep devina From doing what she wants. So this is kinda what I'm thinking for the backdrop In that second scene, you just see it in the distance, Some nice soft sunset in the background. Um, but what I'm really excited to show you is this markup From the pendant that you were talking about for kay. I love it, I have a hunch that kay's necklace is going to be Very important for her kingdom. Some sort of inherited magical power That's going to keep everyone safe. Would you excuse me, Leo? Is it that bad? Babe, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I-I'm fine. I need to make sure. - Can you walk? Okay. - Yeah. yeah, I'll, uh, head over to the site As soon as we're done here. No, I know, we just, we wanted to be sure, you know, so... No. No, no, I think she'll be fine. Okay. Okay, bye. You didn't have to drive me here, Rick. I don't do anything because I have to. I wanted to be here. So here I am. Hm... How is it you always know the exact, perfect thing to say? Can I record you saying that? - Need to record me saying it? - Oh, yeah. I could use it against you whenever we fight. did I have to do this last year? No. I don't remember having an x-ray. It's actually not an x-ray. Those are just for bones. The MRI helps the doctors see even more important stuff. Like what? Well, like your lungs. - And your heart. - Hm. Now, unfortunately, your dad can't come with you For this one, sweetie. Hey, hey, hey. I'll be sitting right there the entire time. - Okay? I promise. - And then we'll finish reading? Yes, of course. I gotta take freckles. Sorry. - It's okay. - We'll be rootin' for ya. - Mwah. Heh-heh. - Okay. You got this. you've reached devina. You know what to do. Wish your outgoing message was longer. I like hearing your voice. That's mostly why I called, to hear it. But, uh, we miss you here. I miss you. You'd think these tests would get easier, you know, Taking her for these tests over and over. But it's never easy. It's always terrifying. Every time I'm so scared that they're gonna find something, You know, that she's not gonna be... Well, I don't have to tell you, right? I brought her your book, though. That seems to be helping. I think, I... Dammit! - Ah. You ready? - Uh-huh. Only the best sparkling cider for my wife. Oh, you're sweet. All right. Oh. Got to tell from this, right? Oh, I always forget. How am I gonna do that with sparkling cider? all right. - Okay. - To a clean bill of health. - And the baby's. - And the baby's. Ooh. You okay? And that's really what sets princess kay apart. She's a little girl with a big heart Who, who must protect this power at all, all costs... - devina? V, are you okay? - yeah? devina, are you all right? Oh, yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm... I'm just getting in my head about all this. - Or something. - Let's just take a quick break. you could sit. Would you like to sit? No, no, no, we've got to, we've go to finish This pitch, guys. We've worked too hard. Take a seat. Let me, let me just rewind and go back a little. devina, are you okay? Yeah. you need me? Dr. Davis, telephone, please. Dr. Davis, telephone, please. hey. ooh. - Hey. - Hi, Maggie. Ooh. Ooh. I don't want you to take this the wrong way, But you're not looking very good. Huh. Well, actually, that's why I'm here. Well, mags, I feel awful, But my doctors keep telling me it's totally normal For someone with asthma. Since when have you had asthma? Since they told me I did, two months ago. Ooh. Any other symptoms? Just normal pregnancy things. Exhaustion, feeling sick all the time. Sick how? Like, morning sickness? Um, no, more like, um, shortness of breath. Any dizziness? Loss of balance? - A lot of that. - Okay. Let's skip lunch and see if we can get you in to see someone. Wait, what? There are complications during pregnancy That are regularly misdiagnosed as minor problems, Especially in first-time mothers over 30 and women of color. But should I be worried? Is-is-is the baby going to be... All I'm saying is we should be sure That everything's all right. It's probably nothing. But I'm glad you came to see me. You and your brother are terrible liars. hey. How are my two favorite ladies? What's up, mag? - Hey, babe. - Hey. - Mwah. - Hm... What's wrong? So I had a friend, Dr. Miller at the hospital Run a few tests on devina yesterday. Oh. She didn't tell me. She didn't wanna worry you over nothing. Neither of us did. But it's not nothing? Devina has a rare condition called pulmonary hypertension. - It's like high blood pressure... - high blood pressure? Well... - Loads of people have that. - Well... This particular kind makes it especially hard To get your blood from your heart to your lungs And over time it could lead to... Heart failure. Well, there's, there's gotta be a-a treatment. I mean, medication. I mean, we've got the best insurance. Uh, there are... All right, so what's the problem then? But I'm pregnant. Any of the treatments that would help devina, They'd put the baby at further risk. - Further risk? - It's a chronic illness. Okay. Chronic how? It's not something that will simply go away. Even if devina could take the meds or get a lung transplant... Lung transplant? What? I know this is a lot, for both of you. - But you've gotta stay calm. - Calm? H-h... How am I supposed to stay calm when you just told me That my wife and my baby's life might be at risk? Maggie, could you give us a minute? Of course. - Babe... - I know. I'm-I'm sorry. Babe, but you're gonna be okay, right? The doctor said I just have to be careful And take it easy at work. That's-that's really all I can do. But it's not a sure thing that you'll be okay? - That the baby's gonna be okay? - We're both at risk. But the doctor said she was strong and-and growing well And-and developing corr... She? W-we're having a girl? That's what they think. Jeez. I'm sorry, this is, ah... It's just a lot to process right now. No, I-I know. I know. I'm sorry. No, no, no, it's not, it's not your fault. It's not your fault. It would be so much easier if it was, wouldn't it? No. If it was something I'd done wrong, Something I could improve or change, I could handle this. 'cause that's my job, isn't it, to find solutions to problems, To rewrite things, but-but right now I can't even make it Through a sentence without feeling helpless. Hey. You are not helpless. Okay? When I met you, you were barefoot on your desk, uh, Trying to rewire the lights at your old office. Who does that? - I didn't want to wait. - That's what you said. You said you would not come down from there Until it was finished. Because I knew I could fix it myself. That's how I was raised, to fix things, Finish things on my own. I-I've never not known how to fix something, Rick, Until this, and-and my stupid show. Hey, guess what? You're not on your own anymore, okay? And your show's not stupid. I just, I don't know how to not know what to do. I know the feeling. But you know it's like my dad said, right? "you gotta be prepared for the un..." - unprepared. - Unprepared. Your dad and his stories, I know. But, Rick, the doctor said... The doctor said, If this doesn't work, we... If I lose this baby, we can't try again. Not ever. It's okay. - I'm scared. - Yeah, me, too. Me, too. - V, don't. - Hm? What? - I got that. - I can handle a casserole, Rick. - Get out of the way. - After what happened at work? Come on, tori shouldn't have even called you about that. Plus, my mum's still here. She's gonna know something's wrong if I'm just Sitting around doing nothing. Well, Ani's gonna find out eventually. No, she's not. She's only here for one more week... And you'll still have this thing. Look, the doctor said the worst thing for me Right now is stress. And physical exertion. Combined with stress, Rick! If I'm gonna keep my stress levels low, I cannot have my mother giving me another one of her lectures. Please. My mother cannot know about this, okay? Okay. - Thank you. - Be careful. I will be. Oh. Here's the food we were promised. - oh. - V, you okay? - Yeah. - devina? Devina? - baby? - devina? - Rick? - baby! Rick. Rick! Rick, we need help! devina? - Devina! - Rick? Devina? - baby... - What happened? Ah... I'm, uh, I'm fine. - no, you're not. - What? thanks. I can't sleep. I keep thinking she's gonna have an episode While I'm asleep or I'm at work and-and... This isn't easy and devina isn't making it any easier Insisting on still going to work, Throwing this going-away party For ani, who she should've told. Ah, you know devina, she's... She thinks she's gonna make her deadline For her show to get picked up. I know. But I wish she'd at least consider... - What? - There is another option. One that would improve Devina's chances, but she won't even co... Wait. Her, her-her chances? She's got a 50-50 shot at surviving this pregnancy, Rick. You never said. I didn't want to. What is it? What is the other option? Well... Since the life of the mother is in jeopardy, uh, There's a chance that we'd have to terminate the pregnancy. Maggie, you... Hey, uh, we should go sit with her. - Oh. - thanks, Maggie. - Let me get this for you. - Thank you. - Sure. - Well... - Okay? Okay. - Yeah. Thanks. So, mum, what'd you think? I think you shouldn't be wasting your time throwing a silly party For me when you have a work deadline looming. Devina's got it all covered. Oh, so you've already finished your pitch, devina? Well, no, not quite yet, but it's... Oh. Devina shouldn't be making you do all this... - I-I didn't ask her to... - I offered to help. Thank you, dear. Being pregnant sadly Does slow a woman down. You know what, mum, You're absolutely right. I really should be getting back to writing, so... If you'll all excuse me. devina. Devina, wait. That was a bit overdramatic. Why are you treating her like this? - Excuse me? - Rick, maybe you should just... No, she has done all of this for you. she has been trying so, so hard. Since you've gotten here, all of us Have been trying to make you comfortable, But nothing is ever good enough for you now, is it? Not nothing. No, Rick. Are you sure about that? Because it sure seems that way... Hey. It's late. Ani, why don't I drive you to your Airbnb and... The only part of my daughter's life I find lacking is you. I'll go check on devina. What have I done to make you think that I'm... I mean, I know you didn't want her to have this baby. I wanted my daughter to have her choices. I didn't want them made for her. Oh, you think that I chose this for her? I certainly think you pressured her. Never have I once pressured her. - Then explain the onions. - The, the onions? Ever since you breezed into her life With your broad chest and your wolf grin, She's changed her mind about everything. - You two barely knew each other. - From the moment we met... Devina and I knew we were meant to be together. Not that you'd know anything about that. Those things, those are very beautiful lies Men like you tell women to get under their skin. And I raised her to know that So that she wouldn't rush in like I, So that she wouldn't have to give up Her hard-fought career. No, Devina's not giving up on anything. it sounds like you don't even Believe that yourself. V? Are you okay? Um... Ahem. I'm, um, not going to be able to do this. Do what? I'll never get this pitch finished. I'm just so tired all the time and, And it's due next week, and I'll never have it done in time. This work should be the least of your worries right now. It's not just work. It's me. It's my story. - There's always next time. - I might not be here. I told you not to look at that. My life is a coin toss right now. So I have to finish this, so she has something. So, so I'll have done something. Maybe this will help. - What's this? - It's a baby book. People fill them with pictures, pregnancy milestones, But maybe you can make something better, Something all for her. I, I didn't know when I married Rick, I'd get the best sister ever. Thank you. I don't know if Rick would agree with you right now. I kind of abandoned him out there with ani. Oh... So did I. - I'd better go and... - hey. You stay here. Rest. I'll make sure ani gets back to her Airbnb And you guys can work it out On the way to the airport tomorrow. That sounds good. Thank you. oh, Maggie? - Yeah? - Could you do me a favor? Please don't tell Rick about me crying. I won't, but maybe you should. - V... - Mm. Come on, baby. Gotta wake up. We have to take your mom to the airport. or we could just, uh, you know, call her a cab. Uh, no. No. I have to... We need to, to apologize for last night. Okay. I'm gonna hop in the shower. Mm-hmm. you okay? Devina? Devina? Devina! Babe. Baby, you okay? Look at me. Look at me. You okay? We can get you another Airbnb if you'd like. This is fine. Look, I wanted to say that I'm sorry. - Where's devina? - Uh... oh, shoot. Stop right there. We just got back from the hospital. I-I only wanted water, mum. Baby, you really shouldn't be bending over like that. I've, I've got this. Really. Y-you really don't. Thank you, ani. I don't need your help with this. I'm just... Let us help you. What is the big deal? I also didn't need you to call my mother And invite her here while I was unconscious. I'm old, dear, but I'm not deaf. What was I supposed to do, hm? Couldn't send her back to London while her Only daughter was being rushed to the hospital. You were supposed to listen to me and to what I need. Devina, you're being really stubborn right now. Just go. I'm gonna make you some tea. Ah, mum, I don't want tea! Ooh. I haven't heard that sound since, uh, middle school. What was it? You wanted to go to science camp? Yeah. And you outlined all the reasons I was gonna hate going. And how did that turn out? Well, you were right. I hated every minute. So 22 years later and, uh, I told you so? So, so you're not upset at me for not telling you? Oh, I'm upset, I'm furious, actually, But I don't think that's gonna help you very much. And as much as I hate to admit it, I agree with Rick. What you're doing, rushing around, Working through the night when you know that you're... That's what you raised me to do, mum. I didn't raise you to work yourself to death. You're my everything. I need you to take off work, rest, And let me take care of you. Mm, mum, I can't ask you to do that. You don't have to. Well, you have to promise To be nicer to Rick, though. We both do. That may be asking too much. don't even worry about it. We'll hold down the fort while you get some rest. And we'll keep you updated. Thanks, guys. Oh! Leo, would you be able to send me, um, a file Of all the princess kay illustrations? of course. I gotta head to a meeting. Bye, V. ah. The stars finally aligned. That's so wonderful! I'm so pleased to see that. Oh, tor. I'll have to call you back. Talk soon? Okay. Bye. What's wrong? Mm. Maggie told me. About the other option. - Right. - Right. And I know you said no... Even if it came down to you and the baby. And I respect that. But nothing is worth losing you. Hey. Not even... And then I feel like a monster for even thinking that. Like I, like I don't even deserve to be a father. No, of course you deserve to be a father. Of course you do. Honestly, I-I'm actually a little envious. This baby, she's gonna have a dad who is gonna be there, Who'll stick around. I'm sorry you didn't have that. You can't be a dad if you're never around. But it's not gonna be like that for my daughter. She's gonna have a real dad. And she's gonna know how much we both love her, No matter what happens. I-I don't even wanna think about that. Okay? But then I can't stop thinking about that. - I can't stop. - Hey. Hey. Do you remember what you said to me that day? I don't know. I was so nervous that you'd say no. Think I blacked out. You said that you knew Everything was happening really fast. It was crazy, but, but you felt ready. You said you knew that it felt right in your gut, That we felt right, us, from the start. Yeah, I did. The funny thing is, uh, I wasn't really as sure as you. What? I knew I loved you very much. I just... I didn't know you were the one, not that day. Okay, so why did you even say yes then? Because when you said you felt sure, For some crazy reason, I trusted you more than I trusted myself. More than everything I've been taught about men and marriage. You took the risk out of it, out of all of it. So I said yes to you, To life with you, To making this family with you. And I'm so glad I did, Because all of it, Rick, All this stuff that happens because you're you Has made me so, so happy. So I need you to trust me and my gut When I tell you it's worth the risk. I wish I can be as brave as you are. Being brave doesn't mean you're not nervous or scared. I'm terrified. - Me, too. - I know. - I don't wanna lose you. - I know. So why don't we live a little? - Yeah. Sounds good. - Yeah. It's okay. Take your time. You can do it. That's my girl. - devina. - Hm? Don't overwork yourself, okay? - I won't, mum. I promise. - Okay. princess kay, her father the king And her elephant Indra lived happily In their coastal kingdom...

Are you with her? It looks like the best course of action Is to intubate the patient. Yeah, um, they're saying that they need to intubate. - no! - What? Tell them not to intubate. My sister says not to intubate. He shouldn't be in here. Sir, I know... Look, my sister is a nationally-renowned surgeon, And if she says not to intubate, then... She's not the doctor on-duty. Put me on speaker, Rick. Dr. Maggie cronswell here. You cannot intubate my sister-in-law. - Devina! Devina! - She's crashing! - Nurse, get the... - Devina, stay with us. Do, do something.

She's breathing, but we won't know The extent of the damage until... so surgery went well, But we did have some complications. what do you mean? Mr. Cronswell, we don't have the means To keep your wife stabilized. Her best shot is to take a helicopter out. V, you're awake. everything's not well. - Oh. - Do you wanna hold her? She's so small. - Is she going to be okay? - yeah. she'll have to stay in nicu for a little bit. I mean, she came so early and her heart, well, it's... What about her heart? It's standard procedure. I promise. She's strong. Hear that? She's strong. She's so beautiful. She gets that from you. - Rick? - Hm? Oh. Dr. Singh. Uh, any news? Not yet. how much longer does she have to be monitored for? It's a going to be at least a couple more hours. okay. We're still waiting on her blood work And we wanna get the best reading on her heart rate. She looks more like devina every year. Thanks, doc. hm. Why'd you stop reading? Oh, uh, you fell asleep, baby. Why don't you rest up, huh? No, no. Let's, let's finish the story. Okay. princess kay and Indra Finally made it to the thieves' lair. We're gonna need to take the baby back to the nicu. Look, she hasn't been awake long enough for them to bond. - This is different. - Is there something wrong? How about I take a picture of you two and the baby? Oh, no, thank you. I'd rather just enjoy this. Let's just take one shot, in case... Yeah. All right. Smile. - There we go. Beautiful. - Thanks. I'm gonna go ahead and take her. I'll bring her back. - I'll bring her back. - devina! - Ma'am, you can't be in here. - That's my daughter in this bed. I'll be here as long as she is. Ah, and this is... - Karlie. - She looks like a Karlie to me. She has your eyes, devina. All right, let's let mom and baby Karlie get some rest. I'll bring her back once you're feeling better. Okay. - Follow her. - What? Make sure the baby isn't lost or switched. - That's-that's a thing? - That's not a thing. Do you ever watch the news? I'll be right back. I was hoping to speak to Mrs. Cronswell about her status. Please do. it's no use, doc. Stubbornness runs in the family. I'm feeling a bit better and a little tired. I am, um, having some trouble catching my breath. That's why we're concerned that we really can't help you here. - W-what do you mean? - What do you mean? We don't have the staff or the equipment To properly stabilize you. We need to move her to westside memorial asap. To be honest, it's a wonder you're even conscious right now. O-okay. So Karlie and I will move to westside memorial. Karlie has to stay here until we fix her heart. She's nowhere near stable enough to fly. What? What? Her, her heart? And fly? If you sign these papers, we'll get you On a helicopter within the hour. I'm not leaving my baby here. I-I haven't even breastfed her yet. - Just, devina, just calm down. - Mum. Don't tell me to calm down, mum. This is my, my child. If we don't transfer you, you might not... Don't you even use those words. I'll get her to sign. As long as the sister-in-law knows I tried. Yeah. It's, uh... Don't worry. Mum... Now that you're a parent... I'll tell you the secret. Nothing goes as planned, no matter how much you plan it. You really wanted this baby. - More than anything, mum. - Oh, sweetheart. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I didn't want it to be true. I, I thought I could protect you. You didn't know I'd be this sick. Oh. Well, I don't want that for you either, But I thought I could protect you From the helplessness of being a mother. The terror of your heart living outside your body... With a mind of its own, Making decisions that scare you to death. Oh, mum. When your father left, I didn't know if I was strong enough. it was so very hard. But I wanted you to have a better life than mine. And you're right. Rick isn't your dad. And you aren't me. You trust yourself. And the people that surround you Make you so much stronger. So I need you to trust these nice doctors And sign these papers. Oh, so that you can be there for Karlie... And... Be a better mom than I am. Don't think that's possible, mum. Well, I've been wrong before, but... I don't think I am this time. Come on. I'm right here, baby. I'm right here. Rick, I love you. I love you, okay? - I'm gonna be right here. - This is as far as you can go. Okay. Okay. I love you. Please make sure they take good care of Karlie. They will. They will, I promise.

I'm looking for a devina cronswell. - sir, just a moment. - Rick. - What happened? - She's in here. I'll, I'll explain it. - Just try to stay calm. - Explain what? Oh, my god. It's a medically-induced coma To help her body heal, stabilize. She-she was just awake and talking. Devina, devina was just here. She still is, despite her odds. We need to call ani so she can come. - Maybe you could go get her? - Mag, I can't leave her. - what about Karlie? - I can't leave devina, Maggie. Okay? Now, not now. I'll call ani. I didn't mean to wake you. No, it's, uh, it's fine. How's Karlie? That nice nurse said that, uh, The procedure went well. She's getting stronger. Good. That's good. I am so, so sorry. The last thing I wanted to do was lose her. - We're not losing her. - You sound so sure. taking a page Out of my daughter's book. If you believe in something or someone, Everything becomes possible. And I believe in you two... In your family. So don't you give up on her. She wouldn't give up on you. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me. me, too. the princess was exhausted, But Indra reminded the princes That her people were counting on her.
