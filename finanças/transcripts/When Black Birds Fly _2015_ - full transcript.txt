Hi, my name's Marius, what's yours? Eden“. Well...Whatcha' looking at? The wall... Don't ya wonder what's behind it? The evil one and all her lies dwell behind that wall... Our lord Caine built the wall to keep her out forever You see... Caine and the Evil One were once a team They built and founded heaven together But our humble lord Cainejust couldn't tolerate her deceitful ways any more... She wanted to use and exploit us! So Caine did what he had to do! He did it for us! He cast her out that filth! So that we may live here in peace! Let us all thank Caine! Look at you little guy! You look like you've made a full recovery Marius! Come here son! Ok son, put him down Look at him fly! You see son, all life in heaven is equal One creature is not more important than the other we're all alive, and therefore, we're all loved by God! And God's love is unconditional! So if you see one of God's creatures in danger, it's your duty to help it! Then, some day, it might help you back! Do you understand what I mean Marius? Well Gee-wilkers Mr. Dentine Are you sure it's safe to be carrying this child so close to the wall while holding a sign that says "I Don't Love You Caine"? Sometimes you just gotta walk on the wild side lil'johnny Caine ain't the boss of me! I'm my own man... In fact, I'm thinking of maybe even eating meat on fridays and slappin' my wife in the mouth!

Well Marius and Eden, how nice of you to join us! Sorry Mr Apple I'm not as good as you are and I never will be. Mr Apple, I was just wondering can animals... talk? Just take your seat now!

Are you sure it's such a good idea to go on the other side of the wall Eden?

Where did the hole go? it was just right there... It closed to you, well for now anyway Once the fruit wears off you'll be allowed back inside What do we do until then? Let's go for a walk! Let me show you around the world! What's in there? Come on, I'll introduce you! Hello... What are you doing out here? I'm trying to find my way back into the garden... How did you end up getting here? Along time ago... God was a misfit... He chose to keep to himself and he lived alone in the universe he created beautiful, radiant stars, circled by tiny rocks made of twigs and water... But they were all vacant, and without any life... He was lonely, he wanted to create something new He played with them non-stop having every kind of adventure you can imagine Then when he exhausted all possible outcomes He came to the conclusion that the creatures he created were less than him... He could never learn from them only teach them and for that reason, he could never fully love them God wanted something new He wanted to create pure beauty and find, love... She had curves... and an opening instead of protrusion She was delicate and sweet all you hate to do was gaze upon her once and for the rest of your life she would be the one that emerges from the darkness Whenever you closed your eyes... Oh she was more beautiful than God, and now he knew what it felt like to fall in love. But he wasn't the only one who fell in love.. And they loved me more than they loved him.. God learned something he never knew about before... HEARTBREAK! And from heartbreak grew jealousy... and from jealousy came anger... and finally to hatred! When god learned how to hate, he saw that the very fabric of love could easily be broken... He didn't like the way it made him feel... He began to destroy things! And I lost sight of where he was... I was alone and scared... I loved god... but in order to be together everything else must be destroyed I am without him... and now... I AM NOTHING I wandered the universe alone Searching, and searching... and never finding anything... (painful screaming) What am I doing wrong? No! What am I doing wrong? I didn't look at the creature the way that god looked at me I wasn't upset that it wasn't as smart as me I felt honored to teach it a companion that will be with me forever and always looked up to me because I came before it I discovered love I became infatuated with them The way they moved... the way they looked... the things they did... The noises they made... But... I made some... mistakes... and after each mistake... they became more terrified of me... until all of sudden. They forgot who I was... and they wanted nothing more to do with me... God doesn't love me... he doesn't love me... and they don't understand me... lam alone again... Do you know what make you kids more comfortable? Peeling that synthetic misrepresentation of flesh off of your soul... Watch, and do what I do! Oohhh! that feels so much better! I can feel the pulsating sound of every single solitary beam of light... penetrating every dripping opening on my soul... sending shivering shivering bits of life up and down the jelly in my back... Don't struggle little guy, you'll get it stuck in the zipper... You don't want to get your soul stuck in a zipper! OUCH! What the fuck are you doing out of your house after curfew? I'm very disappointed in you son! How many times have I told you not to accidentally fall out of your window in the middle of the night and get into some late night romantic adventure with the girl down the street that involves you outrunning the OSWA evil prevention squad! There was an attack by the Evil One's minions a little while ago! Don't you know we're at an evil alert level magenta blue green circle square star? Thank you boys so much for bringing our pride and joy home! You could have woke the neighbors up! his lawn is already greener than mine! This is all I need! He was the runt of the litter the Messanger warned us he'd be little bit off, would you like a cookie dear? It's ok ma'am, he's a good boy just keep him away from the windows until he learns how to sleep a little bit better Oh you bet we will! Son, no windows for a month! No, that's not fair, alright how about a week? We can board them up together like father and son! We better get going, keep that little shit under control! If I ever catch him near the wall again, I will be forced to use excessive brutal force ya hear me? Of course, thanks again officers, here I'll see you out Oh Marius I'm so happy you're home! I love you so much! Are you.. ok mom? Just fine dear! Now let's get you ready for bed... Are you sure? I'm sure that it's the middle of the night and it's way past your bedtime mister! No, no, no I mean about... Hey! You're not disobeying your mother are you? Get to bed young man! You have a long day of nailing your windows shut tomorrow! But dad! Move it buster! Remind him that you love him... I love you son! Tell him that he's special... You're a special boy Marius! You think I was too hard on him? No you're a great father! Where am Awww, hush now my little baby sit still. It will all be over soon... What happened? You've fallen out of the graces of your superiors my dear Who are you? Whoever you want me to be... He'll? me! Don't be afraid of them! They are refilling your veins with new blood! Mmmmm, do you hear that sound? That's how you know it's still alive... mmmm it tastes like dreams!! Your life is meaningless You'rejust a slave race to a creature that had it's back turned during your birth This pretty little face you're wearing, it's just a fancy bag To hold all the liquids in... Once you're ego is disassembled you simply find a new bag to wrap your liquids in you must decide your next form go deep inside and summon the beast within you're nothing more than an animal with a broken leg limping your way through life one pathetic step at a time Your friend escaped here with hidden knowledge You must find him and you must kill him... The others won't see you as you really are Now you'rejust like me an animal... Well howdy there strangers, welcome to Caine's worship kiddie round up ranch! Say I don't know about ya'll but I feel like singing a song! How 'bout it lolipop? Would you like to sing a song for the kids? Lolipop? Lolipop where are ya? I'm over here Uncle T! Overwhere?

What is it? ls Caine gonna tell us something again? Aw, I think so Uncle T, it's a dead baby bird EW!! Oh that's terrible! But you know something, I think Caine can speak to us through that little dead bird, you wanna know why? -vvwhhhyyy? Because Caine knows every time a little tiny baby bird dies and falls to the ground But he leaves it there to show us how much he loves us and how much the Evil One hates us! Oh I hate that Evil One Uncle T! You see Marius? You see what happens when you leave the house? - We all do Iolipop! hey watch out! Don't let those ants bite! Caine provided us with those ants so they can eat the dead things and we won't have to look at their ugly corpses all over the place! - Oh I would have to trip over my dead sinning grandpa on the way to church! Exactly Lolipop! So you see Caine thought of everything! What happened? Norma? NORMA! Norma what are you doing? Marius don't look! Why, What's going on dad?? Don't look cover your eyes! -Please Daryll! Please help me! Dad why aren't we helping Mom? What's going on?? You don't understand Marius... couples... they don't see each other without their clothes on What? Why? it's one of the rules, GEEZ! What are they teaching you in those schools..

Hey relax, no big deal! maybe they just forgot, I mean they forgot to teach your son about the thing with the naked ladies! Your wife is in the other room giving birth to something rather fierce You should really get in there and help her. But bird... I can't get in there while her... squidlypie is out! I'm sure that under the circumstances you'd be forgiven for your trespasses Can you just maybe go in there and make sure the Evil One isn't in there?

What are you talking about? - Please good sir, you've always helped us birds in the past! What is it? It's a surprise! What do I do? Go into the kitchen, get yourself a knife! A great big sharp shiney one! How about one of those new ones you ordered the other day from that magazine? Oh yes, the one that had that really neat video where they cut the tin cans in half! Well now what do I do? Aw yeah, take it into the living room, take off all your clothes You don't want to get her sticky juices on them, now do you? After all, cleanliness is next to godliness, you want to look back when God comes back, don't you? Eh? Lay down next to her and hold her in your arms, yes! Don't worry sweetie, the talking bird says it's going to be ok! Comfy isn't it? Go on now, don't be bashful! Rub against her a little, at least a bit until you feel the tingling, that's God's way of rewarding you for a life well lived! That's love Daryl! That's love! yes! This feels... kinda nice... Oh yes I bet it does! Why My good sir it even looks as though you are glowing! Not a shy one I see! She's like putty in your hands! Now you've got her wrapped around your little finger! She trusts you completely! You can raise that knife up and make an opening for that abomination to rip it's way into this world! Oh yes! rip it out! Rip it out! Quick don't let it escape, chase after it! I love you Norma! I'll be back soon I promise! Quick! Go now, chasey chasey! Cut them all in half! Gut them like pigs! ha ha ha! Kill them! Kill them!

Kill them! kill them all! Kill them! kill them all! You again? Where are your parents boy? Please lord! Please descend from the sky on your diamond studded chariot Pulled by four white horses that can fly with angel wings of their own! Please lord! Please come down from the sky and take me back with you! Oh my lord, is that you? Have you come for me? Have come back? Is the waiting over? Ma'am we found your son wandering the streets muttering something about his mother walking around with no cloths on in the privacy of her own home which is an offense punishable by exile, is this true? I met god tonight... Fucking hell... -!Sir the boy's mother has an exit wound between her legs, how should we proceed? Right, citizen Norma, due to high treason your right to exist in this world has been revoked prepare to be evacuated! You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when skies are gray You never know dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away Didn't I tell ya? I told ya! yeah who is the motherfucking man? I'm the motherfucking man! oh yeah! who's the man? Who is the man? The man, is Caine! It's Caine! Go Caine! It's Caine! Go Caine! Uummm h-hello? How could you? This world I provided for you isn't enough? You still had to go crawling back to her I-I don't understand... No matter what I do... No matter what I give you You all still end up loving her more, I just don't understand I just wanted to help the hurt kitty, I was trying to do the right thing... You have brought lies into heaven! But I understand Marius, more than you think. I understand the allure she can have But do you know what? She will turn on you Marius She will guide you down the wrong path, and then she will turn on you You know since you have come in here you haven't praised me once How am I supposed to know that you love me? Didn't mean for any of this to happen, I'm sorry! Aaannnnnddd? And, I uh, think you're.. much... you're much...uhh Prettier... P-p-rettier... than- You must never speak her name outloud! Saying her name is like admitting she exists, it feeds into her ego! Show me, how you pray! Are you going to stop fucking lying to me? Are you? Tell me the Truth! What do you want to know? I'll tell you anything! Tell me what her voice sounds like... Did she comfort you? What did she say about me? I don't know dude! Something about worms, and these lights Bitch was crazy! You actually spoke to her? You actually spoke to her? You ate her fucking fruit? That doesn't surprise me! You know there was once a time when she loved me, and as hard as I try to keep her out a part of me always wishes she would try to break back the fuck in She's like the ghost of girl that's still alive I am haunted by her, and I love her, as much as I hate her ...and there she was... The most beautiful creature I had ever seen a tall slender girl with long strawberry blonde hair and lips that only knew how to speak my name. I knew that every moment of my time here, must be spent only with her... Hey there... I never felt anyone who feels like you do Your skin, your lips You my dear, are perfect oohhh! I love the sounds that come out of your mouth! I could just lay here and talk to you all night long I feel so safe with you! Like nothing bad could everhappen! Why are the others afraid of me? Well that's because you're different, they don't understand you the way that I do. The fruit, maybe that's the -answer! Can you help me get the others to eat it? How can you say no to those eyes? Oh your beauty! Nothing compares to your beauty, in anything in the universe! Thank you! Yes! You're too kind! Thank you! I don't like it when the other ones eat your fruit... What do you mean? It just doesn't make me feel very good That's no fair to every one else, it would be selfish not to share! And suddenly I don't feel so special anymore I don't mean to cause alarm, but I can't stop thinking about you I'm glad I finally got you alone I need you. I can't get your very image from inside my brain Such wonderess curves, those luscious lips with your forests of long tangly orange hair and that piercing way that you look deep inside my eyes! It's as if you can see all the way into my soul! You just drive me insane! You bring something out of me! You give me this weird tickling itch but no matter how hard I scratch I just can't sooth it! It's becoming swollen, please just touch it for me! Please! What? Get off of me! I'll do anything for you! I would slice apart the tallest mountain behead the beast of your choosing! I would even walk on water if it prevented you from drowning Now how about we get to know each other a little better! Stop! Stop it! Oh! Please! Stop it! What's that? One by one they all found their way to the top of the hill that day Partaking in every pleasure that this place had to offer. Binging and purging all at once She just opens up her legs and she radiates a brand new set of colors that nobodies ever known before Then you fall in love with her when you realize that the others only project the colors that you have already seen! God?! is that you? Is it really you? And that was the day the sky opened up and God created death It rained down from the heavens in a fiery load of passion and filth! Those who chose to sacrifice their virginal beauty to their whore Goddess were stripped of their identities and forced to remain on their scorched planet as carcoal stained doves She claimed that she was more beautiful than God But death was more beautiful than her and as his last piece of revenge, god decided that she would never be-allowed to die No! What have you done? Damn you! DAMN YOU! I hope you enjoy living in this pit alone for the rest of eternity. I am going to erase you From this moment on you do not exist to me Now leave me alone! But I wasn't the only one left alive A lot of us had survived and we had all seen that thing in the sky together We knew who it was, and that someday it would be back for us Until then we must worship, respect, and most of all we must fear it But we didn't all see eye to eye Some believed that her! Fruit had a lot of good to offer That much could be learned from it We reached an agreement. Those that wanted to live a pure god loving life came with me The rest chose to remain in the forest like animals, constantly blinded by the color of her lies Caine? Caine? Caine? Are you There? Caine? Can you hear me? Hello? What for fucks sake?! I am trying to tell a story down here! Sorry sir, but we found the boys father He was just seen scaling the wall and he was.. naked.. and carrying something Well fan-fucking-tastic! Just what I need! And on top of it all I lost my fucking place in the fucking story! -Sorry sir! Go over the wall and get him! Uh... are you.. are you sure? You heard me! Put on your little helmet and climb into the big boy seat of that great big fucking tank I got you and wipe him off the face of this planet! You got that you dumb fuck? -Sir, yes sir! Where am I? You're waking up out of your dream Where's that breathing coming from? Your lungs Daryl Where's Marius? Where's Norma? Don't worry about them! They're both fine! Probably gathered around the telly watching their loolo on the evening news helping out his bird friends! Wonderful human interest story, don't ya think? There seem to be a lot of animals out here tonight, don't you think? Just ignore them and keep moving! Why are they watching me? Because they hate you and they want to taste your stringy flesh! I don't like the way it's eyes are looking at me! Just shut up will ya, you're too stupid for this conversation! Just keep moving! -!I want to be it's friend! But I don't know how to communicate with it Why did he do this? Why would he put all of us in the same place and not let us talk to each other? Look you disgustings waste of flesh the only way I can get out of here is through God's door but I need him to open it first. Now you're either going to help me do that or my friends are going to hold you down and I'm going to peck the fucking eyes out of your big stupid skull Do you understand what I'm saying or should I cleverly word it into a sitcom script so that your feeble little brain can process it easier? I don't feel so good... everything looks so weird! Do you think you're the first man to travel down this path ofelightenment? Do you think you're something special If you were rotting on the side of the road I wouldn't even stop to eat your face meat Shut up! shut up! Stop talking to me! Shut up! shut up! Stop it! Leave me alone! Why don't you just kill them Daryl? Kill them! Draw a weapon fromyour side and slaughter them one by one Kill them daryl! KILL THEM DARYL! Kill them, and eat them! Chew the meat off their boned Taste their souls! Stop it! Get out of here! Just leave me alone! Leave me alone!! Daryl stop crying! Daryl, Daryl stop crying! Calm down. Don't cry Daryl! I just want to talk to the animals... like we're equal! Come on Daryl, we're here! Come on Daryl, get up, we're here! Now you can talk to any animal you want I promise, just open your eyes! Ok, Ok... What are you? Place that beast on the altar What?! I said place the creature on the altar! Tell me who you are We are the remains on an ancient people who chose the path of the life giver instead of the sky monster what do you want from me?? You hold in your hands the only creature to ever be born from a virgin skin In her eyes it's the most beautiful thing ever created That's why I want you to rip its guts out and dangle them in front of her fucking face! NEVER! She must be punished, for what she's done! Every second must be lived in agony, just like us! There's no way out! It's best you just do what she says Just be happy you met her before the other one! Otherwise you might have ended up like me I said kill itl! Come on Daryl do it! Plunge that blade straight through its heart! It killed your wife, remember? What do you care, it's not of your seed anyway Look at it's eyes! They're so bright... full of life There's a soul in there! Shut your fucking mouth and do what I say!! Almighty Caine, please open the sky so that I may receive your light... Please open your heart so that I may receive your love! What are you doing?? Please open your home that I will never be alone! You shut up right now! For I love you the almighty Caine! Stop saying that! And should I ever find myself lost in the shadow of the beast then grant me the ability to see through the darkness and find your path again! I said shut up! SHUTTHE FUCK UP! Almighty Caine, please open the sky so that I may receive your light... Please open your heart so that I may receive your love! STOP SAYING THAT! Please open your home that -I will never be alone! For I love you the almighty Caine! And should I ever find myself lost in the shadow of the beast I SAID KILL FOR ME! Then grant me the ability to see through the darkness and find your path again!! What the fuck are you doing?? Sir, you told us to go after the boys father! I didn't say knock down the fucking wall while you were doing it! Are you out of your fucking mind?? No sir, sorry sir, you're right sir, I am scum sir! Come on now you stupid bunny fuck! YOU! FUCKING! BUNNY! RABBIT! FUCK! What kind of bunny has blue eyes you fucking aryan piece of shit! FUCK YOU BUNNY! FUCK YOU BUNNY! BUNNNNNYYYY! Give me your hand! COME ON! COME ON! I'll pull you up! Don't be afraid! Caine is here! I warned you not to go behind that wall! Hail Caine! Hail Caine! Hail Caine! Hail Caine! Hail Caine! Hail Caine! It always happens the same way I create them, they forget me, rediscover me, and fall in love Then they destroy each other That's the problem with pure beauty. No two people will ever see it the same. They will fight over the color of your eyes, ignoring your words completely. Every now and then one of them will wonder back into the cave usually by accident or through a series of misguided dreams As soon as they discover me they try to worm their way back inside of me but I won't let them! and it drives them crazy and that's how I learned the truth... He wasn't waiting for me up there with opened arms he didn't want me back. He wanted me to stay bound so I couldn't float towards him ever again I will lay here with my eyes closed tightly drifting in and out of consciousness Where I will dream of laying beside him, as he whispers forgiveness in my ear praying that this world he created for me, will still be here, when I wake up...
