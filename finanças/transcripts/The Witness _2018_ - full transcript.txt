The following movie is appropriate for ages 15 and older Subtitles by OnDemandKorea Lee Sung-min Kim Sang-ho Jin Kyung & Kwak Si-yang I'll fill up $30 worth of gas. The Witness My child was hit by a car here! If my child was hit by a car, the bumper... What I'm saying is...! It makes sense if it hit my child's legs first and then her eyes! How could it hit her eyes first and then her legs? Even if my child's too young to be able to speak up for herself, how could they only listen to the driver and...! Thank you. No problem. What was I saying? They told me my child might become blind. You know my So-yeon. How could the driver put my daughter in that state and get off with just a fine? I heard that you're experienced in this area. This needs to be re-investigated, right? It's only right that a re-investigation opens up and he gets punished, right? She insists that she has faith that the police will do the right thing. But how can you trust the police? I told her it's better to just settle. Why? You said it yourself that the police's report seems fishy. It's troublesome to stir things like that up. Nothing good will come out of it. Please stop saying useless things to people! My head's already about to explode with my work load. Why are you butting into other people's business? Well, she's not just anybody. I feel bad for her. Bbi-bbi, come here! I asked Mr. Kang to look into the matter. You did? Good job! What about Eun-ji? I'm feeding her. She said she won't go to sleep until you come home so hurry home. I'm going to be a little late tonight. Again? Why? Everybody knows that we bought an apartment. I need to have a drink with my friends today. If I don't, they might barge into our house. Oh, my! You must be insane! I had a deadline last night so I stayed up all night. You can't bring them home no matter what, okay? And don't become a mess after drinking! Okay. And don't stop people from leaving either. Seoul Restaurant Oh, Mr. Han! Today's star! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! If you bought a house, you should've told us! I didn't buy it. You know it's all bank loans. Cheers. Cheers! I'm telling you my house is fine! Let's have just one more drink at my house! Goodbye! Let's go. Goodbye! Hey! Hey! Are you just going to leave? You know how my neighborhood is, right? You can see the mountain from my apartment! When I whistle, the magpie...! I'm sorry but I don't like magpies. They're so unsentimental. I guess I scared you. I'm sorry. I was in a hurry. I live on the sixth floor. I moved in yesterday. Please don't get scared when we run into each next time. It's because I heard a scream. A scream? You didn't hear someone scream? It was a woman's scream. I'm not sure. Thank you. Don't mention it. Neighbors should help out at times like this and say hello. Someone, please help me! Were you sleeping? Let me just take my shoes off. Did you miss daddy? Somebody, please help me! What's going on? What are you doing? Turn on the lights. Hurry up and go to sleep. You're a mess whenever you get drunk. Why aren't you singing? Sleep on the sofa. Don't come in. Wash up before you go to sleep. Checking front door Please don't kill me... The hospital... Please take me to the hospital... Why are you being so troublesome? Honey. Honey? Honey! Jeez! Hey! Did you dance with the baseball bat or something? What are you doing? You didn't even change! Aren't you going to work? Aren't you? What's that? Oh, my! Honey! Let's go check it out. Don't go. Why? No good will come out from being part of that. But the police is there though... Your day's going to be ruined if you see something like that in the morning. Why did this happen right after we moved in? Jeez. Make sure you pick up Eun-ji when she's done with kindergarten. I'm always doing that. Make sure you lock the door. Jeez, okay! Just go already! Excuse me! Excuse me! He's causing trouble when the neighborhood's already in an uproar. His name's Cola. He lives on the fourth floor. He's mentally underdeveloped. He's doing that to help his grandmother. You get some money if you bring that to the junk man. Jeez, he's such a handful! Jeez, even so, he scared me! My heart! What's with him? You're the new resident on the sixth floor, right? I'll make sure to bring your mail before you come home. Okay. Yes. Jae-yeob. They said there were no calls made. I heard that was on. Everybody must've been asleep because it was late. So? Should I start asking around? We should. Why are you dressed like that when you're a cop? It's pretty. You only care about your looks. We only found CCTVs in the apartment parking lot. So we asked the local police to check the CCTVs located near the roads at the front and back gates, which we believe could have been his escape route. I heard the victim doesn't even live in that apartment complex. Yes. His method of killing was brutal and it seems like he wasn't after money either. What kind of psycho kills a woman in the middle of an apartment complex? There must've been witnesses. Ask around and find a witness first. They said there are no witnesses. What are you talking about? What about everybody living in that apartment? How could there be no witnesses? I know, right? I'm going to need more help. It's a big apartment. Fine. Anyways, this is an apartment complex. If things get too noisy, the residents will start panicking. So do your best to not make trouble, okay? Yes, sir! Especially you! Jeez. The victim died in an open apartment complex courtyard, in front of many homes. But the police still have been unable to pinpoint the exact time of the crime. And other than the fact the Ms. Yoon wasn't a resident, they have no other clues. Therefore, they decided to conduct an open investigation for this case. Goodness. Why are you so jumpy? I reviewed what you asked me to look into. Let's briefly talk later. Okay. A scream? Yes. I'm not sure. I think I may have heard a scream. But the stray cats that come here cry a lot. So I'm not sure. Even I heard it, I would've just assumed it was a couple's fight. Everybody just minds his or her own business these days. People pretend they didn't hear or see anything even if they did. Everybody's like that. Goodbye. Everybody who lives here are highly educated. I'm sure if someone witnessed something, he or she would've reported it. Everybody in this neighborhood upholds the law. I see. By the way, you're not supposed to take this out, right? I'll put it back soon. It's close by. Okay. Yes. You're calling from the prosecutor's office but you need my bank account number? But I heard the call came from the bank. No, no. I'll check it out later. You know what? This is the police station! Hello? Hello? Crazy fool. What happened? It seems like they're learning Korean as a group now! He even sounds like someone from Seoul! Why were you so respectful to him? He knows my number and address too. What if I swear at him and he decides to get revenge? I read all of this. I feel bad for the child. So what did you tell her? I told her to settle for now. But she wants a re-investigation. Hey, come on. You know better than that. Once a report is filed like this, the police will be reluctant to re-investigate. I know but... I feel bad for the child but the best thing is to not get into an accident in the first place. You're making sure the door's locked, right? Yes, yes! Of course! A person died near our house. What about Eun-ji? I'm on my way to pick her up right now. Hey, it's late! You said she ends at 3. My friends told me to buy them lunch since I bought a house so I'm running late. Are you out of your mind? How could you eat lunch all day? It was just for today! Jeez. What about Eun-ji? You said her kindergarten is in an isolated location. Is she alone right now? Her teacher said she'll stay with her for a little. Jeez, what's wrong with you? Yeo Soo-Jin: Happy now? You heard a scream? Yes, around early morning. Around what time? Around 2 am? And? I went to the living room. Because I was curious where it was coming from. Did you see anything? I was about to look outside the veranda. Yes? But the light suddenly turned off. Who did? Who turned off the light? The living room light. My mom turned it off. Ye-seul! What are you doing here? Aren't you going to the academy? Hello, ma'am. We're the police. - It's about the recent murder case... - We don't know anything about it. 2 a.m.? Let's go. How have you been? I'm home. Goodness. Your husband's home. Anyways, you understood what I said, right? Yes, yes. - Please sign it. - Yes, yes. I need to go next door too. Goodbye. You two resemble each other. - Goodbye. - Goodbye! Goodbye! What was that about? She's the chair of the apartment residents' union. She asked me to sign something. Why would she ask you for your signature? What is this? Our apartment has decided not to cooperate with the police for this case... What is this? The lady who died wasn't a resident of this apartment complex. The chair said the police could quietly investigate this case. She said no good will come out from making a fuss about this She's not wrong. Jeez, this is unbelievable. She didn't say a word when we suggested doing construction work to prevent landslides. I know, right? If it rains a lot, that's going to be disastrous! Mister. Go sign it. You do it. She said the owner has to sign it. What is this? How could she suggest we don't cooperate when a person died? How is this different from letting a person die? What if the house prices drop? We just managed to buy one. Are you going to take responsibility if prices drop? Stop complaining and sign it. From now on, murderers should come to our apartment and kill people. Jeez, you've become the defender of justice. Then if you saw the murderer, would you report it? Of course, I would. Even if the murderer saw your face? Give me food. Anonymous tip to the police Hello. I'm a witness who witnessed the... I'm a resident who witnessed... Hello. I'm a witness who witnessed the crime I'm sorry that I can only anonymously report what I saw That crazy bastard. Why did he have to kill in my neighborhood? There's definitely evidence of a chase in the mountain. So? According to the newspaper deliverer, he saw a man run down the mountain around 2 a.m. That coincides with the time the middle school student heard a scream. Based on this, the victim's time of death is 2 a.m. But a call was made to the police around 4 a.m. From the victim's phone. A call? They say the phone got disconnected without a word. Then it may not have been the victim. No, according to the coroner, the victim died around 4 a.m. due to blunt force head trauma. So it's likely that the victim made the call. That means the victim was alive for 2 hours. Then what was the murderer doing during that time? He left and came back. Was there any other call made during that time? Yes, there was none. That's good. Why? There would be an uproar if a call was made and the victim still died. That's good? If somebody called during those 2 hours, a life would've been saved. It's good no one called. How could you say that in front of him, sir? Hey, follow me. Yes. He always twists whatever I say! The victim who was viciously killed in front of an apartment was alive for 2 hours. People were shocked to hear the news. What? Does that mean the murderer left and came back to finish the job? He's a total psycho! Are you okay, honey? Huh? What? Why? You're worried, right? They didn't mention the apartment complex name, right? It means he came back to the scene of the crime to make sure he killed her. Hello? Hello? Who is it? I don't know. It got disconnected. Hello? Hello? Hello? Why aren't they saying anything? Give me that. Hello? Hello...? Oh, my! Our apartment's on the news again. Did you get calls like this before? No. They must've dialed the wrong number. Honey, our apartment's on the news again. What are we going to do? Bbi-bbi. Where's Bbi-bbi? Bbi-bbi? The room... Bbi-bbi! Bbi-bbi! Where are you? Bbi-bbi! Bbi-bbi! Bbi-bbi! Bbi-bbi! Bbi-bbi! Bbi-bbi! Bbi-bbi! Bbi-bbi! Where are you? Bbi-bbi! I talked to nearly all of the residents but none of them had anything to say. I'm sure they don't. What is this? Agreement to not cooperate with police Jeez, these people are being ridiculous. Hey, in this neighborhood... I guess this means nobody in this neighborhood will be willing to help us then. Where are we going, by the way? Fourth floor. Why the fourth floor? There were three people who weren't asleep during that time. How did you figure that out? CCTV. Ms. Choi Seo-yeon? Ms. Choi Seo-yeon? Is anybody home? This is Mr. Han Sang-hoon's residence, right? You don't remember when your husband came home that night? Yes, I was tired so I fell asleep first. Then when did you go to bed? Around 12. I woke up in the middle of the night and my husband was home. Ma'am. May I borrow a pen? I forgot to bring a pen. Agreement not to cooperate with the police Around what time did you say your husband came home? Maybe around 2 a.m.? I'm not sure. 2? 2 a.m.? Do you remember what he was doing after he got home? I don't really remember. I was very sleepy. I went to go drink water. He drank beer. Oh, he turned off the lights. The lights? Who did? Your husband? When he's drunk, he's usually out of it. What are you doing? I wanted to check how well he can see my face. Are you saying my husband saw the murderer? No, no. Just in case. Oh, and... If you think of anything else... Please contact me at this number. Thank you, ma'am. The pen. Oh, right! I'm sorry. She must be your daughter. She looks so pretty. Hi! Please find Bbi-bbi for me. What? She's asking me to look for something. She's talking about our dog that went missing. Let me see that. You're often around this area. Please contact us if you see a dog. Missing dog. The whole family is desperately waiting for her return I understand. I will. Thank you, ma'am. Han Sang-hoon 010-4311-5616 Missing dog Honey. Did you make the Bbi-bbi missing poster? Did someone contact you? How could you give out my name and number like that? How could I not write a contact number? Okay, let's talk when I get home. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry, sir. Why were you so startled? I guess you found your dog. Oh, right. I'm with the police. You're Mr. Hang Sang-hoon, right? Yes. You know someone was murdered 2 days ago, right? I heard you came home around 2 a.m. that night. I was wondering if you saw anything. I was drunk. I didn't really see anything. Oh, right! I heard when your wife came into the living room, you suddenly turned off the lights. Why are you bringing that up? I never did that. I mentioned it because your wife did. Would you please check a photo for me? When a crime occurs, we're required to take photos of the crime scene for a while. You know there are psychos who came back to the scene because they're curious, right? I know. Someone died at your apartment complex so you were curious and you came out to check it out. So when I eliminated the apartment residents and new reporters... He was the one remaining. Have you ever seen him before? I'm sorry. What is it? I'm busy right now. I found that guy in the photo! What did you say? You know the photo in front of the apartment. Thank you, sir. So where are you right now? His name is Park Sang-tae. He's 32 years old. The victim filed a police report that he was stalking her before. Where does he say he was on the night of the crime? He was with her 2 hours before she died. Okay, I'm heading there right now so I'll see you there. Yes, sir! Catch him! Come out! Fourth floor! Stop him there! Everybody's downstairs! What? How could everybody be downstairs? I'm going up now. What happened? Did he go up? He's waiting right now. I got him. I got you, you bastard! Hey, you! Hey! You bastard! Come out! You two, go over there! What are you going to do? Damn it. Hey, hey. Yoon Hee-won Yoon Hee-won Hello? This is Hee-won's number. Hello? Who are you? Hello? Hello? The culprit behind the Gwacheon apartment murder, the bold and horrendous murder that occurred at an apartment complex, committed suicide by ingesting arsenic while he was being chased by the police today. The culprit was dating the victim but when she ended their relationship, he killed her as revenge. Murder at an apartment complex housing hundreds of people, terror within the city What is this? Jeez. Was it Mr. Choo? What do you mean? How could the media already know when we just caught the guy? They're only talking about the most sensational and proactive details too. They just want to add some seasoning while it's still hot. Mr. Choo solved a big, once in a career case at the end of the career. It's not bad if we're included too. It's not bad. But the case isn't solved. Why not? You think a guy who killed someone and left the body in the middle of an apartment... ...would have emotions like this? He's obviously insane! He's reckless. See? What are the chances of finding the murder weapon at the culprit's house? That's not important... What do you think the likelihood is? I'm not sure. Maybe... Sir! We found the weapon! It's 5%, you idiot. Apartment murderer committed suicide while on the run Apartment murder Gwacheon apartment murderer's face revealed It's not him. Who is it? I'm from apartment 405. Pardon? A few days ago, we met in the elevator at night... Oh! Right, right. Please wait a second. Yes, hello! Why did you...? I wanted to ask you something. Yes? Please come in. It's not him. What are you talking about? You saw it that night, right? That's why you staring at your apartment from the crime scene. I don't know what you're talking about. Which night? I don't know what you're talking about. You're getting calls, right? The ones that just hang up when you answer them. Please look, sir! You know it's not him! - Sir! - Why are you doing this? - Sir! Sir! - What are you doing? I saw him. He's still wandering around this neighborhood. You know it too! What do I know? Sir, go with me! Go where? The police station! I'm too scared to go alone. Please go with me, sir! You saw the murder too! What do you mean I saw it? Please let go! If you keep this up, I'm going to call the security guard! - Sir! - Let go! Let go of me! - Sir! - Let go! Let go! Please let go! Let go of me! Please go. Leave. My honey My honey Mister! Sir! Sir! Come on! Dad! Honey, what are you doing over there? Honey, I asked you what you're doing there. Dad! Eun-ji, what's wrong with your dad? Come here! Why? - Oh, my! - Come on! Why? Ow! - Why are you so slow? - Dad! Dad! Honey, what's wrong with you? Jeez! Mr. Han, I guess you're going somewhere with your family. Oh... yes. Yes, yes. You know the murderer was caught, right? Eun-ji. You two should talk. I'm heading in. No, no! Don't go in! Should I come back later? No, no. It's okay! Please don't go. You remember who I should you before, right? Did you see him? What is he talking about, honey? It's not him, right? Right? Please, at least, nod. Or just indicate with your eyes. I don't know. Mr. Han. How many times do I have to tell you that I don't know! I really don't know! I didn't see anything! I heard the culprit was already caught! Why are you annoying me when he's already caught? Why? Eun-ji. Eun-ji, don't cry. What's wrong with you? Why are you yelling? Please stop, detective! He told you he doesn't know! Pardon me. Eun-ji. Eun-ji, it's okay. It's okay. Don't cry. Eun-ji. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Daddy's sorry. We need to talk later. Bbi-bbi? Oh, my! Bbi-bbi! Bbi-bbi! Bbi-bbi! Bbi-bbi! Goodness, where were you all this time? Bbi-bbi! I missed you! Where were you? Bbi-bbi! Based on two prior stalking charges and the fact that he was with the victim 4 hours before her death, he became the prime suspect. And so on the 12th, around 19:00... Why are you guys watching TV instead of working? - Hello, sir! - Congratulations! Ta-da! How pretty! What do you think? Eun-ji. Did you pack everything? Yes. Good job. Missing person Missing person You live on the sixth floor, right? Yes. This is my wife. Please contact me if you see her. Missing person Yes... Yes, did you find something? Yes, there was a stolen car spotted around 1 a.m. Car model? A black Grandeur. Okay. Thank you! Thank you! What are you doing on my computer? Hold on. Why are you doing this? Why didn't you show me this? Come on. It's a closed case. You know who this lady is, right? What about her? It was likely that she saw the murderer. She went missing 3 days ago. Since when did the Crime Division find housewives who ran away? Out of the black Grandeur models that passed by from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m., there was a stolen car, right? You think if you don't properly investigate, the blame will fall on the leader, right? Don't be ridiculous, you fool! The lowest ranking officer will take all the blame, you idiot! Woo-min! Get up, you idiot. I understand what you're saying. But you have to stop putting these up now. Who keeps taking them down? No matter what you put up, you can't do it without permission. Permission? Where do I get permission? You're being ridiculous, sir. Bad things are already happening in the neighborhood. If you put these up, imagine what the people will say about our apartment! What do you mean? What would they about a husband looking for his missing wife? I feel bad for saying this when there are other people present. Your wife left because you did something wrong. So why are you disturbing the peace in the neighborhood? The peace? You said you already filed a missing person's report. Isn't that enough? I understand your situation but... What are you waiting for? Hurry up and take that down, sir! Give it back to him when it's permitted. What are you waiting for? Can't you hear me talking to you? I do. I'm sorry. I have no choice when the other residents are against it. Where do I go to get permission? There's nothing like that. Hold on. What's wrong with everybody? - Give it to me. - Wait! Hold on! - Take it from him. - Why is everybody...? Thank you. What's wrong with you? I guess you don't know any better because you just moved in but... I saw this afternoon that the person who collects paper was only collecting his. Who are you talking about? Don't you know him? His name's Pil-gu. What are you talking about? There he is! That person is Mr. Jo Pil-gu. I heard that you bought him Cola and told him to take them all down. Am I wrong? What are you talking about, lady? If you were the one missing, would you like it if your husband did nothing because he was afraid that the apartment prices might drop? I wouldn't. Let's go, honey. What should we eat for dinner? Do you want me to make you fermented soybean stew? Isn't it strange? Pardon? What is? The guy who set the car on fire did it after he cleaned it up. Hey, say that it's weird if it is! Don't remain upset. Jae-yeob! Navigation! We only need the memory card to come out. Okay! You think this can be recovered? We'll have to see. Hey, where else do we have to go besides this one? For the nearby locations, this is the last one. The remaining locations are the church, subway station, and residential area. What did you say? A residential area? Yes. A residential area? What was the address? 12-1. It's here. 12-1. Go take a look. I think no one's there. Jae-yeob. Look at this. Hey! Leave it alone. Pardon? The location's is strange. Hurry up and look this owner up. Yes. He's here. He's here. It is that bastard. Pardon? The way he went to his house is odd. Should I grab him? No, no. Even if we grab him now, all we have is circumstantial evidence. You can't flip a closed case with just that. Damn it. It would be great if we had a witness right now. It's him, right? We found the real culprit. But we have no one to testify against him. On the night of the crime, the people likely to have seen the culprit are you, Ms. Choi Seo-yeon who lives on the fourth floor... Ms. Choi is missing, right? And there's one more person. Someone named Mr. Jo Pil-gu. Sir! You know the kid who stole my mail last time? Cola? Yes, do you know where he is right now? He went out with his cart earlier so he probably went to the junk man. Here. Thank you. Thank you. It's hot today. Drink this. Why? You don't like Cola? My grandmother likes this more. You're such a good grandchild, Cola! Here. No, no! It's okay. I'm giving you both because you're such a good kid. Take both of them. - All? - Yes. Hey! Cola! I live in apartment 403! 403! I know! I know! I know! Don't you know me? We met at the apartment last time. I live in apartment 606. Oh, 606! I live in apartment 403. Yes, yes. Take this. You should give them to your grandmother. She's waiting for me. Yes, yes. I'm not trying to take these from you. They're yours. Hey, I want to ask you something. Didn't the police come to see you during the past few days? No, they didn't. Why? The police are going to come talk to you. They're going to show you a photo. And they'll ask you if you know him. Yes. You need to say you don't, no matter what. If you say you recognize him, that bastard will kill you. That can't happen. That's why. You saw the bastard, right? What bastard? The one who killed the lady with a hammer at our apartment complex. The one wearing a hat. I know the hat. Yes, the hat! Did you see him too? Yes... I saw him too. You saw him too, right? I did. I saw him too. Yes! Oh, damn it! Why did we have to see him? The hat's here right now. What? The damn hat. He's been here since earlier. Stop, you idiot! I said stop! Let go. Mr. Han, let go. We're the police. The police! Why did you come here, Mr. Han? It's this bastard, right? We have someone tailing him. So if you testify, we can arrest him right away. I don't know him. I don't know him. Damn it! A woman is violently murdered with a hammer in the middle of an apartment complex. And you saw it happen. But because you didn't say anything, that bastard is roaming free! And another woman is missing now! Why is that my fault? That bastard's still roaming free. If I report him, can you protect my family? How could I believe you guys when you made an innocent person the culprit to close the case? That's why you need to testify now! Goddamn it! You know Ms. Choi Seo-yeon who lives in your apartment? She might be alive. Right? You just need to make a decision. Just you. Mr. Han. Detective Jang! Detective Jang! They said Song Tae-ho disappeared. What? Where did Jo Pil-gu go? Cola! Damn it. Cola! Cola! Cola! Cola! Mr. Jo! Cola! Mr. Jo! Cola! Mr. Jo? Mr. Jo? Mr. Jo! Cola! Mr. Jo! He's still alive. Cola! Cola! Wake up! You need to go see your grandmother, remember? Cola! Open your eyes! Central Surgery Center You think I'm a selfish bastard, right? Don't you? All I have is my wife, my daughter... And an apartment I bought with bank loans. This is too difficult for people like us. It's very hard. The downstairs lady who's missing. She's dead. Honey... How...? So all this time, you... Why didn't you tell me before? I'm sorry. I just... ...wanted to protect you. You, Eun-ji. And this house. People say it will pass by soon if you just close your eyes. But... The downstairs lady who died... She said she was going to report it to the police. She asked me to go with her. If I went with her when she asked... If I had... I'll be back. Make sure you lock the door. Come back home safely. Let's go! Let's go! - Hurry up! - Let's go! Hey! Let's go! Go! Get in! - Let's go! - Go! He held a hammer and... ...He was killing her. I... ...was afraid that bastard would come to our house and... Mr. Han agreed to testify. Song Tae-ho's home right now, right? Yes, he's still home. Okay, we're on our way right now. I went downstairs to return her smartphone. During that time... Clear! Clear! Hey, second floor! Second floor! Song Tae-ho! We're arresting you for murder. Get down! It's dangerous! Woo-bin. Woo-bin! Kid! Take care of Woo-bin! Hey, take care of Woo-bin! That asshole! He's getting away! He's getting away! What happened? Where is the bastard? Where is he? How could you not catch him?! What are you? Don't you know what kind of monster he is?! What about me? He will know that I'm the one who told the police about him! How could this happen? What are you going to do now? How are you going to take responsibility? What are you going to do about my family? Honey, I'm heading home right now. Mr. Han! Don't come outside, no matter what! - Make sure you lock the door. - What's wrong? - Did things go sideways? - No, no. Everything's fine. Mr. Han. - Make sure you lock the door. - Mr. Han. Taxi! Taxi! Sir, it's not a right turn. I saw earlier that they're doing construction on that side. Jeez. Sir. - Sir, is there something wrong? - No, no! Mister. Don't you think that black car's tailing us? I'm not sure. Mister! Mister! Are you insane? Do you have a death wish?! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I thought somebody was following me! Jeez! This is ridiculous! Please! Let's hurry up and go! What in the world? Go back! Reverse! I told you to reverse! Reverse! Reverse! Mister! Sir, are you okay? Oh! Are you okay, sir? Sir! Sir! Sir! You bastard! You bastard! You...! Why...? He said if I kill you, he would let my Seo-yeon go. How would I know where Ms. Choi is? He told me that when he took my Seo-yeon... ...you were there too! I heard you saw him take her but turned a blind eye! Did you really do that? You damn bastard! You deserve to die! How could a person...! How could someone do that! Ms. Choi is dead. That's a lie. When I went... ...She was already dead. Lies! Die, you damn bastard! Mr. Han, are you okay? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot him! Don't shoot. Don't shoot. He's Ms. Choi's husband.

But Song Tae-ho was never abused by his parents as a child. - His family wasn't well off but... - There you are. Oh, hello! You're being discharged today, right? Yes, I'm going to go to work starting tomorrow. Have a cup of coffee. What happened to Ms. Choi's husband who lived downstairs? Oh, that case? It was just a car accident. As previously shown, there was no issues with the brain. Then why do we have violent and horrifying... Detective Jang. Why do you think that bastard killed so many people? There's no reason. In my opinion, there is no reason. Similar to how people eat when they're hungry, he killed people because he wanted to kill. We're living in a world with psychos like him. Oh, my! Then you're all better now? Oh, what a relief! Yes. Oh, my! Sir! - Please be careful with that! - I'm sorry! Oh, my! Are you serious? My husband didn't say anything. Yes, yes. See you next time. Yes.

Of course. Why didn't you tell me? Why would I? Eun-ji, your dad's so cool, right? - Yes. - You're awesome. Oh, stop. I guess you're moving on a snowy day. You should've waited a little. Things would've gotten better soon. I'm sad to hear that you're moving away. You just moved in. Yes, I'm sad too. How much did you sell your apartment for? Pardon? It shouldn't be less than $400,000. It's not less than $400,000, right? I can just go ask. You're going to be lucky because you're moving when it's snowing. - Goodbye! - Goodbye. Somebody, please help me! Someone, please help me!
