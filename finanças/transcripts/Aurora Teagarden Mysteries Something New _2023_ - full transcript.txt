Is this where you try to stab me? [laughs] Just help me up. Good job. Professor Lindo? Please continue, Miss Teagarden. Okay. So, the murderer told police that his victim, Barbara Evans, tried to stab him with a pair of scissors while hiding under a desk, and his lawyers claimed self-defense, but who can tell me why that doesn't match up with the facts the author presents in this book? Yes! Great job today. [student] Thank you so much. Well done, Miss Teagarden. You really had them paying attention with that re-enactment. I certainly picked the right person to be my teaching assistant. Well, thanks. I really try to picture the scene when I read true crime, you know, like trying to figure out what really happened is kinda like therapy to me. Hmm. Yeah, that makes sense to me. You know, I am very curious to see what topic you settle on for your master's thesis. You know, your deadline to turn that in to me is next Friday. Well, after reading your book on the Laci Peterson case, and all that stuff about how the prosecutor would test out his theories on Internet message boards, I was thinking something like, "The impact of amateur sleuths on the justice system." Hmm, that's a good start. I know, I need to do more research, but I can't this week, not with starting that new job at the diner, and trying to keep my friend, Sally, sane before her wedding. Speaking of which, I should get going. Uh, burgers or bride? Burgers. Great. Do we have steamed broccoli? Uh, yeah. You must be the new server. I'm Daniel. Oh! Hey, um, I'm Roe. Um, is there some abbreviation I should use? Officially, it's B-R-O-C, but "BR" works, too. After 12 years here, I've got abbreviations for the abbreviations. 12 years. Wow. Yeah, the owner is kinda like a dad to me, and it's a pretty good gig. [dings order bell] [man] Roe Teagarden? Oh! Arthur! Hey! Here, let me help you out here. Um, this is for you. Enjoy. [Arthur] I knew you'd be back in town for Sally's wedding, I just didn't expect to run into you here. I thought you were living in Seattle working on your Master's. Well, I was. I did my first year there, but then I found out that the Library Science program at Lawrenceton U offers a specialization in true-crime literature, so here I am, working two jobs for tuition money. Mondays and Wednesdays as a TA, and then another three days a week here. True Crime, huh? Classic Roe. I remember you carrying around true-crime books in high school, reading them between classes. Still my M.O.. Just finished this one. Assigned reading for the undergrads I teach. "Quest for Justice: The Killing of Barbara Evans." Interesting. -Take it. -Yeah? Yeah, I think you'd like it, and, obviously, you're in the crime-solving business these days. The uniform looks good on you, Arthur. Oh, thanks. I, uh... Yeah, if you're going to be working here, um... you'll be seeing me in it a lot. Yeah, me and my compadres, we like to eat here after our shift is over, so... [order bell dings] I've got food up, but will I see you at Sally's wedding kick-off party? I'll be there. Okay. [whispering] "Compadres..." [Aida] Aurora? Oh, thank goodness you're here. You know, we have to leave for Sally's party in less than an hour, so you-- Honey, um... please don't sit on the couch with those soiled diner clothes. I can smell the grease from here. Yes, Mother. You know, I barely had time to stop at the gym after the office, and then, I had to bring home insurance audits to work on after the party. You brought work home again? Mm-hmm. You know, I took this temp job because I wanted to keep the lights on at the real-estate office, but at this point, I have sold more boat insurance than I have houses. I'm sure that'll turn around soon. Maybe I should just... close the office and admit defeat. Mother, no. You have worked years to start your own agency. You can't just give up on your dream. Yeah, well, I call it being more realistic. [doorbell rings] -Hey, Sally. -Hi. I know we're early, but Matt has some things he needs to do before the party, so... Hey, Aurora. Thanks for giving her a ride today. [Roe] Of course. What else is a Maid of Honor for? See you there? Hello, Aida! Oh, hello, Matt! -See you. -Bye. [Sally] I don't know why I thought throwing a party three days before the wedding was a good idea. [Aida] It was a great idea, Sally. [Sally] Oh, no. I forgot to tell Matt that Aunt Gladys doesn't want to be picked up till 7:30! It's okay, I'll go tell him. Matt? Matt! [car engine starting] Sally, I'm sorry. I couldn't catch Matt. He was gone by the time I got outside. Oh, not to worry, I can go pick up Gladys. I mean, she and I haven't seen each other for a while, so it'll be fun to catch up. Thank you, Aida. I'll send Matt a text. [Aida] Okay. So this is very eye-catching. I mean, really, Sally, your interior-design blog is very impressive. Yeah, you know, Matt could make one of these for your real-estate office. Yeah, maybe. You know, this isn't how I thought I would use my journalism degree, but Matt's been so encouraging, and my email list is growing, so... So you actually finished your degree? Well, not technically. I still have six credits to go. Did I tell you guys? Matt and Carson got a huge offer to buy their company. Wow! For their web-platform thing? Megablog? It's Giggoblog, and, yeah, it's a big money offer that's supposed to go through next week. Oh, congratulations! Thank you. Now, um, I'd better go look for something to wear to the party. You too. [sighs] [chuckles] Wanna see my blog? Over here. Just don't tell my mother I'm sitting on the couch. Deal. I love her, and I am lucky to have a rent-free place to live, but it is not so easy moving back in with your mom after being on your own for eight years. She still treats me like I'm barely out of high school. At my bridal shower, she kept asking me why I was "rushing" to the altar, but then again, a lot of people have been asking me that. Well, I mean, it did happen kinda fast. I mean, that concert where you met was, like, what, seven months ago? Please tell me my Maid of Honor is not a doubter, too? No, no, not a doubter. I am definitely Team Matt. I've never seen you this happy. I am so happy, and you moving home is the cherry on top. All right, show me the wonders of your blog. I just have to ask you, is that what you're going to wear? [groans] Okay, I'm changing. She said it-- Sally, Mother, everyone in this house-- I'm changing! * This heart has waited... * [Sally] Well, what do you think, Roe? Wow, Sally, this place really is quite the venue. When I was little, my Grammy and I used to come here for tea every month. Aw... I knew when I was nine this would be the perfect place to have my wedding. [Roe] Well, it's beautiful, and you did an incredible job decorating. I hope you took lots of pictures for the blog. [Sally] Oh, yeah, Matt already did, and he already uploaded everything. I honestly think he could do anything with the Internet. Yeah, you gotta watch out for my brother. He once hacked into the college website just to prove to the professor that he could. [laughing] Hey, Kara, you want to help me with these? Yeah, I'd love to. -Oops! -Thanks. -I'll take some. -Thank you. I wish there could be a placecard for my mom. She just... she would have loved to see Matt get married. Oh! Your mom died? -I'm so sorry, I had no idea. -Oh, no, no, no... I mean, I know your dad passed when you guys were young, but... Yeah, Matt was only 15 when she passed, but, Sally, I can't tell you how much it means to me that we get to be part of the beautiful Allison clan, and I just love you so much! Oh... -Hey! -Roe! I gotta thank you for lending me that book, the one on the Evans' murder. I'm two chapters in already. It's great. Right? I couldn't put it down. Yeah, no, that lead detective is quite a character. I think that's what I want to do, make my way up to detective. I'm actually already assigned to our homicide detective's detail. Arthur! That's amazing! Oh, I can't wait to hear your stories. [Arthur] Ladies! Lovely to see you both. Hi. There you are, darling girl. You're home. [Arthur] Can I offer you some champagne? -I'd love some. -Yes. Oh, your mother must be over the moon. Are you kidding? Her mother is thrilled. I missed her so much. [Roe] Yes, it's like I never left. Oh... [laughing] Aurora! Hey. I want to introduce you to someone. Maid of honor, the best man. Aurora Teagarden, Carson Hayford. Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. You as well. I'm glad we're finally getting this show on the road. Mm-hmm! Oh, yeah, nothing's going to keep these two from getting together. [chuckles] Mind if I steal Matt for a second? Duty calls. Hi! [Arthur] Well, it's great to see you, it really is. So I keep hearing that Matt and Carson are about to be millionaires? Mm-hmm. Sally's found love and also enviable security. And so quickly. Well, maybe you can find them an enviable home to buy, and quickly. And quickly. [man shouting] Where's Matt Walker? Walker, you owe me, and I'm gonna make sure you pay! [Matt] Take it easy. Take it easy. Hey, can we do something about that? -[Matt] Get off me! -Hey, what's going on? [man] I'm going! [Matt] Nothing's happening, it's all right. I'm coming after you. -Who was that? -I don't know. I've never seen him before. [Roe] What? That doesn't make sense for a stranger to confront you like that? Yeah, and what did he mean he's coming after you? I have no idea. Honestly, that was the weirdest thing that's ever happened to me, aside from that stray dog jumping in my car that one time? He was trying to come home with me. It was probably his owner. [giggling] Yes, it probably was. Everyone's staring. Everyone, attention? If you haven't found a glass of champagne, it's time to pick one up. Thank you. [Roe] To Sally, my best friend and my chosen sister. I remember in freshman English when all the stories you wrote always had some kind of love story in them. [everyone chuckling] So it's pretty surreal to see you live out your own love story now with someone who not only gets you, but also supports your work. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm great. To the bride and groom, and their happily ever after! [everyone repeating] To the bride and groom! [glasses clinking] [chuckling] And I expect a phone call from you if you plan on staying out late, okay? Mother, how about we pretend I'm actually an adult now? Or how about we pretend that you actually like my fussing over you because you know how much I've missed it. Yes, I love you. I love you, too. Have fun. Don't stay out too late. Yeah, yeah. I love you, Mother. Are you kidding? Hey! Who is that woman? I saw her outside my house earlier. That is Matt's ex-girlfriend. Dawn Palmer. She's gone stalker on him. Crashed his bachelor party, and I had to run interference. Does Sally know about her? I don't know. Dawn's a pain, but basically harmless. Matt thinks once he's married, she'll knock it off. Stalking is a crime. Why doesn't he just report her to the police? Not my circus, not my monkeys. I thought you were going to drive me home. I know, I just, I had a little too much to drink, so I... I'm gonna take a cab, sleep it off. I'll call you in the morning? I'm sorry. Okay. Good night, Matt. Hey, how you doing? Matt hasn't been himself all evening. [laughs] Oh, don't worry about it. He always gets a little nervous before big events, and getting married is about as big an event as it gets, so... it's gonna be fine. -Thank you. -Yeah. [woman] Miss Allison, do you have a minute, please? Oh, I... Yeah, no, you go do you. Hey... were you just saying that to make her feel better, or do you actually think there's nothing to be worried about? Maybe a little of both. I'm gonna take off. Hey, Sally! I'll see you at the dress fitting. -[Sally] Bye, Kara. -Love you. Bye. Have a good one. Hi, friend. Do you remember when you'd get super stressed before finals, so we'd have a sleepover, and you'd come over, and we'd study, and then watch a movie? Want to spend the night? There's a new true-crime doc I'm dying to see. True crime? Thank you, but no thank you. Anyways, I'm tired. I'll just see you tomorrow, okay? I'll pick you up at the diner? Yeah. Dress fitting tomorrow. You got it. 'Night, Sally. Good night. What are you doing here? Oh, hey. I'm just meeting a couple of friends. Is that a frittata? I didn't know we had that on the menu. We don't. I just made it for me to eat before we clock in. Want a taste? Sure. Wow. That is delicious. It should be. You're looking at a culinary-school graduate. You're a chef? Then why are you...? Working in a diner? Emilio is the one who paid for my training, so... how ungrateful would I be to go work somewhere else? Okay, so my friend is getting married on Saturday, and I promised I would make her and the other bridesmaid breakfast, but maybe I could bring them here and you could make some of that instead? Yeah! Yeah, I'd love to cook for your friends. Oh, thank you. You just made my day. -Arthur! Hi. -Hey. Kinda early for you to be in here. Ah, just grabbing a quick coffee to go. Hey, uh, did you-- did you think that party was a bit weird last night? You mean with the party crashers, stalkers, and the groom ditching the bride at the end of the night? No, not weird at all. Wait, stalkers? What stalkers? Dawn Palmer, Matt's ex. According to Carson, she's basically harmless. Oh. Hey! What happened? Matt was supposed to call me this morning, and he didn't. He's not answering the phone, and when I went to his condo, he didn't answer when I knocked, and I don't know the door combination this month. It changes every month. And he's not replying to my texts either. [Sally] I'm so worried. Do you think I should file a missing person's report? Can't do that until he's been missing 24 hours, but try not to worry too much. Every year, the department gets one or two missing groom cases. They always turn up, Sal. Yeah, I'm sure Matt's just off working on his vows. Let's go to your dress fitting, and-- I think Kara should just go with me. I want you to try to find Matt. Do you remember when you found my lost cat in 10th grade? Or the time that you found my finals paper for U.S. History? You're really good at finding things, Roe. You always have been. Okay, I'll try. [Arthur] I can help. I don't start my shift for another hour, so... [Kara] Thank you, both of you. Thank you so much. Sally, let's go get you into your beautiful dress. Thank you. [Kara] It's going to be okay. Not sure where to start, though. We should go to Matt's, see if we can get in. How are we going to get in if Sally can't get in? I don't know, but it's worth taking a look, right? [Roe] So, Sally already knocked and called. [Arthur] How do we even know if he's home or not? [Roe] We don't, we're winging it. Now come on. So, Matt's got this combination lock on his door. Sally says he has a bunch of expensive computer equipment, and keys can be copied, so this is more secure, but Sally doesn't even have the code. What's he gonna do after they're married? Still make her knock? We have to get in there. Roe, with or without the code, it's breaking and entering. Let me call in a wellness check, get permission to call a locksmith-- Arthur, what if Matt's in there and needs medical attention? Come on! Kick it in. Breaking and entering is a crime. I could get suspended. Okay, fine, turn around. -You mean-- -Arthur, just-- Turn around, okay? -I think that this is-- -Shh, shh, shh! Okay? No breaking, just entering. Oh, my-- [glass breaking inside] Roe! [banging on door] Roe! Okay, a little breaking. [exhaling] Come in. Don't be worried about it, come on! Yeah. [Roe] There are no signs of Matt in the bedrooms or bathrooms. Wow, look at this set-up. Must take a lot to run a web platform. Matt left his phone. No phone, no car? That can't be good. Maybe there's a text and it'll tell us where he is. What is that? Ceramic? A piece of a mug? Arthur, look. Looks like blood. [Arthur] It definitely could be... There... more drops... ...leading to the balcony. [Roe] I didn't notice this before. We found him. We found Matt. If Matt had too much to drink, maybe he got dizzy, fell off the balcony? Not if those drops on the floor of his condo were blood. Okay, let's turn him over. It's not Matt. [Arthur] Not Matt, but he looks familiar. That's the guy that confronted Matt last night at the party. Did you get a name? No. Matt said he had no idea who he was. Let's hope Mr. Mysterious has some ID on him. Smith, why don't you take Miss Teagarden off my crime scene? Yes, Detective Cook. Let's go, Roe. Hey. It's not Matt. [Sally] Oh, thank god! Wait, so there was a body under Matt's balcony, but it wasn't Matt? No. Then who was it? It was the guy who crashed your party last night, the one who was yelling at Matt. You know who he is? No. Wait, so do we know where Matt is? Um, sorry, I'll be right back. Hey, you're Dawn? You're Dawn Palmer, right? You've been following Matt. Did you follow him home from the party last night? Yes. I knew he'd want to see me, and I was right. He said that he was glad to finally talk to me. Well, did he mention anything else? Did he say he had plans to go somewhere, or--? My conversations with Matt are none of your business. Dawn, look, I just need a couple of answer-- Dawn! Dawn, the police are going to want to talk to you! Dawn! [groans] Do you have any updates? So that was Dawn Palmer, Matt's stalker? She said she spoke to Matt last night. That was Dawn? So he spoke to her last night? What did he say? She wouldn't tell me. She doesn't like to stick around. [Arthur] We'll track her down, but right now, we have a name to go with the body. His driver's license says he's Brody Kresser from Walnut Creek, California. That name ring a bell with any of you? No. And Matt claimed not to know him? What do you mean claimed? If Matt said that he didn't know him, then he didn't know him, okay? Maybe you should give her a ride home, let her catch her breath. Well, could you? Yeah, no, I-- Yeah, Kara can take her home. I mean, I'd like to stick around and see what else you find-- Kara needs to answer a few questions from Detective Cook regarding her brother. Basic background information. -Okay? -Okay. [sighs] Well, I can tell you this... The medical examiner just found a huge gash on the side of Brody Kresser's head... Well, if he fell off that balcony-- ...with a shard of ceramic in it. Ceramic like the one we found inside Matt's condo? Yeah. It's not looking like an accidental fall. It's looking like a homicide. So the blood inside the condo... Matt could be the one who killed him. It would explain why he's missing. He's on the run. [exhales] Someone has to break it to Sally, and I think it'd be better coming from you than Detective Cook. [exhales] Yeah, all right. Wish me luck. Oh... [Roe] Sally, you're not listening to me. This is serious. It's something you need to be prepared for. Right, but I think that you might be overreacting a little bit. -Aida? -What? Will you please tell Roe that studying true crime is warping her mind? She thinks that we can't find Matt because he's involved in killing someone. It's a possibility, one of many the police are considering. But it's absurd. Roe, my Matt? He volunteers at an animal shelter. It is crazy to think that he could kill someone. I have to go call my parents. What in the world is going on? It's been a long day. Let's make some tea, and I'll fill you in. Please. Carson. Just the person we've been wanting to talk to. Hey, what-what's going on? You know Matt's missing, right? What? Well, I know he didn't show up at the shop to pick up the tuxedos that he was supposed to this morning. No. You're telling me he's missing? Neither Sally nor his sister have heard from him since last night. Oh. Do you have any idea where he is? Wh-- No. No... Is that why all the patrol cars are out front? No, those are here because we found a body on the premises. A body? Oh... but it's not Matt. It's the guy he had that altercation with last night. A guy named Brody Kresser. Did you know him? No. No, I'm sure that was... I've never seen him before last night. No, that's crazy. That's awful. So if the body isn't Matt, um, why are you guys searching his place? Shouldn't you be out looking for him? Well, we're hoping to find something that might tell us where he's disappeared to, for one. Right. You really have no ideas on that? No. No, zero ideas. I wish I could help, you know. Um, you know, the computers in there, they don't belong to Matt, they belong to our company. If it's okay with you, I'd like to pack them up and take them with me. Yeah, that's-- that's not going to happen. Right, I understand, but if you are thinking of taking them, I expect to see a warrant specific to Giggoblog property, of course. Well, I don't think Detective Cook was considering that before, but, uh, I'm guessing he will now. Right... Right. Well, um, I'll leave you be, and keep me posted. You bet. See you. Hmm... So it appears Brody Kresser's only address his entire life was his parents' house in Walnut Creek, California. Although it's probably his house now. There's an obituary here for his mother, Alice, from three years ago. She died just one month after her husband was killed in a car accident. Oh, my gosh, how tragic to lose both of your parents so close together. Aurora, please promise me you'll always take care of yourself, and you will stay out of trouble. Mother, do not worry. I do not plan on making a habit out of this sort of thing. That's good. [Sally sighs] Okay, so my parents want me to stay with them until Matt shows up. They promised they'd help me finish setting everything up for the wedding. The wedding? Sally, how are you going to have a wedding without a groom? You heard what Arthur said? Missing grooms always show up. I'm sure that Matt is going to come bursting through the door any second, and explain everything to you. Of course he will. Mm-hmm. All right, well, you call me if you need anything. What if what I need is for you to believe that Matt will show up? I'm so sorry this is happening. Oh. Carson! You've heard from Matt? No. No, I'm here to find out if you have. No, we still don't know where he is. I mean, you're his fiancée. Surely, you must have some idea where he went, some special place he likes to go. Don't you think we'd have looked there if she knew? I'm sorry, you're right. I'm just worried out of my mind. [car horn honks] That's my dad. I gotta go. Okay. Keep me posted? Yeah. -Bye. -Bye. Sorry to bother. Hey, Carson, if you don't mind me asking, how did you and Matt meet? We were in the same web-coding class in college. He was way better than me, so I glommed onto him when it came to team projects. That's where he told me about the idea for a blogging platform, and a business dream was born. So why do you think Brody Kresser confronted him like that? I mean, was it, like, some kind of rivalry? Did they know each other-- You know what, I already had your cop friend grill me about this. I don't know what you're getting at, but I never heard of the guy. If he knew Matt, it wasn't through Giggoblog, okay? Okay. I'll see you. Roe Teagarden, what are you still doing here? Well, I was hoping to do some research, but... Researching your thesis topic? My friend's fiancé, Matt, went missing, and while we were looking for him, we found a body under his balcony. Wait, you found a body? A dead body? The police think it's murder, and I'm afraid Matt may have killed him and taken off, and that's why no one can find him. So, what exactly had you planned to research? Well, I thought I'd start with the victim, maybe look into Matt's company, or... Honestly, I'm not really sure. You're in your second year of library and information science, and you're still not sure where to start? Okay, let's... let's try this. Um... what is the seventh principle of Information Science? Information can be converted to knowledge through the "knowledge instinct". So then, where did your instinct tell you to begin? With the victim. I thought I should learn everything I could about him. Did you know that these computers are connected to all the university databases? Okay, so, now you need a plan of attack. Tell me the eighth principle of information science. That's the one on knowledge ecologies, right? No information stands alone. All information is produced within the context of social relationships, so... I could start with Brody Kresser's family and friends. Thank you for your help. We still haven't located any family for Kresser. His parents are dead, no siblings. I'm working on tracking down an aunt in New England. What about work history? Coming up empty on that, too. He's never been employed that I can tell. Although his parents seemed pretty well-to-do. He inherited their house in Walnut Creek. Sorry. So what's he doing up here? Looking for Matt Walker, apparently. Well, the preliminary search on Walker's condo came up with nothing. Nothing on his cell phone either, no mysterious calls or texts. However, the ceramic shard they found under the coffee table is a match to the shard we found in the wound in Kresser's head, but there's nothing else matching it in the condo. So the killer picked up the pieces? Yeah... and hopefully threw them in a dumpster nearby. It's too bad the condo association was too cheap to spring for security cameras. And how long before we get DNA blood results from the condo? About 10 days, but I think it's pretty clear what happened. Matt Walker lied about knowing Kresser. After the altercation at the party, Kresser shows up at his place, they get into another fight, Walker kills him, and in a panic, throws him off the balcony, then makes himself scarce. Um, but don't we need to establish motive first? Thank you, Smith, I almost forgot. After we get another warrant signed, we'll bring in Walker's computers. I'm sure we'll find the why there. I'm not worried, the evidence is solid. What we really need to do is talk to the woman who was stalking Walker, the one who said she saw him standing at his place last night. Dawn Palmer. Yeah. She's a possible material witness. Find her, bring her to me, and clean up your desk. [clicking] No way. Find something? An archived social-media account belonging to Alice Kresser, Brody's mother. Turns out Matt was lying about not knowing Brody. I just found a photo of them together. So Matt knew the dead guy. And his parents. This was posted five years ago. The caption said it was Brody's father's birthday party. Look, I'm really sorry, but I have to give this to the police. No. Please, you can't do that. Please, you can't. They might think that Matt had something to do with this guy's death, and he did not. There's absolutely no world in which Matt would hurt anybody ever. I hope that's true, for your sake, for Sally's sake. Ever since I saw Dawn yesterday, I've had this terrible feeling that maybe she was so upset about Matt marrying Sally that she did something to him. Like, if she can't have him, then nobody can, and this Brody guy got in the way, or... Hi. He's here for the photo, but you should tell him what you told me about Dawn. If you're talking about Dawn Palmer, we have an APB out on her right now, but until then... ...this is not a good look for your brother. I've always loved the tradition of giving out wedding favors, you know, so your guests have a memento of your special day. Well, I'm glad your divorce didn't sour you on marriage. Oh, no, quite the contrary. I'm a bigger proponent than ever. I took for granted how much marriage grounds you, you know. Everything seems so much more precarious when you go it alone. Do you miss Charles? Every day, but he and I made the logical decision for us, and so I see no reason to be maudlin about it. [door opens and closes] -[Roe] Hey. -Hey. Whatever Sally needs help with, I'm willing to help her. [Sally] I want to be ready for the wedding. The rehearsal dinner is tonight, and I know Matt will be there. I don't want him to think I lost faith in him, 'cause I know that he would never lose faith in me. Um, Sally? Hmm? There's something you need to see. Turns out Matt did know the victim. This will all make sense when he comes back and explains himself. You'll see. If you don't mind, I have to take these to the car. [slow hold music playing over phone] [Detective Cook clearing throat] Uh... what is it? The medical examiner just gave me a preview of Kresser's autopsy results. He's narrowed down the time of death between 10:00 PM and midnight the night of the party. Pretty much what we figured, right? Right. He also said the gash on the victim's head was not fatal. Broke the skin, but not the skull. The cause of death was internal bleeding from injuries sustained during the fall. So, this might not be a homicide after all, not if Kresser fell on his own. Maybe he was pushed. Yeah, maybe. On the bright side, we did find Ms. Palmer. She was at the Cedarbridge Inn, parked in the lot right next to Matt Walker's car, which had been there since the other night. Let's see what she has to say. You were seen outside Matt Walker's condo the other night. -We've been looking for-- -I don't know what you mean. We have a witness who-- We have a witness who said she spoke to you, and you told her you followed Matt home from his wedding kick-off party. Well, she was lying. I wasn't there. [Detective Cook] Miss Palmer, you're the one that's lying, and I'd like to know why. Because it's none of your business if I saw Matt or didn't see him. I would never reveal anything that he told me in confidence, not to you, not to anyone. [Cook] This is not a game. This is a murder investigation, and if you're withholding information-- I'll never betray Matt. Never. Well, then, Miss Palmer, you can just sit here and think about what it's going to feel like when we charge you with accessory to murder. [chair banging] I'm thirsty. You have a soda machine around here? Really? You know, I am impressed that you haven't given up on your search. You know, 'cause information science prescribes that you stay on the same track until you're sure you've exhausted it, which... can be exhausting. Well, I went into the court-system database for Walnut Creek, and look, Brody Kresser's parents filed for bankruptcy just weeks before Brody's father's car crash. That's an intriguing find. A strange find, because I also found an archived social media post from Brody Kresser's mother where she talks about her husband quitting a Silicon Valley job for, quote, a new venture. Here, I'll show you. I-I don't understand. Her account is gone. It was here, like, 20 minutes ago. How could it be deleted? Um, well, someone with override access in the archive? I do know someone who can supposedly do anything on the Internet. [groans] I knew it. "Matt, I gave him the cash, and he swears he won't ask for more." What? [yelps] Oh! [stamping] [man grunts] Aurora? Matt? I'm sorry. I... I thought you were Dawn, okay? She's the only one I thought would be crazy enough to break in here. What is wrong with you? Do you know how worried Sally's been? I didn't mean to worry her. I just had some things I had to take care of, and I didn't have my phone. I'm guessing you left it behind so the police couldn't use cell phone towers to ping you and track you down. What are you talking about? Are you calling Sally? Shh! Hey! Arthur? Yeah, I, um, I found Matt. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm at his condo. Okay. Okay, thanks. I'm supposed to inform you that you need to wait here for Detective Cook and Arthur to arrive. Why would I leave? I get married tomorrow. Really? That's why you came back? For your wedding? Yes. Not to get to your computer and delete that email I just saw on your screen? Matt, I found a photo of you and Brody together at his father's birthday party. I gave a copy to the police, and I showed Sally. You showed Sally? Of course I did. Now I'm calling Sally. She deserves to know where you've been. Your sister, too. [Arthur] You jumped the balcony again? Yeah, and when I got in there, Matt was deleting stuff off his computer. How'd you even get in there? I read a manual on how to pick a lock this morning. Of course. Sorry. Aurora. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where is he? Where's... Oh, thank goodness, you're okay. I'm sorry, Sally. Are you guys arresting him? We're just taking him in to answer some questions. Roe, if you get any more ideas about this case, call me first. They're just going to question him, right? Um... yeah. You're free to go. Matt! I had nothing to do with that. You had an altercation with this guy just hours before this happened to him. You lied about knowing him. You disappeared after his murder, left your fiancée and friends and family in the dark. I think you had everything to do with this. Look, I know how bad this looks, but I... I don't think I should answer any more questions until I've spoken to a lawyer. If you're not charging me with anything... You want to have formal charges? Fine. Let's see what the D.A. has to say. Sally deserves better. I know she does... but I do love her. Yeah, I understand. Well? The D.A. won't support formal charges against Walker. Says we don't have enough. But the victim's blood is in the condo. It's solid evidence. Circumstantial. The hit on the head didn't kill him, the fall off the balcony did. We have no evidence that Walker pushed him, there's no DNA on Kresser's clothing, nothing under his fingernails. We can't even place Walker at the condo at the time of death. We got no security footage, no taxi receipts. We got nothing. Well, if we could get Dawn to talk to us, she could place him at the condo. Good luck with that. For now, we got to cut Walker loose, but I want you to tail him. No more disappearing suspects. You got it. [Arthur] Like Cook told you, do not under any circumstances leave town. Hi. [Kara] Welcome back, little brother. Uh, it's almost time for the wedding rehearsal. We should head straight to the church. [Roe] Um, I'm sorry. You've been gone for days, we found a body under your balcony, and you want to go on as if nothing has happened? I had nothing to do with Brody Kresser's death, but if you're asking if I still want to marry Sally, the answer is yes, of course I do. Sally, is that what you want? For all of us to go to the rehearsal? Just-just... ride to the church with me, okay? I'll explain everything. Roe and Kara have been helping me keep it together for two days. They deserve an explanation as well. You're right... they do... ...but not here. [Sally] Okay. [Roe] Why don't we start with why you lied about knowing Brody that night at the party? [Matt] I didn't lie. I didn't realize it was him until after he left. The son of a friend I was close to once. John Kresser. John was a guest speaker in one of my computer science classes. He became sort of a mentor to me. I only met Brody once at a party. I barely spoke to the guy. John was the one I was actually friends with... until I came up with the idea for Giggoblog. He didn't think it was a very good idea, gave it some pretty heavy criticism. I didn't take it well, said some things I regret, and we weren't friends after that. Brody was yelling at you that you owed him. What did he think you owe him? [Matt] An apology, I guess. The apology I should have gave John. He, um... died in that car accident before I had the chance. Matt, that's awful. I'm so sorry. What happened with Brody at the party really threw me, so I took a cab to a bar downtown. Dawn Palmer said she followed you home to your condo that night. She said she spoke with you. Dawn... Dawn will say anything. That didn't happen. I didn't get home until the middle of the night. Some guy from the bar dropped me off. A guy? What was his name? I don't know, Fred something. Fred Baskin, or Haskins. When I got home, I was still in my head, so I went for a walk. I ended up at that motel, the Great 8, near the mall. I didn't have my phone, I didn't have my car. I just sat in that room thinking. Thinking about the Kresser thing, about us. Worrying I wasn't good enough for you. So you sat in the room for two days and never called me? That first morning, I turned on the TV, and I saw the news. Brody Kresser's body found outside my building? I got scared. I didn't know what to do. This morning, I shook it off. I walked home and I-- And used your web skills to find Alice Kresser's archived social-media account and delete it. Okay, yes, I deleted some things. I remembered seeing that picture of me and Brody, and I was worried that it wasn't going to look good, and guess what? I was right, but I swear I didn't do anything to him. Sally... I'm so sorry. I'm an idiot. I should have never put you through that, but this whole thing, it taught me one thing. I love you, like crazy, and I still want to marry you and prove for the rest of my life that I deserve you. Okay. Why don't we just go to the wedding rehearsal, and we can talk about it later? Okay? Yeah. See, I told you he'd have an explanation. Matt must have told Sally some story to explain himself. Oh, yeah, he had quite the story all right. Wouldn't be surprised if every word of it was a lie. Well, Cook wants me tailing him, so maybe we'll know something soon. Is this wedding really still on? I guess so. We don't have a lot of time to prove who did this-- No, not "we." You don't have to prove anything. Detective Cook and the Lawrenceton Police Department have to prove it. Fine, then you all need to prove this by 5:00 p.m. tomorrow, or we might have to watch our friend marry a murderer. Good point. Cook! Smith. What are you doing here? I thought I put you on Walker. I got Timms to tail him. I thought you'd want to hear the story Walker told his fiancée. Did you? Yeah, so he was drinking at a bar with some guy who dropped him at his condo before he walked to the Great 8 Motel. Did he spit out a name for the ride, or did he just call him "some guy"? Uh, he said the guy's name was Fred Baskin or maybe Haskins. So Walker gets dropped off at his condo, and then for some reason, heads over to the Great 8 Motel? Yeah. Huh. Okay, so at least Walker admits to being at his condo that night. Maybe he did cross paths with Brody Kresser. We gotta find this Fred guy. He's a witness that places Walker at the crime scene. You find him, I'll head over to the Great 8 Motel, make sure that he actually stayed there. Maybe he left over some evidence, perhaps a shard of ceramic. Looks like the case against Walker's coming together. You should smile, Smith. Aurora, hey. -[gasps] -I didn't mean to scare you. Just... did that rehearsal dinner feel like some weird alternate reality or what? Uh, yeah. I mean, it was a little strange that they're going on as if nothing has happened, but-- I'm curious what he said to Sally to make her forget that he went missing for two days. Uh, I don't know, something about wrestling with self-doubt in a motel room. Did he say anything else? Anything about Brody Kresser? Just that he knew his father. Did he say how he knew him? He said he was like some kind of mentor, and they had a falling out over you guys starting the blog platform. What? That... Wait, is he going around saying that I knew this John Kresser? Did he tell the police that? I don't know anything about him. I don't know what Matt's got himself into, but that's on him. He's not dragging me down with him. I've got to make some calls. Good night. What? [bar blues music playing] Bartender's out back signing for a delivery. You a regular here? What's it to you? I'm looking for a guy who might have been here two nights ago. Were you here Wednesday night? I'll say it again, what's it to you? The guy I'm looking for, his name's Fred Baskin, or maybe Fred Haskins. He supposedly hung out with this guy, and they closed the place down. Matty! Matty the Saddy. That's what I called him. Crying in his beer. Dude owes me 50 bucks. Wait, you're Fred-- Haskins. Can I get you a beer? Sure. [Aida calling] Aurora! Aurora, Arthur's here! [knocking on door] Hey. Do you mind if I, uh-- Wow, pretty retro. No judging. I haven't had time to redecorate. I'm trying to organize everything I know about the Kresser case. I thought we agreed you weren't going to get involved in this case, or put yourself in danger anymore. Arthur, how is me writing things down in my own bedroom getting involved? It's just me writing things down. Now, tell me everything you know that I don't. Hmm? Okay, I know this, Cook confirmed Matt did stay at the Great 8 Motel for two days. I found this Fred Haskins Matt told you about. He was there that night drinking with Matt, from 9:30 until they shut the place down. Haskins then gave Matt a ride home at 2:30 a.m., way past Brody Kresser's estimated time of death. So it seems Matt does have an alibi. Okay. So... So good. So Sally's not about to marry a murderer. Wait, where did this photo come from? The same party this photo was taken-- John Kresser's birthday four years ago. That's John. Caption said that guy's name is Albert Paulson. It didn't say who that guy is. I know who he is. I just talked to him for an hour. That's Fred Haskins. Matt and Haskins didn't meet at the bar. They knew each other through John Kresser. So Matt's alibi is fake. [groans] We are right back where we started. Arthur, what am I supposed to do? I'm supposed to meet Sally and Kara in the morning, and I'm not sure I'm expected to just waltz down the aisle when Sally is probably going to marry a murderer... ...or if it's not him, it's his best man, who was very paranoid about John Kresser's death. Oh, really? Then there's creepy Dawn who just keeps showing up everywhere. I mean, if we can't prove who this is before the wedding, it's going to feel like a bomb is sitting under the church. First off, we'll have a tail on Matt the whole day. That means Carson will be under surveillance, too. That's great, but wouldn't solving the case be better? -Roe! -Let me help. Come on, think about it. You wouldn't know that Matt faked his alibi if I hadn't found that photo. Hmm? [chuckles] Fine, but promise me that if you come up with any leads, you won't go chasing after them on your own. Fine, I promise. Okay. You know... life was starting to seem nice and predictable, even a bit boring... ...then you came back to town. You're welcome. [chuckles] Okay, Albert Paulson, let's find out who you are. It's cold today. I'm glad it's not an outdoor wedding. You're a little early, aren't you? Well, I didn't want you to have to do all the work. I thought I could help chop or stir or something. Ah, don't worry about it. I'm making a prosciutto quiche with spinach and feta cheese. Wow. That sounds incredible. I really didn't mean for you to go through that much trouble. It's your best friend's wedding. Plus, I'm a sucker for romance. Hmm. I don't have time for romance. Between writing a thesis and having two jobs, I have no time to date. You're going to a wedding tonight. Feels like a perfect occasion for a date. Are you trying to get me to bring you as my date? Is it working? Maybe. [cell phone ringing] Oh, um... Hi, this is Roe Teagarden. Is this Albert Paulson? As if he'd be here on a Saturday! No, I'm his paralegal. I screen emails from our contact inbox. You said you're researching a story about John Kresser? So to speak. I know that John Kresser and your boss were very close friends. Like brothers. Ah, such a sweetheart. I don't think I'll ever get over him dying like he did. So sad, and so weird and out of nowhere. Um, are you saying that John Kresser's death was suspicious? He dies in an accident three days before he was about to file his lawsuit? Why the police chose not to investigate it, I'll never know. Wait, wait, John Kresser was going to file a lawsuit? [giggling] [Sally] Hey, Roe! It's your wedding day! I'm so nervous. Okay, so I had this dream last night that I put on my wedding dress, and it turned black. Do you think that's a bad omen? I hope you're hungry, 'cause my friend, Daniel, is making us a feast. Oh, I forgot. I have to grab my bridesmaids' presents out of my car-- That's okay, I'll go grab them. You are the best. Oh, you know what, why don't you take this? It's really cold. Keys are in the pocket. Presents are in the trunk. -Thank you! -[cell phone ringing] Okay. Oh! Look at all this! Arthur, hey. Please tell me you have the evidence you need to make an arrest today. [Arthur] Not yet, but I found a report for the crash that killed John Kresser. His car broke through the guard rail, went off into a ravine. Also, I spoke with Carson this morning, asked him about that and about Haskins. He didn't respond well. Refused to talk to us without his lawyer present. Then there's Dawn. What about her? Well, Cook has me tailing her today, and she has decided to tail Sally. She's outside the diner you guys are having breakfast at right now, sitting in her car in the parking lot. If she makes a move on the diner, I'll arrest her for harassment. Good to know Officer Smith is on the job. You getting out of here? Oh, no, I'll be right back! Oh, don't let me forget. After breakfast, I have to tell you about a lawsuit John Kresser was about to file before he died. I convinced his lawyer's paralegal to fax me over a draft copy. I'll call you after. A lawsuit? After breakfast. [engine revving, tires skidding] [Arthur's voice echoing] Roe! [tires skidding] Roe! Roe! Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm okay. Are you okay? -Yeah. Roe, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You okay? Are you okay? I want you to get out of the vehicle, slowly raise your hands. There you go. Are you carrying a weapon? You may have just helped catch a killer. I wasn't trying to get her. I thought it was Sally. I had to stop her from trying to marry my Matt! [Sally] You were almost killed because she thought you were me. Sally, I'm okay. [Arthur] You sure you're okay, Roe? Yeah. Just cold. Here, you can borrow this. No, it's okay, Arthur, really. Thank you. Of course. [Arthur] I told you getting involved in this case was trouble. Arthur, I was just getting presents out of the car. [Kara] But clearly, Dawn is violent and not as harmless as Matt thought. I mean, she must be the one who killed Brody, right? Maybe she thought she was protecting him? It's a possibility, but we're still investigating. How am I supposed to get married when my best friend was nearly run over? [Arthur] Postponing the wedding until we find out who killed Kresser might not be a bad idea, Sal. Yeah, I mean, maybe just for a week or two? Maybe that's what's best. [Kara] What are you guys talking about? How is that what's best? Dawn wanted to stop the wedding, and now you're going to let her have her way? You're right. I'm not going to let Dawn take mine and Matt's happiness. [sniffles] Let's go back inside. Okay? I gotta say thanks for pulling Roe out of the way of that car. I wasn't sure if I was about to watch her... Anyway, uh, Roe, I'll let you know what happens with Dawn, and then I'd like to see that lawsuit. [Daniel] I'd say that guy's into you. Arthur? No, for as long as we've been friends? Hey, you want to keep him in the friend zone, I'm not gonna argue. I've got to get that quiche out of the oven. [Dawn] Oh, my god, you're totally overreacting. Yeah, I tried to hit Sally, but I wasn't trying to kill her. I just wanted to maybe break her leg a little bit so she couldn't walk down the aisle. You think I'm crazy. Well, I'm not. Sally isn't the goody-two-shoes that you think. She somehow tricked Matt into marrying her, when I know that I'm the one that he really loves. Okay, so you tried to break Sally's legs to help Matt. Did you try breaking Brody Kresser's head to help Matt, too? Brody who? Is this your handiwork? Did you attack this man in Matt's condo, then push him off the balcony? No, I did not do that. [Arthur] But you were at his condo that night, the night of the party? You told my friend that you saw Matt. What time did you see him there? If I saw Matt, I wouldn't tell you. I will never betray Matt. Never. Oh! I'm just going to place this on the bridal table. Oh, Sally did such a fantastic job decorating. Ah, yes, she's quite talented. I have a friend who is, uh, interested in selling her home, and I recommended you as a listing agent. She's expecting eight figures and is very particular. Well, thank you for the recommendation, Gladys, but you know, my office hasn't been very productive lately, so maybe after I get a few more listings, I could call her-- I told her that you were a very skilled woman with rare gumption, and you'd be very enthusiastic about helping her out. Was I mistaken? No. I... I just may have mislaid my gumption lately. Well, I suggest that you find it before you give her a call. I've got her card right here. -Thank you. -Yeah. Morning, Aida. Aunt Gladys. -Hello. -Hi! Just dropping off the champagne. Splendid. Matthew! Carson. Where you been, buddy? You're ducking your best-man duties. What's with this text you sent me? You grabbing screenshots of our emails? I want that flash drive-- Shh! I told you, I'm not gonna use it. I just wanted some insurance to make sure you don't do to me what you did to John. Look, I will give you the drive after the sale goes through, and I get my half of the money. You don't want to play that game with me, especially not when Sally's cop friend is asking me about Fred Haskins. Haskins, Matt! You pulled him into this? You're an idiot. [Matt] Why? Because I don't want to take the blame for something I didn't do? Always playing innocent, but I know better. There's no way I'm going to let you use Haskins to set me up to take the fall for what you did. Matt, is everything okay? Uh... yeah, yeah, everything's great. We're just a little on edge about the big event. -Weddings. -Yeah. You know what, there's another box outside. I'm gonna go grab it. Okay. [cell phone ringing] Hey, Arthur. I'm just on my way to meet Sally and Kara. What's up? Well, despite Dawn Palmer trying to run down her ex's bride, she didn't kill Brody Kresser. In fact, she was nowhere near Matt's condo building that night. Her father showed us proof that she was with him, and the restaurant they were at confirmed. Well, I guess that's good for her, but bad for Sally. I mean, that means Matt is still most likely the one who did it. Maybe, maybe not. We just got access to security footage taken from the Cedarbridge Inn the night of the party. And? Well, it seems Carson confronted Brody after they left, and it clearly got physical. I don't know. Something's missing. So why don't you tell me what's in that lawsuit you've been talking about? Well, I don't really know what's in it yet. I mean, I had it faxed to the only place I know with a fax machine-- my professor's office, but look, I'm supposed to meet Sally and Kara at the salon, but I'll go pick up the lawsuit document and call you back from there? Sounds good. [groans] [sighs] You look beautiful, Sally. I just... Oh, I needed to try it on one last time. With everything that's happened, I was just really nervous. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, it's going to be okay. Okay? I promise personally. Let me get your veil and my bubbles. [laughing] We have so much to do before the ceremony. I love you. -Love you. -See you soon. Hey. Carson! [giggling] I'm sorry to do this, Sally, I really am-- Okay, Sally, I really need to talk to you! Roe, your hair, why haven't you-- Okay, forget about my hair, there is something really important I need to tell you-- What you both need to do is stop talking and listen to me. [Carson] No need to fall apart on me, Sally. I'm not going to hurt you. I just need to get Matt's attention, and get him to hand me a flash drive that he's using to threaten me. Why would Matt want to threaten you? You're his best friend. Well, that may have been true once, but not anymore. That's what happens when you commit crimes together. What? What crimes? Well, first, Matt and Carson stole the idea for Giggoblog from Brody Kresser's father. No. No. Giggoblog was Matt's idea, and mine. We came up with it. But John Kresser wrote the code for it. Okay, yeah. Matt's first pass at writing the code didn't work well. John revised it, added a few things, but then he got greedy. Demanded half a stake in the company, when I was the one who wrote the business plan, found the investors. We did months of work. He writes code for a week and wants half? No... No way. [Roe] Is that really what you believe? This is a draft of the lawsuit that John Kresser was going to file against Giggoblog. He did expect a 50% share. He was promised it when he did more than 90% of the platform's code. There's a list of exhibits in here that support his claim. Is this true? Did you and Matt steal someone else's work? There's also a copy of an affidavit signed by Fred Haskins who claimed he wrote some of the code, but Fred Haskins doesn't write code. He's a licensed plumber, currently unemployed. Unless, of course, you count providing fake alibis and evidence as employment. Okay, all right, all right, that's enough, Aurora. I mean it. Either you stop talking about stuff you don't know about, or-- Or what? You're gonna hire Haskins to run me off the road the same way you hired him to do to John Kresser? Roe, what are you saying? John was conveniently killed in a car crash three days before this lawsuit was supposed to be filed, and I saw Matt deleting an email between him and Carson saying someone had been paid, and wouldn't be asking for more. Carson, is that email on the flash drive you want? The proof that you and Matt paid to have someone killed? Sally, call Matt, tell him to get himself here and hand me that flash drive if he ever wants to see you again. Do it now! Okay... Hey, you know what? I'll do it. Hey, Matt, it's Roe. Yeah, I know, just, uh, listen carefully, okay? Carson has taken Sally and me hostage at the Cedarbridge Inn. He has a gun. He wants the flash drive-- Tell him no police, or Sally dies. He heard you. He understands. Please hurry. It's okay, all right? Help is on the way. Matt's on the way. Good. I'll get my flash drive, and I'll be on my way. [Roe] You really think the police are just going to let you walk? Carson, you paid for a murder. Probably two. Oh, I did not kill Brody Kresser. No, that... that's all Matt. That's not true! He would never... I didn't think he had it in him either, but what do you know, when push came to shove, Matt got it together and shoved John's greedy kid off his balcony. [rattling door handle] [chuckling] Um... hey, Sally? I think somehow the door locked. [knocking] Hey, Sally? Um... hey, Kara! Uh, Sally's fine. She's just got, um... pre-wedding jitters. Um, why don't you go across to the church, and you can be ready to help her when we get there? [Kara] Uh, no, um... the bridesmaids aren't supposed to leave the bride. I think I'll just, uh, I'll just wait out here. Carson... ...you actually believe Matt killed Brody. You're not just saying that to throw the blame off yourself. Well, how could I do it? With the combination on that lock on his door, I have no way to get in. Him and his stupid system of changing the combinations... Wait, he has a system? Based on what? Stuff from before we met. Childhood pets, dogs, cats, lizards, whatever... The point is we all know Kresser was hit on the head inside the condo, hmm? And Matt is the only person who can get in, so put two and two together. He did it. No, Matt is a gentle soul! Love is blind. Speaking of, where is Matt? Huh? Where is he? Call him again. I need to talk to him this time. Sally, no. Trust me, okay? -Hey! -Kara, where's Sally? In there. -Back up, back up. -What's going on, Matt? [knocking urgently] Sally, hey! Hey, it's me. Matt, be careful! We're gonna go out that door... ...and he's going to hand me the flash drive. You hear that, Matty? Yeah. Yeah, I heard you. I have the drive. [Carson] Open the door. Sally, it's going to be okay. Carson, come on, she has nothing to do with this. Give me the drive. Sorry, Sally. [sobbing] [Carson] Now... you're gonna let me through the front door, so I can get outta here, then you can have your little wedding. Carson, whatever it is you're trying to do, you need to stop-- Stop talking, Kara! Stop it right now. Hey, hey, hey, look. Look at me. I should have never made the drive, okay? When Haskins called me, he said that you had already contacted him. How was I supposed to know I wasn't next? Shut up and let me get out of here! Drop it, Carson! Let her go. Hey, come here, come here. You're okay, you're okay, you're okay, you're okay... [sobbing] Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you choose not to have one, one will be appointed to you. [Arthur] Nice ruse, calling me when he thought you were calling Matt. This reminds me of the end of that true-crime book you gave me on the Evans' case. The wrong guy arrested, and it was a whole year before the new detective on the case realized the pieces didn't add up. The floor where the murder happened was locked tight. Do you remember how the detective figured out who the real killer had to be? He realized the janitor was only the one with the keys to that floor. Exactly. The one with the keys did it, or in this case, the one with the combinations did it. Arthur, I don't think Carson killed Brody Kresser. So it was Matt after all then. Maybe, but I don't know, it doesn't feel right. It seems like we're missing something. Well, if it wasn't Matt, Carson or Dawn, who killed Brody Kresser? [Cook] Smith! Get over here. [Arthur's voice echoing] Who killed Brody Kresser? [Roe's voice echoing] I don't know, it doesn't feel right. It seems like we're missing something. [Prof. Lindo's voice echoing] Tell me the Eighth Principle of Information Science. [Roe] No information stands alone. All information exists in the context of... ...existing relationships. Kara! Kara, what are you doing? Matt told the police it was Carson, and Carson's going to tell the police it was Matt. It was not Matt. No, it wasn't. It was you. The night of the party, you were concerned about Matt. You went to his condo to wait for him to come home, but he didn't. Instead, an angry Brody Kresser did, and he found you, Matt's protective older sister, and the only other person in the world who knows the names of the childhood pets that Matt uses to reset the combination lock on his door. Kara, look around. You can't run from this. He was threatening to ruin Matt's life. So you hit him on the head with a vase, but it didn't knock him out, did it? He chased you onto the balcony, and somehow, you managed to push him over the edge. You picked up the pieces and locked the door behind you. My mom made me swear on her deathbed that I would protect my little brother, and that is the only reason that I did this. How was letting suspicion fall on Matt protecting him? I would never have let him be arrested. There was just so little evidence, I thought this would all blow over, and... I thought he'd marry Sally, and then... [crying] he'd finally get the family that he deserved. She's gonna leave him after all this. It's all ruined. I ruined everything. [sobbing] Hey... Would you think I'm crazy if I said I still wanted to get married today? [chuckling] I still have the tux. Look, whatever Carson told you I did, it was all him. I didn't do anything wrong, except stay quiet. [sighs] But I am not that man anymore. You... you made me a better person. So please, just... just give me one more chance. Matt... my faith in you stretched farther than I ever could've imagined, but... it won't stretch any more. I'm sorry. [police officer] Well, I guess take her into custody and then we'll see what happens. I'm going to have to take her to the station. What's going on? I'm sorry. It was Kara. [Matt calling] Kara! No. [chuckling ruefully] I'm not getting married today, Roe. I know. But hey, you won't have a sister-in-law who's a murderer. Too soon? Okay, sorry. [laughing] [knocking] Ta-dah! My thesis topic. Hmm... "How the Knowledge of True-crime Literature Can Help Law Enforcement Secure Justice." Huh, okay. Well, you got my attention. Now come sit down and take me through your approach. Okay, so here's what I'm thinking... I'm glad you learned to listen to your instincts, Sally. Better a bad announcement, than a bad marriage. Thank you, Aida. I'm going to go call a potential new real-estate client, see if she'll list her house with me. I've heard she's very particular. Then you will be her ideal agent, Mother. Aw... How lucky am I to have such a cheerleader? You are. -Bye-bye. -Bye. Daniel said he made this special for you. That will go a long way in curing what ails me, and so will never, ever mentioning Matt's name again. I cannot believe I was hours away from marrying a criminal. Promise me it will never, ever, ever come up. Promise. I promise. You promise. Oh, be right back. Hey. -Hey. -Arthur. Any news? Well, charges have been filed against Kara for the murder of Brody Kresser, and both Matt and Carson have agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to murder his father. Thought I'd let Sally know. Ooh, um, she actually just made me promise that we would never bring up Matt's name, like, ever again, so maybe she doesn't want to know. Yeah, fair. Oh, I almost forgot. Thank you for the loan. Of course. So... you and the cook, you guys, uh... dating, or...? I mean, I wouldn't say we're dating. I mean, we're going on a date tonight. Although, um... he has this crazy idea that you want to date me? Oh, uh... I mean, for as long as we've been friends? How weird would that be? [laughing awkwardly] Yeah, so weird. Yeah... Yeah. Anyways, I should, uh, say a quick hi to Sally. Ah, I think I'm okay... All right, scoot in. It's my break, and I always read on my break-- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. -We said no more true crime! -What! I did not agree to that. What's this one about? After everything that's happened? Oh, it's so good, Arthur, you're going to love it. Okay, so this woman, she goes missing in Portland, Oregon, she's found in Washington State a month later.
