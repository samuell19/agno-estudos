That's why I don't go out anymore, the night scares me. That night left a permanent scar on my mind. I still have nightmares. I am so sorry I asked about it earlier. No worries. But that's it, that's the story of how the Killer Unicorn was born. That's probably everyone. Right. Girl, what is going on? Yeah we had to, like, run over here. It was not cutie. Shut up y'all. Hey baby. We need to talk. Looks like somebody's got a new puppy. - Hey guys. - Hi Pup. What do you need? I need to show you something and it is not pretty.

Of course I did. He woke up to the severed head of a very loud drag queen. She was a very loud queen. Oh my God do you think that that's why the killer shoved something down her throat? It's because he wanted her to shut up? - Guys! I figured it out! It's the guy that was seen with Jess the night she died, with the unicorn mask. How? Well, I was talking to some guy on Grindr and his profile picture was that of a unicorn, and then last night when we were coming home we got attacked by a guy in a unicorn mask. What? And then this morning he texted me telling me he had a gift for me in my closet. Okay, I see where this is going but let's leave the recap for the late seaters, what are we gonna do now? We need to get in contact with everyone who was there And every body else, Lady Havokk wasn't with us, but he is obviously after the rest of us. The killer said he was going to the party tonight, so we're gonna go and use me as bait so we can get him. Wait, so you're going to the party? There has to be a better way. No! He's not going to stop until he gets me. I don't like this. Well bitch, get ready because I am going in a look. Okay, then what do we do? Well, he killed our sisters, it's just fair we kill him too.
