Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. All aged people line up on one side. Hey! Hey, get up. Come here. Look, skinny guy. All the newbies, stand here. Move forward! If any of you newbies are carrying cigarettes, hand it over now. Okay, sir. I'll inform them. - How many new ones? Only one. A murder case. Come on! Walk fast! Come! Sign here. Name? - Pennindi Balram Naidu. Father's name? - Somu Naidu. Name? - Bata Somasekhar. Father's name? - Venkata Subbaiah. Name? - Landa Nagaraju, sir. Father's name? - Yaddaiah, sir. Name? - Bellampelli Srinu. Father's name? - Ramanamurthy. Name? Hey, I'm asking you. Tell me. - Eluru Soori Babu. Father's name? - Eluru Narsayya. What's your name, bro? In what case did you get arrested? Even I didn't talk to anyone for two days when I came. Then, you fall into the groove. My name is Rambabu. I work at the Amadalavalasa sugar factory. I'm used to singing ballads in the evenings. I am the singer-cum-writer in our troupe. I told you my story. So, you tell me yours. What can we do, bro? "Whether it's thought or action" "it's all your doing!" "Oh, my Lord, it's all your doing!" "Lord Rama, it's all your doing!" "Allah..." Shut up! - Wow! Can I not talk? I'm already stuck with this sulky face. He doesn't say a word. But I can't stay without talking. Say something, dude. I beg of you. Don't annoy him. Mind you! He's here on a murder case. Bro, don't mind my words. I blabber a lot. Did you get arrested for murder? The song has started but the lights aren't on yet. Father is scolding in English. Make it fast. Wait. There is an issue with the wire. Also, after we light up the Church God should come down to praise us, Sahibu! Here, it's done. Turn on the third switch. [Indistinct song playing] A Hindu and a Muslim worked together to give our Church a festive glow, Soori. Thank you, Father. Pray God that I set up my shop soon, Father. God bless you! Bro! - Yeah? Do you remember your father? Don't anger the dragon. It's time for the worship. Slow down, bro. Don't turn the worship into my funeral. Eyes on the road you can get angry later. We're late. I wonder what he'd say. What time is it? - Don't blame me, uncle. I set the alarm and got ready on time. Your son took all this while to finish his work. I'm not going to school to come home on time! And will the roof collapse if we don't start at eight? Do you see that, Suguna? You left him to me and died. I work hard all day, return home, cook for him and finish with a drink to forget about you. It is not an addiction. Don't you know it? There's no need for the sob story again. Get started. Why should I listen to his insults for two pints of alcohol? I won't drink. Suguna, I'm not drinking. Just have one drink! Else, this will go waste. This is for you. If you don't hold on to your glass and start the prayer he'll drink your share too. - That's true. Even if he has the tiniest space in his stomach, he can eat an elephant. There's nothing new about both of you insulting me. What did you cook, uncle? - What else? It's been the same menu since childhood. Here! There's no taste to it. His son slogs hard every day. Does he ever think of cooking chicken or stew? Do you think I quit work and sit idle? Is this is a military hotel? If you want good food, get married. Good point! Even if you ask me to eat bland food, I'll do it happily. But don't ask me to get married. First, I have to set up a shop in the town bazaar. I'll have to name the shop after my mother. Look! I'll have to remove these tiles and redo the roof. Then, I'll get married. Get lost. I have seen many people like you before. Will you stop this? Bro, I have something urgent to tell you. Bro, do I add soda for you? You don't like it, right? Here! Why add soda? It's like mixing tea and juice. You must drink liquor neat! Only people with indigestion drink soda. Okay, tell me. I know you're expecting some favor. Bro, there's hardly a week left for the race. We need to buy a motor. Lend me some money. I'm okay with Kirloskar too! We can get the latest model! Are you asking him for money? How much do you need? Around 50 thousand. Cool! You've come to the right person. He's a miser of the first order. Do you want money or the motor? I want the motor only. This year looks promising. I need to earn money. I must win somehow. Let's assume you get lucky and he lends you money. Even then you can't win the port as Kasi will be there. Who is that guy? Shiva. Kasi will use him as a puppet to win. Tomorrow, you can find his boats in at least three ports. Do you even know how much Kasi spends to buy those boats? That's it. My life is an ocean and the salt in it is my misfortune. Well said. The best he can do is bring the Madras steel motor, right? I'll make a better motor than that. Of course, he will. - Why don't you lend me money, bro? Money alters relationships. While we're friends now you might sulk when I ask you to repay the loan. Our friendship will be ruined. So, I don't borrow or lend money. But I can guarantee that Soori Babu's work will never fail. I'll build an amazing motor. Trust me. - That's also true. Hey, Sahibu! What's new in town? We're not in Singapore. It's usual stuff! Everyone in our town is talking about the boat race. Mr Kasi plans on contesting the local elections this time. He will never be content with what he has. Can't he be happy with his gold shop? He wants the fishing ponds and every girl in our town. So, his wife left him for good! Anyway, who will vote for him? Greetings! I paid you money to withdraw from the race not because I feared you'd win. It's because of the faith I've in your motor. You know the winner gets control of the port. Why do it then? I won't withdraw from the race. I'm not stopping you from competing. It looks good only when there is a competition. You should also compete. But your boat can't go ahead of mine. It's time for the meeting, sir. I'll leave now. Sit! Sit down. Have coffee and go. Why are you twiddling your thumbs and not having coffee? It's become a habit, sir. Your ring looks really good. I've seen this somewhere. Not a chance, sir. I got Bekwal Sharab to make it for my brother and me! When you say brother, do you mean the guy who carried flags and held protests with others for the 'Our sand, our rights' mission? They said he went missing. Did you find him? No, sir. Whenever I ask the police, they give some reason. There's no movement. Why are you still here instead of going to the meeting? Let's go. Come on! Your pendant looks nice. Did Bekwal Sharab make this too? Greetings! Like every other year this year too, the race will commence from Dariyatippa and end at Kotibillidagarlagarkatla. There should be not more than four people on one boat. Everyone should use single-cylinder motors. The boats should move only after the signal. Bro! He's Shiva. Whoever finishes the lap first and hoists the flag on that platform near the bridge are the winners. They can use the dock for one whole year to hunt for fish. If anyone else goes there we will call the village council and accord punishments! Do all of you agree to the rules? Shall we begin? [Indistinct commentary] - Come on! Go faster! Come on! Come on! Come on! [Indistinct commentary] Go! Go! Go! [Indistinct commentary] Hurry! Come! Karri Durga Rao - 1 [Indistinct commentary] Boo! Try and catch us. Their boat has suddenly stopped. What happened? - How would I know? The boat has stopped. Make it go! They are stuck in an unexpected situation. Go! Go! Hurry! Row faster! What happened, bro? Is there a problem with the motor? - The motor seems fine. Currently, Chitoor Shiva has moved to the first place. Chitoor Shiva - 1 Karri Durga Rao - 28 Bro! Bro! It got stuck in the net. Let's go! Come on, dude. [Indistinct commentary] Come on! Row faster! Move! Move! Let's get it! Go! Go! Go! Come on. Row faster! Come on! Go! Go! Get closer. Come on! Dash them! Come on! Do it! Faster! - Dude, careful. Dude, hold on! - You! How dare you? - Careful, Soori! Push, buddy! Push hard! Climb aboard! The motor might heat up. - We have no choice. The race is getting intense. Chitoor Shiva - 1 Karri Durga Rao - 2 The competition is getting tough! We request the audience to give them a round of applause. Both the teams are almost the same level. They are trying hard to get ahead. Keep going! Come on! - Soori Babu's boat has move forward. Who among the two will win the race? The audience are eagerly waiting to see who comes first. Both the boats are almost at the same level! However, Soori Babu's boat has moved ahead. It is getting exciting! Whoever wins the contest controls the dock! Let's see who finishes first! Bro! The motor has stopped. There is smoke! Soori Babu's boat is slowing down. It looks like it will stop. - Come on. Come on. Speed up! Just go, go, go! - Look! Shiva's boat is racing ahead. Now, Soori Babu and Shiva are at the same level! However, there is some issue with Soori Babu's boat. Soori Babu's boat has stopped. Shiva's boat is racing ahead. We've come to the end of the race. Soori Babu takes a leap to hoist their flag! [Indistinct commentary] Whoa! What a great victory! Chitoor Shiva has lost. Soori Babu has come first. [Indistinct commentary continues] Victory is ours! Shiva was overacting. I thought you'd beat him. I let him go as he is your friend! - He's too much. Durga, you've bagged the prize this time. You're a strong contestant. No one notices you. Which company's motor is it? Local making, sir. My friend made it. Cool! Let it be. Quote a price and leave the port to Shiva. I'll prepare another one for you. The port is ours for this year, right? He will save some and use the rest to drink! Let him speak. Quote, buddy! We can adjust by 5 or 10. Mr Kasi will take care. Durga Rao, what have you decided? It is not so easy to fish here. It is difficult to look after the dock for a whole year. It is difficult to win the dock but we did that. It's after all fishing. We'll take care of it! Why bargain after we won, sir? They'll look after it. Let it go this once. Yes, sir. I'll take care. If something goes wrong, my friend will take care. Why are you rejecting a powerful man's offer? You think too high of yourself! A powerful man should help others and not snatch their things. Let's go. The one who plants gets fruit and one who wins gets the dock! Come on. Bro! We won the dock. Where's the party? We won the dock, right? We'll party there tonight. Promise? - Promise! "Tell me what do you see in the mirror?" "Tell me what do you see in the mirror?" So? "Singapore Rangababu asked me to board the flight!" "The Jeweler Gangi Reddy offered gold to me!" "Yama Babu fixed an auspicious hour" "and expected me to marry Pedduri Naidu!" "Drink up, my crazy friends!" "Come on, dude! Let's get drunk!" "Drink up, my crazy friends!" "Come on, dude! Let's get drunk!" "If we offer you in marriage to Pedduri Naidu" "Maddhoori Peddi Reddy might raise objections!" "Sinnoori Sittibabu got deeply hurt!" "Drink up, my crazy friends!" "This time never comes again, buddy!" "Drink up, my crazy friends!" "This time never comes again, buddy!" "Naidu is my husband! He doesn't do any work." "He went in search of herbs and shrubs in the forest" "and has forgotten me!" "Is that so? Where did he go?" "What did he bring?" "He went east and brought back medicinal stuff!" "He went west and brought a creeper!" "He went South and brought back herbs!" "When he had gone North he brought back shrubs!" "Finally, he vanished in thin air!" "Drink up, my crazy friends!" "Come on, dude! Let's get drunk!" "Drink up, my crazy friends!" "Come on, dude! Let's get drunk!" "Drink up, my crazy friends!" "This time never comes again, buddy!" "Drink up, my crazy friends!" "This time never comes again, buddy!" "Did he buy you a creeper when you asked him for silk?" "Did he pluck a plant when you asked him to pinch you?" "Did he give you herbs when you asked for a kiss?" "Did he go away when you asked him to satiate your desires?" "We are here for you, dear. Kisses for you, drinks for us!" "Drink up, my crazy friends!" "Come on, dude! Let's get drunk!" "Drink up, my crazy friends!" "This time never comes again, buddy!" "Drink up, my crazy friends!" "Come on, dude! Let's get drunk!" "Drink up, my crazy friends!" "Come on, dude! Let's get drunk!" Has everyone arrived? Yes! - All of us are here. Okay! Starting this year our committee has planned on organizing a grand fest for Lord Veerabadraswamy. In this fest that spans three days the devotees or general public shouldn't face any trouble. The money we collect from the fest will be used to renovate our Veerabadra Swamy temple. As the Chairman of the temple I will sponsor a golden crown for the deity this time. All of us should work together. Nageshwar Rao will handle the festival accounts. Priest will take care of the arrangements at the temple. Karanala Madhu will handle the catering. We want my son Kasi to handle the stalls and programs for the fest. You talk, dear. This time we're having big stalls. We're planning for a lot of dramas and dance performances. We're getting a DJ set and lighting to honor our boys' requests. We think it is better if we give the contract to someone from Vizag or Vijayawada. Why Vizag or Vijaywada? No one in this district does lighting like my son. Hence, we are calling people from other districts than from our place. The outsider will have to come to our shop to buy the bulb and wires. Even I bought a new DJ set. We had used my DJ set at the reception of Mr Raju's granddaughter. All of you danced, right? Mr Raju, didn't you like our lighting and sound? We're not belittling your work. I have to say your lighting is better than the ones on TV shows. You're the best at those gimmicks and decorations, dude. It's impossible! - Sir! My son charges lesser than people from other districts! Why go in search of them while he can do it at a cheaper rate? We're discussing, right? Why are you interrupting the village council? Why don't you come and take over then? Hey, you be quiet. Okay, it's our village fest. We must work together! You take the lighting contract this time. Come tomorrow and take the advance. Alright, sir. [Devotional song] Tilt it! [Devotional song] Bro! It seems there is no power in the soda shop. That girl is nagging me. You have to come. I will come. Let me finish up here. - You don't understand. It is impossible to stop that girl. She's like a firecracker! Here you go. This is the shop. Is yours the only shop in the fest? Do you think you can get lights by shouting at us? Look! This useless cooler will use the entire power load. What? Did you call it a useless cooler? Don't you check the load before supplying the power? What's your problem? No power, right? Wait for a while. There are hundreds of shops here. Hello. Every shop has power. Only ours doesn't. - See, nobody has power now. See! - It happened only now. Until now, only our shop didn't have it. Why is this girl arguing so much? She's not arguing. She's wrecking havoc. [Indistinct chatter] Come on, bring it here. The sodas are getting warm and we're losing customers. See this disco dance lighting. It keeps blinking. - Shut your speaker. Did you call me a speaker? How dare you? Mind your words! Here you go. Hey, turn that on. You look nice. Your face and voice don't go together. You have so many customers. Are you paying more? No, he got it for me at a cheaper price. - Who? Mr Kasi! Hey, dear. I see you've made good sales! What are you doing? - What do I then? How long do I stay here? - I got delayed due to work. [Indistinct chatter] Go, dear. Enjoy the fest. Give me all of it, father. - Hey, what? Thank you. Bye. Super! - Dear, there are dogs in the fest. Be careful. I've been seeing them since childhood. What will they do? Let's go. It's always like that. - My count is done. How much is yours? - Hey! My count is four. If I touch one more waist it'll be five. See. That's number five. Who? - The girl with the flowers, dude! Come on. I'll take care. [Indistinct chatter] These bangles? - I have them at home. Come. Let's buy them. Where are you going? Stay for some time. How dare you harass girls in the fest! What village are you from? Useless! - Please, please. Don't! This is our village fest. We come here to pray to God. Jerks like you come here to hound girls. I'm not the type to stay silent when you do things like this. Sridevi! I'm Soda Sridevi. If I push you forward you'll have only one hand left. If I catch you all here again... Get lost. - Run! Let's go. Now, I see the connection between your face and voice. You should not wait for your brother or father to come. Those morons deserve this. She's not a normal firecracker. She's a cannon. If a girl is rough, it means she has a good heart. What? - She's just like my mother. One girl like her is enough to handle the house and shop easily. You've lost your mind. Oh God, look at that girl. I don't know who she is. But, she's tough! She's my daughter, sir. Is it? She is bold! Are you really busy? The entire crowd is outside your shop. It's all your mercy. We just followed your advice. Your fest looks really grand. Here you go. Your soda. It's our special. - Will God come and help if we don't help ourselves? - That's right. It tastes wonderful. Why did you open this soda business instead of joining us? I should have money, right? How many children do you have? - Only one daughter. If I find a good match and get her married my responsibility is done. Do as you please. I'll let you know if I find a good match. What more would I need when I have your word? It's your mercy. Don't go there. Hey, step aside. Come, dear. I can't come these three days. I am handling the shop in the fest. I have to help my father. - Hello. Why are you talking on the phone in the middle of the road? Move your vehicle. Who's on the middle of the road? Look around. We're not taking them to your house. It's for the fest. Fine! Take them to my house. I'll do that. Where's your house? Bro, is your phone ringing? Stop, stop, stop. - Madam. Does it hurt a lot when you hit with this? Don't ask, madam. It can peel your skin. I'm scared to even look at it. It's suffice for the two of us. Let's go. Sir! Usually, you run away from girls. Why do you need that girl's address? She's gorgeous. I like her. How much? - Hundred, sir. I pay only Rs. 30 for shaving my beard. But you ask Rs. 100 to sketch my face. Sir, they are two different things. This is art, sir. Are my eyes worth the effort? Sir, you come here. Sit down. I'll explain. Your eyes look as bright as bulbs. The power will return. 'Finally I had a customer. I lost the ten bucks.' 'Everyone else has power. What's wrong here?' 'They charged me for two bulbs!' 'What's the problem?' What happened, sir? No power? - Yes, sir. Everyone else has it. Only my shop has a power cut. What must have happened? Yes, yes. Only your shop doesn't have it. We don't know when the power will resume or when we'll die. Let me check! This might take time. Let's do one thing. Let's have soda. Come. Come, sir. - Sir, the drawing is incomplete. Will you have a soda? Two sodas, madam. Guest first. Here! Thank you. The marble might get stuck in your throat. Careful. It's still here. Anyway, nothing will happen to me. Everybody will have stones in their kidneys, I'll have marbles. Greetings, sir. - Greetings. Oh, no! Come on, sir. Let's have some soda. It'll be done. Don't move. Gosh! Here, there, everywhere somewhere, I don't care! Power is there! Come, sir. Let's drink soda. 'He's started the performance.' No power? Let me check. Sir, there's nothing to check. Come, come. Let's have a soda. I can draw the pictures anytime. Let's drink the soda. - Alright, alright. Soda. This is your twentieth soda. Will you survive on sodas? She opened it for me, sir. Cheers! This soda tastes great! Where is he? Do you want soda? - I want power, madam. Why do you ask me? I've been watching from the start. When you come to the shop, I face power cut. See, he comes with cutting-pliers. Look there. He's cut about 100 meters of wire. Why does such a small shop need so much wire? Please tell him. He's coming for you! He cuts the power before I can sketch an eye. I don't have any customers. Look here. I've not been able to draw anything except for eyes. Look! Look here. This is my situation. Hey, hey, hey. Be careful. Sorry, Shiva. I didn't see you there. Are you blind? He said he didn't see you, right? Are you each other's mouthpiece? I said, I'm sorry. It is what happens when you dig roads to put up banners. Don't talk as you please. Know your limits! He had granted this contract to you. Nobody gave me this contract. I got it because of my hard work. Got it? Why argue with him, dude? Let's go. An important announcement to the devotees and spectators! On the occasion of temple fest of Lord Veerbadraswamy we invite the devotees and spectators to generously contribute towards the Kakinada Venkateshwara welfare trust and earn the blessings of the Lord... [Indistinct song playing continues] I wonder why such people come to fest. Don't blame me, uncle. Why bother? Come, let's go, start our prayer. Do you know what happened this morning? - What happened? We saw that girl, uncle. Which girl, dear? - I mean, Sridevi from that soda shop. Good name, buddy. She also looks nice, uncle. I think our boy is in love with her. I told you that day, right? I have seen many people like him. Wait! Let me call him. Tell me, dude. - Hello! Where are you? Kuwait, bro. Currently, I'm milking the camel. Stop kidding. When will you come? We're waiting to drink! You go ahead. I'm busy. Hey! Hey! Why did he hang up? Soda! - It's not available. We're closing the shop. - Really? So, can I not see you from tomorrow? I mean, where do I come if I feel like drinking sodas? You have the most sodas during the three days of the fest. Do I look that naive to you? Do you think I don't know why you keep coming here? 'Did you find out?' - My name is Sridevi! Someone like you goofed outside our shop asking for sodas. So, I hit him on his head with the soda. Since then, people call me Soda Sridevi. That's okay. He must have got stitches. Where is your shop? Don't you understand what I'm saying? Look! My dad is here. Ask him. Then you can come home. Dear, have you packed everything? Almost, dad. Our boy will take care. I heard our family deity's temple is here. Come! Let's pray. 'Why is he coming here?' It's a famous temple, dear. People here told me that there is... - What? A temple here. - I'm busy. Why are you so busy? Are you making soda? I told you I'm busy. Hang up. - Our stuff? We'll tell the trolley man. - He's a nuisance! Idiot! I'll switch off my phone. He's declining the call. Wait, let me try again. I'll keep trying until he picks up. Hello? Hey, he switched it off! He refused to get married. Look at him ditching us for that girl! Why are you drinking here when I asked you to watch the puppet show? I'm irritated. Do I look like a fool to them? Why are you getting frustrated? What happened? Soori's dad and Durga are mocking me! Since it's a fest, I'm sparing them. They have been acting smart ever since they won the dock. This morning, Soori splashed murky water on my face. Okay! What have you been doing all morning without telling me? Forget about me. They dirtied your banner... Is he the Village Council President to tell me where to put the banner? He says we laid it in the middle of the road. Splashing murky water on my banner is as good as murky water on my face. Durga is a good guy. Soori is the one causing trouble. Likewise, his dad also tried to act smart with filmy dialogues. They've stopped listening to us. Anyway, the fest is ours. I can handle any consequences. Ensure he's not married yet, uncle. Hey, do I look funny? How dare you laugh at me? Get lost! Who do you think you are for me to laugh at you? You've gotten bolder since you won the dock. What are you saying? Hey, Shiva. We didn't mock you. Let's not fight at the fest. Go! You old fool! You mocked at me. How dare you pin the blame on me? Mind your words. Don't you have respect for elders. Fool! Shiva, don't. - How dare you lay your hands on me? I'll chop you! Mind it. - Hey! You're acting smart with their company. - Don't, Shiva. Listen to me. Let's not quarrel. You! - Let's not fight. Listen to me. Why should I listen to you? Show some respect! Did you or your son listen when I asked you to leave the dock? My son will snap your nerves if he comes to know that you held my shirt. Will he snap my nerves if I hold you by the collar? Hey, Soori. Leave me! Your son had splashed murky water on my face. So what should I do? Sing and dance, is it? Come. Come here! Now I will piss on you. Let me see what he does. Shiva, don't do that. No! No! Hey, Shiva! Soori won't spare you. He will kill you! Hey, Soori! Uncle! Soori! Soori! Let me go! Leave me! Just leave me. Soori, Shiva pulled a quarrel with uncle on purpose. Soori, wherever you are, come fast. Come soon. Where are you, dude? Soori! You! Dad! What did he do? What happened, dad? Soori! He pissed on uncle, dude Get up, dad. Come! Hey, Shiva! Shiva! What's the situation? Is it the fest brawl? MLC report has come and the case is closed. What is the hurry? We can compromise and resolve. He is at the hospital! It's a serious injury and could be fatal. Will Kasi keep quiet? You've been accused of attempting murder on Chitoor Shivakumar. Do you wish to say something? It is true that I stabbed him. I agree, sir. But what did they do? He had pissed on my dad in front of the whole village, sir. What do we do then? My dad lead a respectable life, sir. They insulted him before everyone and brought tears to his eyes. Would you keep quiet if it had happened to your mom or dad, sir? I also did the same. Had I not stabbed him, he'd have beheaded me! If you want, ask the witness. They can testify! Case adjourned. We will hear after two weeks. Bail approved. Give me five sodas. Kasi, all of us come from the same village. Let the bygones be bygones! We can avoid the court if we can resolve it among ourselves. Our man is fatally injured. He got stabbed brutally. I'm young and strong to run to the court. Let's see. - What they did to us isn't small either. Look! They've become arrogant. I will not spare you. - Cool! Let's see. How dare you to talk to me like that? So what? What do you mean? - Hey, wait. What is this? Will you fight outside a court? It's not even thirty minutes since you got the bail. Do you want to go back to the jail? Have you no sense? Okay! We'll do it. Have a detailed chat with Shiva. He is aggressive now. I'll talk to him tonight and take him to meet Shiva tomorrow. It's all in your hands. - Okay, sir. Okay! They are here. Bye, sir. - Come! Sridevi soda center Don't utter a word. I'll convince him. Have you come to see if he is still dead or alive? Aunt, Shiva started the fight. Don't you know? Why do you say so, madam? Don't you know about my son? Have you ever seen him act rudely with anyone? Shiva is a young chap. It's a grave injury. But what he did to us isn't fair either. We can also file a suit at the court. He won't get a bail too! Go and file a case. Who's stopping you? I told you, right? Let's go. Hold on! Hey, he stabbed you only when you hit his head, right? Is it true? People like us can't afford to visit court often, madam. So, we've come for settlement. That is true, sir. Police and lawyers will suck our blood. Tell us what to do now. Please sign these papers, madam. I'll handle the rest. Hey, you carry on. I will finish this work and come. This side, dude. Don't act smart. I already saw you. What brings you here? I should be the one asking you. Why are you here? Why don't you sit outside our shop? Are you following me? Don't you have any other work? Look! Don't ask me silly questions like if I am jobless or have no sisters. I'm here for work. I'm not jobless. I stabbed a person and the case is at the Court. We've come to compromise. But why do you throw an attitude? Yes, you look beautiful. So what? When I saw you at the temple fest, I thought you were okay. The more I saw you, I felt you looked like my mom. So, I fell in love and wish to marry you. I followed you to say this. If you are Soda Sridevi, I am Lighting Soori Babu. We have four hundred lighting equipment, a DJ set and a sound system enough for a huge wedding hall. I do the lighting for all nearby areas. I'm trying hard to open a shop in the town. Don't just keep scolding me. Have you ever asked me about the problems I face? Why should I care? With whom do I share it? - Try my dad! Your dad isn't here. So, you're not going to reply? Go and install your lighting instead of flirting with me. What were you saying? Nothing. Sir is scolding me for not completing my record. Did he scold you? - Yes! Yesterday, we had a good catch! - He has called for my dad. It's extraordinary! I'll repay my debts this year! - Why are these guys here? They must be jobless! She is looking here. - She's coming! I think there is no petrol. Kick hard. Kick hard. What must be the problem? Don't act. What are you doing here? We are looking for a road laying contract. I can see that. Why wait on the road? Just come home. We can all stay together! She is leaving. Who is he? Why do you blush like a rose? Start the bike. Come on! Are they following? An old case and a new guy! He looks handsome. Why don't you say yes? You say yes if you like him. - Hey, Sridevi! Stop! Pull over! You get down. For how long do I follow you? We have to make a decision today. What is this, Sridevi? What do you think? - What do you want? I've been following you for the past two years. Don't you have any mercy or sympathy? If you don't accept my love today, see... Where is it? Here! I brought poison and wrote a letter. I will shoot a video of me committing suicide. One second, bro. Answer me! - How about now? Will you tell... - I understood the whole problem. I will shoot the video, bro. Take this video, bro. It should go viral. Will you accept my love or should I commit suicide? Go die! Okay, bro. Drink it. How can I drink it? It's not juice. Actually, I... Which means you are... For how long? - One week, bro. One week? If it is one week she must have either hurt you or broken soda bottles on you. Nothing like that, bro. - Nothing? I met her at the fest. She hasn't responded yet. Wait, I'll ask her. You ignore me. What about him? Why ask me? Why should I care about the strangers on the road? What do you want her to say? Ask her if she likes me or not, bro. Do you like him or not? I'll slap both of you! She keeps saying it but has never done it. Ask her to stop this nonsense and answer me, bro. Though she appears angry I've seen her eyes light up, bro. He says your eyes light up when you see him! Ask him to say it to my dad. The light will dim out! Will you tell him? - Same as ever, bro! She always says come home meet my dad, tell him! He says you called him home and offered to stay together. Ask him to go and meet. I can go only after she accepts, right? I've been following her for two years, bro. If she had said this at least once I would have met her father. Why didn't you tell me, Sridevi? I understood everything, bro. This girl gave you a signal. Signal? - I won't stop now. This knife... - I'll open it for you. Did you give me a signal? You keep talking about lights, right? Do you know what light you are? Tube light. Tube light? "I'm having a new feeling" "that I have never experienced so far." "I've been hearing a little voice" "in my head over the last few days!" "Though it is a torture" "even this feels good!" "Even your killer gaze" "appears like a cheerful smile!" "Sing a joyous tone!" "My heart dances in joy!" "Oh! The beautiful star is up above" "far beyond my reach!" "I'm having a new feeling" "that I have never experienced so far." "I've been hearing a little voice" "in my head over the last few days!" "She pays me no heed" "despite all that I do for her!" "You can't recognize the diamond" "even if it shines before you!" "How do I tell you the feelings I experience?" "How do I show you my secrets?" "What is this tangled mess?" "You unravel it!" "I'll jump in." - "I'll bear it!" "Then, why do we argue now?" "The rays of the rising sun" "awaken me with a pinch." "Sing a joyous tone!" "My heart dances in joy!" "Sing a joyous tone!" "My heart dances in joy!" While I'm trying to find prospective grooms for her she's been going to cinema halls. Do you know with whom? It's the boy who got filed for the murder attempt. Is this what you do in the pretense of going to college? Do you know the kind of matches Mr Kasi refers to us? Look at how she's glares! She has no shame or regret. She glares at me. We pamper her as she is our only child. It serves us right! I'll break your legs if you step outside the house. Why do you give me that look? Advise her! What do I do with her? I have to do it calmly. Did she eat anything? Go and bring her food! Do you think I want to scold you, dear? Is it okay to hang out with an accused? What will people say? You're soon to get married. Shouldn't you be careful? He didn't commit any crime and land at the court, dad. He fought the evil guys! He's a good guy, dad! Okay! Let him be good! But he's not one of us. Do you think I can't find you a good suitor and get you married? Let go, dear. Listen to me. Study well. We don't need such people. No means no. Okay? Come. Let's eat. Come. Is it good? [Indistinct chatter] That guy is creating chaos. Give us two sodas. [Indistinct chatter continues] Soori Babu! Come here. I started my business with this cart 25 years ago. Look! I worked hard to reach this level. I don't know how popular you are in town. But my shop is famous and I have some respect in society. I also know a few lawyers. Filing another case and sending you to prison isn't difficult. You did wrong, isn't it? We're not from the same caste. You must be aware of your limits, right? Don't take my words to heart. I'm finding suitors for her. Don't come near her. Go. It's been four days since you answered my call or met me! I'm going crazy over here. Shouldn't you at least tell me what happened? Nothing happened. I got to go. Move! What happened? What do I do if you act like this suddenly? I'm getting late for tuition. Move. Will you come to the orchard after your tuition? I have to talk. - About what? I won't come. - But I'll wait. Go and talk to him. I feel sorry for him. My folks got to know! My father is bringing up caste. My guy can't even wait for four days. You're a sadist. How can you take joy in his misery? This is a unique feeling in love. Teasing boys is fun. Why did you ask me to come? Tell me. I don't have time. I haven't informed my folks. Even I don't have time. Nor did I inform my dad. I called you so many times in the last four days. But you didn't respond. Couldn't you answer at least once? And say what? Did your father say something? Did he scold you? Did he hit you? Look at me. Are you feeling sad? I'm feeling very sad. My father doesn't like this. Let's break up! No dad approves the choice of their daughter. Well said. So, my dad found me a good suitor. The groom's family is coming this Friday to meet me. So you were busy with the preparations and didn't answer my call. You don't have to taunt me. I have no reason to reject it. You are roaming around to set up your shop. My dad has found someone who owns four shops. It seems ten people like you work there. I prioritized you over my shop, right? I deserve this. Why waste your time behind me? We liked each other and dated! Let's just forget it now! What? I'll get married and you open your shop. Okay, I'm leaving. Why did you come when you decided to let go? Yes, I agreed then. I'll let go now. Okay? Since you looked like my mom, I fell in love with you. Now, you're ditching me, is it? Do you think our love has grown worthy of each other's lives? Do you call this love? I think you're thinking too much. Isn't this love? Am I thinking too much? You might not have love. But I do. Have you gone crazy? Look at how much blood you're losing. Why do you act like a ruffian? Look here. Look at me. I was just teasing you. But you made me cry. How will I handle you in the future? Do you like me that much? You expressed how much you love me. How do I express my love? I couldn't find a better way to prove how much I like you. Do you understand? I heard that boys take it light after this. Are you also like that? I'm not like them. The groom's family is coming to meet me on Friday. But we're already done with the nuptial night. Tell me what to do now. When shall we start our married life? Your dad won't agree to our marriage. I have an idea. My case will get closed coming Friday. You meet the groom's family and come near Nalantha at 4 pm. I'll get done with the court by two. We can go from there and get married at Annavaram. Do you understand? 4 pm sharp! Okay. If you like our girl we can discuss the rest. Mr Kasi briefed us already. We like the girl. We came here only for a formality! Else, we could have directly met at the wedding. That's how much we trust Mr Kasi's words. Everything is set inside. The case will be closed by two. Masha! - Yeah! The judge will come after lunch. - Really? After lunch? I highly doubt even that! It's okay. He'll come. Ours is the second case. Nothing will go wrong. Don't worry. They'll close the case today. What did the groom's family say? - They like her. When is the wedding? - We have to meet the priest and fix a date. Where are you going, dear? I... Dad, I'm going to Sunita's house. Come, I'll drop you. I'll be right back. - Okay. Come. Bye. Bye, father. - Okay. The murder attempt on Chittori Siva after many consequences today it has been produced before the bench to be struck off. Sridevi! It isn't there, right? The matter is, uncle... Money isn't everything. What are you saying? Hey, stop it. What is this nuisance? Go away that side. Stupid man! The case which was about to be struck off... But the victim Chittoori Siva he died while getting treatment in the hospital. There the attempt to murder case on Suribabu it is being converted as a murder case and pending further enquiry he should be transferred to jail as a culprit under trial this is the order given to the police. What happened? Didn't come yet, did you make a phone call? Suribabu! Suribabu! Chitti! After 4 days it will be August 15th. Like every year, even this year the district collector will come for the flag hoisting ceremony. Therefore the jail has to be cleaned and decorated. If anyone can sing and dance you may perform some patriotic songs. Does anyone of you have special talents? I can dance very well, sir. Sir, I am ready to participate. Sir, I can do the stage sound and lighting. You did a good thing by agreeing to do this work. Now we will be noticed by the jail officer. If they feel good about us even if you get a sentence in future they will recommend it to be reduced. You may go out soon to meet your Sridevi. Do you understand? When my wife gave a packet outside the court you said you won't bring it? Yours seems to be a murder case. There will be many postponements. Tell him about me. He will tell you want to do. Do you understand? Speak up. Did you understand? Why do you stare like that? I will gouge your eyes out! Srinu! What is it? - The lawyer came and you are called. He is Kodikatti Srinu. He's a big criminal. He spends most of his time in jail. He sells liquor and opium in the jail. Don't get into trouble with him. Be cautious. I don't have so much time to get into trouble. I agreed to this work to escape from jail. Hey, take it out. Take it out. - Sir! What were you doing when they entered the jail using... It will be like this if you don't manage properly. The Collector is about to visit. Why do you bluff? Don't spare anyone and check them all. - Okay, sir. Break their bones. Okay sir. - Not even a small mistake should be allowed. We will be out tonight itself. You spoke as if it's very easy. How will you do it? When taking power into the station from South Block I did a small setting. We should go inside by eight p.m. at night? Do a small help. You must turn on the first switch on the board in dining hall. What if I do that? The power will go off. The power in the jail will go off. But the generator is there and it will go on automatically. It will not. Suribabu, didn't you go for dinner? I have a stomach upset. Okay. Finish it quickly, it's getting late. Do it fast. The power went off in the dining room. Go and see it. I will go and check. - Do it fast. Go and check quickly. - Okay, sir. What is the problem? Where are you going? I'm talking to you. He said the generator won't go on. Sir, the main phase in south block has tripped. Sir! Go that side. Come on hurry up! Run! What's happening? No one should come out. Sridevi. Sridevi. Sridevi. It is me. Suri! - Quiet! Suri! Suribabu, you and jail? Now I am not there. I escaped. What if the police catch you? I am not worried about tomorrow. I am only afraid that you will be left alone. I will not become alone. If I come out of the house, I will become your wife. Do you know dog's language? I speak with you daily, won't I know it? Bad joke! Why aren't they coming yet? - They may be making love. Stupid love, if we get caught we will be done for. Take this bag. Go on fast. Let's go. I thought that she went out of control. But she crossed the boundary. She's born to ruin me! Hello! What? You don't worry, I will manage. It's me. The SI's phone is not reachable. They shouldn't cross this Yanam bridge. Gather our men on the other side, I am coming. Drive to that place. Let's go this way. It is very far, who will drive at this time? You are the to speak about general knowledge! What do I lack in? Tell me names of 5 countries, let's see. Our country only is a country. All the others are foreign countries. Shut up and move on. What happened? The petrol seems to be exhausted. - What nuisance! This is called terrible luck. Did I get a dream that he will escape from jail and I should fill the tank? Some vehicle is coming. Hold on! Where will you go? - Kathipudi. Take the vehicles. Take the bag. Hey, take care. You also take care. It's easy to drive a vehicle than to push it. I am unable to understand. Take it... Sir, house of stock broker Prasad. That's the one over there. Is this the one? Suri, come in. Please come. Suri! Come in, you are Sridevi, right? You look lovely. Durga Rao told us everything. You needn't worry. Consider this your own house. You may stay here till all your problems are solved. First get freshed up and have tiffin. Go in. - Let's go in. Come and sit. Thanks, bro-in-law. I am giving you trouble I guess. I don't know what may happen. I thought about nothing else other than Sridevi. Don't worry. To tell the truth, this is a safe place. I didn't tell about your jail thing or she may get anxious. Tell the girl also not to speak about it. Okay, will you take bath? One minute. Go and take bath. Sir! Not much change in Natco firm. I will check and tell you. Gullu! Hey Gullu! Tell uncle to stay near the kitchen. Tell them to get Khushi room ready. I told to bring breakfast long ago. Didn't come till now. Prasad! Prasad! Madam! - What's this, my boy? I took courage that they will perform the marriage. But not started yet. What's this? You have a marriage to attend but cooking here. This isn't good. Nothing like that, we are coming to your place. Some relatives came, we will be there in 10 min. You don't worry, we are there to take care. The groom's party will be here soon. We should show them the guesthouse. We ladies will show it to the ladies on their side. What will you people do? My husband is getting tense. His BP is rising due to tension. Why worry, they won't complain. We will welcome them and bring to the guesthouse. - Okay. Shall I serve some 'Idlies'? It is not to welcome but to remove ill omen. If anyone goes we have to remove ill omen. Married ladies must go with jaggery water give them the jaggery water and put them in guesthouse. - That's correct. It's been a long time since marriage, I forgot. As if they got married recently to remember it! My child, you also come to the marriage. It will be helpful. Prasad, bring the kids also. Come quickly. - Okay. She Mrs Fatima, the owner of the house. She takes care of us like her own family. Her daughter's marriage got fixed recently. These are Muslims but the groom's party are Hindus. It's a love marriage. There is no problem in the marriage. That the marriage would be done the Hindu way. They needlessly gave them word that marriage would be done the Hindu way. And they don't know the traditions. They ask me to personally supervise. And she doesn't know difference between welcoming and removing ill omen. You don't know how to make upma how did she think you will conduct this marriage? Thank god, they laughed. What we could never imagine the marriage between two religious groups is happening. Even for your marriage everyone will consent in few days. Don't do mischief. He said he will be somewhere here. Is he the person? - No. He's a little fat, there he is. - Greetings, sir. Go and play there. Let's go and play that side. - Hello, sir. Please take a seat. - Okay. Okay. - Sir! I spoke to you, it's him. Is he the dear one? Where he want's to go? Dubai or Singapore? They didn't choose any specific place. Let's send them wherever they want. Does he have a passport? I wanted to speak to you about that. I am there for that, tell me. It's okay wherever you send them. But there is a small problem. The boy is involved in a small case. Is it drink and drive, good. It's a murder case, sir. - Hold on. It's not actually a murder. He pierced lightly with a screwdriver. That means it's a murder. You tell me, my dear. The fact is he escaped from jail and came here. What?! - I mean... When escaping from jail I brought along the girl I love. This dear boy you spoke as if they came by bus from one place to another. It's not Dubai or Singapore but a lawyer that you need to go to. Sir, that possibility is not there. Only you can help them. I can do it but it involves a lot of paper work. And some expense too. No problem, we will spend. If one can spend money in India one can arrange anything except parents. When can we go? You are quite fast, dear boy. Need to wait a week. Till then be careful not to venture outside. I will send you a message, keep the money ready. Okay, will do. - I take your leave. Our problem is solved. Bro-in-law said this. I met that man. In one week we can go off to Nepal. A job is also ready there. What, Nepal? - Yes. We need to change our names, that's all. Should we change names? Your name will be... Chinki Koirala, how's it? What would your name be, Bunty Bahadur? Bunty! Isn't it nice? This is even better. If everything went well even our marriage would be performed like this. If your father were good, it would have been done well. See here, now that I came with you it doesn't mean that I left my father. That I love you doesn't mean I don't love my father. I like and love you. I like and love my father also. You shouldn't abuse him. Do you remember your family so much? From now you are everything to me.

'All the necessary arrangements...' Cipla? Sir. - 'The under trial Suribabu, who escaped from Ramachandrapuram sub jail the search is going on to find him.' 'Two special teams have left from Rajamundry.' Sir, I will call you later. 'They have started off to catch Suribabu.' 'It is learnt that he is hiding.' Padma, where is Suri? - I don't know. What happened? - Where did he go? He went out saying that he will return shortly. I told him not to go anywhere considering the situation. Where did you go? You both go inside. What happened? - Where did you go? I went to the ATM. We need to pay to Devudu babu. I withdrew money for that. You only spoke and settled. It will be good if you pay him yourself. What is this? Did you draw so much money from the ATM? I have been drawing since 3 days. We need to pay him. Why are you feeling tense? Do you understand what you just did? The jail... Did you forget that you jumped jail? In the TV... - Prasad! That's why I did not draw from a single place. I did that from 3 ATMs. - Prasad! Why did she come at this time? Prasad! My dear. Dear girl... You... She's my daughter. I thought that she would keep her word. I kept bringing her back whenever she left with him. Now even if we make her take a test of fire who will marry her? Brick by Brick I made my life. Now whoever comes to my shop they are not coming for business. They are coming to enquire about my daughter. A criminal taken to court entered my house. He ruined my reputation. Losing reputation is as good as losing a life. I find it hard to see you in this situation. I don't know whether I can ask you this. I tell you what I feel. I got separated from my wife. I am older than your daughter by about 10 years. If you agree, I will marry your daughter. Your daughter will live like a queen in my house. Please think and tell me. You can regain your reputation that was lost. Tell me if you are okay. I came for help. But you saved my reputation. How can I deny? What does he say? - He will talk to the lawyer. I'm here. Please don't worry. I will take care. How are you doing, Suri? We are working on your case. You need not worry. We went to the High Court, and will get a bail. You must remain calm till then. My dear friend. How is my Sridevi? Why don't you say anything, speak about her. She is fine, how are you doing? Did you meet her that you say this? Yes, she is fine. The lawyer is trying hard for your bail. I'm asking about Sridevi and you are changing the topic. I said that she is fine. Why do you hesitate in saying that? Did you meet her, did she give any message to me... you have to say such things. Why do you always talk about Sridevi? Don't you feel like asking about your father? My father would be fine. Tell me about Sridevi. What? Your father would be fine? He is anxious about you and became bedridden. I was beaten black and blue. You are clamoring about Sridevi. You escape from jail. You did everything for that girl. Do you know what she did? You are here in the jail, but she went to marry Kasi. What are you talking about? I'm Speaking with a clear head. Sridevi got married. By the time you get released from jail she would be sleeping with a child. Clamoring for Sridevi! Now Sridevi is not yours. Come, sir. Srinu, Do you know why he escaped from jail? It was for his lover it seems. And now she got married it seems. Srinu, don't get into trouble. The jailer isn't here. I have some work, go away. Go away. Careful Srinu, I shouldn't face trouble. Is she your lover? Did you have coffee and tiffin? What about food? No! He couldn't have done anything. That's why she found another man for enjoyment. By the time you go, he will have a feast of her. You will be left with leftovers. Even that would be fine. Hey! Do you feel sad? Why don't you speak? Would you get Sridevi married?

She is mine forever. She is indeed yours. If it is already four months now. How long will you remain like this? Suribabu! You have been granted bail. You may go outside tomorrow. You are going out on bail. Remember that. What do you want to do now? Sridevi. She is married, and you should forget her. What if she's married? What if marriage is over? She is mine. Whatever condition she may be in, she will come if I call. Love is blind. You are speaking with emotion. We both came here because of this anger. I'm happy that you are going out. That girl's life is set. Don't go and ruin it. Because you will find a good girl yourself. You will marry her. But... The person who died when you stabbed that person's mother will never regain her son. The person who enters the jail and a person who leaves from jail they are never one and the same. He has come. Suri! How are you doing? You go, father. I will come shortly. - Okay. I knew that you would come here. How long will you keep thinking about her? I told you that they changed house after she got married to Kasi. No one stays here. That girl got married and went away. I made a mistake, madam. It just happened at that time. I separated you from your son. I cannot bring your son back. Please forgive me. You did not do any mistake. You didn't do anything. Please come, why did you come so early? Why take the effort? Some things have to be done in the wee hours. How are you feeling now? The injury has cured. They said he can go home in a week. Your injury is cured. What about the injury that I suffered? It is very hard to be a good man. My wife didn't like that I enter other homes. She left me, so be it. When I was about to settle with it as my fate I found a lovely girl Sridevi. I may have seen many girls, but this one is special and I can't forget. I am planning to propitiate her father. But Suri found favour with the girl. When I was wondering how to sidetrack him it was my good luck that you got into a fight with him. I like you very much. I made you piss on Suri's father so as to enrage him. I thought that you would break a limb or two of his. But you suffered the injury. Let it be. I got a case slapped on him and thrown in jail. If she gets married, to an impotent man I thought that I could set up something. All that is fine and that girl is made for me. When I was thinking like that and now you want to make a compromise! You should not feel sorry that you killed a man. With a desire for that girl, Kasi killed my son. And he got you sent to prison. Hail the Lord! Hail the Lord! Hail the Lord! Hail the Lord! Hail the Lord! Hail the Lord! Hail the Lord! Hail the Lord! Hail the Lord! Hail the Lord! Hail the Lord! Hail the Lord! Hail the Lord! [Tribal song] [Tribal song] [Tribal song] You destroyed my life. Would Sridevi go with you just like that? If I call her, she will come to me right away. I will kill you and take my revenge. Hey, where is my Sridevi? Would she come soon as you call? Call her. Call her. Do you know where Sridevi is? Do you know where she is? My dear, the marriage is over. How shall we enjoy the first night? Take this. When you went past me, the fragrance of your body it would drive me mad. Take your hand off. Take off your hand. Go and sleep. How dare you hit me! Leave me. Come here. How dare you hit me! Sridevi! Sridevi! Sridevi! Sridevi! Sridevi! Open the door. Sridevi, Open the door. What is this blood? What happened, son-in-law? This is great. I married her to save your prestige, and this is what she does to me. Devil, why did you become like this? Ruining our family reputation! Both of you shout loudly about prestige, what is that thing? Would I become your wife just because you tie me the nuptials? I am Sridevi, the soda Sridevi. I am the wife of Suribabu, do you understand? You cannot touch me till I remain alive. If you try to drug me and take me to bed I will consider that I slept with Suribabu and not with you. Whenever he gets released from jail, I will go with him. It is just because you are considered a reputed man that my father got me married to you? From tomorrow I will call any man whom I like on the street. I don't care about their age, it's fine if he is a man. Kasi is impotent and therefore his wife is after every man in the village, that's what people should say. That is the punishment I will give you. If I get mad I will kill you by hitting between your legs with a stone... and I will go to spend time in jail with Suribabu. Come and touch me! Touch me! I will convince her, I will speak to her. She's out of control, out of bounds. You heard what she said. There is no point talking about reputation and caste. Decide how you will preserve her till he returns. Or if you will make her say that I am her husband and bring to my house. Think about that and tell me, I leave now. You made me stand naked in the street. I did not make any mistake, I just fell in love. You are married now! - I was married long ago. You decide if you want to desert me or desert your reputation. Did she eat food? I thought out well. This will not good for us. But if you try with your heart, this marriage will work out. We all can live happily. I cannot kill my heart. But what is my mistake? All this is a mistake. Now you are married. It is a question of our family reputation. What is a greater mistake than to love one man and lead marital life with another? But there are some customs. You must think about the family reputation. This is not the generation that considers reputation caste and creed. We are only concerned with the union of hearts and desire to go along. You are running your shop with the same old board. Flexis are now the norm and the world is changing fast. No one has the time now to think about another. Times may have changed. But some things don't even I can't change. You spend half your life, but you don't want to change. My life has just begun. I will also not change. Please listen to your father's advice. If you take an adamant stand, what can we say to Mr Kasi? This is our family matter. No, it is an issue related to our caste. Your girl went far away soon after she became an adult. She is beyond our control, now it's up to you. We cannot desert her because she's out of control. In a single statement after she said that her life is her decision. It should be us who should fall in line. Okay, my child. I thought that your marriage would settle the matter. Let bygones be bygones. There is nothing we can do now. I know about your strong will. Let's go and have food. Father, Suribabu is a very good man. I know that, let's have food first. Let's discuss the other things tomorrow morning. My child! What are you doing? Leave her, Open the door! Alas! Alas! Hubby! My dear, wake up. Our child! Please wake up. Stop, don't harm my child! Don't do anything to her! Let her go! My child! Please wake up. Wake up, my dear. Just see what he's doing. He is killing our child! Don't do it! My child! Please save my daughter! Save her! No! Alas! Alas! Alas! What a tragedy! Alas! Alas! If you utter a word, I will finish you along with her! In 25 years of marital life with you and 20 years of raising her what did you understand about me? If we have children who marry into a lower caste did she think that I would embrace and kiss her? I got her married to a man whose wife deserted him. It means that I want my daughter to marry within my caste. I told her many times not to stick to her stand. I'm asking you whether I told so or not. She didn't listen! She would never care! She is not concerned about caste! And I don't want such a daughter! You are telling me a lie. You are telling me a lie, Kasi! I did all this just for the sake of attaining Sridevi. Her father. He used to call me every time she escaped. If he told me a few minutes before she was buried I would have enjoyed her just once. You killed your daughter. And enjoying your food? Can you digest it? Crap! You did for the sake of your reputation? Tell me what you gained. A shop which you spent 25 years in developing it's gone. Someone who you raised lovingly for 20 years... that daughter is gone. You don't have a face to show to the public. Where is your reputation? You objected giving your daughter to me because I'm from a low caste. Caste was decided on the basis of the work people performed long ago. But where is it said or written that some caste is high and other is low? But the caste of a person who killed his daughter and buried her in a grave, is there any caste lower than that? You are the one of a low caste, rascal! Just because I went around with her for 10 days I couldn't forget her and feel like dying everyday. You extinguished the lamp of your house and sit in darkness. How are you able to live? Is your caste and your reputation so great? I want to cut you to pieces! But you are a person who killed his daughter and as a father and a person you were dead long ago. I cannot kill a corpse like you, in the name of lower caste. 'Don't clamour for reputation.' 'Our reputation is not based on the opinion of people outside.' 'It lies in the discretion of the heart.' 'Don't kill your reputation by suffering under an imaginary burden.'
