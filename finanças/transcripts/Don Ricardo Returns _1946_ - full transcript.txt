[ Music playing ] Ahh! Touché. I've seen few men to equal you at this sport. But my first touche, almost on top of the shoulder, too high above the heart. You have already pierced my heart. Please, señor luera. I appreciate everything you do to relieve me of my worry, but I have only for Don Ricardo to come home. I know, I'm sorry. Don Ricardo is my cousin, please forgive me. Orange juice. Mama Teresa, you're always so considerate. And prompt. Too prompt. Your overseer awaits without, señor. Por correno. If you will excuse me. Bah! Always watching to see with his telescope. And luera with his runners coming and going between here and monterey... The Santa Maria docked at monterey last night. Then I must ride at once for monterey. Captain Martinez will be expecting me. I think you fret too -- let me do the thinking, fool! I take no chances. See that the road guards are posted. And my order to them is to kill Don Ricardo on sight. Sí, señor.They already have the order. [ Playing softly] Bring me fish... A pate... Venison... A bottle of well-aged madeira and a sweet. We have black bread and goat's curd to match a peon's price. Bring what I ordered. What stomach have you for such food? Names you've learned by serving at the banquets of the dons? Treat that coin well, landlord. It has been my companion for more than two years. You shall be served, señor. He talks likes a Ricardo. Serve him. Water oozes from his clothes. He must've swum the bay. What ship came in last night? Santa Maria. Captain Martinez is the skipper. Go find him. Go on, tell him where he can find his deserting seaman. He pays good bounty. And you? Vamos. Have you seen capitán Martinez? Capitán! Capitán! A deserter from your ship is at the cantina. When did he come? Half an hour ago, I have searched for you all over the waterfront. Come on. Oh, landlord! My change. Wasn't the food good enough, my lord? Don't jest me, man, I've got far to go. My change. Change for what? There is no change, dog. I warned you to treat that coin gently, scullion. It was worth twice the value of your food. I should be a part of this! To the door, hombre. Thanks, my enormous friend. We may meet again. How are you called? They call me lugo the huge, Don Ricardo. You know me? By the scar. Even though the rest has changed. You were a small bambino. Your pony threw you and I picked you up. My pony fell, you big ox? How fare you now? Food and fight is all I ask of this life, señor. I would like you to furnish me boat. You would tie to me? I do not want your blue blood against you. We'll go to huge's wide mine. From what I hear of the rancher at San Luis Rey you are likely to have need of me. You have news of San Luis Rey? And my cousin luera? Maybe of another... Wait! I am in luck, friend lugo. Take this vodka, blue blood. I have never learned to fight with nothing but feet and fists. Let me go! Ha ha! Like a bug on a pin. It's you! That guy that you've kicked and cursed through seven seas for the past two years. Sailing is hard life, señor. Shall I break this one too, blue blood? Hold 'em fast, and stand witness to what this pultroon has to say. Who brought me drugged aboard your filthy ship? Name the man who had me shanghaied! Answer or I'll split you like a capon! I was paid well -- double was promised to me when I reported you dead. But you let me live -- a prisoner in your fo'c'sle when we reached here. I intended to collect again every time I come to Madrid with you -- alive. Name him, or I'll spill that bilge you call your blood! It was...Jose luera. My cousin -- you lie! No, no, señor,please! My brain has ached with the thought of everyone but him. Go then, master blackmailer -- report me dead and collect your price. You disappoint me, blueblood. You should have lifted out that hombre'sgizzard! You say you live to fight? Sí. Come, amigo, for your life has begun. Ha ha! Remember, you have seen nothing and heard nothing since we came ashore. Sí, capitán -- we have no knowledge of the one who escaped. I collect from this luera before he finds out that this shanghaied scum still is alive. My word -- luera will be here tonight. And don't forget -- I will tell you exactly what you know, and don't know! Tell me in detail what you have seen at San Luis Rey. There is work on these ranches -- work and I do not agree. Some things I see in passing in camino real, other things I hear in the mission. You have large ears. What have they heard about señorita flores? Two months ago, I saw her out riding. Before that, a year gone, at the funeral. Poor girl -- father dead, alone on that great rancho... But this tale you have about cousin luera, it's hard for me to understand that, lugo. You bluebloods, you have weak stomachs. You believe luera had you shanghaied, no? Then he has robbed your rancho, he has changed the brands on your sheep and grainsacks, and the same brand appears on everything shipped from your ranch. I must identify myself to give proof of this perfidy to the governor. Then, under the code, José luera is entitled to an affair of honor. Ha ha ha! You will last no longer than a flea under a thumbnail. You are a peon, now. The life of a peon is not worth -- that. The moment you appear, there is a knife in your back. You are just another peon who thought he was something and wasn't. But the mission can identify me... Sí,identify youbetween two burning candles, stretched out stiff with coins on your eyes. What benefits you then? Jose luera -- who was that riding lackey to him? Pocareno, his overseer. It was he who sent the servants for both ranchospacking and brought in his own kind to do his dirty work. You are right, lugo. I must first obtain proof against these criminals, then take the evidence to the alcaldeand the governor. Aha, but Jose luera is a power in both places. Even now, he goes to work some cutthroat scheme. His mother was half-sister to mine and witnessed me. I swear on the name of my own mother, I shall crossblade him if it takes a year in hiding! Are you with me? Food and fight and a flagon of wine. That is all the pay I ask. That you shall have and more, amigo. Abominable stench! These ratholes turn my gorge. Sit, captain. Speak fast. The contract was completed, señor,he is dead. He has seen his last day. How and where? Round the horn. A terrific blow! Keep your tales for kitchen wenches. You saw him go? I heard his screech above the waves! He was over the side, in the roaring sea! How do we know he did not make the shore? Give your evidence. There was a knife in his back to the hilt -- the deck was red with his blood until next whitewashing day. Hunh. You have brought a copy of the log? Aye, that I did. Official as only the captain of a ship of his gracious king can make. Sign it, capitán. Landlord, bring writing instruments. Señorita. Dorothea, this is no place for you. It is a castle and someone in it bears news of Don Ricardo. I could not wait at home any longer. Alas, my dear, the news is bad. Come. Capitán,tell is as gently as you can. It was around the horn, señorita. A terrible storm... With my own eyes, I see him go over side. Tell me there is hope -- he was a fine swimmer. In the roiling sea, miles from land? He was hurt, there was blood -- enough. You're speaking to a lady. Come, dorothea, this place -- the capitánwill give his report to the alcaldeat San Diego when he reaches there. I want the truth first. Why did Don Ricardo sail on yourship? He saw more chance for adventure on my ship, or so he told me. Adventure?! Adventure of what sort? Oh, senorita, the man is dead. The saints would not forgive if I foul his name. You lie, capitán. Don Ricardo is a man of honor. Señorita,my word is law! I saw it with -- stop! Don't twist a knife in the wound, my dear. I am not satisfied. Ricardo may be dead, but the rest is lies. Lies, I tell you! Come, my dear, I'll take you home. Ha ha ha! The walnut stained you the color of a cholo! What is there between a peon and a blueblood but the looks? Aye, but even a peon shaves. Once a month, amigo, if he is lucky. My muscles are stiff from work on that accursed ship. How are you with a blade, lugo? No, theseare my weapons. I'd give you scant practice with the foil. Practice I must have before I face luera, he is no mean blade, himself. Wait -- if padrecarlos is still at the mission, maybe he will consent to a bout. A priest? Ha ha ha! He rather fence with a scepter candle, eh? We can ask. See, amigo, the brand has changed. "Jl" -- Jose luera. Does that convince you? El rancho camino, but the jl brand. It is the same with the tallow, the beef -- everything. This luera owns both ranches. Away, thief! You swore a blueblood's oath to cross blades with luera --- now, listen to a peon's curse: I'll have the gullet of that one for a wristband, I swear it! You restrained yourself, my friend, for all could have easily could have been lost. Feed me no more restraints -- I am not a hound that goes well on the leash. Await me, then. A few moments alone in the chapel is all I need. Sí. [ Organ playing ] Holy mother, I offer thanks for this safe return. In many lands I have prayed, and thou hast answered me. Help me, holy mother, to meet future strife with honor. [ Prays in Latin ] You have suffered, my son? Father Carlos, do you remember me? Your face is familiar -- I am Ricardo ruiz. Don Ricardo? No...and yet -- have you some proof, my son? When I was a boy, my pony fell. His hoof struck me, I was brought here for your surgery. The youth who picked me up awaits outside. The scar, of course I remember. But what means this, Don Ricardo, these habiliments, and your face, so drawn, your eyes, distraught? A dreary tale, father. I came to ask your help. Come, my son. My own cousin had me shanghaied, and now believes me dead... [ Bells tolling ] Infinite is the mercy of the lord to have preserved you through these vicissitudes. I commend your courage, my son, but to take work now as a peon on your own rancho is foolhardy, fraught with danger. I see no other way -- proof, I must have, and then evidence for the alcalde. If I announce myself without these facts, I am but a crazed peon whose death is no more important than that of a cur. But should you have success with the alcalde, still I foresee the inevitable affair of life and death. Jose luera will invoke the laws of combat of your rank and station, and, perforce, you will have to defend yourself. [ Priest prays in Latin ] I am stiff from toil, my muscles are hard as lead. How may I get practice with the foil? Not I, my son, I am a man of peace. But, ah, the cause being just, perhaps our father will find a way. Then I must see dorothea. You must avoid Jose luera, and, for the time being, dorothea. As you say, father. Will you give me a letter of recommendation to porcareno for me and lugo? Certainly, my son. Bracero!my horse. Dorothea! Trouble rides early. Already he owns our silence. Do not open doors too quickly, I might get a bad fall. Your ears are already bruised from pressing against keyholes. You mustn't mind her, señor luera. When will you cease to call me "señor"? I ride to San Diego del calla. So quickly? These legal matters are unpleasant enough -- I registered at the church this morning. But to record a death on the word of that sea captain! A sea captain is sworn by oath to uphold the laws of Spain. His documents are as binding as the courts. He hinted at other things. If the fact of Don Ricardo's death is no more truthful than that-- you are still suffering from shock, dorothea. If you will only accept my -- you have been kind, taken responsibility for this ranch... Some women remain steadfast to a memory, but I cannot believe that Don Ricardo is lost. Time is a great balm, my dear. Adiós. It will be a few days only -- porcareno will do your bidding. So...he files the document. His power in politics hastens his claimed inheritance. It is his right. Have I trusted Jose luera too long as a gentleman? So now he owns both ranchos -- one by inheritance, and yours through debt. The debts will lift, Theresa. Get my habit -- I go to church to light the candles. [ Bells toll in distance ] Death! That luera -- the scum, ordering the funeral! He had to let everyone know. Remove your hats. Kneel and cross yourselves. That bell is for the master of this ranch, Don Ricardo, dead at sea. Get up. The priest recommends you -- "hard working, honest." You! You were in front of the mission. Gracious master, you mistook me for a thief when I merely wished to see the brand before asking for work. It was on account of you scum I almost came to grief. How are you called? Manual, my lord. I'm a mission pilgrim from monterey. Share that hut. Your ration is from the commissary night and morning. You have felt my whip, it falls also on the lazy. Now get out of my sight! Hear the bells, amigo? Few men kneel and cross themselves at their own funeral. That's bad luck for porcareno. His gullet sticks out, ready for the plucking. Phew! It's full of vermin! We sleep outdoors tonight, amigo. Lugo. I never kept hovels as this for the working people. Aha, but times have changed. To the fields, dogs! Join the others in the fields! If he strikes again... Save your strength... Our day will come. Holy Mary, preserve him, protect him. Holy father, bring Ricardo home. Give US a sign, precious one, give US a sign. Priest: Have faith, my children. Ha ha! Come on. Enough! I am breathing like a blacksmith's bellows. Throw that thrust again. An old trick of mine misfired. No, no, no! Not in the back, señor. We'll try again. Ah! My wrist is stiff. Why not do it this way, amigo? We'll try again. Blood. By my grand size beard, you need no leech to bleed you at this game. That's a fine thrust you have -- the needle barely nicked the flesh. Hello, father. How goes the practice, Ricardo? It is a question of speed, father. The heavy thrust and guard remain, but quick movement and flexible wrist, they're gone. My feet are too big for this dancing, father, I do not help him. You know, father, a few hours with a fast opponent, I'd be ready. [ Bells toll ] It is time for you to leave. Blessings be with you, my son. Thank you, father. My favorite blade... Blessed by holy vows these many years. "Master suite..." So now it will be "master porcareno's." Don Miguel porcareno, master of all you behold in San Luis Rey. Sí, señor. Dog swine! Address me as Don Miguel. Sí,don Miguel. [ Thud ] Porcareno: The noise came from here. Thieving swine! Call the braceros, loosen the dogs! Braceros! Braceros! Braceros! Braceros! For a moment, I feared the day's toil had been too much for you. No, we worked in the orchard. Lugo loafed all day under a tree, praying to the saints for porcareno to catch him. I see you've obtained the clothing. And my favorite sword, a few papers and the land Grant records. But the returns from the sale of both ranches were not in the safe. Let that not worry you now. I made arrangements for you to shave and bathe so that you might change into your own attire. You think the muscles will loosen and the old science of the blade will return more quickly, then? Aye, my son, indeed I do. And this new fencing master, he is quick? And light, with an astounding grace. He will fence with bare foils, risk the bloodletting? Perhaps, but I think the decision will be yours to make. Dorothea! Ricardo! Oh, father Carlos told me everything! Oh, Ricardo, there are no words, no words! And none to say what is in my heart. You are thinner... Those poor, hard hands. All I ask is a return to their former suppleness. It shall be returned. We made a good sport of this in the old days. Is this what you would call an ecclesiastic surprise, padre? Call it what you will. Now, get going -- time is short. I promised you a fencing master with speed and grace. Not to mention charm and great beauty. 30 minutes. En garde,ricardo! Touché! Your parry was a bit slow, Ricardo. En garde! 30 minutes. The old skill comes back slowly... Too slowly. It will come back, Ricardo. I will take you home. No, my son, the risk is too great. Be not impatient, return to the task you've planned so well. Mama Theresa awaits with the horses -- I shall be all right. Goodnight. Only a half hour each evening -- I need hours alone with you. Before the time candle burns down, Ricardo, your full skill will have returned. Goodnight, dorothea. Until tomorrow. [ Bell tolling ] Without buttons, Ricardo? Too dangerous. Bare blades, Ricardo? No, no -- in a moment of excitement... It is the only way your full skill can return. If this should Pierce your skin, I shall never forgive myself. Take care, my son. You have suffered tragedy enough. En garde,ricardo! Enough! My blade almost nicked you then. Fight, Ricardo, fight! Thrust! Thrust! Think that I am luera trying for thy blood. Ricardo! It was my fault, you are hurt. It is nothing. Salt, my son -- this will sting. It will be sweet pain, good father. My sweet darling. It was worth a hundred scratches, even a mortal wound. You must let your arm heal before we fence again. I am in shape, darling. A few days more and I'll be ready. But luera might have left San Diego -- he may be here even now. Good. I am ready for him. Let your arm heal first. She is right, be patient. You will have to defend yourself against a most dangerous opponent. Luera is fast and aggressive. Very well, father. Everlasting Patience is the life of a poor peon. Peon? Oh, Ricardo, my love! To labor like that! I am learning much of value, my darling. San Luis Rey will be much the better ranchofor it. Should you need me, tell porcareno to ask for the services of Manuel and lugo. 'Tis the hour. You must leave quickly. Ah, señorita flores. A million pardons for my intrusion. Be gone, dog. Scum. He suspects a lovers' meeting, a rendezvous. I know, I read it in his face. His tongue will wag like the clapper of a bell when Don luera returns. Fear not, Ricardo is back. Soon we shall be our own masters again. Bend your backs, dogs! Halt! What goes? Bear your shoulder. We quarreled. It was my knife. Silence! That is a sword wound. How can you know the art of sword play, swine? I have fenced for sport. You, a mission pilgrim from the south? I have served a Don, señor. Oh, come to my house. I have a task for such as you. Amigo,there is a head of hot gas in me like a beer barrel in the sun ready to burst! Don't explode -- this porcareno may be playing into my hands. What does this baboon want, do you think? In the house the other night, he was preening before a servant, calling himself a hidalgo and master of all that you behold at San Luis Rey. Peacock. A peon on horseback. Pardon me, señor. I go to meet señorporcareno. [ Pompously: ] Don Miguel porcareno. What are you staring at? Speak! Señ --mast -- hidalg -- señor hidalgo porcareno, there is a lowly peon who wishes audience with you. Don't stand there gaping like a moonstruck cow -- send him in! Sí, señor. You wanted me, master? Enter. Be gone, dog. You say you have served the dons? In Spain, before I emigrated. And at the ciudád. I judge you for something besides a field hand. You know the manners for such things as this? Sí,master. Show me, scum. That is how it is done, master. Bueno. It wants practice, master. Often the dons practice by the hour. There are other details. For instance, if one were to approach a lady, I mean, a lady.. If a lady was known to have had visitations elsewhere, what you do then? She would still be a lady, master. Call me Don Miguel, I would taste the flavor. Don Miguel. There are other matters. There is always the snuff box, Don Miguel. Oh, good -- that is a point. That is how it is done in the king's court. You have been in the king's court?! As a page, Don Miguel, when I was a small boy. What... ...is that? Ah... Ah... Ah -- ah -- ah -- aachoo!!! Be gone, dog. Come back tomorrow. If it pleases you, Don Miguel. Ah -- ah -- ah -- aachoo!! Ha ha ha ha! The snuff! I would give my left lung to see this! And you should have seen his bow to a lady, it was pathetic! Ha ha ha! What do you suppose he'll want today? [ Horse approaches ] He takes the trail to rancho camino. So I see. "The lady is known to have visitations elsewhere." Come, big ox, I promised you that one's gullet -- if porcareno is up to what I think he is, the rest is yours. Is she going to be much longer, tongue wagger? Hold thy Patience, scum, she has consented thee, and that is enough. You wanted to speak to me? There is much to say, señorita. Is it about the rancho? Well, yes, and other matters. Please sit down. It concerns many matters. When he returns from San Diego, señor luera has promised to deed me these lands. Rancho camino? The same. He then declares me overlord, and with his influence in San Diego, he may have me dubbed "Don". This nonsense. Rancho camino is mine by inheritance from my father. And señor luera's by debt. It is a misfortune, but such is life. Señor luera and I are very close. You have known señor luera a long time? Oh, yes. But, señorita,i came on a more personal mission. I shall have these lands, and perhaps a title. When señor luera returns, I shall discuss the ranch affairs with him. But señorita, this concerns another matter. Please! Oh! Go, scum, before I loose the dogs on you! I am of a station equal to her, or soon will be. You will belong in the station with the killers! Ha ha ha! But listen -- It is time -- and spoil everything? No. He is a buffoon. He is mean and dangerous, but still a buffoon. This stomachs me not one bit, blueblood. You promised action, you give delays. Let's be gone before my Patience bursts! Bracero,my horse. For a successful journey and a safe return, thanks be to thee. Oh, good friar, you're up early. My work knows no hours. And have you had a successful journey? I have had the ear of the governor. The chapel, it needs more color. And the alter -- make the changes and send me the bill. Graciás, señor. May I remind you, these simple things were brought from Spain, brought across the isthmus on the backs of pilgrims. As you will. [ Groaning ] Help me, father. Support him to the surgery. He was hurt, good father -- an accident. Speak the truth freely, my son. Here stands the master of the rancho, the one man who may right your wrongs. He was whipped, days ago -- we hid him in the brush. Last night, they loosed the hounds on him. This is a nightly occurrence. Your overseer whips these poor men like dogs. My overseer whips only when it is necessary. However, I will look into it. Good day, father. Holy father, set this man's mind to order. Bracero! Bracero! Porcareno! Porcareno! Sí, señor? Where is he? Don't stand there staring, find him! And have food brought to me. Ah, porcareno. Señor luera. "Don luera" now. Ah, Don luera. What news have you? Have you received payment for the tallow? I have received 1300 riales for the tallow -- it is in the cash. Good. Soon we will make the division. And the land? We will discuss that later. What news of our neighbor? Oh, Don luera, much. So it is on that you wish to speak. Speak then! What is at the rancho camino? She rides at night -- a rendezvous somewhere near the mission. Liar! Another word and I run you through. Please, you are a hidalgo, señor, you rule over great lands, it is my duty to defend the honor of your name. Unless with your own eye you saw, repeat me no further breath of this scandal! I swear, señor! I encounter her, spoke to her, and she replied! Filthy swine! You are lower than crawling vermin! Say your prayers. Hidalgo,please --i speak the truth! I swear by all that's holy! These words you utter had better be true. Draw my bath. Sí, sí. Prepare fresh clothes and have my horse ready. Sí,don luera. Be gone, dog! Sí, Don hidalgo! Dorothea! Dorothea! Our neighbor arrives. Porcareno? Worse, luera! Go to the overseer at rancho San Luis Rey, tell him I want the services of the new peons, Manuel and lugo. Dorothea, you are fair as these blooms you tend so well. What news in San Diego, señor luera? I had the ear of the governor. My poor cousin's death was duly entered into the records. In two months, I sail for Spain. No one has questioned the sea captain's documents? Oh, dorthea. In life we are ever close to death. You must accept what the fates send. Don Ricardo is dead. Very important matters to discuss. You know, of course, that I inherit rancho San Luis Rey? These lands are a burden to you, my dear. I-- My words need privacy, hag! Heh! When do you face this cousin? It's impossible, one word and he would have US both killed -- peons who dare to dress hidalgo. I know, but what I ask is when? What are you doing, scum? You two conspire over much, I think. We were discussing the task, señor. I am a landmaster here now! You, the big one -- go to the hacienda rancho camino. The mistress there has a job for you. For both of US? Silence, pilgrim. I have work for you at the house. Make haste, dogs! Watch your step -- if anything goes wrong, run to the mission. You! To the house! There is much work of this type. I shall keep you on it from now on. I am feeling faint -- I would take the air. I do not trust you, dog. There is something in your way that bothers me. Keep at those books! Sit! Carlos! Cholo! Sí, señor? Watch this one while he works with the books. My hands, señor. "Don Miguel," wretch! Don Miguel, my hands are soiled. I would clean them before marring these books. Let him clean them. Then back to the books. Where is thy master? I have yet to meet him. Don't jest me, big one. Where is Don Ricardo? The overseer sent only me. Here, take these. I prefer my hands. Listen, nasty brute -- we expected Don Ricardo, luera is here, on the patio! You wish me to take his ears? No, use thine own. The scheme dorothea planned has failed, so go to the Rose vines and trim them. Keep thy great ears open and report to Don Ricardo what you hear. What nature of man are you? In a moment of peril to Don Ricardo and thyself you make sport! Food and fight is all I have ever lived for. But I think there is something I missed, no? Go to the Rose vines, and watch out for thorns! Dorothea, listen to me. My blood has been on fire from the first time I came from the south. I'm sworn to Don Ricardo -- you know that. But he is dead, there is nothing for you in this perpetual grieving. Let me post the bands at the mission, and we will order a fiesta. Meat and wine for the peons of both ranchos. Be gone, vermin. I spoke to you! I sent for him to trim the roses. The other laborer could not come, señorita. He will work later? As soon as he can get free. Dorothea, is this gardening so important? Don Ricardo planted the roses for me. I tend them with every care. But I must speak to you in private -- this filthy wretch will carry our words into mudhouses. You! Go to some other task! I do not take orders from you. You dare address an hidalgo? I'll have you killed for this! Please, señor luera. But he spoke to me! You are not my meat -- I am keeping you for a better man. Stop, lugo, stop! I am preserving you, fop! Go, please go! There are servants here who will do his bidding. Bracero! Bracero! You great dumb ox! You would stay and fight a score of men? Aye, a thousand! Seek Don Ricardo, bring him back at all costs. Braceros! Braceros! Tear the dog to pieces! [ Bell rings loudly ] Run! He'll have the whole countryside up in arms! [ Hears bell ringing ] Trouble at rancho camino! [ Hears luera screaming ] You take care of this one! Sí. [ Gunshot ] Blueblood, I was coming back for you. Was it you who stirred up that hornets' nest? What did you do? I just slapped luera a time or two. But don't worry, I saved most of him for you. Luera's cutthroats are all looking for US now, you blundering ox! There's one chance left. Who asked for more? [ Hounds baying ] The hounds are after US now! It is your track they follow, blueblood. Come! The swine just passed here! Whip those dogs! It will be dark soon. There they are! See them? [ Barking ] Sanctuary, good father. Until I catch my breath. Come. In here. Sanctuary has been pleaded here. Here, let there be peace. Those two murdering peons are wanted by Don luera. Then bring your master. Sanctuary may not be broken without proof by law of a serious crime. Now go, my children. All of you, go in peace. Aachoo! [ Knocking ] Come in. I did not wish to disturb you. I was merely resting. What has happened? They met, as I suspected. Lugo and Manuel, they shook off the dogs. Again, we found their trail, but they got clear and found sanctuary in the mission. Sanctuary? This pair?! Where did you get them? A letter of recommendation from father Carlos. I do not like this business, porcareno. It has the earmarks of no ordinary revolt of the peons. My peons don't revolt -- these two were strangers. Probably wanderers. Ah, it matters nothing. Both must be killed. That stupid friar, giving sanctuary to swine who dare to strike a Don! Sí, hidalgo. Be gone, porcareno. Braceros,horses. You know better than this, friar -- where are these peons? They claimed sanctuary. You extended it, your good offices have been fulfilled. A capital offense has been committed -- one of them struck me! Striking you is a capital offense against the king's law. In the eyes of the church, it is only a misdemeanor. It is not for you, father, to interpret the law. I demand -- [ Astonished: ] Ricardo! You defile the name of your own mother. I'll run you though and put and end to this now! Stay your hand. This is sacred ground. Sergeant Garcia! In the name of the king, you are under arrest. Arrest?! Me?! For what! I was sent by the alcalde, señor. Proof has been gathered here of the thefts of two ranchos. A captain Martinez spoke freely about the threat of hot irons. Do you submit to arrest? I demand the right of an hidalgo, the privilege of combat to one of my blood. Sergeant Garcia, I offer him the challenge. As you wish. Choose your terms. Swords. Place? Time? In the gardens outside the mission wall at high noon. This soil is parched for the blood of such as thee. Seconds? Alone, without seconds, padre,or physician... To the death! Why meet your adversary alone, my son? His was the choice of terms, good father. I like this not at all. [ Banging ] [ Yelling ] Who locked me in? I did, amigo, while you slept. You? You strain the bonds of friendship beyond repair. Never have I been in a worse jail! It was necessary, you dumb ox. Luera and porcareno were here. Porcareno! Listen, amigo, it will take more than that priestly jail to keep me from his throat. There are certain niceties of law in combat that you will never understand. Had you been loosed at porcareno's throat, my plan would have failed. I meet luera at high noon in legal combat. I've heard too many promises, blueblood -- you've lost yourself a partner. Lugo, listen! Preach me one of thy laws and politics, my fingers itch! Fate has dealt me harshly, father. I've lost a good friend. Have at you, cousin! Recover thy blade, luera. If there's a prayer in you, utter it. To win! Leave him to me, dog, he's mine! Blueblood, I am here! Tear the swine to pieces! Roust thyself, blueblood! Choose, cousin -- death or dishonor? Life, Ricardo, life! Let me live! Sergeant Garcia, take him away. Thank you, Ricardo. 'Tis better this way, Ricardo. I will cook you a paté that will make you drool! Food and fight is all I have ever asked. But, ah... I fear me, woman, there is something I have missed. Father, post the bands. [ Laughing ] Let the mission bells announce the posting of our bands, good father. The peons of both ranchos shall be guests of honor at our wedding. [ Music playing ]
