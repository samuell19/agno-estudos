Don't keep doing that, you sound like a seal. - Get a drink of water. Stop that noise! If the landlord finds out we've got a dog he'll throw us out. Shh! Where's that dog? - What dog? - You know what dog! I heard it barking! My friend, Mr Laurel, has the hiccoughs. Aha! - What you going to do with him? - You know my rules about dogs! I'm gonna throw him out! On a night like this?! Listen, if I wasn't so kind-hearted I'd throw you out too! Now get to bed! Poor little Laughing Gravy. Go on! Get! Go on! - Where are you going? - I'm going to get my dog. You've gotten us into enough trouble. I'll do it. - I'm locked out. - I'll come down and let you in. No, no, no! The landlord'll hear you. Tie two sheets together and pull me up. OK. Get away from here you little mutt! Go on! What happened? Wait there. Open this door! - Hide the dog. - Open this door! Not there! This way! - Open this door! - Up the chimney! - No, not you! - Open this door! - Are you gonna open this door?! - Open the door! That settles it. Out you go the first thing in the morning. Bag and baggage. You get me? You climb up and get him and hand him down. And don't let him bark. Pass him to me through the window. Hey! Pull me up! - What's the matter? - I'm stuck. Do something to help me. Now look at us. We'll have to take a bath before we go to bed. What about Laughing Gravy? We'll wash him first. Come in! Now you've done it! If you're not out of here in 15 minutes I'll send for the cops! So help me Bob! This is the straw that broke the camel's back. What's the matter? What's the matter? You're the cause of me being in this deplorable condition! You've held me back for years and I'm sick of it! We're packing. Here's a letter for you. - Good night! - Good night. What's that? A letter. Who is it from? A friend. What's it about? It's about me. Is it good news or bad news? Yes and no. What do you mean, "yes and no"? 'Tis and it isn't. "'Tis and it isn't"? Uh-huh and uh-uh. Oh! You're getting on my nerves. Let me see that letter! - I will not! - Why? - It's private. - Oh... Well, if you feel that way about it, that settles it. I'm not interested in your affairs. Far be it from me to read your private mail. With me it's a closed book. Finis. Never bring up the matter again. It's private. Well, if it's private, it's private. But what I can't understand is having it private! Thank goodness it's not in my nature to hold out anything on a pal. That's one thing they can never say about me, that I ever held anything private from a friend. No, sirree. Once a friend always a friend. It's 50:50 with a Hardy. But then... it takes all sorts of people to make a world. It's all right, don't worry, I'll never complain. If it's private, it's private. % You'll be sorry just too late % When our friendship turns to hate % When our friendship turns to hate % You'll be sorry just too late % Doo-roo-ee, doo-doo to hate % You'll be sorry just too late % When our friendship turns to hate % You'll be sorry just too late % You'll be sorry just too late % When our friendship turns to hate % When our friendship turns to hate % When our friendship turns to hate... % What? Me read your letter? I should say not. - But Ollie... - Don't coax me. No Hardy would ever read anyone's personal, private mail. Absolutely not. All right. Give me that letter! Oh... holding out on me, huh? 'Twas ever thus. Oh! So we've come into a fortune, have we? Now I know why you didn't want me to read it. I'm sorry for everything I said. And I thought all the time it was you holding me back. Isn't it funny? We never see ourselves as others see us. Well, you better be going. What's going to become of you? Oh, don't worry about me, I'll be all right. Goodbye. Bye. And good luck. You're not gonna strip me of everything, are you? It's gonna be lonesome enough without you taking the dog. Goodbye. Goodbye. My pal! And to think, you're giving it all up for me. For you? I didn't want to leave Laughing Gravy. Get out of here and make it snappy. Wait a minute. This house is under quarantine. No one can leave here for two months. - Two months? - Two months. This is more than I can stand.
