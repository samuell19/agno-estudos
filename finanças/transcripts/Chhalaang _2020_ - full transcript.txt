Montu! Montu! - Montu! - Hmm? Wake up now. You'll miss the assembly. Five minutes more. I said you'll miss the assembly. Aren't you going to teach PT (Physical Training) today? Bablu will handle it. Anyway, he gets it done every day. It's not like doing PT will help them become Bill Gates. Who? What are you doing? Make them who? Ambani, Mom. Haven't you heard... All play and no work makes Jack a dumb boy. Drop it This is Sehwag's Haryana. You know how many gold medals Haryana's athletes win? Yet you mentioned a cricketer. Can you list any gold-winning athletes? And Sehwag isn't from Haryana. He's from Najafgarh, Delhi. I'm concerned about these kids' future, that's why I don't waste their time with fun and games. Just wake up! I have to boil the milk. - Mom! - Wake up. At least shut the door. Good morning, Mr. Lawyer. Good morning. Good morning, Aunty. I'm not your aunty. You forget that you were Montu's teacher. You are his Uncle! Having young friends won't make you young. What's got you so grumpy this morning? And having older friends won't make you any wiser. Come on, Mr. Lawyer. What can you except from someone who has such a dufus for a teacher? And on top of that a bachelor still. Didn't get married himself and now isn't letting my son get married. Mr. Lawyer, tell Aunty not to get personal. I'm not a bachelor. I'm a widow. Randawa. What? Mister, you are a Randawa. Go and tell this tale to someone else, Shukla. The truth is you are the one who has spoilt Montu. Otherwise, he would've at least been a subject teacher by now. Of course. His mother also says Montu has spoilt Shukla, otherwise he would have been a professor by now. Right. His mother addresses him as Shukla? No. - Come on, Mom. - That's just crossing the line. What's this, man? You are wearing shorts again? At least get yourself a decent pair of pants made. Why? When I can get two shorts made for the price of one pair of pants? I'm saving money. - Right, Dad? - Yeah. - Look here Shukla. - Yeah. Ran-Da-Wa. A man whose wife is either dead or has left him. Hold on. Where does it say, 'or has left him'? Well, some things are not mentioned in here. They are stated up here. Aunty! Make some stuffed flatbreads so that we can get going. I'll smack him with my slippers if he calls me aunty one more time. I'm telling you. You keep saying it, but you never act on it. I'll do it also. Look, in English it means widower. A man who has lost his wife. Yeah, so widower sounds better. But honestly, Randawa suits you better. Dad, you aren't ready yet? Don't you have to go to work? Court opens at nine. But the kids must be lining up to hitch a ride with you. Let's go, Shukla Ji. - My lunch, Mom? - I'm dying to get out of here. Talk some sense into him. Bye, Aunty! - I'll break your jaw. - You'll get beat up. Ran-Da-Wa. Wow. Morning, Madam. Is this the way to enter? Did you measure that? - And the length? - Yes. Hold here. May I come in, Madam? Yes, come in. Morning, Madam. What's this morning business? Everyone knows that it's morning. Are you too lazy to add 'good' before it, Montu? Mahinder. "Mahinder!" I've known him since he was this big, running around the school in shorts. Look at him. What impression will people form of the teachers in this school? Where's the register? I need to mark my attendance. You get marked present only if you show up on time. Then mark me absent. I'm going back home. Go ahead. I will cut your salary. I'm allowed paid leaves by the Ministry. You have already exhausted your paid leaves, kiddo. When? Check the register. You didn't come at all last week. Where is your signature? Show me! Why do you need the signature? Didn't I meet you every day last week? Who showed the school to the wedding party on Monday? Who finalized their booking on Tuesday? Who got your car serviced on Wednesday? And who decided the area for the wedding ceremony on Friday? But you get paid according to what this register says. And the register says that... Come on, Madam. Since when can the register speak for itself? Have you had a drink this early in the morning...? I think you should let the register make the arrangements for the next wedding. It will 'talk' to everybody. Montu. This is not right, Madam. You are doing this just to give me a pay cut. Here I'm thinking about coming up with a fake holiday. So that we don't lose the booking on Thursday. And you are bothering about such trivial things. - Where are the mattresses? - What? What will the guests think when they'll see old torn mattresses? I'm the one who won't get the full payment. I'm the one who'll suffer a loss. Who will get the mattresses? Yes, who will get the mattresses? That's what I'm asking, who will get the mattresses? You'll get the mattresses! Keep it steady like this. I have to say, Usha is very dynamic. I mean when we were young, then also. That's why she's the principal, man. Anyway, talking about the past won't do us any good. Sir, can I get a new leather ball? Its stitches are coming off. Hey Specky. Yes, sir? That one, shorty. Play a little. If you keep your head buried in books all day, you'll soon have to replace those glasses with binoculars. Sir, if I finish my homework now... I can begin with next term's syllabus when I get home. Take notes from him. Want a new ball, huh. Go and study instead. And listen, where's Bablu? Busy playing hopscotch, with Pinky. Romance is going to make these boys soft and their cheeks go pink. Jump to two. Yes! Come, let's play some Cricket. This kid has become a Casanova. Come on, come on, come on, sir. Wear a helmet, Shukla Ji. You're about to face the Jajjhar Express. Montu! Listen up, man. I'm lagging behind with the syllabus of ninth and tenth grade. I want your classes today. Go on, they are all yours. - Thank you. - Have fun. - Get aside! - Dimpy! Hey Dimpy! Shukla Ji, try this sauce. I watched a Masterchef video on YouTube and made it. - Really? - Yeah. Dimwit, you are just a cook. Watching a Masterchef video on YouTube and making a sauce doesn't make anyone a chef. True. The name of the shop is Chautala and Sons, so that makes me its chef. You are a cook. And the name of the shop is Chautala and Sons, not grandson. True. - Chotu. - Yes, sir? Hold their fritters' order. They have had enough. It's time for them to go home. - Oh, you felt bad about what I said. - No, I didn't. Fine, I accept that you are Chautala and Sons. Shukla Ji, he's Chautala and Sons. - Yes, given. - Call for the fritters. And? And what? Oh chef. I accept you are a chef, bro. You are the best chef in town. Please get them. - Chotu. - Yes, sir? Get them. Look, you've given two each. Call for some sweets as well. Shukla Ji, you are a limit. Why don't you come once and gobble everything up? Hello? Why do you get upset over such petty things? - I'm not getting upset. - What are you saying? Slow down. - You're very dear to me - What? Chotu, listen up. - Give Shukla Ji whatever... - Where? You want to become a lover boy? - Yeah I want to. What will you do? - Leave me, leave me - What will you do, what will you do? - Get aside, get aside. Ask him what happened. He just came and started hitting me. - They are acting like wild dogs. - Calm down. - What happened? - He wants to be a lover boy. He's just a kid, drop it. Tell me, what will you do about it, huh? You won't say anything because he is here now? I'll talk to him. Who slapped him? You... Hey, watch it! Hey, listen up! You... Listen to me. - Give him a good beating. - How much for these eggplants? - 20 bucks a kilo. Weigh them in. We won't spare you. - Pay up, Sir. - Get out of my way! Hey. Mister, what are you looking at? Give me a second. Hold on. Hang on for just a second. Will anyone tell me what's happened? Huh? Sir, his brother was planning to elope with our daughter. - Yes. - What are you saying, Uncle? He doesn't even have enough money to hire a rickshaw, how can he elope with your daughter? Oh really! Then ask him,... what was he doing in the vegetable market with our daughter? What were you doing? Having an ice candy. Heard that? Can't kids have an ice candy? How does eating ice candy lead to eloping? No, the issue isn't that they were having an ice candy. Yes. The issue is that they were sharing an ice candy. Yes, they were sharing it. You two were sharing it? We only had money to buy one. That's why we got the one with mixed flavours, Wild Berry and Orange. You see that? Wild Berry? Pinky likes it. Look at that, he's being cheesy again. Calm down. Hang on a second. Listen to me, Uncle. Please just hear me out. Your daughter too was having the ice candy, right? So? She is the one who asked for Wild Berry. Huh? He still prefers Orange. - He's just a kid. - Huh? Tell me something, how can someone who still enjoys Orange elope with someone who likes Wild Berry? I mean it's clear from the flavour choices as to who would think of eloping. How do the flavours matter in this? You cannot compare Wild Berry with Orange - This is not right. - You are a grown up. - Listen to me. - Calm down. Hang on. I guarantee that from now on our boy won't share, an ice candy with anyone's daughter let alone yours. - You are taking me lightly, Sir. - This is a limit. You have no respect for me only - Escort them out of here - You think this is a joke? - I won't let this go so easily. - Do whatever you can. Why are you doing this? Drop it. Give me that one. It has double ghee in it, right? Here, take 50%. I think I'll only get to eat food cooked by me till the day I die. I've got him over a dozen marriage proposals. But he keeps rejecting everyone. I've fixed a meeting for tomorrow as well. How can I get married like this? This isn't how it's done. Meeting's fixed on a Sunday, the girl and boy meet, have snacks, act shy, have some small talk, smile, say yes, get the invites printed, call your family, book a DJ, the groom gets on a horse and boom, you are married. This isn't how marriages are done. This is exactly how they're done. How else are they done? This is how I got married. This is how Dara Singh got married. And this is how you will get married. Dad, how can you get to know in the first meeting, whether your tuning matches with that of the girl or not? Son, you should have mentioned that sooner. No problem. I'll ask them to send their daughter to our place for a couple of months, so that our son can match his tuning with hers. Really? Dimwit. I'm warning you, I'll confirm the match this Sunday. - Why do you keep hitting me? - Always does as he pleases. Exactly. I have also watched the movie, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun. I also want to be like Salman Khan. Of course, you are Salman Khan and I'm his elder brother. And your face looks like their dog Tuffy. Son? No, you don't look like Salman Khan. I'm warning you, I'll confirm the match this Sunday. I'm telling you, I won't go anywhere. I'm very busy. And what are you busy with? 'Come, let's celebrate the day of love.' Get them. Get that donkey. Get down, Romeo. Get down, I said. Get him. Get him. Get that one as well. Get that Sardar as well. Let's make them celebrate Valentine's day. Turn his backside red. Take them away. They all want to be lover boys. They are getting romantic, huh? Come on. Sit down. Oh no. Take a picture. Click their pictures. Let's go. No, no. Just relax. Click their pictures. Remain seated. Sonu, Dimpy, come with me. - What happened? - Let's go. Look at this. Oldies are acting romantic, huh? Really Uncle, you've eloped at this age? She's the wife. Whose? Who are you? And what is this nonsense? Oh! So you're the ones who're frolicking around in the park and we're being indecent? Watch it. Mind your tongue. Don't you have parents? - I do. - Then? But they do such things in the privacy of a home and not in a park. Don't you have Indian values instilled in you? You are going around with such a young girl at this age? She's my wife. She's 10 years younger than me. What's the proof that she's your wife? We have a daughter together, a live proof. - Right. - First take your hand off her. Take your hand off and give me the proof. - Make him talk to her over the phone. - Okay. Fine, let me talk to her. We come from a decent family. Put the decency on speaker. There you go. Yes, Dad? Your dad was caught in Buddha Garden with a woman. A woman? Who? - Dad? - It's me. - Mom? - This woman. Who are you? She is my mother. See? My name is Montu. And it's my job to put a stop to this westernized tradition of romance. What is this nonsense? It's your dad who is acting cheap here. You too should feel ashamed for letting your dad... Hang on a second. How do we know whether she's really your daughter or not? - This is not done. - Keep your phone back in your pocket. No, this is. - Time to make him famous. - Dad. - Click their picture. - You dial 100 on your phone. I'm coming there - Do you want me to punch you? - This is not right. - Come on, click their picture. - Let him go. - Brother. - Stand next to him. - Look there. - Let him go. - Stand next to him. Take a step closer. - Look there. - We are decent people. - Let him go. - Smile, Dimpy. - Yeah. Isn't that awesome, Shukla Ji? Montu, I think it's time you start preparing for politics. What are you saying? What am I saying? You think I have it in me? Of course, hundred percent. Don't do you think so, Kode Sir? Absolutely, Shukla Ji. - Right. - This is our staff room. That's Sunil Sir. He teaches Science. And this is Mrs. Sushila. She teaches Geography. That's Mr. Kapoor. He teaches Mathematics. This is our senior most teacher, Shukla Ji. He teaches Hindi. Madam? And this is our talented PTI (Physical Training Instructor), Montu. Mahinder. Myself, Mahinder Hooda. Meet Ms. Neelima. She'll be teaching Computers from today. Okay. - Hello. - Usha is so young at heart. So, Computers? Montu, isn't this your picture in the newspaper? I just noticed it. - Yes. - You've made the headlines. - Come on, Shukla Ji. - No, it's great. My picture got printed. Great picture. Thank you. Of my parents. Yesterday, a worthless local goon troubled them in the park. I even spoke to him over the phone. He said his name was Montu or something. Honestly, I felt like slapping him through the phone. Now I think I shouldn't bother. I will dirty my own hands. But I do pity the students here. With such goon like teachers around, what will become of them? Being cheap is one thing, but being proud of that fact is a big thing. Wow! Why didn't you tell her that her mom looked hot, and her dad looked like an old pot, so you got confused. Anyone can get confused. It's not a big... Where are you going? Ms. Neelima. Ms. Neelima, I... Go home. Hey, take your notebook with you. I wanted to talk to you. - Yes, Mr. Mahinder? - Montu. It was a misunderstanding, the other day. Your parents were in the park, so I thought that... You know girls and boys go there to do indecent things. And people don't act their age these days, so... Sorry. Are you apologizing or justifying yourself? Don't apologize if you are justifying it. And don't justify if you are apologizing. And I can understand your need to apologize. You are apologizing because I look good. If I didn't look good, you wouldn't have even thought about it, let alone apologize. Keep your apology to yourself. I don't need it. But... What wrong things do girls and boys do in the park? And who are you to decide how they should behave? To love each other, to like each other, to sit together, to hold hands... Are these things illegal? You won't hold the hand of the person you like? - Please... - You won't sit with her? So, where will you take her? To your home or to a hotel? Do you know what your problem is? The Holier Than Thou Complex. You cannot be a decent human being but you have an ego fit for a God. I couldn't hear anything. But I could feel the insult from afar. I'm sure she must have drawn blood. Turn around, let me check. Hey. It's nothing. We were just talking. It's a little... Let's go. I have to say, it is her father's fault. He got married to someone so much younger. It's okay, I understand, there can be misunderstandings. But being so insulting is not justified, my friend. You are right. Tell me, what did we do wrong? Just maligned her parents' character in front of a few people. Just got their picture printed in the newspaper which damaged their reputation in the city. What is the big deal? Right. It is so not right to get angry over such a petty thing. Right? Right. So she is rude and what you made me do is a lesson in doing the right thing. What I made you do? You are so duplicitous. I was justifying your actions, so that I can give you some moral support. - But you... - I don't want your support. I don't want your morals either. You can have them. She is right and we are wrong. She has a right to abuse me. Yesterday, we learnt how to make a document in Word. Remember? Yes, Ma'am. Today, we will learn how to rename that same document. Okay? Good morning, Sir. Sit down. Thank you, Sir. Good morning, Ms. Neelima. Yes, Sir? Do you need anything? No, I was just taking a round... What have you done? I haven't done anything, Sir. - Don't try to be a rockstar! - Hey. No one dare trouble madam. Understood? - Hold your ears. - Hey. Mr. Mahinder. I can handle my students myself. If you misbehave or raise your hand on them again, I'll file a complaint directly with the Education Board and not the Principal. - Madam, you... - Out. Really? Let me know if anybody misbehaves. Hold your ears. Hands down. Do as madam says. Do it. Where were we? You'll have lunch in the staff room? No, in the Principal's office. Okay. Bablu! What are you doing? Is this how I've taught you to play a square cut? Huh? In the future when you'll play for India in the World Cup, will you embarrass us all? But Sir, this is how you have taught me to play. And how can I play a leg side ball towards square? Stop stupidness. No debate competition. Go here. Go. Look over here. Everyone see how it's done. Everyone, eyes over here. Come on Piyush. Keep it on off side, short ball. Okay? For a square cut. And Piyush, listen. Fast paced. Okay? Overpitched. First take your stance and keep your eyes on the ball. What a shot, Sir! Amazing! What a shot, Sir! What a shot Sir! This was overpitched. If you bowl like this, anyone would hit a six. What did I say? Short ball. No problem, try again. Come on. Off side, short ball, okay? Do as I had instructed before. Okay? Come on, Son. Very good bowling. I've taught you well. Saw that? Take notes. - Sorry, Sir. - Just like Bumrah Very good son. Very good. Your turn now. Very good. Carry on. I got out on purpose, to boost his confidence. Carry on. So from Mahinder Sir's dismissal we learn that, you shouldn't decide the shot beforehand. You should decide the shot after you have judged the ball. There are some deliveries that you don't hit, you defend otherwise, you end up losing your wicket. "I find myself lost in the web of your eyes" "Oh baby, Without even asking I'm yours" "I so want to touch your rosy cheeks" "I seek your permission today, please" "You secretly keep looking at me" "Come on, it's time you confess openly" "I keep apologizing for no reason" "Oh your stealthiness." "Your tantrums are as big as mountains" "I'm tired of counting, your multiple facets" "Your tantrums are as big as mountains" "I'm tired of counting, your multiple facets" "I think of you the whole day" "I have forgotten everyone else in this world" "I have rejected so many girls for you..." "Oh your stealthiness." Oh! Hey, you... Ms. Neelima, I wanted to talk to you. About what? - Well... - You want to apologize? You have understood your mistake? You feel embarrassed? You have mended your ways? You won't do such a thing every again? You want to be my friend? Yes. Buy me a drink? Is that a yes or a no? No, yes. Yes. Six in the evening today. Two lanes after Shaheed Park. Shaheed Park. Drinks! Mom? Yeah? Where's the seat kept? - Which seat? - The pillion seat. It was removed. I know that. But where did you keep it. Your dad would know. Listen? Listen? Where's the seat? I removed it. I know that. Montu wants to know where have you kept it. Why? I want to put it back. But I don't want to. Dad, I need to go somewhere and I want it. You can take it off later. But why do you need the seat? I need to take someone along Dad. Please just tell me, where have you kept it? It's none of your business. Mom... Ask the one who is going with you to get a pillow. - I cannot do that! - Oh, come on. - Found it? - So tell me, where do we meet? Crawl into your phone only one day. Find it! You should call for a pillow. Look behind that basket. It's not here, brother. Get down, Bablu. I'll find it, Dad. Get down, son. You will get hurt if you fall. He can also end up with a splinter in his backside. As if he'll die if a splinter pricks him. Let him get hurt Find it. Wait a minute What are you doing? What are you doing, Dad? Let me climb up. Very good. He jumps well. - Be careful. - Hold the ladder. There are rats up there. - I'll check. - It's all because of brother. The ladder is creaking, please get down. Found it. - Found it. - Give it here. Here, found it. Hold it steady. I only look fat. Inside it's just gas. Very good. Rats are really a nuisance. They nibbled on the seat. Wait, it will start. Can you give it a slight push? Let it go when I ask you to. Let it go now. Come. Yeah, come this way. Happy birthday... That's Dimpy, Shukla Ji... So how did you like it? The arrangement? Is this where you drink every day? In a secluded corner? No. I'm sure you must be having it in the open, unabashed. Of course. But you can't with me. No. I mean it's not... Don't you have any other place? Of course, we do. Fully air. Just five minutes. Cheers? Cheers. Ms. Neelu, you... Sir, please don't be so formal with me. Neelu, you have studied from Delhi. Then how did you end up becoming a teacher? Why? Is being a teacher not a good thing? Well... As a student, I used to teach computers to cover my expenses. I started enjoying teaching. So, I became a teacher. Oh, I see. Do you like kids? Yes. Why did you become a PTI? I actually wanted to pursue law but couldn't really do it. Then everyone suggested that I should get a degree in Education. I thought it wasn't my cup of tea. So then, Dad made a call to Usha Madam and got me this PTI job. My dad has great connections. Neelu, they say those who can't do, teach. And those who can't teach, become PTIs. Shukla Ji... So you have no interest in physical education? It is important for the kids. No, it's not that I am not interested in it. You see Neelu, here... - Ms. Neelima, no one here is... - Neelu is fine. - Ms. Neelu, no one here is... - Just Neelu. Just? Neelu, no one here is interested in sports or physical education. So even I'm laid-back about it..... But I'm quite concerned about it even if no one else is. When I saw the state of the kids in the school... the passion inside me came to life. Like you. Well said. After all, our student's future is at stake. Right? All rubbish. You are such a fraud. Make me another drink. I have to say, she is honest. By the way, I too like kids a lot. You know my lane also. Yes, thanks to Shukla Ji. Shukla Ji is smart. I think I should befriend him only. Come on. Okay, good night. Good night. Neelu? I apologize for the other day. It's not okay, but it's okay. Bye. Feels good, doesn't it? Very good. You must be feeling this sheer joy within? You must be wondering when the sun would rise, so that you can see her again. Concentrate on your studies. I speak from experience. You better make a move. Such girls don't stay single for long. You should propose to her. If someone else steps in, your love story will become a love triangle. Or else, you'll be left blushing and someone else will sweep her off her feet Who can dare to take her away from me now? Sister-in-law, hmmm? Come on now, switch off the light. Why don't you ever listen to me? Not the waist, not the waist. Good. Don't move your hands like this. Keep your hands straight. What's this? What does it look like to you? That someone is conducting a sports class. And who usually does that? PTI. But I'm the PTI. That's what you think. No, Usha can't do that. Singh Sir, Principal Madam has summoned you. Singh Sir? Montu, you too. It's Mahinder. Whatever, Mahinder. Singh Sir. Hold this, hold this, hold this. Shukla Ji, hold this. May I come in, Madam? - Please come in, Singh Sir. - Hello. Please come in and have a seat. Good morning, Madam. Montu, have you met him? I.M. Singh. I'm Hooda. Inder Mohan Singh. And he's Montu. From today, you will have to assist Singh Sir. Why do I have to assist him? What do you mean by why? We got a notification from the state government, that from today onwards sports will be a compulsory subject. Those schools whose students perform well in sports at the state level, will get a grant from the government. It's my dream that a new wing opens here before I retire,... and Sir Choturam Secondary School becomes Senior Secondary School. But even I can teach the students, Madam. But Montu, Singh Sir graduated from Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports, Patiala. - Did I get that right? - Yes. He is qualified. He is experienced. You'll learn a lot if you'll work with him. Where are you from? Here only. Behind the vegetable market. No, I mean where did you get your education from? He's is an ex student of this school only. Okay. He's like a son to me. His father called me and asked whether I could help him out. There was a vacancy so I hired him. And thus, he became a PTI. This is what is happening everywhere across the country. Most people don't know, you actually require a degree to become a PTI. Anyway, this situation too shall change slowly. We will change it. We surely will. I have another qualification. I have competed at the state level, in Athletics. It's okay, not everyone can make the cut. But we will make sure that our students do. Madam, can I have a word with you, in private? I'll get going. I have just had one class with some students. They are very weak. But I'll see how the other students fare. See you around. This is not fair, Madam. How can you give my job to someone else? That too without asking me. What do you mean without asking? I didn't give him your job. I haven't fired you. Don't worry. Your salary will remain the same. And you will also get extra commission for the weddings. After all, you will be the one handling them. You anyway didn't take the coaching seriously. But... The thing is madam, I'm giving you one week. If you still think that he should be the PTI then I'll resign. You can make him handle the weddings too. He'll only get the mattresses for you. Netaji Subhash Patiala! Tell me, will there be a pay cut? Then what's the problem? You'll get the salary of a PTI with the work profile of an assistant. Listen, let's have him kidnapped. And then what will you do? Weightlifting? We can decide that after we abduct him. I'll slap him silly right here. Want me to break his bones? How about an accident? Wait, let me just call Nagar. Hey, you don't become a gangster just by watching gangster movies. You are just a cook. Don't forget your standing. No problem. We'll feed him laxative laced food. - He'd have no option but to run. - Stop it. Zip it. I'll handle it. You leave it. Whatever. Bro, I have decided, I will talk to Usha. English. Shukla Ji, your fake confidence has already screwed up your life, now it'll screw up mine. Please do me a favour, take that fake confidence of yours and... As far as one's standing is concerned, I was a cook yesterday, and I'm one today. You were a PTI yesterday, who is just an assistant today. Hey. Bro, I have decided, I will not talk to Usha. Hey! What is wrong with both of you? - Madam? - Yes? Have you seen Neelu... Neelima Madam? No. - You haven't? - No. Move aside. - So I didn't come to the college only, otherwise.. - Oh. What are you two talking about? Hi, Montu. You know it's such a pleasant coincidence, Singh Sir is also a graduate of Kurukshetra University. He was my super senior. But we never bumped into each other. I regret missing out on that opportunity. I want to talk to you, in private. What is going on, Mr. Montu? You keep having a lot of private meetings, first Principal Madam and now Ms. Neelima. You'll soon have to start explaining yourself. Anyway, you guys carry on. - I'll see you later, Neelima? - Okay. I can call you Neelima, right? I'm your super senior. Call me Neelu. Okay, Neelu. So, what is it? What were you two talking about? Nothing. So? What? You wanted to talk to me. Right. What are your plans for this evening? Why? No, I wanted to talk to you. Then why not talk now? No, I don't want to hurry this up. Dinner? Dinner will be too late. Yes, dinner will be too late. Snacks then? Okay. Pick me up from the same place as last time at four. Hmm? Okay. I know a place that serves amazing snacks. But please don't tell Dimpy. He'll feel offended that I have snacks from somewhere else also. You are cute. Huh? Cute? Dimpy thinks I'm hot. Neelu, can I drop you home? Sure. - Come. - Let's go. Bye. I'll see you, Montu. Bye. -Shall we? - Do you know where I stay? Yes of course, I'm sure it must be on the way somewhere. It cannot be outside the town. So what were you and Singh talking about? You need to stop obsessing over it. Fine, I have some work. Please come with me. What is it? Just come with me. Welcome. Hello. - Please have a seat. - Sit. Please make yourself comfortable. - What would you like to see? - A ring. A diamond ring. I'm thinking about buying one for Mom. She keeps asking Dad for it so... a surprise. Okay. Her ring size? Her ring size? Mom's hands are just like yours. You should try them. I'll buy a size close to yours. Show them in her size. Have a look. No, not in this one, put it in that finger. Mom's married. How about this one? What have you thought about the job? Show me something more expensive. Why don't you try talking to Principal Madam again? It makes no difference to her. If it did, she would've talked to me before appointing Singh. It's just an excuse. She and I, we go way back. I don't want to work where I'm not respected. Respect comes first. You are just being negative. Why don't you assist him? Maybe it'll end up benefitting you. It's not like you'll need to change your visiting card from PTI to Assistant PTI. Salary too will remain the same. First get your job sorted, then you can buy the ring. For your mom. Let's go? We'll drop by later. Okay. Madam, I accept your offer. So tell me Coach Sir, what do I need to do? Keep doing it. Your legs need to move to the front and then back. Sir, you too should try it. It will loosen your muscles, help you warm up. Come on, do it. What are you doing? Huh? Who taught you this technique? Sir, Montu Sir. Never mind. Give me that. You are playing it like this. Okay? This could get you out because you're not in control of the shot. Lift your bat, place your leg in front, neck straight. The ball should go in the direction of your toe's tip. Got it? Come on, do it again. Your knees should touch your chest. Okay? Touch it. Do it properly. Sir, wait. Give me that. You can now do it comfortably. There will be no hindrances. Keep going. Grab him Navjot, grab him. Oh no. What are you doing? Your technique is all wrong. Who taught you this? What are you doing, Navjyot? Just hold his leg and bring him to the ground. Montu Sir... - Let me explain it to them. - Push him to the ground and tackle him. Montu Sir, I'll show it to them. Please come here. You too can watch and learn. Please stand here. Now watch me. Come here, kiddo. Now this is what you're doing. You're holding him like this. Leave. Run away. He can easily escape. Let's try it again. Here he comes, you shift and drag him in. Go. Got it? Got it, Sir? You see, we need to teach them right when they are young, otherwise, they'll never be able to play it right. Sir, please step outside the court, the game is on. Go for it again. Your hands go up completely. Come on, come on. Higher Sir, the kids are watching you. Come on, keep jumping. Everyone, keep jumping. Bablu, focus on the work, not the girl Otherwise, you'll end up losing both. I'm focusing on work only, Sir. Oh really? Attitude? Step back. Come on, run in and touch and then go back. Come on. What happened? You fell? Come on, get up. Try again. Come on. Try a toe touch, toe touch. Toe touch. Stop struggling and give up. No. Come on, give up. That's enough. When winning is beyond you, you should just accept defeat. He got your point, Sir. Let him go. Sir, I need to teach him how to lose gracefully. Moreover, a player should always know where he stands. And people here have massive egos. It's not a good thing for a sportsman to have. Don't worry, they will slowly lose it. Come on, give up. Get up. Get up. - Are you okay? Huh? - Yes. Yes, I am. Why are you dragging him into this? Why don't you come after me instead? What's all this? Why don't you ask him? He was venting his anger out on a kid. Why would I do that? I was teaching the students the way I know is right. He's the one holding a grudge. All the students are witness to the fact that he raised his hand on me for no reason. What is this nonsense, Montu? Apologize to Singh Sir, Now! Madam, I care for my job... ...but more for my self-respect. Hello, Uncle. You? What are you doing here? I wanted to talk to Neelu. Get out of here. Want to talk to Neelu! Get out! - Please let bygones be bygones. - Let bygones be bygones. I have already apologized to Neelu. So? - Neelu, you didn't tell him? - You are done apologizing, right? - Now get out of here. - Please hear me out. - Don't worry. - Go on. I'll keep your daughter very happy. You'll have grandchildren... Hello, Aunty. - How dare you... - At least hear me out. - I'll beat you up. - Fine, hit me and get it over with. - Just hit me. - Montu, don't. - I apologized. - Montu, zip it. Dad, I'll talk to him. You go inside. Go inside. Okay, it's okay. - Go inside. - It's okay. - Take him inside. - Sorry, Uncle. - I won't spare you, you dimwit. - Sorry, Aunty. - I wanted to talk... - What were you doing? What is this nonsense? Neelu, remember you had asked, "If you like someone, wouldn't you hold their hand?" "Won't you sit next to them?" "You'll take them home or to a hotel?" I'm not one of those who goes to hotels. I will respectfully take you home. I want to hold your hand so I've come to ask for your hand in marriage So what now? Should we go? Have kids? What else do you want? - What are you saying? - No, tell me. Don't you love me? Huh? Being in love and being open to the possibility of falling in love are two different things, Montu. I like you. I need more to be in love, Montu. What do you need? You need a job, a car, a home, money? Tell me and I'll get it. Montu, I don't want to lead a scrimpy existence because of your frivolous thinking. My frivolous thinking. My frivolous thinking, huh? I tolerated getting insulted every day at the job, only because of you. You were doing that also for me? Yes. Then quit your job. Quit it if you were doing it only for me. I already did. Very good. Now you should leave me as well. Because eventually that's what you are going to do. That's all you have ever done. Thank you. It's Scotch. A client had gifted it when I had won a case. I'd thought, I'll open it with you one day. But you always end up drinking with your friends. Come on, have a drink with me today. That's enough. Cheers. Montu, why are you getting upset? You can always take up another job. This is not the only one. And you should quit if you cannot do it. I should quit? I already did. I quit Cricket, when I didn't get selected for the under-15 team. I quit Science, when I found Physics to be difficult. I quit Athletics, when I didn't get selected for the State team. I quit Law Studies too, because of the hefty books. I always quit. You must be so proud of me, Dad. Now one could compete with your son when it came to quitting. I never lost... always abandoned. And game over. Son! There are at least 50 of them. 2000 with the 50... Good that you are here as well. Madam, you hired him because you think he is a better coach than me, right? Fine then. Choose any three sports. He can even form his team first. And after a month, let us have a sports competition. The winner keeps the job. Montu, this is not a game. Making such decisions isn't a joke. This is not a game for me either, Madam. This is not possible. I don't have any problem with it, Madam. That's not your decision to make. If he is saying that he doesn't have a problem with it then... No, one moment. Montu, hang on for a second. Please excuse us, I need to talk to her in private. Shukla Ji, this is not right. This is not right for the students. This is not right for the school. What will everyone think? They will make fun of us. I left this chair 18 years ago, the chair that you're sitting on today. Because back then I wasn't being able to get a hold of my life. You weren't the most senior. No one here wanted a woman to take this position. But I supported you. Sheila had just left me and yet I supported you. People had a lot to say back then as well. They had made fun of us even back then. But I... I supported you because you believed that you were capable for it. And I believed in your belief. And... you've handled it well, that too for 18 years. Look Usha, Montu was your student. An ex-student of this school. An ex-student of your own school. If you think, he isn't capable enough to win then so be it. But if you think, he isn't even capable enough to put up a fight, then you should think what that says about this school of yours. Basketball. 400-meter Relay Race. Kabaddi. Okay. Master Ji! Master Ji, did you think you would just waltz in here, and take away the job, the girl and the respect? Right? Master Ji, this is Haryana. Our town. This is not how it happens out here. Of course. In his own territory, even a dog acts like a lion. You are right. We are lions. Now get this. In our territory,... ...even outside lions are mere dogs. You're in the wrong neighbourhood Master. But I'll teach you as well, I'll teach you how to wag your tail. Hu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu... - Pratap Kumar. - Yes, Sir. - Biren Dariyan. - Sir. - Ravi Tomar. - Yes, Sir. I understand your need to challenge him. - Piyush Jhangra - Sir. But I don't understand why you let him form his team first. Sir, I'm sure he will play for your team, so I'll... No, Sir. You pick him if you think he is capable. He will play. For your team only. And he will put in his best effort. If he doesn't do that, let me know. Bablu Hooda. So Sir, this is my team. You should keep a copy, so that there's no confusion in the future. - Like I explained about the... - Excuse us, Sir. Hey, couch potato. You, the backbencher. Then take him as well. Yeah. We'll work it out. Team Montu! These three. Yeah, they are fine. And this one, Specky. Looks perfect. Both of you, stand up. Perfect. Meet me on the ground after class. - Let's go. - Wait a second, Montu. I think Lokesh will do well too. Fine, meet me on the ground after class. So, what all games do you guys play? Sir, Seven Stones. Sir, Ludo. Sir, Temple Run. What run? Temple Run, Sir. That mobile phone game. Obviously. From amongst you all we will be forming three teams. Relay Race, Basketball and Kabaddi. Sir, I need to prepare for the Olympiad. It's Olympics, not Olympiad, kiddo. Let us first win the school's competition, then I'll take you to Olympics, okay? Not Olympics, Olympiad sir. Maths Olympiad. Ssshhh. Montu, I must say, you are very generous. You handed the creme de la creme of the school to Singh. Now he'll enjoy full cream milk while you'll be stuck with double toned milk Bro, I always say, this over inflated ego is never a good thing. You need to be a little practical as well. I mean his pride is twice his size. What do you expect will happen? His pride is bound to crush him. Hey... It is this fake confidence of yours that has screwed up everything for you. Now it's your turn to take your fake confidence and... Fine, even if because of my ego I let him form his team first, he should have at least had the courtesy to keep the competition fair. Finally, you have at least accepted defeat. I haven't accepted defeat. But this competition is unfair. And Neelu cannot see that. Should I ask Neelu to talk to Singh into giving me four students? He won't be able to say no to Neelu. What say? The way you fluctuate between being a hero and a dimwit blows my mind away. Four days ago, you were walking around with your chest brimming with pride. He was making tall claims about domesticating a lion. And now, when Neelu is concerned he has resorted to begging. You are one confused man, a confused man. Shukla Ji. Sir, Neelu has already chosen the pillion seat of his bike. So you might as well forget about your love story. Try to give him a tough competition in at least one of the games. You might perhaps be able to save your job. Neelu, sister-in-law. That's right, it's time you start referring to Singh as your elder brother. Are you both on his team or mine? Move aside, what's taking you so long? Can't you be patient? Fine, have it! He wants to drink water. How are you doing boys? How's the training going? I hope Singh Sir's not being too strict. He's treating you guys as nicely I used to. Right? Ravi? Yes, Sir. He got a new basketball issued today. Asked me to take it home. He also asked us to make a list of our shoe sizes. Amazing. Basketball, shoes. So Singh Sir is only doing everything, and I never did anything for you all? Don't feel bad Sir. We will surely play for your team next year. But will you be there next year? Well done. So this is the love left in a student's heart for his favourite teacher now? Back in our time, a student-teacher relationship would last a lifetime. Take Shukla Ji and me for example. How close we are. And look at yourselves. What should we look at? You are the one who handed us over to him. Even if I did, couldn't you have refused and said you wanted to play for me? Huh? You didn't feel ashamed standing next to him? Didn't your soul hurt at the thought, that you'll be wearing a jersey with his name on it? Singh? Mine did. I couldn't have borne the thought that he calls you his team. And you call him your coach. I swear, if I had been in your place, and I was given the best team in the world, I would have said no. Because this is my team, my students. You guys don't have the courage to go to Principal Madam, and say that you'd like to play for my team. For your favourite teacher's team. Fine. Sir. May I come in Ma'... Yes, Montu? What are they doing here? Madam, we are here to say that... They want to change their team, Madam. They're saying, "We love you Montu Sir." "We want to play for your team and not for Singh Sirs'." I'm tired of explaining it to them. They just wouldn't listen. They are acting like emotional fools. Madam, please talk some sense into them. Tell them that it is not possible. Fools, love and ethics are two different things. Right? Please don't listen to them. Please don't. You cannot do that. You will have to play for Singh Sir's team. If you do anything stupid, then you'll be out of the competition. - Heard that? - That's what we have been trying to say, Ma'am. Madam already said it. Didn't you hear it? Now go, go play for Singh Sir's team. - Get moving. - Okay, Sir. - He too needs good players. - Yes. Go practice. Very good, very good. - Emotional fools - How mature of you, Montu. Come on, Madam. That was amazing, Mr. Mahinder. Respect! Cheating may be fair in love Ma'am but not in war. Everyone give me 20 push-ups. Come on, come on, come on. Start. One. Two. Four. Five. Pull it up. Do it properly. Straight up. You only need to do 20, come on. It's not their cup of tea. Three. You, keep your pelvis straight. Pelvis straight. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. You need to say Kabaddi. Form a chain. How else do you plan to catch me? Come on, form a chain. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi. You need to come towards me as I move to that side. Wriggle out of it and touch. Got it? Now you try. That's it. Come on, next. Come on. Yeah, that's it. Go. Don't you have any strength in your arms? Go to the back of the line. Technique is the most important thing. No player can make progress without a good technique. Catch. Catch it. Is the ball going to bite you? Go, go, go! Don't stop. Keep going. Move aside. Up! Down! Up! 8 laps done! Come on! Fast, fast, fast. We have to do 20. Fast, fast, fast. Move, move, move, Go! Go! Go! Yes. Very good! Move, Move. Come on! Very good, very good. Don't drop the ball. Go, go, go. Don't make the circle smaller. Come on Faster, Faster, Faster You guys are destined to die with your heads buried inside books. Cover the distance, cover the distance. No one can teach you. My team is filled with idiots. Come on. What happened? You got tired? You cannot do it? You are at the wrong place. Your Singh Sir's practice is going on over there. Go and participate in the Olympiad. Meet me outside the institute in the evening. Why? Did his bike break down? At four. I won't be coming. A teacher's job is to teach. Any teacher can take a student from 90 to 100,... but only a good teacher can take a student from 10 to 40. I'm a teacher. If I put in effort, I can even make a donkey run the derby. Where did all these photographs come from? Today, Bablu got all these old photographs uploaded onto a pen drive. So, I'm having a look at them. - You want tea? - No, no. Let me help you with that. Why are my hands in the pockets in all these photographs? As a kid you always used to keep sucking your thumb. I tried really hard to break your habit. I slapped you, applied chilli powder on your thumb, but you didn't give it up. Then one day I got an idea, and made the elastic of all your shorts loose. After that, whenever you'd put your thumb into your mouth, your shorts would slip down. So you'd keep holding your shorts up all day long, to make sure they don't slip down. That's how I managed to break that habit of yours. It is not easy to raise kids. You will know when you'll have to raise your own. You need to apply more brains than a sleuth. Anyone hungry? Yes, Sir! Who wants to eat guavas? - I do, Sir. - I do, Sir. Have you ever plucked guavas from this orchid and had them? - No, Sir. - No, Sir. Really? Then go, pluck them. Go, they are very tasty. Move it. Guavas contain iron. Over there. That one. Hello? Mr. Ombir? School kids are having a blast in your guava orchid. They have plucked all the guavas from the trees. Damn it. Why the hell are you guys still standing here? Take the dogs and teach them a lesson. Throw it. Run! Run! Run! - Run, kids! - Run faster! Quick, quick, quick. Hurry up. Faster, faster, faster. Cross it. - Here. - Sir. It's the fruit of your labour only. - I had to teach you guys how to run. - Sir, we were really scared Neelu? Your work here is done. Who'd like to go in there to race with the dogs again? - I will, Sir. - I will go, Sir. You are choosing the wrong team, Neelu. The team isn't complete yet.. It'll be formed now. But isn't this competition between boys, Neelu? No, the competition is between students. And this is a co-ed school. These girls are students of this school too. Why did you become a teacher in a co-ed school if you wanted to discriminate? Sir, don't make them play. They are nothing but an unnecessary worry. They will get hurt. Just imagine, what if someone pulls their plaits? Let go. I'm not the one holding. Pinky, let him go For every player, the three most important things are Speed. Stamina. Strength. If even one of them is lacking, means the player is lacking. Understood? Yes, Sir. What all? Speed. Stamina. Strength. Very good. Go, go, go. Put in more effort. Put in more effort. Pull. "Take a fall" "Pick a fight" "Then commit yourself to your dreams" "Take a fall" - Done practicing with this for the day? - "Pick a fight" - Yes, Sir. - Now practice with this. "Then commit yourself to your dream" "You can own the ground," "you just need to rightfully demand" Who all want to eat chicken? - I do. - "Take a fall" "Pick a fight, commit yourself to your dream" If you want to eat them, you'll have to catch them too. Right? So I'll let them out, all you need to do is catch them. "It's time to get ready" "And take the leap" "And take the leap" Now, with this. Come on. Pass. Correct dribbling and concentration are a must in Basketball. So this is your court, start practicing. - Bend this leg and take a single turn, - "Whatever is prewritten" - then lift your leg from here. Okay? - "isn't absolute" Pay attention to Singh Sir. He's teaching such a good technique. Come on. "Whatever is prewritten isn't absolute" "You can shape your destiny the way you want" "He has asked you" "So don't miss this opportunity" "Take a hold of your destiny" "Who has stopped you?" Throw! "Overcome the hurdles," "of your own making" "It's time to get ready" "And take the leap" Chicken's ready but what will we eat it with? We'll have to make flatbreads. Right. Who'll make the flatbreads? Who'll make flatbreads? Harder. Use your wrist, knead harder. It's very dry, add some water. Sir, even mom hasn't started teaching us this yet. And she shouldn't also. Sir, let them handle the dough kneading. We'll do something else meanwhile. Zip it. Sir, this is what they'll be doing in the future? I hope that answers your question. Carry on. Very good. Who all will have juice? For guavas, he makes dogs run after us. For chicken, he makes us catch them. We aren't raising our hands only this time. Drop it. "The fear of the unknown is like quicksand" "You just need to cross it and make every move count" "It's time to pierce the darkness with your roar" "It's time to get ready" - Fast, fast, fast, fast "It's time to get ready" "And take the leap" "And take the leap" Go for it, Pinky. Go for it, Pinky. Go, go, go. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Take a Toe touch, toe touch! - Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi. - Toe touch, Toe touch. Move forward, move forward. Don't give up, Pinky. Go, go, go. Use your strength. Use your strength. Very good, very good. Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi. - Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi. - Try, try, try. Go, go, go. Get off her! Well done Sir. Being lenient towards your own brother was one thing, but you've crossed the line by giving all the boys a license to touch. They are playing all day long instead of studying. They are being made to play Kabaddi during a Mathematics class. My child had scored 80% last term and just 75% this term. When will our kids study if they keep playing all day? Moreover, they lie, get the kids here and make them practice. We would have understood if they were playing Cricket, But what will they gain by playing Basketball and Kabaddi? What are you saying? Sport is an essential activity for kids. We don't object to you teaching sports during the assigned classes. Final exams are approaching, and they are busy making them run around. This is all rubbish. We know everything. You are ruining our children's future in order to save your job. We don't want them to participate in any competition. Yes, we don't want them to participate in it. But mom, let us participate in the tournament at least. Shut up and get back to your class. If we find our children on the ground again, we'll change their school. You people don't get it. It will all be over in just two days. No, no more excuses. Forget two days, we won't allow this for another second. Goodbye. Let's go. - Let's go, lad. - Come on. - Himanshu, hurry up. - Come on. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go home. - He won't study. - We've sent you here to study - You need a good smacking. Want to play, huh? Usha? Shukla Ji, I can give permission for the competition, but I cannot force the parents into allowing their kids to participate. If you can manage to get the kids back, you can go ahead with the competition. Students cannot learn without practicing. Dad? Keep sitting. His grandfather was a famous lawyer. I was petrified when I started interning with him. All kinds of people used to come there. - No. - What... Don't hesitate. Take it. Some obviously looked guilty, while some clearly looked innocent. Cheers. One day a man with murder charges on him came to us. His grandfather asked, "What do you think?" I immediately replied, "He is guilty." "Don't take his case. You will lose." He asked all his assistants to leave his cabin, and had a talk with me. He said, "Son, we are lawyers." "Our job is not to pass judgments, but to fight for our clients." "Right or wrong, every person has a right to fight for themselves" "and it is our job to fight for them." "You win some and you lose some." "But never declare the judgment before the case is over." "Neither to your client nor to yourself." You know,... he won the case. No one believed that he would, but he did. That's the day I understood, no matter how evident your defeat is, judgment takes place only after the argument is over. Son, people who win are often those who keep deferring accepting defeat. All it takes is one more witness, one more question. Just one more argument. Don't quit. No way. But the kids will come only if their parents allow them to. Not just the kids, their parents will also come. We are from counter number five. We deserve another argument. Hello, Ma'am. Hello, Ma'am. Hello, Ma'am. Mom, she teaches me Computers. Hello. Pinky, get some water. Please have a seat. He is Pinky's father. Hello. I hope everything is alright. It's not, but it will be if you send Pinky for tomorrow's competition. Competition? Please have some water. No, thank you. Are you done? Conciliation, Price, Punishment, Disjunction. So, conciliation. Sir, have you seen the film Dangal? There were two fathers in it. One who got his daughter married at a young age, and the other who made his daughter so skilled, that she won a medal for the country. Which father's role had Aamir Khan portrayed in it? The second one. Now you decide which father do you wish to be. - I... - Price! I need to name two students for a Computers scholarship. I can refer Pinky's name if you want. Punishment! Sir, Bijender, the one who owns the shop next to yours, claims that the land your shop is on was sold by your father to his father. He has found the transfer deed in an old trunk kept in the attic. He has sent this notice. Ma'am, I tried my best to convince him otherwise. It is not right to make a false case against a decent man. But he paid no heed to it. Now tell me, do I try to convince him some more, or do we meet in court? Disjunction! Pinky, your father doesn't want you to progress in life. He's asked you to drop out from the competition so that you can do household chores? Oh no, Pinky. Don't cry. I'd suggest once you get a little older, just run away from home. Now, I'm done! Tomorrow morning at seven. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Get straight to punishment. Let's give others a try at least. It'll be a waste of time. Look at his face. Punishment. Punishment. Your son will fail no matter what. I'll grade him an F even if he gets his answers right. His year will be wasted. That's for sure. Conciliation, Price, Punishment, Disjunction. - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning. - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning, Sir. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's go! We don't have to just defeat them, we have to crush them so bad, that they don't dare to enter the field again. No pep talk, Sir? What's there to say? My speech won't help. You know how to play. I'm confident you can do it. Go and have fun. - Ready? - Yes, Sir. I welcome you all from the commentary box, along with Principal Usha. Yay! Support our team with gusto. Ma'am, you were saying,.. the parents won't send their kids? I wasn't saying, I was hoping. I can't watch Montu lose so badly. The game has just begun. Let them warm up a little. There you go! Scores are level. 3-2 Why? Why did Bablu get three points, - and Pinky got only two? - Bablu, get out of the screen This is unfair, Usha. You get more points if you score the basket from a distance. Sit down, what are you doing? - He's from Singh's team. - But Bablu is our son. Yeah, go for it Gaurav. - Shoot from there itself. - Pass the ball, Pass the ball. Go, go, go, go! Pass it to Pinky, pass it to Pinky Cover him, cover him - Pass it Pinky. She is open. - You can do it, kiddo. Go, go, go, Bablu. Come on! Go, go, go. Yes! Block him, block him. - Block him - Go, go, go. They deserve five points for that! The maximum they can score is three. Block him, Block him. Block from behind Singh Sir's team is in the lead in the first quarter. Go, go, go. Very good, very good. Singh Sir's lead is into double figures Singh Sir - 21, Montu - 08 Don't attempt three pointers. Come on Pinky! Attack! - Block her, block her - You are doing great. Excellent! Oh, sorry. - What are you doing? - Well, I... Why are you shooting from such a distance? Pass the ball. Pass it ahead. Well done! Hurry up. The way Montu's team,... is making a comeback,... it won't take them long,... to cover the lead. Good, good, good. Well done. Look at that. Through such small legs, he managed to pass a Basketball. Come on, come on, come on. Tighten the defence. Defend harder Well done! Well done! Pinky! Referee, time out! Time out! What happened? Why did they stop the game? What happened? You guys can't play anymore? You guys are doing well. You just need to pay attention on your defence. Play your game, stay focused. The ball always travels faster than the player. Got it? Don't worry. Very good, very good. Take your time. Both teams are competing fiercely. Excellent. Keep at it. Pinky can easily score four points. - Pinky - Pinky Pinky? What happened? Are you okay? What happened? Pinky? Easy, easy. Don't worry! It's okay. Now, we're doomed. Take it, take it. Lokesh is free Pass it to Lokesh. Last five minutes of the last quarter. Tables can turn any moment now. Block him. Faster, faster. Go, go, go. Just two minutes are left. Pinky's absence is being felt. We won! Well done. Well played, Lokesh. No! Hey! No, don't cry. Hang on a second. Why are you rejoicing? A team that should've lost by 80 points, lost by just 8 points. We have two matches to go. Give it your best. You played so well. Why are you so happy on our defeat, Sir?

Both the teams fought bravely, but like it always happens in any sport, one team wins and the other loses. I'd like to invite the losing coach, Singh Sir, so that he can share a few words with us. Singh Sir, please. Thank you, Shukla Ji. It really adds salt to the wounds when you're already... ...seething from the loss and have to say a few words. When this competition began, I thought, it's a competition between the strongest team and the weakest team. But in the past two days, I saw two teams compete at par. And it's not an easy task to get a weak team up to par. No one better than me can understand that, because I only managed to get a strong team at par. Mahinder Sir, congratulations. It feels really bad to say it, but you... you deserve this victory. Please come and share a few words with everyone. I don't know what to say. These kids helped me keep my respect intact. I'd like to thank a couple of people. First of all, Usha Madam, for giving me this opportunity. Shukla Ji, for giving me the courage. And Dad, who stopped me from giving up. Thank you. Neelu, Ms. Neelima Madam, thank you for everything. My students, who endured all the torture, and committed themselves completely to this. A huge round of applause for them. A big hand for the players from both the teams. And the person I want to thank the most is Singh Sir. Don't take it as a taunt, Sir. I mean it. If you hadn't showed up, I would've never realized that I'm ruining the lives of these kids and mine as well. Whatever the reason, it's because of you that I understood what it means to be a PTI. I understood my responsibility. I can never thank you enough, Sir. I still have some things to say. No matter who won today, we both know that you are a better coach than me, Sir. So if you don't mind, can we work together? I still have a lot to learn from you. Thank you, Sir. Oh, give me a second. Give me a second, please. I forgot to mention something. I would also like to thank the parents of these students, for supporting and encouraging them by coming out here. Thank you. In our country, people want their sons to be like Sachin Tendulkar, and their daughters to be like Saina Nehwal. But no one wants to be Sachin and Saina's parents. To be Sachin Tendulkar, Saina Nehwal, Virat Kohli, Sania Mirza, P.V. Sindhu, Deepa Karmakar, Vishwanathan Anand, Abhinav Bindra, Dhanraj Pillay, Gopichand, Dhyan Chand, Sakshi Malik, Geeta Phogat, P. T. Usha, Mary Kom, Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Mithali Raj, Baichung Bhutia, Sunil Chhetri, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, their parents, their coaches and their PTIs' support is required. You cannot become one without them. Our kids will also become great sportspersons. But before that, we would have to become their support. Sorry. Sorry, this sounded like a boring speech, right? No. Thank you, thank you. Montu Sir. Sir, I'd say quit being a PTI and contest in the elections instead. Singh Sir is absolutely right. Contest in the elections and become the Sports Minister. Shukla Ji. Sir, you have made us toil so hard. We deserve a party at least. Yes, you'll get a party, I just have to win one more match.
