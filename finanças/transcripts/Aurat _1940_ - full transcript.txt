You Tube - Video Running Time 02:32:07 You Tube search name - Aurat - 1940 Shamu! Shamu! Coming, ma'am! Coming! 'Coming, coming.' I've been calling out 'Shamu' all day long. Can't you hear? You've lost your head just because you're getting married. Can't you see? I was changing, mother. Change your clothes? It is so bright and there's so much to be done. When will you arrive at your in-laws? At midnight. The cart isn't even ready yet. The cattle haven't been fed. Even the cushion hasn't been laid out in the cart. Who will do it if not you? Do we have servants on call? What are you still waiting for? Get moving or I'll smack you in front of the guests. Mr. Raghunath, let's see whose cattle win at your in-laws. Who won at Shankar's wedding? Never mind that. My Dulari was unwell that time. A bad worker blames his tools. Hey! I came in first. How could you be first? We won. I say so. Who cares what you say? Everyone saw who won. Tell us Bhola, whose cattle came first? Why are the two of you fighting? Both of them will be fed. Happy? He isn't going to feed them. He's stingy. Where is my Shamu's cart. Take a look. Feed them. Feed them. He won't feed them. He's come here to get married. He is extremely miserly. Wedding chants Why do you tarry, guests? You are going to your darling's town The path is treacherous Lest we be late Why do you tarry? Why do you tarry, guests? Why? They showed great courage getting her married. Why wouldn't they? They have only one daughter. They gave her plenty of jewelry as well. Bracelets, bangles, armlets, anklets, etcetera. I don't care about that stuff. I could never pay it all back. I liked the girl. It would be acceptable to me... even if they didn't give her anything. But aunty, even you showed generosity. What do you mean? Wouldn't she get her son married? Of course she'd get him married... but to do so during such times is a big deal. And she mortgaged her land. Oh really? Who told you that? To whom did I mortgage the land? How would I know, aunt? The villagers are saying you mortgaged the land... to Sukhi Lala. 'Sukhi Lala!' Let him say it to my face. I'll break all his teeth. As though aunt Sundar has nothing. She was begging. 'Mortgaged the land. Mortgaged the land.' Yes, it is true. I mortgaged and repossessed the land several times. Lord knows whether I will be able to repossess it now? If it is in my fate, I'll get it back. If not, then I won't be able to get it back. God... please uphold my honor. Hope has appeared in my life Cool winds blowing and flowers abloom I am the garland around my darling's neck It is the spring of my life Listen to me, bird. The cuckoo calls Listen to me, bird. The gardens are abuzz These are the tales of leaves Garlands here are made from flower gems Listen to me, bird. The cuckoo calls Water has been showered onto my fields My eyes are wounded and my heart is stabbed Your beloved is working for you My eyes are wounded and my heart is stabbed Listen to me, bird. The cuckoo calls I won't say it but my darling is unique My darling is unique. My lord is unique I won't say it but my darling is unique Don't go to the fields in the afternoon, my darling If it is sunny my darling will feel thirsty I won't say it but my darling is unique My darling is unique. My lord is unique I won't say it but my darling is unique Walk slowly or the water might spill out of your pot. Careful you don't sprain your slim waist. You are jesting today. What's the reason? It's not my time to jest. This is your time to do that. The more you work and the more you move about... the better it is for you. Of course. I know how knowledgeable you are. Only you know these things, others know nothing. Let's go. Hey Shamu, is your lunch here? No, it must be on the way. Bansi, God should bestow every man with a wife like yours. She's so pretty and so capable. And in the very first year... - Do you have good news? - Yes. Bravo, tiger! Bravo! It's simple logic. The more fertile the land, the faster the tree will grow. Yes, that's right. But Shamu, our land is so barren. It's been five years but no hope yet. You're talking like a failure. You should never despair. It had better be a boy. That's not in our hands. I don't want any excuses. If it's a girl I'll strangle someone. Me or the baby? The girl? Oh lord! That would be murder. Whatever. And what will you do if it's a boy? You'll make a nose ring? Yes. It'll be a boy. I know it. How? The moment I stepped out of the house this morning... I was confronted by a man. It'll be a boy. Is that so? Radha still has six months to go. There would be. - But you should be ashamed of yourself. - Why? - It's been five years since we got married and... - Okay, okay, let it be. We've had nothing. How is it my fault? It's god's wish. Sure, call it god's wish or that you had two dozen sons... in your last life, that's why god didn't give you... even one in this life. You shouldn't get so upset. There's a mango tree in my courtyard A mango tree. Yes, yes, a lemon tree In my courtyard There's a mango tree in my courtyard Come, my darling Don't dance during the day. Sing, my darling Swing on this In my courtyard There's a mango tree in my courtyard Poor me has to wander from pillar to post Why do I need? In my courtyard There's a mango tree in my courtyard My life was very content Alone for months In my courtyard There's a mango tree in my courtyard The darkness is gone, giving way to light I was alone. I ran into my sweetheart In my courtyard There's a mango tree in my courtyard A mango tree. Yes, yes, a lemon tree In my courtyard There's a mango tree in my courtyard Uncle Shamu! Uncle Shamu! The baby is born. It was crying. What is it? A boy or a girl? I don't know. You didn't ask me to find out whether it was a boy or a girl. Go find out whether it's a boy or a girl. - I'll go right away. - Listen! - Yes? - Don't say I want to know. My baby's hair is curly Long live the mother. Long live the father May the newborn's entire family live long Aunt Sundar. Aunt Sundar. Is it a boy or a girl? Have you lost your mind? Uncle Shamu wants to know. Oh lord! These modern times! Boys these days have no shame whatsoever. He wants to know whether it's a boy or a girl. Go tell him it's a boy. Your sister-in-law Kamla says it's a boy. She's summoned you to see him. And tell him he has a big moustache. My baby's hair is curly What happened? Tell me what happened. - Curly hair! - Are you going to tell me or not? It's a boy! A boy! - A boy! - Yes! Chandu! Mohan! Chuni! Come here, come here. And uncle Shamu, aunt Kamla said he has a big moustache. My baby's hair is curly What happened? - What happened? - What happened? It's a boy! A boy! Here. You shameless man! How dare you peek at your wife! His father was like that too. He did the same when he was born. Shyam plays with colors on the banks of the Yamuna There is revelry in Brindavan. Red color dispersed in the air Say, Hail Lord Krishna! There is revelry in Brindavan. Red color dispersed in the air Radha fills the water gun and aims it at Shyam, causing his eyes to go red Yes, red color dispersed in the air Shyam plays with colors on the banks of the Yamuna lnnocent Radha was drenched in colors Praise lord Krishna! Lord Krishna makes things exciting. It is the festival of colors Shyam plays with colors on the banks of the Yamuna Praise lord Krishna! Come and put my little one to sleep Coming, coming. I'll come and put baby to sleep Grandma, grandma! Jamnadas is going to the post office. - Why not join her, aunt? - Oh no, not now. It's almost evening and neither your mother... nor your father has returned yet. They've put all the responsibility of the house on me. Were it not for me, dogs would take over the house. Come, too, with me. Not now. Nobody to look after the house. No, grandma. Nandu, I'll beat you. Look, Chandu is such a good boy. He is sitting quietly by his grandma. - Grandma. - Yes? I'll play with the top on your head. You're going to play with the top, my sweetheart? You are a prince. Henceforth I'll only give your younger brother and you things. I won't give anything to naughty Lallu. But who is his younger brother? Who is our younger brother? Your brother, of course. Where is he? When will he come? Where is he? When will he come? Not yet. He'll be arriving during the monsoon. And won't my younger brother get wet? No, no, he won't get wet. He will bring an umbrella. Mother! Mother! Daughter-in-law, take your children. I've grown so old but I've never seen such kids before. They can't keep their mouths shut for one moment. Sure, even my Shamu was obstinate... but nothing like your kids. Why complain to me, mother? They are your boys. To whom would I complain? Mother! Mother! See that? See that? Mother! Mother! Mother! I am hungry. Give me food. You're hungry? Come. Sit here. Here. Remove some from there. Mother won't yell, will she? No, no. Mother, he's stealing from there! Daughter-in-law, what are you cooking? Curry and rice. Look, you must add more chile... or my Shamu will remain hungry, just like yesterday. How will the kids eat if it's too spicy? They can eat milk with their rice. You are more concerned for the boys. Grind some chutney as well, daughter-in-law. Mother, I'm very hungry. Grind some chutney as well. Aunt Sundar! Aunt Sundar! Are you at home? Welcome, Sukhi Lala. Welcome. Sit down. Sit. What's the point of sitting, aunty? It's been six years. Never mind the loan... I've yet to receive even any interest. It will be all of six years this monsoon, you understand? So why are you panicking, Lala? Aunt Sundar isn't dying. And even if I die I'll pay off every paisa I owe you before I die. You should be ashamed of yourself. You come here all the time. I told you so many times to be patient for a couple of months. Why? Six years have passed waiting for a couple of months. If it was anyone but me he would have seized your house... your field, cart and cattle by now. I'm not that kind of person. I believe in god and that's why I'm silent. And you're asking me to be patient? You've been very gracious, Lala. What gracious? Will you listen to aunty? She owes me and she's lording it over me. Look Lala, being stern with me will do you no good. If you want the money you need to be tolerant. I wasn't being hostile, aunt. You became antagonistic. Antagonistic nothing. Lord knows how much I've paid off in bits and pieces... but you're behaving like I've never given you any money. That's not true. Everything you've paid me has been written in the account books. The account books are yours. You write what you please. After all, none of us can read. If you're so honest... then give me a receipt for the money I pay you. Excellent! If I make out receipts for two or three rupees... I'll never get any work done. I only issue a receipt when the entire borrowed sum is repaid. Okay Lala, do as you see fit. Aunt, according to me some of this is your fault. It has been six years. If you'd given me some grain every year... you wouldn't be so burdened now. What are you saying, Lala? The amount of grain we have is meager. If I gave you the grain, what would I feed the kids? Look aunt, I'm a professional moneylender. How would I survive if I let you off the hook? And aunt... you could give me one thousand rupees right now... if you had any intention of paying me off. If you don't have anything, send your daughter-in-law... to my house for housework. What did you say? Have you taken leave of your senses, Lala? - Aunt, you... - Silence! You have no wife, mother nor sister. You are a lone man. You expect my daughter-in-law to do your housework? Don't you think before you speak? Lala, just because we are poor today... does it mean we have no dignity? What will the villagers... the neighbors and the community say? Mother will lose her dignity. Very well. The day you get date... we shall see whether you can uphold your dignity. Even if everything is sold off I refuse to lose my dignity. When you are starving then I'll want to see... whether you'd be willing to lose your dignity. Go! Go! Do what you want to do! What's the most you'll do? Take away our cattle and carts or sell the house. As long as we are healthy god will give us more. Bansi, I'm fed up. I thought I'd settle down and my family would grow. So what's wrong with getting married? God has blessed you with a wife so pretty... that one couldn't find in tens of villagers around. And by god's grace you have two kids and are expecting a third. Ask me. I gawk all around but I'm unable to see a thing. The house feels so desolate. You're right, Bansi. But it's nice to have kids when one has food to eat... and clothes to wear. Poverty seems to be gaining on me with wide eyes. And I keep having one kid after another. If it were up to me I'd strangle them. Grandma, Come eat if you're hungry. Why don't you sit down to eat as well, grandma? Come here, grandma. Alright, give me. Serve me. Give me some more. Mother, I want to eat some too. Sit. My darling little prince He will have a car Daughter-in-law. Daughter-in-law, bring me a little water. I've got a cough. Why not? I won't live much longer. Oh god! I can die peacefully. Hey! What is it? Every day I tell you to bring me a sari. Why haven't you got me one yet? If you like I could bring you a sari... that would attract the entire village. I don't care whether the villagers are attracted to it or not. All I want is for you to be attracted to it. Are you saying I'm not attracted otherwise? You are. But you would be more attracted to me then. Really? You think you're still young, do you? And why not? Has my hair become grey or have I lost my teeth? Why wouldn't I think so? A married woman considers herself young... even if she turns a hundred years old. My, my! Sweet sixteen. If you had kids you would be 10 by now. My handsome darling Buy me an ensemble I'll put a veil on you and make you my wife The whole village will come to watch Let me give you a veil I hope nobody casts an evil eye on you Let me give you a veil I am delicate so get me a light color I'll wear the veil to the market Buy me an ensemble I hope nobody casts an evil eye on you Buy me an ensemble Let me give you a veil You didn't feel like working today. You ran home from the fields. It's a very beautiful baby. He's even nicer than Lallu and Chandu. His eyes are exactly like yours. Very beautiful, very beautiful, very beautiful. How are you feeling? I'm okay, mother. Even after all this, life doesn't let go of me. I'm disturbed now. Why are you disturbed? What do you mean, you're disturbed? A baby is born in the family. Don't you dare utter such bad words! A child is born, mother. I don't have money to feed us. How will I feed this child? You're speaking rubbish again! Son, a child is a successor and god's boon. They 'e the ones who will carry on our family name. They'll carry on our family name... if we can nurture them and raise them. And why not, son? Children are born with their fate. You watch, this child will be so blessed... all our sorrows will disappear. Sure mother, you said that even when the first two were born. But we're still barely getting by. How long will we appease ourselves this way? Father! Father! What is it? What? Will you shut up or shall I hit you? 'Father! Father! Father!' I'll bind your legs together if you cry. Not even god knows what to do with this lot. Father, come celebrate the festival of colors with us. Quiet! Why are you getting upset? - Mother. - Yes. Father gets very upset. Go play with grandma. You haven't eaten anything since this morning. Eat something now. What's the matter with you? Go! All of you distress me. Neither I nor you lot are dying. Why are you cursing yourself? I'm the one to blame for everything. Nonsense! I'll celebrate the festival of colors with my darling today With my darling. With my darling I'll celebrate the festival of colors with my darling today I fill the water gun and aim it at him This color makes my heart beat fast He puts color on his lover on the festival of colors I'll celebrate the festival of colors with my darling today With my darling. With my darling What is the matter with you, Radha? Do you know what's going on? Today is the festival of colors. Holi is for the youth. What's it to me? You aren't old. I'm worse than an old woman. I celebrated Holi... and the festival of lights at my parents' home. So what's happened now? Now I have no joy, happiness or excitement about anything. Everything feels good when we have food to eat. But I feel even worse when I look at my husband. How can I be happy when he is sad? Mother! Mother! Mother, mother, won't you come to see the dance? Please change your clothes, mother. I told you to change your clothes before giving the sweets. And I told you to pay. Mother! Won't you come to watch the dance? To whom should I leave them? Listen! You are asleep just like my fortune. My heart questioned me. Dear... You are sati. Your existence depends on the well being of your husband. Based on this belief... Lord? My darling left me high and dry Don't be afraid of sorrow The one to whom you always said this, "You mean more than life itself"... you turned away and broke the heart... of a fragile girl You also took half with you Mother, I'm hungry. Go to sleep, son. You're hungry today but you will be full tomorrow. Your father will bring food tomorrow. 'Father will bring food. Father will bring food.' From where will he bring food? Nothing is grown in our fields. I won't wait for much longer. I'll acquire the land within a day or two. But Lala, the poor chap's kids will starve to death. Brother, as long as the lady is young, the kids won't die. I put my faith in god and got married. You strut like a masochist. Father! Father! Shut up! Why are you behaving this way? He is hungry. What am I supposed to do if he's hungry? Let him die! You shouldn't say such things. God will be offended. If he gets offended then complain to him. Why do you get so cross? When we haven't had anything for so long what will we get now? Let them starve to death. How can I let them die? God has given us... If he's given them to us, let him fill their stomachs. Why ask me? You brush God aside and you're talking about sins. Shut up! Damn you. You're aware, Lala, I haven't reaped a crop this year. I don't want to know about the crop. Simply sign the land over to me... or I'll sue you and you'll have to pay expenses. I'll get your house auctioned along with your fields. Give me. Have some consideration for my kids, Lala. I've given sufficient consideration to the kids. What have you planned? It's almost dawn. You don't sleep yourself or let me get any sleep. What do you gain from it? Tusli. You've already decided on a name? - Does it mean it's a girl? - Yes. How did you know? My heart says so. And the goddess is herself a female. She won't bless us with a boy. I don't mind even if it is a girl. I wish she'd bless us with a child. Radha and I will deliver within a few days. Does it mean? Of course. They're going to have a child. Poor Shamu is very perturbed these days. And even my poor Radha is very depressed. I haven't seen her smile for a long time. She was very happy before she got married. So who's to blame for it? Nobody. It is karma. That's the way of the world. Some laugh and some cry. Some sad women can't sleep all night due to abject sorrow. And some married women like me... lay their heads at their husband's feet in moonlight... and pray. This life can't be trusted. Daughter-in-law. Why is your vermilion spot messed up? Brother, have you seen Chandu's father? No. What's the matter, sister Radha? Chandu's father! Chandu's father! Brother Bansi, have you seen Chandu's father? No, what is the matter? Where is he? Radha! Radha! Radha! Listen to me! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother, where has father gone? - He's gone on a pilgrimage. - Where? To Brindavan, son. When will he return? He'll be back in a couple of days. Mother, are you crying because he didn't take you? Did you learn anything? Has he gone away? Yes, defeated by the world. What will become of the poor man's child? Radha. Radha. Aunt. Radha, why are you so restless? Aunt, sister Radha, don't panic. He must have gone out on an errand. He'll be back. All of us are here for you. There's no reason to panic. - Mother! - Mother! We're taking the yoke to go till the land like father. Yes, I'm going too. Not now, son. Grow up first, son. Will father be back from Brindavan by then? Grandma. Grandma. Grandma. Here. You asked for water, didn't you? Take the water. Grandma. Chandu, I don't know what's the matter with grandma. She isn't talking. Grandma isn't talking? No. Come, I'll show you. Grandma. Grandma, why aren't you talking? Grandma. Come, let's tell mother. Mother, mother, grandma isn't talking. Mother, mother, grandma is asleep. She's sound asleep. Okay, okay. You wait here. Mother, open up! Mother, open up! Mother, open the door! Open. Mother! Let us come in, mother. No, my boys. Why? - Why? - Grandma has left us. Where? To join father? To join father? Mother, why are you crying? Uncle, please weigh this. What are you doing? You have only a few things left. Will you sell these as well to feed the Brahmans? How will she achieve salvation if I don't feed them, uncle? And this is all I can do for mother. Mother, you give us dry bread and serve sweets to them. - We want sweets too. - Mother, we want sweets too. Yes, I'll feed you sweets. Mother! Open the door. Open. Mother, open the door. What is it? Go play outside. We are afraid. Aunt Kamla, has my younger brother arrived? Aunt Kamla, has my younger brother arrived? Not yet. Go out. He'll come from there. Mother! Mother! Let us enter. Mother! Mother! Let us enter. Let us enter. Kamla! - Let us enter, mother. - Let them enter. Lala, please be patient. What can she do all by herself? I don't care. She is shirking every day. Life is not to be trusted. I could die or she might... Stop it already, Lala! Why should she die? The poor thing has young children. Why don't you die? If you die half the village will come alive. If people could be cursed to death... by now I would have died at least forty to fifty times. You need not be afraid, Lala. You'll kill the entire village before you die. You talk big. Why don't you tell your husband to give me my money? Why tell me? Talk to him. I'll surely talk to him. Never mind all that. Tell her to give me my money. I don't care about the rest of the world. Lala, does excess wealth make people blind as well? Can't you see? What does she have to give you? She sold what little she had. Some of it went towards repayment of small loans. The rest was used for the aunt's death. What does she have now to give you? Of course she has. She can sell the land and pay me. And what will she feed the kids? Your heart? I'm not responsible for the kids. Whether she feeds them my heart or her own head... is not my problem. I am cautioning you, Shamu had signed the deed. I'll bring a court order within a few days... and have them sell the house and land. She'll get only a tenth of the value. And that will make you happy, won't it? Lala, I ask you, will you... take all that wealth with you when you die? Why are you victimizing the poor, Lala? I often wonder about that, Kamla. May I say something if you don't mind? Look, Shamu was an honorable man. He probably went and drowned himself somewhere. Aunt Sundar was left, and she passed away too. That leaves her alone. If she wishes she could take my wealth. Lala! You scoundrel! Get out of my house. God has given you so much wealth... you lust over ladies from other families. Thank god your kin died. Else you would lust for them as well. Rogue! Very well. Radha. Kamla. I wouldn't have to take this if he were here today. Don't be dejected, Radha. They'll grow up. Oh god... give me strength... to live this cruel life. Save my honor. Mother, why did you give him half? We're the ones who tilled the land. Son, we tilled his land. That's why we gave him half. Mother, who is this? Son, this is the priest from the temple. And him? - He's come from the farmhouse. - And him? He is the guard who took care of the land. What do we have in our share? We have god and you in our share. Here, take him. Can't you see I'm busy? How do I take her? You were so excited about a child before she was born... and now she's born, you don't want to lift her. Really? You think you've achieved a feat? We have a child after all these years and it's a girl. First you raise them. Then you give dowry and hand them over to others. Don't you know a girl is born with her own destiny? She'll take away whatever is in her destiny. - A girl is akin to a goddess. - 'A girl is akin to a goddess.' - Sister Radha is also a goddess. Shut up. Never mind that. How is she to blame? Damn you. Hush, my dear. Your mother fights with me, my dear. Hush. Mother, give us new clothes at the next festival of lights. Me, too. Yes, yes, I'll get some for you all. Won't you speak? Don't you want new clothes? Okay, I'll get new clothes for you as well. No mother, he remains nude and urinates. Oh god, you've been very merciful towards poor me. Give me the strength to make these little kids capable... so that they may earn an honest living for themselves. I want nothing more in this world. I am happy. Very happy. Mother, you said it would rain. That's right, mother, when will it rain? Lala, we are starving. We are here for your advice. What can man say about god's decisions? And you are a Brahmin. Can't you understand something so simple? If god wants us to starve to death... then we should certainly die. We are duty bound. But Lala, helping people during their bad times... and feeding the hungry is also our duty. No, no, no, no. Feeding the hungry is not my duty. It cannot be my duty. If god wants you to die and I feed you... that would be the greatest sin. Lala, you could call us sinners, but please give us something. Our children are starving to death. Lala, you have no sense of duty whatsoever. You can't take this wealth with you when you die. The world is dying because of the famine. Radha, how is he? Mother! Mother! No! No! No! The land is arid anywhere you look. The trees have burned in the sun. The starving animals stray here and there... looking for green pastures... and they find nothing but dry mud and stones. Cows are being murdered. Thousands have starved to death. If you have eyes then look at the buffalo carcasses. The dogs lick them but find them dry and turn away. The crows claw at them but find no joy in them... like they were dry sticks. There's no food as it is but now finding water, too, has become a task. The lakes have dried up. No water remains in the rivers and canals. Dust has settled over the wells. Even a stone would thaw at the sight of this, never mind man. But you're sitting tight on a treasure. Lala, have some mercy on the cattle if not these men. These are the cattle that god used to herd. This is our only wealth. This is our only asset. How will we have bulls if we don't have them? And how will we till the land if we don't have bulls? Please leave. Don't pick on my brains. Go away. You should be ashamed of yourselves for begging from man. Can't you see that huge temple... where the god who runs the world resides? Why don't you approach him? What do I have? Go over there. Mother, where did brother Lallu go? To visit grandma. I will go too. No! No, god! No! God, you have given us this life and you will take it... but it is very unbecoming of you to make us starve. God, we are sinners. Please give us some grace time... so we might redeem some of our sins... to prepare ourselves for our next life. Radha! Radha! What about the money? These days you have a good excuse. To say that there's a famine. But Sukhi Lala doesn't care about the famine. By the grace of god everything is well with me. Here. You're giving me a corpse. I'd take him if you adorned him with gold jewelry. There are plenty of starving corpses in the village. It's still not too late. I'll tell you again. There's no scarcity at my house. Come over. Why are you killing your children? Save the remaining two kids. God! Won't rain ever pour here again? Have you heard our cow died too? Their cow also died? We dug up the roots of trees all this time to feed them... and yet we couldn't save them. The poor thing finally died. It's still not too late. I'll tell you again. There's no scarcity at my house. Come over. Why are you killing your children? Save the remaining two kids. Welcome, welcome, Radha. My dream turned out to be true. Come in. Come. Last night I dreamed you were dressed up like a bride. You're here to brighten my house just like the moon. You made the dream come true partially by coming here. But you didn't groom yourself. Lala, what do you care about grooming? I've come to sell my body for my children. Okay, Radha, okay. But when a business person sells his product... he packages it nicely before selling it. You're only looking at the exterior, not the soul. Soul? Radha, god looks at the soul... while the world only looks at beauty. It's a miracle. Come. Come, come. Come. Radha, this is really good. Fortune leaves people's home at dusk. But voluntarily walks to Sukhi Lala's house. Who are you calling a goddess? You, of course. Yes, Lala, you're right. The poor goddess couldn't protect her own in the evening. She's here to lose her dignity to you today. Goddess, you lost your dignity in your incarnation of Radha. I made a mistake. Radha! Radha! Sister Radha! Sister Radha, help me out! Sister Radha! Sister Radha! Sister Radha! Sister Radha! Sister Radha! Sister Radha! Sister Radha! Our pots are dry, the cattle thirsty. Give us water Give us water. Give us water Our pots are dry, the cattle thirsty. Give us water The soil is thirsty Fill the dry lakes Fill the dry lakes, God. Give us water Give us water. Give us water Our pots are dry, the cattle thirsty. Give us water Let the fields become green again with your blessings Please fulfill our wish Let the fields become green again with your blessings Give us water.

Dear, I can beat all of you. Don't even dare. Come on! What do you think to me. Come on! Come on! Come on! I'd like to see who is so brave. Running away now! They think they're very brave. Come. Come forward, son. I forbid you a thousand times not to gamble... but you always ignored me. Rascal! I'll break all your bones. You should be ashamed of yourself for playing with the untouchables. This is how you make your father proud? I swear by you, uncle I wasn't playing. What were you doing if you weren't playing? Rascal! Uncle, I swear by you I wasn't playing. I swear by god. I was teaching those boys how to throw. You think you're a teacher! Go home directly or I'll beat you all night. Scoundrel! Uncle, if you're going to the market... please find out the price of millet and wheat. Get lost! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! What a boy! Talk, talk. Please talk, bird of the forest Your songs sound so sweet. Your songs are very lovely Sing in my ears, bird Please talk, bird of the forest Talk, talk, darling, even if the forest catches fire Your song is priceless, oh bird. Priceless Please talk, bird of the forest The bird of the forest is crazy about you The bird of the forest is your devotee Please open your mouth, sweetheart Please talk, bird of the forest The forest bird is crooning on the branch Sing to the body, bird of the mind I am frantic Please talk, bird of the forest Oh, so you were singing all this while. I thought my darling Jamuna was singing. Come to me, darling. Let me embrace you. You sound exactly like my sweetheart Jamuna. And look at your face. Your nose, your eyes, your ears. Brilliant! Your teeth. You will be my wife hereafter while I shall be your husband. What did you say? It won't happen? You want to marry me without checking out my birth chart? Oh Ram! Which priest do I summon for you? Who called you here? You're feeling edgy at the sight of your competition. You're feeling jealous. Let go off me! I'll check out the birth charts of Jamuna and Dhoka... and then marry the one most compatible. What are you doing Jamuna? What are you doing? You killed her! You destroyed everything. Let her go! Let her go! Let her go! The poor thing is dead. She's dead. She's dead. So much jealousy! So much hostility! So much jealousy! So much hostility for poor Dhoka! Let's go. Jamuna, tell me the truth. You're under youth's oath. Were you or weren't you Dhoka in your last birth? Okay, now go. Go. Go. Greetings, aunt. - Bless you, son. Bless you - Come in. - You're quite late. - I couldn't help it, son. I bumped into sister Kashi on the way here. I stood there talking to her. Tell me, how is Parvati today? Thanks to your mercy she is well. Mercy on us. Sit. What mercy can man do, son? It is god's mercy. Did you bring the medication? How could I? I was waiting for you. Here. Hurry up and bring the medication. I'll sit with her in the meanwhile. Lord Krishna accosted me I was disgraced on the street What are you doing over there? Couldn't you find another place in the village? There are plenty of places... but there's no better place than this right now. You should be ashamed of yourself, Birju! - Have you no shame? - Shame for what? Lord Krishna is sitting here watching... while goddess Radha is bathing over there. Don't say that. Aunt's name is also Radha. Hey! Don't you dare say such things! Don't you know I'm a very evil man? Who cares? If you're evil then go home. Why have you come here? Very well! I'll teach you a lesson someday that... Leave now. I'm coming out. So, come out. I won't go. - I'd like to see what you'll do. - Look, Birju... I'll complain to aunt Radha. Sure, go tell her what you want. I'll remain here. Stay there or rip out your eyes. You can't harm me. I pray you slip and your pot breaks. This isn't a man's foot, it's a woman's foot. I forgot what I came to tell you. What is it? I came here to complain about Birju. What? Do you know what happened yesterday? - What happened? - I mean it when I say... if he wasn't your brother I'd tell him off. What did he do? I was going to the fields yesterday... and he was coming from somewhere swaying like this. The moment he got close to me... he said to me, "Where are you going, sister-in-law?" Walk a little slower. I told him, "Behave yourself, Birju." He says, "I am behaving myself. Did I tell a lie?" "Are you saying you aren't my sister-in-law?" Then I could say nothing. You should have told him you weren't his sister-in-law. I felt like asking him who was his sister-in-law? But I couldn't get the words out. - You liar! - And I started walking. I told him to get out of my way. He says, "I won't move.", and he started singing a son. Singing? Which song? - No. - Sing it. - No. - Sing it. - No. - Sing the song. Which one? Sing it. You're under my oath. "Lord Krishna accosted me." "I was disgraced on the street." "Lord Krishna accosted me." "I was disgraced on the street." "Lord Krishna accosted me." Careful. Be careful. This is getting ruined. Set this properly. - Mother! - Who is it? Let go of me. Where have you been since morning, Birju? I went to the market on an important errand, mother. And what was this important errand? Let go of me! I'll fall. How could you fall? I'm holding you. Let go. Let go. I went to the market to find out the market price. The crop will be ready within a couple of days... and I've spoken to a few people about this. You were discussing since morning... and just now uncle Bansi told me... that you were gambling with the untouchables. Uncle Bansi has nothing better to do. He's always hounding me. I mean it, mother, I know nothing about gambling. Do you think I gamble? No, not at all. Mother, can I tell you the truth about where I went? But don't tell anyone or the surprise will be ruined. - Tell me already. - No mother. Promise me first. I won't tell anyone. Look mother, it's like this. A saint has come to a place two miles from here... next to the river bank. He has big locks, long hair and big eyes. He is a very gifted saint, mother. I forgot to tell you, mother. I've been watching him for the past fifteen days. He's been standing on one leg. And not on the ground. So what is he standing on, son? On such a large iron spike. I said to him, "Baba, please bless us as well." He says to me, "Come another day, child." Mother, I said to him, "Okay, Baba." Then he says, "Look up." I'm speaking the truth. It was noon and I could see huge stars in the sky. Then he said, "I will show you god after four days", mother. I will be seeing god in a few days time, mother. Wait there, Manglu. Birju. Listen. Birju, take me there as well. Birju, take me with you tomorrow. I want to ask him something. Look mother, don't tell brother Ramu, or I won't take you. No, no. Mother! Mother! Look at the handsome bulls I bought, mother. The whole village was complimenting them. - Lies, mother. Total lies. - Stop it, Birju! Be quiet! They're very handsome, son. They are, aren't they? My mother! My mother! My mother! They are, aren't they? Look at how handsome the bulls are, mother. Mother, tell brother Ramu to return the rest of the money. What money, mother? - They cost two hundred rupees. - All of two hundred. He's cheating you, mother. He's cheating you. This pair of bulls couldn't be worth more than one fifty. Look mother, Birju is arguing with me for no reason. - Arguing? - Don't fight, son. I'd have paid 150. Mother, he's accusing me of stealing. - Stealing? - No, my boy. So what does he mean? Don't fight, son. Mother, he's spoiled because of your pampering. Sure, she only loves me. She doesn't love you. God... you've been very merciful to me. I have everything I wanted in this world. I want nothing now. I worked day and night and paid off everybody's loans. You have been benevolent. I have everything, our land, fields, cows and bulls. I ask for nothing more. Just get my Ramu and Birju married to good girls. And let me see him. Aunt Radha, I haven't seen Kashi for many days. The poor thing must be busy with her worldly matters. Let it go. She has no worldly matter but one. She will only talk about her daughter when she gets here. Be quiet. She's coming. Welcome Kashi. Welcome. You will live a long time. We were talking about you just now. So where were you all these days, sister Kashi? You left on Monday and only showed up today. What can I say, sister? I have an unmarried daughter at home. How can I get out of the house every day? My legs are shackled. Who did you leave her with today? With whom? I locked her inside. She's asleep inside. Wake up darling Wake up darling. Open the door Your man is at the door My eyes. My eyes are full of sleep Why is someone calling out to me? Your man is at the door I have no man Why is someone calling out to me? I'll get upset and leave, darling Leave. Who are you trying to scare? I implore you. I implore you Just please come to me Wake up darling Wake up darling. Open the door Your man is at the door Jamuna. Jamuna. Aunt Kashi has gone to my house. She's locked you in. Yes, yes, I know. Please leave. Are you sleepy? Yes. Are you going to sleep so late in the day? But why have you shut the window, Jamuna? Ramu, you're a very good man. Go home now. I'm sleepy. Very well. - You really want me to leave? - Yes. But please drop in at the temple on the way. What can I tell you, sister Kamla? I've shown their birth charts three times. Ramu and Tulsi are totally mismatched. Well, I didn't complain to you. If they don't match, let it be. It's god's wish. Sometimes I feel like putting my faith in god and getting him married. Oh no, sister. Please don't do that. I'll give you an example you know of. Nathu's son got married in this manner. You remember what they went through. Within one year both boy and girl passed away. They sob over their fate now. That's right, sister. I, too, doubt. If it's his destiny, he'll marry. Try matching her birth chart with Birju... if it doesn't match Ramu's. Sister Shanti, you've grown old but you've no sense. How will she get her younger son married... if her older son is unmarried? Yes, that's true. I'm losing my mind these days. I worry about my Jamuna day and night. That's right, sister Radha. Even sister Ganga's daughter has come of age. - Try matching their birth charts. - No need for your advice. I've already told sister Radha... if his birth chart doesn't match anyone Tulsi's... then we'll match it with my daughter Jamuna's. She's right here. Ask her. And what's wrong with my Jamuna anyway? Yes, yes. I didn't deny it. Call the priest tomorrow. Sure, I'll call the priest tomorrow. For sure. Where did you go, Tulsi? You're past the age for playing. You'll go to another house in the near future. Will you play there also? Where will I go, mother? You want to argue on top of it? I'm warning you, you're not to leave the house after today. What happened? What could it be? I slog with housework all day long... and your darling daughter won't stop playing. So what? She's only a child. Have you forgotten your time? Listen. Go light the stove. Are you going to do something about Tulsi's wedding? What can I do? I can't go and buy a groom in the market. And her birth chart doesn't match Ramu's. Else she'd be married by now. Just because their birth charts don't match... - doesn't mean there are no other boys in this world. - Why not? Let's tell sister Radha if Ramu's birth chart doesn't match... then let's try matching it with Birju's. Really? I don't want to kill my Tulsi. Else I would marry her to that drunken slob. Even if it meant sister Radha was offended. She's your daughter. Do as you please. - Is everything okay? - It sure is. I've heard he owns a gun. He does, but it's useless. It's a relic from his grandfather. He doesn't used it. Don't worry about it. Okay, let's go. Gulabchand! Gulabchand! Bring the gun! Bring the gun! Something seems to be wrong. - Hurry up. - Coming, sir. - Hurry up. - Coming, sir. Hold the lamp, hold the lamp. Hold the lamp, hold the lamp. Gulabchand. Gulabchand. Shine some light here. I'll kill you! I'll kill you! What are you looking for over here? What's here? Go away. What's your business here? Brother! Brother! Brother! What is here? Go. This is exactly what I needed, uncle. I can't do anything without this.. Here, brother, keep this. Where have you hidden all the rest, uncle? - I have nothing. - Nothing? You hear that? He says he has nothing. Come here. Tell us where it is, uncle? Tell us, uncle. Tell us, tell us. It's in the stove. It's in the stove. Under the stove? Okay, then you dig it out, uncle. Sorry for the trouble. This is where it is? Bring our digging tool. Uncle, the money that you've saved under the stove... every day told you get it out, get it out. We're in big trouble. Uncle, money is supposed to be venerated... but you've buried it under the stove. Dig! Dig! Uncle is having trouble. Help him a little, okay? Brother, tell me your name. Shut up! Okay, don't tell me. Take it. It belongs to your sister-in-law. You're experiencing too much trouble, uncle. Let me remove it. Brothers, we've grown this old but I've never known... of such an incident to take place in our village. We've seen many petty thieves arrive... but such a huge plunder, no brother... that's never happened in our village. Isn't that right, sister Radha? Yes, Lala. You're right. I'm old, too, but I've never known this to happen. Sister Radha, we villagers must do something... about this very soon. Brother, I'm certain this is the work of a known person. It must be someone from our village. How would an outsider know things about our village? That's right, uncle. That certainly makes sense. It's someone we know. That's right. Brothers, I can think of a solution. If everyone agrees then let's follow it... or we'll think of something else. Tell us the solution first, uncle. No uncle, listen to my solution first. What if we dig around our individual houses? Listen to that. Listen to that, Radha. Is this a joke? Shut up, Birju. So Lala, tell us the solution. The solution is that we get together... Yes. And write an application and hand it to the Collector. Okay. That he give four or five people licences to keep guns... for the protection of the village. Which people, uncle? - For example, you. - And I. Thakur Bansidhar, Lala Ramkishor... Mukul Maharaj, Lala lshwardayal, Lala Mukundlal... Lala Phoolchand. Brother, I had a gun but they took that away, too. They took it away? Then you should keep a cannon this time. Silence! So uncle, that makes all the good people. No brother. Uncle hasn't mentioned his own name as yet. Sure, me too. No uncle, you better not buy a gun or raise your expense. And uncle, listen to me. Also employ a servant to use it. Silence, Birju! You're talking too much. Begone! - You see, mother? Uncle Bansi... - Get lost! Go! Lord, please give something to your devotees Sure, offer them, offer them, offer them I yearn to see you, dweller of my dreams Offer them some ambrosia Sure, offer them, offer them, offer them Welcome to the garden of my life And resurrect the ruins Come and make the withered bud bloom Sure, make it bloom, make it bloom The place where that river flows The river that found its banks Bring joy to my mind Sure, let it flow, let it flow Lord, please give something to your devotees Sure, offer them, offer them, offer them What's this? Ramu? Ramu! Ramu! I'm afraid. Ghosts dwell in this tree. What? A ghost dwells here? But I can see a witch on it at this time. Look Ramu, I'll get back at you for this. - When? - After we're married. Is that so? Really? In that case I'm going. No, Ramu! No! No, Ramu! My Ramu. Repeat that. My Ramu. Okay, I'll wait here while you climb down. You must save me if I slip. Well done! Well done! Now let's go. Let's go where? This is your path. And my path is that way. Ghost! Ghost! Go. Why don't you go? Go. Go. Good. Do you think I really got scared? No, you're very brave. And Jamuna, I'm going to the priest with our birth charts. What if our birth charts don't match? Why wouldn't they? Are you joking? I presented two kilos of gram to the priest. And I've promised him another two kilos. Do you think the priest will lie for four kilos of gram? I'm not asking him to lie. I'll tell him it's up to him to make the calculations. Do the calculations in such a way so they match. Wedding chants Brother Ramu. Brother Ramu. What's the matter? I am warning you to curb Birju. I let him get away today for your sake and even took a beating. Tell me what happened. What do you think? First they gamble. And when they lose they start cheating. We bet fifty rupees today. I bet on seven while they bet on nine. It was a seven and he said it was nine and ruined the board. And when I complained he beat me up. Has anyone ever won against Kanhaiya so far? It is regrettable. They sold millet for money. They lost it all. How dare you gamble! I'll break the heads of all the gamblers in this village! I'll break your leg if I catch you gambling. You hear that? Mother... whether you like this or not... I'm going to take Birju's limbs apart. Why? What happened? Very soon your son will sell you and me to gamble. He sold grain worth two hundred rupees and gambled it away. Oh god! I wondered where he went early this morning. He's spoiled because you pamper him. You always take his side like he's your only son, not I. What are you suggesting? That I strangle him? That I kick him out of the house? For sure! If my son were a scoundrel who brought disgrace... I wouldn't let him stay at home another minute. Okay, son. If he were here, he wouldn't say this. Birju! Wait! Birju, where's the money? - Money? - Yes. What money? The proceeds from the sale of millet today. - Sold millet? Who sold it? - Yes. Birju, I'm asking you where the money is. You gambled away two hundred today, didn't you? I gamble? Mother. Look mother, tell brother to stop. He has started bothering me very much nowadays. And if I say anything you tell me off for misbehaving with my older brother. Birju, where is the money? How is that money your concern? I sold my share of the grain. Who gave you the right to question me? Ramu! Shut up, scoundrel! Talking about his share. How many days did you work on the fields? You're exhausted when it's time to work but first to demand a share. Very well. Right from the start I knew I couldn't stay in this house. Anyway, I'll go somewhere. Oh god! I never imagined I would see my family split in my lifetime. I thought my kids would bring me joy at this age. Mother, I knew you would lay all the blame on me. No, son, I'm not blaming anyone. My destiny is to blame. Birju? Let me go, mother. Don't stop me. Ramu. Mister, where are you going? Kashi? None of your business. Anywhere. Okay, forgive me. You're big. This has nothing to do with being big or small. Birju, you want me to hit you some more? Come here. Let go of this. Ramu, embrace him. How dare you go away? Don't you care about mother? My dear. Pull. Pull harder. Pull harder. Listen. How will we manage if Birju continues this way? We'll manage everything. I'll tell mother to get Birju married. He'll mend his ways once he's married. He won't mend his ways now. Today he sold grain so he could gamble. Tomorrow he'll sell the land to gamble. I know you won't distribute your land. Why should you do his work as well? He'll never do any work... but he'll always stand in front to take his share. Daily arguments and daily fights. It would be best if you built another house and live in it. Jamuna! You've said this today... but I don't ever want to hear it again. Good or bad, Birju is my brother. You're talking about grain? I wouldn't split from him even if he sold me. Jamuna, you can't separate the sea beating it with a stick. We are both the sons of the same mother. Birju, stop being such a cad! Move out of my way! Look Tulsi, think before you speak. Anger will get you nowhere. You get that? The village is one mile from here. I'll chop you up and bury you. I was only joking. I swear by you, Tulsi, I've given up all my vices. Cannabis, marijuana, gambling and alcohol. And what about eye-teasing? I swear by my youth. I shall only eye-tease you. All females are akin to sisters and mothers other than you. Why do you eye-tease me? That's an entirely different matter. Very well. I'm getting late. I'm going. Listen to me. Where are you going? Listen! I swear by god you are very fortunate. Being my wife is not something ordinary. All the girls in the village will be green with envy. All of them had high hopes. And what if my birth chart doesn't match yours? Of course it will! I'll burn down the priest's house. You just said you've given up your vices. I'm a gentleman with gentlemen... and a scoundrel with rogues. Anyway, never mind that. I've brought you something very nice. Here. Take it. How does it matter whether you take it before marriage... or after marriage. Take it. Take it in your hand. Listen. What? Will you tell me what the matter is? My bangles are lost. Your bangles are lost. They must be around. I searched every corner of the house. What? You searched the whole house? So, where have they gone? That's a hundred fifty rupees and you say they're lost? Ask the person who bought them how he feels. Why? What happened? Your daughter-in-law lost her gold bangles. That's very strange! Something goes missing from the house in broad daylight? And who goes in her room anyway? Either you or she herself. And sometimes Birju. But Birju wouldn't do such a thing. - Why not? - Don't you dare say that! - What did she say? - Nothing, mother. Greetings, aunty. Bless you, my girl. Bless you. Did Kamla send you here on an errand? No. I came here to demand sweets from sister-in-law. Sister-in-law, did you lose something? She lost her bangles today, my dear. Take this, aunt. Why did you have to hide, sister-in-law? You should have said clearly. Brother Birju gave them to Tulsi. How did you come across these bangles, my girl? What can I tell you, aunt? I haven't complained so far because of you. But he has made it difficult... for me to leave the house or go anywhere. He teases me all the time. I was returning from the field... when he accosted me and blocked in my path. And told me to take the bangles... and he said he brought them for me. You hear that, mother? This is the kind of son he is. And what would happen if uncle Bansi were to find out? I'll talk to him when he comes, my girl. He'll never tease you again. Okay, aunt, I'll go now. Goodbye. Bless you, my dear. Bless you. You see, mother? I had my doubts but I said nothing as I was afraid of you. Mother, anybody who can sell off the grain... and gamble with the money without fear won't care about the bangles. He's really doing you proud. Why are you hounding him? I'll scold him when he returns. You only scold him. Lord Krishna accosted me Tulsi! Lord Krishna accosted me I was disgraced on the street Lord Krishna accosted me Tulsi, I went to see the priest. Get that? Our birth charts match. And listen. Don't wear those bangles. Understand? Lord Krishna accosted me I was disgraced on the street Lord Krishna accosted me I was disgraced on the street Lord Krishna accosted me Never mind the song. To whom did you give this? What is this, mother? Of course. How would you know? Lord Krishna. I asked you who you gave your sister-in-law's bangles to. Sister-in-law's? I don't know, mother You should be ashamed of yourself, Birju. You are lying to my face. Do you want a beating even at this age? You're getting upset for nothing, mother. I told you once I don't know and you still ask me. You don't get it, mother. These bangles walked to Tulsi of their own accord. How would poor Birju know anything? Look mother, forbid brother Ramu from interfering. Of course. Nobody is to interfere in yourbusiness. Even if you bring disgrace to the entire family. You should be ashamed for stealing the bangles and giving them away Pay attention to me, Birju. If you do anything like this again... you'll have to deal with me. Get that? The female gender! Mother. Mother. Why did I steal it? Ever since sister-in-law has come to this house... he acts high and mighty all the time. Give me food. What have you cooked? I'll serve you what I've cooked. Why ask me? Quick, give it to me. If you were so desperate for the bangles... you could have asked me. This is how you cook food? The rice is half cooked, there's no salt or chilli. I eat once a day and even that's no good. What happened? He's hit you. You look after your house. I didn't come here for a beating. - I'm going to my house. - Sit down. Why are you going? He's young. He's your brother-in-law. Are brothers-in-law supposed to hit you with shoes? Lies! He didn't hit you with a shoe. He slapped you. Okay, you hit me. Hit me. Silly girl. Brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law have spats. That's no reason to be cross. You are cross. You are cross, my darling. You are cross My sweetheart, my sweetheart. You are cross You are cross. You are cross, my darling. You are cross Just go, I'm not your sweetheart My gloomy darling My sweetheart, my sweetheart. You are cross You are cross. You are cross, my darling. You are cross Let me embrace you, my cross one Stop patronizing me My pretty darling, my beautiful darling What good is this sweetheart? My sweetheart, my sweetheart. You are cross You are cross. You are cross, my darling. You are cross Sister Radha, I've been to your house. While there I learned you were at the barn. - Why? What's the matter? - Something unbelievable has happened. Send someone quickly or he'll mortgage it. Who'll mortgage what? Birju, of course. What's the matter, uncle? Son, Birju came to see me this morning... and told me to mortgage his share of the land. He said he needed two thousand rupees. I flatly refused. I asked him if he had sister Radha's permission. He told me it was none of my business. That he owned half of it. That he could keep it, sell it or set fire to it. I told him I couldn't keep it. Secondly I don't have that much money. He got upset and asked if... I was the only moneylender in the village? He said he'd mortgage it with Keshavmal. He said that and left. Ramu, go talk to him and bring him back. That's right, son, please go. What good will going there now do, mother? He must have mortgaged it already. No. Go take a look. It hasn't been too long. Ramu! Listen, my boy. Reason with him calmly. Don't get down to fist-fighting. Son, what is going on in your mind? I have already signed over the land to you. You could at least wait for me to die. How do I explain to you... the difficulties I endured to acquire this land? There was no difference between night and day. For whom is all this? For your happiness. Don't I have any joy in my life? Your father took away everything I had. You two mean everything to me now. If I were alone I would live off alms. Son, I request you not to do this as long as I live. Just let me live in peace. - Birju! - Ramu! Why did you mortgage the land? - Did you hear what I asked you? - Ramu? - I ask you, why did you mortgage the land? - Ramu! I needed money. - To gamble? - Yes. - Yes? - Ramu! Birju! Birju! Birju. Birju. - Move aside, mother! - No, no, Ramu! - Mother! - No! - Birju! - Ramu. - Give me the money. - Let him be. Don't fight. - Give me the money! - I don't have it. - Let it go! Ramu! Ramu! - Birju! Birju! - Ramu! Mother. Mother. Mother. My baby. My baby. My baby is gone. My Birju will not return. - Birju! - Mother. - Birju! - Mother! Birju! Please return. Look, your mother is calling out to you. Don't you have any compassion at all? Can't you hear the call of a heartbroken soul? Birju! God will never forgive you for this transgression. You are dashing an old mother's hopes by leaving. Birju! My baby! - Birju! - Mother. Mother. Mother, brace yourself. Calm down. Don't be so despondent, mother. Ramu, my hope is distancing itself from me. Go, bring back my hope for me. You are older. Coax your younger brother and bring him back. Go. My baby is annoyed with me because of you. Birju, mother is calling you. Briju, I'm not afraid of this. You'd be better off stabbing your mother with this knife. She'll be silenced forever. Birju, come back. Please forgive me. Brother! Brother Birju! Come back! I am destroyed, sister Radha. I've had it. Look, your Birju has written me a letter. My Birju has sent a letter? What has he written? He has written... He has written... Leave two thousand rupees at the old ruins at midnight. If you don't, I shall strangle you to death. Sister Radha, what should I do? Find some solution, sister Radha. He is your son. Try to recall your bad times. I helped you in times of need, sister Radha. I'd like the same favor from you now. Look, I don't have that much money. If it were a question of a few rupees... I'd manage it somehow and give it to him. How do I give him two thousand rupees, sister Radha? And I shall die even if I give it to him, sister Radha. Please save me somehow. The rascal didn't leave the money. What can the poor chap do? When it is time to die, the mind stops functioning. Let's go take it from his house. Who is it? Mother! Mother! Son. Mother! My mother! Mother. What brings you here, mother? Son, I came to see you son. Are you alright? Mother, you've lost a lot of weight. How did you know I was coming here? The rogue must have told her. Birju, have some mercy for the poor chap. He helped me in times of need. Mother, you have no idea. That old man is a scamp. He has oppressed people and amassed thousands of rupees. He's a tyrant, mother. If he's a tyrant, god will punish him, son. Why are you getting your hands soiled with blood? Mother, blood doesn't bother me anymore. These hands have become black... after being soiled with the blood of hundreds. Go home now, mother. No, my boy, I shall take you with me. No, no, mother! Don't be obstinate. Go! You are talking to your mother. Don't be so merciless. Don't forget this old mother raised you... and made you capable of holding the gun in your hand. But my boy, I didn't raise you... to do this after you grew up. I thought my Birju would grow up and bring me joy. He would be by my side when I die. I wouldn't die in the dark. My children's brightness will be in my eyes. I fall at your feet, son. Please have mercy. Give up all this. The villagers swear at your mother now. They curse me. They don't call me Radha aunty. Brave men don't play with toys of love. - No mother, please go! - Come with me. A mother's lap is always available for her child. Birju! I told you once not to interfere in my matters. I won't go. I'll take you with... - Mother! - Birju! Oh god! Can a child kill his mother? I didn't take one paisa by hurting anyone. I'm very innocent, goddess. - Greetings, uncle. Greetings. - Greetings. Welcome. Come sit. Sit. Brother Birju, my eyes would look all over for a glimpse of you. Brother, I received your letter. That's why I got delayed in answering it, uncle. So I hoped nothing untoward had happened. Oh no, god has been merciful. Keep that away. It will hurt. As for the answer, only I know... I can no longer write even one word. My hands tremble. I've been looking for you for many days now, son. I've arranged your marriage. I told sister Radha several times... of course, uncle. Of course. That's why I wanted to come see you. And collect everything uncle has amassed over the years. It will be useful at the wedding. Right, uncle? It's like this, uncle, you are old now. If you die in the middle of the night it will be a disaster. If some other walks away with everything... then your poor nephew will be left high and dry. I swear by your youth, brother... the house and property are yours. But I have no money whatsoever. The house is mine but I'm not to touch the hut. No, no. Well uncle, I'll tell these people to search the house. - Tell them, brother. - Okay, go and search the house. Search for it. It's your house. Search. So, tell me where is the cash, uncle? Cash? I have no cash. After uncle's... Damn you, uncle! Look! I'll chop you up into pieces like this. There's nothing in the safe. Where have you stashed it, old man? Look Birju, I have nothing. - Tell me. - I have nothing, Birju. - Tell me! - I don't. - Tell me! - I don't. This is appalling, Mr. Pandey. Sukhi Lala was killed yesterday. Who knows? We might be next. I can't sleep at night, brother. Living in this village has become difficult now. We can't think of a solution, Mr. Pandey. What's the solution? We don't know where they are. There is one solution, Mr. Pandey. We'll tell the villagers to gather and beat Radha and Ramu someday. - Then we'll know. - Yes, that's right! No. But I know they don't know, either. Rascals! You should be ashamed of yourselves. Scat! Get lost! lmps! - Shameless! Scram! - Let it be, son. Wait, wait. Try to understand. Understand what? Let me go. I'll break all their heads today. Brother Shamu's wife won't be treated cruelly... for as long as I am alive. Come to your senses. Come to your senses. You think you're the village headman? Who can defeat the boy's flunkies? Brothers, you should be ashamed of yourselves... for troubling my old mother. A few days ago you addressed her as aunt. Today you're pelting her with stones? It is very unfortunate. As time passes we too will pass, mother. Do you like it when people throw stones at you or abuse you? I can't tolerate this. Son, I shall remain in this house... waiting for your father for as long as I live. Lord knows when he might miss you. If I leave the house and he comes... the house will be deserted. Where will he go? Even they must be old by now. Nobody will even offer him water in this village. Look sir, he's been loitering around our den for a long time. When we asked him his name he tried to fool us. Take off his mask. - Birju. - Brother Ramu. Who invited you here? Nobody. An older brother has come to see his younger brother. I don't know of any brother. Leave. Birju, mother is on her deathbed. Lord knows she takes your name and cries all day long. She's at home all the time. Birju, the villagers have restricted her movements. All the boys throw stones at her. They shower abuse on her. They call her a witch and occultist. Birju, your mother is being tormented because of you. For the sake of god, come home. Give up all this. I'm saying it for your wellbeing. I am saying this for mother's sake, Birju. Brother Ramu, I'm not a child anymore... who might be affected by your sob stories. There's joy and sorrow in the world. These things don't bother me. - Go now. - Birju! I left the house determined to bring you home with me. Either you or I will survive today. Brother, you are married. It's a grave sin to willingly make your young wife a widow. It would be in your best interest to leave quietly. Birju. - I'll take you with me. - I am warning you. Leave! - You have to come with me, Birju. - I'm warning you. Leave! I'd like to see you stop me. Come. Talk. Will you come or won't you? Don't you dare! Escort him out. This isn't right, Birju. Come for your mother's sake if not for me. Concede. Concede now, Birju. Spruce up the bride for the groom is here The groom is here. The groom is here Spruce up the bride for the groom is here What are you doing, sister Radha? Your daughter's getting married and you're still at home? Get up. As though you didn't know. Why wouldn't I know, sister? But don't take me there. I heard that the villagers said they wouldn't come if I do. So what? Would my Tulsi's marriage stop if they don't come? Great! That's a good excuse you have. Get up. I didn't expect this of you. Kamla, I didn't come because I don't want friction... at the wedding because of one person. Wouldn't I attend Tulsi's wedding otherwise? Yeah, yeah. Get up, get up. Wedding chants Sister Radha. Radha. Then we can't stay here. Brother Bansi, you attend the wedding all on your own. We're leaving. Come on, brothers! Get up! Get up, get up! But will you tell me what the matter is, Lala? Did I make a mistake? 'Mistake.' You're asking us if you made a mistake? We warned you we wouldn't attend the wedding... if Radha attended. Come on, brothers! Get up! Get up! Let's go. What are you saying, Lala? Is sister Radha an untouchable? Is sister Radha an untouchable? She's worse than the untouchables. - The untouchables are better than her. - Yes. Sure Lala, you are right. The untouchables are better than me. Sister Kamla, I'm leaving. I already told you not to bring me here. No, no, this is impossible. Okay, okay, we'll leave. But brothers, what has sister Radha done? What has she done? She gets her son to plunder the village and commit murder. And you want to know what she's done? But brother, she is herself frustrated with that scoundrel... but she's helpless. Be careful. Restrain everyone until I get far away. Let's go. Let's leave. Let's leave. The wedding will only take place afterwards. - Let's go. - Let's go. Birju! - My daughter! My daughter! - Birju! What are you doing? Birju! Where are you taking her? Birju! - I'm ruined. - Birju! What are you waiting for? Go around the house and surround these people. Go! Why are you standing here? What are you waiting for? Shame on you cowards! You got scared of these four thieves? Nab these rascals! Hit them! Nab these rascals! Hit them! Hit them! Hit them! Hit them! - Birju, Birju, what are you doing? - Can't you see I'm getting married? You can't. She's another man's wife now. Brave men don't care. I won't let you take her away. Run, Tulsi, run! Sister Radha, I am destroyed. It is good thing. Serves you right for inviting sister Radha. Someday he'll carry you away, too. He went because of this witch. That's right. Tell her to bring him back. If they don't bring him, then burn down her house. That's right! That's right! I'll take my Tulsi back from you. Help me. I'll bring her. I will surely bring her. You'll bring her? When will you bring her? When he brings disgrace to this village! In any case, who'll marry her now? No. My Birju is not evil. Hit her! How dare you lord over me! Don't you dare. Birju! Ramu! Ramu! Birju! Birju! Birju! Birju! Birju! Birju! For the love of god, please don't take her. - Leave me alone, mother. - Birju! Birju! Birju! Birju! Kamla has only one child. I won't let you snatch someone's child... because god will snatch my child. Birju! Birju! - Out of my way, mother! - Birju! - Move, mother! - Birju! Birju! Birju! Don't take Tulsi away! I've given my word to the villagers. Here, mother. Mother, your Birju has kept your word. God upheld your word. Mother... What have you done, mother? A woman gave her word to the villagers. She fulfilled it. Kamla. Here. Mother! God, you snatched a son from his mother... to defend another woman's honor. Now defend the mother's dignity, too. Mother! Mother! - Mother! - Mother! - Mother! - Mother!
