This is the man who steals our bread. Go to hell! Hey, sleepyhead. Wake up! Good morning. - Did you sleep well? - Yes, daddy. Get up and go to work! Ouch, ouch! Bye, dad. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Charming... I like you very much. Miss... - Why don't you tell your friend... - Just go away. After all, we don't like guys who ride on bicycles! I get it. You prefer cars... - Of course! - We'll buy a car then. - Good morning. - Good morning, madam. - Good morning, madam. - Good morning. Tell me, Mariuccia, has he been following you for long? - I didn't see him. - You didn't notice, eh? As if the men didn't exist for you. I think he's a nice guy. Enough now. Come on, we're late. - Hey there. How are you? - Hi. - What are you doing? - I'm taking the car today. You have permission from the boss? That one never goes out. - Bruno! - What? Call for you. - Who is it? - The boss. Damn... Hello? Bruno? Have the car here today at 1 pm. Well, sir... The spark plugs are dirty. The spark plugs? Change them! Yes... I should add that the car is broken. Broken? - But it'll be ready for tomorrow. - Tomorrow? No doing! - My wife needs the car today. - Let it go. We'll just take Olga's car. As if we didn't have our own. Alright, alright, tomorrow then. You see? - So? - Nothing. What time is it? 11:05 am. - 90, 112... - Good day, madam. - Shall I come today? - No, we will deliver tomorrow. - Thanks. - Goodbye. Goodbye, madam. - Goodbye, madam. - Goodbye, girls. - Where are you going today? - Me? To the Lakes. Oh, here he is. And you, Mariuccia, where are you going today? - Nowhere. - See? You could go bicycling with that guy we saw this morning. - Bye, Mariuccia. - Bye. - Bye, Mariuccia. - Bye. Look, miss... I bought this just for you. Yes, I did. May I drive you home? There is no harm in it. But, quick. This is one-way street. I will get fined. Yes? Where to? - Corso Sempione. - Fine. Where are we going? - Where are you taking me? - We're just going for a little ride. Don't be afraid. - Slow down! - Don't worry. - Where are you we going? - To the Lakes! - The Lakes? You're mad! It's far away. - Have you ever been there before? - No, I haven't. - Good. You'll see. We'll be there in an hour. Here... I told you it was worth the trip. Wonderful... Now, we'll take the steamboat. - Are you tired? - A little bit. Let's sit down here. No... Leave me alone. Let's go home, shall we? It's getting late. - Why? Somebody is waiting for you? - No. So, let's pull up here and have a drink. - No, no. - Yes, yes. Waiter! Ham, Muscat and... biscuits. More! Well done. - Do you smoke? - No, thanks. Let's take a look. Ah, "Mari첫"! - I know this song. - Do you? Lovely. It's about you: Mariuccia. - They are good dancers. - Funny. Here, on your heart I don't suffer anymore. How beautiful you are, more than ever this evening, Mari첫! la, la, la, your blue eyes. Even if the fates should be contrary tomorrow Today I am with you, why be sad? Speak to me of love, Mari첫! I live only for you! Your lovely eyes shine brightly. They flash with a dreaming fire! Tell me that this is no illusion. Tell me that you are all mine! Here, on your heart I don't suffer anymore. Speak to me of love, Mari첫! - Bravo! - Thank you. - Another one? - No, no, thanks. - Have a nice day. - Bye. Those brats! Please, wait a minute. I'll be right back. Bruno, what are you doing here? You said the car was broken? Yes, but I repaired it. Then I went out to test it and... I stopped here. Well done! We've come at the right moment! Get out of car. Come Olga. We'll have more space now. - See you later then? - Yes, yes. Bruno, let's go. Goodbye. Go to the terrace, tell the young lady sitting alone that I'll be back shortly. Bruno, let's go. Hurry up! Oh, my God, what a wild ride! - It goes in the garage? - Yes. Damn! - Look, my trolley is wrecked! - You were in the middle of the road! - You must keep to the right side. - I was keeping to the right side! - Oh, you, good. - Calm down. - Your papers, please. - Here they are. - I need to go to Arona. I'm in a hurry. - You're not moving from here. - But I really have to. - Enough! The street has to be cleared as soon as possible. - But I... - Enough, I said! I'm sorry, miss, but we have to close. - That's all I have. - I get it. Please, wait a moment. You're not paying, eh? Where did that young man go? You understand... If I don't go home before my dad goes back tomorrow morning... I'm ruined. Because, I swear, madam, it's the first time... Mom! I can give her a lift tomorrow. - What are you doing there? - Oh, madam, you would save me! The lady can spend the night in a separate room. - Keep quiet! - It doesn't matter to me! All I need is to get back in Milan in time! There now... Tell Rosa to make a bed. Thanks. Thanks, madam. Come on, stop crying. The same happened to me. What Scoundrels Men Are! If you only knew what happened to me... Long ago, before my husband, that kind soul, passed away, I met a young, handsome man, he wooed me and wooed me... - See? On time. - Bravo. Thanks. Bye. Will you pay us a visit? - I'm the owner. - Really? - May I? - Oh, thanks. Come on, sleepyhead, wake up! Mariuccia? - Did you sleep well? - Yes, yes, dad. Get up and go to work! As for the trolley, if you have confidence in me... I could pay in monthly installments. - Monthly installments?! The trolley... And my car! My destroyed car! My smashed car, who is going to pay for it? Listen, I've already told you: clear off! Here is 100 liras, your wages have now been paid. Now, get out! Get out! Goodbye, sir. Please, come with me... This one? No! Goodbye. - The cyclist is here. - Where? Outside. What an insolent! - You're an incorrigible flirt! - I didn't do anything. Stay here. Here! This one, miss. Let's go. - I have to pay. - Go pay, come on. - Mariuccia, listen... - Can I help you? - Last night I couldn't... - Can I help you? How can I help you? A perfume, please. - Eau de Cologne? - Yes. This one? Yes. - 120. - No, no. I prefer this one. I understand. A women's perfume. Indeed. 140. This one. Listen, Mariuccia. Last night, I...

How does it work? - Works like this. - What a temper! - Go elsewhere, please. I realized you are not like other girls. You are a good girl. Am I right, Mariuccia? Well... - I have to go back to work. - And try not to lose it this time! - Bye. - Have a nice day. No! As you can see, gentlemen, today, the same stream intensity needed to operate a doorbell, the electric doorbell each of you have in your own home, is enough to activate any of these pumps. Please, look. This is just amazing! One. Two. Please. Please, come here, madam. Have a try yourself. See yourself. One. Two. Wonderful! Even a foreign girl, who doesn't speak our language, can easily operate this machine. - For you, miss. - Thanks. DEAR GINA, I WILL PICK YOU UP AT 11 PM TONIGHT.

What are you afraid of? Are they going to eat you? You need people like them in life. Not guys like your sweetheart. If you don't come with us, they can fire him. Enough now! Please work! The same stream intensity enough to operate a small electric doorbell, comfortably sitting at your desk, no need to get up... We've proved the functionality and the usefulness of our pump. Please. If I had to talk about the possibilities in the field of irrigation, I would have so much to tell you about. And... Closing now! That would be all for tonight. We'll speak again tomorrow. Advance? - Tomorrow at 8 am sharp. - Don't worry. Good night. She's not here. Right. She went home. - Good night. - No. She did not go home. She went with some gentlemen. They are at the amusement park. What's more... Good night. Come on, that kind of girl is not for you. There you need a car... and a big stack of cash. Let's go have a drink? Why? - Bad taste in your mouth? - Me? - You think that I, for that girl... - Yes, I think you would... - Did you know that you're pretty? - You realize it only now? Hands off! Rude man!

Two cups of coffee. - So nice here, isn't it? - Yes. And also, this year there are some interesting presentations... Shall we dance? Let's dance. You too, miss. - No, thank you. - Come on, dance! - Miss... - Thanks. Drink, Mariuccia! Shall we dance? - Another dance? - No, thanks. But, Bruno... - Forgive me, sir. - Please. Listen... Shall we go now? I live far away. We shall not miss the last tram. Yes. Bruno... - What do you want? - Come on! You'd better go now. They're waiting for you. And you have to be kind with them to get where you want. Go, drive! Bruno! Crocodile tears. All you women are the same! Why did you go with such people? Why? What a fool I am. Mariuccia... Mariuccia, let's get married! You know how much I love you. No more perfumery, OK? You'll be staying at home... cooking risotto! What is he doing? Why did he stop? Let's go, Mariuccia. You're back home. - Dad... - Get out. Let's go, young man. Get out! - I'm a good guy. - Yes, he is. Be quiet! But I am a good guy. Are you coming or not?
