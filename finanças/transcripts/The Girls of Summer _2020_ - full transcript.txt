There's a certain delicacy in life that I've learned from growing sod, a level of discernment. With rain, there's a heaviness, a weight that calls for extra strength. With drought, there's a tenderness required to prevent crumbling. There are elements out of our control. And it is always how we react these elements that makes all the difference. We're not always ready for it. We don't always get it right. But as it is with sod, we can replant those seeds and try again. I wanna leave by six. Okay. Tomorrow Grace heads off to North Carolina for college and Cali to San Francisco for an internship at an art gallery. They're excited, and I'm happy for them. But that also means that tonight's our last performance as The Girls of Summer. 20 minutes. Oh, this is so weird. It's actually pretty common. Is Dad up? No. Peanut butter or bologna? Peanut butter. Not bologna. - Maren? - Hey Dad. I just wanna let you know that we're about to head out soon. But I understand if you're not feeling up for it. It's 6:15? No, but Grace wants to leave earlier. Get some sleep, okay? - Shotgun. - No. ♪ Well you broke my heart in Memphis ♪ Gracie, the second verse to the last line, I changed it.

Hey listen, give Danny and Wayne another round of applause, all right? Danny and Wayne, thanks guys. Hey look, let me just mention that Luke Thomas is in the house tonight and he's right here with us. Hey Luke. Say hey Luke! Hey Luke! All right. Now, um, I got uh... The Taylor Sisters coming up here now. That's Maren and Grace Taylor. And this is so cute. They have put down, uh, given me a chord chart so I can play along with them. So come on girls.

And unfortunately their pizzazz ends tonight. That one, Grace, is college bound. Hm, I'm sure you all will miss her. Yeah. I'm leaving, too. Out of sight, out of mind, you know? It'll just be that one. I'm sorry, I don't know why I'm telling you this. I'm gonna go. Wait, really? My band's actually looking for a new drummer. Let me get her number. ♪ 'Til you came and took me ♪ ♪ And made me see what it's like to be whole ♪ Oh, you got a message. Yeah. Cali. What's up? You gave Luke Thomas my phone number? Hmm. - Cali. - What? He caught our set and his band's looking for a drummer. Yeah but his band is also going on tour. Yeah. Isn't that cool? A comeback tour. Why would you tell him I'd be interested? What, are you mad at me now? You know I can't do that. Is it seriously your dream to take over the farm? What, you're gonna give up music to roll sod for the rest of your life? I don't wanna talk about this right now. - Dad'll be fine. - You don't know that, Grace. - Love you. - Love you too, Dad. You be good, all right? In school, I once read this quote by Atticus. "Depression is being colorblind" "and constantly told how colorful the world is." After you've lost your colors, dad's begin to dim. The more you drink, the more Xanax prescribed, the more hollow my attempts to point out the colors became. Unlike fall, when the color of the leaves disappear with the promise to return, his colors were held captive by the frost of winter. The bitter truth leaving no spring in sight. Sorry, was I too loud? You gotta go. I hear you playing night after night. This is your dream. And you gotta go for that dream like your life depends on it. 'Cause it does. Now go on. Play. Hi, hello? Hi, it's Maren Taylor from Decoy's a while back. I think you talked to my sister Cali Taylor? Good. I was just wondering, are you guys still looking for a drummer?

I agree. You can really hear Maren through her songs. Funnel cake? Oh, it's hot. What were you like in high school? - Uh... - You don't have to answer. No, I was an only child. Both my parents worked, so had a lot of time on my own. - I had friends. - That's good. Started a few terrible bands. - Garage bands? - Basement bands. - Whoa, that's even worse. - What about you? Oh, um... - Scared. - Of what? Everything. My mom passed away when I was 13. I'm sorry, what happened? She just couldn't live in this world anymore. Must've been tough at that age. Yeah, it was. I used to have really bad panic attacks. Like, so bad that my dad and sisters would sit on me. Really? Yeah, to calm me down. But they went away. Which is good, 'cause my dad is not a scrawny man, and my sisters both have kinda bony butts, so you can imagine how my spine would just be... I've never done this before. Oh. Hey, hey. It's okay. We don't have to do anything. I'm embarrassed. Maren, don't be. The first time's a big deal. It's supposed to be special. Especially for you. Morning. Someone's looking awfully chipper this morning.

Came to see the band, but you were the one he liked. He wants to talk. He's in the bar next door. Don't be long. - Hey. - Hey. I liked your song. I was moved by it. Thanks. I'm guessing it was about me. It's a good guess. Look, I'm flattered, but I don't think I can reciprocate that level of... Look, if I could have that kind of love, it'd be with you. I don't think that's in the cards for me right now. I wish it was. I don't want to make empty promises, you don't deserve that. Hope you're not mad at me. Look, you're young, you know?

I totally forgot about that. Well lucky for you he didn't. Call him. I struggle with the idea that everything happens for a reason. I mean, how can something so beautiful be destroyed so quickly? What am I supposed to learn from this? That I'm naive? The worst part is my naivety is probably what's keeping me from experience. Like a song on a continuous loop. And now all I wanna do is shrink. Shrink back to my natural size. 'Cause anything more than that... Dad, I'm home. Dad? Dad? Of course. Dad? Dad, wake up! Is there anything I can do for you? Thank you, though. Hey. I'm sorry, okay? Not you too, okay? Yeah, I promise. - Hey. - Oh. Just using the bathroom. I made us lunch. I'm not hungry, but thank you. You remind me of her so much. Because I love peanut butter? No. I think that there's this idea that if we move on from something, that we're indirectly saying that it didn't matter to us or that it didn't exist. But I don't think that's true. We know you loved her. Is that chili? No, it's actually quite warm. Mmm, whoa, flavor... town. So you weren't gonna tell us? There was nothing you could've done. I didn't want you guys to feel like you had to come home. That's not up to you. Push the throttle. I've had enough sun for the day. You all right? Yeah, gonna watch some TV. So I've realized for my internship that I actually kind of do enjoy human interaction, believe it or not. Oh, wow Cali. You know what that reminds me of? When the Grinch's heart grew three times its size. But you live on a sod farm, not a tiny little Christmas town, and you have a big cow, not a little dog. And your heart really can't grow. Are you done? Please be done. Hey, whatever happened to that guy? - Which one? - Not you. - Luke, right? - Oh yeah. What did happen with him? Just wasn't the one, I guess. Excuse me, I was definitely talking about his band. You and Luke Thomas were a thing? Kinda. I won't wanna talk about it. Well, there's plenty more fish in the pool. Thank you. Well, I think we should get our band back together. Soon. Only if we go on tour, 'cause I am already so fucking tired of all this sod! Go big or go home, baby. Literally though. A talent agent did wanna talk to me. - Maren! - What! - Oh my God. - Seriously. Stop being such a little baby bitch. Easy now. Leave the smack talk to me, okay? I know, I'm bad at it. All right, fine. I'll call him. You wanna do a shot with me while you wait? No. No, I'm okay, thanks. - You sure? - Yeah. Is it the type of whisky? We have others. No, I'm okay, thank you. Uh, I will totally drink that shot. All right. - Maron. - Maren. Maren! - Fisher Cobb. - Please call me Fish. - Nice meeting you. - So what are we havin'? I feel like green tea today. Got it. Geez.

We're gonna be opening up the phone lines for the next 10 minutes, so if you'd got something you'd like to ask, now would be the time to call. What do you say, Maren? Are you ready to let our listeners in? - Oh boy! - Okay. Let's get started, phones are ringing. Caller one, you're on the air. Hi, just wanted to say that I lost my virginity to your song. Awesome. - Thank you. - No, thank you. Okay, next caller. You're on the air. Hi Maren, Jonathan here. Hi Jonathan. Well I'm a little dismayed, because I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but a lot of your lyrics are dripping in post-modern misogyny. So I'm just wondering, you know, are you aware of how much you hate men, or is this an unconscious catharsis of childhood trauma or something? That's a loaded question! You know, I'd probably take years of psychoanalyzing to fully get to the bottom of that. But I'm pretty sure I don't hate men, but I appreciate your concern, hope you have a great day. - Bye. - Wow. Next caller, you're on the air. I can really hear you through your songs. Hello caller, are you still there? Well that was nice. All right, that's all the time we have for calls. Before you go, Maren, I'm sure our listeners would love to learn the origins of this song. This is gonna be so good. It's gonna be so so good. - Is it? - Yes. - Is it though? - Yes. It's gonna be amazing. And we're gonna sell a lot of records. I hope so. You don't have to hope. We'll put the work in. You just never know what the people want.
