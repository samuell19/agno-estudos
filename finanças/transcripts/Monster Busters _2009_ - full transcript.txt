For days I'd been hunting the Shadow Monster. I knew it was my last chance. I had to catch it, before something dreadful happened. The monster had - - possessed its victims, one by one - - and made them do terrible things. But due to my special power - l - I could sense the monster before I could see it. And so I succeeded, in the nick of time - - in getting it. - Did the monster die? - No. You can't kill a shadow monster. So what did you do? The only thing you can do. I froze it. Stop filling their heads with nonsense. They'll get nightmares. It's not nonsense. Grandpa really was a monster buster. Right? - What did you do with the monster? - Put it in the freezer. Bummer! Nothing but ice cream and schnapps. Listen, I put it in a special deep freezer. Only Chicken over there and I know where. - Cut it out! They believe you. - I don't. Wuss! Lasse, leave Oliver alone. It's great to be able to be afraid. But he's 12! He should get a grip! What good is a scared big brother? Being a daredevil isn't brave at all. - Dinner's served. - Sit down. Oliver, bring a chair. Yummy. It's not fair to make the guests cook the meal. It's not fair we have to eat this. Organic rye pudding is good for you. This morning I ran my 20 kilometers in 68 minutes flat. How stupid. The baker's right around the corner. - Grandpa, are you okay? - Sure, I'm fine. Tom, tell him to stop. He's scaring the boys. - Stop it, Dad. - He's just kidding. Right, Grandpa? - He's not kidding. - I don't feel well. - Grandpa! - Call an ambulance. Breathe. Are you okay? MONSTER BUSTERS - Yeah, they have to run a lot of tests. So we're staying in his giant house and babysitting his cat. Cool! You can turn the sound way up when you watch horror movies. Hide! Philip's coming! - Hi, girls. - Phew! He didn't see us. - Why don't you stand up to him? - Are you crazy? Then we're dead meat. If I were the big brother, I'd show him! Luna, it's going to be fine. - Bye. - Bye, sweetie. - Cool. What are you gonna wear? - It's just a school party. - Don't you want to score? - You aren't going to score. How do you know? Before we begin - - I'd like to introduce your new class mate. - Tell the class about yourself. - My name is Luna. Hi. Hi. Hi. We just moved here, me and my dad. I like reading books. I play the cello. ''I play the cello.'' Funky! You can sit down now. Well, kids. This is it. Put on your safety glasses. Glasses on. For remember: - Better safe ... - Than sorry. Gee, kids. This experiment is really dangerous. But I lose my nerve. Whenever I get insecure, I lose my nerve. What if you had to do something that scared you? I can't. Is it like someone is controlling you? But no one is, Soeren. - Are you okay? - Yes. Okay, I think we'll call it a day. - Phew! - See you tomorrow. Whoops, better get those with you. Bye. Peacekeepers keep their diet. Qlling all cars. A wrong-way vehicle has been sighted on the highway. Copy that, over. That's a code 438, if ever I heard one. Torben, do we know our code 438? Sure ... - Just take your time. - A code 438 is ... - A wrong-way vehicle. - And? - Failure to observe signs. - Yes. We have to go, Torben. There. - And we're going to drive fast, but ... - Carefully. - Exactly! Way to go. - Unit 49, what's keeping you? We're on our way, over and out. There are nuts and fresh carrot sticks in the fridge, if you need a snack. - Don't hesitate to call us. - Relax. What could happen? - It's your first time alone here. - No problemos. Grandpa sends his love. He's okay. - He's looking forward to seeing us. - So am I. Have fun, boys. Look after your big brother. Look after your little brother. Bye, dear. Remember, don't hesitate to call. We're right ... Don't invite too many chicks over, okay? This one or this one? This one or this one? - You're not allowed to watch them. - So what? We're home alone. - That means I'm in charge. - You're such a funk. Why can't you play Warcra–Ø like everyone else your age? Help me make a den. Gonna make room for a makeup table and a Barbie play corner too? - What's that? - Don't know. Move the chair. - Hey, maybe it's a monster dungeon. - Yeah right, Lasse. Wow! - Want to go down? - We'd better ask Grandpa first. Look. Lasse, look. It's Grandpa as a young man. And here. He's in all of them. Cool. I told you. Grandpa was a monster buster. Or maybe this is where he makes up all his stories. DO NOT EVER OPEN OR TURN OFF! That's where Grandpa hides the shadow monster. The shadow monster isn't real. Well, open the freezer then. He must have had a reason for putting up that sign. - He wants to preserve something. - His first snowball? We're not going to touch it. Look at these awesome weapons. How did you know that was going to happen? You had your back turned. I don't know. I was just lucky, I guess. Morning, boys. - Ready for a new day? - When are we going to visit Grandpa? - Tomorrow. - Yes! Gee. Lasse wants to hear some more monster stories. - Okay. - Stop that, honey. Better in here, where we're together. Why does your grandpa have a secret basement? - What are you whispering about? - Nothing. I'm going to find out. - Scared, Ollie? - Listen up, kids. The queen ant has a noticeably large abdomen. There's only room for one queen ant in an anthill. When the anthill reaches a certain size, something happens. What? - Marcus? - Nerd! - She produces flying ants. - That's right. How? She mates to produce more queens. I didn't know Marcus was an expert on ant porn. Marcus is perfectly right. In one night, a single queen like that can produce thousands of new queens. How did you find the basement? - He can hear us. - I heard you. - Great! - Sorry. - Where's that secret basement at? - Don't tell him. Okay, you know the drill. That's it, rub it in, Ollie. You look so much better. It really suits you. You're good enough to eat now. Why doesn't your big brother resist? - Got any fries to go with that? - Zip it, Barbie! Let's go. What a bunch of nerds. Hi. Are you okay? - Let's go home to my place. - Haven't you got scouts? Never mind. Lasse, you have to go home alone. Look out before you cross the street. - Where are you going? - To talk to Philip. - What do you want? - Leave my big brother alone. - What's in it for me? - My allowance. - Not enough. - What then? Show me the basement, and I'll think about it. - I can't. - Then I can't promise you anything. - What does he take me for? - Promise to leave him alone then? Sure. A deal's a deal. - What a load ofjunk. - It's notjunk, it's equipment. My grandpa used to be a monster buster. - And my grandma was a Zulu king. - It's true! He's got a monster trapped in the freezer. That's why you can't open it. - You believe in Santa too? - A little. - Don't! - Shut up. - It's dangerous! - Get lost, Lasse. What the hell is that? It's a monster. Drop the fairytale crap. Do you see any monster? - There is something there. - Sure, some old leftovers from WW2. You'll leave Oliver alone now, right? Sure, I'll leave Oliver alone. - For the rest of the day. - But we had a deal. I said I'd leave him alone, but not for how long. It's been a blast. Especially your grandpa's frozen old lunch. See ya, Lasse. Yuck! - Bedtime, boys. - The movie isn't over yet. - So what? They're kissing. - You have a big day tomorrow. - Why? - The parent-teacher interview. Don't think of it as an exam. It's meant to help Dad and me help you, if you have any problems. In that case, get a pumpgun and a shampoo that removes relish. I promise I won't be late from work - - so you don't have to be embarrassed by your lame parents. - Great. - Off to bed. - I'll tuck you in. - I'll be up to kiss you goodnight. L-U-N-A. - Lasse. Are you okay? - Sure. Why? - I've got a bad feeling. - What's wrong? I guess it's just me. Sleep tight. - Aren't you going for a run? - I don't wanna today. Oh, come on! - Cheers, Daddy! - It's not funny. Don't do that again. Have you gone crazy? You're disgusting. No, thanks. - When are we gonna visit Grandpa? - I don't wanna today. Sick people are just so depressing. We can't be bothered. Not today. Anyway, there's a game on. - Did you pack our lunches? - I've gotta do my hair. How about not going to school today? Life is too short for school. Shake my booty. - Bon appetit, buddy. - Tom. - Have a look. - What's up with them? - Think I should get a boob job? - I guess it's the mid-life crisis. - Mid-life crisis? - Mom and Dad are 40 now. At that age many people want to try out new stuff, be someone else - - fall in love and go skydiving. - So their crises hit at the same time? - I guess so. Or maybe they've been possessed by Grandpa's Shadow Monster. What? I'm so sorry. I never should've let him in. You watch too many horror movies. The only thing that came out of that old freezer is water. But you had a bad feeling last night. I just had a nightmare. After school we'll go see Grandpa, and he can tell you he made it all up. Grandpa, stop it. He believes you. It's not my fault your parents are acting strange. So the Shadow Monster is for real? - He told you a million times already. - So all your stories ... are true? I told you! Grandpa is a monster buster. You have to get the monster back in the freezer. No way! I'm not gonna hunt down any monster. - Only you can do it. - But you're the monster buster. - Yes, but ... - I'll do it. Oliver's a wuss. It doesn't take courage to be a monster buster. - What does it take then? - A special power. - What kind of power? - The power to sense danger. Before seeing it. He caught an axe before he saw it fall. That's the power you need to catch a shadow monster. Is that why I can sense Philip's presence? - Philip? Is he dangerous? - As hell! Oliver. I didn't want to tell you all this before you turned 18. But I have to tell you everything now. Sit down. You see ... - I won't do it. I'm too scared. - What about Mom and Dad? With crazy parents we can drop doing our homework and eat what we like. - What if it's contagious? - They only kiss each other. - And us. - Wejust have to avoid their kisses. - Come on, baby. - Alright already! Screw the parent-teacher interview. I wanna watch Strictly Come Dancing. Hi, Ollie Bollie. - Puberty hits hard. - Give Mommy a kiss. You look good today, honey! Oliver is a nice boy. A great kid. We are very fond of him. Oliver ... Academically, Oliver ... I was head of my class, too. I think he got it from me. We're so happy to hear that you were a good student. Oliver ... Let me just open the window. You just had dinner, I pres... Well, joking aside. Oliver is doing just fine - - when is comes to Math and English. - His grades show ... - Mom. - Mom, you're gonna get cold. - What? - Mom, please. - So I need someone to warm me. I'd also like to add that Oliver seems to be happy ... Yes! Gotcha! - He's not going anywhere now. - Oh, handcuffs! Don't overdo the homework, okay? Hey, you dropped something. - Mom, come on. - Alright. I'm just so interested in your education. - Hi. - Luna's dad. - Oliver's mom. - Mom, let's go. Okay. Hope to see you again soon. - Dad, buckle up. - No, it's too tight. God damn it, people park like crazy! Comfy back there, kids? Honey ... I can't put on my makeup when you drive like this. - Let's have some fun, baby. - Drive carefully! Look out! You'll end up killing someone. Let's go look at those balloons we talked about tomorrow, honey. - Drop me off here. - Why? I need to talk to Grandpa. Oliver, you can't do it alone. Gather a team of people you trust and get them to help you. You'll find all the equipment you need in the basement. Scare guns, free2e cannons free2ing liquid - - books and whatever else you need. If there's only one monster, how can several people be possessed? Let's say this is the shadow monster - - and this is someone possessed. If the possessed person kisses someone ... kissy-kissy ... - Okay, we get it. - Okay. It leaves a copy of itself right before it possesses the next one. - More monsters, more crazy people. - And dangerous. - But only the Queen can reproduce. - Like the ants. Right. You've got your copies and your Queen. Only she can make new monsters, so we've gotta catch her first. - Where is the Queen now? - Inside my mom. - How do we get it out? - There are several methods. - But this is the best. - Okay. Are you crazy? I was an inch from shitting my pants! - It only fires blanks. Just to scare it. - So what's it good for? If you scare the possessed person, the monsterjumps back out. And then we have to be ready - - with these. Ready. - Don't use it all. - Crap! Why can't we just punch it in the nose and get it over with? - Maybe it's because she's a girl. - Zip it, Lasse! Or else I'm gonna fire a load of slush ice up your nose! - If you can hit. - If I can hit? I can hit that one! - And that one! - Go easy! Oliver, fire away the monster. There! Anything else? Okay, ready? I feel so insecure. It's as if people ignore me. Then panic grips me - - and I think I'm going to be attacked. Something is wrong. My mom must still have the Queen. - Leave it to me. - No! What on earth are you doing? Just look at my hair. Geez! - She couldn't hear us. - We need to practise some more. - Is this the right way? - How long have you been a cop? - One year. - My 25th anniversary is this summer. Give these idiots a ticket. And bring your cuffs. They drive like crazy! - Let's call an ambulance. - What's got into you? I'll show you! I just turned the neighbor's plastic stork into a giant popsicle. - Empty. - Now we're all out. I told you! We just had the briefest career as monster busters ever. Maybe. This is the school chemistry depot, where they keep liquid nitrogen. Freezing liquid. We have to wait. Cut it out! I've had it. Let's kick the door in. Luna, wait. I just ... Maybe ... Please don't think ... My mom just ... Yesterday ... - I don't get a word you're saying. - Never mind. - What are you doing? - Waiting. For what? Stupid brats! Guffe, watch the kids. I'm going into the depot. Stay! Bite them, if they make a move. Guffe, look. - Catch! - See ya. - Go get it! - Guffe, come back! - Guffe, come back! - Hurry! Okay, let's get that monster out of my mom. Hurry. The janitor's coming back, hurry! - Mine isn't full yet. - Never mind, we have to go! Hurry! Take the back door. Hi, Ollie Bollie. Give your sexy mom my love. - Did he kiss your mom? - Maybe. Were you inside the depot? Were you, you stupid brats? - No. - Here it comes, Ronaldinho! Yes! That's what people want to see! Have you gone completely mental? You're kind of cute when you're angry. Love those lips. - Sexy, full janitor lips. - Look, Niels. We've got certain school rules at this school, you know. Let's go see the doctor, Guffe. I need a band-aid. He's got the Queen now. It has escaped! Get it! Over there! I've got it. Hurry! Come on. - What now? - Just in case. You could've called and told me you were going to waste the monster. Be glad no one got hurt. It's like dressing up for Halloween, and then your friends eat the treats. If Niels had kissed someone, we'd have monsters all over the place. Then we wouldn't stand a chance. - Now what? - Time to depossess Mom and Dad. They won't be home until tomorrow. Mom's at a party, and Dad's on duty. So we have to wait until tomorrow. Let's see what happens when natrium combines with water. It explodes. You look like morons. Get those stupid glasses off. This isn't dangerous. That's not true. If the teacher says it isn't dangerous, just shut your trap. Right, nerd? Chill out, Marcus. Oliver would sense, if it was dangerous. That's way too much. Look out! - Whoops. - Man! - Why didn't you sense it? - I don't know. - She's possessed. - But we've frozen the Queen. - If it is the Queen. - How can you tell? - By using this. - How? - The Queen is flourescent. - What? If you turn on an ultraviolet lamp in the dark - - the Queen lights up. Let's see if it works. - Chicken! - Please let it be the Queen. My undies give off more light. - Crap! It's just a copy. - Dorte must have the Queen. Hi. I'm giving a cello recital at the church tonight before the party. - The whole school's invited. Coming? - Well ... We can go to the party afterwards. I just thought you ... What Oliver is trying to say is, we'd like to, but we may be busy. Okay. What's the deal with you and Luna? She's going to electrocute it! We've got to save it. Oliver, help us. - What about Dorte? - We'll take care of her later. - But she mustn't kiss anyone else. - Hide behind the desk! What the hell is that? Cool. Don't! No! Stop! - What's going on? - I tried to stop them. Guffe ... Guffe. Guffe! - Break-in, vandalism, animal abuse. - Yes! - It wasn't us, you hear? - I have to talk to your parents. - Until then you're expelled. - Can't we come to the party? No! No. Get lost, you stupid brats! I've got my eye on you. Marcus, you forgot your book. If Dorte kissed someone, we don't know where the Queen is. Or how many are possessed. - It's not mine. - I know. But since you're not coming to the party, here's a goodbye kiss. - Where are you going? - To get a haircut. What? What's going on? - We've still got these. - The janitor emptied them. - They're just a bunch of toys now. - What about Mom and Dad? We've got to think of something! I was really looking forward to that party. Okay, Sofie. Want a taste of Daddy's killer fist? I've got it! - We'll get Luna to help us. - Luna? - She can steal some freezing liquid. - And some painkillers. It is my great pleasure to introduce Luna Heiberg - - who is going to perform The Swan from The Carnival of the Animals. - Why are you late? - I had to do my hair. - What's that smell? - My dad's after-shave. - Why? - The girls dig it. - Hey, why haven't we ever kissed? - Because we're friends. So? I'd like to. - Well, I wouldn't. - Come on. - Marcus, have you kissed anyone? - Jealous? No. Did you kiss anyone at school today? Yeah, Anna. But I bet you're a better kisser. - Marcus kissed Anna! Let's get out. - Why? He's possessed! Come on. Marcus, go away. I mean it! - Just a little kiss, Sofie. - No! - I'm going to punch you! - I hope I never hit puberty. - Leave her alone. - You've got to scare him! it. - If I get possessed, we're screwed. Okay, Lasse. Let's go. Marcus, where are you? Marcus, this isn't funny! Marcus, stop it. Where are you? No, let go! - What happened? - Are you okay? I'm sure they had a reason to leave. If you keep crying, you're going to get your cello full of snot. Let me just find you a tissue, okay? Okay, sweetie. - We need to talk to Luna. - It's important. - So tell me what it's about. - It's hard to explain. - She can't kiss anyone at the party. - Oh? Why not? - She might be possessed. - Hey, are you born-again Christians? - Are we? - It's really important. I bet. - Wasn't that CD for Luna? - I forgot. - What is it? - Han-Na Chang, a famous cellist. I want a real big brother! SORRY WE HAD TO LEAVE P.S. DON'T KISS ANYONE! Wait! Han-Na Chang, thanks! I didn't know you were a fan of Han-Na Chang too. Sure, he's great. She. Han-Na Chang is a woman. Oh, sure. She. She's great. Want to go with me to the party? Okay. See, making friends is easy. After him. This is crazy. I was about to be discharged. I don't get it. I just had an earache. I hate Dr. Lund. I hate him! - Where's our grandpa? - In surgery. - They did the surgery already. - The doctor knows what he's doing. The case sheet for Dr. Lund. Better you than me! - What's up, gorgeous? - Your next patient is Peter Hansen. He had an unstable heart, but he's almost fully recovered. In that case I suggest we amputate both legs. - Both legs? - Uh-oh! Then he can't break them. Remember: Prevention is better than cure. We'll operate in 15 minutes. - What are you doing here? Get out. - Run! Stupid brats! Hey, what's going on? - Where are we going to go? - In here! - We got to get the monster out. - We'll never catch it. We have to save Grandpa. Maybe we can do it. Look, an entire can of freezing liquid. But we can't fire it off. Don't be too sure. Now, Lasse. What's going on? Let me go! It has to work! When does it freeze? It's going to catch us. - Help! - Get the door! Thank you so much. Damn, I'm proud of you. Don't be. Everything's a mess, and you have to help us. - When is the full moon? - He's rambling. - It's the drugs. - When is the next full moon? Tonight. Why? If the Queen possesses someone during the full moon - - she can make thousands of new queens - - who all can make new monsters. - Like the flying ants. - Where is the Queen now? We think she possessed someone who's going to the school party. - We have to be there. - But we're expelled. But I'm not. Go home and get your equipment. I'll get some free2ing liquid from the hospital. Take care now, you hear? ... frightening and inexplicable events of today. Let's begin with the stoy about an employee at the power station - - who meddled with the city power wR' h disastrous resulb. The blackout affected several hundred traffic lights - - resulting in serious accidents. Hundreds of employees were in shock - - after a crane driver tore off the front of their omice building. The crane driver seemed intoxicated, but a blood test disproved this. He was, however, keen on kissing the arresting omicers. Has everyone gone crazy? Babe, hand me the bread knife. Thanks, babe. You look like shit. Hi there, kids. Seen my new shoes? I'm at Oliver's. No, I'm fine. No more cell phone chatter. Let's talk about me and my shoes. - Hand over your phones. - Are you serious? You heard Mom. Hand them over. Text, web, WAP. You never have time to watch TV anymore. - Hey! - Damn cat pees all over the place. Save some bullets for night patrol. Hey, Oliver lives here. - He keeps on dissing you. - Oh? - Where are you going? - To ask him why he doesn't like me. Oliver? - Let me do the talking. - What are you going to say? That he's mean. - It's Luna. - We can hear that. Go and say hi. - What am I going to say? - Try ''hi''. Okay. Coming! How do I look? Wait outside. You don't wanna hear this. You didn't think you were going to talk to Luna, did you? No way. See you, Ollie. Good night, and sleep tight. Wait! Open ! Philip, open ! Let us out. Don't! Please, Philip. Open! - What did he say? - That you're weird. He doesn't want anything to do with you. Everything's going to be alright. Thanks, Philip. - Sofie, you can't. - Don't! She'll just keep on. Why didn't you sense Philip? It happens every time Luna's there. - No, it doesn't! - Yeah. And you talk gibberish. - He's right. - Don't you start. - Maybe Luna spoils your powers. - You like her? - He's crazy about her. - Shut up! - And you want her to like you? - Yes. That's it! You're really good at being scared and sensing danger - - but whenever Luna's near, you try to be someone else. That takes away your powers. If you want to use your strengths, you have to show your weaknesses. You have to believe Luna likes you. - It's just hard. - Who cares? We're trapped anyway. I need those freeze cannons! Time is running out. The garbage man, at this hour? Hey, stop! What do you think you're doing? If only I had my equipment. I saw this horror movie once about zombies who'd taken over the world. People tried to fight the zombies by cutting them up - - but that only created more zombies. Finally they met the chief zombie and shot him right in the head - - and then all the other zombies died. I'm sick of your horror crap. - Maybe that goes for the Queen too. - What if Lasse's right? Bang! Wipe out the Queen, and everyone else goes back to normal. And so what? We're trapped! Why are your paws all wet? Isn't the freezer shut? Yes. Where's she been then? Here, Chicken. Have you got a secret exit? Chicken ... Chicken. Maybe we can get out through this. - Impossible. - Maybe I can. Don't let it end in the sewer. I'm out. - What's up, Lasse? - I can't. Crap! Marcus, you're the brain around here. Get us out of here. - We can use this. - How? Pull! Pull! Are you monster busters or wusses? Do you hear me? Are you having a good time? First we're gonna dance with oranges - - and then it's time for the gummy shoelace kissing competition. - We need to examine your car. - Damn! This is most inconvenient. - Why it's Pops! Hi, Pops. - Tom, what on earth is going on? - Please open the trunk. - And make it snappy, Pops. - What's that? - Liquid nitrogen. - Have you got a permit? - Who cares? Book him. Off we go, boys. - Grandpa! - In the car! Oh no! Ready? - Do you want to be my partner? - Okay. It's the gummy shoelace kissing competition! - How are we gonna catch the Queen? - With these, you moron! We haven't got any freezing liquid. Oliver's grandpa was supposed to get it, and he just got arrested. Us brains always ask a lot of questions. - Us nosey parkers look everywhere. - Bingo. I said you two, not you two. Get it? You two, go ahead. - We have to make him let us in. - Stupid brats. Get in and have fun. Wait! Did I say you could go in? No! Hey, you're expelled! - Look, we just thought ... - Forget it! This is off limits to you. You're not setting foot in my school, get it? You spoiled little brats! Sorry, I didn't hear you. Come a bit closer. I said, you're a spoiled little brat ... Are boxers allowed to fight outside the ring? But who's got the Queen? - Don't you sense it? - I don't sense a thing. - But we can't scare them all. - Look, all the show controls. We haven't got time for that. FLOURESCENT UGHT - There! - Where? - In the middle of the floor. - Who is it? Philip! Oh no, he's dancing with Luna. And the full moon is up. What are we going to do? If anyone sees us, they'll throw us out. What have you got in mind? What? Aren't the balloons for later? What? What are you doing? Where did they go? Get out of my way. - Let go of me! - Luna. - Don't! - Luna! Why are you so mean to me? - If you kiss him, bad things'll happen. - Liar! Hide Luna. Philip's seen us. Now! Again! Trying to scare me? Move, and we'll do to you, what you did to the janitor's dog. Poor mutt sure did get a cold. - You meanie! - We're gonna tell on you. They're still gonna think you killed it. You'll never convince them I killed the dog. I control the entire school. None of those idiots dare disobey me. I'm the king of this shithole! Get it? What the ...? You're busted! Look after Luna. Philip sucks! Philip sucks! - Catch the monster. - What about him? I'm going to deep-freeze the crap out of him, if he as much as moves. - Wanna dance? - Not now. Boring! - Where's Luna? - She bit my hand and took off. Marcus, get the janitor and help Lasse. Sofie, find Luna. I'm going to hunt down the Queen. - Oliver, be careful. - Okay. Think he can do it? You're pretty cool, Lasse. We could be like partners? You and I could rule the school. The King and the Prince. Oliver will never be cool. A real big brother is supposed to protect you. I can do that. I can protect you. How about it? You and me. My big brother is the best big brother in the world. You and I will never be partners. King dork! So it was you! I'll take that, before you do something you'll regret. I sure as hell don't regret that! No. Dad, I don't want to stay here. I can let myself in. Yes, I'll take care. Call you when I get home. Bye. - Luna, wait! - Oh no! - There's a monster after you. - Liar! You're the only one after me. Luna, stop! Luna, there really is a monster. Luna! Where are you? Come on out. Come out, before it's too late. Luna, I'm trying to help you. Didn't you get my CD? I left a CD for you after your recital. - I left a note saying sorry for Ieaving. Yeah right! What CD was it? Han-Na Chang, one of the world's best cellists. Is Han-Na Chang a woman or a man? A woman. You didn't come to ruin my recital? No, we came to ask for your help. What is it? Is there anything there? - There really is a monster? - Yes. - I can't see it. - It's there. - How do you know? - I can sense it. That is, I usually can. But I can't whenever you're around. - Why not? - I'm afraid you don't like me. - Why? - Because I'm a wuss. I think it's really brave to admit you aren't brave. - You do? - Yeah, and I really like you. Watch out! Keep on going, Oliver. This is my house. Thank you. ''Thank you. Kissy-kissy.'' Why haven't we ever kissed? - Christ, don't start that again! - Again? Just kidding. Mom and I have decided we're all going to move in here. - What about Grandpa? - He can stay. - With us? - Yes. - He can help keep an eye on you. - Or vice versa. - Dig in. The broccoli is organic. - It's not fair we have to eat that. I wish they were just a little bit possessed. Cheers, Grandpa. Cheers, boys. Bottoms up. - What is our secret club going to do? - Watch horror movies! I don't think so. - Hi. - Hi. Come in. Hi. Are you sure you want me in your monster busters club? Yes, of course! You have to be in! - Thanks. - Just too bad we have nothing to do. Subtitles: Helle Schou Kristiansen Dansk Video Tekst
