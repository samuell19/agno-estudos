MY FATHER'S STORIES - Don't move, Mom. - I'm not, but I have to make dinner. Excellent work. Really. You don't get that from me. I can't even draw... a square! It's war! What are you talking about? It's war. De Gaulle is on at 8. - It's war, Mom? - Who knows? Finish drawing. "Finish drawing". Drawing Mom won't save the world. André! 11 is no age for politics. We'll see about that. Is the TV plugged in? Our country is now tarnished. Our nation, defied. Our power, diminished. Our power diminished? Our power is not... Our power is not diminished. That's too easy! - You hurt France! - We'll use all means... Give us the means! Give them to us! Prick! What road? - We'll block your road! - ...to eliminate them. It's you we'll eliminate! What's an oath, Emile? An oath is a promise that you must never ever betray. He betrayed his oath. He betrayed his oath. See? He betrayed his oath! He can't be trusted. You can't be trusted! Look at you. - You're abandoning us. - Can he go to bed? - What? - Can he go to bed? - Why? - He's tired. You're tired? Are you? - I'm okay. - Not interested? It's okay. What are you talking about? - Sure he's interested. - I need your help! Trust us, we'll help you. We'll help you. Damn idiot! It's war! It's you we'll eliminate! Traitors! Liars! Damn cowards! Rise, rebel! Come on. Get a paper and pencil and take note. Now? Yes, now. What are you waiting for? Note the following names. Salan. Who? Salan is a friend. Almost a brother. Salan! S-A-L-A-N. Challe. Jouhaud. Listen to me, Emile. You will learn these names by heart. You'll write them on walls everywhere. Okay? Make sure you write them high up. So no one will suspect a child wrote it. I'll supply the chalk. You know who they are? No. Military men who love France, who love their country. Not like de Gaulle. Not like de Gaulle who... sold his country to Russians, Communists and pigs. These men are true rebels. Are you a rebel, Private Choulans? Yes. Keep checking you're not being tailed. - By who? - I'll explain later. All right? For the time being, just remember the names. Then we wait for orders. Go on. Get going, Picasso. Careful, it's hot. Careful. Ted joined the Organization. Here in France. I asked him to help us. He didn't even hesitate. Your plate, honey. - What do you think? - About what? - About Ted's return. - What should I think? Bread, please? Or is it just for you? Come on... you can tell Emile who Ted is. - He can know. - Don't ask me! Ted. My American friend. Oh yeah, sure. Of course. Ted is Dad's American friend. Dad's political stories don't concern me. Yes, you prefer stories about lentils. Can you eat less noisily? That really annoys us. I met Ted on the American base in Châteauroux. Yep. We hit it off right away. Right away! We were always getting in trouble. In fact... Is that how you tidy up? You have to fold them first. Listen to this. Once we were both in a jeep. Ted at the wheel. Me in the passenger seat. That was the day I asked him to be my future son's godfather. He said yes. So we were happy. We slalomed down the runway. They let you on the runway? Did they let us? Are you kidding? Ted was an American captain. In the U.S. Army. And I was a... a war ace. We had total carte blanche. What's this? Do toy cars belong here? That's when it happened. The other car came zooming towards us. It crashed into the side of our car. The shock was brutal, very violent. Ted turned the wheel to avoid it, so we skidded. The other driver's eyes were bulging out! His car kept skidding. The jeep... kept on going for a few minutes. Then it... it came to a stop. I was literally knocked out, but I looked at Ted... He was pale as a ghost. Livid. Panting for breath. He looked at me and with a smile, he said... "I think I lost something!" Know what he lost? His left arm. - His arm? - His left arm! It got sliced right off. Lopped off! It looked like a slab of ham. Not a shout, not a tear, not a scream, nothing. Ah, yes. And Ted... he's my best friend. He had to go back to... Tennessee. But he's coming back. Leave him alone now. School tomorrow. Come. I'll leave him. I'll leave him. Go on... Anyway... I told him everything. About what? About Ted and the Organization. He's a man now. We can share everything. Come on, go to sleep! It's late. This isn't serious. Bedtime. Someone left the bathroom door open! The bathroom room must always be... - Closed. - Closed! Hear the phone this morning? Mom answered: "Sorry, wrong number." It wasn't a wrong number. It was Ted. He gave the go-ahead for our operation. Really? You know what's left to do. Remember the names? Do I write block letters or cursive? Quiet, Dad's sleeping. - I need to tell him something. - No, I told you he's tired! Eat your snack in your room. You two drive me crazy. You plate still smells? Rotten eggs. I'll change it. Did you tell him? About the putsch? Don't I have enough to do? Emile, there's no more putsch. Challe turned himself in. Zeller and... Jouhaud... are on the run. - Did you follow orders? - What orders? We're just having fun. Did you? Tell me! What did he have to do? How insane. Fathers and sons can't share secrets? - Did you? - Lots of times. Good going. Keep it up. Look. There you go. Now write this on walls. What does it mean? It's like CIA for Ted. A secret code. Say it. - O-A-S. - Exactly. It's a secret army. It wants Algeria to stay French. Just like me. - Me too. Just like you. - Good. Our organization works for them now. All right? We mustn't leave traces. This... is really top secret. Okay? Is it real? Yes. We may need it some day. Hands off. Not unless I order you to. All right? All right. You played a jack... - No, it was a queen. - A queen. My turn to play a card now. So what will you do now? There. - You got it. - Right? It's right and it's royal. - Here's my tierce. - You have one, not bad. - Just you wait and see. - All I know is... Are you working at school? Drawing isn't enough. A little. - Your father... - I know. For 45 years now, she goes on about it. You can't stop her from talking. Your father wasn't always on the right side. He made a lot of mistakes. - Let's play. - Just take care. This is good, very well done. Well done! These two are excellent also. - You're really good at drawing. - Thank you! I can feel the crashing metal! And lots of it. Pretty powerful stuff! You even put the smoke. - Look. - Yes, that's just wonderful. I'm happy and proud of you. Funny and what's more, it looks like him. Well done! What's this? Emile? Isn't this a little violent? It's... based on a true story. Who told it to you? Don't trust everything people say. Even your father. Don't think dark stuff. Promise me? Here. It's for you. Hide it. Thanks, Grandma. Already 5 o'clock? Your father is here. - Get dressed quickly. - See you next Thursday. - Have fun? - Yeah. What did you do? Played cards. Did you win? Good. Did you talk about me? Did they say anything about me? You can tell me. Nah. Why are you lying? They mentioned me. Tell me the truth. Answer me. They just said you weren't always on the right side. I didn't understand. They said that? You won't see them again. Hear me? Never again! - But Dad... - No, shut up! Not on the right side? You want to know who they are? Not even my parents! Neighbors I helped during the war. They're pretending! I risked my life for them. Look how they thank me! Who do you believe? Who? Tell me. Perfect strangers? Or your father? Tell me. Don't think it over. Tell me. You. There you go. You'll never see him again! You hear? Never again! Come. - Dad! - It's nothing. Nothing. - Dad and I are back! - You come home and I'm on my way out. - On your way out? - To the concert. What concert? My colleague Mrs. Labarres won two tickets to see the Companions of Song. Since her husband is ill, she invited me. I prepared your meals. You'll see. Just heat it up. For once I'm asked out. I'll come back right after. She'll accompany me. Wish me a nice night? - Goodnight, Mom. - Goodnight. French measures in Algiers. 9 o'clock curfew. This information just came in. Cars with loudspeakers are blaring the news... Dad? Coming to eat? Dad? André! Open up! You left the key in the door. I can't get in. Come and open. André, open up. Open up! Neighbors will find me on the landing! Open up, please. André! What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong? Wanna join her out there? - Leave Emile alone. - So? How were the Companions of Song? - Answer! - Sure, I don't know... You can let her in. I see. Two against one? No one is against you, André. - For your mother's exploits! - Stop this, André. - What? - Emile, go to bed! Know what? Sleep on the doormat, collabo! Wherever you want. Just leave the boy alone, please! - Scared I'll hurt Emile? - Please, he did nothing! You're killing your son! You're killing him! I beg of you! I'll sleep on the doormat! - Let Emile go back to sleep. - All this for a shitty concert. I'm warning you. Let her in and I kill her. Understand? Mom? Go to bed, Emile. - You'll sleep on the mat? - Yes, but my coat is like a blanket. - I can't let you in. - I know. - Night, Mom. - Goodnight. Morning, honey. Morning, my boy. Are you okay? Dad let me in before the neighbors got up. How about you? No asthma attack? - I took my syrup. - Good. - My arm and shoulder hurt. - Here? This shoulder... Your shoulder is fine. I'll put some cream on it, okay? I'm willing to forgive you both. But it must never happen again, all right? You know, Emile, whining won't make a man of you. I will not draw in Math class... Emile... drawing during Math wasn't very clever. Especially if you get caught. But your drawings are very good, technically speaking. But... they're very... very dark. Who gives you these ideas? Just me. Your parents aren't always working? No, it's fine. What do they do? "Mother's profession: assistant accountant in a bus company." "Father's profession: parachutist." Your father is a parachutist, Emile? You draw really well. You're very lucky to have a talent. I'm sure you can do something with it later. Talk to me if you have problems. All right? All right. Sulking? You don't want to know why I got angry? You don't care? You think it was because I don't like Mom seeing dumb Mrs. Labarres? That's not it. So what is it? The Companions of Song. Yes. Because, you know, that vocal ensemble was my creation. The Companions of Song is you? Yes, I did. But back then it was just my friends. There was Fred, Jean, Jean-Guy. We came from all over France. Corrèze... Ardèche... Lyon. There was soprano, bass... I was a tenor. I didn't know you were a tenor. I was a damned good tenor. Damned good. Yeah. Then, you know... there was the war. And also the war of tenors. The war of tenors! Very early on, they realized André Choulans' voice was the best! They said: "You put us to shame. You have to leave. Your voice is too good." Know what I did? You know what? I left. I quit. It destroyed my life. Why leave if you were the best? For the Companions. And... a sense of duty. You understand duty? Here's a story. You know Edith Piaf? Remember? That was me. I introduced Edith to the Companions. I brought her to their first concert. She was in the audience, facing them. She watched them. I was to the side. I didn't want anyone to pay me attention. She was overwhelmed. I don't want your mother clapping for people who never thanked me and who betrayed me. Did you ever tell Mom? The less your mom knows, the better. Rise, rebel. Come on... Get up. Take off your top. Show your muscles. 25, 26... More missions ahead. 27, 28, 29... Straighten up. 30, 31, 32... 9... Good, Private Choulans. Ted wants a rebel with a bull neck. Not an intellectual. One more series of 10. And 11... and 12... and 13... 14... very good. Head high, chin forward... Chest out. It's not dance class. Don't look at me. Look at France. Very good... legs together. Heels pressed together. Like ducks. Fingers close together. Thumbs beside indexes on the seam. When I say "Private Choulans", say "Present." - Private Choulans! - Present! - Louder. - Present! Head high. Stand straight. Proud. Look behind me, not at me. Attention! Emile Choulans. Do you accept to fight for France? Answer with yes or no. Yes. Can you keep a secret come what may? Yes! You will never betray your leaders or compatriots. No. Repeat after me. I will never abandon my Algerian brothers. I will never abandon my Algerian brothers. Mainland France will become a battlefield. Emile Choulans... by the powers vested in me, I name you Private in the Organization. Congratulations, boy. Here. Now follow my instructions by the letter. Extend the antenna. 20 centimeters. Volume... Let's run a test. Test. One, two... Do you read me? - Yes. - No. Speak into the walkie-talkie, okay? Do you read me? Hello? Not "Hello". We say... "Loud and clear", okay? Come on. Do you read me? Loud and clear. Excellent. Now, the stake-out. Can I look too? Sure... look. Check out the 2nd floor. Follow my finger. Now look down. See the door? Salan will be coming out. - Did you hear me? - Salan isn't in Algiers? No, in France. With Ted, your godfather. Yes... have a look. - Here? - Of course. It's amazing! When you see him come out, give him... this. How will I recognize him? I knew you'd ask. Look. Memorize his face. It's Salan. Tell him: "The OAS is watching." Repeat it. The OAS is watching. - Good. - Okay... All we do is wait now. Stake-out. There he is! You're on! - Now? - Hurry, hurry! Do you read me? Loud and clear. What's he doing? No idea. Shit! The cops! Pull back! - But the letter! - Let's split up! Run! Drop the device! Why did you run? It triggers your asthma. - It's a secret. - I'll show you secrets! Here he is. Can we speak man to man? He's tired. He had an asthma attack. Just five minutes. - Careful, he needs rest. - I promise. I promise, I promise... I lost them. Close call. I saw two guys behind you. I thought you were in danger. I created a diversion. - Want to know what happened? - Yes. First guy was a piece of cake. I knocked him out. The second one ran a lot faster. He caught me. I thought: "Shit, another fight!" So I used judo. You know I'm a black belt? - In the army. - Really? Black belt in judo. I swear it's true. I gave him an o-soto-gari, head to the ground. You're not bruised? Did you get hit? - No bruises? - No, but he's in bad shape. It's just to tell you... I want you to know Ted is very proud of you. He saw me? You bet he did. Know what Salan said? He thought you were 15. Salan! Because he... he watches you. He sees everything. They made it thanks to you. I'm proud of you. Come on. Private Choulans... Get some rest. You deserve it. Give us one good reason for you not to be left back again. I want to be an artist. I told you. He's very good. He's very talented. I've never seen it at his age. He's good at drawing, but not the rest. Emile... Why can't you get your grades up? I'm sure you're able to. So what's wrong? Who helps with homework? Your mother works, I know. And... your father. You said he was a parachutist. Is he working now? He's at home these days. But he can't help much. He has important things to do. Very important. Isn't leaving him back better? No. No. He'll help me. He knows lots of people. And lots of stuff. I promise he'll help me. Look at them. Look! He likes pleated pants because they're in style. They'll put gum in their hair if you say it's in style. Ridiculous! Whereas you, son, you're very elegant for your last day. I wore that sweater when I was your age! I did! Nice present, isn't it? And a second present. A bonus. A letter from Ted. What a pretty stamp! "United States of America". Wasn't Ted in France? He went back with President Kennedy. But read it, read it... "Bravo for your school year. Enjoy your vacation. "I promise to come visit soon. "Keep on working for the Orga..." The Organization. "We're counting on you. Ted. Washington, USA. President Kennedy's Oval Office." Washington! He found time to write from Washington! - That's Ted. - He made spelling mistakes. - Where? - Here. Ted is American. His mistakes are normal... for Americans... Here... get going. - When did it come? - This morning. Get going! - Congratulations. - Bye. Have a good day, son! What were you doing? We'll be late! A circus sweater? - Doing a show? - You a Communist? - I'm no Communist! - You're poor! Yeah, poor! - I'm not poor! - Look, you're poor. - My godfather is Kennedy's bodyguard! - Yeah, right, stop lying. - What's this? - Yeah, what is it? A letter from my godfather. The mark? Homemade. Give it back! Give it back! Let go of him! - He can't write English? - Give it back! Your pretty sweater. Too bad! Too bad! Give it back! Is this how you treat my belongings? - Is it? - Stop, it's no big deal. I'll sew it. - Come here. - I'll mend it! - Not the belt! - Out of my way! Let me through! - Come here. - Leave him. Get out from under there! - The neighbors! - I don't care! Come out from there! Come out! Think of the neighbors! - Get out! - Run, run! Stop, stop! Stop I said! Move. - See what you make me do? - Don't touch him! Get out! Stop! - Emile, come out. - Stop it! Stop! You know how this will end. Get out of there! I see you! Look what you make me do. - Get out! - Stop it now! I won't let you! Get out, Emile! André, no! André! Stop it, Emile! Come here! Calm down. Stop! On your knees. Get on your knees! Calm down. Stop! Calm down. Get on your knees. Show me your back. See? You see? Don't. See what you make me do? Don't be angry with him. You know him. Why is he like this? Because he's had a tough life. When he was young. It traumatized him. What? It was after the war. During his military service in Algeria. He saw things no man should see. Like what? I can't say. You're too little. I'm not little anymore. You're my little boy and you always will be. He loves you, you know. He really does. Come on. It's summer vacation. What happens during vacation? I don't know. We forget everything. Fill in all the blanks. Father's profession. Mother's profession. Place of birth. Father's profession: NONE Come in. Stand up. Be seated. Meet Lucas Biglioni, your new classmate. He's from Algeria. Oran, to be precise. You know what's happened there. Give him a warm welcome. Dirty pied-noir! Go back to Algeria. Silence! Everyone, quiet! Take the seat there. Pass up the papers! This year... This year we'll be discussing pulleys. Pulleys... What's that? Sign of the pieds-noirs. Get it back. Nice! Pass it forward! Go get the ball. Foul. You're crazy, dirty pied-noir! Stop, cut it out! Biglioni! Calm down! To the principal's office! The rest of you, calm down! Let's play. Calm down! I never found myself pretty. I was like "No, no..." Your dad answered: "Yes, you are pretty. Pretty as a potted daffodil." A potted daffodil? Where did he come up with that? He had something. My mother always said: "Your husband has something." My parents were less thrilled by his working-class background. You love him? Yes, of course. Even when he shouts? No one's perfect. - Mom? - Yes? Can you sew this onto my sweater? - What is it? - The sign of the pieds-noirs. Honey, we're not pieds-noirs. It's to show support for a new kid from Algeria. We all have to do it. The teacher asked. If the teacher asked, then I'll do it. A faucet fills it in four minutes... A drain empties it in six minutes. To rinse the laundry... - Are you with us? - How so? Wait. You're crazy! I'm on your side. My grandparents' garden. They don't come often. - They gave you the key? - A while ago. I can't see them anymore. It was my uncle first. He got stabbed. Then... we received threats telling us to leave. Three small coffins at the door. One for my dad. One for my mom. One for me. - Who did it? - Arabs! Who else? They smashed our shop window with rocks. And poisoned our dog with lye. Sorry. ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AGAINST DE GAULLE After the assassination attempt, news of which shocked the world, the Minister of the Interior released details. On the road from Nogent to Romilly, a large bomb was planted. It's because the explosives were humid. It stopped them from exploding. Who cares? This is just a diversion. - Understand? - No. A diversion... is a dummy move. Because the real assassination is yet to come. We'll be killing de Gaulle. The Organization will kill him. And we'll need you. - You're in the Organization now. - Really? My godfather works at the CIA. He gave his approval. Your godfather is CIA? Yeah. He works for Kennedy. You're so full of it. Emile? You know the saying? Without effort, talent is a bad habit. We made a deal. - Remember? - Yes, ma'am. You're full of it. There is no Organization. "You don't listen to our call for a French Algeria. "Get de Gaulle involved or you'll be destroyed. A concerned citizen." - Night, Dad. - Goodnight, son. - I have a mission for you. - When? - Now obviously. - You can't do it yourself? Butt out. I'm talking to my son. Listen to me. You'll drop off this letter... in a mailbox. The address is on the envelope. Sorry. It's late, it's dark out. He has school. It's no. What are you up to? Undermining my authority in front of the kid? It's late. - He can't. - Explain... What are you doing? Undermining me? I talk to him. You butt in. You never get tired humiliating me? All day long! You tell me nonstop this is your parents' place. You tell me nonstop I have no work! Now you undermine my authority? - It's late. He's 11... - I don't give a damn! It's not late. What's the time? No, it's not late! It's not late! So stop it! You're not allowed to do this! - I can speak with my son. - It's just late. This is not done! It's not done! Sorry, come here. Come. Do you know who Plevy is? He's a friend of de Gaulle's. This will pressure him. You'll put it in his mailbox. It's on the right when you enter. Hey, you! Honey... I was waiting for you. He's tough on you. - No, it's fine. - Honey... You can tell me, you know. - Where is he? - In the room, asleep. He can't hear. - He asked me to put... - So? - Drop off the letter? - Yes. - You know... no one's forcing you. - No kidding. Wait. It's the chief of the Organization. Sir? What year is your car? Want to go for a ride with us? I made a bet on the year. If you said 1950, you won. I won. All well, honey? Can you leave us now? A shop owner bought 15 bicycles at 215 francs a piece. Shipping and handling cost... Was it really him? The chief of the Organization? I wrote OAS all over the bathroom. And in the cafeteria too. Come on, you see I believe you now. Ask what you want. I'll do anything. That building. The mailbox says "Plevy". Leave the letter. I'll wait here, okay? In case of trouble, we meet at the park. Go on! Go on. Stop! We have one! Stop! Police, stop! Police! What happened that night? - When? - The other night. When you dropped off that bastard's letter? I almost got caught. What? Caught by who? - A lady and a man. - In uniform? - The man had a whistle. - A whistle... And the other boy? Who was he? - What boy? - The other boy! Don't bullshit me! Read out loud! Go on! "OAS Cowards Use Children". "Over four months, Representative Plevy received four death threats. "Anonymous letters, left in his mail box. "The Prosecutor's office opened an investigation. "Police saw two children..." Two children! Why does it say there were two? Maybe to sell papers? Good thinking... because it's a rag! They're obviously trying to get me... No, no that won't work. They didn't recognize you? I don't think so. It was dark out. True enough. See? They'll pass around... a composite portrait of me. The Prosecutor's office... You okay, Dad? Yeah, I'm fine. They're trying to scare me, but... They won't do it. I'm not scared. It's so pretty. Emile, close the window! You obviously don't pay the bills. It's too warm out to stick. Will Dad get up? I don't know. All that politics exhausts him. If de Gaulle died, would he be better? What do I know? Get ready. We leave in five minutes. Come on! Dad? Teachers are on strike today. I'm going to Mom's office. They're all lazy. Lazy as hell. How is the Organization? To kill de Gaulle? What are you talking about? The Organization's plan. The assassination. Want me to take charge? Would you like that? Emile, let's go. Leave your father alone. Coming! It's set, Lucas. January 1, 1962, we'll kill de Gaulle. Just us? Of course not. We have a nine-man commando. I mean... we're small, so we go unnoticed. Check this out now. These are our orders. Learn them by heart. Then throw it away. Immediately. Immediately? So... "Meet December 31st, restaurant Le Cabaret. "Prepare a valise, three days of dark clothing. "Take all your parents' hidden cash. "Steal the checkbook." Go on, keep reading! "Steal their IDs. "Destroy report cards and official documents. "Take a knife." I can't. All right. Too bad. The chief will be disappointed. I'll do it alone. I can't do all this. You don't realize. I do realize. Even Brigitte will be disappointed. The chief's daughter? - She doesn't know I exist. - Are you kidding? - What? - I shouldn't tell you, but I will. Brigitte... she saw you from the car. And... she likes you! I'll do it. I'm in. I believe you. - Watch out. No changing your mind. - Got it. - We want reliable guys. - It's fine. Keep on reading. Take a knife. Take a white shirt. - What if your dad come home? - He's at the doctor's. Relax. Six more and we're done. Do l look good for the assassination? - Classy. Can I have the same? - Of course. There's more. There's this too. Give it to me. It's not loaded. A Mauser HSC. You know it? Got bullets? Yeah. Caliber 7.65. You can put in eight. - With 9mm, you can put only seven. - How do you know this? - My uncle had the same. - The one who got killed? - This is for Operation Sparrowhawk? - Yes. And by the way... Brigitte... would like it if Lucas... pulled the trigger. I was sure of it. It will be an honor. - Happy holidays. - You too. My parents... I won't see them anymore? No. But they'll be proud. See you on the 31st, Frenchie. - Wine glass on the right? - Yes, honey. Careful with my nice glasses. The silver. This is my favorite moment. Mom? If you ask someone to... to do weird stuff... should he? What weird stuff? A mission. - Dad asked you something again? - No, it's not him. I mean... if you ask someone to do a mission that's dangerous and weird, should he? It depends. You can't do just anything. Even if asked? Yeah, you can't obey if it's bad. If you gave an order, and you want to call it off, but it's too late. What are you talking about? I don't get it. I mean... if you hurt someone without meaning to... is that bad? Of course it is. You're exhausting me. Put the fish knives. Even de Gaulle, on New Year's Eve, doesn't talk politics. It's a holiday! These holidays are bullshit. People get suckered in. It puts them to sleep. He can't grab it. I like him. Wifey, do you remember The good old times? It was the first time We fell in love for good Now I have to say, we're just two old schnooks But what makes it better is that we have our ways God, it's true I called you honey Don't be upset but I had no recollection We talk about memories but we forget so much I'm sorry, honey Let's not mention it again Wifey, if I'm telling you this It's just to say I love you To blurt it out like that Was very hard for me In the end I'm happy I see you understand And I can tell you, wifey I've only loved you 10, 9, 8... Happy New Year! Who can that be? What's that racket? - Who is it? - I came to see Emile. What do you want with him? We were meeting at Le Cabaret. We want no trouble! What's this about? Tell me. - I don't know. - What now? Tell him to leave immediately. What's going on? Who is it? I'll go. We got discovered. - Cops all over. Run! - What do you mean? The Organization is done. Beat it! - Where do I go? - Just leave! Can I know what happened? He's... he's my friend. He gave me this back. What on earth are you talking about? Answer me. - Why did he come so late? - He left his home. - And his family. - What do you mean "left his family"? - Why did he have your necklace? - It broke. And his dad's a jeweler. He tried to repair it... but he couldn't. Left? Where is he going? All he said was... he prepared his escape for months. His escape? You scared me. He's running away! He's running away! That's it! Don't talk to him ever again. Or we'll have trouble. Understand? It's nothing at all. Don't get worked up. Just write a letter to the principal so that boy won't speak to our son. Or else, trouble! I'm going to sleep. The year started well. Thanks. Mom... Dirty little liar. What did you do now? - Mom... - Don't touch me... Leave me alone. Lucas Biglioni won't be back. He did something stupid. He ran away, stole his parents' money, all their papers, and slashed their tires. In France we have police, justice, laws. Biglioni was found two days later, sleeping in a box on the road to Vienne. He's being sent to reform school. Biglioni kept a secret diary. This diary mentions accomplices. This is why Detective Vaujour is here. He glimpsed the accomplice during a failed arrest where he is sure to have seen Biglioni. Besson, Raoul. Cadario, Henri. Choulans, Emile. It's fine. You! Turn around. Come closer. You can go. Delacourt, Paul. Duclaus, Gustave. I'm stronger than Lucas. Much stronger than the police. This time, I was stronger than you, Ted. Private Choulans. Officer of the OAS. Hello, Ted. I'll kill de Gaulle for you. And for Dad. The police are looking for an accomplice. They have no proof, but we know it was Emile. Without proof how do you know? Classmates say they were often together. There's more. Lucas' diary refers to a one-armed American. Member of the CIA. Mrs. Latu, their Art teacher, says Emile drew the same figure last year. They were also both spotted writing OAS on the school walls. What do we do? Do you find it normal? Manipulating a friend into stealing his parents' money? Of course not. Having a plan to kill de Gaulle? Mr. Choulans, do your son's mad ravings seem normal to you? As his parents, do you realize how serious this is? - Yes. - Biglioni is now in reform school. He's rather lucky. So take the necessary measures. Your son is prone to delirium and needs a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist? André... a psychiatrist. Madam... when a child's actions take place in an imaginary world, with no connection to reality, when he leads others, into his fantasy world, it may be time to consult a specialist. For his own good. You're right. Our son is mad. Do you realize what he's done? He forced one of his friends... to do things... We'll find him a psychiatrist. He'll undergo treatment. We'll treat you, honey. If not, we'll expel him. Am I clear? So? How's the madman? - We're going to have him treated! - André, stop. That's enough. - It's not enough. - Yes. We're called into the principal's office to hear that our son is... - No need to keep bringing it up! - What did you tell the police? Did you mention me? - You'll go to the psychiatrist. - I'm not going. Yes, you bet you are. Explain your plan to kill de Gaulle. Hello, I'm Emile Choulans, I wanted to kill de Gaulle. Stop screaming for the neighbors to hear! No, I want all the neighbors to know! - My son is a nutcase! - Enough. Stop now. - I was killing de Gaulle for you! - For me? Fuck Algeria, fuck the OAS! I don't give a fuck! What did you say? - What did you say? - Calm down. You don't give a fuck? - André, keep calm. - My poor boy, it's not for me. - It's for France, your country! - I did it for you! I wanted to help you! You betrayed me! Come now, Emile, no one betrayed you! Don't pour oil on the fire! - Keep calm! - And watch your tone! Take it down, okay? - See the psychiatrist! - Stop with that! Stop repeating! - I'm talking to my son! - Why tell the principal that? I'd never have done that! What are you talking about? Don't ever use this tone on me! It's not my fault! You have a little problem! That's all! Lower your eyes! Lower them! You're the damn maniac! You'll see! André, stop! André, please! - I'm warning you! - Wait, honey. It's loaded! Emile, stop. Put the gun down. I'll put the belt down. I won't see a psychiatrist! I won't go, you hear? - All right. - I'm not crazy. I'll show the psychiatrist the letters you gave me. From Ted, and de Gaulle! Your blueprints for the assassination! I'll show him everything! You're the crazy one. You're the crazy one. Put the gun down. Drop it. It'll be fine. It's over. 25 years later - When do we see the doctor? - In 20 minutes. See? - What? - The carp there. See it? - No, there's nothing. - Look, there. There's one there. - I don't see. - Come on. Let's get going. I don't want to be late. Your husband is asleep. We gave him his pills. Dr. Bosc is a psychiatrist. She's tending to him. I see he called you crazy and didn't recognize you. When was that? - When was it? - Emile. May 19th. Nothing unusual before then? Not even weeks before? Months? - Years? - No. Nothing. Nothing but the cold and fever. Never in your life did you think he had behavioral issues? Emile, tell them. Tell them he wasn't mad. He wasn't mad. He was normal. - Did he see a doctor before? - Of course. He had always seen our family doctor. Right? You never noticed behavioral problems? No. My father was always crazy. Violent. Delirious. That's the only way I remember him. How can you say that? It's not true. Why do you say that? It's not true. Why is he saying that? I don't know why. Our family is... fine. A very fine family. When your father finds out what you said... Dad? It's me. Dad. Emile. I'm here, Dad. What? - Want to tell me something? - I said don't worry. I'm playacting. It's all under control. I know. You mustn't be afraid. No, because as long as we stick together, they can't do anything to us. I know. With you I'm not afraid. It wasn't always easy. But you know... Ted told me: "If you see Emile, "ask his forgiveness. "But we did what we had to." That doctor is very good. - Were you that unhappy as a child? - Mom... - You prefer the hotel? - Yes, I leave early. - Is your family well? - Yes. Little Clément? He must have grown. He sure has. Clément... What a pretty name. I'd like to see him. We'll come soon. You always say that. "We'll come soon" and you never come. I have lots of work. - Still your drawings? - Yep. - It's my job. - It sounds funny... As long as you live off it, I'm happy. You can bring the boy now. All right, Mom. - Really? You will? - I promise. All right. - You know the fish. - What fish? In that pond... the carp. I saw it. I even saw two of them. Why did you say you saw nothing? I don't know. It was easier, I think.
