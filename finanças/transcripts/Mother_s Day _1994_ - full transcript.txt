MOTHER'S DAY Asshole! Just wait! Papa, why are you sleeping on the loo? Are you going to bed already? It's morning: Flush and go to bed. You should have left me in the old-age home. You've never been in one. But I was a P.O.W. Ssh, don't wake the others! Go away, I have to pee. So much expensive junk... Gerry, you beast... Mr. Gratzl, you can't do that! Good morning, Mr. Neugebauer. Good morning, Mrs. Miller. Oh, shit! Good morning, Mr. Neugebauer. I'll call the police! Of course. Good morning, Mr. Schwalbach. Stop that, Mischa.

The flowermakers are raking it in this weekend. And they just wilt. I don't need any... You're not getting any. Mother's Day is a waste of time. Watch your tongue. And finish breakfast. OK. Don't talk back! A Toyota 16V economy engine, all electric. Cheap! 249.600 - a real bargain. We decided on new furniture. And my Lone Ranger City Bike. I wouldn't even haven gotten you that expensive computer. First the home and then new wheels! You said no new furniture until Grandpa's in a home. We'll never put Grandpa in a home. Scoundrels. We'll see, who draws first. And now for the big bang. Let's spend a winter holiday in Kenya. Sure, and summer in Greenland! Others are doing it! Why are so many thin or pudgy why are so many Frankensteins why are there some that look so lovely and why am [ not as cute as wise why are so many people scoundrels why do so many cheat and lie why are some others really off well why am I not riding on top The Mamas and the Papas are at fault... Seek the Darkie! But I did put a coin in. Darn! 3478 children live on this block. I'll take it. Post-office, Perlinger speaking. Morning! Broke the record, Champ? Nope. Skidded on the playground. Rotten luck. Who's there? Sure you can donate money... A pound of minced meat, thinly sliced. In abun? Yes, but no bones. We're out of hones. I'll come back tomorrow. Perlinger speaking... I want to donate my bank books. ... I can't hear you, you're always talking. Morning! How are we? Not so good. Why? The scales are broken. Hi, honey-bun. Piss off! Come on... And the return address? Bye! If you pass a market, don't forget my Bounty. Might not fit on my scooter. Let's say 6 pounds. Much too big for 6 pounds. Whose truck is on my scooter? Mine. Why? Would you remove it? Now? It's urgent because of the doner kidney. Someone's waiting, I guess. Edwin, check the balance on the parish bank book. I'm already pushed for time. We have to go! OK. What's wrong? I want to stay home. I have flue, tonsillitis and rheumatism. We were anchored in Madagascar with the black plague on board the buckets full of rotten water and daily a body over board Ahoi, comrades, ahoi, ahoi... Watch out, the bus! Hi, what are you doing at seven? Don't wait, Gerry. Every moment with you counts, Sugar. The old lady is off to a 2-week workshop. I'll miss you, Sweets. There's nothing to oogle at, children. I want to stay with you. You better behave. Don't embarrass me like with the boy-scouts. A kidney! I need a new one. Is it a left one? Never mind. Just wear it upside down. Anything wrong? Are you crazy? Never let on you saw something. Some things we don't hear, see, or talk about. Active foam, high pressure cleaning, rinse, glossy polish, the works. And you? Just a wash.

I want a change. To blond? A bit stickey. Thank the Lord, and Miss Evelyn Schébinger, who brought these rhythms from Kenya. Let us hope for Mary's plea and the Lord's forgiveness. It alf isn't true slowly I can see trough it alf isn't true When I hear someone hold a speech about how he's going to turn the world around then I know for sure... How's it look? Some shiner! Can I ride your bike? It'll rust with your sweaty fingers. Did you bring the discs? Sure. It better be hard core, or I'll get you tomorrow. Not tomorrow, Mother's Day. F... Mother's Day. It alf isn't true slowly I can see trough it alf isn't true ...some have not been blessed. Give them the power to open up for the conception and the life-giving seed. Hear our prayers. Come on!

Looks like her. Get in the mood, everybody, says Papa and after a few kicks in the ribs, Sonny says his poem The men do the cooking, of course so watch out, Momma!

Sonny packs his toys and threatens to move out Poppa, dead drunk, wants sex in the afternoon so watch out, Momma! It was froggy something... A frog? No, fog. Not fog, {... froggy. I was there. Is there coffee? It's cold. Let's celebrate inside. Can't set this up inside. That's settled. I'll catch something in this draft. Might as well have left me in the home. You've never been in a home. But P.O.W. - French in the First, Russian in the Second. Scoundrels, all of them. Put up my chair. The wind'll blow me over. There is no wind, you pest. My knees! You're nerve-wrecking. Thanks, you're so kind. But I can't put it up alone. A little to the side. Sideways... Got it! Leave it. There. No, Grandpa, the cover stays. The cover's still on. It stays on. You always slop on everything. What's that? The Mother's Day present. Whose birthday is it? Nobody's! He'll be pleased. Just wait. Robbery. I want to make a report. Steals papers each Sunday and you don't care. Hello? What's up, Karl? Schwalbach. What's he want? The usual, paper robbery. Who's that? Won't say. We'll fix that. Hear that ugly noise? Yes. Lieutenant Berecz. He's not as nice as we. But we'll get him, if you won't talk with us. Help me. Can't get up. The cover's too slippery. I'll get it. No, Mischa's not home. { know he's here. Then why do you ask, you impudent so and so... Who's talking? The police. We've arrested some Mischa Neugebauer. Of course, sir. Thanks. Immediately. I told him anyway. Gerry, you beast!

Such aromal The egg-nog is a little sweet. Shouldn't drink it, botulism, you know. Yes. Bottled it's more delicious. Especially when its fresh. Good Day. Let's go, dear. Let's get it over with.

Not O.K. - this is a day of joy for Mom and us all. We'll be right back. Take your head away. It's not mine. Do we have guests? Young man... Don't have time. Who is it? Who cares. Schwalbach's? Willi, come to Gramps. Grandpa'll feed you. Sit down. You still have some goodies here. Eat those first. Child pornography, disturbance of the peace and she's the wanted thief. Arrest them! Right away, Mr. Schwalbach. Gerry, a lady for you! Forgot your toy, sweetie. I'll bring it by. No? Then I'll take your wife's calls. Kiss - but not there! Hurry, three bouquets. All gone. Let me have it. A hundred. That's fine. The apple tree must carry tons of apples. But in the fall it can say, that's enough. And the load is taken off. It may rest for a half a year. Mothers... ...are not as well off as apple trees. Hi. Have you all gone crazy? Where's Dad? Why are you here? Why not? Because of the surprise. Edwin's getting Trude. I'm already here, Dad. I didn't recognize you with your new fur hat. Are you all crazy? What's that? Your surprise. A hole in my tablecloth? Thanks. Dad'll be upset that you've seen it. He won't. You shut up, Mischa. Who cares. Great. Nothing's ready. Have you been picking your noses? Where's Trudl gone to? Missed her. Bet she's walking. Got the car washed and polished for nothing. That's her! Line up. Hurry, Pop. Dearest Trude. Mother, wife, daughter-in-law. As each year, we wish... ...to thank you for everything, be it household or family. We'd never be washed or combed... Louder! I hear it! We'd never be washed or combed... the socks... we'd have dirty socks and shirts... we'd eat fish with honey... ...and cauliflower with cinnamon... if you wouldn't... ...take care... ...that everything's O.K. Mom, if we are. Sometimes a burden, Mom. What would you do without kids. Be glad you have us. Wonderful, thank you. The real present is something we've all been wanting. Move. Sensational! What a great table! Neat, huh? And so comfortable. Are you crazy spending so much money? Nothing's too dear for you. We robbed our bank books. Sure did. Look, Ma. From me. You anyway have no money. Wow! Try it on the cutlets. How does it turn on? No way. It's Mom's day. Today we cook. Can I borrow it? Edwin, that's my knife. The cutlets are so tough. It's Mother's Day! Don't crush the flowers. Buckle up for the highway. Scandal! Hilde, get out. The ride's off. Don't talk back. I'm s0 hungry. I'll take a sausage. Stop it, Pop. Are you OK? I'm all right. Come upstairs for a band-aid, and bring a paper. We're BBQ-ing. It'll be fun. What's up? Nothing. Evelyn's coming. Not on Mother's Day! I don't need her either. Quit it! This is my day. It's our day, too! We don't have enough cutlets. Shame on you! You can have my cutlet. Too tough for me teeth. Are you crazy? Grandpa, eat your cutlet or else. For Mom! Hit What an original hair-do. Nice, huh? Join us, we anyway have too much food. Look, whom I have here for you. Well, who's this? This is my father-in-law. Evelyn Schdbinger. We met already. At the post-office. But we were younger then. Congratulations! Thank you. How sweet of you. Here. Do you like my present? Gorgeous! Sit down. Martini? Sure! Shall I fix another one? We have already two. Cheers! Some Mother's Day. Mama, don't cry about your son. Mama, fate will bring you together again. He'll never forget what you meant to him that there's only one on earth with a love like your's Mama, even if life means sorrow and pain he'll think of you because you pray for him Dreams of youth pass by... I'll get you a plate. Ml help. You have no business here. But, Edwin... No intimacies. In fact, get out of here. Stop it. Something's whistling. Give back my hearing-aid or I'll tell. Tell what? Everything. What's the matter? Nothing. Cheers! Attention, feed Willil What are you doing? Leave him be. He's sleeping. I say it here and now, I didn't sit on Willi. Papa, Grandpa killed Willi. Yes, he's gone. Is Willi asleep? Grandpa, you pig! Mischa, we don't call people pigs. Not even Grandpa. Come to Mama, Sweetie. Willi was already over the hill, and now he's in guinea-pig heaven. No! Sure. He's watching over you now. Mummy'll get you a new one. Or do you want a hamster? No, a Dobermann. Over my dead body. What's with Willi now? Don't play dumb, Pop. Might as well have left me in the home. Could someone kindly take Willi off the table? I'm afraid of the toxins. I'll take him because I'm leaving. I'll take him away. Do we have guests? They won't notice anything. Come, Evelyn, I'll show you something. This is where we'll put the synthetic drapes. No ironing, you know. Listen, I have to leave. Please don't. Who knows what else they're up to. And the sun is coming out again. 0.K, for you, but not for long. I'm sick of the bad weather. Edwin told me it was lousy on the parish weekend, too. What? Just talking about the parish weekend. I would have come, but my headaches... You didn't miss much. The evenings are always fun, though. Can't you talk about anything else? Why? Who cares about the parish weekend! Or do you want to torture me? Edwin... Don't "Edwin" me in front of my family! What's the matter? Who cares. Pull yourself together. Do what you want. Stone me. 0K, it happened. [ was drunk. That can happen to anyone. So you don't even care? Don't make a mountain out of a molehill. A mountain? You're making a fool of me. She seduced me! Great. Dad has a thing with her. What a Mother's Day. Killed! Imagine, killed! I want to make a report. Are you serious? What now? Now he says there's been a killing. Murder? At Neugebauer's? Believe me, it was nothing. How can you do that to me? To you? To me! It was nothing. We drank a little and then things got slippery. Where did I slip? Pull yourselves together in front of the child. A child? Come on, Mischa is no baby. Listen, you. I know my son. Me, too... You know what she did with me? I did what? That's the thanks I get for sticking up for you. You're sick. Seducing minors. That's criminal. I'm leaving. You stay. Trude, call the police. It's not funny, Grandpa. Look, Dad, Mom's in the paper. Isn't that Trude? Shoplifting. I don't believe it. Freeze! Hang up! I'll spell the name. Hang up. No, Sir. We'll see this through. Thanks for your call. I'm getting real hungry. That isn't me. Totally different hair-do. Sure it's you. Don't lie. All that expensive stuff in the closet. I don't get it. Nothing ever happened before. Is that your hobby or something? You have your model planes, don't you? But I don't shoot anybody. Wow! Mom shot somebody. I'm ashamed of you. A shop-lifter. Don't I take good care of you? She steals! Nobody has to go hungry here. I do! It's all your fault. Now listen, Edwin. You listen! This doesn't involve you.. I didn't involve myself, you did. I'm leaving. Get out, and fast. Dad, she'll tell the police. Who's that now? I think the doorbell rang. Don't you think you should reconsider your life? You won't talk, Evelyn. They'll catch you anyway. Let's not haggle. How much? Great. Bribery! Shut up. How much? Admit it, you want my fur coat. I'd take it, too. All |I want is to leave. You're all crazy. Let me go! You shut up. Mischa, get the bank books from the bedroom. Evelyn, please! Dad, there are no bank books. What? Wait. I have it. Are you out of your mind? Where's the other one? I still have to think about that one. You don't need the money anyway. I donated it to the animals. They're so in need. Miss Evelyn was kind enough to help me with the money transfer. My city bike... You ruined our happy home. What did you do with our money? You're sick. Help! Shut up! You should all be put away in a mental home! Oops... Oh my God! I say it here and now: it wasn't me. Oooh, bad! If anyone sees that... What's going on up there, Mrs. Schmidt? Do something, Edwin. I can't stand it. Do what? Hold her. It's better like this. Please don't. It wasn't me. I love you, Edwin. Open up. Police. Open up, or we'll have to break in the door. Who cares. I have to pee. Oh, no you don't. These people claim to be anonymous witnesses. Supposedly you tortured and killed this animal and threw if off the balcony. Yes. I rather assume the unlucky animal lost its balance and fell to its death. Yes. Just a minute. It wasn't like that. Don't mingle in official business. And how about the newspaper? Go home and keep yourselves available. My condolences, Mr. Neugebauer. Likewise. Thank you. It cost you a round at the next games. You're both a little pale. Don't overdo the festivities. Inspector! Where should we put the body 50 no one finds it? Are you out of your mind? Throw it on the BBQ. A WARM NIGHT IN JUNE Put on some more, Fritzi. Since this morning I am sure. I don't know where I was yesterday but I'm sure to go there again I have to go there every night Day by day before the town awakens {leave my trace at the edge of night No way back, the hunter wins my place is with the wild kids The moon has risen, the golden stars are strung. Everything's in tune, everybody sings... What a family, the Neugebauers. Only since they put Grandpa in a home. It's always the same. If just takes one to spoil the harmony. Just think of Evelyn... That's where the police really failed. I wonder where she is? Probably in Kenya, with her bimbos. She can afford it with our bank book. Tonight or never... Trude, sweetie pie, I've had enough. I'm tired. Was it good? A little sweet. That's because it was frozen. Mischa, give the bones to Willi. On behalf of everyone, thanks for the generous donation. Delicious. You're welcome. Cheers, Sweetie. Aren't you eating? Thanks, but we've been working all day. Makes one lose the appetite. Hove the world and it loves me 1l get you and I know just how Good evening. Am I intruding? Lovely. Proof, once again, that the community doesn't need to be big, but united in belief and understanding. Cheers! ON A DISTANT ISLAND At will be well, we'll start again and leave this place behind I can rest and close my eyes and see it in my mind It is summer the wind fills the sails and leads to the island full of happy people... Thanks. Young Man! The beer is warm. Might as well have left me in the home. But Grandpa's never been in a home. But I've been a P.0.W. - With the French in the First and the Russians in the Second. Dally, dally. Behind the yellow line, train leaves.
