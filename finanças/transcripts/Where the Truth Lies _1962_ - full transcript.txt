Sorcery Good morning, Chauvin. I don't think you can help. Why? This is my 3rd animal that got sick this year. Someone out there is angry with me. There are many sorcerers in this country... You think someone cast a spell on you? You don't believe it? I don't know. Your cow has meningitis. If she was sick in the head, she would be cured. I put some skin between the horns. We'll try something else. Is it you who took care of the animals of Morin's son? Yes. I did what I could. They're all dead. They bear a grudge against Morin's son too. Okay... I'll come back tomorrow. See you then. Hello, my dog. Hello. Good dog. Come on, tell me about your day. It was a day... a day as usual. You know what time it is? If this keeps up... Well, if this keeps up, in 6 months we shall no longer have any debts. The house, the rest... I hate debt, you know that. My dad was already like that. If this keeps up, in 6 months we shall be dead. You from exhaustion and me... What about your headaches? Did you hurt again, today? No, it's okay. It's the North. It will be sunny tomorrow. I was at Chauvin's this afternoon. He is convinced that someone is making his animals die. It reminds me of... I read that in the Sarthe, and this is not New Guinea, there are as many wizards as doctors. It's unbelievable! - It's good to be home! - Yes. I'm really exhausted. That's pretty. It's my aunt Anna from Mulhouse who gave it to me. You like it? - Good evening. - Good night. Oh! I think I'll be asleep in a jiffy... You don't want me to buy you a tv set? What is it now? Oh dear! It's a horse or a cow, as usual. An American car. There must be a Pekinese in it. Doctor Rauchelle? - Veterinary Doctor, yes. - You must go to Noirmoutier immediately. The Gois Passage won't be clear before tomorrow morning. - Can't you take a boat? - With the storm? Okay, then go ahead tomorrow at the first hour. Mrs. Heller's, Villa Le Tam-Tam. Yes, that's very important. - What's it about? A dog? - No. A cheetah. You know what it is, when one is fond of an animal. I gave her to Mrs Heller. I didn't call you, you might have thought it was a joke. You will go, won't you? - I never took care of a wild animal before. - They're beasts like the others. - Okay. I'll go. Thank you. - Are you sometimes going to Nantes for your work? - Every Saturday. I'm there for a while. Come and give me some news. Duchesse Anne Hotel. Ask for Dr. Vial. I'll pay you. Here's my card. Here. - Very well. - Thank you. See you Saturday. - You heard him? - He looked like a night bird. - A cheetah? - Yes. Cheetah... "Carnivorous mammal, family of Felidae. "The speckled variety "is known from the Cape to the Sahara." That's all I know about them. - Don't you write the name of the client? - Heller. I'll remember it. - Me too. Le Gois Passage (4km long) Friday 10th September Low tide from 8:46 AM to 22:07 PM I phoned to Grignon at the Vincennes Zoo this morning. He said to me: "A cheetah is just a cat, "except that you multiply the doses by 4." It bothers me that you agreed to take care of this animal. An old teacher told us at Alfortville (French National Veterinary school): "If a tamer brings you a tiger to heal, be wary of the tamer." Is it possible to tame a cheetah? Well, there are some cheetahs at the foot of the ladies on the tapestries. It's been 3 months since I went to the island. I'll go to the market during your visit. It would be better to avoid having an accident here. You know what a good swimmer I am. It is the only place in the world where a car could be wrecked. Miss, please. You know a Mrs. Heller at Villa Le Tam Tam? - Heller? No. - She has a cheetah. - A what? Is there a horse butcher shop here? Yes, there is one in the market hall. - You would make a very good detective. - Thank you. - Do you know a Mrs. Heller? - It's the lady who owns a cheetah? I think so. - You're the vet from Beauvoir? - Yes. I saw you on the mainland. The animal is sick. She's eating good though. - Where is this lady's villa? - On the way to the lighthouse. - Good. Thank you. - You're welcome. - How much is that one? - 3000. I have the adress. I'll meet you at the cafe. - Be careful. - Don't take a small one. PROPERTY FOR SALE Anyone there? - Mrs. Heller? - Yes. - I'm the vet. Dr. Vial asked me to... Don't talk about him. Pretend it's me who called you. Come. Come in. Wait here. Don't push. It's better. What do you want? - Dr. Rauchelle, veterinarian. - Who called you? I did. I want him to take care of Nyété. Nyété is not sick. If she was, I would look after her myself. It's about a cheetah, right? It's not Ronga who called you. It's Dr. Vial. He probably went to your house last night. That's right. It's very hard to tell me tales. Good. Since you are here, courageously... Come. It will give you an anecdote to tell at the cafe while playing cards. Come. Dr. Vial likes Nyété very much. In fact, he likes everyone in the house. I guess you rarely take care of wild beasts. Yes, indeed. Nyété is not mean normally. But she has her moods. You're not lucky. She's in a bad mood today. I'll go first, I think. Here's the young lady. Don't be afraid, I'm here. If you still want to examine her, I can try to introduce you. Nyété, my girl, here is a gentleman who has the pretension to... Please. May I? Nyété, is that it? Hello, Nyété. Nyété... Yes. Good girl. Good girl, yes. You are beautiful. Let me do my job. So we're sick? Where are you hurting, Nyété? Sweet girl. But you worked in a circus! Whore! Sweet girl. You were very nice. - What does she have? - Nothing. I already told you. There's something but it's not serious. The heart and the lungs are in good condition, but there's something wrong with the liver. - You give her too much meat. - What does a wild beast eat? Some salad? It wouldn't be a problem if this beast lived in the forest. But since she must spend all day in bed, give her just enough meat to give flavor to the vegetables. - I'll give you a medicine. - She won't like it. Sorry. Let's go downstairs. Would you like something to drink? No, thanks. Ronga, make us some coffee. What are you waiting for? Go away. Nyété is like me: we're homesick. - Will you be here for a while? - I hope not. It's time to sell this damn house and to get my mind off things. On the doorstep, I already knew she was sick. Healthy beasts smell of hay and soil. Do you like animals? I don't like them suffering. That seems unfair to me. Don't you like them? It's like anything else: sometimes yes, sometimes... Sugar? No, no sugar. Thank you. What do you do in this country? People are shabby here, don't you think? No. I find that everywhere... Have you traveled a lot? I only know Venice. You are married? Of course. Yes. Children? No. I'm wasting your time. How much do I owe you? - I will send you my bill. - That is a very bad habit. These are your works? It's beautiful. You know anything about painting? No, unfortunately. That explains it. On the other hand, if you don't mind, I don't like this one as much. Me too. Excuse me. I will send you more tablets, I'm going tomorrow to Nantes... You will probably see Dr. Vial? Duchesse Anne Hotel, room 13? And it's him who will settle your bill, I guess? Don't make this face. It's very easy to guess. If one day you come back here, come in and say hello. To cure animals, I know some tricks that they don't teach you at Alfort. If it amuses you, I will tell them to you. I have several strings to my bow. You'll see. Thank you for coming. - What will you have? - I don't drink. Except water. And still, no mineral water. These are dead waters. So, tell me about Nyété. Nothing serious. Her food is too rich. I have already said it to Myriam. It's Mrs. Heller. But she does not listen. Not yet. Maybe you'll have better luck. It's a classic. You like an animal, and then... Can we know what Myriam likes? And you are here for? For a book and a conference on Africa. More precisely, on the concerns of... It's in Africa that you met Mrs. Heller? She's on holiday in Noirmoutier and her husband must be... Her husband died in Yaoundé last spring. The weather there must be terrible. - The weather had nothing to do with his death. Really? I see... She came back to France... She didn't come back. She was born in Africa. She will return there when she has sold her horrible house. What about Nyété, is it a gift from you? No, not a gift. You're curious, aren't you? You're interested in Myriam? You have your chance. For her, love is as simple as drinking or eating. And she has good appetite. She has good appetite and hates to wait. I'm probably the only one who wasn't to her taste. How strange. However, I... I'll make her yield. She may defend herself and know a lot of things but I know as much as she does. Mrs. Heller is very talented. I have seen portraits by her, paintings, some kind of quarry. This is where her husband died. I don't want to speak about her paintings, that I find bad... - What is it? - You were expecting somebody? Someone on the phone is asking for a lady that should be here. I did not quite understand the name. Hiller or Neller... You see, there's nobody. At least, it seems so. I'm sorry. The coincidence is amusing. It is a convenient word, isn't it? Do you believe in coincidences? It's a real tomb. It's the old cistern. The well is running dry, so I thought... Don't think about it. It's too close to the pit. - You think so? - I'm sure. In your place, I would clog that. You see that the trapdoor is collapsing. Believe me, it's dangerous. I'll talk about it with my husband. "If one day you come back here, come in and say hello." Hello, Ronga. I'm back to see Nyété. - Is it Ronga? - Nyété is fine. - She's in the room? - Don't go there, Doctor. How long have you been here? Who is Dr. Vial? A friend of Mrs. Heller? - No, you should not go. - Don't talk nonsense. Marijuana. It's stupid. Why? It hurts. Where? Do you want to see a doctor? You cannot treat me? Nyété, come on. Come with me, my dear. You are beautiful. - I was beginning to worry. - What do you want to happen to me? There were phone calls. Phew! I'm better. - I beg your pardon. - For what? For being late. I'm used to it. You're amazing, you know? Kiss me. You're pretty, you know? François... But what's wrong with you? I had a terrible day... I drove 151 km. You can check. Epois, Saint-Jean-de-Monts, Les Trois-Moulins, Fromentine... And the cheetah, you saw her again? - The cheetah? - No, since she was not really sick. Chauvin telephoned. You went there? Yes. He made me lose a lot of time. - He told me about his cow. - You know. I told you. It's the old man who believes that a spell was cast on him. He may have offered you one or two glasses of marc. - Why do you say that? - You look euphoric. Yes, indeed, he offered a glass to me. - You never drink. - It was an exception. You know, Catherine, I think you have a very dull life with me. - What? - Yes. I may not look it, but I think about it. I'm not complaining. The world is vast, you know. And beautiful. It is full of things... Well, other things. - Don't you like things here? - I do. It's for you that I say that. You are young, smart, beautiful... You could have... Honey, what's up with you? I just want you to be happy. Yes? I waited for your husband all day! It's not necessary for him to come! My cow has died! How is it at your home? What do you care? I'd like to see you there too. Like I was there. It is a transformed farm with a grid that leads to the garden. Is it big, the garden? What do you care, since you'll never go there? That's the point. The garden is small, with a well in the middle. A well? Surely an old well. What kind of shrub is this? A mango tree. It refuses to grow mangoes. It must be bored, too. And it's because you are bored that I am here? Yes. But love moves like Nyété. It enters without being noticed. First, I wanted you. Or another. But now... And you, what are you doing here? A cruise? Africa? You're stupid. - Don't look at your watch. - It's because... Because of the Gois, yes, I know. We only think of the Gois here. It's always there, watch in hand. Another 35 minutes to love you, then 20, then 5. Good. Go away. I warn you, it will not last. I'm not your Saturday's girlfriend. A storm. I love them. Come on, go home. It's going to rain. In Africa, when it was raining, I stayed outside. Go away. You're mad at me because I must leave? If I wanted, you'd stay. You see? Will you come back tomorrow? No. I have work. You will come back? Yes. Hello, sir. Dr. Vial is waiting for you. Room 13 on the first floor. How does he know? - Are you Mr. Rauchelle, veterinarian? - Yes. I was passing near your hotel and I thought that, perhaps, you would like... to have news about Nyété. - Have you seen her again? - She's fine. Thank you. Have a seat. You never see Mrs. Heller. Why? What do you care? Are you her lover? Yes, of course. I knew before you that you would become her lover. I told you already. With her, everybody has his chance, except me. But I leave jealousy to imbeciles. I am patient. I learned that in Africa too. If you are her friend... There's everything between Myriam and me, except friendship. She speaks to me a lot about her future but very little of her past. It may be better. But you know, many women do the same. You were talking the other day about what she knew. What did you mean? In Africa, most blacks try to resemble us. - Myriam went the other way. - That is to say? She got into their skin. Circumstances helped her. Her nurse was black. That girl's brother was a griot. A sorcerer, if you prefer. His name was Petit Joseph. You would like me to believe that...? Not at all. I was like you, when I arrived in Africa. And then I saw... You saw what? This Petit Joseph, for example. It was better to be friends with him. - The others had no luck. - Was he allowed to hurt people? He never went out of his house. And since one cannot be in two places at once. And you think that he killed Heller? Certainly not. He adored Myriam, he taught her everything he knew. But, personally, he had no reason. Heller fell into this quarry because of an accident. Impossible. - He committed suicide? - It was not his style. So who killed him? No one. And especially not Myriam. At the moment her husband was falling, she was at home and she was drawing this quarry precisely. If this interests you, I will give you books, and mine which will soon be released. They were not written by pranksters. "Fetishism in Black Africa", "Scientific Rehabilitation of Magic", and the best of the lot, "Culture and Superstition in Black Africa". It's you? If you hadn't come, I would have pierced your heart. Like this. Sorcerers do that in Africa. It is an extraordinary country, you know. Why didn't you stay in this extraordinary country? Not enough money. Not enough money and... too many memories. But... you really love me, right? Since you're back. You must love me, since you're always back. - We're going to leave together. - Yes, that's it. Here, we are suffocating. Over there... There, you will see, everything bursts, everything grows, everything obeys. One has only to make a sign. I'm your mistress, right? Exactly. I'm not your wife. That's it? Divorce was invented for a reason. Don't talk nonsense. You have a headache? It often happens to me. Hold on. Come here. Give me your head. Relax. Close your eyes. Another trick of yours? Did you learn that over there? Yes. And other things, too. Vial didn't tell you? It stopped? Now, it is I who hurts. What is this? It's your house. It amused me to draw from your description the place where you live with your wife. It's something like that, isn't it? It's less magnificent. And then you forgot the well. I could also draw your wife, the little bourgeoise of Colmar. Rather tall, still young, with a small nose. You saw her? Do you think I need to see to know? You're right. That's what we should do: destroy everything and leave together. Let's go, believe me. Or else, you'll see... - What happened? - A misfortune, she fell into the well! She fell into the well. That was close. Fortunately, your dog howled. Mother Capitaine heard him. She saw him, the legs on the curb. Ah! Good! That's better. François... Don't go. Now, to bed. We'll help you. No, it's okay. Thank you. Undress her. Rub her with alcohol. I felt a great tiredness. I saw the well. I approached it in spite of myself, I bend over the curb... Did you feel dizzy? No, I don't think so. And then? I flipped over. You should have called. I couldn't. Did you feel like... like you were paralyzed? Yes. - I couldn't defend myself. - To defend yourself? Against who? - I hope it won't happen again. - It won't. Be reassured. - Sleep, now. - Yes. I won't dare leave you any more. Really? I'll close the doors and come back. "It should be noted that witchcraft was often associated "with phenomena of sacred trance. "Under the influence of certain plants, "remote control of humans is possible." You can't sleep? No. What are you thinking about? We're gonna leave. What are you saying? Yes, we're gonna leave. Where to? To your home, in Colmar, or elsewhere, if you prefer. A whole month. Time to... Time for you to rest. And for me too. I'll see Verdier tomorrow. I'll arrange with him. It's all the same, if I were sick, I would have to stop. We'll leave next Saturday. Until then, I'll assume business as usual. Are you happy? Very happy. Doctor Rauchelle! That's good, Doctor. I was going to your house. I was given a letter for you to be hand delivered. "I'll tell her that I'm leaving, "that Catherine is sick. "It's over. "Over, over, over." - What are you doing here? - I was waiting for you. Watching the water go down, I was saying to myself: "He must come. I want it." You see? You came. And for greater certainty, you also wrote to me. - Nyété is sick again? - Yes. Alright. I'm going to see her. - But before, you have to know... - No. No, don't say anything. - There is a small creek. - Listen, I... - Come on. Come. What's wrong with you? Nothing. Well, there's a thing. I want to strangle you. Double dare you! You're hurting me! She hasn't eaten anything for the last 2 days. Go make us tea. No. You do it badly. I'll do it myself. We'll take it in the living room. Come, François. I'll write you a prescription. One day you'll kill her, Nyété. She must be killed. Now, get this. I wanted you to be here to tell you the good news. Soon, you won't have to see this pitiful place again. Why? I found the fool who's gonna buy this tomb. Yes. We're going to leave, you and I. In 15 days, everything will be liquidated. Anyway, I don't want to take anything from here. Except you. Hold on. I think I still have a bottle of champagne. François! Yes, come in. Ah! It's you! You bring me more good news? It's very kind of you. - Listen, I want to know... - Nice motto. Really, I can't believe that... My dear, to understand, intelligence and knowledge are not enough. You must still have faith. Ask your priest. I'm a bit rushed today. I must finish the editing of my film, "Black Science". "Black" in both senses of the word: Black Africa and black magic. - You made a movie? - It's more convincing. Film has no hallucinations. Want to see a few meters? A little local color to sacrifice to stereotypes. Have you noticed that all folk dances look the same? Auvergne or Cameroon, it's the same. Let's get down to business. This guy drank a drug. Take a good look at this chicken which walks quietly. Pay attention. - What happened to it? - It's dead. How? That is the question. All this is not very new. It's already in the Bible. "I sleep, but my heart is watching." The Song of Songs. Here is the famous Petit Joseph, the one who taught Myriam. Look at him. He draws in the dust the home of his enemy. It's pretty childish. - Have you read the books I handed you? - Yes. Yes, but... Now, tell me. Tell me what happened. - An accident? When and who? - How do you know? Catherine! You scared me. I too was afraid. It's true, I'm late. I got a flat. Why don't you turn on the light when you get into the house through the garage? I don't know. I am used to it. You're choking me. Say, Catherine, this cistern, it is no longer useful? No. You know it well. - And you never open the trapdoor? - To do what? We're gonna get it clogged. - I'm telling you this for a while. - You're right. - Someone came this afternoon. - Who? A woman. It was Mother Capitaine who received her. She told me when I came back. A customer, surely. She'll be back. I'll park the car and come back. I bet it's about the lady who came this afternoon. How was she? It was raining so she had the hood of her raincoat on. - A raincoat? - Yes. A white raincoat. - That's all I saw. - She didn't say anything? Well, no. I thought she was mistaken and looking for a doctor. - Why a doctor? - She had a bandage on her leg. A bandage? I shouted that there was no one at home, and she left. - That's all? - Yes, that's all. - I don't want Nyété to be killed. - Why do you think she'll be killed? - What happened? - It's not her fault. Madame was angry. She hit her. So, she took revenge. Nyété is proud. She doesn't like to be treated this way. That's why Mrs Heller came to my house yesterday? She didn't go to your house. Besides, I stayed with her all the time. - She took a drug. - What drug? A drug from home. The drug the griots take to sleep very hard. And to live elsewhere, they say. But they're crazy. You're sure you stayed with Mrs. Heller? - I swear. She can't set foot on the floor, anyway. - What do you want? - A comb and a mirror. What happened? Ronga didn't tell you? You must give an injection to Nyété. You must poison her. She's become wicked. Leave me alone. I will heal whenever I choose. - You haven't decided when yet? - Nyété must be killed. She scares me. - Can you be scared? You? - She's dangerous. We can't kill all dangerous beasts. What's wrong with you? Why did you go the other day? You don't love me anymore? So why did you come back? You're right to love me. You do not know what I am capable of. You're going to kill Nyété. And I'll dismiss Ronga. We'll be alone. We'll be able to leave. You will be alone. Is it your wife you think about? You love her because she bakes pastries on Sunday and loves on Saturday, when you return from the cinema? Do you call this "love"? I hate her. She's choking you. She's killing you. I wish she would die! I wanted a mirror and a comb. - What are you doing here? - I could say I was hoping to see you. There is in everything two explanations minimum. I'm leaving for Paris tomorrow. I wanted, before leaving, to see Noirmoutier from afar. I managed to arrive at the same time as the tide, so I wouldn't be tempted. How are you doing there? - You're leaving? - You seem to regret it. You had other questions to ask me? Listen... "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, "than are dreamt of in your philosophy." Everything is in Shakespeare. It's well known. Now, if you still want more details, I will offer you my book. It came out yesterday. You don't want me to sign it, I suppose. How could I write something sincere? You're not coming to bed? - I will. - Are you interested in those stories? What's the matter? A nightmare. I beg your pardon. Hello, yes? What's happening? How? She killed her? Okay. I'm coming. Hello, François. So you killed her. She didn't suffer. You needed arsenic to do this? It was fun to steal this bottle from you. - Give it back to me. - I threw it away. - Is that why you came back? - Yes. You always find a good reason to return. When you leave with me, it will be without realizing it. - Never. - But yes, in 10 days. No. I know better than you what you want. I've decided that we will take the boat to make the pleasure last. I have something to show you. Look. I already bought our tickets. The voyage will last for a minimum of seven days. It will be wonderful. Don't you think that it will be wonderful? - You're okay? - Yes. - You're happy? - Yes. It's not a great journey, but at least we breathe better. Yes. - What's the matter? - I'd like to sit down. Are you seasick? There's not a single wave. - You're not pregnant? - No. - Where did she vomit? - In the sink. - She didn't eat shellfish? - No. We ate the same. Dear friend, I'm used to being frank. She has all the symptoms of poisoning. This thirst and the smell of her vomit make think of arsenic. Are you sure? François, I'm thirsty. Give her something to drink. It's good for her. Here, drink. I will make my prescription downstairs. I'll be back. Your wife is out of luck, at present. Yes. It's Murphy's law. Her case, fortunately, seems benign. Don't get all hung up. There is arsenic everywhere, you know. I'm sure you have your pockets full of it. I'll come back tomorrow. "The chosen victim decays "or suffers inexplicable accidents. "It is impossible to save the victim as long as the author of the spell "is not reduced to impotence." Shut up! Down! What are you doing here? You're crazy! I leave tonight. I rented this car in Nantes. It's more convenient to move. - You're leaving? - Yes. I came to bid you farewell. Oh! The face you make at the thought that I'm going to leave you. You can see that you love me. I'm leaving with you. Don't worry. - Really? - Tomorrow we shall be in Paris. The formalities, a little party... Our last celebration as civilized people. - Don't you know that my wife is sick? - She'll recover. She will recover if I go with you, that's what you meant? No. I was just saying. If you're not in time tonight at the villa for low tide, I swear, François, that... See you tonight, François. I feel bad, François. Very bad. Don't worry, my dear. You're much better. If she's not better tomorrow, I'll have her transported to Nantes to run som tests. What if they find arsenic? It will simplify my life and it will complicate yours. Do you have enemies? You think I'm poisoning my wife, don't you? You know, I have 25 years of experience. I learned to think slowly. You think I did that? We are all capable of the worst. Tomorrow she will be better, I'm sure. - Really? - Yes. Okay. Let's hope so. How do you feel? Better. You'll take something to sleep. - And tomorrow... - Tomorrow you'll leave. Like every day. We gotta live. Women never understand that sometimes we have to leave them. For their own good? Exactly. It's one thing that you must tell yourself. It's for you own good. You think so? Drink that and sleep. I feel better. Won't you come to bed? Not right away, no. Sleep now. I knew you would come. The wind is low tonight. Let's wait till tomorrow. No. No. We're leaving tonight. Come on, let's hurry. No, I prefer that you let me drive. It's risky. The water goes up quickly. It's your fault. If only you had come earlier. I had to take the bus. You know that I couldn't come with my car. The wind is blowing. Let it blow. Speed up! If I go faster, I'll flood the engine, don't you know that? You don't know everything. - Shit! - What's happening? Spark plugs are getting wet. If the distributor is drowned, we're screwed. - Good Lord, that's it! - What can you do? A flooded motor cannot be repaired. You have to dry it out. So... Besides, we wouldn't have time to repair it. It's useless, the water rises at full speed. Let's move on. Come on! What are you waiting for? Hurry up. Quick. Take a suitcase. We cannot take them all. We'll leave the others. Come on and be careful. - It's not the right suitcase. - It's too late. Go up. I have to get back to the car. Let me go! I still have time. François, let me go! Myriam! But you're crazy! Myriam! Come back! You're off the road! François! Come back, Myriam! The current! I can't swim! Help! Help! I can't swim! "It is impossible to save the victim "as long as the author of the spell "is not reduced to impotence." François! You didn't leave? You drank it? Answer me! You drank it? You're not... - Give me this letter. - No! What's this? I'll tell you everything. If you had left, I would have sent you this letter... after. I dare not understand. Then it's you who would have... I'm angry with you, Francois. You have made me a wicked and desperate woman. Two months ago, I saw you transformed, happy. You were very kind with me. But, my happiness, I owed it to someone else. You had discovered many things. You wanted to be forgiven. Go on, I'm listening. One day I caught that black girl who took pictures of the house. They wanted to know the framework of your life. This Ronga told me everything. Then the well, the trapdoor, the arsenic... - All this was a comedy? - Not the well. In the beginning, I really wanted to die. But when I regained consciousness and I saw your anguish... I thought... that you still loved me. You seemed to believe that I was pushed into the well and that I was the victim of... I don't know what practice. So... with Ronga... With Ronga? It's her who had the idea of the raincoat. Mother Capitaine saw me go on a bicycle. I went around the house, I donned the raincoat, I bandaged my ankle and I went back to the road. When you found the trapdoor, I had hope again. You were so mad. But she always took you back. I wanted her to die. To die? I finally learned that she wanted to go with you and I knew that you would not have the courage to refuse. So I took some arsenic. Not to die, but to force you to stay. So you even did that! When the first pains burned my stomach... it hurt so bad. How I cursed you, the two of you. But I wanted you to believe that it was her who was killing me. In the end, it was true. Wasn't it? That's it. That's all. Now, tell me that she left alone. As you can see. I let her go. François! François! François, I beg your pardon! François! Don't go!
