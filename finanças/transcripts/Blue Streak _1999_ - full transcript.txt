As of now, Detective Malone is Burglary's new acting lead detective. - Get these processed, A.S.A.P. - Yes, sir. Uh, thank you. Carlson, Carlson. I got things I gotta do. Okay. I'll catch up with you later. Okay. Hey. I'll take these. You know what to do with these ? Sure I do. Okay, great, sir. Sorry. [ Woman ] Captain Penelli ? [ Man ] I'm busy right now. Jeez. [ Moaning ] [ Gagging ] - Oh, man ! Mm. - [ Gagging ] [ Keyboard Keys Clacking ] Oh, shit ! [ Echoing ] Damn ! [ Echoing ] Malone. What ? Yeah. What ? How do you want me to handle the rotation ? Uh, rotation. I don't understand. What do you mean, rotation ? The shifts. [ Chuckles ] Look, Hardcastle. I can't figure out everything on the first day, all right ? I was noticing that you guys had a leak up here. What's that about ? One of the hot water pipes burst. - Flooded all the vents. - Vents ? They had to flush out the whole system. Big pain in the ass. This must be the new guy everybody's talkin' about. Captain Penelli, Detective Malone. Malone, Penelli. I hear great things. It's a pleasure to meet you. [ Moaning ] [ Sniffing ] N-N-Nice to meet you too, there, sir. Very nice to meet you. You know, glad to be here. Gotta go ! He's a strange one. Oh, yeah. Place is closed. I said, we're closed. I should've locked up. Nice to see you, Lou. I'm lookin' for Miles. Yeah, well, uh, I haven't seen him. I got this message from his mother, and it's really important. Oh. Well, I still haven't seen him. [ Groans ] Shh. Be quiet. Damn, you're good.

He's gonna be heading up our Burglary division. Detective, tell us a little about your plans. I... Well, I plan to fight crime. [ Karate Yells ] You know, shit like that. Great, then. Great. All right, does anybody have any questions for Detective Malone ? Yeah, I got a question. What do you think about the P-31 ? P-31 ? What do you think ? - I think it's a piece of shit. - Diaz. What I mean to say is, we've all been having problems with the P-31, right ? I'm just wondering what the new lead detective here plans to do about it. Well, all right. Well, uh, Diaz, is it ? Diaz ? [ Diaz ] With a "Z." What do you think we should do about it, Diaz ? I think we should scrap it. How many people think we should scrap the P-31 ? - [ Murmuring ] - [ Miles ] There it is. Scrapped. You know why ? 'Cause you want it scrapped. It's out of there. P-31. Out of there. No more. Gone. You want 31 flavors ? Baskin and Robbins is where you want to be. Be cool. That's my partner. Yeah. [ Diaz ] Oh, yeah ? Detective ? What is it ? - I'd like to work with the P-40. - Yeah, the P-40's good. P-40 it is ! What the hell's he doing ? We just got those things. He's shaking things up. Maybe that's exactly what we need. [ Applause Continues ] I'm not a cop. [ Hardcastle ] Malone. This Tulley asshole's been screaming he wants to talk to you. He's down at Interrogation. Uh, okay. Right away. I'll talk with him. [ Whistles ] Interrogation's this way, hmm ? Knew that. Is he runnin' his mouth ? So he says he has information about another robbery, but he says he'll only talk to the officer who arrested him. Okay, well, uh, I'll talk to him, alone. We'll be watching. Okay. What the hell's goin' on, man ? You said I'd only spend one night in jail ! Shut up ! [ Mumbling ] [ Grunting ] [ Mumbling, Grunting Continue ] Shut up ! Shut up. What'd you want to say ? What is it ? You said I was only gonna spend one night in jail. It's only been one night. Where's my 50 grand ? Fifty... I said 20 grand. Well maybe it's 50 now, 'cause I need... [ Screaming ] [ Groaning, Yelling ] Detectives, I've been assigned to Mr. Tulley. Great. That's him. [ Shouting ] Oh, my God ! What in the world... [ Woman ] What's going on ? - Help ! - What is this ? Oh, my God ! Help ! I'll tell you everything ! Take your hands off my client ! [ Grunting ] It's no use. He ain't talkin'. That's because you have your hand over his mouth ! Mmm ! Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think we, uh, accomplished enough for one day. Wait a second. This guy said he has information on another case. Now, I wanna know, are you jerking our chain or not ? I'm not jerkin' your chain, fella. This guy Logan owes me $50,000. If I don't get it soon, I'm talking ! All right ! Who's Logan, and what do you know about him ? All I can tell you, sir, is that he's gay. Gay ! Gay ! - That's it. I had enough of this... - We certainly have. Come with me. You're gonna be hearing from my office, Detective. He made me bite my tongue. Mm-hmm. Come here. Next time, use a phone book on him. And he took my shoelaces. Hearing from your office. Look how she's all over him. Oh ! And then he said I was ugly and I couldn't read good. Malone. Oh, hey, man. What's up ? Where the hell you been ? Some guy's been callin' for you. Who was it ? Said he was your old partner. Said he hopes you found what you've been lookin' for, because your health benefits are about to expire, whatever the hell that's supposed to mean. Shit ! Bingo ! Yeah ! What is it with you and the heating ducts, sir ? Um... [ Shivers ] Cold, Carlson. You don't feel that ? Very cold. But I'm busy. What is it you want ? Well, uh, I just tried to pull up your records, and I couldn't find any Malone. Are you worrying about... That's-That's probably because it was spelled, um... I know when I had put the name in the list... Sir, the badge number doesn't exist. Yeah. Let me talk to you for a minute. I just wanna find out what's going on. You're gonna find out. Let me just talk to you for a sec. Now, look. What I'm about to tell you is classified. You tell anyone, I will bust your ass down to parade detail. I've been on that detail. You've been on it ? That's permanent horseshit patrol. Yes, sir. Okay, this place is a cesspool. No ! Yeah, but listen. I'm not from West Covina. I'm from Internal Affairs. Oh, man ! I know. Shh... [ Mumbling ] All right ? This place is a cesspool. I can't believe I didn't notice. Well, it is ! I mean, it-it doesn't seem like a cesspool. Well, believe it, man ! There's a lot of dirty shit going on here. That's why they sent me here, all right ? The supercop here. They said, "Go in there and investigate. Do what you do. "Find another supercop. You all supercop up as a team and crack down the shit. Crack it down." And that's what I'm here to do. I mean, are we the only guys that know about it ? Jesus, we're in the shit now ! Shh, shh ! [ Grunting ] Okay. You are a good cop, Carlson. Okay. But damn it, man, you just dug too deep. Yes, sir, okay. What do you want me to do ? Good thing you asked. Keep your eyes open, okay ? I need you to be here, okay ? Okay. And watch my back. Watch my back. You got it, sir. Okay ? No, the other way. Go back. Yeah. [ Sighs ] Shit ! Yeah, Evidence room. Shit ! Malone ! Hmm ? Oh, there you are. I just got a call. There's a 4-13 in progress at the airport. Well, y'all go ahead. I'll catch up. Bullshit you'll catch up. Someone just stole a museum exhibit from a cargo hold. That's my problem ? You're lead detective. I want you to get you ass out there now ! But... The F.B.I. and Customs Service is already on the case. Why are you standing out here ? They won't let me in. The Feds are all over. That's bullshit. It'll take a while. These boxes contained an entire Egyptian temple. Excuse me, here. Let me see this. Man ! And who are you ? Uh, Malone. L.A.P.D. Agent Gray, F.B.I. We'll let you boys in after we're done. Look at all this stuff. Look at this. I mean, they nearly destroyed all this stuff, and they didn't take none of it. Look, Officer Malone... Detective. I really don't have time to stand here and hold your hand. You're out of your jurisdiction and you're over your head. Oh, I'm over my head ? No, I'm over your head, 'cause your head's up your ass. You're interfering with a federal investigation, Officer. Now, if you and your bunch wanna feel important, you can help secure the outer perimeter. Are we clear ? Yeah. We clear. And please, tell your men not to touch anything on their way out. It's like that ? Yeah, it's like that. [ Carlson ] "Head up your ass." That was great. I couldn't believe you said that. He called me "officer." I am lead detective. I have 16 citations. You think that shit comes easy ? Come on. The guy's nothing but an F.B.I. asshole. He thinks we're good for nothing but sucking down doughnuts. Screw him. Let them chase their own goddamn temple. They weren't lookin' for no temple. They were lookin' for drugs. Drugs ? Yes, drugs. It's the oldest trick in the book. You smuggle it in, boost it before it hits customs. Huh ? Right ? Right ? Make it look like a heist. That's how all the big boys do it. All they have to do... is look for a truck with the letter "B" on it. What do you mean, "B" ? Bonded. Bonded trucks can get into bonded warehouses. Let me ask you something. How do you know all this stuff ? Did a little work in bonded warehouses. All right, then. So what are we waiting for ? I mean, let's do something, all right ? Call in air support. Dispatch, this is 37-King-5. Put me through to South Bay Air Support. [ Man On Police Radio ] 10-12, I've got a white panel truck, B-9-6, southbound on Wheeler near the Manhattan Beach intersection. Roger. That's it. We're close. - [ Tires Screeching ] - Whoa ! Now you're in a hurry ? Well, sometimes you gotta feed a little speed to your ride. You know what I'm saying ? [ Miles ] Here we go. Check out the driver. Yeah. Five foot six, greasy hair, messy, very disheveled... Are you a hairdresser or a detective, man ? That's a jailhouse tat. Driver's did a stretch somewhere. [ Carlson ] 10-12, requesting backup. L.A.P.D., this is Agent Gray, F.B.I. Stand down. I repeat, stand down. - This is bullshit. - Hey, screw them. Come on ! Let's do it ! Come on, you ! Come on. Come on. Come on ! Drop your weapons ! Put 'em down ! Don't move ! Stand still ! Shit ! - Put 'em down ! - Malone, take him ! He's yours ! [ Groans ] Don't you run from me ! Don't you run ! All right, let's see those hands, huh, butterball ? Come here ! You want to make me run ? [ Groans ] Come back here ! [ Tires Screech, Horn Honks ] Aah ! Come back here ! Don't do that ! Bring your ass here ! Come here ! - I'm not playin' ! - [ Groans ] I'm not playin' games ! Come here ! - [ Screaming ] - Everything's okay. Don't worry. I'm a cop. All right ? It's all right. All right ? Damn ! Don't you know better than to run from the police ? - I do. - You got me tired. You know that ? I don't like to get tired. When I get tired, that means I got ass to whup. And I think that's what I'm about to do. Get your ass up ! [ Indistinct Police Radio Chatter ] Bingo. That's the shit. [ Applause ] We showed them. We showed them, and that's what I wanted to do, you know ? Book this into Evidence. Exactly. Evidence, exactly. I'm gonna go up with it. No, no, no. I want you to interrogate those men right now. Oh, no, no. See, I need to go up with this stuff... and book it into Evidence personally. Why ? I gotta go through for clues and shit. First, you gotta interrogate the suspects. Find out where they were going. Then when you get them to talk, you can go through all the evidence you want. But, sir, know that... If I get the clue, I think it would make for a better ass-whupping in the interrogation room. Let's hear it for Detective Malone ! [ Chattering, Indistinct ] [ Groans ] That's it ! I want a lawyer. You cops can't do this. I got news for you. I ain't a cop. Oh, you... Come on ! God, he's good. I checked him out. West Covina never heard of him. So you know. Know what ? He's Internal Affairs. What the hell you talkin' about ? He's not I.A. He's not ? - Hell no. He's F.B.I. - [ Screams ] But he hates the F.B.I. That's just to throw you off. You think this whole thing's an accident ? He knew about the heroin thing from the start. F.B.I. probably planted him here, thinking he'd get first jump on the burglary call, afraid we'd screw it up. Pencil-dicks. Wow. [ Groaning ] - You don't get that kind of training at the academy. - No, that's old school, man. You're crushing my head ! [ Groaning ] That's federal government training. Like Navy SEAL stuff, yeah. Come on. Let's go give him a hand. All right ! All right ! I'll talk ! I'll talk ! Oh, man ! [ Door Buzzer Sounds ] Oh. Ooh, look at you. - It was all worth it for you, baby. - Malone ! Oh ! [ Groans ] Malone ! What the hell are you doing up there ? Um, I'm just so happy... that we keeping these drugs off the street. - Well, get over it. They're going right back out again. - Why ? 'Cause the F.B.I. wants to take it to their lab right away. Roll it out. But... [ Straining ] Malone, come on ! Let's go. Come on, Malone. Detective. Malone. That heroin belongs to Jean LaFleur. We've been after him for five years, but he keeps shifting his operations between the U.S. and Mexico. We're taking it down to our lab right now. I don't think that's such a good idea. Why not ? Um... Why don't we just keep it here with us ? LaFleur doesn't know we have it. We could use it for bait. You mean a sting ? Exactly ! A sting. Now, LaFleur expects these drugs to be in San Diego in three hours. What kind of sting operation can you get off the ground before then ? The driver told me one of the guys on the truck was new. You can replace him with somebody else, then catch LaFleur when he goes to pick up the drugs. Bam ! Got him ! Let me get this straight. You're volunteering to escort these drugs right into the hands... of the most dangerous drug dealer in the Northern Hemisphere ? - Hell no ! - What do you need to make it work, Malone ? Me ? Absolutely ! You're the man for the job. F.B.I.'s gonna have tactical command, but we're gonna follow your lead. That's very brave of you, Detective. Let's get goin'. We don't have much time. Come on. Way to go, Malone. Way to go. I'm just suggestin' some shit y'all can do. We need more men like you. All right, hurry up. Go. Get out of here before somebody sees you. Wait ! Hold up. Wait a minute. You wanted to go. I'm gettin' you out of here. Go ! No, you wouldn't still be here unless that diamond was here. I want my cut ! Ain't nothin' to cut. I'm tryin' to, but I gotta get the diamond first. Well, go get it. I'll wait. I'm tryin' to. But first, I gotta run this sting on this drug dealer. - You're a goddamn liar ! - Would I make this shit up ? Now, go, Tulley ! Get out of here. I'll see you at Lou's tomorrow. I want to talk about this. Wait a minute. I don't know what you're doin', Get out of here. but it ain't gonna work. Hey ! Let me get my gun back ! Ow ! Hey, look, maybe this isn't a good idea, you know ? Sir, this is a great idea. It'll work. It's brilliant. Now, LaFleur's gonna be lookin' for this. We know what we're doing, Detective. - Oh, I'm a detective now ? - Detective, can you give us a level, please ? - [ Barking ] - [ Feedback In Headphones ] - [ Gray ] All right. The objective here is to have these individuals look upon you as if you were one of them, a member of the criminal underworld. So it's important that your actions, your speech... and your general mode of behavior is all congruent... with their expectation of a fellow criminal. Oh, okay, I get it. Sort of walk the walk. Yeah. That's right. You have to look, act and even think like a criminal. And you're gonna have to change your speech patterns too. Most criminals like to use slang terminology, profanity and so forth, especially with regard to police and authority figures. Oh, you mean like, "Shut the hell up, you dickless F.B.I." ? That's right. That'll do. "You stupid-ass... " - I said, that'll do. Enough ! - No, "You tight-ass... " [ Penelli ] All right, listen up. LaFleur's a killer. If he senses anything amiss, Malone is going to be in one hell of a tight spot. I got it. We're gonna act in concert with the F.B.I. today. Carlson, if anything happens to me, forget everything I ever told you. You mean about Internal Affairs ? No, Carlson. I mean about everything. [ Gray ] Detective, saddle up. Okay ? Okay. Good luck. Carlson, remember. Forget it. Time to go. Detective, if my client gets so much as a scratch on him while he's in your custody, I won't stop until your badge is revoked and you're thrown in jail. Okay ? You got me ? You can't touch me. [ Horn Honks ] Ow ! Detective ! He'll be fine, Counselor. Malone, let's get this show on the road. Drive. Buckle up. All right, give me video. [ Driver On Radio ] Let's get one thing straight. This is my side over here, and that's your side over there. You stay on your side, and I'm gonna stay on mine. Okay ? Gentlemen, let's keep the chatter to a minimum. Hey, you don't like the show, change the channel. Hey, keep this channel clear. ♪♪ [ Rap On Car Stereo ] - Who is this guy ? - That's Malone. - I can't drive if you're gonna do that. - Drive ! ♪♪ [ Continues ] ♪♪ ♪♪ All right, we're comin' up on our exit.

Now, you got two choices. You can wind up somebody's bitch, or you can wind up somebody's senorita. Make up your mind. It's your choice. No. I got three choices, okay ? Maybe I just tell them who you are, huh ? No, you gonna shut your mouth, 'cause maybe I cut you back in on the diamond, huh ? Shithead, I got the goddamn diamond. Let me get that up out of you.

F.B.I. needs to talk to you, Detective Malone. [ Sighs ] Peterson, regional director, F.B.I. We need to talk. Wait a minute. Slow down. No, Lieutenant, I will not slow down. Is this man one of yours or not ? You bet your ass he is. Well, I'm gonna find out what happened here, even if it means putting your entire department under federal review. Malone. Nice work. Yeah ? [ Exhales ] Okay, Malone. My office just spent the last hour talking to West Covina... and to the U.S. Attorney's Office trying to find out... just who the hell it is you're working for. Now we know it's not the bureau. I think it's time that you gave us an explanation. I'm a federale. - A federale ? - Whoa ! Look across that border. Huh ? What do you see ? That is the Democratic Republic of Mexico. - You're Mexican ? - That's right, on my mother's father's side. - Yeah, I guess I can see it. - "Glacias," thank you. Yeah, but... Gentlemen, I shouldn't be telling you all this. - I could lose my federale-hood. - Your what ? My federale-hood. Look, I had to throw you guys off, okay ? I was doin' it for my country. The red, the white... and the green. Now, if you guys will excuse me, I'm gonna have to get across this border and school some of my compadres, you know, just on some things that we like to talk about. So, y'all stay up. Be cool. K-K-K-K-K-K-Kay ! Tengo el gato los pantalones. El nino ! What's happenin' ? Hook a brother up with a taco ! A burrito ! K-K-K-K-K-K-Kay ! I can't believe so much bad shit can happen on such a beautiful day. Malone ! Malone ! Yeah ? What ? I think your Spanish is a little rusty. You just told those men... you got a big cat in your pants. Oh... Well, you know, that's a Latin thing. Macho. Yeah, yeah, you wouldn't understand. No, I think I do understand. - Logan. - What ? Uh, how'd you know it was me ? I started thinking if I was Miles Logan... and I had my diamond hidden in a police building, what would I do ? So I thought like a crook. Is that right ?
