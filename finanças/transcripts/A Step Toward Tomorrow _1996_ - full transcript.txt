I forgive myself forgiving you so many chances, and I forget whatI ever saw in you. Is this gonna delayour trip to New York?! Can I have a littleprivacy here, please?

Oh, what,are you telling me you ran out of doctorsin Idaho? I mean, come on, Anna! Sooner or later, you'regonna have to face the facts. Face the facts? What does that mean,"face the facts"? What are the facts?Huh, Jim? Who knows whatthe facts are? You? Me? Some med school graduate who'smemorized 50 anatomy books? You don't mean"face the facts." You mean accept a bad handthat's been dealt you. No thanks! I might not be ableto improve anything, but you know what,I am not giving upwithout a fight.

There's no need for meto rush into a new school. And tamperwith your education, this, your final year beforejoining the work force? Mom, I'm inthe seventh grade. When I was your ageI didn't even go to school. I just walked ten milesa day, barefoot. Good night.Good night. ♪ (sighs) (Georgie, echoing)Mom! I'm here, babe! Mom! I'm right here, Georgie! Mom! (shrieks) (sighs) (school bell rings) (children giggling) (students chattering) Class? This is Ben Lerner. He's our new pupilfrom Idaho. Ben, why don't youtell us about yourself. I've got a brother. (students chuckling) Hey, don't potatoescome from Idaho? Yes, they do,Derek. That is very smart. Ben, why don't youhave a seat? (students laugh) (boy)Good shot, man.That was good. Hey, potato head. (clears throat loudly) (teacher)Okay, everybody,take our your textbooks and turn to page 113,chapter four. (Georgie)Mom, we're gonna be late. (Anna)Who'd of thoughtit would be so hard to park at a hospitalin Georgia? (Georgie)There's a spot. (Anna)Great. (honks horn) It's a restricted area. I know, but I'd liketo park here anyway. I'm sorry,it's a restricted area. I can read. I'll take my chancesgetting a ticket. I need to park here. Yeah, well, uh,rules are rules. Be right back. Listen, I've been ridingaround here forever. I can't finda handicapped spot. I'm late for a doctor'sappointment and you knowhow doctors are. So, if you could just help meout, I'd really appreciate it. Okay?You're a prince. (car door closes) Hey, hey. (woman)You okay, Georgie? I guess so.(beep) Here we go. (loud pulsing) All right,sorry I'm late. I had a little troubleparking my bike. I'm sorry. I didn't wanna be lateto meet... you. (Georgie)Ben told youwe should've left earlier. Uh, yeah, uh,I'm Anna Lerner, and this is my son,Georgie. I'm Dr. Decker.It's nice to meet you. Hi, Georgie.Hi. I probably shouldn't have beenparking my bike there anyway. Okay, let's seewhat we have. So, Georgie,it's been two years sincethe accident, all right? You have a fracture/dislocationin vertebrae T7 and T8. Bone growthat the injury site. Incomplete paralysisof both legs. It looks like you've seenquite a few specialists. Failure of lower back muscles,chronic pain and spasm. It's been a hardcouple of years, hmm? Okay, Georgie. I want you to doyour pushups for me. Can you do that? (Georgie grunting) Does that hurt? It hurts to shift.It hurts not to shift. And his left hand's gettinga little weaker, too. Mm, would you say the painwas worse now than it was... say, a month ago? Worse. Spasms? Uh, first the spasmswere a problem when we cut backon that pain medication. They're more frequent now,no matter how medicatedhe is. (door opens) Here's the study. Thank you. Georgie, why don't you go withJoe and have a popsicle on me. Okay? I wanna talk to your momabout some boring stuff. Okay. (woman over PA)Dr. Michaels, radiology. Dr. Michaels, radiology. After an MRI, you qualityfor orange or banana. So, what's itgonna be, Georgie? Thanks, but I don'treally want one. Okay... Well, I'll tell you what. I'll leave 'emright here just in case youchange your mind. You never know. I'll come and check on youin a few minutes, okay? (man)Hey, if you're not gonnaeat both of those, I could use a bite. (patients chattering) (man)I'm over here. Could use a little help,though. Come on over. (woman over PA)Dr. Ligori, call the page operator. Dr. Ligori, call the page operator. Orange or banana? Oh, I thought maybeyou had pineapple. Never mind. What's your name? Georgie. I'm Denny Gabriel, hi. You know, MRIscan be real scary. But if you close your eyes anduse your imagination a little... it feels like you'regoing deep sea diving. What's wrong with you? Huh, well, you ask mewhat's wrong with me, I can tell you in a second. But if you ask mewhat's right with me, we can talkfor a long time. Have you beendeep sea diving? Yep, I love the ocean. You know, one time last year,just before my accident, I was out on a boat. I was out on a boat,and this whale all of a suddencame right up beside us. Was it giant? Scary. Well, I thoughtit'd be scary, but it wasn't 'causeyou know what he did? What? He rolled over and he lookedup at me with one eye. And you can call me crazy, butI think he was smiling at me. Wow. You're not kidding me,are you? About not being scared. ♪ My mom pretendsshe's not afraid, but I think she is. Does that mean she alreadyknows something? Well, I think it meansshe knows that in time you're gonna geta lot better. Yeah... in time. You know, I never had a chanceto go deep sea diving... or have a whalesmile at me. Well, you know what? Those researchersknow a lot more now they did six months ago. And I'll bet you,by the time you're my age, you're gonna be out thereracing those whales. Do you really think so? I'm counting on it. And maybe... maybe I'll see youout there. All right, there may bea syrinx here causing some hand dysfunctionand increased spasticity. It's hard to tell. If a syrinx is present,it could do additional damage. Add that to the factthat he's a growing boy, and there are several factors that could contributeto the pain. Heard it, seen it.How do we fix it? Uh, well, for now,um, to relieve his pain, we could do thatwith more medication. Or increase the increasethe Baclofen for the spasticity. Why don't you justhit him over the headwith a wooden mallet? You'd getthe same result. The drugs aremaking him a zombie. All right, um... An alternative would beto administer the Baclofen directly into his spinewith a pump. He's had a bad reactionto Baclofen. I don't want Georgie to spendhis whole life on drugs. Listen, we-- we went throughthe paces in Idaho. The physical therapy,the meditation, the psychotherapy. He's tried glutamate blockers,4-Aminopyridine, Naloxone, Piromen, TRH,Tirilazad, Colchicine. And let's not overlookgood ol' Methylprednisolone. Right, well, then I don't haveto tell you the difficulties in overcoming this kindof pain and spasticity. No, you don't. And you can't. 'Cause you don'tlive with him. You don't have to seehis body racked with pain. You don't have to seea muscle spasm throw him out of hiswheelchair onto the floor. My son can't playwith other children. His muscles are atrophiedfrom lack of use. I know the difficulties. I don't justread about 'em. I live with them. I understand. Absolutely, of course. Um... what I wouldlike to do is, uh, consult with a colleagueof mine, Dr. Sandlin. Oh, the "anotheropinion" ploy? That's medical talk for,"beats me," isn't it? Dr. Sandlin is the team leaderfor spinal chord injuries. She's, um--Dr. Decker... Couple of years ago, I was a waitress ata greasy spoon in Idaho, preoccupied witha lousy marriage and trying to figure out howI lost control of my life. Then my son got injured. Suddenly, I realized howtrivial my worries were. I also realized youtake control of your life or you let itsteamroll over you. My son is my priority.Time is not on his side. As he gets older,he'll get worse. So, you get Sandlinoff the golf course and you consult with her,but you make it fast. And you tell her thatGeorgie is a perfect candidate for a Spinal Cord Stimulator. Uh, wait,wait-wait-wait. Okay... All right, placing a probewithin a spinal cord... to, um, administera controlled voltage to stimulatean injured cord... has helped some people,but it is not without risk. Now, placing a probein a child's spine that's still growingand developing... it's difficult. On top of that,this is a proceduredecided by committee. It is usedas a last resort. This is our last resort. Four out of ten casesget some relief from pain, and some have even experiencedincreased mobility. I read about it inthe "Journal of Medicine." Once the pain is gone,Georgie may havesome mobility, but we won't know untilwe get rid of those spasms. I know the risks involved. I don't want my sonliving in constant pain! Look, we came a reallylong way to see you. Our lives were turnedupside down by this accident, and I've put everything we hadleft on the line to be here. Georgie has to havethat operation. (sighs) (children shouting) Block it! Don't let himget it in! Uhh! Oh, gee, I'm...I'm so sorry about that. Spud head. (students laughing) Forget it, Ben. (brakes squeak) That Hastingsis a real jerk. You're just gonnahave to avoid him. Unless you gota death wish. Yeah. Hey,see you tomorrow. See ya. I was thinking, we couldput some carpeting in the den. And paint the living roomany color you boys want as long as it's peach. Shouldn't yoube leaving? God, I don't wanna be late,as least for a few days. Wish me luck. Good luck. Don't stay uptoo late, Ben. And no hookers. Goodbye, Mom. You have my numberif there's a problem. There won't be. Hey, Mom!Yup? Pittsburgh!P-I-T-T. Go get 'em, Mom! Hsss. This is what I callour satellite room. The wave of the futurefor the airline industry. No need to locatein big cities, thanks to the computersand modems. See, I'm what they,uh, call a "Lone Eagle." I understandyou're divorced. If I wasn't a happilymarried man, I'd be real excitedabout you starting here. Don't let a casualthing like marriage come between us,Lone Eagle. (laughing) Just kidding,Mr. Arners. (both laughing) You-- You're a realfirecracker, aren't you? Just a little cherry bomb. Uh, this will beyour station over here. You'll be workingbeside Monica. (rain spattering) (thunder rumbling) Hand me that Phillips. (loud thunderclap,electricity sizzles) Ben! Ben! Don't worry,I'll get the flashlights. Just a second. It's dark, hurry! Here. Relax, the lightswill come back on soon. The storm's gonna pass. Mom's gonna be excitedwe're fixing the cabinet. Okay, shine it up here. Toss me that rag. This door will be perfect. (Georgie moaning) Georgie! (continues moaning) George, it's okay!It hurts! I got you, Georgie,it's okay. Let it go, it'll pass. It's just a spasm.You're gonna be all right. (crying)Don't be scared, Georgie. See, look,I'm rubbing your leg. It's gonna make youfeel better.Hurry, Ben! It's okay. It'll be fine,you'll be all right. Look, I'm bendingyour legs now. It's gonna make youfeel better, okay? One, two, three.Oww! Okay, now we'll dothe other one, all right? One, two, three. (grunting and crying) It's all right. It's gonna be okay. (crying) You'll be fine. It was just likethe accident, Ben. I couldn't breathe. Under the water. I don't likethe dark, Ben. Don't worry...I'm here, Georgie. I'm not gonna let you go. I promise. (Ben grunting softly) (moaning softly) Honey? Honey, it's okay,it's me. You having a bad dream? Hi.Hi. How'd it go? A-okay. Commercial aviationwill never be the same. How's the kid? Still afraid of the dark. Ben, I don't knowwhat I'd do without you. Do we make a great teamor do we make a great team? I guess. You guess? Ladies and gentlemen,he "guesses." (chuckling) If I loved you anymore,I think you'd explode. Sure. Night, soldier. Night. (screen door creaks) (Anna laughing) (Anna)Okay, which one do you want? I'll do it for youjust this once. (Anna, scoffing)Cat's game. What are you doing? Trying to makepainting fun. (grunts) Grab a brush, Ben,I'll play you. Any word? Still waiting. (phone rings)I'll get it. Hello? Miss Lerner? Dr. Decker here. Yes... Hello, uh, h--how are you? I'm fine, thank you. Listen,I'm calling to let you know that I metwith Dr. Sandlin today. (Anna)Yeah? And she's gotsome serious concerns about neuroimplantationon Georgie. He's so young. And he's younger than anyone we've tried in on before. Oh, okay. And? Well, I told her, uh, everythingthe boy's been through. That I've seen him,I've met with him. I spent time with him. And that, in my opinion,I think he'll come through. Hello? (fighting tears)Yes, I'm here. And did sheagree with you? Well, she'd like youto bring Georgie in so she can checkhim out herself. I, uh, it's a--it's a very good sign. And we were wondering if Thursday at 10:00 would be okay. (stamping feet) (Anna, softly)Yes! (sighs) We'll be there. Great. Great. I look forward to seeing you...and Georgie. Thursday at 10:00. (phone beeps off) Evaluation,Thursday at 10:00. Mm! Is, uh, Ben, here? Ben? Ben...Rings a bell. A kid aboutyour height? Full set of teeth?Kinda good-looking? Mom... these are someof the guys from school. Perry and Kevin. Chile cheese corn? Thought you'd never ask. Hey, Ben,you ready to go? We told you we'd be byon Saturday, remember... Um... that's my brother,Georgie. What happened? Bear attack. About a year ago,we were out on a picnic. Nice sunny day. We were eating potatosalad, I think. Suddenly, out of the blue,like that! I realizedI forgot the pepper. So, I go to get it, forgetting we'rein bear country. And wouldn't you know it,out of nowhere, bear comes, grabs Georgie in his mouthand runs off, biting him all the way! Holy cow! A bear had youright in his mouth? Don't listen to her,it was a diving accident. Well-- I thought mine wasa lot more interesting. Georgie? I like Mom's. Listen, guys, I'm gonna hang out herewith my brother. Ben, you're alwayshogging Georgie. Today he's mine. You go with these twofine young lads. Either of you beento jail? (both)No. Then, Ben, go. Have fun for a change. Go, Ben. Ben... Have youbeen to jail? (boys laughing) (screen door creaks open) (door closes) (grunts) What's wrong, honey? I need another pill. Coming up. (pill rattling) (grunts) I'm tired of hurting, Mom. I know--I know you are, honey. I know you are,but you're doing so good. Dr. Decker'sgonna help us. Just try to stay strong. (crying)What if he can't help, Mom? I'm tired of all thosedoctors poking at me. All they do is justtalk... and look. They don't fix it. Can we stopafter this one? (crying softly) Course we'll stop,honey. Course we will. 'Cause thisis gonna help. We won't need anydoctors after this. We won't. (crying) Unfortunately, the pathto the swimming hole goes right by the cemetery, which is why we'renever here after dark. Come on, this way. (Ben)Who's that? (Perry)That's Kirby. He's crazy. Is he really crazy? All he does is haul arounddead people all day. (Perry)Rumor has it theyweren't all dead. If you get my meaning. Never make directeye contact with him. That fires uphis bloodlust. Kevin's gota theory. I don't thinkhe's human. I think we'retalking Zombie. I think we're talkingwalking dead. (Perry)Come on, let'sget out of here. (distant children playing) Come on, we'realmost there. Here it is. All this is ours. (splashing) Aah! Dr. Decker? Anna... Georgie,what a nice surprise. (Georgie)Hi. Hi, and pleasecall me David. What are you doingall the way out here? I'm getting my bike fixed. My whole bike clubcomes here. So, it's, um, worththe ten-mile drive. You really take thisbike thing seriously. Yeah, well, actually,I just joined. I'm trying to get out--outside more. Trying to smell the roses,so to speak. Actually, my friendsthought I should get a life, so I joined a club. It's a great stressreliever, um... One of these daysyou should join us. Do it, Mom. Uh... I'm looking fora hammock club, myself. All right, okay,well, you think about it. Listen, I've gotta go. I'll see both of you soon. Thursday. Oh, right. Bye. When you say diving accident,what exactly do you mean? I mean diving. Well, was it a diving boardor a cliff in Acapulco? What? ♪ We were on a bridge...about two years ago. Here I come! It was a beautiful day. All the guys were there. We were diving offthe old railroad trestle. I'm comin'! (Ben)No one saw the log. He was paralyzedwhen he hit the log. (Anna)M-R-I. It's a test. It was requestedby Dr. Decker. D-E-C-K-E-R. You approved himbefore I left Idaho. Anna Lerner. L-E-R-N-E-R. No! It's undermy husband's policy. Well... you bettercheck again. Listen, let me talkto a supervisor. You're obviously notfamiliar with my file. These costsshould be covered. You know what,you want to jerk me around, you're gonna have to do itin person, 'cause I'mcoming down there. I wanna see a supervisor! (slams down receiver) (man)Well, now, as your policyexplains, you subscribeto a Managed Care program. Now this gives completecoverage to your family if you use our physiciansand our hospitals, and if we approveof their procedures. Now, we don't coverimplantation of electrodes for spinal cord stimulation. (scoffs) You mean there'san operation that may alleviate my son'spain and you won't cover it? Mrs. Lerner, we've been verygenerous in regards to your son. We won't coverSpinal Cord Stimulation. Rules are rules. Well, screw the rules. I mean, there's gotta bea loophole or-- or something. You--Have a little compassion. Mrs. Lerner... I'm notthe cold-heart bastard who doesn't care. Unfortunately, there isa reality that we cannot ignore. And that is that you payinto the system and it pays outaccording to specific rules. It's that simple. You know, I shouldremind you that... a positive attitudeis important in these matters. Has your son...tried meditating? Don't do this to me. Don't do this to my son. Not now. We're so close. I-- I don't wanta free ride. I'll pay premiums. Extra premiums forever. I don't want to breakany rules. I just want to help my son. I'm all he's got. You understand? I can't fail. So don't sit therebehind that desk and tell me you're notthe bad guy, because you are. You should not be ableto accept your paycheck from a companyin clear conscience that treats people like cogsin a wheel. I don't give a damnwhat your policy says. You took my money andyou promised medical care. (fighting tears)This isn't a game. We're talking aboutliving people here. You can't see a newprocedure come along and refuse to get involvedbecause it isn't "recognized" because you haven'tbroken down the costs. People need doctors... not self-serving, gutlessbureaucrats like you. (sobbing) (door opens) How'd it go today? It went. What'dthe insurance man say? (scoffs)He said a lot of things. Mom, what didthe insurance man say about the operation? They're not gonnapay for it. How can the insurance companynot pay for the operation? That's what insurance is for. It's more complicatedthan that, Ben. He has to getthe operation, Mom! How do you supposeI'm supposed to pay for it? I don't knowand I don't care! What do you want me to do,print the money, rob a bank? You're the Mother!Figure it out! Don't do that, Ben. Don't do that. You can't let him down!You can't! Don't you think I know that? Damn you. (door slams) But if I have equity inmy house, why can't I use it? I realize it would reduce itto zero, but... No, that's not an option. My ex-husband wouldn'tqualify as a co-signer. Look, this isn'tfor a trip to Tahiti. My son needs an operation. Yes, I understand. Thanks anyway. Well, he's gotsome sensation. It's hard to tell,but I think there's some quadriceps,at least, on the left. (woman)Dr. Sandlin? I'm telling you, David,this is not a good idea. This child must be older. Look, this takes uphalf of his abdomen. (Dr. Decker)He's in a lot of pain and his spasticityis the worst I've seen. If we wait, he waits. (Dr. Sandlin)The implant isn'tour only option. He's too young, David. (Dr. Decker)It's okay, Georgie. Dr. Sandlin willcome around, I promise. Just rest now. (Dr. Decker)Anna. He's resting. (sighs) Um, Dr. Decker,this is, uh, Ben, Georgie's older brother. Hey, Ben. Georgie told mea lot about you. Did you get good marksin medical school? Uh, pretty good. How good? Finished fifthin my class. How many peoplein the class? More than five. What school did yougraduate from? Harvard. Is that a good school? Do they havegood reputation? Well, it's no DeVry Instituteof Technology or anything, but, um... Yeah, yeah, Ben,it's a good school. Do me a favor.Would you go keepGeorgie company? I wanna talk toyour mom for a minute. He's in 132,down the hall. (woman over PA)Dr. Hirschfeld, 2-3-1-4. Dr. Hirschfeld, 2-3-1-4. Uh, he's a--he's an intense young man. Ah, yeah, he's beena little uptight lately. New school, new house and...(pager beeping) ...he doesn't get enoughof my time I'm afraid. I'm...I am really sorry. I need to talk to you. Could you meet mein the lobby in ten minutes? Sure.Okay. (woman over PA)Dr. Guthrie, O-R two. Dr. Guthrie, O-R two. (sighs) Excuse me. I saw you talkingto Dr. Decker. He's the best. Dr. Decker, yeah,I've-- I've heard. I may not look like it, butI'm one of his latest miracles. (chuckles) My name's Denny Gabriel. Anna Lerner. He's treating my son,Georgie. Yeah, I know. Georgie and I hada great talk last week. He's a terrific kid. Well, thanks. Come on, sit down. Okay. You look worried. (sighs) You know, some--sometimes I'm just... not sure how muchmore I can do. How do you do it? How do I do it? I got a lot of support. The people around mekeep me going. Also, I know that one dayI'm gonna walk again. I'm gonnatell you something. Georgie's worriedabout you, too. About me? He's afraid that,deep down, you don't think he'sgonna get any better. He's afraid you'regonna give up on him. Oh, no... I willnever give up on him. See, Georgie'sstuck in a chair, and it makes himvery dependant on you. Sometimes he hates himself'cause he needs you so much. But he knowsyou love him. That gives him hope. But he's gotta remembersometimes that's all he's got. Right. You know... Uh, this procedure could go as highas $30,000. I'm not covered. I know. My office staff checked. I was hopingyou would have... other arrangements. It's notan approved operation, so they don't wantanything to do with it. Yeah.But don't worry. I'll get the money.I will somehow. (siren in distance) You don't know any dentistswho could do it, do you? We havegreat dental coverage. (chuckles) What were you likeas a child? Like this, only shorter. Any other questions,comments, editorials? I think you area remarkable mother. Oh, yeah... real remarkable. (whispers) Damn. I made a promiseto myself I wasn't gonna cryany more about this. It doesn't help. Maybe I can callthe insurance company. Maybe. And even if theydon't come through, I'll getthe money somehow. I'll do a duetalbum with Sinatra. As long as I don'thave to tour. (chuckling) (dog barks in distance) Hi.Hey, Miss Lerner,paper collecting. I'll pay you for this week, but from now just bring mepapers with good news. Yes, ma'am. (door creaks open)She's joking. Oh, I know. We women know whenwe're joking to each other. It's a gift. Is that your wheelchair? Yeah. Are you gonna be in itfor the rest of your life? Maybe... Maybe not. You'll never be ableto ride a bike. My wheelchair is sortof like a bike. Yeah, I guess. What are reading? Superman. I prefer Archie myself. Superman can fly. Archie hangs outwith Betty and Veronica. Do you wanna takea ride in my wagon? Sure. You might need tohelp me though. Great! Georgie! Unh! This gardenbetter be worth it. (grunting) This is like cement. (Ben)Georgie! Hey, Georgie! Mom!What? Where's Georgie?!Delivering papers. Wanna try the next one? Sure. Georgie! Georgie! What the helldo you think you're doing? We're deliveringpapers, Ben. You shouldn'tbe doing that. Ben, relax,I asked your mom. She said it'd be fine. Gets his mind offthe parachuting accident. Don't listen to my mother! I'm not finishedwith my route yet! He's going home! No, I'm not! You're going homeand that's it! It's my wagon! He's my brother! Ben, let go! You betterlet go or else! You said let go. I know what I said. You okay, Georgie? I can do things myself! You don't alwayshave to be around! I want to havefun too, you know! It's not fair! I want to belike other kids! It's not fair! I'm look-- I'm looking outfor you, you stupid moron. You're the stupid moron! He won't let me do anything. Look, Georgie,you're right. It's only papers. You can have fun too. We'll all do it. Is that okay, Terry? Sure. (players shouting) Kick it!Over here! Get it away! Got it! Over here! Somebody get the ball. Go get it. Hey, throw the ball back!Yeah, throw it. Throw the ballback, idiot! Look, I asked you topass me the ball, spud boy. I didn't hear you. (boys laughing) Now... get me the ball. (boys)Whoa! Mistake. Big mistake. (boys shouting) How long's the suspension? A week. Did you start it?No. The principal doesn'tbelieve me, though. It's this jerk,Hastings. You sure you're all right? Compared to what Georgiefeels, it's nothing. Just becauseGeorgie's in pain, doesn't mean youhave to be, Ben. That doesn't help him. Nothing I can docan help him. We're not talkingabout Georgie. We're talkingabout you, Ben. No, it's not about me! I know Georgie'sbeen taking up a lotof my time lately, and it isn't fair thatyou and I haven't been able to spend time together, just you and melike we used to. But I'll make it upto you, I promise. There's nothingto make up. Look, can't wejust go home? Ben, Ben,isn't there anythingyou wanna talk about? You can tell meanything, you know. Ben, please,talk to me. I am talking to you! Look, don't worry about me.I'm fine, okay? Without insurance coverage there's no way we canperform this procedure. Well, she saysshe'll get the money. Um... could we do iton a payment plan? I don't know,10% down or something. Keep in mind there'salways the chance we might have to go back into adjust the probe, which would meana second operation. The cost'd double. She'd end upmortgaging her life. I still thinkthe Baclofen injections is the most sensibleapproach at this time. Which happens to becovered by her insurance. I won't accept that. Now this boy hasa real chance here. I'm not gonna letsome insurance company stop him fromgetting that chance. I mean, come on,is that why we wentto medical school, so we couldbecome lackeys to some insurancebureaucrats? David, do I sensesome kind of personalinvolvement here? I-- I-- I just metthe family. I have a feelingabout this. I mean, they haveput everythingon the line for this. Besides, this isa procedure that should befine-tuned for children. She is just gonnahave to face the facts. Remember the last timewe gave a patient a break? We ended upwith a $50,000 bill. And even he went after uswith a malpractice suit. You're a hellof a doctor, but you'regonna have to do more to convince methat this procedureshould be performed on a patient so youngwith no insurance. I need morethan just a hunch. I'll get it! (door closes) (Georgie grunts) You like this, honey? Yeah. Georgie, you okay? Yeah. You wannago home, Georgie? No. I'm tiredof sitting at home. Hey, Ben. When was the last timeyou had your teeth cleaned? Funny, Mom. Ohh...(clattering) Excuse me! Anna! David, hi. Hi. Hey, Georgie. Hi, Dr. Decker. How you doing, hmm,? Hi, Ben. Should a doctordress like that? Well, when I'm ridingmy bike. It cuts downon wind resistance. Actually, it's,uh, it's new. Listen, I checkedthe listingfor medical schools in the library, and therewas no DeVry Institute. I think that wasjust a joke, Ben. (man #1)Hey, Dave, come on! (man #2)Hey, Dave,let's go, man! Yeah, look, we meet againand I have to run, so... Um, maybe, we could havean impromptu picnic sometime. Yeah, maybe. Dave, come on, you'reholding up the club. Come over for dinner...tomorrow. Uh... yeah, sure. We'll have a picnicat our place. Why not? Great! Okay. I'll-- I'll see youtomorrow... about 7:00? Great. Okay, bye. (Ben)See you tomorrow. Ben, have you lostyour mind? Mom, we have to beon his good side. He's a doctor. He's sort ofimportant to us. And you wantto risk his lifewith my cooking? A picnic.We'll have sandwiches. (sighs)You... (Ben)This garden is hopeless. (Anna)Wait till you guys seethe corn and tomatoes we get. Hello! Hi.Hi. Thank you. Uh, is it 7:00 already? Oh, no, no, no, I'm, uh,,I'm a little early. I wanted to catch youbefore you started dinner. I thought, uh, maybewe could just go... grab a pizzaor something. Well... I have toget cleaned up. Uh, I'll tell you what. Why don't, um, why don'tyou let us guys, uh, get the pizza while youget cleaned up, and, um... I could, uh,pick up something to, uh, help youwith the garden. (chuckles)Okay. Okay.Okay? Yeah? You guys wanna, uh,meet me by the car? I just wannatalk to your momfor a minute. Uh, go-- go ahead, guys. Is there--is there a problem? Well, I talked toyour insurance company and, um,it didn't help. I'm sorry. They get tougherevery year. Tell me somethingI don't know. Now, I'm not sure howyou're gonna take this, but I've gotanother suggestion. Don't try to talkme out of it. No, no, no, no,not at all. What I want isto publish a paper on the implant procedure and do a follow-up studyon Georgie. Now, if yougive me permission... the hospital willput up the money. We coulddo it next week. You would do that? Well, you would behelping me out and we would behelping others, and... It's-- it's nota charity thing if that's whatyou're thinking. (Anna)We got it!Yes. Georgie! Ben! Whoo! Did she goto Harvard too? I believe Dr. Sandlinattended Yale. Is that a betterschool than Harvard? You care about your brothera lot, don't you? You're gonnahave to trust me. Can you do that? (grunting)These are heavy. Use those muscles. (both grunting) You guys must reallylike vegetables. Not really. (Georgie)Definitely not. Got it?Yeah. That's it! You got it? Okay, good job. Nice job, buddy.Thanks. (David)Looks good. Come and get it! Here. Thanks, Georgie. Guess what, Mom?What? Dr. Decker likesTom Jones music. (coughing)You do? Uh, uh, you know,among other things. Growing up,that's all I heard. Three years aftermy father died, my mother went toa Tom Jones concert. He kissed her. Ever since then,she's played his recordsevery day, all day. I know every song.Every song? Every song.Everysong? All right, here. Um...how about this. ♪ Daughter of darknessstay out of my life, my life ♪ Whoa! Yes! Very good, okay, okay,how about, uh... (tapping out rhythm) ♪ Hair of goldand lips like cherries ♪ ♪ It's good totouch the green,green grass of home ♪ (boys applauding)I got one! (tapping) ♪ What's new, pussycat? ♪ ♪ Whoa-whoa-whoa ♪ ♪ What's new, pussycat? ♪ ♪ Whoa-whoa-whoa... ♪ (crickets chirping) (boys)Good night! (clears throat) Cheers. David, I don't want toask this question,but I have to. Don't ask it. I'm not usedto things going my way. It makes me nervous,like a bigger bombis gonna drop. You know how long it's beensince I've just sat out on a night like this andjust looked at the stars? How long? Years, years. I-- I can't even remember. I mean, look at 'em! They're beautiful. David, why areyou doing it? (exhales) I don't know. I feel like I've justcome out of a daze. Y-- You give off the mostincredible energy. I felt it the first timeyou were in my office. I don't-- I don't knowhow to describe it. Being a doctor, it forces you toseparate your feelings. They call itprofessional demeanor. (chuckles) It protects you,it protects the patient. The only problem is,it also makes you... numb. Imagine not being ableto taste your food, taste the wine. I don't want tofeel protected. I don't want to be numb. I owe you, Anna. I wanna be around you. David, listen to me. I'm a waitress. Part-timeflight reservationist. I got two kids,one in a wheelchair. You're a single guy,a very successful doctor who gets a kickout of riding your bike dressed like a Martian. Don't you think you'regetting carried away? You're just...burned-out or something. I know how I feel. Maybe I shouldjust, uh, I should go. I-- I don't want toseem pushy. Um... I should go now. I'll... I'll callyou tomorrow. Yeah.Yeah. Why don't you do that? Is Dr. Sandlina good doctor? She's an expert. And you don't getto be an expert unless you dothings expertly. Should I be scared?No way. This time by next week,you're gonna be pain-free. It's gonna go really well. What if it doesn't? Georgie...it's gonna go okay. You gotta think positive. I am thinking positive. But what if itdoesn't go okay? You're not gonna wannastay around me forever. I'll just get worse. No one will wantto be with me. Georgie, I wouldnever leave you. You're my brother. I'm not going anywhere,ever, ever, ever. Don't worry, it'll work. I can tell.I'm positive. So don't worry. Okay? Okay. Good night. (Ben)Heads, operation'sa success. Tails, failure. (coin clinks) Heads, operation's success.Tails, failure. Yeah. Heads, operation success.Tails, failure. Tails. Heads, operation success. Tails, failure. No. Heads, operation success. Tails, failure. (sobbing) (twigs snapping) (Ben gasps) (distant bird cawing) Soda? My friends say you'veburied over ten people alive. (chuckles) Who's this for? A woman. What happened? She killed herself. How come? Too sad to live, I guess. Her baby died for no reason about six months ago. She blamed herself. Lost the meaningto her life. Why did the baby die? Things happen for a reason. We just haven'tfigured it all out yet. Do you believe in luck? Well, now, the answerto that question, my friend, lies in anotherpart of the cemetery. This was the man who worked herebefore me. Years and years ago, he had a wifeand a young son and he wascalled off to war. He fought,served his country. And then one day,his unit got surrounded. No way out. And a bullet glanced offthat dog tag and saved his life. You can see whereit's dented right there. That man was my father. And he believed that every daythat he lived after that day was a bonus, a lucky day. And he wanted that dog tag left in full viewafter he died hoping thatif someone saw it, it would inspire them or bring 'em luck. Does it? I swearon my father's grave. (Anna)Bye-bye, see you later! (Georgie)Bye, Mom! (engine starts) I want you to gofor a walk with me. What's the matter? We gotta go somewhere. Where? (thunder rumbling) Ben, it's gonna storm! It's okay, we gottado this, Georgie! (Anna)Orlando? You sure you wanna gothere this time of year? It's-- it's humid. Not that I'm telling youwhat to do, but if it was me, I'd much ratherhit the mountains. (loud thunderclap) There go the computers. Early night tonight. Ben, what arewe doing here? It's gonna be worth it!Wait, you'll see! Ben! Tell me, please!My back hurts. Come on, Georgie,we're almost there. It's over thereby the river! There it is! What?Dog tags! Touch the dog tags! Come on, George,you gotta do this! I can't! Come on, George,you gotta touch them!

Take my hand! I can't reach it! Take it! Ben! No! I'm slipping, Georgie! Let me go, let me go! No! Let me go! You'll drown! I won't take you with me! (boys whimpering) Are you all right? (Ben)Yeah, help my brother. Was it possible their fathercame by and took them? I don't know,it's possible. But we're wasting time. Can't you startchecking on 'em? Did they havea favorite hangout that theymight've gone to? The newspaper girl. What's her number? What's her number?What's the number? Ben! I think the boy's hurt.Lay him on the couch. (Anna)Georgie, honey, I'm here. Can you talk to me? It's Mama, talk to me.Georgie? What happened? I want you squeezemy fingers. Squeeze my fingers,can you do that? Spread your fingers.Give me five? I'll be right back.I gotta make a call. (Georgie)Mom? (Anna)I'm here.I'm right here, baby. Ben, what did you thinkyou were doing? I was justtrying to help. Help?You call that help? Taking him out in a storm?How could that help? I'm sorry. Ben, I don'tunderstand you! What were youtrying to prove? Look, you wouldn'tunderstand. Well, you better try me. I said I was sorry! Ben, I want to knowwhat's going on and I want to know now. Do you hear me? I hear you. Well?! At least I'm tryingto do something! All you do is jokearound all the time! I care! How dare you! I care more thanyou'll ever know. Yeah? Well, you suredon't act like it. So it'd be betterif I moped around like you? You act like you're the onewho got hurt, not Georgie. I hate you! Yeah? Well, right now, I'm not too thrilledwith you either. And I'm not joking. I just talkedto Dr. Sandlin. I think Georgie has increasedswelling in his spinal cord. We need to operate now. They're waiting for usin surgery and we havean ambulance on the way. Okay? (staff shouting orders) (woman)Ready on three. One, two, three. Let's get thisout of here now. (overlapping orders) (woman over PA)Dr. Schaff to ICU. Dr. Schaff to ICU. Anna? How's he doing?Is he okay? The implant is in. The fracture sitelooks okay. There's no additionalnerve damage, so the drug therapyhas contained that. And we'll just haveto wait and see if the implantalleviates his pain. Can I do anything? I don't know why youdid what you did, Ben, but I believe you weretrying to help, Georgie. I think we shouldlet him rest. He's gonna be outfor about eight hours. We'll wait here. Oh, no-no-no,I think you shouldgo home and rest. I'll be here for him. Oh, you've doneso much already. Hey, let me do this. So how'd it go? Is he gonnabe all right? He's sleeping. He's gonna be great. Don't worry about it.I'm not worried about it. You know what, Ben? They shut the schooldown today. The lightning blew upa transformer or something. No electricity. Let's go downto the river. I don't think so. Ben, go on. It'll take your mindoff all this. Go on. (Perry)Would you lookat that canoe. (Lawrence)What a storm.

Uh-oh,tornado approaching. Let's see you get outof this one, girls. (boy)Yeah!(wolf whistle) You boys about to geta old-fashioned ass-kicking. And then we're gonna pee all over you.
