- You always say we used to be more like this and that or do this and that, especially about sex. You focus so much on it. - No. You were so horny in the beginning. I never had so much sex in my life. Honestly, I was just constantly tired and, yet, I always wanted to be with you again. So we would go to bed at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning and then get up at 7:00, like it never happened. - How did I look when you first saw me? - Like a banana, with a flower on top. - What did you think of me? - I thought I was already in love with you before I ever met you, before I ever saw you. - Did you think you would end up with me? - Yeah, actually. I felt like we were meant to be. It could all just happen really naturally and I felt like we knew each other already. - I also felt that. I just saw you and puff, in that moment I didn't care about my boyfriend or any other guy... - no. No. It was like a... like some kind of power was pulling us together, right? I don't think we could've done anything to resist it. - It was like a cosmic power. - Yeah, or like an energetic field. It was like time travel or just.. - Yeah. Or like the explosion of a star. - Yeah. Plasma. And just sparks surrounding us and we're glowing and we're becoming light and.. - And then we fuse together. - All this energy and all that's us and the future and the past and the present or the not-present, just.. - It felt so good. - Yeah. I loved that feeling. - Do you still see the sparks in me? - Do you? - Well, what do you think? - I love it. You? - I, I li.. It's great. I like it. - You don't like it? - No, I like it. I do. I really do. - You do? - I do. I love it. It's great. I'm gonna.. - You can use one of these rooms for your writing space get all inspired. - I think we should do it. - Have you seen the playground? It's so cute. Come. - I guess my only question is do we wanna live all the way out here or stay east? - This is a much better area, you know? Yeah, you got everything you could possibly want here. There's a supermarket down two blocks away. There's a Starbucks around the corner. - Yeah. No... - There's two Starbucks. - Dianne.. - You can each go to one. - I'm just saying, this is a little far from work for you, and downtown. - It's not that far. The 10 and the 405 are right here. - Yeah, I know. I get that. But I'm just saying, we should think about this a little bit. This is a major life change. The... the apartment's incredible. - Stop being negative. - I'm not being negative. - Well, you decide. - We just wanted to give you an option in case you... - no, thank you. It's great. The apartment's great. We just need to take a minute to talk about it. - I just don't want someone else to take it, you know? - Well, do you wanna buy it right now? I just, I, I never saw myself living in one of these like, stark, minimalist, boring modern apartments. - You don't have to be afraid of not looking bohemian. - No, it's not about looking it's about philosophy, it's about.. I don't wanna buy an apartment because we think that it's, it's the right time or because we're afraid of not being a serious couple. - Well, do you really wanna live like this for the rest of your life? - No. No. This is not.. No, no. This goes away. What? - It's prickly. Oh, what? - Nothing. - Wha.. I didn't say no. - No, but you didn't.. You're not excited. - What do you want me to do, clap? Yay! Oh, come on. I'm sorry. Let's kiss. - Hey. Hey. Come on. The moment's passed. Watch your show. - Okay. - What? It's not that bad. - Oh, come on, it totally is. The kitchen is falling apart. It's just not nice. - Guys, last time. - Okay, the kitchen is true but he usually fixes whatever we tell him to. - But it's such bullshit. You know, your house always has that weird, that, like it's got a, like a stink to it. There's a million stray cats around a hoarder neighbor.. Thank you a hoarder neighbor who dumps his piss on the lawn. - You know what, that's not true. It doesn't stink. - What dealers? - Guys, hey! - Hey, dad, last time I was over there someone had left a shit right at the.. I'm sorry, mom, there's no other way to say it. At the front door. - That was two years ago, what she's saying. - It happened like, one time, ever. - One too many, right, for a human shit? - Guys, I'm just saying, you don't wanna be with a baby and be around all of this cat and dog and human shit. - What baby? The one we don't have? - Look, we're not saying we don't wanna buy something. We... we're just thinking maybe we should stay where we are a little bit longer until we're more ready. - What's the down payment for a place like that? A hundred? Two hundred? - Maybe. - Two and a half? And even if it's three, and I guarantee you, it's not three but if it's three, I'll front the money and you can arrange it all yourself - no. - Just look at another place. I'll come with you. I'll-I'll look at it too. - Listen, if this is about not taking George's money which I totally get, that's fine. Uh, it's a super-easy time to get a loan right now. Super-easy. - Oh, honey, come on. They're like the typical unmarried couple. They're like, "hey, it's awesome. I'm free!" The thing is is you guys are already married. Come on, you don't need us to tell you this. No, I know.. But all, all we're trying to say... - Henry. You're married. - Every time I see them I walk away feeling like a fuck-up. It's like they want us to be these these little fucking puppets, you know? - Kids! Kids! Kids! - Kids! Kids! Kids! - Kids! Kids! Kids! - Everything worth.. Do everything exactly like us. Be us. - You have to have money and be boring. But kids, kids, kids! - It's not about us being happy. Or... or making it or whatever. I... it's about us living the way they want us to live. Do you think I should be providing for you more you know, like, be more manly have a bunch of money in my bank account take you on expensive trips? Because I... I would. I... I.. That's.. You know. - I think we're normal. I don't think so. I.. I mean, fuck them. - Fuck them. - We're doing great. - I think we should just buy the fuckin' apartment. I mean, I don't care if it makes us wannabe middle class drones or fuckin' whatever. Who.. Nobody.. Who fucking cares? - Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day it's just a fucking thing, you know? It's a fucking object. - Yeah, no, but it's a.. It's more than that. It's.. It marries us. It basically marries us. For me, that kind of a thing is more of a marriage than a fuckin' piece of paper. I mean, what happens, you... You... you buy an apartment and then, and then what? And then you're like, "let's have a kid." "Let's have two kids," and then you fuckin' blah blah blah and it's like.. Anyway, let's just buy the fuckin' thing. - I mean, should we just get married and get the fucking thing out of the way? It's not that big of a deal. It's not important. - Fuck it. - Fuck it? I mean, fuck it! I feel if we don't, then we're just stuck. Afraid of everything. Fuck it. Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Fuck it. Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife! - Husband and wife! - Husband and wife-e-e! - Wif-e-e-e! - Husband and wife! - Husband and wife! - Husband and wife! - Husband and wife! - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - I want a car. - Husband and wife. - And to eat in restaurants. - Husband and wife. - And a guitar. - Husband and wife. Husband and wife. And a Jaguar. - And a Jaguar! - A nice, really nice car. And lots of little kids. Maybe even twins. Oh, my god. Husband and wife! Husband and wife! - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Husband and wife. - Aah! Fuck. - Oh, god, it's hot. - Are we getting married? - Wow. - We have 200 VIP's confirmed. And over five hundred yeses on social media so we're in a pretty good spot. - Hmm. - So, what... what do ya think? - I think it's big. - Does it feel like the right spot or... - I think you'd have to tell me what you wanna do here. - Uh, Dianne will.. Can you explain? - Yeah. Yes. Um, so, the overall idea is to give a taste here of the endless possibilities of your platform. So, through what we call an immersive experience they, our guests, will be able to experience um, a... a motorcycle trip through the back roads of Morocco. Or, the cockpit of an f-16 while it's flying through the air. Or the depths of the ocean in a deep sea explorer. Basically, living any life they can live through your platform. So, projections on each wall, ceiling and floor. Right? An immersive experience. People will be standing here kind of like, uh, 1984 style, but cool. And in the end, it becomes this whole amazing collage of real things and virtual things and art and objects and taste, all in one experience. And then, when it's all over, after the sensory overload it'll be pitch-black everyone will be standing here like "what's going on? What's going on?" And then, floating in the center of the room - Hm. That's it? - That's it. - I think it's good. I like it. - Okay. - I like it. - You wanna be beautiful but respected as a woman. And then you... you wanna be sexy and skinny but smart and desired and rich, and eventually a mother and it's.. Maybe you just want too much. I don't think it's a terrible sin to wanna just stare at the ceiling and think for a day. I don't... I don't wanna live my life stressing about achievements. That's why I wasn't a lawyer or an accountant. I'm just.. I'm happy with the life that I have. Although sometimes when we go into a restaurant I, I feel like people think that I work for you. And that you're too good for me. - It's just one of those films that every single time you see it, it gets better and better and you get a little bit more out of it. I mean, first time for them but, uh, it's just such an edgy, nice way to close our series on love and memory. So, thank you very much for coming all the way out here. No, thank you for... - Uh, let's hear it for Henry. - Thank you. - Um, alright I wanna open it up now for questions from the audience. Uh, we have a few minutes, so shoot. Sure you guys are brimming with curiosity so, uh, let's get it out there. I me.. I, I love it. I mean, it's so raw and honest to the relationships and couples. It... it almost makes you cringe at how much you can see yourself in it. I have to confess, when I first saw it a couple, uh, years ago I was with my girlfriend and we were so uncomfortable watching it. I mean, she was elbowing me the entire time. It's... it's those little moments that we have all been through, you know? - Yeah. Yeah. - Um, yeah. Um, so, are you, are you working on anything new? Any new projects? - Uh, actually, yeah. I'm, uh, I'm writing, or trying to write something new right now. - Awesome. Is it about relationships? - Well, it's, um, sort of a metaphysical examination of sci.. Of, uh, time travel. - Time travel? - Yes, it's a Sci-Fi movie. - Sci-Fi? Wow. - Yeah. Yeah. - Well we can, uh, definitely get into that. Um, if you have questions about his film, about sci.. Oh, we can talk about Sci-Fi in general. It doesn't really matter. - Or, we don't have to talk about anything - actually, I do have a question. - Yes. Yes, you, right there in the blue. What is your question? - Why the music choice? - Uh, what do you mean? - The movie is so focused, it's almost claustrophobic and I just, I feel that good music would add rather than take away from that. Your choice of having no real music, it's just it's a bit redundant for me. - Well, um, I, I don't know. I, I don't think it was necessarily a statement against sound tracking or scoring or anything like that. I just didn't feel like music would elevate the narrative. And besides mu... music is.. It's expensive. It costs money. - Well, I... I feel that that's what separates the amateurish from the.. And don't take this the wrong way but from the truly-committed artist, is to not think small. Small little music, small little casts, small locations and especially in a city like la where you can find so many cool bands who'd be willing to give or even compose songs for your film. - I, uh, I, I hear you. I, I understand what you're saying. I just.. I don't know that I, I agree. Um, I just.. I don't know. I don't think it's that I'm being small-minded. I, I.. Well, I don't wanna sound like I'm being defensive or anything. - Don't get me wrong. I love your movie. Um, I just.. I mean, um.. No, no, no, never mind, I'm sorry. - No problems. There's no such thing as a bad question. That was wonderful. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, everyone, for coming. Let's hear it for Henry, okay? - Thank you, everybody. - Awesome. - Thank you, guys. - Thank you so much. - Yeah, I'll let you know when, when the next one happens. Thanks for coming. - Hey, I'm sorry. I really love your movie. I just.. I'm in music and I just get far too passionate. - Oh, no, no, don't worry about it. It's fine. - I love it when the guy tries to trick her into fucking her in the ass, it's hilarious. And the scene where he's like bouncing in the room and he grabs the cushion, humping it, saying her name. I laughed so hard at that part. - I could, uh, I could send you some of my shorts or... - I've seen 'em. - Where? - On your website. - Oh, really? - Also, the way you shot it, was so meta. I mean, that was a little unexpected. - Yeah. That, it takes people out of it sometimes. - Oh, no, definitely, I mean, in the beginning I was like, "what the hell?" But then, you know I really thought it was genius - yeah. - No, no, no, I'm serious. I mean, I'm not shitting you. I wouldn't do that. - Well, thank you. That, uh, that's very kind. What, um, what would you've.. What music would you have used? - Oh, man, I mean there's, there's so many cool choices. I could show you some stuff. I could. - Yeah? That'd be great. Do... do you wanna hear the music? I... - right now? Yeah, sure, I'd love to. We're called oddity, but if... if you buy it on iTunes it's o-d.. - O-d-t. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. So you guys have like, albums and stuff. - You thought it was a garage band. - No, no, I just, you know, like you have a, you have a manager and like a label? - I mean, we're not Madonna, but you know. Here. Okay. - This is you? I like it. - Wait, check this one. Here, get closer to the speaker. - I like it. I like it. It's.. I like trip hop. - It's not trip hop. - Well, whatever you call it. - You base your whole life on the idea that things will work out in the end. I can't do that. My father is a chemist, my mother is a teacher. They never talked about god, they never told me to hope. I just had to do well in school and make my money. I do wanna be different, but I also wanna know that when I'm old I won't be starving in the streets. I admire people that do artistic things like you, I do. But I could never live like that. - Oh! Oh, great. Ow-ow-ow! Oh! Okay, okay, alright. No, no, no, no, no. Off. Off. What is that? - Uh, this girl who came to the screening invited me to a party to hear her band play. - Really? - Yeah. Guess she's a fan. - Well, isn't that cute? - What? - Nothing. - What? - Nothing. - Well, I can't help that I'm hugely famous. Goodnight to you, sir. - Let's see that. Let's see that again. - No. No! - Now come on, let me just look at it. - It's not there anymore. It's just blue. It's just a dark blue mark. - I don't know, it looked pretty numerical to me. - That's.. It's not gonna come off 'cause I had it tattooed this afternoon. I had a guy go in and tattoo over it. So it's there forever. - Pretty impressive. - You wanna call her? - You ever had a girl's number scrawled across your arm before? - Veronica? I'm just, just kidding. It's, it's Henry from, uh.. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How's it going? Great, great. Yeah, me too. Um, uh, listen I was just calling, uh because, I don't know.. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bailing.. - Oh, look at that ring. That is so fucking ugly. Who buys this shit? That one's not that bad, the more classic-looking one. But fairly ugly in general. - Do you wanna... wanna keep going? - Oh, look at that diamond. Hmm? Hmm? Hmm, hmm. Hmm? Ding. - Let's, let's go. - Shall we go ask? - About what? - Let's just see. - I'm sure it's like a million doll.. - Fifteen thousand. - No, it's not that expensive. - No, it's cheap. - What do you think? - It's good. - So do you finance this type of thing? - You pay 30%, and we can do 12, 18, or 24. - Hmm. What do you think? - Do you... do you want it? - How much is the 30%? - Three and a half. - Forty-five. - Forty-five. - Five.. It's $5000. - Hmm. Do you like it? - How many times are you gonna ask me? It's good, I said it's good. - Okay. Well, thank you. We know where to find it. Right, my love? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - I was just checking it out. I like diamonds. And I like rings too. No pressure. - It's just you say that stuff all the time. It's... it's annoying. It's like, do you really want a big diamond ring? Really? - Well I... I don't need it. I don't require it. But I thought that was a really pretty ring I, it's.. We're not that kind of couple, you know? We're not the, like, will-you-marry-me in smoke letters in the sky and like, getting down on a knee and all that bullshit. It's just, it feels lame. It's so, like, conformist. - Well, you don't have to get down on one knee. You can just hand it to me in the plastic bag, just like.. - I just.. It drives me fucking crazy that I feel like I'm always reaching for some material goal that's so far out of my reach just because we feel the need to be this this evolving, escalating couple. - Hey, I'm kidding. Okay? Really, I am. I don't give a shit about the ring. I don't. But don't make me feel bad for liking something just 'cause you can't afford it. That's stupid. - Why do you say that? That I can't afford it, like that's my goal, that's my thing. - What... whatever. You, us is what I meant. I'm kidding. Really. I don't want the ring. If I did, I wouldn't have a problem buying it for myself. I just like trying stuff on. - Oh, yeah. Okay. - I promise. I don't want anything. I, I hate materialism. I love communism. And Marx. It will work. I told you. It'll be fine. - Good. - You guys are killing me. I'm gonna have to give you some math lessons. - Right. - That's great. - Yes. - Alright. - Yes. Are you leaving? - Yeah. - Uh, I was wondering if you wanted to come with me to check the projectors, actually just to make sure that we're because we don't have a lot of time for back-and-for this so we should nail it down as soon as we can. But if you can't.. - No. No, no, no, absolutely, let's.. - I... it's... it's all the way in long beach though. - I can. It's really.. I have a car. It's... it's not a problem. - I'm sorry. Am I messing with your entire day now? - No, 100%, you're not. - It's just for efficiency. - Yes, let's go. - Okay. - Alright. - Okay, let's do it. It's good that we're doing this today. - Like those pants. - Oh. - Great pants. I love long beach. - Really? - Yeah. Uh, can't say I've spent a lot of time.. - Whoo! - Hey. - This guy is insane. - Again. - He's insane. - Yeah, yeah. - Whoo! - Yeah! - It's like a nightmare. But like, but like, cool. - The whole night was so Roman. Everything was in excess the food, the alcohol, the drugs. Everyone was like, making out and hooking up. - Uh, you're... you're like, participating in the or... orgy? - No. No, not last night. - I just, I didn't know that people still had orgies. It feels so like, '70s. - Yeah, they're kinda like the new thing. - And nobody, nobody, nobody cares about like, aids or gonorrhea or anything like that? - How long have you been with your wife? - My girlfriend? Uh.. I don't know, six ye... - why do you underplay that? - I don't. - I bet you'll make a great husband. - Why? - You seem mature and loyal like a good guy. Serious. But you're the kind of guy who probably always carries a condom with him and if you cheat, you will tell your wife that you are very, very, very sorry. - You make me feel like I'm a 50 year old. - Well. - I've done my share of crazy shit, you know. Really. - Come to the next one. We'll probably get in an orgy together - I don't even wanna tell you how much it was. I... I can't. - How much? - I can't. It's ridiculous. I'm embarrassed to tell you how much it cost to fix this car. - Come on. - I can't. I'm embarrassed. I would tell you, but it's... it's absurd. Let's just say it was worth it - okay. Let's say that. - You can drive it on the way back if you want. - Really? - Yeah. - I would love to drive it. - People ask me why don't I drive electric. Have you... have you seen them? I mean, who designs those, right? - I'm always afraid of realizing too late that I made the wrong choices a long time ago when I was like, 17. I... I was brought up around this middle-class mentality where my parents were terrified of things not working not, not being able to support the family or retire. It's ridiculous. I... I just wanna say fuck it and... and be this drunk artist or drug addict or this... this guy that's just fucking all these girls and.. No, but I don't think that's me either. I think I'm.. Maybe I'm just a boring guy. - Thank you for coming. - You've got to relax. You also have to have some fun. And what if your wife is like, into threesomes and orgies and wants to be fucked by a broom? I mean, who knows. And if you wanna do that stuff, then you should just ask. Or maybe you just wanna fuck around. And you should go and do that. You're young. - Are you gonna see this guy again? - I don't know, maybe. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, he's an okay guy. - Are you like going out with him? - You mean, are... are we going steady? Fuck no. He's not my boyfriend. I am free. - Okay. - I... I can, I can suck your dick right now if I want. Great feeling. - I.. You're very nice. I'm sure that you say that to all your teams to motivate them. - No, I'm dead... - And it works. - I'm dead serious. I promise, I've thoroughly enjoyed every second working with you. Yes. Yes. And you? - What? - Have you enjoyed working with me? - Yes. - See, I just like.. Don't you.. I just like being around you. That's.. I was gonna say something about your smile but I'm not, I'm not gonna say. - Um... Uh, I have a boyfriend. - Don't you think that there's something something between.. - Between us? I mean, you're very sweet, but.. - Like, you didn't need me that day at the projectors or to help you with the technical grid or any of this stuff. This is your job. This is what you're good at. When I'm with you, I, I feel that there's something.. And I could be completely delusional but... I think you're flirting with me. - No. - Really? - Yes. - Really? - I'm.. I don't know. I m.. I don't.. Maybe, but, but I... I'm sorry. I just wanna be professional - why? Why be professional? - Because I'm good at my job and I don't need to screw my clients. - Well, that's not what.. I mean.. You... you don't work at my company. - And you know what? I have a boyfriend. And we're very serious. I mean, we're, we're thinking about buying an apartment together. And we're practically engaged. So.. - No, it's... it's.. I get it. That's serious. That's.. That's very, um.. That's serious. - Do you still wanna work with me? - Of course. Of course. - Okay. Uh, you know, I'm very sorry if I am the one who caused any of this. - We'll keep it professional. - Okay. - I'm gonna run to the.. I'll be back. I'll be back. - Okay. - Hey! - Hey! - What's up with this music? You play it so loud. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - Excuse me, sir. Is it Glendale or Pasadena? - Uh, Pasadena, please. What time are they supposed to open? - I don't know. They're just in there standing around. I feel.. Are we underdressed? - Whatever. I, Dianne, take you, Henry.. - Henry. To be my husband my partner in life and my one true love. I will Cherish our union and love you more and more each day than I did the day before. - Continue. - "Loving you faithfully "through the good times and bad "regardless of the obstacles we may face together "I give you my hand, my heart "and my love from this day forward for as long as we both shall live." - Okay, what's so funny? Come on. You have to believe it when you say it, okay? Let's do the rings. - We don't have. - You didn't get a ring? - No ring. - You... you didn't buy her... - No. I'm sorry, no ring we didn't have time, and we wanted to do something simple and easy. Quick. Just us. - Just us. - Okay. What's the rush, guys? You know, it's supposed to be something beautiful. It's supposed to be flowers and rings and tears and music. I'm just messing with ya. By the power vested in me by the state of California I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride. - Look at this. Look, look, look, look. That's a real.. Oh, excuse me. Can you take a... - No, sorry. - Hold on one second. Excuse me. Will you.. Can you just take a picture of us with the building in the background? And then hold this. Did you get it? Awesome. - Okay. - Thank you so much. Okay. Right this way, my wife. I know! It's real. - It's so official - let's get like, a Martini or something. - Ooh. That's a good idea - is that okay? Can we day-drink? - Yeah, we can day-drink. - I'm in. - What's open now? - I'm a fucking monkey. I'm sorry. Hey, what? What? What is it? What? You all good? - I'm sorry. It's.. - No. No sorry. What? - I'm just sensitive. - What is it? What? What do you.. Do you... - I feel strange. - Do you feel like you fucked up? - I feel guilty. I feel like I'm supposed to feel. But I don't feel any different. - Hey. Hey. Do you feel bad? Do you feel... do you feel sad? I had like a.. I couldn't breathe. I had a knot right here. I was like.. - You did? - Yeah. But now I'm... I'm okay. I'm okay. We're okay. Right? I got my wife. - Oh, my god. - We should celebrate more. What do you wanna do? - Yeah. Where... Where should we go? What do you wanna do? - I don't know. What do you.. Um.. Or we could go home. - Okay. - Okay? Uh, will you just, will you just take us home? - Okay, you don't have to do this. - No. No no no. We're doing it! We're doing it! - Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. - Who-a-a-a! - No, no, no, no, stop. Okay, okay, stop. Okay, stop, stop, stop. You're hurting me. - Okay, no, we have to do this. We have to do this. No, stop! Oh, god! Oh, my god, what the fuck! - I'm sorry. - You don't listen or what? - Oh, come on. - You're so fucking stubborn. - What? - Hey. Let's, let it go, okay? Come on. It's our honeymoon. Hey, we should be celebrating. Hmm? Hmm. Ooh, ay-ay-ay. Let's.. - Hey, hey, come on, please. Just, just.. - Oh, I'm just joking. - I know. I know you're joking. That's, that's the problem. - What are you talking about? You're the one rejecting me. I'm rejecting? I'm.. Okay, here. Come on. - Really? What the fuck? You say I always reject you? Why would I reject you? You just, you have to be so fucking brutal? - It's only brutal because it's not on your time. You know, I.. You basically want me to be your gay best friend. And then when you're ready for it, when you think it's time then I have to be a fucking porn star, and I just have to step up and be your fuckin', your fuckin' dildo. Sit on my fuckin'.. I'm sorry. Wanna get a divorce? We can go right now. - I think it's crazy that we met all cool and casual and now we're gonna be together for the rest of our lives. We're gonna die together and.. I mean, this is it. If we just knew that when we met. Imagine in ten or twenty years will we still like each other? I mean, is there really a point? I know how this ends. You go and go and go forward doing what you have to do, until you die. It's boring. It's boring. Do we really want that? Who gives a shit if we buy an apartment or a stupid ring? Do we wanna be together? Do we really want the life that we can give each other? - It's really sad when you put it like that. I think for me the... the thing that really hurts is knowing that the happy and excited and crazy and horny and lively girl that you were when we met is still inside. I just can't have her anymore. If you, if you met a guy tomorrow you would just fuck everywhere and you wouldn't care if he had health insurance or if he could afford a juicer. You would just want him all the time. He'd be your, he'd be your top priority. That's what kills me. Someone else can have it, but not me.. Because I'm here. It fucks with me. - I think I.. I was acting like an idiot and my client thought that I was into him, and.. He kissed me. It was completely unexpected. Like, when I realized that he was there and then he just kissed me and then he left. It's not that we kissed. It was really, really unexpected like, boom, he just kissed me. But it made me realize that I wanted it.. In a way I did, because I was flirting and.. I just feel really, really guilty because I don't even like him. I don't know. I'm... I'm so sorry. - You must've, you must've liked him a little bit.. - No. I don't. He's.. Not at all. But there's ju.. There's all this weird energy and that's what I feel weird about because you know, I created that. Because I.. Crave... That feeling. - I'm trying. I'm fucking trying. I fucking.. God. - Don't punish me now. - I've been seeing this girl, the, um, fan. Remember? And I, I catch myself thinking, what would it be like if I just threw all of this away and ran off with her. And it gives me a rush. I get a rush thinking about that. I don't do it, but I get a rush thinking about it. - You are such a fucking hypocrite. You just made me feel like shit. And you're the one who's fucking a groupie or... - I said, I thought about it. I didn't say I did it. - Yeah, not yet. - Oh, believe me! Believe me, I could. - Oh, of course. - Believe me, I could've. - Of course! - Why are we talking about me? Why is this about me? You're the one who wants to go off and fuck your rich douchebag boss. In fact, you actually went for it. - No, I didn't. - Oh, sure. You know what? Yeah. He just came in, gave you a little peck on the lips and then you walked away. I am fucking sure something else happened. - Yeah, you think I, what, gave him a blowjob in his car or something? Is that what you think? - Did you? - Unbelievable. - Okay. - Where are you going? - Hi, this is Henry. I can't come.. - Robert. Robert. Good, and you? Good. Good. No, I was just.. No... no, sorry, go ahead. No, I was wondering if you weren't busy if you wanted to.. Hey, hey. - Hey, hey. - Thank you for coming. - Yes. You've gotta let me drive this thing. - You look great. This thing's, uh.. - Oh. - There it is. - Hi. - Oh, this is Nadia. - Hey. - I'm Dianne. - Nadia. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - So. - So. - How are things? - Good. - Oh, my god. Wait, wait. I love this song. - Hey! Could I... - with ice? - Excuse me. Please. - A little water, please. - Hello. Come on. - Vodka. - Hey, hold on, again. One thing. I'll be right there. - Could you please.. Excuse me, sir. Fuckin'... - Hey, dude, dude, got a beer? Sorry. - How 'bout a beer? - Oh, no, we don't have that. Order something else. - I'm really happy I came. - What else do you need? - Can I get a coke? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.. - What do you think of my friend, Jessie? - Uh, I.. She seems really cool. - Yeah, she needs a guy urgently. Excuse me. Hey! Stop, mainframe. Mainframe. Mainframe! Stop! Can.. Can you.. Aah! Goddamn it! Stop, processor. Stop, computer. Shit! Oh, god! I just wanna be.. I just wanna be human, you know? I just want.. I wanna be all human. Okay, no more machine. Can you.. Can you shut down? Can you, um.. Can you give me back my soul? Give me back my soul? Give me back my soul? - People like you never had a soul. Or a life or kids to feed or dogs to play. You've lived your life through parlor walls. And that's why you die like a virus. - There is a nirvana and I found it here. It's green and it pulsates. It's like a... Burst of happiness in my chest. With you, I found love. And I wish I could've stayed with you longer. Longer. Longer. Longer. Longer. - Okay, so the guy was who? The mainframe? - I think the guy was the soul of the machine and the machine was the man. - Really? So the guy was a machine? - I think that's the point of the whole thing. Machine versus human emotion kind of thing... - I think it doesn't matter, really. It just makes you feel, I think. You know? It's just supposed to be lyrical. For me, at least. - So you're into artsy-fartsy? - You.. What? What? - Well, no. I just mean is she an artist or does she just like groovy stuff? - Not... - Or what does she do? - I'm a designer... - Dianne's assisting me in the launch of dream further, so. - Oh. - You made it! - He made it. - Hey, buddy. - How are ya, pal? - Oh, you were so good. - Nice. Nice. What is that, calfskin? - Oh... - thanks, Nadia. - Up. - Oh, it's... - Or you're gonna get rug burn. - Oh, that was... It was, it was really, it was really great. - Thanks, Nadia. You liked it. - It was really great. - I'm glad you liked it. - Hi. I'm Dianne. - Hi, Dianne. This is Dianne. - Nice to meet you. - She's, uh, assisting me. - Yeah, she's doing a great job in the launch. - Oh, cool. - Right, oh, on the new... The new one or? - Uh, same thing. - Yeah, the speaker company. - Platform. - Right, the... the trips. Right? - Yes. That's the... - right. - Well, it's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Yeah. - Alright. Wow. It's like Star Trek. - Yeah. - Wow. - Wow, is this your new office? - This is it. Look at this. How does this.. Right. Come on. I don't know how that works. - Yeah? Let's go. - This place is.. - Yeah, it's great. - Right. - How about some wine, huh? - Tell him your name. What did you wanna call it? So funny. - The gourmentetures. - The what? - Gourmenturers. - I always say it wrong. - How do you say it? - Gourmenturers. - You say... - you can't even say your own idea right. - I know, it's... it's, it's like adventures. But it's the Gourmenturers. - Oh, I see that. No, I got it. It's a pun. I get it. - All I can say is, this woman right here is the best reviewer, bloggist, fashionist, stylist.. - No, stop. Stop. - Anything, anything you do... - no, you guys, that's good. You got something there. - Tell 'em what else you can do. - We're just spoiled, you know? I mean, we just like good stuff. Good food, good restaurants, good wine. - That's great. - Nadia, goodnight. No.. Oh, we can't talk about restaurants? - No, you can talk about restaurants, clearly. No, man, I... I gotta, I gotta rehearse tomorrow. I'm exhausted. Takes a lot outta you. - Are you headed east? - I can take you. - We can go to dinner. - That's okay. I don't wanna get in the way of this whole vibe. - Where do you live? - I'm in los Feliz. But if you pass the 10 or the 101, anywhere. - Oh, yeah, no, I know a great shoulder. - I could just.. I'll drop you off on the way. No, i... - actually, you know what? You don't even have to stop the car. - I'll just open the door and jump. - Just roll.. Just jump out. Yeah. Yeah. - Perfect. - It was so nice meeting you. - It was so nice meeting you too. - Thank you so much for everything. - What is your process like? At 6 A.M., I run around the reservoir for... I totally see that. - Couple of hours, and then just five hours of... No, I'm very lazy. - So how did you come up with the idea for this? - I don't know. - Okay. - It's like a.. Do you know what I mean? - Uh, what was that? - Yeah. Totally. No, I get that. - Like a fart that comes out of your your head. - Yes, yeah, exactly. - It's a brain fart. And then I subject the world to it. - I know, but it works. It's about all.. - I mean.. I hope that you don't feel interrogated by all these questions. - No. - I'm just genuinely curious. - No, I'm flattered that you would give a rat's ass. - I give more than a rat's ass. - I, okay, I appreciate that. - Are you working on anything new? - Yeah. Yeah. I wanna do a... a time travel piece a thing where people are sort of.. It's kind of hard to describe but popping up all over the stage traveling through, uh, time. - It sounds incredible. - Yeah? - Yeah. - So I should do it? - Definitely. - Would you see that play? - I would love to see that play. - Yeah? Well, maybe you can organize the production. - Of course. - Okay, well, great, it's a deal. - It's a binding contract, I think, in a Tesla in the state of California. I don't.. - No, that's really cool, actually. I mean, I would.. Just let me know if you.. You know, I have to admit, this is my first time in a Tesla. Yeah? Do you ever, um, do you ever let other people drive this car? - Like attractive brunettes who are like, what, 5'5", right? - Yeah. - You have this admiration for accomplished guys. I think you thought that I was that in the beginning. There's so many times where I... I imagine coming back to the house and finding you screwing this like, athletic, perfect guy and... and I would just grab my stuff and leave without even saying anything. Or maybe I would call you a whore and then you would chase me out of the house and I would leave the relationship like a martyr. You feel like shit and I'm free to do whatever I want. - Henry! Hey! Henry. Hey! - What? Hi. - Hi. How are you? - I'm good. I'm all good. - Do you need anything? - Like what? - Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political.. - What is that? - An oppressed class under the sway of feudal nobility. - Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! - An oppressed class under the sway of feudal nobility. Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was acc.. - Whoo! - Whoo! - An oppressed class under the sway of feudal nobility. Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding.. - Everything okay there? That looked like kind of an intense conversation. - Everything's fine. - Everything's fine. - I didn't know you were married. - Um, yeah, 15 years. - You do not look old enough to be married for 15 years. - Aw, shucks. I'm definitely old enough. And, um, we got married when I was pretty young, so.. - Do you have kids? - No. - Well, okay. - So, what about these guys. Are they making it into the book or... - no, you have to try these fries. - Yes. - They're fantastic. - The wonderful thing about our lives are we can get the most amazing fries. Oh, my god, Robert, what is going on? So what's your scene? I mean you... you have a boyfriend or.. - Um, I am also married. - What? Really? - I mean, I think I'm married. I may not be married. Fuck, I don't fuckin' know. - Wow. That sounds nuanced. What... - my boyfriend-husband um, just, uh, left the house and I don't know where he went and I don't know if he wants to come back. And, um.. He might be out with someone else. - Did you have a fight or.. - I don't.. So, I have to ask you, you've been married for 15 years. I mean, how do you keep it fun? - It's not fun. - Oh, how very inspiring. - Yeah. Well.. It's worth it, right? Um, you want another one of these guys or? - Yeah. - Yeah? - And now that I know you're married I could just get wasted. Hey, man, that doesn't make me any less dangerous. - Ooh! - Yeah. Know what I'm sayin'? - Whoo! - This, in forest thing.. - Uh-huh. - And then people kept, like, hunting him down because they heard of this legend and he grows the best weed in the back that you will ever see. - You're out there imagining your dick inside every woman running around like a horny dog. That's why you're never calm. I never see men as penises. I see them in the street and I imagine what life would be with them if it would be more exciting or fun or interesting and that's what turns me on and then I think about having sex with them. Strange, but that's always how I end up being attracted to someone. I can't control it. - Oh, my god. - Could you tell how much I loved that? - Yeah. I can. - I was afraid it was gonna be really sloppy and slow, but it's not. - No. No, the thing's bad-ass. I don't do sloppy and slow. You wanna get another drink? - Where, at this hour? - Uh, yeah, I don't know. Uh, do you have anything at... at your place? - Mm. I'm worried that if we go back to my house that I'm gonna do something that I regret because my relationship is... is in a bad place and you're married. And I'm sure that your wife would not appreciate and I just don't wanna fuck up someone else's life just because my life is fucked up. - I promise you you're not gonna fuck up somebody else's life by having a beer. Come on, it's just two grown men having a drink. - Yeah. Yeah. - Hey. Hey. Fuck these people. Let's go back to my place. Just you and me.. Naked in the warm pool. - Okay. - Jessie, come back to my place. We're all gonna get naked in the pool. Bring this gentleman. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Oh, come on. I promised this guy here an orgy. Come on, Jessie. Come on. Come on. Jessie! This fucking music. - Music! - It's fucking coming! - Where's the music! - Let's get outta here. Anyone wanna come back to my place? I am arranging a crazy sex party for this guy. Anybody. - I think I only have gin. - Only gin? - Yeah. - So specific. - You have tonic? - What? Mixers are for pussies. - Okay, alright. - Okay? - Okay, I'm a man. - No, I'm just kidding. - No, I'm a man. > I might have tonic. - Okay. - Maybe. Baby. Maybe, baby. Uh, maybe baby babe.. You can cum inside me. - I don't wanna, I don't wanna come yet. - Ozzie. Shut up. - Are you on, like, you know, the pill or whatever? - Yeah. - And you're pretty, you know, diligent about it. - It's fine. I've been on it for ages. - Okay. - Trust me. - But do you want me to stick a toothbrush up there? - No. - No, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Don't worry. - I'm... I'm not gonna chase you. Trust me, it's completely fine if we never see each other again. I don't want a little Liam. - Hey, I... I, uh, I would like to see you again. I mean, it's not about sex or whatever... - for what, then? - For what? I.. I don't know, I mean, as friends, or, I guess. - I don't think we could ever be friends. You know what I mean. - Right. I'm getting, I'm getting divorced anyway. - What? - It's not about you. I'm just getting divorced. - Why are you telling me this? I don't give a shit. - What? Hey. Hey! I didn't force you. You drove us here. I'm telling you that because I, because I like you. You know, I mean, I.. I thought we had, uh, like, a nice time or whatever. I know, I... I don't know you very well. I just figured I'd tell the fucking truth for once. I just, I thought.. - Henry. - You know, I thought maybe we could, I don't know... - Henry, Henry, Henry. - You know, I thought maybe we could.. I don't know. Dianne? Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Relax, okay? I'm sorry, alright? I'm sorry. She said you guys were done. Hey. Get the fuck down. Stay down. Stay the fuck down! Fuck this. - I just came by to get some stuff. God! I feel like I wanna slap you or hurt you, somehow. - You can if you want. You feel better? Fuck you! - Okay. - I hate you! - I know. Me too. Me too. - Let go! - S... stop it. Alright. - I hate you. - Me too. - I hate you. - Me too. Okay. - I hate you. - Me too. - I hate you.
