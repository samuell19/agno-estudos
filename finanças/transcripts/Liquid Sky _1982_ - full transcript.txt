Hey, I need some stuff. You got any money babe ? No but I'll get some tomorrow. But I don't wanna think about tomorrow, you had for me tonight remember ? -Hey listen... -No. Let's go to your place. Right now, with you ? Sure. Ok, let's go. You know where she keeps the stuff ? Don't ever ask me about that. I don't usually fuck girls. That's Ok I prefer girls to men anyway. You think we can find it ? Find what ? We could take just a little. She wouldn't know. Adrian would know. Besides... I don't know where it is. Yes, you do... Fuck you! Cut it out! That's enough I think you should leave. If you want to go to the club and ask Dave, you'll go ask her. Are you gonna take a cab? Fuck yourself. Margaret ? You have to get back to the club. Adrian will have finished singing and we'll still have to make up for the fashion show. Open the door. I wanna get me backed and dressed. OK. Margaret ? Accompany me to the club. So it's all set Margaret we'll come over tomorrow night. Janet was supposed to be in here. Your roof is great. And you're even better. Jimmy ! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow night. I don't know. Come on, we'll have a great time and get some terrific shots. There's a chance to get them published in Midnight Magazine. What kind of drugs we have ? The thing you want. Allright. Liquid sky... Key to heaven... Paradise That's what they used to call. But I don't want you to do it anymore. It's dangerous. So...see you tomorrow at Margaret's roof. And don't stay out all night I want you looking fresh for the shoot. You want to look bad ? I said yes. People have been using opiates for centuries. Ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, India, China Everybody used them nobody thought it was destructive or dangerous They didn't think it was immoral to feel euphoric. Are you gonna come to my roof tomorrow night ? I'll decide that tomorrow night. All right listen to me everyboby. Listen up ! Get it restless, let's start the show. In this country at the turn of the century, you could buy a heroin derivative in any drugstore to cure your ill's housewives. They loved these and used for everything like aspirin. Everybody wants euphoria. What's wrong with that ? I'm not a housewife at the turn of the century and I do not want heroin in my house. It's not just for pleasure... I use it to open my blocked creativity, Cocteau wrote great litterature while high on opium. Cocteau was Cocteau before he ever did drugs. What's that supposed to mean ? That it's not gonna help you. You bitch. Help me out won't you ? You always have to throw your success in my face. If you wanna help me... hold this for me. Hold this. Please ! Paul...I did it because I love you. You want some stuff ? What do you think ? You have my money yet ? No but we'll get some, I could pay you tomorrow. No money no stuff babe. I'll have it tomorrow. Talk to me tomorrow. You'll give me the stuff or I'll rat on you. He smashed up the place looking for it. He's not going to get any stuff tomorrow either. I'm not nice. Hey, Marv and you should snort some scagg. Actually, I'd rather have cocaine. I hate you, ugly chick. There's some guy on the dance floor offering cocaine to all the chicks. Why don't you ask him ? Hi you... Nice chick, want snort some blow ? Sure. Well, I don't wanna do it here. Will go to my place it's not far. Where's the cocaine ? Did you ever do Quaaludes before ? I've done more Quaaludes than you have aspirin. They don't excite me. These are "lemons"...you can't get them all the time. Listen if I wanna dance I can shoot heroin any time I want. Where's the cocaine ? Why don't you just take these ? Now ! Because I don't want them. What are you gonna do ? Throw them down my throat or something ? You're a model right ? Right. Where's the cocaine ? I do soaps... Do you have ever seen me ? I don't watch soaps. My father works for MGM. He gets me jobs. My father... ...could help you. What do you say, your daddy his gonna help me break into show business ? That's the corniest line I've ever heard. My father will get you a job as an actress. You're pretty enough ? He'll do it if I ask him. You should be nice to me. You just want to get laid. You'll say anything to get laid. Like every one else from California. What do you have a cock for a brain baby ? Don't fuck with me you asshole. Why don't you go fuck your father, he loves you so much. Swallow it ! Swallow it ! Swallow ! Come on swallow. Swallow it ! What's that supposed to do ? Make me fall apart and spread my legs. Takes more than two Quaaludes to do that baby. Why don't you go home to your mama ? You fucking horse. Swallow it ! Swallow, just swallow that. Swallow it ! Son of a bitch. Bitch. Want more ? Would you give me my flask ? You wanna drink ? Yeah, please. -Want a drink ? -Yeah All right. All right. Is that better ? I want my vision to be blurred so I don't have to look at your face. Shit ! What I want you to do, turn around...go over there and stay put. Who are you? I live here. Are you her girlfriend? What difference does it make? Just curious. You like girls better than boys? I'm always curious about who love to make those sexual definitions. What do you mean? Homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual. Whether or not I like someone doesn't depend on what kind of genitals they have. As long as I find them attractive, don't you think? See I don't want to fuck a man, Okay, it's your business. So you like both man and women. What difference does it make to you? You're a junkie. Can't get it up anyway. How do you know? Live her alone. Live me alone. Don't worry it's a good count. I don't have any works can I use yours and do it now. I don't wanna watch him. I wasn't talking to you. Your girlfriend, she's very pretty. She's a bitch. Margaret... ...is an uptight Wasp cunt from Connecticut. Can I use your works? Yeah, It's allright. But give me an extra four hours. Sure. Do me a favor... Can't get around to get off. Relax baby. -Takes a lot. -You should be happy. Paul give us some money we can go take a lunch. So what? Get ready to go. It gets this bitch two hours to get ready to go out somewhere. In the beginning aliens were spotted in places with large amounts of heroin. Later, aliens appeared in specific sub cultures, punk cultures. Still around heroin and in these punk cultures many more strange deaths have occured. Big fucking belly, eat your food! Apple pie, shit! Why don't you ask something to eat some cheese some...and taste some wine... Nothing strange about deaths in punk culture. They kill each other by shooting too much dope. I remember when we were... in Cambridge there was war I think between the Mods and Rockers. They went on each other with bicycle chains. I don't think your punks need help from the outside to kill themselves. My mother used to bake five or six apple pies at once. Apple pie... She put them in the porch to cool. We had an apple tree in the backyard. When coming from play and the porch would be filled with steam. We couldn't have any pie until after dinner. You were lucky baby she sounds like a real angel. Listen I happen to have a free evening tonight. I'd love you to come at my place I've done some changes. I'd love to know what you're doing. I'd love you for dinner. Well I have an appointment with a fashion photographer, I can't get out of it. Well I'm glad your carrer is going so well. The most interesting fact we found these killings occur during sexual intercourse. You don't know my mom was great, listen to this: One time she came out of the house for a ride. And she was OK she was cool she was great. So she went out with this guy, this really straight guy, they went to this really fancy restaurant. You know, best in town! Right? She was doing fine. And all of a sudden, man, she stood up on the balcony. She could be right up on the balcony man, and she pulled up her skirt and she looked at all the people and she said: I'm Jesus Christ, man. And I baptize you in the name of the son the father and the holly ghost and she pissed on every body. It must have gone in the fucking food and everything. Can you beat that? Shit... Then what happened? Then they threw her back in. Thank you. Get check, please. Remember the last time you were off at the studio? When was that? -Six months ago. -Right. Remember there were a lot of people there? Well, several people came up to me and said: Is that your brother? Of course you're my sister mom. I show you the documentation about progress. You mean you made slides of sexual intercourse? They're gorgeous you know. Hey mom, can I have some money? I have to be right, I'll send you a check allright? Allright. You take American Express? I really need it you know. Can I give you when I left uptown? No! I'm going down. It's not funny, we've not only located the UFO, but we've managed to photograph the creature inside of the craft. We did an attempt to classify his various emotions and states. May be I'll go to Berlin. They'll love me in Germany baby, I'll be a star. I'll buy cocaine. Saw a fax with beautiful names. C'mon will be great. You think it will be different there? Why would you have to fuck up your hair. Your hair look like shit. That's what Owen always says. Owen...I was supposed to meet Owen. I forgot. Where? Taking Owen to our place? Well, I didn't want to go there. I don't like Owen baby, I don't want to see Owen. What's your schedule like? I need your help. I cannot get to close because I'm a stranger in this country. There are some things which are difficult to study because of that. I watched the creature from the empire state building but at night it's closed. How can I study the behaviour of this creature? It's on a private property. I don't know...I'd like to help you, but I don't know what you expect me to do. I'm just a college acting teacher. Fuck see Owen, OK. I got business, I got things to do. See fucking Owen. Well, listen...I'd like to help you in some way but... I've an appointment right now, can we get in touch tomorrow? These aliens are killing people, you're the only person I know in New-York. Telephone me tomorrow, keep in touch OK? Almost everything you've done since you left me has been self destructive. Adrian is a real bad influence on you. She didn't care anything about you. She's only using you. You're ruining your carrer. Your future. What are you talking about? It's the only thing I care, about my carrer. What do you thing I'm doing right now? I'm getting ready to shoot with a fashion photographer I met at the club. Who's got to come here. He only wants to go to bed with you. Nobody, nobody fucks at the club, everybody's gay. It's you who thinks about fucking all the time. Your vocabulary is punctuated to two words "Shit" and "Fuck". What do you say I should say making love instead of fucking? So what do you think? Is that better professor? I think you look like a hooker. And you act like a hooker. You'll end up in a hospital with some horrible sexual disease. You don't understand, so I look like a hooker? So what? You like it...I know that you like it. So why should I live these lies? The way you want me to dress and behave is as a sweet housewife slave of her husband's will. A hooker at least is independant ...nobody's victim. It's the only fair that I warn them, this pussy has teeth. You're my best student. I invested a lot of time in you. What do you say? We've spent most possible time in bed. You know, Adrian has turned you into a real mean bitch. Every body says so. Try to be nice. What do you think? Do you like this professor? I think you look better in jeans that in a turtleneck. Yes, professor. May I help you? Yes...what side of the building do your windows face? Are you the fire inspector? No, I'm a scientist. Well, I put my fire extinguisher in and all my exit rows are accesible. I'm a scientist. And you're studying windows. Well, windows have something to do with my research you see I'm an astrophysicist and I'm researching some phenomenon which has occured in some countries. I'm from West Berlin. Let me show you my...identification. Have you had dinner? No. Well I have a free evening tonight. Why don't we go upstairs and discuss a bite while we eat? All your costumes... they're just a participation in somekind of a phony theater. I only tell you this for your own good. It's a freak show. Are you trying to say that your blue jeans weren't theater? It's not the same thing. So your professor wore a three piece suit and blamed you for your jeans. And your jeans were too much. Don't you understand that your suit was also a costume? Is that your jeans did for love and sexual quality weird is no way wearing a costume. So you want me now, right? You have the best legs. We both have good legs. We had children they would have the best legs to stand. I thought I looked ugly and would give you diseases. It's a perfect place for watching. I'm ordering some chinese is that OK? It's perfect. You are wet. You have no right to do that I'm not your possession. It's so simple isn't it? Well you can have me. I don't wanna have you. I wanna make love to you. I'm telling this for your own good... I think you should go home. You've spent all your energy trying to get me excited and then... Want to throw me out? Please leave... Come here. Ok I'd like two orders of shrimp fried rice. An order of shrimp and pea pods. An order of shrimp with lobster sauce. And an order of jumbo shrimp. Owen...get up. -What I'm working on. -That's what I'm working on. Are you...a researcher? No I'm a TV producer, do you think that they exist? So you're looking for heroin and you don't want the police to know about it. Listen, this really has nothing to do with drug traffic. What can I do? Nobody really knows the true nature of these aliens. You're from Germany? Yes, Berlin. I'm jewish... So what connections do you think there can possibly be between UFO's and...heroin? What the fuck is going on in here? Have you ever seen a UFO ? Yes, this morning, that's why I'm here. Well that's very interesting. Would you like a drink? You can see it as well. I can see a UFO? Yes, through your window. You mean I can go over, there to my window, and I can look at it I can see a UFO? No, but you can see it through my telescope. Oh, you have a telescope with you? Yes, in my case. So why don't you set it up? I always dreamed about seeing a UFO. Hey, what did you say you were drinking? So you're dead now...shit. And you're going to hell. Straight from your marihuana jungles. Straight from your lies, your lies, your lies. You dropped it, fuck! Suits you well. You go to hell. Whe'll all go to hell. I'll go to hell too. But I know I'm damned. And you, never knew. So you weren't ready? to toll the bell. For me it's easy. From hell to hell I'm not dancing in marihuana jungles. I live in concrete mazes, stone and glass. Hard like my heart, sharp and clean. No romantic illusions to changing the world. I don't lie to myself. That love can cure because I know I'm alone. And you fucked that every day. You lived, you lied, you lied you lied. You go to hell? Suits you well. Shit! Ok, you wanna see an alien craft? You will see it. Look. You know I always dreamt to fuck a dead man, that's my chance. You're crazy. Sure I'm baby. That's why you like me, so let's fuck him. -Don't you touch him. -You want any? So you fucked twice today already. Don't do it! You don't like it baby, you don't have to watch. Crazy! Don't do it. Don't get moral with me, whore, you had to fuck him didn't you? I told you not to fuck him. This is my place I do what I want here. You can fuck any petty asshole who gives you a chance. You god damn whore! Don't you call me that you low-class freaking monster! Monster! I'm a monster? You let these guys walk on your bones, bitch! and you're gonna kill me with syphylis one day, you dirty cunt. Don't talk to me like that. Your mother was nuts, your father was a bum. You'll never go anywhere but to the Bowery you belong with the bums. You shut your mouth or I'll cut you baby. And nobody will fuck your ugly cunt. Why did you have to do that to him? He was a good man. He never did anything to you. That's a dead body. Now, let me see. That's an alien craft. That's an alien craft? Isn't it kind of small? The alien craft is about the size of a dinner plate, Who ever told you that aliens need as much space as people? Well, that's really quite a world that you showed me. You're a scientist as tall as the empire state building. and the aliens are as big as... Jumbo shrimp. I've available no other world to show you. Well, isn't it possible that that might be a child's toy? And not a UFO? Don't worry, forget it... We'll leave this fucking place, baby, and we'll go to Berlin. I wanna sing in the night clubs. Germans love me... We'll be happy. What are we gonna do with this body? Don't worry about the body... I know what to do, you wanna do it right now? Are you sure this has something to do with the UFO? Looks like two women just killed a man. This is not my first encounter with the aliens. Just watch in the long run you will see what happens there. Why don't they call the police? Why don't we call the police? They don't want the police to be involved. Why? Everyone has his own reasons for avoiding the authorites in their home. They have a very good reason, they've heroin there. I sure wouldn't like to be in their shoes right now. I wouldn't like it either. What are we gonna do? Just leave him there, we're going to Berlin baby, aren't we? Sure. We should have a wake. There's no food. So I go to the store and get some food. These are no protection for aliens. Oh! And do you have protection for aliens? You have a laser down in your pants? I think I need another drink. Wake up, honey... Come on get up and take a shower. I feel sick, Kathy. I know you feel sick. You took drugs today. No... Come on and stand up It'll make you feel better. Guests are already starting to arrive. Can't miss the party. Fuck the guests. You are brave, noble knight. Why don't you go overthere and freed those two beauties from the dragon?
