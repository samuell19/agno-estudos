NYMPH There are good and bad spirits. Bad spirits are like corrupt politicians. They're greedy, they keep stuffing themselves and creating all sorts of problems. They scare us with tricks and deception so we have to keep making merit for them. Let's get back to the child and the nails. The child had a stomach ache. His parents fed him an herbal potion, but it didn't help. They took him to the doctor, who prescribed the same potion. He took it for a week. He wasn't cured but he became addicted to the potion. Why didn't they X-ray him? That's why I told you the boy wasn't hexed. If he had, we'd have seen the nails from the X-ray. I think he was being harassed by some nasty ghosts. But why would the ghosts come after the boy? How the hell should I know? Maybe he pissed on the ground where they lived or something. The number you've dialed cannot be connected. Nop. Thanks, George. Which magazine are you shooting for? Siam Sky. Siam Sky. Sounds old-fashioned. No wonder they still want you to shoot with film. It's Master Kaew's magazine. He asked me for some stock photos I took before. But I told him I'd go into the forest to take some black-and-white shots for him. "Don't be seduced by the forest and forget to come back"...George I'll call you back, I'm in a meeting. Want to eat? I'll warm something up. It's all right, I already ate with a client. I'll go take a shower. Ok No, you know the boss won't pay the advance. Tell them the suppliers are already pressing us to pay the technicians for the set and the stage. Every time I go on a vacation some shit comes up and spoils it. I know you're busy. I'm already on my way out of town. You call him again today and tell him we're running a business, not a charity. If there's no one to sign the check, just pay us cash. It's just 1 million. We'll send a messenger to collect it. Right? Hold on. My mom's on the other line. Hi Mom. Again? Tell him death won't help, because he'll just be reborn and suffer again. Let him whine and he'll forget it soon. Haven't you gotten used to it? I know you're annoyed. Yes. Mom, I have my colleague waiting on the other line. It's important. I'll talk to you later. Ok? I'll call you back. Bye mom. Hello, yes, but how can we trust him? What if he refuses to pay after the job's done? If they refuse to pay 50 percent, tell them to make it 30. We're making a living here. Right? I'm going into the forest, I don't know if there'll be a phone signal there. I'll try to call you anyway. Ok? Take care. Thanks. "In water, bitten by fish Catching Shrimp Catching Fish by hand Making a living with your two hands, with your two hands Comfortably" Hi Jeed. I'll call you back. I miss you too. The hotel is so quiet, I can't talk too loud. No, I'm already outside the room. Don't say that. I'll be back in a couple of days. When is that? Are you really asking me? How many days? I'll have to think about it. I want to go, but I have to think of something to tell Nop. "40 Years ago, Chain was young He was born at "Dong Phayayen" Village Certainly, all kids from there think of going to the forest and hunting Chain also think that way going with his friends to hunt So? With gun Many times while he's in the middle of deep forest Chain is touched with charm of forest very fast Chain never shoot his own gun Very late night or follow to find out Why you follow me? We're here. It's ok, I'll do it myself. Did you see my laptop? Look in the back seat. Maybe you don't need that tonight. I can't sleep without it. It's all right if you can't. We're not going anywhere tomorrow. Good night. Where have you been? Can you see? - Where did you find them? - In the forest. What are you eating? Rabbit. Want some? Since when did you start eating rabbit? Today. It's very tasty. Wanna try? Let's make love. What's wrong with you? We haven't done it in months. I have a headache. Let's hold each other and go to sleep. It's too hot. Then let's take our clothes off. Just go to sleep, Nop. Nop! Nop! How long have you been camping? Two days. How many of you? - Two. - Just two. Did you fight? You mean generally? No, I mean before your husband went missing. No. Name? May. No. Your husband's name. Oh, Nop. Excuse me, are you married? - Yes. - For how long? Is that relevant? Look, ma'am, the more information we have, the better chance we have of finding him. Is it possible that he was attacked? By what? I don't know. Aren't there snakes and tigers in the forest? Those animals usually stay away from people. They're afraid of us, unless we provoke them first. They might... Hello, what's up? Hello. What? Where did you find it? When? A man or a woman? Thai or foreigner? Excuse me. Is your husband Thai? Yes. I told you to block off the tourists. There're so many of them out there. What happened to him? He was bitten by a dingo. Not a tiger? From the wounds it must be a dingo. He was mauled. Hey! Ma'am! Ma'am! What's wrong. So that's not him. No. Then why did you faint? Never been face to face with a dead body before. Maybe you should spend the night at the park office. You should. Tomorrow I'll take the villagers to go search the forest. Something like this happened 2 months ago with tourists from some finance company. Seven of them went trekking. Only 6 came out. Five. No, 6. No, 5. It was 6. No, 5. Two months ago? Yes, two months ago, only 5 came out. No, that was last month. - Six. - Five. Did you find the missing one? We hadn't started looking when he reappeared. He came out from the forest looking like a ghost. He must've angered the forest spirits so they blocked his path and he couldn't see the way out. You should come with us. I think I'll spend the night here. Just in case Nop returns. Aren't you afraid? A little. Do you want me keep you company? It's ok. Take this. Thank you. Nop! Nop! Nop! Nop! Nop! 4 missed calls from May Nop! Nop! Nop! Nop! Ma'am. Ma'am! Ma'am! Why are you sleeping out here? Excuse me, I'll take this back. May! I'm sorry Noi, I was in a meeting. That's why I had to shut the phone off. You're being paranoid. It's nothing, I'll be home by tomorrow evening. Sweet dreams. Good night. Thanks for bringing me home. Do you think Nop will be all right? I'll call you later. Nop! Where have you been? I was lost in the jungle. And how did you get out? A villager took me. What villager? A woman. She found me in the forest. She took me back to town and I took a bus from there. When did you get here? Just now. You're so cold, are you all right? Can you get me a glass of water? Move over. Sir. Sir. What? But Nop's back. Yes, he's been back for a week. I've been so busy I forgot to call you. Sorry about that. Thanks. Thank you again. Please say thank you to your colleague too. Good evening. Three more items. What's this? They're plants. I know, but where did you get them? I bought them. We don't have many plants around here. They'll make our house homier. I didn't know you gave up being a photographer and became a gardener instead. You're not going to stay and help? Maybe tonight. What're you doing? Hey, stop it. You can't go to work now. Wan. Wan. Yes, boss. Have you seen May come in? No. Thanks. Nop, are you hungry? No. You haven't eaten much since you came back. What? Stop it. Let's make love. You're crazy. Nop. Yes. I have something to tell you. About your boss? It's all right. I understand. Understand what? That things like this could happen. What does that mean? We've been married for years. We didn't take care of each other like we used to. We both are busy. You work with Korn. You see him every day. It could happen. You sound like you couldn't care less. I do care. But I couldn't stop you. If it hadn't happened last year, it could've happened this year, or next year. And didn't you ever want to do something about it? I didn't know what I had to do. I'm sorry. Let's make love. In here? Yes. Turn off the light. I broke up with my wife. How did she take it? Not very good. And you? Not very good either. But I'm relieved. At least I don't have to keep lying to her. And more importantly, she's free now. How do you know she wanted freedom? Move in with me. Don't you want to know how I feel about all of this? So how do you feel? Can you turn on the air-conditioning? We should stop seeing each other. What? I want to go back to take care of Nop. I've been very selfish these past 2 years. You'll go look for him? Nop's back. Since when? Since we came back from the forest. But I left my wife because of you. I'm sorry. I've just realized I still love him. How convenient. Nop, why are you sleeping here? What are you doing here? Where's Nop? I want to know where he is too. Nop! Nop! I don't think Nop ever came back. May! May! May! May! I'm sorry. Put that away. I'm not here to harm anyone. May. What did you do to her? Don't worry. That's not blood. It's the sap from the tree May quarreled with. Do you know which tree I'm talking about? Why did you two have to hurt her? What did she do to you? I'm sorry. For what? For having an affair with your wife. I wasn't surprised that you and May had an affair. But I'm surprised that... you let it get so out of control that you hurt your family. You should apologize to your wife, not to me. Thanks for bringing May back. I'm here to ask you and May to do a few things. First, I'd like you two to pray to the tree and ask her to forgive you. Second, I want you to leave this place and don't ever come back. And finally, I want you to go back to you wife and take care of her like you used to. I'm not sure about the last request. It's not that hard. But I don't love her any more. I know. You love my wife. Will you go back to May? That's all I ask of you. It was a pleasure meeting you. Do you want me to stay with you tonight? No, I think Nop will come back. Written and directed by PEN-EK RATANARUANG
