Oh, that feels so good. Right there. That's just what I need. This is pure ecstasy. More. Milk me more! You have the hands of a god, Ayane. Mow-ko. I'm begging you. Please give me all you have. Stop worrying. No man is immune to the charm of my milk. I must make the best chocolate for my prince. If it works, it will be thanks to me. If it doesn't work, it's all your fault. Done. Here we go. Back then, Ayane was in love. Ayane... Have you put on weight again? Here come the F4! They are intense! The F4 are so out there! Good morning, Ayane. Today's the day. My heart's thumping. Settle down, settle down. Mow-ko's milk chocolate is definitely going to work. This is your last chance before your prince graduates. Yeah. One month earlier. She fell in love thanks to an unbelievable incident. You okay? Can you stand? Yes. Excuse me. Thank you. Unbelievable, right? More importantly, he threw her! But I guess young princesses fall in love for unbelievable reasons. It's him. Your prince is here! Ayane. Now! I... I wanted to thank you for helping me the other day. I... I... I love you! Oh. You're that "Dosukoi." "Dosukoi"? It's what sumo wrestlers say all the time. You're "Dosukoi," right? He called her "Dosukoi"? Dosukoi. Dosukoi! Dosukoi... Bye. Hi, Hayato! Hayato! Her first love was shattered in no time. Are you okay? Ayane! Being called "Dosukoi" is kind of soul destroying. Eat up, please! Come on. Cheer up. It's yummy. We still have Lord Takumi! I LOVE YOU TAKUMI Dosukoi! AYANE IS DOSUKOI DOSUKOI! Dosukoi! Dosukoi! No! Ayane, what happened? Are you okay? Chihiro... I've had enough. Ayane, let's go to a beauty salon. A beauty salon? Huh? What? A beauty salon? I'm going, Mow-ko. Oh, okay... Take care. Bye bye! From: YAMANASHI To: TOKYO How have you been? Fine, thank you. How are you feeling today? Great, thank you. I've been here once before. You came here? When? A little while back. Ms. Sukehira? Welcome to Senang Daikanyama. I will be your therapist today. I am Kurata. Thank you for coming. Please follow me. Ayane, go for it. Sorry. I'll go around. Ms. Sukehira, are you ready? Um, yeah. Excuse me. Please come this way. I... I don't think I can do this. I'm sorry. Goodbye. May I ask what's wrong? Do you feel sick? Not really. It's just... I'm such a "Dosukoi." Dosukoi? Doing a trial course at a beauty salon won't change anything. To be honest, I don't have the money to become a regular member anyway. Ms. Sukehira. May I ask if there was a reason you came here today? I was heartbroken, and depressed. My friend brought me here to cheer me up. Then please, leave it to us. You were brave to come today. I hope you go home more relaxed. What is this? It's amazing. It feels so good! I want to help my clients look more beautiful, but that's not my only role. I want to give your heart a good rub down, too. My heart? Yes. When you have a lighter heart, you start to notice new things. I'm sure you'll find something new, too. Something that you'll love. When you have something you love, your whole life becomes richer. I'm here to cheer you on. Something I love... Now I'd like you to turn over and face upwards. Just a minute. Sure. Is there even one thing I love? Mow-ko's milk. Especially her... chocolate! Ciao! That's why I decided to lead a life surrounded by my true love, chocolate. Ayane, stop tasting the goods so much. Okay. Hello! Here, nobody cares whether I'm "Dosukoi" or not. Yes, this is paradise! Why are you eating doughnuts? We're doing yoga. Sorry. You'll end up like a cow. Is that what you want? My roommate Fred is a makeup artist. He's a boy, but on the inside, he's more girly than any girl. Listen up, Ayane. Being fat doesn't mean you can't look beautiful. Okay. The beauty I'm talking about comes from the inside. Okay! Improve yourself on the inside, and be a confident woman. Hey! Give that to me. Why do you keep on eating doughnuts? Sorry. Stop putting doughnuts inside your pockets! I don't have anymore. I sure hope not! Unbelievable. You had three doughnuts? That's all. You scare me. Formaggio. Formaggio. Cioccolato. Cioccolato. I am going to be confident. I am going to be confident! I'll be confident, and sparkle! Adorable! Indeed, I'll be just like that princess who spent a holiday in Rome! And then, one day, I'll meet my destiny. Come on! SUKEHIRA FARM Huh? What was that? Ayane? Fred... What a relief! You've been asleep for so long. You've lost so much weight! I lost weight? Beautiful! Is this really me? I was thrown into the sea, and beaten up all over. While I was in a coma, I became slim! To top things off... No! You can't move that. It would be too much. You can't. As a result of your injuries, several of your organs were damaged. We had to remove half of your stomach. You can't eat as much as you once did. You won't get fat anymore. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. ARRIVALS FROM ROME She's late. This is weird. I'm sure this is the flight. See? Guys! Huh? It's her! Ayane! Who are you? We're so glad you made it back safely! What are you guys doing here? Ayane? I'm over here! Was that Ayane's voice? Yeah. Where is she? No idea. She's not here. Wrong person, huh? I'm back! Are you really... Ayane? I'm back. I'm full. The old Ayane used to eat three mega-servings. Can I have it? Sure. Guys, have I changed that much? You can't tell? Yeah. You're the same on the inside, but you look totally different. I so envy you. Losing weight isn't that great. I got stopped because I didn't look like my passport photo. I got you guys souvenirs. Aki. Haruna. Chihiro. Thank you. Why are you back out of the blue? My parents heard about the accident. They told me to come home because they're worried. Will you go back to Yamanashi? I have nowhere else to go. What will you do for work? Your brother and his wife run the farm now, right? Where should I go? You know, nobody likes having a sister-in-law around. You're right. Ayane! Come with me! What? Just come in. Boss. Isn't today your day off? I have a favor to ask. Boss, do you remember her? She's the friend I brought here before. Really? You're that girl? It's been a while. You're wondering why she's so slim. It's a long story, so we'll skip it for now. Sorry, I'm just a little surprised. Boss, can you give Ayane a job? She doesn't have anywhere to go. This is quite sudden. Please. She's a hard worker. She's looked after cows since she was a kid. She's the best milker in Japan! But she's awkward around people, and she's clumsy. Well, she was, when she was fat. Still eats a lot of chocolate, and she's clumsy, but... Chihiro. Thanks. Sorry for springing that on you. Excuse us. We get a lot of VIPs here. Celebrities. CEOs. They all want it kept secret. So, if you wanted to work without attracting too much attention, this might be a good place. You would have to start as a trainee. Well... Or is there something else you'd rather do? No. Not right now. Then that's that. Way to go, Ayane! This is how I started working with Chihiro at Senang Daikanyama. You can do it. Daikanyama is the most stylish town in the city. I wonder if I can make it here. But as long as I stay inside this members-only beauty salon, I won't meet anyone who knows the old me. Nobody will call me "Dosukoi." AYANE SUKEHIRA I've found my very own sanctuary. Okay. Sorry to have kept you waiting. Please follow me. This way, ma'am. The years I spent milking Mow-ko paid off. Well, maybe that's why. Whatever the reason, they said I had the hands of a god. I didn't have to worry about people looking at me here. I was able to work with a peaceful mind. Well, that's what I thought... Can I have a word? Sure. I want you to fill in for me for an important client. Me? But I could never fill your shoes. You're the only one who can do it. Here. Okay? Okay. TAKUMI MINATO It's nothing. Are you ready, sir? Sure. He was about to become my first ever male client. Sorry to have kept you waiting, sir. She will be filling in for me today. At your service. "Sex-hira"? It's "Sukehira." I'm Ayane Sukehira. Ayane, right? I'm looking forward to it. From this day on, things got turned upside down in my sanctuary. Ayane? Oh, sure. What are you doing? You okay? I'm sorry. Calm down. Do your job. Did it have to rumble now? I will start now. I touched a man! Stop it. Calm down! Just think he's Mow-ko. How bad is Saori's wrist? It's only a slight sprain. She will be able to attend to you for your next appointment. Sorry for the inconvenience. Actually, I'd prefer to have you again. Your hands just feel really good. Thank you. You certainly must be tired. I'm too busy to be tired. Please relax while you're here. A long time ago, I came here as a client. When Ms. Saori gave me a massage, my heart felt more soothed than my body. That's why I aim to soothe my client's hearts, too. Thank you. When your heart feels lighter, you start to notice new things. Thank you. Please have some tea. Thanks. One thing... Yes? Wanna have dinner? Um, well, no, thank you. I see. Coming in. Takumi, the car's waiting out front. Okay. Huh? Welcome home, Ayane. Fred?! You haven't changed a bit. Want one? Of course not. So, how did you get in? I told the caretaker I was your brother and she let me in. That's scary. I'm going to live here for a little while. Huh? Live here? Yes. Until Lord Takumi completes his national tour. Yay! He really is hot. I could spend all day looking at him. He is the hottest! Lord Takumi! Ayane. How about dinner tomorrow? I'm sorry. Actually, I'm fine. I mean, my stomach always rumbles. Thank you for being so considerate all the time. But, um... I really am okay. I do eat properly. That's not why I'm asking you out. Eh? Then, why are you? I want to go to dinner with you. But, I mean, I really am okay. How can I get you to accept my offer? Why would you make such an offer to someone like me? You ask why? Am I not allowed? No, I don't think that's the issue... Then, we have a date. Takumi, it's time to go. Tomorrow's your day off, right? Join me. Takumi! You know the stairs around the corner from here? Yes. I'll be there at 5 p.m. tomorrow. I'll wait until you come. Takumi. Coming. Excuse me. Bye, Ayane. What... What am I supposed to do? Am I dreaming? Is this really happening? Is Lord Takumi playing with me? He must be. That must be the reason. But, what if he's serious? He couldn't be. But if this really is real, that means it will be... My first ever date? What do people wear on dates? I have to cancel. I don't have his contact. LINE PokoPoko: "CHIHIRO SENT YOU A CLOVER" Chihiro sent me a clover. It's time for a game. No. Games are not the solution, Ayane. You have to think, Ayane! Think, Ayane. You have a date tomorrow? Fred? When did you come? Leave it to me. That hurt! Stay still. Okay. Not too bad. Thanks. So, who is it? Who are you going on a date with? Well... Someone I liked back in school. I bumped into him. Just keep on your toes and don't mess things up. Sure. See you later. Bye! Sorry, Fred. He will come. He won't come. He will. He won't. He will. He won't. He won't... I knew it. Of course he wouldn't come for someone like me. You came! Well, I mean... I didn't think you would really come. Why? Time is precious for you. Why spend it with me? Meeting you makes it precious. Okay. Thank you. Ayane? Ayane, it's this way. Right. You okay? I'm fine. Welcome, sir. Thank you for coming. It's Takumi! If I get too close, people might jump to conclusions. We can't talk at a distance. It's beautiful! That wasn't me. YOUR CLOVER'S BACK Mr. Minato, do you play LINE PokoPoko, too? You caught me. I play, too. Level 900? Wow! This is the one thing I'm good at. May I? Okay. Wow. Oh, sorry. Okay. Now we're friends. I'll send you a clover. When I send you a clover, take it as a message. A message? Yes Yeah. I'll send one when I want to see you. Is something on me? No, I was just watching how you smiled. Um... Can I ask you a question? Why did you invite someone like me? Why? Because I wanted to be with you. But there's nothing special about me. That's not true. Don't say that. Okay. You did have something on you. It's probably my manager. Mr. Minato... Aren't you going to answer it? Call me Takumi. Call me Takumi. Welcome back. So, how was your first kiss? Why ask that? Look at you. Even an alien could tell. We didn't kiss. Oh, that's a shame. You played hard to get. What were you doing to my Takumi? He really is so cute. Fred. Do you think it's okay for me to fall in love? You already have. Look how confused you are. That explains it. You polished up alright today, honey. See you later. Bye! LINE PokoPoko: "TAKUMI SENT YOU A CLOVER" LINE PokoPoko: "AYANE SENT YOU A CLOVER" Takumi, it's time. Okay. Break a leg. Thanks. Good afternoon, Mr. Yokohama. This is your therapist for today, Sukehira. I'm Ayane Sukehira. At your service. Nice find. Congrats. But I'm only here today to give you this. They're holding a party for my 60th birthday. It's a bit embarrassing, but that's an invitation. Congratulations. Congratulations. I would love to attend, but unfortunately, I must go to Osaka to sign the contracts for our new branch. Fine. Forget about it. Will you come in her place? Me? Take the manager's place. But, I've never been to anything like a party. I don't even have a dress. There's nothing to worry about. Let me prepare everything. So, I'll see you there. Thank you. Mr. Yokohama has been our VIP for many years. He also provided the funds to open this salon. Ayane, you'll represent the salon at the party, right? We're counting on you. Okay. She's sexy. Look at this. Hello, honey. She's beautiful. Huh? What is it? Sorry. You're that "Dosukoi." Oh, Hayato. Ayane, too. Do Mr. Yokohama and Hayato know each other? Mr. Yokohama, thank you for inviting me. You look beautiful. Mr. Yokohama. Ai. Happy birthday. Thanks. Let me introduce you. She works at my favorite salon. She's a therapist. Oh. Would you happen to be Ayane? I am. I've seen her somewhere before... Thanks for being so kind to Takumi. He told me all about you. He said you're a really charming person. Not at all. Are you friends with Takumi? Both Mr. Yokoyama and Mr. Minato are clients at our salon. Mr. Yokohama, happy birthday! Oh, Mr. Kaburagi. It's great to see you. You, too. Nice timing. Let me introduce you. He's Hayato. I'm Hayato. Hello. What a fine young man. Come this way. What a relief. He wouldn't remember me anyway. Do you know Hayato, too? He was my senior in high school. You had a crush on him? He was your first love? I guessed right? It was so long ago. Apparently that girl used to be a fan of yours. But now, she's hooked on Takumi. They say she's got "the hands of a god." Takumi goes to the salon all the time. So, Takumi fancies her. Hey. Can you do something about her? Ayane. It's you... Hayato. Can we talk over there? For you. Thank you. Takumi and I are in the same agency. He's my senior. But I still have a long way to go compared to him. I see. I want to go home. I want to go before he realizes it's me. Were you really my fan? Well, I think we went to the same high school. Really? Did we ever speak? No, we were in different grades. Even so, it's not like me to forget such a beautiful girl. I know. What do you think you're doing? Now I won't forget. Takumi? Takumi. Hi. That really suits you. Think so? Oh, you're here, too? Oh, Ms. Aso. Good evening. Don't those two look good? The actress, Ai Fujishiro. She's an actress? That's why she seemed familiar. You probably see her commercials every day. Don't tell me... You really don't know? The actress and the pop star. They're the biggest couple. They're... a couple? They sure are. Could you do me a favor? Don't make my job more complicated. Complicated? Takumi. Chats up all the pretty girls. I don't know what he told you, but I hope you're not taking it seriously. Ayane. Mr. Yokohama. I'm sorry, but I must leave soon. You don't like these kind of parties? No, that's not it. I'll see you out. You don't have to. I couldn't let such a beautiful guest leave by herself. Shall we? Thank you. Um... I wanted to talk to you. Oh, that's right. This is... Happy birthday. Thanks. Mr. Yokohama. Ayane. But... What are you doing? Motoko. Just picking this up. Excuse me. My husband doesn't care who they are, as long as they're young and pretty. Be careful. Darling, can I have a word? You're a fool. You can't accept every guy's invitation. Fred. You had a scary day. It's okay. Fred. What am I? You don't know? You're you, Ayane. You're right. At the end of the day, I haven't changed a bit. Ayane? I got everything wrong. I'm such a fool. Ayane. You have to love yourself. I can't. Not someone like me... If you can't love yourself, you won't be able to love anybody. You have to start off by loving yourself. Let's go. MINATO TAKUMI 13:00 That really suits you. Hi. Mr. Hayato? I'm sorry, but I have a reservation. Takumi, right? He might not make it, so I came. Disappointed? No. Follow me. You okay? Concentrate on your job. Can I fall for you? Date me, not Takumi. Hayato. What are you doing here? Your manager said you were running over schedule. I took your place. What the hell are you doing? Besides, isn't it a bad idea? You'll be the two-timing pop star. I'm not two-timing. Ayane. I broke up with Ai. I want to see you tonight. Please. Did you really break up? Takumi's just saying that. I slapped him. I have no intention of breaking up. More importantly, I found something quite interesting. Sorry I didn't tell you about Ai. I saw you two at the party. I had no idea you were together. We've known each other for so long. It's complicated. "A long relationship." That sounds nice. Ayane. You... You don't know anything about me. I'm not who you think I am. The only reason I can go out in public is because I have my boss and friends. But this isn't the real me. What do you mean? Are you trying to say you're "Dosukoi"? Ai. Why don't you just say it? "People used to call me Dosukoi Sukehira." Dosukoi? Ayane said she went to school with Hayato. So, I looked for your school album on the Internet. Then... Someone sent me this. Who's that? It's you, right? Ayane Sukehira. What are you talking about? It's nothing like her. It's me. That "Dosukoi" is... It's me. Things happened. I lost a lot of weight. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. My stomach always rumbles. It's like a memory from the old days. I still can't stop eating snacks. My room is a mess, too. When I have a day off work, I just stay at home and play games. I really am hopeless. I'm nothing... Ayane. There is nothing going on between Takumi and myself. There's no way anything could happen. Excuse me. The paparazzi are waiting outside. If you follow her, there will be a scandal. Wait. Good evening. Can I ask you a few questions? Ayane! Her name is Ayane? Takumi, do you have a minute? I MIGHT NOT COME HOME TONIGHT Who's that? Oh my god. Takumi is such a jerk. I could like, really kill that girl. Hey. TAKUMI MINATO'S LOVE TRIANGLE TAKUMI MINATO'S LOVE TRIANGLE Are you talking to me? Yeah, you. You have some explaining to do. About what? About you stealing my Takumi! What's with them? It's Ayane Sukehira. Is it true you're dating Takumi? Did you know he was dating Ms. Fujishiro? Please make a comment. Sorry, you've got it all wrong. Excuse me! Ayane, Ai Fujishiro is holding a press conference. How do you feel about the news in the tabloids? Oh, thanks. Takumi and I share a great relationship. The person he had dinner with last night is a mutual friend. I was there myself, too. It's been reported that things got messy during dinner. Of course they didn't. And I happen to know she has a lover by the name of Hayato. Hayato? That's not true! What is she saying? She's had a crush on him since high school... Hi! Hayato? Hayato, from high school? So, it looks like I'll be your boyfriend for a while. Got it? Ayane, you're dating? When did this happen? I know nothing about it. This is all Mr. Yokohama's idea. He knows people in showbiz. Our boss asked him for help. This is his damage control. If Takumi was caught two-timing, his image would be ruined. They'd cancel his commercials, TV series and films. The penalties would be enormous. We have to avoid that, right? Meanwhile, I'm still just a rookie. There's less damage for me. In fact, I can do with the media attention. But, won't that be a complete lie? We can make it real. I like you. I'll protect you. Why don't you come back to Yamanashi with me for a while? The press are everywhere. We should lay low until things calm down. Yamanashi? I can see Mow-ko. We'll have good food. Good rest. You'll forget all about Takumi. And he has no intention of breaking up with Ai. They're going to get married. Ayane. You okay? This is it. Thank you. What? What are you doing? I'm your first love, right? Hayato... Do you remember me now? Ai told me. She said you couldn't forget your first love. What a surprise. Who would've guessed that fatty was you? "Dosukoi"? What a cruel name. So, you don't remember? That day you saved me. From that day on, I only had eyes for you. You were my first love. I worked so hard to make you Valentine's Day chocolate, then I confessed my true feelings. To me? Yes. Sorry. I get so many Valentine's gifts, I don't remember everyone's face. To make things worse, I hate chocolate. But that's when you said it. You called me, "Dosukoi." I did? But after we met again, you said you liked me. I was so happy. Maybe it was because I've changed. You're nothing like the fatty you were. Look at you. The way I look? Forget about the past. You're beautiful now. When Takumi finds out we're together, he'll give up on you, and get back with Ai. Does that mean... Takumi broke up with Ai? I don't know. Please tell me. Did Takumi really break up with her? "Takumi this." "Takumi that." Give me a break. Ai wants to get back with Takumi. I want to steal you from Takumi. It's a win-win situation. They broke up? This is such a turn off. Hayato. Did you come after me because you wanted to beat Takumi? You're right. Takumi's always beaten me, at every single audition. He always gets what he wants. That's why I want to steal you from him. Hayato... You were my first love. Back then, I really admired you. But now... Now you're just a jerk. LINE PokoPoko: "TAKUMI SENT YOU A CLOVER" I'll send one when I want to see you. Ouch. You okay? Why? I finally found you. I came to see you. Why would you come for somebody like me? I told you. Don't talk like that. But I am just "somebody like me." After all, I hate myself more than anything else. I hate myself so much, I've always stayed in the shadows. I didn't believe in myself enough to believe what you were saying. I was scared that one day, you'd discover the real me. Then you'd hate me. I wanted to see you. I don't care about the past. I love you. Found him! There he is! Let's go! Please give us a comment! Mr. Minato, wait! Ayane, get in! Chihiro! Hurry up! Come on! Lord Takumi, get in! Mr. Minato... a comment! A comment, please! SUKEHIRA FARM Mow-ko, I'm home! Huh? Who are you? Ayane? Really? I missed you so much. You sure lost weight. You're good! Good girl, Mow-ko. Let's eat. Sausage, please! This meat is so juicy. You want some, right? Of course he does. The sausage! It's ready! Look at the other side. I got oil on my face. Is this one ready? Don't touch those yet. They're not ready. Thanks for coming. Have you spoken to Mr. Minato about what's been in the news? Some reports say you've broken up with Mr. Minato. Are they true? Ms. Fujishiro, could you comment on that? Firstly, I'd like to apologize. To all of the people who work with Takumi Minato, and to his fans. I have created a great deal of inconvenience and concern. I offer my deepest apologies. I truly am sorry. I first became acquainted with Takumi as a co-star in my debut film. At the time, I didn't know right from left. But he said to me, "You'll be okay." He reassured me every day. Whenever times were tough, or too much, all I had to do was recall those words. "You'll be okay." That was enough to help me get through. If I hadn't met Takumi, I wouldn't have become the person I am. So now, I think it's my turn. If he's ever troubled, or in pain, I hope I can be there to support him. I'm gonna go. Thanks. Shouldn't you go after him? Ayane. You may have lost some weight, but we will always be the FAT4. Chihiro. You are you. Aki. No matter what happens, we'll always be on your side. Haruna. We're rooting for you! Thanks, guys. Don't give up! You'll be fine! We love you, Ayane. We'll give you all our power. Power! Good morning, Mow-ko. Okay, let's check these. Break time, guys. Here comes your prince! Now! You scared me! What? What? Um... Hayato. I love you! What's that? Chocolate. Sorry. I actually don't like chocolate. I'm sorry. Hey. Thanks. Thank you! I did it! Way too sweet. Ayane. Thanks for coming. I talked it out with Ai. I admired Ai's press conference. She stood tall and told the world she'd be there to support you. I couldn't do that. Ayane. But I don't want to give up. So, I'll try on my own for a while. I need to love myself. I need to become a better woman. I'll try harder. If I'm ever able to stand tall and tell the world I love you, can I come see you? Please see me. Don't keep me waiting for too long. This is delicious. You are such a fool. How could you say no to Takumi? Damn. Why didn't anybody love me? Fred, I think I'm starting to like myself. So, am I more of a woman now? If you keep eating like that, you'll become Dosukoi again. I don't mind being Dosukoi. It's starting to show. What is? My stomach? I don't mean that. Your inner beauty. You still have a long way to go. Really? I'm overflowing with beauty, right? No way. Not even close. Dosukoi!
