Denver City Hotel, Coolgardie. These girls are leaving on the 17th. They're ready to travel. Saved their money and ready to go. So I need two to take their place probably about on the Wednesday. About three days before. Well, I mean there's... you know, I don't want 'em 44 stone. If you know what I mean. I don't want 'em polishing the bars both sides. I mean, if they look good, we can do away with the experience bit. But if they're ordinary they've gotta have plenty of experience because they've gotta make it up with something else, don't they? We've gotta keep the customers happy. - Hello. - Hello. - Grab a seat, girls. - Thank you. - Hi. - Hello hello. Okay, now, who's here? - I have Gina Nikolina - - Yeah, I'm Lina. - Lina? And...? - Stephanie. Stephanie. Excellent. Okay. - So, where are you guys from? - Finland. Finland. And how old are you? - Twenty-five. - Twenty-five. - I'm twenty-four. - You came straight from Finland? We came from Bali. You have another trip planned that you have to do - - No no we don't have any plans. - We want to save money. Okay, because most of the bar positions I have would be a three month commitment. - Yep. - Okay. I need to know up-front that you're willing to say yes. - Yes. - Definitely three months. So we're in Perth. Kalgoorlie is here, which is like a big mining town and this town is called Coolgardie. So you're close enough to a larger town where you can go. You've got your Coles, your Woollies. But Coolgardie itself, as you can see, is quite remote. It's quite a big mining area so a lot of the clientele at the pubs are going to be gentlemen. So you guys have to be the kind of girls that are okay to have male attention and not really sweat it. - Yeah. - Yeah. So do you know who the other girls are? We have no idea. But they're coming tomorrow, though. Some fresh meat. Have we got a bit stale for you, Derek? Yeah. So that's them. Lina and Steph. I don't know which one's which but one will answer to Lina. I'll go and cut some pictures out of some of my mags and we'll stick em there so people think they look like em. The train is due today at 2pm in Kalgoorlie so that means it's 1.35 for us. We're going... I have no idea. No, we're going to work. Save some money. - Have fun. - Have fun. Nah, it's good to have the new girls come in every now and then. Keeps the pub alive. Well, sometimes it's sad to see the old ones go because you've built up a relationship sort of with 'em but then you get new ones in. I've got a couple of mates that have hooked up with barmaids. And they have families with 'em and shit like that. - Thank you. - Howdy, girls. Thank you. - Hi. This is the one. Thank you. Okey dokey. Downtown Coolgardie. Where the flies are very friendly. Righto. - Yes. A little bit. And this is the pub. Look I even wrote that on the board for ya. Perfect. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Stephanie. - Nice to meet you. Hey. Nice to meet you too. Righto, now. That's where you heat your meals up if you wanna. Fridge there. There's a shoe library there. And that's the park over there. Swimming pool on the other side. Golf course just at the back of the railway museum over there. You've just had a guided tour. Perfect. Between five and eight you get most of your customers. Like after work, when all the miners finish. And it's quite good cos the regulars come in every day. Don't they? Same ones. Everyone has a yarn. A what? - Like a chat. A yarn. - Oh yeah. Food. You'll be sorry you left Coolgardie. I know, I will. I actually might even shed a tear. - Hi. - Hi. Hey. Right. I will show you what's what. We've got the back bar. In here you've got the Vodka Cruisers. And your Jim Beams and your Bundies. People call it Toohey's or Teds. Yep. Okay. Then you've got middies and then pints. - Just press a middy twice. - Okay. - How're ya goin', okay? - Nice to meet you. Now Canman, he always has his first one free when he comes in. - Where you from? - From Finland. Have you met the puppy dogs outside? Did we what? What I like was just to make sure they're alert and reasonably quick. Everybody gets a drink quick as they possibly can. Apart from that I think the challenge for them is to be able to put up with the patrons. The boys were saying at work. They're coming down after work. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Some of the old blokes as well. You know, they... They all grow a leg. That'd be the go. Which one's the better one's? If they're worth the swap? - Okay. - Yeah? - How's it going? - Good. You had a drink? No, not yet. No? If you leave it in the spout and when you turn it off it'll stop doing that frothing thing. It's alright, you'll learn. We'll educate 'em mate, don't worry about that. You can give him that one. Give him that one. You know why? You didn't swap the glass. You've got to give him a clean glass every time. Every time. - Oh, okay. - Okay. You've had a warning. Shake hands. Now give me a kiss. Good girl. - A slab - A slap? Oh, not a slap. No, a slab. Okay, four-X of middy. That's it, look at the numbers up the left hand side, mate. About halfway down. You'll see Emu Bitter, Emu Export. - Oh yeah. - One of those, just press it. Not takeaway. Is it draught or bitter? Fuck me dead. What'd I just say? I said Export. Doesn't say fucking Draught or Bitter. Emu export? Okay, just press that one. - Hey. - Ginty. Lina. - Damian. - Lina. - Peter. - Lina. - Keiran. - Lina. Nice to meet you all. Pull down, and just leave it. No no no, you leave it there. Okay. Okay, that'll do. There you go. Thank you. Righto then. Righto. And we're gonna be on the other side of the bar. We'll initiate these new girls to the pub. Woo! What are you doin'? What's goin' on here? See, there's people coming in here. They gotta be served. You just... you can't all just stop for fuckin' no reason. You're right in it, mate. You're standing in the middle of it. Cans? In the middle. In the middle. Fuck me dead. What are you lookin' for? What are you lookin' for? Ask me. - Strongbow. - Right there. Do they have them in six pack? - No, like just bottles. - Just bottles. Yeah, just put em in a bag. These ones are gonna get nothin' in their fuckin' tip jar. Fuckin' hell. Do it, quick. Just open one up. - Huh? - Bloke thinks his throat's cut. He can't get a drink. - Wine glass. - Here. Hey, what are you doing with that? Hey! Steph! Steph! Steph. What are you doing with that? I'm going to put it there. And where'd you get the money from? Out of there, did you? Yeah. Well you fuckin' put the thing in where you got the money from. Don't put it that till. Put it in that till. Okay. Yep. This is gonna be hard work, I can tell you that. Yeah. Fuckin' anywhere across the English Channel, they're fucked. Hey? Hello! Where'd you come from? I've a very, very small penis. It's like... it's like... I don't want to know. - It's like that. - Yeah. So if we have sex it will be bad but it will be very quick. So it's not so much of a problem. Ah, Steph, can I've another Swan? - Who're those blokes? New? - This is the chefs at the motel. Now listen, what do you eat in Finland? Seals. You like a bit of seal? Reindeer? - Dolphins? Seals? - No. Yeah. Pour us some tequilas. - Alright, cheers! - Yay! Couple of tequilas. - Show us ya tits! - Thank you. Oh, I didn't mean to do that. They're fuckin' slow, these two, I'll give you the tip. This one'd be fucked by herself. There's nobody in here and she wouldn't be able to handle that you know what I mean? You look like you're enjoying it! Fuck knows. Obviously it's not that flash. And whatever they're eating, that's what I eat. Steph! Steph! - Steph! - Steph! Steph! Steph! - Steph's deaf. - Stephanie! Steph! You got the money right? You sort it out yet, or...? Doesn't matter. Just put it in a drink. Don't listen to her. Shut the fuck up. If it's not fizzy it's fucked. Throw it out. Throw it out, honey. We're gonna have trouble, you and me. Where do you have more of them? - Don't worry. - Just put it in the drink. - You can't put that in a drink. - You, shut up. You just drive trucks. You tell em how to drive trucks, I'll tell 'em how to pour piss. Shut the fuck up. See what I mean? He's a hard man. That's the best fuckin' thing I've heard all night. He's a fuckin' hard man. Cheers. - Oggie Oggie Oggie! - Oi oi oi! - Oggie! - Oi! - Oggie! - Oi! - Oggie Oggie Oggie! - Oi oi oi! That's for the girls. - For the holiday. - Give me a pint glass. - Got another two dollars. - Give me a pint glass. No. Fuck me dead. The poor little prick hasn't got any fuckin' idea. She's never done this before in Australia, ever. No, but God love em. Takes a while for them to settle down. What's that young girl's name? Steph, have you set... Maybe she's as dumb as dog shit mate. You know what I mean? You can take a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. It's not open. They welcome you to Coolgardie. Ah, Stephie, chips or mash? - Huh? - Chips or mash? - Chips. - Chips. Thank you. Scotch, seven hundred. - What have you found? - Oh yeah. - And how much is it? - Forty eight. - It's good that you're helping. - Hey? It's good that you're helping. Yeah, I know. And they're all Australian. I have never heard about them. - Haven't ya? - No. You drink wine? Yeah, I drink wine. Let's go. Bye, room. Excuse me! Oi! Oi! Pepper and salt. Obviously there's no pepper and salt in Finland! - What nationality are you? - I'm Finnish and German. Ah, see, Finnish. If you don't look after him, you Finnish. You know, all the rest go... And we do have a connection there 'cause we can fluently speak the language. Oi. Righto. Wellsy, there's the key for tomorrow. I've written a couple of cheques. I've signed a couple of cheques. That'll be all cool? Canman'll get the stock, everything will be clean when you take over. - You've met these girls? - Yeah. - You know Wellsy, don't you? - Yeah. - John's taking over tomorrow. - Yeah. And he'll be here for a week, then Tony'll be here for a week. - And then I'll be back. - Okay. And I want to see it bloody running by the time I get back. Piggy! Come on. Pig, you ready? Hey! Hey! In you go. You're in the wrong seat. That's Piggy's spot. Cowgirl. For the barmaids. Oh, Canman. - Cowgirl! - Yeah. Thank you. What is it? What a surprise. We're drinking again. - Pikey! - How are ya, mate? Yes! Boom. They're still here, drinking. Screaming. You don't have to, but it's up to you. Come on. Cut filling up the fucking ketchup bottles. What are you, ketchup woman? Can I get another can please? Goodnight. Steph, would you be fine if we just came upstairs? Just for a wee one? Let's go. Go man, go! Go. Sorry girls, but I really want to sleep. Okay, we're walking down. We're going. 'Night. - Goodnight. - 'Night! Just bring me lots and lots of these. And then take that out of that one and if there's any silver shit to go with that, that's yours. I don't take silver. You don't take silver? - So... - Thank you. You get a tip out of it. You gotta make some money somehow. Without any disrespect to the females 'cause they work hard but the race is on onto who's gonna tag it first and who's gonna put their name to her first. And it's like, mate, you know no need to fight about 'em. There's gonna be two more come in the next couple of weeks. Don't worry about it. I'm from Finland. They're only out for one thing, anyway. They're only out for one thing and it's not the real thing that they should be going for. They should be, instead of trying to get in their pants, take em out and show em a bit of Australia. Yeah, let's do that. And show you a bit of outback. - Let's do that. - Hopefully we'll see a snake. The costs of gold mining nowadays, there's a lot of... a lot of energy involved. Like with the electricity or paying wages. And having gay people... I'm sorry, not gay people but... soft cocks. Like have a fuckin' go, you know like... Living in a shithole, blokes living in Sydney or Melbourne and we're up here doin' it fuckin' hard living in a fuckin' caravan. - So when do you get a break? - Tomorrow. Tomorrow night? This'll make you feel happy. If you're in Coolgardie, this'll become your best friend. Just give it a month. How many years did you study? - Four? - I did Honours. Four years to become a Bachelor? I did an Honours year. - Four years? - Honours. I became a Master in... - Five. - Yeah, this is in Finland. - Five and a half years, yeah. - Finland, Finland, Finland. No, it's just because I'm so clever. Australia, Australia. Look at Stephanie. She's fuckin' beautiful. Look at her. Stephanie. Oh, she's so attractive. Yeah! And... - What's my name? - Mrs Economics. No, I'm not Mrs Economics. What's my real name? Lani? Len... Well you probably weigh fifty. You probably weigh fifty. Yeah. Do you wanna just sleep together and have a massive gang bang and... No? You're gonna be very lonely, then. Why in the fuck not? I'll have a shave. - No. - No? You can go and get fucked. I don't really care. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. I thought she would've been up but no hurry. I've got all day. We're getting gifts all the time from all the people here. And it's weird. We're not used to getting presents all the time, every day. He brings us alcohol. We got how many bottles? Four? - Shampoo. - Chocolate. Yeah. Anthony came here to pay for his Jack's bottle. Yeah, I've been to the pub to apologise to Nina for my crude behaviour last night. When I was very much pissed. Yeah. He was a bit embarrassed for yesterday. Propositioning her. But he still couldn't remember my name. I know I will do. I'm not going anywhere near Jack Daniels for at least a week. Don't wanna ruin it for myself. I don't want to make it harder. Yeah, I know. - Hey? We won't be long. - Where? Kalgoorlie. - I do. - No. - Yeah. - No. I don't want to. I wanna go Cape York and I wanna go driving all the way to the tip. Yeah. Try and find a small pub or something away from the shit. You can make a lot of money in tips but you've also got the danger factor as well. Like getting stabbed in the eye. Getting stabbed in the shoulder. That was in The Cross. How many times did you get stabbed? Twice. But the bloke who got me in the eye he got his knife back. Straight into the kneecap. - Rematch? - No. Come on. I need to eat. I can't let a girl starve. Thank you. No you can't. See ya. So you liking the job so far? - Yeah. - That's good. It's really nice. A lot of really nice people. Friendly people. - Most people are very friendly. - Yeah, really friendly people. Yeah. Just work hard. Everybody around here knows me, calls me the Canman. Not John or Jason or anything. Canman. I walk in and some of the staff knows me. And knows what I want. Knows what I like. You can have one behind the bar. No one'll see it. - Hmm? - What? I love you, dear. Let's get pissed. And this is worth its weight in gold. Fuckin' oath it is. Oh my God. Really? To have naked girls in the bar? What's wrong with that? What's wrong with that? Oh my God. Oh, hello. There we go. Look at it. - That's pretty heavy. - Tickle tickle tickle. - I don't want to see it. - That's everything, look. Come here, come here. Have a look. Look! Is that you? - Yeah. - It is. Not here. I had a pub in Perth. This has got nothing to do with Coolgardie. - Thank you for showing me. - Look at this. - Where's the barmaids gone? - Thank you. What are you hugging? And touching? - You. - Yeah. How long have you been together? - Too long. - Twenty sixth... 26th of March it was 35 years. - You've never been married? - No. I haven't found the right person. Oh, it's what you make of it, you know? A lot of people try. Yeah, me too. Bitches just don't like me. I got two fuckin' chicks fuckin' pregnant and they had abortions. - How do you think it made me feel? - Is that right? It's alright. Well, what do you do? Nothing you can do about it, is there? Kill 'em. Tell you the truth like everyone else, it's like they can pick up like fuckin' women but I can't because I don't know how to actually talk to 'em properly like other cunts can. But other people like they can actually talk to 'em. And know what to say and fuckin' next minute they're goin' home with 'em and like I don't know how other people fuckin' do it. I'd probably fuckin' say lovey shit, I don't know. I don't know. I've just told em what I fuckin' wanna do with 'em. Let's go back to my house and fuck like rabbits. No, seriously. I used to. I've had violence in my life all the fuckin' time since I was fuckin' spat out in this world. But I hold it all the time when I come here. I mean I could just snap and just go fuckin' ballistic and just belt every cunt right now. It wouldn't matter. I could walk away, have a cigarette, no care in the world. Maybe a chick just doesn't wanna fuckin' I don't know, a fuckin' a thing like me. With no licence, no car, fuckin' nothin' going for him. Well just think if I asked fuckin' Lina out for a date and I asked her out for tea how do you think I'm gonna fuckin' take her out? Fuckin' taxi. That's not gonna fuckin' look good on me, is it? Why would a taxi be the problem? Yeah but... so? So, if you take me in a taxi there and pay for the taxis. What's the problem? There's no problem. Oh well when aren't you working then and we'll do it. See, look at her now. She's just disgusted, like 'you prick.' - There you go. - Thank you. Shits and giggles. Shits and giggles. Hey. Hey Noopy. Good morning, Canman. - How are you? - I'm alright. Oh my God. It is. And she wrote me a letter. I was married. Wanted to know if I was the natural father. I said yes. 'Do you want to keep in contact with me?' I said yes. My wife couldn't get on with her so she went to South Australia. I haven't heard from me daughter in about two years or more. I think of her all the time, wonder where the hell she is. - Hey? - Eighty-eight dollars? Bit of beer money. - Thank you, Canman. - Thank you. Oh, it's beautiful! Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Stephanie Wait wait wait wait, I have to take a picture. Where is this fuckin' girl? Is she serving? What's she doing? - Is it good? - Yeah. See you tomorrow. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. See you. Eight cans? Yep. Well, this is where we live. We have girls. Open the door. Open the door up. - Here, ladies. - No no no no no no. I don't like spiders. No. No! - No, where's the spider? - Come here. - No! - Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it! Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it. No, go away. It's a fucking spider! I'll catch it for ya. - Stephie? - Mmm? You should look after your friend? My friend? Well, it wasn't me that invited him. I invited myself. Yeah I know. At a housewarming party, barbecue, pool party at my friend's place. Was it nicer than today? Yep. But Stephie, this is almost like Bali. You're pretty sober for a birthday girl. Yeah. Go on. No. What? He's here. Morning. - Huh - That helps. See? Yeah. - Huh? - Then me ex-girlfriend took it. Oh yeah. Took the lot. Car, everything. Huh? Why? Why? Oh, right. It's nice and peaceful out here. Yeah. This is what I like doin', comin' out and chillin' out. Sounds good. Yeah, I wouldn't go swimming in there, but. - No, it's pretty dirty. - Yeah. It's just all mud. - There you go, mate. - Thank you. Thank you, I enjoyed today. Thank you for taking me and showing me these places. See you. See ya. - Thank you. - No worries. They're backpackers, mate. They get cracked onto by every man so they're probably thinking, 'that's just someone else crappin' onto 'em. But it's just to get em out of the pub and doin' something. Seeing a bit of around here. It'd be good if something developed but I'm not looking for it. The company's good enough. You must've made an impression. - What's your name? - Stephanie. Stephanie. Go on, get shitfaced. I wanna see you drunk. Yeah. But it takes a long, long time. - Alright, we'll see. - It does. That sounds like a drinking challenge. My record's 86 cans in one night. It's really empty today. Yeah, so's my can. Scream to her. No, barmaids aren't dogs. Yeah I know, but people think that. Yeah, no, well they're not. There you go. My ex, um... slept with a lot of my friends and a couple of my bosses. We broke up. We tried to get back together. I just couldn't trust her. And a relationship's nothing without trust. So we went our ways and she remarried and well she got married and every time I've tried to see me daughter, she disappears. Been six years now since I've seen me daughter. When she was born she was about thirty-two centimetres. Laying on this hospital bed, covered in all this equipment. Tried to get her stable so they could put her in the helicopter. And they're saying that if she dies on the way, if she dies, she's meant to die. I knew that they were gonna turn the machines off and I went up there, thinking that I was going to say my goodbyes. Yeah, they said 'we don't know what's going on, but... your daughter's there breathing for herself.' But that's what made me realise no matter what happens in your life, mate don't give up. I have to stop crying. And I'm really happy your daughter is still alive and I... She's coming back and you're gonna find her. It's all good, mate. I have to stop crying. I probably had to go through all that shit so I could help other people out. Since I've straightened me life out I've built ministry centres for my sister's church I've cooked for the homeless. I've helped hundreds of people through drugs, just talkin' to em and you know showin' em that there is a future after drugs. That's really amazing. I don't fight, but that New Year's I did. Knocked three blokes out, left one out cold on a railway line. Punched one bloke over a picnic table. Another bloke he got one punch in the gut and collapsed. Bam! Yeah I fuckin' king-hit him. Anthony and I have been planning the wedding. Ahuh. Constant sexual satisfaction is our aim. Because there's two of us and both of us... Yeah, like this, strong. I'll catch youse later, eh? Goodnight. - See ya, bro. - See ya. He hasn't seen his daughter in, what was it, six years? Yeah. He hopes that some day she will come and find her Dad. It costs 20,000 dollars to get a private investigator to try to find her. - Did you see what we got today? - Plastic bracelets from Canman. There's something wrong with these people. And now we have to wear them. If he sees that we're wearing them it probably makes him really happy. - But he won't even remember. - Yeah he does. Nuh. - I'm gonna go to sleep. - Don't fall asleep. You are not sleeping on the couch. Shh! - Just go to bed. - No, you're going home. I don't have fuckin' keys. I've lost my keys. Dave took em. I don't fucking care. - Don't be so harsh. - You're not sleeping here. I'm not sleeping anywhere near you. I'm sleeping on the couch. You're not sleeping here. You're going home. What are you gonna do about it? Goodnight. Out. - Cheerio, au revoir. - Goodnight. Go. What's that sad music? I want to cry. Yeah, I think that this town has a bit of sadness to it. I mean, people are... I don't know if they're depressed but they're sad. No one wants to sit there and look at them when they feel sorry for themselves. There's a lot of traffic today. No one stays here, but no wonder. Who wants to stay here? I think you should make it. You should make a documentary from... Can I have four Zambuccas, please? - Gotta have meat on her bones. - They're Lina and Steph. No, I don't give a fuck. They're fuckin' new ones. - Poor little things. - Oh, not that old cockhead. Fuckin' cunt of a thing. Oh! Get fucked. You have to put ice in it. Go and ask her. - Robin's got him under control. - Oh yes. Look out! See, you don't need a bouncer at the Denver City. Fuck you. Fuck ya. We're alright. Tell our mothers we're alright. - No, I can walk home. Fuck you. - We're goin' up bush. - We're goin'. - Hey hey hey hey! Hey, Sambucca time. Oh no, we're back. That's what I was gonna say you know how you have Good Friday off? Do you wanna do something? What? You, me, Dave and Steph. Camping. - Camping. - Yeah, it's like 70ks from here. It's like the water there and you got barbecue, bathrooms and you have fires and stuff. Drink, play cards, marshmallows. It's Easter. We can only get Easter eggs. It'll be funny. - Who're you going with? - I don't know. - Are you going camping? - Yeah. No, we're going with Anthony and Dave who works at the motel. Spiders and snakes. - The boys from the motel. - Oh yeah. And then our friend is coming to visit us. We'll text you the name where you can get off the train. Yeah, see you tomorrow. Probably have to go camping even if James isn't coming because the boys are talking about it all the time. It's like to be on a double date if it's just like these two guys and me and Lina. So it's good if James is coming because if we have to sleep in a tent he's going to sleep in the middle. I mean, the guys are really stupid if they think that a camping trip means like gang bangs and whatever. I don't know what they're thinking but they're really stupid if they think a camping trip means that. Meet us tomorrow morning at half past five. But it's after twelve anyway, so... - Yeah. - We'll be right. Nah, fuck that. I need a good night's sleep. Every night, like we finish at seven. They're going out in the middle of the bush. - With Dave from... - Jamie. - Dave, with - Oh yeah. Okay. Steph. Come and talk to me. - You want a bit of rope? - Yeah. Tie it around and you can tie the knot. So nobody knows how to undo it. What are we gonna do with the rope? Tie your legs together. Why? You're going out with these deviants, mate. Well fuckin' tie them up. He's gettin' in between your legs, mate. That's just what I'm saying. I'll give you some rope so you can tie 'em together. - Hey? - No. No. - It's all good? - No worries. All good. I'm only trying to look after you, mate. Don't want you to go home to fuckin' Finland with any babies. Drinking games. - Straight up the stairs, mate. - Sweet. - Hey! - Hello. - Ohh. - Hello. Heeey! I was sure that you were not going to get that train. This is it? This is it. It's not open today. No. Tomorrow. James, James, James, James, a surprise for you. - What is it? - You're welcome. And that as well. You're welcome. - And Anthony, James. - James, how are you man? - You all right? - Yeah, good. But I haven't now. I just got it back. Oh, fuck me dead. Well what the fuck are we doing here? I thought it was a nice place. So we're gonna smash some vodka Red Bulls. Fucking one day off with Stephie. This is just what we were dreaming of. I've had enough of all the drunks. Now I want to get drunk. And he used to get these hot chicks, eh. Old MILFs that are just like toey as. He was banging this chick for ages. She'd still pay him. So he never did the pool? Just come round and rooted her? Oh, and maybe clean the filter out. He'd just smash her for like three hours. Good work if you can get it. Whoop. - Whoop? - Whoop. You have to bet whether it will be in between the five and the King. - Oh yeah. - Yeah. And you can bet drinks. So she's got three drinks to choose who drinks them. So you just skull it like four times. What if you start by saying a card each, black or red. This is when you take your top off. Girls don't have to take clothes off. I'm not playing. - How do you play your game? - Just fuckin' do it. - Me? - Drink. Alright. Drink. - Drink! - Oh I didn't do it, did I? When he's sitting down in the bar he's always screaming to you. Like, what the fuck? Fucking idiots. You're fucking useless. I hate him so much. Pikey, he's blaming being single because he doesn't have a car. And that's not the fucking reason. He's like, 'hey bitch!' Staring at my ass in the bar. You haven't even got an arse. - Stephanie's got an arse. - Yeah, you don't have an arse. You got no junk in the trunk. Do you girls have boyfriends? - Yeah, a lot of boyfriends. - Yeah. - So I'm your Welsh boyfriend? - No you're not. You're just a friend. I should just go home now. When you walk away from them they're like whistling. And they're like screaming their, I don't know, disgusting things. What do you think of Australian guys that you've met? When they're not standing behind the bar doing this, ooh, ooh, ooh! -When you live in a town where- -Especially when full of miners. - Then it is. - Yeah, that's the thing. You're here in Coolgardie. Everyone we spoke to told you how it was going to be. And we have to live with all the people that has alcohol problems. Drinking until they're drunk enough so that we cut them off. We're sending them home, they're 'well fuck off, fucking bitch.' Have you cut me off? - Yeah I have. - Yeah. I don't stress about it. Just let it go. Don't listen to them. Yeah, here's a drink. 'Give me the fuckin' money.' Ohh. Good morning, ladies. - You feeling good? - No. Well you probably gonna start feeling worse now. Wakey wakey. How are you, Stephie? My head... Bad blisters. You know when you have done something when you are drunk and you wake up the next morning. You just feel like you want to dig a hole to yourself. And I was so drunk so that I couldn't understand anything. I said they're stupid if they think something's gonna happen. Seven, eight, nine weeks left. This guy said that we have to stay here for three months and that's like the deal. But no longer. We have to save money. That's why we are here. Okay. Righto. So you've been here for four weeks. - You should have noticed that. - Okay. When you're doin' fuckin' nothin' all day you should be learning how to do this shit. That's it, now move. Come on, bring it to me! - That's it. - That's it. That's it. They're only here for one reason, they need the money. Yeah. Pike-o! These bastards have been here for four fuckin' weeks, mate. They stand around all day doin' fuck all. But they just don't seem to want to be involved with anybody apart from the Canman. Well fuck them, mate. I give them a fuckin' chance. We went camping and she got like big blisters on her toes. So after that she got like really high fever. They're really nice. I have to go to the bar later. After an hour. So Stephie can eat. Then I'm going back to bed. Good evening. How're you going, madam? Very sick. Do you want anything to eat? Yeah, I have to eat, so, yeah. - Okay. - I'm coming down. - That's a yes. - Yes. Okay. No worries. - Alright? - Yeah. You're really sick. Not enough chocolates. Who's that? People can't just come up here. Hey! Hey. Hmm? We don't usually have our customers on our couch. Okay. - I do. - That's nice. Hmm? Are you staying here? No. No. No! Oh God damn it. What? Jesus. Have fun. - Huh? - What? What? Huh? What? Goodnight. I went to the medical centre this morning to get some antibiotics and I have to go back to the centre in a couple of hours. Hopefully getting better soon, because I can't work. I have an infection, around my lungs or something. Hi. - Um... - Stay away from me. They're sending me to the hospital now but I don't know when I'm getting back. - You don't know which? - When I'm getting back. Oh well, we'll sort that out. You gotta get better first. That's the main thing. What was your name? - Gina. - Lina. Lina's in hospital and here are people who could take me but 99 percent of them Lina don't want to see right now. I know she don't want to see Pikey and he offered the lift. She don't want to see Anthony. And I know she don't want to see Jamie. And... yeah. So... Gotta talk to you, Steph. Hi. This is going to be your last shift today. Got the horrible job of telling you. Dunno why they asked me. But Peter, ah, as you know he's the man. Yeah. And he's not happy with you. Doesn't think you're suited. Okay. I don't think you want to be here anyway, do you? - Yeah. - Hey? But like I said, they've given me the job to tell you which is I don't like anyone losing your job, but... I don't think you're really suited to it either. You know, you just seem like you're not interested. Yeah. But ah... so... - Talk to Tony and Leone. - Yeah. 'Cause they're going back to Perth next Tuesday. So whether you want to stay until then. And then give you a lift back to Perth or wait and see what happens to Lina. Okay. - So alright? - Yeah. - Sorry, but that's... - Well, what's there to do? Like I say, it's Peter's decision, and he's the man who pays the bills, so... Okay. So I just hope everything works out alright for you and Lina. Sorry mate. We going to the hospital, are we? Can you put the car on so I can open the window? Canman. No, Mum! Mum, it's fuckin'... Yeah, it was a pretty short conversation. 24th of July. Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. It was nice to meet you. That's alright. - See ya. - See ya. - Look after yourself. - Thank you. And what I need is two to take their place probably about 25, 26. Have you got anybody there? - Hi. - Hello girls, how're you going? - Hello, good thank you. - Have a seat. I do think you two could be a good fit for some country pub work. Now the one that I would have in mind for the two of you is actually in Coolgardie, which is a mining area. As long as you're up for something that's a bit different. It's a relatively small town. It's got a petrol station, roadhouse, a couple of shops. So we're here in Perth. Kalgoorlie's here and then Coolgardie is here. So it's not going to be... You know, it's not Perth.
