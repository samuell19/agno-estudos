Happy birthday. Wish you a year full of love. Thank you, Adi. I knew you'd be the first one to call me. How did you know? I just knew it. By the way, I'm standing in the middle of a park, wishing you at midnight. You could've said something better than, "Thank you." What did you want to hear? Just three words. -One of them starting with-- -Shit! Adi, Papa's calling. I'll hang up now. He'll nag me about who I was talking to at midnight. So, tell him. Right.

Say, "Disconnect the call." Fine, disconnect the call. You're the one who has to go. You should hang up. The call got disconnected. He's gonna nag me. Tell him you were talking to your boyfriend.

Now drive, and turn on the bloody AC! He's not gonna do anything. -You don't have to be scared. -Come on! Come on, we don't have time. Look… If I get dengue or corona, I'll make you pay all my bills.

Don't you get Vividh Bharti on this radio? I don't know, sir. Why are the flowers here? Happy birthday, Ne-- Neha? The name of my neighbor's daughter is Neha as well. But she's a cultured girl. Why didn't you tell me it's your birthday? You see, it was Neha's birthday… Stop it. Sure. Happy birthday to you. So, how old are you? Age? How old are you? 18? I've turned 18… What should I do? My clothes have shrunk! -What should I do? -Tell me. How old are you now? -Come on, talk to me. -Nineteen, sir. Are you her lawyer? Come on, man! Let her speak. My clothes have shrunk! What should I do? Go see a bloody tailor! Look at this, Patil. Mr. Baahubali has created a wall with his hand. That's not a line you should cross! He's scared. If he moves his hand she will jump into your lap. Come on, man! Drive! What… are you wearing around your neck? What is it? Is it a locket? Let me see. Let me see. -What is this-- -What are you doing, sir? Get lost. Sir… Whose locket is it? Let me see it. What is it? It's a religious locket. She's religious but not in a parking lot! Don't you have a tattoo? It's the latest fashion these days, getting tattoos of each other's names. What happened? Sir… ATM. Already? Sir, how much should I withdraw? Fifty! Not possible, sir. The card has a limit. How much? Sir, 30,000 maximum, sir. So, five and 30 more, that makes it 35. -35,000. -Fine! I'll give you a student concession. Go on. I'll just come, okay? Hey, you go, bro! Swag! She's okay! Chill! Go. Ma'am, this is a dangerous place. -Tell her about the white Innova case. -What case? Yeah, that. What happened to the girl was really terrible. You tell her what happened. Tell her. She was your age. Some loser like him had brought her here. Suddenly some men attacked them and the guy ran away. Oh, fuck, man! I hope those are all 2000-rupee notes. Sir, the machine isn't working. Damn! Come on, get in. It's gonna be a long night. And maybe I might let you go for free if my mood changes. Right? Come on. Let's go. Put on some music. Why play the radio? He'll sing himself. Hey, hero! Sing some nice English songs. What's wrong? Can't sing? How the hell did you impress her? You're so useless.

Call your father! -Call your father! -Sir… Does your father know you're with him? Does he? Sir, please. They live in Jaipur, sir. They are very orthodox. It will be a problem, sir. They should know what their daughter is doing in the city! -Let it go, sir. -Please. -What's in it? What's in the bag? -Please stop, sir. -Give me the bag! -Please stop, sir. -Is it a condom? -Leave her alone, sir. Which condom is it? -What is it? -Sir, please. But we had canceled it, right? -I said leave her alone! -Hey, what-- -What are you doing? -What will you do?! -You're hitting a cop! -Take us to the police station, right? -Sir! -Let's go. Let's go to the cops. -Hey! -No! Sir… There… that's the beat van. Do you want to get in? Have you experienced a lockup before? -From the inside? -No, sir. I'll show you today. -No… -I'll charge you with rape. And you… Your father will take the first flight out here. He'll sit outside the police station all day and face the media! You'll be famous in Jaipur overnight. -No… -Do you want to go? Do you? What's going on there? Sir… -Sir… -Sir, please… Sorry, sir. Sorry… sir… The time for "sorry" is over.

Let's go. I am feeling… a bit dizzy right now. The party's just started, Patil. I can't reverse. Sit. It's good you got back in the car. Otherwise, they were going to arrest you. But I told them, "They're innocent. Let them go." Why make a scene? Right? Come on, hurry up and get the money from an ATM. Let's go. Hey, assho-- Drive carefully! What the hell! He's got all we need for a party! Does he have a beer? Nope. It's soft drink. Nice. What else? Chips! Chips? Want some, hero? Glutton! What more do we have here? Oh, it's Melty! My favorite.

We're not a musical troupe where everyone goes together. Go on. You know what, take the keys with you. But if you take the keys, you'll switch off the AC, right? And… Ms. Neha will start sweating. She might feel hot… and her dress will become wet, right? I'll keep the door open and wait outside. Okay. Go on. Patil, go with him. Why? Why me? What if he runs away? Go on. -Let's go, come on. -Sir… Come on, let's go. She is safe. Come on. It's late. Come on. Go on. Come on. Let's go. May I do it? I've never done it. Please! 1-9-9-1! What's wrong? Did I delete it? -Let me count it. -It's the right amount, sir. -What if it isn't? -It's always the right amount. People can't be trusted and this is a machine. Sir, it's correct-- Sir! Sir! Sir, open the door! Sir! Sir! I guess she's never met a real man before! What did you do? What did I do? We were just talking. Come on, Patil! Right, Neha? Stop it, dumbass! You're stressing her out! Neha, are you okay? She was smiling a few moments ago! This Devdas ruined her mood! Right, Neha? What? What? You've never done this before. What the hell is going on? What are you saying? She is my sister. I know you're out of your mind today! I'm drunk but you're the one who's high. Listen to me! Just give me my share and I'll push off. Wait. No. Hey, hero, come out! -Come out.

Here you go. Come on. You wanna leave, right? Take one! Come on! Good boy. Can we leave, sir? Well, money isn't important, but we're celebrating the Ganesha festival next week… and I'm a little short on cash. So, you're basically just lending me some money. Okay? Alright, scram. -Sir… -What? -You have my phone. -Yeah! Here you go! Take it! Scram! Hey, stop! Give me your number. I'll need it if I want to return your money, right?

Take the freeway, alright? It will be safer. And don't stop the car. You won't always run into a gentleman like me. Right, Sister Neha? Hey, why don't you sit in the front? What? You don't wanna sit with him anymore? Fine, do as you please. Take care. Take care. Go on. Scram! Get lost. Neha… At the ATM… What happened in the car? Neha. Neha, please. Did he… do something? Please, tell me. I need to know. Please. Please, tell me. I need to know as a man, okay? Man? -Adi… -Don't. Don't. Adi, listen… Do you have a list of things we need to buy? Yes, Mom. I have it! I keep forgetting. Listen, the blue dress… Mom, I won't wear the blue dress. Fine, don't wear it. But you could at least try it? -It's very cute. -Mom, I know all your tricks, alright? First, you'll make me wear the dress, then you'll say, "Wow! My daughter is looking really beautiful!" -I'll take a stump and shove it up-- -Pattu! What happened? Nothing, sis. I just had a minor accident. You should be more careful, son. Why are you always in a hurry? And listen, try some turmeric milk. It helps in healing the injuries. Yes, Auntie. I'll tell Mom about it. Okay. -Let's go. -Take care. Yes, sis. Adi… What would you have done if he had insulted your sister? Adi! He really is a learner. A real learner. I don't get it Where did I go wrong? Why is my heart on fire? Why is there smoke all around? One doesn't change the way you did Why did you do this to me? Why did you do this to me? Why did you do this to me? Why did you do this to me? I wish no one feels as lonely as me The world's against me And none of this is my fault This is love… If this is love… Then why fall in love? I am upset… There's nothing to hide Why did you do this to me? Why did you do this to me? Why did you do this to me? Why did you do this to me? 1,050 rupees! You're 30 rupees short. Ma'am, what are you doing? Move on. It's getting late. Uncle, just two minutes. It's almost done. You can try this tea if you don't really care about the brand. You will get a free soap as well! You won't need this. And instead of buying three separate brushes, buy a pack of three. It's cheaper. You get one rupee back. Thank you. Do you have a bag? -No. -It's alright. You call this tea? Did you drop a sack of sugar in it? Watch the sugar, man! Have you read this? A chemist shot his own brother in Andheri. In broad daylight! -Shot him four times in his own home. -I know. -Are you serious? -Yeah. How did a chemist get a gun? What the hell, man! Siblings are killing each other, and you're worried about the gun? Dumbass! It isn't a trivial case! -What? -Yes. Hey… hero! Hey! Hey! Haven't you seen the video on WhatsApp? Hey, hold it! Who is he, Mangya? He's a friend. I'll be back. Hey, hero! How are you? Open up! Come on! What brings you here? Are you alone? Hey! What the-- Open up. Come on, bro! You bloody… Why are you playing with your window? You think this is a game? I love games. What brings you here today, hero? And… how is Sister Neha? I have sent you a ton of good jokes. Did you read them? Well, you've changed your look! You're not a cop? Yeah, I'm not a cop, but the citizens should be alert as well, right? Cops can't handle everything, right? What? You're giving me a death stare. Are you trying to threaten me? Tell me. Sir… Yeah, that's right! We're back to "Sir"! I had told you to stay away from this place, right? You had? I had, right? Anyway, I'm telling you right now. Stay away from this place! If I see you here again, I'll beat you to a pulp and get you admitted into this hospital. Are you getting me? Now get lost! Okay, sir. I'll go. Get lost. Buzz off! Mangya, what happened? Nothing… You have a drilling machine, right? -Yes. -I need it. I'll lend it to you. Let's meet at our usual hangout tonight. I'll bring it with me. Not today, man. It's the Ganesh Festival. It's a dry day. I'm taking my family to the Evershine Ganpati Pandal. Yeah, I've heard about the Evershine Ganpati Pandal as well! They say it's amazing. Really fantastic. Really? Mangya, is he really a friend? Why? No, I'm not really getting a friendly vibe. Vibe-- Do you want me to sing a song for your vibe? -I won't break this friendship! -Look at him. Dumbass! Come on, give me a cigarette. I don't have one. Hey! Get me a cup of tea as well. Wow! It's really heavy. Are you getting married? What?! My daughter's getting married! Well, I just asked because few lucky ones get married twice, sister. Stop calling me "sister" and do your job. -Or I'll go to some other tailor. -Come on! I'm here for you! -Tomorrow at 4:00 p.m. -Where? Make sure this is ready! -Yes. -"Where?" Idiot! What do you want? What do you want? Is this a tailor shop? Does this look like a sweet shop to you? It is a tailor shop. You? Your sister is getting married, right? Do you want a suit for yourself? I'm a Bandhgala suit specialist. Really? But it's already over. -Your sister got married? -Yes. That's exactly what I was waiting for. What do you mean? Hey! Move, dumbass! Boss, where does Mangesh Jadhav live? Mangesh Jadhav? The guy who drives an ambulance for Paramount hospital. It's house number 30. Right next to the temple. -That way? -Yes. Thank you. Yeah, I'm coming. Hello, ma'am. Is Mangesh home? No, he's on duty at the hospital. You are? He hasn't returned yet? He told me he'd be back by 4:30. No. Who are you? Actually, he had called me. I have a meeting with him. Meeting? What do you mean? Supratech Solutions, ma'am. We're actually looking for a private ambulance service. We had spoken about it. And he had asked me to come home. Try calling him. I would've called, but my phone's battery just died. It's alright. I'll wait for him… outside. Come in. Please come in. Thanks. Keep your shoes outside. Sure. I hope I'm not disturbing you. No. It's okay. Please continue. No, we were about to leave anyway. We were gonna visit the Evershine Ganpati Pandal. Yeah… Sorry, I'll wrap this up quickly. We'll immediately discuss the details once Mangesh is back and I'll be on my way. It's okay. I'll try calling him from my phone. Ma'am, actually Mangesh doesn't know it, but our company is signing a two-year contract with him. Please, allow me. I'll call him. It's busy. I guess, he'll call back. Can I get some water? Oh, I'm really sorry. Thanks. -Regular water, please. -Yes. Did she run away? Rani? -Rani? -The cat. Yes, she… She is really restless. She always runs out when the door's ajar. Leave it open, she will come back. Sure. Please sit. Yeah, sure. Arhan Khan, who's already struggling with #maalofmanali drug scandal, is now stuck in another sensational case. Should I change the channel? No, ma'am, please sit. No, I need to take care of some chores in the kitchen. Please sit. The Arhan Khan case isn't cooling down, huh? He's having an affair with Pasha's sister. Are you serious? They claim that he'd also made a deal to buy some RDX! Arhan had imported this car from Dubai's Pasha. What the hell is going on these days? Right? Ma'am, you work at Zidaa Mart? Yes, at the counter. We buy all our groceries at Zidaa Mart! -Really? -What a coincidence! And today? Took half a day off for the Ganesh Festival. Lucky me. Otherwise, I would be standing outside in the heat, right? We never get a holiday. -What does your company do? -IT. -Computer? -Yes. But ambulance? That must be Mr. Devram's car. I think he's here. Chhaya, are you coming to Evershine? You go ahead. Riya isn't home yet. I'll come with my husband. Alright, see you. It's getting pretty late. Want some tea? No, thank you. Where can I keep this glass? -I'll keep it. -No, please, let me. -No, I'll keep it. -Please, just tell me. Please-- Oh, shi-- Oh, shit! Sorry. Move. Your sari is drenched. I told you I'll keep it. No, you have to go to the temple and I-- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, ma'am. Oh, shit… Hurt yourself, right? Yeah. Look! I'll give you some bandages. No, ma'am. It's okay. But… so sweet. Hello? I'll call you back, sis. I'm busy. Yeah, okay, bye. You told me your phone battery was dead? Dead? I had used up my phone balance. I couldn't call anyone. Yes. Where did he keep my phone? Ma'am! It stopped. My phone was right here. I'll try calling him again. The door… Ma'am, here's your phone. No, this is the TV remote. -Look, if you have my phone-- -Ma'am… Look! I have an iPhone. Why would I take your phone? Give me your number. I'll try calling. First, you told me your phone's battery was dead. Then you said you didn't have enough balance. And now you wanna try calling me? Emergency balance, ma'am. He's back. -Mom! -Riya, you're back, sweetheart? Who is he? Hi. So, you are Riya! You are really cute! Where are you coming from? Tuitions? Which class? -4A! -4A?! Riya, go have some poha. -Yes. Where is Rani? -Outside. She will be back soon. Ma'am, she is really cute. Just like you, I swear. -Same to same. -I think he'll be late. You should leave. I could've left a long time ago. Trust me. But the company has a deadline. I have to meet Mangesh today. It's a two-year contract, ma'am. Ma'am, you had asked if I wanted some tea, right? Please. Meanwhile, I'll look for your phone. We were standing here when I took it from you. And then… It could be here. Extra sugar, ma'am! Uncle, what are you drawing? Why should I tell you? Please. No. Tell me! Who is it? Dad! Papa? Ma'am, I found your phone. It was right here, behind the cushion. Thank you, ma'am. What does the red sari indicate? -Volume. -Please stay with us. -Yes. -We'll be back after a short break… to discuss Arhan Khan's sensational case, that involves drugs, -Lower it. -cars, terrorism, and… Hello. Where are you? Someone's here to meet you. Yes. He's just around the corner. He'll be here soon. Come, Riya, get dressed. Dad will be home soon. The tea is amazing, ma'am. We're leaving soon. Mom, I want a new drawing book. I'll get one. Stand straight. Mom, look at what he drew! How dare you enter my kitchen! Get out! I am sorry. I wasn't supposed to? But it's amazing, ma'am. Please share the recipe. What is this? Caricature, ma'am. It's just a drawing. It's a joke, ma'am. Don't take it seriously. Alright. I'm gonna tell him everything when he comes home! What? Let him come. Rascal, how dare you come into my house? I did apologize. You wanna meet my husband, right? Meet him outside. Get out of my house. I'll call the neighbors. And what about the two-year contract? If Mangesh finds out… Fine, I'll tell him everything as well! I said I'm busy right now. I'll call back. You don't fucking understand or what? Mom… Sorry, ma'am. I get irritated because they keep calling me. Ma'am, let bygones be bygones. Let's forget what happened. Let's make a fresh-- Wait a second. You loon! Get out! What does "Loon" mean? Are you crazy? Just get rid of this drawing, Riya. Very bad drawing, okay? Give it back. -Hey, Chhaya. -Ma'am! Who is it? What's wrong? That was fun, ma'am. Sir… Ma'am, I loved it. What are you doing here? Do you know him? I've been asking him to leave. You did? Oh, yes, we've been waiting for you, sir. Who gave you my address? Mangya, who is he? -He told me you called him. -Why would I-- Sir, she's a bit furious. You see, ma'am and I… I accidentally wet her sari. It's just water, sir. Get changed, ma'am. Let your dad see the drawing, sweetheart. Show him. Bastard! -Just get him out of my house! -What? Ma'am? Why don't you tell her how we know each other? Tell her, sir. -Whoever you are, just get out. -But, sir-- Let's talk outside. Come on. It's very hot outside, sir. She will start sweating, right? -But who is he, Mangya? -I'm a friend, ma'am. Best friend. He texts me some amazing jokes. -Get out. -Papa! Hey, you-- -Don't be scared. I'm here for you. -But-- -You're the one who is scared, sir. -Me? I'm scared of you? -I'll show you-- -Dad! -Mangesh. -No, sir. Don't show me, sir! Show her. Show her the "real life". Come on. To hell with you! Get lost! Mangesh, what are you doing? I beg you! Please leave. -Do you wanna get thrashed? -It's okay, ma'am. Real life is tough, sir. Wow! But behaving like this in front of the child… She's scared of you. She was happy before you got here. Stop blabbering and get out. -Sir, please. -Dad! -Riya, call your uncle. -Yeah, call them. -Don't call anyone. -Why, sir? Right, yes, you're a cop. What is he saying? Nothing. He's a lunatic. Didn't he tell you? -You… -Sir. Social distancing, sir. Come on. What are you doing? I just want to talk for five minutes. I don't want you here for a bloody second. Get lost! -I am going, sir. -Leave. -I am going, sir. -Go. Just wearing my shoes. -It's okay. -Dad! -Stop crying. -But… not fair, sir. Firstly, I drove all the way here. Did you know that one needs a visa to come here from Malad? From Mith Chowky! Remember? Jab We Mith. Good one. Just get lost! I'm leaving, sir. Come on, leave. But before I leave, I got this for your daughter. -You're crossing the line! -Dad! What's wrong, sir? Are you in a bad mood? You couldn't stop licking it the other night! Which night? I think he's embarrassed, ma'am. Don't worry, I'll tell you! -Hey! You're not gonna say a word! -Come on. -Just get lost! -Come on! Why are you in a hurry, sir? -It's gonna be a long night! -Get out-- -Hey! Hey! Sir, please… -Wait! -Ma'am, please tell him-- -Don't touch her! -Mangya, please. -Please what? Why the hell did you let him in? I didn't call him. I don't even know him. He's here for you! Are you gonna let every random stranger into the house? Mangya, stop screaming at me. What-- What do you mean? -What-- -Sir… I don't want you guys to fight because of me. It's not her fault. Mom! -But that was hard, sir. -It was, right? Do you want another? Get out. Ma'am, I've been here all evening. Did I ever misbehave with you? -Or with the child? -Hey! What? What? You've been yelling, "Get out!" all evening. I just wanna talk! I want to ask you something. I've been calling you "sir" all evening. But you're hitting me? Is this fair? Yes, it's fair. Now get out. You-- You've gotten into my head. I haven't slept for a week. My sister was getting married. But all I could think about was… Hey! What did you do to her? Ma'am, you tell me. Is this fair? Should I leave? Should I just leave after getting slapped by this swine? Tell me! Is it fucking fair?! -Tell me, bastard! -Hey! Move! -Hey! No! Stop! -Quiet. -No, no… -Just shut up! -Not Riya-- -Let her go! -Quiet. -Let her go! Mom! -No, please. -I'll stab her if anyone moves! -Sit! Come on! -Please! Riya… Answer me! -Please, don't hurt Riya-- -Stop screaming, "Please!" I told you! I just wanna talk! -Mom… -It's not my fault, okay? Your father hit me first. You saw it, right? -Right? -Mom! -Hey! Sit down! -Hey! I'm talking to you! What are you doing? -She's just a kid. A kid… -What? Hey! Alright, sorry, I'm sorry. Hey! It's okay! It's alright! We're playing a game, right? We're just playing a game. Your father was playing the cop that night, and I was the robber. He made me cry. I am the cop today, and your father's the robber. No, not a robber, he's a dog. Get out. Leave. Sir… Sir… Sir… Is he a loon? Why do you mean by "Leave"? It's time for… a song! The one from the car! Sing it. What? No? Ma'am… you look like you're smart. How did he impress you? Did you force her to marry you? -Did you… -Get out. Get out. Hey! Where were you hiding? Melty! Your favorite! Rukmini… What happened that night? I lost, you won… A driver posing as a cop Ma'am! -Don't… -Ma'am. Don't do it. One bite. Don't do it. -Ma'am! -Don't… -One bite. -Don't do it. Hey! Ma'am… for you. Hey! What? I'm being polite! Don't do it. One bite. Don't do it. I'm being really polite! Eat it. No? No. Hey! So, you won't you eat it? You won't? Motherfucker! What? Not cool anymore, bro? Yo! Swag! I won't spare you. You wanted to see my "manhood", right? Do you see it? Or do you want to see more? Had I known who you really are… I would've shown you my real manhood that night! -What would you do? -I would've shown it to Neha, not you-- The secret is out, bro. Mangya! -Dev-- -No… Hey, stop! Mangya! I've got the drilling machine for you. Hey, Mangya! I don't think they're home. Let's go! They must've gone to the Evershine Pandal. Let's go. I don't trust this Mangya at all. He must have gone out with some other girl. No way! Mangya's a changed man now. Balls! -What? -Come on… Uncle Kiran told us that he caught a couple in a parking lot last week And then… he and the girl… -Are you serious? -Yes. He's a bloody pervert. This is what I hate about Mangya. He's got such a fantastic chick at home, and he's horsing around for more. Hey! What do you mean by "Chick"? Call her Chhaya ma'am, alright? Hey! You can call her "ma'am". She's a gorgeous chick for me. -Hey, come on, guys. -Let's go. -Let's go grab a drink. Come on. -But the drilling-- Mangya. Let's get something to eat. But call her "ma'am", alright? Don't call her a chick. Look… they are gone. You should go as well. I won't do anything. Let's end this here. Go. No! What did he do to you? Why are you punishing him? -No-- Nothing… -Should I tell her? Go on! Tell-- Nothing-- Nothing happened. Really? Alright. We-- I saved you from the cops. I let you go. Yeah, I did… take some money. I'll return the money. Shove that money up your ass! What happened in the car? Say it! What? -Ma'am, come here. -Hey-- Let's hear it together. Come on. -Honestly… -Come on. Hey, Chhaya! Chhaya, where-- Why? Chhaya, I didn't do anything! Nothing happened. Really? Now tell us. I stopped the car outside the ATM, and you locked the car from the inside. What did you do to Neha? What? Say it! Nothing. Nothing. Really? Didn't seem like it. -Did you hold her like this? -Hey-- Tell me. No? Or did you touch her like this? Look, don't do it. Don't… Did you kiss her? Did you kiss her like this? -Hey! I beg you! -Did you kiss her? Let her go, man! I beg you! Forgive me, man! I told you I am sorry. What more do you want? I'm sorry, man! Hey! Rascal. The time to cry is over. The time to apologize is over as well. What did you do? What the hell did you do?! Tell me! I swear I will… -Hey! My daughter! -Mangya! If anything happens to Riya, I won't spare you! Mom! I'll tell you. I'll tell you. Chhaya… I did something terrible. What did you do? That's the truth. I swear on my daughter. Forgive me. Please. What if you catch another couple… in that parking lot again? I swear to God, I'll never do it again. Don't forget… that you're not the only man. There's someone out there, who can screw you in your own house. Are you getting me? Bloody coward. I'm sorry, ma'am. But if I hadn't done this, neither of us would've found peace. He deserved it. Right? Don't worry. You wanna leave, right? Come on! Cheer up! Smile. Please, sir. I won't take any money either. Happy? Well… just give me a kiss. -Just a kiss. -No, sir. Please. -He will never find out! -Sir, please. -Please, sir. Please… -Just one kiss-- -Just one kiss. Come on! -No, sir. Please… What the… Hey! Why are you crying? I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sir, open the door. Sir! Neha, we'll see you in college. Bye. I haven't seen him for a long time. Hi. You haven't returned my calls for a week. You haven't replied to my messages. Adi, what's going on? Adi… You wanted to know what happened in the car, right? I don't need to. Actually, I-- Sorry, buddy. I forgot you were in here. Hey! What? Forgive me, child. I'll never do it again. You're like my child. Forgive me, please. Please. Done? May I leave? Go! Where are we? Can you give me some money? How will I go home? I had warned Mangya not to push his luck! Adi, what-- Get in. Sit. -Adi, what's going on? I don't-- -This is nothing. I barged into Mangesh's home and taught him a lesson. That took care of his manhood! I had to prove it to you what a man I am. Look… I know what happened that night. You… did the right thing. It's all cool now, okay? Adi, wait. If he had done something to me that night, would things still be cool between us? I've been carrying your birthday gift around for a while. Do you want to see it? One second.
