Come on. Dude. (class quiets) (gentle music) You know what? Everybody close your books. Yep, close your books. We're gonna have a little discussion. By show of hands, how many people think they're from Africa? Ah, I won't take it. If you believe you're from Africa, lemme see your hand. Okay. Miya and Joe. Can you tell me why I didn't see your hands? - I don't know what country I'm from in Africa. All I know is America. I mean, like, I know my ancestors or whatever come from Africa, but I ain't African. On period. - [Girls] Period. - But do you even want to be African? - No. - Why? - I mean, like, I have my culture here. They have theirs over there. Why would I wanna be them? Like, Africans don't even fuck with us, for real. - Miya. - Lies. - Language. - My bad, Mr. F. - All right, Joe. - (chuckles) I'm from DC. How can I be from a place I never even been to? I mean, I fu- I mean, I mess with Africans. We all black, but we're not the same, though. - Well, you better watch how you talk about us, dude. - Okay, but wait, wait. Y'all really don't think we're the same. Like, our cultures really aren't that different. We probably have more in common than anything. - Girl, no we don't. She be doing the most. Just cause she hang around Africans, do not make her African. Like, okay, sing that African commercial with me. ♪ In the arms of an angel ♪ (girls laugh) - Hey, ladies. - Are you serious? - Come on, wait. No, no, no, ladies, come on, that's enough. - Y'all know y'all wrong. - Too much side chatter, let's move on. - Come on, you sound ignorant. - All right, that's good. - What you talking about? Are you gonna sit here and say you never seen those commercials with the babies, with the bees flying around they head? And telling us we can send 'em 10 cents a day to feed they whole village? - Come on, babe. - Just dumb. You really believe that? That's like me saying, "All black Americans are on drugs and welfare." - Exactly. - Not us. (class chattering) - All right, all right, wait, we need a break. All right, let's settle down. Settle down, all right? We are going to have a mature conversation here, today. Or we gonna have lunch detention. - What? (class groans) - It's a simple decision. Sit, wait, wait. Simple decision. Okay, all right, all right. All right. (class quiets) Hm. - Mr. F be trippin'. - Mm-hm. - I d e n t i t y. - He's a dentist? (laughter) - Might be detention? - [Class] Ohh, uh-oh. - Got him. - Whoo-whoo. - Identity. Determining characteristics which define what and who a person or thing is. So Joe, what's your identity? - My identity? - I mean, I'm black, you know what I'm saying? Yo, blackity-black. (laughs) - Alem, how 'bout you? - (exhales) I mean, I dunno. I was born here. My parents from Africa. So I guess I'm African American. - Okay. - Wait, wait, shh. Joe, back to you. Why aren't you African American? - I am. I was born here. I'm not African, though. - Okay, so, by that definition, if both of you were born in China, that make you Chinese? - What? - [Girl] Now he Chinese. - No. - That's a valid question, right? And don't get me wrong, I understand the confusion. I mean, typically, when we talk about "American," we speak of it as if it's an ethnicity. But the truth is, both of you are indigenous to Africa. And, therefore, you're Africans living in America. - We don't even know where we from. So what are you really claiming here? The whole continent? - Wait, gimme a second. I'm gonna get to that. Have any of you guys ever heard of the word "Akata?" - Hey, don't call me Akatist. - That sound like a disease. That's like calling me a nigga, but with an "er" on the end. - Julius. - I'm just saying. - Dude. - All right, all right, my fault. - All right? "Akata" comes from the Yoruba people, from Nigeria. In short, it means "a cat that has lost its way home." It's actually pretty endearing to the diaspora when you think about it. - Okay, but we still don't know where we're from, like. - Okay, what if I tell you most Africans don't know where they're from? - Man, that's cap! That's cap! They know where they from. Africa! - All right, everybody settle down, settle down. Seriously, look. - [Girl] Hello. - Let's walk through this, all right? Now, the truth of the matter is, those countries we know of, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Cameroon, none of that existed when our ancestors were taken. None of it. All that happened because the colonization of Africa. Millions, millions of people displaced. Now, unfortunately, in our own ignorance, we started to claim those lands. The lands that Europe sculpted. Not us, Europe. Sculpted by Europe. I mean, when you really look at it, we're all from West Africa, all of us. I mean, our cultures aren't really that different. It's a lot of similarities in there. I mean, the next time you really, really take a chance and, like, take some time and look at Africa, look at that coast. Look at that region. Understand that's you. That is yours, that belongs to you. I mean, don't get it twisted. Being from Africa has no bearing on where you're from, or where you live right now. I mean, look at your features. Look at 'em. Where do you think that comes from? - Yeah, this ass is definitely from the mother land. (class chatters) - That's my friend, for real. (bell rings) - Okay, all right. Everybody, don't forget, reports due on Monday. Have a great weekend. My Akata people. - [Girl #1] Y'all going to the party tonight? - [Girl #2] Yeah, that's where I'm going. - Hey, whoa, you two. Alem, Joe, have a seat. - [Girl #1] They gonna be playing them Afro leaks. - [Girl #2] I hope not, not all night. (students murmur) - So, y'all really were trying to fight in my class today. - Man, he came at me, man. What the f- - No. Really. Look, I'm not gonna suspend you. But you're both getting detention for a week, starting Monday, and I'm calling your parents. - Oh, come on, man! (Alem exhales) - Are we clear? Gentlemen, I need to hear you say it. Are we clear? - Yes. - Yes, sir. - Armstrong is shady. Guy, you should absolutely see Giota and Joe, they were just fighting in class. - What? - You see Giota and Joe, they just beat, beat, beat, beat. - Bruh. - Day, bah. You know when Joe put a forearm to the neck and like this. Like on this. - What? - I'm telling you! (laughs) - What? Never believe a nigga with no sleeves. They always up to something. - No sleeve? Boy, you like an assistant pastor and a gym teacher at the same time. (claps) (all laugh) - Bruh. Man, why you let Joe embarrass you like that? - Man, shut up! (laughter continues) - So now you are just raising sugar now. Because Joe is not here, and obviously you feel like da he. I will call Joe now, and he will hold you and slap living daylight out of you. He will beat (indistinct), come on your body. - Right, you know we just playing with you, man. Come on, man. Why you let Joe get you outta character like that? - Man, fuckin' with Joe, I probably can't even go to party tonight. - What? (phone ringing) (hip-hop music) (phone ringing) - Yeah, hello? - Hello? Mr. Fuka, hey, hi. This is Mr. Fomengia from Anthony Johnson High School. - Bro, he on the phone again. - Um, just calling to let you know that Alem had a bit of a dispute in my class today. - Bro, there's no reason why anybody should get you outta character like that, bro.

So please tell me why was he fighting? - [Irvin] Oh, this man on the phone again? - No, no, no, not a fight. He, he wasn't fighting, it wasn't a fight. He just had a bit of a disagreement with another student in the class. But, like I said, it was resolved. - Hm, I promise you, I don't know what to do with this boy again, though. Ever since he's been associating with those, (finger snaps) with those Akata boys, hm? He's been getting in trouble. - Wait, excuse me. - The fuck is "Akata?" - Irvin, will you sit back on that seat, please? - Yo, will you look at the road? - Irvin, will you sit back before I get a ticket? Come on, man. - Damn, man. - No, sorry, Mr. Fomengia. Sorry, oh, no, no. You ever seen the people on the street? You might be driving, and you just see people on the street up to no good, acting wild on, you know, street people? You know, street people? - Yeah, Mr. Fuka, I'm a little bit lost. I don't know what you mean by "Akata boys." - To clarify for you, Aka, Aka- You know us, we. We come to America to work and make money, period. They, they are born here, okay? They are born here with opportunities of a lifetime. But yet they do not wanna work hard like us. - Us? - Truly, on my way to work? - Yes, us Africans now. - And what about African Americans? What are they? Are they Africans here? - Listen, I did not say they are not Africans. All right, Mr. Fomengia. I did not say they are not Africans. - I'm not African. - But you see them. Can you put on your seatbelt, please? - Yo! The road, man! - Wait, hello, Mr. Fuka. - The road! - Your seatbelt on your belt, on your belt. - Your eyes, man. Why you watching me and not the road? Man. - On your seatbelt, please. - Bro, just let me out. - We are three blocks away.

I'm, I'm, you know, I'm at work. Listen, Mr- Ever since my son has been hanging with those, the kids in his school, they're up to no good. They might be doing drugs, gang related type of things. Hey, I've seen so many mugshots of people that look just like my son's friends. I can swear, it might even be them. Those type of Akata boys is what I'm talking about. - So the news? Okay, all right. So, you believe everything you hear on the news, Mr. Fuka? - (scoffs) It's the news. Of course, it's the news. - Yeah, this is the same country whose President said that we come from shithole countries. And that's who you're listening to? You're listening to them? Since when do we believe everything the news tells us? Especially, with the history of the media, and how they perpetuate, you know, negative stereotypes of Africans in America and across the diaspora. (turn signal clicking) Alem has every right, and should be proud to be African American. There's nothing else he should be teaching his friends about where he's from. (light guitar music) (woman vocalizing) - Mr., okay, Mr. Fomengia, it's not like I was- I wasn't belit- - Mr. Fuka, Mr. Fuka, Mr. Fuka, you know what? Maybe we should just talk another time. - Yeah, that'd be good. - Um, quiet. Okay, I mean. Oh God, okay. Thanks for, you know, taking your time and calling me. I really appreciate- I'll be sure to talk to Alem tonight. - [Mr. Fomengia] I appreciate that. - No problem. You see, we are here. I told you a few blocks away, you have no issues, so you- - Yeah, why is the door locked? - Because you've been behaving like an infant. - You've been driving like an infant. - You can't exit, please, and don't slam my door. Don't slam my door. (door slams) Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Please wait, sir. Sorry for the misunderstanding here. But please make sure I get my five stars, please.

What's going on? You tell me who. - I mean, Camille was cool. You know, I like her, you know what I'm saying? I think she still fuck with Joe. That bitch-ass nigga. (laughter) So I guess, I mean, I guess it's Mariama for me, you know. Feel like she just the one- - She is not your type, bro! (Turk laughs) She is not your type, bro. Stick with Camille. - Come on, man, you messing up the crib, yo. Yo, relax. - Hey bruh, hey bro. - Relax, bruh.

That didn't have nothing to do with me. - Sure. - It's Joe. He just be acting stupid sometimes. He just... - This is true. - But, so, we'll see. Do you like Alem? - Yeah. Like, he's a vibe, you know? But he be all up in your face, and you be all up in his. So, like... - Don't do that. - That's messy. - You know what type of guys Mariama like? - Whatever. - Turk, come on, man. It's Big Shug, man.

Act like you know what's up. - Wait, you hit her or something? - Well, well. I'm working on it. (laughs) - This nigga isn't even having it. - That explains it. Hey, you seen your boy today, right? Earlier, she was trying to talk to my man, right here. He all in the way, trying to get the attention. - Ooh? - Hey, you saw that, too, huh? - What are you? You were stuttering? "Can I g-g-get your n-n-nu-" (laughter) - Please, look. Mm-mm, don't know if I want him. I mean, he's cute, but he's goofy. - Ah, don't do him! (laughter) - Nuh-uh, nuh. - [Both] Ooie. (girls laugh) - Listen, Mari. Like, keep it a book. What's up with you and Shug? Forget the last one. Shug. - Yeah, fine. So, we be spending a lot of time together, you know. You know, just be up into each other and stuff. And he makes me feel so good, like. - Ahh. (laughs) That sounds like a zenny. - It's a big zenny. - Dudes. Dudes will have you like that. - Mm-hm. - But they will also disgrace you. - Mm. - Yes, they will disgrace you. - Mm-mm. - We're the ones that know how to play the game. - No, no, no, no. Look, we have a connection, okay? I mean, I don't care who he out here talking to. He not about to connect to them, the way he connects with me, right? - Connect Four. - Uh. - Things like that. - Oh my gosh. - Listen, listen. Mari, you remember dude I used to mess with around the joint? - Dude with the locks. Tony, right? - Useless Tony. - Oh, God. - Absolutely. Very useless human being. He used to make me feel amazing. But, like, he didn't really care about me, for real. I was all his, but he wasn't all mine. And it took me a long time to figure it out. And I still stayed like a stupid. But he didn't even know my favorite color. It was just sex. And that's cool, but that's not love. That's not love at all. - I mean, that's nice and all, but I know what I'm feeling. So, we be talking about it all the time, you know? I mean, we talk all the time. - About what, though? 'Cause I mean, like, you already told me how he just be telling you how sexy you are, and nada-nada-na. But, like, how is that any different from what Dina is saying? - (sighs) Yeah, but. Look, I know what I'm doing, y'all. Like, I know he cares about me. - Good, don't end up in McDonough. - Okay, look, bye, bye. - Uh-uh. - [Adina] Saying I'm messy. - So, what are we wearing tonight?

And I know why Joe probably don't like your ass. - I don't know, bro. - Remember that time Joe came to your house? (door knock) (door knock) - [David] Uh-uh, who's that? Who's that knocking at my door like the FBI? Can I help you? - Is Alem home? - Say what? - Is Alem home? - Who? - Alemanji, I came here to see Alem. - Alem is not seeing anybody right now. I just saw I'm running by- I got his, can you just tell got his back- - My friend, I told you Alem is not seeing anybody. Are you daft? And you wanna leave a message. Do I look like an answering machine? - Nah, man, you don't. - If you wanna leave something, leave this place. - All right, you got it, bro. - Leave. Huh? Nose ring is his nose, like Tupac. But you look too stupid. Unsavory character. Idiot.

Where did you put the keys? - Oh, the keys? - Mm-hm. - Put them on my head. Hm, and Esther? - Mm? - Speaking about work. Must we always bathe with hot water? Heh? Look at the electricity bill. 150 American dollars, for what? Comfort? Hm. - So let me see. So it's because of ordinary hot water. This is why you're making all this noise, huh? Do you think I'm from the village, like you? I've been bathing in hot water since I was in (snaps) primary school. My compound even had a jacuzzi. - Hey, hey, ha! Jacuzzen, hm! If you mean that, that small puddle that was in the front of the compound. You know, that when it rain, that puddle here? That you and your siblings used to piss in? Even one time, I took a small shit. (mimics squirt) (both laugh) Then you can jacuzze. - Mm, see your life. Isn't it the same puddle that people were fetching water from, hm? Bushman. - Do you have to do me like this? Hey, I'm just joking with you. (both speak Amazonian) Hey, hey, hey, boy. Hey, reverse your life. Retract your life. Moonwalk back here. Micro idiot, huh? Look at you trying to sneak yourself around. Sneaking around the house as I'm enjoying my wife. My friend, remove that thing from your head. Eh? Remove that hood. Are you a hoodlum? - Hey, ma? - Yeah. - Where are we from? - What do you mean? - Thanks, Ma - You're welcome. - I mean, like, where are our people from? - You're from North Carolina. You know this. - Where do we "come" from? Like, you know, like, our ancestors. You know, that type of stuff. - Well, we're from West Africa, of course. Why all the sudden questions? - You know, no reason why. You know, I was just asking. - There's never no reason with you. What's wrong? - Okay, so, like, today in school, you know, some of the class was arguing about, like- - (clears throat) Were you fighting? - Nah, you know me, I be chilling. I wasn't, you know what I'm saying? But, like, Alem and some of the other kids got into a argument about, like, where they were from, whether they were American or African American. And, to me, they all sounded a bit confused. - Esther, let me tell you something. If somebody on the streets would've told me what I learned about this, your foolish son, I would never have believed them. Hm? I would never- Is this what we send you to school to do? To be a fighter? UFC. WWF. He wants to be (indistinct). He wants to be- What's that skinny boy from Australia? Israel Adesanya. Huh? - Look, Dad, I'm, I'm sorry. - Look, look that janitorial mop of yours, hm? Before I give you some backhand slaps to be sorry about. - But Dad, I- - Hee! This boy. Stop "But Daddying" me. Stop it. So, what's your fixation between "but" and "Daddy," huh? Hah, Esther. - Mm-hm. - This, this, your son. His behavior has been quite embarrassing. Quite embarrassing, quite embarrassing. (slurps) Mm? - David. The way you are devouring that fufu is embarrassing. The food is not running from you. - Esther, see. (loudly licks fingers) You're deflecting for your son. Don't deflect for your son in this moment, okay? His teacher called me today. And what's his name again? (finger snap) Ehh, Mr., Mr. from somewhere. What's, what's your teacher's name? - Mr. Fomengia. - Thank you very much. - Mr. From, em, From, From Jiva. The guy now called me as I was working. I had the passenger in the car. Don't get me wrong, though. I like the guy, a very smart man. But because of this idiot, he called me with a condescending tone. And it, quite frankly, it embarrassed the hell out of me. "Do you believe everything you watch on the news?" - [Esther] Mm-hm. - "And do you believe all the stereotypes that you did this and did that?" I mean, it was something that I never put into perspective. - Mm-hm. - But because this fool wants to be fighting, I mean, I was, I was- You know, I was embarrassed, to say the least. - Alem, what is going on? Why are you behaving like this? All this fighting. You will end up in jailo. - It wasn't even my fault, Ma - Esther, listen, this your son. He should be an example for his American friends. He should be a prime example, okay? These American children, they- Listen, all of them are not bad. They listen and understand it. But we must bring them together as Africans. We must come to our African American family and come together and move. But not like how this, your stupid son, is moving. - What do you mean? - What do I mean? What do I mean, Esther? He has more graffiti on his body than a subway in Harlem. (Esther chuckles) (sucks) I think it's time that we send this boy back home to finish school, like his brother, Atay. I did not come to this country for my children to be bringing shame on my name. Period. You're an African, behaving like this? - But I'm not African! And you tell me that all the time! I don't speak the language, I've never been there. Dad, you haven't taught me anything. So please, tell me what you want me to do. - First and foremost. - No. - Don't touch me! (African drums) First of all, you must bring that stupid tone of yours from 360 BPM. Walk it down to a 3. Am I your age, mate? Plus, if I teach you anything, you're just now gonna forget. Like everything your teachers teach you. Stupid fool! - It's okay. Alem, don't let me catch you speaking to your father like that again. You digress? Apologize and go to your room now! - I don't want an apology. - Sorry. - You know, he is right. We didn't take time to teach him when he was young. I don't want him looking at Amazonia like it's some type of punishment, hm? He doesn't know the language. Last time he went back home, he was three. I don't know, I just, I feel like sending him back to Amazonia now is not the answer. - Esther, do you want the culture to die with us? I mean, a dead culture is that what you want? - No, we can still try our best to teach him what we can. It may be too late to teach him the language. But everything else, there is still time for, hm? Anyway, I have to go to work, okay? - Mm-hm. - Let's not make it a big thing tonight. I beg, just let him be. - You are my boss. I'm his boss, but I know you're my boss. - Of course. - So anything you say goes. - Boss lady now. - Mm-hm, as long as you don't fire me from this job. - I won't. - As your husband. - Just be doing the right job. Do it clearly. - Good job, my car saver. And gas, you must put petrol in it. - Oh. - Sorry. - (indistinct) the gas, ah! - I was too hungry to stop at the petrol shop. At the gas station. - Okay, it's all right. - (slurps) Mm-hm. (door knock) - Alem, what's going on? Why were you fighting? - They stay coming for me, Ma. And to be honest, I ain't even start nothing, for real. Dude be talking about "Y'all live in huts." All this hoo-rah-rah-rah. Like, what? He came at me first. I really was just trying to defend myself. What you expect me to do? - Alem, it's not every time somebody says something to you that you must react. - Ma, I just feel like, like nobody really understands me. One minute, I'm African. Then the next, I'm not African enough. It be blowing me, for real. You got mad at Atay, shipped him off. And now you trying to do the same thing with me. - What do you mean, Alem? Being African isn't something that you carry in your pocket. It's who you are. - Okay, Ma. But they be blowing me, for real. I can't make this up. - Just ignore them. - That's easy for you to say. Matter of fact, why haven't you ever taught me the language? Or even just a little bit of pidgin? - (sighs) You know, we tried. But we didn't want to confuse you. - Confuse me? - We didn't want you to be mixing up your words in school. (chuckles, sighs) When your brother, Atay, was young, and we sent him to daycare, he would go to school and be saying, "I want sheet, I want sheet." (Esther laughs) The teachers will call us, angry, because all the other three year olds were saying, "I want sheet, I want sheet." We didn't want the same kind of things to happen to you. Look, Alem, don't worry, hm? We will talk some more later. I have to go to work. You know your dad is very angry. He's very upset. So please, I'm begging you, apologize to him in the morning.
