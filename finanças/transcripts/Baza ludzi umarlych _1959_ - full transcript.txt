The Depot of the Dead Why are you putting that in here? Damn you. You must fix it for tomorrow. I thought I'd freeze to death. Oh it's you Zabawa. You came back. How was it? I got stuck near Baligrod. You must weld these bars for me tomorrow. They've finished it off. When? Political police borrowed it for the commission yesterday. The troops had burned another village. Working all night? Stop kidding. Have you brought the new trucks? They will be here. So I won't fix this wreck if they are here. You look like a sitting duck. We all know that going there was a waste of time. It's easier for a peasant to get a horse from the UNRRA, than us to get a truck. Is the manager in? Yes Mr. Kowalski can I check the motor? OK There are no trucks, no spare parts, what is here? Men, sir You know what, that's what I've just thought. You must go there. Where? To the house on the scarp. The dead men's base? They aren't dead at all. They're alive and kicking. What's the matter? What are you doing there? Last month the attorney sent an order to arrest one of them, but the Police couldn't get there. And when they finally got there he was gone. Did he run away? Yes to heaven. Listen I don't want to tell you stories. We both know it's a forlorn land, awful roads and bandits from God knows where seeking amnesty there. Would anybody else go there? You? Are you serious? If they run away as they say, it will be the end for us. The phone is ringing off the hook. People have no timber for building, in mines, or even to heat their houses. You must go there... And instead of the trucks I'll get a kind word from you when I leave? That too... Stop kidding. I'm serious. You must go. There is nothing I must do. But I must send you over there. Somebody must make them stay there. So go yourself if you are as clever as that. All right I'll go. So what do you want from me? I know you must risk your own skin. I know, you have a home, a wife... But you will keep your flat. It's done. Give me that map. Take it, so you don't have any claims if you get killed somewhere at night. Warsawer? Yeah? What would you like to say at such a moment? What moment? When you fly down... Kiss my ass, all of you. You'd better think of something else. Why? You will have no time son. It must be quick. Go to hell. I've already buried two goners a third one can bring me bad luck. Did you bring the groundsheet? Damned, I forgot... I will not touch it with my bare hands. Won't you? I won't. As you wish Nine, but when your turn comes I won't lift a finger. You will go to heaven through wolves' stomachs. Take him Orsaczek... That was a nice crash. He tumbled down and lost his guts... What have you nicked? It brings luck. A mascot from a crash is a fluke. Remember Grzegorzewski always had one with him... To hell with him. He's already there. Shut up and pull. What do you think? The one in the box should be glad. It's the first time since he was a child he is on a sledge... You will find out when we pull you. Where are you going? To the base on the slope. You'll be amazed when you see that base... Where are the new trucks? There won't be any. So why the devil did you come here? To carry timber. Timber? And did you bring yourself a coffin? There are enough planks anyway... Come on, I'll show you that timber... Look, this one thought he could carry long timber on these wrecks also... Let's go. Damn him and his timber. We are leaving tomorrow. I'm fed up with these mountains. You must stay. Oh, must we? And who are you, pal? I've never seen you before and you are telling me I must stay. Whose order is that, yours? Mine. And who do you think you are? Are you a Pope or something? Shut up. They send me here to stay with you. We must carry the timber with these wrecks until the new trucks come. Who sent you? The Management. Oh, the Management sent you... That's very nice, timber must be carried with trucks. Let those who sent you come here and carry the timber on their own backs. Come on Orsaczek, you'll take the coffin to the town. Is he following us? Yes, he's already here. Instead of new trucks they sent us a spook. Don't you like his face? No, his scarf. Warsawer... That is the base. That one looks free? Wanda I brought another one with me. He's going to be here soon. He's filling the tank. What should I call you? Nine Is that your name? Listen they call me "Nine"for a long time. I was once in prison from paragraph 225. Do you know it? Murder That's right. If you add two and two and five, you will understand why they call me "Nine". I took him to the town. I thought we both go to hell. The wind's awful. Our new pal brought an assistant with him. He wants to commit a family suicide. Let him have it his way. Do you play, Warsawer? Yeah, wake Apostle, he had no luck recently... Hey Apostle, let's play. We're going to hell tomorrow anyway. Don't use such language. Is she your wife? Yes It's not good... As the Holy Bible says, the woman... the woman... shit after drinking my head is always as empty as a leaky bucket... but if I stopped drinking for a week or so I would remember it. Anyway it's something about a woman and it's very bad. Don't you remember? No He doesn't believe in God, he's a communist. And do you play cards? Poker? Yes. I can play with you. Well sit down. I'm opening for ten I'm in. That reminds me, the late pal owed me two hundred. He won't give it back now. Which late pal? Grzegorzewski Stefan. Didn't you know? Oh yes, you were drunk the whole time... Damn you Don't swear. When did this thief tumble down? What did you dream about during this time? God have mercy on him. Hey you, Nine keep your filthy hands on the table. Twenty and forty. I hope they will bury him as a Christian. Wait a moment, here he comes I think. Who? The new one, Partisan. Hey, what a nice cozy place... I brought four full barrels. We'll unload them tomorrow. Come on in. Just a moment, I must fix the tarpaulin. Put your cigarette out, when you are near gasoline. Are you frightened? I don't want to report to Heaven because of your cigarette. I've already seen a guy who played with matches and gasoline. He kicked the habit. Why? Because he kicked the bucket. Do you think you are clever? Well look. Put it out! Put it out! The barrel's getting hot. Wouldn't you put it out? No. Do you wish to die? Why do you talk about fear? What do you know about fear? I was in the woods through the whole war, and you talk such nonsense. Where were you? Near Kielce, Lublin, in the Kampinos forest, everywhere. What brought you here? The town is terribly boring, pal. There are only drinks and girls. The girls lie, and the drink gives you a headache. I tried to get in the Air Force, they refused me. The Navy wouldn't take me either... so I came here. It's difficult to earn something here. The trucks go to pieces, it's a fright to drive... So what are you here for? I see... Where would I find a better place to hide? Hey wait! Who is the one who has just come with his wife? Do you like her? I'm talking about him. She's pretty. His name is Zabawa. He used to work in garage. He's a good mechanic so they sent him here. Some people say it's because of her. They say she had an affair with a clerk. Can you imagine the rumor? VIP's wife and stuff like that? She learned everything during the occupation. She is nice. Hi! Hi! There is one there free for you. What do you have? I ask you damn you Full house jacks and queens. It's over. It's not poker at six It's a tough game I tell you. I once knew a guy who really understood poker. When he had a bad card he took out his gun. Do you think it's a correct method? What? A gun. We were talking about poker. It's a tough game. That's a pity we part tomorrow. We could play many interesting games. You must stay. If there were any new trucks they would have send them. There are none, absolutely none. Building sites stand idle for weeks without timber. You must understand. Don't waste your time talking Zabawa. Wanda, Wanda get up quietly and go out. I'll follow you. Wanda Come here Get up you'll help me. What do you want to do? Do you really want us to live here? Light When we were leaving you told me, everything will be different here, you said well, we will forget about the past. Our home and a new life, is this the home which you spoke about? Give me a screwdriver. I told you we shouldn't have come here. They are evil people. But they drive well. Don't you love me? Light. Why is it just you who must stay here? What's the good of talking about it all over again? Everybody has to mind his business anyway. Mine is timber. Is timber more important than me? The commitment is important. Don't you have commitment to me? Just as you towards me. Let's get away from here. Be careful... it's gasoline, you'll get blisters on your mouth. I'll leave... if you stay, I'll leave... Where will you go? We gave away the flat... Oh, I hate you... Light. Put it lower... they might see it. What are you doing? Tomorrow I'll return to the town. Do you hear me? Together with the men. I would rather go out in the street and on the corner than conk out here... I know what you want to do... you want to unwind the trucks. Pick up the light and be quiet. Why the hell are you waking me up? Are you in a hurry to a mass, you idiot? I want to wash up, is that so strange? Why today? It's our last day, isn't it? Today we are getting the hell out of here, gentlemen. Get dressed. What is it? I'm sorry baby but we all forgot how to act around women. We only sometimes dream of them lewd dreams, of course. God will punish you, beast. Don't stick your ass into my face when I am praying. Where is my eau de cologne? What's wrong? What do you mean what's wrong? I had a full bottle, and now? I don't know. You drank it all up, the day before yesterday when you were drunk, and you smelled so good... you said you add juice to vodka... Show me the juice now... Light-headed youngster, I drunk your water in order to protect you against temptations. Who did you want to please? Who us? No you wanted to go the town to practice filthy debauchery. Out. Anyway your water was awful, I thought my head would explode. Late Grzegorzewski God rest his soul, used a much better one. After his cologne I felt like a bird. Could you get out? She wants to get dressed. If you have done such a thing in the forest the boys would have settled their accounts with you otherwise... if you stole something from somebody. What do you say? Go to hell, you puppy. Hey, not puppy you old rot. Let me go. You will buy a quarter for what you've just said. Let me out Half a liter. Let... Liter. A whole big bottle Ok. Your word? Yes partisan's word of honor Oh, a partisan's... people get lost because of their weakness. If I had held him like that longer I could squeeze a whole case out of him. Well boys, lets start these damned wrecks. I had to do it. You know I had to do you want the management to think about me as an idiot. I had to. Why did you do that? You must stay. You disassemble the carburetors into little pieces. Do you want to keep us here? I'll do everything to keep you here. It won't work, we'll be on the move. They will give you the sack and you won't get a job. Stand still! You will stay. Your corpse will. And yours. You won't kill all of us. You haven't got enough bullets. There's one for each of you, and a whole bunch for you, Nine. Let's run away I'm scared. Of what? They will kill you. No, they won't. They will kill you, they will kill me, and they will kill themselves... Calm down Wanda Damn them and their smooching. Come on, boys, take your stuff, don't waste your time. Let's pack. What are you waiting for? We must stay, we must stay in spite of it all. There is nothing I must do. You will beg me to Must you go so quickly? Where do you hurry, damn you all. Yeah, where? We'll think about it in the town. It's only 30 km. I've never seen such a prat in all my life. It's because you've had a short life, Warsawer. Well, what is it? He isn't stupid. Who? Who? The idiot there. He'll put the carburetors together again and he'll drive our trucks. Really? And I've just repaired the pump... and fancy me just having repaired the pomp. It will work for a couple of weeks. It's truly a pity for the trucks. The beast will go and brag that he fixed up these wrecks. Holy shit! Do as you wish but I won't leave him my truck. Not me! Well what shall we do? I'll tell you something. A day sooner or later makes no difference. Let's put those carburetors together and we'll drive to the town in style. Okay? Sure, we'll go. You're good at throwing. I had time to learn it. I once hit the very middle of a car full of Germans driving at full speed. Your mum couldn't make a stew like that. I've got no mother. Somebody else, then. Who? Haven't you got anybody in your family who could cook up something fine? If I had, I wouldn't be here. And you, don't you want to go back to the town? And what? Marry, have children, take a walk arm in arm and save money for a new suit. No, that's not for me. It's better here. Didn't you hear what they say? What? You can die here. People die in town too. Hey! Will you be ready soon? He fooled us, nobody ever fooled me like that. Like what? Like a complete idiot. What about your father? Hey, Nine! I'll fix him tonight. He'll surely sleep with his gun, but I don't mind. I thought it all over. I'll just change beds with you. Give me your hand. What for? Give it! I'll take care of him myself. Don't mix it with him. I want to get him myself. But why? Are you interested in the widow? You gave me your hand that will do. As you wish. Give it to me. Is this yours? You shouldn't give back things when you find them. I'll bring you another one. Will you? What kind would you like? Here... a blue, green or yellow one? But you want to run away from here. Sure "alea jacta est" so do you want it back? Do you know Latin? And a couple of other things too. The riddle of life my dear. When do you leave? It's not so simple. Do you have a home in the town? I know what you're thinking about, baby, but it won't work with me. I only wanted you to give me a lift. Once in my life I took the wrong steps and since then I've been walking sideways. Boys! Buzka is coming! Who is he? The messenger from the company. Our pay. Aren't you working today? I looked for you out in the tree cutting place. Stop your babble, give us the money. Where did you get this chick from? She came with Zabawa. Is she nice? So what? Don't you know? No, I don't. Today I'm in a hurry but when I come here the next time I'll show you what. When do you want to fetch timber? We can try tomorrow. They won't agree, they'll fix the trucks and go to the town. They are getting their money now. How will you keep them? I don't know. You have until tomorrow morning. What can I do in a few hours? They will kill themselves on these wrecks... I see it and you know it too. I know one thing, I must carry down the timber. Have you finished? I think that will do. Start the motor. What for? We'll listen. It's no use. I'll drive around and try. Or would you like to drive along with me? All right, but first start the motor. I don't want us to get stuck somewhere. Don't worry about my truck. I'll take mine, you'll take yours. Do you want to take me sightseeing in the mountains? I'll try. All right I'll bring my coat. Warsawer, where are you going? For a little walk. Do you want to fix him now? You've taken too much brilliantine, you stink like a hairdresser but she doesn't like you anyway. It's a pity to look how they kill those trucks. When I'll have my own car I won't let anybody touch it. You should care for a car as for a child. You will have a piece of land not a car. Why a piece of land? Your own piece of land after your death. Play! Play! I'm playing and playing like an idiot and nobody pays me for it. Play! Play and sing. The harmonium quietly plays one two three everybody dances, but I don't... Stop it. Something else. Perhaps "the last Sunday"? All right but at once. Give me a cigarette. But you don't smoke. But now I want to. Listen, do you really want to run off? Where to? I don't know. Nobody knows that. What is it? Nothing, only wolves. Nothing to fear. There are worse things than that. What? A cold. Do you play the fool or are you really one? Would you like me to play a sage? It doesn't matter for me. All right, and now get away from here. Quick! Why? You remind me of something. Something unpleasant? Something I don't want to remember. What? Life. Take me away from here... there must be life somewhere... . people walking in the streets... lights... houses... Not now! Wait! Here he comes. Who? I can't say which one yet. And where is the other one? Far away. Holy shit, here they come, both if them. His pump went to pot. He 's learnt how to drive, but doesn't know yet how to care for his truck properly. The mountains are beautiful, I begin to like it here. I thought it would be worse. Don't worry boy, the first twenty-five years are always the most difficult. Why? Because then you'll understand that yobs who want to kill others usually have a bad ending. Apostle Let's play a good farewell poker. All right. Well? Come on Warsawer, it's the last time, perhaps you'll win back what you've lost. I'm in for a hundred. I add two hundred Two hundred for me. Two hundred and four hundred. I'll up it. Five hundred. Eight hundred. Eight hundred and one thousand six hundred. I'm in and checking. What have you got? Good cards, brother, I'm not bluffing, is a full house enough? Four of a kind. Lucky boy. Not as lucky as he thinks he is. Opening for a hundred. A hundred and two hundred. Two hundred and four hundred. Four hundred and eight hundred. Five hundred and a thousand. A thousand. Fifteen hundred. I'll leave the game. It costs two thousand. Two and four. I'll give four thousand. What have you got? A flush. Are you playing again? With what? Are you broke? That's too bad. But I'll give you a chance. Let's play for days. Days? What are you thinking about, Judas? I'll play with money but you guys with extra days working here. Ok? You can break your spine here every day. We'll give you such a funeral banquet that you won't regret it I'm playing, I can't come back flat broke to the town. Is everyone playing? Give the cards. Put down the cigarettes. One cigarette for one day. This is what it looks like. What? Life. It's not worth anything here. Play. What do you have? Jesus Christ, I've never seen such poker in my life. Man, are you a devil? Yeah, that was beautiful poker. Give me the cards. Do you want to play again? No, they are mine. I can buy them from you. They brought me luck. That's something. How much will you pay? Nothing, they are mine. I can buy them from you. No, they may bring me luck too. It would be worthwhile to have a close look how this luck looks like... No, it's not worthwhile. Are you afraid to frighten the good luck away? Good luck... I once knew a clever guy who was driving like a fool and wanted to make a fool of another guy. You are right... it was the greatest poker I've ever seen. Warsawer. I'll give you the money back. Not bad... marked... dotted cards... you played open. How could you remember all that? I was in jail once... I used to write long projects with this alphabet on cigarette paper. That was much more difficult than poker. What did they put you in for? Communism. Same as now. Have you been in jail for communism now? I'm here with you... it's worse than jail. How much do you want for shutting your mouth? Nothing. I'll stay to play an honest game with you. I only clean and clean your dirt. I can do without it. I'll clean it myself. Shall I help you, Nine? No thanks. Go with Warsawer, I'll catch up with you. Are you crying? No, It's good. When one can cry, one can start everything again. When will we leave? When? Today. Really? Get dressed. Well go and get dressed. I'll go to the forest now and take some timber. In that time you'll pack neatly, I'll come back before the others. We'll get into a car and tell the mountains "damn you" and then... And then what? Then we'll stay in the town for some time together... perhaps we'll get on well with each other... and then, you'll find yourself another fine guy and you'll go away with him. And you'll have a husband, a home, and everything and nothing. Why do you talk like that? I was kidding. Do you hear the wind? You won't hear it tomorrow any more. Dress up warm and wait. It blows terribly today. Nine... What is really your name? Nine. But your real name? I'll tell you when we get to the town. Orsaczek! What is it? Tell Marcinkowski I'll call on him today. Sure. Five lengths. Mr. Orsaczek why is it so little? I can't bring more, Mr. Marcinkowski, because he would know. Who? They've sent one. Who sent him? How could I know? They send whenever they want to. That makes... No, no Mr. Marcinkowski you promised me a car for a cab. When there'll be enough I'll come and get it. As you wish. Dealing with me is like with the bank. Nine will come here today. Hurry up boys, don't worry you'll get your car... a couple of drives more, and it will be done. Hey Nine, this is the Inspector from the Management. And this is another driver. Well, how is it? How is what? How the fuck are things? They are going, Sir Don't forget that we need timber. People are waiting for that timber. You work for the sake of men and men are our greatest wealth. Do you understand? Yes, Sir. See you later Sir. There is work waiting for me. Let the Holy Virgin bless you for your kind words, Sir. You have to know how to speak to people, just as I do. In our words, with an open heart, the fuck, and immediately I could communicate with him. Why doesn't he get promoted? There are some obstacles... What? He murdered wife's lover and they gave him 15 years. He was a doctor, but they took away his right to work. Yes... Yes. That's the obstacle... Very bad. Very bad... Mr. Five! Mr. Five! Not Five! Not Five! Pardon me but five is pimping... what is it? Will it be enough? Give me two lengths more. Why do you want so much? It's over eighteen. Eighteen is nothing, give me thirty. What? For such a road? You never wanted to take more than twenty. Men need that timber... they are waiting for that timber in factories, docks, the capital city and small villages are waiting to carve them into toothpicks and umbrella handles. Stop telling this nonsense, shall I load more or not? Yes. More, more... come on... What is it? Nine take the Inspector with you to the railway station. You drive well, don't you? No, but quick. Won't this forest ever end? It will end. Today. Why today? I'm wondering myself too. Stop kidding. I'm not kidding. We'll be out of the forest in a minute. Stop for a moment. What is it? I want to take a leak. Our boys take it during the driving. Stop kidding, will you? Damn you... shit... What's the matter? The brakes have broken down. What? It must have happened on a hump. The piping has broken down. The whole hydraulic fluid leaked out. And the hand brakes? A hand brake for twenty tons? I pull it once and it's finished. Well? I go on. I must be in the town before the others anyway. We'd better wait for the others. What? Let's wait for the others. It will take them about 2 hours. Two hours? Why? We work collectively. When one of us takes an illegal ride the rest have defects. And the horn? Does the horn work? What? The horn, does it work? Remove two steps from the truck. What? Nothing, I was holding my hand on the horn the whole time. Did you hear anything? Nothing. We are in the mountains. When the wind blows you won't hear a shot three steps from you. Goodbye Sir. Go straight! Come on... we'll fetch the box. It was to bring him good luck... in ten days nobody will be able to say who is who. I'll take it. Are you superstitious? No, but I don't like my face. You are scared. Just like you. Come on, Orsaczek and stop it damn you. They will go alone with him. I'm fed up with that. Shall we go to the town or something? What for? We don't have any money. Good people will give us credit. Hey Zabawa, how much is my soul worth to you, Judas? I'm not Saviour. It's a believing soul, well preserved in alcohol, how much? I can lend you a thousand, here you are. God won't forget you for it. I would prefer if you didn't forget it, it's a loan. Are you nuts? No, we've come to become nuts. Take the spare tire to the cloakroom. Do you want to go with a wheel to a restaurant? Will you pay if somebody steals it? Waiter! Moment... What is it? Something tall. Sure, boss, it'll be here in a minute. Apostle... Yes, sonny? Will I ever have this taxi? Sonny, you don't understand... What? Why the devil do you want it? I want to live... How? Old asshole, you may hit me. Speak up. What do you want to do? I want to get back to the town. I'll get back to the town. You're dressed like a madam in a whorehouse. Are you going to have a good time? No. I'm going to have a meeting with some whores. Why today? It's as good as any other day. I'll do it in honor of Nine. He told me yesterday about his last whore. I'll go back to the town. But you're in the town. Where? Here! This is not the town. I don't know how to drive now. I must run on the third gear more than half of the way. Yesterday water boiled in the radiator. I can drive two more weeks, that's it. Perhaps those new trucks will finally arrive... Perhaps... I would like a red one... I knew a boy from a fire department once. He had a red car. Why don't you start? I'm lost in my thoughts. How could you win so much then? Haven't you got other troubles? Listen, I'll give you whatever you want, brother... I can carry timber, even stay here forever, whatever you want, but tell me: Was there any evil in the game? Man, are we all crazy? Swear. Swear to what? To God of course. Give him and I'll swear to him. He's here... He must be somewhere close... He gets up early now. The wind too, and the water wakes early, and so do the mountains. Only the Earth... the Earth sleeps very long... You are drunk. I can't stand a third day like this... don't you have any books here? Why do you need a book? Why? I want to read. There isn't a book. So what are you doing here when we are away? I don't know. Aren't you doing anything? Nothing. Are you sitting here all day long? Yes. Sometimes I do some cleaning, I go out and walk a little bit. Than I am waiting again. How are you doing it? Doing what? You and your husband? What are we doing? Don't pretend you don't know. But we are doing nothing... Nothing at all? Nothing. Why? Why? Because one have to love somebody to be close to him. So why are you with him? Who should I be with? Leave him and go back home. But I told you I don't have any home. Oh, yes... Partisan... Yeah? Let's talk. About what? I don't know. Well, how are things between you two? He brought me here, but I want to come back to the town. What will you do in the town? I would have to do something. Sure... the town, that's something different... That's true. The town is different. You must come back to the town. You are so young. I can't stand the thought that the same thing can happen to you that happened to that gangster. To Nine? But why do you care about me? You? No, I don't but run away from here. Tell me something. And you? You've always talked about the forest... the forest... I can tell you something about the forest... that the forest doesn't really change. In winter, fall or summer it's always the same, boring and dangerous, tiring and mean, and always empty. Since when have you been thinking like that? Since the Devil brought me here. If I hadn't come here I would have my memories at least, fighting, a few dead men and the thought that once I wasn't nobody. So leave this place. You are courageous. What future do you have here? And what? Let all those idiots laugh at me? And if you break your neck, silly? So how are things between you two? I told you. It's hard to believe. I wouldn't lie. Maybe I'll forget with you. About the forest? Yes, I came here to remember. Now I'll run off with you to forget. When are we leaving? Whenever you want to. Tomorrow I'll go out to the forest with them, so that they don't suspect anything and I'll take my money. Looks bad... if anybody stops here, we'll never get out again. We will have to unload on the road. At least 3 days work. Perhaps not 3, 3 is too much but 2 for sure. It's impossible to get through now, the trailer will pull down and amen and full stop. Well start unloading, I'll help you. No, I'll drive through. Do you want to be the next one? I thought it is my turn. Next? The next to paradise, to eternal happiness as Apostle says. I will go first. Anybody who wants to follow me better piss before. It's good advice. Hey, Partisan, where are you going? Well? Well, honey would you like a barrel of gasoline? Here is the cigarette. Here you are Apostle. Yes, gentlemen, if Christ had wanted to return, he should have done it today. You know he would have eaten something even God couldn't imagine. Listen Partisan, if you had eaten that barley soup before, you would have flown over that bend as if you had wings. Partisan, you see we should have done it yesterday. We'll go away from here and you'll forget. We'll be far away. All that is ridiculous. I've never been frightened, never, it's your fault. I was thinking of you at the bend. A man must be alone, do you understand? Completely alone if he wants to make something. Only then he has the strength and desire and no fear. Go away now... go away... I couldn't touch you. Maybe because I've fallen in love with you truly. Go away! Do you hear me? Well gentlemen this barley soup is God's and fates reward for all our cursed days. Wanda... Let's run away from here. I can't go on living like that any longer. Without people, without joy, without anybody. I'm alone the whole day long. Come on. But tell me you'll take me away from this place. We must stay for some time. Some time more. How long? Until they call me back. When can it be? I don't know. And they? What about them? Will they stay too? You will never understand it. If they had really wanted to leave, they would have left long time ago. Come on... In the town. When we are in the town. Good morning. Why don't you say anything? What should I say? When will the boys be back? I don't know. Sometimes they don't get back at all. You'd better go to the forest. I'll wait here, I've been riding since early in the morning. We'll have a conversation. What will we talk about? I'll tell you about a cinema or a theatre whatever you wish. Tell me then. A fellow bought a lottery ticket and lost it together with his wallet. Another found it, looked inside and saw the lottery ticket and ah... the fiancée of that guy Which guy? The one who lost it... she was a blonde... she had a nice body... a certain elderly prince was in love with her... so that guy... That's enough. You can't tell anything. I think you didn't understand the movie yourself. Well, now I'll tell you another movie that we'll both understand. Once upon a time there was a fellow who was living in the town, he had a pretty girl, and everything was nice but he had bad luck. He made something that the management didn't like. So they both had to go far to the mountains where nobody was living or coming. Do you understand or shall I repeat the beginning? Well go on, go on. Gangsters, thieves and rogues lived in this damned forest. Because her husband got a job with a company where no respectable person wanted to work. When somebody came out of jail he went to this company, when he was politically suspicious he went to this company. Well? Is it right or not? Have you got a home in the town? And she had nobody to take her away from this place... and so life went on with no joy, no people... Tell me have you got a home in the town? Until one day... I'll finish it for you... until one day a very nice guy appeared and talked very nice things but he knew one thing... because he was a wise guy, that in the mountains it's easy to have a crash that motorcycles can tumble down too and it's very easy to send somebody to Paradise. So this guy listened to the advice of his elder colleague, got on his bike and went to Hell. And what about the girl? I know how it was with Nine. It was the same with Partisan, but more pleasant. I hate to see a hussy making a fool out of a man, sleeping with everybody around. With everybody in the world, but with one never. With a tall, awful one, with a bandit's face never and nowhere. I am the only one who has a home in the town a mother, brothers. I can come back there and take you with me. With you? Buy a mirror and look at your face. Do you hear me? Buy a mirror. The chain broke. In a moment the whole truck will fall over. Maybe not... but the trailer will go to Hell. Pull the pins together with the jack I'll try to pull the ends together. Well... Turn it... More... More... Apostle! Apostle! Apostle! Say something... speak... Don't touch me! Come nearer... give me your gun... Don't say that. I'll pull you out. Take it... it's on my chest. What? The book. Does God see me? He's with you he's always been. Read... page 103. Oh, Jesus, loving Soul I implore you through the dying of your most holy Heart and the pain of your Immaculate Mother, wash with your blood the sinners of the whole world who are dying now. Read... read... I can hear you. Wash with your blood the sinners of the whole world who are now dying and who are to die today. Oh, the Heart of Dying Jesus, have mercy on those dying. Amen. Give them the truth about sleep, life, peace, rest, conscience and freedom. Give them the road without wrong turns or violence, a land where they can do what they think, feel and wish for. Your caps. God be with you. Now and forever. We brought a man. What's wrong with him? He's dead. You're very drunk, aren't you? ...or am I wrong? He was our friend. He believed in God like nobody else. Please listen to us. We are alone, tomorrow we must go further. It's all that we, men can do for him. Carry him into the church. I'll be right there. What was his name? Apostle. Which? This one. There were twelve Apostles. But he was one. That's what we called him. He was very religious, he even said his prayers. And the organist? He went to the town. I can't help it. You can do it. Play"Salve Regina" go on, go upstairs. I can't remember... I remember nothing. Play or I'll kill you. Don't cry, sing. We should dance, we should live harmonium plays quietly... Wake up boys, wake up. Don't bother. You could shoot from a cannon and they wouldn't hear you. They got completely drunk yesterday. Damn them. Could you receive their salaries? Ok. You look pretty today. Count please. Zabawa, is it correct? Orsaczek. Yes Warsawer. Yes Apostle. He's not here. Where is he? He's gone. Where? Where all men go... My goodness, fancy that, they know nothing there and send money up, and I ride and carry it. Don't make a fool out of yourself. Everybody here knows that you take the dead's salaries. They told me that once you took a salary for three months for somebody had been pushing up daisies for a long time. It's a lie. Firstly it wasn't three months only two, secondly nobody ever planted any daisies on his grave. Do you think I should live as you do here? No honey... I told you the movie but this bandit didn't let me finish. But I'll do it now, well and sure. Listen... They all will go to Heaven and your husband with them... or maybe he'll just become a helpless cripple... who knows? And then you? What about me? An old, ugly woman will come back to the town and nobody would marry her she would have to go on a street so drunkards would look at her. Yes... yes... this movie won't have a happy ending. That's a pity. I would like it to end otherwise. Have you got a home in the town? Of course I have, but why should I tell you about it? I'll tell you, I'll go away and you'll get back to this hellhole. What do you need that for? Buzka! Let's go. Where to? Where to? To the town. We'll go but not all of us. It's easy to cheat you. My home... I live in a workers' hotel, my dear. We are forty in one room. Don't be a fool. Be nice to the end. My motorcycle... it's fallen... I think so too. What's now? Quite a lot of things... how was it with her Buzka? Not bad. I'm sorry but it was the last girl in your life my dear. Fancy that, Warsawer. No, I think that you're kidding. Stop it! Stop it! What have you done? Who is more handsome now, him or me? You women are all the same. Run off! Run now! Warsawer! A mirror... take a look at you now. Hey, Zabawa! Do you have a wife? What do you mean? Shell we bet? You! There's no need to get angry. Do you have anything at all? What did you come here with? With a lie that new trucks will come. A gun when the lie didn't work. With a whore who you said is your wife. Tell me what you know. Don't be a fool. There is nothing you can do anyway. What do you want from her? She's left, she's run off and let her go to Hell. You've got the timber, the gun and us. Isn't that enough? Hey, where are you going? Wait, we're coming with you. Wait, my pals are here, I'll ask them. Howdy, how are things? We don't know each other. I'm Dzwonkowiak so we know each other now. Sit down. Leon my friend, listen. I've got a virgin here, an immaculate one. I must invest some money in her. Lend me five thousand. Will you give it back? No, I won't. You're lucky. If you had said yes, you wouldn't have got a zloty. Here is two thousand you've asked for. Mieczyslaw, your country won't forget you for this. I've talked to everybody. She's not here. She's never been here. You should think like that. In a couple of years the new trucks will come, they will console you. I've forgotten to tell you, they're coming tomorrow. This time for sure. For sure we can only get drunk. It's all I can do for you today. And tomorrow? Tomorrow? We'll part. Let's go, I know a better place. They've swindled me. It's Marcinkowski, he 's cheated me. What's happened? He told me... he would find a car for me, and now he's giving me money. Old scoundrel. A hundred thousand for all I've stolen. A hundred thousand? I can buy shit with it, not a car. A hundred thousand! A hundred thousand! I will go. Wait. Can you hear that? The new trucks? Only now are they really coming for Nine, for Partisan, for Apostle, and the red one for Orsaczek. Partisan, Nine, Apostle, Orsaczek, I don't even know their names. What is your name, Warsawer? Tadek, and yours? Stefan, but it doesn't matter now. You're right. Well, goodbye Stefan. Do you really want to stay, Stefan? Do you really want to leave? You, rogue! The end
