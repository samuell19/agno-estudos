Indeed, Pan Turchinovsky, beauty is a gift of the Holy Spirit, a lifeline for weak and despondent mankind. Art exerts such influence on the man, that he immediately feels the very same urge for truth, which guided our Creator. At such moments one discovers truth about oneself, reveals oneself as a personality. Pan Dyak, and what if it turns out that this truth of yours is overwhelmingly frightening, and great sin weighs upon us? In art, truth is hope. Soul cannot but strive for purification and atonement even for the gravest of sins. Almost 2000 years ago it took Golgotha to make people choose the path of truth, but even that didn't bring salvation. It would have been much worse if it hadn't been for Golgotha! Mankind has to return to where started. So the one who created us made a mistake? No, Pan Petro, it was man who made a mistake, not God! For man chose darkness and neglected light. We're all guilty towards him for we do not believe any more. Yes, we all have to make an effort in order to become different from who we were at birth. Lord, can one experience your miracle in darkness and your justice in the land of oblivion? MIRACLE IN THE LAND OF OBLIVION This summer, Pan Clerk, I have replenished my wine cellar! I've had a rich harvest of gooseberries and made a barrel of gooseberry wine. Do you know how it's made? Pan Hetman, you're an expert in making alcohol. And me, well, you know... Pan Hetman, have you heard people talking about some messiah? Nonsense. There's nothing people enjoy better than talking. What is strange is not that a man who passes himself off as a messiah has appeared, but that he has appeared specifically in our land. What's wrong with it? Isn't our land Christian? Indeed it is, but until now messiahs have given it a wide berth. Nonsense. But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into. Think about that. Excuse me, Pan Skyba, can I ask you something? Go ahead. This Rudivka we're heading to, the name sounds familiar. Haven't I already seen it in our criminal cases? Indeed, and more than once. And who are the victims? God knows. Are you joking? I wish I were. Names, surnames, origins - everything's still unknown. What were they looking for in this land? Their death apparently. Funny, it looks as if someone was passing their own judgement here, in Rudivka. There's only one judgement, Pan Clerk. Let's get down to work. Look, they are waiting for us. Good afternoon. Step aside. Now, let us examine the body. Wait, there's something here... Add to the file, Pan Clerk. Anyone knows the name or surname of the deceased? Anyone?.. No one then?.. Someone must know who he is and where he comes from... So I strongly advice not to conceal anything as this young man, it seems to me, is not the first one to be murdered in your land! I'll ask one more time, "Who found the body?" Fedor Krivoruchenko. Who? The sheperd. We'll conduct the inquiry. Go find Fedor Krivoruchenko right away. Fedor... Krivoruchenko... Where can we sit down? Please, come in the school, officers. Who are you? I'm a local dyak. Stefan Savvych. Please, follow me, Pan Investigator. I work at the school. Can I come in? - You must be Krivoruchenko, the sheperd, is that right? I am. Do you know why you've been called here? - I do. So you do know then? - Yes, yes. So tell us what happened. I was driving a herd in the morning... - Where was it? In Goncharny ravine. You must have seen it when you entered the village - all strangers are buried there. Goncharny ravine then? - That's right. Anyway, I thought to myself, "There's something white out there!" So I came closer and I saw a man lying there. Did you recognize him? - No, Pan Investigator, it was a stranger, because here people don't dress like that even on holidays. He had wide trousers... and a shirt... also white. It was a stranger. Did you tell anyone? - Of course I did - I told Gerasim... - Who? Gerasim. People also call him Palamar. Did Gerasim look at the body? - He did. He didn't touch it though. And here's what we saw - the grass where the body was lying wasn't trampled at all, there was no sign that he'd been killed there. Is that true? - The gospel truth, I swear! Sign. Will Palamar confirm what you've just said? - Of course he will... You can go, Fedor. Excuse me, Pans. Those are my orphans. They live here, in the school. If you need anything... I shall be at your service. You are Gerasim Palamar, aren't you? Yes, Pan. Proceed then, tell us. In the morning I was working in the threshing floor, next to the field. The sun was just rising... And I saw Krivoruchenko, the sheperd, driving his herd, then he left his sheep and came running towards me. "There's a dead body," he screamed, hardly breathing from fear. So you came to look at the body? - I did. With the sheperd. What about the grass, was it trampled? - It wasn't, that's the whole thing. Do you know the deceased? - No, Pan. Must be some stranger. Is that all you know? - Yes, Pan. That's all. Alright, sign then. Can you do it for me, Pan Dyak? Pan Dyak! Sign please. All right. I'll do it if you're asking. I can you're a skillful scribe. Where did you study, Pan Dyak? The same place you did, Pan Clerk. We had the common alma mater. You can go, Gerasim. See, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes He will turn the hearts of the parents to their children, and the hearts of the children... It's raining. Raining indeed. So you studied in Kiev, Pan Savvych? - Yes, as you did, your Worship. Which class? Theory of Poetry. Then, Pan Dyak, you must have a book of poetry? I do. But are you interested in it, Pan Petro? Of course I am, I studied Philosophy for the whole year. I'm asking you this, Pan Dyak, because I also happen to have a book with various notes, and we could exchange. The weather is so dull. Shoo! Do you know, Pans, what's good in such weather? Kusaka! With a lot of pepper. Can't speak for others, but this drink definitely cheers me up. And polynovka, your Worship? No, no, no, Pan Dyak, only kusaka. Trust me, I know a thing or two about it. Isn't it so, Pan Clerk? Yes, Pan Sotnik, but to my liking this your kusaka is way too strong. That's exactly what I'm talking about! It's especially suitable for such weather, so that one doesn't fall asleep! As regards the deceased, ask Beskrovna. Who is this Beskrovna? The tavern keeper. Different kinds of people frequent taverns, you know very well. Who else keeps a tavern in Rudivka? No one. Just her. Vyutska Beskrovna. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon to you too. Welcome, Pans. - We haven't come here to play jokes, Beskrovna! Like I don't know. Have a seat, Pans Investigators. - Thank you. Thank you. You want to ask about the deceased, don't you? - Talk. I don't even know what to talk about. - Tell us exactly what happened. Well, he came on Sunday, around noon, ordered some food. That's all. Tell me, did you recognize him? No, I didn't. God knows who he was. Were there a lot of people at the tavern? - The same ones as always. Sheperds. Lukyan Knurenko, Kochurba and another sheperd, I don't know his name, then Khoma Beda, the cowman. That's all, I guess. Did they drink a lot? - I can't remember now. Well... at first, seven quarts for 3 penny a quart, and then Khoma Beda took three more quarts on credit. Did they quarrel? - No, they just talked a bit and left. Together? - No. Khoma Beda and the deceased stayed a bit longer, and then left too. Were they drunk? Of course! Khoma's wife came to bring him home. He was drunk as a lord! - What about the stranger? He drank very little. Just sat there for a while and then left too. Where did he go? - God knows where. How should I know? - All right, calm down. Right then, we'll have to go search for these sheperds. Why search? They are all here. Is it true what peole say, Pans, that someone has appeared in our land... who passes himself off as a God? Some... Some messiah, whatshisname? Who are you supposed to be, bold fellow? - Khoma Belousenko. Also known as Beda. I'm asking because you're the government people. Here we go again. That's complete nonsense. Funny! This whole messiah thing... And who are you? - I'm Lukyan. Lukyan Knurenko. Anyway, as I was saying, this messiah thing is curious. Authorities remain silent but people are talking! People are talking becuase they need something to talk about. But who has ever seen this man? - People have, they are not blind, you know. By the way, Pan Sotnik, he was not the first one to come to Rudivka, there seems to be quite a spate! Publicians and sinners - all of them are strangers! There's nothing but trouble with them! You are your own trouble. Let's call it a day. Leave that nonsense! All of you can go! Todor Rogachevsky. - Do come in. Pan Sotnik, can I ask you something? - Go ahead. Please, have a seat. - Thank you. Pan Sotnik, it's about that man... What if... what if he comes?.. Perhaps, there was any message from His Excellency? There wasn't?! - Nothing. And what if he comes, what should we do? - God forbid! There's no need for me to tell you, Pan Starosta, but the Holy Bible says that the true Messiah will not come again in peace. Not in peace?! - Exactly. And if someone comes, then seize him as a thief and impostor. Enough now, I'm sick of it. Besides, it's time for dinner! - Yes, yes. Would you agree to be my guests then, Pans? With pleasure, thank you. No, thank you... I'll wait for Pan Dyak here. Do as you please. I'll go. I'll be waiting. You are most welcome. ... Pan Clerk, it doesn't take God to sow evil. Devil can do it just as well. And our Lord is coming not for judgement but love, common well-being and illumination. Something's bothering you, Pan Clerk? - Yes, Pan Stefan, this stranger. You're so determined to prove yourself. - It's not about proving oneself. I often sit like this alone in the evenings and strangest thoughts about the world and our being come to mind. Well, we live because we have to live. - Yes, but one's life is precious to everyone. You don't really mean that, Pan Dyak. It only takes a light clapping of wings, and we are nothing but a handful of dust, while the world lingers on. - But you're forgetting about the fairy-tale. Apart from the transient we also have the subliminal in us. - The subliminal? What is it that makes you think of the subliminal in that poor man? No one even knows his name. The subliminal is in our soul. What makes the world frightening is evil. Evil is committed much more readily than good, but the world still exists. That's because of good. Pan Clerk, my body is dying from an unquenchable thirst. Who has an unquenchable thirst here? Pan Dyak, you are here as well? - Why not? Well, you just might have taken my threat seriously and decided to repay your debt. You must really enjoy taunting me, Vyutska. I'm here for another reason, you ought to know that yourself... I've been invited as a guest, and it's not me who should pay, but dear Pan Petro, the clerk. I'll forgive you this one time, Pan Dyak, but only out of respect to the young Pan. Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. - God bless you, Pan Petro. God bless you, dear Vyutska. - God bless. How old are you, Pan Dyak? - Oh, age.. My age hardly deserves talking about. Man's age is like that of a tree: it is determined by lines of myseries on one's soul. Pan Dyak considers himself young. I've always thought you liked me, dear Vyutska. Of course I do, Pan Dyak. Pan Petro, what about you?.. Do you want to ask me about the deceased? It's Pan Sotnik who asks about the deceased. My job is to write. Just like Pan Dyak, who writes poems and offers them to me. As well as dolls... Pan Dyak, sing for us. You're... I'm a bit... It's always the same thing. People come, move me to tears, and then I take pity on them and forgive their debts... And you, Pan Clerk, will you pay or open credit? I never buy on credit. I'm not showing you the door at all. I've seen so many of your kind without a single penny... Pan Dyak is already sleeping. Now me and you will tiptoe out of here... and escape... Pan Turchinovsky, are you afraid? Are you always so cheerful, Vyutska? - And why not, Pan Clerk? I envy you.. - So cheer up and you'll be cheerful too. As simple as that, Vyutska? - What is there to complicate? If you want to have fun - have fun! If you want to make love - make love! Do not call sorrow upon yourself! Pan Turchinovsky, let's fly!.. Pan Petro, why aren't you coming?.. Was it good? Incredible. My dear Vyutska... How about I take you with me? You'll be my wife. And we'll never separate. This is passion talking in you. And when it fades away, what then? You said yourself, "If you want to make love - make love." So do make love, I have nothing against it. But I'm no match for you, you know that only too well yourself. - No match? Why are you saying that? Because both grass and trees know where to grow. Oh, Vyutska... Dove-eye! What is it? - It's my only friend, guard and foreteller. And what does he foretell? Weather. Good and bad. He also helps me to tell friends from enemies. And you believe in such nonsense, Vyutska? - Do not mock my belief, Pan. Did you sleep badly, Pan Dyak? It's all because of that damned Vyutska. She's not the kind of woman who will let you sleep well. Did you dream of something, or is it that your debt is too big? Oh, debt... My debt is eternal. Oh my God... You are plotting against me, aren't you? Talking like scholars in order to make me look like some kind of fool. What's gotten into you, Pan Skyba? - Pan Turchinovsky, even scholars sometimes play like children. Starosta had good mint spotykach. Where did you sleep last night, Pan Turchinovsky? At Vyutska Beskrovna's, together with Pan Stefan. I'm asking you because we waited for you with the starosta until late in the night. We were enjoying poetry. And you, do you take interest in poetry? - Me?! How could you even think of a silly thing like that? But I tell you, He has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. Oh, God... Why do you keep such a vile creature at home, Pan Dyak? Don't say that, Pan Sotnik. If some of the locals were to overhear us... God forbid!.. In Rudivka it is considered as great luck if a snake lives in one's house. Because he is a guard and a protector. Perhaps he also predicts weather, Pan Dyak? Certainly. And weather as well. Hopeless... What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest... So, Pan Petro, what have we learned here? There are no obvious signs that the man was murdered. Besides, everyone who saw the stranger has an alibi. This case is hopeless. Why should I judge strangers if you don't judge those among you? God judges strangers, so expel the Evil One among yourselves. Should we go home then, Pan Ivan? Yes, Petro. Close the case. Let's get away from this Rudivka. Pan Dyak, the case is closed. Away from this Rudivka, otherwise we'll soon lose our own minds. Your wife will not be able to recognize you. She'll say, "Go away! I'm waiting for my husband, and won't let a stranger in the house without him!" Will you accompany us to the outskirts, dear Pan Dyak? The more the merrier. Indeed, Pan Stefan, would you be so kind? Hop on the clerk's horse and let's go. Come on. See, he's a god cossack. Now go home everyone. Farewell. - Farewell. Good bye, Pan Sotnik, farewell and God bless you. Unfortunately, our investigation resulted into nothing. I don't know about you, Pan Clerk, but I'm sick to the back teeth of this case. I've had enough. You know what, Pan Dyak, I can't help feeling that everyone here knows how it happened. It seems like that stranger didn't manage to run far. He had nowhere to run. Home sweet home. - Looking forward to returning, Pan Petro? Everyone needs a roof above their head in order to live in this world, otherwise they are bound to end up like that stranger. It's loneliness. It comes suddenly, like death. No, Pan Petro, death doesn't come suddenly. It enters our body with our first scream, right at the moment of our birth, and then lives inside of us until it gets the better of us. Unfortunately, investigation hasn't been able to solve the mystery of Rudivka, as the identity of the deceased hasn't been established. But it's a man, not a needle. He can't just get lost in a haystack. I realized that he can't disappear without a trace like a blade of grass or a flower. This mystery perturbed my soul, filling it with sorrow. I couldn't help feeling guilty towards the deceased. Perhaps, this story would have been forgotten with the lapse of time, which cannot be reversed, if this very man, that had been buried in Goncharny ravine, hadn't turned up in Rudivka again. Pan Turchinovsky! Pan Turchinovsky! Pan! Pan Turchinovsky! You are called to Rudivka again. Something's happened there! I'm coming! Get the horse! Who knows the name or surname of the deceased? No one?! I'm asking you, "Who is he?" Surely, you're not going to say you see him for the first time? All right, let's call everyone. So you don't recognize him? I've never seen him before. A stranger. Never seen him. - Alright then, enjoy yourselves... - Not from around here. Have fun. This man was once dead and then returned to life. Once was lost but then was found. - A stranger. - Never seen him, swear to God. Isn't it a miracle? - I don't know him. Never seen him. So you don't know... Don't recognize... Is that all of them? I said, "Is that all?" - All. Alright then, go home. Pan Clerk, come here. Yes, Pan Skyba? - Please, take down witnesses' testimonies and then you may leave. What about you? - There's some urgent business in Glukhiv. I'm going there. But what about the investigation? - Investigation is closed. Pan Petro, remember last directions of His Highness. Farewell, Pan Rogachevsky. Farewell, Pan... Clerk... Petro, don't take this case personally. Pan Rogachevsky! - Yes? I don't think I have seen Pan Dyak here. He is sick. - What's wrong with him? How should I know? Perhaps, it's... Pan Stefan. Oh, it's you, Pan Clerk?! - Yes, Stefan, it's me! God has sent you to me once again. I'm glad to see you. What's wrong with you, Stefan? You seem to have grown old... What sickness torments you? Thirst. Unquenchable thirst. Pan Dyak, have you heard what happened in the village? Yes, Pan Petro. It's a sad story. A sad and a mysterious one. Believe it or not, but I feel like in biblical times, when it was easier to meet God than an ordinary decent man in the street. Tell me, have you seen him? Who are you talking about? - You know, that dead man in the ravine. Oh... yes. So? - Well, obviously, I recognized him. You did? Why didn't you come to give the testimony? Why didn't you let the truth be known? For the same reason as Your Worship. What for? The world doesn't sympathize with anything profound anyway. And besides, what makes you think I know the truth? The only thing I'm sure in is that he was doomed as soon as he appeared in the village again. Everyone recognized him... Yes. Recognized and hated. Everything in the world repeats itself. The same stories recur over centuries. People have lost truth again. I witnessed everybody renounciating today. Some aloud, some under their breath. Let's go inside, it's getting dark. Tell me honestly, Pan Dyak, is the deceased a messiah? - No, Pan Petro, unfortunately, he's not a messiah. Although we should probably rejoice, as this man was once dead and then returned to life, was once lost and then was found. Isn't it a miracle? Several days ago we received an order from His Highness. What about? To seize him wherever he may hide, put him in shackles and send him to the main office as a criminal and trouble-maker. What's wrong with you, Pan Dyak? You've gone pale. It's true, it has always been like this - as soon as he appears, also appears someone who tries to kill him. The one who will betray him will bring death upon him. Pan Dyak! What's wrong with you? Are you sick? Thank you. I'm a miserable man. Pan Petro, in front of you is the one who for a long time has been hoping to meet someone to understand his thoughts, to give a hand and be faithful. I loved the world although I wasn't able to find order in it, because I wanted to live out of wisdom which was too profound. I believed in dreams and visions which I often had. Some were amused by my revelations, some were disturbed or frightened. In all my life I've never had a person to offer a hand and sincerely sympathize. I craved peace I didn't have. I extolled restlessness of spirit, while at the same time leading a wretched life. I wanted to love and didn't have anyone. I wanted to return God to these blind sleepwalkers, and what I got in the end was murder of an ordinary poor man. Pan Dyak, so it was you who spread the rumour about a messiah among people?! Yes, Pan Petro. Indeed, your fairy-tale has a frightening end. How wonderful was the image that I had created! And now the prodigal son has returned to his father. Terrible... I'm to blame for the death of this man... My God... Do not exaggerate your guilt. Pan Petro... I don't know who the deceased is, but the man who appeared at Rudivka is the spitting image of his predecessor. Yes, I'm also sure there were two of them, but what evidence there is? Here is the evidence. Do you recognize this, Pan Dyak? - Yes, I do. The deceased had been wearing this same medallion. How about this one? At least we have something. Who knows, maybe they were two brothers separated by fate? Or, incredibly alike... Twins! Who am I? Where do I come from? What was I born for? Where is my home? My family... Parents... Who am I? Why this shame? Hey you! Foundling from the river! Why don't you bow? Can't you see? What do you want? I want you, foundling, not to forget to bow before your superior. What? What did you call me? Foundling. I said, "Foundling from the river!" I said, "Foundling from the river!" - What? Foundling! What?! - I said, "Foundling!" Don't you and your people dare to call me a foundling! Anyone home? - What is it? What a fellow! - Master! Don't you look at fellows, woman! Can't you see, he's looking for work? Decide by yourself then. Have a seat. Let's talk. Where are you from? - I'm coming from the valley. Where do you belong? - Nowhere. Are you from the Holy Spirit then? Like Adam or Christ? Who are your parents? Where is your family? Your home? If only I knew my parents. I'm an orphan. - They are the best workers! Can you tend cattle? Try me, and you'll see what I'm worth. Deal. My name is Simon. Simon Levayda. Where are you, woman? Feed the worker. What's your name, young man? Znayda. Alright, Znayda, let's see what kind of eater you are. Have a seat. You know what they say, one eats as much as one works. Znayda, huh! Eat. You won't get hot borsch in the steppe. You're so gloomy, you must have come a long way? Do you want some more? Here, eat. Hungry? I always eat like this. Lida! - What? I was saying that it's been a month since we hired a new sheperd. Ivan says he's good. Really? - Clever fellow. He quickly learned the ropes. Alright then. Simon, why don't I buy a new kerchief? And beads, what do you say? - Of course, Lida. Buy the best ones. Anyway, Ivan praises him but also grumbles a bit. - What about? Says he seems to be somewhat strange. Just sits there silently, one can't get a word out of him. He won't even drink vodka to keep company. And besides he works as if under the lash. Under the lash or not, he's still doing the work. That's what Ivan says too. Maybe it's a bad thing that he doesn't drink vodka? It's both a bad thing and a good thing. After all, unlike wolf, man lives among other people. He should make friends. I'm worried about it. If you ask me, he's a good guy. What do you want from an orphan? He grew up alone, among strangers all his life. He has never experienced kindness or tasted good food. You know how to make one change their mind, Lida. Buy yourself a skirt too! You know what I've just thought? I should try him How? - I'll give Ivan two days off. Znayda will be alone with the herd. I'll sneak up and see how he watches his master's property. If he's vigilant enough, he'll stay, if not, I'll steal a cow from him. What do you think? - What can I say? Do as you please. I feel sleepy, I'd better go to bed. - Go if you want, I'll stay up a bit longer. And that servant who knew his master's will, but did not get ready or act according to his will, will receive a severe beating... Mistress... Mistress... Znayda killed your husband! Znayda! Znayda! Znayda! It's you... Forgive me that I testified against you... Somehow it just happened, you know how it goes... I still can see the master covered in blood... I interceded with you in the court though... And the mistress said it wasn't your fault but Simon's... Not mine... Of course. And officials are of the same opinion. Otherwise you'd be hanging from a tree by now. You don't bear a grudge now? You don't resent me? Why should I resent you, Ivan? It's myself I should resent. - Why are you running away then? What else can I do? Come back to the mistress whose husband I killed? It is her who has sent me to look for you. She has? - Of course. She said, "He has nowhere to go, poor orphan. Let him serve as before." It's true that I have nowhere to go. Then come back. You hear me? Let's go! Here, have a drink. - No. Drink it! - No. It's devil's slop. It's a drink of God! You must have grown up in the monastery, how come you haven't tasted vodka before? I just haven't. Have a drink! Just drink it and everything around you will start singing at once! - It's vodka that does the singing. No, it's not. Just sip a bit and grass will become the music! Here, drink! Alright, let it play! Wait, Ivan! Hang on! - Keep up! God is my witness, Znayda, I have a feeling that you're not an ordinary man! Perhaps, you were even born in a white shirt. You're not like others. There's no fear in you... Oh, wait, Ivan, it seems like it's starting to sing! What is that? They are carrying a dead child to set it afloat. That's how I was found, in exactly the same dugout... Hang on, but these dugouts are only made for dead children. I was alive. Alive... Wait, Ivan... The grass... is starting to sing... Forget about the grass, I'll tell you a secret. Oh, Ivan!.. Let me take one more sip. People are talking, saying some man appeared among us, almost God. Who? Some say Lord, some say Messiah Maybe they are just lying? - Maybe, but not all of them. Some wandering monk told me that from time immemorial, as soon as he appears, also appears the one who tries to kill this man. The one who will betray him? - Yes. We should find him and warn him about it. I'd go looking for him, but I can't do it alone. Will you come along? You know what I really want? What? Peace, Ivan. Peace... You've matured, boy. Why haven't you turned up so long? Because I'm at fault. It's not you who is at fault but my late husband. You watched our property conscientiously. Do you like it being in the steppe? I thought... why don't I take you to help me take care of the household? It's hard for me to cope without a man. As you wish. Look, Znayda, even dogs don't bark at you, they recognize you as one of us! Dogs don't bark because they are afraid of me. That's nonsense! Go wash yourself. You've grown thin. Go now. Put this on. - No, it's your husband's shirt. So what shall I do with it now? I had a strange dream - I was little and you were big. There's nothing strange about that - I'm older than you are... That's why you dreamt of it. Look, it's so white! Go to the steppe, and help Ivan. Come back in the evening. I'll be waiting. What is it? - The most precious thing I've got. The man who brought me up had found this on me. Shall we have a look? Not now. Have a look while I'm away. No. Simon!.. You hear me, Simon? You're a devil and a murderer! Here is the retribution!.. God, strike me and annihilate me, and scatter me so that there's no trace left of me! What happened?.. What happened? What happened?! Great misfortune... Has someone attacked you? It's us... we attacked ourselves... Medallion... Medallion? Our misfortune is in it. What? It's me... It was me who gave you this medallion at birth. I'm... your... mother... And my father?! Simon who you killed. Hang on, there's something wrong... You are too young to be my mother!.. No... I wasn't even sixteen when I started serving here... And then?! And then I gave birth to two boys. Twins... But Simon didn't recognize them as his children. I have a brother? Mum, do I have a brother?! Yes, son... Mum... Mum, talk... Mum, talk to me! Mum?.. Znayda! Is it you, Ivan? It's been three days that I'm following your trail. I'm coming from the hamlet... It is burnt down and the mistress is dead! What's wrong with you? Ivan, grief is gnawing at me. Listen, where is that man everyone's looking for? Who are you talking about? - The saint. What do you need him for? - Let's go together. No. No! Ivan, don't leave me! Ivan! Why?! - Death is following you! Ivan! No! Ivan! Incredible. Those who killed this poor man thought they killed God, forgetting that the Son of Man will come not to destroy, but to save the souls of the lost. Age of enlightenment! But all these strangers from Goncharny ravine, it's them who are the bearers of the people's passions. They wander bearing pain and suffering of the people, its legends and fairy-tales, and prophecy of the things to come. Otherwise there would be nothing of value in the people's memory. The people would be condemned to being nothing more than dust. For it is exactly those people who are gifted with a spiritual instinct. Their inner voice speaks of greatness of the nation and the people's spirit. Who knows, perhaps there's the true Messiah among them? For a prophet is a creation of the people. What have you brought, Timofiy? Some bread, Pan Dyak. And a new song. He is my best singer. His singing can move a stone to tears. It's all we can offer you, Pan Clerk. Leave it to your orphans. Timofiy, is there a place one one buy some good food? At the store. Go buy something. - I'll be back in a flash! Timofiy is my true treasure. If there's someone I wasn't expecting to see it's you, Pan Clerk. Good evening. Nice to see you, Pani Vyutska. - Have a seat. So, Pan Clerk, are you here for amusement or on business? His Worship has payed me a visit. Make yourselves comfortable. - Thank you. Pan Dyak, you must be enjoying eating for free. I am, Vyutska. Just eating is one thing, but eating and looking into your eyes is much better. You're still lustful despite being old. You've arrived so unexpectedly, Pan Clerk. All the guys are surprised by your arrival as well. Surprised that you've found a friend in the dyak. You are rich, and the dyak is almost a beggar. You hear this, Pan Dyak, the woman doesn't know what spiritual kinship is. Her way of thinking is like that of the crowd, conventional. In this uncivilized age only the tangible is valued. Sing to us, Pan Dyak, it's no good dancing without singing. I dreamt of you last night, Pan Turchinovsky. Tell me about it, Vyutska. It was frightening. Don't you want to dance with us? They are going crazy, drunks... Let's leave, Pan Petro. Who says I don't? - Now you're talking! Listen carefully, Pan. You don't belong here. I advice you to leave Rudivka. What if I don't? The one who walks in the dark can stumble. Why are you so scared, Khoma? Maybe you have something to confess to? Are you trying to judge me? The God will judge you, Khoma. The investigation is over. There's no evidence against you. So you're trying to play nice. What's wrong with me being nice? Your niceness is power. You are the powers that be, and we are just ordinary people. Perhaps power needs niceness more than you who are showing off their ordinariness? Go while the going is good! Vyutska, can I come to your place? - Leave me alone, Khoma. So you disdain the locals, hm? You witch. Go away, you're drunk. - It if were my decision, all strangers would... - Where do you see any strangers, Khoma?! Everyone who is here belongs here. My tavern is open for everyone. Pan Turchinovsky, be my guest! Don't go... I told you not to go! Farewell, Pan Dyak. You know... I suddenly understood how it all had happened. What was on these mad people's minds suddenly releaved itself. I'm convinced, this is exactly how his death had begun. Who are you, woman? Maybe it's true that you are a witch. If only I were... Aren't those inside enough for you? - No! Take me with you. - No way. Aren't I good enough for you? Everyone I love dies... - That's fine with me! Take me, I have never been with a man before. So good! Come... Sleep, Znayda, sleep. Are you tired? - Yes. Rest. Grief has wearied you. It has been exhausting you all your life. It was born with you, rejoicing at being born in the foreign world. Now you're mine... You wanted peace? Yes. Yes. Then I'll give you peace. Sleep. Sleep, Znayda... Here is what happiness is like... - I love you. Here he is! Get ready to receive your just deserts. Isn't he the one everyone's looking to kill? What do you hate me for, people?! It's not us, it's your fault... Why have you come here? What do you want from us? You've come to destroy us. I know who you are! If you are the Lord, then save youself! Dear God, your grace is infinite! Don't hide Your face from me. But reveal Your grace to me, I put my trust in You. Make me alive again... Enough. This sucker's had enough. Alive! Alive! Where am I? I'd like to ask you the same. How did you get there? Can't remember, for the life of me. You frightened us to death! Yes. If it wasn't for Pani Vyutska... Don't cry, dear Vyutska. Everyone's safe and sound, Thank God... Not everyone... Pan Dyak, where will we go now? We'll look for a new home, Timofiy. Because only we, wandering monks, have a wonderful opportunity to travel freely. Look! - What is it? What about the others? All the others are bound, each in one's own way, to one's work, home, wife and children, books or a wine cellar. Everything in the world should be where it belongs.
