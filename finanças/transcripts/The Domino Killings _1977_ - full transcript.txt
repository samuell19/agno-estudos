Do you believe you decided to come to this theatre today? That it was your own idea, of your own freewill. Whether we note or not, we are all manipulated. It's becoming almost impossible to think or even act for ourselves anymore. We're manipulated, programmed, brainwashed right from the start, right from the day we're born. By family, by press, by radio, by television. And more and more we know less and less of who they are. Who could they be? Is it the boss we work for? Who tells him what to do? Is it the government? Whoever is in power it seems just the same. So, who is behind them? It's reached the point when they could take an ordinary man and so manipulate him that they could get him to kill the most important person in the world. Like the heroe of a book written by Franz Kafka fifty years ago. We feel ourselves powerless unable to control any more what really happens to us. Perhaps we're all a victim of some appalling conspiracy. Whay authority could they represent? Listen to me. I want you to watch what happened to this ordinary man. He lived in a country with a legal Constitution. All the laws were enforced. Like many of his generation, he was sent to fight in Vietnam. He survived, fell in love, got into trouble wound up in jail. Then, they really started to work on him. He fell victim to what they call "the domino principle".

What kind of things? Nothing definite. Your name keeps floating around. We need some shelves built. It'll be several days work. Now, when we send down for you, make sure you check out your tools before you come up. Yes, sir. - Warden Ditcher's waiting for you. - Yes, sir. All right. There's a man here that wants to talk to you. A man from the outside. Now he may need to talk to you more than once. Yes, sir. You're not to blow this to anybody. You open your mouth, and it'll be your ass. You understand? Yes, sir. All right. Mr. Tagge. This is Roy Tucker. Please to meet you, Mr. Tucker. I'm Marvin Tagge. Thank you, Warden. Pull up a chair. No pressure to this meeting. I promise you. I just thought we ought to have a little talk. I... I represent a group of people who might be able to help you. District Attorney's Office? Parole board? No, no, no. No, I have nothing to do with that end of it. But there are lots of ways to skin a cat. Now let me get this straight now. You want to help me and you want nothing in return. We will definitely want something in return. Like what? I'm in here for at least fifteen more years. I could wash out you underwear. Make you some shelves, a dandy lilttle breadboard. That's about it. You're going too fast, Mr. Tucker. We're not sure you're the man for us. That's why I'm here to talk with you. When we know, you'll know. What about Ditcher? Where does he fit in? He doesn't. You mean you tell him what you want and he'll do it? I think so. Get me out of maximum security. All right. My cellmate's Spiventa. Get him out, too. All right. I don't know who you are, Mister, but I think you're handing me a first-class line of bullshit. How'd you manage this? I didn't manage anything. No, the Warden just thought we were a couple of okay guys. Is that it? I told you what Bowkamp said. We had a good record so we rated better. Don't give me that. It don't play that way! They don't play that way. - It was Ditcher, wasn't it? - I told you about that. I was just doing my job. The job, sure. Nailing up shelves. I'm the Virgin Mary. Don't, don't get me wrong. Whatever you're doing, just keep on doing it. Before you know it they'll be sending us tap beer, a couple of eighteen year old pussies. We can play hide the wienie every night. There's no two ways about it. He's the meanest and the baddest. Soft-spoken though. To look at him you wouldn't think he'd swat a fly. Yeah. But inside meaner than cat shit. Smart, too, they tell me. Good buddies with the man upstairs. Yeah! Pushin' his tool in the Warden's office. Up there screwin' his way into an early parole. Close your ears. Pretend he's not here. You know I don't want to close my ears, I'm gonna close his mouth! Did I ever tell you about my old man's delicatessen? You never stopped telling me about your old man's delicatessen. I can smell it now. That's your socks. Twenty kinds of salami. Thirty, thirty kinds of cheese. Peppers, peppers hangin' on a string. Pickles in the barrel. Did I ever tell you about my wife? Married fifteen years. Her idea of birth control was to cross her legs, get the hiccups, and call her mother on the phone. And fuck you, Charlie McCarthy! I don't understand it. You're crazy about your wife. You never talk about her. I can't stand mine. I can't stop talking about her. Can you explain that to me? Tell me about the delicatessen again. Did you enlist or were you drafted? A little bit of both. A judge in Wheeling gave me a choice of either, going to jail or going into the Army. If I had it to do over again, I'd take jail. Well, it doesn't sound that way from your record. Top marksman, Purple Heart, Sergeant's stripes. Pretty good. Yeah, I can play the game. I'm pretty good at it. Play by anybody's rules if I have to. It says here you received a severe wound. - Was shot in the ass! - No. Yeah. If you call that severe. Multiple lacerations of the "gluteus maximus". I'd call that severe. And when you left the hospital you were eligible for a discharge. But you refused it. Well, that's what it says in the papers, but that's not the way it was. No, they sent me to a hospital in Hawaii, and there was, this doctor there, Major Applegate. And he had a lot of missionary blood in him. He was gonna make a man out of me. You know, take a jailbird, turn him into a solid citizen. That was his idea. Even had me believing it for a minute or so. What happened? You know what happened. It's all there in the folder. Let me ask you about this man you killed. I didn't say I killed him. The court did. - The man's name was Riggins? - Yeah. Bert Riggins. And your wife was convicted, too? Yeah, they said she was an accessory. It says here when you met your wife, she was married to Riggins. That's right. She's been out of prison for over a year now. Where is she living? How in the hell do I know where she's living? Doesn't she write to you? She used to. After a while I told the mail guy to send her letters back. What's the point in hanging her up? What about Dr. Applegate? He was a great reader. He kept pushing books at me. He said everything I needed to know was right there in the books, if I'd just take the time to find it. I tried. I just couldn't cut it. I'm no reader. Can't be alone like that. Get crazy if there isn't somebody around the house. Some people, some dogs and cats. Alone to me means punishment. Always has. Paula! There was a sadassed excuse for a woman. She'd been so brainwashed by the nuns she couldn't take a piss without going to confession. Every time I'd put my tongue in her mouth, I couldn't gey it out before she'd say forty Hail Marys. Instead of, instead of getting her period every twenty-eight days, she had periods that lasted twenty-eight days. Come on. Finally, I took a look at her. I said: "My God!" There she was with the screwdrivers in her hair, wires on her, it looks like an electric woman. I said: "Pass!" From then on I went out and I humped everything I could get on a chair to do it to. Listen, swordsman, can we go back to the delicatessen and talk about the cheeses, salamis, the peppers... Anything except pussy? Right. I'll be with you in a minute. Fuck you, rosebud. Bowkamp! - I gotta get some fresh air, okay? - It's okay. It's okay. What's the matter with you? Why nothing. What's the matter with you? You want me to get Ditcher in here? Yeah, get him in here. We'll tell some dirty jokes. Get drunk. Don't look at me like that! Don't look at me like I'm some kind of a bug. You or anybody else! And don't forget it! I don't even know what I said to set you off. I'm sorry if I seemed preoccupied but we're all under enormous pressure, Tucker. I'm Ross Pine. Marvin Tagge's out of town. He asked me to come and talk to you. It's important. You want to take a seat? Just a couple of more things we need to know. In Vietman, what kind of an outfit were you with? Search and destroy. And what does that mean exactly? Well, that means exactly what it sounds like. What it means. We went out looking for gooks and we tried to kill them before they tried to kill us. I never got to see any action, but I always wondered what it was like to kill another human being. Are you asking me what it's like? - Yes, if you know. - Yeah, I know. Well, see, It's like... Swatting a fly. No, no, no, no. It's more like getting laid. Yeah. That's what it's like. After the fist time it comes easy. I know this is personal. What about your wife, Eleanor? What about her? It's because of her you're in here, isn't that right? What makes you think that? We have the trial transcripts. Well, we know all about Riggins. How'd she happen to marry a man like that? He fooled her. What do you mean he fooled her? He was a drunk. They hadn't been married more than a month and he started coming home half gassed, punching her around. I couldn't stand the idea of her living with a guy like that. Being in the same house. Sleeping in the same bed. And she couldn't stand it either. She wanted to be with me. You know when you're miserable you need somebody to talk to. So the two of you... Not the two of us. Just me. Tucker. Tagge says you're innocent. He says Riggins killed himself. - It's too bad Tagge wasn't on the jury. - Well, isn't that what you told him? Not exactly. What I said was that was my lawyer's story. But nobody believed it. I killed Riggins. I killed him all right. You can write that down. And if he came back here today, alive, I'd kill him again. Put that down, too. Write the name Harry Waldron on that card. W- A-L-D-R-O-N. You better write it a couple of times. And who's Harry Waldron? That's you. It's the name you'll have on your passport. Smile. Attaboy. Nice! Again! Your passport. You have your own business. Waldron Exports. Hospital equipment. Nobody's gonna quiz you about it, so don't worry. And here's the deed to your house. It's in Spanish but you can see your name there as the owner. What's that? Address is all covered up. How do I know where it is? You don't. Not yet. Your bankbook. The rate of exchange is eight and a half to one. That means there's two hundred thousand dollars in your name. How do I know that's not a banana? Because we say so. We're pulling you outta here tomorrow. That should tell you something. It's not good enough. I want Ditcher's guarantee. Ditcher's not in this. He's in it. He's in it all right. He has to be. Goddamn it! I was told, you told me that this could be done without me! Now we're telling you something else. I understand, I'm walking out of here tomorrow. You want to tell me how? Tell him. Northwest corner of the yard. Eight-thirty in the morning. The guard will let you out. What's his name? Beckman. You'll get in a bakery truck. Who's driving it? Our man. Jesse Tunstall. - No inspection at the gate? - No. No. Does that satisfy you? Not quite. I'm taking Spiventa with me. Jesus Christ! It's out of the question. Maybe if we'd planned for it sooner. Well, that's it. If Spiventa doesn't go, I don't go. Bowkamp! The Warden called down. He says to bring the prisoner upstairs again. If they want to kill somebody, they can get a hitman outside. But they want you. - You know why? - I don't know and I don't care. They take you outta here, and they own you. You're a pair of hands they own. Nobody's gonna miss a number if they get rid of you. Who's they? You keep talking about they. Who do you think they are? I don't know who in the hell they are. Well, you better know. Guarantee you one thing. They ain't black or Puerto Rican or Navajo Indian. They're never anything you can identify. They're just they. They eat lunch together. On the phone a lot. Most of all, they manage things like, money and people. They're looking for a lost dog with no name. No future, nothing. Where do you go look for that? In a prison. They always get some poor bastards like you and me to do the dirty work. Oscar, you're paranoid. - What? - You're sick. They don't even want you. They said if you came, they're gonna drop you between here and Mill Valley. - Yeah. They're not gonna drop me any place. You know why? I ain't going. You're Beckman, I'm Tucker. Open it up. I changed my mind, I'm going with you. I've changed my mind. You're not going. Screw you, commodore. I'm going. If you've got nothing to lose, neither have I. Okay, let's go. Roll out, boys, you're changing cars. Right over here, please. One at a time. Tucker first. - You're Tucker. Right? - Right. Back seat, please. You bastard, you! We didn't kill Spiventa. You did. He was dead before he left prison. Remember that. I don't think you've met our colleague, Tom Reser. Hello. I'm sorry about the bump on the head. It's Tuesday afternoon. You're in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in San Francisco. You'll be here for three days. This lady is Helen Gaddis. Now, look, excuse me, general. You're out of prison now. That was our part of the bargain. Now, it's your turn. For the next few weeks, you're working for us. We own you. You're bought and paid for. Now, It's extremely important you understand what I'm telling you. He understands, Ross! We've got a surprise for you. It'll be just a minute. All right. Your clothes are hanging in the closet. There's a passport, credit cards and money. You're free to come and go as you wish. Nobody's standing guard over you. San Francisco is step number one. When it's time for step number two, Gaddis here will let you know. We know your friend Dr. Applegate lives here. And Schnaible your lawyer. It'd be better if you didn't get in touch with them. Be better for you and a lot better for them. What about the police? - What about them? - They'll be looking for me. - No, they won't - You guarantee that? You walked out of jail. They're on the line. Someone wants to talk to you. Hello. Roy? Ellie. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you fine. It's just that... It's been a long time. Where are you? I'm in San Francisco. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. Listen. Everything's gonna be all right, honey. I promise you that. Roy. Oh, Jesus God, Ellie, don't cry, please! Where are you kid? They don't want me to say. Well. Hello. - Where is she? - Out of the country. Goddamn it, stop playing games with me. It's no game, Tucker. You get nothing from me until I see my wife. You understand? We're way ahead of you. Three days from now you will be with your wife. You'll be in your own house, and you'll get the money. I'll believe that when I see it. That's fair enough. If you need to contact us for any reason just call the Bell Captain. Tell him your air conditioner's not working. One of our people will get back to you. Ross. Operator. This is Harry Waldron. Room 1705. I just made a long distance phone call and I misplaced the number. Would you check your book please, and tell me what that was? Sorry sir, but no record of that call. What do you mean? I just made the phone call. No toll charges at all against your room, sir. Hello? What the hell? I'll bet you a drink if I was to buy you one, you'd say no. You'd lose. - I'll have a gin and tonic. - I'll have a beer. Lester, a gin and tonic and a bottle of Bud. Now an up-date on that San Quentin prison break. Police officials say that one of the convicts, Oscar Spiventa was shot to death by his cellmate, Roy Tucker. You don't thind I'm a hooker, do you? - No. - I'm not. I work for a big paper company. Jesse Tunstall the truck driver who was kidnapped by Tucker was found half-conscious tonight in a field near Canadian Falls, Montana. Executive secretary. We make napkins and john paper and... Excuse me. Sports news tonight. Cal Tilman for the Los Angeles... Hello, is Ronald Schnaible there, please. - It's Roy Tucker calling. - Who is it? He says his name is, Tucker, Roy Tucker. I'm not here. I'm sorry but Mr. Schnaible's not here. I'm out of town. He's out of the city. Put Schnaible on the phone. Tell him if he's not on the phone, I'm gonna catch a cab and be over in twenty minutes. Why did you ask where I called from? I don't know. Just a casual question, I guess. No, it wasn't. You know it and I know it. Look, Roy, don't try to muscle me. I'm telling you the truth. Okay. Easy enough to find out. I'll just tell them I talked to you and see what they say. Come on, Roy, give me a break. All right. - They did contact me. - Who? - I don't know and I don't wanna know. - That's not good enough. Look, Roy. All I can tell you is this: If they kill you and me on this car, right now, there's not gonna be any arrest. There's not gonna be anything about it in the newspapers. Roy. I'm an attorney. I see this kind of crap all the time. I mean... that's just the way things work. You do what they tell you. Keep your mouth shut. Maybe, just maybe you might get out of this with your skin. Otherwise put a bullet through your brain. That's your other choice. It's Mr. Waldron in 1705. You have a message for me? Yes, sir. It says: "Watch the ten o'clock news. Channel Six. " We have learned that he was found dead in his car in the garage of a Lombard Street office building. Mr. Schnaible was born in Oak Park, lllinois, but was a prominent criminal lawyer here in the Bay Area for the past seventeen years. He was also active in state politics. He was a state Assemblyman from the Twenty-third District and was being mentioned as next in line for the Attorney-Generalship of the state of California. On the national scene in Washington today both the House and the Senate agreed... This is Waldron, Room 1705. I'm having some problems with my air conditioner. Thank you. Yeah. Did you call about your air conditioner? Mr. Waldron, my name's Henemyer. Welcome, Mr. Tucker. Your wife's out at the house. Come on. I've got a car. - What have you told her? - About what? - About the whole situation. - Not much. I thought you could handle that better than we can. Does she know how I got out of jail? No. She thinks we're an organization that tries to help innocent men. That we find fresh evidence and try to arrange for a new trial. - Did you tell her that? - No. But Pine gave her some hints, I think. What if I don't want to lie to her? Then don't. It's up to you. One way you get a lot of questions you can't answer. The other way you don't. - What about my questions? - Like what? What the hell am I doing here? You're seeing your wife. How long am I gonna be here? Till we're ready for you. Let me tell you something. In a few minutes you'll be smelling the flowers, breathing the clean air and having a drink with a very pretty woman. If I were in your shoes, I think I'd forget about those questions for a little while. That Volkswagen down there is yours. We'll be in touch. Meanwhile, enjoy yourself. Well, I can't believe it. I just can't believe you're sitting here. After I got out of prison I rented a place in San Rafael. It was about as close as I could get to where you were. I was there for over a year. A woman named Johnson let me have a room for next to nothing. She was a seamstress. And she was a... She was a widow and when her husband was alive, they'd been farmers and so, she liked to talk about crops and raising chickens. I don't... I'm sorry. I don't mean... I missed you so much. Here's your money, Mr. Waldron. Four thousand colons. You will find the money buys a lot down here. I may be buying some real estate. If I do, I'd need a great deal of cash out of my account. I just go through the same procedure? A simple request with your signature. Just as you have done today. Thank you vey much. I'm interested in flights to Rio. Rio de Janeiro? To Rio de Janeiro, there are two flights each day. At eight hours and nineteen hours. Change aircrafts in Panama City. One hour delay there. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. I reallly want it to last, Roy. Yeah. Do you know when you'll get your new trial? No, you know these things take time, you know. It takes a while to set it up. Yeah, I guess that it would. You know, all the time I was locked up then after when I got out, I had it in my head that people like us could never get a fair shake. Feel real good about everything now. I never thought I could feel this good. Neither did I. Yeah! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, sir. I am captain Ruiz with the Office of the Inmigration at Puntarenas. It is the standard procedure to register your passport. Does that mean I've done something wrong? No, no, no, no. Just formality. - Just formality. - Yes. Just a minute. What are you doing? There's a guy from Inmigration wants to see my passport. Is it trouble? No, it's just red tape. Go back to sleep. Can't go home if you're going by the mill cause the bridge washed out, at the bottom of the hill. The big creek's up and the little creek's level and I'll plow my corn with the devil in the shovels. Stay all night, stay a little longer. Dance all night, dance a little longer. Pull off your coat and throw it in the corner. Don't see why you don't stay a little longer. You know, I never thought that I would see a place like this. You sing wonderful! It beats the hell out of West, by God, Virginia. Well, you know it beats any place. It's just too perfect here. No, no, it's just perfect enough. Hello, there. We made ourselves at home. Hope you don't mind. Afraid we used some of your coffee, too. Well, that's all right. I'm sorry, Mrs. Tucker. I don't think you've met general Reser. Tom Reser. Marine Corps retired. - And you know Rose Pine. - How do you do? Well, you two look like different people. Puntarenas must agree with you. Well, we like it fine. It's so pretty in everything. Well, I guess that you all have things to talk about. I'll go clean up and make some fresh coffee. Okay, honey? We've had trouble getting in touch with you, Tucker. - No problems, Ross. - Yes, problem. That's not the way it works. You're not doing us a favour. You're just a pair of hands to us. - The thing... - That's enough, Ross. - What does he mean by that? - It's all right. No, it's not all right. What does he mean by that? I mean we're involved in something far more important than your honeymoon. That's personal. You don't seem to understand. Nothing for you is personal, not now. - Look, you bastard! - Take it easy! Ross, let's not forget who we are and what we're doing! Come on out here with me. I'll bring you up-to-date on a few things. Come on. Let me... Let me tell you something about Pine. He's a brilliant young man. One of the best minds I've ever known. I don't want him on my back! I don't blame you. I don't blame you at all. But he's young! You can see that. And impatient. He's a snob, too. He thinks anybody who isn't as smart as he is isn't worth listening to. And since hardly anybody is as smart as he is. See what I mean? I don't give a damn how smart he is! I don't want to listen to him blow. We're flying back to California this afternoon. You'll be coming with us. - Whereabouts? - Los Angeles, this time. But we'll land in Long Beach. How long is that for? I guess a week, ten days. Maybe less. I expect the situation to develop fast. Now, before you hit me with a lot of questions, let me tell you something. I don't know the answers. None of us knows the whole thing. We just know pieces. - I don't even know pieces. - You will when the time comes. May be a problem about my passport. How do you mean? A guy from Inmigration came and picked it up. That's all right. Don't worry about it. All you need's an entry card. We'll fix that. You mean some countries you need a passport to get in and out, and some countries you don't? That's right. If I wanted to go to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, for example, I'd need a passport to go there. Bea and Pearce. Her husband's name is Pearce. They watched over me like I was their kid. The only person game me any static was a guy called Fred Bazley. He was kind of like, he thought he was God's gift to women. And he took one look at me and figured I was real easy pickings. How about a drink? Let me, let me fix you a drink. But I told him, you know, that I just wasn't interested and then Bea, you know, Bea told him in no uncertain terms, she said that I was not on the menu, you know. You know Bea. She has a real funny way of putting things. Here you are. Thank you. I just don't want you to think I'm some big-eyed kid from the sticks, you know. I know how to take care of myself. Thank you, sir. I'm just calling Bea in San Bernardino. She'd kill me if she knew we were here. Yeah. Operator, never mind. We'll place the call later. Why'd you do that? Well, use your head, honey. What do you mean? Sometimes it doesn't pay to advertise. Bea's my cousin. She's on our side. She's not going to tell anyone. You don't know that. Well, I do. I know Bea! I just don't want your talking to her. Yeah. I just don't understand why not. Can we drop it? What's going on, Roy? Can we drop it? Yeah. We can drop it. - Good morning. - Good morning. Here is what you've got to do. About seven thirty, take a cab to the west side of the Forum parking lot. That's the west side of the Forum. Then, what? A car will be there to meet you. It doesn't make any sense to me. What do you mean? Who are you guys? Who do you work for? What are you after? What's so funny? Who could these men be? What were they talking about? He lived in a country with a legal Constitution. All the laws were enforced. Did you ever hear of Franz Kafka? - No. Who's that? - Nobody. Just a guy. You reminded me of him for a minute. Look. This is the way it has to be done. You're in a tricky situation. But I want to ease it for you if I can. But one thing you have to remember. It's like a train going downhill. You either ride it or it runs over you. You can't go it alone. None of us can. Let's go, Mr. Tucker. Hop in. This is a good spot, Lenny. Hold it here. Push those cans out the door, Tucker. Here's your rifle. There are ten cans out there. If you get them in twenty cracks, I'll be happy. Ten out of twelve! That's beautiful! You get the kewpie doll. Okay, Lenny. Coming up. All right. I'm on it. Okay, Lenny. Let's go. How'd it go? Fine, till a couple of minutes ago. - What's that supposed to mean? - He says he won't do it. - He says what? - Ask him yourself. What's he talking about? - I won't do it. - Yes, you will. You're part of the plan. And the plan's in motion. Not with me it isn't. Tucker, listen to me. There are three... Now you listen. Do you think I'm some kind of a dim-wit? I was in prison but I wasn't buried. We had newpapers there. There's no loose ends. We've covered everything. It's full of loose ends! It's dynamite, it's gonna blow up in your face. You don't think we're gonna let you walk away from this, do you? Let me put it this way. I've done a lot of things in my time. A lot of them I didn't want to do. You people make me sick. I won't do it. Now, are there any questions? No, none. Never have been any. Ellie? Did you get that done for me? Excuse me. Would you check ten thirty-five for messages? - I'm sorry. - Nothing. Would you check, for the other key, please? There's nothing in ten thirty-five. Sorry, Mrs. Cameron. You know where the police station is? Hop in, Mac. You can't go it alone. Come on. We'll be leaving here in exactly one hour. Tagge and I will ride along in the car with you. One of us will be with you all the time till we get back to this house. Which should be about 8:00. Another stupid move... Anything to sidetrack the work we have to do this morning and we'll kill your wife. Now it's crucial that you understand that. Do you? Yeah. That I understand. - Is the road shut off? - Tight as a cork. Both ways. We'll be over the target at seven on the button. Okay, Tucker, here's your clip. Now, move into position. Okay, Lenny, freeze it. Now! Now! Do it now! All right, let's get outta here, Lenny! Lenny's hit! Lenny's caught a round. We're gonna try to land down by the lake. Get the hell out there and pick us up. Okay, Tucker. Move it! Go to hell, general! This guy's bleeding to death. You stay here, you stay dead! All right, move it! - Any problems on the way back? - No. - What's the word from the compound? - Jay checked in at 7:10. He was dead when they fished him out of the pool. - Any announcement yet? - They know something's up. The CBS morning news reported... What happened to my wife? Where is she? We got 3 television sets... I don't care about your television sets! Where's my wife? It's all right, Tucker. Let me give you some advice. I don't want any of your chickenshit advice. I want to see my wife now. Don't tell me what you want. Nobody cares what you want. Look, we need radio. Nothing on the network, but we've got to... Put it away. Put it away! Yours, too. Now! In five minutes I'm gonna slice his throat. And every five minutes after that. If my wife isn't here in half an hour, I'm gonna cut his throat out. Is that clear? All right. Thanks. - What about the plane? - Burbank airport. It's ready when you are. I want a weapon. I want a regular car and I want you to drive it. I don't want that meat wagon with the doors that won't open. Now you, over there. I'm sorry. There's your plane. The things you asked for are in your bags. Who's going with us? Just the pilot. Would you excuse us for just a minute? I want to talk to Tagge. Listen. I fired ten feet short. I never touched that guy. Then you fooled me. I figured you'd do anything to save her. So'd I. Well, one way or the other, he's dead. Well, I know that. But if I didn't shoot him, who did? Remember what I told you once? We never put all our money on one horse. What does that mean? It means there were two other guns there. On the ground. They fired when you did. Matter of fact, one of those men was your cellmate, Oscar Spiventa. - Spiventa? - That's right. - You're crazy. - No, I'm not crazy. He's our man. I recruited him myself in 1961. No, Spiventa's dead. I saw him shot. No, you didn't. You just thought you did. How long you been manipulating me? A long time. Since Hawaii. - Doctor Applegate? - That's right. Doctor Applegate. Jesus Christ! - Tell me one thing. - Go ahead. Is it over? I don't know. The bigger the stink the more there is to cover up. And the man who worries the most is the man who gave the original order. If he panics, the dominoes start to fall. Hey! Open up! Let's go. Hey, don't take off! Hold on! Hold on! What's the matter? Nothing. Stay out of it. I told you not to take off! Hold it! If we can't tell each other the truth, we don't have anything. Do you think I believed that somebody got you out of jail just because they thought you deserved a fair trial? Do you think I believed that whole story you told me in Fresno? I knew you killed Riggins and so did the jury. But I pretended because I knew you wanted it that way. You didn't care what they thought so long as I thought you were innocent. But that was important to me at the time. I know you want to protect me. But you can't protect me from you. I don't want that kind of protection. I don't need it. Make-believe's not good enough any more. All right. We've got to tell each other the truth! - Okay. - Both of us. Listen. You listen to me. I lied to you before. About being with a man. It was that friend of Bea's husband I told you about. - Don't say. - I'll say it! Don't say that. Don't say it. I didn't want to do it and I felt awful about it afterwards. But I did it anyway. And I did it more than once! Listen. Listen, I didn't kill Riggins. I know you didn't believe me. I know you think I did. I've lied to you about a lot of things. But I'm not lying to you about that. I didn't kill him. I didn't. Oh, my God! It's embarrassing for me, sir. A fire in the office. A packet of papers and passports completely destroyed. But lucky for you, sir. Your Consulate here will fix it. I am sure they will make up a duplicate passport for you at once. Goodbye, sir. I'm sorry, sir. Sir? I could do nothing. The same man who deposited the money came and drew it out. Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! He's here. We'll go up the beach side. Salami, cheese, pickles in a barrel. I can't get it straight in my head. Why'd they have to hurt her? I never had a chance to do anything for her. I never even told her how I felt about her. Not the way I wanted to. When they wreck everything you've got when you see there's no way you can win. You end up saying to yourself, what the hell am I fighting for? That's what they count on. They figure sooner or later you'll give up. But, Jesus, if you're gonna do that, you might as well be dead. I can't give up.
