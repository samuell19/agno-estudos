Running a dog shelter, who would have thought? My club practically runs itself, all I have to do is pop in from time to time. By the way, I have to visit Brzózki soon. Some official stuff needs to be sorting out. Except the doggies need me here! Oh come on, I need you here as well! How badly? Very, very badly. Specifically, I need you to help me put the dogs in their crates. Anything else, Madam? Yes, love me forever and ever. I thought you had a real challenge for me. Stay faithful? I am forgiving, but you know infidelity is where I draw the line. Still waiting for an actual challenge! I got it. Remember to put the toilet seat down. How about an easier challenge? Get a room you two, the animals are watching! This is a respectable shelter. For respectable animals. Behave yourselves! Or, I don’t know, get married! Married? Maybe it’s not a bad idea. Us getting married, that would be the end of the world! Good morning, Marian. Hello. Did you have a good trip? How’s the traffic? Not too bad. Okay, bye! Sweet Jesus and Mary! Unresponsive, not breathing. Son, I think she’s… God… Mirror! Hand me a mirror. A priest… She’s alive! But she’s asked for a priest. Mummy, please wait up just a moment. Just one moment. Oh my. Now what? Hurry up, I beg you! Or Grandma might not make it! We should call the parsonage! It would have been quicker this way. You don’t just call a priest. Is not a police department. It’s not right. Faster, the parson has overtaken us! My sweet darling boy. My dear Piotr. Go to sleep, get some rest and don’t get stressed about any of this. Your wifey is leaving for work now. Halinka will make you a breakfast, okay? Remember to walk the dogs when you wake up, will you? Will you? I will. Excellent! You’re so conscientious. You’re such a dear hardworking thing. Bye. Right, okay. When I’m back in the evening, we’ll open a bottle of bubbly and watch some adult movie about love. Not a shoot ‘em up? I’d prefer something about killers. Okay, I’ve got an idea. -How about The Four Tankmen and the Dog? -All four of them? Okay. The tankmen will be fine so long as we watch it together, darling. Now, aren’t I just a spitting image of Ariana Grande? Through this sacrament of extreme unction and sacerdotal prayer… I ask God’s protection for all of the Church. Sweet Jesus and Mary! -Good morning, Father. -Good morning! -Well, what are you doing here? -What do you mean? -Mom, you asked for a priest! I thought-- -You thought I was dying? Come on, what was I supposed to think? Marcin heard you, you mentioned a priest. I was just telling you about a dream. I dreamed our priest was flying a helicopter. I must have dropped off and not finished the sentence. Father, have you bought a helicopter? We’re raising money to buy a copper roof for our church, so first things first. Well, yet again it would seem I’m not needed after all, Mrs Solska! Thank you very much, Father, and apologies for the trouble. I’ll walk you back, Father. -God bless you, Mrs Solska. -God bless you, Father. -Bag? -God bless you son. -You gave us such a fright. -Really? You don’t believe me, Mom? My dearest, you must be sick and tired of me. Mom, I want you to live forever. I find that difficult to believe! But there’s absolutely no way that I’m dying, before Marcin gets properly married in a church. So maybe I should never get married. To keep you living forever, Granny. What have we got here, a comedian! I’m sorry… Yes. That would be excellent. Hey! Look what you’ve done?! Me?! You should learn to park your car properly! Zofia, hop out. Come on, move your car. I need to unload my cargo. They’ll wait for it, if they really need it. I’m calling the police. Call away! Come in. Good morning! Who let you in here?! The county hall is open to the public today. And that means us. You're not the public! You are hooligans! Have you forgotten how you pelted me with tomatoes? I haven’t and never will! We've come here to apologize. I realize, that we caused irreparable moral damage. But we’ll repaint the facade and your house will look like new. Also, these are perfectly good tomatoes, not like ones we pelted you with. The same as these eggs. Perfectly fresh and GMO-free. Cholesterol-free, too. Eggs? -Cholesterol-free eggs? -Absolutely nothing in them. I can't accept that. What do you mean you can't? This is a bribe and I have my principles. Just tell people some chickens came along and laid eggs on your desk. Chickens? I mean, admittedly, this would not be unusual behavior for chickens. Okay. Let’s act like your terrorist attack never happened. Thank you for your understanding, chief. It’s kind of you. One more thing. We’ve decided to become whistleblowers. For our country! What do you mean, whistleblowers? We saw public service announcements encouraging people to report irregularities. We volunteer to tell you about any irregularities that come to our attention. -What kind of irregularities?! -Major ones. Like that Building Inspector lady. Bożena Dudała. Have you missed me? Good morning. It actually is kind of good. |It could get even better. -Really? -I’d like it to. I hope you’d like that too. Nobody forgets you in a hurry. I knew it! I’ve put some champagne in the fridge. I’ll be waiting! Hi! You left your packed lunch on the counter. Darling. Here, have some. You're not getting enough healthy food. -130. -Ouch, somebody’s getting a ticket. Good morning, officer. And good morning to you, officer. It doesn’t seem to be so good for some people. Police Officer Iwona Ząb. You’ve committed a traffic offence. You exceeded the maximum speed by 80 km/h in a built-up area. Your driving license please. But this is not a built-up area. Do you see this traffic sign, Madam? This sign says you've entered a built-up area. Hundreds meters before this spot. This place might grow into a metropolis. It is our duty to prepare the citizenry for that eventuality. Your papers please. Thank you. -What are you doing? -I’m seizing your driving license. You have no right to do that! According to Section 135, Clause 1, Subclause 1-A of the Traffic Act, quote: “A police officer may seize an offender’s driving license in the following cases: A - Exceeding the speed limit in a built-up area by more than 50 kmph.” But how am I supposed to get back to town? I know, he’ll give me a ride. -Stop him. -No, no. -Marcin! -Stop! -Keep going, keep going! -Marcin! -Easy, just go, go, go. -Go, go, go. Keep going. Marcin! Now, there's no need for him to stop. In their great wisdom, the legislators make it legal for a driver, whose license has been seized, to continue to drive for another 24 hours from the said seizure. And then what? My recommendation would be long walks and public transportation. For the next three months. Nobody’s home. Help! Help me! Please relax. These dogs are harmless. This is not doggies, this is monsters! Please don't call them names. They’re very clever, they understand everything. This is Epicurus, and this is Socrates. Doesn’t matter! I don’t want to know them. Dogs and I don’t get along. What are you doing here?! I live here. Impossible. -Yes it is. -Oh no! Yes, it is. No way, it’s impossible, because I live here. -I live here. -What? I’m actually moving in right now! Right now! You called me, Chief? I did indeed. Indeed. Take a seat, please. Here you are. What is this? Your notice of termination. Effective immediately. I don't understand? Oh, you do, Madam, you understand very well. Rumors have been circulating about certain irregularities, but we had no evidence. Finally somebody’s decided to blow the whistle. To speak out. About what? About your working methods. Unconventional methods. Illegal methods. This nothing but nonsense and slanderous rumors. You know well that… my conscience is crystal clear! Or should we say, clear like a diamond? It has come to my attention, that you’ve been taking bribes, including diamonds. Unfortunately, you won't be able to sing that song about diamonds… being a girl's best friend. What really shocked me, was that you also accepted favors of a different kind. That, I found genuinely surprising. A beautiful woman like you, shouldn’t have to stoop to such dirty tricks. Please pack up your things and leave this County Hall immediately. Obviously, expect charges to be pressed. The prosecutor’s office will contact you soon. Goodbye. Goodbye! Bożena? It’s like… we keep bumping into each other today! Don't talk to me! We’re not on first name terms anymore! What do you think? That I don't know exactly what you did. You bastard! You damn snitch! Stay away from me, understood? I don't want to look at you… you impotent thing. Impotent? What were you even thinking? Did you think I would just leave it like that? Traitor. You and your family are all done for. Shoo, shoo! Go away! Get away! So, what now? I talk to them but, they don’t understand anything. Go away! Take the dogs away. Take the dogs away. Socrates. Socrates. So, my understanding is that… you work here for my daughter, right? I don’t work. And who is your daughter? My daughter is my daughter. -Does she have a name, perhaps? -Of course she does. Everybody has a name. What a silly question? Jesus, domestic staff in Poland are not terribly bright. My daughter’s name is… Marlena Zawadzka. What? No! That’s not actually her name. Well, I should know the name of my own daughter. Excuse me. Actually, I don't think you do. Her name is Marlena… Wolańska. Oh my gosh, she got married? Again? 15 years ago. To me. Welcome home, mother-in-law! Lunch? Just like that? Can't we invite you to lunch just like that? Of course you can, but… -you never have before… -We must make up for the lost time. Agnieszka has been scouring the internet for recipes for week. Really? My daughter should stay well away from the kitchen! -Hello Grandma. -Hello. Come here, darling. Wait a second. So nice of you to drop by. Mom has made tea. We have some delicious cake. Please sit down with us for a moment. I don’t want to look at that lover of your mother’s. It's bad for my digestion. But you always liked him. I actually did like him, back when he was still Professor Wolański. Well, who is he now? A Cassandra and he’s over 70. You mean Casanova? That's what I said, didn’t I? You can see for yourself the kind of person he is. So, you're not coming to lunch at our place, are you? To visit you and Agnieszka? Why ever not? I would cancel my own funeral plans to visit you! Except, Granny… Agnieszka’s father will be coming too. I will tolerate him at your place. These are extraordinary circumstances! But tell me, Marcin, when are you planning to get married? It weighs on me that you two are living in sin. You promised me. Granny, if you come to us for lunch, you may find out more. That means I will live to see your wedding. Thanks be to God. Marcin, shouldn’t you go directly and ask the priest to publish the banns? Granny, this is a big secret for the time being. Nobody knows about it, except you and me. Don’t worry, a priest isn’t going to tell anyone. Granny, this is not right. Do you want us to get married… under compulsion? All I'm trying to do is offer moral support. 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Here you are-- I mean, here you are… Lord. Five thousand to make sure, that the County Chief goes to hell. I’ll throw in another five thousand, if he goes to hell quickly. That would cover the cost of that copper roof. This is to make sure they give me my license back soon. And this… is about Marcin Zawada. I want that scrawny girl to ditch him. Just make sure she ditches him. Immediately. The date is booked. All we need now is your fiancée and in God’s name we can publish the banns. Father, come on, can’t you announce it this Sunday? More haste, less speed. I just want to live to see the day. You’ll live to see it. You will outlive me. How many times have I given you extreme unction? I don’t remember. I’m never awake when that happens. Exactly. So, if the fiancée comes here next week we can go ahead with the wedding plans… a month from now. A month? Did you hear that, dear boy? One month from now. -God bless you all. -Thank you. -May God repay you. -May God repay you. That’s doing business with God for you. A wedding? Not before the end of the world. Good morning. On behalf of the Management of Palace Residence, I wish you a very nice day. Thank you. I’m here to see my mom. Mrs Wolańska is not there. Neither is the dog. She's away since month now. I tried to call her recently, but… there's no answer. Yes, I’ve also been trying to get in touch with her. Unsuccessfully. Okay, thank you. On behalf of the management, I wish you a very nice day. Goodbye. Marcin? Marcin! I can’t believe it. You’re cleaning. As you can see. I see. I just can’t believe it. Apparently, men are not fully mature until the age of 30. So I’m all grown up and ready to clean! On the day we’re expecting an inspection from my Mom, Grandma, and your parents. About that… My Mom’s not coming. I don’t know what happened, she’s disappeared and can’t be reached. Is it okay if I don’t act all worried? You! Ouch! What’s wrong? Oh no, my little baby girl is hurt. Wait, we can sort this out. Show me. -Oh my. -What is it? -Half your finger’s missing! -What!? Stop it. - It’s not funny. - Here. Okay, what do we need to get ready for the lunch? Piotr, darling! - Piotr, darling! - I’m here. God, I’ve missed you so much baby. I’ve been thinking about you all day long. Especially when I was walking past Vitkac. Who comes up with names like this for a department store? Marlena, baby, it’s because… I couldn’t resist buying a few lovely things for you. Just look at this. Reduced from 4500 to 3900. An absolute steal. -But you know what? -Look at this… pair of gold trousers, aren’t they fabulous? I had to get it in XL size. They keep making the L size smaller. -No idea why. -But Marlena… But I know you don’t want your wifey to spend money on you, But baby, this is pure pleasure for me. Really. Darling, I wanted to tell you. That you love me. I know. I know, I love you too, darling, I love you more than anything. I’ve never loved anyone as much as I love you, baby. Wonderful, wonderful. So’ve you never loved your own mother as much as this dingbat?! Sweet Jesus and Mary, baby, who’s this? I tried to tell you…Who is this? -Who is this? -Come on, who is this?! To think I crossed the Atlantic to hear this kind of thing! People! I’ve nurtured a snake in my own bosom. If you can’t recognize your own mother, I’m disowning you, my child! That’s it! You are not my daughter any more! Mommy? Damn right it’s mommy! Goodness, mommy, so you’re still alive? Damn right I’m alive, unless I die of irritation because of you! Come here! My baby! -My dear child! -Mommy! Well, it’s Mommy now. Moment ago you wished me dead! I just can’t believe you’re here, my beautiful, wonderful Mommy! I can’t believe it! It’s me! Blood of my blood! My child! My blood! It’s perfect. Into the fridge it goes. And we’re done. You’re really amazing, actually. Can I have that in writing, please? I’ll show it to you the next time you catch me at night watching The Four Tankmen. I can put up with Four Tankmen. But getting a box set of Amazing Police Dog was a bit much. If you don’t let me watch it tonight, I’ll show your crème brûlée to everyone. That’s a low blow! Thank you. Mommy, I’ve had no sign of life from you for 15 years. You never answered my letters, your old phone number was dead, what was I supposed to think? That’s no reason to assume your mother was dead! Here. Yes, actually. That you’d joined the choir invisible. Not only did I not join the choir invisible, I actually got married! And followed my husband from Chicago to Texas. Here. In that case, why didn’t you invite me to your wedding? For what? They would have never let you into the United States. Have you forgotten about your visa ban? For being damned stupid? Here. Damned stupid? You mean for being honest. I told them everything, like it was in that visa application. I said I missed my mom and wanted to stay with her in America. My gosh, who do you take after being so naïve? It must be your father. Certainly not me. What made you jump to the conclusion that your mother was dead? I would have let you know, if I was dead. Also, did you invite me to your wedding? How was I supposed to do that! I didn’t have your current phone number or even your new address. Do you have any idea how bad it made me feel? I cried and cried because you weren’t with me on my wedding day. I had nobody to walk me down the aisle! It was your third wedding, wasn’t it? You must have known the way well enough to get there without any help! Third wedding, big deal. Luckily, you’re here now. You will stay with us and I will take excellent care of you. It will be nice and comfy for you. Wait. Are you saying you want me to stay here, with your family? Yes! No way. I won’t be here long, anyway. Oh my God. Mommy, have you come back to die in the old country? What are you, stupid? Who’s dying here? You can die all you like, but I have no such intentions! I’ve come here to visit my fiancee. What? My own wedding is taking place in a week! - What?! - That’s right! No way! Did you manage not hurt yourself now? If you tell anyone what happened here, I’ll tell everyone you watch Little Mole before sleep. Come on. You know the Little Mole is my secret. Promise you won’t tell anyone. Ahoj! Look, they’re so happy! We didn’t buzz to get in, somebody was leaving. What’s happened to you? See? What did I tell you? It could be worse. 42, 43, 44, 45. Mommy dear, isn’t that too much exercise? Child, I need to get in shape for my wedding! Here are some cookies. Cookies! Fifty. Ok. Enough. -These are not light -Oh, it doesn’t matter. Good. Very good! -You didn’t bake these yourself? -Of course I didn’t! Halinka baked the cookies. It doesn’t matter that you don’t bake. It’s good you have domestic staff. A woman’s role is to lie on a couch and smell nice. Not to be stuck in the kitchen. In your case it’s the other way around, isn’t it? What? Your husband. He does the lying around and smelling nice part. Okay guys, I go to sleep. The jet lag is catching up with me. -Bye, bye. -Bye, bye. Tomorrow, you must help me. -Yes? -I need your help. We need to choose a wedding dress for me. -Wedding dress? -Yes, of course! I couldn’t make up my mind and ended up buying seven. What?! That’s right! Seven? Seven wedding dresses? That’s freaking awesome. I love catwalk shows. If I hadn’t chosen philosophy, I would have been a stylist, probably. Or a designer. -What do you think about that? -Why? Well, what? All designers are gay! What’s the big deal, my ex-husband and his Oscar are gays and yet they’re excellent skiers. This is not a politically correct thing to say. Here is the same? Next thing it’s wrong is to pat someone’s ass? Well, it’s not the done thing. But my Piotr is allowed to. I get worried when he doesn’t give me some quality slaps. I always ask him, what’s wrong, baby? Isn’t that right? O Jesus! Agnieszka. I’m so full. I can hardly stand up. Please stay where you are and wait a moment. Now that’s we’re all here Together I would like to… Agnieszka. I love you very much and can’t imagine living without you. Will you marry me? I’m so happy! At last! I think I’m going to cry. Yes. I love you. Thank you for the wonderful time. Marcin, you and Agnieszka must come to Brzózki soon. You know what I mean. To finish the business. What business is that, Marcin? You booked a date for a church wedding? Before you even proposed? Don’t you think that’s a bit… - Surprising? - More than that. Deep down I felt you were going to say yes. Especially given you proposed to a poor disabled girl with crushed fingers. What a noble gesture. Although that still doesn’t trump the culinary triumph you gave me today. I hope that's not the only reason you agreed to marry me. Reasons were completely different. I have very serious intentions towards you. What kind of intentions? My intentions are to have my way with you, relentlessly. Wait, we should do the dishes first. I'll do the dishes tomorrow. -Promise? -Promise. Get up Marcin or we're going to be late! Just a second! Here’s a little memento of our flights of passion. As always, Marcin, you were just divine. Until the next time. Yours, Bożena. Marcin! -Hey relax, I’m on top of this! -Is this what you’re on top of?! It's so beautiful here. So calm. Fascinating. I was an idiot to think I was a city person. Wait a second. Marian! Marian, what are you doing? Marian! This is for you. Thank you, Marian. Your mother is a new person. That’s because she's happy about Marcin’s wedding. -What time were they supposed to be here? -Two o’clock. -I'm a bit hungry. -I've prepped everything. I just have to put the potato dumplings in the pot. Lay the table, and I’ll see if they’re on their way. Hallo? Are you on your way? Yes Mom, but we made a late start and got stuck in traffic. Start cooking the soup, we’ll be there soon. Aga! -What did he say? -He told me to start cooking the soup. -Except… -Except what? Except he sounded like I'd just woken him up. Agnieszka! Don't even try to call me, I'm not picking up. The wedding is cancelled. It’s over. God, you’re here. Thank God. Hey, don't be so formal. Would you let me use your motorbike? Some idiot has damaged my Mustang. The door won't stay shut. Please. Quiet! It's a matter of life and death. I'll bring it back later. -Why did she leave? -How do you know? You’re wearing the desperate expression of a guy whose woman has left. -How do you know that look? -Sometimes I look in the mirror. Hey, man. Maybe we should just change tack about these things. You know what I mean. You’re single. I’m single. So we aren’t gay, but sex is not the only thing that matters in life. It's about having someone you can hug. So, you know, unless you’re a blanket hog… Look, this is a fantastic offer and I may take you up on it. But in the meantime let me try and tackle this crisis, okay? If you change your mind… Thanks! See you! What, not even a kiss? Damn it… Oh hello, sweetie. Where’s Marcin? Agnieszka, are you crying? We’ve broken up. Calm down, it’s normal for young people to quarrel. Even if they’re engaged. I've broken off the engagement! -Why not? -Because I've found out about something. -Has he got someone else? -Yes! -It’s Marcin. -I don’t want to talk to him. -Yes Marcin? -Mom, is Agnieszka with you? -She’s just come here. -I'm begging you, don’t let her leave. -I'll do my best. -I refuse to talk to him. Excuse me. Agnieszka. You shouldn’t be driving in this state! Agnieszka! Agnieszka! Agnieszka! -Marian, stop her. -Agnieszka! Get out! Agnieszka! Get out of the car! I knew this relationship was going nowhere. The guy had a weed plantation! Come on, it was just a few plants. Didn't you see that he changed his entire life for your daughter’s sake? That was the only thing that kept him out of prison! You’re being too harsh. Police Officer Iwona Ząb, Brzózki Police Station. Why are you going so slowly? Isn't that allowed? It is, but it is kind of slow. Can I help you? No, not in this case. Well, actually, the role of the police is to serve citizens in all kinds of cases. Thank you, you’re being very kind. I appreciate that, but not today. In that case please fasten your seatbelt and turn on your headlights. Yes. You seem to have forgotten. Yes, sorry. Agnieszka, please don't cry. Men are an evolutionary cul-de-sac. I know that. And actually, I wish I was like you, and didn't have to deal with this. But unfortunately, I've fallen in love with a man. Well, in that case I feel for you. Have a safe journey. Thank you. - Stop! Stop here! - Right here! Stop! What's the rush? Why are you in such a hurry? It's about my fiancee. Iwona, please. Let me go. I'm afraid you’re going to have to find a minute for a breathalyser check. Iwona, don't be silly, I haven’t drunk. That’s unhealthy. You should drink water. -Your papers, sir. -What do you mean, sir? We’re friends! I have no friends when I'm on duty. Tadek, the breathalyser. It's inside the car. On the back seat. Tadek, call the station in Grabowo! We have a chase situation! -Tell them to block the road! -I’m on it. Damn it! Because of you she got away from me! He have an individual who ignored a traffic stop. Bypassed a roadblock. And breached the physical integrity of a police officer on duty. Let me go or I’ll sue you for ruining my private life! Bloody troublemakers in blue! I’ll make you pay for this! I’m going to kill you! Well, look at that. Add threats to the list of charges. Here’s to our policing success! I’m going to kill you! I have no idea where they are, and I’ve quarelled with Marian. I could hear that from a mile away. What am I supposed to do now? Give him hell. Did you give dad hell every time you quarrelled? I don’t remember that. The thing is, me and your father, God rest his soul, we got properly married in church. But you two? A marriage certificate is not quite the same as a bicycle license. Anyway. Those were different times. Now women are in charge. Gender and stuff. How do you know about those things mom? From television. And you agree with that? We must move ahead with the times. Give him hell! I will not let that slide. What happened to Marcin? Did he have an accident? He fell off a motorbike when we tried to arrest him. Is he hurt? He’s been taken to the police station, because he and Krzystof had a bit of a scuffle. I mean, he assaulted a police officer on duty. My son did that? -Marcin Zawada? -That’s right. Marcin Zawada. Son of Katarzyna and Paweł. You don’t recognize me. But I remember you. You used to be my teacher. That’s right, Adam Majerski! You were quite a little devil, weren’t you! This is why, I decided to come over here and tell you all about this. I don’t think we’ll keep him detained for long, but if I were you I’d be looking for a lawyer. It’s that serious? He assaulted an officer. You heard him. - Was there a woman with him? - A woman? No. There was no woman. I would have noticed a woman for sure. This is Hans, the Texas husband I was telling you about. A very good husband. Very rich, very old and soon also very dead. An excellent husband. Never mind this one. This one’s nice, too. What about this one? Look at him. I mean, just look. When I saw that photo I was stunned. I froze. I thought, that's it. That's it. This one and no other. He will be my last husband. Mom, but you haven’t even met him! It’s a big decision, getting married. We’ve had online chats and everything. What do you mean? I mean we’ve talked, on a daily basis. Right. But mom, it’s not the same as an actual relationship. You know. I went to school with your father for a number of years. But in the end he was what? Terrible! Mommy dear, stop badmouthing Daddy! Baby, he was terrible. The best thing about him was how soon he ended up dead. -Mom, I’m begging you. -How about this one? He looks like a healthy specimen. Look at the size of this thing. A real man. -A real man. -And he’s rich. -Money isn’t the most important thing. -Now, now. That’s what poor people say. Every rich person knows it’s better to be rich than not. Right. I’ll get it! He knows how to open a door, I’ll give you that. Bravo. It’s something, isn’t it. Hey Agnieszka! Hi Sis. Hey Sis, what’s wrong? Are you crying? -Why? -Piotr, do you know where our Mom is? I’ve been trying to get in touch with her. Where is she? Our Mom? She’s fine. I think. Has she gone somewhere? Do you know where she is? I have to know! Piotr! Thank you again for your help, Adam. No problem. I just had to help my favourite teacher. Behave! Again, my apologies. I didn’t mean that stuff about killing you. -Killing them? -Goodbye. Goodbye. It’s a good thing the wedding has fallen through. Seriously? I don’t believe it. Our Mom loves surprises. Will they even let me in? I’m sure they’ll let you in. Getting out again might be another thing. Look, Sis. I’d be careful if I were you. You only live once. If anyone asks, don’t tell him where I went, okay? Agnieszka? I can smash his face in if you like. Just say the word and it’s done. Thanks. But that won’t be necessary. Not necessary? He’s made my sister cry, he deserves it. No, I should have made better choices in my relationships. But that’s okay. I will survive. I can handle this. And he can watch Amazing Police Dog all he likes. With that… Ms. Big Tits of his. Wait, have you got this on DVD? Yeah. Oh man, that’s so cool! Thanks. Bye, Sis. Wait a minute. Sis? What do you mean, Ms. Big Tits? I love Agnieszka more than anything. Help me win her back. After what you’ve done to her? You bastard! Agnieszka says she’s broken off the engagement, because you cheated on her. I just didn’t do the dishes when she asked. And I didn’t get up when she tried to wake me up. Is that all? Is that the reason for her hysterics? Marian, your daughter’s being oversensitive. I’m not even going to tell you the kind of rumours about your son. Wait, you go around people’s houses collecting nasty rumours about my son? I can’t believe you could do something like that. I never asked anyone. They told me of their own accord! I never thought your son would make my daughter suffer like that. Well, I didn’t expect your daughter would break up with my son because of unwashed dishes. Please don’t fight. Katarzyna, we’re going back home. -I’m not going anywhere! -Mom, go with him. I must find Agnieszka. And clear up this misunderstanding. I can’t imagine living without her. Mom, I have to go. Hello! Excuse me, is anybody there?! Could somebody open the gate please? Nobody’s going to open that gate for you now. Maybe in an hour’s time. They’re having their service now. With dancing, like. Very weird people. They’re not violent. But very weird. When the service and the dancing is over, do you think they’ll let me in? I’m not sure. I guess so. But… Just be careful in there, or they may never let you leave. There’s no telling what weird people can come up with. Apparently, they all walk around in the nude in there. Men and women. No telling what weird people like that can come up with. You tell me, isn’t that right? Just be careful in there. Right? Thank you. Please stop here. Kasia, is Marcin here? Kasia? I’m coming, Mom. I’m coming. You need to throw a massive wedding party. With all the bells and whistles. In my gardens, my restaurant will do the catering. With prawns, champers and what not. You can’t have the bubbly without prawns! -How many guests are we talking about? -Child, stop that nonsense! No one. Nobody’s coming. -What do you mean, nobody? -Nobody. But why? Because they’re all dead. They’re all dead. Only me and my fiance. Well excuse me, but I can’t help noticing that I’m alive, actually. -And our family. -What family? Our family are all dead. Well, what about my darling Piotr? Piotr has his parents and a sister. They have their loved ones, my two ex-husbands, one with his new wife, the other with his new husband. That’s family, actually. It could be your family but it certainly isn’t mine. -I’m sure you’ll love to meet them. -I’m sure I won’t. -No way. -You’ll fall in love with them. -What’s your fiancé’s name actually? -Come on, what’s his name? Come on. You don’t even know his name? When you’re my age you will sometimes forget things, too. Wait. It’s not an easy name. Bigos, bigos. Bigos. Bigos. Oh, Kapusta. Meaning cabbage. Leopold Kapusta. Kapusta. -What are you doing? -I’m going to look for Agnieszka. She’s in despair, she needs her father’s support. Maybe we should let them solve their own problems? They’re adults. But clearly not all grown up. Are you going to just leave like that? Kasia, don’t be so dramatic. You should think long and hard about what your son has done. Will I find my mom here? Am I supposed to come in there? Oh, I should sit down, right? Should I tie myself up like a pretzel or can I just sit like a normal person? Mommy! Let’s go! Wow. What a babe. That’s not surprising, actually. She’s my Mom! So cute. Mommy dear, this is a lovely dress and obviously you look divine. But isn’t it a bit much for a civil wedding? Nope. -No? -No. Too much? No! Well, okay. Maybe. Ok, no worries. Next one. And now? What you think? It’s wonderful. Isn't it? No? Okay. Next one. What about this? This one’s superb, isn’t it? Well, what? Come on, what is up with you? Okay, next one. Well, what? If you don’t like any of these, we’re in serious trouble here. Is she here?! We were supposed to get married! Leopold! Oh my gosh, you are soo young! Wonderful! You looked old in that photo! No, Mom. You can’t see me in my wedding dress! My wedding dress! You mustn’t! Well, you’ve seen it anyway, Come here, come here. Baby! You’re being silly, my daughter. Why are you crying? Not much of a loss, no need to cry. How can you say that Mom? I can. And I will. That’s the truth. I would forgive him everything except badmouthing my Marcin. And neither should you. You have to stand by your child. Even if he’s in the wrong? But Marcin has done nothing wrong. Agnieszka is a bit of a crybaby. The moody type. But you used to say she was so nice. That was before she started badmouthing Marcin. It’s different now. Now I don’t like her at all. That spinster! She’s caught such a beautiful young boy and she’s still making a fuss? And if her father unfairly sides with her we don’t need him around here. Didn’t you say we were supposed to side with our children? I meant our child, not somebody else’s. A daughter-in-law is not your real child. Enjoy your meal. Agnieszka? What are you doing here? Mom… I’m so glad I’ve found you. That’s a warm welcome! I’ve missed you, too. But what’s happened? I’ve broken up with Marcin. He’s cheated on me. He’s looking for me, I need a place to hide. And work it all out somehow. Regain my balance. Well, you couldn’t find a better place for it. Follow me. What have you done to her? -Nothing. -Nothing? She gave me no chance to explain. To apologize. She just ran away. -She must have had a reason. -What reason? That’s the thing. What reason? Ms. Big Tits? What do you mean, Ms. Big Tits? Well, who is she? There is no Ms. Big Tits. No Ms. Big Tits? So what is this about? That’s the thing. I don’t know! Mommy, you really are too emotional. The way you crushed him with your bosoms! I was sure he was Leopold, my fiance. He did mention a wedding. Aren’t you too much of an optimist? Marcin is not even 30. So what? Right. This time it must be Leopold. Come on. He mustn’t see me in my wedding dress. Where is she? I’m here! That's me. My dear. Agnieszka? What have you done to her? Come on Dad, this isn’t Agnieszka. It’s my Mom! Wait, stop it, Leopold is not your dad! Who’s Leopold? So, to sum up, I’m supposed to do the dishes, clean up. Pay overdue bills. Buy her flowers, wine, sushi. And apologize profusely. Exactly. And that will do the trick? Not exactly. There’s one more problem. -Which is… -The toilet seat. Remembering to put the toilet seat down Is one of life’s greatest challenges. Where is Agnieszka? Damn it, you must know that. -Hey, leave my daughter alone. -Wait. And stop screaming! But I don’t know, I have no idea. Maybe Marcin will know. Where is he? He's at the pool with my Piotr. You’re hiding him! -Dad, what makes even you think that! -He’s not your dad. I’ll make him pay for this. Pay for what? For making my daughter suffer! What a horrible family! Who is this? You want to invite those people to my wedding, my child? No way! You bastard! Dad! I didn’t do anything, I swear! You’re finished! I want to explain and to apologize to her! That’s why I’m looking for her! -Dad! -Still explaining yourself? You sex-maniac! Dad! You won’t find her! It seems like he’s about to kill somebody. You’re going to have a murder here. Right now. Call them! The police! Kapusta is here. Kapusta? Kapusta. Wait, at long last. Leopold? Exactly. It's you? Is that you? But… you looked different in the photo. Taller. Different. Advertising makes the world go round! But why are you dressed up as a cowboy? I’ve had a cowboy already! I’ve come here to get myself a Polish husband! Don’t come near her! Dad, I have no idea what you mean! Dad? You’re calling me Dad? Marlena, help. Quiet! Stand still! -Stop all this chasing around! -That’s more like it. Strong, decisive, That’s the kind of woman I need. Give me those photos back. I haven’t got any photos, actually. I’ve looked everywhere. You must have hidden them somewhere. To cover for Marcin. But what has Marcin done, actually? He cheated on Agnieszka with that Building Inspector with the big tits. Wait, how do you even know that? It was in the photos. Were those photos, like, polygraphic? Pornographic, yes. Almost. Jesus, Mary and Saint Joseph. My little Marcin. Involved in polygraphy. I swear to God. I’ve never even seen those photos. I put them in my handbag and now they’re not here. Perhaps that Cassandra of yours took them? Casanova! Mom! Or maybe Marian did find them, and took them? If he finds Marcin, he’s going to kill him. Kill him dead. Mom, those horrible photos. He’s totally naked, and so is she. -I must talk to her. -No! This is evidence. This naked guy in the photos? That’s not me. So why is your lover sending you photos of somebody else? She’s not my lover, she must be crazy! She may be crazy, but just look at the tits on her. Hey, hey, hey. Next photo you don't see. Don’t look. The guy is always shown from the back. You can’t see his face. Just see for yourselves. I can't. This could be anyone. So, you’re saying this is not your butt. But I don’t believe you. Agnieszka would have recognized it. I believe him, Dad. The butt does look kind of fake. It looks pretty authentic to me. -Be quiet! -Why? From that side, I mean the backside, Marcin looks completely different. And how would you know that, my darling? If you’ll excuse me… -That’s right. -How do you know that? -We were in the pool just now! -Yeah, right. You see, a wannabe designer! A mole! I got it! A mole! This guy has a mole on his left butt cheek. Without glasses I can't see. Is there a mole there? There is one, actually. -Yes, that’s right. -That’s right. And I don’t! Can you see a mole here? Thank you. You haven’t seen the last of me! She’s lost her mind… First of all, there is one important thing we need to clear up. Dad, are you sure Agnieszka has seen those photos? I’m not sure. I found those photos in Kasia’s handbag. -Oh my. -Hey, that’s not cool, daddy boy. He’s not your daddy! It was an… emergency. Leopold, don’t you ever put your hand in my handbag. Never ever. Even after our wedding. If there’s a wedding in the first place. Remember that. I understand that your engagement is in crisis, but can we go back to saving my relationship? -Of course, you’re right. -What? Are you telling me off? In my own house? With all due respect, Mom, this is not your house. -And I’m not your Mom. -I can’t even. I really like it here. Never a dull moment! -Are we going to live here, darling? -Really? Will you live with us? God, this is so wonderful. -I’m so happy. -Listen, my darling daughter. Mommy! Marcin. Let’s get the hell out of here. This calls for a stiff drink. I’m coming with you guys. Well, but he could be my Dad. Thing is, I miss my Dad so badly! Marcin is not taking my calls. I must find him and warn him. Jesus, Mary and Saint Joseph She’s going to kill him. That insane deviant. -Kasia, save him, I am begging you. -I’ll do whatever I can. And take care! I will. I’ve asked the Goździks to act as your bodyguards. Bodyguards? What’s the point? Who would want to kill an old woman like me? Seeing as she tried to kill me, she might be capable of anything. Here we are! Mrs Zawada, we’re at your service! Take care. You can count on us. Thanks very much. Have you got cards? Cards? Yeah, cards, cards. I’ve got it. Let’s take a photo of your butt and then carry out a comparative study of the two butts. Yours and the one in the photo. It’s just we don’t have that photo. Now you’re talking. -Show me the butt. -Right on, Dad. Hold still a moment. Ok. One more, a bit closer. Got it. This one sticks out less. And that one has the mole. I must agree they're clearly different. As far as I’m concerned, you’re proven innocent. I’m going to add this photo to my favourites just in case. As evidence proving my brother-in-law’s innocence. Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t put my phone on silent. Oh, Jesus Christ. Come on, child. You’ve broken my flow. You’ve simply wrecked the aura. We will have to start again. Piotr? “It’s not his butt”. What? How come? I don’t know. Piotr says it’s not. Oh my child, do you not recognize your own boyfriend’s butt? Come on, girl. “Sis, Marcin is innocent. He didn’t cheat on you. He doesn’t have a mole.” He doesn’t have a mole? Does he have one or not? I don’t think so. -I feel like you’ve misled me. -Don't be petty, my dear. The body is just our outward appearance. What counts is the soul. And the heart. Mommy. I think that Leopold is right. After all, it’s what’s inside that’s most important. That's why your husband is… How many? Ten years younger than you? Right? Because of his inner beauty? Or is it something else? In the ad, Leopold, you put 187 cm. As your height, right? And you are a short man. You sent a photo! Who is in that photo? It ain’t you! You simply aren’t the goods that I ordered. Honorata, I feel like I’m being treated like an object. And that’s my dad in the photo, God rest his soul. So it’s almost me. Oh, almost, almost! Makes a really big difference! You are a liar. You’re a cheat. Leopold. A cheat. Mommy, love is all that matters. Aha. Of course, only love. If he’s 30 cm shorter, then my love is 30 cm shallower. Let’s not sweat the small stuff, my dear. Love is love. And I fell in love with you at first sight. Mommy, wait! Mommy. Macau… And I’ve won the game! God damn, the cards are coming up trumps for you. But aren’t you doing a little cheating? Me, cheating? And who’s got the Jack of Diamonds up their sleeve? I have no idea know how that trump got up there! Mrs Solska, you shouldn’t cheat like this. It’s a sin. Sweet Jesus and Mary! What’s going on? It’s her! My Kasia was right, she wants to kill me too. Calm down, woman. Of all people we should know that you can’t kill someone with flowers or tomatoes, or eggs. She’s gone completely mad. Zenek, or is it actually us that she’s mad at? Mad at us, how so? Because we went to the Chief, as whistleblowers. And he gave her the sack. You’re right. -Yes, maybe that’s it. -Jesus Christ. People might die because of what we’ve done! We’ll make it back home, Light up a proper fire, And we’ll feed the dog -Dogs! It’s dogs! We’ll get there before nightfall, All we have to do is win Because we’re playing A serious game with this war I’m enjoying myself here more and more. May I join you? -By all means. -There were four tankmen, weren’t there? Our loyal crew will return, The four tankmen Our tank and our dogs Mrs Wolańska and another Mrs Wolańska and… -Incarnation. -Right, Incarnation. What great fun you are all having. A son-in-law worthy of his father-in-law. Good for nothing. It’s not what you think. Oh yes? So what is going on, Marian? You’ve got together a band of revellers? Along with this cheat, who’s mistreating our daughter. He's been sharing pornographic photos. How could you, Marian? -But they’re not actually his photos. -No? I want to get everything straight with Marcin. I see, and you want to give him another chance. Remember, my child, sex is over-rated. Agnieszka, I'm sorry. I know, I’ve let you down again. But I swear I’ll do the washing-up, I’ll always remember to put the toilet-seat down. I’ll do anything for you, because I love you. I think that you can believe him. And so you should, Sis. Because in those pornographic photos, with Ms. Big Tits, it's not Marcin at all. Because he doesn’t have a mole on his butt. Sis, I can explain everything. Ms. Big Tits isn’t his piece of ass, because the ass in the picture is not his ass. Basically there’s nothing to discuss. But the most important thing is that we are all together and we should celebrate. Piotr, bring some bubbly from the fridge, three bottles. Marlena, no bubbly until Marcin and I have calmly got everything straight. I swear it’s not me in those photos. Okay then, let’s suppose it’s not you. Then why did she send them to you? How am I supposed to know? She’s crazy! With very attractive tits, though. Now, now. Leopold. Okay. Now look me right in the eyes and tell me the truth. Is there something between you and that woman? Is there something between you and that woman? -Come on! -Don't admit it. We did not have a relationship. Come on, Sis. It’s just like I told you. Right? There was no relationship, and that’s the end of it. -Who’s for red and who’s for white? -Nobody is drinking anything just now. -Did you sleep with her or not? -Did you sleep with her or not? Piotr, my son, please don’t get involved in these grown-up things. -Did you do it or not?! -Well, sleep together… In a bed, under the covers… Don’t admit it! Then no. Where then? You can see for yourself, child. Don't delve any deeper into it, Sis, please. Did you have sex with her? Answer the question! Don’t admit it! I did. But only once and it was before I met you, Agnieszka. It doesn’t count if it was before he met you! Oh really, now. You shouldn’t have admitted it… Grandma, Jesus Christ. It’s her again! -She tried to kill me. -But who?! She tried to kill me! Everybody, we need to call the police! Marian, do something, at least pretend to be a man! Oh my gosh. Who is it? -You will pay. -She needs help. For the humiliation. -Look out, child. -For the harm. I will kill you. I am a trained doctor, she needs mouth-to-mouth resuscitation at once. Did you hear? He’s a doctor. Oh, I see. In exchange for us not pressing charges of blackmail, reputational damage, fraud, damage to valuable property and assault and battery, will you confirm that these photographs have been tampered with and do not depict Marcin Zawada, who is here present. I agree. They don’t depict him? No. And do you also promise to stop slandering Marcin Zawada and saying he anonymously reported you to the authorities in Białkowo, which cost you losing your job there? I promise. In that case you may leave. Marian, you are so wise. Since when? -You didn’t tell me that you’re a doctor. -Veterinary medicine. Jesus Christ! Who says that women are the weaker sex. Is police assistance required here? How fast the police are in Poland. They show up before you’ve called them. Thank you, boys. Thanks. Thanks. Yes, super. That's it. Problem solved. She might have been crazy, but what a lovely figure. What? Leopold, you haven‘t seen anything in the tits department. Check these out. See? Ok, my dears, come along, come along. Champagne for everyone. Let’s have ourselves a garden party. Maybe we should place bets? I bet one hundred that they’ll make up. You’re on. -You see? -What? Not only is he a sex-maniac, he’s also a gambler. You know this wasn’t about The Four Tankmen or the washing up. We had a good life together. I mean, I don’t know about you But I certainly enjoyed it. So did I. Good, she’s cracking a smile. Maybe, we should get married after all? Maybe. Bravo! Mr. Kazimierz Janiak. -Who? -My witness. Hello, beautiful ladies and my dear gentlemen. Well hello, sir! Um, good afternoon. Sort of… Where’s my veil? Mommy, a veil in your case is taking things a bit too far. An innocent flower wreath? Even more so! Maybe. But… Now what? Leopold is not a tall man. A bit on the short side. He’s got a big heart, though. Well… Well, okay. It’s better than nothing. Better than nothing. A very warm welcome to everyone, the bride and groom above all. We have gathered together to unite them in the holy bond of matrimony. As we know, the family is the fundamental social unit and as such it enjoys special protection from the Polish state. A marriage is made when two people jointly declare the same intention. Are you ready to do this? Yes, yes. Yes. Well, if it’s necessary… I haven’t heard your reply? Yes! Yes! So, repeat after me. -You go first, sir. -The man goes first? -That’s sexist. -But please go ahead. In full awareness of the rights and obligations, I am aware of the rights and obligations, that come with starting a new family, I hereby solemnly declare, that I am willing to enter into the bond of matrimony With Katarzyna Zawada. And I swear to do everything in my power to make sure that our marriage is harmonious, happy and long-lasting. Me? Married? That would be the end of the world. Simply the end of the world! This film is dedicated to the enduring memory of three wonderful actors: Katarzyna Łaniewska, Paweł Nowisz and Krzysztof Kiersznowski.
