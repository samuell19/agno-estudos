What is it, mister? Are you Mr. Medhat? No, I'm not! Why are you angry?

Nobody has checked on them, sir Open up the door Come in, sir Wake up, girls! Where do you think you are? In a bedchamber, sweeties? This is a government office Bring me Hend Sleem - Have you put in sugar? - Two pieces, sir Idiot! I've told you a hundred times, one piece Don't be upset.

I only know that his name is Medhat He works in the Education Department at the Mogamma' He's come for some business and I've come to hurry him up What's his business here? He came to relieve himself What do you mean? In proper language we say "to relieve oneself" I'll say it plainly, he's come to go to the toilet The toilet?! You know, the toilets at the Mogamma' are scandalous Mr. Medhat is a man of refinement He likes to go somewhere decent Where else than in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? He used to come here, but since the Arab League was completely renovated, he has been going there There it is, right in front of you - At the Arab League? - Yes All right, thank you very much - You're welcome - What? You're welcome - Peace be with you - And with you You're brothers, aren't you? You are but you don't want to say so Which of you is the other one? She was with us and did exactly as we did She was with us and did exactly as we did She was with us and did exactly as we did Hend They may say what they will, I too will say what I will You should hear me and write down what I say I was arrested in a public place, in the cafeteria of a 5-star hotel, not in an apartment as is written Whom are you trying to fool? I have the right to say what I will It's up to the Prosecution to accept it or not Why do you want to charge me with something I didn't do? What will you profit by that? Your colleague here is very insolent You have seen that yourselves It's not in your favour Her insolence bodes evil for all of you If she comes to her senses, the old statements will all be scrapped and replaced by new ones The Prosecution will review them and set you free It was your fault, mom. You insisted that I marry your niece who marred and tarred my life May God forgive you, because you are my mom As for her, no! May she marry someone who'd make her live torture and torment Listen to me and go ask his pardon, he's an evil man I didn't do anything wrong Let him do what he will, I'll not prostrate myself He's called the barrack's chief of staff They'll detail two guards to take you into detention Please sign the statement. They treat us better at the DA's office than they do here You know that I wasn't working with you Yes, dear, you were Working doesn't necessarily have to be in a bed Sign or you'll be carried out on a stretcher Just try to touch me Mom, burn all of my clothes, no, don't... rather, set them on fire, better still, poison them! If that niece of yours attends my funeral my torment will be double I want you to know the way I've committed suicide It's by falling from high up. The idea came to me from the TV, from the film "Between Heaven and Earth" How I hoped the lift would break down and not take me up But the Mogamma's lift did not break down It's my destiny I've come for Mr. Medhat Mr. Medhat has just arrived. He's taking the lift Thank God Mr. Medhat! - Mr. Medhat! - What is it? Nothing... You're quite right, sir You don't only deserve to come to the Arab League You should go to the UN To be fully at your ease, sir Truly, at first I was wondering... But having seen you, I say you have every right What's the matter exactly? Shall I speak when you're pressed to be relieved? Pressed to be relieved? Yes, of course, I know it Go in, be at ease, and when you come out I'll explain my request and all will be well Go on. I wish you a speedy recovery Which Medhat do you want?

Find me a way to contact those people Let me know what sort of people they are I have an attack plan, sir Any attack will involve victims, General I think we should establish communication Who's there?

What is it? Flee for your life. They have taken over the Mogamma' - Really? - Yes I'm the one that was giving away money in the lift I was going to the top to jump off Death by jumping off the top is sinful but death along with you is all right What death, mister?

Yes, sir But this is a feminine voice, a tender voice I'm the Minister of Interior What? Who? How do I know you're the Minister of Interior? Isn't it possible that you may be somebody else? Is it possible that you don't recognize my voice? How should I recognize your voice? Are you singer Abdel Wahab or Abdel Halim? Have we had mutual dealings that I should recognize your voice? Look, it's the Minister of Interior speaking, and in my capacity I ask you, who are you? Swear to it that you are the Minister of Interior I'm the Minister of Interior and as I'm willing to believe you, you should believe me. Who are you? I have been assigned to speak with you The situation here is horrifying The whole floor is mined with butane gas cylinders They will explode them with the guns they have They warn you and your men, if you make any rash move, they'll burn up the Mogamma' with all those in it Do you know their demands? How many are they? How should I know? They're holding a gun to my head All right, child, tell them the Minister wants to talk with them. To negotiate is best We want the safety of all, terrorists as well as hostages The Minister wants to talk with you personally To talk with me? No, I will not speak on the phone If he wants to talk, let it be through a wireless The telephone would restrict my movements With a wireless I can talk in the midst of people - My motion would be free - OK. Tell them to send the wireless with a child, 4-5 years old Anything else? No What? I cannot endure any more! Calm down, madam, and have patience! Let me go. Excuse me, I'm leaving Where to? I have permission to leave two hours early Yes, I gave her permission Because I'm nursing Nursing? Do you look like a woman that nurses?

The Wireless is on the way They're looking for a child to send it with - Have they agreed? - Yes So far so good Please, please, this is not the right time We have better things to do I promise, as soon as things settle I'll speak to everyone of you individually What? What is it? Walking in the footsteps of the devil ends in perdition That guy is doomed, his end is certain He'll either end in prison or on the rope A beauty like you whom all youths yearn for... What makes you get involved with him? You're not made for prison but for a pleasant life, for perfumes, furs and fancy cars All you need is a long dress and a veil that you may become virtuous Return to your senses Why have you chosen me in particular for your advice? Is that the gaze of someone giving advice? You're like a sister to me and I fear for you And those? Aren't they like kin to you? Aren't they to be feared for? No, those are not fit for advice, they're stubborn I'm like them, as stubborn as they are - One dies only once - I don't want to die! Calm down, madam. It's not up to you! I say, let's assault them! What?! Assault? And risk our lives? Come closer to me Let's attack them as one man. What could happen? A few of us may die, 3 or 4 or 6! But I'm not a man, I'm not a man Calm down! You try it first You attack first, we will follow you I don't know how to attack, I can only plan In Europe and advanced countries the one who plans is the one who attacks - Really? - Really I know What's behind all this whispering If you don't like being here with us you can go down to those important people below But I won't send you down the stairs I'll send you down the window No, I'm happy to be here with you Why don't you go down to them below? I'm quite comfortable here It's the President, sir You mean the Prime Minister? No, sir, it's the President Yes, Mr. President We're fully in control of the situation A bunch of fools, we can finish them off in a minute But, for the safety of the officials in the Mogamma', we are resorting to amicable means No, we don't have adequate information about them, Sir But it's a very trivial operation Rest assured, Sir, rest assured Where's the child? Damn you! This is not your street boss... It's the Minister of Interior High-ups tremble in his presence Fine, fine...

What'“ you say? May your mother be bereaved of you! I want a lion roaring it out May your mother be bereaved of you! - Frown! - Here Here, uncle May your mother be bereaved of you! Bravo! I'll recommend you for playing on TV What's the matter, woman? I'm happy for my son. He deserves all jubilation He faced all terrorists though he's not an officer Bravo, Mahrous!

With the collision method A challenge between greats, the meeting of giants Can you imagine. . Just a second I used to sit and watch Animal World on TV to see how elephants dealt with such matters - Are you an idiot? - No, why? Because the censors cut out those scenes Even between elephants? Even between elephants I'm a coward! I submit my resignation! What's happening up there? A failed attempt by one of the hostages to escape Things have been brought under control. No injuries, out! They have forces enough to blow the Mogamma', even to blow the Pyramids Let them attack. I'm ready for the confrontation Why should we be trodden down in the scramble? We accepted our lot contentedly, patiently! Stop it, you nagger! I'll let them fire on any woman uttering a word Damn you all! You are the source of all trouble! Calm down, brother... - What's your name? - Samir Calm down, Samir. Behave in a civilized manner They're the fairer sex. Be tender with them Tenderness with them is short-lived, What's half an hour in a 24-hour day? Are you the half-an-hour type? No, I'm not speaking about myself Are any of you of the half-an-hour a day type? Leave off this foolery and let's go our way! It's lunch time and we must have some rest Are we not human beings? In Europe and advanced countries they treat people as human beings I want to speak with you for a moment - Me? - Yes The police down there aren't the real danger, these people here are If you control them no one will overpower you Attention! The Minister of Interior is speaking Considering my responsibility for the safety and security of all citizens, I call you to surrender in order to prevent bloodshed It's for the safety of people & yours as well! I'd stress that we shall not succumb to any threats whatever the cost may be! I remind you that not one terrorist operation has been successful in this country neither during the tenure of my predecessors nor mine I repeat, either immediate unconditional surrender or else, you very well know what! What we have just heard calls for an answer Make those people down there understand Gentlemen, we're not playing cops and bandits We have demands that must be met To all soldiers, attention If you want a battle, we are prepared Our answer will reach you promptly O Almighty God! Mr. Minister, calculate the number of cylinders here Estimate their fire power and destructive capacity As I've said, we have demands that must be met May I have an idea about your demands to see if they're legitimate or otherwise? Our demands... yes... Just a moment... Don't you feel hungry? What would you have for lunch? Anything to prop us up Anything? Nonsense! You're respectable people What do you think of kebab and meat fingers with salads? - God is Great - God is Great By God, you're a man of understanding! Order a kilo of kebab for every one Lots of outlets and fewer meat fingers The salads, assorted! In Europe and advanced countries they have "tehina" salad with kebab Our first demand is for kebab and meat fingers - What? - Kebab and meat fingers - What? - Kebab and meat fingers Lots of kebab and fewer meat fingers Salads, green, tehina, aubergine and soft drinks Kebab! They want kebab for lunch How can we get enough for that throng? It's risky to let them have kebab, sir They'd like it up there and stay put Kebab for lunch, escalope for supper, and we remain stuck here day and night Sir, let's blockade them completely I suggest we cutoff the water supply Patience, General, that's not the way to handle it I say we get you Kentucky packages I wash my hands of responsibility The authorities want to get you Kentucky packages - Please, don't budge! - We said kebab! If you give way to the authorities we will end with beans and ta'meya - That'd be a catastrophe! - Don't give way What counts is the public will Express your will yourselves The authorities are down below. The windows are open Kebab, Kebab! Kebab, Kebab! Kebab, kebab! Else we'll turn your life into hell! Kebab, kebab! Else we'll turn your life into hell! Kebab, kebab! Else we'll turn your life into hell! Kebab, kebab! Else we'll turn your life into hell! Kebab, kebab! Else we'll turn your life into hell! Kebab, kebab! Else we'll turn your life into hell! All right, get them kebab Sir, won't you perform the afternoon prayer? The time for the afternoon prayer extends till sunset May God save us before sunset and we'll perform the afternoon prayer and a thanks prayer as well They may put a wrong interpretation on it, sir They'd say the Minister heard the call to prayer but didn't go to pray All right, let's go God's blessings and peace be upon you O God, remove our affliction and save our people Amen O God, guide us among them that You guide aright Make us wholesome among them that You make wholesome O God, condemn us not for what the foolish among us have done Whom does he mean by the foolish? Surely he means the terrorists, sir Yes, that's possible The kebab, salads and all will reach you soon The restaurants are sending their own men to deliver the orders to you Are those the men that will bring us the food? If they come up here they will devour us They look like anti-terrorist guys If we ask for others, they may have another team ready We demand 5-star service, the kebab is to be brought up by Semiramis Hotel waitresses I have a simple plan, while they're busy eating we confuse them by a feint through the fire engine ladder to distract them and then we go in I don't like it I want the incursion to be effected without shedding a single drop of blood The incursion will be effected without bloodshed All right then, we may try Cairo Gove rho rate, Education Department How come that when it's not prayer time you pray and when it is prayer time you don't? The call to prayer is on, why aren't you praying? An attack! An attack! What is it? They're sending troops up the fire engine ladder! Open the water faucet! - What is it? - I don't know Open up! The soldiers are coming up! Truly, an incursion without a drop of blood! Great! Great! Throw the cylinder! Withdraw! Withdraw! - What are you doing? - I'm paying No, it's at the expense of the government - At the government's expense? - Yes Still, we have to pay - Tea, ladies - Thank you My hands are greasy, damn it Do you want a perfume? No, I use Eau de Toilette Lipstick? I don't use lipstick because my man is so often away He's away so often because you don't wear makeup Do it and he will stay beside you all the time No, no, please! - Try, just a little - No, I can't I'm not used to such things There's a limit to patience. Let's get it over with I want to tell you something important This thing will come to an end somehow We have demands that have to be met If you want this affair to end answer our demands We will listen, we will see... And just for the sake of argument My demands... I have no demands I came to get a certificate for my children I wanted to have them moved to a school nearer to home But since matters have come to this our demands too must be high All my life I have been obeying the government The present one, the one before, and the coming one Supposing I didn't obey, what would happen? Nothing. I'd be left to stew in my own juice I commute to and from work crammed in the bus, saying: "Glorified be He Who hath subdued these unto us" Prices are up. so what? I have only a couple of children I obey the government's family planning authority I have only a boy and a girl and thank God they're fine The class is overcrowded with 84 pupils The children come home worn out and dizzy and pale from overcrowding and air pollution in the class still, thank God, they're all right Nothing gives me trouble but obtaining bread I stand in along queue, I suffer while getting it and I suffer while eating it Like the rest of you I'm humble and contented My only demand is for the recognition of my humanity I don't want to be insulted at home, at work, or in the street I think, for such demands I shouldn't be penalized or reprimanded or blamed But since matters have come to a head-throat stage come on, demand what you will, I'm at your service Come on, state your demands We're in a strong position Those people below may respond to our demands Come on, madam, what is your demand? Speak, don't be afraid What do you want? Ask for an aeroplane, each of us to get five or six million dollars and go wherever one wants Do you think yourself Rambo? What's wrong with this country? Think of something else Please, will you do me a favour? - What do you want? - I take very costly medicine Three hundred pounds a packet, and it isn't readily available I had to sell my possessions How many packets do you need? What medicine is it? Here's the prescription They're crazy, sir, taking over the Mogamma' to get some medicine! Get the medicine, General We're destined to be burdened by the shortcomings of the other ministries I can't believe I should risk capital punishment and get nothing for it but a packet of medicine Let's demand something big. My life isn't that worthless I support a wife, two kids and a widowed sister Tell the Minister to order all police stations to jail any wife complaining against her husband Any wife doing that must be ill-bred! Are you an imbecile? You want me to ask the Minister to forbid wives complaining against their husbands? This is an opportunity to ask for big things In execution they will dwindle to little things If we start by demanding little things we'll get nothing State your demands! What is it? Do you lack nothing at all? Do we have milk and honey for breakfast and TV recipes for lunch? Speak up! Why are you silent? You, why are you silent? Keeping a gun in your pocket, what for? Why did you stand by my side? I stood by your side to hasten my own end I have a death sentence hanging on my head Someone of the connected people robbed me, robbed me off my land while I was away... in the army When I returned I tried to get my own back by law Sixteen years spent in the law courts to no avail From judge to judge, from court to court and never a decision was handed down And when I lost patience and things got out of hand I was sentenced in 3 months In sixteen years I couldn't get my rights, and in ninety days I was sentenced to death In meting out imprisonment or death, courts are agile, and so heavyhanded when returning a citizen's rights Then justice is what we require That's what we should demand, justice What do you demand? Why have you volunteered with us? I'm too shy to say Do you feel embarrassed like the rest of us? Yes, I do While you get over your shyness, let's see what our friend Helal demands Do you also want an aeroplane to fly abroad? No, I only want to go to my home village What's so good about your home village? There I wouldn't be insulted as I have been here I'd live among my folks whom I love and who love me I'd plant my land which has become a waste land You're here in the service of the Motherland I'm not in the service of the Motherland I'm in the service of his excellency the general, and of the lady and of the children of his excellency You are right, Helal, the Motherland is not one man nor a thousand using you for their own purposes Mr. Minister What? What do you say? You asked for kebab, we said, all right But to get carried away by your vanity to the extent of dictating state policy, no, no! I swear I'd blow the Mogamma' with all in it! Wise up! What you said, Helal, has angered those people greatly It seems they don't want you to plant your land They'd rather have you stand at ceremonies the whole day through under the scorching sun About turn Dismissed I'm not an immoral woman. I'm for show only My job is merely to sit with the other girls The customers see me and decide the goods are superb They get drunk and can no longer tell the difference I slip by, get my fee, and no one can catch me That's my profession. I know no other I tell the officer that's what I was doing and I'm prepared to say so before Prosecution and Court He says, "No, you sleep with men" I say, "No, I only keep them company" He says, "No, you sleep with them" That's coercion. No one should coerce another No one is entitled to do that whoever he may be The Ministry of Interior has announced that an unfortunate incident has occurred at the Mogamma' A madman is withholding a certain number of hostages It's believed he has some aid in his reckless deed To ensure the safety of hostages and other citizens Security is dealing with the madman prudently So far there has been no loss of life and no damage Mr. Minister, why so? We were proceeding well! Anyhow, you have declared me a madman, accordingly, I shall behave as a madman I have one demand which I shall by no means retract The first item in the midnight news bulletin should announce the resignation of the cabinet - What? - Resignation of the cabinet A government that tells lies must resign If this demand is not met you'll have corpses raining out of the windows Are you serious? No one asks that of a madman! I'm a madman by the testimony of the government! Resignation of the cabinet! They'll never do that! The Great Pyramid would sooner be a heap of dust! This way you're committing suicide And you're taking us with you to slaughter In Europe and advanced countries the cabinet wouldn't resign I said from the very start that you're insane! We'll now see whether I or the government is insane It's regrettable that we should meet under such circumstances Such incidents take place all over the world Some ending without harm, and some ending with calamities, God protect us! We pray to God that all may end well The government has to deal with matters with strictness When a puny fellow tries to make the cabinet resign just because he's holding a few hostages, what of our honour, of the prestige of the State? What's amazing is that he wants the cabinet to resign just because we described him as a madman The Ministry of Interior has always practised self-control but unfortunately other channels prefer propaganda We're the first to get a dose of that propaganda What of legitimacy and respect for the Constitution? Nothing can make the cabinet resign but a vote of no confidence and that will never be because the Assembly is all ours I think we should make a pretence of resigning And when things settle down all goes back to normal You mean we should announce the resignation then deny it? No! That would be a blot on our Information Service We'll say that the announcer made a mistake If we meet that terrorist demand then we'd daily have a similar demand on our hands No cabinet will then last more than a month Or does the Minister of Interior think differently? What I think you'll see translated into action We're men of deeds not words Latest: The Ministry of Interior has announced that the unfortunate incident at the Mogamma' has ended ten minutes ago when the Special Forces took over the situation and released the hostages The Ministry will issue a detailed statement once the investigations are completed All in order, sir Take your positions and be ready for the assault Listen all of you up there! Whether you're one or five or ten or a thousand! He who may impose anything on the Government has not been born yet! We have been overpatient with you But there's a limit to patience We account your hostages as righteous martyrs sacrificing their lives for the Country! The government will pay them generous compensations As for you... As for you... As for you, you know What's coming to you! I need not explain Work at the Mogamma' begins at 8.00 am. By 8.00 am. everything will be normal Employees will be at their desks If you don't release the hostages and surrender by 6.00 am, you'll be wiped out in 15 minutes! The government has no arm to be twisted He who doesn't like this can go to the Assembly He who doesn't like that can go to hell! He who acts the way you are doing is committing suicide. That's all I have to say! It's over! Take all of them inside and let no one move Move to the corridor! Move! Take rest. There's ample time before dawn How can I have rest, General, with all of this happening? What losses would you expect if we made the assault? That doesn't matter, sir What's important is that the operation should succeed regardless of who dies The government will pay you good money after you die! Your heirs will become rich. See how I've benefited you? You may be worthless in the eyes of the government but you are very precious to me I don't want you to be upset with me I don't think I have crossed any of you Go your way. You are free Wait! Hold your fire! Were you among the hostages? What? Were you among the hostages? Yes, I was among the hostages Did you see the crazy terrorist? - Who? - The crazy terrorist Yes, I saw the crazy terrorist How did he look? Can you give us a description? Well, he was neither very tall nor very short Neither very bulky nor very lean Neither very dark nor very fair He was like any one of us What were you doing at the Mogamma'? I had some affair to see to and it was settled, thank God We have found no terrorists in the Mogamma', sir Only a shoe-shine man and a service soldier Subtitled by : ANIS EBEID Cairo , Egypt
