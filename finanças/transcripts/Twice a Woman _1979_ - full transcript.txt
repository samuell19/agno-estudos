Something's not right. So you are not a lesbian. The use of that word, then don't. I'm in love with a girl. You've nothing to be ashamed of either. During the course of our marriage, I was nicely worn in. And after that, I spent five years in accordance with your rules of life. I haven't done a thing, not for a wife. As for my ex, suddenly, the watch turns out to be, and that to me is not indifferent. If you are afraid that people will think about it... ...that I have you enough I have been with men. However, you have now two children are produced. If you feminine logic starts to go away. If you and your friends have to say... ...after you, no man of mine can be fulfilled. It is never at a loss for an explanation. Start! and your the father. Let him in your everyday life. Is it because you don't have kids you can have? Now that all of the rigid picky with each other.

He is crazy about them. I'll be there in a store? And, ms. Tinberg, then? We are going to eat them now. I put water on it. You had to get away. Or rather it. Tea, it doesn't matter. And why is it here? Thomas couldn't look. However, ms. Tinberg was it to hang up. Why is that? He was not good. Now, he has something else to buy. Mrs. Nithart, I have to tell you a little bit. I did not have a son. I will never have one. I am, However. I am in love with your daughter, and she loves me. We are sleeping with each other, and they are very happy. I don't Know how to be. A lot of people think it's disgusting, and against nature. We are against nature.. We have to put water on for tea. food moorheads, without having to go hungry... ...say, what we don't want to say it. Mrs. Nithart, I ask you to take the hand of your daughter in marriage. We want to stay together. And, you know, We are so happy that We finally got to rest for that one. Up until now, she always... - go on, mom. I want to know what it's about you hearing it. So, she had always been. About her not talking. Documents. Well, modest. Thomas said he would be home? Maybe my mother has just seen. It will, however, let it be. In a meeting of his sub-department. A professor who has no classes and more, want to give, or something like that. Exactly, I follow it doesn't. Thomas was up against him I thought? And I thought, right in front of him. He has studied, in any case, not much at all. What he is studying? Andrology. You're not the only one who doesn't Know what it is. I think no one Knows it. And he Knows it. And is there a future in it? This will be my husband, ask me. Today, there are a lot of students. However, he can still be a mechanic to be. With his Harley-Davidson motorcycle. As a driving force. Such a great one. Are you happy with it? It, of course. Otherwise, I was not here. I am glad that you are, it's so nice to have. I must be off. Do you have a picture of him. Yes, of course.

Looks like you are. In the eyes of my ex-husband. You can see his pants don't. I 'm taken. Now, you can hold me for a fool. They will never have the material to do so. Can I bring my husband? Of course it is. Thank you for your hospitality. Nice to meet you. Day, Sylvia. Give Thomas a kiss from me. It was a dream. Did you get that photo of already have an idea of when we will be in the Artis zoo of them. So, what do you think? Cunning. We are at a time in Nice and look after her? That will be tomorrow as well. What should I do? I have a nice impression to make. You just have to not go. I'd rather be alone. However, we are still together? I can't take with you. Why did I have to on the way to France. My mother is a very old one. The two of us, that they would not be able to understand it. Just like your mother... It is not known what will come up? Not that I was an assistant to ben or something like that. We can think of nothing at all. I don't do more to help them out. You are not my mother... Are you ashamed for me. No, no. You Know it is the best. But you will probably have to understand. How do you come up with? Your mother should not know about it. And that's not even getting old. They pissed me off. That is, it is going to get worse. You are a mother, it is not at all stupid. You'd best be able to explain it. However, you have to be my mother, but to the fool. It's forced to me, which is a comedy on the run. I have quick question for you just don't do it. And that's why you have to be bad for you. I learned a lot that I've taken. Did you get it so I can be miserable and would feel like. There's pleasure of it, bitch. You'll make me cry. I didn't know that it was you, as much as could care less.

What's your favorite drink? - Picasso a retrospective., - Two of Pernod. Where do you come from? From A Small Country. - Where is it? - Far, far away. As soon as I saw you, I felt... ...that this meeting was pre-destined. - Are you serious? , Really well. It's just like you, I have known for years. Do you feel that's not even a little bit? Maybe a little bit? Maybe a little more. Something like this will never be one-sided. It fits hand-in-glove, it will fit that well on the wrist. That's something to be aware of. I am really not opposed to any woman. I have to say something else. You have to believe me. You have to give me a bit of confidence. Yes... confidence... I know you want it to. You're not at me, but by someone in the past. Put it away from you. I was only asking what to trust. The Pernod is good? Yes, that's right. We are going to dance at the start of the Swing Mediterranean sea. They have to be. - Do you want to dance? Not yet. I really don't like women who instantly want to dance to it. There is always something wrong with it. Ah, come on. Let me warn you. I've had more experience with women than you do. We will have to go away? It's just too much, don't you think? I want to be somewhere quiet to talk to you. In my hotel room. I will not stop rape. We don't have to go with the other to go to bed. That happens once in a while. Are you saying that we have no right to have a good night's sleep? Now, We. Join us on a journey. Don't you want to dance with me? Come on, let's go. Would you like to enter?

I've never heard of. Still not married? No matter how old? What does that really matter. I would have to 'm in love, even if it was 20 or 60. Now, it's about you. What is your profession? Don't be alarmed. The AI was in it, I know a lot of... supervisor or the so... I'm a 41. Now, I know what I'm doing. I am happy with the Alfred's. He was late to see him. Why is he not with you? Your Thomas. How is his family? Please... How do you feel? Is your leg better? I've had a lot of pain. I could barely walk. Sometimes, it is very quiet and you are all by yourself. It's fine now, everything is in bloom. The trees are greener than in the us. Do you know that guy? It happens to be. You were in Nice? What are you doing here? And this is Sylvia. We Nithart. The girl next door, your daughter. She has told you. Your husband was a professor, and his books are still being sold. I would love to read it. I would be in the world. Just go away. Keep me on the go. I told him that I am happy. Well. Please go and took a ham to the robot. Your wife took the ham, the Cow will go. I listen to it. Maybe it was because I said something about your father. Come along with me. Alfred, it is too late. That guy? I can't give you Research, not give up. You need to find, you can find her yourself. I can't give you Research, not give up. You need to find, you can find her yourself. They are in the world. These days. - Is this his wife? Yes, Mom. Now, he says: Get a coca cola with a straw. Cola drinks are one of the many critics. What he writes now? He said: In the ancient Greek tragedy,... there are always two truths to one another. The divine and the human.' He said Thank you. No, no. 'Just shut up.' Now, he's going to tell her where We are sitting. And he says: it don't Look right. Now they discover. She looked around... up in the air... ...and from the judge's balcony, wandering of her gaze happened to us. It's going to start. How do you do it? I don't Know, good I think. And what about you? Did it make you think of us? - Which one of us is in the underworld? So there you are, Alfred. And this is Sylvia. Are you guys taking this on. I tell you now? That kind of music. Alfred, I'm constantly on my wine Waiting for us. Hello, Laura. Hello, Mom. Just imagine: As. This is the Mom. I take advantage of this wine. What do you think of her? I will be here for the entire night. That is, we see, we won't be back. How are things going with you? You see, there are very good. Is your hair in a different way? It will be better taken care of. A new colorist. He said he wanted to tell me what I should write. How do you do it? - Do I have to tell you? A women's opinion, it is essential to such a document. And what about you? - My question is to you is never what it was. I really don't Know. Eric had just as good of Orpheus, a woman is able to make it... ...as Research about the man. That's not the point. Eric is a director and writer. He has been inspired by the ancient... when the women, always the men were to be seen. True love, at that time, it was the love between the men. The women were just incubators. But with that theory, do you have any play. Once I write a book about the influence of the classics on the scene right now. Your father had to have known how something like that should handle it. I don't agree with you. I thought it was wonderful. It's not a tragedy. Here are two truths that are opposite of each other... ...of the divine and the human. The hero will always fight against it. Orpheus is ripped apart, Oedipus pulls his eyes out... As the director, my only Shot. He looks like the retarded son. Does he have a girlfriend? It's not a gay man? You're obviously the only one that he has not had before. Why is this a bad document? That will be more and more people are wondering. Where do you want to go with your side of the story is about a tragedy? There are both men and women. In a piece with only men or only women,... ...you will not get a true tragedy. At best, melodramatic far - way that you can produce a... that is, this evening. Great. What about a time ago. If you go back to Alfred's? - To save me. So how did he have it? I may just be writing down whatever he thinks. And what about you? Tonight, only compliments. - The immortal piece of art. You have a good taste. Who is she? A friend of mine. - Ask me for it. I mull about. I'm going to take you to the balcony. - Do I need to bring? Typically. The critic may, with the girl at the balcony. ...the author is eating in the kitchen with the staff. Success. Up until about ten years of age. Say hello to Karin. She has to go home. The car has? I don't know. If you want to continue? We'll let it go. Not even to dance, as in Nice? Were you in Nice? How did it go with your mom? I've got up to greet is being transmitted. Is there something up with it. - They have it is... - nice To meet you. They are getting old. - Nice to meet you. Why did you get divorced? He has a kind of restlessness, which, in the end I couldn't bear it. And we didn't have children. Who was that? To me. If you wanted to visit them. I wanted to be nothing prefer it. I've had it done, but there is something very wrong here. What a pain. Each monthly period will be... ...by a man who, necessarily, have children. It Is motherhood, so important to a woman? No, but if you do, you will always be a daughter, and felt... ...you'll only have your mom come down... ...by the mother-to-be. I think, like you, do not have children, but if you wanted to visit your mother's face. When I was a kid it had been, I would have certainly loved. And if it's changed to? You'd have to be the child of another. Then, I couldn't have made that a child will be held. A man Knows, can never be completely sure whether or not it is his child. They are going to believe. They're at our mercy. Take a look at their nipples. Have something like this soul igs, have We not in our bodies. Does he have children? - Alfred? I don't know. I think it is. A marriage without children is difficult. A child binds you to each other. You will make less of a hassle. Without a child, everything is a lot brighter. You will need to go. As in the us. You never have your mother come down? Would you like to know that I have a child, you see? We can have a child to adopt. Would you have a child with me has to offer. It, of course. But, that's not right. When I was 14, I am the sea, the run-in... at night. I'm not any more. My father told it to me. I was all dressed up... ...and I ran straight into the embankment off the road. Always straight ahead until I got close it went off. I was able to go swimming, but I didn't do it. Beachcombers have saved me, give artificial respiration was applied. Why did you do that? - I don't know. Why do you tell me? - I don't know. Are you crying about? The wood is coated with seven layers of chalk, on canvas. The gold is applied to... ...and start painting with the darker colors... ...and then the lighter ones. The gold is applied with a garlic extract. There Is something rather than nothing? That I brought them out of Italy. Don't use it. That is, the monks of mount Athos. There should be no women. Even a female animal. No milk for the monks. Don't you feel good? They will look fabulous. It is his day. Beautiful, all of gold. Our show-piece. The archangel, Michael. In a small country, we lived right next to the sea. From my window, I saw a straight line. Like the horizon that is 20 feet away and stood. And that crosswind in your face. Something like this doesn't exist there. As a child, I thought of you: I want to be later in places where there is no wind... ...and where there are no straight lines. Do you think that's crazy? You have me removed. That's not why I love you, but without you, I was just sitting there. I love you so much. I've never been against someone who is said to be. I will always love you. Also, if we have an argument, and you are a terrible things to say... ...this has nothing to do with that, I love you. Would you like a cup of tea from the new samovar? And yes, I do. We Nithart, a friend of mine. So when I saw this one... ...I thought that it was a living icon. Ms. Tinberg? A telegram from France. I will have to read it out? Consignor: la Maison du Roi-Albert, the city. The 22nd of August. Your mother's death, this evening eight o'clock. Expect that you will have the funeral of your choice. With our participation. Do you want it to repeat? No, no, thank you. A copy is given to you tonight on the bus. Do you want to have a few days for the cat to be put in place? I have started to drive away. Thank you very much. Laura Tinberg. As you can see, there are no coincidences. Go and sit down. Where are you going? Nice. - In August? You are a fool. It came out that way. - I'm on my way to the house. I'm in an Italian mountain village of sitting down to write. Your ex-husband called it my piece as a melodramatic dragon. But for all that, as a reviewer, you can think of... ...I have a hundred times thought. However, I will do it. You put it on. - Does he own pieces of writing. Alfred has already broken, have been criticized for it, he will start. I've got a lot written, but have no idea what it was. At home, I will have to look critically at. If your vacation starts, you're like the guy who is a turd, eat... the hope is that it will bread out. You have to have your hair cut. Nice. That is a girl you will get your food and when you did, because I often think about. As you all know... well, You see, who you are is not a lot of attention. But later on it will be there time and time again, think again. not only for the face. - What is it? She's standing behind you... ...and then explained to her the hand on your shoulder... ...and then she looked at me, and... Will it work? It's going to be. Do you do this often? The work was done. This night I did not sleep for the entire day of riding. What do you mean, nothing? If such a thing is on the way to happen, you have to have. I'll take a room in a hotel and you go to sleep at night. You are a wise woman to separate from a critic. Promise you ought not to go away. To get rid of me with a loud bang. - A promise. Have you been to the family. For me, it has never been dusted off. It's unhealthy, all that will matter. You will be allergic of. Is that the case? And why do all of the above? For example, I can never find it again. I think that you might be surprised... have you a critique. Also, it is never a good thing. So, I mean, it's not. Most of you are here? Why are you looking for no job? For half a day or so? As a stylist, would you? There are also other jobs. I know some people who have to do something that is fun to be able to help you. You do Know that I would much rather have kept. A negative remark. I would like to talk to you. - Does not make sense. , But I don't have. You are doing the whole Week off. If you give me one. You may want to have a few days off? Go to your house? - When & where? - For now. For how long? I have no idea. Give me a call at the end of the Week. Not to be forgotten. Please call Friday night at dinner time. - Is promised? Yes. Dear mom, I've always wanted to write... after that horrible scene at the Nice...' When is the next show on the 23-hour, 21-minute...

I'm looking forward to, However. My wife thought it was very good. That for me is a joy to use. I am Sorry that you are so early on to have disturbed you. That doesn't matter. He thinks that I am Thomas, do. Otherwise, he himself was to come. It's so old-fashioned. I can understand that. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry about that. Hi there.
