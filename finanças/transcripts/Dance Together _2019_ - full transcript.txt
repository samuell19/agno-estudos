Oh I love that color on you. Thanks. I got it from this cute boutique in Paris. La Fleur Rose. You guys probably haven't heard of it. Haven't heard of it? That's where everyone who's anyone from LA shops while they're in Paris. I don't know. I think it kind of washes you out. ♪ ♪ Go Holly! Go Holly! Go Holly! Go Holly! ♪ ♪ Hey! What's going on? Everybody, get to class! Move it! Good morning students. This is your student council president Kelly here. There is a food drive being held in the front foyer. Please bring down all non-perishable items at lunch. I'm handing the mic over to Linda with sports. Hey, hey. Tonight at the west field the boys' soccer team is... So, did you see Stan's video that he posted last night? Yes. And it hurt my eyes. Are you kidding? It was good. Come on. It was good. It was cute. No. It wasn't cute. I liked the music. Ah! I am so sorry. Watch where you're going, weirdo! What are you still doing here? I am so sorry about that. Zoey. You were a little harsh back there. He bumped into me. I can't believe our first dance comp is only a month away. My solos isn't even done yet. And I love your costume for it. Almost as much as you love our jazz costume? What was Ms. Mindy thinking? I don't know. Honestly Tiffany, I think that you should start designing our costumes. Yeah, you'd be great at that. You guys really think so? Totally. What? Okay fine. You guys are never going to guess who asked me out! - What? - Who? Brian. Get out! Dead serious! I heard from Tyler that he was dating Amber, but apparently Amber was just spreading that to get back at Zack. But Cynthia told me that she's with Zack, so he's completely over her and Brian is back on the market! Well not for long, if this date goes well. We're going to the movies. Wow, another movie date huh? So, what movie are you guys seeing? Oh, ah, that new super hero movie! I forget what it's called, but I know he'll love it. Awesome idea! Okay, what are you going to wear? I'm styling you for it, of course. This is perfect timing to bring out my cape. What? Is that weird? Yes! That's weird. Five, six, seven, eight. And switch. And flex, and point. And flex, and point. Very nice. And move to lunge. Good morning. And hold. Straight legs up. Zoey you can stand right here. But five steps back. Holly, can you go to center? Okay. Let's take it from the top. ♪ Great job today ladies. I'll see you all tomorrow. I'm going to pop out for a second. Holly go over you solo. We'll run it when I get back, okay? You okay? Yeah I'm fine. Okay. Bye. Okay Holly. Let's go. Okay. So then you're going to run, run, side jeté. What was that? I can't really do the jumps full out because of my knee. Well what are you going to do at competition? Huh? You have to do it now like you're going to do it on stage. Okay? Okay. Then we're going to side roll, side roll, pas de bourrée and walk. Yep, like that. There you go. Is it still acting up? I don't know what's going on with it. It's been killing me all practice. Well did you do the jumps full out? You know better Holly. I can't disappoint everyone. Okay, well, it's a good thing we're seeing the sports specialist tomorrow morning because then we can get Dr. Andrews to clear a few things up for us. Holly. Holly. Holly! We're here. The MRI shows that you have an irreparable torn meniscus disk. What does that mean? It looks like you won't be able to dance anymore. ♪ Where were you tonight?! Hey are you ok? What's going on? Um, why did you bail on us? Hey. Hey. Holly. Come on. Come on. Everything is going to be okay Holly. How do you know that? I just... I just know. What does that even mean? You know. Everything will work out. It's... Okay calm down Holly. It's fine. Okay. It's fine. Yeah it's... Stop it. Stop. Holly come on. It's fine. Just calm down, please. Leave me alone, okay. It's fine. Listen. You can do other things, right? Dance isn't everything. Dance is everything. Don't you get that? Dance is everything for me. Okay. Holly! We heard about what happened. You did? The whole school has. That sucks, but maybe you could still come to the comp with us... Uh, anyway. We have a rehearsal at lunch today, so we got to go. Oh okay. Um... Sorry. Dancers only. Hey, do you mind if I sit here? Okay. You're not even going to notice I'm here. Look, there's nowhere else to sit. I'm Alex. What are you doing with your hand? It's my name in sign. I'm deaf. And how do you understand what I'm saying? I can read your lips, so as long as you're facing me I can understand you. That's so cool. If you don't mind me asking, how did you learn how to speak? Um... I learned through the vibrations of other people talking. What do you mean? Put your hand under your chin, like this. Say popcorn. Popcorn? Now say thank you. Thank you. Popcorn. Thank you. See? Yeah. Holly. Alex. Shhhh! Are you going to class? Oh. Did the bell ring? Yeah. It's official. She's out. I mean she wasn't even that good of a dancer in the first place. Yeah. And what was she wearing this morning? She's really let herself go. I heard she had to eat her lunch in the library. Ew. It must suck to be her. Five, six, seven, eight. Five, six, seven eight. What's going on? I thought we started at 4? What are you doing in my spot? I just thought... You thought wrong. I'm glad you guys came in earlier. We have a lot of work to do. Holly, I thought your mom said... No, I'm fine. Yeah. It's all good now. Okay. Good! This team needs you. Let's get to work. Holly. What are you still doing here? Um...

You know how serious your knee injury is. You had me worried sick! Do you want to stay home from school tomorrow? Mhhm. I thought so. I'd like to thank our very gifted artist for drawing a picture of me with a happy face. "Mr. F"? Noah? Well the F stands for fun. Because math is three, two, fun. Let's get back to the lesson. Linear equations, blue line... Okay. Class dismissed. I encourage you all to study for this test. Thank you. Mr. Fisher. I was just wondering what you were saying about this formula. Could you explain it for me again? Alex, you need to pay attention. I already went through this in class. Sorry. I couldn't really understand what you were saying because I couldn't see your face. Are you questioning my teaching methods? No, not at all. I'm just trying to find a way to make this work. Alex, we both know you don't belong at this school, due to your... You should go to a different school. Where they have more time to waste. Oh hey, sweetie. Can you pass me that lamp there? Thank you. I'm telling you, this place is going to be perfect when it's fixed. Hey dad. Can you sign this for me? Yeah, sure. What's it for? Nothing. You're failing math? But you're so good at it. I don't know dad. I've been trying really hard, but Mr. Fisher is still turning his back to me. Do I need to call him again? No. He doesn't get it! I've talked to him, you've talked to him. And he is obviously not interested. Maybe he's right. Maybe I should just switch to a school for the deaf where teachers will actually care about me? No. I don't think you should need to... Don't be ridiculous. You don't need special school. And people shouldn't treat you any differently just because you're deaf. Yeah I know. And you can't let one difficult situation or person define the rest of your life. Thanks Grandma. But I need to pass this class. I know, sweetie. I'll see what I can do. Woah, woah, woah! Not again. Sorry! Hey, aren't you in my math class? Uhh, yeah. Yeah. That class blows! Tell me about it! I'm failing. I mean, I could help you out sometime? Ummm, sure. Okay. I'll see you in class. Girl! Why are you blushing? What? I'm not. Yes you are! And he totally checked you out. What, no! Yeah he did. Did he actually? Yeah. Hey. Hey. Hey. I'm Noah by the way. Alex. Was that sign? Class, today we will be starting our new unit. Trigonometry. So, over here we got a whole bunch of stuff. We got the word hypotenuse which comes from the Latin hypo which means a large and... Hey. Can you understand what he's saying? Want me to ask him to face us? He won't. Is there something you'd like to share with the entire class? Back to the lesson? Thank you. Why wouldn't he? Okay! That's it! Noah! Back to your normal spot. Come on, come on, come on! What do you think you're doing? Not so nice having someone's back to you. Is it? Okay. Fine. Detention! Wait, Mr. Fisher! It wasn't his fault! I should have known you would be involved in this. You can both explain this to the vice-principal. Take your things with you. Now! What are you laughing about? Seriously, what? Nothing, it's just... It feels like you've never been sent to the principal's office before? No. Don't worry. Mr. Fisher has no idea what he's talking about and all the teachers know it. Plus, Ms. Jackson is super sweet. Okay. Oh! Alex, how did I know you were going to be in this! Back to the lesson! You're kidding me? No ma'am. Well Alex why didn't you come to me sooner about this issue? I don't know. After talking to Mr. Fisher, I just gave up, you know? I mean my other teachers are great. They always do their best to help me. But for some reason he has a weird problem with me. I see. Well there isn't a lot I can do about Mr. Fisher's teaching, but we can look into other options. Like moving me to a school for the deaf? Of course not. I'll have a chat with our resource teachers and get back to you as soon as I can. And for now... There's only a half hour left of this period. You guys don't have to go back to class. Thank you so much! So, you can speak sign language? Yep. I'm fluent. That's so cool. Can you teach me some? I guess I can try. So, what all do you want to know? Ummm, how do you say Noah? You have to spell it out like this. Whoa, whoa! Slow down! Slow down! N... O... A... H. Okay, I think I got it. So, how do you say your name? Like this. How come you don't have to spell yours out? It's my sign name my friends gave me. If you hang around me long enough, I can give you yours. Sounds good. So, umm... How do you tell a girl she's beautiful in sign language? Hey! Why'd you guys leave so early? Okay, you'll never guess what happened in math today! Hold that thought. I really need a coffee. Hey, Holly. I see you're hanging out by yourself now? Actually I'm here with Noah and Alex. You know that they're doing sign language, right? Obviously, Holly. You always under estimate me. - Your order. - Thank you. Well, I guess I'll see you at dance tonight... Ooh, actually, I won't. Well... We all miss you. So... I'm at the front of the pyramid for Jazz now. Congratulations. Really? Sorry, did you say something? No. Hey! Where are you going? Sit down and eat your food. I need to see your homework before you leave the table anyway. May I be excused? I have to get my homework. Clear the table first. Go for Paul. No, yeah, yeah. Now's a great time to talk. Are you kidding me? You're definitely not going to get a scholarship with these marks. Mom, I'm trying. Zoey, I'm on the phone! Go upstairs and get ready for dance. I don't want to hear any more out of you today. Wow! You're a dancer. Was. So what happened? Look, I don't really want to talk about it, okay? Okay? But look at this place. It's obviously something you love. So, when did you lose your hearing? Oh, I was born deaf so it's all I know. So you haven't heard music before? Not the way you hear music. What do you mean? It's like the hand thing but with my whole body. So you listen to music through your body? I guess we're not so different after all. By the way, thanks for inviting me over. Oh it's no problem. ♪ I'm so happy that everything's going to work out with you and your mean, small minded, math teacher. Yeah, Ms. Jackson is awesome. Which is nice since some people get angry with me for being born like this. That must really suck. Yeah, well it must suck not being able to dance. Yeah, dance was everything. It was who I was. When my dad died it was my only outlet and now what? I don't know. I have this really cool place that I think you'd like. What is it? It's a surprise! No, you can't do that! You have to tell me, I hate surprises. Oh my gosh! Do you see that? I wish for pizza! With pepperoni. And extra cheese. I just wish everything would go back to normal. Seriously though. Where are we going? You'll see. Trust me on this. Hey guys! This is my friend Holly! She used to be a dancer so she'll fit right in. Hi Holly. I'm Ms. Tanner. Nice to meet you. We've heard so much about you. This is Toby. This is Stella. And this is Riley. He's a little bit shy. Welcome. I'm confused. Why am I here? Watch this. That's all we have so far! What'd you think? Wow. We don't have a group name yet. It's deaf poetry, kind of like music but with the body. It brought us all together. Just like dance. Oh, it's definitely different. Alex mentioned that you might like to join our group? Ahh... We have Regionals in a month so we'll have to teach it to you quick, but from what I hear you'll catch on! And we practice every Tuesday! You can help us with choreography and stuff. Holly, what's going on? Nothing. What? You're too good for us? We're not 'normal' enough for you? No. It isn't that at all. Then what is it? Look, it was really nice of you to bring me here, but no matter what, nothing can replace dance for me. It doesn't have to replace dance. Then what was the point of all this? I just thought you might bring something special to our performance. Look, that's really nice, but this isn't for me. You know my grandma says "Sometimes you have to help someone else in order to help yourself." So what are you saying? I should just move on and completely forget about dance? No of course not. I'm just saying you may need to let go of what you were to find out who you really are. I don't think I can do that. I believe you can do anything. Look at me, I'm deaf and I'm awesome. Come here. Come on. Let's go home. Sure. Alex, you'll never guess what I found! What is this? I wanted to help you the way you helped me. I'm confused? It's called a cochlear implant. It's where you... I know what it is. Why are you showing it to me? Isn't it cool? You'll be hearing in no time. Are you telling me I should become hearing? Um... who doesn't? It's not like you'd want to stay like this for the rest of your life. Stay like this? Are you saying being deaf is a bad thing? No. I just thought you would want to get it fixed. I'm not broken. I don't need 'fixing'. I like the way I am. So what happened between you two? I may have suggested that she should get a cochlear implant? Why? It's a sensitive topic. I know. I messed up. Okay. Yeah you did. You can't just force something like that on a person. I didn't mean to offend her. I just don't understand, like you have a hearing aid right? So then, why doesn't Alex want that? Not everyone wants the same thing. You have to respect her decision. I come from a deaf family. So getting hearing aids was natural. Alex comes from a hearing family who doesn't support cochlear. Everyone has their own perspective. You can't go around trying to change them. I never thought about it that way. Look. I have a plan. And I guess you need my help. Before that can happen, you have to understand where we're coming from. What's the plan? Okay. So I was thinking that... So, are you ready to talk about it? Did you know I had to spend my lunch in the bathroom? It was embarrassing. Hey. Come here. Come here. Okay. The thing is, I thought she would be different than all of the mean kids, but she's just the same. No one at that school will understand me. Hey! From what I heard, she was just trying to help. She just made an honest mistake. I don't know. I just don't understand why. I mean, I'm just like everyone else. It's only that I can't hear. Maybe I should just get the stupid cochlear implant. Hey, hey. You, listen to me. I don't want you trying to feel like you need to change just to please other people. Okay? You're not other people. You're Alex. And what makes you different is also what makes you very very special. You really think so? No. I know so. Come here. Come here. Dad, why are we here? It's not even Tuesday? You'll see. I'm sorry. Hey. All right? Okay. Almost there. There you go. To the left. To the left. Everyone take a seat. To the left. Around. Here we go. Did you like it? I loved it. Even the part about the duck? Was it really that bad? Yeah, it was pretty bad. But with a little bit of practice, I think you could nail it. So what are you saying? I can join the group? Hmmm, I don't know, I mean... I don't think you'll pick up on the choreography fast enough. You're right! I think we need to find someone with a background in dance. Holly, you're in. Yay! Group hug! Come on! Do you see her outfit right now? Yeah. Who wears grey? It's like a vomit grey. She's so washed out. Somebody should really tell her. I know, right? So tragic. Ew. So what are we doing about costumes for Regionals? We usually wear whatever. Okay. This year we should change that. I could get the girl who does my solo costumes to work on costumes for everyone. I don't know. Maybe something a little simpler. Yeah, you're right. We could always wear all black, or all white? Something like that? That might work! Let's bring it up at our next practice and see what everyone thinks. Yeah, that's good. Speaking of practice. - Okay, ready? - Yeah. Shhh! Pythagoras had a theory. But he also liked the letter M. So he called it a theorem. Great! Another interruption. Vice Principal Jackson! Welcome. To what do we owe the honor? Class, I would like to introduce to you Mrs. Paxton. My name is Anne. You can call me Anne. She is our schools very first ASL interpreter! If any of you would like to learn sign ASL you can come meet me anytime. All right Mr. Fisher. That is all for now. You can continue with your lesson. As I was saying. So pretend this is the house. Always... We're always solving for C to get the angle. Remember C is what we want to find for the angle. So we get A squared plus B squared equals C squared. That goes with each and everyone of these examples, everybody. Okay. Class it's time for a pop quiz on this lesson. Here we go. Okay... Begin. ♪ Okay. Some of you did well. Some of you did not so well. Alex, I guess I was wrong about you. Thank you. You did it all by yourself. Good job today, Alex. Guess who just aced her math quiz? Nooo! Yay! So smart! Wooo! Thank you! Wow. You certainly have gotten fat since you quit dancing. What? Just looking out for you. Especially in that outfit. What? Cat's got your tongue? Honestly Holly. You were never really that great of a dancer in the first place. Our team has improved so much without you. Totally. Oh yeah? She's not even that good of a dancer? That would explain all the trophies in her room. Oh right. Didn't she win Miss Teen Dance two years in row? For your information, Holly is perfectly healthy. So back off. Zoey, what's going on here? Mom, Dad? What are you guys doing here? Mr. And Mrs. Anderson. Nice to see you. Oh my gosh. Why are her parents here? She's so weird. Zoey, let's go. - But mom... - Now. Good job! Great job! Way to go! Well done! I can't believe you just did that! That was like the bravest thing I've ever seen. I don't know what came over me! That was so sick! What you just did there, standing up for Holly. That was the coolest thing I've ever seen. It was nothing. I was just being a friend. Well, it was about time someone stood up to them. By the way, how'd you do on that quiz? I aced it! I guess you could call me a genius. Yeah! Oh no. I got to go. I'm going to miss my bus. Okay. See you! Oh my gosh! That was wonderful... So. So now you're starting fights at school? Mom, that wasn't my fault. Oh. Holly's the problem. Oh! It's Holly, honey. Holly's the problem. You know what I think? I think that if you acted a little more like Holly maybe your problems would disappear. Honey! I honestly don't understand. When you behave like this, outside of the home, that they'd even consider giving you a scholarship! I got the scholarship? Is that all you care about? I'm disappointed in you. To say the least. We've got to go. No! Honey. I told you this morning that we have a meeting. You'll have to get your own ride home. Remember this conversation. Yeah. You'll remember this conversation. Okay. Don't you think that went a bit too far? Yeah, I feel like we really hurt Holly. We've known her since we were three. I don't know why Zoey's making us act like this. It's not like we can ditch Zoey. We dance with her. Well. Maybe we should stand up to her? No, I don't think that's a good idea. She's scary. Uhhh! We need a plan. Holly and her deaf freak are going to pay. Stop. Come on you guys. I know you can do so much better than that. We really need to pull it together as a group. This routine, well, it isn't as good as I know it could be. I don't think that it's bad. Face it. We're just not that original. Well, Regionals are in one week. We need to finish and clean up the number. I think I might have something. What are you talking about Holly? Something with an edge. Everyone, meet Isaiah. So this is it, huh? I think we could make this work. Oh, I brought some friends. I hope you don't mind. See what you got! Yeah! Pop... Popcorn... Popcorn... Yeah! Popcorn... Popcorn... ♪ Hands down, you guys have to come up with a group name. Hands Down! Oh, I like that! What! Yeah! ♪ Uh... 8 a.m. tomorrow. Sharp! Noah just said that he can come tomorrow! Are you excited or what? Noooo! Are you crazy? What if I mess up, he'll hate me! Where's this coming from? You know the routine better than anyone else. I get really bad stage fright, especially in front of cute boys. Well. What do you have to lose? You know a wise girl once told me that sometimes you have to let go of your fears in order to find something truly awesome. Besides, at the end of the day all that really matters is the performance coming from your heart. Wow, that's some really good advice. Well, I have a really good friend. Girls, we're going on a road trip. What do you mean? Those losers are going to pay for what they did. Zoey, I don't think that's a good idea. Yeah, we already tried that and it didn't work, so... Maybe we should just stop. Are you guys kidding me? They embarrassed me. I mean us, in front of everyone, including my parents. Perfect. Okay guys. Let's go. Zoey, I don't know. Tia? Yeah. Maybe I'm going to stay here with Tiffany. Ugh, you guys are useless. I have to do everything on my own. Stella. Ryan. Isaiah. Nicole. Tully. Sasha. Alex and Holly. Ralphie... You doing good? Okay, good. All right guys! Are you guys excited? Yeah! The bus won't start, ma'am. What? The bus won't start. I'm going to have to go see what's going on with the engine. What do you mean the bus won't start? Hey, Holly. Are you okay? Okay. Drive the car, we leave now! Put it in drive and drive the car! Wait! This is wrong. Are you okay? This was the plan the whole time. Tia? That's it. I can't do this anymore. Tiffany, I swear if you get out of this car... What? You're going to call me fat too? Ooh, I'm trembling. Okay, drive the car. Guys, look. Oh my gosh. Our costumes are all cut up! That's messed up. Who would do that? It looks like someone thought it would be funny to put water in the gas tank. Are you serious? Wow! We're stranded and if we magically make it to the competition, we have no costumes. Stella's right. We're done. Do you guys hear yourselves right now? We did not come this far just to quit. Stella and Toby. You're two of the most caring people I know. You guys helped me when I really messed up. Remember? Isaiah and crew, without you guys we never would have been inspired to take our performance to the next level. Right? Yeah. And Alex, you pushed me to move forward with my life. And that's what we have to do right now. We have to move forward from this situation. Guys, I believe that we can do anything when we work together. Hands Down! Holly, isn't that Tia's car? Yeah... They sabotaged our bus. Wow! Not cool. What is she doing here? Part of their plan! No! It's not. I came to make amends. Why should we trust you? Look, I'm sorry. Things went way too far. Are there scissors still back there? Yeah. I can help with the costumes. I trust her. Besides do we really have any other choice? Not really. Good news everyone! The bus is up and running. Let's go! Come on guys! Okay. I need scissors, glue, jewels... And welcome back to the fifth annual ASL poetry competition. We hope you enjoyed the brief intermission. Excuse me. Sorry. Please take this time to turn off all cell phones and electronic devices. And remember to remain seated during the performance. The auditorium lights will be dimmed momentarily. Oh, excuse me. Thanks. Now without further ado, sit back, relax and enjoy the final performance of the night. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Hands Down! Ah, it's going to be great. Um, Hands Down? Well folks, looks like we'll be skipping straight to the awards ceremony tonight. Oh Wait... Here they are, Hands Down! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Why are they all doing jazz hands? That's how we clap. That was absolutely amazing! Thank you! I can't believe it! That was like the best time we've ever performed it! I'm just so proud of you. And I know your dad would be too. I'm glad you've found something as beautiful and expressive as dance. Me too. I knew you could do it Alex! You had nothing to worry about! Thanks gram. Alex, when you were on stage... And then... What Dad? I always said you were special. And now the whole world sees it. I'm going to go find Holly. Okay. Sure. Oh! Alex! Hey. Hey. Your performance was amazing! Did you guys do that all on your own? Yeah pretty much. We have a teacher, but she really inspires us to find out own voice. Whoa, that was one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Yeah, I guess. So, uhhh, I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to dinner, or a movie, or... I don't know? You guys were amazing! Thanks. You're welcome. Look, I'm really sorry about how we treated you. Yeah, we really should have stood up to Zoey earlier. But, I loved the poetry. I mean, it's a lot like dancing! And the costumes slayed. You're a genius Tiffany. I know. I've missed you guys. Hold on. I have to go do something. Zoey, I know what you did. I don't know what you're talking about. Fine! Whatever! Tell on me or something. I really don't care. I'm not going to do that.

Will you guys take me back? I'm really sorry, for everything. Thanks Zoey. And I got to say, you guys kind of werked those ripped costumes. Nothing could stop your guys' talent. Yeah, the costumes were all right. So Tia, how was that date with Brian? Well actually... It was amazing! So he liked the super hero movie choice? Yeah! And what about the super hero chic look?
