SAPTHAGIRI LLB [traffic] [vehicle honking] [glass shatters] [gasps] [cheering] [indistinct voices] Hey Sexy! -Hi. -Hi. You look so pretty. -Thank you. -[gives a flying kiss] May I have your phone number? Come on. Hey, are you crazy? Behave yourself. You stupid, I will kill you. What the hell? You bloody bugger! How dare you flirt with our girl! Buzz off, you idiot! [thud] [birds chirping] PUNGANUR What is this, Sreenu? It seems you wore a mask yesterday, snatched that girl returning from college, into the lemon farm and assaulted? What is the matter? Where is the protection for men in this country? If a woman sheds two tears, everybody from our President to American President supports them. Having four-finger rings, five hundred acres of land and as am shining in black, you thought to trap me, girl? Huh? What dear, you said that he wore a mask and how can you be sure it's him? Do you have any proof? It is him, sir. Would anybody go with proof, Aadhar card, ration card, or the Paytm and then assault a girl? Someone wore a mask and assaulted her, but blaming my brother. That is it! Look Rajaiah, there should be proper proofs. If not the case will not stand, right? It is not good to call an elderly man like me to this meeting and insult. Correct yourself, if you have committed any mistakes. Are there any more issues to be sorted? Come on tell me. How dare someone throws a sandal at me? It's size seven sandal, bro. -Whose sandal is this? -Such a beautiful sandal in our village? See where is the other sandal? -Hey! -Go and search for it. Bro, need not search. Even the second sandal is here. Chitti... we should put on mask next time for her. Chitti, why are you over reacting? I respect women and thus I gave you some respect. What is the matter? My brother-in-law is coming to sort this out. He is just passed LLB. He will definitely find out who among you is the culprit? What is LLB? RMP Doctor bro. -What does that mean? -He gives injections to animals. Is it? Do you mean that Sapthagiri fellow? Yes, he is my brother-in-law. Ask him to come. -Call him... Ask him to come. -Where is he? Hey, Sapthagiri... [vehicle honking] "Sapthagiri LLB has arrived..." "Sapthagiri LLB has arrived..." Hey, move... move aside... He dashed. -Hi, brother-in-law. -Chitti. Blacky brother-in-law. Melupatla village in our Punganur Mandal has a very good name. And such an incident taking place in this village is a bad thing. Sir, my daughter was cheated. Shut up, don't you dare to speak again! Your responsibility as a father is to... to bring her up well. She is seen in every restaurant, hotel and park in Madanapalle. You know she goes out with a different guy every day? How could you both blame our innocent Prabhas Sreenu? whose heart is as pure as a child? You know how much would that tender heart suffers? -Brother, what are you talking? -Shut up, you dirty lady! I will not talk with you. What Sapthagiri, why do you talk so cheap about a girl? I clearly understood the situation. He is planning to get you out from this and charge some money. You do not back off and pay him well. Not now but later. When I recently went to Madanapalle that lab assistant, Dhamadri, said a horrible truth about your daughter. But I'm afraid cannot utter those words here. Hey, what is that? Do you know that? Why do you ask me? Ask that fellow. -Giri... -Hey Blacky! Brother-in-law... brother-in-law... I am unable to bear that she has put such blame on you brother-in-law. Brother-in-law, you would have not done it. You are not such a person. Who is the reason that our village has developed so well? -It's Prabhas Sreenu. -Who is the celebrity in our village? -It's Prabhas Sreenu. -Who is the legend? It's Prabhas Sreenu. -Who is a great man? -It's Prabhas Sreenu. -Who is the kind-hearted person? -It's Prabhas Sreenu. Who is an idiot and a human beast? -That too is Prabhas Sreenu. -Hey! You do not know, let me say. But what did that lab guy at Madanapalle say? You ask anything but I cannot tell about that. -Say it out, Giri. -Hey, blacky... This is the problem of our village and I cannot say it. -The whole village should listen, say it. -Say it out, Giri. All of us would get humiliated, and get defamed blacky. -Say it out, Giri... -I will not say, I will not... -Say it out... -Alright, listen to me, Blacky! What happened to that girl? That girl... -That girl...? -That girl...? That girl... -Yes, what happened to that girl? -What happened? is infected with AIDS. Bro. [gasps] My bro has AIDS, he has AIDS. The first gets leprosy when AIDS attacks Limbs and hands get twisted. One loses eyes and mustache. Resulting in the loss of the nose, he will die all of a sudden... -Please go back a bit. -See! How badly my brother-in-law worried about the village even now? Now, I'm not worried about that but about that great man who assaulted this girl. Within 24 hours... Anti-virus HIV injection must be given. Else, he will die. It is already been 23 hours that she is molested. Just an hour is left and he would live if this injection is given. -Tell me who is that great person? -It's me. -Who is that great man? -It's me. -Who is that... -It's me. It is my bro, who molested. -Is that you? -Yes. Excuse me, it is my bro who assaulted that girl physically. -When did he rape? -23 hours ago. -Where has he molested? -In the lemon farm. What were you doing? I was plucking the lemons. -You skinny rogue! -Oh no! My dear President, as this guy molesting her is true, the disease I told she has is false. As per IPC section 376 A, 10 years of imprisonment will be imposed ...for touching one's own wife without her consent. And this person has molested an innocent girl. If he is arrested under Nirbhaya case of IPC section 376, he may get a life imprisonment or 10 lakhs fine and a non-bailable warrant. The judge's mood is off he might impose all the three and hang him to death. So, will he die suffering in jail lifelong or stay happy marrying that girl? You give the judgment. Sorry dear, I'm the son of a farmer as well. As I did not want the daughter of another farmer to have injustice, I had to lie about you. Forgive me, dear. Hey Sreenu, as it is proved that you did the crime, you should marry that girl and keep her happy. Okay. [laughing] [cheering] I like you, brother-in-law.

What is your case early in the morning? Hey, I already have 14 cases today. You bring all idiotic cases, argue foolishly and cause me headache. Have you won at least one case? You just waste the court time. Your honor! The allegation is that my client Mr. Naidu has made his son, perform cesarean surgery just at an age of 14 years. -This is completely false. -Objection, your honor. Dr. Naidu indeed made his son operate. But, he is threatening them from a month. He is trying to close the case using his political influence. I saw that in the paper and presented a PIL in the court, madam. Hey, silence! Your honor, it is true that the small boy was there while the operation was on. As he was rigid to see an operation, he took him in as a father. Just because he was present there, doesn't mean he operated. For instance, last week when your younger daughter, wanted to see the court so you brought and made her sit beside you. Does that mean she has passed the judgement? Hey Bunty, come here. Look at this little boy for once, madam. See how cute is this little fellow with saturated fat. When he can't even spell cesarean, how could he even do it? Even operation theater will not believe. And I cannot believe that you believe this. Huh? You have to believe, your honor. He let him do this operation to get his son's name enrolled in the Guinness Book. Any evidence? Yes, your honor. I downloaded it from Facebook, your honor. What is it? Hell with you and your Facebook! Okay, cool. I will take care. Heights of stupidity! What Doctor, do you have no sense? What is wrong in it, madam? It happens nowhere in this world that a 14 years boy operated. They are appreciating in phones from Russia, America and England nations. They are offering in lakhs saying to give a job. As the Doctor himself agreed, I am requesting to punish him rigorously. Your honor, Sachin Tendulkar at an age of 16 years and 205 days has debuted into cricket at Karachi in Pakistan. If he was stopped thinking as a small boy and would get hurt, do we have a cricket God today? Malavath Purna of 16 years age, a Telugu girl from our Nizamabad, has made our national flag fly high on the Mount Everest We wrote great about her in our headlines. If she was stopped thinking it as dangerous, would the fame of Telugu go worldwide? Our 14 years aged Bunty belonging to a similar category, has operated and got a success means, your honor... this a bad day... sorry, great day in medical history. Look man, one may have any great talent. But what if the patient had lost life? But she didn't lose her life.Both mother and the baby are safe. My Lord, please give it a thought and grant bail to my client. What you said is good to listen logically but against rules. I cannot give a bail under any section. Hey, to know more about me, ask the knife I operate with, or ask the needle I stitch with and they would say. Madam! 22 Kidney operations, 33 heart operations, 44 eye operations and did 55 piles operations. I have even done 99 sex-change operations. If required, I am promising to do the 100th for free to anyone here. -[indistinct voices] -Order... -Hey! I'll do the sex operation to you. -You should not talk like this. You are not understanding. Buzz off, you short fellow! Do you think this is a court or a market? Your honor, he spoke like that, as his sugar levels went high. You get all crazy cases, the court is adjourned. -Madam, sister. -Hey! Will you not visit my hospital someday and not get operated by me? -Hey! I will then teach you a lesson. -Take him away. -Constable, take him away first. -[indistinct voices] -Leave! -Please, sister. District court today has denied bail to Dr. Naidu. Lawyer Subash who filed the PIL on this case is with us. Tell us, Mr. Subash, what happened in the court? Dr. Naidu for Guinness record made his son aged 14 operate. Lawyer, Sapthgiri LLB on the side of that Doctor, brought a cake, impressed the Judge and made a fool of himself as he could not win the case. That is the matter. Why have put a long face? Because of losing the case? Hmm! Sir, I used to win any case at my place just like that. [sighs] That is the Panchayat and this is the court. Hell with the courts, sir! Even God is not cooperating with me. Hey, father gives birth, teacher gives education but God will not give the victory. We should achieve it. Listen to me and go to the higher courts. There would be big cases. You will get the experience and the knowledge grows. Then the success will come in search of you. All the best. -Hey Buddy! -Sister is inside. Get down, I got my information. -In unison: Good morning, brother-in-law. -Good morning. Brother-in-law, you said you'd come for lunch and didn't turn up. You know, I brought lemon rice for you. I am hurt. Chitti, I should talk to you. Come on, I will tell you. Where are you taking me, brother-in-law? Wait. Chitti, I am planning to shift to Hyderabad. Why? Are you bored of me? Why will I get bored of you, Chitti? All here are making fun of me and there is none to encourage, you know? If I go to Hyderabad, there would be big cases, big courts and big lawyers. I will join as an Apprentice to them and win with experience. I anyways have my brother-in-law there and he would help me. Have you again lost the case brother-in-law? -Hmm. -Shall I tell you something? You should have the luck to win a case. Marry me and you will win all the cases. Will luck come along if I marry you, Chitti? This sounds good. Come on, let us go and get married. Hey! Where are you taking my daughter? Father, I am going to marry brother-in-law. She is mine! I am going to Hyderabad. I will acquire all the qualifications required to marry her. and then come back. If you try to play any tricks I will have to teach you a lesson. I love you. 6 MONTHS LATER Brother, is it an extramarital affair? Why do you say divorce when we just married! Come on, darling. Hey, I will argue your divorce case in the next six months, do remember. -Hey Punganur! -Yeah. You turned the court into a bus stand. -Damn! Hey, juniors. -In unison: Yes, boss! It has been six months and I'm couldn't get even one case. My village was better, whether I won or lost, but I used to get 25 cases a day. Do not worry, boss. I will get a wonderful case. We will have continuous money flow for a month. -Do something. -You take this bill. Hey, brother. -Yeah! -You should do me a small favor, bro. I will pay if you want. Are the cops distributing money to the lawyers these days? What is the matter? Nothing, bro. We brought five-member robbery gang of Dandupalyam batch. One from those has escaped and we have the argument today. -Moreover the entire media is right here. -So? If you stand before the media in the getup of that escaped guy, my job is safe. You, bloody rascal! Do I look like a dirty thief for you? I will give you five thousand. Fold it and keep it in your underwear pocket. Brother, my daughter's wedding is in a week and I will lose my prestige. Wedding might be called off. I beg you. I'm convinced as you said that your daughter's wedding is on cards. Added it is been very long since I did a disguised role. Basically, that's what I am. Here, everything is in this bag. -You are not trapping me, right? -No. You will manage, right? See the rest on the screen. "Moon of Chittore..." "Hey Shakalaka Shankar... Here I come..." Hey! Who are you idiot, dashing? Are you blind? You look like a guy who eats insects on the Discovery channel. -[gasps] -Hey! What did you say? You look like the guy who eats insects... -...on Discovery channel. -Hey! I will kill this fellow and drink his blood... I will kill this fellow and drink his blood. Hey...! I will kill one per one shot... Hey... Buzz off! He did not recognize it. Hey, move aside... Move... Hey, who are you, rascal? Who are you, idiot? Ours is Dandupalyam gang. Ours is Bangarupalyam batch. -Hey, I will cut the throats. -We cut the goats. Hey, why are you talking with those murderers? -Am I living in the role? -Shucks! Move. Swathi, police have just shown up the Dandupalyam batch murderers, arrested a week back, before the media. This batch is notorious as cold blooded murderers. Public groups are demanding to encounter and hang these dreaded murderers in public. It's live. -Hey! -Am I looking handsome? There are intelligence bureau reports that, there could be an attack... -Will they kill? -...these may be killed any time. They are media, right? They will have their reports. -Hey, are you laying a death bed for me? -Believe me. In unison: [gasps] Hey, their men are coming. Runaway. -Will they kill me? -Hey! -Hey! -Hey! He is the main leader of Dandupalyam batch. Me? It is not me. Kill that fellow. Runaway! Hey! Hey, it is not me dude. I beg you. Who are you, guys? Oh no, he hit me Bro, I beg you. I don't belong to Dandupalyam batch. I am from Punganur. [indistinct voices] Oh my God! He is killing. -Hey, I'm not aware of anything! -[indistinct voices] [stabbing] -Hey! -[shouts] They are chopping as if they are some vegetables. [shouts] You get in. Aunty, come fast... they are dropping bombs. Come on. Move, where is Eswari aunty? Hey Eswari aunty, have you come for marriage to walk slowly? -Hell with you idiots! -Move-in faster. [explosion] [screams] Hey, I am not from Dandupalyam batch. I just did this role just for time pass. -Don't come closer. Hey, it is not me. -Hey! [gun shots] [groans] Boss, you would have been to the buffalo of Yama by now. -Boss, you are an Everest in acting. -Thank you. Aunty, at least you say to our boss. Hey, do you have any sense at all? If you are crazy for acting then you should go and act in films, but why are you doing all of these at a court? Brother-in-law, what happened now? Why are you so angry? Sit down. Uncle, four cups of tea. It is coming, son. -Hey, Khasim... -Sir. Bring four cups of tea quickly to table six. Yes, sir. Brother-in-law, who is it? He is the great Rajpal. Rajpal? -[clamour] -Wait... Move... Move aside. Hey you, move... Move aside. Please. -Move aside, please. -Move aside. Six thousand four hundred and sixteen. The number of accidents occurred in Hyderabad last year are, six thousand four hundred and sixteen. But I have a doubt, your honor. How many from them are remembered by those sitting here? But from the past six months, it feels like total media has focused on just one single accident. The so-called Toyota Fortuner hit and run case. Which involves the most respected and the law-abiding families of the city. Because making these as headlines, circulation of papers and TRPs of channels rise high. Everyone tries to blame the rich in our country. The reason is jealousy. But your honor, not even a single proof is found in relation to this case. The proofs must exist to present. The name of my client Rohit is added two days after the FIR is prepared. Why? It is never been proved that Rohit was present at the accident site. Never! Your honor, though the case is running from six months, the prosecution could not present at least one evidence till now. None has directly witnessed this accident. Before I forget, where is the great imaginary Toyota Fortuner, in this Toyota Fortuner hit and run case? By the way, as per the report of Sub-inspector Patnaik, a truck caused this accident, not a car. Sir, you have the investigation reports with you. -Ok, I too have that copy. -Yes, sir. Your honor, media and prosecution are unnecessarily making this case a sensation. There is no single evidence or proof... Nothing. In fact, there is no scope in this case at all, your honor. It is crystal clear that Rohit's name is involved in this case purposefully. Your honor. Rohit caused this accident and the court should not believe him as innocent. What would it believe then? This is a court, speak only if you have proofs and evidence. I am demanding for proofs. Where is the evidence? Where is that Toyota Fortuner and where are the witnesses? Huh? All of you have come to an understanding. When you file a case on such rich families, you assume that they fear, come for a compromise and give you money. This is what you expected, isn't it? And now the media outside the court. They have nothing to do with any proof or inquiry. Full of a publicity stunt! Let me remind you, Mr. Prosecutor. This is not a media trial, this is a real trial. [gasps] There is no value for the judgments of media in this country. Judgment by the judge sitting there is the final. That is all, your honor. You still have not lost the touch of your passionate speeches, Mr. Rajpal. I am impressed. Thank you, your honor. Mr. Apparao, any further submission? Your honor, if court gives me some time, I am planning to re-investigate on some points in this case. How much more time do you need? Sit down. Okay. As the prosecution could not prove that Rohit caused this accident, the case is closed and judgment is being given that Rohit is innocent. Yes, I won. -That is Rajpal. -The court is adjourned. Congratulations. [clapping] Sir, hello. -That was awesome, good. -Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Rajpal. Yes. Love you, uncle. Come Sunny -Meet you soon. -Hey, come guys. Sir... Sir, I am your big fan. My name is Sapthagiri. I am also an advocate, sir. Sir, what I could not learn from 3 years in college, you said it great in just three minutes, sir. Wow, you argued great sir. Having heard about you all these days and when I could see you directly today... Whoa! It's overwhelming sir! I need your blessings, sir. -May I go? -Sure. Sir... Bless our boy, sir. -Hey, damn! Idiots! -Sir, please bless me. -Sir, please bless me. -Sir. -Madam, please bless him. -Madam, please bless me. -Hey, you damn! -Hey! You leave, madam. Idiots, you just ruined our image. Lawyer sir, you have finally saved our prestige. Rohit is the future of our family. I must say, he is all gone by this grandfather. Still, such mistakes do take place in his age. But doesn't mean we spend our lives going around the courts. I completely agree with you, Diwan sir. Who hasn't committed a mistake in this country? Foot paths are not built to sleep. Still, what our Rohit did was a service to nation. He cleaned the waste on the foot path and threw it to aside. Correct! Yogi... Yes, Rajpal. Here is your full and final settlement. And thank you very much. Sir... cheque... What happened, any problem? But we agreed upon a different amount, isn't it? There are so many people involved in this case and I should satisfy all of them. But, take it. You can satisfy all them with this money. And do not be greedy, greed is not good. But still this case is closed in just six months, right? Even your heir has returned in six months, right? Yogi... make it thirty. Rajpal uncle. Hey! -I am very happy today. -Good. It is all because of you. Dad, pay ten lakhs to uncle. It's thirty lakhs not ten lakhs. What, thirty lakhs? -For blabbering for just five minutes... -No, that is not right. It's for arguing. Be happy. -Diwan, sir. -Hmm. Thank you, thank you very much. -Take care of your health. -Okay. Bye. "Take the offering... Oh uncle, take this offering" "Oh uncle, take this offering" Shut up! Look Apparao bro, you lost and what do you say now? -"Oh Rajpal sir..." -Exactly! Exactly! "Those eyes resemble the owl, hey Rajpal..." Come on! "The voice resembles roar of the lion, hey Rajpal" "He always keeps saying 'fire' and 'relax" JUDGMENT OF HIT AND RUN CASE WITHOUT THE EYE WITNESS DISSATISFACTION AMONG BEGGARS WITH THE COURT JUDGMENT JUDGMENT OF HIT AND RUN CASE WITHOUT THE EYE WITNESS DISSATISFACTION AMONG BEGGARS WITH COURT JUDGMENT Hey Tippu. Have they closed this case because there was no eye witness? Boss, it is Rajpal on the other side. Even if there is an eye witness, judgment comes in favor of Rajpal. What if the eyewitness is brought in? It is still difficult, boss. My father-in-law is says that he would not get me married, to Chitti unless I win a case. What if I put a PIL on this case and win? Give it a try, boss. [music mutes voice] -Advance congrats, boss. -Thank you. -Shake hands one after the another. -Thank you, thank you. -Thank you. -Boss, all the best. -Hey boss, they are our aunts. -Hey, order tea for all. What about the money then? -We will pay through Paytm. -Oh, is it? -Hey bring tea. -Hey Giri! -Hey! -Uncle. -Bujjulu, how are you? -I am good. A small gift from uncle for you. Yeah! This looks like a broken piece of pencil and do you call this as a chocolate? And that's my financial situation, dear. I just filed a PIL in the court. Let me win that case and I will make you open a chocolate factory. No need, it is time for my school. -She has gone by my Vani sister. -Bye daddy, bye uncle. Bye. Hell with your success! It seems you've filed a PIL against to Rajpal? -His nonsense has started. -What do you know about Rajpal? Ok, tell us what you know. He can prove that sea has no salt and that the Sun rises in the West. Brother-in-law, I somehow put a PIL to win and why are you discouraging instead of encouraging? This is just my trial with the blessings of the God. That is your ignorance. You idiot, it is Rajpal there. Brother-in-law, I just tried. I will either succeed or it will be an experience. Listen to me... Hey... Who is Sapthagiri here? It is me, sir. Why did you file this PIL? The Police have investigated. Even the previous Judge might have given a good judgment. Why do you need a reinvestigation? A mere waste of time. Your honor, it was clearly written in Eenadu paper last Friday. That the cops have hidden many truths in this case and got the case closed. They even ran hours of programs even in news channels. Even interviews of the eyewitness were printed in paper. But no eye witness was called to court and inquired, your honor. Hey, wait man. What is your name? Sapthagiri, LLB. Where did you study LLB? Punganur. BRGJ Law College. Has none taught you there that the media stories will not be accepted in the court? Yes, they taught me. Why do you nod? Say something. What is this? You wrote appeal as apple. You wrote prosecution as prostitution. My ill fate, what is this? How can I accept this if there are five mistakes every line? Damn! I subject, your honor. I subject. Where are you all specimen from? It's object but not subject! Yes, I said the same. I said subject. When my boss wants to win a case against a big guy, instead of encouraging why are you making fun of him? Hey, what is your name? Shakalaka Shankar. The name sounds different. Thank you, your honor. Go to that corner and kneel down to wall till the case ends. This is your punishment. Will you talk as you like with a judge? Huh? Your honor, what I mistaken? Boss, tell him. I do not know who he is. Oh no, sir. I just replaced my knees as the old were worn away. They are not available anywhere here, made in Barampur. I beg you, please show mercy. Okay, go and kneel down till this evening. [gasps] Till the evening? -Sir, show some more mercy. -Do you still feel funny? Get away. I will do it. Not showing your back dear, turn this way.. Oh! What is that sound? I didn't fart. My pants ripped. Oh God, you are a great guy! Come on lift your hands up. What is it, again? I farted now. I had dal rice. You should be careful before coming to the court. Your honor, you may have to suffer if you do not leave me. [laughing] Order... Sapthagiri, you tell me. Sir, I will get the evidence if you give me some time. Don't you know that you can file the case only after having the evidence? You wasted the court's time. I am giving you two days time. -Okay. -If you do not bring evidence by then, I will throw your PIL in the dustbin. Boss, will you not go home? -You go Tippu, I will come. -Okay, bye. -Excuse me. -Yes. -Mr. Sapthagiri... -It's me. Is it you who filed the PIL in that Rohit case? Yes, it's me.. Do you have any problem? Problem? No, sir. I felt happy. My name is Albert Pinto, sir. I stay in Vijayawada. I have a small business and so I regularly travel to Hyderabad. On that night of January 20th, I was in city. While I was returning to the hotel after watching a film, that accident took place in front of my eyes, sir. I am the one and only witness remaining in this case, sir. What have you done all these days, sir? I did, sir. I did everything that a common man should do. I went to the Police station and gave a complaint. Do you have the complaint copy? They said that they would call me. They didn't call me till date. Will you come to the court and give the witness? If there is a daring lawyer like you behind me, I will come anywhere and do anything, sir. Rajpal, you are done. A new twist in the Toyota Fortuner hit and run case. Lawyer Sapthagiri filed the PIL, submitted new affidavit and created a sensation in this accident case. Sapthagiri said to the media that he has an eye witness, named Albert Pinto in this case. The court accepted the affidavit and ordered Advocate Rajpal on the side of the convict, to attend in person for the next adjournment. As a challenge for judiciary system, Sapthagiri, LLB reopened the Toyota Fortuner hit and run case standing. The weapon in the hands of Sapthagiri is the eye witness Albert Pinto. By filing PIL against the great senior most advocate Rajpal, Sapthagiri, LLB has become an overnight star. DISTRICT AND SESSIONS COURT Oh, Mr. Rajpal! Have you come? Not just the supreme court and the high court... Please keep visiting the lower courts too, sir. We would boast that a great lawyer like you came and argued here. Nothing as such sir, I have been little tired up. -My Lord. -Tell me. I meant, we have the eye witness, Albert Pinto... Who is the eye witness? But I already submitted in the affidavit sir. Where is he? He is here. Call him if he is here. Is he that Pinto? -Go. All the best, Pinto. -Come on man, come on. Albert Pinto. Name sounds different. Your height and weight are good. Do you play any Pro Kabaddi? No, sir. I just have a business. -Sir. -Business? -Mr. Albert Pinto. -Yes, sir. As said in your affidavit, on the night of the accident, you were there and moreover you saw Rohit too? Yes, sir. Look man, where did the accident take place? Punjagutta, sir. When did it take place? On January 20th, Friday night at around 1:00 am. What were you doing there at that time? I was returning from the second show movie. Which movie? Khaidi number 150. Is it Chiranjeevi's film? Your honor, Police complaint coffee... It's not coffee man but a copy. Yes, I already submitted the same copy and the cinema tickets. Okay. Mr. Rajpal, do you want to say anything? Your honor, before I say anything please arrange an AC here. -It is sweating here. -Is it? How are you even working for eight hours here? It is just going on like this, sir. It has been two months since we applied to the government for an AC and there is no response till date. The fan is working and that is a boon for us. Leave all that, do you have anything to say in this regard? I haven't seen the affidavit as I had been to Shimla with family for summer trip. I would appreciate if you could give us another day. Mr. Sapthagiri, you have no objections, right? I have no objection, sir but I have a small request. If you can call Rohit for the next adjournment, Albert would identify him. And the case would close fast, sir. Mr. Sapthagiri, this is a court and nothing here would close fast. I do not understand on what grounds is my client being further victimized. Mr. Rajpal, I am here right? You do not get tensed. There is no need for your client to be present in the court. But why? But, he is an youngster and gets bored at home. If he is brought in here, he would visit the court and have some fresh air too. I am adjourning this case to the 10th date and we shall meet then. Mr. Rajpal, they gave order to let Rohit be present for the next date, right? -What are your comments on this? -[indistinct voices] Well, we will respect the court orders and what else? What if Albert Pinto identifies Rohit? If you ask these silly questions, he will identify you. Do you know what evidence does he have? Do you know? Is it the cinema ticket? Khaidi Number 150! Come with some smart questions, please. -Sir, one minute, please... -[indistinct voices] -Hey, Mr Sapthagiri is here. -[indistinct voices] Tell us, sir. -Mr Sapthgiri. -Yes. Are you taking the proceedings today in the court as a small victory? Yes, why not? We treat this as our first victory. Yes! In addition, suspect Rohit is called to the court means that, ...we partly succeeded in this case. Sir, we wish to do a special program on this case at our studios. Can you come? -Yes, we will come. Why not? -Thank you, sir. Will you arrange a car? Sure, sir. -What about the lunch in the afternoon? -Yes, sir. In unison: Then we will come. -Sir, still. -Yes, take. Our boss is not less in posing. He spends half his time of practice for this. Remove the glasses. Rock it. Come on change the pose... Great boss! Uncle, for whom is such a big chamber? For the future lawyer, Sapthagiri. Have you vacated half your canteen and made a chamber for me? Hey son, you are arguing a very big case. You need so many facilities to compete with that Rajpal. I have been waiting from these 16 years to see the man to oppose him. A man to oppose him has come after so long. Yes. Though you are new, you were ready to fight. Yes. I see something in you. You will win for sure. You should win. Bless me, uncle. God will give the best, son. He would do for sure. Yes. You rocked it, Giri. Really nice of you. Brother-in-law, all of you are like ATM and I am like Paytm and thus developed fast. -Anyway, congratulations. -It is okay but... ...what is the story of this Rahim uncle? Rahim uncle? See that girl in the photo, she is his daughter. She is Reshma and is a good topper. Mayor's son and his friends molested and killed her. Rajpal gave entered at the time when their punishment was almost confirmed. You know about Rajpal, right? He reversed all the witnesses and brought all of them out as innocents. Despite being in the Judiciary system, with the pain of not being able to do justice to their girl his health deteriorated and he is running the canteen. But, he is a loyal person. Anyway, you are great as you impressed such a person. -Anyway, call mother once. -Okay. Congrats boss, all the beggars of city came to meet you. Where are they? -In unison: Greetings, sir. -Greetings. My dear beggars! As I filed a PIL and am fighting for in order to do justice to you, do not try to felicitate me. -Sir, what we wanted to say is... -You do not say anything. I can understand the pain in your heart by looking into your eyes. You will get the justice and that's all! -Brother, that is... -Sister. in this Hyderabad city at every center, temple, street and junction, I will fight towards a ten rupee donation is made once you raise the hand and beg. The footpaths on which you got injustice, I'll fight with the government and get you documents saying that they are your own. Hey big beggar, from today the footpaths are yours, they are yours. It's not that, sir. Listen to what we are saying... Come on, what? What are you blabbering? By any chance, will you pay me the money you begged as fees? Hey Tippu, send them away. -Hey, move guys... -Hey, move guys... Hello... Chitti... I didn't get the signal. Chitti, am I audible? Hello Hello, brother-in-law... Chitti. Do you know I recently filed a PIL in the court and became a superstar. All my colleagues and media are talking about me. I was seen in the media and you know how handsome was I? Is it, brother-in-law? Meanwhile, I wore a sari today. Wow, Chitti. You look very beautiful in a saree. By the way, what is special? My father has arranged alliance for me. Alliance? But I did not agree. I hit him bad and sent him away, brother-in-law. -[gibberish] -In unison: Buzz off! Look Chitti, I am missing you. I love you, Chitti. I love you too. "For the sound of the bangles on the hand" "Heart is flying like a kite" "Hey, it is a disturbance in the heart" "Seeing your nose stud" "It is great even in fasting" "Hey, what is this?" "Earth and sky are upside down" "Hey sister-in-law, love you" "Hey... Hey..." "Hey... Hey..." "Hey... Hey..." "Hey... Hey..." "It is a love game" "And the moon is my maternal uncle" "This game of shy and love" "Is very surprising at this moment" "Hey, evil-eyed lady, I fell in your love" "Oh!" "I ruined a lot in your thoughts" "Hey lovely babe" -"Hey, Sapthagiri has got the phone" -"Phone" -"His sister-in-law, Chitti called him" -"Chitti" -"She conveyed about alliance" -"The matter" -"Groom has come for the marriage" -"Groom" -"She put him a flower" -"Flower" -"Chitti's father became a scape goat" -"A scape goat" "The beautiful lip has asked in greed" "The size zero waist has asked to pinch" "Your sharp looks are like..." "...celebrations in the heart of the boy" "In between your waterfalls like hair," "My life is disturbed" "Come Chitti, I will take care of you like a queen" "Oh!" "Shall I hold your finger, whistle and turn as your hubby?" "Hey, evil-eyed lady, I fell in your love" "Oh!" "I ruined a lot in your thoughts" "Hey lovely babe" Sapthagiri...! Who the hell is this Sapthagiri? He is nothing, nobody! After all, just one SMS is enough to close him down. Just one SMS... That is it! Then do it. But the problem here is not Sapthagiri. Albert Pinto! Honest bloody citizen! What can Sapthagiri do if he is not there? It's because of that Albert Pinto. The total media is again focusing on this case. Albert Pinto! [train honking] -Sapthgiri. -Hmm. What is this suddenly, brother? I mean, I am a bit tensed thinking of the court and witness tomorrow. Of course, it has to be. Is this any normal case? The entire media would focus on us tomorrow. You just identify the accused Rohit in the court tomorrow and entire court will cheer. I will show my power, and justice prevails. By chance, if I do not identify Rohit in the court? -What if I give witness against you? -Bro, you are unnecessarily scared. Both of us would become big fools if you do even a small mistake tomorrow. Please be cool and be brave. I will take care of anything. I am here and please believe me. Brother, you are not understanding. They are very big people. And more dangerous people than that. Our lives would go upside down if something goes wrong tomorrow. We cannot bear it. Brother, justice is on our side no matter how big or dangerous they are. We are fighting for the beggars living on the roads. Let us fight for the justice. Justice! I am not a fool to not to understand, whether you are fighting for justice or the experience or for the publicity. Okay, ignore this nuisance, brother. I will directly come to the point. I had a deal with Rohit's family for 2 crores. And 10% for you. That means 20 lakhs. What do you say? Brother, what is in money? Let us win this case tomorrow and see the fame we get. Money too will automatically follow with that. Yet they came for a compromise with the money means, they lost half of this case. Please brother, be with me tomorrow in the court. I will make that Rajpal go weak in the knees. -Is that Rajpal afraid of you? -Hmm. -Shall we both together get Rajpal scared? -Hmm. You exactly proved to have come from a village, brother. So cute! Do you know who I am? I am the man of Rajpal. I actually did not go to any police station nor did I watch watch any movie. I do not have any relation with this case at all. All this is Rajpal's screenplay. And you are a dummy character in that. Still, you are very lucky, brother. You got so much publicity just in a month after filing the PIL. Such a heavy payment even when you are losing. You are somehow lucky. Yes, I remembered... by payment. Here are 4 lakhs. Take... Your advance! Your hands are shivering. That is Rajpal. Enjoy! Send an SMS to Rajpal sir saying 'Thank you, sir.' You will get a surprise gift if he is happy. Wow...! He is not an ordinary fellow...! He is not an ordinary fellow! I should learn a lot from him. You said that you would come to the bus stand and didn't come. I felt bad, because of you. I thought the entire game was in my hands but they fixed the match. Really hats off! Rajpal is genius and thus has become number one lawyer in India. You know, there is nothing wrong in the public bowing and saluting to him. He deserves it. He deserves to be in that place, that is it. What happened? Tell me clearly. I did not even understand whether I won or lost in this deal. What is this deal, brother-in-law? Our witness Albert Pinto is the man of Rajpal. He set the deal for 2 crores and gave us an offer for 20 lakhs and gave an advance of 4 lakhs, you know? That means, did you take a bribe brother-in-law? Hey! Why do you say bribe? If I go, set a deal and then get money from them, then it is called a bribe. But they have come and put money in my hands. That means, it is like I won in this case morally. You think so, but to say it openly you behaved like a broker. Why do you say a broker? [plate clunks] Mental! Yes, I am a broker and brought money. For whom did I get it? I brought it for you and for us. I brought for our future. Did you bring it for me? Did I ask for any cars or bungalows? I just wished that you should prosper. Is earning money not prospering? Should I not earn money to prosper? Is the money earned over the dead bodies of the beggars called an income? I don't need you to take care of me with that money. Mr. Rajpal, give this money to Pinto to settle and get my son out from the case fast. Mr. Yogi. One second. What is this? For me to have blabbered... sorry. the cheque of 30 lakhs you gave to me for arguing. I will take this only after getting Rohit completely out of the case. No. Thank you so much. -Vivek. -Yes, sir. Keep it inside. Vivek. Sir. You will not get greedy seeing so much money, right? Do not be greedy. No sir, but you are a genius. What do you know the meaning of greed, you fools? Your properties are not enough to buy the brain of this Rajpal. I only demand what I deserve. Nobody can call me greedy. No sir, he is not that person. Mr. Pinto, it was you who wrote in the affidavit, that you saw Rohit that day night, right? Say the truth, is he Rohit or not? No, sir. I am sure. I am seeing him for the first time. I thought to identify seeing the photo in the newspaper, but this is not him at all, sir. Mr. Pinto, you know how valuable is your witness in this case, right? Of course, I know, sir. But for that we cannot get an innocent guy into this case, right sir? Wow, well said. You are the right man for these present times. Sapthagiri, do you wish to say anything? No, your honor, no arguments. Thank you. When you have settled this case somewhere outside, why do you come to the Court then? Is it to strain our brains? It is alright. I am adjourning this case to another date. -Sir, do you think you'd win this case? -[indistinct voices] As usual, we will win. Victory will be ours, okay? What Giri, it seems you took 20 lakhs from Rajpal. Who told you? Whole court is saying it aloud. -Such matters cannot be hidden. -Boss. I heard that you earned lakhs. I love you, boss. You are great boss. Mwah! -You are super boss. -Hey, wait dude. Do you fail to understand? There should be some professional ethics even to earn, you know? Oh no, ethics! You have been with the black coat on from 10 years. You will not allow earning even a rupee in the wrong way. Our boss has just stepped in and has become a collection king and a corruption king. -Damn! -Boss, I am saying now... You are greater than that Rajpal. Come on whistle, dude. Uncle. Uncle. As the eye witness Albert Pinto couldn't identify the accused in the Rohit's case, this case has again come to a closure state. The shocking news is that, it seems like a settlement has taken place between both the parties off record. That means, it is once again proved that life of the poor is cheaper, than the car of rich. Legal analysts are saying that the reasons behind lawyer Sapthagiri to file a PIL, was to get popular and to earn money. After the court has adjourned, as both eye witness Albert Pinto and lawyer Sapthagiri went missing, the doubts are further strengthened. Public committees are demanding to suspend such lawyers, for lifetime from the bar council. To say openly you behaved as a broker and did mediation Have I asked any cars or bungalows? I just wished that you should prosper. Is the money earned over the dead bodies of the beggars too, an income brother-in-law? I don't need you to take care of me with that money. Hey son, you are arguing a big case. I have been waiting from these 16 years for a guy to oppose that Rajpal. A man to oppose him has come after so long. You will win for sure and should win. I heard that you took 20 lakhs from Rajpal? You know, there should be some professional ethics even to earn? Is the money earned over the dead bodies of the beggars... -... too an income brother in law? -I have been waiting from these 16 years, for a guy to oppose that Rajpal. You know, there should be some professional ethics even to earn? I don't need you to take care of me with that money. [vehicle honking] Dear. Will you go aside and pee? This is the place we daily sleep. [devotional songs playing] [priest chanting] Congrats sir, God has shown mercy in the form of Rajpal sir, and sent you a surprise gift Your future would change if I say the features of this. It has powerful steering, powerful window, powerful engine, powerful accelerator and even the color is not faded. Bro, a second hand car is best even if it is a tar or a mud road. It goes very smooth to drive. This is the car, bro. You drive this car from today and rock it, bro. [glass shattering] Bro, stop bro... Ouch! [glass shattering] [music mutes voice] Why do have get that emotional? You should be very happy to be fighting me just at the beginning of your career. I see! All the opposition lawyers who lost over me, have kept my photo in their respective chambers. You too can have it. Oh! Public is speaking high of you, as you have faced Tejendar Rajpal. I see. But, 20 lakhs is too huge for you. -I think your career is set. Leave! -Oh! What are these sighs dude, am I telling a story? Huh? -Hey! -[gasps] What I am thinking is, if one's career is set just by losing to you, maybe our life gets set if I win over you. What do you say? That is why, I went to the temple, prayed to God, distributed that bribe money to those beggars. I made a scrap out of your car. I came and sat before you and I will win over you. What are you blabbering, idiot? Now this guy Vivek, had his first case with me. I made him lose bad and now he is holding the files. Is it so, idiot? And she... Hey! The post to clean my shoes is vacant and you can take that. Whether this Chittore guy cleans the shoes or make you run without dress, let us see in the court. You have gained good glamor with the corrupted money, uncle. What idiot, don't you see the hierarchy? You think you can speak so rude and step out of this office? Hey uncle, is that a smile? Hey! [glass shattering] This is Yoga body and will play kabaddi with everyone. Take the shot and you are out! I will aim and hit he bulls eye! Mind it! Hey! Have you gone mad? You warned Rajpal it seems! It seems you had been to Rajpal's office and hit his staff too? Brother-in-law, he messed with the sober man, I will see his end. Only one of us, must be left. Will you not change at all? He will change brother-in-law. Buzz off, you idiot? Look... I need the video footage taken right after the accident. Will you do or not? Okay, I will do. "Hey Rathalu...!" "Seeing you my shirt buttons say they cannot stay intact anymore" Hell with your song! Who asked you to sing? You sing, Anasuya. -"My shirt buttons" -Correct. Though you are old, you sing pretty well. You will pay for this. -Good evening, sir. -Good evening. Be seated. Not bad, many turned up for the SHO post's auction. You know the conditions required for getting this post, don't you? Higher officials ordered me to give this post to only those with a clean image We will now see whose image is clean. Okay? Yes! Why are you all looking at each other like thieves? -First start the auction, sir. -Why not! We should pray to God, right? The Government rate is 10 lakhs. 15 lakhs. -20 lakhs. -25 lakhs. -35 lakhs. -[gasps] Hey Babu Rao! Have you gone deaf? Didn't you listen? This is only for a guy with a clean image but not for a cheater like you How dare you to teach me growing weed in your own apartment? Hey, don't you dare to blame me saying weed. What will you do, rascal? -[chaos] -Hey...! Hold on...! Come and be seated. Sit down. Sir, I will pay 40 lakhs. Give me that post, sir. -Of course... -I just have two years for retirement. Give that post only to me, sir. Hey old fellow, you fooled him thrice till now and why do you want that post? Hey, don't you have shame at all? You burnt your wife alive along with your mother's help -and came out from jail on bail, right? -Damn! I got clean chit long back in that case. Sir, do not give it to that fellow. Sir, do not give him. Give it to me. Both of you move. Give that post to me, sir. Sir, give it to me. -Sir, give it to me... -[indistinct voices] Stop it Why are you fighting as if you want a Jio sim? He says no for that guy and he says not for this guy. Whom shall I give it then? In unison: Give it to him, sir. You must be lucky, dude. Meanwhile Bhattacharya, are there any cases filed against you? There was an eve teasing case long back in 2006, sir. Eve teasing? -That is not any big scar. -Is it? -Start the auction. -65 lakhs, sir. Going once, going twice... In unison: Going thrice! Give it to him. You got it, idiot! -Hello, Guruji sir. -Hello, Mr. Kiran. -You asked the CD, right? -Yes, sir. Who is he? He is my brother-in-law, Sapthagiri. -Hello, Mr. Giri. -Hello, sir. He started practice recently and is fighting for the justice. Yes, please do. If you arrange for that CD... You asked as if it's a film CD. That is an accident CD. You know how many VIPs are behind that? I'll lose my job if something goes wrong. We can't move ahead if you deny for this sir. -You should do something. -Yes, it can be done but... It costs ten lakhs. -Ten? -Ten? Why are so tensed as if I asked some 10 crores. Forget 10 lakhs but somehow manage with this 2 lakhs, sir. Two? Shall I cut the CD into half and give? Just two? Do one thing, give me 20% commission in every case you take up for an year. 20%? Can't you pay me 20%? You will give. You will, right? -20? -Yes, very low. Okay, sir. Good! Come tomorrow morning and take the CD. Your honor, may I know what is happening here? They brought Albert Pinto last time and that guy... And now they brought a fake CD worth 10 rupees. What exactly is the relation of that CD to this case? Your honor, I think Mr. Rajpal has not seen that CD properly. Please rewind it once again, sir. Stop, Stop... Your honor TS 09 EA 9999, this car is registered on the name of Yogi Diwan. I already submitted those registration and purchase papers. Please look into them once, your honor. Switch on the lights. Your honor, I wish to present the constable shooting that video as witness. With your permission, sir. Sorry, your honor. Kids these days are becoming lawyers without knowing the rules. They are arguing in the court watching films. -It would be so if all such fools... -Who the hell is a fool here? ...become lawyers. You are asking to call random people as witness... Is this any function at your house to invite all at your wish? [laughing] Before submitting a witness in the court, you have to submit advance notice to the witness, court and the defense team. You should present the witness only after the court gives the permission to. You have come without knowing even this. Your honor, I might have made a mistake but please listen to me once. Hey, we will meet again in the next adjournment, Giri. Sir, please I beg you. I took a lot of effort to bring the witness till court, sir. Please sir, understand! Please, sir... Don't irritate me, Giri. Mr. Rajpal is a senior. Even the Supreme Court lawyers go to him and learn. What would you lose going to him and learn court rules and regulations? Will you lose anything? You should not have any egos, dear. Sir, rules and regulations are there to safeguard the justice. But not to bury the truth. Sir, by using all the loop holes in the law, Fraud lawyers like him are letting all the criminals loose. Damn! What did he say? Sir, that is... -What did he say? -I said "Fraud." How dare you call me fraud? I will and I already said it, didn't I? Be in your limits. You already saw my potential at your office, didn't you? I bashed up everyone. Hey, hell with the office! Show your power here if you have the guts. -Come, come let us fight... -Come! -Hey stop! -[indistinct voices] Mr Rajpal, maintain silence. -[chaos] -What is this? Hey, stop it. Hey! If you lay your hands on me, I swear I will punch you in the face. Will you hit me? Don't you believe? Let me show you then. Come on! Hey! Mind your language. I will slit your tongue, mind it! -You bloody rascal! -Sir, what is this? Sir, give me permission. I will kill right here and hoist the flag. I am a big goon in Chittore, sir. Hell with you, rascal! -[chaos] -Silence! Where is my gavel? Why should I fear, just because you are a senior? -What is this behaviour like a rogue? -Hey, stop him -Should I fear him? -Hey, I will kill you. -Come, let us fight. -Silence...! -You would have been dead by now! -Silence! -Leave me. -What is this? What do you think? Is this a court or a fish market? -Sir, please... -Hey! Leave me, sit down. Sorry, sir... Have you got only my court to fight? Go and fight on the streets. You know, it's not wrong to suspend you for a minimum of five years from the bar council for what you did. Sorry, sir. I should not have behaved so. I will make sure not to repeat it. Now you can go. Thank you, sir. Giri! You wait. What was that in the court? Will you punch in his face? Will you kill and hoist the flag? What is that language? I did not like at all. You just started the practice and why do you ruin your image? Why are you so angry? What is wrong with my anger, sir? I am a lawyer and not a clerk. One gets angry only when he is fighting for justice. Wow, well said. Justice is it? What happened to your senses when Albert Pinto gave a false witness? I had no sense then, sir and now I got my sense back. -Shouldn?t a man change? -Hell with the change! Look Giri, law may be blind but not the judge, right? You think I do not know what is happening out there? I can see everything. Then put all those laws aside and give a judgment as per what you see, sir. Total system would change. Court rules do not agree for that. Then what is the use of these courts, sir? Close them down. We will finalize it outside, won't we? Close down? Wow! You are talking too much! Do not show these Chittore goon qualities before me. Leave! Look, if you find any Goddess of justice there, offer a salute on my behalf too. Go! Rajpal, I believed you a lot. You are watching it, right? Situations are going out of hand. Once we think, everything if fine new problems are coming up. Diwan sir, everything would settle down in two to three days. I will take care. Oh I see! I came to know when that CD went into the hands of Sapthagiri, about how good are you taking care of. Sir, everything will be alright and I need some more time. Why should I give you some more time? On one hand we on are spending all our money, but there is no use. And what is his name? Pinto... Yes, we gave two crores to Pinto. And damn the bloody deal! What's the use? Sir, that Pinto did his job for the money you paid. Your money wasn't wasted. -Hey! -Hey! Mr Lawyer, we spent lakhs so that there shouldn't be any issue from them. And we are spending crores here. Hell with it! It's not about money. I am worried about the prestige of my family. Can you do this or not? Or should I hire some other lawyer? -Lawyers like Subramania Swamy -Sir... Hell with you! Look, at this age, I cannot see my grandson going to jail I am giving you one more chance. We should win in this case now. That's all! Hey, you are overacting these days. Do you imagine yourself a hero, just because you got popular on TV? Learn how to talk with seniors! Did you get it? Hey! How dare you mess with the seniors! Do remember! If you repeat this, you will be sent to those for whom you are fighting. Mr. Rajpal, please proceed. Your honor... Our Sapthagiri Sir showed a movie last time in CD and became a hero I agree that the car in that video is of my client They shot it on the night of the accident But, what is the relation between the footpath's truck accident and this car? But, both the accidents happened on the same day it's just a sheer coincidence. That is why all this confusion is created. Your honor, I would like to call my client's family driver. -What is his name? -Gopal Gopal -Sir... -Come, stand there Stand straight, hey this way. Stand straight man! Ok, Can you describe what happened that night? Sir, I dropped Rohit sir at birthday party and was returning home... What was the time then? Around 1 am. Ok, then? I was going fast as the road was empty As I couldn't control speed, I dashed the divider at a turning point. What did you do then? I called Yogi sir being tensed. He scolded me and asked to give a complaint in the Police station What happened in the Police station? At the Police station, they shot a video of the car for insurance purpose This is the real story behind that CD your honor Media people are repeatedly showing this video and are trying to trap my client into this case Sapthagiri sir is trying to become a hero I have a Police report copy and the insurance copy your honor I objection your honor... Wait, be right there Is he a guest at your home? That you direct him what to do? Sir, we are learning from you. Give us a chance too. Your honor, I should cross examine the witness Why not? Go ahead. Come on go ahead You do not worry Gopal Sir From how many years have you been driving? From 14 years Wow 14 years, in court language means a life time! So you have a great experience. How did that accident occur despite your years of experience? Hey... why do you look that way, look at me? Are you drunk? No sir, I raised the speed as road was empty at that hour Speed in the sense... around 60 to 70 kmph? That is a top model luxury car, it picks up 60 to 70 right in the first gear sir Oh, is it? What gear were you in? -I was in third gear on 120 speed. -Yes, note this point your honor Our dialogue king Rajpal sir could not teach him acting with expressions And thus he is simply caught shaking his head with dialogues they fed him. Your honor, that car has an automatic gear system and it does not have any gears. Then how did he go in third gear? I have already submitted all papers in regards with that car model. Automatic car? Yes, Mr. Rajpal Ok... Your honor, it is the first time that he is coming to the court and is thus feeling nervous. He is not but looks like you started to get nervous. Please your honor, give the next adjournment Why an adjournment sir, when he is making him lie right in front of our eyes? What man, are you lying? Do you know what happens if you lie in the court? Bend like a cock... Come on bend! I do not know how to bend sir I will show sir This is it sir You too bend like that, come on do it! Silence! Silence! Your honor, they are calling and threatening me to get away from this case. else they said they'd kill me. Here, they hit me too. These wounds are their gifts. What? Have they hit you? This is very serious matter your honor Poor fellow, look how hard they hit him. I thought you slipped and fell down in the bathroom. Your honor, we should not leave this matter here. Let us declare a holiday tomorrow for court and do a protest. Wow, what an acting sir! He deserves a Golden Nandi for his acting. He made his assistants thrash me and is now acting like innocent in the court. Me? I would never use such lame tricks on rookie like you. Hey, maybe someone did this to you for all the nuisance you create. Hey, agree to have got me thrashed when you did and prove you got guts of a man Guts of a man? Is it how you speak with a senior? How are your deeds then? -Sir, is this the way... -Stop... Are you fighting again? Will you not stop even after being said repeatedly? Look Sapthagiri, I am passing orders to provide you security. Ok? Sir, I do not need security. I just wanted to say what happened to me, that's all sir. No, I am definitely giving you the security. Because, if something happens to you... Mr Rajpal would be blamed for it. What do you say Mr. Rajpal? Yes or No? Yes... Exactly! Boss, atrocities of this Rajpal are increasing day by day! That idiot is nearing his end He is an idiot and thus hit from behind. Let him come face to face and attack, we would fry him up! Hey, I am getting a head ache I will bring a strong tea... Ok? -Boss, escape... -Hey, what happened? Oh no! Oh God, what is this? Who are you dude? You look like a twenty tired lorry? Why are you coming inside? Get out. -Is Sapthagiri sir here... -He is our boss Go, idiot Sir, this is bodyguard Baby appointed by the Government. Reporting for duty sir! I myself am trying hard to make ends meet and now another burden too? Hey, why do we need security? Send him away No sir, this is Government order and I have to obey it Hey, send him away You wait baby Where to send him sir?

That accident took place right before my eyes I carried the dead bodies with my own hands and put them into the tractor. Will you come to the court say the witness? -I will not come sir. -Why? Who would feed us if I roam around courts and Police station? Justice is a very costly thing for the poor in this country. Hey, none gets the justice just like that, one should have to fight for the justice. What if everyone thinks like you? Someone should come forward right? Yes, but we cannot. Why do you make us the scape goat sir? I told you all that I knew. But I will not come to give the witness If you fear so much to tell the truth, why did you call us so late in the night? Hey, you stay regretting this forever. and another accident takes place tomorrow Ten more beggars would die and you too will be one among them.

Hey, you made money out of the the dead bodies of farmers This sin will not be forgiven that easily, you will pay for it. I came to correct that mistake sir Do not kill us again to correct your mistake What is your relation to those who died? How much do you need to shut your mouth? Hey, we are not money minded, we are toiling farmers. We are not the city people who don't care when people die in front of their eyes We are true villagers who live like one family Hey, when a farming calf dies... we grieve and don't feel like eating anything that whole day. Will I be quiet when my own people face such an injustice? You country brute! Come on beat them If anyone comes out on the name of court and Police station, men will not be spared alive, and women will be assaulted. We died when some rich idiot dashed inebriated We died again for telling the dead farmers as beggars Above all when you to have made us believe so much and cheated... we died completely! Whole life of our farmers is a death... Hit by the electric wires, hanging ourselves, drinking pesticides... When were we alive? We were dead the moment we were born as farmers. Everyone has been killing us at every step Come on kill, keep killing us! Hey, though you keep killing us umpteen times, ...we will keep feeding you! Sir, I can understand your pain. I did one mistake unknowingly or knowingly I too am the son of a farmer. Send Hanuman Das once with me I will stand up to your confidence Hanuman Das will not come with you You have no courage to save. Still, we will not send him with a cheat like you What are we even talking to him? It is a danger to our village if he is here. Kick him out and drive him away Hey... Go away you idiot... Live cheating people! Go idiot "What happened, what has happened now?" "What is a life without up and downs?" "There is a way ahead and you have breath to go ahead" "Morning comes in the paths of darkness" "God is nowhere but he's the morale in you" "Do not let the light of hope blow off in you" "Courage is nothing but the justice in you" "Your aim will never lose" "Though you have no helping hand," "fight alone for all" A good guy like you should win "and the God will see to that you win" "What happened, what has happened now?" "What is a life without up and downs?" "What happened, what has happened now?" "What is a life without up and downs?" They asked to hit you to go into coma for six months But you should not die. How dude, how? Do you have to mess bigwig's cases? How will you go into coma, idiot? How should I hit that you go into coma? We will tie him a sack and beat him up bro! Hit him so hard that he doesn't get up. Only face broke when hit in the court and total body should be hurt hitting here Come on hit...

Will you not come without getting hurt? We gave you a bodyguard too right? Nothing sir, had a tiff in the village and we fought. -Who won? -Me sir Ok, come to the point Your honor, I wish to question SI Patnaik who investigated this case from first Ok, call hm Do not get tensed Mr.Rajpal, I gave the advance notice to witness in advance Sir You are the investigation officer of this case right? Yes Can you whole-heartedly say that you have investigated this whole case with complete loyalty? With complete loyalty and taking great trouble, I investigated every evidence. I swear on my conscience and say this. Can you say another matter taking the same promise? Yes, why not? Was it the beggars or the farmers who died that day in the accident? What, why are so tensed when I said farmers? I am not any tensed You are hiding something. You are lying. Speak out are they farmers or beggars? What farmers? They are beggars. No, they are farmers -No, beggars -Farmers -No, they are beggars! -Farmers -No, beggars -Farmers -Beggars.. -Beggars.. Farmers! There your honor, he is caught As we all thought, argued and understood it was not the beggars sleeping on the footpath who died in the accident but the farmers belonging to Tamsi village of Adilabad district If it comes out that they were farmers, the feared it would create a sensation in the nation and all the farmers would protest... they have preplanned it and said that they were beggars. and got the case closed your honour. Objection your honor, unfolded mischievous aspirants... They are deviating the case Where did these farmers come suddenly? I will tell you! Mr. Rajpal, let us first listen. You have some patience I meant... He now says farmers, and tomorrow soldiers... then students and then the aliens falling from space. Will you believe? Mr. Rajpal, we'll look into it later. You first be seated Sapthagiri, you continue -Mr. SI -Yes These are the names of those who died that day in the accident. Can you read out once to the court? Sir... Come on read out, case is very interesting Ramulu, Kishtappa, Saleem, Yesaiah, Saidulu, Hanuman Das... All of them come into my dreams and are doing great nuisance. That SI sir has not done the investigation properly. What do you say? You just said farmers and now saying dreams. Do one thing, make the ghosts coming into your dreams and make them say witness and it stands good I am doing the same now your honor I am going to bring one ghost from the six dead and make it give witness today Order, order! What are farmers and what nonsense? What is this fantasy in between? Not a nonsense your honor.Victim number six from the dead Mr. Hanuman Das is still alive But our Patnaik sir in the FIR has shown him as dead. He is that great My humble request to present the key person in this case and my witness Mr. Hanuman Das in court your honor What the hell? Objection your honor! How many times should I say you That a witness cannot be called without giving an advance notice? I know I should not call. But will they let him come at least to court once they get to know that I have a witness? Another story! This is a court proceeding and not your village settlement for anyone to come at their will Sir, this is the only chance for getting out the truths hidden in this case sir, just give me one chance sir Let even the justice be alive along with the law. Please sir Do not beg saying please sir, you first go and sit! You can tell the truth when you are asked to, go sit -Sir please sir -Hey, sit See sir, he is threatening right before you. Please sir, just one chance sir Mr. Rajpal, you just wait and sit. You be seated Mr. Sapthagiri, you present your witness Thank you sir Sir... None should speak. Sapthagiri, you bring him. But rules are rules, you cannot call a witness just like that. Come on, I am saying right? Sapthagiri, you bring the witness Sir, the rules do not permit it. You have to give an advance notice Mr. Rajpal... I too know the rules. I am giving the permission, right? No more discussion. As per the Supreme Court guidelines, you cannot call such a witness. How can you call such a witness? What? I said, how can you call such a witness? -How can I? -Yes How will you permit witness without giving an advance notice? I have a case law... Mr. Rajpal, this is my court and not any club of yours. Do you understand? Here, only I can and I am doing this. Mind it This is illegal. This is illegal. Mr. Rajpal, will you stop intervening? This is illegal. Look, you are committing contempt of court. This is bad Contempt of court? I am making an objection that something illegal is happening here and I am in contempt of court? When I am telling contempt of court, still you are arguing with me. This is not good for you. Sit down... Sit down I say I will not sit down Come on, I am ordering you go and sit down It is not the end of this I will not tolerate if you utter another word. I will approach bar council How dare you speak again, come on sit! I am going to make a big stink of this! Sit down I say! This cannot go on! Come on, sit down! Sit down I say, how many times should I say? This is my court! This is my court! And whatever I say, that is final. Go, sit down! In the 28 years of my legal career, no court has given such a weird ruling -I cannot... -Shut your mouth. This is Naramalli Sivaprasad, senior most Judge You tell me the rules? Where have you come from? You are posing like a big hero, sit! I am already sitting no, sir... -I am down. -Sit down -Mr. Sapthagiri... -Sir -Present the witness. -Thank you sir Move aside... Move aside All the best dude Sir, we got the main witness, Sapthagiri cannot win tomorrow. -Your name? -Hanuman Das sir Can you explain your relation with this case to the Court? I am sixth person who was thought to have died in this accident sir Can you explain what happened that night? Sir, we are from a small village Tamsi of Adilabad district Sir, we six that day came to Hyderabad to purchase seeds under subsidy. When the shopkeepers said there was no stock and they'd be available the next day ...we did not know where to go and what to do As we couldn't afford hotel room, we slept on the footpath alongside the road Sir, I head a loud noise that midnight, while I was asleep. When I woke up and saw, a boy got down from the car. He saw our guys in blood stains. I thought he would help us. But in fear he took out beer bottle from the car ...drank it and threw the bottle down. got into the car and drove it reverse in full speed over us. He again went ahead in the same speed. and I went unconscious sir When I opened the eyes and saw, was in the hospitals sir Then came a person to me... Hey, get up Do you remember the truck number which made your accident? Sir, the accident was not caused by a truck, but a car Just shut up! Accident was caused by a truck I remember very well sir Accident happened with a car sir. From there, SI took me to the dead bodies of my people in the mortuary -Are these your people? -Yes sir All these died as the truck has crashed No sir, all these died as the car crashed Not the car idiot, they died as the truck crashed. I fall at your feet and beg sir, leave me sir! I too wish to leave you, but, I get money killing you Sir, I have Rs30,000 brought to buy seeds and fertilizers. Please take these sir. Sir, those are the bangles I bought on loan, for my sister's wedding. Hey, go away! Later a constable got me boarded into a bus to Tamsi. Your honor, I request to give one chance for the main witness Hanuman Das to identify the main convict Rohit Objection your honor, I wish first to cross examine the witness Objection overruled. Mr. Rajpal, you sit down. Thank you, thank you your honor! Mr. Rohit, come dear... What is that cat walk, come fast! Hanuman Das, look at him thoroughly and tell. Is he the same person, who caused the accident that night with Toyota Fortuner? Sir, he is the one. [clock hour bell rings] Oh! It's lunch time. Let's meet after lunch. Your honor, I have a request. Mr. Rajpal... Can you give us another adjournment? Because, I have an important case today at the high court. Are you that busy? Then,why don't you send your junior here? No matter who stays and who doesn't... The Judgment in this case will be given today. That's all! Jyothi, it's the lunch break and final judgment will be given post lunch. In this hit and run case full of twists like a suspense thriller, as it came to know that the dead were not beggars but the farmers, this case is bagged more importance Jyothi. -Hey Ramaraj... -Sir Did we win the case sir? Is everyone happy, sir? -Where is that fellow? -He is inside sir -Bring him -Yes sir -Who is this fellow? -Hanumantha Rao of Tamsi sir I said Hanuman Das not Hanumantha Rao. Idiot, why didn't you say? Sir, when did they let me say? Get out! Come idiot! -Patnaik... -Sir... -Confirm me just three things... - Yes sir -Is his name correct? -Correct sir -Is he from Tamsi? -Yes sir -Is what all he said in court true? -True sir You let him go in greed of just Rs30,000, idiot! Sir... For the first time in my 28 years of career I had to bend my head in the court. Useless fellow, I gave you so many lakhs and would have given another lakh if asked Sir, I did a mistake You cannot get away with a sorry for the mistake you did now. Never show your face again! Idiot! Mr. Rajpal, please finish your arguments before the court gives the judgment. Thank you your honor! Firstly... for filing a PIL on the closed case... I thank Mr. Sapthagiri. After reopening, new truths, new proofs... and new witnesses came forward. But, none from these is true to prove my client as the convict. But your honor, I have to admit I am little worried. I am worried. Because, as I see the faces of all the people here... they look to have come to a confirmation that Rohit has done the accident. Not sure why... but I notice an eagerness in their eyes to send Rohit to jail May not be a conspiracy, but certainly an intent! But before we do that, let us examine certain facts. There is no clarity about what happened on the night of accident ...in the investigation report yet. There is some confusion. Some confusion! As per the FIR, accident was because of a truck But prosecution and this world says accident was because of Toyota Fortuner. As per the Police report, six were dead. But prosecution and media says it is five persons. Records clearly state that the dead are beggars. but prosecution says they are farmers. What is true and what should we believe, your honor? Similar to a thriller film, suddenly a dead body has come alive. We have a dead man who is walking in the court... and who has become the only eye witness in this case. Is this a kind of a joke? Your honor, as per the prima facie, I understand something. I feel the Police have not handled this case with fidelity. Especially this investigating officer Patnaik I request the court to take severe action on him The whole department being defamed because of such people. Court, case and investigation are mocked because of people like him. He made a fun of it. Your honor, my client should not be punished because of this Patnaik, which brings me to a very, very, very important question Is this court... willing to send my client to jail on the basis of this botched up investigation? Make no mistake. This is a botched up investigation with this law fumble and hilarious evidence If this happens... this will be the darkest hour in the history of judicial system of this country. Sorry... Sorry your honor! The dead were five members or six... I convey my deep condolences to them. My sympathies are with them. But your honor, there is a danger of death sleeping on the footpath beside the road It be a a car, truck, van or something that kills Your honor, if the affected is a victim of an accident ...the accused is a victim of the circumstances. Mistake is theirs who sleep on the road. This is the harsh reality. Harsh reality! The rest... Your honor! I leave it to your wisdom and your fine sense of judgment. Thank you your honor! Mr. Sapthagiri, your submission please. Thank you your honor. Your honor, for the first time I agree with Mr. Rajpal. True that there is a risk of death sleeping on the footpath. But, I wish to ask something to Mr. Rajpal. Not just him but I want to ask everyone here including you, your honour. Actually, who are those who sleep on the footpath? Why are they ruining the beauty of our beautiful city like this? Why are they dying crushing under the tires of lorries and cars? There is just one answer to that. They do not have a job. Neither have money nor a shelter. Lakhs of such are living on thousands of footpaths like this. If they sleep beside the roads, will they drink, drive cars and kill dashing them? Our nation, Government and rulers might not have given any rights to them But every citizen born in India will have an equal right in one aspect. That is the justice! You, me or anyone here cannot snatch that right from them. Our Indian constitution gives it to them Because the constitution of India is the Supreme Law of India. Inebriated and filthy rich young and energetic, innocent drinker Rohit has driven over five innocents sleeping on the road That was due to his carelessness but shows no signs of regret or remorse. But that looks like a joke to Mr Rajpal. Shall I tell you what the real joke is? Shall I? Mr. Rajpal knows that the dead are not beggars but farmers. He knows that accident was by car and not truck. But for the fees he took and to save his client who committed the crime changed the car into a truck in the records. He made the farmers into beggars. If you give six more months, he's say that it was an air plane not truck He would say the beggars as dogs. He can even prove this Hanuman Das as our Powerstar Pawan Kalyan. Because he is so efficient, he is so efficient You believe his words and give judgment. Why? Because what you see is the justice. Court needs evidences and they wouldn't be available You declare the convict as innocent and release him. This is the real joke, sir. Shall I laugh, shall I? Come on, all of you laugh! What did you say? 'Footpaths are not meant for sleeping'... True! At the same time, they aren't meant to drive the cars either right? Your honor, in India on an average 1214 accidents are taking place and 377 are dying. 137000 in 2013, 139000 in 2014, 146000 in 2015, 150000 in 2016 died... That means for every 4 minutes one person is dying in road accidents. More than half from these are dying in drink and drive cases. But is the government banning the liquor consumption? When the poor people agitate and question why they is no ban on liquor... They answer that 'Majority of our revenue is accumulated through liquor business'. The answer is that 'We'd sell, you have to drink and you have to die' It is our plight our Governments do not change their methods. And if our Rohit Diwan realizing his grave mistake and paid compensation to the dead farmers... and had surrendered voluntarily to the law, he would have remained a great person in the history. But he did not do so... He threatened the village and made the farmers into beggars He joined hands with a false lawyer, went on doing mistakes, spending crores in court and proved to the society that humanity is dead in humans and the evil mentality is grown! Sir... The criminal layers who are letting the criminal escape from the judiciary are the real criminals. People like him are the real criminals sir. Such people should be expelled from our courts. Winning is not just for mere sake of it. But should the win should be heartfelt and true to your own conscience. You said to have won more than 200 cases, isn't it? You did mistake defeating the justice all the 200 times. For what, for what? Is it for the money? After a point, money can just be hidden but of no use for anything, you know? If you had once stood for justice and made that win, you would have remained great forever in the history We should win to earn love, affection and respect from the people sir That is the real fulfillment for a human being. Haven't you read Bhagawadgita? Haven't you? Your honor, law says not to forgive even Prime Minister or the President when all the proofs and witnesses are in favour. If that is true, all the evidences and accused Rohit are right in front of you Take him and push him in the jail right away! Like a lesson to the public mocking and betting on our judiciary system. To gain confidence on courts and to prove power of Indian Judicial system Give such a judgement, with which the whole nation and the justice feels proud. Please, give one judgment your honor Our farmer is the only person who always gets cheated but never cheats, your honor We anyways could not do justice to such a farmer when he was alive Let us at least do justice after his death. Let us give the confidence that even a farmer too deserves to live in our country Give one judgment to say that we should let our farmers live. Give one such judgment... Thank you my Lord! [crowd applause] Silence! What a speech? It was a great speech. This is one of the best speeches in my career also Mr. Rajpal, look how clever is Sapthagiri? He is the right opponent for you. -Will you at least agree now or not? -Yes Now, coming to this case... We can see this case in two parts. First... Investigation done by the Police in this case... is full of flaws and corrupted! Thus I order Police department to suspend the investigating officer Mr. Patnaik and to get a complete investigation done Coming to the latter part. Manipulating the evidences. Mr. Rajpal, your client has done this crime. If not, why would he try to manipulate the evidences? Look, all of you know that Rohit is the murderer. I am the Judge and I too know. I cannot give the judgment as I know or as all of you know, right? Based on the evidences... on the first day when the case comes for the hearing... we get to know who the convict is. That is why, we keep waiting eagerly for the evidences to reach the court. Adjournments go on and on and the files pile up but... not a single paper comes to the court saying that this is the evidence. In such times, the accused is escaping and moving freely. I am not saying that this happens in all the cases. But in most of the cases it is happening. Coming to this case now... Rohit and his family and the great lawyer... made all believe that the farmers as beggars. This is very dreaded, mean and cheap. As quoted by Sapthagiri, this case is an example... to say that humanity is dead in humans and the evil nature has reached its peaks. Now the PIL number 48693, The trial state versus Rohit... In this case after examining the evidences thoroughly, As the convict Rohit in drunken state driving Toyota Fortuner car and dashed... was the reason for the death of five farmers. As per the IPC section 302 and 304A, I impose a life term jail punishment. I also order Rohit's family... to pay a compensation of 25 Lakhs each to the deceased's family they should also adopt Tamsi village of Adilabad district. Yes... Super! We won boss! We won! Sister, we won the case right? Your honor, this is bizarre! What? How do you give such a judgment? I am compelled to go to the high court Your judgment will be struck just in two minutes there. I will go to the high court You go anywhere. Go to high court, Supreme Court... go to the President or jump into a river. This is my court and my final judgment is this. Look, your client Rohit is going to the jail. This judgment should build a confidence in the farmers. Let us keep farmers alive and let us let them live. The detailed judgment follows soon Now the court is adjourned [crowd applause] Dad... -Come on move... -No.. Honey, do something! Sapthagiri, LLB Congratulations! I already told you that you will win for sure! You have won... No, you made us win! No, you made the justice win! You made the farmers live and proved you are son of a farmer. You are a great man!
