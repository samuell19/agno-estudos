I am ready. To Santa Claus, Brian Cullen. Regarding gifts. Dear Santa, with me goes well with you, I hope. This year I would like a Rocket Wheel. Sincerely, Brian Cullen. Very good of you. What is a Rocket Wheel? Oh, one of the coolest bikes in the world. He makes noise, the wheels give light ... -Okay. Go there but. Would you like anything else? -Oom Ralph brings the rest. That's true, so is he. We have to be extra kind this year for Uncle Ralph. Because Aunt Margaret? -Indeed. Christmas can be for when you've lost someone. But let's make the best Christmas of all time. What is this? Some boys at school said that Santa did not exist. So I wrote some questions. -As? How can he do all that in one night, all over the world? There are time differences between the markets, so that helps. If there's Christmas, it's not in Australia. So he has an extra night. And he has a lot of branches ... ..and he has updated its fixed distribution software. Courier companies do that every day anyway? You know what I do? I look at it and come back tomorrow. Now go to sleep, bolleboosje. Do your eyes closed. Sleep tight. Goodnight. I wish that Christmas was over. start self-diagnosis. I WowWee Robotics model RSV2. Bought for my nephew, but I love him. He can drive a police car. I am, Benny. Look, now he's running. Nice. We have a surprise for you. -I'm coming. He lust down a beer. Behave yourself. Here I am. Look at that. What are you all doing here? Nice to have you here, Marcia. Well, what's going on? Congrats. We give you this picture because you're retired. What do you think about it? Thank you. It's nice to hang on the wall, but I'd rather be on the street. Ralph, it's an honor. I know, but I let these young guys are still behind me. I will also be something to show you. That you do not believe. Come Benny, you really do not believe. Give up. -What? Do you have a weapon? Not required for such an old man. -Oh no? Are you crazy? Listen carefully. If you budge, I crush your windpipe. What did you learn tonight? You never have to rob someone in a bar full of policemen. When my robot even slightly damaged, I tear you to pieces. Do you have handcuffs on you? -Yes, i have that. Hit him in cuffs. I'm exhausted. -I will. Come on, lie on your stomach. Note its name, and the Agreed Minutes on. Attempted robbery. This is the case of Hybrid Micro-Tech, and there is a surprise in your office. Mr. Barnes flowers. It says: Compliments to the Foster Klus. Great, that's better than I thought. -I know. Barnes? Beautiful. Do you know what that means? Champagne was too expensive? -Onderdirecteur. This is my list? -The wishlist Brian. It is such a treasure. Children are greedy, but he wants only one thing. What then? -A Rocket Wheel. You're kidding, right? -How so? Have not you seen? That you have not heard about. You analyze companies. Yes, but no bicycle company. You can only get if you go to China. Do not panic. Drop everything and find one of them on the internet. I will. -And further? Your mother emailed that they do not get Christmas. They had a free home in the Caribbean. -They should come. And then Brian? She was Thanksgiving. -The parents of Richard come. They must make turkey. I can not do that. -Kalkoen make is dead simple. No, the first few times he's terribly dry and get it away. That does not really help. I'm off to the parents of Richard and they can not all me. What should I? Many make gravy? I care for a Rocket Wheel. Everything will be fine. And turkey recipes. -I will do. You are great. Come for that memorable Christmas at Winsley's ... ..where diamonds are still the best friend of a woman. What do you think? It will be broadcast tomorrow. Honestly? You should not make your own spots. I know, but sales increased by 32%. People want to see that bumbling. Do you want to do something for me? You know just about everyone. How can I get on one of those? I'll call some people, but why did you wait so long? I knew that it was such hype. -You analyzes companies. I know that. If that is still once said to me ... Really, I'm crazy for the whole Christmas. I must do some shopping, my cookies were dirty, the house is bare ... ..and now also appears that my mother does not. My parents wanted to meet her. -I know that. They will have to make do with Uncle Ralph. What do you mean? I do not know well, he's pretty crass him. He's super nice. He made his weapons clean the room if you brought a friend. He has become more relaxed. Great, you're amazing. I have the truck, the ball, the robot, this and this to Brian. For Jen, I have nothing. I do not like buy gifts for girls. Everyone should be in the office at 10:00. Say but soon. I'm going now. -Good morning, Jennifer. Good morning, Rita. -I saw you not still hanging lights. You would not have any dark house? We hang the whole street is full. Simple, just white lights. Beautiful. I have the company does already called. Who did she do to you? My husband, of course. -Of course. We're still over there. My husband, of course. Just go behind my car, if you dare. LARGEST CHRISTMAS bestseller He's not for sale. That remains. -Why? It's bait and switch. He dishing inwards. They buy something else if I order a Rocket Wheel, January. I buy him, but take him until Christmas Eve. I do not know. Look, it goes like this. After the 25th, there is no question anymore. I buy it, but it lures customers with. 24 I pick him up and making profits. We have both something. We close at 12:00 noon. I'll be there at 11:59 pm. Thank you. Clever people think alike. I just called you. Did you talk to Mom? What should I do with the turkey? Who's going to Christmas' t beach? She's my sister, I love her, but she's really crazy. You bet, and I hoped she would ride with you. It's a long way. That's why I fly. -What? There you have to hate. If you've flown for the last time? Toen was Nixon president. I want a ride from the airport to your home. Put me on the list. You insist. I send the packets on ahead, then I have little luggage. You did not unpacked too brave, huh? -That would like to know, huh? You're incorrigible. Hey, I'm here, you know. Miss, I do not see Chicago. Can you help me? No I can not. And you paid for? What is this? Listen, I do not change. I do not buy brochure and I will not join your sect, so leave me alone. I wanted to ask if I could help you. you often fly? Yes very often. I see Chicago is not listed. That says nothing. May I see your ticket again? 1274 Chicago, the flight I got. Which line should I stand? Unfortunately, it's that long there. I have not yet checked. I dozed off. Morgan Derby. -Ralph Kendall, aangenaam. What do we do now? -I know how we get beyond that line. But it's a little unfair. -Continue. Come with me. Come with me. Miss, we have a problem. -You and a million other people. Your bagageman drove against my uncle. -And? And? That's called negligence. -I can do nothing for you. We can make it easy or difficult. It's on video, we'll sue you and I have the names of twelve witnesses. When they see those pictures ... -What is the easy way? You go back and check us in. An upgrade would be nice. All right then. Caution. Here it is. I sit by the window. Why complain about everyone so fly? It's beautiful. Do not get used to it. On the way you sit in the back. Well, Ralph, what do you want for breakfast? There is steak with egg Spanish omelet. No, I'm good. We fly first class, everything is free. Is that a joke? -No not at all. Good morning, would you like a drink? -What do you have? Coffee, tea, beer, champagne. -Free? I start with beer, go straight to finish with champagne and steak with egg. The same for me. -Can I take your coat? I get it back? Just kidding. Christmas is complete without turkey with trimmings. Nothing so much points to Christmas as the smell of turkey that comes out of the oven. Well, now say how I'm supposed to prepare. Before you begin, you need to preheat the oven. First turn it 150 degrees. Then at 200 degrees. Thereafter, at 230. What are you thinking? Everyone loves juicy turkey, so pack it in a thick layer film. Take half thick film. -The basis of the filling is breadcrumbs. Take croutons for a nice filling. -Selderie is nice. Fresh apples make something sweet. The choice of the right casserole is very important. Olive oil. -Butter. Shrimps. Ganbei-. Garlic. -Rozemarijn. You start packing ... -Never use aluminum foil. This is a major disaster. Lets see. When I worked in Ireland on a farm. Spain, Greece, Paris. What did you do in Paris? -Have a look. English taught. worked as a waiter, stood behind the bar, fish cleaned. What written and staged Waiting for Godot. I do not want to type out your resume. That's 60 pages long. That changed a few weeks back. -How so? When I was 30. -There I want to hear about. I have been since my studies to roam. It's time to settle down somewhere, so I go to Denver. What is there? -An old friend. I want to open a restaurant with her. I see you still ask: Excuse me, you want to see the menu? I'm in the kitchen. Put even cook that resume. Did you cook? -Absolutely. How do you prepare a turkey? You have not eaten turkey as long as you have not eaten mine. Other question. What cranberry sauce? For you? Canned. -With you I can talk. I hate those hard bits. I want a smooth sauce. I thought so. Come on Brian, we go. Well done. It's too big, ma. No, that hook is just too small. I'll get a bigger one. I put it on the list. She is beautiful. -It is more a daughter than a niece. Her father died when she was young. And her mother? -My sister. A successful lawyer, but crazy. She is often on the road, so often Jenny lived with us. We did not have children. -Is she a single parent? She met someone. I saw him once. He is nice. Even among us, he's boring. Some doorknobs are interesting. But he is very successful and wears shoes of $ 800. Are you serious? In my 38 years as a police officer I learned the following: People with shoes of $ 800 are unreliable. I will remember it. Calm down, we landed. We are so. -It looks that way out. Excuse me. I should have such a hot towel? I like very much. It calms me down. When is the next flight to Denver? That's hard to say. Denver is snowed. Sorry. Look out, be careful. Are you OK? He went to the toilet, Jen. Then you must be Brian. How is it going? -Good. Sorry, but we know each other? Hey beautiful. -Oom Ralph. Swallow your pills that beauty still? You come over here. Go ahead, naughty or nice? -Sweet. Here's a tenner. Verbras not all in one pub. And? -It is not in there. How awful. -It's all right. I sleep a few nights here. Then you learn the best guards. Nice to meet you. -Thank you for everything. Merry Christmas. And who is that? That's a very good friend of mine. Really? A very good friend? -I want some questions. He could spend a night with you? His flight was canceled. This is very annoying, but no. -It's just for one night. It's Christmas. -I get no stranger in the house. Later it is crazy. -I was 30 years agent. I see that right? I smelled him. It's good. -What? I just snorted at him. It is a good guy. No. A hotel perhaps? -He has no intention rotcent. Even better, a wanderer. He's cook. It's just a bit of a hippie. -Is he cook? You know what his specialty? Turkey. A delicious turkey with us unique. -That's enough. Without him, I was still searching my queue at the airport. Through him I flew first class. He can not sleep on the hard floor. One night only. -Well then, one. Come on, you're in. Really, it is great. Where do we have to go? This way? This is Morgan, this is Jennifer. You have years traveling through Europe? -That's right. Is your lost luggage at the airport? No, this is it. You got done with a few years? I often sit in laundromats. Skip Want to see? -Yes of course. Who is Skip? You'll see. There was someone who wanted to hang your lights. I said you wanted. It's only been three days. You do not ... -The only dark house with Christmas. Look. -For me? Thank you. How is that you? No idea. My uncle found him at the airport. Thank you for your gift. It is a red-eared turtle. -You room is really neat. Organization saves time. There is little say against it. He called Skip. -He looks familiar. I worked at a nursery. -Not. Really. On a small island near the coast of Australia. We grew especially starfish, but we also had turtles. You can recognize them by the drawing. I think he called Harry. Did you see that? Wait a second. There he is. It's really Harry. How likely is it that you continue to come together thousands of kilometers? Fat ring. -Do you know that the stone is made? Molten lava. In Alaska erupted from a volcano. I had a week on the hillside camp. Harry anyway. Look. I'm the man of the lights. -Good. How much? Then I have to measure it first. -Honderd dollar. You would not be the only dark house. If you say that one more time, it's 75. Agreement? Good, then I open the garage. Sorry I let you sleep on the floor, but I'm older than you. No problem. Come here, Ralph. Look at that. He seems unreliable me. -Well spotted. we do research? -Absolutely. we bother? Boys, this is not what you think. I think this is what we think? -I think absolutely. So yes. You stay here. I'm calling the police. My head. What is going on? What is it? -That guy robbed the whole neighborhood. He was a car thief. Morgan had him. You must be agent. Was he steal? That's an old trick. You can ask the next time references? Could not you wait until he had hung the lights, as community service? It's not that bad. -I'm the only dark house. My neighbor is the Christmas Nazi. Everything must be white. I hang them on. That ring is too big. No, the hook is too small. -He weighs 15 kilograms. You have a gun and not need duct tape. I -Mag the wreath? Close the door. -Of course. With me. I wanted to know if you are home. -Yes. How so? I wanted to come here. Now? -Straks. I want to discuss something with you. I'm quite busy. -I will not be long. See you later. Your cousin seems very smart. -Ivy League, MBA, and so on. Why let some guy in her garage? -In cases she is Einstein. When it comes to real life, she's dumber than a hairball. You should have seen her husband. -Tell. It was a jerk. He left a month after the birth of Brian. Class. Incredibly. And now her friend, the jeweler ... I know. Expensive shoes. The prince of the shiny shoes. She's actually always been a funny girl. She always made lists. -What lists? Barbie clothes, what I'll do next year and 57 years. Lean once forward. What are you getting up to? -I hang the lights on. I'm sorry, I thought ... Are you OK? -Yes fine. Is she naked? I told you she was funny? Richard comes along. So this may be a little strange. Why? He still belongs to me? I know, but I do not ... Oh, you mean he's jealous. No, I just do not need to explain exactly how it ... Do you want to do something for me? keep him out? I can do that. -Can? I will do that. You're so nice. How is it going? -Good. With you? Uncle Ralph you know already. Nice to see you. -Insgelijks. That is a long time ago. Those are beautiful shoes, say. -Thank you. How was your flight? Nice, I flew first class. They have those free hot cloths. Yes, that's why ... Sorry, I must record here. If he can not fast, but you absolve him. He will be on the phone all your life, really. Uncle Ralph, now be nice. I want to January 1 to open a new store. This is beneficial for the tax. Do you miss your life as an agent? Not really, I miss just a little bribery. Bribery? -The little work. Gambling, especially speeding, things like that. Really? Was always good? -It's a joke, right? Yes, I'm a joker ... ..but I still want to say that I have great respect for those shoes. Thanks again. -You're welcome. For this I came. The gift for Brian. -Tjonge, an envelope. My God, a gift of $ 500. Toy World, which is his favorite, huh? If not, then ... No, it's very generous and thoughtful, but you just could give a toy. I knew nothing, so a gift certificate seemed better. Do not mind me, I'll get some coffee. -I point to the lampjesman be a way. Children like to play on Christmas morning with something. Do you understand? I let my assistant or buy anything. Say Jen, your milk supply is low. It's fine, really. He will be pleased. I must record here. I do not care what he says to me. I'm not joking. All he has to run, he leaves early tomorrow. Drop it. We have to put her together. A nepboom. Of silver. -There are also ugly things with gold. Have you never had a real one? -Which is out, says Mom. That's the purpose. Look, Brian. I went looking for a child hours with my grandfather in the forest ... ..tot we saw the perfect tree. The fresh snow and the smell of pine needles. That was beautiful. -Well, they sell them later. Then we look away. Come on, tell me, which one of you will soon be very juicy? Well, I'll encounter here. Frozen turkey? Terrible, huh? Who put it on the table for his family? Absolutely. Free range. I believe in corridor six. Exactly. I hope you choke on your lawyer. CHRISTMAS TREES FOR SALE It's not really a pristine forest. -Better than nepboom. That belongs in Las Vegas. -Did you as a child never felled a tree? This person is from Brooklyn. -I found him. Let's see then. Yes that is him. You saw that correctly. Let me pay. It's my family. -It's my idea. A bum does not have to be broke. -For this one time then. Thank you, Morgan. owe nothing, boy. This is him. Where is the cash register? We're going to pay. Look, Morgan lunch prepared. Chic enough, tuna steak with vegetables. Before you is a sign ready. -I do not really draw. What is that smell? -That the tree should be. It is a real, needles and sap. Where's my tree? Mom, you see the tree? Nice huh? I have chosen him and Morgan paid him. I think the tree very pretty. But of course I had a tree. Yes, an ugly silver with gold junk. -It was a train wreck. Horrible. -They get used to it. This is really wonderful. SEE YOU IN DENVER? I knocked, but you were ... I just wanted to give you some towels. I have some of your own. -Yes I see. Otherwise it would be embarrassing. Yeah, I can imagine that ... I do not imagine it, but I'll just bring back the towels. Can you help me? Belt's father Brian nor Christmas? That chance is very small. -What an asshole, man. Have you never made mistakes with relationships? Constant, but I've never been married. Well, have you done. Tell me about the friend with whom you want to open a shop in Denver. It's just a friend. -What is her name? Morning Mist. Morning Mist? You are kidding me. She can not help it, her parents are ... -Gek? I also do not say anything about Richard? -What can you say about him? He's smart, charming and very personable. Maybe it's something for me. He is very successful and orderly. That always stirs considerable passion. -Stop it. If you open his closet, hanging all the shirts on color, huh? I knew that could not be otherwise. we will buy that turkey? The cold front in the Rockies gives travelers two days headaches. Joanne Dave Rochereau is in Denver. It snows heavily here yet. The airport is open again tomorrow at the earliest. Stranded travelers face a long night. I get it already cold when I think about it. -Thank you, keep yourself warm. What a great shop. -I told you so? How did you know that? I live here and did not know him. I like reading about food. Oh, that restaurant or Dust Morning Dew. Sorry, but she's got a funny name. -It's all right. Tell me about the location. Is there pressure? You can easily park? I have no location yet. -Not? What is the kitchen? I do not know yet. Not? Do you have enough start-up capital? He is a little forward. Avoid Behavior. The restaurant is ... more -Droegen women but a cap. Some women may have a cap, others not, but you do. Thank you, let's go back to your business. -If you want per se. It all sounds rather vague. -You know what? My whole life is vague. You'd rather not talk about it, huh? I thought so. Further on is a great bakery. We have a turkey. -Absolutely. Do you read them? I know who they are. Come here. -I come, Uncle Ralph. What is it? Look at that. Denver is still snowbound. Suppose not going his plane tomorrow. One night, we said. -Put him on Christmas Eve you like? If you just do not think. Just go. -I am watching you. You're mean. Hi Jen, can I show you something? The red. Indeed. -I brought white. That's very nice, but not yet. It is a Portuguese tradition ... ..gebaseerd on the legend of one red candle, but you probably already knew. It brings happiness. We have still a lie, so if you want it ... Merry Christmas. The legend of one red candle does not exist, right? Which will exist somewhere. But you have deliberately screwed him. And you know they're there all mesjokke of will. That idea I had, yes. Thank you. -You're welcome. That's a lot for a Christmas room. I was wondering how long it would last. I've heard worse. What you have many friends. You know those people really all? Of course. Who is Edmond Coll? -That is... Edmond is ... It's a business relationship. You would not know him if he would come now. What are you doing? -I make it easier. Bernard Coletti. -Go now sleep on the couch. Who is that? He is on the list. I got a card from him. You've thrown away. What do you think he's doing with yours? You peigert yourself, but for what? I am going to bed. It's not my business. -Bingo. But you're doing it all wrong. Remember when you were a child? You looked forward all year. It was not just about the gifts. It went mainly to ... ..that everyone was just a bit nicer. All the strange habits much betekenden. Now everyone exaggerates and are stressed and irritated. I hear every year someone say, I'll be glad when Christmas is over. For me, December 26 the saddest day of the year. Was that it? It must be wonderful to have any responsibilities. To get from country to country and from job to job to. Frankly I envy that to some extent. But I have to be above a son and I have a house. And I'm exaggerating it a bit, but that's my business. I do not want a speech from you at 01.30 am what I am doing wrong. You are absolutely right. That was unnecessary and rude. Without you I now lay on the ground at the airport. Sorry. Really. Goodnight. What is it? Are you OK? I sat on your nutcracker. Just right. But you must be careful. That's what happens when you buy it frozen. Richard, she can not even prepare turkey. My parents will be very disappointed. You've ruined Christmas, Jennifer. I take back all the gifts. What smells good. -Morgan bakes pancakes. You do not know what you taste. -The secret: The batter a little lumpy leave, otherwise it will be too slippery. Eggs are low. Yummy. I can also make for you, though. What's so funny? Jen, you wanted to see it again? Here it is. -What's the weather like in Denver? Wait, that stupid joke she made all yesterday. And she had the same dress to match. What are you doing? I think its delicious turkey. -I can do make my own rotkalkoen. Look, it's not a bad guy ... ..but this Christmas is very important to me. Then comes the bad that staying a complete stranger to me. Good news for people in Denver. The airport is open again. These travelers have been stuck here for two days. Say, could I lift to the airport? Should he really go? Yes, he is expected in Denver. He would like for them at Christmas. -Tell, Brian. It was nice meeting you. -I thought so too. Sorry I have no gift for you. -Which tree is cool. Beautiful. Let your mother pack with him. Then you see some green. Well, dude. Take care, good trip. -Thanks for everything. What is it? -Nothing, I just look. Listen, you heat the oven to 230 degrees. Okay, 230 degrees. -And then... Then you wrap the bird in foil. I get it. Are you OK? M'n paspoort. I can not find my passport. There is not enough time. This is the last flight. Without identification, do not board. Do not have a drivers license? -When I was 18. What's your home address? -That is not fixed yet. He bakes pancakes. Does that help? -Not really. It is fixed at home. Come with me. Help me please. It's Christmas Eve. I need to get him out of the house. Why? Unbelieveable. Sorry about my passport. It must have fallen out of my jacket. -I have a lot to do today. I have yet to wrap the gifts. Brian bike. I was there for 12:00. Calm down. -Are you serious? That's all he asked. He believes though not in Santa Claus. If he does not Rocket Wheel ... What a klutz. We'll make sure he gets it. -How? That store is truly shut. It's Christmas morning and it's not even ... I promise you he will get that bike. You will not break, huh? That's an option. But first, let's try that. EMERGENCY CALL CHET: 555-0178 In case of emergency. This is clearly an emergency. What is the number? Chet Day, Jennifer. I'll pick up the bike. Yes? I'm sorry for you. -How so? I paid for. Too bad. -It's Christmas. You know what? I hate Christmas. I'll be glad when it's over. He hung up. This is the only thing he wanted. Hide in the alley across the street. -What? Why? There is a cheap alarm. I've ever installed. Was that before or after the turtle nursery? Just go. -I do not go to jail on Christmas Eve. Would you like to bike or not? What are you up to? -Go now but. Quick, go through. Run through. Go out of my way. That is, unless you want to climb up on me. Let it out of your head. And what do we do now? -To wait. It can not be long. This I totally planned today. Can you not finish your list? What now? Just wait. That's you in a few years. I have no tattoo. You know how many restaurants fail within 1,5 years? Want to discuss this in the trash? That symbolism goes very far. I think you have no idea where you embark in yourself. Do-how hot she experience? That kind of experience I mean. I know Denver, but the start-up costs ... It will be fine. -What do you say? Beautiful business. I'm not going to ruin your dreams. Sorry. I hope that you will achieve them, really. But I analyze companies and I'm good at. I would not recommend your restaurant to investors. Come quick. Not so fast. Cars ice heels. Now that you're there, please do give us the bike. I could have known. Forget it. Open the door and give us that bike. Then you can go. Never mind, Morgan. You and I, in that alley. If I win, we get the bike, otherwise keep your bike and money. Fine. -Beautiful. It's your money again. Unbelieveable. Well, come on. Come on. -Are you ready for it? Is this really necessary? -Let me just a moment. Do you have a black belt or something? -That you will notice soon enough. Some respect please. That how it's supposed to be. -Fine. Look. I had to. He is much broader. Quick, get out. That was incredible. Shall we hide him in the garage? -Yes fine. I just wanted to thank you. I would have been helpless. And although definitely not on my list was for today ... I ..vond fun. This is the first time I see you laugh. That's not true, I do laugh, often. You find me just a bit of an unfortunate time. Well, but what is a happy moment? 26 december. I know that is the day that you like least. I think I'm kind of Scrooge. -No hear that you're not. You just learn to celebrate Christmas. I put it in the garage. He's not there yet, huh? -Do you have him? Know your passport? You stole it. -Beschuldig your uncle? Yes, and the words roll so my mouth out. -Have you testify? What are you doing? What are you up to? Morgan seemed like a good match for you, and I know he really likes. We are not in the first year. -Listen here, Jenny. You're always one, what can I say ... -Pas on. ..a been conservative woman, right? And Richard is a safe bet. Maybe it's time to take a risk sometime. This is crazy. It's an alien. Richard is a wonderful man. He is kind, strong, stable, and you can rely on him. That sounds like a bookcase. I'm not going to mess up. Mr. Derby leaving tomorrow, before the parents come from Richard. No more games. Promise? -I promise. Can I ask you something? We sit on Christmas Eve. Would you wear your Christmas? Remember those? Of course. Aunt Margaret let me keep them. -I have made a picture. And then you could gain her makeup, huh? I think every day to her. -Me too. Especially at this time of year. I only need to see a Christmas decoration or hear a Christmas song ... ..and the memories come back, by the millions. Things that I thought to be forgotten. 35 Christmas time. Would you they really do not own? Aunt Margaret would be happy if they knew you had. They would also allow me a little clumsy. Rare. I'm going to check it out. -They are you really beautiful. they are good to me? -Lieve sky, you look beautiful. Would you do me a favor? Want to give Richard a chance? It is a good guy. Agreed. I just wish he was a little looser. -I heard. Watch out, you will soon fall even death. I'll hold him. Are you OK? You know what? I weigh more than you. I'll hold him? What do you usually do on Christmas Eve? The last errands, mostly. It's not too late, I can bake cookies. There are many offers now. I'm going out tonight. Really? I have a little dinner. Who gives a dinner on Christmas Eve? -The parents of Richard. What does that mean? -Nothing, just a standard response. It's a dinner party with family and friends a few things. That sounds nice. What do you think about it? How does it look? It looks great. Beautiful. Well, I shall just go change clothes. Enjoy it. -I will do that. How do I look? You look beautiful. You too. Not pretty, but the male equivalent. You look really good. It's Christmas Eve, so I felt I had to get dressed properly. It's a long time since I had a lovely Christmas. I had forgotten how much fun it can be a family. I just wanted to thank you. No, I should be thanking you. You're not as annoying as I thought. Yes, people must like me. I wish you would not have gone. You know how it is. These are the plans. Of course, the plan. I'll go to my room. No, this is my house and you're a guest. I am coming. Hey. Your crown fell off. -Put him down there. You look beautiful. Day, I'm not late. Were not you that guy from the lights? -At that time, yes. No, I'm just a friend of the family. We have to go. He's moved in with you? It's a friend of my uncle. What else could I? Is it tomorrow? That my parents would find strange. He's waiting for a flight. If he is there, your parents must simply accept. Mother father. -Day, treasures. I look forward to the turkey tomorrow. -Yes, me too. You look beautiful. -Thank you. You too. Did you earrings Richard? No, these are ... They are very retro, huh? Well, he can at least do something. Shall we drink? I call. -Too bad for you. Two eights. Well, I've farmers and threes. -Full house. I'll again get a game. What are you still watching the whole time? I want to believe the best in Santa Claus, but that is not so easy. He still comes through the chimney? -Klopt. Suppose that the fire is on. Before that he was sitting a fire extinguisher on the side of his sled. Older boys at school said he did not exist. I want to believe in him, but I do not really credible. Would you do me a favor? Do something more relaxed. It's Christmas Eve, the most fun night of the year. Right. You know what? You brush your teeth, you pull pajamas and then go do something else. look for Rudolph? -Good idea. I have a red nose when you come back down. He is very serious, huh? -Just like his mother. We'll keep him once fooled? -Continue. I'm going outside. And so it went. -Another Christmas story? Real or fantasy? -Really. Yes, I know something. I often arrested a man named Chichi Barelli. He dressed up as elves, oddly enough, and he often robbed harvesters. It was a fat man, a fat elf, really. He ran every time to the same subway station ... ..the stairs at that point shoes, he stepped into the subway and the door closed. What was that? I think he is. If he thinks you're not sleeping, he skips this house. What was that? That's a very big elf. Go on your side, quickly. Still, I think he is. Turn around and go to sleep. Do not get out of bed. I have to know what you get tomorrow. I'm coming. Good grief. Come on. -Trapte he in? With both legs. How is it going? -Not too good. I get as a compress. Give me some of your lawyer. -Consider it done. Richard may open new stores from me, but the location is crucial. When we decided to expand, we forgot a lot of intangibles. Are you OK? And with you? I will give him a moment silence. Ladies and gentlemen, I would just may need your attention? Sorry I interrupted your story, Dad. Now we are here as family and friends together, I want to tell you something. Will you marry me? Brian already asleep? -More or less. Otherwise look. I will call you tomorrow. Morgan, can I talk to you? Jen and I are now engaged. Congratulations. I do not want to be rude, but we will celebrate tomorrow. It would be weird if you're still around. I offer you a hotel of your choice at the airport until you leave. I pay. As a Christmas present. May I discuss it here with Jen? Then there was a thump on the roof. And when we heard bells. Bells, bells for what? How they sounded then? Morgan, I just tell ... Yeah, I do not want to disturb you. I just wanted to say goodnight. -Good night, until tomorrow. You have to give me away. On Christmas Eve there are enough rooms. No problem, I can deduct it. Have all your stuff? This is all. Mom, wake up, it's Christmas. Rise. I've been stood up. Merry Christmas. He has given m. Santa has given the Rocket Wheel. Of course. He is Santa Claus. He's awfully cool. I do not smell coffee, Morgan. What's all this noise on Christmas morning? Merry Christmas. -You also merry Christmas. Where's Morgan? He is not above. He is gone. He has left a ring and this. Here you grow into. Merry Christmas, Morgan. Come here. That's very sweet of him, huh? Do not look so glum. Come here. It's nice of him to leave it behind, huh? What is more important: Who leaves also presents behind? Santa. -Let them open. Good idea. What gift first? Passengers for Flight 117 to Denver, will you please go to gate 11b? Is not that rude? He just left. No greeting, no thank you, nothing. He has the classic Peter pan syndrome. Good thing he's gone. Brian found it very exciting that Santa was there, huh? He thought he heard something on the roof. He heard Morgan on the roof. -Was that Morgan? Those inconsiderate, irresponsible boy almost fell to pieces from your roof ... ..to convince your son that Santa exists. So speak no evil about him where I'm at. Boy, these are beautiful. Merry Christmas. -How is it going? Merry Christmas. My parents, Winnie and Stephen. -Oom Ralph. This is Brian. The turkey smells delicious. Brian, in my pocket is a gift. I hope you like it. This is for you. No, that is not for you, Jen. My name on it, sneak. Would you excuse us? -Brian go Skippy but equally carry. Uncle Ralph, he called Skip. Yeah, those too. Go quickly. Come in, sit down. Make yourself at home. I can explain. -You better. Try explaining what this is. It did not seem appropriate that Morgan ... -Gepast? He did what? write a nice thank-you note? Because that's it. Would you like to read? No, I'll never look into your post. No, but you steal him. This is totally inappropriate. Like it not childish? Richard jeweler. I know a lot of jewelers, because my neighborhood was in Brooklyn. The street was full of them, and they were all thieves. I'm not saying your son is a thief ... ..but if you yawned at those guys, they stole your fillings. I decide who's staying in my house. -Of course. What was all that crap last night? -What do you mean? How can you ask me to marry where strangers are? I do not know them. It seemed fun. They often do it in baseball. In baseball? They are idiots. Christmas Eve should be the best night of the year. I've never been so bored. Like father, like son, so. You also likes shiny shoes. This is important in the business world, I think. Mom, Dad, the plans changed, we're leaving. What is going on? Wait a second. You're forgetting something. Are you coming? And then the turkey? It's Christmas. I do not want Chinese food. What have I done? I make it out with Richard to someone who is not even. You can take in life but the best risks. So get your currant and go find him. What should I do? Christmas go to the airport ... ..in the hope that I might walk him bump? That sounds good. That's crazy. It is indeed. So do it. Really? Right now? -Just do it. Come here. The oven is adjusted. The turkey should be at 13.15 hours. You can not get there. -Do not touch. Such Christmas I hold now. Passengers for Flight 117 to Denver, will begin boarding at gate 11b. You are not coming in without a boarding pass. I do not want in an airplane, I want someone to take out. Wait, this is the same man as yesterday, you wanted out of your home? I know. Really, I know. It's really all very strange. I met him 48 minutes ago, and at first I was awfully fond of him. He is cute. My son like him, my uncle loves him. My uncle nobody likes. He is funny, can cook and gave my neighbor the fat, which was good. He is gorgeous. The funny thing is that I did not like Christmas. I found nothing as a child, but he has made ... ..that it is something special. He knows how to celebrate Christmas. I do not even know why I'm crying. I've never done anything crazy, but I had to take the risk. This is my only chance, because if I do this ... I ..zie it may never. But I'd like. You can check it here? He called Morgan Derby, he flies to Denver. It is her. She's talking about me. I have to go. According to the data they already boarded. Really? Can I please have a very small piece, Uncle Ralph? I would like to, but then they'll kill us. She did good, huh? It looks delicious. She found him. Now it's only Christmas.
