This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. Olivia, where are you? We're late for the Christmas Eve gala. You still need to get dressed. I am dressed, Mom. Get down here. Okay. Oh no. I will be glad when you grow out of this phase. Please. Go ahead. So? The treatment worked. I told you. The trees are going to be just fine. I don't know how to thank you. No one else could figure out what was going on. Guess that's why they call you the Christmas Tree Whisperer. Uh, yeah, I'm an evergreen specialist. They don't become Christmas trees until someone decorates them. To be honest, I don't think they need to get all gussied up. I think they're perfect just the way they are. Thank you very much. Mr. Mozzicato, how are you? I'm great. My tree, however... not so much. I see that. Lost half of its needles overnight. There's still three weeks until Christmas, Jack. The tree isn't supposed to look like this for another month. I know. There's something wrong with this year's entire crop, so I have been refunding pretty much everybody. There you go. I'm sorry to hear that. Any idea what's going on? I can't figure it out, and no one around here seems to know what it is. Listen, I completely understand if you want to buy a tree from somewhere else. You've always been so generous to our family, even when we couldn't afford a tree. We can wait a bit longer. I don't want you to not have a Christmas tree. Well, if we still don't have one on Christmas Eve, then we'll worry about it. Thank you, Calvin. Thank you. Hi. Hi, Mom. Oh, hi, honey. Hey, your dad and I want to know what time you'll be home on Friday night. Our party starts at 6. Oh, and don't forget to bring your dress and that beautiful red coat for the Christmas Eve gala at the marina. No, no. I thought that was canceled. It's only because the committee knew that everybody important was going to be at your wedding, and so once you canceled... The Christmas Eve gala was back on. Right. So we can't very well just sit around Christmas Eve moping. I'm not moping. Oh. Well, good. So then you'll come. I really don't want to. Oh. Well, everyone wants to see you. I don't want to talk to everyone. Honey, I know you've always been more comfortable around plants than people, but your dad and I want you to come home. We want to make sure you're okay. I'm fine. I'm happy I ended things. The life Justin wanted was just too much like... Like...? Never mind. Doesn't matter now. Love you. See you at home. But when? Soon. Promise. The gala. Oh... You don't have to make dinner for me, Mom. This has been my kitchen for 40 years. I'll do what I want. You didn't have to move into that active adult community. You know that, right? Your father and I made those arrangements when he got sick. He didn't want me to spend my golden years sitting around here all by myself. I'm here. Yes, but you're terrible at mah-jongg. Oh, honey, all my friends are there. It's kind of like college, only I don't have to study or take a test... and I can sleep till noon. I love it. Good. This is going to be your house now, and you will raise your family here. Here we go. Of course, first you actually have to try to find someone. I'm, uh, too busy for that, Mom. Life isn't just about work. It is when you're trying to keep your family's hundred-year-old business in the black. Well, they all managed to find some balance between work and family. Right now, I just want to try to figure out what's wrong with my trees, and then I'll... and then I'll worry about balance, okay? Ooh... Kelly, Elliott. I was hoping you'd stop by. Hi, Mrs. Connor. Sit. I made turkey chili. - Oh, score! - Yes! I knew it. You guys only like me for my mom's cooking. I thought that had been firmly established. For you. Oh. You heard. A few people at the tasting room talking about it. By "a few," you mean... Pretty much everyone. So, any luck figuring out what's going on? No. My mom's never seen anything like this in the past. I've gone through my dad and grandpa's journal. There's nothing, and even the local arborist doesn't know what it is. What are you going to do? Reeve Sawyer said there's some kind of Christmas tree expert over at UConn, so I'm going to call there in the morning. Well, I'll be right here with you. - Thanks, man. - Uh, Elliott, I won't be here for breakfast in the morning. Oh. Then I'll be with you in spirit. Right. Olivia, what are you still doing here? You're going to hit standstill traffic going from here down to Westport. That's the plan. Are you sure you're doing okay? I know this was supposed to be your wedding weekend... I'm fine. Why does everyone think I'm not fine? Because you never talk about it. That doesn't mean I'm not fine. It just means I don't want to talk... Don't want to talk about it. Got it, got it. Hmm. It's just, you know, you're barely even acknowledging that it's Christmas. Truthfully, I'm just Christmassed out. All my parents care about is people seeing their perfect Christmas. It's a lot. If I could skip the whole thing this year, I would. Oh, yes! There's a huge traffic jam on the Merritt. Okay, well, you can't sit around here the entire break. At least come out with me and Adam for Christmas Eve. Didn't you say you thought Adam was going to propose to you on Christmas Eve? Well, yes, but that... But nothing. I'm fine. It's a few days of my mom saying, "Is that what you're wearing?" I'm going to be fine. Okay. - Olivia Arden. - Yeah, hi. I'm hoping you can help me. A friend said that there was someone over there that's an expert on Christmas trees. Oh, you're probably looking for the chief evergreen horticulturist at the UConn College of Agriculture. Yes, that sounds like the person I'm looking for. That's me. What can I help you with? Look, I know it's only a week before Christmas, so you're probably busy or on vacation, but my fir trees are dropping needles almost immediately after being cut. No one locally seems to know what's going on. I'm the fourth-generation owner of this farm. We've never seen anything like this before, and I just... I'm getting pretty desperate, and I was wondering if you happen to have time, you could come to Avon, and... I have time, actually. Yes, I do have time. How's this afternoon? I can get up to Avon in less than an hour. Really? That's amazing. You're not too busy? I mean, I think I can squeeze you in. That's incredible news. It's Connor's Christmas Trees, 523 Rock Oak Lane. Okay. I will see you soon. See you soon. Looks like I'm up for a little detour. Okay, see you in a little bit. I'll see you in a bit, Mom. Oh, wait. What time is the person from UConn getting here? She's going to be here within the hour. I'm just going to go do a quick pickup for Miss Plankis. Well, look on the bright side. From what I've heard, our customers are willing to wait until they can buy from us again this year. Now, that's loyalty. And, uh, you earned it. Thank you, but that took a decade to build, and I could lose it all if our customers don't have a tree by Christmas. Yeah. Anyway, look, I'll see you in 20 minutes. Yeah. Enter roundabout. Enter roundabout. Oh! Exit right. Seriously? Oh, man. Recalculating route. Too late, lady. Are you okay? I'm fine. You? Oh, I'm fine. It was just a love tap. Sorry, that's just what people call it, which doesn't make any sense, considering it's almost always a total stranger. It seems a little more like a punch than a tap. You did hit the brakes pretty hard. Well, it was my exit, so I slowed down. Looks like you realized that a smidge too late. If you weren't tailgating... I wasn't tailgating. Okay, you know what? Let's just exchange insurance info. Right. Yeah. This is just what I need today. Well, I'm sure there isn't too much damage. No. That tree, on the other hand... looks totaled. You got that right. That's why I was in a rush. I'm meeting someone who supposedly knows how to fix it. Here you go. Uh, yeah. Yeah. They call her the Christmas Tree Whisperer... Which is a bit much, if you ask me. Well, that's pretty cheesy, but maybe she doesn't call herself that. And... maybe she really is that good. Maybe... but I'm trying not to get my hopes up. Anyway, listen. Just get me the estimate, and I'll take care of all this. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm going to need your info. Yes. Oh, shoot. I'm trying to find it. Oh, sorry. It's not you. It's just I'm going to be late. I have this meeting. So do I. Oh yeah? Where are you headed? Connor's Christmas Trees. Right. Yeah. See you there. Yeah. Oh no. Oh no. I am really sorry. Clearly, you were heading somewhere after our meeting. Oh, just to Westport for a week. Christmas with the family. You can't do that without a tailpipe. Nope. Yeah, if you don't mind the engine stalling every few minutes. And the noise. And the fumes. Yes, yes. I must stay and wait for the repairs. For the planet. It's fine if I get there a little late tonight. Actually, I just got a text from the shop. It looks like the replacement won't be here until tomorrow. Darn the luck. I feel like you're not really in a rush to get home. Listen, my cousin Lisa runs the Old Avon Inn. It's a few blocks from here. Why don't you stay overnight till your car's ready, and we'll take care of it? You don't have to do that. You didn't have to come here, and you did, and I appreciate it. I mean, it would be better to take the soil samples at dawn. That way, I'd get the best temperature for measuring microbes and moisture. There you go. Win-win. Unless, of course, they're not fixable. Then it's win-lose. Who wins? Well, you. You still get paid. I'm not going to charge you if I can't help you. I'm not going to let you work for free. Wait. Does that mean you don't think you can actually help me? I didn't say that. Oh, you're hedging your bets. I'm all about evergreens. I don't do hedges. Hmm. Lisa, thank you so much for this. This is Olivia. Hi. Well, I just hope you can help. I'll do everything I can. Well, you came on the perfect night. Tonight's our big Christmas open house. Dinner, dessert, my famous hot cocoa... I know everyone always says their famous whatever-they-make is the best, but hers really is. Thank you for the invitation, but I'm really just here to work. Okay. Well, um, here is the code to your room, and just in case you change your mind, here is a flyer to this week's community Christmas events. You might change your mind. - Okay. - It's... Okay. Uh... I... - Oh, you want a hand? - No, I'm good, thanks. Okay. Let us know if you need anything. Man... I hit her car. - What? - Yeah. I hit her car. That's a great start, Jack. I know. Okay. All right. Hi, Mom. I ended up coming up to Avon for a freelance job. It was supposed to be quick, and, uh, my car ended up needing repairs. Oh. Well, so when are you getting here? Tomorrow. Sometime. Sorry about that. Do I hear Christmas music? Uh, yeah. There's some Christmas party going on downstairs. You're going to a party? Oh... is that what you're wearing? I'm working. Well, still, honey. Speaking of that, I've got to go. Love you. Bye. Hey, guys. How's it going? Hey, Jack. Oh, Mayor McGuire. How are you? Good, good. I was hoping to run into you. I hear you're having some tree troubles. Now, I don't need to tell you how important this year's Christmas Eve tree lighting is. It's a hundred years. I know, it's always been a Connor tree. You have nothing to worry about, Sean. I guarantee it. Okay, thank you, Jack. I just needed to hear it from the farmer's mouth. Well, you got it. - Mayor? - Oh, okay. I've got to go. Hey. Listen, we need to talk about the tree. I know, and I know it's going to be bad news. So first, we cocoa. We what? We cocoa. Come. Oh. All right. This is the best hot cocoa you have ever had. What is this, a down payment? I get the rest after I finish the job? No, the rest is toppings, and that's the best part. Oh, I actually prefer it without toppings. Not even whipped cream? Uh... It's just filler. It's the tinsel of hot chocolate. A purist, huh? I guess I just prefer things in their natural state. Oh. Take an evergreen. Did you know that originally people just brought these trees into their homes in the winter for the beauty of the greenery itself? Right. But until the decorations are on it, it's not really a Christmas tree. I mean, that's kind of what makes it special. Well, there's nothing wrong with letting things just be what they are. Hmm. Mm. Top notch. Right? As is. Okay. All right, I'm ready for the news. Hit me. All right. Well, I only have a couple of theories right now, but... Um... You have... you have a little something on your face. I do? Where is it? Like, up here? That... no, um... Just down there? So I got it? Yeah. There's still more. A little bit more over here? Okay. There we go. Look, it's not fair for me to guess and ruin your night. Is that because your guess is that I'm doomed? Look, enjoy the party, and we'll start from scratch first thing in the morning. Thanks for the cocoa. You're welcome. Hey. Hey, are you sure you don't want to stay? They're actually about to start the caroling. Oh, no. Me singing would definitely ruin your night. Hello? Hey. I'm here. Where are you? Hey. Uh, I'm in the barn. I'll be right there. Need a hand? Oh! Hey. No. I'm all done. Thank you. So you're having a Christmas fair? Yeah. We do a last-minute shopping event every year. All the vendors come out. It's this weekend. Huh. Hopefully by then, the lot will be back open. It should be. I haven't been stumped yet. Stumped. I like that. Uh, don't say, "I see what you did there," because I didn't. It's okay. I be-leaf you. Do you do this a lot? All the time. My friends hate it. It's because I was born in the fall. The fall? Yeah. Sep-timber. Come with me. It's this way. These all look perfect. Yeah, exactly. I mean, they're thriving... until they're cut. Could I see a tree that's been cut within the last two days? Yeah. There's actually one next door at the cidery. This is the tree. This is after only two days? Yep, I'm afraid so. Now, what do you think? Do you think this is needle cast? No. No, needle cast disease doesn't work this quickly. This is something else. Hi. I'm Kelly. This is Elliott. - Morning, guys. - Hi. Hello. I'm Olivia Arden. Thank you for letting me take a cutting of your tree. Of course. Anything for my brother here. Oh. You're brothers? Uh, he wishes, 'cause then maybe he'd be a little bit taller. Yeah, and he could afford a jacket with sleeves. Our families are best friends. We spent almost every Christmas together growing up. That's actually what started our PJ-all-day tradition. Huh. What? I had to get dressed in my Christmas best before even coming down to see if Santa came. Really? It's fine. You know what you need? Some fresh hard cider. Oh! It's00 in the morning. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. We're trying to crack the Bloody Mary-mimosa market. Guys, Olivia's got a lot of work to do. Okay, well, then, at least try the soft cider. Right out of the barrel. All right. Yeah? Thank you. That's really complex. I taste notes of, um, peach, cinnamon, and... vanilla? You have a well-developed palate. I've always loved how certain flavors are connected to the minerals in the soil, and how it changes from acre to acre. You know, every farm has its own unique taste. See? She gets it. Yeah. The soil in this part of Connecticut is great for apples and pears and berries and pumpkins. You know, you could grow something for every season, not just Christmas. We just do Christmas trees. I know. What I'm saying is if you diversify, you wouldn't be so dependent on one commodity. I'm going to stop you right there. Here we go. My father and his grandfather and his father had a motto, which was "Do one thing, and be the best." Christmas trees are my one thing, and they're my family's legacy, and it's my job to keep it that way. And that's what I'm here to help you do. Right. So let's rush these samples to the mobile lab. Thank you so much for the cider, it was wonderful, and lovely to meet you. Yeah, you too. - Thanks, guys. - Hey! Hey, bring her back for the cocktail thing. She's not on vacation, Kelly. Well, after dealing with you, she'll probably need one. Good morning. Hi. I'm returning... the pencil I borrowed. Real smooth, Mom. I'm assuming that Elliott told you? Of course not. Thank you so much for saving our farm. Olivia, this power hugger is my mom, Peggy. Mom, this is Olivia. Uh, nice to meet you, but no need to thank me. I haven't done anything yet. But I'm sure you will, though. How long does all this testing take? Unfortunately, it's not an instant result. This has to sit for at least a few more hours. So you have some time to kill? I suppose so. Hmm. Oh. Michel said my car wouldn't be ready till 6. I don't want to be your guys' way, so if you want to drop me off at the inn, I can hang out there and catch up on paperwork. Not a problem. Paperwork? Nonsense. No. You're going to come with us to the cider mill. Oh, I've been there already today. It's fine. You don't have to... Well, didn't you tell her about the Christmas cocktail competition? She's not interested in that, Mom. Oh. Or maybe you're just scared someone new might dethrone you? I'm not too worried about that. Probably because you've never had to compete against a scientist. Hmm. Well, mixology is just chemistry equations in a glass. It's all about balance. Really? Mm-hmm. I thought that it was all about Christmas, apple cider, and instinct. Mm... No? - No. - Hmm. Yep. He's scared. Really? Okay. Let's do this. Mom, what's going on with you and Harry? - Harry? - Yeah. Absolutely nothing. He's just excited to get a free drink. Sure. I am ready. Me too. Ooh. Okay. Everyone ready? - Yes. - Yes. Remember, the only rule is you have to use some of our cider in your cocktail. And... go. All right. Wow. It's... scientific. How are the levels? Not telling. Four generations of Christmas tree farming, huh? Yep. Hey, are you going to use that mint? No. Thank you. And you never wanted to do anything else? Never. Actually, that's not true. When I was a little kid, I wanted to be the next Indiana Jones, but... once I discovered that it was less about really cool action sequences and more about sitting alone in a hole dusting off rocks with tiny little brushes, I got over that. How about you? Did you always know that this would be your calling? Bartending? Yeah. Um... Pull that for me? - There you go. - Thank you. I don't know, I've always felt happiest in the woods. I totally get that. Yeah. Um, yeah, I'm going to... lime. You don't like talking much about yourself, do you? I'm more of a listener, I guess. Five more minutes. - Whoa. Okay. - Okay. Thank you. Right. Okay, let's do this. Oh yeah. All right. How's that smell? Perfect. Hmm? Hmm? Okay. Everybody, gather 'round. Okay, moment of truth. Ah, so what's in yours again? Oh. Well, it's a perfect blend of cider, bourbon, cinnamon, lime, and herbs. Oh. And... a few pine needles. Wait. That wasn't on the ingredients list. Technically, it was on the table, so I think it's fair game. Fine. What's in yours? Oh, a little bit of this and then just a bit of that, and it doesn't really matter, because I just go by what feels right. Oh. I just go by what I know is right. So... We'll see how that plays out for you. Pretty good strategy. Hmm, we'll see. Ahem. Hmm. Oh, yeah. Wow. Excuse me, excuse me. That is awful. Yeah. - Come on. - Truly awful. Come on. Is this the cup everyone poured their discarded drinks into, or... It's been a tough year for me. Listen, you can't win 'em all, so... Actually, she can. We have a winner of the Christmas cocktail competition. Olivia. Olivia. - Really? - Really? Science for the win! Thank you. I, uh... I won't let it go to my head. Good. Yeah. All right, I need to try this drink. Let me see here. Mm. Wow. That is incredible. - Yeah? - Yeah. What are you going to call it? How about the Evergreen? It's perfect. To the Evergreen! Evergreen! To the Evergreen. Clink. That was really impressive. I just think if you would have seen the one I made last year, I think it could have actually... Hey. - Hi. - Hi. Jack, I just want to thank you for the business that you've given us the past couple days. Well, don't get used to it, Dwayne. Olivia, this is Dwayne. He owns the other Christmas tree lot in town. Maybe the only one at the rate you're going, Jack. Connor's will be fine. I'll make sure of it. And... who are you, exactly? I'm an evergreen expert. You don't need a tree lady to tell you what we already know. You're done. Oh, and tell the mayor I have a 30-foot Scotch pine if he needs it. All he has to do is call. He won't need to. Good day. Who is that guy? Dwayne Colson. You're hovering. No, no, I'm just, you know, decorating the house for Christmas in your general vicinity. Right. Wow. Oh no. Is it broken? I don't think so. Well, until we can keep these needles from falling, maybe we should take the ornaments down. I know I should. It's just that we've been putting these up since the very first year my family started selling Christmas trees. There's one new ornament for every year that we've been in business. It's a tradition. Every single one of these has a... special meaning. This one is from the year I was born. 27 years ago. And this one, this is from World War II. My grandfather was overseas, and he sent back some sand from Normandy. My family doesn't do anything like this. What does your family do? Every year, my mother chooses a theme, and her decorator does the rest. All that matters is how it looks, not what it means. What was this year's theme? It was supposed to be a Christmas wedding. Uh... No, no, that's cool. I mean, whose wedding? Oh. I canceled it. Over the summer. So... Right. I'm sorry. Don't be. No, you know, we wanted different things. So... Right. Just took you six months before your wedding to figure that out? I knew before then. Sometimes it takes me a little bit longer to say things out loud. Ah. One of my quirks. Bless you. Excuse me. I hope I'm not getting sick. That's the last thing I need right now. Well, stress does make you more susceptible to viruses. Oh, that's great. I'm doomed. Wait a minute. Maybe that's what's going on here. There could be a disease in the trunk that's getting set off from the stress of being cut. Like transplant shock? Kind of. Ugh. I wish I could see what was going on in the trunks. You realize you're telling the guy who sells cut trees that the solution might be to not cut trees. I'm saying I don't know yet. I just... oh! You know what would help? To dig up the root ball with one of the trunks. I could cut it and watch what happens over the next few hours in real time. Yeah, we could do that. We'll cut it out, and... It's almost00. Your car is ready, and my time is up. Oh. Well, I'll stay. - Really? - Yeah. I can stay one more night and get my car tomorrow. Well, I appreciate that. Of course. Even if you're staying just so you can avoid your family. I care what happens to you. - And... and your farm. - Right. And there's no way I'm letting that Dwayne guy win. Okay, maybe the home thing, too... a little. I knew it. All right. We're lucky it was warmer this week. The ground's not too hard. Yeah. Oh. Looks like that's about to change. Oh, nothing like a bit of mood snow at Christmas. Beautiful. Right? Olivia? Over here. Come on. - Ah... - What are you doing down here? This quiet... under the trees... it's my favorite thing in the whole world. It's like I'm just living in this exact moment where everything's perfect just the way it is. It's amazing how something as simple as a tree can bring people so much happiness. That's why I love what I do. My life's purpose is to literally bring joy to families every Christmas. If I can't do that anymore... You don't have to worry, Jack. I got this. Hey! Jack. Miles. What are you doing here? I saw a light and thought someone was stealing one of your trees while you're shut down. Oh. No. We're just... doing scientific research. Is that what they're calling it these days? No, no. It really was. Okay. You two have a good night. Thanks, Miles. Can you call him tomorrow and tell him it was actual science? Well... Not all of it. No, not all of it. We should, uh... let's get the... dig up the tree. Tree. Yeah. One, two, three. - Yep. Go. - Push it. Yeah. Yeah. Here we go. One more. Hey, nice. Grab that. There we go. Careful, it's a little bit slippery out here. Please. I'm a third-generation New Englander. I'm... I'm good. Don't... say... a word. I would never. I'm a fourth-generation Connecticutian, so... Oh! Don't you dare. Don't you... Just... Let's get this inside. This is humiliating. There you go. Watch your step. How is it out there? I heard it's like a skating rink. Um, didn't notice. No, not at all. Hey, I, uh... I could pick you up in the morning after breakfast and we can go get your car whenever you're ready. Maybe after 10? Yeah. That's perfect. Right. Uh, right here? Yeah. There we go. I'll let you... there you go. - Yeah. - Yeah. Till then, it'll just be good old-fashioned scientific method. Which is... Sitting next to the tree and staring at it all night. Right. Hope we get the answers. Hey, we're getting there. Yeah. Oh... thanks. Night. Good night. Ho ho ho ho ho! Thank you for letting me make my way through here. How's everybody feeling? This is Lisa the Elf, and she's going to be my helper today. Oh! This is beautiful. Who made this for you? My mom. Oh, it's absolutely wonderful. I could use her advice shopping. Good morning. Hey. Can I get you some breakfast? Uh, I'm actually looking for Jack. I, uh... I overslept a little bit. He's... here. Oh, it's a very special treat. Oh, I see, you want a candy cane. I'm sure I've got a candy cane. Someone will get you a candy cane. Hi. So, this is one of the favors you do for her, huh? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, I heard Santa was here. Santa was here? Yes. And if you hurry, maybe you can give him your Christmas list. Oh, I think he already knows my Christmas list. You don't need Santa for that. You've got me. Yeah. So, how was it looking overnight? You know what to do? I know what's next. I feel like when you're vague like that it's because you're holding something back. I'm not. There's just no point in getting your hopes up, or down, until I know for sure. And when will that be? After I pick up my car and bring the samples back to the lab on campus. My equipment is good, but the lab is the best. Right. Sorry. You're too tired to drive. Why don't I take you? Are you sure you have time? Yeah. I mean, until we get this figured out, I've got nothing but time. Okay. All the tests are up and running. Now I just need to make sure I didn't forget anything. Don't touch that! No, I'm not. I just want to take a look at my master checklist. Yes. What is all this? Oh no. I thought we canceled the order. That's a lot of mistletoe. They were my wedding favors. That must have cost a fortune. Oh yeah, they did. I would've been happy giving everyone a bag of candy almonds. Why didn't you say something? Because this wasn't even in the top 100 things I needed to say to him. So what are you going to do with them now? Why don't you sell them at the craft fair? We can donate the proceeds to charity. Really? Yeah. I love that idea. Especially since I usually donate Christmas trees to families in need, and this way, we can help them buy a tree from somewhere else. Are you sure you're okay with that? Yeah. Of course. I mean, my problem shouldn't become theirs, and for them, it's not just about the tree. It's... it's about what happens around it. Uh, okay. So we're good here. All we have to do now is wait. Great. For how long? Uh, about ten hours. Ten hours? Give or take. I feel like this is going to be the longest ten hours of my life. Well, you know, we don't have to stay that long. Everything's automated, so once it's done, the results will upload to the server, and I can read them from anywhere. Yeah. I just feel like I'm going to go nuts waiting. Some of these things look like they could maybe be fun? They are fun, and thank you. Don't thank me yet. It's going to be fun. Come on in. Um, you know, why don't we take this spot here? So what we're going to... Oh, uh, Lisa, do we have any gingerbread trees? Oh, I couldn't find the cookie cutter for that, but if you want trees made out of Santa hats, I'm your gal. How are you at baking? Terrible. Me too. Well, no trees for us, then. I will not stand for such irony. Come on. That is brilliant. - I mean, right? - Brilliant. All right, I'm going to need... Uh, we had no choice. I feel like you did. Yeah. Oh no. There aren't any more gingerbread houses. Oh. Hey, let's make a gingerbread version of your Christmas tree lot. - That's a great idea. - Right? This way... Those results can't come fast enough. You know, Jack, this might not be a quick fix. If you can't open your lot again this year... Then I'm going to have to email all my loyal customers and tell them to get a tree from someplace else. Not Dwayne, though. Please? Well, there's nothing I can do about that. I just hope they come back again next year. If there's something for them to come back for. Yes, and that's my goal, to be up and running next year at the very latest, but if that doesn't happen, I just... I just want to make sure that, you know, you'll be okay. I mean, we can cover one bad year, but if all of the trees are diseased, then I don't know what I'm going to do. Which is why I suggested having different crops to harvest year-round. Olivia, I don't want to talk about this. Hey, it doesn't have to be fruit. The soil's great for ornamental plants, for shrubs... I mean, like, you know... little... shrubs... Yeah, okay, and what kind of shrub is a pink shrub? Azaleas, obviously. Mm, mm-hmm. No, I think I'm going to stick with trees. You know, azaleas bring people joy, too. The point is that diversifying would just mean that you wouldn't be so dependent on Christmas to survive. My dad would look at all those farms that did it all, and he would say, "Jack of all trades, master of none." He would be so disappointed in me if I changed all that now. I get it. Being named Jack doesn't really help me here. But at least you'd have something to fall back on when things like this happen. Okay. So you're an expert on evergreens. But what if I told you you also had to be an expert on roses or... mangoes? They don't grow mangoes in Connecticut. You know what I mean. Yeah, I... I get it. Sorry I brought it up. Forget I said anything. Oh. Well, that's a sign. It's... it's a cookie. You know what? Maybe it's time for us to move on to something else. Wow, that is impressive. Thank you. You really are a natural. Who knew? I kind of had a feeling. Oh, and... hmm? Love it. Right? See? Wasn't so bad, was it? It was wonderful. Yeah. I'm not going to get you. - Okay, okay. - Hold it tight. I should've learned my lesson last time. And... whssht! - See? I told you. - See, I got you again. And I don't get the thing about the empty presents. It's like an empty promise. I mean... Oh, man. What is it? The mayor's going to be here any minute, and he's going to ask for an update on the Christmas Eve tree. Can you check to see if there are any results? Because I could really use some good news right now. Sorry, nothing yet. Great. I've been meaning to ask you, why does the town wait all the way until Christmas Eve to light the tree? The very first year Connor's opened for business, there was this huge storm on Christmas Eve, and all the power went out all over town, except for the square, so my great-grandfather got the biggest tree we had and brought it down, and people from all over town came, and they decorated it with lights and ornaments, and... that's when it stopped being a Connor tree and became everyone's tree. And then from that day forward, that just became a Christmas Eve tradition to light the tree. No wonder it means everything to you. It does. Hey, the barn looks great, Jack. Hey, thanks. But I see that the tree lot's still closed for business. Yeah. Well, you know what? We're coming up with a really good solution. This is Olivia. She is UConn's chief evergreen horticulturalist. Hello. Nice to meet you. The thing is, that tree has to be in place by Tuesday so we have time to decorate. Okay, great. Well, we've got three days, and that should be fine. I'm sorry, but because we're getting extra press for the hundredth annual lighting, we can't risk waiting until the last minute. That's why I came down in person. I've decided to go with Dwayne Colson's tree instead. Listen, we started the tradition of lighting the tree on Christmas Eve, and I have never asked for anything in return. Just this once, I'm asking if you can wait until Tuesday, and if the tree's not in good shape, you can go with Dwayne Colson, and I wouldn't blame you. All right. Three days, Jack. Thank you. We can do that, right? Three days is enough time? Oh, it's just my mom. Hi, Mom. Hi, Olivia. I was going to call you. This job in Avon's taking a little longer than I thought. It is really starting to seem that you're avoiding us. I've... just been busy. Well, I made a nail appointment for you because I know how much you just hate all that dirt under there from work. I'm... fine with it. Uh, listen, Mom. I've got to get back to work. I'll be home as soon as I can. Okay? Love you. Bye. Oh. This is it. The lab results. What does it say? The tests haven't identified any common diseases or pathogens, and now we've ruled out environmental contaminants. Okay, so what does that mean? There's nothing we can do? We're going to have to do a full genetic sequencing of the DNA to get our answer. We will get the answer, but that's going to take a few... Days? That's okay. Weeks. Weeks? Jack, I'm so sorry. I really wish there was a faster way. Okay, so what does that mean for my trees that are in the ground for this year, and the big Christmas Eve tree? See, this is where you're supposed to say, "Don't worry, Jack. I know how to save this year's trees." Don't worry, Jack. I know how to save this year's trees. Olivia, I just really need you to tell me what you're really thinking. Please. I'm worried. Because right now, I don't know how to save them. Hey. If anyone can figure it out, it's you, and there's no one else I'd rather have in my corner. Thank you, Jack. Okay, I'm going to go do some more research. What's going on? Oh, uh... it doesn't look good. I'd say it's looking pretty great. I'm talking about the trees. For the first time in a hundred years, there might not be a Connor family tree in the town square. But for the first time in what seems like a thousand years, you have a chance at love. It's not the right time, Lisa. It's never the right time for you, Jack. It's okay to care about your trees and your legacy and your farm, but that can't be the only thing you care about... especially now that you've met someone like Olivia. Morning. Hey. Good morning. What have you got there? Oh, I got my car, drove to UConn, raided the supply room at the lab, and got everything I need. I think I found a way to keep this year's trees alive for a week or so after getting cut. Come on. I knew you could do it. It's a temporary fix, and I'm not done yet, but if I'm right, between this and the DNA work, by next year, it'll be like none of this ever happened. Well, except for the part where I met you, because I could do that again in a heartbeat. Me too. Okay, so what's the plan? Okay. So whatever's going on is getting triggered by the tree getting cut and losing vital nutrients from the soil, right? So I created a highly concentrated formula to add to your trees' water after they're cut. You just give it to your customers for the trees. Kind of like the package you put in vases when you buy flowers. Except this has to be calibrated to dissolve evenly over time... like an extended-release medicine. Huh. Now I just have to figure out how to create a solid base for the formula. Wow. Wouldn't that be easier to do in your lab? Yeah, but, you know, it's convenient to be here to test it on the trees. - Right. - And... but, you know, you're right. I'll go back to the lab. It's, um... it's... - No, no, no. - Probably better. You can totally do it here. You can do it in the house. The truth is, most of this is too messy to do in the house. What about the barn? What about the craft fair? The craft fair doesn't have to take up the whole barn. Wait a minute. Why not move part of the craft fair outside? You could have a whole, like, outdoor section decorated with the lights and wreaths. Everyone would be outside in nature, really feeling the Christmas spirit. Sort of like you are right now. I guess I am. But I don't know how you'd get all that together so quickly. Oh, easy-peasy. I'll get my mom on it. It'll be done within the hour. Really? Yeah. It's the best part about living in a small community. We're all here to help one another. I really think this is it, Jack. I really think so too. Guys, this is beautiful. I love it. Hey, how are you? Oh, mm, smells so good. Oh. Mom, this is amazing. Oh, thank you so much for rallying the troops. Wow. Are you kidding? These people were lined up waiting to help. You should do this every year. You know, this was actually Olivia's idea. We're lucky she's here. Well, luck has nothing to do with it. It's fate. I don't know about that. She's here to do a job, Mom. You think this is really about her job? Oh, no. It's all about you now, Jack. - No. - Yeah. Harry! I should really keep working. Right. Well, I think you should give your brain a break. Come. Oh, my goodness. This looks incredible. Right? And this is all thanks to your idea. Come on. Let's take a little stroll together. Harry, you know I adore you, right? But ever since Stanley died, I just never saw myself strolling with anyone else. Me neither, but, you know, we can either choose to embrace the future or resist it, and... I pick embrace. Come on. All right. They are adorable. Yeah. Hey, are you okay with your mom... Yeah. No, I mean, you know what? My dad's been gone a while, and she deserves to be happy. Your mom's pretty lucky if she found that twice. Some people don't even find it once. Hey. Let's go for a walk. Sorry. I've got sap on my hands. Oh. Wait! Jack, this is the answer I've been looking for. This is what we can use to bond the nutrients together. Let's go! I want to see if it works. Okay. Hey. - This is it? - I think so. All we need now is a tree to test it on. Well, I've got plenty of those. Let's go. This is it. Yeah. Okay. Well, I guess I'll drive you back to the inn. Are you kidding? I'm not going anywhere. Well, then, I guess... you should get comfortable. Thank you. You don't have to stay up. Of course I do. I want to see what happens. - Morning. - Morning. Uh, check on the tree. Yeah. Hey, not bad. - Good morning. - Good morning. We brought some breakfast. Oh, thank you. So, did it work? We're not going to know for sure until later tonight. Oh, it seems like a lot of waiting around. Well, nature does not hurry, but everything is accomplished. That's beautiful. Did you make that up? Yeah. Wow, that's incredible. It's very similar to Lao Tzu from 5,000 years ago. Yes. Do you study Chinese philosophy? A little, yeah. Yeah. Also, it was on a poster in your office. Busted! Good morning! Squeeze in. Did it work? They won't know until later. So we're just going to sit here all day and stare at it? That's the plan. Yeah. I guess we can work around you for the party? Ohh... You forgot. Did not forget. I just didn't remember on time. What exactly are we talking about? I'm having my annual gift exchange party here tonight. You're going to love it. You can keep your eye on the tree and have fun while you're doing it. That sounds fun, but I don't have a gift to bring. That's actually the easy part. Do you guys mind continuing with the tree watching? Come on. Okay. Okay. $20 max, and you shouldn't see what the other person is getting, so you're going to have to be pretty stealth about it. Okay. Hmm... Oh, come on. I mean... Aw. I think that's my size. This is nice. Oh, very good. It's a bit strong. Hello? Hello? Hello? - Oh. - Oh. I'll wait over here. - Okay. - Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So, everyone draws a number, and then the first person picks a gift and opens it. I knew it. Then the second person opens their gift, and they can keep it... Yes. Somebody knows I love cheese. Or they can trade it with the first person. Then the third person opens their gift. Aw! They can keep that one, or they can steal from the first two. And at the end, whoever went first gets one more chance to steal. It gets pretty ugly. "The History of the Christmas Tree." - Ooh. - That's very nice. History of baseball would've been nicer, but who am I to complain? Oh, who am I kidding? Give me the blanket. There we go. Okay, it's my turn. I'm going for this one. I saw it, I want it. - Oh. - Yeah. Oh, this has never happened before. Wow. Look at that. I'm keeping it. Oh, I guess I'm up. - Yes. - Go for it. Which one should I pick? Ooh, wow. Look at that. Oh! That's the best one of the night. I know you're going to keep that. Actually... I think I'll trade it for the book. Really? Yeah. Well, Jack said you favor trees in their natural state. Oh, did he? Christmas trees... are growing on me. Oh! That is good. She's worse than Jack. Okay, on that note, Jack, you can either keep the book, or you can trade it for whatever you like the most. Okay, well, I'm going to say I did really like... the book. Great minds. Wait a minute, what's going on? Shh. Let's go read. Okay, who is ready for yule log? - Yes! - Yes, yes. Okay. Olivia, you're first. There is an ornament baked inside, and whoever finds it gets to switch on the lights at the tree ceremony. But I'm not family. Everything you have done to help Jack and the farm, you will always be family to us. Okay, but right now, it's all a big maybe. What if the fix doesn't work? Well, then we shun you. Fair enough. All right. Oh! Whoa. Look at that! That's great. Okay, who wants cake? Oh yeah. I wish Christmas felt like this at my house. Why can't it? It's just not what my parents do. Oh. Well, have you told them what you wanted Christmas to be like? You know, you can't expect your parents to solve a problem that they don't even know they have. Hmm? How's the cake? Beginner's luck? I don't know. That was pretty good. Well, I guess we've got a couple hours until we can check on the tree. I'm almost afraid to look. I'm not. I trust you. Uh... - Oh. - Cake? Oh, thank you. And one for you. Thank you. Is it wrong that part of me is hoping it doesn't work quite yet? So she doesn't leave Avon so soon? Yes, very wrong. And I was thinking the exact same thing. This looks good. Let's check the others. None of the needles have fallen off. It worked? It worked. - It worked! - It worked! It worked. It worked! Hey. Yeah! Okay, Mr. Mozzicato, you've got the eight-foot tree, right? Yes. That is this one here for you. There you go. Thank you, Jack, and merry Christmas. Merry Christmas and thank you. Are you sure we're going to have enough of these for the town tree? Oh, plenty. Perfect. Hi. You've got the six-foot tree, right? Yes, I knew it. Right. Here you go. Would you mind covering from here? Thank you. Good luck, big guy. Yeah. Okay, fine. Yes, I do talk to trees. Happy? You have no idea. Come on. Hop in. We've got to put up this tree. Up, up, up, up, up. Keep going. Right about there. Perfect. That's it. Nice. All right. It looks beautiful. Ah. Glad to see it turned out okay, Jack. Yeah, it turned out better than okay. We'll get started decorating. Look at you. You saved Christmas, Olivia. I can't thank you enough. I should be thanking you. For the first time in I don't know how long, Christmas isn't something to get through. It's something to treasure. Yeah. I just wish I could take this feeling home with me. Are you sure you can't stay? You saved the tree. You should probably be here tomorrow when we light it up. I want to, but... I mean, my parents would never forgive me, so... Unless you tell them why you want to stay. I mean... if you want to stay. You know I do. For the trees? For more than just the trees. Then say it. It's not that easy for me, Jack. We have come too far not to see this through. Clearly, I'm... I'm talking about us. I'm at UConn, an hour away. What happens after Christmas? I don't know. I just know that for the first time in a long time, I'm thinking about something else. Will this even work? We have solved every other problem. We'll figure this out too. So... meet you here in the morning? It's a date. Yeah, it is. Hi, Mom. Listen, about Christmas Eve. I know you want me to come home, but I think I'm going to stay here in Avon. We're hosting the cocktail hour at the club. We have to be there. I know you do. Olivia, I have told you. No one is going to ask you about the wedding or about Justin. They just want to see you. They don't even know me. Mom, they only know the version of me that you want them to see, but I can't do that anymore. I don't understand any of this. I thought you loved Christmas. I do, now. Now that I know what it could be. Do you care to share what that is? Look, I'll be home Christmas morning, and then... I'm going to show you. Will you really come home? Or will you just call with another reason to stay away? I'll really come. I promise. We have a lot to talk about. Good night, Mom. Love you. What? I don't understand. It was working. And I called some of the customers. They said that their trees were fine. Did we put enough nutrients in here? It's the exact same ratio to trunk size as the others. Wait. These needles look different from the other damaged trees. They look worse. Don't worry, Jack. Today's your lucky day. I have our tree ready to go. It's not your decision, Dwayne. It's up to Mayor McGuire. Who do you think called me? We're cutting down the replacement. It'll be here in three hours. I assume you'll help us out here, right? I mean, we're all on the same team. Are we? Well, you're on the B team now, but, uh, yeah. Jack, tree lady, good day. You can't let him win. It's not about winning anymore. It's about Christmas Eve, and it's about the entire community, and I feel like I've ruined it for everyone. Jack... I'm so sorry. Hey, it's not your fault. You did everything you could. I'm not giving up on your trees. Okay, we have the technology to get to the bottom of this. It's just going to take a little longer than we thought. In the meantime, I can get the entire horticulture team to recommend alternative crops. I told you I wasn't interested. Why would you even bring that up? Because it's the best way out of this. It's not an option. We do Christmas. That's it. That's all I care about. I see. Olivia. Olivia, wait. You know what I mean. I mean, I care about a lot of things. I care about you, too. This just isn't going to work. You told me to say what I was feeling, Jack. And I did. But the truth is, you don't want me to say how I feel... just what you want to hear. Just like everyone else. This isn't about your family, and this isn't about your fiancé or anybody else. This is about us. It's time for me to get back to my life, and you to get back to yours. So that's it? Yeah, I guess we'll just put them in there, Mom. - Yeah, mix up the colors. - Yes. Mind if we use these for the, uh, the good tree? We're all on the same team here, right? No? Nothing? Excuse me. - That's it. - Whoa. Don't let him get to you. Dwayne's right about one thing. It's not about us now. It's about Christmas. In the end, we have to remember what we're celebrating. It's about bringing people joy. I know. Yeah. Where's Olivia? She left. What? Why? Because there's nothing else for her to do here, and there's no reason for her to stay, Mom. You're the reason, Jack. Did you tell her how you feel about her? Yes, I did, and she told me, and then the tree fell apart, and so did everything else. Why? We just don't see eye to eye. About what? She suggested planting more crops again, and I just... I didn't respond very well to it. I don't understand why you won't consider it. Because I promised Dad that I wouldn't change a thing. The Connor name is synonymous with Christmas, and I don't want to destroy a hundred years of tradition. Oh, honey, yes, tradition is important, and so is Christmas, but you know what the most important thing was to your dad? Us. You, our community, our friends... our happiness. That's the legacy he wanted you to keep. It's too late now, Mom. She's gone. It's never too late, Jack. Sometimes you just have to be willing to be open to change. - Roll the window down. - Okay, I am. Well, what are you guys doing here? Annoying people, apparently. You can't stop in traffic. I'll meet you at the coffee shop. - Coffee shop. - Right in there, yeah. You guys really didn't need to come up here. I was just heading home. Do you really think you could drop a bomb on us like that and we'd just let it go? You have a piece of tree in your hair. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I always do. Mom, this is who I am. I'm a woman who has pine needles in her hair and dirt under her fingernails, and absolutely zero desire to get all dressed up for Christmas just to stand around and chat with people who want me to be somebody I'm not. So you don't want to be like us. Then what do you want? I want to spend the entire day in our pajamas. I want to make a mess with the wrapping paper. I want to bake our own cookies, even though I can't bake, and I want to decorate our tree with ornaments that mean something to our family. I don't want it to be about other people's perception of us. I just want it to be... about us. Maybe we should cancel the party tonight. Dad, you don't have to do that. You guys love that party. Yeah, see? Mom doesn't want you to cancel the party. I'm sure you guys wish that I didn't say anything about any of this. It's okay. Don't worry about... I'll see you at home. No, wait. Honey, I've never been very good about expressing myself. I know. Runs in the family. I'm just so, so sorry, Livvy, that I've made you feel anything less than the strong, brilliant, beautiful woman that you've become. You don't need to change anything. I do. But this Christmas... if you still want to come home? Of course I do. I wish I'd said all this years ago. Why now? What changed? Is there something else the matter? Yeah. Aw. Are you sure you don't want to just find him and talk to him? You guys, I love you so much for coming here and for listening, but when it comes to Jack... I blew it. So let's just go home and have our best Christmas ever. Okay? I can't wait to burn some cookies. Love you guys. See you in a couple hours. Drive carefully. Okay. Dwayne Colson texted me. He wants us to stay here and put up the new tree. We already did our job, right? Ignore that. Did you... No. We should probably do that. Yeah, we should probably do that. Hey, you guys work with Dwayne? Yeah. You know him? Yeah, we go way back. Tell him congratulations on the town tree. I mean, I feel bad for the Connors, but hey, nature's going to do what nature's going to do, right? Yeah, nature. Uh, selfie? Yeah. - All right. - Where do you want us? Yeah, yeah, right there is perfect. Yeah, just a little bit... Yeah. Say "Christmas tree." Christmas tree! Hey, this is Jack. Leave a message. Jack, it's me. Dwayne sabotaged the tree with weed killer overnight. Meet me at the tree when you can. Excuse me! What's her problem? Stop! Don't take it down. This tree is going to be just fine. I know you did your best, Olivia, but the same thing happening to this tree as all the rest of them. By tonight, most of these needles are going to be on the ground. No, this is not like the other trees. I'm sorry, but I can't take that chance. Dwayne Colson... Dwayne Colson sprayed this tree with weed killer so it would look like it was dying. Every branch it touched looks like that. Dwayne? I don't know what tree lady's talking about. She's just embarrassed because she failed. Yeah, well, these guys tell a different story. She got you, Dwayne. You just couldn't help yourself, could you? Your mother always cheated at Hearts. Oh... I'm not surprised the acorn didn't fall far from the tree. Good job, Mom. Think what you want, but there's nothing you can do about the needles that have already dropped. You know, is this the type of tree you want on the most important Christmas Eve Avon's ever had? This is what you want people to remember us by? I'd rather have no tree... than one from you. Miles. Really? You called the cops? Let's go down to the station and talk about Avon's vandalism law. Good day, sir. Tree lady... Well played. I hate to say it, but Dwayne is right about one thing. This tree does not look great... and that's being generous. I mean, it might not look perfect, but, I mean, the story behind it is great. I think the media's going to eat it up. You think? Are you kidding? There's a hero and a villain and a love story. Maybe it can be like that story you told me, about the very first year of the tradition. Everyone from town can bring something. It can be everyone's tree again... just a hundred years later. I think that's a great idea. I guess they don't call you the Christmas Tree Whisperer for nothing. Actually, she doesn't like to be called that. Um, it's... it's okay. I kind of like it. Oh. Actually, she kind of likes it now. I feel like I have so many things I want to say to you. Me too. Tree now. Talk later. You two have plenty of time. Oh, I'm so glad you made it. Yeah. I'm sorry if it meant missing that party. Oh, that doesn't matter anymore. We just wanted to see for ourselves what you love about Christmas... and you're wearing the coat that I love. I know. Oh, um, hang on. Okay. Mom, Dad, this is Jack. Mrs. Arden. Mr. Arden. - Lovely to meet you. - Lovely to meet you too. It's such a pleasure. You have an incredible daughter. Oh, we know. Pine needles in her hair, exactly as it should be. Yeah. Is that a cider cart? Yeah. Oh. Oh, yes. Good idea. Your parents seem really nice. I don't know. I was picturing something flashier. Yeah, actually, I was... I was wrong about them. I was wrong about a lot of things, including telling you to change the way you run your farm. You were right about that. I want to expand the crops. But I thought Christmas is the only thing you care about. It was, until I met you. Look, you were just trying to tell me how you felt, and I wasn't listening, and I am so sorry. That's the thing. I told you how I felt about your crops... not about you. Well, now's your chance. Well, in this particular situation, I think it might be better if I just show you. Okay. That was well said. Hey... would you two like to... You guys want to push the button? They're busy. We got this. In ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
