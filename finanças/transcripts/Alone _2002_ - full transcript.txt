Hi, Mum. It's only me, just to say I got back safely. I'm completely jet-lagged. Haven't got a clue what time it is there, so... I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Love you lots. Bye. Hi, this is Alice. Sorry, I can't get to the phone right now, but leave a message after the tone and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Time: 6.15. Get up, get up! Sleep: 4 hours, 16 minutes. Alice... You never loved me. You never helped me. I'm scared. You never loved me. Why did you leave me? Who do we do not tell, Alex? Mummy, why couldn't you help me? Alex! I'm scared. It's all happening again. I love you, Alex. Liar. I must have someone to love me. Hello? - Hey, it's Dominic. Seen any carnage yet? The thing about dead bodies is, they look more realistic in the movies. But you can't smell 'em in the movies. Shut up, Dominic. - They smell like... That is outrageous. Is death a joke to you, Detective? Look, I've got to go. Okay. Bye. You should keep that thing switched off when you're working. I receive calls from the station on it. There's nobody at the station called Dominic. I don't really care what you're training taught you, 'cause here your probation begins and ends with me. For this period... - I understand. For the rest of this period I want you to observe, to listen, to learn. Are you with me? I understand. Now, Detective, go and help with the door-to-door. - But there's no dead body outside. I'll go and help with the door-to-door. Time: 6.15. Get up, get up! Sleep: 4 hours, 57 minutes. Ten seconds to three. Hey, Alex. Hello. - You're always so punctual. Ready? - Yes. - Let's go. How do you like your new caseworker? - She's filthy. She's not that bad. Come! Charlotte... would you be so kind as to bring me the Kidner files? Bye, Charlotte. Do you play any sports, Alex? - No. She's changed the room. - Alex? Are you gonna sit over there every time? -I've always sat here. Well, I'm not gonna do this whole session with you sat over there! You come and sit here by me. Are you sleeping, Alex? - Filthy, dirty... 4 Hours, 57 minutes. That's very precise. What about dreams, Alex? I'm not allowed to talk about them. - Okay. So you don't wanna talk about your dreams? I've been through all this before. - Yeah. Sure. But not with me, you haven't! 3.15. Time's up. We're not getting anywhere with you in this frame of mind. I'll see you next Tuesday. I will never ever leave you, Alex. - Who do we never tell? Why did you lie to me, Mummy? I get the feeling I should be with you, Dad. It's probably a lot less hurtful where you are. I'm really missing John. He's in South Africa apparently. You're right, the hardest part is being alone. The hardest part is being alone! I love you, Dad. I love you. Sarah. Yeah? Don't you want to go home? I'll tell you what, I could set you up a bed in here. That way, you never have to leave. You really want this to be a murder investigation, don't you? Do I? - You're searching for anything. You're so hoping that this is more than a lonely girl who took a tumble. Everything is suspicious with you. When you've been around, you realize that everything is. Well, I've got a conclusion for your report. Suicide. Girl topped herself because she was lonely. Couldn't hack it any more and said "Adios". -It's a theory. Anyway, why are you here? To brighten your mood. Fell backwards down stairs. Who falls backwards down stairs in their own house... alone? Sarah. So, the words "accidental death" mean nothing to you? The chief spoke to me. She can't get hold of you. Is your radio broken? - I switched it off. She's a bit miffed that we're still here and not on the Pomeroy case. Answer's on a postcard. Was it you that sent me that text message? That is the rudest thing I've ever seen. Time: 6.15. Get up, get up! Sleep: 5 Hours, 27 minutes. Time: 6.15. Get up, get up! Sleep: 4 Hours, 58 minutes. Don't listen. Don't listen! The hardest part is being alone! What you need is a night out. It's an answer machine message, not a speech to the United Nations. Miss Sarah! So nice to hear your voice! Yeah, yeah, heard it all before. Stace, I've literally just walked through the door. I'm... exhausted. Stacie, have you ever come back and your washing-up's been done? No... - Stacie, shut up, I'm serious. Well, calm down, you probably did it and forgot about it. Somebody's been in my house. Sarah! Somebody has been in my house. So, this is your problem: you get home and you find out your house has been tidied? Yeah. - Excuse me, I would die for that! Stacie, will you be serious! - I am! It's your round. Look, just listen, I got home... - Not without liquid. You have totally lost the plot. Great. So my best mate thinks I'm crazy? I think you're a complete fruit-bat. Listen, I want you to answer this next question very seriously. -Go on then. Are you taking anything at the moment? - What? No! Well there's your first problem. And when was the last time you had sex? What's your point? - Answer the question. John. You haven't had sex for 5 months? My parents get it more often than that! I think I should go to the police. - So do I. Five months is criminal! Listen, I just want somebody to come to my house. I just want to know for sure that no one has been in my house. I'm not crazy. I know what I saw. - Madam, you have to understand unless you've been threatened or there's any sign of forced entry, there's nothing we can do. There is something you can do, you can work on the fact that I'm stood here. Are you sleeping all right? - Do I look awful? -If you stayed in all night, you'll have your report on the Pomeroy case. - Done. - Really? Let's hope it's more constructive than your last attempt. If I thought it was just nothing, then I wouldn't be here. Shit! - Jen, do you wanna take this call? I can't. I need the Pomeroy file for the Personality of the Century. He is so on my case today. - See you're falling in love then. What'll you do? I can send a crime prevention officer round to check your locks and windows. Excuse me. Hello? Great. "Dear Sarah, when I fall asleep I am no longer afraid. I speak to you all the time, Sarah. I hope that you can hear me. I wonder if I think hard enough, I can talk to you in your dreams. I know how you felt when I saw you in the graveyard. You looked sad. Did you feel that... bug in your stom-ache?" So, you've got Freddy Krueger as an admirer? Yeah. Thanks for staying over. - Stop thanking me. I know David's back. You haven't seen him in a week. It'll do him good to go a night without getting any. Will you be all right on this sofa? You can crash in with me if you like. You may be my friend, but I don't really wanna sleep with you. Look, don't worry, if anyone comes in, I will whack him so hard you can put his head on the mantelpiece. You are sick. - That is why you love me. Night-night. - Night. I don't feel afraid. Alex... Mummy? Where's Mummy? - Mummy isn't here. She can't help you now. Time: 6.15. Get up, get up! Sleep: 5 Hours, 13 minutes. Are you tired? I am. I'm exhausted. You should not be afraid to sleep. That's so sweet! She's ready for you. Alex, how would you feel if I told you you didn't have to come back here? What if I wrote, "We're not making any progress" and I filed that report in your annual assessment? You wouldn't like that, would you, Alex? I've met somebody. - Really? That's good, Alex. - I feel strange. I'm afraid it'll all go wrong. - Of course you are. You're moving into a new social agenda. -It scares me. I don't like feeling scared. -We all feel scared when we meet someone new. It's all down to a matter of romance. I was courting a gentleman called... Frank. No, Gareth. The name's irrelevant. He cooked me a meal. And when you cook someone a meal... Well, let's just say, the easiest way to a woman's heart is through her stomach. Take my advice, cook dinner! Great, yeah, we made real progress today. You're sitting here, you met somebody... Time's up. - I'll see you next Tuesday. Prick! So when exactly did you plan on telling me about this? You've got 60 seconds to explain why you don't wanna work with me any more. I don't think you're right for the job. -What? You've read my file. I finished top of my class! Just because I didn't walk the street for 15 years and don't go "I'm Mr Grump, factor 10" every time I walk into the office, doesn't spell out I can't do my job. - It's your attitude. Attitude? You mean I'm the wrong sex. You can't deal with having a female do your job as well as you and be half your age. Where's your wife and daughter tonight? Look, I know nothing about you, so why presume you know everything about me? You've got to give me a chance. Answer me this: what one thing in your life, is the worst that ever happened to you? How can you do this job without an emotional attachment to the world? You treat being a detective like a part in your own movie. You're in this for the title not the job. You've been here 5 minutes, just got off the bus! My age is not my fault! Age isn't anybody's fault. I'm talking about experience. I'm talking about loss. Suffering. Something you know little about. Don't think much suffering has touched you. I'm talking about damage. The damage people do to each other, what they're capable of inflicting. I've seen damage. I've done damage. It's not easy to live with. It's not easy for a family to live with. They couldn't. So, crime happens. We stop it, or we deal with it. If we get it wrong, damage is what we leave behind. Think you're ready for that? Sarah... Please eat. Please. Please eat... Why won't you eat? Please eat, please! Eat! Please help me, Sarah. No, don't! - Eat, eat... - Help me, Sarah! You can't hide. I can hear you, Alex! Come out, Alex. This is Sarah. I'm not here to take your call. Please leave a message. Thanks. Come on, pick up if you're in. Okay, I'm gonna count to ten. One, two, three, ten! Okay, Sarah, phone me on my mobile. I'll have dinner on my own then. What do we never do, Alex? Never talk, never shout, never scream, never cry. Never talk, never shout, never scream, never cry. Mummy! Help me, Mummy! What do we never do? - Leave Alex alone! It's only a nightmare, Alex. Time: 6.15. Get up, get up! Sleep... 1 Hour, 13 minutes. You can guarantee, when something like this happens, it always rains. I saw her before. At the station. I need some air. - Jen? If you're worried about your job, don't be. Alex, why are you here? You don't have an appointment today. It's Wednesday. - Well, that's my day. Alex, what are you doing here? -It's Wednesday. I'm supposed to be here. No, we always meet on Tuesdays. By the way, how was that dinner? No, never mind, tell me Tuesday. Bye, love. I'm sorry. Sorry? You hurt your hand! - It doesn't hurt. You should let me take a look at it. May I take this off? It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Alex. Help me. "Dear Charlotte, you helped me and I wish I could tell you how I feel inside. When I slept, I didn't want to wake. I thought the feelings may not be there. You have rested my mind and I don't want to be apart from you, ever. I find it hard to say what my body is feeling. I'm so happy. And I know that when I am with you I will never be alone." They found matching metal particles in the locks of both victims' doors. And I've got Sarah's autopsy report. What was the cause of death? - Asphyxiation. They found pseudocin codeine in her blood. It's an immobilising drug. They use it to calm psychiatric patients. It paralyses the muscles, then arrests the vocal chords. She actually died of an allergic reaction which shut down her respiratory system. So, there was never any intention to kill. Her hands and feet were tied together and she was force-fed. Was the most dangerous kind of murderer? A killer who doesn't believe that what they're doing is wrong. It's late, Charlotte. Are you still studying? Yeah, it's the only way I'll ever get my degree. A waste of time. They can't teach you anything. You must think about something else in this job or it'll take over your life. And you don't want a job that ends up killing you. Isn't it all about helping these people, getting them back on the road? There is no road for these people. And if you believe there is, you're naive. You sound pessimistic. I wish I still thought like you do. Bit late now though. Come on. Charlotte. Alex... How did you get in here? Is something wrong? Don't you like me, Charlotte? - You're not supposed to be here. Didn't you like my letter? You have an appointment on Tuesday. I'll see you then. Okay? It's wrong to just come into someone's house. -Why don't you like me? You'd be in big trouble if they knew that you'd been here. Why didn't you like my letter? No, Alex. You have to go. You need to go. Now! You need to get out of here. You have to go now. Get out of my house! I'm calling the police! What emergency service do you require? - The police, please! This the police. What is the nature of your emergency? - I'm being attacked! I'm being attacked! I need you to be with me. ... right in front of me! - Hold me, Charlotte! I need you to be with me. Stop it! - I need you to be with me. Stop! - Hold me, Charlotte. I'm calling the police! Do you hear me? I'm calling the police! Stop it! Hold me, Charlotte. Hello? Gone. No, I'm all right. Any leads from neighbours? - There are no witnesses, the driver saw nothing. Police. Right, through them double doors down there, hook a right, down to the end of the corridor, last room on the left. Inspector. Detective. -Is she awake? - No, sir. Dr Carpenter said she showed signs of coming to, but 15 minutes ago she slipped unconscious. Any indication when she might wake up? - No. -What are her injuries? A major head trauma which might lead to complications if she wakes up. She's pretty lucky, to be honest. It's only a nightmare, Alex. - Why did you lie to me? Hey, Alex... I don't think you appreciate the seriousness of this investigation. We have two dead girls. Your colleague, Charlotte, was lucky not to be number three, and you're throwing bureaucracy at us! This is a highly dangerous individual, who could've been known to Charlotte. You have files. The files have names. You must realize that this individual could be one of your patients. You're asking me to go against all my patient/doctor confidentiality so you can look at my files! The answer is no. I'd be breaking my oath and risking my job. Look, Charlotte is alive. Whoever was responsible for the accident presumes that she's dead. If he finds out that she's not, she could be in real danger. Are you willing to accept responsibility for that? I've got appointments to keep and time is precious to a lady like me, so would you be kind enough to close the door behind you when you leave? Give me the key! I can't do that. And I suggest you leave. Give me the key, or I break into your filing cabinet with your nine iron! Do I detect a threat? - I haven't even started threatening! Inspector! And I thought my patients had problems! Come on. Sorry, I've had the police in. Bad things have been happening. Bad things have been happening. It's quite inconvenient, actually. I've no one to make the tea. No-one to make the tea. I'll be back in a minute. The hardest part is being alone. I love you! Get out of here! - Cook dinner! About time this place had some new blood. D'you want a drink? Silent type. Nice. Kinky. They do say, it's the shy ones, that you have to look out for. Do you want to good news or the bad news? - Try the good. Charlotte's regained consciousness. - And the bad? -She's got amnesia. Suppose our stalker knew that Charlotte was still alive. He wouldn't start looking for another girl, he'd be set on her. -So? We flush him out. I go on the news tonight, explain Charlotte's alive. There's only one place our man'll want to be! What if it goes wrong? You're using her as bait. It won't go wrong. Filth... How far do you want to go? I think it's way past your bedtime. What's bad? - Filth. What must we never be? - Dirty. Who don't we tell, Alex? - Mummy. Feel better? I'll make you feel better. How does this feel? I know where you like it. ... Charlotte's regained consciousness... -Charlotte! You wanna play rough? Rough's good for me. Just depends how much money you've got. - Dirty. Charlotte Green was trying to escape an attacker who broke into her home. She was able to make it to a nearby phone box and call the police, but then ran into the path of an oncoming car. Other than the impact which induced the coma, her injuries are minimal. Inspector Hannah gave the following statement to our reporter: Charlotte is a lucky girl. She has made a full recovery within the last few hours. We're expecting Charlotte to give us a full description of her attacker, whom we suspect to be known to her. It's only a matter of time now, before we're able to identify the suspect. Do you know why you're here? No. I... You remember your name? Do you remember anything else? What happened to me? There was an accident. A car accident? - Yeah. Can you tell me anything about it? Anything at all? Why are you asking me these questions? I'm a police officer. I don't understand. Why are you here? Do you remember what happened before the accident? Do you remember leaving work? I went to college. College? And then what? You went home? Yeah. I ran a bath. I don't think I turned it off. You ran a bath... and then you left your house. Why? Is there anything else you can tell me? There's been a development. One of the offices was broken into. - I'll go and check. - No. You stay here. It's probably nothing. Anything happens, radio me. I'd feel safer with a gun. Hi. Jezebel. Oh yeah, I is well alone tonight. Jen! The computer's been accessed. It's got a schematic showing patients' wards. Jen, stay vigilant. I'm on my way. No! Oh, you filthy whore, that's disgusting. Hold me, Charlotte. It's only a nightmare, Alex.
