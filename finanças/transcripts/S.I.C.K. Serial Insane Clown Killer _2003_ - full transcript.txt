(laughing) - Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I miss you too. Stop. You know I hate it when you do that. Yeah, wait, I got to go. What are you doing, Bill? I thought we talked, I thought we discussed this? What? There's nobody here, if that's what you're thinking. Denise is at school. What's that behind your back? What is it? (sighing) Bill. Damn. You just don't get it, do you? I can't take your games anymore. I can't have you influencing Denise. I don't love you anymore. Ah. What did you do? Ah.. (heavy breathing) Billy? (heavy breathing) Billy, what are you doing? Ah. (flesh tearing) (crying out in pain) Ah.. (cheery music) (phone ringing) - Brandon Walker. Hey Mark. Hey, you're still coming, right? Excellent. Man, we are going to have a blast. Hey, you're still bringing Susan aren't you? No, no, no. Bring her. No, we need her to be there. No, I haven't asked her yet. (chuckling) Well shit, I've been working on her for a while. It's now or never. Well, I tell you what, bring a change of underwear and all that gay porn you've got stashed away at your house. Because if I get shot down this weekend, I swear to God I'm switching teams.

Sorry about that sport. Didn't mean to give you the old heebie-jeebies. Say, you're not doing anything important this weekend are you? - Actually David? I'm going out of town. Didn't I mention that to you? - Ouch. I hate to do this to you, old chum, but we really need an assist on that whole Lipschitz Lipinski deal. - Look, David. I've had these plans for a while now. Come on, man. Can't you do it? - I'd really like to amigo, but I got a prior engagement. (erotic music) I just can't break it. Anyway, Bainbridge would really appreciate it. He asked for you specifically. So I think it'd be in everybody's best interest if you kind of went ahead and came on in this weekend. Okay, compadre? - No. - Excuse me? - I said no, Dave. You do this to me all the time and I'm not going to take it. Not anymore. - Look, buddy. You better think about- - Yeah, I have thought about it, David. All right, now I've had these plans for over a month, and I have got my friends waiting on me, and I am not about to blow them off just because you had your head up your ass again. - You son of a bitch. - Yeah. Have a good weekend, David. You're going to regret this, Walker. Bainbridge asked for you specifically. (suspenseful music) (elevator dinging) (button mashing) - C'mon. (frustrated groaning) (fast-paced piano music) Tracy. Hey, Tracy. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to startle you like that. I have a question to ask you. Brandon? - It's okay. Brandon, calm down. - Okay. Here it goes. Some of my friends and I are going to this little cabin I have on the river, and I wanted to know if you wanted to go with us? - Brandon. We hardly know each other. - Oh, come on Tracy. We've worked together for over a year. Remember the Christmas party? (slow-paced techno music) (laughing) - Stop it. - Santa? - That was you? - Yeah. (laughing) - (sighing) Well, either way, Brandon, I have a boyfriend. But thank you. - I heard you guys broke up. - Oh, really? Where did you hear that? - It was posted on the billboard at work. - Oh really? - Oh really. - I must have missed that. - No, honestly, someone told me that you were available. So I figured, what the hell, take a chance. I certainly didn't mean to put you on the spot. What? - Nothing, it's just that- (suspenseful music) (gasping) (bouncy music) Scott and I actually have decided to give each other some space. - Space? Space is good. So you're going to come then. - Where's this place again? - It's a little place up by the river. My parents used to own it. I used to go there when I was a kid. - What'd you guys do up there? - Well, after the pagan orgy, I feed everybody to a monster in the woods. - So is there going to be any gin at this pagan monster orgy? - All the gin that you can drink. Let me give you my address. - Brandon. I know where you live. - How do you know where I live? - Your costume party? Halloween? I came with Stephanie, remember? (middle eastern music) Yeah? - So hard for me to drink with the teeth. Wait a minute, what was your name? That was you? - See you around 5:45. Maybe. - Maybe? - Maybe. (upbeat music) (car beeping) (upbeat music) (suspenseful humming) (suspenseful humming) (grunting) (chuckling) - Hey man, it's getting late. Where is this Tracy? - Well, she's got two minutes. I guess she bailed. - Let's get going. - Okay. (calming music) Watch out. (door slamming) All right. Away we go. (horn honking) Hey. You guys, she's here. (laughing) - Hey. - Hey, what are you kidding me? (laughing) Oh, I am so glad you showed up. - Oh, am I late? - No. Hey Mark. Kick him to the back. - Okay. - And I will put this in the car. - All right. - And away we go. (energetic music) (eagle screeching) (dog barking) (dog barking) (doors slamming) You guys are going to love this place. (relaxing bar music) - There it is. - Beer? - Beer? - Dude. - Yeah? - Your wife is hot. - Isn't she? - Mmm. Well, hello. My name's Sophia. What's yours? - Mark. And this is Brandon. - Well hello, Mark and Brandon. - Are you our waitress? - No but, uh, I can satisfy any of your hungers. (upbeat music) (laughing) - Excuse me. You're sitting in my seat. - Tracy, this is Sophia. Sophia, this is Tracy. She is my date for the weekend. - Hm. Hi boys. Well, if y'all get bored with the weekend, y'all know where to find me. (laughing) - What? - What? - C'mon. - What? What was that? - Yeah. - What can I get you? - Can we get four beers please? - Three beers and an ice tea. - Three cold ones and a tea on the rocks. - So Susan, how exactly did you and Mark meet? (church organ music) (moaning) (car squeaking) - Church. - You jerk. - [Tracy] Oh that poor girl. - She only looks about 18. - That poor thing, she looks hurt. - We should go talk to her. - [Tracy] Yeah. - Can I get y'all anything else? - No. - 10 bucks says we're taking her with us. - No fucking way. - Thanks. I'll just stay tonight. I'll hit the road tomorrow. - Whatever (slow-paced mysterious music) (laughing) So, Debbie. - Denise. - Denise. What exactly happened with you and that guy back there? - You mean George? What a sick freak. He just picked me up hitchhiking. I rode with him for like six hours when we stopped at that road house. I was going to go soon, as soon as he let me off. But I decided to wait until I got some food in me, you know? He had been trying to touch me the whole time. - Oh, you nasty little doublet, I just want you to come back to my truck with me. - I nearly choked. I wanted out of there right then, but I thought, where the hell am I going to go? (laughing) So I'm scarfing my food, looking around for a back door or anything. And that's when he blurts out: "I want to suck your toes." - Yeah, I just want to suck your toes till you call me daddy. Daddy. Daddy. - That's when I hit him. - Jerk. (suspenseful music) Thank God you guys were there. - He wanted to suck your toes? - Yeah. He wanted to suck my toes. - Men are pigs. - [Susan] Really. (laughing) - Easy now ladies. Hey, I may be a pig, but I've never wanted to suck anyone's toes. - I just hope that sick freak didn't follow us. - What do you mean? - When I got to Biloxi, and you know, he picked me up. I started to remember seeing him. I kept asking him, you know, where he was headed and can never get a straight answer. He just kept dodging the question. It was really creepy. (suspenseful music) - So Susan, how long have you and Mark been married? - We've been together about five years now. - [Tracy] Hey, would you put that in the fridge for me? - Sure. - Um... So are you guys going to have kids? - Mark is a kid. Don't get me wrong, I love him. But I do everything in the morning except get him dressed. - Ew, my mom used to say that about my dad. - Mine too. You just don't think it's going to happen though, until it's too late. - Would you change your mind If you could take it back? - I never thought of it like that. It's a good question. But no, I'd marry him again. I love him, like I said, but it's no picnic. So Tracy, how long have you been going out with Brandon anyway? - Oh, this is actually the first time. - Really? Well, how long have you known him? - We've known each other about a year. - So do you guys work together? - Well, we work for the same company. - So what do you think about him? - Yeah, is he good in bed? - I wouldn't know. So what about you, Denise? - How about what? - Do you have a boyfriend? - Not anymore. - What happened? - Have you ever had the feeling that the guys you're with, just really didn't give a shit about you? - Yes. - Yes. (drinks clinking) - Thanks. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Thanks. - So Tracy, do you smoke pot? - Oh, I used to in college, but I mean not much anymore. - I love getting high, but I can't roll worth a shit. - Don't worry, I've got you covered. - That's what I love about you, baby. You've got your priorities straight. - Damn straight. - Hey, have you guys heard the ghost story about the wife who tells her husband never to take off her scarf? - Oh please. Not that one. - That's an old one. - Well fuck, Mark, why don't you tell a ghost story? - No fucking way, Mark. Don't. - Oh, come on. I want to hear one. No, you don't. Trust me. - There's the one about the four people that went to a cabin in the woods. (laughing) - Oh, geez. - Oh man, that's horrible. - God. - Hey, hey, hey. There is the one about the insane maniac that escapes from an asylum on the same weekend that this high school couple is on their first date. - Oh my gosh, yeah, and his hand gets caught in the door. And then when, it's just a hook hanging there. - You've heard it? - Yeah. - I think we've all heard it. - [Denise] Well, I don't have a story, but I have a great idea for a horror movie. - Like Friday the 13th or like Scream? - Friday the 13th. Definitely. - Tell it. - Okay. It's about a clown. (nursery music) (whimpering and crying) - Oh no, no, no, no, no. I hate clowns. I hate them. Fuck it, I'm going to get more beer. - Anyways. There's a small town where kids are disappearing. Little kids, like five and six years old. (child laughing) (woman shivering) People were freaking out. The whole area is on alert. And there's this guy who lives by the river. He's a big guy, like 350 pounds. And he's a real loner. Keeps to himself mostly. And you know, he doesn't really bother anyone. He does charity work at the hospital. - Charity work? - Yeah. He visits sick kids and dresses up like a clown. - Oh, I know where this is going. - Yeah. Anyways, so one day this rich couple whose kid has been sick in the hospital, ask the clown to come and entertain at her fifth birthday party. So he comes in his clown outfit, does his thing. Everybody loves him and he leaves. But that night he comes back to the little girl's window and gets her to open it. Her parents find her room empty the next morning. - I knew it. - Yeah. Well then the cops find a giant shoe print near the little girl's window the next day. - Oh geeze. - [Denise] So the cops, thinking it's the clown, takes him in for questioning. - This is a fucked up movie. - Yeah. Although the guy was there during the day, they can't convict him. So they have to let him go, even though they knew he did it. - That sucks. - Yeah. The parents were pissed. The father puts together this little posse, they go to the dude's house, and they get him. - What do they do to him? - They take him out to the woods. - Come on. (men talking) - Tie him to a tree. - Get up there. - And they beat him to death. (groaning) (loud ringing) - You want to be a clown? (bones crunching) (nursery music) (loud ringing) (sighing) - End of movie? - No. One of the posse can't live with the guilt, and confesses. - Okay, lead the way. - He takes the cops to the tree. - He's right here, he's on this tree. It's this one here. (groaning) - But there's nothing there. - What do you mean there's nothing there? - There's no one there. - Yeah, right. - Hey, where you going? I'm not lying, he was here. We gotta do something, he was here. - So the cops go to the clown's house, looking for a sign of struggle. - Nothing again, right? This story sucks. - Well, it's just an idea. - The girl's father could have hidden her body to cover the crime. - Oh, right. The cops could go to the parents house. - And they could find the parents dead. Whoever killed them tied them to chairs, sat them down at the kitchen table, and fed them dinner. - [Susan] Fed them dinner? - Yeah. The clown could feed the little girl to her parents. (everyone groaning) - Oh my God. - The cops could find the little girl in the kitchen, gutted like an animal, and roasted. (laughing) The clown fed them their little girl. - That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard. (laughing) (suspenseful music) - Ah, Jesus Chr- You're an asshole, I'm out of here. - Nice one. - [Brandon] Oh, shit. - Run to her, Romeo. Do you guys wanna hear the rest of the movie? - No. - No more. - What? The scary part's next. But I've got to pee. - Tracy, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have scared you like that. - No, it's okay. I should probably be able to take it. God, I probably look pretty ridiculous, huh? - No, no. If anybody looks ridiculous, (sighing) it's me. Look, I promise you. I give you my word. I am not going to play any more games for the rest of this weekend. But on Monday, all bets are off. - (laughing) Thanks. I guess I'm just a little nervous. - Hey, not to change the subject or anything, but can you tell me how in the hell I can work with you for a year and not ask you out on a date? - Oh, here we go. - What? - Oh, the old Brandon Walker charm I've heard so much about. You have no idea how much women talk, do you? Do you realize that I've heard about you from several other coworkers? (laughing) What? - You know what your problem is, baby? - No. - You're tense. - No I'm not. - Too tense. Come here. - What are you doing? - I'm going to give you a back rub. Oh, that's... I'm going to give you a massage, first class. (laughing) - So why did you guys bring this Denise chick along? - You got a problem with it? - Maybe. - I'll bet you do. - And what does that mean? - What does that mean? - You brought her. - It was Tracy's idea. - Oh yeah? (laughing) - Well we couldn't just leave her there. She's a kid, you know? - She seems pretty grown up to me. - Oh she does, does she? - Fuck yes. She's got it going on. - "She's got it going on," does she? (laughing) - What are you, a fucking parent? (laughing) - Oh. - And finally, this last region of nervousness is just about gone. (moaning) Of course we will have to continue this later. You want to go back outside? - They're adults. Why don't we let them fend for themselves? - Oh, Tracy. I do like the way you think. (suspenseful music) - So baby, how long have you known Brandon? - We went to school together. A pretty long damn time, I guess. - I've never heard you talk about him before. - I hadn't really thought about him since we graduated from college. - So you weren't that close? - We played ball together. I knew him pretty well, I suppose. As well as I knew anybody. Man, he sure fucked up with Tracy. (laughing) - I don't know about that, baby. - What do you mean? - Well, where are they? (calming music) - So what you're saying is that they are in there right now on top of each other? - I don't know about that. - That's what you said. - That's not what I said. (suspenseful music) This is a getting-to-know-you trip anyway. - Getting-to-know-you? (laughing) That's ridiculous. She's obligated to have sex with him now. - That's not going to work, Mark. - What? - Trying to piss me off. - All right. I just wanted to see if I can get a rise out of you. Hey, I have an idea. - What? - Let's go inside and see if you can get a rise out of me. (laughing) - Lead the way, stud. - Where did what's-her-name go? - Denise? - Yeah. - I don't know, she's probably sleeping. I'm freezing. C'mon, Let's go. - Okay. (laughing) - Okay. Okay. (laughing) - You silly guy, stop. (laughing) (nursery music) (floor creaking) (suspenseful tone) (yelping) - Thirsty? Me too. Do you mind? Hey Tracy? - [Tracy] Yeah? - Thanks for picking me up. I know Brandon didn't particularly want to. - [Tracy] No problem. (suspenseful music) - [Mysterious Voice] Susan? Susan? - Mark? Mark, did you hear that? (sighing) (suspenseful music) (door creaking) (heavy breathing) (floor creaking) (music growing louder) (muffled screaming) (dramatic tone) - Whoa, you scared the shit out of me. What are you doing up? - Couldn't sleep. Got a problem? - Sorry. - Want a cigarette? - Sure. - So where's what's-her-name? - What's-her-name is asleep. (muffled screaming) (suspenseful music) - What was that? - I don't know. I'll go check it out. (laughing) No, no, no, no, no. I can't do this. - It's a secret. Come on Brandon, don't you want me? Nobody has to know. (energetic rock music) Tomorrow is no different, do you understand? (kissing) (dramatic organ music) (organ music stops) (yawning) - Good morning. How'd you sleep? - Oh, great. It is so good to be away from the city. - City? We're 12 miles away from civilization. You guys want breakfast? How about pancakes? - [Mark] What else you got? (yawning) - We brought some eggs and juice. (suspenseful music) Brandon, what the fuck is this? - [Denise] What the hell? - What the fuck? - You tell us Brandon, it's your house. - You will regret this. - What does that mean? - Tell us this is your idea of a joke. - Me? - Like I said, it's your house. - Dude, I have no idea what this is about. - Then who the hell does? - Yeah, if you didn't do it, who did? - This is not funny. - It's kind of funny. - No, it is not. - Come on, Mark, this is right up your alley. Tell us you did this. - This isn't fucking funny, and I didn't do it. - Denise, did you do this? Be honest. - I didn't do it, but I knew who did. - Who? - It must be George. That's sick toe-sucking freak followed us up here, I just know it. - I guess sex on the first date is out. - I've had enough. - Oh, come on Tracy, wait a minute. - Wait, where's Susan? - She's probably recovering from your giant dick. (sighing) I know it'd take me a week. - [Brandon] Tracy, what are you doing? Why are you freaking out? - Look Brandon. I don't know what's going on here, but I'm not about to stay in a house where somebody thinks that this kind of shit is funny. I'm scared, and I want to go home now. - Brandon, Tracy, I can't find Susan. Do you guys have any idea where she might be? (suspenseful music) - Maybe the boogeyman got her. Woo. - Don't fuck with me, understand? - Look, Brandon. I want you to get in that car and take me home now. - Okay? I just think you're overreacting. - We need to find my wife now. - Okay, Mark. Now what's wrong? - This is what's wrong. - [Denise] She's walking. - What? - She got up early and she went for a walk. I saw her go toward the river. - You guys, we've got like a thousand acres of woods and if she's lost... Look Tracy, can we look for Susan first? And then I promise you, I will take you home. - (sighing) Fine. (suspenseful music) - She's been gone for at least an hour. - Okay, Mark. I'm sure she went out exploring and she probably got lost. - Thanks. (screaming) - What the hell was that? - Look, everybody just stay calm. - What the fuck was that? Have you ever heard anything like that? - Never. Tracy? Let's go find Susan. - Oh, that's okay. You guys go ahead, I'm going to stay here. - I'd like it if you go with us. - I don't want to. - Well, you may be able to be of some help. - Look, Brandon, I don't like the woods. I'd rather not, okay? - I would appreciate it if you would go. - Well I feel safer here. - I have to find my wife. Let her stay. (screaming and loud bang) - Okay, I'll go. - Look, let's just analyze the situation, okay? Susan got up this morning early, and she took a walk, and she probably got lost. There's plenty of places out there to go exploring, and plenty of ways to get mixed up on the trails, okay? It is no big deal. - Okay What about the dolls in the refrigerator? - What about them? - It's a unnerving, that's what. My wife is missing. We find a headless doll in the fridge, and now Cujo's out here in the woods. - Tracy, would you go get Denise? - Denise? - That bitch gives me the creeps. - Tracy? - No, Denise. - She's not here. - What do you mean, "she's not here."? - I mean, she's not in the fucking house, Brandon. - She's gone too. - Great. (birds chirping) - [Tracy] Denise? Oh my God, Brandon. This is just getting too weird. What the fuck is going on? - Okay, Brandon, this has gone too far. I want to go find my wife and get the hell out of here. - Me too. - You guys, I swear to God, I have no idea what's going on. - I'm sorry we ever picked her up. - She is nothing but trouble, man. (nursery music) - So what you're trying to say is, is that she's a serial killer, is that it? - [Tracy] Did you guys see her eyes when she was telling that ghost story? I'm telling you she's a nutcase. (dramatic tones) - Hell yes, she is. - Look, call it woman's intuition or whatever you want. But I'm telling you she's crazy. Look at the dolls. Why the dolls? (suspenseful tones) And the laughing, (laughing) and now she's missing. And that animal noise in the woods. Why is she never around when any of this creepy shit happens? - Oh, I get it. So what you're saying is, she's out in the woods right now, making noises, is that it? That's good, Tracy. - No, Brandon, what I'm trying to tell you is that the bitch is nothing but trouble. - Oh come on, Tracy. - Look, don't talk to me. - In a forest, 12 miles from nowhere, strange noises, dolls without heads. What's next? Man, I've got to find my wife and get somewhere that has some sanity to it. - Mark, will you settle down? We're looking for her. (shouting) Susan? The first time I came up here, I think I spent six hours out here just looking around. - You get lost? - No, no. I was just looking around and stuff. You know, you get caught up. Careful. - You looking for me? - Nice doll. - You think so? I found it under the bed. I was going to show it to Mark, but he fucking attacked me. - Shut the fuck up. - What is she talking about? - Tell him. - Who cares what he did? You probably deserved it. - You got a problem with me? - Yeah. - [Brandon] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Cut the crap, girls. Let's go find Susan. - Bitch. Remember, I told you, she went for a walk. Said she'd be gone about an hour or so. Told me that she was taking a walk to think about things. - When was this? Why didn't you tell me earlier? What did she say? - I'll let her tell you. - Bullshit, tell me what she said. - She said that marriage isn't all it's cracked up to be. - Bullshit. - Don't believe me then. - Why would we believe you? Like his wife is going to tell a perfect stranger That kind of crap. - Truth hurts. - So Denise, did you see which way she went? - That way. - I'm off. Brandon, are you coming? - Whoa, Mark. We don't know how long she's going to be out there, okay? I say we go back to the house, we fill canteens up with water, and we come back and we do this right. Okay? - [Mark] Okay. - Come on. - Hey Brandon, did you hear that weird noise? - Yeah. Why? - Because I was having a cigarette and before I heard the noises, I thought I heard someone talking. Were you guys in the woods already? - Are you sure it was cigarettes you were smoking? - That was probably nothing. - Maybe, but the noises were definitely real. - [Mark] What's that for? - [Brandon] What do you think it's for? - [Mark] You think there's something out there? - No, but if there is, we're prepared. Do you girls want to stay here at the house? - No way. - No way. Let's just leave her a note. - Carry this. - You don't think anything happened to her, do you? - No. I think she went out there and she got lost. Something captured her attention. - Hey, do you guys think that I should bring my cell phone? - No, the cell phones don't work here. Okay, Denise, which way did she go? - That way. - Okay, let's go. (adventurous music) - Well, keep your eyes peeled for Susan. Or any signs that she may have been through here. - Hold on, I gotta pee. I'll catch up with you. - God damn it, Denise. - Hey, I gotta go. - Well, you better hurry. - She's nuts. - [Brandon] Base. - Yeah, no shit. - Well, hold on. We better wait for her. - I don't think we should let her out of our sight. - Don't worry. - I'm already worried. - Feel better? - Yeah, but look what I found. - That's a piece of Susan's robe. (yelling) Susan? Susan? (nursery music) (muffled crying) (heavy breathing) - [Clown] How much wood could a wood chuck chuck, if a wood chuck could chuck wood? (clown bellowing) - Where the hell is she? Brandon, you brought us up here. If anything happens to her... - Mark, stop it. - Kick his ass, Mark. - Look, Mark. This is not helping, and it's certainly not going to help us find Susan. - Look, Mark. We're all out here looking for hey, okay? Why don't you just calm down? - It's your fault. - He's right. You're the one that brought us here. - Look you fucking bitch, you keep your fucking mouth shut. Do you understand me? - You son of a bitch. - Nobody hits me. Nobody. - What the hell is wrong with you, Brandon? - I have had it with with her shit. You brought this fucking cunt along, not me. And if you know where Susan is, you tell us right now. - Fuck you. - Oh, fuck me? Well, fuck you. - Brandon. Look, I think we all need to go back and call the police. Okay? (screaming) - Oh my God. - Holy shit. - [Denise] It's him. - [Tracy] It's who? - George. - Who the fuck is George? - The guy I hitched a ride with. He was following me, I know it. Yo, we've got to get out of here. - Look, I want to go back and call the police right fucking now. (man screaming) - Who is that? (man screaming) You're on private property. Hey, Tracy's right. Let's go back to the house right now and call the police. (dramatic tone) (carnival music) (heavy breathing) (muffled crying) (heavy breathing) (Susan whimpering) (suspenseful music) I'm going to go call the sheriff. - Hey, the note I left is gone. Great. She's always doing stuff like that. She probably found her way back. Susan? Jesus. What is this? Brandon, come here. Call the cops, man. Denise must've been telling the truth about that guy. He's fucking with us. - I can't. - Holy shit. - Brandon, seriously, call the cops. We need some help. - I said I couldn't. - Why not? - The phone's dead. - Oh bullshit. (suspenseful music) Crap. Give me the keys to the fucking car, I'm going to get some help. - He's going to kill us all one by one. - I told you she trouble. - [Mark] Brandon, the keys. - I gotta find them. - Tracy, what about your cell phone? - Oh. - Try it. God, please try it. - [Brandon] No service. I could have told you that. - You better find those fucking keys. - [Tracy] Oh shit. - Here they are. - [Tracy] We'll get some people up here to help us find Susan. - [Denise] It's too late, he's already killed her. - [Mark] Shut up, Denise. - [Denise] You'll be next, asshole. Then Tracy, then Brandon, then finally me, I just know it. - What the fuck are you talking about? - I knew he was bad news, but I never thought this was going to happen. He's going to kill us all. - [Tracy] Brandon, get her away from me now. - Stop it. Let's get out of here before he does kill somebody. The quicker we get somebody out here, the quicker we'll find Susan. (engine stuttering) - [Mark] Now what? Come on, Brandon, don't flood it. - Dammit. (dramatic tone) - [Tracy] What the hell was that? Fuck. (scoffing) - God dammit. We're not going anywhere. - It's him. He's fucked with the car. - Will you shut up? - What's wrong? The distributor wire. Someone's fucked with the distributor wires. That car's not going to start. - [Denise] I told you. - This is all your fault, you little bitch. - You're the one who wanted to bring her along. - Oh, fuck off, Mark. - Yeah, fuck you too. - Come on, that's not going to help anything. - What are we going to do? - Well first off, there is four of us. And I have a gun and I will not hesitate to use it. - Maybe we should just walk to the highway. - No, no, no, no. It's 12 miles to the nearest highway and it's going to be dark in two hours. No way. Wait a minute. My uncle used to keep tractors up here, and he'd keep all the tractor parts and spare wires in the shed. Maybe he still has some in there. (keys jingling) Mark, would you go to the back of my truck and get the tire iron? (suspenseful music) Oh, fuck me. - Oh my- (coughing) Oh my God, Brandon, what the hell is that? - [Mark] This is bullshit. - [Denise] It looks like some sort of ritualistic shit. Brandon, what the hell? You said this was your family's place? What did you do? - Oh, we're fucked. - Brandon, what is this? - Look, I don't know what it is. Jesus Christ, I've never... I don't know. - It's George. When are you guys going to start believing me? I'm telling you it's him. - It can't be, Denise. Those people must have been... (muffled crying) killed before. - I'm telling you- - Oh, pull your head out of your ass, Denise. What are you saying? Are you saying that some guy knew you were coming here to this place? And so he went back into time and killed those people? - I know it sounds crazy, but I'm telling you the truth. (coughing) - They're not there. - What? - [Brandon] The tractor parts, the car parts, the distributor cap. They're not there. - Okay, Brandon, look, this is just getting to be too much. Okay? I want to go in the house, lock the doors and I want to to get the hell out of here first thing in the morning. - Okay, okay. - Okay? - Can you guys come over here for a minute? - I'm going to go look for my wife. Does anybody want to come? - [Denise] I'll go. - [Tracy] Do you guys really think we should be splitting up? - We're staying here for the night, right? - Yeah. - I want to go look one more time before it gets dark. - All right, Tracy and I are going to stay here in the house. - Fine. - I'm so scared, Brandon. - Look, it's going to get dark soon and it could be a long night. (mysterious music) - (yelling) Susan? Susan? - This is fucked. (wood chopping) Do you hear that? - What is that? - I don't know. (wood chopping) It could be coming from pretty far away. - (yelling) Susan? - I'm tired. - Me too. Denise, tell me about this guy that picked you up. Why do you think he's following you? - No, I just said that to fuck with Tracy and Brandon. They piss me off. That's why I wanted to come with you so I can tell you that. I know you're getting upset. - Fucking A, I'm upset. - Mark, it's going to be okay. (wood chopping) There's that noise again. (wood chopping) Sounds like wood being chopped. - Did Susan really say those things to you? (suspenseful music) - Do you really think that guy could have followed Denise? - No, it doesn't add up. - What do you mean? - Well, let's think about it. Susan gets up this morning to take a walk, and Denise is the last one to talk to her? - Well, she claims she was. - Right. And then we find a doll in the refrigerator, and Denise has a big laugh about it. - And the note was crumpled up, and the clothes were laid out on the bed. And she was the last one to go inside to use the bathroom before we went to look for Susan. - Hold on, I gotta pee. I'll catch up with you. - Yeah, but she didn't have time to cut the phone cord and play with the car. - Yeah, you're right. It doesn't add up. (wood chopping) - You guys been having problems? - Some. Things have gotten pretty fucked up with us. (wood chopping) - I'm really sorry, Mark. - She really told you she needed to do some thinking? - Yeah. That means something to you? - Well, she's been thinking about leaving me. She suggested an open marriage. - So in other words, she wants permission to fuck other guys? (wood chopping) - Exactly. - Mark, you deserve a lot better than that. (wood chopping) (dramatic music) (wood chopping intensifies) - ♪ Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall ♪ ♪ Humpty Dumpty had a great fall ♪ ♪ And all the king's horses ♪ ♪ and all the king's men ♪ ♪ couldn't put Humpty together again ♪ (suspenseful tones) (suspenseful music) - [Tracy] I swear, this place gives me the creeps, Brandon. You sure we're going to be safe here all night? - [Brandon] Yeah. I just wish Mark and Denise would get back. Hey, my uncle used to keep a CB radio here for emergencies. - Well, what are we waiting for? - I don't know. - Let's go. - I'm going to go check the back room. - I'll go check the kitchen. - [Clown] ♪ Ring around the rosey ♪ ♪ Pocket full of posy ♪ ♪ Ashes, ashes ♪ ♪ We all fall down ♪ (clown laughing) - Did that help? We'd better head back to the house before it gets dark. - I really want to look a little longer. You can go back. - All right, fine. We'll look for like 10 more minutes and then we'll head back. Let's go this way. - Susan would have stayed on the path. We'll cover more ground if we split up anyway. - What a dick. - Are you scared to go by yourself? - No. (nursery music) (adventurous music) - Jackpot. Let's hope this works. Will you go plug that in? - [Tracy] Yeah. (radio static) - [Brandon] Kick-ass. This is Brandon Walker. We are stranded at the Walker place on county road, 34, near Cool Springs. Do you copy? (radio static) This is Brandon Walker. We are stranded at the Walker place on county road, 34, just South of Cool Springs. Do you copy? (radio static) - Help, this is an emergency. Is anybody out there? (radio static) Please help, this is an emergency. We need help immediately. Is anybody out there? (radio static) Dammit. - [Radio] Copy that. We hear your distress signal. Can you give the location again? - Yes we copy. This is Brandon Walker, on county road, 34, just South of Cool Springs. It's an emergency, you need to send help. - [Radio] You're breaking up pretty badly. Can you repeat what you've said? Over. - We are stranded at the old Walker place on county road, 34, South of Cool Springs. Do you copy? - [Radio] County road 44, over. - County road, 34. - [Radio] County road, 34. The old Walker place. We've got it. We will send help, sit tight. (flies buzzing) (suspenseful music) - (yelling) Susan? Susan? Susan? (heavy breathing) Susan? (heavy breathing) (light piano music) (heavy breathing) (crickets chirping) (heavy breathing) (suspenseful music) (flies buzzing) (intense dramatic music) (gagging) (carnival music) Susan? Where have you been? Susan, I've been looking all over for you. Susan? Oh my God! No. No. Susan. No. (clown laughing) (dramatic music) - [Tracy] Where's Mark? - Mark killed her. Susan. She's dead. - You're a liar. - No, I'm telling the truth. I saw her, he chopped her head off. He chopped her head off. - [Brandon] Who? - Mark. It was like he didn't want me to find her. - [Mark] Susan. Don't fuck with me. Jesus. - He chopped her head off. - Nuh-uh. He wouldn't do that. - I don't believe that Mark would kill his own wife. Brandon? - Nuh-uh. No way, he couldn't do it. - Did you know they were having problems? Did you know that she wanted to leave him? - When did he tell you that? - He told me that she wanted to leave him. She wanted to split up. - When did he tell you that? - This afternoon. - Oh, so one minute it's George, and the next it's Mark. Come on, Denise. - That was before I saw the look in Mark's eyes. Besides, I really didn't think it was George. - [Tracy] What? - I'm an idiot. I thought we were going to go out there and find her. I thought she was just lost in the woods. I didn't know he was going to kill her. - Okay. So which story are we supposed to believe? The one now or the one before? And Susan's out there dead? You show us. - Okay, look, this time I'm telling the truth. No shit, Susan is dead. Mark killed her. When are you guys going to start believing me? He killed her. How do we know that you didn't kill her and Mark? How do we know that you aren't trying to lure us out there so you can kill us too? - Where is Mark, Denise? Uh-huh, yeah. I think you should sit down in this chair right now. Go. - Come on, Brandon. Don't do this. - Tracy. There's some rope in the kitchen drawer. Top one on the right. Go get it please. - You're making a big mistake. - Uh-huh? - I'm going to tell her what you did to me. - Oh no, you're not. Here, take this. Hold it on her. If she moves, shoot her. - No, come on. Don't do this to me. (gun clicking) - This is for your protection as well as ours, Denise. - But you have the gun. You yourself said we should stay together. One against four, remember? - Yeah, well, I don't trust you anymore. Okay. I'm going to go look for Mark. You stay here and keep an eye on her. The Sheriff should be here any minute. (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) (Mark panting) (heavy breathing) (crickets chirping) - Listen, Tracy. I didn't kill anybody. - I didn't say that you did. But you know what? You're a fucked up little bitch. And until this situation is straightened out, you're staying right there. - I'm telling the truth now. I didn't kill anybody. - You know, what about Brandon? How well do you know him? It's his family's place and there are bodies all over the fucking place, for Christ sakes. Who do you think did that? - I know him. - Do you? - That's what I said. - Do you know that I fucked him? - You know, you're lying. I know what you're trying to do here, and you're not going to get away with it. You don't know him that well, do you? Look, I know that Brandon wouldn't have killed all of those people. Besides, I was with him when he called the sheriff. - Oh, how'd he do that? With a secret phone? - No, we found a CB radio. - Pull your head out of your ass. This whole thing is a set up to get us all killed. Like the people in the shed. Explain that. Do you think I did that? When? Who do you think did it, Tracy? Brandon did. Did you fuck Brandon last night? I did. - You're a fucking liar. - Did he make that little noise when he came for you? That high-pitched little moan? (high-pitched moan) Yeah, thought so. (crickets chirping) - [Brandon] Give me the gun. - Why? - [Brandon] What? Give me the gun. Denise, what exactly did you and Mark see out there? - We decided to separate to look for Susan. (nursery music) And I came to this area that had dolls hanging from the trees. (suspenseful music) like the dolls in the shed. And I turned around, and I saw Mark standing over Susan's body under the tree. He chopped her head off. - You're a fucking liar. - Where's the sheriff? - What are you doing now? - I'm untying her. She's not going anywhere. It's dark out there. - [Radio] Hello, this is the sheriff. Is anyone out there? Hello, sheriff here. Do you copy? - We didn't copy that last statement. Over. - [Radio] Are these the people out near Cool Springs that are having all the trouble? I need your location again. - County road, 34, just South of Cool Springs. Do you copy? - [Radio] Can't get a unit there right now. There's been a rollover on the highway. - [Brandon] Wait, it's an emergency. There may have been some people killed, and some people are missing. Please send someone now. Do you copy? (radio static) - What now? - We have to go outside and we have to find Mark. - I'm not going out there, I'm staying put. You heard the cops. They'll be here as soon as they can. - By then we could all be dead. - Look, Denise. Nothing is going to happen to us as long as we stick together, and we have protection. - Shoot me, I'm not going anywhere. (dramatic music) (door rattling) (knocking on door) - (gun clicking) Get it. - You're not going to believe this. - [Tracy] Oh my God. Oh my God. - Is he dead? - I don't know. - [Tracy] Oh my God. - Shut up, Tracy. - [Tracy] We have to get out of here. We're all going to die. - He's dead. - Oh my God, we're all going to die. - Will you shut the fuck up? (Tracy squealing) (knocking on door) - This is some fucked up shit right here. - [Tracy] Don't get it. - Who is it? - [Man Behind Door] Son, it's the sheriff. Open the door. - [Tracy] Oh, thank God. - No, wait a minute. Think. - [Tracy] Open it. - What if it's not the sheriff? - Uh, sir. Could you please come to the window and show us your badge? - [Man Behind Door] Okay, son, open the door. You know I've got other things to do today. - Open the mother fucking door. - Look, you stupid bitch. If it's a cop, we'll find out in a minute. If not, we don't open the door. - Look, sir, we've been attacked tonight and I'm sure you're going to understand, when it's all said and done, but right now we need you to come to the window and let us make sure. - [Man Behind Door] All right, have it your way. - Tracy, go to the fucking window and look. - I can't see. - [Denise] What is it? (dramatic music) - [Tracy] Oh my God. - [Clown] Hi. Open the God damn door. (girls screaming) - I have a gun. - [Clown] Well, why don't you stick the gun up your ass? (banging on door) Welcome to hell, mother fucker. (gun shooting) - [Tracy] What happened? - Did I get him? - [Tracy] I don't know. - Well go fucking look. - Nothing. - Tracy? - [Tracy] I don't know, I don't see anything. What are we going to do? - I say we make a stand right here. - [Tracy] Oh my God. (sobbing) Oh my God. - [Brandon] Tracy? Tracy. Tracy, Tracey, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look, look, look. This is my fault. I got you into this and I am going to get you out. Do you understand that? (Tracy crying) Shh... - Not if you keep hugging each other. - Oh, fuck you. - No, she's right, Brandon. We have to get started. - Right, okay. Too many fucking windows up here, so I say we block off a section in the back, - Block it off with what? - We've got boards all over here. Come on, come on. - What are we going to do about Mark? - [Brandon] There's nothing we can do for him now. Come on, go. (upbeat music) All right. Put this board up. Oh, geez. What are you going to do with that? - I'm going to be ready for that mother fucker. (suspenseful music) (light switching) (women screaming) Hey shut up, quiet. He just cut the electricity. I've got a flashlight. Are you okay? - [Denise] Yeah. - [Brandon] Are you okay? - [Tracy] Yeah. - [Brandon] Hey, come here, I have some candles over here. Hold that. (mysterious music) (footsteps) (knocking on door) - What was that? - He's in the house. - Fuck this. I'm ready to go on the attack. - No. - It might be our only chance of getting out of here alive. - But we don't know what's out there. - I know what's out there. A fucking psychopath. - Hey. We don't go out there and fight something until we don't have a choice. She's right. We don't know what's out there. - All right, then what? (sighing) - I've got to go for help. - Brandon, no. You said it yourself, we're 12 miles away from anything. - Look, I don't have a choice. - How long would it take you? - I don't know. 15 minutes a mile, times 12, three hours? - There's no way. - Look, I don't have a choice, Tracy. - He's right. Getting help is the only chance we've got. - Well, how are you going to get out? (suspenseful music) - Create a diversion. We make enough noise to draw his attention, and then we get one of the doors open, and then I make a run for it. - But we don't know how many of them there are out there. - There's only one out there. - How do you know? - Because two doors haven't rattled at the same time. - That's right. Oh look, fuck this. I mean, we can sit here and argue all night, but at some point I've got to make a break for it. - Brandon, no, please don't do this. - Look, Tracy, I have to. Okay. Here's what we're going to do. Denise, be ready to open that door. Okay, Tracy, When I give you the nod, you rattle this and caused the distraction. And you, you make sure that you're ready to open that door. - Okay. - Take this. - You may need it out there. - Now look, once I get out you lock this door, and no matter what happens, you do not open it. - Don't worry about us. We'll be fine. You just run like hell. - Don't worry, I will. Here. - Careful Brandon. - Oh, I will. - Oh, God. (rattling door) (suspenseful music) (footsteps) (Tracy screaming) (door rattling) - Open it. (clown laughing) - [Clown] Oh please, oh please. Let me come in. Or I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow the house in. (clown laughing) (nursery music) (Brandon panting) - What if he doesn't make it? - We fight. - I guess we have no choice. - Here. - Great. Some weekend. - (scoffing) Yeah, some weekend. (dramatic music) (women screaming) (door rattling) - Get ready, Tracy, I need you. - Why don't you leave us alone? - It's okay, Tracy, calm down. - I can't take this anymore. - Calm down. - Why don't you just do what you're going to do? (Tracy crying) (clown laughing) (women screaming) - Oh my God. Shit. - It's okay, it's gone now. - Oh my God. - What? - This means there are two of them. What If Brandon doesn't make it? - We don't know that Brandon didn't make it. - But what if he doesn't? What are we going to do? What are we going to do now? What are we going to do? - Can it, look. We've got to stick together, okay? Our only chance is sticking together. - Oh God. You hurt me. - I'm sorry, but you're acting like a fucking idiot. - I'm sorry. I guess I'm just not used to being trapped in a secluded house, with a fucking psychopath. - Me neither. - Okay. Fuck it. Come first light, we're going out that door and dealing with whatever's out there. I can't take it in this room much longer. If we get it, we get it. - Okay. It's going to be light soon. (birds chirping) (calming music) (Tracy groaning) - What happened? - Nothing, you fell asleep. - What time is it? - I don't know, around six. Do you still want to go out? - What do you think? - I asked you first. - Yeah, I do. - Me too. - Have you gotten any sleep at all tonight? - No. - Why don't we give Brandon like, an hour? - He's not coming, believe me. - How do you know that? - Take this. - I have to go to the bathroom. - Leave the door open. (door slamming) (suspenseful music) (Denise screaming) - [Denise] Help. Tracy, help. - Denise? Denise? (Denise screaming) Denise? Open the door. (door opening) Brandon, oh my God. - Shh, it's over, Tracy. Shh, shh. - I was so scared. - [Brandon] Shh, shh. (clown laughing) - Brandon, what the hell? - Give me the gun, Tracy. - No. - It's over, come on. - No, stay away from me. No, what the hell is going on here, Brandon? - [Denise] What the hell. You said this was your family's place. - Brandon, it's your house. - Who do you think did it, Tracy? Brandon, Brandon did. - Oh, you stay the fuck away from me. - I'd listened to her, uncle Billy. She's got a gun. Come on now, give me the gun. - What the hell is going on here? - Well, it's a game. After the pagan orgy, (Tracy yelping) orgy, I feed everybody to a monster in the woods. It's a game we've been playing for quite a while. Well, actually they've been playing. I just start it. - Who's they? - [Tracy] My mom, my dad, and now me. (Tracy yelping) Thirsty? Me too. (nursery music) - Denise? - What's up, Trace? - Oh my God. - Brandon, how could you have killed all of those people? - What people? Are you talking about Mark? He was a pussy. - (yelling) Susan. - Maybe the boogeyman got her? Woo. - This is what's wrong. (Billy laughing) - Come on, come on. Oh, oh, come on. - Fuck you, Brandon. - Give me the gun, give me the gun. - Fuck you, Brandon. (gun shooting) (Tracy crying) - Fuck yeah, I told you she'd pull the trigger. Oh, yes. - You think we'd give you a gun with bullets in it, bitch? Swear to God, babe, I hated that you fucked her. - [Brandon] Mmm, are you jealous? - Not anymore. (Tracy screaming) - [Tracy] Oh no. (Tracy screaming) Oh no. No, oh my God. No, put me down. (clapping) - See you later for dinner. (sighing of relief) (upbeat, cheery music) M? David.
