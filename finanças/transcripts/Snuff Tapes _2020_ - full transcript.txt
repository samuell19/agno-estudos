For this story all you need to know is that I am a journalist. A research journalist. In my work I've been able to take advantage of opportunities to investigate issues that many people would find shocking. Several years ago I started investigating a series of sexual assaults against women. I discovered more than I would like to remember. Cases about trafficking women, child prostitution, rape and murder. Many of them recorded on videos, sold through the black market, depicting the most terrible crimes, snuff tapes. SNUFF MOVIES ARE RECORDINGS OF REAL MURDERS WITH THE PURPOSE OF DISTRIBUTION FOR COMMERCIAL ENTERTAINMENT. TO DATE IT HAS NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE TO PROVE IF THESE RECORDINGS REALLY EXIST. I am about to conclude the most important investigation of my life. The man I am following is a violent man, very violent. PSYCHOPATH PROFILE Without empathy. Disciplined in his work. With a compulsive obsession that leads him to kidnap, torture, rape and even murder women. The one thing I know for sure, is that he portrays his victims in recordings from different times. It wouldn't attract much attention if he didn't record his victims with a video camera, while subjecting them to the most abhorrent abuse. Just imagine. Unfortunately, thanks to three cases that occurred in my home town. I've been able to put together clues that have allowed me to get closer to him. The first case I want to present is that of Jesus Moyano. A teenager, only seventeen years old. I realised that somebody grabbed me from behind and covered my mouth with a cloth. It had a pleasant smell. Something sweet. The last thing I remember is that the sky was orange. Very orange. I wasn't fully conscious. I felt nauseous and dizzy. I also felt tired. Headache. I wasn't able to lift a finger. Quiet, silence. Go back to sleep. Soon I will kick your fucking face in. That's it. Quiet. Nothing will happen to you. Quiet That's it. Quiet. Yes. You're beautiful. Quiet. I love cold bodies like that. I love them. Look at me. What the hell did you do? There is not much information about Jesus. I found some old statements during my investigation. After she was interrogated for several days she disappeared and the case was closed. The case of Marcela Alcaine is the one I have researched the most. I performed a thorough cross examination and she told me in detail what happened to her. Hi, Pablo? Hi Marcelo, how are you? How was your trip? Did you bring some extra clothes for the session? Tell me more about your job and everything. Her dreams of being a model were destroyed the day she met this guy. We'll take the photos later. Wait for me. Yes. I'll be there soon. Just preparing the camera. But I can hear you. Your house is big. Yes. Do you like the house? Yes. Thank you. Sorry, I didn't offer you anything. Water, soda, tea? A tea will be fine. Tea is is then. I brought some clothes... for the photo shoot. Okay, great. I also have some clothes for the session. That's fine. But don't worry. Pablo? Yes? Can I use your phone? I forgot to call my mum and she's probably getting worried. Yes of course. It's next to you. You can use it. Okay. I woke with a bright light that dazzled me for a while. I felt cold. I was in an old ugly room. Wet. With a smell like naphthalene. Rancid. I remember it made me feel sick. Sometimes I felt liquid on my face. I touched it... and it was blood. I woke up terrified. Paralysed with fear. Totally paralysed. I was taking big breaths... but the air was not getting to my lungs. I felt suffocated. Right. A voice ordered me to stand. Get up! With insults and swearing. I tried my best. Why? Don't shout during the game. Do you hear me? Okay. Then the same voice ordered me to take my dress off. Take off your clothes or I will kill you. Did you hear me? Right. My hands were shaking so much it was hard for me to do it. I begged him to leave me alone. Please. I begged him not to hurt me. Undress for me. Right. I realised I was being recorded on camera... but I was scared, so I obeyed him. I did it out of fear. Undress or I will kill you. Because he told me he was going to kill me if I screamed. Don't shout. Don't cry. These are the rules. Right, come on. Stop crying. Stop crying. Yes. Yes, take off your panties, bitch. Yes. Right, the rules are no crying and no shouting. "You didn't want to be a model?" He asked me. "Tonight is your lucky night." Hey. Shhh. Quiet. No shouting. No crying. Look at me. Yes, here. Look at me. Come here. Come or I'll drag you here. Yes, here. Look at me. Don't shout. If you shout, I'm going to kill you. No. Good, drag yourself. Drag yourself, drag yourself. That's it. Come on, drag yourself. Come here, look at me. Good. Come here. Go on, go on. Come here. Get on all fours. Don't shout. Why? If you shout, I'll kill you. Understand? Look at me. Come here. That's right. Look at me. That's right. Now put yourself on all fours. Put yourself on all fours. Very good. Quiet. Look at me now. Look at me. Yes, here. Look at me. Look here at the camera. Look at the camera. That's right. Come closer. Very Good. That's right. Oh Yes. Very good. Silence. If you shout, I'll kill you, okay? Put yourself on all fours. Like a table, okay? Like a table. That's it. That's it. Okay. Very good. Okay. Very good. That's right. Straight. Don't move! It's all right, it's all right. Very good. No, no. No! Feel this! Idiot, stupid, piece of shit! You ruined the game, bitch! After a while he didn't want to collaborate any more denying everything that happened. Marcelo had been a victim of this psychopath... and also of the people who watched her ordeal. I believe there were threats that stopped her continuing with the case. She stopped answering my calls and it was difficult for me to find her. She also disappeared. Yes, one of my stories. The male character. Do you remember him? Yes I do. Of course. It was selected in the language contest. So I'm really happy. I can't believe it. Mm-hmm. Oh, and... Mmm... I would like to ask you something. When are we going to see each other? When are we going to meet? We've been talking about it for months. It's been a long time. A long time talking. That's a lot. Today? I wasn't expecting that. Could we do tomorrow? That would be better for me. Oh no, if you can't come tomorrow, that's okay. Today is good. At 9:30? Yes. 9:30 in Vittorio's bar. Outside the bar. Agreed? Yes. Yes Emilio, that's good. I hope you'll surprise me it's our first date. Bye. See you Emilio. Bye. It's been ten days since Marcela Alceno went missing. According to the girls mother she came here to study. The police have not found any information of her whereabouts. Catalina? Yes, that's me. Nice to see you. I mean meet you. Shall we go? Where? Around town. By car? Yes of course. Okay. Lets go. Catalina, you make me nervous. Thank you You're welcome. There's some vodka in the glove compartment. Try it. It's good. Great. Thank you. I love vodka. Excuse me. Great. I'm feeling bad, Emilio. What did you give me? I'm hot. I'm so hot. Quiet. Silence. Quiet. Do you want to send a message? Here is your camera. Smile to the whole continent. I just hope that someday someone will watch this video and take revenge. Again I'm going home. I am Catalina Ibarra and this is my story of revenge. Mama. It's me. Mama? Mama? Hi Catalina, your office told me that were traveling. I've gone to the beach. Call me later. Bye, kisses. How are you Mr Gerardo? Fine Catalina, it's nice to see you. Did you tell "madam" that you want to marry me? It's a tradition, didn't you notice that all the women are married around here? But I'm not interested in marriage. I wanted to greet you in person Mr Gerardo. Great, because everybody misbehaves around here. Can I help you? No, it's light. Just to the elevator. Okay, thanks. How's the big city? Santiago? Oh... it's collapsing, polluted too busy, no stars in the sky but it's fine because I have job. That's how it is. But I hope you stay because we miss you. You know I'll move back as soon as I can. Good. Thanks. In you go. Thank you. Have a nice day. Okay, thank you. FORMAT PAL For years I've seen countless videos of dubious origin in order to find material that might help me with my plan for revenge. I found a lot of material. Family videos, weddings, football, movies. Nothing out of the ordinary. A lot of pornography. But nothing extreme or transgressive. But a couple of years ago I bought some VHS tapes in PAL format. Phase Alternative Line, PAL, is a colour encoding system used in television broadcast systems around the World. But not in the American continent with the exception of Brazil and Argentina which are the only countries that use this format in South America. This format is widely used in Europe, Oceania and Asia. And on this format you can find videos involving trafficked women and illegal pornography. This footage is exactly what I have been looking for and now it's in my hands revealing new evidence every time I watch it. This one please. What will it be? Will it be PAL? Damn! These videos only work on a PAL player. And there was only one person who could help me keep moving forward. My best friend also a Journalist. Esteban. Hello, is Esteban there? It's Catalina. Thank you very much. Hey, Esteban. Cata, how are you? Fine, and you? Good. Good to see you. It's been a while. How long? Two, three weeks? At least. Did you bring the VHS player? Yes I got a PAL player from work. And I also brought a TV that works with the player so you can watch the video tape. But I've got a TV. It won't work with the player. It's a big old TV, so I'll have to come with you and carry it to your home. Okay, lets go. But let me have a drink first. I just ordered one. Okay. Come in. Over here. Where do you want it? Here in the corner. It's heavy. Yes, it's so big. Yeah. I found it at work. It's good that they let you borrow it. Yeah. They also had a VHS player. It's heavy too. Yeah, heavy and hard to find because it's... PAL There's not many left. With this you can play the tape. I hope it works. Cata, pass me the cables. They're connected to the other TV. I'll connect them later. Don't worry, thanks. Are you sure? Sure, I can do it. I'm clever. Clever? Yes. Really?. I've always been clever. You want a Coffee. Coffee. Americano? Let's go. Lets go. Lets go for a coffee. I'm going. After the drinks. They were good but the music was awful. Sugar? No, I don't have sugar, only sweetener. Okay, sweetener. It's okay? Look, there's a spoon next to you. Where? Ah, there. Ah! I'm getting anxious. Are you sure you want to watch the video alone? Are you ready for that? Yes, I'm sure. Don't worry because... Take it. Great, thank you. Actually, I feel like... I have to watch it by myself. Can I have the spoon? Sure. I recycle. FOUND I remember afterwards I recorded a message that I will never forget. Hours later I was thrown into a landfill on the outskirts of town. For a long time I wondered why he had left me alive. Not like the girl I saw in the video. Over the years, several victims were found. All of them alive. Cata, are you sure it was you? Yes, of course. I'm sure, Esteban. Do you want to watch it? Do you want me to? Yes, I would like you to see it. Good. I will watch it. Maybe you'll see things that I didn't. I don't know. Don't worry, I'll watch it. Cata, you should go to bed. I can't, I have problems sleeping. I have a headache. Okay, but take it easy. You're too stressed. I don't know. You should take a sleeping pill. I promise I will call you in the morning after work. Please do. I will, but now you should rest. The video is there... If you... want to watch it. I don't think I'll sleep but I prefer to go to my bedroom. I'll watch it don't worry. Sleep well. INVESTIGATION Yesterday was an important day for my research. I saw... Videos. Lots of videos. In which... many women were tortured. Raped. One of them... was me. My worst nightmare. But it's what I've been looking for. Not only to find the man responsible, but also to find what was recorded on that camera. That camera returns to my mind over and over again. Although there were more women in the video I couldn't continue watching it. I had seen enough. Esteban watched the rest of the material. And we will see... what we can do. Horrible. Thanks for coming Esteban. It was hard getting out of work. That's why I'm grateful. Did you see the note I left you? Yes. I got news for you. I watched the videos and I took some pictures. Did you bring them? No, I have to develop them but I'll be back later. Okay, great. Then we can look at them. I did notice his tattoos which look like they're fake. His modus operandi is always changing. He's always doing something different. Did you notice? Is he hiding himself? Yes, exactly. Bastard. Did you see his face? Are you sure you can recognise him? Yes. Thinking about how unpredictable he is. I couldn't see him because of the mask but I... I will recognise him. Since I decided to tell Esteban what happened he has helped with my investigation as much as I allow him to. He is a good partner But I never planned to involve him. When we investigate, we work as a team discovering things together. This situation makes you question m any things and at the end of the day it's only me who can end this. And you could fix it? Yes. Thank you. Here it is. It should work now. That's great. I thought it was ruined. Well, yes. Good. We should be able to find more evidence. I couldn't watch it because I don't have the PAL player. You watch it here? I have to go back to work. I told them I was going to the bank. Okay, don't worry and thanks, I'm really grateful. Come back after work. Although I think I'll start watching it now because I'm more relaxed. The worst is over. I'll come back later with the photos and I'll watch it then. Okay. Marcela? Answer the phone please. Hello? Marcela? Hi, I'm Catalina. Marcela, listen to me, please. We have to meet. I need to see you. I can pick you up or you can come to my house. REUNION Marcela was never... never dead. I didn't know that she was... the woman on the tv. The woman wrapped in plastic. All the time I thought that she was dead. All these years I had that in my head. But today... I realize... it was her and she was alive. She was hurt... but she was alive. It has been very difficult... But also very rewarding. Now lets see how everything goes. No, don't worry. I don't want you to get into any trouble at work. No problem. It's okay. If she is.... watching this video. Yes. No no... No I have not talked to her. We haven't spoken. I'm telling you the truth. I think so. Oh yeah... I need to ask you another favour. I need to know, how do I say? I need to know that. Please, please. Now I know that you're not convinced but I'm really sure. I am! Hello? Bye, kisses. Come in Marcela. This is my place. Where I do my research. Take your time. It's okay. I've been doing this for years so, I'm not afraid. But it's hard. Yes, that's you. When you had to lie down. Look. With all the new information I've got including the videos. I spent a lot of time... Working things out. I know this guy is from Talco, or near by... He probably lived there for years. There are more suspects. Who's that? For many years I had doubts. A lot of doubts. Now... I know it's him. Are you sure? Yes I'm sure, I've been getting information for a while and a have this feeling inside. I know it's him but what if I'm wrong? I will contact him. We are... very close. I don't know what he does because he's always changing his appearance. His background, work, places. I don't know. I can't remember. Of course not. Many years have passed and people forget. They get those bad thoughts out of their head. But not me. These guys change their appearance all the time. How much time did you spend with him before anything happened? A few minutes. Not much time. And then the mask. If you want, I can get you a coffee and you can stay here. I've got some girls to find. And this bastard, too. I don't know how... but I will find him. Hello, Jesus. I had less information with the case of Jesus Montayo. When I met her again I decided to tell her about my research and what I had planned. She decided to tell me her story. A story of pain and loneliness. A pain that continues to require treatment with drugs which further isolate her from society. AMBUSH Hello Cata, hello, how are you? I'm good, I'm good. Listen, they want me to work in Santiago so I'll be away for three days. The great moment was about to arrive. And with Marcela and Jesus on board there was no turning back. I told them that Esteban had given me all the information necessary. We had the place, time, and everything we needed for our plan. The only doubt I had was how the girls would take it when I revealed my true intentions. I went to your apartment to leave a note. It's with Mr Gerardo. Yes, he gave it to me. It's got all the information I found. Pictures and some documents including a fake ID. His background says he was in a psychiatric hospital. And yes, he's a very dangerous man, okay. We have to be very careful with him. According to this information he has a psychopathic personality disorder. This means that he doesn't feel empathy He can be very charming and manipulative Okay. Yeah. He will use whoever he can to achieve his goals. And there's no treatment for this condition. This guy is not going to change. Even if they try to treat him. In the documents I sent you the subject of his mother goes deeper. She abused him for years during his childhood. At the age of ten, he killed her. Some files refer to that case in particular and the relationship he has with death. Maybe that's the reason he doesn't kill his victims. Cata, Cata, wait for me. This guy is dangerous. You have to wait for me. Don't worry, I'm not going to do anything. Yes, yes, we are getting close. That motherfucker is going down, I know it. Okay, kisses. Bye. Bye. I don't know what else to tell you beyond everything that happened. The same that happened to you. We're all going to catch this bastard. You understand me? Please. Marcela? Lets do it. Lets do it. Why don't you call your friend and ask him if this is the right place? He's coming, don't worry. I've got to go. What? Jesus, please. You don't want to see the face of the guy that fucked up your life? We're lucky. We should be grateful because there are a lot of women trying to deal with this on their own. We were lucky to find each other. Lets fuck him up. I hope Jesus doesn't quit. I don't know. She's a bit insecure. She's very insecure. You're not sure? I didn't say that, it was Marcela. Marcela, don't worry, it's going to be safe. Lots of work. We've got to get her ready for this. Marcela. Please don't get drunk. I'm anxious. Me too, we are all anxious. Very anxious. We've been waiting 40 minutes but 40 minutes is nothing. There he is. Here we go. What do we do? What do we do? Cata, what do we do? Everything remains as planned, okay. I'm going to the bathroom. Did you hear me? Yes, yes, yes. I'm going to the bathroom. Then I'm going to sit down at his table, okay? Yes. When you see me putting the drugs in his drink. You follow me. Okay. Are we ready? What's your name? My name is Mariano. What's your name? Veronica. Nice name, Veronica. When I was child I didn't like it, but I do now. Where are you from, Veronica? Santiago. Which part? I live in the center. I came here to visit a friend. A friend? Nice. Where is your friend? She has a daughter, so I came out alone. You're on your own, I guess? Yes, tonight I am. Right, tonight. That's what I meant. Uh hu. And what do you do Veronica? I'm an anthropologist. Anthropologist. And you? I'm a project manager. I'm also an investor. That's what I do.

It's nice. Yes. And I like this bar. I come every Friday. So you've lived here for a while? Yes, a couple of years. Sometimes it gets a bit monotonous. Work. Women. You know. And you? Me? Why did you sit here? Because you looked at me. Did I? Yeah. You're beautiful, Veronica. Thank you. Likewise. Thank you. Cheers to that. Cheers. Can you wait for me? I'll be back in a second. Sure. but don't leave me on my own. I wasn't too long was I? So you said that... you don't know this area. Would you like me to show you around? We can go somewhere else. Yes? Would you? Sure. So lets go. We could get another drink. Maybe go to my place. Yeah. Seems like a good idea. I don't feel very well. Mariano? I don't know. It's weird. I can't breathe properly. Maybe you've drunk too much? I don't know. Maybe. Maybe I'm just tired. We should go. You feel that bad? Yeah. We'll go outside. For some air. Yeah, sure. I need some fresh air. Okay. I'll help you. Girls, can you help me? Be careful. Are you okay? No. How do you feel? Take it easy now. Cata. Cata! Cata. Cata! Don't go. Don't! I need to be alone with this bastard for one hour.

It was disgusting. Not just me, but all those girls you abused. You piece of trash. You have no idea. You don't know how it feels to live with this. To be alone. Since that night... Alone. Not knowing if this nightmare is... real or a dream. So we ruined you're game. We ruined your game, you pervert. You bastard. You fucked up. You pervert. The game is over. You're going to die.

But I do have the ovaries and I am ovulating. Why do say that? You don't have the balls or the dick. Do you remember this sound? Pervert, do you remember this sound? What did you do? Scream now you bastard. Scream now! That's what I wanted to hear. We should have done this years ago. Look at this pervert who destroyed our lives.
