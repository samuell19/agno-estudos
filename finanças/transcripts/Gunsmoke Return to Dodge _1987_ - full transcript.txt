Doc's office? Dodge City, Kansas. You came all the way up here from New Orleans? Old habits die hard. How long have I been in here? Almost three weeks. Three weeks? Somebody really put a knife in you. He was a gunslinger named Logan. He broke out of prison, came looking for me. And you felt it was your duty to society to bring him in. It was either that or kill him, Kitty. Glad you came here. Looking great. You cut that out. What? You listen to me, cowboy. l've got you out from underneath my fingernails and you're going to stay out, do you hear me? Yes, ma'am. Your fever broke the night before last, so I don't think you need anybody baby-sitting you anymore. I'm going to go get some sleep. Kitty, I understand the rules and all, but it doesn't mean that we can't still be friends, does it? Friends? Friends? I'm staying at the Long Branch while I'm in town, so when and if you feel up to it, I might even buy you a beer. ( Voices calling ) Hey, hey, hey. Oh! Now, there's a greeting a father can appreciate. Let me look at you. Let me look at you. Lands sakes, girl. You have growed. How come there ain't a whole passel of bucks around here chasing you? Braves are hunting. There's a buffalo herd near the foot of the mountain. But you are free. You have come to stay with us? I wished I could, honey. Oh, how I wished I could. But right now, it ain't in the cards. Got to talk to your mama. Damn me, I've missed you something terrible. Are you someone that I know? Don't you get smart with me, woman. We've got to talk. We'll talk later. Much later. You always was one to get right to the point. Kitty, don't say it. l'm not going to, because it wouldn't do any good. Look, seems to me, I remember a lady telling me she'd buy me a beer when I felt better. If you don't tell the doctor, then you're on, cowboy. Let's go. It's the marshal! ( Cheering and applause ) Hold on a minute. Don't forget, I'm not the marshal here anymore. You've got the best man in the territory right here, my friend, Newly O'Brian. ( Cheers ) Now, I'd like to buy everybody a drink, but some fellas up-river relieved me of my goods, so... No way you can buy a drink in this bar, Matt Dillon. All right, everybody, drinks are on the house. ( Cheering ) Attention! Sorry to intrude on the celebration, but I'm in a hurry. Can somebody here tell me where I can find the marshal in this town? I'm the marshal. What can I do for you? Lieutenant Brian Dexter, Marshal. I'm suppose to meet my command here. 12 men equipped for hard duty and ready to ride. MARSHAL: Well, sir, your command is not coming. I got a wire from the fort. Your men were ordered back to the base. Ordered back? Yes, sir. There's some trouble with the Blackfoot, but it says you're at liberty to go on alone. Indian trouble. Well, that's unfortunate. Then again, I never did feel that an entire detachment of cavalry was necessary to hunt down one man. Lieutenant... Marshal, I've been sent here to capture an escaped convict by the name of Jake Flagg, who not only escaped from Black Fork Prison, he shot to death the prison warden in the process. What's this about Jake Flagg? And who are you? My name's Dillon, Matt Dillon. Dillon, I know you. You were a lawman or something like that, weren't you? What do know about Jake Flagg? You know Flagg? You want to answer my question, boy? Uh... ( clearing throat ) It came down through Army channels, sir. Warden Amos Brown was a retired Army officer an-and I've been sent to bring in the man who killed him, and, Marshal, I've been told that if Flagg wasn't found here, he could be found in the Colorado high country. Jake Flagg knows the Colorado mountains better than any man around. Let me tell you something, Lieutenant. You try to follow him up there, you're not going to find him, and you might not get back alive yourself. Well, I do have a map of the territory, Mr. Dillon, and I also have information that Flagg once owned a cabin up on Greenhorn Creek. I intend to find him. Good day, gentlemen. Dedicated, ain't he? He may be dedicated, but you could put his brains in a teacup. He's got to be stopped. Morning, ma'am. You'd be looking for the Judge. Yes, ma'am. They told me I could find him here. Not today. Probably not all week, if the mayflies are hatching. Mayflies? The trout eat 'em. The Judge is a fisherman. Ah, he'll be on the river, then. Yeah. But not around here. He's got his own special fishing hole. He thinks it's a secret, 'cause it's more than a day's ride upstream, but most everyone around here knows where it is, anyway. Is it important you find him? Matter of life and death. ( Indistinct voices ) As soon as I get to Canada, I'll send for you. I've got to find Matt first. That may take some time, if he's not at his cabin. We want to go with you. We don't want to lose you. Honey, there ain't nothing I'd like better than to take you two with me, but I can trail faster if I'm alone. I don't have to worry none about your safety. Lord, woman, just looking at you has put fire in my blood. You must go if men are coming. You must not be here. ( Sighs ) I'll send for you both. As God is my witness, I'll send for you. Louis says it, uh... shoots a shade high and to the right. I'll remember. He's having a horse saddled for you, and the rifle's in the saddle boot. Thanks, Kitty. How do you know you can even find him? I don't, but Jake's no murderer, and he's being hunted like one. If there's a chance I can find him, I gotta try. Guess you do. Take care, Matt, will you? I will. You know, Kitty, it's really been good seeing you again. Maybe when all this is over and I, uh, I get back... I'll be here. ( Door closes ) Aren't I always? Now, which one of you is Jake Flagg's woman? Now, speak up. I know she's here, because Brother Farnum and me have rendezvoused with Flagg. We's old friends, you might say. Little Doe's her name. Many a-time... Go to the cave quickly. All of you, go, go. If she don't speak up, one of you better. Or I'll kill this old heathen, here. And then I'll shoot a couple more. I'll go to them. No. I'll be all right. You go get our young men. Bring them back. Go! ...ain't got all day! My trigger finger is beginning to get itchy! I might even have to shoot six or seven... or all of you. I'm Jake Flagg's woman. He been here? Yes. Where'd he go? Now you lie, we'll be coming back. No need to lie. He's in the mountains. Why are you so eager to talk? Because Jake Flagg has great medicine. You try to harm him, he'll kill you, all of you. Not if you're with us, he won't. Why you try to find him? Because there's a $1000 reward on his head. That's much money? Woman, that there's a fortune. ( Screaming ) Come here! ( Grunting ) ( Screaming ) I warned you. You ride with us, you ride by our rules. I wasn't hurting that squaw none. Get out of here. And take your scum-sucking friends with you. Move! Get yourself a horse, woman! We're pulling out. Come on. ( Owl hooting ) ( Sighs ) ( Gun cocks ) DILLON: Get your hand away from it. Now, I could have been a bushwhacker or a grizzly. Either way, you could have been dead. Like I told you once before, you don't belong out here. Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Mr. Dillon? I'll tell you what I'm going to do, Lieutenant. I'm going to take your horse about two miles up the trail and turn him loose in the meadow up there. Toting that saddle, it'll probably take you most of the day to find him. You're going to regret this, Dillon. Let me give you a piece of advice. When you find that horse, get on him, and get back where you came from. I don't want your blood on my conscience. Damn you, Dillon! I'm going to find your friend, Jake Flagg. And then I'm going to find you and lock you up in the highest security prison west of the Mississippi! Ow! ( Groans ) Damn! ( Fishing reel whirring ) Evening... Your Honor. Mannon, what are you doing here? I done my time, Judge. Paid my debt to society like they say. Now I'm on a mission. Mission? Paying back them that sent me up to that hellhole they call Black Fork. Now, you leave here, Mannon. You leave here now, or you'll go back there to hang. You're really my first stop, Judge. You remember the trial, don't you? You kept calling me "a product of the devil's loins." ( Body thuds to ground ) ( Bird cawing ) A product of the devil's loins. It's catchy. HANNAH: Memories? ( Sighs ) An awful lot of men have come through those doors. One in particular, I'm guessing. One in particular. Well, lawman lives from day to day. I can understand why a woman wouldn't want to marry one. But when Matt took off the badge, he went one way, and you went the other. Why? There was a reason. Boss, they're robbing the freight office.

I'm trying to make some sense out of this. Where's the rest of your people? BRIGHT WATER: The braves are hunting and the others are gone away 'cause they're afraid. You mean Jake was here? Yes. He's gone to your cabin to find you. Uncle Matt, he broke out of prison 'cause he feared for your life. I'll find him, girl. Hold it right where you are, Mr. Dillon. You, sir, are under arrest for interfering with an officer of the United States government in the performance of his duties and while you are in custody, sir, you will assist me in the capture of the escaped felon, Jake Flagg.

He was looking for my father, too? That's right. Bright Water, would you look after him? The boy's as green as they come, but he does have backbone. One of these days, he'll make a hell of an officer. A blue belly? A blue belly who near got himself killed looking out for you. But he wants to take my father back to prison. That's right, Bright Water. So you'll be doing your father and me a big favor if you can keep him right here.

Maybe there is. If you can buy me enough time, l can get the lieutenant and the women down out of here. It's going to be slow moving with a wounded man. You got to hold them off as long as you can, Jake. Then you head for Canada. Hell, you're damn near there. I'll bring 'em to you. Lieutenant, do you think you can ride? I can ride. Come on. I'll help you up. Jake's going to buy us some time while we sneak down the back stairs. Then he's going to head for Canada. Come on. Come on, girl. Give me a kiss. l'll see you when the Lord permits. Now, go on, go on. All right, let's go. We ain't got much time. Go on. Go on. There'll be another time. Yeah. Go on. Go on. I'd like you to know, Mr. Flagg, that you're officially released from custody. Obliged, Lieutenant. Good luck to you. Just keep coming, boys. Somebody's gonna get hurt. ( Gunshot ) Farnum! Let's go. Damn it, they're flanking me. We got him! He's ours! ( Cackles ) Whoo! Whoo-hoo! ( Grunts ) ( Distant gunfire ) Over this ridge is the wagon road. It leads to the fort. Is there a doctor there? A good one. You're going back. Been a real experience knowing you, son. Me, too, sir. ( Gunfire continues ) Took your blasted time. Well, I figured you'd have them all under by now, Jake. Who the hell was that? Ain't you got eyes? It's that big fella we tried bushwhacking at the river. I told you those old bulls have a way of coming back on you. DIGGER: Jake! You up there, Jake? I know that voice. Digger? Is that you, Digger? It's me, Jake. Winged you pretty good, I guess, huh? Aw, it ain't nothing, Digger! You got that crazy brother of yours with you? I'm here, Jake. We get that reward, I'll drink to your health. Who you got up there with you? Matt Dillon. Dillon? You mean, Marshal Dillon? The same! Jake, is that Digger McCloud? In the flesh. That raunchy old coot. I didn't even know he was still alive. Isn't he the one they used to call Little Big Man? Ran naked through a Blackfoot gauntlet, fought a duel with Yellowknife? That's the one. I partnered with him on a trapline once, same as I done with you. Damn, Jake. You know, I got an idea. Maybe we can get out of this with some style. You still there, Digger? I'm here. Is that you, Dillon? Yeah. You know, Digger, I heard a lot about you in the camps back in the old rendezvous days. Had more guts than brains, they used to say. What are you gettin' at, Dillon? I guess just that I never thought I'd see Digger McCloud hiding in the grass. Well, I ain't exactly proud of myself, Dillon, but the way it is, me and Farnum, we need the money. Jake's going to be our ticket to the promised land. Sure is a pity. lf I got to go out, I would sure like to go out face-to-face with a man that's got your reputation. Keep it going, Matt. I think you got him going. You know, there's four of you, Digger, and only two of us. Poor old Jake, here, he's all shot up. What do you say? What do you say, Farnum? What the hell, Digger? We ain't exactly been living high off the hog these last few years and shining times is long gone. Let's give it a go. Are you two crazy? You're really going to step out and fight? We're thinking on it. Well, you can think all you want. I'm getting the hell out of here, 'cause you're plum crazy. Dang if you ain't done it, Matt! One of them tagalongs is running like a rabbit. What about you, Potts? Ain't you going, too? Well, I don't know. Supposing we was to win? I'd be one of the biggest men in the territory. Took on Jake Flagg and Matt Dillon, face-to-face? Nose-to-nose? Mano a mano? Danged if I won't give her a whirl. JAKE: Well, I guess it's all over now, eh, boys? Can't see you fighting like men, now that you lost your edge. Damn him. ( Roars ) Fill your hand, you old bastard. Here we come. It's been a pleasure, Matt. Likewise, Jake. Damn it, let's do 'er. POTTS: They're getting awful close. No! Farnum? Afraid not, Digger. Shining times, Dillon. Weren't they? ( Chuckles ) ( Chokes ) I calculate my time is short. Hope you can stay on to put me under. I'll be here, Jake. You came high again, Matt. After 20 years of keeping the lid on Dodge, you came... back to God's country. Last stand for the likes of you and me. Mann... There's still Mannon. When you find him... put one in him for me, will you? I mean to. I don't suppose you know any... fancy words. You always was one to get the jump on things, Jake. We're going to share it all again. Crossing the high creek, so cold it'd split a tree trunk. Remember wintering with the Indians? The huntin' and the fishin', Jake? The taste of beaver tail... buffalo hump... And the quiet. Whoever you are, come out slow, with your hands in the air. It's Mannon. He's in Dodge. He's got Miss Kitty. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Damn. He said... you was to come to him. You can't. I have to. He's a madman. He beat you up twice. He could kill you. ( Clicks ) You sent for me. Sent for you? Why no, Miss Kitty. It was just an invitation so we could talk alone. You warned everybody what would happen if you were bushwhacked. There always has to be a Judas. You were mine once, but I forgive you, Red. Why don't you get out, Mannon? Get out? Matt beat you once and he'll beat you again. He never beat me. I had the time in Black Fork to figure that much out. He'd have been dead but for what you did. What did I do? Tell me, Mannon. Don't play games with me, Red. You know. I could have walked over him like a man walks over short grass. A man's got to pay attention to his direction. Got to pay close attention. You made sure I was distracted, Red. You distracted me. With purpose. You still lost. No, I didn't lose. I downed Matt Dillon, for sure, but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about what you said. What you said! I've forgotten. You forgot? You forgot that? Forgot that I was on my knees to you bearing flowers? Matt Dillon's a man. But he's dead. Uh-uh. You are. Red? It's been lots of years and I've never lost. You did with me. Apologize. For what, Mannon? You seem to remember everything so well. Tell me what I said. You know, Red. ( Horse whinnying ) He's here. He's a better man than you are. He'll beat you. Not this time, Red. Where is she, Hannah? With him. We tried to reason with her, Matt, but she wouldn't listen. She seemed to think there was some way to stop him. Where are they now? Dodge House. Upstairs. Front room. I'm going with you, Mr. Dillon. Thank you, Oakum. Not this time. Spoil my fun? Buckle me. Do it. ( Dog barking ) ♪ ♪ Go ahead. It's been 12 years, Dillon. Same town. Same street. Nothing changed. I'm still the best. You're nothing, Mannon. All you're good for is beating up on women. Now draw. ( Gunshot ) ( Gasps ) ( Sighs ) ♪ ♪
