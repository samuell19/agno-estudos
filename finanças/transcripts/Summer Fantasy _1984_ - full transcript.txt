[ambient music playing] MAN (ON RADIO): It's KDSK. KDSK coming your way. And you're cruising with the bruiser here. And he's pumping 50,000 watts your way. The sun is up. So let's rise and shine, kiddies. Spring vacation is here. [music playing] Been too long in the classroom. I'm ready to go. Tired of listening to teachers. I'm ready for rock and roll. The weather's fine now. I want to be outside now. Forget about the time now. Just let the days go by. Summer's almost here. I want to get out on my own. Summer's almost here. Just want to get away from home. Forget about everything. And go for something new. Gonna take a vacation. And that's what I want to do. Summer's almost here. Everyone's restless and looking for fun. And everyone's hoping they're going to find a summer love. They want to find someone now. Someone to share the fun now. Romancing in the sun now. The fun has just begun. Summer's almost here. I want to get out on my own. Summer's almost here. Wow. Did you see that? What? Buzzy O'Connell. He just did a full turn. Joanna, I think I'm in love. You're unbelievable. That's the third one today. We've only been here an hour. Well, I can't help it. I'm 17. I'm at the height of my sexual powers. He's at least 30 and probably married. What's his name? Carlisle. He's too old. Too old for what? For what you're thinking. [laughs] You're never too old for what I'm thinking. [laughter] What's the joke? None of your business. Hmm. Who's your friend? [sighs] Joanna, meet Tod. He thinks he's Richard Gere, which comes from pumping too much iron and frying his brains out. So why haven't I seen you before? Well, I just moved here about a month ago. Oh. You, uh, like it here? Yeah. I really haven't seen that much-- I mean, the beach, school. Come out with me tonight. I'll show you around. I'm sorry. I can't. [nervous chuckle] Got a date? Yep. My dad. Y-- your folks divorced? Five years. Mine two. Oh. Bummer. How about tomorrow night? Well, I don't think so. Well, I'll, uh, see you around. OK. When you see Denise, tell her that I'll be at the gym tonight. OK. Ooh. Tod the Terrible. [chuckling] Did he put the make on you? He tried. But, uh, I think I acted like a 10-year-old. Oh, I bet he liked that one. I don't know. You know, Joanna, it really wouldn't hurt to go out with him. I mean, if you're going to live here, you gotta learn how to deal with these kind of guys. I guess. Unless, of course, you're only interested in senior citizens. [laughs] [wave crashing] Hey, somebody help that guy out. He's in trouble. [chatter] What's going on? Buzzy. He was hit by his board. Oh, my gosh. Thought you might need this. Yeah, it's a bad cut. Have you got a bandage? Good. Take it easy. You're going to be all right, sport. Where's my board? Easy, easy. Let one of your fans get it. Buzzy, I want you to take it easy for a couple of days. All right? OK. Thanks, Carlisle, Smitty. JOANNA: Hi. Sorry I'm late. Hi, Mom. Hi, honey. Guess what? What? I just saw Dr. Harding in the hallway. Oh, no. Did he growl or just sneer? [chuckles] I don't think he likes me. He doesn't approve of women, or Easterners, or nepotism. [laughs] When do we become Californians? Just as soon as we start to complain if the weather drops below 60 degrees in January. JOANNA: [laughs] Are you going to get in trouble hiring me? Don't be silly. Well, I mean, maybe I shouldn't be doing this. Of course you should. You're just my assistant. It's good experience for you. That way, when you get to medical school, you'll know what you want to specialize in. And speaking of which, this came for you today. Wellington College. That's right. Open it up. Well, what if I didn't get in? With your grades? Well, you know, when I applied, we were living in Pennsylvania. Just open the envelope, Joanna. The suspense is killing me. OK. [chuckles] [opening envelope] I got in. Oh, congratulations, honey. I'm so proud of you. Joanna, what's the matter? Mom, when did you know you wanted to be a doctor? When someone gave me a nurse's kit for my fifth birthday, and I made my mother return it and get me a doctor's kit. Now, the defense committee has to play hardball-- link Sanchez and Rodriguez to Sacco and Vanzetti. They're foreigners, political activists, and were set up by racist elements in the district. What kind of money are we talking about? $50,000. Build a network of defense committees throughout the state-- posters, buttons, petitions. We've got to get the word out. And your fee? - Deferred. - Again? [chuckling] Come on. Oh, hi, honey. Hi. Oh, good to see you. Oh, boy. Everybody, this is my daughter Joanna. She just moved here from Harrisburg. Honey, this is my staff. Scruffy lot, aren't they? - [light chuckle] Glad to meet you, Joanna. Nice to meet you too. Come to the office sometime. And I'll be glad to show you around. Watch out for Phil. He's the office letch. [laughs] Well, so what do I owe the honor? Uh, we were supposed to have dinner tonight. Oh, no, I forgot. Don't worry, Joanna. He's done it to me a million times. I'm sorry, babe. But stick around. We'll be through in about an hour. Or two. JOANNA: It's OK, Dad. It's no problem. Well, I'm sorry, honey. It's a new case, an important one. I understand. We'll do it Saturday. I promise. I'll see you later. [soft music playing] BEN: All right. Now, the defense committee will take care of benefits-- rock concerts, dinners, any other fund-raising we can think of. [sizzling] Oh, honey. You scared me. [laughs] Well, that was a short dinner. What dinner? Sacco and Vanzetti showed up. You're kidding? Your father must be in heaven. He is. You know, Mom, I think he has a girlfriend. Well, why do you say that? Did you meet her? Yeah, she was at the house with a bunch of other people. Oh. Well, that's great. It's about time your daddy found someone to be involved with. You mean you don't care? Joanna, it's been five years since the divorce. Your father isn't a monk. What's she look like? Is she pretty? In a kind of obvious way. Thank you. [chuckles] Oh, by the way, Denise called. She said she's over at Reggio's if you want to go join her. Well, is it OK if I go? Well, sure. It's still Easter vacation, isn't it? Two more months until graduation. I can't wait. Then I can stay out as long as I want to. Oh, you can, can you? [chuckles] We'll just see about that, young lady. This really smells great. What is it? Irish stew. Get a bowl. - OK. [laughs] This one's for Sacco. Get one for Vanzetti. [laughs] [music playing] Oh. Hi. Wait a sec. Coffee please. [sighs] It says here that Sagitarians have uncontrollable sexual appetites. [laughs] What does it say about Taurians? I don't know. But I have enough for both of us. So we don't have to worry. [laughter] What's going on? I don't know. Yes, I do. I got accepted to Wellington. Hey, that's what you wanted, right? No, that's what my mom wanted-- a school nearby with a good premed program. I can't believe you're going to be a doctor-- going to medical school with all those gorgeous guys. Just remember me. OK? [laughs] But I don't want to go to medical school. You don't? No. I don't even want to work in a hospital. My mom got me that job because she thought I'd love it. I hate it. Tell her. I can't. Why not? It's your life, Joanna. You don't understand. Medicine means everything to my mom. She and my dad broke up because of it. Turn around slowly. Hi, Mr. Harrison. [snickers] Carrie doesn't waste any time, does she? Really. Oh. He is so gorgeous. And he's a little younger than, uh, what's his name. - Carlisle. - [laughs] He's also our teacher. Hey, look, after graduation, he'll be just another guy. And we'll be 18. You got it. [laughter] You want some cheesecake? - Yeah. It looks good. Mm. Carrie, come up here for a second. I want you to watch Joanna. She's got the perfect form. I think my form's a whole lot better. Not in the pool, it isn't. I think I need private lessons, Coach. Carrie, there are laws in the state that prevent me from taking you up on your most tempting offer. Back in the water. Joanna, your backstroke's looking great. Oh, thanks. I've been working on it. Well, it shows. What about me, Mr. [inaudible]?? Well, your form is good. But you have to work more on your speed. Really? I always thought I was fast enough. [laughs] - Come here, you two. Now, listen, I'm just telling a couple of my best swimmers about this. The county is looking for lifeguards for the summer. It pays $5.50 an hour, which is better than surf burners. So if you're interested, get down to the lifeguard headquarters on Marine Street, and tell them I sent you. - OK. Thanks. - OK. Thanks. You want to? What? Be a lifeguard. No, I've already got a summer job at the hospital. But I thought you hated it? But I'm doing it. OK? So drop the subject. OK. We'll go tot he lifeguard station. Then I'll drop you at the hospital. I told you I can't. [sighs] Joanna, think of all the hunks on the beach crowding around us, flirting, asking us out. [laughs] Denise, you're crazy. Come on. What do we have to lose? Look, all we have to do is fill out an application. We don't even have to try out if you don't want to. [sighs] I bet Carlisle's there. You think so? [laughs] Come on. [music playing] Hi. Can I help you? Yeah. Uh, we want to apply for the, uh, lifeguard job. Fill in your name and phone number. Thanks. And then take it into the next room. OK. Thank you. I'm putting down your number because I don't want anybody calling my house. OK. [phone ringing] If you're coming in, come in. Don't play around. Biaggi? Yeah. Brannigan. You two good swimmers? We're on the swim team at Lincoln. And our coach told us to apply. Your friend have a voice? Yeah. Well, let me tell you what you're letting yourselves in for. If you qualify for the training program, you'll learn first aid, CPR. And you'll train three hours a day. You're going to work your tails off. You still interested? Yeah. Show up a week from Saturday at 11 o'clock for the qualifying test. You'll go through a physical and a 1,000-meter ocean swim. First 15 go through the training. OK? I'll be there. Brannigan, right? Mm-hmm. I'm Carlisle. I know. I think we can win. Jury selection is the key. Jury selection is always the key. Your mother not only put me through law school, she helped me prepare for every exam. Well, I had to. He was hopeless, Joanna-- especially at real estate law. Still am. [laughter] I'm sorry I haven't had much time to spend with the two of you. But once this case is over, I'll show you around. Maybe we could drive up the coast to San Francisco? Well, um, I had something more local in mind. NANCY: You see, your daddy can't take that kind of time off, Joanna. But I could manage a couple of days. Why don't I take you up to San Francisco for your birthday? I was kind of hoping we could all go together. Well, your father and I don't take trips together anymore. Oh, right. Hey, you ready for dessert? No, thanks, Dad. I think I'm going to go for a walk on the beach alone. Well, fine with me. All right. But just don't be too long. See you later. Be careful, sweetie. Ben, she thinks we're going to get back together. Well, it's, uh-- it's natural. Most kids do. It's not natural. It is a fantasy. And fantasies lead to disappointment. I thought it led to marriage. NANCY: Yes. And then reality leads to divorce. Speaking of which, are you still involved with that stockbroker? No. The only thing he could get serious about was his mutual funds. What about you? Are you seeing anybody? Uh, yes. Claire. She, uh, works for me. Is it serious? Well, I thought so. Now I'm not sure. What happened? You came back. [soft music playing] [soft music playing] Hi, Mom. I'm going to go down to the beach. I'll see you later. OK? Well, honey, what about some breakfast? Oh, Denise is waiting for me. And I'm late. No, no. I want you to eat something now, Joanna. - OK. - Come on. Take some toast. - OK. OK. Bye, honey. Bye. Now, you swim out to that furthest buoy to your left. You turn around. And you come back in the same way you went out. As you come in, each one of you will get one of these. The first one in gets number one and so on. Now, the water temperature is about 58 degrees. So it's possible you could experience some cramps. Also, we've got a pretty good surf this morning. So stay away from the rocks. If you find yourself in any kind of problems, raise your hand. You've got a lot of people out there ready to pull you out if they have to. OK. Any questions? OK. Be careful. And good luck. Surfs up. [chatter] CARLISLE (OVER PA): Everybody ready? On your mark. [air horn blasts] [music playing] First ones should be coming in soon. Go, Brannigan. Look at that kid. I think we got our first lady lifeguard. A little young for you. [sighs] It's time a woman got the opportunity. That's all. Sure it is. CARLISLE: Congratulations. SMITTY: Brewer. Grab a towel. CARLISLE: Good swim. SMITTY: Kuma. There you are. Way to go. Brannigan, grab a towel. [laughs] Give me it. Thanks. Callahan. Callahan. - Grab a towel. All right. All right. - You're Mason, right? Yep. Five. All right. - Stratus, grab a towel. Stratus. Thanks. [heavy breathing] Hi. Way to go. Thanks. Biaggi. - Grab a towel. All right. I can't believe this. Congratulations to all of you. You did well. My name is Carlisle. And I'll be your training officer. Training starts on Monday and lasts for six weeks. The competition is June 3rd. It's not going to be easy. Our standards are high. We're going to require a lot from you, both mentally and physically. You're all in good shape. So I'm sure the competition will be intense. Now, I'm here to help. If you need any additional information, please feel free to contact me here. There are only five places. Good luck. [excited chatter] [clapping] DENISE: Look, you're just going to have to make up your mind. Either tell her, or drop out the training. JOANNA: I can't. [sighs] Look, I'll tell her that we're training for a swimming competition. It's not a total lie. She'll just assume it's for school. It might work. [music playing] [heavy breathing] CARLISLE: OK, you two. On the bicycles. [sighing] At least we're losing weight. What can I say? - Yeah. It feels great. You've got the victim to shore. His head is bleeding. What's the first step? Throw up. [laughter] You apply pressure. Right. You apply pressure with your hands to stop the bleeding. Oh, hey, you're messing my hair up. I know I'm messing your hair up, but I can't help it. Besides, you're supposed to be unconscious. I just wish I was one of the guys. You know they won't work with us unless Carlisle tells them to. [music playing] Well? Did I make it? With three seconds to spare. No, don't. I'm going to do it. You've got to work up to it. You're going to hurt your back. But I've only got a few weeks. You don't need upper body strength. Everybody weighs the same in the water. Yeah, Brannigan. And when you bring a guy in, one of us will be there to carry him. [clicks teeth] - Thanks, Callahan. - [laughs] You'll learn the saddle back carry. You could carry King Kong that way. Find the center of balance. Keep your feet about shoulder-width. Don't stand up. Good. Now let him down easy. That's it. [grunts] CARLISLE: Easy, Brannigan. OK. Callahan. Your turn. Yeah. What's the lifeguards' most valuable piece of equipment? Everybody. ALL: The rescue can. The rescue can. When should the rescue can be with the lifeguard? Brannigan? Always. Callahan, what's the basic rule of life-guarding? Watch the water. Biaggi, what's the number one cause of ocean rescues? I don't know. CARLISLE: Stratus. Riptides. Riptides, Biaggi. Riptides. OK. Go home. Study your manuals. The competition begins tomorrow. - All right. Sounds good enough. Let's go. [chatter] Hey, don't feel so bad. Come on. Listen, we'll go out tonight. And we'll party. OK? Uh, I think she should go home and get ready for the competition. [chuckles] And what are you, her keeper or something? I'll see you later, Joanna. It's OK. Yeah. CARLISLE: Brannigan. I want to talk to you. I called you yesterday. I got Biaggi. Why didn't you put your number on the application? Why did you call? Um, to tell you I think you're doing a good job. You do that with all your candidates? Well, I know the guys haven't been too friendly. And I wanted to give you some encouragement. Is that the only reason? [chuckles] Look, Brannigan, I'm interested in you because if you make it you'll be the first woman this county has hired. That's all. I know. But I thought m-- So did I. You're too young. I'm almost 18. That old? Look, Brannigan, do me a favor-- don't complicate my life. All right. Go home. Get some rest. And be here early enough tomorrow to jog two miles on the beach before the competition. Go on. SMITTY: You old heart-breaker. How long have you been there? Long enough. Are you going to be able to stay away from her? Sure. No problem. Older or wiser? [chuckles] Both. Look, I just don't want to. OK? JOANNA: So you missed one question. Big deal. I knew the answer. What? Riptides. Everybody knows that. Well-- well, why? Billy Callahan and I are dating. So? Well, after I beat him in the 200-meter swim, we had a fight. You idiot. Come on, Brannigan. Come on. Pull it. Come on. That's it. I'll be. She did it. [laughs] We've got our first lady lifeguard. [music playing] OK. Now the real work begins. If you think this is going to be a cushy job, think again. Starting Monday, you work six days a week. So don't get any ideas about vacations or weekends off. I'm not running a summer camp for flakes. People's lives are at stake here. You take your job seriously or you're out. Have a nice weekend. And I'll see you Monday. All right. [chatter] And, uh, congratulations. - Thanks. - Thanks. All right. - Take care, man. - Bye. [chatter] Brannigan. Nobody said being the first was going to be easy. NANCY: How could you do this behind my back? I asked you, you would've said no. I actually cannot believe that a kid of mine would want to spend her summer on the beach with a bunch of mindless kids. They're not like that. It's a responsible job. We're responsible for people's lives. Oh, excuse me. What about the fact that you lied to me? I didn't. I just didn't tell you. It's the same thing, Joanna. Now, you were supposed to take over from Marge this summer. How am I supposed to find somebody to do that at the last minute? Come on, Mother. There are a million people who could fill that job. That's not the point. The point is you want me to do what you want. And I'm sick of it. I'm not your shadow. And I'm not you. Come on, Joanna. Have I ever suggested that I expected you to be my shadow? JOANNA: Look, I just graduated from high school. In three months, I start college. Let me just have this summer. OK? OK. You can have the summer. Does that mean you have to spend every available minute of it at the beach? But I want to. I don't want to spend the summer in a hospital with a bunch of doctors. I want to be with kids my own age. Yeah, surfers and surf bunnies. JOANNA: They're not like that. Oh, please. Who are we kidding here? I'm doing it, Mother. For once in my life, I'm doing what I want. CARLISLE: Your senior guards are outside. They'll show you around. These are the guys you're going to be partnered with for the rest of the summer. Uh, Brannigan, yours will be here in a few minutes. OK, you guys. Good luck. All right. Let's go, guys. [claps] [sighs] I wish they'd at least talk to me. They will as soon as they feel more comfortable with themselves. I don't think I can wait that long. Jackson, I want you to meet Joanna Brannigan. Brannigan, this is Jackson Wryskiewski. [chuckles] Very good. It only took him five years to learn to pronounce it. [laughter] Jackson's the only one I call by his first name. Hey, Joanna is the rookie? Yeah, I told you I had a surprise for you. Well, she's ready to go. Show her around. Come on, Joanna, before the mobs descend. JOANNA: Have you worked this beach long? JACKSON: Well, let's see. I spent four summers here. Yeah, I like it. It's not a bad place to work. This is Station 25. It's pretty quiet over here-- mostly family types really. Surfers come down here about 5:00-6:00 in the morning. They're usually gone by about 9:30 or so. Mitra. It's one of her weddings. She doesn't believe a marriage is truly blessed unless it's performed under the sky. Is she a real minister? Yeah, I think so. My friends in Harrisburg will never believe this. [laughter] Never. This is us. 26. Home. See over there by the pier? Mm-hmm. JACKSON: That's Bikers Heaven. Be real careful. If they give you any kind of trouble, don't try to handle it alone. All right? All right. Watch your step. [chuckling] JOANNA: Getting rough out there. JACKSON: Yeah, it is. The surfers are going to lynch you, you know. Let them. It's wild out there today. We don't need any accidents. They can go surf over to Station 40. All right. Look, this is zinc oxide. It's going to be hot out there today. If you don't want your nose to glow in the dark, you better use it. Thanks. [sighs] I am going to go for a run. You take it for a while, eh? OK. [music playing] Bro, look at the lifeguard. Look at her. Whoa. Man, she is gorgeous. She is gorgeous. Damn. [laughter] Heard you pulled Brannigan, the female impersonator. Yeah, so? [laughter] Well, she's weird, man-- kind of athletic, you know what I mean? Don't you guys have any work to do? [laughs] They're crazy. After high school, I bummed around for a while, came down here, built dune buggies, sold them, made enough to take flying lessons. Do you own your own plane? [chuckles] Do I look like a millionaire? [laughs] No, I flew for other people. I even taught for a while. Will you take me flying some time? Nope. Don't do that anymore. Why? It's a long story. But I'll take you dune-buggying. - Great. - Next week? - Sure. - All right. - [laughs] [music playing] [laughter] You want to try it? I've never driven a stick before? Oh. Well, how old are you? - 17-- almost 18. - Come on. You need to try this. (PLAYFULLY) Ugh. [laughter] All right. All right. All right. Now, you put the left foot on that. That's the clutch right over there. OK? - Uh-huh. Clutch. - The other one on the brake. That one. That's the brake. [laughter] - OK. Now pull this out. - OK. Hit that. [engine revs] [music playing] Everyone's restless and ready for fun. And everyone's hoping they're going to find a summer love. They want to find someone now. Someone to share the fun now. Romancing in the sun now. The fun has just begun. I know I'm going to make it on my own. But that doesn't mean I'm going to do it all alone. Summer's here. JACKSON: When you fly, you see things that people on the ground never see, like a rainbow. I've seen a rainbow. In the sky, a rainbow's in a complete circle. You fly right up to it. And your shadow goes in the center. And then you fly around the perimeter of it. Then you just go right through it. It's unbelievable. [chuckles] Then you just start to laugh. And you know you are never going to come back down again. Then you notice you're running out of fuel. You don't care. Then you start to fight with yourself. And finally you just bring her right back down again. [sighs] You finished? Yeah, I think so. Joanna, that is really good. Thanks. You going to be an artist? No. A doctor. I didn't even know you were interested in medicine. [light chuckle] I'm not. You mind explaining that? Sure-- When. You explain to me why you're not a pilot. Another time. So you'll be an engineer who should be a pilot. And I'll be a doctor who should be an artist. My decision was made for me. [sighs] So was mine. Movie starts at 8:00. Want to catch a bite first? - Great. Do I have time to go home and change? Sure. I'll run you home. OK. Jackson, I got some bad news. Perry is out. Sick. I'm going to close down 25. Can you keep the store open here for a couple more hours? - OK. - It's OK. I'll stay. Uh, we only need one guard this late. I'm volunteering. It's not a good idea. I'll see you tomorrow, Brannigan. Sorry. It's OK. You sure? Mm-hmm. [laughter] MAN: Hey, she's going over here. She's going over here. - Come on, you guys. Leave me alone. Come on. Give me my-- no! [chatter] [ominous music playing] - Yeah, yeah. Get her in a circle. Get her in a-- [chatter] MAN 1: Throw it. Throw it. MAN 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah. [chatter] - Hey. - I got it for you. I got it for you. We got company. Give her her stuff now. Let me tell you something, pal. You watch yourself on my beach. I can't run you off as long as you mind your own business. But you pull a stunt like this again, and you're going to have me to deal with. That frightens me, Carlisle. It really does. Uh-huh. DENISE: Joanna. Hold on. Joanna. Joanna. Joanna, you have got to say yes. No. Look over there. Finally some guys with some money. He and his friend want to meet some women. Not interested. Oh, please, Joanna? This means a lot to me. Please? Where's Callahan? Oh, come on. We're talking men here. Look, look. It's just for some drinks. OK? - I can't. Look at me. I'm not even dressed. You look great. Look, they're real nice. Tim and Roy. That's Roy over in the car. He's mine. OK? [laughs] - [chuckles] If Jackson finds out, I s-- He won't. Don't worry about it. Come on. Let's go meet them. [music playing] TIM: I told Roy the best looking girls are from Southern California. You can pass. Hey, that's a compliment. I'm sorry. Thank you. Uh, I hope that's not for me. Don't tell me you want another Virgin Mary? It's, uh, time to grow up. Eventually. Not tonight. Try it. You might like it. I don't think so. Come on. [laughs] Oh, OK. [laughs] Oh, you bad boy, you. [laughs] Denise, come on. Let's go home. No, I like it here. You can go if you want. But I'm staying. [laughs] I'll see you later. Bye. Hey, hey. Where are you going? I'm going home. Your, uh, girlfriend's a lot friendlier. She's also a lot drunker. Let me tell you something. I don't like looking like a jerk. Roy said you were going to spend the night. I don't even know you. Well, you'll know me better in a few hours. [slap sounds] [car pulls away] [door shuts] Joanna? Oh, hi, honey. How was it? Total death. Oh, I'm sorry. What happened? Do you want to talk about it? No. I'm going to go to bed. Goodnight. Goodnight, honey. Oh, wait a minute. Joanna, come back. Your friend Jackson called. Did you tell him where I was? Well, yeah. I said you were out on a date. Mother. Honey, you have to tell me if I'm supposed to run interference. Perfect end to a perfect evening. Hi. Sorry I missed you last night. Mom said you called. Denise met these two guys. And we-- I don't want to talk about it. OK? I didn't even want to go. [laughs] Like, it was no big deal. They were creeps. I left early. That's not the point. I'm going to go for a run. You take it for a while. [soft music playing] Are you all right? Are you all right? [music playing] WOMAN 1: She went out too far. She went out way too far. I saw her. [chatter] MAN: Call that other lifeguard. [chatter] Wave that truck down. WOMAN 2: (CRYING) Please. Please breath. Please. Please do something. Is she all right? SMITTY: Come on. Come on. Breath for me. Come on. Ah, good girl. Good girl. [coughing] She's going to be all right. You're going to be all right. She's going to be fine. She'll be all right. (CRYING) Thank you. [siren sounding] She's OK. She's going to be OK. Good work, Smitty. What happened? It was your station. I just wasn't fast enough. It was my fault. I was on duty. Jackson was on a break. OK, Brannigan. My office. Five minutes. [soft music playing] What happened? I'm sorry. That's not an answer. I only looked away a second. You know the first rule-- keep your eye on the water. What the hell is going on with you? [sighs] Jackson and I got in a fight. [sighs] That does it. I'm transferring you. No, please. I promise it won't happen again. I can't risk it. Come on. Give me another chance. For once in my life, I'm doing something really important. And you blew it. OK, Brannigan. You so much as blink the next time, and you're out. You understand me? If that kid had drowned, it would have been your fault. Smitty saved her life-- and your neck. [soft music playing] Now you've got two reasons to be mad at me. You think you're the first who looked away at the wrong time? But what if Smitty hadn't been there? But he was. Hey, I'm sorry. I acted like a jerk. I was jealous. That's silly. I mean, there's nothing to be jealous about. I'm possessive. You're just going to have to get used to it. And if I don't? I'll probably fall in love with you. [soft music playing] Watch the water, Brannigan. [chuckling] So then when we came by the reviewing stand and General Whitcom was saluting-- Uh-huh. --we all dropped our pants. [laughs] That was the end of military school. I guess they got the message. Yeah. My dad was ready to kill me. But my mom was pretty happy to have me come home. And then came college? Not exactly. [music playing over radio] He's adorable. Who is he? That's my son Patrick. How I spent my summer vacation-- getting my 16-year-old girlfriend pregnant. Did you marry her? Sure. I became a family man at 18 and a divorced man at 20. Well, what happened to her? Carol? Mm-hmm. Her luck finally changed. She met a great guy, married him. He adopted Patrick. And now they live in Palo Alto. Well, do you see him? Whenever I can. Steve's his father now. And Carol doesn't like me coming around too much. And that's it. After that, I hung around for a while and learned how to fly. I can't. I'm sorry. I guess I'm just not ready yet. It's no rush. Come on. I'll take you home. Why the hell did you come back? To drive me crazy? Ben, you are involved with somebody. We had a fight. So what? That doesn't end a relationship. What are you coming around me for? I thought you wanted me? Not like this. Not on the rebound. BEN: [inaudible] I gave you a call. I told you I was coming over. CARLISLE: The problem is that you were with your girlfriend. BEN: Well, why is that such a problem? NANCY: Oh, get out of [inaudible].. BEN: You knew about-- you knew about her. It's quieter at the Gib. NANCY: Why do you think I moved here [inaudible]?? Why-- what-- who-- and who suggested that I pick up my life and move it out here? BEN: You've only been here a short time. Give this a chance, honey. NANCY: Two months. I don't know-- [music playing] [chatter] Here you go. Ooh. Looks good. Hello, stranger. Denise, hi. How are you? I haven't seen you around. You've been busy, huh? Well, I've been busy with work and all. How about you? How is your summer? Um, it's OK. Not what I really hoped for. But that's OK. Hi, Jackson. Hi. Well, um, I got a guy on the dance floor. So I'll give you a call. OK? [laughs] - OK. - Bye. - Bye. Goodbye. [dance music playing] You were out late last night, honey. I was out dancing with Jackson last night. Jackson? You're getting awfully serious about that boy, aren't you? Mom, he's not a boy. He's a man. He's 24. 24? Oh, come on, Joanna. Now, honey, that is way too old for you. Don't start. OK? OK. Thank you. Guess what? I'm going to take you up north for your birthday. First, we'll go to Monterrey, then spend a night in Santa Cruz, and then right on up the coast to San Francisco. Mom, it sounds great. But I can't go. Why not? My job. I can't take the time off. I'm just a rookie. God, Joanna. Come on. That's only a temporary job, isn't it? No. I don't want to. Besides, I'd rather spend it here with you, and Jackson, and Daddy. Well, I don't believe this. Ever since we moved to California, you've been talking about nothing but how much you want to see San Francisco. I'm sorry. I just don't want to go. OK? Yeah. Well, it seems that you don't know what you want. I'm going to work. I'll see you later. Oh, come on, Joanna. So I told Jamison if he's going to turn the place into a cat house, he can just get out. Well, you're cramping his style, Carlisle. Yeah, that's what he said. Tough. Oh. Yeah. But now the place is empty, right? Well, my sister will be back in September. I'd rather have it empty than to have the cops there every night. Brannigan, speak. She's having trouble at home. What's the problem? JOANNA: My mother. Everything's gone wrong for us since we came out here. And she's taking it out on you. I'm the only one around. Eh, you'll be going to college this fall. Wellington. It's a whole 15 minutes away from our house. So you can live at the dorm. Not if she can help it. Brannigan, you're not a kid anymore. Tell her what you want. I just wish she wasn't so unhappy. I feel so guilty when I don't do what she wants me to. You're not responsible for her happiness. It's easy for you to say. You don't have to live with her. JACKSON: You don't have to live with her either. Just tell her straight out, like you tell me. Mm? I need to get some air. Uh, you want some coffee? No, thanks. You think she's all right? Do I look like I understand women? [chuckles] I'll take it. Mm? The house. Your sister's place. I'll take it. - Oh. [chuckles] [door opens and closes] Are you still mad about San Francisco? Well, I-- I'm not mad exactly, Joanna. I guess I'm just a little bit disappointed. I think I was looking forward to that trip more than I'm willing to admit. Mom. Mm-hmm. I'm going to be house-sitting for a friend-- a little beach house nearby. Honey, you're only 17-years old. I'm almost 18. Oh, great. That makes all the difference. Come on. You're being unfair. Fair has nothing to do with this, Joanna. Well, I'm doing it anyway. Then what are you asking me for? Because I want you to understand. No, you want me to agree. You want me to give you my blessing. Will you? I can't. Dad, she's got my whole life planned-- college, medical school. I don't even want to be a doctor. BEN: Why didn't you tell us that? I didn't want to disappoint her. You were dishonest with her. That's going to hurt her more than anything. I need time away, a place of my own where I can go and think. Tell her. I can't. Will you tell her? Forget it. You want to be treated like an adult, act like one. She'll be so hurt. Stop treating her like some delicate flower that-- that to be protected from the harsh realities of raising a teenager. The two of you are so alike. But there's one difference-- she was always honest with everybody. [soft music playing] You're right. [sighs] [music playing] [knocking] Hi, Tod. Hi. You live around here? Well, your, uh, buddy Carlisle told me where I could find you. Oh. [chuckling] Well, can I come in? Oh, sure. Come on in. OK. You're my first guest. Can I get you something to drink? Orange juice? Soda? Eh, nah. You, uh, living here alone? Yeah. House-sitting for a month. I'm still getting used to it. I've never slept alone in a house before. [laughs] If you get nervous, I make house calls. [chuckles] So what are you doing here? Well, I came to take you out. Now, I thought we'd go up to Newport Beach and have a little dinner. I can't. I'm sorry. I've got a date tonight. No problem. We can be back by 6:00. I'm sorry, Tod. I'm seeing somebody. That guy I saw you with at the Gib? Jackson. Serious? I think so. [sighs] Lucky guy. [light chuckle] Well, if you ever break off with Jackson, you know where to find me. [chuckles] The Gib? Most nights. [chuckles] OK. Bye. Bye-bye. [chuckles] [knocking] JACKSON: Joanna? - Yeah. JACKSON: One second OK. - Close your eyes. - What? Close your eyes. OK. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? Walk down here. [laughs] All right. You can sit down. I'm down. Can I open? No, wait. Now. Happy birthday. Oh. Go ahead. What are you waiting for? - You baked this? - Yeah. I've been trying to tell you, I'm evolved. OK. Here I go. [blowing] [blows] [laughter] [soft music playing] It's a gossamer albatross. It's the only human-powered airplane ever built. The guy who invented it flew it across the English Channel. See, he pedaled until the wind lifted the wings off the ground. It's incredible. Anybody can do anything if they want to do it badly enough. Then why don't you fly anymore? I'm going to get a beer. Do you want anything? I want an answer. I have many Meniere's disease. It affects my balance. And it can make me dizzy. And the FEA took my license away. Do you still have this-- what's it called? It's called Meniere's disease. Yeah, sometimes. But I can compensate for it. See, I know that up is up and down is down Even. If it feels the other way around. I just go with what I see and not what I feel. And it works-- most of the time. Don't feel sorry for me. This isn't a big deal. It's not the end of my life. Anybody can do anything, even peddle across the English Channel. [doorbell rings] Oh, hi, Ben. Listen, I'm sorry. But the birthday girl's having dinner with her boyfriend. Um, this is for the girl who set the record for the fastest delivery, Mother's Hospital, Harrisburg, 1966. It was fast, wasn't it? Very peasant like. You should have had 12 more. Kids? Forget it. I can't handle the one I've got. Uh, why don't you get dressed? I'm taking you out to dinner. Without Joanna? Who needs her? We had a good time before she came along. Well, I know, Ben. But that was 18 years ago. I have a great memory. Our reservation's at 9. OK. Give this a drink. And I'll get dressed. [chatter] MAN: Hey, get back here and look at that girl in [inaudible].. [laughter] WOMAN: [inaudible] blowing over here. Fantastic. MAN: Here comes the lifeguard. [laughter] Hey, I'm sorry. But there's no drinking on the beach. You'll have to leave. Hey, baby. I'm glad you're here. We're having a party. I mean it. You'll have to leave. Hey, Brannigan is going to need some help. [chuckles] The lady wants us to leave. But I don't want to leave without the lady. Hey, look, there's only one of me and eight of you. So it's really easy for you to give me a hard time. But I'm only doing my job. OK? Look, the rules about drinking are for your own safety. So if you want to drink, you're just going to have to go elsewhere. It's your choice. Brannigan, any problem? I don't think so. They were just leaving. No way. I think you'd better go. I'll catch you later, man. Anytime. Thanks. I'm really glad you guys are here. Hey, you're doing pretty good on your own. Very impressive. I couldn't have done better myself. [inaudible] Jackson. - Yeah. - See you later. Back to the station. All right. Yeah, me too. See you later. Were you scared? A little. A lot. [laughs] Well, it didn't show. BOY: (SINGING) Joanna, I love you. I love you. Hey, hey. Hey, Joanna. Do you want to go out with me. Hey, I've got tickets to The Police concert. Hey, Donny. It's my girlfriend you're hitting on. What are you doing? (CHUCKLING) I'm only kidding, Jackson. (CHUCKLING) Oh, yeah? Well, you better watch out. I get pretty jealous. JOANNA: He's going to be adorable in about 10 years. Yeah, I'll worry about him in about 10 years. [laughs] Is that the boyfriend? Yeah, that's Jackson. BEN: Serious? NANCY: I think so. She's not talking about it. She's so beautiful. But for me, she's-- she's frozen in time. She'll always be 12-years old. For me, she'll always be three-months. No wonder we drive her crazy. Not we, me. WOMAN: Somebody's drowning out there! See that? MAN: Hey, help that guy! [chatter] WOMAN: There she goes. She's running into the water. Ben! [intense music playing] [chatter] [siren sounding] Paramedics are on their way in. How's he doing? Can a doctor get into the act? Mom? I think you're going to be all right, sir. [music playing] Oh, honey. I'm so proud of you, Joanna. Thanks. We have a tradition, Brannigan. When a rookie save a life, they become a senior guard. They have all the rights and privileges of a senior guard-- [chuckles] But no raise. [laughter] Take off your rookie's jacket, Brannigan. MAN: All right. [clapping and cheering] [soft music playing] Do you know what we're doing? Yes. We're having an affair. [chuckles] The last time we had one, I got pregnant. Maybe we were too young. Maybe. You're not sorry you married me, are you, Ben? No. I'm only sorry I couldn't make you happy. What time is it? Time to get up. [chuckles] [groans] No. [chuckles] I think I'm going to go for a swim. OK. I'll take my break later. What's the matter? It's OK. Well, what's wrong? Dizziness. Meniere's disease, that's what happens. I'm going to go in. - Don't go in. What if it comes again? I know how to handle it. In the water? Anywhere. OK. But be careful. [ominous music playing] [intense music playing] [chatter] MAN: Hey, somebody help that guy out there. WOMAN: Isn't that the lifeguard? [coughing] Take it. Get out of here. I don't need it. Don't be a hero, Jackson. Take it! We're going in. Come on. You'll be OK. Come on. [coughing] Come on. [phone ringing] Yeah. I'll be right there. It's probably the flu. I had it last month. It lasts 24 hours. Then it's gone. Only feels like 24 years, huh? You know, you're in luck, Jackson. If that had been my girl, I'd have been feeding the fish. He's all right. Get in the truck. I'll drive you home. [knocking] [clears throat] Hi. How are you feeling? Great. I tried calling you. And there was no answer. I got a little worried. Can I get you anything? Do me a favor, take the nurse act somewhere else. You're a real doll, you know that? You got a minute? CARLISLE: Sure. Sit down. I want to transfer. I don't want to work with Joanna anymore. You two have a fight? None of my business. That's right, it isn't. CARLISLE: Look, Jackson, I know what's going on with you. You freaked because you got dizzy. But you're the best I've got. This is my last year anyway. I'm going to graduate next year. And after that, I'm going to be working full-time. You'll be missed. Yeah. Who are you going to put me with? I don't know. Uh, you and Samuels can switch. Thanks. CARLISLE: You know, she was frightened for you. She didn't understand. I don't need that. [sighs] [soft music playing] JOANNA: I don't know what's wrong. He won't even let me near him. CARLISLE: He didn't like you pulling him out of the water. He was sick. He could have drowned. No, he wouldn't. He's too good a swimmer. And he's had this illness long enough to know what to do about it. You know about it? Yeah, he told me when he first got the job. I took a chance hiring him. But he's never let me down. He's so strong. I wish I had half his strength. [chuckles] He thinks the mind can move mountains. You know, he's something of a loner. You're the first woman he's ever really cared about. I love him too. That's why I was scared. You saw his weakness. And you didn't let him handle it. I thought he needed me. Brannigan, you don't know much about men, do you? [chuckles] Come on. They took his license away. And he had to quit flying. Then yesterday, he got dizzy in the water. Well, it can come and go very quickly. But if his symptoms persist, I'm afraid he's going to have to have an operation. Mom, he is so mad at me. Carlisle says it's because I saw him weak. But I know Jackson. That's not like him. No, I think it's probably part of the illness. You see, there are psychological changes that go along with Meniere's disease-- withdrawal, irritability, depression. That's him. Do you want to help him, honey? Yes, I'll do anything. Then don't baby him. Give him all of the encouragement and support that you can. But don't let him get away with anything. He's very strong, Mom. Carlisle says he learned to compensate for the attacks. He works through them. I know that you care for him, Joanna. But you can't be his nurse-- or his whipping boy. [soft music playing] [knocking] [knocking] [dance music playing] Hey. No boyfriend tonight? I think it's over. Great. Let's dance. [clapping] [dance music playing] Emma, I love you. You're the one, the one for me. I'm in love. And I won't lie. She's my girl, and always on my mind. She gives me the love, the feeling that's right. You like blondes? Susie? Nah, forget it. It's one dance. I'm going to talk to him. I, uh, thought it was over? It is-- for him. Joanna, you're trouble. (CHUCKLING) Come on. I'll be eternally grateful. I'll, uh, take one night's gratitude. Please? [sighs playfully] Come on. C-- can we switch partners? Hey, I'm only, uh, following orders. Come here. I want to talk to you. I don't have anything to say about it. Just a minute, Jackson. It's no big deal. What's the matter with you? Why won't you talk to me? Maybe I don't want to. OK? Don't push me away. I've got a date. I'll see you around. Take her for a ride. Everything's fine. You, uh, want to talk about it? No. Come on. Why don't you let me cheer you up? Tod, I can't. I'm sorry. Look, don't tell me your boyfriend didn't get you in the sack? Well, what if he did? I love Jackson. [laughs] Oh, and, uh, that makes a difference? Doesn't it? Not to me. That's too bad. [soft music playing] [engine starts] [car pulls away] [clapping] All right. Woo! Bye, Samuels. I'm sorry you can't stay and play with us. Well, somebody's got to watch the store, eh? [laughs] I just want to say it was really nice working with you this summer. Yeah, same here. JOANNA: OK. SAMUELS: OK. JOANNA: Bye. JACKSON: Look, I'm just going to take off. I'll stay in touch. All right? You know, for a smart guy, you're really a jerk. Anything else? No, that's about it. See you around. How you doing? I'm OK. Good. Any good at volleyball? [chuckles] Really bad. Too bad Jackson took off. He's a strong player. I'm not interested. Let's play. [knocks lightly] Hi. Come in. CARLISLE: Hi, ya. Gee, the place looks terrific. My sister isn't going to recognize it. I just cleaned up. That's more than she's done in the last few years. This is for you. I wanted to say thank you for being a great teacher and a good friend. [light chuckle] It's very good. Thank you. You're welcome. Um, you start college next week. I don't know. I'm not sure if I want to. Carlisle, what do you want to do with your life? Oh. I'm doing it. Really? Yeah. After Vietnam, I just wanted to be where the sun was shining and people were having a good time. No burning ambition? Ah, hell, I'm 35-years old. I'm in great shape. Got a job I like. I'm getting my money's worth. You think it's OK to want so little? [laughs] It's a lot, Brannigan. I'm happy. I'm doing what I want. Not many guys my age can say that. [music playing] Joanna, honey, this was delicious. - It's really good, honey. - Yes, it was. [chuckles] I'm glad you liked it. So how come Jackson didn't join us? Isn't he feeling any better? Uh, I really don't see Jackson anymore, Mom. - Oh. - I'm going to make some coffee. Would you like that? - That would be great. Thank you. - OK. I'll take this. Oh, let me get the door for you. Great. NANCY: Remember when she used to do that as a kid? How she would sit and stare in the mirror for hours? [chuckles] Drawing, staring, drawing. NANCY: Made us so nervous we should've had Dr. Spock living with us. [chuckles] She's good, isn't she? Yes, she is. It's great to have a hobby. I've always regretted that I had to give up my music. It's not a hobby, Mother. It's what I want to do with my life. I know it comes as a surprise to you because we never talked about it before. But it's something I've wanted for a long time. I'm an artist. That's just the way it is. I know you're disappointed in me. But it's what I want. I'm going to art school in Los Angeles. Wish me luck? Of course I do, Joanna. It's just that I'm so afraid I'm going to lose you. I know. But you've got to let me go. I'll come back. But you've got to let me go. Oh, Joanna, I love you so much. I know, Mom. And I love you too. [soft music playing] Don't come in with me tonight, Ben. You're tired of me already? Well, no, it's not that. I just want some time to think about everything. About Joanna or about us? About everything. See, I know now that Joanna's not coming back. And I've never lived by myself. I went from my dad's house to your house. And then I lived with Joanna. I don't even know what it's like to live alone. It's no fun. Well, maybe not. But I think I better try it. See, if I live with you again, I want it to be because I want to, not because I'm afraid to be by myself. I may not be around when you're ready. Please don't say that, Ben. It's just that my kid grew up. I think it's time I did the same. [soft music playing] [cheery music playing] I wouldn't blame you if you never talk to me again. I wouldn't blame me either. [light chuckle] I have been a jerk. No argument. It's yours. [soft music playing] I want you to have it. You can't stay mad at me. [chuckles] I wouldn't count on it. Can I see you again? Well, I'll be in Los Angeles. I'm going to Otis. When did this happen? When you left me. Jackson, I was counting on you too much. You're everything to me-- all my dreams, everything. And when you weren't there, I didn't have anything. I want you with me. Aren't you afraid of getting too close. I'm only afraid that you won't. I want to make you happy. Jackson, you're not responsible for my happiness. I am. [soft music playing] [music playing] [ambient music playing]
