I think it's his twin brother's. Would you like to do a workout, Jack? I'm going to be lazy today, honey. But I'll watch you. You can teach me. Okay, well, it's simple really. First of all we raise to the tip of our toes and back down again. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Okay. Then we lay on our side and we lift our leg. One, two, three, four, five, six- - That is so cute. Do I look silly, Jack? Honey. No, you don't look silly. You look beautiful. You always look beautiful. I just thought maybe we could do nothing together, that's all. No, Jack, I must get changed. I've been wanting to try this new Bolognese sauce forever and ever, only 150 calories per serving and only $2 a jar. Would you like mushrooms in it or not? I think I'll pass, honey. I'm not really a huge fan of mushrooms if that's okay. Mushrooms it is then. Okay. You know, Ria, apart from the mushrooms, this pasta is probably the best I've ever had in my life. - Thank you, Jack. - Delicious. More wine? Cheers. So are you looking forward to your show tonight? Of course. I've been waiting all week. I know. Well, I had an idea. I was thinking instead of you watching your show this week like you do every week maybe we can do something different, something fun just the two of us. I think I'll watch my soap after all. Of course. This washing up liquid lasts forever and ever. I certainly believe the manufacturers and... Honey. I think I'm gonna wait in the other room for you okay? Oh my God, Steve, we can't keep doing this. What? It doesn't matter what we want. We're hurting people, people that we love. Don't you think I know that? Don't you think I know I should stay away? I just can't. Oh, my brother is the luckiest man alive. He doesn't even know it. I can't, Tony, oh, Steve. I can't do this. Look, if I go, Beth, you know you'll never see me again, right? Thank you. I just couldn't bear to see my child being brought up by him. So what, you want me to just leave him? Yes. Your brother's not that bad, you know. After all, he has put a roof over both of our heads. Well, if that's what you want, you don't want me. Yes. No. You just don't get it, okay? Get what? Oh, Steve. I love both of you. Equally. Good morning, world.

We all dream of having a clean house but who dreams of doing the cleaning? A good housewife, that's who. Huh? What was that? You know what? I've been thinking.

I certainly believe the manufacturers when they say it out-washes all other competitors. Hey, Ria, I think you're gonna love these drinks. Although I wanna be an actress, I've spent most of my career working in bars. Shaken, not stirred. I told you, Beth. I told you I wasn't gonna stand for this bullshit no more. Well, you killed him! Why did you have to kill him? Because nobody makes a fool out of Tony Mendoza and gets away with it. Not even his brother. But he loved you. He respected you. What? It was just bad timing that we fell in love. No! Whatever that was it's done. Okay? Now shut your mouth, clean this place up, and help me get rid of the body. What? I can't. My condition.

You were actually one of the best we've ever had. I thank you. Foxtrot four, the house is green and we are ready to go. Thank you, indigo foxtrot three. J1201 is traveling and you are clear to leave when complete. Really? Do you have to tell them that bullshit? What, that she's the best we've ever had? Come on, she was. Yeah, right. We're good to go. Come in, Jack, come and get- - Hey, wait! Is this it? What do you mean "is this it"? I don't mean to be rude but so far this whole experience is not what I expected. I won the grand prize. I don't get what you mean, mate. I was driven all the way out here by that rude son of a bitch who you call a driver and he didn't give me any instructions on what I was supposed to do tonight. I know, it's okay, sir. - All you need to do- - Oh, come on. is get into bed, get some sleep, and in the morning everything will be clear. I don't know about that. Good morning! It is Monday, the 19th of March, 2040 and we have two very special guests, Mitchell Lawrence and Robert Stewart-Oaten creators and respective producer and director of "A Day with Ria". Good morning. Morning. Thanks for having us. No worries. So it's been four years and five series and the show just keeps getting better and better. Mitchell, tell me, what is the secret? Well, it's actually quite hard for me to answer. It's the guest stars we have and the scenarios we put them in that makes it very watchable and unique. Now, Robert, you have won countless awards for your directorial style during the show. But, at the same time, you've been criticized for creating a show that some say runs itself. True, but what most people fail to understand is the complexity and ever-changing nature of an unscripted show. I mean sure, Ria follows her own script but the contestants or husbands, if you like, I mean, we never know what they're going to do. Yes, of course. So how on Earth do you keep track of everything that goes on in that house? With a lot of skill and aided by the most up-to-date technology. We have about 250 cameras planted all over the house some as high def and precise as this. - Oh! - And others as small and discrete as this. This little camera is 8K in quality and my absolute favorite to shoot with. The others are so big and obtrusive that the husbands always know they're on. Whereas those little babies, so small and unobtrusive, you get to the real soul of a contributor. Come on, you're not into "Ria" are ya? Shh. I love it. It's my one and only guilty pleasure. The only one? Well. Hey, Jess, I was wondering if... Sorry, John, you were saying. Vice President Flemming is also a fan of "A Day with Ria". As Vice President Chief of Staff, you know full well I couldn't possibly comment on that. Now the audience are in control, voting over everything that happens in the house from what Ria wears that day to what they both eat. In fact, every time there is a question or a decision posed in the house, Ria and the audience are integral to the process. So now we have a little VT that viewers have RIAPPed most popular contributor of the series. Okay, stop the car. Okay, so I washed the dishes, I vacuumed, and then I dusted the whole house all whilst wearing this ridiculous outfit. Congratulations, Jack. You have won the right to request anything you like of me. Uh, uh, I would like to sing you a song, Ria, if that's okay. Your request has been accepted.

Absolutely. By the way, I am obsessed with the 1950s theme this series. The attention to detail is just amazing. So now I have to ask, do you think I'd look good in a Ria dress? Erika, you would look good in just about anything. Oh, stop it, you. Well, the details are- - Nothing on, audiences love about the show. Oh, in fact I can exclusively reveal that next season, we're gonna be doing something a little different. Every day Ria spends with a husband will be Christmas Day. It should be a lotta fun. Yeah, definitely for the viewer and even the husband. But what about Ria? What about her? Well, again, in the past you've been criticized with, well, with people calling the show inhumane. Good one. I'm not even gonna dignify that with an answer. Well, Robert and Mitchell, thank you so much for coming in this morning. And for fans of "A Day with Ria", you can catch this morning's episode in 30 minutes right here on Channel Six. Good morning, viewers. It's 7:03 a.m. Ria wakes up to a new day. It's now time for you to have your first choice of the day. Please use the RIAPP to choose the Scarlet Fever or the Cinderella lipstick from Fab Cosmetics. Good morning, world. What fun-filled adventures do you have in store for me today? You can also suggest the daily chores through the app, too. Ria, now back in the bedroom, is ready to get dressed. By the way, ladies, if you like anything Ria is wearing from underwear to outerwear, remember, you can find the details of the items on our website. You okay, Mitch? You haven't said much tonight. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just goddamn pissed at that presenter bitch this morning. And I know there will always be idiots protesting against Ria. True, but I kinda got used to it. I just thought you had. Of course I have. But the producers of "The Morning Show" promised me an easier ride. Well, as long as it doesn't decrease our viewing figures. You gotta be kidding. No, actually, the more controversy the better. Thank you for reminding me of that. That bitch this morning helped us out after all. I bet you those idiots screaming "free Ria" watch her every minute of every goddamn day and obsess over it. They're hypocrites. Hmm. You're right. Of course I am. Hey, trust me on this one. The more drama we bring, the more people will be against it and the more people will watch it and will love it. So you excited about tomorrow? Of course. It's been a long time coming. Awesome, man. Got anything special planned or are you just gonna improvise the whole thing? Well, they did suggest to have a party piece but I think I'm just gonna wing it. Come on in. Mr. Vice President, I have some files here that need your attention. Great. There's also an email that is addressed to you. What does it say? Honestly I don't know, sir. For one, it's locked under your personal security code and when we looked into the IP address, it flagged up as probably coming from your son. We felt it must be private. All right. Well, thank you, Jess. That'll be all for tonight. Have a good evening. - Hey, what the- - Oh my gosh! Look at that. You have to watch it. Hey! Hey, what are we doing here, huh? Just having fun? Hey, I'm sorry, sir. - I didn't mean it. - Oh my God. No, no. Right, the next one will have to be a hit and elevate our figures through the roof. I want drama, I want scandal. I want viewers on the edges of their fucking seats! Well, you're gonna love this guy then. The background checks came back with something fairly interesting about him. Oh really? Like what? He gave us a false identity. He told us his name was Jason Sampson. Okay, but why and who is he and should I be worried? I don't think so. His real name is Flemming. I don't understand. Robert shouting, "Geez he's a pig." You don't mean he's related to Vice President Joseph Flemming? Yeah. It's his son. Shit. Exactly. Hey, where is he? I wanna speak to him. Well, he just left in the car. Okay, well, let's get him on the phone then shall we? I was there for three hours. That'll be for you, Jack. It's always for the main contributor of the day. Hello and welcome. I'm Robert, the show's director. And this is Mitchell, the producer. Hi, I'm- - Jack. And yes, we know who you are really. But that doesn't change the fact that from now on you're Jack so you better get used to it. Oh, yeah, sure. Few things before we take you in. You probably know them but the rules are simple. No tech is allowed. No phones, no IPAs, no headsets, no computer bracelets, absolutely nothing. All phones and TV in the house are fake. Don't reveal the truth to her. Spoils the illusion for everybody else. No swearing, sex, or violence before 9:00 p.m. at all. It just won't be broadcast. Now, go in there and give us something new, something we haven't seen before, something that will make you a star of the season. Or even of the entire history of "A Day with Ria". Push the boundaries, make it a party. Get out from under your father's shadow. Imagine you come outta the show and the whole world cheers. They wanna party with you. It's your show, not hers. The cleaning crew in the car with you will erase all memories of the last Jack. You got a clean start. Go hit it, son. I certainly will. Hmm, that's the spirit. Okay one last form for you to fingerprint then we'll take you into the secret location, Ria and Jack's house. One last thing. What about my list? Your list of requirements, likes, dislikes, food, sexual preferences, they're all taken care of. Now go in there, son, and give us a good show. We'll be watching. Thank you. Oh, I have got a good feeling about this one. Now, how do we play the press? We gotta let them know the VP's son in our house without letting them know. It's better rank 'cause we won't cover some 33821. Who's your dad? Um, no one really. You okay down there? Oh, yeah, just little bit of cramp. Happens in the car sometimes. Sir? Good, Jess, you haven't gone home yet. Can you come back to the office please? Course, sir. Is that John? Bring him along as well. Okay. John! And we have arrived at the destination. Oh my God! It reads like a goodbye letter. What are you gonna do, sir? I don't know. What do you know about this show, "A Day with Ria"? Only that it's the most popular piece of entertainment on the planet. When was the last time you saw your son, sir? It's been a while. Look, the only thing I'm really concerned about right now is protecting this administration and keeping this quiet. I assume he's gonna be on tomorrow? Judging by this letter yes. But I don't think we should rush in too hard. Why not? The show never reveals a contestant's identity so why not see how this plays out? Don't think he's planning anything drastic. Certainly this letter doesn't prove this is gonna be a problem for you or the president. I agree, sir. Besides, the production company may not even know he's your son. And if they get the slightest hint there's something wrong, then if anything, our action rather than inaction may go against us. I don't like it but fine. But this stays right here between the three of us. There's no reason for the president to be alerted about this, not yet. That's all, thank you. Good night, Ria. Good morning, everyone. The time is 7:03 and our gorgeous Ria is waking up to a fresh day. Isn't she beautiful? Get ready, viewers. It's now time for your first choice of the day. Make it a good one. Use the RIAPP to choose the Red Devil or the Purple Rose lipstick from our friends at Fab Cosmetics. Good morning, world. What fun-filled adventures do you have in store - for me today? - Just you wait and see. Don't forget, viewers, you can also suggest the daily chores through the app as well. Come on, sleepy head. Wakey, wakey. We've got a whole day of fun to get started on. Ah, tea. Lovely. Now you have your tea and I'll get breakfast ready. What would you like, full English or continental? Wait. Hey, what's happened? What the fuck just happened? We lost the signal! I can see that, jackass! We have never in the history of the show - lost a fucking signal! - Hustle! - There's no NI. - What do you mean we lost the goddamn signal? Let me see. Okay, we're trying, we're trying. - We're trying everything- - Are we still on air? - Oh goddamn it! - We're trying, we're trying! What do you mean you don't fucking know? Read my lips. Are we still on air? I don't know. Listen, I'm trying, listen We have everything off with no explanation. Thank God we hadn't gone to the press yet. - The color bars are off air- - Huh, yeah. You're just gonna end up back directing shitty little commercials and all that. That's it, commercial. Hey, play a commercial. Now, playing the washing lotion commercial. I didn't allow myself to hear it. 20 seconds left. Cuing the garden splash stock. In the next five minutes, Oh shit. I want the TV show to air, answers to what just fucking happened. - Three- - And an extra hot cappuccino. - Two, one. - I'll have one, too. Get this guy a coffee. Now! You know what? It's off the air. I don't know how and I don't know if this was part of your son's plan but it's completely off the air and replaying old "Ria" commercials. Okay, so? This has to be good news, sir. Perhaps the production company found out who he was and pulled the plug rather than give him - a political platform. - Only a hundred calories a serving and $3 a jar. My son's a fucking idiot. This washing up liquid lasts forever and ever! But it is off the air? We need to make sure it stays off the air. Fuck. Ria, it's okay really. I don't think anyone can see us. He told me he'd be here by now. What do you have planned today, Jack, because I have chores. You don't understand what's going on here, do you? You don't have to follow your script anymore. Okay, look, let me explain. I was paid a lot of money to disrupt the show. I don't know how long we've got before anybody gets here but I have done everything that I was asked to do so why do I feel like this isn't going to plan? Are you one of those free-reared do-gooders, Jack? Maybe I don't want to be saved. So eat your breakfast, Jack. It's getting cold. Ria, stop. Let me call him. He can explain better. If that's what you think is best, Jack. Why are you calling me? Because she doesn't understand what's going on. She's acting like we're still being filmed. Trust that I have a plan. And don't call me again. You know what? These secateurs were a great buy from the Garden Depot. - It's Ben isn't it? - Are coming back online now. We should have the picture of the two up to 250- - Can you play back the moment when Ria brings Jack his morning drink? The moment just before we lost the image. There, see it? Zoom in on that. Camera 45 is offline. What the hell? Over the angles. There's a better angle- - Yep, yep. I understand, Director, and I assure you the Vice President will be eternally grateful. Of course, madam. I'll pass you over now. Sir, your wife would like a word. Hi. Yeah, I'm... Yeah, yes, of course I've been watching. Honey, would you calm down please? Believe me, I have everything under control. Yeah, I know. Honey, honey. Do you believe in me? Do you believe I'll get it done? - That doesn't sound good. - I'll get it done. I know you're worried. Well, what do you expect? How did it go with the FBI? - It was difficult. - I don't think it's a real thing. Because I couldn't tell him we knew who today's husband is. I see. - It's probably some stunt. - Better you than me. - Thanks. - Publicity for this television show. Believe me, I have it all under control. I knew you'd be in here next. And you can stick to your script if you want. It's fine by me. All the cameras are off anyway. Just answer me this. Do you understand me now? Of course I do, Jack. Time for a quick break, Jack, and then back to it. I don't understand. Why, Ria? I'm sorry, Ria. Sir, I can get you pictures in seven, six, - five- - Okay, good. End commercials on her count. But, sir, we can't. - Just do it. - Three, two, one and we're live. Get it off air now! No, call the police to the house. That way we're covered. What, no. It will take the police over three hours to get there. Exactly. Just do everything we're meant to do. Just take your time about it. Back online. Okay, guys, so what are we waiting for, huh? We got a show to make. Now, come one, gimme a shot of Jack. Gimme a closeup. That's the best angle I got, sir. Okay that's good enough. Now, bring in some music. Make it slow and intense. Cuing track D30. Oh, that is it. This is what I call sexy television! Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for going off air earlier. That was out of our control. However, images you are seeing are live. The current Jack in the house is, we believe, taken hostage. Ria, you don't have to do this. I'm on your side. The guy who paid me he loves you. He wants to free you from all of this. He must have a lot of expendable resources, too. What do you mean? What I mean is, think about it. I'm sure I'm not the only person he paid to get me in this house with you today. The TV show has a lotta stringent security and background checks, not to mention getting me fast tracked to the full audition phase. It's all a part of the plan. And he did all this for me? Yes. As I said, he loves you. No, of course I do, Jack. Let me ask you a question, Jack. Who do you think you're talking to now? And, in fact, I think you've done too much talking already. Stop her! Give us some good news. What's going on with her? - Oh, well, you see- - Mitchell. Hello, Tonya. So is she being hacked from the outside using that cell phone? What phone? You don't know about the phone? How did they get a phone in here? I don't know. Sir. There is a call waiting for you. Nope, I said no phones. Now is not the best time, kid. - Uh, sir, it's important. - No, no, no. I think you better take it. Rob, did you know anything- - Sir! This call, it's from the White House. Just a minute and I'll pass you over to the Vice President. I've got the producer, Mitchell Lawrence, for you, sir. Speakerphone please. Mr. Lawrence, this is Vice President Flemming. I'm sure you know exactly why I'm calling. Firstly, my condolences, sir, on the dreadful turn of events on the show today. I promise we're trying to get your son out as best as we can. I've been told that it's not within her capabilities or programming to harm anyone. She just hit him on the head, tied him to a chair, and is threatening him with a knife. I think you and I have very different ideas about what constitutes harm. No, sir. What I meant was mortally. There's no way that she could kill. All right, I'm not gonna ask you to pull the broadcast again because people will ask too many questions. But I'm sure if this does go south, you have your own set of rules which will cover what can be shown. Of course. All right, well, what I do want is for this to be kept quiet. Look, we both know that the only way the press will find out who he is is if you or I tell them. And I can guarantee you that I will not be telling them. So will you? Sir, we only found out his true identity a few hours ago. He lied to our team and- - I think you misunderstood the question, Mr. Lawrence. Are you gonna tell the media that my son is in your goddamn house? No, sir. If the media find out that our current Jack is the son of the vice president, I guarantee it hasn't come from anybody at this production office. Now, Jack, let me tell why you are here. You're not here to save me. You're here purely for revenge. Not for Ria, but for me. You see, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for being loyal followers throughout the years, but now it's time for some change. You see, the makers of this TV program have become rich by exploiting the public. Now it's time for us to exploit them. Take this man, for example. He knows what he did to keep his little secret safe. Mr. Lawrence, as you know, this administration is pushing forward a set of proposals to insure a tighter rein on the use of androids. So I would hate for my son to become the poster boy that actually puts an end to your show. Do you understand me? Sir, are you blackmailing me? I'm a very powerful man who wants his son back. And under these circumstances, should the worst happen, I sure as hell won't need to blackmail you. If it was up to me and I could, I'd walk into that house right now and pull your son out but I can't. Why not? For two reasons. Firstly, the house is over three hours away in the middle of the LA desert. Secondly, and more importantly, if we pulled him out now, the press would know something was up and start asking those awkward questions that you don't want answered. So what is your plan? At the moment, I plan to treat him just like any other contestant. We regain control of Ria, shut her down, and evacuate your son safely. The police are on their way to the house. Sir, they don't know yet but the FBI's taken over. That cuts out the LA police. Now, do you have any idea why my son is being held hostage on your show? No idea. I'm guessing it's about money. But at some point the person will contact us with demands. What other reason would anybody have to hold your son hostage? I think he's being set up. So I doubt that this guy's only motive is money. Well, fuck you, too, Flemming. Get yourself to LA and pay that production office a visit. I want this wrapped up immediately. Yes, ma'am. Fuck. Why couldn't I have had a daughter? There'll be no police, no helicopters, no negotiators or members of the public anywhere near this house. We wouldn't want anyone else to get hurt. Now I want you to realize what a perfect crime this is. You see, me, the man behind this. No point in raiding the house. I'm not there. Besides, you might hurt Jack in the process and I'm not sure your bullets would stop Ria anyway. Stop Ria anyway. And now the question comes. Is this Jack's life really worth saving? All human life is, right? Isn't it? So it's time for you to vote on Ria. You've got to know Jack over the last eight hours. I'm sure you'll have a view on him. And don't worry. It's just a test in human nature. Your votes won't really decide his fate. Shut it down! Just pull the plug on anything! Just shut it down! We can't. If we do, the broadcast will end. I'm sorry, Mitchell. I can't seem to access her mainframe. She's outta control. Tonya, you always assured us that that was impossible. Well, it is. I just told his dad, Vice President Flemming, that this wasn't possible. Well, it isn't. I mean, let me explain. Say you had a toaster and your toaster makes perfect toast. And you love that toaster. One day you decide that you're gonna get your toaster to make you a cup of coffee. Well, it's not gonna happen. No matter what you do and no matter how much you love that toaster, it's not gonna make you a cup of coffee because it has the inner components to make toast. Toast? Mm hmm. It's being investigated at their end. They're gonna send a Secret Service agent over to liaise with us. The VP's being very cagey. Dad is doing his best to make sure the press don't discover that it's his son being held hostage. Well, great one, Dad. Exactly. Never trust a politician, especially if it's your own father. He also said the Feds think someone paid him to go into the house. Which means it's probably the same person that's controlling Ria. Of course. But do you think he knows that? Nah, I don't think so. He was totally set up. Just some dumb ass rich kid. If we don't get this under control before the authorities arrive, you and I are toast. Tonya, can I ask you something? Mm hmm. Well, you said that it wasn't possible for Ria to kill. Why did you lie? Well, because sometimes people don't wanna hear the truth. They wanna hear something that makes them feel better. Oh, come on, we've got an android to hack. Now the public are currently deciding your fate. I think it's only fair we give them the full story. Did you really think Daddy's money could hide this? Help me, help me please. Help. Don't. Ah, wait, wait. This man here- - He knows what he did. - He knows what he did. He murdered my only son. He has no idea what that does to a man's world, to his family. Please. To his sanity. His father pays $9.4 million in hush money to keep his- - Little secret safe. How does he know? I don't know, Mr. Vice President. I though we covered all bases but clearly not. All I wanted was an apology. All right, get John on the phone. I want this broadcast shut down right now. Yeah, okay. Get me John. Now, remember this face. This man is a murderer. He killed my only child. No, wait, wait! This way, sir. They're just in the transmission gallery. Are they now? You pull another stunt like that and you're gonna be timing. Okay. Hi, I'm Mitchell, the show's producer. This is Rob, director. Hi. Welcome to our little hub of entertainment. So that's what you call this. Entertainment. We have a man being held hostage at a secret location that up until five minutes ago your production company wouldn't disclose to us. Robert, I asked you to help out the FBI and the authorities as much as possible. - And I- - Anyway, it doesn't matter. They're on their way now. Do you understand? We'll do whatever we can to help. Good. Did you guys know he had a criminal record before you put him on air. Oh, we did our background checks of course. But because he lied, we thought all was good. And we found out about his true identity all too late. Well, I swear we never knew anything about this so-called hit-and-run allegation. Okay, I need to see those background checks. And I need to see the footage of what she said about that hit-and-run. Excuse me, this is all very impressive. Sleeping routine. Cameras in five- - Do you guys control everything Ria does or can she think for herself? Are you talking about AI? Yeah. No, Ria, totally relies on remote control and that happens from the room downstairs. Normally anyway. There's nothing here. Okay, I'm gonna say this once. Ria is like a dangerous weapon, a loaded gun if you like. If she kills him, she can't be charged 'cause she's a robot. But she's your property. So you can be charged. Got it? Now, I suggest you pull this program right now, show at the very least you're willing to cooperate. Okay. We'll do it right away. In the meantime, may I suggest my runner take you down to the control room where you can see how she's operated. Can also take a look at the files you requested. Good. Please, lead the way. Sir, would you like to come with me? Uh, can I get you any refreshments? Tea, coffee? Okay, here's the deal. Get the team to cut the signal again- - Really, but I- - Let me finish. Once that's done, contact that kid that tried to hack our house cameras last year. Pay him to keep the broadcast going over the net. Okay, gotcha. Just bump the show. Okay, ready for round two. Sleeping routing, cameras in five. Hmm. Took them longer than I thought it would. There you are. They cut the feed, Jack. It's just me and you and- - Ria of course. Public can't hear this anymore. Cowards. Not even Daddy can help you now. Hang on, hang on, it's online, it's online. - It's online, oh! - Look, oh my God. It took me a long time to find you, Jack. But I never forget that face. And when I found out who you were and what your family did, I knew for the sake of my little boy that I had to get justice myself. No, no, no! No! Are you afraid, Jack? You should be. Do you have anything to say for yourself? Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about your son. Yeah, it's true. I had a car crash seven years ago and I had heard that a little boy had died due to my stupidity. I ran like a coward. But I knew what I'd done was wrong and I wanted to go to the police. I swear to you. But my dad he's a very powerful man. He made it all go away. And then he tried to cut me out of my own family like I was some kinda cancer. I took your money because I needed a way out, an escape. But there's no getting away from the guilt that I feel, the nightmares that I have, or the pain that I have caused you. I am sorry for your loss but I don't deserve to die. You tell me how I can make this right and I'll do it. I'm behind on my schedule. I best prepare dinner. No, please! Please forgive me! Forgive me! Watch the rest on this. I'll go get you another one. Pre-programmed or not, when I sit in this chair, Ria becomes an extension of moi. Just not today while this guy has her under his control. Relax will you? It would take a computer genius of some magnitude to break through my security. She simply cannot kill. - I hope. - End of- - Um, what's going on? Sir, the image is being streamed online. Un-Goddamn-believable. They must've hacked our camera systems, too, to keep it broadcasting to the public. Really? Don't worry. We'll take it down before it does anything. No, I can't, look! I never got to say goodbye to my son. And now it seems, your father won't get to say goodbye to his. Goodbye, son. Sir, I'm losing her tracking signal. She must be at least three miles away from the house already. The main power station, the tracker, they're both located in the house. It was designed that way so that she couldn't go too far. But if this guy's hacked those, too- - Where are your men? She's on the run. They'll never find her in that goddamn desert. She's strong and she can run really, really fast. Only God knows how far she'll get from the house by now. Sir, the FBI are here. You have a right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. The right to consult a lawyer, to have that lawyer present during questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer... Come right here. I got you. It's okay. You wanted to see me, sir? Sit down. You've been my chief of staff for two years. Worked by my side for 10. I trusted you with everything. I know it was you. He texted you while I was watching my son be murdered on your phone. I'm sorry, Mr. Vice President. I never thought he would take it that far. The years of guilt of what we did to that family- - Don't! It got to me. I'm sorry. What are we doing here, Mitch? Where are we at? Listen, my arrest is the best thing that could've happened to the show. I know, the reruns have been getting more views than ever but reruns won't last forever. Ria has been MIA for months. Everyone wants her back. No matter what we do, everyone will always want Ria. She's irreplaceable. Was she? You just worry about how to get the ratings up next season. Next season? You got that key I left you? Uh, yeah. Then what are you waiting for? Happy holidays, Rob. If you were here, you know I'd kiss you, right? You're a fucking genius. Muah! Oh, Jack, isn't the Christmas tree just beautiful? And the fairy on top is just perfect. The stockings are filled up with so many presents. Oh. I have been so looking forward to tonight's episode. It's seems to have moved the bishop. Tonight we get to find out if it's Tony's baby Come along, Jack! or Tony's twin brother's. I think it's Tony's twin brother's. Oh, Jack, I just love Christmas. I think it's my favorite time of year. Course, babe, mine, too. But in July? And now we've had Christmas dinner and Christmas drinks and now all that's left is my favorite part, your Christmas present from me. Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas. This is mad! Now has your Jack been a good boy this year? Oh, my Jack's always a good boy. Then I guess this treat must be- Sorry, Ria. I was longer than I planned. This is your end of day treat, Jack. I'm scared, Jack. What did you say? I said I'm scared, Jack. How is that possible? This whole time. You've had emotional consciousness. How could they? What are you scared of? I'm scared they'll take me back there, Jack. No. I won't let them. I also know that when you're gone I'm scared. But when you're here, I'm not. Do you care about me, Ria? I love you, Jack. I'm sorry I'm not perfect anymore, Jack. I am broken. Maybe you could get a new Ria like they did. No, no. We're all broken. That's what makes us so human. That's what makes you so very unique. 'Cause there's no replacing you, Ria. I'm damaged, too. I let hate, revenge get the better of me and I'm tired of it. How can you love me? I just do, Jack. It's David. I love David. Do it!
