(moody rock music) - We just got back from the scourging. We went to the barn, we didn't find anything useful that way. You guys go tend to the horses. (gasping) (dramatic music) - Oh my god, Trianna! (moody rock music) - Let me help you. - Thanks. In here. (crying) A little more. Okay. Chuck it in. (coughs) Lab's lookin' better, Doc. - Thank you, I'm just trying to make the best of the combinations that I have, which are more than barbaric. - We're sorry, it's the best we can do. After the war, nothing has ever been the same. They were born under ground in those caves, in those fallout shelters, And while the scientists were living in luxury, they were reeing day and night, 50 feet under ground, why-- - That's enough. Larry, Doc joined us to help our cause. She believed in what we stood for. She gave up her luxury for us. So can it. - He's right in a way, though. We're in the wrong, you guys are right. I mean, we made the chemicals to destroy the enemy and instead we made mutants and beasts. Strange beasts like those found in prehistoric times on this planet. I joined you guys to find restitution for what I've done. And try to reverse those process. What's happened to your leader? - We don't know. We saw her laying outside, bleeding to death so brought her in here to you. - Syringe. - Come on, Rachelle. - [Larry] Well Doc, what is it? - She's been bitten by a talnid. Their bite is very deadly. First it just makes them sick. And then they go into a coma. And then they rot from the inside out. - Oh my god! Then we can't save her? You mean to tell me there's no cure! - There's only one cure, and it's back in my old office in Armageddon City, and I'm forbidden to ever step foot there again. See the talnid is our baby, a genetic hybrid, a toxic nightmare. It could destroy all the people on this planet if it weren't for the fact that they only lived for an average of 90 days. - Why in Armageddon City? - Because the use of toxic chemicals has been outlawed everywhere else except for in Armageddon City. That ignorant major, Salacious Thatch, has promoted the use of genetic alterations that my coworkers still do. What Thatch plans to do is buy up all the land and build more cities so he can make more income for himself. - Whoever this Thatch is is not going to stop us from saving Rachelle, or at least me. - Me either. That fat piece of shit's not going intimidate me! He slaughtered my family that lived in Armageddon City when it was New York. My father owned his own business, he was a formal retailer. He rented out clothes to people who were in need. Thatch tried to buy my father, but my father wouldn't sell out to him. And he killed my father. I'm not gonna let him do anything else. I'm gonna barbecue his balls! - Trianna, it's up to you to save Rachelle. We can't afford to let you have a large group of warriors. We need all the protection we can get. What I want you to do, is go out, find two of your most trusted warriors, meet me at the assembly hall in 30 minutes. (dogs barking) (foreboding music) (growling) (crashing) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (growling) (screaming) (yelling) (laughing) (yelling) - [Julia] Trianna! - Trianna! Trianna! Fucker! God damn fucker! (yelling) Get him! You better stab him! (yelling) - [Man] You can go faster than that. - [Janna] Get your arm outta the way. (yelling) I don't wanna hit your arm. (yelling) - That was easy! - Mr Thatch? I'm afraid I got some bad news to tell you. - What! Spill your guts or I will! - Two more experiments got away. And they're loose in the city, what should I do? - Calm down, no big deal. We simply wait for... A few mangled bodies to show up and... If they show the right signs, or if there's any trace of the saliva in their wounds, you know cus people die here all the time. There's no need to panic anyone. We'll search the area where the bodies are found. - [Soldier] And what if they don't turn up? - We burn the files and tell we know nothing. That's it, we just, and you can go relax, play a video game, watch a good comedy like I Spit on Your Grave, that cheers me up. - Yes, sir. (laughing) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Let's tie em up to these poles. (moody electronic music) - Are you sure you can handle this battle? It's better to lose one than all of you. - No! If she dies, so does years of priceless information. And so does her child, our newest warrior. We will exceed if it destroys all but one of us. - Okay. But be on guard and utilize all the skills that you have learned through the years. May God be with you. - Everybody get their weapons, okay? Alright? Let's go. - Wait for, no no, wait for me Mama! - No, you can't go. - I wanna go! - No, you can't. - Go back in there. - The weather's getting worse, Mr Thatch. I fear it's acid rain. I don't think we're gonna have any luck. - Get me General Morbius right now! - General Morbuis? Yes sir. General Morbius! - You idiot! I'll send you down to fucking sewage waste depot! Let you wallow with all, in all the shit with our slaves! - But-- - The prisal can send you down to the disease-infected whores who work in our city's ghettos, and let them wipe the puss of your sweating, oozing sores all over you! - Hey, I just do what you told me to do! - You're gonna talk back to me! - I did what you told me! - If I wanted you to yell out at General Morbius like this, General Morbius! I can do that myself! (door closes) - You sent to the Torture Room for me sir? - Yes, Sergeant Romero has just reported that non-mutant life has entered the Nightmare Zone. I want you to take three, three men and intercept them. Oh, and-- - Armor! - Armor, yes. Pringle here has just informed me that it looks like we're going to have some acid rain. And I was wondering what kind of armor our men had, if it could take the acid rain? - The only kind of armor we have available at this point is nikad clave. It covers the head and torso area, but leaves the groin exposed. - Good job! - Yes! - Very good job, that means that they won't be having any more rugrats to run around this city! - No, no little impies. - Wipe out the sexual organs, it's gonna be a fun town. Good job, good job. - You have a good future in this company. - Very good job. - You will stay in the city. As long as you don't screw up. - Thank you sir. Now back to this non-mutant life, suppose theyre wanderers or survivors? - Terminate them. (determined music) - You know what? Hey. It really makes me made Lotus backed out on us. - Yeah, well that's a bimbo for ya. - Come on. - [Janna] I got it. - Oh god, I think I'm gonna get sick. - [Larry] You alright? - Don't do that. (exclaims) - Nasty! - Thanks. - [Larry] Hey yuck, I think it has a wallet. Be careful! - [Both] Who is it? - Oh man. (exclaims) - You know what? - [Janna] He was ugly to start out with. - It's probably some poor bastard who drank the chemical waste. - [Larry] Farmer maybe? - Oh man. - Well, just leave it there, let's go. - Come on. (dramatic music) - You ready? Careful Trianna! - Alright, come. Check on that side. - [Larry] Clear. I hear something, what is it? (shushing) - [Sapphire] Help! Help me! - What's that noise, Trianna? - I don't know. - Please! Help! Get me out of here! - [Larry] What is it? - Get me out of here! Help me! - Sapphire! (exclaims) Help me! - [Larry] I'm trying! - I thought you were dead! (dramatic music) - [Sapphire] This place is a trap, you have to leave! - [Larry] A trap! - [Janna] Come on! Don't leave her, get her up. Get up! - It's all clear. - I'll get it. - [Trianna] We gotta get out, come on! (dramatic music) (groaning) - I know they're in here. Morbius may have given up, but I'm not going to. You men ready? - [Soldier] Yeah, I smell bimbos! (shouting) - Come on through, Doug. This way. (dramatic music) - Come on, guys. - Wait stop, let me get her. Here, hold this. - You're okay, Sapphire. - [Larry] I'll pick up the weapons! - It's okay. - [Pringle] Let's go soldiers. I smell bimbos! This way! Bimbos! (yelling) - Retreat! You bimbos go that way, I'll distract them! Here, take these! - Be careful! - [Larry] Yes. (shouting) - Bimbos! (shouting) - Okay. (screaming) (shouting) (screaming) - Go over there! - [Triann] Where? - [Janna] Over there! Now! (screaming) (yelling) (swords clashing) (whimpering) - Sit down. Right here, right here. Right here. Okay. Lift your head up. You're gonna die, you need food! - Water. I need water. - Stay here. Sapphire, listen to me. Listen to me, sweetie. Stay here. You're gonna be okay. Oh my god! You listen to me! Oh shit. I'll be right back! - [Sapphire] Water. - Ya! Come on, ya bimbo! (yelling) - Come on, fight me like a man! - You want it like a man? - Yeah! - You want it like a man? (exclaims) You fight like a man, you piece of shit! (yelling) - Draw on that! - Son of a bitch! - You can't hit the broad side of a barn! Oh, my wrist! (swords clashing) (groaning) (birds singing) (groaning) (exclaiming) - Shew. - Dr West, come on. Doc, you alright? (groaning) She get you too? Come on man, come on. It's alright. It's alright. We gotta go report this to Thatch. We got to. We'll get back at them bimbos, if it's the last thing I do. Come on, it'll be alright. We'll get em back. I just had the fight of my life, too. Let's go get Thatch, tell him what Morbius did to us. (energetic rock music) - Wait. Wait. - You there? (exclaims) You okay? - Yeah. I'm alright. - Where's Julia? - Julia? Julia! - Julia! - [All] Julia! - There she is. - Julia! - You okay? - [Julia] I'm right here. Look at their weapons. - [Trianna] You okay? Well now we gotta find their weapons, too. (chatting) (pole clanks) - Here. (exclaiming) (whistling) - That's so cool, you can see your face shine! - [Janna] God! You lucky dog! - Trade ya. - No way. (moody electronic music) - Professor Thatch. General Morbius is here to see you. - Well now, let me guess. You bring me bad news. News that you fucked up another mission! - You should listen to him this time. - Alright. - So there's a small band of warriors heading up from the south. They seem barbaric in nature and extremely pissed off. They killed three of my best troopers, and they're women. - Women! Fucking women! What is this the ERA revisited! What do they want! - I don't know! They're heavily armed and very pissed off. Kinda like ninja commandos. Only with a great set of tits and a mean ass attitude. (yelling) - God, somebody in the Nightmare Zone! That's it with you, you're done, you're out! (laughs) - [Pringle] What do you plan on doing about this? - That's what they don't know, sir. You can only enter the Nightmare Zone. No one ever reemerges. - They did it once before, and they beat you! - Women only get one chance with me! Never a second! - Never raise your voice with me, ever! You act that way again, if you fuck up on this mission, that's it, your human's due and the camel mutants out there, do you understand? - Yes sir. - Good! - Now, unless you have something else to say get out of my office! - Thank you. - I'll go with him. - You do that! And if he fucks up, you bring me his head! - [Pringle] Oh he won't do that. (dramatic music) - We got five miles to the Nightmare Zone. One hour and 37 minutes of daylight left. - We better get a move on. We have got to do this for us, and Rachelle. Let's go. (mysterious music) - Let's stop and rest right here. Hey, Sapphire. (swords clashing) (grunting) (Larry talking) (dramatic music) - [Man] Go ahead, kick it down. (rumbling) - What's going on? Wait! Hold on, hold on! Hold on! Wait! It stopped. (yelling) (screaming) (grunting) (Larry grumbling) - Okay! It's dead. (celebrating) - Great job, Janna. - Leave it me to raise a little hell, literally. - We're not even there yet. The sun's setting down, so let's just turn back. - No! We have come too far! We are not turning back, we have to go. Let's start walking. I don't want to hear any complaints from anyone! - [Man] Action. (cocks gun) - If you want something right, you gotta do it yourself! (talking) - Well? Here we are guys. Armageddon City. - I swear to god, the bimbos were right here! I know I saw em! - Well where are they now? - I don't know where they are! - Where are they? - I don't know! - Well where's General Morbius? - General Morbius left us the minute we left the camp. - Well where the fuck is he now? - I have no clue where he went! - I want him brought to me, I want him dead! - He's a deserter and we gotta get the bimbos, so if you wanna grouch him get your fat ass and get him yourself, I'm going after these bimbos, buddy! (splashing) - [Thatch] Come on! (dramatic music) (talking) (yelling) (screaming) (energetic rock music) - Let him go, let him go now! Let him go! - [Trianna] Drop your weapons! - Stop, the weapons, now! Get in line, back up! (yelling) - [Sapphire] Let her go! - Give me your weapons, gimme your weapons, there. - Get back! Don't even reach for it! Stop ya little ho! Welcome to Armageddon City! We even have your rooms ready for you here. In our jail! (laughing) - Sorry, we really can't stay. We were just-- (yelling) - [Thatch] Why have you come to my city! - Well it wasn't for those warm, friendly smiles. - [Thatch] Shut up! - I think people need to line up here. Line up! Get in line! - Let go! - Shut up! - Line up, now! Now! Now! - Just let her go! - Line up. (yelling) - Can you believe this! She was trying to take the gun outta my hands! (screaming) (yelling) - [Thatch] Shut up! (talking) - [Trianna] You are sick! - Move it, keep moving! I don't wanna see anyone stopping. (exclaims) Come on, move again and I'll take this bitch out, move! Drop it. - Drop it! - Drop the weapon! (club clatters) - Alright now, get in line! Get in line! Get in line, get in line. To the door, now! - Just keep marching! Move it! (yelling) You. I got a problem with you, buddy. If you ever attack us again - Let go! I won't give you a trial - Keep walking! - Before I kick your ass! I'll cut you to pieces. And I'll feed ya to Thatch. I think you need to quit squirming now, don't you? Alright, move it! (talking) - Wait! You men take the rest of the bimbos to the cell. This pretty little butterfly goes with me. Come my dear. (dramatic music) (howling) - Oh my god, what is that? - It's a talnid. - [Lotus] Are they dangerous? - Very dangerous, they're deadly. (growling) Why didn't you go with the other girls? - I didn't feel like I was ready to go on a mission yet. Felt like I had make it my way. - Since you haven't had a lot of training? - [Lotus] No. - There you are. (groaning) Where you think you've been? - Sorry General Mr Thatch. Ow! - Get in here! - I in fact can slide in. - Well, I can forgive you this time. But this is twice you've fucked up now! - [Morbius] Sorry, sir. There are mutants everywhere. And I saw three more talnids! They're fighting the toxic waste. - So the talnid population is growing? - [Morbius] Yes sir. - Good! Exactly as a planned! - It's not my fault, sir! I can't help it if you armed me with poor men who can't seem to fight god damned women! - Just remember you're one of those men! Now, we have these women, these bimbos, down in our holding cell. I want you and Dr West to interrogate them and find out why they are here. - Then let me interrogate them! Let me find out what you want to know! - If you ever raise your voice to me again, I will kill you. Do you understand? - Yes sir. - [Thatch] Get up! - Fine. - Oh, and after you interrogate them, I want you to gather some weapons, and get my troops and meet me here in half an hour. We're going to put our plan into action. (suspenseful music) - Yes sir. (grunting) - Hello. I'm Dr West. I've been sent here to interrogate you. Now this can go easy, or it can go rough. (grunts) (laughs) Now tell me, what were you doing with the bimbos? - Well, you idiot. I'm John Apollo. I work for the Armageddon Street Patrol. And anyway, I was with those bimbos because I thought that I might try an orgy-- - Silence! Looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way. Soldier get me the truth serum, please. (coughing) - [Man] Squirt. Cool. - Hold still. (screaming) (laughs) (dramatic music) Feel better? - I have failed. - No you haven't. We have failed, not you. - This isn't over yet! Julia, how much time do we have left? - Approximately 11 hours. - That's not enough time! Even if we did leave, we still don't have enough time to get the antidote for our leader. - Dr West. Yes, Lord Thatch. Yes, we have the bimbos and they've been incarcerated. I'm questioning John Apollo. Yes. What would you like us to do with them once the questioning is finished? Ah the Nightmare Zone. Excellent. Okay, thank you. Now, tell me the truth. What were you doing with the bimbos? - A woman named Daria Solomon, (dramatic music) you call her Doc. She used to work with you. But she had the guts to get out. You didn't. - Soldier, leave me with this man. I'll finish him. - Even when you knew what that fat bastard was doing with them chemicals. - Doc's alive? I thought she was dead. I thought they'd killed her. If I'd known she was still alive, I would have joined her. (sighs) Okay, first we need to get you the antidote for the drug. (suspenseful music) Ah the bimbos! - [Trianna] Get away! - Now don't get your panties all bunched up. I'm John Apollo. Doc sent a radio transmission that you all would be coming here. So I thought I'd meet ya little bit halfway in. - Yeah? Prove it! - Well what do want, sperm sample? Look, I know some great shortcuts in Thatch's building so you guys are gonna have to trust me or fight you way through this hell hole yourself. - I'll give you one chance. You mess up, I'll run this spear through your ass. - Yeah, almost sounds like fun. Let's go. - [Trianna] Alright guys, let's go. (footsteps) - Hurry. - Got it! - Come on, come on, let's go, let's go! - The bimbos have escaped. Damn! Thatch'll be furious! - Oh my god! Where do we go? - Great, dead end. - No! (yelling) (yelling) (grunting) (screaming) - Let's lock him up! Let's lock him up, come on! (yelling) Come on, let's get the rest of these guys. In there. - Are you okay Sapphire? - We kicked some ass! - Yeah! - Good job! - You'll be alright, you'll be alright. - How'd you guys manage to pull this one off? - Well, I'm known as the man of a million miracles around here. - Hey! We gotta find Janna! Thatch took her! - Thatch's quarters are on the seventh floor, and heavily guarded. Before we go up there though, we need to stop at my office and get the antidote for the talnid bite. - Where's your office? - It's right over here. - Go, go. - It's here somewhere. Alright. Let's go. - Tasty, just the way I like it. (screaming) Why Janna, say hello to your friends. (laughing) - You bastard! (energetic electronic music) (screaming) Die bastard, die! - Where's Thatch? He's dead? - They killed him. - [Both] Yes! - [Larry] You're next! - No! - You don't understand! Wait a sec! - We're glad! We're at warriors reigning with power! - We got families. - Drop your weapons! - Here have it, have it, give em the knife. Come on here, take the knife. - This isn't some kind of scam! - There's no scam here, I'm gonna tell you something. He and I both have families, he doesn't. But we have families. He said he would feed our babies to the talnids if we didn't do what he wanted. - [Morbius] But now that you've killed him, we have no loyalty to the son of a bitch! - We had no choice! It's either that, or lose everything we had. - What do we do? - Thatch paid him to come up with the machines. - Now that he's gone, I have no loyalty. - Hey, you trust Dr West, he's the one who created the damn talnid! - Well I... Had help in that. - If you want to save your leader, follow me now. If not, let her die. - Then why are we talking, let's go! - Let's go! - [Larry] Let's get our weapons! - You bastard! - There's not much time left. (footsteps) I hope they make it. (gasping) Thank you for bringing this! Oh you guys have come through, I can't believe! We're gonna save her life! Oh my god you guys are wonderful! Thanks John! Thanks John for coming through for me. - What can I say? I'm the original Wonder Man. (laughs) - [Trianna] This'll make you better. We better go. Let's go, come on. - John, I'm sorry we had to hurt you man. (talking) - Stop! - Whoa, listen. Who's that? Who's she? - Trianna? - [Pringle] Who's that? - You've done very well on this mission. You saved Rachelle's life. She's grown very tired and she can't fight anymore. Rachelle wants me to present you with this sword. She wants you to be the queen. All those in favor of Trianna being queen, let it be known! (cheering) (talking) - [Trianna] Do you want me to use this? - Nah that's alright. I don't need my hair cut. - Well you guys are on our team, but! There are some major rules. One. We are not called "bimbos". - [Pringle] Tell him! - I must apologize. - Who called em bimbos? Did we call em bimbos? We ain't called em nothing! - Number two! You will not hit women. - I never did, he hit women. - That would be me again. - Bonehead! (bickering) - [Morbius] I can do that well. - [Man] Speech. - We are one. Together we have fought hard. You were there for me as I was there for you. I will be your queen. All I ask is that you return for a sequel. (dramatic music) (laughing) - I can't believe, we finally got John a part of something where there's no bad assholes. - Sorry about that cut. - Doc you're still an asshole, but I love ya. (laughing) (energetic electronic music) (singing)
