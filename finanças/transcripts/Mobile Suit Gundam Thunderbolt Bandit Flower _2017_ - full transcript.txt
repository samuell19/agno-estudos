Human life is a miracle. What about other animals? Would a bird give up its wings to dive in the ocean? Would a turtle give up its shell to fly into the skies? Would a peacock give up its patterns for stripes? Things like that don't happen. But humans are different. They can continue to innovate. I am lucky. I will not die! You're just a fast crab! That's eight. Is it burning? A Baoa Qu... Ensign Billy! Enemies keep landing. And the Flanagan Agency... Everyone's still there. It's A Baoa Qu! Lt. Creed, Special Service MS eliminated. Can't confirm other enemies. The loading entrance is ahead. Please give orders to continue. Are we only getting reports by wire communications? Forget code verification. Shoot! Yes, sir. - Open all hatches. - Roger. Go! How can they not even grasp the situation until the fighting ends? - The Federation special forces are... - ...excellent, right? Yes, Captain Monica. I don't care about taking out the Zabi dictator. There is something else we must take. Daryl, you okay? The control stick is different. Don't overdo it! Io! Cornelius, do you have any tissues? We've successfully secured our target. The Federation has the psycommu. Altitude 1,600. Tracing the Princes Highway. So this is Sydney... I've only seen it on TV. It's like the Blue Mountains. Even this wasn't enough to thwart the Federation. Even after all this? - The war of independence is still on. - But Zeon became a republic after it lost. Enemy planes! Federation transport planes. Did they see us? Zeon patrol plane sighted above! Signal flares confirmed! All machines, prepare to intercept! Ready core fighters! - Zeon remnant forces? - Damn rebels won't obey the ceasefire! Deploy core fighters! This is Lt. Barclay. Your pleasant flight's over. Show me what you learned in training! It's so hot. It's humid, too. And it's bright. The colonies were more comfortable. The ocean, snow, desert, and grass are all real. Earth really is beautiful. Daryl, make sure you wash your feet! Seawater will make things rust! To the former Living Dead Division, you're a savior. This emblem shows that we, the maintenance team, vow to be of use to you. Please accept it. Thank you. This too, sir. I'll cherish it. That's Ensign Daryl Lorenz. A survivor of the Thunderbolt Sector. I know. He got prosthetics so he could pilot the Psycho Zaku. No one can match his level of self-sacrifice and patriotism. He's a true ace pilot. I admire him. Ensign Billy, easy on the cigarettes. They're unhealthy. Look how big Earth is. It won't matter if I pollute it a bit, Sebastian. Don't step on the coral. Hey, is it hard to do maintenance in gravity? Bianca C-Ca... Bianca Carlyle. Carlyle. I guess. When there's gravity, it's hard to move. - Like going up and down ladders. - You're the Guncannon Aqua's... You're a Thunderbolt Sector survivor, right? I wanted to see the famous Gundam. I see. Around that time, I was fighting at Confeito. - Were you in a GM then? - RGM-79. In Operation Star One, too. - Io was using that at first, too. - Io? The Gundam pilot? Yes. I wish he was here for this operation. Don't worry. I'm here. Although it's my first time on Earth. - That's reassuring. I'm counting on you. - Got it. Begin thrust reverse! All hands, brace for reverse-acceleration defense! - Attitude control is good! - Switch to cruising flight mode! Ouch! I hit my elbow... - We're mid-operation! - But we can move already. - That's not the issue. - It'll be fine. Listen to me! It's the ocean! Order a sortie already! Whatever the enemy is, I'll crush them! - Starting planned orbital path. - Comms with mothership will be cut in 30 seconds. We wish you luck, Petty Officers Julio and Gregory. Execute the kamikaze attack, proud elite soldiers of Zeon. The last smoke tastes so good. - Here comes the anti-air fire! - All right! It's our victory! Anti-air defense! Shoot them with SAMs! - They're descending! We can't lock on! - Just shoot at random! - Making evasive maneuvers! - Just do it! Damn it! Death to whoever came up with this tactic! Death to both the Federation and Zeon! What's that? What attacked us? A Gundam! That's the new model? RX-78AL. That will definitely be the key to this operation. Don't you think so? Huh, he has good taste. Jazz... This is Ensign Io Fleming and the Atlas Gundam arriving. The enemy's target is either Asia or Africa. Those Federation swine. You'll share our pain. Bianca, you're jealous of the new Gundam, huh? Not really. There are fakes with just the head, so their value's gone down. My Guncannon Aqua is more useful in combat. But the new model has new joints. They're like ones on Zeon amphibious suits, no? Oh, kind of. - That's him with that jazz, right? - Yeah. Ensign Io Fleming, thank you for protecting the Spartan. Honored to, Cpt. Monica Humphrey, Joint Chiefs' 3rd bureau deputy director. It's due to the Atlas's performance. The Moore Brotherhood invested a lot into its development. Use it well. - Say something! - It's fine. - I'll have a briefing on the next mission. - Yes, ma'am! A Moore Brotherhood funded Gundam. - I can't stand his elite face. - He's a showoff. We'll let that idiot fight out front. Not a bad plan, right? Io! Yo, partner! I heard your jazz. Would you take a look at this? It came apart during the battle. You're still using the same one? - Any other wouldn't feel right. - I'll examine the cockpit later. Can you check the seat, too? My back gets hot around here. Really? I'll look into it. Also, the railgun got worn out so I tossed it. - You just threw it away! - It wore out after a shot. He thinks he's a hero. But he's a coward who used kids as shields in the Thunderbolt Sector. Don't worry. He'll face judgment one day. - So I had to save you... - Okay, okay. I get it. I'm serious. Eight months after the One Year War, Zeon remnant forces continue their schemes. It is the Federation Forces' duty to resolve this postwar turmoil. However, the South Seas Alliance, a faction in our Federation... is plotting its independence and building its forces. The South Seas Alliance fought alongside us. They've obtained something that's a great threat to us. I'd say Ensign Io is the only one here who knows this machine. It destroyed the Moore Brotherhood's Beehive, three Salamis cruisers... even a Full Armor Gundam. It's a Zeon's experimental machine. It's now in the hands of a cult called the South Seas Alliance. A mobile suit with maximized speed by connecting to the nerves of the pilot's limbs. To utilize this machine, the Zeon forces used disabled vets. The cult's followers would sever their limbs for their beliefs. Before that happens, in order to seize or destroy that machine... we brought in the Atlas Gundam. When we recover the Psycho Zaku, will they cut off everyone's limbs? Who knows? Maybe they'll ask disabled vets to cooperate. What about Newtype research? There must be others with potential besides me. Of course, but to me, your powers are... Fall in. The current's too erratic. Roger. The woman who invented his Reuse Psycho Device lost her mind, right? "Groovy Duel" is hip. You were listening to it when you landed. - You know that tune? - Of course! It's my favorite. I can play it without a score. And no mistakes. Same here. I'm Io Fleming. I know. He was six months old. We were finally able to have a kid. I should've let them evacuate to the homeland sooner. My wife and I... We dug him out from the rubble. That little baby! Spartan! Advance to the region controlled by the South Seas Alliance. Captain, your seatbelt. Oh, of course. I can do it. - It's different than on the Salamis. - Really? Oh, it's true. Oh, how pretty. Looks kinda kinky... We're bonding as a team! I know. That's why I came, too. Wow... There's not much space left. My left buttock is open. You've been around. I've been getting these since my first deployment. Operations Cembalo and Star One are the newest. Proof of your service? I remember my comrades with these tattoos. Since I'm forgetful. Captain Vincent to Captain Marie. Patrol mission. Prepare landing craft 1 through 4. This is Captain Marie. Mobile suits have been loaded. We'll prepare to launch. Adding computers to jazz mixed the dying essence of free jazz and fusion, and revived it. Vijay Iyer and Bomba Kesorike took out what was unnecessary in jazz. Like with sex and violence. - Love will follow. - That's Universal Century jazz. No, that's the elegance of jazz that's lasted since its inception. Ferocity, precision, and elegance. Oh yeah. What do you suggest for our next session? Let's see... Let's play "Groovy Duel" with no mistakes. If we survive. "Groovy Duel". Got it. Lt. Barclay to bridge. This is our first mission with the Spartan. We're all yours. You'll be searching for enemies. Good luck. Lot of our rookies want to pilot mobile suits. It's the perfect mission. We've lost a lot of fighter pilots. Yes, I know. As long as the Federation exists, my vengeance will have no end. The Minovsky particles are so dense. What's going on? Wait a sec. - Amphibious mobile suit below! - And the Ball? I'm sorry, Bianca. I missed it. Carolina! Cut the communication cable! Have the Balls retreat! Oh no! The water! Retreat to the surface! Can't they ascend? Don't get full of yourselves, Zeon remnants! I'll sink your mothership first! A makeshift amphibious machine is no match for this Gogg! You'll regret this! You're mine at this range! Nice. Port blocks 17 and 18 are flooded! Seal all bulkheads to flooded blocks! Retreat to deeper waters! I'm right behind you! Why you... One got away! The Gogg isn't just subaqueous. Have you ever danced on ice? To Fleming. Atlas Gundam, taking off! Focus energy on leg jets and sabers. The thoughtless serve the Federation. I won't pity you, though you're a woman. I don't need you to treat me like a woman! What? My power! No time to recharge! Retrieve damaged mobile suits. Status on the ice! I don't know. We can't link. How long has it been since the commander ascended? Hey! Your band member's here, Ensign Bianca. Bastard. I'm right here. Scatter! Spread out! What? Projectiles? Drag him down! That's nothing. They aren't breaking! The Federation isn't the only one with luna titanium! As long as you're chained, you won't get away! The generator! What's going on? What is this? The Arrows of Medusa. Damn it! Burst. Last one! An amphibious Gundam. That's what the Atlas is. Gotcha. I'll go up and fire. What was that attack? to! Escape these waters once we've rescued Commander Kaufmann. I'll handle him. Roger! Lt. Bull, good luck. Come on. First underwater battle? Damn lobster, clawing my new ride! Take my right arm! - Seriously? - Fire! He read my timing? These legs aren't for show! My Grublo! Oh no, I'm falling! How many meters is the Atlas's pressure limit? I have energy. There's gotta be a way! Here it is! I'll give energy to the sabers. I should be able to ascend! All right, I should be fine with the Gundam's output. The temperature? Why are you stopping? I'm sinking. Recharge? You're all busted up. You even lost all your new equipment. What a spendthrift. Bianca. We saved each other, so now we're even. Io, I'll treat you when we get back. What do you want? Macallan, 12 year, straight... ...partner. I have souvenirs for both of us. That's great, Karla. Natural honey is rare. Let's savor it. It's great with toast, Papa. You're right, Karla. Let's come again. Promise? Yeah. I promise. Welcome back, Karla. Did you have fun? Yes. I got a souvenir. It's honey. How wonderful. - But bees sting people, right? - Yes, you should be careful. - I will. - Karla, your papa has work, so say bye. See you, Papa. Good luck with work. See you, Karla. Bye-bye! Bye now. She's a nice girl. Especially when her papa's around. I see. See you! Thank you, Ensign Daryl. We appreciate your help in her recovery. The Reuse Psycho Device- It's fine. I understand. Take care of Professor Karla. Yes, thank you. Due to trauma, her mind and memory have regressed to early adolescence. She has almost no memory of being a doctor. However, the security of a paternal presence is stabilizing her mind a bit. Are you saying mental stability will lead to memory recovery? Exactly. Ensign Daryl is essential for her treatment. I hope you can limit his combat activities. - I guess this is an important duty, too. - "Too"? That's right. This as well as his other duties. Hey, you're back. You chat about the old days? Nothing has changed. That might be for the better. Not having to suffer from the monster you yourself created. Huh? The ensign's here. He had to see his woman. Why are we going as planned when you haven't fixed this yet? - I object! - It's not my decision! - I'm on standby? - I'm complaining! We're not used to this. The railgun's buggy, too. - It broke after a few shots! - Hey, mine's fine, right? It has more parts to change. The reactor's a mess, too. What? You kicked with the right leg, didn't you? - Did you? - I might have... That wasn't good. But I had a huge fatso on me! He- - Have the mechanics focus on mine! - Hey! You broke yours, too. The Atlas is the key to the next mission, right? Ow! Trashing the new model like that? You've got some nerve! The same goes for you! Sorry. Hey there. The hero and heroine are grounded. - Leave the next mission to us. - The amphibi... The amphi... amphibi... You can't even pronounce it. Bye-bye. - I'm begging you, partner. - I can't. For the undersea infiltration, the South Seas Alliance won't use Minovsky particles. - Since the Acguy has radar, Ensign Daryl- - Hold on. It'd be over if they do disperse them. They won't. Even if they did use the particles... Ensign Daryl's machine can share data and communicate within a radius of 600 meters. And that'll be fine for this mission? Enough of this! If they do disperse particles, we just have to act accordingly, right? We're going into the enemy's core, after all. Even so, the crux, Ensign Daryl's machine, has far fewer weapons than normal Acguys. Try to avoid combat. The priority is to rescue the spy and retrieve his data. - I'll shoot. That's what the gear's for. - Combat is not our objective. Roger. What can you do? It's broken. We didn't get to play "Groovy Duel". Save it for when the mission succeeds. Succeeds? We haven't even been deployed. Hey. Get your safety bars on. Or I'm the one who'll get in trouble. Map update complete. Sending data to all units. Checking reception level. Lower your weapons. Just restrain them. - Wasn't there another kid? - She's running. Get her! - What were you doing? - I knew it! Get her. Roger. I'll get her! Don't move. Just stay still. Not the heat hawk! Crap! Damn. Hey, turn off the heat hawk! The kid ran off again. Change of plans! Not yet. It's only a kid. Just catch her. Fisher! From the south, 3 cars and 4 bikes! See? No shame in changing plans. Seb! What the heck? They're fighting? I have to get all the way there? Can I actually get home? - Incoming. - Billy! Fisher! Mobile suits! - I saw them. - Where? We can't contact the spy at this rate! We'll do the rescuing. Fisher, join the battle! Plan B! Go to plan B! It's like the Newtype said. How creepy. - They're carrying Zeon mobile suits? - The South Seas Alliance are Federation forces! They salvage damaged ones. They said so at the briefing. Better than shooting at your own kind. Damn, this is not good. The map... Commander Peer of the South Seas Alliance's border garrison to the Earth Federation warship. You are violating our airspace. This is a clear violation of our autonomy. Report your ship's name, affiliation, and reason for entry. If not, you must leave our airspace. I repeat. Commander Peer of the South Seas Alliance's border garrison to the Earth Federation warship. This voice... - You are violating our airspace. - Is this for real? Hey. Hold on. What's wrong? This is... Commander Peer of the South Seas Alliance's border garrison to the Earth Federation warship. Report your ship's name, affiliation, and reason for entry. If not, you must leave our airspace! You... Why? What are you doing? Of all places... Claudia! I won't die here... Hey! Who is that woman? It's Claudia. We thought she was dead. Dead? We are carrying out a mission to wipe out the Zeon remnant forces. Clear the way and follow our orders. - What's your mission? - It's confidential. Just shut up and make way! Such a vile way of speaking. They fired? Are they crazy? - That was a projectile, sir. - Log that as a hostile act. Disperse Minovsky particles! Is this really an official operation of the Federation Forces? She's well-informed. The South Seas Alliance will fight any infringement of our autonomy. Chow Ming, hit them this time. Roger. Please witness the fruits of my training, Reverend. Retreat to point D! What are you doing? Hurry! Roger that. Shoot, I can't pick up the signal. Get in the Corvette Booster! Fly me around! Don't blame me if we get shot down! Catching her alive would be a miracle! The captain's authorized a sortie! Io, please stop Claudia! I won't let her die here. Everything up to now has been within expectations. Optical lenses and heat sensors down! Enemy lost due to chaff! - Captain Marie, we have no visual. - Don't shoot. I can't transmit! Watch out for Dodais in the area. Where's Sonia and Lt. Creed? I guess the enemy can't come near us in this fog. Spartan bridge, this is core fighter, Barclay. We can't distinguish ally from enemy. Spartan bridge! Contacting the spy here is impossible! - Let's regroup! Supplies are low! - Give the order! - Captain, we're out of spare magazines! - Captain! Orders! - All units! Retreat to the Party Table! - Party Table, roger that! I'll take the rear here! Fisher, shoot here. That'll save us! - Trust the Newtype! - Again? Enough! I'll never do a mission like this again! Sorry about that. - Enemy MS destroyed at close range! - Port mega particle cannon wrecked! That's fine. Keep firing! We didn't shoot it down. It charged at us as a sacrifice to make way for allies. - It self-destructed? - This is the power of faith. They're coming! Have they been brainwashed? Shoot them down! Look at those flight units. They can't fly freely! It's latched on! Thank you, Reverend Chow Ming. We'll take it from here. For the land of truth envisioned by High Priest Levan Fuu. You damn monks! Damn it! Hey, monks! We don't permit religious solicitation! Ascending is the one thing I can't do. Marcus, Orphe, you all right? Hey, Io's in there? I have business with the Dodai they were on. I'll leave the rest to you. Don't go off on your own! Close the hatch. We're done with our mobile suits. - On to hand-to-hand combat. - Hand-to-hand? Us too? You can stay in the cockpit, but be sure you have your weapon ready. Yes, sir! - No more mid-to-long-range weapons! - Same here! We can't go on! We need to go to the withdrawal point! Daryl... With this, I'll know. Were Ensign Daryl's achievements thanks to the Psycho Zaku? Or can he excel in the Acguy, too? Perhaps it was a rumor to raise morale. I'm far from the real thing. If there is a true Newtype, I'd like to see it. It's a small number of intruders. And they're not trained well. - Perhaps their goal isn't to take over. - Then what is it? I don't know. Should we relocate? In these circumstances, this is the safest place. Not hers. Io, do you plan on kicking down all the enemy Dodais? Those kind of acrobatics in gravity is insane, even for you! I've got no choice! I don't know which one Claudia's in! Why bother getting your ex? I want to know what happened to her. Maybe she's a pathetic princess who's been brainwashed by monks. Yeah... Hmph. Suicide attack! Central block F21 damaged to outer wall! What is it they're after? Making contact with an informant? Or bringing something aboard? I'm counting on you. - This is the riverside. We can go straight. - The enemy stopped attacking. Something's going on. The bridge! It's broken! Shake him off! Not this one either! - We're going to crash! - Please, just stay quiet! Come on. Show me, Ensign Daryl. I can do this! Frizzy yard? All right! That was amazing! Wait. Are you Ensign Daryl? Right, I haven't even introduced myself. He didn't go down with them? Well done, Ensign Daryl! Destroying a mobile suit without decent weapons. - You were watching? - We've come to help. - Are you dissatisfied with that? - I'll cover the rear. Thank you, Ensign Billy Hickam. - Number 5 is down! - Damn it! It's free-falling? Io, put away your beam saber! - What took so long, footstool? - Want to swim, you selfish prick? - This is for our comrades! - Die! Claudia! Say my name! Io... Reverend, I'm coming! Buzz off. Chow Ming, don't! Get your hands off the reverend! Io! Reverend! Io... He did all this? With a GM Type-C and a Corvette Booster? The Atlas pilot sure is something. - We'll have to buy him a drink. - For this kid? - He saved us. - Still hate him. Spartan bridge, Bianca Carlyle reporting. Ensign Io injured in battle. Could be an electric shock. Get the medics. No damage to machine exterior. Io, are you all right? Cornelius, got any tissues? I'm dirty. - What about Claudia? - Before that, I need to talk to the hag. I knew that Claudia was with the South Seas Alliance. Since she joined, the alliance's operational command has improved. If I had a chance to break her, of course I would want to use you. - I wanna punch you. - So you brought me in? Yes, not just for the Flemings' money. Enough about that woman. "I shall return from death and fulfill the path of righteousness." Along with this talisman, this was in your room. This is an incense container. I give them as farewell gifts to children who leave my facility. What facility? A Newtype laboratory. Here. J.J. Sexton, formerly of the Zeon Science Academy. You know him, right? - He's in the South Seas Alliance? - They didn't just get the Psycho Zaku. Due to long research since his childhood, he sustained severe damage to his brain. And so he started a religion. After leaving my lab... he started using a telepathic ability that was enhanced while he was there. That's how he controls his followers. I... I can hear the high priest's voice. I raised him. And I abandoned him. He's my former student. Levan Fuu is a Newtype.
