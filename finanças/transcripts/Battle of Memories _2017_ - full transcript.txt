Xiaoyun, are your parents fighting again? No. I could hear them shouting. Why don't I talk to them? Aunt Zhang, everything's fine. Xiaoyun... Hello, is this the police? Nation T Mr. Jiang, have you marked all the memories you wish to delete? Yes. Have a seat. Relax, we will now begin removing your memories. Midnight Rain Mr. Jiang, did you experience any discomfort, anger, or any other noticeable sensation? I can't remember. I can't remember. Congratulations, your memories were successfully removed. Mr. Jiang, we need a blood sample for DNA matching. This acts as the password for retrieving your memories. Why do I feel like I can still recall so much of my memories? Many people have misconceptions. It isn't simply about the removal of memories. It's that in these memories, your perspective changes from participant to spectator, thus severing the emotional ties. This key is yours. If you'd like to restore your memories, please bring this. Are there this many people everyday? We have 17 Master of Memory Centers worldwide. This is the only one in Asia. So every extracted memory in Asia is stored right here. You can imagine just how many people's memories are here. Mr. Jiang, have you been working on a new novel? Ah, yes. I've read all your works. My favorite is "Silent Bird". Now that it's become a TV series everybody in the office is watching it. You're good to go. Rest assured, our customer service is handled one-on-one and we have strict confidentiality rules. So, the contents of my memories are absolutely secure? Of course. There's no machine in the world that can read the contents of your memory chip. My apologies. -Not at all. -Please follow me. What's wrong with you? Call security. Go restore your memories. -Give me her memories. -Calm down. Give me. Don't worry. Get away from me! Restore her memories. Now! What are you doing, put the gun down! Get your memories back. Get them back. You already had your chance. Please. It's too late. This was already my second procedure. Those memories are gone forever. That's alright, you can have mine. I signed the divorce agreement, I made no changes. Sign it. If you want to review the division of assets feel free to read it again. As for this apartment, I'm planning on selling it. We split 50/50. I already have an agent working on it. What? Wasn't divorce your idea? Can you wait a moment? There's something I want to tell you. Go ahead. I want to speak to my husband. Technically, I still am. You're not acting like my husband at all. Let me ask you, do you remember where you proposed to me? And where we went for our honeymoon? I proposed to you on the rooftop. I proposed to you on the rooftop. We were poor then and couldn't afford a honeymoon. I can remember these clearly. What the surgery removed are specific details and emotions. In any case, if you don't get your memories back, I'm not signing this. Mr. Jiang, we will begin restoring your memories. Excuse me, I've kept you two waiting. Mr. Jiang, I'm prescribing you sleeping pills. This will help you enter deep sleep. Normally, it will take 2 or 3 sleep cycles to re-activate your memories, that is, to restore them. But I must warn you. Using this method to restore your memories, once 72 hours have passed, those memories will be permanent. Do you mean to say, Do you mean to say, if I want to remove these memories again, I'd need another operation within 72 hours? To be specific, the 72 hours begins once your memory starts to restore itself. Also, the next operation wouldn't be an extraction, it would be a permanent deletion. With current technology, it's impossible to store the memories a second time. During this time, Mr. Jiang, you can think everything through. If you'd like to proceed with the surgery please let us know in advance. -Then I'll -Feng, Can you wait for your memories to come back before making a decision? I was about to order delivery. I brought food for you, medicine, books, and some clean clothes. Thanks. I saw her. I saw her. She's fine, don't worry. Hello? Huilan I just wanted him to know I'm OK. If you do this, then what's the point of hiding? You're right. Thank you for all your help. But there are some things that But there are some things that I have to clear up with him in person. OK, I'll come with you. Don't. I can handle this myself. You've really mixed my memories up. Mr. Jiang, we've all signed confidentiality agreements. We don't know the contents of your memories. Which is to say, we are responsible for safekeeping your memory chip, but not for its contents. Well, memories must at least be sequential, right? They can't just be random fragments with no context. Didn't I say it takes 3 days to fully restore your memories? Maybe in a few days, you'll have the context to make sense of it. Mr. Jiang, how about I... If it's our problem, we will take responsibility. If it's our problem, we will take responsibility. But all your suspicions now have no basis. It's pure speculation. I've done my research. This surgery hasn't been approved in several countries. That must mean there are problems with it. Mr. Jiang, are you familiar with plastic surgery and its history of development? I'll tell you. Many soldiers returned from World War I with facial injuries. Many soldiers returned from World War I with facial injuries. Plastic surgery at the time was not simply about facial reconstruction, it was about rebuilding self-confidence to help return people to their normal lives. Nowadays, plastic surgery has transitioned from fixing problems to enhancing beauty features. Everybody can become more beautiful. Why are you telling me this? Allow me to finish. But if the purpose of the surgery is now beauty, it opens another possibility: helping criminals to hide their identities and escape the law. Do you believe this is fair? Do you believe this is fair? Our surgery is no different from plastic surgery. One is for physical defects. The other is for emotional trauma. The original motivations of these surgeries are good. But the key lies in the user's intentions. What are you saying? What I'm saying is, how would I know whether you've stored sentimental memories or memories of murder? What did you say? Please leave. Help! Police! I got injured falling off my bike. It's obviously from Dad hitting you. -Don't talk nonsense. -Please lie down. It will only get worse. These are the medical records you wrote for Li Huilan. Can you confirm? I don't need to see it. Last year, June 9th. Two rib fractures, Two rib fractures, left arm radial fracture, multiple soft tissue contusions. Yes, sign here. You remember it so clearly. Shanshan, I must apologize for asking you to come in. No problem. Officer Shen, if that's all, I'll be on my way. I'm meeting my agent to see apartments. OK, we're finished here. Oh, Officer Shen. Oh, Officer Shen. Could you get me a visitor's pass? I want to see her husband's sentencing. I'll see what I can do. Thanks. Walk her out. Come on, walk her out. Shanshan, so you're buying an apartment? My agent scheduled some viewings. I actually know of a few good places. Really? OK. What is it? What is it? Did you find something? Officer, has the killer been found yet? None of your business. Sit back down. But Officer, I know some information. What do you know? Tell me. Well...did this woman run away from home for awhile before she died? Please see yourself out. Don't mind me. She was staying with the killer. You witnessed this? Do you know what you're talking about? Officer, here's what happened. I recently went to the Master of Memory Center to do a memory surgery. But once I retrieved my memories back, I can now clearly see this woman's murder. So bigshot author, you must know who the killer is then. I don't know if you'll understand what I'm saying. if you'll understand what I'm saying. In the memories, I'm the killer. There's a greenhouse, I can't tell where it is. Her face has scars, but she's not at all scared of the killer. They seem pretty close. Can you think of any specific details about the killer? Can you think of any specific details about the killer? I only just restored these memories. It might need some time. So, you really don't know anything. What do you expect us to do? How can you say that? I can see the killer drown Li Huilan in the bathtub. You saw that. I did. Are you sure? I saw it with my own eyes. With your own eyes. In my memories. OK bigshot author, please stop wasting our time. If you need inspiration, go watch the news. I'm telling the truth! Take a break. Wait for your family to come post bail. Why won't you believe me? It's a big greenhouse, should be easy to spot. OK. Also there's a number of wood carvings inside. One is unfinished. You can investigate Huilan's close friends. Mr. Jiang, you really are an excellent storyteller. Hello, is this the police? I'm at Seawall Village, Twenty... Mom, what are you doing? Mom, what are you doing? No police. It'll be too embarassing if this gets out. Honey! -Open the door! -Go away, my sister doesn't want to see you. Honey, I was wrong. Come back home. Honey, I'm holding a knife, if you don't come out, I'll chop my own finger off. Honey! Honey, -Sister, don't go. -1 -Sister, don't go. -1 Sister, Sister, Are you sure? Mom, I know I've been bad. I will change. Mom. Let's go home, Why aren't you coming? Behave yourself. Let's go. Please slow down. Please slow down. I'm begging you. I was wrong, I'm sorry. Let him off the car. At least let him off the car. Car! Car! -Will you listen to me? -I will, I will. Yes, yes, whatever you say. You treated me like garbage. You left me no choice. No choice! No choice! Today, in front of your family, in front him, I was kneeling on the ground and you wouldn't even look at me. Are you happy now? Happy? Answer me, do you dare to leave me again? Do you dare? Speak! Whose file do you want? Li Huilan. Sir, you don't really believe Jiang Feng? Huilan wasn't even drowned to death. Huilan wasn't even drowned to death. Don't forget, he even assaulted the director of that center. Maybe that surgery really did mess him up. Do you consider Jiang a well-known author? Yes. Alright. Then why would a well-known author come to the police and spread lies? Publicity, to create some buzz. Everybody famous does that now. If not entertainment headlines, they'll try for the front page. He must be releasing a new book. When's the new book coming out? I don't know. I don't know. -I'm looking for Officer Shen -I didn't Sir, excuse me. Please wait outside a moment. -Just a minute. -Officer Shen Officer Shen, Mr. Jiang wants to see you. I know. Give him some. I know. According to you, this person not only killed Li Huilan, he also killed another woman. So he's a serial killer. Yes. But you said earlier that Huilan was drowned to death. Now you're saying there were two murders. Still working on the story's ending? I'm telling the truth. What's the phone number? You should have seen Huilan's home phone number. What is it? You can't remember any of it? Let me think. Is that the ending? I can't be sure. What day did you have the surgery? Friday, it was the day of the shooting. How about this, I I'll go home and think it over. Once things are clearer, I'll let you know. Lei, detain him. I came to provide leads for you. Do you believe what I'm saying or not? -Of course not. -I believe you. That's why I suspect you have a connection with this case. That's why I suspect you have a connection with this case. Try to understand. Sir, he's clearly talking nonsense. Why are we keeping him? Look at Li Huilan's home phone number. Read it out loud. 0909914 Sir, it's just a coincidence I'll be damned, somebody's here. Bro, what brought you here? First time here? First time? Then I should educate you a bit. What if somebody bullies you next time around? What if somebody bullies you next time around? Right? Do you know what that's for? Those handcuffs are for drug addicts. Once they're here, those kids will do anything to hurt themselves. All sorts of crazy ideas. Smashing themselves against the bars, swallowing rings. One time I met a woman in South City, it was unbelievable. She hid some needles in her hair and swallowed them. Scared the hell out of the police. This crappy place has all kinds of people. Robbers, prostitutes, Robbers, prostitutes, clients of prostitues, brawlers, arsonists, thieves, etc. Bro, you still haven't told me why you're here. Assault. Assault? Must be you got assaulted. You're not the type, I have a good sense. You don't have that look in your eye. What look? Have you ever looked into the eyes of a killer? Ignoring me? I don't feel like talking to you either, it's too one-sided. Stop. Zoom in. That's Jiang Feng. Who's that? Who's that? Zoom in. He's picking something up. It looks that way. I'll pay the Master of Memory Center a visit. Call me if there's anything. Print this. What are you doing? I was worried after your call, so I came over. I'm fine, you should go. I'm fine, you should go. Even like this, you still say you're fine? I said I'm fine. Just leave me be. Go. I can't let you go on like this. Let's go. Go where? Quick, get out. My husband will be back anytime. It's none of your business. Just go. Hurry. Go! Open the door! Open the door! Bitch, open the door! Why did you lock the door? For security. Who was here? Stop hitting me. Stop hitting me. Where? I didn't mean it. Is he still alive? I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. He's not dead. Leave him. Come with me. I can't leave. If I go, what about my daughter? No police. Last time I left home, he was questioned by his supervisor. he was questioned by his supervisor. If I disappear again, he'll lose his job. I'm fine. It's already been 10 years, nothing's going to happen. It's been 10 years and he hasn't changed. What can you expect from him? Don't be like this. Don't be like this. It's weird. He's scum, he'll never cherish you. Stop saying these things. Don't you feel it's strange for you to talk like this? You're scaring me. Sorry, please leave. Leave him. Come with me. Leave him. OK? Stop dreaming. I'll never loved you. You make me sick. You scared me. You're crying. Nightmare? What was it? Tell me. Step away from him. Move aside. Just caring for him. Over to the wall. Officer Lei, I saw some more things. I saw the killer push Li Huilan down the stairs. The strange thing was that afterwards, it seemed like she couldn't see clearly. OK. I'll pass this along. I'll pass this along. Do you guys still not believe me? I have a question. Is this you? Picking something up? That day, I dropped my memory chip's key. Do you remember this person? OK Why? From the camera footage, you both were retrieving things at the same time. Officer, Officer, I'm hungry, is there afternoon tea? I'm hungry, is there afternoon tea? Want to stick around for a midnight snack? Officer Lei, send somebody to protect my wife. Why? If the killer now has my memories, my wife is in grave danger. Just think, the other two victims were both very close with the killer. Give me a minute. Officer Lei Sir Officer Lei! Officer Lei! Sir, how come you're not back? I'm still at the Master of Memory. Any new developments? Jiang Feng thought of some more things. It really does seem relevant to the case. He said Huilan couldn't see clearly. Remember the autopsy report mentioned that Huilan had severe myopia. This is a crucial detail. Come out now, let's meet at Huilan's house. OK. Bro, you asked him to protect your wife. Why not just ask him to let us out of here? Sir, any relevant evidence has already been collected. Why are we here? Then tell me, what evidence is relevant? Even the most ordinary items at the scene could have served a specific purpose during the incident. could have served a specific purpose during the incident. How many times have I said, don't label things relevant or not so lightly. Understood. You understand what? What are we here for? I don't know. Go look upstairs. Sir, look, I found something. Sir, Sir, look. Get out of my way. Is everything alright? Lei Sir Officers, how many times do I need to be questioned? I do have a life. Ms. Zhang, I apologize. When we re-examined the testimonies, we found some issues. Can we trouble you for a minute? Can we trouble you for a minute? According to your statement, you knocked on Li Xiaoyun's door at 9:01 PM. Xiaoyun responded that everything was fine. But according to our police records, Xiaoyun called the police at 9:03 PM. That's only a two minute gap. I'm absolutely certain about it. I arrived at her house at 9:01 PM. How can you remember it so precisely? Simple. Every night I watch the TV show, "Silent Bird". That day, I could hear them fighting. That day, I could hear them fighting. The show hadn't ended, so I didn't go immediately. Besides, they fight all the time. This show, they play the next episode's trailer at 8:59. At 9:00, it goes to commercials. As soon as the trailer ended, I went over. You can see their door is just a few steps away. One minute at the most. That hurts. When Huilan left home, do you know where she went? When Huilan left home, do you know where she went? I don't know. But during that time, their daughter went to and from school as usual, like nothing had happened. Then Xiaoyun must have known her mom's whereabouts. I couldn't possibly know that. But during the time her mom was away, There were two times that I saw somebody drive her home. What's strange is that each time the car stopped far away. Xiaoyun walked the rest of the way home. Also, I once overheard Xiaoyun and her dad arguing. I once overheard Xiaoyun and her dad arguing. Li Hang asked Xiaoyun, do you know where Mom is? Guess what she said. What did she say? That little girl said, Why do you care? She'd be better dead than with you. Let me ask you something. I don't know anything, don't bother. That woman you mentioned, why did she swallow needles? What do you think? Medical release. If you harm yourself, the police are afraid of you dying. They'll definitely send you to the hospital. So, what are you hiding? I'm not hiding anything. I can give you money. I want out. Sir, Sir, wake up. What time is it? 7:05 Sir, have you considered getting a new car? There's tape on there for protection. Even if it's swallowed, it won't kill you. You can later vomit or grab it out. As long as they believe you're not faking it, they'll definitely send you to the hospital. Bro, you haven't told me how much you're paying. How much money for you to swallow this? Me? Are you crazy? Stop stop joking around. Police! What are you doing? He swallowed a razor. Move aside, Damn it, he swallowed a razor. Spit it out, spit it out. What are you doing? Open the door! Open it now! Open the door! Daichen Stop him. Feng How come you're out? I'm applying for your bail. Sorry, you can't leave. Don't let them go. Listen to me. These next few days, beware of any strangers. What strangers? What are you talking about? Jiang Feng. Let me go, let go me. Let me go, let go me. Let him go, I already paid his bail. You have the wrong person. -Don't move. -Feng You're under arrest for assaulting a police officer. Why are you arresting him again? I just paid his bail. Move, don't try anything. Who are you? Go. He's my husband. Officer, my husband is normally a very gentle man. I don't know what's gotten into him recently. But believe me, he's not a criminal. You should get that injury looked at. Kim, send her to Dr. Chen. It's just a scratch. We have our procedures, as a family member, please understand. Say, if you had just waited 10 more minutes, your wife could have bailed you out. I believe you. I went to the Master of Memory Center. They're very uncooperative, insisting on a warrant. Here's the thing, applying for a warrant would take 10-15 days. So I can't investigate who you swapped memories with. How's my wife? You tell me. You only have 72 hours, right? On the bright side, maybe the killer hasn't noticed the swap. So we have to stay one step ahead, So we have to stay one step ahead, and uncover his identity. Then go investigate. Your wife was explaining to me how kind and gentle of a person you normally are. Everything you've done today, is that really you? Your memories are our only hope for breaking this case. I need your full cooperation. Give me more clues so that I can find the killer. Only then can you and your wife be safe. OK, I'll do whatever you say. Does it hurt? I'm fine. Thanks. You're welcome. I'm just helping out Officer Shen. I'm Chen Shanshan. Just call me Shanshan. I'm Daichen. Zhang Daichen. It's on your medical record. This is a very deep wound. Officer Shen told me everything. My husband didn't do it on purpose. He didn't mean it. but you must look after yourself. Jiang Feng, Jiang Feng, don't worry about a thing. Relax. Focus on remembering details. See if you can stay conscious while asleep. How can I do that? Try this. Before you sleep, keep telling yourself, I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. It's that simple. Just relax, get comfortable. Sleep. Who was here? Who? Speak. There really was nobody here. Sorry, I really didn't know who to call, so I called you. so I called you. Who was here? Here, don't be scared. Did Dad do this? Go. It'll only be trouble if you stay. I'll wait for you to go before calling the police. Let her go, let go. Officer Shen Officer Shen Officer Shen Jiang Feng Jiang Feng Jiang Feng Jiang Feng Jiang Feng Jiang Feng I understand now. You said certain things appear blurred, and certain areas you can't enter. That's because you are in a person's memory. If he didn't see something, then you can't either. Places he didn't go, you can't go either. Tell me, what kind of person would carry white gloves? There are lots of possibilities. Then what does the goldfish floating in mid-air represent? Clearly that's a supernatural occurrence. It's your memories getting mixed with your dreams. No. The doctor told me earlier, these are memories being restored, not dreams. Regarding Xiaoyun and the killer, Regarding Xiaoyun and the killer, what's their relationship? They know each other. But Xiaoyun didn't see the murder happen. She believes the killer is there to help her mom. There's one thing I haven't figured out. In the memory, I'm so violent towards Huilan, yet, the moment she died, I experienced a very bizarre emotion. What emotion? I felt happy for her. Right, also, the last call from Huilan's home is to the killer. Dr. Chen I brought you some medicine. This is great for minimizing scars. For you. I can't just accept this. It's OK. It's OK. Sorry, please come in. Take a seat. Would you like a drink? Anything's fine. It's so hot today, and you came all this way to bring me medicine. You really didn't have to. It's nothing, it was on the way. Actually, I wanted to ask you something. So, I have a spare concert ticket and I can't find anybody to come with me. Would you be interested? Of course. But‚ How about this, I'll leave you my card. My number is on there. If you change your plans or if something happens to your wound, call me anytime. OK, thank you. Then, I'll be on my way. -I still need to stop by the hospital. Sir Not so loud. Sorry. Sorry, sorry. Hello Xiaoyun, we have some questions, is now a good time? A police officer is talking to you. Don't be nervous. We just want to confirm some details. We just want to confirm some details. Xiaoyun, where did your mom go during the time she left home? Young lady, don't lie. How could your mom leave without telling you? Also, I heard during that time, somebody was sending you home. Who was that? I was riding in a classmate's car. Classmate. Then, which classmate? What's his name? Bring me to him. Mister, are you asking these questions in an official police capacity? Coming here to find me, does the station know about this? You should be well aware that I'm a minor. Why the attitude? What, you're scaring people. I definitely think she's suspicious. What do you think about her relationship with her mom? I think it's fine. Then why do you think she's covering up for her mom's killer? I know. Xiaoyun probably had enough of her parent's bickering. So she kills her mom and then frames her dad. Lawyer Li Yes, yes, I think it's strange too. Jiang Feng is not at all Yes, there must be a mistake. Oh, really? That's great, that's a relief to hear. Sir, I can't figure this out. Do you think it's more likely that Xiaoyun's covering up for the killer, or that Jiang Feng's brain got messed up? He's coming. Li Hang, we have some more questions about the events that night. Your cooperation is appreciated. I'm talking to you. Look at me. Li Hang, can you tell us the sequence of events that night? can you tell us the sequence of events that night? I got drunk, I hit her, then she died. Can you be more specific? I've said everything that needs to be said. Then say it again. I've already pleaded guilty. So, you're certain it was you who killed Huilan? Otherwise? Do you know about your daughter's friends at school? During that time, did you see somebody drive her back from school? Answer. She makes her own decisions. Did you really kill your wife? Does it matter? She's already dead. Grab me two painkillers. Painkillers Sleeping pills Go. This is every recent female domestic about case. I don't think she's the type to call the police. This is another Li Huilan. They don't feel that their husband's violent behavior is a crime. They don't feel that their husband's violent behavior is a crime. Also, their two personalities are very similar, but the killer's behavior with them is totally different. With one, it's slipping drugs behind her back. The other, it's using a weapon and killing face to face. Based on the crimes, it doesn't seem like the same person. Do you think you have more than one person's memories? Do you think you have more than one person's memories? Or maybe, he has split personality disorder? Any information from Xiaoyun? She said nobody else was there that night. Impossible. She's lying. Why not just bring her over and let me confront her? It's not that easy. She's a minor. To override her testimony, To override her testimony, I need to go through her guardian, her school's legal representative. I'd also have to contact the juvenile protection agency. What is this? Didn't you say you hadn't found Huilan's last phone call? I haven't verified it yet. You've clearly found it, why lie to me? I have to use my own judgment. Whose number is this? Can't you just call and figure that out? Do I report to you? What are you hiding? My wife is in danger out there. What are you doing? Please escort Mr. Jiang back. Mr. Jiang, let's go. Hello, welcome. Hello Daichen, you came. Here's your bag. Thank you. Officer Lei, the hospital called. They didn't find a razor in Gu Haibo's stomach. Got it. Go. Shanshan, could I ask a favor?

After our marriage, I've made fewer new friends. You know, I used to be a writer too. It's a pity I stopped. It would be wonderful if you resumed writing. I will. Anyways, it's never too late to write a book. Officer, I'd like some water. Don't do anything crazy. Don't move. You'll only make the wound larger. I'm giving you a shot of tranquilizer. Don't move.

Cuff your hand with his. OK. Give him the shot of tranquilizer. Do it. Alright. Put the scissors down, OK? Freeze! Freeze! Hello? Daichen Feng What happened to your voice? Hello? You're out? Don't worry about that for now. Where are you? Wanxiang Concert Hall. Who are you with? A friend, what's the matter? Just stay there. Wait for me. Hello? Hello? What is it? Nothing. What's the status now? You're not pursuing Jiang Feng? Why are you here? Sir, Sir, I've found a breakthrough. What breakthrough? I ask you, how do you think the killer and the victims are connected? Lovers. Wrong. Actually, let me phrase it differently. The killer and the victims' husbands, how are they related? Love rivals. Wrong again. OK, let me ask, if one day you're married, you come home, and you discover your wife cheating with somebody, What would you do? Castrate him. What if you couldn't? So, I think there's another possibility regarding the killer and the victims' relationship. Best Friend! Sir, could the killer be a woman? I brought you food, medicine, books, -and some clean clothes. -Thanks. Grab me two painkillers. Who was here? Leave him. You want me to leave my husband? Don't you get it? He's scum. Stop dreaming. I'll never love you. You make me sick. Medical Gloves?? Doctor. Daichen, why don't I wait for him with you? OK. Hello? Hello? Is everything alright? Yes, probably wrong number. Daichen, I'll introduce you to a great doctor at our hospital. Feng Let's go. This is Shanshan. Sorry. Daichen Shanshan, I'll call you later. Let's go, don't say anything. What are you doing? Where are we going? Let's go. Where are you going? The exit's not here. Didn't I tell you not to say anything? What's with your attitude? Where on earth are you going? Let me go. Let's go. Why did you call me? How do you have my phone number? Can somebody tell me what's going on? You're hurting me, let go. Jiang Feng, you're scaring me. Jiang Feng Can't you see she doesn't want to go with you? Stop or I'll call the police. Jiang Feng, Jiang Feng, Jiang Feng, stop. Jiang Feng, let go of me. Stay away from her. Let go of me. Are you OK? I'm your husband, why don't you believe me? How can I believe you when you're acting like this? What's going on with that phone call? What on earth are you hiding? Daichen Please leave, I'm going to call the police. What are you doing? Ladies, is this man bothering you? This is my wife, it's a personal matter. Is that so? He has a knife. What's in your pocket? Show me your hands. Show them. Let go. Let go of me. Call the police. Let go of me. Officer Lei, when can Jiang Feng leave? You think it's my decision? Just go home and wait. Roughly how long?

Why don't we browse the flower market tomorrow? Get your mind off this. That's alright. With so much going on, I'm not in the mood. You're out of control. You're being too reckless. Why cover up for Chen Shanshan? I can't find any direct evidence that implicates her. Just wait for my memory to come back, I'll definitely find something that proves it's her. If we wait until then, I worry that these memories will be permanently with you. Is it worth it? Is letting the killer go unpunished worth it? Is having my wife and I live in constant fear worth it?

So, I wanted to pick out some flowers to decorate the house. Daichen, your husband is involved in that domestic violence case, you know? I heard a bit about that. I was the first to report Huilan's case to the police. I wanted to help her so badly, but in the end, I had to respect her own wishes. Who could have known, the next time I saw her, she was dead. the next time I saw her, she was dead. So I told myself, if I'm going to save somebody, I'll see it to the end. Even if it's beyond my professional duties. As long as I can help, I'll do anything I can. Daichen, don't blame me. Shanshan, actually my husband these past few days, even I have trouble recognizing him. But you must believe me, he really is a good person. Huilan used to tell me the same thing. Oh right, Daichen.

I need money from him, I'm out. I'll lend you some. OK. Xiaoyun, have you ridden this car before? Xiaoyun, can you tell me just who you're covering up for? Lei, where'd you get this picture? Where's my wife? Jiang Feng, you must remain calm. What you're about to see, don't overreact. Tell me, where is my wife? Jiang Feng, you were right. Chen Shanshan is the killer.

What is it? Let me see. Why won't you divorce him? You wouldn't understand. I can't stand to see him hit you again. At least I still have you. Too bad he's not dead. Too bad he's not dead. Don't say things like that. I'm sorry. I don't want to see him beat you anymore. Daichen, Daichen, he's awake. Feng, Easy now. Feng Daichen, you're OK. Ever since I woke up, he's been standing there. Don't be afraid. So close. If he had fired the gun, it'd all be over. So close. I never meant to cause you and your child trouble.
