This programme contains some strong language I refer to Montreux Jazz Festival as the Rolls-Royce of all festivals in the world, the Rolls-Royce. It's this golden gem tucked away. It's really a place of musical freedom. Lots of people who really, really love music, you know, coming together - it starts with that. The partying is secondary to the music. When I go to Montreux, no-one gives a fuck about this person sold 100 million records. That don't have shit to do with it. With Montreux, you're stripped of everything, and the only thing that keeps you radiant is your raw talent. The Montreux Jazz Festival is that graduation, that special place for musicians that reach that plateau. It blew my mind to be accepted there. This festival is the original prestige festival. All these performances will come out, and people see that we did something important. I feel so prestigious playing on the same stage as Aretha, Nina Simone, Prince. The one and only... ..Etta James!

JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS The person at the centre of this great festival was a crazy guy called Claude Nobs. He was the festival's founding father. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE INDISTINCT SPEECH This festival should be named Claude Nobs' Montreux Jazz Festival. INDISTINCT SPEECH He turned that sleepy village of Montreux, Switzerland, into a miraculous playground for great music. Many people who we count as stars today had their early days in Switzerland recorded via Claude Nobs. We're going to have a good time tonight. TRANSLATION FROM FRENCH: He brought a level of love which was so abundant that it almost felt like a love story. A love story through creation of art. INDISTINCT CONVERSATION He was like a walking encyclopaedia of jazz and blues. So that's how I connected with Claude. All he wanted to know was how much do you care? How much do you love music? How much do you love your life? And I think everybody, in the end, wants the same thing. We all want love and we all want that feeling of passion because that's what keeps us alive. That's the amazing story of Claude. He made his passion and his love real. TRANSLATION FROM FRENCH: CHEERING What was quite unique with Claude is that he was born here. Claude is a boy from Montreux, he's just linked to that area. CLAUDE: It was like a magic place. Games. Fun. But I didn't really care about school and about homework. All this sounded very unnecessary. I thought I could learn from myself and that all I needed to do was to do what I like to do. Hard work, clean living was what life was about. When Claude was all over the place during school, his father said, "OK, now, enough." CLAUDE: And I failed one examination when I was 17 at the high school in Lausanne, and that's when my father decided to get rid of me and said, "You're too lazy, tomorrow you decide "what you want to be in life." And I decided to be a cook. So he got me in touch with an old chef and told me, "I have a place for you in Basel." SOFT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS The chef in Basel used to work at the Grand Hotel in Territet, and he was a wonderful chef to me. We were cooking the old-fashioned way, no machine, everything had to be peeled by hand. I learned a lot and I got enthusiastic about cooking to the point that when I finished, I had the best note in all of Switzerland with 1.1. My big companion was my radio. I was listening to Europe 1, which was the first free radio. UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS The studio was in Paris, but the broadcasting tower was in Luxembourg, offland, you know, like a free part of Europe. I discovered a show, a nightly show called Pour Ceux Qui Aiment Le Jazz - For Those Who Love Jazz. and being a little kid, you know, I was 17 years old, this was my jazz education because they were explaining, you know, about jazz, explaining about R&B. On that radio station I heard the first Ray Charles, the first John Coltrane, all the first contemporary stuff and the first Atlantic recording, that's really where suddenly my favourite label became Atlantic. It was a liberation, it was an opening, it was a window to the world and it put me in touch with all kinds of other people. I could have carried on being a chef, maybe a pretty good chef, but I wanted to travel, I wanted to go into the hotel business. HORN BLOWS ARCHIVE: Introducing the Swiss Riviera, a beautiful playground and haven for millions since first the scenic and climatic wonders of this region were discovered. Breathtaking mountain panorama faces the peaceful resort town of Montreux, where all the advantages of a modern city are coupled with the delights of a quiet vacation spot. It's the Swiss Riviera. Happy holiday home. When he came back to Montreux, he met a gentleman called Raymond Jaussi, who we have to give some credit for everything because he was the man who did the renaissance of Montreux. His career was actually a military career in the Swiss Army and then he became a member of the Montreux tourist office. CLAUDE: Mr Jaussi saw what I was doing and "this is what you want to do in your life, "do you have a background in hotel management "and do you know about the banking system?" He said, "Well, I have a job for you. "Yeah, you can be the accountant at the tourist office in Montreux." He had this instinct and Claude really, really was so thankful to him to have given him this chance. Claude's mentor, really. When he started here, people thought, "Oh, Montreux, beautiful, "but so boring." It was full at the time of old English ladies coming to retire. It was very quiet. So he wanted to shake this place. Montreux, you know, I mean, it's a...it's a funny town. I think that's maybe why Claude shone out so brightly, because he was, for me, an island of culture in an otherwise fairly barren place. I thought he would have outgrown it or wanted to outgrow it, but instead, he made it grow up around him, you know? CHUCKLES Claude had in his head, "You know, we should do something with jazz." He thought we should do a jazz festival and so he went to Jaussi and said, "Why don't we do that?" And Jaussi said to him, "Well, look, end of June, beginning of July, "we have space in our hotels "and, you know, we could do something there. "I'll give you 10,000 CHF." Claude went to America because we knew that America had so much music potential. Claude Nobbs, I mean, it's incredible when you think about it. He decided that he wanted to have a jazz festival in this little tiny town in Switzerland and he got on a plane and had to pitch this festival that he was starting. I don't know how he did it. With Claude, it was maybe naive, but it was the heart speaking. You act like you feel. You don't explain, you just do. HE CHUCKLES He went to Atlantic Records and he says to the secretary, "I need to see Mr Nesuhi Ertegun." And the secretary said to him, "But you don't have a meeting, I can't disturb him." And he says, "But I came all the way from Switzerland to see him. Ertegun's door was open and he heard that this gentleman speaking this French English, and then he came out and says "gruezi", which means hello in Swiss-German. Nesuhi Ertegun was the son of the ambassador of Turkey in Bern, and he spoke German, so there was this immediate relationship. Atlantic Records became involved with Montreux. They loved Claude and they made it possible for their artists to go. Nesuhi Ertegun was very visionary and had this wonderful way to be with the artists. And Nesuhi saw in Montreux an extraordinary European platform for the artists. And when you think about it, I mean, here is this little kid who certainly didn't know anybody in this business, who put this town really on the map. It's mind-boggling, when you think about it. Bravo, I say. The rest is history. # I love the lie and lie the love # Are hanging on with push and shove # Possession is the motivation # That is hanging up the goddamn nation # Looks like we always end up in a rut # Everybody, now # Trying to make it real, compared to what? # Come on, baby # Slaughterhouses are killing hogs # Twisted children are killing frogs # Poor, dumb rednecks are rolling logs # Tired old ladies, kissing dogs # I hate the human love of that stinking mutt # He did it now # Trying to make it real, compared to what? # Trying to make it real, compared to what? # A real swinging cover, a real swinging band. Yeah. Woohoo! No! CHUCKLING: Oh, no. I've a wife and kids! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say hello to our foreign guests here. I'd like to say hello to all the musicians, and we hope to hear the best jazz you can give us. APPLAUSE IN FRENCH: Claude had to overcome so many obstacles that it was a miracle that he could hold a festival in a place like Montreux. He was a rather enterprising young man who figured out what to do. Jazz musicians loved going to Europe. They loved going to Montreux. Europe had a better relationship over the years to African-American musicians. They felt very comfortable in Europe. Europe was not perfect in any respect but it was certainly better. Everybody talked to everybody in this business. And the word just suddenly goes around. IN FRENCH: It's a great club, isn't it? Thanks very much. Thank you for being so generous, guys. Thanks again. All right. Thank you. All right, bye-bye. I'm holding him up. See you. You can go to dinner now. LAUGHTER Merci beaucoup. # I don't believe in fretting or grieving # Why mess around with strife? # I never was cut out to step and strut out # Give me the simple life # Some find it pleasant, dining on pheasant # Those things roll off my knife # Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes # Give me the simple life # A cottage small is all I'm after # Not one that's spacious and wide # A home that's full of joy and laughter # And the ones you love inside # Some like the high road, I'll take the low road # Free from the grief and strife # Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeedy # Give me the simple life # I never was cut out to step and strut out # Give me the simple life # Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes # Give me the simple life # A cottage small is all I'm after # Not one that's spacious and wide # A home that's full of joy and laughter # The ones you love inside # Some like the high road, I'll take the low road # Free from the grief and strife # Sounds corny and seedy # But yes, indeedy # Give me SHE SCATS AROUND THE LYRICS # The simple life. # Thank you! One, two, a-one, two, three, four. MUSIC STARTS, PETERS OUT One more time. Particularly that last one's got to be very "pow!", right on the button. One, two, three, four, two, two, three, four. MUSIC STARTS, PETERS OUT One more time. A-one, two, a-one, two, three, four. IN FRENCH: By the late 1960s, rock was eclipsing all other forms of popular music. Opening the festival out to rock bands, and away from the purity of jazz, I think, was a very important statement to make. Music grows, it evolves, it's a living organism. Good music is good music. Claude wasn't afraid to invite people who weren't jazz at all, but they had a musical integrity that allowed Claude to feel like, you know what, these people belong on this stage too. The rise of the rock album, the stereo system revolution and the proliferation of FM radio captured an entire generation of new listeners, and rock was able to connect with that generation. That really helped to expand the audience. I think a lot of people, a lot of fans who went to the Montreux Jazz Festival left there after that week with a much broader appreciation of music, a much broader awareness of the whole scene. The jazz people used to have little tables, a little champagne glass, you know? It was kind of old-style. And then Claude basically responded, actually, to what the youth of that generation wanted. And that's how the Jazz Festival became different from others. Claude invited Ten Years After to come, and that was a revolution. # Going home, my baby # Going home, my baby # Going home, my baby # Ah, baby, baby, I'm going home # Baby, baby, I'm going home # Love you, baby, I feel so good tonight # Going home, my baby # Going home, my baby # Going home, my baby # Ah, baby, baby, I'm going home # Baby, baby, I'm going home # Love you, baby, I feel so good tonight # Going home, my baby # Going home, my baby # Going home, my baby. # CLAUDE: When I started to promote rock concerts, my vision was totally different than when I listened to their music prior to seeing them live. I discovered very quickly that some of those guys were extremely gifted and weren't just making copies of American folk art or blues or folk music. They were really doing they're own thing. People like Jethro Tull, people like Pink Floyd, they definitely had their own genre and their own personality. I went to London to see Peter Grant, the manager of Led Zeppelin. And Peter had a reputation to be a very, very tough guy, very tough. So we talk about Led Zeppelin, how much I wanted them. And they came in '71. # We want you to get free, yeah They did two shows and came back in '72. It was a big sell-out, their only show in Europe. And I never had a contract. Peter just said, you know, "Make sure that the guys are happy." And they just loved it. It was a great, great, great time. On the first show, there was so many people without tickets that Peter said, let's put some extra speakers out by the pool, so people can enjoy the concert live. I'd like to introduce Led Zeppelin. On lead guitar, Jimmy Page. ROCKING GUITAR SOLO And myself, Robert Plant. # I want you to # I want you to # Yes, I do! # Suddenly, Montreux became the Mecca of pop and rock in Switzerland. Suddenly, we had people coming from Rome, from Berlin, from Scandinavia, because they were unique shows, it was the only way, in a small setting, to see those big groups. And we had all the hippies, so the people in Montreux would go to the casino and there was, like, a big barrier around the swimming pool. In the afternoon, of course, all the hippies were sunbathing and taking baths and the Montreux people would go and look through those grills, like it would be in a zoo, like it was the elephant and the crocodile and this and that. I remember that we had thousands of tents in the garden, where people would come and sleep in those tents. They could sleep in the garden, nobody would bother them, they would leave in the morning because the police car would come and say, "If you don't leave, then you may be peed on by the dogs "while taking their early walk." This was our generation and we were certainly a bit crazy and maybe a bit naive. Everybody was sitting down, smoking their dope, what have you. But that was the beginning. This was kind of this brouhaha of people coming from everywhere. We had just done Woodstock, and so everything we saw at Woodstock was an affirmation that humans can and will coexist together with unity and harmony. Being in Montreux Jazz Festival in 1970, I couldn't believe it had so many different kind of bands. And just walking around, looking at the mountains and the lake and everything, it was like being inside of a dream, but you're awake. # You got persuasion # I can't help myself # You got persuasion # I can't help myself # Something about you, baby # Keeps me from going to somebody else # Yeah, I'm where you want me now, now, now, baby # You put me in a daze all the time # Look what you got for me, baby # Like the devil in disguise # Something about you, baby # You're one, you're one of a kind # Oh, this spell you put on me is just like thunder, babe # I can't keep the rain from coming down # Look out now, can't get out from under # But I wouldn't want to even if I can # Something about you, baby # Make me feel, make me feel like a man. # IN FRENCH: INTERVIEWER ASKS A QUESTION Ah, d'accord. Jack? Ready? OK. Maybe some clapping hands? One, two, uh... It just needs to be a stomp. SHE VOCALISES IN RHYTHM I think that's what it is. Claude's heart was in taking chances. And he cultivated an audience that supported that. He wanted to share his joy and help them to feel what he has felt all his life about this music. He worshipped the life force of the artist that's making that music. He had this vision half a century ago to put that much passion into a project like that. Bringing people together in situations that they wouldn't necessarily normally be in. I think if you have enough of a thirst for this knowledge and culture, you eventually do find it. # You've not been hit by flying lead # You'd better close your eyes # Ah-ah # Bow your head # And wait for the ricochet # Ooh-ooh... # We first came to Montreux on the regular circuit. If you were playing any tour of Europe, chances are you'd play the Montreux Casino. We hated studios at the time, we just didn't like the sound we were getting in studios. We looked around for a live setting and the Casino came up, it was available. Claude Nobs, who ran it, said, yeah, you can, there's no-one coming in. And so that was the arrangement. We had the Rolling Stones' mobile truck and it arrived here we all arrived here. And he said, "Actually, "there's one more gig to go before you can start moving your gear in, "and that's a Frank Zappa gig, which is tomorrow afternoon at 3pm, "matinee performance." This guy came in, right over my right shoulder, two flares, like Roman candles, from a flare gun, just went into the trunking in the back of the building. Seemed to fizzle out but then they caught fire. That was it, that was the venue gone. We went down the lake to the Eden au Lac hotel and watched the wind from the mountains blowing the flames and smoke. The shock of this whole place burning down was pretty amazing. I mean, that was Claude's life going up in flames. I woke up one morning in the hotel, I said the words out loud, smoke on the water. Let's write the story of how we made the album. MUSIC: Smoke On The Water, by Deep Purple. # We all came out to Montreux # On the Lake Geneva shoreline # To make records with a mobile # We didn't have much time # But Frank Zappa and the Mothers # Were at the best place around # But some stupid with a flare gun # Burned the place to the ground # Smoke on the water # A fire in the sky # Smoke on the water # It burned down the gambling house # It died with an awful sound # Funky Claude was running in and out # Pulling kids out the ground # When it all was over # We had to find another place... #
