No, no, no. This line starts behind me. - That will be 50 kronor. - No. It will be 35 kronor. This is only valid if you buy two bouquets. Sweetie, I only need one bouquet. Half of 70 is still only 35. One bouquet costs 50 kronor. Two bouquets together cost 70 kronor. That doesn't make any sense. It's pure madness. I'm reporting this to the Consumer Ombudsman. - Is there a manager here? - No, she's at lunch. Lunch? Learning to count would be a better pursuit. Two prices for the same thing? That's pure madness. But just so you know... Two bouquets won't be a habit. I miss you. A MAN CALLED OVE Good-for-nothings. - The dog should stop peeing at our place. - Don't listen to the mean old man. Anders! Did you see what the old man did? He tried to kill Prince. - What did you do to the dog? - That's no dog. It looks like a pair of winter boots with eyes. - Walking dogs here isn't allowed. - Don't involve the police. Can't you say something to him, Anders? You're Chairman of the Board. - I just did exactly that. - No, I mean properly. Good morning. - Everything okay? - Aren't you chatty? - Ove! Can we have a moment with you? - In the office. Now you'll be fucking promoted, eh? - Is everything well? - Yes. - How long have you worked here, Ove? - 43 years. - Shit. - Shit. - You took over your father's job? - Yes. We have an opportunity for you. You're only 59. You might want to do something else with your life. Does 43 years at the same place suggest that? It... - You want to fire me. - That isn't exactly how I'd express it. But it's close. - We want to offer you a program. - A kind of government-run training course. - A further step. - The digital is taking over more and more. Yeah, then I have a proposal. Isn't it easier if I just get up and leave? Good. Then that's what we'll do. Wait, Ove. We have a farewell present. A garden spade. You need to forward your phone service there if you're going to travel. - There aren't any phones there. - You're joking? Take it easy. Come on. Careful. Hello, hello! Stop. Stop! Stop! - Oh dear. - What the fuck? - Drive forward a little. Patrick! - What are you doing? - He's not very smart. - Driving here isn't permitted. - Can't you read Swedish signs? - Are you blind? Am I the one driving? Nice to meet you. Patrick. You should be called Mickey Mouse, but if you're backing up - - turn the opposite direction and look in the rear-view mirror. - What's she saying? - No idea. It's Persian. Isn't it beautiful? No... no, hello! - No, no! - Did I hit something? Out, now! Stand someplace where you aren't in the way. - Remember... - Thanks. I can drive a car. - What is that, now? - The backup camera. Camera? What fucking cam... - Hi. - Hey, you. Mom! Backup cameras? You shouldn't even have a cassette tape. - Petter! - Idiots. Fuck, I can't find my jacket. - Petter! Petter! - Yeah. - Come here! Petter! - What do you want? PARKING ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN! Scram! You took my bike. Can I get it back? - Wasn't it a woman's bike? - It's my girlfriend's. - And where does she live? - 142 over there. With the communists who introduced waste sorting? - Then she can get it herself. - Whatever. - Should I let him take my bike? - He's weird. Hey, Ove. Everything okay? Why does everyone ask if it's okay? Why wouldn't it be okay? You're not working. It's the middle of the day and you've never been sick. Do you want something? Or do you like talking your life away? Do you want come get some lunch? Idiots! Bloody maniacs! Driving here is not permitted! - Did you say something, or? - Yeah, driving here is forbidden. - Oh yeah? Well, I have permission. - The hell you do. - Goodbye. - Drive! - Get away from here! Is something wrong? If you have visitors, there's guest parking. That's what we decided. They were from the municipality. They were bringing Rune home. We've been getting so cold inside. Can you take a look? No. Put on another blanket. Sorry I didn't come yesterday like I was supposed to. I just couldn't. It's been a real circus at home. New neighbors moved in across the way. You'd be shocked how people are these days. No one can do anything anymore. They can't back up with a trailer, or change a tire. When you ask them the simplest thing in the world, they're eating lunch. Think about it. Soon we'll have a country where everyone is busy eating lunch. You're lucky you don't have to be a part of it. A white car showed up in the area. Complete maniacs. There's no order when you aren't home. If I hurry now, maybe we can even see each other today. I miss you. What the fuck now. Yeah? What's the matter? - We have rice and chicken. - Are you selling rice? It's just a little food to thank you for your help. Persian food with saffron. Damn good. Parvaneh is insanely good at cooking - - and I am insanely good at... The trailer is gone. I saw the note. Totally right, it was our fault. - We thought you might be little hungry. - No, I'm not hungry. - Then we'll throw it out. - No, nothing is thrown out here. - We thought we heard you have a ladder. - Of course I have a ladder. Everyone should have a ladder here. It's in the bylaws, in fact. If you are familiar with them. Then maybe could we... borrow it? It feels safe with a guy who's always home. Here are the supports. And the instruction manual. So... Fuck! - Do you have an 'insect' key? - Hex key. No, 'insect' key. What does it have to do with insects? Six sides - hex key. Google it. Ove? Can you look at the heating now? - If I ask nicely? - Try to bleed the radiator. - Could that be it? - Hi. I'm Parvaneh. - This is my husband Patrick. - Always nice to meet new neighbors. God, how nice it is here. It's paradise for the kids. Goddammit. Does no one have a job anymore? - Aren't you going to 'lift' her radiator? - Bleed. One doesn't lift radiators. One bleeds them. Maybe Rune should have asked me about the heating before the coup d'etat. - Please, Ove, it wasn't a coup d'etat. - A coup was what it was! - Do you want the supports, or what? - Yeah, yeah. Ove was Chairman of the Board, then everyone voted for my husband Rune. Parvaneh! Check it out. They're damn nice... Don't take them. They were for Sonja. - The thing is that she was in... - Now shut your mouth! Quiet! Now that's enough! Get out of here, everybody! Go home! Get out of here! Paradise, huh? Ove? Ove? Can you come look at something? Yeah. Should I come there? Ove? - How nice the bookshelf is. - Yeah. How many books do you have? It's these here and the box in the kitchen, and then the ones in the storeroom. I'll build another. They say the brain works faster as it dies. As if the impressions of the outside world become slow-motion. I had time to think about a good deal. Mostly about the radiator, actually. And about Mom. She died early. Dad wasn't one of those people who showed sadness. - Thanks for coming. - I didn't, either. It is what it is. One thing is for sure. Whatever we do in this life, we will not live past it. Come on, Ove, we're going home. Dad didn't say much. He mostly cared about the house. And cars. Clearly they didn't say much either. Cars can give you freedom. But if you act like an asshole with them, they'll take it from you right away. But that night, he talked. Ove? I want you to know how everything is connected. - Uh. In a Saab 92. - Yeah. - And what do the spark plugs do? - They make the car go. Exactly. This, Ove... This is the life! They're never going to make a better car than Saab. But for the most part, he said nothing at all. After school, I went to Dad's job. - Hey, Dad! - Hey, Ove! He said it was safest. Get off the track, Ove! - Get off the track, Ove! - What are you saying? Behind you! It was probably the first time in my life that my father hugged me. I don't know why, but for some strange reason I thought of Mom. You have to be more careful. He probably did, too. Then I got the opportunity. There. Ove, it's okay now. Now let Dad go. Everyone said that he was too nice. How can one be too nice? I got to know my father's fine colleagues. - Tom was one of them. - Give it back. - No. I found it. - You're going to get such a beating... Sometimes one doesn't know if what one is doing is the right thing. - It's just a feeling one gets. - You fucking little brat. Sometimes feelings can be associated in a strange way with direct pain. We find what we keep. That's how it's always been. Always. Ove? Do whatever you want with the purse. It was you who found it. - I found it on the train. - Thank you so much. - Why didn't you tell on Tom? - We don't talk about what others do. - I thought about keeping the purse. - Yeah, I know. But in the end you gave it back. Honesty is the best thing, Ove. But sometimes honesty needs a little help. - Do you understand? - Yeah, very well. I understand. Come on, let's go home. Hop on. Finally the day came when I got to know real freedom. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Ove. - How did it go? - Yeah, you... see for yourself. It was damn good. Did you see? Guys? Have you seen Ove's marks? He's going to be our next foreman! What? Fives and fours. Fantastic. Call the foreman! Call the foreman, for fuck's sake! Dad! What the hell? What's this fucking garbage you're selling? Universal rope, you said. "Holds everything". What did you use it for? Ugh! Idiot. It's impossible to get a proper rope anymore. The new neighbors keep making a mess. Eating rice with saffron. What's wrong with meat and potatoes? One doesn't need to pour fancy things in the food! This must be the first time you've had to wait for me. - Hey! What are you doing? - It scratched Prince. Throw another stone and I'll sew a doormat with your mop! It's a chihuahua. And the cat surely has both rabies and the plague. Clearly you do, too. But we don't throw stones at you. You still think that you can do what you want? Slimy fucking old man. - I'm going to tell Anders. - Well, go ahead. If you can make someone who drives an Audi understand. Four zeros on the grill and a fifth at the wheel. If it pisses on our fences again, I'll electrify them! Idiot. Yeah, that applies to you, too. Scram! This is private property. August 27th, you borrowed my hose. I need it now. - Are you going to water in March? - You watered, now I'm watering. Can't you look at the radiator now that you're here? Thanks. That was really nice. I have food on the stove. Want some? - Thanks, I've eaten. - I see. I'll just get the hose. Rune? Rune? Just so you know, people do whatever the fuck they want in the association. Everything you and I built is going to ruin. To hell with it. I don't care. In fact, I'm thinking of leaving here. For good. I'm going to Sonja. I thought you'd be glad to know. You can't do anything about it. Just sit and watch as everything... The food is almost ready. Thanks for loaning it. It was really nice of you. - You don't want a little food? - No. - Jimmy's eating, too. - Stuffed cabbage, Ove. Damn good. - Rune would certainly appreciate it. - He neither hears nor understands a thing. Rune understands a lot more than people think. It's as if he knows exactly what's going on in our heads. Yeah, I have to go now. Let go of the hose. Let go of the hose! Hey, Ove! We're trying to put up a window. - From outside? Good luck! - You're holding the ladder, right? You should be holding the ladder. Where are you going now? THANKS, IT WAS GOOD OVE One can count on a Saab, at least. The Director will see you now. What a pity this was. If we can help you with anything, just say so. They were fine grades. It's yours. That's half of Dad's salary up to the end of the month. He always paid in advance. - We can't take the money back. - What's right is right. Maybe we can find another solution. I knew how it was done, and I knew all of Dad's colleagues. What are you going to do now that Dad is in heaven? No, not that. Not that. Not that. There comes a time when one must decide - - who one wants to be. Now we're even for the purse, you little shit. For me, it was exactly then. The watch is mine! - Are you Ove Lindahl? - Yes. - We've been looking for you. - Oh yeah? We're going to take a look at your house. There's a new zoning plan for the area. The house isn't appropriate for future building plans. No, Stig, we'll clear everything. You see yourself. It's a tear-down. It was the first time I met them, but not the last. They never told me their names, just where they were from. The men in the white shirts. And they always got what they wanted. - Ove? Fika break. - Finally, it was finished. And it wasn't so bad if I say so myself. But the men in the white shirts didn't like it. Hi. Some people say that fate is the result of our own stupidity - - so one can probably say that what changed my fate - - was the result of my neighbors' stupidity. Is anyone in the house? Is anyone in the house? Help! Hello? Hello?! Help! - Disconnect the fire hose! - I'm going in! I tried to reason with the firemen. But then he showed up again. Turn off the water. Turn off the water! It's going to be demolished anyway. Stop extinguishing! The white shirt. How long have we been going? - About an hour. - Damn! I could have woken you if I knew you were getting off. You were so cute when you slept. Did you oversleep? No. It's no problem. Tickets. - Thank you. - I don't have a ticket. Then you have to buy a ticket. - I'm sorry, I have no money, either. - I've got it. There. - I'll pay you back, of course. - That's alright. I'm reading The Master and Margarita. - Do you know it? - No. There's a cat in the book who also doesn't pay his fare. Have you read any Mikhail Bulgakov? - No, I haven't read any of he. - Of him. - Mmhmm. - I'm studying to be a teacher. I'm getting off here. Wait! You forgot this. After that day, I got up every morning and took the 7:30 train. But she'd completely disappeared. After three weeks, I was about to give up. - Hey. - Hey. - Do you usually take this train? - Yeah. I'm in the army. In... the regiment. Mmhmm. Oh! I thought you should get your money back. Wouldn't it be nicer to ask me to dinner? Dinner? Sure. I don't really have anywhere to cook dinner. I meant at a restaurant. Oh. Okay. Mmhmm. - If you usually go to restaurants. - Yeah. - Then that's that. - Absolutely. Hey! Hello. - You're fifteen minutes late. - Oh yeah? Am I? So... - Do you know anything about cars? - About cars? It's maybe a bit interesting to know how they run. - It's not as simple as one thinks. - Uhhuh. Think of a car. A Saab 93, perhaps. It needs a power source, an engine. And Saab uses piston engines. And the piston drives a crankshaft. The clever thing about Saabs is that they're front-wheel drive. So it doesn't need a propeller shaft. - Dad was also into cars. - Mm. - You've eaten next to nothing. - No, I ate at home. Mmhmm. Why did you eat at home? So that you could order what you wanted. I lied to you. I'm not in the army. I clean trains. And my house burned down. And I'm going to go now. Thanks, it was nice. She asked what I was interested in. I answered, "houses", because it was the only thing that came to mind. Then she told me about a training course. Two years later, I was an educated engineer. - Congratulations! - Thanks. Oh, how nice. Well... let's see what's on your diploma. - "Ove Lind... " - Will you marry me? I thought that if you'd like to, we... Speak calmly and clearly. - Will you marry me? - Yes! Yes, I will! Yeah, yeah! Ow! Ow! Goddammit! Shit! - What are you doing? - What are YOU doing? - You have to drive me to the hospital now. - For a little nosebleed? Patrick fell off the ladder. I could have figured that out, the ass. Drive yourself. Take the little Japanese sewing machine you came in the other day. I don't have a driver's license. - How old are you? - 30. - 30 years old and no driver's license? - Patrick went in an ambulance and may die. - But I can take the bus. Thanks! - I'll drive, then. Great. At last. Was that so hard? - Where are you going now? - To get the kids. - It smells disgusting. - Mom, I can't breathe. - Roll down the windows, then. - No, not the windows. Roll them up. Roll up the windows. - Stop! - Can you go a little faster? Please, Ove, no one is going to ticket you at a hospital. It's only going to take fifteen minutes. He's in for observation. I'm going in, so we'll meet here later, OK? - Wait a second. What about the children? - They'll have to stay with you. Hey! - Book. - Yeah, I see that. - Book. - She wants you to read it. "Herr Brum has just started to do what he does every Tuesday. " "When you grow up, you're going to be a train driver, Guld-Ivar exclaims. " - Book isn't that fun. - No, I don't like it either. You have to speak with a story voice, and sound like a talking bear. - There aren't any talking bears. - This one does. "I've already been a train driver for a long time, says Herr Brum. " Yeah! Exactly like that, very good! "Herr Brum presses a red button. " - "Hundreds of Frantic Honeybees"... - Hey, kids! - Look, a clown! - Beppo the Clown is here! Hey! - Do you want to see a magic trick? - I was reading a story to the children. He was reading a story to the children... But now I'm here. Do you have a five kronor coin? I need five kronor for my trick. Give him a five. Thanks. Now the show begins! Can you tell me where you live? - How can you just leave my children? - I didn't leave your children. These untalented, pretend policemen forced me. We decided that your father was a security risk. I just wanted my five kronor back! Ta-da! Beppo the Clown thanks you. Hey, wait! This isn't the five kronor coin that I gave you. - Poor baby. - I want my five kronor. Are you a total idiot? Hey! What are you doing over there? It's not my fault he had long shoes. It's not even funny, just impractical. - Fuck! This is insane! - Uhhuh. What did I say? - I'll take it. It's my fine. - It's my car. - Bye, Ove. - Bye, Ove! Intercity 3214 is passing on track 3. Come help, for fuck's sake! Are you stupid? Give me your hand. Give me your hand now! Come on, dammit! Are you an idiot? Dad! What is it with you? Do you want to fucking die or something? - You saved he. - Him. "Saved him" is how you say it. Idiot. Ove! Nasanin made a drawing for you. Wait there. Wait there. Here. Nasanin made a drawing for you. The one in color is you. She always draws you in color. - Always? - I have the world's best idea. You and I should practice driving. Patrick sure can't, and you're a lot better. - No, I don't have time. - I'll pay for fuel, of course. Isn't it a good idea? ... What was that? Oh god, poor little thing! There. Ow, ow, ow. - Open the door. - Not in my house. Open the door now! God, it's freezing in here. Grab a blanket. - Why? - Quickly. Now! Hey, man. I was outside and heard someone shout. No, I know something faster. Wait. They say fat people generate a ton of heat. - I'll get something to dry with. - No, not in the kitchen! What is this? Shit, it's so low. - It's for Sonja. My wife. - Where is she now? She's... dead. She cooked like the devil. I ate here all the time. Right, Ove? I think she's doing a little better now. Who's going to take her? I can't. My children are really allergic. Oh, fuck, I forgot. I'm allergic, too. It's not as easy to kill oneself as one thinks. But she moved in, too. I have to get rid of her. But I'll come back later. I promise, Sonja. She looked like this from the start. Don't think I had anything to do with it. See you soon, then. I thought you didn't like children. Of course I like children, but I just don't know if I'd be a good father. Ove, you'd be the best father our children could have. I promise. Idiot! Sorry, Ove! Did I hit you? I'm practicing with Anders now. - Hey, Ove. - Is that dandy going to teach you to drive? - You didn't want to drive with me. - We should probably have seatbelts on. - Right. - Ah, let me just... - Sorry. - Bye! - Weeee! - Hey, hey, hey. Be careful. Please, be careful with Dad's leg. How did it go? - I'll take her if you get the door. - Sit here. Do you have the green sign? One needs it on the back when practicing driving. I can't watch an idiot teach another idiot to drive. Cool. Thanks! - Hey, Ove. Everything okay? - Learn to read the instructions. Hey! What lovely weather for driving practice. Here's some Persian cookies. I bake about as good as I drive. Sit. Stop. It's red. I'm useless. Now it's green. You can drive now. Don't forget the clutch. God, he's stressing me out! Start it again. Let go of the key. Clutch up and gas down. - That's what I'm doing! - Leave the clutch... I can't do it! No, you bastard! Have you never been a beginner? Don't you see the sign? - Take it easy, little old man. - "Little old man"! I'm no fucking "little old man" to you, you fucking bastard. I'm "big old man". Honk one more time and it'll be the last thing you do. Got it? Now you listen to me. You've had two children - - and you're about to spit out a third. You came here from Iran, fleeing war and whatever the hell else. You learned a new language, got an education and a livelihood. And you're married to a good-for-nothing. You can fucking learn to drive, too. It's not brain surgery. Start the car now, then just drive. Idiot. Good. No, no, no. I already got it. No, no, no. Over here. This was Sonja's favorite bakery. Every Thursday at 1:00 we sat here. Right at this table. And ate napoleon pastries? - How did you know that? - It's Thursday, 1:00. What did you do after? At 2:00 we went home. Sonja usually read some books, and Rune and I usually washed the car. It had to be hand-washed. No machines scratching the paint. Rune? - You don't even talk to each other. - We did at the time. Actually, we were probably quite similar. Stop! Stop, I said! - Rune. - Ove. - We worked together. - I'll take a shortcut across the field. - You don't do that. - You can tell your friends that, too. We shared the same values. At the association's first meeting, I was chosen as Chairman of the Board - - and Rune as Vice Chairman. A wise choice, we thought. We were both probably surprised to have found a friend. Until we finally discovered that little difference between us. - You drive a Volvo? - Yeah. What do you drive? Saab. At first, we tried to ignore the problem and hang out as usual. We handled it nicely. It's a boy! The years went by. We lost touch. But then, without warning, the bastard threw me off the Board. I was so pissed off - - that I went out and bought a Saab 9000 CS. Then Rune bought a 960 Executive. When their boy had grown up - - he suddenly decided to move to the USA. They didn't say much after that. I had just looked at the new Saab 9-5- - and thought it was time to put old grudges behind us. - We just had to talk again. - I've been thinking. Isn't it time we put old grudges behind us? Of course. We're friends. - That was when it happened. - Do you want to see my new car? BMW. I turned around and went home. Rune gave up forever. Surely one can't drive Volvos his whole life? It was the last betrayal. Did you never have children? It's 2:00 now. Ove, I have to do the written part as well. Can you help me? Uhhuh. It's part of the driver's test. Thanks. That will be really nice. You know them already. - Who? - The children, of course. - I don't know if this is such a good idea. - Me neither. Maybe I should stay home? No, it's a really good idea. - Call if anything comes up. - Bye. I'm hungry, I'm hungry! You're against animal testing, but not against testing on children. Nasanin wants formula before we go to bed. You have to wash the bottle yourself. Dad can't install the dishwasher. He says that he's going to throw the dishwasher out the window. Come, you have to see my room. What's important to think about when building a house? Water. - And sewage. - Exactly. And infrastructure, too. - Have you built houses before? - Yes, but no stone houses. He said I was the best in the class. Did you agree to this? No! Wow... - Sepideh? - Hi, Mom. She's sleeping. What's this? What are you doing? You again? Regarding the woman's bicycle, it says, "Bicycle parking absolutely forbidden". Didn't Sonja live here? I was her student. I couldn't read or write, but she didn't think I was stupid. Then I learned everything. She was great. Sorry for bothering you. - Hey! What are you doing with the bike? - Fixing it for my girlfriend. Maybe my girlfriend if I fix it. I have to go to my other job. I work at a kebab stand, too. I'm saving for a car. A Renault. French? You're going to buy a French car? Then an old student of yours showed up, too. So now I have to sort out another thing before I can come. That's just how it is. Stop! Hello! Good. Turn it off. Now you can parallel park, too. - I just hit a car. - It's nothing. It was a Volvo. Wait here. I have to do something. The bike is fixed now. So you can give it to your girlfriend. - Did you fix it? - I just changed the tube. - You eat kebabs? - No, why would I do that? - What's he doing here? - Why do you have black around your eyes? - It's makeup. - I thought girls used that. - He thinks he looks great with it. - Mmhmm. - He won't get any girls. - I don't want any girls. - Are you a fag? - Ove! One doesn't say that. - He can say what he wants. - Are you one of those gay people? Yes. I'm one of those gay people. I see. What are you fussing about? Don't say anything about Mirsad. His Dad doesn't know about it. I don't go around talking about what others do. - You have a much worse problem. - What's that? Buying French cars? It might be good to know what makes a car run. It's not as simple as one thinks. I have to pee. - We should go over the engine. - I can't. I'll be quick. - Hi. You're Ove, right? - You're parked outside the lines. Lena Samuelsson, local newspaper. It's about the accident at the train station. You saved a man's life there. - You're wrong, that wasn't me. - I was there and saw it all. We have a series called "The Invisible Heroes". I think you would be a good fit. I'm sure a lot of exciting things happened in your life. - Will you talk about it? - No. I have a letter from the man you saved. You have to read it. - It's really touching. Wait... - I'm ready now. - There won't be anything. - Why? What was that? - I didn't hear anything. Come on. - Can you open up? Well, so what? I didn't lock it. Even an idiot can open it from inside. Idiots. Ove! Wait. Did you think she'd disappear just because you locked her in the garage? God... You fucking knob. Ove... - I just thought of something. - Stop bragging. Seriously. I can help you clean your house a bit. - Put things in boxes and the like. - That won't be necessary. - Sonja's things are still out. - That won't be necessary, I said. - Wouldn't it be nice to move on? - I said that you should stop talking! I've never met Sonja, and she was certainly wonderful. But you made her into some sort of saint. She probably would have wanted to be a regular Sonja. A wonderful, but regular Sonja. - Quiet, I said! - Don't yell. The more all the idiots babble about her - - their noise drowns out that little memory of her voice that I have left. There was nothing before Sonja. And there's nothing after, either. I exist. No, you bastard! Stop, for fuck's sake! Stop! Wait a second. If you're done with your neanderthal manners - - then we'll probably get along. - Move. - Never. Go back, get lost. If you have a problem with us driving here, call the administrator at the municipality. - You can help Rune in other ways. - I don't give a shit about Rune. Driving in here isn't permitted. Not another meter. What is it with you really, Ove? I know what it is. You're paranoid. I did a little research on you in the municipality archives - - and on the internet. And I know everything. I've read all your silly posts, your letters to the authorities. I know everything about your wife and her accident. And how you blame everything and everyone for it. But you know, what if it was just that you weren't enough. I'm going to report you. I'm employed by a private healthcare company. We only do things that have already been decided. You must be scared about that heart, Ove. What do you know about my heart? Huh? - What do you know about my heart, then? - Drive. Answer! What do you know about my... Stop the car! Stop the car now! You fucking idio... Fucking white shirts! What?! This is the last warning! Tomorrow that winter boot will be a moccasin! Now he's really crazy. Just forget it. Forget it, dammit. No! Fight! - Fucking white shirts. - Ove. Ove, hello? Open up! Hello, Ove? How are you? - Ove! You should stop now. It's ready. Yep. Wait. Close your eyes first. Close your eyes. Here. Here. Stop. Ta-da! - What's this? - Come, we're going to dance. - No. No, no. - Yes! Yes. Come on. Come on. I can't. You can dance on the inside. Ove. You're going to be a father. We're going to be parents! I love you, Ove. I love you, too. - But then we have to buy a station wagon. - Yeah, or a cradle. Good idea. I'll build one. Fucking rascals! What are you doing? Uhh... - We just wanted to ask something... - What?! Mirsad was kicked out of his house. I thought that maybe he could live here. Here? Do you think this is a fucking hotel? Mirsad came out today. I told my dad that I was one of those gay people. And he hates fags. He'd kill himself if any of his children were. But yeah, yeah, whatever. We're going. Sonja always helped other people. Okay, come on, then. Good morning. I made some toast, if that's okay. And I made a little coffee, too. - I'm going to go on my rounds. - Aren't you going to have coffee first? I made a little bit here. Sandwiches with cheese and stuff. Before the rounds? No, I have to go do the rounds now. Can I come along? It's a free country. Oh? Okay. Wait! Hey. Can I come with? I started exercising. - Hey. Jimmy. - Hey. Mirsad. - Did you fight with your father? - Yeah. He didn't jump for joy. - Did you hear about Rune? - No. They're picking him up tomorrow. He's going to go in the institution. Bullshit. It takes years before it happens. Ask me, I know. I promise. The decision was made. They're coming tomorrow. She appealed three years ago. So now they'll be separated. Three years. Lies. Sonja would have known about that. - Me too. - Anita said nothing to Sonja. - She didn't want you to know. - Why didn't she want us to know? She didn't want to ask for help. She said that you had enough problems of your own. She said that? She said we shouldn't know because we had enough of our own problems? Yeah, so what? Idiot. That's what I've been. You mustn't be angry with me, Sonja. It's hard to admit that one's been wrong. Especially when one's been wrong for a long time. I'm sorry. But now it's going to be put right. I know how you tend to worry when I fight. But this time, I think you'll agree with me. Now it's fucking war! Give me every single paper between you and the municipality - - and insurance office, county, church. I want the works on Rune. To cancel your service, press star. Can I borrow your phone? For the neighbors. It doesn't fucking matter if we've already appealed. Because there's a higher court. Can't you read? Are you illiterate? Illiterate! Hello? Hello?! How can one reason with people who hang up? - How can you reason if you're just yelling? - They're not listening. Sit down. Turn that off. It's the same people all the time. The same people. That's how it's always been. Their names are different, but they're the same. The only place for a municipality bastard. Those fucking white shirts. Listen to yourself. You said to me that one never gives up, right? Then you sit there and feel sorry for yourself. Because you had it bad, everyone's an idiot... So you just give up. All because you think everyone on this planet can manage without help. But you know what, Ove? No one manages alone. No one. Not even you. You can go now. You can go, I said. I don't have to energy for you anymore. It was her idea from the start. That we'd travel together, just she and I, before the child came. She was adamant that we should go by bus. Because that was more romantic, she said. And I didn't object. It was a little cheaper, too. Down in Spain, Sonja thought that one should do as the Romans do. I discovered that the Spaniards had a lot to learn - - when it came to Swedish building standards. We had it good. In the evenings, we went out and ate. We saved a little food from the lunch buffet - - that made for a fine dinner outside. Skal. One day it was time to go home. Hola. - Hola. - No thanks. No, no! - What did he say? - He seems happy. We come, we come, from Pepperkaker land. on the road, on the road, we wander hand in hand. - Let them be, Ove. - What? - They're having fun. - They are? On the bus, Sonja wanted me to feel her stomach - - because the child, she kicked in there. Here, feel. - Do you feel it? - It's constant. I'm just going to go to the toilet. Sonja? Sonja? Sonja? Sonja! Help! Help! You can go in to her. I probably sat with her for a week. Not a soul dared to talk to me. And that was probably for the best. Until one day... They said that Sonja would never wake up. Don't you fucking say that to me! And then, inexplicably, it happened. It was as if the best and the worst happened at the same time. The day after, I was forced to tell her about everything that happened. About a life that no longer existed. In the midst of that pain, I felt a kind of inner strength. At first, I turned that anger into something fruitful. Sonja continued to study. She had a year left on her teaching degree. But when she finished, there were no jobs. I'm really sorry, but you have good grades. At that time, the schools weren't handicap-accessible. But then one day, Sonja saw an ad in the paper. A class where they bundled all the letter combinations that existed - - before the combinations were even invented. Your CV seems really good, but we're unable - - to take on a disabled teacher. Then I went into the great darkness. I wanted to obliterate everyone. Every bastard. The bus company, the driver - - the vineyard, the travel company... everyone. I wrote to the Spanish and Swedish governments - - but no one cared. The idea is that one expands the entrance... They didn't even want to build a ramp so that Sonja could start at the school. I wrote to everyone to try to get some justice - - for something I didn't even know the answer to myself. Until finally, Sonja... She was the strongest of all. Ove. Either we die or we live. That night, I took the car and built what was needed in one night. The next day, Sonja was able to start working. Welcome. Homer wrote The Iliad about the Trojan war. But when was The Iliad written? - David? - The year 700. - B.C. - Tool. Let's say hello to Richard Stenebo. Welcome to our class. - Hi, Richard! - Welcome. I'm not lying. In one year, the same student could - - cite 400-year-old poetry with ease at graduation. So infinite in her skills. So like a god in her form - - and her actions. A model of an animal. Yet, to me... ...she's only dust. Bravo! She fought for what was good. For the child she never had. She died six months ago - from cancer. And I promised to follow her. - Today's the day. Is he ready? - Don't come any farther. You've had three years to prepare for this nice and peacefully. The decision was made. - We're doing this for your sake, Anita. - What about love? Separating when you need each other most? The problem is that he has no idea where he is 24 hours a day. No, but I know. Oh! - And who's going to take care of him? - I will. - With a little help... from... - A little help? From who? - Hi, how nice. Lena, from the local paper. - Hey. I have the last three years' statements from the healthcare company Konsensus - - that you're a shareholder of. There's a marginal profit reported. At the same time, I have statements from a bank in the Canary Islands. It's had millions in deposits. - Where did you get them? - On the internet. My editor would be happy to run this - - but the decision is mine, if you understand what I mean. He left right away. It was better in our time. Then, people at least fought for their principles. Ove! Ove! Ove! Call an ambulance! Don't let the fucking ambulance drive into the association. Over by the window. Hi. Parvaneh, you're listed as next of kin. Your dad suffers from a heart condition. One could say his heart is too big. - Sorry, too big? - Yes. But he'll survive. Ove! You're too fucking sick to die. Oh shit, I think this is the day, Ove! Shit! It was just gathering dust. - But it was never used. - It's really nice, Ove. Thanks. - It might need to be painted a bit. - Here, hold the baby. I'm going to show it to Patrick. Hey, you. Just lie down here... You're happy. - Yeah, you're getting something, too. - An ipad! Thanks, grandpa! I know that feeling. It's like when I buy a new car. This is the life. Hey... It isn't shoveled in front of Ove's house. - Who cares. - But it's 8:00. It's time for his rounds. Ove! Don't be worried that I did something stupid. If you're reading this, the doctor's diagnosis was right. She said my heart was too big. But even if that sounds nice, it's not so good. Sooner or later, one pays for it. I wish for the funeral to be in a church as it should be. No fuss with ashes spread in the wind or any of that nonsense. I want it done quietly, with only those closest to me - - who think that I've done right by me. The cat eats tuna twice a day, and doesn't want shit in other people's houses. Respect that. And for fuck's sake, don't let any fucking cars in the association. English subtitles by S.E. kyckling@protonmail. com
