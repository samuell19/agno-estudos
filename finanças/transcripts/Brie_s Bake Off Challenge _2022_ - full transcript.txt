When are they gonna come? Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up! Can't believe we're running late. Why didn't you wake me? I did wake you up. You just went back to sleep. You should've woken me up again! You should be able to wake yourself up. I'm eight! I was up baking all last night- Kids, stop arguing. Brie, get in the car. Hurry up. Buckle your seatbelt. ♪ Been broke and beaten down ♪ ♪ Tasted dirt as I hit the ground ♪ You look awfully spiffy today. It's show and tell day. Booger face. Poop head! Hey, I don't wanna hear it today. ♪ How far you gonna go ♪ Wait, Dad! I left my phone at the house. Go back. We're already running late, sweetie. But, Dad! What do you need a phone for? You'll be in school. I don't wanna be late for school. I wasn't talking to you. Don't talk to your brother like that. Can you please calm down? Fine. Apologize to your brother. Sorry for yelling at you even though you deserved it. You call that an apology? Brie. Sorry. Okay. There we go. Now it's a subpar morning again. ♪ Live like a drop of rain ♪ ♪ Love like a hurricane ♪ Good morning, Cardinals! Don't forge we'll have an early dismissal today for our bake sale. I hope you all brought your bakes. Winners will get to compete in our annual Spring Bake Off Challenge. So please cheer your fellow students on! You still asleep over there? No, I'm just a little nervous. You got this. Remember what I told you? Yeah. You'll be fine. Okay. Now go get 'em. Thank you. All right, have a great day. And sell those bakes! Thank you. Ew. Do you really think those bakes will sell better than mine? Those look like poop. These happen to be the most amazing brownies ever. Not if they look like that. See mine? These taste as good as they look. Those look like you bought them from the store. I'm just good at baking and I'm going to sell the most today. Well I hope you didn't mistake sugar for salt. I hope you don't accidentally drop your bakes. You wouldn't. After you. Don't. Don't do it. Hey. Why were you talking to Vanessa? She thinks she's gonna win the bake sale. Did you tell her that it's your grandma's super secret recipe? No, she was too busy calling them poop. She doesn't know what she's talking about. I know. Where's your bakes? Ms. Melanie had us take some to the big fridge already. You might have to go too. Great. What? Vanessa said "I hope you don't accidentally" drop your bakes." Oops. Is everything all right, Millie? Yeah. You know, I just got a whiff of Brie's brownies and they took my breath away. So good. Brie, why don't you go to the cafeteria fridge where the rest of the bakes are? Yes, Ms. Melanie. Ms. Melanie, I need to put mine away too. All right, go ahead. Anyone else have bakes for the bake sale? Sorry. Wish me luck. Wishing your bakes a safe voyage. Oh, why Jody, those look fantastic. Why don't you go with the girls to the fridge? Hey, wait for him, girls. Hey, Jody, those look really good. Thanks. All right, everyone. Settle down. Take out your writing assignments and send them to the front. So, who taught you how to bake? My dad's a baker. That's so cool. My dad's lame. Why? What's he do? He's... He, uh... He's a doctor. Oh, he must be really busy. Very. Oh, shoot. I forgot my whipped cream in my backpack. I'll be right back. A doctor? Don't say anything, or else. I'm not really gonna drop your bakes. I'm gonna beat you fair and square. Yeah, well, we'll just have to see then, won't we? All right, let's go. Om. Om. Om. Namaste, everyone. Namaste. Now, in honor of today's bake sale, and because we have shorter classes, I thought it would be fun for each of us to draw our favorite desserts. Nice. Now, here's some paper to draw on. Pass those back. Now really think about the feeling you get when drawing out the details of your desserts. Okay? Splendid. I am not a cheese wheel! Brie, what on earth are you talking about? Nothing. What's on that piece of paper? Brie, show me what's on that paper. Who drew this? Brie? Millie? I don't know. Someone tell me who drew this or none of you will participate in the bake sale today. What? One last time. All right. I'll tell Ms. Melanie that each of you will be waiting in the cafeteria for your parents to come and get you. It was Vanessa. Is this true, Vanessa? Kind of. You know better than to gossip about other people, especially your classmates. You're going to the principal's office. And let this be a lesson to the rest of you. There will absolutely no name calling of any kind. In this classroom or out of it! You're such a tattle tale. Vanessa! The aura in here is completely tainted. Continue working on your drawings until the bell rings. I can't believe you just did that. Did you hear how quiet she was? I know, but to call her out in front of everybody? Mr. Claymore would've made us sit out on the bake sale. Yeah, but tell him in private like in a note or after class. Something else. Oh, yeah. I guess that would've been better. Oh my sweet tart. There's Vanessa. Do you think they'll still let her in the bake sale? I don't know. I hope not. Only nice people should be able to do it. Well, if she doesn't, then we're definitely winning those tickets to Cosmo Land. I don't know. Jody's pies smelled really good. Maybe she'll get detention for like the rest of her life. Yeah, right. Wait. Something's wrong with your pizza. What the? Ew. It's still frozen. Go ask for another one. BRB. I can't wait for the bake sale today! Vanessa's cupcakes look really pretty. I wanna try Jody's pies. Yeah, we'll see who wins. Patricia says she doesn't know what happened. Weird. So, I just got fruit instead. Well that's healthier since we've been eating a lot of sweets lately. Yeah, yeah. At least we get out early today. I love early dismissal days. I cannot wait to win this thing. Me too. Here we go. We got this. Millie, Vanessa's in. Sugar, we don't got this. All right, kids. Who's ready for the bake sale? Mm-mm-mm. Whoever hired him deserves a medal. Whoever made him deserves a medal. Agreed. This is your first bake sale? Yeah. We didn't do anything like this at my other school. Ms. Melanie, I'm a little concerned about the calorie consumption that's gonna take place here today. Oh, yes. Me too. It's an awful lot of sugar for such small children. Yeah. I think we're ready to start. Trying to get on his good side, I see? No, it's true. You were one of the first to yay the Bake Off, remember? Shh! I'm trying to listen. All right, kids. Who's ready to start the bake sale? That's the spirit I like to see. All right, a couple of reminders. One, try not to eat all your bakes at once, okay? We don't want you guys going home with severe stomach pains. And two, this is the big one, the top four contestants who sell the most bakes today will have the opportunity to compete in our annual Spring Bake Off Challenge. All right, and now I'm gonna hand it over to Ms. Melanie for some more exciting news. Thank you, Lester. Okay. The winner of this year's Spring Bake Off Challenge will win the usual, four tickets to Cosmo Land and, new this year, is $5,000 towards your college tuition thanks to our new corporate sponsor DCBX. Now DCBX is going to be providing our school with the necessary tools and technology to create more extracurricular activities such as these. $5,000? Oh my great jellybeans. Millie, that's enough to pay for my culinary school. Or a new computer for The Mighty Realm. They said it's for college tuition, not computer games. Oh, I guess it can go to that too. All right, children. Ready, set, sell those bakes! How much? How much do you think these delicious brownies are worth? They have a perfect crust and an ooey-gooey surprise in the middle. Hmm. Three tickets. Great! But would you like another brownie for just two more tickets? That's a great deal. I'll take it. Thank you! Thank you. Tell your friends. I thought you said just one ticket? I saw an opportunity and I took it. Dang, you're good. Plus my dad taught me all about upselling. Oh. What's that? Here you go. Thanks. Don't forget, ♪Vanessascupcakes, ♪ bakesale, ♪bakes, ♪ bestcupcakesever, ♪delicious. Got it. Social media. That's brilliant. Why didn't we think of that, Millie? I didn't know you could do that. Where's your phone? I left it at home. Where's yours? Mine's still broken. Oh, Millie, you have a customer. Oh, why, hello there. Hello. Would you like a cookie? Duh. How much is it? How much do you think this cookie is worth? It is baked to perfection and has ooey-gooey chocolate chips in the middle. Um, a ticket? Um, how about three tickets? That's too much. I said one ticket. Two tickets? How about I take my ticket elsewhere? For an extra ticket you could add chocolate on top. Okay, okay, okay. One ticket it is. Now that's more like it. Thank you very much. Come again. Whew, what a tough customer. You handled that well. Thanks. We would like more brownies, please. Great seeing you again. Can you give us a group discount? Um, I normally wouldn't do that but I'll make an exception. Instead of three tickets per brownie, how about two? Okay, we can do two. These are amazing. Thanks. Thank you. Pleasure doing business with you. Likewise. Okay, kids, bake sale is over. Bakers, please bring your pencil boxes over to Ms. Melanie's station right over here. Oh my God, this pie is so good. Mm-hmm. Who do you think is gonna win? Whoever made this pie. Ms. Henderson! Ms. Henderson. Hi, hi. Hi, did you get my text? No, I didn't get anything. Really? Oh. I sent it at 11:00 o'clock last night. Oh, well I was probably sleeping. Stuart did not understand the math homework last night. Mom! Okay, well yes we went over it today. Okay, well just so you know. Come on, dear. You need to change your number. I have, twice. Here you go. All right, everyone, we are ready to announce the winners of today's bake sale. In fourth place we have Jody selling 40 tickets. Fourth? Congrats, Jody. Happy you made the cut. My dad is not gonna be happy about this. In third place we have Millie Thompson selling 47 tickets. Good job, Millie. Way to go. Yes. In second place we have Brie Hayes selling 52 tickets. Second place? 52 is a lot. Good job, Brie. And in first place we have- Don't say Vanessa, don't say Vanessa. Vanessa Weiler selling 53 tickets! Yes! Wow, what a close race. We should get a recount. What? What did you just say? Oh, me? Um, nothing. You're gonna regret that. All right, today's bake sale helped raise $936 for the school. That's great. You four will compete in our annual Spring Bake Off Challenge for a chance to win four tickets to Cosmo Land and $5,000. All right, guys, let's clean it up. Why did I have to say that, Millie? Good question. I just wanted to win first place. I mean, you got second. That's still pretty good. Not when Vanessa wins first. The important thing is that we made final four. That was our goal. That means I'm only second as good. No, that just means Vanessa had a better marketing strategy. My grandma would not be proud. That's a terrible thing to say. I'm sure she was the sweetest lady. She was actually kinda mean. They all are. I'm so sorry, girls. Dad, it's 4:37! I know. I got distracted with a phone call. How'd the bake sale go? We got in! Yes! I told you girls. Why the face, Brie? I got second. That's great, sweetie. Millie, did you get first then? She got third. Vanessa got first. Vanessa Weiler? Yes, Dad. What other Vanessa is there? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Drop the tude, Brie. You should be happy you're in the Bake Off. All right? Come on. Let's get you guys home. Did your dad really just say tude? Yeah. Hurry up, ladies. Brie, wake up. You got drool on your face, toots. Millie, don't call her that. Brie, finish your homework. How can you concentrate? It's so boring. I don't know. I guess I just really like the story. Sweetie, you have got to cheer up. That's easy for you to say. You're a grown-up. Well if you focus on your homework, maybe you'll forget about what happened. Oh, can we make chocolate cake? I said focus on homework. Actually, can we, Dad? You wanna bake more? Yeah, like you say in your book, I need to vent out my feelings. Nice. Okay, if it'll make you feel better. Just make sure you finish your homework. Thanks, Dad, Thanks, Mr. H. Call me if you need anything. I'll mix the dry ingredients, you mix the wet. On it. Mm, cocoa powder smells so good. Here's the wet ingredients for your mix. I'll butter the pan. Holy pretzel sticks, Peter! You made us drop the mix! It's all over the floor! Dad! Are you okay? What's going on? What did you guys do? Us? Peter scared us and made us drop the mix. Our cake is ruined. Peter Ivan Hayes, get down here! So much for baking a cake. Peter, help your sister clean this up. Why did you do that? I thought it would be funny. Well, not today. You get 30 minutes of time out. 30? Mm-hmm. It should be an hour. Or three. Hundred. I'm watching you. After you girls clean this up you can bake another one while your brother is upstairs, all right? I don't know why we're helping to clean this up, but okay. Here's my phone. Do you think if you had your phone today you would've won the bake sale? Millie, I don't wanna think about that right meow. Sorry. Oh my goodness, this question doesn't make any sense. Yes! I wanna go check the cake! No, Peter! You stay. We don't want you messing up our chocolate masterpiece. Stay, Peter. Stay. Stay. Ah-ah! Sit! Good boy. Hey, Dad. The cakes are ready. Mm-hmm. Okay. Bye. All ready. Oh my goodness, they look so good. That looks good, girls. It rose perfectly. Hello! Jamie, kids! Can someone help me with the groceries, please? I'll be right there. Oh! Hi, sweetie. Hi, honey. Mommy! Hello, Peter! Let me help you with this. Thank you. Oh, I see you baked again. Yeah, but Peter scared us and made us drop it. So we made it again. Now, Peter, if you're gonna scare someone, at least make sure they're not holding something important. Got it. Okay, good. Marcy. What? I mean, Peter, don't you ever do anything like that again, okay? Okay. Okay. Now go get the groceries. Come on, buddy. So, I'm assuming you sold all your brownies today? No. No? What do you mean no? I got second place. Second? Oh. Well, at least you got in, right? Yeah, but Vanessa got first. Oh. Vanessa Weiler? Yeah. Well what did she make? Cupcakes. She used social media tactics to market her cupcakes. Oh, wow. Well why didn't you do that? I left my phone at home. And mine's still broken. Well did she say anything to you afterward? Uh, no. Oh, you got donuts. Yes, they were on sale. Where do these go? In that cabinet right there. So what place did you get, Millie? Third. Oh, the winners get more than just Cosmo Land tickets if they win this year. Oh yeah, what's that? $5,000. $5,000? Jamie, did you hear that? Yeah, I heard. Brie, how come you didn't tell me sooner? She was too bust moping. I was not! Uh-hmm. Was too. Well you two will have a fun opportunity to bake together. Who ate a donut? Peter! How many times do I have to tell you not before dinner? That boy never listens. Tell me about it. Dad? Dad? Hmm? I have some great news. I got first place in the bake sale today. I helped to raise a bunch of money and I get to compete in the Spring Bake Off Challenge for $5,000. That's great, sweetie. Yeah. The Bake Off is in like a month. So I have to practice some more. Who took you home today? Maxine's mom. Oh, good. Did you finish your homework? Yeah. Perfect. Are you serious? There was nothing else, huh? Go! Stay close. That chocolate cake tastes so good. Mm-hmm. I'm surprised you had room after having seconds and a donut. I couldn't help myself. Shh, guys! I'm trying to listen. Eight years old from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania with an IQ of 250 which is way higher than most Americans. I can't believe how much these kids are. Me neither. Millie, that is your mom. Why don't you get your stuff? You don't have to get up, honey. I'll get it. Oh. Thank you, sweetheart. You're welcome. Peace out. Thanks for dinner, Mrs. H. You're welcome. Have a nice night, Millie. See you tomorrow. Bye. Hey! Hi, Barb. Thanks for keeping Millie so late. Of course. I got caught up at the hospital. It's not a problem. They finished all their homework and they baked another cake today. Another cake? Mm-hmm. Okay. Thank you. What's up, Mamma? Congratulations, little star. Thanks, Mamma. I'm so proud of you for getting in. Hey, did you hear about the sponsorship? Yeah, Marcy told me on the phone. Yeah, $5,000. I know. Well, that is exciting. Well, we'll let you go. Of course. Thanks again. You're welcome. Thanks, Mr. H. All right. Have a good night. Take care. And remember, kids, be smart and keep on studying. This is your hostess with the mostest. My name is Leonard Moe. All right, you two. It's time for bed. And I will see you next time. Okay. All right, go brush your teeth. I'll be up in a minute. Okay. I'll do the dishes, honey. Thank you. Mm-hmm. You're being unusually sweet today. What's wrong? I haven't got my advance yet from Grant. What? I know. I've been on the phone with him all day. He said it's gonna be another couple of months. Another couple months? Doesn't he know we have a family to support? I told him. We're barley making ends meet on my salary. I know. I feel terrible. Maybe I should just go back to a full time. It's more secure. No. Don't do that. We'll dip into our savings and just put it back when you get it. I'm sorry, honey. I waited to tell you without the kids. No, I'm glad you waited. I just feel bad. You're the only one bringing home the bacon. Like both food and money. Honey, it's fine. We've been in worse places. I do wanna give Grant a piece of my mind though. I know. It's so frustrating. She leaves this thing everywhere. I just hope my book sells well. It will. It'll be all right, honey. Thank you, baby. Vanessa hasn't said anything to me today. What? Oh, I almost forgot she heard you wanting a recount. I think she forgot. I mean, she got first place. Yeah, maybe she'll forget all about it just like I did. Exactly. We good. Dip and dodge. Here we go, come on. Bop and weave. All right, here we go, guys. Dip and dodge. Dip and dodge. This doesn't look very good, Brie. I know, just keep dodging. Burn some calories. Yep. You call that a throw? Use your tricep. Get your shoulders into it. Come on. Mr. Lester said no head shots. Oops. Mr. Lester! You can do it, Brie. Grab a ball. Brie, what are you... Don't hide behind other kids, no. Use your instincts, come on. I'm sorry, Mr. Winters, but you signed the contract. The Montgomery Ballroom was never available on the 26th. Yes. As I told you before, another event has booked it. The other option is the Hartford Ballroom. It's similar in size but at the opposite end of the hotel. I understand that, sir, but... No. Yes. All right. Have a good day. Brie, you heard what the doctor said. It's just a small fracture. Mom, the Bake Off is next month. How am I supposed to practice? Brie, you are a wonderful baker. You have great instincts. Instinct is what got me here. What are you talking about? Mr. Lester told me to use my instincts in gym class and what do I do? I hide behind Jeremy thinking I would be safe. And what happened? I get squashed. I should've just taken a dodge ball to the face. To the face? Why would you take a dodge ball to the face? Um, that was just an expression. What did you mean by that? I... Well... Brie Alexandra Hayes, why would you take a dodge ball to the face? Vanessa was kind of attacking me and Millie with her friends. What? Brie, why didn't you tell me? I can't believe this is happening again. I should call the principle. No. I'm sure she didn't mean to hit Jeremy and have him fall on me and then break my arm. It just happened. Brie, it is not okay that she keeps targeting you. It's also not okay for you to stick up for her. Now I know you used to be best friends in Kindergarten before, well, you know. But this is just ridiculous. I should call her father. Mom, please stop! I'm handling it. Not if you come home with a broken arm, you aren't. I can't believe you never told me that Vanessa was there. Oh. Is that why Millie had a bruise on her forehead? Yep. Dodge ball right to the face. It was not pretty. But that's why I didn't tell you because I knew you would make a big deal out of it. Because it is a big deal. Now, Brie, as your mother, you are my responsibility and right now you're not safe in school. I've just gotta win the Bake Off, Mom. Then I can prove to her that she's not better than me. Please don't call her dad or the principal or anyone else. It's embarrassing and it's just gonna make things worse. You really don't want me to do anything? Just help me win the Bake Off, please. All right. If that's what you want. But, Brie, if Vanessa threatens you, if she makes fun of you or so far as puts a finger on you, you better tell me. You got that? Yes, Mom. Okay, good. Thanks, Mom. You're welcome. I am gonna push you really hard to win this thing. Good. This weekend, it's on. Can't wait. Ready, and mix! Come on, guys! Faster! You call that mixing? Let's see those spoons move! 30 seconds left. Ready, set, go. Yes! 16 seconds. 49 seconds. Fudge Popsicle sticks! Come on, ladies. Push yourselves. Hustle, hustle. You can do it, let's go! Why are we doing abs, Mrs. H? Don't question me, young lady. Yes, ma'am. Brie, why are we doing abs? I don't know. All right, ladies. That's enough for today. Tomorrow we practice taking cakes out of the oven without a timer. We're doing more tomorrow? I'm exhausted. Yes. You know I have to work all week. Ladies, we are three weeks away. It's time to hustle. I'm gonna hustle my way to the living room so I can relax. Come on, Millie. You're welcome. Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Mrs. H. Your mom's hardcore. Yeah, she's crazy. You did really good today. Not really. I'm still slow at everything. You just need to strengthen your good arm a little more. That's all. I don't think I should be in the Bake Off anymore. Don't say that, Brie. Millie, my arm is broken, I'm super slow, and you're doing better than me. You should just win it and take me to Cosmo Land with you. Doesn't your cast come off soon? Yeah. Maybe I should go. I'm sorry. I'm just not in a chipper mood right now. Okay. Can I borrow your phone? I'll call my mom. Yeah. Hi, Mom. Can you pick me up meow? We're done practicing. Yeah, we're done practicing. Okay. Okay. Okay, Mom. Love you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Okay, bye. She'll be here in 15. So, what did you end up painting for art class? What are you talking about? We have final paintings due on Monday. What? Yeah. Remember he said it when... You know what? You had your doctor's appointment that day. Millie, why didn't you remind me? I thought I told you. Remember on Friday Mr. Claymore was all like, "Don't forget finals are due on Monday." You were there. I don't remember that. You know what? You went to the bathroom. Completely missed it. What are the chances of that? How am I supposed to make a painting with a broken arm? You've been doing okay with your other arm. How am I supposed to make a painting in one day? I got it. Just make it abstract. You'll totally get an A. Once I went to an art museum and saw a painting of a line in a square worth millions. I still don't get it. I was with you that day. Oh, yeah. Wasn't it fun? Who are you? I was trying to draw bushes and then I gave up. So I drew some random stripes. It looks like Teletubbies. I think this is supposed to be grape juice. Lemons, orange juice, and strawberries. Wow. I see some very great pieces of artwork in front of me today. Vanessa, why don't you go first? I don't have mine today, Mr. Claymore. What happened? I, uh, left it at home. Okay. Well, that'll be minus five points for tardiness. Brie, how about you next? Come on, don't be shy. Um, so I did something a little different. When I thought about my happy place I thought of the park. So... Oh my. Brie! I'm sorry. No! You really went out of your way to express yourself here. Yeah, I did. Which arm did you use? Well, I started out with my broken arm but that didn't go so well. So mainly my left arm. Very good. I can really sense the struggle within yourself in this painting. Excellent work. A round of applause for Brie. Campbell, you're next. Okay, has everyone had a chance to present? There's the bell. Okay, excellent work today, everyone. Vanessa, can I see you for a moment? I got it. You sure? Mm-hmm, yeah. I'll see you in the cafeteria. Okay. Hey. What do you want? My mom almost called your dad today. Figures. He wouldn't have answered anyway. Well, I just wanted to say- I gotta go. I got the baked potato and sides today. No more frozen pizza for me. Yeah, that was pretty gross. Yeah. Did you talk to Vanessa? No, she just stormed off. Typical. At least you tried. Yeah. Are you gonna tell your mom? No. Ugh! What? It's as hard as a rock. Dude. You have got to start packing your own lunches. I know but my mom never has time in the morning. Can't you pack your own? Oh. I guess that's a better solution. So are you gonna get another potato? No, I'll just eat the sides. Here you go. Oh, thanks. So do you know what recipe you're gonna use for the Bake Off? I have no idea. Yeah, I think a few online. Ooh, what is it? I don't know if I should tell you. I'm not gonna copy you. Oh yeah, I know. I just don't think we should tell each other. But we're BFF's and we tell each other everything. Yeah, but we're kinda competing against each other, so. I was gonna tell you mine once I figured it out. I don't wanna know yours. Brie, do you even think you telling me is gonna change anything? I mean, it could. You could change yours after I tell you mine. Wow. You know what? You're right. We shouldn't talk about the recipes or the Bake Off. Or at all. Millie! Millie, I didn't mean to... Do you know where the donuts are? You ate them all, remember? Dang it. I thought I had one more left. What you baking now? A lavender vanilla cake. Are you gonna make me spill it again? No, not today. What's lavender? No chocolate? No, and it's a flower thingy. Oh. Can you put chocolate on it? I can but I won't. Why not? Because the recipe doesn't call for it! Okay, sheesh. What's up with you today? Nothing! Now go away. Bye. Leave, go. Hey, sweet pea. Hey, Dad. Wow, that looks good. Thank you. All done. Do you wanna try some? Uh, yeah. I'll have some. Peter, you want some cake? This is a new recipe I found online. Looks great. Yes! Oh, that looks so good. Oh, wow. Okay, for you. Thank you. All right, here we go, ready? Uno, dos, three. Hmm. That's um- Nasty. I don't like it. Maybe I added too much lavender? Yeah. Yeah. It's a little too- Gross. I was going to say floral. Maybe you should take out the lavender and add chocolate instead. But this recipe got so many good reviews. Maybe I messed it up somehow. Why don't you ask your mom? Oh yeah, she has a bunch, doesn't she? Yeah. And she'll be picking you up tomorrow for your doctor's appointment. I thought you were taking me. Yeah, I have a call I have to deal with now. Okay. Wait. You're getting out early tomorrow? Yep. I can't wait to get rid of this thing. Well your mom should be home soon. Okay. Here, let me help you clean this up. Give me that and that. All right. Get that outta here. Mom? Yeah, sweetie? Do you have any recipes I can use for the Bake Off? I'm sorry. What? Do you have any recipes I can use to practice with for the Bake Off? Oh yeah, of course. I completely forgot about those. I'm trying to think where I put them though. Is everything okay with work? Yes. I'm just finishing up a couple last minute things here. They should be in the kitchen. Let's go. Let's see. Oh, here they are. Whoa, these recipes are in cursive. Yeah, old school handwriting. I don't know how to write in cursive. Are you serious? They're not teaching you that in school? Nope. Well, just my name. Wow. Oh, here. This one's my favorite. Black forest gateo... Black forest gateaux. It has chocolate and cherries and... Oh, it is so good. Thank you. This one will definitely impress the judges. Thanks, Mom. Can we practice this tomorrow? Yeah, sure. That'll be perfect. You wanna invite Millie along to practice too? Um, we're not really talking right now. Sweetie, why? Because I wouldn't tell her what I was making for the Bake Off. Well that seems unfair of her and for the rest of the kids in the Bake Off. That's what I was thinking. Well did you tell her that? No, she just stormed off. Well, I'm sure she'll understand as soon as you talk to her. Yeah. This recipe looks really hard, Mom. I know you can do it. I hope so. Well, let's leave these here. It's getting late. And let's get ready for bed. Okay. Thanks, Mamma. Oh, you're welcome. 9:37? Dad! Mom! Dad! Why didn't you wake me? I'm gonna be late for school! Sweetie, everything is fine. You don't have school today. What? How come? Well, there was a fire in your school last night. A fire? What happened? Did anyone get hurt? Thankfully nobody got hurt. But apparently the ovens never fully shut off like they were supposed to and, well, exploded in the kitchen. Exploded? Luckily the kitchen has metal doors so the fire was somewhat contained. I read the rest of the cafeteria is fine. What? Oh my gosh. Dad, is there still gonna be a Bake Off? Sweetie, everything will be fine. They're probably figuring that out right now. What are we gonna do? Why aren't we in the faculty lounge? Because the aura in here is much better than in that hole. Okay. It does smell really good in here. Thank you, Lester. That's my calm mind and confidence boost essential oils. You know it's really good for muscle tension too. You know, I've heard of those but I'm not sure I could find a diffuser big enough for the entire gym. I could help you look for one in stores. That store Big Buys might have something. Oh, don't be silly, Lester. You can borrow my essential oils. That way you can try them out. Okay, thanks, guys. Mm-hmm! All right, everyone. Let's try and focus here. Ms. Henderson, what did the fireman say the damage was? He said an estimated $20,000. What? Oh my Lanta. Ms. Silvera, did you see how much contingency we have in our budget? Yes, we ran out of contingency two months ago. How is that possible? The bathroom leak on the third floor really took a hit to our budget this year. Well, what about DCBX? They're the ones sponsoring the Bake Off prize money. Why not ask them for help with the kitchen? Well, I'm afraid even if they did help, the kitchen would not be done before next week. The parents are gonna have a fit if we don't have this Bake Off. Well, I know. I'm not... No. What if we have it in the summer? Oh wait, I got it! Why don't we just do a no bake Bake Off Challenge. Hmm. Bake, no bake Bake Off. I guess that could work. I mean, it can. I make no bake bakes all the time. What? You bake too? Yeah, on my days off with my nieces. Wow. That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard. Lester, I think you just saved the Bake Off Challenge. I think I'm in love with this new plan. Yeah, me too. What do we do next? Well, we'll announce it first thing tomorrow morning. In the meantime, let's figure out what changes we have to make. All right. Oh, you're getting some paper. Oh, Lester, you didn't come prepared. There you go. Thank you. Hey! You got your cast off. Yeah. Where do you think you're going? To class. Your arm looks so much better. Yeah. Can't wait to play dodge ball with you again. Maybe we'll get your other arm. Hey! Come on, let's go. I'm so mad about the fire. All right, everyone. Settle down, settle down. I have some news this morning to pass onto you. As you all know, we had a bit of a fire in the cafeteria kitchen a couple of nights ago. Luckily, the damage was contained. However, our ovens for the Bake Off are completely destroyed. So, who are my contestants, please? Raise your hands. You four will now compete in a No Bake Bake Off Challenge. Like last year, the first two challenges will be a surprise and you'll have 15 minutes to complete it. As for the third and final challenge, unlike last year, instead of you baking a cake for the ultimate showdown, you will now be making an Ultimate Spring No Bake Cheesecake, all right? Don't forget next Friday we will have early dismissal. Now any students who are not participating in the Bake Off please be sure to be there to cheer your peers on. Does anybody have any questions? Oh, Vanessa. We're still having it in the cafeteria, right? Yes. And in the meantime, we'll be having our lunches here in the classroom. Okay. All right, now if everyone will open their book to page 133, we'll read the poem "A Chance I Have" by Kate Miller. All right, go ahead. Yes, Ms. Melanie. "A Chance I Have" by Kate Miller. Chances come and go. Some we take, some we miss. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you mad at me. No, I'm sorry. I was being a ding-dong. Well now I really don't know what to do. A No Bake Bake Off? I know, right? Well, don't tell me. I don't wanna know. And the chance I have each and every day. A chance I often miss and a chance I often run from. Brie, next verse. And the chance I have is the chance I have that makes life worth taking another breath. Millie, next verse. Get some rest, sweet pea. You're gonna do great tomorrow, honey. We got all the ingredients for the cheesecake, right, Mom? Yes, I checked five times. Okay. How's your arm doing? It's a little stiff but it's so, so much better. Well no matter what happens tomorrow, we're proud of you. Thanks, Dad. Goodnight. Goodnight, baby. Goodnight, sweetie. Goodnight, Mamma. Dad! You're home so late. I know. Crazy day today. I still need to go to the grocery store. We'll go tomorrow. Dad, I can't tomorrow. Hello? The Bake Off. That's tomorrow? Yeah, I told you like 100 times. Hey, don't take that tone with me, young lady. Did you forget? No. Can we please just go now? All right. Let's go. Wow. There are a lot of people here. Oh hey, there's Barb. Hey, Barb, come here. We saved you a seat. Okay, great. I don't believe we've met. I'm Jamie. Hi, I'm Don Fisher. Nice to meet you. Samantha. How are you doing, Samantha? Who are you all rooting for today? Oh, we're rooting for Jody. He's the only boy in the contest this year. Oh, nice, nice. Jody? Isn't that a girl's name? Jody is short for Joseph. Kinda like Jamie. Right, right. Marcy, meet Jody's parents. Oh, hi. Marcy Hayes. Hi, Samantha. Our daughter is Brie. That's wonderful. Jody has been practicing nonstop. Right, right. Have you seen Eugene? Who? Vanessa's dad. Oh, oh. No. Are you gonna say something to him? No. But he should be here. All the other parents are. I know. Hello, Ms. Melanie. Oh, hello, Daniel. How are you? So good to see you. I see you brought the big prize. Yes, of course. This must be your wife, Betty. Hi, so nice to meet you. Thank you for having us. The pleasure's all mine. Your seats are reserved in the front. Thank you. Hello, everyone. We will now get started. The winner of the Spring No Bake Bake Off Challenge will receive four tickets to Cosmo Land and $5,000 thanks to the wonderful Daniel and Betty Kauffman over at DCBX. I will now introduce the bakers. First up we have Jody Fisher. Look at that face. Beautiful. Next we have Brie Hayes. Brie, Brie, Brie, Brie, Brie, Brie, Brie! Millie Thompson. That's my baby! Woo! Hi, Mom. And lastly, Vanessa Weiler. All right, I will now move on to the judges. First up we have Mr. Claymore. Ms. Silvera. And Ms. Henderson. They will be judging the contestants on presentation, creativity, and of course taste. All right, the game plan. Just take care of her, okay? There will be three No Bake, Bake Off Challenges. For the first two rounds the bakers will have 15 minutes to complete the challenge. For the third and final round, they will have 45 minutes. I, Lester, will be tracking the time. Once I say time, bakers, hands off your bakes. Got that? Let the challenge begin! Get the table. Get the table. Okay. Contestants, please step forward with your baskets. Your first challenge is the No Bake Rice Crispy Treat Spectacular. Now you may only use these ingredients here at the table. Lester, the time. Ready, set, bake! Yeah, Brie! You got this, Jody. This is so exciting. Where is he? Five minutes left, bakers. 20 seconds left. Remember, presentation is important. Five, four, three, two, one. And that's time. Hands off your bakes. That was crazy. I can't wait to see what happens here. You know, we should really get two of these next time. I agree. Contestants, please step forward with your bakes to the judging table. I'm just gonna write yaas. Millie did great with the sprinkles, and the jelly beans are a nice touch too over here. I wonder how they're gonna- I don't know. It's really intense. Oh my goodness. What a wonderful suspenseful first round. We will now take a 15 minute break to set up for the next round. Thank you. Hi, Jody. Hello. That looked amazing. It really did. It was like incredible. Where did you learn to bake that good? My dad's a baker. Wow. That's so cool. Thanks. The way you stirred the batter with your wrist was perfect. The technique is on point. It was. Thank you. You did great, Millie bear. So proud of you! Thanks, Mamma. You did so great, honey. Thanks, Mom. That was intense. Yeah. Can I have some of the stuff you made? Um, I'm pretty sure they're cleaning up right now. Dang it. Sorry. You gotta wait your turn, mister. Um, I'll be right back. Okay. Vanessa, are you okay? Go away, Brie. I'm sorry your dad isn't here. I just wanted to tell you that if you ever need anything you can count on me, even if you make my life miserable sometimes. Brie, I don't wanna talk to you. Now go away! You know what? Maybe if you weren't such a brat all of the time, your friends would be in here trying to help you. Instead, they're out there talking to Jody. You don't know what you're talking about. I'm just trying to help. I don't need your help. Now go away or I'll- You'll what? Call me names, embarrass me in front of everyone, break my arm? Oh wait, you've already done all those things. I don't even know why I try with you anymore. We will now start the second challenge. One of my favorite desserts growing up, this is my Auntie May's marvelous no bake banana pudding. You will have exactly 15 minutes to complete this challenge. Lester, are you ready? I was born for this. Yeah, you were. Ready, set, bake! Oh my gosh. There's a lot of mixing in this one. Focus, Brie. 15 minutes. Come on, Brie, hustle. Let's go, Jody. Mix it all together. This is a tough one. I know. I am so nervous. How much time is left? Three minutes, bakers. Three minutes. Oh no. Brie, Vanessa just left. Whatever. I hope she's okay. And that's five, four, three, two, one. Time! Hands up, bakers. It's getting hot in here, wow. Bakers, please bring your banana puddings up to the judging table. Yeah, I think that one looks the best. I mean, that one's missing cookies altogether. Oh yeah, that's Vanessa. We're still gonna have to deduct the points. I think she tried. Yeah, but I'm still gonna have to give her zero points for presentation. Mm-mm. Yes, Jody! Oh my god. That is the best pudding I've ever had. But we can't show them. Why am I not floating up in an angel cloud right now? This is amazing. This is so good. It is so good. Mm. Okay. Yep. Okay. You guys ready? How's your arm feeling? It hurts a bit. I can't believe she just walked out. Yeah, her dad isn't here. I know. Are you okay? Yeah. Where are your parents? I don't know where my dad is. What about your mom? I don't have one anymore. Oh my gosh, I am so sorry. I had no idea. It's fine. Vanessa. Dad! I'm so sorry, Vanessa. I tried leaving early but my boss wouldn't let me go. You missed like almost all of it. I know. But I'm here now. Please don't be mad. I thought you weren't gonna come at all. You're the worst dad ever. I can't tell you how hard it's been not having your mom around. I can't do everything myself. You're never home and you never care about anything I do. I hate you. Please understand, Vanessa. I'm so sorry. I just wanna go home. I already messed up in the second round. Sweetie, if your mother were here right now, she'd be so proud of you. I want to go home. Come on, Vanessa. Come on, Vanessa. You still have a chance. But I already messed up. So what? This last challenge is what matters most anyway. All right, children. It's time. Mr. Weiler. I haven't seen you in a while. Yes, apologies. Well, please have a seat. We're about to start. Come on. Thanks, Jody. Don't mention it. Bakers, this is your third and final challenge. You have your ingredients with you that you brought from home. You will have 45 minutes to create the Ultimate Spring No Bake Cheesecake. Okay, ready? Okay. Ready, set, bake! Go Vanessa! You got this, Jody! Go, Brie! Go, Millie! You got this, Jody. Yes, Jody! Push through, Brie. I'm trying. Yeah, she just broke her arm. Oh. ♪ Oh ♪ Oh my sweet jellybeans. Oh my gosh. This would be so much easier with an electric mixer. Brie, if you need to stop, stop. It's okay. Don't hurt yourself. I'm fine. How much time is left? Oh, right. 20 minutes left, bakers. Sugar! You okay, Millie? Yeah, I dropped my blueberries. Luckily I have more. Go, Millie bear! Three minutes, bakers. Three minutes. Look at Jody. I mean, he is just like so good at what he's doing. One minute left, bakers. I know! Woo-hoo! You're almost there. Go, Millie bear, go! Five, four, three, two, one. Time! Hands up, bakers. Good job, Brie. That's pretty close, guys. Woo! They all look really, really good. Bakers, you will now individually present your final bakes. Jody, we'll start with you. For the final challenge I made a salted caramel no bake cheesecake with graham cracker crust and a cream cheese filling. Thank you, Jody. You may now go back to your station. Next, Brie. I made a milk chocolate no bake cheesecake with crushed Oreo crust, chocolate cream cheese filling, and caramel swirls with whipped cream on top. Mm, chocolate! Thank you, Brie. You may go back to your station. Next, Millie. Hola. Today I made a vanilla no bake cheesecake with vanilla lemon cream cheese filling, topped with fresh strawberries and blueberries. Thank you, Millie. And, lastly, Vanessa. Today I made a strawberry no bake cheesecake with a graham cracker crust filled with a fresh strawberry filling. Thank you, Vanessa. Please go back to your station. I mean, come on, it's a cat. Who doesn't love a cat cake? That was very cute, right? Was that just whipped cream? That was a little lazy. I think I'm good. All right. Oh my god. Is it Oreo? Oreo is my favorite. Seriously good. Eat that. I'm going to. Oh my god. They put caramel on this one too. She did this, didn't she? Like OMG, right? That is the best dang cheesecake I've ever had. Pass me the cake. I mean the cat. Pass me the cat. Mmmm-mm. Hold on, I need another bite of this one. It's not half bad. It's kinda good. Does it look better than it tastes though? Probably, yeah. You gotta be careful for that. Is this the one she screwed up? I don't know. It just looks like a cat. Hey, at least there's some cheesecake. There's no sugar. I actually like that. It's not as rich. Exactly. This is like a diabetic cake. Like this is what my grandma eats. This one's very fruity. It's good, it's good. This is Vanessa's. I think I'm good guys. I've got mine up. I just need to try this one more time because it's plain. I need to cleanse my palette. You go ahead. Come on, Brie. Are we ready? The winner of this year's Spring No Bake, Bake Off Challenge and the winner of four Cosmo Land tickets and $5,000 is Brie Hayes! No way! Yes! Congratulations! Are you serious? She doesn't even believe it. Go Brie! Go, Brie! Go, baby! Go, baby! I knew it! I told you, I told you! Let's go, let's go. Hey! I am so proud of you. That's our girl. I'm pretty sure you can go get some chocolate cheesecake now. Yes! How's your arm feeling? It's good. That's good. It doesn't hurt very much. Yeah? I am so proud of you. I knew you could do it. It was all those trials, Brie. I told you they were gonna work. You did so good. You did so good, I'm so proud of you. My heart was beating way above average. What a great Bake Off. It was, it was. But how did I do? Oh, you did a fantastic job announcing. Why, thank you. You did a great job judging. Oh, thank you. Oh, honey! I'm so proud of you. Thank you, love. Andrew, this is my wife, Sophia. Hi. Of course it is. Oh, wait, Andrew. You gave Lester the essential oils, right? I absolutely love them. Yes, yes I did. Great meeting you. Yeah, you too. Excuse me. It's okay. You're a strong independent man. Yes. Now I just need something to fill my heart. Cheesecake. And a glass of wine. Excuse me, guys. Hey, Sophia. Hey. It's so nice to see you again. Oh, nice to see you too. How are you? How's everything? It's good. How's the business? Oh, it's fantastic. It's great. Good, you did such a good job today. I forgot you two know each other. Thank you. You did great, Millie bear. Thanks, Mom. I'm so proud of you. How should we celebrate? Hmm. Cheesecake. Okay! Let's do it. Son, we practiced this 100 times. You must've measured the vanilla extract wrong. Sorry, Dad. Hon, don't be so hard on him. He did great. You did great, Jody. Thanks, Mom. You did great. Mom would've been so proud of you. Your cheesecake looks amazing. Thanks, Dad. Mm, smells like chocolate. Thank you. Whoever made this did a real good job. Which one? That one. Can I sit with you? No, but you probably will anyway. I'm sorry for everything I did to you, Brie. You think a sorry will unbreak my arm? No. I never meant that to happen. You never even said sorry when it did happen. Because I didn't think you wanted to talk to me. Well, I just wanted to tell you that I never meant to not be there when your mom died. Yeah, I know. Do you really? Yeah. I was just mean to you when we were younger so you wouldn't come over anymore. Why? Because my mom loved having you over and you got all the attention when you were there. So I started being mean to you so that we wouldn't be friends and then, well, you know. Well, I'm sorry for everything too. I know. Vanessa, can I talk to you for a sec? Uh, yeah. Sorry I lied to you about my dad. He's not really a doctor. Oh, no. I wanted to see if you would like to eat dinner with me tonight. Really? Yeah, I mean, my parents would be there but they can sit at another table. That's awesome. Do you think my dad could come too? He needs more company these days. Yeah, of course. You wanna go inside now, Brie? I'll wait for my dad. You guys go ahead. Okay, see you in there. Don't tell me any bad news, Grant. Mm-hmm. Yeah. You didn't? Yes! Thank you! Finally! All right. Okay, I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. Looks like you're not the only one getting a big fat check. They tripled my advance, more stores want my book.
