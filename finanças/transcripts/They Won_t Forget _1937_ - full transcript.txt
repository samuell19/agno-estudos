It's time to get up. The parade will be starting soon. They'll be waiting for us. - That's right. The parade. I was dreaming. Dreaming about the time we were in Chatanoogi. Remember? A funny thing. I was just dreaming about it myself. No time to dream now. Today we march. March. There ain't many of us left to march. Only six. Two more than them darned Yankees. Maybe next year. There will be five. Or four. Or three. Or maybe none. Maybe. Then .. they'll forget. They won't forget. They won't never forget. If they do we'll get up out of our graves and remind them. On your feet now. Come on. And look sharp. The whole town is watching us today. This is the one day out of the year that belongs to us. On consulting our files. We find that your letter was received. On June the 11th. The order slip is marked: "filled and forwarded". On June 17th. I have given personal instructions. That a duplicate set. Be sent you today by express. If, through any mischance. That word would be written above the line and not below, Miss Clay. I guess I just can't ever get it right, Mr Hale. Here. I'll show you. There. And next time, remember that. - Thank you awfully, Mr Hale. I will. If, through any mischance. This should not reach you by July the 5th will you please .. Dismiss the class. I said, dismiss the class. Why sir, may I ask? You may not know it, Mr Hale. But this is Memorial Day. Memorial Day? Yes, sir. For the Confederate dead. In my part of the country we call it Decoration Day. It comes a month later. In your part of the country you can call it whatever you and the Yankees please. But down here, it is Memorial Day. At the Buxton Business College, sir. It is a half-holiday. It is quite evident that Mr Hale. Is badly in need of some instruction himself. Class dismissed. Oh, hush up. Aren't you ever going to stop? I can't help it. Every time I think of the look on Mr Hale's face. When Buxton told us he needed a little instruction himself. I just bust right out all over again. Him so high and mighty all the time. I guess that took him down a peg or two. Well I still don't think it was funny. That old goat Buxton could have told it to him privately. I suppose you feel sorry for him? - Yes, I do. Well, maybe I'd feel that way too if I was stuck on him. You're just saying that because he never pays no mind to you. You are jealous. Not half as jealous as Joe would be if he knew of it. What you think he'd say? He'd say the same think I'm saying right now. You mind your own business. What will it be, ladies? Soda and cherry, Fred. How about you, half-pint? Make mine a chocolate malt and drop an egg in it as fresh as you are. The hens don't lay them that good. We're in a hurry, Fred. - So am I. I'm off at 2 o'clock if you'd like to see the parade. That's mighty sweet of you but I am dated up. Still mad? You know I can't stay mad at anybody very long. Besides, it is true. I am kinda stuck on him. He's awful handsome. You got kind-of a sweet tooth for him yourself. Yeah, I guess I have. But it don't do me any good. Lots of times I've sat there waiting and hoping that he'd stop by my desk. Like he does by yours. Then maybe him and me could have a romance. You know, like in those love-story magazines where a teacher meets a pupil. But nothing ever happens. He just walks right on by. And I go right on reading love-story magazines. Oh well, I guess that's life. Yes. I guess it is. That'll be 20 cents, half-pint. The name is Mary Clay. And I haven't got 20 cents. What's the matter? I left my vanity at school. I wonder if I could pick it up for before my date. It's 1:45. - What time you meet Joe? At 2. At the bench right near the statue of General Lee. You run ahead. I'll pay for the drinks. Thanks. Say, that's a sweet bit of hip. Thanks. If you hadn't been so stubborn we'd have been a-riding. We'll walk. The same as we did when we carried drums round our necks. Yeah, and had better wind. You said it, sir. Yes, you said it. Proud of me, aren't you. - I have always been. These same cheers are liable to turn into jeers someday. Never. Why, they love you too much. You are one of them. We shall see. The day we will see is the day Governor Mountford becomes Senator Mountford. You mustn't say that too loud. Andy Griffin is in the car behind. Andy Griffin doesn't count. In politics my dear, everybody counts. They applaud much louder for the governor. Ah, that doesn't mean a thing. - Yes, it does. Applause means votes. They'll applaud plenty after you make the speech about the road taxes. They will applaud him more. Well, you got to expect that. Remember, his name is Mountford. His father was a judge and his grandfather a general. The name has been in the public eye for three generations. It's part of the south. Your name is Griffin. They don't even know where you came from. It takes time to build a name. You got to wait. I don't like to wait. No, sir. I don't need family prestige to get me places. I need just one break. Something to make people forget in a few days what it took him 40 years to build. Just one. Something big. Something that will put me right up on top. Something spectacular. Hi, Professor Buxton. Well. What brings you back here, my dear child? I forgot my vanity. And I don't feel dressed without my lipstick. [ Buzzer ] [ Buzzer ] [ Footstep sounds ] [ Footstep sounds ] If you all likes walking better. It's okay with me. [ Footstep sounds ] And may we pray once more. That the prejudices and hatreds. Lie buried under this hallowed ground. Never again to be resurrected. In the cause of death and destruction. Amen. Governor. Let me congratulate you on your address. You made the past seem so vivid I almost felt you were part of it. Thank you, Mr Griffin. The more I see of my contemporaries. The more preferable the past becomes to the present. What are you all looking for? - One of the girls in the school. There ain't no girls here. They's all gone home. I'll just make sure of that. What seems to be the trouble? He's hunting for one of the girls in the school. Why young man, you ought to know this is Memorial Day. The school is closed. It's a half-holiday. I know that without you telling me. I'm only trying to help you. That's all. - When I need help I'll ask for it. I'll fix her. I'll fix her for standing me up. Good day, Tump. Good evening, Mr Hale. Is Mrs Hale home, son? - Yes, sir. Thanks. [ Radio: ] "And so while the entire South enjoyed a peaceful, sunny Memorial Day .." "In New York it was frost and Chicago was torn by a storm." They even brag about the weather. Hello, darling. - Hello, sweet. Oh, something smells funny. Maybe it's gas? No. It's perfume. Cheap perfume and it is coming from you. Ah, that's my hair. It does smell, doesn't it. I guess I fell asleep in the chair and the barber took advantage of me. Asleep? He must have given you gas if you couldn't smell all that. What's the matter? - Nothing. You look worried. It's nothing. Have a hard day? No. As a matter of fact I had a half day off on account of the holiday. You should have said. We could have spent the afternoon together. I didn't know it myself until this afternoon when Buxton walked in .. And balled me out in front of all my pupils. For my ignorance of southern traditions. To make matters worse he said to the class and in a holier-than-thou voice .. "It is evident that Mr Hale is sadly in need of some instruction his self." The girls of course laughed. You know what girls of that age are like. They laugh at everything. You mustn't take it so seriously. Why shouldn't I take is seriously? It's my livelihood, isn't it? Situations like that only make it harder for me to get the respect of my pupils. What did you do after you left the school? What? Oh, this afternoon? I stayed for a while to correct some examination papers. And then I wandered around and watched the parade. Did you? I did too. Wasn't it thrilling? All those old veterans marching. The music. Old tunes that you heard when you were very young. I hummed them all the way home. It sort-of made you feel like a history book had suddenly come to life again. I cheered so loud you would think I was a born Southerner. Sybil. Let's go away. Go away? Where? Up north where we came from. Why? I don't think I'll ever really make a go of it here. You haven't stayed long enough to find out. I've stayed long enough to find out it isn't what I thought it would be like. There seems to be some sort of barrier between me and the local people here. A barrier that grows bigger and bigger every day. Maybe you are creating it yourself. Maybe. I don't know. For the first time in a long time we've saved some money. Yeah. Two hundred dollars for six months work. You call that money? Well, it's better than nothing. It's better than living in that cold flat in New York. Wondering one day what is going to happen the next. Robert, at least we've left all that behind. You've gone through a lot with me, haven't you. I don't care. I'd go through it all again if I had to. But let's give ourselves a chance here. Let's stay here for a while. We'll make friends. And you'll be happy. I'll make you happy. And you can go right on .. right on answering Ads like you did before. If anything happens, why .. We can go back like you planned. And if nothing happens .. And if nothing happens? Well, just being with you is enough for me. No matter what happens. Why, there is a spot on your coat. That's a fine thing to talk about when I'm making love to you. Well, there is a spot on your coat. Hmm. The barber must have cut me. Better? Well? No. There is no spot on your dress. But? I think I'll kiss you anyway. I'd say it's the biggest parade we've had since the armistice. The most people. Yeah, but the least excitement. Nobody hurt, no fights, no nothing. I had to rack my brain to think of something to write about. Bill Brock made it exciting. Here, listen to his story. I've read it twice. "Crown goes wild with excitement. By William B. Brock." In person. A good story, Brock. It ought to be. I've been writing it for years. I wish something would happen in this jerk town that would give me a chance .. To show you birds what a swell story I can turn out. If I had the material. If that's all that's holding you back .. Why not commit suicide and write your own obituary? That ought to make a good story. I would my good friend and fellow worker only I don't want to scoop you again. You couldn't scoop me with a shovel and a yard full of sand. It seems to me you're getting a little tired. What's new, Sarge? - Not a thing. That's what I told my boss. Boss, I said: don't send me out tonight. Nothing will happen in this town. But he insisted so .. Here I am. And here I go. Stick around, Brock. You never can tell. Something may break. So what? Whatever it is I've got a story already written to fit it. Here you are, boys. The forecast of what happens for the next 24 hours. In this town after a parade. It never fails. "Veteran scolds his feet soaking his bunions." "Mrs Jones has another fight with her husband." "Police make arrest." "Man parks his car near a hydrant." "Police make arrest." "A penny crap game on Main Street." "Police make arrest." "And keep the pennies." You ought to show a little more respect for the Police Department, Brock. Respect? I haven't even got any for myself. Well .. so long, boys. Wait. I'll go with you, Brock. Not tonight, baby. I've got a date. With a dream. A date with a dream. I think I'll follow him. He shouldn't be walking around the streets like that. Well, of all the .. Hey, Look at him out here. What's it all about? - Come on and look at this man. Look. Look there. Hey, Brock. Don't you think you could find a better place to sleep in than a police car? No. Can you? A date with a dream. Give me the police. Give me the police. Give me the police. Give me the police. Give me. Hey Brock, wake up. - What's up? There's somebody killed in the Buxton building. What? Who? - I don't know. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. Shut up. We'll find out about that. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. - Shush. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. You hit her? - No. You killed her! And you'll burn for it! I didn't do it. I tell you I didn't do it. I said to you I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. Just like a doll she was. I said to Hazel the first time I seen her .. Ain't she just about the prettiest little thing. Just like a doll, ain't she Hazel? - And sweet too. The sweetest little thing I ever saw. It just beats me how anybody could kill her. It's awful ain't it. Imagine somebody you know sitting in the same class with you every day. And killed right there in college. - Yeah, awful. I'll take charge of this investigation. Well. How about the negro Redwine? He's sticking to the same story. - Did you check it? No. - Why not? Don't figure it's necessary. Give me one more hour with him and I'll have a confession. There will be no rough stuff. You do things your way. We'll do them ours. - Oh no you won't. Not this time. This isn't a petty larceny case that nobody cares about. It's important. A girl has been murdered. A young girl. There are a lot of people in this town that have daughters that age. They want a conviction. I'm going to give them one. And when I do, it is going to be the guilty party. You talk big. And loud. Loud enough so people know why the last two murders in this town stay unsolved. Or would you rather have me keep what I know to myself? The Clay boys are here. - Show them in. You wait outside. The other door. Which one is Luther Clay? I am. And this is Shattuck. And the other is Ransom Scott Clay? That is right. Sit down, boys. What we got to say we can say standing up. Boys, you were asked here because I need your help. Now listen. - You listen to us. That janitor Redwine .. - Just a minute, boys. Before you go flying off the handle. So far, we haven't got a thing on him. But I'll give you my word. If he is the man that killed your sister. I'll send him to the electric chair as sure as my name is Andy Griffin. You had better. I want you to answer a few questions about your sister. Her age. Her history. Her habits. Her friends. Her enemies. I've got to know everything. Everything. There is just this much to tell, mister. Us Clays ain't never had much. Excepting her. Like a flower she was. To all of us. Ever since she was that high. It was nice to come home at night from the mill. And hear the laugh of her. And see her smiling. But now we don't. No more. She is dead. There ain't nothing to come home to but the cussing of the old man. And the heart-breaking wailing of my mother. That is everything. I'm sorry. Sorry? Being sorry won't bring her back. Standing here talking gets us no place. Take it easy, Luther. - I'll speak my piece. Now look here, mister. You say you are not sure about this janitor. Maybe you are right and maybe you are not. But I say you'd better find out quick. Because if you don't. Law or no law. I'll kill him, I tell you. - Hush, Luther. Hush. We can't get nowhere like that. We don't even know if he done it yet. And if he did. He won't get away. Tucker. I want you to bring in Joseph Turner, an apprentice at the Monarch Steel Company. Here is his home address. He'll be a kid about twenty. Brown hair, blue eyes. He is Mary Clay's boyfriend. Or one of them. Bring him to me at the Buxton building. Laneart, you go out to my car. I'll be there in a minute. I'll need you for several hours. Look here, Andy. Won't you be acting too hasty if you let Redwine go? I'm not letting him go. Just yet. And even if I do. Bosh. Any fool can ride to glory on a helpless negro janitor. I am out for bigger game. Look out of the window, Harmon. That tells its own story, doesn't it? Those people want the man that murdered Mary Clay put on trial and convicted. They are going to think a lot of the man that gets that conviction. That man Harmon, is going to be me. Remember what I told you the day of the parade? That I needed just one break to set me on top. Unless I missed my guess, this is it. I am going to solve this case or bust trying. Come on, Harmon. We're going to the Buxton building. Buxton just passed through, chief. That is all you can tell us about the girl, Mr Buxton? That is all I know. I see. Gentlemen. Believe me. I would rather cut off my right arm. Than have had this dreadful tragedy happen. Why, for three generations. The family name of Buxton has been untouched by the breath of scandal. And my graduates occupy some of the highest positions .. Of trust and honor in this community. Believe me, gentlemen. Here comes Turner, Colonel. Bring him in. I would like to go home now. I don't feel well. - Naturally. A thing like this is enough to upset you. Well, I must ask you to stay for a while until we have a chance to look around. You mean I am detained, sir? - Yes. If you'd like to put it that way. It is only for a few hours. I see, sir. Joe Turner. Yes, sir? You had a date with Mary Clay yesterday at two o'clock. That's right. - She didn't meet you. No. What did you do after that? Honest, Mr Griffin. I had nothing to .. - I asked you what you did after that. Well. I got a little burned up waiting, see. So I started up the steps figuring that maybe she was still in the school. The janitor came to the door. Mister, I didn't have nothing to do with it. Go ahead. Well, the janitor came to the door and he said the place was closed. He asked me what I wanted. I told him I was looking for one of the girls in the school. He said the girls is all gone. Well, that burned me up. I was just about to push past him and find out for myself. I wish to heaven I had. - Go ahead. This white fellow comes out. The janitor says: He's hunting for one of the girls. The white fellow says: School is closed. Nobody is here. So I .. I went off, found some of the boys and shot pool with them. That's all I did. Honest. You can ask them if you don't believe me. Do you remember the name of this while fellow? Well, I think he called him Mr Hale. Mr Griffin. He means Robert Perry Hale. One of the young professors in my Business College. What was he doing here after the school was closed? I don't know. Can I go, mister? Can I go? No. Not for a while. I want to check your story first. Take him down to my office. Keep him there until I get there. There's a few more questions I want to ask him. I told you the truth, mister. The whole truth. I wouldn't have no reason to lie. Mary Clay was my girl. I wouldn't have no reason. You ain't going to lock me up! Listen, you've got to believe me. I didn't have nothing to do with it. Where do you think you're going? - Buxton Business College. The college is closed. But I .. - No buts about it. The orders is that no-one gets through. And no-one gets through. On your way, mister. You go to this college, buddy? Not exactly. I teach here. A professor, huh? Yes, if it's any of your business. - Now, don't get sore. I'm a reporter on The Advocate. Did you know are Mary Clay? Mary Clay? Go on, tell him, professor. Sure, you knew her. I'm sorry. I am in a hurry. A nice sociable fellow, just full of information. He could have given you a civil answer. He didn't need to be so snippy. Especially when she was so crazy about him. Crazy? About who? Mary Clay. She was in his class and was she crazy about Professor Hale. Crazy about Hale, huh? And how. Then what happened? Well, the minute I'm in there they start trying to push me around. But that don't go far with Joey Turner. Not by a long shot. I says to this dick, look here. You ain't going to spring nothing on me. And I ain't saying a thing either. Except to the D.A. - Weren't you scared? Scared. Scared? What had I to be scared about? I didn't have nothing to hide. - What happened then? Well, me and the D.A. gets to talking. A pretty nice guy the D.A. is when you get to know him. So I told him what I knew about the case. What did you tell him, Joe? I'm sorry, fellahs. That's strictly between me and the D.A. You're pretty famous ain't you, Joe. You got your picture in the paper and everything. Well, you got to remember, fellahs. I am a key witness. Give us the low-down, will you Joe? Did you really have a date with Mary? Say, I had a date with Mary every day. She was nuts about me she was. Was she? Hello, Shack. Was she? I loved her, Shack. Honest I did. Honest I did. And when I .. When I heard she was .. Well, I was like .. I loved her. You've got to believe me, Shack. You just got to believe me. I wouldn't like to you. Shack. I feel about this just like you do. I loved her, Shack. You got to believe me. I believe you, Joe. Thanks, Shack. I read in the papers you said you was going to get the guy that done it. Whoever he was. Yeah. I said it. Well. When the time comes. Remember that. I'll remember it. We all will, Shack. Won't we, fellahs? Don't forget it, boys. I'll thank you. Because we know. How it is going to end. No, Harmon. I don't believe it is either Buxton or Redwine or Turner. It is someone else. Someone who fits right in there. Plying tic-tac-toe? - How'd you get in? Your butler is on my payroll. I give him tips on the horses. Say, that's a nice halo you've given the kid. She won't wait long. Whose picture goes in there? Mister X. - You can tell me now. You'll get your information the same way the other boys do. No, I won't. I'll get it first. From you. - You waste my time. I'm busy. Too busy to listen to something that might .. Fill in that little circle for you? What do you know? - I asked first. Whose name you going to put in there? I told you: Mister X. You are up a tree, huh? For the present, yes. How about the janitor? - How about telling me what you know? First tell me about the janitor. I don't believe he did it. - The jury will. That is not enough. You mean, convicting him isn't important enough? It won't get you votes. - Here, Brock. I like the truth. Don't you? - You said you knew something. I'm not through yet. What about Buxton? - Purely circumstantial. A lot of cases have been won on that kind of evidence. This one won't be. Not with a man like Buxton. And in a town like this where family prestige counts for something. You still have a nice instinct for self-preservation. I don't see you jumping off any bridges. No, you don't. Well, do you know anything? Or are you wasting my time? As usual. We'll make a deal. If my tip pans out I get first crack at everything. It's a deal. There is a man named Hale. He teaches at the Business College. Hale? I had him investigated after Turner reported him. I've got a card on him. Get it out. Mary Clay was crazy about him. - Who told you this? One of her classmates, Imogene Mayfield. He was kind of stuck on her too. That might not mean a thing. - It might though. When you add it up with the fact that he was in the building when it happened. So long, Sherlock Holmes. When you need any more special detective work don't forget to call on me and .. Don't forget our deal. Well, what does it say? Not much. He came here 8 months ago from up north. He is married. About 27 years old. Lives at the Bedford Arms apartment. He has no children and no kinfolks down here. He is practically a stranger in town. A stranger, eh? And she was crazy about him. And he was in the building when it happened. Mister X. Maybe we will fill that space in. After all. Please wire reply. Signed: Robert Hale. Got that? - Every word of it. Here it is. "Can leave at once for position you mention. Stop." "Spring semester over. Stop." "Please wire reply. Robert Hale." Well? - Perfect. When you get to be a big executive will you let me by your secretary? I will not. You are doing much too good a job as my wife. That's for luck. The last time you kissed me like that you got fired. Last time doesn't count. Darling, I've a feeling that within a few days we'll be on our way to Chicago. Won't you have to give Buxton more notice than that? No. He won't miss me. And I certainly won't miss him or the school. Particularly since the murder of that girl. Oh, that was horrible, wasn't it. Did you know her? Yes. She was one of the pupils. What was she like? Was she pretty? Pretty? Yes, she was pretty. And about that janitor. Do you think .. Please. I'd rather not talk about it. I am sorry. I should have known better. I'm going to send this right off. - What about breakfast? I'll be right back. Telegraph office is only round the corner. You can send it by phone. And take a chance on the operator getting it wrong? Not this telegram. You can send it on your way to school. I can't wait that long. This is too important. Your hat then, darling. It is cool out. Sybil, cool in the south? I am surprised at you. I'll be right back. That is Mr Hale there. Yes. I am Mr Hale. What is it? Nothing much, Mr Hale. The District Attorney would just like to ask you a few questions about Mary Clay. Mary Clay? Yeah. The murdered girl that was one of your pupils. But I don't know anything about her. - Well, that's fine. Just tell that to the chief. You don't know nothing about the girl. Planning a little trip, Mr Hale? - You had no right to read that. No, of course not. - Come along. Mr Hale. I am sorry, Mr Hale. I couldn't get that spot out altogether. What spot? - On the coat. I reckon it was paint or blood or something. Well, that's alright. Just ask Mrs Hale to hang it up. We will take the suit along too. We'll hang it in our closet. On your way, boy. Come on, let's go. - Is it alright if I get my hat? It's alright if we go with you. My wife's in there. I mustn't frighten her. We'll still go with you. Just as you say. You are back so soon. Robert. - Sybil, listen. Who are these men? No need to be frightened, Sybil. They're detectives. Detectives? - Yes. I have to go to the District Attorney's office to be questioned. You see, they're questioning everyone who knew Mary Clay. Isn't that right, boys? That's right, lady. All we want to do is ask him a few questions. Oh. Nothing to worry about, darling. I'll be back soon. Yeah, there's nothing to worry about, lady. He'll be back soon. Alright. Come on, let's go. Don't worry. Robert. Robert! Robert. Robert! Nervous, aren't you, Mr Hale? No .. no. I'm not nervous. I've no reason to be. I hope not. And you're sure you have nothing more to say, Mr Hale? Nothing. Except that I am completely innocent. I had no more to do with Mary Clay's death than you did. That's all. Until I get a lawyer. It's your constitutional right, Mr Hale. - I know that. It is also my right to hold you for further questioning. Lock him up, boys. My wife. I must see her. I want to tell her. Sorry, Mr Hale. You can see no-one until I am through with you. Well, the least you could do is let me call her. Phone up his wife for him, boys. What is her number, Hale? Magnolia 6-3-2-1. Magnolia 6-3-2-1. Sorry, Hale. No answer. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Alright. Admitting all you got on him is circumstantial evidence. Supposing you could get a conviction on that? Would you prosecute? - Not unless I was sure. Of what? His guilt or a conviction? Look here, Brock. You came here to get a story. Here it is. I'm holding Hale for further questioning. That's all. Goodbye. Just a minute. Just a minute. There's something else you can add to that story. And that is, that politics or no politics. I'll prosecute no-one in this case. Until I am positively convinced of his guilt. Okay, Colonel. And I mean that, Harmon. Yes, sir. I am sure you do. Well, at least let me talk to him. Why can't I talk to him? He's there, isn't he? Isn't he? Tell him I .. Hello? Hello? Hello? [ Door knocks ] Here we are boys and girls. Mrs Hale in person. What do you want? A story. Pictures. A statement. - The woman's angle. Your home life. The press is a powerful influence for justice, Mrs Hale. Yes, ma'am. You give The Star a break and the The Star will give you a break. Look this way and smile, Mrs Hale. - When you and your husband .. My husband. What's happened to him? I must to know. - What's happened to him? Don't you know, honey? - No. All I know is they came for him this morning and he went away with them. For questioning, they said. And I haven't seen him since. Somebody has got to tell her. Your husband is in jail, honey. Jail? Well, what for? For suspicion of murdering Mary Clay. - Murder? Of Mary Clay? Murder? She's fainted. - Get it? I got it. Take care of her, Dolly. When she comes to, she'll want to talk. I'll look around. Yeah. We'll all look around. Here's a beaut. Honeymoon special. Yes, sir. Taken when love was young and perfume of orange blossoms filled the air. Poor kids. They were on their honeymoon. It wasn't taken so long ago. I'd feel kinda bad using this. Give it to me. I'd use it. That would make me feel worse. But they're only holding him on suspicion, honey. They haven't proven anything. There is nothing to worry about. Do you really think so? Of course. Dolly wouldn't kid you. Dolly knows just exactly how you feel. Now you perk up and tell Dolly everything. It will be better for you to talk your heart out. To a woman. You met him in New York didn't you, honey? Yes. We worked in the same office on Wall Street. I understand. Sort-of a white-collar courtship? I suppose he rushed you off your feet. No. No, Robert never was the aggressive sort. We just took bus rides. Went to Coney Island on summer excursion boats. In fact, that's where he proposed to me. You've been happy ever since haven't you, honey. Of course we've been happy. Never quarrelled? - Never. Not even a little quarrel in all your married life? That's remarkable, honey. Only once in a while. It was mostly about his wanting to go away. Oh. Yes. You see Robert could never get used to this place. He always had some kind of a feeling .. That people here in the South would never accept a northerner. That they were still fighting the civil war. Very silly, wasn't it. - Very silly. But you wouldn't print any of this would you? This is our own life. Our own private life. Don't you worry about that, honey. It looks like you got the right man this time, Andy. Maybe. Ain't no doubt about it if you believe what the papers say. The question is, can you prove? Listen. If there is any proving to be done .. Andy is the man to do it. Ain't you, Andy? Thanks. What burns me up is the things he has to say about the South. Why don't he go back north where he came from if he feels that way about it. I bet he'd like to go back any place right now. With the evidence you got on him .. I tell you Griff, there ain't a jury in the world that wouldn't find him guilty. There ain't no doubt about if you believe what the papers have to say. But again I say: can you prove? Prove? Put me on that jury. I got all the proof I need right now. And me. To me Andy, it looks like an open and shut case. I'll bet you get a conviction in no time at all. Excuse me, gentlemen. I'm in a hurry. And thank you. I'll lay 8-to-5 that if little Andy wins this case he'll wind up being governor. Harmon, I've finally made up my mind. The evidence points to only one conclusion. When we return to the office I want you to draw up an indictment against Hale. Yes, sir. Extra! Extra! Hale indicted! Reads about it. Extra! Extra! Hale indicted. Extra! Extra! Hale indicted! Read all about it. Hale indicted. But Mr Griffin. The things they've printed about us in the papers. I didn't say them. They are lies. But I'm not prosecuting him because of what I read in the papers. I am prosecuting him because I believe he is guilty. But he couldn't be. Not Robert. He couldn't. You've got to let him go. I wouldn't let my own father go in the face of these facts. Facts? What facts have you got except a lot of vicious lies the papers have spread? These, Mrs Hale. That he was in the building when the murder was committed. That he did like Mary Clay. That is not true. That there was blood on his coat. And that he did plan to run away. Well, at least you can let me see him. Sure. I'll let you see him. Here you are, Mrs Hale. Five minutes. It's so good to be together again. To be in your arms, to be able to talk to you. To kiss you. Even if it is only for a few minutes. A few minutes. Yes. That's all that is left. Soon, they'll even take that away from us. You mustn't talk like that. But they can't hold you here much longer. In a few days you'll be free. Oh, Sybil. What is the use of shutting your eyes to the truth. Dreams won't help. I'll never leave here alive. - Robert. I know it. I say I know it. I knew from the day they took me away with them. There's no chance for me. Not a chance. - But I tell you there is, Robert. It isn't that I'm afraid to die. No man is afraid to die, if in his death there is rhyme or reason. But here there is none. It is just stupid and senseless. You'll live, Robert. Why, they can't convict you. You are innocent. That won't make any difference to them. It will if we prove it. - How? We'll get lawyers. With what? The 200 dollars we've saved? I'll write to your mother. Maybe she can help. Yeah. She hasn't even enough for herself. Darling. Darling, please listen to me. You mustn't feel this way. For your sake, for mine. It isn't over. Somewhere. Some place there must be someone who'll help. Hello, little Andy. This is old Brocky. What do you think has happened? The war has started. What war? The civil war all over again. The New York Independent is hollering about southern prejudices. What are we doing? We're hollering about northern prejudices. It is getting to be some story, eh Andy? What's it got to do with you? Plenty, boy. Plenty. I just got this over the wire. They are sending Pindar down to investigate. Pindar. Head of Pindar's Private Detective Agency. The only man in the world who can find a needle in a haystack. So, if you've got anything to hide Andy, hide it now. Yes, sir. I've got nothing to hide, Brock. Absolutely nothing. From Pindar or anybody else. Goodbye. So Pindar is coming here, huh? We'll show that New York detective. You'll show him nothing but the utmost cooperation. He is to be free to look at every record in the case to talk to anyone he likes. How about the janitor? You going to let him talk to the janitor too? Sure. Let him talk to the janitor too. You heard what I said. I've got nothing to hide. From anyone. You are Mrs Hale? - Yes, and you are .. Are you, Pindar? Yes. That's my name. You're that detective they sent from up north. Yes. Why? We just want to get a look at you. That's all. You don't mind, do you? Come along, Mrs Hale. Do you think we ought to follow him? - No. Let him snoop around. It don't make no difference what he finds. We know how it is going to end. There he is, Mr Buxton. - Thank you. Wake up, boy. Morning, Tump. Tump. This is Colonel Foster. Your lawyer. Lawyer? - Yes. I ain't got no money to pay for no lawyer, Mr Buxton. I'm paying for it, Tump. You've been working for me a long time. I always take care of people that work for me. You know that, Tump. Still, I can't see why for I need a lawyer. I ain't done nothing. Nobody says you have, Tump. But they might. - Who might? A detective from up north coming down here. What for? - They're trying to get Hale free. But they might try to pin it on you. I ain't done nothing. Tricky fellows from up north. You have got to be careful what you say. What I say to him. Is the same thing I say to Mr Griffin. That is alright for Mr Griffin. He believes you are innocent. And so do we. But they don't. They are out to get you, Tump. Your story has got to be a better one than you have told up to now. If you don't want to get electrocuted. Electrocuted? - Yeah. They will put you on trial. They'll find you guilty. The judge will say: "Tump Redwine." "I sentence you to die in the electric chair." No, no. Don't do that to me. I had nothing to do with this. Maybe if Hale goes free. That crowd won't wait for no trial. They'll come and get you no matter how far you run or where you hide. And that will be worse. No, no. I ain't done nothing. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. - Now. Tump. You don't need to be scared. Not if you listen to me, you don't. Now see here, Tump. So far as I've been able to find out .. They're holding you on a lot of circumstantial facts .. That nine times out of ten would be thrown out of court. And mine happens to the tenth? - Well, I don't know. The most damaging thing against you is the public opinion that's been aroused. That sometimes sways a jury. Have you got a lawyer? - Yes. The court appointed one. What's he like? I don't think he was very anxious to take this case. I see. Well, don't worry about that. We'll get you one and a good one. What are we to do in the meantime? - Just sit tight. Don't antagonise anyone. Be very careful of every move you make. And every word you say. That isn't easy. Sometimes when they ask me questions. They look at me as I walk down the street. I want to .. I know, I know. But you can't. Remember the real trial is going on right now. Now. Let's go carefully, step by step. After you left the school. You went to this barber? - Yes. There you are, sir. That's a good shave. Nice and smooth. You are a pretty good barber. I ought to be. I've been at it long enough. Do you own the shop? For the last 25 years. Me and my wife. She runs a beauty parlor back there. I guess business ought to be picking up with this trial coming along. Well, it won't make much difference to me. See, I have a regular trade here. Of course, now and then someone drops in off the street like you, but not often. We don't see a strange face around here very often. That will be 35 cents, sir. There you are. - Thank you, sir. I bet when you do see a stranger you'll remember him. Mister, I never forget nothing. Names nor faces. You can ask anybody round here. They'll tell you that Jim Timberlake can remember things from a way .. Say. How come you're asking me all these here questions? Oh, just making conversation. Yeah? Well, that's a funny way of making conversation. Just who are you anyway? Pindar is his name, Jim. A detective from up north. He has his picture all over the paper. So, pretty tricky ain't you. No. Not tricky. Just trying to get at the truth. I told the truth to the District Attorney. I am not so sure about that. - You get out of here. You testified you didn't remember if you shaved Hale on the day of the parade. But a minute ago, you told me you never forgot anything. Are you calling me a liar? - No. No, I'm not calling you a liar. I just thought perhaps you forgot to remember. You get out of here, I say. Now just a minute. I can understand how you feel about getting into murder case. But you must understand that your testimony may send a man to his death. And that man might be an innocent man. Now, why don't you tell the truth? I did tell the truth. Now, you get out of here and stay out of here. Alright. Oh. Any of you folks know where the Clay family live? I'll tell you mister if nobody else will. Go straight down across the railroad track. Then turn to your right. It's the second house past the mill. - Thanks. Hello, Andy? When you get the men who beat up Pindar, give 'em a thank you and let 'em go. That beating was all we needed to put this case over. It's becoming more and more of a 3-Ring Circus every day. Everybody and his uncle has come from all over the country to see this trial. And do you know why? Because we got a new star attraction to help put it over. Michael Gleason. Michael Gleason? Yeah. He has agreed to defend Hale. He's due in town tomorrow. And will there be a crowd at the station to welcome him. I don't want to scare you any. But if I was a small-time lawyer and Gleason was my opponent .. I'd go home and start studying my law books all over again. Hello Andy? Hello? Hey, Andy! Ain't you slept at all, honey? No. But gee, that's the second night you ain't slept. I could never go two nights without sleep. You ought to see a doctor. Flodden. Flodden. Coming in to Flodden. Are you getting off here too? Yes. Going to be here long? I don't know. You should take in the trial while you're here. It will be awful exciting. I'm looking forward to it. I ain't never been to what they call the 'trial of the century'. If you tell me where you are stopping, I'll take you with me. Thank you. But I'm stopping at my daughter-in-law's. Now, ain't that a queer coincidence? So am I. Not that I like stopping with my daughter-in-law. But after all, why should I pass up a chance like this? Flodden. All out for Flodden. Mother. - Sybil, darling. I was having quite a conversation with your mother-in-law on the train. She and I got to be great friends. I was telling her that she ought to go and see the trial while she's in town. Of course, from what my son writes me .. There's no doubt that Hale is guilty and they'll send him to the electric chair. Oh no. Please don't let them. Please. This is Robert Hale's mother. Well gee, how was I to know? Come darling, we'll go now. They play rough around here, don't they. They ain't half warmed up yet. Wait until you're here for a couple of weeks. Andy. What occurred at the railroad station today .. Is an example of what is happening in this town. And you have to put a stop to it. Gentlemen, I am not concerned with the temperament or the temper of the public. I am concerned with my duty to the public. There has been a murder. The public expects me to see that justice is done. But Andy, we are only saying that .. The duties of your office do not require you to incite the public. The town is in a ferment. Now look, Andy. We don't want any riots. You know the powder keg we are sitting on. Well, what do you want me to do about it? Make sure you are proceeding against the guilty man. I have made sure. So sure, I would stake my reputation on it. You gentlemen don't think that amounts to much, do you. That is beside the point, Andy. We are only interested in what happens to this community. You mean the property you own in that community. You want my answer, gentlemen? Here it is. You should have thought of all this, Mr Mimms and Mr Doughty. Before you started splashing front page headlines in the papers you own Before you even knew or cared whether Hale was guilty or not. You, Mr Wimple. The leading banker of this town. The man who molds public opinion. Should have thought of this before you came out stating .. That in your opinion Hale was the guilty man. And you. Mr Piglet. The leading merchant of this town. You should have thought of this when you stated if I couldn't solve this crime .. You would see to it that a man was placed in office who could. Well, I am that man. And I will solve it. You should have thought of all these things before, gentlemen. But you didn't. Now you are frightened. It's grown too big for you. Well, it has not grown too big for me. You started it my aristocratic friends, but I will finish it. Tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock. I will put Robert Hale on trial for the murder of Mary Clay. And nothing and no-one in this world can stop me. Your Honor. Gentlemen of the jury. At the outset I want to say emphatically, as District Attorney. That we want no cry of prejudice or persecution raised in this case. The defendant is presumed to be innocent until he is proven guilty. The fact that he is under arrest. The fact that Robert Hale has been indicted by a Grand Jury. Should not influence you. He still has the constitutional right of every freeborn American. To be considered innocent until you, the jury .. Hear evidence which convinces you of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Now. What is .. A reasonable doubt? It does not mean the benefit of the doubt which I might give to a friend. It does not mean that truth must follow after certainty. In other words. A reasonable certainty. Resultant from evidence, whether direct or circumstantial .. Will be sufficient to bring in a verdict of guilty. And gentlemen. Don't let the phrase "circumstantial evidence" bewilder you. Difference between direct evidence and circumstantial evidence is simply this. In direct evidence. A witness testifies to the circumstances he saw. From which you, as jurors and judges. Draw your own reasonable inferences. And remember. The law says that one kind of evidence is as good as another. For instance. A man is charged with shooting a woman. And as witness testifies: I saw that man shoot her. That, is direct evidence. On the other hand. A witness may have seen shadows of them struggling on the window of her room. Heard a yell or a shot or footsteps receding. And he may testify to what he saw and heard. That, is circumstantial evidence. We come now, gentlemen. To the contention of the state regarding the crime we are charging here. This crime. Or rather this alleged crime. Took place on April 26th of this year which as you all know .. Is Confederate Memorial Day. We will show through reliable witnesses. That the girl named Mary Clay attended school on that day. We will then establish. That after Mary Clay had been dismissed from school .. She and her friend Imogene Mayfield were at a soda fountain on Main Street. At a quarter to two, she returned to the Buxton Business College. For her vanity case. A reliable witness. Professor Carlisle P. Buxton. Saw her enter the building. Another witness. Mary Clay's friend Joe Turner. Tried to discover if she was still in school. Redwine and the defendant met him at the entrance and said the pupils had gone. That Mary Clay was not in the school. That, gentlemen. Was a lie. For as a matter of fact .. She was in the school. Yes. Mary Clay had already been killed. Gentlemen. The state contends that no-one saw her leave that building alive. And on that day. When Mary Clay returned to the deserted school. Robert Hale was waiting there to murder her. No .. no! Not my son. It couldn't have happened. Not my son. I charge the defence with deliberately staging this scene to get him sympathy. Your Honor, I resent the prosecution's remark. It was the natural reaction of any mother. Especially when it's rehearsed. These are cheap, unfair tactics. You have got to go, Ma. There is both of them sitting there, Ma. Moaning at the jury, fainting in court. Making everybody feel sorry for him. I'd rather grieve at home. It ain't no use showing my grief. In front of them strangers. What can you then, Mrs Clay? You must help punish the man who killed your daughter. Mr Griffin will send the car for you the first thing in the morning. You've got to go, Ma. You just got to go. Now Miss Mayfield, when you testified this morning. You made a statement that Mary Clay was crazy, as you put it, about Robert Hale. Yes, sir. What do you mean by that? Well, what I meant was that .. Well, that she liked him. So I see. She liked him. Did you ever see the defendant make any advances towards Mary Clay? No. Did you ever hear the defendant make any endearing remarks to Mary Clay? No. In other words, you never saw them together. You never heard them speak to each other. And yet you testified that they were crazy about each other. That's all. Your Honor. May I reopen my direct examination of this witness for one question? You may. Miss Mayfield. Do you remember what Mary Clay wore on the day you last saw her? Yes, sir. Is this the garment? Yes! Yes .. I object. Your Honor, these gruesome details are prejudicing the jury. I offer this garment as State Exhibit B. I can see the headlines right now: "mother versus mother". Boy, will I break their hearts with this story. "Then, as Griffin held up the dress an unearthly sob was heard above the din." "It was Mrs Clay." "Another mother had cried out against what had happened to her loved one." "And folks, it was no longer Gleason against Griffin." "It was mother against mother, and a human life in the balance." "And who will be the one who will tip the scales one way or the other?" "Will it be Carlisle P. Buxton?" Go on, Mr Buxton. Go on. - Well, sir. He was sitting alone in his office at his desk. And it was about one o'clock. What was he doing? Well, he said he had some papers to correct. That is exactly what Robert said. And I told him to take the afternoon off. I remember distinctly, sir. There had been a slight dispute about Memorial Day. And I felt since Mr Hale came from the north. It would do him good to see the parade. Ain't nothing would have done that trash any good. Your Honor, we object. We object this entire line of testimony is immaterial. This prejudice which the District Attorney has constantly .. Striven to inject into this case .. Because of this undue disturbance. The court declares a recess until two o'clock. Yes, sir. When I arrested him he was trembling like a leaf. Especially when the boy arrived with that suit that had the blood spot on it. That is all, Mr Laneart. Thank you. Your witness, Mr Gleason. In your career as a police officer, Mr Laneart. Did you ever place a man under arrest and discovered that he was not nervous? Sure. In fact, nine out of ten times most criminals .. Are as calm as a summer day when you arrest them. Oh, I see. Criminals can brazen it out and not be nervous. But an innocent man .. I object to his inference, Your Honor. Proceed, gentlemen. That's all. "That's all said Mr Gleason to Mr Laneart. That's all." "And it sounded like an umpire telling a batter he's just struck out." "And Laneart did strike out." "So far it's been pretty even but starting tomorrow." "Gleason is going to face a lot tougher oppositions than he's had up to now." "Tomorrow, Joey Turner comes up to bat." "Mary Clay's sweetheart: Joey Turner." And? And Hale said the school is closed. Nobody is here. But I didn't like the look in his eye. So, I wanted to push past him and find out for myself. But he wouldn't let me. He stood in the way. He told me if I .. If I tried to get in he'd have me arrested for trespassing. Well, I didn't want no trouble with the cops so .. So I went back and shot some pool like I told Mr Griffin. According to your original testimony, Mr Turner. After Hale said the school was closed you turned away. Why didn't you tell Mr Griffin what happened after that? Well, I didn't think it was important. But now you do. Yeah. Now I do. - Why? Well. Because since that time and now you've surely made up your mind Hale is guilty. Objection. Sustained. Alright. Let us go back to your relations with Mary Clay. You say that you were her sweetheart for four years. Yet in all that time you testified that you had never kissed her. Well, I may have kissed her once or twice, like goodnight. Gosh, if a fellow can't kiss a girl goodnight .. Answer the question. You did kiss Mary Clay? Well, yes I did. What about it? So you lied just now as you said you didn't. I wasn't lying. Look here, you can't call me no liar. I just forgot. Oh, you just forgot? Well. Maybe you've forgotten some other things too. Your Honor, I object. The relations of this innocent boy with the girl have nothing to with this case. They have everything to do with this case. The witness testified that he was Mary Clay's sweetheart. He admitted lying. He says he forgot. Look here, mister. I'll answer your question. What went on between me and Mary Clay is none of your business. Attaboy, Joey! Attaboy! Another outbreak of this sort in this court .. And I will order it cleared for the rest of the trial. Proceed, Mr Gleason. Now, Mr Turner. When Robert Hale was shown to you in my office the day after he was arrested. You denied ever having seen him. Now you identify him as the man who was in your shop having a haircut & shave .. Somewhere between the hours of two and three on the afternoon of the murder. Yes, sir. What made you change your mind? Well, I just didn't remember at first. Then I got to thinking about it and to see his picture in the papers every day. It all sort-of came back to me. - I see. How long does it usually take you to give a man a haircut and shave? About a half hour. If you got to thinking about it could you tell me .. If it was closer to 2 or 3 o'clock when the defendant entered the shop? Well, I couldn't say. You see, I own the place. So I don't watch the clock same as if I was working for somebody else. Well, if Hale came in at 2 he'd be through by 2:30, wouldn't he? Yes, sir. How far is it from the barber shop to the Buxton building? A ten-minute walk. - Hmm. Oh. Just one more question, Mr Timberlake. When you shaved Mr Hale, did you cut him? Well, I .. Did you or didn't you? Well .. I .. Did you or didn't you? No, sir. I didn't. Now, Tump. You testified the day you were arrested .. That you saw Robert Hale twice after the school had been dismissed. The first time, a little past one o'clock alone in the classroom. The second time, about 3 o'clock when he came out of the building. I want you to think hard, Tump. You sure you didn't see the defendant at any time between those hours? Objection. It is a leading question. Sustained. I will rephrase it. Tell the jury, Tump. In your own words. What you saw and heard in the Buxton Building .. Between the hours of 1 and 3 on the afternoon of the murder. Like I said. I seen him alone in the classroom. Then, I went down in the basement. I fell asleep for a while. Then the buzzer rung. And I took the elevator up to the third floor. And there is Mr Hale standing there. And he said to me .. That's a lie! I never saw him. I never spoke to him. Sit down, Hale. - But he is deliberately lying. I must caution the defendant against outbursts of this sort. Proceed with your witness, Mr Griffin. Go ahead, Tump. What did he say to you? I don't remember exactly what he said. He was asking me something but hearing a noise. And I .. I don't remember. I just don't. - Do you remember how he looked? Yes, sir. He looked like. Like he was nervous. I'll kill him! He murdered my sister. That proves it. I'll clear the court of everyone unless order is preserved. Proceed, Mr Griffin. Go on, Tump. What .. what else did you see? I can't go on. I can't go on. - Go on, Tump. Go on. I can't I tell you. I can't. I don't remember. All I remember is .. - You saw him in the building. And he asked you if you heard a noise and he looked nervous. That's all. Just a minute. That isn't all. Why didn't you tell all this before? - I was scared. I see. And you're scared right now too, aren't you. Aren't you? - Yes, sir. I is scared right now too. Of what? Well, you see. I is colored. And. Ah, I don't know what I am saying. Or why I am scared. - Well I do. You're scared people will find out that you were the only one in that building. That you were .. - No! No, I didn't. I didn't. So help me, I didn't. I was asleep. Asleep? All the time? - Yes, sir. All the time. All the time. Then you didn't hear the buzzer. And you didn't see Hale. Well, did you or didn't you? Answer the question, Tump. Come on. You were able to talk well enough a little while ago. Alright. Answer this. If what you say is true, Redwine. You are the one .. Who is sending Robert Hale to his death. Can you walk out of this courtroom with that on your mind? No. No, I can't. I won't. I don't care what they do to me. I won't. What I said before .. Was all mixed up. And it don't count. I ain't going to send no man to die. On account of me. I don't know what went on in that building. I was asleep. I didn't see nobody. I didn't hear nothing. All I know .. Is I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. "And then the negro broke down completely and retracted his testimony." "Between you and me folks, nobody believed his retraction." "The fellow became more frightened than anything. Which made him change." "And I think so far as the jury is concerned, they believe the first part." "Yes folks, it sure was the most exciting day we've had so far." "Too bad you can't all be there to see it." "I'd say that after today's developments it looked mighty bad for Mr Hale." "Mighty bad." "When he takes the stand tomorrow he will make his final statement." As God is my judge, gentlemen. That is the true story. And the whole story. I know nothing of what happened in the Business College .. Between 1 and 3 o'clock of that afternoon. I know nothing of the death of Mary Clay. I won't keep you long. I know you are in a hurry to get this over with. So am I. One way or another. It is just that .. Before you pass judgement on me. If you haven't already. I should like to remind you that the issue involved here. Is whether or not I am guilty of the murder of Mary Clay. Not whether the North hates the South. Or the South hates the North. Thank you. The poor fool. He just dug his own grave. Mr Gleason. Proceed with your final argument. Gentlemen of the jury. For the first time in my life I find I'm in the peculiar position of having a .. Client sum up a case far better than I could ever hope to sum it up myself. In one sentence Robert Hale went right to the core of things. It took courage to do that. The kind of courage you do not associate with the skulking type of murderer .. That the prosecution pictured him to be. The issue here was not to establish his innocence or guilt. It couldn't he been. Not with the evidence presented. Evidence. Since when does evidence consist of rumors, whispers, idle talk? Nor the witnesses the prosecution put up to testify against Robert Hale. Since when can we accept the word of witnesses .. Each one of whom might have been guilty of the murder himself? Yes. Any one of them. Might have been guilty. Gentlemen. The prosecution is as aware of the real witnesses against Robert Hale as I am. And I must give him credit. He has realized their strength. Otherwise he would never have had the courage to bring this case into court. These witnesses are present. Wherever injustice is present. And their names .. Are hatred. Fear. And prejudice. Thank you, gentlemen. What is happening now? Gleason just finished. He is sitting down. That was an awful long speech he made. I'll bet he feels tired. Well mister, how would you feel if you stood talking against a stone wall? Gosh, look at Griffin. He is waving his arms. He's shouting. Boys, little Andy is sure going to town now. "Prejudice", he said. Gentlemen, that cry has been raised time and time again. But curiously enough. It is always raised by people accused of the most fiendish crimes imaginable. "Prejudiced", he says. Gentlemen, we have northerners living in this city of ours. Living in peace. In quiet contentment. Why don't they raise the cry of prejudice? Because they have nothing to hide. Because they are free and honest citizens. And because they know. That so long as they are that way there is no barrier between them and us. When a man comes in here. And commits a crime so dastardly. That it is hard to put into words. Then he is the first to raise the old cry of: the North hates the South. And the South hates the North. Gentlemen. I, who loves the South. Yield to no man in my respect for the North. But I don't admire and honor everything the North produces. Any more than I love the rotten apples we grow down here sometimes. He speaks of witnesses. Anyone of whom he says might have been guilty of the crime. Gentlemen. We don't need those witnesses to convict Hale. This proof of circumstantial evidence convicts him. And you know it. I'll stand here gentlemen and tell you. That you too will not fail in your duty to society. To humanity. To justice. To the unavenged blood of that poor girl. That you will carefully consider the evidence. That you will remember the oath you have taken to be impartial and unbiased. And that you will then bring in the only verdict that you can honestly bring. "We the jury, find the defendant." "Robert Edwin Perry Hale." "Guilty, guilty, guilty!" "Are you there, Jeff?" Nothing doing yet. The jury is still out. I will keep on talking. You answer once in a while so we know the line is okay. I wouldn't put it past the others to cut it. Yes, don't worry. We got the signal set. I got Denny planted in the next window. Not a chance to miss unless he gets shoved off and breaks his neck. Say Jeff, don't you want some color stuff while we're hanging on here? There must be thousands of people and boy is it hot. It's a funny thing though about this crowd. They are quiet. "Vote guilty if you feel like living." Nobody is going to scare me. Nobody is going to scare me. How'd you get that note? - I found it in my pocket. Nobody's going to scare me, I tell you. Nobody. I'll vote any way I like. Are you going to walk out of here as the man who hung the Hale Jury? I'll walk out of here as the fellow who voted the way he wanted to. And not because .. - Young whipper-snapper! I'd like to .. Hold it. - Hold it! Now listen, son. You ain't deciding this case according to its merits at all. You are just interested in what people are going to say about you. Now, that ain't the brave thing to do at all. The brave thing to do is to say to yourself, note or no note. I am man enough to decide this thing between me and my Lord. I'm man enough to vote guilty. For that poor little girl has been killed and somebody killed her. And all the evidence shows that Hale did it. Now you vote that way. And I'll guarantee you. There ain't a man in this town who won't say Jimmy Harrison's got more nerve .. Than all the rest of them put together. Hello Jeff. They're coming. They are coming Jeff. Coming out of the hotel. The cops are forcing the crowds back. They got a flock of extra deputies sworn in and are they tough looking babies. You should see this crowd, Jeff. They're quiet. They ain't saying a word. You sort-of get to feel that any minute they're going to break loose. It gives you cold shivers running up and own your spine just watching them. There they go. They're going into the courthouse. Sit tight. It'll all be over in minutes. Gentlemen of the jury. Have you reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. Well, you got your conviction. What more do you want? What more do you want? It's taking the governor a long time to make up his mind. If he lets Hale go we'll pull the place down around his ears. Got to be careful of them soldiers. What, them Willy-boys? They'd better be careful of us. There he is now! Not a very pretty picture, is it. Remember me once telling you .. That their cheers were liable to turn into jeers? I was right. You know what they expect, don't you? Yes. That whatever decision you come to .. Will be a just one. Nothing of the kind. They expect me to do what Griffin has done. Send Hale to his death. And if you don't? It's the finish of my career. And the beginning of Andy Griffin's. Do you believe Hale is guilty? Here on my desk are thousands of telegrams from all over the country. From people in all walks of life. Asking me to commute his sentence until such time .. As his innocence can be proven. He had a fair trial. You still haven't answered my question. The Supreme Court has found no evidence of an unfair trial. But what have you found? That the Supreme Court has only the cold printed records to judge from. They weren't here while the trial was going on. If they had been. I'm sure their judgement would have been the same as mine. That the evidence against Hale wasn't strong enough to send him to his death. That if ever a man deserved another trial .. Hale is that man. You know, Thomas. I am just a little tired of public life anyway. Aren't you? Listen. "Yes, sir?" Tell the newspaper boys to come in. I have a statement to make. What did he say? They've commuted Hale's sentence to life imprisonment. Let go of me! I've got an edition to make. Alright, boys. Let's go. Ain't we going to stay? This will be a lot of fun. No. We got something else to do. Come on. Do we have much further to go? Let's see. We've been travelling two hours. We ought to be about 30 miles from the state's prison now. I'd say we'd be there in another hour. Another hour. Why did you take me out of that jail the way you did? Why didn't you let my wife and mother see me off? Take it easy, Hale. Well? Answer me. Here. Have a smoke. It will do you good. Thanks. Keep moving. Open that door! Get the lights. What's the idea? Come on down, Hale. We've been waiting for you for a long time. Come on, Hale. There ain't nobody going to commute your sentence now. Come on, Hale! Don't take me, boys! Please. Please give me a chance. Give us a chance. Please don't take me .. Andy, that's a work of art. Especially that scowl. You know, only great men can scowl like that. Napoleon had a scowl. Cut the kidding, Brock. Say Brock, what do you think? Do I stand a chance? A chance Andy? With me and The Advocate behind you and the Hale case .. You're as good as in the Senate right now. Mrs Hale is here to see you. Send her in. Alright, Mrs Hale. I am glad you are both here. This morning in the mail I got a check from you. Why did you send it? I heard you were leaving. I knew you needed money. That's the truth, Mrs Hale. No it isn't. You sent it thinking it would help to buy back your peace of mind, didn't you. I'm surprised I didn't get one from you too. Well, I won't let you off that cheap. Take it back. Sorry about the way things turned out, ma'am. But you can't blame me for the actions of a crowd. I did what I did because it was my duty. Didn't I Brock? That is the truth, Mrs Hale. - Then you. Madam, I am a reporter. My job is to write the news as I see it. Just as it is his job to do his duty as he sees it. I wish you'd try to understand that, ma'am. All I can understand is, is that my husband is dead. They took him off a train. - They won't get away with it. I'll prosecute all the men who were responsible for your husband's death. Responsible? You are the one who is responsible. They at least had some reason for what they did. They had someone they loved killed. They wanted to kill in return. Just like I want to kill right now. But I'd rather have you live, both of you. To remember me standing here telling you you're the ones who really killed him. You're the ones who stirred up the hatred and prejudice down here. Just like Gleason and his crowd stirred it up North. And for no other reason than it suited your ambition. But it made a good story. But it isn't over with his death. The kind of thing that you have done is never over. And it will stay with you just as long as you live. No matter how hard you try to shut it out of your mind. No matter how high and how far you go. And all the money in the world won't be able to rid you of it. Because deep down in your hearts and souls you know it's the truth. Andy. Some of the things she said .. - Yeah? Nothing. Andy. Now that it is all over. l wonder if Hale really did it. l wonder. -(tg)-
