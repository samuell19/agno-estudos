SEPTEMBER Nine fifty. Catherine! THE MOST GENTLE CONFESSIONS - Tuna and sardines? - Tuna and sardines. Why don't you buy something else for a change? My pâté is very good. - All right, give me a can. - Small or big? The big one is cheaper. - A big one then. - That will be just fourteen. Thank you. - Luckies? - Two packs. One of these days you won't find your bills. Let's say a man gets a bit close to you in a crowd. Surely this happens to you sometimes? Give me a coin. Look. We could drive 300 kilometers. I'd rather go to the beach. Here we are. What is it? Well, at least we drove 300 meters. Are you playing or not? Dubreuil! The ball! How are you, Dubreuil? Long time no see. Four months. Remember? You were riding a bike. Double carburetor, a plexiglass windshield. In short: a misstep. Did you find a job? Yes, Mr Borelli. That's good. What kind of job is it? He works at my father's. - What does your father do? - He's a horticulturist. That's a nice occupation. I always loved flowers. Are you coming? - What was that? - A cop. Jean! - Were you on the beach? - Yes, since this morning. - I didn't see you. - We were lounging on the rocks, in the nude. Was it a nice sight? - Carl! What are you doing here? - Waiting for you. You look fine. What is it? The sea air? I got sick of sailing. Adventure aboard a freighter... What are you doing now? I work in a circus. You know the Lopez brothers? Twelve horses, six lions, four bears. - Are you a tamer? - Just a ring worker. The horses trot around and I'm behind them, with pan and broom. We arrived this morning and will be off again in 48 hours. That's the circus life for you. We pitch the tent, then we put it down. Sit down, I'll make you a coffee. Can we talk in front of Catherine? Yes. LOPEZ CIRCUS - Has the show started yet? - Yes, sir. About 15 minutes ago. One ticket please. Here you are. - Good evening, Linda. - Good evening, Mr Lopez. Henri, will you change the oil in my car tomorrow morning? - What time do you need it? - Noon. Don't move. Put the money on the table and open the safe. Jean, look out! You little shit! What's that book? The history of the Third Reich. Hitler was a dangerous moron, but he understood one thing: the spine of nations is infinitely supple. As is the spine of men. Your pessimism is a system and nothing more. I'm not a pessimist. When you're here, for instance. Oh, no! - Hello? - Muller? - Yes. - Borelli. - Oh, it's you. What is it? Some bullshit at the Lopez Circus. A holdup. Yes, a holdup. A large sum? - A decent sum. An employee has been hurt. - Seriously hurt? Seriously enough. That's why I'm calling. Talk louder, I can't hear a word! I can't. I said the description is vague. A young guy. Brown hair, about six feet tall. Rather handsome. No, but the Circus director is positive he'll recognize him. Yes, the car will be there in five minutes. Understood. I keep Carl's share, like we agreed. He'll get it next time the circus stops here. That alarm bell, what a shit show. I'm not crazy, am I? You did cut the wires. Batteries exist, you know. I phoned the registry. They're sending the photographs. Yeah. After all, taking a train isn't against the law. When the Police knows you, you don't split after that kind of hit. You might as well confess right away. Are you sure? Oh, I don't know. We spent the evening here. I work at your father's. That's what you told Borelli. What if they interrogate Dad? Do you think he will tell them? He doesn't like you too much, you know. Face the wall. Hands up. ID! But it's easy to check, Mr Borelli. Inspector, if you don't mind. Inspector. I was home all evening. - Alone? - No. With Catherine. You know, you saw her on the beach. Oh, yes. She's cute. - You work at her father's? - Yes. - What does her father do again? - He's a horticulturist. Come. - You little bastard! - Leave him be, Mr. Lopez. Come on now! What is this? Come on. He's completely mad! What did I do to him? I'll show you what you did to me! Come on, come on, Mr Lopez. Come on, look at him. Tell me if you formally recognize him. Look at him! Yes, I formally recognize him. I never saw you in my whole life. He's not the one who struck your employee, is he? No. That was the other one. But I didn't see the other one. Would you sign your statement? Here, please. Here. That does it. My glasses. The little bastard even broke my glasses. Some luck! Here. - How was your employee this morning? - Not very well. I'll call you with any developments. It won't be long now. They hold up for a few hours, a few days, but they always break down in the end. It's routine. Inspector. - Were you at the beach yesterday? - No, my family was visiting. - I'll go on Sunday. - You don't want to miss the sun. Autumn will be here soon. What about my file? I'm waiting for it. You'll have it tomorrow, Chief Inspector. I'd like that. - Your accomplice? - I stayed home all evening. - Where did you put the money? - I was home. Will you talk now? - Again: I was home. - Is that the best alibi you could find? Is that all? Is that all? May I? Let go of him. Can't you see he can barely stand on his feet? Miss Jorgen. I've got nothing to tell you. But I have something to tell you. Ready to order? What will you have? A lemonade. The judge indicted Dubreuil. He's going to spend several months in jail. Then there will be a trial. Yes. In criminal court. Do you love him? Since you love him, you should talk to me. Because if you don't, he'll be the one taking the fall. Undoubtedly. Hello. Yes? Yes. Dubreuil! To the visiting room. What is it? The circus employee died. Shit. That idiot. Go ahead. Where is the money? - Well? - Nothing. I should have taken the outer boulevards. We're going back. What is this mess? What is this mess, Borelli? - What mess? - Shut up! You need to understand that those methods are obsolete. I'm not your enemy. I came to help you. Very well. Dubreuil is liable to spend 20 years in jail. It's the norm. - So? - So he shouldn't. - He shouldn't, he shouldn't... - No! He shouldn't. Dubreuil is no hoodlum. He's a kid. So you must help us get him out of this. Just how, I don't know. I'm thinking. The kid can be saved. What are you, a cop or a lawyer? Marry him. It's noisy outside, I didn't quite get that. Marry him, I say. You want me to marry Jean? Inspector, are you serious? - No jury will stay insensi... - Stop it. What have you got to lose? You get to spend one hour with him after the ceremony, and, as a bonus, a reduced sentence. JANUARY Dubreuil. It's time. You're in luck, it's a beautiful day. - Been in the can for long? - Almost five months. I must admit, gentlemen, that your request is of a rather peculiar nature. But Mr Mayor, our commissioner gave you all the relevant guarantees. Yes, of course. I understand your scruples, Mr. Mayor. Allow me to say that they are honorable. I understand them all the better because I share them. And... after the ceremony? We'll leave them alone for a while. Not too long, but... We can't separate them like that. They're so young. It's almost a tradition anyway. - Is it? - Yes. The public service sometimes knows how to be nice. Right. How about taking a look at the premises? Gentlemen. Let's go. We borrowed it from the janitor. I didn't tell him what for. It's a rather delicate matter. You were absolutely right, Mr Mayor. Shall I assemble it? No. No, the men will do it. I'd love to see that. Sorry, Mr Mayor. Chief Inspector Muller is wanted. Inspector, the prisoner has arrived. Good, thanks. I have one more thing to ask you, Mr Mayor. The clock should go. As you wish. Excuse me, gentlemen. I can't believe it. Fauchu! There's a problem: they don't have any witnesses. Come closer. You look like you'd make a nice witness. Bring Montal along. He'll be the bride's witness. Go on. And have the clock taken out of the office. - The clock? - The clock, yes. Please hurry. And take that chain off. Yes, Mr Mayor. Jorgen-Dubreuil wedding. The groom, please. Here. Now the bride. Since you don't have any witnesses, Mr Fauchu and I will fill the part. It's perfectly legal. You there. And you here. Unlock him. Leave the doors open. That's the law. What about the rings? Don't you have a tie? I never wear one. Fauchu! It doesn't matter. As the law dictates, I'm going to read you articles 212 to 215 of the Civil Code. Article 212: The spouses owe each other fidelity, support and assistance. Article 213: The husband is head of the family. He carries out his duty for the common good of the couple and their children. The wife assists the husband in assuring the moral and material direction of the family, in providing for their daily needs, educating the children and preparing their future. Article 214: if the marriage contract... Berger! Mr Muller wants you. Article 215: The choice of residence for the family rests with the husband. The wife has to live with him, and he has to accept her. If the husband's chosen residence presents a physical or moral danger to the family... Benita! Catherine Claudia Jorgen, will you take Jean Dubreuil as your lawful wedded husband? Yes. Jean Dubreuil, will you take Catherine Claudia Jorgen as your lawful wedded wife? Yes. In the name of the law, I now pronounce you man and wife. Say, did the prisoner ask you for anything on the way here? Did he ask you whether we would leave him alone with his wife? After the ceremony. Oh yes, he wanted to know that. I told him that when an inmate gets married, it's customary. Neither too much nor too little. Just the right tone. Fine, thanks. Did you manage with the bed? - I pinched my finger. - I knew it. Borelli. I knew it. But I'm going with him. This way. Unlock him. If I'm needed, I'll be in my office. Hello, Madam. Hello, Dubreuil. Congratulations. You didn't gain weight, did you? So? You saw the Mayor? Just like Mom and Dad. Believe me, it's much better this way. I must say she deserves some credit. She just renounced her life. Until you're out of prison. Do you realize? Of course he does. He's not a bad guy. Well, Dubreuil? What do you want from me, Mr Muller? What do you know? He remembers my name. You didn't try to write it on my ribs. That must be why. But then again, exercising at your age... - Did you hear that? - Yes. That's funny. You guys will always be the same. None of you knows when to shut up and when to open his mouth. Are you being cute to impress your wife? You missed your shot. Bad language doesn't amuse her. You miserable insect. Show me your hands. That's not pretty. What did you do? Metal sponges. Now I'm in book-binding. In pretrial, you don't have to work. I asked to. It's less boring. I see. Well? Don't you have anything to tell us? Of course, he has. You'll see. No. He has nothing to tell us. He's really got it all backwards. Go get them. They'll take him back. But they told us... I beg your pardon? - They told us... - They? Who? Policemen. That's who. What did the policemen tell you? That they wouldn't take me back immediately. That we could have some time together. But we did give you some time alone. No... They pulled your leg, you poor devil. Is this why they put a bed in this office? Oh, that's rich. I'll give them an earful. - Were they pulling my leg? - I'm afraid so. They're very strict, you know. They have to write extensive reports for the slightest thing. So how do you want them to explain to their superiors this... whim in their schedule? Berger! Come here. - Inspector? - Get rid of this immediately. Now! What have I just learned? You told the prisoner he could stay alone with his wife? But Chief Inspector... No excuses now. Did you or didn't you say it? - I did, Inspector. - Well, you were wrong. To put such ideas in their head. Some cheap gifts, you're giving them. Take that away. Jordan! Close the door! Wait, wait. I guess you're disappointed. I can understand. I would like nothing more than to please you. Those policemen are good guys, but they have no authority to decide anything. If it were only up to me, yes, maybe. But Mr Borelli is here. He's a stickler for regulations. Sir, I'm begging you. What if he does something stupid? Did you see him earlier? Two words of compassion and he becomes arrogant. Mr Muller... Chief Inspector... - You're right. Earlier, I said something... - Idiotic? But now I give you my word that... You won't act stupid? All right, I believe you. It's fine by me. But I'm not so sure about Mr Borelli. Borelli. Dubreuil gives me his word that if we leave him alone with his wife, he won't act stupid. I trust him. What do you say? Are you insane? Look, Borelli... First he steals a bike. 15 days in jail. Does he see the errors of his ways? Fat chance. Armed robbery. Accessory to murder. And on top of that, he's making fools of us. "I'm innocent and I want to sleep with my wife". He wouldn't lower his eyes if his life depended on it. Your eyes, dammit! Your eyes! And you would do him a favor? Count me out. - When is your trial? - March. Forced labor for life. Forced labor for life? No less? How would you know? Ever heard of the independence of judicial authorities? There still are judges. They're the ones who decide, not us. I know his lawyer well. The guy is talented. On a good day, he can get away with... 20 years. Maybe 10. Assuming the jury is in a good mood. At this rate, why not give him a medal? But he's innocent. Of course, if we could find your accomplice, you would share the responsibility. Should we tell him? Look. It's simple. Surely you know that we didn't come here to congratulate you. Let alone to allow you to... You know... Listen to me. I've been given instructions. To get your confession, period. When I heard that, I decided to come along. To make sure it goes smoothly. You know me: I don't beat around the bush. So here's the deal: either you confess and fuck her, or you shut up and keep your pants on. Is that clear? He got it, you know. - This is outrageous! - No, Madam. To confess is a rather beautiful thing. And so simple. If you're guilty, you admit it. Bravely. Yes, I know. Coming from a cop, those words may make you smile. But you should trust us. That's why you didn't beat me up at the precinct. You held yourself back for the confidence game. Throw away your cigarette. Why are you so stubborn? We've got your best interest in mind. We told you to throw away your cigarette. Do I smoke? If I'd been inside for five months, deprived of women... and looking at another 20 years... Of course, we wouldn't know: we get some every night. Every night is a figure of speech. Although they say that you learn to do without it. So, you really don't want it? You don't want it? Maybe he's a faggot now. - Take your hands off him! - Enough shouting! Calm down, for God's sake! I'm not afraid of you, not me. I'm not in jail. - You've got nothing on me. - Don't be so sure. When we look, we always find something. Perjury, for example. Bastard. It's true, you're all bastards. See, we didn't have to wait for long. Contempt of a police officer carrying out his duties. I'll type a nice report. Let's not waste time, Borelli. As for you, explain to your wife that antagonizing the law is not in her interest. Surely you would know. Sit down. To each his part, Dubreuil. Policemen interrogate, perpetrators confess. And what are we asking for? A confession. I'm innocent. And you know it. You're not off to a good start, you know? First, Mr Lopez recognized you. He recognized me in the dark? How do you know it was in the dark? In the dark, was it? You sure have good information. The judge and the lawyer talked about it in front of me, that's all. - Your accomplice called you Jean. - I'm not the only Jean in town. Unfortunately, Lopez had a flashlight. He saw your face fully lit. Confess. You won't get away with it. I'll even tell you one thing now. He and I won't be hard on you. That's a promise. Look at her. She's got guts, you know. She left a rather respectable family to live with you. To starve with you, rather. We love each other. If you can imagine what that means. We'll try. I promise you. She does love you. Yes, and he knows that, doesn't he? For you, marriage is a joke, yet she married you. Yeah, buddy. She's your wife. In your heart and according to the law. With any luck, 5 minutes from now you'll be knocking her up. Do you realize? A kid. She'd be happy, you know. That would give her a reason to live. And give you a reason to hope. You would let her go just like that? Without touching her? We're not asking for anything shameful. - Not even one word about your accomplice. - And yet... How stupid can you be? Come on, talk to him, Madam. We'll leave you for a little while. Come on. Thanks. How is Elsa doing? - Who? - Elsa. Yes, she's doing alright. At least I hope so. She's doing fine without me. It's over for good? Yes. We exchanged some words. We even exchanged blows. I ended up breaking her glasses. You have a terrible temper. They're right, you know. This time, I'm screwed. - You won't tell them, will you? - Of course, I'll tell them. I'm out of options. As long as you don't confess, there is doubt. - The lawyer will... - I don't want to hear about him! I'm the one going to jail, not him. Or you. Don't you cry, now. Don't cry! - Jean, please. - Don't. You've become mean because of them. Don't be like this, and not just for my sake. Don't give them that satisfaction. You're right. Whenever they catch a guy, they turn him into one of them. You know, I've got a hard time falling asleep there every night. It's not easy for me either. I hope it's not. All right. - I've had enough. - Jean. No. No! OK, I confess. I did it. Here we are. Nice and easy. He's a poor sap. A sad little piece of shit. Take his statement. Sit down. Madam, please step outside while we type his statement. Make yourself comfortable. It won't be long. As you can see, your statement is ready. We didn't leave out a single detail. We didn't add any either. You'll be able to check. January 16, 1971. I'm listening. Go ahead. I told you: I did it. That's it. Do you confess in order to ease your conscience? It's just an expression. "I state the following... "in order to ease... "my conscience." "After due reading, I certify this statement to be true." "After due reading, I certify this statement... "to be true." Don't go too hard, you'll ruin the pen. Won't you read it? Come on, read it. It's serious. It's much better this way. You would have had regrets. Now go to her. Take your time. - One moment, please. - What is it now? - Watch your tone, will you? - That's right. We may often look the other way, perhaps too often, but you can't do anything you please. - But I just wanted... - No buts. Be civil, that's all. No kidding. Who do you think you are? - What's the rush all of a sudden? - What's the rush? I've been waiting for this for five months. Once you take me back, I'll have to live without her for years. Years. I'll only have the time spent with her today. Aren't you like me? What if you had one last chance for the next 10 years? Or maybe 20 years. Who knows? Twenty years is even worse. Wouldn't you grow impatient? Oh, sure. But there's a small difference. Sorry, Madam. Our conscience is clear. So it's hard for us to see things your way. We need to stretch our imagination. Don't toy with me like this. Just for fun. I don't have anything else. How long have we been in this office? Quite a while. Your fifteen minutes of ecstasy are already running out. Fifteen minutes? Are you serious? What time is it? Easy, kid. Easy. Tell me the time or I wreck the place. Fifteen minutes. Do you realize? What a waste. Fifteen minutes is a figure of speech. You have more than that left. - Much more? - Enough. Look, I confessed. Let me go to her. I'm begging you. Yes, I'm begging you. That's what you want, isn't it? Well, I'm begging you. What more do you need? Fuck this. You promised, and that's enough. We're chatting. Everyone is playing his part. Finally we reach an agreement, and you get angry. - What are you flip-flopping about? - OK, what do we do now? - Shall we have him taken back? - No. Not yet. All right. His statement has to be retyped anyway. Where is the damn carbon paper? Here. Today is the 16th, isn't it? Yes, the 16th. January 16. Ja... nu... a... ...ry 16. - Any progress, Inspector? - Nothing. The usual mess. It's in the bag now. Borelli is typing his statement. People really do line up to get married on Saturdays. It's almost over. Let me see. Are you happy now? "After due reading, I confirm this statement to be true. Jean Dubreuil." Don't worry, you've still got time. Not much, but more than enough. One more question. Just one. Sit down, it won't be long. You still have a question to ask me? Look, I'll sign a blank sheet. Just write whatever you want. That would be quicker, of course, but we don't work that way. We can't make stuff up for you. You confessed, that's good, but it's not enough. Well then. Who's your accomplice? Bastards! Bastards! Who's your accomplice? Who? - Who? - Just a name. - Who? - You talked earlier, and it was much more serious. You wife will lose patience. She might even not want it anymore. No, you're wrong, she still wants it. She loves him. But time flies. You prick. You, get the hell out of here. Right now. - We're among men, here. - Among men? Jean! Jean! Want me to fix your face for your wedding photo? - Do you? - You shouldn't be so stubborn. The more trouble you make, the more time you'll waste. All right. Are you feeling better? Can we talk? For a girl who just got married, having to wait so much isn't fun. You can kiss her ass. What did you say? And you can kiss my ass, too. I'm a patient man, you know. You're in luck. No, you're the one who's in luck. If we were alone... Oh yeah? Well, be my guest. Throw the first punch. What about the handcuffs? If that's what you want, we'll take the cuffs off. - Borelli... - Berger! The key! - Borelli! - What? Come on, Borelli, we can't take the cuffs off. That's against the rules. But letting an inmate fuck his wife is above-board? Absolutely not. I would have laid you out flat, kid. So you say. Are you quite done fighting? I mean, really. You're like two kids. Come on, rest a while. You can't stand on your feet anymore. - Look, Dubreuil... - No. Sorry, but we have nothing left to tell one another. I was slow, but I get it now. You don't seem to understand the difference. Legally speaking, things have completely changed. I beg your pardon? It's obvious. He doesn't understand a thing, does he? As long as you didn't confess, we considered you innocent. That's the law. Any accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. We thought you were innocent. Well... More or less. We were going easy on you. But now that you confessed and are officially guilty... You signed, didn't you? You must tell us everything. We're starting the interrogation from scratch. So, your accomplice? Don't tell us you don't know him or met him in a bar. We wouldn't believe you. In this line of work, whether we're good at it or not, we all have one virtue: patience. Once, in the dead of winter, I waited for 24 hours on a street corner. You don't like me, do you? I feel ashamed for you. I don't have a light. Look, Dubreuil. You did some bad things, but you're not a thug. You're just the victim of a legend. Mobsters. They're supposed to suffer and die without talking. I know mobsters better than you do, Dubreuil. Very few of them never talked. All of them have eaten at our table. Believe me. That's sad. He didn't do anything to deserve this. Of course, you don't care. That's not true. What if I ended your little charade? That's easy. Just watch. Don't tell them anything, Jean. I'm leaving. Shut up, you little tramp. Don't get impatient. He'll be there soon. - She's leaving? - No, no. She's waiting for him, with her fake-skinny look. She really is a nice girl. Go on, you're doing me a favor. Keep talking like this, and it'll be six months before I want her again. All this for guys you think are your buddies. Whose asses you'll cover at the cost of yours. - Who don't care about you. - To me, they aren't men. They're bums. Silence is a beautiful thing. Very dignified. Impressive, even. But stupid. Not to mention that in criminal court, no one will be sorry that he's the sole defendant. Poor Dubreuil. Have you got a light? Talk and go to your wife, will you? Do you think we like doing this? What about me? There's one thing I never understood. - That you'll never be able to explain either. - Try us. I give you my accomplice. You do? Who is he? Hypothetically. Exactly. I give you my accomplice. In my situation, I could be sentenced to no less than ten years. Provided the jury agrees to take my revelations into account. - In prison, for ten years, I'll be known as a snitch. - So what? I'm already estranged from the straight world, and the other world doesn't want me anymore, either. Once I have served my term, where will I go? What's your point? We can talk it over. Don't you recognize anyone? Sure I do. Always the wise ass. Let's recap. - You're scared of being branded a snitch. - I never said that. You didn't say it, but you may as well have. I'll make you a proposition. The very last one, because... Give us the tip under the table. No receipt. We didn't ask, you didn't tell. Everyone is happy. Right, Borelli? It's not as good as a written and signed statement. We'll make do with it. In two minutes, Catherine is yours. We'll go easy on you in court, that's a promise. Earlier, you gave me your word as a man. I trusted you. I now give you my word as a policeman. OK? You have too much contempt for me, you know. Maybe we're justified. I should thank you. You taught me something today. - We did? - Yes. All in all, I'm a rather good guy. Without you, I may have never realized it. I'm going to spend years in prison. But you will go on the same way. Your job. Wife and kids. Holidays. Between the three of us, I'm the freest. Yes. Alright... Your men are going to lose patience. Shall we go? I told you it was my last proposition. And that's your last word? If I told you my last word, you wouldn't like it. Go on, strike me. It will make you feel good. Catherine! Call, quick! Call for help! Call! Help! Stop it! You're going to kill him. He won't pull the contempt card on me again. What is it? Mr Mayor wants the Chief Inspector. Are we leaving them here? Yes, it's better. Please excuse the racket, Mr Mayor. Our prisoner has finally decided to confess. He's going to spend 10 years in prison, maybe 20... He lost his head. I want to warn you, gentlemen. If there is an investigation, I'll tell what happened. You locked yourselves in for who knows how long with the prisoner and his wife. There was shouting. Awful screams. Everyone here is a witness. You'll sort it out with your superiors. You too, sir. Of course, Mr Mayor. We'll give you back your prisoner in a second. No, leave them be. - It doesn't show, does it? - No. Go see what they're doing. Gentlemen. I'll tell you one thing, Dubreuil. I think I've seen enough of you. The mere thought of asking you one more question gives me a headache. We won't work ourselves to death, will we, Borelli? True. We're not farm animals. We'll meet again in court. I'll go easy on you. You won't forget me any time soon, will you? Quarter past twelve. We didn't see the time go by. Fauchu, do me a favor and straighten up my office. Mr Mayor! Call a doctor! Quick! You, find those cops. You should come back. She slit her wrists. - Got a cigarette? - Yes. subs: xxuuq @ KG, 2023 based on a translation by Goupil66 @ CG
