I'm 28. I'm also 28. Born… in 1972. Oh. [Seo-yeon] You like Seo Taiji, don't you? ["Ultramania" by Seo Taiji plays] Do you mean this is Taiji's song? [Seo-yeon] He'll return from the States and make a comeback in 2000. It sounds like him, but… [pensive music] [clock dings] So there's a computer inside the phone? [Seo-yeon] Yes. It's called a smartphone. You can do almost anything with it. [Young-sook] Then what about music? Do you have Walkmans? "Walkman"? Mm-hm. Wait, you don't know? [Young-sook] They play music. Oh, music? Yeah, on your phone. You can take pictures, watch movies, and even shop with your phone. Sounds like a lie. [Seo-yeon] I can understand. When I was young, I never imagined I'd be able to make video calls. [Young-sook] Video calls? Yeah! Oh, so you can see each other while you talk. That's possible? Curious about anything else? Can you see what I'm like? Oh, good question. Do you want me to find out? OH YOUNG [Young-sook] No. Why not? It will only take a couple of seconds to check. My mom told me that I'm cursed with bad fortune. [Young-sook] She said I was born with a brutal, atrocious fate. Anyway, she's crazy. She locks me up at home and doesn't let me see anyone. So you don't really get along with your mother? [Young-sook] With my mom? She's not my real mom. My birth mother is dead. I'm sorry. [Young-sook] Why are you sorry? It's not like you killed her. Actually, I also lost my dad a long time ago when I was young. [Young-sook] Really? How? There was a fire at our place. My mom forgot to turn off the gas. Hey, Young-sook. Hmm?
