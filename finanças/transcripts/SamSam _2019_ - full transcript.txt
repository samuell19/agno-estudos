You knew King Marthial the First? Oh, yes. I was his nanny for 663 years. Marthial was a very merry little boy, always clowning and prancing around to make his friends laugh. It's hard to believe now, isn't it? Well, you see, some other children started teasing him about his lisp, so young Marthial turned in on himself, and over the years, his sadness turned to anger, and his anger turned into meanness. When he became king, he drove all the children away from his planet. So I had to leave Planet Marth with all my babies. It must be a very sad place now because a planet without children's laughter is a planet without a heart. Yes! All sadness to Marthial, the nasty, silly dictator of Marth. King Marthial the First isn't nasty or silly. He's a good, strong, sensible king! [gasps] Huh? Uh, trust Mega to come up with a joke. Uh, of course I was joking. Who would ever stick up for silly old Marthial? Here's my present, SweetPea. SweetPea birthday. Nice box, but what's the M for? Uh... M for Mega. Wow! It's my ball. SamSam, you told me you lost it on Planet Marth. Where did you find it? Who cares? It's only a gift. If you don't like it, I'll take it back. No problem. Some things we can never forget. And this is the royal M of Marthial the First. I'm positive. [gasps] [burp] You're Marthial's sister? No! I'm his daughter. [gasps] Mega, I'm confused. Who are you really? I'm Mega Lactic. I'm half-Marthian, half-Saturnian. And a mega fibber. A mega dictator's daughter. Who plays mega-mean tricks. And is going right back to her mega-mean daddy. SamSam, it's true. I am Marthial's daughter. But I'm also your friend. No, you're not. Friends don't lie to each other. Oh, yeah? Well, you know what? I'd rather be the real daughter of a great dictator than a fake cosmic hero with a silly little cape and a teddy bear. [spaceship starting] Are you okay, SamSam? No, I'm not. Can't you understand some people just aren't as cosmic as you? Come on, SamTeddy. We're leaving. SamTeddy? SamTeddy? [sobbing] Didn't I warn you that children are nasty? You mean you... You know where I've been? [whistles] You've been spying on me all along? Correction. I've been training you so that you'd see for yourself what mean little beasts children are. They were mean to me, and now they're mean to you. But thanks to your good advice, we're going to get our revenge! But first, pull that bear out from under the seat. Huh? SamTeddy, where are you? Hi, SamSam. We weren't sure how to tell you, so take a look. Mega flew back to Marth? As if I didn't know. SamTeddy? What's he doing there? He may have had no choice. It's obvious to me. Mega kidnapped him. SamTeddy, I'll never abandon you. I tried your recipe for cabbage with broccoli. It's not bad, but I think a dash of spinach would give it more flavor. It could, but spinach disagrees with me. - It gives me gas. - Yeah, me too. Hey, it's the brat! What? Aah! [straining] Hello, SamSam. Oh, SamSam! Good of you to drop in. Why did you kidnap SamTeddy? Ask him why he stowed away on my rocket. Nastiness is such a tonic. I love special effects! Today is the greatest day of my life. Thanks to Mega's advice, I've finally figured out how to make a monster that will stop children laughing forever and ever. [laughing] All I have to do is turn you into miserable, gray little things, as sad as stones. [laughs] Children will always laugh. [laughing] Quiet! Laughing time is over. Behold! The devilish Gloomyglob monster! The devilish Gloomyglob monster is made of a mixture of... slug slime, stingy toothpaste... sting... dead tree bark... bang... and moldy old car tires. It's easy to use and extremely effective. It is attracted to bright colors, such as cheerful clothes and rosy cheeks. And then it bombards them with gloomyglobs that gloomify them on the spot. And from then on, all you brats will sit around at home alone, staring at your screens. Goodbye, fun and games. Hello, grayness and gloom. But in order to work, it needs one more tiny ingredient, which doesn't exist on Planet Marth. The tear of a child. I'll never cry for you. You won't? Then how will we manage? Who stings? We sting. Who do we sting? You! If you think I'm scared of your stupid bouncing blobs, you're wrong! Stupid, but stingy. Release all the Thingamaboobs! Stingy, stingy, stingy! Stop. Wait. I can make him cry. SamSam, dear, you really are the smallest of the smallest cosmic heroes. You know what your friends say? They say if it weren't for your parents, you wouldn't have been admitted to Cosmic Hero School. Does it hurt to hear the truth? Enough to make you cry? 'Cause you're going to cry. And thanks to your tears, no child will ever laugh again. But look on the bright side. No child will ever laugh at you again either, SamSquirt. You're meaner than I would ever have dared to imagine. [whimpering] [laughing] Wonderful! Come to me, sad little drip. [laughing] I may be the least cosmic person in the universe, but if I cried, it would be because I lost my best friend, a girl named Mega, who used to enjoy laughing and dancing and singing with me and all our friends. Who's a lucky monster? You are! There! [yells] It's not supposed to gloomify me. It can't, Your Marthialty... uh, Majesty. Gloomyglobs don't affect Marthians. Isn't that amazing? Yeah, fascinating. But I've got a child to deal with. Gloomyglob monster, gloomify that boy! [barking] Eww! Yes! What? Sabotage! Friends for life. Quick! Look out, Marthial! The little red devils are getting away! Where did they go? Get moving and gloomify them for badness sake! Halt! Whoa! [screaming] SamSam, what are you doing? Monster-to-confetti! Confetti? Monster-to-confetti! Confetti? No! SamTeddy!

I take my orders from King Marthial the First. You're going to learn to take orders from Mega the First. I decide and you obey. Now get to work. Confetti? [tinkling] Confetti? [grunting] [screaming] [horn honks] Oh, no. School's out forever. No one will ever learn anything here again. Uh-oh. Confetti! Put me down right now, you big brutey-woot, or I'll call my friend SamSam! Nuff of that. Geronimo! [muffled cursing] [chuckling] SamMommy, SamDaddy, save me! Ask somebody else, Mucky Yuck. We're too busy doing nothing. Confetti? - Move-yourself! - This is awful. Should we go see SamSam's parents? Wait, look! Now don't you worry. I'll mix up a nice drink of stinky sock juice. - Where's SamSam? - I don't know. Let's check the soccabasket field. SamSam, there's a giant monster attacking Planet Sam. A mega monster! I know. And it's going to gloomify us all. So it isn't all bad news then. We need to lure it to Marth. The Marthiantist is making a bomb to destroy it. Are you sure it's not us you want to lure there and capture? And why should we trust you? Everything that's happened is because of you and your lies. Hey, guys, it's really our fault because we all rejected her. I trust you, Mega. Thanks, SamSam, but we'd better hurry before... [gasps] Confetti? No! Ugh. No! Join the club. This can't be happening. Gloomyglobs aren't supposed to affect Marthians. But you're half-Marthian, half-whatever. The grayness seems to work slower on you. Run, guys! I'll cover you. I'm 100% Marthian. Confetti! ♪ Hush, little baby Don't say a word ♪ ♪ Mama's gonna buy you a... ♪ [coughs] Fathola dear, did you see that? My monster, it's come back! And hasn't it grown? Marthial, why is your monster chasing after our daughter? SamSam, look out. Oh, no, not the flowers! Yikes! I'm in for it now. Marthial, get off your royal behind and go rescue our daughter right now! Certainly! Right away, Fathola dear. This is King Marthial the First calling. Pulverize the monster! Launch all the rockets! Calling all squadrons. Attack formation. Fire at will! Help! Holy smokes, we're up against it. But don't worry. I have another idea. My Marthiantist! Your Marth-what? Wait and see. After you, Fathola dear. [humming] Quick! Make an anti-monster bomb. What do you think I'm making, cupcakes? Aah! What's that? Huh? Oh, her? Ignore her. It's nobody. She's only my wife. How's the battle going? What? What's that? [groans] Confetti? [screaming] Confetti! [shuddering] Huh? A child. Catch them! Confetti? SamSam, quick. [groans] Brats! [growling] Aah! My rockets! My nose! It's broken everything! Marthial, your nose is irrelevant. When will this anti-monster spray be ready? Abracadabra. An anti-gloomyglob monster bomb, made out of fizzy candy, tickly feathers and Christmas cracker jokes. Isn't that amazing? Would you do the honors, Madam Marthial the First? [laughs] Oh, golly! Quick, Marthy, the video! Show some respect. Now the roof, Your Maj. [humming] One little push on the button and boom! [plop] [sniffles] Ah... ah... ah... Ah-choo! Aww... [crying] Holy smokes! Your recipe doesn't work. It's gloomifying my Marthians, too, now! Find me a solution and be quick about it! No, no, I can't work under this stress. Mother, Father, look. I've changed color. I've always been sad, but now it shows. Mega, my darling child. Quick, cook up an antidote for my daughter, lickety split! It looks more like we need a cosmic hero. Confetti! Chomper, look after SamTeddy. Marthial, quick, shut the lid. FATHOLA: Marthial. I order you to obey SamSam. Yes, yes, yes, yes! Right away, right away! [rumbling] Whoa! Whoa! Confetti? Mommy! Whoa! - Ow! - Oops. - Oops. - Oops? - Whoops. - Oops. Oops? Mega! Stay here. I'll deal with this. [gibberish] Uh-oh. Stinger alert! ♪ Pee-pee in their undies Pee-pee in their beds ♪ Teddy gonna pee-pee! Don't touch my teddy! [wolf whistle] Aah! It's the deadly Kissybug. ♪♪ [Latin] Mambo! Mambo? ♪♪ [continues] Aah! Stinga-butty! Aah! Stinga-stinga-stinga! [straining] - [laughing] - I think I get it. To beat the monster, we have to make it laugh. Who wants to wee-wee? [barking] Aaah! Teddy pee-pee! Teddy bear pee-pee! Teddy bear pee-pee! [barking] Pee-pee Marthial! Oh ho ho ho! Hee hee hee! [laughing] Pee-pee, wee-wee! Whoa! Aaah! Waahh! [laughing] Mega, SamTeddy, your colors are coming back. SamSam, quick! Get the anti-monster sprays. Ah! Thanks, SamSam. [laughing] Majesty, we have to make it laugh. - I don't even know to be funny. - Yes, you do. GrannyPea told us. When you were a boy, you were always clowning around and making people laugh. No, no, I can't. It makes my head hurt. Yes, you can. It's easy. Watch. - [raspberries] - [laughing] It's working, SamSam. Keep it up. - [raspberries continue] - [vocalizing] Is that funny? I've got an idea. Trust me. No, no, no! Let me down! Let me down! [laughter continues] SamSam, put me up again. Oh, no, not the cannonballs. Not the cannonballs! [laughing] You've got it, Your Majesty. - You're funny. - Am I? - Catch! - Huh? Not Icky-sicks. They stink! [laughing harder] It's working, SamSam! - Go for it, Dad! - Hooray! Hmm? Ugh! My sock juice could do with a few more boogers. Hee-yah! Hey, kids, everything okay? [laughing] I'm grand and glorious and powerful! SamSam, the lever. But watch me now be laughable! [laughing] [laughing] Hooray! [laughing] [continues laughing] [laughing harder] Confetti. Aah, SamSam, the monster! Yes, but it's teeny-weeny. I hate teeny-weeny things. Confetti. In you go! Yeah, about time too! Mega, darling. Mommy. Hey, that's my scepter! SamSam, Daddy, you did it. Oh, my dictator girl. You've got your colors back. Are you quite finished? One itsy-bitsy monster, one tear of joy from a dictator, and shazam! Goodbye dreary, hello cheery! Confetti! Cheery. That's how I like you. SamSam, you're the greatest cosmic hero of all. Thank you for rescuing our little Mega. - Confetti. - Marthial! Thank you, SamSam. Good job, SamSam. [giggles] SamSam, you defeated the most powerful monster in the universe. There was no ready-made cosmic spell to do it. You had to find other, better ways to beat it. You used courage, good thinking, and above all, friendship. Friendship is your first power, SamSam. - Hooray! Whoopee! - Bravo! - Well done! - Good job, SamSam! Thank you, thank you, everybody. It's been a great adventure. This star is beautiful, and I'm really glad to have it. But the next one will be for a real mega cosmic power. Something tells me I might get it today or tomorrow. Sometime soon, anyway. - Hooray! Whoopee! Bravo! - Well done, SamSam!
