-= Episode 9 =- Father, I went home. I will keep the promise to you that I would protect Ji Na. No need to worry. Mother, Gang Chil didn't come? What are you doing looking for Gang Chil at this night time? He was with Dr. Jeong during the day. He probably stayed to eat or have a drink after work. You go look after your child. Gang Chil is eating and having a drink with Dr. Jeong? The rain has stopped. It's raining again. You won't be able to go home. Stay some more and go. I mean... that... You really can't go now. Just now when I was coming here, there was puddles and mud all over. The car's wheels were getting stuck and it was very difficult. Really, the car won't get through it. I mean... Because I stutter when I talk, you don't believe me, but it's true. Last time also when it rained a lot, the tires got stuck in the mud. To get the car out of that in that rain was so much of trouble for me. Miss Ji Na, I'm not just saying this to keep you here. I.. I mean, I wouldn't say such a lie, right? You don't believe it? Fine then. Go ahead. Leave. It's not me getting into trouble, it will be you. Go then. Leave. Once the rain stops, I will go. This week when you didn't see me, what were you thinking about? I haven't been thinking about anything. You said you had to think about it. Then why weren't you thinking? It's just... As I didn't know what to think about, I didn't. No money. No education. Criminal record. Poor health. Why nothing to think about? There should be a lot. I heard from Dr. Gim, that earlier it was you who hit me with the car, Ji Na ssi. I know that's why you know I have cancer. When you say it, how can you be smiling? Then what? Should I cry? My health is still good, actually. In my body, the white blood cells or whatever it is are fighting with the cancer cells, and are beating them. Totally winning. Even then, you should get hospital treatment. There's no need. I'll just do it myself. Even then... If I get hospital treatment, Ji Na, what will you do for me? When I was little and I helped my mother, then also I got something. Like steamed potatos. If I get treatment, what will you do for me? What should I do? I'll think about it. What should I get you to do? What would be good? You've brought the evidence, right? =Of course.= Okay, I know. Let's meet at the intersection. I'll give you the money there. Go now! Yong Hak will be getting there soon. This time, if Yong Hak escapes, we won't be able to catch him again. This is the last chance. =Glad to see you, Chan Geol.= We'll let go at the same time. It's done! Ji Na. Open your eyes. Open you eyes and look, Ji Na. Not at me, over there. I'll go catch it, so you can see it better. No, you shouldn't. If it picks up a human scent, when it returns to the mountains, it will be shunned by its kind. Oh. Let's just look at it. And... I love you. That is... I did have to tell you that I love you. I didn't know when would be good to do that. I shouldn't say it like that? Was it strange? It's all right. Let's stay here like this, until it leaves on its own. Pak Chan Geol. I don't trust you. Ketchup is just like real blood isn't it? Hey, District Attorney Pak! Looks like you have a lot of cases. Already now it seems that you are pulling off some big things? Wow. Impressive. More than 70 drug traffickers. How come you get such big cases every time? What's your secret? It's just that I take work seriously. What secret could there be? And oh... About O Yong Hak's case... Somehow, doesn't it look interesting? I'm wondering if I should take that up. There. There. Lately, you've been going to Busan to study, right? Because Seoul is too far to go. I might have some work at a tourist ranch there. Hoping he'd be frank, as he trusts me, I asked the Cultural Center Director if he knew of anything there. If he knew, then to introduce me for some work there. It turned out that they do need some repair work. I've decided to do it once the Cultural Center work is finished. I must be doing a good job, for me to be finding more work, right? Don't do it like that. Like this, like this. You asked me to do like this. So stubborn... When did I tell you to do it like that, like that? I told you to do it like this. Like this, like this. Like this, like this... You had said. If I do it like that, I may never finish. See me do it. Aigoo, look. Look at you. So much smeared on you. It is fine. Please do the work. Let's talk casual... ly, please? Nowadays, when people get close, it seems they do that. How 'bout us too? Though I'm much older than you, I'll be cool with that. Don't wanna? Hmmm... No. Yo! You ain't bad at that! Whatever you do, no bother you'll survive, eh? Asshat, whaccha lookin'? You have to go fix a bite, no? Tha... Wha..what? Asshat? Why? You hate my casual talk? Go back on it? Go back? Hey, a real man means what he says. Wha.. What going back? You must not know 'bout me. I ain't one who goes back on my word. You know? What I say, I say once, and for ever... I'll be taking it back. Why? I'm too cute for you to do casual talk? Hmm... If you do that I will faint, I think. That can't happen. So don't try to figure out a man's mind. You'll be frightened. When do we meet again? Sunday. Who will call? You will. Doing the cool talk to me, is that much fun? Yeah. Is that so? Hey, aren't you the one who gave me some lip last night? That surprised you! I shall be calling you. What was that? Laughing so much... All mushy mushy and bye bye. Lord, lord, lord, lord, lord, lord... It's happening. It has happened! What? Disciplinary service work for 7 days? Having done no wrong, rather than apologizing, this is better. Bloody brat. You're doing the work fairly well. Might as well do it with your father, like this. I'll give you enough wages. Talk about that later. You two. What happened after you went to the water channel? Why do you keep asking, so curiously? You should date too, then. I am so busy being an angel. Where's the time to date? I'll be happy just seeing you do it, hyeong. And then? After you went to the channel, you went to the abandoned barn? Aigoo. Aigoo. Hey. Then didn't you do this with the dress... This guy, this guy! Doing things like a pervert... When Jeong Ui is there... I too know what I should know! What do you mean you know? Cocky bastard. You didn't undress? That's enough, you! Then there's nothing great to hear. And I thought there would be some progress. There happens to be progress! I don't really want to hear. What, hyeong did naughty naughty like this with nuna or what... Brat. You think love is only about that? I'm not interested in love. Then drop it. You're really not interested? But if you want to say something, go ahead. I can listen... though it'll be boring. Kissing... Did that. Stop. It tickles. Okay, then you feel happy, right? Then I should be able to become an angel. Aja! What? What is it? Yu Jin keeps asking for a fight. What are you doing? I told him to meet at 5 at the breakwater. Well done! Today we'll have a good fight. That kind of brat needs a good lesson before he ends it. Right, hyeong? Why talk? Let's physically give him a lesson he won't forget. Come on, really! Are you sure that you two are really my dad and uncle? - May be... it's so. - May be... it's so. Here, there is an abandoned dog adoption center. If you go there and notify, someone will come pick it up. Ah, yes. Aigoo. Such an adorable fellow. Who abandoned you? Exactly. Thank you. Yes, take care. Thank you. The doctor who came yesterday, got the Corona vaccine? Mmm... On doing vaccine inoculation against that, have you informed the farm folks? I did. As you didn't, at least I had to it. I'll do everything today. If there's work, you can still leave. After spending the night together, how does it feel? I thought you were someone who was thoughtful. What are you trying to do? From now, you plan not to have any semblance of a thought? As the fellow you like is a brazen thoughtless guy, To date that fellow, what, you feel you too have to be thoughtless like that? So someone who was so thoughtful drops all thoughts, does whatever she wants, and plans to be just like him, you silly girl? Because there's no need to think. What? Oppa, at the time I met you, I had really thought a lot. Isn't the result what we have now? What do I need from thinking about it? Studying abroad... You were to do it for one year. When it's time, I'll think if I'll go. I would talk only if I saw it with my eyes. If I didn't see anything with my eyes, would I talk? The way that Gang Chil and Dr. Jeong were laughing and chortling together... With these two eyes, I saw it very clearly. Even if a knife is held to my neck, I'd say I saw what I saw. Who are you to say that? What you see with your eyes is all there is to facts? My Gang Chil is doing the work on Dr. Jeong's animal hospital building. They discuss what to do or not, keep or change. You yak-yak about what you don't know. What would my Gang Chil want to do with Dr. Jeong? Oh sure! Isn't it so! Those two are just doing the work... on the animal hospital, right! But that should only be till the work is finished, no? And it was not in front of the animal hospital that I saw them! It was at the foot of the mountain. Those two who just woke up in the morning... Why would they go to the foot of the mountain? What? Foo... Foot of the mountain? Like they can't do it in any village! You know that's how it is, no? If Dr. Jeong were your daughter, would you let her see someone like Gang Chil? As Dr. Jeong is a good person, she would be nice to Gang Chil, but still you should say that this just can't happen! If it were me, and Gang Chil were my son, I would put my foot down and ask him not to dream! No matter how much effort Dr. Jeong makes, this just cannot happen. If you have some conscience, thinking only for "my son" is just not right! My Gang Chil... It will be Hyo Suk that he will be marrying. Dr. Jeong is someone I don't even like. I don't even like her. Mother, what is it that you don't like, to yell so loudly like this? You... will be marrying Gang Chil? If he says we should. Why? If it's so, Gang Chil has to clear out Dr. Jeong, for you to start on it. That brat... is clearly two-timing. What is that ajumma talking about? Hyo Suk, you and Gang Chil pick a good day! ~ Just like this. Just like this. ~ ~ One more time, we're trying to do it. ~ ~ Just like this. Just like this. ~ Why are you so happy? ~ Then why are you like that, so unhappy? ~ Today you worked with your father, and earned some money. And, the fellow who is bothering you is going to get a lesson from us. What is there for you to grumble about? I hate fighting. Who likes to fight anyway? To land a punch, you need to take two, and that's what a fight is, for me. Aigoo. I don't like fighting either. They've come, they've come. They've come here, these guys. How many fellows? One, two, three, four... Where did uncle Guk Su go? As I felt I could handle it alone, I told him to go and work. Should I have asked him to come along? Should we call him in? I really hate this! You brought your father? Aigoo! Why might the father have come even here? He's come to give us some allowance? Isn't this too much, the mismatch in numbers? What do you mean "too much"? Seeing that you're a gangster, shouldn't we have this many? The gangster thing was before. Now I'm a successful carpenter, brat. If you are to talk, have a proper clue first. You really talk nonsense, I see. If you brandish that thing, it's attempted murder, you know? A gangster's words... Who would believe it? Nobody will believe it? What else? When Jeong Ui talks also, none of the teachers or students believes it. If so then, would they believe a gangster's words? Yeah, indeed! It's fine, it's fine. Wow, makes me tear up. Daddy love! - You punk! You want to die! - Stop! Hey! Guk Su! Still not done? That will do! Hey kids! Over here! What is he? Did you get all of it? Now for this... 010 9876 654... 654? Hey! What's after 654? Your father's number! Your mom's is what I'm very sure of. Your father's is rather unclear. I have to send him the video of you beating to death a poor ajussi with a wooden stick. So what's it?... Your father's number. Quick, go get that fellow. Catch that guy! Ah, I just remembered. Now for this... Okay. Now, to do this... Hello? Excuse me, this is the police station, right? There's a gang fight here. What are you looking at? Run, kid! I'm calling the cops, you punks. The cops are coming. Run fast! Brat, where are you going? Bastards! You come with me! Let go! Sorry. It was just a prank. Let's go, Jeong Ui! Your mobile keeps on beeping. Take the call. It's my business... To take it or not. It looks like your father is looking for you. With a wooden stick, you were hitting a man so hard. Seeing it he'd be pissed. Right? Take it. Damn, I don't want to! Don't speak disrespectfully to my father. Well done, my Jeong Ui! You aren't taking the call? If you dare to mess with our Jeong Ui even once more, it won't be to you that we send the picture, rather it will be to your father and the cops that we will send it. Understand? Eat the noodles! You should know that it was only some decent elders that you ran into. We too had tried to do the bad stuff when we were young. We really can't let you be like this. When you can't even be sent to jail. How about the Internet cafe for a game? I guess not. Just leaving like that? Please be well. Father, I'm going to the Internet cafe. Jeong Ui! Don't play too much and be late in getting home. But first you should get home, no? Tell me. Are you dating Dr. Jeong? The word has spread all over the town. Already it has spread? Who's doing what with whom? Are you crazy? The one that Ji Na nuna likes would be a thug like my hyeong? Crazy! Nuna, you are a divorced woman. It should be a divorced man for a divorced woman. Hyeong is a thug. For a thug, the bride is... Anyway, only birds of same feather flock together. How can he dare to be anywhere near Ji Na nuna? Another bowl. That's enough eating. Why are you pigging out? Because it's delicious. Give me a bit more. Seriously... You idiot! I told you not to say you are seeing Ji Na nuna, and you say you are, what can we do? Why must I hide it? Why hide such things? We haven't found the facts yet. What if Ji Na's father comes to know? Hyeong... is your brain made of rocks? I found out where Yong Hak's father is. Today, I'm going to Seoul to see my father, and then I'll go and see Yong Hak's father. So until the facts can be established, hyeong, you should keep your mouth shut. Understand? I am someone whose entire life was made exhausting by those who lied. I'm certainly not doing anything like lying. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! It seems Gang Chil is in love with Ji Na? True? Suddenly I feel full. Jeong Ui, I received your mail. Getting your mail makes me truly happy. Im Su Mi... I know your mother very well. I wish to see you. Next semester, as there is a seminar in Seoul for a month, I will be coming there. I'll see you then. Your mother's passing makes me very sad. What are you doing, trying on clothes early in the morning? If you're wearing it, wear it. If not, then don't. Putting it on and taking it off, putting it on and taking if off! Aigoo... Lucky that I have two nostrils, so I can breathe and live. If I only had one, I would be choking and going crazy. You think Dr. Jeong is crazy enough to like someone like you? Mutual liking! What, shouldn't it be mutual liking? It is only you who is thrilled to death about this. What if she does like it? What? Mom, you know, I... I have never been happy like I've been lately. Mother, you too know that even since I was small, I wasn't one who wanted to do a whole lot. But now, like mad, I want to do it all. I want to earn money, I want to dress well, and I want to be a great guy. I want to be happy and cheerful! Mother, I... If that woman asks me to come, I'll come. Asks to go, then I go. Asks to die, then I die. Not pretending. I'm really prepared to die. Not using my head, but my heart. Really I, deeply and sincerely, love her. Like that! Aigoo. You incurable lunatic! Why are you like this? You like it, but act like you don't. Was in jail so long, unable to see a woman, and he's really gone insane. Mother, right now I am in a really happy mood. I feel the whole world belongs to me, you know? He is young, and can't remain single. He doesn't like Hyo Sik either. If he likes that woman, what's wrong? When it's time to go through with it, he won't. Why are you like that? Father, you really don't remember me? Yong Hak Hyeong's senior high school hubae. (Hubae - junior classmate, colleague) I even came to your house several times, and owe you a lot for help. You don't remember? I don't... remember. Aigoo... Father, you're getting old. You have. You even said that I looked like your wife, all pretty. Whatever that is, I don't remember you. And also, Yong Hak asked me not to talk to anyone. Father, father. I... absolutely have to meet Yong Hak hyeong. Where is Yong Hak hyeong? Father, you know, right? I don't know! Last week, Yong Hak said I absolutely mustn't talk. He said the evidence would be snatched away. Ah... so it's like that. As the evidence might be snatched away, he told you not to talk? Then I shouldn't ask. I understand. I'll come again later. Please look after your health. Ajussi. Ajussi Mr. O. What do we do? It seems your son was in a car accident. What? That's what I said. It's 100% certain. It's his father who has the evidence, not Yong Hak. If his father has the evidence, would he tell us? If he doesn't tell, we'll just have to look for it. His father is a bit senile. It seems we can get him to spit it out. Hyeong, first go have fun with Ji Na nuna. Love is to be enjoyed. You know it, right? Yes, I know. Aigoo, the weather is great! =Seoul DA Office, Largest Drug-offense Arrests= =As our long investigation was able to obtain results, I am personally extremely delighted.= =Seoul DA Office, Largest Drug-offense Arrests= =I've done my utmost to fulfill my obligations.= Those guys who got caught... I've checked on them. Completely sad. They were at clubs or Internet cafes and just consumed what others gave them. Suddenly the police rush in. It's Pak Chan Geol's war, but the police has joined forces. The kids are just raising the conviction numbers. I know it as well. But what do you want me to do? I'm only in the General Affairs section. It's the witness from when my dongsaeng had the accident. (Dongsaeng - younger brother or sister) It says that, due to an accident he's unconscious. Would you like to taste it first? I'll do that. - More. - Pardon? More. Top. Top it! More, more, more, more, more, more! Nice! He's singing well. But... Though this is tasty, the quantity is a bit less. That's why I said to go directly to the barbecue restaurant, didn't I? I really wanted to go with a woman to this kind of restaurant. Having come here once, I won't be coming again. Once and done! Mr. Gang Chil, voice a little... This much will do? 17, 18. You said it was 256 000, right? 19, 20, 21, 2, 3, 4. What should we do now? Gang Chil, whatever you want to do, tell me. We can do it all. Really? Then, kiss once more? Yeah, sure... Didn't you say that you would do whatever I want? And also, for me to want to kiss doesn't mean anything else. It's because, though we kissed, we were often a bit awkward. So, because we feel awkward, we should kiss? May be, last time with me, it was due to awkwardness that we kissed? No. Because I love you. Ah, kisses are done because of love, and not to get over awkwardness. Idiot! Idiot! Now, can I kiss you? I feel like I love you. I really shouldn't talk to you. Why do you say one thing and then another? Didn't we just say that one can kiss because one loves somebody? So now, because I love you, I should be kissing you. Let go! Just now, didn't some noise come out? No, I didn't hear it. I'm sure there was some noise coming out. Why are you like this? I don't want to! Didn't I say no to going to a motel? Over there, is there someone? Where are you going? Seems like a woman is being troubled. Don't go! It's only a lovers' quarrel. I had just seen a couple. They were kissing. We already kissed, right? Why can't we sleep together? I said I don't like that. Not to do that. Let go of my hand! Didn't the woman say she didn't like it? Woman can be like that for no reason. Miss Ji Na, you aren't so, but other woman are all like that. Even when they like it, they say they hate it. Just cannot, not, not, not, then YES. That's how women are. I heard if from my mates and sunbae who had been with many women. (Sunbae - senior, mentor) It's true. What kind of sunbaes and mates said that? Prison sunbae, prison mates. Really, people should never be in prison! Come here. Hey. I said I love you. Let's sleep together! - What's he doing? - You... why are you like this? - Really, it doesn't look like just a lover's quarrel. - Come here!... Sleep with me!... - Didn't the woman say she doesn't like it? - Come here!... Sleep with me!... Come with me. - No! Help me! - Let go! - No! - Didn't the woman say she doesn't like it? Let go! This silly bitch is crazy or what? - You'll get it... - You punk! Oh, there... Take this bag too. Let's go now. Let's go, let's go. Gang Chil, behind you! Are you all right? This punk! Has nothing better to do than philander women... It's the police station, right? This is at Busan East district... You can't! Right... Ex-convict... If I weren't an ex-con... we surely would've called the police, to send you to jail. Let's go. Come. Just now, I think I saw some police on patrol. You... For me being an ex-con, you better be thankful! There! There's an ex-con hitting people! There's an ex-con! I am just a harmless guy. Don't you see that I'm a jailed ex-con with only past convictions? What? They don't believe you? Why don't they believe you? Why would those guys believe me? Now you know how a person like me finds it not easy to survive, right? Stop there! So much fun! It was fun for you too? You are unpredictable, silly or angry! Didn't I say something then? About when a woman says no? Then it's a no. Absolutely, no. If it's a no, and he touches her, even if it's love, he goes to jail. And also? If I see a woman like just now, I have to help. Well done! I does feel like I did well. I thought I would be going back to prison. My heart was so nervous, you know. Next week, let's go to the mountains. Gang Chil, though it's not the Seorak Mountain that you like, let's go climb a mountain, roam around the rural markets, eat some patjuk... and also... also... (Patjuk - Adzuki bean porridge) But why do everything in one go? We should save some for later. Next week, let's just go mountain-climbing. No. Let's do all of it. No matter what time it is, what can be done now... should be done to the extent possible. All of it. You are leaving me or something? As we're dating, from now on we can meet every day. Why do it all in one go? Little by little, separately, and bit by bit enjoying while doing it. So many stars! Why are you changing the subject? That star... do you know its name? That one. Does it look like I would know? That is Jingnyeoseong, in the northern celestial hemisphere. (Jingnyeoseong - Korean name for the star Vega) Oh, would you like me to teach you constellation names? Ji Na, when you see me, you just want to teach me stuff? You see me as a dummy, and so you feel you just have to teach me things? So, without answering anything I ask, you just say what you want to say? Where are you suddenly going as we are talking? Are you that peeved? I mean... Is that something to be angry about? If a woman says no, don't touch her... Is that such an angering matter? Or, if I teach you about stars' names, should that make you angry? This is really difficult. And when we're having fun, Suddenly saying "go home". Where did you learn that? You're not a child, you know... If you're angry, just say why you're angry. You can't just sulk and ask to leave like this. Perhaps you don't know even that? Ah really, you won't loosen up a bit? I also want to teach you something, Miss Ji Na. On television, it's all men who do the teaching. Everyday, it's like I am to be trained. "Don't do this, don't do that." "That is a wrong way of thinking." Just today at the restaurant when I was talking, it was, "Lower your voice and speak"... When I wanted to kiss you, I don't even know why you would be like the time wasn't right. Always a show-offer! - It's not called a show-offer, it's... - Again, showing off! Always picking on words. Oh... What's this? Want me to teach you how I made this? What is that? Don't be like that. Let me take a look. - Saw it, right? - Really... Not like that. Let me take a look. How did you make it? Shall I teach you? If you carve it just like that from stone, it just won't come out right. It's more difficult than you imagine. It must be stored in the brain, just like a computer. The full concept, that is. Then it'll work. - Ah... concept. - That's right. Concept. If isn't not fully conceived and you start engraving, the piece will not be as complete. It would already be death-on-arrival. - On-arrival... Death? - That's right, death-on-... And then finally, you paper-scratch it. Ah, sandpaper. Good job! But, why did you tell me to stop here? Not going home? I want to go to the convenience store. Need to buy something? I'll run there. What are you two doing? What are you two doing? You two went out for fun? - Yes. - No. It was... I was on my way back from Busan. On the way, I saw Mr. Gang Chil and I just gave him a lift. I don't believe it, Dr. Jeong. Could it be that you both are dating? Tell me. You both have been dating? No. We're not dating. Well then, I have something to do. Let me leave first. You two are dating, right? The child will catch a cold. Go home. Ah... Whether you're taking the call or hanging up, you need to respond. Tomorrow I have an exam. I've heard that phone ring so much that it's stuck in my brain. Take the call! It's me. For yesterday... I'm sorry. Why did you talk like that? Let's meet. Where are you now? Right now won't work. I'm on the cultural center job. Near you... are there others? Guk Su and a few working ajussis. Then we'll talk again later. Hello? Hello? What did she say? I... perhaps would do like that again. Do like what again? If somebody asks me whether I'm seeing you, Gang Chil, like yesterday, I will say it isn't so. This is just how I am. Unaware of anything but myself. That one week wasn't to think whether to date. If this kind of circumstances were to arise, what would I do? That's what I was thinking. If the people in the town... No, in fact... More importantly, if my father... knew that you, Gang Chil, were an ex-con and were to ask me, would I be able to speak truthfully?... I could say that it was all in the past. That you were framed. And that you have changed now and are a good person. Would I be able to say all that straight up? I thought I couldn't. But then, if we weren't to meet anymore, and I like you, Gang Chil... what would I do? As I was thinking like that... one week passed that I didn't notice. So, that's why yesterday, you said we should do whatever we could with the time at hand... Like we should do it all... As the future is unknown. As usual, I couldn't think through it. And I can't even change the subject. I'm sorry. Ji Na, please listen well to what I am saying. If anyone asks if you're seeing me, like yesterday, say you aren't. In case your father asks, more so, it should be a no. Say you absolutely have no idea, and absolutely don't like me. Like you just said, Miss Ji Na, you should selfishly think of only yourself. You should absolutely not worry, even for a fleeting moment, about a fellow like me. But you really are fearless. How could you, while thinking all that, not run away, but come to me? You are a pea-brain, no? Did you like me that much? It's fine, then. Not telling others that we're in love is no big deal. Is it to tell others about our love that we're in love? Being in love without others knowing... if you think about it, isn't that bad, is it? Thrilling too. Isn't it? If just we both like it, that will do. Right? Over here. There'll just have to be those who know and don't know. I am sorry. Would you make me some ramyeon? After working, I need to shower. Ji Na. Ji Na. Could you help bring me a towel? By the bed, it is in the dresser. Okay, I know. How is this one? I bought this one. -= Yun Mi Hye =- Ji Na. The baby is growing up, no?
