Sir. Uniform number? Uniform Number Victor Seven Three. Agent Lin, you and your men are the best guys I have to transfer Dr James to a secure military base. A breach of the witness protection plan may threaten regional security. Yes, sir. Trust me. De... Devil! - Get down! - Get down! Let's go. - Give it to me. - No, no, no, no. You're the devil. You would have never succeeded without me! Where are the lab records? They're mine! Goodbye. Hello? Although Rick Rogers' latest novel has not yet been published, the copyrights for the movie are already being sought after by Hollywood. Bids for such rights have been coming in at shocking sums. I've had a sneak peek at this book. "She is a mission herself. "Her blood contains all the memories. "One day, she will find her memories back again." Wow! Well, we are very privileged to welcome to the show to talk about his new book, 'Bleeding Steel', Rick Rogers! - Oh, Rick! Oh! - How are you? Oh, I'm very well. Mwah! Welcome to the show. Thank you. Have a seat. So we heard the main character was a US Marine before he died of nuclear radiation, but then some geneticists bought his body and turned him into a bioroid with a mechanical heart. Well, can't keep a secret from you, can I? Oh, there are no secrets in this world. Well, maybe that's so. But many unknown secrets are hidden in my novel, so go buy the book. It's the perfect synergy of body and machine. Ooh, check it out. Stop. Security check. Turn around. Is my kitty here yet? She's on her way, boss. - Next time, it's my turn. - Sure. Come here, kitty. Come to Papa. Excuse me, where are you going? - Who are you? - Shut up! Where did you get the information in your book? Where did you get the information? It was my inspiration. Who are you? What do you want? This is your last chance. Huh? Fuck you! Who are you? How did you get the story in 'Bleeding Steel'? P-P-Please don't kill me. - I bought it. - Where's the original copy? Everything you need is in there. I just stole a story. You shit. Surveillance videos have been uploaded. A team of policemen are on their way to you. - Who's that? - Is that Batman? Popular novelist Rick Rogers has been murdered in what police describe as a robbery gone wrong. We believe the perpetrators of this crime disabled the CCTV cameras in this building. However, we have obtained additional footage from CCTV cameras in the building on the corner. We urge members of public who recognise this man to step forward. We have reason to believe he may been involved in the events that took place tonight. We were attacked by a masked man at Rick's apartment. I'm sorry. He knew a great deal about our bulletproof vests. Where did you get the information in your book? How did you get the story in 'Bleeding Steel'? P-P-Please don't kill me. - I bought it. - Where's the original copy? 13 years you've had me trapped in this sterile cage like an animal. You're gonna suffer everything I've suffered. Sir, we found out about the transvestite. He bought that costume online. We have a shipping address. Go. Do not fail me again. Yes, sir. - One pizza for Leeson. - Thank you. When I find you, I'm gonna kill you. Hi. - Spaghetti? - Yes, please. - Red sauce? - Yeah. And beef soup, right? Thank you, sir. Beef soup for the beautiful young lady. - It's so sparkly! So shiny. - I know! - Sorry. - Bitch. You guys had a conflict, though. Excuse me? What did you say? Sorry, I can't really understand you. - I don't speak Chinglish. - That's a good one. Oops! Have you had a nose job? What? - Argh! - I'm sorry. Back it off, girl. Hey. Go back. Get back. Get back. Nothing to see. Everybody get back. All of you. All of you, guys. Nancy! Nancy! Are you OK? Did you have another nightmare? Drink something. Thank you. Did I wake you again? I'm sorry. Ever since I changed doctors, the nightmares have got worse. Because that's not doctor. She's a witch. She's not a 'witch' witch. She's more like a guide or a spiritualist or something. OK, whatever she is, the dreams are getting worse and clearer. You have them every night. I can't take it anymore. I've lost my weight and I can't sleeping. Please, Nancy, stop going to the witch, or get her fix it. - Yeah. Oh, that's in. - Good shot, bro. Ooh, konnichiwa. Hey, look over! What's your name? Come on, baby. I've been waiting for you for ages. Ooh! Yeah! Whoo! How have you been? The nightmares are more frequent and more vivid. I feel like I've become someone else in my dreams. It takes time to heal. This is stress, my dear. Figments of your imagination, nothing more. But every bit of it feels so real, like I've been there and I know all those people. As if... they are leading me, pushing me to find something. Don't think too much. Relax. One. Two. Three. Doctor, the subject is rejecting multiple organs - they're failing. We're gonna have to give up on this one. Nancy? No. - Nancy? - Help me. Please don't kill me. - Nancy? No. - Don't kill me. If you kill me, nothing can save you. What the fuck? I-I've never seen anything like this before. There's someone else's soul inside you. This is way beyond me now. There's a man. He is a master of hypnosis. He may help. He'll be there tomorrow. Let's see if you can see him. Why did you let her go?! She didn't tell us anything about her dream! The needle broke in half. Rick's dead. I have a feeling the tapes we were selling him got him into trouble. For real! Oh, boys. Ho! See what we have here. I see you come here a lot, looking at that lame witch. What's your name, huh? You can't tell me but you wanna. Really? Now, that's my boy. Aren't you, there? - Let me pass. - Oh! So now you speak English? How about this? Pass under here. I know you like that, huh? Get that bitch. Whoo! Come on, boys. We've got some fresh meat. - Where you going? - Don't be scared. Back off. Back off! - Don't get close. - Oooh. Oops. Feisty one. You can't get away now. Don't! Get him! Ooh! Ahhh! W-wait. Wait, wait. OK. Huh! Ha! Ha! Ha! Hah! Hah! Dok! Dok! Dook! Doo! Oh. Wah! Ah! Ahh-aah! Ow! Ow! Ugh! Ow! Ya! Who you think you are? Jackie Chan? Hey! Ahh! Come on! Get after them! - I think I'm blind. - Don't let that bitch slip away! Stop running! I'll get you! You broke my balls! This way, boys! Let's get 'em! Thank you. You're welcome. Hey. Excuse me, I'm looking for a performer here. A performer? They're in rehearsal right now. The performance is in the evenings. I need to see him right now. It's urgent. I'm sorry, I can't let you in without a permit. - OK, thank you. - OK? OK. So, yeah, two for one. Hi. Hey, guys. Uh, she's my girlfriend. - Can she come in? - Yeah, she'll be right. - Yeah. - Thank you. Hey-hey, baby! OK. My girlfriend. My girlfriend! My girlfriend. My girlfriend! Hi. Hey. - Mohammed Salaami. - Oh. Sorry. Mohammed Salaami? Sal-ah-meh. Yeah, I'm Salaami. Salaami. Salaami. - Salaami! - Good! I'm glad I found you. - W-wh-wh... - I need you to come with me. - Where are we going? - I need you to fix some lights. OK, OK, OK. OK, everybody, let's start rehearsal. Lights, music, get ready. OK, ready? Action. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr Cosentino. Ladies and gentlemen, what you're about to see here tonight is truly extraordinary. My angel has arrived. Come to me. Sit down. You were a fallen angel. But God has given you a second life. I know all your pain. I'll guide you through the darkness to the light, and find the soul that belongs to you. Love is all around you. No! No! Everybody get out! Stop! Don't kill the innocent people. Hey! I got this! You are late. My work here is done. Put your weapons down! Get on the ground! Get him. Kill him. Pick me up at the entrance. You know, you're really starting to piss me off. Give me back my daughter. You want her? She's all yours, Daddy. Ohhh! Oh! Sorry. Yaaah! Yaaaah! Hello? Hello? H... She must be protected. All my work is in her body. Someday she'll be the proof to the world of my contribution to mankind. Oh. Trust me. Hello. All my work is in her body. Every detail is recorded in her blood. She must be protected. Someday she'll be the proof to the world of my contribution to mankind. Ugh! I don't have time for this. Good afternoon. May I help you? Please wait a minute. Thank you. This way, please. No, no, no, no! Bastard! Such superior regeneration ability is attributed to the activation of the regenerative genes from the starfish. Each recombined cell contains the entire genome and fuses to other tissues to rapidly regrow the missing part. The experimental subject is a special force exposed to heavy nuclear radiation. He'll become the first biowarrior in the world if the experiment succeeds. We have developed the first-generation mechanical heart to match the rapid regeneration feature of the bioengineered blood. If the experiment succeeds, the bioroid, with the mechanical heart and the bioengineered blood, will be the immortal warrior of the future. Yes, madam. Hey, boss, they're back. You and I are actually the same. We're lab rats in his little experiments. Ah, the only difference is you didn't get to experience the pain that I've suffered. That sly fox. Hiding his life's work inside of you. And all these years just to find you. I feel like you've turned me into a monster. Diverter initiated. Purification in process. Who are you? Oh... We have the same mechanical heart. But I'm getting eaten alive by my own cells. Thanks to Dr James's blood, not only will I get my powers back but your blood will give me the ability to regenerate. The world's first super biowarrior. My blood contains two sets of memories for 13 years. Those painful memories constantly tortured me day by day. You will have three memories once I pass them on to you. And believe me, you will go insane. No. You see this diverter here? It'll remove all the impurities in your blood. Never again will I experience any more pain. Where's the Asian girl? - In... inside the lab. - Open the door. What are you guys doing? - Nancy. - Where do you think you're going? - Arrgh! - Shaun! Sound the alarm! Get outta here! Go, go, go, go! Nancy! Nancy! Nan... Oh! Nancy. - Nancy. - Nancy! Nancy! Arrgh! - Open it! - Only the boss can do that. - Ugh! - Arrgh! Arrgh! I'm gonna enjoy killing you. Ugh! Ahh! Huh? Yah! Huh? Arrgh! Blood transfusion interrupted. Reverting. Goodbye. Ugh! Oww! Ohh! Arrgh! Ahh! Warning. System malfunctioning. All personnel evacuate. Warning. System malfunctioning. All personnel evacuate. All personnel evacuate. Ahh! Leeson! Leeson! Ugh! I don't have much time left. The bioengineered blood of my biggest success was all given to Xixi. It has superior regeneration capability. Take good care of her. Ugh! Huh? Hi! ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to Nancy ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ Happy birthday, Nancy. Leeson! Leeson! Price is no problem. If you've got for me what you said in email. Hmm? Come over to my office in Moscow. We'll talk. I can send plane to come get you. Hey, man, thanks for openly discussing the price. And I can see right through you. Sorry, I have a dinner date with Jackie Chan later. Over. Fuck! OK. Baba! Cut. Cut. Arrgh! - Action! - Ahh! Ugh! One, two, three! Action! Three, two, one. Action! Keep to your stall. And then back up. Alright, let's do it again. Take three. Roll.
