[upbeat music plays] [people chattering] [foghorn blows] [triumphant heartwarming music plays] [foghorn blows] [wind blowing] [suspenseful music plays] [wolves panting] [barks] [snarls] [music fades] [heartwarming music plays] [wind blows] [music fades] -[passengers chattering] -[foghorn blows] -[man 1] There we go. -[man 2] Real slow. [man 2] Watch it now! Give it some slack. [dog growls] Careful, boy! You could be his breakfast. [dog barks] -Hey, don't do that. -Why not? He's mine. Shipped him all the way from San Francisco. He was a family dog. I'm gonna teach him to fight. Good fightin' dog can make a lot of money up here. Hey, you up here for the gold? You got that right. It's out there just waitin' for somebody to pick it up. These are friends of mine. This here's Luke, Tinker. Didn't get your name. -Jack. -Jack. What's your hurry? You guys ever heard of a man named Alex Larson? -Alex Larson? He's my old pal! -Practically brothers. Beauty here saved Alex's life more than once. Didn't ya, Beauty? -He'd do the same for me. -Back off! You fellas don't really know Alex Larson, do you? What'd I tell ya? You can't fool these city boys. Nah, we don't know him. But we could find him. If he's a gold man, and who ain't up here, he'd be on his way up the Golden Staircase. -Golden staircase? -Chilkoot Pass. About two, three miles outside of town. You'll need help hauling your gear to the top. -I said, back off! -Hey, easy. Sorry. We don't mean to crowd you, boy. -Good luck to you, Jack. -See you later. [both laugh] [horse whinnies] [wagon driver] Yah, come on, now. Yah! Hey! Hey! Hey! -I've been robbed. -Welcome to the Yukon. How high is that golden staircase? About a mile, but it'll seem like more. Yeah, well, I can make it up that far. [dramatic music plays] [calming music plays] Hey, I'll sell you a map of a place where there's gold. [guide] Keep moving, you men! [prospectors chattering] [adventurous music plays] [chattering continues] Kid, move it! [Jack grunting] [music fades] [dogs barking] Hey, do you know where I can find Alex Larson? Yeah. Over there. [breathes heavily] Are you Alex Larson? Depends who's asking. I sent you a letter. Anybody who knows me knows I can't read, so they don't write. Anybody who writes me, I figure I don't know him. Well, I'm Jack, Scott Conroy's son. I'm looking for somebody to take me to my father's claim. -Who's in there? -Name's Dutch. [Jack grunts] [Jack] My father sent me his maps before he died. And he sent something else. He sent me gold. There was gold dust in the envelope. If you take me out to his claim, I'll cut you in. -What's so funny? -Everybody finds a little gold dust. That's what keeps you digging. But you have to strike it. And your father didn't. Go home and find a regular job. You wouldn't last a day out here. I'm a good worker and I just want what's mine. I'm asking you to give me a chance. -Skunker. -Damn, what is it? Alex, I was dreamin' you, me and Dutch was livin' it up in Frisco. Get the dogs ready. I hope Dutch appreciates this ride. 'Cause you should've died at your digs! And saved us a trip back. Are you going near my father's claim? Scott Conroy's boy. What? Let me see that face, kid. Look at me. My God, Alex, he's the spittin' image of his old man. -I knew your pa well. Clarence Thurston. -Jack Conroy. -You throwin' in with us? -Yeah, I'd like to. [Alex] No. "No"? "No"? You're taking him and you're not gonna take me? -He looks half dead already! -Hey! I'm s-- No offense. Give me a stick of that gum, and I'll forgive ya. It's hard to get it up here and it makes my breath smell real fresh. Yeah. Hey, don't worry about him. He's just tired, that's all. Yeah, or he knows there's gold there and wants it for himself. Whoa, boy! You got the harness on the wrong dog. Listen, if you don't want to take me, I'll go by myself. I'll get rich by myself too. I think he's crazy enough to do it, Alex. You know he doesn't stand a chance. Come on, Alex. He's Scott's boy! Look at him! Huh? How much trouble could he be? All right. I'll take you as far as Klondike. Fall behind, and I'll leave you where you drop. -Understand? -Yes, sir. I'm going to regret this. Nah, Alex. [soothing music plays] [mystical music plays] [Skunker] Pull, Digger. Come on, boy! Attaboy, Digger. Pull! Mush, mush. Come on, boys. Come on, boys. Good boy, good boy. [triumphant music plays] [Skunker] Whoa. Alex? I got a loose harness on Blue. [Skunker] Okay, mush! [dogs bark] Come on, Fritz. Attaboy. Mush! [soothing music plays] [wolf pup cries] [whines] [whimpers] [cries] [music fades] [Skunker] Pull, Digger. Come on, boy. Attaboy, Digger. Pull! Mush, mush! Come on, boys. [Skunker] Whoa! -Are you all right, kid? -I saw something. In the woods. Wolves. They've been trailing us for a couple hours now. Game's scarce. They must be starving. Think they're after us? The dogs. Wolves won't jump a man, unless hunger's got them totally crazed. [gunshot] -Let's get going. -Brrr! Wolves be the devil on earth. Kid, give me a piece of that gum again, will ya? It calms me. I'll carry it for ya, okay? Come on! Mush, Digger. [Digger whines] Mush! Come on, boys, pull! Mush. Let's go. [dog barks] [ominous music plays] Mush. Come on, pull, buddy. Quit playing around. [music fades] Mmm-hmm. Got that tarp a little close to the fire, don't you? I don't want to freeze to death. [wind blowing] What's he doing? Cleaning his teeth. How'd they get dirty? Oh, Jeez! Watch it! [Skunker] Whoops. Yeah, I know it's a little fishy, but you can put your head at the other end. [laughs] I told you, too close to the fire. [Skunker chuckles] Nice weather. -What are you doing? -Only things my dogs drag are things we need. That's my property! You want 'em? -You carry 'em! -Hold it, hold it, hold it. I'm gonna feed the dogs, fellas. You're not gonna kill each other while I'm gone, are ya? We'll wait till you come back. [Skunker laughs] Oh, boy, here comes the fishies. They smell good too. You guys know who loves you. Here you go. [dogs bark] And here's some fish for you, Fatty. Ow! Don't bite the hand that feeds ya. [Alex plays mouth harp] Seven pieces of fish for seven dogs, and you didn't get any. What are you mumbling about? I had seven fish for seven dogs, and Digger didn't get fed. I swear there was a wolf in with the dogs! And I fed the damn thing! How would a wolf get in with the dogs? He's dreaming again. [mystical music plays] [howling] [ominous music plays] Relax. The fire's going. They will keep their distance. Alex, I ever tell you my uncle was a wolfer down in Montana? When I was little, he used to lower me in the hole, and have me shoot the cub puppies for the bounty. I hated doing that. Get some sleep, Skunker. [Alex panting] [barks] [dogs pant] Whoa! [Jack] Whoa. -[Jack] We gonna go around? -[Skunker] Nah, the dogs can handle that. Just go slowly and stay to the left. Help me balance this. Come on. -[dog whines] -[Skunker groans] [Alex] Let's keep it nice and slow. Oh, oh! Easy! Oh! Whoa. [dogs whine, bark] [dramatic music plays] -My books! -[Skunker] Damn it, kid, forget the books! Look out! [Jack screams] Hang on, kid. I gotcha. Hold on. Stand up. Dig your feet in. Just stand up. Get your feet up. Come on! I got to get the rope untangled. Stay. Come on, Jack. You can do it, kid. Come on, reach up there! Kick clear! Kick clear of the sled, Jack. [grunts] [screams] [screams] [grunts] [screaming] [grunts] Whoa! [music fades] [wind blows] Jack, stay right there! Don't move on that ice! Don't move. [faintly] Jack! [Jack] I'll get the ammo. [Skunker] [faintly] Jack! Jack! [ice cracking] [screams] [suspenseful music plays] Hurry up! Help me. [Jack] Help! I told you not to move. Help! Hold on. Hold on! Help me! -All right. -Take this rope! Come on, kid. Attaboy. [Jack screams] [Alex] Jack, get these clothes off. That's it. Keep moving. Take it easy. [Skunker] Attaboy. Get this off and I'll get the blanket. He's turning blue. [Alex] We'll get you warm soon enough. [Alex] Get a fire going before he freezes to death. Hurry up! Take your shirt off. Help me. [Jack breathes heavily] It's gonna be too wet. Come on! -Keep moving. That's it. -[Jack coughing] Books! Keep moving! That's it. That's it. Come on. Now we're cookin'. Yeah, it's going. -Come here! -Come on, get him over here, Alex. [Alex] There. Sit down there, boy. -[Skunker] Put your hands under your arms. -Keep your fingers moving. Let's get the rest of these wet clothes off. [Skunker] That's starting to feel good, huh? [Jack] I'm sorry, Alex. I was trying to get the ammo. And I-- [Alex] Stop talking and drink this. Drink it. It's pine-needle tea. It tastes like hell but it keeps the heart pumping. [Alex sighs] I'll get Dutch. What's left? Three cartridges. Damn. It's like being naked out here. "He's Scott's boy." [scoffs] "How much trouble could he be?" [whines] [wolf howling] We've got company. Shield the firelight from your eye. Look hard. Let's get the dogs safe. -[Alex] George, Digger. -Fritz, Fatty. -[Alex] Settle down. Settle down. -Come here. Get down in there. [Skunker] Get down in there. [whimpers] Look! [dog whines] [Skunker] It's a female, Alex! That bitch is part dog. [Alex] That's why she isn't afraid of the fire. [Skunker] She's a decoy. She draws the dogs out so the pack can eat them. -[Digger whines, barks] -Digger, come back here! Digger! [Alex] Digger! Damn! Come back! Damn you, Digger, come back or I'm gonna whup you! -[Digger barking] -Digger! Come back here! Digger. Digger, come here! Damn you! Don't be fooled! Get over here! [Digger growls, whines] Digger. Come back! Digger! Digger. I know where one of these bullets is goin'. -[Alex] Hey! Are you crazy? -He's my best dog! Skunker! Skunker, come back! Digger, get out of the way! Don't waste the bullets! My God. Digger! -Digger, come back. -Skunker! [Alex] Stay put! -Skunker! -Digger! [Alex] They are right behind you! -[Skunker] Come back here! -[wolf growls] -Skunker! -[growling] [melancholic music plays] [gunshot] [gunshot] -[Skunker screams] -[growling] [whines] He's gone. Nothing we can do. [music fades] [whimpering] [dogs whimpering, whining] [shushes] Sorry, Skunker. We didn't have a chance to say goodbye. Go to sleep. [mystical music plays] [wolf howling] [dramatic music plays] Help me. Come on! [growling] [barks] [music fades] [wind blows] Let's pack up. -[growling] -[screaming] [suspenseful music plays] -[gunshots] -[music stops] [dogs barking] Hey, you all right? Yes. But how did you find us? Saw the smoke from your fire. Thank God. You saved our lives. [ominous music plays] [whimpering] [melancholic music plays] [whimpers] [breathes raggedly] [breathing stops] [wind blows] [mystical music plays] [howling] [music fades] [adventurous music plays] [whimpers] [whimpers] [whimpers] [melancholic music plays] [wind blows] [adventurous music continues] [Alex grunting] [yelps] [mystical music plays] [whimpers] [music fades] [whistles] [whistles] [whimpers] [dogs barking] What chance would a wolf cub have of surviving on his own out here? None without the pack. [calming music plays] [barks] [whimpers] [whining] [barks] [barks] [whimpers] [whining] [barks] [mice squeaking] [fast-paced music plays] [music stops] [whimpering] [calming music plays] [suspenseful music plays] [music stops] [whimpering] [wind blows] [Jack] Come on, come on. Whoa. Is there any good reason why we can't just bury him here? I don't think he'll know the difference. I gave him my word. Okay! -Okay. -[dogs barking] [whimpering] [bells jingling] [heart beating] [whining] [dog whines] [speaking Athabaskan] [dogs barking] [heartbeats stop] [speaking Athabaskan continues] Look... the white fang. [whimpers] This wolf is part dog. [whimpering] [speaking Athabaskan] -[dogs pant] -[cub whines and yaps] [speaking Athabaskan] [whimpers, barks] [speaking Athabaskan] [cub barks, whimpers] I'm glad Dutch is dead, 'cause I'm ready to kill him. [Alex] Whoa, whoa! [dogs bark] Look, you old weasel! Look at that! You're home! You're home now! Home! Okay, okay! Come on! Let's move out. Klondike is still a good two days away. You gonna say anything? You know what? What? I never really liked the bastard. -[boy] Come, come. Come here. -[speaking Athabaskan] -Come here. Good, good. -[man laughs] Over here. [calming music plays] Looks like he's gonna be a good working dog. -[townspeople chattering] -[man 3] Over here. Come on. [donkey brays] -[Alex] Come on. -[man 4] Okay, Harry. -Hi, Joe. -Hi, Alex. -Take good care of them. Okay? -Sure will. What are you going to do for money? Well, I got fifty bucks in my boot. You'll be all right. You can get a dry bed and breakfast at the edge of town. -Tell Dave I sent you. -Okay. He'll give you a good rate. Okay. Where are you going? To see a friend. -Okay. -Listen... -get yourself a partner. -Yeah, sure. Don't go off on your own. Hey, don't worry about me. Good luck. Thanks. [old man 1] Okay, do I look all right? [upbeat music plays] [girl laughs] Keep your hands to yourself! [tavern man] Heather, sit on my lap and give me a kiss. Shut up, Clyde, I'm working. In pants. Why don't you put on a pretty dress for us? 'Cause I couldn't do this. Whoa! [Clyde] Don't you love me anymore, Heather? [woman 1] Good for her. It's a miracle how beautiful you really are. Oh. Who's that? He's Scott Conroy's son. I brought him up here. How remarkable. -He even looks like Scott. -Mmm-hmm. -Belinda Casey. -Jack Conroy. Hello. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. Do you work here? -I own the place. -Oh, great. Would you like a drink? Yeah, I'd love one. Shouldn't you be at Bradford's? Yeah. A pleasure meeting you. Bye, Alex. Bye. [men chattering] [old man 2] Three more! [townspeople chattering] [driver] Coming through! -[chattering continues] -[woman 2] Joshua! Miss Casey! -Oh, Jack, hi. -Hi. -How are you? Can I get that for you? -I'm well. Yes, you certainly can. -Got it? -Yeah. How'd you make out? Did you find some place to stay? -Yeah, I did. -Uh-huh. [Belinda] Do you know anybody else here? -Just you and Alex. -Would you like to join us for dinner? -Yeah, I'd love to. -Good. -Come by in an hour. -Okay. You heard they made Alcatraz into a prison, didn't you? No. When I lived there, it was used for immigration, I think. Not anymore. Now they've got federal prisoners there, soldiers that deserted during the war, and some of the Indians from Arizona. Indians? Oh, that's horrible. I'll get some dessert. -Would you like some coffee? -No, thank you. Get out of here. Now. Take me where I want to go. No. Then I'm staying. I'll think about it... if you get out of here in two seconds. -You're not leaving? -Yes, ma'am. Thank you for dinner. It was delicious. Can I borrow that book? I promise I'll return it. Good night, Alex. Good night. You know, I think he really likes you. And how about you, my dear Belinda? [townspeople chattering] [man 5] He said, "If I could walk that way, I wouldn't need the talcum powder." [thunder rumbling] [scraping] The lines are wrong. What makes you the expert? Experience. It'll be hard for us to control. Does that mean we're partners? It means that I will take you to your father's mine. That's all it means. Oy-yoy. [mystical music plays] [townspeople chattering] [music fades] [Alex] I'll miss you. I'll miss you too. Next year we'll have that hotel in San Francisco. Come on, Alex, kiss her. I won't look. This time. You'll see. -See ya! -[Belinda] Bye! Belinda! Feed the dogs. Boy, you're a romantic, aren't you? [triumphant heartwarming music plays] [birds squawking] [people speaking Athabaskan] Who are they, Alex? They are Han Indians. I know the chief of this tribe. We'll stop here for the night. [villagers chattering] We've come to see Grey Beaver. [music fades] Good to see you, my friend. And you. It's been a long time. Jack, this is Grey Beaver. [speaking Athabaskan] [Alex] The boat is taking water. We have to re-tar it. Fine. [calming music plays] What's his name? Mia Tuk. What does that mean? White Fang. Hi, Mia Tuk. Can I pet you? -No. -I just wanted to pet him. Dogs are for work. Maybe they'd work harder if you were more friendly. We make fire. Kill with sticks. Cause stones to fly. We are their gods. That is why they obey. Not because we're friends. Mia Tuk. [dogs barking] [growling] [people speaking Athabaskan] You boys want a stick of gum? Well, here you go. Thank you very much for dinner. It was very good. [speaking Athabaskan] [Jack] I can't sleep when it doesn't get dark. You'll get used to it. -[frogs croaking] -[wolves howling] They never let you forget. [howling] [Jack] Listen, it's not food. You're supposed to chew it, not swallow it. All right? [villagers chattering] [girls chattering, laughing] [calming music plays] [dramatic music plays] [screams] [screams] [screams] [growling] [growls] [bear growls] [White Fang growls] [music fades slowly] [people speaking Athabaskan] [village man calling in Athabaskan] I won't forget you. [Jack] Thank you so much. [Alex grunts] [Grey Bear speaking Athabaskan] [calming music plays] [adventurous music fades in] You're here. Your father wanted to be buried on the claim. [music fades] When I was younger, I used to think he was a hero. My mother would tell me stories about where he was and what he was doing. I never knew what was true. He said he wanted to give us a better life. All we wanted was for him to stay. What took you so long getting up here? It's been a year. My mother got sick. She pull through? Nah. Sorry. I know you want to keep moving, but I've got to try it here, settle in here. The gold is further north. Why don't you try it here, Alex? There must be gold here, and I know we can find it. It's not a bad spot. I'll get you started. [calming music plays] -[music fades] -[townspeople chattering] Holy biscuits! Look at that dog! That ain't no dog, you idiot. That's a wolf. Come on. Let's go! Take him down there. Let's see what happens. All right, come on. [growling] Go get him! Go on! [White Fang snarling] [dog whining] Damn! I want that animal. -[White Fang growls] -Get Buck out of there. Buck! Buck, easy, boy. Easy, Buck. Get back. Sorry. I'm overstocked as it is. -[Beauty] Down, boy. Sit. -[White Fang barking] -Sit! Easy. -[growls] Mia Tuk, no! [speaking Athabaskan] Is he yours? Look what your wolf done to my dog here. Who's gonna pay for the damages? You know it's illegal to bring wolves into town? Luke... go find us a Mountie. He'll straighten this out. Wait. Here. -Not interested in furs, Chief. -[White Fang growling] But I'll take that wolf off your hands. No, it's not for sale. That's too damn bad, 'cause now you're gonna spend some time in jail. Go find him, Luke. [Grey Beaver] No! How much? You know something, Chief? You're shrewd. Come on! This wolf's gonna make us a lot of money. Get in! [whines] [laughs] Looks like he's takin' to the place. [whining] Come on. I'll buy you a drink. [barks] [triumphant music plays] [Tinker] I don't believe it! Hey, wolf. Hey, wolf. Show those teeth. Go! [music fades] [water dripping] [rumbling] [coughs] My hands hurt. My head hurts. My feet hurt. Let's get some dynamite and blow the whole damn mountain up. Huh? What do you say? That would be too easy. What's the story in that one? It's about this man who-- He builds a machine that takes him into the future. I can teach you to read. You teach me to read, I'll make you a miner. Deal. [White Fang growling] All right, wolf. Let's see what you've got. Come on, wolf! Come on! That's it! Come on, wolf. Yeah! Come on, wolf! Hold him! Come on, wolf! Come on. Come on! Come on, let's see what you've got. Come on! Come on, wolf! Come on, wolf. There you go. That's it, that's it! Yeah, yeah! Ow! Oh. I think he's ready. -[spectators chattering] -[dogs barking] Wolf, don't you let me down. Get mad! Come on! Get mad! Get in there and kill him. You understand? Come on! [heart beating] Come on. Come on. -[whines] -Come on, get mean. Let's get mad. Come on! Let's get him! [heartbeats stop] Get over here. Come on! Gentlemen, on three. One, two, three! -[barking] -[men cheering] Tear him up, wolf. Tear him up! Get in there! Get in there, wolf! Yes! [White Fang whimpering] Come on, come on! Come on, wolf. You did good. It's a pleasure taking your money, Sykes. I'll be back, Smith. Next time bring a live dog. [whining] Okay, wolf, come on, I want you to get mad. I want you to get in there and win, understand me? All right, on three. One, two, three! Come on, quick! Quick! Yeah! Yes. One, two... three! [whining] [footsteps] -[growls] -Easy, boy. You done good tonight. I brought you something extra. Take it easy. Here you go. You just keep on hatin' me, wolf. [whining] [Alex] "It took days for the boys to reach the secluded... hideaway. No one had set foot into the housie--" -House. -"For years--" -House. Not "housie," house. -House. -House. -House. "For years, when the door was finally opened and..." Uh... "the fou-- fo--" "Foul"? Like the birds? No, no. "Foul" like the birds is "F-O-W-L." This is "F-O-U-L." Foul. Like a bad smell. Like rotten. Like your socks smell foul. I wash them. Yeah, well, use some soap, would ya? If you'd spend as much time digging as you do washing-- I do more than my share around here. That's a laugh. Who do you think does all the cooking? You do. You definitely do. And with the way you cook, -I'm lucky to still be alive. -Then do your own damn cooking! I'm not your wife! Yeah, that's for sure. You're too damn ugly. That's U-G-L-Y. Maybe we ought to head into town tomorrow. We need supplies anyway. Good idea. [spectator 1] I tell you, that dog's unbeatable. -Unbeatable! -[growling] Get away from that cage! Get him away there, Tinker! -Get back! -You want your hand, buddy? Mr. Sykes. [man 6] Step aside, gentlemen. What have you brought for us today? [growling] Where's the rest of him? -That's a bulldog. -He's pretty. They're killers, you moron. -Look at them jaws! -Shut up! It's Cherokee. I've seen him fight. Your dog's unbeatable, right? I've got 5,000 that says he won't be after today. What's the matter, Smith? Too rich for your blood? Let's do it. [townspeople chattering] [Luke] Gentlemen, on three. One, two, three! Get him! Get him! Come on, wolf! [sound fades] [ominous melancholic music plays] [White Fang snarling] -[spectator 2] Cherokee! -[spectator 3] Wolf! -[spectator 4] Wolf! -[spectator 5] Cherokee! -[spectator 6] Come on! -[spectator 7] Come on. [heart beating] [spectator 8] Aw! Damn! -[heartbeats stop] -[sound fades in] [spectator 9] Flip him over! Come on, wolf. Get up, get up! Come on! Kill him! Get up! Hey, that's White Fang. -Get up, wolf! -[Alex] Stay out of this. It's over. Not yet it ain't. Come on, wolf. Get up and fight! Will somebody give me a hand here? -Get this dog off of him. -[man 7] I'll help you, son. I got him. [man 7] Let go of him. Don't break those teeth! [man 7] Let go, dog. -Mounties! Mounties! -[men shouting] [Beauty] Hey, kid! Hey! Kid, that's my wolf! [Jack] He was. I paid for him when you robbed me in Skagway. Remember me? Oh, yeah? Easy. You stay. Hey, you two, keep an eye out for me. -This ain't finished yet! -[escapee 1] Come on, let's go! [escapee 2] Don't let 'em see ya! [whimpering] [Belinda sighs] He's lost a lot of blood. At least he won't have to fight anymore. [Belinda sighs] Good night, Jack. [somber music plays] [whimpering] -[music fades] -[panting] [White Fang whimpers] [Alex] I remember the good old days when dogs used to pull men. [Jack] He needs to be in the cabin so I can take care of him. I'm not sleeping in the same room with a wolf. [crickets chirping] -[growls] -You're wasting your time. He was tame once. You saw him. He was. He's not anymore. [whimpering] Don't give up on me, you hear? [water running] Congratulations. You've got a healthy wolf on your hands. Now get him outside. I can't do that by myself. Hold out a piece of meat. I'll unhook him. [ominous music plays] [growling] Look at him watching my hand. They beat him bad. There is no taming him now. He was taught to hate. All he needs is a little bit of kindness. [growling] Try it without the wood. You try it without the wood. [growling] [whispering] Easy. Easy... [growling] Okay, okay... Are you crazy? No, I know what I'm doing. I hope. Just gonna untangle this. Here we go. [Alex] Turn him loose. He belongs in the woods. I know you don't want to hurt me. But you're right. I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have tried to force you. I don't know what they did to you, but everybody's not like that. I promise. It's gonna be all right. So you come on out when you're ready. [Jack breathes heavily] You forgot something. Just wait. Now what? [birds singing] You hungry, boy? Yeah, of course you're hungry. You're always hungry. Where you going? Looks pretty good, huh? Hey, White Fang. Hey. See, that was pretty good, huh? Hey, hey! It's not so bad, huh? Want a little more, maybe? Hey, hey. Come on, boy. [soothing music plays] It's not so bad. I'm a pretty nice guy. Maybe a little more? Hey. Come on. Hey! White Fang, hey, look at this. A little more, maybe? Hey, hey! Come on, boy. It's okay. Yeah, not so bad. Don't tell me you're not hungry. Here you go. Moving slow. Come here. Huh? Huh? Huh? I'm sorry. Huh? A little more? Here you go. I ain't gonna hurt you. Yeah, not so bad. Not so bad. It's all right. It's all right. We're gonna be okay. -[Jack] Hey, hey, hey! -[growling, snapping] [Jack exclaims] That fool. Watch out! Put the rifle down! Put it down! He won't hurt me. See? [heartwarming music plays] You scared the hell out of me. I told you he was intelligent. All right, come on! Come on! [playful shouts] [playful shouts] Up! Come on, get it. Here. Come get it. Oh! Oh, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, get back here. [music fades] I'm gonna go back in and get one more load. Don't. It's late. Come on, boy. [rumbling] Jack! Jack! [whimpering] -Jack? -[muffled] Alex, help! [whines] -Jack? -[muffled] Alex, Alex! Hey, buddy. [White Fang whines] [birds singing] -Are you all right? -[sighs] The sky never looked so blue. No, it can't be... What? Holy mackerel! We're rich. Aren't we? It's just like we dreamed of. It's gold, all right. If the quality is bad, it won't be worth much. No sense getting crazy... just yet. You're sure you don't want to take him with you? No. There'll be too many people. Okay. Bye-bye. -[whimpering] -[Alex] Listen... Don't get caught up in anything there. Just get in, get it tested, and get back here. As soon as I can. What are you going to do without me? I'll yell at the wolf. I guess he's coming with me. I'll pick up a new window. [townspeople chattering] How you doing? I'd like to have this tested. I'm on claim number seven, right below Discovery on Blue Creek. [assayer] I assume you want to deposit this with our bank. [Jack] Yes. You assume correct. What is it, huh? I hope he's been fed. Here it is. Fee and deposit paid for by Scott Conroy, in his name and his son's. -You Jack Conroy? -Yeah, that's me. I'd also like you to add Alex, uh... Alexander Larson's name to that. It's your gold. [Belinda] Oh, he's completely recovered! All right, we got to get going. But you just got here, Jack. Well, we've got some things to do. All right, don't forget what you came for. Oh! Right. -Come on, White Fang. -Take care, Jack. Be careful. -[Jack] I will. Bye-bye. -Come on. What did they say? Who? The assayer, who else? What's wrong with you? Well, read for yourself. "The... quality... of gold found at the claim of Jack Conroy and Alexander--" "...Larson, tested and weighed by the assayer at Klondike City on the 11th day of August, 1898, is found to be 98% pure." We're rich. We are rich! [triumphant music plays] Very rich. That's what the guy says. The guy says, "very rich." He says we are filthy, stinkin' rich! [ominous music plays] [music fades] [Jack whoops] [Jack chuckling] While you were gone, I did some thinking. I'd like you to come back with us to San Francisco... to be part owner of our hotel. So what do you think? I think it sounds like a good idea. I'll name it after your father, the Royal Scott Hotel. To your father. Good friend. Dream on, boys. [Beauty sighs] [footsteps] There's something on the roof. [gunshot] You must have been followed. -I was careful, Alex. I did what you-- -[gunshots] White Fang, get under here. Come on! [Alex] They stuffed the pipe! Stay down! Put this over your head. It will help you breathe. They can't stay in there much longer. Hold your fire till they come out. Maybe they're dead. [mouth harp playing] That's "Coming 'Round the Mountain," ain't it? I hate that song. That'll keep them guessing. [playing continues] They ain't takin' the hint. Let's move in. Get in there, Tinker. Well, earn your keep! [dramatic music plays] [screams] [grunts] [screams] [White Fang growling] [Beauty] Get him off of me! Hey! -[Beauty yells] -Easy, easy, easy. Easy, easy. -[prospector 1] Hey. -[old man 3] Hi there. [old man 3] Look at him. [prospector 2] Will you look at this now. -[prospector 3] Hey, sorry! -[prospector laughs] [prospector 4] Had it coming, boys! -Go get us the Mounties, would ya? -[boy 1] Yes, sir! -[prospector 4] Ya had it coming! -[boy 2] Hey, wait up! Come on, everybody. Free drinks! -Come on in. -[patron 1] Free drinks? [patrons chattering] [Heather] Free drinks on Alex Larson. [patron 2] Don't ask me twice. -[patron 3] Come on! Here we go! -[patron 4] Don't shove now! [music plays in saloon] [patron 5] Bring another keg of beer. If we are going to catch that boat in Skagway, we've got to leave soon. You know you can't take him with you. He'd be miserable in the city. He has to run free. That's his magic. He thinks you are a wolf. [melancholic music plays] [birds singing] [sighs] [softly] Come here. [softly] All right. Take care of yourself, all right? All right, go on. You're free. Go on. Go on. Get outta here! Listen to me. Go, go! Go! Go. Go on! Go! Listen to me. Go! -[whines] -Get outta here. Go! Go on! -[whines] -Get outta here. [whimpers] Go on! [sweeping music plays] [panting] [townspeople chattering] Oh, here he is, Alex. Where's the wolf? I let him go. [Belinda] Bye, Heather. -Don't let them get away with anything. -I won't. [Heather] Goodbye! [foghorn blows] I can't believe this is actually happening. Alex, I gotta tell you something. I'm not-- I can't leave. Not yet. I'm gonna go back to the claim. [adventurous music plays] Miss Casey. So long. Your father would be proud of you. -I'll keep an eye on your gold for you. -Yeah, you better. -And leave a room open for me. -I have to. You're part owner. [woman 3] Bye! Bye! [foghorn blows] [whistles] [thunder rumbles] [joyful music plays] White Fang! [triumphant heartwarming music plays] [laughs] [music swells] [music fades] [adventurous music plays] [music fades]
