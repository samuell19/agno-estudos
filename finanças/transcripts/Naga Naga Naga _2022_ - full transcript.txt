I want those flowers now. My men will be reaching there soon. I'm on it, Mr. Bonaga. Park in the usual spot, do you understand? Quickly. How could you neglect your wife? Hey, Mon. You act like you don't have a husband. Get your suitcase, Bon. There it is. - How come you're late? - There was traffic, sir. - And you, Vino? - It's the traffic too, sir. Nice, you both are in sync. Here you go. For me? I'm surprised that you're so romantic. Starting from now... ...I will always bring you flowers. Until the end of time. If loving you is worship... ...then giving you flowers is prayer. Which I will do every day. Please accept this. I'm getting dizzy... ...I can't stand hearing it. For my lover, Elisabeth. Bonaga, honey. My name is Monita. Not Elisabeth. Elisabeth? Why didn't you take this off? You only told us to get the flowers, sir. Give it to your wife. Bon! Give me my bag. - Take care of the car. - Yes, sir. Are they really quarrelling or what? Maybe we should get rich first... ...to understand. Naga! Naga! Monaga! I never told Monaga to play soccer. It is our child's choice. But should our daughter play soccer, Bon? Who knows, through women's soccer... ...Indonesia can be a world champion? What is she looking for in soccer? Maybe now she is playing for fun. Later she can learn... ...how to make money. Monaga! Monaga! Soccer is a contact sport, Bon. It's not right for a girl. Life is tough, Mon. Let her make her own life choices. Because life is tough... ...a woman comes to soften it. Maybe Monaga would like... ...to taste how tough life is. So that she can find out how to soften it. You can keep standing up for her. Monaga! Monaga! - You did it twice. - Hey, Monaga. If you're a crybaby, don't play soccer! Just play with dolls. Soccer is a tough sport! Not hard enough? Stand up! Stand up! Last call. I'm leaving. I've bought you flowers and paid for your coffee. Are you still going to Surabaya? I'm going to Surabaya. You go to Medan and pick Monaga up. Next week the school starts. Hey, Mon... What if Monaga asks... ...why you didn't come? Please tell Monaga... ...that I love her so much. Mom. I have learnt how to pray. I have sent many Fatihah prayers for you. Tears have rolled down my face... ...regretting my faults... ...which had angered you all the time. I long to hear your scolding. But when I die... ...don't scold me in front of God. Okay? I will be ashamed. Or I will burn in hell, mom. Yes, yes, yes? Siti Maimunah daughter of Syaifullah Kirana daughter of Zulmi Kirana, my wife. If this is a nail... ...it must be a special nail. It's a sharp nail driven deeply. Rusted by time. People say it's longing... ...but not any kind of longing. I cannot hold it much more. I no longer have you now. I am praying all the time... ...for the angels in Heaven accompanying me there... ...will all look like you, Kirana. All of them. Bujang son of Fulan Bujang. If only you were alive. You could have seen my grandchild, Monaga. She is so pretty. She looks like her grandmother, Kirana. But when she talks... Her mouth is like... She is like my mother. Hey! If it were the governor... ...who stepped on your grave. I would have hit his head. But it is my grandchild, Bujang. How could I get angry at her? I am your only grandchild... ...so you should love me. Do you hear that? That is an order. You have to go back to Jakarta. Go to school. So you can be smart. There are so many smart people. But not many right people. In order to be right, you have to study. Why school? School is the place to study. - I can learn anywhere. - Right. But the school building has already been built. If it's not used, what is it for? A horse stable? All I know is, the Prophet and his disciples didn't go to school. But they became good and worthy people. But you are not a prophet, Monaga. Right, but we have to follow their examples, right? Hey, listen to me first. Monaga! When you talk... ...you're just like my mother. You only want others to listen to you. Rusli! Bonaga! You're looking good, man! Thank you for helping around. Rusli, how many kids do you have now? If you count the one that was born last month... ...five kids. You're great! Five... ...but all of them are girls. I have two wives now... ...but my kids are all girls. What's so great about it? Maybe I tought to have another wife. A white woman. Bonaga! General Naga. A great man. It's a pity he doesn't have a grandson. But Monaga is good at soccer. Dad. Thank you. Don't you want to have a son? Why? It is said that for the Batak people... ...the family surname is inherited to the son. Bonaga is a Batak, right? In this era of gender equality... ...does that custom still apply? That is how we think... ...but the reality is different. You still have that bad habit, Dad. Picpocketting. I'm training... ...for times when it may be needed. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too. You smell of sweat. Take a bath now! I will kiss you later. You're so stingy. It is not strong enough. You have no strength, young man. How can this country move forward? I don't feel it. Really? The time is near. What time? Time to face your Maker. Do you want me to die soon? I am just reminding you. Talking to an old person like you... ...the topic... ...is always about death, right? How could you? Are you ready? Ready for what? To die. That will need some serious preparations. You are not romantic at all. Young people, old people. Men, women. Rich, poor. Everybody will die. I know that. What else now? With the help of this foot... ...I became a successful person. But this foot has now become numb. I am lucky to have you. I see you could be romantic as well. Where did you learn it from? Silent, please. Let me finish, dad. I forgot what I wanted to say. I am lucky to have you. That's what you said. What are you trying to say? Thank you. And then? That's all. Is that all? Yes. Don't cry, Bonaga. Why? If you cry, I will too. Two Nagas are crying. What will the world say? We are just like girls. I am a girl but I don’t like crying. Grandpa. Who is kinder? Grandma... ...or my mom? Both are special women. Your mom... ...gave birth, took care, and raised you with her love. Your grandma... ...had to lose her life... ...when she gave birth to your dad. Did you love grandma? Very much. Do you love my dad? Very much. Do you love my mom? Very much. Do you love me? Very much. Very much. Very much. Really? I will sacrifice anything... ...for your happiness, my grandchild. Anything. Watch out for the bishop. Think again, dad. I have thought about it over and over. You are alone here... ...with only Rusli as your company. He already helps with the plantation's administration. How can you take care of Monaga? Without Rusli... ...I raised you... ...until you graduated from college. You are getting older. Your feet are getting stiffer. I am ashamed... ...if you also have to take care of Monaga here. You and Monita... ...are too busy in Jakarta. Let Monaga go to school here. The son of Major Lukman... ...is now the headmaster. I will talk to him. Dad, Monita sent me here... ...to pick up Monaga. What will I say to Monita... ...if Monaga doesn't want to come home? If so, let me talk to Monita. You call her. - No, don't. - Why? Save your bishop first. It is in danger. We will talk about Monaga later. Bonaga. If I corner your king until check mate... ...will you let Monaga study here? Dad, it's hard for me... ...to stay away from Monaga... ...let alone for Monita. In that case, let's ask Monaga... ...what she wants. Check. How can that be? Anything can happen, right? Where is my knight that was here? It said it wants to sleep here. How could you, dad? Grandpa, dad. Please try this, I made boiled cassava. Please. How is it? This is the tastiest cassava in the world. Grandpa? If you didn't tell me it's cassava... ...I would have thought that it is cheese. Monaga. Your dad wants to ask you something. What is it about? You ask her, dad. You ask her. My feet are getting stiff... ...and I am getting speechless. Ask her, I want to know the answer. You want to ask me about school, right? I want to ask about... I want to ask about... How did you cook this? It's very tasty. You are so funny. I boiled it, simple as that. Add a little salt and that's it. Your dad has been funny since he was a kid. It's like looking for a snake's armpits. Mon. Dad is coming to Jakarta. Really? Monaga asked dad to come. When we asked him, he declined. It's alright. Please get him a ticket, okay? What's up, Mon? It looks like I have to return to Jakarta. Are you mad? The minister is coming to the seminar this afternoon... ...because of your invitation. I'm sorry, I have to prepare for the arrival of someone... ...who has a higher rank than the minister. - The President? - Higher. Who? My father in law. Give him a grandson so he'll give in. Mom. I will miss you. I will pray for you as much as I can. Let's go, dad. Or we'll miss the flight. I need a little time... ...to say goodbye, Bonaga. Kirana, my wife. If this is a nail... ...it can't just be any nail. Come on dad, don't play with words. We will be late. Just say it directly. How do you say it directly? Mom, we are taking dad to Jakarta, alright? Stop it. You are not romantic at all. Grandpa Bujang, grandma, and my beloved great grandma. I am taking grandpa to Jakarta, alright? Uncle Rusli will take care of things here. I'm sorry. You don't mind, do you? Please. I promise to bring granddad back here. Please. When she speaks, everything is clear. Please take dad around for some time. I am not home yet. General! He is still there. Who is the great general saluting... ...day and night? Right, grandpa. That statue's pose is wrong. What is wrong with that? Why should he salute? Those who pass by could be corruptors. Smart girl. That is the importance of school. Why are you talking about school again? Ijah, please order beef gravel curry, grilled beef jerky, beef kalio. Medan soup too, if you can get it. Don't forget jengkol peas. What else? Vegetable fritters, cassave crisps, cattle skin crisps, cassava leaves stir fry. Yes, those. Please repeat them. Beef gravel curry, grilled beef jerky, beef kalio, medan soup, jengkol peas. Alright, enough. If conditions are stable, I predict we will earn 30 percent more profit... ...compared to the same quarter last year. But if our raw materials supply is going smoothly... - Come to my house tonight. My dad is visiting. - Stop, stop. You two, please leave now. From now on, please be more careful. Watch out for your wallet. You. Hi. The aroma of frangipani by the bed. A king waiting at the door. Bonaga, move over now. There is a woman waiting for me longingly. How are you, Monita? I'm fine, dad. No wonder, Bonaga doesn't want to go back to the village. It turns out there is an angel in this house, right? Dad, she has a husband. Don't flirt with her. He is still jealous of me. Come on, grandpa. When you were little, you fell from this table. What's the matter? I'm annoyed. Why? Because of her granddad... ...Monaga didn't give me a kiss. It's okay... ...kiss me then. One more, one more. Shoot! Goal! Your child is very good at soccer. Yes, she inherited it from her granddad. If she were a boy... ...maybe Ronaldo and Messi... ...will retire right away. Right! To the right... Left, up. Over here! Pass another one. Goal! You are too good. Wait a moment. What are you doing? It's for safety. Oh my... As if it matters. Securing my wallet. Come on in. Not using the spoon? The spoon was washed by Ijah the maid. I washed this hand... ...so I can be sure of it's cleanliness. Right, grandpa? Jengkol peas. It's tasty. Please try it. Have some more. Jengkol peas is the tastiest food... ...in the whole Indonesia. You suck. I have gout, uncle. Every day people eat jengkol peas in Sumatra... ...but I have never heard that there is a gout epidemic there. Try it, go on. Go on. Aunty, uncle. Pity me. I haven't eaten. Who is that? Looks like a beggar, dad. I just lost my appetite. Actually... It is not our duty... ...to take care of them, sir. So who's duty it is? It is the duty of the State... ...as stated in the Constitution. Poor people and homeless children... ...are taken care of by the State. Right? Taken care? That is wrong. Why is it wrong? What is wrong with it, uncle? That is the Constitution, it cannot be wrong. Smart people made it. And it was passed by the Republic of Indonesia's General Assembly. Yes, but why... ...those poor people and homeless children... ...must be taken care of? There will be more of them. They will proliferate. They should be defended. Make them prosperous. - Is that right? - Yes, uncle. Right. That's why they are my staff. Thank you, mbak (sister). Don't call me, "mbak". Just call me "Monaga". What's your name? Nira. Where do you stay? Near the traffic light at the end of the street. Your address? At the... Besides the rice warehouse. Monaga. One moment, mom. Thank you. I have observed... ...that we can't eradicate poverty. Right, if it is eradicated... ...then where will the alms go to? The solution is simple. We have to get used... ...to living together with the poverty. Living together with the poverty? Your watch is very expensive though. Where is my watch, bro? You are just chirping... ...like a bird. Birds, go on, eat! Come on! Rice Warehouse Rice Warehouse Nira! Brother! Brother! May I have some? Don't just eat the doughnut. Get to know her, she gave us the doughnuts. Monaga. A rich kid. I'm Adul. I will be a rich man. Her teachers are so stingy with the grades. She couldn't answer the exams. Here. Take a look at Monaga's answers. This is nice. Nice. Good. Drawing exam, right? No. It is Math exam. Math is difficult. It may be correct... ...but maybe the teacher is not used to it. In the end, the teacher will understand. So, what is her homeroom teacher’s recommendation? Move to another school. Was she expelled again? Yes. She has been expelled twice this semester. My daughter is a genius... ...it is difficult to find the right school for her. Do you want sambal? You two are very romantic. Where are you going? To the kitchen, I work there. No, don't. A wife's main duty... ...is to take care of her husband. Isn't that right? Carry on. Kirana. I miss you so much. I have a Master’s degree from Germany. You graduated Summa Cum Laude from a reputable uiversity. Maybe Monaga's teacher... ...is not good at teaching. Take it easy, Bon. I am taking it easy. Please talk. I'm not thirsty. Please don't be angry. What's the matter? I see that there is a genetic problem here. What do you mean? Her grandpa. What's the matter with my dad? Her grandpa didn't go to school. He said that his mother asked him to go to school... ...but he ran away. His mother told him to pray but he pickpocketted instead. But her grandpa became a general. Are you saying that our child should not go to school like her grandpa? - I didn't say that. - But that's what you meant, right? My father is... There he is. Just ask him directly. In the backyard, I saw a husband and wife... ...spoon-feeding each other. Over here, I see... ...a husband and wife pointing fingers at each other. What will the world say? You should learn from them. I agree with Monita. Your child has problems. You know... ...her grandpa is a general. I am the majority shareholder in this company. My wife's education is higher than all of you. So it could be that the problem lies with the teacher, not with my child. Let me put it this way, Bon. Who you hang out with can change you. Yesterday, I saw that your child... ...hangs out with the wrong people. Isn't that right, Ron? Yes, your child is too close with those in poverty. Poverty is the nation's problem. To this day, not even the President has been able to solve it. Stop it guys. Only Bonaga can understand his child better than all of us. Right, Bon? Where does your child go to school, Pom? My child goes to the same school like your child. Because she was expelled, you asked my child to move as well. So that my child can accompany your child. But please, Bon. No more moving. I'm tired of taking care of it. - How about yours? - In Manado, with his grandma. - And yours, Zack? - Thank God, he's okay. He is in Egypt. Do you want me to enroll your child there? No, don't. I only have one child... ...you have six children. From two wives, Bon. That's my man! I dare you, circus tiger. He is not a tiger, he is a cat. A cat? Meow! Meow! Your coffee, dad. Thank you. I'm sorry if I troubled you. I'm the one who troubled you. You had to come to Jakarta because of Monaga. Where will Monaga go to school? That's it, dad. She has changed school three times just in this semester. She is good... ...she will have a lot of friends. She will not have a hard life. But it is difficult to find another school. An angel should not be sad. I will help you find a school for Monaga. Where is that girl? I want to go to school. Why? Because my dad didn't go to school, he is poor. Are you sure that if you go to school, you will be rich? People can't fool you, that's for sure. Says who? Dad! Don't hang around with rich people's children. You will be too lazy to earn money. This school is one of the best schools in Jakarta, sir. Right. My grandchild should study here. I don't think so, sir. Why? There is a specific note here. She often gets into fights. So what? That note is only part of it, grandpa. I defended myself, that is why I was in a fight. Do you hear her? I used to fight... ...defending this nation. If I didn't hit the Dutch people... ...they would not have left this country. So if my grandchild fought... ...to defend herself, what's wrong with that? So is my grandchild accepted? No, sir. I'm sorry. A school is the place to educate our children to be smart. If you are smart, you don't need to go to school then? You have to go to school... ...to be smarter. So when can my grandchild join this school? I'm sorry sir. We cannot accept your grandchild. Because there is a standard on grades, age, and zone rules... ...that we have to follow before we can accept a student. Those are the rules. Who made the rules? The Education Minister, sir. Who elected the Education Minister? - It is the President, sir. - Who elected the President? It is the people. And the people are almost always right. Maybe this time the people are wrong. She is right as well. Your father wants a grandson. How do you know? "If she were a boy, maybe Ronaldo and Messi will retire." And? Bon. Let's have another child. Maybe we will get a son. What if it's a girl again? My life will be like Rusli. - Rusli? - Rusli has five children. All of them girls. They are from two wives. - What do you mean? - He is looking for a third wife. Hopefully a white woman. - Are you going to remarry? - No, I am just telling you about Rusli. He is my childhood friend back in the village. Why should you talk about Rusli? Because he has two wives, five kids. All girls. Is he your only childhood friend? No, Mon. You are talking about him because you want to remarry, don't you? Come on, let's talk about having another child. - I have a meeting. - Just cancel it. - Bon, no... - Come on. It won't take long. Just adopt a child... ...you can choose whether you want a male or female child. That depends, Zack. You adopt a son, he could grow to be a girl. - How could that be? - A queer. Oh, my... You better get an IVF treatment... ...you can customize your baby. Male triplets. You are out of your mind. What's the matter, Bon? Why does Monita want to have a son so badly? Monita wants to make my father happy. Because... ...a son... ...is the pride of the Batak people. That is why we have never heard of ... ...a female national hero from Batak, right? Right. From Aceh, you have Cut Nyak Dien. From West Sumatra, there is H.R. Rasuna Said. From West Java, there is Dewi Sartika. From Central Java, R.A. Kartini. And from Batak? Who? Maybe we just don't know it. Maybe it's not that popular. Ask my father, maybe he knows. - Who? - My grandmother. What did your grandmother do? She raised my dad alone... ...until he became a general. He fought the Dutch colonials... ...until Indonesia became independent. That is why you people can get rich... ...because you work for me. I am her grandson. Right... In this era of independence, I still have to fight... ...to find a school for my grandchild. What will the world say? Sir. Ma'am. Please give me some money so I can eat. Nira! Nira! Yudika Foundation For Sale Is this really the place? Yes, grandpa. I used to study here. Are you sure you want to study here? I am sure, grandpa. How can I help you, sir? Who are you? I am Wahid. The headmaster of this school. I am good at fixing tyres. A headmaster needs to eat too, sir. This used to be... ...the 11th grade classroom. How come it is used to store rice now? Because there were no students... ...the foundation rented it out to the rice traders. Why is he there? That is appropriate, grandpa. - Why? - According to Google... ...in Soeharto's era, Indonesia was rice independent. That is right. Please move the pictures of that general and the other national heroes... ...to a more fitting place. This used to be the 12th grade classroom. Why are goats the students now? They're better than human... ...who will become corruptors after graduation. Long live the goats! This used to be the cafeteria. But I never ate here. - Let's take a look at my old classroom. - Come on. What do you use the other classrooms for? The foundation has plans... ...to make them the party's headquarter. That teachers' room... ...is going to be rented out for online gambling. Oh my God. Are you the school's caretaker or the school's broker? What will the world say? That school is closed, dad. It will be reopened if there are 30 students... ...in order to pay for the teachers salaries. That's what Wahid said. He is the school's headmaster. He is also the tyre repairman. Where will the other students come from? I will take care of it, dad. Monaga, honey. You have to go to the best school. That school will be the best school when I study there, mom. That school is closed, dear. But we have grandpa. He even takes care of the dead people. A school is nothing for him. I'm on it. If it is a command... ...I will carry it out right away. Damn it. I'm worried about my father in law, my husband, my child. They're the same. They are all stubborn. Don't worry too much, Mon. That school is closed, right? Just buy it out. Don't be like the poor. Demolish it and build an apartment. Get lots of profits. Money, money, money. You only think of money. You make me more dizzy. If we have money, we will not be worried, right? This is Mr. Fisko, he is the geography teacher. This is Ms. Matilda, the economics teacher. That is Mr. Umar, history and Indonesian language teacher. Is your name Umar? - Yes, sir. - Who is your father? Bakri. Turns out... ...you are that Umar Bakri. No, he is Umar. I know that. Umar Bakri, the honest and devoted teacher. That is why you ride a bicycle. Pray for me, sir. So I can be firm on my beliefs. If we buy it, we can turn it into an international school. You have a lot of money, don't be like the poor. - But on one condition. - What is it? Make me the headmaster. You still cheat on your taxes... ...and you want to be the headmaster? What will your students be? Thieves? Don't be mistaken... ...thieves need education and certificates too, right? You're right. How come there are only five students, sir? It won't be enough to pay the teachers salaries. There are only five students, but I will pay for thirty students. So the teachers can focus, sir. If we are not getting smarter it means the teachers are not smart. Or you are dumb. If the teachers get a salary, do we get salary too, sir? Enough, enough. You kids get the knowledge. The teachers... ...get a salary and rewards. If God is willing. Your father was a soldier. He must be a nationalistic person. As long as it is in the interest of the nation, ...I am sure your father will concede. - And? - We have to build... ...a monumental infrastructure... ...in the interest of the people. And what is that? Let's buy that school... ...and build the biggest toilet complex... ...in all of Southeast Asia. 24 floors. It will be in the Guinness Book of Records. Free wifi in the toilet. Don't forget to equip it with karaoke facilities. So that the woman who are bathing, washing or going to the toilet... ...feel happy and comfortable. If they are spending the night there... ...the divorce numbers will go up. - You are going to have another one? - Take that as a note. Keep on chirping you birds. For Sale The commander is entering the venue. Attention. Ten-hut! Can't you add more participants here? There are only these people, sir. Aren't there any other living things around here? Yes, there are. Get them here... ...to salute the flag. On it, sir. I told him that yesterday. Do you want to have a motorcycle? I do. The future of this nation... ...is in the hands of Indonesia's younger generation. At present, your responsibility is to study. Knowledge can make you the heroes of this nation. Maintain unity. Respect the differences. Uphold justice at all costs. Never give up. And don't forget... ...to pray. So, as... Goats, keep quiet! Thank you. Ten-hut! Salute to the commander. Maintain unity. Respect the differences. Uphold justice at all costs. Never give up. And don't forget to pray. So... Goats, keep quiet! Thank you. Nationalistic goats. Do you like it that our child is studying in a goat pen? Many prophets were shepherds too, Mon. I am talking about our child's school. Not goats! - Don't cry. - I want to cry. - Why are you crying? - Because I am sad. As a mother, I failed to educate my own child. And I am sad because you, her father... ...is not sad that your child is studying in a goat pen. It is a school, not a goat pen. - It is a goat pen! - A school with a goat pen. A goat pen turned into a school. Alright... Let's ask her grandpa. Is it a school or a goat pen? Monaga is our child. You and I are her parents. Her grandpa should be in Medan... ...taking care of the palm plantation. Not taking care of our child. Don't you like it that my dad is here? Bon. I love and respect your dad. I am ashamed... ...that your dad is still taking care of our child. Then... Should I be ashamed... ...or cry? Mon. Mon. Monita. Don't cry. The freedom of this nation... ...was not gained freely. It was paid for with blood and tears. Don't waste the sacrifices of the heroes. What do you want? I want to get Nira, my daughter and her friends... ...to work. You go to work, let them study. I didn't go to school, so I can't get a job. If so, just work at this school. What do I teach? You don't teach... ...you help Wahid repair the tyres. Gather grass for the goats. Help clean this school every day. If it’s just helping out... ...will I get some money? I will pay your wage. Do you want it? - Sir! - What now? Your hand. Yes, I agree. I swear, I agree. I agree. In a country which has rich natural resources... ...why are so many people still poor? It's their destiny, ma'am. Many people are egoistic, they only think of themselves. Nira? This country is like Adul, ma'am. It's fat but poor. Monaga? It is caused by moral crisis, ma'am. Why for 350 years... ...the Dutch managed to conquer us? Probably they didn't have anything to do in their own country. No, the Indonesians are nice people... ...who respect their guests. The Dutch just didn't respect us as their host. Before this becomes a hoax... ...let's just ask the Dutch directly. What the... Indonesia ia an archipelago. It has vast seas. How many islands are there in this whole archipelago? More than 17 thousand, sir. But according to the UN data... ...there are 13,466 islands. Right. You are smart. Grandpa. Naga. Dad, Naga. I am a Naga too. We have decided... ...that Monaga should study abroad. If she studies abroad, who will teach her... ...to salute the Indonesian flag? Who will teach her the Pancasila? Who will teach her to pray? I studied abroad... ...yet I am still loyal to Indonesia. You went abroad for your further studies. It's different from Monaga. She is still in high school. Is it because Monaga is a girl... ...that you have to go through all of this trouble, dad? What do you mean? Maybe... ...you want... ...a grandchild who is... Go on. Continue it, Bon. What is going on here? We are Batak people. So what? Are you bored of being Batak? No. - Go on. - Well... We want to make you happy as Batak people, dad. Do you think I have a hard life as a Batak? What will the world say? Just a little more, Bon. Monita wants to stop using her birth control. That is the doctor's business, not mine. Focus, Bon... Monita... ...wants to have a son to make you happy. As long as I don't marry a white woman... ...like what Rusli wants for himself. - Is that right, Mon? - No. As far as I know... ...for the Batak people having a son... Stop it. I understand. Listen to me carefully. When I was born, I survived and lived on. My father died. As for Bonaga... ...when he was born, he survived and lived. But his mother died. And then there were both of us men, Bonaga. And then Monaga was born... ...she survived and lived. Both of you are also still alive now. That's what is important for me. Not the other things. Do you understand? Everything is fixed now. Not yet. There is one more thing, about studying in a goat pen... A goat cannot teach Monaga how to recite the Holy Book. When my mom told me to go to school, I ran away. When my mom told me to recite the Holy Book, I became a pickpocket. And I became a general. Monaga my grandchild, she wants to go to school. She can recite the Holy Book... ...and is always grateful. So what are you afraid of? You both should pray. Dad! She could become the President. Your mom is sad. I am sad too for making mom sad. Are you sad too, Bonaga? Yes. If I am happy, what will the world say? Maybe your mom is right. I feel that I am right too. Do you feel right too, Bonaga? Yes. If my grandchild, my son,and my daughter in law... ...are feeling they are right, maybe it's my presence here that is not right. You are not wrong. This is my mistake. I am your dad, this is my mistake. And you are my son, Bonaga. So this is my mistake. I am the wrong one. I am the one who asked you to come to Jakarta. Enough... Let's decide... ...that it is the mistake of Jakarta. Enough! I just want to see. Hello? Grandpa, you have to teach at the school. Why? This week we have only studied Indonesian language with Mr. Umar. Where are the other teachers? They are doing sidejobs to pay for their motorcycle. My cellphone is low on battery, please come quick, alright? Hello, Monaga? I will pay forty. Each of you will pay twenty. If necessary, we buy that school this week. And who will be the headmaster? Not you, for sure. Not me either, Bon. Not me. I'm busy taking care of my wife and kids. Why not your father, Bon? My father can’t even read and write properly. How did he become a general? Just ask him how. No, I won't. Where are we going, grandpa? We are going to study. I am your teacher now. - It's empty, Bon. - There are only sacks of rice. And goats. Where are the kids? I asked that question too. What did he say? "If anybody asks, just say that I am taking them." That's what Mr. Naga said. - Yes, but where? - Exactly. I asked that question too. The number you are calling is not active or out of service. I don't want to hear any bad news about Monaga. Go find her! Relax Mon, Monaga knows her way home. Relax how? Make sure Monaga is already home when I get home. This sucks. Only three portions of rice? I'm sorry, only this is left. We are closing. Please enjoy. Let's go to another place. How could you? I'm starving. Enough, don't be noisy. Done. Let's eat now. This is not fair. Why does Adul get more? Now this is not fair. Fair doesn't always mean everybody gets the same amount. This is about humanity. I agree. Now this is fair. Not just fair but civilized too. A fair and civilized humanity. Yes. Let's eat. In the name of God. A windfall! Let's divide it. It is illegal. Who agrees to divide it? Good. What are you going to do with it? Let's just give it to the Police. - No, don't. - Why? Does the Police own that wallet? No. We have to return it to the owner. We will get hungry again. If you want to be an honest person... ...you must be able to resist hunger. Let's return the wallet to its owner. Let's go, Dul. How could you make your parents worry? Just ask grandpa. Why didn't you just inform us? My cellphone was low on battery, mom. You didn't try hard enough. - Don't you think I am important? - You are important, mom. I am still allowed to think about you, aren't I? Yes, you are, mom. Bon, don't just keep quiet. Say something to your child. What's the matter, dad? Monaga... ...is just like your mother. So when you are angry at her, that means you are angry at your mother. I can get angry at you. Do you understand? In this matter, I am the one who was wrong. So you all can just get angry at me. I was wrong, not you grandpa. Grandpa is, not you. - I am. - Grandpa. Enough, enough. It is my mistake. Yes, it is your mistake. Yes, I agree. It is your mistake because you let her study in that goat pen. And because she studies in that goat pen, she thinks her friends are more important than us, her parents. Mom and dad are important for me. Do I still have a say in determining your future? Yes, you do, mom. Monaga... ...my beloved child. I could die if something happens to you. Mon, please don't cry. I am still allowed to cry, right? Yes, you are. You are. Forgive Monaga, mom. What's the matter, dad? I just want to cry. Give me a hug. If two men are crying, what will the world say? Whatever! You will study at home. Home schooling. Grandpa. - Dad? - You are her father, speak up. Yes, but... ...I still have a father. You speak up. You should speak up, Monaga. Abraham Lincoln didn't go to school. He became a US president. Thomas Alva Edison didn't go to school. He discovered electricity. Mark Zuckerberg only needed five minutes to decide to quit college. If he continued his study, maybe there will be no Facebook today. They could become great people... ...because they never stop learning. Like grandpa... ...he didn't go to school, right? But he could become a general. It was because of my mother. Monaga's mom is great too. I know... ...mom and dad can send me to study wherever you like. So why do you have to go to study in a goat pen? Because they can't study there if I don't go to that school, mom. You are not the same like them, dear. But they have the same rights like me, mom. To go to school. She is good. My child. That is my grandchild. Monaga. You are my child. The child of Monita, a graduate from the best school. The child of Bonaga, a successful businessman. And you are the grandchild of a general. That's why you don't have to worry. Your blood that is clever, runs in my body. Dad's blood that is successful. And grandpa's blood that is brave. The blood of the people who love this nation. So what do you want? Let me study with them. Maybe I will not be the best. But give me the chance... ...to do good things. Being useful to others. Eating so happily, eh? Who gave you the permission to eat here? You have no manners… No! - Throw them out. - Okay. Don't. Let them be. Don't throw them out. Go away, stop eating. Put on your shoes, take your bag. Don't! Your shoes. Take your plate. Look at Indonesia with your Heart. Spiritful Respect. Create a Dignified Nation.
