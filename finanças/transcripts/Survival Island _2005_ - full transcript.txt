[Gasps] [gasps] [gasps] [coughing] [up-tempo caribbean music playing] i knew they were expecting us, but this is ridiculous. It's a... band. It's like mardi gras. Girl: lucky charm. Thank you. Look. What do you think? You're a very shrewd businesswoman. Is that the boat? That's it. The old massachusetts does real well in these waters. Gail: well done, jack. She's beautiful. Gail: well done, jack. She's beautiful. Mr. Madson. Call me jack. Gary richards. I'm your captain. This is jennifer. Hi, jennifer. This is gail. Hi, gail. That's bill. Bashful, sleepy, grumpy. Who is that? This is manny and pepe. They're helping me on the boat. Manny knows the fishing in these waters really well. He can hook up with me anytime. Gail. Be careful with the little one. It's got a laptop in it. Sí, señor. I know what you're thinking. Naughty, naughty. Manuel, tenemos que hablar. No te puedes ir hoy. No me puedes hacer esto, manuel. Manuel, te estoy hablando, icarajo! No es el momento, maria. Sí, que es el momento. God, what's going on? Me voy de acá hasta que no hablemos. ¿Quieres que hablemos? Sí. No te quiero ver nunca más en mi puta vida, ¿entiendes? Ooh, that's gonna leave a mark. Ooh, that's gonna leave a mark. Hijo de puta. Ihijo de puta! Aah! Son of a bitch. Jack -- jack, don't get involved. Gary: no, she's right, best to stay out of it. Ten cuidado. Y ustedes también. God, that was weird. Bill: come on, everybody. Let's eat. Bill: come on, everybody. Let's eat. Gail: barry is marrying ann wells. Jack: they're both gay. You just thought they were gay. They're gay as spring. [Banging] good knock. Say, manny? We're gonna need another bottle here. We're going deep tonight. Come on, top me off. To the four of us, and the hell with everyone else. Together: the four of us, and to hell with everyone else. Jack: boom boom. Grab a glass, manny. No, thank you. Tough day on the docks, huh? Tough day on the docks, huh? Excuse me? The señorita busting your balls. Have a shot. Have a drink with us. Have a sniff -- snooter -- snifter. Clearly it does wonders for me. Is there any else you need? No, we're fine, thanks. You shouldn't have said anything, jack. The guy's an asshole. [Mid-tempo percussion music plays] [indistinct chanting] i got to get in shape again before you weigh me on the dock like a marlin. Then stuff you. No, too late for that. My head is killing me. Why don't you just have another beer in the morning, why don't you just have another beer in the morning, like the good old days. Now you're talking. Come here, homer. D'oh. You want an aspirin? Nope. [Laughter] oh, my god. Show me your sea legs. Merry christmas. You gonna take those off? Are you gonna use your teeth? [Moaning] [light laughter] [light laughter] tighter. [Metal clanking] one of these days i'm gonna let someone come in here. What will he do? Who says it's a he? What would she do? How about this? Aah! Come on. He's been on that phone all morning. He's driving me crazy. Well, at least we've got someone's attention. Shall i flash him? No. Okay, then we understand each other. So, just buy it, all right? Just hold on a second. Manuel -- have you seen him? He's making us some margaritas. I've been waiting for beers for 20 minutes downstairs. I don't know what's taking so long. Is there a problem, mr. Madson? Is there a problem, mr. Madson? Yes, the problem is we can't get any beer downstairs. Got it right here, señor. I'll call you back. And señoras. Thank you. Fría como un yanqui. Thank you very much. That guy's got a lot of attitude. I'll take care of it. You just stay on course. You're messing with him. I can see it. You're messing with him. I can see it. He's the one who's messing with me. He's a customer. He spent a lot of money for this. Well, he has no respect for anyone. Look, if you can't handle it, you're out of here, okay? Fine! I'm out of here! Okay, i'll put you off at the next port. What's going on? Just bring some ice and beer up on deck, please. What's the problem, manuel? Este señor es un pendejo. That's what the problem is. Este señor es un pendejo. That's what the problem is. Why don't you just give him what he wants? You give him what he wants. You got one! Come on! [Laughs] whoo-hoo! Reel him in, buddy. Just let him run. You don't have to do it all at once. I hope it doesn't come up here. Why, are we out of margaritas? What are they gonna do with it when they get it? Beat it to death. Let it run. Ah. Ah. Oh, my god, it's smoke. Captain richards! We've got a problem up here! Shit. Shit. Maggie: what is it? The whole place is on fire. Look at the size of this thing! What are we going to do? Stay here. Did you learn anything about this? We're gonna abandon the ship. We're gonna abandon the ship. You did not just say, "abandon ship"! Just get in the lifeboat! Do what i tell you! Get down. Go, let's go. [Indistinct talking] [screaming] gary: i can't reach anyone on the damn radio! It didn't go through! All right, next time we're skiing. I'll see you on the beach! Captain! [Crying] captain! Ohh! Ohh! Captain richards! Captain richards! Aah! Aah! I just -- i just found him. I just found him in the water. Oh, my god. Fuck, he's gone. Did you see anyone else? Have you seen jack? No. No. [Thunder crashes] i can't believe this is happening. It's so cold. So cold. It's okay. You're going to be okay. You're going to be okay. Good morning. Thanks for keeping me warm last night. You kept me warm as well. So, how long do yothink it'll be before they come looking for us? They don't even know we're missing yet. Yeah, but when they do. Could be weeks, maybe months. This is not miami beach. You sound like you don't even care what happens. I'm just happy to be alive. Want one of these? Is there gonna be anything else? You mean for lunch or dinner? No, i -- i just mean anything. Maybe a fish, if i get lucky. Are you sure we can't light a fire? With what? I don't know. Your goggles, the rock, the knife. They do it all the time in the movies. The goggles have no magnification, and there is no flint in this place. Well, how do you know that? Because i live in a place like this. Do you really think i don't want to have a fire? No. No. No. No. I'm sorry. We need to make a house. A house? Aah. How are you doing? I'm sore all over. Did you see anything? Nothing. Let's take a swim before it gets dark. Make you feel better. What about my blisters? What about my blisters? It'll be good for them. Come on. Leave your clothes on the beach. You don't want to be sleeping in wet things. Oh, my... come on. There's nobody here. You're here. I don't know what difference it makes. We already slept together. Come on. I'll look the other way. Don't look. This is so nice. This is so nice. See? You have to learn to trust me. Can i ask you something personal? Go ahead. Why did you hit that girl on the dock the other day? You don't seem that kind of person. She made me that way. She made you hit her? Sure. She hit me. She kicked me. She made me look bad in front of my friends. Why do you think she did that? I have no idea. Because she doesn't want to face her problems. She wants to blame me for everything, she wants to blame me for everything, and she wants to punish me for that. Well, what are her problems? [Sighs] she's pregnant, or so she says. She wants to marry me. But i say no. You mean she's not a virgin? Were you a virgin when you got married? That's not the point. Just answer the question. It's none of your business. It's none of your business. Oh, i see. So, you want to know everything about my life, but you say nothing about yours. You have a double standard. What on earth are you talking about? You are just like your husband. You have money, so you think you're better than everyone else. That is absolutely not true. You don't know what i think. You're just being stupid. Stupid? You think i'm stupid? Let me tell you something. The only reason you will survive in this place is because i feed you and i look after you. Is because i feed you and i look after you. I don't need to take anymore of this. Would you look the other way, please? No. Great-looking ass, señora -- shaped like a perfect heart. Maybe that's why god didn't give you a real one. You sleeping? My mother used to do this to my father when i was a child. She'd punish him by not talking, and you know what he'd whisper to me? He'd say, "pretend you're sad and enjoy the silence." He'd say, "pretend you're sad and enjoy the silence." If you get cold, you can come next to me. Going fishing? Out to the reef. Isn't that dangerous? Best place to get lobster. So, what do you think? About what? Anything. Anything. I don't want to fight with you anymore, manuel. I don't want to fight with you, either, señora. My name's jenny. You don't have to call me señora. Okay, jenny. So, can we be friends? We are friends. We sleep together, remember? [Lobster squeals] you know where you are? [Gasps] you know who i am? Jenny! Damn it. Jack? Jack! Jack! Oh! Oh! Where you been? Where did you find him? He was on the reef. Are you okay? What have you done? Are you okay? What have you done? Easy. Okay. We're getting there. Hey, baby. Oh. I love you. What took you so long? Just put him down here. Jack, come down here, baby. Ow! Just take it easy, okay? Oh. Aah! Ohh! Aah! Ohh! What's wrong, babe? My back. [Groans] he needs water. Give him some. Yes. Let's go over this way. Here, baby. Have a glass of water. Mmm. Oh. Okay? I thought i lost you. I thought i'd lost you. [Crying] it's all right. I won't leave you, babe. [Crying] it's all right. I won't leave you, babe. Oh, god. Don't do that to me, baby. Thank you. Thank you. Some water. Yeah, some more water. I'll do it. I'll do it. Let me do it, babe. Mmm. I missed you. I need to lie down. Yes. Just give me a minute. He's sleeping. He doesn't seem to remember anything. Just needs to rest. Hungry? Yeah. Thanks for saving him. I nearly didn't. I'm just joking. [Laughing] got it? There! There! There! There! Oh! Oh! Where? There! There! [Laughter] it's there! Oh! There! There! There! Anybody ready for some hot breakfast? How did you do that? Do what? Light the fire. Oh, that. I rubbed a couple sticks together, you know, boy-scout style. That's incredible. We couldn't light anything. Yeah, well, i couldn't catch a lobster. Where did you find them? You have to go to the reef, and you have to have goggles. Which two sticks did you use? Which two sticks did you use? Well, it's not indigenous flora. You cheat! I knew it. You're such a brat. "Such a brat." It's good to see you feeling well. It's good to be feeling, period. Mmm. Bill and gail? I'm not ready to deal with that right now. I'm not ready to deal with that right now. But you two have been very busy. I have to say, i'm, you know -- what? You built a hut. You got a reservoir. Manuel did it. I just helped. Oh. You did great, really. I'm in the construction business, and i'm impressed. This smells good, baby. Yeah, it does. Give me that. What do you need? I want to cut it open. Let me get it. He doesn't trust me with the knife. I like to keep it sharp. I like to keep it sharp. How dull. Here. Here. You want some? Go ahead. I'm gonna take a swim first. Jenny: he's been so good. Really? Mm-hmm. Well, it looks like he's been having a hell of a good time. What are you talking about? Come on, you guys are shacked up here like the fucking blue lagoon. Like the fucking blue lagoon. I don't really see separate quarters. Don't do this, jack. We've been here two days trying to survive. Hmm. We didn't have time to build a goddamn hilton. Yeah, well, you built a honeymoon suite, didn't you? You had plenty of time for that. Where are you going? To take a swim. Oh, great. All the kids are doing it. Sorry. Mmm. I'm sorry. Oh, look, i'm -- i'm tired. I'm sad. I'm angry, crusty. "Me, me, me, me, me," and i'm sorry, all right? And i'm sorry, all right? We all have to get along, jack. It's the only way we're gonna make it. You're right. Slow. Just stop enjoying it so much, would you? Does he know where we are? No. Seen any planes? Nope. Boat? Freighters, shipping lanes, nothing like that? No, nothing. No, nothing. Did you fuck him? Yeah. Good. He's great. He's cute. Thank you. What are you doing? The ones with liquid, they taste like monkey's ass, and the other ones don't have any liquid in them. You have to get the mature ones if you want them to be juicy. Why goggles? Goggles? Goggles? I don't know. He had them when he got here. Don't you find that just, like, a little bit strange? I mean, the boat's on fire. He has the foresight to grab goggles? Well, maybe they were in his pocket. Maybe he was just glad to see you. Oh, cute. You're being ridiculous. Am i? Hey! How did it go? The water's too cloudy. What about t reef? What about t reef? Too rough today. I won't be able to keep what i catch. Why don't you take her with you? I don't want to go. That okay? Bring back a lobster, it'll be better than okay. It's a long way away. Are you sure you can swim that far? She's a great swimmer! I'm not a good swimmer. Shush. Okay. Come on, let's go. Okay, let's go. Great. You light the fire, yeah? Princess. Princess. You know what busts my balls more than anything here is that i can't grieve for my friends because zorro here is packing a blade and he wants to bed my wife. So, if you can do me a favor and pretend that you don't notice for a little bit longer and occupy him out there on the reef for me, maybe i can weep for them if that's possible. Oh, quit the crap, jack. I've been here two days longer than you. Quit busting my balls. Quit busting my balls. Okay, i'm going down. Okay, i'm going down. You stay here. But stay away from the coral. It'll cut you if you touch it, okay? [Gasps] you got one. That's great. How far did you go down? 40 feet. You want to see? Okay. There's a shark. He's coming this way. It's okay. He won't hurt you. You knew it was there, didn't you, you brat? Ow! Oh. Something just bit me. Ah, let me see. Let me see. Ouch. It's a jellyfish. It hurts. You have to pee on it to get rid of the pain. I can't pee on the back of my arm. I can't pee on the back of my arm. Yeah, well, that's what friends are for. No me puedo creer. He dug up the captain. Oh, no. What did you do, jack? He wasn't needing them. I don't know how you could do that. I don't know how you could do that. It was easy. My feet are bleeding and my head is sunburned. You smoke cigars, manuel? There's plenty left. No. Why did you move the hut? Why do you think? Take the dinghy or the hut. I don't care which. It wasn't yours to move, jack. You think we should all live in some little fucking hut? It's okay. I'll take the dinghy. Good choice. You don't have to do that. Yes, he does. He built it. You built it! We can take the dinghy. No. No. What's the matter with you? Me? You shouldn't have moved the hut without discussing it. You like this boy. And you shouldn't have dug up the captain. That's disgusting. You like him, don't you? You are determined to make this as complicated... you do. But you do. ...as you can, aren't you, jack? Don't you? He saved my life. Yeah. He saved yours as well, for that matter. Yeah, but this is different. Come on. Come on. The least you could do is show him some respect. I don't understand why you're not telling me what happened here. Nothing happened. It's in your head. You're making it up. Am i? Yeah, it's in your head. What is that? I got stung -- jellyfish. Serves you right -- bad karma. Serves you right -- bad karma. It hurts. How you doing? How you doing? I'm fine. How are you? Okay. You sure? You don't look okay. He can't hear us from there. It doesn't matter. He's being silly. He thinks we're having an affair or something. Maybe we should. No use getting the blame without the fun, right? Don't even joke about that. Don't even joke about that. I'm not joking. Jack! Food's ready. Is that for me? Yeah, let me get it. No need. Courtesy of the captain. See, now we're both armed and dangerous, aren't we? Manuel was telling me that he studied civil engineering at miami state for two years. At miami state for two years. Wow, build a hell of a beach hut with a degree like that, can't you? You know, jack, i don't need to take your bullshit anymore. Well, what are you gonna do about it? Why are you doing this? You really want to fight me? You know what i want? I want you to stay the fuck away from my wife! Iputa! Or i'm gonna kick your ass all over this goddamn beach! He's never touched me! Save it! He's never touched me! Save it! No, that doesn't mean i didn't think about it. You are a cocky little beach boy, aren't you? That's right. And in this place your money means nothing. You're just a fucking stupid gringo that can't even feed himself. At least i can cook it, so why don't you stay the fuck away from my fire? You want to play the big gringo? Just stop this now, okay? You keep your fire, but you feed yourself from now on, and i will do nothing to help you. We don't need your help. We don't need your help. And when we get out of here, i'm gonna make your life hell. I'm gonna ruin you when we get back. Well, you better start praying they find you soon, 'cause i am going to ruin your whole life here. Pelotudo es mierda. ¿Quién te pensas qué sos? Oh, great. Great! That was so stupid. Jack, what are we gonna do now? You can't even get us a coconut. You think he's gonna feed us now? I will f-- i'll feed us! I'll feed us! I'll feed us! Coming? Got one. Got one. I'm not gonna eat that. I am. [Retching] ugh. Okay. We're not gonna eat here again. I got one. Great. That's great. Nice. I'm going to the reef. Here. You can't see without goggles. You can't see without goggles. Give me the knife. Whatever. See you in a bit. [Jenny coughing] so, you mad at me, too? No. Do you want some food? I can't. What are you talking about? I'd feel like i was letting him down. Who cares what he thinks? He's an idiot. He's my husband. He treats you like shit. He doesn't usually act like this. He doesn't usually act like this. Fine, be a good wife. What do i care? He doesn't have to know what you do anyway. I won't say anything. I don't trust you. You don't trust me? Even if i swear to god on the very life of my mother? Yeah, maybe then i will trust you, manuel. Then i swear to the whole world that i would never tell him. That i would never tell him. I wouldn't even tell him if you gave me a little kiss, either. What did you have to say that for? Because i wanted to kiss you from the very first time i saw you. That's not fair, manuel. Why is saying what i think not fair? It's never just a kiss. Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay. You don't have to do anything you don't want. Just take some food. You promise you won't say anything? I wouldn't do anything to hurt you. Okay. I only want a little. Yeah, sure. Here. [Laughs] you want some more juice? Mmm, thank you. Mmm. I'm sorry all this has happened. Hey, it's not your fault. Qué hermosa estás. What? You look very beautiful. No, i don't. Imagine how it would be if it was just jack and me. You'd probably ask him for a kiss, too. That's really good you still can smile. I can see you've done this before. Done what? You know what. No. I better go. Can i take some more? For jack? No, i can't tell him. It's for me. Sure, have some more. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, maybe next time i can make you a whole feast so i can get a decent kiss. [Chuckles] i was beginning to worry about you. I told you not to light a fire. It's okay. He's not here. He's across the island. So you spoke to him? Yes, jack, i spoke to him. What did he say? He just asked if i was okay, and i said i was. He just asked if i was okay, and i said i was. That's it? Yeah. So, did you get anything? Yeah. Get me a cigarette, would you, baby? Here's a couple more. What are they? I don't know. They're fish. What's this? What? What's that? What's that? It looks like fish. Must be from the other day. The other day? What are you saying, jack? You think i'm catching fish and eating them without you? Big day at the reef, jack? Just ignore him. [Laughs] he gave it to you, didn't he? No, he didn't. So, why did you light the fire? I lit the fire so we could cook what you got. I lit the fire so we could cook what you got. You shouldn't eat the yellow ones! They're poisonous! Nobody asked your opinion! Just trying to be a good neighbor! You're lying to me? You're lying to me, and he's feeding you. Okay, you want to know the truth, jack? I stole some fish from him today, and i ate it, and i couldn't save you any because i knew you were gonna start acting like this, because i knew you were gonna start acting like this, you were gonna start this whole thing again. Oh, manuel! Yes, jack? You know that my wife stole fish from you today? She wouldn't have to steal from me. If she wanted it, i give it to her. Thank you. Anytime. Let's just cook what you got. Including the yellow ones? Why don't we just move away, baby? Move down the beach? Move down the beach? Get out of the cross draft? Let the sand flies get us? No, fuck him. Let him move. You're gonna lose that one. Don't step on them. Just be careful, will you? I can't eat those. Here, here. I got it. It's war. Come on, tough guy. Huh? I can't eat that. They look nasty, but they're delicacies in, uh... they look nasty, but they're delicacies in, uh... i'll show you. I'll cut one open. They're good, right? See if we can get some more? Go ahead. I just got to... look, he put out the fire. That son of a bitch. No, jack. Jack. Jack. It's just a fire. Hey! Hey! Jack! Hey, our fire! That's our fire! You stole our fire, you son of a bitch. It's my fire! You don't have a fire! You stole our lighter, then! I don't need your lighter! A little spark flew across the island and landed right here. Right here? Did it? Right there, huh? How about there? How about there? I think it landed right -- jack! Jack, no! Stop it! Jack, what are you -- get off! Jack, stop it! You've gone mad! Jack, stop it! You've gone mad! Jack, it's only a fire! Stop it! Jack! Stop it! You want to finish this, pendejo?! You want to finish it?! Give me the knife! No! Come on! Get out, jenny! He's the one that started it! He's the reason we're here! You're going loco. It doesn't matter whose fire it is. You went below deck when the fire started! He was there! You think i burned down the ship so i can spend my life with you? With me? No. No, no, no, not me. Am i right? Am i right? Oh, look at the two of you. You took our fire? I'm taking your fish. Go ahead and take it! You know how fucking stupid you look? It will only remind you of how good things taste when you have nothing tomorrow! Jack! Pelotudo es mierda. [Fire crackling] [fire crackling] [pounding] jack! Jack! Jack! Don't look at me that way, manuel. You've got to stop doing this. I don't want any more of your food. I can't be your friend. I don't want to be your friend. I don't want to be your friend. Ihijo de puta! He took my goggles! I'll kill him. I'm gonna fucking kill him! He's just hungry, manuel! We're both just hungry! Yeah, well, he's been asking for it. Yeah, well, he's been asking for it. I'm gonna give it to him! Let go! Let go! Let go! I'm gonna kill him for sure! I'll get your goggles. Just put that down. Let go! Let go! No! Aah! No! Don't! No! Let me up. He's gonna know. I don't care if he knows. I don't care if he knows. I can't do this. Come live with me. I can't do that. Why? You've got to promise me you won't say anything. Promise you won't say a word. You can't say anything. Okay. I promise. I promise. But it's not just women who are good at these things. He'll look into your eyes and he will know. So, why did you do it if you knew that? Because i love you. The wind blew them all the way over there. Baby. Huh? Look at that. Oh, that's great. I had another one, right? I had another one, right? But a shark comes up, he takes it off my spear! There's sharks everywhere. I mean, i had the "jaws" thing, like everybody else, but now -- sharks, schmarks! They're fucking everywhere. They're fish. It was awesome. It made me feel like i was -- well, it made me feel horny is what it made me feel. Why don't we get some cold chow down and hit the tree line for just a little eh-oh-eh-oh? What? Nothing. You shouldn't have taken his goggles, jack. You shouldn't have taken his goggles, jack. He went crazy. He wanted to kill you. Good. Now he knows how i felt. We should smoke some of this and save it for later. Look at that bad boy. Huh? Man and fish? Hello? [Laughs] so, what did he say? I told you. He went crazy. He looks pretty calm now. He looks pretty calm now. What did he do? Nothing. What did you do? I told him he was being stupid, just like i told you. Well, um... well, i don't believe you, so i'm gonna just... why don't you tell me what happened here? Why don't you tell me what happened here? Nothing. Nothing happened. You fucked him. I can't even believe i'm saying that. [Laughs] oh! You fucked him, didn't you? Okay. Deee... [laughs] oh, that worst-case scenario, it's a mother-fucker, isn't it? Aah! [Cries] all right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So now what? You're gonna... [spits] ...live with him? No. No? You're gonna just fuck him and you're gonna live with me and then stop over there and borrow a cup of fucking -- what do you want?! I just want you to stop! Stop! Be careful what you wish for, baby. You're gonna get what you deserve. I just want it to stop! All right. Um, stop. It's over, and you broke my heart, and... you deserve each other, and... you're a lying bitch. And i want you to... get out. I guess that covers it, doesn't it? Come on. Manuel: hey! Hey! Hey! Look what i caught. [Crying] jenny, jenny. Let him go. Let him go. You don't need him anymore. Jenny: jack? Jack! Jack. He's still not back. He's still not back. Why do you keep doing this to yourself? Can you stop thinking about him at least for a moment or pretend that he's not around? You're gonna go crazy. He's not around. Let's dance. Dance? Yeah. I don't feel like dancing. Well, there's nothing to do here. We fight all the time. Let's just dance. We fight all the time. Let's just dance. There's no music. We'll make it. [Scatting] come on. [Gasps] what's going on? I don't know. Looks like he found something. Looks like a boat. [Gasping] you got the dinghy! Let me help you. Back off! What? Let me give you a hand. He's just trying to help you, jack. He's already helped himself. We just want to help you get off the island, jack. Let the sea take care of you. I'm doing fine. Thank you very much. Okay. Okay. That's jack. You never shared anything with anyone your whole life. I shared you, didn't i? I was never yours to share. You really think you can get out of here? You really think you can get out of here? You're gonna get yourself killed, jack. You don't know which way to go. North, northeast. We were motoring south, southwest when we sank. I'm gonna have the sail up. I'll be out of here by tomorrow. That quick? Why? You having second thoughts? Huh? Things aren't so great under the banyan tree? You don't have to be cruel, jack. You don't think what you did was cruel? I did what i had to do to survive. All right, then you're gonna have to screw me, too, all right, then you're gonna have to screw me, too, if you want to get out of here. Is that all it'll take? That's a hell of a start, baby. What are you saying, jack? You want us to have sex right now? Right now, yeah, right here. Yeah? Go to hell, jack! You wouldn't take me even if you could. It takes a heart to forgive someone. What do you know about heart?! Huh?! [Pounding] he must be in a big hurry to die. He's leaving tomorrow. Is that what he said? So you're still talking to him. How can i not? It's a small island. You want to go for a swim? It's beautiful at night. Look. There's a full moon. It's gorgeous. Come on. She tried to come back to me while you were out diving today, manuel! Said she wanted a ticket on the next boat out! Said she'd do anything to get aboard! Yeah, nice try, jack. Just ignore him. He's lying. Still want to go for that swim? Come on, i want to swim with you. Come on, last one in has to cook. Okay, sure. [Laughter] oh! Look, i told you -- beautiful! Come here. [Moaning] i think we should just take the boat, leave him here. Are you willing to do that? I don't want to be here anymore. But he lives on that boat. We could just take it while he's sleeping. What if he wakes up? Can't you just do something? Sure. [Moaning] hey, jenny, wake up. Hey, jenny, wake up. Wake up. What? He's gone diving down the beach. If you want to get out of here, this is the best time. You sure? Yeah. I checked the boat this morning. It's all ready. He's even made a sail. Come on. Take the coconuts. This way. I got it. Stay there and push. He's coming. Just push it. Just push it. Quick! It's okay. We're gonna make it. Get in. Get in. Hey! Hey! Ugh! Tha-- oh! Tha-- oh! Brrg! [Chuckles] he looked like a madman. He is a madman. Do you think he's gonna make it on his own? Who cares? I don't know why you care anymore. I don't. I don't. How long's it gonna take for us to get back? Maybe a couple of days. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. What is it? It's leaking. Let me see. Let me see. I've got it, okay? Can you fix it? Son of a bitch. What is it? He's rigged the boat to sink. He's trying to kill us. Get out of the way. Let me see. Let me see. How far out are we? Miles, miles. We're gonna have to swim back. I don't want to go back. I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch. I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch. Manuel. Manuel! [Breathes heavily] well, that took longer than i expected. You tried to kill us, jack. Ah, pish, pish. How could you do that? Where is he? I don't know. We got separated at the reef. Manuel! Manuel! Jack, what are you doing? Jack, don't. Hey. What are you gonna do? Hey, buddy. How's that swim? Shh, quiet. [Whimpers] [whimpers] how's that swim, pal? How we doing, ese? Stop! We good? Come on, boy, huh? No. No! Manuel! Ugh! Jack! No! Aah! No! Ugh! You're such a coward, jack! You're such a coward, jack! You waited till he swam all day before you had the courage to attack him. All's fair in love and war. To love and to hold. To... honor and cherish? For better or worse. Till death do us part. Or something weirder. Now, why does that look familiar? Hmm? Ohh! Amsterdam, 2001. What weren't you wearing? No, don't answer that. It's rhetorical. You know what i think? You know what i think? I think that maybe you and i, we should put on a little show for him, the way you did for me. Wouldn't that be sweet? Ooh, the mind reels at the possibilities. You're gonna have to consider this as a form of intervention, you know? Don't get me wrong. There's gonna be 12 steps, the first of which is gonna get a little freaky. The first of which is gonna get a little freaky. Ugh! Hit him, manuel! Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! [Water splashing] [groans softly] oh, my god. Oh, my god. Here, let me bandage them. We need to make weapons. What? Look at you. You've got a fever. It doesn't matter. We have to hide. No, i don't want to hide. I want to fight. We have to fight him. You ready to die for love, son? I'm ready for you. There's no nobler cause. Just stop it, jack. Someone's gonna come here sooner or later. You're gonna have to live with what you did here. What i did? He can't fight anymore. He's sick. He can't fight anymore. He's sick. You've made him sick. I'll show him sick. Aah! Manuel! Aah! Leave him alone! Stop it, jack. [Laughs] no! That's my girl. Aaaaah! Looks like someone built a hut. I'm sorry, ma'am. We didn't mean to disturb you. I'm sorry, ma'am. We didn't mean to disturb you. We didn't know anyone was here. Are you okay? I'm -- i'm great. I'm good. I can't believe somebody's here. How long have you been here? A year, maybe longer. Did you ever hear of what happened to the maratani? No, but we can go on the ship radio and find out. Come on, i'll take you. Okay. So, how'd you get here? I swam. I swam and i swam and i swam. I swam and i swam and i swam. We've got some chocolate-chip cookies if you want some. Yeah? Okay. Just tell them to leave you alone when you've had enough. Just tell them to leave you alone when you've had enough. They're adorable. I thought you might need this. I'm enjoying every minute with them. [Laughs] hey! All right! All right! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
