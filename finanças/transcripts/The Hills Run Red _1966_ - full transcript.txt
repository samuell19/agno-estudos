Ken! Mr. Ken Seagull. What do you want, Jerry? Why don't you quit counting that money? Ain't all yours, you know. $600,000 and all in one swoop. You know, Jerry, it'd buy a lot of land and horses. When I think this money was supposed to buy cannon, it gives me the creeps. You'll get the creeps if they get their hands on you. That's government money and don't you forget it. JERRY: Look at yonder, Ken. KEN: Go on, go on. Them Yankees are thicker than lice. (URGING HORSE) (URGING HORSE) There's no sense in letting them catch us both together. We'll draw cards. High card gets the money and escapes, low card gets the Yankees on his tail. Got the cards? I sure have. Here you are. Whoever gets the low card stays on the wagon. You ready? Sorry, Jerry. Well, get moving. They'll be here any minute. Ken, if I don't make it, take care of Mary and the boy. Kiss them hello for me. Don't you worry. Tell your tattoo that Uncle Ken will take care of everything. Good luck, Jerry. (EXCLAIMING) Drop your pistol, rebel. Your name? Houston. Jim Houston. Where's your friend? I got no friend. I'm alone. Lie. Where's the money? It's all I got. Can't find anything, Sergeant. Where did you hide the money? Tell me. Look, mister, the war is over. MAN: We'll make you talk. Where's the money? (GROANING) The war is over, mister? (HORSE NEIGHING) So, you're not talkin'. If you want it like this, fine. You'll talk in prison, rebel. MAN: What's the matter, boy? The sun bother you? (MAN LAUGHING) Well, you'll get used to it sooner or later. That is, unless you want to spend a little more time with us. Come here. Here's what you had five years ago. You better check it. We don't want any dissatisfied customers. One photograph. One gun belt. And a deck of cards. And that's all. No pistols, Houston. The government confiscated 'em. And about that $50 of yours, it went to buy you a horse and saddle. I got you a real good buy, though. Why, a horse like that would cost you at least $80 anywhere in Texas. Did you say 50 bucks for this nag? Not bad. Boy, look who's gettin' out. We're gonna miss you, fellow. And stay out of trouble. Telegram for Mr. Milton. It's urgent. Give it to me. Solamente Garcia Mendez can speak to Senor Milton, understand? Yes, sir. Vaya! What is it, Mendez? MENDEZ: For you, senor, from Fort Wilson. Is it anything serious? I've got to leave you, Mary Ann. I'll join you later. But, Ken... Have one of the men take my sister safely back to the ranch. Certainly, senor. If the senorita would permit. I will do it myself if the senorita will permit. KEN: No, no, Mendez. I need you. Send somebody else. I'm sorry, senorita . It would have been a great pleasure. Only for you, I'm afraid. Mendez. Brewster's free. We must move and act quickly. Select a couple of your best men and tell them to get after him. Send Randall. He's the only one we got who'll recognize him as soon as he sets eyes on him. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Now, what are your orders? For me, Brewster no longer exists. (HOME TO MY LOVE BY GINO PLAYING) ? I know a girl with golden hair ? Waiting by the window ? All alone ? I know my girl knows how I care ? Won't be long, my darling ? Soon be home ? But there's a high wind wailing in the plain ? As if I'll never see my girl again ? On my way home to my love! ? Back home to my love ? Back home to my love! ? Back home to my loving girl ? Say ? You're waiting, darling ? I know my girl ? Is always there ? Waiting by the window ? All day long ? My darling girl with golden hair ? Wait a little longer Mary. ? Won't be long ? Mary. (MUSIC BOX PLAYING) (GRUNTING) "The war is over. It ended a year ago "but we're still waiting for you. "I can't, I won't believe you're dead "as Seagull claims. "I love you too much, Jerry. "And down deep in my heart, "I feel that somewhere on this Earth you're trying to "get back home." MARY: "All our money is gone "and there's hardly enough food in the house "to keep us from starving. "If I can't make the payment on the mortgage "by the end of the month, "they'll turn me and the baby out. "Your friend, Ken Seagull, came back from the war "with a lot of money. "I don't know why, but he now calls himself Ken Milton. "I asked him for a loan for the sake of our friendship, "but he turned me down. "He says every man must look out for himself." "Oh, Jerry. "Oh, Jerry, darling. "I feel terrible. "So terrible. "If you were only here beside me." Seagull. Seagull! Seagull! Seagull! (GUNS FIRING) Come on. (GROANS) Come on out, Brewster. We've got you trapped. Hey, for you, my friend. Only two shots but better than nothin'. (GROANING) (GRUNTS) (BOTH GRUNTING) (BOTH GRUNTING) Was it Seagull who sent you? Was it him? Tell me or I'll cut your... My wife. Where is my wife and my son? Your wife is dead. Four years ago. Seagull took the boy away. Where's Seagull now? Where is he? Austin, Texas. Calls himself Milton. (SCREAMING) That's enough now. That's enough. I said, that's enough. He's dead. What more do you want from him? Come over here. I'll bandage your arm. I thought it was worse. It's just a scratch. What's your name? Does it matter? I like to know who I meet. My name is Winnie Getz. Getz, you say. Is helping your neighbor your calling, maybe? Well, let's just say I prefer distributive justice. Now, what the hell does that mean? There were two against one and armed to the teeth. Didn't seem quite fair. I see. Nothing else? No, not at first. But, uh, then I got me an idea. Yeah? And what was that? I heard what that fellow said, just before he died. And I reckon, uh, something good could come out of it. Somethin' real good maybe. I don't, uh... I don't get you. Well, you want to get your revenge, don't you? Yeah, go on. Well, to my mind, it'd be best for you if that fellow Seagull, or whatever he calls himself, thinks you're dead. Well, you're-- you're forgetting about the, uh, other guys when nobody shows up. Oh, somebody will show up. Who? Me, pardner. I'll spell out my story. I'll tell him I saw the fight, took a hand in it, killed you, but, uh, too late for the other two, of course. Just what do you expect to get out of this? Mmm. A reward, maybe, or a job. It just so happens that I'm out of work. No. Seagull would never fall for it. He'll fall for it if I can prove to him that you're dead. Just a minute. I've got something that could convince him. Sure. Sure, amigo , you got yourself a deal. You'll get all the proof you need. You really made up your mind to go through this, Brewster? What's the matter? You got a weak stomach? When he sees this, he'll have to believe you. It's gonna hurt. Is that so? (GASPING) All right, Getz. You've proved to me that you're smart and quick on the trigger. A lot more so than my own men. Ain't that right, Mendez? One moment, you are not going to believe this gringo's story? I believe in the proof, Mendez. And this gringo, as you call him, succeeded where your men just plain failed. I think he deserves a reward. Well, uh, it's like this, Mr. Milton. Money comes and goes and always brings a lot of trouble with it. I can ride and I can shoot. That tattoo mark there proves that clear enough. I'd rather have a nice, permanent, dependable job. Well said there, Getz. All right, you're hired. Mendez is happy to take you on. Right, Mendez? Oh, happiness is nothing, senor . I, I am in paradise. (PIANO PLAYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Come on, boys. Let's see some of them dollars of yours. I'm here to load my pockets with 'em. Yeah. That's my point. Well, I'm gonna shoot it all. Ladies and gentlemen! Here she is, folks. Fresh from her triumphant successes in Dallas and St. Louis. Hattie Gardner! (CROWD CHEERING) (PLAYING VIOLIN) ? Here's a song that's free and easy ? Come on, everybody, join and we'll sing it ? Tap your feet and clap your hands... MAN: Come on, roll them bones. Final roll. Hey, listen, pardner. I got a very urgent appointment 50 miles from here. I'll be seeing you. So long. ? What a very happy little song to be singing... ? What a very happy little gay little song... (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Seven wins. (MUMBLING) How do you like that? There she is. MAN 1: A winner with the seven. ? Come along and sing ? MAN 2: You'll lose your cash if you're not careful. (PEOPLE LAUGHING) MAN 3: Give him the dice. Stop. Hey. MAN 1: Seven again. (EXCLAIMING) Now, you listen to me, handsome. If you're figurin' on ruining my actin', I got a few things to say to you right now. (MEN LAUGHING) Now get away from here, prairie flower. Get your hands off me. Who do you think you are? Go back to your singing. This ain't no place for women. Hey, Sancho. SANCHO: I'll buy you a drink. Come over here. There's a big wad of dollars on the board just burnin' to come into my hands. Makes me sick. Seein' big bills give me indigestion. Mr. Horner, two of Mendez's men are down by the dice table. What do we do? I'll take care of it. Here she comes. We're gonna have a little surprise. Seven. I made a seven. You are great, Lofty. I always say so. That's a... What do you mean? You insinuatin' it ain't on the level? No. You see, I... Is that a seven or not on the table? Yes. Seven. Seven. That's better. Hey, you! Outside. What did you say? I said outside. And you can tell Mendez this saloon is out-of-bounds for his men. Get it? Out-of-bounds. Have it your way, Horner. The first man that moves will get plugged in the gullet. Sancho! (SCREAMING) (MEN MUTTERING) You get the hell out of here, both of you! Get the hell out of here! Look out! Take out those stiffs. Whiskey! Congratulations. By golly, I don't even know your name. Houston. Jim Houston. Well, your very good health, Mr. Houston. There's always a call for men like you here. Those coyotes of Mendez don't make life any too easy for us here. What's this Mendez all about? You mean, what's this Milton after. Well, Milton wants everything. He owns two-thirds of the land around here and he wants to get his hands on the rest of it. But I say no! And the other ranchers are with me. And how long are you gonna keep sayin' it? How about that, folks? How come nobody gave me a hand? Listen... You keep your hands off me. Milton's gettin' more power every day. When he can't get what he wants with blackmail and corruption, he resorts to violence. And nobody in town's got the courage to fight back. The sheriff was shot dead three months ago. And there ain't a man in the place with the guts to take his job. But I want to make you a proposition. Why don't you help us? I'll have to think about that. Right now what I need is a bed. Oh, um, by the way, where is this fellow Milton's ranch? Oh, that's not hard to find. Just head north out of Austin, and when you've forded the creek, the land's all his. Hey, why are you so curious? You aim to pay him a visit? Could be. (BOY GRUNTING) Howdy. Howdy. Say, was that you who hit that piece of iron in the air just now. Sure. I can do it any time I want. What's your name? Tim. Don't you think you're braggin' a little bit, Tim? That's a pretty hard thing to do. You got a dollar? Yeah, I reckon so. Then I'll make a deal with you. You throw it up in the air and if I hit it before it falls, the dollar's mine. Well, you drive a hard bargain, pardner, but it's a deal. Okay then? Okay. Ready? Who taught you how to make that sign? It's-- it's to bring luck. My pa used to make it. Your pa? Don't you want to bet now? Scared you'll lose your dollar? No, no, you won it. I knew you could do it. Where is your pa? In town? He died, a long time ago. But he was a great cowboy, even more than you. Sure. And you, you're with your ma now, are you? My ma is dead, too. Tim... Nino, run along. Go back to the village! (LAUGHING) What do you want? To meet you, stranger. They say that you put on one hell of a fight in Horner's Saloon last night. Unfortunately, I missed the performance. I lost two very valuable men. So you're Garcia Mendez. Right, senor. And now you will repeat the performance, out here in the open. Only the end will be different. Right, senor? Oh, no pistols, of course. It will be over too soon. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (CLANGING) (MEN GROANING) (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Go after him. Go and get him. Fight him like I taught you how to fight. Go after him. (PANTING) (GROANING) Shoot. Get it over with. (LAUGHING) I'm not going to kill you, stranger. You're a champion. And you don't kill champions, you raise them. And you're coming with me to the Mayflower Ranch, and you're hired for top dollar. Bravo! Bravo! I hope I'm lucky at this deal. Look, Mendez is here. MENDEZ: Juan. Pedro. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Take care of him. Go ahead. Round up a dozen good men and tell them to get ready because tomorrow or the day after tomorrow they run in with the herd at dawn. All right, chief. Did you hear Mendez? Nothing is hard for him. Sure. Twelve men for all these horses. As if Abilene was on the other side of the hill. He's crazy. Quit complainin'. We've been hangin' around for a month doing nothing. MAN 1: You talk too much. MAN 2: You're the one who's talking now. Take that guy inside and shut up. Good mornin', ma'am. Good morning. Will you harness Robbie please? Yes. No, not that one, the other one. JERRY: Mary! Mary! Mary! You can't leave me now! You can't leave me! (JERRY GROANING) Help me. Help me. Stay with me. Don't go. Who are you? I'm Mary Ann. I heard you call my name and... My brother is the owner of this ranch. Oh. I see, I'm... I'm sorry. You're in a pretty bad way. I'll send you some bandages and a clean shirt. Am I mistaken or are you new here? No, I... I was just hired by Mendez. Strange. You don't look at all like the type he usually hires around here. (LAUGHING) What type am I then? Well, I'll send you the bandages and the rest of the stuff. What were you doing in there? That's no business of yours. He's one of my men, and your brother has given me full authority over them. Do you want to know something, Mendez? One of these days you'll have to find a new job. And you know why? Because I'll have you thrown out of Mayflower. You're going to fall in love with me. Jerry. Jerry. What the devil? Never mind. Where you been? I've been expecting you all day. Now, wait a minute. It wasn't easy, you know. But everybody's asleep now. Listen, Winnie. I've been figurin' how to help those townspeople square accounts with Ken Seagull. He's robbed them blind, took their land, even killed off their sheriff. And what are you gonna do about it? Ride to Austin tonight. I can disappear and nobody should notice I'm gone. Will you help me? All right. Just sit tight for a while. I'll keep things covered. Don't worry. (NEIGHING) (TAPPING ON WINDOW) Holy smoke. If you're not careful, one day somebody's gonna put a bullet through your guts. Well, I didn't want anybody to see me so I came up the shortest way. They fixed you up real pretty, didn't they? Listen, Horner, yesterday you made me a proposition. Now, do you still feel the same way about it? Sure do. Go on. Tomorrow at daybreak two-thirds of Milton's horses will be movin' out toward Abilene with only a dozen of Mendez's men ridin' herd on them. It's a chance for you to get back part of what he robbed from you. If you agree, your men and me, well, we'll fix those buzzards. I see. What you're suggesting means more bloodshed. It won't be the last. I stand alone now. Ken's broken their spirits, they're all afraid. But there is no other way, Horner. Can't you understand that? Milton won't stop at anything until he has wiped you out. Now, he has to be destroyed before it's too late. Is that the only reason? You really hate him, right? That's right. Well, I can't say that I blame you. (CREAKING) (SHUSHING) (GASPING) What are you doing up at this hour? You ought to be in bed. I heard some noise and I thought someone was here. Well, I guess I was wrong. Good night. Good night. Well, Houston, what do you want us to do? Simple. Fight. All right. We'll play it your way. It's our last chance to save our necks. I'll have to convince the others. (MEN URGING HORSES) (HORSES NEIGHING) (MEN URGING HORSES) (MEN SCREAMING) (SINGING IN SPANISH) We've been double-crossed. Ambushed. Men and horses, killed. MENDEZ: Get those horses. MENDEZ: Now! How are your wounds today? Much better. MENDEZ: Pedro! By the way, I... I want to thank you for yesterday. You were very nice to me. Maybe even too nice. MENDEZ: You come with me! What's the matter with him? I don't know. It seems like Horner played a dirty trick on some of his men. Horner's a murderer. My brother has to live shut up in the house like a prisoner since Horner started persecuting him. What do you know about it? I can use my head, too. Besides, Ken tells me everything. How long you been living with your brother? Three years. Before that I was in Spring Inn, with my aunt. Why do you ask? Nothing. No reason, Mary. Ann. This time Horner's gonna pay for it. I won't stand for it. He can't do this. He can't do this to me. Pablo. Pablo! Pablo, get rid of this blood. We must move into action, immediately. If Horner and the sheep he leads get ideas into their heads, all of us and everything we've been fightin' for will be wiped out forever. Forever, understand. Senor, in this life there are those who talk a lot, and those who keep their hatred and the desire for vengeance hidden in their hearts. I promise you that Horner will regret the day he was born. I promise you that he will lose five of his men for every one of my hombres killed. And I promise you that I will discover who betrayed us and I will kill him with my own hands. (MEN URGING HORSES) Now, we will divide up into small groups and ride into town without arousing suspicion. The signal will be when I walk into the saloon. Then you're on your own, and remember, they gunned down your friends and your brothers and never gave them a chance. Ramirez, you go along the river and then come into the town from the south. Pedro, you bring your men from the east. Sancho, you move into the town from the top of the slope. And you, amigo, you come with me. How does that please you? (EXCLAIMING) (CLANKING) What's the matter? I don't know. Something wrong with his hoof. It's a hell of a time to find that out. Well, I better have it looked at. MENDEZ: Okay, but hurry up. Be only a minute. Got a bad hoof. Yeah. I'll look at it. Tim. Hey, Tim. Howdy. You want to bet another dollar? I'll give you two if you take this note to Brand Horner right away and don't let anybody see you. Understand? It's important. Very important. Okay? I'll go but not for the $2. Why not? Because you're good. Hey, Tim. (SHOUTING) (LAUGHING) He's all right. I can't understand what was bothering him. Houston. Yeah. How long you gonna keep me waiting? Just a minute. So long. This ain't no place for kids. What do you want? I've got to deliver a note to Mr. Horner. You get out of here. Mr. Horner's busy. But I got to see him. It's very important. I said he was busy. Now get out of here. You said you had a message for Mr. Horner, didn't you? Where is it? What is it? A love letter? Could be. Why? You jealous? What the hell could I do about it? There's too many of us. I'll take you to Mr. Horner. Come along. Let's go, Houston. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (GUNS FIRING) (MEN GROANING) (MENDEZ'S MEN WHOOPING) (GROANING) Houston. It's all over with me. I'm finished. They'll kill me, all because of your crazy idea. My note. Didn't you get my note? What note? I don't know what you're talking about. This way, quick. I'll cover you. Keep your head down. (SHUDDERING) MAN: Come on out with your hands up. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Where's Horner? He's not here. Sorry about that. Tim ain't been back since yesterday. But that don't bother me none. If he wants to come back, he knows the way. I fed him, I clothed him. But you know how these little kids are. Ungrateful whelps. It don't do to make sacrifices for them. It just ain't worth it. (VIOLIN PLAYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Well, I reckon this ain't the right season for it, Mrs. Jones. I reckon you're right. Well, they're all havin' a lot of fun, wouldn't you say? Yeah. Do you know where Houston is? I haven't seen him all day. I'll tell you what. For you, I'll go look for him. (ALL CHEERING) SANCHO: Drink! Drink! You! You keep your hands off her. Why do you push me away for? Why do you push me away? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Pedro! Pedro! Where's Houston? Why is he not drinking here with us? Ain't seen him around since this morning, come to think about it. Well, quit hanging around here. Go find him quickly. Go ahead. (BOTH LAUGHING) Amigo. Hey, amigo. Where have you been? Oh, just, uh, messin' around. I don't much like parties. Yes, but this is a fantastic party. Listen. We're celebrating the end of Horner. Doesn't the idea appeal to you? Well, I better get cleaned up a bit. I got half the trail's dust on me. Oh, no, you come with me. A drink for my friend and make it quickly. Because my friend is a very big drinker. Drink for everyone! Drink to our victory. Thanks. I, uh, I don't feel like drinking. You will drink because I say so. Now, just a minute. What does that mean? That you do not want to drink to our victory? It means that I don't want a drink. That's all. MENDEZ: Maybe so. Maybe so. But some people say that you did not fire a single shot at Horner's men. And some say more than that. Some say that you're in Horner's pay. Who says? I do. And I can prove it. Pedro! (TIM GRUNTING) Who brought him here? (SPEAKING SPANISH) I did. You didn't expect that, did you? Who gave you that message? Answer me! Hands off, Mendez. I gave him the message. Me. You dirty, bloody... Why did you do it? Why? Look at me, Seagull. Take a good, long look. Don't you recognize me? The man whose wife you killed. And who spent five long years in prison so you could wallow in your stinkin' money. That's why I did it. So one day I could see you crawlin' on your knees beggin' for mercy. And then... Then I would crush you like a worm! Mendez. Call them off. Call back your boys, Seagull, or I'll kill you. Tim, get the horse. (GUNS FIRING) (MEN CLAMORING) Kill him, Mendez. Kill him, kill him. Stop your firing. Get those horses. (SCREAMING) I can do it. You stay right here. Okay. Tim! Come down. Hi, amigo. If you're lookin' for Horner, you can keep on looking for quite a spell because he's lit out, bag and baggage, together with all the rest of the God-fearin' citizens. We're alone. Alone in a cemetery named Austin. Well, what are you waitin' for? Why don't you catch up with them? Well, our paths have been runnin' alongside each other for quite some time now. No, Getz. This means everything to me. It's the reason why I live, why I breathe. Everything I've done, I've done just to get right here to this showdown. But for you, it's--it's different. You still have time so just... Just wipe Seagull out of your head and get the hell out of here. You're talkin' too much, boy. In a few minutes, Mendez will be here with all the men he can round up. And what do you think we're gonna stop him with, your gab? Winnie Getz. Listen, Timmy, you have to prove to me that you're a real man, and a real man must obey orders when it's necessary. Now, you stay here, quiet like a mouse and still as a cactus, no matter what happens. Promise. Okay, then. Okay. Here, I found a whole arsenal down in the cellar including some charges of dynamite. I've already arranged for a reserve on the roof. So I'll, uh, receive Senor Mendez from up there. You watch out for the street level, huh? Si. Oh, Brewster. (HORSES NEIGHING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (GUNS FIRING) Juan, Pedro. Get him! Shoot him! Dismount! Cowards, you want to die like dogs? Hurry up. Two of you after him. (SCREAMING) Go after him. (MAN SCREAMING) There he is. On the roof. Go after him. Get him, damn it! There he is. Go after him. Estupidos! Don't let him get away! Come on, he's run out of dynamite. It's just wax candles. Look! Look. Come on! (SPEAKING SPANISH) Where'd he go? Right here, you yellow-bellies. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (CREAKING) WINNIE: Except for Mendez and the two that got away, I think we got everyone of 'em, Brewster. I'll catch up with them at Mayflower. I'll go with you. Private affair, Winnie. You take care of Tim. Go get some fresh horses, and be quick about it. What's going on, Mendez? My brother refuses to talk to me. There is no time now, beautiful. We will discuss it in Mexico. Because you're coming with me. MARY: No! Let me go. You're not goin' off with her. You're not goin'. (GROANS) Mendez! (MEN GROANING) (GROANING) Give up, Mendez. I... I... I didn't know. Pablo. Senor? (GREETING IN SPANISH) (GRUNTING) (GROANING) Seagull! Stand up, Seagull. Drop your gun, Brewster. This is the second time you've drawn the wrong card. You figured to destroy me. I gotta disappoint you. Again. Can I look you in the face, Seagull? Sure you can. I want to see you spit out your soul, Brewster. (GUN FIRES) (GUNS FIRING) (COCKING) (KEN GASPING) You will consign the ranch and all it contains to the governmental authorities, Colonel, in compensation for the theft suffered by the State five years ago. Very well, Colonel. As far as the perpetrators of the robbery are concerned, Ken Seagull died in a gun fight. And, uh, Jerry Brewster... Jerry Brewster died about a month ago. I, myself, will sign both death certificates. But as for Houston, for his voluntary aid in the cause of justice, and availing myself of the special powers invested in me by the State, I confer upon him the Sheriff's star of the city of Austin with the hope that peace and justice may never again abandon this town. And that, gentlemen, completes my assignment. (HOME TO MY LOVE BY GINO PLAYING)
