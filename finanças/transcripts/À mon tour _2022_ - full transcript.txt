THE PROBLEM IS TO CULTIVATE THE BEST AND ELIMINATE THE WORST. -Hello, Jocasta. -Hello. -Nice sculpture, and nice dress! -Thanks. Hello. How are you? Hello, Berthe. Hello. Where's your tie, son? Come on, go put one on. Hello! How are you? -Hello. -Put your jacket on! Dress properly, for God's sake! -Hello, Colette. Very nice. -Thank you. Hello, Josiane. How are you? MY TURN You're wearing your sash like a deputy, dear. Thank you, my love. -No. Where's Jocasta? -She just left. Mrs. De Ponte, you'll join your husband onstage -with the kids after the speech. -Alright. How are you, Philippe? The sculpture is magnificent, Jocasta has outdone herself. Yes, it packs a punch on the main square. Good thing too, given how much it cost! The artwork was financed by the 1% of public works companies we place orders with. -And Philippe paid for it, so relax! -OK, we have to go. He can afford it, he's been billing the city for 12 years. He's the best. Why shouldn't we use his services? Once I'm elected mayor, my calls for tenders won't be shams. Your candidacy is a sham. Take that sash off, you're not city councilor. Don't wear it in the mayor's presence. Scheming before our very eyes... I'll pat your head and thank you. Come on. You both look great. You look very chic and elegant. CITY HALL Today, we wish to honor harmonious coexistence in our city, represented by this renovated square and this artwork, which we're about to discover. Jocasta... you're a famous sculptor, young man, sorry, I mean, young woman. And despite your success, you've remained loyal to us. For almost ten years, you've adorned the public domain of Châteauneuf. Thank you! My dear citizens of Châteauneuf-sur-Valone, I'll use this beautiful day on which we have all gathered to announce that I am once again a candidate for mayor of our great city! -Yes! -Well done! I could never thank you enough for the trust you show in me. I am proud to be your mayor! I have Châteauneuf in my blood! Bravo! Come here, Jocasta. Well done, it's spectacular. Let's stand all together. De Ponte! De Ponte! De Ponte! Thank you. Thank you. -How are you? -Great. What a pretty picture! -When are you due? -Very soon. How wonderful! You're the future of Châteauneuf. -Congratulations. -Thank you. Mrs. Marciano, how are you? Congratulations, Mr. Mayor! They're going to cut off my water! Really? Well, don't worry. Here. Take this. Thank you, Mr. Mayor! Hey, watch it! -What's his problem? -Rocky! Be nice! OK, then... Bye, thank you. De Ponte! De Ponte! De Ponte! Wake up, Mr. Mayor. You sure got home late. Yes, I had to work late with Eloi. Here goes the six-month marathon. More like a six-month pregnancy. Better get back into shape, honey! I'll take the bike. The bike won't be enough. You have to do sports again! Right away! -No, not the dog! -Yes, the dog. Down, girl! Go back to your doghouse! WHEN IT RAINS, IT POURS What are you doing here at this hour? Hello, Mr. Mayor. Sorry to bother you but I have a search warrant. What's this about? Go on, you can get started. Could you tell me what's going on? DE PONTE: CORRUPTION, FROM FATHER TO SON "Philippe Lamache, a Public Works boss "more generous to the mayor than to his own employees." "Félix De Ponte: like father, like son. "Commissions for public procurement, luxurious holidays with friends." They got you good! I thought Est Éclair was on your side. Well, they'll do anything just for the buzz. This journalist is well informed! She lists all the holidays we've had with the Lamaches for ten years! Thailand, Bali, Courchevel, the Maldives... Exactly how much house renovations cost... She even mentions the Tivoli-stone shower! What the hell? How does she know all this? Our entire lives, for everyone to see! It's not very hard to get that kind of info. What's this about commissions? Did you borrow money from Philippe? No! Why would I do that? Reading this is driving me crazy, Félix! It'll fizzle out! I'm not my father. -I'll never be like him. -Good thing too! I was woken up by a guy in gloves! I thought I had Covid again! -What's he doing? -I don't know. Léon! Dad! Where's the chocolate box with all the money? I don't see it! Léon, cut it out! Sorry, I don't know where he gets it. We'll find out. He's just at an awkward age. He hangs around like a teen in the backyard shed and empties the fridge twice a day. Come on, seriously? I can assure you, Chief, I don't have any cold, hard cash. Hiding money in freezers is quite common. Toilet tanks work well too. People have no imagination. Would you like a coffee? "Would you like..." Kiss-ass! There's no need to piss her off, either! Best to keep a low profile. Why? Is there something you forgot to tell me? No! What else could there be? Come on, honestly... Come on, kids, move it! Go get ready. I'm here, my love. We're indestructible, OK? Are you sure we're forced to tell my parents? OK, I'll do as you say... Mr. Mayor! Putting aside what we've found in your son's shed... You have to come to the precinct with me, Mr. Mayor. It's 8:15 a.m., you're officially in police custody. You can't accuse me based on an article that's only based on rumors! Two boxes full of rumors? That's a lot. -Shall we? -No, not the handcuffs! This reminds me of the last time I saw grandpa. How old was I? Huh? Uh, you were ten. Don't worry, it'll be tough, but it'll be fine after you split up. What are you talking about? Splitting up? I dreamt that you and Dad were getting divorced. That's absurd, honey! It was a nightmare, not reality. Man is the nightmare of reality. That's great, honey. You should go back to school. No way! Just a bunch of literature nerds. Why should I study if everything's going to shit? Carpe diem! No risk of that. There's an exam and you have 0% chance of passing. What does "carpe diem" mean? -It's Latin for slacker. -No, Paul! It means, "enjoy life." There you go. We're 300% in deep shit, Mom! Can't we take your maiden name? Paul, stop it! Your father will be proven innocent, I'm sure of it. But 95% of political men who've had legal problems move to another city. -The opinion polls say so. -OK, stop it! Got it? Let's go! Go clean up your bamboo. But they took everything, those assholes! We are going to school. Holidays paid for by the princess? Fine. But the money Lamache sent you through tax havens to buy your father's house and pay for the renovations? That will be hard to justify, a friendly loan. Especially since it's Lamache's company who did the work. You paid him back? It's like having a butcher loan you some money so you'd buy his meat. It was for Rose. She thinks I borrowed from the bank. If that's all, you're fine. I've saved worse cases than you. I don't think they have anything on the public procurement kickbacks, They're bluffing. Anything else I should know? No. No. Pass me your phone, I'll call Rose. Does she know anything? No. Come on, your phone. Well, I should show you... a photo that's been going around since this morning. Oh, no! Well... This is private stuff. Shit! Yes, it's annoying, but at least it's not... Well, it's annoying. Shut up. Fine... IF THE TRUTH HURTS, IT'S THE TRUTH'S FAULT. Stay on the garden, OK? Everything ready, guys? Battery? Keep going. Go on, get closer. Don't stop, keep going. Keep quiet, deny everything, even with your back against the wall. OK... Good dog. You know me! I'm the Mayor! Shush! Stop it! Ow! It's me! Honey, there you are. I thought that... -What? -That... -That I was gone? -Of course not. Why do you say that? What's the occasion? The end of your custody, my love. Look, I got the nice De Ponte tableware out. I'm really sorry about the photo with Jocasta. At that angle, it looked like we were kissing! When was it? Last night? Yes, I brought her phone, she'd left it at the office. Then, I went to work with Eloi. They'll do anything to take me down. Who's "they"? Molmont, the journalist. She's new, looking for a scoop. Are the kids here? No. Paul and Elsa are at my father's, Léon is with friends. With the journalists at our house... Rose, are you OK? I'm fine. How are you? -Fine. -Champagne? -Let me do it. -No, I'll do it myself. Oh, no! Your grandmother's Murano chandelier! I'm so sorry! It's fine. No, you're right, it's fine. Who cares, right? We're indestructible, aren't we? Yes. We've been through a lot. -Here, my love. -I'm glad you're so calm about it. I won't be pushed around. I'll bite back at them. I can't wait to see it. To us. -I love you. -Is that all? I love you... with great passion. Really, is that all? You have nothing else to say? Fine, it wasn't the bank, Philippe lent me the money for the house. I wanted to pay him back... You goddamn piece of shit bastard! How long have you been fucking her? -You never talk to me that way. -Shut up! I'll talk how I want! I'm such an idiot! An idiot! I'd forgotten you were a De Ponte. Just like your father! Is it in your blood, isn't it? Manipulating, lying, cheating... I'm sick and tired of the De Pontes! I'm emptying this whole house, everything's got to go! Rose! Rose, come on... No! You'll get what's coming to you! I'm fed up with the De Pontes! Rose, enough! Stop it! -That feels so good! -Are you crazy? -Here! -Rose! Stop it! Stop it, Rose! There you go! And your ancestors... this bunch of phonies watching us! -Him! I can't stand him! -No, not Maximilien's painting! That girl has been living here for ten years! You've been cheating on me for ten years! When I see her with you onstage, next to that disgusting phallic sculpture! And you say, "I have Châteauneuf in my blood!" Isn't it that whore you have in your blood? -Stop, Rose. Let me explain. -Explain what? How you thought I was a fool? You've been lying for ten years! The house, renovations, all lies! I had no choice! My father left me with a pile of debt! I didn't want to worry you. It was best to keep you out of it. Didn't want to worry me? How cute! And you didn't want to fuck that whore, but did it anyway? Jocasta? But... Put that down, it's from Napoleon III! Please! Put it down! I made a mistake, fine! I don't know what came over me. Give me one good reason and I'll put it down. One! I love you, Rose, the love of my life. Oh, really? And you go do the nasty with someone else? Don't be so vulgar! Answer me, goddamn it! I don't know why! We don't do it on purpose. Our damn reptilian minds push us into polygamy! We're living longer now, how can we stay faithful for 60 years? Let me just say, the more I saw her the closer I felt to you. No! Rose! Stop! They're coming! This is for us, guys! Give us a smile! -Hello, there! -Hello. As you've surely heard, my husband and I have had a very honest conversation. About what, Mrs. De Ponte? By mutual agreement, we've decided to separate. Temporarily! I wish to protect my family while the police do their work... I'm not finished! Thank you. I'll divorce him, but I'm still a De Ponte. My children should be proud of their last name. And in order to prove to them and the people of this city that "De Ponte" is not necessarily a synonym for corruption, I've decided to run for Mayor of Châteauneuf-sur-Valone. You'll run against your husband? Absolutely! I will run against Mr. De Ponte. -Mr. De Ponte, a statement? -No. A platform? "MY WIFE IS A POLITICIAN. A reaction, Mr. De Ponte? No. Once again, we must tolerate the theatrics of the De Pontes, playing the psychological drama of divorce and who try, behind the scenes, to keep the Mayor's position within their family. Don't be fooled, dear friends, Mrs. De Ponte is nothing more than her husband's puppet. There we have it. Mr. Mayor, I ask you to bear the consequences of your actions, to resign, and to convince Mrs. De Ponte to go back to what she does best: raising her children and teaching history. Bravo! Thank you, Mr. Molmont-Martinez for your misogyny-filled remarks. You're showing your muscles, which is normal for a gym teacher! I'll avoid asking this assembly if you're competent enough to sit among us! Mr. Mayor, I demand that you immediately withdraw those remarks that insult both myself and my profession. I won't withdraw a thing! Not my remarks, or my candidacy for reelection! How shameful! You should be ashamed! It's shameful! You should be ashamed! Bravo! -Shameful! -Get out! Mr. Mayor, may I offer you some chocolate? I can't resist, they are truly excellent. Don't resist, please. This is a true institution. We're very proud. Very proud. That's so good! No pushing, please. Here, Eloi. For you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Go on, try some. -It's good. -Hello! How are you? I love this place, they focus on the product. You must respect the product. I think people want high quality. That's Inès Bertrand, Est Éclair journalist. What's your reaction to Mrs. De Ponte running? It's great, all part of the democratic game. I owe all this fame to you, actually. I just did my job. And if I can bring you even more fame, I won't hesitate. -Move forward, please. -Hello! How are you? -Mr. Mayor! -Move forward. -Mrs. Marciano, how are you? -Mr. Mayor! I'm fine. But Rocky is very troublesome. Really? What's the matter? He eats enough for four people! It's expensive. I've prayed for you, Mr. Mayor! I'm sure it will all work out. How kind of you, thank you. May God hear you. You'll see. Would you have 50 euros to spare, like last time? Fifty euros? Unfortunately, no. My pockets are empty, despite all the rumors! Mr. Mayor, do you hand money out like that often? Does he help you out often? Yes, very often! I have such a small pension. And in exchange, he asks you to vote for him? No! So many crooks out there! But him? He's nice! Thank you. I'll vote for you, Mrs. De Ponte. After everything your husband has done, -you're very brave to run for mayor. -How nice of you, Caroline. Well, then... speak of the devil! -Hello, there. -Your dad's here, honey. -Mr. Mayor? I didn't see you. -Hello. -How are you? -Fine. -Some saucisson? -I'll take some ham. Thank you. Very tasty, I love it! Yes, clearly! He goes up a size each year! My wife and her famous comebacks! Could your electoral rolls merge during the second round? -Why not? -Certainly not! You can't keep recycling the same thing. Funny, coming from the daughter of Communist activists who'd spend every summer in Yugoslavia. Her father even met Marshal Tito several times. Talk about an example! What my ex-husband has said is what I'm tired of in politics: cheap shots, bringing up the past, remarks that destabilize opponents... All that is over! My wish is to rebuild a Châteauneuf community that is peaceful and serene, for joy and kindness to be priorities and for us to listen to each other. Ladies, gentlemen! Enough questions, please step back. You point out my weight, then condemn cheap shots? You learn fast. Love you, honey. Thank you, ma'am! -I learnt from you, dear. -Eloi? -Let's go. -Yes, Mr. Mayor. "Yes, Mr. Mayor!" Like a puppy. Find out her schedule, I don't want to bump into her anymore. That'll be tricky, she improvises! She's well ahead in polls. -Beginner's luck! -More than that, she's blessed! What about the campaign team? We've got no one! We need people to put up posters, pamphlets... Many volunteers joined your wife. When I call, they yell at me! What's wrong with you? Where's your spirit? I don't recognize you anymore. We'll work all night, but we'll figure it out. No one's backing you! We're broke, out of campaigners, struggling with the roll. We've had worse. Not really! When your dad took the money, you should've just been poor, we wouldn't be in this mess! Shit! COURAGE MEANS NOT BEING SCARED. How many roundabouts are there on this road? It's making me seasick! You're the one who had them built, you needed the cash. Can you slow down, please? Going faster feels good. Right... OK. Do you have it? Yes. -Is it all here? -Thirty thousand. Can't we take a break? You're tired? No, I meant the payments. Now's not a good time, I need money for... No, I don't want to know! We've always agreed on that. Did you rat me out? I'll forget what you said for our friendship's sake, Félix. And here's some advice: lay low for a while. I'm sorry about what you're going through. But stop kidding around, seriously. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL What? Dad, what are you doing here? You won't pick up the phone, so I have to be bold. I'm sorry but I'm swamped. You thought you could change him. But he's a De Ponte, I warned you! You want me to say you were right? You were right! There, happy? You really impressed me, you know? Running against him like that! But you should take your maiden name back. It's a Moreno who should conquer the mayor's office, not a De Ponte. Grandpa! Who do we have here? My little princess! Are you coming home? Dad will be there. No, he'll come another time, dear. Shall I drive you home? No, Elsa wants me to stay. -Isn't that right, Elsa? -Yes! You hear that? Go on, honey. We'll make meatballs. Mr. Mayor! Nice to see you here. -Would you like a drink? -I don't have time. -Why are you here? -And you? -You eat Vietnamese food? -Why not? I like these people, they're polite. -I'll come back. -The envelope. I forgot all that. It's my platform. M. Tran is thinking of joining my electoral roll. I can't, I'm not French. Yes, you can! You have naturalization now. Uh, yes... Yes, I've applied for it. Right. But it's a long, long process. Yes. Let me know if you want me to speed it up. Are you struggling to complete your roll? Not at all! We've had to reject some. Good. If it goes trilateral, the polls say I'd win. Sure! I'll be reelected even in a wheelchair! More like a broom wagon! Ladies and gentlemen, give a round of applause for the star, the Mozart of kickbacks, the chaos artist: Félix De Ponte! Just watch TV, it suits your age. It's not my TV, so not my carbon footprint. Ferdinand. Félix. Did you fall off your bike? I never fall, you know that. Right, well, you're soaked up to your neck. Hey, grandpa's on TV! -I'm right here! -Not you, the other one! The De Ponte's family finances were already a well-kept secret. Jean-Charles De Ponte was the man with all the inside information, the trust of the President and ministers, and rounds of loud arguments during city council meetings at Châteauneuf-sur-Valone. And we all know him as the man who fled his country's justice. No one has seen trace of him since. Some believe he's in hiding somewhere, perhaps with the famous Dupont-Xavier. Others believe he's living very comfortably enjoying himself in a tax haven somewhere. Are you OK? Can I go shower? Sure. You still have some things upstairs, you can bring them down. Yeah... Apparently, he was a real scoundrel. Sorry, got to do my job. -Hi, everyone! -Hi. Well? Any news? Should I lock it? Or can I trust you? Sure. -Hello! -Hello. Come in. Could you please leave that in the kitchen? The pizzas are here! Kids, come and eat! Let's take a seat! Hello. -Help your mother. -Yes, Dad. -Right here? -Yes. You're the talk of the town, Mr. Mayor. Could have done without it. But you're famous now, that's good. You might even be minister. Bonuses for scandals? That's all over now. Well, politicians are like brands: the more famous the name, the more people buy. -An expert on pizza and politics! -He's right. He is! De Ponte is an excellent brand. -Are you from Châteauneuf? -Yes. From Valone, Maximilien de Ponte's town. Yes, I know it well. We never see you there. With my responsibilities as mayor, I have little time. No time to come visit? In two whole mandates? Well, you know, location work is one thing... Don't bother, we're used to it. What's two mandates, 12 years? Goes by fast. To forgive you, will you let me take a selfie? With pleasure! I'll count to three and we'll say, "bakchich." One, two, three... Bakchich! Thank you. I'm hungry! Yes, let's eat. Universal basic income is stupid! A worker with no job is no longer a worker! Aren't we humans first, before being workers or minions? You wouldn't get it, Grandpa, you're a commie! You favor a productive society. You're the capitalists' best friend! Hey! Have you seen how this guy talks? If you weren't my grandson, I'd smack you! Dad! Léon! Can't we eat without talking politics for once? It's fine, we disagree on everything, like all families do. What we should do is stay united, in solidarity. Alright, kids... Your father is here because we have an announcement. You're getting divorced. Not right away but... Yes, Dad will live somewhere else. I'd stay but your mother... Félix, please don't complicate things. Don't you think running against me complicates things? -If I may give some advice... -Not from you, thank you. Mom, why are you running against Dad? Why am I running against your father? He's betrayed everything we promised to each other: loyalty, honesty... He chose to follow his father's path. It's time for 'De Ponte' to become a proper noun. Well done, dear. We'll do politics differently. If Grandpa's on the list, I doubt it! The Return of the Politburo. We'll present ourselves without a label! The Masked Politburo! -That's enough, both of you! -Are the rumors about you true? Yes and no. It's complicated, you know? So, it is true! Paul, you're angry and I understand why. You're not responsible for my actions. You don't have to defend me. Tell your classmates that you disapprove of what I did. You can even support your mother against me. All three of you have the right to be sad. You can cry, yell at me, refuse to see me, hate me... But that changes nothing for me. Because I love you, all three of you. You're my own flesh and blood. I'll always be there for you. For Rose too, even if she doubts it. Hey! The delivery guy took a video, not a photo! You're going viral! What? Come see! I'll count to three and we'll say, "bakchich." One, two, three... Bakchich! What does "bakchich" mean? Dad, now we have a 200% chance of getting ripped apart at school. What came over you, Félix? I don't know! I thought it was a selfie. He said, "a selfie"! I didn't know he was filming! Wait... he stole your jersey? I got this from De Ponte, you saw me with him. I'll start the bidding at 300 bucks. Get in touch, let's do business. -He stole my jersey. -No, I gave it to him. What? Why would you do that? You looked ridiculous, squeezing into it! Calm down, it's just a jersey. It's not "just a jersey"! It's not just a jersey! You can't do that! You should have asked me! Ask you what, exactly? Hey! You should be thanking me, the buzz from these videos will get you some likes! If I'd known, I'd have thrown your damn jersey in the trash! Hello! I'm looking for Gabin Diop. Bakchich! No way, it's really you, in the flesh! -Is Gabin Diop here? -He lives on the 12th floor. We'll show you. -Guys, Bakchich is here! -Bakchich, my man! Bakchich is in town, guys! The mayor is here, my man! Here, Mr. Bakchich. Let's have some fun! We'll get along great, sir! -Is that the elevator? -That's it. Sir, don't do that! There's no elevator? Not since I was born. -Which floor was it? -Twelve. Ten plus two. -Right... -It'll help you lose weight! Then, grandmas will vote for you! They like the hotties! -Yes? -Hello, ma'am. Mr. De Ponte? Does Gabin Diop live here? Yes. What are you doing here? How did you find me? The kids downstairs told me. -You told them my name? -Yes. Why? -How did you get here? -By car. -Your car? -Yes, my car. I'll go now. Where are we going? Hey! -Shh! -What's wrong? What don't you understand about "shh"? What's wrong? -Nothing. That's suspicious. -Nothing wrong is suspicious? My car! My car was right there. Really? They took everything. No more car, no keys... They took it all. I'll go get my bike, you can't stay here. Shit! Someone help me! What's up? That's Didou, my friend's dog. He's usually friendly. It's me, I have an issue with dogs. They don't like me. They have good instincts. You don't mind, dogs don't vote. You can let go of the door, he doesn't know the code. We'll wait up here until night before you leave. I really had... a hard time finding you. Do you still have my jersey? Yes, at home. A big champion gave me that, give it back. -Right. It has sentimental value? -Yes. I get it, a big champion... I'll respect that, I'll give it back. Thank you. But I'll keep the 30,000 bucks! The champion didn't give you that. I need that back too. If not, what will you do? Call the police? -I'd rather not. -Right. Either way, I don't have them. -What? -I've got loans, bills, the family needs money. You gave it away? All 30,000 bucks? No! Just tell yourself you did a good deed. As a thanks, I'll invite you. Let's get a delivery from this incredible gourmet choice made up mostly of pizza and kebab. Go ahead, I've got 18 euros left. So, this is a kebab? You've never seen one before? What do you think? I'll go check it out. Fuck this town! Fuck your mother! Shit, they'll be there all night. Who's that guy? Dimitri and his crew. They're in charge here. -He's not that tough. -Maybe, but he's real dangerous. -I'm getting my car. -No! You're not getting anything, stay here! If not, it's my ass on the line. Those little shits can't push me around! Are you nuts? You may be Mayor, but here, you're a nobody! You have no reason to be here! We'll see about that. I'll stay here, at your place. I don't think so. You're going home. My wife kicked me out. Then, sleep at City Hall. They must have a room for you. Hey, for 30,000 euros, you could try a little harder. I'm not asking for a five-star bed and breakfast, but still. Where are you going? You'll sleep in my sister's room. -She's not here? -No. She left to join her husband in Syria. That's horrible! I could help you, I know people in Foreign Affairs. No point. She's always in a niqab, even when brushing her teeth. -Really? -Gabin, stopping fooling around. He was falling for it, Mom! "I have contacts in Foreign Affairs!" My daughter is a jurist in England. She couldn't find work here. -She should have come to me. -Right. You would have hired a black jurist with a nose piercing and tattoos? Yes. And if I came to you, what would you offer me? Other than security guard or garbageman. It depends on your studies. In France, no one gets sidelined. That damn political talk, it's incredible! You can only talk in slogans. Can't you stop pretending that people like us don't have a glass ceiling? No, you can't. Our glass ceiling is your floor. You never look down. We play the game, we study, to do what? Clean or deliver pizza. And you don't want that to change. Enough, Gabin. Go get some pillows. Don't take it personally, he's angry. Yes. What did he study? Political Science. He's been delivering pizza for three years. ONE WEEK LATER... Their system's well thought-out, very clever. What a shame. If only their intelligence weren't wasted. There's great potential here. Good luck with that! They've caught the virus for easy money, just like you, but in another sector. It's not well soundproofed. If that were the only issue... Rose grew up in a place like this. Do you miss her? Yes. It's not great, she wants to divorce. -Are you married? -No! He gave me two kids, then disappeared. Poof! Never to be seen again. A real stubborn idiot. Make yourself useful, help me peel them. Your wife might have started this election battle to stay close to you, and she doesn't want to split up. -You think so? -Maybe. Maybe! Nice, laugh it up! What's up with him? It'll pass. I gave your son detention. Paul? I don't mean Mr. Big-Head Léon. What did he do? He was in a fight. That's unlike him. He must have had a good reason. A classmate called him "Bakchich." -Shouldn't that moron get detention? -And so he did. Your kid's not doing very well. It's kind of normal. Any news from Félix? Why would I have news? He's disappeared from the radar, won't come to City Hall, his Chief of Staff quit. What's going on? I don't know. You know, Rose, you can talk to me. I could help you. Did you two come to an agreement, then? He disappears, you take over, he manages from behind-the-scenes? What you're saying is so chauvinistic. You think I'm incapable of running alone, like a big girl? We could work together, merge our electoral rolls. I could... I could teach you! "Teach" me? I don't get it. Are you threatening me or flirting with me? I just feel sorry for you, that's all. Take care of your kids, they're not doing well. Leave my kids alone, they're just fine. I can't believe this. "Work, family, country, law, suppression, morality, "kick foreigners out," and you want us to work together? All this to be Mayor? I'm just trying to help you! You think you can read minds? No, I can read men! And they're everywhere! Males dominating! Hello, you've reached Félix De Ponte's voicemail inbox. For professional matters, please contact the Mayor's Office. Otherwise, leave me a message after the beep. Félix? It's Rose. Could you please call me back? I've had no news from you, I'm getting worried. Thank you. Hello, you've reached Félix De Ponte's voicemail inbox. For professional matters, please contact the Mayor's Office. Otherwise, leave me a message after the beep. Are you going to call me back one day, damn it? You bastard! We have three kids! Fucking hell! No one's heard from you! Félix, you pain in the ass! Call me! -He disappeared overnight. -Didn't he say anything to you? He just sent me an email thanking me for my loyalty and asked me to handle any ongoing issues with the deputies. I thought you quit. I'm leaving at the end of the week. Would you like to join my campaign team? I'm not sure what I want to do, but I'll think about it. Thank you for the offer. We should report him missing. Last I saw him, he was depressed. He looked awful. Rose! What are you doing here? Did you know about Félix? Did you know he'd run off? No. I haven't talked to him since his indictment. Yeah, right, Charles! I'm sure you're lying. Maybe you helped him run away. Maybe you were even the first to know he'd cheated on me. Listen, Rose... I'm sorry for what's happening to you, really I am. Come on, we've all had some nice times together. I don't know where Félix is. You know him, he closes himself off. If he's really left, I'll help you. Ask me whatever you want. -How much can you give me? -For your campaign? Yes. I don't know. Tell me what you need. Shit, I can't believe you! Félix just took a fall and you'd do it again! It's not me, it's the system, Rose! You have every chance of winning, and I can help. Philippe, I will pay back everything you gave Félix, every cent! If you want, but I paid for a lot, not just campaigns and holidays. Don't be mad at him. His father left him in deep shit, full of debt. He wanted to give you a good life, that was his obsession. So, it's my fault, then? You know what? Get lost! We don't want your schemes anymore. Go on, and good riddance! Asshole! This mafé stew is to die for! Thank you, Félix. I haven't made this in a while. Some more? Gladly! Gabin, you want some more? No, thanks. I'm fine. I prefer your bourguignon. What's after dessert? Will you show him around the village? What's gotten into you? It's him! He's on a safari. He's glad to put you in your place with your local food. Don't say that! I'm proud of my origins. I don't mean that. It's that face of his! I borrowed a car, so I'll get you out of here in the trunk. What's the rush? I haven't tried the bourguignon. You've been squatting for a week! Enough already! You like exotic experiences? Then, try a homeless shelter! Well, I don't mind having him here. He can stay. We can't keep the mayor here for ten years! This isn't how I raised you. Be a good host. Wait a minute. It's fine, I wanted to talk to you about this. I want to relaunch my campaign here. I'll make an electoral roll with only people from this area. Adama, would you accept to work for the city council? If this is a joke, it's not funny. Do I look like I'm joking? And you'll oversee my campaign. -So, we're friends now? -You studied politics! Roll up your sleeves, show me what you're made of. -"Roll up your sleeves..." -Gabin! He's acting like a savior, offering me a placement! It's not a placement, it's a job! -A job? -Yes, a job. -Jobs are paid. -Yes, it's paid. -Paid? -Yes. No way, he's toast. No one would vote for you. You said De Ponte was a great brand. I just said that to get a tip. With your rotten agenda and money issues, it's dead in the water. No one's ever dead in politics until you're in the cemetery. He's right. It'll take hard work to get people to trust you here. I know. Here's your cash. Get out, now. You didn't spend it? No, I didn't. I'm not a thief. And I'm not in the mafia. Can you explain what this is? Yeah. Fine... I'm renovating an orphanage in Vietnam. Where we adopted our daughter Elsa. I'm giving this money to the boss of Royal Saigon. It's compensation. He'll send it to my contact there. That's a bunch of lies so he can hide having foreign accounts. You don't have to believe me. If this is baloney, I'm the one who will throw you out. Trust me, it's the truth. I'll relaunch my campaign here, starting from scratch, with you. IN POLITICS, NO ONE'S EVER FINISHED. JUST LOOK AT ME. ...querida presencia Comandante Che Guevara Mom? Are you OK? You're not in bed? Come on, you have to see this. OK... We've located Dad's phone. Whoopsie! Bucharest? What's he doing in... Romania? Are you sure that's his phone? Yes, 1,000%. Where have you been? Where have you been? I spent the evening with... a friend. She's hammered! No! I'm not. Just by 40, 50%... Anyway... This isn't funny, Mom. He's left, just like Grandpa did. Stop overreacting, Paul! Maybe he just needed a bit of fresh air! Let's talk about it tomorrow. It's late, go to bed. Lights off, OK? Come on, hop to it! Bucharest... What a hijo de puta! I love her. You're not looking good. Didn't sleep well? I didn't sleep a wink. OK, she's ready! Want some Dramamine? It's my head that hurts, not my stomach. Give us two minutes! -Three. -Three! According to the information I've been provided, my ex-husband has fled to Romania. We've located his phone in Bucharest. I'm devastated. I'm thinking about my kids who won't see their father again. I now realize how little I knew the man I spent so many years with. What in the world? It seems they sold your phone to a Romanian. That's terrible! I look like a coward now! I have to warn my kids! Absolutely not! We'll let the media have fun with this. No, I can't do that to them. Calm down, breathe. This is good for us! Everyone will talk about you. In the meantime we prepare our response. When you show up, your wife will look like a big liar. Stop wolfing down my mom's cakes! I make you do exercise for nothing! Who's "Stalin"? Shit! Give me that. It's Skype. -You're using my tablet to Skype? -Hang up! No! Yes, Dad? Finally, you pick up! I thought you killed yourself! Suicide is only good for leftists! I am a leftist, Dad. I just want to say: stop hiding, get back in the arena. Lead an aggressive press campaign. Alright? Lawsuits, denial, right of reply, and all that jazz. When your back's against the wall, you're caught red-handed, always deny! Got it? Where are you? Don't worry about that. Worry about handling your wife! She has to withdraw her candidacy. I'm sure she's getting advice from that idiotic father of hers. Communists leading Châteauneuf, is that what you want? Rose isn't a Communist! Sure, "Rose isn't a Communist." Come on, get a grip! Bite back, scratch and attack! Reveal her little secrets, throw her off balance! Got it? Who... who is that behind you? My Campaign Manager and his mother. Seriously? Did they just cross the Mediterranean? You're helping asylum seekers? You're so naïve! Do what I say or we'll lose Châteauneuf. -You're still in touch with him? -You picked up! If they hear about this, you're dead! Are you with him? Does it look like I'm with him? Honestly! Who else knows? Does your wife know about this? No! I'm not in touch with him, you're the one who picked up! -You know where he is. -No! This isn't good. Stop talking to Stalin. You picked up! Next time, don't pick up. Damn it! I've had enough of this. Where are you going? A BOSS IS MADE FOR BOSSING. Can you tell me your plan? Or are you getting killed for free? Take the enemy by surprise. Record this, don't miss a thing. Right, "don't miss a thing"... -That belongs to me. -You don't get it, I'm the boss here. -It's not your mother's. -No, my grandfather's. Fuck your grandfather. So... I know that many of you don't like me, and understandably so. But I want to tell you that I'm with you. I'm with you. The Maximilien De Ponte neighborhood shouldn't be a lawless area but an area with laws that work for you! I intend to respect that. As my son, Léon, says, "I don't want to be part of the problem, "but part of the solution." We're going to build that neighborhood together! He mentioned me! He knew that one day we'd find his GPS location. And now, you look like an idiot! And he's a saint, taking refuge in a dodgy neighborhood. Eloi, do you also think Félix has manipulated me? It's possible. If so, that's well played. Or he just had his phone stolen. What's he still defending his father for? Rose, you have to respond and quickly. There's work to do. Yes? Rose, it's not what you think! Rose! No! Excuse me. Rose, I can explain! Let me explain! This isn't our home anymore. Stop it! Rose! How many do you have? -How many what? -Women! No! I'm staying with Gabin and his mother. Right! You think I'm an idiot! What are you thinking? I swear, on our kids... Don't you dare swear on our kids! Swear on Gabin instead! That's absurd! What are you imagining? Rose! I'll see you in court! Wear something else. Let me explain! Don't explain or say a word! I don't want to hear you! Shit! Mr. Mayor, you want a rose without the thorns? Oh, no! Stop filming! Enough with the videos! -I've been robbed! -Mr. Mayor, I'll kick your ass! Gabin, if you do something to our phones, you're dead! -Don't touch our phones! -Let him finish! Finish what? Why did you take our phones? What about my keys, wallet, and car? We told you, it wasn't us! You think I'm an idiot? You emptied my pockets that night. -We told, that wasn't us! -Sure! You're Dimitri's minions. -Minions? -That's enough! Gabin! Get out of my house! -You have no business here. -They stole it, ma'am, we swear! I'll teach you some respect, you uneducated idiots! Get out! I'll talk to your mothers, you'll see! Your mother is much more efficient! It was tough, but I managed to delete everything. You were almost on Instagram. Your wife thought we were together, right? Yes. She thinks Gabin is my son. That's absurd. I'm sorry. I'll go see her and explain. That's very nice of you, Adama, but there's no point. She's jealous. That's good news, isn't it? Hey! Your phones! Send my best to Dimitri. Fuck your mother! What? I didn't show any disrespect. You can't do that. I'll get dressed. I have to go door-to-door and start making a roll. Have you read Est Éclair? He didn't just put Adama in his bed, but in an electable position. And her son has replaced you, Éloi. Really? -Is that her? -Yes, that's her. -We can leak this! -No! I forbid you! We can't use the enemy's methods. We must keep our hands clean. I don't want the kids to find out. You don't win an election by keeping your hands clean. They say, "Too electable to be honest." I should never have to told you, you won't be able to keep it secret. Rose, your kids will find out. It will leak, it's inevitable. I don't want to talk about this with you now. I have to focus on my speech. How about we do a rehearsal? Just to get into the zone. -Right now? -Yes! Good idea. So... First of all, thank you. Thank you for being here. Thank you for accepting to be on my electoral roll. Together, we will change how we do politics, change our practices, change this city's soul. Our platform is summed up with a single word: transparency. Degrowth. We've had some problems with youth growing up! The degrowth we're talking about involves a return to humanity. Autonomy, mutual help, fixing what should be fixed... Yes, it can be a synonym for abundance, happiness... But for that, we must roll up our sleeves, together. Two American academics developed a theory: the Broken Windows Theory. If there's a broken window somewhere and we don't fix it right away, we gradually see the dilapidation of the whole neighborhood. The more deteriorated a place is, the more insecure people will feel. We've felt abandoned by public authorities for a while, so frustration and anger have given some the right to break things, to destroy the shared space, since no one cares about it anymore. The problem is that atmosphere serves people like Dimitri and his crew we know so well. To keep their trafficking going, they'd prefer for our neighborhood to be in ruins. That allows them to establish an atmosphere of fear, giving up, for us to submit. That has to stop. The State has the duty to support us in this goal. We should claim our right to... have a broken elevator be fixed immediately, have a burnt car be cleared away as soon as possible, have a graffitied wall be repainted that same day. But to do that, we need everyone's input, for us to be respected, we should respect each other. It'll be a daily fight, I'm counting on you to keep it up. To illustrate what Gabin has just said, look at this: by changing two letters, in "dealers" and "leaders", you change a person's destiny. Let's act together for Maximilien De Ponte! End of the line! Everybody off! What are you doing? Are you insane? I'm not going in there! It's Beirut. I said no! But you're paid to go there. I'm not paid to get assaulted! So long, ladies and gentlemen... I'll drive. No! Does anyone have a bus license? -I do! -Great. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Seriously? How lucky is that? Wonderful! We're back on the road! Three cheers for Alexandra! Hip, hip! Hurray! DE PONTE ESTATE Well done! Bravo! We've been waiting for ten years! -Go on! -Off we go! That feels good. -Ready for the Kardashians? -I could have done without this. I'll go first. As you wish. I know you're busy with your new life but remember you have other kids too. Rose, what are you imagining? That Adama is my mistress? That Gabin is my son? That he delivers pizza to come visit me? That's insane. I'm the one who's insane? Fine, good luck with your new life. -Mrs. De Ponte! -Over here, please! Félix, I don't get it. Why did you let her have it all? If you'd listened to me, we'd have crushed her. This way is fine. I've never felt so light. We're just doing our job! Please step aside. No, please step back. FOR SALE -How are you? -Hola! How are you, Dad? -You alright? -Yes. -I'm so glad to see you. -Me too. You OK? Doesn't seem like it. -No, I've got the blues. -Yeah. Seeing the house for sale gave me a shock. Come in, take a seat. -It's pretty nice in here. -Welcome. It's really starting to take shape. This is exotic wood, isn't it? Your carbon footprint will take a hit! I don't care! I didn't buy it, it's recycled. I'm not responsible. Careful, that's how it starts. Then, it's a downward spiral. -I'd know. -Yeah. What you're doing is good. You siphoned off all my ideas, but it's good. You've been going on about degrowth for two years, it finally stuck. That's funny. I always thought you didn't care about my ideas. I saved a spot for you on my roll. An eligible position. "Eligible?" You're making fun of me. You're kidding, right, Dad? -I know you've got it in you. -But... -You have to start early. -No. Don't you think it's time we work together, prepare the future? Don't joke around, I don't do politics. -Yeah, right! What's all this, then? -It's... Good. Let me try this. It's in your blood, I know it is. This stuff is strong! I've brought my son. PROSPEROUS DEGROWTH I put it up, press it on the wall, then spread the glue. Why are you here? It's my turn. -The principal wants to see us. -Why? What happened? -Wow, they got you good! -Yeah. Do you realize Elsa sees this every morning? It's not an insult. It says "SOB"! It means "son of a bitch"! Go on, let it out! What about your poster? If they graffiti yours... "QOS", what would that mean? "Queen of..." -Queen of Suckers! -Right... Why did you drag Léon into this mess? Because of you, he's dropped his studies. He'd dropped them a long time ago. He's smart, you know? He's a real leader, he'll go far. I won't fall for your tricks, Félix. When I lied, you believed me. I don't lie, you don't believe me. I've lied to you too. Do you know why our kids are called Léon, Paul, and Elsa? Léon, the title of a movie I love, Paul for Paul McCartney, and Elsa... Wrong. Léon is for Trotsky, Paul is for Éluard, and Elsa is for Triolet. Three Communists. Shall we? You didn't! Since your divorce, your daughter's behavior has changed a lot. Things have been complicated. But everything's under control. We talk and get along well. -Right, honey? -Yes, very well. What do you mean, "changed a lot"? She behaves like you: she's campaigning. They do meetings, sit-ins, protests during recess... Half of her classmates are now vegans. The parents are complaining. The other day, Geoffrey Muller went home, took all the computers in his house and the family's phones and threw them in the trash. Your daughter is a bad influence on her classmates. Well, I wouldn't call it a "bad influence"! She wants to raise their awareness, prepare them for the future. I spent a few weeks without my phone and it went really well. Yes, that's true. He shipped his phone to Romania! -No. -Really? -It was stolen. -Right. -It was stolen. -Right. Mrs. Chanteux, I think Elsa is a born leader. She's a De Ponte. And a Moreno, like her mother and grandfather. Moreno? A Moreno! Sorry! What have the Morenos done? Nothing! Meanwhile, the De Pontes built this city! Yes! There are lots of De Pontes in this city because they make lots of bastards everywhere you look! All over this city! The De Pontes are victims of their own reptilian brains! OK... Gabin is not my son! Gabin is not my son! How can I make this any clearer? -In what language? Javanese? -Why not Senegalese? Senegalese isn't a language. They speak Wolof, Soninke, and French. They don't speak Senegalese. Wow, you're well-informed! How about Romanian? Do you have another family there? -You want every City Hall in Europe? -Stop it! Honey! We've had a nice chat with your teacher. You should really try to relax. At recess, run around, play hopscotch... Or play soccer, that's good too. But no more dragging your classmates into protests. Just a bit but not too much. And eat plenty of meat, it'll help you grow healthy. But Léon said we should eat less meat so fewer cows will ruin the ozone layer by farting! Here's what we'll do about the cows: we put a cork in their butts, problem solved! Mrs. Chanteux? I dreamt that you'd get remarried. Honey, we just got divorced. I know... Do you want to come over for dinner? Sure. I'll tell Léon to join us. -Water, honey? -Yes, please. Mom, Gabin and I have decided to make green roofs and build a household appliance repair shop for the neighborhood! We have so many ideas, this is just the beginning! It'll be great! I'm glad you're no longer waiting for the end of the world in your cabin. I'm going to bed. Good night, honey. Yes! Good night, sis. Good night, dear. Will we move to that neighborhood soon? What does that mean? We were never going to actually move there. It's social housing, we can't take up another family's space. We do, 100%! We're selling the house, the furniture, all of it! Your mom wants that, not me. You have your new family. What do you mean? Well done! You share info with the tabloids now? Only you would spread that! -It wasn't me. I didn't say anything. -Wait, it's true? It's not true! Enough, already! Gabin is not my son. There's nothing between Adama and me. Got it? They're hosting me while I look for a place. -Tell them it's fake. -Why did you do that? It sucks! I told you it wasn't me, damn it! Your grand principles didn't last long! You're not well placed to lecture me! If that's how you take it, just give up now, you'll end up worse than me! Stop, this is unbearable! Can't you think about us? Your father didn't when he'd collect his money. You never ever tried to look into my problems! Never! I trusted you! I thought I could count on you. I was patient, even when you'd no longer look at me. -I wouldn't look at you? -No. You must be joking! It was you! -I didn't look elsewhere! -Stop! We're tired of all your bullshit! Léon, please don't get reeled in by your father. Once the election is over, he'll get back to his habits. That means you think you have no chance of winning! Meaning, I'll be elected. So, give up! I can't stand this! You two just can't agree? Dad, step aside for Mom's sake. Mom should! Dad and I are doing historic work for Châteauneuf. Stop fighting! Are you happy now? Are you thinking of your kids? Your family? -You bastard! -Hey, are you crazy? Stop it. -Mom, stop! -Are you nuts? Stop! You're both completely mad! Rose De Ponte, the innocent lamb discovering the reality of politics and claiming she knew nothing of her husband's extravagant lifestyle. Meanwhile, he wants us to believe that he's changed. How magnificent. Allow me to share with you -his platform's key points... -Yeah, sure! Go ahead. You have no platform, Mr. Molmant-Martinez, so you spend your time commenting other people's. Yes, the same old story. So, may I continue? -Go right ahead! -Thank you. So... He wants to grow fruits and vegetables in shared green spaces to reach self-sufficiency. Soon, we can make a stop at the crossroads to pick some potatoes. He wants the kolkhoz! You're a man of the past! -That's why you don't get it. -Sure, you're all for green spaces. Don't forget to add signs on your new crossroads, we no longer know if you're on the left or right! I don't care about your labels! They're meaningless now because until now, the right has never been right and the left is always left-field! Yes. You won't get out of this with witty remarks, Mr. De Ponte. I'd like to establish a new unit of measure for our citizens, the GIH: Gross Internal Happiness. "Gross Internal Happiness," what nonsense! -I embody change! -You're talking nonsense, Félix. You represent the past, I embody change, -political renewal! -You embody nothing. Please! -Gentlemen, please! -You're responsible! We can't hear a thing! Mrs. De Ponte, you're behind in your speaking time. With good reason: I'm assisting a pathetic cockfight. Again, he has no platform, so he employs misogyny by calling me an innocent lamb. No, you're twisting my words, Mrs. De Ponte. You called me an innocent lamb, Mr. Molmont. Félix De Ponte is redeeming himself in a neighborhood bearing his ancestor's name. An opportunistic approach, that certainly resembles him. I know him well, so I confirm he cannot embody change. It's clear: the family atavism is much too strong for him to avoid diving back into his lies. Félix De Ponte comes from a family that always has its hands in the cookie jar. For once, we can agree, Mrs. De Ponte. That's great news, Mr. Molmont. I don't have the ambitions of a man. I don't aim for the position as Mayor to seduce or get rich. No, I don't want power. I want the power to act. I want the power to change our citizens' lives in a serene, peaceful environment. Mr. De Ponte, I have several messages online regarding your second family. Yes, those rumors... Which you've gladly spread, like everything you print about me. We print nothing without proof. Corruption was proven. Alright, fine. I have a DNA test here, certified by a court bailiff, proving Gabin Diop is not my son. However, what is true is that Gabin, Adama, and the estate residents have become very close to me. My platform is not mine, it's mostly theirs. It belongs to Gabin and my son, Léon. Yes, I'm troublesome. Today, giving power to citizens, people of every social class, to women, people under 30, doesn't fit the logic of political parties and the media. Bravo! What the hell is this "self-sufficiency"? You're kidding, right? Don't tell me you believe that bullshit! You want anarchy? You better leave with your savings before it gets bad. I don't have any savings. What? I hope you're joking! What did I tell you? What are the basics? When you break the rules, prepare an exit strategy. You're pissing me off! If I break the rules, it's to fix your bullshit and help others. "Help others?" What the hell's wrong with you? You must get it from your mother! Leave Mom in peace. If Rose wins, take off. She'll crucify you once in power. You'll go to jail. With Communists, it's all limited jurisdiction. Nonsense! This is total madness! What's wrong? Why did you walk away? Shit, my car! Bakchich, this is our town! Damn bastard! SOB They're your initials, after all. YOUR MOTHER'S A WHORE-TICULTURIST! I can't believe this! They destroyed everything. Nothing left. I shouldn't have dragged you into this. I wanted to believe. And I really did. I'm sorry. I truly am. Next, they'll go after you, they're crazy. Go home. Hey, Bakchich! Now's not the time to give up! We have to keep going! Either way, with or without you, -we can do it. -Yeah! They can break things, we'll just rebuild. They can break it again, we'll re-rebuild! If they break it again, again, we'll re-re-rebuild! This is our home, not Dimitri's! -They can't push us around! -Just like those American windows! Is this our home, or isn't it? Back to work! This is our home! SINCE A POLITICAL MAN NEVER BELIEVES IN WHAT HE SAYS, HE'S SURPRISED WHEN OTHERS BELIEVE HIM. Hello. -Hello. -Thank you. A few points from our platform. Thank you. Sorry for bothering you. Thank you. I see you have one. Bon appétit! Thank you. -Mr. Mayor, some shrimp? -Gladly, but later. Later, then. Hello. How are you? -Fine. -Mr. De Ponte. Mrs. Bertrand, will you vote for me? We'll see. Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you. I'll be honest, I don't know what to think of you. Really? I'm shocked by how much you've changed in the past months. You're not here to congratulate me. I'm here to warn you about my next article. Another one? Don't you know anyone else around here? A few years ago, you committed tax evasion through an association meant to build an orphanage in Vietnam. No, I financed that through my own savings. It was perfectly legal at first. It's the orphanage where we adopted Elsa. But they tricked me. The construction work never happened and the head of the humanitarian organization ran off with the money. But I didn't let it go. A large part of the kickbacks I'd won for Châteauneuf procurement was used for that construction work. It's illegal, but it's the only way. To get the construction work moving, I sent a big bakchich to a local sponsor. I was the only one who could support them. I know it's reprehensible, and I deserve to be punished. I should have accepted my flaws. I should have accepted my fate. I'm sure Rose and the kids would have accepted too. I had no choice. I'd promised Elsa I'd get the orphanage rebuilt. -Dad! -Darling! She was three years old when we met. We should always keep our promises, especially the ones we make to children. When my wife and I decided to go for adoption, we never expected it would bring us so much joy. It's time I deal with the consequences of my actions. Good luck. Mr. De Ponte. FELIX DE PONTE TELLS US EVERYTHING Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to protect you. -Hello, Mr. Mayor. -Hello. How are you? I have something important to tell you. Hello. How are you? Hi, Salem. You alright? How are you? Want to come in? Hello! -How are you? -Fine. How are you? I have big news. I'm stepping down. No! Allow me to introduce our new head: Rose De Ponte. -No! Why? -Yes, why? We want to keep going. And we will! I promise, all together, nothing changes. We'll win together. We're merging our electoral rolls. No one will be left out, and I'm not leaving. I just have one thing to say. I want to thank you because thanks to you, I've found my love for politics again. And I got the love of my life back. And we got our vegetable garden back, our neighborhood back, and our dignity back. Thanks, Félix. Thank you. De Ponte! De Ponte! De Ponte! Hi! You were the mole. You're the one who told Inès Bertrand about the orphanage. Well, that sure took a while! The photos with Jocasta, foreign accounts, etc. It was for your own good. You're not made for politics: too naïve, soft, and idealistic. You didn't learn any of my lessons! It was time I ended your political career. What do you want, then? For Molmont-Martinez to win? Why not? He's alright. Never forget that it's because you're my son and have my name that people still vote for you! If only that hysterical Rose didn't mess it all up... Hello, Jean-Charles! How are you? What the hell is she... What the hell is this? I thought you were divorced! I have big news for you. Félix is retiring, we're merging our rolls. What! You Communist! -I have something to tell you. -Oh no! What? Spit it out, this is unbearable! I love you. Will you remarry me? Dream on! Friends, we're witnessing a historic moment: the end of the De Ponte era. We can't let that jerk screw us over! We don't have half the results in yet. If Molmont-Martinez wins, we'll be here to fight. The old left-wing still has a good right hook! I can't stand this! Who's the pretty girl talking to Léon? That's Julie, Gabin's sister. She came from London just to vote. You should warn him he's flirting with his half-sister! Sorry to interrupt but the Valone results came in. Looks good! -Really? -It's a close call, but possible. Come on! Come on! This is intense! I'm sure she'll win. I just know it. Thank you, Adama. -We can do it. -Yes. Come on, just a bit longer. What the hell did you do? You were way ahead! Yes, but nothing happened like we'd planned. Where are you? Don't worry about that, I'm coming home. Come pick me up on Friday at Le Havre. If Romeo and Juliet want war, then they'll get it! OK, see you Friday, Dad. ELECTED Thank you so much for the trust you've given me. I'm really touched, I'm perfectly aware of the responsibility I've been given. But I know I have the best counsellor by my side. Thanks to you, dear, I know exactly what not to do in politics. Here. De Ponte! De Ponte! De Ponte! IN LIFE, THERE ARE HIGHS AND LOWS. WE MUST OVERCOME THE HIGHS AND FIX THE LOWS.
