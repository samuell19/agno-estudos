Fai Chuen, do you know what my dad asked me? When will you get married? He asked whether I am still a virgin or not. He is so silly! He means it. How about your ass? How dare you say such thing! You mean it? Yes, so what? Come on. Look at the woman behind, her boobs... So big! Where is my ham? You only have to watch! No food is necessary. Out the crap, I can't handle her alone.

I prefer watching. Kid, your monthly payment. Don't move! Freeze! Hurry up! Get in. Wait for me. Fat Lion, hurry up! Cut the crap, have a smoke first. Move! Are you nuts? No problem! Fai Chuen, we've agreed to teach him a lesson only. But now you killed him! Don't you think I mean it? He was as tough as a stone! I should have brought the knife from my kitchen. Just take him as pork and chop! When you talk, it works. When you work, you are jerk. Can you turn the radio off? Yes, sir. Chuen, I told you not to do it hard. Let me see! I have bandage here. Get lost. Stop playing. Why didn't take care of me! See, my foot is stained with blood. I should have blamed you! Chuen, Brother Piu promised a promotion after this mission. Is that true? Lau. Sit properly, don't down your head. Be good, up your head, right. Auntie Mom. Get a proper job! You always have temp job. Well, why not apply to be a fireman as your dad did? Nonsense. Kid, say something for me please. Give it to me. Brother Chuen... There is something wrong with Fatty. What is the matter? He was caught stealing in the supermarket. Kidding? It's true! Let's go and take a look. How is my head? I'll fix it when I come back. Jose, Fatty's in trouble. Don't bother my homework. Homework? Run now. Asshole! I told you not to steal! Stop beating me... Why did you stop me? None of your business! Auntie, you can't teach him in this way. Let us take him to the station. Sir, don't arrest my son! I will teach him. What's the matter? Get lose! He stole! Steal? What did you steal? I stole a pack of cigarette. Just a pack of cigarette! You needn't pick him to the police station. He has been seriously beaten. Are you the judge? Should I listen to you and set him free? Are you scaring me? Who are you? Who are you? Are you kidding? Don't you know me? He is my boss. So what? Sir. Give way... It's just a misunderstanding. Misunderstanding? Did you pay? It's just misunderstanding. He paid. Really? Are you threatened? Are you? No. Goodbye sir. Fai Chuen. Chun, why haven't you come home early? Where did you go? No. Don't mess up I just played with Brother Chuen. Dad, let me help you. If you want to join the triad, I can introduce to you. Don't take risk! I don't know what you are talking about. Youngsters always some matter with firsts. If you are lucky, you will be put in jail. If not, you will be buried under soil. Brother Chuen is great. I don't mean Chuen, he is really smart. Of course. Iced lemon tea for table 12. Chun, study hard for my sake please. Years of hard studies exchange for decades of comfortable living. You will know my words are right. Check. Yes. Dad, check please. Check. Which bastard is fooling me? Boss... Oh, it's you! Boss, are you doing voluntary work here? We come to cover them. Leave such work to the drug addicts. You know, I know so many friends around. I just give them a hand. Boss, when will you have time to clean my house? How dare you take my daughter's advantage in front of me? We are in love. I prove that they have slept together. Boss, we want to listen to your story. Oh, you want to hear my heroic stories. Yes. Which story do you want to hear? Boss, It's sunny here! It's not wise to stand here. Dad, let's go to a place with air-conditioning. Yeah... Wait, who will pay for it? Anyone will do. Brother Chun, your ice coffee. Brother Chun, your iced tea. Thank you. Take it yourself. I'll help myself! Chun, come here... I have got an English letter, read it for me. Alright Chun is great! He's studied a lot! He is good at English. If you know English, you don't have to follow him. You can be an inspector. You know nothing! It someone knows English. At least, it'll be easier for him to cheat tourist's money! You fat-headed! Better keep your mouth shut. Boss, why do you get mad? Come on, tell us your heroic history. Come on! Boss, don't get angry. At that time, every triad societies want to get a share in Wanchai. Boss, what do you mean by at that time? Which year? More than a decade ago! I killed at least three times a day. No one dared to fight with him! Don't you think it's movie? You know nothing! All of my friends and buddies learnt Kung-fu at that time. Boss, you just talk. No visuals at all. You are so anxious! Visual now! Brother Piu was leading two hundred fellows. When they entered Wanchai... starting by a sword! How about you? I am good at fighting of course! It's so exciting! He means good at playing mahjong. Boss, forget the gossip I trust you! Just go ahead telling your story. Go on. I was great! I held the knife in hand and chopped their legs and hands off. There were too many bamboo basket! Ended by another sword. Then, Hung Lok Society has established a base in Wanchai. Who dares to enter their society would... Higher your feet. Where are those bastards? Dad, stop pretending! You did see them leaving one after another, why do you still ask? It's your fault! You always lease your dad. That's why those bastards copy you! They are just copying you! Check please. Have you dated Chuen? He isn't my only boyfriend. Be frank. Are you still virgin? Listen to me. Virginity is the most precious thing of a woman, don't lose it easily. Are there any more virgins in this world? I am leaving. Wear condom! You just don't want to listen to me! Brother Shui, your girl is filial indeed! It's hard to teach a kid nowadays. It's better having a son than a daughter. If you have a son, he can cheat others. If you have a daughter, she will be cheated. You are silly! It's hard for a man to earn a living. For women, they can earn a living by hooking. It's more easy to make a living. You have rich experience in teaching daughters, haven't you? Well, let's exchange our children. Stop kidding! Let me treat you the tea. No, you are making a living by this. Chun, check it. I will be the banker. Stop it. Come on! 123, watch my order. You are so bad! You always lose. Let me do it. Miss, what do you want to listen to? Let me help you. Well, I want to hear... This, this, this, that, that, and that. How can you hear so many songs at the same time? That's right! You nuts! Do you want to court me? My boyfriend is over there. Sorry. You love admitting your fault but you never regret. Does someone court you because of your look? This outlook is all the good. That's why others love courting me. Do you want someone to court you? May I court you? Alright. Let's dance. What? Stop playing! What? That girl is great. Where is she? The one sitting over there! She has nice figure. Right. Isn't she great? You have women to sleep with every night. While I am always sleeping alone. Better leave her to me. That's dangerous! Let me see. Let's wait and see. Hi, Jenny, are you drinking alone? Let me keep you company! Fatty, long time no see. So passionate! It's funny! Big tits! Why not enjoy ourselves in the motel tonight! Fatty, how dare you court my girl? Who is your girl? She is my girl. Damn it! You have belly and you claim her your girl? What? Whose belly is bigger? Pal, let's have a talk. What do you want? How dare you court my girl? What's the matter? I thought she was lonely, I didn't know she is your girl? What did you say? Who are you? We are the boys of Hung Lok Society. Hung Lok? Alright! Let's talk out there. Let's go out. Pal, what's up? Do you want to be that serious? Not serious? He is courting my girl. Let's exchange for it. Let me court your girl? Do you know who my dad is? Who is your father? My dad is Fu Shui! Fu Shui? I don't know nothing about Fu Shui! Go to hell! I wanna kill you! Bastard! Beat him! Go to hell! Still wanna go? What's happened? Go to hell! Bastard! Stop! All of you stop! Boss. Ox. Stop fighting! Stop! They come to mess up. You can say anything you want in your place. My boss is present how dare you bull shit right here? Go to hell! Stop! Stop moving. Clean your blood. How dare you counter attack? What? Stop... Stop fighting! If you have guts, just kill me or I'll take revenge. Revenge? Stop fighting. Stop. Don't you think I dare not kill you? Bastard! Don't you worry you would be killed? I am a rascal. I won't lose the face of my society. It's the luck of your society to have a member like you. Which society are you in? Hung Lok of Aberdeen, my boss is Fu Shui. Clean the place for me. Yes. Follow me. Go. Hands off Don't touch me. Do you want a beat up? Tell me honestly, before fighting did he announce anything? No, boss, he didn't say anything! It's true. Ox. Boss. You are a button. Yes. Once you are pressed, you will move. Yes. You are impulsive too. Yes. You won't cheat your boss. No! You won't lie to your boss. No. Tell me frankly, did they announce their names? Yes. My buddy was beaten, I must give him a hand. Alright. Come here. Boss I always teach you, those who join Hung Lok are all buddies of you. Fight with the outsiders together. But co-operate with your fellows. How many times should I repeat? No more, boss, I've heard many times. What? I remember. Bastard! No... I dare not do it next time. How did he beat you? Just beat him the same way he did to you. Forget it, we are a family anyway. You are something! Do you know who I am? I don't know. I am your head! Call me Brother Piu. Are you Brother Piu? Don't you know it? Blackie Tak is my fellow. He did something wrong this day, I should be responsible. So, I have to punish him. Take me twenty thousand. Yes. Boss. Take it for medical treatment. No, Brother Piu. Why not? I won't take it back. Thank you, Brother Piu. What's the name of your boss? Fu Shui in Aberdeen, his name is outstanding. Yes. Fu Shui? Have you any idea? No matter what, tell your boss to have tea with me. Brother Piu, did you ever see our boss? It's not strange, Piu has so many fellows. Silly boy. I think, boss isn't called Fu Shui. He is called Bull Shit! Are you alright? I am fine. I am not fine! How dare you fool me? Let's go. We will have fun when we see our boss. Brother Sunny, how are you? Fai Chuen, where is your boss Shui? Boss. Dad. Boss, the left hand of Brother Piu is coming for you, come here. Stop fooling me! I mean it! I'll close the door for you. I trust you. Let's go. See you. Boss, why so mysterious? Eat something first. Boss, what Brother Piu wants from you? He wants me to work for him of course! See this Brother Hung? He is a powerful man in Mongkok. Brother Piu wants me to fix him. Let me see his face. Take it to me. Boss, let us do this for you. Damn it! It's killing! It's a big crime! Well... I will kill that guy with Jose. Fat Lion, you watch for us. Ostrich, you will be the driver. You want me to drive? Why not you take my place and I'll take yours? I'm no match for you. Take any weapon you want. Fat Lion, you are the watcher, better take this one. You should know your post! Am I like a butcher? It's hot! Any air-conditioning? What are you doing? I worry that I would have been recognized. I have got it ready for you. If you are scared, just go home. I am not chicken! They are coming... Get off, start working. What am I going to do? Watch! Brother Hung. What do you want? Go to hell! If you movie, I would kill you too. None of your business. I wanna kill you!

Isn't it exciting? How are you? Dad, what are you watching? None of your business! How are you? Everything's fine! Give me a cigarette. Me too. Where is your lucky rope? Not on the hand. How do you feel about killing? It's exciting! Boss, we have to erase them. Sure! Hold it. Take the money for a fever tonight. Thank you, boss. We can enjoy tonight. Wait... Drop these to the sea first. It's worth hundreds of money! What a waste. Don't you think I am insane? You fat-headed. This is the last thing you do after killing. Destroy evidence! Throw it to the sea. Got you. Don't panic. Brother Chuen, I am really scared. Let's play, come on. They are fierce. Don't threaten me. Not as fierce as you. Brother Chuen, let me follow you. Damn it. I don't want your dad to poison my breakfast. Brother Bill, they are over there. Brother Chuen, they are here. Chuen, you are here! Chun, how about your red pocket? What's the matter? Don't you have money for food? Chuen, is he your fellow? No, but we have close relationship. Are you covering him? Brother Chuen, what's the matter? Do you want our buddies to come? I called a hundred to stand by. I told you not to call so many people here. It's a praise to them! Ask them to wait for me in the restaurant, find a bigger one. Bill, listen. He is still a student. If he wants to follow someone, he will come to me. Why didn't you tell me you know Chuen? Why did you scare him? I told you, anything bad happens, I will put all the blames on you. I will make you pay for it. Forget it. Let's go. It'll be fine. Thank you. Any trouble? You don't believe me, do you? None of your business even there is trouble. Go and give your dad a hand. Brother Chuen, I am leaving. Go on playing. So, where are the fellows? What a buffer! Chuen, let's go for tea. Ask your fellows to come go. I don't know them. Just football players. Kidding? I told you to gather buddies, who did you ask? Neighbours. Do you know where he is living? Don't know. Don't know? Brother Shui, police is waiting for you. Stop! Freeze! Sir. Sir, he is only a kid, he has nothing to do with it. Give him a chance. No! You go in. Chu, do you know it's illegal? You will be arrested. Please don't go with Fai Chuen. Freeze. Stop! Why running fast? What are you doing? Chuen... Come out, I have something to talk to you. What's the matter? Dad is caught. How come? I don't know! What'll I do? Don't panic, listen. I am looking for Jose now. Visit your dad in the police station. When everything is fixed, wait for me at Pearl's restaurant. Pearl's Restaurant. Hurry up. Go. Mom, I am going out. Have a bowl of soup first. Not now. It someone calls me, ask who he is. Say something, don't give me hard time. Are you dumb? Are you pretending to be dumb? How dare you kill in day time? Now, you're famous! Don't you think we are incapable? Don't you want to talk? Do you want to be solely responsible? Can you make it? Officer Kent, egg sandwich and tea. Hung is now being rescued. Hope he would be alright. Bastard, I would beat you up! Give me the book. Officer Kent. Officer Kent, someone is here for Chan Shui. Dad. Get lost! I am his daughter, I just want to see him! Are you telling me? Why don't you let me see him? Dad, how are you? Did they beat you? It yes, I would sue them. No. Hung's case is exposed, ask them to hide up. Where can they go? Go to Club Hoisa to find my buddy Magic Lamp. He will arrange it. Dad, how about you? Forget about me. I used to visit such place, it's like home coming. Don't worry. Dad. Why do you talk now?

Uncle Lamp, this is my boyfriend, Chuen. Brother Lamp. What a world! Even Shui recruits fellows! So funny! Although my boss isn't as smart as you. He is hold and righteous. Of course, or how can be qualified to be my buddy? Come and sit here. Fatty, sit over there. Maria, bring me the wine. We are going into fugitive we would like a place to hide. It's a piece of cake. Mama. What's your order! Get me some girls I'll get the best for you! Give me a kiss. Take a seat. Brother Lamp, what are the girls for? You have to eat while you are in fugitive, right? If you are put behind bars, you won't have women for years. It sounds reasonable. Well, don't waste any time! If you touch me again, it'll go up! You are smart! Of course, once you see his long hair, you can tell it. This is the key of my villa in Yuen Long. Thank you. It's well equipped! I stayed there when I was in fugitive. Now, it's the world of young man! Why do you smoke in this way? I wanna smoke but I am afraid of cancer. So, double insured. Why are you so hairy? What are you doing? Just go to sleep! Brother Lamp, did you call your place a villa? You're kidding me. Damn it! I am your friend, not your dad. It's kind of me to provide you a place to hide up! Cut the crap. What do you think? Brother Lamp, any girl provided too? I am not a provider? Just court any girl you like. The wolf is back. Where is my chair? Your girl has gone! You are shit this time! Sometimes, you need not sleep with the woman you courted. It depends on the mood. Have a drink. Cheers! Damn it! Who is it? Who should here? Brother Paul. Magic Lamp, what are you doing here? Drinking! So? Pick up my shoe. Copied. Don't you think he is a branch leader? Stop playing! No! Kid, if you have guts, wait for me. Alright! Hey, better flatter but no anger!

You lose the face of Wanchai! D & G? D & G! Eat shit! I will kill you, trust me? Here comes your shoe! Brother Paul, the kids need more education. Come on, wear your shoe! If you want to kill them, it's just a piece of cake, right? Come on, don't get angry. It's alright. Nice shoe! D&G! It's alright, get lost... Go. Want a revenge? Go. So what? What are you looking?

You look strong! But you are like a cigar! You didn't react even you are sucked. Kids, you will know how the world is going soon. For somebody they are famous because of their fists. For somebody they are famous for being beaten. Still famous! You must be the later one. I don't mind. Like Fai Chuen. He isn't a man of the world! I have seen many of his kind. Is the lighter expensive? Should be as humble as you? You acted like a dog! Didn't your buddies back you up? Call my fellows for a fighting? Don't ask me to fight! I am fine! I dress well. You are only pretending! You ruin the image of our buddies! Being a rascal, it these people don't give you face. The other type will give you face. Not everyone would give you face. Even Jesus has enemies. Don't be too serious. It will harm you only I mean it. Don't you know me? I will beat you until you know me. I can't help for you want to fight for fame. A famous guy gets enemies easily. You are lucky for no one knows you. Brother Lamp, do you have any fellows, let them help me. I have girlfriends only. Want any? You will feel ease after a sound sleep. Damn it. Hang it up. Where are you going? I am going to kill him! Better be careful! Don't leave any evidence. What a kid! How is it? Hasn't be come out? Not yet. Fai Chuen. Let's kill him tonight. Why? It'll be a good chance when he gets drunk. You are right. Fatty, why are you so clever this time? How is it? Fine. Fai Chuen, well... It's better to kill him tomorrow. Why? No rascal gets up early in the morning? That's right. If you are afraid, better go home. No more excuse. We have waited this bastard for two days. Don't waste time! We know much about you. No need of you to risk your with us. The game is not suitable for you. He is coming. Let's go. I won't force my buddies. Stay in the car. Damn you! Go to hell! Look at me! I am here for you. I am Fai Chuen of Hung Lok. You are not the only boss in the world. I am somebody too! Let's go. Read my face. Fatty. Did you have wet dream last night? Have some food. Let's go to eat. Take it out. Let's eat. Brother Lamp. You are famous in Wanchai now. We just wanted to scare him. He thought he was the boss. You should do it clean and tidy. We need not kill every time, right? This is your thought only! He doesn't think in this way. Where is the beer? Yeah, here it is. Behave yourself. It's cool enough. Apple, come and eat. No, thanks. You are late. What's the matter? Chuen, dad admits the murder. He took all the responsibility himself. What's wrong? Don't lose your mind. Shui is right. One takes the responsibility, better than dragging all to hell. Clear this place. Some people are fighting. Forget it. I am used to it. Let's go on. Squat... Don't move. Paul, what's wrong with you? Bastard, squat! If you don't want to ruin your face, on the floor now. Do you know who I am? Hands off. Are you looking for trouble? Bastard! Listen. This is caused by your new fighter, Fai Chuen. Ruin this place. Work now. Forget it, just give me face. You are all adults. What's wrong? How can you bully a kid? Even this kid ruins our reputation. When did I help you? If not were giving you face, I would have killed him. You are right. It's alright... Cut the crap! What's wrong? Is he your son? Shut up! If not for Brother Piu's sake. I would have killed you. Stop nagging, what is it? Shut up! What's wrong? It's fine... I will be the banker this time! It's alright... Cut the crap! It's fine! Let Brother Piu handle this. Here comes Brother Piu. Brother Piu. Boss. Bastard! Long time no see, why are you back? I take Fai Chuen to visit you. Brother Piu... How are you guys? Boss, you have a grand office! How's you sex life? What did you say? Just kidding! You have earned much, I guess! Do you want to come back? No, my life is free! Take a seat! I am going to chat with them. I will have a drink with you tonight. I am waiting! Come on. Remember, don't argue! Greet Brother Piu. Brother Piu. Boss, he is called Fai Chuen. I heard your name lately. Boss, he... Just save your breath. What's the matter? None of your business! Shut up! Sit down. Be smart. Brother Piu, seniors. If I did anything wrong. I wouldn't mind any punishment. In fact, I didn't do anything wrong. How dare you say so? I hurt my heard all because of you! It's your bad luck! What did you say? What? I didn't say anything! Nuts. Magic Lamp, shut up. Fai Chuen, do you know your fault? Brother Piu, I didn't do anything wrong. I joined Hung Lok, and I would never harm its reputation. If one doesn't counter attack while being beaten, one's a chicken. Hung Lok isn't an amusement center. We won't just talk but not work. You can't claim yourself a senior of us. The kids don't behave themselves! I haven't seen such ruthless people as you. Do you want a post? Of course I love to. Hung Lok will rise it only there are fair promotions & punishment. Do you agree? Kid, what bull shit did you say? What do you mean? Do you mean I am a useless leader? Shit! Go ahead. Boss, he drank much! Shut up! Get out of here. Get out! Brother Piu, you are a fair guy. But I don't know what is in your mind! The greatest fighter of us is now forty something. How long do you want him to fight for you? Time and tide wait for no man, you'd hand your power one day. Damn you! Do you want to take my post? I haven't seen a rude people as you! Do you know what's regulation? It's stipulated by people, it can be changed! Damn it! Uncle Tak, hold your temper. He drives me crazy! Sit down! Let's talk. Who taught this kid to say such impolite words? Shut up! Dear buddies, if you take me as your head. Leave this case to me. Alright! Let's wait and see I will give you a satisfactory explanation. Alright, let's see how you handle it. Regulations can't be offended, you should be punished. I don't know whether he is right or wrong. Are you satisfied? Do you want a post? Yes. You have guts! So, I'll give you a chance. If you fix Paul for Uncle Tak, I will promote you. Thank you, Brother Piu. All down, don't move! Go to hell! Stop moving! Bastard! Get lost! Run! Sunny, what is my position? Position? Why not higher? You are good at nothing, You are just extra, go away. Fai Chuen. What's up? What? We are a family. Nice to meet you. Have a smoke. Expensive smoke to exchange for friendship! Do you mean it? Are you pulling off a stunt? Sorry, I am sorry Tak, you are fooling me! So many mosquitoes here. You have tasty blood! See, the mosquitoes don't come to me. Boss... Brother Piu. Boss. You are not the kids. You can decide something to your ourselves. If you have something, which you will solve, come to me. Fai Chuen, you are their boss, take good care of them. Don't fight among yourselves, got me? Yes. If you fight against the outsides fight with all your might. To your buddies be united! Yeah. You are copying boss's words. Bravo! From now on it's the world of us! Officer Kent. Your report. Sir, Fai Chuen is promoted. Fai Chuen, get up! Something's wrong. What's the matter? Wanchai Hung said our promotions are known in the police station. Kidding? They named you the Top Ten. If you are really one of the top tens. It's sounds great. I think it's top shit! Who betrayed us? What are we going to do? Look for Brother Lamp now! Get dressed. Get up! Let's go. Brother Lamp, say something please. Come on, give us some advice. No panic! There are cops. There are undercovers of course. It's nothing astonishing. It's good! It means fame and face. Why didn't you tell us earlier? If I said so, wouldn't you get into the boat? My boss is betrayed, guess it's done by one of the members. I don't know. You are tricky! That's why you didn't get into the boat. You can't put it in that way. Since I am old. I don't want to better you and better the world. Well, I would like to throw that shoe away? Damn it! Throw your ass! You are adult! If you are free, just keep fit. Or how can you attract girls? You have to keep fit you know? Money and tame money and tame. Money or life! I will give you a new image later. Then you can wander off! Fai Chuen, let's get our base! Great! A grave and is better than nothing! Mao said, Chang's holding a knife with his left hand. And with another in his right hand. They are ready. Why don't we sharpen our knives and fight with them? Damn it! Behave yourself! Sit properly. Sit properly. Cheers! It takes you so long! Come out! Don't be shy! Come out! Sing, park the car for us please. Am I like a man? The most exciting gigolo! This is yours. Brother Lamp, is it for us? Yeah, just wear it. It's expensive! Like wasabi! Fatty, change your underpants, it's old. Bastards! I don't wear underpants without stains. You can do this when you court girls, Put your hands into your pocket, and move like this. What? You are not me. If you have tattoo. You can undress. Little friend, do you have any boss? It's good to join Hung Lok, well established and famous. We always bully kids, no... We always recruit kids. Anyways, it's good to be our fellows. You can earn money and you can court girls. Or, you can star in movies, so? You don't even have a mobile phone, how can you be a boss? Which one said a boss needs a mobile phone? Boss. What's your name? Who puts his hand on my shoulder? I am Brother 19, do you know where you are standing? Lok Hark Road. I mean what you are? Indian. Damn you! Fai Chuen! Go and help! Damn you! How dare you counter attack? Go to hell! Let's go. Are you calling for help? Ten? Hundred? Brother Tak, our men are gathered. Gathered? Just give your order. Tak, call all the fellows to wait for me in Wanchai. What? I am adult, I should have a fellow around. Alright, we have achieved something. Fighting make you grow. Boss. May I have a soft drink? Come on, take a seat first. Chuen, are you alright? I am fine! Treat his wound first. Under your feet. Brother Wanchai. Have a smoke to calm you down! It's you! No more tattoo then. Scar all over your body! I must kill that bastard! Why are you so dull? Have a smoke first, it'll calm you down. Don't you think it's medicine? It hurts! Boss, he is here. Come here. Boss. Call something to drink. Alright. Boss, a guy called Fai Chuen from Hung Lok is so cocky. He offended me. Are you alright? Fine. 19, you are no longer small potato. You can figure it out yourself. You know, money goes first in time of war. I will ask Hung to finance you. But, you can't ruin our reputation. Got you. For something you have to do it with guts. If there is anything wrong, I'll deal it with Piu. Thank you, boss. Brother Chuen. Why are you so late? I just do something for dad only. When will your exam start? Soon!

How about Chinese girl? Come to the yacht! Fai Chuen, are you going? I want go... Stay, it's men's business! I'll be back. Just forget it. Ladies, do you want lunch? Fatty, you want to eat me, right? Just remove your belly first. I can buy you if I have money! Nice tattoo. Look. It's scar, I cover it with tattoo. Are you virgin? Stop teasing me. Don't you have female classmates? It's boy's school. Well, I'll pay a hooker for you tonight. No, one will easily catch sex disease in whoring. You know my dad. You know what a condom is? It's safe.

Fai Chuen, Apple will be fine. Don't worry, it'll be fine. What are you crying, Ostrich? Find him and kill him! No crying! This is a hospital, lower your voice! Someone died. Would you cut the crap? Get lost! I just asked you to lower your voice. I asked you to get lost! Alright, shut up... No problem... How is it, Brother Chuen? Go home first, I'll call you if anything happens.

Alright, I'll go with you. Now, we were attacked. Freeze. What's up? Come! Don't panic! Be careful. I bought it, sir. Walk aside. Go. Boss. You've come. Boss, why do you look for me? I have a lot of new cars. I know you love it. There is one which fits you most! This is what I said. Like it. Take it away. Nice car but it's arrogant. Do you want to buy me? Nuts! We are buddies! Come on. There is different now! Police department is now well organized. Look, I slow cars through internet. It's like kids don't know how the wind blows. They fight to gain fame. We shouldn't argue for the kids. I will handle Fat Lion's case. I'll give him a million. As compensation. Who allowed you smoking? Damn it! If you don't want me to smoke. You stop smoking first. Great! How dare you bargain with me? This is a police station! Sir, I don't have time to keep you company. If you have enough evidence, just charge me. I am busy, I am leaving now, see you. Freeze! Get lost! You have time, you are still young. You will have chance. Are you dumb? You are nuts! How can you be a rascal? Haven't you see a dumb police? Bastard, do you want to drive me crazy? Save it, I catch thousands of your type a year. My nick name is Saliva Kent. It's a waste of time to talk to you. Just take my words as song. Just listen to him. Don't you treat me as social worker? I am a police. If you do something wrong, I'll arrest you. And put you to jail. There are over 200,000 rascals in Hong Kong. There's no space for you to be on the top. Can you claim yourself boss by swaying your weapons? Nuts! You tat headed. All rascals said they are superiors. But the greatest one was chopped into 9 pieces. The smartest one was sent to the imprisonment. The most famous one... He ran away, he dares not come back for 12 years. He is still wanted. Being a rascal? But I have to thank you. If not were you, I would have lost my job. Right, expensive ones! It's peanut, if you see me tomorrow, they will be new. Don't just think that only rascals wear expensive watches. A cop can make it too. Since you have no record, have you ever thought of being a cop? Nuts! Bastard, I am giving you chance! Don't you think that I am brainless? I don't use my brain to record your matters. But I record it with computer. Don't you think I am playing TV games here? I just draw your record from the file. Whatever you did, you do and you'll do. They are all input into the computer. We are all ready. Kid, listen to me, you can has long year. If you mess up. Either you'll be arrested, or you will be buried. Up to you. Leave now. I know you understand what I am talking about. But, you won't listen to me. Don't you think you are powerful. I don't want your friends to die with you. Consider it seriously! I think it's a waste of time. Fai Chuen, Brother Piu is waiting for you. Brother Piu, do you want me? Let's get up. Did you agree with Yee? You shouldn't care Fat Lion's case, leave it to boss. How much money will he pay? Do you know who are you talking to? I am talking to my boss. Brother Piu, you have thousands of fellows, he is nothing to you. But I have few buddies, his death worth too much to me. Fai Chuen! Chuen, boss doesn't mean to ignore this case. You can take time for the revenge, right? Brother Piu, you told me once that, I am an adult now, I can decide it for myself. Right? Yes. Leave this to me please. Brother Piu, it we let Chuen go ahead, it'll be shit. Call Pun for me. Tell him that I won't care anything. Fai Chuen, we have found 19. I'll kill Chuen sooner or later. Get me a girl. Damn you! Go to hell! Brother Chuen. Go to hell. Brother Chuen, it's my fault. I won't dare to offend you any more. Did Fat Lion beg you before his death? Did you give him a chance? Damn you! What's wrong with Seven? He hasn't shown up yet. Six, did you inform him? Of course. He must be a gambling. Let's start the conference now. Boss, have a nice day! What's wrong? Why didn't you come earlier for the conference? Fa, don't you think you are the superstar? I don't mean it! I just gambled! What a good luck I had. You know, gamblers won't admit a failure. You must have won much! A little bit. Five, I would like to tell you tips. I met many beauties in front of the casino. Let's go whoring after the meeting. Which one of you have interest in it? Yes. Let's back to the topic. Alright. Meeting starts. What are we going to discuss? Boss, you first. Back to our topic. I asked you to discuss the incident happened between Yee and us. What is it about? In the world of triads, there must be sacrifice! This is predestined, do you agree? Right, it's our choice to be rascals. Fa, can you be a bit serious? What's all the go now? Cut the crap. Shut up... can you listen to me? 3 years ago, I went to Mainland to look for union. I just want to set up new order for the triad's world. Just an announce, there won't be so many bloody cases happened. This is the aim. Right. Brother Yee, may I be excused. Fai Chuen did wrongly this time. He is right. His fellows killed, his rivals countered attack. This is fair. What's wrong? I told you, we have come to an agreement. I called you few times, but I couldn't find you. Boss, which phone are you using? Just throw it away. You are nonsense. Boss, let's talk. Let's have a good talk first. Have some tea. This is not the solution. It just wastes my time. Fa, think something. We all believe in God of Kwan. Police believe in God of Kwan too. Tell me, is God of Kwan good or bad? You are too far from the topic. Three, say something. Yes, say something. Don't waste the time of us. Decide by voting! Who thinks Chuen is wrong? Hands up. Start. Well, I have no say then. I will sacrifice this guy. From today onwards, he is no longer our man. Boss, we leave this guy to you. Thank you, it's a deal. All of you listened. Inform all the buddies. I want to kill Chuen. Come on, have a drink. Wait. He is my fellow. I don't want to bother you. I will give you a satisfactory explanation. We will wait for your good news. That's ok. Let's enjoy ourselves. Brother Piu, do you want to do it by yourself? If we hand them Fai Chuen, he will die terribly. What message do you get? Someone rings the bell. That's it. Check first! You nuts. It's Brother Ox. Shit! Brother Ox... Where's Chuen? Out there. Did you fight? Damn you! Fai Chuen, you are sacrificed by the boss, you know? I don't mind. How come? Tse Shing and Sunny are looking for him. Why is Piu the ruthless? Pack up and run! Where can I go? I asked Tak to arrange a speedboat for us to go back to China. This is caused by me. What did you say? They are just looking for me, you will be alright. How can you say such thing? We are buddies. Do you understand? I can't help! We are no match for them. Piu sacrificed me, I am no different from common people. Are we buddies? Let's go straight. If you follow me, you will die. Let's solve our problem step by step. Ox... Come on! If we are buddies, let's run. Or, just stay. You are right. It's not time for visiting! Get out please. Shut up... Fai Chuen. You can't do that. Go out. Follow me. Go. Fai Chuen! Go, I promise to wait for you. Go, go now. Freeze! Freeze! Go! Freeze! Stop! Cuff him. Thank you. Go. Freeze, or I will shoot. Hurry up. Move, move! You bastards, where can you go? Are you alright? How is Wanchai Ox now? I don't know. Have you found Fatty? Not yet. Who is it? Knife can kill! It's alright, get it away. Brother Lamp. How is it? Are you alright? I am fine. Brother Lamp, any message? You are great! The tried and the police are looking for you. Uncle Lamp, please help Chuen for my dad's sake. Sorry, I can't. I must not to be involved in it. Hasn't you helping us? I will leave Hong Kong in a couple of days, migration. Brother Lamp, you mean it? How can you leave us behind? How can you say so? I've applied for migration for ages. Just something from me. You have planned. Chuen. I worked for 20 years, I've got car and flat. Look, gold chains all over my body. When I was young, I was more famous than you. I was a great fighter, everybody was scared by my name. I was great! But, you can't avoid such thing happened in the world of triads. Look, this is left. Don't move. Freeze. Who are you? 94 Po Liz. Are you bulling? What is 94 Po Liz? Anti Triad Bureau. Police. You are under arrest. Luckily Kent didn't aim sharp. Otherwise... I have to piss by anus. Why didn't you warn us earlier? My nick name is Magic Lamp. If you are wise, you'll get my points. If not, you'll not make use of it. I've reminded you for many times. But, young guys won't listen to the old. Chuen, if you can go straight! I don't know what thing have I done wrong. I killed a guy to revenge my buddy. Why Brother Piu sacrificed me? You did nothing wrong, but timing is wrong. You made Piu take all the responsibility. So, you must be sacrificed. I am leaving tomorrow, work it out yourself. Fai Chuen, hope you are as lucky as me. Thank you. I've finished what I want to say. No home today! I don't want to play any more, I am tired. I don't know why, I just want to see my mom. I want to go home too. Hurry up. We'll gather one hour later in the restaurant. Chuen? Come and drink your favourite soup. Drink while it's still hot. Nice? Beware, it's hot. Any more? Do you still want more? Drink mine. I'll get you a bowl of rice. I want one more bowl of soup please. Some more? Alright. Brother Chuen... Brother Chuen... Chun, how are you? Nothing. How is your result? Bad? Or anything? I'm one of the top outstanding students this year. Bravo! You are famous! You'll be the star of the whole village. I would like to greet you boss. Stop fooling me. Fai Chuen, say something! He doesn't want to further his studies. A friend's words are much more better than parents advice. Chun, give me a cold tea please. Chuen, police comes to you. I'll go with Ostrich. Have you seen your mom? She is the closest relative of you. Visit her always. And, everytime she goes shopping. She comes to see whether you are here or not. Advise him if you have chance. Thank you. Always nagging? Jose, you bastard! You took my son to hook! Uncle Hoi, I don't know why! You must be a lucky guy. Once I took your son for whoring. I paid everything. Even the condom. He refuses be prefers chicken congee. What a chicken! It's better to be chicken in this case. Are you fooling me? Just kidding. No? Chun, be frank. No daddy would harm his own son. Remember. I will have tea with you some other day. Don't forget. Remember to call me. Thank you. Welcome. Go working. Brother Chuen. Run. Stop! Brother Chuen... What're you doing? I can listen to you.
