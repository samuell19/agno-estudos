DECEMBER 2015 Hey, kid! Come here! Take a picture for me. Hello. They're up already? Then feed them. I'm coming. What? Elísio, it's for you. He's coming. It's either today, or I have other offers. This land is mine. It's settled. Then drop by later with the deposit. R$10,000. Today? Impossible. Can't leave my job. It's the holidays, the housekeeper's nightmare. Tomorrow there's no guarantee. Did you get the money? I did? What a question! -Hey, Marcia. -All good? -Great. How's the baby? -Fine. -How many hot lunches today? -Four. -They'll be here soon. Bye. -Bye. THREE SUMMERS You must make a wish, Dad. Hello. Madá! Madá! Hold this. Give me your phone. -My phone? -Yes. -But it's prepaid? -I'll top up later. Did you throw your flowers? Here. Take it all away. I'm feeling generous today. Give away whatever you don't like. Mrs. Marta, what about the money I mentioned? We have different priorities today, dear. But it's a unique opportunity! Look at this. Brand new. Never used it. Pity, no? Find someone who wants it. It won't fit you. Could you give me the deposit today? It has to be today. -Today? -Yeah. Doesn't your church celebrate Christmas? Look how Edgar is? He's in bad shape. True. And the cash he lent you? Paying it back. Two months to go. It's coming out of my salary. Never saw that money. I have so many debts. -If I can, I'll talk to him. -Please do. Turn it once more. Once more. Don't touch the painting. If anyone asks, it's a new São Paulo artist. He had a show in Tokyo. Marta, hello! Tokyo? Wasn't it Rome? I embarrassed myself the other day. He's selling like crazy in Japan. To the left. To my left. Return it after New Year's. Shush. João Paulo and Angela are coming. They loved my collection, my taste for art. -Our taste. -Ours. There are 3 supermarkets near Luca's new place. At least that. It won't make a difference, but? -Watch out! -What? That's a Tunga. A lifetime of your salary wouldn't pay for it. Really? And how much is it? Anybody seen Luca? What's this made of? Cement? Don't touch it! -Would anybody buy this? -Yes. -Do these sell? -A lot. It's a Tunga. Ask Elísio to put it at the entrance. -Stop it. Is this expensive? -Yes, it costs a fortune. -Gloves. -Yes, he'll wear gloves. Careful with the ornaments. Watch out. -Can't believe he is here! -Who is it? It's the guy with the ankle monitor. -That's him. -Who? Cida worked for him. Not me. Elísio did. Open it! He must be traumatized by locked doors. There was a fuss. Police showed up. -Looking for him? -He was in the kitchen. They thought he fled. There was no signal. -Like phones? -Yes. So old-fashioned! They're rich. They should find something better to arrest themselves. Madá, where are the bathrobes? -Trying to impress her? -Give me a bathrobe. -Say it. -Please. -You're getting my house wet. -Sorry. Your mom wants you in the TV room. Help yourself. It's good. Taste it. You'll like it. -Say it. -Thanks. Taste one. What's this? Sushi? Yes, it's “sushisage,? sushi sausage. People here don't like raw food. You don't have it where you live? -She's a vegetarian. -Poor girl? So cute? She only eats salad? Do you like Brigadeiro? She doesn't know what it is. How do you say “bread?? And cheese? Poor girl. She's never had any of this. Pity. Dear, where's a good place to open a kiosk there in your country? Packed and ready to go? Keep on laughing. I'll get rich selling cheese puffs. This is really cute. Look, Cida. Octopus sausage. So cute! I used cloves for the eyes. -You're so creative! -Take a picture! Vanessa? One like this, another like this. You'll be rich. -Cool. -Nice? Take some menus too. You scared me! -What are you doing here? -Getting the hot lunches. Our guy will take them. Delivery only. Elísio will deliver them. You can't come here. Delivery only. Use WhatsApp. They can't come here. Put it on Instagram and Facebook: delivery only! Imagine if Mr. Edgar finds out I'm doing this. God forbid! CHINA WEDDING ANNIVERSARY ONCE UPON A TIME? What's with that hair? That's crazy! My hair used to be just like that. You had that hair when we've met. -Look at that! -I have a good nose for men. -That was a borrowed dress. -Marta, don't tattle! What comes after china anniversary? Paper? Let me see? 21st anniversary, brass or nickel. China means refinement. Requires many stages to be made. -Refinement? -Refinement and patience. There's all sorts of celebration, wood, iron, cotton? The main thing is to celebrate. THE FAMILY IS COMPLETE? Look at that. So cute! Twenty years? It goes by so fast. Look at him. Don't be like that. There's Skype and Internet now. It will be tough. Dad. Luca, come here. -Now? -Just for a bit. Need to talk to you. Get your grandpa out of that bedroom. He likes you. Tell him to come down. I know him. He won't come. Your dad is upset. He doesn't know what to do. He won't come. -Mention your grandma. -My grandma? Say something nice and he'll come. He won't come. What's this? Who's that? Same unknown number again. Oh, my Lord. Who's this? -Clayton must be feeling guilty. -God forbid. Clayton? I have just one thing to say to him. I'm sorry. -How do you say I moved on? -We don't say that any more. Now it's “follow the ball?. “Follow the ball?. I'm sorry. I don't know who it is, but came with Elísio. It's Ribamar. It's Ribamar! I'll hide down here. It's Ribamar! What do I do? What if it's a song? Let me help my friend! What if it's a film or a book? Take it easy, guys. -I didn't say a thing. -She didn't say a thing. Branca doesn't know anybody in Brazil, not even Anitta. A song, a song? O Sole Mio It's me! Ten calls from this number. I thought it might be urgent and you should answer. I didn't answer because it's “No Caller ID?. I don't answer such calls. You know why? When there's no number, it could be a scam. You shouldn't pick up. They call from jails. You did well not to answer. Do you know how to block a number? Of course I do, Mr. Edgar. Obviously. I taught Mrs. Marta to post pictures on Facebook. -Just block it. -You want it blocked? About that money that we discussed. I know you're concerned, but I am too. The guy is in the kitchen. I didn't dare go in. It's really important for me. I have to pay him today. This land for my kiosk is worth a lot. There's lots of mangos and bananas. Just by clearing the land, it will? Madá? Don't say anything to Marta. Don't tell her about the calls. -Honey. -Block it. -Everybody is waiting. -Coming. It's your turn. Sorry, everyone. -Your phone is really old. -It's crappy, right? I'm focused on the land, so I didn't upgrade it. Can I trust this guy? Is he your friend? Don't worry, Mr. Edgar. He's a nice guy. We can decide later about keeping the land in Madá's name. The land has to be registered in my name. Deduct it monthly from my salary, like always. I'll pay you back. -Madá. -Yes? I'll buy your phone. No way. Why would you want this crappy phone? I'm serious. R$10,000. -Really? -Yeah. Deal. Deal. My videos, my pictures. There's a lot there? We'll save them. You know how to do it? Yes, I'll do it. -Do we have Madalena's details? -I have it all. Don't worry. You know the one with the shepherd boy? -I've heard this song. -Do you know how to play it? I don't know. It was going to be a surprise, Dad. We found this while moving. We're really happy that you're here with us, Dad. Everybody knows it's been a tough year. Mom should've been here. I've heard this music. It's Beethoven. That's right. Thank you for being here. Merry Christmas! Louder! Merry Christmas! The loudest scream gets this one. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, everyone! Madá, where's mine? This is for you, my baby. Follow the kids. Dad, easy, easy? Honey, give me a hand. DECEMBER 2016 No, she's not here. Thanks. Hello. This is a message from Mr. Edgar and Mrs. Marta. But this is not her. This is Madalena, the housekeeper. Just to say we're calling off the Secret Santa. Ok? Secret Santa called off. But everything is fine. She will call you later to explain. Ok? Thank you. Do you prefer dimmed lights or bright lights? Use all of them. It'll be great! He thinks he's a celebrity. -Hi, Madá. -Ms. Branca! Didn't you hear? I'm getting a few things for Marta. -I won't be able to help you. -Don't worry, I'll manage. I'm canceling the Secret Santa with our guests. Are you leaving as well? Are they gone? She likes these? -Don't need that. -No? You see? Voicemail. I can't reach her. Nobody tells me anything. Don't know if I should cancel. Will they come for New Year's Eve? -They didn't tell you anything? -Nothing. So much food and drink. I hired some extra help. Do you think I should just cancel? I think you should. -Isn't it too late? -Why not try? Go, Madá. I don't want to bother you. Where are you taking these things? I'm meeting Marta later. Leave that alone! Mr. Edgar gets mad if we touch that drawer. -Did he request anything? -Go get me some water! You're very nervous. Hey. Do you want some Valium? Mrs. Marta likes it. Just one or two. Want some? How about some vodka? With ice and lime. Now, Madá! Ok. No power yet? What did you bring? Pork loin! Delicious! I think you owe me a faster service? Something to drink. Don't you have a friend who can help you? Hurry up. There's a lot to be done. Let me show you. I noticed when I arrived. This is totally uneven. The pool is tipping this way. If a child gets in, the water will spill. And I'll put a slide here. I'm pricing it. I'm planning a huge Christmas event here. I have tons of products. I don't want to just sell online. People will stop here to buy water or bananas, they'll see my tree of snacks with the Xmas decoration, and they'll stay. I'll sell pork loin and so on. The gifts are ready. -Can I get a hat? -They're for clients. How will we get our overdue wages? That's expensive stuff! You insane? -Why? -There's cameras. -So what? -She's on a plane, but she monitors everything remotely. He forgets we're in Big Brother Brazil. The only thing I want is my money. You're so stupid, Vanessa! Do you think the boss is coming as Santa Claus? Easy, honey. This trip is so weird. No one said anything. -Let's open this. -I'm looking? She's not posting anything. -You're stalking her? -I learned it from you. I'm the greatest? stalkist? -Stalker. -I'm the greatest stalker ever. I'll deliver your beloved in 3 clicks. I've always wanted to use this glass. Look at the glass he took? No need to eat like that. Are you a refugee? There's tons of food coming. Save your appetite. I couldn't cancel most of the food. I found a picture of her. Look at Mrs. Marta showing off. -Trips, shopping? -A lot of money. No! Don't touch that! They're stingy with that Xmas bread. They don't even let Mr. Lira eat it. And it's scary. Looks like a beanbag. -You guys can send me your CV. -Oh, yeah? I'll soon be hiring at Madá's Kiosk. Here's a sticker for everyone. When I'm your boss, I won't be as nice. It'll be different. You'll miss Mrs. Marta. -What about me? -I'd never forget you. He's scared to have me as his boss. You're right, be afraid. -Let's toast! -Let's. Go easy. Don't break the glasses. Cheers! Happy New Year! What's this? Thank God you arrived! -What's going on? -She's in charge. In charge of what? I have nothing to do with this. -Are you Madalena? -Yes. We're searching the house. -What happened? -We have a search warrant. Where is the computer? Wait a minute. Let me call my boss. Careful. That's a Tunga. Madá! Madá! -Mr. Edgar was arrested. -No way! -I'm serious. -Mr. Edgar? They're upstairs? I saw a woman and wondered who she was. They're everywhere. -Over here. -No need to go in there. It's Mr. Edgar father's bedroom. The warrant is for the whole house. He's got a weak heart. He'll drop dead. -Whose jewels are these? -My wife's. -Are there receipts? -I doubt it. She's had them for a long time. Were they gifts from your son? He doesn't live here. He's here because they're renovating his place. -It's outrageous! -Don't get nervous. They're doing this in all the houses. This phone number, 9775-6868? -What about it? -Where's the phone? No idea. Are you Madalena dos Santos Mariz? This number is listed in your name. 9775-6868. Mine is 99982-7666. Right? But that's not the only number you have. You have all of these. -All mine? -All in your name. -No? -Is this your ID number? -Yes, it is. -So, they're all yours. I only have one phone and it's prepaid. Is everyone here renovating? We all want to improve ourselves. -Do you have receipts for these? -For those? Never. These are leftovers from the neighbors' renovations. Tiles, cement? The receipts for the renovation of his dad's flat. Let me see. Strange, isn't it? 840 cement bags. They're 50-kilo bags. -The same company as here. -Are they building a palace? All under the name of Elísio Santana. -Do you know Elísio Santana? -I do. Elísio? He's like? A handyman at the complex. -Where's your renovation project? -It's nearby. Do you have the paperwork and the land deed? Mr. Edgar handled it all for me. He said the paperwork was in order. -It's just a testimony. -I can't go there today. I haven't made dinner for Mr. Lira. Give me the address and I'll stop by later. You don't understand. You don't have a choice. It's a bench warrant. Are you arresting her? She's innocent. No. She'll be in the front seat. And everyone will see me? Humiliating! There is Edmilson. I'm not being arrested. It's just a? what is it called? Bench warrant. It's just a bench. I'll be right back. Thanks. Vanessa, where is Mr. Lira? -I'm talking to you! Where's he? -Don't know. Mr. Lira! Mr. Lira! I don't believe this! Are you crazy? I can't believe this! What are you doing here? I feel like punching you! I've been looking for you everywhere. Let's go home! It's raining. You know what that means. It will flood, and the water will sweep you away. I was thinking, Madá. Me, a teacher. I've taught so many people. But didn't know how to raise my own son. You know what the lawyer said? That I shouldn't worry. There's even a library in jail. A library? When he was a kid, he was sick for about 3 months. Hepatitis. I'd read to him every night. He listened, but he wasn't interested. He never really enjoyed reading. You truly didn't know anything? To be honest, I never liked his friends. But arrested? A thief? Taking money from schools and hospitals? How could this happen? Tell me Madá, how? Elísio, I'll just get a few things. It'll be quick. Then you take me back to Rio. Mr. Lira, your Copacabana place is not ready yet. I don't mind being there during the renovation. I just want to go back home. -The work has stopped. -Stopped? Since when? A few weeks. There was a court injunction. No one can enter. What about my kiosk? You'll have to wait. They say he bribed everyone for construction permits, now everything will stop? Be thankful you're not in jail. I won't let this happen! You know the one with the shepherd boy? -I've heard this song. -Yes? Don't give me that look! They didn't deposit a dime? I'm doing miracles. Took it from the cash reserves. -Any idea when we'll get paid? -You see a crystal ball? Sign it. Is it off now? The image comes and goes, but I can still see it. Must be this one. -Is it ok now? -It's ok. -And this one? -Just turn it a bit. I'll turn it to the left. Tell me if it's ok. MERRY CHRISTMAS MRS. MARTA AND MR. EDGAR A bit to the left. Let me loosen it. -Ok? -Yes. He's on. Look. Hi, everyone. -Can you see me? -Yes. -Do you see me well? -Yes. So? I talked to Edgar. You know about his difficult situation. He asked me to say how fond he is of you all. Ok, Mr. João Paulo. What about our salaries? Vanessa still has no letter of recommendation. I got her a night job, but walking around late is dangerous. We'll cover some expenses. Don't worry. In this hard moment, Edgar says he didn't forget you. But what about the overdue salaries? I'm getting someone to bring you some money. Don't worry. All Edgar asks is for a bit of understanding. -Jump in, Emerson! -I will! Go! I dare you! How deep is it? Holy shit! -Aren't you coming in? -I can't swim. The water is great! Imported, imported? Brazilian. Strike a pose. One, two, three and? You look gorgeous. Want to see a necklace or something else? Shoes! You need shoes to match the clothes. It's llama fur. -Beautiful, no? -I like it. You have to hide it. Nowadays it's forbidden. It's one of the last of its kind in the world. Loved the mirror too. Mrs. Marta said if you wear this where she lives, you can go to jail. Or people throw things at you. Here, there's no control. It's beautiful. Feel it. -When would you wear this? -About 3 days a year. Look around! Want things for your home? Here's a basket. Crazy sale! So many bargains! The Buddhas. These normally cost as much as a car. It's not my style, but I see you like it, right? Take these Buddhas. They're from Japan. China, somewhere? They're so heavy! They look great! Want to take them? You'll see it in lots of stores, in Pirate's Mall? You want the smallest one? You should take both to match. Take them both. R$60, R$30 each. -You haven't cut it in a while? -Yeah. Great choice. Vanessa, she'll take both Buddhas. Great! Madá, this is not a Buddha. It's a samurai. Isn't it? -It's all the same. -No. Buddha is the fat one. I've seen skinny Buddhas. There's all kinds of Buddhas, young, old, fat, skinny? I just want to get rid of this junk. Contradictions in Brasilia. Clues to millionaire withdrawals. I have a surprise for you. Come and see. You get on my nerves with your joy. Where does it come from? -Come and see. -I told you I'm not leaving. No need to leave. It's inside the house. -Come, Mr. Lira. -You wanted me to eat. -I've eaten. -You have? Wasn't it delicious? -Not so bad. -See? It's inside the house. Can't you come? Get out of this bed. Enough! Operation Car Wash exposed massive corruption? Time to move on! Do you see the paintings? Beautiful. Smell this. Lovely. I used things like scented candles to mimic a fancy hotel. New bedroom, new life. Let's turn the page. Let's change rooms. It's all we can do for now. I'm scared. How do I get on? It's hard to dance. It's hard to dance on the high seas. It's video. Emerson, look here. Actually, don't look. We'll fall. Serve the açaí. This is included. First-class açaí for you. Thank you. So many toppings you don't taste the açaí. Very tasty! If you like it, we also deliver. This is a great spot. Pay attention, folks. Here, you have a panoramic view of the villas. On my left, the house that's boarded up. That one was confiscated. That house, the guy's in jail. He's from the meatpacking plant. Remember? You saw him on the news. He's in jail. On our left? Look at that house. Belongs to that helicopter guy. Remember? Also in jail. There's someone there. Yes. You're lucky. Go! Film him! Walking back and forth? He's under house arrest. He's in there. What about that one? The big house with lots of glass, empty. It belongs to foreigners. They're not in jail. If it's well-kept, functioning, it's a foreigner. Or a soccer player. Look there. Here there are 3 or 4 who are not in jail. They're soccer players. Madá, good thing you're here. Look at these pictures. Take a look. You took them? I still need to edit them. Digital is amazing. Sometimes I think I was born too early. This is awesome. Have you worked with this? With these pictures, we can pay lots of bills and keep the paintings. God forbid! I signed all the paperwork. What do you mean? Let's say you wanted to travel to the beach and saw these pictures in an ad, wouldn't you stay here rather than go to a hotel? Stop it! You're kidding. For instance? We can create a page on the Internet. There's a service I used with Rosinha? When we went to Paris, instead of going to a hotel, we stayed at someone else's place. Of course! Why didn't I think of this? Mr. Lira, it's like that “Harry BnB?! -Did you make a wish? -Yeah. -What did you wish? -Can't say or it won't happen. -I'm not superstitious. -But I am. Wasn't much help. Neither to you. DECEMBER 2017 Where's Santa Claus? Santa! Cut! Again? I told you ten times! We need snow on both sides. It's only falling here! -I saw it. -Did you? On both sides! Leo! Reflection! Lose the reflection on the painting and on his glasses! I told you, Leo. For God's sake! -Santa, you're great. -They're so nervous! Too much stress. Ho-ho-ho and? Just a sec. Watch your mark. Up to that mark. Hey, Antonio, my friend. Yeah. Just a second. Jana, go over with them what I said. You say, “Santa Claus!? End of December? Let's go, Donizete. Quick! Look at the fake champagne! Told you. Doing it many times wouldn't work. -I need 20 minutes to set it up. -20 minutes! Don't stress him. He cleaned over and over. But I need to solve this. -I'm hungry! -Do it in 10 for me. I don't like this one! -There's strawberry, chocolate. -But it's crap. Guys, we need to finish this take today. We didn't plan snow for so many takes! Hey, sweetie. -Do you want a fruit? -No, thanks. I hate seeing a kid go hungry. I get it. Send me the script. By email. There's still snow on the couch. It's ok. Look at his pants. -Oh, no! -Can someone clean here? From the top. Come on, Donizete. I need a clean cloth here. I need to clear the set. Quickly. I need to clear the set. Go, sound. Go, snow. Go, camera. Go! “Super Christmas?, Take 8. Action! Where's Santa Claus? Santa! You too can have the Christmas of your dreams! Today our guest is Jonas, from Mossoró. Cut. Cut! You forgot the snow! -Cut the sound. -Thank God! These are heavy. They're turbo. Way better than AC. We'll be back in 20 minutes! “I thought my Christmas wouldn't be special.? -Then? -The Super Christmas? Ok, from the top. “I thought my Christmas wouldn't be special, but Super Christmas?? Super Christmas? Super Christmas? “Super Christmas transformed your life.? Jesus Christ. Even I know it by now! Let's go from the top, Jonas. Forget her. Breathe. We have to figure this out. It's absurd. Now what, Paulo? The woman from the contest didn't show up. The crew is stressed. Thank God! I thought my food was the issue. They have to wrap up today no matter what. We might work overtime. Good for me. Soon you'll join their union. My first time? Sorry. He can't talk holding the microwave. -Nobody will notice. -He's stuttering. He says, “Su-super?? Wait! It's awful! “Super Christmas?, say it! -Super Christmas. -Yes! Super Christmas. Be natural. Sorry. Super Christmas. -Super Christmas. -Super Christmas. That's it. Sorry, Paulo. Super Christmas. Let's go. Focus. Silence, please. -Let's go! Focused? -Focused. Action! A bunch of photos. She travels a lot. This is in Barcelona. So much money? In that place where they make movies. Hollywood. Wow! She left her husband and ran away with her son? Luca already lived there. You think she wasn't guilty? I'm not vouching for anyone. Did you see it? Mrs. Marta and Luca in LA? Of course I saw it. -Will the auction take place? -No way! We filed a labor complaint. Not one, but ten. It's not going anywhere. She's practically a lawyer. Right, Madá? I have to be. Policemen here all the time. They took me to court. I had to go. Bench warrant. Now I know everything. Ever seen lawyers on TV say “data venia?? No. Never seen them saying that Latin phrase? It means “so sorry, but??. It comes before something bad. Data venia, your hair looks horrible. First Instance, Second Instance? I know them all. -Oh, my! -What is it? Look at this! “The bedroom is cozy and clean. The host replied to all my messages kindly and swiftly.? That's me: kind, swift? That's me pretending to be you. Amazing! I told you being partners was a good idea. See? Several messages in English, Spanish. Scroll up and you'll see the badge we got. What's this “superhost? thing? It's the same as 5 stars. We're awesome! We're VIP. Super VIP. So it'll be perfect. I'll leave you all this. It's a beautiful encyclopedia. -Is it? -Take good care of it. -What's it for? -To learn whatever you want. If you want to know where Ethiopia is, look it up. Or what the Greeks used to eat. It's all there. Why not just Google it? I don't want that. It's too dusty. Too much of a hassle. Not for me. Mr. Lira, I want you to stay. How will I reply to all those messages? Spanish I can handle, but English? Madá, you think there's no Internet in Copacabana? I'll help you from there. Please, I'm begging you. Stay. You'll miss your last chance to get rich! This is not my home. It's my son's. Not really. It belongs to that Eugênio. God knows who he is. It doesn't make a difference. What about us? Here, in Eugênio's house. Of course it'll work. She has a great face. Ordinary, simple? Let's use her. Hey, Antonio! Of course! A Northeastern look. It could work. But the other actress? No, thanks. She was a lot younger. I don't think the clothes will fit. But she isn't coming. Our target was upper-middle class women. She's working class at best. But that other old man looked poor as well. That's true. Guys, it's all we have. Madá, we need you to sign a contract. Real simple. I'll explain it to you. Who says I'll do it? You've been calling me old, fat and poor. You think I'm deaf? Honey, it's not that. We're really stressed. Sorry, I was rude with you. Nothing like that. How much will I make? Nobody consults me beforehand, so this happens. I brought small and medium. Ok. Just a minute. Great, right? I'm not sure? I like it. Too fancy. Looks like she stole it from her boss. No, I inherited it. Put on some accessories. I'll have to come up with something. -Come in. -Come in! Ready? -Almost. -No. Did you finish? Yes. Jonas cried. It was great. -Poor guy. -Hurry up. Go, sound! -Go, camera! -Camera rolling. Action! This year, I lost my job. My husband too. And I was ashamed to ask people for money. So I took everything I had? and went? to a store to buy a mixer. -What comes after the mixer? -Cut! It's the other one, Jana. Do it with feeling, Madá! Feeling? -What do you mean? -From your heart. Think about Christmas. This year, I lost my job. My husband too. Losing a job is really sad. Let alone at Christmas. I was desperate. I took everything I had. And bought a mixer. I didn't mention the loan. Cut. The lines are wrong. She forgot the loan, but now she'll get it right. I have something to say. You said it was like Jonas's. His text was short, mine is way longer. It's the same. You talk about family? Madá, you need more rhythm. No make-up now! Excuse me! Guys! -She told me to. -Nobody told you to. Silence! I don't want water. Madá, focus. Again, quick! Let's go, Madá. -Relax, Madá! -Relax, let's go! Silence, please. When you are ready. Silence. Watch the boom mic! -Watch the boom mic! -Do I look at it? No, please don't. Look at the camera. He said, “Watch the boom!? Isn't that it? I'm stressed! Focus, Madá! Focus! One more. We're all with you. It'll be easy. She's nice, but she makes all these gestures. I don't know where I should be looking. -Jana, hold on. -Sorry. Let's help her out. Ok, go! I took all my savings? and bought a mixer. I took all my savings and bought a mixer. And began baking cakes to sell. -Where? -At the bus stop. With coffee. That's stupid. Who's going to take cake into a bus? How will they eat it? Brigadeiro is better. -No? -Focus, Madá. How will you manage to eat in Rio? I'll starve to death. I'll have to order your “sushisage?. Better if you stayed. Go on, Madá. Grandma's recipe. I began baking cakes using my grandma's recipe. So I paid off my debts and started my own business. You forgot to say that your husband was unemployed and he helped you in the end. I forget about the husband. Don't have one and don't want one! Think about a boyfriend you've had. I don't like this. It won't work. Anyone can tell it's a lie. I sound phony. I'll tell them I'm giving up. Focus, Madá. Let's go. Action, Madá. This year, my husband lost his job. Me too. Losing a job is really sad. Let alone at Christmas? I hate Christmas. I can't stand Christmas. I loathe Christmas! This actually happened to me. My husband, Marcos, lost his job? on Christmas Eve. And we? We had a baby girl. Life can be so tough? So hard? So many sad things? It's never been easy. It's never? It's so sad! A hard Christmas for me? Here's what happened. My mother was sick. My sister was taking care of her. My daughter, Ana Maria, was still a baby. My husband wasn't well. He was unemployed, at home, drinking? Didn't care about anything. On Christmas day? I hate Christmas! On Christmas Day, Ana, my daughter, was crying a lot. I felt her forehead and it was burning. Where could I get medicine? At the health clinic. It was far, uphill? I went despite the storm. An ungodly rain. Lightning and thunder. I ran and got there? It was closed. There was a sign saying that the doctors weren't working because they were not being paid. When I got home, there was a strange sound. It was pitch black, so much mud? I kept on walking. When I got there, the hillside had collapsed. I couldn't even find my house. When I left to get medicine, I had a husband, a sister, a mother? and had? my beloved baby. My little daughter. I can't stand Christmas! Never liked it. Cut. Get her a glass of water. Now a close-up when she talks about the supermarket. Ok, Jana? I'm sorry about that. So sorry about that. Do we still have snow? Do I have to do this all over again? Madá? Do you have a floor plan? I doubt it. Do you really need one? It's ok. I can measure it. It would be easier, but it's ok. So the idea is to expand the home office? As much as you can. He'll have to work from here. We'll transfer here everything he has in Rio. Ricardo. We need to remove any traces of Marta. We can make a full office. Perhaps it's better to use a different room. Whatever works. -But he can't leave this house. -Can I go as far as the balcony? Mr. Lira. FUNERAL HOME How can something smell so good and taste so awful? How could Mr. Lira like this? “Madá, you will like it there. The address is Ave. Nossa Senhora de Copacabana, n. 1986. Apartment 503. It's not fancy, but it's great. From the back, you can even see the sea. It's lively and joyful. Just like you. The Wi-Fi password is Rosinha. It's 11:50 PM, last moments of 2017. Pretty soon, we'll be in 2018. We'll be here exchanging all this energy and emotions. It's time to celebrate? -Madá! -What? Where do you keep the glasses? In the green cupboard, by the oven. Find them? Yes! Let's go to Copacabana. -It's already New Year in Japan! -So, let's celebrate! Let's take a selfie! Come take a picture, Elísio! Coming! Who would have thought? -What about me? -I'd never forget you. Let's toast. Go easy! Don't break my new glasses. Happy New Year! It's starting! It's starting. It started. Look! Don't fall! Not in my apartment! Go die far away. I won't fall. So beautiful! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Wish you all good health! Money! A lot of money! Work and everything. -Let's go to the beach! -Yes! So beautiful! Wait for me! Wait for me!
