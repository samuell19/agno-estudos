Zoraza! Zoraza! Ioan! Ioan! Zoraza! Lana! Zoraza. Zoraza! Oh my God, hi! - Hey, man. - Here's your bag. - How are you? - What's up with you? - Darling. - I'll put these back here. How you doin'? - You ready? - Yeah. Here, take my bag. So, you guys hungry? Fuck yes! You don't count, you're always hungry. Not always. Yeah, always. Anyways, you ate my food on the plane. How could you be so hungry? Well, I wasn't going to eat the plane food that's for sure. Guys, relax, it's Italy, guys. The country is probably fucking made of food. Mark's probably made of food. Yeah. I want a beer. I want a nice chair to relax in. - Yeah. - You got it. What about your girlfriend? Hmm, yeah, that too. Well, I have a solution to one of those things. - Wow, wow! - Woo hoo! - Ah. - Woo! What? You guys thought I'd let you do this road trip sober? That's what I'm talking about. Are these? Toronis. Toronis? From the mother country herself. You bet your fucking ass. - Cheers, guys! - Cheers, guys. Woo hoo! This is gonna be a killer time. I know I asked Jody, but how was the flight? Boring. He means long. No, I meant boring. They had literally two in-flight movies, two! They weren't that bad. They were bad. I thought it was exciting. They had Spiderwick Chronicles and Speed Racer. What the fuck am I supposed to do with that? I love Speed Racer, I thought it was really exciting. You think everything's exciting. Fuck you! Ooh, let me check my schedule. Guys. You're here, you're okay. That's what's important. When are we going to be there? Hold your horses, we'll be there soon. I love Italy, this is so exciting. Guys. Welcome to your home for the next two weeks. Looks like a place out of time. Yeah, this place is giving me some weird vibes. Guys, I'm sure it will be fine. Fuck. What's up? The gate, it's not opening. The electricity is probably off. When was the last time you were here? Never been here. So, then how did you find it? Inheritance. I'm gonna have to open it manually. Hey, who's that? Who's who? The woman, right there. She was right there. Ashley, nobody lives here. Come on. I swear I saw something. - Chris. - Yeah? Nobody lives in the house, right? Nobody's lived in this house since the '40s. It's open. Let's go. Yeah. Guys, welcome to Dumitrescu's Mansion. Is that really what it's called? Yeah, what's wrong with it? I don't know, it's a bit long and it sounds creepy. What the fuck? Wow. I think this looks fantastic. It must have cost a fortune to buy this. Trust me, it wasn't. That's too bad. I like the idea of having a rich boyfriend. Then I think you're gonna have to look elsewhere. Wow, that's amazing. It belongs to my family. Dad told me that my grandfather bought it at an auction, but surprisingly, it didn't cost a lot of money. Why don't you live here? Have you seen it? Redoing the whole house would have cost a fortune. And unfortunately for Jody, she doesn't have a rich boyfriend. So, we thought it would be better if we leave it. Maybe one day we'll sell it. Sorry. Why would a house like this not cost a lot of money? Well, to be honest, there were some stories. Nothing major, just some stupid stories. Okay, I'll let you guys get settled in. I have to check the upstairs. Want some help with those things? Yeah. If you can take some and put it next to Jody's stuff, that would be great. You're gonna stare at them or actually gonna walk inside? All right, yes, I'm coming. Hey, tell me about the scholarship, huh? They really gonna give you money? Yeah. Actually they're gonna give me money. I would never give you money. Well, thanks. - Oh, no problem. - That's why it's good you don't work as a college administrator. Well, no shit. Yeah, I don't know. What? I took my lesson on biology and I, I wanted to die. So, I think I'm gonna try for a BA instead of a BS. Yeah, I always loved taking pictures. So, I'm thinking of switching. Well, you're not really good at drawing, so that's not a great plan. There's more art than just drawing, man. You bet. So how's it going? Good, good. Just a little bit tired. Have you looked around here? Not really. This place is fucking amazing. Everything here is just so gorgeous. I really need this. Yeah, you're telling me. Oh wait, I didn't tell you. Chris and I are moving to the city. Really, that's amazing! Last time you talked about it, you were... You seemed so in into Pittsburgh. I mean, I meant to tell you sooner, but I think I am actually ready. For what? - Man, that's awesome! - Shh! Keep it for yourself, okay? - It's a secret. - Okay. Yeah, but I think I'm ready now. You really like her? Yeah, I really do. Hey. How are the ladies doing? The ladies are doing well. Just hanging around, taking some pictures, and have you seen these trees? Yeah, I know, they're fucking awesome. Wanna join us? No, thanks. I just gotta make sure the gate is closed. Oh guys, have you seen Mark somewhere? No. Last time I saw him, he had his phone and he was headed into the bathroom. Asshole. Listen, I cannot control what he does in the bathroom. By the way, I need some help inside. So, if you do see him, let me know, okay? Do you really love him? Come on, he's not that bad. I'm just saying. Darling, you have to think bigger. What? Bigger. Hmm. Who's there? Hello? Boo! You're not funny. Fuck off, idiot! Come on, it was a joke. Ashley! Fucking bitch. Hi, this is Eric, I'm not home right now. Leave a message, and I'll contact you back shortly. Hey, Eric. It's me, Ash. Just want you to know that I landed. Flight was okay. Bit of turbulence landing in, but I survived. You would've died. Chris brought us to the mansion and we just settled in. The place is like really weird. It's not too bad. It's actually pretty beautiful, but I don't know. Probably just me. I need to talk to you soon. It's about Nick. I don't think I should have come here with him. He's all detached and like my mind is somewhere else. I don't know. Maybe it's just the house. I've been in some of the rooms and I swear, people have been butchered in there. Something's off. I know it's stupid. I should have taken my pills, right? God, what am I saying? Anyway, I hope you're well and talk to you soon. Bye. Hey, Chris. What? The guys want to know where they're staying. Why were you staring at the woods? Nothing, don't worry about it. Okay. You've been acting pretty weird since we got here. Aren't you happy to see me? Of course I'm happy to see you. I was just thinking about the house. I've been wondering lately if it's worth keeping. I mean, we could sell it. We could go back to New York and get an apartment and live together. What do you think about that? That would be fantastic. I would love nothing more. But this has been in your family for years. You think it's right, just to sell it like that? I don't know. Here, I'll just be a minute. Go back inside. Okay. We have some beer, some music playing downstairs. Wanna come? Maybe. - Maybe? - In a bit. You're drawing again. Yeah. It's just this place, you know. It's so inspiring and gives me a lot of ideas. Mm. Want me to get you a drink? Yeah. You know Nick, we're just so different. I know that you thought us coming here would help us forget about Shanghai. Ugh, let's not talk about Shanghai. Let's not talk about Shanghai, come on. Yeah, but maybe it would be easier if we just... What? What was that? I don't know. I swear to God, if it's Mark, I'm gonna kill him. It's empty. Really? Oh, wait, there's a picture. Picture? Yeah, look. Look at that. Hmm, 100 years old. Yeah. Look at their clothes. Who do you think they are? Maybe the old owners. Yeah, maybe. You know what? I don't care. Let's go downstairs. Okay. So, there were two officials dancing there, when one was dancing with the other, and they both kind of flew off the dance floor together. We'll have one sip, one sip and then we'll come back. We won't be long. - Hey! - Hey. Where you been? No way, I don't want to know that. Okay, let's get you to the couch. Hey! - Hey buddy. - Woo! - Oh no. - Hello. Sorry I was late. Ah, free beer! Do it yourself. Come on, come on! - You drink now, come on. - You drink it. Oh what's that? - Fuck you. - What, drink. All right, all right. So she walks up to me and says, "Hey, how are you?" I didn't know who she is. - Hey. - Huh? How'd you sleep? My head hurts like shit so not too well. Here, take this. It'll help. What is it? It'll make you feel better. It's Advil, what the fuck do you think it is, LSD? Thanks. Who do you think these people are? These people? I don't know. It's like these paintings are full of sadness and grief. I don't know. Yeah, sure. Hey, so Mark and I are going into the village to get some food, do you want to come with us? Sure, see if... I'm gonna ask Ash, she might want to come. What's going on? Get me out of here. - I'm here, I'm here. - Please get me out of here! I'm here, I'm here. Ash. I'm sure it's nothing. I'm sure it's just your imagination. No, it's not my imagination. I'm not fucking crazy, I saw something. Cold. How about we go get a drink? Downstairs. Okay. What's going on? Well, it seems like we're not going anywhere 'cause this piece of doesn't want to start! What the fuck is that? An animal. Must have gnawed on the cables. Must have spent the night in the hood. How does an animal even get in the hood? Yes, but how is it even possible? We have a problem here, guys. And I'm not talking about this, I'm talking about Ashley. She found like a mannequins room and she got in there and came out scared to death. I'm sure she's delusional, but she's sure she saw something so. Like what? No idea. Well, tell Ashley to smoke less and not walk around alone. The real problem is that we're stuck here without food. Well, what if we tried to walk into town? We can't, there are miles of woods around us. Are you sure? Trust me, I'm sure. Yep. Try it now. Damn it! Fuck! I give up. There should be a place around here that sells spare parts. I'm going back inside. If I have to spend any more time in this piece of shit van, then I'll kill myself. Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and do nothing. Is there any way we can get food without having to go into town? Possibly. What do you mean? My grandfather was obsessed with the war. While one ended, he always feared another one would start. I think he must've hid some provisions somewhere in the house. Maybe the old kitchen. It was built to hold the army during the war. I think we could find something down there. Even if he had, all the food will have gone bad by now, right? Well, do you have any bright ideas? In any case, canned food is hard to expire. Well, anything is better than just laying around here. What are you guys waiting for? I'm not going anywhere. Hey guys, do you have any signal? Mine's off. We're in the middle of nowhere. Of course we don't have any signal. Okay, let's just focus on one thing at a time, all right? We should find the food first. Now, who wants to come with me? How about this? Ashley, Valerie, you guys go and look for the food. Meanwhile, Nick and I will keep trying to get the car started. That's fine. I thought I told you I was scared. Valerie's with you. If something happens, she'll protect you. It's better than just wandering around the halls. Fine. So, how long have you and Nick been together? Three years. Oh wow. You know I've always loved you guys as a couple. Yeah, well not everything is as it appears. What do you mean? Nothing, don't worry about it. You can tell me. Well, last year I was sent on a trip to Shanghai for the company I work for. It was their shareholder meetings and they sent me as their representative. One night, I went out to the bar with some guys and I got really drunk, and I slept with someone. Someone? A woman, I slept with a woman. I'm bisexual, so it hasn't been easy. Wow. Yeah, but don't tell anybody. Mm-hmm. But how was it? Really? Sorry. So, how long have you known. Known what? Um, that your... I'm not a lesbian, I just like men and women. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. Don't worry. Come here. Mark. Come on, it's been two days. I can't take it anymore. Mark. Mark, come on. Oh fuck yeah, come here. Hey, I think I may have found something. Pass me the flashlight. Did you hear something? Like what? Oh, nothing. Probably that's me. Is that food? I hope so, I'm fucking starving. It must have come from there. - So? - Nothing. There's nothing here. Let's go back. Oh, ride that shit, baby. Yeah. Yeah. Oh fuck yeah. Fuck! What's your fucking doing, idiot? Sorry, Jody, I saw something. No, you didn't, you're just feeling guilty. Jody, wait, please. Jesus. Jody! Damn it! Bitch. What the hell is this shit? This is what we have. And it's probably better than the shit you're used to. If we'd go to town, then we wouldn't have to eat any of this garbage. When you think the van's gonna be ready? I'll try again tomorrow. I'm burned out. We have to find some way to replace part of the engine, and I don't know anywhere we can get parts. I don't think walking through the woods would be any good idea. Hey guys, I think I've found something. What kind of paintings are these? It looks awful. I saw her. What? Nick, remember the mannequin room? When I fell down and you found me on the floor? Yes. Fuck you, I'm not joking. I saw her, that woman. Why would I lie? Come on, Ash, don't be ridiculous. I don't think she's being ridiculous. I found this too. What? It's not possible? What do you mean it's not possible? That's my grandfather's diary. I remember he used to tell me stories. What stories? You guys better come into the living room. Okay guys, there's something I have to tell you. My grandfather bought the house at an auction during the war. It was a bargain. He used the mansion as a way to help the Allies. And then, after the war, he used it as his home. But he said before long, he had discovered a diary that belonged to the old owners. Some guy named Vladimir Dumitrescu, his wife... He apparently was a wealthy Romanian merchant who came here for business and bought the house. His wife was devoted to the rites of Satanism, so she did it in secret. One night Zoraza along with other adepts evoked an ancient witch, a stridge. What? Shut up. A stridge, it's a witch. A witch of ancient and dark origins with powers far beyond imagination and evil. It's a demon essentially. Among the most horrible in satanic lore. Anyway, the demon took possession of Zoraza, and in the middle of the night, she chased and killed the children. Vladimir went insane and chased his wife, knowing that the thing that was in front of him was no longer the woman he loved. Wow. And what happened? He wounded her to death and nailed her to the ground with her face turned so no one could see that the thing was no longer his wife. After weeks of agony, he killed himself. My grandfather, after learning of this, left the house and never returned. I don't know what happened after. My parents never listened to his request to resell the property, so when he died, the house remained with us as part of the inheritance. So, knowing all of these stories and everything that has transpired here, you still brought us? And all so you wouldn't have to be alone. Jody, it's none of that, all right? They're just stories. That's all they are. Besides, I need the money to buy our apartment in New York, right? I was just supposed to check on the estate again, to decide what to do with it. I don't like any of this, all right? I don't need to be creeped out anymore than I already am. Guys, they're just old fake stories that were told during the war. Well, then I'm gonna take a look. Please, don't. Chris, if there's nothing wrong with the diary, what's the problem taking a look? You guys should just forget about the book, all right? The less you know the better. The less we know the better? Is there something you're not telling us? Of course not. There's nothing real in it so there's no need to read it. Do you think the book is real, right? Okay guys, enough. Chris, Jesus, why are you making this up? You're the one that came here with the book and the canvas. Okay, why don't we just change the subject and go back to it again. In the kitchen. Good idea. I think I'm gonna throw up. We should put the book back where we found it and forget it even exists. Ash, give Chris the book back. Wait a sec, there's a map. A map. Wow. Hey guys, I think there's something here, right below us. What? What's below us. A crypt? I'm not really sure, maybe a grave. Okay, let's go and check. You guys are fucking crazy. Come on, it could be fun. I'm not doing it. Whatever. Mark and I will have lots of fun. It must be here. What are we looking for? See, on the map, there has to be an entrance. It's hard to say, it could be hidden. I can't believe you guilted me into coming with you. I have no intentions to be down here alone again. Come on, guys. - Let's go back. - Chris, you're just worried. Why don't you go back up and fix the van, huh? Jesus. Come on. Whatever, I'm getting out of here. Ashley? Okay. Hey, Jody, this way. Hi. Hi, Mark. What are you doing? I just want to have a little fun. It's dark, it's gloomy. I think it's a little sexy. Where you get your idiotic ideas from is clueless to me, but we're not going to have sex next to dead people. Why not? The fact that you don't know why is reason enough. You don't believe any of Chris's stories, right? Of course, I don't. Because they are ridiculous. They're ridiculous, ridiculous! Yes, I understand, it's ridiculous. - Of course they are. - Oh my God. Why are you so off? They are ridiculous, like this! They are ridiculous, come on. It's really ridiculous. - Ridiculous. - I think it's ridiculous. Okay, I get it. Mark, come over here. Stop recording everything, we need to focus. It's my vacation too. I have a right to make memories. Whatever. What is it? I don't know. It seems like some sort of ashes. It's looks like bones with something attached to it. Look at the holes in the ground. Yeah, I remember. She was nailed face down into the ground. Oh my God, I think we've found her! Are you okay? I, I don't know. It's burning like hell! What the fuck, Jody? Don't mess around! Okay? Hey, Jody? Jode? Hey guys. Where are the others? Seems like they found a crypt or something down there. I tried to get them to turn back, but they wanted to keep going. You know what, let them have their fun. I'm going to bed. Yeah, me too. - Are you coming? - Yeah, I'll be up in a sec. Hey man, how you doing? Yeah. I dunno. I feel like Jody's been slipping away from me lately and I failed everyone. How? I feel like everyone is scared and that's all because my grandfather's horror stories. Listen, I'm sure it's not as bad as you think. Mark and Jody went off witch hunting, right? But, I mean, this doesn't mean she's slipping away from you. Okay, they went witch hunting. Yeah, you're right. - Witch hunting, aye? - Yes. Come on. Jody? Jody. Jody? Jody. Jody. Hey baby, what are you doing? Jody? Hey. Fuck! All right, I'm gonna go to bed. - Yup. - Are you good? I'll be up in a second. Okay. Mark. Mark, I'm not in the mood for a joke right now, okay? Mark. Mark. Mark, I'm not in the mood for a joke right now. Please, Mark. Nick. Nick. Ugh, fuck. Valerie? Are you all right? - Where's everyone else? - I don't know. Nick was sleeping, and I didn't have time to look for Chris. He must be in his room. When I looked in Valerie's room, she was gone. It must've taken Valerie. We have to go now! Guys, what the hell is going on? Mark, where did the blood come from? We have to go now! Ash. Ashley. Ash. Ashley. Hey, is everything good? Yeah. No! No, no, no, no, please. Guys, what the hell is going on? You were right Chris, about everything. What are you talking about? We found the witch, it's real, all of it. - The witch? - Yes. We were exploring the area and then Jody started touching the ground, and there was sediment, maybe ash. And then we found a skull, and nails and a body. Jesus. Mark. Why the fuck would you go looking for something that was never supposed to be found in the first goddamn place? I don't know. I'm sorry, okay? Christ. - Where's the diary? - I don't know. We lost it somewhere. And what about Jody? She's gone insane. She was injured with a nail. Then a voice, a fucking voice! It was all around. And one second she was there, and then she was gone. Then I found her and she was... What? She was something horrible. No, no, no. This can't be true. I'm sorry, okay. Should've listened to you guys. I won't fucking die here. I won't. I'm sorry. I'm an asshole and I probably deserve this shit. I deserve it. Nobody deserves this. I promise all of you we will make it out of here. No, I do deserve this. You think I'm a good person? Well, I'll tell you right now that I'm not. What are you talking about? Nothing, nevermind. No, it's obviously something. You don't want to know it, okay? Say what's on your mind. Me and Jody, we've been... What? Chris, I meant to tell you sooner, but I knew... You fucking asshole! - That's enough of this! - I'll kill you! Stop it, now! Enough! In case you didn't notice, there's a fucking monster chasing us, and you guys are fighting, come on! However deserving, it should happen at a later time, right? Not know, God! If we ever make it outta here, you and me, we're done. Is that clear? Come on. What are you doing? I'm gonna try to call the police. What do you expect them to do? Maybe to get us out of here, at least, so we could end this madness. Hello, can I help you? Hello, hello? I can't hear you. Hello? Hello? Please someone track the last call, now. Sure. Hello? Hello? Fuck. What? I lost the signal. We are trying to track your position, can you hear me? Hello? Shit. Get ready, we're going around town. Okay. Mark, why? Why did you do it? I'm sorry. It wasn't like we planned it. - It just happened. - How does that just happen? I don't know, I'm sorry. You're not sorry, not yet. Dick. I'm never going to forgive you, but right now we, we need to get out of here, and we need each one of us. We are going to die here. How do you expect us to get outta here? We will, trust me. Trust you. How about you just fuck off you piece of shit! All you are is an idiot. This is all your fault! We told you to forget about the diary, but no, you wanted to go exploring. And now we're cornered on the edge of this fucking mansion with nowhere to go, so just shut the fuck up, okay? Stop it, this isn't useful for anyone. We have to stay calm and think. Most importantly, we have to stay all together. I'm sorry, okay? All I wanted to do was be happy. Can you blame me for that? All I wanted to do was be happy. And with Jody. And I was, so I'm sorry for wanting to be happy. You should've thought about that before you fucked Jody. And because of that, you're gonna lose everything. - What? - What? Ashley, what's wrong, Ashley? What's the matter with you? It's fine, you're okay. I'm sure I saw it there, just behind you. Look, guys, we can't stay here. The only thing staying here does for us is death. The only way out of this is if we try and brave the forest. Yeah but Nick, we can't forget about Nick! He's probably still upstairs sleeping! I'll take care of him. You guys go ahead. I'll meet you at the main gate. No. I got us into this mess, and I'll get us out. I'll take care of Nick. Also, you're both faster than me so you could probably make it through faster. I'm not sure about that. Ash, he's right. We're all more vulnerable in here, we need to go. Bring him back to me. You owe me that. Let's go. Yeah, but wait a sec. What's up? Where are we going? We're surrounded by trees. We're going to leave the mansion and follow the road to the forest. It's not close, but it's our only chance. Yeah, but maybe we should face that thing. Are you crazy? We will die before we could touch it. We need to leave now. I'm not sure. Listen to me, you said we need to stay together. Leaving, we're doing the opposite. Yeah, well. Nick is up there, alone, and God knows what other dangers might come up. We have to come back inside and help him. If we don't go back, we'll regret it for the rest of our lives. Fine. I'm sure we'll all die in a very painful way, but I can't believe I'm saying this. We'll all be together. Nick? Nick! You want the book? I have an idea. Maybe there's something useful in there. Something we could use. Even if could, we don't have it. Didn't Mark leave it in the basement? There's no way I'm going down there. We have to. If we recover the diary, we have a chance. We have to find some way to protect ourselves. The last time we went to the basement I had to drag you out and now you want to go? To protect us, yeah. - Are you stupid? - No, I'm not. My grandfather knew something about this witch and he was able to get out. If I'm right, the answer to getting out lies in that book. She wrote a lot of notes in there. You saw it. - What if you're wrong? - What if I'm not? Oh my God. Go to hell, you piece of shit! Nick! Nick. Nick! Keep your eyes open, it must be around here. But do you think Nick and Mark are safe? I hope so, though I'm not so sure. Chris, we should go. Toughen up. - Please, let's go. - Toughen up. Run, run! Let's go! Ashley! Ash! Ashley, Ashley. Ashley, wake up. Come on, wake up. What happened? You okay? Yeah. I found it. The book? Yeah, it was on the floor, but then something hit me. Fuck! Let's go, let's move! This way, quick! Mark! No! Come on, jump, jump! Are you okay? I think so. Mark. Fuck, Mark, let's go! No. Chris! Where are you? We can't stop now. Ashley! Ash! Where are you? We can't stop! Ash, is that you? Chris? No! Hey, what are you doing with that knife? You wanna kill me? Nick, you don't remember anything? Anything about what? The witch. The mansion, everything that just happened. You were watching too much horror movies, maybe. Man, it's so late, I need to go to work. I'll clip this one. No. No. No. Miranda? Miranda? Miranda? Miranda, are you okay? Hi, this is Melanie, I'm not home. Please leave a message and I'll call you back later, bye. Hey, Mom, this is Eric. Listen, I know the last few years were painful ones, and I know you can't forget her. But I know you try, but she was my sister too, and I can't leave things the way they are. They didn't tell us the truth, Mom. I miss Ash. I'm calling to let you know I'm going to find out what really happened, Mom. I got a ticket for Italy, flying tomorrow. But don't worry, okay? I'll call as soon as I know more. Love you, Mom.
