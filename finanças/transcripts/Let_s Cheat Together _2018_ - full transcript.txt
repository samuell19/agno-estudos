Miss... Bastard! - Miss... - Bitch! Why don't you love me? Why don't you love me? Miss... Why are you like this, Hsu Hsu? Tell me! Hsu Hsu is calling for you. That's not Hsu Hsu's voice. Who is this? It's me. Come out. I can't. Where are you? I'm under you. Do you really know where Hsu Hsu is? Would you believe me if I told you? Where is he? The nightclub stamp on your hand looks like it was from last night. Your lipstick color is Armani... Your lipstick color is Armani rose pink 516. The stain on your chest is beer, not cocktail. You must have been hanging out with friends, You just wanted a relaxing Friday night, but you ran into Hsu Hsu with another woman at a nightclub. You had an argument... What the hell are you talking about? Hsu Hsu ran off with that bitch. You know nothing! You got dumped, right? I can help you. How can you help me? Take a good look. I'm Sleuth Cheng. Sleuth Cheng from Love is Magic. It's all your fault! Hsu Hsu scolded me for watching that stupid show. Forget about Hsu Hsu for now. Think about it. What would a normal person do in this situation? Your phone. Yes, pick up your phone. Do what a normal person would do. Yes, hurry up. Shit. I'm telling you to call the cops! What is love? Gangs are seeking revenges A philosopher Plato asked his teacher Socrates. Socrates told him to walk in a wheat field. Without turning back.

Will you respond? The spokesman will announce. Chapter 1: The Past - The Mystery Writer Yet another lustful scandal has erupted in politics. Early this morning, an Internet user uploaded an explosive video of Yenling Liao, the wife of the Mayor of Taipei, passionately kissing popular TV host Sleuth Cheng. The Taipei City Government says it cannot yet comment as it does not have all the facts. For a closer look, let's turn to our reporter at the scene, Apple. Five, four, three, two... Yes, Anchor. I am currently standing at Zhuojian Port. Sleuth Cheng, host of the variety TV show Love is Magic, was discovered this morning sealed in a concrete tetrapod. Based on my instant analysis, this is obvious retribution for an extramarital affair. Rescuers are now trying to free him. Let's see how he is feeling right now. Sleuth Cheng, how are you doing? What is the one thing you want to do right now? Stick my moustache back in place. Water... Thank you, Apple. The International Tetrapod Association's Taiwan branch lead researcher, Esteemed Hsiao, is here today to provide us with a deeper analysis. Hi, Mr. Hsiao. Hi to Anchor Chiu and members of the audience. Don't move! Is someone stuck in a tetrapod able to urinate? Don't move! He was doing just fine as Mayor of Taipei. He's too busy with working all day and night to be dragged into your stupid mess. Don't clean it off. It's all over the news. Might as well leave it for the show. Doctor, how's he doing? Is it serious? It shouldn't have been fully filled with concrete, so Mr. Cheng should only have some external injuries and is not in any serious danger. He's wrapped up like this and it's not serious? Shouldn't it have at least destroyed his nether regions? Didn't the culprit have any experience? The culprit was not an amateur and was probably an experienced pro. We can safely assume Mr. Cheng can pee in there. Can't we make it more serious? There's more reporters out there than a red carpet. We can't leave anyway. Might as well just cut it off and stay for a month. Hey, I'm already so badly hurt... Calm down, this is a hospital. I'm bleeding. I know this is a hospital. I can treat him right now. Even so, that should be my job. Will these reporters ever quit? If she tries again, remember to press the bell. Thirty minutes. If you can't convince me in 30 minutes, it's over between us! It's just... I pondered all night by the beach if I should use comprehensive analysis reasoning or deductive reasoning to explain myself. All I did was follow orders, but the Mayor now denies everything. What about the Mayor? Of all the cases I have encountered... this one's the most outrageous. Stop messing around! I'm not! Remember last month when we attended that wedding with the Mayor and Zen Master Dayu? They were ten weddings we went to last month. Which one? The one on the day we were meant to boost the image of our sponsor's CEO. He dated Ms. Jade Yen and staged a fake wedding a year ago to help Ms. Yen please her parents and receive their inheritance. After inheriting the money this year, Ms. Yen dumped Mr. Heir Wu for another. Who's right and who's wrong? It's up to you to decide. Let's take a look at their approval ratings. Now let's hear their witness testimonies. CEO Yen would never cheat on him. It's that Heir Chen who had an affair first! Sorry, his name is Heir Wu. - His surname is Wu? - Yes. Michael. If an expert driver meets a woman he can't steer, he will naturally go look for one he can. It's not that the passion went stale, it's that they had no feelings for each other. I don't mind being ignored or used as a tool. When I think about our future, all the sacrifices become worthwhile. It was thanks to your philandering that I have now found true love. There's no right or wrong in love, only love or no love. Don't let her change the subject. Go back to right or wrong. Acting holier-than-thou just makes her look evasive. Saying there's no right or wrong in love is saying there are no rules or truth. Without the truth, how can there be true love? To understand true love, one must first know right from wrong. As specified in the signed contract, the arrangement was: Sleep together Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays. Eat together on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays. Visit parents on Sundays. I worked seven days a week without a break, but I never complained. Why did I do it? Because my love for you is real. Real? You know how much money I spent to win you back? Go with it. Attack! Producer, please put up Ms. Yen's evidence. You spied on me? I wouldn't have if you didn't cheat. I admit it was initially about the money, but we truly fell in love later, didn't we? It's always about the money. Damn it! Is she retarded? Cut her off! Mr. Wu believes there is an undying love between them. But Ms. Yen doesn't think so. A relationship bought with money. Love dictated by a contract. Can love dictated by a contract be true love? May online jury decide now. The jury has found in favor of the accused, Ms. Yen. Ms. Yen has 60 seconds to decide whether to break up - or stay together. - Darling. I love you so, so much. I love you so much! I really love you so, so much! It's over for him. Prepare to wrap it up. Famous detective Furuhata Ninzaburo says there are three things in the world that can't be trusted. One, TV infomercials. Two, the glorious histories of retirees. Three, broken clocks at crime scenes. There are also three things in love that can't be trusted. Sweet talk from a horny man. Calendar-based contraceptive methods. Emotional performances when pleading to reconcile. Think you can go off script now that you're a hotshot? Don't think you can't be replaced. Or you want me to make a comeback? That's not how the script was written. Who's Furuhata? Who cares what he says? How are you going to repay me? I'm cutting back on sponsorship money! That was an Easter egg. An impromptu surprise for the audience. Easter egg? I'll stomp on your eggsack! Can't you shut the hell up? Don't get upset, Madam CEO. We got the result we wanted. You've gained the audience's approval. Madam CEO, have you seen your fan page? You have lots of new fans. All the comments are very positive. - Excuse us. - Really? We've got a wedding to attend. Bye! The specs have to be decent. Sleuth's schedule is very tight. Booking him a year in advance is standard. I know who Smiley is. She's very popular now. But our fees really can't go any lower. Have a think about it, okay? Is this Smiley, Taiwan's sweetheart? Yes, I don't care who she works with. 300,000 per episode? We're not beggars. I actually think NT$300,000 is okay. They're talking about RMB. Let's sit on it for now. What? Don't write if you don't want me to look. Can't you put more effort into the show? If our ratings can break 1%, no one will care if you talk about Sherlock or Detective Conan. Furuhata Ninzaburo? Then I might as well quit. Quit what? Wasting your time on some stupid mystery club. Buying a bunch of autographed novels. Limited editions, commemorative editions, European editions. Where do you get all that money from? How many times do I have to tell you? Tuck it in! Not now. I'm checking your moustache. I stuck it on properly. Hello... Hello. The Mayor's here again. Hello. To two of my most respected seniors and all our guests here tonight: Hello! Hello! I asked for us to be seated at this table so we won't be bothered for autographs and photos. We can have a proper meal. Today, I will talk about a new topic: 5 Rules for the Modern Man. I think the Mayor's wife looks really elegant and graceful. Fake. It's enough for tricking men. Ladies and gentlemen. Let's welcome Zen Master Dayu. Quick, stand to welcome the Zen Master. Let's welcome the Zen Master to his seat. Zen Master, please. Welcome. Get up. Thanks to the Zen Master for taking time out from his silent meditation to attend this wedding. I'm going to the bathroom. What a blessing for our newlyweds. Excuse me, I can't pee like this. Crown of the East. You've got the wrong person. You're the author of these two books. There's blue ink on your left index finger. You carry a notepad to jot down ideas. Sherlock's deerstalker symbol on your pocket square. You are a mystery writer. You're wearing a fake moustache even off camera. Your agent must be very strict. Your casual leather shoes are actually artificial leather sneakers. Your custom-fit suit cannot hide your fit physique. The tan lines and compressions by your sideburns are from wearing sunglasses in this week's record-setting heat. You have an earpiece in your left ear. The Mayor is doing grassroots campaigning for the election. You're his bodyguard. Completely correct. It's a good book. Why not use your real name? You'd easily sell tens of thousands. I'm selling a book, not a name. What did you say? I couldn't hear. I said I'm selling a book. Nothing else is for sale. You've got personality. Confidential Liu Confidential. Nice name. Speak to my agent if you want to collaborate. She can't know about this. Thanks, but I don't do paid appearances at banquets. I have a top secret mission. You're the only one who can know about it. Top secret? So mysterious. Is talking like this appropriate? What do you think of the Mayor? He can say "Hello" in dozens of languages. Tall, rich and handsome. The No.1 sexual fantasy of local moms. The mayor with the highest approval rating ever. Not bad. The Mayor wants me to convey to you his desire to work together. Work together? This is not the best place to talk about it. Let's discuss this someplace else. I won't take up too much of your time. Are... you done? Your shoelace is loose. Lucky Miu Miu didn't spot it. Mr. Liu. I can't be away for too long. Miu Miu will be looking for me. She won't be looking for you. Can't you tell this is a private carpark? So what if it's private? Everybody should recycle. Trash is bipartisan. Take whatever you can, slack off when you can. Tell this to your boss, not me. You've scored more than 100%. Welcome to the Dark Room. What is the Dark Room? Things that happen here cannot see the light of day. Put these clothes on. Leave all your belongings in the room. We can't take them in. Hurry, or Miu Miu will notice you're not there. You've got something on you. My phone. Please leave it in the room. I can't. What if Miu Miu calls me? The Dark Room is Asia's most secure private guest house. Nothing can be brought in here. Nothing that happens in here can get out either. We're just discussing a case. Isn't this overkill? What did you say? I took off my hearing aid. I can't hear. What did you say? We're just discussing a case! Isn't this overkill? I damaged my ear fighting in Afghanistan. Serious hearing loss. You're Afghan? Your Chinese is pretty fluent. Hi, how can I help you? Meal for two. Okay, please wait. Let's have something to eat. Can I try? Hi, how can I help you? I'm a little tired. Massage service? Yes, yes. What kind of masseuse would you like? Someone like Taiwan's sweetheart Smiley is good enough. Okay, please wait. - That's it? - That's it. - That's it? - That's it. Molecular gastronomy. Is that okay? Mr. Cheng. The City Government has a thorny issue we really need your help with. I don't know politics. I host a relationship program. Politics and love are essentially the same. Both are just clever trickery. Do you know the name Yenling Liao? Of course. Who wouldn't know the amiable wife of the Mayor? But what you probably don't know is that the Madam may be a serial adulterer. Are you saying the Madam is a sex addict? It's not apparent from the outside. Her identity also makes it hard to get a medical diagnosis. But whether the Madam is actually having affairs is something we can only speculate. Speculate? Don't you guys have a bunch of spies? All actions in politics have so-called "cut-off points." Take our meeting for example. If it becomes exposed in the future, the Mayor must have plausible deniability, understand? So the cut-off point of the Madam's apparent affairs is right here. We know the Madam has an alias account on an infidelity website. If she meets someone she gets along with, she'll invite him here like I did with you. What happens once they enter the Dark Room, we have absolutely no idea. So what does the Mayor want from me? The Mayor has quite an unusual request. He hopes you can have an affair with his wife. I didn't know the Mayor was so avant-garde. Excuse me, this is private. Could you please... You think I like listening to this? The reporters won't stop asking. I have to at least know what's going on so I can respond to them. This is a hospital. We're doing fine. Just say... Celebrities don't comment on their private life. That talk show host, Patty, keeps pressuring us through the hospital director to agree to appear on her show. That bitch. Get real. If there's an appearance it'll be on our own show. She's a famous media personality and the director's friend. I can't offend her, right? Or are you friends of mine as well? Miu. You're just going to let her threaten us? Not threaten us. Threaten you. You're saying French-kissing the Mayor's wife was an order from the Mayor? Stop making stuff up. If you can't make up a good story, you can go on Patty's show tonight by yourself. Everything I've said is true. You still don't believe me? True my ass. I've asked around. There is no Confidential Liu in the Mayor's security detail. Not even a person surnamed Liu. I've got his number on my cell phone. Where's your phone? I don't know. Probably stolen when I was being cemented. What a coincidence. The cut-off point taking effect. Haven't you noticed my career has been doing really well the past month? Including the raise we got from Brother Chan, all of it has been because of Confidential Liu's help. Ever since the Zen Master blessed you, your career has always been very smooth. Where's your energy gem? Shit! NT$500,000! It's hard to get! The Zen Master is not a miracle worker. Didn't you donate a lot of money before? Brother Chan still cut our pay anyway. And last week, we booked a military residence... I don't feel like discussing this now. The Mayor asked you to have an affair with his wife. Don't you think that sounds ridiculous? Not at all. When it comes to people in politics, you must think from their angle. This is between husband and wife. They should resolve this together. Can I speak to them? Not possible. They basically don't speak anymore. It's like the ruling party and the opposition party. Then why don't they break up? This marriage is already over. Why stay together? That's even more impossible. The election, four years ago, was looking very dire for us. But the Madam was struck by a bullet on the eve of the election, turning the tide in our favor. We ended up winning by 120,000 votes. So it's still about votes. Women account for half the vote. We can't displease our female voters. For the Mayor to be re-elected, all relevant risks must be contained. So you've got to keep the Madam happy, right? Seems you've got a good grasp of the task already. I have another question. Go ahead. Can I refuse? What if you change your mind and deny all involvement? I'd be screwed. That won't happen. As long as nothing happens before the election, we won't interfere. Remuneration? You make a new friend. Shit. I'm not doing this for my health. I've got enough friends. Crown of the East. Apart from money, I trust there are many other things you desire. Being my friend can be very convenient. If everything goes smoothly, you won't ever have to see me again. Smiley? For real? Men really cannot resist her. No. The point is that I felt having the Mayor as a friend would bring many benefits. It's your mystery novels, right? You felt accepting this mission would let you carry out a true secret operation and gain a lot of first-hand experience. Idiot. And then? And then I accepted the mission. But this task was actually not easy. I had to make Yenling Liao find me first. Exposed! Family secrets of Mayor's wife Yenling Liao supports Chinatrust Bros Elephants baseball club! Yenling Liao to attend season opener! Election shooting! If Yenling dies, I don't want to live News flash: Gunfire stuns election headquarters! Mayor's wife promotes reading discusses SoCal student experience Golden couple Taipei Mayor shares red bean cake with wife on Valentine's Yenling Foundation Mayor's wife brings dog into Cabinet to promote animal adoption Have a think about this. How could I use an alias dating account to attract a woman's attention in minimal time? Shit! So that's why you asked me that before. Why not switch on the light? Why not wear underwear? My underwear's not dry yet. Your fault for not doing the laundry last night. Sorry. I've got a question for you. I've got a semi-celebrity friend who recently fell in love with an internet celebrity. He only has her Instagram account. How can he get closer to her? Who is it? Shelton. Knowing thyself and thy opponent wins every battle. Don't express love in haste. Get to her heart first. Find out what she likes through the Internet and Line. Gradually get to know her. Most importantly, don't give up easily. Persist and fight to the end. Be the only man she sees whenever she turns around. Also, companionship is the longest-lasting love. No woman dislikes a protector by her side. But how is this carried out in practice? Basically, I knew about Yenling Liao emotional state, but she didn't know we were setting her up. So you had to create a coincidence and make her feel you were meant for each other, so she'd think it was destiny. All women fall for that shit. Confidential Liu gave me her account ID. Her alias is Nine Yin White Bone Claw, while my alias was Elephants Baseball Forever. Boring wedding ceremonies. Vulgar displays of wealth. Not a scent of love. "Hello"... The greeting alone takes ten minutes. I attended a wedding the other day. This sinful mix of money and politics won't have a good outcome. They even found some Zen Master to pray for them. Was this a wedding or a funeral? The air in this city is suffocatingly humid. I miss the fresh air of Southern California. Such a crappy baseball team dares to dream of championships. Never give up. Chinatrust Bros forever. I really miss that warm, flowing, sweet and sticky taste. Night market red bean pastry? Soon, I received Nine Yin White Bone Claw's Dark Room wristband and the code for entering the parking lot. I pretended I didn't know anything and headed to the Dark Room as invited. Private parking. Can't you read? Over my dead body. Sorry, I know. Hope I'm not too late. You mustn't be too late. I can speak, but you can't ask questions. Another Chapter: The Present - The Mayor's Wife We didn't exchange photos, but you don't seem very... surprised to see me. After seeing this place, I think nothing can surprise me anymore. Been here before? No. I just think it's strange. I have a bit of fame. Yet you don't recognize me. I know who you are. I've known since the second day you messaged me. The Internet is not a secure place. But since you're here, I'll be frank. My husband sent you. I must first praise you. Among so many perverts, you're one of the more diligent ones. You sent humorous messages and investigated me thoroughly. However, you were too smart for your own good. Stop baiting me. I didn't investigate you. My profile on the dating website is fake, but every word you wrote implied you knew I'm the Mayor's wife. I thought it was quite sweet, but didn't you think it was all too unnatural? So I got someone to check your IP records and found you didn't contact any other women on the dating website. So you were obviously targeting me. Impressive. If you'd been with my husband for as long as I have, you'd be this impressive too. I never thought Yenling Liao would be so cautious. I was dumbfounded. All beautiful women scheme, let alone those involved in politics. Yenling Liao is amazing. How'd you respond? I was completely unprepared, - so I decided to tell her the truth. - Okay. Honesty is always the best policy. Let me ask you. What lipstick was Yenling Liao wearing that day? Dior Rogue 999. Lipstick? What about her lipstick? He likes to notice these little details. You noticed, which means you hadn't lost rationality. And then? Keep going. I explained the whole Confidential Liu mission honestly to Yenling Liao, just like what I'm doing now. Now that your mission is exposed, how will you report back? Frankly, I didn't expect you to be this sharp. Before coming here, I thought I was rather... What? You know... How about this? Nice to meet you. An affair is very risky. What I need is a man who's totally honest with me. Thank you for coming. I hope you can keep your big mouth shut. No one will believe you anyway. Have I been rebuffed? You're still here? I got hungry on my way out. It's free meal, so I thought I might as well. Besides, you didn't tell me what message to pass on. Did I tell you to pass on a message? You told me to keep my big mouth shut. You already knew who I was. Logically speaking, you wouldn't have invited me here. Which means you wanted me to come. Go back and tell Confidential Liu that I'm not so clueless on the big picture. I chose to select men here because I don't want things to get ugly. Okay, I got it. Anything else? Let's have some fun. Seems your online claim about a foot fetish wasn't made up. The photos you posted online are all like porn to me. Let me tell you. I love a manicure. But the Mayor doesn't like it. He says an official's wife has to look the part. Look, so pretty. I've looked into all the info on you. I didn't know you had this skill. Every official's wife has a side people don't see. My turn. You're sucking up to me. I don't like baseball. It was the PR company's idea. I like water polo. Watching a bunch of hot guys pounding each other with balls. It's so exciting! Show me something else. Okay, next time. The nails took too long. I've got a gig later on. I better get going. Can't you cancel it? It's unethical to cancel at the last minute. What if... I could give you another way to make money? Would you... stay here longer? I knew that if I hung out with Yenling Liao, it would be easier to handle both her and the Mayor. It seemed like a disaster, but there were many hidden benefits. Only then did I realize how politics worked. So, I went to the Dark Room even more regularly. Did you enjoy it? Come on in. I can teach you how to swim. Aren't you afraid of water? Where did you put your hand? Is it done? Almost. All five, six, seven, eight fish roe are on your nipples. No wonder you smelt fishy for a while. Disgusting! Gradually, I realized that in the Dark Room, Yenling just wanted some company to help her relax. Or perhaps she really was lonely. Jin Yong's The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber has been adapted to TV seven times, but my favorite is the 1994 version, in particular Kathy Chow's portrayal of Zhou Zhirou. I also like Jin Yong. But my favorite writer is Ni Kuang. I know Ni Kuang. The one who writes sci-fi mystery novels. I thought, as the Love Master, you'd like Eileen Chang or writers like Chiung Yao. Let me tell you. I once won the Ni Kuang SF Award second prize. Really? The Ni Kuang SF Award... has a second prize? Yes. I still remember the day it was announced. Ni Kuang called me personally and gave me the prize. I was on such a high that day. Why did you stop writing to become a TV host? I wrote two books but they didn't sell. I then somehow fell into hosting a TV show. Tell me the book titles. I'll get the City Government to recommend it for children's reading. They've been long out of print. Being a celebrity is easier to make money. Everyone has relationship problems. All I have to do is talk shit. What about Miu Miu? Doesn't Miu Miu support your writing? It's not that she doesn't support it. She's just scared of being poor. We used to live off her lone salary, which was less than NT$30k a month. Our lifestyle got better but our expenditures got bigger. Now even NT$300k a month isn't enough. We fight so hard for our dreams, but we can never grasp any of them. Life is just a fruitless struggle. Earnest and I also ended up like this because of my own doing. Marriages of convenience are a Liao family tradition. But I happened to fall in love with a poor doctor. Dear friends, Let's face the darkness... After we got married, we couldn't bear the pressure from my family. My parents encouraged Earnest to enter politics to maintain our family's political and business contacts. Earnest was a doctor who knew nothing about politics. It took him a lot of effort to adjust. Release the shackles of ideological conflict. Please give me a chance. I shall make fairness and justice a reality! Win the election! We are family. Let's use love and embrace to take down that wall, and turn Taipei into the beginning of hope! A source of light! Win the election! Thank you all for braving the weather to support me. Thank you! Power of love! Light up Taipei! Mayor's wife got shot! Gunshot stuns Taipei on eve of the election Assassin misses target Earnest Yang, hits Yenling Liao All sides condemn violence Mayor's wife's life hangs in the balance. Mayor's wife pulls through Your head gets through, your body will get through Good fortune is destined for those who escape death. We never thought this bullet would turn the election. Earnest was elected Mayor. Mayor. Your wife is looking for you. Is she nuts? She's even calling you now? Tell her I'm busy. Too busy to even speak to me? Fine, I'll speak to you. But this is the Taipei City Government. Can't it wait until I get home? But you're never home. I want you to spend time with me. Even if it's just an hour a day. You don't miss me at all. You're just lonely, right? I'm not lonely. I'm here for my husband. My husband has disappeared. If you just want company, go to the Dark Room. You can be with anyone you want there. As long as it's not exposed, I won't care. Earnest Yang. Do you know what you're saying? Mayor, you have to attend the funeral of Councilor Kuo's father at 10:00 A.M. Is the funeral of a stranger more important than me? This affects whether the Taipei Sewage Plant reconstruction project can gain Councilor Kuo's support. Five hundred tons of sewage a day. Is that not important? Earnest Yang, get back here! Both my parents wanted me to tolerate it. They said Earnest is a promising political star whose limitless future will bring honor to our ancestors. I'm 38 years old. I've calculated it. If things go smoothly, it'll be another 20 years of putting up with this. But right now I can't even tolerate it for 20 days. How could I possibly stand it for 20 years? I think you chose the wrong person. What about you? What about me? Miu Miu. Do you truly love her? Is she the one? Can you give up everything, give up your dreams for her? Tell me, are all men the same? Coward. Sleuth Cheng. You're a coward. You don't have the courage to face yourself. You came in! See? I jump, you jump. You're drunk. Don't you feel anything for me? Calm down. You're just looking for an emotional outlet. Like a drowning person grabbing at anything to survive. I envy Miu Miu. No, I'm jealous of her. Jealous of me? Sleuth, that wasn't a job. It's a love story! You want to use that bitch to tell me you chose the wrong person? You regret giving up your writer's dream. It's all my fault you're in this condition, right? No, that's not what I meant. You slept with her, right? I didn't sleep with her. That day I just helped her bandage her cuts and took her home. How will you believe me? I really didn't. I'm not listening to this! Let him finish so you can get the full picture. If you knew the affair couldn't leave the Dark Room, then how did you end up at a restaurant? I was set up. That day, Yenling Liao said she wanted to introduce me to her financial circle friends. We met at a high-end Japanese restaurant. Excuse me. I must go to the toilet at 12:30 P.M. every day. It's already 12:35 P.M. Don't drip any pee on the floor! He's so unusual! Unlike other celebs, he really isn't good looking in person. My friends all really like you. You're wonderful. Madam, this isn't appropriate in a public venue. I want all my sisters to get to know you. They can be a great help to your career. This isn't the Dark Room. That's why it's more fun. I then lost consciousness. When I woke up, I was already in the tetrapod. So that's what happened. Things got real between you and that bitch. The Mayor found out and stuffed you in a tetrapod to warn you that his wife is off limits. No, the Madam used me. She wanted the Mayor to think we were out of control. She just wanted the Mayor to face her. What lipstick did she wear that day? You're in love with her. You're in love with her. I was confused. I didn't know she would be like that. I wasted ten years of my youth on you. I did all I could to package you into the Love Master, and you took advantage of it to cheat on me. You're not the idiot. I'm the idiot! What kind of tactic is this? Shut up! I built Gundam robot models with her because it was what we used to do. Since I became famous, we don't even have the time to buy toy models anymore. When we did the tango, I remembered how you had wanted to learn it. The moment Ni Kuang called is something I'll always remember because you were by my side. Inside the Dark Room, all I thought about was our happiest times together. I admit, I was a little confused when she hugged me. The only thing I remember is that I didn't want you to be mad or upset. Having been through all this, I realize you're the only one I love. An emotional performance when pleading to reconcile is one of the three things that cannot be trusted in love. If you truly cared about me as you say, you wouldn't have allowed this to happen in the first place! Go write your novels. You're not going after her? If she loves you, then no matter how fake your performance, she'll still think it's genuine. If she doesn't love you, even if you pour your heart out, she'll still think it's a ploy. It's not the time for this bullshit. Go chase after her. Apologize sincerely. She'll forgive you. Don't follow me. I don't want to hear your excuses. He didn't come. Shit, chasing after the girl is the most basic rule. Calm down first. Listening to his bullshit for two hours wasn't enough? It's not entirely Sleuth's fault. The whole thing was instigated by Yenling Liao. Nothing would've happened had he not agreed to seduce her. He deserved it! Since the incident, all Sleuth has done is try to explain things to you. He doesn't care about his own career or any future political threats he might receive. I don't think Sleuth betrayed you. You've been too busy arguing to remember: He was set up by Yenling Liao. Why are you defending him? No, I'm defending the Mayor. Your name is Doc Liu? Are you a real doctor? The Mayor used to be a doctor. He was my mentor. Miss Miu Miu. Handsome. Is this related to the Earnest Yang corruption scandal? Come here. Earnest Yang really is very popular. Despite the Sleuth Cheng scandal, the people are still on his side. Netizens have launched a manhunt for Sleuth Cheng. Let's see if there's any more news. Take a look at this. Netizens can sure dig things up. They even found love letters Sleuth wrote in junior high. Please head toward Da'an District. You've been here the whole time? Yes. I've been surveilling your conversation with Sleuth Cheng. Please sit. No need. I've been sitting all day. I don't want my ass to get fat. I don't care if it was Sleuth Cheng or whoever it was that told you. I don't care. Because none of it is 100% accurate. If you knew your wife was behind it, then why not resolve this with her face to face? I needed to know what her plan was so I can prescribe the right remedy. Strange. What does your marriage have to do with us? Hasn't our estrangement dragged your relationship down too? No one is an island. Everything is interrelated. It's called politics. Shit, you're still trying to talk your way out of it. Miss Miu Miu. You can also get fat legs from standing too long. Take a seat. I can't fit into it. Go in. Are you're in cahoots with the Madam? Are you okay? Hi, how can I help you? Please put on news coverage about me and the Madam. Early this morning, an Internet user uploaded an explosive video of Yenling Liao, the wife of the Mayor of Taipei, passionately kissing popular TV host Sleuth Cheng. This is the angle of the restaurant's surveillance camera. No need to deduce anything. I'm behind all of it. Why? I also informed the media. What about the tetrapod? Suggested by Confidential Liu. Why set me up? "What is love?" Philosopher Plato asked his teacher Socrates. Socrates told Plato to walk through a wheat field... I happened to see that part of your show. It gave me an idea. With your fame and image and my status, the media would have a field day. The Mayor would have no choice but to face me. Happened to see it? Why did you have to watch TV? It was I who wronged you, Sleuth. Sorry I hurt you, Sleuth. I promise I'll clear things up. But can't you leave the entertainment industry behind? Didn't you say that once you've made enough money you'll focus on being a mystery writer? Here's your chance, Sleuth. Isn't that great, Sleuth? Madam, Chairman Kao from the TV network wants to invite you on Patty's show. Her again? What a nuisance! He said the Mayor has already agreed to be on the show. Confidential Liu. When we first met, didn't you ask me what I desired? Yes. I want to go on Love is Magic. This whole misunderstanding must be cleared up on my show. So you knew nothing about the Dark Room. I just heard about it for the first time. So the assassination on the eve of the election... That was Yenling Liao's idea. Of course I knew it was cheating and it was putting her life at risk. But the mayorship was only a step away. I was just this one step away from changing the world. If I had lost, I wouldn't have been able to take it. So you agreed to it for victory. Yes. For the sake of victory, I too became the devil. What about Councilor Lo Kuan's hidden camera? The Lo Kuan scandal was intentionally exposed by himself through me. Once the news got out, his wife would lose face and ask him to move out and get a divorce. It was exactly what he wanted. So it wasn't used to cover up the medical scandal you were involved in? You're a disciple of Zen Master Dayu? Aren't you one too? Did you know that Zen Master Dayu is Yenling Liao's uncle? Zen Master Dayu is said to have two million disciples. They all represent votes. I indeed got into politics because of the Liao family. But the deeper I sank, the more I realized so-called "politics" is just a breeding ground for collusion between officials. Even our so-called democratic system is just an endless game of taking turns among themselves. So I decided to reform the system. I'm going to change everything. You're saying because you don't follow their rules, they're trying to eliminate you? I suspect it. No. I believe the medical scandal was fabricated by forces behind Yenling Liao. I looked into the former mayor's biotech park corruption case and discovered that the biggest beneficiaries were associates of the Liao family, and especially Yenling Liao's family. Do you love her? Of course. It's precisely because I love her that we're in today's mess. Does she love you? Face it, become it, let go of it, surpass it. Reading this calligraphy through a mirror feels quite philosophical. "It" refers to a monster, a demon. But "it" can also be you. You must first become a monster to kill a monster. Let go of the fear in your heart. Surpass yourself. A treacherous politician or a beautiful woman: Which is scarier? Do you regret meeting me? Miu Miu is also a disciple of Zen Master Dayu. Perhaps this was fate. Meeting you has made me realize just how important Miu Miu is to me. I'm jealous of her. I've said it before. Do you love the Mayor? Do you know how he became the Mayor? The first indigenous mayor, who also starred in the movie Seediq Bale. Everyone knows his story. That's just our packaged image. The show that's coming up will make him thoroughly give up politics. I love him. I want him back so he will only be mine. Was it worth it? You don't question if love is worth it. The kissing scandal between Yenling Liao and popular TV host Sleuth Cheng has a new development. After disappearing for the past 12 hours, the wife of the Taipei Mayor is striking back by appearing hand-in-hand with Sleuth Cheng on his show Love is Magic. Today should be very exciting. It's the first time a political figure is appearing on a TV show in place of an official press conference. The Mayor's phone is still switched off. He wouldn't really go on that show, right? The City Government still noted that it cannot get in touch with the Mayor. So are you willing to help the Mayor? How? Sleuth's success today is all because of you. Yenling Liao really put on a show this time, so only a show expert like you can resolve it. In my professional opinion as an agent, I believe... the Mayor should go on the show. I'm not going on the show. You have to. I'll say it again, I'm not going on the show. I was elected to get things done, not to be a performer. If you don't perform this time, you won't be able to get things done in the future either. The Final Chapter: Idle Gossip - The Mayor What is love? Forget about what Plato and Tiramisu said about love. Today, let's listen directly to what the Taipei Mayor and his wife think. Welcome to tonight's episode of Love is Magic. As our regular host, Sleuth Cheng, and the Taipei Mayor's wife, Yenling Liao, are having an affair, I mean, an alleged affair, I, Brother Zhan, will take over hosting duties today to uncover the truth for the public. First, I must thank the Mayor's wife for joining us. Madam. Usually in situations like this, an explanatory press conference is the way to go. Why did you choose a great show like Love is Magic instead? A month ago, I contacted Mr. Cheng to ask him the secret to a happy marriage. Mr. Cheng is very observant. He could tell right away that the Mayor and I were having serious problems. He's the Love Master. But... Madam, you're sitting in the accuser's seat today. So are you saying the Mayor is at fault? Okay. The Mayor is not here yet, so let's first look at the online approval ratings of both sides. Come. Yenling Liao Brother Zhan. You're going overboard. Can you let the Madam finish first? I'm the host of the show, you... Madam, please. A few days ago, Mr. Cheng asked me if I had any friends in financial circles. So I invited him for coffee with two friends. While heading to the bathroom, we ran into each other on the stairs. Mr. Cheng and I could not help ourselves in the moment. That's why the video footage exists. So you have feelings for each other? No. Plus the footage was too over the top. The Madam and I never kissed that many times. But it happened at least once, right? At least once, right? - Did it happen? - Not that many times. Not that many times but at least once? Not as many as you say. I didn't say a lot, just three times. - It's not that many. - Did you count? You counted? Yes, you're counting. It's not as many times as you say. If it's not that many then how many? You admitted it was at least once. Was it once? Yes, once. Once! So, at least once means more than once? If it's more than once then how many times? - You keep saying... - It was an accident. Mr. Cheng and I were set up. Madam, you're saying you kissed Sleuth Cheng due to a set-up? Then let me ask: Who set you up? The Mayor. Madam, that's a very serious accusation. This woman is insane. Why aren't any of you eating? This is too crazy. Ever since he was elected Mayor... This is outrageous. ...all he did was work every day. The people gained a good mayor, but I lost my good husband. I tried to communicate with him many times, and I admit I went a bit overboard this time, making him lose face. What's Sleuth looking at? But I never thought... he would start hurting me. He tied me up and cut the soles of my feet with glass. He wouldn't let me go out. I never expected someone I love so deeply would hurt me. He's changed. He only cares about votes, not me. I... I feel abandoned. Producer, shift the camera. I think there's an upskirt. He says I am the Mayor's wife. I must sacrifice for the people. Yes, I regard the people as my family, but I'm not able to see my real family. You wanted to see me, so here I am. Dad, the Mayor has arrived. Please welcome the Mayor! Thank you for coming. Okay, let's go to a commercial first. No commercials today, okay? Let's take this opportunity to report to the people of the nation. Why are you with the Mayor? Why are you with the Madam? Please take a seat. Take your time, talk things through. I'm sure the audience is super curious. Sitting with the Mayor in the witness box of the accused is Miss Miu Miu. She's the agent of our Love Master, Sleuth Cheng, and also his girlfriend. - I can reveal that? - You already did. - Right? - Okay. Mayor, let's cut to the chase. The Madam says the viral video was a set-up by you. She's twisting the truth. I don't know what her aim is. I just want my husband to come home. I have something to show everyone. I've looked into it. The restaurant where the video was shot belongs to the Liao family. So, I boldly surmise that the video was set up by you. No. My husband forced me. Madam, you're saying the Mayor forced you? - Can you explain this more clearly? - Wait... Members of the audience. Must a wife go to such extents just to see her own husband? It's unbearable! Is such a husband, such a mayor what we really want? Can the accuser's witness respect the court? Please control yourself. How many times are you going to say it? I only said it once! - How many times do you want to say it? - I can't even say it once? - Can't you shut up? - I can keep saying it! How many times are you going to say it? - Shut up! - Control yourself. Ms. Yenling Liao! If you really love your husband as much as you claim, then how could you make such an impulsive mistake? Actually, what everyone saw online was a doctored video. I have here the unedited video. This is what really happened. Ladies and gentlemen. We have now obtained the unedited version of the video. Assistant, hurry. Hand it to the Producer. Okay. Okay, thank you. Audience members we are now going directly to the unedited version of the scandalous video. Take a look! That's one kiss! Not yet! They kissed! That's a second kiss! They rolled behind the wall. Who knows how many more kisses? They've rolled back out. They haven't kissed enough yet. Kissing the neck and the ear. His poor technique isn't satisfying her. That's not me. - I had been knocked unconscious. - Unconscious? More like unconscionable! The video shows you forcing yourself on the Madam. No matter what Sleuth did to me, I am willing to forgive him. After all, this all started because of me. But it's also because of this that my husband has finally put aside work to see me. This whole experience has made me even more certain of my love for my husband. To protect our family, I am willing to make any sacrifice. No, no, no... It wasn't like this. Producer, play the video again. Look, everyone. Sleuth's shirt was untucked from the back. Think about it. When a man is eager to pounce, what would he typically do? Because when a man is horny, he'd normally undo his pants and pull out his shirt from the front. Not from the back, because it's too slow. Yes. So I think what really happened was that the Madam seduced Sleuth. That's right. But it's clear from the video that it was horny Sleuth who forcibly kissed the Madam. How many times do I have to say it? To protect my own marriage, I indirectly damaged your relationship. For that, I am sorry. Character assassination! She's sacrificing me to protect their image. Is what you told me before true or not? I don't know what her aim is. Was a set-up by you... To protect our family, I am willing to make any sacrifice. Snap out of it. Do you think you're Sherlock Holmes? What kind of expression is that? It's all your fault I ended up like this. None of this would've happened if I was a writer. When you saw your bank balance and fan base grow, you obviously liked it. You should appreciate my efforts. Efforts? Effort is needed to become a vulgar person like you? Want to break yourself? Idiot. No one can break themselves. Why are these words inversed in the mirror? Shouldn't this calligraphy appear normal in the mirror? Because the person in the mirror is you. I'm the real Sleuth Cheng. I'm in the mirror? Face yourself. Become yourself. Let go of yourself. Surpass yourself. Which hand is this? Left. Which hand is this? Right. I understand. Famous detective Furuhata Ninzaburo says there are three things in the world that can't be trusted. One, TV infomercials. Two, the glorious histories of retirees. Three, broken clocks at crime scenes. Producer, play the video again. How many times? How many times do you want to play it? Producer, please enlarge the mirror on the back wall. The time reflected in the mirror is 00:55, which is 12:55. But we all know images in mirrors are inversed. It looks like 55, but it isn't 55. Right! 22:00 is 10 P.M. When they went behind the wall, it was still 12:45 P.M. But when they came back around, it suddenly became 10 P.M. This shows that the video has been doctored and is not unedited as the Madam claims! Therefore, the one who later forcibly kissed the Madam was not me. Madam, it's a fake video. Is anything real anymore? Ladies and gentlemen. are you not entertained? Miu. The Madam does whatever it takes for love. I see shades of you in her. You bet your whole life on me. I don't have the Madam's huge... courage. To help the man she loves become the Mayor, she gambled with her life by intentionally taking a bullet. Are you saying the assassination was staged? Yes. The Mayor also really loves her. He checked repeatedly with the shooter because he feared for her life. So the Mayor was in on it too? Thunder! You're overdoing it. This isn't a show. Excuse me, this is precisely a show. Mayor, care to clarify? Has he fallen asleep? Ever since I became the Mayor, I've been on thin ice every day. I always carry the will of the people in my heart, never daring to forget it. I care for the people's well-being. I trust that a lot of people can see this. No matter how hard it gets, I have no regrets. There's one thing I know very well: If you have a goal, you must never give up. You don't need everybody's approval because the outcome is always more important than the process. I believe I have fulfilled most people's expectations. Conversely, I have become a stumbling block for some. I don't want to disappoint those who have supported me along the way. So right now, I shall take responsibility before the people, and immediately resign from my position as Mayor, and await the results of the investigation. Why did the Mayor resign? So strange. Honey, did you hear that? What happened? The Mayor resigned. Really? Mayor, are you acting for the camera or making an official announcement? Mayor, are you being serious? Thank you all for returning my husband to me. According to the latest update, the shooter of the Mayor has been identified as Sniper Sheng, age 24. He worked the late shift at a convenience store and had no political leanings. The killer clearly targeted and ended his own life after the murder. Supporters have formed a crowd outside the hospital, braving the rain to pray for Mayor Earnest Yang. At the same time, the election assassination case from four years ago is being reopened by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office. A press conference is being held at 1:00 P.M. today. Police Commissioner Heimy Tu is personally heading a special task force, promising to maintain social order and not ruling out the possibility of political motives behind the shooting. Yenling, it must be hard on you. It's not. Though Earnest Yang is now a vegetable, there is a chance as long as he is alive. You must take good care of this card. He may still be of use in the future. Sleuth Cheng won't be a problem, right? Master, don't worry. He's a scaredy-cat. He won't cause any trouble. Setting up Sleuth was a bold move. Every step was within your grasp. This strategy has proven your ability. This should change the Liao family's preference for boys over girls. Get someone to take the fall for the biotech park case. Go expose it after a little while. There's not much time before the mayoral election. Uncle. Shouldn't I aim higher than just Mayor? Police admit no progress in Mayor assassination case Building fire rages all night Mayor's wife to run for Taipei Mayor Sources The fire was more spectacular than the Taipei 101 fireworks. Cut-off point. You got my nipple. Oh, sorry. You love it. No wonder you had so much fun with that bitch Yenling Liao. So what do you think? Are you going to speak to the Prosecutor? Who knows which side the Prosecutor is on? I'm afraid they'll think we know too much. Besides, Yenling Liao hasn't contacted me. She probably doesn't want us to remember. Politics is so murky. A good mayor was taken out, just like that. What happened to that new job you told me about last time? I told them to delay it. Delay? To be honest, selling a few shares will allow you to write several novels. Write whatever you want. But think about the target market so I can sell the TV and film rights. What? Not happy? Say something. Tell me everything you want in one go. I think we should go back to doing shows. Writing is too lonely. Even the success is just for one person. But a show is different. Let's work together, strive together. I like having you by my side, encouraging each other. Hobbies and careers should be kept separate. I'll get the door. Stop playing with the breadstick. Put some clothes on! Hey. Doc Liu? Your boyfriend? If things had gone smoothly, you would have never seen me again. Leave me alone! It's already noon, so what you have isn't "morning wood." The fluid on your belly button is from your body. Messy dining table, stained clothes. That's where it just happened. The final position was from behind. If it's not a good time, we can wait outside. It's okay, wouldn't be a long wait anyway. Come in. Looks classier than last time. What do you want now? Bright Space wants to invite the two of you to join us. Bright what? Are you a wristband seller? Just who the hell are you? Take off the fake moustache. You asked me if I was in cahoots with the Madam. I was working undercover to spy on the Madam. The aim was to find out how the crime syndicate behind her operated. Also, my moustache is real. So the Madam also planned the Mayor's shooting? Yes and no. The Mayor went on the show to force them to make a move. But we didn't expect that they'd dare to shoot him in public. So who was the mastermind behind all this? Let it go. Zen Master Dayu? Bingo. What's the point of joining the Mayor's team? He's already turned into a vegetable. To help turn him over and cough out phlegm? You don't want me to run for mayor, do you? My undercover work also has a cut-off point. I chose the shooter. - Hello. - Doc. The Mayor is a former doctor. Everyone at the hospital is our friend. Let's be friends. Please tell your friends about the movie or watch it again! Shit, who turned out the lights? Confidential Liu. We probably shouldn't make our faces public.
