Let me tell you a story about a young man called Oliver. There's no singing, no dancing. Definitely no happy ending. But before we get to me, this all started with a thief called Tom Chitling. Hey you! Oi! Stop! Damn it! He's there! Oi! Stop! ♪ Here we go. ♪ ♪ Here we go. ♪ Come here! Where is it? Growing up it was just me and mum. We didn't have a lot. But we had our imagination. Where did you take us today, Oliver? It's a beach. And we had an ice cream. Hmm! Delicious. I took us... to the circus. Wow! Elephants. - Thanks, mum. - You're welcome. I'm gonna take a summary from better tomorrow. I can't wait. What do you see? A lady swimming. What else? What does all of this say? I don't understand, mum. Well... I see... escape. I see... a powerful woman leaving behind a life that wasn't meant for her. And all of the flowers, they are telling us why. Anyone ever told you you are a bit weird, mum? Has anyone ever told you you're a bit cheeky? We're going to space now, are we? Yeah. I thought we were supposed to be doing our dreams for the future. I don't get it. That's you. And that's me. And we're in a gallery. And we're looking at this painting of you and me, in a gallery, looking at this painting of you and me in a gallery, and it goes on and on and on... But nothing lasts forever. Then it was just me. Time to go, Oliver. I didn't know anyone else. Certainly, didn't belong with them. I was better off on my own. Oi! Wake up. Wake up, you little rat! Right, I've told you before, and I'm not an idiot. I'm not gonna tell you again. Don't you dare. Sod off, you little spranger. Stop sleeping in the gallery! People don't really call me Oliver anymore. They call me TWIST.

Come on man, we know that it's you. We done the forensics. Your spray cans. He is a joker, this one, but look, listen, I am Dodge this is Batesy and together we... What about your bike? Not ours, pal. Go! Come on. Stop! Wait! Come on. Let's go. Get down! Come on. Cracking set of pants, luv. What happened to him? Who is that? Brilliant. You two again. Oh come on, we are guardian angels. Where's the other guy? Come with us, we'll see what you got with some new gear. Or you could just stay here, I mean, it's up to you. We got trainers as well. Really? Come on, handsome, follow us. I ain't got anything worth stealing. Come on, mate. You can't go through life trusting no one. Yeah, we saved your ass once already. That was the other guy. What? You mean Red? Yeah. The guy in the green jacket. That's a real hero, that one. Entree s'il vous plait. Who's there? Just me and Batesy. What size of waist are you? I'd say about a thirty regular. Who's that? Oh, that is the ghost of Dodge's grandpa. Batesy, shut up. I'll introduce you later. - Let's get you some clothes first. - You do realize that I've got no money? It's alright. You can ask. I don't like owing people. Go on, have them. Introductory, special offer. - We can spare 'em. - Where did you get all this? - Sports warehouse. - I lost my favourite hat on that job. Are you ever gonna stop bragging on about that hat? Huh? Probably not. Have 'em. They cost us nothing. Shops claimed insurance... plus... them pasty legs, they're gonna give me nightmares. Better give them that, little bit of a shake actually. Let's give 'em a shake first, eh? Hey, Fagin. Dodge. I've told you before, you cannot bring in green kids off the street. - I know, but Fagin... - No buts. Out he goes. Fagin, please, this is Twist. Extreme graffiti artist, reaching places others can't reach. Texts on the moving crane, all that. You know like, what was his face... Banksy. Reaching places other people can't reach, eh? The problem with graffiti is... You can't move it. What's the point in a painting that's always in the same place? The higher up I put my work the more people can see it. That's the point. Doesn't belong to anybody. An idealist, eh? All property is theft. In my case, that's literally true. Tell me Mr Idealist, how's virtue treating you? Is it filling your stomach? Can it give you a hug on a cold night? Ideals are useless, they are like appendix. Cut 'em out. He's fast. He left the old Bill for dust. I thought maybe we could train him up, seeing as we have a vacancy. I'm not a thief. What, you never stole a Sony from Tesco's? I don't need to. They chuck out enough if you know where to look. Oh. Living the dream. We all have to start somewhere, don't we? It wasn't so long ago that you were stealing credit card details. - It's called phishing. - It's called surviving. It's what we do, to survive. I suppose. Bravo! You need a place to stay? No. Thank you. Cheers for the clothes. I'll pay you back. It's a really decent copy. I've seen the original tons of times, in the Tate. No, you haven't. I'll tell you what, I'll cook tonight, Dodge. What do you want? A spaghetti or a beef burger? - Oh, I love the spag... - Oh no, come on, do me a flavour, Fagin. You know, I'm 72 percent vegan. Meat is a treat. Doesn't matter what you eat, so long as you eat together. Because, as I've always have said the most important thing is the family that eats together - Stays together. - Stays together. Yeah. Right. Oi! Mate. I just wanted to... Sound of gulping like a fish? If you could speak sometimes, wouldn't that be great, cause I got somewhere to go... I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were... And I didn't recognize you with clothes on. I just wanted to say thanks. You're welcome. Is that everything? I'll take that as a yes. Oh.

I mean... I just... hoped... the way you move... Like a guy? Yeah, I get it. I don't mean to offend you. No, why would that offend me? Just, guys are more strong. Not that girls aren't strong, of course they are strong as well, just, guy tend to be... Not much of a straight talker, are we? Bestest climber I think. How come you are so good at climbing anyway? When I was younger, I was safer up high. People couldn't find me. So I taught myself to climb. And you've been a loner on the roofs ever since? Suits me just fine. You can't stay here forever. Without the things you wanna see, things you wanna experience. It's getting pretty boring. I can go anywhere I want. - What? - See. I can imagine. Well, I'm here, in real life. And I've come to invite you to a real life dinner. Me and you? Come to Fagin's, tonight at seven. And you never know, we might just be better company than your paintings. EAST LONDON THIEF TOM CHITLING FOUND DEAD What does Oliver say? Mum? Can't live by yourself forever. You are late. Is that any way to greet your favourite supplier? What happened to Tom? He screwed up, that's what happened. My kids, are not disposable. That's exactly what they are, my old friend. No friends, no family, no questions. For complications. Did you get my envelope? What? This? When has it ever been that easy, eh? I want in. I know you're pulling a job. You're hitting Losberne. I want a cut. - I was gonna tell you. - Of course you were. Let me make it easy for you. Whatever is in there... seems very important to your little man. Question is are we gonna do the easy or the hard way? Partners? Partners. Now, the envelope. I think I'll keep it. Just in case of future complication. Yeah. God, what took you a blunt... oh my giddy aunt! What is happening with your bun, eh? Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Come on, look, look. Welcome, Twist. Let me take your jeans shirt, jacket for you. Here we go. Come on. Glad you could make it, mate. Twist, come and sit next to me. Oh, allow me to... Nancy, you take these beautiful flowers and put them in some water. He can call me that. - You don't. - Understood. I am starving. Dodge, please. Fagin, can we just talk about something? Can we talk about our boy Batesy, stealing my food from under my bed. - Gross. - Thief. OK. We're all thieves. Yeah. Be a better one, that's the point. Alright, OK. OK. Twist, I want you to say a few words, because it's a tradition... about, how thankful you are. Well... Thanks for having me around for dinner, I suppose. I can't remember the last time that I sat down. Like a family? We are all orphans here. Alright, that's the thanks. Great, cool, can we bloody eat now? Yes! Eat, eat, eat! Let's go. It appears that you are a commissaire of beauty. Yeah. I saw you in my office admiring my collection, Mr Twist. Can I stop using that name? It makes me sound as I'm in a casino. What else can I call you? Oliver. Oliver, well, Oliver. Your artwork is impressive. - They are just copies. - No. Nothing is just a copy. We always put a little bit of soul into everything, don't you think? Yeah. I suppose. When I was at your age, I wanted to be an artist, just like you. But my father was... tasteless, a bully. I'm sorry. Why sorry? This is all my art and Nancy... is my masterpiece. She needs someone to train with. Someone who can keep up with her. So, you just do whatever you want? Yes, but together. We never work alone. We live together, we eat together... cause the family that eats together... stays together. I know. Alright. What's with all this? Got a little surprise for you. - For me? - Yeah. Come on, man. You ready? We are going out. Come on. Make sure you bring him back in one piece. Don't you guys ever feel bad? For what? No. Look, the people that we target are criminals anyway, so it's... justified. Ain't it? Think of Fagin as... good old Robin Hood, and we are his merry men. Oliver. Oliver. Hey, wake up. Come on. Get changed, we are going out. Can you give me a sec? - So, are you sticking around? - Yeah, I think I will. You sure you wanna do this? Yeah. It's nice to belong to something. Trust me, you'll be fine. Good morning, Doctor Losberne. Good morning. Doctor Crispin Losberne. Curator, art dealer, a connoisseur of 18th century painters. He is very predictable, which helps. He gets up every morning. And leaves for work at 8 o'clock sharp. He looks at his messages. And he puts his phone away in the right hand pocket of his coat. - Flat white. - Yes sir. Pays the barista. Then he drinks his coffee. What's all this about? We're gonna borrow his phone. And have it back in his pocket before he know its gone. - But why? - He took everything from me. Everything. And now I'm going to return the favor. First thing, we need to hack Losberne's phone. Oh, and as far as the day is concerned it's all performance art and the performance will be given by Nancy. I am such a cunt, let me help. I've got tissues in my bag, absolutely must, let me help. Oh God, it's all over your lovely jacket. I'm so stupid. I was just on my way to Royal Academy to the Gettysburg exhibition. - Really? - Oh, you've been? As a matter of fact, I curate it. Really? Oh, yes, come on. - Dodge, got it yet? - Yeah, target in. Alright. I'm quite a movement shaker in the art world. I have my own place. You have your own gallery? Is that working, Bates? You never need interns, do you? Never say never. - Come on, Batesy, hurry up. - I'll give you my card. I'm going as quick as I can. It's in my jacket? We need to speed this up. Yes, of course. Got wet. Hurry up, hurry up. Pop by anytime. Bye. Dodge, quick, he's leaving. Quickly. Yes, let's go. Garages on Swift Road. Someone's taken my phone. Oi! God! - Get out of my taxi. - Sorry, mate, I thought it was free. Is that what you're looking for? Yes. Thank you. You can keep the taxi. I am going to walk. Cheers. Where to go? Yeah, not bad for your first job, Oliver. Yeah, and that was just your turf. Batesy. Keep hacking. One word from Losberne, I wanna hear it. We need to know his every move. - Dodge? - Yeah. Do the washing up. - Oh. Man... - Nancy? You are going to art school. What? It's a crash course. If you are gonna be convincing as an art student for an evening or even for ten minutes you're gonna have to know some art to talk about. Oliver? Would you mind... Of course. Good. Nothing beats seeing it in the flesh. This is about Pope Nicholas. He's fuming. And Dante is... - Shit! - What? Do you realize this gallery is free, yeah? He's worked here for years. He hates me. He's always thrown me out for sleeping here. Get up. Here, I got you. He doesn't scare me. Shall we? Millais is a genius. The use of... Probably gonna win the 500 meter backstroke, doesn't she? Joking, I know it's Ophelia. Anything else you'd like to add? Well personally, I think the flowers in the painting are as important as Ophelia herself. The floating flowers, they represent her sorrow and the nettles growing around willow, that's the pain. Exactly. Did you do art school? No... just common sense. Ain't it? Well, that and the internet. Alright, let's see what else you got. So, do you feel ready to be the most convincing art student of all time? Yeah. Totally. Well, no thanks to my teacher. He was rubbish. Oi! So... Couldn't help but notice old Ophelia made quite an impression on you. Yeah. What was it about her? I used to go to that gallery with my mum. - She was an artist. - Right. That makes sense. - So, you did have a family? - Just a mum. She wasn't around for too long. Did you? Just a dad. He was around for too long. So why did you get into free running then? So, I could escape. Escape from what? From boys but Oliver Twist. Come here. To pull this job off, we'll need the plans for Losberne's gallery. Oh, not the cap and the Tash. - Hello. - Good morning, sir. We spoke on the telephone about your conversion of number thirty. The Losberne gallery. I have bought a building up aside. And I want you to make it modern like number thirty. Yes, I have the plans here. I can show you what we did for Dr Losberne. Follow me. Yes. Very nice, very nice. Da? 11:05 on the dock, Fagin. Just like you said. Where is the nearest train station? I've lost my wallet! How much does this sandwich cost? What time do you serve breakfast until? - What? This is David. It's OK. I don't understand Russian. So... You want my business? Certainly not. Take your time. Thank you. No windows, reinforced walls. That's the one. That'll be a job getting in. We don't have to do that. If we do what I've got planned, they bring it out. Batesy, carry on. Bring what out? This is the painting we're gonna steal. One of six paintings, by William Hogarth. That says Dotheboys auction house, Fagin. Why are we casing out Losberne? While the painting was lost in a fire many people believed it was a cover up for a theft. All this time it's been off the radar. So you're saying Losbern's got it. - He is the seller. - Wait. Hang on, a bit. How did he get his hands on it? Many years ago, Losberne went into partnership with a man called Isaac Solomon. Both of them, bought a lot of paintings, one of them... was the Hogarth. But when they had an auction... Losberne went missing... with the paintings. And Solomon had nothing and his credibility as an art dealer was gone. Later, Losberne said the paintings have been stolen. Solomon tells me. How long have you been here? I didn't know you're coming. You should be more careful, Fagin, you're getting sloppy in your old age. It's only you two. Oliver, there is someone I'd like you to meet. Oliver. Here boy. This is Bulls-eye. You're gonna need your hands later. Round two. Magnetic, see? Stick it on a pipe and get out. Oh, so sorry, is it a bad time? It's the perfect time. Thank you. - Bottoms up. - Oh. Cheers. So, you were saying I'd be answering the phones, staying late for the filing. Nothing a girl like you couldn't handle. I did actually want to show you some of my art. - Street art, you say? - Yes. Just on it. Let me just find them, yes. OK. - This one is actually based on... - William Blake. Of course. I love what you've done with the line there. - These are actually rather intriguing. - Don't gas me. - Come on girl. - Give her a second. Sorry that's my, graffiti talk, it's the only way to get taken seriously on the street. Alright. Don't forget your wine. It's just going straight through me. I must pop to little girls room. Is it downstairs or... Straight down the stairs, door right in front of you. Okay. Oh no, he's on the move. Fuck. - It blew my hand off. - Calm down. - Everything alright? - Yes. I will be up in a minute. You better have brought a spare. Alright. - We just gotta get it to her. - I'll take it. I'm the climber, right? Whatever you do, don't drop it. Red, it's me. Let me in. Oliver. Oh my God. What's going on down there? Losberne gallery. Special delivery. At this time of night? I'm right outside, mate, got a large package says ARTWORK'S FRAGILE. I could leave it on the doorstep if you want. No, no, no. I'm coming. I was just a little busy. One second. I'm at the window, where are you? Let me just check on that. Sorry mate, wrong number. I wouldn't use that lav... Bathroom for a bit. I'm sorry, you're going to have to wait here for a moment. Brittles? Can you come up here, please? What is this? Search her bag. Hey! Excuse me. If that's the way you treat all your interns, you can take your work experience and shove it up your ass. Our Dr Losberne is gonna get a surprise in the morning. Until then, you can take the night off. Go out, have some fun. Yeah, but wait a minute, not too much fun because you're back on duty - at 7 AM. - At Seven? Yeah. We all gotta be ready to move when they phone calls. And I'll stay tuned to Losberne. Well, you know, he might be into some heavy phone sex which means you might be up for a steamy night, oh boy. So, there is this party, what do you say? - Red? You coming? - She got plans. Mate, let's go. Come on. Awkward. Come on mate, don't be such... don't be dying on love. There are other birds in London. Come on, have a drink with us. No, I'm alright, mate. On your soul. - No, you want to... - Seriously, Batesy. I'm alright here. Alright. Alright. - Hey. - I said I'm... Oi! You mug. She belongs to Sikes. You think I don't know that? I don't belong to anyone. We'll see. Batesy, look out! I love coming here. You almost forget you're in the city. How'd you know about this place? Sikes brought me here once. Why'd you bring me here then? Because I wanted to. Is that OK? Seriously, why did you bring me here? Why wouldn't I bring you here? I don't think your girlfriend would be too happy if she knew. I never said she was my girlfriend. Why didn't you tell me? Tell you what? - That you are only into... - Girls? Never said that either. I'm so confused. ♪ Come and save our soul ♪ ♪ We know not what we do ♪ Oi!

There is the little bellend there. That's the one. - Stay with them, it will be okay. - Come on, son. - I'll get Fagin, go on. - Thank you. Alright. You know, personally I think it's an improvement. So let me go. Yeah, unfortunately, Metropolis Parking Solutions, that's the company whose property you vandalised, they don't quite share the same views. Little Ollie Twister. Look, to be honest, Oliver, a little bit of graffiti is not really what concerns me. You kinda run into Ward and Bumble, well that's just the kind of foot it is to miss like, a happy accident. What we really wanna talk to you about is... this man. Fagin. An alias obviously. Once, prestigious art dealer, then out of blue vanishes, disappears. Since then, it seems like he's been putting his knowledge of art to more practical usage. Apparently he's running quite the operation. Here. And what about this lovely lady? Known associate of Fagin, Sikes. How am I supposed to know these two? Nancy Lee. Alias Red. Known associate of both Sikes and Fagin's. That's a pretty girl, Oliver. I can get you out of this, you know. Get me out of what? Ah, see now that, that's exactly what I'm hoping you're gonna tell me. Cause your little friends, your little new pals, they are not all that they... seem. And to be perfectly honest, friends of Fagin and Sikes have a nasty habit of ending up... like that. Tom Chitling, he died last month. Take a good look, Oliver. I don't even know this Sikes. Are you sure? I'm sure. OK. Well. You are free to go. Just be careful who you trust cause people only see what they wanna see. Off you go then. You are late. Where's Twist? He's with you. Right, Dodge? Just wanted to get a running. It distracted time. I don't know where Twist is. Okay, we mow the night off. Those paintings are going nowhere till the morning. It is morning, where is he? Who is this? Think of me as the friendly uncle you never had. I just wanted to make sure you have got my number. In case you remember anything about Miss Sikes. I won't. You got some explaining to do, boy. Where have you been, then? I went to a pub with Dodge and Batesy. They got back here hours ago. What happened to you? I got arrested. We never linked words, are we? No, it wasn't like that. There was this traffic warden. I rode on his van, and he wasn’t happy about it. - You rode on his van last night? - No. Last week. I bumped into him this morning when I was... How come the cops let you go? - Did you give them something they wanted? - No. Nothing. I gave them nothing. If he gossed why would he come back here? Was I talking to you? - I'm just saying... - Don't. We need him. - Hello, Art Net. - Hello. It's Dr. Christopher Losberne. My vault is flooded so I need to move the paintings to Dotheboys. He's on the phone with the couriers. They are arranging a pick up. Round three. The paintings are gonna be on the move. This is it. You better pray this time it goes like clockwork. Remember. I'm watching. I'm claustrophobic, OK? Nobody told me that it was gonna be that small. Quit making a fuss and get in. I'm not making a fuss. I'm claustrophobic. It's an actual condition. If Batesy gets in there and passes out or something, the whole plan's screwed. - What are we gonna do? - Exactly, exactly. And there is every chance, if I get in there I will pass out. Batesy, don't be such a baby. So, what are you gonna do? Force him down? You say you gotta do something, you just don't do it. Are we gonna do this or are you gonna stand there arguing all day? What was in that? Alright. Anybody tries to move the crate, you set off the smoke bomb in their face. Piece of cake. Alright, that's it. Let's do it then. Really? Delivery to a gallery W1, yeah? Yeah, coming up, darling. Just got a few top off first. Alright, cheers lad. There weren't any sharing trouble with the national gallery cases? Yeah, let me see. Originally yours is dropped off first and then also national gallery. It's just an extra pick up, mate. It won't affect you, this one. Chiswell Fine arts. I've never heard of it. Have you ever heard of a Chiswell Fine Arts somewhere near here? I thought you knew all the galleries in London. I'll Google it. Can't find a Chiswell. Get me Art Net on the phone now. What's all of this? You out there, darling, what's the hold up. Can we get through or what? - How are you doing there, lads? - Yeah, fine. - Where are you from? - I'm from Fulham. Fulham? I've got some cousins in Fulham. Do you know Phil? - No. - You must know my second cousin. - What's her name? Oh, Tracy. - No. Can we get through? Can you get through? I mean... I don't know. 7-4 receiving, 7-4 receiving. 7-4 go ahead. Yeah, we just got a call from a Losberne gallery. They seem to think that we're being mobbed. Ah... everything alright, lads? Floor it! No! No! Sikes, no, Sikes! Please, Sikes. Run! Where is it? Give it to me. I didn't get it. I'm sorry. We need a distraction. Move. Move! That means don't go this way... Hey! Team, the suspect heading West town cross road. Officers are in pursuit, officers are in pursuit. I thought it might me very nice for you to stop. Really? Unit 7. Come in. Unit 7, anybody? I really need to start cardio. Yo partner, we got some good news and some bad news. Yeah, the bad news is I haven't got her. What's the good news? There is no good news, really. If I'm honest. Get yourself back here now. Oi. Get in. I need to work on my cardio. How come Twist was in the back of that van, it should have been you. Well, I'm claustrophobic. So we switched places. You shouldn't have. Batesy! LOOK WHAT YOUR FRIEND SIKES DID. He should have been back by now. Quite. I'm trying to think. That was our one shot. It's bad luck is all. Bad luck? There is no such thing, it was a simple plan, until that bloody Twist decided to go onto Van. Mate. Have you seen? What happened to Tom Chitling? He fell. - Did you see it? - Someone... has been misinforming you, Oliver. Don't avoid the question. I just don't think it's you asking the questions. Who you've been talking to? Sikes? Why don't you ask her? He's a rat. Van's suddenly peels off. They knew what was going down. - I didn't tell them anything. - Lie! What's this, eh? The thing I need to know, Twist is how you hold up into beating. How you fall to pieces, eh. Fagin, make it stop. Question is do you want some more? Hold him. Sikes, don't make it permanent. Right, Bull's-eye. On my command. You are making a mistake. A mistake? He got in trouble with the traffic warden. And how would you know that Red? Cause I was there. What? We were on our way home. And the traffic warden just came out of nowhere and tucked him to the ground just like he said. On your way out from where? Oh my God. We went for a swim together. If he moves, shoot him. Come with me! Bull's-eye, stay. This ain't like Batesy. He gets with jaw symptoms if he ain't plugged in. Batesy's dead. What? Just like she killed Tom. - But Sikes said... - Tom was murdered. He didn't go off that roof by accident. How would you know that? I've got text off that phone. Some cop gave it to me to see if I turn. And did you turn? Or were you never with this family to begin with? You call this a family? When that psycho is out there with Red and you are pointing a gun at me? I don't believe you, I'm gonna go find Batesy myself. You're gonna be looking six feet under. He's right. I pushed Tom. - You lying... - Please. Give me an excuse to kill you. You can't kill all of us. Let's see. Shall we? Six bullets, 3 kids, you do the math. We're hitting Dotheboys. We're getting that painting. Dotheboys? I think the whole plan was to get the painting before it went there. That place is impenetrable. You scared, old man? I'll have a plan in four hours. Try not to kill any more of them in the meantime. I can't promise anything. Look, mate... I believe you. What Sikes did to Tom, that's messed up. If we don't do this we'll lose Red too. Sikes is a loose canon. Let's just suck up and be over, yeah? Let's do this. - Is he on time? - Like clockwork. We're on. Oh, hi there, mate, sorry to interrupt. - Can I get a bakewell tart please? - Sure. - It's cheap, ain't it? - Yeah nice, like you said. There you go, one fifty. There you go, keep the change. Thank you, have a good day lads. See ya. The painting will be under lock and key before the auction. So, our only chance is during the main event. We go in, like a fan and in the right moment execute the plan sending the painting your way. Let's play happy families, eh? Big smiles. Thank you. It's the chair. Really? Dodge, once you are inside, let Twist in. Then when all hell is broken loose you know what to do. I think all are here. Don't do anything stupid. I'm glad you're finally taking this threat seriously, officer. Detective inspector. How many men have you deployed? Twelve inside the building. Another twenty outside. Nobody's getting this painting, Losberne. Dr Losberne. Better you than me, mate. Lot 1-4-6. William Hogarth's painting. 'A Harlot's Progress', 'The Arrest'. Oil on canvas, 1731.

Brownlow, you are wrong about Twist, he's in the lift shaft. Yeah, the dirty swine. Well, move then! I'm coming for you, Twist. Oh no!

Don't even think about it. - Come on, let's go. Do not move. - Hello? - Hello, mate. Your delivery is here. What do you mean? I didn't order anything. - Hey! Don't! - Let's go! Let's go! Hey! Hey! Get off the way! - Come back here! - They're getting away! Come back! Get off my way! Stop! Stop! You bastard! There is only one person who could do this. Batesy. Enjoyed your munch, did ya? You magnificent bastard, you had us worried sick, mate. Where are you? Well, you know, Sikes has gone full blown psycho, don't ya? - She tried to kill me. - What? We are on our way to see her now. No, don't. It ain't safe. What do you mean? We got no choice. Red's with her. We're all heading to Fagin's. Alright, I will meet you there. Just look after yourself. Okay. That was Batesy, he's... Twist? Twist? You're late. Where is he? I don't know, we got split up. - He's got it? - Yes. Oi! - You missed me? - Bates. Are you alright? What happened? I thought I've dealt with you for fuck sake. - Where is Twist? - I'm right here. You want the painting, she's coming with me. Do you think she's worth it? Try me. Do what he says. You got more stones than I gave you credit for. Give me that! I'll always be a step ahead of ya. You think you could just take my girl? It's the painting Sikes. Give me the envelope and let him go. You sure that's it, Fagin? - What? - The painting. Are you sure it's the right one? Easy. Easy. Just reaching for my phone. You guys might wanna see this. You see, before I got into Graffiti... I used to paint. Well, your lot mentioning Hogarth got me inspired. It's not bad, eh, Fagin? Where is it? I walk out of here with Red. I call you and tell you where it is. She stays with me. We need the painting, Sikes. Whose side are you on? All this, has got to stop. You're done. We're done. All bets are off. Get me the envelope. And I'll let you leave. Come on. You let me leave? I choose how this ends. - Hey! - Fagin, Fagin. Fagin! Come on! Quick! Come on, Twist! Come on! You go first. I'm not going without you. Listen, jump, I will be right behind you. Go. Twist! Twist! Hold on. Come on, come on! Twist! Hold on! Don't let go. Come on! No! No! Pull him upside. I'm sure he will be alright. Step back. The kid is not even strong enough to pull himself up? If he's so weak... He is not weak. You need to come with me. I don't need you anymore, Sikes. You think Twist will love you. He is more than you'll ever be... Sikes! What a fine thing... capital punishment is. ONE WEEK LATER Young man. I'm guessing you heard about the reward. Be there in five. Do we know what we're meant to be waiting for? We don't have a clue, Bedwin. I'm sure no one we see here. He's not exactly just gonna stroll in. Is he? He's literally just strolled in. Alright lads. You hungry? You got a lot of nerves showing up here, kid. - Let's just nick him now. - Calm down, Bedwin. You like two baked sunny? This might be very funny to you but it's serious. I need your full co-operation. Whoa, whoa. Co-operation? I have done you guys a favor. How's that? Where is the painting? - I don't have it. - So, where is it? I'm not the criminal here, in fact... I've done the work for you guys. - Two baked Sunny's. Enjoy. - Thanks. Excuse me I didn't order this. No, it's fine. It's my treat. Well that's very kind of you, young man. Yes, very kind. But don't think this is getting you out of trouble. I need you to understand one thing. You gonna need to start co-operating. Ah, brilliant. Yeah, hello, yeah, very smart, that was. A wise cop once said to me: people only see what they wanna see. You'd be wanting some brown sauce with those, I assume. What do you mean brown... Hello? Hello? Brown sauce. It's above the brown sauce, Bedwin, it's above the brown sauce. Holy shit. The tale of the stolen Hogarth in an audacious way took a bizarre twist today when a tip off led detectives to a lockup in East London. In which a large collection of stolen artworks has been discovered. The lockup belonged to the art dealer Dr Crispin Losberne. Documents that were also found proving that Dr Crispin Losberne is not the legal owner of the Hogarth. It's alleged that the well established art dealer has been making his fortune out off selling stolen artwork and faking the ownership documentation. A Mr Issac Solomon has been named as an accomplice is believed that this man also goes by the name of Fagin. Fagin and Sikes really had raised some good thieves. So good, that they didn't know when they were the target. The envelope revealed the true owners of Hogarth. And the key to the lockup where Losberne kept his stolen paintings. Holy shit! Even Bedwin and Brownlow deserved the break. In other arts related news, a mystery painting arrived with a special delivery for a new exhibition at the National Gallery last week. The question everyone asking is how did it get there. The painting was added to the exhibition by mistake but critics have gone wild for this unknown artist, demanded the piece remains on display. There you go, mum. In fact people can't stop talking about the mystery artist with many asking who is Molly Twist and when and where will more of her work appear. Dealers are said to be willing to offer up to fifty thousand to anyone with an original Twist antique. Cheers, Nancy. Call me that again, Oliver, and I will twist something you don't like. Quit canoodling. So... you are gonna stick with us, kid? Come on, you know you wanna... Look, if I'm gonna be staying around we gotta cut out all the nonsense and go straight. Whoa, hey, he's joking right? That must be a joke. What exactly do you expect us lot to do for a job, eh? You ever thought about selling paintings? A bag full of Molly Twist now is worth a few quid. Like I said, no singing, no dancing. But maybe I was wrong about the happy ending. I know these people. I belong with them. Transcript by Clarity Corrections by sub.Trader
