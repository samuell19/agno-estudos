You see, it's a moment of... You know, every time we look back on this moment when we signed this agreement, which severed Singapore from Malaysia, it will be a moment of anguish. I mean, for me, it is a moment of anguish because all my life... This is a defining moment in the history of Singapore when we were out of Malaysia. Older Singaporeans have lived through this time. For me, it is more than a historical moment. You see, I was there. This is not the war memorial. I am not old enough to experience the war. It is for us to remember a different kind of war. An undeclared war. I came early for the service to honor those who fought this war with me. Some are long gone. Some, like me, live to tell our stories. My story began when I met this Chinese man who did not trust me because I was Malay. But who would become a friend, for life. - Independence! - Independence! - Independence! - Independence! - I, Lee Kuan Yew, - Independence! - Prime Minister of Singapore - Independence! - do hereby proclaim and declare - Independence! - on behalf of the people - Independence! - of Singapore that as of today, - Independence! - the 16th of September 1963, - Independence! - Singapore shall forever - Independence! - be a part of the sovereign democratic - Independence! - and independent State of Malaysia. - Independence! ONWARD MALAYSIA INDEPENDENCE INDEPENDENCE If you're a fan of Chinese opera in the Cantonese style, come and see! I believe that you're familiar with The Eight Deities Birthday Greetings. Because all the Chinese opera out there performs The Eight Deities Birthday Greetings every day. - Come, choose what you like! - What kind of performance? It is a comedy... It was a different time. We were from different places. Spoke different languages. But we could, somehow, get along. Until suddenly we realized, we spoke little and understood even less of each other's language, let alone our race and where we came from. There was distrust among the races. And this distrust would be exploited. Xiao Yun! Dad! What are you doing? The clothes are dropping! I just washed them, stop! Dad! - You drew something? - Yes! So what did you draw? That's you. That's me? Who is this ugly girl then? Dad! Mom, Dad is bullying me! Who is bullying you? Who is bullying you? I'm going to work now. Wait, show me a magic trick first. - A magic trick? - Yes. Let's see what I have... This is no ordinary coin. It's a lucky coin. It can keep you safe. Thank you, Dad. Can I leave for work then? Don't go! The inspector provided for his family beyond what was expected of a man living in a time of turmoil. There was warmth and a sense of security in his household. He was a cheerful and righteous man with enough street smarts to work his way up in the police force. I learned English late in life. My mother taught me unconditional love. I was born after the Japanese Occupation. The eldest in a Malay family of four children. I was too young to remember the time my father left and when she remarried. She lived for all of us, - especially my youngest brother. - Thank you. Mom, I'm hot. Hot? You poor thing. It took a while for him to speak. - You're sweating. Yes. - And when he did, my mother was forever grateful that her son was given a second chance. I have some more! Here! We want fairness and equality! - The Chinese were vocal. - We want fairness and equality! Especially those with some education. The inspector made sacrifices so that his younger brother - could complete his education. - We want fairness and equality! Being educated, he carried himself with confidence. Although it belied a fear which could easily spark rage and even violence. He was an angry man with an angrier agenda. Thank you. - Fairness! Equality! - Fairness! Equality! It's not possible. How are we to survive if we separate from Malaysia? Lee Kuan Yew spent so much effort getting us into Malaysia, we won't be kicked out so easily. Zhou Jun, bring the two cups of coffee to the customers. The table in front. Two coffees. Separate or stay? Want to bet? You Chinese, everything is a gamble. Girl, what do you think? I don't know politics. - How much? - Thirty cents. Everything's gone up in price. - Even coffee is so expensive. - That's right. Pay up. You lost the last game. - Fine, I'll pay. - Right, pay. Thank you. - You're leaving already? - Yes. Your "bodyguard" is here. Don't spout nonsense. See you at the hospital next week. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Why are you here? I'm busy. I missed you, so here I am. You and your nonsense. What are you up to this time? We want fairness and equality. Just a peaceful demonstration. Don't worry. We won't do anything stupid. Just be careful. Are you showing concern? I... - I need to work. - Hold on! I've told you I'm not a child. I know, you're an adult. You have to take care of this shop and your dad. Who will take care of you then? Take it. Thank you. Remember to open it! - Morning, sir! - Morning. How did you come to work just now? - Good morning. - Good morning. Morning, sir! Morning. I have a lot to do. Morning, sir. Up to mischief last night? Yes, sir. - What? - No. No, sir. You are Chinese. You're lazier than them. They'll look down on you, have some pride. Clean up the mess! Hey! This is a police station. Clear all this rubbish. What is this? - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Hurry and clean up. - Morning, sir. - Morning. - Has he been caught? - We're trying our best. We'll find him soon. Give us a bit more time. How much longer? Soon. Goh, don't keep saying "soon." How much longer? Half a year? One year? We received some information. There may be trouble at Geylang Serai. What trouble? Should we send some men down? It has been barely two months and something's happening again? Send a few men down to have a look. Okay. Morning, sir. I'm the trainee constable, Adi. Reporting for duty, sir! New guy, it's his first day. Report to the duty office over there. It's your first day, be patient. You'll understand later. Go find the duty officer. Dad! Two coffees! Sir, my coffee is not sweet. Can you make it a bit sweeter? I am well known for my coffee! Do you know how to enjoy coffee? Miss, what is he saying? Sorry, sir. I'll add more sugar. Dad, he's our customer. Let him have what he wants. He criticized my coffee and said it's not sweet enough. My coffee is the best in Chinatown! He's not criticizing your coffee. He just likes it sweeter. I think we should learn some Malay to communicate better with them. You want me to learn their language? Why don't they learn ours instead? Dad, if our customer is happy, business will be good. With good business, we can make more money and go back to China. Isn't that what you've always said? We're running low on coffee powder. I'll go and buy some later. Dad, two coffees! I know. Watch it! Yes, boss. It's me. - You all right, ma'am? - Yes. Yes, the curfew has been lifted. The tension in the streets is still mounting. The majority are still very concerned. It is quite obvious the Malays and Chinese are still not getting along. Hello? Hello, boss? Thank you. The third started almost like any other September morning Although at the back of our minds, after the events in July, we knew anything could happen. But none of us were prepared for the impact it would have on all our lives. Sir! - I'm very sorry, are you okay? - Thank you. Let me help you up. - I didn't do it! - You're the one who did it! - Are you kidding me? - You did it! - You have to pay for it! - Darn you! - You killed him! - How dare you! Zhou Jun, have you eaten yet? I have, Mr. Tan. Mom, can I play with them? All right, but don't go too far. I'll take these 4 for 20 cents. They aren't ripe. Is that all? This one. Do you have it in gray? Yes. Are there any other colors? Yes, there are. Watch it! - Can't you see where you're going? - You can go over there. - Over there! - Where? Watch where you are going! - Didn't you see me? - So what? I was going that way! Stupid? I'm going this way! What? I don't know. Xiao Yun! - Don't you dare deny! - Are you kidding? You did it! - It's your fault! - Isn't it your fault? - I'm not scared of you! - It's your doing! There are people fighting! Come! What? Run? - Calm down. - Don't fight! - Stop it! - Calm down. A fight? Xiao Yun! Mother! - Xiao Yun! Mother! - You... Sir, there's a problem. - Hurry, run. - Run! - Run! - What's going on? - Run! - Guys, run. - Run! - What's happening? - Faster! - Run! We just got the news. The Malays are attacking the Chinese. Our people are being attacked by them. We cannot let this happen again. What are you waiting for? Come! Let's go! You stay here. But sir... Let's go! Right turn! Forward, march! - Mother! Xiao Yun! - Run! - Faster! Run! - Mother! Xiao Yun! What are you doing? Let go! Go away! Let go of me! What's happening? Run! Grandma, let's hide there! Rafi. Where's my son, Rafi? Have you seen my son, Rafi? I'm scared. Let's go! - Let's go! Hurry! - Run! - Let's go! - Hurry! Dad! - Help, please help! - Come in! Come in quick! Ignore him! - Let me in! - Dad! His head is bleeding. Zhou Jun, we have too many customers here. And your Malay customers are here too. Why help a Malay you don't know? It's too dangerous! Don't take my things! My things! Run! Have you seen my son, Rafi? Help them! Let's go! - Help them! - Let's go! Go away! It is not safe here. Let me take you somewhere safer. Please! Help! Let me in! Help! Help me! Help! Let me in! Help me! That door's open! There! Over there! What are you doing? You cannot come in! Help me stop them! Don't let them come in! You cannot come in! Go away! Go away! You cannot come in! That belongs to us! Go! Go away! Mother! Xiao Yun! Mom! Xiao Yun! Mother, are you all right? Let's go! Goh, disperse the crowd. Forward! Forward! Go! Forward! Attack them! Move! Attack them! Move! Rafi! What are you doing? Rafi! Rafi! - Attack them! Move! - Rafi! Rafi! Move! Rafi! My son! Please! Help! Sir! Save my son! Sir, help! Help! My son! Hurry! Do it! Help! My son! Please! Sir! Ah Chan! Goh! Please! Save my son! - Mom! - Rafi. - Over there! - Sir! No, sir! Don't go! Wang Zhou Ma'am. Ma'am. Where's Mom? In her room. Both Xiao Yun and her were caught in the riot. Good thing an Indian man saved them. An Indian man? Cheng. Mei. Xiao Yun? What's wrong? Want to see some magic? Thank you, Uncle. Good girl. Xiao Yun. You shouldn't eat sweets at night. Beware of the people out there. Don't go running about, understand? There's going to be a curfew in place. We should stock up on food supplies. Don't go out unnecessarily. Mei, don't talk to the Malays even if they are our neighbors. Come, let's go to bed. Cheng, the Malays are really too much. What's wrong? Where did you go today? Out with my friends. What friends? Those friends of yours? What exactly were you doing? The police are catching the troublemakers. They started it. I was merely protecting our people. What about you? What have you done? You want to kill? Or to be killed? Do you want me to arrest you myself? If you have the guts, go ahead. Come on, arrest me. What happened to your face? None of your business. Where are you going? To bed. Cheng, no matter what happens, as long as the six of us are together, we can get through anything. Since when were there six of us? You're pregnant? We have to live with each other in Malaysia. Do not do anything that will make it more difficult for us to live with each other. The more foolish things that are said and done in the next few days, the weaker and more vulnerable we will be. The rights and wrongs of each individual action or injury are irrelevant at the moment. When the order is restored and things return to normal, everything will be properly investigated and resolved. But at this moment, whoever chants communal slogans or incites others to communal attacks must be responsible for the senseless brutality and murder of innocent victims that have already taken place. We must stop them from doing more harm. Any questions? WELCOME PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW Raj? Hi, Sue. It's just a scratch. Don't worry, I was lucky. How long has it been? The heat in this country tends to fog my memory. So what brings you to this tropical corner of the world? My husband couldn't resist the clarion call of politics. So you are married? Too long. We just had triplets. The cow in my wife's village just gave birth. I see. Well, congratulations. Are you working for one of the political parties? Heaven's, no. I'm actually a reporter. Still being the voice of the people. A voice barely heard above the war chants of racial hatred. You were at the riot? I just wrote an article. What's the story? Who is responsible? Some extremist parties are not thrilled with the prime minister's idea of a Malaysia for all Malaysians. You should ask the prime minister. I am. I'm doing a piece on him. Interesting. Have you met him? At a cocktail once. He's a man of formidable intellect. A man with cunning, you mean. A man with convictions. Some people say he has ambition. Some people say he has a vision. A Malaysian Malaysia? A nation where every citizen has equal rights, whether he's Chinese or Malay or Indian. Sounds like a slogan. Defining a vision. Wrapped in an agenda, no doubt. When did you become a cynic? Scratch a cynic, find a realist. The prime minister is simply thinking of the future good a Malaysian Malaysia will bring to all of its people. I suppose, good luck trying to push that boulder up the hill of the Malaysian Parliament. He can. And he will. When he fully understands the way that people think and work. Yes. And who told you that? The tunku? My driver. Yong Xing - Zhou Jun. - Yes? Forget it. I think it's time for us to go back to China. Why? We just need to tidy up and with my friends' help, we can resume business tomorrow. After all that has happened, how can we still go on? But Dad... Just put the things here. It took so much for us to get here, and we've put in so much effort. Our regulars love your coffee too. Isn't it a waste to just give up? Right? Dad. These are for you. Let me know if you need help. Thank you. Wang Zhou Seng. Can you help me hang this up? Wang Zhou What the bloody hell is going on here? - Cheng? - Sir. What's going on in my district? - I thought you were back in England. - So did I. And whilst I was gone, you thought you could jolly well set up your own little fiefdom. My what, Sir? The best-laid plans of mice and men, Cheng? Mice? - What mice? - Rats. Rats, Cheng. There are no rats here, sir. We've cleared everything already. Apparently not all the rubbish. Headquarters canceled my flight and told me to come back and clean up your bloody mess. Sir, everything is under control. Control? There has been another riot. There are 13 dead and nearly 100 injured. What's this I hear about Chinese triads joining the fray? Sir, I think... Arrest all curfew breakers, Inspector Cheng. That's what we are doing. Any secret society gangsters, triads hiding illegal weapons, I don't care if they're Chinese, Malay, or Indian. Arrest all of them. Yes, sir. And what's this? Planning an early Lunar New Year's celebration, Cheng? We found these at the riot, in a shophouse. Remember the bomb? Happened in the hotel last year? - Cheng. - Another bomb may explode soon. - Maybe more attacks. - Cheng. Leave these matters to Special Branch. And before you start pulling conspiracy theories out of your hat, remember your position. My position? At this station. Doesn't necessarily depend on how well you play Sherlock. What lock? "Sure-Lock"? I do not want a repeat of my last order. - Arrest all curfew breakers. - All curfew breakers. Don't forget this one. Hello. I want to check something with you. Zhou Jun. Why are you sending so little back? We always send 30 dollars back. Yes, but Chinese New Year is coming. We should send more money back. You think we're having it hard here? They're having it worse. Your grandma left your sister in China so that we remember to send more money back. I know. I know you're very sensible. I wouldn't be able to handle the shop without you. But when I am no longer around anymore, who's going to take care of you? That young man? After a few months, kampong life was peaceful again. There was something in the air as villagers prepared for Chinese New Year. Soon, we would discover it was not something festive. And it would take a life of its own. These Chinese, the only thing straight about them is their hair. You can't trust any of them. You should go back to Johor with me. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - Peace be upon you too. Mom. Adi, talk some sense to your mom. What have you been telling my mom? You know she isn't feeling well. I've said it before. Khatijah, you know, right? It's not good to be a widow for so long. Especially here, look around you. The Chinese are everywhere. They are everywhere you turn. But in Johor, our people outnumber them. The Chinese won't dare to raise trouble there. Aunt. We've been living here for years. They have not caused us any trouble. You are a small kid, what do you know? Adi. Good morning. We know it may not be inconvenient for you. We've brought you some food in case you don't have enough. Many shops will be closed. Why are you being so nice? What is she saying? We're just being concerned! Mom? I am a proper constable now. Look here. I took this photo with everyone in the station. Have a look, Mom. Adi, which one are you? I'm here. You're right. This man. I asked for his help, but he walked away from Rafi. What did you say, Mom? He was the one who left your brother to die. This man. Who is he? Who is this Chinese policeman? - Khatijah. - Who is he? This is Inspector Cheng, Mom. He is my boss. My goodness! Why are you working for him? Xiao Yun is a coward! No, you are! And who is she? My niece, Xiao Yun. Say hello to Zhou Jun. Hello! You're so pretty! What a clever girl! It goes without saying. You must know who her teacher is. It can't be you. She pays sincere compliments. Yours are sweet nothings. Sweet nothings from a glib tongue. Such a clever girl! I'm not carrying you anymore! I'm not carrying you. If he's not carrying you, I will! Sir. Come in! We have a lot of new girls! Hey! Inspector Cheng! Happy New Year. Sit down. A small token. A thank you for your help over the past few months. I've heard some news that some people are starting trouble. Have you heard anything? Inspector Cheng. Just tell me what you know. There is this thing that's been going around in the streets. That during the riot, you didn't help a Malay woman. I heard that her child died because of you. What Malay woman? What are you saying? Just some rumors I've heard. But heed my advice. If you want your family to be safe, just let the matter rest. What do you mean? You didn't hear it from me. What is this? From what I know, all the gangs are buying supplies from the same dealer. They are at some warehouse. I just gave you the address. That's the man. The one who didn't help the woman. All of you! Run! Run! Don't move! Go, run! Amin! Hey! Go! Go! Amin! Sir, my friend's hurt. Sir, are you all right? I'm all right. Don't touch me! Everybody all right? - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Sir, the rest got away. Sir. Blood for blood. You are going to pay for this! You'll never get away with it. What are you saying? How could you walk away? What if it was your own child? Your family. Be careful. Shut up! Sir, don't listen to his nonsense. Bring them back to the station! - Yes, sir! Go. - Yes, sir! Almost there. It's not easy. Keep the coin. Xiao Yun! Dad! Pastries for Grandma. Soft drink for you. Soft drink! Thank you, Dad! It's the New Year, let's enjoy ourselves. Grandma, this is for you. Seng, you are wonderful. You always remember my favorite. It's Cheng who bought it, Mother. Mom. You cooked chicken. This is called Samsui Ginger Chicken. These are sweet potato leaves. My Samsui sisters loved eating these. They worked tirelessly under the sun. Seng, do you remember them? Of course, I remember. Here are the soft drinks. Here you go. Everyone's here! Grandma. Dad. Mom. Uncle. - Let's eat! - Let's eat! Mom. Cheng. Mei. - Let's eat. - Mom, let's eat. Mother, let's eat. Mother. Here you go, Xiao Yun. Eat slowly. Don't eat so fast. Look at both of you. Can't tell who the child is. He is! You're the child! You are also a child. Mei, where did you get a chicken from? Our neighbor Aisha wanted fish. So, I exchanged with her. You exchanged food with the Malays? That's nothing unusual. Besides, it's New Year's Eve. Isn't it good to have chicken? I don't eat food from the Malays. Where are you going? Sit down. Why do I always have to listen to you? Seng, sit down. Where are you going? Sit down. Our neighbor told me there's a rumor that the Malays... What? Seems like the rumor is true. Apparently, a young Malay boy died because you didn't help him. Some Malays even threatened you. Is that true? Cheng. Are they really threatening you? I did arrest some people. They're bound to say rubbish. The Malays think they're better than us. First, it was the British, cooking up empty promises - to protect the interests of the Chinese. - Stop it. - What? Am I wrong? - Stop it. If we don't do anything, - they'll think we're weak. - Please stop... It's New Year's Eve. Can we have our dinner in peace? Can we? Xiao Yun, you're still awake? Dad, I can't sleep. Can you stay with me? Where's the lucky coin I gave you? It's here? This is not just a lucky coin. It can also protect you. When you're holding on to it, me, your grandma, your mom, and your uncle will be by your side, protecting you. Should I tell you a bedtime story? Yes. Promise to sleep after the story? All right. Let me tell you a story. Cheng. Cheng. I couldn't find Xiao Yun the whole morning. Maybe she's at the neighbor's? I've checked. Cheng. Check over there. Xiao Yun! Did my daughter come over to play? No. No? Thank you. Xiao Yun! What's going on? - Did my daughter come over? - No. Thank you. No, she didn't come over. - No? Thank you. - Yes. Xiao Yun! Xiao Yun! Mei. What's going on? We can't find Xiao Yun. Can't find her? Xiao Yun! Cheng, where has Xiao Yun gone? Xiao Yun! Xiao Yun! Could it be the Malays? The one who threatened you? It has to be him. - Seng! - Seng! Sir. Sir, is there something that... - Where's Ah Chan? - Ah Chan? Ah Chan, where is he? I don't know, sir. The key for the lockup. What on earth is going on here? Ah Chan. Lockup key. - What's going on, sir? - Lockup key. Inspector Cheng. What's going on? My daughter is missing. Do you know where my daughter is? What do you want? Last time, you said that my family must be careful. Did your people take my daughter? Now you know what it's like? Now you know how it feels, right? - Sir, calm down! - Where is my daughter? Sir! - Where is my daughter? - I don't know! Where is my daughter? - Sir, calm down! - Where is my daughter? I ask you, where's my daughter? - Sir! - Where is my daughter? - I don't know! - Where is she? - Where is my daughter? - Sir! Calm down! I don't know! Even if I knew, why would I tell you? Sir, listen to me! If you really think they're responsible, we will need him to talk, sir. Sir, we need to investigate. Sir. Ah Chan, stop! Ah Chan, stop hitting him! Where is his daughter? Stop hitting, Ah Chan! That's enough! The inspector managed to hold himself together. But this episode in the prison cell was far from over. Outside the gate, something dark was forming. By the time we knew, it was too late. Sir! I think you better come and see, sir! Why are you helping them? You're Chinese! Why are you helping them? Hand him over! Hand him over! Bring him out! We want justice! Hand him over! Why are you helping them? Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! It's Adi. Adi, you must have seen it. You're a policeman. The Chinese have gone too far. They killed one of our people. You must have seen it. - Don't you dare deny it. - I... What? You are just going to keep quiet? You're not doing anything about it? Didn't they cause your brother's death? It's not that. Coward. Let's go, we're just wasting our time. Hurry up. Let's go. Coward. What did that guy say to you? I... What? I don't know, Mom. Don't you understand? He could have helped but didn't. What is it? Are you trying to defend him? I'm not defending him, Mom. What did you do? What did you tell the villagers? What did I do? I just told everyone the truth. Mom! You are making things worse, Mom! This is what some people want. He let other people take your brother away from me. How can you work for someone like that? Now... His daughter... His daughter is missing. There is justice then. What your aunt said is right. We should leave this place. Let's leave, Adi. The Chinese, one minute they are our neighbors, the next, they are murderers of children. We have to leave. You have to leave with me! Mom! You should seek solace, Mom. Rafi is gone, Mom. You have to find peace. Xiao Yun was taken by the Malays. What? Xiao Yun was taken? Why is this happening? Who else could it be? That's what everyone is saying. But... Isn't your brother a policeman? What did he say? Does he also think the Malays took her? My brother? Now, everyone is saying he didn't help a Malay boy which caused his death. So, they want revenge. Those are just rumors. I have a Malay friend. Maybe I can ask her. She might be able to help. Zhou Jun. Now isn't the time to be friendly with the Malays. I saw one of them killed in front of me today. If Xiao Yun can't be found, even if more of them die, they deserve it. Seng. Seng, you can't think this way. You can't think this way. Zhou Jun. I know people like Ah Kai. They have a lot of connections. They stand for their beliefs. We have guns and weapons. We need to unite, plan, and take action! - What are you saying? - Zhou Jun, listen to me. You know first aid. You should join us too. You have guns and weapons? Zhou Jun, listen to me. You can help us! Who are these people, Seng? Zhou Jun, come with me. Let's go! I'm not going. You need help? Mom. Mom, what are you doing here? Your mother? What am I doing here? Why are you still here? Why are you still working for this man? This man. He could have saved your brother, but he didn't. During the riot, I begged for your help. My son, Rafi, was just in front of you. You must have seen me. You must have seen him. I did not see him. - I really didn't! - You must have seen him! - Mom, let's go. - Shut up. I didn't see him! - You must have seen him! - Mom. Let's go, Mom. Children, come along. To make yourself happier, remember this. That he, who sits down and spends his time, facing the unpleasant facts of life is more likely to resolve them than if you believe they do not exist. They do exist. Those things are being said. Although not in the language you and I normally read, those things are being said. And if allowed to go on may lead to a great deal of unhappiness, trials, and tribulations. It has all happened before. We learn from the past. And I hope that together we have sufficient trust and confidence in each other to forge solidarity to face the problems within Malaysia. Problems that are accentuated by confrontation. Fear could be dangerous and contagious. The inspector and my mother were acting out of fear. My mother is now afraid for her other three children. While the inspector spent three days and three nights looking for his daughter. Did the inspector see my mother? Or even noticed my brother in the riot? And why did the inspector think the Malays took his daughter? Attacking someone because he or she was Chinese or Malay did not make sense. But living in a time of fear, very little made sense. What was right? What was wrong? And what was the right thing to do? Was Xiao Yun really taken by the Malays? Was it? Why would they do that? Why would they do something like that? Why? Why? Why did they take our daughter? Why? A line was drawn on the sand. And with it, we could feel the tension mounting. Everyone was walking around like a ticking time bomb. Seng, it's good that you are here. I'm begging you. You have so many people. Can you help me find Xiao Yun? That goes without saying. We'll get back what they owe us. Teach them not to mess with us. Justice has to be served. Blood for blood. Hurry, take all of it. We all act and react differently. Some chose to conspire. Some chose to reflect. Some chose to stay, while some chose to leave. Watch the bags! Don't leave anything behind. Be a good boy. Take care of Mom. I saw the inspector, a leader of men, reduced to a helpless and frightened figure. There are two sides to responsibilities. They can weigh you down. The same responsibilities can give you strength. At the end of the road, you either give in to despair or look at your responsibilities and find the faith to act again. The situation was the same. But the inspector is now different. There are times when the only solution is action. Thank you everyone for your help. We'll search over there later. Let's spread out. Everyone, spread out. Xiao Yun! - Xiao Yun! - Xiao Yun! - Xiao Yun! - Xiao Yun! Missing child Missing child Mom! Quick, move the people! - Hurry! - Save them first! - Save them! - Help them quickly! - Is there anyone who's hurt? - Hurry! Hurry! Is there anyone who's hurt? Help them! Lift it higher! Help them! What the blaze is going on there? And how many are injured? And how many people do we have on the ground? And what... Hello? Hello? - A lot of people. - Sir. I can help. This bomb was what we were talking about. You should send more people down to cover three more blocks. Now hospitals should have a lot of victims. You should send more people down there from other districts. Sir. Calm down. Drink? It was always going to be met with opposition from the neighbors, the Federation of Malaysia. Inciting fear, ill will, and hatred amongst the races. Some things are worse than an all-out declaration of war. This is a real campaign of terror. What do you mean? What I'm saying. Your daughter, her disappearance. Why do you all think the Malays are involved? You mean the people outside the country are creating problems? They're behind this? Konfrontasi? Missing child Bring Mom some water. Fetch some clean towels. Mom, are you all right? - Are you all right? - I'm fine. Where are your siblings? We're your children. We're strong. When Dad left us, we were so lost. You kept this family together. Mom. It is now my turn. It's my turn to take care of this family. Rafi is gone. He's gone. There is nothing we can do to bring him back. Seng. Seng, where have you been? Why are you here? I was waiting for you. Waiting for me? What's wrong? They started it. That's why we retaliated. Blood for blood. Blood for blood? Everything that I've done is for Xiao Yun. What are you saying? Don't tell me this bomb... Zhou Jun. Listen to me. Everything I've done is for Xiao Yun, for all of us. I'm not what you think I am. - Zhou Jun, listen to me. - What have you done? Zhou Jun, I'm not what you think I am. Do you know what you have done? Please listen to me, Zhou Jun. Seng! You said the Malays are no good. You said they took our children. Is this what you call justice? I was at the hospital earlier. I saw... I saw the injured Malays. I saw the Chinese helping them. I also saw the injured Chinese and the Malays helping them. Also, I saw an Indian man. He was holding Xiao Yun's flyer. He asked me if I've seen Xiao Yun. Whether she has been found or not. Everything I've seen is different from what you're saying! Seng. When my dad and I arrived from China, we were hoping for a better life. Not for all this. Not for all this fighting and killing. My dad wants to return home. I can understand why. It's because he grew up there. That place is familiar to him. But I don't feel the same. I grew up here. I have friends and relatives here. I want to have a home here. I want to start a family here. I want to have a better life. To be happy, to live happily. I don't want to go back to China! Is that wrong? Am I wrong? I... Seng. You... You said you want to take care of me. But... But after what you've done, I... I don't know how I can trust you. Seng. Can you really take care of me? Do you still want to take care of me? Seng. Seng. Be careful. Sir? I did not see your son. I really did not see her son. I really did not see her son! I'm Mei. I'm his wife. Our daughter... She has been missing for 20 days. Can you be sure? That you saw with your own eyes, that I saw your son and did not help him? "Can you be sure that you saw with your own eyes, I saw your son and did not help him?" You Malays think that we Chinese are out to harm you. And we Chinese think the Malays are out to harm us. You said that I caused your son's death. Now that my daughter is missing, can I then say you Malays have taken her? Have you thought about it? Your son's death and my daughter's disappearance, may not be the doings of Malay or Chinese. Look around us! It's chaos! Everyone is afraid. What are we afraid of? Afraid we can't take care of our families. When we are scared, the things we see, hear, and believe in may all be wrong! I don't want to be scared anymore. Because I don't want to do the wrong thing. I want to do the right thing. I want to do the right thing! Mei. God willing, she will be safe. There will always be evil in this world. Thank you. Seng. - Where's Ah Kai? - He's not here yet. Have you donated? We received a lot of donations today. We have enough funds for our next operation. Come. Help us count. Come on in. Hey! Have you all donated? Hurry up! Here's my contribution. Here's mine. You two take care of this. We've got to go. Hey! Where are you going? Sometimes, help could come from the most unexpected corner. This time, it came right through the door. She was more than the daughter of a coffee shop owner. She was one of the few who had the courage to befriend the Malays. Now, she needed to be brave again. Xiao Yun. We must follow their orders. So we'll wait here now? Yes, remember, this is temporary. Don't let them run away. Let's do things one step at a time. Should we check if there are police outside? Yes, we should. Xiao Yun. Hey! What is he doing here? Catch him! What are you doing? - Hold him! - Don't let him go! Don't let him get away! - Please just let us go! - Let us go! - Let me go! - Help! - How is this possible? - Is he sent by the police? - We're in deep trouble! - Told you not to do that! - It's impossible! - Help us! - What should we do now? - Help! - Let go of me, help! - Help! - Let me go! - Help me! - Help! - Leave them! - Let us go! - Help, please! - He's burning this place down! - Let's go! - Don't leave us here! - No! Help! Let's go. Help! - Help. - Xiao Yun. - Please! - Help! Let's leave together! It's Seng's motorbike! Seng must be here! Ah Chan, Goh! Watch her. Don't be rash. I'm not here to arrest anyone! I'm looking for my brother! I'm looking for my brother. He's Zheng Ka Seng. He's not here. My men are right outside. I've already said he is not here. There's a fire there. What's happening? Seng discovered our secret storage. We decided to burn it down. He was left behind. Consider him unlucky. Seng's over there! Over there! The fire's getting bigger. The fire's getting bigger. It's hot, ma'am - It's hot! - Run! - Are there still people inside? - Yes! Seng! Hurry! Run! Seng! Seng! Have you seen Seng? Seng! Seng! You stay here. You watch her. Sir, help! Hurry! Take that! Seng! Seng! More water! Hurry! More water! Seng! Seng! Seng! Seng! Seng. Cheng. Xiao Yun. More water! - Hurry! - Over here, sir. Sir! Xiao Yun! Xiao Yun! Seng! Seng! Seng! Seng. What happened to him? Seng, wake up. Seng. Please wake up. I beg you, please wake up. Please wake up! I beg you. Sir! - Please wake up! - Sir! Sir! Seng. Seng. Seng. Seng. Dad. I'm here. Seng. Seng. There's still fire. Seng. Seng. In a war, people unite and fight. In an undeclared war, the enemy was faceless. It broke the very unity we needed to fight it with. External forces were instigating groups of people to incite racial hatred and violence. So we never knew who was responsible for the bombings, who was responsible for the disappearance of the children. But now, we knew both the Malays and the Chinese were manipulated. Our problems were not between us. Our problems were beyond racial lines. I thought you had left? Looks like the rumors of separation with Malaysia are true. I was there when Pakistan fought for independence. Millions lost their lives. Trust me, the problems in Singapore will not end with separation. If anything, they've only just begun. What would happen to a country trying to gain its independence like this? Against its own will? How can people divided become one? Churchill once said, "If the present tries to sit in judgment on the past, it will lose the future." Really, why are you still here? The heat in this country tends to fog my memory. Boss, you've bought a television? Did you get your coffee? - That's easy. - No. They will serve you shortly. That's amazing! Be careful. Did you get your coffee? Come on, hurry up. Wait, I'm here. Let's listen to what they are going to say. - Goodness. - Push that. Can you see? We're small. Our country is small. You see, it's a moment of... You know, every time we look back on this moment when we signed this agreement, which severed Singapore from Malaysia, it will be a moment of anguish. I mean, for me, it is a moment of anguish because all my life... You see, the whole of my adult life, I... I had believed in the Malaysian merger and the unity of these two territories. You know, its people connected by geography, economics, and ties of kinship. Would you mind if we stop for a while? All right. I'm ready. And I would like finally, if I may, just to speak not to you, but really to the people of Singapore. There is nothing to worry about. Most things will go on just as usual. But be firm, be calm. We are going to have a multi-racial nation in Singapore. We will set the example. This is not a Malay nation. This is not a Chinese nation. This is not an Indian nation. Finally, let us all, really, Singaporeans, I cannot call myself a Malaysian now. We unite. Regardless of race, language, religion, culture. That hurts. You're just going to look? When are you going to bring a girl home? Goodness, Mom. I'm still young. And you want me to find a wife here? Why not? Not a bad place to start looking. I thought you wanted to leave? Naughty boy. Let's go home. Come, dear. Dad. Why did you get a television set? If business is good, we can earn more money and live a better life. Isn't that good? Why are you still standing there? Go serve our customers. All right. Dad, look! This is you and all of us. This is Grandma, you, Mom, me, my brother, and Uncle. - Did you draw this? - Yes. On the 23rd of March, like many Singaporeans, I woke up to the news that our founding father was no more. We were all waiting for the news, allowing us the time to accept the inevitable. Heavy with the knowledge that, for many of us, the Singapore we knew would never be quite the same. Our lives, our stories, cannot be separated from the life and story of this man. A man who gave us the courage to look for the light when it was bleak and hopeless. With unexpected independence thrusted upon a racially divided people, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew rose to the occasion. "We will survive!" he assured. You know what? We more than survived. We thrived. From the creation of a nation, I saw with fellow Singaporeans the building of a nation. Where a Malay man like me felt at home. Where an immigrant like the inspector became a citizen. From 1965, Lee Kuan Yew went on to forge the most diverse yet peaceful multi-racial country in the world. For me, and those who lived through the riots, the bombings, those of us who suffered personal losses. We do not want this time in Singapore to be just in our history books. We want to tell these stories. So that our children and grandchildren will know how precious, and fragile, some things are.
