A few weeks ago, the U.S. Federal Bank's Fraud Department in Washington was alerted to a new type of fake U.S. dollar circulating around the world. Photographic and cinematographic documents concerning some suspects in the case have just arrived in Washington, where they are being examined by Special Services... Stop! I haven't seen him in a long time, but I know him. Are you sure? His name is Sacha. You know, you don’t have to accept this mission. The people you’ll be dealing with do not like prying eyes. No way. Do you remember Fred Oliver? Yes, very well. A week ago, he was sitting in this very chair. Yesterday, I was notified of his death. You have very little chance of seeing this through. I’m used to it. If you succeed, that’s perfect. But if you don't, don’t count on us to cover you. Let’s not waste time. What is it? Do you know the Costa Salvador? It’s a country in South America. - Are you sending me there? - Not there. To France. When do I leave? Bear with us. I suppose you’ve heard about Gen. Pachado? Ex-dictator of Costa Salvador? We have reliable information: he is trying very hard to regain power. Pachado’s officers are gathering weapons in Europe. They placed orders for huge amounts of money. We want to know where the money comes from. And you’re counting on me to find out. Yes. You’re going to Nice this evening. Here’s your safe passage. You'll be able to travel on military planes. And also, your new identity. Vice-consul in Nice? You went all out! Well, here you are, getting your feet wet and in a setting that doesn’t encourage zeal. I bet real consuls take it easy in Nice. But you, you’re not allowed to dream. Duty comes first. You already had the chance to get your hands on Sacha. Don’t be late meeting him. Hello. What do you want from me? - You don’t seem happy to see me again. - I am, I wouldn’t have come otherwise. Be quick. I don’t have time to waste here. You know, I never forgot what you did for me. - Don’t be soft, you’ll make me cry. - I don’t want that. - I just want to warn you. - What do you care? - You’re asking for trouble. - I’m old enough to defend myself. I know. Be careful. You shouldn’t have bothered. Anyway, if you need me, here’s my card. Hey, you! What’s your problem? Come on! Are we done? Take this one away first. Sorry Well, don’t just stand there! Chuck them all in the paddy wagon! The ladies over there, let’s go! Do I have to come get you myself? Come on! That hypocrite Commissioner is certainly going to report me at the consulate. I'll be in big trouble again. I have never seen such a diplomat! Ever since I’ve been a consul in Nice. I am aware that you have strong support. Well, I don’t give a damn. If you make a scene again, no one will stop me from kicking you out of this office. Is that clear? It’s clear. I will be away the whole weekend. Try to relax. You relax. That’s all I ask of you. I just hope this place is still standing when I get back. We all hope so. I’d like you to meet Barbara, our faithful secretary. To the naked eye, she seems charming, but don’t try to woo her. You’ll waste your time. I’ve already tried. Excuse me, Mr. Stanley, may I remind you of your schedule today? Go on. At 4:00 p.m., you're meeting with the president of the Chamber of Commerce. I have nothing to tell him. - At 5:00 p.m., tea with Lady Diana Miller. - I don’t want any tea. At 9:00 p.m., Japanese Consulate reception. At that time, I have other things to do. Hello? Who’s speaking? It’s personal. Don’t hang up, I’ll ask. - Who is it? - A man who doesn’t want to say his name. Here at the consulate, though, we never take this kind of call. - Should I tell him you’re busy? - I’ll tell him myself. Hello? Sacha? Hello? Can we meet tomorrow in San Remo? - Right away, if you like. - No, tomorrow, in San Remo. - All good? - No. Not good at all. - As soon as possible. - You might be right. - Are you going to the Japanese reception? - How do you know that? - I don’t know. I’m asking. - Hello? - Meet me at 10:30 p.m. at the consulate. - Okay. 10:30 p.m. - Will you be there? - I told you I will. You should really go to the Japanese reception. Since you insist, I’ll go. - And for tea with Lady Diana? - No. - Do you need anything else from me? - No. If you need any information, I am happy to help. Okay, I get it. Goodbye. This girl gets on my nerves. - What did you say, sir? - Nothing. Who told Sacha about this Japanese reception? You’d think he was the detective. Mr. Robert Stanley! You work too much, Commissioner. He's here at last. Do something. You promised, and nothing is happening. - Don't tell me how to do my job. - The clock is ticking. It must be all safely across the border before the others figure it out. Otherwise... I’m worried things will go wrong. Don’t worry. This is my cue. Leave me alone. - Are you enjoying it here? - Not sure yet. I’ve just arrived and don’t know anyone. Everyone here knows you or wants to, especially the ladies. - You exaggerate a little. - I’m not exaggerating. For example, this beautiful brunette... - Who is she? - Hilda Porensen. Independent, lives in the Negresco and divorced, I believe. Thanks for the tip. I'd like to give you another gift from a friend in New York. With pleasure. Tax evasion is not a good thing. You’ll end up in trouble. - The Customs officers turn a blind eye. - They shouldn’t. I need to confiscate her. Mr. Stanley, right? - You know me as well. - Your reputation precedes you. You’ve been here for eight days, you’re all we talk about. Don’t believe what people say. It’s nice things, if what they say about you is true. You’ll just have to see for yourself. - That could be dangerous. - Are you afraid of danger? No, quite the opposite. Prove it. What are you doing this weekend? That depends on you. - I was thinking of going to San Remo. - It’s a very fashionable place. - It's quiet. - Too quiet. Let’s go to Cannes! I can't. I’m meeting with friends. I can’t do that to them. You’re abandoning me for friends? For one hour, not longer. Promise? Otherwise, why would I take you? Well then, if I can be excused, I’ll give you a call. - You don’t even know my name. - Well now, Hilda. I know a lot about you. - Goodbye. - But-- See you tomorrow... maybe. - What’s going on? - I don’t know. I just arrived. Don’t touch anything. This way. There’s a telephone. Did you know him? - What’s going on? - Nothing. The officer wants to make a phone call. - Did you know him? - Never seen him before. What’s going on? I told you not to touch anything! I didn’t. What’s the matter? Nothing. Don’t move. You'll tell it to the Commissioner. Poor Sacha. He was a great artist. During the Occupation, his fake IDs were better than the real ones. But it never ends well for artists. I would like to ask you a few questions. - All right. Let’s go to my office. - Okay, let’s go. What? What was the name? Ah, Roucov. Thanks. So, what can I do for you, Commissioner? Well, give me back what you took from the corpse. I don’t know what you mean. You’re playing with fire, Mr. Stanley. You shouldn't. You’d better give me that plate back. Sorry, I don’t have it. You must have taken it while the officer was away. As you wish. You don’t know the victim, do you? Absolutely not. Sacha Roucov, mean anything to you? No, nothing. You won’t let me search you, will you? Why not? Of course. In that case, I will have to conduct a police search. No. Are you refusing? This is a consulate, and you’re a guest here. You think you’re safe behind your diplomatic immunity. Twenty-four hours. It's enough time to get it under way. Forty-eight. It’s Saturday tomorrow. No one’s here, it's closed. What are you doing here at 11 p.m.? The night watchman warned me. I thought it was a good idea to come. In the absence of the Consul, I’m the boss! - I thought I could take the liberty-- - You take far too many liberties, Miss. The Consul has always approved of my initiatives. I get the impression that you don’t like me at all. All I want to do is help. What do you have against me? Nothing. But the people meeting with the Consul wouldn't usually get themselves murdered in front of the consulate door. Do you still want to help me? - Yes. - Find me a villa in San Remo for tomorrow. Did you know that the consulate is guarded by police officers? They’re in for a very busy weekend. You should let them sort it out themselves. If I let them be, they’ll stop me and, after getting this far, it would be such a shame. - What can they do to you? - For 48 hours, nothing. Hello, Negresco? Madam Hilda Porensen. Strictly business. Hilda? Stanley. Ah, you’re on time. - Always. - A bit too much to be honest. Put it in the trunk. - Won’t you need it during the journey? - Do as I say. BORDER - 1.2 MILES Why are you always looking in the rear-view mirror? - Checking if we’re being followed. - There would be no reason. There is! Why? What have you done? Me, nothing. But the police believe otherwise. - The police? - Yes. But I don’t see anyone. That doesn’t prove anything. Maybe they were called at the border. We’ll find out soon enough. CUSTOMS NATIONAL SECURITY Passports, please. Thank you. With the look on her face, it's not chocolates in her suitcases. - You can go. - Do you want to check our luggage? Go to my colleague at the Italian customs. Can you open your trunk, please? - Do you have anything to declare? - No. - Give me a suitcase. - Which one? This one. Thank you. - Leave it! Diplomatic corps. - Excuse me. Here’s one who just missed out on getting a promotion anytime soon. And some color returns to my little vamp's cheeks. SAN REMO - THREE MILES - So, you’re no longer angry? - I never was. It’s funny, you’d think you were scared of me. Not you. The police. - Are you in trouble with the police? - Not me. You! I was rather amused. Weren’t you? - I wasn't. Your company is enough. - Thanks. You’ll have to slow down a bit. Hotel Reale is around the corner. - We’re not going to the hotel. - Are you in charge now? I am, until further notice. There's refreshments inside. You might want to quench your thirst. - What about our luggage? - Don’t worry. I’ll take care of it. Come this way. You seem very organized, Mr. Stanley. - That’s me. - May I use the telephone? Hello? Hotel Reale? Can you pass me through to Mr. Michel Durand, please? He’s not arrived yet? Are you sure? Can you please take a message, then? That he calls 846 37. It’s urgent. Thanks. I'm getting in the way of your plans. Not at all. Hello? It’s for you. A woman. Hello? Excuse me, sir. I don’t have the keys to the trunk. Right, our luggage. One second. Hello, Barbara? - Who? - Michel Durand. A friend of your friend Sacha. Yes, he’s beside me. Hand him over. Just one moment. I’m listening. It's Michel. Michel Durand, a friend of Sacha’s. Yes. We had to leave this morning at 6:00 a.m. for San Remo. He’s disappeared. Yes. Since he was meeting with you last night, I thought maybe you would know where I can find him. I don’t want to get ahead of myself, but there's nothing for you in San Remo. Actually... - Shall I wait for you? - Yes. - And this gentleman as well? - Clearly. Nothing boring, I hope? No, it was my secretary. Without me, she goes crazy. You’re not drinking? Our luggage first. - Where are you going? - I’ll be back for lunch. NICE - 15 MILES Some cognac and a telephone. Miss, is there no booth here? - You have secrets? - Excuse me. Hello? Is that you, Barbara? Speak up. I can’t hear you. You are mistaken, sir. It’s me, Stanley. What’s going on? Sorry, the Consulate is closed on a Saturday. The cops are there? Exactly, sir. Don’t worry. They won’t find anything. All right, go to Place Barel in 25 minutes with your car, okay? Goodbye, sir. Where can I wash my hands? Back there. - Don’t you have any change? - No. Hello, it’s detective Dussolier. He's at the border. We're following him. No, he’s in the toilet. Don’t worry about it. What were the cops doing? A search. Yes, your dear Hilda Porensen smuggles fake money and is a close friend of Sacha’s. The cops knew about this? Did you know? Well, of course! Were you followed? I don’t think so. And the cops, did they see Michel? No, he wouldn’t wait. But we’re going to his house. - Does he know Sacha is dead? - You’ll tell him yourself. Michel! Michel! Stanley! A lovely green. Dollar color! Do you think it’s necessary to leave your fingerprints everywhere? You have a good head for break-ins. This way, Madame Arsène Lupin. "Invalid 08 86." "Notice for Mr. Fernando Guzman--" - What are you doing here? - And you? - I came to do the housework. - Not today. - What do you mean? - Mr. Michel is away for the day. That is why I should tidy this place up. Tomorrow. I see. As you wish. What do I do with the mail? Give it to me. All right, goodbye now. "Visa from two days ago, signed by Fernando Guzman." I did some groceries for Mr. Michel. Very well. There is a Costa Salvador consulate in Nice. Why did he apply for a visa in Paris? Do you know why? I never know why. Where are you going? Paris. In 15 minutes, there will be roadblocks everywhere. I’m going to the military airfield. - The police will arrive at the same time. - I’ll keep a low profile. Quai d’Orléans 14, fifth floor. Stay at my place. The hotels will be under watch. Hello? Could you tell me to which subscriber the number Invalid 08 86 corresponds? Yes. She could have told me she had a great figure. Hello? No, I wasn't talking to you. The Costa Salvador Consulate? Are you sure? Excuse me. Thanks. Was it you who called for a taxi? Yes, I’m in a hurry. Where to? COSTA SALVADOR EMBASSY I must have been in my twenties, the last time I broke into a foreign embassy. Fernando Guzman... de Los Rios, too. Who can you trust? Generals should never play politics. GENERAL PACHADO’S PLOT FAILED TWO SENIOR OFFICERS ARRESTED There’s a man hidden on the first floor. Go downstairs, in case he tries to escapes. He must have an address, this Fernando. He doesn’t sleep under bridges, surely. Here we are. Hello, police? This is the embassy-- Who’s there? - A friend who means well. - What are you doing here? - I want to see Fernando de Los Rios. - I don’t know who you’re talking about. Of course, you know! Go get him. I have a taxi waiting for me. - I’m alone here. - All alone? What’s going on? Please leave, sir. Robert Stanley, Consular Attaché in Nice, Alpes-Maritimes. Fernando Guzman de Los Rios. Chief Secretary at the Costa Salvador Embassy. Nice to meet you. - Tequila? - No, never on duty. To what do we owe the pleasure? Just something minor concerning a visa that you gave to a certain Michel Durand. You recognize your signature, don’t you? Yes, I sign about 50 a day. Yes, but this one isn’t like the others. What’s so special about it? It wasn’t registered. I did a little investigating at your embassy. - When? - Today. - It’s closed. - I opened it. - You’re reckless. - No, just curious. - Let’s talk about my dollars. - Don’t worry, they’re safe. - Are you here to negotiate? - Oh no. I had such a hard time getting them. Where did you find this passport? - In Michel’s mail. - You dared to open it? Poor thing, he was no longer in shape to do it himself. - What do you mean? - Haven’t you heard? Poor organization. Michel’s been shot. Sacha as well. You knew that and you let me take the same risk? I knew nothing! Don’t touch it. Don’t do it. Hello? You scared them off. Come on, Mr. Stanley, what are you getting at? I want to know why you gave a fake visa to Michel Durand. - That’s none of your business. - Now, you have two murders on your hands. - I had no reason-- - You did though! This one. There was great deal of distrust. Sacha kept the second plate, the reverse side. You killed them both to get your hands on that second plate. - I didn't kill Michel and Sacha! - I know. I need those dollars. Hand them over and the plate’s yours. What would I do with it? You could sell it or try to find the other half. - Do it yourself, pinhead! - I can’t do it. Stanley, it’s dangerous. He wants to get away with it at your expenses. I’ll sell you my half. Is that not enough? I’ll have a think. - Decide quickly. - I’m in as much as a hurry as you are. Stanley! I have something to tell you. I don't quite get it. Take me with you. Don’t leave me with him. Oh no. Not the same mistake twice. Don’t push your luck. Trust me, don't sell the dollars in France. Especially not in Paris. - They would get you right away. - Who’s "they"? The people on the telephone? - Are they really that mean? - Yes. Tell me everything you know. I can’t say anything. Very well. Goodbye, Madam. I met Fernando three months ago. He liked to gamble. I know. - He lost a lot. - So what? We used his connections to get rid of the fake bills. Who’s "we"? Earlier, it was "they". I don’t know. Fernando never told me "who" gave him orders. Do you know what these orders were? It was something big: millions of dollars dropped all over the world at once. You were bound to get caught. It increased so much that Michel and Sacha got scared. So, you decided to operate on your own. With both plates, the four of us could have quietly made our banknotes in South America. But you had to get there. With those excellent visas provided by Mr. Fernando. - Is that all you know? - That’s all. What do you plan to do? I’m going for a ride. It takes longer to go to bed in Paris than it takes to go from Nice to Orly. What are you doing here? To warn you. The police know that you’re in Paris. Barbara. Hilda. - What is she doing in my house? - She chose freedom. Besides, you will become good friends. It’s nice of you to have come. - You can keep each other company. - Where are you going? I have very important things to do and no time to explain. You won’t get anywhere. Stay put. You’re both so cute. - Where are we going? - Montmartre. - Did you leave the lady at home? - The lady is sulking! Hey! Wait for me! Wow. He’s got a harem, this guy! - Still going to Montmartre? - Yes. We mustn’t go there. Hilda told me so. All the more reason to start there. I’m scared, Stanley. We should explain everything to the police. You know, to catch the big fish, you have to keep casting bait, and afterwards, if you’re lucky, the fish may come to bite. By the way, I didn’t invite you on this fishing trip. Please don’t send me away. I’ll stay in the car, if you want. Too bad. - Hey. - Sir? Do you deal here? Unfortunately not, sir. But go see the gentleman over there. Yes, of course. We can find some cocaine, but you know, it’s rare. The rarer it is, the more expensive it is. It will be at least 1,000 francs per sachet. Can you find me a lot of it? Oh, you don’t need that much, once you’ve had three or four. I have friends. Do you have any dollars? And what’s this? Well then, I know people who can exchange them for you. How much? You know currently, the official rate... Can we do it? - Who’s this? - It’s Bébert. - Bébert who? - Bébert Silongue! Sir, come in. Have a drink while I negotiate this. How much do you want? Five hundred. Are you having champagne with her? She brings good luck. - Are you here for games? - I don’t know which one yet. I swear, Paulo, I brought you a nice one. He doesn’t look bad, quite right. Later would have been better, when there’s less people. We do what we can, right? Where should I send him? Your office? My office in five minutes. - I think it will work out. - A glass for the gentleman? Of course, but some real champagne. I don’t want to poison my friend. What do you want now? I’m losing more than I’m making. You can make it up. Bébert brought us a nice one. Without me, gentlemen. You’re right. I think he’s in our hands. Yes, I see many men in your life. - Really? - You’re wanted in the office. I’ll leave you to it. You’re big enough to defend yourself. So I'll need to defend myself? Please sit. You’ll excuse me, I’m in a bit of a hurry. - So you have some dollars to exchange. - Yes. Five hundred. Let’s see. Are ten dollar bills okay? Nobody move! Judicial police! This is a huge crime. Now you can’t say you are wrongly suspected, Mr. Broncoli. I swear to you, Detective, this is a one off. We’ve been monitoring your trafficking for three weeks. We were warned. - And this one, do you know him? - No. Probably a new one. Your ID. Please, gentlemen, is there any way to fix this? Attempted bribery. Be very careful to what you say. Sure, fake police my-- It’s the risks of the trade. Watch out, here he comes. What about my top line? I see nothing. From your boss. - We’ve kept an eye on you. - Why are you telling me this? You’re a nuisance. Go away. Montmartre is a big place! It really is. There are even two cemeteries. Here, here! I’ll think about it. Think quickly. The guys are tired. You make them work overtime. They’re not happy. Yet, they look so friendly. If you don’t mind, I have a date with a lady, and that is sacred to me. What's the most expensive club in Montmartre? "Expensive"? The Grand Frisson. But it’s kind of neat. To the Grand Frisson, then. So, how's the fishing? I think my fish should swim in less troubled waters. - Yes, but what’s going on? - Next to nothing. Barbara. You are the most devoted, loveliest secretary in the world, and I like you very much, but today it’s Saturday and the office is closed. Go home. No. All right. But we don’t know each other, got it? - Are you with the lady? - No, I'm alone. Good evening, sir. I can give you and excellent table near the dancing floor. Unless you prefer going to the bar? The table. In case you don’t intend to remain alone, sir... Veuve Clicquot 47, one magnum. You’re alone and request a magnum? Yes, I’m thirsty. Hey, man. Bring the boss here, and fast. - Excuse me? - The boss! - The boss? - Yes. Yes? Don’t you get bored all alone at that big table? Barbara, you’re exhausting! It’s this gentleman. Funny, aren’t they, these phones? I don’t think so. - You asked for me? - Sit down. How can I help you? I would like to spend my first night in Paris here. We would be delighted and honored. But the banks are closed. Can you exchange some? Currency legislation prohibits us from doing so, but to be nice to you... - How much do you need? - What time do you close? Never before 6:00 a.m. Five hundred thousand. And what’s your rate? Ten minutes. Yes? What does this mean? Are you crazy? Mr. Stanley doesn’t want to be disturbed. He’s in a meeting. Lamartine 47 05. Hello? Charles here, from the Grand Frisson. Tell me, there’s a strange customer here. He’s asking me to exchange 500,000 dollars. They don’t seem very catholic to me. Hold on, number... B459P. Yes, it's all from the same series. That’s what I thought. All right. Okay. Here. You gave me four too many. Madam Monette, have you seen? Yes. So what? He will never be able to spend his money on his own. - And you feel you can help him? - Lady! Don't disturb this gentleman under any circumstances. He’s waiting for someone. I wonder what the hell we’re doing here. - Evening. - Evening, Madam. - You were right to call me. - Of course. Is he alone? Exactly... I see. They arrived at the same time. I think she was following him. What? That’s all I needed to know. I’ll take care of it. Sir, may I? Thanks. Ah, you don’t trust me. Et voilà! Please check, sir. - Do you have a lot of these? - A whole suitcase. Well done. - Oil? - Uranium. - Arizona? - Costa Salvador. Yes? Aren’t you ashamed of charming this whore? You’re going home right now. Why me and not you? - Because it’s getting serious here. - No, I don’t want to leave you. I’d be too afraid for you. Thanks. I like you too, but if you stay, you’ll make things complicated. Take the taxi, go home, lock yourself in with Hilda and pray for me. Yes. - My name is Robert Stanley. - I'm Irène. Is that enough? Yes, for now. It’s a little game of hide and seek that will end badly. Why? It’s a game that everybody plays. But in what state? It depends if you’re the magician or the pigeon. Enough playing around. Let’s talk seriously. - Here? - Here or elsewhere. Elsewhere. Come. Please, come in. Stanley, fetch us a drink. Whisky for me. - So, is Costa Salvador nice? - Remarkable. Tell me a little bit about this country. I’d rather talk about you. And I’d rather hear about your dollars. Irène, a greedy woman? You surprise me. Earlier, I was wondering what kind of man you were. I thought you were a little chatty. I was wrong. You’re more of a discreet type. Too discreet, even. Hands up, Stanley. Wake him up. I usually have black coffee to wake me up. - Where did you find these dollars? - Uranium. - No. - Yes. No! Help him regain his memory. Wait. Where were you? I’ve been calling you all night. What’s wrong? - We must replace Sacha and Michel. - Why? I had to let them go. You can guess why. They no longer get the job done? They did, but wanted to be self-employed. Don’t worry. Things with them are settled. Go, my dear. Obviously, you have never set foot in Costa Salvador. Where does all the money that you're generously handing out come from? I’m generous by nature, Madam. I’m serious. Do you think these three are serious? No. Leave us. Were you thinking of selling me the dollars that belong to me? Not at all. What for? They are too well copied. I’ll be rich for the rest of my life. It might not be that long. - That would be foolish! - Why? I have nothing to lose. I’m getting rid of an intrusive nuisance. Because you’ve never heard the story of the goose that lays the golden eggs that we foolishly kill? Perhaps this is what you’re referring to? It’s a collector’s piece. I’ll buy it. It’s not for sale. - I have a lot of money. - Yes, mine. - It must be for you. - No one knows that I’m here. Don’t believe that. Hello? Do as I said. - It’s for you. - Hello? Stanley, I’m begging you, come get me. These men are scaring me. - So, the plate, Stanley? - What plate? If you want to buy this one from me, you have its counterpart. Make up your mind: the plate or the money. - Both. - No way. You’re forgetting Barbara. No, I haven't forgotten Barbara. It’s 2:10 a.m. I’ll give you until 4:10 a.m. to give me the other plate. If, by then, that piece is not in my possession, I give you my word that your sweet girlfriend will die. I hope I’m making myself clear, Stanley. Very much so. Here’s my suggestion. Madam Jeanne, how do you serve this? He asked for a double. If he said a double, serve him two measuring cups! It’ll be 700. There are always those who want to be different. They come at closing time, and ask for too much. Excuse me! Buddy, you’ll have to put it on my tab for tomorrow. No, I’m sorry. We don’t do that here. It’ll be 750 francs with the call. I’m sorry but I don’t have a penny on me. - You’ll have it tomorrow. - No, I know how it works. You pay straight away. It’s not the Salvation Army, here! - And I’m not a hobo. - Easy! Your ID. If I had my ID, I would have money to pay. It's suspicious. You'll tell your story at the police station. Go get the car. I’ll watch him. There. "Residing at Miss Barbara Dorsey’s house, 14 Quai d’Orléans, fourth floor." - Is that right? - Yes. The local police station will have to check it out. - How long is this all going to take? - Two or three hours. Don’t just stand there. Hello? Fight at the Bar Palace, 38 rue De La Fontaine, - Shots were fired-- - Let’s get a move on! Quick! - What do you want? - Well, the key for... - I have been to your country. - Where? England. After Dunkirk. I can’t remember the name of the village, but we were well received. Come on. We're sorry, but it’s the rules. In every station, wonderful girls gave us cigarettes and chocolates. Okay, your turn. - Will you make up your mind? - We’re not in a hurry. Whatever. Did you see the beating Vaughan took yesterday? Yes. No one seen that knockout coming. For me, that’s the trick for getting revenge. With the beating he got after the sixth to eleventh punch, and the two right blows before the end, do you think he just let it happen? The second one was also a bit low, from what I hear. Not at all. It was a steady right counter. Right at the belt. The same as Max Schmeling and Joe Louis in 1938, at the Yankee Stadium in New York. It’s a historical move that those who box in a southpaw stance should study. Here, I’ll show you. Flexible legs, right? The fake left. Like this, he drops his guard. Right to the chin. Two hours later, they wake up in the locker room. Right, the locker room. It’s easy. It’s very easy. You say it's easy, but I’d like to see for myself. - I’ll show you right now. - Really? Of course. Come here. First, the guard. There, like that. There. You too. There. There you go. Now hit here. Go on. Very good. - Do you want a go? - Yes. Hit. Oh! Tough little guy. - Well, he’s my buddy. - You work out, right? - A bit of gymnastics. - It shows. Okay, right. Now, fake left, then right to the chin. - How do you do that? - Like this. Guard! Bam! Here. Guard. - Ah yes! - Easy! - My turn! - You want to see too? All right. - Guard. - Yes. Bam! And then, pow! - I’ll do it. - Go on. Quickly. Fast. There you go. - You hurt me, you jerk! - Come on. You're not a sissy, are you? I’ll show you! What’s the matter? You’re out of it! Are you completely nuts? What’s wrong with you? Hey. Where is he? Where is he? Open up, hurry. It’s me, Stanley. - Are you alone? And Barbara? - They took her. Hilda, you must help me. Count me out. Each to their own. Two people have died and I don’t want to be next. - Where are you going? - As far as possible. Do you think you’ll get far with the police around? Stanley, don’t give me up. I’ll do anything you want. Go back to Fernando right now. What for? He has no secrets with you. So, have you made up your mind? Here’s what you need to tell him. - What are you doing here? - Are you leaving? Yes. I advise you do the same. - With you? - Certainly not. - Have you chosen Irène? - Who told you about Irène? I’m well informed. If you know her, you’ll know that I want to get out of here to save my skin. We have money business to do, with a certain Mr. Stanley. I don’t have time to wait. If he wanted the plate, he should have decided before. He’s decided to negotiate. - What do you know? - I was just with him. Hello, 506? It’s personal. - Yeah? Oh, it’s you! - I need to go somewhere quiet. A nice quiet spot? There’s a work site in my neighborhood. 26 Rue du Marché, I’ll be right there. Everything going well? Swimmingly. Okay, hand over your phone. - I’m not allowed to. - Your phone. Well, okay. Miss, please do me a favor. Listen, sir, I have clients waiting. Pass on a message to a lady? Okay, I will. You have a friendly voice, but don’t overdo it. What name? Madam Irène. What number? What should I tell her? Tell her: "Phone booth at the Orsay station, ten minutes." I won’t bother you anymore. That Stanley played you. Wait a little longer. I’ve waited long enough. Hello? Yes, of course, I’m still selling. Make up your mind. I’m in a rush. In 20 minutes? Where? Yes, okay, but I warn you-- Hilda? Yes, I’ll pass you over. I think he wants to say goodbye. Hello? - Everything is set. - Does he agree? I think so. You’re in danger. Leave quickly. I put everything you need in your bag. - What? - Yes, in your bag. In my bag? Stop wasting time. Thank you, Stanley. It’s nothing. Good luck, dear. - Right on time, very good. - Okay, I’m listening. Barbara, in 15 minutes, 26 rue du Marché. Only one man with her, otherwise, no plate. Okay. You know I’m a gentleman, but any double crossing will make me forget that. Hello? Irène here. In fifteen minutes, go to 26 rue du Marché with Barbara, Just you. Don't worry, Barbara. It's all settled. - Not for me. - Are you the boss? - There's no point, I’m not armed. - That’s true. I don’t like this mess. Does he have the plate? This way. You two, get off. Come on. Yes, go ahead. Don’t bother looking, there are no stairs. If you’ve double crossed me, your friend Barbara will die in two minutes. And you, in two minutes and fifteen seconds. If you’ve told the police, you know the risks. It’s not the police, it’s the plate. Hide. This doesn’t concern you. Good Lord, it’s a habit. Put that away. Now, the plate. Do you have the dollars? Fernando. I told you to be quiet. So, you were Sacha and Michel’s accomplice? - Stay put. - Be careful. He’s so scared he might do something stupid. Traitor! You’re a coward! I’m neither a traitor, nor a coward, and you know it! I didn’t know your political history when we started or I wouldn’t have fallen for it. Fernando! Stay here! You’ll never make it to your car. My men have orders to shoot whoever leaves without me. Okay. I’ll join you. If this one’s here, it’s your fault. Fix it now. We must get rid of him. Come on, it’s now or never. - In cold blood? - Fernando! No, I can’t. I can’t. Let’s get down to business. Here’s the plate. And now, tell your shooter to let go of Barbara. Yes, all in order. Come on, let her go. Come on, let’s go. Fernando. Antoine, hurry. Show your beautiful face. Just for a second, so I can shoot it. Yes, like you did to Sacha and Michel. Exactly, kid. You know too much. I’ll make you forget. What will happen to us? Don’t worry. I know these guys. He went over there. Put an end to this. Be careful, he’s armed. Let’s get out of here! Quick! Get in. Come on. Now, tell me the truth: you’re not really a vice consul. No. I’m a friend of Lemmy Caution, but... I knew it. You three, over there. The others, follow me. Let go of me! Let’s go, I have friends waiting for me downstairs, and a lot to explain to them.
