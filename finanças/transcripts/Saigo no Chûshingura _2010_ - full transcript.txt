Farewell to this world and the night. What is one traveling toward death? Frost on the road to the graveyard. Footsteps that vanish one by one A dream within a dream, alas! Kiwa! Kiwa! Mistress Kayano! It's me! Terasaka Kichiemon! Kichie? I'm amazed you found me. I gave up samurai status, and now I eke out a living here. Squire Yoshida's wife told me the way. Squire Yoshida? So are you going around to all the families... ...of the Loyal Retainers of Ako? I've spent 16 long years walking from one to the next. You are the last. All this? Squire Oishi left it. He said with the samurai of Ako now left masterless... ...to use this money to them from falling into poverty... ...of even crime. Thank you very much! Husband! I take my leave. You are one of the 47 samurai who invaded the Kira mansion. You are supposed to be dead. But I am alive. I should probably tell you why. If was 16 years ago, on December 14th, 1702. Who's there?! Intruders! We're in the front gate. Go! I went back and forth through the fighting... ...bearing Squire Oishi's orders. And then... Lord Kira, I presume? We serve the House of Asano, of Ako, in the Province of Banshu. We are here to avenge the death of our late lord, Takumi. Savages! For honor! As we bore the head of Lord Kira to Sengakuji Temple... ...we paused at the Asa clan's residence in Takuji. You called, sir? Terasaka Kichiemon... Proceed now to Nanbu Hill in Akasaka... ...and tell Lord Asano's widow of what you have seen. Yes, sir. Then go west, to Hiroshima in the province of Geishu... ...to the Asano home there. Sir? There. But... Listen, Kichie... Your rank of foot soldier is not why I have chosen you. As messenger, you went from the front gate to back... ...all though the Kira Residence. No one else saw as much of the battle as you. Terasaka Kichiemon... ...you are to bear witness to what took place. When we have been sentenced and are dead... ...you live. You must live on. Hold your life dear. And then... ...seek out those who survive us... ...and assist them with their livelihoods. This is a vital task. Yes, sir. Now I know how the act of vengeance took place. Kichie, it's good... ...that you lived on. I've lived on because I was ordered to. The 17th-year rite for the 46 is next February in Kyoto... ...at Zuikoin Temple. I must be there to attend. Welcome! Some tea, sir. Is that a honey-locust tree? Yes, sir. An awful things. This wood's too hard and it bears no fruit. "Bears no fruit"... Just like me. Thank you. Thank you. It's a fine piece. Take care. Shall we? Magoza? Seno Magozaemon! Magoza! THE LAST RONIN I'm home! Ah, Kisuke... I heard you were coming back, so I've warmed the house. Thank you. We've taken Miss Kane in over at the house. Who's playing? Miss Kane. She's gotten better lately. Evan Yu-san can't match her now. Magoza? I'm back. You're late! You said you'd be back by sundown! I'm sorry. The rain slowed me down. Thank you as always. Not at all! How did your business go? Well... oh, my! A very rare piece. I'm pleased to have it, but it's a problem. I don't know who to sell it to. I don't know who to approach. How about Chaya Shirojiro? No, no. The likes of me... ...could never hope to approach a wealthy merchant like him. That's so beautiful! Take this to the Chaya establishment. I'm sure Shirojiro will agree to see you. Leave to enter! I am Terasaka Kichiemon, former samurai of Ako. I ask to see Lord Shindo Nagayasu. Terasaka Kichiemon... You have done well. Finding the families of the 46, and seeing to their livehood... You have had a long journey. I have merely done as Squire Oishi told me. The 17th-year rite is February 4th. Stay with us here until then. Come in! I am grateful. How many former Asano retainers will attend? 60 who now serve this house of Konoe, or in other domains. A hundred, counting those who did not seek new positions. That is a very large number. All through the good offices of Squire Kuranosuke. While it is immodest to speak well of one's second cousin... ...Kuranosuke had great depth to him. He took vengeance... ...but also planned for the future of 300 who were not involved. Such deep consideration... If I may, there is one thing I'd like to ask. What is it? About Seno Magozaemon. "Seno"? A servant to the Oishi household. The one who ﬂed the night before? On my way here, I saw a man who looked very much like him. If he is living here in Kyoto... ...perhaps word has reached Your Lordship's ear. I know nothing. Why are you so concerned with this Seno? Seno Magozaemon was a friend like no other. His family had served the Oishi's for generations. He was as close to Squire Kuranosuke as his own shadow. But the night before the vengeance, he suddenly vanished. Magoza? Where are you? Magoza! Magoza... Since last night the following have withdrawn. Oyamada Shozaemon, Nakata Riheiji... ...Suzuta Juhachi, Nakamura Seiemon, Yano Isuke... ...Seno Magozaemon. Six men! Leaving a total of 47. Perhaps Seno simply didn't want to lose his life. His wife had died young, and he had no children. Without Squire Oishi, he had no reason to live. And we had all pledged to die. But he ﬂed... I'm sorry to bring this up. But now you're in Kyoto. Find some diversion here. Ah, I know. There's a new entertainment popular here. I doubt you've seen it. The puppet theater. I have an invitation from Chaya Shirojiro. Flowers for sale! Flowers! Chaya Clothiers I'd like to see Mr. Chaya. Which Mr. Chaya? Chaya Shirojiro... The master? Would you have an introduction? Could you give him this? Mr. Kariya Magobei? And you have something to show me? This is magnificent! It's from a temple, with no documents, but it's Yi dynasty, from Korea. The Ryusen Kiln... Where did you get it? As a trader, I go west... ...to Chugoku, Sanin, and even Kyushu in search of wares. I'd prefer not to say more. Just as long as it's not stolen. Though even if it were, I'd still want it. How much? It cost me more than 50 ryo. With travel expenses and commission... ...how about 80? I was expecting thousands of ryo. You're certainly not greedy. By the way, how do you come to know Yugiri? "Yugiri"? The lady who wrote this letter. I know her as Mistress Yu. In the Shimabara quarter she was The "Courtesan Yugiri". Shimabara? The toast of the quarter? That's her. They say it was you who bought her out of there. That was long ago. But handwriting this beautiful I'd know anywhere. Lord Shindo, such a pleasure to see you. I brought someone with me. Terasaka Kichiemon You know, the survivor of the 47. Well, well, well! My name is Chaya. Terasaka Kichiemon. This is my son Shuichiro. ♪"Hatsu, is that you?

Come over here. No. I'm fine here. You used to eat beside me. Do that now. That was when you were small, to teach you table manners. I prefer that. Magoza, come close. Miss Kane, is something wrong? Magoza... ...you always keep disappearing. Well, you know... It's business. I'm sorry. I get so lonely I don't know what to do with myself. That will not do. Why not? A lady of the warrior caste must never say... ...words like "lonely" or "dear". And what should I say when I feel lonely? For that... ...nothing. Such self-indulgent thoughts must never lodge... ...in a Warrior's heart. So it's wrong to feel lonely when you're away? Yes. And I shouldn't think of you as the dearest thing in the world? That's what you used to say when you were a little girl. "Dear Magoza"... "Dear Magoza"... When I was little, I used to sleep in your arms. Magoza... ...aren't you lonely when you're away from me? Let's eat. You don't mind? You're not lonely? Magoza, answer me! Well... ...I guess I'm a bit lonely. You're just like me, then. A certain young lady? Yes. We saw her the other day at the puppet theater. A very beautiful young lady. My son fell in love at first sight. I was amazed a beauty could exist so hidden from society. But I have no idea who she is or who her people are. I see... So Mr. Kariya... ...as a dealer in antiques... ...you must know many of samurai or official status. I thought perhaps you might have some idea. No? If not... ...could I ask you to undertake to look seriously for her? If I were to find this lady... ...what might your intentions toward her be? Well... ...for generations our house has fostered such arts as... ...tea, incense, ﬂower arrangement, calligraphy... She would need the airs and graces of a cultivated woman. So she could not be a bride here simply because she was beautiful... I don't know... A proper young lady, could come to the theater... ...and sit in our box among our retainers and maids. But that's about all. Let's forget it, then. No. It's not just my son who's in love. So am I. Beauty that striking and pure... If I can have it, I want it for the House of Chaya. Well, I might come across her... ...as I go around in search of antiques. That's what I want, Mr. Kariya. That's what I ask. They want Miss Kane as a bride? Yes. That Shirojiro! He has a good eye. But... It's a fine match! Why would you hold back? Magoza... I've told you all about me being a courtesan in Shimabara. So isn't it right that you'd tell me... ...what secrets you're hiding? The fact that you won't... ...must mean it's something very serious. It was snowing that night, too, wasn't it. 16 years ago... ...when you came through the snow... ...with a baby in the fold of your kimono. I'm told that a woman here... ...just had a baby. A girl marked to a peasant nearby is back with her baby. Would she nurse this child? Her mother's dead. She'll never survive. Please! She's freezing cold! Isn't she pretty! You've raised her as if she were your own daughter. You've taught her etiquette, writing, music... ...everything. Painting and music are a courtesan's skills. I'm embarrassed I can teach them. However... ...going as a bride to the land's richest merchants. Why wouldn't you jump at the chance? Magoza... The authorities aren't after you for anything, are they? One day I swear I will tell you everything. Until then... ...forgive me. Miss Kane... ...how old are you now? What a strange thing to ask! I'm 16. Sixteen... A proper age. A proper age? Yes. Most woman marry at 15 or 16. I have no wish to go into a house of which I know nothing. I'm happy here. I can't agree to that. My orders were to see to... ...your happiness. Your orders? Yes. You raised me on orders? Does my "happiness" mean going as a bride? Miss Kane... ...your late mother... ...as she breathed her last.. ...took my hand... ...and said. "A Warrior's lot is an unhappy one." "if you can, make Kane the wife of a merchant." The head of a merchant family... ...wants you to come into his household. I won't have it.

I've been waiting here, hoping to see you again. The other time you left halfway through. I've been waiting for you to come and see the rest. What do you want? My name is Chaya Shuichiro. My family are clothiers. May I ask your name? Kane. Miss Kane? Where is your home? Miss Kane? Where is your home? I can't say. I can't say. Why not? I've been told not to. By whom? I can't say. So her name's "Kane"? Yes. That's all I know. Very mysterious. And she seems to be fond of someone. You mean she has a man? That I don't know. We have found out at least that her name is Kane. Oh. Does that name ring a bell? Not yet, I'm afraid. I'm told there's a man she's fond of. I hear you met Mr. Chaya. "Chaya"? He spoke to you at the theater. Oh, that gentleman... Chaya Shuichiro. Heir to the rich clothing merchant. Oh? He says there seems to be a man you're fond of. This man you're fond of, who might he be? I don't want to tell you. Miss Kane told you there's a man she's fond of? But she didn't want to tell me who it was. Do you have any idea? Miss Kane is in love. In love? With whom? A gentleman named Seno Magozaemon. Mistress Yu! That wouldn't happen in a million years! I've raised her since she was a baby. She's the last of a great house. That can't be right. It's absurd. I wish I could agree with you, Magoza... ...but I was raised in the red-light quarter. The face of love is something I'm never wrong about. No, you are wrong! I've carried out my orders... ...and raised her to adulthood. I've done nothing wrong. I'm not saying you have. Magoza... ...a man may live under the weight of loyalty and duty... ...and "face"... ...but a woman is born a woman, and becomes nothing else. It is her fate to burn with passion... ...for the man she loves. Fate? It's an emotion she can do nothing about. ♪"Those are human spirits."♪ ♪"That is grief you see."♪ ♪"Human spirits..."♪ ♪"...who have gone ahead."♪ ♪"Just like the spirits..."♪ ♪"...of you and me."♪ ♪"Then are those..."♪ ♪"...our two spirits?"♪ ♪"Are we dead already?"♪ ♪"But even in death..."♪ ♪"...we will be together."♪ If I get married... ...what will you do? Well... ...once you're safely married... Yes? What's your answer? Well, Mistress Yu... Mistress Yu? Maybe... ...she'd take me in and feed me. It won't bother you... ...if I'm gone. That's not true. That's different. You'll live with Mistress Yu as husband and wife... I doubt that. Have you two been talking about this behind my back?! She's had nothing to do with this. Am I in your way? You've got it all wrong! How would you be in the way? Then why can't we go on like we are? We just can't. Why? My orders were... ...to raise you... ...and get you married. So you have Mistress Yu in your heart... ls there no place for me here any more? Please understand. I am a warrior! Oh, that's right... Your heart has no room for a woman. I'd forgotten all about that. Forgive me, Magoza. "...devoid of substance. 0 Sariputra, body is void, void is body." "Form then is void, void then is form, as are feeling, sense, will, awareness." "All things are empty appearance, not born, and not destroyed." "So in void there is no form, feeling, thought, will, or consciousness." "No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, no ignorance, or its end." "No old age and death..." Hello. Some cloth... Certainly. This way, please. Sorry to keep you. For a lady's kimono? A man's. How about this cloth? Miss Kane. A man's kimono is quite difficult to sew. We could run it up for you, if you like. No. I'll sew it myself. If I may ask, what sort of man is it for? I can bring out some cloth that would suit him. He's a man of nearby 50. Fifty... He's tall... And his back... is very warm. His back... When I was a baby, he used to carry me. She's sewing a man's kimono? Yes. And he's a man of nearly 50? Not her father? I think not. Very mysterious. When will you see her? She says she'll write and let me know. Very interesting! More enticing all the time. I'm home. You're late. I was worried. I'm not a child. You needn't worry. Magoza? Yes? What is it? I want to borrow something. What? A kimono of yours. A kimono? One that's old and worn-out. By my age, a worn-out kimono is very worn-out. Miss Kane? And tomorrow I practice tea ceremony. I will go alone. Alone? Yes, alone. ♪"If my thoughts..."♪ ♪"...can reach you..."♪ ♪"...in your dreams..."♪ ♪"...then please dream of me..."♪ ♪"...as I leave this world..."♪ Miss Kane? Yes? Your palanquin is here. Thank you. Where did you unearth this? A dealer I didn't know suddenly appeared with it. And when it appeared in my house... ...my son fell in love. The son who never liked the company of women? Don't tell me the object of his attentions is... Exactly. The young lady we saw in the ﬂoor seats... at the Takemoto Theater. We know her name is "Kane". She insists we do not try to learn... ...her family name or where she lives. "Kane". That's strange. Yes, very strange. I can't help thinking this urn has brought the mystery upon us. How is this name "Kane" written? Lord Shindo, does that suggest something? "Kane"... "Kane"... Kichie, what do you think? You'd read that "Karu"? The first characters of each name are the same. Karu was... ...a girl I sent to attend on Squire Kuranosuke... ...while he was hiding out in Kyoto before the act of vengeance. What if she became pregnant by him? Squire Oishi's natural child? Yes. I have an idea as to the young lady you seek. I can't tell you everything... ...but she's the posthumous child of one who performed a valiant deed. She is? Her father died 16 years ago. Her name is Miss Kane. And where would this Miss Kane live? Well... If you know that much, you're hiding something. This Miss Kane you're interested in has no desire to be a bride. So if we rush her now the way forward might be harder. Excuse me. Welcome. Is your master here? Magoza? Whom shall I say is here? Sorry. If you're still paying respects at Lord Takumi's grave... ...then why did you ﬂee? You! You are Seno Magozaemon, aren't you not? You're still alive?! You ﬂee the night before the act of vengeance... ...and you still dare to live?! I'm very sorry. With the 17th-year rite for the 46 so close... ...how dare you show your face before this grave?! I'm very sorry. Have you no shame?! Please! Spare my life! There are things I still must do! Don't defile your sword on the likes of him. He's a disgrace! Forgive me. I've forsaken samurai status. I'm a merchant now! Forgive me! Squire Tsukioka... Damn you! Let's go. Come on. You... ...wretch! Squire! Let's be on our way. Magoza... I've been looking for you. Is there a reason you ran out on us and stayed alive? Magoza! No reason. I am a coward who simply feared for his life. What are you hiding?! What's wrong with you? If you continue in this fashion... ...I will have to kill you. Tell me why! Outside. Outside! A girl? Magoza! Why? Magoza! Tell me why you're trying to kill me! That's enough! En garde! Magoza, this doesn't make sense. What are you hiding? Magoza! Magoza! If you can hear me, listen! I've spent 16 years going around on Squire Oishi's orders! I've gone to see Ako samurai scattered all over the place! All the Ako samurai are all giving it their best! The ones who died are honored! The ones who didn't... ...aren't! "Cowards who feared for their lives." That's what people call us. We've gone through hell. We bear a lot more than the ones who died. You too, probably. 16 years... ...you've spent in hiding. There must be a reason. Right? Won't you tell me, Magoza? We're blood brothers, after all. I see. It's come to this? I won't ask again. You wanted me, sir? Magoza? Come in. The time has come. Yes. For many years... ...you've served me well. I thank you. Not at all. You are not a retainer of my late Lord Asano. You have no need to die. Rm sorry? I am ho third of my line to serve your house. I would consider it a privilege to die with you. Sir? Magoza... ...will you place your life at my service? Return to Kyoto... ...and look after Karu for me. She is ill, and pregnant with my child. The child will be treated as the offspring of a criminal. Conceal its origins, and hide it away. And... ...take care of Karu. Magoza... Yes? Forgive me. I need... ...your life. Please! As you wish. As of tonight, Seno Magozaemon is dead. I will change my appearance and my name... ...and guard... ...Mistress Karu and her child with my life! Until the time is right, tell no one of this. Neither former Ako retainers, nor your family. Yes, sir. Here is money for the way, and my formal kimono. When you must... ...use it as proof you serve the House of Oishi. I heed and will obey. This is chrysanthemum and aloe wood scent. I knew it. That is the same scent Karu favored. It must be Seno Magozaemon who has raised her child. Most likely on the orders of Squire Kuranosuke! So she is... I am Terasaka Kichiemon, former retainer to the House of Asano. Hearing you study tea ceremony here, I have taken the liberty of waiting. The House of Asano, did you say? Magoza, I'm back. Welcome home. Kichie... Magoza... ...your mission is accomplished. Well done. I came to say that. Good day. Wait! How did you know... ...about Miss Kane and me? Lord Shindo Nagayasu saw through the whole thing. I see. Kichie... My person... ...belongs to me... ...and yet it does not. As the natural child of Oishi Kuranosuke... ...what will happen to my person now? Magoza... Yes? I'll go as a bride. As you have said... ...I want to try to find happiness as a bride in the House of Chaya. I was hoping you would say that. Please be happy. What?! That Squire Oishi? The act of vengeance on Lord Kira was a high crime against the Shogun. He told me to hide the child away from the world. Miss Kane is that child. I make so bold as to ask... ...does the House of Chaya have any objection... ...to one who carries the blood of Oishi Kuranosuke? Oishi Kuranosuke was the very model of a warrior. What objection could we have to a daughter of his? Right, Shuichiro? Yes. That is good to hear. Then I convey the words of Miss Oishi Kane. Kane wishes... ...to marry Chaya Shuichiro. At last! However... "However"? Is there something else? She wishes to wait ten days. All right. We'll have the wedding in ten days.

Look after Magoza for me. I'll do that for you. I'm ready. Miss Kane... Miss Kane, you must have been lonely. I should have done more. Why would I be lonely? You were with me, after all. You're very kind. Terasaka Kichiemon, of the House of Asano. I come in the wish to serve on this auspicious occasion. Squire Terasaka you are most welcome. Ma'am! Kichie! I'm saved.

I am most grateful to you. Go in. Miss Kane, we have waited for this moment. Come in. The bride is here! Everyone, come in! Takasago! Raise the sail of our little boat... Our little boat with sail raised... With the moon rising, on the tide... Over the waves to far Awaji... Miss Kane... ...has gone safely as a bride. Now I have carried out my orders... You've come home, sir? You're back very early. Miss Kane has been delivered to the Chaya home. Mistress Yu expected you. She's prepared a celebration. Miss Kane is safely married. For that I owe everything to you. You have my deepest thanks. Why are you being so formal? It's like you're going far away. You're making me nervous. Here. Magoza... You mustn't die, you know. When I was in Shimabara I was told... ...that a woman is the only thing holding a man to this world. One hair from her head... ...keeps that man living. What has kept you tied to this world... ...was Miss Kane's hair. And now that's gone... ...you are very much in my thoughts. Your thoughts? I've always thought I was very fond... ...of Seno Magozaemon. But... Magoza... ...tell me that you are free now to live as you please. Well... You are annoying! I can't replace Miss Kane, but... ...I'm a woman. Magoza... I want you to live with me now. Magoza, I've been waiting for 16 years. That's a cruel thing to say... ...now my task is done... ...and this world has no use for me. Who's being cruel? Being tossed aside after spending 16 years? Who's being cruel? Mistress Yu, forgive me. I am a warrior. Only one man has ever resisted the charms of Yugiri. You are the only one, Magoza. Is that Lord Shindo's? Lend it to me. I have fulfilled the great task you set me. Now... ...I follow you and cast my fate to the three realms of time... ...until the end... ...of reincarnation itself. Farewell to this world ...and the night. What is one traveling toward death? Footsteps that vanish... ...one by one. A dream within a dream, alas! Magoza! Magoza! Kichie! I need no second. Magoza... You are the last of the loyal retainers! Magoza...
