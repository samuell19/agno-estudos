I didn't spend all this money on a party For you to be upset right now. I'm grateful. Of course. Could've fooled me. You act like I'm the one that spends all the money When you have a brand-new truck out front. That's different, we needed that. Okay, I just... I... I just wanted today to be... To be really nice. I just wanted... Tell me, sherri. What did you want? I just wanted you to see me. I'm sorry. Let me get a job. Please. No, you're too busy with the kids. I can contribute.

If you wanna talk. Thank you, I appreciate that. - Have a good day. - Yeah. Here you go. When you're five years... Customers love me. Get to the point. Well, I was hoping I could get a raise. Excuse me. And why should I give you one? I'm good at my job. Look, I got two kids. I see my future here. I wanna work hard for you. I'm proud of my job. And we're proud to employ you, keith. You know that. But I can't just give you a raise. Okay? Times are tough. I hope you can understand where I'm coming from, keith. Honey? Kids? Hello? Guys? What is going on? Sherri, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Pick up. Hi. It's, uh, keith papini calling. I was just going to call you. Sherri never came to pick her up. What? I tried calling sherri, but she didn't pick up. Uh, I'll have my mom pick her up right away. Come on, come on. No. No, no, no, no, no. It's my wife. It's my wife. I can't... I can't find my wife. I need somebody here now. I found her phone. It's got her hair ripped out. It... it's in her headphones, and I... Okay, okay. Headphones are untangled. No signs of a struggle. They seem untouched. Placed, not thrown. Mr. Papini? I'm molly rowlands. This is anthony bertain. I'm the lead detective on this case. And you found the headphones just like this? I didn't touch anything. I think it would be best if we spoke at your house. Yeah. Okay. "can you please come home for some sex with your wife?" Was this the last text That you received from mrs. Papini? It was, yeah. Was it normal for her to send texts like this to you? Um... Sure, yeah. Lucky guy, I guess. Did she have any enemies? No. I have no idea Why something like this would happen. No idea? Nope. Well, if no one had the motive to kidnap her, We'd have to look at other options. Mr. Papini, this may be hard for you to hear, But redding has a trafficking problem, She could've been a good target. Wha... What are you telling me? It's possible your wife was kidnapped And coerced into forced labor or sexual exploitation. Did she have an issue with mental health? Wha... Wh... what do you mean? Did she suffer from... Depression? Bipolar disorder? Schizophrenia? Drug addiction? Anything that might explain a sudden change in behavior, An altered ability to make a good decision? I mean, she'd get anxiety, but only sometimes. Can you tell me more? She'd get overwhelmed, and she'd cry. She wasn't... Crazy. Look, whatever happened, Sherri would never leave the kids, Not like this. Somebody did this to us. My kids. My kids are at my mom's house. Can they... Can they come home, or...? Yeah. We're done for today. Wha... what do I tell them? I guess you can't tell me. Wake up, sleepy-head. Come here. Where is mommy? Um... Mommy is... Uh, I need to tell you two something, And I need you to listen. Okay? Honey, sit down. Your mom has... Gone on a trip for a few days, But she'll be back soon. A trip? Just a... A little getaway. With who? Just by herself. She just wanted to clear her head. Um, but she told me to tell you That she loves you guys very much, And, uh, she misses you. Now, I think... Do we have everything? We gotta go. We gotta go. - Okay? - Okay. Welcome home. It's nice. Kids, we gotta go! Kids! All right, here we go. make sure you check the trees over there. yeah, we're going to go this way, over here. Sherri! Yell "sherri", everyone. She could've easily just been... Snatched? I know. I know. I was thinking the exact same thing. Or disposed of. A beautiful, blonde, missing white woman. Looks good on tv. He's hiding something. He was evasive during questioning. The only thing we found on her phone Was that she was texting some man That she'd saved under a woman's name. They never met up, just some light flirtation. Guy's alibi totally checks out. We have no other suspects. What do you think, she just vanished into thin air? We've got video proof of his alibi. Also airtight. He was at work. His bosses handed over the videos immediately. Our entire community Is dedicated to bring sherri home. We proved that here today. I don't know how I'd be able to keep going without you all. We're gonna find my wife! I got you something. You remembered. Yeah. Well, it was your favorite for years. I don't think that keith ever remembered My favorite ice cream. I miss my kids so much. Do you promise that we'll go and get them? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. As soon as we can. Really. I can't live without them. As soon as we can. I'm a terrible mother. No one knows what you've been through, Except me. You stayed so long for those kids. My whole life has just been, like, one person... Bad person after another bad person. I mean, I can only blame myself, right? I should never have married him. Sherri... You told me your mother beat you. You were set up to fail. Look, it's time to start trusting yourself again. Son, we need to talk. Now, I know things were... Are complicated with my daughter, But it doesn't mean I don't love her. I know things have been bad between sherri and I, but... Look, we don't need to talk about this right now. You're right. There will be time for that. I brought dinner. Shit. I got it. I got it, I got it. It's all right, guys. It's okay. It's all right. Why is mommy's mom still here? Grandma is here to help us through this difficult time. So, we're gonna sit down like a family And eat the dinner she so kindly prepared. Just try it, please. Kids! Come here. Come here. I'm gonna tell you a little story. Okay? When your mommy was little, She used to ask me so many questions. All the questions, all the time. And one day I said to her, "sherri, if you ask me one more question, I'm gonna cut your tongue off." Oh, it was funny. You were the most beautiful girl in high school. And you're still The most beautiful girl in the world. It's been so long Since I've heard nice words like that. You're gonna be hearing them every day. We're together. I'm so tired. Can I go to sleep now, chris? Yeah, of course, my pet. I love you. Would it be okay if I sleep alone? Yeah. Okay. I want you to be comfortable. Thank you. Of course. I'll go. Sweet dreams. You too. I'll step in If they ask you something that could be incriminating. Will they do that? That's their whole m.O.. Glad I have you. Keep it simple. Emotions are good, but don't go overboard. Everyone's looking for you to make a wrong move. Just tell your truth. Keith, your wife has been missing for five days. I know she was taken. My family knows she was taken. But they can't come out, obviously, and say "abduction" Because they don't have the evidence. I mean, that was hard to hear, but... I'm coming, honey. I'm trying. I'm doing everything I can. And... I love you. And if the sheriff's office won't find my wife, I will. most people don't agree to this. I've got nothing to hide. Keith, did you kill your wife? Absolutely not. Do you know where sherri is? No. keith passed the lie-detector test With flying colors. I'm really worried about her health. And... Are they feeding her? Is she hot? Is she cold? These are the horrible things that I go through, That I think about. And I imagine... I imagine her screaming my name, and... I'm not there. I'm not there, and... I don't know, I just... It's hard... it's hard to handle. That was great. This should air very shortly. This was a good one. Really. Amazing work, keith. keith's relationship with sherri Is a rare love story dating back to childhood. A storybook beginning Starting with a seventh-grade kiss. When they reconnected years later, They fell head over heels. I was head over heels for this girl. I knew... I knew I was gonna marry her. Daddy? Can I sleep with you? Of course, you can, honey. Come here. I love you. I love you, too. Mr. Papini. You need to find my wife! We are working with the fbi. We're doing everything we can. I know that's what you're supposed to say. I... I've got babies. They're crying themselves to sleep every night. It's been ten days. I know what happens to women when they go missing. For every day, the more likely she... Mr. Papini, believe me When I say I am doing everything I can. But when you talk to inside the headlines And not us... I have told you everything I know. I'm not lying. I just want to be on the same team. Okay? Is it enough... Everything you're doing? I hope so. the case is captivating media. Where is sherri? The nation is obsessed With what happened to sherri papini. As the search continues... Breakfast? Yes, please. You have to wonder, Will they ever find out the real truth? How did you sleep? In the spare room? Spent the night dreaming of you. You remind me of how I used to be. Happy and loved. Chris, do you think that we can go outside today? I need some fresh air. It's probably best if we just stay here. Stay safe. It's just that I'm feeling, um, stir-crazy. I thought that you said this place was big. It's the biggest place I've ever had. I thought that there was a backyard. There's a large deck. Yes. Look... Don't worry, baby. This is a starter home, okay? Okay. It's just the beginning. Yeah? Okay? Get some breakfast. - Okay. - Just stay here. - Okay. - Okay. Sherri, I love you. I'm gonna find you. I... I love you so much. I miss my wife so much. I... I just wanna hold her again.

I will go back in and keep distracting them. You do exactly what you are doing. Keep fighting. Stay strong. I don't know how much longer I can be strong for.

I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd stop by. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, man. Um, now is not a great time. Hey, can I... can I use your can? I really gotta piss before hockey. It's occupied right now. Occupied? Oh, my god, did you get a girlfriend? Yeah. Yep. Yep. She's super shy, And she's not ready to meet anyone yet. So, I gotta get back. I'll leave you two lovebirds alone. yeah. I appreciate it. see you after the honeymoon phase. see you soon, bud. Yeah. You shouldn't be out here. It's the middle of the night. But still... I just needed some fresh air. What's going on? My mom came back. How do you feel? I never thought she'd come back. She seemed sorry. Like... Really, really sorry. I made a horrible mistake. What? I made a horrible mistake. This place isn't what you promised it to be. You hate your mom. I never hated my mother, I thought that she hated me, okay? What about keith? This is not about keith. I need to get back to my kids immediately, And I need to go home. I cannot sit here in a two-bedroom apartment And die. Do you love me? Of course, I do. We just need to make it look like I was really kidnapped. You understand? How do we make it look like you were really kidnapped? Do it! I deserve it. I need you to hurt me. Do it. Hurt me. More! Again! I can't keep hurting you. More! More! Sherri, what the hell are we doing? It's our secret. It's our secret, okay? Hey... Can I say our poem? I want to be your love forever, Without a break or decay. When the hills are all flat, And the rivers run dry. When the hills are all flat, And the rivers run dry. Help me! Help me, please!

Hello? Hi. I just picked up a woman off the side of the highway. What's your name, sweetheart? Sherri. - What's your name, sweetheart? - Sherri. Sherri. Oh, my god, you're sherri papini. Sherri papini. I was kidnapped. I was kidnapped. I was kidnapped. Hello? keith, we found your wife. What? Where is she? Keith, wait. Just listen. Seeing her is gonna be difficult. Where is she? We performed a rape and narcotics test on her. We're running her clothes through dna. I wanna see my wife! Third floor. Oh... Sherri, who... Who did this to you? Sherri... I love you. Talk to me. Say something. Keith, I missed you so much. I'm so glad this is finally over. I'm gonna spend the rest of my life Making you happy. I can't believe I have you back. It's like seeing a ghost. I'm here. I'm right here. Mrs. Papini, if you don't talk to me, We won't be able to find out who did this to you. I'm sorry. I want to talk, I just... I'm sorry. I just need to ask you a few questions. If you can answer them, We can try to find out who did this to you. Sherri? You know, you and I have a lot in common. Maybe more than you think. That's why I'm so determined to solve this case. You grew up without a lot. So did I. In fact, I grew up just two neighborhoods away from you. I'll only talk to my husband. I'll speak with my husband. Please? Please, just so... I need him. I'll only speak with him. The people that took me said they used to be cops. dr. Anderson to x-ray. Dr. Anderson to x-ray. Just tell me what happened, the best you can remember it. I was jogging. When out of the blue, Two mexican women in a van pulled over. They snatched me. They put a bag over my head. They tied my wrists. And they drove me away. It was two women? Yes. Two women. They said that they used to be law enforcement. Can you describe them at all? Yes. The younger one, she had on large hoop earrings, And had hairy arms. And she seemed more... Reluctant. And the older woman, She was mean, And had thin eyebrows. They were both mexican. What else do you remember about your time in the van? Not that much. I would never leave our children. They tried to kill me. Um... Sherri, what can you tell us about the drive there? They took me by gunpoint to the van. And when they were dragging me, I took out my earphones with some of my hair, And I left it on the side of the road with my phone For you to come find me, baby. You did that for me? Of course, I did. I knew that you would come find me. You're my hero. You're my big, strong hero. Okay. Okay, I think we need to stop. Now. Women almost never kidnap other women. And former cops? What could the possible motive have been? I can't see one. mr. Papini! Mr. Papini! How is sherri? Did she say who did it? We are overwhelmed with joy With how supportive everyone has been Bringing our family together again. Everyone's tireless efforts Has made our family whole for thanksgiving. And that... Thank you for allowing our family time to heal. sherri papini, can we ask you a few questions? What is the description of the abductors? Mommy! - Mommy! - It's okay. It's okay. I love you both so much. It's okay to be sad. Our family were meant to be together. hi, sherri. Hi, mom. I'm glad you're home. Me too. I want you to know, I... I did what I thought was best. I... I love you, sherri. I'm so sorry, sherri. I should've paid more attention to you. I wasn't a very good husband. I love you so much. And I miss you so much. I just want us to be happy. What we have is really special. I will fight for that for the rest of my life, I promise you that. I'm never gonna lose you again. I want to be your love forever, Without a break or decay. When the hills are all flat, And the rivers run dry. Our vows. I love you so much. Not as much as I love you. Dna came back. No female dna found on any of her clothes, But there was male dna found on her underwear. And it's not keith's. Who does it belong to? No match yet. We'll keep searching every week, but... At least it's something. People in the latino community are living in fear. What's your point? That we need to find out who did this. And not just for her safety. What's on your mind? I know you already said no, But we're getting a lot of offers For exclusive interviews. Keith, I can't... I know. I know. And it... it was... It was really hard on me, And I can't imagine what it would be like for you, But... It could be a lot of money. And... And we could set the terms. I don't think I could get through it. You understand, right? Of course, I do. I'm so happy to be back with you. Sherri, that money could really help us. When I was... Chained up, And using kitty litter as a bathroom, I thought when I came home, That all of our problems would just seem stupid. And I was wrong. I just want the rest of our lives to be easy. That's... That's all I want. What about the gofundme money? Like, couldn't we use that? For us? For... for our debts, for our bills? Like, that's it. Yeah, maybe. I want you. You... Are you sure? Are... are you ready? Yes. Okay. There's something I wanna show you first. Okay. What is... This? They branded me. They should be burned alive. Both of them. "exodus"? I looked it up. It's a story in the bible about freed slaves. Oh... It's okay. All that matters is that I'm back with you. Kiss me. Please. You're mine forever. Yeah. Yeah. Hi. I hope you like cookies. Thanks for coming in. I know it's hard for you when keith is working. It's okay. Is detective bertain here? I'm the detective on the case. I lead the questioning. Have a seat, please. Okay, so... Why don't you tell me how your day started? I'd hardly sleep. They... They... They kept me in a closet. They had me chained. They would let me relieve myself in kitty litter. And, if I was lucky, They would let me take a shower. But I'd... I'd really like to focus on today. Molly... You know, I finally have my dignity. I'm not a hero, But, I'm... I'm thankful. I'm really thankful for my freedom. When you were being driven to the place you were held in, Did you hear anything on the radio? They played mariachi music. Did you hear any ads in between the music? If it was something local, it might help pin down your... Where your location was. They spoke spanish, and I didn't... I didn't understand what they were saying. You've lived in california your whole life. You don't understand any spanish? No. They fed me rice and tortillas. They... Went with me when I went to the shower. And they chained me to a pole. They let you shower, But they made you use the bathroom in kitty litter? They tased me. They tased me, and, um, My brain just... It doesn't work the same. It's... I have, um, trouble putting all the pieces together. You know? That's what you're saying happened? I... I'm really sorry. I just... I... I can't remember it all. Sorry. You feel okay... Being out here? Yeah. People are curious. I can understand why. I'm so sorry, but are you sherri papini? Yes. Told you. We just wanted to tell you how much we admire you. You really woke us up. It's not so safe in perfect redding anymore. What kind young women you are. Well, if I can make this place safer for one woman, Then I guess My horrible experience was worth it. Well, we'll let you keep eating. Oh, thanks. I'm loretta, by the way. Sherri's mother. We're so sorry for you, too, ma'am. Thank you. Do you know what they call them? Tragedy groupies. I've been meaning to talk to you about something. Um... I know the press wants to do an exclusive with you. I know it's a lot of money. Investigative journalists, they ask... They ask tough questions. They're waiting for a... A "gotcha" moment. Mom... I'm sorry. I just... I want you to know, If there is anything that you wanna tell me... Anything, I... I'm here to listen. What kind of thing would I need to tell you? I remember everything... That happened between us. Every single thing. Keith... Seven years. This last year was the hardest of our lives, But we made it. We were put back together, because we're meant to be. I love you. I love you, baby. Cheers! Cheers. Congratulations. I can't tell you both How much your friendship has meant to me During this terrible, terrible time. Of course, sherri. We'll always be there for you. When I was with those other women, It was so awful. And you couldn't fight them off? No. They were, like... Huge. Like, heavyset. There was... there was no way. But the police description Said that they weren't much bigger than you. That's the thing, you know? They ask you, like, do all these sketches, And all these things, And it's just... They make mistakes. I just... Did you like the cake? - Yeah, it was great. - Yeah? You were married to sherri for how long? Uh... Five years. I was deployed for most of it. And now? I'm a veteran. I served in iraq and got an honorable discharge. Our marriage was a lie. I was her friend. I married her Because she said she needed my medical insurance. Why did she need your medical insurance? First, she said it was a heart murmur. Then, she said she needed medical attention Because she'd repeatedly donated her eggs. She repeatedly donated her eggs? Why? She said it was for the money. And the truth is, I... I have no idea. I don't even know if that's true. You can't trust a word she says. She lies about everything. You know, small things that didn't matter. Huge things that did matter. Can you give me concrete examples? She used to claim that her mom, loretta, Would beat her, And then lock her in the basement. That's the thing I just couldn't stop thinking about When all this started. It's, like, "how different is that Than what's happening right now?" Why are you coming forward now? I saw your press conference. I struggled with this decision. Sherri... She's a part of my past. A part that I don't want to revisit, But a part, nonetheless. Why should I believe you? What do I got to lie about? I'm embarrassed by all this. We called you here today about the papini case. Due to the tremendous national interest, We are here to make a statement. And it goes as follows... This investigation is far from over. In fact, it's just begun a new chapter. Welcome to a meeting for survivors... For women-in-arms who suffer with ptsd. I feel so lucky to be leading this group today. United, we can find strength again. Would anyone like to share? I'd like to share. Go ahead. I just wanted to ask When I'm gonna feel normal again. I... I... I know there aren't timelines, or anything, But everything just feels so surreal after my assault. And I feel hyper-vigilant. Like, I always need to know what's... What's behind me. Even if I know there's nothing there. "being white is more than just being aware of my skin, But of standing behind skinheads, Who are always around in spirit, as well, And having pride for my country. Being white is my family, my roots, my way of life. It's always there. There's no denying it. It's nobility. It's strength." Sherri wrote this? Using her maiden name, graeff. Where'd you find it? After scouring the dark corners of the internet, I need a shower. Hey. First, we gotta find out if this is real. A young latino guy just got jumped And he's in the hospital. I think she wrote it. I think it's meaningful. This has hurt a lot of people in the community, anthony. Specifically people that look like me. You know there's been an increase in hate crimes. I think it's linked. I hear you, but we still need a smoking gun. Would anyone else like to share? Go ahead. What happened to me hurt a lot of people. Specifically my family and my children. People are saying that I'm a hero, but I'm not. I'm just a regular woman. And, um... Like amy said, it's... It just all feels surreal. Hi. How tall were they? Who? The girls who took you. How tall were they? Taller than me. I don't remember exactly. I don't know. You don't remember anything else about their faces? Not from what I said. I've said everything already. It's kinda weird. You were staring at them for three weeks. Did they say anything? They talked about my brand... Exodus. Wait, they talked about your brand in english, But everything else was in spanish? Yes, keith. They did. Are you sure? Sherri, you don't remember anything else at all? I'm traumatized... And all of this is very surreal. And I'm hyper-vigilant. Come on, sherri. Don't! There are things I'm remembering, right... Horrible things... From when they took me. And every time You just keep asking me a question Over and over and over again, I have to keep reliving it! I wanna forget it! Sherri, we can't just forget it. It happened to us. But... Sherri, I'm here. Talk to me. Let me help. What things are you remembering? No. I'm not ready. Well, then we have to go to the police. I cannot keep reliving These horrible, horrible memories Over and over and over again. Please! We don't have a choice! Because if we don't stop these bitches, They're gonna do it to somebody else. And I can't live with myself knowing that. I am not... Going... To the police! I remembered some things that happened to me. We were talking. I told her she had to come in. Even though that this is hard, I think that it's the right thing to do. I remember... Um... Being chained to the closet, Going to the bathroom in the kitty box. And I remember the other woman... The older woman... Hitting me so hard. What about the...? Oh. And, um... When they were branding me, They said something about exodus. It's a story about freed slaves in the bible. Tell her about that younger one. Keith, I'm gonna ask That you let sherri share what she remembers. I just want to get your version of the story, sherri. Just your version alone. I'll, uh... I'll go wait outside. Mrs. Papini, do you know... A mr. David dreyfus? Yes. Haven't thought about him in a while, but yes. Well, he's been thinking about you. He paid us a visit And shared us Some very interesting information about your past. Do you know what you're looking at? No. It's a police report... From your mother. She claimed that you were abusing yourself And blaming it on her. Sherri, is there anything else you wanna tell us? No, ms. Rowlands. Thanks for coming. You know sherri papini? Uh, look, I don't wanna get anyone in trouble. No one's going to get into trouble, If they didn't do anything illegal. We just want to figure out what happened. We need your help. It's an opportunity for you to do some good. For the whole community. I don't know her. She was engaged to my cousin. Can you confirm If this is a picture of your cousin, chris? You promise he won't get in trouble? I can't make any promises. But it's a crime to lie to me. I saw sherri at chris' place. When she was reported missing? And this is him? Yeah. Why didn't you come forward earlier? Would you have? I wanted to stay out of the whole thing. Dang, is this 'cause I did 23andme? She's the love of my life. I need you to know that. Anything I did, I did because of that. We were together when I was younger. And I knew then that I wanted to marry her. But I was too immature, so she left. When she said that she needed my help... It felt heaven-sent, you know? I was finally gonna get my girl back. How long were you and mrs. Papini in touch for? Before she alleges her kidnapping? Six months. Can you tell me about the day of her disappearance? I should have known then that it wasn't gonna... Go the way that I planned it. We were talking on burner phones. Sherri, come on. We gotta get going. I'm saving our asses, okay? Where's your car? I rented the van. What were you thinking? I was excited. I wanted to see you. Wake up, sleepy-head. How'd she spend her time here? she cleaned. A lot. I think being stuck here got pretty old for her pretty quick. I don't know what she did all day, But when I got home from work, She'd be watching tv. the nation is obsessed With what happened to sherri papini. I gotta ask you, What was the plan? I keep asking myself that. I really don't think there was a plan. What did you think was happening? I thought she was in an abusive marriage. I thought her husband beat her. There's something I need to tell you. There's no evidence that keith or loretta ever beat sherri. There's only evidence that she has a pattern of... Deceitful behavior. So it was all... It was all a lie? Most likely. You know, the strangest thing is I'm not mad at her. I can't bring myself to hate her. I know I should... But I still love her. I know she's mixed up. But I really wish She'd just allow herself to get mixed up with me. Am I gonna be arrested? That is up to the d.A.. But having a married woman run away with you Is not illegal. It's just stupid? Yeah. Keith? Babe, will you get it? Keith? That was the police. They sound excited. I think they found them. Yeah, yeah, we'll be right there. Hello. Thank you. As you both know, This has been a long and arduous investigation. But we are here today To share that we think we have found the culprit. What? You found them? Who? Who did this to my wife? You recognize this man? No. No, I... I told you that it... It was such a difficult time, it's really hard to remember. Well, that's interesting, sherri, Because we have an eyewitness That says they saw you at this man, chris', apartment, When you were supposed to be missing. Chris? Her ex-boyfriend, chris? He did this? Chris did this? Actually, keith, no. We have proof that she ran away with him voluntarily. No. Then what happened, sherri? I don't know. It was such a difficult time. I don't remember. This wasn't a kidnapping. Chris thought that he was in a romantic relationship With sherri for the last six months. During that six months, They plotted, spearheaded by sherri, In faking her kidnapping. Is this... is this true? No. No. It was two women that did this to me. It was two women. I found dna on your underwear That is a direct match to chris'. How do you explain that? I don't know, But there's no way that chris did this. There is no way. There's no way. I spoke to chris. He admitted to everything. He also said that you told him keith beat you. What? You said I beat you? Oh, my god. Sherri... Why? I need to speak to a lawyer. I'm sorry. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith! Keith! "my skin is my pride. I lunged at those latino women who called me a nazi And beat them until they bled." Did you write this? I've never seen that. I think you have. I think you wrote it. Mrs. Papini, not only have you ruined your family, But your racist behavior has damaged redding forever. You stole precious resources away from real victims. I am a victim. Stand back. Ready? - Thank you. - Thanks! - Thanks. - Thank you.

Oh. ♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪ ♪ gently down the stream ♪ On the move. Sherri papini, you're under arrest. My kids... You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. Stop! You have the right to an attorney. - If you cannot afford one... - Stop! - One will be provided for you. Call my husband. Call my husband.

Stop lying. I'm not lying. Sherri, come on. Do you not understand what it's like, Waking up every day more and more invisible? To go to bed at night just hoping that the morning... Something will change? That the man that you fell in love with Will somehow, somehow see you again? Do you know what that feels like? Do you? You're a black hole. Nothing will ever fill you. No matter how many people pity you. How many men you text. How many lives you've ruined. People ruined my life. I'm the victim. Goodbye, sherri. No. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please, don't go. Please. Please! Sherri papini wasted $150,000 of city resources That should have gone to real victims. Redding, you can go back to sleeping easy. We're a safe, diverse community, That was victim To what I think is a woman Who probably just wanted some attention. Because of our hard work, All of us, We can go back to living together peacefully. Thank you. No further questions. Don't say anything that could get you into trouble. I know exactly what to say. - Sherri, did you do it? - Sherri, why did you do it? What about your family? What about your community? Back off. Sherri! Sherri! Is it true that you faked it? All of it? You've seen much dishonor laid before you in this room. People who... Are not willing to... To walk through the shame, To say that they are guilty. I'm not one of them. I am guilty of lying. I am guilty of dishonor. I stand before you Willing to accept, repent, and concede. I trust in this court. I trust in the... Officers handling my release. And I trust in you, your honor, To see me, And hear me. I am choosing to... To not stay frozen, Like I was in 2016. I am committed... To healing the parts of myself That were so very... Broken. And... To humbly accept... Responsibility. Sherri papini. I am sentencing you to 18 months in prison And 36 months supervised probation Upon release. You are ordered to pay More than $300,000 in restitution. You would probably still be telling lies If you hadn't been caught. You can begin serving your sentence in three months. So, what comes to mind? I've always wanted to go to therapy. Then it's good you're here. This can't be an easy time for you. You've lost your reputation, Your marriage, Your children. How do you feel about your actions, sherri? God doesn't give you more than you can handle.
