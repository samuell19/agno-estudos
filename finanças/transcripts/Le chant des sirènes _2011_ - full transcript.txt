SIREN SONG Revolt by "Thatcher's children" We will shortly be arriving at the Gare du Nord. Have you got a cigarette? Thanks. I'm Samia. Auditioning is going to be tricky if you're dumb. Where are you from? I'm from Paris. Well, the suburbs really. In the north. I bet you're from the south. You southerners sing so well. Go on, sing something. Abbeville. Where I come from. Abbeville. A village near there. Is that in the south? Picardy. There can't be much to do there. Don't you get bored? Do you know the words? I'll sing it for you. It's a time for love, a time for friends and for adventure As time comes and goes you think nothing of your wounds At 20 we think we rule the world And that forever more our eyes will reflect nothing but blue sky It's a time for love, a time for friends - Go on, carry on. - No. Go on. How will you cope in front of the panel? That's different. It's their job. You're sweet. It's a time for love, a time for friends And for adventure As time comes and goes you think nothing... Because the time for love Is long and it's short At 20 we think We rule the world And that forever more Our eyes will reflect Nothing but blue sky It's a time for love It's a time for love, a time for friends And for adventure As time comes and goes You think nothing Or your wounds For life takes its course... For the time for love Is long and it's short It's still going on I remember it well Cheer up. There will be other auditions. You were good. Everyone gets a chance here, unlike in North Africa or Picardy. What will you do now? Where will you sleep? I don't know. My foster mother phoned one of her friends. Don't you have any family? They're not really my family. Social services placed me with them. Don't you have any parents? Don't you have any brothers or sisters? You're not missing much. Well? - Well what? - Where will you sleep? A friend of my mother's runs a restaurant. He'll give me a room if I work weekends for him. - So you're staying in Paris? - Yes. Yes, I want to go to other auditions. What time are you meeting this guy? - He said not before ten. - I'll take you to my acting class. It's great. You'll see. Hey, come on! It's very important. - Excuse me. - Yes. - He's come to see what it's like. - Come in. Come and see, new boy. In real life a man who is angry cannot be limp. When the anger is contained the body is completely rigid. If the anger explodes, he explodes. The body follows suit and the gestures become erratic and externalised. What is a thinking body like? What is a body in love like? Are you bored? Just say if you are. A body in love, wanting to keep that love secret. A lying body. What do your hands do when you lie? Or your feet when you're impatient? That's an easy one. Everyone in position. Let's move onto the exercises. Let's link the four exercises. First, the kitten. Next, the noisy children who might frighten the kitten. Then we try to shoo away the dog. And finally we hit all the tennis balls. Let's go. So, the little hoop... We approach the cat and try to get it to jump through. 30 screaming kids. The tennis balls are coming at you. Hit them. Great. Go back to your seats. - All except you. - Me? Acting is like going for a midnight swim on New Year's Eve. Getting in the water is hard, but then you don't want to come out. You just have to dive in. So what I suggest you do here and now with us is dive in. And if the water is too cold, the shore isn't far away. Great. Right, then... Introduce yourself Don't use your real name. Use your stage name. If you don't have one, make one up. And then introduce your act. Something simple. All that matters is that you feel it and that you make us feel that it's the best act in the world. Great. Take off your hat and dive in. Some encouragement. - Grégory. - Louder. - My name is Grégory. - Great. What are you going to do for us? - I'm going to sing a song for you. - Great. It's a song I wrote for Grégory Lemarchal. - You know, the boy who died... - Never mind that, Grégory. Perform your act. Remember, it's the best act ever. Go on. You my friend who is no more How to describe what you once were Now I am all alone My tears taste of you If my blood had flowed in you If your blood had flowed in me You and I would have been brothers Our hearts beating in unison Would have sung of life Would have sung of joy We would be forever united One heart, one mind You don't know it but you live Breathe, sing and write Every word that I say Every word that I write You are my soul which is no more Good. Well, on a positive note, you dived in. There's no need for that. Grégory! My name's not Grégory. Have you got any change? Have you got a cigarette? Good evening. I'm looking for Fernand. Gisèle sent me. I'm Fernand. Have you eaten? We'll see what's left. Then I'll show you your room. You're too early. Go and sit over there. Here, give me your bag. I'll put it behind the counter. While you're eating watch how it's done. Michel, see what's left for the boy. How did the audition go? Not great. Never mind. What you need is a real job. I'll give you one if you're any good. Here, the key to your manor. See you tomorrow. Hurry up. People are waiting. Watch out! Not here, you idiot. That goes in the sink. Get out of the way! Go on, go on! Go on. What are you wearing? Take that off. The inspectors may show up any minute. Go and put a white shirt on. What was Fernand thinking of? If we do get inspected, say you're a member of the family. You wanted to learn the trade so we're showing you the ropes. Do you understand? Go and change. You can have a sneaky cigarette. You can wash up afterwards. - I don't have a shirt. - So buy one. Right now you're just getting in the way. Don't buy a checked one. We're not cowboys. No, take the glasses off and start with the plates. Then you can put things on top of them. No, it's fine. The auditions are being held just next to the restaurant. You're on washing-up duty, not reception. Give her my love and get your arse back in there. I've got to go, Mum. Lots of love. - That's just the way it is. - Who cares about Fridays? You know Friday is a day of rest in this house. I must be going mad. Put that glass away. We're not your maids. Who does he think he is? We always have couscous on Sundays not Fridays. My idiot brother can't change that. Samia! - This is nonsense. - What do you want me to do? - Stop him seeing these people? - Yes. You're his mother and he's a minor. At this rate those bearded bastards will take him to Pakistan or Afghanistan. I know. I keep telling him. - Dad should tell him too. - Your father? In a crown court it is the jury and magistrates who pass the sentence. Hey, keep the noise down! Red loses. Black, red, red, black. Where is the black card? Where is the black card? Did you spot it? Here. Give me 20. Turn the card over. It's red. You lost. Too late. This gentleman has already turned over the card. Where is the black card among the red cards? Roll up, roll up. This could be your lucky day. Watch. Keep your eyes peeled. Watch the black card. It pays double. Red loses. Let this gentleman through. Watch this. This black card pays double. Red, red and red. Where is the black card? Go on, for free. Turn over the card. This one? Turn it over. Give me 20 and I'll give you 40. Imagine that. Let's do it again. Watch this. I'll take this black card. Red loses. Watch this, sir. Keep your eyes peeled. Where is the black card? - There. - Get lost. - There. - 20. There. Turn the card over. 20 plus 20 makes 40. You've won. There's 40. I'll pay you. This is the house of fortune. It's just like a bank. We pay cash. Here's the black card. Red loses, black wins. The black card is here. Can you see it? I throw it down. Where is it? Did you spot it? 40. 40. Give me 40. Turn over the card. I'll pay you 40 plus 40 to make 80. 80. I'm paying you what I owe. This is your lucky day. Time to go. A debt paid is a friend kept. I'll give you 160 if you find the card. Here's the black card. Down it goes. Where is it? All or nothing. 160. Give me 80. Police, police! Get out of here! Nice one, mate! Up yours! You can certainly pack a punch. - Well, Eric? - You've got what it takes. You saved our skins, kiddo. Cheers. You made a mess of your hand. Where did you learn to fight? At the orphanage I had to defend my plate of food. - That instinct stayed with me. - What do you do? - I'm looking for work. - Long-term? I wait on tables for bed and board but the pay's crap. I can get you a job. We work in a security firm. Here. Come and see me tomorrow. We always need more men. And from time to time we need someone with a bit of spunk. Can I get you a drink? Shit. I can't... - I just got ripped off. - You, ripped off? - Tell us. - It was stupid. It was a card game on the street. - I was winning... - Bonneteau. - What? - Never heard of Bonneteau? You'll learn to recognise it. Give me 20. Pay me and I'll pay you 40. - That was good. - I barely recognised myself! - Hi. - Hi. - My best friend, Sophie. - Hi. - Is that yours? - No. Sorry about last time. Those posh kids are so ignorant. The teacher was asking for you. She asked if you'd be back. - She's smart, unlike them. - We have to go. Yes. I can't tonight but if you like we could meet tomorrow. Or the day after. Are you OK? Have you started your job? Is the room nice? Come on, Samia. Look, give me your number. I'll add it to my contacts and call you. You don't have a phone? OK. Call me, whenever you like, and we'll... - Right. - Come on. Bye. - Hi. How's it going? - Hi. I need tough guys for tomorrow. It should be right up your street. - Fancy it? - Sure. See you at seven at the office and don't be late. - Right. - Bye. Bye. - Prices keep on rising. - Where will it lead? It's the slippery slope, believe me. - You don't fix the prices, do you? - No. It's the taxes, and what do they go on? They pay for child benefit. And income support, and healthcare for foreigners who come and take advantage of our generosity. France is a very generous country. The money would be better spent on the elderly. At least you've still got a pension. Are you banking on getting one? I've worked all my life. It's hard enough to make ends meet with what we earn... Out with the fascists! Here come the faggots. This should be fun. - France for the French! - Ignore them. They're the intolerant ones. Look at those proud defenders of democracy. They love their freedom so let's protect it for them. No one has ever stopped France from advancing. Let's go. Make way for France, please. - Down with the National Front! - Out of our way. What are you doing with these arseholes? - I'm working. - Have you seen who for? - Walk on! - Walk on, you meek little lamb! - Walk on! - Out with the fascists! Just ignore her. She's not the girl for you. She's not in the culture. Do I have to spell everything out? Come to the Parc later. - The Parc? - The Parc des Princes. The football stadium. I can't. I have a date. You're a fast mover. Walk towards me. Again, please. Try to make it more... original and sensual. Raise an arm perhaps. Put a hand on your hip. Turn round. Turn on the spot. Smile. What are you doing with your arms? Try to understand, Sonia. It's Samia. That will do. You can get dressed. Thank you. That's the end of that. Never mind. - If your brother could see you now! - Don't be stupid! Leave the underwear behind. Of course. Hi. How's it going? - Shall we go? - Yes. I'm beginning to think I'll never get a part. They all go to the friends and family of people in the industry. They're all so sure of themselves and what they're entitled to. The worst thing is, they're good. They've got nothing to fear so they can act natural. Meanwhile we're freaking out since no part means no money which means no change in our shitty lives. - As for acting natural... - You'll get your chance. - You said everyone gets a chance. - It's Denis. There's an audition tomorrow. It's a short film but you have to start somewhere. - See? - Like I said, you have to believe. If you try, you'll succeed. It's inevitable. That's what I was saying. - Are you still going to the Elysée? - Of course. I'm going to change my repertory. I think my song might be crap. No, it's not. I want to be judged on my voice, not my song. - I'm prepared. No one can touch me. - I can! Yes, but stop What's the point These deep feelings I've got to go. I'll see you home. - You can't. - I can't let you walk home alone. I'd rather you didn't come. Another time, perhaps. - Can I walk you up there? - OK. - See you at the Elysée Montmartre. - Yes. - Bye. - Bye. - Hello. - Hello. If you need actors, extras even... I'll leave you my photos. - Sorry. We don't need anyone. - You never know. People might pull out or fall ill. Hi. You OK? This is Bertrand. He's a doctor. Very useful if you get hit hard. - This is the boy I mentioned. - There you are, you bastard! You didn't stand us up this time! I came to tell you I don't have a ticket for the match. I couldn't afford one. Did you hear that, guys? He doesn't have a ticket. Cheer up. You don't need a ticket. It's not part of the culture. We're banned from the stadium. And why should those fat-cat managers get our cash? The match used to be important but now we don't give a damn. We barely even remember the score. What counts is the fight. - Paris is playing Holland. - They're top of the league. We've made contact and arranged to meet. If we beat them we'll be back in the top ten. We were in the top ten in 2001 after a match against the Turks. It's on the Chelsea website. Such a proud moment. I hope they managed to cross the border OK. This will be a baptism of fire for the kid. Roger, get a round in. It's on me. - What will it be? - A lemonade. - A lemonade, Roger. - Lemonade! The rules are simple. We designate a combat zone. It happens of its own accord. The first to leave the zone loses. The more you beat a guy up, the more respect you get. Never leave a guy alone in the zone. He'll be massacred. - Fists and feet only. - You don't have a knife on you? You get some idiots showing up with blades. - I don't need a blade. - And watch out for heroics. Once you've got the upper hand they start lashing out and it can get dangerous. - All right? Not too scared? - Don't worry. Fear is natural. You just have to overcome it. Don't deny it, use it. That's the fun part. You see those two streets? If the cops show up, we scarper in opposite directions. Look at those nancy boys! Bastards! Come on! - Cretins! Bastards! - Arseholes! Someone's injured! He pulled a knife! Shit, he's injured. Go and get the car. You see to the kid's eyebrow. A bandage should suffice. Sit down. Raise your hand. Evening, ladies. What can I do for you? He'll be fine. He needs to rest for a fortnight. I'll sign him off work. Don't bother. He's on the dole. Would you mind putting your cigarettes out? It's for my daughters' sake. I see he's helped himself to my kids' lemonade. Welcome to the culture. What is this culture? The culture... is the only way left to us to defend our values. With France 75% taken over by Islam, those values have been hit hard. To think we escaped the commies only to end up being taken over by the bloody Arabs. The culture is me, you, Bertrand, Kévin. That's all we've got. The rest... The rest don't count. - Where are you from? - Picardy. It's nice there. And not yet invaded by toads. - Toads? - Yes, toads. "What? What is it? What's wrong?" Blacks, Arabs, foreigners. It's true, there aren't many. - Lucky you. - Let's not beat about the bush. I've seen you fight. You're a plucky kid. How would you like to help us restore a bit of order? - It's fun. You'll see. - Come to the game against the Yids. - It's not to be missed. - Who? The Yids. The Jews. You knucklehead! All right! I've learnt to fight And to find my voice Sticks and stones Might break my bones... Thank you! Next candidate, Samia Benotman. Thanks. Hello. I'm going to sing a song by Axelle Red. "A Quoi ça sert?" I often ask myself What's the point of all this effort The point of wanting to know everything Of turning my life around I strive for perfection And I can't go on Or stop What's the point Of these deep feelings Oh no I feel so confused My world has been turned upside-down I must stop questioning everything No, what's the point Of these deep feelings Oh no What's the point I've lost my way What's the point I'll walk you home this time. No, no. I said no. As far as your station, at least. If you like, but no further. It will be dark and on my estate that means trouble. I've had my fair share of trouble for one day. You're not dark-skinned enough. Still no mobile phone? I'll call you. See you. - What name shall I give? - Kévin. No. It's going OK. Someone's asking for you. I've got to go, Mum. Yes. Yes, I'll phone again, I promise. - See you later. - See you. All right? Hi. It's a present. My friend trusts me. - Is it his first? - Yes. What is it he wants? I've no idea. It's... Too common. You see that on all the neo-Nazis. He needs something original which still shows who we are. He should like this one. Oh, yes. That's cool. That's not bad. Look at this. What do you reckon? - I've no idea. - You should get one. It's part of the culture. Look. Lift my jacket up. Oh, yes. Well? What do you think? I don't know. Does it hurt? For sure. Eh? Getting a tattoo like that hurts like hell. - That's great. - What's it for? What's it for? It's art, my friend. Just art. This one's great. Look. This is cool. Yes, that's not bad. Can I bring a girlfriend to Eric's birthday party? Yes, of course. You bastard! Have you scored? Let's drink to that. Say we meet by chance in ten years? - Why by chance? - Er, we'll have lost touch by then. Don't add "er". Just read your lines. OK. Shall we start again? We'll have lost touch by then. I don't see why. Some childhood friendships last. I'm just saying, we might not have seen one another for a while and we might meet by chance, taking our kids to the park. That's unlikely if we're working at the factory. Who said anything about working there? Cut. That wasn't bad. - What's your name? - Samia. Thank you, Samia. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Bye. - Bye. - That was good. Aren't I entitled to a Saturday off? I've told you 20 times. Saturday is the one day I need help. You get the rest of the week off. God knows what you do with it. I could cover a weekday instead. The guys all work on Saturdays. Talking of work, you need to smarten up your act. You're not making much progress and what's worse, you're not even trying. When I came here I had no one to help me. Nothing was handed to me on a plate. This is all down to hard work. You need to start knuckling down. If you work hard, I'll employ you and you'll have a real salary. Plenty of people would like to be in your shoes. What about Saturday? - Have you got him a present? - I'll take care of it. If there's a present, I want to contribute. - We're going to give him a tattoo. - A tattoo? Over his whole body. Your friends are crazy. I'm exactly the woman I hoped to be My heart has come alive For you I feel This gigantic love I've waged my war Made my mark I have fought In your name I have shouted My arrival from the rooftops My reason for living I've wanted you For so many years Let the time come For me to be yours My revolution Is in your name My revolution Has only one way Of making the world go round Of changing it I'll never stop marching for you My revolution is in your name To lead the life I've dreamed of with you by my side I've changed things, turned them upside down And created the perfect world for myself My revolution Is in your name My revolution Has only one way Of making the world go round Of changing it I'll never stop marching for you My revolution is... In your name My revolution Is in your name My revolution Has only one way... Shoulders! Has only one way Of making the world go round Of changing it For you I'll never stop... Do you want to come back to mine for a coffee? That's kind of you but I can't. I have to go home. I don't get it. You're not a minor. It's not that simple. It will be hard enough to go to your friend's do. You wouldn't understand. - It's family stuff. - Am I too stupid? It's not about being stupid, although sometimes I wonder. I don't mean you. It's a question of culture. I'm sick of all this nonsense about culture. - Why do you say that? - No reason. My culture is to not let girls walk home on their own. I'm taking you home. If anyone objects, they can tell me to my face. Don't be an idiot. You'll spoil everything. Come off it. Please! Sorry. Samia? I'm not going anywhere. What's this? Who are you? Who do you think you are? - You don't belong here. - Leave him alone! - Get lost! - Who are you talking to? Your brother's going to notice he's not one of us. Get lost. Are you happy now? You should go. Please. Did you hear? Get lost! - Didn't you hear her? - Get lost, you son of a bitch! What's this racket? What will people think? - It's OK. - Go back home. We were just getting to know the kid. Aren't the city, the clubs, and the countryside enough for you? Do you have to come and taunt us here too? Get lost. Drop it. Come on. We'll see you home. Get lost. - Nancy boy! - Clear off. Come back here and you're dead. - Bastard! - Nancy boy! You're not welcome here. Hey, kid, let's celebrate your first month. Fernand, some red wine. The good stuff to go with the cheese. It's on me. More plates of food. Your parties cost me a fortune. Get out the violins. The boss is on the verge of ruin and it's all our fault. You smiled. I'm relieved. I didn't think you knew how. It's because you're always shouting at me. My poor darling. So sensitive! - Leave him alone. - I'm only joking! You're too touchy. Have you seen how hard we work? Do you think we've got time for social niceties? The dishes would go cold, and that's out of the question. The "Diplomat" restaurant, specialising in cold dishes. It would be a poor show to send him to burn in hell just because the dishes have gone cold. What the hell is going on in there? Where are you going? You're dressed like a whore. - Get out of my way. - I'm staying right here. - Let me past. - How will you reconcile with Allah, now that you're a whore? - Move. - The whites aren't on our side. - You look like a whore. - Move out of my fucking way! What's going on? Leave your sister alone. I don't believe this. When is this going to stop? You're 16. You can't even grow a beard. You're barely out of nappies! You don't lay down the law here. Our sister can do what she likes. - Sweetheart... - You keep out of this! Shut up! She's not a whore! Hey, Samia, have you got a spliff on you? Get lost! Easy! This had better be fun. I had a nightmare getting away. Me too. Luckily the boss was in a good mood. Wait. Don't look. I want to play you something. - Do you know it? - No. At home there's one house. - Yes? - Surrounded by fields of chicory. - And three inhabitants. - Two cows. - Any goats? - No. - Shit! - This is it. - Hi. - Hi. This is Samia. And this is Eric. - Good evening. - Come in. Thanks. - Happy birthday. - You're full of surprises, you. - Hi, champ. - Hi. This is Samia. Fabrice, José, Albert. Good evening. - I'm glad he's on our side! - Too right. There are too many Alsatians in France. - Out with the German shepherds! - Good evening. - Patricia, Eric's wife. - Good evening. I'm Samia. If you don't eat pork, I've made some salads. - I eat pork, and I drink. - Really? - I'll get you a drink then. Kir? - A kir would be lovely. Thanks. Hi. How's it going? Shall I take your coat? Thanks. Your friends are all ancient. Some of them are young. Is this a party or what? Make some noise. Put some music on, Eric. Your guests don't want to spend all evening talking. There's more to life than sport and politics. Here, get me another, please. Surprise. All right? This is Samia. And this is Kévin. Good evening. Isn't your girlfriend dancing? Those shoes set her arse off nicely. Have you kissed that bum yet? Are you going to dance? Dance to that? Here. - Let's go, Greg. - Already? - Greg? - It's his stage name. - Why did you say that? - Why not? They don't need to know that. So you want me to keep quiet now? It's my life and I choose what I tell people about it. Do you know what? I've got a train to catch. Bye. - What are you doing? - What does it look like? What's wrong with you? What's wrong? If speaking is forbidden, I'm off. I've got enough rules at home. Leaving already? I've got to get up early. I'll see you home. Bye. Thanks. - Are you going? - She's got an early start. We need you on Thursday, remember. OK. What are you doing with those people? - What's wrong with them? - They're old and racist. - Nonsense. - Did you see them when I danced? The women were making monkey noises. You didn't even notice. - It was just a bit of fun. - The wife asked if I ate pork! As if all Arabs were Muslims. Why not ask if I had a bomb on me? Aren't you Muslim, then? Aren't Arabs Muslim? Well, you're French so you must be Catholic. - It's not the same. - You're such an idiot. - Samia? - Leave me alone. Hello? Hello, Sophie? I can't go home. I'll explain later. Terrible. I'll tell you later. Can I come and sleep at yours? Thank you. Hey, there's work to be done. Hi. Minimal strategy: we go in there and cause maximum damage. By the time the riot police are called in, we'll have done some serious harm. Let's go. The fascists! - What are you doing? - What do we want with these people? They're handing France over to those foreigners. That's politics. I'm not getting involved. Stop it. You're just tired. Go and get some rest. - Be there on Saturday for the game. - I can't. I work on Saturdays. Are you with us or against us? It's that simple. But remember, we know where to find you. Let's go. Move! Do something! - Can I talk to you? - Hi. - I've been offered my first part. - In a film? A short film, but who cares. Isn't it great? Come and celebrate with us. Come on! Thank you. Hello! Thank you. Hi. - How are you? - Well, well! - Your first part! - Yes. - I've flown the nest. - That's wonderful. It's a long and winding path. Here. My character's name is Yasmine. Champagne! Who wants some champagne? - What do you want? - Champagne. Champagne? Thank you. Sorry. There are peanuts if anyone wants some. Here. Yes! What about you? I'm doing odd jobs. Still going to auditions? Yes? Did you want to be a singer? - Why not? - Is that how you met her? Was she a good lay? Bastard! Forget about her and remember what Eric said. Don't sit on the fence. Keep it within the family. Want another one? And don't think you can just run off like that. Not only do you have nowhere else to go, you'll make mortal enemies. That's all very well but I need to eat. - What I need is a job. - You're a pain in the arse. Eric found you work. He'll find you more. I'm talking about a real job. You stick with us, comrade. You stick with us. Excuse me. Excuse me! It's overcooked. Look at it. It was too rare a minute ago. I don't believe this! Hang on. - Well? - What the hell is he doing now? Watch. - It's overcooked. - That's the fifth time now! I'm not the chef here! - Shut up. - Don't tell me to shut up! What are you going to do now? Beat me up? I'm sick of this! He's always yelling at me. Calm down, both of you! Calm down. - Calm down, son. - He can't even cook a bit of veal. - Nice one! - I said calm down. You give in to customers too easily. You need to trick them. Learn to be an illusionist. - You're always fighting everyone. - I know. But it was that idiot with his veal. Go on, back to work. Number five is yours. You idiot! He's walked out. Come on. - What's wrong? - I'm pissed off. Bastard Yids. - They all hide behind the pigs. - What do we do now? Stay here. Some of them are stupid enough to take the metro. Idiot Jews! Look over there. It's them. It's the Jews! Police! Stop! Stop or I'll shoot. I'll shoot. Shit! Come on. Don't move. Don't move. The bullet went through you. Move it! Breathe. Deeper. Breathe in. And blow. I've never seen you like this. Breathe in again. A hooligan has died tonight at the match between Paris and Tel Aviv. An inquiry has been launched but the public state prosecutor has indicated that the 20-year-old fan, Patrick Lemaçon, was shot by a policeman while he was beating up an Israeli fan. Another man was badly hurt and 20 others sustained minor injuries. Education... Ready? Siren Song SUBTITLES: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
