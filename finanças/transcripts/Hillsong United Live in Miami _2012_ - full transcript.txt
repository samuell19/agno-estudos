my heart and search my soul We can hear you and that's a good thing because tonight it's more about your voice than it is ours. I don't know how it is you came to be here, but we're grateful, we're glad that you made it. Maybe you knew exactly what you were coming to, maybe somebody dragged you along and you're trying to work out what's happening, but I want to say tonight that you're in the right place. No matter what's going on in your world, no matter whether things are great, or if you're honest, life is really tough at the moment, maybe you're here tonight and thinking, what is happening? It's alright, I believe that tonight your life can change forever. Because tonight, these songs that we're singing are not just random songs, to some 'idea', some religious idea of a god. We're not singing tonight to a dead god or a distant god or a dormant god, but tonight these songs are songs of life, songs of truth to the everlasting, the ever faithful, the ever present God. He's here tonight and that's what this is all about; without Him we've got nothing! But tonight because He is here, anything is possible. So from the front to the back, the left and the right, wherever you're at, let our hearts be open to what God wants to do in this place. We're singing to Jesus; the Name above all names. Do you believe it? Then lift up a shout of praise! Everyone needs compassion Love that's never failing Let mercy fall on me Everyone needs forgiveness The kindness of a Saviour The hope of nations Saviour He can move the mountains My God is mighty to save He is mighty to save Forever Author of salvation He rose and conquered the grave Jesus conquered the grave So take me as You find me All my fears and failures Fill my life again I give my life to follow Everything I believe in Now I surrender Saviour He can move the mountains My God is mighty to save He is mighty to save Forever Author of salvation He rose and conquered the grave Jesus

shine with Your glory We'll shine with Your glory We'll shine with Your glory It's all for Your glory We'll shine with Your glory It's all for Your glory We'll shine with Your glory It's all for Your glory I've learn't never to get in the way of a Jesus chant... Not the Miami kind at least anyway. It's so good to be here tonight, and it wouldn't be the same without you. The truth is we get the incredible honour and privilege to do this night in, night out, and I tell you the truth, God is doing amazing things all around the world, all around this nation. It's certainly no different here in Miami, Florida. Last night we were in Tampa, it was incredible - much like this. But you know what? Sometimes we can get so caught up in what happened yesterday and maybe so focused on what's going to happen that we can miss the very moment that we're in. My prayer tonight is that we wouldn't let this moment just pass us by. I believe that God wants to do something in this place, in your life. You might be here tonight and looking at everyone else and thinking this is for them; you don't feel like this is for you, for whatever reason you don't feel good enough, you don't feel like this could be real for you. 1 want you to know that you're in the right place. Nobody in this room is good enough, none of us are good enough, that's why we need Jesus. Maybe you're here tonight and you've been doing the Christian thing for a long time; you've heard it all, you've seen it all, you've been close with God, you know what it is to sing with passion, but tonight you feel like God is far off, you feel distant. 1 believe tonight that God is going to meet you right where you're at. God - He never moves, He never changes. He says, "If you draw near to Me, I'll draw near to you," and tonight my prayer is that each and every single one of us would connect with the living God. The reason that we can have this moment, that we can come and sing with such freedom and passion, we can dance around like fools or whatever... The reason we can have this moment is all because of a moment that took place 2000 odd years ago. When the God who holds the universe, the God who holds every single one of us, knowing us, seeing us, knowing that we would fail Him time and time again, knowing that we wouldn't measure up in and of ourselves, gave what was dearest to Him - His Son Jesus. He stepped down into this world, this broken world... The Bible says He lived a perfect life and died as a perfect sacrifice, to perfect some very imperfect people. He goes on and says, in that moment, He did everything that needed to be done for everyone, and that is good news, because that includes me and you. We no longer have to live the fallout of our own lives, the aftermath of our mistakes, our brokenness, what's happened to us, what we've done, but rather we get to live in the light of a different kind of aftermath; the aftermath of what He achieved on the cross. No matter who you are, no matter where you've come from, no matter what's happened to you, no matter what you've done, He did enough on that cross for you. So this night is for you. In Jesus' Name. This song is kind of what it's all about, it's called Aftermath. The skies lay low where You are On the earth You rest Your feet Yet the hands that cradle the stars Are the hands that bled for me In a moment of glorious surrender You were broken for all the world to see Lifted out of the ashes I am found in the aftermath Freedom found in Your scars In Your grace my life redeemed For You chose to take the sinner's crown As You placed Your crown on me In that moment of glorious surrender Was the moment You broke the chains in me Lifted out of the ashes I am found in the aftermath And in that moment You opened up the heavens To the broken the beggar and the thief Lifted out of the wreckage I find hope in the aftermath And I know that You're with me Yes I know that You're with me here And I know Your love will light the way And I know that You're with me Yes I know that You're with me here And I know Your love will light the way Now all I have I count it all as loss But to know You and to carry the cross Knowing I'm found In the light of the aftermath And I know that You're with me Yes I know that You're with me here And I know Your love will light the way And I know that You're with me Yes I know that You're with me here And I know Your love will light the way Your freedom is here Your freedom is here Your freedom is here Your freedom is here The future comes alive You speak Your word and I I'm running into Your hope Because I've seen Your light You bring my world to life I'm coming after Your love I'm not shaken I'm not letting go And everything comes alive in my life As we lift You higher Let Your freedom arise in our lives As we lift You up Sing it out Sing it out Your freedom is here So take the limits off no matter what the cost I'm running after Your call And I will run this race see You face to face So let Your power overflow I'm not shaken I'm not letting go And everything comes alive in my life As we lift You higher Let Your freedom arise in our lives As we lift You up Sing it out Sing it out Your freedom is here Your freedom is here I will not fear I will not hide Your love Your love All of my life I cannot deny Your love Your love And everything comes alive in my life As we lift You higher Let Your freedom arise in our lives As we lift You up Sing it out And everything comes alive in my life As we lift You higher Let Your freedom arise in our lives As we lift You up Sing it out Sing it out Your freedom is here Your freedom is here Your freedom is here The enemy has been defeated And death couldn't hold You down We're gonna lift our voice in victory We're gonna make Your praises loud The enemy has been defeated And death couldn't hold You down We're gonna lift our voice in victory We're gonna make Your praises loud Shout unto God with a voice of triumph Shout unto God with a voice of praise Shout unto God with a voice of triumph We lift Your Name up We lift Your Name up Shout unto God with a voice of triumph Shout unto God with a voice of praise Shout unto God with a voice of triumph We lift Your Name up We lift Your Name up Beautiful God Laying Your majesty aside You reached out in love to show me life Lifted from darkness into light King for a slave Trading Your righteousness for shame Despite all my pride and foolish ways Caught in Your infinite embrace And I find myself here on my knees again Caught up in grace like an avalanche Nothing compares to this love love love burning in my heart Saviour and Friend Breathing Your life into my heart Your word is the lamp unto my path Forever I'm humbled by Your love And I find myself here on my knees again Caught up in grace like an avalanche Nothing compares to this love love love burning in my heart Take my life take all that I am With all that I am I will love You Take my heart take all that I have Jesus how I adore You Take

There's none beside You God You're there in the dark of the night While holding the sun and its light Through the triumph and trials alike there's no-one beside You Your voice called the stars by their name 'Cause You whispered them all to their place To testify to Your wonder and praise both now and forever There's none beside You God There's none beside You God I live my life to shine Your light For there's none beside You God No eye has seen no ear has heard The depths of Your love Lord No mind can fathom the love You deserve How great You are No eye has seen no ear has heard The

If you have a song to sing, if you've experienced even a glimpse of His love, of His grace, of His mercy, His faithfulness, if you've got a song to sing, why don't you lift your voice and begin to sing it out. You can lift up a shout of praise, a song of thanksgiving, a cry from the depths of your heart. Come on, begin to cry out - for your city, for your school.

Lead us in the ways of Your love We are Yours forever Our lives won't be the same Yours forever Our eyes won't turn away Yours forever Our lives won't be the same Yours forever Our eyes won't turn away I'm sure glad we came to Miami. The fact is we leave this place and we go back to our everyday lives and it's easy sometimes in a room like this, to be swept up in the passion and the atmosphere and then it's a whole 'other thing to leave this place and face the realities of life. For every single person here, the truth is that we've all got lives that we live and as I was saying earlier, for some people it's amazing right now, but for a whole lot of other people, I'm sure in a room this big, there's a lot of people who are facing some real challenges and that's alright. Jesus said in John 16:33 "In this life, you will have trouble...", but He goes on and He says, "...but take heart for I have overcome the world." Our prayer on nights like this is that... (hang on, my guitar's broken}, my prayer on nights like this, the whole reason we do it is hoping that each and every single person here would leave with the greatest sense of the revelation, the truth that we don't go alone, that God is with us, that when Jesus took the cross and He rose again, He overcame the grave and His Spirit is with us. His Spirit is with you no matter what you're facing, no matter how great the challenge, no matter how big the mountain that is in front of you. The fact is you're not alone, God is with you. He's with you in your high school, He's with you in your college, your university, your workplace, He's with you in the darkest night, He's with you on the mountaintop, in your family...He is with you. So no matter how great the fear, the pain, the burden, no matter how deep the shame, His love has overcome. It's not just something we're singing about, it's the truth and I want you to hear that tonight. For some people right here, right now you're like, 'this is amazing', but if you're honest about what you're facing tomorrow, it scares you. But you don't need to be afraid, He is with you and He has overcome. So we're going to sing this song, one last song. This song is maybe a strange place to end, but it seems like the right thing. It's called Take Heart. If you know it, sing it with me. If not, 1 pray that it blesses you. In Jesus Name. There is a light It burns brighter than the sun He steals the night And casts no shadow There is hope Should oceans rise and mountains fall He never fails So take heart Let His love lead us through the night Hold on to hope and take courage again In death by love The fallen world was overcome He wears the scars of our freedom In His Name all our fears are swept away He never fails So take heart Let His love lead us through the night Hold on to hope and take courage again All our troubles and all our tears God our hope He has overcome All our failure and all our fear God our love He has overcome All our heartache and all our pain God our healer He has overcome All our burdens and all our shame God our freedom He has overcome All our troubles and all our tears God our hope He has overcome All our failures and all our fear God our love He has overcome God our justice God our grace God our freedom He has overcome God our refuge God our strength God is with us He has overcome He has overcome He has overcome Father we thank You for the gift of Jesus. God we thank You that because of Him, because of the cross, because He died and rose again we can overcome; we have overcome. The fight we're in has already been won. Tonight God, this night Lord, I pray for every single person in this room Lord, together we lift up every single person that we represent in our lifetimes. God give us the strength and the courage to be the people You've called us to be, to be the church that You have called us to be. To be light in dark places God, that we might truly love others the same way that You've loved us. God we thank You for all that You've done in this place, and we pray God for everything. God, that this night and all that comes from it would be all to the glory of Your Name Jesus. And all the people said...Amen. God bless you people. Thank you so much for being here. We love you, we believe in you We'll see you again soon, take care.
