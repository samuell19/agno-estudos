Yes. Our dog is mad at us. He hasn’t come with me. If Solomon brother meet him, He will come happily. Here, keep it there. Have you been waiting for a long time? Did he know that he would be remanded? I had told him that there is little chance to get bail. How can he get bail? That place was rented to run theatre, He should run a theatre there. If he lets people gamble money playing cards It’s not like that dear, You come with me. Let’s go inside the office and talk. Padma, what do you know about it? Everyday they play cards and do gambling for 4-5 lakh rupees. Who are these guys? Where do they come from? Which money are they using? Does he know anything? If the affidavit for Sreejith Divakaran is ready, Take a print of it. Yes Madam, I will take. It’s not like that dear, Come! He leased that theatre for 2 years. But he couldn’t run it for even 6 months. He did all these as he had no other way. He has been doing it for the last one year. There was no complaint about it till now. Now Sadasivan boss wants him to be out from there. He is planning to start some business there, So, you don’t have any problem with him for doing gambling there. He has been remanded for 14 days. We can submit bail application within 2 days. As he is in Sub-jail, it’s not a big problem. Nobody can cause him any trouble. I am on the way to see the doctor. See you then, What did the doctor say? He can give only medicines. We need to find peace on our own. Ramya! We need to move the bail application for Stalin. Get the memo ready for that. Ok Madam, Sir, Stalin John! You are the guy who used to run that theatre, aren’t you? Yes sir. Why are you here? Movies are not successful these days. Are you old enough to be remanded? You can give a try, Maybe this place will improve. It’s your place, right? I heard that you’re the one who doesn’t show any improvement. That could be true. Everyone else is good. Or Sadasivan boss won’t have to send police to hit me. He could do that directly. I’m an unruly guy, Not just outside, inside too. Take him. Bro! In the allegation of receiving bribe of 500 crores from an American company named VMS, the verdict against Padmanabhan Nair will be delivered today. Brother! Who died? When there was no response, I thought I need a box. It should be long-lasting. Is there any box with lock? It’s for burying a person, Not to lock someone, right? What’s the size of the person? Is he big? Is it made of teak? He can sleep inside for 2-3 years without any trouble. (praying) You won’t say it, will you? - Hello, - Yes Sir, Sir, it’s confirmed, Will arrest him now. Where is sir now? He is at home. Will you arrest him from his house? Solomon, why do you speak like you don’t know anything? After taking the bribe of 500 crores, Didn’t he live happily for 7-8 years during the trial? Now he has to go to jail. Or the public will handle us. I’m only worried if he will faint when we go to arrest him. For that also, he needs to have an attitude. Ok then, will call you later. Ok. Praised be Jesus. Now and always. I have never seen you here before. - My father’s graveyard is here. - Where? It’s been around 15 years since he died. Here. Father, I would like to buy a new tomb, if it’s available. We usually give one to a family. Did you meet your father? Yes, You may leave. Solomon brother, did you see this? Brother! Can't you bring a Car? What was going on! Hugging, inviting home for lunch, Proposing for marriage, Will have to find another job. What job can we find? Not me, for you. I can earn enough riding this truck and delivering cooking gas. Last one week, I was dreaming Policemen whenever I slept. Did you take that gun from the theatre? I took it home when the police came there. What’s there to say this much? Nothing? Dear Annie, I want to buy a four-wheeler. Why didn’t you tell me about it? If I tell you, you will deny it. Do one thing, They are waiting outside, Ask them to leave, Then you will be relieved. How much it will cost? It will cost a bit. A bit means? A bit means I can’t lie to you. It will cost around 60 lakh rupees. If I ask you something, Will you tell me the truth? Of course. Where’s our dog? I killed it. How long it had been with us? Dear, dogs are supposed to be more sensible than humans. But that dog was not sensible at all. Won’t we kill if it were a human? Won’t we feel like killing? Your son is in jail and you are cooking delicious food here! I thought you would come to visit me. But no one came And they didn’t give me the phone too. It might be an insult to the old police officer to visit her son in jail. Mummy! Even if the parents grow older, their children are always young for them. You will understand it later, That you should have built your life and not police cases. You’re right. The things that I did when I was 18, I felt they were all wrong when I became 25. What I did when I was 25, Now I feel they are wrong. As you said, I might feel after many years that what I did is not right. But now, I feel that I need to do this. I felt like doing this now. Please note it down. Hello Mujeeb When were you released? Not released, I broke out. Don’t sit there all the time, Try to jump and run. Stalin! You got released! Where are you going? Comrade Sadasivan has locked it. Don’t try to mess. You don’t know how powerful he is. Mujeeb, this is a small place. So, everyone knows each other. Not because someone is greater than others. Dude Stalin, I just warned you as we worked for the same party before. Whatever we do here, No one will dare to stop us. Mujeeb, Don’t challenge a whole place. There might be someone. Didn’t see you for a long time. Achaya, what’s up? Did you lose? I’m losing, What to do Stalin? We need to recover everything that we lost. Yes, we should. Those are Manaf’s friends. Tell him that I will kick him away, If he sends this kind of people. I am yet to recover from the harm done by him. Some of Kerala Congress candidates are winning. That’s how they are. Also, Krishnan Nair and team of Nair lobby. Heard that he got a sack of black money accidentally. Also, our old District judge and three thieves. Looks like the Judge will fail. Bro, it’s been a long time since we paid the electricity bill. We will pay it later The case charged is gambling by playing cards And man-handling the policeman who came to arrest him. Is Sadasivan here? You mean Comrade? No, Mulleppalli Sadasivan. Yes. Comrade, The lease is for 2 years, 6 more months are left. Don’t ask me to leave. I don’t have any other place to go. Stalin, this is party office. Not a place to express your sentiments. It was like that before, comrade. Only when you started preaching this nasty communism, I became a party supporter. Supporter! You can pretend to be a communist And also turn down communists for your own benefits. Right? You should not pretend to be a communist, You should live as a communist. So, what I am telling you is Don’t send anyone to teach me communism. You will have to count stars! I don’t need to explain you who this Stalin is. Red salute, Mujeeb, where are you? Brother, no use of opening it again without getting a proper deal. Why do you need aproper deal for gambling by playing cards? Then, you open it, Then the police will come. And you will be arrested again. Need to call Mr. Rajan Mulankad. Will make that guy call SP. SP will call the local station. That’s the only way to work it out for the time being. If the special squad comes… We will see it then. I’ve been calling him since you got arrested. Would the party members have erased him? What’s up dude? This will take some time It was with great effort that I learned to roll it from Youtube. Else you do one thing, You pay the money to UFO. If you had managed it properly, I would have run it showing adult videos. Oh, my phone is full of those videos. I am tired of watching those. What happened? Did it get tangled again? Brother! - Come fast. - What happened? What happened? The KSEB guy has removed the fuse. What? I had told you many times to pay the bill. She’s bringing it, You call Mr. Rajan Mulankad. Give that fuse back. You pay the bill, then the fuse will come back. I’m telling you to put the fuse back. Talk respectfully, Give it to me. Brother, she’s asking me to talk respectfully. Did you call Rajan Mulankad? Yes, his phone is switched off. He might have been drunk. Call him today itself and get this lady transferred. Is that the urgent thing now? Else, will you stand here with a candle at night? PW Brest house! No, Guest house!* Oh, rest house. Suresh brother, Is Rajan Mulankad here? Nobody’s here. Naughty guy! You are sitting here reading Fire. Do you know where is? He has gone to Delhi to meet the High command. Will be back after 2 days. Anything urgent? If it’s urgent, can you show? Yes, I will show. Not this. Can you show him? Just the size of a peanut. And he is reading fire! Do you have cigarette? Sorry, I don’t have. I had one with me. What’s this? Oh, it was there. You can’t smoke here. What? It’s a sacred place to read Fire. Come, let’s go. I haven’t believed your Delhi story. Where is this guy gone switching off the mobile? That’s what I’m also thinking. If we could meet him, He would have done everything. He is definitely somewhere around here (lady’s voice heard) Where are you going? Move away! Leave me! I will call the Chief minister. Keep quiet, I will dump you in the forest. Rajettan! Open, Open Stalin, please don’t create any issues. Go away! Didn’t I tell you that it is rest house? Please leave, It’s the order of the high command, To stop shooting. Everything is for the public. Fine sir. Ok sir. Nothing, no problem. As SP had called, I don’t want to say anything. But tomorrow if any superior asks me, I will get him. Then nobody should interfere. Sir, if anyone calls, you just inform about it. He will get everything ready. Then I will take all these things and go with him. Fine? (whispering) You wait, Get up! Sir, you may also leave. Come on! Stalin, It will end up in a big game. Have you got enough confidence for that? Sir, the show will begin at 10 pm. It will continue till 2 am. The same place from where you arrested me. One who can say things openly like this, Don’t underestimate his confidence. Don’t you have the bill? I don’t have. The system is not working, So, I need the bill. An officer working here has taken the fuse away, They will know about it. There are so many cases where fuse was removed. How would I know which is yours? Dear, you know that closed theatre? It’s for that. If you had paid the money on time, Would there be any trouble? See how much money you have paid as fine. Even after paying all this money, they say that the board is in loss. They are joking. Look at that bungalow, they are very rich. Comrade, it’s a shame. With the help of that stupid Rajan Mulankad, He opened that theatre again. Let him open it. Only if it’s open, we can close it. All this is happening while our party is ruling. He is dealing with the police easily using that guy from other party. Dear, did you add cashew nuts? Yes sir. Mujeeb, police are not messing with us as our party is in rule. These policemen like the other party members more. What day is today? Wednesday? Wednesday, Tomorrow is Thursday. Day after is Friday. On Friday, we will get Stalin John out of that place. You just need to say a word, we will take care of the rest. No one from our party should touch him. I should not hear that anyone from our group caused him any trouble. On Friday, we will get him out. Saturday and Sunday are holidays for court. I will play the first show in the theatre on Sunday. Will see the rest in the court on Monday. Do you think we can throw him out easily like a cat? He is a proud man. How can he live here after getting hit by the local people? Else he has to surprise us. We need to bring a guy who doesn’t have any address. Stalin John will count the stars. Dude, what’s the matter? Can’t you call me back when you see my missed call? I was talking to Setu. What’s your program? I need to go to Kerala. I have got a work to hit someone. I have to hit a guy and come back. Nobody should know about it. Have you received the cash? I got the advance amount. Already we are involved in a case there, Would we get trapped if we go? Let’s do one thing, let’s have a drink. I don’t have any money. You said that you got the advance amount. That was only a little bit. Two drinks are enough. I won’t drink. You need not drink. Only I will drink. These guys keep thinking about drinking all the time. Nothing else. (vomiting) Sit there, Your phone is ringing. Hello, Are you Suhas? Where are you now? Suhas, it’s for you. It’s for you. Hello, Are you Suhas? He is in a meeting. When will the meeting be over? I can’t say that. Where’s the meeting? It’s in a police club. God, is he arrested? Who are you? Me… Is it about hitting the guy in theatre? - Yes, are you business partners? - Yes. That’s nice. Can’t you come? I need to get the job done tomorrow itself. I already agreed it. What about the money? Didn’t Suhas tell you? You will get the money as soon as you finish your work. You do one thing, call someone else. Need to get it done tomorrow itself. I shall tell you openly, I will send you my account number. We shall talk in detail once I receive the money. What’s your problem? I’m asking you. I have nothing to say. I’m asking you the reason for that. I don’t need to tell you the reason. What’s the matter that you can’t tell me? Did your father betray your mother? "Even though there is no distance between us" "Do you still feel the distance" "When we part in two ways" "When we part, it is as if the shore of death has come" "When we are together, it is late to understand" "To know love, is it necessary" "For having such a distance between us" "Though no one caresses me" "There is your memory near me for sprinkling coolness" "Even if we feel offended often, and weave a veil" "There is no secret between us" "You have become my eyes clearer than my own" "You made me your eyes also" "As the root for life and wings to fly high" "Are there any other boundaries?" Hello, Where are you? I’m at home. You need to come here urgently. What’s the matter? Have you given any cheque to anyone? Cheque? I have given a cheque to the Babychettan’s finance company. That cheque has bounced. The liability is 25 lakhs. They are waiting here. You come here quickly. Hey Nair, I don’t need 500 crores, Just 2 crores, At least 1 crore, Isn’t it, Mummy? I will be back soon, Because they came to me, I could inform you about it. Else you would only know when you receive lawyer’s notice. I gave that cheque to the Finance company as a bail for Manaf. It’s a matter of only 5 lakh rupees. That idiot didn’t pay it back. How would I know that he will cheat these people with that? They had taken a loan from the bank against their property. Soon it will get attached. These finance people helped them to pay the loan. And for the rest of the money, they gave this cheque. Can’t they check it properly before receiving it? That old man went to collect the cheque, The girl was not with him. You do one thing, I will call that girl, we will ask for some time. - That won’t work. - Why? Even if we try hard to show that we are great people, There are some situations, That tell the world that We are nothing in this world. She has seen me in such a situation. My name is Stalin John. I gave that cheque to help a friend. I didn’t know it can cause such a big problem. You can move legally if you want. But Padmavati is my lawyer. You will have to find another lawyer to run the case. I know that you don’t have anything with you. And I won’t get anything if I sent you to jail. I shall sign a promissory note for you, Or I will give you my phone number. I will accept whenever you call, Even if I don’t, you can know where I am. It’s the first time in my life that someone else owes us money. So, you can understand the situation in my house. Betty, come! Don’t run! Stop there. I told you not to run. Betty, Did you like it? Yes, I did. Whom do you like more, me or the dog? The dog. He came only today. You keep him with you for some time. Then only you start liking him. Only after that let him inside your house. - Do you understand? - Yes. Go and play. How about you? What? Don’t take it to the forest. I will be back now Why are you here, in the uniform? Nothing. These days many arrests are happening. What are you talking? Just be careful, That’s it. Sir, Didn’t you see the news? But Sir is very strong. Whom to fear when he has 500 crores with him. Still, why didn’t the party leaders help him when such a big amount is involved. After the arrest, no one said a word to support him. That’s because, No one got a penny out of that 500 crores. He didn’t involve anyone in that deal. Solomon, what’s your role in this? They won’t be left alive, he who tells and he who listens. Why did you buy such a big bottle? To make me drunk? After paying the electricity bill and grocery bill, There wasn’t enough money to buy your single malt. Here you are. Hey Pappu, Have you ever got insulted? Did you feel sad about it? You are sad because you get insulted once in a while. I don’t feel sad as it happens to me every day. Get lost scoundrel. Where are you going? To buy some food. Do you have money? I don’t have, will borrow some. Don’t borrow from anyone. God, hope there will be some balance left. - Sir, - Yes, Am I late? I can only wait, Used to wait for Padamanabhan Sir before, Now waiting for you. I had visited Padmanabhan sir in jail. As I’m his accountant, I have showed him all the accounts till now. What is left is your accounts. Padmanabhan Sir is 74 years old now. He is becoming very adamant these days. That I can understand. Sometimes he talks like I’m stealing all his belongings. He is like that. When all the accounts were checked, There was a mismatch of 2.5 crores. You should talk to him about that. Solomon, what’s your plan? Padmanabhan is sleepless these days. He keeps on asking about the money to be given to his daughter in Australia and son in Dubai. What shall I do? Tell him that we will give everything. But not now. If we take it out now, no one will get anything. Let this mess settle down. And let me finish some urgent things. We will settle everything. He handed over 500 crores to me and is relaxing in the jail. Solomon, if you can’t, you may leave. It’s not because we don’t have anyone else to keep the money. Sir, please don’t get tensed. Padmanabhan sir is on our side. It’s because you keep on drinking scotch. I shall send some local toddy with Mani, Have two drinks, Then you will understand what I’m talking. God, Solomon, my drinking experience is more than your age. (news reading in Radio) Former Industries Minister and the Cultural Leader Padmanabhan Nair Was arrested yesterday with the order from the court. He had been accused of corruption for a very long time for receiving 500 crores as bribe. This led to political turmoil and ended up in his arrest yesterday from his house. Sir, Someone is here to meet you. A man or woman? It’s a man. Can I have a nail cutter? What’s the current situation? The news has been published on newspapers. Not that, Have you received the money? It is safe. Don’t keep anything with you for the time being. Do as I say. You be safe. Don’t get into any trouble. I will be at home. You may leave. Potty said that 2.5 crores are in your account. I told Potty that, If Solomon has taken it, there will be a valid reason. Sir, I took it when there was an emergency. I forgot to tell you. Potty is an old-fashioned man. One crore is with me. I will replace the amount that I had spent in 2 weeks’ time. Whatever you have spent, I know it’s for us. Don’t worry about that. Keep that one crore with you. Do you understand? I shall hand it over to Potty. You can keep it. Solomon, money is dangerous. In future, we both should not have to fight with each other. An amount of 500 crores, is a lot of money. Both of us may not want to give it up. Is everyone fine at home? Fine sir. - Hey, - Yes, Do you have spare cooking gas cylinder? Ours is about to finish soon. I shall bring it. Bro, the guy who did it is an outsider. Mujeeb was boasting about it sitting in the shop. If we could find out where he was from, we could have taken revenge. Let me bring the gas cylinder. I had saved few to sell in black market. Mom, I am leaving. See you then. What you said can’t be done. They have clear account of all the stuffs. - How much money do you need? - Money is not the problem. This will cause problems, then you will be caught. And after that we will also be caught. Do you understand? This is not a simple job. All of us will go to jail. Shall I leave? Wait dude. I shall give two small pieces. Don’t get me into any trouble. You do one thing, Come home for Diwali. We will crack it in the front yard. - Trying to mess with us, - What? I was telling that to him. Seems they don’t know that time has passed. Wait and see. I will find the betrayers this time. As if you will. Hey, If you tell this to anyone, you know me, don’t you? I don’t do like that. Stalin, you want cutting or shaving? I came to read the newspaper. What happened? , , My plan is not to go fishing in Sadasivan’s swimming pool. Bro, we are not good enough for that. We will be in trouble. This is a small place. Stanley, it’s non-bailable. Not just me, nobody can win it. I’m sure about it. Don’t do that. You will go to jail. I’m advising you as your lawyer. One more thing, In our country, There is a limit to do things for everyone. That’s same for Vijay Mallya and also for Stalin John. How many cases have been charged against you? Stalin, this is the limit. If you do anything more, you won’t exist. Sister, This is my habit since school days, I don’t care how great one is or what he has, If he hits me 100 times, I will hit back at least once. If I am not good enough for that, This Stalin John will work as a ticket seller in Sadasivan boss’s theatre. Sadasivan has got some goons out, Only at night, As the relevant case is a blast case And as the court is considering the arguments of the accused, The court is considering the argument that The cylinders used for explosion were used for cooking purpose. Hence, the court sentences the accused for 4 years imprisonment and A fine of Rs.50,000. Comrade, Hey, don’t think that everything is over with this. You will never see your family again. Go to jail, I will show you what I can do. Comrade, I exploded the theatre using gas cylinder. I had put some crude bombs also. I didn’t hear it exploding. Be careful when you go there to clean. If it explodes, you won’t have hands left to call the slogans. Sir, they are making plans to trace the money. I heard. Have you got cigarette? Lighter please. They took away the lighter. They are checking using the details from bank and other stuffs like notes. Padmanabhan Nair received the bribe in dollars. American dollars. From which bank can they get the serial number. A third person can’t touch that money unless one of us surrenders. If you surrender, Solomon, it’s American dollar, It doesn’t have Gandhi’s head, I will forget that I’m Gandhi’s follower. Are you new here? Yes Sir - What’s the charge? - A small blast case. You’re not a terrorist, are you? Go to G block, they will show you the way. Do you want a beating or will you sing a song? I will sing, sir. Then sing. (singing a tamil movie song) Enough, stop. Walk Mani! At what age did your father die? May be around 70 years. Padmanabhan is also around 75 years old. Solomon brother, he won’t die any time soon. Why? He has got a wife, family and grandchildren. So much of wealth also, Rich people don’t die fast. If he doesn’t have any money, will Padmanabhan die soon? Even then, he won’t die. What can make him die? All human beings in this world die due to one reason. Suppose we get trapped in a place, And when we realise that there’s no way to get out of there, We will die there. The scientific name of that death is frustration. How much did you drink? Four pegs What a foul smell! How much did you drink? Mani had drunk too much. How about you? We had it together. So, it might be four. - Annie - Yes, Which is better, to kill a person or to lie to him? I don’t understand. Which would be better, to kill you or to lie to you? If you are drunk, just keep quiet. (A Visual from a film) What happened Solomon, why are you so upset? Sir, there is a problem. Maybe it’s just a doubt. Say it I heard that there’s an undercover operation being carried out. I got the information from CI Shahul Hameed. Who is that? He has come with me to see you. I remember. It would be better if you talked to your party leaders. They haven’t said anything till now. Now, only they can help us. If it was before I was arrested, I would have thought about it. Now, I don’t need to. Solomon, how long would I have to sleep on this bare floor? At least for 2-3 years, sir. Only by then, we can get that money converted. I have moved the money to a safe place. To get it, one will have to kill me. It’s ok to stay in jail after stealing 500 crores. I decided to do this knowing the consequences. It’s time for lunch. If I don’t eat on time, it’s hard to digest. 20, 21, 22… Isn’t it enough? Move away man! Let him do what he wants. (screaming) Did you understand now, who I am? I just hit you for money, I don’t have anything against you. Move! Come on! Come on! What are you guys watching? Stop them! No, Sir I have given him enough. Leave him Come on! Go there! 130/90 Sir, there isn’t any big problem. There is a slight variation. If it repeats, we will have to check. What’s up Potty? Had met Solomon. - Did you tell him about the money? - Yes What happened? Didn’t he say anything? He did. But he doesn’t look very confident. Why? I don’t know He is still young. Maybe he things he is smart. Let’s wait and see. Sir, I just told you my doubt. He is not saying anything clearly. Maybe it’s my problem. Then, it’s better for him. It’s been a long time since I know him. I’ll be back soon. Okay I had duty in the kitchen What’s your name? Majeed Abdul Rahman I have written it. Yours is a blast case, isn’t it? Anything else? Stalin, are you still angry with me? I am not angry with you. Also, I have nothing to talk to you. Can you please listen to me? While I was in Mangalapuram, There was an incident in Mampram And they put me in jail saying I’ve done the conspiracy. It was a murder case. I haven’t done that. But I have done many other crimes. They didn’t punish me for that. Shouldn’t we try to get out of here? Us? It’s possible only if we are together, - To break out of jail? - No, Through proper channel He will help us only if you are involved You’re the only guy I know here. Majeed, forget the relation we had for past years And I am telling you not to call me for such things. What are you guys whispering? Any plan to break out of jail? Yes sir, We have started digging from the other end. He wants to meet you. Will you go there and meet him? I’m in jail and how can I go to meet him? He is also here. We will do it only if you agree. Come inside Please sit I have been thinking about reading this book for a long time. I got time only now. Sir This is the special food for VIPs I shall come to the matter. You have to do certain things for me. I am not sure whether you can do it or not. But when I read your case diary, Blasting the theatre in daylight And walking through the town without fear, I find some heroism in that. If you can help me to move things forward, I will take care of your case. I always keep my promises. Have it. After few years, I will come back here with a better case. Then I shall have this VIP biryani Ok sir, I shall leave Stalin, you tell me Do you have cigarette? Why are you wearing dhoti? Just like that, It’s been a while since we met. How’s your health? I think I won’t die soon My name is not there on the newspapers these days Apart from you, everyone has forgotten about this case, Me too I can’t stay here anymore I’m 75 years old now Not sure when will this pacemaker made in America stop working The two guys I had mentioned, will come to you. Save that 1 crore for them Just to correct an old mistake Sir, I came to tell you about converting the dollar Don’t do anything I know you’ve already done so many things for me Solomon, go home and learn wearing single dhoti That’s what they wear in the jail Solomon, I’m not your dad to forgive you anymore If you build a wall around me and fix an iron gate, Did you expect me to stay inside it? I don’t see any variations in ECG Will it work for some more time? Why not? It’s an American Pacemaker It will definitely work Okay, I shall move then, have to visit patients Sister, Get the results Sir Sit down Yes Sir Do you know when one needs to have pacemakers? When the mind dies At that time, if one is fixed, then there will be no feeling guilt You can do anything You must do me a favour Get my two boys out from there One’s term is almost over How can I, sir? Something like Sentence reduction… Good conduct… such procedures are there right? When you release other prisoners release them also along with them And they will go without creating any issues If I get involved in this case It may not work with the present political scenario They will not let it work If it is you, people will think it’s according to the formalities Who are the guys, Sir? They are not someone who has star values But they hold an item Would you mind helping me? If you had thought the same about my case, then I would’ve been sacked from job long ago So, they will be out, won’t they? I lost the job Now I do food delivery and running this taxi Who is the guy with you? I don’t think I have seen him among decent ones Maybe it’s because of hitting people in the dark Do you know each other very well? We resolved all the issues with a fight Hope Sadasivan, Mujeeb and Che guevra are fine Comrade has opened his own bank now Fantastic Rs.60 for Biryani…Biryani This is Vinod , my new staff If there is any food left out, distribute it in the Govt. hospital Let’s have biriyani today Okay then What a surprise! The guy from Dubai ! Did you come empty handed from Dubai? What I got from Dubai is not good enough to give you, mom Who is this guy? He’s the one who arranged my visa for Dubai Oh…Come inside.. Come It’s good that I got married in life A kind of enthusiasm Children, Grand children.. Don’t want to die Please don’t feel offended if I ask something Despite having children, why did you entrust Solomon? It’s the not the salary that the Government had paid, It’s the commission I demanded If I give it to my children, by the time I return from here They would have fought amongst themselves and died If I give it, they will have a feeling that their dad has given it to them And that Solomon, I really underestimated him There is no time left now How will it benefit us? If you don’t cheat me like Solomon did, Then your life will be spared Just joking I always keep my promises The blows that we get after the age of 60 Will weaken you Because we know that we don’t have enough strength or time, to strike back Padmanabhan Sir, we are just 30 Even if we receive blows, we have adequate strength and time to strike back I will cook a story about you to Solomon But he will definitely not believe that story when you go to meet him, keep that in mind Don’t accept the cash that he offers you That’s a test dose He will try his utmost to avoid giving that I believe you guys blindly Because I know how many kilometers your bike has run And Stalin, I even know how much money your mother receives as widow pension Don’t forget to meet Potti I got something to tell you I am leaving for Mangalore tomorrow morning Why? I am not sure of your present situation But it will be good for you to join me Padmanabhan Nair, 500 Crores, Solomon, Potti By the time we finish this drink I think it will be better for us to forget all these We are like suicide-bombers But I wish to live That’s why I approached Padmanabhan and got out of jail before the punishment period And it is not for helping him Then why the hell did you drag me into this? I could have called anyone But none of them are in jail because of me I don’t want to move from here Hope you heard about Solomon Majeed, If you go from here, will that resolve all your problems? He even knows how many kilometers your bike had run And how much pension my mom receives! And you talk about hiding in Mangalore? Isn’t it better to acquire something rather hiding and dying? - Did Padmanabhan Sir send you? - Yes Was it difficult to find the location? Doesn’t matter We located through Google map Where are you coming from? A little bit far place Far means? From the Beach road The money is with my friend Got to collect it from him - You came by car, didn’t you? - Yes Maniya! You follow us in the car I will get ready and be back Have we met earlier? No chance Where were you? In Kochi , for a long time What were you doing? I was driving Uber I also had a driver - We are going to his brother’s place - Hmm An old friend of mine Cash is with him Being a friend, he made me run a lot for the Cash And yesterday I contacted him and said that Padmanabhan Sir needs the cash If I don’t give you the cash, Padmanabhan sir will get upset I can’t offend Padmanabhan Sir Won’t we get the cash today? That’s what I have been telling you His brother was with me for long time He deceived me and looted plenty of my money and flew to Dubai Unfortunately, the third day, after reaching Dubai, in a Mysterious Car accident in Dubai He died Yeah, I will reach there in an hour Keep the cash ready You are at office, don’t you? Yes I will be there, I will reach the office soon Okay dude.. If Solomon asks for me, say that you don’t know Didn’t I tell you that I will be reaching here in an hour’s time? Hope you are returning home with cash No Solomon I… Here is Padmanabhan Sir’s cash Take it “The times have changed, we will fight together” “build an empire with embers in our hearts” “shall make our own dream world rushing like wind” “We shall demolish any hell if we stand together” “What has sprouted in fire will not wither in sunlight” “We’ll carry weapons and be ready to win” “This game of dice is difficult” “The game of chess continues” “The dreams weaved together “ “Will not be shattered by anything” “Let’s climb the steps now without faltering feet” “with only aim in our mind, with truth and righteousness” “Let’s climb the steps now without faltering feet” “with only aim in our mind, with truth and righteousness” When did you reach? It’s been few days You bought a new car? Do they pay salary in Jail? They gave it for good conduct I had met Babychayan’s son the other day I escalated our cheque case to him He said his dad will never do that Immediately he resolved the matter Okay "The times have changed, we will fight together" “build an empire with embers in our hearts” “This game of dice is difficult” “The game of chess continues” “The dreams weaved together” “Will not be shattered by anything” I won’t remember this Everything needs to be accounted, right? Give this account to Padmanabhan Sir I don’t deal all this We were told that you are his Accountant That’s why I brought it to you Not only Padmanabhan’s Sir Cash dealings I deal with all his accounts Just a minute one more please Suhas, any news?

That’s all Run when you ought to! Otherwise we will be in a fix Solomon must have collected all the details about us It’s good to keep some distance with him Do one thing Call Potti Sir Let’s meet Sir tomorrow morning Please wait outside for 10 minutes Solomon had enquired about us in our hometown He must have known everything Don’t meet him anymore What if we do? Solomon had met me this morning Never spoke a word of you Hope you understood why I said Can you arrange a financer? Don’t bring petty people Hope you remember how much cash we hold!! I will talk the rest to Solomon And if they ask about the terms of repayment? Ask for a week’s time I know how to retrieve cash from Solomon in a week’s time Hello, where were you? It’s been a long time Who is this? I am with him since 2 years, he is my friend Stalin I see! I am Arjun Seth Well, what is the matter? A profitable deal Need to convert few dollars Accounted or unaccounted? Accounted ones only, but can’t be shown If its small dealing, I have people here Not small dealing I know a man Only if you are certain about the cash we can get it done I am sure about the cash.. Everything is okay Show us the man I will direct you the way Just visit over there If you could connect us directly, we shall go and meet him I don’t think there is a need for that And people don’t visit there unnecessarily What is his name? Mohammed Sanafar Where do you want to deliver the money? I mean anywhere in India? Not entirely A small amount in Dubai and in Australia My client’s two children are living there And give the rest to me In Dubai, I will deliver it immediately And Australia I think it won’t be an issue, My person is there How much is the total figure? 70 Million US Dollars 500 Crores Rupees approximately Carrot is very good for your eyes So, it’s a dollar transaction It is a 2-3 years process as it is a big amount! There is a problem A client wants to convert some dollars If he doesn't need it immediately, We shall proceed it tomorrow itself Hello Solomon Hello Sanafar You never responded anything about the conversion of dollars Is the rate set? Two parties have come with similar amount If you don’t require it immediately Shall I give a hand to them? well,in that case, it will take 6 months to do the transaction Can you do me a favour? Can you show me the people? Can you please show them? Well what do you say? You fix the rate But only one condition They both shouldn’t leave the place alive That’s how I run my business Who are you? Who? Oh no! For such nasty acts, this is what we usually do Break into the house and flog Go inside Solomon, 500 Crores that you are holding Is parentless cash Just because of that, don't assume you are the only parent Didn’t you break into his house and assault him? He has lodged an attempt- to-murder case against you For trying to kill him, his wife and children Was there any need for you to resort such a way? Shouldn’t I atleast retaliate to that extent? You could’ve atleast told me A Policeman, whom I know, informed me about this Otherwise they would’ve arrested you It is your fortune that Home Minister has called for a Police Conference now All Policemen are there They will be coming here after the meeting Better leave the place by dawn They are Policemen They will not spare you! Solomon would have met the concerned persons and done whatever has to be done What should I do now? Do what everyone does Go in hiding Anywhere outside Kerala I am very hungry, Majeed Me too have the same feeling Isn't there any fast food shop? Am asking you if there are only houses here? No fast food available here? Will your dad run fast food at wee hours in Mangalapuram? - Then why the heck.. - Talk softly, dude Then why the heck you made me walk all the way here! You needn’t do anything, I will go and steal food from some house What? You will be flogged, mind you I will get it Would you eat? I won’t eat stolen foods You wait here, Let me see if any suitable house there to steal Hold this May be you are used to beatings! I'm not interested. You! To refrain her from screaming, I did so You need anything else? Can I get scrambled eggs? Scrambled eggs! What is that? We add grated coconut in it, and the rest are same as Omlette Oh I am sorry, there is no coconut at home Doesn't matter Is Omlette enough? No need My dad used to make Why did you come all of a sudden in search of me? Normally you don’t return so fast when you go away What is the case now? He assaulted a man in his own house! That’s why for a hiding.. Is that why you came running here? Is everything okay? What? If everything was okay, then I would’ve got settled in Dubai Police are there too Chitra, aren’t you at home?

Things are getting too complicated, Majeed Police washed their hands off They say that they are not aware of anything, what to do? What a hell is this life! Mom died and Police also detained you You loved your mom a lot, didn’t you? I asked her a lot about you But she didn’t speak a word about you It happened by mistake, You forget it There is nothing to worry, Stalin When you had taken it at the behest of Padmanabhan Nair You should have brooded over We are not innocent boys! Hello Write in Padmanabhan Nair’s account That Solomon has killed one more guy he had sent Hello…hello.. Dude! Did you watch the new video of Sachin? A new one, advising those not wearing helmets It was very touching People do such things for becoming famous! Who? Sachin? Why not? Talking too bad! What bad did I speak? Why don’t we stop caching frogs, and do something better hunting like pigs or wild buffalo? Basically, we are hunters Hunting small frogs are much difficult than hunting big pigs? Get me? Yeah, come Have you seen a gun, bro? Asking me if I have seen? Once me and my brother-in-law went to Sholayar Forest for hunting My sister was Nirvayar(Full term pregnant) NiraPara! I meant Full term pregnant I took my brother-in-law’s gun I suddenly saw something moving in the forest I brandished a Gun like this And shot a bullet It worked I shot at the bums of a forest guard! I am a kind of a man who hunted a person Really? I swear You know with what difficulty I solved that issue Bro… a man over there .. Look Hold him Shucks! Bed has gone dirty Why are you cleaning this dirty man over here? You could have cleaned him outside Bringing everything in! Oh God! My slippers have also gone dirty What is wrong with him? Don’t know Who brought him over here? Two strangers brought him here and left What a trouble!! Must have fallen down somewhere in inebriation! Solomon, hadn’t I thrashed and offered him to you? What should I do now? You don’t do anything now, help him if possible What did you say? He got paralysed below his waist He is half paralysed And in a very bad shape! He can never get up and walk Dying was safer!! Padmanabhan’s Cash… That was rather better If Potti learns this, he will call me Just that Padmanabhan Sir is not fighting with me He knows my moves well Solomon, Your time is bad… So please stay quiet Police knows how to put him behind bars I will get that done Please make him understand that there is no point in living like this Sir, he can recall everything, can’t he?

What is the case? Sir, trespassing IPC 404 and 323 While taking him to the Station after the arrest He jumped out of the jeep Did he jump or was thrown out? Stop creating evidences on Remand! Rather remanding him, take him to the hospital Open..Open He might die without water Sir, I know this case personally Police arrested him in front of me Few days later, we found him half paralysed in Government hospital I have brought the bail application If there is any possibility, please don’t send him to Jail Even otherwise I was waiting to send them away Don’t ever step in here for any case! You wait - Did you hear what he said! - Get lost Where the heck has he gone! He might have heard about my condition, Let’s wait Shall we ask him about the cash? Hope he recalls us All of you wait outside for 10 minutes Here he comes I regret to see you in this condition Doesn’t matter, Sir Hereafter don’t get involved in anything, Just forget our deal And don’t meet Solomon Even though you forget about the money This Stalin is not ready to forget even any small loss happened in my life Things are not as you imagined Depends on people with us! We want money to go further My condition has become like this Don’t you see? I don’t have any money Stalin Let’s move, Majeed Stalin, I will arrange, don’t go Solomon is alive only because of my incompetency You also see to it that you don’t die confined in the cell Otherwise after Solomon’s death, there won’t be any heir left for that cash! Don’t give them a single pie They are of a kind who clutch on it if they get a little hold!! Does Padmanabhan still have cordial relationship with them? No, he washed his hands off And I am well aware, you don’t have any sincerity towards anyone That’s why I called you confidently I am not with any mongrels in this World! Tell me Potti Sir Stalin, Solomon called me today and ordered not to give you any cash Be careful He lays a trap for you! You had deposited money in some finance company, didn’t you? Better withdraw it as early as possible Now look at your condition after playing Underworld!! Take my losses also into account while settling You might have spent some days in jail But when theatre razed into fire I incurred more losses than you I will deduct that amount Hey come Do you wish to count? Well, my account is settled now Solomon, go home and learn wearing single dhoti That's what they wear in jail Didn’t you leave? What happened? Car is also there Are you sending me away? As if you will immediately leave! Won’t my dad ask about you if go home? You never used to send me home Tell him that you broke up with me Couldn’t you send us to Dubai if it’s for the matter of 3 days? My only sister lives there It’s not for three days, just one day maximum You will leave today and return tomorrow There is nobody to manage here I have some personal dealings I can’t entrust that to anyone That’s why You look disappointed! I know only the Solomon at home I still not know about your dealings Go and meet superintendent He is a bit scared Have you brought the phone? Hand it over to Superintendent Solomon? I will deal with him You may leave Keep those boys with you I should have killed that Stalin You can’t catch them that easily Looks easy to grasp But can’t get a hold of them!! Bring some ice please Hi Solomon!! Are you enjoying the drink? Oh Cognac I will also take a gulp then Bring ice Sir - Cheers - Cheers sir. How did you come, Sir? By car Had to come, Solomon I’m the one in need Only that they won’t let me out permanently To let me out for a single night, there are courageous Superintendents in Kerala even now what brings me here is.. You must give me that cash I came here to collect it Sir, I don’t have it over here Don’t you still have it with you? Yes Sir Shall we move then? It’s quite far off, Sir Inside old St. Paul’s church Cemetery Even if you say it’s in Karachi, I am ready to come Annie and son have gone home, haven’t they? I met them on the way I told them not to travel alone during night hours And sent my person also with them What do you say? Let’s move, Sir Mani, you lead us I will follow you with him Sir, I will change and come Are these your father’s earnings to scoop away alone? Padmanabhan Sir and Solomon will be reaching here any moment Better leave both of you, that will be good for you We came here at the behest of Padmanabhan Tell Solomon What happened? Who came here? Speak up They ran away with the cash Who? Didn’t you send those two guys? It’s them only..They took the cash During some particular moments in life, I folded and tucked in my dhoti like this When I was denied a Seat at the age of 33 I walked inside the party office tucking in my dhoti When I was accused of taking bribe By the Media, Politicians and others, I walked like this only Ultimately, when Police entered my home with Court order saying all the evidences were against me I walked with my dhoti tucked in only I didn’t faint Nor was I hospitalized with any chest pain I was sleeping on the bare floor, Solomon…bare Later, I had walked like this through the Verandah of the Central Jail Finally, I am standing in front of you like this, What am I to do now? Instead of praising the smartness of a Paralysed man Go and get the money Hello, Where are you? At home Is our son asleep? He has slept What happened? You, old mongrel! It’s a game of crores! I may even pull the trigger against Gods!! Presume it like that People mostly use knife as a Weapon in our country But to win this game We need a gun What is it, Solomon? - Do you have a cigarette? - Yes Here Those guys fled away with 500 Crores Padmanabhan had come to meet me I killed him What are you talking? He is inside the car I was forced to kill him Please help me Only few more years left for my retirement Please don’t drag me into such things Then you arrest me! All the evidences are inside I am confessing standing right in front of your station It’s not here that you should confess When he was lying paralysed in the Government Hospital You should’ve thought about it Then arrest me if you can Solomon, I spoke out of fear This case will not solve None of us can escape Technically, Padmanabhan Nair is still in jail If Nair is not found there, Superintendent will hold the responsibility Two brats have fled away with my 500 crores What am I supposed to do now? I want to retrieve that Money The longer we delay, the greater the risk is! For that you got to sell this body to him Catch them wherever they are And put the murder blame on them It’s unaccounted money If any senior officer finds it, everything will go down the drains A game of 500 Crores! If needed, I would even buy the law of this State Henceforth it’s your turn to call And I will come Sir is not picking up May be their discussion is still not over Had he directed us where to take this money, Do you have any tension, dude? Solomon… like an unleashed dog He must be looking for us What brings you come in these wee hours? I am on duty Someone killed Padmanabhan Sir I am just returning from the spot Where are Stalin and Majeed? Why? I suspect them Where is Solomon? I don’t know Please come Sir is accusing you for killing Padmanabhan Sir Speak to him Potti Sir, is it true? What the hell did you think of yourself? I came to take you away Hello…this is my space No Police tricks here Oh, I see You stay here till the case is solved How long can you hold a Police officer on duty here? Until we are safe Solomon has killed Padmanabhan Don’t you guys wish to live? Shouldn’t there be a reason for Solomon’s ending? For us to lead a peaceful life, You must do a favour Then there won’t be any issues between us And everything will be as you say What do you want? You should kill Solomon Pardon Kill Solomon Even if you threaten to kill me I won’t do that I won’t threaten, I will be forced to kill Please think about it By the time I kill you and Solomon It would be dawn Rather it would be better if you kill Solomon and return home by dawn It’s Solomon…Convey him as I told you Soloman, Prathapan has arrested those guys And is taking them to the Station by Jeep Before they reach the Station, We need to know where the money is. Sir, everything is set as directed - Ok Sir. - Ok. He called to tell me about Solomon Is he dead? Hmm Can we trust him? Unless and until we see Solomon’s body, we will not believe it Then you go and check, I will wait here By the time we return, you must not be seen here And don’t make us visit your home, Mind you Get me You can decide how to prepare the FIR of Padmanabhan’s Sir Murder case And don’t forget it was you who called Solomon and killed him Have come to kill Solomon? I am still living only for that When this Stalin john became half paralysed You thought that I lost my manliness too! That was your mistake. Moreover I assaulted you at your house, isn’t it? Even otherwise I never expected you guys over here Hereafter nothing will be as you imagined, Solomon I must kill you Until I don’t kill you, I know I can't touch him I don’t believe there is any greater inspiration than one’s Ego in this World When you enquired about me in my town You asked who I am But you didn’t ask who I was. Padmanabhan’s Sir’s car was caught while checking CCTV Visuals at bypass We are checking the rest of the Cameras, Over Has the body moved from the spot? Yes Sir - I will prepare Padmanabhan’s FIR - Okay sir Out of 500 Crores, I have some amount left with me. That is my business, Man But I need to ask someone If it’s Solomon, then you needn’t We finished him It’s not to Solomon but someone else Mr.Mohammed Sanafar, this is how I run my business!
