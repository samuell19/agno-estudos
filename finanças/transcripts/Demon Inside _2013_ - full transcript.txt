The 22 Major Arcana come from the symbols of the universe. And their interpretation depends on their position. That's what we're going to discuss. -Marta? -Imagine that... ...it's a quest... Marta? When I saw him... ...I didn't sense anything evil. Did you feel attracted to him? Did you like him? I don't know... Maybe a little. Maybe my vision was clouded and I didn't see it coming. I don't know why I insisted on doing a Tarot reading for him. He said he didn't believe that someone could foresee the future. He didn't believe in your gift, how did that make you feel? That's normal. It's normal being afraid of knowing... ...what can happen to you around the corner. What did his cards tell you? The strongest card was The Lovers card. I thought they were talking about us. Because I felt a... ...strong connection between us. Hi! You didn't have to wait for me here. No! Don't! Don't scream! Help! Are you sure she's ready to leave? Honestly, I think it's now or never. Though relapsing is a risk, facing reality will be good for her. Everyday life. If she stays... ...she will remain hidden within her shell. That would make the agoraphobia worse. Are you sure you don't want to go to your apartment? No. I'm sure he knows where I live. He's in prison. The string must be tense so it works. Otherwise, you won't hear my voice. Mom? The voices won't leave me alone. What do they tell you? They ask me not to leave them. To help them. Don't be afraid. There are people like you with a special gift. Who can feel and hear the lost souls around us. You can help them, comfort them. I don't understand. Why can't I see him? No one can see everything, dear. No. I can do it. The apartment is really warm. Don't worry, it's all clean. It's a good thing it's furnished. How much is the rent? Don't worry about that. Thank you, Monica. The bed is big... ...but there is no TV. You know I don't watch TV. I'm sorry. I have to take this call. Did you like it? It's pretty, isn't it? I like the fact that it's well lit. Don't, leave them closed. What is this? It's everything I managed to rescue from your store. Burn everything! -What? -Burn it, I say! I can't do that. That store was your life. Not anymore. What about the Tarot readings? You have a gift! I saw how you changed people's lives! If I'm so good, why didn't I see what was going to happen to me? Why? Why? -No one can see everything. -I was so stupid! Don't touch me! THE INVENTION OF MOREL "The Mischievous." Where is it? Monica, I'm so sorry I got like that. It's OK. I just want you to feel better, and focus on yourself. Yes, me too. Everything scares me and I can't stop sensing things... ...I just don't want to anymore. -Do you want me to come? -No. I found a box full of clothes and other stuff. -Did you know the girl with the dog? -Who? -The girl who lived here before. -Before? I don't know. I'll ask my uncle. But Marta, we agreed you'd relax. Sure. Where is it? Where is it? I was playing. Where is it? Where is it? Hello. How are you? I'm fine. And you? -What's going on? -Nothing. You sure? -Nothing. -Tell me. No! -You're not gonna tell him, right? -Of course not. Neither will you, right? Is somebody home? Open the door! Open the door! I just want to talk to you. Open the door! I know you can hear me! Open the door! Open the door! I just want to talk to you. Are you hungry? I can fix something for you. No? Are you sure? I brought you my old laptop, so you have something to do. We'll need to hire an Internet service. It's okay. I found an open signal.

One here and... ...there. Why are the windows covered? What happened? I saw Mario. What? He was there, on the street, looking at me. You saw him on the street? Marta. -I swear I saw him! -I believe you. I believe you. And the woman next door is scary. Yesterday she almost knocked the door down yelling... I think I'm going crazy. Marta. -Are you taking your pills? -Yes. I'm doing needle point. What? I read... ...it helps to get relaxed. But I think it doesn't work for me. Let me. Can you do me a favor? Sure. Ask your uncle about the girl who lived here. Why? Did something happen? -I think she died in the apartment. -Why do you say that? -I think I just saw her. -What? Did you have a vision? It's a long story, but I have the feeling she died... ...in the bathtub in a horrible way. Marta, I don't know what to say. Are you sure that you saw her? Maybe you're stressed because of what happened. I'm telling you, I saw her.
