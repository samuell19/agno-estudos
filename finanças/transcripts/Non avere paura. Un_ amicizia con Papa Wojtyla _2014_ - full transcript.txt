(MultiCom Jingle) (peaceful orchestral music) (birds screeching) - [Angela] Aren't you freezing, dressed like that? - [Lino] Not at all. This way I can really feel the mountain. (quiet orchestral music) - [Angela] What's this place called? It's amazing. - Summit Cross. When I was little, I used to come up here every day. I felt like I owned the whole world. - You came up here all by yourself? Weren't your parents worried? - No, I was born here, in the refuge. I spent my whole life here, it's my home. It's down there, in that world, your world, that I have a hard time breathing. But now, what I wanna do is join an international expedition to the highest places in the world, away from everything for weeks, or even months, and seeing places that no one's ever seen before. - And your girlfriend would let you do this? - I haven't got one. - Who knows how many you brought up here? - Trouble is, not many have the lung power to make it. (laughing) The truth is that, I never brought anybody here. It's my own special spot. - So, why me? (romantic orchestral music) - [Announcer] The Pope is standing on his white vehicle at Saint Peter's Square. The crowds are there for the Pope's General Audience. Here's the moment of the attack. - What happened, Mom? (gunshots firing) (shushing) - [Announcer] The white vehicle, which was moving slowly, with the Pope standing up, now makes a fast exit from Saint Peter's Square. It is headed down to the Arch of the Bells. We know there's an ambulance waiting there. We are able to see scores of astonished people remaining at the Square, visibly shaken and upset. The expression on this woman's face tells it all, how much this tragedy has impacted so many lives. Here's the vehicle. - Who could do something like that? (lock clacking) (door banging) (somber orchestral music) (lock clacking) (somber orchestral music) (lock clacking) (hinges creaking) (somber orchestral music) - I didn't really think you'd come. - But I wanted to. (quiet orchestral music) - I want to speak to the Pope alone. - Your Holiness, this man has already tried to kill you. - What I have to say, I can only say to you. - I also have to speak with this man, alone. (quiet orchestral music) (children shouting) - Can't you take a later one, and stay a little longer? - No, it's back to work tomorrow, you know that. - Come on, skip work, take another week off. - I can't do that, they need me. Come with me, move to Milan. - Me? - Yeah. - In the city. - [Angela] You could find a job. - Aw, come on, no market for what I do there. Look, you're a lawyer. I'm a ski instructor. I climb mountains, there aren't any in Milan. - I make plenty for both of us, until you find something. - I couldn't do that, it's not my style. (bus engine revving) Bye, Angela. (bus horn tooting) - Bye, Lino. (sad orchestral music) - Excuse me. Sorry, excuse me, excuse me. A young faithful wrote to tell us about a most beautiful place, the Lobbia Alta Refuge, up next to the glacier. - My name is Lino Zani, and I live up the glacier refuge. It's my family who runs it. - That's perfect. So, can you take us? - Yes, but, why would you want to go there? - Well, a young faithful told us a friend who loves these mountains. - There it is. (bird screeching) - [Stanislao] Who else lives here? - Oh, just my family, my parents, and my brother and sister. - Has it always been with your family? - Since my grandfather's day, right after the war. Let's go. - Okay. - This is our pantry. - And you do all the cooking, is that right? - Yes, up here, everything is homemade. This is the nicest room. It's also the closest to the bathroom, down the hallway. - Perfect. - Are you gonna stay long? - What would you say, madam, if I told you that the Pope would be coming here to spend some time? - The Pope, here? - I'm Don Stanislao, his private secretary. He's heard about Adamello and has sent me ahead to scout things out, as you might say. - When, when is the Pope coming? - Any minute now. I have a request for you, Mrs. Zani. Your discretion is absolutely essential. Please, do not tell a single person, only your family, this visit must be a secret. - A secret? - And there's one more thing. The Pope won't be coming alone. He'll be coming with one of his friends who wanted so much to join him here. - A friend, who? - Come on, it's a joke. No really, does anybody seriously think that the Pope would come here? - The gentleman told me that the Pope likes to ski. - Come on, Mom, a pope who skis? - He also that a friend of the Pope is coming with him. - And who would that be, Mom, the president of the United States, come on. - Yes, the president. - Which president? - Our president, the Italian one, Sandro Pertini. (chuckling) (peaceful orchestral music) - All right, Lino, see you up at the top. (adventurous orchestral music) (gasping) (groaning) - Hold on, Bocha. (adventurous orchestral music) - Well done, guys, well done. What's your name? - Lino, Lino Zani. - And you? - I'm Francesco Gori, they call me Bocha. - Bocha and Zani, you both are real good. But if you work together. - Do you think we can do the Himalayas with you? - Once you find a sponsor, and the money, get in touch. See you guys. (wood cracking) (helicopter puttering) - Shame on you all. I used have brought some mountaineers with me, not you lot. My, what a terrible first impression we're making. - Perhaps it's your fault, for not telling them where we were going. - You're right. - [Lino] Mr. President. - Thank you. I can take care of myself. - What's your name? - Lino, Lino Zani. - Lino, today you and I are going skiing. Where do you suggest? - Oh, up on the glacier. There's more snow there in the summer, Your Holiness. - Great. - Okay, Lino, which way is it? - Oh, this way, please. - Be careful, Mr. President, it's quite steep. We'll help you. - I knew I shouldn't have brought you along. You're not a real mountaineer, are you? - For you information, Your Holiness, during the war, I trekked across Mont Blanc, entirely on my own. Come on, let's do it. - It's good? - It's nice. - Your Holiness, the snowmobile is ready. Don't you wanna go skiing? - I'm coming, thank you. Lino. - Yes, Mom, it's true. You just served cappuccino to the Pope. - That's great. - But now, you can let the tray go. (snowmobile roaring) - Compared to the wonders you have here, the Quirinale Palace is mere trifle. - [Lino] Oh, really. - What could Dad be talking to the Pope about? Usually, it takes a team of wild horses to drag a word out of him. (peaceful orchestral music) (bird screeching) (wind whistling) - What were you talkin' to him about? - Nothing. - At the end, he blessed you, so what was it? - He heard my confession. - He gave you confession, the Pope, here, in a snowmobile. - I needed to do it. - Franco, that kind of worries me. - Are you ready, Lino? - Yes, coming. (peaceful orchestral music) - Have you seen how well the Pope skis? Just like a swallow, bravo, bravo. (peaceful orchestral music) - Is somethin' wrong? - No, no. What is that? - They put it up in memory of people who died here. It's been there since the end of the war. It's just pine, and every year, we think the ice will break it or knock it over, but it's still there. I guess it's some kind of mystery. - Will you take me up there? - Oh yes, of course. (wind whistling) (peaceful orchestral music) I'd like to be here alone for awhile, please. - Yes, of course. (peaceful orchestral music) (wind whistling) - Did you notice the silence, Lino? Not even a bird. (peaceful orchestral music) - This little excursion of ours is so wonderful. We must not keep it a secret, besides, if someone finds out, then what will they think? We can't always listen to these gentlemen of security, can we? Do you realize what they've told people to keep them off the mountain? That they have to explode some bombs, leftover from the war. - Could that be true? - Well, yes, yes it was the only way to make sure no one came up here. - By terrifying them? - Otherwise, we'd find ourselves under siege. Reporters, photographers, snoopers of all sorts, and who knows, maybe even some criminals. - Criminals, up here! - You're underestimating certain people, Mr. President. - Not at all. I think that the public would be delighted to know that we're just like everyone else, and that once in awhile, we need a little getaway with friends. Really, why does this have to be secret? - I don't like secrets. - Yes, but, Your Holiness-- - Sandro is right. I think that people will be pleased to know that the Pope, too, sometimes needs to go to the mountains. - Finally. - Right. - [Lino] I have an important message. - Somebody hurt up there? - [Lino] I just need to speak with the chief. - [Chief] This is the chief, what's going on? - Hi, chief, I have an important message to deliver. - From who? - [Lino] The president. - The president of what? - President Pertini. - Right, I know your trick. - No, listen, it's not a joke, it's real. - You want me to have you taken in for harassing a public official? - I swear to you, President Pertini is right here. And the Pope, too. - And what are they doing up there, shots of grappa? - Hold this, Lino, give it to me. This is President Pertini, I'm the one doing the shots. The Holy Father, however, is having tea, due to his weak stomach. - Well, I don't understand. Zani? - What is your name? - Chief Plessidi Stefano. - Then see that you don't waste my time. Now, the message is this. - Sorry sir, I can't find a pen, get me a pen. - [Sandro] Plessidi, what's it gonna be? - Paper, somebody get me some paper! - Take down this message at once. We want to apologize for having closed off the area for security reasons, and we send our best regards to all mountaineers, signed Sandro Pertini, President of the Italian Republic, over and out. - I want to thank you, and Italy, for this precious opportunity. It's the greatest of gifts, welcoming me here, to your mountains. - You're very welcome, my dear friend. It's rare to spend time like this. Look, free, away from the world. But the truth is, that tomorrow is the 17th, and on the 17th, I never take airplanes or any other flying contraption. - Fine, in that case, I'll be sure to come back on the 17th. That way, I can ski in peace, and you can stay at home, Mr. Causing of Everyone So Much Trouble. - You, you. - You. (chuckling) (helicopter puttering) (quiet orchestral music) - [Woman Reporter] Is it true that the Pope can ski? - [Man Reporter] What about Pertini? - [Chief] As I said, I have no more information. - Hey, buddy. Hey, chief, I'm Luca Burger. The family hosting the Pope, what's their name? (bird screeching) - How long have you been coming here, Lino? - The first time was when my father carried me up on his shoulders, before I could even talk. - Do you feel lonely, living up here? - Oh no, never get bored for a second. - And what about now, now you are grown up? What do you want to do? (bird screeching) - My dream is to climb Mount Everest. The top of the world. - Why? (bird screeching) - I want to find out what's beyond it. What's there, after you reach the top? Even it maybe there's nothing, nothing you can touch anyway. - [Pope Paul] May I ask you something else? - [Lino] Sure. - Are you a believer? - I really don't know. Well, when I was a kid, I took communion and everything. But now, I just don't give it too much thought. I wonder if I could ask you a question. - [Pope Paul] Yes. - Why did you want to come here? - (chuckles) Well, to understand yourself, you first need to let go of certainty. And then, look for the answers. Up here is an excellent place to look. (majestic orchestral music) - [Lino] Ladies and gentlemen, stand back please. - [Man] Over here, sir. - What can you tell us, sir? - Stand by. - That's where he-- - Hold that pose. - [Security] Stand by, all right, back it up, sir. - [Man] Look out, get a picture. - Back up, back up. - Get back. - [Woman] It's really him. - Your Holiness. - All right, come on, people. - Back it up, back it up. - Excuse me, excuse me. - [Security] Give him some room, give the Pope some room. - I want to take a picture. - Holy Father. Forgive me for taking the liberty. This is for you. I noticed that you like it, and down in Rome, they don't have jam like this. - Thank you so much. It will help me remember you, and your kindness. - Holy Father, please, the helicopter is waiting. - I must go, and greet these people. - You just can't, Your Holiness, you know that. - They climbed. - Your Holiness. - All the way up here. - Your Holiness. I can't ignore them. (crowd murmuring) - No no, no no, I can't allow it. This time, you have to do as I say. - [Security] Right this way. - Could be too dangerous. - Your Holiness, bless my family. - See you, the helicopter. (crowd chattering) - [Security] All right, okay, he's coming through, people. - He's coming this way. - Get back. (applause) - We get to see him. - Yeah. - [Woman] I can't believe this is happening, oh my God. - Can I take a picture with you, Pope? - [Man] Oh, Your Holiness, thank you so much. - [Woman] Thank you, thank you. - Right this way, please. - Your Holiness. - [Woman] That's not fair. I'm never gonna see him in my life. - Will you be coming back? - Yes, I promise. I will, I will. - Wonderful. - [Woman] Your Holiness, please, over here, over here. Just one touch, please. - Thank you. - [Woman] Please, I'm never gonna get to-- - This way, please. - Thank you so much. - Let us through. - Oh, I kissed him! - [Security] Thank you. (applauding) (crowd shouting farewells) (applauding) - Where is Lino, I haven't said good bye. - I don't know, up there! (crowd applauding) (helicopter whirring) - Here you are, including the negatives. So, what are you doing with them? - Oh, nothin', just mementos. - Mr. Zani, I'm Luca Burger. - Do we know each other? - You don't know me, but I know you. Do you realize you're famous? - You've probably mixed me up with somebody else. I'm the editor of a weekly newspaper that sells millions of copies. - [Lino] I've already told everybody, all the other reporters, that we don't want to talk about the Pope. - I certainly respect that decision, most admirable. But I have something else to discuss. Will you join me for a drink? - No, thank you. - I've heard about your big dream. Everest. - How? - I asked around in the village. I want to help you make your dream come true. - What does that mean? - Have a seat, and let me explain. (birds chirping) - But just a quick drink. - [Luca] Yes, of course, absolutely. - He knew everything, that I needed a lot of money for my expedition, about 200-million lire, and of course, I'm a ski instructor, and I'll never have it, you know that, Mommy. - And he'd give it to you, just like that? - No, his publisher would. - What does he want in return? - This. I mean, there's nothing wrong with that. Nobody told us to keep it a secret, right? - I don't know, I don't. - You know how much they offered me? - I don't want to know it. - He said 150, but then, when I was gonna leave, he just doubled it, without batting an eye, like that. 300-million lire, Mommy. With that money, I could finance my trip. And the rest, I could give to you and Dad. Then finally, he could have his operation on his back. And you can find someone to help you around here. And stop standing all the time, on your feet. - I don't want it, it's wrong, Lino. - What's wrong with that, they're just photographs. - It is wrong, and you know it. - This is something that happens once in a lifetime, Mom. - Lino, could you help Dad in the woodshop, please? - Sure. - When you've thought about it, I'm sure you will tell him no. - I already told him yes. He's expecting me tomorrow in Milan, with a check. - I am happy with our life. And I thought you were, too. - Okay, let me help you. - No, I can do it myself. (bus engine revving) (dramatic orchestral music) (bell tolling) (somber orchestral music) - [Stanislao] Lino! Lino! - Good morning. - Your call was such a surprise. - I know, I'm so sorry. I just happened to be in Rome, and now I'm here, and I realize how crazy it was to show up like this. I'm sorry. - No, you did exactly the right thing, come in. Come in. (peaceful orchestral music) - Does he really have time for me? I mean, these people are so much more important. - Oh, he's hosting an international meeting here. For the representatives of every world religion. But he'll be happy to see you. (peaceful orchestral music) - Is this where the Pope lives? - Yes, he's waiting for you. Holy Father. - (chuckles) But do I really ski so badly? All twisted up, like that, I thought I was a champ. - No no, it's just the old style. You twist your shoulder, instead of shifting your weight from one leg to the other. - Mm, ah, this is Martino, how is he? Franco, Carla, why didn't they come, too? (suspenseful orchestral music) - The truth is that, I was supposed to go to Milan today. To a publishing company. That was gonna give me 300-million lira, for the pictures. And of course, with that money, I could mount my expedition. - But instead, you came here. - Yes, but I really didn't know until the very, very last moment. Sorry, sorry, Your Holiness. - Stanislao. (speaking in a foreign language) If you succeed in climbing your mountain, then what? - I'll go looking for another one, higher. (chuckles) - Thanks. When you reach the top of that mountain, please, place this cross there. From this moment on, you'll be our Mountain Apostle. You'll take a cross to the top of every mountain you climb. - It's so beautiful. But, Your Holiness, I don't have your faith. - I have faith in you. (upbeat piano music) - Okay, you're booked for an hour at noon. Let me offer you something else. Would you like to send your friend a postcard from the Himalayas? - From the Himalayas? - Yes, my brother's getting money together for an expedition. If you buy a postcard, you become a sponsor. - Only 1,000 lira each. But if you buy one, I promise I will send it with your message to anyone you want me to, straight from the Himalayas. - [Customer] Okay, I'll take one. - Sure. - [Customer] Thank you. - [Lino] Thank you. - [Angela] And what's dah-lo-gih-ree? - The dah-lo-gih-ree... (romantic orchestral music) Angela. - Hi, Lino, you haven't changed a bit. - Neither have you. - You still dream of going to your mountain? - It took me some time, but I've almost got the money together. - Why are you always looking for danger? - You know me, I love adventure. - So how much for the postcards? - [Lino] 1,000 lira each. - Okay, give me three. - Oh, three, great, thank you. - How could I not help a friend who loves adventure so much? (chuckles) - So, you're here on vacation? - Yes. - So, and the postcards will go to? - To my husband. - To your husband. - Mom. - Yes. - When is the teacher coming? - These are my kids, the other two postcards are for them. We need a ski instructor for the entire week. Could you recommend one? - Yes, of course. Oh well, I could do it. - Oh no, it doesn't necessarily have to be you. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I'd be happy to. Really. - Okay. - So, what's your name? - Barbara. - Barbara, and you? - Marcello. - Marcello. - [Barbara] Shall we go? - Let's go. - Great, bye. (quiet piano music) (peaceful orchestral music) - Do I look okay? - [Mr. Zani] It's not you. - Well, thank you. - Mom, you look just beautiful. - Okay, everybody ready? - Yes. - Come on, we're late. (peaceful orchestral music) - I brought you some of that jam you like. - How wonderful, thank you. - I don't know how to thank you, you and the Holy Father. - Here, this is what we owe you for the postcards, plus all the addresses to mail them to. - Wow, there's half of Poland here. - Can you imagine what they'll think when they get a postcard from the Himalayas, and from the Pope? - Stanislao. - Yes. - Could you take a group photograph, please? - [Stanislao] Of course. - So, Lino, have you got enough to climb your mountain now? - I've also got a mountain of debt, Your Holiness. - [Stanislao] Here we are. - What about everything else? Have you found what you are looking for? - Oh, I'm not sure, but I met someone. Her name is Angela. - Another one, Martino, get in closer. Everybody smile, cheese. - Maybe you get your head on straight, do you think? - [Stanislao] Okay, thank you. (rain pattering) - I have decided something. - What? - I'm going to leave my husband. - And the kids? - I don't know, I'm afraid for them. They'll suffer, and he, he doesn't deserve it. It's all my fault. - When will you tell him? - Tomorrow, no, right away, tonight. I can't stay there anymore, I can't lie anymore. So, what about it? Will you be there for me? Oh, right, your precious expedition. - I'm sorry, I must do it, I can't let my buddies down. I just can't. - So instead, you abandon me? - This is part of who I am, and you have to accept that. - I feel so alone. So terribly alone. No, that's okay, it's okay. I'll manage all by myself. - [Lino] No, Angela, wait, wait. - The kids are waiting for me, I need to go. Sorry, Lino, but really, you can't help us. (sobbing) (dramatic orchestral music) (rain pattering) (choral vocalizing) - Okay, everybody. We're stopping here. Let's make camp. (peaceful orchestral music) - Hey, you already whacked out, Zani? What about a race? - Take it easy, Lino, don't let him wind you up. From here on, the glacier starts. - What's better than a race along a glacier? - Okay, let's do it. (peaceful orchestral music) I bet your lungs are about to burst. - Save your breath, Bocha. From now on, it's all ice and crevices. - [Franco] You scared of a little ice? - [Lino] Aw, shut up. See you later. (adventurous orchestral music) 5,000 meters, can you still breathe, Zani? - To me, this is the best air in the world. - But not if you're out of breath. - Who's out of breath? - You won't make it. (choral vocalizing) (adventurous orchestral music) I caught up, Zani. (peaceful orchestral music) (bird screeching) (suspenseful orchestral music) (screaming) - Lino! Lino! (somber orchestral music) (groaning) Lino! Lino! Lino, can you stand up? Are you okay? (groaning) We're sending down the rope, can you secure it? (bells tolling) (somber orchestral music) - No. - I didn't make it to the top. - Tell me what happened. - I'm okay, I'm okay, just some fractures and a cut face. In a couple months, I'll be good as new. Oh, my buddy said that it was really a miracle, when they knew you gave me this. I don't think God would waste one on someone like me. - So, what is next? - No idea. To go there, I let somebody down, somebody who loved me. And for what, just my pride? - Who is it? - Oh, it doesn't matter now, I've lost her. - Getting to the top is hard. But there is something even harder. The hardest of all. - What's that? - Coming back. That is what counts, Lino. (peaceful orchestral music) - Where's my teacher, Mommy? Where is she, where is she, my buddy? - Okay, be good, see you after school. - Are you sad, Mommy? - No, I'm fine. - [Marcello] Bye bye. - Bye. - Bye. (bell rings) - Now, go on in. - [Teacher] Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. (suspenseful orchestral music) (Angela sobbing) - Angela. I finally understood. That it's not me that's important, or all that junk I fill my head with. What I really want is to have you in my life. Every day, you and the kids. And there's one thing I want more than anything. I want us to have a child, Angela. I want to take you with me, right now. - Take us away, right now? Who, exactly, do you think you are? You come here, all high and mighty, thinking that I want nothing more than to jump in your car, and go off with you. To who knows where. I left my husband, and live my own life now. You actually believe that I was just hanging around here, and waiting for you? I love you, Lino. - I love you so much, Angela. I promise, I will never leave you alone, I swear. (shushing) (romantic orchestral music) Good morning, Your Holiness. - What do you say, Lino, shall we do it every week? Great, shall we go, I don't want to get caught. - Holy Father, please, don't go too far. - That is exactly what skis are for. - But, Your Holiness. - Lino is with me, nothing is going to happen. - What if someone recognizes you? - They're used to seeing the Pope, not some skier. See you, at the refuge. - So much for security. - In a way, it's his greatest security. You have no idea what joy it brings him, his freedom. (peaceful orchestral music) - Hi, there. - Hi, you're the Pope, aren't you? - Yes, and you? - John. - Where are Mom and Dad? - Dad is at work, Mom's over there. She's sunbathing at the solarium. - And they let you ski by yourself? - I have three gold stars. - I bet I am not as good as you. - Do you wanna race? - Yes. (upbeat orchestral music) - [John] Look at me. - [Lino] Really good! - Jump at me. - Did you see my jump, Mommy? - Who are those men? - It's a secret. - A secret, you tell me right now who those men are. Tell me the truth. - It's the truth, that one there is the Pope, but you can't tell anybody. - [Woman] The Pope. - He likes to ski. - He looks nothing like him. - Are you blind? - Don't be rude. - No really, you're blind. - The Pope is in Saint Peter's, not on a ski slope. Sir, what have you been telling my son? - No, excuse me, madam. But your son is telling the truth. This gentleman really is the Pope. - Doesn't even look like him. - It's entirely my fault. I was sure no one would recognize me, but your son is very observant. - Oh no, it can't be. - Yes, it's me. So, it's been a pleasure meeting you, and joining you for lunch. - May I ask you something? - Yes. - Could you bless me, Your Holiness? I don't want to cause you any trouble. I'm going here, in this corner. - [Pope Paul] But of course. - Please, it's so important for me. (quiet orchestral music) - Amen. - [John] Me, too! (peaceful orchestral music) - What about you, Lino, haven't you thought of starting a family? - Well, I don't know how to put it. I'm about to become a father. - That's great news. Congratulations, you told me nothing about all of this. When can I meet your wife? - Uh well, I have to tell you something. We are not married. She's separated. I know you can't approve, and you're right. - Are there children? - Yes, two, and they live with us. - Marriage is a sacrament which cannot be broken for any reason. - I will love her with all my heart. - That isn't enough, that doesn't make it right. When will the child be born? - In three months. - And the name? - Martino, like my father. Or if it's a girl, Camilla. - What about your mountain climbing? - I promised to stay home. And not risk my life anymore. - Very good. ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫ Happy birthday, Camilla ♫ Happy birthday to you - Blow, Camilla! (applauding) Blow out the candles. - [Lino] Bravo, yay! - And now that you're seven, what would you like to do? - I want to open my presents. (laughing) - This is from Mom and Dad. Open it first, honey. - [Camilla] I like it. - [Angela] What's that? - Hi, guys. - Hi, Lino. - Amazing, what brings you here? - I was lookin' for you, they told me you were here. - Me, how come? - I'm organizing a new expedition. - Oh really, where to this time? - Everest, Lino. - Everest. - I thought of you. I want you with me this time, Lino. - I don't know. Today is my daughter's birthday. - What a nice family. With my life the way it is, no way I could have a family. So, what do you say, you comin' with us? (birds chirping) - [Lino] I wonder if I could ask you something. Could you give me a confession? I know it's weird, the last time I was 11. - Has anything happened? Tell me. - I promised to stay, I know. But I can't stand it. - Being a good father is more difficult than climbing a mountain. - I don't know if I'm a good father. What I do know, is that I wanna come back up there. How a man can let a woman put him in a prison. - I also have something to confess to you. - To confess, to me? - I have Parkinson's. - I had no idea. - You know, Lino, like you, I do love freedom. But in a few years, my body will be my prison. And escape will be impossible. - How can you accept that? - Because I am Christian, we are always free, even in prison, that is the meaning of the cross. I will remain in my place until the end. - But I'm not like you. I don't have your strength, and your faith. And you know that. - And I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for not being able to help you understand. - Why are you so worried about me? (wind whistling) - Because you are my friend. (wind whistling) You see, he came. Our other friend. The wind. Whenever you and I are together, he always shows up. He says hello to us. You have to promise me one thing. When I can't anymore, you will come up here. You will remember me. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Barbara] Mom! Look how good Camilla is. - Yeah, really good, Camilla. Lino, come and see what Camilla is drawing. - Sure, just finish here, first. Need to be ready for Sunday. - Sunday. - They've asked me to join an expedition. - What? - [Lino] This time it's Everest. - [Angela] Why didn't you tell me? - That's what I'm doing now. - Last time, you almost died. - Nothing will happen. - Aren't you happy with us? - Happy. - Yes. - [Lino] What does that mean, exactly? - It means, not wanting to go off all the time. - Listen, Angela, I'm totally happy with you, really. But I also need to go, to feel free. - You're not free with me, with us? - It's my dream, and you should understand that. Why, why don't you try? - What's up there you don't have here? - I don't know, and I need to find out. - I'll tell you what's there, nothing. Only glory, even worse, competition, with the other guys. Which almost killed you. - [Lino] That's not true. - Okay, suit yourself. - Angela, wait, wait, wait wait wait. - What more do you want from me, what? I already said you could go, so go, but don't expect me to be happy about it. - [Barbara] Mom, Dad, look! - It's nice, it's called Mommy and Daddy. Do you like it? (peaceful orchestral music) (adventurous orchestral music) - [Lino] Today we arrived at Camp 3. I've got the cross with me. I have to say, I'm a little ashamed of this responsibility you gave me. Me, an apostle, it's gotta be a mistake. The sky is so huge, filled with a light that's almost scary, so empty that you could lose your mind looking at it. Or get drunk with a sort of happiness that grabs you by the throat, here words fail. (peaceful orchestral music) We're 1500 vertical meters from the top. The temperature here is 30 below zero. (grunting) The very last camp. Tomorrow, a couple of us will try to conquer the summit. One of the two will be Paul, the leader. And the other will be whoever he chooses. The one he thinks will have the best chance of making it. Maybe tomorrow, I'll be up there, on the peak. (choral vocalizing) I've gotta make it, and then I'll see what's beyond. - Lino. (peaceful orchestral music) (adventurous orchestral music) (grunting) - Shit, the camp is gone, we can't stop here. I don't think we can make it. - Damn it! We can't give up now. - If we get caught outside the tent at night, we're dead. We could try again tomorrow. - No, the weather is changing. (wind howling) We might get stuck in camp for days. And then if it snows, our climb is finished. We can't stop now, not when we're so fucking close! - But there's no time to check out the approaches. We have to take our chances with one of them, and hope we don't get blocked. - Okay, I'll try this way. You take the other one, okay? - And what if one of us needs help? - I'll take that risk. - Okay, but we stay within shouting distance, check in every 10 minutes. And Lino, good luck. - Good luck to you, too. (wind howling) (somber orchestral music) - Paul! I'm at 120 meters, I think. - [Paul] Lino, okay, I'm at 100. (wind howling) Lino, 70. - I'm at altitude 80. 80, don't you get there before me, huh? (quiet orchestral music) (wind howling) (laughing) Paul! I'm there! 50 meters to go. Paul, do you hear me? Answer me! Paul, where are you? I'm almost there! Almost to the top! Paul, answer me! Paul, Paul! (moaning) I'm not stopping, I'm not stopping. I'm not going back. (grunting) (moaning) (wind howling) (suspenseful tones) (wind howling) Paul! Paul! Paul! (wind howling) Paul! Paul! Paul! (grunting) (gasping) - [Paul] Lino. Lino. - Paul. Paul, say something. Paul, you have to stay awake, you have to stay awake. (grunting) Come on. (somber orchestral music) Come on, Paul, come on. (grunting) (quiet orchestral music) (wind howling) - Frostbite is extensive. As soon as it's daylight, he must be taken to the hospital down below or he loses his feet. - I'll take him down. - What, but if you do that, it means no Everest. - It's time to go back. (somber orchestral music) (wind howling) (choral vocalizing) (dramatic orchestral music) - Three, two, one, up. - Lino, we'll reach the top for you. (bird screeching) (dramatic orchestral music) (wood cracking) - Nice cut, you're learning. - Lino, I can't believe it, how are you! It's so good to see you again. - I'll come talk to you in a minute, I've gotta see Angela and the kids. - Oh, Lino, Lino, wait. Just listen, Angela, I don't know what to say. Wait, Lino, wait! Lino, Lino, wait! - Angela, where is she? - She's gone. - For when? - She waited and waited for you. - Didn't she know I'd come back for her and the kids? - Why did you leave her for so long? (somber orchestral music) (birds chirping) - Me and Angela... It's over. And this time for sure. It's all my fault. - Don't be afraid. Lino. In fear, all faith is lost. - I don't have faith. I don't know what it is. - Faith. Is so simple. It's love. (quiet orchestral music) - [Woman] Showers, as you go into the next, let's see, the next 12 to 24 hours, you can see that the rain really does become much heavier, particularly for Switzerland, eastern parts of-- - [Man] We interrupt our regular programming to bring you this special news bulletin. Pope John Paul II is in grave condition and has been admitted to Gemelli Hospital in Rome. The prognosis is not known. (air horn blaring) - Watch out! (metal crunching) (somber orchestral music) - You are already awake, Mr. Zani, a good sign. Can you hear me clearly? It's a real miracle that you're still with us at all. - Another miracle wasted on me. - [Announcer] We were speaking about the foreign delegation which will be present at the Pope's funeral-- - Lino. - And we can see the dignitaries-- - Lino. - Arriving in Rome being received by Agostino Mauriello. As millions of the faithful start to go down for the Pope's funeral, Rome is also preparing to receive a wave of delegations from all over the world. - So you came. - At this time, we are reporting 153 nations are sending representatives... - When I found out, it was so terrible. Why didn't you let me know? - I'm such an idiot, Angela. Forgive me for ruining everything. - [Announcer] And take off and land at the airport. - I would have never been in love with you, Lino, if you weren't being who you are. - Do you know what I found out on Everest? That what I was looking for was right next to me. It was you. - I came to get you. Are you well enough to travel? - Yes, I am. - Okay. (announcer drowned out by romantic orchestral music) - Lino. It was He who saved you, you know, a second time. (quiet orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) (wind whistling) - See that? He told me, whenever we were in the mountains, it wasn't just the two of us, but also our friend, the wind. So, he also came to say good bye. (wind whistling) (pages rattling) (birds screeching) (wind howling) - What is it? - I was just thinking about something that somebody asked me once. A long time ago, right here. - [Camilla] And, what was it? - [Lino] She asked me why, why all my life, I always wanted to climb to the top. - [Camilla] And what did you answer? - [Lino] That I didn't know, really, I just had to. - [Camilla] And now, do you know? - Yeah, yes, I know. But it's something you cannot put into words. It's something inside. And maybe, that's what he wanted me to understand. That's what faith is. I'm sure one day you will find out, too. (quiet orchestral music) Shall we go? - All right, Dad. (peaceful orchestral music) (wind howling) (adventurous orchestral music) (MultiCom Jingle)
