Rudyard Kipling MOWGLI RAKSHA Screenplay by Leonid Belokurov Directed by Roman Davydov Man? A Man-cub? Man. I've never seen one before. He's quite naked. Give me back my prey. No, the Man-cub is ours. Don't you understand? It is I, Shere Khan, who speaks. And it is I, Raksha the demon, who answers. The Man-cub is mine, and only mine. Now go away, or I'll tear you to pieces. We'll see what the Pack says. On Council Rock. What will the jungle say? So this is a human's cub? Now, was there ever a wolf... who could boast a Man-cub amongst her children? I've heard now and again of such a thing. Shere Khan is right about one thing... The Man-cub must be shown to the Pack. Lie still, little frog. Little frog. I will call you Mowgli the Frog. Mowgli! Mowgli! Mowgli! Mowgli. Mowgli. But what will the Pack say? A Man-cub is living with the wolves. We don't care. Mowgli! A frog! A Man-cub! Bananas! Bananas! Sahi! Sahi! Sahi! Sahi! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! A Man-cub is living with the wolves. Mowgli! - A Man. - So what? What do you mean, so what? The jungle is disgraced. Stop this idle talk. Oh, magnificent Bagheera, I've been looking for you. Can you imagine? A Man-cub is living with us wolves. A Man? That's interesting. Where did he come from? He belongs to Shere Khan. What?! That murderer is hunting Man again. Sahi the porcupine passed through here. Whoever is first to pick up the trail... and find Sahi... A family of wolves have adopted a Man. Adopted a Man! I told you to find Sahi, not to grab him. You never listen to my instructions. How many times do I have to tell you? Wolves have adopted a Man! Wolves! You are a Free tribe... But one of your families took in a Man. A disgrace! The Jungle is disgraced! A Man in the pack! Throw him out! Quiet! Settle down! That's what I said. A disgrace! - How could it happen? - What will happen now? A Man among us! Enough! Settle down! We shall do as the Pack Council says. They're coming! They're coming! I think... Observe them well, wolves. I'd say they are good hunters. But there is a man among them. I am against the Man. Yes, they will make good hunters. But the Man must go back to his own pack. Who speaks for the Man? Who else speaks for the Man-cub? He is mine. Give him back to me! Who speaks for the cub? He won't be killed... He will live! This may be my last fight, but he will live! A Man. A Man-cub. Mowgli. I speak for the Man-cub. He will be useful for the pack. I myself will teach him. He's mine! Who else, besides Baloo? Give him to me! O, Akela... and the Free Tribe... The Law of the Jungle... says... Every creature for himself! That's the Law of the Jungle! That's right, every creature for himself. Quiet! Are you man-eaters? Only Shere Khan and his henchman Jackal can do that. Yes, that's right! The Law of the Jungle... says that the life of the cub... can be bought at a price. Speak, Bagheera! To my words... I will add one bull... That's in accordance with the Law. A bull that I've just killed. What do you say, oh wolves. What does it matter? Let him run with the pack. He'll burn in the sun. He'll die in the winter rains. Where's the bull, Bagheera? Over at the bend of the river. I'll only be a minute. I'll see where they went. Let Mowgli run with the pack. Train him well, Father Wolf! That's alright... I'll get you later. I'll get you later. Yes, keep roaring... for the time will come... when this cub will drag you by your whiskers... or I know nothing about people. This was the first of the Mowgli stories. Rudyard Kipling MOWGLI KIDNAPPING The first chapter told the story of a little boy Mowgli... who avoided falling prey to the tiger Shere Khan and was adopted by a pack of wolves. Good hunting! Good hunting! Like this. Here is a running deer. Approach it from the side... Charge! Attack! A poor job. Once more. Why are you running on 2 legs, when you have 4? Calm down, Iron-Paw! I run better on 2 legs. Of course he does. He is a Man, after all. I'm a wolf! A wolf of the Free Tribe. Silly cub! You should learn to jump and climb better. It's not easy, Mowgli. Nicely done! Nicely done! Well done, Mowgli! Well done! Behave yourself, Mowgli. I didn't want to skin his hide. Insolent cub! Calm down, Iron-Paw! He's only a Man, after all. They wanted to capture Shere Khan... but they captured Hathi instead. The wise Hathi. Oh Hathi, I'll help you! But what can you do, little frog. Little man, Mowgli. I can do this. A disgrace! Mowgli's running through the trees. A disgrace. A disgrace. A disgrace! Thank you, Mowgli. He will teach us how to do that too. Yes Mowgli, you really are a man. Of course he's a man. Just remember, Mowgli... Shere Khan knows that too. Goodbye, Mowgli. Goodbye. Good hunting! We don't hunt, silly! Good hunting to you! He can do everything. He knows everything. He's like us, but without a tail. I say... ...only a Man can be so careless. You don't know the Jungle dwellers. What should you do in this situation? We should growl! We should run away. What should you say? I... we... you... they... We are all of one blood. You... and I! He can do everything. He knows everything. He's like us without a tail. Hurry! Hurry! Put dead bats on my stupid head. - Oh, why didn't I warn him? - Hurry! I'm a foolish root-digger! Roll me into hives of wild bees! Give me to Kaa, the Python! Let's ask him for help. Yes! Oh yes! The mention of his name makes Bandar-log's tail shake. Be careful, Bagheera... Good hunting, Kaa. Good hunting to us all. One of us at least needs food. I'm as empty as a dry well. What a coincidence... We're in the middle of a hunt. Come with us, Kaa. If you wish, of course. We have a leader now. All the jungle will admire us. We're the cleverest in the jungle. We're a great tribe! We deserve admiration. We all say so, so it must be true. All jungle dwellers admire us. It's true! It's true! We're a great tribe. He's the smartest of all my pupils. And besides, we love him, Kaa. I also have known what love is. Now I will tell you a story. You'd better tell your story. The Bandar-log called you an earthworm. Where are they? We thought you knew. Look up, Baloo! I've seen the boy. He asked me to tell you... that he's in the Cold Caves. Thank you Chil the Hawk. I won't forget this. No need to thank me... Mowgli said the Master Word. He hasn't forgotten. He hasn't forgotten. Onward. So they called me a yellow fish? Yes, a fish. And also an earthworm. They called me a frog? Yes, a frog. And also an earthworm. Good hunting. Good hunting. Bagheera... I'm coming. Bagheera! I'm climbing! They almost tore me to pieces... Into 100 little bear cubs. So this is Mowgli. You look like a Bandar-log. I'm a wolf. I'm one of the Free Tribe. My kill shall be your kill. A brave heart... and a courteous tongue. Bandar-log... Can you see me? We can see you, Kaa. Sit still... and watch. Come one step closer. Closer! Let's go. What will happen here, is not for your eyes. Closer! A little longer, and I would have walked down his throat. Never again will I ask for Kaa's help. This was the second of the Mowgli stories. Rudyard Kipling MOWGLI AKELA'S LAST HUNT The preceding chapters were about the little boy Mowgli. who was adopted by a pack of wolves and learned the Laws of the Jungle. and about his friends and enemies. I am surprised... that such brave hunters... let themselves be lead by a dying wolf. I heard that at the Pack Council... you do not dare to look him in the eye. The Master of the Jungle... has probably eaten a cub. Of course he needs a rest. Mowgli! I shall devour that little frog. How strange, to see at your feet... something that used to cover your head. Do you like my new skin? - It's beautiful. - That's nothing. You should see it after a bath. So let's go for a swim. Wait! I am full. I'm lazy. Then I'll carry you! Hold on! Watch out! That's it, I'll show you. The shoulder! The arm... the knee! The head! The leg... the stomach! The chest! And now we'll go for a swim, Kaa! Well, what do you think? No, show me your whole body. Kaa! You have grown. You're agile and clever. And yet that is not enough. I am strong. No! You have weak claws and teeth. What have I to fear? Shere Khan. You need an iron tooth. - An iron tooth? - Yes. I know where to find it. What's all this for? Are these good to eat? Calm down, Mother Cobra. Calm down! This Man is my brother. Very well. What about the big city up there? The jungle is above our heads. The city is long gone. It was destroyed when my grandson was still young. Ah, yes, yes. I am very old. But still I cannot believe... that the great city has disappeared. Crawl up there, and you'll see for yourself. You are too young to teach me anything. I am the guardian of these treasures. And I will not leave them for an instant. But we don't want anything here... except maybe this iron tooth. Mother Cobra... Give it to me... and I'll bring you frogs to eat. Of course! Of course! I will give you all that you see here. But only while you are here. Thank you, Mother Cobra. Look around you... What is that there? Those men came to take the treasure away. I struck them in the dark, and they... But we don't need this treasure. Besides, I know the Master Word. There's only one master-word here, and it's mine. No man has walked out of here alive. Get back, or I'll strike your neck. Let her go, Kaa. She has outlived her poison. Rotted-out tree stump... Your treasure needs a new guardian. I am ashamed. Just kill me! It's lovely here! Hey, this is brighter than Bagheera's eyes. I am sorrowful to the end of my tail... that that rotted-out tree-stump scared me so much. Will you hunt with me today? I don't know how to thank you for this thing. I must see Bagheera. I have to show her the iron tooth. We've been looking for you. Quick, let's go hunting! Hey, beasts! Listen, everyone, and spread the word. Little Frog has a fearful iron tooth now! Flowers, vines and leaves of the jungle... The song of triumph sings to you! Run, you troop of monkeys... like a panicked mob! Take care now, Shere Khan, not to cross my path! Mowgli! Akela, let Mowgli go with us today. With us? Good hunting! Where did you get that? In the Cold Caves. Kaa helped me. Now I have no one to fear. Right, Bagheera? While we are with you, you have nothing to fear. But there is one thing in the world that is stronger than the iron tooth. The Red Flower! The Red Flower? Everyone fears it. Even you? Yes, even me. - And me. - Even Baloo. And Kaa. And Shere Khan. They are chasing a deer. They're chasing it towards us. No, they're chasing it along a different path. Towards the water! Let Akela show his strength. Move aside for the leader of the pack! Leap, Akela! The old wolf has missed! Akela has missed! There, beyond the river... near the Valley of the Reeds... lives the Red Flower. It can be small... and shy, like a moth... But if you anger it, it becomes strong... It grows taller than the trees... Then, there is no escaping from it. Wake up, Mowgli! Wake up! Akela has missed! The pack needs a new leader. To the Council Rock! No time to waste! Run, run, Mowgli! Quick! Get the Red Flower before it is too late. Akela has missed. What does the Law say? He is a Dead Wolf. We need to choose a new leader. For 12 years, I have led you in the hunt. You, Grey Brother, run to the rock. And you stay here. Now I have missed my kill. By Law, you have the right to kill me. Therefore I ask... who will come... to end the life of the Lone Wolf. We are of one blood, you and I. Hurry, hurry, Mowgli! Don't waste time with him. He'll die anyway. Give me that Man-cub! What has he to do with us? He's our brother. He has driven game for us. Shere Khan's right. Give the Man-cub to him. Give him up! Get rid of him! Now we can do no more, except fight. He is my brother. And my brother! Stop! Does Shere Khan lead the pack? Are you all jackals, to fawn on him? Silence, Man-cub! It smells like rotting flesh here. You have told me so often, that I am a Man... that I began to believe it. And so that you may see it better... Here! Take this! You said you would kill me... Look at me when I'm speaking to you! This is for Akela! Go now, singed jungle cat! Now, listen to me! Akela has missed... because of Shere Khan. You will not kill him. He will remain leader of the pack. Mowgli, a Man. This was the 3rd of the Mowgli stories. Rudyard Kipling MOWGLI THE BATTLE Left... right... up... down... here... there. We're finished. I'm exhausted. They're coming! Are there many of them? They are flowing like a roaring red river. Oh, we are finished! Thank you, Chil. You've always been a trusted eye of the pack. We are of one blood. O, Free Tribe... the Red Dogs are coming this way. Each of the Red Dogs is weaker than a wolf. But there are too many of them. Even Hathis himself moves aside from their path. Even so, it is better to die in a fair fight... than to die running away. There will be a great hunt. Although for many... it will be their last. What do you say? It's all because of Mowgli! We accept the fight! We accept the fight! We accept the fight! We accept the fight! We accept the fight! We have to warn our friend. I'm going to tell the python. Where are you going? Be careful, Mowgli! "We accept the fight!" they shouted. And that cursed Mowgli, shouted the loudest. The fools! They've forgotten the Law of the Jungle. "Every creature for himself." We are going north, to wait till it's over. We are going north! We are going north! When we return there will be no one left. Only the white bones of Mowgli. Only his white bones. Poor Mowgli. Foolish little Mowgli... You have spoiled my hunt. How can you talk about hunting? Have you gone deaf from old age? The red dogs are coming! We accept the fight! The Red Dogs? Yes... It will be good hunting! Only afterward... there will be neither the Man-cub left, nor Kaa. Wise Kaa... Have you fallen asleep? Let me think. Kaa... Follow me. These are wild bees. Why did we come here? Watch. A certain old fat, deaf python... will wait for the Man-cub. You are telling me to pull Death by the whiskers? Well, Kaa... you are indeed wisest of all the jungle. Many have said so. Go! And for your sake, I will get word to the pack. They will certainly follow me. Watch out! Mowgli has many little thorns under his tongue... to prick the hide of each Red Dog. They will certainly follow me. Certainly, Kaa! Hey, you! Red Dogs! Who asked you to come here? We are Masters of the Jungle. Red Dog! Red rat! Go home, eater of dead lizards! It's not time yet, Mowgli. Well, Master of the Jungle, can't you get me? Tell your dogs to go home, and eat worms and frogs. I don't need any guards. Are you pleased, Red Dog? I'll tear out your stomach myself! It's time. Take your tail! Hey, where are you going? I'm here! It was good hunting. I saved your life a a long time ago, Little Frog. Now you have saved the pack. Get me on my feet. O, Free Pack... I am going to the Valley of Death. You need a new leader... young, strong... And wise. I speak of Mowgli. And now... I shall sing.... my last song. That was the 4th of the Mowgli stories. Rudyard Kipling MOWGLI THE RETURN TO PEOPLE Bagheera... Why do I feel like howling... as if I missed catching my prey. And right away you feel like laughing and jumping like the Bandar-log? Here... listen... what is that? That's your heart. A Man's heart. Only a Man's heart can feel such sorrow and such joy. You're just sitting around, while the melon patches are dry. So what? "So what!?" Try to dive in the pool below the bee rocks. No, that stupid water is disappearing. I don't want to crack my skull. Pity. A small crack might let in some wisdom. Prickly Sahi has brought bad news. This tree never lies. The Great Thirst... The Great Thirst is coming to the jungle. The sun is killing the jungle... for a distance of 3 days flight. Water Truce! Water Truce! Hathi has proclaimed the Water Truce! Go to the drinking places without fear... in the time of the Great Thirst. Don't be afraid! Killing during the thirst is punishable by death. If it weren't for the Water Truce... Peace, there... Peace! We are all under one law. If only I could learn to enjoy chewing branches! I very much wish that you would! Well spoken! When the truce ends... that shall be remembered in your favour. This is blood! This is blood! You butcher...! Have you not heard what Hathi trumpeted? You have broken the Law of the Jungle! Broken the law. Peace, there! Abide by the Law of the Truce. I am too full today. We are too full today. Speak, Grey Brother. He's been hiding for a month. He stole a buffalo from Men to cover his tracks. Get to the point! He's in the Cold Ravine. Everything is ready. Yes, it's time! Drive the buffaloes towards the foot of the ravine. I'm going to the head of the ravine. We are of one blood... you and I... Buffaloes! They are running straight into our jaws. You fool! Who can stand against the whole herd? Who was that? Well, Little Frog... It's time to remember the Red flower. I have always told him... "You will cast your skin, but you won't get to grow a new one." I also told him... that this little frog will repay his debt. Teacher... I don't recognise the jungle... The year has turned. It is always... like that... in the Spring. Look... how beautiful the world is. At such a time... I am sorry... that I was not born... a butterfly... or a flower. O, great Kaa... I thought this was happening to me alone. Listen... how my heart is beating. That is... because of the Spring. I don't know what this is. But I can't stand it! Yes.... that means... he has grown up. He was my best pupil. What a foolish joke. I don't know what's happening to me. It's alright... These are tears. Yes... It isn't easy to shed old skin. I would not go... but something is calling me. Though I cannot now see... the trees in front of me... I see far... And I'm telling you... you are right. The time has come. Follow your own path. Make your lair with your own blood... and pack, and people. I... taught you... the Law. We are... of one blood. We are of one blood, you and I. O, Free Pack... I have kept my word. The time has come... and I am going back to my own. You need a new leader. We need a leader. You need a new leader. I am... leaving. If there is need, Mowgli... for a sharp eye... for a sharp tooth... a sharp claw... a sharp wit... a wise... word... Remember that the jungle is yours, Mowgli. That was the 5th and last of the Mowgli stories. Synched and revised by FatPlank
