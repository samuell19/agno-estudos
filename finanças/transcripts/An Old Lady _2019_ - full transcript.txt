Produced by KIRIN PRODUCTIONS IV pole on that side, please lie down when ready. Uh, yes. But I can't... Oh, I'll give you a hand. Head this way. Thank you. - All by yourself tonight? - Today's my last day so... Hold on. Which side? Right side, knee. Right knee. Let me pull up the trousers. Did you swim long? Yes? It was in the chart that you exercise. Oh, yes. When you're old. There aren't many options with weak knees. You'll feel the heat soon. Okay. You have very pretty legs. Maybe it's the swimming? No one could guess your age from behind. How, how much longer? I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable. Oh, I was just wondering. Just in case I have to go. I see. Nine more minutes. Sorry you have to work on Sundays because of old people like me. Work is work. And you don't look old, at all. Why do you laugh? I remember telling the same lie to old people. It's not a lie. An Old Lady Why did you check out by yourself? I could have helped you with these. Or were you trying to catch me swimming without you? You were! Well, I almost let you down. What do you mean? I almost decided to skip today to go pick you up early. You've gotten so fast. Were you looking? Yes, but I'll catch up soon enough. OMG. I can't believe I'm talking with a published poet. I wonder where the book is. It's my favorite pot coaster. So doctor said there's no need for a follow-up? He did. I guess they're as good as people say. I'm going inside, Mr. NAM. Lookie here. Can you please stop calling me Mr. NAM? Would you prefer Mr. Boss? Book Sarang Good day, sir! Oh, hello. Aren't we out of toothpaste? No, not for me. Mr. NAM, did you take your medicine? Ah, I forgot. What a fashionista. What? Your socks. I hear real fashionistas wear mismatching socks? A worn-out sock on a washing line. Sunlight glistens on its teardrop. From your poem. Oh. Are we all set to go? I didn't know you read my book. Are you sure you don't want to go to the ER? Yes. You didn't even eat much. What could've gone wrong? I feel better now. Go back to bed. I made some honey tea. Come and have a sip. What happened to your wrist? A nurse was clumsy with needles. Ouch. Remember that time when I made ramyeon for you? When I was working as your caregiver at the hospital? If that nurse caught us, she would've had me fired. And we wouldn't be here. I would've tracked you down. Persuaded you to work at my bookstore. What made you think of that? Mr. NAM. I think I should report the nurse to the police. What? Why? For being clumsy with needles? Will you come with me? What about something to read? What made you start a bookstore business? Aren't libraries better for reading? You could afford to. It was Hyeon-su's mom. I asked her which she preferred. Owner of fried chicken diner or a bookstore. She chose the bookstore. She knew you well. She knew which talent you lack. I like the name of the place. Book Sarang? That's on previous owner. Number 358? Your form, please? What form? There are forms over there. This is where you submit after completing them. But we waited for so long. Come straight to me. I'll take it for you. Thank you. Sir! Are you a victim yourself? I am. Then you need to fill out a complaint report yourself, okay? Okay. Can you get me something warm to drink? Of course. What did you have in mind? Anything warm. Type of Crime: ex. Rape Hey. What happened? It's done. Already? So what now? A detective will be put on the case and give a call. To you, directly? Today? I see. Your student's wedding this weekend, I think I should pass. Why? Because of Hyeon-su? Never mind him. I wouldn't feel comfortable. Let's get you a haircut. You should look clean and tidy for the event. Alright. Can you do it? You cut my hair when I was your patient. You're going as a teacher and a wedding officiator. We should hire a professional. And you don't remember the name? Two persons checked out to be on duty that night. A female student nurse and a physical therapist. Hmm. The nurse was at the desk on the ground floor mostly. This is the physical therapist. LEE Joong-ho, he was on shift till next day noon. Ah. What? You recognize the name? This LEE, any criminal record? No, sir. What, born in 1984? How old does that make him? Twenty-nine this year. Crazy bastard. And he's actually a nursing assistant. Just mostly assigned to a physical therapist. The head nurse says he's one of the most hospitable staff. Huh. Hospitality pushed too far. Excuse me? Do you think that's appropriate? That came out wrong. And Mr. NAM. What's your relationship to the complainant? I see you're not husband and wife. How is that relevant to the case? You seem to be assuming the role of her guardian. - Mr. NAM's been... - We live together. I see. This is it for today. I'll contact you after I get statements from the staff and Mr. LEE. Let's head over now. Is he at work? Yes, he is on duty. Wait! Mr. NAM taught here for a long time and knows many people. Yes, of course. We won't be making a scene, it's not a murder. Detective LEE, go ready the car. Yes, sir. Uh, do you happen to have an evidence? Like an underwear with semen? Yes, I do. Take your time. Don't wait for me. I'll take a bus. I'll be here. This! It's him, isn't it?! You're hurting me. I'm sorry. This will get better. Go on and open the store. We should open at regular hours, or we'll get complaints. Promise me you'll go straight home and get some rest. By the way... Is there a family that should know about this? No. Hi, there! On your way out? I don't think I saw you in the pool? Like you were looking at anything other than the coach. That's not true. I'm cutting it short today, a numb arm. Good-bye. Alright, see you around. Did you notice her figure? She's really in shape. I know. Ah... Is she okay? Are you okay? Is it the arm? Come and sit down. No, don't. I'll massage the arm for you. Please, stop! It's a rude thing to say even to old people. Hyu Orthopedics Ms. KIM Kyeong-mi. Ms. HAN Seung-ae. Mr. LEE. Hey, ma'am! What brings you here? Sprained my ankle. Again? Poor you. Mr. LEE Joong-ho? Let's go. Are you asleep? I see. That can't be helped. The complaint has been accepted. No, the inspection will be carried out after the warrant. - Detective LEE! - Sir! - Show Ms. SHIM to the restroom. - Sure, this way please. I'll go with her. Mr. NAM, if you don't mind. There was no rape. It was consensual. Why? Why did you do it? I thought maybe you owned the hospital, but no. Could you spare a settlement? A fine looking man like you. Why did you do it? How did it start? I don't imagine one of you went, let's have sex now! He knew she had no company that night. He planned the whole thing! It wasn't like that. She complained of pain and begged me to call her in. Why would she need to beg? It's a required therapy! I'm only an assistant, you know. I work on therapist's orders and it was too late to get one. But she said she couldn't sleep. She was recovering from surgery! Who forces on someone like that? I didn't force anything. We'll go back to that later. How long did it take? How long till the ejaculation? What? Am I abusing your rights? The time of your ejaculation is an important detail of my case. I don't know the exact time. But she became agitated when the timer went off, so I... And after that? She told me to leave first, so I did. Where are we with the evidence? It'll take time. And the evidence won't prove the matter of coercion. Did you ever... Do you recognize this face? Why do you ask? His address of residence is in the complainant's neighborhood. It's his friend's place but still... He says he's been staying there for over a year now. I don't recall seeing him. He says he saw you last Christmas. The two of you at the mart. He says he spoke to the complainant then. And recommended the hospital. What? What did she say? That's why I wanted to talk to you. Did the complainant look forgetful to you recently? Did she act differently? Why would you ask? I live with my parents. They get tested for dementia every year. You know, just in case. What are you trying to accomplish? Hear me out. Detective. I don't know what he suggested but he is lying. She used to work as a caregiver. And her ex-colleague recommended the hospital. A SONG Mi-ja. The name came up in the statement so we checked. Her agency confirms that there is no record of SONG Mi-ja. That can't be. There must be. Look... I think it would be better hearing it from you, not me. I'll bring her in, so please. Then... What happens to the warrant? We'll hear from the court by tomorrow. They'll probably issue an arrest warrant. Mr. NAM? I'm sorry, I drifted off. Good riddance! Pink isn't my color. Hyeon-su's wife got me this for their wedding. I hated wearing it. You did me a favor. Mr. NAM, do you believe me? What? Why would you ask such a question? What if I really met him at the mart before? What if my memory can't be trusted? That's impossible. Hello, Detective GOH. So what happens now? Detective... Are you saying they'll dismiss the warrant again? Sexual Assault Center I was in session. I see, okay. Remember, no alcohol for you. You have a doctor's appointment next month. If you end up having a drink or two, hire a driver okay? A cab? There's a bus that goes straight home from here. Alright, okay. Home... Hyu Orthopedics You've reached your destination. End of directions. Haneul Lodge Outpatient office hours are over. I was wondering if SONG Mi-ja was ever a patient here. Why do you ask? She's a friend and I can't reach her. She lives alone and I'm worried. Did you say SONG Mi-ja? That's right. What is it? She's asking after a patient. Oh...? Do you know her phone number? I tried calling but she's not answering. Maybe she changed the number. Ms. LEE! Didn't you learn anything about privacy and confidentiality? I'm sorry, ma'am. Do you want this probation to be the end of your career? Sorry, ma'am. I'm sorry but you're putting us in a very difficult position. You could get her fired. Can you really live with that? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. LEE Joong-ho Seong-woo, stay in your lane! Come back here! Mr. LEE Joong-ho! You know me, right? Can I help you? Security will be patrolling soon. Can I talk to you in private? What is this? Confess. We'll ask the court to go easy on you. Are you done? Mr. LEE! Please! Did she put you up to this? Mr. LEE! If you confess to the crime, I'll make a plea for mercy. Please. Didn't you hear from the detective today? - The court... - Never mind the court! What about your conscience? I can see why you need to do this. I feel sorry for you. But I can't confess to something that didn't happen. If you please, I'm working tomorrow. What? You what? You hurt your own patient. Work? You should be locked up! You didn't recognize me, did you? You never spoke to her at the mart. You're a liar! Check the security cameras from the mart yourself! I was at Ganghwado Island today. I didn't know your ID address was your in-laws' place. So your father-in-law doesn't approve of you? And you're saving up for rent and marriage? So what? What did you say to them? I was only a visitor today. But I won't be the next time if you don't confess. Are you threatening me? I'm imploring you. Please, do the right thing. Hey! Go ruin someone else's life! Blind as a corpse. Go get a coffin and lie yourself in! Letter of accusation LEE Joong-ho, a nursing assistant, is a criminal He's awake. Please get rid of the letter. Granny, come down to eat. I'm coming! Grandpa, I appreciate having a job. But haven't you been enough trouble to daughter? Have you picked out a car yet? Dad, I'm getting a divorce. I see. So... I can give you rides to the hospital. I'll bring your stuff over after the trial. Go on, Mr. Lawyer. Okay, okay. Dad, you remember what day it is tomorrow? Huh? Oh, yes. Thank you sir. Sure. Mr. NAM, you do look good in pink The business isn't as good? I'm thinking Jeju Island, when Dad's gone. Yeah? What's there? A friend. She made a very generous offer as her kid's nanny. Her mom's gone and she's been whining ever since. How nice. I have no one. Can you spare me one? The stairs almost killed you. And I still need your help. OMG. Did you just say OMG? It's hilarious coming from you. Why did you come back to us? No one else wants me. There was no word from your daughter. I looked. I wanted to do something nice for you, but... I guess she's busy with her life. Hey. You know, he mostly doesn't recognize me. See your daughter as much as you can while you can. Okay? Boss! We have a customer! Finally, now we're open. Here, take a drag. To hell with life. That's no way to talk to an old person. He's not handsy like before, is he? Go on. The name is SHIM Hyo-jeong. She was dispatched to Samil 6 years ago. She's sixty-nine this year so probably 1944. I see, thank you. Partner Agencies for Samil University Hospital Really! Yes, thank you so much. Clean up after yourself, for Christ's sake. I'm so sorry. I was in a hurry, I forgot to... Of course, please go. There's plenty of trash here. You think you'll never get old! I wasn't even talking to that old man. I was talking to myself. He got all fired up and started swinging that crutch around! See this bruise? You need to calm down, sir. This incident is being processed so... I see you're healthy and well. No words from the complainant? Detective. Why was the warrant rejected again? I'm not sure. The polygraph result was in her favor but... No such luck... She stopped taking my calls since the news. I wanted to do a cross-examination, as a last straw. Do you have any idea where she might be? The case will be sent to the prosecutor's after this. What happens then? You'll have to continue the fight in court. I heard she's on antidepressants. I hope she's not getting ideas. Antidepressants? You didn't know? The counsellor mentioned it. She asked if we offer a dementia test when she was here. I was glad she brought it up. Please. Thank you. As you can see, there are no worrying signs yet. But a long term medication can be a cause of dementia. So she should take care. Do you know why she's on medication? I'm sorry but I can't disclose personal information. Even if you were her husband, I couldn't share without her consent. But I can tell you this. Despite the long-term prescription, the level of reliance was very low. Her workout routine seemed to help a lot. We don't see that much. Is it her swimming? Yes. She said she tried everything when she was young. She stopped most of them because of age and weakness. Swimming is all she has left. Why is it so hard to get a warrant? Is there anything I can do? I wish things were different. But victims have to prove a rape. Even if everything is clearly taped. Pianos & Instruments Discount Shop Dad, what are you doing? You surprised me! What brings you here? It slipped my mind. Where are those ceremonial plates? Where can they be? Ah, here they are. Oh, did you get Seoul Makgeolli ? That's all your mom would drink. Are you still seeing her? Never mind us. I wish I could. But look you. You know what? Since you brought it up... I actually could use your help. You're a lawyer. Maybe you can make better sense out of this. Look here. The polygraph results also say she's telling the truth. But look at the grounds of warrant dismissal. They say it's improbable for a young man to... Dad, really? I understand why you are upset. But you're a lawyer. Doesn't it bother you? That justice is not being served? How can you be sure? What? Dad. I don't object to you living with her. I'm going through stuff myself. And maybe she makes my life easier in some ways. But that doesn't mean I have to care about her private life. Private life? Hyeon-su, we're talking of a crime! Couldn't it wait for some other day? Her counsellor agrees! She couldn't have fought off anyone with those frozen shoulders. You know, Dad. Your whole life is just about you and what you want. Dad. Look at this house. There's not a thing that I or Mom wanted. I'll see after Mom. I'm sorry to have bothered you. He's right. You wanted to get a round table. I insisted on this. Lucky you. Last year, she said she envied you. For not knowing about becoming old. I thought it was some female psychology. But... Again, Granny? Isn't it too often? Let me have a look. Please go see a doctor. Somewhere big, like a university. Hey, Ms. SHIM. I thought I'd find you here. Long time no see. What's the occasion? Just me? What is it? You know she worshipped supplements? Myocardial infarction took her. She was brought here. It shook me up a bit. Hey. Did Mi-ja lend money from you? Oh... An old man came asking after her the other day. So we thought she was being chased by creditors. You haven't changed a bit. No one would guess you're a working girl. Do you know why the agency would say they don't know Mi-ja? They must keep records. She's not from a partner agency. They're not cheap so some patients hire their own. We don't always tell. So your knees are better? What? Mi-ja and you used to wear matching comfort shoes. Because of bad knees. Oh, so did you ever check out my in-law's hospital? What? Hyu Orthopedics? So you did? That hospital, that was your recommendation? Yeah, for the both of you. Why, what is it? Will you be able to help me? Please understand. I see you lost weight. You should always watch out for yourself. I should? I didn't mean... So it's my fault? Ms. SHIM, your scarf. Excuse me. Your scarf. Oh. Here you go. Thank you. It's so warm in here I couldn't keep it on. Right? It's really warm in here. Lookie here. I need your help. I'm lost. We should be looking at the price tags. The festivities begin from picking a wine. I'm trying to do it right. You're not even religious. You really don't remember seeing LEE Joong-ho at the mart? It's not that I don't remember, I never met him. He says it was around Christmas. No, I don't know him. I wouldn't forget a person who'd recommend me a hospital. Hey, you're back? I enjoyed the food. Yeah, thanks. Ms. SHIM, you never pick up my calls. Will you see me out, please? Sorry, it'll just be a second. Take your time. Have you known the owner long? Yes. Advanced patients have hard time finding help. I had to find a place on a short notice. We saved each other. I see. You look good today, by the way. I don't know fashion but I can see you're a good dresser. Can I expect you at the station tomorrow? If the victim were a young woman, would he be in custody by now? A good dresser? How do you see me, Detective? Sorry? What do you mean? All I think of when I dress is, do I look easy? Would random men make a pass at me? Would you say I'm safe in these clothes? I don't ever want to see him, ever again. This is Detective GOH. She's here like you said. We just spoke. I'm not sure if she'll come tomorrow. The owner of the diner says she saw a letter of accusation. Do you know anything about it? Ally Diner Lookie here. You told me why you started wearing these. Is it him you're working for? It doesn't concern you, Mr. NAM. But, no, no. This isn't right. You can't stay here. Come back, come with me. Keep it down, please. This is all I have. I have nowhere else to go. Anywhere is better than here, isn't it? There's nowhere. I'm sorry. I did have doubts. But it never mattered. I'm sure. Please don't dig up something so below you. I lied. I have a daughter. Her name is Sarang. Huh. It must've been hard, every time you came to the store. No, I loved it more for that. Good-bye. Is the room warm? Lookie here. Don't you give up! Never! Letter of Accusation Late night yesterday? Yeah, it was fun. This way. Wait in the interrogation room. How have you been? What can I do for you? The day of your father's accident. You said you saw the camera footage. Yes, I did. Can you tell me the address to the lodge? I don't think it'll do you any good. I know. But I can't just do nothing. Yes. No, I forgot about Dad's hospital visit. Yes. No, I can make it to the trial. Hey, I have a question. The Act on Sexual Crimes, when was it enacted? 2010? So less than two years now. Yeah. So, umm... It's applicable to a senior who's assessed as a disabled, right? Right. I think the police is treating it as a typical rape. Sorry, I'll call you back. Hey, Dad. What's in the bag? Nothing special. Things I need for the store. I thought you didn't like pink. Huh? I like this one. Dad. Yeah? Ms. SHIM came by today morning. What? Why? She should be at the cross-examination. No, she shouldn't be. Sexual victims shouldn't have to face their offenders. Ah. What did she want from you? She reminded me of your appointment. Dad. I don't think she'll give in. Put on your seat belt. Haneul Lodge That is so wrong. It's your day off. The hospital is practically bullying you. Seriously. I know. My friends tell me the same thing. They know you can't afford to say no. Oh, did you get that strawberry cake? Okay. Mom? She's busy in the kitchen. She didn't expect you till supper. So when will you arrive? Did you call us earlier today? You're welcome to come in. Mom, he'll be here in 20 min. Already? I haven't even started yet. Honey? Joong-ho will be here soon. Will you see to our guest? Haneul, help me out in the kitchen. Joong-ho, come quick before she sends me to catch a hen. Please, take a seat. I keep telling you. Pregnant woman should always wear socks. Or you get joint pains afterwards. And stop playing games. Prenatal education is important. My ears are going to bleed. She doesn't know what's good for her. Go get your own place and leave us in peace. I thought you wanted us around to help you after I finish college? Where are you coming from? I said where? Haneul Lodge. Did you talk to Haneul? You're out of your mind! The pack of you! What did you say to her? What did you say to her? You won't find it in there. Letter of accusation LEE Joong-ho, a nursing assistant, is a criminal Have you lost your mind? Do you really not remember? I did it for you as a favor! You really are a bastard. Are you trying to ruin my life? Ruin? A life doesn't get ruined all of a sudden. It drowns you little by little. You'll wish it were over. But life is really stubborn. You bitch! On Holiday Didn't I warn you? Look in the dressing room. Is it there? Hold on. Hello. Come in and take a look. Yes, yes. I told you so. You know there's food? Soup is on the stove. I got a customer. Okay sweetie, talk to you after school. Hey. Come again. Letter of accusation My story may make many feel uncomfortable. But still, I try to gather up the courage speak. I guess it's because I am still here. I have many regrets. I'm used to running away. Spring Sun by NAM Dong-In Hiding in the shadow hoping to be forgotten. A worn-out sock on a washing line Sunlight glistens on its teardrop I learned a poem. It said spring sun shines even on a teardrop. Telling my story is not easy. But this is me. Taking a step into the sun. I'm SHIM Hyo-jeong, aged 69. A nursing assistant LEE Joong-ho raped me.
