I didn't understand a word. - Not even the odd word? - Not even. But did you like the music of it? - You're translating that? - Yes. I only read you the end. - It's called "Elegy for the Egg". - "Elegy for the Egg". - What's it about? - Well, I'll read you the bit I've just translated: "The self tries to get out of the self, "the eye from the eye and still one's self "settles upon itself heavy, like black snow. "From one egg to another, larger, you are forever being born, "wing that has never flown. "Only from sleep can we awaken "from the skin of life, no-one, ever." Not bad! What a nice smell. - What are you making? - White wine jelly with aniseed, cinnamon and cardamon. To go with the cheese tomorrow. Smells good. Not as good as you do, just here. I love it when you tell me I smell good. What do I smell of? Coffee, of course, with the amount you drink. Your poem has made me hungry. Shall we make an omelette? If you like. The era of poetry did not last since then only instruction leaflets user manuals reports "international epidemiological "survey into the use of ambulatory "blood pressure monitoring" always the words of others you say it's the last time that you want to write your own words but you'll never write I know that it's too late now it is not words that will come out of you Will you give me a quick massage? Ok. But you have to go and get the oil. I've got to get up anyway. I'm applying at the restaurant "Ramequin Délicieux" tomorrow. They need a pastry chef. What? I hope you get the job! There's no reason why I shouldn't. I got the sweet almond oil, ok? Mustard oil would've been better. It suits you better. But sweet almond will do. No! Stop! No, not there I've just had a pee! Exactly, that's when I like it best. Why have you stopped? - Didn't you want a massage? - Yes, but... Go on, roll over on your front and I'll knead you a bit. But you can't just stop now. Don't worry. You'll see, it'll be really good. Afterwards, we'll get back to your little treat. You sigh this file is endless the very last file you think your fingers fly over the keys without a thought and I see those fingers and I know the rest all that is hidden under your old jumper all of it! your hand so smooth your wrist unadorned your arm always white the sharp shoulders I've explored every nook of your body I have breathed it kneaded it licked it this body never revealed to anyone other than me What? D'you fancy eating razor clams tonight? I don't know. What are they? These things here. I can't see, you're too far away. These things. Look, they're everywhere. Can you eat them? These are empty. But we can try the market. How do you prepare them? First, you have to leave them to soak, then you fry them in a bit of butter, garlic, shallots and parsley. This one's really beautiful. Yes. But look, it's really sharp! What's wrong with you! Sorry, sorry. - That hurts! - I'm really sorry. - Look, I'm bleeding. - Wait, let's see your finger. - No. - Go on, show me your finger. No. I know you're going to put it in your mouth! It'll make it better. Put it in your own mouth, then. - I don't like the taste of blood. - Well... let me do it. That's soooo good. - What? - Nothing. - What did you say? - You'll just have to learn. I don't have time. - I should have when I was out of work. - Why didn't you? Look. It's better now. Shall we go eat those razor clams? Yes and I know too that the child that will come from you will be as I see him as I know him to be when I beat together sugar flour eggs I know what will come out of the oven last night you told me "I want to write" that's what you think you imagine You'll see, the food's really good here. I've been a few times before, it's excellent. And it's a beautiful place, isn't it? Are you ok? - I was lost in my thoughts. - Care to share? I'm going to give up translating, I think. It was interesting at first, but for 3 years now it's just paid the bills. Now that we're better off, I could do something else. What would you like to do? Write. Really? In the past it's never turned out right. I feel ready now. Well... that's great! When do you want to start? I'll finish the medical report tomorrow and then I'll move on. Your Sancerre. Perfect. To us! Happy anniversary. It's good, isn't it? Four years. And everything's all right? Apart from the writing thing, I mean. Yes, of course! You know... I don't know about you, but I really want us to have a baby. Don't you? - Straight away? - Well, you are thirty-two. - Charming. - Don't get upset, sweetie. - But I'm still young. - I know. I never said you weren't. Having children late in life isn't too good. Especially for the child. I'm not ready. I haven't done anything yet. You'll get used to the idea. Soon it'll seem like the natural thing to do. You'll be able to take the time to write while you're pregnant. That'll be good, won't it? It was yesterday your fingers stop the words have been made to fit standing in front of your computer you do not look at me you take off your sweater your mottled breasts act as if I weren't there you slip off your pants naked you look your body up and down you grab the skin of your crotch tearing it off the skin comes away exposing your flesh your blood your organs the network of your veins no skin left on your belly or your legs or your arms or your face nowhere save on the floor you observe the hide lying on the ground at last you raise your eyes your blood is pumping through your veins red and blue the rhythms of your heart I see it beating beneath your ribs in the juddering of your lungs and I see the air moving the muscles of your arms glisten the fat of your breasts the vibrations of your intestines the chattering of your jaw the rolling of your eyeballs the creaking of your bones so much blood you pick up the skin you come closer to me this is not the you I knew you hold out the skin to me you say here it's yours and you leave Subtitling Titra Film Paris NAO!
