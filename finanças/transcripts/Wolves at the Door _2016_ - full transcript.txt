Honey. Honey, wake up. - What is it? - Wake up. It sounds like somebody's knocking. All right. Hit the lights. What are you doing? Stay right here, Mary. What was it? It was nothing. Come on. Come here. God. What is that? I'm calling the police. Hi, I'm at 3301 Cameron Street. I think somebody is trying to break into our house. Who's down there? Little pig. Oh, God! They're in here. John, there's someone out there! LAPD! I'm coming in! - Don't shoot! Don't shoot! - Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Detective Clarkin. The missus says she got a visual, but she's fuzzy on details. It was dark. She was upstairs looking down through her window. Said she was pretty sure she saw a white female, but couldn't guarantee. She's still a little shaken, but, uh, maybe when she calms down a little... Every day it's something new here. At least the weather's nice. - Those the home owners? - Yeah. Right this way. Think of any reason someone might wanna do this to you? No. Disgruntled employee, upset family member, neighbor? No! No! No one we know would do something like this. Of course. Had to ask. There's been a rash of home invasions over the past few weeks, so I'm sure this was in connection with those. But who would do something like this? Runaways, hippies, radicals, dropouts. You name it, you got it all here in California. Look, I've got a few theories, but nothing I can share at the moment. The good news is, they've all been relatively minor infractions. People sneaking in, moving things around. Excuse me, Officer. This doesn't seem to be something minor. It certainly didn't feel minor. No. No, I'm sure it didn't. I admit, this one seems like they're stepping things up. Who knows what might have happened if you didn't call when you did. I just don't understand. They're crazy, dear. Crazy people do crazy things. Fuller. Party of three. Hola. This way, please. Make a wish. Happy birthday, Abby. My birthday is in October. - Ah. - Oh. We know. But aren't birthday parties so much more fun than going away parties? What? Not my idea. - What was your idea? - I don't know. Kidnap you. Keep you here forever and ever. - How sweet. - Thanks. Wait, wait, wait, wait. One more thing. What's a birthday party without presents? Sharon. Beautiful. Aw. - I took it when we were... - I know. It's Zuma. Our beach. It's beautiful, Sharon. We always said it had a mystical hold over us. Yeah. This is actually where we first met. You remember that? - Yeah. - That bonfire party? That was a good party. Credit where credit's due. In this case, to me. I'm gonna miss that beach. - And we're gonna miss you. - Yeah. So, when you get sick of Boston and decide to come back, it'll be the first place that we go. Thank you. I love it. Sharon, who's here now? Thank you. Thank you. You promised you weren't gonna throw a party. And I kept my promise. But you know how it is. People show up whenever they feel like it. Well, maybe you should rethink that policy when the baby arrives. That song haunts me. It just does. Mmm-mmm-mmm. Nothing else to say but that. Sixteen minutes before 11:00. This is the HJB program, where we have a good time all the time. We're gonna bop around all night having fun, doing things, you know. Stick around for your favorite blues and R&B tunes. 72 degrees in Los Angeles right now, 76 in the Valley. Okay, just tell me what's going on. I have no idea what's going on. But let's find out. Sharon! You can't just look in there. What? Yes. I'm just investigating. It's fine. Sorry. Is William around? He rents the guest house. It's just right around there. Thanks. You know, you look familiar. You don't. You sure we've never met each other? If we did, you'd remember. I can promise you that. I'll definitely remember for the next time, then. You two take care, now. Needs a few years to mature, but overall, not bad. Oh, my God. You're terrible. What's gonna happen after I'm gone? Who's gonna keep you in line then? Aw. You don't have to go, Abs. You could stay here. There's plenty of room. And then what? And then... Ah, who knows? Isn't that the exciting part about life? See, you say something like that, and fireworks go off. I say something like that and I'd get a flat tire. - Oh, don't be silly. - It's true. Guys! Turn on the lights when you come in, will you? Jay? Wojciech? You guys? You won't believe the clarity, man. Dig that platter. That tonearm? That's new, too. The old model had that clunky plastic one. Remember that? It's really far out, Steve. Four speeds. Volume. Tone controls. What more could you need? Am I right? How does it sound? Oh, out of sight, man. But are you sure you wanna hear her? Yeah. Why wouldn't I? Because as soon as you hear this beauty no way are you letting me leave here with her. I've got the scratch, if that's what you're asking. Here, put these on. After this, you won't need acid to see the music, man. Okay. Won't hurt though, right? Not a bit, man. What'd you do that for? He who pays the piper calls the tune. What does that mean? Means, you gonna pony up the dough for it, or what? Hi, Mom. You're up late. I know. Yes, I know. I'm excited to see you, too. Yeah. Huh? Oh, I did. The dress was delivered today. Yeah, right, just in time. It's... It's beautiful. I'll wear it tomorrow. Thank you. Okay, get some sleep. I love you, too. - I guess fashion really is dead. - We should bury it. Let's go get some shovels. She's making me wear it tomorrow. Hey, who's that chick that lives up at the main house? She looked familiar. Uh, she's been in a bunch of movies and TV shows. You, like, party with her ever? Sometimes, yeah. She and her old man got a real vibe going on up there, so... People come and go. We good? All right. Peace, man. Fourth of July was over a month ago. What are people thinking? I don't know. End of summer, maybe? People use any excuse to blow stuff up. So, you wanted to talk? Mmm. Mmm, yeah. No. I don't know anymore. You don't know what? I feel... I feel like maybe I had you figured out all wrong somehow. How so? Because I never figured you to be the sort of trust fund girl who would go crawling back to mommy and daddy as soon as they threatened to stop sending the dough. I'm not crawling back to them. Oh, no. They're flying you first class. That's bad. I'm sorry. I'm not leaving because my parents threatened to cut me off. I'm leaving because I feel like it's time to move on. I don't fit in here. This whole city is populated by people who feel like they don't fit in. Look, I never told you this, but a year ago, I was gonna give up. Just pack it all in. But then I convinced myself to give it another couple of weeks. What happened? I met you on that beach. And it was then I decided that I was gonna give myself as long as it takes. Because no matter what happens with the business and all that, there was always Abigail. No, Wojciech, you... You can't make me responsible for your dreams, too. I'm not. I'm not. I'm just trying to convince you to stay, so you don't give up on yours. There's a reason that you don't fit in. It's not because you're different. It's absolutely because you're special. I wish it could work out, Wojciech. It's not even late, Amy. Plus, I know Abby would love to see you before she leaves. I could use you as well. I don't wanna be alone when she goes. Especially right away. No. Because they're boys. And plus, Jay pretends like I'm not even... Hello? Hello? Hello, hello. Shit. Come on, man. Out of the way! No, no, please. I have money. - Jay. - Sorry. Sorry. Are those the fireworks-- Oh, the fireworks that you threw away? You got them out of the trash? You threw away my fireworks, Sharon. - Sharon, Sharon. - Well, you nearly blew your hand off. It's just my finger! You're overreacting. It wasn't my hand. No, no, no! Not my couch. Not my couch. Doesn't look like that's a celebratory shot. Just don't. Phew. All right, listen. I got something for you that's gonna make you feel groovy, okay? And since we're all about "Sharon" around here... You take two of these, and it'll cure your heartache. No. Thanks, but no. Oh? All right. Well, if not this, there's one more thing I want you to try. Now, her name's Gloria, and she is all about sharing. Jay. Hey. Don't listen to him. I'm sorry girls are crazy. But I know her, and she'll come around. It's gonna be a little tough for her to come around given that she's in Boston. - Ignore him. - It's a long ways away. Where are you going? I could use a walk. I need some time to think. Oh, thank God. - Hey! You're just in time. - Hey. - Did you guys hear the... - I can't, what's that? Did you hear that? You gotta speak up because the blender's... Why would you do that? There was... Listen, if you're looking for Wojciech, he went on one of his long walks. Did you guys hear that knocking? What knocking? - Oh, God! Jay! - Oh, oh, oh, sorry! I'm sorry. I thought the lid was still on. Oh! You're already blitzed. That's probably Amy. I told her to come over. Will you let her in while I change? If it was Amy, wouldn't she just come to the front door? Abs, please, will you let her in? Amy? Amy? Amy? Mexico City. We left on Monday. - Where do you want to go? - San Lorenzo. How far is it? Do you know? Who knows how the bridges are? Maybe a couple of hours. A police car went by just before sundown. Ah! They didn't come back. So, maybe they got through okay. "The Big Boom." Who knows? The telephone lines are down since the earthquake. Thanks a lot. See you later... "The Bully." Holy shit. Hey, man. You all right? What the-- What the fuck! Who are you? Come on! Shit! Hey. Oh, my God! Shit. I'm sorry. - Sorry... - Abby. I'm sorry. What are you doing? I saw someone in the hallway. I swear she walked in here. - What? Who? - I... I don't know. She waved to me. So, I thought, maybe she was one of your friends. Is that her? I can't tell. Maybe. Freaky. She must be on some kind of a crazy trip. Who? Just this girl we saw. Is she cute? Where's Wojciech? Wojciech? Abby? Abby, come back inside. He's probably way down the canyon by now. He'll be back. Abby. No, don't. Stay inside. Can we calm down, please? You're really starting to freak me out. Good, because I'm already freaked out. I don't feel safe. We've gone through the house twice already. I just wanna be sure if they're outside, they stay outside. What was that? Jay? Jay? Wait. Jay? Jay! Sharon. Wojciech? Jay! What are they... No, I told you, stay inside. Be careful. What's happening? I don't know. Jay? Jay, this isn't funny. Jay. Jay! Jay! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No! No! No! Jay! Jay! No! No! No! No! - No! No! - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Run! - No! Sharon, get inside! No! No. No, please! Don't! No! No! No! Sharon! Sharon! No! Why? Why? No, please. Why? Don't do this to us! Oh, my God. - Sharon! - Wojciech! Wojciech! Shit. Where's Abby? Where is she? I don't know. I don't know, Wojciech. Please, talk to me. I don't know. I don't... Please, don't. Please. They're gonna kill us. No! No! Please. Don't... Don't kill my baby! Please. No! Please, don't! My baby! Please! Please! Please, don't! Please, don't do this! Please! No! Please, don't! No! Please, stop! No. No. Please, stop. No. Please, don't do this. Please, don't do this! Please. Please don't... Please don't hurt... Abby! Go! Go! Come on! Abby! Get help! No! William! Hey! William! Hey! William! Hey, hey. - No! - Abby, Abby, Abby! I'm so glad you're okay. Oh, my God. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't! Abby! They're gonna kill us. They're gonna kill my baby. No. Hope, Sharon. Don't lose hope. Let them go. Take me. But let the girls go, man. No! No! No! Abby! Abby! No! Stop, stop, stop, man! Ah! No! Ah! No, please, don't! Please, don't! Don't! Don't! - Abby, no! - No! Sharon! - Stop! - Don't kill my baby! Please, no! - Abby! - No, Sharon! - Sharon! - No! Hey, Abby. You don't give up, okay? Not right now. You have to try. You promised me that you would. We don't deserve this. No one deserves this. No, I know. I know. Oh, fuck. We gotta do something. I can't. Come on, Abby. Let's go back to that beach. You and me. Let's go back to Zuma. I wanna keep having that conversation we were having. You told me that you couldn't remember what we talked about. But I remember. I remember with all my heart. About living in France, how you loved working with those kids. And Marlowe. We bonded over Christopher Marlowe. I didn't know what you were talking about. But it didn't matter. I knew it. What do you say? You and me. Let's go to Zuma. What are you gonna do? Not give up. No! Go! Run! Go, go! Go! Wojciech, come on! Abby. No! No! Go! Go! No! Wait! Stop! No! Up, down, and all around. The most requested song of this hour... It's 10 minutes before 3:00. 70 degrees. Please! Please, help me! We'll be playing the songs you wanna hear, all night long. Please. Please. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do this. Please, don't do this. I'm already dead. Friday night in Los Angeles, a movie actress and four of her friends were murdered. And the circumstances were lurid. The crime scene resembled a strange, religious ritual. A maid discovered the bodies in the morning, and went screaming for neighbors. A wandering band of members of a so-called religious cult, with a leader they call Jesus, has had three of its followers arrested. Uh, we drove to the house with instructions to kill everyone in the house. I felt absolutely nothing for her as she begged for her life. One of the people said, "Who are you?" And Tex said, "I'm the devil, and I'm here to do the devil's business." Believe me. If I started murdering people, there'd be none of you left. Because my children are coming.
