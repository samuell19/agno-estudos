Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. "One Missed Call 2" Goodbye, Miss Kyoko. Goodbye, Miss Madoka. Good bye, kids. Take care. See you tomorrow. How about a drink tonight? I've got so much reading to do... You study too hard. Let your hair down sometimes. It's settled. When it rains the souls of the dead pour down to Earth. Who told you that, Rika? Sorry, I'm late. You must be her mother. Time to go, then. Off you go. Goodbye, Miss Kyoko. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. Here's your fried rice. Sorry for the wait... Mei-feng, your phone's ringing! Who is it? Her boyfriend, who else? Goddamn it. What's wrong? He hates her boyfriend. Poor girl with a Dad like that. Welcome... Kyoko... Not studying? I dragged her out. You guys hardly see each other. Are you grateful? Nosey cow. What'll you drink? Don't blush. Only romantics buy gifts like this. Shut up... That's lovely. A beautiful necklace, said to guarantee eternal love between giver and recipient. I said it was a secret. Sorry. You no call. Leave my daughter alone. Mr. Wang, don't be like that. Dad, where are you? Mei-feng? Where you now? Why you call own cell? I told you it's dangerous to leave oil on the gas... What's the matter? That was Mei-feng, she... Mei-feng... What's wrong? Seen a ghost? We'd run out of black beans. You okay? What that call? What call? There it is! Keep your hands off my phone. One Missed Call Child therapy? So you're quitting day care? Not at all. The course will help me look after the children. Some of our kids are in a bad way. Abused and stuff... Where's your Dad? In back, I guess. No need to make her wait. You're done for today. I'll just be a minute. You got a new one? New number, too. I'll send it. One Missed Call Great, thanks. Send it to me, too. Mr. Wang... About tomorrow's prep... Mr. Wang? Are you there? What's this? I didn't download this ring-tone. Maybe by mistake... One Missed Call Haven't you heard that tune before? I remember... about a year ago... that thing with the spooky cell phones. When that girl died on TV? How did that all end up? Hey, what are you doing? Oh, it's you. What's up? Was there a red candy in his mouth? Still working that old case? What about the candy? Nothing there. What about his phone? I want the call log. No phone, either. None? He didn't own a cell phone. I see. If the brass finds you're here you'll get the chop. Sorry to bother you. Was there a candy in his mouth? No candy. He never owned a cell. Are you sure? One witness heard the killer ring-tone. Why are you obsessed with this case? It's my job. I said it before; this case defies easy answers. Is Yumi Nakamura still missing? There's a reason for everything. Nothing in this world is inexplicable. This is beyond rational explanation. You've not smoked for over a year. I regret it every day. Like being trapped in an endless maze. You and me, both. Kyoko? The police are done with me. You okay? What is it? Can I ask you a few questions? Journalist - Takako Nozoe A call forewarning death? You hear the sound of your own death. I remember that story. People die at random from the call log, right? It's not a story. I guess Mr. Wang took the call and died instead. You really believe this? Last April, a schoolgirl drowned... 3 days later, her friend died. Then a boy she met through friends, ...then Natsumi Konishi. You don't remember? She died on live TV... I was abroad working. Doing what? This job's part-time. I'm a photographer's assistant. You're saying they were killed by some kind of ghost? Mimiko Mizunuma. Died two years ago. Anything strange happen recently? Not really... What? It's probably nothing but... Mr. Wang took a weird call meant for his daughter... Was this the ring-tone? I think it was. I also heard it... Where? On my friend Madoka's cell. Can you call her? Sure. How's Mei-feng? A sedative finally got her to sleep. I made some soup since she'd had nothing all day. She didn't eat it. Poor thing. How about you? Need help? Need help? I'm fine. Naoto will be back soon. Okay, I won't come round, then. Hey, Madoka... Is someone with you? No, I'm alone. Something moved behind you. Don't try and scare me! Get out of there now! What for? Behind you, there's... What, Kyoko? Madoka... Kyoko, what's wrong? One New Message 18:01, July 17th - Madoka First message, sent 18:01, July 17th... Madoka? Madoka, are you home? Kyoko, are you okay? Naoto... There... It's that same ring... Kyoko Okudera No way... Take a look at this. When was it sent? 21:10, July 20th That's in 3 days. A call from the future... like those serial murders... It's still going on. Can I keep this phone? Find out where this was filmed. We should file a report and wait for orders. There's no time. Just do it. How do we put tabs on a ghost? There's nothing the police can do. Pardon me. You can help her, right? We'll do all we can. That's it? July 18th May we ask you about your granddaughter, Mimiko? She's no granddaughter to me. Born after her mother's rape by a lunatic intruder. Was he caught? Unlucky bastard. My husband caught him red-handed. And stabbed him to death. Where's your husband now? After leaving jail, he went back home. Although he vowed never to go back. Never to go back there again. Never go back? Is he Chinese? Taiwanese. You speak Mandarin. A little. What's his name? Wei Zhang. How can I contact him? I doubt he'll talk to you. Jail messed with his head. In what way? He says he can see her. Some girl who's out to kill him. Excuse me... What was Mimiko like? A creepy little thing. Even her mother regretted having her. But she'd done nothing wrong. Stop! Incoming Call Hello? Yuting? Takako... How have you been? Good to hear you. All well? I need your help. I'm looking for a guy in Taiwan, Wei Zhang. I have an old address in Taipei. Okay, I'll get on it. What's the article? Cell phone calls that predict death. You get a call from your own cell then you end up dead? How do you know about it? Is it happening there in Taiwan, too? Here's the forensic report on that girl, Madoka. Was there a candy? No, but traces of coal dust in the stomach lining. Coal? Yes. Mimiko's victims always had a red candy. They found the same coal dust in the stomach of the restaurant owner. Analysis says it's not from Japan. Check to see if it's from Taiwan. Why Taiwan? They've had the same murders there, too. What? Long before Mimiko died. July 19th "Taipei City - TAIWAN" Excuse me, I'm looking for Mr. Wei Zhang... No idea. Thank you. Wei Zhang Mr. Zhang? Is anyone home? It's been two years. You still wear the ring? We're separated, not divorced, right? Did you find your guy? Yes, but didn't get to talk to him. I was the first to find his body. I just got done with the cops. Are you okay? How about you? You look tired. I've been quite busy. What have you been working on? Killer Cell Phone: Links & Observations. Is this a list of the victims? Did you compile it? Yuting? Don't get involved. What do you mean? Hello? It's Naoto. Did you meet Mimiko's grandfather? Already dead... after getting the call. Maybe Mimiko was the next victim from his cell phone's memory. Mimiko's autopsy report. What about it? As you said... coal dust in the stomach. I see... Mr. Wang and Madoka had coal dust not candy inside them. Kyoko's caller ...might not be Mimiko. Police analysis places the coal mine in Mimiko's grandfather's hometown. What's wrong? Incoming Call - Kyoko Okudera How come? Please stop! Still hearing it? It's nothing. You can't let this go because of your sister, right? Rock, paper, scissors... Rock, paper, scissors... Try it again... Rock, paper, scissors... Pick it up. I don't want to. Go on. Stop it! It'll be fine. My sister never came home. Then... I heard her voice that night. "Stop, that hurts" she said. Then I was hit by a wave of agonizing pain. The moment she died. She didn't just drown. She was murdered by whoever was on that phone. Stop blaming yourself, Takako. Even if it's true, it has nothing to do with this. Forget the coal mine, go back to Japan. Kyoko Okudera might die tomorrow. That's too bad, but once you get the call there's no escaping your fate. It's unlike you to say that. I didn't make that list. A journalist friend of mine did. Let me meet him. He died 3 days ago. After getting the call... What's up? It's me. Who else can it be? You must be kidding. Some guys are like that. No idea where they stand. She's so useless. Too dumb to get it. Hey, where are you? Some other kids will be there... He's such a jerk... What's the point of it all? You're joking! Shut up or they'll sew your mouth up, too. Never? It's a really famous urban legend. A girl appears at your bed at 2:22am. At first glance, she's got no mouth. Then you look close and there is one Hard to see because it's all sewn up. Then she mumbles, "Play with me." If you refuse or don't answer she stitches up your mouth. What should I answer? What? What do I say to her? It's just an stupid story. A story... Pardon me. I don't know what to do. Do you remember this place? I found your cell phone over there. I picked it up, then you called to tell me to give it back. If I hadn't picked it up maybe this wouldn't be happening. It's not your fault, Naoto. If you hadn't picked it up we'd never have met. Kyoko. Naoto, I'm going to Taiwan. Kyoko? There's nothing I can do here. If I find that coal mine maybe I'll find a way to save myself. Let me go. I'll go for you. I don't want you to be in danger. Same for me. Okay. Let's go together. I'll make sure you're okay. You have my word. July 20th I rented a car. Thank you. Are you okay? There's still some time left. You're tough. Thanks to Naoto. Before we go to the mine let me show you something. Where? Until about 100 years ago there was a wealthy mining village. But the villagers mysteriously died off and now it's a ghost town. The only survivor lives near here. Are you Shu-mei Gao? I'm Nozoe, from Japan. Do you speak Japanese, Ms. Gao? Ms. Ghao? What's worry? I have something to ask you. Ms. Gao, you're from the mining village? Tell me what happened there. Why did all the people die? You're the only one who knows. Please. She's nuts. Did it to herself when She was a kid. Did that herself when She was a kid. Dear Lord, protect me. Li Li's coming to kill me. Li Li's coming. She's coming to kill me. Who's Li Li? Pull yourself together... Please calm down. Li Li's a monster. Killed everyone with her curse. I was only six then... She was a creepy girl. Always mumbling to herself. Like she was talking to an invisible person. You'll die in 3 days. Just as she said... he died vomiting blood. Not only him. Everyone she told, all the villagers died agonizing deaths... My brother, my friends, my neighbors, everyone... All killed by her curse. The relatives became enraged They dragged her to the coal mine. Once there... they sewed her mouth shut so she'd never foretell another death. They shut her in and sealed the pit forever. We'll go on alone. You didn't get the call, you shouldn't be involved. I'm not here just for you. The cop told us about your sister. It was an accident, right? If there's no connection to this, why bother? Because I wished her dead. Why? Although twins, she alone was safe from Dad's hands. I hated her for that. Please don't blame yourself. I feel like she's calling me. Hello? Where are you? You didn't go back to Japan? I'm going into the mine. I told you not to get involved! What's wrong? It's incredibly dangerous. Don't tell me you got the call? Am I right? Why didn't you tell me? Because... I didn't want you involved. When is your time? Shouldn't you go back? His time is an hour earlier than mine. There's nothing I can do, so... I guess we walk from here. Let's find the entrance. Why was Li Li born with such power? Maybe she didn't have it at birth. There was water-borne plague in these parts. The symptoms would be just like she described. What's that to Li Li? Maybe her gift was to know when someone had the disease... until they cruelly killed her. It's completely blocked. There must be other entrance. Let's split. Don't go by yourself. There's no time, let's go. Stop it! Hello? It's Motomiya. Hello, detective. You scared me. It was that ring-tone. Yumi Nakamura's dead. She wasn't possessed by Mimiko... she went to her of her own accord. It was the evil within herself... ...that was reawakened... I can't hear you. Say it again. It's nearly time... No! I'm sorry. When you died, I shared your pain. Right, Mariko? You felt my pain, too? Forgive me. Mariko! Yuting. Miss Nozoe? Wait here. Naoto... Miss Nozoe? Answer the phone, Yuting. Incoming Call - Yuting Chen Is anyone there? Help! Miss Nozoe? Please! Help me! Don't! Miss Nozoe? Help... Help... Miss Nozoe? Are you okay? Madoka? Don't, please. Help me, please. Kyoko? Kyoko, answer me! Kyoko, get up! Quick! Are you okay? Naoto... Is this the place? They hurt you, so... They were so cruel. Play with me. Yuting! Two more minutes... Where are you? Get out! Get out! Calm down, it's me! Takako? You're okay? The deadline has passed... Thank God. I was scared... of you loving me too much. On the way here I prayed that you'd be safe... that we'd get a second chance. Maybe my sister saved us. I should go. Go help Kyoko. Kyoko, answer me! Play with me. Naoto... That's enough! I understand your pain. Please don't hurt him! Run away. I'll stay with her. Don't be stupid. It's no coincidence I was chosen. I may be able to help her. I'll always be glad we met. No, Kyoko... Go. Please, get out alive. Darling, please go... For my sake... You mustn't give up! I beg you. Try to survive. Hurry! Quickly! Where are we? A transmitter? Two more minutes. Quick, climb up. Let her go! Incoming call - Kyoko Okudera I guess he took the call and died instead. Naoto, don't! You mustn't! Leave it alone! No! Naoto, don't! Please stop. I beg you, stop! Naoto, I know... we'll meet again, right? For sure we'll meet again. You should try to sleep. Don't blame yourself. It's the way he wanted it. But... I'll go call detective Motomiya. One Missed Call Setagaya Precinct, here. Detective Motomiya is dead. They had discovered Yumi Nakamura's body. He crashed on the way to see it, last night. One thing bothers me... He told the paramedics, "It's Mimiko. Mimiko's here." Last night? Who did I talk to earlier? It was the evil within herself that was reawakened. Miss Nozoe? Sorry to come so late. I'm Lin of Taipei Police. This is Detective Huang. May we ask a few questions? Yes. The bodies found in the mine, were they both friends of yours? Both? Are you home, Yuting? I can only pray... this video somehow puts an end to the killings. Where are you? What's going on here? I couldn't have killed him. One Missed Call - Takako Nozoe That's my number... That was when...
