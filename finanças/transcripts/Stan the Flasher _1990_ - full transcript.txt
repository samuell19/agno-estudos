To be or not to be. That is the question Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them To die to sleep, no more and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd To die, to sleep To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil Must... Must give us pause Sir, I'm in sixth grade You are confusing me with my sister Natacha who's a senior Your father already owes me three lessons Seven lessons if we included Natacha’s.

All bitches They want my dick and I can’t perform anymore It’s not true It’s just with Aurore that I can’t get a boner I got a limp, I fucked her too much I’m sick of it But you mustn’t repeat that, I began to talk nonsense Do you get it, fleabag? You are here? Sorry, I’m a little early, my philosophy teacher was sick What the fuck are you doing in my room? You like this, don’t you? You’ll have to wait, you’re too young Let me have a look to your marks In Latin and Greek, your results aren’t very good In philo, your grades are fair. What’s the topic? Pascal This guy was always thinking In math: zero! Well, it's not my field In English: eleven out of twenty. That’s good, you’re making progress Thanks to whom? Thanks to me You know, I didn’t tell you about it. I’m writing a « scenar » What is a « scenar »? I mean a scenario What is a scenario? It’s like a novel But with a scenario... ...you can make a movie What is it about? A guy who « flashes ». A photographer? Would you like to be an actress? Are we still studying Shakespeare today? Yeah, Shakespeare... Fusilli a l'arrabiata Don’t you want to eat? Don’t worry, I eat on my own time Hour difference Aurore difference Horror difference Cynicism only affects cynics It’s a boomerang effect Personally, I don’t care It’s like knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing I know. That's how you got me I don’t agree. I got you thanks to my dick Are you sure? Eat it! That’s good. A spoonful for Jojo Come on, eat! One for Rosalie One for Natacha Are you attracted to her? You’re not in the same category: you’re a heavyweight Mucho jamon por dos huevos: lots of ham for two balls I don’t know your games The more I think, the less I understand. I’m just doing my toenails I see, but I don’t see why You say « why » but in your mind it’s « for whom », isn’t it? Yesterday when you went out you had a spun sock on your left leg And when you went back, it was on your right leg You’re implying I’m turning tricks. Regarding our financial situation, it could be a good idea I could stop teaching to these little assholes and these little girls Swinging between Miller and Baudelaire 50 francs for a blowjob 200 francs for a handjob 2000 francs for an irregular relationship and 10.000 to have it all. What do you mean by « having it all »? That’s what we had three years ago. Four. What do you mean? Four years What a memory! I hope you destroyed the super-8 movies You're kidding, I kept them all. Archival and historic documents! We call this nostalgia, comrade Did you hide my gun? No I didn’t, it’s still here Where? Intellectuals should never play with guns. Don’t worry my dear Only womenfolks can chose to make an overdose of sleeping pills. Keeping their phone… close to her, to be certain to survive Hello darling, quickly call the doctor, I messed up For heaven’s sake, don’t let me die And after the stomach wash, here we go! I love the smell of acetone It reminds me the smell in the hospitals. Fine, I’ve heard that story before. To be or not to be. That is the question Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them Do you know what follows? Translation! To be or not to be, that is the question. Perfect Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them To die to sleep, no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to T’is a consummation devoutly to be wish'd To die, to sleep, perchance to dream—ay there's the rub For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil Must give us pause There’s the respect that makes calamity of so long life For who would bear the whips and scorns of time The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely. Well done The pangs of dispriz’d love he law’s delay, the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes When he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin? It’s fine, go on who would fardels bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary life But that the dread of something after death The undiscover’d country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will, and makes us rather bear those ills we have, than fly to others that we know not of Very good Thus conscience does make cowards of us all And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought And enterprises of great pith and moment, with this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action Soft you now! The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons be all my sins remember’d It’s very good You’re a senior, didn’t you learn the spelling of « entregent » If you’re waiting diamonds to come to you You might as well die Every night you’re crying pearls of melancholy Crying is useless in front of the jewelry store window No need to cry these ornaments are priceless Nothing beats to have a man At least to get over one’s desire Look behind you, darling Your golden necklace is running away You can only count on you Hurry while you’re still pretty In the eyes of all these old trashes Your youth is priceless. Wait a minute… You lecher I'm gonna tell my dad Tell about it Beat it, I’m sick of you Scumbag, bastard, slut You’re the one touching my daughter’s tits? Who are you? I’m Rosalie’s and Natacha’s father, did you get it? And since I’m a gentleman and Natacha’s still a virgin ‘cause I got her fingered by a doctor, I’m gonna rat you out to the cops I’m a zinc worker, I know about clinking Come on… And you’ll go to the clink for good I’m taking one for the road. We can celebrate, can’t we? Hurry up, I’m sleepy. It’s my homework for tomorrow Where did you stop? «I was rudely shaken… … unfreshed. I then descended to the school-room » I forgot the rest. I read you the rest « Boys are cruel, and delight in cruelty acting under the oppression of their absolute masters All that is evil in them is called forth all that is good is repressed They remember the tricks, all brutish, that were played on them the gibes at their simplicity and they will not allow a new comer to escape from the ordeal Boys at school are taught selfishness cunning and cruelty he who retains a touch of kindliness is their fool » What is it? It’s Mr. Stan’s picture. Where did you get it? I stole it from him. Look at his face: so ugly! You’ve had a crush on him? Are you nuts? I prefer James Dean, I find him fucking hot Well, he’s dead He has something in common with him: he’s a living corpse I don’t like him, he smells like death You’re so harsh I admit he’s getting a little handsy, it’s all in good fun though That’s what he did to you? Stop it! Fuck you, I’m not a dyke (a « stamp gluer ») What do you mean? She’s a girl who loves girls The orchestra was playing a beautiful tango He was holding his love in his arms I took a knife on the table And... my revenge was cruel Yes, it was I was wasted I made a mistake I killed my gigolo my dear friends Like a naughty girl I stuck my knife in his belly Give me some coke to disturb my mind my spirit flies away to the Lord where my sweetheart drove me crazy You know, despite appearences, I am... an intellectual Here’s the proof I know the sorcerers who summon the jets in the jungle of New Guinea They're scanning the zenith greedy for guineas through cargo looting On the Coral sea, as the plane passes, These smart creatures These Papuans hope the clouds will cause… the accident of the Viscount and of the Comet As their totem… never succeeds in shooting down neither a Boeing nor even a DC-4 they’re hoping for a hijacking or a bird accident These naive shipwreckers armed with blowguns do not respect the cargo cult blowing in their sarbacane towards the sky and planes Keep it down, you get on my nerves with your bullshit I got enough on my mind Come on, you’ll be out soon You’ll just stay under custody I took it for life I’ve already served five years Five « musical » years. What do you mean by « musical »? Because of the beans, dickhead With the remission of penalty… if I keep my nose clean, I’m going to stay… another 10 years in this prison world I’ll fill you in and not with Chanel perfume You were just playing doctors and nurses Well, what do you know? You’re not a horndog like I used to be To defend myself here, I have only Five-Fingered Mary After fucking them like a beast I used to take my six-blade knife « made in swissland » I used to take the tallest one I’m not talking about the girl but about the blade And I cut her throat Do you know how I got caught? A damn dog dug up a human tibia in my garden Do you know what the judge told me in court? Why did you put the victims in a chair after cutting their throat? And I foolishly answered « I used to go for a walk after the murder And I just like knowing that someone was waiting for me when I came back » Goldberg, you have a visitor, come quick! you came to see the wild animals Pay attention The Metro Goldwyn Mayer lion Any news about my script? I read a couple of pages but I don’t think they’re gonna pay for it Everybody is fucking everywhere If you came just to throw jokes at me, it wasn’t worth the trip Beat it, I’m sick of you I told your students you were in the hospital. In a psychiatric hospital… You should see the poet they put me with Have you ever heard of Antonin (M)Artaud (= hammer) You changed your lipstick Only Jojo was worried about you And what about Natacha? No news Is that all? I almost forgot, I brought you Shakespeare’s books Othello, Macbeth, The King Lear, Richard III My kingdom for a horse, my dick for a horse kingdom Why didn’t you bring Hamlet? I was already in a deep shit and you put my head in the bowl Othello, Macbeth, The King Lear, you can shove them up your ass You see what I mean, bitch! Goldberg be quiet or I’ll put you in solitary. Shut the fuck up! It’s going to get stormy. And Aurore is getting corny High-class joke! Stop your bullshit, I’m not in the mood I’ll tell you something: I’m starting to get you In what way? When you speak about cutting throats Squeak! Your name is Natacha, isn’t it? Come, come closer. Don’t be afraid, sit down You’re pretty, as fresh as morning dew You didn’t go to jail to see him? You could have at least sent him flowers But do you even know the language of flowers? So, listen to me: Absinthe: absence, bitterness Acacia: elegance, the desire to please Almond tree: sweetness, recklessness Amaryllis: artifice Hawthorn: be careful Camelia: beauty without pretension Lily of the valley: end of sorrows, back to happiness Forget it! Myosotis: forget-me-not Narcissus: selfishness, vanity Water lily: coldness Carnation: whim Orange tree: virginity No one’s touched you yet, I assume Except Stan who brushed you like a flower Orchid: refinement Poppy: sleep, dream, lethargy Pansy: recollection Reseda: tenderness Tuberose: desire, voluptuousness Violet: modesty Convolvulus: the desire to please You’re eager to please, aren’t you? I’d rather think of you as a plant I think of you as a nettle It secretes an acrid liquid containing formic acid And touching it is painful Go away! Aurore? She’s not here Where is this fucking idiot? Whore perfume Fuck! Stan, you really disgut me By the way, your script sucks At least according to the producers and myself... Movies aren’t your thing I found a waitressing job at a shitty bar where I get paid peanuts... I’ll try to make a future for myself by forgetting this miserable past I took the lace tablecloth Mom gave you for your birthday... And also the Chinese porcelain coffee cups and silverware I leave you the crystal glasses for your fucking vodka Goodbye Stan, poor schmuck. So long baby and good luck. Aurore. Bitch! Here is high society Hi Stan. Hi Do you want the last news? The bitch took off. Did she? Is that final? So it’s over You worked hard for it, did you? I hadn't fucked this whore in six months Do you want me to let you into the secret? In my last few attempts, I went floppy inside her What is the life of senses: an alternative movement which goes from appetite to disgust and from disgust to appetite The uncertain soul always floats between renewed ardour and slowing down ardour But in this perpetual movement we never tire of being entertained by the image of a wandering freedom According to Bossuet quoted by Flaubert's defense attorney at Madame Bovary's trial It rocks, it’s awesome It’s a shocker I don't want to hurt your feelings, but vodka is best drunk cold I’m sorry. Since I was in prison and my wife is gone, the fridge had time to defrost Stan the flasher What did you say? A « flasher » which derives from the word « flash » an American word Literal translation: exhibitionist A morbid obsession that causes some people to impulsively flaunt their genitals preferably in front of the little girls naked under a trenchcoat or, if one prefers, a raincoat I've done this a couple of times, I don't know what came over me How do you know that? You're the one who told me one night when we were drunk It's fun, it's fun I won another 3000 fcs in a poker game. Of course, you're cheating This way, it's easy Actually First you have to be skillful and then you must find suckers To be or not to be Question, answer Natacha? Natacunt, natacunt...
