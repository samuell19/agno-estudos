GO WITH PEACE JAMIL Come on. - You have to look after Adam. - What's going on? Just do me that favour. Take him to Yasmina's now, understood? I understand. Okay. Do what aunt Amira tells you. She's taking you to mom's now. - Where are you going? - Dad needs to help a friend. Who is it? No one you know ... Drive, Omar. I beg you, just drive. Yasmina? Hi, Omar. How are you? I want to talk to you. Come. Hi, my little friend. Hi ... - Where's Dad? - He's talking with your mom. I don't understand how ... What is it you don't understand? That you left me? I needed to be alone for a while, Yasmina. We all needed it. But listen ... I'm going away. Going away? Where to? - Down to my mother's family. - Why? - Something happened to them? - No, they're fine. Don't worry. But I need to ask you a favour. If anybody asks, I've been here since this morning. Okay? - Please tell me what's going on. - Don't worry ... I'm not going to jail. I'm leaving tonight. Then you'll follow as soon as possible. Haven't we always talked about leaving this place, huh? Yes, but why tonight, Jamil? Because fate wants it that way. What are you doing, dad? Are you sad? No, my dear. Dad's not sad. I swear, things couldn't be better. Off you go, my friend. Thanks. Jamil! Peace be with you. I can get rid of that knight for you. No, I'll handle that myself. Jamil? What a surprise. How are you doing, my son? - Have a seat. - Would you like some tea? No thanks, dad. What's the matter? Come on, unburden your heart. I swear, ever since he was a boy I never could figure him out. Just like his mother, God bless her soul. You never knew what she was thinking. You always taught me to treat the ones you love - - as if it was your last day together. I remember. Beause you never know when you'll have to part ... ... or lose them. So what's your problem, son? Talk to me. Isn't it something your old man can fix as I've done so many times before? Dad, true happiness ... True happiness is only found in the hereafter. - Isn't that what they say? - Yes. Isn't that so, uncle? Isn't it? If anything happens to me then take care of my son. Look after Adam, dad. Excuse us for a minute ... Come here, son. Come. Come. What's going on? What could happen? I'm your father, talk to me! You know not to ask me something God already demands of me. Is this okay? Thank you. May God have mercy on your soul. Dear brother, what have those bastards done to you? Let go! May God forgive your sins, dear brother - - and forgive your doings - - and look at your good deeds and let you enter Paradise. Oh, God ... I appreciate that you brought him to me. He needs to be buried on time. Today? Yes. Today. - What are you doing? - Nothing, I'm at home. We're waiting for you. Get down here. Come on. you shouldn't be alone. Get me Jamil. Jamil? Are you sure it's him? It can only be him. Goddamned Sunni. Who? Jamil? Who else? Did you think I was talking about you? Enough. Do you hear? Don't worry. We'll get him. Listen. Leave Omar out of it. He'll do anything to protect Jamil. Get Jamil ... alive. Alive, understood? Don't hurt him or his family. Not yet ... What's up, cousin? Where have you been? - I'm here now. - Damn, you look sharp. Hi, my friend. - It's good you came. - How are you, Jamil? Don't worry. We're brothers, man. - We'll not let you you down. - Thanks. A delivery of meat just arrived. You know those Pakis. You have to keep an eye on them. - Okay. - I'll be right back. What are you gonna do now? Jamil, what are you gonna do? The whole town will be looking for you. Yes? Your friend is here. For the sake of God, take it easy. - Fucking Shias. - What the hell are you saying? They hate us, man. Some Shias think they go to Heaven if they kill a Sunni. - That's true. I've heard that too. - What? What do you mean? Don't some Sunnis think they get God's blessing by killing a Shia? You're like a brother to me. You know that. But don't curse the Shias. Did you forget my mother is Shia too? God willing, it'll all work out. God willing ... God bless you. You two break my heart. I almost wanna cry. - Really, I've got tears in my eyes. - So you want a kiss too? Come here. Don't blow that shit in my face. Fucking bedouin. Hey, watch your tongue! We hate each other to the death. More than the Palestinians and Israelis hate each other. Haven't the Sunni and Shia always fought each other? Listen to the righteous imam. You need some pussy. I've got many Sunni friends. There's no difference between us. Take my Egyptian friend here ... If there's no difference and we all agree - - then let's ask the Egyptian : Who should have been the first Caliph? Can you tell me? All I know is that God gave the Koran to us all. Yeah, we're brothers, man! Brothers, huh? In the name of God the merciful ... Don't ever say no to my homemade Hummus. There you are. - Is it good? - Yeah, really good. Of course it is. It's your father's recipe. - What's wrong? - It's probably your hummus. - I'm getting some smokes. - Smoke mine. - I'm not smoking your cheap shit. - Kiss my ass. Sure, honey. - Why do you always do that? - What? Break off the tip of the cigarette? Maybe to be remembered for something. After all, the hummus is your dad's recipe, right? Right. What the hell is Abu Moussa doing? Abu Moussa? Abu Moussa! Did you get your smokes? Hi, there. Jamil ... You have to come with us. Mahmoud wants a few words with you. Come, Jamil. Let's go. Now. Open up. What are you doing here? Stay here. Stay here, Omar. For God's sake, stay here. Please stay ... Jamil! Omar! Omar! Omar! Jamil! Why did you stop? - I think he went in there. - So what are you waiting for? - I'm not going in there. - Then stay here. Keep an eye on the door. How the fuck could you leave me with those Turks? We can't stay here. We just shot a guy. - The bastard's in there, you idiot. - What are you doing here then? I'm not setting foot in their mosque. Let's go. - Where is he? - I don't know. - We'll get him later. - But how ...? Poor Jamil. To hell with Jamil. Protect me against Satan. In the name of the merciful Creator. God, I call upon you in this moment of despair. Only you can protect my soul. I'm trapped in a game - - between men who should be brothers. But instead we feel mortal hate for each other. What shall I do? I'm haunted by death and hell - - and evil won't let go of my soul. Give me peace ... I won't live my life in the dark. Oh, Omar ... God have mercy on your soul. Am I not obliged to avenge him? Will you never bring me peace? Haven't I suffered enough for my mother's death? Forgive me ... And my family ... Please leave them out of this. Dear God, protect my family against my sins. Protect them against me. Husam. Why? Once again the Shias bring us grief. Those animals are gonna pay. We'll fill the streets with their blood, understand? It's not just the Shias, Husam. - It's Abu Moussa who's betrayed us. - No. He's always despised you and me. He always said you'd cause Omar's death. You, Jamil! And isn't that what happened? What are we gonna do? First of all ... ... we need to help Omar's wife ... ... and his daughters. We have to help them in their sorrow. Husam, get a grip on yourself! Listen to me! You take care of that bastard Abu Moussa. Make him pay for his treachery. Okay? It's your responsibility. Promise me you'll make him pay! Promise me! You already washed Omar's blood off your hands? Go ahead, hero. Kill me as well. Unburden your heart. Get it over with. The war sealed our fates. Back then we were too young to understand. But now I realize the truth. It was painful to witness how my brother Bilal changed. He didn't care who he was fighting anymore. He became like a robot ... Like a machine without any emotions. The whole war was a machine, Mahmoud. A machine created by Satan. And we all helped to keep the wheels turning. I don't see how Shias and Sunnis can justify - - the bloodshed they've brought upon each other? All I know is that it's got nothing to do with God. I agree. It's difficult to see God in that war. When God created man he gave us free will. Just like you have a free will. The free will to decide - - whether you want to kill my son. - Hi, dad. - Hello, my son. How are you doing, my boy? - Where are you going? - I'm off to play football. - Do you need anything before I leave? - Yes, say hello to an old friend. Hi, Ali. - Ali will soon be the new Maradona. - Really? They're paying him to play on the team. - You're actually a pro. - I only get money for the bus fare. - It's a start. - The bus fare ... - See you later. - Bye, son. Do you want your son to enter the machine too? Listen here, Mahmoud. You're a fatherjust like me. And I've come to you - - out of love for God and love for my son. You've got the power to end this conflict between us - - and close this cycle. I can't. You can't or you won't? I demand justice. It's my right. You're right. The cycle has to be closed. That's why Jamil has to pay for what he's done. For God's sake, Mahmoud. How do you know the cycle will be closed - - if you get your kind of justice? Do you think you know fate better than God the almighty? Don't you raise your finger in my face! Look at me and listen! Take a good look. The one you want to kill - - is not a small bird. He's my son! My flesh and blood. Do you understand what I'm saying? The justice you seek is nothing but an illusion. A false justice created by Satan. But remember ... ... that God created man ... ... and damned be he who destroys what God has created. Uncle Jamil! Where have you been? We'll go fishing soon. Adam misses you. We'll all go fishing. You have to avenge him. Just like he would have avenged you. Promise me, Jamil. Jamil. Did you take care of that son of a whore? - Not yet. - Not yet? What do you mean not yet? What are you talking about? Come here. What's going on? Things have changed, Husam. I don't know ... What don't you know? Have you lost your mind? Abu Moussa caused Omar's death. Omar took a fucking bullet for you! Abu Moussa is a traitor, and that's worse than your worst enemy! - How could you let him live? - Calm down! - What are you doing here? - I'm here with Aunt Amira. - Why isn't he with his mother? - Yasmina is at work. Does Yasmina know you've brought him here? - No ... I just came to condole. - What? Have you lost your mind? Come here ... - It hurts. - What? - It hurts, dad. - Stop crying. I'm taking him to my father's place. - Then what? - Then we'll meet. Watch your back. What do you think Mahmoud's up to? And Salah, where did he go? How the fuck should I know? All I know is - - that we're sitting here eating ice cream. I'd like to know what you've got in mind. What I've got in mind? - Haven't I made that clear? - Listen, Mahmoud. I don't trust that dirty Egyptian. Those disbelievers always stick together. Relax. I got the Egyptian under control. Let me take care of that son of a bitch, Jamil. By myself, Mahmoud. I've heard that they mix pig's fat in the ice cream at the factory. I want to look Jamil in the eye tonight. And if he doesn't want to come on his own, give him a reason. A reason? - What do you mean? - He's got a son, right? A family never argues in front of other people. Haven't I taught you that? In God's name, the Merciful I seek refuge in the Lord of men, The King of men The God of men From the evil of the whisperings of the slinking Who whisper into the hearts of men From among the demons and men God is great. I bear witness to God being one and Muhammad is his prophet. God's peace and mercy be with you. - Hi, dad. - Hi. Welcome, welcome, Adam ... How are you? Dad's promised that I can watch cartoons. Don't you want to see what granddad got you? - You got something for me? - Of course I do. Something your dad always wanted. - I'll be off, dad. - Hold on. - I have to leave. - I told you to wait. We need to talk. - You're spoiling him. - So what? You'll be doing the same with Adam's children. I don't have children. God willing you'll have lots of children, my boy. Lots of children. Push the button ... It's really fast. Watch out! Again, dad! Again. Are you smashing up the entire apartment? It's not me. It's dad. - Can I try? - Okay. Jamil, come here for a second. Jamil, I told you to come. I'll go talk with granddad. Do as I showed you. Turn on the light. Make yourself comfortable. Are you pleased with your life, Jamil? I asked you something. Are you pleased with your life? Not really. Then why do you do everything to ruin it for yourself and the rest of us? Look at me when I'm talking to you. Your best friend Omar got killed today. And it's all because of you. And now you want revenge. They killed Omar like they killed my mother. Dad, why ...? Why didn't you take revenge? Why didn't you avenge her? They killed your wife! Why didn't you take revenge? You've always known who killed her! You knew him. You even made me shake his hand on the street. So now you raise your voice at your father, huh? Here ... Eat. - What's this? - It's food. What else? Aren't you hungry? Isn't this ...? - Isn't this pork? - Pork? So what? It's still food. Eat. If it's pork I won't touch it. And why is that? It's a sin, dad. A sin ... Pork is a sin. And letting your wife twist her body like a snake every night isn't? And letting the hungry wolves eat her with their eyes isn't a sin? The life you're living and your dirty money isn't a sin? Your son who has no one to raise him, isn't that a sin? Murder and bloodshed - - are not sins either? Jamil. Look at me. Had I avenged your mother - - then who would have taken care of you? Eat! Free me from Satan and his evil ways. God have mercy on my soul. I wish ... ... you'd never seen what you saw, Jamil. I always thought - - that you'd forget with time. Jamil ... You need to cleanse your heart of hatred. You need to live in peace with your enemies. In peace? How can I live in peace with those who stained me with my mother's blood? How? You have to understand one thing, son. It wasn't the Shias who took your mother away from you. Shias, Sunnis, Jews, Christians were all possessed by hatred. Even though we all worship the same God. You're right, dad. - But ... - No buts, Jamil. You're letting the same hatred - - take control of your life. Everything you do in this life is your own responsibility. Responsibility to yourself and toward God. You need to think about your son's future. Adam ... Did you forget what Adam signifies? Man. You need to look after your son - - as if you were looking after all of mankind. Right, son? Can I watch cartoons now? - Aren't you tired? - No. Alright. But you'll have to go to bed soon, okay? - Off you go. - My little mankind ... You need to look after yourself as well. Right? Give granddad a kiss. Off you go. Jamil. You already got your revenge. If you want to do something for Omar - - then take care of his kids. I'll have to leave the country. And Adam and his mother? They're coming with me. God help me convince Yasmina. It's important you understand - - that you probably won't be able to return. - Do you hear? - I have to get Yasmina now. Go directly to get your wife. No detours. The people you think are your friends - - they are your real enemies. All they think about is revenge. They couldn't care less about you. You need to focus on your wife and son now. And that guy Husam ... don't waste your life on him - - just because he's got a few drops of your mother's blood in his veins. Okay. Dad's leaving for a bit. - Okay. - I'll be back soon. Don't go, dad. - I just need take care of something. - You're always leaving me. I'll never leave you. You're my mankind. I have to look after you, right? Jamil! What the hell's going on? Come over here! Get in. Let's get going. I'm not coming. I'm fucking tired of your shit, Jamil. Don't be stupid. Come with us. Listen. I'm not going. I have to pick up Yasmina. Then let's get her together. I'm not going anywhere with you guys. I'm getting my wife alone. Period. Jamil, if they see you you're finished. Use your head. Do you want your cousin to clean up your mess? Let's finish this. Fucking faggot. Jamil. We have to stick together now. For Omar. For Omar's sake. Come on, Jamil. No, granddad. Don't turn it off. It's late. You're tired. No, I'm not. So you're not tired? By God, you're as stubborn as your father. Let me wrap this around you so you won't get cold. Okay? We've got to stick together like family. Right, cousin? I swear, you're a hero, Jamil. Yeah, baby. Now we're flying. You showed the way by killing the pig who killed your mother. - There are the cunts! - Let's show those faggots. Come on, get the guns out! - Come on! - The bitch won't open. - Fuck it, let's get out of here. - Come on, for fuck's sake! Get out, Jamil! Enough! Let him go. - Let him go. - Shoot him! Come on! Shoot him for fuck's sake! What are you doing? - Drive. - What the fuck are you saying? Come on, drive. Drive, I said! - What the hell are you doing? - What ...? Are you insane? - Fucking faggot. - Stay away from me. Stay the fuck away from me. Understand? Eesa, come here. You too, Husam. Stay away from me. Get it? Jamil! Where are you going? Get in. Get the fuck in. You and your cousin ... Son of a bitch! I'll never forget this. Never, Husam! Who do you think we are? If you two can't work it out together, then we'll have to. I'll fuck your sister, you faggot. Nice dancing. You're a murderer. I have no control over my life. My past is eating me up from within. It's eating me up! The past ... ... is tearing me apart. I don't know what to do. I feel the fire of hell under me. You're my soul ... ... and my whole life. You always have been. I know I've let you down. But a life without you has no meaning. Yasmina, I beg you. Come to Lebanon with me. You and Adam. Let's live the life we've always dreamed of. We can't come with you, Jamil. You'll never change. You're the only one dreaming now. Don't say that. I promise you ... I can't. Forgive me for everything, Yasmina. - Summon the army and await orders. - Yes, my lord! Adam? Yeah? - Would you like some juice? - Yes, please. I bear witness that God is one ... Granddad? Wake up, granddad. Please wake up, granddad. Wake up. Wake up ... Please wake up. Adam? Adam? Is everything okay? - Yeah, everything's fine. - You sure? - Just go home. - Bye. You want any? Suit your fucking self. It's a sin to swear. You're right, it's a sin. When is my dad coming? I know my granddad isn't sleeping. - Yes, he's sleeping. - Why are you lying? I want my dad. - Hallo? - Have you got the boy? Yeah, he's here. I'll be there soon. I'm just waiting for the other two. - Should I call Jamil? - No, he shouldn't know yet. - Wait until I get there. - Alright. You want to go for an ice cream while we wait for daddy? - I need to pee. - Alright, this way. Don't forget to wash your hands. Mahmoud! What's going on, Jamil? What do you want? Leave us alone! - Where's my son? - Take it easy, Jamil. - For God's sake no! - Where's my son? No, leave him alone! Jamil, please stop. For God's sake. Where is he? Dad! Please stop. Leave my father alone. No! Please don't. Isn't that Mahmoud's wife? What's she doing out without her headscarf? - He's taken Mahmoud! - Who? Jamil, get him. - Fuck! - For God's sake, hurry! Listen, Jamil. Jamil ... I know what pain my brother has caused you. I know what you're going through. The same fire has burnt us all. Thanks to your father it's still burning in you. If he'd had the guts to avenge your mother ... ... and not been such a coward ... ... and left it up to you ... ... things wouldn't have come this far. You on the other hand are a good example to your boy. But thank your father, Jamil, for never getting to see your son again. No. No! Mahmoud! Mahmoud! What's happened? What happened to your eye? What the hell's happened to your eye? What have you done? Have you lost your mind? What have you done to Mahmoud? What were you thinking? Fucking dog! Stop, that's enough! Help Mahmoud. My eye! Enough! The knife. Give me the knife. The knife! Mahmoud ... Slit his throat. Mahmoud. Slit his throat! Bring an end to it! - Mahmoud! - No! It ends here. Go get your son. He's with Salah at the club. Help him! Help him! Help him yourself. Do you know ''Adam'' means man? I'd forgotten. You're a clever kid. - Your dad must be very proud of you. - He is. - I've been here before with my dad. - Really? - Don't you want to sleep? - We can't. Then my dad won't find us. We're not going anywhere. We're staying right here. Come here. There's the pig! ''Who so ever kills a human being it shall be as if he killed all mankind.'' The Koran, 5:32
