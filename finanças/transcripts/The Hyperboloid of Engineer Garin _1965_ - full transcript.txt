CHEKMARYOV Gaston - V. SHPRINGFELD Captain Yansen - B. OYA Vanya Gusev - Alyosha USHAKOV How are you doing, Comrade Tarashkin? Everything's all right? Everything's all right. I've come to get a bit oftraining. Well, are you signing up for our eight-boat team? Not sure. I'm afraid I won't be able to be punctual. - We're in for a funny business. - Something about the bandits again? Think bigger. Crime on an international scale. Too bad. We could row together. Do you know well the people living in these dachas? They're mostly tramps. Why? Has someone moved into one ofthe dachas recently? There is a closed-up dacha in this little forest. A week ago l saw smoke coming from it. We thought, maybe bandits or homeless. Did you see them? Wait, Comrade Shelga. - You're right, someone was here. - Just as I said! But ifthey live here... why the hell do they get in through the window? Shall we take a look? They seem to be twins. As alike as two oars. I smelled a rat right away. Quiet! Hey, man, you got a window open! You might get robbed! Hey, anybody here? There he is! That's him, the twin. Right. They've done a hell ofwork on him! Why, I saw him just this morning. Tarashkin, come here. Look what he was doing here. A real laboratory. What was the steel cut with? Did the murderer want to know it? The four-fingered. No, P.P. Garin wasn't into pyrotechnics here. Vasily Vitalyevich, what's this? - Where did you find it? - There's a whole box ofthem there. Very mysterious pyramids. Get down! Damn it, I really got scared. I thought it was dynamite. I don't advise you to do such experiments again. This pyramid could be a gas spark plug. In that case we wouldn't see each other for a long time. Well... let's try to establish facts. First, the reason for the murder wasn't either revenge or robbery. Second, the victim's name is P.P. Garin. - Right. - That's about all for now. You want to say that P.P. Garin is the one who left in the boat? - Yes. - I don't think so. Who, then? Garin himselfwrote the name on the board. Psychologically, it's clear. If I were to invent such a wonderful thing' delighted, I would have written my own name, not yours. Absolutely true, your own. ''The mission is accomplished only by half. The engineer has left. Couldn't get the documents. Waiting for instructions.'' What's the matter? Accept a telegram. The telegram is about some scientific work. No receipt needed. He got away' Comrade Shelga. - Why did you let him get away? - A car was waiting for him. What about your motorcycle? He slashed the tire with a knife. I whistled' he got in the car and left. Did you get his license number? The number was deliberately covered with dirt. Show me the telegrams. To Lenoir' Rue de Chemin Vert' 63. Pyramid experiments progressing successfully. Try to obtain full combustion. P.P. I read about Garin's murder in yesterday's evening paper. We once worked together in Professor Mantsev's laboratory. What kind of man was Garin? Garin? What can I tell you... One is not supposed to speak badly about the deceased. And still? Garin... An adventurer ofthe highest class. You could expect anything from him. He enticed Professor Mantsev into some expedition' and for a year now we haven't heard anything of Mantsev. Apparently' there's been some disaster. Professor' it's become known to us that some people abroad got interested in Garin. We don't know for sure yet who murdered Garin. But as for where the tracks lead... - Well? - Look. ''The chemical king Rolling arrived in Europe. His visit is connected to a mysterious apparatus ofthe Russian engineer Garin.'' Yes' for Rolling it's only a tremendously powerful weapon. Have you seen Garin's apparatus? No. I doubt that anybody's seen it. A small-sized steel strip' cut through no one knows how' that I have seen. Why' that's Mantsev! Professor Mantsev made a very important discovery - a beam that burns everything from a distance. And by some way' Garin made use of Mantsev's apparatus. Can you show me that steel strip? Yes' I can. You'll get it tomorrow. The rowing club's man on duty speaking. Was it you who called? - Where? - To the 16th. Yes' we did. It was me, Tarashkin, who called. I saw one ofthe twins. Comrade Shelga was asking about them. Listen! Garin! I'm listening. - Open the hatch! - You want to arrest me? We got plenty oftime for it. Follow me! Hurry! Tarashkin! What's the wind? Comrade Shelga? I already began to worry. Southwester. - All the yachts in place? - I guess so. The ''Orion'' is in Peterhof, and two boats were taken to Strelna. A sheet in your throat! The ''Bibigonda'' got stolen while I was on the phone! Our best racing boat! Petka' may you drown 30 times in the rotten water! Why didn't you watch?! I did watch' honest! Call the motorboat! Gotcha! Hurting the little ones? You better never do it again! Get out of here! I'll show you! You! Where do you live? - Nowhere. - So you're homeless. Are you hungry? - Yes. - Then let's go to our club! Here' eat. What's your name? Ivan. Where're you from? From Siberia' the Amur river. What are you looking for? Krestovsky Island. What do you want on the island? A dacha' and which one is none ofyour business. - How about washing up? - I can't wash. I think he needs a good bath. I can't wash. I can only up to here. - Are you afraid ofwater? - No' I'm not. He's afraid to take off his vest' for fear someone would steal it. Don't wash ifyou don't want to' but we can't allow a dirty vest. No' we can't. Give him a uniform. A sailor's uniform? To such a dirty boy? We'll think of something. Where're you going? It wasn't our deal. Come on' take it off. Take it off! Show me your back. I can see anyway what's written on your back. Wait! Stop biting' you silly! Tell him not to read! They're going to kill me for that! This is for Garin. The results most encouraging. Assume depth of olivine at 5 kilometers. Continuing prospecting. Need help. Starving. Hurry with expedition. Coordinates - longitude 150 East' latitude 67 North. Will hand over formulas only at meeting. M. Mantsev. So Garin is alive' hiding abroad' and you're following in his tracks? And bringing a surprise to him. This is only part ofthe message. The boy also has the coordinates of Mantsev's winter stay. Probably' the place close to the bedding of olivine. - Is that what Mantsev's looking for? - Yes. The olivine belt. Get ready. The landing is in 15 minutes. The olivine belt. What's that? Well' how shall I explain it... The olivine rocks in melted form - mercury' gold' at a depth of 12 kilometers. - Incredible! - So far it's only a hypothesis. But ifwe assume that a heat beam can bore the earth' then... Ah! Making his way to gold - that is Garin's aim. But without Mantsev' he's not likely to do it. Yes' to find Garin is a difficult task. I'll find Garin and bring him back' along with the apparatus. You know what... I'm going on a scientific trip. But ifyou need me... Here's my address. Well? The drawings? I've done everything. I'm asking: where're Garin's drawings? I don't see them. Mister Rolling' we agreed that I'd deliver not only the drawings' but the apparatus' too. I've done a lot ofwork. I've found the right people. They got to Leningrad' penetrated into Garin's laboratory and saw the apparatus in action' but... Something happened there. First' there were two Garins. We managed to remove one. You mean you killed him? Well' something like that. But you don't have to worry' he's a subject ofthe Soviets... Bullshit. I'm amazed at your audacity' Arthur. Showing up here empty-handed! I need the apparatus. And the drawings. Mister Rolling' and I need money. About... ...twenty thousand. Will you give me a cheque or cash? Engineer Garin... is in town. - You're lying. - Why should I lie? Yesterday my agent bumped into Garin nose to nose on the boulevard. My agent is here' he can corroborate my words. I don't wish to see your agent. But you must understand that ifyou commit a crime I won't be rescuing you from the guillotine. But ifyou try to cheat on me' I will destroy you. I won't give you 20 thousand' five will be quite enough for you. But on one condition. I should be informed of Garin's every step. Arthur! Garin has just left. But I shall find him today. Allow me to introduce... We'll meet in half an hour at the ''Siren'' cafe. Go! What grounds do you have to maintain that it's Garin? You already made a mistake in Leningrad. You don't mean to say that Garin has doubles in every city? He knows Garin only too well. This is Garin's handshake. Excuse me' Madame. I wanted to live up to your trust. I haven't slept days and nights. I sacrificed my life for the idea' Mister Rolling. I have my own account to settle with Garin. As if it was written with a needle in soft dough. He claims that Garin built an apparatus that can easily cut a dreadnought' like butter. But now it's important to clear up something else. Are you giving us a free hand to do this on our own and one fine morning bring you the apparatus and the drawings? By no means. Mister Rolling would like to acquire the right of ownership for this invention. If Mister Rolling believed a single word ofyours about the murder' about all those... incredible adventures' he would've called the police commissar right away. All he wants from you is a good detective work' that's all. Of course' he'll pay generously for it. Your task is to give me a precise and detailed information about Garin. And don't make a move' or say a word without my authorization. I've received your telegram. Here're the results. Pyotr Petrovich' you and me' we've gone through so much together. You had plenty of opportunity to see that I'm an honest man. Tell me' why the hell are you hiding the apparatus from me? I know that without me' without my pyramids you're helpless. - Let's do it in a comradely way. - Fine. I hope there's no soot' the combustion is full? That's what I need. You want me to reveal to you the secret? - Yes. - All right. Only on one condition. Any condition. I change hotels every night... not to arouse any suspicions. Today I noticed that I was being followed. I need to cover up my tracks. What do I have to do? I need a double. Yes' but... I haven't finished the experiments yet. Look' Lenoir' soon you and me will get billions! You'll have your own institute. You and me... You heard of Rolling? The chemical king? Exactly. l've talked to him. He'll be our partner. Lenoir! ls it a deal? - l've always believed in your genius. - And you were right. Rue de Chemin Vert' 63. 5'000 to Arthur. Garin' Garin... Monsieur Lenoir. Please. Garin' whose interests l'm representing' would like to know ifyou realize what his apparatus is intended for? Yes' the apparatus might be of interest for some industrial applications. The apparatus is not designed for industrial purposes. This apparatus is for destruction. Now it is the most powerful weapon in the world. The apparatus has been constructed' it can be demonstrated. Garin offers you his cooperation. Monsieur Lenoir. Tell me' who is a madman - you or him? All right' you may tell Garin that l'm ready to offer him 50 thousand for the patent of his invention. Your offer should be interpreted this way. You intend to get possession ofthe apparatus and do away with Garin the way you did with his assistant on Krestovsky lsland? Assuming that is exactly what l'm going to do with Garin' what's the conclusion then? The conclusion is that Garin has apparently made a mistake. What mistake? Taking you for a scoundrel of a much greater scale. You're right. lt's stupid to share the profits with Garin if I can have all 100 percent. All right' to put an end to it... 100 thousand' and not a centime more. Bravo' Mister Rolling' you just amaze me! Your agents have followed Garin to his residence. Report on him to the police' and he'll be arrested. The same agents will steal the drawings and the apparatus. lt will cost you only 5'000. Easy and cheap. Why 100 thousand? This is a cheap gamble! Yes' you're just a two-bit charlatan. Garin got a checkmate' he knows it' and he sent you to bargain? I won't even give a farthing for his patent. He's been tracked down' he's in a trap. And go to hell! All right' I agree to all your proposals. Not a farthing! Go' or you'll be thrown out! And no tricks! Out! Take this character out! What a cheek! Gaston' if it works out' you'll provide for yourselffor life. I won't do a hitjob for any money. Times are different now. To do it for you would be another matter. For you I would've risked my own neck. I think we could talk business with you. All right' everything will be done as you wish. The address? Rue de Chemin Vert' 63. So long' Gaston. Rolling's waiting for me. Rolling's agreed to everything. When the exploitation begins' he'll get 50 percent' we the other 50. - Have you signed the contract? - We'll sign it in 2 or 3 days. Yes' Lenoir' dear... Do you remember Nikolai Khristoforovich Mantsev? What does Mantsev have to do with it? - He's on Kamchatka. - What's he looking for there? Mantsev must confirm my theoretical findings about the melted rocks ofthe olivine belt sitting closer to the earth surface along the edges ofthe Pacific. I don't understand what you need that olivine belt for? To own the world' my dear. l'll have the whole world right here... Let's drink to our success. Zoya' the one looking at you all the time is Garin! Kissing your hands' Arthur. What did he write to you? l'll tell you later. Something about that character who's so brazenly staring at you? He's the one who visited me. I turned him out. Rolling' it's Garin. Nonsense' it's engineer Lenoir' he came to me today. Why did he come to me? Why did he stage a hysterics? He fell on the table' crumpled the papers. Rolling' he wanted to steal your papers. They were just some insignificant notes. Garin's address: Rue de Chemin Vert' 63... Rolling! We're finished! He'll hand the notes to the police. He sat there with his double' just like in Leningrad. I have to warn... - What? What? - l'll be right back. lt's not me who was killed. You killed Victor Lenoir' my assistant. A guillotine awaits Rolling. l've got incontrovertible evidence. Alive. Alive! Why are you here? I was looking for Gaston. Who? The man I ordered to kill you. l've guessed that. lf he had killed you' I would've taken my life. I don't understand. I don't understand it myself. Have you come for Rolling's autograph? - Yes. Have mercy. - For him - never. No. Have mercy for me. I sacrificed my friend in order to ruin your Rolling. l'm a murderer like him. To be merciful? No. Let's go. l'll take you out through the park. Rolling' Rolling' we're finished. Rolling' Rolling' we're finished. Rolling' Rolling' we're finished. Has Madame come yet? What do you want? What do you want? Quiet. Don't shout. l'm not going to kill or rob' l'm here on business. What business can it be? You're like a thief... Excuse me. My last name is Leclerc. My first name is Gaston. l've never been a thief. So go away. Go away. lf I go away' Mademoiselle Montrose' whom you know' will be dead. You know where Mademoiselle Montrose is now? Of course' I do. Zoya Montrose is now in the Blackbird Hotel with a man dressed in a black coat and a hat. l'm calling the police. You'll go with me. I think' Mister Rolling' it would be wiser not to involve the police in this matter. We can manage on our own. Madame Montrose entrusted me with sending to his forefathers' through an easy death' an engineer living at Rue de Chemin Vert' 63. Her instructions have been carried out. We could get to a guillotine! All right' all right. Where're your people? Let's go. Here's my apparatus. lt took two years of struggle and cost the lives oftwo of my assistants to build this apparatus. l've reduced the beam to the width of a knitting needle. What can you offer me in exchange for Rolling? l'm an expensive woman. The olivine belt. What? The olivine belt. lt's hard to explain. - Hello? - Hello' Garin. lt's Shelga's speaking. From Leningrad. Remember me? What do you want? I have a message for you from Mantsev. Come here in an hour. ln twenty minutes we'll have to leave. A man called' who came from the Soviet Union. He wants to persuade me to return. So you're asking what the olivine belt is? lt's the power over the world' that's what the olivine belt is. l'll hire your Rolling to be my doorkeeper. You'll be notjust a rich woman' but a very rich woman. l'll build your temples on all the five continents and crown your images with grapes. How vulgar. I hope you're joking. No' l'm notjoking. Two years of struggling' and l'll get through the boiling olivine. All right. The olivine belt is in the future. What do you have now? Two cars' eight men. They came for us. Those seem to be Rolling's cars. Make up your mind' Zoya' yes or no. There won't be another chance. You're crazy. Run for your life! Eight men is nothing! No matches. Matches! A telegram' open up! Slip the telegram under the door. When you're told ''open up''' you ought to open up. - ls the woman here? - Yes' here. - Give her up' and we'll leave you. - Get out! ln a minute none ofyou will be alive. Gaston! Done away with everybody. lt's me' Shelga! Take care ofthe apparatus! l'm waiting! Get out. lfyou're staging a death verdict here' I protest! ln the name ofthe law' in the name of humanity' as a Christian' I protest! l'm offering... a ransom. Any ransom. I might as well have killed you there. - A ransom. - No. My participation in your strange enterprises? Yes. All right' l'll receive you tomorrow. l'll have to think over your proposals again. Right here. Don't be silly' Rolling. And your behavior' Mademoiselle... lt's unheard of! Treachery' debauchery! Go to hell! Talk with Garin. Come here. I need your money. I will blow up your competitors' plants and you'll become the chemical king ofthe whole world. There're four of us here' not three. He's a witness. - Who's he? - Sign it. Garin' get the apparatus! So you've seen the hyperboloid in action with your own eyes? Yes' I have. Guns' gases' airplanes are just kids' games. lt's not Garin alone involved here. Garin and Rolling. Yes... The lethal machine and billions. One could expect anything. But really' what can they do now? What do you mean 'what'? I could get a bullet through the window. But Garin needs me. He knows I have the coordinates of Mantsev's winter stay. He will come to me. Too bad you didn't manage to take the apparatus from him. I hadn't figured out the right move. I had no time to think. And Garin had thought out everything in advance. He and Rolling are up to committing a crime. Right. Of course. That's why we have to inform the chief of police. No. Then we'll lose both Garin and the apparatus. Damn it! What do they want? To rule over the world. Absolutely. Garin... He must be building now a huge model ofthe apparatus at a crazy pace. He promised Rolling to blow up chemical plants. You see? They'll stop at nothing. Killing millions of people just for profit! - I have to do something. - Be careful. l'm going to warn my colleague' Doctor Wolf. He's connected to those chemical plants. What's the news' Wolf? lf only you saw how those representatives ofthe authorities exchanged glances and laughed when I was putting myself out before them. They laughed? They didn't believe me. I don't know what to do now. Why didn't you come to me sooner? I had no facts' just suppositions. Everything's bordering on fantasy' mysticism' the devil knows what! We could end up looking like fools. Thank you. A human mind has limitations. But for our business it would be sensible to rely on it. Even assuming we don't find anything here and all this is just your imagination' that would be only for the better. Of course. - We've done our duty. - Certainly. Wolf. But let's give it a try' anyway. Let's see. Let's look from over there. I guess only from here you can hit with a beam. Yes. Suppose Garin had set the apparatus up here. There must be some traces left. How about it' Wolf? We should inspect the ruins. Waiter! Here' please. Thank you. Goodbye. Look at the map' Wolf. The railway' there it is. The stop. The castle. You understand? Have you heard it? Damn! What could it be? lt was a cry of some night bird. I think we're beginning to hallucinate. - We must get away. - Yes. What is this' Wolf? The birds are on fire! - They get caught in the wire. - What wire? Don't you see it' Wolf?! - lt's Garin. - Garin! Garin!!! lt's madness! Shelga. What... what are you doing? Sit down. How do you feel? Believe me' it's not my fault. That bastard Rolling is responsible for the misfortune in the forest. - You can believe me. - No' I don't. Tonight you're to be killed by Rolling's agents. I must save you. Let's go' every minute is precious. All right' you'll take me away. What's then? l'll hide you in a safe place for a while. Don't be afraid. l'm not going. You'll be killed anyway. Nurses' guards - they're all bought by Rolling. You'll be strangled in your sleep. You won't outlive this night. Rolling needs to take away witnesses' don't you realize it? I said' l'm not going! I don't want to. All right. Then l'll do without your consent. What do you mean' without my consent? Just like that! The documents. The photo. Comrade Shelga' give me your word that you won't try to escape' make a row' in a word' attract the police's attention. l'm giving you my word. My word to kill you at the first opportunity' Garin. l'm giving you my word to take the apparatus from you and destroy it. Shut up' idiot! l'm sorry' l... ...got too heated. Don't be angry. I think we'll find a common language with you. Right? Try to. Well' I need Rolling with his billions just for the time being. Like he needs me only for a while. I think he already realizes that' notwithstanding his stupidity. Of course. God forbid the model of my apparatus getting into his hands. You must understand what it would mean for the Soviet Russia. What do you want? That's a different talk. What an idea - killing me! You and I are enemies' Shelga' but we must work together. ln your view' l'm a bastard and an ultimate individualist. - Well' and a scoundrel' too. - Exactly. You got me right. l' Pyotr Garin' by the will ofthe forces creating me' with my brains... Don't smirk' Shelga. With my greed and unscrupulousness' l'm literally opposing the mankind! Are you playacting a superman? lt's nothing new. What do you want from me? l'm very curious. Where's the rest ofthe text? There must be the coordinates here. l'm not going to tell you that. - ls Mantsev alive? - Yes' he's alive. Where's he? Any sum of money. I don't want it. So you're turning it down. Will you agree to take it for the model of my apparatus? You think l'll cheat? Think well: will I cheat or not? I agree. You won't be seeking my death in the nearest future? ln the nearest future' no. Only give your word that you'll be playing in good faith and won't cheat. All right. For a while we'll hide the model ofthe apparatus in a safe place. Now you'll be taken upstairs. lt's too damp here. Get well' eat and drink to your heart's content. Then you'll have a little sea journey. l'm offering you a dangerous work. You'll get more than from Rolling. You'll go to Leningrad and find the boy. That's him. ls this boy lvan Gusev? What business is that ofyours? Sorry. But first be polite' comrade. My name is Levy. Arthur Levy. So what? l'm an official ofthe Soviet embassy. Are you satisfied' comrade? Can you confirm that the photograph is actually ofthis boy? Yes. The photo was given me by Shelga. Yes' yes' Shelga. l'm entrusted with a secret mission to take the boy to the indicated address. Are you going to submit? The mandate? Please. Everything seems to be correct. Look' maybe someone else can go instead of him? - The boy has to study. - Don't be afraid. The boy will be fine with me. Across the wide' snow-covered expanses of Siberia' Vanya Gusev had led the expedition to Mantsev's winter lair. Bread. Bread. Nikolai Khristoforovich' don't you recognize me? No. No. l'm not used to people. I haven't eaten bread for so long. l'm lvan Gusev. I did everything as you told me. l've brought those people to you. Who are these people? A learned expedition. Why are they here? l'll show nothing to them. Nikolai Khristoforovich' you have to calm down. Please' eat and take a rest. We can't take you out of here before spring. I want to talk to you confidentially. lt was Pyotr Petrovich Garin who sent me for you. ls Garin alive? He didn't forget about me? lf only Garin could get a hundred thousand! What we could have done then! Garin is in possession of billions! He's in all the world's newspapers! He did build the hyperboloid! Garin... I shared with him the idea of a hyperboloid. He's stolen my brains and left me to rot in the damned taiga! What can I take from life now? A bed' a doctor and chicken broth. Oh' Garin... The devourer of someone else's ideas! Garin remembers about you. Scurvy has eaten my teeth' my brains got dull. l'm almost blind. Garin thought of me too late. Oh' it's too late. He remembers about you. He has sent me to bring you back. Soon a dirigible will be here. I would like to know where you're taking me. I don't understand what you need my life for. You're a funny man' Shelga. Now I know those coordinates. l'm taking you to the Golden island. lt's a natural show of interest for a close bedding of gold. l'll be able to get as much of it as I want. Why go so far? The olivine belt is everywhere. Oh' Shelga' Shelga... Here the olivine belt is at 12 km' and there at 5. But why do you need me? lt doesn't make any sense. lt does. Yes? Bring it in. You'll come useful. l'm offering you a salary of 50 thousand dollars. Will you go? No. You want to change the world? I want it' too. But my way. What will you start with? Stamping gold coins with a bearded profile? And with Madame Zoya on the back? You can't forgive me my beard. l'll show you my hand. I need you as a hostage. The landmarks on my way are Rolling with his billions' the hyperboloid and Mantsev' whom you know. The hyperboloid has been built. Rolling is on the ''Arizona''. You'll get your freedom when Mantsev is here. An inquiry in the Parliament. Garin got 20 million pounds from a bank! The ''Arizona'' yacht is crossing the Pacific! Garin has made grandiose purchases at Rolling's expense! Garin's hyperboloid cuts through any armor and opens the way into the bowels ofthe earth! lt's about you. Do you hear? Listen' Arthur' or whatever your name is' stop tricking me. I don't believe Garin. My formulas and notes are soldered in a tin box and securely hidden. l'll fly away' but they'll remain here. No one will get them. Even Garin won't. I won't give them up under torture. Well' you're dealing with honest people. Come on' I know Garin. He hates me' because it was I who invented Garin. Without me' he would have been just a small-time swindler. You'll take with you just my live brain' not the notebooks with formulas. Arthur Arthurovich' the dirigible is descending! Did you hear? Where's my box? Who took my papers? Calm yourself. You! You stole my formulas' my papers! A human brain is incapable of creating all that... I forgot... I forgot everything. You have to calm down' Nikolai Khristoforovich. That boy took them! What the devil! The men are exhausted. They're looking for the boy. We can't take offwithout him. - The mast won't hold. - Hold it! Hurry! Move it! To the cabin. Do we take off' Arthur Arthurovich? Start'er up' guys! We're flying! Hold it! The boy! My formulas! My papers! Wait! Wait! Wait! Garin has seized an island in the Pacific and declared himself its owner. He built a gold mine on it. Here're Mantsev's diaries. I ask you to rise in memory of him. Now we've got a lot cleared up. The olivine belt has three layers. The middle belt is iron and nickel. The upper one is slags. And' finally' the lower' third' layer is gold' platinum and mercury. Day and night' we're getting deeper and deeper' to the inexhaustible reserves of gold. The Siberian placers' the goldfields of California' it's just peanuts' a cottage industry. We've got gold under our feet! We just have to break through the boiling olivine. This morning we got down lower than the magnetic belt. All the instruments are pointing to zero. Gold must be above. Bullshit! We shall find gold! This morning we're taking mercury. We must continue! Mantsev couldn't be mistaken. Gold is above! We go up! Listen. We're just plain stupid! Mercury and gold are boiling side by side. So what do we get? lt's mercuric gold! Mercuric gold. Mercury has a golden tint! lt's 90 percent pure gold! Engineer Garin is the greatest adventurer! The Golden island mine should be filled up as soon as possible! Well? What' my dear gentlemen? The fleet has been ordered to bombard. To level the island with the ocean. What's the matter? Are you so worried about the fleet approaching? Eight battleships. Their salvo amounts to a billion kilograms. We'll manage the squadron' l've got two hyperboloids. The squadron's approaching. l'm taking a decision. l'll trust Shelga with the secret ofthe big hyperboloid. Shelga' the hour has come. I have foreseen this. You'll help destroy the fleet. - A nice job. - Bullshit! Your task is to sink the battleships. Don't even dare to refuse. lfyou do' l'll shoot you. Yes or no? No. Provocateur! Bastard! Drop this thing! I don't believe you. You've already lied to me three times! lnto the shaft! Breathe mercury! And the boy goes down there too! Let's go and have breakfast. And crack a bottle of champagne. Well' your dream has come true. You can institute the Order of Divine Zoya now. Now you're the queen ofthe Golden island. You're a fop' Garin. You're a terrible man' you love nobody. Except you. When l'm in power' l'll have you hanged from the hyperboloid's tower. Hello! Hello! The time has come to talk seriously. How about it? All right. Speak on. l'm listening. Please. I suggest again that we cooperate. Are you surprised? l'll explain. l'm an organizer' I want to restructure your whole cumbersome capitalistic system. lf I don't do it' the communists will gobble you up. You might ask... why I need you' Rolling' when I have inexhaustible reserves of gold under my feet? Yes' I would like to ask that. - Have gin with pepper. - Cayenne pepper? Yes' it will stir up your imagination. We're going to arrange a few hot days for the mankind. We'll bring people to the very edge of a horrible abyss. Listen' Garin. l'm a practical man. Here's my plan. In those days of tremendous panic, I... I mean' we shall buy everything - all plants and factories' the entire air force' the marine. ln a word' the whole world... ...we'll grab it by the throat. lt's a bold idea' I agree. We must prepare the opinion ofyour colleagues there' on the continent. Meanwhile we shall shower the world with gold. Citizens ofthe world! Garin is speaking to you. I got to the bowels ofthe earth. At the depth of 12 kilometers the shaft penetrated a massive layer of boiling gold. l'm offering you my commodity - gold! The price is 2.5 dollars a kilo. What is engineer Garin aiming at? What will happen to the ratio between the labor and the living if they begin to dig gold like clay? Production and trade will be ruined. Big cities will die. Convene a conference! Gentlemen' l'm Garin. l've brought gold to the world. What's the matter' Vanya? I want to go home. Be patient' soon you'll go home. But first I need to do something. While Garin is away from the island' we have to seize the big hyperboloid. l'm pretty good at climbing. I climbed up cedars back in Siberia. Did you really? You'll have to climb up the big hyperboloid tower by a ladder and send the lift down. I can do it. All right' then. Tonight. To the big hyperboloid. You must climb up the tower. Send the lift down' I'll delay them. Sound the alarm! Someone's climbing up the big hyperboloid tower. Alarm! To the tower! Someone's sitting on the tower ofthe big hyperboloid. Get in touch with Garin over radio. We must run. Gari, Garin. The big hyperboloid has been seized. We're going to the open sea. Heading northeast. Fly over here. You know' l'm glad to see you. We blew it' but it's not important. We'll cook up something else. - Why so down in the mouth? - l'm tired. We must recapture the big hyperboloid and the mine. - Head for the island! - Aye head for the island! Look Garin the storm is coming. Or maybe even a typhoon. We must change the course. Bullshit! Full speed ahead. Head for the island. Batten down! Go downstairs. ln a quarter of an hour we'll be in the epicenter of the typhoon. Hitch the lifeboats! Move it! Fire on the Golden island! The hyperboloid has been destroyed! Garin's mysterious disappearance! The ''Arizona'' yacht perished in the hurricane. Where is Garin?
