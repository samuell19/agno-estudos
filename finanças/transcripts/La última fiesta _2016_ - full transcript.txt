Everything's set. The dance floor is over there. The drinks are in the laundry room on ice. Later, when the guests are here, we serve the sandwiches. Then at around 11:30 p.m. I give my speech, we release the balloons and the cake comes out. You think, Alan? It's 11 and nobody's here. They'll come, you'll see. Same as always. If you say so. Son! What did I tell you? Trust me. Son, I brought you a friend. Who is he, dad? Coco's son, the paper guy. The one who brings me my magazines. The porn mags? Erotic! They have good articles. Your father reads them too. Okay, have fun! Bye, sir. I'm Pedro, I brought you a gift. It's a magic necklace, I made it. Thank you. -Here are some chips... -Balloons! No! The balloons were nice. This birthday party couldn't be worse. Happy birthday to you! Wait, dad! -Happy birthday, dear Alan! -Wait, not everyone's here. You told me to bring the cake after the balloons were released. I can't believe it. I'm going to get the camera! Go ahead, Alan, make a wish. I want to throw incredible parties. With a lot of people and gorgeous girls. What do you want? Go on, make a wish. I'll share them with you. I want to be a sketch artist and make a living out of it. Here, Pedro. -Make a wish. -Like what? Whatever you want. I wish you were my friends. Bad wish. Horrible. Smile! THE LAST PARTY Well... the art piece we see here... is a painting... with a pig on a table. Some people call it a hog, others swine. It's an animal on a table. There are two cats as well. It's called Acrylic on Canvas. Here I am. You can't imagine what it's like. My sister's disease is incredible. Diarrhea, vomiting. Old myths. Come closer. That you can't bathe with diarrhea so I asked the doctor. "My sister has diarrhea, can she bathe with it?" And he said, "If she has enough, let her." So we ended up in the hospital, as usual. It has a bit of green as well, like your eyes. Can you believe that guy? He says "A bit of green". The artist spends ten years looking for the perfect shade and the guy says, "A bit of green". Memorize it. He doesn't know anything about the paintings. But everyone is paying attention to him. He could show some respect to the artist. Come on. Atilio. There's an old lady stealing magnets in the store. Give her a scare, it's the third time. Cover me, Dante. I'll take a look and tell you more later. ALAN NUÃ‘EZ TOP REALTOR Alan, it's dad. What site was it where cougars are after sons-in-law? That's all. And get some toilet paper, double ply. Alan, I sent you the info on a mansion for sale. And at nine, people are going to see the apartment you're showing. He'll be free in 15 more minutes. I'll wait, it's okay. I want to see you this weekend. Okay! I want to see you too, don't get jealous. Here, and hold the calls. He's on a conference call with Spain. What are you doing here? Something wrong? Is an ashtray on fire? Did they steal some stickers and we have to evacuate? He wants to show his drawings to Oaklander. -You draw? -Yes. Really? Show me. I can give them to him. No, I can wait. Use me. I have a connection with him. You and I are co-workers. It's alright. I can wait, I have time. Are you shy? The idiot's shy. You have to expose yourself. Besides, we're a team, right? Okay. Let's see. You drew these? Yes. Incredible! This is crap! What is this? They're just doodles. This is kind of hot. I think I saw it in a motel. It's a piece of crap. Listen, I'll show them to him... I'm just messing with you! I don't go to motels. They're kind of gloomy but I can pitch them for you. Make a pitch. How? Sell them to me. In art there are two branches. I'm falling asleep. I'll show them to him. I'll leave them here so Oaklander can see them. Look for me, I'll be around. Thank you. You won't get anywhere with that attitude. REINOSO MOVING COMPANY As you can see, the house is fantastic. 1200 square meters of land, top-notch details, pool, garden, stairs. Marble stairs. -Italian marble. -Very good! Great. I'm glad they recommended you, to sell my house. I love my job. I can sell or rent anything. Actually, I'm the best. Do you live alone? It's the best way to live. I buy and sell houses according to the market. Congratulations, you have very good taste. -For houses and for art. -Thank you. Everything you see here is important and valuable to me. I'm moving everything out upstairs today. I'll clear the downstairs on Monday. I'll be travelling and will be back on Sunday, so you should have all weekend, not should, you have the whole weekend to show the house. No problem. I hope so. Can I trust you? Of course, I'm the best. Well, what happened? It slipped, boss. Sorry. Why are you so scared? I don't like scared men. And I'm sure this can be fixed. I'll take the tail to the shop and it'll be like new again. That's right... the tail to the shop and it'll be fixed again. I only brought it from Rome last week. We'll fix it. If it can be fixed, we'll fix it right now. Can you fix it now? I see it can still be fixed. You do it too. Go ahead, it can be fixed! Harder! It can be fixed! It can be fixed! Can you fix it? Can you fix it? Can you? That's it! Alright. You shouldn't hold on to material things. Over here, like I was saying. -What's up? -Hi! -How are you? -Fine, you? Give me a better kiss! What's new? I'm writing the divorce papers of two 92-year-olds. Can you believe it? Whoa. I'll be with you until I'm 105, if I'm still around, so be prepared. What's for dinner? I see you're very romantic tonight. -I'll make some pasta. -Okay. Will you help me cook? I walked by the real estate agency on the corner. -Yeah? -I saw... a nice apartment we could rent, good price. -That's good. -The realtor said I could see it tomorrow. It's a little bit bigger, lots of light. It's nice. -So you went in the agency. -Yes, I went in. I didn't know we were looking. No, I just walked by and asked. You're really pressuring me. -What do you mean? -Yeah, I don't know. I just walked into the agency, I didn't ask you to propose. -You had to bring it up. -What? -Marriage, moving, big wedding... -You're such an asshole. -How much is that stupid apartment? -Why "Stupid"? Okay, the cute apartment with three rooms. That's right, three bedrooms, bigger than this one. How much is it? -A little more than this one. -Yeah... But I can pay the difference. Is this a shelter or are we a couple? -Why are you so sexist? -I'm sexist? -Yes. -You think so? Instead of paying rent, why don't you cut my balls off and boil them? That's delicious. -What? -What's wrong? Nothing. Tell me. I took my drawings to the curator. He didn't like them? Maximiliano was there and he started mocking me. So I didn't get to see him. -What? -Nothing. Why did you do this and roll your eyes? -You always have an excuse. -You have something to say? Yes, six months ago your drawings weren't finished. -A year ago you couldn't find a technique. -Hold on. Wait, that's my job. Do I tell you how to write up a divorce? No. Then don't butt into my job. I butt in because I'm 30 years old, we've been living together for six years and we live in a house that looks like a hostel, Dante. I think you're a control freak. You only want me to make money. -Is that what you think? -Yes, you want me to make money. You've been a security guard for five years. You have a college degree, and it's not about the money! -Yes, it's about the money! -No, it's not. You brought up the apartment, that it's nice, it's about the money. You're manipulative, materialistic, you only cook noodles. Look what you do to me! That's good. Sorry. Why are you so cruel to me? -Sorry, I went too far. -Why do you take it out on me? -I'm sorry, babe. -Forget it! -Come here. -Let go! Wait, stop, I'm sorry, honey. How was your day? If she's not her mom, why is she sucking her? They say they're mother and daughter, but they're really not. They play a lot of roles in movies. Is she spitting in her mouth because she hates her? I don't know. -Son! -Hi, dad. What did we say about these movies? Get some air and go for a walk. You're young and at your peak. You have parties, real women. I'm all alone and it's hard. But I can take it, that's life. And listen, the doctor said that one a day is good for you. You're going to hurt yourself. Who cares? Just like that. She said she has doubts, doesn't know what she feels. -Just like that, she said it? -Just like that. How are you? Great, I'm 33, minimum wage and live in your dad's house. I have to eat before I take my pill. You're taking it the wrong way. You look fine, you're at your peak. I feel old, we're getting old. No, that's how you feel. -I'll get dizzy if I don't take... -Wait a minute, this is important. We're your friends, brothers, we'll always be with you. You'll be fine, we're going to support you. I know what this is about. What are you talking about? You're using this situation to throw a party. -No. -Are you doing that? No, no! Don't get Pedro mixed up. That's not it, but let's be honest. We're friends, brothers, but you haven't been to a real party for 20 years. Something happened, you don't have to lie. -Correct me if I'm wrong. -You never lie. -If I do, correct me. -Don't lie, I don't need to. -Tell me the truth. -I am. -Perfect, something unplanned happened. -Magic? No, well, yes, something magical like you say. A beautiful house came up. A place where we can do something intimate. Well, I don't want to see anyone or drink anything. Okay? Okay, we'll respect that. We'll respect you. -We'll do whatever he says. -We respect you, Dante. It's true. WELCOME BACK, DANTE LEVIN! -Lots of drugs. -Lots of everything! I brought a bar, a fire eater, a mechanical bull, LED lights. This is going to explode! Around 2 AM there's a speech so everyone knows who threw the party and then fireworks. I want to go home. Fine, go. And watch a porn with my dad. I want a steak, is there any food? Sure, there's a BBQ. But there's no steak! It's all finger food. There are sausages, go get some. And drink something, get drunk. Hey! Everyone for Dante! Hey, it's great seeing you! So great! thanks for coming. Who are you, Blondie? Alan, I threw the party. There are people jumping on the matts, with their shoes on, I paid a deposit. -Okay, good evening. -Hello, good evening. I'm with some people. This is Snoop Dog... Droopy Dog. An incredible band, Altos Gatos. You know them? No. But I don't listen to a lot of music. He's Dante, we threw this party for him. He recently split up and he's sad. When I want to forget a woman I write music. -It gets her off my mind. -The mind. Art rises from suffering. "Ass crack". Huh? -I wrote it for my first girlfriend. -First girlfriend. Wow, she must be thrilled. You like to get it hard I'm happy when it's dark I'm new when it's dark I draw your... I draw your... I draw your crack and it hurts. -You're fantastic! -You've got something. That's what they do. They're the Altos Gatos. How weird, Altos Gatos. And you have a dog name. What's that? Your name is Droopy, right? That's a dog. -Are you calling me a dog? -What? It's strange. -Your ass is strange! -Yeah. Want some beer? A beer? I'll get one. What a funny guy. -A sausage? -A sausage? -A sausage. -Sausage. -A sausage. -Sausage. Did you come by yourselves? We're with some girls that came from the show. Hey, aren't you Dante? Are you Dante? -Yes, have we met? -No. You're on the balloons. Thanks for coming. Thanks for inviting me. -What's your name? -Vicky. What's this shit? Nice picture, right? Sort of. I like the colors, sort of Arcimboldo in its shape. -I think it sucks. -Please! I think it sucks too. I didn't know what to say to start a conversation. Everything you do touches me deeply. Always, your lyrics, your music. "Sweat On This", for example. Ever since I first heard it, I feel it inside. I wrote that song. It's a metaphor on social struggles. Revolutions. Want something to drink? Yes, bring me some vodka. With lemon. A screwdriver. Ice, orange. I'll be right back. We'll keep talking. Alan, Alan! Sorry, I thought this was the bathroom. Do we smell like a bathroom? Calm down, Mask. -It's burnt lemon. -What? Hey! Take it easy. -Bong? -Pedro. -Yes, I'm Dante's friend. -I meant if you want some bong. What is it? -A bond. -A bond. Besides being a balloon model, what do you do? I'm a failed artist. -Really? Me too! -Yes. You failed too? In what? I do disruptive social art. Disruptive social art. -That's art, what is "disruptive"? -That's not art. It's a new way of showing society their hypocritical spots. Their hidden places. Places they could never reach otherwise. Oh, a GPS. She created the GPS, guys. Here I am. -Have you seen the bottle opener? -Of course, this is my property. -Congratulations. -Thanks! You're the first to congratulate me. My friends ask, "Why a house so big?" "Ten bathrooms, gardens. Isn't the pool too big?" And I tell them I want to fill it with love. -You're Droopy's friend, right? -No. I went to see them and I came here by chance. No, there's a reason. I believe in causes. The universe brings people together. I believe everything is written. Does it say where the bottle opener is? Yes. Sorry. Trash. What was your name? Alan. You? Listen, Alan. Take it easy. When you're the owner of a house, you call it "house", not property. No one calls the place where they live "property". Only realtors do. So if I had to guess, you're selling the house and decided to throw a party. Shooting! Shooting! Shooting! Shooting! I'm the man! Come on! Let it flow. Move your hair! Move your hair! Move your hair! Move your hair! Move your hair! The party isn't for me, it's for a friend. His wife just dumped him and I want to cheer him up. The only talent I have is selling houses. I want to kill myself, I just lost my chance to drink wine with the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Okay. Show me. What? Your talent. His own way His own way His own way of moving his hair His own way His own way His own way of moving his hair His own way His own way His own way of moving his hair His own way His own way His own way of moving his hair His own way His own way His own way of moving his hair I worked a lot with taboo. With losing inhibitions. For example. You, on the other hand... are a more classical guy. Right? That's alright too. Not like my friend here. I'm very self-demanding. I don't allow myself to try new things. Comforting things. Sometimes I want... No! No, wait! These are the only pants I have. Let's clean it up. No! They're the only pants I brought. -You want mine? -No, wait. This carpeted beauty... is the master bedroom. Quite large. Do you like it big? Do you want to reserve it? No, I want to think it over. I wouldn't think too much, you might lose it. Really? I don't know. I think hasty decisions are mistakes. Look at that, I think you have to take chances. Take a leap. Sorry. Like this? Should we lock the door? And unlock our inhibitions? Unleash our passions? Huh? Give in to our wildest desires? Should I tear my clothes off? And let my breasts fall against your legs? While I run my tongue... down your neck to your pelvis? Should I crawl towards you slowly... and show you all this while I meow lightly? Yes. Yes. Kitty cat. Should I put your fingers here? Inside me? So you can feel all the juices that I produce just thinking about all the things you'll do to me? -My mouth is watering. -Eat. And I want to share it only with you. Yes... You're the best realtor on the planet. I'm about to surrender. It's coming. It's coming. -Here it comes. -Together. Here it is! -I can't take anymore! -Together. I'm sorry. Forgive me for everything. -Wow, it's on. -Don't even think about it. Okay. No! No! One, two, one two. Come in, this is great! Come on! Chicken! Chicken! Sausage! Dante! Dante! You're in your underwear. Are you okay? It may seem abrupt, but part of my social experiment is doing it with strangers. Want to? I'll wait here. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Water... water. Water! -Marco! -No! Pedro, no! God damn it, Pedro! Let it all out! If you keep it inside... you blow up. Believe in yourself. It's all yours. Get out there and grab it! No, not two fingers. It's too much. Not two fingers. One finger. Get off, dummy. Get off me. Did you stick a finger in me? Get off me. What a party! This... He's a genius. Good morning, genius. I saw you last night. You were with a girl. I threw up on her. Incredible, women these days. I met a girl too. I think I'm in love. Surprising. Great, the owner of the house arrives tonight. The android put everything in its place. Fortunately, the universe conspires in our favor. Wasn't there a painting there? The painting is missing. Did someone steal it? Yes, there was a painting here. And it must be very expensive. Expensive? it was a shitty skull. Guadalupe! -Who? -Guadalupe! the girl I fell in love with! She stole it! It was a nice gesture. What? You saw me do that? And you let me? Why? Because you were happy. Where were you? Who? Say goodbye to me. I'm a dead man. You don't know this guy. They stole a painting. It must be worth millions of dollars! No, it's not. The frame was the most expensive part. No, Dante, it was over the chimney! If it's over the chimney, it's important! He'll kill me! Calm down, he won't kill you. Call the chick, tell her you were drunk and have her give it back. I don't have her number. Then he's going to kill you. -Hello? -Droopy, it's Alan. -Who are you? -I threw the party. -The dentist? -What? What party? Last night, big night, pool, girls. Take that thing out of your mouth, no! You can't eat that! Sorry, you're with the kids? No! You have a dog. Mine used to chew everything. Not that either. What do you want? Sorry, last night you came with a bunch of girls. One was a really pretty, nice eyes and juicy lips. She had a skull tattoo. Donâ€™t tell me she passed out there? -No, she's fine. -Thank goodness man. I need to find her. I can't believe they didn't pick us up. They could've met us in the city, right? I'm cold, can we go? No! They're coming because of you. They'll come, trust me. -You trust me? -No. You don't? -No. -Okay. -Let's do an exercise I learned. -Magic? No, a trust exercise. Companies do it. -Can I do it? -Yes. -If you want to... -No, go ahead. You do it, turn around. -You have to trust me. -Yes. -Eyes closed? -Yes. -Okay, Pedro trust me. -Yes. -Arms out. -Okay, you fall back and I catch you. -I'm breathing. -Trust one. -I trust you. -Trust two. -I'm loose. -Trust three! I trust you! He trusted you, great. Very good. I feel better now. Hey, guys! That's the cool man! Can I open my eyes now? And he drank the water in the pipe! -Because I was thirsty. -He's wild! A real animal. What's this? No! It's my medication that I have to take. Sure, you're going to take it. We all are or will you inhale it? Will you inhale it? -Where am I going? -I'd give him his medication. -Don't be a rat, dude. -Dude! Are we close? Yes, but we need to make a technical stop. We can get some water. Or some beer, how's that? This is what we'll do. We stop here. -And you go get a friend called Doll. -Doll. -He's on a boat called Mar Bravo. -Mar Bravo. You give him the money and take the package. And then we keep rolling. No way, when do we get off? We're not getting off. We're very grateful, we really are. But this isn't my thing. If you want an apartment, great. We can't be seen here. You have to go. What? Are you a gang? Oh, you're an urban tribe. Because of Droopy's dad. -Shut up, Mask. -Shut up, Onion. Shut up, fatty. Who's your dad? He's a big judge. -Shut up, Mask. -Shut up, Onion. He's a judge. Your dad's a judge? Shut up, fatty. It's okay, we invited you to smoke. Now we're going to get the blonde chick. -Redhead. -Redhead. Carolina. Guadalupe. And all we ask is one little favor. It's called an eye for an eye. There's 60,000. Doll, you said? This doesnâ€™t look good. Wait! they're going to kill us. -Let's get going. -They set us up. No, we have to do this! -These guys are gang members. -No, it's alright. One gang fights with another gang... Are you okay, Pedro? He's fine, those pills are light. We're the other group, a gang. Hello! Hello! It's here. We're going to die, man. Since we're going to die and we're a gang, let's name ourselves. At least we get to be famous. Let the news say, "The gang that died on a boat". What should we be called? "Two Idiots with Alan, the Junkie"? Hello? -Let's do this fast. -Shut up! This is cool. You hear that? I hear something. Excuse me, good evening. This is it. Yeah, come in. We're looking for Doll. Droopy sent us. I'm Doll, hi. -It's here. -How are you? My mother, Norma. You said no one comes after 9 PM. We don't want to bother you. It's alright! my mother was just making something to eat. Take a seat! -Mom! -Coming. Is he alright? Yes, he just needs his medication. Meds, yeah, I get it. I got Droopy's package, it's all ready. And we've got the money. Thank you so much! We were getting hungry. I'll have some chicken too. It's fine. You like this? Everything's homemade. We have a bunch of things to distribute. We've got weed, LSD, acid, crystal. We've got speed, if you want, but you don't. Mushrooms. Mom, do we have mushrooms? If you want mushrooms, move your ass and get them yourself. I'll get your set ready. Homemade, real fast. Don't eat so much, hurry up. Did you see how fast he moved? I'll take care of him. -What do you mean? -Trust me, it's fine. Why should I? I know how to handle these people. Trust me. What are you talking about? Here's your stuff ready. Delicious! And I added a pill for your friend, he doesn't look good. Thank you very much. Everything's delicious. But there's a change of plans. I won't give you 60, I'll give you 30. Wait! There's been a mistake here! You just hit my friend and we didn't do anything. What mistake? Doll doesn't bargain with prices. We're not bargaining. We have Droopy's package. It won't be that easy, pal. You came and disrespected me. Now you have to repent. Repent! I'm sorry, he's sorry. I've known him for 30 years... What's going on? Are they screwing you over again? -He broke my nose! Look! -No, I think that... I want you to be sorry! Now I want twice the money! Ma'am, can you do me a favor? Talk to your son. I'll get the gun. No, Norma no! Norma? Don't talk to my mom like that! Don't be so cheeky! Speak well! Speak! Speak well! Pedro! They screwed you again! Don't run, you pussies! Everyone started saying: "Buy Bitcoin". Well. The benefits are good. But I don't know. You know. They go up, then down. And then you have them... Let's go! Come on! Come on, let's go! We have to get out of here! Let's get out of here! Run, you pussies! Where's the blinker? I can't drive without a mirror. In your ass! you idiot! I can't believe you screwed the Doll. I was wrong about you. It wasn't me, it was that idiot. Careful with my nose! You're a real dog! I need that girl, man. Get inside, Pedro! You're going to kill yourself, idiot! Mask, get the girl. Wait, sit down a minute. We have to wait a while. I'd rather get the girl, I know her. What you did for the gang was good. You stuck your necks out. But not your asses. What? We're connected. Anything you need, here I am. I'd like half the money. I got my nose hurt. -No, not that. -Can you take me home later? -No. -Great. Whatever, an eye for an eye. I'm going to piss. Ricardo! -God damn it! -What? Nothing, a bug. I can't believe it. -What? -This guy, this place. Now I get why Julieta left me. No, that's different. Julieta met a rustic, useless defender and now she expects the perfect man. I told her I'd take my drawings to the museum's curator. What happened? I didn't have the nerve, I'm a coward. I went to his office with my drawings and when I was going, I shit my pants. You shit your pants? Not literally! I just didn't have the nerve to show them. I don't get it, you're talented! You're the only one that does something well. You're a great painter. Go talk to him. Tell him, "I'm the next Dali, make the most of me." Dali isn't my style, I'm not that good. I can't say it like that. That's your mistake. You start by saying you can't. Be positive! don't say no! I read it in a self-help book. Seems dumb, but it's deep. This isn't Guadalupe. -What? -That's what I was saying. I'm Roncha, I've been coming here for five years. Marta's daughter. Your aunt? You're his cousin? She's your cousin? That's right! I'm sorry, man. I don't know who the girl is. He brought us here for nothing! Are you shouting at me? No, sorry, the skaters are loud. I misheard you. I'm off, bye. How's Sandra? -Now what? -I don't know, I'm leaving. -No, you're staying. -What can I do? Tell the guy the painting is a piece of crap, it's worthless. Just tell him the truth. Tell him about the party, that's it. I have to go to work. You stay, if you want. Alan, Alan, Alan! Alan, Alan, Alan! Mr. Osmar. I see you're on every detail. I wanted to talk to you about the painting. It's missing, you noticed, I see. Let me explain. I was showing the house. A nice couple. He's 33, she's 25, younger. With a daughter, two years old. No, two and a half. She was drinking her bottle. I don't know what happened. She was holding her bottle, we couldn't control her. She squeezed it and the milk flew. It went straight to the painting, it was a mess. I'm having it cleaned. I think I'll have it in a week. Okay, you got me. I made a mistake. We threw a party in your house. Music, drugs, pool. It was crazy. I have no idea where the painting is but I swear I'll pay for it. I didn't do it on purpose. That's the truth. I hope you can understand... God damn it! Hello? Yes, it got complicated. I'm investigating. Nobody came yet. Who? Tiziana? What are you doing in my Facebook, Alicia? No, I'm not her friend! I'm not at an event! Alicia, please! I told you where I am! I'm in a house where I killed a guy because I didn't get the merchandise. You didn't want to know? Then you shouldn't have asked! Well... You're asking one stupid question after another. What? Yes, chicken fried steak is fine. With rice. There's no rice? I spent a bundle at the supermarket! I don't understand, Alicia. Order takeout. There's real danger in the tub, I broke my hip in it. Good thing the neighbor heard. He brought warm water and unstuck my testicles that were stuck to the cold tub. The building is called museum, I'm Maxi, two different things. Go outside, I'll be right with you. -Right or left? -Huh? Which hand are you jacking-off with? We're working! Strange way of working. You're quite curious today. You shouldn't talk to me like that, I got you a meeting with Oaklander. Really? No. I left him your drawings, but he doesn't have time. He's with other shit. You draw, Dante? Yes, I do. He draws numbers. Look at that Russian face. Don't get upset. I'm going to kick your ass. Really? You are? Go on then. Is it your mom? No, yours. Oh, yeah? Dante, listen to me! I'm at the mansion, it's over. Wait a second. Pichincha Street and Caracas. The owner of the painting was killed, wait. Take the bridge so we avoid the train. We're in danger, mainly you! No, you didn't listen. I said to take the bridge. Then stop the clock. Hello, Dante! The guy knows who you are. This isn't a joke! I have to go, the cabbie's an ass. Julieta! Julieta! Julieta! What? What are you doing here? -How are you? -What are you doing here? -You have to leave. -Listen, baby. Don't call me "baby" after the other day. -You're right about the other day. -I know. We're in danger, you have to listen to me. -We have to go! -Look, I'm shaking! You're a sexist in disguise and you can't see reality. Please! Sexist in disguise? That's right! I'm a lawyer and I can defend myself. My mother told me so since I was this small, and... Wait, don't open the door. What? This is my house. We're separated. Alright, we're separated. We're an ex couple. -How are you? -Fine, you? -Fine, still manipulating? -Still an asshole? Did this six year relationship mean anything to you? I don't know. Make it worth something. I'm asking you not to open the door. I can do whatever I want. This is my house! I need you to leave because you're being dark and I need light in my life. All you bring is darkness. I need light, love, harmony, peace! Okay? Light! Are you finished? -I told you not to open the door. -Are you kidding? I can't believe our relationship was worthless to you. Sorry, I didn't know you robbed a painting from the mob. I already explained. I didn't steal a painting from the mob. -Then why is he here? -I don't know, let me talk. Okay... where's the painting? Well... Hello. I'm working, Alicia. No, I couldn't go. You want me to keep the groceries in the car all day? I can't! What about the yogurt and the milk? And the... Where is the painting? Someone gave it to a girl. But that girl... We looked for her, but she's not here. She disappeared with the painting. Yeah, like someone's will to thrive. Like a six year relationship. Don't get him upset. Or you'll find out about all the shit he kept inside. -Shut up, go see apartments. -Of course I will. If I wait for you, I'll die here. I think... you don't understand how serious this is. I'll make myself clear. If the painting doesn't show up by tomorrow night, your girlfriend... disappears. 57, you're wanted at the station. 57, 57, you're wanted at the station. This is Gutierrez, Chato. I hear you loud and clear. -So we have to return the painting. -Yes. -Because these people are dangerous. -Exactly. -Who has it? -Pedro, focus please! -You're alive! -The guy kidnapped Julieta. -Idiot! Call the police! -He is the police! I don't want to fight! -All because of that stupid party! -I did it for you! They're fighting, Norberto! Because you didn't have the guts to show your drawings! You got my balls! You got my balls! -I don't want to fight. -You asshole! -I don't want to fight. -You asshole! Stop it. What are you doing? No! -My balls, damn it. -You never won one of these! No, not that! No, that's sacred! It's our dish! No! I've had enough of you! -What happened? -He left. -He's not eating? -No, he left. -But I cooked two packs of hotdogs. -Don't bug me with the hotdogs. -Okay, but what happened? -He got mad at us and left. -Why? -I threw a party. A wild one, in a house I was supposed to rent. That's good! No, you're not listening. I met a girl with a huge mouth, big eyes, sort of redhead. Got a picture? She took me to the bedroom. She had a skull tattoo, threw me on the bed and started talking. And without touching me, she made me cum. By yourself? It got complicated. There was a painting in the house of a skull and then I got drunk and gave it to her. Now the owner is dead and Dante's wife was kidnapped. A big mess. Redhead, big mouth. Skull tattoo. What were her tits like? You're crazy, dad. I can't talk to you. I'm just asking! Don't you see what you did to me? The guys are right. -I'm immature because of you. -Because of me? I always took care of you! These are the cards I was dealt. What cards did you get? -These! -I'm not hungry, your hotdogs are crap. Don't leave, I will! I need to go for a walk. Everybody leaves. Should we lock the door? And unlock our inhibitions? -Unleash our passions? -It's her. We found her! -Give in to our wildest desires? -Whose? Oh, daddy! What have we done to you? Fighting Indians for 20 years! Taking so many lives! Feeding the soil with gaucho blood. And you, daddy... instead of freeing the land of the savages, you sent us the worst plague. The worst plague. The worst plague. Yes, yes. From my father's house I only have this heirloom. An heirloom I will take care of, forever. And ever. You're terrified, scared, move your hands. -I'll get it. -No, no! He'll call the police and we won't get the painting. Get in here! You see the sun! -What are you doing? -I turned it off. Lower your voice, you can't talk here. Hello. I'm security. Your braids, cheekbones. Braids and sun, look up. Open your mouth more. -Don't screw it up. -You're one to talk. I screwed up and now I'll fix it. Here. Have some water and calm down. Keep at it. -Can you taste it? -No. It's Pedro's pill. -You drugged me. -No. You drugged me. You did, didn't you? What? What? I'm the security guard! What are you doing? You killed daddy. That's it, more feline. Like a hyena, a hyena that comes forth. But stays in its place. It smells, comes forth. In its place. In its place, but it comes forth. That's it. Bring your stomach in, but don't show it. -Go all the way. -All the way with what? -Play the animal, another species. -I can't hear you. She's another species. Another species. Work with the subtext. And you're erect. That's it, the gland comes towards your face. It's alive, control it, but not that much. It's a country alien, it's not hygienic. He smells. Put your stomach in. And the gland goes near your face. That's it. Make it touch you. Keep it under control! It's not that easy to handle! I'm asking you to control it. That's it! What the hell are we doing here? Isn't this a porn movie? I came here to stick it in! Alright. No. -No. -We're trying to... Don't touch me. We're trying to make a movie, tell a story. Who the hell is the writer? Look at this girl! People want to see her naked. He's nuts. Dummy! -What did he call me? -Dummy. You want to explain to me how to tell a story? -Is this the wrong set, Mario? -This is it. It's not that hard. She has to strip, I get naked. She eats it up, I get on top, she grabs my balls, I stick it in. You do a close-up, I come on her face, done! -You're disgusting. -Disgusting? Break for lunch. I'm going to my dressing room and return when we can work. Go get inspired, junkie. In Buenos Aires I Banged Her, The Secret of Her Asses, Partners in Ass, Partners in Ass 2, how's that? -Masterpieces! Very good! -You're being ironic. Of course I am! Everybody's falling asleep. Get out of here. I worked with Victor Mailen. Great, go and shave your ass, you asshole! I wanted to get laid! I'm going to jack-off in the bathroom. You shut up! -Hi. -What are you doing here? Nothing. Sorry about Pedro's hushes. -Is something wrong? -No, nothing. -I was walking with my friends... -And you walked onto a porn set. No, a movie set where I saw you working. It doesn't bother me at all. -It doesn't bother me. -Sorry? what doesn't? -The movie set. -That I'm a porn star? -That doesn't sound good. -But I am a porn star. -Not full time. -Full time. -So? -It doesn't bother me. Why it would bother you? It doesn't. I'm a professional actress. I have an honest job. A respected name in the business. I studied and practiced. I broke my ass to get here. -No doubt. -This is crazy. I worked all my life and now an idiot tells me what to do. -Guadalupe... -What do you want? I'm glad you asked. The painting I gave you. My life is at stake and so is Dante's wife's. -Just give it to me. -What are you talking about? Let's have coffee and I'll tell you. Let's have dinner and give me the painting, both. I'm full of ideas. Come on, Mario. Let's stop here and continue tomorrow, Edgar. I won't allow a mediocre monster to interrupt me again. -Director! just a second. -No, wait. Give me a second, please. I need, tell him, can you please tell him. -I threw a party and I need that painting. -No Alan! I'm working. It's not moving until I finish the movie. Who's this? -An acquaintance. -I thought we were more than that. How much longer to finish the scene? Tomorrow at least, the actor left. I need the painting. Okay, groan. You want the painting? groan. Do it Better. More. -He's a natural. -My father is a fan of the genre. Okay now, space lights! I realized Alan's right and so is Julieta. I'm not a brave guy, I don't push forward. And Alan is always very good to me. When I split up and moved in to his house, he took me in with open arms. And I treated him badly! I treated Julieta badly too. I don't know what I would do if anything happened to Julieta. What should I do? Sometimes we need to lose things to understand what they're worth. Right. You need to carry out your dreams. For example, I'm here because I want to be an actress. I won't let any chance go by. I'll surrender myself. You're right. You'll get your chance with Julieta too. You'll know it when the time comes. Matilde, we have to clean the new actor's butt. Bring deodorant and powder. -Okay? -Yes! -Thanks. -Everything will be okay. Action! How is this going? The predator communicates with her in sign language that she learned with her grandfather. Her grandfather was deaf. The monster comes in. Monster! Cut! Cut! I forgot my lines, sorry. -You don't have lines. -Okay. There's a light in the monitor. I don't know. I need some help! Are you okay? Yes? Yes. It's okay. Action! -Cut, no, there's a light. -That light is annoying. I'd like to do it again, I was nervous. I don't see anything. Are you okay? Yes. Let's see. What do you think? It's better. I'm going to take care of you. It'll be fine. -Okay. -There it is again. It's there, Mario! -I don't see anything. -It's obvious, Mario! -You're useless, Mario. -You're useless, Mario. Are you ready? is it okay? Yes, Alan. Action! No, please! -Puppy comes in. -Call him, Mario. Puppy comes in. Two girls? No, please! Cut! Isn't it great that he was an alien, she was from Earth and that he had a human penis? I don't care, Pedro. -Sorry, I was wrong. -It's okay. I have the painting and we're fine, right? You did great in the movie. -And we're going to get Julieta back. -Please. You came in late, I almost had it cut, but... Look who's here! Delivery! Thanks Edgar. Let's go for a ride. Come on. I'm sick of all this. I want to get it all back! I'm sick and tired. Where's the money? We don't have it. They're lying! They're making an ass of you! -Shut up, mom. -I can't talk? Am I a plant? If anyone interrupts me again, I will... It was an accident, Doll. -Tell him I'm not in this so I can go. -She's not in this, let her go. If you're with them, you're in this, besides... you're pretty and I know who you are, you're an actress and you drive me crazy. Careful, bitch. I have to kill him! No, no! -Kill them already! grow up! -No! Let's call Droopy. He has the drugs and the money. He can give it back, I'll call him. -Yes. -It's just one call. You've got one chance. -Hello, Doll? -Hello, Droopy? It's Dante, Alan's friend. The fat guy, Alan's and Pedro's friend. -Oh, ok! -That's it. I'll call you later, I'm screwing Brian's ex-girlfriend. I'm going to turn the phone off a second. -No! Hello! Hello! -Droopy! Hello! -No, no! -Wait, wait! I'll tell him the truth. It's alright, Pedro. You didn't do it, I do it, that's it. We don't have the money. We bought paintings. We're into art trafficking. -Since when? -It's over! You should've done it sooner, Pedro. That's not worth anything, it's a forgery. It's a picture of a big artist. From the 1800's. I'd explain but you'd never understand. There's a lot of money involved. A lot of it. Dollars. If you help us get into the museum and put that forgery inside, there's money for you. How do you plan on getting inside? Good question. How do we get in the museum? Me. Dante, is my friend and my brother. He's the security guard, so... So he can go in whenever he wants. This boy is bright, Mam. Take care of him. We can go in and steal everything! I thought so too, but it's not easy. There are alarms. Laser alarms, on the radar. You pick up a picture and... Right, Dante? Yes. -I'm not lying, am I? -No. You never lie. Then what can we steal? The drawings of the next Dali. They just arrived. Right, Dante? Yes. So if they just arrived, They're not on... They aren't on the... Look at me, not on... -Ra... -Ra... They are not, you can do it. On the radar! Say it right! Just a minute! How do I know you're telling the truth? -Good question, it's about time. -Let me talk. We have this painting, we stole from your son who's a respectable trafficker, and I'm dressed as a museum security guard, what else could we be? You stay with them, I'll go with the guard. -If you see anything strange... -I know what I have to do. Atilio. -Hi. -Hi? Is it Tuesday? No, it's not Tuesday. Then why are you here? I argued with my wife and I'm spending the night here. -Sure? -Yes. I can clear my mind here. That's good because my sister has diarrhea, vomits. Okay, go on then. I'll call if I need you. -Won't he get suspicious? -No, don't worry. Where is it? Upstairs, follow me. -Can you put the gun down? -Let me do this. What are you doing after? Can I give you a lift? Why? Do you have more art to traffic? This will be over in 15 minutes. Do you like calamari? Only when I'm alive. You will be. You and I have a pending matter. And I can't allow that. This is meant to be. -Time for my pill. -Take it. I don't have any more. I gave you the last one on the set. Shut up! This is worth a lot. It's strange, but it's in fashion. You can sell this crap? The artwork itself isn't important. Art has to be a vehicle that moves you. Huh? The artist here shows he's suffering for not being accepted. It may seem gloomy, but inside every drawing there's a story. And that's valuable. Alright, but I'm going to take that laptop just in case. Take whatever you want. Hey! Stand still! -What's going on? -No, no! Drop it. Atilio, that's not necessary. He was just leaving. Where am I going? Where, man? Not now, you're fine. Breathe. Think of something nice. Nice things, kids playing, carousels. You're better now. No, no, no, Pedro! Calm down, Pedro. Shut up. What's wrong with him? It's nothing. Shut him up or I'll beat him. Forget it, I'm crazy. Atilio! Pedro, no! Stay here, it's all over. Mom, what happened? We should've stayed home. I had to shoot them. Now it's a big mess. What happened? The android. He went crazy. Alan! Sorry, I didn't see you! God damn you! Now I really blew it. Can you not screw things up for ten minutes? I did it for you, I put my life at risk. Here. I wish it were only your life. I'm sick of you. Figure it out yourself. Don't give it to me! Don't! Don't! I'm not taking it. It's yours. You take care of it. -It's broken now! -You take care of it! The painting was all an act, it's full of dope. Can you take the gun away from him for once? Did you hear him? say it again. This is dope, the best. And I'm keeping it. You laughed at the Doll. Who's laughing now? I don't know who you are. How you got involved in this... with these characters is beyond me. I just hope that whatever the reason it was worthwhile. Where is Julieta? Enjoying the view. Stay here! You have the painting, you have the dope. Let her go! Why don't you get together over there so we can finish this? You got what you wanted! And I'll always be grateful. But I can't let you live. Your last wish? -I wish you were my friends. -Go on, Alan, make a wish. I have one. I'll share my wish. Wait here. I'm sick of you, Mustache. Come on! I've got him! I've got him! Come here! What's the matter, fatty? Who do you think you are? DANTE LEVIN, SECURITY GUARD Give me that! It's his wife, use your talent. Hello? who is this? He can't come to the phone. I'd have to untie him and he won't like that. No! Don't move. -Who are you? -I'll tell you later. On your knees, sucker. You don't know what you're doing. You can't kill me. To get out of this you'll need a judge, you get me? And with my connections... I've got my own connections. When you mess with an old friendship... Idiot! leave my husband alone! God damn you! asshole! Can you give us a hand with this? Don't worry, an eye for an eye. Right, dad? I've identified the dealer's chief. But I can't involve the police or the drug network would find out and we wouldn't be able to catch them. Dad... Can I keep the stuff in the bag? Wait in the car, Esteban. Alan, Alan, Alan! I found the painting. This story can't come out. We have to make something up, right? I know. -No, no. -Trust me. DRAWINGS WERE NEARLY STOLEN FROM LOCAL MUSEUM THE ARTIST'S AGENT SAYS: "WE ARE SHOCKED" "I REGET IT" Many consider him the next Dali. Ever since it was stolen, critics say it is the future of Argentine modern art. -Pencil on canvas. -Ink. My drawings are ink on canvas. How are you? Listen to me, asshole. Next time you mess with my man, I'll cut your balls off and exhibit them upstairs. -Got it? -Yes... -Yes? -Yes. Excuse me, miss. Is he bothering you? No, Atilio. I'm talking to her. -Is he bothering you? -No. -It's all settled, right? -Yes. Wooden floors, lots of light, the rooms are huge. Many bathrooms. Pool, garden, you like it? It's beautiful, I love it. It's great. Congratulations. And I like to see you get ahead. Don't forget, you can always come back home. I know, dad. But I want to try. -That's good. -I want to try. Hello! Hi. -Are you the owner of the property? -House. -Can I come in? -Please. It's very nice. Nice, big. Do you like it big? Alan. Happy new home. Sometimes you have to take chances. You think so? He is... It's an honor to meet you. I want you to know I'm a big fan, even before HD. Yeah. You are always, and I mean always, on my mind. Nice to meet you, sir. -He's my father. -I know. Alan, Alan, Alan! -Whatever you need... -Dad. Okay, the bar goes there. The DJ over there. The guy with the LEDS. It's going to be a big party. Is it the last one? Oh, boss, the drought has killed the crop. Nothing has grown anymore. If there's no reward in the life we live, every winter night will be rough. But there's a prize. There's a prize even when we lose. You can have this and you can eat it raw. THE LAST PARTY THE LAST PARTY
