Too many variations of shit. - That's a Fender amp. - Mm hmm. I wouldn't recognize that one, Bassbreaker 45. I have a good question for you, though. In the 80s it was... we said "Rickenbacher". - You guys all say Rickenbacker. - "Rickenbacker" - It's "backer". - Yeah. We already had a small debate earlier. We were from the South. - It's "backer", yeah. - I think so. There's no "bachers." No. Is that one yours, Jakob? No, we used this one on the record, though. - This is Andy's. - Yeah, that's Andy's. - Want to have a look? - Bring it over here. This was the folk rock special.

It's where a lot of musicians lived. But they came to L.A. from everywhere. They came from England and from all overAmerica. And probably because of the record companies in L.A. They had to come to L.A. and this was the one place that you could live and it was the antithesis of this sort of plastic, straight world that you saw on television. To be that close to the Sunset Strip and yet you had a feel that you were in the country and, you know, and totally different feel. It's beautiful. ♪ There you stood on ♪ ♪ The edge of your feather ♪ ♪ Expecting to fly ♪ I think I might have been the first one to move there. I was living in one place, some... some place way up the canyon. There was a lot of camaraderie in the bands. We got to know Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys and, of course, The Mamas & Papas when they came along. I'd known John and Michelle from New York and Mama Cass was great, a great social hostess. Laurel Canyon was always like a hangout for, ah, bohemians and actors. It was full of charming little houses and it was a very joyful time. I loved it, because I've always loved eccentricity. I mean I'm attracted to eccentrics and they were there. And they were all there. Everyone was writing and writing together. And you'd go over to someone's house and you always brought your guitar and you'd sit around and you'd start playing, and pretty soon you were writing a hit. People would not even call. They'd just knock on the door and go "Listen, hey, listen to this!" That's an incredible environment for a musician to be in because it's incredibly healthy and incredibly forward-looking and incredibly creative and that's how I was feeling. There was so much great music floating around that you got little snippets of it and they... they just filtered through you, you know? Good evening. The great Los Angeles songwriter Warren Zevon once said that... I miss him every day. He said if Roger McGuinn had just played the opening notes to The Byrds' debut album and dropped dead, he would have still exercised the most pronounced influence over the folk rock movement in 25 years. And he was right. Because in 1965 when those songs went on the radio, it was the first time a song of poetic depth and grace had become a hit song and it inspired a whole generation of writers to write differently and to come to California, which gave birth to the Laurel Canyon scene. So, the fiftieth anniversary of that moment was this summer. So Jakob and I decided, 'cause nobody else was doing anything, that we would make a record of those songwriters. So now we're doing a show and you're all a part of it. And thanks for coming and enjoy the show! You guys ready to go to the 60s? This is so great because the music that came out of the Laurel Canyon scene in the 60s was not only inspiring to other bands at that time, but it also became inspiring to my generation of musicians and songwriters. And tonight is an opportunity, like folk music, to pass it on to a new generation and keep the echoes of that music growing. ♪ Oh, the summer time is coming ♪ ♪ And the leaves are sweetly turning ♪ ♪ And the wild mountain thyme ♪ ♪ Blooms across the purple heather ♪ ♪ Will you go... ♪ - Can we start over? - I think I know it. We ready? I was gonna for a harmony but then I... What is the refrain, though? Is it... just "will you go"? I like the way you're doing it. I just go "Will you go, will you go?" Sorry. Well, we can do it again. I think the refrain just comes around again. We just... these just kind of repeat. Oh, we never... what is all this? I never saw any of this! ♪ Oh, the summer time is coming... ♪ Why did we start all this? Well, we'd seen this movie "Model Shop". It reminded us of a lot of music from the 60s so we decided to go back and record some of the songs from the mid-60s and we got more and more curious on what brought everybody here. Who came out here first? Was it people from the east coast coming out here? Or was it people here that started it just independently? Beach Boys were already here. I think The Byrds came out first and everybody else followed. And how did The Byrds come to be? It started so innocently. ♪ Oh yeah I'll tell you somethin' ♪ ♪ I think you'll understand ♪ The Beatles came out. And I heard this on the radio... And I said wow, you know, they're using folk music chord changes, all these passing chords. So, it gave me an idea of taking an old folk song and suping it up with a Beatle beat. And I took it down to the village and played it at the Café Playhouse. And they didn't like it. They didn't like the rock 'n' roll and folk music combined. They thought it was kind of a bad idea. You know, the coolest thing about Roger, and I... it was like the first day I met him, he came into the Playhouse Café with a Gibson 12-string, and he plays "I Wanna Hold Your Hand". Hmm. And I went "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" as a one guitar folk thing? And it was really a remarkable, ballsy thing. - And he did take abuse for it. - Yeah. I know a lot of people were going what's he doing? So I went out to L.A. and I got gig at the Troubadour opening up for Hoyt Axton doing the same thing. And they didn't like it there, either. And that's when I got together with Gene Clark and David Crosby and we got The Byrds together. There was a lot of funny shit that happened. Ah, we were rehearsing in an old recording studio down on Third Avenue, ah, World Pacific I think it was called. Used to be a jazz studio. After they were through using the studio at night, we would go in there and rehearse. And it did The Byrds a great deal of good because we would have to listen to it back. If you hear how awful you are then you work harder! Mm hmm. And so, that's exactly what we did. And then, after we started getting good with it, ah, Dylan showed up. You have to be more specific. No, I'm kidding! You mean there's more than one? Yeah! - Bob showed up. - Okay. And he, 'cause he had heard we were doing "Tambourine Man". He listened to us play it electric and he you can hear the gears turning, you know. He knew he wanted to do that immediately. With The Byrds the real accomplishment is the melding of, you know, folk music and rock 'n' roll and I mean all the bands you think of that as that California sound. Really none of them sound exactly like The Byrds. ♪ The reasons why ♪ That 12-string riff is pretty spectacular. That's a pretty big moment in rock music. That's really, you know, two things clashing together in a huge wave. And it would create a whole genre of music quickly. I loved the sound that McGuinn got out of the 12-string and I thought that the way he placed that, and Crosby's rhythm, you know, underpinning it, they were the powerful band that we all wanted to be! I liked The Byrds a lot and I liked their kind of philosophy, the musical philosophy, really, of, you know, folk rock. Folk rock to me was... it was the songwriting, too. - Yeah, it was good. - It was beautiful. ♪ Oh, what will you give me? ♪ Sang the sad bells of Rhymney ♪ Folk music is just an older form of songwriting. You learn a song from somebody, maybe it was your uncle or somebody who learned it from a knife sharpener who traveled through the South sharpening knives and scissors who also played banjo and fiddle. When The Byrds came out, there were people who disapproved of doing those folk songs with a band. But it was very infectious. That's a big step forward from "Love Me Do" to any of those things. And we started to take rock 'n' roll seriously, 'cause, yeah, no one took it seriously before that. We were putting good poetry on the radio, AM radio, pop radio. It was the first time. There wasn't any of that before. It was June, Moon, Spoon. ♪ Baby I love you Ooh, ooh ♪ Wasn't "Dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free." It changed everything for everybody. Yeah.

And they said The Byrds! And we were just blown away. We kind of dressed like 'em. In fact, we bought these suits that had black velvet collars. And we used to wear them to Ciro's every night while we were doing our gig. That worked for about a week. We'd hang them up in the dressing room and put back our t-shirts and jeans and go home. Well, one night we got to Ciro's and the suits were gone. And I told this to John Lennon. He said, "I wished they'd stolen our suits." ♪ Every time I see you smile ♪ ♪ Come to me, don't be long ♪ ♪ Let me tell you how my heart goes wild ♪ ♪ Please let me love you and it won't be wrong ♪ We were invited to go to England and we were really jazzed because this is where The Beatles and The Stones were. Then we got there and we discovered we'd been billed as America's answer to The Beatles. And it was a little tough to live up to. And they came to see us one night at the Blaises Club and Chris was so nervous he broke a bass string. And nobody ever breaks a bass string, but he did. Then we went upstairs after the show and John and George came up and John said "Great show!" you know. They loved us. They were really nice to us. When we came over there finally, they were extremely cool. Who is the young man with the lengthy haircut to your right rear? Who is it? That's Dave from The Byrds, a mate of ours. And then the next night we went to the Scotch at St. James and Paul McCartney, this is his private club. And we had a couple of drinks, and he took me for a ride in his Aston Martin DB5 around London. And then we hung out at The Stones' house and they showed us how they rolled joints. And they had a butler that rolled joints and put them on the stairs for them in the morning like the morning coffee! Yeah. The Byrds were great. They just became our friends. I mean when we came to L.A., they came and hung out with us, you know. That 12-string sound was great and the voices were great. So we loved The Byrds. They introduced us to a hallucinogenic situation. Hmm. And, ah, we had a really good time. The Beatles actually started the folk rock in California. It was... and it probably was the California guys trying to grab hold of that sound. It's all full of strange coincidences. John Hall of the Rickenbacker company flying to New York because he'd heard The Beatles played Rickenbacker and going up to the suite with the second Rickenbacker 12-string ever made, giving it to George. He brought it for John because he's the one that played the Rickenbacker. But George had the flu, the other three had gone out for a photo session, and George nabbed the 12-string. Mm hmm. That changed pop music, you know, rock music I guess you would call it. We should have the nerve to call it rock music, I mean it was rock 'n' roll music. Everything was influencing everything. With this huge witches brew of, you know, and things would pop out. I mean and transatlantic, too, 'cause we were all listening to each other's records, you know. And The Beatles were doing their cop on The Byrds with one song and then they were doing The Beach Boys with "Girl", you know. ♪ I wish they all could be California girls ♪ I was a sucker for Brian's work right away. I was very close friends with Felix Pappalardi and he was the guy who pointed out to me the Bach-like qualities. And he said listen to this chord sequence. They're using like Bach chordal movements in there. I mean that was really important. ♪ Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the States ♪ ♪ Back to the cutest girls in the world ♪ ♪ I wish they all could be California girls ♪ Well, they were the other band that we admired. They were it. Everybody else... and they were as establishment as they could be, but they were good. They had good songs 'cause of Brian and they had really interesting harmonies, completely different than anybody else. So, we liked them a lot. May I have, I'm sure most everybody knows but for anybody who might not, may be introduce you by name? - Al Jardine. - Thank you, Al. - Dennis Wilson. - Thank you. - Brian Wilson. - Carl Wilson. Mike Love. Who determines what will be done next? Well, I guess I do. I don't know. I write the songs and produce them, so I have a lot to say about it. I can't see something in Mozart that's better than Brian Wilson. I think you could make that case. Those guys would have loved him. Hmm. He's really just too good. He's Yeah. He's not a guy that comes down the pike in many lifetimes.

Beach Boys was a primary thing when Cream was kind of philosophically driven by it, by the idea that we could somehow do something like that. Or be inspired by that, Pet Sounds, you know. They lived right down the street from us, Brian and Marilyn. And one day I went over there and the whole living room was full of sand. And there was nothing in the living room but a Steinway and a piano bench and just all sand. And I looked at her and I said what is going on? She said I know it's crazy but he's writing some great songs. Mm hmm. And he was writing Pet Sounds! I won that record on the radio, ah, on a call-in! Like I was standing by the phone and some trivia question was asked. I called right away and answered it and I won a record! And it was Pet Sounds. It took me a few spins to understand, like, what's going on here. But I just fell in love with that record. It's different. You know, it's off in a corner by itself. Nobody else did that successfully, not to the level they did 'cause they didn't have a writer like Brian. I was just kind of maybe too young to really appreciate how incredibly sophisticated the music was. I just saw five guys wearing the same shirt holding one surfboard and I thought it was lame. Hmm. But all that changed when I heard Pet Sounds. That's said to be responsible for Sgt. Pepper, you know, totally.

Okay, cool. Well, Bach influenced "California Girls", the duh, duh-duh, duh-duh, that kind of a beat, shuffle rhythm. Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen taught me harmony and Chuck Berry taught me rock 'n' roll melodies. Well, I learned violin arrangement from George Martin. I learned how to make... write out, you know, violin for violin players. I wrote manuscript for them, and they played it... if they played it wrong I can walk out and go "You got it wrong, buddy. You gotta do this right", you know, and they'd fix their instruments and they'd do it. Hmm. Well, The Beatles were probably my favorite group, you know. I really liked them a lot. With Rubber Soul, one of my buddies brought it over and played it for me. I said I can't believe this album! You know? He kept playing it and playing it and I said wow! I couldn't believe it.

So, we've got to get back to L.A. But we were staying at the Albert Hotel. That's where all the musicians kind of stayed when they went into town. And since John and I had gotten married, I wanted to go back home. And he said we can't go back home. We can't. The music business is here in New York. That's when he woke me up in the middle of the night and he said I'm writing a song. Listen to this.

I was just saying that this is where we first sang for Lou Adler, in this studio. In this room, too? We recorded in 3, but this is where we, just where we're standing right now, we sang practically the first album for Lou. And what were some of the songs you sang in the audition that you had? "California Dreamin'", "Monday Monday", "Go Where You Wanna Go." - You had some good ones, then. - You know. - Wow. - We had some material. And he said, with his hat pulled down over his nose like this, you know, "Why don't you guys come back tomorrow. We'll talk about this tomorrow." "Okay." And when we came back, the contracts were all over the floor at Studio 3 and they were handing out pens like here! Sign this! Sign this! Sign this! Well, then the audition went well, obviously. It did! I think the first studio I recorded in, that's all the equipment they had, just this little slab here. The piano was in the middle. Hal Blaine and his drums were there. John Phillips and his 12-string, P. F. Sloan, maybe Glen Campbell, Billy Strange, one of those guitar players... - All in here. - would be in a line. We were at the end of a take and Denny Doherty... it was pretty wild through the night. It got wilder and wilder. A lot of Crown Royal bags laying everything. And Denny had fallen asleep on the piano. And John said "Denny, get up. I need a note." And we couldn't raise Denny. So, we put... got a microphone and pulled it over here. Hmm. And put it over Denny like that. And John leaned down and sang the note to him. Denny sang the note, he got the note he wanted, he went right back to sleep. But it's a fantastic room. I mean it's...

You see something in a band member, their talent and their sexiness, and there's a spark. I know that it happened in the The Mamas & the Papas. I've seen it happen in almost any group that I can think of that have men and women in them. Jefferson Airplane, Fleetwood Mac. We were so confined to the four of us living together all the time. We were always together. And when we were rehearsing, Denny and I under the table were playing footsie. And Denny was also a big flirt. He just wanted to take it to the maximum, you know.

And that's when Denny just got up and he walked over to the sliding glass door and off we went. I was raised in a very free atmosphere. To me, having an affair was not as serious as it was to the rest of them. I had had an affair before Denny when John and I had first gotten married. So, it was something that John had already experienced with me, and that's when he wrote "Go Where You Wanna Go". John was really crushed and upset about it and so the lyric of "go where you want to go, do what you want to do, with whoever you want to do it with" bitch! So, I mean, I was busy.

Music happens at a particular moment in time and it changes everything going forward. ♪ You're going to lose that girl ♪ I had ended up with an acetate of Pet Sounds and I was going to England to visit my friend Andrew Oldham, who is a producer of The Rolling Stones. And Paul McCartney came by and I played them Pet Sounds and they were listening to everything that Brian was doing and thinking about how they could use certain things that he was doing on Pet Sounds. Out of that comes Sgt. Pepper. There was a lot of stuff going on. All those records you bought, those vinyl... we bought, you weren't even born... were just the best. 'Cause everyone was at it. I have two favorite records, as a lot of people do, and one of them is Pet Sounds and the other is Sgt. Pepper. You can listen to the records and you can see the cross-pollinization. It was a magical thing. Any time something good happens, it's gonna show up other places. It's gonna be mirrored back. Well, that was just like cross-pollinization. I mean The Beatles also grew up listening to skiffle music. George admits "The Bells of Rhymney" and "If I Needed Someone" are very similar. I think he sent Roger a little card about it that he still has, you know. Someone would have written most of a song, say, you know, Paul or John, and they play it and when it felt good okay, that's how we do it. We would just jam. We were buskers. The riff was... ♪ Oh, what will you give me? ♪ ♪ Say the sad bells of Rhomey ♪ Anyway, so George liked that riff and he wrote: ♪ If I needed someone to love ♪ based on that. He made a tape of it and gave it to Derek Taylor in London. Derek came over to my house, he said George wants you to know that he wrote this song based on your riff in "Bells of Rhymney". When you hear beautiful music it gets inside you and sometimes you want to do a little something like that maybe, but your way. Or wow, he did that so maybe I could maybe... and it's an open-ended thing. But that's fair, right? That's... that's fair. But, you know, outright theft isn't that good but you... But in that sense I thought it was really nice. You have the heavy... you're a little bit on the heavier side. You got the Pet Sounds and the Sgt. Pepper's over there... I have some very good shit over here, yeah! I'll stick with this. Yeah. And these records come all of a sudden like an avalanche. Mm hmm. And there's nothing like them before. It used to be that every time any of these came out it was like this giant event and people would talk about it and gather together and put on a record in their room and listen to the record. - It's so cool. - For days. For days! And they'd be deciphering, you know, why is he wearing this cape, poncho, from the Renaissance Fair. Yeah, one of my favorite things about all these bands is that they're, in a sense, they're sort of super groups, you know. They have multiple lead singers. They have multiple songwriters. But I think the beauty of all this is how they came together and brought the best of that they had for something. Yeah! I mean just listen to Buffalo Springfield - and all those bands. - Yeah. You just get something completely remarkable and unique - when it's... - Oh, yeah... A combination, a collaborative, that you can't... you just can't do, with all your own DNA. You just can't. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Nice to see you all! Welcome. Would you be kind enough to act as spokesman, introduce yourself, and then let us know who else is involved. Ah, my name is Neil Young. All right, Neil. How do you do? I'm the lead guitar player. How do you do? This is Richie Furay. Hello, Richie! Nice to see you - This is Steve Stills. - Hello, Steve. Nice to see you. How does three Canadians and a couple of other fellows all fall into together? How did that happen? Well, we, ah, Bruce and I came to Los Angeles in an old hearse to try to, you know, make stars, you know. We're gonna be stars.

It was Neil with a little trio called The Squires. And he was doing exactly what I wanted to do, which was to play folk songs on electric guitar. And we hung out together for a week. We talked and dreamt and fantasized about what we wanted to do. And we were inseparable. Buffalo Springfield, you know, that was a big one. I saw them back in '67 or '68. They came to Gainesville and played with The Beach Boys. You know, I never got over it! It was a really mind-blowing show, you know. It was like that's as good as it's supposed to be, you know. It was maybe better. Buffalo Springfield had like, you know, just like legions of the girls that, you know, I wanted, you know, were like just looking that way. And I thought, you know, this is... this must be a pretty good band. - We went to L.A. with Cream. - Yeah. And I hadn't been there more than about an hour and there was a knock at the door and then Stephen Stills was there with a guitar, you know. He just came in. I took his guitar out of the case and said "I hear you like this". - He played you "Bluebird"? - He played "Bluebird". They'd end with this really long "Bluebird", like, you know, trading guitars for... 'til it just got really intense. It was great. The Byrds picked up the Buffalo Springfield for an opening act and it lasted until David Crosby saw us for the first time and he says "Get them out of there. They're too good." I remember thinking when we did it this is a bad idea. 'Cause they're - they're really amazingly good. And we had hits, you know, so we could follow them, but they were awfully goddamn good. What was good about it is that we had a wealth of material. What was bad about it, it was in really divergent directions. The first song we had, "Clancy", with the Buffalo Springfield, we did the first take and the voice comes back from the booth and said, "It's too long. Play it faster." Mm hmm. And that's when Neil and I looked at each other and said oh my God, we've gotta learn how to do this ourselves. There's Neil and I'm listening to something that he's doing. And that's the old original console. This was only 8-track. That's why it's an old Altec console with like big knobs. And right after that, I think we got an MCI or something and went to 16, which to me was all we ever needed. But this is like after we obviously had learned to make them ourselves. I see, no... That's probably the engineer that was hired for the session. He's gotta sit down now?

Well, to start with I had this what... you know those magical days where a lot of stuff happens? I met Judy Collins and Eric Clapton on the same night. I went to the Whisky to see Eric. And so I'm flirting with Judy, trying to listen to Eric, who's blowing my mind, and so I'm overwhelmed. And then later on, Crosby had brought Eric to my little house in Laurel Canyon. And the changes to "Questions" were derived from a song of Judy's called "Since You've Asked". And I just took this first three chords and changed the cadence and everything. And then it evolved into the song. And I think I was playing it for him as I was trying to write it, and it later ended up on a Buffalo Springfield album. I haven't listened to that stuff for a long time, you know, the west coast music, at all and so... The original version you... No, I haven't heard the original version of "Questions" for a long, long, long time. And it really took me back. ♪ What was it made you run ♪ ♪ Tryin' to get around The questions... ♪ It took me back to a song that I had done, too, around the same time. Ah, a little later, actually, called "Let It Rain". And it was one of the first songs I'd ever written. And it... and there, you know, there's that kind of... I was influenced by it, I think. Yeah, I thought that we talked about having, hopefully, you play on that song with Stephen... Yeah. I wondered if that was gonna be... it's not gonna bother you that there's the... there's a similar feel or... Well I didn't... I must have copped it and not even known, you know. We can edit that part right out. Well, no, no! I think, no, that's very important for people to know. Well Stephen owes you one. ♪ Come on lover, talk to me ♪ Sorry I got lost. Whatever happened in the solo section was great. - Cool. - With you and Eric together. Yeah. When Eric's playing in the top of the second solo, you know, he's playing in the higher register and I think anything in the lower register would be cool as a complement. ♪ Where are we going love? ♪ Eric was very meticulous about reminding me back then, he said You know, when you're doing this on stage, you must take turns. Much like schoolyard, you know. Gentlemanly. I had got an invite to go and watch Buffalo Springfield rehearsing in a house in Laurel Canyon. I had met this girl called Mary Hughes who was the kind of beauty queen of the Strip at that time. Jeff Beck was dating her and Keith Moon was dating her and I somehow managed to get into the equation. And I'm with this beautiful girl and there's joints being passed around and they start to play. And they played at a level where it wasn't too loud for everybody and they were rehearsing a set, I think, to play for a show. And then there's a knock at the door. And someone goes to answer and there's an immediate vibe in the room of that something's wrong, you know. And they open the door and there's a policeman standing there. And there's a squad car in the background. And he says, "You'll have to keep it down. We've had some complaints about the noise. What's that?" And next thing you know, they're in the room. And I had nothing... I had just put down a joint. I had nothing in my hands, but, ah, I was handcuffed to somebody. So, we were all taken to L.A. County Jail. Meanwhile, it was like where's... what happened to Stephen? Stephen, when he realized who was at the front door... Yeah! Jumped out the bathroom window and ran off. There's a party that we heard about, too, your... was it your house that had a party in the Canyon? Is that the same party you mentioned? What? Disastrous. What I heard was you were there, Eric was there, Neil was there, and so were the police. - I'd say yeah! - That sound right? Neil and I were sitting in a bedroom in the back and we here this. And I said go check that. I'm gonna go next door and call lawyers! And I book it out the back. So, of course, that blew up into ruining my reputation. Oh, he was the guy that booked, you know. And, ah, and I went next door and... totally reprehensible. I should have manned up and... and it wasn't. I've never lived that down and felt awful about it ever since. Neil got really aggressive and was out the door and he was gonna go chase the police away. 'Cause he's Canadian and I guess in Canada you can do that... It was really exciting to get to Los Angeles coming from Gainesville, Florida. And in my mind, it was the weather and the girls and the surfing and the cars and it was a young mentality. This is kind of where people that really were big dreamers went to because that's kind of allowed here. There are people that believe that it might be possible to do something that's not ordinary. The first thing I remember going down Sunset Boulevard looking out the car at the all the record companies, you know. In those days it was MGM, you know, Capitol, you know, all these labels that aren't there anymore. It was true. I got out there and man, these recording studios are all spotless and engineers are really remarkably good. This is where Phil Spector and Brian Wilson were working. People started showing up here trying to work with the engineers they worked with and the studios that they worked in to make things sound... fat. In America it's very, very different. Abbey Road was the only place that, basically, we ever recorded, right. There it was almost like, ah, almost like the BBC. All the engineers had these white overalls on. And, you know, if you wanted to bring the bass up you had to go to the producer who then went to the engineer who then brought the bass up. You were secondary somehow to these people in white coats that were really making the music. They had all these like professors guys. You know, scientists upstairs. We were in the studio. It's like an old 40s movie. Oh, what's that you want? You want to play? Mm, let me see what I can do. Very different here. Very much looser, much better. "Good Vibrations" was recorded in four studios, four different studios. Well, each studio is different, you know? Like you can't... not any one studio's the same. Western was good for the, ah, instrumentation, like the bass, the drums, guitars. Sunset Sound, I liked their tech piano. I used that on the bridge to "Good Vibrations." Gold Star was good for just the echo. The echo of Gold Star was good. And RCA Victor, that's where we did the vocal. There were so many studios. They had that great RCA studio on Sunset and Ivar. It was a fantastic place. Columbia Studios. And Western, you know, United Western at times it was called. It's still there. Have you... have you recorded here? No, I've never been here. Yeah, this is where Brian Wilson, Mamas & the Papas, and Buffalo Springfield recorded. Yeah? As well as you can see the evolution of Don Was. Yeah, there he is! And let's go back further. And there's some more of him over there. Yeah, you can here see this... There's some more him down there - ...before he really figured it out. What about these guys? Mm, not really familiar. - That's okay. - It's okay. - This is all right here, huh? - Yeah. It's cool. Yeah, I want to record a song by The Association. Yeah!

It was fantastic. I suddenly felt exhilarated there. I was really moved by the geometry of the place, its harmony. It's a fabulous city. To think some people claim it's an ugly city when it's really pure poetry, it just kills me. I wanted to build something right then, create something. I used to love L.A. when I was first there in the early 60s. You can drive around and smell the orange blossoms, you know. It was really cool. We moved into Laurel Canyon and we just loved the scene there. And a lot of people, a lot of folk singers would come around and play and we'd, you know, get high and stuff. It was fan... a fun time. Just driving up those canyons and people pointing out houses of famous people that lived there, Houdini and Tom Mix and Zappa and, you know, it was a fabulous time. ♪ I need somebody groovy ♪ ♪ Someone who's able to move me, yeah ♪ Any time you drove by the Canyon Store you saw some pop hero. There's David Crosby, you know! There were people from everywhere in Laurel Canyon. In '66 it was teeming. And you might see anybody. Like I one time saw Crosby blow through there and scoop up these two girls. And he was wearing a cape, by the way. Disappeared, you know, into the night! Frank Zappa lived across the street. And he once stood in the middle of the street reading me the lyrics of "Who Are The Brain Police", like Alan Ginsberg. It was... And I kept going whoa! Whoa! Whoa! And then I heard Frank Zappa do an orchestration on a track without the yelling over it. And it was... it was otherworldly. It was really... really incredible. There's not the kind of scene there is in New York and the east coast cities where there's a club you go to. We would go over to people's houses and yak it up for hours and hours! And play music, you know. All kinds of music all the time. I wrote a song with Brian Wilson one time. Brian came over to my house. I said wow. He had never come over before. And he came up and he said, "You got any speed?" And I said, "I think so." I went to the medicine cabinet and I gave him two Biphetamine 20s. He... he wanted two. And this is about, mm, 4:00 in the afternoon. We started playing a song. It was like a... Okay, we're playing that and we're playing that and playing that. And it finally gets dark and I go to bed. And, you know, seven, eight hours later I got up and Brian is still at the piano going... - Still playing the same figure? - Yeah, same song, yeah! - Really fast. - It's only got one verse. And they finally released it, called it "Ding Dang". And whenever I see Brian these days he points at me and goes "Ding dang!" There's a lot of strange stuff happening here. George and I just drove up to wherever Micky Dolenz lived and Stephen Stills was there and several other people. And they were all being hippies in the nude. And when they saw it was George and I driving they all run in and got dressed! And we were going well, that's not very hippie. You just felt like you could do anything, you know. You just felt like there was nothing stopping you, is the way that... and Hollywood was right there and the music industry, or a good part of it. And Sunset Boulevard, you know. It just... it reeked of what happened in the 40s with the movie stars and that lifestyle. And, in a sense, we emulated it in a different way. There's a certain thing about freedom of spirit, a certain thing about lack of rules, lack of previous stuff holding you in place. Certain people wound up, you know, in certain places and chemistries happened and they inspired other chemistries around them. I kind of compare it with Vienna at the turn of the century when all those architects and painters and furniture builders would drink massive amounts of coffee, and what are you doing and what are you working on now? Paris in the 30s with Gertrude Stein and all, you know, all those artists coming together. But I think this era, in time, is gonna be treated exactly the same way in a couple of hundred years by the historians. The power of music is undeniable. I truly believe it can change the world.

And we decided to do a Goffin and King song called "Going Back" and he was just up in arms about that. It just wasn't, you know, something that they thought was in good taste, you know. It was risqué, it was out on the edge, you know. To me it's not out on the edge at all. It's just a love song. It has happened. I mean otherwise the French wouldn't have a name for it! It wasn't so much David writing the song. It was the realization that he actually lived it, many times. That was what pissed me off. He knows it was a naughty song to write. You gotta remember, Crosby was like Brando. He had no boundaries. Carole and Gerry had moved from New York to L.A. and they had starting writing songs that... not the kind of girl band stuff they'd been doing. But more of like a hipper style. And David was... he was, um, insufferable. He was tough to live with. He didn't get his cool song on and we did this kind of really commercial song instead. So, he was angry with that. The breaking point really was when Chris Hillman got mad at David and said we gotta get rid of him. The fun thing is that everybody thinks that that's why they threw me out of The Byrds. Ladies and gentlemen, They threw me out of The Byrds 'cause I was an asshole. He was saying things like you guys are not good enough musicians to be playing with me. I went oh, really? - That's not cool, you know! - Yeah. So, we didn't like that attitude very much. You know, I say it's because I was an asshole. It wasn't that simple, of course. If you give kids millions of dollars, you know, they'll screw up. We held it together for a pretty long time. Bands tend to devolve. They evolve up the point where they're exciting and they're new and they're good, and then after that they work their way slowly downhill until it's turn on the smoke machine and play your hits. And that's not good enough for me. It's just not. I've done it. You know, 'cause it was the path of least resistance and it made me lots of money and all that good stuff.

Can you talk a little about that? It really started with, ah, seeing this film, which was "Model Shop". And it was a movie in '67 done by Jacques Demy. That movie looked like the sound of The Beach Boys and The Mamas & Papas. And so, it sent us on an exploration back to that time and to look at the records that, you know, made, ah, made that age of innocence of southern California writing from '65 to '67, you know, come alive. Most of the groups that we're talking about, that we've picked from, I think they were... those are the ones that are the premier southern California rock bands from that year at that time. Something happened there that engendered a whole lot of music, a whole lot of new ways of approaching the music possible. Whatever it was, it was a good thing. I don't think you have to put too much effort into it, really. I think they're classics. They're timeless. And a good song will sound as good then as it'll sound today. You don't have to do much. We didn't reinvent them at all. We actually stayed pretty true to what they sounded like. And oddly enough, that sound is pretty relevant. It's pretty current right now. I think, you know, people have been trying to put salt on its tail for a long time, trying to figure out why it happened there and how it happened there. And I... you can guess and you can point out certain factors that you think would have been influencing it. But I don't know if we'll ever get it named. It did happen. And it still is a place where people come to make music. Maybe it started with this optimism of The Beatles to Ed Sullivan was the beginning of '64, so that is the perfect kickoff where there's this fad, right? People want to be their own Beatles. And then so that lasts for two, two and a half years. Well, it probably changed a lot when everybody started writing more complex, longer songs, which is kind of up until Pet Sounds and Expecting to Fly. Songs were three and a half minutes and they could do... they realized they could do a lot more. Don't you feel like some of these songs structurally, like word-wise and sound-wise, they're almost like more related to dreams? Because they feel like music before was more written for like the conscious mind and this seems to be like more coming in touch with the subconscious, which is on the way to psychedelia probably, just that in-between? Well I think we talked about "Expecting To Fly" and maybe that's the end of it? You know? I'm not sure I would be the one to say why it's the end of it, but that's very different than everything else we listened to and I wouldn't say more ambitious, but it seemed like something cracked open maybe right then. That era begins with this collective idea of these musicians and this creative force coming together to make something bigger. And then the era ends when it becomes more about the individual, yeah, searching their own life and their own path and, ah, yeah, you get all these groups breaking up. When you have strong minded people and they're having these visions of a new type of art and they start to compromise, then it just doesn't last maybe. What do you remember about "Expecting To Fly"? 'Cause we recorded that for the record. What do you remember about recording that song? Actually, I wasn't allowed on those sessions. You're not on that at all? No, that's when Neil had decided to take flight. - That song was a warning. - Was it? - Yes, I'm leaving. - Really? And I'm going to wait until it's absolutely critically important to the survival of the band, like the night before Johnny Carson booked the first rock band.
