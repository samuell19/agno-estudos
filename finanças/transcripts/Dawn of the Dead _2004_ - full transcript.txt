We'll be teeing off at 7:30. If you're not there because of Gary, come on. I gotta go. Am I missing something? Why did Dr. Cho order a head X-ray when the man was bitten on the head? Uh, the patient was in a bar fight. He was communicative when he was admitted at 6:00. That's 6:00am. This morning, that's when I started my shift. Where is the patient now? I'd like to see him. They moved him. One of the night nurses can... - Page me when you find him. - Sure. I'll do that. [woman speaking over loudspeaker] Cora, can you do me a favor - and locate a patient for me? - Hey, Ana. Sure. - Edward Solomon? - Yep. [tapping keys] Aren't you off? - An hour ago. - [both chuckle] Here he is. They had him backwards. Solomon Edward. He's upstairs in ICU. - From a bite? - I don't know what from. Toxicology's gonna work him up in the morning. I'm gonna get out of here. Can you page Dr. Dandewarr and let him know? - Sure. - Thanks. Did you talk to Luis about Sunday? - I will.

I'm trading shifts with Cora so if I take Sunday, I can have a three-day weekend at the end of the month. - Sunday? Yeah. - Is that okay? Yeah.

You do not want to go that way. What's that way? Officer, sir? You do not want to go that way. What's that way? It's pretty bad. What about Fort Pastor? Maybe if you had wings. The road's thick with those motherfuckers. How do you know? We just tried. Come on. Back when there was eight of us. We're going to the mall. Shit. [Muzak playing] We need to make sure this place is safe. I'm gonna see if the doors over this way are locked. I'll check down there. Maybe, Officer, you could go down that direction, check for...

Find someplace else. - Look, we just need a place... - [cocks gun] Maybe you didn't hear me. There is no place else. Well, it's tough shit, 'cause this is our place and you can't stay here. Yeah. And you already trashed Metropolis. Look, dumbass, my wife is pregnant. - [elevator bell dings] - We can't run anymore. - His arm... - Those things are down there. Well, these are all your problems, not mine. If I put my foot up your ass, would that be your problem? Hey, asshole, I'm the one pointing the gun at you. He is a cop, CJ. - [elevator bell dings] - So what? [elevator buzzer rings] [Ana] We're not gonna cause any trouble. Just let us stay here for a little while. Please. Okay. Come out of there slowly and give your weapons - to Bart and Terry. - Don't do it. You must be out of your fucking mind. You can take your ass on over to Quality Inn, if it's still there, Shaq. Huh? You want to do that? Let's go. Hey, don't give him that gun. [Andre] Fuck. Fuck. Smart move. [man speaking over TV] ...everywhere. Nobody seems to know what's going on. There's a lot of blood and there are bodies. There's a slew of fires. We're back to a live picture now. [indistinct chatter on TV] Give me one second here. Ma'am, are you American? All right. Let's go, guys. Come on. Get your own little TV. Come on. Let's go. Excuse me. Please. Is there a restroom? No. You're staying here. Then why don't you tell us which spot in here you'd like us to take a piss. All right. It's around the corner, that way. Whoa, whoa, whoa, where do you think you're going? She's not going anywhere alone. "She's not going anywhere..." This is a fucking nursery school! Terry, go with them. Hi, I'm Bill Vibert with 23V Cable News. I'm at one of the collection depots waiting to interview Sheriff Cahill. I understand you're having a difficult time killing these things... Just shoot 'em in the head. They seem to go down permanently when you shoot 'em in the head. Then you gotta burn them. You gotta burn... Danny! Danny! Put another round in that woman over there! Look! She's a twitcher! - [dog barking on TV] - Twitcher. Now, that is one cool motherfucker. Bleeding's not gonna stop on its own. I need to stitch his arm. You a fucking doctor? No, I'm a fucking nurse. I know some of these people that we're putting down. First aid kit's in the security office. What are you gonna do? It's gotta be done. Huh? What did I tell you boys? [sheriff] Get those bodies off the truck! We haven't got all day here. America always sorts its shit out. You know, you're lucky. He could have bitten it off. Yes, I believe you're referring to a report that came in this morning. That report was completely... [reporter] What can we tell the people out there that don't know what to do? [man] What I would suggest is that you come to Fort Pastor. If you can't make it here, we have multiple search-and-rescue teams out there and they will find you. My brother's there. He's waiting for me. [crying] - [door bangs open] - What's the holdup, darling? Hm? [Michael] So what's the plan? The plan is you drink a tall glass of shut-the-fuck-up. - [Kenneth groans] - [Michael] OK. That's one idea. What about locking this place down? Sooner or later, they're gonna get in here. Mm. That's good. Like I hadn't thought of that. Okay, no doubt. You probably already thought about putting a sign up on the roof. 'Cause, you know, there's still planes in the air. Might be good to let them know we're alive. We can get some paint from Case Hardware. Use some office doors to board up the weak spots. That's a solid plan. CJ, is it? - Yeah. - All right, CJ. [clears throat] All right, everybody listen up. I'm gonna give everybody a job to do and I expect you to do all of it. I don't want to see any half-assin'. Why don't you can start by cleaning up that mess you made in Metropolis. Hey, CJ, look! Terry. Take a look at Ben Cozine. Hey, Ben. Ben! Christ. Look at him. [Ben screeching] [Bart] Look, he's a twitcher. TV says you gotta shoot 'em in the head. TV said a lot of things that aren't true. Well, fuck the fucker. I told him not to go downstairs. [Ben screeches] Let's go. Let's get to work. [whispering] Holy shit. [growling] [echoing gunfire] [man 1] Let's do it. [man 2] All right, let's pick him up, then. All right. Ready? One, two, three. [groans] [man 1] One two, all right? [both] One, two. - [thud] - [distant growling] What are they? I don't know. Why are they coming here? [Kenneth] Memory, maybe. Instinct. Maybe they're coming for us. [echoing gunfire] - [distant growling] - [gunfire] [Ana] Look over there. There's someone on the roof. [CJ] Yeah, his name's Andy. He's alone. He may as well be on the moon. [Ana] Poor guy. What's he pointing at? [helicopter approaching] - Helicopter. - Hey, it's coming. - [man] Fuckin' A, man! - [all shouting] [all] Hey! [man] Where's he...? [Ana] Please... What's he doing? What's he...? No. No, I mean, they saw us, so... They're gonna be coming back, baby. Don't worry. They're gonna send somebody, something. [Ana] It's safe here. We'll just wait for them to come back. I don't want anybody sneaking around and stealing shit. Comprende? [lock clicks] Sweet dreams. I've just been informed that we're going off the air... [Bart] Wanna hear something that really sucks? ...and switching over to the Emergency Broadcasting System. You know that chick at Dairy Queen? [reporter] I don't know when we'll be back on the air. - The fat one? - Yeah. [reporter] Until then... [Bart] She was coming over tonight. I would have tapped that shit for sure. Bart, dude, everybody's dead, okay? Your mom's dead. Your brother's dead. That fat chick at Dairy Queen... [reporter]...to say a pleasure it's been... Dead. [reporter]...report the news these past 26 years. - God bless you. - Yeah. - [reporter] God bless America. - That sucks too. How do you think your God will judge you? Well, friends... now we know. When there is no more room in hell... the dead... will walk the earth. - [distant pounding] - [distant growling] - [static noise on TV] - What the hell? [Muzak playing] [gasping] - Hey, dumb-ass. - Hm? It's the timers. It's eight o'clock. - [sighs] - Terry. Go shut 'em off. It's Bart's turn. You're the trainee, man. Shit rolls downhill. I wish somebody was working at Hallowed Grounds. How hard is it to make a cup of coffee? I wanted a soy mocha latte with foam. Faggot. What are you doing? What's the news? Bad. Hey. Hey! Hey. What? The bathroom in here is fake, it doesn't work. I'll tell CJ. I'm telling you. You're the type of cat that goes to church and all that kind of shit, right? Yeah, I do all that kind of shit. So what do you think? Hm? What is this? Is this the end of times? 'Cause if it is, I'm telling you, I'm fucked. I'm serious. I've done some bad things in my life. Oh, I get it. You saw hell yesterday, now you're scared of going to hell for all the bad things you've done. I'll tell you what, go in the stall, say five Hail Marys, wipe your ass, and you and God can call it even. You think I feel like I deserve to be here? - Yeah. - Yeah, well, I don't. And I'm cool with that. But, you see, that's not it, 'cause I feel like I'm here for another reason. I feel like I'm here to bring that baby on this earth and give it everything that I never had. I just want the opportunity to change things. [Muzak continues playing] [Muzak stops] Shit! [gunshot] CJ! How did you get out? Who gave you permission to loot the goddamn stores? What are we gonna do about that truck? We're not gonna do anything about that truck. There's people in it. Yeah? And how do you know they're not fucked up like everybody else out there? Well, for one thing, they're driving a truck. - [gunfire] - Oh, and shooting guns. If we start letting people in here, we're gonna let the wrong ones in and then I'm dead, and I don't want to die. - Who are the wrong ones? - Nobody here is sick. I intend on keeping it that way. I just think... I did not ask for your opinion, lady! If you want to argue, argue with this. - [Michael] Hey, take it easy. - Shut your fucking mouth. Get the gun out of my face. You can't turn them away, CJ. You'll kill them. Tough shit. Self-defense. - I'm not killing anybody. - Know what? I'll kill you. No, no, Stop it, CJ. Don't do this. Shut up! I'll kill each and every one of you to stay alive, you hear me? Get the fucking gun out of my face! Oh. You got quite a mouth on you. Somebody should show her how to use it. Is there a holding cell in there? Yeah. Back of the security room. That's real good, man. You're gonna get us all killed, dumb-ass! Fucking traitor. - Get off me. - [Andre] Hey. I hope you got a good plan. Come on. [distant growling] - Hey! Hurry! - Through here. Down here. [Michael] I can't see a damn thing. [Andre] Me, either. [truck back up alert beeping] Why is he backing up the truck? [crash] - Through here! - Hey! Shit. What the fuck? We gotta go out there. You better throw that bullshit right out of your head. I'm not going back out there. That's not part of the plan. Change of plan. I'm gonna open the door. - No. - Okay. One, two... - Don't do it, man. - ...three. Come on, man. - Thanks. - Yeah. [growling] - [Andre] Shoot 'em in the head! - [gunshot] I don't see anybody. - Get back inside. They're fine! - Get back inside! Here you go. There are six more people inside the truck! - Andre, look! - [growling] [gun clicks] [moaning] [woman] Thank God. I couldn't stay in that fucking truck anymore. [Ana] All right, anybody who's injured, let's get you into Metropolis, right away, I'll take a look at you. Let me take a look at her. Can you help me... What's your name? Sorry. Uh, Glen. Yeah, sure. Just give me a second to collect myself, okay? - Thanks. - [Ana] Okay. If you want to wait for me in there, I'll take a look at your leg. Can you hold this? Yeah. We're just going right there. Oh, my arm. It's okay, ma'am. We'll make you nice and comfortable. The rest of you, we've got plenty of food and water. - Help should be along soon. - [chuckles] Help? Did you hear that from the same jackass who told us to go to St. Verbena? - The church downtown? - Yeah. It's the first place I went. Some dipshit on the radio said it was safe there. He was wrong. Is that where you picked them up? Well, I got this call on the CB from that guy Glen, saying all these folks were in the chapel. I was in the neighborhood so I picked them up. Well done. Thanks. Hey, I'm sorry, excuse me, when you two fellows are done blowing each other, maybe Davy Crockett can tell us the deal here. Well, we haven't heard much since the TVs went down... - Excuse me. Whose rig is that? - It's mine. - You mind if I borrow it? - I'm not using it, officer. - Keys? - They're in the cab. The truck's not gonna make it to Fort Pastor. No, forget the truck. That place is fucked, man. Bloodbath city. How do you know? We just came from there. Is everyone there dead? Dead-ish. Is everyone there dead? Yeah. In the sense that they all... sort of fell down and then... - I'll look for myself. - You're not gonna make it. - ...got up and... - I'll get as far as I can. Right now it's about one foot... ...started eating each other. - I'll take my chances. - Don't be an idiot. Please. There's people here right now could use your help. Fuck y'all. It's nice to see that you've all bonded through this disaster. [distant growling] [chuckles] Hey. You, uh, need anything? No, we're fine. Don't worry about us. He's got a bite on his hand. Yeah. - She's cold. - [labored breathing] That's good, right? - [moaning] - I don't know. It's weird. I've never seen an infection this bad that didn't come with a fever. That guy's arm looks pretty bad over there. You should probably check it out. All right. Stay with her for a minute. Here, let me take a look at that. I'm fine, really. They don't hurt much at all. Tucker could use you more than I could. His ankle's cut pretty bad. I'm just gonna clean it up a bit. [Terry] You okay? Ma'am, can I get you something? Like a glass of water? [deep gasps] Ana! Ana, come here! Anyone know her name? Died without a name? Damn. Guys, do you wanna move into the other room? Holy shit! [screams] [thud] [gasping] Holy shit. Holy shit. I think it's the bites. Frank said she was walking on her own when she got in the truck five hours ago. The bites killed her. The bites brought her back. How do you know? I watched it happen. I felt her pulse, she was gone. Then... Yesterday I saw the same thing to somebody else. I think that's why it spread so fast. All right. So who else in the group is bitten? Frank for sure. What about the one with the foot? Tucker? He says no, he fell. So it's Frank. Tall guy, right? Right. So we have to quarantine him right away. Where exactly do we do that? I don't know. There must be some place to keep him in here. Then what? I don't know. But... It's too dangerous to keep him around here. I'm sorry, what are we talking about here? Are we talking about killing him? Would you rather we waited for him to die and then he tries to kill us? Yes. No. You can't kill him. - Ana... - He's got a daughter! I'm sorry. I don't think there's any other choice. He's right. Michael, you can't do this. What if I'm wrong? You've seen it happen before. Frank? Michael's coming to shoot you. What are you talking about? You're infected. You're going to become one of them. [Frank] Is this true? Are you here to kill me? You've been bitten. It's only a matter of time. No. No. No. Leave my dad alone. Go away. You can't do this. You have to understand that she's lost everyone. Her mother, her two brothers. [sobbing] I'm all she's got. Well, Michael, what are you waiting for? [Frank's daughter sobbing] Go ahead. Kill him. Hey, kill Tucker, too. Wait a minute. I was never bit. We can't be sure. Do it, Michael. Are you sure it's the bite? No. She's sure. I'm sorry. [clicks teeth] - Hey. - Hi. Are you okay? Mm. Let me see your arm. It hurts. It's already starting to heal. Andre, I can't have baby here. Why not? People have been having babies for millions of years, all on their own, no hospitals. Wait. - Oh, yeah. [chuckles] - It's moving. I felt it. We gotta come up with a name for this baby. I want Russian name. Don't start that again. African name. - Please? - Come here and give me a hug. Terry, come on, man, open the door. Shut up. [CJ] Come on, don't tell me to shut up. Just come open the door. I got you this job. Come on. You want... every... single second. [sighs] Ana. I'm glad you didn't do it. - [howling] - [gun blast] ["Down With the Sickness" by Richard Cheese plays] [zombies shouting] - [gun blast] - [horse howls] - [spanking] - [woman moans] Fuck me harder! [bell jingles] [chuckles] [zombies growling] [gun blast] [chuckling] Holy shit. He got him. So, who do we have next? [man] Uh... Yeah. Burt Reynolds. Tell him, uh... tell him to get Burt Reynolds. [chuckles] [man] My goodness. Man, he's good. It barely even looked like him. Oh, oh... um... Rosie O'Donnell. Tell him to get Rosie. Yeah, Rosie. Nah, too easy. Give him something hard. You guys had really rough childhoods, didn't you? A little bit rocky? Hey, sweetheart, let me tell you something. You, uh, you have my permission, if I ever turn into one of those things, do me a favor, blow my fucking head off. Oh, yeah, you can count on that. [woman] Come on, harder. - [Muzak playing] - [laughter] Hey, Andre, how's Luda doing? She's fine. Hey, where's that lemon stuff? It's all gone. Steve likes to put it in his booze. Try the vanilla stuff. All right. I'd like to drop by and check on her, and just see how she's doing. No, thanks. She's fine. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. It's okay, hon. We understand. [distant growling] And before that, I worked in a stationery store. And I drove a snowplow. Fixed copiers. God, it's such a shame that this whole end-of-the-world thing's holding you back. [all laugh] - Okay, worst job. - Oh. I know which job I was the worst at. It was being a husband. That's not a job. - [Michael] It sure is. - [all chuckle] You guys just haven't met the right girl. Yeah, I tried it three times and... I got pink slips every time. What were you best at? Being a dad. I think I was best at that. - [gasps and screams] - [gun cocks] - [man] Everybody calm down. - [woman] Are they inside? [Michael] No. Does this place have generators? [screaming] Shh. Okay, shh. Shhh. It's all right, baby. - [screaming] - Shh. Baby, please. You got to be quiet, okay? It's gonna be all right. Our baby is on the way. It's coming. That's it. It's in employee parking level three. They keep them in a pen near the parking shuttles. Have fun. Hey, wait a minute. You're coming too. No, I'm not. I said I'd tell you where the generators are. I never said I'd show you. Did you think I'd just leave you two up here? You come with me or you go back in that cell. All right. I ain't going anywhere without a gun. Have at 'em, cowboy. [whispering] Asshole. Bart, get the chains. [loud noise] You ready to roll? You're coming with us? No, you're coming with me. I've done this before. Know how to use that? This one's the dangerous end, right? Now it is. [chuckles] [door closes] This is level one. We gotta walk down to three. [distant noise] [distant thud] [distant growl] What the fuck was that? I just saw something. You didn't see shit, Bart. Shut the fuck up. [loud noise] [distant noise] Oh, shit. Here it comes. [panting sound] [panting] Jesus Christ. It's a fucking dog. Come here, boy. [whimpers] At least we know nothing's down here or it would've eaten him. See? I told you I saw something. [dog barking] [Michael] What's wrong, boy? There's nothing wrong. That dog's just fucked up. [screaming] [growling] [louder growling] Run! Wait, CJ! Wait up! Wait! It's locked! It's fucking locked! [screaming] [Kenneth] Come on, let's go! CJ! I'm out! CJ! Matches! [howling] [howling stops] Breathe. You're doing good. Breathe. - [deep guttural breathing] - You're doing good, baby. I'm sorry. [gasps] [howling] [gasps] [baby music playing] - Thanks. - Okay. That's the last. I'm gonna go check on Luda. I haven't seen her in a while. - I'll go. - You sure? Yeah. I'll take them some candles. Okay. Let me know if they need anything. Okay. I'll have a smoke on the way. - See you. - Bye. [Luda groans] It's coming. I see it. [ripping sound] [flies buzzing] Guys? Oh, my God. It's a girl. - [growling] - [gasps] [gasping] You want to kill Luda? You want to kill my family? [Luda continues growling] [Andre screams] [groaning] Norma! Come on, Norma. What happened? The son of a bitch shot me. Get away from her. Wait. Just wait. She died of the gunshot. She wasn't bitten. She's gonna wake up though, right? [Ana] No. No, if she was one of them, she'd be up by now. [exhales deeply] - Terry? - [Terry] Yeah. Hold this. [squealing] [echoing gun blast] I've been to a lot of funerals. I've folded the flag and given it to a lot of wives and fathers and kids, and I told them how sorry I was. But that's not what I was really feeling. In the back of my mind, I was always saying, "Better them than me." But I don't believe that now. Because now I realize that there are some things worse than death and one of them is sitting here waiting to die. I don't want to die here. I saw a couple of buses in the garage. We could fix them up, we could reinforce them, then get as far from here as possible. And then what? Oh, I have an idea. Um... While we're at it, why don't we swing by the marina and hop in my boat and take it for a pleasure cruise, you jackasses. Wait a minute. That's a good idea. There's islands in the lakes, there's not a lot of people on them. I was kidding. How far is the marina? [chuckling] Oh, my God. You're serious? I think it's a damn good idea. How about the rest of you? Kenneth? Yeah, it's a good idea. We have to pick up Andy. He's part of the group. [chuckling] Excuse me. Not to shit on anyone's riff here but let me see if I grasp this concept, okay? You're suggesting that we take some fucking parking shuttles, and reinforce them with some aluminum siding and then head over to the gun store where we watch our good friend Andy play some cowboy-movie, jump-on-the-wagon bullshit. Then we're gonna drive across a ruined city through a welcome committee of a few hundred thousand dead cannibals, all so we can sail off into the sunset on this fucking asshole's boat? And head for some island that for all we know doesn't even exist? Yeah. Pretty much, yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm in. ["Hangman's Song" by Tyler Bates playing] We have 12 of these shotgun shells, twenty-six of those pussy.9-Mils, and 16 of those.357 Magnums. Yeah, well, that's still not very much, so hopefully we'll get to the dock and there won't be too many of them. Hm. Nice to see you busting your ass today. [chuckling] Oh, that's sarcasm. That is awesome. Yeah, you know, I would love to help but, uh... a captain never works alongside his men. [mimics whip sound] You guys have a good one. What a total dick. Guys, where did Chips go? Chips? Where'd you go, Chips? I can't find him. Chips? Come here. Come on, Chips! - [mockingly] "Come on, Chips!" - [woman] Where'd you go, honey? - Come on, boy. - [whistles] - [barks] - [gasps] Oh, there you are. Come on. There's my boy. Don't you ever leave me again, okay? Ever, ever. Hey. Kenneth wants everyone upstairs for a meeting. Come in here first. I want you to see this. When those things are on the side of the bus, this'll get them off. Cool, huh? Wow. That might be the most romantic thing anyone's ever shown me. [Michael chuckles] I'm trying here. Yeah, I know. It's not just about him starving, Steve. If we go to pick him up and he doesn't have his strength, then we're gonna be carrying him. It's... She's right. [man] He's a hell of a shot too. We're gonna need him. I'm not saying we don't need him. There's no point in arguing about this. We need a solution. We need to get some food over there. I have an idea. We draw straws and the loser runs across with a ham sandwich. [mock laughter] [Ana] Could you be a bigger prick? I think so but that's irrelevant. My question to you is what's your plan? Come on! - [whistles] - [overlapping chatter] I got it. We've got to get over there anyway... - Shut up! - ...more ammunition, all right? I have an idea. Stop, it's hurting him! No! He's not safe! Nicole, they're not interested in him, I promise. Okay, they want us, okay? Chips is gonna be fine. - [barking] - [zombies growling] [whistling] See? Look, he's walking right by them. They're not even paying attention to him. [Kenneth] The walkie's in the bag? [man] Yeah. Let me see. Let me see! [Andy blows whistle] - [Chips barks] - [Nicole] There he is. Good boy. Good boy, Chips. - Okay, he's there, he's in. - Give me those. Oh, man. - What? What? - No. No. Oh, man. They got him. They got him! [gunfire] I'll try him on the radio. Andy. Andy, do you copy? Andy, can you hear me? Andy? [Andy] Can you hear me? Hello? This thing working? I'm dinged up pretty bad but I think I'm gonna be okay. Where are you hurt, Andy? Goddamn, those bastards bite hard. I just have to stop the bleeding. - It's really going. - [Chips barks] Easy, boy. Easy. Is this Ken? Is that you, man? Yeah, it's me, brother. Hey, man, good to hear your voice. I guess we're gonna meet up-close pretty soon, huh? Oh, shit, hang on. Ah, Jesus. He got me good. You just hang in there. - You got the food, right? - [Andy] Yeah. - Do we tell him? - [Chips barks] [Andy] Hey, this dog got a name? - See, Nicole, Chips... Nicole? - [tires screeching] What the hell's that? Oh, my God, it's Nicole! [tires screeching] Shit. That idiot's going after the fucking dog. She made it! She's in! [Nicole] Guys, I found Chips! I got him. He's okay! Nicole, how's Andy looking? [Nicole] I don't know. There's a lot of blood in here. It's everywhere! There's blood everywhere! Wait a minute, I see him. He's on the roof. He's writing something. What's it say? [Nicole] Guys? Tell her to get out! - [Nicole] Guys? - What's wrong? Nicole, baby, how's the truck? [Nicole] I'm not going back out there. - [Chips barks] - [Nicole] Chips, be quiet! Tell her to get the hell out now! Honey, listen to me. You need to find a place to hide. Can you do that? [Nicole] What do you mean? What's going on? - Nicole? - [Nicole] Here's Andy. - [growling] - [Nicole] Oh, my God! No! Tell her to get out! Nicole, listen to me. [Nicole sobbing] I'm in a closet but he's outside, he's trying to get... [Michael] Nicole? Nicole? [Nicole] Help me. Please, you have to help me! I'm gonna die! [static noise] We need to do something. Now. Tucker, listen, when we come back through here we may have company. You need to stay here and make sure that fire door stays open. Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Uh... Why does he stay here while I go on the suicide mission to rescue Terry's already dead girlfriend? Fuck you, man. We don't know that. Either way, we've gotta get over there and get the guns to get out of this parking lot. Michael, it's okay. - Let him stay. - Yeah. Steve, don't fuck this up. Yeah. Totally. [rats squeaking] [CJ] All right. That's it. [Michael] Are you sure? I ain't a plumber but I'd say we're at the end of the line. [zombies moaning] [distant growling] [pounding] [growling] Go! Go! Through here! Hurry up! [Ana] Hurry up. Hurry! .357,.357. What do you need? .38,.38. Here. - [Ana] Damn it. - [Michael] Hurry up. All right. Oh, shit. - Nicole? - [pounding] [growling] - Andy. - [growls] - I'm sorry, brother. - [growls] [Andy stops growling] [thud] [Michael] Nicole, are you in there? [Nicole] I'm here! I'm here! [Chips whimpers] [Kenneth] Get as much ammo as you can. [man] CJ! Over here, hurry up! Over here! Go! Get down! Look out! Come on, Tucker! Come on! - Shit! - [screams] - Ah, my leg! - I got you, Tucker. Go! Go! [zombie growls] Shit! Go! Go! [screams] Shoot me! Shoot me! - [Nicole] Hurry! Come on! - [Chips barks] Hurry, hurry! Goddamn Steve Markus! - [Nicole] Steve, come on! - Open up! [Nicole] Open the door! Open the door! - [Michael] Steve! - I'll fucking kill him! [growling] [Michael] Steve! Let's go! [screeching] God damn it! [Kenneth] Move! - Go! - Move it, guys, move it! [woman] Where are you guys going? - Just go right now! We're going! - Go! Go! They're right behind us! Go! Go! Go! [growling] Come on, move! They're right behind us! Get in! [man] Close the door! [Muzak plays] I like this song. [Chips barks] Everybody in! Hey, there you are. What the hell happened to you guys? Prick. I'll deal with you later, motherfucker! Wait a minute! Nicole! Get in! I'll take the gun. Okay. Okay, let's get out of here! Hold on! Oh, Christ! CJ, now! Go! [growling] They're trying to turn us over! Hit 'em with the saw! - [chainsaw buzzes] - [shrieking] [screams] [CJ] Give me a shotgun! Holy shit. There's still one hanging on. Which fucking side? Right side! - I got him. - [chainsaw buzzes] - You gotta drive faster, man. - [growling] Hard left! Hard left here! [screaming] Whoa, stop! Stop, guys! - What? - We lost them. Back it up! Back it up! Back up! Kenneth, are you there? Kenneth? [coughing] [Ana] Kenneth, are you there? Kenneth, are you okay? What the fuck? - [growling] - [screaming] What are you doing? Fucking nursery school. CJ! Ana, no! Everyone's dead. Steve took off. What? [CJ] Let's go! Come on! Steve! - [howling] - I got him. Damn. [growling] Look out! Come on, come on! Go, go, go! - [gun blast] - Open the door! - Hurry up! - Come on! Guys, get in! Let's go. Where's Ana? Ana! Ana! - Get in! Get in! - [Ana screams] - What the hell were you doing? - [truck engine starts] [engine revs] [Chips barks] [Chips barks] Hold on! [Chips barks] - Come on, boy. - Go. Kenneth! Here. Get out on the end of the dock. - [Kenneth] CJ, come on. - Do it! I'll catch up! There it is! Terry, get the bowline! - [cocks gun] - Shit. CJ! Damn! Fuck! Come on! Bitch! Shit. Come on. I'll blow every fucking thing up. [approaching growls] Okay, let's go, let's go. - I can't go. - What? Downtown when they jumped on us. Oh, no, Michael. No. I have to stay here. You can't. No, you... I'm sorry, Ana. - I can help you. - No, you can't. You can help them. Stay on the boat. I can help you. It's okay. It's gonna be all right. No. It won't. Hey. It will. You sure you wanna do this? Yeah. I think I'll just stay here a while. Enjoy the sunrise. [boat engine starts] [gun blast] ["People Who Died" by The Jim Carroll Band playing] I run a tight ship. - Where did you get that thing? - [Terry] I found Steve's camera. [chuckling] Put that down and help us. - [Terry screams] - [growling] [Terry] Kenneth, fucking shoot it! [Terry] Christ! [Terry] Oh, shit! Get your damn camera out my face. ...like there's anyone there. Terry, put the camera down and help us off the boat. - [Chips whimpers] - [Terry] Nicole, what is it? [Nicole] Chips, no! [Chips barks] [approaching growls] [Terry] Oh, shit! [Kenneth] Stay behind me! - [growling] - [gunfire] ["Down with the Sickness" by Disturbed playing]
