(This movie is suitable for ages 12 and older) MEGABOX JOONGANG PLUS M presents a JUPITER FILM production Written by JUNG JA YOUNG Cho Seung-woo Ji Sung Kim Sung-kyun What makes an auspicious site? The land’s energy that can change people’s fates. But there’s no end to the land’s owners’ greed. Is the power of auspicious lands to change fate now theirs? Directed by Park Hee-kon Your Highness? The royal physician has come. My fever and headache won’t heal with the decoctions. Now, I can’t even sleep. This decoction will clear your head, sir. It’ll help you sleep well, and feel better, sir. How could… you… Is this the auspicious site to bless my descendants? Yes, Your Majesty. The best Feng Shui masters of the court found it. The best Feng Shui masters of the court found it. Do you see it as so? If the Crown Prince is buried here, the royal family will reign forever. Then this will be the burial site. Yes, Your Majesty. No, Your Majesty! It’s a cursed site that should never be a royal tomb, sire. How dare you! Should the Crown Prince be laid here, the young prince will die young and bear no son, sire. Tell me more. The water veins on both sides will cool the corpse. The snake coil shaped rocks will crush the corpse and suffocate it, sire. This isn’t the great site, but beyond the bushes to the right. Your Majesty. No, sire. This site has great positive qi, with good, even soil, sire. It’s the most auspicious gravesite for the good of the land, so please ignore him, sire. He’s just a young trainee in Feng Shui. Then bury my son here. Yes, sire. Who was that fool? He’s the son of the former chief Feng Shui master, Park Dae-min. He read all the ancient books on Feng Shui in his teens. He’s known as a Feng Shui prodigy, sir. Park Dae-min? For King Jeongjo’s royal tomb, he said to move your grandfather’s grave from state land. You demoted him to the country. Then he sequestered himself. I remember. He was a headache then. Like father like son! I’ll see that he remains quiet, sir. That won’t be enough. It’s here somewhere… Turn right… There it is! Hello! Is anyone home? Is anyone home? Who’s there? Why! Yong-shik! What’s with all this food, ma’am? For my husband’s dear friend, it’s not much. I apologize. Please! I came unannounced late at night. I should apologize. Enjoy your meal, then. Thank you. When others land posts in the palace, they are set in 3 years to provide for 3 generations. Why is the best Feng Shui master living like this? I didn’t work at the palace to provide for 3 generations, but to serve His Majesty for the good of the country. So you think! What about your wife and baby? They not only have to aid you but His Majesty and the country? You came all this way to scold me? No! I missed you. You don’t even have an outhouse? You break wind as loudly as ever. I’m the king of farting! Why you! How dare you say that? The king of farting? Whatever, pal! Let’s see how great you are! -Stop looking! -No I won’t! Jae-sang! Your house! No! No! Wait...! Jae-sang! Look! Those men must’ve come for you! Wait! It’s too late! Let’s go! No! Stop! You can’t go! Oh no… No, no. You can't... Jae-sang... FENGSHUI (13 YEARS LATER) This area will help anyone land a post in the palace. Especially if it faces that peak. There! That house is the best. Really? The auspicious site must’ve brought them fortune. I don’t know if the owner will sell it. Don’t worry, my friend! It’s worth 5 or 6 pennies. I’ll pay you twice it’s worth! How about 10 pennies? I said I’m not selling this house! My great-grandfather built it. I won’t sell! Never! You’re tough! Fine! How about 20 pennies? No more! Didn’t you hear me? I inherited this from my ancestors! 50 pennies! What? They all sell their inherited land for the right price! Start rumors about landing posts. Target rich familes preparing for the state examination. Yes, sir. Don’t just go and drink there! -I don’t have the money to. -Why you! Let’s do this right! Start the rumors! Go! Don’t worry, sir! To get a post in court and become wealthy, you must settle on the right site! Right, Master Park? Look there! Look at the peak like the tip of a brush. That’s Writer’s Peak. Many people have passed the state exam from here. It’s thanks to the vigor of that peak. We call a house like this the ‘Bird’s Nest Site’. It means it’s perfect to raise and educate kids here. The owner will want at least 50 pennies to sell. I never said I’d sell it! It’s been my family’s for generations! Go away! Are you the owner? Yes, I am! I’ll buy it for any price. How much do you want? Would 100 pennies do? I’m not going to sell my ancestor’s land for that! I’ll pay 200 pennies! You people! 300 pennies! Well… -350! No! 400 pennies! -Well… 400 pennies! Anyone else? 440 pennies! Sir! Feng Shui master! Wait, sir! Sir! Listen to me. Rich aristocrats can move and make their sons study there. But poor folks like us can’t. Is there anything I can do for my son to study better? Hearing about your son, the problem is that his desk faces the wall. The desk can’t be facing It’s good to keep watch on him, but it’s hard for him to focus on studying Place the desk to face the door. He’ll study better. Hang a wind chime by the window. The bright, clear sound will help clear his mind as well. I haven’t borne a child in over 3 years. My in-laws say that I’m cursed to bring the family to ruin. Oh my… You live at the foot of Mt. Gwanaksan? You must move. But everyone says it’s an auspicious site. The rocks are lined up with the qi going to the sky. The fiery qi does not suit a home. It’s a good site for schools or government offices. It’s exhausting for men. Thus, they left home frequently and soothed themselves with ale and women. They probably brought in many children outside of marriage. How did you know that? What good is moving to a new site if my husband won’t sleep with me? Why you! Will you try as I say? Sleep on a red blanket. It must be placed in a slant. Yin flows from the narrow out. And from the door, your husband must lie on the inside and you by the door. This will keep his energy from escaping out the door. Dear! Please come inside. Dear? I’ve been waiting. I’ve been devoutly waiting for His Majesty to call… Let us meet the master! No! You can’t meet him! Let us meet the master! Stop! Please! Let us in! Why you! You can’t barge in here! He’s busy! We’re desperate! Please! We need help! -No! -There he is! Feng Shui master! Please hear us! We’re desperate, sir! -Please? -No! Some aristocrats built a new market down the street, sir. Everyone goes there now! Our market is dead, sir! Go catch flies at least! You fool! The stores are selling things even with losses! They’re trying to ruin us, then make money later! They’re killing our market to collect more from their land! Even without them, this was doomed to fail. But our market was the busiest before that other market, sir. That’s because it was the only one. Customers had no choice. You think they came because it’s nice here? Are you trying to help us or not, sir? As water flows from top to bottom, people move to the land. You must make people want to pass through. Let’s start by filling the holes in the ground. I bought this yesterday! Move the colorful silk shop at the back, and the noisy smithy to the front. It’s good to keep the market looking busy and loud. Let customers see many different merchandise. The pottery shop goes here. The straw shoes shop, here. Lure in more customers with tasty scents. Move the mill to the front. See here? Put the tavern in this empty site. People must come and go to get business. Plant flower trees in front to look bright and beautiful. Yong-shik? You plant the trees. Trees? Me? You’re good! Yong-shik? Not there, friend! Two feet over! Of course! Right. I sense killings here. Drive in a large stake to stop them. A cow used to kill its calves at birth here, remember? Amazing! How’d he know? Wait! Let’s go! Good! Thank you, sir! Your fee, sir. No need. You’ve suffered enough loss. Though it’s on a hilltop, there should be a spring here. Use that to dig a well and give water to travelers. Then you’ll be blessed more. Thank you, sir! Thank you! The fee… Ah, take care. Thank you, sir! Are you insane? We helped them for days and you accept no pay? We agreed to half! How could you? Well, half it was! I read the land and you dug it. Every tide has its ebb. The auspicious land to bring our clan wealth and honor forever… Where is it? Gyeonggi-do Eonju, Angol and Dokgol villages, and Maljukgeori. They may seem ungainly now, but they will bring great riches and power in the future, sir. Angol has Heolleung, the royal tombs. And the late king allowed commoners to farm on it. Make the land around the royal tombs all yours, sir. If you own all of Heolleung, who would know what you do to it? We need to harvest for the winter! See this? If the landlord says to leave, you leave! You’re telling us to starve to death? This is our land! Chase them all out of here! Beat them or kill them if they won’t listen! How could ministers sell the royal tomb lands and chase the farmers out! Please be calm, Your Majesty. It is unhealthy, sire. I know their wicked schemes! They used others’ names to buy and sell land, to eventually make it theirs! Why is the court empty? Where are the ministers? Your Majesty… Well… Let’s drink! We congratulate your birthday, sir. Happy birthday, sir. Thank you. I appreciate your great gift of the land around Heolleung. It’s just useless land near the royal tombs. What’s so great about that, sir? Let’s drink together! Sir Kim Jwa-geun! Happy birthday! Stop! Heung-seon has come to congratulate you! Out of my way! Sir Kim Jwa-geun! Well, well! You’re all here! It’s great to see you, sirs! Sir Kim Jwa-geun! I was busy, but came all this way to celebrate your birthday, sir! We should drink and be merry all we want today! Servants! Bring me some ale! I want ale! Who’s this? Duke Heung-seon. My friend! I came to celebrate your father’s birthday! They dared to stop me from coming in! Tell them, my friend! Oh really? But you came empty-handed to my father’s birthday party? Then you should at least give him a laugh to earn your drinks. Crawl under me and get the food. Here! Just like our dog over there. There. Fetch. Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! What a sight! Is he a royal or a dog? That’s why I didn’t kill him. He’s fun to watch! Here! Take that! Here, too! Continue the music and dance. I want more ale! You want more? Are you insane? Know how much you spent here for three days? Money is useless when I die. I’ll spend it all on drinks here! Why you! Whatever! See all this? He’s got a lot more money than he looks! Why you! You won’t give your heart, but you want his money? You won’t give your heart, but just want my body, sir. That’s true. Will you give me this if I tell you, sir? You don’t trust me? If you find out, I’ll give you one of these. No! He’s completely drunk! Put that down now! I came to see who’s been showering our gisaengs with money, sir. Let me introduce myself. I’m Cho-sun, the chief gisaeng, sir. You’re the chief? You’re so beautiful. Leave us, girls. You’ll reward any information on Sir Kim Jwa-geun’s father’s grave? Sir Kim is our best customer here. My girls could get killed for trying to find out, sir. I’ll pay for your drinks. Please drink quietly and go, sirs. Are you insane! We drank inside the tiger’s cave? Stop it, Jae-sang. You spent all that money for nothing! I’ll keep trying until I find out. Kim Jwa-geun became powerful after moving his father’s grave. All Feng Shui masters know that. I just don’t know where. He killed anyone involved with moving the grave. It can’t be found! Let’s say you somehow find it. Then what? I’ll crush his bones for ills to fall on his clan for generations! That’s preposterous! What would that change? Why waste our hard-earned money in finding the tomb? Buy some homes and land in the capital. If we keep working, we can live well. This won’t bring back the dead. -Think of your future. -Listen. But this is my fate. Wait for me! The royal tomb lands represent royal authority. It can’t be sold at will to private buyers! Your Majesty. I’m afraid it may appear you have no concern for people’s hardships, but only to protect the assets of the royal family, sire. Please reconsider. Your Majesty! Though the royal tomb lands were sold, who would dare diminish your reign? Please reconsider, sire. Please, Your Majesty! Kim Jwa-geun and his relatives in the court are behind it, sire. People are whispering the palace now belongs to the Kim clan, sire. Uncle. I think as you do. However, the ministers raised their voices and threatened me. If we don’t have a plan to stop them, just as they killed your late father, they’ll harm you, too. Recently, my father appeared in my dreams. He did not look well at all. I cannot erase him from my mind. I must check his grave to see if he is well. -To be sure. -Your Majesty! Digging up his grave could bring grave consequences! Your Majesty! It is the most auspicious site. When selecting your father’s grave, a Feng Shui trainee suggested it was problematic. However, they didn’t check and just built the tomb there. I remember. And most of the land around it is now owned by the Kim clan. Kim Jwa-geun now controls even the royal tomb lands. We must take action and re-establish royal authority. 13 years ago, I know what happened in choosing my father’s gravesite. An impious fool cajoled about it, but it was deemed groundless. All the Feng Shui masters said it was the most auspicious site. You say to sell the royal tomb lands, and now my father’s tomb? Why can’t I see to it? Your Majesty. A king can’t be blinded by theories of yin and yang. Who should I leave the affairs of this land to? I am quite concerned, sire. What? Please reconsider, sire! Talking about my father’s grave proved fruitless. We lost Heolleung, the royal lands. Do what he says and you’ll prosper. There’s more? Let’s eat first. Almost done. The last customer is waiting. Come inside, sir. This way. What kind of site would you like? I’ll explain. Do you want wealth, posts, or great descendants? That’s his question. I want to know where Kim Jwa-geun’s father is buried. I know you’re dying to know, too. Who are you? I’m Duke Heung-seon. Duke Heung-seon? The famous royal dog? My apologies, sir! What are you doing? He’s of royal descent! Forgive my ignorance, sir. Greet them. Behind me is my cousin, Won-kyeong. And the rest are my close friends. We’re the same age. Let’s be friends. How dare I befriend a royal, sir? What royal? He called me a dog. I deserve to die, sir! Why ask me and not the royal Feng Shui masters? 13 years ago, I heard you were against what they said was auspicious. Is it true? Why are you curious of that, sir? It’s not me. His Majesty wants to know. Then I’ll meet His Majesty and explain to him directly. What you said was true? Your Majesty. It may seem like an auspicious site, but it is also a cursed place. Can a land be both good and bad? Let’s dig the land to see if he’s right. What if he’s wrong, sire? The Kim clan will use it againt you, sire. But I must do something. I must protect my father’s grave! Think of the consequences, sire. Please go there now, sire. You’ll know once it is dug. Wait! Found it! Open it. Water! Snakes! Everyone said it was a great site. It was all a lie? From the start, they buried my father in a cursed site? No, Your Majesty. There is an auspicious site a few feet away, sire. Then why bury my father here instead of there? The auspicious site is not empty. It’s clearly used as a grave, sire. Though it doesn’t appear to be one, someone’s grave is definitely there, sire. Dig there at once! Hurry! Wait! Kim Jo-soon… Where my father’s tomb should be, Kim Jwa-geun buried his father? They defiled my father and the court! Seize Kim Jwa-geun and his clan! Sir! The head court maid has come. He took the royal gards and dug up his father’s grave, sir. Gather everyone! We were all summoned, sir. If we go now, we’ll be dead! They found your father’s grave. There’s no way out of this, sir. He’ll seek revenge for his father. It’s over for us, sir! But we just did what you told us to, sir. Gentlemen! We must find a way to live. That’s why I called you all here. Your Majesty! Sir Kim Jwa-geun has arrived! Wretched fool! You’ll pay for your sin! Your Majesty. I just followed the ministers regarding your father’s grave, sire. I sought to charge them. When they tried to run away, I killed them all, sire. Don’t kill me! So please relent your anger, sire. Then why was your father buried there? Blinded by their treachery, I did such a foolish thing. Please kill me, sire. Please kill us, sire! Order us to death! We deserve to die! Please kill us! How can the royal court be so? If people find out, it’ll weaken your authority, sire. Let’s move the graves quietly. When I die, bury me in a site to bless the royal line for generations. Whether it be 200 or 400 km away, it doesn’t matter. A land that will crush the Kim clan’s power… Please… Bury me there. Do you understand? Your Majesty… You must. How great are their gravesites that they control the royals and have so much power? I’ll dig all their ancestors’ graves and scatter their bones. If we get caught, we’re dead! They’ll find us soon anyway and strike us. We must do something. We must sever their fortune from the land. I… I… heard he performs r… rites for all his ancestors at… at home. -Not… not at their gr… gra… -Graves? So… so… no… no one… So no one knows? I can’t breathe, sir. Me… me, too. We can’t search the entire country for their graves. We must get their map of the graves. That’s not something you can find in the markets! You’ll have to steal it. The qi is gone from digging up the grave. I must move father’s grave somewhere else. How about Heolleung? It’s fine to bury a sound body there, but it’s not effective to move your father’s grave there. Then find me a more auspicious site. The best land in the country that no one else can have. That’s not easy to find, sir. You’ve buried him temporarily. Take time to find it, sir. You must know where it is already? But a land like that is wanted by many, sir. Many want to rule the world like you, sir. Thank you for coming, but I have a prior engagement. I must be going, sir. That ingrate! Why let him get away, father? Order me to kill him at once. -I’ll cut off his head. -You fool! There’s a time for everything. Keep careful watch on him until the time comes. Yes, Father. Welcome. The chief gisaeng? I know you’ve met before. She has something important to say. Kim invited Feng Shui masters to find a new grave for his father. I received orders to send gisaengs to tend to them. Doesn’t he have a secret Feng Shui master he trusts? From what his son said, he is being difficult, so they’re looking for a new one. Here’s what you asked for, sir. This is Kim Jwa-geun’s house. I went there several times. It should be right. His secret storehouse is… here! At the inner annex. The map of tombs must be there. I’ll sneak in and get it. Not you, my friend. They know you. It’s dangerous. It’s dangerous for anyone. Then it’s better that I do it. If they catch you, His Majesty will also be in danger. Even if things go wrong, I will never reveal your name. Pretend you don’t know me. I owe you so much. Wait a while. I’ll be sure to repay you. We have the same goal. You don’t owe me, sir. I chose this. The burden is mine. Still, I worry that you could be in danger. My father was killed by Kim Jwa-geun in trying to protect our land. You took me in when I had nowhere to go. It’s the least I can do to repay you, sir. Soon, we’ll be victorious. The test will be held in the outer guest house. After Kim Jwa-geun looks at the writings, he calls in only those he is interested in. So I must gain his interest? The areas at the foot of Mt Bugaksan. Cheongun-dong, Gahoe-dong, and Jae-dong. We already own those lands. Next. Where Cheonggyecheon creek flows through. Gurigae, Dong-hyeon, Jongno, and Myeongnye-dong. They’re auspicious lands that flow with money. Our ancestors already bought them years ago. That’s why Jeong thinks he can act big around me! No one knows where the best auspicious land is? Gyeonggi-do Eonju, Angol Dokgol, and Maljukgeori. If you build and reside here, you’ll get riches. If you make graves, your descendants will be prosperous. But Heolleung is there, the land of the royal tombs. Will you still have it, sir? Close the doors and let him in. Where did you learn Feng Shui? He’s famous among the people as a great Feng Shui master, sir. Tell me. I can’t have the entire land that you spoke of. If you could choose just one, what would be the best? By all means, Heolleung, sir. How dare you! That land is for royal tombs! Will you then pass on the best land, sir? Such bravery for a Feng Shui master! By the way, you look familiar. Perhaps it’s because I’ve always admired you from afar. Thank you, sire. Did you say ‘sire’? Such an eloquent speaker, too. Feng Shui masters earn keep with the tongue, not the land. Sir! Master Jeong has arrived. I’ll call for you soon. Yes, sir. Heavens! What are you doing here? Let’s go! Hurry! To the side of the guest house, there’s a path to a sidedoor. It leads to a three-forked path. Take the one in the middle. It leads to Kim’s private quarters. His private soldiers stand guard. Be careful. There’s a long hallway past the main porch. This way! I saw him come out of a room at the end with the map. Step aside. I can open any door with these! You’ll try all those keys? You said it’d be quick! It’ll be quick if it fits or it could take a hundred tries. Shh! Shh! It’s unlocked! So many locks! Must I unlock them all? Measely Feng Shui masters who get paid pennies? You’ll change your family’s fate with them? What a pity. Well, it’s because you demand a house for a few words. You’ve changed, sir. Open! Please! Please open! You asked for land to put the royals at your feet, sir? Watch what you say! Let’s go to my private quarters. -Yong-shik! -What? Go back! Now, tell me. There is an auspicious land that I haven’t mentioned yet, sir. It’s the best land that can change the king’s last name. What? Change the king’s last name? Who will be the new king? Where the new king will be decided, move your father’s grave to there. You’ll gain riches and 2 generations of kings. Really? What good is someone from our Kim family becoming king? I already have the king under my feet. Why become a weak king like that? Well done, sir. However, the king could come from the Cho, Kang, or Park clans. Would your family be able to rule the king then? If you don’t want it, I’ll seek another owner, sir. Bring the map. Sir Kim Jwa-geun! -Go back, sir! -Move! That damn bastard! Let me go, fools! -Deal with him! -Come out, sir! Sir Kim Jwa-geun! -Let go! -Leave now! Friend! It’s Heung-seon! I heard there’s a party! I came to pay my respects to Sir Kim! They treat me with such contempt! You fool! You still haven’t come to your senses? Friend! Damn vermin! How dare you! I apologize. How dare you come here! Let go, you vermin! Damn vermin. Damn pest! Stop at once! I told you to hold your temper! Why touch a pest like him and cause a scene! I’ll come another day to talk quietly, sir. Guards! Chase him out now! Damn worthless men of the Yi clan! Over there! Grab hold! Pull! Let's go. Who’s there? What brings you here, sirs? What were you doing here? Who are you! Well… You fool! How dare a slave ask such questions to nobles! Did Sir Kim teach you that? Where are your manners? Shall I beat some sense into you? Sir Kim invited me here, but I got lost on my way back! Must I explain myself to a humble servant like you! Please forgive my ignorance, sir. Please have mercy, sir. Because of my ties to Sir Kim, I’ll let it go this once. Away with you! You fool! Where are your manners! Away with you! You spoke so well back there! I was surprised, sir! How did Sir Heung-seon know to come to our rescue? We could’ve been caught. It… it took…took… too long. He… he… thought something was wrong. I shouldn’t have asked. It’s a good thing he was born a royal. Over there! Sir! Sir! Heung-seon! Sir! Heung-seon! Open your eyes! Are you all right? Do I look all right, my friend? Oh no. Stop shaking me. It hurts! Why you! What is it? These are the royal tombs of late kings. And these are the tombs of Kim’s ancestors. You mean… Not just beside the royal tombs, but on top of other kings! They buried their ancestors to oppress and weaken the royal family. That’s why they held ancestral rites in secret. What… What should we do with… with… the bastards? There’s more, sir. They talked about a land to bring 2 generations of kings. They’ll change the royal family. Isn’t that treason? A land of 2 generations of kings? What does that mean? It’s nothing. It’s but a mere rumor. Is it really but a rumor? I must know for sure. Why do you want to know? What if the Kim clan grabs hold of that land? And a new family rules the land! We can’t let that happen! There is no such land. Feng Shui master Jeong lied. Forget it. It really doesn’t exist? Or don’t you know? I said it doesn’t exist! Everyone searched to find it to stop the threat of treason, but it was never found. I went to every place rumored to bring about kings. Fields, rivers, and mountains! I searched everywhere, but it didn’t exist. What master Jeong refers to does not exist in the country! The most auspicious land! Where 2 generations of kings shall rise! It’s but a mere rumor. Like I said, it doesn’t exist. Kim Jwa-geun will soon realize his map is missing. If we do something, he’ll know we stole it. Then he’ll kill us! What do we do? Did you hear? Kim Jwa-geun buried his grandfather, his great grandfather, and great, great grandfather all in the royal tombs! What in the world? Is that true? Yes! It’s the talk of the village! You heard too, didn’t you? Right? You could get in trouble. Watch it! Let’s go. But it’s the truth! Says who? Everyone knows! Kim took the royal gravesite and buried all his ancestors secretly inside the royal tombs! That’s why the Kim clan has been so powerful! -Is that true? -Yes! Damn greedy bastards! Why dig up even the kings’ tombs? They should rot in hell! Sir! There’s trouble! What? But sir! It was here a few days ago, sir! It’s true, sir. Do you know what that was? It holds the fate of our family! You failed to protect the map! How dare you! Sir! Here, sir. I searched around some broken roof tiles, sir. This was on the ground, sir. They’re glasses from mainland China. They must belong to a royal or noble. Find the map at once! Kill a thousand if you must, and bring it back! Understood? Yes, sir. Who did that! What is it? Forgive me for this, Your Majesty, as I can’t meet you in person. It wasn’t just your father’s grave. The Kim clan buried their ancestors over other royal tombs. Even the people are aware of this fact, sire. Please remove the Kim clan’s ancestors’ bones, to protect the royal family and the fate of this land. Royal guards! Prepare to charge! Make way for His Majesty! Make way for His Majesty! Make way for His Majesty! You fool! Kim Jwa-geun has defiled the court! Come out at once! Why nephew, you came? You may come in. How dare you! I’m the king of this country! Come down and kneel before me! Who taught you to threaten a family elder with royal guards? Was it your dead father? Or is it a rude tradition of the Yi family! Why you! You’re begging to die! You dare speak to me like that because of the guards? Do you think they’re yours? For the king of this country, you’re an embarrassment. A thief came in to my house and left this behind. It belongs to your father’s cousin, Won-kyeong. Did you order it? Did you make Won-kyeong steal to try and frame me? Tell me! What do you men think? Your Majesty. We won’t follow a king who cares about supersitions and tries to frame a loyal subject. We won’t follow, sire! What will you do? Will you stop acting like a king? Or be my puppet king to live? You saw your father’s bones. Do you think he died naturally? Stop questioning my ancestors’ graves. If you don’t, I’ll dethrone you and kill your son. No! Don’t kill my unborn baby! I beg you! What? Say it properly. Great maternal uncle, I beg you, sir. That’s better. Listen! His Majesty wasn’t involved in Won-kyeong stealing from me. Won-kyeong tried to frame me for treason. I’ll punish him myself! Seize him! Feeble fool! You couldn’t have done it alone. Who planned this with you? Rotten bastard! Stop insulting a royal! Hurry! Kill me! Your Majesty! Save Won-kyeong to defend the royal court’s authority! Entrust me with soldiers, sire. I’ll kill Kim Jwa-geun and his clan and rescue Won-kyeong, sire! The royal guards don’t belong to me. Let him be an example. Kill him slowly but surely. But Your Majesty! Enough! If he doesn’t die, the Crown Prince will. My son in Queen’s womb will die. Uncle. Please… Leave me. Cousin… I… I… I… didn’t say anything. Make sure… you… you… stay alive. Kim Jwa-geun will… will die someday. For now, protect your life. What if we get killed, too? Shouldn’t we stop now? I can’t watch Kim Jwa-geun get away with treason! Your wife and son died because of your stubbornness! The king or not, you should protect your life! You must live to… I was a Feng Shui master who served the king and country! This happened because I didn’t do my job 13 years ago. I’m trying to do it now. Only then will I not be ashamed before my wife and son. Where did you go this late at night? To meet a lover? Born with such ill fate, whom would I have to depend, sir? I went to a temple to pray. That seems to help my troubles. Is life so hard for you? Sir? I want to meet the Feng Shui master. Who? The great master who found your ancestors’ gravesites. Who knows? If I move my ancestors’ graves, I may become a queen. Don’t have false hopes. That’s not happening. But if you want it so, I’ll let you meet him. However, I’ll rip you to shreds if you ever tell of his whereabouts. Is Heung-seon home? He’s at his quarters, sir. Your Majesty. Did you enjoy your lunch, sire? Yes, I did. Did you enjoy yours, Father? Yes, sire. I’m honored by Your Majesty’s concern. Your Majesty? You must keep your dignity as a royal, no matter what happens. I will, Father. Well done, my son. Great! Heung-seon? You came? What are you doing? I was just playing with my son. I mean, if anyone else saw, they’d think you’re a traitor. Though a royal, he is fated not be served as such. We played so he can be served at least from his father. Don’t mind it. Now that you’re here, everything is ready. Let’s go. What brings you here, sir? Did your father send you? I came for another reason. If my father upset you, let it go. He was just sensitive from all the recent troubles. There’s something I didn’t mention. 2 generations of kings can’t be assured by moving his father’s grave. What do you mean? The corpse is already tainted. Burying it there may be fruitless. However, there is a way to bring glory to the clan for certain. What’s that? There is a living body. How would you like to become the king? Then your father must be buried in that site. Master Jeong. Your quip is amusing You’re Cho-sun, the gisaeng. You have the face of a great noble or even a queen. Is that so? Thank you, sir. However, if you say the wrong thing you’ll soon die miserably. Call me when you’re ready. What brings you here at night? I came to make sure you’re well. Go to the master Jeong at daybreak. We must bury my father in the right place. The land of 2 generations of kings? I’ll move my father’s grave there to maintain our family’s status. He said, it is already useless. What do you mean? Where’s Jeong? Who did this? Please help me, sir. Who was here! It was Heung-seon, sir. Help me, please. I know you told Heung-seon of the master Jeong’s house! Tell me! Where is Heung-seon? Where is that bastard now? Tell me! Tell me all the rest of Kim’s ancestors’ graves. If only the dead could talk. How would I know where Kim hid his ancestors? Tell me! Think this will bring back your dead wife and child? You want to die right here? As Kim’s treason that defiled the royal court began with you I’ll kill you so it never happens again! You think killing me will stop another like Kim Jwa-geun from rising? Though people die, the land remains forever. It will eventually make another like Kim Jwa-geun. Don’t blame me but yourself for making your family die! What royal order? Blame the weak king! Why you! Sir Heung-seon! Sir Heung-seon! Sir Heung-seon! Sir Heung-seon! Sir Heung-seon! Our chief… She’s in trouble! Why hello, Heung-seon. What brings you here at this hour? Is there a spectacle here? Yes. It’s worth watching. Remove the straw mat. Isn’t she the chief gisaeng here? Why are you doing this? I caught her yapping to the wrong person. What do you think? Who do you think she’s working for? How would I know, friend? Where’s the master Jeong? If you tell me, I’ll let you live. Or else I’ll cut your throat. I’m not begging to a filthy dog. I’d rather die. I couldn’t avenge my father’s death… That’s all I regret. Chief! Making a spectacle of someone dying? You’re incredible. But still, you went too far. That chief gisaeng, I warned her she’ll die. The land of 2 generations of kings? Where is it? Tell me. 1000 years ago, a temple was built to stop any harm. The strong qi lies dormant till today. A land that can change the king! You’re awakening great change! Will you still do it? Tell me where it is! If you don’t, you’ll die here! What would I get by telling you? When my son becomes king, I’ll give you whatever you want! Heung-seon! At last, someone understands what I want. Wait. Did you plan this from the start? So you brought me in to start a fight between the king and Kim? And made Won-kyeong and Cho-sun die? Did you plan all this? Enough! I never lived like a royal for a day in my life! No more! I’ll have that auspicious land! And I’ll rule the world! Heung-seon… I’ll ask you one last time. Where is the land of 2 generations of kings? Millennium Temple… No! You can’t! Don’t do this, Heung-seon! Your son may become king now, but what about 2 generations after? If you touch that land, the country will be ruined! Millennium Temple of Gaya. It’s in Deoksan, Chungcheong-do. Quiet! It’s far. Aren’t you going? Heung-seon! No! Don’t stand in my way! Sir! Her servant confessed where Heung-seon is! Where is Heung-seon now? I don’t know. If you don’t say, you’ll die. Tell me if you want to live! I don’t know anything. Kill me if you want. 2 generations of kings! He went to Gaya to find it! Gaya Temple… He went there… To Gaya Temple! What should we do with them? Please spare us, sir! If master Park dies, who’ll find that auspicious land? Take them, too! Send all my soldiers to Gaya Temple! Yes, sir! Who cares who is king and the country falls? We must survive, Jae-sang! Is this the land to bring about 2 generations of kings? Bury your family there. Then your descendants will be kings! Have you come to pray? Let’s begin. Rebels! Run! We’re under attack! Rebels! Rebels! Out of my way! Move! If it isn’t my friend, Heung-seon! Is this the auspicious land you spoke of? What do you think? Jeong Man-in, you fool! You know very well this land must not be touched! Of course I do! But they’re fighting to have it! Heung-seon. I must have this land. I’ll let you live as a dog like before, so step aside quietly! Wretched fool! How dare a wretched traitor talk to a royal so! A royal? You’re done living as the blacksheep and want to die? Remove those fools from my sight! Kill everyone one of them! Kill them all! Attack! No! Jae-sang! Stop! No! Let’s leave here! No! No! I order you to stop! If I die, copies of your family’s graves’ map will be revealed. Even the king who knows of this couldn’t touch us, you think I’m afraid of that? Your entire family will pay for treason! You’ll all be stoned to death! Also, your ancestors’ graves will all be dug up! Their heads will all be cut off! They’ll be buried deep in the ground with mice and snakes! I’ll make sure your family will be cursed for generations! But if you step aside here, I’ll let you enjoy everything as before. If you take this land, you’ll become a traitor, too. The king will be dead soon. I’ll decide his gravesite. He doesn’t concern you, right? If that is how we must survive together, so be it. Let’s go! Stop! Jae-sang! Jae-sang! Jae-sang! You can’t! To make your son the king, you’ll burn the temple that protected the country for 1000 years? If not you, your descendants will pay for this great sin! Shut your mouth! Heung-seon… You can be different from them. Look at yourself now! See? How are you any different from the Kim clan? Jae-sang! Jae-sang! No! Shut your mouth. Please Heung-seon. Please? You can’t do this! Enough! Heung-seon… Please… Please! Please don’t be angry. Now, this great land… It belongs to me! Foolish friend… What good is your son being king… After two generations, your family line will die out. It’s a cursed land! You will have 2 generations of kings, sir. With the coffin covered deep with plaster, no one will be able to harm it. Well done. Thank you, sir. I’m your right-hand man, sir. But there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you. Where are your ancestors’ graves? Are they great sites that bring fortune to their descendants? Why do you ask, sir? Well, because… I don’t think they are. Hurry! Take everything! Not there. Pack up here first! Hurry! Jae-sang! Jae-sang! Look! Did you really not know Heung-seon would do that? You thought he was on the king’s side? If you came because you are still angry, there’s not much I can do, but die, sir. Find me the land with greater power than what Heung-seon has. Not just 2 generations, but many! I want land that will bring great power forever! I’ll move my father’s grave there. Then you can repay Heung-seon for doing this to you. A land that will bring more power and riches than a king forever? That’s right. (KIM JWA-GEUN) May I ask something? Why’d you find a gravesite for your worst enemy? How foolish is it to want power even after death? How can they have that without regard for fathers or sons? Fools! You never listened to me before. After losing everything, you finally came to your senses! Oh my! Where do we go now? To find a great site. Not land to bury people, but to save them. A land that will save the world! I want to find land like that. (HEUNG-SEON HAD 2 GENERATIONS OF KINGS, THEN HIS FAMILY LINE DIED OUT) (HEUNG-SEON HAD 2 GENERATIONS OF KINGS, THEN HIS FAMILY LINE DIED OUT) I buried him in the most auspicious site. But since the Japanese and Americans came, our clan has lost much power. I called you here to check just in case. Stop whispering and tell me. Yes, sir. As it is surrounded by twisted trees, we regret to inform you, but we believe this land is cursed, sir. The qi under the mound will have vanished the corpse, sir. The coffin will be gone or the bones will be scattered, sir. -Find anything? -No! Fools! Dig deeper! (THE POWERFUL KIM CLAN’S REIGN ALSO CAME TO AN END) You want a site? Yes, sir. We sold all our homes and land to fight for our country’s independence. We’ll build a military school to train students. We want a great site to build it on. What is the best land to help us achieve our goals? Here. West of Mt. Baekdusan. Isn’t that west Gando? I heard it’s barren with not many inhabitants. The land’s energy is strong. Normal people can’t live there. Though it may seem desolate, it’s has strong power for new prospers. It is the perfect place to train great people to regain our country. Though Joseon has fallen, if you start anew here, it will rise again someday. What good is finding the right site if you don’t have money. And these are land deeds. Sell all these and use the money well. Yong-shik… They’ll regain our lost country. We should help. By the way, they’ll need a new name for the training school. New prospers. Shin-heung. That’s what it means. Shin-heung! We love it, sir! Good. As you strive to achieve, please revive our country again. Subtitles by OnDemandKorea
