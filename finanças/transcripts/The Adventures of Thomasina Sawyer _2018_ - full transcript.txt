Late again. Tom Sawyer! What happened to your beautiful hair? Kept gettin' in the way. You look like a ragamuffin. Your dress seems awfully full. Gotta go, Auntie, boys are waitin'! Thanks, Sidney. Ahoy, mateys! What you got in mind for today, cap'n? Pirates storm the English flagship. That's a whack, let's get movin'! Hey, how come Tom always gets to decide? Ain't it someone else's turn to be captain? You know, like a boy? You feel like walking the plank? Reckon not. Then get in line before I place the black spot on ya. That treasure will be ours, me hearties, or my name ain't Tom Sawyer, Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Boarding party. We attack at dawn. Die! Take arms, jolly chaps, repel them pirate thieves! Hurrah! Woo hoo! We just keep walking, you hear? We should say hello. These fleabag ruffians aren't worth our time. Who you sayin' is ruffians? I'm sayin' you are. I should lick ya for that. Out of my way, we'll be goin' on now. I'll give ya a lickin', sword or no sword. You say much, I will. Much... much. There now. You think you're powerful smart, don't you? Blow me over, you're a girl! And you're a coward and a puff! Fight, fight, fight, fight! Why don't you run along home, girlie girl? Wouldn't wanna make you cry. - That's enough, Alfred! - Hush up, Becky! Besides, I wouldn't fight a girl neither how. Talk like a boy, and you sure look like one too. Get off me! Hey! Stop it, Alfred! I ain't losin' to a girl! I said holler enough. What... was that? Enough! That'll learn ya. Better look who you're foolin' with, Alfred! Ow! Can I help you, young lady? No, sir... I was just... You were what? Nothin', just headed home, sir. Well be off then. Rebecca, get in the house this instant! You lost something, Miss Tom? Hi ya, Muff. Yeah, my dress. I ain't ever known you to wear no dress. It's a new one Aunt Polly made for me. Sid must've been spying on me. Is that right? What's the doc selling now? He calls it painkiller. He teachin' me medicine. That's bully, Muff! Muff! Get one of those special bottles for Miss Polly. That's mighty kind of you... Doctor. Here, this is gonna cure whatever's ailing you. Mm. Come along, Muff. Bye, Doctor. Bye. Oh, don't mind that toppled fence! Oh, this fence here? Hardly even noticed it. Hello there, Thomas in a. Afternoon, Doctor. That's a mighty fine niece you've got there. Mighty fine. Ow, I ain't done nothin'! I found your dress! Sidney, you better watch yourself! You leave Sidney out of this! I should tan you for embarrassin' me in front of the doctor lookin' like that. Since you have already made such a mess of your clothes, you will go back outside and paint that fence! But Auntie, it's the last weekend of summer. I don't care if it's the last weekend of your entire life! You wanna go play? You better start doing what you're told. You hear me? Why don't you get your friends to help? They ain't gonna stop playin' to paint no big old fence. You gotta make 'em wanna do it. Ting a ling ling, to the back of the starboard! Ting a ling ling! Hello, old chum, gotta work, hey? Say, Tom, you don't have to ignore a fella just 'cause you got the bad lot today. Why it's you, Ben, I weren't noticing. Goin' swimmin', don't you wish you could come? No time, gotta get the castle ready before Robin Hood attacks. Why? When's we playin' Robin Hood? Soon as we get this castle wall painted. The cannons are over here and we get the archers to cover the flank. You didn't say nothin' 'bout no war. Ain't tellin' nobody. Whoever paints the fence the mostest gets to be Robin. I wanna be Robin! Then who would I be? You'd be Little John, here, give me that. What are you doin'? Painting the castle for the Robin Hood war. Robin Hood? Who's gonna be Robin? Whoever paints the fence the mostest. Reckon I can still be Robin! Nice and white all over, boys, it's gotta be a real castle. No I painted the most! I did! I did! No you didn't! Yes I did! No, I painted the mostest! What's all the ruckus, no lollygagging, Tom. Aunt Polly's coming, y'all gotta go, run, get, go! You aren't leaving this house 'til this fence is finished, I mean it! All done, Auntie. Coated and re-coated. I never. Let's do something about that hair. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures And guides me by still waters. Why'd we have to come? Everybody hated old Hoss Williams, why we gotta pretend we didn't? Shh! He just didn't know the war was over is all. Tom Sawyer in a church dress, well I ain't never - seen the day. - Hallowed be thy name. You ain't never gonna see another day if you say another word. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. You think all his money's buried in there with him? Maybe, they say old mister spent all his days just counting his gold. Heard he sold his soul to the Devil, now the Devil took him. Who's that man? Who do you mean? That man with Muff, I saw him yesterday. Friend of Muff, I guess. Reckon so. Reckon I'll see you at school tomorrow? Reckon not. Ow! Ow. Tom! What's the matter? Sidney! I forgive you. Everything you've ever done to me. When I'm gone... Mom, Tom's dying! What? Come quick! Tom, what's the matter? Is she... dead? Tom, Tom, stop this nonsense! Auntie, my tooth. What's the matter with your tooth? It's loose, aches awful. Well your tooth might be loose but you're not gonna die over that. Sidney, fetch me the silk thread. No, Auntie, please don't pull it out. Doesn't hurt no more! I don't wanna stay home from school! Oh, you don't? Don't ya? No, Auntie, please! Spying on me, Tom? Hello, Huckleberry. Hello yourself and see how you like it. Say, Huck? What's that dead cat for? To cure warts, of course. Warts? Most folks use spunk water to cure warts. Spunk water? Wouldn't give a durn for spunk water. No school? What a life. Wish I could just sport and swim and have a jolly time. Suits me fine. How do you suppose you're curing warts with a dead cat? Why you take the cat to the graveyard, long after midnight, when a wicked man has just been buried. A devil will come. Maybe two or three. You can't see 'em but you can hear 'em as the wind blows. You say, "Devil on corpse, cat on devil, warts on cat, I'm done with ya!" That'll get rid of just about any wart. I don't know, seems... Don't believe me? Come along. I just might. By Jiminy then. Tonight. Tonight? I reckon old Hoss Williams' ghost'll have a few devils. Unless you're a feared? Feared? T'ain't likely. Bother, I'll be late. Midnight. You'll meow? You meow back. Don't leave me waiting too long. If they catch us we'll both get a lickin'. Won't need a second meow 'fore I'm outta bed. See you tonight. M... I... S... C... - Tom's late. - H... I before E except after C, start again. M I S C H I E... Ms. Dobbins. Tom's late. Why are you late, young lady? It's my tooth, ma'am. It ached awful. My aunt had to pull it out. She wanted to keep me home, took a bit of pleading but she finally let me get to school. And if I talk to your aunt will she validate this story? She won't, Ms. Dobbins. My mom pulled Tom's tooth, sure enough, but I saw her talking to that Huckleberry Finn. This can't be true! A young lady, consorting with that vagrant boy? Who's Huckleberry Finn? An urchin, lives down by the river, doesn't even go to school. Over here. The good book says, "Spare the rod and spoil the child." I will not be moved from the path of righteousness by anyone, boy or girl. Hands. Now get your books and just go take a seat by the new girl. Maybe some of her manners will rub off on you. Doesn't it hurt? Nah. If it ain't Ms. Dobbins' old whipping post? Reckon that's the most exercise you've done since your mom pushed you out of the womb, George. We ain't counting your jaw grinding. Hey, there's Becky. Hey Becky, we haven't met official like, I'm George Harper. Nice to meet you. I'm Glen. Hi. Boys, how can you be so rude in front of royalty? Only a red carpet can suit Queen Becky Thatcher. Forgive their foolishness, your highness. Seem to be pretty high and mighty yourself there, Thomas in a Sawyer, always showing off. Hey, wait up! Meow. Come on, let's go. Reckon them devils'll be around about midnight. You hear that? Gotta be them, the devils! Those ain't no devils. Look, it's the doc and Muff. That's Hoss Williams' body. What is he doin'? That man came by my house. Wish we weren't here. Hey, hey! We're here in the name of science. Not grave robbery. Have some decency. Did you think I'd forget? What? My wife was sick, you could've saved her. If I was white... I help everyone I can. I swore, if it took 100 years, I'd get justice! Muff, Muff! Doc. Doc. This ain't right! Everybody's gonna know it's you. It's your knife, the blood. I suggest you get as far away from this place as you can before they come looking for him. What about Lisbeth and little Betty? I'll take care of them. If you say one word about me... I will slit their throats from ear to ear! Now get! Did he see us? Dunno! If he knows we saw him he'll kill us sure! Gotta keep mum about this, you hear? You gotta swear it, come on! Huck, wait, town's that-a-way! Huckleberry? Hmm? Isn't this Hoss Williams' house? Yeah. He died here, ain't you afraid? That's what we're here for! Gotta make an oath to never ever tell! What do we do? Drop dead swear! On the spirit of a dead man, you see? Hoss' ghost is our witness! Here's some chalk, write the oath. What's it say? Huck and Tom swear to keep mum and hope to drop dead if they ever tell! And Hoss Williams' ghost will haunt them forever and ever... Write it! Now the blood. We say nothin'! Never and forever! Ya talk so much in your sleep! You kept me awake most of the night! What's wrong, mom? There's been a terrible tragedy. They found Doctor Robinson at the graveyard this morning, murdered. Who done 'im in? Muff Potter's knife was laying next to the poor man, rest his soul. Whole town's out hunting for him. Right here in our little town, bloody murder. The doc was always so nice to him and he done that. They find him, they'll hang him, sure. Huck, you hear? Yep, they found Muff's knife, pinned him for the murder. There's talk about hanging. We gotta tell. You drop dead swore! What do you say we go to Jackson's Island and wait 'til this whole thing's over and done? When? First light tomorrow. Maybe. I'll think on it. You better not tell! Hey, Becky. I'll thank you to keep to yourself, Thomas in a Sawyer. Making fun of me? I never wanna speak to you again. Don't care if you never wanna speak to me again, Miss smarty! There. Then we'll both be happy. Yeah, no, I have to agree, it probably is. But Ms. Dobbins, is she just admiring it or something? Whatcha lookin' at? This ain't for no girls. Yuck! Disgusting! Ms. Dobbins! I spilled it! It's all your fault! Shh, shh! Miss Sawyer. We're planning on good behavior today, are we not? Yes ma'am. Even more than most days. Hmm. Children, take out your text books and complete the questions on page 24. What? Who is responsible for this? Elizabeth Hayes? Was it you? Ben Rogers? Who? Rebecca Thatcher? Look at me! Look at me! Did you break into my desk and deface my book? Did you? Did you? I did it! Bend over! Tom? Would you like to come back to my house? Sure, that'd be nice. Come on! What you doing here, Becky? Have you got a shred of respect for your family? Boo! Hiya, Alfred. Get whooped by any girls lately? Let's go! Thank you, ma'am. Tom! Becky! Lordy... never seen nothin' like it. Know what? I hate all these things. Stupid dresses. You don't have to wear 'em. Yes I do, Papa insists I always look like a proper lady. I wish I could just wear whatever I want and act like whatever I want... like you. At least you look nice in 'em. Try this one. Nah, I'd look silly. You're a coward and a puff! I'm gonna give you a lickin'! You look beautiful. Thanks. Come here! Ow, ow! My butt is sore. She hit you so hard. Say, you wanna be best friends? Sure, that'd be nice. We caught him trying to sneak his wife and daughter out of his house. - I didn't do nothin'! - Mr. Potter! Calm yourself. Mr. Potter... Mr. Potter. - Judge, on my life and honor! - Becky. I didn't do nothing, I didn't do nothing! I gotta go! Whatever do you mean? Leavin' town. Take me with you. What? I hate it here! No, it ain't the place for someone like you. Come on, give it to me. Get yourself on board then. Who's that? She's my friend, Becky. She's comin' with us. Your granny! Ain't no city girl setting foot on my boat! She'll be fine, you'll see. Well, if I'm not wanted... She's comin'! You're comin'! City girl's afraid of the river. Becky, come on! Atta girl. Don't need a girl. Tom's a girl. She ain't a girl like... you're a girl. What do you mean? I mean... You mean what? I dunno, let's get. Steady as ya go, skipper. Steady it is, sir. I mean... uh... ma'am... Look, there it is, Jackson's Island! Lower the mainsail! Aye aye. We made it, we're outlaws! Ain't nothin' better than this. No one tellin' us what to do. Pirate's life is the life for me. I haven't heard of woman pirates. Me neither. Ain't as common. They're mostly dressed like men, so no one underestimates 'em or nothin'. But they're the meanest of 'em all. I wouldn't be too good a pirate. Sure you would. Pirates wear the bulliest clothes, gold and silver and diamonds. Ain't got none but these. Soon as we find the treasure you can get anything you like. Pirates don't get whipped by school teachers, right, Tom? Sure enough, pirates do the whipping. You girls ever smoke a pipe? I suppose not. I always wanted to. Could you learn me, Huck? Sure enough. Were you planning on spending the night here, Tom? Of course. Just suck in... and puff out. Well that's easy! If I had known that was all I'd be smoking for years. My daddy's going to be plenty mad if I'm not at the trial tomorrow. Tomorrow? School's canceled, the whole town's gonna be there. Puff out, ya hear? My daddy says, "Justice is color blind." Muff will get his trial just like anyone else in our town. Who's to say Muff did it? Everybody knows. Well, if he did... he'd be powerful sorry. He liked the Doc. "Repentance will save your soul but it won't save you from justice." That's what my daddy says. Here, wanna smoke? Knew it, she's no pirate, just a scared little girl! Cut that out, Huckleberry! Becky ain't done nothin' wrong! Ain't done nothin' right neither! I wanna go home. Aw shucks, baby wants her mommy! I don't have a mommy, shows what you know! Fine, let the crybaby go home to her daddy, then! Look what you've done! What do you want with a girl like that anyway? Thomas in a Sawyer, I want you to take me home right now! At least let me walk you home! Leave me alone, I'm done with this pirate nonsense! Good, don't want you no how! Shut your bazook! Becky's all right! "My daddy says!" Think she's too good for the likes of us! Too good for you, maybe! I... I'm gonna go back to the island. You can come along or not. Don't give a lick. Silence! Order please. Mr. Potter, can you tell us what you were doing in the cemetery on the night in question? We was d-d-digging up a grave. Me and Doc Robinson. He uses them dead bodies to practice his medicine on. I was a medic in the war so he asked me to help. Time was they'd have dragged him out and strung him up. He killed him, sure enough! Hang him! Yeah! Outbursts of this kind will not be tolerated! Continue, Mr. Potter. The doc was just lying there. And my knife was all bloody like. I don't know what happened. That's the God's honest truth. The doc always treated me real good. - Hang him! - Hang him! Quiet down. Silence, order, please. You testified that you were alone in the cemetery with the doctor. Is that correct? Yes, sir. I see. Well, in the absence of any other living witnesses... We must proceed to a verdict. And under the circumstances, Mr. Potter, I have no choice but to move to a... I'm a witness! Tom, what are you doing? Sit down! It's me, sir, Tom Sawyer. I were in the graveyard. I seen it all. Come on up to the witness stand. Now do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. Miss Sawyer. You can call me Tom. Tom? Yes, well, can you tell the court your whereabouts last Monday, around the hour of midnight? I was in the graveyard. Louder, please, don't be afraid, now. I were... I was in the graveyard. Were you anywhere near Mr. Williams' grave? Yes, sir. Near as I am to you. Was anybody with you? Just me and... A dead cat. What is a young lady like you doing at midnight in a graveyard with a dead cat? Getting rid of warts. Three men come upon the grave. Muff Potter... Doc Robinson... and that man there! The man that stabbed the doc! I saw him with my own eyes, Your Honor! Silence! Silence, order in the court! Muff Potter's innocent! You get back here, young lady! Hey, sit down, silence! Traitor! Huck, I'm sorry! Sorry don't wash, why'd you do it? Couldn't let Muff hang and let the real murderer go free! Now he knows we saw him. Only knows I saw him! Didn't mention you, Huck. We made an oath! In blood, you can't break drop dead oaths! We'll die! What can we do? Go back and erase it before it's too late! When's too late? When we're dead! Come on! Wipe it off! Never been madder at anybody in my whole life than I am at you right now, Tom Sawyer! It ain't coming off. Wipe harder! Huck, look... Someone's been here. Upstairs! Who's up there? A map. What do we do? Wait. Huck, I think he's asleep. Huck! So we're going to the caves, Pa? That's his lantern, but I don't feel like it's one of those times, where we could really use... Aunt Polly! Oh I should tan you for scaring the life out of me! Tom, your aunt was awful worried about you. It was mighty brave what you did in court today, Tom. Indeed it was, but I need you to sit down with me and tell me the whole truth about where you were and who you saw that night. That was the whole truth! Your aunt has told me that you are prone to telling colorful stories. Auntie, you believe me, don't ya? Of course, dear. Muff is innocent! Well the sheriff has a search party out looking for the man that you identified, so don't worry we will find him soon. But I already know... Know what, Tom? Nothin'. I know nothin'. Judge, child seems awfully tired. Perhaps we could come and see you in the morning? Of course. It'll keep 'til the morning. Run along now, Tom, off to bed, you hear? Leave these problems to the grown ups. Rebecca! Why didn't you tell him? Nobody ever believes me. I believe you. I know where he went. Then why won't you tell my father? They'll catch him and arrest him. Huck's with him. He's Huck's Pa. They hunt him down, they're likely to shoot Huck. No one in this town cares about him except for me. What are you gonna do? Go find him. He's in danger and it's my fault! When? As soon as the grown ups fall asleep. Rebecca. Your daddy is waiting for you outside. Tom! By jingo, you nearly spooked me to death. I'm going with you. Ha. No how. I brought supplies. They're Alfred's old riding britches, you like them? Lordy, what's this? My daddy's Army saber, reckon we might need a weapon. Ya ain't coming. I wanna be brave like you today! But you hate Huck. He needs help. You darn lost your mind, Becky. Come on. You know these caves, Tom? Been a couple of times, but they've been closed off for a while. Why are they closed off? Hoss' daughter died in there, they say. Lot of folks went in searching for her, didn't come out. You like gum? I should say so. I'll let you chew mine a while but you must give it back. Where did Mr. Willams get all his gold? They say he was a knight, a knight of the Golden Circle. What's that? Confederates who didn't give in to the Yankees. You ever heard of John Wilkes Booth? 'Course I have. He was one. When the North closed in, these knights would steal slabs of gold and hide it. Why? 'Cause when the time is right they can rise again. Tom? There it is! Huck's in there. It's pitch black. I brought a lantern. Maybe we should wait for them to come out? Ain't you a'feared of Hoss' daughter? Sure you're reading it right, Edoda? Just a bat. What's that? A shell Huck left us a trail. Darn, no shells. Must've missed a turn a ways back. Tom? What? A few bats never hurt no one. Becky, wait! Can't just sit there. Shouldn't have let me come. I'm just a silly girl. I didn't say that. It's what you're thinking. Are you gonna get up? You're right, I hate silly girls. You're right. We should've let the grown ups handle this. We're lost and it's my fault. You left me. Looking for a way out. Are we gonna die? Someone will turn up. Oh I swear that child will be the death of me. I don't think she's lying. A murderer on the loose. All the more reason to keep her out of harm's way until we find this fella. I have a search party on patrol, don't worry, we'll find her. Tom, Tom! Tom, Tom! Get out of the house! Tom, get out! Dynamite, get out of the house! Tom, wake up, ya thick head! What in the world happened here? I gotta get Tom! The caves! Stop! Tom's in the caves looking for me! Wait, where's Becky? In the caves too, like as not! Do you think about them much? Don't remember them too well. They both died in the war. My Pa took a bullet. And my Ma, she were a nurse and got powerful sick. I think about my mama all the time. Daddy doesn't talk about her much. Other than that she had to leave to get better and one day she'll be back. Better from what? I don't know. I like to think that she's traveling with the circus. She'll be back one day. Just wait and see. What do you say we try and find a way out of here? On your feet, men, let's move out. Sir! Now just one second! Those caves have been abandoned for years. They could collapse at any time! Sheriff, it's my daughter in there. Whoa. Look. They were here. Don't look down. Where's Huck? Where's Huck? Good question. Ha! You're a brave little girl. Who's this? Becky Thatcher. My daddy's gonna hang you for what you've done. Don't even try kid! Open that bag! Pull out some sticks. Keep moving, men. What the hell was that? Tom, let's go! Ain't worth killin' for! I was a little boy! You took off and left me! But Tom, Tom is my friend! Huck, let's go! - Go on. - We need to go now! Come on, we gotta go! Edoda, come with us! Come on! Hurry, this way! The only way in is blocked. There must be something more you can do. Get a team down here, try to clear it out. In the meantime, Sheriff, you and your men, you search every inch of this hillside! Look for another way in. I'd be lying if I said Thomas in a wasn't a handful. She tormented the old heart out of me. She wasn't bad, so to say. Just giddy and harem scarem. Couldn't get her to comb her hair but she was mighty smart. She was just like her mother. Mischievous. Clever. And the biggest-hearted girl I ever did see. Tom, Tom! Tom, Tom, wake up! Tom, please don't... Tom! Tom... Tom, wake up! If I had it to do over again I would... I would hug her and tell her what a comfort she was to me. Tom. Tom, wake up. Please wake up, please. It's so hard. I'm gonna get us out of here. I promise. Tom? You too, Rebecca. She's back! Did you really mean all them things you said up there? Oh you were here the whole time? I ought to tan you! Sidney, don't tell me you were crying too. Tom. Thanks for taking care of my sister in there. I missed you too, Alfred. Huckleberry, come here for a moment. That was an awfully courageous thing you did. Weren't nothin', ma'am. Huck and me are sorry we didn't tell the truth sooner, Muff. You done right showing up, Miss Tom, you done right. Me and my family will be thanking you for the rest of our lives. It ain't fair, Auntie, everybody else gets to play. You two are heroes and guests of honor, your mommy and daddy would be so proud, Tom! And Huckleberry looks like a proper gentleman. Huck? Huck, brought you some cake. Huckleberry Finn, tell me what's eating ya or I'll lick ya so hard you won't never leave this fort! I don't fit, Tom. Too many blamed rules. Wakin' up same time every morning, washing, combing. It ain't for me. Reckon I might take the raft and head downriver. See the world. Can't you try a little longer? I ain't gonna wear one of them cussed ties as long as I... Can't you ask her to ease up a bit? Let me swim when I want? Maybe smoke a little tobacco? I reckon I know how to get around Auntie. Tom, I gotta show you something. Couldn't leave it all behind. We're rich, Tom! Our little secret. That's bully, Huck! I'm gonna buy a house. I'm gonna buy underwear!
