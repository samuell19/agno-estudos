[suspenseful music] [heavy breathing] [suspenseful music] [animal growls] [deep exhale] [suspenseful music] [moans] [groans] [gun shot] [deep exhale] [music playing] [shaver buzzing] [music playing] You really trust me all alone up there in the woods with this rifle? So you really trust me with my rifle? This ain't about trust, boy. [chuckles] My, man, you put your shit in the back. You got it. Let's get out of here. Yeah. [deep exhale] This is your car? Yeah. Strap up. Gee. We buy all laws around these parts. All right, look, so GPS says we got about six hours. I'll probably try doing like 5 and 1/2, 5. Sounds like you're excited to see Marj, huh? Now this is about you showing off you seen my old girlfriend? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Actually, I wasn't going to come. I haven't seen or talked to Marj in... She's been a minute, man. She always going to get what she wants. [scoffs] She's never getting married and have kids. Yeah, man, you know. Boys, come on, no one in this town is good enough for her, but except for you. Yeah, and nobody's too good for you either. And if you think that, it's your own damn problem. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wow, so that's that melodious voice I've been missing all these evening. This thing is about us, we kicking it right now, right? So like we used to, so. Other than you coming home every couple of Christmases, no one gets a chance to see you, but now you back. Am I? Shit, I don't know, you tell me. I don't know. You know you need? Hey, look, act like it's 20 years ago. That's right, and we have a good ass time, smoke out, shoot these bucks, have a good time. Hey, you know they sell the stuff in stores now, right? You don't have to get it in a plastic baggie anymore. Hey, I grow my own shit. [chuckles] You know what I'm saying? It just feels right to be here. I missed this. It's what I'm talking about, dawg. It's why you got to come home more, man. This is where you're from. You've got to connect with your roots, man. Plus, you can see what we're doing around here nowadays. And what do we do around here, huh? Uh, for me, survive. I hunt, I live, and I survive. Marj says no service when we get to this one point, so she drew this map. [chuckles] She drew this for the rest of the way. What are you, kidding me? Hey, man, figure it out because you navigator. Wait, this is our map? Um, she gave us, so go ahead navigator. [laughs] Or you just saying. [laughs] All right, I'll tell you what, you probably could use a drink. Aha, yeah. No rules. All right. You drive, I'll navigate. [chuckles] OK, it is deserted out here. Like no sign of life anywhere. Hmm. Do you think we passed it? Oh, no, I mean, it's probably somewhere right around up in here. Where? I don't see it. Hey, watch out! Shit! My bad. Fuck. Motherfucker. Scared the shit out of me, man. Where did he go? I don't know. The fuck he doing in the first place? Fuck. Fuck was that? [suspenseful music] Where the hell did he go? Drunk motherfucker. [animal growling] What's that shit? Let's get out of here. Yeah. [suspenseful music] Yeah. [suspenseful music] Oh, look, she's already outside waiting. Look at you. Marjorie, Marjorie, Marjorie. You look good. [chuckles] Oh my god, hi. Wow. It's been forever. What? Like 3 years, at least? Yeah, I came back to town a couple of years ago, but. Yeah, but he didn't stop and said hi to nobody but, you know. What are you doing now? Stopping by or are you actually here for a while? It's great to see you. Me too. I'm glad you guys found the place. Barely. We found it. I mean, I can't tell you, you didn't give me any hug, loving embrace and all that. Oh my god, shut up. Don't be a jerk. I'm just telling the truth. Did you, Jomar? Come on, let me show you guys the place. Now you want to show me something. Come in. Show me. I'mma come on in. That's what we're going to do. [music playing] So that's the laundry. You guys can throw your disgusting clothes tomorrow after the hunt. You're not coming with us? Uh, no. Well, you guys can do your dumb man stuff. I have a million things actually I need to do here. I have to go into town and restock the woodpile. You chopping wood now. At least, you're not doing any man work, huh. Oh, you got a little six pointer. Oh, no, hey. Physical labor isn't just something men do. Killing is. A bit of an exaggeration. No, give me that axe, I'll chop this whole forest down before you get some started wood by night. [chuckles] Give me a break, Frank. You used to weep playing t-ball. You remember that? Yeah. Yeah. Frank, you're never really good at throwing wood around. Well, at least I know how to throw that wood. Tell him, Marj. You know. I think you should leave the wood chopping up to Marj unless you got a chainsaw. What? Oh, I got a chainsaw. What? Mm-hmm Oh, that's all good things. You're not running hunting buck all day and then chop wood. As a matter of fact, I bet you'll eat my buck by noon. [chuckles] OK, yeah, I'll take those bags. Thank you. So you guys, there are two bedrooms up there. The big one overlooking the lake, obviously, is mine, but you can dig it out for bugs in the other one. Mm-mm, negative, negative, I don't share rooms with grown ass men. However, I will share one with you. Maybe you just sleep in the shed. See that's that bullshit. Step. So how did you end up with this place anyway? Well, I'm just still getting settled, but it's been in my family since my great, great grandfather, or I'm told. It was getting passed down on my dad's side though, so I never knew the place existed until I got a call from the lawyer rambling to me. [exhale] I'm sorry about your dad. Yeah, I'm sorry about your dad. No, I'm not, never knew the guy. But he was good for something at least, right? Yeah, this place is dope. Yeah. You're a lucky lady. I could live forever in a place like this. Man, you're right. I mean, you gave me a tree stands with animals to hunt, peace here too. Yeah, nice living. Tranquility. Hey, Jon, come on, let's check out these rooms. Get started with our day, man. Oh, go put your stuff up. OK [groans] Woo, yeah, small and dry. Well, this is it, huh? Yeah. I guess it's going to be like camp. Yeah, creepy ass camp. I got top bunk. I mean, you're the one who get shanked. Hey, look at this shit, man. What is it? I don't know some little creepy, demonic looking dreamcatcher type shit. Yeah? You think old man Marjorie was into Hocus Pocus? I don't know, I don't like it. I don't like it at all. I've seen stuff like this before. Yeah? Where? I took a class in the mines. I mean, it's not what this is, but yeah, kind of looks like symbols for protection or something. Protection from what? I don't know. Yeah, well, the protection I'mma need is probably from you into the way you've been, man, right? Yeah. Similar places, Frank. Similar places. Yeah. Oh. I forgot that. [deep exhale] Jon. Hey, yo, Jon? [suspenseful music] You good? Jon? [inaudible] yeah, it's... You all right? Yeah. No, yeah, man, I'm good. All right. I'm good. [deep exhale] So why are you here, man? Hmm? Because Marj invited me. I know Marj invited you. I'm saying why you ain't come back any time before now? No, serious, I know Marj would love to hang out with you. You know, didn't even call me, so what's up? Look, man, I'm sorry. I... I got out, I just had to stay away, you know. Come on, Jon, it's a bullshit answer, man. That's weak. That's weak, dawg. What do you want me to say? I want you to talk to me, man. Be real. You still have feelings for Marj, then say so, dawg. I mean, come on, it's me. It isn't like that. Yeah? Yeah. [deep exhale] Hey, well, look man, when you left, Marj was going through it, man. And it's for years, and I was just here to pick up the pieces. It just happened. Yeah, I know. I just want to make sure we good though, man. I get it. We're good. Man? So who needs a banquet beer? Hey, as will appear, I'll take one. I'll take 3. What did I walk in on? Well, old Jon boy here say he going to shoot a big buck tomorrow, so we're going to see what's up with that. Yeah, the big old bucks. Sure, you don't want to come with us, Marj? Hmm, you two in the woods with guns? Yeah, no, I'll pass. You coming? Yeah. Frank? Yeah, I'll be up in a minute. OK. Yeah, OK. Hey, did you shake this up? You know how you get down, Marj. Uh, try and sip. See, just what I do. We going to have some fun now. We going to have some fun. Yeah, catching one more. [music playing] You know, they do make lighters, Frank. This is more fun though. Yeah? It's my fire, my creation. So, Jon, what's, uh, what's been going on with you? Yeah, what's up? Realizing life isn't all you wanted it coming back to your roots? Maybe I wanted to do more of this. Do more of what? Live in a cabin? Die in these creepy ass woods? Yeah, well, speaking of creepiness, what's up with the weird symbols upstairs in the room? Uh, well, I don't know what they were using this place for. I mean, I didn't know my dad or his family. They could have been just using the place for human sacrifice for all I know. What? They look like, I don't know like pagan symbols or something like used for protection. Yeah, well, Jon is an expert on the dominion, so. Protection from what? I don't know. I don't know, witches. You're worried about witches, Jon? I'm just saying. I did a little research on my history of the land when I got the deed. There's a bit of a history. You guys are up for a scary story? No, I don't fuck with scary stories not when I'm in the wood. Fine, I won't tell you. Come on. Come on, tell us. Tell us. What is it? No, I don't want to scare... You know, Frank's delicate. Symbols on the walls, ancient legends stories, that's just a recipe with some bullshit. Look where we at, man. Don't fuck around with that. Come on, come on, what's the story? Tell us the story. OK, so a legend that I heard dates back to the 1800s, which is when the cabin was built. There was some families traveling West looking for a land to homestead. They came by these woods. And the got here, everything was flourishing with life. There were huge trees, all the wildlife you could hunt. But eventually, the respect and appreciation that they had for the land started to fade, and they just went over indulged and expected the area to continue to provide. People were fat and happy. The woods were pissed. The woods? That's wood, pissed. So one day as if a switch had just been flipped, they woke up, right? And all their food had just dried out. And when they went to hunt for more, every animal they caught was hollow, empty, dry, no meat. They basically started to starve. The entire community fell apart. And then one night... You hear that shit? I hear it. It was just like that at night. Creepy strange presence came to visit each one of those settlers. Gave them a choice. They could either stay on the land and have all this abundant food again and continue this life in the woods or die of starvation. Catch was that those who decided to stay were given plenty of food. OK. Human flesh. Come on, come on. And less of life. And so they all just kind of went mad, killing, eating, then killing then eating. Now they're doomed for eternity to wander these woods living off the bodies of others. I'll tell you what, I'mma let y'all two have it. I'll go get another beer. Yeah, fuck that story. [chuckles] How's a man whose not afraid of anything gets scared of scary stories? Yeah. Yeah. I'm really glad you came. I'll be honest, I was a little surprised by the invite. Yeah. Yeah, I kind of stopped thinking about you, I guess, and you kind of just popped back into my head one night. Oh yeah? [chuckles] You've been dreaming about me, Marj? [chuckles] Not so many thing. Weird, I'm not trying to creep you out. It just felt good to see you again. Listen, I'm not going to get in the middle of anything that's going on with you and Frank. There's nothing going with Frank. Not anymore. I've known him since we were kids, I love him. He's comfortable. Comfortable is good. I don't like comfortable. I just can't shake the feeling that I, uh, might want you. Oh, what's that look for? Did I walk in on something? Hey. [chuckles] All right, 5:00 AM is going to come early for me. This has been fun. I'll see you in the morning. All right, big dawg. [suspenseful music] [growls] [alarm ringing] [deep exhale] Dude, you look like shit. I got it, dawg Remember, boys, don't worry, I own these woods. [music playing] Yeah, it's all right, man. Oh yeah. It's all right. All right, I'm counting on you, man. I haven't been out in these kind of woods in 20 years. Come on, grasshopper. Come on. [heavy breathing] It's going to be all right. What's that? Feels good. It's a nice day. It's freezing out here. It's freezing out here, Frank. You a asshole. [laughs] So. Do you even know where we're going? Of course, not. I figured we'd find a nice clearing, set up shop, see what comes by. And what's going to come by? Mainly small animals, birds, rabbits, ducks, but what we want is that big buck. Yeah, I'll be fine with some quiet in a nice day bus. Already? Sure. My god, we just got here, man. Day has just begun. Oh. Shit, here. You taking nowhere, man. Come on, Frank, find us a spot. A spot where I could sit real comfortably, and not do too much. Got one. Come over here. Fuck! Dude, what the fuck it?

The deer going to be shooting at us or what? [groans] [deep exhale] [music playing] [gun shot] Jesus Christ! What? I just... it's just... You thought we were here to hunt? Huh, Jon? It's fine. It's fine. What did you hit? Nothing. The damn cat got away. A cat? Are you fucking kidding me, Frank? Whoa, whoa, whoa, you need to come down. Look, it's a rabbit, man. It's a fucking rabbit.

I missed all this. [music playing] Oh no. Why did she invite us up here, Frank? Man, I don't know. I mean, who knows with that girl, right? I don't know I, just think it's kind of messed up. I mean, I know we're all friends, but inviting your two exes up to a cabin for the weekend together? Yeah, that is some crazy shit, right? But I'm not having a threesome with you, Jon. That's for damn sure. We have something here. Oh, we have something here. What do you got? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop right there. Right there. Right there. Come on. [gun shot] Got his ass, man.

What are you talking about? I killed Frank. [scoffs] OK. Marjorie, I'm serious, I killed him. Out there in the woods, I was... I... I don't know what happened. I was hearing voices that I... I didn't even see it until I pulled the trigger. OK, this show is not funny. Goddamn it, Marjorie, I'm serious. Frank is dead. OK. Well, if you... if you want to let him know he's dead yourself, you can go, he's inside. I don't know what it is about being out in the woods that makes you guys go crazy. You need to pull it together. What? [heavy breathing] [chainsaw buzzing] [music playing] Frank? How? You shot me. This is impossible. And then you ran like a little bitch and you left me. I thought you were dead. I am, damn! What are you talking about? You're right here. Yeah, but not because of you. No, you left me there to die. I was... I was seeing shit. I was hallucinating. I didn't... Are you hallucinating now? Huh? [music playing] [shaky breathing] [wind howling] Hey. Hey. Hey. [wind howling] Hey. [suspenseful music] Oh. I realize it's your first day and stuff, but I kind of thought we'd have a bunch of meat. Grill up. OK, what's going on with you two? Oh, Jon here is a killer. Oh yeah? What did you kill, Jon? It was an accident. It's pretty accurate accident, Jon. What is going on? This isn't funny. You shouldn't have came back. Is that what this is about? Get out of here with that shit. What are you two actually arguing about? Show her. What? Show her your fucking chest. Man, fuck you, I'm not doing that. I killed him, Marj. I killed him. Out there in the woods, I shot him. I shot him right in the chest. I saw him, he was dead right in front of me. He's a murderer. And now he's standing here right in front of us. I don't know. Frank, what happened? It was pretty much what he said. No, he's telling the truth. Oh my god, OK, fuck you. Fuck you both. Fuck me? Fuck both of you. Where are you going? I don't know. Maybe I'll go stay in town for the night. You guys obviously have some shit you need to work out alone. We are telling the truth. No, this was obviously a giant mistake on my part, I should not have brought you guys here. If you want to lose your fucking minds, you can do it on your own. [music playing] I wasn't trying to kill you, Frank. It really happened? Motherfucker, right it happened. What do you remember? How did you get back here? I, uh, I was checking that buck. I must have lost it, kept looking for it. [music playing] When I turn, had your fucking gun aiming at me. [gun shot] You pulled the trigger. And after that? I was on the front porch, Marj just chopping wood. [wind howling] That's what I'm saying, OK? How is that possible? You should have showed her. And say what, Jon? Hey, Marj, Jon shot me through the heart, but no, no, don't overreact, it's OK, because I just got up and I... [whistles] I walked away. She'll think I'm fucking crazy, Jon. [wind howling] It just doesn't make any sense. OK? I mean, none of this does. I can't explain any of this. It couldn't have happened, not this way. We're going back. Back where? To where you killed me, motherfucker. [suspenseful music] Fucks going on, man? Huh? I don't know. You killed me. I didn't kill you, Frank. Who the fuck did that? Huh? You're right here! [heavy breathing] OK, this is a game, right? Or a message. Huh. You and Marj little fucked up stories. Now you got me out here with a hole in my chest, huh? Because you want to get rid of me. I don't know what's going on, Frank. You don't know what's going on, huh? Last night, you and Marj were talking outside. If nothing is going on, then why when I came outside, you two got quiet? Huh? Nothing's going on. You're not going to say a word? Oh, I guess, she said it, she wants you back. And that's cool, Jon, I don't give a fuck. What I care about is you're going to kill me over it? Huh? I don't want to kill you, Frank. No, no, even if you try, you won't get that chance again. [groans] All fucking day you ain't shooting a fucking shot, now you're going to shoot me? You just used your fucking gun. How dare you, son of a bitch? [suspenseful music] [groans] [music playing] [growls] [chuckles] So you kill me, huh? Is that it? I had a feeling you was going to come back. You stabbed me! Hey, it was an accident, Jon. It was an accident, man. No, what you did that was no accident. Who's the killer, huh? Who's the killer, Frank? You're the killer. That's right. [groans] [suspenseful music] Ow. [groans] [gun shot] Bitch! What kind of man kicks another man in the nuts? You asshole. [heavy breathing] Jonny boy? Jonny boy? Come out, come out, wherever you are. This is my turn now. I see something. Yeah. [gun shot] [groans] [suspenseful music] [growls] [groans] [screams] [heavy breathing] Frank. [heavy breathing] [suspenseful music] [groans] Six million ways to die, I choose all of it for you. It's hunting season. [chuckles] Look at you. [gun shot] Son of a... Jon, come out, man. [suspenseful music] Don't make me kill you, Frank. What? Again? Huh? You've always wanted a piece of me, right? Man-to-man. Let's do this the right way. [chanting] Yeah, I always wanted a piece you. [groans] I said fight one-on-one, you shit! [heavy breathing] All right. All right, we got to stop this shit. All right, this is fucking pointless. I know. Shit. [scoffs] [exhale] Fuck, man. I don't want to kill you, Frank. Well, you sure could have fooled me there, Jonny boy. All this that you did to me, looking and cutting my arm off, slitting my throat, you shot me. The fuck are we going to do, man? Huh? I don't know. Oh, it's right here. Shit. I'm sorry about your arm. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry about all the shit I did to you too. Yeah. I guess I can't beat you one-on-one no more, huh? You could barely beat me before. One point? Barely beat you? Oh one point. Take me lose my arm for you to win, man, I guess. [chuckles] How are we going to explain this to Marj? No, how are you going to explain this to, Marj? You started this shit. You saw how she took it the first time. It's on you, bro. We should move this body. Yeah. Oh, you got the one... the one in the house of you, so you want to get that. Don't want her stumbling over that shit. How are you going to explain that? [sighs] [suspenseful music] [sniffles] Well, fuck me, you going to give me a hand, huh? No, I'm going to take your whole body. Hey, the fuck is wrong with you, man? You get your own motherfucking body, I got mine. Yeah, seems fair. This ain't no motherfucking game, man. What about those bodies in the woods? [deep exhale] Man, shit, fuck them. Let the animals eat them. [suspenseful music] [deep exhale] Why the hell would you come up here? [exhale] [sniffle] [suspenseful music] [coughs] [groans] [heavy breathing] Hey, you go talk to her, man. I don't want her seeing me like this. Jon? Frank? Go, man. [suspenseful music] [deep exhale] Jon, Jon. Jon. Jon, OK, you're not going to believe this. I tried to go into town, but... but... You're... you're not going to believe me I... Marj, come on, just tell me. [suspenseful music] [sighs] Oh, my... [suspenseful music] Oh my god, what the fuck house? OK. [exhales] Oh my god, what the fuck? How c... I'm suppose... I just kept driving and driving and ending up just right here by this same spot. [sniffles] I couldn't leave. [sobs] Oh my god. Oh my god, what happened to you? Where's Frank? Hey. Oh. OK, OK, OK, what is going on? Come here. Marjorie, what we told you today was the truth. Frank and I have spent the day killing each other over and over again, and we keep coming back alive over and over again. So what are you saying? You guys are fucking zombies? Well, I mean not exactly. [groans] [screams] Oh my god, you killed him. God, you killed No, I know this is freaking you out but it's OK. Fucking killed him. We've done it all day. He told you. Get the fuck away from me. No. All day this was going on all day. Will... will you stop. What are you going to do with a rock? No, no. No. Will you stay... now that was unnecessary. Hey, my arm's missing. Hey, hey. [screams] It's OK. It's OK. See, it's OK. See, you never listen. I told you he was coming back. [heavy breathing] [animal howling] It's OK. [animal howling] This doesn't make any sense. None of it does. Yeah. Like have you noticed anything weird, strange, supernatural stuff bullshit since you've been up here? Well, besides the endless road that won't let us leave? Just calm down, all right? No I'm talking about before we got here, any time you came before? No. I just, I got here for the first time a few days ago. It was the first time I'd come here. OK, OK, OK. What about the symbols on the walls upstairs, you know anything about that? No, I'm just as confused as you guys are, OK? Like literally all those I was just going to throw them away. No, that's bullshit there. [scoffs] All the stories you were telling and all that nonsense, because it seems like me and this man are the one that's paying for whatever the price is what's going on around here. Will you cut it out, Frank? This isn't her fault. Oh my god, you're so fucking real. Yo, I'm not convinced, man. I've been here before, man. What are you talking about? No, not physically, but like you know how my dreams are real and she was there. What? Yeah. We were in the woods. These woods with you. What? You're not the only one that's been having nightmares. Give us a minute, Marj. Frank? Yeah. You know something. Get out of my face, go. Stop it! What? What the hell, Frank? Are you serious right now? You're not just a little bit suspicious? Huh? Suspicious of what? Oh my god. All day you've been asking, why did she bring us up here from the ride up, just us? Huh? Who brought us up here? Whose cabin is it? Hers. Who owns that damn forest? Her and her people. What else am I supposed to think? [whispers] You're supposed to think, OK? And not start accusing people of things that you know nothing about. [indistinct whispers] Know nothing about, huh? What don't I know, huh? What do you know, because... [interposing voices] Stop it, that's enough. Go away! Can somebody please get me some water? Yeah. [deep exhale] All right, Marj, all bullshit aside, shit! What the fuck is going on, huh? Why did you bring me and him up here? I don't know what you're talking about, Frank. You know the fuck I'm talking about. Get away from me! No, fuck that. Get the fuck away from me. Cut it out. No, no, no, explain. We're just trying to figure this thing out, OK? Something about this place is causing this to happen. Yeah. I shot a little rabbit out there, just hopping around. But when I got to it, no meat. No meat. Just fur and bonds like in that story. All right, what... what... Remember, that story you told? What does that have to do with me? The fact that... Marj, we just thought that you know about it. You know this place, its history. Whatever came for those people in that story, it's come for us. Obviously, it's coming at the motherfucking us, but everything's OK with you, but this is your cabin, right? This is your forest, right? Look, the same shit is happening to me, OK? I tried to get out of here, to drive out of here and I just kept driving and driving around in circles. Look, whatever's happening here, it's happening to all of us. That is bullshit. You're trying to spin us around in circles. Fuck off. OK, will you knock it off, Frank? No, you knock it off. You know what? I will. You know what I would do, I'm out. You two motherfuckers can have it. Best thing you said was to get up out here, so I'm going to the little merry go round of yours, and get the fuck off this thing. You're not going alone. Yeah, whatever. Catch me if you can. We're getting out of here together. Whatever is happening here, it's happening to all of us. Come on, let's go. [wood creaking] [keys clinking] Give me the keys, Frank. I got it, man. Frank, you got one arm is what you got. Fuck off me, man. Shit. Fuck. All right, how the fuck we get out of here, Marj? Keep going, then turn right. See, that's some bullshit. See, we up out of here, man. No, there look. You gotta be fucking kidding me. It's not going to let us go. No, fuck that. What... what the hell are you doing, Frank? I'm getting us the fuck out of here. I don't think going faster is going to help. It's right in front of us. Do you see it? What? See it? What? [screams] Damn it, Frank, what the fuck? Did you see it? Did you see it? It was right in front of us. You saw it? You saw it? What? It was right in front of us. [heavy breathing] You saw it, right? No. [heavy breathing] Can we go back now? I think we already are. [growls] [screams] We're stuck. [music playing] What are we supposed to do? I don't know. You don't? Come on, I came up here just the same as you guys. OK, just because I know about that creepy legend doesn't mean it has anything to do with me. Are you sure about that? [music playing] Maybe we should burn it all down. Like the whole damn thing on a fire, the cabin, the woods. I have a feeling it's not going to let that happen. [rumbling] You feel it too, don't you? Yeah, I do. I think whatever it is it's... It's becoming part of us. It's... it's changing us. I kept having these dreams of Frank and you. Yeah. Yeah, I had them too. I think they led me here to you. Frank, what the fuck? Don't worry he'll be back. I know he'll be back. Dude, this isn't funny, you can't just keep doing this. How do you explain my fucking arm is cut off? All [inaudible] because of you. So yeah, fucking fuck. [groans] Frank, I'll fucking kill you. Get the fuck off me. Get off me. Fucking shit. He's not yours to kill. [suspenseful music] Hey, hey, come here. Get lost. Hey, will you stop and talk? Oh, you can talk to Jon, but you can't even talk to me with all this fucking bullshit going on, you owe me that! Oh, my god, Frank, you need to cut it out with the jealous shit. This isn't about you or us, this is about all of us together as a team getting out of this shit. Oh as a team? No, this is not a team. See, Jon, he's fucked up. Look at me, I'm clearly fucked up, but you, not a scratch on you. So? So we're a team, right? It's time for your initiation. Yeah. You'll come back just like me and Jon. It's just a dying, though it hurts a little bit. See what happens, all right? [growls] Oh, come on, not again. [inaudible] motherfucker. Yeah. I'mma cut your fucking head off put in my chopping cases. [groans] [chainsaw buzzing] That's a good one. [screams] [chainsaw buzzing] [growls] [suspenseful music] Marjorie, look at me. A choice must be made. [heavy breathing] I've missed you, Jon. I've missed you, Jon. Only you. [suspenseful music] [heavy breathing] [moans] [gasps] [chuckles] You're... you're not, Marjorie. I'm the woods, Jon. Each time you kill here, brings me life, just like your seed. Helps restore the natural balance. [heavy breathing] [music playing] What did I tell you? Frank? Who the fuck else you been killing today, Jon? Jesus Christ. Yeah, I don't even think he could help me with this. You OK? I'm a fucking head, Jon. No, I'm not OK. But what did I tell you about her, huh? It's not what you think. Something out there has possessed her, taken her over. That thing I saw out there wasn't Marj. Hey, well, it looks like it's your problem now. Shut up! I mean I would try to help you out there, buddy but I'm trying to wrap my head around this. Well, you used to be like the head of the class? Get up. You shut up! I'm just [inaudible]. But listen... You are not helping. [heavy breathing] Jon, you're going to have to kill her, man. I'm not killing her. We don't even know what will happen if I do. It's sure the only thing we haven't tried, man. Well, listen to me, I'm not killing her. You're such a pussy wet bitch. You know that? I've had enough of this. What are you doing? I mean, what can you do to me now? Right? Yeah. Jon, freak, Jon... Ha! Ha! Jon, come on, man, I'm trying to see what's going on. Jon. [whispers] Come on, look, J, I'm not asking for much, just get me out this damn bag. I want just to get out the bag. [whispers] Jon? Shut up! Jon, come on, man, let me out. I can't see. [heavy breathing] Well, you out of set of eyes or something. Just shut up. [groans] Almost knocked my fucking tooth out. [whispers] [heavy breathing] [screams] Jon. I'm trying to help your punk ass. [whispers] [evil giggles] Where? Jon, Jon. Marjorie. [screams] No, no. Where are we going? Fuck me. The goddamn thing took her. You're an asshole, you know that. Where is she? Behind you. [gasps] Feed us, Jon. Shoot her now, Jon. Quite bullshitting, shoot her now. I'm sorry. [gun shot] [gasps] [evil laugh] [screams] [gasps] It's pointed in the wrong direction. I need you to kill Frank again. He's tasty. [groans] Oh god. Oh. [chocking] [evil laugh] [chuckles] Look at me, Marjorie. Let her go. Let her go. But being in her body feels all so nice. You both know that. [groans] She has a duty to fulfill passed down to her. You... you... you make us come out here. You... you forced us. Oh, no I cannot force, I can only accept. [groans] Maybe influence a little. [groans] [moans] [laughs] Men are so easy. [chuckles] Do you feel it? [exhales] Life, it's intertwined with death. One needs the other. [shaky breathing] Frank, is almost consumed. Soon the bag limit will be reached, feeding can continue uninterrupted. Hey, Marj. Marj, you want to feed off of me? I'm not much of a meal now, more like a little topping but it's still pretty that Jon. [groans] You were the easiest to lure of them all. Yeah, that's it, Marj. Come here. Oh, my Marj, you always get your way, huh? How about one last kiss, huh? [groans] [screams] Frank, run. Get the fuck out, run. What do you want? [evil laughs] Feed us. Feed us. Feed us. I'm here. [growls] Jon. Jon. Marjorie, is that you? It's you? I'm sorry. It's you. Is that you? Marjorie. Come here. Come here, come on. Come on. Come here. Come here. Shh, It's going to be OK. It's going to be OK. It's going to be OK. We're going to get out of here. We're going to get out of here together, OK? I'm... I'm not getting out of this. Marj, no. No, no, we're going to keep fighting, and we're going to make it, OK? You don't understand. There's no where to go. What? No, no. No, leaving, no. No, no, no, come back. Come back. No, no, no. [sobs] Why'd you go? [sobs] Come back Come back. [sobs] [suspenseful music] [sobs] [sniffles] I have nothing. Nothing for you. You have already given so much. But your last kill is needed. That will free us all, then you will be a part of this land. A protector of it. And when the time comes, your child will be it's inheritor. Because of you, this place will live on. What do you want me to do? We need one more. Kill Frank. He's just a head, what do you want me to do? He must beat fully consumed. [suspenseful music] What? [gasps] [heavy breathing] I don't know what choices I made to bring me here. [sniffles] Or the choices you made. [piano playing] There's only one way out for me. [piano playing] You want one more, here. You reached your bag limit. No! [gun shot] I thought you'd stay. [suspenseful music] Hey. Huh. Jesus! [scoffs] What the fuck are we going to do? I don't know. Driving didn't work. Hmm. Walk? I might have a problem with that there, genius. [chuckles] Yeah, you might. Yeah. Sorry, to have to do this to you, my friend. [groans] Let's go for a walk. Wait, wait, wait, wait, don't leave me. Wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait. Don't leave me. Don't leave us. [piano playing] [engine roaring] [gasps] The car almost hit us. You sure you OK? Yeah. Yeah, you? Yeah. Aye, let me get a shot of that tequila, man. Mmh, hey. [deep exhale] Let me get a shot of that, tequila. [heavy breathing] One more, one more. Woo, you got the cheap shit. Hey. [exhale] [groans] Time has no place here. Try again. They must be fully consumed. Look at you. Marjorie, Marjorie, Marjorie, you look good. [gasps] Hey, Jon? Yeah How I'mma get my body back, man? I don't know, man. I don't know. There's that bullshit. (SINGING) And we were alone on that dark old night. It's no wonder we surrender to this house late at night. Night. And we were alone on that dark old night. It's no wonder we surrender to this house late at night. Night, night. Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
