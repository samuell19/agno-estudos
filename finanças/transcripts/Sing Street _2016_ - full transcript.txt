ROBERT: Oh, let me out of here. ♪ And with a wrench, I'll take you apart... ♪ PENNY: It's my bloody house. ROBERT: Your bloody house? Brilliant.

Many take the boat with barely enough money to survive a few days in London, but still they emigrate because they see hope across the sea, hope they cannot see in Ireland. (TV continues low in background) This meeting has been called to order. Pray proceed. ROBERT: Well, as some of you may have noticed, your mother and I really are under a lot of pressure at the moment. Like the rest of the country. I haven't had a single commission this year. Your mother is down to a three-day week. It doesn't look like it's going to get much brighter. So we had a look at our accounts, and... well, we-we see we could make a significant saving if we altered the education situation. What education situation? - Well... - She means your school. They're taking you out of school. - What? - No, no. We're not taking you out of school. We're transferring you from one school -to another school. - Why? Because we need to make some cuts in the budget somewhere. I'd suggest taking your brother out of college, but he's already dropped out of his own volition. Thank you, Robert. The Christian Brothers have a fine history of education. Who are the Christian Brothers? The Christian Brothers are an educational institution -formed by... - The Christian Brothers, Conor, are an order of the Catholic Church self-appointed in their education formation and systematic beating of their young charges. Oh, shut up, Brendan. Six years in the hands of the Jesuits, and look what they did for you. You're just gonna have to face up to this, Conor. Do you know what the Christian Brothers' motto is? "Viriliter Age." Do you know what that means? "Let's rape our students"? No, Brendan, it doesn't. It means "act manly." FA“ ("Stay Clean" by Motorhead plays) What are you doing? Get out of the bleeding' way. (clamoring) FA“ (laughter) (mumbling in Latin) -(farts) -(laughter) BOYS: Morning, Brother Baxter. BAXTER: Sit down. - French, Brother Barnabas. - Huh? You're teaching French, not Latin. Oh, how modern. Mind you, I'd be surprised if any of you knew where France is, not to mind speaking the language. Oh, go on. It's on the continent. Above Spain. You'll be the new lad, then, from the Jesuits. (laughter) What's your name? Conor Lawlor. - BOYS: Ooh! -Conor Lawlor? - Shut up! Right, Conor. Morning prayers are at quarter to 9:00. The canteen is located just below the PE hall. They serve chips and bars. We have a strict black-shoe policy here, Mr. Lawlor. Your parents should have read it in the introductory rule book, page 142. I don't have black shoes, sir. Well, you're just going to have to get a pair then, aren't you? And report to me first thing in the morning with them. Good man. Brother. As you were. -(door closes) -(laughter) Sorry. Where did he say the restaurant was again? Do you mean the canteen? Of course, the can-canteen, yeah. "The restaurant." You're not in France now, you bleeding' spanner. (school bell ringing) (whistles) Do you smoke? - Do you? - Occasionally. I'm not really a smoker. My brother is. Uh, sometimes steal a bit of his tobacco when my friends are over. So do you want to have a smoke then or...? - Here? -Come on, we'll have a smoke. Come on, follow me. Come on. Here, do you want one? Nah, I'm okay. I already had two this morning. Actually, look at this yoke. It's a Black Widow. Savage. - Now, I hear you're a queer. - What? Yeah, I hear you're a little queer. No, you must have me mixed up with someone else. Nah, I don't think so. Dance. - Dance? - Dance! Dance, like a little queer, go. Are you joking? Jig. Move it. (chuckles) No, more arms. Uh, yeah, disco, kind of. Now dance with your pants down. What? Hmm. Get into that cubicle, dance with your pants down. (clears throat) No. What did you just say? Uh, I'm not, I'm not doing that. DEEJAY (voice-over): It's Thursday. It's 7:00. -It's Top of the Pops. Conor, Brendan, come on, it's 7:00! DEEJAY: They can't be here tonight, as they are in the USA, so instead we have to go to Rio. It's Duran Duran. - Hey, we're working here. -("Rio" by Duran Duran plays) BRENDAN: So are we. This is my homework, Brendan. I have a really important essay due in the morning. Just because you've given up on your dreams doesn't mean we have to, all right? Can we put the fire on? No. You're gonna love this, man. Yes! Beautiful. ("Rio" continues playing) The jury's still out on which way these guys'll go, but they're a lot of fun, and John Taylor is one of the most proficient bass players in the UK at the moment. Gives them a really funky edge, which I hope they're gonna go for. FA“ Hey, it's not exactly the Beatles, is it? Oh, you know, will you go outside and start up the time machine there so we can all go back in time -for Dad, Conor. - Well, if this is the future, we're all screwed, aren't we? I mean, look at this guy. He's not even singing live. BRENDAN: It's a video, Robert. It's art. Everybody's making them these days. Look at it. FA“ He's very attractive, though, isn't he? You're welcome to him. Promise? Who's that guitarist? BRENDAN: John Taylor. All the girls love him. Cute, isn't he, Ann? And he's not a guitarist. - He's a bassist. - Yeah, Ann. I mean, why can't they get them to play live? What are they trying to hide? It's because they're in the USA. Did you not hear him? And this lasts forever. It's the perfect mixture of music and visuals. It's short, to the point. Look at it. I mean, what tyranny could stand up to that? FA“ Good morning, Mr. Lawlor. (school bell ringing) Well, I brought it up with my mum, but she said we can't afford another pair at the moment. I bought these before I knew about the shoe color policy here at Synge Street. But it's not as if they're runners or something. They're... they're brown. They're-they're quite sensible. They're not black. I'm-I'm not sure what you want me to do. Take them off. You can leave them at the door there. Seeing as you're so fond of them, you can pick them up here at 4:00 every day until you comply with the rules of the school. What? See you. FA“ ("I Fought the Law" by The Clash plays) -(laughter) (indistinct conversations) Could I have a Mars bar, please? 25p. Thank you. Here. (boys quiet) BOYS: Ooh! (school bell ringing) -(grunts) '(Clattering) DARREN: You should've just danced. (groans) Who is that psycho? That's Barry Bray. - He'll be out for your blood for the year. -Why? 'Cause you've shown signs of weakness. So how do you know him? He lives in the same flat as me. His ma and da are drugs addicts. But don't worry. You just need to come up with a plan for the year. A solution. Here. Check it out. "Darren Mulvey Business Solutions." Call me anytime. There's no number on it. Oh, no, we don't have a phone. Just call around, yeah? (school bell rings) Who's she? I don't know. She's always there. She's beautiful. Yeah, good luck. She doesn't speak to anyone. Stuck-up cow. She said her boyfriend's a drug dealer. She's not interested in any of the boys in school. Then why is she standing over there every morning, then? Need a light? No. I'm trying to give up. I don't have any matches anyway. So, how come you're not in school? I don't go to school. I'm a model. Cool, like, for magazines? I'm going to London soon. Just waiting for my portfolio shots. There's no real work for models in Dublin, you know? Yeah, tell me about it. Do you want to be in a video? It's for my band. You're in a band? Yes, and we need a girl for it. Have you ever been in a video before? No. Is that a problem? I hope not. I'll ask the producer. Who's the producer? That kid behind me. I could call you with the details, if I had your digits. So, if you're in a band, sing me a song. (chuckles) I can't sing out here. You're gonna have to sing for, like, thousands of people. I'm just one. Sing. Don't make me sing. Jesus. Sing that song off the radio. You know, the one by A-ha. Sing it. (growls): Sing it. ♪ Take... ♪ Sorry. ♪ Take... No, it's too low. ♪ Take on me ♪ ♪ Take me on. ♪ That's all I know. Cool, bye. laughs) FA“ - We need to form a band. - What? (doorbell rings) How are you, Darren? - Is Eamon there? - Eamon? Hey, Eamon. What are you doing? Nothing really. Just feeding me new bunny. Conor, this is Eamon. Eamon, this is Conor. Conor's new in school, and he's putting a band together. Oh, good Jesus. So? CONOR: Wow. Where'd you get all this gear? Me dais 'm a covers band. Weddings, parties, pubs. Eamon can play every instrument known to mankind. Can't you, Eamon? Probably. Show him. Check it. (drums playing) (synthesizer playing) - So what do you think... -(mutters) So, what do you play yourself? I'm more of a singer. I write songs, words, lyrics. But I haven't put them to music yet. What kind of music are yous gonna be doing? Well, I-| don't know yet. What d'you mean you don't know? You have to know what you're gonna be playing. What are you into? I'm a futurist. What does that mean? Like, uh, no nostalgia. Not like your da's band. Not looking backwards, just forwards. Oh, cool. Like Depeche Mode? - Okay. - Or Joy Division? Right. Or Duran Duran? What do you think of them? Jury is out on which way those guys'll go. They're a lot of fun, and James Taylor is one of the most proficient bass players in the UK at the moment, giving them a funky edge. John Taylor. Yeah, John. Of course. I'll be in your band. I'll play guitar. And I'll help write songs. We could rehearse here 'cause my da's in Saint John of Gods. - Is that a pub? - No, Darren. It's a place where alcoholics go to get off the drink, stop beating up their wives and kids. Right. And neighbors. Who's gonna be the manager? Me. Have you managed bands before? No, I'm just breaking into the market. EAMON: Got to get everything straight. Get everything down on paper first. Otherwise, the major record labels can rip you off when they come hunting. - That's what me da says. -(scoffs) When'd you want to rehearse? Not at the weekends. He's got a job packing shelves in Quinnsworth on Saturdays. You're not giving that up for any band, d'you hear me? Yeah. What about Mondays and Wednesdays after school? That's fine. Sounds good. Now all we need is other musicians. Do yous know any? - No. - Eamon? He usually just plays on his own. Don't you, love? Right, well, we can't get any peace in here. Let's continue this meeting outside. No smoking now. Ma, how many times do I have to tell you? I don't smoke. There's a black guy in 3B. So? - Be cool if he was in the band. - Why? He's probably the one black guy in the whole school. Probably in Dublin. Having a golliwog in the band give us a real edge. You can't say "golliwog." Why not? Trust me, you just can't. And anyway, what if he can't play anything? He'll be able to play something; he's black. ("Waiting for a Train" by Flash & the Pan plays) - Wow. - Can I help you? Is this the house where the colored lad lives? Four doors down. What do you think? How many black people do you think that lives on this shitty estate? - Do you know Ngig? - What's that? N9i9- My son. We're putting a band together. Does he play any instruments? Why don't you ask him yourself? (slowly): We are putting a band together. I am the manager. What the hell is wrong with him? Oh, you, um, sound different from your mam. Course I do; been here half me bleeding' life. What'd you think? Would you have any interest in playing in a band? What kind of music are yous playing? We're not a hundred percent sure yet, but do you play any instruments? Maybe. "Futurist band forming. Looking for a bass player, drummer." That's us. "Influences include Depeche Mode, Duran Duran and many more." - Faggots. - Piss off, Ryan. "Contact Management Solutions, 361 at St. Theresa's Gardens. No telephone, just call in." Sounds like a gig for us. Let's go. So what are we called, then? All right, what about... The Rabbits? What's the story with you and rabbits? I don't know, I just love them. What about La Vie? What's that mean? It's French for "The Life." What's French for, uh, "That's not gonna be the name of the band"? (Test nes pas le nom du groupe. There you go. What about... Sing Street? Do you actually not get that like? Sing Street. - Oh! - I like that. - Gobshites. - Yeah, I like it.

I'm just letting the stink of that out, man. Whew. That was bad, bad music. And there is nothing as bad in this world as bad music. - You know you can record over tapes? -No. That was a novelty act. You want to have actual sexual intercourse, right? - Yeah. What, what? - The girl. It's all about the girl, isn't it? - Yeah, the girl, yeah. - And you're gonna use somebody else's art to get her? Are you kidding? We're just starting. We need to learn how to play. Did the Sex Pistols know how to play? You don't need to know how to play. Who are you? Steely Dan? You need to learn how not to play, Conor. That's the trick. That's rock and roll. And that takes practice. And you're not a covers band, by the way. - Really? - No. Every school has a covers band. Every pub has a covers band. Every wedding has a covers band. And every covers band has a middle-aged member who'll never know whether they could've made it in the music industry or not because they never had the balls to write a song for someone else. Rock and roll is a risk. You risk being ridiculed. But I don't know how to write a song. Close that door and sit down. - Really? -It's gonna be a long night. I've school in the morning. This is school. CONOR: "She's standing on the corner "like an angel in disguise. "I want to try and warn her. She's got dangerous eyes." "Dangerous eyes." I like that. What does it mean? I don't know. What's the song about, Conor? It's like when you don't know someone, they're more interesting. (voice-over): They can be anything you want them to be. EAMON: Yeah. But when you know them, there's limits to them. No, that doesn't make any sense. What's it called? "The Riddle of the Model." So what about a rhythm like this? (playing quick chord progression) Nice. Slow it down a little. (playing slower) Yeah. Yeah, that's cool, that's it. ♪ Standing on the corner ♪ ♪ Like an angel in disguise ♪ ♪ I wanna try and warn her ♪ ♪ She's got dangerous eyes. ♪ I've an idea. Maybe for the chorus, like, a...

Yeah, everyone. - Like, the drums -will do a... (drumming) - Yeah. No, yeah. We-we all stop. - Fireworks and lights and shit.

Oh, that's the song; I mentioned it to you. Oh, you're the kid in the band. Yeah, you should probably learn the lyrics. So you can lip-sync to them properly. We're shooting at the lane at the back of Quinnsworth. - You know Quinnsworth? - Yeah. This Saturday at 12:00. Cool. Well, I'll try and make it. What would I wear? I don't know. It's kind of like a Chinese theme. So, like, a kimono? Well, it's more like a riff than a song. (humming) More of an Eastern bit in the song. It's called "The Riddle of the Model." That's really sweet. (chuckles): Oh. No, it's not about you. It's about another model I know. Oh. Right, well, I'll give it a listen, but I'm, like, really, really busy at the moment. You know, so I'll try. Yeah, you should. It's a, it's a good song. We've got a great team. It's a really good opportunity. Cool. So this Saturday at 12:00, then? 12:00. Sounds good. - Thanks. - Cool. Bye. (chuckles) Looks like loads of gear back home, doesn't it? And yet, strangely, it just looks like shit here. -(sputters) - Yeah. Ah, hey, where is this chick? I don't know. Who the hell brought a cowboy costume? Me. It's all I could find. No one wears a cowboy costume in a band. There's a cowboy in the Village People. And Adam Ant. Adam Ant is a highwayman. So we can have a highwayman, but we can't have a cowboy? Are you mentally ill? I got fangs in the joke shop. - What are you gonna do with them? -(growling) It's a music video, -not a bleedin' horror film. - Spanner. So what did yous bring? (laughter) It's me da's show band outfit. So it's a gay band? 0Kay)'- Coming from the one who wants to look like the Village People. What's gay about the Village People? Hello, all. Sorry I'm late. I was out last night. At a nightclub. Jesus Christ, what are you all wearing? Yeah, we're just working that out. Um, maybe you can help. Well, who's your costume person? We don't really have a costume person. Well, who's your cameraman? Maybe he can make some of this work. Well, we don't really have... I'm the cameraman. Thought you were the producer. And the cameraman. Saving money at all costs, yeah. What'd you think of the song? I really liked it. It's the only reason I'm here. Did you write it? Eamon wrote most of the music. So you wrote the lyrics? Cool. You've got really good cheekbones. - What? - Yeah. Yeah, you should let me do your makeup. - Really? -Yeah. Now this light's gonna be really harsh on camera. It'll take the edge off. I'm actually wearing some right now. In fact, you should all be wearing makeup. DARREN: Yeah, I'm not wearing any makeup. RAPHINA: Relax, you're not even in the band. Yeah, thank God. I'm in the band, and I will not be wearing any makeup. Thank you. Why? You've got great lips. No, piss off. I'm not wearing makeup. Whatever. Those of you who actually care about the band and want to do this half properly, queue over there. Okay, so we're playing over here, and Raphina's standing over there against the wall. I go up to you and start singing to you. Make sure to pan up to her eyes when I sing the line, "She's got dangerous eyes." I think a zoom would be better. Okay, a zoom, whatever. Do you think I should have, like, lightning flashes on my eyelids when I close 'em? Can you do that? I can do anything. Cool. So then for the chorus, you walk off and I follow, circling you like when he's following her in the "Thriller" video. - Have you seen the "Thriller" video? -Yeah. Cool. So then I follow you up the laneway, keeping behind you, and then we'll swing around and get the angle in front. - Let's shoot it. - DARREN: Right, let's shoot. It's just some kids filming something. What are yous filming, lads? A video for a band. Hi, Barry. Are these in your school, Barry? Yeah, they are, yeah. But they're wearing bleedin' makeup. BARRY: I know. Oh, yous making a movie, lads, is it? Nah, it's just a video for a band. You should get in a band, Barry. Put on lipstick, dance around and all. - You'd be bleedin' great. - Piss off. - What did you say? - Nothin'. See yous, lads. See yous at the Oscars. DARREN: Right, lads, lots of energy in this.

Yeah. Though we're probably moving. My parents are broke. That's why they sent me to that school. Yeah, I was wondering about that. You're a bit posh for around there. Speak for yourself. Your house is massive. Is it? My parents are probably splitting up. That's sad. Are you doing okay with it? Oh, yeah. It's a bit intense being around them. Jesus, all that drama.

(car approaching) (horn honks, music playing) -(tires screech) - Hey, baby! Hi. - This is Evan Adams. - Word. - How do you do? - This is the singer in the band I was telling you about. Oh, yeah, she played me your song. Good vibes. Little bit of Duran Duran in there, bit of New Romance. What style would you say you were? I'm a futurist. Epic. See you in the future, then. (chuckles) - Ready, baby? - Yeah. - Okay. - I'll see you soon. See you. ("Paperlate" by Genesis plays) (engine revving) Let's make another video sometime.

You just need some proper cameras and a good director. But as long as it's in your head, that's what counts. It's an exercise in imagination. Think big, Conor. This is just a means to an end. And she looks amazing. She's got to be in all the videos. - Yeah? - Oh, yeah. She's world-class. Without her, you're just a bunch of gay-looking kids down an alleyway. Have you kissed her yet? - No way. - Why not? She's a year older than me. And, anyway, she's got a boyfriend. - Ah. Who? - Evan Adams. He's, like, a full-grown man. He's got a car and all and stubble. What's he doing hanging out with a kid? She's not really like a kid. Hmm. - What's this? - Homework. You're good. Get better. How d'you know he's her boyfriend anyway? It seemed like it. Pulled off in his car, music blaring. He's pretty cool. What was he listening to? Genesis. He will not be a problem. - Really? - Trust me. No woman can truly love a man who listens to Phil Collins. (distant thump) Shh. Listen. (Penny and Robert shouting in distance) (distant thump) I think she's having an affair. What? Why? She gets a lift home from her boss a couple of times a week. She doesn't drive. What's wrong with that? She gets out of the car about 100 yards away from the house. It's a nervous thing. She's overcompensating. (groans) Good night, then. (doorbell rings) (clears throat) Hey, Conor, what's going on? I don't know. What are you doing? Just, just rabbit stuff. D'you want to write a new song? Yes, I do. Records. Really good records. - My brother loves this. -(rock music playing) He says it's homework. You see how bass guitar and the bass pedal are playing the same rhythm? You'll hear it now, wait. I told all of yous, you especially, shitting on the bed all the time.

Head down to the toilet and remove the makeup right now. - Why? - Because I told you to. But I'm in a band. It's a school band, and I think it's important that we have a look. You're a man. Men don't wear makeup. But why not? People in the 18th century wore makeup. That means people like Mozart wore makeup, and he was a man. So you're Mozart now, are you? That makes me Salieri, is it? Who's Salieri? You've a fine face. Pretty enough without makeup. Take it off. You can use my bathroom, if you like. Come on in here. (water running) I'm gonna go to class now. Jesus! (grunting) You can't do this! Do you want to bet? (groaning) (grunts) I'll get you clean, don't worry. Clean you all up. Get all that shite off you. Take pride in your God-given features. (gurgling) No more Ziggy Stardust. (panting) (crying softly) FA“ - Hey, Cosmo. - Who? Cosmo. That's what I'm calling you now. You're gonna need a catchy name if you're gonna be in a band. Right. What happened? Nothing. Come on. I really liked your song. It made me cry. Oh. I'm really sorry. No, that's a good thing. So who's the guy with the car? Evan?
