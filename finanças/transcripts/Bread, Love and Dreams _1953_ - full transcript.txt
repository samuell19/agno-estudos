THE STORY WE WILL NARRATE IS FICTIONAL. IT'S HOWEVER A HUMAN EVENT. THE CHARACTERS EXPERIENCE IT AS CARABINIERI, BUT THEY DON'T STOP BEING MEN. THEY FEEL, THEY LOVE AND SUFFER, JUST AS ALL OF YOU. WHEN HUMANITY TRANSCENDS THE LIMITS OF DISCIPLINARY NORMS, CARABINIERI KNOW HOW TO BEHAVE AS IT IS IN THEIR TRADITION. A LUMINOUS HERITAGE OF THE CARABINIERI FORCES. - Brigadier Squinzi, outgoing. - Marshal Carotenuto. My pleasure. - Vice-Brigadier Bolognini. - Marshal Carotenuto. Private Sampieri Giuseppe, reconfirmed. Marshal Carotenuto. My pleasure. Foot soldier Baiocchi, reconfirmed. - What did you do before? - Student. - What class? - Elementary school. - But then I continued on my own. - Good. And you? Carabiniere on foot, Stelluti Pietro, not reconfirmed. - And as a civilian? - Farmer. I helped my father. - Bravo! Where is your town? - Up there. You must climb a bit. - Always mountains! - Yes, mountains. - Shall we go? - Let's go. Stelluti. - What is that thing on the suitcase? - It looks like a guitar. A marshal with a guitar must be a good man. They are turning now. 1,200 meters. The high altitude will improve your appetite! - What is the population of Saliena? - About 700, plus the fractions. - What is delinquency like here? - Calm. You won't have problems. Let's hope for the best! I had a hard time in Romagna. - Hard work? - Massacring! But it's a rich land! - Lovely women. - You've been there? - My wife is from there. - Does she like it here? - Very much. - Really? What are you saying? In towns like these, one must act like it's always their honeymoon. There's not much else to do in the evening, they go to bed early here. - When is your wife coming? - I am a bachelor. - The marshal seems angry. - Give it to me! - Yes, he is frowning. - Poor us if he's grumpy. - Good morning, Brigadier. - Hello, Bersagliera. - Do you need some wood? - Ask Caramella. Caramella is our house help. Now she will be yours. Caramella? I like the name. - What a lovely girl! - She is a wild devil. - Harlot? - No, just a bit bold. - Subversive? - No! Poverty puts the devil in her soul. They call her "Frisky the Bersagliera". Frisky the Bersagliera! They're coming. - Bombing? - No, earthquake. This way? - Earthquake? - No, bombing. - Good morning, Marshal. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, Marshal. Good morning. The band is missing! - Who are they looking at? - People always look at you here. - This facilitates investigation. - Right. - Good morning, Marshal. - Good morning. - Where are the living quarters? - Farther up. Here is the major. Good morning. You are the new… - I am the mayor. - My pleasure. - I'll accompany you. - Thank you. You will sleep here tonight. There are no hotels in town. But tomorrow morning we'll leave early and the house will be yours. - Very well. - Would you like a vermouth? Gladly, thank you. - Is she the house help? Caramella? - No, she's my wife. - Excuse me. I am mortified. - Oh, it's nothing! - Marshal Carotenuto. - My pleasure. No, thank you. You need a wife here, or it means trouble. - But at my age… - Don't exaggerate! Giulia, the marshal considers himself too old to marry. - Don't say that. - Very kind of you. You're surely very fortunate with women. You must be a heart-breaker. Right? She's right. - A cigarette? - No, thank you. I used to smoke, but I had to quit. They gossiped in town. - It is an old-fashioned town. - But these are the Middle Ages! - Here's Caramella. - Good evening. - Sit down, Marshal. - Thank you. - She worked part time with us. - Yes, part time. - For me, full time. - As you wish. Annarella! Annarella! For the love of God, Annarella. Hurry! Annarella! - What is it? - Come right away! Is it for Carmela? Did you boil the water? - Yes. It's been ready since last night. - Alright. I'm coming. - Hurry, or she'll give birth. - No. If I don't come, she won't. Let's go. Good morning, Annarella. You got up early this morning! The church clock and I ring at all hours. Let's go. - Is Bersagliera around? - I am on duty. Then I'll look for you. What's the matter? - Where are you going? - I'll be right back. - Finish washing. - I'll be right back! - Did you see a chicken? - I didn't. Did you, Stelluti? - If you find it, arrest it. - Yes. - Where are you going? - Let me by. - Why do you want to pass between us? - It brings good luck. Good luck, but bad luck to us. But if Stelluti agrees… Go on. Thank you. She was looking for you, not a chicken. But you sleep! Don't talk about that girl again. And don't tease me, or we'll argue. You're right. True emotions must be respected. It is a true emotion. I'm madly in love with that girl. But if I say anything, you know what will happen. I will be transferred. I don't want that because if I leave, I will do something foolish. - So I must behave properly. - Listen… Does Bersagliera realize that you… - What? - That you are in love. - Yes, she does. - Does she agree? I don't know. She is strange sometimes I have to wait another 20 months. I must wait 3 years. I've a girlfriend in Val d'Aosta. Duty! Only duty! That is the life of a Carabiniere. Are you going to confession? I'd like to be your confessor. - Do you have the ribbons? - For you, I have everything. - Come. - Wait. I don't have refined stuff here, but if you come after Mass, I'll get it in the storage room for you. - Stop it. Show me the ribbons. - I'd give you the whole store. Come later. I'll show you a fabric… - Silent, or your wife will beat you. - You make me die. So die! Then we'll have a nice funeral for you. Watch out. I'm going hunting today. Coming? Wasn't the slap I gave you the other day enough? National cigarettes. - Give it to me. - No, it's mine. - National cigarettes, please. - I understood. Just a moment. Darn! - Good-day, Marshal. - Good-day. I'm the woman who brings wood to the Carabinieri. - "Frisky the Bersagliera." - Yes, it's what they call me. - I want to give you this goldfinch. - For me? Yes. You are alone and it will keep you company. - Thank you. Sampieri! - Take care. Take care. - Yes, sir? - Take it to my room. Yes, sir. Just a moment, parishioners! A warning. The pilgrimage to the Monte Acuto sanctuary will be held this year too. Remember that the pilgrimage is not a picnic. You must go there with a cleansed soul. So you must pass on the soiled soul to the cleansing penance, and wash it with the soap of contrition. You must slam it as you do with clothing on the river rocks, and rinse it with prayer. Lay it out in the sun of Our Lord Jesus Christ, iron it with the good iron promises, and give it the right crease. Father Emidio even knows how to wash clothes. The marshal smiled at Bersagliera. He likes to kid around. - May I? - Come in. - I am the new commander. - Yes. Come in. - Here is your coffee. - Would you like a cup of coffee? Gladly. I like coffee, too. I brought a Neapolitan coffee-maker with me. A good coffee is always heartening. - Here. - Thank you. It tastes like broth. - I made it with great care. - We'll talk about it later. Go. - Monsignor, I came… - Monsignor to me? - I'm just a poor priest. - Sorry. This isn't my field. - Are you Neapolitan? - Almost. I'm from Sorrento. - It's clear, then. - What? You call everyone "Excellence". Yes… I mean, no. In different ways. Anyway, thanks for your respect and for this visit. - It's my duty. - I know that you're still a bachelor. Yes, I am a bachelor. This town doesn't offer any distractions. It is a peaceful town. No strikes, nobody rebels. - Would you like them to rebel? - No. For what purpose? When I read in the papers that in Puglia, in Sicily the farmers strike to obtain the land, I feel like crying because at least they have a hope. Here, the land already belongs to the farmers. So nothing more can happen. - A town of progress. - Yes, a progress in poverty. I've been the parish priest for over 40 years, and it takes a lot of courage to confess them. We live with the illusion of living. Maybe Providence wants this town to disappear, and we die a little at a time, without realizing it. By the way, reverend… Are there earthquakes here often? I saw the ruins. Each year there's a little quake, but without serious consequences. And every 10, 15 years, there's a nice big quake. How long ago was the last big quake? A long time ago. It will take place this year or the following one. I am leaving. - He thinks my uncle priest is jinxed. - Why? When my uncle was talking, he knocked on wood! Go! - Have a good Sunday. - Have a good Sunday. - What are you eating? - Bread. - What do you eat it with? - Dreams! - Enjoy. - Thank you. - Bersagliera! - Want plums? I picked them for you. - For me? - Yes. - Why for me? - I like you. - Do you have a boyfriend? - I do and I don't. - What does that mean? - You want to know too much. You want to buy them? - Yes. How much? - Whatever you want. - 50 Liras. Alright? - Yes, sir. Here. Let's make it 100! - Take them to the station. - Yes! - Good-day. - Good-day. - Here's the thief! Return the plums! - Watch out how you speak! Give me back the plums! They come from my orchard. - It's what you say. - Of course. I recognize them. - Is fruit branded like sheep? - Thief! There is a thief. Who is it? I won't say it, or they'll arrest me. You see her? You hear her? Thief! - Thief! I feel sick! - Don't get upset! Peppino, I will become ill. May he die! May he die! May he die! May he die! - What do you want? - These are for the marshal. He is out. Come back. He bought them and told me to bring them here. Alright. - What is your name? - Stelluti Pietro, son of Giuseppe. My name is Maria. Maria De Ritis, daughter of Giovanni. It's a pleasure. You don't want it back? I'll get it back… tomorrow. Alright. Tomorrow. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Good-day. - Good-day. - My respects, Mrs. Annarella. - My respects. - Are you going for a walk? - I'm always walking. I assisted a woman giving birth in Selvone. I cover a big area. Yes, but they should give you a means of transportation. Some people offer me a mule. Otherwise I go like this. - A beautiful woman like you… - Forget it. - May I? How long have you been here? - Seven years. - How did you do? - I just did. I feel lonely and lost. Anyone who comes from outside feels like that at first. But it goes away. I'm friendly, but I'm not married. I was born to start a family. - It's your fault. - Apparently. Until he is a marshal, a Carabiniere cannot get married. It would be a sacrifice for his wife! We have a tough life. If I told you about mine, you would not believe it. I had other ideals. I feel I am an artist. I wanted to study music, the mandolin. I pluck the guitar a bit. Having a custom jewelry and perfume store… Instead… Carabiniere. I suffered a lot to become a marshal. Duty, discipline, sun, ice, water, night, stakeouts… My feet have covered many kilometers. The musket belt has calloused my shoulder. I was a watch guard so many hours, that summed up it makes four years! But let's forget it. We are almost there. - I see, unfortunately. - Let's separate. - People will gossip. - You are right. - Thank you for the pleasant company. - I thank you! I hope we have a nice talk soon. - I hope so. - We are the only two outsiders. Right. I already feel very close to you. - I'm glad. - Really? It's nice to brighten a person's day. And I feel very brightened. Goodbye. Goodbye. The marshal declared his love. - What is Annarella doing? - Sighing. - You called for me, Father Emidio? - It's you! Come. Close the door. What other trouble did you get into today? My troubles are many. I know. What about Don Concezio's plums? Answer. He came and protested with me. - Don Concezio steals so much! - Lower your voice. He steals from the municipality, from the poor, from everyone. - He will end up in hell. - But he is shrewd. He'll confess on his death bed, you will absolve him, he'll go to Heaven. I will send him and God will provide in His own way. But poor people are already in hell and remain there because of cursing, stealing and desperation. Come to church. The same old story. People only make the effort of "Mea Culpa" and Gloria Patri". Here. If you must pick fruit, come to my orchard. I will obey you, but you must answer my prayers. I pray for you every day. I mind my own business, but I have a bad reputation. Is it my fault if men like me? If Dad was still here, or if I had an older brother, the gossipers would be silent. Instead… I know. But if there's someone who really loves you, send him to me. I'll tell him you are a good and clean girl. - No! - God bless you! - Caramella! - Yes? What do your fellow townspeople say about the new marshal? - That you seem like a good man. - Thank goodness! - They also say you are likeable. - Who says that? - The people. - Who did you talk to? - The people. - Who are these people? Who should they be? The people! Even the midwife said you were likeable, too. - Did you hear her say that? - Yes. She said it with a voice… "That marshal is very, very likeable." She actually said, "very, very likeable"? Yes, very, very, very, very. She too is very, very, very… - Caramella! - Who is it? - It's me. Will you open? - I'll be right there. - Who is it? - The midwife's house help. What is it? Annarella needs the train schedule. - Certainly. Get it. - Thank you. Good night. - Why did she want? - Annarella sent her for the train schedule. - Where is she going? - To Rome. - Rome? Will she be away long? - Two, three days as usual. - As usual? - She goes to Rome every month. The last time she returned the day before your arrival. - Clear the table. - You're not eating? I'm not hungry. Do you know why Annarella takes this trip to Rome? She is very reserved. She's been here seven years and nobody knows anything about her. I only know that when she returns from her trip, her face is radiant. What do you mean? When a young woman is satisfied, her face is radiant. Her eyes become sweet and her voice becomes calm. I understand. If you'd seen her as my eyes saw her, you'd have lost control. - Meaning? - There are no bathrooms in our town. Annarella is very clean and bathes in a tub. She is a lady! When her house help's sister was sick, I helped her take a bath. So you saw her… Of course I saw her. What beauty! She is a masterpiece of nature! A May rose. She dove and her breasts rose… Soave! A tiny waist and her hips… Two columns! Alright, go to bed. Good night. You are very nervous tonight. Come on. Let's go. Come. You take care of the mule. It is the only wealth we have. If Don Concezio comes, don't let him in. Lock the door tonight and put the table in front of it. Don't worry. I'll pray all night. Saint Anthony must see our troubles. Come on. You should pray to Saint Anthony too, as we do. - All night! - So tomorrow, in the woods, instead of picking strawberries, I'll sleep. Go, and rest assured. - Where are they going? - To the Monte Acuto pilgrimage. - I am so unlucky! - Why? - I arrive and the clients leave. - They'll be back tomorrow. - But I lost a day. - Will you accompany me? - I'll show you my articles. - I don't have money. - We'll reach an agreement. - What agreement? I've nothing. - You are up, I see. - Good morning. - Did you sleep well? - No, terribly. What do you need these paper women for? You're right. - Did she leave? - Yes. - Today her face will become radiant. - Do you want water for your beard? - No. - Shave. You look like an old man. I don't care anymore. - Hello, Bersagliera. - Hello. - I thought you were with the pilgrims. - I must take care of my donkey. - Your donkey is lucky. - Why? - Its mistress is full of beauty. - And even more tragedies. - Did you want me? - No. I must pick something up. May I? Good morning. I came to pick up the fruit basket. - I gave it to your mother. - Excuse me. - Forget it. - Hey! May I tell you something? - Is it long? - No! May I open up to you? Is it true that the Carabiniere's mom is coming to see him? - The one they call "the statue"? - Yes. - Do you like him? - Yes, I do. He never talks. He's like a monk, not a Carabiniere. He likes me and looks at me in a gazed way. - Is it true that his mother… - Yes. She's coming to see her son, and will stay for the festivity. - You know where she's staying? - No. At Father Emidio's house. Her archpriest wrote to him and asked him to find a room for one of his parishioners. - So Father Emidio will host her. - I am glad. Paoletta, the priest's niece, will go crazy. She had a dress made, and you know what people say? - That she will marry the Carabiniere. - Who says it? The people. - It can't be. - Forget that Carabiniere. - I care so much for him. - Remove him from your heart. It can't be. It's just people's gossip! No. I sense weddings like a dog senses a hare. - Excuse me. - Don't make that face. You're the prettiest girl in town. You'll find a husband. Goodbye! Bersagliera! Bersagliera! Your goldfinch sings like a tenor. Lucky him! Caramella, the water to shave! The marshal likes the Bersagliera a lot. - I like her too. - You? She saw me and ran away. She will drive you crazy. You had better forget her. I can't. - Bersagliera! - Who is it? It's me. - Did I scare you? - A little. - I'm sorry. - Forget it. Nobody was at your home. - They're all at the pilgrimage. - Yes, you told me. - Aren't you afraid of being alone? - No. Nobody will steal me. A lovely girl at night, alone… Occasionally turns men into thieves. Have a Carabiniere be my watch guard. - I will do that! - Yes. - I'll give you a watch guard. - Thank you. Oh, God! It's all I needed! - What happened? - Mom's dress! - Get it! - Oh, God! - Easy! - Here it is! Thank you. - Forget it. - You're wet. I'm sorry. Half a bath is good for me. - OK, go. I must dry myself. - Me too. Come on. Go in the woods and dry yourself. In the woods, among the vegetation. What poetry! Take care. - Dry yourself well. - Go in the woods. - I'll send the watch guard tonight. - Thank you. Go away! Come forward! Looking doesn't cost anything. This is a woman's paradise. Buy! Look! On Sunday there's the festivity! Whoever buys a dress from me will find a husband. - Is this one alright? - Perfect for the lady! - No. French school. - What is that? - Scissor tips. - Scissor tips… 200 Liras a meter! Little one! We'll find an agreement. - Who will give me the money? - 200 Liras, madam. Special stuff, from Como. - How much does it cost? - 5,000 Liras. - Give me that dress. - Is it yours? - Yes, I'll buy it. - You're selling the donkey? Very funny, idiot! - Who are you? - Who am I? - The person everyone says. - What do they say? Gossiper! Look at these two… This is a model from Paris. Hold still! Go away! - You're resisting public order? - Mind your own business! - What is it? - Nothing. An argument. - What is it? - They are two devils. Take them to the station. - Hurry. - Right away. When Bersagliera argues, she becomes more beautiful. - She is always beautiful. - What sort of person is she? She gets by. Otherwise, how could she support herself? - Does she get by… with everyone? - With everyone and no one. She is shrewd. It's hard to catch her off guard. And those who have fun don't talk. - Are you sure? - Ask whoever you want. - Hurry! - Right away. How shameful! Two girls making all this fuss over nothing! What will people say? How shameful for this town's respectability! - It's her fault! - Mine? Leave me alone. Don't touch me! - Don't do that. - Silence! - Caramella, leave. - Right away. Let's hear it. Silence! Stelluti, you talk. - I arrived after Baiocchi. - Baiocchi. - They were screaming and fighting. - But I obeyed you right away. - Be truthful. - And you kept insulting her. She insulted me and then insulted you. Me? I didn't notice. - I didn't hear her. - She even tore your jacket! Squealer. She tore my dress. It's the only one I have. - Stelluti, what happened? - She didn't tear it on purpose. When two women fight, nobody can stop them. Honest girls are always wrong. You hear her? You ugly one! I'll wait for you outside. - What did I say? - You'll go home on a stretcher! - Calm down. - I will kill her. - In the security room! - You can't arrest me. I'll detain you and save you from prison. - I don't care about prison. - Take her inside! Tomorrow morning Father Emidio will come and protect his niece. Stelluti, come on! Don't touch me. Don't let this Carabiniere touch me! A daughter of Mary like you should be sweeter. I am kind, but if someone steps on my feet… That's how I am. - Has she calmed down? - No. She's a wild devil. - Call the travelling salesman. - Yes, sir. - Excuse me. - Come. - ID. - Right away. Postal card and sales license. You can go. - You are from Sorrento. - Yes. - I'm from Sorrento too. - Really? - Everything is alright. - Thank you. Maybe we know each other. My father is Ciccillo, the coral vendor. Ciccillo, the coral vendor! I remember very well. I am Marietta Sartori's son. We're related to the Scognamiglios. The furniture factory people? - Rich! - My aunt married a Scognamiglio. I remember your mother, a real lady. Mom was a saint. She raised six children. - Papa… - What? Papa… Dad. - Oh, Dad! - He died when we were little. I joined the forces when I was 17 and now I am nailed down here. - I must stay here four years. - Four? - Four! - I'm sorry. If you look at a woman here, the whole town knows about it. You have to be shrewd here. The townswomen catch on right away. A sign is enough. - You think that? - With that rose button… - There's much to do. - What button? - Bersagliera. - Are you kidding? She is in detention, she can't be touched. Today she is in detention, but tomorrow… She is beautiful. With a 5,000 Lira dress, you can satisfy your whim. - I have white hair. - It's an extra attraction. It's a guarantee of seriousness. - Don Vincenzino, let's meet. - I am at your disposal. You know where to find me. Sir, the turtledove is singing. I once wanted him. Now I don't want him anymore. Who should I give my heart to? I still don't know. Certainly to a betrayer I will never give it again. Certainly to a betrayer I will never give it again. - Did you hear? - What? - The song. - It has nothing to do with me. - You're wrong. She said "betrayer". - To me? - Yes. - I don't believe it. - Then you're stupid. - I don't understand a thing now. She's angry with me. What did I do to her? What does she want from me? - Yeah, what does that devil want? - Don't call her that. Do me that favor. She's just a poor girl. Alright. If you say so… But you must decide. - Speak, write, do something. - I'll write. But hurry, or you'll end up in an insane asylum. - You hear her? - How shining the sun of love is. Have me find someone who cares about me. Have me find the husband who will give me a shining sun, the sun of love. Have me find the husband who will give me a shining sun, the sun of love. - Marshal. - What is it? - One word. - Silence. Just sleep. I can't sleep. It's important. - What is it? - What are you doing there? Open. - Marshal. - Speak softly. - You must take care of the donkey. - Why? The donkey is our only wealth. And it's alone. - Must I keep it company? - No. Have it drink and eat. Send a Carabiniere. They're not doing anything here. Is that why you called me? I remembered the donkey and thought of you. Be careful. If the donkey has a colic attack, you'll pay for it. Send a Carabiniere. My donkey can't suffer because of you. Go on. Go on! - A sleepless night, sir? - I don't go to sleep as chickens do. - Right. You're a rooster. - Forget it. Good night. Sweet dreams, sir. Easy… Drink. Go. Enough. Come on! Here… Enjoy. Come on out. Good morning. Did Father Emidio come back? Yes. Early this morning to say Mass. Go ahead. Come. - I am busy. Hurry. - Promise you won't cause problems. - I have a lot of problems. - Have you gotten over your fury? Yes. Poor people are always wrong, anyway. I didn't say you were wrong. I thought of you. If I'd let you go, who knows what you'd have done. - Am I right? - Yes, you are right. When you see Paoletta, don't look at her. Turn back. - Will you promise that? - Yes, I promise. Good girl. You know I care for you. Thank you. Good morning, Marshal! - Mrs. Annarella. - Good morning. - Welcome back. - I'll send you the train schedule. - Whenever you want. - Thank you. You're welcome. - What a nuisance! - You used to flirt with her! Me? You have too much imagination in this town. - Did you take care of the donkey? - I did. Then I can go? - Take care and let's see each other. - Don't we already see each other? - Where are you going? - Into the woods to pick strawberries. - If I come by, I'll whistle. - Am I a dog? No. It was a way of saying. To say hello. You don't want me to say hello? Yes, do so! - I don't see her. - Wait for her to turn. There she is. I recognize her before you do. You're right. It's her. - Pull the letter out. - It's here. Pull it out! Be brave. - Did you see? - Yes. - What did you do to her? - I don't know. You never know anything. Bersagliera, where are you? Come in. Bersagliera has already gone to the woods. Come. You've walked all night. - Mom, I'm hungry. - Go to sleep. Mom, I am tired. - Go to sleep. Hurry up. - Come. Mom, look. 5,000 Liras. Where did you get it? - It was on the ground. - On the ground! Oh, Saint Anthony! Oh, Jesus, Joseph and Mary! - Mom, what are you doing? - Oh, God, Saint Anthony! Saint Anthony. Did you do that? Miracle! Miracle! Miracle! Miracle! Miracle! - My daughter, look! Miracle! - Are you crazy? My daughter. Saint Anthony performed the miracle. - Look. - Who gave it to you? - Saint Anthony. - Be reasonable. - Don't touch. It's consecrated! - Don't say that. Be reasonable! I am reasoning. Did you hear anything last night? - No. I wasn't there last night. - You weren't? Miracle! Saint Anthony had you sleep away from home on purpose! - Miracle! - What is going on? Saint Anthony performed the miracle! He answered my prayers! - Marshal. - Who is it? - Marshal. - What is it? - Marshal. - What is it? Where are you? At Contrada Le Stalle there's a bit of excitement. - What is it? - Maria Antonia De Ritis. - Bersagliera's mother. - Yes, sir. She said she received a miracle. She says that Saint Anthony gave her 5,000 Liras. Repeat that. Mrs. De Ritis says that thanks to her prayers, Saint Anthony gave her 5,000 Liras. - 5,000 Liras? - Yes, sir. - In 1,000 Lira bills? - No. It's one big bill. Oh! Go back on duty. I'll take care of the miracle. - Yes, sir. - Sampieri! The bicycle! Right away! The marshal is coming! Let me by. Welcome, Marshal, our loveable man! Please. Marshal, you were the hand of Saint Anthony. - Me? - Yes. If you hadn't arrested Bersagliera, how could Saint Anthony get into my home? Kiss him. Saint Anthony will perform a miracle for you too. Kiss him. Women, remember. Don't cause confusion. Don't worry. We'll pray for your soul too. Who came to feed the donkey last night? Someone who cares for you. - Marshal! - My respects, Father Emidio. Miracles are your department. Naturally. Hey, you! Be very careful. I don't want to hear any talk of miracles. Why not? The ecclesiastic authorities decide if it is a miracle. Sure, but Saint Anthony granted me a favor. That is not a miracle. We'll verify if he really granted you a favor. Mom. - Maria Antonia. - Yes, sir? - I came to settle the account. - As you wish. - You made money. - Saint Anthony did it. It's precisely 6,000 Liras between interest rate and capital. 1,000 Liras of capital, 5,000 for interest rate. What are you talking about? I come with the bailiff! - Yeah. You are the boss! - Yes. Come get it! - Come back here or I'll kill you! - Come get it! Here. Take it. Take it. Here! - Catch her! - My gosh! Give me the money. - Leave me alone! - Give me the money! - Peppino! - Come on! - Peppino, I feel sick! - Sit down here. Have him die! Have him die! Have him die! Have him die! Have him die! Have him die! - Bersagliera! - What do you want? Come here. - Here. - What is it? The dress. I know everything. - What do you know? - You found a sucker. What sucker? - Let's not play this big act. - Big act? Watch out how you speak. I put in a good word for you with the marshal. - With who? - My gosh! I told him to give you 5,000 Liras for the dress. And last night he thought up the trick of the miracle. Take that! All this for doing a good deed! I'll show him! What did you do? Nothing. - The 5,000 Lira bill. - I ripped it up. My God! Why? You know who brought the 5,000 Liras to our home? - Who? - The marshal. Oh, God! I don't understand a thing. First Saint Anthony, and now the marshal. Who told you? I know. You're desperate because of that? You should be thankful! - I should even thank him? - Yes. Your mother says that. Be quiet, or you'll make me curse. Don't you see that the marshal is interested in you? - He gave you 5,000 Liras. - Yes, he's interested, that pig! Don't say that. Even a pig can become a husband. - Quiet, or you won't see me again. - Wait. Be reasonable. Reason with Saint Anthony! Saint Anthony, you didn't perform the miracle, but the marshal did. So help me. I must have my daughter marry. Pasquale, come here! We will play a trick on the Bersagliera, but she must not know. - Are there still some strawberries? - Yes. Come in! There's a gift from the Bersagliera. - Where? - Outside. - Is she here? - No, her brother. - What is it? - Get up and say good morning. - Good morning. - The Bersagliera sends them. - Thank you! - Bersagliera picked them for you. - You are as kind as Saint Anthony. - Yes, Saint Anthony. - Now she's at Forca d'Acero woods. - Really? - To pick more. - I'm glad. If you go in the woods and want to help her, she'll be pleased. - If I go in the woods and help her? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Go on. - Say good morning. - Marshal! - What is it? The archpriest says to go to him as soon as possible. - He said that? - Yes, as soon as possible. I must go to Cansurano. I received an urgent telegram. - Tell him I can't go. - You can't. - Tell him I'll go right away. - You'll go right now. - May I? - Come. Come! Sorry to have bothered you. I would've come to you, but tomorrow there's the festivity and Saint Anthony isn't ready. - Heaven forbid! - What are you doing? - Don't you see? - Go away. - Who will think about Saint Anthony? - Me. Go away! To what do I owe the honor of your call? I'll come right to the point. Bersagliera, whom you know very well, is guilty of being the most beautiful and the poorest woman in town. The men make passes at her. But with what intentions? Do you understand? Right. Everyone bad mouths here and insinuate that the girl… - You understand, don't you? - The others… - Last night even my gossiping niece! - Right. - You should've detained her! - What? - Not that poor girl. - Right. - It was a precautionary measure. - And there's something else. - What else? - It's more serious. The mother of one of your Carabinieri is coming. I know, Stelluti. But what's that got to do with it? - I will tell you. - Excuse me. Mrs. Stelluti is coming to visit her son and to meet Bersagliera. - Will she be the house help? - No. Her son wants to marry her. I didn't know, and it was Stelluti's duty to… Stelluti is a good boy. Both because he is shy and because of the Carabinieri regulations, he never said a word to Bersagliera. - Only a few looks. - Regulations don't deal with looks. Especially those that express an honest emotion. I told you all this in a strictly confidential way because you must help me make those youngsters happy. May I count on you? - It is my duty. - Thank you with all my heart. But I must transfer Stelluti right away. It's the regulation. At least wait for the festivity. His mother is arriving. Thank you. - Yes, Marshal? - Come forward. Are you happy to be doing your service here? - Yes, sir. - How long have you been here? - Eight months. - Eight months! In eight months… Forget it. I called you for a special mission. - Yes, sir. - You will go by yourself. - Yes, sir. - You know Forca d'Acero? - Yes, very well. - Go there. - You must search it. - Yes, sir. Don't take the musket belt. Go as if you were taking a walk. - Yes, sir. - Don't be in a hurry. - No, sir. - If you meet up with anyone… Be nonchalant and start talking. - Yes, sir. - Talk a lot. - Yes, sir. - Make conversation with some girl. That way you'll show that you're not on duty. - Is it necessary? - Not really. But if you meet some lovely girl, strike up a conversation, stop her. It's better. Give the impression that you're courting her. - And that's all. - Alright. Then what should I do? What should you do? Hold back as long as you can and… And keep talking, keep talking… - Meanwhile look at who's passing by. - Yes, sir. Look and talk. Talk with the girl. - What if I don't find her? - Patience. - What if I find an old woman? - No, don't stop old women. Otherwise, they'll think you're there to get information. I understand. Thank heavens! Go. Hurry up. Yes, sir. I will report to you this evening. No rush. Good luck. Thank you, sir. You go do some love making too. Marshall! Marshall! Run! - My wife is about to give birth! - Call the midwife! - I need you. - I should help the midwife? No. But the midwife has been kidnapped. - Kidnapped? - Yes, kidnapped. - Good morning, sir. - Where is the midwife? - Inside. - Call her right away. - But she… - Right now! Or I'll report you for kidnapping and armed threat. What are you doing here? - Is he kidnapping you? - Not that I know of. What happened? - Ricuccio's wife… - Is she in labor? Yes. He came to call you and he threatened him with a rifle. - Matteo, are you crazy? - My wife is very delicate. - Yours isn't due yet. - What if it's early? - It won't be born before it's night. - But Ricuccio is an hour from here! If something happens to my wife, I will commit a homicide! Calm down. We'll satisfy both of you. How can she go back and forth? It's impossible. If she allows me, I'll take her. You'll be uncomfortable. No, but it will be a bother for you. - It's a pleasure. - Thank you. - Please. - You are really a good man. - Please. - Thank you. Give me a push. - Am I going too fast? - No, it's fine with me. I am sorry to trouble you like this. It's never been so pleased to be troubled. - What a lovely day! - Yes, a heavenly day. The Marshal is going full speed. - What are they saying? - This is not a telephone. She always sings. Today she's silent. - She's in love. - When is the marshal coming? - He is cautious. - He is shrewd. Who knows how many girls had an appointment with him here. If he doesn't marry my daughter, I will cause a scandal. Let him get here, and he'll hear us. He's coming! Cheers for the marshal! Thank you. - I don't want to keep you here. - I must stay. - Give it to me. - Thank you. - How is Mariuccia? - She's in labor. - Did you prepare the hot water? - Yes. Hurry up! - Please, sit down. - Are you the grandmother? - Yes. - Good! - Here. - Don't bother. - A glass of wine. - Cheers! A boy! A boy, marshal! To your health and Annarella's! You are Annarella's husband! She has a blessed hand. Why don't you have a child? You have white hair and must hurry. Annarella, what is it? It will take two hours! Why do you make people run? - Another two hours? - Is the linen clean? We are simple people, but very clean. Who is it? Come out! I'm not afraid of anyone! Who are you? It's you! - It's me, miss. - I am not a gentleman's daughter. - I have a letter for you. - Have you become a postman? Don't tell me that. This is my letter for you. You don't have a mouth to speak? You should read it. That way, you'll know everything. "Respectful Miss Maria De Ritis." - Then it's not true. - What? I'll tell you later. Let me read. - You have a lovely penmanship. - I do what I can. - But he's not the marshal. - He sends a Carabiniere in his place? - It can't be. - Maybe he was just passing by. - In fact. - And the marshal won't show up. Did you understand? Yes. I understand. Come. Sit down. Keep me company. - Do you have time? - Yes, sir. I have all the time I want. Is it true that your mother is coming? Yes, it's true. I wrote to her because she must meet you. - You wrote that you care for me? - Yes, sir. Don't say "Yes, sir". I am not a marshal. I am not used to talking to you. Have a strawberry! - They are in love. - You dreamed of the marshal! I don't understand a thing anymore. We should stay here for those two? What does the proverb say? "Better an egg today…" You're right. Better a Carabiniere than nothing. So, come on… My mother wrote to the parish priest here and he answered that you are a good girl. My daughter! My daughter with a Carabiniere! - My daughter is dishonored. - Mom… Go home. I'll take care of the Carabiniere who deceived you! Don't listen to her. She is crazy! Mom, what did you do? You want to ruin me? Go away! Stupid. If I don't corner him, he won't marry you. Go away! And you two help her. Go away! Leave me alone! How shameful. How dreary! - Wasn't Bersagliera in agreement? - It's true. My daughter didn't know anything. I swear that before God. May I never see my children again. Come on… Come on. Do you believe her? - Do you believe her? - Yes, I do. Don't cry. I'll tell everything to the marshal tonight. But then I must leave. - You'll forget me. - No. I love you too much. But you'll have to wait 20 months before marrying me. I'd wait for you my whole life. Annarella, hurry! My wife is giving birth! - You are crazy! Want to go to jail? - I have a guns license! - I'll hit you over the head with it! - If my wife dies, I'll kill you all! - I'm coming! - My wife? - There's time. The suitcase. - Annarella, let's go with the horse. Thank God if I don't arrest you for armed threat. - Understand? - Excuse me. Keep it until I return. Come, Annarella. Here… Incredible! You didn't realize that the marshal likes the midwife? I don't give a darn! - I had better get off. - What are you saying? - I'm tiring you out. - I'd reach the sky with you. - Don't exaggerate. - What? You should read my heart. I'm sorry, but I'm illiterate. Yours is a lovely job! Where you go, a life blossoms. Our marshal is a poet! Annarella, when I am near you, I become a different man, the one I wanted to be, but I'm not. - What did you want to be? - I'll tell you the novel of my life. Who knows how many women are in this novel! Yes. There were many, but none like you. - You are the woman of my destiny. - Careful! Annarella, do you know the motto of our armed forces? - No. What is it? - "Faithful in the centuries." That's how I am. Faithful in love. I've always looked for true love but never found it because I had to come here to find it. Destiny! Excuse me. Annarella… Annarella, hurry. You'll think about love later. I'll put you inside! Excuse me. Shining sun, sun of love, have me find who cares for me. Have me find the husband that I want. Shining sun, sun of love. I'd like to speak Italian as you do. And I'd like to speak as you do. - Enough. It's time to go back. - Wait another minute. - I am on duty here. - You're on duty? - Yes, sir. - Stop with "Yes, sir!" Say "Yes"! - Yes. - Bravo! - Give me another little kiss. - Yes, sir. - Done! Done! - Boy? No, a girl. It'll be a boy next time. Drink! - No, thank you. - You're offending me! - Then I'll drink. - Run, Annarella. It's on its way! - Annarella, run! - We're coming. Keep calm. Have you finished? - Annarella, run! - We're coming. - You've practiced! - A Carabiniere's ready for anything. I've become a substitute midwife. Come! - Marshall, run! - Give us a push. Come. - There! - Push. Push! - Push! - Come on! Concettina said the midwife is not your wife. - No. - When are you marrying her? - Who knows. - What? An elderly man like you has a lovely young woman wait? - Elderly? - Marshal! Marshal! Marshal! It's a boy! - Why are you crying? - I'm so happy. Now calm down. Stay calm. Don't start again. No. God gave me this habit and God must take it away. Why did you wait for me? - Oh, please! May we go? - Yes. I'll see you tomorrow. - Thank you. - For what? I did what I could. Thank you. - Mrs. Annarella, please. - I can walk. - I'll be offended, as they say here. - You're right. - Goodbye. - See you tomorrow. Thanks again, sir. Goodbye. - An engine problem? - I turned it off. It's downhill. - What a lovely sunset! - Yes, it's lovely. "It's now the hour that turns back desire in those who sail the sea, and meets the heart." - I've told you everything. - Everything, what? - Don't play with my heart. - I would never do that. - And so? - Let's change the subject. Excuse me. I should have known your heart was elsewhere. You have too much imagination. Then it's not true. You could love me! Annarella, from the day I saw you… Oh, God! Watch out! - Annarella, did you hurt yourself? - No, and you? I am in paradise. - Annarella! Annarella! - Let me go! How will I see you again? Leave me alone, please! Will we meet again? What a day, Caramella! What a day! What are you doing here? Sir, I must talk to you privately. - Don't show up until Monday. - But I… No! Don't talk. I don't know anything. - I don't know. Go away. - But Marshal… Go away. Do me that favor! Who is it? Annarella's house help brought this letter. For me? Go on. "Dear Marshal, your self-denial and the fascination of your words made me lose my mind." "My cold blood is back again. Forget what happened." "Forget me. Neither now or never could I return your sentiment." "Neither now or never could I return your sentiment." "Don't ask me why. The reason of this decision is only mine." "With the greatest and unchanging esteem. Anna." No! It doesn't end here. Don't play with my heart! - You speak to yourself? - Today I did a good deed. - I know. - Know how destiny pays me back? Mocking me. It mocks me, Caramella. It mocks me! - Marshal. - What is it? - My mother would like to meet you. - Very honored, madam. You are blessed! My son is very happy to be with you. - He must leave tomorrow. - I know. It's alright. He'll wait. I'm sorry, but the regulations… He's in my heart. He can't run away. Did you hear? You are very fortunate! I wish you the same happiness. For me, alas… - A pleasure! - Take care. Caramella… Any news? She's been closed in the house for three days. She doesn't want to see anyone and didn't come to Mass this morning. She didn't even hang the laundry! - I don't understand. - I, less than you. Here's the saint. May he perform a miracle for you too. Here is Saint Anthony. - Did you see? - You should've prayed to the saint. This thing must end. - Who is it? - Friends! - Who? - Friends! You? Why? - May I? - Yes, but you shouldn't have. - You forced me. - I forced you? Yes, because you can't fool around with the heart, my dear. I took a step that no other woman had me take. After getting my hopes up, suddenly you say, "Excuse me, but forget it." No, I can't give it up! If I'd written such a letter, what would you have said? "This marshal is a ladies' man!" Or worse. You don't have the right to act like this. - But I'm a woman. It's different. - What? We are all equal. I vote during the elections, and you vote too. I am a marshal and you are a midwife. Certain women privileges ended a while ago, but that's nothing. You've aroused in my heart a true, great passion. I am ready to risk everything for you, and I won't give up! Or are you a swindler? - What do you mean? - If you have another man in Rome… I have my son there. Widow… - Widow? - No. - Separated? - No. - Divorced abroad? - No. It's why I won't marry you. You should have guessed that I had serious reasons to write those things to you after what happened between us. Now you know everything. It's the usual story of the poor seduced and abandoned girl. But I didn't make a scene. I worked, and I work for my son. - All this honors you. - Thank you for the esteem. But now you see why I couldn't? I was wrong in getting your hopes up. It was a moment of weakness. Forgive me. I am not a woman who you can marry. I know. My armed forces forbids it, but I am ready to leave it. - What is going on? - The fireworks are starting. You were right. How stupid of me! Come! - You don't like fireworks? - What will the people say? They'll say that the marshal has gone crazy for the midwife. It's the truth, the honest truth. Let's go, Annarella. Everyone must see we are engaged. The marshal has gone crazy for the midwife. A salute to the marshal! A salute to Bersagliera! THE END
