Bad news. He's definitely escaped. And one guard didn't clock out this morning. Oh, great. I knew this was gonna end in overtime. Thanks, Helen. Okay, everyone, it's official. I haven't got time to read all that. Tell me about Peter Reece. By all accounts, a model inmate. Kept himself to himself. According to the prison governor, Reece is intelligent, manipulative and extremely dangerous. Sounds like my type of guy. Family background? His only living relative is his sister, Elise Reece. Care of the Haydon Farlow Home. It's a foster home, down by the... Yeah, yeah. I know where it is. No-one else? Wife, lover, best friend? Only the sister. I can't trace anyone else. Where did he live before he went inside? - With his parents, ma'am. - What happened to them? He killed them. That's why he was banged up for... For twenty-five years. Okay, obviously not our standard villain. Fruitcake with a brain. Right, Dave, what do you suggest we do? - Get some men to guard the sister. - And? Contact the press. Brief the radio and TV people. Put blocks in all the roads out of the capital. If he gets on the motorway, we'd widen the search by 600 miles. Yeah. Right, I want a house-to-house. And Bill, make sure the guards at the foster home are armed. Yes, ma'am. What you doin' here? My relief's not due till midnight. It's only ten-thirty. Your watch must be up the creek, sunshine. That's the real time. Elise. Ellie! Ssh, don't say anything. - Peter! - It's all right. You're not dreaming. It is me. - But, Peter, how did you...? - Never mind that. All that matters is I've come for you, just as I promised. - But they won't let me out of here. - Oh, yes they will. Now hurry up, pack some clothes. You won't need much. Nine-thirty... That means it's... five-thirty? - Six-thirty? - No. four-thirty a.m.! Hmm? You've spent so long letting your computers do your thinking, you don't know how to add anymore. Byron, listen. You've done nothing but talk about the States ever since we got here. Now enjoy yourself. Please. It's just that Henderson will be chairing that meeting on the mainframe today, and I wish I was there. - I wish... - Ssh. I know. You think it's your baby. Think you should be there. But, Byron, listen. - We're here to enjoy ourselves, okay? - All right, all right. No more talk about home. Who could resist this place? Hasn't stopped raining since we got here, the sheep are friendlier than the people... ... and now we're freezing our butts off in the middle of nowhere. Terrific. We now have an up-to-date report on the recent escape from the Byfield Secure Unit. The man has been identified as Peter Reece. He was serving a twenty-five-year sentence for double homicide. It is believed he's fled the capital, and the public are urged not to approach him as he is armed and extremely dangerous. Please don't get in one of your moods, Peter! You know I don't believe the horrible things they say about you. What's the joke? I was just thinking about us. Remembering silly things, like when you made me that go-kart and the wheels fell off. You never let me forget it. You was convinced I was trying to kill ya. I know you'd never do that. This is better than being in that home, isn't it, princess? Yeah. But they were really quite good to me. I used to go to the cinema all the time. Ah, so you could meet boys there? No! But we'd often end up in this little pub, and I'd have a glass of dry white wine. Terribly chic, just like in the films. Where we're going, we can spend all day drinking vino, with long siestas in the afternoon. - Will it be sunny? - Every day of the year. Oh, I'll love that. Whatever you want, Ellie. So you won't have to hurt any more people, will you, Peter? I hate that. Hey! It's me, Peter! Not some nutter. Right, first things first. The latest... Good morning, ma'am! Yes, sorry. Good morning, everyone. Morning. Right, what have we got? One escaped psychopath, one torched patrol car and three dead police officers. And now, one missing sister. God knows what he could do to her. You must read this. Okay, Reece is highly unstable, but I don't think he'll lay a finger on his sister. Well, not to harm her, anyway. Gets better every minute. Do we know what car he's got? Well, you know he torched the patrol car that he stole? Cut the shit. Do we know what car he's driving? No. Terrific. So, what else do we have? Great. - Hey, sweetie. - Hi. Couldn't find any Doritos or Twinkies or anything. So, you want some? - Chocolate? English junk food? - Yeah. Come on! We're here to see the cathedral, anyway. But I'm hungry. - Hey, have a nice day! - Yeah, sure will. Even the natives are out to get me. Oh, did that nasty man scare you, sweetie? He is kinda big. Come on. - Honey, over here. - Coming. Ah, don't pay any attention to him. Small town, small mentality... Big muscles... Hey, look at this! Hey, don't sound too interested, or I'll think you're starting to enjoy yourself. You know, I thought we bought enough food for the week, but now I'm not so sure. There's plenty of steak in the freezer. Cute. Very cute. Honey, how were they supposed to know you were vegetarian? No! Don't put your shoes on the table. - What? - It's bad luck. - Who says? - My grandmother. So what are we going to have for dinner? Well, when you were buying those tacky little ceramic things for mom and dad, I booked us a quiet little table for two in that restaurant in town. - You didn't? - Mm-hmm. Sweetheart! There's a lot of things about the guy you married you don't even know yet. Yeah? Such as? His almost legendary resourcefulness in a crisis. - Oh, and what are the others? - I'll think of something. - Aw, shit. - Hmm? Oh, just the Ohio State game just started ten minutes ago. Aww, poor baby! Stay in your cars, please! Keep in line. Stay in your cars. Stay in your cars, please. - I'm hungry, Peter. - Shut up! I'm sorry. Come on, this way. - I'm really hungry. - Here, take this. Police checkpoints on every road. Won't need to buy any more fuel. We'll go the nearest village, then just keep walking. - It's not far to the coast. - I'll get some food in the village. Is that all you can think about? Didn't they feed you in that place? Of course they did! Bread and water once a week. "Little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet, eating her curds and whey..." "Along came a spider and sat down beside her... "and chased Miss Muffet away"! Buy whatever you want. But don't talk to anyone. It's not safe for either of us. - When will we be safe? - When we leave the country. Somewhere where it's sunny every day? That's right. Somewhere we can be together. Just nipping out for a burger. Do you want anything? Oh, no thanks, Helen. I actually made myself some sandwiches today. - Cottage cheese and salad. - Well done! Oh, Helen, did you manage to get a recent photograph of Elise Reece? That one Records sent through was no bloody good at all. Well, I expect she's changed quite a bit since she was three-and-a-half. Yeah. No, I was hoping to get one from the foster home, but it looks like Reece got there first. Well, when he broke in, he took all her records. He's totally obsessed with his sister. I don't think he'd want anyone even looking at a photo of her. Oh, what a sicko. Oh, well, keep trying. Erm, school snaps, friends... You know the score. - Right you are. - Oh, and Helen? Get us a cheeseburger. Stuff the diet. Megan. What are you doing? Hubba-hubba, what a babe. You voyeur! I love when you talk French to me, ma chérie! - Get outta here! - Whoo! Whoo! Hey! Hey, look! I'm sorry about this morning. Just wanted to say hello to a fellow American. I'm half Yankee myself, and... Aw, man. I've done it again. What do you want? Well, you see, this morning, when I was working... Ahh, it's a long story. You don't wanna know about it. Please go away. I ain't seen you round here before. I'm a boxer, see, and when you do five miles' roadwork a day, you get used to seeing what's going on around town. Leave me alone! I don't bite! Only in the ring. The two men were detained in connection with the escape of mass murderer, Peter Reece. Detective Inspector Janet Farrell told this programme that it was a regrettable error, and a full statement would be issued later this week. And now, world news. With yesterday's... Hey, I was listening to the news. Get dressed, you ape. I thought you were taking me out for something to eat. I'm worth it, aren't I? Oh, baby. Can't we stay in tonight? It's been a tiring day. And I am in training. What for? The sex Olympics? You'd come first every time. You trying digging up roads all day. I'm training for a championship fight. I'd rather not, thank you. No wonder people keep stopping me, asking me for directions. Look at these stress lines! I look like a damn friggin' Ordnance Survey map. So, one inch equals twenty-five miles, does it? Maybe. Why don't we stay in and charter relatively unknown territory? Unknown? It's written all over your face. Bye, champ. Jackie! All right already, I'll phone for a takeaway. What do you think I am? Cheap? Here's to you. You're the only woman for whom I could miss the entire NBA playoffs, you know. I mean, to your history degree. Thank you. You want any dessert, Dr Megan? Don't tempt fate! I might not get it, you know. Not get it? Well, you did all the work. They have to give it to you now, don't they? You know, I got this idea that your choice of honeymoon hideouts is everything to do with your favourite subject, mediaeval churches. My second-favourite subject. Here's to you, my favourite cynic. That's it. In you come. I've got your bag. Wait there. Come on. - Had enough... - Ssh! I'm gonna check this place out. Wait there. Don't move. This place is gonna be perfect. - Does someone live here? - Yeah, looks like it. Must be out. I like this house. It reminds me of home. They're a couple of foreigners. Byron and Megan Shelanvis. What kind of a name's "Shelanvis"? What kind of name's Byron, come to that? Couple of Yankee Doodles. Rich pickings. I hope they come home soon. Then we can get some sleep. At least his clothes fit me. - You got the key? - Yeah, I got it somewhere. Oh, don't ever let me eat another piece of vegetarian pizza as long as I live. You had to eat the last one, didn't ya? You'll end up looking like a giant corncob, honey. Thank you! Just let me die in peace, please. Do you want me to carry you to the door? No! You'd never make it. - Bye-bye. - How 'bout a cup of coffee? Coffee? You call me a corncob then ask for coffee? It's abuse! What's it gonna be like in twenty-five years? In twenty-five years, I won't have been talking to you for at least ten. I'm never gonna speak to you again, starting right now. Oh, all right. I'll park the car. - You're not going to... - Ssh. No. They're our passport out of here. I won't hurt them. Unless I have to. ♪ Such a golden man ♪ And he said he saw me 'cross the room ♪ So I said to... Honey, I'm home! You must be Byron. As you can see, Megan has already been introduced. Now the formalities are out of the way, let's get straight to the point. - Money on the table. - Look... Byron, just do as he says. Really, Byron. I'd listen to your wife. She's makin' a lot of sense. Please! We're just on honeymoon and we're... You're nothing! Nothing at all. Back, Byron! Or it's bye, Ron! When I said you were nothing, that wasn't strictly true. You can be my meal ticket. Put 'em on. Her as well. Come on, honey, chop-chop! Let... Let my wife go, please. We're on honeymoon... Do you think I'm bloody stupid? Let her go? Where? Straight to hell without passing Go and collecting 200? No. Besides, you'd be lonely. You're not really in a position to request anything, are ya? Now get movin'. There's a nice, cosy loft waitin' for you. Go. Go, go, go! Go! Now, come along, keep walking. You know where the loft is, don't ya? You're on the stairway to heaven, your little love nest in the sky. Over there. I'll save the introductions till later. Come with me, Ellie. Come on. - Keep them covered. - I can't. Course you can. Besides, I always wanted to say, "Keep them covered." Like in a gangster film. Now, Ellie, they are the inmates, and we are the warders. The gun must always be pointed at them. - Sorry. - That's okay. But if they move, kill them. I've cleared the bathroom of any items you might find useful. Now sit down. Sit down! I hope you won't be too uncomfortable. But it is quite cosy up here. And of course, from a security point of view, I feel so much happier locking you up. I know this is a little uncomfortable, but if you behave, I'm sure you'll survive. Who are you? Should I tell ya? Why not? My name's Mr X. I'm the local escaped psychopath. Do I still need this, Peter? Sorry. All right. I'm your local escaped psychopath, Peter X. Now just remember the house rules. No escaping. If you're good, we'll be gone. And you'll be free. Sweet dreams. Keep it. Just in case. But I can't shoot anyone. No. Think of it as a deterrent. Keep it under your pillow. I'll be mother. Inside, I'm sure they put bromide in our tea. Peter, where are we going? Can we really get away...? Hey, we'll be out of this soon. Trust me. You know what I'd really like? More than sipping wine in the sun? What? I'd like to run a little shop. Just be really normal. What type of shop? Oh, I don't know. A bookshop. I've read all the classics. Well, lots, anyway. If you want a bookshop, Ellie, you shall have a bookshop. A chain! Why stint on it? I bet you read a lot in prison. Mostly technical books. But we could stock those as well. You know, I read that paper you wrote. It got published all over the place. The papers thought it was really wacky. A prisoner doing a degree in criminology. Understanding the criminal mind was survival. I learnt to manipulate situations, see what was gonna happen. Without that, I wouldn't be here today. Ow! Byron, it hurts! Ow! - It hurts! - It's not gonna work. That better? Yeah. What are we gonna do? He could do anything to us, he's mad. Yeah. One day, honey, we'll look back on this and laugh. It's not a joke, Byron! You can't solve everything with a joke! It's the only way I can think of not shitting myself with fear. Sorry. I know it wasn't your idea to come here in the first place. Yeah, I'd rather be developing melanoma in Miami. Doesn't matter where you go. This could happen anywhere. What is it? What do you see? Carpet tack. - Can you reach it? - Yeah. Oh! Almost! Here. - Got it. Got it. - Let me see. - Pick the lock. - I'm trying. - This could take some time. - All right. Peter! That was your personalised early morning call, madam. Oh... I'm still tired. I don't think I slept much. I kept having these funny dreams. It's probably the strange bed. It's gonna take me a while to adjust. I've been in the same bed for the past five years. Byron! Byron, I got it. Byron, I got it, come on! Great. What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out? I need a smoke. No matches, of course. Can you get that window open? Byron! You've got to be quiet. They'll hear us. lf this bathroom window opens, then we can climb down from here... Can't climb down from there, it's too far. Honey, it'll be okay. We'll make a rope out of those sheets. Byron, you know I get vertigo! I can't even put the star on the Christmas tree. Honey, it'll be all right. I'll be underneath you the whole time. I'll make sure you don't fall. If I did fall, I'd kill you. Busy day today, princess. Sort things out, get the hell out of here. Shall I take them something to eat? Nah, leave them. They won't starve. Besides, we've more pressing matters to attend to. - Number one... - At your command, sir! - Oh, really? - Oh! I'm gonna get ya! Argh! All play, no work makes Jack a real jerk! Stop it, Peter! Stop it. Hey, I'm sorry. You won't let them take me back to the home, will you, Peter? Whatever happens, you promise? Cross my heart, hope to die. Brownie's honour, dib-dib-dib, dob-dob-dob. It's not funny. I'd rather die than go back there now. Yesterday you said they were good to you in that place. They didn't hurt you, did they? No, they didn't hurt me, but... Well, I couldn't go back there, not now. I promise. I want you to know, Ellie, I just want you to know, everything I've done... I know some of it was wrong. But I did it for you. I did it for you, Ellie, just you. I know. I also know if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have gone to prison. - I was to blame as well. - Oh, of course not. I had to do what I did. They weren't gonna let us stay together. They wanted to keep us apart. It's not wrong, is it, Peter? Us? We're not doing something terrible, are we? No. Just being true to ourselves, that's all. All right. We'll be fine. - Byron. - Okay. Careful. Careful! - Is this strong enough? - Yeah! Yeah, it'll be fine. - Okay. - Okay. - You're all right. - God! Byron, be careful! Byron! Just sit on the ledge. You get used to the altitude. Oh, it's a great day. Byron! Look at that field. I should've brought my golf clubs, you know? - Byron. - Look at that... Some cows in the way, but, you know... - You gotta move your hand now. - All right, all right. - What do I do with my feet? - Just dangle 'em off. Right down here. Yeah, all right. I got ya. Okay, easy. Oh, God. Okay. - All right. Come on. - Coming! Let's stop. Can't run anymore. Oh! We're safe by now, I'm sure. Please. Yeah, maybe we should take a rest. We're bound to be safe by now. You've have thought we'd have seen a car by now. - What day is it today? - Friday. It's a funny way to end a honeymoon. Yeah, hilarious. Oh, shit, that guy's still got our plane tickets. Byron, we'll get new ones at the airport. Anyway, we might be needed to give evidence. Yeah, maybe we shoulda left a note. "Had to leave early due to unforeseen psychopath." Listen! Listen! Hey, come on. Help! Help! My God! Run! - Let's go for the beach. - Okay. All right. Byron! Bring your gun. Come on! Stay close. Byron! Megan! - Where are they? - In there. Okay, when you see his back, distract him from behind this rock, I'll jump him from over there. Byron, are you crazy? They're armed! She won't shoot me, buddy, she's as scared as we are. Come out, you two. I know you're in there. Stop it! Stop it! - Just stop! - Gently does it. One squeeze, and it's goodbye, Byron. - No! - Keep back or I'll fire! - He's down... - Shut the fuck up! Why don't you just kill us and be done with it? You're lucky I'm such a reasonable chap. I could shoot you both now. Why don't you, then? Help him up. Look, you're sixteen with a record as long as your arm. It's gotta stop. I told you the same the last time. Now, look, Tina, we can't just go on ignoring it. We've given you a fair crack of the whip. Are you listenin' to me? - Dave? Can I have a word? - Yes, ma'am. And you, wait here. Yeah, we've, erm, got something at last. Report of a stolen car in this area. And I've just heard back from Forensics. - They say Reece was driving it. - Well, it's a bit isolated there. Yeah, I know. Get on to the local constabulary and organise me a house-to-house. I'm going home. I'm whacked. Thanks, Helen. Okay. Keep me fully briefed. You know where to reach me. Oi! Where do you think you're going? - Call of nature, all right? - All right, all right. Well, you two, I think your abseiling days are over. There's no way I can change these bandages with these things on. Can't you take them off, just for a minute? Please? Please! Well, I suppose I could. How about me helping you, huh? Here, hold this. Ow, God! Let go! Let go... Let go... Ow! Let go. Let... This way, the more Little Miss Yankee dooes, the more it'll hurdy-hurt! Christ. Byron, my dear chap! Where's your spirit? No wonder your lot fared so badly in Vietnam. No balls! Arrivederci. - Are you Freddy? - Could be. What do you want? Been making enquiries. Was told you could help me. - Oh, yeah? How's that, then? - I'm looking for a boat. Yeah? You left it round here someplace, then? Very funny, Freddy. You should be on the stage. Now, there's a thought. I could make a lot of money that way, couldn't I? There are other ways of making some easy money, Freddy. Go on. There's this boat I'm looking for, see. I fancy a little trip across the Channel. No questions asked, no Customs. I'm sure you get my drift. You want me to help you, lad? I'm no sailor, Freddy. Easy money? That what you said? - How much would you want? - Ooh... Now, there's a question. How much is it worth to ya? How much would you think? It's not a long trip, is it? Just me and my friend over there. I can see you haven't been to sea, mate. Nothing's for sure. Not even on a short trip. There again, you would be askin' me to break the law, wouldn't ya? I've a couple of hundred. Cash. Oh, I dunno, lad. Hey! Hey... Whoa, please, please! Don't run away from me again. I'm starting to get this really bad feeling of rejection. Please, you'll have to go. Listen, I only wanna talk. Wanna apologise about the other day. In town, you know. Perhaps you've forgotten me already? I can't think of a reason why you should remember me. No, I remember. - It's just... - Your boyfriend, he's the jealous type? Hey? Your boyfriend, he's the jealous type, right? I can understand why. Oh, you mean Peter? He's not my boyfriend, he's my brother. Oh, I've said too much. Look, you must go. He gets really angry. Listen, I don't scare easy. I told you, I'm a boxer. The new super-middleweight champion of the South West! Well, almost. The fight's in two days. I'm sure you'll do really well. But please go. Please! I hope you don't mind me saying, you are very pretty. I don't mind. But you still must go. Peter's coming back! Not until you promise to see me again. I can't! Well, I won't go, then. - Please! - Nope. All right. All right, but only if you go now. - Who was that? - Nobody. - Just a guy. - Just a guy? You're not behaving like a little tart, are ya? Aren't I enough? I'm just being friendly, that's all. Are we going soon? I'm not in a good mood, Elise. We need more money. Greedy sod wants double what I've got. Are we going back to the house? Can't stay here. Sooner or later somebody's gonna recognise me. But they gave you all their money. There's a way. There must be. Why do you think I kept them alive? Well, aren't you pleased to see me? I need more money. What have you got? - Got any jewels, Megan? - Stop it! - How about your wedding ring? - Stop it, I'll help you. Ellie, Byron's gonna help us. What's the plan, old chap? We have credit cards and a chequebook. So, what are you worth? Couple hundred on each of the cards, and I don't know how much is left in the account. - You don't know? - We just got married. We're not rich. Ellie... you better change Byron's bandage. We don't wanna get blood on the carpet, do we? You know, money really is the root of all evil, isn't it? But it's a small price to pay to be rid of me. You're gonna need our signatures. You'll have to take us to the bank. No, I don't think so. You stay here. You're not looking very well, my friend. Remember, you've lost a lot of blood. Megan can sign. - Let go! - Don't worry. I'll bring her back. You wait here, Ellie, and keep guard. Don't answer the door. Just stay up here with Byron. If the lame cretin tries any amateur heroics, shoot him. Wait there. I don't want him boring you, Ellie. Open wide! You're very hot, old son. I hope you're not ill. I'll bring her back. - Hey, Freddy! - You still here, lad? Not for much longer. My friend here has offered to lend me the money you want. I have a chequebook. How much do you want? Sorry, love, I'm strictly cash up front. We could go to a bank in town and I can get cash there. Look, lad, if you'd heard the forecast, you'd know this weather's about to turn. There's a bloody great storm out there, and it's headin' this way. I don't mind bendin' the rules a bit, but I ain't gonna get drowned doin' it. Look, you said you'd take us. I'll give you all the cash I can. Just get us out of here tomorrow. You come back and see me Monday. Besides, banks have just closed. You won't find no cash round here for a couple of days. Sorry, lad, I can't help the weather. But you're between the devil and the deep blue sea till Monday. I shouldn't go mentionin' your little trip to anyone else round here. They're a God-fearin' lot of folk. You're lucky you found me first. I'll take you across Monday. Thanks. Couldn't watch you suffer like this, I couldn't. Don't tell Peter I helped you, promise me. Yeah, I promise. Look, um... I got a fever, I think this leg is infected. Could you do me a favour? Go in the bathroom, see if there's any alcohol or something and wash it out for me? Please. I promise, I won't tell Peter. Okay. Those pills should help. They're Peter's. Some sort of tranquilisers. He doesn't use them. They send you to sleep. He doesn't know I've got them. You seem scared of him. You know, you could leave any time you want. I couldn't leave him. He's all I've got. But he's dangerous. You must be able to see how unstable he is. He's my brother and I love him. And I don't care what anyone says about him. He's obviously escaped from somewhere. Why should he be here with you? You shouldn't ask me these sort of things. I shouldn't tell you, anyway. Look, I don't mean you any harm. But Peter says the less you know, the better. Knowledge is power, or something. I don't really understand. Now, this will hurt. You should've seen the state I was in when I crashed my go-kart. - When you were a child? - Yeah. That was years ago, but you should've seen the state I was in. Did you have to go to the hospital? Yep. Took them three days to sort me out. But I survived. What are you runnin' from, Ellie? Nothing! I told you not to ask questions. You'll only try to trick me, and... But I'm not gonna trick you. How old are you, anyway? You shouldn't be here. I'm eighteen. Well, nearly. But I tell you, I know more about life than most people my age. Yeah, if you hang around with Peter, I'm not surprised. I hadn't seen him for five years! It's nothing to do with him. You can't blame everything on him. Okay, okay. Don't get excited. I'm sorry. Aren't you feeling any better? Yeah, wonderful. Maybe you're right. I should talk to you. You might go into a coma or something, and then I wouldn't know what to do. What do you want to talk about? I don't know. Do you like books? Yeah. I'm going to own a bookshop. You like reading, then? I love it. In the home, I was good at English and art. An active imagination, that's what they said I had. I was lousy at maths and things like that. Do you like any American authors? Yep, er... Walt Whitman, and John Steinbeck. And Mark Twain. Er... What's your favourite, favourite book? That's easy. Wuthering Heights. I've read it loads of times. That's not an American author, is it? You never said it had to be! You asked me my favourite book, and that's what I told you. Yeah... Well, there's a story like that set around here. There aren't any moors around here. Yeah, I know, but there are cliffs. Megan's doing a degree in history, and she showed me this story. It's an account of a woman whose life comes to a tragic end. Tell me. Well, there's a girl. She's about eighteen. And she's engaged to this guy who promises to come back from the Crusades and marry her. But he's taken prisoner by the Saracens. Go on. She waits for years and years, and gets more and more depressed, and, finally, she figures he's dead and she gives up waiting. Little does she know that he's just escaped and he's on his way home. Well, as he nears the coast, she senses his presence and hears him calling out to her. Now, she thinks that the only way to be with him is to kill herself. And she jumps off a cliff. - Oh, no. - Yeah. Anyway, the next day, he comes home, everybody's happy to see him, but they know they have bad news. Then what? What does he do? I'll tell you tomorrow. No, that's not fair! I tell you what, tomorrow I'll bandage your leg again, and I'll give you some more pills. Okay. Well, he's distraught at this news, and he makes his way up to the cliff from which his fiancée had thrown herself. Oh, it's like a suicide pact. Don't tell me, he throws himself into the sea to be with the one he loves more than life itself. No. On the way, he meets a young, rich widow. They fall in love. He forgets all about jumpin' off the cliff, and two weeks later, they get married. No, he didn't! No, no, that's... That's not romantic. - It never happens like that. - Honest. No way! All right. Yeah, he jumps off the cliff and dies in a mangled heap on the rocks. Satisfied? Peter's back. I'm sorry. It'll be our secret. Byron. Byron, sweetie. Are you okay? Byron! Peter! Peter! Peter! Open the door! He's gonna die! Peter! I'm bloody warning you, I've had enough today. Goddamn it, he needs help. Medical help! I'll just go and get the doctor, shall I? Get him to come round with his portable operating theatre. Oh, and I mustn't forget to remind him to bring anaesthetists and three nurses. He's gonna die! Please. Well, he'll just have to die, then, won't he? Peter! Just call a doctor! I swear I won't say anything. I'll say it was an accident! I don't trust you. Please. But then again, if you were to be good to me, I could be good to you. - What do you mean? - Promise. No! Let go! No! Help! No! No, get off! No! No! No! Get off! Get off! No! No! Stop it! No, stop! Get off! No! No! Have you called the doctor yet? You promised. Meggie, Meggie! Remember the old saying? Never trust a man who screws his own sister. You fucking bastard. Have one on me. She's really good. You okay? Just try and sleep. Wipe your eyes. You look a mess. Come on. Now get rid of him. Say anything, I'll kill you both. Good morning, madam. We're calling on everyone in the area. I wondered if you've seen this man. You see, we don't live here. We're on honeymoon. Haven't seen much of anyone. You're an American, aren't you? I've an ear for accents. Comes in handy in this line of work. Well, if you do see him, do let us know. And whatever you do, don't approach him. He's dangerous. Well, erm... Bye. Very good, Meggie. Should've been an actress. Checked out Nowhere. Nothing to report. Bloody waste of time, if you ask me, Sarge. I'm sad to see you're feeling better! You always have to go and spoil everything, don't ya? Just when I think you've learnt your lesson, you try and trick me again. All right, you're frightened. A couple of snivelling cowards. But did you ever stop to consider me? I'm trapped here, too. I can't bloody go anywhere! - What's the difference? - No! Jesus, you make me sick! I can't even go into town now that bloody photo's been circulated! Hell, I need a drink. They're closing in faster than I thought. Gotta get away soon. At least we'll be together, princess. Yeah, I'm feeling lucky. Get me something to drink. Go into town, get yourself something as well. We might as well use some of their money. We'll have enough. ♪ You and me were meant to be ♪ Hey, Jackie! I'll take you for that meal when I win the title, okay? Piss off. Oh, talk dirty to me, baby! It drives me crazy! Detective Inspector Janet Farrell warned that Reece's unpredictable behaviour could have a tragic effect on his sister Elise, who he abducted from the home where she was being cared for under medical supervision. Her delicate mental state, together with Reece's past record, makes it imperative that anyone with information about the couple... Hey! I like a girl who keeps her promises. And your timing's great, too. I'm just about to take my lunch break. What promise? The promise you made to go out with me. I don't even know your name. - Well, you didn't tell me yours. - Oh, that's easy. I'm Danny. Daniel Sturges III. Long story. And you? - I shouldn't say. I... - Aw, come on, I told you mine. And I'll promise not to tell another living soul, so help me God! I'm Elise. My brother calls me Ellie. Well, Elise, how about we take this lunchtime drink? - I ain't gonna take no for an answer. - I can't. I'm expected back. And your brother wouldn't like it? No! Well, he wouldn't mind, if that's what I wanted. So, do you want to? - Suppose so. - Well, then, that's settled. Let's go. I wouldn't go trying any more tricks like you did this morning. You've only got one leg left, Byron. You don't wanna lose that one, too. We're supposed to be out of here today. The house could be rented to six or seven other people. - Have you thought of that? - Oh, dear... Is your honeymoon over? At least you won't forget it, will you? I tell you what, let's give you something to remind you of the wonderful time you've had here. Something to show the family. I can't quite get the composition right. Oh, yes, that was very good. Ever done any modelling, Byron? That'll be very realistic. I'm hungry. There's plenty of meat in the freezer. And I'm sure you can rustle up something delicious for us all... Meggie. He was in the Air Force, just across the way. He met mom there, got married, moved back to the States, had kids, got bored, got divorced. I mean, she never got over livin' here. So she bought a place in the village, so she could be back to her roots. And I always stayed. But I will go back to the States one day. I'm always boxin', and that's the place to be. Why box, though? It's so cruel. Well, I don't know any better, now, do I? Anyway, I'm good at it. I won the L.A. Golden Gloves when I was eighteen, you know. But when I heard about my mom, I just upped and left. What's the matter? You worried your brother's gonna come in and catch you enjoying yourself? No. Elise, has he ever hurt you? No. Well... Sometimes, if I do stupid things, he'll lose his temper, but I know he does it for my own good. - Who else lives with the two of you? - What? No-one. I know that's not true, Elise. I can't explain! I don't know how. All right, all right. Listen, listen. I'm fightin' for the title tomorrow night, seven-thirty at the town hall. How about you get away from your brother, you come with me, and you be like my lucky mascot, I couldn't lose. - Please. - Oh, I don't know. I'd like to, but I've gotta go back now. It takes half an hour to walk home. Well... - Hey, now. I'll give you a lift. - No, you mustn't! If you're still worried about your damn brother, I'll make sure he doesn't see us. You need my help, you come and see me, okay? Thank you. Hey. - You forgot this. - Oh, thanks again. You will come to my fight tomorrow night? - Yes, seven-thirty, town hall. - Yeah. Reece was imprisoned five years ago for the murder of his parents in what was described at the time as a frenzied attack. The police are concerned for the safety of his sister... I think I got everything. - And there's some nice, fresh bread. - Ssh, ssh. - I would've come back sooner... - Shut up! ...search has brought the police no closer to finding this dangerous fugitive. Now, the latest weather update. - Yes! - The torrential rain, which is... They're losing it. Just a bit longer, and vroom, up and away! ...accompanied by heavy thunderstorms. These should clear by Monday morning, giving a bright start to the week ahead. I told you you could do it without throwin' up. Mmm, all that protein. I could really get you a doctor. We could go up to your honeymoon suite. I might even leave the handcuffs off this time. If I want to have you, I will take you anytime, anywhere I want. Now tell me. Tell me now. Tell me now, or I'll cut your heart out and serve it up to Byron! You can have me. Anytime you want. Anywhere you want. Now cook the dinner. Here. We gotta get outta here. All of us. You're getting better. It'll be all right. How did you meet Megan? What did you think when you first saw her? How did you feel? Well, it was at a party. I was there with somebody else. But, er, our eyes met across the room. You know the drill. But, er, I blushed and looked away. I was too scared to talk to her. Then how did you meet her? Er... She met me, actually. What do you mean? As I said, I was... I was too scared to talk to her, and... finally, she just walked up and asked me to dance. I think what it would've been like, had she observed convention and waited for me to talk to her. I know someone in town. Well, I don't really know him. But I really like him. Well, did you tell him about Peter? Did you tell him what's goin' on around here? Of course I haven't! Don't get excited. It's all right. But what if Peter found out? - You won't tell him? - Mm. No. Our little secret, eh? He wouldn't believe you anyway. Peter really loves me. But it's different somehow with Danny. That's his name. Danny. Oh, I don't know. What a weird kid. Here, let me. I insist. I'll be mom! No meat for me, please. No meat, thank you! Stop! It's your honeymoon! Mmm! Tha's done us right proud, hasn't tha, lass? Hasn't she, Byron? Go on, mate, you tuck in. It's good. She's a vegetarian. Are you sure? Or maybe she just slipped in some rat poison while I wasn't watching? I'm eating it. It's fine. I said I'll just have rice, thank you. You know, it's very bad manners to refuse perfectly good food. There's people in Biafra who'd be glad to eat this. Come here! Sit down. Eat it! Leave her alone, you sick fuck! You didn't mind a bit of meat last night, did ya? You'll make her sick! Did your wife tell you she came on really strong to me last night? Couldn't wait to get me inside her. - Now, you eat that! - No! Or I'll kill your stupid Byron right now! Stop! Stop it, Peter! You come back here this instant, you hear me? Kids, eh? Do love 'em. - Stop! - Just like that, she was. Down on her knees in a shot. Whipped it out before I could say, "Don't mind if I do!" I lost my appetite. Elise. What a waste. But at least there's some coffee on. Would you like a cup, Byron? Only if it's decaffeinated. - Run, Meg! - My face! Aargh! Damn it, come on! No! No! No! Byron! No! Stop! No! Leave her! No! Leave her! No, Peter! Peter, stop! You'll kill her! Don't fucking tell me what to do! Don't ever tell me what to do, or I'll kill you, too. I know you didn't mean that. I didn't, Ellie. I shouldn't have said that. You know how I get. I'd rather die than hurt a hair on your head. Move, and I'll kill you both. Say you'll forgive me. Please, Ellie. I've done all this for you. So we can be together. We'll always be together. Please, princess. Let me in. Only if you promise to be good. I'll be very good. - Morning. - Elise! - Do you like it? - You look beautiful, but... I hope you don't mind. It's all your make-up. - I hope you don't mind me borrowing... - Elise, where are you going? Into town. Peter's still asleep. He drunk loads of vodka last night. I don't expect he'll remember, but he asked me to get him some more. Elise, when you go into town, go to the police. Please? Just tell them what's going on. We need your help, Elise. Please, Elise. For your sake as well as ours. I don't want to think about Peter anymore. He's in here, all the time! I'm going to see Danny. Stay with Danny. Tell him about Peter. Tell him what's going on here! Elise, take this picture. Take it to the police. Just show them. - Elise, please. - I've got to come back. I want to be with Danny, just for a couple of hours. Then I'm coming back. - Take Danny the picture! - Don't come back here, Elise. - Don't come back here! - Elise! It's starting to rain, and I thought... Hey, come on. Come in. I told you, I don't bite. There's some old bag downstairs. Who is she? - How should I know? - She let herself in with a key. Who is she? We were supposed to be outta here yesterday. - Maybe she's the housekeeper. - Housekeeper? Person who cleans the house before the next tenants arrive. Shut up. You'll have to get rid of her. How? What excuse can I make? What do you want me to say, huh? I don't know. You'll think of something. Tell her your car's broken down. Use your imagination. Say we fell in love with the place and decided to handcuff ourselves to the bed. Shut up! Cuff him, come on. - Now give me the key. Quick! - I'm trying. Tell her something believable, or you know what'll happen. - Hello! - Oh! Weren't you supposed to leave yesterday? Oh, sorry I frightened you. - Here, let me help with that. - No, no, no, leave it alone. You start interfering, before I know who I am, I'm out of a job. And I need the money. I've got a disabled husband. Er... Our flight was delayed. We had no place else to say, so we came back here... It's none of my business, but you are breaking your agreement, you know. Why didn't you go and sleep in the, erm... You know... You know, the airport? - The lounge? - Oh, I'll do that in a minute. I've only got one pair of hands, you know. I always work to a routine. Hall, dining room, and then the lounge. Or you could get me into a lot of trouble. I'm not one to nag. We even had trouble with the car, you know. It's a hire car. We never even made it to the airport. It got stuck - in the mud, and then we had to... - Oh, look in here. What's all this on this carpet? It looks like blood. - How did it get here? - My husband hurt his knee. Look, I'll clean it up. In fact, I'll clean up everything. You can go home, come back tomorrow... - I'll have it all cleaned up. - No, no, no. I'm not toing and froing just to suit in with your plans, my dear. I'll do what I can now, and the rest you can sort out with the owners... Look! You really should go. The doctor said we should stay in quarantine. We've been very ill, it could be contagious. - We have chickenpox. - Don't worry, dear. I've had it. You sure have. How'd you get this? It wasn't me, I hope? No. I slipped in the shower. Caught it on the tap thing. Really? You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were such an innocent little thing. - How wrong I was. - Not complaining, are you? No, no, it's just, looks can be deceiving, huh? Hey. Don't go yet. - Why not? - Stay for a while. I wanna hold you. I don't want you to go yet. Why? What do you mean, "why"? - Well, we've finished, haven't we? - Well, yeah, but... Then I should go back. - What's up? What is this? - You want me again? Well, yeah, but I'm not talkin' about sex, Elise. Shit, I never thought it'd be me saying this. - I wanna get to know you better. - I haven't got time. Besides, I've gotta go now, or Peter will go mad. Hey, fuck Peter, okay? What about us? I can imagine just how mad your Peter can get. Maybe I ought to go and see your brother. No, Danny! Listen, if he ever hurts you, I'll kill him. You hear me, Elise? Then you shall wear my colours. I'll take this to the fight tonight. You haven't forgotten, have you? - Town hall, the championships? - Seven-thirty. Where the hell have you been? I was worried. I knew you'd forget. You asked me to buy some more vodka. Took your time. Well, it's Sunday, isn't it? The shops are shut. I had to go to a pub and buy it. I had to wait until they opened. I think I'm very clever. Maybe. What's all that muck on your face? Trying to hook a local lad? No! I don't like it. Go upstairs, get rid of it. Peter! Argh! Peter! - I brought you these. - Thanks. Elise, we heard you screaming. Did he hurt you? That was nothing. Just Peter playing one of his games. - God... - I mean, it's not right, Elise. Surely you know that? It's not natural. It is to me. He just really loves me. He can't show it with fine words, so he shows it with deeds instead. He just plays around, and punishes me when he thinks I deserve it. He punishes you with sex, Elise. It's not right. Given the choice of that and a good beating, I know which I'd rather have. - Elise... - He just loves me too much sometimes. - Where is he now? - Asleep. He's been drinking. Never could handle his drink. Elise, listen to me. When you were out, he murdered someone. Who? The woman who came to clean the house. He shot her through the head and dumped her off a cliff. I saw him do it. I know he'll stop killing! When we get away somewhere safe, he'll be different. He gets all... He... He gets all... What? Strung out? He's a homicidal maniac, Elise. You know, sometimes he cries and I have to tell him it's all right. Maybe you're right. There is something wrong. But locking him up's not gonna help! - He killed our parents because of me. - No. - Wanting to be with me! - No! He could see in them what he could become... Elise, no! That's different. It's murder! He killed them so he wouldn't end up like they were. Yeah, yeah, I can see the logic in that. He never wanted to be really bad like his parents, who get pissed off when they find out he's sleeping with his sister... - Bryon, ssh! - So he shoots 'em. Great idea! I had such a wonderful time with Danny. Now you say these things to me, and I don't know what to do! I want to go into town to see him tonight, but I can't. I... Look, look, you get the car keys, we'll drive you into town, okay? - We can take you to Danny now. - We can do it. I can never go! I can't! - Please. - No, you know I can't. - No! Elise, come back! - I can't! Go away, Danny. I've thought about us. It won't work! Get away from me. Peter and me, we have to be together, just like Byron's story. We're linked together, like an old tragedy with the wind, and the sea, and our destinies. They're all linked, interwoven. There's no place for you. Shouldn't be down here, Ellie. Not dressed like this. You'll freeze to death. I don't know what I'm doing here. But it feels like I belong here now. We'll find somewhere like this where we can be together. Stop looking over our shoulders. Somewhere full of tragedy and mystery. Where souls linger forever, caught between the sand and the surf. Don't go gettin' all melodramatic on me, Ellie. Not like one of your novels. I need you here with me. This is real life. Take a good look. Hmm, the face sort of looks familiar. Don't know. Maybe he just reminds me of somebody. What do you want him for? I'm surprised you haven't read about him. - I can't read, mate. - But you can see. It's not advisable to withhold information from the police, especially connected with a mass murderer like him. Murderer? No. Don't ring no bells with me. Sorry, I can't help you, mate. We haven't heard back from Forensics yet, but we're pretty sure we've got the vehicle they used. Yeah, I... I know it's slow progress, sir, but he's been so elusive. Yeah, I've just come off the phone from our men in the area. I may be grasping at straws, but they seem to think one of the fishermen they spoke to today recognised Reece's photo. Yeah. Yeah. It could mean he's already left the country by boat. No, no other definite lead. No, sir. Right. Oh, shit. What are you doing? No-one'll mind if I take these books, will they? - What for? - My shop, of course. I thought I'd get packed and ready for the morning. Yeah, we'll leave early. I'd better check on our hosts. You should go to bed. It's late. In a moment. I'll watch the storm for a while. Is he dead? No. Sleeping. Think I'll stay here for a while. Seems a shame to be leaving a horny little thing like you behind. Peter? Peter! Elise, you didn't come! You didn't see me win. I'm a champion, see? You've got to get out of here! Aw, I'm all cold and wet. You wouldn't throw me out into the storm, now, would ya? Okay, we'll dry you off, then you've got to go. Take your clothes off and I'll find something for you to wear. Ellie, how about we both take our clothes off? We can't. Where is that brother of yours? I ought to knock him out, too. - Ssh! He's upstairs. - Yeah? Well, he won't know what's cookin' in the kitchen, then, will he? Still with us? Thought you were dead. Smile! You're on Candid Camera! Elise? Wash all that filth away! Between your legs, come on! - Please, you won't kill him, will you? - All of it! Please don't kill him, Peter! Get him out. Get him out of every little crevice! He didn't mean to do it! It wasn't his fault. I asked him to come here! I did! Hey, hey. Ellie, don't lie to me. I've met scum like him before. Please... When I think of what we do to scum like him inside, he'll wish he'd never been born! You're hurting me! Please, Peter, don't kill him! Just... Just lock him up somewhere till we've gone. Please, Peter! You go to bed early. Leave him to me. Janet Farrell. You have? You sure? I've just this second checked it out, and everything seems to fit. It was some disabled guy who phoned. His wife does a cleaning job for the people who let this house called Nowhere. Great name, eh? Anyway, we'd checked the house before, and there was a honeymoon couple renting it. An American couple. Wonderful. This'll be a great boost for tourism. I can't see why you're so sure you've got the right place. I checked with the tour company, and the honeymooners were supposed to fly home yesterday, but they didn't turn up for their flight. And we've managed to get that fisherman to talk. Reece approached him on Friday, wanting a boat to take him out of the country. And the interesting thing is the wily old sod said he was with a foreign woman. American, he thought. Good work, Helen. I'll be with you in five minutes. I wanna be fully briefed. This is a very delicate situation. I'm on me way. Good mornin'. Sorry about that, I don't know what came over me. You do know why you're in these palatial surroundings, don't you? Strung up like a dog! You crazy bastard. Let me go! Let you go? Let a rapist go? I'll let you go down there. When I've finished. When I've had my fill! Peter... Please... Let me in! It wasn't his fault! Please don't hurt him anymore! Please... She wanted me to. I didn't force her! "Oh, she was asking for it, milord." Is that what you're telling me? Please! You really can't go round stickin' your big stick into other people's little sisters without their big brothers gettin' a bit pissed off! Please don't hurt him any more! It wasn't his fault! Go back to the house, Ellie! I invited him here! I wanted him inside me! I still want him! She's right! She wanted me! No. She's lyin'. You! You! You brainwashed her with your small-town talk and smarmy ways. I'll make sure you never rape another girl again. An eye for an eye. That's fair, isn't it? Well, isn't it? Please! He didn't do anything! He wouldn't hurt me! ♪ Raining, it's pouring ♪ Old man is snoring ♪ He went to bed ♪ Bumped his head ♪ Couldn't get up in the morning ♪ Couldn't get up in the morning ♪ I really don't think you're gonna be in a position to piss... ...let alone screw someone else's property.
