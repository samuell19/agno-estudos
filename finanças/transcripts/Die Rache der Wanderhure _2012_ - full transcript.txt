THE LEGACY OF THE TRAVELING WHORE Nuremberg in the year of 1430 Stop. Your husband is unbeatable today, Marie. It's good for the treasury. Not for me. With respect, my son would like to see his father whole. Is Michel someone for a cradle? The Saxon, death and the devil. I wager 50 guilders on Hohenstein. Who's in? Marie? My husband's life is worth more than your treasury could ever pay me. Forgive me for not taking part in this game. Your husband is really unbeatable. Is it true you want to leave the court tomorrow? Yes, we want to bear our son on our castle. A son. How can you be so sure? I am sure. And you are right. A woman can sense these things. I think the king can also look forward to having a son, too. Marie, you seem to be the only one here who doesn't begrudge me... my happiness and doesn't bear a grudge about my past. Let us drink. To a son. To a son. Will you excuse me? So, are you well? Yes, I am. And your son, your heir to the throne, is also very well. The heir to the throne. To take me as your wife... will make your subjects more than happy. His Holiness in Rome will... also be pleased. It will ease his decision of whom to crown emperor. Don't rack your pretty brain about politics. That's my job. We stand together, we fall together. For God, Saint George, and Saint Michael. I, Michel von Hohenstein, pledge to defend the cross of Christ... to defeat and obliterate the enemies of true faith with God's help. I also pledge purity of intention, decency, respectability... and loyalty to my king until death. Marie, don't go. The court is not my world. Your husband is a knight of the king. - New honours bring new duties. - You're a court lady. To be what? An embellishment of the king's dinner table? It's all full of pride and untruth. Everyone is seeking their own gain. There is nothing false about my oath. You are too good for this court. Our son, the first knight in our lineage, Marie. All our descendants will be knights. Even if something happens to me, with a son you will still be a baroness. No-one will ever lay claim to your home again, even if I am killed. But what good is a knighthood to your son if he has to grow up without his father? Come to Hohenstein with me. Come home. Marie, I'm committed to the king. - I am... - The king's best knight. I know. You haven't shown your face in a long time. My faithful wife. Is he still well-disposed to you, our glorious king? He is more so every day. I have new medicine from the court. Give it to me. It's about time I leave this god-damn tower... and finally take what's mine. Who would have thought? Falko von Hettenheim, the eternal henchman... who was believed dead, enters into a pact with the only power who can pose a threat to the German-Roman empire. A truly clever move, my husband. The white son of the Khan will come. He wants the king's head as much as we do. And no-one will stop him. If you knew the Tartars the way I know them, Hulda... War is their life. They drink the blood of their horses... like that of their enemies. They move across the eastern steppes like smoke. They are scattered. Whoever unites them creates a storm which cannot be stopped. Not even the armies of the devil. - That's no weapon for a knight. - You should move with the times. This here is worthy of a knight. But you could aim perfectly. Watch this. Your Majesty. Horsemen from east. Nurgal Khan. Delegate and son of the Great Khan Terpent Khan... - ruler of the Golden Horde. - Greetings. What brings you this far? Negotiating about land. We claim the land east and west of the Duna... which is our due, the Pannonian Plain and the Carpathian belt. Just so I get this right... You are claiming Hungary from me? You don't seem to know who you are talking to. According to God-given world order, I, King Sigismund... I'll tell you, about my order of the world. The Great Khan, my father... comes first, then I, then my horse, then the dirt... underneath my horse's hooves, then for a long time there is nothing. And then you. - You dare... - What, king? Don't you respect your own laws? Is there no truce here in Nuremberg? Here, and a quarter day's ride around here. After that, you're outlawed. - And I advise you to ride fast. - You can't catch me. No-one catches the wind. Before you celebrate the death of your God... your land will belong to me. And then... I will nail you to the cross. May the plague get these slit eyed heathens. As soon as the Hussites are quiet, the Tartans arrive. Why is that god-damned bastard a Tartar, anyway? He is white. The question is, why did he come to announce his intentions? - As if he bore a personal grudge. - I have never seen him before. Wolfram, Bernhard, you get him. Keep the truce. Kill him outside of it. - And bring me his head. - Do the Tartars intend to attack? It's about time they gathered to elect a Great Khan. And when they feel strong enough and bloodthirsty, nothing will stop them. We will have to make sure. And we'll bring a present to the Great Khan. His son's head on a rod. Hohenstein, lead the guard. What? - That is too much honour. - Rubbish. I'll get the rest of human material... - Not from the Hungarians. - We have no other choice. Those yellow hellhounds won't put a single hoof across my border. Marie, why are you so angry? Why should I be angry? There is no war, my husband is not going into battle. So remain within the safety of the castle until our son is born. With all these false women and... See, our son doesn't want you to go, either. Don't tell me what our son wants. You don't carry him under your heart. Can't your king do without you for a few days? You'll catch up before the army arrives east. You have my word. I'll see you before our son takes his first step. I trust you with my wife. - Look out for her. - With my life. Do we part like this? We needn't part. Go on. HOHENSTEIN CASTLE Berta, come here. Will you stop? Berta, come here. Hiltrud, Mother and Father, they are here. They'll be here soon. When the time comes he'll know who he belongs to. Why did you leave your homeland? A healer goes with the wind. My journey just didn't end. The wind kept driving me to the western lands. Maybe it'll blow you back to your people one day. We've got her. Be careful, you oafs. She still has to give birth to her child. Bring her to my castle. Go. Oh God. Not now. Not here. I'm the wife of the imperial knight Michel von Hohenstein. Let me go. Do you hear me? What do you want from me? I'll give you everything I have. My jewellery, I... Help me, please help me. Hiltrud, they should be here by now. - Yes. - What if my brother was born... on the way? In a stable? Like our Saviour? I'll take two guards and go to meet them. - I'll come with you. - No. But I want to come. No, Trudi. You stay here. If I can't come along, I'll hold my breath until I burst. You are your mother's daughter, child. Yes, I get to come along. Oh God. What have I done? Why am I captured? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Holy Mother full of grace, rescue me and my child. Please. Come on, or we'll both die. Come now. Oh God. I am... - I am the king. - And a man. No men are allowed in the birth room. Or do you want your son to have the evil eye? No. No. Water. Go on, faster. Take this. Off you go. Is it... is it... A son. Your son, Your Majesty. Doesn't even weigh as much as sceptre and imperial orb. No, much more. The first male heir. Well said, Hulda. Well said. My first son. I managed something your husband, my cousin didn't... when he was alive. A child of royal blood. Fathered in a night which had no equal. In such nights, rulers are fathered and no servants. I hereby renew my vow to marry you. But first I need to ride east. We leave tomorrow morning. I will come with you. - But... - A son belongs with his father. And a wife with her husband. - You stay here. - What is over there? Holy Mary, help. Greetings, Nurgal Khan. HETTENHEIM CASTLE Last time we met on the banks of the Danube you looked better. I will accompany you. I have made arrangements. You can't ride. You are too week. Let me be your representative. I am going east anyway, with the king. What is the use? She's our man at the court. She will give you notice when the time has come... to lure the king into a trap. Our man at the court is a woman? What does she know of the art of war? How close to the king is she? Believe me, no man could be closer. I made sure of that. Let us set the seal on our pact. I want the eastern realms and the head of the king. And I want to see my family crest on the royal seat in Nuremburg. Very well, all has been said. We shall meet again as kings. Sigismund has sent out his bloodhounds. They are looking for our ally all over the country. Except for here. Clever, Hulda. When are you off? The king leaves tomorrow. With me. What would I give if I could force Sigismund into battle myself. And see his face when he learns who he owes his downfall to. You... That was the last time you used me. No-one will force me into another man's bed again. - This way. - Yes, lady. Faster. Good. Check on the woman in the dungeon. If she's not dead yet, wring her neck. Open up. Open the door. What about your husband? When will he follow us? He won't. He will wait here and ascend the throne when you have killed the king. You better follow him. He thinks you're fleeing him. How large is the army? Two patrols, lansquenets... a few horsemen, 50 royal guardsmen, 8 knights of the Order of the Dragon. He wants to claim more troops from the Hungarians. Which he won't. If you deceive me, I will make sure your body ends up on a stake. Mercy. Where is my child? What did you do with my child? I don't have your child. Where is he? Where am I? Release me, please. I swear on my life I won't tell anyone. I need to see my son. You will come with me. You better forget what's behind you. You belong to me now. Your life starts afresh. You can have many more children. By me. You see, I don't treat my property that badly. Never, no matter what happened to me, have I been someone else's property. Gather your strength. We'll ride all night to overtake the king's army. I wonder if I'm a father yet. There, take a good look, my knight. Who knows how many battles you will win with him. Strong like his father. A splendid looking chap. What do you say, men? Every inch a king. Why don't I see a head yet? It's like trying to catch smoke. We haven't found him yet, milord. We check all roads leading east... comb the forest, secured all fords. - Nothing. - May I? It's time for the wet nurse. Isn't this too dangerous for wife and child? A wife belongs with her husband. With his son. To the sun king. What is it, Hohenstein? This is how we mark our borders. Beyond the swamps is the realm... of the Golden Hordes. Soon on this side, too. Not afraid of the dead? I have learned to fear the living more. The souls of our dead enemies watch over us. Whom we have defeated in life is indebted to us in death. We believe that the souls of all those whom we did wrong... will haunt us and demand justice. Right is what I do... what I say. I am Khan. You will be the most beautiful flower of my harem. If you give me what I desire. There is nothing I could give you. Only what you can take. Don't entertain hopes of getting through here on your own. There is no way. Unless one is a bird. - Nurgal, you were gone a long time. - How many tribes are gathered? The Great Khan is expecting you. And the clans of the steppe led by Baladur. Baladur is leading them? Your new slave. Make her work until she knows her place. You will beg to be allowed to lie underneath me. No. Eat. My man at the camp of the king will drive the king into battle. He thinks our people are weak and lesser in numbers. We will oppose him here, with a small army. After a short battle we'll pretend to flee. This is the plain where we will wait to catch the king's army. They never learn from their mistakes. It is pride which makes them fall. Once the king has fallen, the western princes won't have a leader. We will overrun them, one after the other. Your tactic is good, Nurgal. But... who decided you would be our leader? The council will decide once it has been convened. Sure. What are you doing here? She was eavesdropping. Did you want to see me? I'd rather go to hell. Good thing you're back. What is it? When you mean me, when you are with me, we can continue. Mind the eyes of the Nainai. She sees everything. She is the headmost woman, and you are the lowest. You are nothing. Anyone may kill you. Get changed. If you do as I tell you, you may survive. One of the warriors might take you into his jurt in one or two years. You have nice hair. Don't set your hopes on the Khan. So beautiful, so proud. And the only woman who doesn't want you. Come on. At least, you fly home. Marat, you're alive. Yes. And your child is alive. - What do you say? - And I know who has him. Don't dare touch her. She belongs to the Khan. - Hulda. She wasn't pregnant. - Get lost. A son? How can you be so sure? I think the king can also look forward to having a son, too. To a son. Michel. No. Eat. Quickly. Go on, eat. - Who is this woman? - She belongs to me. And you let her work in rags? I give you two others for her. She'll be added to my harem. Be patient, I'll find a way. Son, there are women who are as valuable as a goat. And some women are as valuable as a good horse. Yes, I know. And then there are some whose value we don't even know yet. It can't be true. You're not the Eagle Woman. You know nothing of us. Tell me if she is the Eagle Woman. Tell me if she can see. What does this mean? What is she doing? Nainai knows all the secrets of the Tartars, the past and the future. She sees who you are. What does she say? She says, open your spirit. Ride your spirit horse into this life or into the eternity of heaven. No. I can't do this. And? You really saw? Everything I wanted to forget. - Why you? - I didn't choose this. I didn't want to go there. You have to see the Khan now. For the prophecy to come true, the Eagle Woman needs to see the Khan. BORDER FORTRESS HUNGARY Where are the Tartars now? Somewhere beyond the eastern border of your kingdom in the swamps. This is hell. There is no getting through. And we don't know how many they are. We won't take any risks. - We need more troops. - Your Majesty. The Hungarians have arrived. Right on cue. Heavy ordnance? Horsemen? How many? Five, to be precise. - What do you mean, five? - The top five princes are waiting. Enthusiasm is different. - What do they want? - Get married. What, all five? And they see me? If I interpret this document correctly, this is about you. - Hungarians trust blood ties more... - Than my word. Go on. These ladies are available. - This is Prince Bela's daughter. - That's the fat one. - But she is tolerable. - How much? Two regiments of Hussars. Far too little. Then this one. Barbara, I think. Several thousand lansquenets, brigadiers, horsemen. Are those pockmarks? No, transport damage, Your Majesty. Good. Let the wedding bells ring. Alika, why are you doing this? I'm no longer the Khan's first lady. That's you now. You're the Eagle Woman. - What does this mean? - That you are holy. I am not holy. No normal person is holy. - You are not a normal person. - Yes, I am. I'm a woman like you and any other. As you wish. You are... Don't say it. Never again, to no-one. - Baladur incites the khans against me. - Only you have what he doesn't have. Knowledge of the enemy and connections to their camp. Nurgal, my son. You are chosen to take my place as Great Khan. And to unite the tribes of the Golden Horde again. You will lead them against the western barbarians. I will finally kill the man who took my family. This is your family. Since the day I found you in the steppe. Nurgal. Son of the sun. I am, Father. So I will let our enemies burn. - You're not afraid of my eagle? - The eagle is in my family crest. I am Marie Eagle Baroness of Hohenstein. Woman of the clan of the eagle, welcome to the jurts of my people. I thank you. You are a great and just ruler. A man who doesn't rule in his jurt won't be ruling in the steppe. I'll make you the first lady of my harem. You need not fear anything. Anyone who touches you will lose his hand. First or last is immaterial to me. Your name will be respected in my people. And when I die, no man will own you against your will. - I can't be your wife because... - It's not your turn to talk. Look at me. Stay, mama, no. You are the most unrestrained and passionate woman I can imagine. But you will still leave tomorrow. You're sending me away? This is an army camp. - If anything happens to my son... - You don't have a son yet. Before God my son will always be my son. Even if I marry the Hungarian, it doesn't change... - anything between us. - What Hungarian? She will bring me the Hungarian horsemen, lansquenets, weapons. I promised you two things. I will be able to keep one of them. You legitimise our son? Even more. I grant him vindicae regnum. The right to rule? If my marriage remains unexpectedly childless. But that's politics. It doesn't concern us. You will remain my favourite. Forgive me, but I can't take responsibility for that. You need to save your strength for your lawful wife. - Everything quiet? - Everything peaceful. Shut up, you silly cow. Don't drop the child. Come on. Attack! Take the corpses off the road. And take me to your Khan. Do you slit eyed mutts understand? Go on, hurry. For the hundredth time, no. I don't want to be disturbed. So, when we move out, the Hungarians will secure the right flank. Heavy ordnance and lansquenets in the centre. On the left... - the river covers our infantry. - We've never gone to war like this. That's why you always lost against the Tartars. God damn it, I'll have you all tarred and feathered. I'm sorry, Michel. I'm so terribly sorry. - If only I had left earlier, I... - I'm to blame. It's all my fault. I should never have let Marie leave on her own. You had no choice. Yes, I did. Alika, I don't want to take him from you, nor your position in the harem. - It gets better with time. Gentler. - I need to leave. Impossible. Mungal's guards won't leave you out of sight. You can't leave, you're the Eagle Woman. - The prophecy must be fulfilled. - What prophecy? In times of need, the God of the Heavens sends the Eagle Woman to protect his children from harm. You can't leave now, war is looming. Alika, as the Eagle Woman I command you to let me go. Your children should grow up like mine. And you have to let me go so I can help you. Wait. Take the horses to the camp. Quickly. You stay here. You go with Marie. The horse stays here. Go. Back to the camp. - Thank you. - Marie. - You won't regret letting me go. - You are the Eagle Woman. You know what to do. We're near the swamps. Then we almost made it. Quiet. My child. That's my child. I have to go back to the camp. - If she sees you... - She'll try to kill me... - but she won't succeed. - OK, let's go back. No, you give Michel the message. I swore to protect you and I failed once already. You did not. I'm not without protection. The Khan's son is my shield. Tell Michel his son is alive. Go. OK. Take the route over the hill. That way you reach the camp before Hulda. Nurgal Khan, we need to talk. Your man in the enemy camp is a woman? She is a useful as any man. The khans will beg to differ. Trust a woman or hope the wind never turns again. - Who was that? - The Great Khan, my father. What brings you here, contrary to our agreement? We need to change our plan. Sigismund will gain Hungarian reinforcements. - How? - He's getting married. You need to wage war on him now. Impossible. Not all clans are here. Take the men you have into battle. They will do. - Your husband is better? - He would be if he learned... of your victory over the king. He is waiting impatiently. I hope the wait is not too long. Marie? She is alive? You took her. Why did you do that? We had a contract. - I have a contract with your husband. - You gave your word to me also... following his unfortunate demise. I'm Nurgal Khan's first lady. And I demand my child back. Your child? Ridiculous. You weren't pregnant. Whose child is it? - Alright, he's not my child. - Why did you take him? Not under the eyes of your... whore. Nurgal, she is lying. I know what she's planning. I know why she needs my child. Give me my child. You stay here. So, what do you need the child for? Now that my escort has been slain... the king must assume I was robbed. Which is good. - I can go back and report... - Report what? Report that I was kidnapped, but managed to flee. But his son is still in your power. What else would lure him into the swamps without a big army... if not the worry about his only son? The plan is good. Isn't it? And I ask nothing in return except a tiny service in return. Hey, get lost. Earn your money elsewhere. He has other worries. Don't you think it's enough yet? You have an army to command. I'm not commanding anything here. Tomorrow I'll take my child and go home. You swore to protect the kingdom. You are the King's knight. I have Marie on my conscience. I have my son on my conscience. I should have never let them go on her own. I should have stayed with them. I'll talk to the king tomorrow, he'll set me free. Slain, you say? On the way? I can understand your decision. And I am sorry for your loss. I was connected to Marie, too. More than you think. I release you. After this campaign I release you from your word. Father, Hiltrud, I get to ride the prettiest horse of the castle. You take her. Take her to the convent of the Holy Women in Nuremberg. Take what you need from Hohenstein and sell the rest. I want her to have the best education. Michel, you are her father. No. I'm no knight and no husband. Believe me, it's better that way. Take Trudi home. And what will you do? I'll go to war and let myself be killed. You want the crown. Step aside. And you can only rule through my son. I warn you. You know me. I only appreciate what's useful to me. What's of no use to me, I'll feed to the dogs. - If you thwart my plan... - Leave him be. - Marie, just one word... - Please. And now step aside. In my country, stories are told about the eagle. In my country they say, an eagle once saved the king from the snake. Women's gossip. He who doesn't believe anything has no home, Nurgal. - You won't dare. - How can you be so sure? We're alone. You'd be dead before you hurt me. You're right. I'll make it easy for you. Do it. She ordered you to kill me. No-one gives me orders. - What do you know about Hulda? - She is driven by hatred. She knows neither friend nor foe. She will ruin anyone who is in with her. What does she want? Ask her. And ask yourself. I want retaliation. I want justice. And I will get them. I always get what I want. What you deem to be right... and retaliation is the pain over what has been done to you. Who told you the king murdered your parents? Was it von Hettenheim? The Crimean tribes. Come on, we have to go. What is this, Hohenstein, are you tired of life? If you want to let off steam, do it with me. Step aside. This is an order. - Only once you are yourself again. - I won't tell you again. Tartars. - How many? - One. - They'll send more. - It's a trap. They don't negotiate. No, it's Marat. Marie is alive... and so is your son. And when you're of sound mind again, I'll tell you where. I knew I could rely on you. My friend. I'm so glad Marie and the child are alive. I had lost all hope. I don't know any man who survived this. What wants to live, lives. I thought I'd never see you again. And I thought you were safe on Hohenstein. Hiltrud, how is he? Can he ride? - No. - Yes. I'll bring back your mother and your brother. - Until then, you listen to Hiltrud. - Yes. I know you believe in different Gods. Come back safe. So you want to desert with your slit eyed friend? - Wolfram, my wife is alive. - Says who? Him? I will get my wife and my child. Kill me if you want to stop me. If you desert, you'll be a dead man upon return. And your wife a widow. - So we'll come with you. - You what? We'll accompany him. If he goes alone, it's high treason. Together, we're on a mission. We can bear witness upon our return. And watch good friends closely. Four swords are better than two. You are under my command. I tell you, we will ride further than ever before, rule the western lands. We will complete what Timochin didn't achieve... and find the place where the sun sets. We will, under my command. I will lead the attack. I know the enemy. And only I have connections to his camp. Yes, women. Who are you to command us? Whose blood flows in your veins? Actions make a man, not standing nor provenance. Is there one amongst you who can say that my son ever acted dishonestly? You didn't convince the khans? And you had such a good argument. The king's head. But since you prefer to be sentimental... Marie is a constant danger. If she flees, all our efforts are in vain. She is of no use to you. I, however, I guarantee you even more. - More than the king's head? - Domination, Nurgal. My husband didn't tell you the whole truth. - How do you mean? - You can beat the king's army... - but never rule in times of peace. - Why not? Your blood is wrong. That seems to be my destiny. The western princes will only... accept royal blood on their throne. Otherwise, the war will never end. I, however, am from a royal house. They will accept me. Rule with me. Let us found a dynasty. A dynasty of rulers. What does she want here? She wants war. Alika, the Nainai... Can anyone see her? I heard Nurgal scream at night. Could she help him see the past, too? Yes. Why? If I don't get through to Nurgal... my son will be lost to me. Then, everything will be lost. King Sigismund is not the murderer of his parents. I know it. His army never went into Boyar land. Boyar? He speaks their language. And he calls out for a woman. He has never said my name. Let us make a pact. The Gods will cast him who breaks it... into eternal damnation. My word, I'll lead the king to you. You will rule without bloodshed. Your word, kill Marie. For me. For us. You have to go. The strange woman is calling for your head. I can't go. - My child is here. - Run. He will kill you. The khans will only follow him if you're dead. You can't kill me. You gave me my life. - You owe me life. - You're not a Tartar. - And you're not the Khan's real son. - All the better. He who does not feel bound by anything does not belong anywhere. Be quiet! When you open your mouth I feel like I don't know myself. So kill me. And you will never know her true intentions. Even though you took me for exactly that reason. You mistrusted her from the start. You know I can be useful to you. - Prove it. - In my country, no woman can rule. Unless they are the mother of a son of royal blood. Or via the crown, and she doesn't need a man by her side for that. She will kill you, after you slay all her enemies. She will have a document on her with the royal seal. A testament to the royal blood of the child. My child. If... If you tell her but one word... - my son will be dead. - Or I kill your child. That will solve all my problems. What kind of man are you? Doesn't anything have value for you? No honour, no conscience, no humanity? You want to be a king? You act like a tramp. What have I done, Alika? I killed my child. You deceived me. What is this? A letter for safe conduct through the principalities of Hungary back home. I'll translate it for you. It's the king's recognition of your son. - You want to betray me. - It's word against word again. What if Sigismund is dead? Then I won't need the child. Maybe we've founded a new dynasty already. A dynasty of kings. - What is your intention? - He stays here as a pawn. You will bring me the king. Ride now. I will expect you in seven days with the king on Skull Mountain. I will do my part for our plan. You better do yours. Kill her. How does he find his way? Everything looks the same. They don't need to see, they can smell it. Is this a celestial phenomenon? We have arrived. Dismount. - He said, dismount. - What? - Dismount. - Take your armour off. Like hell I will. What for? Too noisy. You sound like a bell. Good God, what is this? The army that eats the earth. It's the downfall of the Occident. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Your God won't help you here. And the Tartan Gods won't hear you. It's your God, too. - It was your mother's God. - A weak God who lets himself be killed. What use is he? Can he defeat your enemies? Can he protect you from pain? Look at you. No, he can't protect us from pain. But he helps us through it. What do you plan to do with my child? Did you tell her? Come, we're celebrating in honour of our Gods tonight. You, too. I have something for you. You've grown so much. You didn't harm him? Thank you. I wouldn't destroy my best pawn. With the child, I have you both. Go back to your Khan. We've come this far and are just gathering moss now. You leave it to the slit eyed heathen to get your wife? He might set his people on us. I would die for Marat. You'll sooner get the chance for that than you wish. I believe that he's your friend in the west, far away from home. But this here is Tartar country. You don't know the Tartars. When the last Great Khan died 20 years ago, death swept the country. More than 100,000 Mongolian warriors paid their respects to their prince. Nothing that crossed their path was allowed to survive. No man, no woman, no child. Even dogs and cats, wild animals and birds... had to follow the Great Khan to the other side. Believe me, as soon as the flimsy bond of your friendship tears... something uncontrollable will emerge. We should attack. We should stay. - Marat says it's safe. - Yes. Deadly safe. This is no forest, this is a graveyard. We are going. You're not in command here. No, but I have more experience. This smells of a trap. Never. I and my brother will ride into the camp and bring back your wife... - and your traitorous friend, too. - You are deserting. No. You are deserting. I am attacking the enemy. Thank you for the time with my son. It's so peaceful here. I was so afraid of your world. And now... Why do you want to destroy all this? What for? Everything will remain as it is here. But another man will sit on your king's throne. No. It will end as it started. The jurts will burn. The fathers will be killed. And mothers will die in front of their children. This image will haunt them forever. I don't understand you. I don't understand you, either. Not at all. - Are you a man of honour? - Yes. So you would not be wrong according to the law of your people? No. What if the king wasn't the murderer of your parents? - Would you still kill him? - He did murder parents. You don't know that. You really think you know me better than I know myself. - That's not the point. - Tell me who I am, then. Am I capable of being Khan and lead my people? Or am I a just an alley dog whom the Khan rescued from starvation? Tell me, Marie. I can't. - But the Nainai can. - You went to see the Nainai? Not on my own accord, but... Nurgal, wait. You goddamn slit eyes. Let me go. Nurgal, tell them to stop. You know these men? They're here because of you. How did they get through the swamps? How do they know the way? I don't know. You're lying to me. You will never lie to me again. I'll get the truth out of you. One of you will die today. Marie, you choose. What does he want to do? You don't want to know. It's to do with horses. - Marie, tell them to take me. - No. - If anyone is sacrificed, it's me. - Definitely not you, Hohenstein. In front of your wife... I'm the eldest. I am in command, remember? Even if I'm wrong. Tomorrow at sunrise I have the king's head. We're leaving at nightfall. I'll speak with the khans today. But first I'll find the traitor. Are you a man? So fight with me. Who showed them the way? I don't know. Stop it, Nurgal. Stop. Look at him and tell me who. I don't know. I don't know these men. The king must have sent them. How else would they know I'm here? Stop it, I beg you, stop. Alright. If these men mean nothing to you... Nurgal, you have to talk to them. Right now. We'll continue later. Get the child. No, not my child. No... You have to rescue our son. We will die anyway. It was all so fast. They came over us like devils as soon as we left the castle. They were all slain. They dragged me and our son into the swamp. I managed to escape at night. Please forgive me. Your son... Is dead? The white son of the Khan has him. The damned bastard. I myself will tear him into pieces. And this time no truce will stop me. Summon the knights and guards. - We'll comb the swamp. - You don't have to. I memorised the way. There is a small throughway that's passable. The entrance is marked by a pile of skulls. - How many are there? - Must be some 50 men, no more. We're leaving tonight. I'll get my son. Myself. Now. Let's go. - Marat, I won't go without my son. - You don't have to. Rescue your child. Ride as fast and as far as you can. - We don't all have to die. - I'll do anything to stop the war. Marie, come on already. Michel, no. Please. You let her go. I didn't want her blood on my hands. Not hers. They are as good as dead. We will attack tomorrow. We'll overrun them. We will crush them like the grass under the hooves of our horses. These traitors are from your horde. Your fault. That's why I demand the right to make up for this. I will throw my life forward in battle. As the first, as your leader. They will be trembling at the sight of our wrath. Their cities will crumble under the hooves of our horses. Their dead bodies will fertilise the grass which feeds our cattle. Their wives and daughters will bear our seed. We will make our mark on their sky. Let it rain blood and wash them off the face of the earth. I think we lost them. They didn't come after us. We would be dead by now if they had. Why did he let us go? Your son. You almost died and it was my fault. I shouldn't have left. I will never let go of you again. But first we have to get through this goddamn swamp. Let me go first. It's not far now. They won't expect us. They think themselves safe... in the swamp. But be quiet. Not a word. And stick to my steps. There is something. No. I'm Michel von Hohenstein. You're fighting your brother in arms. That was close. What are you doing here? I'd like to know, too. Hohenstein, is that my son you have there? You're a daredevil. - It's my son. - What? It's my son. And I'm here to take him and my wife home. He's in league with the Tartars. He and his traitorous Tartan friend. If anyone is not to be trusted, it's this woman. She kidnapped me and stole my child. She's in league with the Tartars. She wanted to deliver you to the Tartars, here in the swamp. That's enough. Weapons down, all of you. Give me my son. Never. God is my witness. This is my child. I gave birth to him in the Hettenheim's dungeon. No-one can ever take him from me again. She's lost her mind over the loss of her child. And over the treason of her traitorous husband. Dare to speak about my wife like this? After all you did to her. - And nobody calls me a traitor. - I do. Where are the men who rode with you? The King's knights? Did you slay them yourself or did you leave them to your Tartar friend? That's enough. Marie, the child. All have spoken. And it looks like... it's word against word, man against man and woman against woman. Let's have the women decide whose child it is. Are you ready to accept God's judgement? So, in front of God and all saints... You take the legs, you the arms. Who pulls hardest gets to keep the child. What? Go on. What is it? No more courage? Stop it. You're killing him. Forgive me. A wise decision, my king. A truly brilliant move. Here, - take your son. - But... My child. You should have read the Holy Scriptures more often, Hulda. Old Testament, Book of Kings... - Salomon, verse 16-28. - No, that's ridiculous. - I don't accept it. - As you're so keen on justice... you will be brought to justice. I sentence you to death for high treason. The sentence will be executed after our return in public. Until then you can do some soul-searching... and consider the meaning of the words loyalty... love... and decency. - Seize her. - No. Don't touch me. You won't judge me. Not you. No-one will judge me. No-one. Without me, you're nothing. King for one more day. And you, Marie... you'll have your son, your golden boy, just for one more day, too. The gates of hell are open. The world sinks into chaos. 200,000 Tartar warriors will attack tomorrow. Nothing will remain... of your proud kingdom. You will go down in history like you wanted. But as a fool who... Let the dead be. Our life awaits us in the border fortress. Trudi and Hiltrud are there. I can't come along. What will I do if you won't come back? There is still a spark of hope. And I will make use of it, for us. Do you know what the Tartars believe? Nothing is ever completely true. Life is the beat of a wing in the face of eternity. All my life I strove to unite the kingdom and become an emperor. Now I will die as a king, after all. Never mind. We all step naked in front of our creator, anyway. And I learned one thing. Your loss weighs more. I would give my crown for being able to mourn a son... - a wife like yours. - Marie is still alive. I know it. Your Majesty, two more days. Trust Marie. Did she ever disappoint you? No. But this is bigger than anything... One day and one night. Nurgal, - I didn't betray you. - What do you want? I can show you the murderer of your parents. - Tell me. My time is short. - You know it yourself. You just need to remember. Come. Andrei. Andrei. That's your name. You just screamed it. Wait. Andrei. You said you were a man of honour... and would not take revenge on the wrong man. Nurgal, - what happened? - Not Nurgal. Andrei is the name my father gave me. And I gave you the name Nurgal. - I am your father just as much. - No. You're my father's murderer. Who says that? Did she say that? I saw it. I went to the Nainai. What do you want from me? You made your judgement. I want to look into your eyes while you lie. You lied to me... all this time. You raised me in the belief all evil comes from the west. You took my family from me. My soul. And for what? Why? I gave you a life. Here. I won't go to war against the king. This is not about the king. You swore to lead our people west. To the land where the sun sets. Our people... This is not my people. I don't belong here. I don't belong anywhere. Whom should I fight for? Against whom? What do you want to do? Andrei, don't go. I'm not going. Do you remember what I told you about the souls of the dead? Whoever defeats us in life, we're indebted to them for eternity. I'm not going. I'm sorry. Great Khan, I speak to you as one who was full of fear when she came here. I didn't know your people. Everything was foreign. But now I know that courage and honour live in those jurts. I cherished your son. He was my hope. What is good about wanting to die just to once see the land... where the sun sets if there is a life where the sun rises? How many more fathers need to mourn their sons? How many wives their husbands? Your son wanted to end this war. Now it is up to you to grant him his last wish. One day and one night. We won't wait any longer like rabbits in a hole. We will show our face to the world. With pride. We stand together, we fall together. Your Majesty, the Great Khan's peace envoy. In the name of the endless blue sky, I greet you, King Sigismund. I come as the envoy of the Great Khan of the Golden Horde. Terpent Khan wishes to make you an offer. He will make peace... if you pay your respects to his son. We decided to trust the enemy. To our peoples continuing to respect each other and to live in peace. You are forever part of the hearts which beat for one another. May your children grow up in the knowledge who they belong to. The Tartars will return... to the jurts of their fathers. Thank you. - Don't you want to come with us? - I was never happy in houses of stone. My life is here. I thank you. But I never was the Eagle Woman. You became her. - Don't you want to reconsider? - No, Your Majesty, with all respect. My sword will not serve any master. But whenever you need my advice... - I will give it to you. - And where will I find you? Where are you going? Do you mean to become a farmer or... - be a shepherd with the heathens? - We will find our place in the world. As long as we're together. Home is not a place. What about it, Marat? Are you coming?
