[MUSIC - CARAMEL, "FEELS LIKE A SUNDAY"] (SINGING) Say hello to this ghost town in my mind, if I spin it around in circles or just stand still in time. I got this feeling, it's like getting out of school. Something's in the air and it makes me feel uncool. I could change the world by owning a bed. No one's home and all the streets are dead. It feels like a Sunday. It feels like a Sunday morning raid. I don't want your Monday, it feels like a Sunday. RADIO DJ: (ON RADIO) 108.1 Rock Radio. And that was Caramel, and you're listening to Rock Radio's resident wise man, the baddest cat since Freddie in Elm St. I'm Louis Liberty. Now I know, you're as excited as I am with the tickets and backstage passes to the Caramel concert this Saturday. So bring your ragged best down to the voice of the people booth, down here at 108.1 and tell us why Caramel is the greatest band ever and you, you could win! Time. [interposing voices] Too easy. Game point. [music playing] You guys are really good. You got that right. Yeah, man. Oh, what do we say we make it a little more interesting and I don't know, double the bet? That's another 20 bucks man. We scored last five baskets. All right. Give it up man, give it up. [inaudible] Hurry up. You're going to be getting this back soon. - Nice talking to you. - See? You just lost it. It's too easy. What are you doing? We go for it. Knight in shining armor? I love it. - You got it. - Yeah. All right, all right, all right. - All right, let's get it going. - OK, let's go. [chatter] I had Wheaties for breakfast. OK, come on, guys. We just starting out. Come on. - Let's go. Come on. [chatter] You going to rock? What are you, a drug dealer? Oh, do you like me? Oh! Oh my god, Helen, you all right? Oh! [music playing] This is your fault. It's your fault, man. You [inaudible]. Somebody should tell them that gambling is a sin. I love a knight in shining armor. You love the attention. Well, you're a great victim, Helen. So you guys are coming down to 108.1 after school with me for that Caramel contest, right? What Caramel contest? Meet Lou Liberty? All we got to do is go down to the Talk Back, record a little something about Caramel, and the best one gets tickets, backstage passes and everything. But today's the last day so-- Oh, this is just great. This is-- Hiya, guys. Wayne Taylor. And I have not had my shots yet. You're a funny guy, Rob. I always liked that about you. Yeah. But I hear bad things. Scamming the other kids isn't nice. Unless you do it. So I'm afraid I'm going to have to fine you. Now, what was it you took off those geeks? Plus a penalty. Right. Let's say 90 bucks. Is that it? I knew you'd understand. You see, because this is my school, and if I let you and your little friends here get away with this, how would it look? Wait a minute, you ain't got no right-- Larry, Larry, relax. Wayne, here, calls all the shots. In fact, he's letting us off easy. Aren't you, Wayne? It's a weakness. One of the many reasons I am loved by everyone. Right. $90? 90 bucks. I think I have. I got 20, 50-- stranded tourist-- What? What? Oh, nothing. I said I'm like a stranded tourist. You know, I'm giving you all my money, I have no traveler's checks. I'm like a stranded tourist. Come on, come on. Nine, ten. There you go, sir. $90. Thank you very much, monkey boy. [crash] Just get your hands off me. Amy? I've got $90. I have $90. (SINGING) Your puppy is your friend for life. He's even better than your wife. So when you pop on something crunchy, make sure you give him something munchy. Babe over on the left. That one over there. I really want her vocal to come forward. You know what I mean? The one over on the left. Yeah. Hang on. Hang on a second, kids. Hang on. Spencer, see the deal is that this is a chorus piece, right? So that if we have one-- No, man, I'm paying for this gig, man. This is the girl that comes forward. We want her. Yeah. No problem. OK. Make it happen. OK, we're going to try this again, and could you come right up front, right on to mike? Right there. Yeah, great. OK. Let's try it again. All right, let's do it. Roll tapes, Zal. [music playing] That works. That works for you, does it? That's great. (SINGING) Your puppy is your friend for life. He's even better than your wife. So when you pop on something crunchy-- [door closes] How are they doing, Simon? Oh, great. Wonderful. Yeah, Louie, please. I'll wait. Tell him it's Rhonda. You too? Yeah, they just said I was excused. Yeah, someone called from the office, said Larry McGuire is excused from class for the rest of the day. Yeah, same. Yeah. Sweet deal. I know. Hey, guys. I figure everybody that's going to be going to this Talk Back booth thing today is still going to be in classes. Talk Back? Try to keep up with us here, Helen. Larry wants to go see Caramel, we're stuck in school, and we've got to get out. So how'd you do it, man? Faxed a couple of letters to the office. I'm telling you the truth, they really should not believe everything they read. Anyways, we get to the Talk Back booth, nobody's there yet. And then Larry McGuire's finest moment, he describes how much he loves Caramel. We get the free tickets, and we end up going to the concert. Feels like "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." Ferris Bueller? Good. [music playing] What's shaking? Oh, Los Angeles. Yeah, Rhonda called me after you left the studio. She said you're pretty bummed. She's got that right. I'm going to have to close down the studio. I don't have any more money. We did our last session today. It was a dog food commercial for Puppy Munchies. (SINGING) Even better than your wife. Maybe the first one. Listen, I got some work to do. I need some moral support, and you ain't doing much. Come on, I'll get this. OK, buddy. Where's your damn roadies when you need them? Ah, yeah. Check those leads. Let's go. All right. But without the bands, you can't get the coverage. Nobody wants to know you. Yeah. You can't get the bands without the publicity, you can't get the publicity without the bands. So there it is, Louie. I've got to get people talking about Tone, again. I tell you, I need something. Something good. Everything good's already been done. Listen, I got this Caramel contest. I gotta screen these tapes. There was a time when I'd tell you a joke, my friend. Yeah, Caramel. Not much of a name, but I thought Hootie and the Blowfish was a good name. What do I know? But Caramel-- they're good kids, they do good music. Yeah, there was the time when doing good music was enough. Hey, like, my name is Olivia. 555-0192. I mean, Caramel is so cool, you know? I mean, like, when you see them, it's just-- You have to watch this? It's my job. I've been a fan for a very long time, OK? Since they were, like, young. Virginia is so-- When you're 15, the world is old. I mean, I totally want to be like her. Totally. She's so pretty, and she's sexy. That's what we need. Something that has image, sex appeal. Something that her and her friends can all identify with. What can I do to reach them? I mean, what do I even know about them? What's to know? You make music, they listen to it. I used to make music. --cool, you know? Now, I make dog food commercials, I mean-- Larry McGuire, 555-0305. OK, the thing about Caramel, right, is they got this wicked stage show. I mean, we're a live act. That's what is such a big hit. No, it's their lyrics. You have to have the lyrics. Louis, what's a guy got to do to get a decent cup of coffee around here? You got to pay me large sums of money. Not for this, I'm not. No way. Come on, I'll get you one. HELEN SAGE: (ON TAPE) lyrics, all lyrics. ROB TENNANT: (ON TAPE) It's popular for three reasons. First, they keep their material accessible. So there's something with which everyone can identify. Second, they they keep it simple. They got good rhythms and good lyrics. And third, they got great publicists. Publicity, that's what it's all about. It's all just business. I think somebody realized that the kids of today are the ears of tomorrow. As I was saying before, the stage show, it's really good. [music playing] There you go. Keep it. [inaudible] Whoa, jeez. Zal. Yeah. I thought I was going to get mugged. No offense. Right. So what's going on? Did you talk to him? Just said come down. C's working late shift in emergency, otherwise, I wouldn't be here. Who? C. My old lady. Oh, yeah, right. No, tomorrow. Get it down here before eight. Yeah, as soon as you can. Hey, look, Louis. I mean, you're the hottest DJ there is a New York. Find a way. OK, bye. Sit down. What do we need? Sleep? No, sleep's for amateurs. What do we need? Zal? Digital equipment. Close, but no cigar. Rhonda? Money. That will come, but that's not it, either. What do we need? We need publicity. Think about it. We can't sign any big name bands, because nobody's heard about us. And nobody's heard about us, because we don't have any big name bands. That means nobody's talking about us. It's a vicious circle. What we have to do is to get people talking about us. Rolling Stone, Spin, Melody Maker, Teen Machine, Tiger Beat, 108.1, and MTV. And all of them. . Once the bands have heard about us, we can sign them. And everything comes from publicity. I don't want to rain on any particular parade, here, but where are we supposed to get this publicity? I was hoping you'd ask that. Who runs the music business? Barry Gordy. Hm. Technicians. Lawyers and accountants? You're all right, but who do they think runs the music business? Kids. Talk to them, anybody out there, they'll all tell you that kids run the music business. And at Tone Records, they're right. OK, think about it. A few days from now, the little office-- the one with the cleaning supplies-- except now, now, on the door, it reads Vice President of Talent. Oh, I'm loving that. I'm loving that. Vice President of Talent. The press is here, all of them. They're all waiting. There's an old drum roll, and in through the door walks the new Vice President of Tone Records. A 15-year-old kid. They're going to cover the story just to say what an idiot idea it is. All those kid magazines-- if we get a face, they'll run a quarter cover at least, I'm telling you. MTV, they're going to eat it up. Once we get the publicity, once they're yakking about us, we can sign the bands. Somebody big. Somebody huge, I'm telling you. Somebody huge. We'll make them an offer they can't refuse. We're back on top. Don't worry about the kid. We can ease him out, no problem. I mean, who's going to notice? Because we're back. OK, OK. Yeah, I see that. But for interviews, this kid can't come across, like, you know, like a nerd or a banger or anything. Or Motorhead. No. No, he's got to like music. He should be a nice person. Oh. Cool, not a geek. RHONDA: Not long hair. ZAL: No skinhead. HARLEY: Oh, no, no, no. No trash. ZAL: No grunge. Not hip hop. He's got to dig every kind of music there is. Could it be a girl? So where are we supposed to find this kid? Fuck! Fuck! [inaudible] I'll get here. Louie Liberty called me this morning. The radio station called. Did you hear me, man? Liberty. U Liberty. Caramel. Rob, Caramel. We are going to see Caramel, man. Caramel? Caramel? What? Yo, man, just get up. Come on, come on. Get up, get up. Oh, no, it's morning. Nothing gets past you, does it? Oh, what time is it? It's, uh, it's ten after eight. Come on. I called Helen. She's going to meet us on the way. Why? Because they want to see all three of us that were on the tape. What? Is that all you do is ask questions? Come on, we got to get down to 108.1 right now, before school. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, man. All right. [music playing] I bet you're going to want these. We're going to be late for school. What? School? You kidding me? I never heard of it. All right, detention, getting grounded, ever heard of them? Yo, you it's simple. We pick up the tickets, we tube it to school, we explain when we get there. Besides, anything goes wrong, Rob can fix it. Right, Rob? [music playing] Cool. I think they're terrific, too. Yeah. They got such a neat sound. [music playing] (SINGING) Me and you and road that leads nowhere. Take me around the block, baby, one more time. Tell me again what's yours is mine. Don't make me walk, we've come too far. I just broke up, I just broke up with my car. [inaudible] So I bump into Spencer in Los Angeles. He's doing the LA thing. He's got the fresh squeezed orange juice, the croissants. That guy wouldn't know a bagel if his mouth fell on it. Hey, here's our contest winners. See what I mean? A bagel. That's a New York thing. Bagel, bagel, bagel. Give me this thing, here. I'll tell you who I've got here. I've got Larry McGuire. This would be Helen Sage. And I got Rob "Bagel Boy" Tennant. Folks, check it out. This is Caramel. Simon Briarly, Andy Curran, Virginia Story, and Eddie Zeeman. Collectively, Caramel. Very nice to meet you. I really like your music. It's really good. VIRGINIA STORY: Oh, thanks a lot. ROB TENNANT: You guys really seem to have it together when it comes to your music arrangements and lyrics. Not to mention marketing. Yeah. I think it really makes a difference, though. I hope you enjoy the show. I'm sure I will. All right, listen. All right, if you guys are ready, we got things to do. Fellas, you hang out for a little bit. Folks, come on, guys. We need pictures done for publicity. We need your parents to sign some forms. We need that ASAP. You'll get your tickets as soon as I get the forms back. And yadda-yadda-ya. Get these forms filled out by 4 o'clock, you'll have your tickets, your passes, everything will be taken care of. No, if you get them back by 3:30, we can make the 6:00 news. All right, do what she says. And also, get us some autographed pictures of me. I know these kids will want-- kids, you'll love autographed pictures of me, won't you? Yes. You see the way he schmoozed that band? The kid's a natural. You think he can do that full time? He doesn't have to. We trot him in for the media. Two, three weeks, tops. Then it's old news. And then, by that time, Tone's back on top. That's right, buddy. You've done it. Feels like it, doesn't it? Hang on. Hang on, hang on. Hang on. Yeah, it's Louis Liberty, Rock Radio, 108.1. Yo, Rob. Still can't believe it. Yo, this concert's going to be so sweet, man. I mean, it's going to be even better than those behind the dugout seats Helen's dad got us two years ago. Oh, no offense, Helen, I was just saying-- None taken. Great. All right, well, I'll call you guys later. All right, see ya. - All right. [music playing] Hi. Hi. Can I help you with anything? That old guy was at the radio station today. Who is he? I don't know. Just wanted to catch you. Whoever he is, he used to have a lot of money. Look at that suit. This, from a guy that thinks sneakers are dressy. What's wrong with my sneakers? Honey, don't drip that. Be very careful, because I don't want to have to wash those, too. Helen. That guy, the car-- you ever hear of Tone Records? No. Me neither. But that guy owns it. He's an old guitar player. He played with Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. He offered me a job. Yeah, right. Check out my title. Rob, this is unbelievable. Vice President? That's what he said. Vice President. I'm going over there after school. I'd really like it if you guys would come. Great. So who else knows? Nobody. I tell everybody at the press conference. Press conference? Yeah, press conference. We're doing it on Monday at 10 o'clock. Tell him about the contract. Ready for this? 500 guaranteed a week. $500? Yo, yo, you could buy-- you could buy-- I could buy a car. A condo. No, you can buy season tickets to the Knicks, Rangers, and the Giants. Plus new [inaudible] for each of the games. It's shoes. Man, it's shoes. Man, we are so paid. Yo, yo, did I ever tell you how much I love you, man? No, you haven't. Hey, how are you doing? Rhonda, right? RHONDA: Yes. Good to see you, again. Hi, welcome, Rob. These are my friends, Helen and Larry. SIMON ECKSTAL: Hey! Rob! Mr. Eckstal. Good to see you. Simon, call me Simon. All right. SIMON ECKSTAL: Hi, kids. You looking forward to the concert, tonight? This is Helen and my friend, Larry. Hi, Helen. Hi, Larry. Rob, we got a lot of stuff to do, so maybe your friends would like to just wait here. And Rhonda, can you get something for them? Um, no, thanks. It's OK. We just walked over with Rob. We've got to go. Yeah. Whew, look at the time. Can't stay. Would you like a Pepsi or something? No, it's all right. Gotta run. You guys can stay here if you-- See ya. I'll talk to you later. OK. Well, we've, got a lot to do, so-- got to meet everyone, first. And you know Rhonda, right? Yep. So put this down. OK. Put this down here. Thank you. Right here, that's good? Yeah. Your office is through there, but I want to show you the studio. All right, cool. Come this way first. [MUSIC PLAYING - CROSBY, STILLS, NASH, AND YOUNG, "OUR HOUSE"] (SINGING) Staring at the fire for hours and hours while I listen to you play-- This is the control booth. Cool. And the studio's in there behind the window, but I don't expect you spending much time back here. This is sort of the nuts and bolts ends of things. Right. We need you to be doing like press releases and interviews. The publicity. Yeah, exactly. You know, Tone Records is in touch with the kids today. That sort of thing. What's-- what's all this? Zal, this is Rob Tennant. This is Zal Adams, my engineer. Very nice to meet you. You're the new guy? Yeah. I'm about as new as they get. What do you think of Caramel? I like them. They're good. And of CSN? Crosby, Stills, Nash? I never did think Neil Young added much to the sound. I like him a lot better as a solo. HARLEY: Simon? Simon? Yeah? Get this. I just had a meeting with George Saxby. Hi. Rob Tennant, nice to meet you. Oh, right. The kid. Yeah, how are you doing? Good. Yeah. Anyway, Saxby says Dave Matthews is thinking of cutting a new single, and he may be looking for a new label. There's a chance we can get to talk to him. Nice to meet you two. Yeah, that's great, kid, but we're a little busy here, right now, OK? OK. Rob, this is Harley Yates. Charmed to meet you, too. Kid's got some ego, huh? Play nice, Harley. Look, call George, see if he can get us in to talk to Dave. And make it for Monday, you know, after the press conference. Speaking of which, we've got a lot of work to do. [MUSIC PLAYING - CROSBY, STILLS, NASH AND YOUNG, "OUR HOUSE"] (SINGING) La, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la-- OK, let's go over this again. You are a legitimate vice president with a legal contract. OK, let's try the speech again. Good morning. My name is Rob Tennant, and I'm delighted to take this opportunity to announce the Tone Records has hired a new vice president in charge of talent, me. Yeah, longer pause before me. More impact that way. Now, they're going to ask you what experience you have in the music business, and you're going to say-- None. Then why did he get the job? Tone Records wasn't looking for business grads. Tone Records wanted somebody who is in touch with teenagers today and with their music. Good. Why you? Experience. I've been a teenager for years. Wait. Wait a minute. I didn't write that. Nothing that you wrote has anything to do with me. I sound like some kind of corporate mind-control puppet. That is good copy, bucko. You read it like I wrote it. All right, all right. Up to you, bucko. But everybody at that press conference is going to smell what this really is and what field it should be spread on. Simon-- OK. What would you say in your own words? Oh, Simon, come on. That finally, somebody's decided to listen, instead of always talking. Let's try it without the copy. Simon! Relax. We can always come back to it. OK, now what about the company history? Copy, or my own? Just wing it, off the top of your head, go for it. Yeah. All right. There you go. These are gold records. They're awarded when an album sells 500,000 copies. And beside them are the pictures of the musicians who made the records. I mean, some of the greatest names in music are on this wall. Aretha Franklin, Jimi Hendrix, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton. Simon Eckstal is in all of these pictures. He played guitar on these albums, and that's where he got the money to start Tone Records. And from the beginning, the only thing that ever mattered to Tone was the music and the people behind it. [music playing] Hello? LARRY MCGUIRE: Rob call you yet? No, what's up? He-- he's not coming. What? Yeah, he called me from the studio, and he said he got too much to do getting ready for that press conference on Monday. Oh, man. It's not going to be the same without him. He said he was sorry and that he was going to make it up to us. How? LARRY MCGUIRE: I don't know. This isn't like him. Maybe this is the way it's going to be with him working, now, and all, you know? I'm going to see Caramel, you coming? What? You joking, right? Cool. I'll be ready in half an hour. LARRY MCGUIRE: All right, I'll see you. [MUSIC PLAYING - PAT BENATAR, "STRAWBERRY WINE"] (SINGING) Life is sweet. Sweet as strawberry wine. And bitter-- Duncan Gelman, "Spin Magazine." This is wonderful. It is. But how old are you? I'm 15. What makes you think you can make a significant contribution to the record company? What makes you think I can't? Look, there's a lot of people out there that know more about the business of music than I do, but none of them are on the streets every day. They're in their offices, asking each other questions about what me and my friends are thinking. I'm Tone's pipeline to the street. Rebecca Rankin, Much Music. You're pretty slick. How much coaching did Simon and these people do in getting you ready for today's press conference? A lot. They wrote down probable questions, points to stress, demographics-- but I figure, if you're smart enough to come up with the questions, I should be smart enough to come up with the answers. These read like business school cheat sheets. My first day, and I'm getting ticker tape. REPORTERS: Rob! Rob! Over here! In other show biz news, people have been saying for years that the music industry is being run by kids. Well, tonight, we have proof that that's true. Our own Kathy English has more. Simon Eckstal, president and owner of Tone Records, one of the hottest labels of the early 70s, announced that they have signed 15-year-old Rob Tennant as their new Vice President in charge of talent. SIMON ECKSTAL: Well, Tone Records is going in a whole new direction. Amy, are you hearing this? SIMON ECKSTAL: We want to listen to the teenagers, not just talk to them. And who better to do that than a teenage vice president? Can we have a moment of silence for the late Rob Tennant? I'm very, very sorry. I apologize. My phone has not stopped ringing. Oh. There it is. A cell phone? Yeah. Must be nice. Can I order Chinese, man? Hold on. Hey. Yes, Rob Tennant. How are you? Yes, I will call him. Give me the number. Oh, hold on on sec. Hold on. OK, give it to me. Terrific, thank you. Goodbye. Need anything else. No, I think that's it. I just got to make this phone call first, and we're good. Hi, this is Rob Tennant. Mr. Campbell asked me to call. Thank you, all right. Guys, I'm really sorry. My phone has not stopped ringing since like 7 o'clock this morning. It's been incredible. Hold on. Hi, Mr. Campbell. It's Rob Tennant calling. Sure, I can do that after school. Tone Records. Terrific. All right, I will see you then. Goodbye. All done? I don't know, guys. I feel like everybody wants to talk to me, you know? You got to get used to it, man. I mean, you're news, now, you know? The rest of us have to get to school. Guys, it's just some thing, you know? You got that right. Yeah, man. It's some thing. Look, I will-- [phone rings] [inaudible] Hold on. Hold on a second. LARRY MCGUIRE: Sorry. Got no time, man. Hi. Yes, Rob Tennant. Thank you very much. OK. [music playing] Hey, Rob. How's it going? Hey, how you doing? Hey, man. What's up? Well, hey! Wow. Wow. Hey, guys. You're famous. And late. You should have your own business cards and stuff. Uh, actually. You're joking, right? No, I'm not joking. I actually have them right there. Rob Tennant. Take a look. Oh, man. Pretty nice, huh? Come by, give me a call. Do lunch, do the whole thing. LARRY MCGUIRE: Got his own cards. Yeah. He got his own cars. He's going too far. Is this funny? Guys? Dude, you got a minute, man? Do I know you? No. Hey, I'm Douglas. Hi, nice to meet. Rob Tennant. - How are you? Listen, listen. Well, my cousin has this band, right? Yeah. And, you know, I figured, you know, since you're in the industry, maybe you could-- maybe you could listen to it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, and whatever you think is cool. No, cool. Just like that. Thanks, yeah. It's all good. You know what though, actually, let me give this back to you. I've got a better idea. I'm going to give you my business card, and you can send it to the studio, and I'll listen to it there. All right? - Right on. - All right. - Thanks a lot. - I'll talk to you later. All right, ciao. See ya. Ha ha. Rob's closing the deal. Hey, I saw you on TV. Imagine my happiness. You should have told me. Why? Was I talking to you? Anyways, Rob, you and I should have a talk. A private talk. About who your friends-- - All right. --about who your friends should be. You are going to be meeting some very big people. Stars. You need friends that are going to be comfortable with this kind of attention. This kind of social standing. I should be careful with who I'm seeing. Exactly. I got it. But you know what, Wayne? Don't worry about it. I am sure there are people here who like you. All right. - All right. - I'll see you later - I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye. HELEN SAGE: Let's go get something to eat. Yeah. You can buy, Mr. Vice President. Oh, guys, I really apologize. I'm made an appointment for lunch today. Hey, business is business, right? Wait, hold on a second. Tone gave me an advance, so I'll pay for lunch. No. Thanks. Whatever, man. What she said. Where's that going? So Rob, what do you think about girl's fashion? Like, what do you like? I like-- Like, what do you like to see girls wearing? Like, what look makes it for you? Well, I'm really-- I'm big on the sneakers. Yeah. Big on the jeans. Yeah. Big on the t-shirts. Colors! What colors? Do you like bright colors? Or maybe you like them a little more subdued? I like them-- Or pastels? Like, how do you feel about pastels? Or patterns? Like, bright, yes? Bold, yes? I like, uh-- Simon. Simon, can I'll talk to you later? Yeah, of course you can. Thank you. Of course you can. Sorry. Must be so nice to be in the heart of all of this. Yeah, yeah. All this excitement, all this ah! Ah! Right. Yeah, it's fun. So, anyway, so, Rob-- Uh-huh. --if you were a tree-- Yeah. --what type of tree would you be? [music playing] Hi. Hi. How are you doing? It's Helen, right? Yeah. Rhonda? Yes. Larry? Yeah. How you doing? All right. Around the corner and first on the left. Cool. OK. Cool. Yo, Rob. What's up, guy? Hey! Hey, guys. How you doing? How was the limo? Something I can get used to. Yeah? It's just an extended cab. It ain't no thing. I thought you guys might want to take a tour around. What, you mean like our window on the world of music, huh? A guided tour from Mr. Music himself? [music playing] Here's where it all happens. This is the mixing board. This is where we mix all the music. That's a 24 track. That's the studio. That's where the recording artists work. - Yo, what does this do? - No, don't. Don't-- don't-- don't touch that. Zal doesn't like us to touch that. This is so awesome. This is unbelievable, man. Shit, man. Oh, there you are. Here, call this number for me, OK? Name's on the paper. Richard Morton. Set up an appointment. Wait a minute. Huh? What part don't you understand? Why do you want me to call them? Something better to do? Hmm? Um, that was Harley Yates. You had all your shots? You'll be all right, you know? You just got to-- you just got to come out of your shell a little bit. Just-- Yeah, I, um-- I got to rock. Yeah. Yeah, we'll just, um-- [music playing] OK. Is this all today's mail? Yep. Oh, for the kid. Yeah, cassettes. It's working. Hmm. Hey, those aren't addressed to you. Oh, Rhonda, come on. A couple of days, kid's going to be gone. What's he going to do with these? Hold a sock hop at the local gym? Man sits on my last nerve. (MOCKINGLY) What's the kid going to do, hold a sock hop at the local gym? So how was that big party last night? Wasn't anything much. We introduced a new band. How are they? Not bad. Must be a real burden for you, having to go to all these parties. You know what, guys? They're all the same thing. It's the same people, talking about the same stuff, eating the same food, drinking the same drinks. Drinking? You was drinking? Perrier. So are you busy tonight? No. You want to come over and study? I mean, do you still have to pass math, or what? As far as I know. So-- So what time? Around seven. Rob, are you coming? Seven? Yeah. Yeah, cool. [MUSIC PLAYING - CROSBY, STILLS, NASH, AND YOUNG, "TEACH YOUR CHILDREN"] (SINGING) You, who are on the road, must have a code that you can live by. And so, become yourself, because the past is just a good time. Talk back. How do you know it was me? No aftershave. What does the talk back do? Talk back allows you to talk back to the studio. Cool. What does that do? Equalization. Oh, so sort of like tone control. So like it was bass and treble. Yeah. Huh. Yeah. Cool. I got that. Like a bicycle is sort of like a Ferrari. Um, Zal? Is this all I'm supposed to do here? What? I mean, all I've done is come in here after school and sit in my office and do interviews. I mean, I go out to clubs, and I talk to Rebecca Rankin, and I go in limos and I, you know, but-- It's rough. Yeah. It's dirty work. But, uh-- but it's got nothing to do with music. Sit down. The reds are your mike lines, which is leave them online. This is your EQ, equalization. Those are your band widths, your pan and effects ins, and your effects returns. Don't worry about them. You don't need them. [MUSIC PLAYING - CROSBY, STILLS, NASH, AND YOUNG, "TEACH YOUR CHILDREN"] (SINGING) You-- I'm going get me on chocolate. Oh, there's your master slider. Put it wherever it makes you feel good. (SINGING) -- become yourself. OK, Rob. (SINGING) Because the past-- Your board's hot. (SINGING) --is just a good-bye. Teach your children well. Their father's health did slowly go by. Don't you ever ask them why. If they told you, you would cry. So just look at them and sigh. And know they love you. [phone rings] Yeah? Yeah. Have they signed with a label yet? OK. I'll be the club at 8:30. OK, bye-bye. I'm really sorry. Hey, Rob. Hey, Robbie. Oh, hey, man. What did you think? Of? Of-- of the tape that I sent you to the studio of my cousin's band? No, dude, I never got it. Are you serious? I got-- well, I got lots here. So-- uh, OK. Here you are. All right, thank you very much, Rob. Really appreciate it. And listen, is it true about you having lunch with Bush? No. Do you really know Snoop Doggy Dogg? No. But you are doing Trent Reznor's next CD? - No. - No? No, I'm not. I really don't know you guys are talking about. Yeah. I'll see you all later, all right? All right. Hey, can I get one of those? Uh, yeah. Good, huh? It's double-sided. Hey, guys. It's been really crazy. Yeah, go figure. Yeah, whatever, dog. I'm sorry. It's been so busy lately. Hey, no problem. Excuse me? Hi, Amy. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Fine. Good. I was g-- I'm having a little party a week from Saturday, and I don't have a date yet. Oh, I'm sure you'll find one. I thought maybe you'd like to be my date. [locker slams] Yeah. Wonderful. Yeah. And by the way, if there was anyone you'd like to bring-- My friends would-- would-- gone. That's cute. I meant anyone famous. You know, like rock stars or something? Right. Right. Silly boy. LARRY MCGUIRE: Helen, check this out. Hey, wait up. What are you guys doing? Nothing. Going home, Rob. Home, OK? But maybe that's just a lowly peasant after-school thing that you just wouldn't understand. Come on, guys. Relax. How's Amy? Oh, so you're just gonna-- you're going to give me a really hard time? What kind of friends are you guys being? Us? Take a look, Rob. Who's been ignoring who? Ignoring? Guys, I invite you down to the studio all the time. Whatever, guy. I remember, like, once. That's not true, Larry. I invite you down there all the time. It's not worth fighting over. [horn honks] Your limos waiting. I have responsibilities and things I have to do. Hey, we you understand. Have a nice life, Rob. [horn honks] [MUSIC PLAYING - TREBLE CHARGER, "FRIEND OF MINE"] (SINGING) --make claim on your design. I will not call you a friend of mine. I cannot follow your disguise. I will not-- LARRY MCGUIRE: George, come on. I mean, who was there for you when Epiphone wanted that contract? Yeah, and who got you into BMG? A mil and a half for the artist advance. Get back to me, OK? OK, George. Bye. Do you ever have one of those days when just nothing worked out for you? Yeah, I think they-- I think they call it Rob's world. Ugh. Here. Drown your sorrows. Designer waters, [inaudible]. So, what's on your mind, then? Music. Tone Records. Me. I'm trying to find anything they have in common. You know, I do interviews, I make phone calls, but what does that have to do with being vice president of talent? So you're not happy then? No, that's not it. I just I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do here. Well, what would you like to be doing? Music. Rob, what do you know about music? I know more than when you hired me. Well, that's true. So? Look, two weeks ago, Tone Records was history. That was George Martin on the phone. He used to produce the Beatles records. I've known him for maybe 30 years. Two weeks ago, I couldn't even get him on the phone. And yesterday, I had lunch with Eric Clapton's manager. Lord knows I have been trying to get hold of him for months and months. Now he's calling me. Because of me? Right. You did what I wasn't able to do. Put us back in the picture. So now that we-- So now we've got a shot. We're working hard to sign a name band. Like I said, you've done your part. Just, please, let me do the rest. I mean, I made phone calls, I did interviews. What-- Everyone has to do what they do best, Rob. Look, I'm not saying that this is all I'll ever be for you. There will come a time when you'll know. But for now-- Bring on the interviews. Whatever it is, I didn't do it. I believe you. I saw you not doing it. What? Not telling the truth. You're setting that boy up. You're making him think that he has a future here. That's wrong, Simon. That's not being fair. Did I say something it wasn't true? No. Did I promise him something I couldn't deliver? That's not the point. That's exactly the point. I gave him a chance to shine, and he did great. I never said he would stay. You know the business. Yes, I know the business. But he doesn't. I've known you a long, long time, and I never once didn't like you. Until now. [MUSIC PLAYING - TREBLE CHARGER, "RED"] (SINGING) Saw you looking for a light. Face painted cigarette white. You asked the cleanest boy you found. You couldn't see me turned around. His fingers stretched across your empty gaze that I just can't escape. As the red fades from your wrinkled dress, a picture of the people you've impressed hangs on a wall around here. Visions starts to when I'm near. And the evening-- I can't believe you haven't seen it. You know I had a deprived childhood. Yeah, but it's classic. Rob says-- Rob? Yo, Rob says a lot of things. Yeah. I read the book. The movie's a lot better. Jodie Foster is great, and wait till you see Hannibal Lecter. It's awesome. You'll see. [movie music intro] So? Yeah? You see Rob today? So how about them Knicks? Come on, Larry. 16 straight points in third. He's our friend. Way I see it, they keep it up, they're going all the way. [phone ringing] McGuire. Hey, Larry. Rob. You must be bored or something. Thanks a lot. What's up, man? Just called to say hi. Done that. And that. So how's work? Lousy. That's too bad, man. How is, uh-- how's Helen? Why don't you ask her that? I'm asking you. What do you think, man? So what have you guys been doing? Nothing. Like what? LARRY MCGUIRE: Nothing. We just chilling, watching movies and stuff. Which ones? LARRY MCGUIRE: Look, Rob, this is getting tired real quick, all right? No offense, or nothing, but if you want to know what we're doing, come do it with us, man. Jeez. I ain't the 10 o'clock news. I just-- I just called to talk, you know? I'm all talked out, OK? Yeah. Well, all right. I'll talk to you later. You hung up on him? LARRY MCGUIRE: He didn't want to talk. He just wanted news, weather, and sports. And I got better things to do with my time. It was Rob. Mm-mm. That wasn't Rob. That was Rob's evil twin, the record exec. You know, I bet he even called me on his cell phone, too. Yo, I've known him since he was, what, six years old? You've known him, too. But you don't see it? He's changed now. Go figure. He's hanging with-- what, I don't know-- rock stars and stuff. Anybody he wants. He don't need us no more. [MUSIC PLAYING - TREBLE CHARGER, "FRIEND OF MINE"] (SINGING) Where-- where are you going now? Doesn't matter. Backwards through another year. I'll come down, too. I cannot find a way. I'll make no claim on your design. I will not call you a friend of mine. I cannot follow your disguise. I will not. I will not. After school, I was talking to Larry, and he was thinking about maybe-- Can you help me out with English after school? He was thinking that maybe-- And math, too. Because I'm not doing too well in math. I could really use your help. Listen, it's Friday night. I've got nothing to do, so I say we go over and sneak into Lee's palace. Come on. All right, if you don't want to go, that's cool. Just tell me how to get in. You'd get nailed without me, Helen. You know that. [music playing] All right. I got nothing better to do. Let's go. I love it. Enthusiasm. Hey, taxi! [music playing] Sorry. They got security on the doors. Mm-hmm. They're not going to fall for my brother's band, or bathroom break. Right. So what? I always say, you make your own luck, Helen. I think tonight, we'll call it a sign of the times. All right. Give me some. - Here's half for you. - Half? I'll take the other half. Look for me in the back, all right? OK. All right. [music playing] [crowd chattering] [crowd squealing] That was pretty exciting. Let's head in. All right, let's go. Rob, you're amazing. Oh! That was pretty cool. [MUSIC PLAYING - TREBLE CHARGER, "FRIEND OF MINE"] (SINGING) --mine I will not follow your design. I will not. I will not. I will not. That band! Who are they? I don't know, but they sound familiar. [crowd squealing] (SINGING) I make no claim on your design. His band. His cousins band. His? Whose? I don't know. Some kid from the school give me a tape. Douglas, Doug. His name is Doug. I've heard this song before. Harley. Harley, the guy from Tone Records. He-- I heard him say it. He took it from me. Come on, let's get closer. What? I can't hear you. Let's get closer. TREBLE CHARGER: Thank you! [crowd screaming] [MUSIC PLAYING - TREBLE CHARGER, "EVER SHE FLOWS"] (SINGING) You'll have to wait. I haven't bothered. To offer up debate-- This is really good. [inaudible] This is the kind of music we should be doing. Yeah? Simon said there'd be a time, and this is the time. I mean, this is really the kind of music that we should be doing. (SINGING) We see them in. I'm not alone. Ever she flows, like a veil undeciphered. It's me who knows, by the way. Let's do this twice. Unlike today, start again. It's what you chose in the end. Let's get this straight. I'd like to stay and pretend. It's what you chose in the end. It's what you chose in the end. Ever she flows, like a veil undeciphered. It's me who knows, by the way. Come on, let's go. Let's go. [crowd cheering] So great. That was good. You guys were awesome. Great show, guys. Hey! Treble Charger. You guys have a label yet? What? Do you have a contract with anybody? Who are you? I'm Rob Tennant. I'm going to give you my card. Whoa. You guys can [inaudible]. Here's one for you. Vice president of talent. Give me a call if you guys want to make a record. Give me a call. All right. Um, yeah, all right. Get out of here. What did you do that for? You're such a jerk. We could have stayed there all night. Yeah, I know. The band was really good. I know. I don't understand you. I know. You are the oddest person. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. You're not really a jerk. I'm not really mad at you. [MUSIC PLAYING - FLEETWOOD MAC, "SONGBIRD"] (SINGING) For you, there'll be no crying. For you, the sun will be shining. 'Cause I feel that when I'm with you, it's all right. Are you this kid? Are you the kid in this? Yeah. Yeah. Well, come on back in, and tell us what you were going to tell us. I thought you guys were going to throw me out again. No, man. No, we can get you back in. You want to make a record? Definitely. Yeah. (SINGING) -- know the score. Helen! Helen! (SINGING) I love you like never before. Yeah, a record. All right, studio is right around the corner here. And we'll get someone to prop open the door. Not in this neighborhood. Right? OK, well then, I'll just stand by the door. You guys can just set up in there. Perfect. I lose more sleep because of you. Trust me. They're good. You got to spring for some flowers for C. She don't like me out at night. She says it's dangerous after dark. Oh. That wasn't-- Sorry. --a joke. So we're going to put you in the drum room for today. All right. - You want this in here as well? - Yeah. All right. [crash] So sorry. It's all right. I'm really sorry. All right, so look good here? Good. Oh, cool. [buzzing] [crash] I'm really, really, really sorry. I'm really sorry guys. And just-- I'm sorry. Yeah. Just step into my office. That was unique and original. They were accidents. There were all accidents. Yeah. Right. OK, any time you're ready. What? Oh, right. All right, well, let's-- let's start. Guys. Any time you're ready, guys. Let's go. Let's jam. They're not doing anything. Hit the button. Let's go. Let's play. After I get levels. After he-- after he gets the levels. Thanks. Yeah. Greg, play a few chords for me, will you, please? [guitar strumming] [drums] OK, thanks, Trevor. That's good enough, thank you. All right. Thank you, guys. Guys, let's try a rehearsal when you're ready. [MUSIC PLAYING - TREBLE CHARGER, "FRIEND OF MINE"] (SINGING) Funny tortured mind. It happens all the time. It's not too encouraging, you never pray for anything. What makes you so great? Something I would indicate? The never-ending train [inaudible] can't help the similarities. [inaudible] everywhere. Where you going now? Doesn't matter. Maybe you guys should take a break. Trust me? They were really good. Uh-huh. What am I supposed to do now? I do the board. You do the band. At the club, they were so good. Mm-hmm. No, I mean, they sounded so cool. I mean, you should have heard them, they were just having such a great time. They were having a great time. They were having a great time. And now they're nervous. They don't want to blow it. It's their big opportunity. They want to be perfect. Zal. How do we make them relax? It's not my job. You're the producer. Get in there. All right. It's pretty bad. Huh. Thanks a lot. Yeah, that's real supportive. We don't need this. All right, let's pack it up. OK, hang on a second. Man, what did you bring us here for? What are we doing here? To make a record. But if you guys want to quit, you know, you can get your stuff, you can hop out. And I don't-- you know, I can understand that. We don't want to quit. We don't want to quit. I thought you're on our side. I am. You know, let's just turn this stuff off, just sit back and relax and talk. You know, whatever comes out, whatever, you know. You really vice president like it says in this magazine? I know. I am. It's hard to believe though, isn't it? Yeah, it's kind of crazy. I mean, that stuff. I don't know. I'm just-- you know, they hired me just for my face, for my looks. Just another pretty face. Yeah. I know what that's like. So is it hard for you guys to get gigs and whatnot? You know, when you're just starting out? Oh, yeah. Promoters want to book bans people have heard of, you know? But until you play a big club, nobody's heard of you. Right. Can't get media coverage unless you set something on fire. Right. So do you then play like a lot of freebies? Yeah, we'll play, you know, like, warehouse parties, after hours parties, things like that. Just so you can get people to hear you? Yeah, we just keep going at it. Cool. At the club, you guys-- you did something. I think, Bill, you did something on the guitar. It was like, [imitating guitar]. Oh, yeah. That little guitar lead thing. Yeah. Can you do that? Can I hear that? Yeah. Yeah, I know. That'd be great. [playing guitar] Yeah. Is it-- is it possible, with all those tools you got there, can you put more a repeating kind of echo onto it? Is that possible? Like a delay pedal, maybe. Sure. Maybe like a little more clarity. Yeah. Perfect. Perfect. Now, when he was doing-- does that sound cool? Sounds good. Sounds good. Sounds more melodic. Yeah, exactly. When you were doing that, I think you were also-- when he was playing that, you were doing something. Guitar, I can't remember exactly what it was. You know-- do you what I'm talking about? Like this? [bass rumble] Yes, exactly. Nice. All right, can I-- just for me, can I hear both of you guys play together? Just kind of like keeping it simple, like the same song or something? Sure. Three, four-- [playing together] That's great. Yeah, sounds good. Is it-- because I just want to hear you guys do it. You're coming awfully fast. Can you-- is it possible just to-- Take it down? Slow it down a bit? Can we do that? Sure. That's good. Let me hear that. Three, four-- [playing together] Yeah that sounds good. Yeah. A little more laid back. It's like-- it's like it's got that-- it's the same song, but it's got a whole new-- It's got a different feel to it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but if you guys are going to simplify it, then it makes sense for me to simplify the drum part, too. Yeah, definitely. Do it. Let's hear it. All right, let me try it. Keep that going. [playing together] Yes. That sounds really good. OK, I'm thinking if we keep it at that tempo, and we build it in the chorus, we can sort of build up some harmonies in the chorus, give us some dynamics. You can take every second line or something? Yeah, harmony. No, trust me. You're the musician. You take, dude. All right, do it. Let's take it from the chorus. Ready? Three, four-- (SINGING) I'll make no claim on your design. I will not call you a friend of mine. I cannot not follow your disguise. I will not. I will not. Oh, sounds great. It's a whole new song. Yes. It's amazing. Amazing. That was great. Guys, let's lay one down. Let's get the earphones on. Let's start the microphone. Let's lay it down. Get the headphones on and the guitar keys up and whatever you guys do. OK. From the top. All right. They got it. They're relaxed, having a great time. I got a feeling. Oh! Let's play this thing. Let's get it going. Come on. Let's go, all right? Rock and roll, just a minute. Anytime you're ready, guys. You know, we're rolling, so you guys can do it. [MUSIC PLAYING - TREBLE CHARGER, "FRIEND OF MINE"] (SINGING) Funny tortured mind. It happens all the time. It's not too encouraging. You never prayed for anything. What makes you so great? Something I would indicate? The lamest and the strongest, can't help the similarities. Doesn't seem at all to hear. Is it fair now? Doesn't matter. Backwards through another year. I'll come down, too. Don't tell me what to do. I make no claim on your design. I will not call you a friend of mine. I cannot follow your disguise. I will not. I will not. I'm not sure what you say makes any difference anyway. Tell me what you mean with any hope of coming clean. It's brought to you too late now, but I appreciate the never-ending sameness we've had days like this before. I will not call you a friend of mine. I will not call you a friend of mine. I will not call you a friend of mine. I will not I will not. Ugh. [music playing] Hey! Huh! What do you think you're doing? Gosh. Oh, what? This. This! Oh, it's morning. Please stop it. Oh, yeah, it's morning. Oh, what time is it? What the heck difference does it make? Do you realize what you've done? This, buddy. This! Oh, oh, oh. Tell me you didn't give them a copy. Yeah. Oh, no. I told Simon. You know, I told him. I said, do not bring in some stupid little twerp to screw things up. I don't understand what you're talking about. Please. This is a legal contract, right? That means we are now committed to some no-name bunch of nobodies. So instead of being able to sign a real band, we have to pay your friends. What's all the shouting here? Oh. Please, feast your eyes. They're a good band. You signed this? Where do you suppose we're going to get the money from? Oh my lord. I mean every cent we've got has been slated for the artist advance? And the bidding war? And you and your contract have ended that. We can't compete now. We're dead. Dead. Simon-- [music playing] You know, I don't-- Don't. Don't even do that. Don't go there. All right? All right. Fine. [music playing] Hey, Rob. How's it going, man? Ready for my party, Rob? Can't wait to see all the famous people you're bringing. No. Got my dad's video camera. We-- what? I said no. What part of that do you not understand? What are you talking about? You can't mean you're not coming to my party? Yes, I mean I'm not coming to your party. But you guys don't want me there anyways, because I'm not famous anymore. In all honesty, I don't think I'd come to your party even if I was famous. Hi. Hi. How have you been? Fine. You? Fine. Hey, Larry. Oh, you're talking to us now? Oh my god, I'm so flattered, I don't know what to say. Oh yeah, that's right. You want-- you want a report. OK. Let's see, this morning, I got out of bed. I had breakfast. Larry, that's not fair. Yeah, it is. It's what he wants. He wants details so he can imagine the life he ain't got no more. Come on, Larry. That's mean and cruel. And I really think-- Helen. Helen. Larry's right. What? I've been a real jerk. And I was wrong. You guys are my friends. And I didn't treat you with the respect you guys deserve. I'm really sorry. I apologize. That's supposed to do it, right? Just make everything cool? No, it's not. All right. All right. And they say guys never talk. Girls, right? Can't live with them-- --would not want to try. Look at you two lovebirds. What? Shut up. Yeah. You all got to start showing me some more respect, though, because I am Larry McGuire. First. OK, you got it. Excuse me. Hey. [MUSIC PLAYING - TREBLE CHARGER, "FRIEND OF MINE"] VOCALIST: (SINGING) Funny tortured mind. It happens all the time. It's not too encouraging you never prayed for anything. What makes you so great? Something I would indicate. The lamest and the strongest, can't help the similarities. Doesn't seem at all to hear. Is it fair now? Doesn't matter. Backwards through another year. I'll come down, too. Don't tell me what to do. I'll make no claim on your design. I will not call you a friend of mine. I cannot follow your disguise. I will not. I will not. [MUSIC PLAYING - PAT BENATAR, "RIVER OF LOVE"] (SINGING) Oh whoa, oh whoa. Oh whoa. Oh whoa. Oh whoa. Oh whoa. Oh whoa. Oh whoa. Hey baby, won't you sit down here next to me. Yeah, I heard you're having trouble in love. Yeah, I know how that can be. Love can hurt. I know it's true. Let me see what I can do. I know a place where you can find love. I screwed up really big, Larry. Come on. It can't be all that bad, man. No, see, it really is, since I like single-handedly ruined a company. You did what you thought was right. That's nothing. RADIO DJ: Here it is again, something brand new from Tone Records, and I can't get enough of it. It's Treble Charger, with "Friend of Mine", on 108.1. What? [MUSIC PLAYING - TREBLE CHARGER, "FRIEND OF MINE"] What's up, man? This is my song. That's the song. No, this is my song. It's my song. That's the band from Lee's Palace. Y'all went to Lee's Palace without me? I got to call Tone Records. Here. Yo, how come you all didn't ask me to come? Rhonda, hi. It's Rob. Can I talk to Simon, please. Right now. Rob! Simon! My band, it's on the radio! I know! What happened? Everything's happening. We got a press conference. What about me ruining everything? Well, I was wrong. I mean, I was completely wrong about it. We can talk about it in the limo. No, Simon, I think I'm going to stay here with my friends. What? Are you nuts? Go. - Yeah man, go. Go. Go, man. All right. Is this cool? Just remember where you come from. And who you owe it all to. Yeah. And the people that like you. Call me. Tonight. Woohoo! [MUSIC PLAYING - TREBLE CHARGER, "FRIEND OF MINE"] (SINGING) --your design. I will not call you a friend of mine. I cannot follow your design. I will not. I will not. Louie has been playing that all morning. [phone rings] Simon Eckstal. Oh, Holly. Mm. Yeah, he's sitting right here with me. Holly, Holly. Shut up, Holly. Rob's going to produce it. I don't care. This is his. Goodbye, Holly. Well, Rob. I took the master of your tape to Larry Mihail. We have paper. What does that mean? Larry is going to release the single you produced over the weekend and the album as well. So it looks like you're going to have to stick around. Look, Rob. You did what I should have done, what I used to do. You went out and found a new band, a great band, and you gave them a chance. So? So we do a few interviews. No. I don't want to do any more interviews. And you get back in the studio with the band and produce another record, another disk. Mr. Vice President. [music playing] He's doing just what I wanted him to do. All along, I knew he had it. [laughs] [music playing] (SINGING) Sometimes the pieces just seem to fit. It is so hot in here. It's youth personified. Look at this. The '70s got to me. I don't know what happened. I really don't. It was all a blur. (SINGING) Standing in the middle of a room, it's like roulette. My lucky number just came up, and I've got no regrets. Everything looks good from the top of the world. Hope I never come back down. I can see it all from the top of the world, [inaudible].. [laughter] (SINGING) And I like it here, I like it here. 'Cause everything's clear at the top of the world. Come on, baby, come on. Let's shag rotten, baby. Come on. Yes, I mean I'm not coming to your party. Do you understand that? OK. [laughter] (SINGING) --sand. Standing in the middle of a room that starts to spin. Your lucky number just came up-- I think it's time for a kid to finally show the world that we're more than just tax deductions and business behaviors. Oh my gosh. [laughter] (SINGING) When you're flying high at the top of the world, hope you never come back down. You can see it all from the top of the world, 'cause you're lying on the clouds. So come up to here, come up to here, where everything's clear, at the top of the world. I can't remember how or why or when I got here. I only know I'm ten feet tall and looking down on everything. Everything. It's so good at the top of the world, hope you never come back down. Everything looks good from the top of the world. Hope I never come back down. I can see it all from the top of the world, 'cause I'm lying on the clouds. And I like it here. I like it here. 'Cause everything's clear in the top of the world. Top of the world. Top of the world. Top of the world. Top of the world. Mick, I think you're overplaying a bit.
