I want to talk to you About your plan to give Karena her own fashion line Never mind that There's a lot on my mind Is there something wrong? Why do you assume something's wrong? Isn't this a product of Muse's company? Yes This is a concept We thought of many years ago... What's so funny? I just feel so lucky My love one is taking my measurement Remember this next time we argue What if we put the pencil, measuring tape And all these things Into a gift box and sell it to the mass market Can't you stop working? Isn't it good? Allow the customers to take measurement of their love one Choose the style, material then put to order And their men will receive it back in the post A shirt measured by their love ones How warm is that I've already got a name for it The Lovely Shirt I've heard this is selling really well Have you talked to her about dividends? I'm a man of my words Why would I ask for dividends? So you are, and as you are a man of your words You can give Karena her own fashion line I never said or promised such things You are lying, a big fat liar! I'm in charge here! Don't change the subject, back to my problem I want to go and speak to Muse But she's been avoiding me Now she send me this Do you think it means that she still has feelings for me? Maybe You think so too? If that's what you think But I think she might still be angry at me Are there any excuses For me to go to Hangzhou for her? What are you doing? Colouring in the clothes Hello This is from me to you, here... Why don't we go somewhere else I'll book the place, alright? Yeah Slow down My friend helped me out with the factory We must drink to the occasion Tony, here, drink up Next time, your girl's not happy Men are brothers, women are laundry! Come on It's been 10 years? Muse, I've looked for you many times I know, but you couldn't find me Of course, with your businesses thriving That's why I came as soon as I received this You haven't forgotten? How could I, it reminds me so much of our past Why don't we talk over dinner? You still have an appetite? Why wouldn't I?! You're going bankrupt and you are still so happy? Me? Going bankrupt?! Your sister told me everything What did she say? She said, according to market reports Men will no longer wear underpants And that the business of men underpants... Will go under in 3 years You believed that? Of course I don't believe that. But I do believe you are having problem with your business Yes, there are problems Yes, I need help badly I'm going bankrupt! That's why I'm here to ask for help I can help you out, but you need to promise me one thing No problem, just tell me I want your designers to come up with a female fashion line If I'm happy with it I'll consider helping you out And release a female fashion line together Alright, what is it? The theme is... Men as Clothes I think Muse is playing you? It was me who was in the wrong But as a female fashion line This theme is rather interesting Since Muse has made such a request We have to work hard together To do our best on this project Don't worry about it, I'll take good care of it Everyone will chip in on this project Karena worked all night And made a plan of action Karena, go on... I think we should start... Before you carry on I have something to announce To make sure the success of this project I have employed an extra team to help An extra team? Yes... Why didn't I know?

Do you think what my uncle said is funny? Sorry, this is not what I mean Boss, you said Muse Has asked our designer to design a fashion line For her to decide if she'll be happy with it Then I believe it should be a fair competition I'm one of the company's designer I suggest we each make our design And let Muse chooses Well done! I'm behind you! Yeah... Our chances of winning will increase with an extra design If the boss agrees Then we'll use this project To decide the winner If I lose, I'll leave this company...

What's the problem? Let's change Get your hair done, a change of clothing You look completely different But the vibe you give is important Just look at the smugness on Karena's face That does not work Do not copy her I'm going for a sense of cool Can any of you feel the cool? Miss Yu, how should this form be fill? Is it this one or this? Hey, look at this... How many are there? And... It's very good, it can go up That's it... It can't UP! It's dangerous, you might fall YES! That's all What were you asking me? I want to know Which account should I work from? You fill in the yellow form first And take it to my room for me to sign Thank you, Miss Yu You're welcome Who is...? He is... I am... He is a model What? What? What? I am I am a model Can't you tell from the pose I've struck I am the top teen model... You are a teen model? I started late And I look old for my age Don't believe me? I'll show you my catwalk I didn't know There are model of your type? I am more famous then you'd know! Let's meet in my office Your office... What's wrong with my office? You'll know when you get there Let's go Hold me, I don't want to twist my ankles Be careful! Don't worry. We are holding you! We go first. You go first. Mind your head Be careful, mum What are you doing? Your office has been assigned to Miss Jojo No way? Boss has sent out a memo Don't worry, I've saved a good seat for you with excellent feng shui Where? Your desk is here Miss Yu Mum, what should we do? Calm ourselves down, and get to work Auntie... When you were facing Jojo You were still a bit scared Can you tell? I don't know why it happens when I am face to face with her That won't work, if you lose, it must be with dignity But I've found a solution over the internet A yoga course that's perfect for you two A smile can hide all secrets If you always put on a knowing smile Then no one can guess what you are really thinking What yoga teaches this? The infamous Yoga guru Richard Billiham Laughing Yoga Is it difficult? It's simple, all you need is a mirror Just so happen, I have one here Look at the mirror, and laugh at yourself It'll a bit awkward to start with But the key to success is Fake It Till You Make It The more you laugh, the more it is real Movie imitates life, it's all an act! Are you sure? Of course Karena and I will go first Just follow my lead Laugh if you know how How come the designers haven't arrived yet? They are all busy Partying every night, they don't get up so early Then think of other ways To get them to come? We can go clubbing to meet with them That's a waste of time, we can't out drink them We'll be down before we start They seems so happy Why are they so happy? They've got a plan What plan? I don't know... Meeting & diagram They do seems to be onto something I'm telling you, tea time is about to finish If we don't call now, then we'd missed tea It's just a takeaway, why so complicated? Well, you two will argue otherwise Both of you want mixed meat balls I've heard both your arguments And drawn this out Efficiency and Cost Are they discussing what factory to use? Taste as well? Are they going for zero pollution's material? I suggest, both of you compromise We go for McYungkee Because their taste Healthiness, price & quantity Are the most average The area is the largest But there is something to McYungkee Their plain fish ball and beef ball are $20 with 6 per bowl But their mixed meat balls are $22 also for 6 per bowl It's more expensive by $2 To explain this I'll need another diagram Right Demand curves goes down Which means when you continue to use a product Increases Each increment will have a decrement on your enjoyment For example, a bowl of plain fish balls has 6 You'd enjoy the first three more than the last three The same goes for beef balls The first three will be more enjoyable than the last three And when you add the areas It represents how much you are willing to pay For a bowl of plain fish ball or beef balls Alright Even though the boss of McYungkee Thinks we are willing to pay the extra $2 But that does not matter Togetherness is the key We don't need to order mixed meat balls You order plain fish balls, you beef balls We redistribute them You give her 3 fish balls, you give her 3 beef balls So, the amount of beef balls and fish balls stay the same But the value of the meat balls Increases Under this scenario We use minimal amount of money, with maximum enjoyment And the greatest return, take that Jojo, look like they have a great plan Will we lose? 20 bowls of beef balls, 20 bowls of fish balls, excellent You've have beaten my boss' evil plan Of course What are you guys doing? Hey You're looking beautiful, in love? Beautiful, right? Quite good... Brother? You must be brother! You two... Just our new staff Teen model Teen model? Yeah I'm more famous than you can imagine! Brother, my name is Fai Why don't you pay for this? Why me? We've got a new colleague, uncle Yeah You haven't paid a long time Stop being so stingy Get the money from the boss, I'll deal with the meat balls How much? $850 These for $850? Cigarettes too Change You don't need change, looking so good Alright, eat up and back to work YEAH! Couldn't tell you are so good at everything, knows I.T. Method acting And all those diagrams, you studied a lot? Quite a bit If you studied so much Why are you doing lifestyle extra? Just keeping myself And my dream alive Dream, that's a word I haven't heard for some time My dream is to make a popular App To hit it big Can you hit it big with an app? Do you know there's an app called Draw Something It was sold for 1.8billion US dollars Wow, but is that a dream? Isn't that a bit unreal Mum, what dreams are real?

Didn't work, he was crazy I swam with him for three hours He didn't say yes You're useless, I thought he is your cousin, it's simple He doesn't need money He doesn't want to work, I've ran out of ideas... Wait All we want is Owen's contact list If we can get hold of them We can call the designers ourselves Theoretically yes, but he keeps his phone with him What's he doing? Sauna No one take phones to sauna, right I'll go in and steal it now You sound like you steal a lot, it breaks the law You can go to jail, don't try it There are loop holes we can get pass We can upload his contacts onto cloud Then download to my phone If he doesn't know that it happened He doesn't really suffer any loses That's it then, let's go... Let me... You are just a girl, you're not going in Who'd marry you if you get caught Let me do it Wait... Do you know what you're doing?

You'll know soon enough Mum, be careful Good stuff Give it back Why are you doing this? Don't you know? Sauna's high temperature Can kill our sperms and cause impotence Putting ice down there Will protect sperms from getting hurt You want kids? I have always loved kids You are so popular with the girls You can just ask one to bare your child You think it's all fun and games being Lucky Owen? They just want me as a stepping stone To their next guy No matter how serious they look But it's all in my head To act normal When breaking up, I always pretend that I don't care But it hurts I didn't know you suffered so much So it's useless taking such good care You can't say that I'm such a nice guy, maybe I'll meet someone I should save the best for her What is this, what does this phone wants I thought it was just a few taps This is crazy!

Never had been better A month went by so quickly Today we'll see the work Both of you have done for "Men as Clothes" Jojo, you go first... Yes Men only want to have a fresh relationship But women always try to keep a relationship fresh I believe 21st century women Could also have a fresh relationship Rather it's men or clothes It should be kept As fresh, crisp and beautiful as possible Let me introduce, memory fabric series 24 This dress is made with memory metal And memory fabric The dress have a lifespan of 24 hours In this 24 hours The dress will change continuously According to our inputs To display different style Every piece will be one of its kind It will always be fresh and beautiful Jojo, this is amazing And it fits the theme very well I like it Thank you... Alright, done Let's go Still got aunties Really? Should we stay? Of course I have not met a lot of men in my life But luckily, those I know Have given me a lot of love So I think if you really like a piece of clothes It's the same as when I love a man I don't want to throw it away I will want to keep it for life Wear it everyday That's why I've used this concept To create our "Men as Clothes" series... Isn't this the pyjamas you won't throw away? It only looks like it The greatest thing about this design Is not only models look good in it Everyone can too This series is made from the best cotton 2000 threads, so it's very soft Its shape will never change Even after years It will be as beautiful and closer to your heart If this is produced by Muse I think it'll sell for over 10 thousand dollars But if we are doing a cross over With a mass market strategy It can sell for under 300 dollars At this price, every women Can have their own There are more than 10 billion people in China Half of them are female I'll be very rich Thank you for your presentation Jojo's design is brave, unique Stylish & very modern CT's design is warm and touching I'm sorry Jojo But I like CT's design more Because she completely convinced me On her take on "Men as Clothes" Congratulations, CT!
