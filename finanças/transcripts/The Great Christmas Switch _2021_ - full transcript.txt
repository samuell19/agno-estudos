I've sworn off dating till... until the new year. - But you're always begging me to set you up with a good guy... - Yes. No, I know I keep dating the same type of guy, and it doesn't work out and I don't learn my lesson, but please, no. Exactly why I'm setting this up. No excuses. Mm-mm. I... Okay, I would love to meet Grayson... the week after Christmas. Looks like tomorrow night works just great for Grayson. - Megan, I'm serious. I... - Oh, my God, babe... you don't have to thank me.

Megan will be suspicious if you don't. And what if Grayson is the love of my life, and another girl snatches him p before I can meet him? Do you want to have that on your conscience forever? Stop sighing. Dating is a number's game. And I didn't want to go to prom with Patrick, but I did it for you. The very least you can do is go on this date with Grayson for me. A lot of my properties go for seven or eight figures. - - Wow. ot - I collect sports cars. I've got a Ferrari, a Lamborghini, a limited-edition Bugatti. Well, I used to collect vintage records and I... I am hoping to get a Pagani to my collection next, but... we'll see. So.

In... in a guy. Hmm. Um, a best friend. - Mm-hmm. - Someone who loves me and listens to me. Someone who... doesn't work around the clock, so they have time to help with the kids and the house and the dog and the meals and the laundry and getting everyone everywhere like a taxi. Someone who doesn't get upset when I don't have any more energy to give any more at the end of the day... - Someone who doesn't get upset wh-Kids, yeah. - Ve Mm-hmm. To give any more at - Someone who... ay... Appreciates me and doesn't take me for granted and doesn't take their work stress out on me. - Yeah... - 'Cause, you know... - Ahem. -... like, no one gets married expecting it to end. People change.

Trust me, he was not for you. I told you, dating is hard. You are so lucky you found your person in high school. Well, we know how that turned out. Although, on our first date, Patrick brought me a sunflower. And he held open all the doors and he paid for everything like a true gentleman. Hey, speaking of Patrick and the kids, I don't want you to worry about anything. Okay? Keep enjoying yourself. You deserve this... Hang on. I think someone's in the house. Oh, no. Did you forget to lock the pantry? If Austin gets into the garbag, he's gonna be sick on the carpt and I just had them cleaned. Gross.

I almost clobbered you! - What are you doing? - W-Okay, I, uh... a do Austin got into the trash and... I got most of it. You guys forgot to lock the pantry. - What are you doing here? - I had to get some tools and towels from the basement. You couldn't have done that in the morning and not scared me to death? Your tree is gigantic. It's... it's crooked. - Well, I blame Sebastian. - I can fix it of you want me to. No, I like it. It's the leaning tree of Christmas. You like this? You? Well, I'm not that stringent. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm a little bit stringent. Oh, you... You remember this? Myrrh from the first Christmas? Um... Gosh. So we started dating in high school, so that would've been... what year? First Christmas after we got married. - Right. - You know... Remember we went to three different stores, trying to find the perfect ornaments? Right, right, right. Uh, hey, I've got... I've gotta wash this mask off my face, 'cause it's drying. Do you... want a coffee for the road? I stopped drinking coffee six years ago, remember? I'm gonna go wash this mask off my face. So what are you up to this evening? Oh, some friends are having a holiday party at the beach, and then tomorrow, my roommate's havingto an uglysweater party. Hmm. Wow. You really do have a fun social life.

Really? Since when? Oh... you know. It's not perfect, but... No, it's great. You're gonna be the hit of the toy drive. You know, I hope whoever gets this loves it as much as I did. I'm sure they will, honey. I never even wore this. Yeah, I don't blame you. You bought it for me. Yeah, I mean, you should wear it, because... floral ruffles are coming back. Hey, everybody.

And sadly, no phone call. That's because I'm being Then wondmysterious.ondering. You're making my vacation very mysterious indeed. - Your vacation? - Th-I work part-timeeing Theat the fire department, ng. But my main job is teaching American history and coaching track at the high school. Oh, I bet you took that job for the summers off. I plead the fifth. A. Though I do genuinely love history. I plead the fifth. A. Ah! If I recall, I got an A on my History of Christmas paper senior year. Oh, yeah? Golden star for you. But you know what? I don't have one on me right now. Then I'll just take that cup of coffee instead. They look really good. So what I love most about teaching is showing the... Oh. - Thank you. - Here you go. Enjoy. Thank you, Alex. Yeah, what I love most is showing the kids how... past events influence today's decisions, beliefs and actions. I would've paid a lot more attention in school if my teachers were as passionate as you. Well, I do my best. Okay, if you could go back to any time in history, what would you choose? Mm. The Roaring Twenties. That's interesting. Why? Well, with the economic prosperity after World War I, it was an era of artistic, cultural and social vivacity. Jazz, flappers, withmodern technologies;rity women won the right to vote. Just... everything about that decade was novel and exciting. Yeah. Yeah, I guess that would've been an amazing time to experience. If only we could find a time machine. Hey, well, uh, okay. If only we could find a ne. What about you? Same question. Huh. The golden age of piracy? Mm. Wow. Just sail around and find some gold and treasure and spice. You know, live the life.? Aye. I could see you as another Anne Bonny or Mary Read. Mm. Thanks, matey. Um... Oh, boy. It's been two hours. - Wow. - How did that happen? Um... I really, really enjoyed this, but I really have to go. So thank you for the Christmas latte. You're welcome. I hope we can do this again soon. Yeah, so do I. Bye. Bye. Kaelynn. Where you been? I've been calling and texting you for, like, 1.5 hours. I'm so sorry. I lost track of time. Whe-It's not like youeen to be so irresponsible. I said I was sorry. I was worried! The kids were worried. I-I missed my meeting. - Oh, I wish I had that time machine right now. - What? Look. It won't happen again. I, um... I just have to finish wrapping. - Hmm. - Hey, girl. - Hey. So how did it go with Grayson? Oh, no. Not gonna happen. He is not the one. Sophia, honey, you've gotta stop being so picky. I used to think so, too. But it is not a bad thing to have standards. Okay, so let's say Grayson isn't the right one. Right? No. Nope. But if you don't lower your expectations, you're gonna end up alone. No one's perfect. Right. No one's perfect. That's... true. I'm certainly the first to admit I'm not. What happened?! Are the kids okay? I-I have to leave for the farmers' market and, uh, I'm blocked in. Oh, no. I-I need you to move your car? Oh, I'm so sorry. I... didn't think you were going today. 'Cause of the... ugly-Christmas-sweater party. Wait. That's not until tonight. Oh. Do you want me to make something? You... you said you were going to make your famous Christmas cheesecake. Right. Of course I did. You know, that's actually my sister's recipe that I'm trying to pass off as my own. - Green aventurine. - What? It promotes calmness and joyfulness. - Green aventurine. Oh.? Yeah, I'm calm, I'm joyful. Green aventurine. Ah-ha. The kids... What? Mm... donate. This... Keep. Definitely donate. Hey. Uh... what do you mean, the kids are great? - Oh, yeah, they're with me. Didn't I tell you that? - No. You absolutely did not tell me that and you know it. Uh... yeah, so Patrick's dad was sick, and they had to cancel the trip to Florida. Sophia, I can't believe you didn't tell me that! Just because you didn't want to come back to work? I mean... Ugh. I'm booking the first flight back. No. No, I didn't tell you because you've been so stressed lately, and I wanted you to enjoy some time away. You always do everything for everyone else and put yourself last, and I thought you could just relax and soak in some ocean air and have fun with my friends. Okay, well, I appreciate that and I know you meant well, but it's Christmas and I want to be with my kids. Okay, well, I appreciate that and I know No! meant well, All the flights into Cleveland are cancelled because of blizzards. Okay, okay, that's nothing we can do about it right now. And worrying doesn't help, so... go have fun at the sweater party. I'll keep checking the airport and weather status. When did you become the reasonable twin? I dunno. Having kids will do that to you. I can't believe they haven't figured out it's not me. Okay, to be fair, I have been keeping my distance from Patrick, and the kids really only know their Aunt Sophia with long, blond hair, so... Yeah, I guess so. I am their mother. They also think you're having some kind of... post-separation midlife crisis. Sophi... Yeah, okay, great. Yeah, that would explain it. - So keep me posted. - Bye. - Bye. Merry Christmas! HHo-ho-ho! o! - Mom, look! It's Santa and Mrs. Claus. - Oh. Okay, put your donations on the table for the lady. Merry Christmas. I'm so proud of you two. Sometimes we forget there are people who don't have as much as we do. Yeah. I'm glad we could help all these kids have a great Christmas too. Oh, wow. Looks incredible. - Oh, boy. - What? Um, nothing. Why don't we go home and make those cookies? Okay, come on. - Um... see you in a bit, buddy. - Yeah. Can we see Santa and Mrs. Claus, please? - Yes, of course, you can. - Yes! - Okay, great. I'll see you in just a couple of minutes. - Okay. - Jonathan. - Hey. I thought that was you. Um, I didn't expect to see you here. - The fire department is one of the Christmas Drive sponsors, - Hey. I thouso... hat was you. That's great. That's really great. - Th-Did you tell Santa one of the Chwhat you want? sponsors, - Hey. I tho-Um... at was you. No, I didn't. I told Mrs. Claus. She has the better track record. Ah. Well, then I better make sure to let her know what my Christmas wish is. Oh, what's that? No. I'm not gonna tell. I can't tell you. It might not come true. Okay, well, give me a hint. Okay. Um, it might have something to do with New Year's Eve, and getting a date with this... beautiful, intelligent woman I recently met. Oh. I, uh, I hope your wish comes true. Me, too. What are you doing later? Um, I have plans. I'm doing some family stuff. - Ah. I figured, but I thought I'd ask anyway. - Hey, John! Um, I have plans. Um... if your plans change... give me a call. I'd love to see you. Okay. Sebastian, don't eat the cookie dough. Why? Mom's doing it. Why can't I? Yeah, I'm living life on the edge. Oh! Mom, these cookies are the best! I have a confession to make. I stole that recipe from your Aunt Sophia. She was the genius who added the cinnamon. - Is that right? - Hey, look. Look. This is Santa on his sleigh. Mom says it's more creative to use our hands than boring old cookie-cutters. She does? Well, she's... she's right. By the way, Grandpa is doing a lot better. He and Nanna got your cards. They send their love and these Christmas presents, which... you cannot open until Christmas. Um, I'm happy to hear your dad's feeling better. Thanks. Me, too. Hey, Dad, why don't you come and help us finish these cookies? But you have to dance. Come on. - Oh, really? - Not like that. Is that all you got? It looks like you're walking. Hey, there was a big snowstorm on the Christmas Charlotte turned five. You remember that, Kaelynn? Oh, yeah. Hey, Uh, you know what? owstorm ol... I think... I think I heard the dryer. - I didn't hear anything. - No, I gotta get the laundry. Um, I'll be down in a minute. It's a lot of work, looking after a family. I mean, it's worth it. Something you want to talk to me about? I don't think so, no. About your recent coffee date perhaps? Uh... I promise you it is not what you think. I'm married. That was... I'm vetting him for Sophia. - What does your sister have to do with this? - Everything. She hasn't met anyone nice in a really long time. And did I tell you she's actually thinking about moving out here? She'll need a job first, but she did finally work on her résumé. And did I tell you she's actually thinking aboutAnd actually, ere?

You are not my assistant anymore. Hmm. So I guess I'll just handle this, will I? - I guess so. - Hmm. - I'm glad we cleared that up. - Mm. Me, too. And I'd like you to approve my raise. It's been two months. You know I deserve it. Well, Sophia... you're... What-what's wrong? What happened? I just got released from my employment contract. What? Why? Insubordination tops the list, followed by a negative attitude. And, oh, um, did I mention I'm not a team player? Even though I gave up my vacation to work through the holidays? That's... Even though I gave up my vacation to work througOh, man. lidays? Yeah. But she... she's been talking about getting a new job for years, so... So now she just has to. I think you're, uh... I think you're in shock. You're talking about yourself in the third person. She... she... I... I'll-I'll just get something better, right? Something better will come along. This is a good thing. Right? This is a good thing. This is a very good thing. Yeah, absolutely. Pfft... Wow. Ah... we did it, Austin. We emailed my résumé to 22 companies. And this is what we wanted, right, boy? A quiet, peaceful Christmas. Ah. Hey. Hi, Santa. Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas! Hey, Santa! Merry Christmas! - Oh, thank you. - There you go. You're welcome. - Thanks so much for meeting me. - I'm glad you called. Um, I'm not interrupting your Christmas plans, am I? Not at all. I was finishing a shift at the fire department. Have you ever tried roasted chestnuts? No, but I've sung about them. That's funny. Beautiful here, isn't it? Yeah. All we need are some carriage lanterns and a quartet singing The Parade of Wooden Soldiers, and it would be just like your favourite decade, the 1920s. Well, as F. Scott Fitzgerald would say in The Great Gatsby, "That's my Middle-West - the streetlamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow." Wow. Oh, yum! Should I do it? Do it. I've never been married, but I've always wanted a big family, though. - Huh. - How about you? Uh, same. Same. I've been single for a long time. - Hmm. - I thought I was just unlucky in dating, um, but now I'm thinking that maybe... I needed to figure out I thwhat I wanted to dolucky with my life first. I have a hard time believing that nobody's been able to sweep you off your feet. Aw. From what I've seen, you are... stunningly beautiful. Inside and out. Thanks. Maybe I haven't been in the right place... to meet the right guy. Until now? Until now. Kaelynn. - Oh, hey. Hi. - I've been worried about you, being all alone at Christmas, but I can see now I don't need to be. - Oh, have a wonderful holiday. - You, too. Um, it's getting late. I should probably go. - I had a really great time tonight. - I did too. Jonathan, there's something I need to tell you. What is it? Um... I, uh... Um... Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. What's going on, Cloud? I'm... moving out. On, uh, on Christmas? What...? Uh, look, uh... if this is because of me, I'm going to be back to my... easy, breezy self next week, I promise.

You have until New Year to be out. That's next week. I... Look, I have legal rights. It's my apartment and... you didn't sign a lease, so, no, actually, you... you don't.

I didn't know you'd be back so soon. - Sebastian couldn't wait to see what Santa brought! - Yeah! - Oh. - Let's go! - Come on! Sebastian couldn't wait to see what Santa brought! Wait for me! Oh, wow!

This is so much better than Cancun. What? I said... my heart is full in this room. - Hey, Mom, can you help me set this up? - Sure. What's wrong? I need to check the tires. Hang tight. Ah... It's flat. It'll take me a few to change it. The coffee shop's open. I'll get a coffee. Do you want something? My treat. Black with cream, no sugar, would be much appreciated. I'll get you when I'm done. - I'll g-Okay.ffee. - Do you want? My treat. Ooh. - Here you go. - Thank you so much. Here. Merry Christmas. - Oh. Thank you. - You're welcome. - He-Whoa! go...

My sister, she... she likes cold clothes. She... she's quirky. Um... - Okay. - So thanks for the ride. - Um, Kaelynn, about last night... - Kaelynn? Patrick? What...? Uh, who... who is this? He's... uh... he's... he's kind of my, uh... I'm her husband. You're... married. Yes, but it's not what it seems like. I-I think I should go. Um... I'm sorry. I had no idea she's married. I... If I did, I never would've... Thought you were upstairs resting. Oh, I was. I-I am.

Yeah, I was let go. I-I'm sorry. I wasn't ready to tell any of you that, because I was so shocked. I still don't believe it. Well, I'm really sorry to hear that, Sophia. - What's insubordination? - It just means Aunt Sophia's looking for a new job that she enjoys, where she gets paid what she deserves, - What's insubordination? - It just means Aunt Sophia's and treated with respect. That she enjoys, where she gets paid Yes, that's right. Anyway, I still can't stay for too long, because I still have an apartment to get back to. But actually, weren't you telling me... bthat your roommatee an acancelled your lease to. And moved out with her new artist friends? Bthat your roommatee an acan-Yeah, I did. ase to.

I got it, I got it. - Let me move. I got this. - Okay. Right. Set it down. Cool. Now we can look at the moon. Huh? I can't believe you got me fired and evicted.

And the kids are growing up so fast. And I miss my twin sister. I just want to be closer to you all and... Yeah. Plus you can spend some more time with your boyfriend, Jonathan.

It was junior prom, I was sick, Becky MacKinnon had a huge thing for you... - Sophia went as you? - Yeah. Look. Wait. We used to trick our parents all the time. They couldn't tell us apart either. For the record, I wouldn't have just dumped you because you're sick. We usedBut you're notparents all a teenager anymore, dn't so to switch like this now... Okay, I'm sorry. So you enjoy your time in California? Did you like being Sophia? I did, actually. It helped me realize some things. - What, that you just love the single life? - No. As a matter of fact...

We just met today. - Then who was I... - That was me. I'm Sophia. This is... So you're not married? No. Hundred-percent single. Yeah, they've been doing this whole switcheroo game since high school, so, you know, joke's on us. I'm gonna go say goodbye to the kids. I'm sorry. I... Do you think we could, um... What? Pick up where we left off? I-I don't know a single thing about you. You lied to me about everything. No, I didn't. Everything I told you was true. Except my name. And that I live in California. And that I have a twin sister. But I mean, I... I really wanted to tell you. I... I... I really like you. Hmm. Well, you sure have a funny way of showing it, pretending to be someone else. Couldn't we start over? I don't see how I can trust you anymore. You can trust me. I, uh... I don't think I can get past this. Lying by omission is still lying. I'm sorry, Kaelynn - Sophia - whoever you are. So you said you wanted to talk. I'm ready to talk. Honestly, I don't think I have any more to say. So you said yoLet's just talkk. In the lawyer's office. Look. I just didn't want to be home alone. You were supposed to be out of town. I needed a break from my life. I mean I needed a break from me. Like, I... Somewhere in the midst of all go, go, go, I... forgot that we're meant to enjoy our lives, we're supposed to... enjoy the moments while we have them, fbecause in the end, ant I mean, that's all we have. We're supposed to... enjoy the moments while-Go on. them, So this... past week, I... I realized more than ever that I want our life together, I want our family. And I know I need to change things and I'm gonna work on that. But you need to change things, too. Okay. So... from now on, weekends are for family time, and I'm gonna hire a cleaning service so I'm not always so stressed about the house. I mean, we only have so much time before the kids are grown and they're off to college. I mean, we o-Is there more? time We're supposed to be each other's best friends. You know? We need to treat each other with kindness and respect. No more sarcasm, no more... taking each other for granted. You know? We need to treat each other Okay, I can agree to all that. Is there more? Yeah. I want you to take me on dates again. This keeps getting better and better. Yeah, I want you to buy me sunflowers and chocolates, and hold the doors open for me and pay for dinner. And I want you to listen to me sunfllike you used to. tes, Now you're getting pretty demanding. Anything else? Yeah, one more thing. I want you to come home. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for us to get off-track, okay? I didn't... I won't let it happen again, okay? I love you, Kaelynn. I love you, too. Forever. - I just need to add one more thing. - Yeah. What is it? You and Sophia need to promise to never switch on me again. - Okay, I promise. - Okay. - Okay. You hear anything from Jonathan? No. I've sent texts and left messages, but haven't heard back. Well... maybe he just needs more time. It's almost New Year's. You could start with a fresh slate. Or maybe he just doesn't want anything to do with me. Mom said we get the angriest at the people we love the most. So... if he's that mad, he must really love you. I hope that's true, sweetie. Mom and Dad didn't give up on love, so you shouldn't either. - Aw. - You should listen to my girl. She's a smart one. Alright, that's the last of it. Thank you so much for moving my stuff. Ah, it's no problem. I had to get my stuff out of that apartment anyway. So I, uh, I paid the rent forfor six months.f.
