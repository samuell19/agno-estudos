So, no risk of rain today. Just a glorious English summer's afternoon. Welcome to the start of Wimbledon 2008. As is tradition, of course, the defending men's champion will play the first match on the center court. Roger Federer beginning his campaign for a six successive Wimbledon title. I fell in love with Wimbledon because of its tradition, its history that you just feel very honored and privileged to be playing on such a perfectly laid grass court. You know that somebody has been going around with the scissors and making sure that every blade of the grass is perfect. A super performance from the defending champion. Rafael Nadal, clearly, he is a better player than he was even a year ago when he pushed Roger Federer in the final. Well played, Roger Federer. I knew I had played a good tournament and was close to winning. But it was tough at the time, because I didn't know if I would ever have another chance to win Wimbledon. First point for the man from Mallorca. - Just two breaks in the match. - 6-4. But it's a three sets win for Rafael Nadal. He is on his way for Wimbledon 2008. Roger's the greatest balletic mover that tennis has ever seen. One of the greatest ball strikers, you know, phenomenal, you know, beyond belief. Game Federer. The defending champion, yet, to drop a set. And Federer. Federer simply in a different world at the moment. And it's not a world with too many players inhabit. Give him a chance, Roger! He's been in the zone for the last five years here at the all-in club. Oh! A rampant Rafael Nadal in superb form. Rafa has got that intensity and energy that's so debilitating to opponents. So intimidating that it tires you out mentally. Rafael Nadal through to the quarter finals. Unbelievable shot. Too strong. Absolutely relentless. No doubt that there's been some surprises, you know, especially Andy and Novak losing and when you see this draw sort of being narrowed down and you see that Rafael is the big favorite, you know, on the other section, and I'm a big favorite in my section, obviously, you start thinking more about the, you know, a possible final. Game set... It will be six finals in a row for Roger Federer. It will be the dream final. -Federer against Nadal. - Three sets to love. I've seen a lot of tennis matches and I've commentated a lot and watched a lot and played a lot. If you add everything together, there's no question into my mind overall the 2008 match between Rafa and Roger was the greatest tennis match ever. I'm well prepared. I've had a good championship so far, you know, and I always think Rafa as the-- as the test, sort of what I was hoping for. I mean Rafa is a great competitor. And every time I'm going to play him, I want to try to beat him, you know. Federer says I know how to play Rafa, I know what I have to do. Do you know what you have to do to beat Roger Federer on grass? No. No. I'll only try my best, you know, go on court, try to play my best tennis, try to put my rhythm, the intensity and later if he plays better than me and he beats me, just congratulate him like-- like every year. Wimbledon is that distant magical place that you-- across the ocean that had this aura about it and this beauty. There's a magic to Wimbledon that players feel. It is a combination of where you're playing, who you're playing and the quality of tennis. You know, the tension and the excitement, everything is just so close to the forefront of your emotions. The match I played with Borg in '80 was often talked about as one of the greatest, if not the best match that people had seen. And once that great tension in the men's final. A tie break in the fourth set. I think we brought out the best from each other. We gave always a hundred percent. I had this tailor-made like super start. I like to think I made him a better player but he certainly made me a better player. Oh! I knew that I had to bring out my A-game every time I stepped on the court with Martina. Yes. When I played Chris, you know, it's this mind games you play against each other when you know each other that well. Especially when you do have contrasting styles. And Nadal and Federer embody that. The key to a great rivalry is contrast, and you couldn't have more polar opposites. Roger, when he's walking on the Centre Court at Wimbledon looks, so relaxed, just embraces the environment and does it in a way that doesn't use extra energy. Rafa is someone with high energy, high intensity. Look, we've seen what he does with the bottles on the court, likes things in a certain order, wants a lot of stuff done certain ways. I remember seeing Nadal in his sleeveless shirt, bulging biceps. And then right next to him he'd got what looked like a prince. Not a hair out of place. I like that lefty-righty, the way they dress, the way they act, their temperaments, their personalities. Rafa, you know, he's the swashbuckler. But, you know, he's more emotional and he wears his emotions more on sleeves. You can sort of see what he's feeling more. And Roger's, you know, sort of the ever the classy, you know, almost perfect guy like Borg was. So, Federer, twenty-six-year-old, maestro from Switzerland. Number one in the world since February 2004. He's going for title number six. It was something not even the great Swede Bjorn Borg could achieve. It's hard enough to feel the pressure of having to win a tournament. But when you're going for six in a row, I did the six in a row, you know you'll never ever have the chance again, never. So the pressure is exponentially greater. Everybody talked about this match and I was the umpire, the spectator of this beauty. Here comes Roger. The tennis I was able to watch, the-- the players we had, tournament it was. I believe as well, you know, I'm sorry I don't want to feel like a big head, but I believe that officiating was great as well. Roger Federer... Oh-fifteen. It's just fantastic, isn't it? Straight out of the blocks. Both players look like they are timing the ball well, constructing the rallies well. In tennis, you have to put your opponent away. We have to always win the last point to get over the finish line. Each point I play and every ball I hit has the intention, of harassing the opponent. Finding a way for that shot to win me the point. A break-up serve, it is. First bluff to the Spaniard in his attempt to win Wimbledon for the first time. Nadal leads two game to one. I do believe that as a tennis player it's-- it's constant problem solving and trying for solutions and trying out things. On the surface, if you're just watching as a spectator, you might just look, oh, these guys' play so good. But all the little decisions we have to take in every point, in every game, in every match and every tournament, there are so many of them. The biggest difference between any other sport and tennis is that you have nobody else to talk to. You have a coach but he can't talk to them. You have to problem-solve by yourself. Most fundamentally, Federer is a sporting aristocrat. He embodies virtues such as effortlessness, pure skill, talent, artistry. These are reflected both in his person, in the way he carries himself and more fundamentally in the way he plays tennis. Nadal stands for effort and its associated qualities-- endurance, muscle power, fortitude, stamina. And those fundamental differences which are there all the time when they play each other, they really come to a head. I think that's probably the biggest difference how they both feel the game. Roger with a lot more flexibility on-- on what he does because of his God-given talent. And Rafa with his tenacity and his will to win. The opponent serves and then you need to return. So you have to go from something that is very explosive, very athletic, to something calm, with a lot of feeling, with anticipation and harmony. And to combine these two opposites results in a good game. A loss at set point. This is top tennis now. Tennis is a very cerebral game. You have to be able to deal with the ups and downs. An advantage for Federer. We are back to this game. The point is you have to know yourself. Oh. That's a real body blow. Advantage Nadal. Game for a set. Nadal. Sixth game to four. I believe doubts are good because they keep you alert at all times, regardless of your opponent. Never considering myself good enough and always having that doubt Constantly pushes me to improve. I think he played way better than me. I wasn't able to do anything. I didn't play as well as the other days, like I wanted to play, but, whatever. I'm a big believer that behind every champion there is a force, there is a father, there is a mother, there is a grandmother, there is a coach, there is somebody that actually is a force behind this individual. Rafael began to train as a kid, every day. Every day, every single day of his life, as if it was a tennis tournament. As if he was playing a final. I always thought that to make it to the top... would be hard, and that we would have to face many kinds of problems. That's why I always tried to foster in Rafael a tough personality, to be able to withstand such difficulties. My ambition would be to get to the highest level. But for the moment, I'm here, I'm 112 in the world, and there's still a long way. You have to keep trying, improving, everything. It's not easy at all. Well in that time he wasn't the Nadal that we all know now. I was practicing with him very frequently in Mallorca, so we knew each other very well. During that time I won a Grand Slam, I was number one in the world. I remember that in practice I almost always beat him, but once you began to play with him on the court, he turned into a machine. The first time we played an official tournament was in Hamburg. I started playing professionally when I was very young, 16, so I was not as strong as the other players. Because the ball came to him a bit faster, he hit it a bit late... and he began to lift his arm more than he was supposed to. And he realized that was also helping him win. He's able to play a type of tennis that hadn't been seen before. Making it so quickly to the professional circuit, made me find solutions to be competitive and that's the truth. A sixteen-year-old has just put up one of the world's best players. But it's clear that he had a killer instinct inside the court, an ambition that I could only wish I had half of. The tournament you'd most like to win? Wimbledon. This was Federer's house. This is where he was unbeatable. Nobody beat this guy. And Nadal was trying to bring his clay-court game, his baseline game, to bear on the grass at Wimbledon. Fifteen-Oh. We talk about the intensity of Rafael Nadal and we don't talk about that with-- with Roger. He's so relaxed, so this and that, yeah, yeah. But when the ball is hit, the intensity level is exactly the same. Federer definitely looking like he's finding that rhythm, that groove on his serve, which we've seen, which has been ever present this tournament. Okay, boys, good luck to you both. There's a difference between a brilliant tennis player and a champion. And many brilliant tennis players don't become champions. And until you taste victory at the very highest level, you don't know how to do it. Game, set match, Federer. You always dream about it. You go and play with your friends when you're ten years old and you-- you go on-- on the lawn in the backyard and you play Wimbledon there. And finally, after years of underachievement, Federer wins Wimbledon. Now I'm-- I'm much more relaxed going into Grand Slams just because I don't have to prove it like I used to. Game, set match, Federer. And Roger Federer has confirmed his ranking as the number one player in the world in emphatic fashion. I think when Roger arrived on tour, he put the tennis to another level. To him, Wimbledon is the most important tournament, it's always the tournament he wants to win. Federer just kept on beating everybody. I think he really has a passion for the game. Otherwise he would never have gone this far. Federer's game is very much dialogue with tennis' past. You see some of Borg's smoothness around the court, you see the explosive side of Sampras, you see a bit of Laver. He took elements of the old style. And on top of that, he superimposed a very powerful topspin baseline game. When something looks easy, it does not mean that it's easy. It means that Roger is able to do something very difficult. Yes! He's a lot more complex than the majority of players, much more creative. Actually when I was young, I never thought I could play tennis the way I'm playing it right now. I always knew there was some hidden talent in me with my strokes and with my style of play, but that I could actually explore it as much as I did now. It's for me also a big surprise. Roger Federer is the greatest all-around talent I've ever seen. So he's up among, you know, the greatest of all time. Let's be honest, Borg won five in a row, okay, five in a row, and that's along with six French's. So that's why you have to put him up there in the highest echelons of the sport. If he stays up at this level, he's going to have at least a couple more Wimbledon, he's going to win at least another Open or so, an Australian, and he's going to challenge for the French. I mean without a doubt this guy's got by far and away the best chance to-- to win the French Open. Then Nadal came along and put a pressure on him that he's just-- he's never had before. Roger Federer coming out for what is undoubtedly the most significant match in his entire career to date. For the first time he is playing in the final of the French Open at Roland Garros. At the moment Roger Federer is in a long list of great champions who've never won at Roland Garros. McEnroe, Connors, Sampras, of course, Edberg, Becker. They could never master the red clay. Rafael Nadal, 2005, who came here and became the first man since Mats Wilander to win the title on his first appearance. He's looking today for his sixtieth successive victory on clay courts. Rafa is born to compete against Roger. First, Rafa is lefty. He's right in life but he's lefty on the tennis court. You don't have many lefty in the top hundred, so you-- you don't practice much with lefty and you don't play much against lefties on the tour. So it's something you have to adapt. And with Rafa playing the huge topspin in which the ball bounce very high, it's very tough on the one hand backhand to play over the shoulder. So it was always a challenge for Roger. I think Nadal was probably the first one to ask him questions that he was unable to answer. Nadal owns this place and he's such a tough competitor. Roger, for a few years he didn't have anyone really contesting him and he won so easily. For like three years, I mean, he was just no-- no disrespect to Philippoussis and Roddick but they weren't, you know, Nadal. And so I felt like he's-- he's been challenged here. I think Nadal was necessary. People saying Federer is unbeatable, he's got no weaknesses. And then Nadal came along with this very particular game. In-- in some larger sense you can only say that the gods of tennis sat around and thought the game is becoming unbalanced and, in a sense, he was put on earth purely for the purpose of defeating Federer. He's a fighter and he's a grinder and he deserves it to win here I think. - Well, you deserve to win too, Roger. -Thank you. We'll see at Wimbledon. New ball, three. These two, it's a fantastic rivalry and-- and we sit here watching today's match and-- and I don't think anyone really knows which way it's going to go. We are living our match, you know, obviously the-- the players making history, not the officials. We-- we're part of the-- of the game, we're part of the match, but we are, there is two plus one. Real atmosphere bubbling up in here. Game Nadal. Game Nadal. Yeah, it's pepped enough. And Nadal is very much back in this set. I think I'm the kind of person that always gives it my all. Competition is about winning. What have you got to do to win a point against Rafael Nadal? Rafa is the greatest fighter I've ever seen on the tennis court. And I played Connors thirty times. I know what it's like to play guys that seem like every point is the last point they're ever going to play and that's-- it's inspiring but it's-- it's-- it's also intimidating. Disappointment for the Federer camp. Advantage Nadal. Amazement from the crowd. Ladies and gentlemen, as a courtesy to the players, remind to be quiet during the balls. Game Nadal. He has forced his way back into this set and will serve for a two-set lead. Nadal leads five game to four. Second set. Is the great man running out of ideas? He's certainly got to make something happen pretty soon. He's certainly running out of time, it would appear. And it's set point for a two set lead to the Spaniard. Two sets it is to Rafael Nadal, the five-time defending champion. Well, he's got a mountain to climb now. Nadal leads by two sets to oh. The first two sets when I look back at that finals, you know, it's like I played them but maybe I was a bit-- how do you-- how do you say it? I'm not sure if I really believed that I was going to win the match. My problem was that I had lost in the French Open finals a month earlier against Rafa in a terrible way. Rafael, I think he had a great year in clay courts so we went to Roland Garros, and I believe Rafael played his best tournament. Rafael Nadal had been trying to reel in Roger Federer for years. This guy just plays so hard every point. And then finally he absolutely thrashed Federer in a way that he'd never done before. A rare vision. Roger Federer without that confidence, without the champion's body language. That was destructive tennis. Federer looked like an old man that day. Right now he's embarrassed to be out there. He just doesn't know what to do. Game, set and match, Nadal. 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 I think he was affected by this loss in-- in Paris. You maybe try to forget or you try to put it in the-- in the background that you lost that badly. I wish it was a different outcome. I wish I could have-- Look, it doesn't matter to-- now what happened, you know, I mean the match is over, clay court season is over. If you see Nadal the way he plays, it was like I remember first seeing him, I'm like this guy's going to be one of the greatest clay court players at-- of all time, that's a given. But I don't know if that's going to translate on grass. 2006 and then 2007 Rafa was knocking on the door. And it was a time where he was the king of clay, I was the king of grass. All of the tennis world would be watching. Wimbledon is a very special tournament, Personally, I always dreamt of playing on grass, because it's pretty much the only tournament where that can be done. Federer has never been challenged like this in a Wimbledon final. He's never gone the distance, he's never gone to five sets, he's never been two sets to one down. That-- that point you say, okay, no, no, Rafa can maybe win Wimbledon and he's going to be in-- in Rogers' head. Second championship point. It's five in a row. Fantastic. It was 2007. I felt bad in the sense that... I wasn't able to overcome the adversities in such an important moment. That hurt. Is there a way back in for Federer? There's no doubt. He has the ability, but right now down two sets. Does even he have the belief, and that's what we're going to have to find out. It's going to be very hard for him to turn it around right now. What if Nadal beats him on grass? Well, if he beats him on grass everything changes. Everything. The-- the landscape would shift completely. 30-40. I think Roger was feeling that Rafa was getting better on the grass. Every year he got a little closer. It was before that I think Roger was feeling that he can play just average tennis and he'll still win. But as Rafa was getting better and better he knew he had to raise his level and he-- I think he was feeling the pressure that way. Oh, he's got him again. I remember the clouds started to darken, the wind picked up and it was like Federer's mood was actually changing as the weather changed. His mood was probably darkening. So disgusted with himself Nadal still resists. It's amazing as well when you sort of see the way how this match has unfolded and you just sort of feel like-- Today's the day for Nadal. Today'sthe day. As the match evolved, you sort of sensed something special was happening because Nadal was winning. Federer was the favorite. He'd been the king of Wimbledon and won plenty of times already. But Nadal hadn't. And it looked like this was going to be his opportunity. So that created an enormous amount of excitement. But you just felt it was never going to be plain sailing, you knew that Federer was going to have an opportunity at some stage. The players are going off. Line judges off, everybody off. The umpire will stay up there probably and be pushed off the court. There he goes, bye-bye. You always think when a break is taken that it favors the man who's losing. Federer certainly is losing at the moment. This championship, well, it's hanging by a thread. I try to go back to the locker room as quick as I could because you don't know how long the rain delay is actually going to take. People sometimes cannot believe that all the players are in the same locker room. It's a very important moment because there you can resettle again, you can talk to your team, you can calm down again a little bit if you're panicking. We saw Mirka quickly outside of the locker room, which is very important, you know. She's also very positive, always believes that Roger can win and-- and that helps him a lot. I think the emotional part about me about playing really could be because I seeked perfection maybe way too early in my life. I thought I could play these perfect tennis shots backhand, forehands, drop shots, you name it, smashes. And I think I probably thought I could hit shots I saw on TV. The players I used to admire, Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, Pete Sampras. They were the Wimbledon champions at the time. They were maybe the number one in the world. So I think that inspired me to play the way I played then. Very often I would come in and go like, okay, confident, happy and everything and then and I'd be like, bang, hitting a wall and realizing, well, it's not possible yet, you're not strong enough, you're not big enough yet. I don't know, you don't get it yet. Roger always had a certain expectation of the standard he wanted to play. When it didn't go his way, that's-- that's actually the point when he got so annoyed. So you can imagine my parents didn't enjoy it when I was behaving like a brat on the court, throwing rackets and shouting and screaming and crying and playing again and fighting. And it was just too emotional. It was just too crazy for them. So they would be very disappointed in my behavior. We sometimes, we felt really ashamed and we really took him many times aside and said, Roger, I mean, I'm not going along with you anymore, I'm not playing the fool next to the court while you perform like this. I used to tell him, you know, your bad behavior is like sending an invitation to your opponent and saying, here I am, beat me, I'm really to beat today. So, go ahead. And I liked to also get rid of my frustration. And I thought also it might have helped that John McEnroe or Goran Ivanisevic to play better in the process. Coaches told me it's not good for me that in the process I won't be playing better, I will be-- usually be playing worse because it's a negative energy that comes through. You could see he had talent but the coaches had to push him quite a bit a lot of time and he was-- he was testing the limits. Yes, so he was very young. He was the youngest of all the players we had at the time. There were still a lot of moments where he had difficulties concentrating. He had so much in him already, but he could not express everything yet. He quickly realized that working on his physical fitness, would help him to do what he enjoys most, playing. And to express even better what he can do so well, which is being creative. It made me understand my overall game, I have to come to the net, I have to try to finish, I have to try to take chances. And then as we evolve and you become stronger, I would get to balls I didn't know I could get to and then with my talent and my hand-eye coordination and my technique, I was able to pull off shots I never thought I could. And I feel like that connected everything. And I think this is when it got really a lot of fun for me. When Roger Federer was sixteen, people were already talking about him. Game, set and match, Federer. Two sets for love, 6-4, 6-4. He won Wimbledon poise and then turned pro the next day in Switzerland. In Switzerland we don't expect people to win big tournaments. So, at the time, especially not. We like to be precise, I generalize here, to the max, and you're supposed to be humble. So it's kind of interesting also when he came along and he basically said, you know, I want to win-- win big tournaments. And he wasn't really humble about it. And one of the first big matches he played was in Basel against Andre Agassi. And, you know, he went out there to win, which was almost like what is he trying to do, you're playing against Andre Agassi and you are a junior, you know, you're supposed to lose here. But he wasn't acting that way. But then the losing hurt, you know, it just really did. I didn't like losing. The number of times we would go to tournaments and he would throw in a substandard performance or he'd mentally break down and he'd get emotional, he'd throw his rackets. He was losing matches he should have won. I was too far ahead of myself. I don't want to say cocky but I think I probably thought I was better than I maybe was sometimes, that I could hit shots I saw on TV. He was all flourishes and beautiful trick shots but there was no identity to his game. Roger was getting very angry on the tennis court, he was breaking racket or whatever when he was young. But he was always respecting the opponent. It was always against himself. He was never being provocative. He was never being unfair. He was never cheating. He went through times when he was very, very hard on himself. He is very, very self-critical. It's difficult for an artist when he has a desire to express himself, and he knows how to express himself, but he can't actually express himself the way he wants to. And that's why at the beginning of his career, it may have taken a while, because there were so many things to put together in the puzzle. I'm telling you, people were rolling their eyes when I kept bringing him up in conversation. When I reached the stage of my career where I'm touring professional and I just thought, well, honestly, I feel uncomfortable doing this in front of ten thousand people, I don't like to do it when there's live TV watching, and I don't know how many thousands or millions are watching, you know, in their living room, me playing, throwing rackets and shouting and what is the commentary saying about me, I didn't like that. And I said, "I'll change from here on." I think each generation has their guy. Borg certainly was the player of his generation. Lendl. I was probably the player of my generation in the '90s. I felt like I was going to win that match. I just felt pretty confident. He was pretty young at the time but Roger was very tough. Oh, that's a great shot. I was caught off guard. He was serving huge, he was moving great, he was returning my serve with ease and just felt a little bit overpowered. Thank you . He's done it! The champion is out! It's tough out there. He definitely is... He's got a great future. I mean, he's already proven that he's a great player and that he's got a good chance to maybe go all the way. A new bat in tennis' past to a new generation. Federer can hardly believe it, the emotion at the moment of having beaten the greatest grass court player of all time is too much for him. Nineteen years of age and his first ever appearance on the Centre Court of Wimbledon. He has played a magnificent match to defeat the seven times champion in five extraordinary sets. You have to find your own identity and do it your way. Only I believe when Wimbledon rolled around in 2003, I felt like I grew into my own. I felt comfortable with the fighting spirit, the positive and negative energy, how to absorb and how to utilize it in the best possible way. Everything comes into play. So, there's just a lot of decision-making, a lot of mistakes you can do along the way, but one thing you can't is you can't do it perfect every single time. So you have to learn to play with problems and you have to learn how to play with pain. One therefore has to find this harmony. That's why it's crucial for Roger, that the man he is, embodies the player he is. That those two are one and the same thing. Everyone knew that Nadal was a great fighter. But with Federer, you know, he's naturally a front-runner. On grass especially he'd always for the last few years had completely dominated. He'd never had to come back from behind in that way. And so everyone knew that Nadal would fight to the end. But one wasn't quite sure how Federer would react to adversity. Hello. This has turned around. He loves to win. He's Mr. Nice Guy but he wants to beat you when he's on the court. He wants to find the solution to how to win. Game Federer. I believe that the rain delay probably woke me up and I said, well, if we're going to go out of this match, well, at least you're going to go down swinging and really start to wake up. You know if it does go to a tie break, it will be the last roll of the dice for Federer to see whether he can stay in the match. Game Nadal. Six, game two, six. Tie break. Neither player has lost a tie breaker in this championship so far. Federer's 103, he's played Nadal's 104, he's played. Something has to give. You have to find a certain intensity, I believe, that helps you through these moments. That's part of showing your opponent that you're really interested to win. Well, there's no mistaking what the crowd wants and it's no disrespect to Nadal. But I think they quite fancy some more tennis. Thank you. Federer certainly wanted to play more tennis and he still believed that he could turn it around. And it was amazing how he was able to-- to hang in there and-- and maintain the belief against the guy that we all know has caused him a lot of problems. This was someone trying to take away his crown in his own backyard. So, two sets to love down, you know, the way Federer dug in was-- was impressive. Federer's serve is much better than mine. He has won many games with his serve, in under a minute and a few seconds. That doesn't happen to me... so I need other virtues that he doesn't have. 6-5, Federer. Federer. Federer game 2-6. Well, that wasn't so much of a cheer as an eruption. We reached the tie break of the third set, Rafael lost. Always, when we started, I used to say to Rafael... "Good face." When he started to train I always used to say, “Good face." Why? Because it's impossible to learn, to improve or do anything right when you don't have a good attitude. When he has had situations against other tennis players, that have overwhelmed him, well he has almost always been able to turn things to his side. And I think doubt or the uncertainty of not being the best... makes you try to do it better in some way. I've never considered myself good enough to just go and train, and just train. I've always gone training with the desire of improving. I believe he has no reason not to be humble... he has no reason to feel special. He's special when he plays tennis in New York or in Wimbledon, where there are 20,000 people in the finals. I don't think it is possible to stop being humble because you perfectly hit a tennis ball. I don't see the world as Rafa Nadal, the tennis player or tennis star. I see the world as a normal person. My life here is completely normal, like any of my friends. The feeling of belonging to Mallorca, an island, a place where you always feel comfortable and where you always want to go back because you think it is the place... that gives you the energy to continue with your professional career. I think for Rafael this is the place where he feels the tranquility that he can't feel in any other place. When he comes here, he feels supported by his friends, he feels the way he did as a kid. So Rafa, even though he's been traveling since he was young, he has always wanted to come back. I believe he has never imagined himself living anywhere but Mallorca. Here I can see my friends and my family every day and that makes my relationship with my family one of the most important things in my life. He finds his own way to feel comfortable at Wimbledon or Australian Open or French Open, whatever it is, he creates a home, you know, where it's not his own. He doesn't try to recreate what he's got in Mallorca, that's impossible, but he creates his own environment. You know, he rents a place and he's got his family there with him. You can spend some time with your family if they come over and you can have a positive and peaceful atmosphere. Sometimes I cook, sometimes someone else does. I like cooking, I have no issues with that. Everything is programmed in order to try to be as relaxed as possible and try to be as focused and concentrated as possible. I can imagine that Nadal, who is a great tennis fighter, has always looked for the challenge of solving problems. And I think that with Roger, it's the same thing. Maybe they each have their philosophy about how to solve the problem. Roger always needs to feel something positive, he always needs to feel the opening up of a possibility, a path, a solution. Pierre is definitely part of my mental game even though I don't feel like I do any mental work to-- for tennis. But our-- let's say if we catch up together and we-- we're working out, probably thirty percent of it is talking, you know, about possibilities, what could we change, what could we do, what else can we improve. "How's life at home, Roger?" And I'm like, I'll talk to him about it, you know. So I'm very open and honest. I think Pierre knows a lot about me more than most people in my life. He's always been himself and I think that this has been his great mental labor his entire life. I noticed that already when he was young, He always tried to find a balance between what he does and who he is. His attention to detail into his training, his-- his practice, his injury prevention, his schedule and-- and his matches is incredible. And I think sometimes he doesn't get the almost the credit he deserves because he makes it look so easy. He's a good phy-- physique that doesn't put too much stress on his joints. He's a great mover. He's well balanced. So people think, well, that's it's just natural, it's a God-given talent and he does have enormous talent but he works just as hard as anyone else at-- at improving all those attributes. If family and wife's not happy, then my tennis is going to wobble, you know. And then if this doesn't work out, the fitness is not right, then everything-- it's like a Jenga block building, you know, and everything needs to fall into place. My wife, who I met back in 2000 at the Olympics, I mean she-- she's been a rock, you know, in my life, you know. She's been there, gave me consistency. Is the guy-- is the guy you are with, is he very nice? Yeah, he's very nice. I think most important is that you're authentic that you're yourself and that's what Roger is. Off the court I think it's very important but also on the court, you know. If you try to show things that are not really inside of you, then it-- it doesn't work, the whole puzzle doesn't work. Roger looks for the perfect game. He seeks harmony. He seeks creativity. But we must not forget that Roger is also ready to fight. Roger is an artist who knows how to fight, whereas Nadal is a fighter who knows how to be an artist as well. It's similar to ballet. We don't see the effort, but we know that these people work very hard... to express grace, to express harmony. I think that controlling time is what leads you to success. The greatest sportsmen of history, have the mental capacity to think faster, see faster and make important decisions faster than others. Fantastic point. Game Federer. Six against oh, fourth set, tie break. He didn't really think that he was going to give this championship away after five years as the boss. Both players will receive one additional challenge. Rafa! Roger! Thank you. Thank you. Quiet, please. 2-1, Nadal. Nadal takes back the advantage. As confident as we are, and we need to have that confidence, we also need to know the other side that it's always dangerous. Nadal is closing in on this Wimbledon men's singles title. You learn so much from the sport from winning, from losing, trying to figure out and just being uncomfortable and trying to fight through those-- those difficult moments. That's wide. That could be the crucial blow. Uncle Toni can't even watch anymore. Five-two, Nadal. He's coached this young man, his nephew, since he was four years old. I remember that... Rafael was up 5 to 2 with two serves, the match was almost won. And he is two points away from the championship and he will serve the next two points. At that moment I started to feel nervous. When he missed his first serve, I told Carlos Costa who was sitting next to me, I said, "Double fault." I didn't want to look. Once I missed my first serve, I had a feeling I might double fault. Fault! Five-three, Nadal. Federer is a champion. He has that mentality in him and started to see Nadal at the other end just shaken a little and a little scared. And Federer jumped on that. Set point or match point from here on in. 6-5, Federer. Oh, he waited for it! 8-7, Nadal. And that means championship point. When I was serving to win Wimbledon, I thought... “I'm gonna win Wimbledon”. I remember to be on the chair and do like phew! Oh my goodness! For Roger to hit a shot at that moment with that incredible pace off the backhand was jaw-dropping. That was the worst feeling I’ve had on a tennis court. I never think “I'm going to win.” Instead, I just focus on the next point. But that match was so important, I felt that the ball was there and I'd win. The two best passing shots of the tournament without doubt have just taken place on the last two points. It's eight all. What's next? Two championship points gone for Nadal. Sheer quality from both players. Roger pulled out the fourth set tie breaker and had saved a few match points because that seemed like it took it to this whole new level. Haven't seen a tie break like that since Borg-McEnroe 1980. It was up there. We really do have the classic confrontation here, the best server McEnroe against the best returner, and the most volatile player in the world against the calmest. On the court it was something special to see John's face. You knew that this is going to be a hell of a fight, this is going to be a hell of a match. And you have to hand it to both men. There hasn't been an inch given by either of them. They've both looked down the gun barrel and they're both still alive. I always get a hundred, and I wanted to win. That's it! That was the most memorable match in my career. And to win for the fifth time in a row, to beat John in the final, was something special. Borg and McEnroe is something that people are still talking about nearly forty years on. And-- and that will continue. So the number two player in the word just watching and seeing, waiting for the day when perhaps he'll have this chance to do that. I've spent the last twenty-five years of my life trying to figure out a way to remember the wins instead of dwelling on my losses. It goes for both Chris and I. We would have both won a whole bunch more if the other one wasn't around but we wouldn't have been as good a tennis player. At the end of the tournament we were the only ones in the locker room on Sunday. One of us was a winner and one of us was a loser. One of us would always be comforting the other one. I saw her in her most vulnerable moments. I think that Martina and I got to a point where it was like, you know, okay, the match is over, this is all about human compassion now. You embrace the fact that maybe this rivalry is bigger than you and you're a part of something wonderful. They share something, these players, I see it's when they retire, having spent time on the Champions Tour you see that that they're-- they're often happiest in each other's company. Certainly Borg and McEnroe Are. Game set match! He's won it! He's won it! When I did win it, I felt like I could fly for that couple of seconds or a minute when it happened because I felt like I finally earned it. But, at the same time, soon afterwards my greatest rival quit. '81 was my last year. I just lost my motivation for tennis. And then the worst thing came that I didn't care if I was winning or losing. And that's not me. He was retiring. He told us a few months after the Open when I played him in the '81 Open, he said I'm retire-- we thought he was kidding, we laughed. It felt like tennis was bigger than ever and we were on the cover of Sports Illustrated and people were talking about it and we were-- it was happening, you know, and I was like, "What are you doing?" I mean this is crazy. I couldn't believe that he was even thinking about it. I think it's too bad for the game and it's too bad for me because my best tennis has been against him but-- I did over the course of the next couple of years tried to talk him into coming back, or I wanted him to come back or when are you coming back. I would have been happy for him to come back and lose my number one ranking because I think he was that important to the game. And he was that important to me. And now, for the second year in a row, a five-set final between the two best players in the world. The way that mach unfolded, I remember the producer saying to me, "What can you see? What can you tell us from the statistics as we head into this fifth set that will determine the Wimbledon champion?" And I remember thinking stats right now just feel utterly irrelevant. Oh! These guys were doing their thing at a level we hadn't seen before. I think I felt like I owe it to the players, not to sort of be a loud-mouth and sort of say, "Oh, this is what they should do now in the fifth." That's a bunch of baloney. That's it. This is emotional, this is like heart and will. Game Federer. Now for the first time in three hours and thirty-seven minutes Roger is in the lead. It's something where you have to say, let's just watch this and enjoy something because this doesn't come along very often. Game Federer. That's the first time we've seen Rafa Nadal shake his head this entire tournament and why not, two match points and the fourth set tie breaker. Ah, it's brilliantly played! Two spots of rain here on Centre Court, I'm afraid. Getting a little heavier. The play is stopping and that is too bad. Three hours and fifty-six minutes, a first-class drama on Centre Court. The match was stopped at 2-2 in the fifth set, I thought the match was lost. That Federer had a better chance of victory. Rafa had lost twice before to Federer. He had had a chance to win, and it had vanished in front of him. I went to the locker room, because I thought I was going to find Rafael with very... very low hopes. I thought, "What can I tell Rafael to motivate him, to raise his spirits?" I don't know what Toni meant to tell me at the moment, but... I was prepared to take on the challenge and deal with adversity at every moment. And that's what I told Toni, that I wouldn't fail. Federer could win, but I wasn't going to lose. If he wins, so be it, but I won't lose. And those clouds are clearing off, those ones on the right. We are so very different in how we approach things. Yet, if you scratch only the surface, you realize that we're probably quite similar. Constantly thinking, thinking, thinking what could be my next play, it's like a chess game, you know, like there's always a next move. Wondrous forehand! Game Federer. Federer leads six games to five. Final set. I do admire Federer's style and those who don't either they don't know about tennis... even if you're someone else's fan, you need to be able to recognize excellence and Federer is excellent in every sense. Game Nadal. Six games all. Final set. There is no tie break in the fifth, a deciding set at Wimbledon. So we go on. It has to be two-game advantage. Game Federer. And Nadal will come out to serve again to stay in the match. Seven games all. Final set. Imagine being two sets to love up against a guy you've never beaten in the Wimbledon final before and then he starts to come back at you and he's starting to show everybody how he's won all of these Wimbledon titles. How Nadal held it together after that, I don't think I'll ever know. Advantage Nadal. Here is another breakpoint, the fourth of the game. Game Nadal. Nadal leads by eight games to seven, final set. The tennis was-- was incredibly good. The only concern is maybe the darkness. The court was almost being lit by flashbulbs at the end. It was painfully dark. Stopping a match for darkness is up to the referee. But because they are not reacting to it, okay let's keep playing until a point where it's-- it's getting too dark. There's been occasions where major events such as Wimbledon have gone on to the next day. This had just been too good to say, "Wait a second, we're going to stop and come back and play, perhaps, one game the next day." Let's try to finish it. Let's-- let's try to have a winner tonight. The five-time defending champion is at the mercy of Rafael Nadal here. Ah! Well, no wonder people stand. Three match points Nadal has had, three times he's been on the break and three times Federer has said no. Advantage Nadal. There is a new man at the head of men's tennis, Rafael Nadal. Six-seven. Nine-seven. Runner-up, Roger Federer! And the Wimbledon gentlemen's singles champion for 2008, Rafael Nadal! And the fact that you beat Roger here on Centre Court in arguably one of the greatest finals we have ever seen, does that make this even more special? Well... For sure. You know, when Roger, he after five years-- I lost the last two finals, close finals, but he is still the number one. He's still the best. He's still five-time champions here. And right now I have one. So, for me it's very, very, very important. And now having shared this contest together, they now share the limelight and rightly so. There's two champions there. No six in a row for Roger Federer, but the first French Open, Wimbledon Doubles since Bjorn Borg. We'll be talking about that match for decades. I think I'm going to say another fifty years of matches. And I'd be surprised if it's better. First of all, can I just say thank you as a tennis player that you allowed us to be part of this amazing spectacle. I mean is that-- is that any consolation? A little bit. Thanks, John. It's tough, it's tough, it hurts. In the moment itself, you know, I was like, "Oh my God, this is the worst day of my life." It was really-- was like a maybe three, four, five, six, seven weeks after the match that I really started to feel the magnitude of the match. These two haven't played each other since Wimbledon, so this is a treat for us and I'm loving it. Compared to the way things were for years, history was now being rewritten. Nadal has done it! I had to embrace the idea of a rival. In the beginning I didn't want to have one. Maybe I'll try later again, I don't know. God, it's killing me. And then, eventually, I realized there's something good to take out of these situations. So I maybe have to adjust my game a little bit. I don't like to do that per se, but why not? Let's go. This one title that he has not yet won, he's the guy who's got to prove himself. As much as you just only want to win, you also want to become the best player you can be in-- in your lifetime. I can't help but think that from the island of Mallorca right now, Rafael Nadal feels good for Roger. Rafael Nadal! The circuit evolves, the players evolve, If you want to keep the same position, you have to improve and evolve from the player you were 8 or 10 years ago. Federer's fifteenth Grand Slam championship. That breaks the tie with Pete Sampras. I don't know if Roger would still be around if Rafael hadn't been born. It's hard to stay motivated, and they kind of pulled each other. They are always forced to reach their limit, to go a bit further, but it's not about becoming better just to win, but becoming better as a matter of life. What makes it stand out from any other rivalry, they're both exceptional people. They both have such a respect for each other. They both are very humble. One can win... or one can lose. This year's runner-up, Roger Federer. Nadal is the king of Rolad Garros. That's part of our lives. We need to know how to live with both, defeat and victory. These two guys at their age with all that they've accomplished, with a chance to play each other again. Especially as you get older, you start to feel like how many more opportunities am I going to have to do this. Ladies and gentlemen, the 2017 champion of the Australian Open, Roger Federer. Thank you, guys. You stand there on the podium, there's a standing ovation going on, everybody's listening, you could hear a pin drop. I don't think we both either one of us believed that we're going to be in the finals of Australia when we saw each other. And here we stand in the finals. I remember also how I felt in 2008 and he must have felt the same in 2017. What-- what can you say? You know. Tennis is a-- tennis is a tough sport. There's no-- no draws. But if there was going to be one, I would be very happy to accept the draw tonight and share it with Rafa really. I learned a lot from those matches and you-- you feel like almost you-- you grow up, you know, and you have more experience in life because of these matches. You start respecting each other more and more because in those moments it's so personal, it's so intense. I mean, there's no question that these two guys made each other better players. The quality is better than it's ever been. What a treat. What a treat to have two of the greatest of all time playing at the same time, you know, it's just-- we're so lucky.
