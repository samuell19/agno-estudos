- So what do you do? - Teach psychology at the college, and see my girls on the weekends. I'm on probation right now. That's why I got tea. - What for? - Heroin. Hurt my back in school, playing baseball, got put on hydrocodone. I liked it a little too much. Eventually doctor took me off of them, so I went to the street and hydros turned into oxys and roxy's, and then I found heroin. Sorry, I'm talking too much. I just wanna be up front with you. - It's okay. Your girls, what are their names? Kathryn and Missy. They deserve a lot more than I can give. What do you mean? I stopped going to school plays, tee ball games. Didn't help my wife when she needed it. Anytime she'd bring it up, I'd just argue with her and go out and find more. Until one day she had enough she packed up the car and took the kids while I was out. When I got home, I found a note she left saying she couldn't do it anymore. I don't blame her. I was a fool. That night I went out. I bought as much heroin as I could get my hands on. Tonya called one of our neighbors to come check on me, and if she hadn't, I would have died that night. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to- - No, that's all right. I got a lot of making up to- God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things that I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Okay, let's start over here. I'm Byron. Hi Byron. - I'm Samantha and I'm an addict. - Hi, Samantha. I'm Glenn and I'm an addict. - Hi, Glenn. - I'm Jacob, and I'm an addict. - Hi, Jacob. - I'm Tina, and I'm an addict. - Hi, Tina. - I'm Missy, and I'm an addict. - Hi, Missy. - I'm Jeremy, and I'm an addict. - Hi, Jeremy. - I'm Eddy.

I'm an addict. - Hi, Duncan. Thanks for coming. - Wasn't my decision, so. - Who would like to share first? - I'm Samantha, I'm an addict. - Hi, Samantha. - I slipped. I had just gotten out of rehab, again. There was a death in my family, my nephew. Sorry. He was really young. It was an accident. My sister wasn't there for me, or she couldn't be there for me. So I went to see my guy. I bought and used, and when I woke up, my nephew was still dead. Step one, right? I admit. I'm powerless, you guys, but I gotta make amends. To my husband and my kids, I want peace with my kids. Okay, see you Hey, Duncan. Hey, man, thanks for coming. - Yeah, I'll be back soon. - Well, that's great to hear. Hey, listen, do you have a sponsor yet? - Sponsor? No. - Byron, I think Byron would be good for you. Hey, Byron. - He's a sponsor? - Byron's been a long time. He's last isn't with us anymore. Byron, Duncan, Duncan. Duncan, Byron. - Hey. - Hey, see you guys next time. - For sure. Your looking for a sponsor? - I guess. All right, cool. You wanna have a seat, we can chat. - Why not? - Let's go. Let's have a seat. You're new to Dallas? - No, I just moved back. - Really, where from? - Houston. What about you? - I'm from Dallas, man, born and raised. Tell me about yourself. - Separated, two girls. - Really? How old are the girls? - Seven and five. - Full of energy. - What about you though. You have a family or a job here? - Work construction until the mid 30s, and went in for surgery and it was just never really the same. I aint got no family, but the people you see here. Why didn't you volunteer to speak today? Look, man, everyone that comes in here thinks they're a one man army. Just follow the steps. Step one is simply just to admit that you're- - I've done this, man. I don't need to do it again. It doesn't help. I've wasted my time and yours. - You know what? It's all right, if you don't want me to be your sponsor. Sometimes people want a sponsor very similar to themselves, but sometimes, sometimes someone who's very different is exactly what they need. Here, that's my number. Put it on your phone. If you need someone to talk to, I'll listen. - That's my favorite color. - It's so cute. - Hey. - You've got 10 minutes. And Jared's here. - Hey, guys. - Daddy. - I missed you. You're so big now. I missed you too, Kathryn. - Kathryn- - What are you doing, coloring? - Yeah. - Hey. - Can I color too? - Yeah. - All right.

Breakfast is ready. - Here, let's get some sausage on your plate. - Aye, aye, sir. - Where do you learn that stuff? - That's the school play. - You know the one about the mermaid. - So you're a little mermaid. - No, I mean the first mate. - Well, every captain needs the first mate. I think I'm gonna start on that list now. - Okay, here you go. - Candles, his one. - Just, please. - As you wish, El Capitan. Hey, do you want anything special from the store? Some ice cream maybe? - Yeah, chocolate. - Aye, aye. I'll be back. - Grandma. - How are you? - Hey, I'm great. - Run to the kitchen. We'll open it together. - Hi. - Hey. - Hey, dad. - Hey sweetheart. - You know I wasn't, I wasn't expecting you guys for a few more hours. - Well, you know how your mom is. How are you doing? - Good, doing good. - Stephen here? - I sent him out to run a few errands before the party. Duncan said he was coming too. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Will he? - Yes, he will. He promised. He promised, yeah. He'll be here. - All right. Who's ready for some cake? a cake. - Bless you. - What I wouldn't do. - How do you know what I want anymore. - How do you mean, man, you're a free agent. Let's go buy a beer. - I quit drinking. - Right. Sorry to hear about the wife and kids, man. That's a rough business, but didn't put anything else, right? - What are you doing. - Relax princess. Nobody cares. Come on, you got the cash, right? Hey, you called me down here. You're buying something. Last chance. You got anything mild? - Muscle relaxers. - Yeah, that's great. So two months ago, you lived here. - Yes. I love it. - I'm sorry. - Hi. Hi. Duncan, you smell like a bar. - You okay, you look exhausted. He's not helping with the kids is he? - Duncan, look, I appreciate it. But honestly, you're the last person that I should be taking parenting or marriage advice from, so thanks. How are your meetings going? - They're fine. - Yeah? Yeah. - Don't make me roll up your sleeve. - You think you could? - Definitely. - Try me. - Okay, I got it. See I'm stronger than you. - Look who decided to finally show up. - Hey, there stranger. - Hey. You two look good. - So do you. - How's the girls? - They're good, mom. - You think you could bring them by next weekend? - They're gonna be with their mother next weekend, so I can't really- - Did they tell you that they're going on another trip? - Yeah, it's not a biggie. We're just going to meet with a distributor. - Which one? - The one that- - Duncan. It's been ages. Hey, there buddy. Hey, Jess, Stephen, I'll be right back - Dad, how the restaurant supply business? - It's good. It's real good. - Grandpa, I'm a pirate. - You sure are. - Lily, don't be shy. You know your uncle Duncan. - Gosh, you got so big. How old are you now 12, 13? - No, I'm eight. - Eight. - Are you getting ready for Halloween? - No, I'm in a play. - In a play. Can I come see it? - Sure, you wanna see my sword? - Of course. Show me. - Whoa, that looks sharp. On guard you scallywag. - Hey guys. - Hi buddy. - I think that's enough. - Thank you. Sorry. She is the first mate in her school play. That's just the way things go now. - It's good to be here. I'm glad I came. - Me too. - I'm gonna make myself some tea. Why don't you go entertain. - Okay, enjoy yourself. - Dude, it's about time you got here. What are you looking for? - Tea. - Why don't you have a beer. - No, thanks. - Come on man. It's a party. Everybody knows you love to party. - I wouldn't wanna make a fool of myself at a kid's birthday party. - Yeah, well, says the guy who just got out of prison. - Okay. How about you go give that to your father-in-law. What is wrong with you? - If you don't do something about him I will. I'm sorry, Jessy. I just wanna be here for you. Meetings are still going well, work's good. Life's going good. - It's just, it's been hard. You know it's been hard. - I know. I know it is. Before I forget, call this number. - Wait what? - Come on. She's a good friend. Just give her a call. - Jessie. Excuse me. I'm sorry. We still need to be taken to the airport pretty soon. Steven is entertaining, if you know what I mean? - He's drunk. Look, there's no trouble at all. We can just call a cab, really. - No, I mean Duncan can take you. - Well, that's- - Yeah, I don't mind. - Really, there's no trouble. - No. He's not doing anything. - Yeah. I can take them. - Well, that's great. We'll leave in about an hour. - Thank you, Duncan. Sorry - Hey, thanks for letting us stop. We're just gonna pick up a couple of things for the girls and then we'll hit the road. - You don't have to do that. - How about something like this? - Really you don't have to. - Dan, we miss the girls and we wanna get them something from you. - Well, they don't need anything. - Girls always need more clothes. - Well, Missy has Kathryn hand me downs, but Tonya did say that Kathryn needs- - Mom, why are you talking to Tonya? - Is it such a bad thing that I'm talking to my grandchildren's mother? - Yeah, it is. When you try to hide it from me. - Okay, and I also know that you haven't returned the divorce papers that she had drafted. - Martha. - Honey, it's been months. I mean, are you embarrassed about it? Do you need to talk about it? - That's not it, mom. - Well, whether it is or not, Tonya's not happy. - Son, there's nothing to be embarrassed about. Lord knows your mom and I had our troubles in the passed. - Ron. - No, that's the truth. You're gonna have to make a decision. You're gonna have to be the man, step up and do the right thing. Whatever the right thing is. I'm sorry, we're talking about this here. We hadn't had much of a chance to talk. - Dad, what about this? Missy loves dolphins. - Yeah, she does. - Hey, baby. - Daddy. Daisy or Kathryn, party. - Daddy. - This is for you guys, here. - What are you doing? - Girls, take those inside and then we'll open them, all right? - Okay. - Okay. I missed girls' birthday party. - Duncan, you can't keep doing this. - Doing what? - Popping in here like everything's fine. - Look, I'm trying. I'm on track now, Tonya. I'm trying. - I don't care if you win the lottery, Duncan. This isn't fine. - Come on, dad. - I'm coming. - Duncan, you can't keep flipping them on and off like a light switch. - Look, I messed up. I get it. I understand. I'm sorry, - Sorry doesn't cut it, Duncan. You lost that when you left the girls, and when you tore apart this family. You can still see them on the weekends like we agreed. Just call first. All right, girls, daddy's gotta leave. You're gonna open the presents quickly, okay? - Okay. - You guys are ready to open presents? - Yeah. - Yeah. - It's a dolphin. Thank you, daddy. - You're welcome. - I love it too much. I'll sleep with it, and bring it everywhere. - Yeah, what are you gonna name him. - Rose field. - Rose field? - Yes, we can. - Yeah, it was cute. - What does it say? - Sweet dreams. - I didn't know daddy was coming for a visit. - I know. - All right, girls, it's way past your bedtime. You can play with your new things tomorrow. I know. It's bedtime now. Goodnight. - Goodnight, mom. Love you. - Love you. Jared, I didn't know he was coming. It was nothing, okay? - I saw the way you looked at him, Tonya. Look, you promised me before that you'd never take him back. - I'm not. - I wanna be there for you and the girls. I do, but you gotta want it too. - Jared, come on. - Good afternoon. My name is Professor Cook, and I'll be your lecture for the next 13 weeks. Syllabus for the next semester can be found online. What is psychology? - The study of the mind. - Yes. - The study of why we do what we do. - Why we do what we do. Yes. Behavior, take an addict for example. Now we, you and I, we know what's bad for us right but sometimes we keep going back to these things. Alcohol, fast food, gambling, drugs. Why? - Because it feels good. - Why does it feel good? - I don't know. It just does. - How can we determine the why behind decisions you make, and why we make those decisions? Read chapter one by Wednesday. In the meantime, we'll go over the introduction on page four. - It was a fine lecture. I've been assigned to audit your classes this semester. - How many? - All of them. - Well, I look forward to having you. You're the best fire it up there. What's for dinner, I'm buying. - Pizza. - Pizza it is. - Pizza, again. Show me your hands. - Let's go get some gumballs. - Wow. I don't know who's the bigger handful at this point. - I wish Steven could have made it. - Yeah, I know. He's on a really big project at work right now. I bought the DVD. We'll just watch it later. I did wanna get your thoughts on me going back to grad school. - I think it's a great idea. I mean, once the kids get older. - I wasn't going to wait that long. I was thinking I would enroll this next semester. - What about the kids? I mean- - Daycare can get really expensive. - Well, I wouldn't have to worry about daycare. All the classes are online now, so I'd be able to do my work while Lilly is at school and while Garret's napping. Okay, what does Steven say? - I only have a few semesters left and then I'm done. - guess there's no shame in staying home and taking care of the kids. - I know there's no shame in that, but that's just not what I wanna do. I don't wanna do that. There's a lot more that I wanna do. I don't wanna end up like- - Like what? - Mom, you were in your 20s when you were teaching. You easily could have gone back to work once Duncan and I went to school, and we would have been totally fine. Lots of moms went back to work back in the day. Just because you gave up your education does not mean that I have to give up mine. I know. I know that expectations were different for you back then. You thought that you had to give up your career when you became pregnant and when you were gonna start a family, but you could have gone back to work, if you really wanted to. That was a choice that you made, mom. You can't keep blaming everybody else for abandoning your own career. - Look. Look, look, look. - I didn't think they had orange in there. - Hey, come on. Come on. Come on. - Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. - We're gonna put all these in the treasure chest. - That sounds like fun. - Yeah, get it, get it. - Okay. Got it, got it, got it. - All right. What are you gonna do with it? - This. - Duncan, can we talk? - No. We're busy right now. - What's so funny. - Nothing. Yeah. Nothing. - I'm gonna go show Garrett. - What's up? - Nothing. I just needed a breather. Do you think I'm gonna end up like mom? - Is that such a bad thing? - No, I guess not, but kind of, yeah. There's just, there's a lot that I wanna do with my life. - Tonya never said it, but she felt the same way. After we had Kathryn, she never thought she quit working. - How did she do it? I'm having a hard enough time keeping my eyes open as it is. - I have no idea. She just did. I mean, I was there to help. I was changing diapers, staying up all night. I was there, and then I wasn't. I wouldn't wish what I did to her on anyone. I left her alone with the girls. She kept following her dreams though. Still is. So you should too. - You're such a sap. - You look good tonight for the party. - I know, I'm very excited. - Hey babe. I didn't expect to see you here till later. - Can I talk to you? - Yeah. One second. What's up? Are we going to the movies tonight? - I'm sorry, Tonya. - Is this about Duncan again? - What else would it be? - You're so childish. - I'm childish. - What? I can't hear you. - So how are the girls? - They're good. I see them every other weekend, and Wednesdays for the past two months. - Then you'd have more people who love and care about you than I've had in a lifetime. Most of my friends are dead. Died in the 80s from drugs, mostly HIV. I always wanted be next. But it never came from me. Thanks. Sponsor is what kept me going. You're not sinking, Duncan, but if you don't get on that boat soon. You should publish poetry you know that - Man, shut up. - I really thank you. You've been a great sponsor. - Don't say that like I'm going anywhere. - I miss this. - Yeah, I'm out here with Lilly all the time. You're more than welcome to bring the girls. I'm gonna talk to Steven tonight about going back to grad school. - Wow, are you sure you're ready? - No. Lily. She is just like her father. Totally fearless. - You mean just like her mother. - I wish. - This, you want some watermelon? - Yeah. Why can't you be home? - I mean, sometimes people just need time away from each other. Your mom and I are just taking a little time apart. - Hasn't it been long enough? Sarah's parents are getting a divorce. They're not going to be together again. - Kat, I'm not going anywhere else. I'll still be here. - That's not fair. - What do you love more than anything in the world? Missy, you love dolphins, right? - Yeah, and puppies. - What else? - Mommy and daddy and Kathryn. - What do you love? - Swimming. - Me too. What else? - My friends. - You wanna know what I love more than anything else in the world? I'm sitting on a bench with them. I wouldn't trade spending time with you guys for anything else. You remember what to say if you upset someone or you hurt them? - I'm sorry. - That's right. You remember how to show you're sorry? - I just got a lot I need to make up for. - Hey. - Hey. - They're exhausted. - Thanks for letting me know you'd be a little late. - Sure. - Thanks for the picnic, I've missed you. - I missed you too. I'm here now, and I'm not going anywhere. I love you. Goodnight. - I love you too. - Go get in bed, okay? - Okay. forgot. - What's this? - I put that off for too long. - Duncan, thanks. - See you Wednesday. - Let's go. Goodnight girls. Love you. - Lilly Marjorie? - I'm thirsty. Why are you awake, and why are you dressed like that? - Well, I am going to help people run their business. It's like how your teacher helps run your school play. You see? You wanna be a pirate, right? - No, I wanna help people. - Come here. You're so sweet. Well, it looks like we're just gonna have to go out and find some people for you to help. Now, won't we? As soon as your dad gets home, it's say goodnight and off to bed, okay? - Okay. - What's going on? Did I forget something? - No, nothing. Say goodnight. - Goodnight daddy. - Goodnight honey. What's going on? - Nothing. I did wanna talk about something, but sit down. Relax. Do you want anything? I know you must be exhausted. - Yeah, a beer. - Okay. Are you sure everything's okay? - I have been thinking a lot, and we're doing so well and I'm happy. We have two beautiful kids. I wouldn't trade that for the world. I wanna go back to school. I've looked into it. I've done all the research, and I know I can make it work. I looked over the kids' schedule. It'll be two years max. By the time I'd get out and get a job, Garrett will be going into daycare. Look, I know, it would be a change and adjustment. We would all have to make adjustments. I would need some help with the kids. - What about me? This job is important, Jessie. People depend on me. Now you want me to wipe runny noses and change the dirty diapers? - No, why would you say that? No, everything's online. I'll be able to work at my own pace, and I would take the summers off so that I could be home with Lily. - What have I been killing myself for? - Look, we can work this out. - Do you know how close I am to be named managing director? Do you know the kind of impact that will have on my career? No director is expected to babysit his own kids. You're not going back to school. That's that? We can't afford it. - No, but we can. Look, I told you. I've worked it out. I've gone over our budget, our finances. We can make it work. - So we can go back into debts. You're selfish. - I am selfish? Stephen, come on. You come home every night, smelling like beer and smoke- - Don't you judge me for supporting our family, when all you do is just lay around all day, drinking your wine, sleeping in. - Is that what you think I do? Drink wine and sleep? We have an infant. My God, I support you every single day with everything, and I ask you one thing and you, you didn't even come to Lily's play. - As I said, I've had enough. - Look, I have dreams. I have things that I wanna do that I want to accomplish. Oh, God, I am tired. Of being unappreciated. Look, being a mother is beautiful and it's awesome, but there's so much more to life that I want to accomplish and that I wanna do. I always saw it as just a chapter, a chapter of my life. I am ready to move on to the next one. I am going back to school. I am going to do this. If you don't let me, if you don't let me, then I'm leaving you. What, after all I've done for you? Jessie, I'm sorry. Here- - Thanks. I can't stay long. I'm doing ballet carpool, and Garrett has this mom being mean tumbling thing. - Well, you look terrible. - Thanks. What are these? - They're muscle relaxers, they're harmless. They are not harmless. Duncan, these are drugs. You know that, come on. - Duncan- - What? What is this? - Nothing. - Let me see it. - No, please. Don't make- - Jesus Jessie. This has gone too far. Come on. - Duncan, please. I will take care of it. Just don't make a big deal. Once he gets promoted, and once Garrett gets a little older, then- - Do you remember October 5th? I sure don't. I remember when I woke up handcuffed to a hospital bed at Presby. Two days I'd been out, two full days. You remember what you told me? You said, "You selfish asshole. I haven't showered nearly three days." You remember that? I'm here for you, Jessie. I love you, sis. Promise me you'll call if you need me. - Yeah, I will. - Promise. - I promise. I promise. - Mom. - Do you want breakfast? Are you hungry? - Hey, I don't know. - Okay. How about some oatmeal? - Sure. - How's blueberry sound? Blueberry? - I'm not hungry. - I'm sorry, I was upset. Look, I'm getting off work early tonight and we can talk. - Just like that I become a hypocrite. Where were we? Yes, Kübler-Ross model, five stages of grief. Assumptions are necessity for the categorization of life. That's the foundation of the scientific method. Assumption that Dr. Kübler-Ross later acknowledged as a collation of experiences with or without order. These are the five stages of grief. Dr. Kübler-Ross concluded these stages would occur in that order. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. She concluded that anyone suffering from terminal illness would pass through these sequential steps. - Inevitable death is and will be studied for centuries. - If we last that long millennia, because it is the one thing that will never seize. You know, if you ever wonder what connects us all together, philosophers, psychologists, biologists, nutritionist. Businessmen, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, artists, rich or poor, strong or weak. The answer is grief. How many of you have experienced the stages of grief? It's incredible. Almost everyone's raising their hands, look around. How about anger? - What I thought. How many of you have bargained? Told yourself that you give anything to see someone you've lost again? How many of you have experienced depression? The final step is acceptance. On your way out, you'll pick up two handouts. The first is your assignment. Second, a list of resources, grief counseling, suicide hotlines. For when someone you know is grieving, or when you yourselves are. See you all Monday. - You should silence your phone before class starts. Here, this is a copy of my report that I'll be submitting to the college board. Great job today. Thanks. - Hey, keep coming back. It works, if you work it. They're a great group. Byron, he's sponsored just about everyone. No, no, no. - How did this happen? - I was asleep, it was just a minute. I said, don't touch me. It is your fault. - No, no, no, no. You piece of shit. - Stop it. Stop it. I'm sorry. Sorry. Jessie, Jessie. You killed him, Jessie. What? Get your ass- You fucking killed No, I said get off. Didn't know what to do.

Get out, Duncan. I said, get out. - Duncan. Uncle Duncan. It's okay. You're okay sweetie. Dad, where's mom? I think she's in the kitchen She needs you, come on. Mom. - Martha, come here. Come here, babe. No, no, no, no. - No. - Hey, Jessie Lilly probably shouldn't be here. You can take her to my house. - It's not fair. - It's not fair at all. - You can't take her. I can't take her. - Just one night, okay? I'm so sorry. Jessie, what happened? - It was Stephen, he came home and he was drunk and he was screaming. - You're gonna be okay. Let me get some ice. I'm so sorry. I got a room for her at my house. She can borrow the girls' pajamas. I'm just worrying Steven might come back and I don't want her to be here if he does. Lilly's going to to come with us tonight. - It's okay. Duncan, will you hold that? Jess I'm gonna go talk to the police. Make sure Steven doesn't come back. We'll bring Lily back in the morning. Keep her safe. - Of course, of course. - What are you doing? - Cleaning, the place is a mess. - I'll make some tea. Thank you. - Duncan, I'd do anything for our family. - Who's watching the girls? - Sarah from next door. - You remember when you used to pick up the girls for me on cold nights. I miss that. Here, it's for your eye. - I know I can't take back anything I've done. Whatever happens, I just want you to know I still- - Uncle Duncan, aunt Tonya. - Yeah, honey. - Here- - We'll see you in the morning, okay? Uncle Duncan, aunt Tonya, I don't wanna be alone. When can I go home? - Tomorrow, your mama said so. - I'll be right here. - Make sure you pick up breakfast for her somewhere along the way. - I will. - What is it? - I just want to be there for Jessie you know. I'm Sure, Sarah can't keep watching the girls. - She's got to work. Now, go get the girls in school. Go home, get cleaned up and then I'll go back over. Duncan, last night if we- Go inside, sweetie. How is she? She's been It's the first time she's been able to sleep. - I need to talk to Jessie. I just need to make sure she's okay. It'll only take a minute. - She's in bed, Duncan. Go home and go to bed. Now, we're taking good care of Jessie. Thanks for watching Lily. - I just need to speak with her, please. - Don't you think you've done enough? Son, son, son. You know we love you. No, no, no. Byron. - Hey. I'm such a fool Jessie, I'm so sorry. Thanks for the hot cocoa. It was good. - Was it really? - It was okay. - I love you Lilly - I love you too uncle Duncan - Promise me you'll keep the high seas and your mother's safe. - Aye, aye. - Stay here with your grandparents.

Anything you need? - All right. Go get in the car. I'll be there in a second. Don't. Actually there is something. When it happened, Duncan relapsed. I was watching from the window the other day, when he came and dropped Lily off. I took him to a rehab clinic. If you wanna do something, you should go support him. - Hey, bud. We're just getting ready to head over to the viewing here shortly. Funeral's tomorrow. Jessie and Lily, they're here at the funeral home with him, so is Tonya and the girls. - Duncan. - Duncan, we've had to step back and think about a lot of things about our life. One thing we've never doubted or even had to think about that was our love for you, son. wanted to support you, Duncan. We've never known how. - I've lost everything. - No. - No. You never lost us. We're here for you, son. We will beat this thing. We're gonna do this together. - Yeah. - Thanks. - So what are you gonna do, man? - I don't know. - When's the service? - Tomorrow. - You're going? - I don't know yet. - I came out to my father 20 years ago and he just stopped talking to me. When he died, I didn't go to the funeral, man. I was high for three days. Now, I have to live with it because I never gave myself a chance to forgive him. You know they say there's two dates for an addict. We all like to talk about sobriety and throw out our little key chains and all that stuff. The more important date is the day we go all in. - I need to be there. - I thought you were in rehab. - I was. Then why are you here? I wanted to see you. Where are the girls? - At a friends'. Tonya- - Duncan, how many times are we gonna do this? God, I don't blame you for what happened to Garrett and neither does Jessie. When you came back, my heart leapt for you for a split second. You wanna know why Duncan? Because I still love you. I'll always love you no matter who you're hurting, but it's not gonna be me and sure as hell not gonna be the girls. God, you always run away. - After I slipped, those girls were all I thought about. It wasn't like before. It was about them. It's always been about them. I'm going back to rehab, but I just wanted to come by and let you know that things are different this time. I understand my problem. I understand that the reason I use heroin is to cover up pain I've always had. I'm sorry. I've been a coward and I wanted you to know that I'm going all in. - Where are we going daddy? - We're going home. ♪ I'm following all the steps of an angel ♪ ♪ I'm channeling my back to my home ♪ ♪ I'm following the footsteps of an angel ♪ ♪ Knowing in his arms I'm not alone ♪ ♪ I'm following all the steps of an angel ♪ ♪ I'm channeling my back to my home ♪ ♪ I'm following the footsteps of an angel ♪ ♪ Knowing in his arms I'm not alone ♪ ♪ In his arms I'm not alone ♪ ♪ In his arms I'm not alone ♪ ♪ Walking alone my mind hears endless chatter ♪ ♪ Telling me that my life no longer matters ♪ ♪ I pray someone who left from my canyon of shame ♪ ♪ Hoping the wind would bring your voice ♪ ♪ And call out my name ♪ ♪ Hold on because a day will come again ♪ ♪ Hold on, though the pain is strong ♪ ♪ Hold on because my love will lead you through ♪ ♪ If you hold on I'll carry you ♪ ♪ Hold on ♪ ♪ Because a day will come again ♪ ♪ Hold on ♪ ♪ I know the pain is strong ♪ ♪ Hold on because my love will lead you through ♪ ♪ If you can hold on I'll carry you ♪ ♪ All through the shattered glass ♪
