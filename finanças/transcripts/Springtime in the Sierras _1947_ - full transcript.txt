[music playing] -Roy! Hey, Roy! Look! -Oh, we're not going to hurt you. Watch him on that side! Easy now, little fella. -Golly, first fawn of the season. Must be spring. -What's the matter, little fella? You lost? -Something must have happened to his mother. She wouldn't leave him out here alone. -Well, what do we do? We can't desert him, the coyotes will get him, sure. -You know, when I was a kid around here, old Cap Foster had a place near here where he took care of all the wounded animals and little strays like this. Us kids used to call it The Cap Sanitarium. Here, hand him up to me. Tell the boys to take the horses all up to The Lazy W. I'll be up there in a little while. -All right. -Take it easy, old girl. You look like you're badly hurt. Now, hold still. [bird squawking] -Hiya, Jimmy. I thought you'd remember me. -Roy! -Hiya, Cap. -What are you doing out here? -I'm delivering some horses for The Lazy W. I brought you a patient. -Well, let me have the little fella. -I knew I'd find you up here taking care of the animals. -You'll always find me here, Roy. -Look, it must be his mother. -No doubt it is. -What happened to her, Cap? -She's been shot. Guess she dragged herself up here to see if I could help her. I don't know how badly she's hurt yet. -Shot? Well, this isn't deer season. -I know, but this is the work of professional hunters. You know, I retired from the army nearly 20 years ago, but these killers started slaughtering so much game that they deputized me to help track them down. -You mean it's a business? -Big business. There's millions in it and it's well organized. They're wiping out the natural game and wildlife of this country faster than it can be replaced. What happened to this old girl is happening to thousands of deer in the United States. They're being slaughtered by these professional hunters using every legal method in, or out of season. Ducks, geese and other game birds of America are recklessly destroyed and sold to fancy clubs in all the large cities. -The people who buy this outlawed game are as guilty as you who kill it. By killing game out of season, you are robbing every American boy of his natural heritage to hunt as a sport as protected by the law. It is people like you who slaughtered up the buffalo and the wild pigeon until they have completely disappeared. In passing sentence, it is the opinion of this court that racketeers of your type must be exposed as the lowest, most contemptible breed of all criminals. -That's a pretty bad situation, Cap. I don't blame you for coming back into this service. Is there anything I can do to help? -Not now, Roy. Maybe later. I think I'm getting closer to these killers. -Poor old girl. -So you sold some horses to The Lazy W, eh? I been wondering what they were planning to do. -I guess they're going to raise a few. Oh, by the way, how are the kids? -They're not kids anymore, Roy. Wait until you see them! Of course you and the boys are planning to stay with us. -We wouldn't stay anyplace else. -You know, Roy, whenever I have to do something like this, it makes me more determined to round up the ones responsible for these killing. -I understand, Cap. She's hurt so badly, it's the only humane thing to do. We'll see you this evening. [music playing] [gun shot] -Another one of our pals gone, Snoopy. That's all right, we'll take care of the little one, won't we? [music playing] -Catch that big sorrow and bring him over here. -Well, we got him here OK, Roy. -Good. -Ms. Loring, Roy Rogers. -So nice to meet you. -How do you do? -This is Matt Wilkes, my ranch foreman. -Hiya, Matt. -Glad to know you. -The boys told me about finding a little fawn. Where you able to its mother? -Yes. She dragged herself up to the sanitarium where Cap Foster looks after all the animals around here. She'd been shot by some hunters and was hurt so badly that she had to be destroyed. -How terrible. I don't understand how people can do things like that. Poor little fawn. -Oh, he'll be all right. Cap Foster will look after him. -The horses look fine. If you step inside, I'll pay for them now. I'd like to buy the pinto pony, too. -Oh, no. He's not for sale. -Oh? -Get all the horses into the corral, fellas. [cheering] -Let's go! Lead us back, Roy! Come on, Roy! -Don't spend all that money in one place. -Hey you, Rogers. I told you, years ago, what I was going to do to you the next time I saw you. -Yeah, I remember and I still don't think you can do it. [music playing] -Go get him! -That a boy! -You feel like giving up? -Not yet! -Oh, you've got it now! You've got it! -No, he ain't! No, he's not yet. Lacks that much, lacks that much. Hey! Help! Get me out of here! -Come on out of there! -Still think you can do it, Burt? -Yeah, I think I could with a little help. -You're a little bigger and tougher than you used to be. -Hey, you guys don't get out of the middle of the road, you're both going to need a lot of help! [cars honking] [music playing] [duck quacking] -Hurry up, Cookie, before one of these ducks lays an egg! -This'll make the magazine cover for sure! There. I think I'm all ready now. Let me see. Lights, lamps-- oh, shucks. I forgot the flash powder. -That's it. There. Come on, that's it. Big eyes, teeth. Now, you smile pretty and I'll blow the mating call. -Now, you two! Cut out that love stuff! [quacking sound] -Help! Help! Help! Oh! [groaning] -You and your mating call! -You mean, me and my home made flash powder! [duck quacking] -Roy! -Hiya, Cookie! -Doggone, am I glad to see you. You're sure lucky you weren't here a minute ago. We had the awfulest explosion you ever did hear or see. -You ought to be more careful, Cookie. What's a matter, sis? -Nothing that can't be fixed. Roy Rogers, if this thing was loaded, you'd hear another explosion around here. -Hiya, Taffy. -Hello, Roy. -Aw! -Gee, you look good. It's been a long time. -Yeah. You haven't changed much. Your face was dirty the last time I saw you. -Yeah, I guess it was. -I brought you a present. -You did? -Mmhmm. -Well, where is it? -Outside. -Oh, Roy, you didn't-- it isn't-- -Don't you remember what I promised you? -Oh, Roy. -[IN UNISON] The pinto pony! -Hello, everybody. -Hello, Jean. -Hello. -So nice to see you again, Roy. -Oh, I see you two know each other. -Oh, yes. Quite well. Oh, been hunting? -Um, you'll have to pardon us. Come on, Roy. -Excuse me. -Would you mind holding this for me? Thank you. [duck quacking] -Here, I'll take it. -Mr. Bullfincher, will you please develop this negative for me? -Surely. Have em' ready next week. -Thank you. -Burt, come to the ranch tonight. I want to talk to you. -Sure, Jean. I'll be there. -Here, Cookie. Catch! See you! [duck quacking] -Oh! No eggs! [music playing] -[SINGING] When each new day is born, I go riding where the wide open plains I roam until the sun through the hill goes riding. There will always be someone glad when I come home. -[SINGING IN UNISON] Yipee ya, yipee yo. End of day, home we go. -[SINGING] Oh, a cowboy has to sing and a cowboy has to yell or his heart would break inside of him at the gates of the home corral. There's a tired pony glad that it's over. With a song in my heart, so am I. For tonight we'll be dreaming of clover and we always will until the day we die. -[SINGING IN UNISON] Yipee ya, yipee yo. End of day, home we go. -[SINGING] Oh, a cowboy has to sing and a cowboy has to yell or his heart would break inside of him at the gates of the home corral. -[SINGING IN UNISON] Yipee ya, yipee yo. End of day, home we go. Home we go. -Ha, ha. Haven't heard you sing like that for years, Roy. You know, these two used to sing together in The Mountain View Choir. Like little angels up there. -Yeah, but they wasn't. Remember the time we tied the long rope around the-- -Never mind, Cookie. -Boys, how about singing something soft and pretty for Cap? -How about Seeing Nelly Home. -That's still your favorite, isn't it? -Always will be. Snoopy's favorite, too. [music playing] -I'll bet that song puts Cap to sleep just like it used to. -Roy, I've got to talk to you. -Well, now, nothing could be as serious as you sound. -It is serious. It's about Burt. -Is he in some kind of trouble? -No. That is, I don't know. Somehow he's changed a lot lately. -Of course he's changed, he's grown up. -I know, but it isn't that. I've raised him since his folks died and we've always been so close to each other. He doesn't talk to me anymore like he used to. -Well, he's just young. You remember how wild and harum scarum I was when I was his age. -But Burt has more money than he should have and he spends most of it on that Jean Loring. -He's big enough to take care of himself. Besides, Jean seems like a pretty nice girl to me. But if it'll make you feel any better, I'll have a talk with him and if there is anything wrong, maybe he'll tell me. -Thanks, Roy. And thank you for that pony. He's wonderful. -How about us trying him out in the morning? -It's a date. [music playing] [gun shot] [music playing] -[SINGING IN UNISON] It's springtime in the Sierras. -Well, how do you like him by now? -Oh, what do you think? -I'm sorry we missed Cap up at his sanitarium. -Yeah, so am I. He's usually there in the morning to feed the animals. What'd you find? Gold? -No, brass. This shell is from a high powered rifle. And it was fired this morning. -But, Roy, the hunting season's closed. [gun shots] -Listen. [gun shots] -That deer wasn't grazing, he's being chased. See if you can find Cap and bring him here. I might need him. -OK. [music playing] [gun shot] -I jumped two of them on this side of the draw. -Yeah, we did all right today. That bigger kid can sure smell them out. -Hey, Matt. -Where have you been? You're wet! Where's your horse? -I turned him loose. Somebody was chasing me! -Who was it? Who was it? -Roy Rogers. But he didn't get close enough to recognize me, honest, Matt! -Yeah? When friend's get nosy, we don't treat them like friends anymore. -Oh, but, Matt, listen-- -Shut up. You can go back with us. -All right, all of you! Drop those guns! Get your hands up! Quick! Higher! I'd just soon kill you in cold blood like you do those deer. It's time I caught up with you filthy cowards. Using silencers, telescope sites, camouflage jackets, a fine bunch. -Oh, but listen, Cap-- -Shut up, Burt. -Yes. There's nothing you can say. I'm sorry you're in this, Burt. It's too bad. A young fellow like you get mixed up in this sort of thing. After what your sister's gone through to raise you to be a decent man. I'd do anything not to hurt your sister, Burt, but you're going to have to come along with the rest of them. It's the end of a long, bloody trail. All right, get your horses. Let's get out of here. -Drop that gun, Captain Foster. Put up your hands! -I was afraid this would happen sooner or later. Pick up your guns, boys. I'll give you a chance to explain. This is going to hurt a little bit. [gun shot] -Cap! -Burt! -Cap! -Get up. One more break like that and you won't be able to. -You didn't have to murder him! -I didn't murder him. Take him over to that place where he feeds the animals and put this in his hand. Now, get this straight. Captain Foster just accidentally shot himself. -Hello, Burt. -Hello, Roy. -Burt, I want to talk to you. -What do you want? -Were you riding the horse this morning with the R brand on him? -No, I wasn't. Anything else? -No, that's all except that Cap Foster's dead. -How'd it happen? -He accidentally shot himself. Found him up at his sanitarium. You better go in and see your sister. She's taken it pretty badly. -Sure, Roy. -The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Amen. -[SINGING] Amen. [music playing] [music - "seeing nelly home"] -Well, that's all, Cap, except there's going to be a lot of us miss you. There's going to be a lot of the animals miss you, too, Cap, but you can rest easy because I'll come up here every evening and take care of them just like you did. [squirrel chirping] -You, too, Snoopy. -Boys, I think we ought to stick around a few days and fix the place up a little for Taffy and Burt. -[IN UNISON] Yeah, that's a good idea. -Yes, it is. Say, it was sure swell of Cap to leave those two kids the ranch. -Hey, Roy, here's those pictures you wanted. -Thanks. Hello, Jimmy. Boys, I think Cap Foster was murdered. -Murdered? -Cap Foster was the safest man in the world with a gun. You know that, Cookie. -The coroner said the bullet that killed him came from his own gun. -The gun was fired right against his chest, powder burns proved that. -And he was left hand. -That's right. -Well, whoever shot him and left him laying up here didn't know that. They place the gun in his right hand. -Woo wee. We ought to tell the Sheriff. -Not yet, Cookie. -But if he was murdered, he oughta know. -Yeah! -Let the law catch him! -Wait a minute. We've got to make sure we're right first, so fellas, don't say a word about this to anybody. -OK. -All right. -If you say so. [giggling] -Snoopy! Come on, get out of there! You can't spend the winter in there, now. -Hello, Burt. -Hi. -Nice load this week, thanks to you. -Jean, I came over to tell you, I can't work for you anymore. -Burt says he can't work for us anymore. -What's the matter, Burt? Aren't you happy? Don't we treat you right? -Oh, it's not that. I've got to run the ranch that Cap left us now and well, I won't have time. -I think you'll find time, Burt. Don't forget how you and your sister got that ranch. -And I wish we didn't have it. I can't sleep nights. I keep thinking of-- ow! -Any time you get tired of your job here, just remember that you're an accessory to Cap Foster's unfortunate accident. -But I'm afraid of Roy. He saw me that day and I know he suspects something. He may trail me again. -Maybe he will trail you again. Maybe we want him to trail you again. It'll be the last trailing he ever does. -Oh, but Roy is my-- -You see, we can't afford to lose you now. We've got too much tied up in all this and so have you. I have a few plans for this community and they include you. You run up to the house now and wait for me. I have some money for you. -OK, Jean. -Sure, Burt. Everything's going to be all right, forget it! -He don't seem to be so stuck on you anymore. -Oh, he'll be OK. I guess the funeral got him. -What's this plans for the community stuff. -I'm going to give a big charity social here, at The Lazy W. It's to be a basket party with the proceeds to go to a memorial fund for Captain Foster. -Are you crazy? Do you want this place overrun with yokels? You know how nosy people can get. -Sometimes I wonder what you use for brains, Matt. Don't you see, this will make us established, respected members of this community. It's just the old con game. Make people like you and they'll believe anything. It's going to be a wonderful party. We might even have a kissing booth! [music playing] [laughter] -Well, folks. First, before we auction off the lunches, I think we ought to thank our hostess, Ms. Jean Loring, for a swell party. [applause] -Now, I got a surprise for you. A couple of folks here have prepared a song. Our own Taffy Baker and a boy that you'll remember that used to sing around here in the choir, Roy Rogers. Roy, let's give them a hand and have some nice fun. -[SINGING] I took a trip to Mexico to spend a week, or two. And there I met the finest fellow that I ever knew. His name was Pedro from Acapulco and he goes about just singing all the day. He is Pedro from Acapulco and his song will surely win your heart away. The girls adore him, keep waiting for him, for he brings a little sunshine when he smiles. And when he goes strolling by all the senoritas cry. Viva, Pedro from Acapulco. He's singing all day long his merry little song and who can say it's wrong? Viva, Pedro from Acapulco. -[SINGING IN SPANISH] -The sooner we get rid of that cowhand, the better. I've got a ways of doing it so no one will ever know. -Not until I say so. Two accidents around here in a row might not look so good. We can't stand any investigations. -That's what I mean. Rogers is a nosy amateur. -That's why I want to find out just how much he knows before anything happens to him. -[SINGING IN SPANISH] -Thanks, Taffy! And thanks, Roy! And now, folks, we've come to the most important part of the whole evening, food! Each one of these little lunch baskets has got the name of a girl who fixed it. And the highest bidder gets to share it with her. Here's a little-- little basket that's got a lot of big surprises with it. And you'll never guess who made it. [owl hooting] -No, that's a surprise. [owl hooting] -You better get out of here before somebody puts you in a cigar. [owl hooting] -All right, who'll start it out? How much am I offering? -$1! -$1 I've got! Who'll make it $2? Do I hear $2? -Only $2! -No, no! -Come on, make it $3! -$3! -$3! Do I hear $4? Who'll make it $4? Sold for $3! Ms. Willow Crunch! -Here I am, here I am! Here! -There he is! [laughing] -Oh, you big, handsome man! Handsome man! -Nothing but olives! She's on a diet! [laughing] -Now, here's a little goody. Ah, smells like real living! Let's don't be cheap. Come on, start it off with a big bid! Which one of you gents will make it $2? Take a chance and see what lovely lady made this one! All right, who's going to start it off? How much am I offered? -$1000! -One thou-- Oh. $1 the man bid. Who'll make it $2? -$10! -Roy! -Sold! -That's not my lunch! -It isn't? Wonder who's it is. -Jean Loring! -Right here! -Here's a lunch fit for a king! Let me take a peek, see what's in here. -You want to sit here? -You'll never guess! -It's awfully noisy out here. -It sure is. -Let's go into the house where it's quiet. -Fine. -$1! -$1 the man says. Who will make it $4? -$1! -Brother, you bought something. Bring me the dollar. -Just put the lunch down on the table. I'll stir up the fire a little. -This party of yours is a fine thing, Jean. I'm sure Cap Foster's friends all appreciate it. -I hope so. It's the least I can do. [music playing] -I see you like guns. -Yes, my father taught me to shoot and ride when I was a little girl. -I'll bet he did a good job of it, too. -This one's a beauty. It was made in Austria before the war. Handles well and hits like a cannon. -Do you have trouble finding ammunition for it? -Yes. That's why I don't use it often. I'm starving. You spread the lunch and I'll go get some coffee. [music playing] -Let's have some food now. -Good. -Tuna or chicken? -Either one. I'm not fussy. -Sorry it isn't something more solid. -So am I. A little cold venison would be good. -Isn't there a season of some kind on deer? -Yes, but the deer don't know it. Neither do the people who buy them. -The law does. -Really? Well, that's interesting. -Depends on what you're interested in. -Right now, it's food. -Thanks for taking my plate. -Come on, break it up! How long can a guy live without breathing? -Step aside, boy. Let a man get with it! -Now wait a minute, Pat! Let's be humane about this. All right. -Well, one thing about that Jean, she sure knows how to throw a party. -Yes, her talents seem to run in many directions. -You know, Taffy, I think you're getting just a little jealous and there's no reason for it. -That was a swell lunch, Jean. -Thanks. -Too bad Burt didn't get it. -Why Burt? -He seems to be pretty interested in you. -Oh, Burt? He used to be around here a lot, but it was just puppy love. -Oh? -We'd better get back to the party. After all, I am the hostess. -My hat. -Excuse me. -Oh, Bob? -Pardon. -Do me a favor and round up the boys and play that old tune that Cap likes so well, will you? -Right now? -Mmhmm. -I'm going to get my coat and go home. -Taffy, now wait a minute! -Well, Burt, how'd you like your lunch? -Oh, OK, I guess. [music playing] -It's funny they should play that old tune. Sure brings back memories. -Burt, I'd like to talk to you, do you mind? -No, go ahead, Roy. -You know, you told me you weren't riding an R brand horse the other morning, remember? -That's right. -You were lying, Burt. Why? -What do you mean? Listen, Roy, why don't you go back to your ranch instead of looking for trouble? -Because I like it here and because I'm going to find out who killed Captain Foster. -The coroner said he was killed accidentally. -That's not so and you know it. -Are you accusing me? -You got the ranch, didn't you? -Roy! Stop it! Stop it! You know you can whip him! -Leave us alone, sis. I started this and I'm going to finish it. -Burt, what's wrong with you? You're acting like a child. -They're not children. Leave them alone! -Take your hands off me! -Take it easy, kid. -Leave me alone, Matt. -This makes you a pretty brave guy, don't it, Rogers. -Stay out of this, Matt. I can fight my own battles. -Sure, sure. I know. Why don't you pick on somebody your own size? -What are you sticking your nose into this for? This fight isn't between you two. -It's all right, Cookie. He's big enough. -Burt! -Yeah, sis? -Take me home! Please, take me home! [screaming] -Come on! -Come on, Roy! Come on, boy! -Hey, who you shoving, Betty? -Come on-- Come on, Roy! Come on-- [cheering] [screaming] -Nice going, Roy. -Take him back to the bunkhouse, boys, and get him cleaned up. -I'm sorry about this, Jean. -Never mind. Thanks for teaching Matt a lesson. He had no business interfering. -Come on, fellas, [inaudible] up the joint. Let's get the party started. Come on, Bob! Everybody, listen! -Aw! -What does your fortune say today, Cookie? -Huh? Oh, nothing. Nothing. -Never trust a fat man. Oh, now, Roy. You know, you never can believe one of those things. Come on in. Roy, I sure hate to say this to you, but you sure made it a fool out of yourself at Jean's social. What you said to Burt was a little rough. -That's what I want to talk to you about, Cookie. I did it on purpose. I had to find out, for sure, about Burt. -Burt? You mean he's mixed up in Cap's murder and everything? -I'm afraid he is. -Why that little-- -What do you know about Jean Loring and her friend Matt? -Oh, nothing much, just accept they come out here from somewhere in the east. I got a lease on The Lazy W for them and they put in some improvements and some new equipment. Got the place looking right nice. -What kind of equipment? -Oh, the average stuff. It was pretty run down. Seems to me that Gus down at the transfer company did say they shipped in the largest refrigerating plant that he ever did haul. -Refrigerating plant? -Yeah. I guess them city folks like that frozen food. -They might use it for storage. -Oh, not that much. They raise horses, not beef. -They could store things worth a lot more than beef. Like geese and ducks and venison. -Yeah. Hey, look at this. -It's Burt. -They sure talking turkey to him. -I think we better do the same thing. -Here it is, Taffy. 648. Want me to get it for you? -No thanks, Pat. I'll get it. -[INTO PHONE] 648, please. -Hello? -Hello, Lazy W? Oh. Well, this is Taffy Baker. Could I please speak to my brother, Ms. Loring? -Just a moment. Oh, Burt? -What is it? -You're wanted on the telephone. It's your sister. -Oh. -Hello. Yes, of course I'm all right. -Well, when are you coming home? Burt! Burt, you can't mean-- hello? Hello, Burt? -What's the matter? Anything wrong? -He said he's not coming home. He hung up on me. -Where are you going? -To The Lazy W to see Burt. -You want someone to go along with you? -No thanks, Pat. This is a private affair. -Hi, fellas. -Hello, Roy. -Where's Burt? -Still up at The Lazy W. Says he's not coming back. -Does Taffy know? -Yes, she's on her way up there now. -You better wait here, Cookie. [music playing] -Taffy! Hey, Taffy! Wait a minute! -Go away! -I want to talk to you! -Go away and leave me alone! -Come on, boy! -Put me down! Put me down! -Wait a minute, Taffy! -Haven't you caused me enough trouble? Put me down! -But you can't go up there, you'd be in danger and so would Burt. -Why? -Because Cap Foster was murdered. -Murdered? Cap, murdered? -Yes and I think Burt knows who did it. -Oh, Roy. How would Burt know about it? -I don't know, but that's what I have to find out and I might need your help, Taffy. -Oh, sure, Roy. [phone ringing] -Hello? Yeah. Just a minute. It's Cookie. Ask him if he knows where Rogers is. -Hello, this is Jean. Have you seen Roy? He's there. And my pictures are ready? -Uh huh. They're all ready. -I'll be right down for them. Thank you very much. What a break for us, Matt. Hang on, I'll be right back. -Roy, this is just like messing around with a bear trap. -There's nothing else I can do, Cookie. If they're setting a trap for me, I'll just have to be lucky and spring it first. -That's all right, if you're tired of living. -Did you ever hear of the wooden horse of Troy? -Huh? -You remember that old story of how the Greeks captured the city of Troy? They built a big wooden horse, put some soldiers inside of it. The people of Troy didn't know they were in there, pulled it inside the gates. When night came, the soldiers came out and captured the place. -Well, where you going to get a horse that big? -Maybe Trigger's big enough. -Well, how you going to hide in Trig-- Oh, ain't going to hide me in no horse. Besides, I don't think Trigger would like it. -Here she is now. -Don't forget to turn on the charm. -Don't you forget to play the right notes. [music playing] -[SINGING] With a little imagination anyone can dream a bit. And this farm of recreation has never heard anyone yet. Imagine me as a city dude with a silk hat, cane, and spats. Oh, what a picture I would make. -[SINGING] Say, ain't he the cats! -[SINGING] Imagine me as a jungle gent fighting lions just for fun. [growling] -[SINGING] Oh, what a picture I would make. -[SINGING] Say, ain't he the one. -[SINGING] I'm Corporal Roy, I'm a drummer boy back in '76. Or I can be just a jitterbug dancing to some hot licks. -Ga voot! -[SINGING IN UNISON] Imagine us as a bride and groom as the marriage vows we make. Oh, what a picture we would take-- -[SINGING] If the camera didn't break! [laughter] -I got your pictures of the party all finished. They turned out swell. -Well, thanks so much for calling me. -Here you are. That'll be $1. Thank you. -There you are. -Hello, Taffy. -Don't you hello me, Roy Rogers. You'll find your luggage out front. -But he can't stay here, Taffy. -You keep out of this, Cookie. -Yes, ma'am. -I don't care if I never see you again. [crashing] -She'll never get over this. Neither will that door. -I think you're right, Cookie. -Well, gee, Roy. I haven't got any room here. -Yeah, I know. -The invitation to The Lazy W is still open. -I wouldn't want to put you out any. -You wouldn't, there's plenty of room. Why don't you get your things and we'll ride out together. -You just talked him into it. Why don't you, Roy? -All right. Thanks. I'll see you later, Cookie. -Yeah. -Hey, Cookie. -It's you, Taffy! I didn't know you in the outfit. -Well, how's I do? -You did swell. I think we sold her. I think you over did it on the door. If I'd have known, I would have charged her $4 for the picture. -Matt, we have a guest. Roy is going to stay with us for a few days. -Sorry about the other day, Rogers. I kind of lost my head, I guess. But you're more than welcome here as far as I'm concerned. -Well, I've forgotten about that, Matt. -Why don't you take your things over to the bunk house? I'll see you later. -Thanks, Jean. -Well, that was easy. -Sure. -You know, I think he kind of likes you. -Really? Maybe he'll change his mind. [laughing] -Oh, that sure was good. [chattering] -Woo ooh! Why, you didn't eat! -Yeah, I know, Cookie. I'm not very hungry. I'm worried about Roy. He said he'd phone an hour ago. -Don't worry about it. -Don't worry about him. -Give him a little time. He'll call. -Well, I hope so. -Why don't you run on, Taffy? We'll do the dishes, won't we boys? -Oh, sure. -Don't we always? -Yeah, but let's get going. [music playing] -[SINGING] Now, listen, all you renegades, to what I've got to say. You better start to settle down and save your extra pay. In 45, or 50 years, we'll all be old and grey. Did any of you ever stop to think, what are you going to do then? -[SINGING IN UNISON] Oh, what are you going to do then? Oh, what are you going to do then? -[SINGING] When you are old, your feet get cold. Pat, what you going to do then? -[SINGING] If I keep packing this heavy load, I'll be all wrinkled like a horny toad and they'll use my ribs for a scrubbing board when I get old and grey. -[SINGING IN UNISON] Oh, what are you going to do then? Oh, what are you going to do then? -[SINGING] When your bones all rattle and you can't herd cattle, Hugh, what are you going to do then? -[SINGING] Well, I'll learn the lingo of the Choctaw, and then I'll marry me an Indian squall, so we can live with her ma and pa when I get old and grey. -[SINGING] Oh, what are you going to do then? Oh, what are you going to do then? -[SINGING] When you're down and out with the pain in gout, Cookie, got any ideas? -I'll sing as sweet as an old bullfrog, eat skeet, or skoot and pollywogs and sleep all winter in a holly log when I get old and grey. -[SINGING] Oh, that's what we're going to do then. Oh, that's what we're going to do then. When the bones all rattle and they can't herd cattle, that's what we're going to do then! [crashing] -Cookie! -It wasn't my fault. I was crow-- see, I didn't break all of-- [crashing] -Oh! -I'm so nervous now, I-- Oh, Cookie, I wish you'd stop clowning. [sound of machinery] -Go on in. Take a good look. -Yes, it's venison and we get a fancy price for it. That's what you were looking for, isn't it? -This is what Cap Foster was looking for. -That's right. You know what happened to him. -You can't shoot me. Even if you made this one look like an accident, too, there would be an investigation. You don't want that. -Get a rope, Matt. We have no intention of shooting you. Take off your coat, Rogers. [music playing] -Don't shoot! Get the boys! -It's a good thing I got back here in time, or you'd be up on one of those meat hooks. -Yeah. I was doing all right. When he gets good and cold, there won't be a coroner in the state could tell what happened to him. He'll just be found dead somewhere out in the hills. No bullet holes, no nothing. -Hey, Jean. -Yeah? -I forgot to tell you. The boys said Burt packed up and left. -When? -About a half hour ago. -Well, why didn't you tell me? -What chance did I have? -We've got to stop that kid somehow. He's about ready to break. I have a hunch where he'll go before he leaves. Get your horse. -You still like me, don't you, Snoopy? [bird squawking] -Hello, Jimmy. I just came up to say goodbye to Cap and you. Want to shake hands, say goodbye? That a boy. -Oh, now. Don't you worry. Cookie and sis are going to take good care you. Up you go. [music playing] -Hello, Burt. Going somewhere? -Yeah, I'm clearing out. -Don't you think we ought to talk about it? -You've already done too much talking to me. You said you were only going to kill game, but you killed Cap. -I'm sorry, Burt, but I had to. -But somebody will find out. -If it's Roy you're worried about, you can forget it. Soon he'll never leave the ranch alive. -Roy? Well, you can't do that, Jean. You've got let Roy go! I'll take the blame for killing Cap. -What's eating you, kid? -I can't sleep nights thinking of Cap lying out there with a bullet through him. Oh, I know, it's partly my fault, but I'll take all the blame, if you let Roy go. I don't want that to be on my conscience, too. -I'm afraid it's a little late for that, Burt. Roy knows everything and he'll never keep quiet. Isn't that right? -Sure. Maybe Burt would like to have a little talk with Roy and get straightened out in his own mind. Get on your horse. [music playing] -Roy! Roy! Roy, are you-- you dirty murderers! -You double crossing, little-- -I'll check your coat for you. -Jean! Jean, if you shot Roy like you did Cap-- -Shut up! -Your friends taking a little nap now. When he wakes up, you two can have your little talk. -This is better than you deserve. I understand freezing's an easy way to die. -Ms. Loring? You're wanted on the telephone. -Well, thanks. I'll take it out here. -Hello? -Hello, Ms. Loring? Well, this is Taffy Baker. Oh, I'm fine, thank you. Are Roy and Burt there? -No. I haven't seen either of them. -Oh, I see. You haven't seen them at all? No. No, nothing important. Thank you very much. I can't understand it. She wouldn't even let me talk to Roy. [chattering] -Well, maybe she had a good reason. -Cookie, can't we do something? -Saddle up, boys. I got an idea. -Where you going? -I'm going down to transfer company to talk to Gus about a wooden horse. -A wooden horse? -Sounds crazy to me, too, but let's get going. -Hiya, Burt. -Roy! I thought you were-- -No. I never felt better in my life. -I'm sorry about everything, Roy. I told them I'd take the blame if they let you go. -Forget it, Burt. Right now, our problem is to get out of here. I'm getting the handle of this. You got a match? -No, but there's a lighter in my right hip pocket. I'll see if I can get it. -Over a little bit, Burt. -I got it. -Burt? This isn't going to be much fun. I think I can burn the rope in two without hurting you too much. -Sure, Roy. Go ahead. It's better than freezing here. -I'll try it here, but your wrists. Maybe I can do it without catching your clothes on fire. -Roy? -Yeah. -I saw them shoot Cap. -Who? -Jean. Cap caught us red handed. They never gave him a chance. -Butchers. They deserve the same thing. Can you take it a couple of seconds more, Burt? -Keep going. -There it is. [music playing] -Here, you better put this on. This place is built like a fort and we might be here for quite awhile. One good thing, this door swings out. We might be able to use this. Give me a hand. We can use thing for a battering ram. -That makes a lot of noise, Roy. -Well, we can't help it. We got to get out of here. -Come on, Cookie! Can't you go any faster? -Not without a pilot's license, I can't. -The lock's giving. A couple more times ought to do it. -Ms. Loring! -There's some rifles in the tack room. -Good! [music playing] -It's just around the bend. -Hold this, I'll saddle your horse. -Block the other entrance. -Thanks, Burt, but you didn't have to do that. -Roy-- Roy, I can't move my legs. Am I hurt bad? -We'll get out of here, Burt. Take it easy. -Tell Taffy I'm sorry about everything and take care of her. Roy. I still think I can whip you. -Sure, you can, Burt. Why, in no time, you'll be-- [music playing] -Back end's covered now. -Get on the other side of the fence and cover me. I'm going in. You stay here, this may be a little rough. [music playing] -Don't let him get away! -Look out! -End of the line! Come on out, if you're still able! -Hey, Cookie! They've taken the North Trail. -Come on out, boys! -Hurry up, fellas! [music playing] -Hey, Taffy! Like this! -I did it. Looks like she's going to need some beauty treatments. -Where she's going, they don't give beauty treatments. -You know, Roy, I've lived in the west all my life, I never saw so many people chasing so many people! [owl hooting] [music playing] -[SINGING] Now, the long day is through on the prairie. There's a low hanging sun in the sky. Down the home corral we will carry and we'll sing of the round ups in the days gone by. -[SINGING IN UNISON] Yipee ya, yipee yo. End of day, home we go. -[SINGING] For a cowboy has to sing and a cowboy has to yell, or his heart would break inside of him at the gates of the home corral. -We're going to miss you around here, Roy. -The boys are going to miss you, too. -The boys? -So am I, Taffy. -All right, break it up.
