FOR THE LATEST ON THE FREEWAY FELON, WE GO LIVE TO TRICK TURNER AT THE FIRST A.M.E. CHURCH. TRICK? I'M STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW WITH MR. LIBOWITZ. MR. LIBOWITZ IS GONNA SHED SOME LIGHT ON THE SITUATION FOR US. MR. LIBOWITZ, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE ORDEAL? AS I STATED TO YOU OVER THE PHONE, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM ANOTHER CLIENT OF MINE... WHO ASKED ME TO REPRESENT MR. DOUGLAS. THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE FOR ME TO STIPULATE AT THIS TIME. MOTHERFUCKER. BACK TO YOU, JERRY. THANK YOU FOR THAT BIT OF INFORMATION. THE TWO-TIME FELON WAS RELEASED ON PAROLE MINUTES BEFORE THE SHOOTING. YO, J.J., YOU WATCHIN' THIS SHIT? I'M PEEPIN' THIS SHIT, MAN. I HOPE THEY HURRY AND KILL THAT MOTHERFUCKER... BEFORE I CAN STOP SWEATING THIS SHIT. YOU THINK THAT FOOL IS GONNA SNITCH ON YOU? NIGGA, IT'S EITHER HIM OR ME. WE ALMOST GOT HIM! SHIT. NIGGA, GET IN! GET IN! HOW'D YOU FIND ME? YOU ALL OVER THE NEWS, MY WEEBLE-IZATION. SUSPECT IS HEADING WEST ON TAYLOR IN A GREEN S.U.V. WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN? THEY TRIPPIN', MAN. THEY TRYIN' TO KILL ME AND STUFF. OH, MAN, MAN, MAN! NOT SOME MORE HELICOPTERS! COME ON, MAN! GO, GO, GO! BE ADVISED WE HAVE SPOTTED SUSPECT IN GREEN S.U.V. HE IS HEADED YOUR WAY TOWARD THE COMMAND POST... AT THE FIRST A.M.E. CHURCH, OVER. WE ON THE NEWS! WE ON THE NEWS, MAN! HOW WE GONNA GET AWAY WHEN WE ON THE NEWS? THEY KNOW WHERE WE GOIN'! MAN, YOU HOTTER THAN GONORRHEA. - WE GOT HIM! WE GOT HIM! - BE CAREFUL! WE GOT HIM HEMMED IN! THERE'S NO WAY HE'S GONNA GET OUT. OH, SHIT! WHERE THE HELL IS HE GOING? - BACK IT UP! BACK IT UP! - HELL, MAN. SLOW DOWN. SLOW DOWN, DUDE. DON'T TRIP. I GOT THE LAWYER POSTED UP LIKE A THUMBTACK... WAITIN' AT THE CHURCH HOUSE, WEEBLE-IZATION. SO, MR. LIBOWITZ, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND FOR THE LIFE OF ME... - OH, SHIT. - I THINK YOU HIT SOMEBODY! OH, SHIT. OH, GODDAMN. GO, GO, GO, GO, GO! HOLD YOUR FIRE! HOLD YOUR FIRE! DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN! - AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE THE SUSPECT. - I'M DOWN, I'M DOWN, I'M DOWN! DON'T MOVE. WE GOT HIM, GUYS. DON'T MOVE! HE'S DOWN. HE'S FACE DOWN. YES, STAN, HE IS, AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE OFFICERS HAVE THE SUSPECT IN CUSTODY. - STAN, BACK TO YOU ON THE GROUND. HE IS ERECT. HE IS STANDING ON HIS OWN TWO FEET. HE SEEMS NONE THE WORSE FOR WEAR. THE SAGA OF ROBERT DOUGLAS IS OVER. I LOVE THIS MAN. YOUR HONOR, THIS GIBBERISH ABOUT THE DEFENDANT FEARING FOR HIS LIFE IS TOTALLY LUDICROUS. APPARENTLY, COUNSEL WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOCKERY OUT OF THIS SITUATION... - AND AMELIORATE THE CHARGES. - AMELIORATE? WHAT THAT MEAN? YOUR HONOR, THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS, NOT TO MENTION LUDICROUS! COUNSEL, APPROACH THE BENCH. I DIDN'T PLAN TO SPEND THE WHOLE DAY IN HERE, YOU KNOW. I STRONGLY ADVISE IF YOU HAVE A POINT TO MAKE, MAKE IT. LET'S GET OVER WITH IT. I ALREADY LISTENED TO THE TAPE IN MY CHAMBERS... THAT CLEARLY PROVES THAT MR. DOUGLAS... IS NOT AT FAULT WITH THE SHOOTING THAT OCCURRED, NOR DID HE HAVE KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT CAR WAS STOLEN. NEED I SAY MORE? OOH! GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY. SHIT. YOUR HONOR, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ALL FORMAL CHARGES DISMISSED... AND TO HAVE MY CLIENT RELEASED FROM CUSTODY IMMEDIATELY. YOUR HONOR, I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH DROPPING THE CHARGES FOR GRAND THEFT AUTO... OR SHOOTING AT A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. HOWEVER, THE DEFENDANT DID FAIL TO REPORT TO HIS PAROLE OFFICER AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME, HE COULDN'T DO IT. WHICH IS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF HIS PAROLE. NOT TO MENTION THE CHARGES FOR EVADING AND RESISTING ARREST. I WASN'T RESISTING ARREST. THEY WAS JUST WHOOPIN' MY ASS. - YOU TELL 'EM, BABY. - ORDER! NOW, COOL WITH THE ATTITUDE. I THINK WE GOT IT OUR WAY. YOUR HONOR, IF IT WOULD PLEASE THE COURT, AND TO AVOID ANY DIFFICULTY WITH THIS ARRAIGNMENT, MY CLIENT HAS AGREED TO ACCEPT THE PAROLE VIOLATION. - DID HE? - YOUR HONOR, I CONCUR WITH THE MOTION. VERY WELL. MR. DOUGLAS, ARE YOU AWARE OF THE CHAOS... YOU HAVE CAUSED IN THE LAST THREE DAYS? YOU ARE INDIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENDANGERING... THE LIVES OF OTHERS AS WELL AS YOUR OWN... AND CREATING A MASS-MEDIA HYSTERIA, NEARLY STARTING A RIOT IN FRONT OF A VERY PROMINENT CHURCH. YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY FOR YOURSELF? NO, MAN. I... HONOR... Y-YOUR HONOR. MR. DOUGLAS, I SENTENCE YOU... TO REMAIN IN CUSTODY FOR VIOLATING CONDITIONS OF YOUR ORIGINAL PAROLE... FOR A PERIOD NOT TO EXCEED 30 DAYS. THIS WILL NOT COUNT AS A THIRD STRIKE. THIS COURT IS ADJOURNED. SON, WHEN YOU GET OUT THIS TIME, HAVE YOUR ASS OUT FRONT. I'M GONNA PICK YOU UP MYSELF. MAKE SURE YOUR ASS GET HOME THIS TIME. YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, BABY. I'LL WAIT FOR YOU ANOTHER YEAR. LOVE YOU. I TOLD YOU THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN. KNUCKLEHEAD. - YOU SHUT UP. - SHH! IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL. OH, BABY. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? YEAH! GET... PUSH-UPS, HOMEY. HEY, HOMEY. OH, KITCHEN PUSSY'S BACK. WHOA. COME ON. # HEY, J.J. NIGGA, THIS IS FAIZ... CUT! OH! HEY, J.J. NIGGA, WHAT'S UP? THIS IS ROB, NIGGA. CUT! YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT THE LITTLE HOMEY STUCK. I TOLD YOU I AIN'T HAD NOTHIN' TO DO WITH THAT. LOOK, MAN. THE POLICE PICKED US UP. NO, WE WENT TO THE, UH... McDONALD'S? PAY NO ATTENTION TO HIM. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE NOW. BABY, JUST LET ME EXPLAIN. STUCK. CAN'T GET OUT. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? HOLD IT, HOLD IT. I'M A GROWN-ASS MAN. WAIT A MINUTE, GIRL. WAIT. CLOSED-CAPTIONED BY CAPTIONS, INC.
