(funky music) - I first moved into this dump, excuse me, lovely apartment in June. It was a sweltering day. I love that word, sweltering, it kinda reminds me of melting vanilla ice cream. The rent's $2975 a month, marked down from $3750. What a bargain! Wait you're not actually filming this are you? I first moved into this dump, excuse me, lovely and glamorous apartment in June. It was a sweltering day. The rent is $2975 a month, marked down from $3750. What a bargain for all this luxury! Notice how every apartment in New York City is a "luxury" apartment these days? It's luxury or it's the streets, nothing in between. Finding an apartment is hard enough, actually getting that apartment is damn near impossible. You can't just pay first and last and security deposit and move in in New York anymore. You have to make 40 times the rent in a year. Which, for this dump, excuse me, lovely, luxury apartment, so intimate and convenient, and such a prime location in the heart of the East Village. You know, where all the artists live. (laughing) So much character, so much life. Vibrance, electric. For this lovely apartment, marked down to the bargain basement price of just $2975 a month. Multiply that by 40 and you just have to make $119,000 a year. Yeah, that's not happening being a part time DJ and full time underground superstar. Luckily, I was able to find two cute art students to move in with me. We still can't afford it. We scrimp and save and scam and steal our way from month to month. Somehow we survive. How was that? - It was good. But try to be a little more natural. - Natural? I'm done. (funky drone music) Guys! The rent is due next week! - Working on it. (sighs) (funky music) - We have a potential Share B&B person this weekend. Should I accept? - Yes! - Okay. It's your turn to be the hostess. - Already? - Yes. Tarik. It's your turn to be the... - Worm! (softly chuckles) (funky music) - C'mon we're gonna be late for our classes. Damn it! (knocking) - [Sparkle] Yeah? - [Tarik] C'mon, Sparkle. - [Sparkle] Just a second! (groans) - C'mon, let's go. (funky music) - [Man] Tarik, what have you got for us today? (sighs) - My parents and I were walking down the street. We were in Miami, I can't remember why. I was just a little boy. It was just after 9/11. We were getting looks. Scared white women grabbed their children and held them close, as if we would explode at any moment, as if holding them in their frail arms would make any difference. My mother was horrified. She wanted to go back to the hotel. My father refused. I saw him smile. My father never smiled. But he was smiling now as he walked defiantly down the street. He basked in the fear all around us. Drunk with power, this sad, broken man who had never so much as cracked a smile in front of me, he was smiling now. And not just any smile. a big shit eating grin. My mother tried to pull me away from him. My father reached down and grabbed my hand. My father never touched me, not a pat on the head or a slap across the face. Nothing. He was holding my hand now, squeezing it tight as he pulled me along with him. His hand was strong, calloused and rough, dark, almost gray, like elephant skin. It felt good. Damp and warm. I wanted to curl up in that hand and take a nap. But he kept pulling me along. We were going somewhere in a hurry. I had no idea where then and I have no idea where now. I saw two men walk out of a building. They were handsome, wearing brightly colored shirts and shorts. One was white with sun bleached hair, the other was dark like my father. They took hold of each other and something inside of me stirred. My heart started pounding as if for the first time. They were holding each other so close, the white one reached down and grabbed the dark one's ass through his cut off jeans. My heart was fluttering. I felt like I was flying, leaving my body, then my father reached over with his other hand and covered my face. His hand was warmer and damper, wet even, as if drenched in sweat. I could feel the blood pounding through it. I could still see through the cracks of my father's hand. The two men kissed. Burrowing their tongues in each others mouths. My father's hand held me tighter, and I struggled to breathe. I opened my mouth gasping for air and I could taste the salty sweet sweat now dripping from my father's hand. "Faggots." I heard him say, "Faggots." So softly. I could barely hear him. As if he was practicing the line, trying to remember what to say. Then he said it again, shouting it this time. "Faggots!" My mother grabbed me, pulling me away from my father. I took one deep breath and looked up at the men. The white one yelled back, "Fuck off, Al Qaeda." Then the dark one joined in, "Takes one to know one sweetie." I looked up at my father, and his face was flush red. His forehead now dripping that salty sweet sweat. I saw his lip tremble ever so slightly, as he said, in a calm low voice, "Every last one of them. "The world won't be safe "until every last one of them is dead." (footsteps clacking) It's 2016. I am dancing at the club. I've had a few drinks. I'm having fun. It's when I hear the first gun shot. There is panic on the dance floor. Everyone runs in every direction, suddenly unaware of the location of the entrances and exits. I hear more gunshots. They sound like they're coming from all around me, like a surround sound demonstration before the trailers start in a movie. I see a lit doorway, and I run towards it. I am in the restrooms. The gender neutral rest rooms. There is no way out and the sound of the gun shots is definitely getting closer. I see an open stall, and I run towards it, opening the flimsy door, closing it behind me, and locking it. I sit down on the broken toilet seat. With every new gun shot, a scream is silenced until there is no more screaming. I can hear Lady Gaga over the sound system, hiccuping. (humming) I'm not sure if it's the latest dance remix or if the track is skipping. I hear more gun shots. Closer now, just outside the restroom. Then the door opens with a thud. I pull my feet up off the ground and onto the toilet seat. Curl myself into a ball, trying to make myself as small as possible, hoping that I will disappear. The gunman is in the restroom now. I hear a high pitched squeal, then a deafening gunshot, and then silence. Then the gunman speaks. "Every last one of them." I recognize my father's voice immediately. I hear his boots walk up to my stall and stop. He speaks again, louder this time, "Every last one of them!" He tries to open the door. The lock holds but just barely. There's no way out. I take a deep breath. I plant my feet on the ground and sit up straight. I wipe the tears off my cheeks with the sleeve of my t-shirt. He tries opening the door again, shaking it violently, grabbing it from above, and shaking it. Miraculously the lock holds. His voice is angry now, shouting, "Every last one of them!" I look at the door, and I am ready. He kicks it, and it swings open. He is in the stall now. He sees me, recognizes me. I see his mouth tremble ever so slightly. I smile at him. Tears are streaming down my face now. His face hardens, as he puts the barrel of the gun to my forehead. And he says in a soft, low voice, "Every last one of them." He pulls the trigger, and the gun clicks. He is out of bullets. He looks at me, as if he's coming out of a daze, and he smiles. Right then, just as I'm about to comprehend that smile, to understand the man behind it, the other bullets come. The police have finally arrived. Hundreds of bullets scatter my father all across that bathroom. My father's final words, "Every last one of them." (light music) - Hey. - Hey. - Come here. I really liked your piece. You know, your performance or whatever. - Thanks. - So. Is it all true? - Yeah. - Oh, really? That's intense. So, I'm a painting major, and I would love to paint you. (chuckles) - Okay. - I'm Slade, by the way. - I know who you are. - Really? - [Tarik] We're in the same class. - Oh, yeah, sorry. So, would you like to get a coffee or something? - You already have a coffee. - I can get another one. - I'm actually waiting for someone, so. - Oh, okay. - I can't. He's not really someone, you know? He's just my roommate. - Oh, good. (funky music) Well, congratulations, again, on the piece. - Thanks. - [Slade] I guess I'll see you around. (funky music) - [Tarik] Hi! - Hey. - Thank you. - What was that all about? - [Tarik] What was what all about? - Slade? - Well, he really liked my piece. - Oh, yeah? (laughing) How did your performance spoken word thing go? - Not great, but Slade really liked it. - Well, that's something, I guess. - I think he was just coming on to me. - Well, he must have really liked it then. - Since when is he gay? - Oh, he just doesn't believe in labels. He's an equal opportunity opportunist. What kind of a name is Slade, anyway? I mean, who or what does he think he is? Painting majors can be so pretentious. I hate them. We hate them. Don't we? - Yes. (light music) - Well, this is it. - Wow, it's huge. - Really, you think so? - You should see my place in London, it's half the size. - Yeah, well, you have the money? - Yes, of course. Okay, here it is. - Great. Well, it's all yours. Make yourself at home. And be careful with the toilet. It's a bit wobbly. And the shower is either scalding hot or freezing. The gas was shut off, we had a leak, but at least you won't blow up. (laughing) - Okay, anything else? - No, I think that's about it. Yeah, I think that's it, okay. Oh! - Keys? - Oh! (laughing) How could I forget that? - Thank you! - Yeah, I am DJing tonight, around the corner at The Cock on 2nd Avenue. Stop by, and I'll buy you a drink. - Oh, sounds fun, thanks. - Bye! - [Harry] Okay, I'll see you later, I'll come. Okay, goodnight, bye. (snaps fingers) (light music) (techno club music) (door clicking) - [Tarik] Great place. - [Harry] Thanks. (smooching) - Can I use your bathroom? - Sure. It's over there. (rustling) (sighs) - One, two, three. (clanking) 51, 52. 59. (exhales) (snaps fingers) (rustling) (groaning) (sighs) (phone ringing) (grunts) (deep breathing) (eerie music) (water running) (window scraping) Don't give me that look. (eerie music) (grunts) Good morning! You were amazing last night. - I was? - Oh, yeah. - Thank you. - Sorry, I have to run. - [Harry] Wait, can't you stay, have some breakfast or something? - No, sorry, I'm running late for work, but I'll see you. - Bye! Wait, what's your name? Amazing. (light funky beat music) (phone ringing) (grunting) Hello? Yes, I'm fine. (laughing) Everything's fine. Oh, the place is brilliant. It's very quiet and cozy. The hostess is very friendly and accommodating. It's New York, so everything is a little rough around the edges but in a charming way. Oh and I met someone last night. (laughing) Yes. I know. Oh, don't say that. Yes, my first night in New York, and I've already shagged someone. I don't want to brag or anything, but apparently I was incredible. Unfortunately I had quite a bit to drink, so I don't actually remember any of it. I went through quite a bit of cash last night. Don't say that, you're terrible. (laughing) I suppose things must be awfully expensive here. (funky music) You really are a nasty bitch, you know that? Yes, you are, that's why I love you, darling. Oh, don't say that. I miss you too, bye. (funky music) (whispering) (sighs) (shouting) Son of a bitch! (funky music) - What's up with him? - He's working on getting us a place to crash tonight. - We're in! (punk music) (knocking) - Hi, how are you? - Hey, nice to see you. - Welcome to my abode. Who are you? - I'm in your class, douche bag. - Nice to meet you, douche bag. Who are you, beautiful?

I draw and paint in my spare time. - What kind of things do you like to paint? - It's kind of abstract, dark, moody. I call it confrontational art. - I like confrontation. Yeah.

How was your stay? - Great, interesting. I lost all my credit cards, and most of my cash is missing, and I think I may have been inadvertently involved in sort of human trafficking or smuggling operation. - Oh, wow, sounds interesting. (zipping) Mind if I make some coffee? - Sure, go ahead, it's your home. I hope I can get on my plane, and I'm not on some sort of watch list. - Uh-huh. - it's been crazy. - Well, I'm glad you had a good time. - You Americans are all insane. No offense. - None taken. Oh, can you please remember to give me a good review, and I'll give you one? - [Harry] Yes, of course. - Great. (cup clanking) - [Harry] Here are the keys. - [Sparkle] Well, I hope you have a safe flight. - [Harry] Thanks, if I'm actually allowed to get on the plane, that is.

(slurps) (phone dinging) (funky music) (phone ringing) (footsteps pattering) Here's to surviving another month. (mugs clinking) (eerie music) (knocking) Hi, you must be Martin. - Yes. - Come in, come in. I'm Sparkle, welcome to New York. Do you have the money? - Yes, of course. (chuckles) - Great, thanks. Here's the bedroom. The kitchen, and there's the bathroom. - It's tiny, huh? - Well, that's New York for you. There's the keys. And this is the wifi code. We use the bar's, so it can be a bit sporadic, but it's really fast when it's on. - Okay. - Oh, and this is super important. You have to wear this when you're entering and leaving the apartment. They've installed security cameras. They're watching us, making sure that no one's Share B&Bing. They've threatened to evict anyone who is, so we just have to use a little caution. - Okay, I understand. - Great, here's an extra one, just in case you... Get lucky. (snickers) Oh, you don't have to wear it inside of the apartment. - I know, I'm just trying it on. - [Sparkle] Okay, great, thanks. Can I get you a coffee? - No, thanks. - How about a beer? - No, it's a little early for me. - Okay, well, they're in the fridge. Help yourself later. And speaking of later, I'm DJing at a club around the corner. I can put your name on the guest list, and get you some drinks, if you like. There should be some cute boys there. - Okay, sure. - Great.

We still have some time left on the old lease, don't we? - Three months. - [Eddie] Three months! See, that's some time.

And he told the department head. And he told my parents. (scoffs) - Shit. - Yeah. They're not gonna pay for my tuition anymore. So I'm dropping out of school. And I'm gonna move home to New Jersey. Go to community college there and work for my dad. - [Eddie] What? That's crazy. You don't have to move out! We'll figure something out. - It's finished. We're finished. - Don't. I'm sorry.

(funky music) - Come on, get up now. - Leave me alone. - [Sparkle] You've been moping around this bed for days, and I'm sick of it! - I don't feel good. - Well, that's too goddamn bad. You're coming to my show tonight, and that's final. (grunts) - Okay! Okay, I'm up. - Good. Now get dressed and help me with my makeup. Sex is simple. It has a definite beginning, middle, and end. And love is something else. It sneaks up on you. Takes control of you. And once you're lulled into its complacency, it starts slipping away. You try to take it back, but it's too late. That's when the fights start happening. And the bitterness and the resentment. It's best to just let it go. Enjoy it, cherish it while it lasts. But when it's over, let it be over. - You have no heart. - Oh, I have a heart. And believe me, I feel pain just as much as you do. But the heart will heal itself, if you let it. - It's not that easy. - Yes, it is. (sighs) - Okay. Where's your lighter? - It's in my purse. (opera singing) (applause) (rustling) (bird flailing) (sirens blaring in distance) - Everything is for sale now. Or rather, on loan. You don't own anything anymore. Everything is shared. If you have home or an apartment, you share it with strangers to pay your rent. You become a hotel, a maid, a servant in your own home. You think about your guests and what they would like, not what you want. You don't matter. You fade into the background. You worry about reviews and how many likes you get. If you have a car you share that, you drive drunk rich idiots around to pay for it. The insurance, the gas, the upkeep. You provide water and mints and worry about your score. Just one click away from losing everything. If you have anything, you sell it on Ebay to pay your credit card, internet, and phone bills, making sure you get it out on time and in the right condition. You must stay above average, above 90%. It's a full time, 24/7 job. Buying and selling and renting and sharing and branding and rating and posting and liking and reviewing and loading and unloading and shipping and receiving and building and growing and on and on and on. If you have a decent body, you let people see it, use it, abuse it, dismiss it, play with it, destroy it, so you can pay your gym membership, doctor, your dentist, and plastic surgeon to fix it so that you can continue to have the decent body. You sell your eggs to pay off creditors. You sell your sperm to help your credit score. You've given too much blood, they won't take any more. You sell whatever organs you can spare to pay your water, gas, and electric bill. How much liver do you need really? How many kidneys? Lungs? Eyes? Legs? Arms? Do you really need a heart? You just keep selling things until one day you have nothing and are nothing. You simply disappear. At least you don't have to worry about funeral and burial cost. (sighs) (rustling) - Is this the last of it? - Yeah, that's it. (door clicking) I'm gonna miss you. - Don't miss me, remember me. - We had some good times. - Yeah, we did, didn't we? - You sure you don't need help packing or clearing the place out? - No, I think I'm just gonna throw most of it out or I'm gonna let the landlord deal with it. I don't need any of this crap. - You take care of yourself. - You too. (funky music) - Sorry, didn't mean to scare you. - [Sparkle] No, you're fine. - Have you decided where you're going? - South, like the birds. Maybe Florida or Mexico, Honduras, or Brazil. Maybe even the South Pole. - It's cold down there. - Yeah, I'll be alright. Your girlfriend got another client over? - No. She left me. I'm just smoking out here, out of habit. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Don't be. It's for the best. Hey, do you want to come up to my place for...
