[Ukrainian] The mighty Dnieper roars and groans An angry wind howls Bending willows to the ground Blowing water mountain-high Hey, it's the Jew-girl Chava! I'm crazy about her! -My heart aches for you, Jew-girl! -Mine too! You devil! You have no heart You don't know what love is! Thanks! Khvedka! What are you doing? Mama will see. Why are you afraid, darling? When you're really in love, you don't have to hide. That's enough feeding geese, you gosling! I brought you a present. Gorky. Maxim Gorky. You know you look like Gorky? You're so beautiful, like the dreamy skies over our Malorossiya. You speak so beautifully now, like in the books. Why the strange laugh? I'm happy, so I laugh. I'm not sad in the daytime. You'll never be sad with me. You're my sunlight, my life. Or you I'd go. -In fire, in water. Like in the books. Come, my precious. My heart is pounding. That looks like Mama. Who is that? My heart skipped a beat! Tseytl! Tseytl, you think I didn't know you were coming? God bless me! I heard it in a dream last night! May I hear the Messiah like that! Shloyme! Pearl! Sweet grandchildren! Came to visit Grandma. Don't stand here, you must be hungry. Come, children. Where's Papa? I've missed him so. In Boyberik, selling. He'll be home soon. How's your husband? How should he be? He coughs. He does? There's a remedy. Sage with chaff, boiled sour-milk, and a wool sock around his neck at night. It works. Come to the table, children. Nu, how long is your Sabbath? Giddy-up! Giddy-up! Oh, God, what to do? Giddy-up! Gone deaf in your old age, eh? Pretending not to hear... What's it gonna be? "Condemn me not to decrepitude," means you too Nu! You stubborn... Oh, God. So what's the story? Won' listen to me, eh? So you're playing deaf. Well, here's your next world now! Take that! What's to be done? We're utterly lost! What can we do? A wagon! -A wagon! -He's coming this way! Sir! Here! Here! Can you direct us to Boyberik, kind sir? Calm yourself, we're not demons. Look, this is Tevye the dairyman! Listen, Mr. Tevye. We're ladies from Yehupets. We have a summer home nearby. We went for a walk and got lost. Which way is Boyberik? The way to Boyberik? Just stay straight on this road and you'll get there, you can't miss it. It's not far, maybe two or three miles. Two or three miles! My goodness! That would take till midnight! And we haven't eaten today. Maybe you'll take us? We'll pay you. You'll have to ask him. He's a difficult person Use the whip! He's as accustomed to the whip as I am to poverty. Well, climb on, maybe he'll have more respect for you. Climb up. Enjoy, children. Don't be shy, Tseytl, you're home. Thanks, Mama. I'll wait for Papa. How's Chava? She worries me, your sister. Did something happen? Nothing that's good. You know that gentile, Khvedka Galagan? -Yes, so? -So they're very friendly. How so? She borrows books from him. And they stand at the gate talking for hours. God, what are they talking about so long? And I myself heard... May I hear good things for Jews! And saw... May I live to see Rachel's Tomb! How they greeted each other! That's all? What, they should hug and kiss? The wind blows, the rain falls If you want a girl like me Then you'll have to walk me home Chava! Mama, don't tell her! Children! It's Aunt Chava! If you want a girl like me Then you'll have to walk me home Chava! Tseytl! Look at you! Like a beauty! A beauty! -Aunt Chava! -Shloyme! Pearl! What brought you here? She missed her mother, $0 she hired a wagon and came. Mama dreamed that the cow and the cat both gave birth. You laugh at the whole world. Just like your father. And here's the emperor himself. Don't say anything. Papa, dear. Papa himself. Like the Torah says, "Thusly, even the Devil won't take him." How are you? How's your breadwinner? Probably sits all day “at scripture and worship” sewing underpants. And how are the children? Grandpa! My treasures! How are you? Shloyme. Grandchildren, my darlings! Little dairy treats! I brought you a present, Chava. -A book. -A book! Thank you, Papa. Books, shmooks. What for? We talked about this. You don't mix in my business. Like it's written... "Mine art thine, thine art mine." Let's go eat. You must be hungry. You're right. Like it's written, "No flour, no Torah." "If you eat flea bites, you won't know fly specks." You go to the table. We'll do the ritual hand washing. What's doing, Grandson? My lamb. (makes blessing) You need the book now? Papa, we agreed you wouldn't mix in my business. Like it's written, "Mine and thine, and thine, thine." Spoken like a true ignoramus. But you do know the grammar. Never mix in someone else's business. For example, if I mixed in with Mama's borscht? Crazy man! The borscht waits, and he sings! You hear? The sages were right. A hundred-pound Jewess has two tons of talk. We're discussing books. She's discussing borscht. Eat already. -Well, that's rotten luck. -What? The priest's here again. It is him. What a guest! Greetings, Father! Greetings, Tevel! What is this? That prize package keeps dropping by. Welcome, Father. Quite a guest! How are you? Like some snuff? I'm heading to town, and I thought I'd see how things are at Tevel's place. Looks fine. Come, catch your breath. Drink some sour-milk. Come, Father. Careful, now. What a guest! They're thick as thieves. -You're a very welcome guest, Father. -Thank you You have lovely daughters. But why should they suffer for their parents' transgressions? You marry them off to plain Jews. You cut off their braids and they're done, both for this world and the next. You know what? About this world, let me worry, and about the next world, same thing. Tell me some news instead. I have plenty of news for you. That's what I want. They're having a conference. Golde! Look what a guest I'm bringing! A surprise guest. Greetings, miss. Greetings. Make yourself comfortable, Father. Have some sour-milk. Fresh and cold. Thank you, no. Now, let's hear some news. Fresh news. You want news? All right. You know Mendel Verebivker has a daughter. That's news? Mendel Verebivker has a daughter? Mendel Verebivker has a daughter! Mendel Verebivker, God help him, has seven daughters. Daughters, as it's written, "The children romped.” They grew. That's what daughters do, eat by day and grow by night. This Mendel Verebivker's daughter fell in love with Anton, the forester's son. And he's marrying her. Her poor mother! You don't sit idle, Father. You catch some fish from us. Like it says, “In a lonely place." If there's no real fish, you eat a sardine. This is no joke, Tevel. It is a serious matter. She has entered our dominion. What does that mean? You're a smart Jew, Tevel. What if your daughter, for example, wanted to marry one of ours? You want to hear my answer. I'll make it short. Listen. If something like that happened with me, the end would be... Either I wouldn't survive, or she'd die, or both of us. Like it's written, "Perish with the Philistines." And if Tevye had ten daughters, they all would die. And if one of them... Chava! Father? My God! Come to me, Chava. Daughter! Are you all right? All right. I know she's all right. Women! Always an uproar! "Chava! Save her!" There's no fire! Oh, you women, no wonder King Solomon couldn't stand you. Oh, dear, still fainting? Come inside, come. You'll lie down. "Oy, she fainted, help, help!" Grandpa, take us to Boyberik. You want to go to Boyberik, princess? Come on. Giddy-up! Chava! -Chava! -Why are you following me? Chava, I've been here long enough to see. I know what's going on. So does Mama. If Papa found out, it'd be a disaster. Why are you torturing me? Listen to me. We're sisters, from the same parents. But if something like that should happen. I'd rather not live to see it. Why are there these differences between people, between beliefs? Wicked people created these differences. But we should keep ourselves above all beliefs. Because you are my belief. When I don't see you, I miss you so. And when I see you, I want to break it off and run. It would destroy my parents. You worry more about your father than about me. There's no father like him. I'm lost. I'm lost. Why lost, precious? Nobody loves you like I do. We must be strong, angel. I was at Father Alexei's today, and I promised we'd be there tomorrow. “Angel Throw me in the river and drown me and end it all. My poor frightened dove... I brought the other Gorky book I promised you. Thanks. Let's take a walk. I've been waiting to see you all day. -It's late! -Come, angel. Khvedka, Father's coming out of the stable. Go! Chava? Yes, Papa. Chava. Who jumped off the porch? I'd swear it was a person. Yes, a person. A person? If I'm not mistaken, it was Khvedka Galagan. Was he here? Yes. -What did that prize package want? -Nothing. We talked. He brought me a book. A book? He brings you books? Listen. We haven't had a talk in a while. But now I see we have to. Sit So he brings you books. Let's see. Books are important. From books you learn about the whole world, both above and down here. One thing I don't understand. For books, you can meet in the house. Why jump off porches like a savage? Is this one of those books you have to hide in the attic? It's perfectly legal. It's by Gorky. Who's Gorky? A Russian writer. He's another Tolstoy. Who? Count Tolstoy, whose portrait hangs on my wall. The same Tolstoy who says that if they slap your cheek, you should say "Good job” and offer them the other cheek? Oh, that Tolstoy. And this Maxim, what's his name, "Gorker"? Gorky's a great man, Papa. Simple, but great. Really. Here's his picture. That's him. A great man. He looks very familiar. I'd swear I'd seen him somewhere. -Where? -I'm not sure. I think it was either by the train carrying luggage, or in the forest chopping wood. There's something I don't understand. Why is Tevye's daughter spending time with that roughneck? Why talk like that? Do you know him? What then is he, the Great Rabbi's grandson? Khvedka, Scion of Lord Mikita Galagan! What an ancestry! His grandfather Terenti was an unbelievable drunk who beat his wife three times a week. And his great-grandfather spent his life slopping hogs and peeling potatoes. What an ancestry! You yourself said there is one God over everyone, so therefore... That's true. To God we're the same. All Israel has a share In the world to come That means Jews and gentiles are equal. But this you know, The Holy Torah commands us to love all peoples. But Amalek, who tormented us, we must never forget. Right? Why are you saying that? Why? Take the magistrate and the village elder. They're our friends, right? But if a “celebration” breaks out, I mean a pogrom, they'd also throw rocks at us. That's why. I don't believe it You don't. Well... Go to sleep. -Good night. -Good night, Papa. Yes, Papa? What would happen, for example, if something you did might end your parents lives? Would you do it? Tell me. No, Papa. No? So why are we talking, silly? Who needs to talk? I didn't ask, and you didn't answer. Like the Torah says, "And forgotten!" We're just like we always were. My wonderful daughter! Golde! Listen! Look, angel! The whole village came to celebrate our wedding! I can't see anyone. Probably dust in my eyes. Or maybe they hid her upstairs some place. Oh, God, to have lived to... Tevye, be careful how you talk to him. If you start in with your quotes, we'll be lost. Be gentle. Don't shout. Should I dance? He took away the most precious thing I have. Should I be silent? Sorry. Father! Father, you have company! -Sorry. -Tevel! An honored guest. Since you're here, we'll have tea. Put the samovar on the porch. Now we'll drink tea together. Nice, eh? A dear guest. Come, we'll have tea. Sit down. Sit, missus. Relax, Tevel. Feel like you're at home. We'll have tea soon. No, Father. I'm not here to sit or drink tea. I came to ask some questions. Please answer me straight, without evasions. Remember the story about the rich man stealing the poor man's lamb? I remember. You do? So do you know that my child is in your house? My lamb! I want my child back! I-- -Tevye, be careful! -Don't worry. I want my child, Father! My Chava! Chava! Daughter! Let me go, Khvedka! Darling, my soul... Khvedka, let me go! I hear my father's voice. He's calling me. "Chava," he cries out, "Chava!" You dare speak to me that way? Do you know who you stand before? You stand before the Tear's servant! The protector of the Holy Church! Darling, you've cried too much today. You should rest before the ceremony. Come, sit. That's right, my dove. Hush, my love. Father. Have pity. Look. Have pity. I'm begging you, Father. Father, dear. Degrading yourself that way before a human being. You're right. If you're talking about humans, humanity, tell me, Father, do I have any hope of getting my child back? Of course. But later. Not later, Father, now. I want to see my child this minute! You're not going inside. - I will! I'm going, I said! -You can't You shall not. Chava, my daughter! Help, somebody! Get out of here, you... Papa, Mama... Did you hear how he spoke? Fine words. Fine words. Let's go. Where? We'll go where we'll go. -Thank you for coming to my son's wedding. -Thank you! All the neighbors are coming to our disaster. Oh, God. Mikita, we've always been good neighbors. Please, have pity. My Chava's inside. I want to see her for one minute. Please, I'm begging you. I won't do anything to her or to your son. Please. How should I know where your daughter is? Leave me alone, you stubborn— You know, Mikita. You're going to the priest, to my destruction. I'm begging you. I'll give you my last shirt, my coat. Shove off, pest! Kolina, dear, you're a mother yourself. Shove off! Disgusting pest! It's impossible to get rid of you! I can't stand them! So how do you like our in-laws? Wonderful in-laws. In-laws. Look, Tevel came to his daughter's wedding. Tevel and his wife. It's a pity. Khvedka didn't need their daughter. There's plenty of gentile girls here. Why crawl after the Jew-girls? Right, Magistrate. There's plenty of gentile girls. Why crawl to the Jews? God! Let's go. Let's go. That ceremony with the priest, those insane oaths, disowning my parents. It's a lie. You can't disown your parents. Not even for me? For my love, that's stronger than anything? Angel, my dove... Here's the bride and groom. Congratulations. Children, enough! The priest said it's time to go to the church. Everyone's waiting in the church. -Come, dear. -Come, sweet girl May you be happy. Losing a child. How do you live with the pain? The disgrace? It's late. It's time to recite the end-of-Sabbath prayer. God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob Protect your people, Israel, from evil The holy Sabbath is leaving May the new week bring health Sustenance, deliverance and solace For all Israel, amen Mama. Tseytl, daughter. Hush, Mama. Where's Papa? Going around in a daze to the constable, to the elder, to the priest. Lost. It's hopeless. He stands near the church and watches his undoing. Chava! Chava, what have you done? Enough, Mama. Papa's coming. Very nice, Tevye. Very nice. What you get from raising children. You old fool, where were your eyes, where was your sense? What do you say, Golde? What is there to be said? When she was here, we could hope, we could trust in God. Now it's over. But you can't be angry at God. You can't spite God. Sabbath is ending. We have to make the blessing. It's too late for the ritual meal. God will forgive us. I recited the evening prayers, not well. I'll make the blessing on this. Here is my God I shall believe and not fear God is my strength and my song And will be my salvation I joyously draw water From the wells of salvation Salvation is God's May you bless your people The Lord of Hosts is with us The God of Jacob is our stronghold Happy is he who believes in you Lord of Hosts Save us, God God will answer on the day we call The Jews had light and joy, happiness and honor, may we have the same I will raise the cup of salvation And calf out in God's name With common consent Blessed art thou, Lord our God Master of the world That all will be at his word Blessed art thou, Lord our God Master of the world Creator of the light of flame Blessed art thou, Lord our God Master of the world Who differentiates between sacred and ordinary, light and darkness Israel and other nations, the seventh day And the six days of work Blessed art thou, God Who differentiates Between sacred and ordinary A good week. A good week. Well... So settled up with God. He gave me mine, I gave him his. We're even. Now we can go about our business. Like the Torah says, "Human work." Chava is dead. Chava is dead. "God giveth, God taketh." We're required to say, "Blessed is the true judge". Now you can cry. But not Tevye. Tevye is not an old Jewish woman. Now we sit shiva. But not more than one hour. Not more than one hour. Sit, cry it out, and forget. Like the Torah says, "And forgotten." Like a dead person. I shouldn't say dead. When someone dies, you say the memorial prayer. You mark the anniversary. It's a commandment! But with Chava it's "neither mention nor remember." Such children should not be remembered. Not fondly, not harshly. "Not mentioned." You hear? The name Chava must never be spoken. You hear? Dead. Never existed. God. God, where are you? Where are you? [Ukrainian] I tell you, Magistrate, this is a matter for the sheriff. Not the sheriff! But the council That's enough! He goes on for days, you can lose your mind. Say the council- -Nonsense! It's not the council, the administrator did- Stop scratching that thing! Eat and stop playing. I'm telling you the council knows what it's doing, period! Cut it out! Zozulya, is it true the council's evicting Tevel from the village? It's true. They are. That's a disgusting thing for the council to do! Tevel is a good neighbor and an honorable man Right, Elder? Right, a good man, even if he's a Jew. Shame on the council! Don't talk about the council! I was on the council for 35 years! Show some respect! You can, all of you, be sent to Siberia for speaking against the council! To hell with the council! If they evict Tevel from the village, it'll be your and your son's fault! We know you, Mikita Galagan, you cheap phony, and your son Khvedka too! My Khvedka's fingernail is worth more than you and your elder! You nothing! You garbage! I paid for my liquor. You get drunk and you don't pay! You lowlife! You pig's toilet! You're starting in— How's your mother? Very sick. They say the doctor came from the city. I'll go with you. I'll see who keeps you from seeing her before she dies. She'd die sooner if she saw me. She was always healthy, my mother. She's leaving this world because of me. (reciting Psalms for the Sick) Mama, have some milk. Papa. God... Shloyme, do you cry about Grandma, "Bless his memory"? You say that for Father. For Grandma it's "Bless her memory." Well, do you cry about her? You're a pest! Drop the cat. If you play with cats, you lose your memory. Why? Because cats have no memories. Why not? Because you're a pest! What's this? What's going on here, a war? You're impossible! Get inside! They're impossible. Do me a favor, go into the cellar and bring up cheese and sour cream and the produce. I'm going into Boyberik. -Right away. -Thank you, Tseytl. It's hot! Like fire. Hot borscht cools your insides. It's good for the heart. Enough serving. Eat, Yeva. Haven't you worked enough already? You've worn her out with all this serving. Am I her mother-in-law or is she mine? Eat, and that's all. Papa! Enough nonsense. A Jew has to study, you hear? You'll have to go into town soon and say a memorial prayer for your father like a person, like a Jew, you hear? Psalms are good too. Try. I do. But they won't stick in my head. "They don't stick!" Don't worry, they will. I want to learn too. Bless you! She wants to learn too. That's it Now listen to how we say Psalms. A Psalm Of David Bless you! She's listening. She wants to learn. But Psalms are not for women. Men have to know Psalms. He needs to. A Psalm Of David The Lord Is my shepherd I shall not want Good, now say it like this. A Psalm of David The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want Your rod And your staff Good boy. You can learn! Once again. A Psalm of David The Lord is my shepherd A Psalm of David The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want Just like that. Greetings, Tevel. Bless you. The whole council. What's the good word? What's happening in the world? Come in, make yourself at home. We came to tell you you're being evicted from the village. -It's the council. -The council wants it. Evicted from the village? In the 50-odd years I lived with you, I never stole, or cheated, or hurt anyone. The Tsar has decreed that all Jews must be evicted from the villages. -Right, Elder? Right, from all the villages. And if all the gentiles in the villages cut off their noses, you'd do it too? That's silly. For my part, you could stay. Even die here. -Right, Elder? -Absolutely, die here. Well, for dying, you're preferable. You're gentiles with positions, with badges. They'd bury you with parades. I'm a poor Jew. They'd have to take me to the city and find a Jewish cemetery. No, I have to live. God blessed me in my old age with fatherless grandchildren. What will I do about them? I'll have to go begging. The constable and the notary are here! So? Like it's written, "Haman arriveth." The devil sent them. Tevel! Go away! Tevel. In 24 hours, you must leave the village. Understood? What's hard to understand? This great wisdom? You give me 24 hours to catch my breath, sell our belongings, pack up our rags and leave the sacred village for wherever our sinful feet take us. Stop babbling! Zozulya! Read the verdict and he'll sign it. Idiot! [Russian] "As per the decree of His Imperial Highness'-- Stop, stop. It's perfectly clear. The council informs me that I'm being dispossessed. Why all the fuss? You can say it in three words, "So sorry, Tevye." Stop babbling! It will be signed. Period. Watch. I'm signing. Oh, God... How are you writing? You dip the pen, like this, and... Idiot! Oh, their alphabet... Come. Idiots! It's not our fault. The council. The council. It's not our fault. What will we do? Stop crying. You're bawling like it's Yom Kippur. Why are you crying? This never happened before? When were we not chased out? Where? It's what they do. Stop crying. That's enough. Listen, Grandson. When you study Torah, you'll learn how God went to our great-grandfather Abraham and said... "Get thee gone," he said, "From your land, excuse me, to the land I show you." See? In 24 hours. 24 hours. Tseytl. Please pack up the small things. I'll go sell the livestock, the furniture, and everything else. We'll close it when we leave their sacred village where our sinful feet dare not tread. That's enough crying. Where will we go? In a forest with animals. It's better than being among them. Did you see the magistrate and the elder? Our good friends. Our good friends. Where's my whip? Here it is. Like it's written, "With my staff I crossed the Jordan." You came with the whip, you go with the whip Tseytl, take the pictures down. We'll pack them in the cases and... take them with us. Tseytl, take the... Pack all the things. [Ukrainian] What's going on, Father? What did you hear? It's sad about Tevel. An intelligent man, but stubborn. He could have been our head, if he'd convert. More than once I tried to enlighten him, but he's stubborn. It's a pity. Poor Tevel. (bargaining) A good man, Tevel. He's selling everything for pennies. If he didn't sell cheap, we'd just take it How much for him? Come on, already! Well, brother, we have to part. You've been a dear, true friend. For years we dragged through mud, frost, storms... but now I must give you to a stranger. Forgive me. What I can do? They're teaching me about "Get thee gone." Look how he looks at me with those eyes. Go justify yourself to a horse. Here's the money. No, brother, I can't sell you the horse. I'll sell you the house, the wagon, whatever you want, but this horse, I can't. Then why drive me crazy like that? Sad about Tevel. A nice kike. He lived with us so long. Sad. I paid him for everything I bought. I only stole this. Oh, and I took his dead wife's Sabbath petticoat. Give it here, you tramp! You're not married! I can use it. Too bad I'm not married. It's a beautiful petticoat. No woman could stand you. If knew you'd take the petticoat, I wouldn't have bothered to steal it. You shouldn't have stolen it. She was a nice woman. True, true a nice woman. To a poor peasant she'd give milk, cheese, some borscht. She was a kind woman. It's sad about them. We're going to the land of Israel. Why Israel, Papa? Where else, America? What will I do there in my old age? I don't know their language and they don't know mine. That leaves Argentina, Palestine, or the land of Israel. Then I'll see the Tomb of the Patriarchs, and Rachel's Tomb, and Mount Sinai, and Piden-Aram, and Pithom and Ramses... A Bible set... A prayer-book, a year-round one. The Penitence Prayers. Sacred Dirges. And who's this rascal? Grace After Meals. You're traveling too. This is the whole inheritance we bring from exile to Israel. Mama, come outside. Papa might come out. Here. Tseytl, my sister, I just heard you're being evicted from here. Mama's Sabbath dress. I took it from them and ran. I've missed you all so much. Papa. Mama. I went to her grave several times. Fasted every Yom Kippur. My body was there, but my soul was with you. A nightmare. I don't know how I got through it Khvedka's coming. Let him. Nobody can take me from my father's house again. I understand everything. But is it my fault? I've never wronged you. love you. You're a good man. That's why I'm begging you to let me go. I don't have the strength to keep pining like this. Have pity. Chava, Papa's coming out. Go home. And don't be angry. I will always think of you fondly. You see, it's impossible. We're from different worlds. Papa, it's all packed. We're taking everything, except for a person that we're abandoning. What are you ranting about? Did you forget you have another daughter? I have no other daughters. I have no other daughters! Do you hear me? I have no others! I have no other daughters! -Don't, Grandpa! -Don't be mean to Mama! Mama's annoying me. I have no other daughters. I do not have any! None. Papa. When she heard what they're doing, she came back to us. She said, "Where we go, she goes." She's been to Mama's grave. She fasts on Yom Kippur. What are you talking about? Grandpa! It's Aunt Chava! Is this a dream? Am I Tevye? Temper... Let me out! May I and my children die if you chase her away! Have compassion, Papa. Compassion? Where was her compassion when your mother was here lying under a black cloth? You yourself said it's written in... you know... that God feels compassion even for worms. Who knows that better than you? It's because I know that I say in this case there's no regret and no repenting. If you desert us, you do not return. The twig torn from the tree must wither. The leaf that falls dries out. I wasn't torn, Papa. Nothing the priest said touched my soul. My soul is not stained. You converted! Get out of here! Papa, have pity. I didn't convert. I missed you and thought about you constantly. I thought everything of theirs was better, prettier than ours I was wrong. Your old belief is truer, deeper. Now, finally, I know. I understand. Papa, I want to come home. My soul belongs to you. Where you are, I am. Your life is my life. Your pain is my pain. Our life is her life and our pain is her pain. God, it's just us like in the Book of Esther. No, not Esther, Ecclesiastes, I think... "My nation is your nation." Our God is her God. Beautiful words. That's how Tevye's daughters should speak. Tevye's daughters. God, God, God. There's only one thing I'd wish for that the constable could hear her words, and be broken by them. Grandpa. Maybe I should close my eyes... then open them and say, "Thou art forgiven." But it's hard. Where is God? Have I sinned so terribly? Sinned... On the other hand, do I have to take up God's case? I don't know. God, what should I do? You yourself wrote, "As a father hath mercy on children..." A father with a heart, a soul... God. What do you say? I don't know.
