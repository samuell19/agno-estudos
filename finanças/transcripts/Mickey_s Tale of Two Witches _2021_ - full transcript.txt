The contest is to see who is the kookiest and spookiest ghoul, ghost, or goblin in Happy Haunt Hills. So let's deliver those invitations and get the word out! We're on it! Now hurry back so you can start your tests! And if either one of you doesn't graduate to be a full-fledged witch, [gulps] there's always next Halloween! Yes, Witch Master Clarabelle. Oh! I hope I graduate! Don't worry, Daisy Doozy! You will. We will! [giggles] - [meows] - Hop on, Figaro! You too, Spooky Loca. Okay, but watch the speeeed...! Oh! Ooh! [chuckles] [squeaking] Now fly! Fly, my pretties! Fly! [laughs] [bats squeak] Wow! Spooky-rific! [chuckling] Ooh! The Boo Bash! I gotta tell Butch and Bony. Oh, what a Witchy-rific day! Aren't you excited, Daisy? I was, until Witch Master Clarabelle said one of us might not graduate! Maybe I'm not good enough to be a real witch. I... I'm not sure I can do this, Minnie. Oh, Daisy Doozy, I believe in you! We'll be real witches together! Just like we've always wanted. Oh, I hope you're right! - [ghost chuckles] - [gasps] [chuckling] Look! It's Count Mickula and the boys! - Hi, Count Mickula! - Happy Halloween! - Mummy Donald... - Hiya! [growls] - Franken Goof... - Rawr! H'yuck. - Werewolfy Pluto... - [barks, howls] Hi, Junior Witches! How's the training going at the Academy? Today's our big Witchy Tests! And if we pass, we'll both get to be real witches! - Sounds swell! - [howls] Count Mickula! How's your new song coming along? We can't wait to hear it at the Boo Bash tonight! It wouldn't be Halloween without Count Mickula and the Monsters' big new song! I, um, don't have my new song yet! [all] You don't?! I'm having trouble coming up with the new song, but inspiration will strike soon... [chuckles] I... I hope. Well, in-spee-ration better make it snappy, 'cause when the Monster Clock strikes thirteen, it'll be time for every goblin and ghost to shake their "boo" -ties. H'yuck! Well, we'll see you later at the Boo Bash! We have to get back to the Witch Academy! To take our big tests! - [gulps] - [Count Mickula chuckles] I'll bet you'll both graduate tonight and become great witches! Let's hope Witch Master Clarabelle thinks so, too! [all] Good luck! And good luck coming up with your big Halloween song! [Pete the Ghost] Fa-boo-lous! Tonight's gonna be my lucky fright night, fellas! Look, Bony! Tonight's the big Halloween Kooky Spook Contest at the Boo Bash! [laughs] See? [sighs] - [whines] - Oh, Butchy boy! Now you remember that Kooky Spook Contest I lost last year? And the year before that? And the year before that? Well, you get the point. I guess I just wasn't kooky-spooky enough! [barks] Well tonight, I'm gonna win! You see, I come from a long line of winners! And for once in my afterlife, I'm gonna make my family proud! [barks] Oh, I won't lose. Because this year, I've been practicing my scary new moves! [laughs] Get a load of this! [spooky moan] Wa-waa. Well, I'm still working on it. Come on, Butch! Let's go sign up for that contest, because tonight, I'll be the spooky ghost with the most! Ooh... Whoa! Rats! Why can't I go through things like other ghosts?! [groans] Oh, I'll never remember these spells! Junior Witches, it's time for Witch test number one: Casting a Spell! Minnie the Wonderful, please step up to the cauldron. Now if you want to cast a spell, just concentrate and do it well! Stir the cauldron nice and light, for your spell to come out right! [meows] Bubbles, bubbles, now you rise. Give us all a big surprise, And conjure up some... butterflies! [popping] - Wow! - [meows] [gasps] It worked! [giggles] Very good, Minnie the Wonderful! Now it's your turn, Daisy Doozy! You've got this! Okay! Here it goes! I gotta do this, I just gotta! Bubbling cauldron, heed my powers! Make me a bouquet of pretty flowers! - Oh, dear! - Yiye! Oh, Daisy Doodles! Daisy Doozy, you passed this test... barely. Oh. Thank you. See, Daisy? You can do this! Bah-room! Okay, Junior Witches! Grab your Zoom-Brooms, because it's time for test number two: Witchy flying! - [gulps, whimpers] - Good luck, Minnie. You can do this! Oh! I hope so. Have lots of fun, girls! - [Daisy and Spooky Loca] Ahh! - Whoa! [groans] Junior Witches, I want you to do a kooky corkscrew roll! [both] We're on it! Whee-hee-hee! - [meows] - Whoa! [giggles] Well done! Now combine your kooky corkscrew roll with a witchy loopty-loop spooky swoop! Oh, okay. Here I go! Ahh! Whoa! Whoa!! [grunts] Hm. Her loopty-loop was a bit sloopy-sloppy, but her swoop was simply swoo-per! [chuckles] Your turn, Daisy! Got it! Ahh! [laughs] Whaa! - Whoa! - [Daisy laughs] [laughing] Good job, Daisy Doozy! Oh, you were terrific, Daisy Doozy! Thanks, Minnie! You did great, too! Now let's moo-ve on to test number three: Floatation Levitation! Follow me! "Floatation levitation"? Oh, no! That one's always been hard for me! Knowing you, Daisy, I bet you can do better than you think. Just try your best! Okay! ♪ You gotta chomp Chomp, chomp ♪ ♪ And do the Monster Stomp ♪ So, what do you guys think? Gawrsh! It sounds just like that song we played last year! It is the song we played last year! [whines] [sighs] You're right. We've got our stage set up, we've got our jack-o'-lantern, but we still need a song! Ahh! Whoo! [giggles] Uh-oh! Look at those boulders! Oh! They're blocking the road to the Boo Bowl! Which is why this is the perfect place for test number three: Floatation Levitation! Junior Witches, to pass this test, each of you must moo-ve one of these boulders up to the tippity-top of the mountain! - Dizzy doodles! - [Figaro cries] All the way up there? Exactly! Use your mind to concentrate, and you can make anything float and levitate! Okay! Giant boulder, feel my will! Float up to that big old hill! Please keep moving, do not stop! Until you reach the mountain top! You did it, Daisy! - Whoo-hoo! - [meows] - You're next! - You've got this, Minnie! Okay! Here I go! Giant boulder, before my eyes! Shrink down to a tiny size! Uh-oh! [meows] Now that is very clever... or as I like to say, "You're thinking outside the Cauldron!" [chuckles] We accidentally started an avalanche! [yowls] Oh, no! The boys are in trouble! Oh, no! That rock is heading towards Count Mickula and his band! What do you think they're gonna do now, Pluto? [whimpers] Let's keep reading and find out what happens! [barks, pants] I got this! Oh, gosh. I gotta come up with a big new song to really rock the crowd tonight! - [rumbling] - [all gasp] Yikes! Avalanche! [Pluto whimpers] - Whoa! - [barks] Tumbling rocks of stone and trouble! Leave my friends alone and turn into bubbles! - Wow! - Wow-wee! [cheering] Now that's what I call Halloween magic! And that's worthy of the highest grade you can get... a gold star! A gold star! Oh, congratulations, Minnie the Wonderful. Ooh! I have to find my own way to wow Witch Master Clarabelle and get my own gold star. Then you better ace the next test! It's the last one. And if you don't pass it, you won't graduate! I bet I could pass if I had a wand of my own... like Witch Master Clarabelle's. Yoo hoo! Witch Master Clarabelle! - Hi, Pete! - Hi, Minnie! Say, is it too late to sign up for the Kookity Spookity contest or what? [pants] What a moo-arvelous idea! Butch would be great in the contest. - [whimpers] - No! I want to be in the contest! - [giggling] - But, Pete, you're funny, not spooky! But I'm a ghost! I'm supposed to be spooky! Here! Watch this! Boo! Oof! Safety violation! [blows] - [all laugh] - Huh? - [laughter] - [Minnie] You're funny! But I can be spooky! - [laughs] - Keep workin' on it, Pete! [chuckles] You're the best ghost comedian ever, Pete! But I don't wanna be funny! I wanna be... [grunts] I wanna be spooky. Ooh, I'll show them. Let's go, Butch. Pete, we're sorry! We didn't mean to hurt your feelings! Well, fellas, we still need a new song, so let's get back to work! But what about our Jacky-Lantern? It got squarshed! Well, we'll find another one later. Now, Junior Witches, for your fourth and final test, I want you to spread the spooky spirit of Halloween all over Haunted Hills. For a witch, it's our number one job! Follow me! - [Minnie and Daisy] Whee! - [Mickey chuckles] [harmonica plays] [gruffs] Sorry Butch, but I don't feel like playin'. I've got me a bad case of the boo-hoo-blues. [barks] Yeah! How dare they say I'm not spooky! Boo! [gurgles] Aw, what do you know? You're just a fish... or somethin'. I can't let my ghostly family down!

A little bit of fright makes Halloween just right! [laughs] Boo-ya! That's it! See, if I had that Moo Wand, I could turn myself into somethin' spook-tacular! I'll swipe that wand tonight and show this entire town that I can be a spooky spirit! - Oh, yeah! - [barks] Come on, pal! Let's ghost. Junior Witches, for your final test, I'd like you to decorate Spooky Street any way you like, as long as it screams Halloween! Oh, I'll make some cute bat bows! And I'll put up lots of pumpkin lanterns. And you must be finished before the hourglass runs out. [both] One hour? But that's gonna be impossible! Where there's a witch, there's a way! Make it look spook-tacular and witchy-rific! After all, Halloween only comes once a year! [cackles] [sighs] I guess I'll decorate the right side of the street! Okay. I'll take the left side! Oh! If only we had our own magic wands! Then I could use mine to decorate. It'd be so much easier! Why are you so worried, Daisy? You've done decorating like this before... without a magic wand! But now my graduation depends on it! If I fail this test, I won't get to be a real witch with you! Then let's do our witchy best, and we'll both pass the test! Right, girlfriend? You got it, sister! Now! Let's give Spooky street a magical monster makeover! ♪ It's so magical Being witchy ♪ ♪ When you're getting A chance to shine ♪ ♪ I'm so nervous I'm getting twitchy ♪ ♪ Worried no wands Will be mine ♪ ♪ What delicious Bit of mischief ♪ ♪ Shall we pull From our pointy hats? ♪ ♪ All I feel Comes down to this ♪ ♪ The pressure's Gonna drive me bats ♪ ♪ But let's get on The spooky side ♪ ♪ Come on and Show off your spooky side ♪ ♪ String the lights To guard the frights ♪ ♪ And let your nightmares Be your guide ♪ ♪ Love these spooky-ical Transformations ♪ ♪ As you find these Thrills galore ♪ ♪ When it comes to My decorations ♪ ♪ Am I wrong to think More is more? ♪ ♪ Think of all the scares You'll bring ♪ ♪ Think of that test You better pass ♪ ♪ Imagine all will be Cheering boo ♪ ♪ As sands run through The hourglass ♪ ♪ So get on The spooky side ♪ ♪ And do that thing Real witches do ♪ ♪ And show them how We're ready now ♪ ♪ To make our Witchy Dreams come true ♪ ♪ Keep your view on The spooky side ♪ ♪ Come debut Your spooky side ♪ - ♪ Enjoy the ride ♪ - ♪ I'm terrified ♪ ♪ We'll share with pride Our spooky side ♪ Uh-oh! Ahh! [gasps] What a doozy disaster! Daisy, are you okay? You sure doozied up that one, Butch. [whimpers] [Minnie] But how did this happen? Creepers! Maybe I added too many decorations. That's why everything fell down! I don't think it's your fault, Daisy. But maybe if we hurry, we can fix it. [ringing] I'm back, Junior Witches. Let's see how you did on your final test. Oh! What happened here?! Oh, I can explain! You see, I... Oh, I'm sorry, Daisy Doozy! but you tried your best. [buzzer sounds] Junior Witches, your Witchy Tests are over. Tonight at the Boo Bash, I will announce who will be graduating to finally become a real witch. But before I go, let's tidy things up a bit. Bibbity-Boppity-Moo! Ooh! Wow-wee! If that wand can make the streets spooky, I bet it can do the same for me! Time to try on my new Moo Moo! See you both at the Boo Bash! [sighs] My Witchy career is over. I'm never graduating! Oh, don't say that. There's still a chance! Yeah! Your spells did come out okay. Kinda-sorta. And your broom flying is the best! Thanks, but it won't be good enough to help me graduate with you, Minnie. If only there were a way I could conjure up something big to impress Witch Master Clarabelle! Then she'd know I'm ready to be a real witch! Oh, Daisy Doozy, you'll be a great witch no matter what happens today. Oh, you really think so? I know so! Well, at least one of us knows! Say, why don't we get back and get ready for the party? I have a surprise that will cheer you up! You know, Minnie, you really are a wonderful witch... and a wonderful friend. Oh, you too! [giggles] Hear that, Butchie? While they get all gussied up, I can sneak into the castle and swipe that bibbity-boppity Moo Wand! [laughs] [barks] And once I get that wand, I'll use it to turn myself into something big and spooky! [chuckles] This town will never laugh at me again! Daisy Doozy, here's your surprise! Ta-da! I made us matching witchy bows for the party! Oh, they're beautiful, Minnie, but... [sighs] I might not be needing it. - [meows] - Daisy, you are not going to give up hope! There's still a chance you'll become a real witch! Thanks for the pep talk, Minnie, but I think it would take a magical miracle for me to graduate. I really need to think about this. Hmm, maybe I should talk to Witch Master Clarabelle and see if there's anything more I can do. It's worth a try! [Clarabelle] Oh, cobwebs! I need to find the most boo-tiful dress to wear tonight Now which dress should I wear? Oh! The moo wand! I'd better get this back to Witch Master Clarabelle right away! Ooh, this wand is wonderful! But no. No. No, Daisy Doozy, you've got to return it! [Clarabelle] Oh, fuzzle-buzzle! This dress just isn't working out. [grunts] Ooh! She seems very busy. I guess I shouldn't disturb her, but... Wait, it wouldn't hurt if I just tried out the Moo Wand a little, right? Maybe I could whip up some magic and make something amazing to impress Witch Master Clarabelle. Yeah! Then I'll bring the Wand back to her. And she'll graduate me for sure! Goody good plan! Well, I've got a better one! - No! I do! - No! I do! - No, I do. - I do! - I do! - I do! [arguing continues] Ah! [growls] - [laughs] - Come back here with that wand! [barks] [pants] Where'd she go? [pants] [exclaims] Moldy cheese weasels! She out-ghosted me! Well, I ain't gonna let her get away with what I was gonna steal! [barks] Ooh, I can't wait to do some momentous magic and... ghaa! Daisy! What are you doing with that moo wand? Shh! I'm borrowing it. If I can cast a big spell or something, I'll prove to Witch Master Clarabelle that I can be a real Witch! But that's just batty! Hey! Where ya' goin'? Get back here! Sorry, Spooky Loca, but this is my only chance! I've got Witchy Magic to make! Magic Moo-Wand, what I need... Get me flying at super speed! It worked! Whee-hee-hee! Yikes! I gotta tell Minnie! Now let's see! What spooky spell can I conjure up to make this Boo Bash bigger than ever? [gasps] What's that? Nothing screams Halloween like a pumpkin patch! I'll start there! [cackles] [coughs] I gotta work on that cackle! Let's hurry, fellas! We gotta find a pumpkin to replace our broken Jack-O'-Lantern and get back to the stage! Oh! I still have to figure out what our new big song is gonna be! Yes! This is perfect! There must be a way to use these pumpkins to show Witch Master Clarabelle what I can do! - We gotta get that wand! - [barks] If I make the Boo Bash better than ever, I'll be a hero! Witch Master Clarabelle - might even throw me a parade! - [bell dings] That's it! I'll make a Halloween Pumpkin parade! Jump and dance, don't be delayed! Join the Happy Pumpkin parade! All right, pumpkins! On my command! Time for us to strike up the band! [all] Huh? [all] Ahh! Goody good Witch! I did it! If only Minnie and Spooky could see me now! This magical magic is going to help me graduate! The girls will be so surprised! [Spooky-Loca] And shocked! Daisy Doozy, what are you doing?! I'm making a Happy Pumpkin Parade to kick off tonight's Boo Bash! Don't you love it? We're gonna get squashed by a squash! Ahh! Daisy! We have get the Moo Wand back to Witch Master Clarabelle! But this is my chance to show her that I can be a real witch! I thought you'd be happy for me! But it's not right to use another Witch's wand, especially Witch Master Clarabelle's! - Why can't I have a chance to show off? - [Minnie] "Show off"? [Daisy] Like the way you flew in to save Count Mickula and the boys from the avalanche! But they were in trouble! It's a Good Witch's duty to help others! Well, I just want to help myself prove that I can be a good witch, too! [gasps] [Minnie and Daisy] The wand! Thank you very much! Pete! That belongs to Witch Master Clarabelle, so give it back! Sorry, finders creepers! You heard 'em, Pete! Give them the wand back! - [all] Yeah! - Oh, really? Who's gonna make me? [Clarabelle] I am! [Pete] Witch Master Clarabelle! Oh! Obey me now, Pete, on my command! Release my Moo Wand to my hand! Whoa! Hyah! [Pete] It's fun to spin, don't you know? Round and round... - Put me down! - Well, down you go! Whoa! [grunts, groans] Pete, don't! Give me my Moo Wand! Hey, hey, hey, bounce, bounce away! Pete, this isn't funny! You've taken this joke too far! Did you say "joke"? [chuckles] This ain't no joke. I'm gonna show you all how big and spooky I can be! Pumpkin, pumpkin, watch 'em spin! My transformation will now begin! Show 'em on this Halloween Night a Pete-O'Lantern full of fright! [all gasp] [wicked laugh] Pretty cool! The Kooky Spooky contest will be starting soon! Come on, Butch! Let's go show this town the new and spooky me! - [evil laugh] - [whimpers] What? You don't like me like this? Okay, fine! You can stay here with all the other scaredy cats! - Stop right there, pumpkin! - [yelps] Give me my Moo Wand back you big, silly squash! Wha...? Ow! Oh, that tickles. [laughs] Let me go! [whimpers] I know, Pluto, big and spooky Pete witch-napped Clarabelle! But Minnie and Daisy will save the day! - I hope. - [whimpers] Hurry! We have to save Witch Master Clarabelle! - How can we help? - Pete is heading downtown. Meet us there. In the meantime, we'll figure out a Witchy Way to turn Pete back into a ghost! Let's get a-goin'! Aw, phooey! Oh, Minnie! Witch Master Clarabelle's in trouble and it's all my fault! I've got to make this right! Do you think I can do this? I don't think... I know! We're going to make this right, Daisy Doozy, together! Because... That's what best friends do! That's the spirit! [giggles] So let's use all of our magic to stop Pete and save Witch Master Clarabelle! Good plan! But how? Pete's got the Moo Wand! Where there's a witch... ...there's a way! And now it's up to us to find the way... and the Wand! [whistles] You drive! [both] Whoo-hoo! [whimpers] - [screaming] - [Pete cackles] Why are we running towards the big scary jacky-lantern? Because we have to help Minnie and Daisy save Witch Master Clarabelle! - [Pete roars] - [all] Whoa! Pete, This is not [laughing] funny! [laughs] Release me at once! I'm gonna show this entire town how spooky I am! [both] Not if we Junior Witches stop you! Huh? [roars] Looks like the witches have a plan. Maybe I can help. Trick or Treat! Smell my feet! Get ready to meet the spooky new Pete! [groans, exclaims] You wretched witches! So what's the plan, Junior Witches? First we find a way to free Witch Master Clarabelle from those creepy-crawly vines! Good idea! Then we'll find a way to take the Moo Wand from those vines! Leave that to me! [laughs] Oh, Count Mickula! Make Pete get these vines away from me! Don't you worry! I'll get right to the point! [chuckles] - [chomps] - Owie! Ooh! [cheering] We've got you, Witch Master Clarabelle! Oh, thank goodness! - Oh, no you don't! You get back here! - [meows] You wacky witches! Where'd ya go, little Witchies? [laughs] Don't you want to see how spooky I can be?! If Minnie and Daisy don't get the wand away from Pete, Happy Haunt Hills will never be happy again! [whimpers] [Clarabelle] Oh, dear! Stop the broom! Witch Master Clarabelle! How do you feel? Like a milkshake! Witch Master Clarabelle, I'm sorry for causing this big mess. It was wrong for me to take your wand. And Minnie, I'm sorry for being so selfish. You believed in me when I didn't even believe in me. But you never stopped believing. And I never will stop! I... I just wanted to prove that I could be a good witch. A great witch. A wonderful witch... just like you. Oh, Daisy. Some of the best things I know about being a good witch are things I learned from you! And it's your friendship that makes some very powerful magic! [both] It does? It does! You know, I can feel it! Using our magic together makes us... and our friendship... even stronger! - Yes! - Um... hate to ruin the moment, girls, but could we celebrate later? First we gotta get that Wand away from Pete! - [Pete cackles] - [screaming] Peek-a-boo! Did I scare you? [evil laugh] Buttons and Broomsticks! He's scaring everybody! There must be a way to stop him! [meows] Oh, Figaro! Now's not the time to play with ribbon! Maybe it is! Look! If we can make a big trap out of ribbon, Pete will get all tangled up! And we can take back the Moo Wand! Ya' know, it just might work! But we need something a lot stronger than ribbon! My Junior Witches! You must use every Witchy Lesson you ever learned to stop Pete! If not, Halloween will be ruined! Where there's a Witch... [all] there's a way! Oh, little Witchies! Come out, come out wherever you are! [laughs] So how do we stop Pumpkin Pete and his spooky vines? While you boys distract him, we'll set this tricky trap! But we'll need one little thing. Donald, may we borrow your bandages? Oh, no you don't! Aw, phooey! [chuckles] Thanks, Donald! Hey, Pete! Up here! So there you are! Well, ready to give up, Witchy Poo? - Never! - [whimpering] You d-d-d-don't scare us! Then get ready to get squashed! Hey! Wait a second! Where'd those two other witches go? Nice try, but you can't trick the trickster! [both] Faster, faster! Witches Wind! Spin into a dizzy bind! Whoa! [babbles] Now let's raise his spooky spirits! Got it! [giggles] Use your mind to concentrate! [Daisy] And you can make anything levitate! Wha... Hey! Put me down! Now let's wrap things up! In a tidy little bow! [grunts] Buzz off, you bunch of witch wanna-bes! [both cackle] [Pete] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [Daisy] We'll take that! Make me proud, girls! Now let's show 'em how we witches are better... [both] Together! Jack-O'-Lantern before our eyes! Time to give up your disguise! Spooky! Scary! Never more! Now be a ghost, just like before! Wait, wait, wait. No, no. Whoa! Ha! Yippee! [cheering] Oh, Boo-hoo! Pete!
