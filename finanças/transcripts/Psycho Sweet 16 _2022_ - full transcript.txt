Just great. Hey it's me. I'm having the worst day. I just got laid off. Are you home? I'm gotta come over. Okay. Bye. Hey mom, the track meet's about to start. Hey honey, um, I'm gonna be stopping by Rob's place so I may be a few minutes late picking you up. Montrose, let's go! Okay, I'm coming! Mom, I really gotta go. Good luck with your meet. Hey babe. I'm in the bedroom. Hey. What's wrong? Hey. My boss said that they are reconfiguring some of the departments and that my position has been eliminated. What? Oh, come on. You're like the best IT manager I've ever seen. Doesn't seem to matter to them at all. Well, I'm sorry. I didn't... I'm sure it didn't help taking all that time off work for my back surgery, but all these months later, I'm still in pain. Yeah, yeah, I know. Well, um... I just... I wish it wouldn't have happened today of all days. What do you mean? Listen, Cindy. We need to talk. About what? Well there's no easy way to say this, so I am just gonna say it. I have met someone new. Are you kidding? Yeah, I know. The timing is terrible. Oh you think? I just lost my job today and you are seriously breaking up with me right now? Come on, Cindy. I mean, you haven't been the same since the surgery, since you've been taking - those pain killers- - I had a metal rod put into my back, Rob. Thank you for your sympathy. Yeah, you were supposed to stop taking those painkillers three months ago. I don't have to explain myself to you. You're right, you don't. I kept hoping things would get better and well, since I've met Melanie- Wow, okay. You know what? No. I am very sorry that I didn't live up to your expectations, but if you will excuse me, I'm gonna go pick up Dylan. Come on, Cindy! I hope that you and Melanie will be really happy together. Cindy! Don't lay this way. Honey, I'm on my way. Okay, mom, I'll be outside. - Hi honey. - Hey mom. Yeah, how is your meet? Who won? We did. And coach is gonna let me run the 1000 meter next week. That's great. That's great. Yeah. That's, that's, yeah. Get in. Mom, what's going on? I didn't wanna tell you until we got home, but I, I lost my job today. Really? Yeah. And, and Rob broke up with me. Apparently he found somebody new. Melanie. I mean you just can't interest everybody. Mom, watch out! Thank you very much. I'll be in touch. Thank you. Hello. Are you Ms. Montrose's daughter? - Yes. - She'll be fine. - You can see her. - Okay, thank you. Mom? Hi. - I'm so sorry. - That's okay. I'm sorry. I'm glad you're okay, mom. What did the detective say? He just had some questions and I met a lawyer who says they're probably gonna suspend my license and they might charge me with reckless driving and endangering a minor. What? But I'm fine. I know, but, but, no, it's all gonna be fine. The lawyer's gonna help me come to an agreement with the district attorney's office. Okay, so when can we go home? Well, they wanna keep me overnight for observation so maybe you could sleep at Natalie's tonight? - Okay. - Okay. There's something else. Um... I'm gonna check myself into rehab. Rehab? Yeah. I have to stop taking these pills, Dylan. I can't do it by myself. Obviously. I mean, today I lost my job and my relationship and I, I kind of lost you today and that can't happen so getting some help is the best way that I can be the mom that you deserve. Right? Now what? Well, the insurance will pay for three months of treatment, so. Three months? - Yeah. - What am I gonna do? I'll call Aunt Shannon and she only lives two hours away. I know you can stay with her and Uncle Scott. Mom, but what about school and my friends? And... What? I was gonna say my 16th birthday, but you getting better is a lot more important than that. We'll figure something out. I promise you. I promise this is for the best, okay? Okay? I promise. - Okay. - Okay? I can't believe this is actually happening. You're gonna be fine. And Aunt Shannon is so excited. That makes one of us. Dylan, help me get this stuff out, please. Thank you. Yay. You here! Hi, honey. Hi. Hey, kid. Wow, if I can even call you that anymore. Look at you. - How was your flight? - It was fine. - Quiet, but fine. - Mom. Let's get you inside. We'll get you settled. - I'll get the bags. - I'll show you my home. Let me show you around downstairs then I'll show you your room. It's not very cool, but you can put posters on the wall, decorate it however you want. Make it your own, okay? Okay. It's just over here to the right. It's gonna be perfect, right, Dylan? Yep. I've set the guest room up for you, okay? Oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. All right, here you go, you guys. Uh, Dylan, we just want you to know that we're really excited to have you here. Yeah, honey. We're so happy to have you here. Um, I'll give you guys some time. Thank you. Thanks. This is so unfair. I know it is. I know it is and it's all my fault and I know that and I understand if you're mad at me. Why couldn't I have stayed with Natalie? Her mom was okay with it. Natalie's parents are going through a divorce, sweetheart. It's better if you stay with family. Mom, I wouldn't have had to change schools. - I don't know anyone here. - I know, but you will. I promise you you will. Can we just please unpack this stuff before dinner, okay? Please. New place, new people. Yeah, she'll be all right eventually. - She's gonna be just fine. - I just worry and I just- Well honey, of course. - You're her mom. - I know, I know. It's just I need time to deal. - Oh, hi honey. - Hi. Come sit down. Sit down. So your mom was telling me about your running. You know, there's a great track team here. Yeah, so maybe you can make some new friends. I would rather see my actual friends. Well Dylan, don't you have a birthday coming up soon? Oh. We should throw you a Sweet 16 party. Do you remember yours? I mean how fun was that? We were laughing and dancing all night. - It was the best. - I know, but it feels like a million years ago. Oh, honey, we have to celebrate. You only turn 16 once. But all my friends are so far away. Will you even be able to come? Honey, I will do everything in my power to be able to come. Listen, I will plan everything, okay? You can invite whoever you want. Oh, please, please, please, please, please, please, please say yes. Please. Okay. Yes! Oh, it's gonna be so great! Oh, I'm gonna start looking at venues tonight, and we should have a theme... Hey. I just came to see goodbye. I'm gonna take a cab to the airport early tomorrow so Aunt Shannon can drive you to school. Will I be able to talk to you? It's always just been you and me since dad passed away. Oh, honey, of course you will. As soon as I figure out the rules, you're gonna be the first phone call I make. I miss you already. And I love you. I love you, too, mom. Okay. Honey, I'm sorry I can't go in with you. I've got this meeting this morning. It's okay. I can find my way. But if you need anything, just call or text me, okay? Oh, honey. Have a great day. Bye. Bye, love. Bye. Hey, are you Dylan? Hi. I'm looking for Principal Macauley? Yeah, she had to go to the fourth floor. She had some emergency with a freshmen, but I can help you out and show you around a little bit. I'm Julia. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. We actually have first period chemistry down here together, but I thought I'd show you around a little bit. I saw your pic on the newsletter. You run track? Yeah. I love it. Hey babe, you look good. Thank you, so do you. That's Jonah, Tiffany's boyfriend. Star of the track team. He's nice, but Tiffany totally has him wrapped around her finger. Have you studied at all for this class or anything? All righty, top of the morning to everyone. Hello there. Everyone get out your books and turn to chapter two. Come on. Now I know it's early, so I'm gonna be kind and throw you a softball. Can anyone tell me what is a molecule? A molecule. This is not difficult. Do you wanna come over to my place tonight? Tiffany? How about you? Sorry, Mr. Dixon. That's not the kind of chemistry I like to study. Oh my god. Really? Okay, well flirting session's over, so please pay attention. Oh, I almost forgot. We have a new student with us. Everyone please welcome Dylan Montrose. Hi Dylan. Hi Dylan. Hi. Now I don't wanna put you on the spot, but I guess I will. Can you tell me what a molecule is? Um, it's atoms that are attracted to each other. Phew. Yes. Very good. Miss Hartley, you really ought to listen to Dylan. She obviously pays attention to her schoolwork. Okay. Ugh, did you see that new girl? So annoying. Who is she anyway? Dylan Montrose. Looks like she moved here from Savannah. And? Checked her out on social media. She looks pretty normal. Looks can be deceiving. Come on, girls, let's go. All right, your class just down the hall and mine's down here, so I'll catch up with you later. - Okay. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, I think you were in my chem class this morning? Hi. Yeah, I'm Dylan. I'm Jonah. I'm also pretty sure I felt that pop quiz. Dixon can be tough. You're on the track team, right? Yeah. I'm heading that way now, actually. I ran track at my old school. Were you any good? We went to state last year. Wow, well maybe you should join our team. Really? Do you think the coach will let me try out? I mean, if you're that great, I don't see why not. I'm going that way now if you wanna meet him. Okay. Oh look, it's Julia. What do you want? You made me look like an idiot in Spanish class. Tiffany, you were cheating on my test. You didn't have to be a tattle tail. What is your problem? Right now it's you. Tiff, can we go now? Yeah, let's get away from this loser. Gross. Hi. How was your first day of school? Pretty good. I met this girl Julia and we have some classes together. Oh and this guy introduced me to the track coach and he said I can try out tomorrow. Oh, honey, that's great. - I'm so happy for you. - Yeah. Um, I looked into some venues for your Sweet 16th party. - Already? - I know. I got like excited and these things, you know, they book up fast. So apparently Harcourt Manor is the place. Wow. That sounds awesome. Well, I made reservations for us to see this weekend. Is that okay? - Yeah. - Okay, great. I'm gonna go downstairs and make us dinner. Okay. Oh, mom's calling. - I'll be down in a minute. - Okay, send her my love. Hi honey. How are you? Hey mom. How are you? I'm okay, you know, I'm just, I'm settling in. How is school? Pretty good. Yeah? Good. You know, I can have visitors as early as this weekend if you wanna come. Um... What? Well, Aunt Shannon wanted to go see a place for my Sweet 16. Oh, okay. Well, that's fine. We can just do another day. Dylan, honey, dinner's ready. Oh, Aunt Shannon's calling me for dinner. I'll talk to you later, mom. Oh, okay. Well, be good. - I love you. - Okay, love you too. Bye... Hey sweetie. How was your day? What do you care? You can't even be bothered to come home for dinner. Oh, give me a break, Tiffany. You know I do the best I can for both of us. Pretty sure dad is the one paying for everything around here with child support. I'm not gonna argue you with you. I'm gonna take a long, hot bath. I must have run into some poison ivy in the garden this morning. I've been itching all day. Watch out for that. Hey Maya, it's me. I have an idea for that new girl. Are you sure about this? My mom was itching from this poison ivy all day yesterday. It'll definitely work. I mean, are you sure we should do it? She knew an answer in class. Big deal. And she's clearly interested in Jonah. You're overreacting. She made me look dumb, now I'm gonna make her look dumb in front of every one. It's a prank, Maya. Lighten up. Yeah, you're right. It'll be funny. Hi, I'm Tiffany and this is Maya. You're Dylan, right? Yeah. Hi. I ran into coach Howard in the hall and he asked me to give you this uniform for your tryout. Thanks. Well try out are soon, so I better get going. Good luck. Break a leg. That was nice. Yeah, I guess so. Knights, how we doin'? Yes, that's what I'm talkin' about. We have a new person trying out today. You, Dylan Montrose. Stand up. Give her some love. Come on. You ready? Yeah. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go, Dylan! - Dylan! - You got it! Let's go Dylan! Montrose, you have a cramp? Sorry, I'm good. Come on Montrose. Get goin'. Let's go, Montrose! Let's go! What? Something funny? Poor thing. Guess she was itching to get out of there. Oh my God, Dylan. Are you okay? I don't know what just happened. I'm itching like crazy. What? - Look. - Oh my God. I have sensitive skin. Maybe it's an allergic reaction to the uniform Tiffany gave me. - Oh. - What? I knew Tiffany was up to something when she gave you that uniform. What do you mean? She barely even knows me. Yeah, but this could be her warning. Her warning? Look, you knew that answer in chem and her boyfriend helped you get that track try out. She wants you to back off. Well, I definitely blew my shot of getting on the team. Look, we'll just say it was allergies, okay? But stay away from Tiffany. Okay. Honey, how you feeling? Was it a rough day? I was at the tryout and I was doing really well and then I started itching. Oh no. And now I have a rash. Oh, honey, that looks really painful. Yeah. It was really embarrassing. Oh. Honey. - I'm sorry that happened. - Yeah. Listen, I have an idea. Why don't you invite one of your friends from your old school this weekend? Really? Yeah, really. Of course. Now let's go inside and get something on that, okay? And maybe I'll make you some tea. - Oh yeah. - Does that sound good? I think that new girl Dylan has a crush on you. You do? Who could blame her? You 're the hottest guy in school. Too bad she failed miserably at her track trial. Well, she actually did pretty good before whatever happened to her, so the coach is thinking of giving her another chance. Oh my God. It is hot in here. I'm gonna get a drink. Do you want anything? No. Okay. Did you see it? Yeah? - I saw, yeah. - Okay. Okay, okay. Listen everyone. Make sure that you reach chapter three tonight and do the worksheet on the last page. Okay? Have a good day. Hey Dylan and Jonah, can you stick around for a second? Okay. Jonah, you um, you failed the last pop quiz. That's three in a row. Now you know that if you fail this class, you can't participate in after school activities. That means no track team. Dylan, highest grade in the class. 98. Nice job. Thanks. We did some of this stuff at my old school. I could tell. So the midterm's coming up. It's 25% of your grade for the quarter. If you can get that up to a B, I can ex out the lower scores. I mean, I'll try, but I just don't get this stuff. I know. Dylan, I know you knew here and I'm sure you're busy with all your other classes, but if you would be willing to help Jonah prep for this exam for maybe a little extra credit, maybe no homework assignments until after the exam? Sure. I guess so. That works for me. - Good. - Thank you, Mr. D. All right. See you both tomorrow. So I guess we're study buddies now. Jonah, about tryouts yesterday. Yeah actually about that- I really wanted to be on that team. Running is one of the only things that feels normal to me anymore. Well, actually what I was trying to say is- Nothing like that has ever happened before. Do you think coach can give me another chance? Well, geez, Montrose, can I say something now? Your first 200 meters were faster than any of the girls in the whole school, so coach is willing to give you a shot. Really? Yeah. So I'll take that as yes? Yes. Thank you. All right. Well, give me your phone. Um... Text me and we'll figure out a time to study. Yeah, okay. Do you think Tiffany will be mad that we're studying together? I'll take care of it, but I'll see you at practice. 3:15? - Yeah. - All right. You got this. I just need you to focus, okay? Focus and be the leader that you are. All right. Why did Mr. Dixon keep you and Dylan after class? What? Oh, he just asked her to help me study for the midterm so I don't fail the class. First the track team and now she's tutoring you? It's like she's your stalker. It's nothing, really. She's like a genius with that stuff. - What are you doing? - Taking pics of us. Okay. - All right. - Hashtag relationship goals. Oh my God. This is the place? Oh my God! I feel like I haven't seen you in forever! Natalie, this is my Aunt Shannon. Oh honey, so nice to meet you. - Thank you for inviting me. - Oh, of course. Of course. Hi. - Hi. - I'm Daphne. Welcome to Harcourt Manor. And, Dylan? Me. Hi Dylan. Congratulations on your 16th birthday. Thank you. Why don't you guys come inside and I'll show you all around? Amazing. Thank you. Wow. - This place is so pretty. - This place is huge. It's amazing. Well, we can do anything for any vision you have. I mean, we can change these tables, we can put them anywhere. - That sounds great. - That's amazing. Oh, what about a DJ? - DJ Joe. - DJ Joe. Who's DJ Joe? - He's amazing. - Really? We listen to his mixes on social media all the time, but he always does big music festivals. He'd never do a small Sweet 16. Well ask Uncle Scott. I mean, you never know. It doesn't hurt to ask, right? Let's go talk about the details. Absolutely. Your aunt is so nice. Yeah, she's really excited about the party. - Yeah. - So what's going on at home? Literally nothing. But how's your new school? And you better not be replacing me. Never. And you're gonna love Julia. She's coming over later. So, good news. It's available on May 14th, which is a good thing that we came today because there's not another availability until September. But I said I would ask you first. So what do you think? Let's do it. Yes! Ooh, I'm so excited. We'll take it. I can't believe it. Harcourt Manor got booked on May 14th, the night we were planning for your Sweet 16. What? Are you serious? Yeah, I called to finalize the booking and somebody had already come down this morning and made a deposit. How could this happen? I thought you called weeks ago. I did. They said the room was available. I didn't think it would be a problem. How could you do this to me? Tiffany, I am really doing the best that I can. Your best? You're never even here. You don't really care about me. I am doing everything that I can to give you what you want. Maybe if you weren't always out looking for a new guy to be another source of cash, this wouldn't have happened. We'll find another place for your party. There is no other place! You promised me the perfect Sweet 16. Okay, fine. I'll call them but they already said that somebody else was having a sweet 16 there. It was like a, a Diane or a, a Dylan or something. Dylan? That bitch is not gonna ruin my Sweet 16. Okay, let's make this a true sleepover. It's beauty time. Oh my god, you guys are throwing me way outta my comfort zone tonight. Let's go. Hey, what's up? I'm so bored. Wanna hang out? I'm on my run right now. After your run? I'm studying with Dylan this afternoon for like the quiz or whatever. Oh, right, the study date. Tiff, I need her help. What time is she coming over? Maybe we can hang out after? Like five or something. It should only be like an hour or so. Text me after? All right. Well, I'll talk to you then. So what's the deal with this Jonah guy? Is he, like, cute or? I guess so. He's nice, but he has a girlfriend. Oh my God. Wait, you totally like him. I do not. We're studying together. Actually, I have to head over to his house soon. - Ooh, a study date. - Ooh. I don't really like this one, though. Me, neither. Look, I'm just telling you, you really need to be careful when it comes to Tiffany. What's her deal? Well, we used to be friends in middle school and then her parents got divorced and she changed. She's always been entitled, but now it's like a whole other level. I'm just saying, you don't wanna mess with her. Well, my parents are getting a divorce now, so I kind of feel bad for her, you know? Look just stay away from her, okay? Okay, I hear you. I think this is the one. - Yes. - You look great. Natalie's on her way home. - Hey. - It was so good to see her. Did everybody go home? Yeah. - How was shopping? - We had so much fun. - Oh, good. - And I got this dress. Let me see. Oh, honey, it's perfect. I love it. We have to send a picture to mom. Oh, that's a great idea. Oh, did she tell you she's coming to the meet tomorrow? Yeah, I can't wait. I know, me too. I'm so excited. Can you actually drop me off at Jonah's? I'm helping him study for this big exam. Yeah, of course. Awesome. I'm gonna get my books. Okay, love. - Hey. - Hey. Come on in. We can do our homework over there if you want. - I got a little setup going. - Okay. Let's start with organic compounds. You lost me already, Montrose. Oh, okay. We can go back a little further. Okay. Hey, I meant to ask you, how did you end up here? Like did one of your parents get relocated or something? No, um, I'm staying with my aunt and uncle. Oh God, are your parents dead? We don't have to talk about this. My dad passed away and my mom is actually in a rehab for a few months. That's really tough. She had back surgery six months ago and she got hooked on painkillers. We were in a car accident. She's getting help and I came here. I'm so sorry. It's okay. She's actually coming to the meet. Yeah. I'm really excited to see her. Okay, um, let's get back to it. I actually made some flashcards. You're killing me, Montrose. Okay. What do you want? The car was in a different place than it was this morning. And? Did you take the car out? Tiffany, you don't even have a learner's permit. What are you doing? So? I had to go somewhere and you weren't here, like always. Order a car next time. Anything else you want? That bitch Dylan thinks she can ruin my Sweet 16? Not a chance. - Jenny, go get us cups. - Oh, we have cups. - The other cups. - Other cups? Go. Be useful. Okay. Put a little of this in her mom's drink. Should be embarrassing enough for anyone that was going to be her friend change their mind. I know. I'm excited to see her. I'm like a little bit nervous, though. - But it's gonna be good. - It's gonna be great. You see her? - No, uh-uh. - Okay. You wanna go grab some drinks? Yeah. - I'll get some seats. - Okay, love you. Hi, what can we get you? All the proceeds are going to a local food kitchen that donates meals to be elderly. Oh, honey. That's so nice. I'll just take two waters, that'll be great. I'll do a lemonade. That'll be $5. Thank you. You're Dylan's mom, right? I am, yeah. We have a few classes with her. Oh, really? - How nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. Yeah. That's so cool. - Oh, thank you. - Here you go. - Enjoy it. - Oh, thank you. Go Knights. - Go Knights. - Go Knights. Have fun, girls. - Oh, there he is. - Hey guys. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry you guys. Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. Sorry. Hi honey. Thank you, thank you. - Sorry, sorry. - Hi. Okay. - Water okay? - Yes. Everybody good? They're getting ready. - Excuse me, sorry. - I know, I'm excited. This is Julia. She's a friend of Dylan's. Hi, Ms. Montrose. Hi. Oh, call me Cindy. Oh there she is. Hey, Dylan! I'll get your time for the 400 meter, please. Hey, mom! Aunt Shannon, Uncle Scott! - Hey. - She looks so good. I couldn't miss your first match. We'll catch up later. Go, go win. Go Knights! Go Knights! She looks so cute. Get 'em! - Dylan! - Come on, Dylan! Go! Come on, Dylan! Go, Dylan! Go, go, go! Go! Come on, come on! Woo! Are you okay? Yeah, I just feel, I feel really dizzy. Here they come, - here they come! - Oh, go, go, go, go! - Woo! - Yes! Yes, they won! Yes, yes! Yay! Honey, what is wrong with you? Way to go, kid! I'm not feeling right. I need to go upstairs. I need to go upstairs. Well do you want me to come with you? No, stay and watch her. I got this. - I think we should go. - I know, I know. Let me help you. It's gonna be okay. Don't worry. Are you okay? Mom! Oh my God! Mom? Mom, get up please. Mom? What did she take? I don't know, I don't know. She was fine before. Come on. Oh guys. Let's get her outta here. - Come here. - Oh my god. - We got you, come on. - You're gonna be okay. We got you. Okay. You got her you got her, you go her? Yeah, I got her, I got her. I thought she was getting better. Okay. It's okay, we got you. It's okay. Here. Thank you. How you feeling? Ah, like my daughter might never speak to me again. I'm sorry, I have to ask. What did you take? Nothing. I have no idea what happened. Cindy, please. Please just tell me what you took so I can tell the doctor and we can help you. Shannon, I haven't taken anything. I have not taken one thing since I checked into that place. You have to believe me. Just, please. I wanna believe you, I do, but it definitely seemed like you were on something and I... Dylan, honey, I'm sorry. - I'm- - It's bad enough I had to leave my old school. Now you have to come to my new school and ruin everything. - I'm sorry. - No. You can't just say sorry and expect for everything to be okay. Mom. It's okay, honey. Just give her some space, okay? Just give her some space. Oh. Okay. It's gonna be okay. Hi sweetie. How was the meet? I got Chinese. Fine. Did you ever call Harcourt Manor about my Sweet 16? I did, sweetie, and I'm sorry, but there's just nothing they can do. Oh, I need to get this. Why don't you fix yourself a plate? Hey, how did it go? Oops. It was an accident. Are we hanging out after school? Sorry, I can't today. Don't tell me another study session. Not exactly. Dylan found an old bike in her aunt's garage and I told her I would help her fix it up or something. You're what? Tiffany, Jonah. This is not social hour. Do you think spending all that time with Dylan is a good idea? Her mom is clearly on drugs or something. Look, yesterday was really bad. I thought she could use like a friend or something. Does it have to be you? Okay. That's enough. Tiffany, you can work with Julia. Dylan, you work with Jonah. Mr. Dixon, I promise I'll be quiet. You are disrupting the class all the time. It stops now. Get your things. Let's make the switch. I'll keep an eye on her. - Ow! - Watch where you're going. This switch will be permanent for the rest of the quarter. Tiffany, you are not excused from my class. Okay. Get back to work. Oh my God, that was amazing, Tiffany stomping off like that. If by amazing you mean terrible, then yes. Well, so people can see the obnoxious person she really is. Oh my God. Do you think... Tiffany? I mean, who else could have done this? Quick, help me take them down before the bell rings. Get the other side. Here you go, baby. Oh, thank you, honey. So um, how's Dylan? That thing with the flyers seemed pretty nasty. - I know, right? - Yeah. She thinks it's this girl, Tiffany. Her boyfriend's the one Dylan's been tutoring. I think it's just a teenage jealousy thing. - Oh God. - Yeah. Oh, come in. - Hi. - Hi. Is Dylan ready? Ready for what? Oh, well, one of the guys on the track team is having a small party and I didn't think Dylan wanted to go, but she texted me and said that she did. - Oh that's great. - Yeah. Dylan, Julia's here. - Hey. - Hi. Is it okay if I go out? I wasn't going to, but then I decided I'm not gonna let Tiffany keep me down. Good for you. - That is what I like to hear. - Wow. And of course it's okay. But Dylan, before you go, um... What? Your uncle's been making some phone calls over the weekend and... And I booked DJ Joe for your Sweet 16. Are you serious? How? Well your uncle is very cool and he's a lawyer for this band that apparently DJ Joe's been wanting to open for and... And I pulled a few strings and gave him a nice paycheck, but you deserve it, kiddo. This is incredible. Thank you. You're welcome. I won't be home late. Okay. You girls have fun. Thank you. Thanks. Bye, guys. Oh my gosh. Hey. I'm glad you can make it out tonight. Me too. You know, I know I didn't get off to the greatest start, but I'm trying to keep my head up. No, that's the spirit. Go Knights. Hey, I'll be right back. Okay. Jonah, who do you think put up all those flyers up at school? 'Cause I kind of think it was Tiffany. Well, I mean, she's been like a little jealous, but I don't think she would ever do - anything like that. - Hey. How are you guys doing tonight? You guys having a good time? Brian, you know you're in a sports team, right? If you get caught with those, you'll be kicked off. Dylan, calm down. Guess her mom knows how to have more fun than she does. Tiff. Chill. What? It's a joke. Hey guys, I have a great idea. Let's play truth or dare. No, no, no. No chickening out. You have nothing to hide, right? Tiffany, seriously? Julia, you used to be cool. Maya. Truth or dare? Hm. Dare. I dare you to kiss Brian. Oh-ho! Okay. Tiffany, truth or dare. Is this even a game or are you guys just going back and forth? Fine. Dylan, truth or dare? Everyone's waiting. Okay, truth. Hmm. I've got it. Do you like Jonah? - What? - Tiff, that's enough. It's a natural question. All those study dates, or should I just ask of you two already doing it? What? Of course not. Okay, game's over. Tiff, what is wrong with you? Are you okay? I was okay until Dylan got here and now she's trying to steal you away from me and ruin my Sweet 16. Your Sweet 16? What are you talking about? My Sweet 16 was supposed to be at Harcourt Manor the day you booked yours. I had no idea. You should probably cancel. Do you even have enough friends to fill it up? Geez, Tiffany, do you have to be such a bitch to everyone? - Will you shut up? - Stop it! Your mom is a mess. You put on this goody two shoes act. Who would even wanna come to your party? I'll go to Dylan's party. You will? What? No, you won't. Actually I have a better idea. I'll be her date. Jonah, I know that you're trying to be nice, but if you do this, we're done. Then I guess we're done. Seriously? You're breaking up with me? Don't you ever come crawling back! Move. Come on! Are you sure you're ready? Yeah. It's been a while since the track meet and I need her advice on all this Tiffany stuff. Okay. I'm gonna give you guys some time to talk. Just text or call me when you're ready and I'll come up, okay? Okay. Thanks, Aunt Shannon Oh, I love you so much, sweetheart. I love you, too. - Thank you, Aunt Shannon. - Oh honey, of course. - Okay, I'll see you soon. - Okay. I wish dad were here. - Mom. - Hi. Hi. - I missed you. - I missed you, too. I wanted let you know that I believe you about not taking anything on the day of the meet. Dylan, I'm so glad about that and I'm so sorry that I embarrassed you that day. I know you are. You know, the doctors don't even know what was in my system because by the time I got back here, it had already worn off. Well, I don't know what, but I think I know who. This girl Tiffany at school, she hates me, and I think she set you up. Wait, is she a cheerleader? Yeah, why? She's the girl who sold me my drink. She could've put something in it. And she did the same thing with my uniform for the tryouts. Why? At first I thought it was because she was jealous of me tutoring her boyfriend, but then she told me my Sweet 16 was set for the same date and place that she was supposed to have hers. Oh, no. Mom, I never meant for any of this to happen. Maybe I should just cancel my party. Oh no, no, no, no. You are not gonna cancel your party. Not for this girl, not for anybody. We are gonna celebrate you because you deserve have to have fun. Mom, I just don't know what she's gonna do next. She's a 15 year old girl. How dangerous could she be? Okay. Okay? I was reading this earlier and it really made me think about you. - Oh cool. - Yep. Ah, Mrs. Hartfield. So glad you could come in. Please, call me Gloria. So what is this meeting all about? Has Tiffany done something wrong? Have a seat. Not exactly, but Tiffany's been very disruptive lately. It's just not like her, so I thought it was best for you to come in to discuss it with me. Well, Mr. Dixon, Tiffany has been through a whole lot lately. She and Jonah broke up and as you can imagine, that's extremely difficult for a teenage girl. Of course. So you don't think there could be anything else going on? No. As a matter of fact, I wanted to ask you why it is that you seem to be singling out my daughter? I'm just concerned. She seems different than she did at the beginning of the year, so I think it would be best for us to set up a time for you to come back with Tiffany and maybe one of our guidance counselors. Well I'll talk with Tiffany about it but I can tell you right now, she's not going to like that. She's a very smart girl. I'd really hate to see her go down the wrong path. Okay, well, why don't you just give me a call and we can see about setting up that meeting? Great. Thank you so much for coming in. Almost have this. There you go. Hey, I'm sorry about your car. Yeah, so am I. Do you think Tiffany did it? I hope not. She knows I don't have the money for the repairs. - Oh! - Oh my gosh. I am so sorry. I didn't mean to. I'm making it worse. Yeah. Let's go get you cleaned up. - I am so sorry. - It's okay. Here, you can change into one of these shirts. Here, you can change into this. The bathroom's right there. - Thanks. - Yeah. So stupid. Is everything good? Okay, I'm coming out. Looks good on you. Oh, thanks. Um, you don't have to be my date to the party. You don't want me to be your date? Oh no, I mean I do, but I won't hold you to it. Only if you want to. Dylan, I know I just broke up with Tiffany, but I like you. You do? Yeah. And I'd love to be your date to be Sweet 16. Only if you want me to though. I'd like that. Uh, I should probably get going. - Yeah. - Thanks for helping me with my bike. Yeah. Do you want me to walk you out? Okay. Tiffany, can I speak to you for a second? What do you want? Watch your tone. I want to talk to you about why your grades are slipping and you seem so distracted. Maybe because you pulled me away from my boyfriend and basically pushed him into the arms of another girl. Sorry, I forgot my textbook. We'll discuss all of this tomorrow with your mother. My mother? Yes. She met with me yesterday and we agreed to meet again tomorrow with you there as well. You called my mom to come in? What do you have against me? I don't have anything against you, but based on your behavior lately, I think it's best if you meet with a guidance counselor or maybe even a therapist. You think that there's something wrong with me? Not at all. Look, I've got a long night writing the midterm exam. We'll talk more about all this tomorrow. Hi. Tiffany. What are you doing here? Since I'm so crazy, who knows? I didn't say you were crazy. Now come on, it's late. You shouldn't be here. Stop telling me what to do. What does it matter to you? I know that being a teenager can be confusing, but sometimes it helps to talk to someone. Didn't you hear? They had me talk to therapist when my parents got divorced. I'm cured. Tiffany, I know you're upset. You don't know anything about me or my life. Don't pretend like you care. Oh! Poor Mr. Dixon. I hope I got an A on that test. - What? - Nothing. Wait, what's with you today? You're so giddy. Jonah kissed me. Tell me everything. He was helping me fix my bike and we went up to his room and it sort of just happened. Oh my God. Wait, does that mean you guys are like a thing now? I have no idea. I just don't want anymore attention from Tiffany. Dylan, Julia? Yeah. Oh my god, did you guys hear what happened? No. What? Mr. Dixon. He fell down the stairs yesterday and he died. Oh my God. - Seriously? - Yeah. Maybe he dropped his cane or tripped or something. And we have chem right now. Yeah, let's go. Hey, hey, can I get your attention? All eyes on me, please. I'm sure you've all heard the sad news about Mr. Dixon. Principal Macauley is with his family and she called me and asked me to come and speak to you. We'll have counselors available for anyone who needs to speak to someone. For today, you have a study hall period. Books out. Let's go. I still can't believe what happened to Mr. Dixon. Don't you think it's sad? Why would I think it's sad? Tiff, he died. Like, at his job. That's sad. Oh my gosh. Those are so beautiful. Oh, that's perfect. That's gorgeous. Are you girls sure you want to go through this party stuff? Yeah. I'm sure you're probably really upset about your teacher - and I just- - Well, we talked about it a lot in our classes and I think we can use the distraction. Yeah, I agree. Okay. Well the invitations went out yesterday and the only thing left to do is go cake tasting and pick out the cake. - Oh, that sounds so fun. - Oh, it's gonna be great. And the floor sent these over, so see what you like, go through everything and... Hey mom. Hi honey. How are you? Aunt Shannon told you about my chem teacher, right? Yeah. I'm so sorry. Did you know him pretty well? I liked his class, but there's something I can't stop thinking about. What is it? Tiffany hated him. What did Tiffany hating him have to do with your teacher being in an accident? Well, I overheard them talking after class and he said that he was gonna talk to her mom and get her a therapist or something. Honey, I know that this girl has given you a hard time, but are you saying that you think that Tiffany had something to do with your teacher's death? I don't know. This just all feels weird. Dylan, you promise me you're gonna stay away from that girl, okay? I'll try. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. I love you. - Love you, too. - Bye. Are you still mourning the loss of our chemistry teacher or can you help me pick out a dress? Wow. Remind me to never call you when I need cheering up. Sure. What are these dresses for? My Sweet 16. Oh, good. You're having it somewhere else? Uh, no, I have a new plan that'll definitely get Dylan's party canceled and you're gonna help me. I really can't get in trouble with my parents right now, Tiff. Oh yeah? Do you remember that time you went out with Aaron Wilson and your parents thought you were sleeping over here? You wouldn't. I'm sure your mom and dad would love to hear about where you really were. Okay, fine. What do you want me to do? We are gonna call on a tip that the track team has been using drugs at parties. The school has a zero tolerance policy. They'll do some random drug tests and they'll find some prescription stuff and probably more. So the whole team will get in trouble? They'll have to at the very least forfeit the next meeting and if they do, they won't qualify for state this year. But Dylan won't test positive. You saw her at Brian's party. She practically freaked out at the sight of a pill bottle. Exactly, she's so anti-drug, that's why everyone's gonna think that she's the one who made the call. But won't the school know the call came from your phone? I will make my number private before we call. Good idea. If that girl is the reason that our championship winning track team can't go to state this year, no one's gonna wanna go anywhere near her. Let's pick out a dress. I like the pink call one. Well I don't. All right, team. We have a big game coming up this week with the Titans, and I need for all of you to show up, be focused. Be ready to win. Okay? Yes, sir. Hold on a sec. Coach Howard here. Okay. I will look into that. Thank you. A tip was called into the school hotline saying that some members of our team have been using illegal substances. Now the school takes this very seriously. I'm gonna have to look into this. Practice is canceled until further notice. You know, I heard it was Dylan who called in the tip. She's super anti-drug. Seriously? She's gonna ruin this whole season for all of us. I know. She's the worst. Obvious. Where is she now? Hey. Hey. How was practice? It was actually cut short because coach got a call from the principal about an anonymous tip. Some of the kids at school are doing drugs. Oh, God. Yeah. Look, I, I really hope that you stay away from that stuff. You don't have to worry. Especially with mom, that's one of the last things I wanna be doing. Okay. Good. Well, I'll leave you to study, but keep me up to date, okay? - Mm-hm, okay. - Okay. Please tell me there's no more flyers hanging up somewhere. Not that I've seen. But people are staring at me, right? Yep. Not sure why though. Look, I have to go to art class, but I'll ask someone if they know what's going on, okay? Okay. I'm gonna head to the cafeteria. Maybe I can figure it out. Okay. Hey. Oh. My bad. Brian. What are you gonna call in a complaint? I didn't make that call. Dylan, it's one thing not to wanna partake, but you didn't have to rat the rest of us out. I didn't. What do you want? I wasn't sure if you wanted to study. This is our regular time. I'm pretty sure any agreement we had with Dixon is out the window now, don't you think? I just thought we can hang out. Dylan, the track team is everything to me. I could get a scholarship for college and be totally set. I didn't make that call. I don't know why everyone thinks I did. Well I heard it from Brian who heard it from Jenny who heard it from Madison- It wasn't me. But I do think being on a team is way more important than taking some pills at some stupid party. If you think I did it, then maybe I shouldn't be here right now. Well, maybe that's best. Okay. Hey mom, what am I gonna do? Why does everybody think you're the one who planted the tip? This has to be Tiffany's fault. She's been trying to get everyone against me so I would cancel my Sweet 16 so she could have hers. So how do we prove it was her? We'll have to trace the call. Oh honey, I don't think that's a good idea. Do you know how to do something like that? I have a few tricks I could try, but I mean, I don't have any of my equipment here and... Please mom, I'll bring you my computer and anything else you need. Sweetheart, you know that I would do anything for you and I wanna help you, but I don't think it's a good idea for me to be digging around phone records when I'm not supposed to be. I just need to know if Tiffany is the one who did this. Please. Okay. Thanks. Dylan? Okay. Hello? - Jonah. - Oh my gosh. What are you doing here? I had to see you. Well my mom's inside, so can you keep it down? Did you get my text? I miss you, Jonah. And now all this drama with the track team, are you okay? I just hope we don't have to bow out of the next meet. I'll never get a scholarship if the team and gets disqualified for the rest of the year. That would be awful. I also came here because I wanted to see if maybe we could pick things up - where he left off- - Tiffany. I'm still mad about what happened at the party the other night. I can't just forget about that. I'm gonna need some time to think about this. Okay, I'll go, but... I'm here for you. Dylan. Honey, are you ready for school? Yeah. Actually I have a really big favorite to ask you. What's up? Can you drive me to see mom instead of going to school today? It's really important. Why what's going on? I spoke to mom last night and she said that she might be able to help me prove that I didn't make the call. Really? Well how? With her super computer skills. Hopefully. Okay. Okay I'll call the school and let them know you're not coming in, but if this doesn't work, I'm sorry, but you have to go back tomorrow, okay? Well then this has to work. - Hey mom. - Hi. Hi sweetheart. - Hi. - Oh, am I glad to see you. - Thank you for doing this. - Yeah, honey, of course. I just hope it works. - Oh, yeah. - Do you need anything else? Uh, no, just time and a little luck. I'll let you guys go. I got this. Where's your friend? She stayed home. Of course she did. How could anyone show their face after ruining the whole season for the track team? Look, you and I both know Dylan didn't make that call. - That's not what I heard. - Me either. I can't imagine why anyone would wanna be her friend now, except I guess if you're already a loser... Okay, here we go. What did you find? So I got into the phone provider logs for the school's answering service and there's a call that came in at 8:33 PM from a blocked number. Oh, of course she blocked her number. Right. So I can't see what number called the hotline, but when I crosscheck it with the outgoing phone calls from Tiffany's phone, I can see what number she called, and here it is. Tiffany made an outgoing call to the high school answering service at 8:33 PM. - Yes. - Okay, okay, okay. What do we do with this information? I can't exactly call the principal and say, hey, we hacked into your phone records and- No, but we could tell the principal that Dylan's being bullied over it and that we think the phone call - was made without just cause. - Oh, that's good. That's good, that's gonna work. - I'm gonna call. - Okay. Thanks, mom. Any time. Hey. You are not gonna believe this. Tell me. Your mom and your aunt's plan totally worked. What happened? I was in sixth period and they called everyone down to the auditorium over the loud speaker. Uh-huh? So everyone goes down there and the principal goes up on the stage and he said that he has new information about the call placed. _ Okay. So they didn't see any wrongdoing so they think the call was just a prank. So they're switching the investigation over from possible drug use to who placed the call. - Oh my God, it worked. - Yeah. - Oh my gosh. - Yeah. So now Tiffany's the only one that has to keep her head down. Oh, finally. And your party's only a few days away. I know. Oh my... We have to go tell Uncle Scott. Okay, yeah. Tiffany. I hate her. They're investigating the call, Maya. The call that we made. That was your idea. You said that you put your number on private. I did, but what if they find out? I'll never get Jonah back and the whole school is gonna hate me when they're supposed to hate Dylan. Okay, I know you're really upset about the whole party thing, but it might be time to let it go. Let it go? You don't understand. My dad and I used to go to brunch at Harcourt Manor. It was our special place and we have talked about have my Sweet 16 there since I was in kindergarten. So what do you wanna do? Well if I can't have my Sweet 16 at Harcourt Manor, then neither can she. Come on. - We don't have a car. - I do have one, I just don't have a license yet. Who cares? Come on. Maya, come on. Maya, put 'em in the back seat. We're not thinking about it. We're doing it. Okay. Keep up. I'm trying. Put 'em in the back. You stay here. I'm gonna go see if can pick the lock. - This is a bad idea. - Keep your mouth shut. Let's go. What did you do? Okay. Can I have some coffee? Sure, honey. You look like you're in a good mood. I am. So... Why was the car missing from the driveway last night when I looked outside? Mom, you really don't wanna know. Okay. Can you pick me up from cheer practice? Oh honey, I'm sorry, I can't. I have a showing. Is everything okay? Maya flaked on a homework assignment and I gotta go. Bye, mom. Bye, honey. It looks so good, honey. - Hey, good morning. - Hey kiddo. So, you ready to get back to school? Yeah, I feel pretty good about it, actually. Ohm honey. That makes me so happy. We wanna bring you the latest- - Hey, guys. - On a developing story. - What? - Isn't that Harcourt Manor? At a city landmark. A sad day in Peachtree City for all those who love the historic Harcourt Manor. The 85 year old country club was badly damaged in a fire late last night. Police are investigating the source, but Harcourt Manor will be closed until further notice. - No. - Oh. This party's cursed. Honey, look at me. It's gonna be okay, okay? I'm gonna fix this. Don't bother. I should have never had a big party. Honey. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - I just feel so bad. Tiff, the fire is on like every news channel. Pull it together, Maya. No one will ever know. What if somebody finds out? My parents would kill me. Like really kill me. If you would just be cool, everything will be fine. Come on. Hello? It's me. I'm in my car. I'm calling you in between classes. Did you see the news? I'm not coming to school today. That's what I'm calling to tell you. Tiffany and Maya are behind the fire at Harcourt Manor. Seriously? How do you know? I overheard them talking in the bathroom and Maya was freaking out because the fire was all over the news. She kept saying that her parents will kill her. Okay, well the rumors are one thing, but this is crazy. We can't let her get away with this. But hasn't she already won? How can you have a Sweet 16 if there's no way for you to have it? We have to figure out a way to get her to admit it. Are you kidding? Tiffany will never do that. Tiffany won't, but Maya will. I'll call you back. Okay, bye. Hello? Mom? What's the matter? Why aren't you in school? I need your help again. - Oh, hey. - Hey. - Do you have a second? - Yeah, sure. I guess so. So have you spoken to Dylan lately? About the fire? Yeah. I talked to her this morning. It's insane. So what is she gonna do? I mean, is her party canceled? I'm not sure. Well I hope she figures it out. I was really planning on being her date. You really like her, don't you? Yeah. I do. - I'll see you later. - Okay. Bye. Mom, thank you for coming. Of course, honey, anything for you. I told the doctor my daughter had an emergency and I had to go. Did you find anything yet? I was able to get into Maya's texts. Did it say anything about Harcourt Manor or the fire? Well, there was a text from Maya to Tiffany this morning that said no one can know about last night. But that could, that could mean anything, right? - I mean- - Right. And then there was one from Tiffany to Maya that said calm down, everything's fine. And then there was one from Maya back to Tiffany that said you said it would only small fire. This is serious. Mom, that's it. Well, what do we do now? We get Maya to confess that she and Tiffany set the fire. Okay. Okay. Julia's coming over and we'll figure out how to get to Maya. Shouldn't we call the police or the manager of Harcourt Manor? No, I think we should get Maya to confess first. Oh, sweetie. I heard the news about Harcourt Manor. I know how much you love that place. I'm fine. Well, it's a good thing we rebooked your party for the Montgomery Creek Inn. Whoever booked that party at Harcourt Manor is sure to be canceled now. Well, if you play with fire, you're gonna get burned. You know, Tiffany announced to everyone at school today that she's having a last minute Sweet 16 celebration at the Montgomery Creek Inn tomorrow night. Where is that? It's not far from here, but since the news broke about the fire at Harcourt Manor and that your party will probably be canceled, Tiffany's convinced everyone else to go to hers instead. She makes me so mad. What are we gonna do? Well, we have to have prove to everyone that Tiffany is the one that did it. I like the sound of that. Oh, I talked to Jonah today. Yeah, you did? How is he? Well, he was a little upset about your party. Well, let's prove that Tiffany was the one that burned Harcourt Manor to the ground, then I'll talk to Jonah. I just thought you should know. So are you getting dressed or moving out? Go away. I'm not ready yet. Can I at least get a look at this dress? Fine. It's gorgeous. I know. See? Tonight's gonna be perfect. It is. Just you wait and see. Hm, no thanks to you. Ugh, what are you doing here? I need to talk to you about last night. What about it? I know you and Tiffany are responsible for the fire at Harcourt Manor. I don't know what you're talking about. Yes you do. You, Tiffany, some gasoline and a match. That's a great story, Dylan. So you didn't say, "You said it was gonna be a small fire. This is serious?" You stole my phone? I didn't steal your phone, but I did get some help getting some of your texts. You can't just hack into people's phone, Dylan. What do you want? Just tell me what you know about the fire. She's gonna hate me. Maya, if you don't tell me you're going down with her. I can't. I promised. You both could get arrested for what you did. I didn't wanna do it. Tiffany said if she couldn't have her party at Harcourt, you couldn't either. I didn't know she wanted burn the place to the ground. Thank you for your help. That's it? Yep. That's it. It wasn't my idea. Dylan, it wasn't my fault. I think we should just wait here. Yeah. The police will be here any minute. Okay. What's going on? Tiffany Hartfield? Yes. You're under arrest for arson and the destruction of property. What? Turn around and put your hands behind your back. What? Turn around. - Tiffany? - Mom, do something. You're making a mistake, you're making a mistake. - Tiffany. - Mom, mom! Tiffany? But what did you do? I didn't do anything! What's happening? Losers anyway, I don't want you at my party. Sweetheart? - Oh, Tiffany. - Mom! Oh Tiffany, I'm gonna come for you, baby. Do something. Karma's a bitch. Come on, girls. Everything's gonna be okay. It's going to be okay, everything's going to be fine. I'm gonna take good care of you and we'll get through this together, as a family. Hey, mom. Hi honey. Happy birthday. Oh. I told you I wouldn't miss this for anything in the world. Oh honey, I know that this isn't the party that we planned, but- Yeah, no DJ Joe, but he does owe me one, so maybe a graduation party? Ooh. You know, actually, I think I like this a lot better. Oh, good. Oh, I think there's someone here to see you. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, this is for you. Thank you. Very funny. What am I supposed to do? Tie these to my handlebars? I mean you could, but maybe we should go up front. Let's go up front. Come on, guys. Seriously? A car? Oh my God. Oh my god. Oh honey, it's from all three of us. Happy birthday, sweetheart. We love you. Isn't it so sick? Thanks, mom! You're welcome, baby. Of course, I love you. Guys, thank you so much. - You're welcome. - Oh, you deserve it, baby. - Watch out, world. - Can you believe this? Oh honey, you deserve it.
