Is it alright, Miss Scott? It's a very large order. We can take a chance on the United States deal. Thank you. - Miss Scott. - Yes? Mr. Barclay would like to see you in his private office. - Thank you. - Mr. Barclay, Junior. 'Yes, I know.' - Is Miss Chase in yet? - Not yet. - She didn't leave for Paris? - Not till tonight. She's probably doing some last minute packing. But you know how she gets before her buying trip, frantic. Oh, call me the minute she gets in, please. Judy, put this in my office, please. - Yes, Miss Scott. - Thank you. Mrs. Courtney, I couldn't agree with you more. It's hardly the ideal dress for a 40th wedding anniversary. That was sent to Mrs. Courtney? And that was sent to Lilly LaRue for her striptease act at The Body Shop. Yes, Mrs. Courtney, yes. She's right here I'm sure she can explain everything. Mrs. Courtney? I can easily see how the shipping clerk might have gotten confused. Yes, you and Miss LaRue are built very much alike. No, no, no. I'm sure that your measurements haven't changed in the last forty years. No, no, please don't apologize. Goodbye, Mrs. Courtney. Excellent presence of mind, Miss Scott. Mr. Barclay, I have worked at the store as a model, sales girl and assistant buyer. At no time have I ever packed dresses. That is handled by the shipping department. 'Thank you, for setting me straight again.' Is there anything else, Mr. Barclay? No, thank you. - Miss Scott. - I know, where? In the model's dressing room. Excuse me, Ann will take care of you. Oh, what a lovely dress. I didn't mean to interrupt. Oh, come in, Miss Scott. Merely a matter of logistics. - You've seen this dress? - Yes. It's a Fontaine creation. I think it's a very exciting dress. A very exciting dress. There's no way of keeping it up. Even with of all of Eunice's natural equipment. - I can't even shake hands. - Eunice! I didn't expect Mr. Barclay to know but you might have guessed. You better get back to the salon. Mr. Barclay, If you don't mind. I would like to be judged by what I do between 9.30 and 5.30. - Not after hours. - You could have said no. You never gave me that much time. I'm sorry if I spoiled your record. Miss Scott, are you bucking for sainthood? No. No, I'm just an average American girl. I have the foolish idea that I'd like to settle down in the suburbs with the man I love and have children. And maybe, even have a station wagon. And two of those large dogs with hair in front of their eyes. 'I'm sure, you think that's square, Mr. Barclay.' That's square. - Why did you lead me on? - I what? Come on now, that slow inviting smile. It isn't all business. I just happen to be friendly. And that little wiggle when you walk. All women wiggle. All women don't send messages. Alright, Mr. Barclay, alright. I'm sorry for taking advantage of you. From now on, I'll keep out of your way. Or perhaps, you can put something in your food. (woman on intercom) 'Miss Scott, will you please report to Mr. Barclay's office.' 'Mr. Barclay, Senior.' Have my hat and coat ready. Margret Scott, started with the store in 1962 as a model in the customs salon. Promoted in 1963 to sales girl. 1964, assistant buyer. 'Well, your advancement with Barclay Ames' 'has been remarkably fast but..' I don't know what you've been told, Mr. Barclay.. ...but I've always tried my very best for the store. Roger, dear, I told you, if the least little thing goes wrong I can fly over, just like that. Miss Scott, do you think you could handle our Paris buying? Well? I think so, Mr. Barclay. - But Miss Chase has always.. - Miss Chase has deserted us. She has decided to get married on three hours' notice. With all the impulsiveness of a school girl. Oh, that's wonderful. Is it Arthur? - He swept me right off my feet. - Oh! He insists we get married tonight before I change my mind. Ladies, please. Miss Scott, I feel you're too young and inexperienced. But Miss Chase thinks you can handle the job. And my son does, too. That's another thing that worries me. 'Miss Chase will fill you in on all that you need to know.' 'If she has the time.' Now, Roger, I'll make time between cocktails and the ceremony. In Paris, you'll stay in the company apartment, Miss Scott and you'll cover all the salons. 'Especially, Marc Fontaine.' I know how important the exclusive is, Mr. Barclay. We are the only store in New York that handles Fontaine gowns, and we want to keep it that way. Fortunately, Irene has always kept the inside track. (Maggie) 'I'll try to do as well, Mr. Barclay.' Barclay Ames is in your hands, Miss Scott. 'If you do the job well, it's yours permanently.' Thank you, Mr. Barclay, I still can't believe it. I can't either. But good luck. Thank you so much. - Thank you, Mr. Barclay. - You're welcome, Miss Scott. Pay no attention to all that hand-kissing jazz. The only difference between a Paris salon or a Seventh Avenue showroom is the accent. - And the price. - Ah, good girl, good girl. Voila! I will be the most successful buyer in Paris. [phone rings] Oh, that Arthur, that poor darling, he's been running around the block for half an hour now. I'll be right down. You're double parked? Well, um, yeah, just-just don't worry and give the doorman 50 dollars. Bye-bye. (Irene) 'Maggie, there's one other thing I think you should know.' - About Marc Fontaine. - I'll handle with kid gloves. Dear, please be serious. For five years, Marc and I had a very close relationship. Irene, tell me what to do, and I'll do it. I'll mother him, I'll feed him. I'm not talking about feeding him. Darling, you just don't understand. You see, Marc Fontaine needs a very special kind of attention. What special kind of attention? [door bell buzzing] That's Arthur. If he makes a scene, you just tell it was all your fault. You didn't have dinner. I didn't have time, I've been too busy. That's what I thought. Barclay Ames cannot afford to send a skinny buyer to Paris. Create the wrong image. 'Hi, Irene.' Ted, you didn't see a long black limousine at the front, did you? As a matter of fact, there was a cop giving someone a ticket. Huh! No. Well, darling, bye. Have a wonderful and successful trip. Goodbye, Ted. Irene, now, what about Marc Fontaine? Ah, you're on your own now. From now on, I'm just a blushing bride. I hope. 'Spread fit for a queen. Champagne.' Corn beef sandwiches, pickles. Oh, I shouldn't, I shouldn't, I'll miss the plane. if you don't calm down, you fly to Paris without the plane. - Mm-mmm. - What? 'I said save the other half, I'm hungry.' Maggie Scott, you've done a dangerous thing to me. Because of you, I've developed a strange fascination for girls who say no. You didn't feel that way this morning. Very well. Resentment came off with the bandage. Ted, I'm so grateful. But I can't concentrate as long as you're here. That's the first kind word you've said to me. Know what I'm gonna do while you're gone? What? - Take a lot of long walks. - Yeah? Cold showers. Catch up on my reading. Have a wonderful trip. Thank you. (Maggie) Goodnight, Ted. [doorbell buzzing] - I forgot something. - It isn't here. Operator, I'd like to place a long distance call to Paris, France. Yes, Mr. Herb Stone. Elysees 9051. And charge that to account number LO39970. - Who's Herb Stone? - A friend of mine. Writes a column for the New York Herald. I want to make sure someone's looking after you while you're in Paris. [phone rings] It's 4.30 in the morning. This is no hour to be calling a decent respectable citizen. I'm a working man. (Ted) 'Herb? Herb?' It's Ted Barclay. (Herb) 'Ted! Ted, when are you coming over?' Yeah. Yeah, I'd be delighted to take care of any girlfriend of yours. Just want you to keep an eye on her and.. She's never been to Paris before. I'm not the guy to protect any girl. I've been on the other side of the fence too long. Yeah. Keep her away from the places we know. She'll be fine. Listen, Ted. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. I'll meet her at the airport. Right, yeah. I'll miss you. Ted? You did forget something. [airplane engine roaring] [instrumental music] Paris. It's all so wonderful and exciting. Postcards don't do it justice. Some of them do. Will we see the Eiffel Tower on the way? Still be there tomorrow. Driver, swing right on the Avenue de Gaulle. Oh, let's not do the tourist bit. Mr. Stone, are you always this friendly? - Tell me, how did you do it? - Do what? Hook the last of the fun-loving bachelors, Ted Barclay? Ted Barclay is still a fun-loving bachelor. Oh, in name only. His voice quivered with concern when he spoke about you. Oh, I mean you're a very pretty girl with a nice figure. Good teeth. Ted Barclay has closets full of 'em. What'd you do? Did you play your cards very close to the chest? 'Did you find that "no" is the magic word?' Mr. Stone, if you have something else to do I can get to the apartment alone. No, no. I have responsibility. I promised Ted that I'd.. ..protect you at all costs. I'm your Dwayna. That's very noble of you. You know Paris has a habit of doing strange things to shrewd little girls. Their inhibitions go haywire and.. ...pretty soon the little girl's not quite so sure of herself. To put it mildly, she goes ape. And what if it doesn't happen that way? It will. [honking] [tires screech] [car door shuts] I'll give you a chance to freshen up and pick you up for supper at about, ten? No thanks, I'm exhausted. It's been a long plane trip and a longer taxicab ride. [speaking in French] The fare is 25 francs. You're on an expense account, I'm not. Don't-don't over-tip, you'll spoil it for the rest of us. If you get into any trouble, give me a call. Oh, you're the first one I'll think of. Cecile, you did forget the shaving things. After five years, I do not forget anything. Shaving mug, razor, and cologne. Excellent. Ah, yes. Such a perfect taste. I hope we'll inherit these when the season is over. (Cecile) 'He has always been very generous.' Yes, but Mademoiselle Irene has given him a real reason to be.. [phone ringing] Oh, good evening, Mr. Fontaine. Yes, everything has been unpacked, as usual. No. There is absolutely no smell of mothballs. Cecile and I have seen to that. [doorbell ringing] Oh yes, yes, Mr. Fontaine. She's here now. If you'll just hold on a minute.. Ah, yes. I'll tell Mademoiselle Irene you've been delayed. You'll be here later. Oh, thank you. Ah, Cecile. Cecile. Mademoiselle Irene, how wonderful to.. Hello. 'But I'm sorry. You must have the wrong apartment.' I'm the new buyer, Maggie Scott. Ah, uh...but, it isn't possible. We-we have a wire from Mademoiselle Irene. "Arrive Thursday at the latest. Can't wait to see "both my right arms. Fondest, Irene Chase." That was before she got married. Married? It all happened very suddenly. If you'd like to see my credentials.. Yes. [mumbling] But...y-y-you see There was no question. It's just, uh.. ...difficult for us to-to adjust. I understand. Yes, but, uh, anyway, we'll try to make you as comfortable as we did Mademoiselle Irene. Who's the man with Irene in this photograph? 'It's Monsieur Fontaine.' They were at the races at Longchamp. They love the races. This can be embarrassing for everyone. There is no reason for alarm. I will handle everything. [sighing] It is just...beautiful. Yes, Mademoiselle Irene redecorated it. She has superb taste in everything. Oh, Marc Fontaine again. Uh, the Lido opening. Everyone was there. They love openings, and uh-- They love skiing. [giggles] Oh. Here, let me help you. There is no need, Mademoiselle. Yes, Cecile doesn't like anyone to help with the unpacking. 'She's a perfectionist.' Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt Cecile's routine. Go right ahead. [both whispering] - The phone. - Will you calm down? Perhaps Mademoiselle would like a little supper? Oh, no, thank you. I really am exhausted. I think I'll just go right to bed. Thank you anyway. Please. 'Georges, I am getting more and more nervous.' Will you calm down? As soon as I can get to the telephone.. [door handle clicking] It's awfully late, why don't you finish unpacking tomorrow? Mademoiselle won't touch anything? Uh, I-I promise. Pleasant dreams, Mademoiselle. Thank you, goodnight. Close the door. Monsieur Fontaine, please. It's urgent. What? He's not at the salon? But this is Georges at Barclay's? Oh yes, thank you. I'll try there. This can be a disaster. I'll find him. [instrumental music] [music continues] First, try Petit Moulin, then The Bilboquet then all the cafes at Saint Germain des Pres Is that clear? I will cover Fouquet's Grand Chateau and all the restaurants on the right bank. - We won't miss him, I'm sure. - You have been sure before. [soft music] [music continues] [door handle clicks] [dramatic music] Irene. Irene, wake up, it's me. Have a good trip? [Maggie moaning] Yeah, yeah. 'Darling, even a wife would show a little more excitement.' [Marc sighs] Don't feel like talking, do you? Neither do I. Oh. [soft music] There. A glass of water on my table. See, I don't forget little things. Yeah, Irene. It's marvelous. It's been such a long time. Irene? Irene, darling. Irene. Excuse me. [Maggie screams] Please. Please, it isn't worth all this noise. Believe me. Oh, are you coming or-or going? No I-I'm going. 'How long you been here?' Long enough to, uh, visit an old friend. Unfortunately, she was out. How'd you get in? With this, it's my key. It's very practical. Oh, don't come any closer. I wasn't expecting company. Obviously. But there is no need to be frightened. My name is Marc Fontaine. Oh, I'm very happy to meet you. And, uh, where is Irene? Oh, she isn't coming. She got married. Really? Uh, is it someone I would approve of? Oh, he's very nice, I think. His name is Arthur. He's a banker. A banker named Arthur. Wonderful. Well, Irene always wanted.. ...security, she's got it. I'm delighted. And...who are you? Oh, I'm Maggie Scott. I'm, uh, Irene's replacement. Oh. What do you mean, "oh?" (Marc) Just that you're a very attractive and lovely girl for such an important job. It doesn't make any difference what a buyer looks like. It helps. Mr. Fontaine, I have no intention of replacing Irene in anything except business. Nobody asked you. Well, I've never been to Paris before but I've certainly heard a great deal about it. Oh, I see. I see. Paris, the den of all evil. Well, it's true, isn't it? Everybody thinks so. Not everybody, you do. Miss Scott. There is no safer city in the world than Paris. If you want it that way. (Marc) I'm sorry to disappoint you, but the wild Paris by night 'died fifty years ago with the can-can.' It's just one big cliche, but you can have it. You can have it, there are specialists who cater to such tastes. And something tells me that this is what you really want. - Is this a new approach? - No, it's the truth, I think. Any other man in your position would apologize. I've done nothing to apologize for. I'll tell you what. I'll make it very simple for you. Since I'm so dangerous to you, Miss Scott you won't have to be frightened by me again.. ...ever, goodnight. Uh, I hope you'll feel safer with Georges. [door closes] Oh, Monsieur Fontaine, we've been searching everywhere. We didn't miss a single cafe. Perhaps, it wasn't necessary. Now, don't get carried away. You better double lock the door. Otherwise, she'll spend the entire night looking under the bed. Irene, my dear, I realize you're on your honeymoon. But you're not a pair of love-starved adolescents. Listen to this. It's from Fontaine. "Fashion is a business for professionals, not children. "Feel another buyer advisable immediately if we are to continue our relationship." How do I know what happened? We sent over an inexperienced girl whose only qualification was a good figure. Nice of you to fit the store into your day. It's 9:02, what's the matter? 'Irene, you gave me your solemn word of honor' 'that as soon as any trouble started' you'd fly to Paris immediately. Why should Arthur object? Let me speak to him. Dad, we don't need Irene. Of course not. We'll just let that redhead you recommended run us out of business. Hello, Arthur, old man. Pleasure to speak to a businessman. How's the honeymoon coming? Fine. Well, sir, we've got a little bit of crisis in the store here, and we want to borrow your wife for a few days, perhaps a week. I realize this is a bit of an inconvenience, but I'm sure-- Hello? Hello? Miss Lacie, get Miss Chase back on the phone. If that husband of hers answers, use another name. - Dad, let me go to Paris. - Absolutely not. Dad, please. When did your affair with this Scott girl start? There's no affair. In less than 24 hours, this child has destroyed all of Irene's back-breaking work. Son, do you realize your mother and I have never pried into your personal life? Not even when you were thrown out of Rutgers. Dad, you got the wrong idea about Maggie. She's a wonderful girl. She's got character. Since when did you get interested in character? Dad, will you please let me go to Paris? I don't know what upset Fontaine but I'll straighten it out in a few days. - To pick up where you left off? - We haven't started. [phone buzzer ringing] Yes? 'Mr. Barclay, I can't reach Miss Chase. 'She's out on the golf course with her husband.' On her honeymoon? 'I think they've known each other for a long time.' - 'I'll keep on calling.' - Never mind. Alright, make your plane reservation. Thanks. 'Tell me something.' If this girl is as respectable as you say why are you interested in her? I wish I were just interested. There's a lot more than that. [instrumental music] 'Wallace Norton Taylor.' 'Delacourt, Vogue.' 'Matthews, Neiman Marcus.' 'Scott, Barclay Ames.' 'Phillip, Glamour.' Mademoiselle, one minute please. I showed you my invitation. It's perfectly good. It is indeed. For the Balenciaga showing tomorrow. I'm sorry, Mademoiselle. I can't imagine what could've happened. I must have left it at the apartment. Too many people forget their invitations in their apartment. That is why we have to be so careful. Please. Phillips, Glamour. - Livingstone, Arlene's. - Harkness, Magnum. I insist on seeing Monsieur Fontaine personally. I'm the buyer for Barclay Ames. Mr. Fontaine is never available during his showing. Mademoiselle, I've been very patient. You are blocking the way. - Slate, Associated Press. - Freeman, Odine's. Henderson, Harper's Bazaar. [car engine revving] Hello, Leo. - Hello, Leo. - Hello. [chattering] [audience clapping] (female announcer) 'Blue moon, a shimmering evening gown of ice blue chiffon..' 'Oh!' Hey no, no, no. I'm not a model. I don't even work here. How did you get in? No one's permitted. I'm not bothering anybody, really. I'm passing through. - 'Guards!' - No, no, no, please don't. What's going on? What is all this? Let go of me. You again? What are you doing here? I'm not doing anything. Everybody's undressing me. Everybody is always undressing you, Miss Scott? It will never happen again, Monsieur Marc. Let go of me, I'd like to put my clothes on first. Keep things moving. I'll take care of the, uh striptease artist. This way. What? Where are you taking me? I'd like to remain in business one more season. 'You can shout as much as you want up there.' 'It's soundproof fortunately. Come on.' There's a mirror in here if you need it. Thank you. Are you out to destroy all the designers in Paris? Or is this something you reserve especially for me? (Maggie) 'It's your fault. Tearing up my invitation' 'just because your feelings were hurt.' My feelings weren't hurt. I just don't want to be accused of something I didn't have in mind, that's all. 'Any girl would have reacted the same way the way things looked.' No. Only children are concerned with the way things look. I made that very clear to Barclay Ames. You spoke to them? No, I sent a cable. I felt the job called for someone a little more mature and a lot less hysterical. You did this just because I insulted you in the bedroom? Well, the bedroom is an excellent place to judge anybody's behavior. But I'm sure the store will find something else for you. (Marc) 'Modeling for instance.' You don't need to show me out. I promise you there won't be any more noise. When I look back at my first big chance in Paris I'll always remember how kind you were. Miss Scott, listen to me. Come. Now, you're going to sit on this little stool like a good girl. There. Do you have a program? You have to get inside this salon to get a program. Alright. There you are. And there you are. [clapping] (female #1) 'Susan Avalon..' 'three piece ski suit, a golden yellow stretched jersey.' 'The finger-tip jacket is lined with silver gray Persian lamb.' 'The hooded sweater and the tiny cropped boots' 'are also Persian lamb.' [clapping] Don't stare, write. You're a buyer, now. 'Boulevardier.' 'A walking costume, a double-faced wool' 'in camel and pearl white with matching gauges and a gleaming..' - 'Isn't it lovely?' - Don't buy it. It's only for the fashion magazines. It'll photograph beautifully, but it won't sell. 'Invitation in black.' 'A dinner dress in gleaming black silk jersey.' 'Asymmetrical neckline is caught in a huge diamond roll.' 'Monsieur Fontaine called this his table-top dress.' Now, you buy that one. This will pay the mortgage on your store. I don't think I like it in anything but black. Good. The average buyer will be foolish enough to order it in color. They give women credit for very little taste. You want to drink? I am drunk enough as it is without anything. 'Mandarin qipao.' 'Dramatic, oriental evening coat. A gold and silk brocade' 'lined with delicate violet satin.' 'The evening gown of tangerine silk chiffon' 'is formed with tiny crystal beads..' I love that, I'd love to buy it for myself. No, no, it isn't simple enough for you. You buy it for the women who need help. Thank you. See, I believe the women enters the room first. Then, the gown. Most designers would like to forget the women. [phone ringing] Excuse me. Hello, yes? Oh, Denise? 'When did you get back from vacation?' 'Why, that's marvelous.' 'Now, at what time will you be finished at the studio?' Good, I will take you to dinner to the Grand Chateau then Chalet Bondi (Marc) 'and of course new Jimi's. The usual round. 'Good, pick you up at eight.' You are writing, but you're not looking. Come on. I've just made a few note through my-- Concentrate on the showing. 'Roses red, roses white.' 'The opera coat of brilliant deeply plied wool' 'covers the white silk jersey ' 'beautifully draped evening gown.' 'Each tier of the gown is enhanced with tiny crystals.' - Very proud of that gown. - Who's Denise? Oh, Denise Marton, you've seen her in French films, I'm sure. 'Curtain call.' 'An after five suit of gold and pink brocade.' The deeply curved neckline is bordered' 'with a heavily jeweled treatment.' 'The cuffs, the hemline, and the charming little cap are also..' Do you think you're being fair to Irene with Denise? Fair? Irene is married to a banker named Arthur. Yes, I think I'm being very fair. Now, don't miss anything. Be right back. 'Swirling amethyst.' '300 yards of pleated Blankenese silk chiffon.' The cut of the skirt makes it perfect for dancing. [clapping] New Jimi's. [clapping] 'Money honey. Fabulous evening costume.' 'The cape coat made entirely of matched sables' 'on jeweled golden chiffon.' The evening trousers are completely jeweled on chiffon 'and banded withsables. ' [jazz music] Danger Darling is theater or dinner costume. A beautifully tailored three- quarter trench coat entirely-- [gunshot] [laughing] It's...wild. (Marc) 'Don't buy anything that's wild.' It will stare at you from the racks for years to come. Then you will hate me, and we wouldn't want that. [instrumental bridal march] ...wedding dress, of satin five. Shapely bodies of re-embroided lace is jeweled with sea-pearls and crystals. That's the loveliest wedding gown I've ever seen. Women are always moved by wedding gowns. That's the designer's one advantage. Now, let's see what you bought. Very shrewd girl. As good as Irene, better perhaps. Irene was always so clever, I couldn't resist sticking her with a few bad ones once in a while. Now, have we made peace with each other? - Yes. - Good. Hello down there, you were marvelous. 'We never had a better showing. You were beautiful, all of you.' 'Not one single slip up ' 'I'm very grateful. And, Elise, a special kiss.' [excited chattering] (female #2) 'Marc, Marc, that was marvelous.' [applause] [indistinct chattering] No, I'm afraid I can't help you. I am all tied up. No, I am at least three or four days behind. But you were supposed to take care of me and show me Paris. Well, I know I promised, but.. I haven't been to any of the exciting places like-like Le Grand Chateau or Chalet Bondi or New Jimi's. Well, look, some other time. Right now, I am swamped. Maybe days before I come up for air. Now, you don't really believe all those things you said about me in the cab, hmm? Well, of course I do. Of course, it's just.. Well, you see, I can feel people. Well, are you just going to talk about me or.. ...are you interested in some action? Well, of course, if it's an emergency that's different, chief. Yeah, yeah, chief, yeah. Well, have I ever let you down? No. I-I'll be there in no time. Right, chief. You are not leaving. Ah, De Gaulle just called another press conference. General De Gaulle has not been up so late since World War II. There's not to reason why. The republic comes first. The republic. One you saw was blonde or a brunette? Oh, well now, Evon, how can you distrust me? I'll call you the first chance I get, huh? Oh, uh, would you do me a favor? On your way home, would you file this copy at the paper for me? Angel. Oh, it looks just marvelous. I...I have a nice little inn, just outside of Paris. Beautiful, romantic, quiet, they don't even have a register. The proprietor treats everyone just like honeymooners. Why don't you uh, skip a few courses? But it's still so early and I'm not really very much fun when I'm hungry. Eat, eat. [soft music] [jazz music] Honestly, we could go some place we'd get to know each other. Be patient, we will later. I can't even tell what you look like. This place is ridiculous. A guy'd come with a girl and leave with a waiter. I think it's the atmosphere, it does things to me. - Hmm? - Aha. I don't understand one thing, I'm supposed to be showing you Paris, and so far, you've been dragging me around. How'd you find out about these places? Everybody's talking about this club. Who? People. [music continues] Why, you're right about these places, isn't that calm anymore. Even the tourists think they are square. It's interesting to me. You know, it looks that way, because you can't see anything. Look, why don't we get out of this sewer? By tomorrow morning, we could be in paradise. Nothing but the sun, sky, two of us. [clears throat] Now, everybody do a pussycat. Meaowww! [jazz music] Oh, no, no. Come on, come on. Oh, please, but I love it. Let's go some quiet, intimate little place we can be alone. Even if it's just a phone booth. There's no place to sit down. If you tip that man over there, then he will give us a table. Tip? This is my town, they know me here. Captain, captain. 'Captain.' I'll go pay him. Eh, Captain, I wanted you to find me a nice, quiet table. Not too near the noise. Captain? Captain? C-captain, quiet place, captain. [screams] [music continues] Alright, satisfied. We got the table, let's go. Please, just one dance, come on. Oh, no. You're not gonna get me up there. I don't want to be permanently disabled. I.. What have you got, some kind of a death wish? Come on, you're in hip. I've been called many things in my time but never that. [music continues] Loved it, loved it, I'll get your coat. [soft music] [clears throat] [jazz music] [music continues] Animals. [crowd cheering] [jazz music] [crowd cheering] [chuckles] Was that something you picked up in fashion school? I was having such a good time. A date is for two people to have a good time. Come on. Come on, come on. - Well, look who's here. - Who? Denise Marton. Excuse me. Is this an item or announcement? It is merely an old friendship. Of course, that's what Elise and Dick told me. If you could be honest with me, I hate to spread rumors-- I think you are being very rude with the young lady. Well, the young lady hasn't exactly been a barrel of laugh. I still think she shouldn't be left alone. Excuse me. Now that we are alone my dear, you can speak freely. I would speak very freely. Who is the little red-headed girl? She's very pretty. Oh, I'm showing her around, a friend of mine. She's pretty, but, she's not my type. Oh, I'm so glad because she's Marc's. [indistinct chattering] This is Paris as it was, 300 years ago. No noise, no traffic. No smoke, just calm. Peaceful. The only jarring note is the car. I don't mind the Rolls really. This is the island of Saint Louis over there. To Maggie. I know you shouldn't drink your own toast but I can't resist it. It's all so lovely and unexpected. Joseph, Joseph. You're falling down on your duties as a host. Oh, I'm sorry Monsieur, Mademoiselle. It is a good thing you came here tonight. Tomorrow they will take the barrels away and we will have to wait a week for the boat to bring new ones. Right, thank you. Now remember that, when you come here with someone else. I don't think I want to come here with anyone else. Pardon Monsieur. PardonMonsieur. I will have to make my rounds. You will have to serve yourself. Good. Please...leave a little something for Joseph. - We won't take advantage. - Merci. Au revoir. Oh! (Maggie) 'It's just like the excursion boats at home.' In French, we have another word for them, bato mousse. Excursion boats. Marc, please don't make fun of me. Only a few years ago, back in Illinois.. ...every night when I went to bed, I'd pray that someday.. ...I'd get a job in the fashion world. Maybe even go off as far away as, New York. Now look where I am. * The Starry sky excursion boats go by * * And lovers dream the same * Old dream while dancing * Breezes sigh a Paris Lullaby * Along the river Seine * Or on the coast of Maine * All those who care can also share the same as you and I * * That's right A Paris lullaby * * For love is like a carousel and as it spins around * * A girl and boy can reach the moon * * And never leave the ground * So how can we dismiss a setting such as this * * Oh what a bright and lovely night * * This lovely night could be * If you would only share * This Paris lullaby with me I think I've had a little too much. Well, it's just a little red wine it's nothing very dangerous I guess I'm just not used to it. I feel so light-headed. - I don't know what I'm doing. - But, you do. And so to prove romance...is still the vogue in France. * Before this bright moon happy night fades out of sight * * Maggi, Climb on the carousel * * And ride around the moon with me * - Me? - Yes. * And ride around * the moon with me - It's nice on the moon. - Yes. Do you plan to stay a while? Visit the other side perhaps. - What will we find there? - Each other. It's a nice change for a weekend. A moon is no place for a man or a woman alone. - No, thank you. - Maggi. It's...back to earth then? I don't know what ever gave you the idea that I'd even consider such a thing with you, or with anybody else. Maggi. Maggi. Why did you follow me around all night then? - Follow you? - From cafe to cafe to cafe. Just happened to be a coincidence. Oh, really? - Are you calling me a liar? - No. A liar fools other people. You fool yourself. Do you know what you really want, Maggie? You want...a thrilling evening of almost. Yes. Almost romance. Almost love. Almost sex. Maggi. I told you Paris would give you whatever you were looking for. You've got it. And you've put me in the position of a guide. Very well. Very well. I hope I've given you proper service, Miss Scott. Now that we've shown you our best imitation of romance what would you like to see next? The Eiffel Tower. The Arch of Triumph. Oh, I know. The wax museum. Sex. Lust. Passion. But not real-not real, Miss Scott. Just the way you like it. Fake. All in one. [engine revving] George, Mr. Fontaine's things.. Some of them are still in the room. Pyjamas, bathrobes. And I don't know what, please, just get ride of them. All of it, as you wish. [doorknob clicking] Oh, it's Monsieur Marc. George, I don't want to speak to.. - No. - It's Ted. That's a fine greeting. Nice of you to remember my name. I'm sorry. What are you doing in Paris? - First things first. - Oh. I've never kissed you in the morning before. Oh, come on now. What are you doing in Paris? It's a rescue operation. I came to pull you out of hot water with, Fontaine. Well, there's nothing wrong, really not in business. Maggie, I read the cable. It's the closest I've ever come to a poisoned pen letter. Well, we settled everything yesterday. I'm sure he sent a cable by now. You mean, I flew all the way over here for nothing? Hmm, if that's the way you feel about it. (Ted) 'You know what, showing or no showing' 'you're going to take the day off.' We'll do all the things tourists and we'll enjoy. I'll just shave and clean up here so we can start right away. 'You're going to see Paris with America's greatest guy.' 'I'll show you the right bank and the left bank.' Oh, I feel awfully guilty taking the day off. After the way you took care of Fontaine it's the least the store can do. You're lucky you didn't ask for a bonus. I'll bet Irene couldn't have handled him. Wouldn't you be more comfortable cleaning up at the hotel? Maggie, it's the company apartment. I've lived here. 'It's a home away from home.' I won't be any time at all. You still haven't told me how that trouble with Fontaine started. What happened? Did he get up outta the wrong side of the bed? Something like that. - I'm sorry, but there was no-- - Never mind. Hey, not gonna miss my shaving. It's a new experience for me. [giggles] That's the trouble with modern marriages. People don't know enough intimate details 'about each other.' Sometimes it's better not to know. I'll bet you had a fine time with Fontaine. I know how these dress designers are. Marc isn't the usual dress designer. Maggie, you're wonderful. The guy almost cost you your job and you're willing to forgive and forget just like that. [jazz music] You have a very unusual wardrobe. The clothes were in the apartment when I arrived. I'm sure Irene looked lovely in 'em. And I admire the way she uses an old fashion razor instead of one of those electric things. Ted, Irene and Marc were very close friends for years. Of course. And I suppose she sneaked out with Fontaine last night too, huh? - No, I did. - To discuss fashions. To find out how high this years skirts would go? Herb practically gave me a road map and I wouldn't listen. Ted, I was attracted to Fontaine but nothing happened. Did you get cold feet? No, I wasn't sure I didn't like somebody else better. - That's touching. - It's true. [door bell rings] Flowers for Miss Scott. We'll mail you the tip. As the chump who sends you to Paris I'm sure you won't mind my reading the card. "I'm sorry if I shocked you last night, fondly, Marc. "Do not worry about the Rolls Royce. "It's yours as long as you need it." 'For a guy who dint score, he certainly is generous.' [phone ringing] Maggie Scott's house of fun and games. 'Oh, Monsieur Fontaine?' The coast is clear. (Marc on phone) 'Maggi. Maggi who's there?' Marc, I've gotta see you. Dinner, fine. No, I haven't changed my mind about anything. I need help. 'Ivon, it's for a good friend of mine.' Oh, come on. All girls have buddies. Hmm? Five foot eight. Works for NATO, name's Renee. Dark and willowy. Capable of saying yes in five languages. - Too tall. - No...no doesn't spark him. Can you come up with somebody a little less uh.. ...less intellectual you know? Yeah, Paulette. Paulette, hostess for Air France. Aha. Held prisoner by Algerians for three months. After the armistice. - Blonde, 5'2. - Too short. No, no, it still doesn't do it. You wanna wa.. Well, you see he-he's very depressed. You gotta come up with something special, something like.. ...oh now. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. follie brajeu. Follie brajeu, front row, aha. Monique. Absolute standout. - Measurements? 42-24-31. - Too scrawny. Too...right, Ivon. I better call you back. No, no, no, I'll call you back my friend's having trouble making decisions. Yeah, I-I'll call you back. Oh, you I-I-I don't understand you. First, I offer you the cream of my address book one of the most valuable treasures in France and you can't find anything that interests you, then, Ivon, comes up with all this fresh new talent and you can't find the right size. - Herb, sit down. - No, way.. Come on, sit down. Have a drink. How many girls would you say, I've gone out with? I've never stooped to the vice of keeping score. Thirteen hundred and thirty eight. Give a girl, take a girl, that's the round figure. How can a guy with a record like that be fooled by one red head? Ted, my boy, you're not alone. You're just one of the many hapless victims. There's a new double standard. Any American girl today has two completely different sets of morals when she's.. Could you bring your eyes into focus? It'll give me the feeling I'm getting through. Back in the States, a girl... like Maggi, watches every step but she has her mind on just one thing, a wedding ring. Well, in Paris, she has no chance of getting married so she lets her hair down. She does all the things she's always wanted to do. Plus, a few things that uh, she never thought of. Is that clear? Not Maggi. When she hit me with a vase she meant nil. Oh, no, that's a trap. No tha-that's just window dressing. [phone ringing] Be grateful that you made a hair breath escape. Fortunately, you've got somebody to look out for your interests. Yeah, Ivon. Yeah well, he's feeling much better. 'We just had a nice quiet father and son talk.' 'Yeah. What?' Well now, that's imaginative. Simone, star acrobat for the Lido. 'Beautiful body.' 'No muscles. Hangs by her teeth.' Ted Te...where you going? 'Ted, Ivon, hasn't even scratched the surface yet.' 'I just asked her for more refined friends, Ted.' Ivon, forget the acrobat. Yeah, it's only the two of us tonight. My friend just left with, Hagen Haig. Maggi. Maggi, what am I going to do with you? I'd never had gone out to dinner with you if I knew you were going to be unreasonable. All I asked, was one little favor. (Maggie) 'If you wanted me to explain things to a girlfriend of yours' I'd be only too happy to do it. I guess it, because women are more honest and direct. There's no question about that. Now don't bother to make yourself a drink. If your not gonna be helpful. I'd rather figure it out myself. Alright. Alright. You want me to speak to Ted Barclay, I'll speak to him. - You're an angel. - I'll call him now. I'll put it to him right on the line. I'll tell him it is ridiculous that you would show any interest in any other man. Hmm. What's his number? No, not on the telephone. It'd sound funny like I asked you to do it. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Now let me think. What about inviting him tomorrow night for drinks? We'll talk it out. Man to man. I'll explain that you're a girl who can be trusted. No matter, how bad things look. No, that's no good either. Then I won't know what you're saying about me. Maggi, I-I want to help. I'm your friend. I know. Now, what would you say to dinner tomorrow night? The three of us. I'll assure him it was the most harmless interlude. Just a glass of wine on the river bank. An excursion boat in the distance, moonlight, music. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It still doesn't sound right. Maggi. Maggi, may I point out to you that your not being very logical. I don't feel very logical. Let me ask you as a friend. Only as a friend. Would it be perhaps, because you got involved...with another man. Unconsciously. I don't know. Then we've got a problem. You must know. You must be sure. Things like that cannot be approached emotionally. Of course not. We must be objective and completely removed. Have I been helpful? No, no, tell me what you think. I don't know. Before I came to Paris I was sure of everything. And right now, I'm so confused I.. I couldn't even buy a pair of gloves without help. Marc, I gotta have time to think things over. All women should have more than two sets of morals. They should have global morals and then everybody can have a good time. Ted, Ted, what are you doing here? An American, is just as continental as a European. Only it's a different continent. - 'Maggi.' - I'll be right there. Ted, you're crazy. I thought you'd gone. I didn't want to leave you without saying goodnight. Goodnight. Maggi's world is upside down I like that. The best thing that could ever happen to you. - Is it? - I'm positive. Feel free to call on me anytime, as a friend. Thank you. [glass shattering] What's that? Cecile, was doing the bedroom she must have dropped something. See you later. This bed is not safe for one person. It was designed for the buddy system. Monsieur Fontaine, what was that noise? Is Mademoiselle alright? [indistinct chatter] - Maggi, who's in there? - Stop it. You don't have to play games anymore. Nobody gets married in Paris. We can be ourselves. - 'Who's in there? Maggi.' - It's just Cecile. Maggi. You won't be needing us, Monsieur? You won't be needing us, Monsieur? No, ah, thank you George. Ah, goodnight, Cecile. No, ah, thank you George. Ah, goodnight, Cecile. [grunting] Maggie, you need help? She doesn't need anymore help from you, my friend. She's had enough French lessons for one evening. Ah, you're lucky the pajamas fit perfectly. Yeah, they're rather comfortable actually. They're the uniform around here, aren't they? No wonder you were confused. The confusion could easily solved with a traffic signal. Marc, believe me, I did not know he was in there. Monsieur Fontaine doesn't realize you're really a swinger with a talent for moon hunting. - Ted! - Now, why don't you run along? [indistinct chatter] [intense music] As far as I'm concerned, you're on overtime. (Maggie) 'Ted, Marc, please' - Oh, boy. - Stop it. Marc! (Maggie) 'Marc, please.' (Maggie) 'No.' (Maggie) 'Will you stop it, both of you.' I'm sorry. [jazz music] Oh, boy. Operator, give me Western Union. Hello, yes, I'd like to send a cablegram. To Mr. Roger Barclay. Barclay Ames, 5th Avenue, New York City. The message.. Resigning from Paris buying assignment. I'm not the right girl for the job. I'm not the right girl for the job. Yes. And sign it Maggie Scott. Thank you. [rattling] [violin music] [door bell ringing] Oh-oh, oh, ah-a, Mademoiselle Maggie.. - Irene. - Oh, Madame Irene. Madame, it is so good to see you. Oh, you poor darlings. It must've been absolutely horrifying for you looking after that unstable girl. No, Miss. Scott, is very nice, really. Oh, now, now, now, merci, meri. Now, you know how I hate talking behind peoples backs. But I must know every last little detail. When did Maggie first start going off the deep end? What is all this? I love flowers but this is ridiculous. They're for Mademoiselle Maggie from Monsieur Marc and Monsieur Ted. Both? Well.. "I'll crawl through Paris on my hands "and knees if only you'll forgive me, Ted." "Last night was not worth a moments unhappiness, Marc." Oh, very, very touching. Well, they've both been calling all day but she will not speak to either of them. I might've known. Behind every business problem, there's usually another problem. - Maggie. - 'Oh, Miss. Scott is not here.' 'She went out a few hours ago.' - Where? - She didn't tell us. She was very depressed. [telephone ringing] Oh, I-I'll get it. Hello. Oh, Marc. No, this isn't Maggie. This is Irene. Irene who? Irene Chase Marick, that's who. Oh, I know it's been such a long time. I couldn't possibly expect you to remember my name. No, Maggie isn't here. But, ah, sh-she-she's expected a-at any moment. Yes, of course, come right on over. It'll be just like old times. Monsieur Barclay's at the George Sank? Yes. It's time things were handled by a real woman. [engine revving] Keep it. Well, good evening. [door bell ringing] - Oh, we are still at war? - Aren't we? Um, as you wish. Oh, how sweet, you both arrived together. Oh, I knew you'd patch things up. We did not arrive together, where's Maggie? Hello, darling. Wha-well, what ever little problems you've had with Maggie can all be straighten out after. But the important thing is to keep the goodwill between Fontaine Limited and Barclay Ames Incorporated. Ah, we're not interested in that, darling. Where is Maggie? On the terrace? Oh, what kind of a welcome do you call this? I come 6000 miles. I interrupt my own honeymoon. Arthur won't speak to me because I left him in the middle of the golf tournament. Now, where is she? And nobody even knows I'm here. Irene. Irene, you told me on the phone that Maggie would be here. Well, th-that wasn't exactly the truth. I thought it might help if we all had a little heart to heart talk. Where is she? I haven't the faintest idea and I refuse to worry for one moment about that silly, irresponsible girl. - If anything happened to her-- - You're responsible for it. With that ridiculous charade you put on in the bed room last night. Never in my life have known-- Irene, Irene, Will you please do me one favor? Keep quite, um? Thank you. - Ah, Georges? Georges? - Yes. Do you have any idea where Mademoiselle Scott went? Ah, no, sir. She just made a phone call and went out. Phone call to whom? To whom? I-I don't know. Normally, I listen but I was busy in the pantry. She doesn't know anybody in Paris except.. - Except me. - Oh, no. [orchestral music] [instrumental music] [drum roll] [speaking French] Who? You'll have to speak louder. Who, Monsieur Stone? [music continues] But, he left. [music continues] This is delicious, tastes just like licorice. Oh, it's better than liquorices. Has more vitamins. It's absinthe. Waiter,two more of the same. And give this to the bartender for special services. You know I'm glad. I'm really glad I didn't take the plane right away. - I'm glad I called you instead. - Yeah, well it was inevitable. Like, ah, two salmon heading up stream. Either ways my whole trip to Paris would've been absolutely nothing. No fun, nothing to take home in my memory book except blank pages. Oh, well, we'll fill it with small print. The trouble with you is, you've been running around with too many squares. Oh, that's what they are. Marc and Ted, both. Just because they.. I kept tripping over one and another in my apartment they think I'm a swinger. [chuckles] Hey, you don't have to put on an act for me. I had you figured out from the beginning, remember? * You gotta see your mama every night * * Or you can't see your mama at all * * You gotta kiss your mama treat her right * * She won't be home when you call.. * Oh, hi, Mr.Barclay. How are you? No, Mr. Stone hasn't been around here for the last couple of weeks. Sure, I'll give you a ring if I see him. * Every night, you can't see your mama at all * * You gotta kiss your mama Thanks, Barnie. * She won't be home when you call * * Now I don't want that kinda man * * That works on the installment plan * - Excuse me, Maggie. - Oh, this is fantastic. I never would've seen the real Paris if it weren't for you. Yeah, well, I hate to disappoint you but this joint's loaded with Americans. I never would've seen the real Americans in Paris if it weren't for you. Um, can I have some more liquorice? Why don't you taper off? You don't have to set any records. Oh, I'm gonna set all kinds of record. Eh, Barnie, two more of the same. I'm having such a wonderful time. You're very sweet. Hm, well, I haven't even turned it on yet. Are you trying to seduce me? Ah, What, what ever gave you that idea? Because I don't want you to, I wanna seduce you. If a girl is wild, she's gotta work it. Yeah, putty in your hands. [giggles] * You gotta see your mama every night * * Or you can't see mama at all * Or you can't see mama at all * You gotta kiss your mama treat her right * * Or she won't be home when you call * * Well if you want my company * You can't empty hustle me * You gotta see your mama every night * * Or you can't see your mama at all * * Oh yes you can't see your mama at all * * No you can't see your big fat mama at all * [crowd cheering] Do you have anymore places? Yeah, you might try the Qui D'Amore, he could be there if the police haven't closed it. You can then try Herb's apartment again. Have you a Mr. Stone, there? He's a newspaper man with The Herald. Yes, he's an American. Oh, no Americans at all. Thank you. I can understand Ted acting like a school boy. - But you, Marc? - That's right. That's right, exactly. A school boy. That's the way I feel about Maggie. She disappears for five hours. I'm a school boy. That's a wonderful feeling. And where was that wonderful feeling when I was stuck on a ski-lift for 12 hours? I concealed my worry, darling. So that you wouldn't be upset. (Ted) 'Hey, hello. Is Mr. Stone, there?' 'Mr. Herb Stone.' Mark, that boy in the living room is serious. I don't think you are. Why don't you bow out? Irene, I appreciate good advice but I make my own decisions. - 'Hello? Hello?' - 'Hello, yes..' 'Have you a Mr. Stone, there?' Is this the Nice Cheval? I say, is this the Nice Cheval? Hello, you have to speak louder. No, there's no Mr. Stone here. We've never heard of him. [intrumental music] [crowd cheering] Are you sure you don't wanna change your mind? Oh, no.. [chuckling] Aw, it's ideal for my purposes. Oh, the perfect bachelor apartment. Bar...not too far away from the couch. Ah-ha, it is so convenient. I have the perfect view of Paris. [chuckling] If the whiskey doesn't get you, the scenery will. [laughing] Oh-h.. The bedroom? Oh, that's the bedroom. Oh, no wasted time in travelling. Oo-o-oh.. Oh, and it's so practical. A girl can put on her make-up in almost any angle. You made this so easy for me, Mr. Stone. Yeah, well, it's just a simple bachelor pad. - Yeah, but, come on, Mag. - Oh, no! No! It's the result of years of planning and research. Oo-o-oh.. Mm.. Aren't you going to fix us a drink, hm? Why don't we try coffee for a change? Mm-mm...I wanna make sure that you're properly receptive. - More.. - No, Mag. Gimme more. More.. Thank you. Don't be afraid. You'll be gentle with me? I promise. Mm-mm-m.. It's fun when you don't have to be a nice girl. Uh-huh.. It's no use. It's no use. I can't make it either way. Maggie Scott, I'm gonna take you home. Tomorrow, we're gonna sell girl scout cookies together all over Paris. Come on. Come on. Thank you. Might as well wait here. Herb's gotta come home sometime. [dramatic music] We maybe too late. Where's Maggie? Now, calm yourselves. She's in the bedroom. 'You may find this hard to believe.' But I've been capable of the highest nobility. Ooh-ooh. [orchestral music] Hello? Hello, Georges? - This is Mademoiselle Maggie. - 'This not Gorges, it's Irene.' - Who? - 'Maggie, this is Irene.' Did I dial The United States? Don't be ridiculous. I'm in Paris. (loudly) 'Where are you?' Oo-oh, Irene, please keep your voice down. It hurts. That's why I called. I don't know where I am. W-well, w-what sort of a place do you think you're in? - It's a bedroom. - 'Maggie, this is shocking.' I may not have always led the most moral of lives but I always knew what bedroom I woke up in. [indistinct talking] Irene, Irene just hang on to the phone. If you don't hear from me in five minutes I'm at Elize, 9-0-5-1. [indistinct talking continues] (Herb) 'Uh, the continental breakfast goes with the room.' [cutlery clinking] No, thank you. I...don't feel up to anything. Drink a little of this. It'll make your head less horrid. Don't have to be kind. You were right about me. All of you. Maggie, don't be so unhappy. Nothing happened. So glad that you're all so sure. Even I'm sure. Herb told us how you managed to fight him off last night. You're very sweet, Herb. Maggie, I-I don't know how to begin to apologize. I-I never should've sent you to Paris. I shouldn't have lost my temper. I shouldn't have gotten drunk. You've to be in love to behave as foolishly as I did. Maggie, I love you. Come back to The States with me. Marry me. What more could a girl want? A husband who'd turn green every time a man tips his hat to me. Or maybe take a punch at him, if he smiles. Promise, I'll try not to. (Herb) 'You'll try?' Well, I promise, never green with me, Maggie but red, yellow, blue, orange. All the colors of life, Maggie. Maggie, we can take a boat from Paris and go down to the south of France, from the narrow canals, the way no Americans or no Frenchman has ever done it before. 'And then I'll take you to Pontoise, where I was born.' This is me, Maggie, me! Where I come from and where I belong. I love you, Maggie. I love you. Whoa, well, what started off as a simple little family breakfast has become my column of the year. Marc Fontaine, finally takes that trip down the isle. Maggie, what I was getting to was love. Not marriage. Where I come from, they usually go together. Well there is a small bodied opinion that feels that way. For instance, my mother and father-- Oh, yes. The contract. Signed on the dotted line. Marc, I believe in marriage. If love lasts, people will stay together. If not, they won't. Or shouldn't. A piece of paper doesn't make the difference. - Go ahead, Maggie, hit him. - Ted. Isn't that what you do to guys on the make? Or does it sound sound different with the continental charm? I'm not going to hit anybody. Okay, Maggie. I get the message. I'm a square. I lose my temper and I'm jealous. All I gotta offer's a station wagon, a couple of sheep dogs with hair in their eyes and maybe a few kids. Obviously that isn't enough. He's one of the few friends I have I like. Marc, you're a... you're a brilliant designer. And a very interesting man. You're an even better teacher. You've taught me what I really want. If you keep standing there, you'll lose him. Go. If you're ever in the neighborhood your room is always ready. With a matron in attendance, of course. 'Ted, Ted..' Ted! - Ted! Ted, please.. - What's the matter? Did you got tired of that French drugstore cowboy approach? Ted, listen to me. Ted, I love Paris but, I wanna be with you. Aren't you afraid I'm gonna take a poke at him? Go ahead. And I love you. [dogs barking] Aw, Ted! If you knew how tough it was to find sheepdogs in Paris.. Oh, no. [dogs barking] [instrumental music] * Love is made in Paris every night * * Rain or shine, go get yours I've got mine * * Find you dream * Find your love * I've got mine * Go get yours.. *
