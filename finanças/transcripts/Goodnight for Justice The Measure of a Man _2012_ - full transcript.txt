[♪♪] [SNORING] [COYOTE HOWLS DISTANTLY] [SEAMS RIP] [GROANS] AW, SHOOT. [SIGHS] WYOMING TORT LAW? MEANT TO BE BURNED. WHOA! [CHURCH BELL TOLLS] [CRACKS NECK] SHERIFF. JOHN GOODNIGHT. OH, 'MORNING, JUDGE. UH, WELCOME TO RAWLINS. [GROANS GROGGILY] DID YOU HAVE A ROUGH RIDE IN? LET'S JUST CALL IT A RUN OF BAD LUCK. WELL, MAYBE YOUR LUCK WILL CHANGE. YOU WANT ME TO GET YOUR DOCKET. NO, IT CAN WAIT. HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP FOLLOWING ME? IT COULD BE 10, 20 MILES. THAT'S ALL? YOU COULD STOP WALKING RIGHT NOW, TURN AROUND AND LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF. OR YOU COULD STOP FOLLOWING ME. IT'S NOT ME. IT'S MY HORSE. YOUR HORSE PICKS OUT WOMEN FOR YOU? WELL, SADLY, YES. [NICKERING PLAYFULLY] [LAUGHS] CALLIE? MY GOD. JOHN. IS IT REALLY YOU? WELL, WHAT'S LEFT OF ME. HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN? SINCE I LEFT CHICAGO. AND ME. 16 YEARS. YOU BROKE MY HEART. OH, I HAVE A FEELING YOU RECOVERED. [CHUCKLES] WASN'T THERE ANOTHER GIRL WAITING IN THE WINGS? WELL, SOMEONE HAD TO BE THERE TO EASE THE PAIN. THEN YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED SO MUCH THEN, JOHN GOODNIGHT. I LIKE THE BEARD. HANDSOME. VERY DISTINGUISHED. KEEPS MY FACE WARM. I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU. GOOD THOUGHTS OR BAD? BAD... MOSTLY. [GIGGLING FONDLY] SMALL TOWN. I SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN CARRYING ON WITH A STRANGER IN PUBLIC. I'M NOT EXACTLY A STRANGER. TO THEM YOU ARE. WALK WITH ME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE? I ASK MYSELF THAT QUESTION EVERY DAY. TRUTH IS, I WAS APPOINTED. I'M THE CIRCUIT JUDGE. WHAT? YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. OH, DON'T MAKE ME SHOW YOU THE GAVEL. [LAUGHS] I'M IN SESSION HERE TODAY. LAST TIME I SAW YOU, YOU WERE ON YOUR WAY TO SAN FRANCISCO WITH STARS IN YOUR EYES. WELL, THIS IS AS FAR AS I GOT. YOU'RE STILL ACTING, THOUGH. SEWING. I'M A SEAMSTRESS. NOT EXACTLY THE ROLE I HAD ENVISIONED. I UNDERSTAND, COMPROMISE. SINCE WHEN? I'M IN RAWLINS, AREN'T I? BUT YOU'RE JUST PASSING THROUGH, JUDGE. FROM WHAT I AM TOLD, SAN FRANCISCO IS STILL THERE. TAKES YOU ABOUT TWO WEEKS TO GET THERE BY STAGECOACH. THAT DREAM IS GONE. WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE. YOU ARE VERY TALENTED. LIFE DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK OUT THE WAY YOU WANT IT, THE WAY YOU DREAMED IT. YOU MARRIED? I'M A WIDOW. MY HUSBAND DIED, GOING ON THREE YEARS NOW. I'M SORRY. I'M QUITE CERTAIN YOU'RE NOT MARRIED. THAT'S TRUE. IT'S THE HORSE'S FAULT. KEEPS PICKING THE WRONG WOMEN. PERHAPS YOU NEED A NEW HORSE, THEN. A SEAMSTRESS? THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, THEN, I AM IN LUCK, BECAUSE, AS YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE... [LAUGHING] I, UH, I NEED A SEAMSTRESS. UNBECOMING A MAN OF YOUR STATURE. WELL, I QUITE AGREE. I SUPPOSE I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THESE OFF IN ORDER FOR YOU TO SEW THEM PROPERLY. OR I COULD STITCH THEM UP WITH YOU IN THEM. SOUNDS PAINFUL. MEANT TO BE. [PHOTOGRAPHER]: HOLD STILL, NOW. NO BLINKING. [FLASHBULB POPS] THIS COURT WILL NOW COME TO SESSION. [BANGING GAVEL] THE HONORABLE JOHN WILLIAM GOODNIGHT PRESIDING. [CRACKING NECK] WHO'S FIRST? PLAINTIFF JEREMIAH WALTERS VERSUS DEFENDANT FRANCIS B. LANGHORN. LUCIUS BREED, ESQUIRE, YOUR HONOR, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING THE PLAINTIFF, THE UPSTANDING MR. WALTERS. ESQUIRE. A LAWYER, HUH? IS THAT A PROBLEM, YOUR HONOR? NO, BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE, A LAWYER WILL DO ANYTHING TO WIN THE CASE. SOMETIMES, HE'LL EVEN TELL THE TRUTH. [CHUCKLES INDULGENTLY] MR. LANGHORN, BE SEATED. STATE YOUR CASE, COUNSELOR. WELL, I'LL MAKE THIS SIMPLE, YOUR HONOR. THE DEFENDANT, UH-- LANGHORN. YES, THANK YOU. MR. LANGHORN.... PURCHASED A PLOW FROM MY CLIENT, MR. WALTERS, FOR $21. THIS IS THE BILL OF SALE. HE REFUSES TO PAY. WE ARE SEEKING PAYMENT AND DAMAGES IN THE AMOUNT OF $50. MR. LANGHORN, WHAT'S YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY? YOUR HONOR, I DID BUY A PLOW, AND IT SURE LOOKED NEW, BUT AS SOON AS I WORKED IT, THE DURN THING BROKE IN THREE PIECES, AND YOU COULD SEE IT WAS RUSTED AND USED-- OBJECTION! IT WAS THE ROCK-HARD SOIL ON HIS FARM THAT DAMAGED THE PLOW. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH MY PLOWS, I CAN ASSURE YOU-- MR. WALTERS, THIS IS MY COURTROOM, I WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY OUTBURSTS. DO YOU HAVE THE PLOW? I HAVE IT HERE FOR YOUR EYE, YOUR HONOR. BRING IT IN. LET'S HAVE A LOOK. WE WILL ENTER IT INTO EVIDENCE. NOTE, THIS IS, UH, EXHIBIT "A". [PIECES CLATTERING] IS THAT THE PLOW YOU SOLD HIM, MR. WALTERS? I SOLD THIS MAN A NEW PLOW. YOU GENTLEMEN, TAKE YOUR SEATS. IN THE MATTER OF WALTERS VERSUS LANGHORN, CASE DISMISSED. [BANGS GAVEL] WHAT? YOU HEARD ME. THAT PLOW ISN'T FIT TO CHURN MILK WITH, A FACT THAT I'M SURE YOUR CLIENT WAS WELL AWARE OF THE FIRST TIME HE SOLD IT AT THE EXORBITANT SUM OF $21. YOU TELL YOUR CLIENT IF HE SELLS FAULTY MERCHANDISE IN THIS TOWN AGAIN, I'LL HAVE HIM ON MY DOCKET FOR FRAUD. CASE DISMISSED. [BANGS GAVEL] NEXT CASE. PLAINTIFF... [WALTERS, MUTTERING]: I'M NOT HAPPY, BREED. IGNATIUS HAYES, DEFENDANT JOHN EDWARD LOMAN. LUCIUS BREED, REPRESENTING THE DISTINGUISHED MR. HAYES. IS THERE ANYBODY THAT YOU DO NOT REPRESENT? THE DAY IS YOUNG. IT FEELS OLD. STATE YOUR CLIENT'S CASE, COUNSELOR. MY CLIENT, MR. HAYES, IS PETITIONING THE COURT AS REGARDS A LAND DISPUTE IN WHICH HIS GOOD NAME HAS BEEN MALIGNED... [ROAR OF ROWDY CROWD] DANG! YOU'RE A LUCKY SON OF A GUN. I'D RATHER BE LUCKY THAN GOOD. I THOUGHT THAT WAS MY HAND FOR SURE. CUT THE BICKERING. LET'S PLAY CARDS, BOYS. NEVER YOUR HAND, SON. ALWAYS MY HAND. GENTLEMEN. [TELLER]: 20, 25, 30. GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR. MA'AM. [RINGS BELL] I NEED TO MAKE A WITHDRAWAL. OF COURSE, SIR. YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH US? I DO. FIRST NAME, DEKE. LAST NAME, SPRADLING. IF YOU HAVE ANY INTENTION ON GOING FOR THAT GUN, I SHOULD INFORM YOU THAT MY ACCOUNT NUMBER... IS COLT 45. WELL, WASTED TWO BITS. CALL. SURE ARE A LOT OF RAGS IN THIS DECK. YOUR HAND AIN'T GONNA IMPROVE FROM LYIN', DELL. [SIGHS] WHAT'S THE VERDICT, JUDGE? WELL... I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHO THE SUCKER AT THIS TABLE IS... SO IT MUST BE ME. ALL IN. [COCKING WEAPONS] DEKE! YOU'RE BLUFFING, ARE YOU? [GLASS SMASHING] [TOWNSFOLK SCREAMING] WAIT A MINUTE! HEY, HEY, WHOA! WE HAD A HAND HERE-- [SHOTS BLASTING] [SHOUTING] [SHOTS BLAST, PEOPLE SCREAM IN TERROR] [BULLETS RICOCHETING] [GROANS IN PAIN] LEAVE HIM. H'YAH! [GUNFIRE SNIPING] YAH! [GUN CLICKS, EMPTY] [FIRING WILDLY] [HORSE WHINNYING] IT'S LOADED, JUDGE. [TRADING GUNFIRE] I OWE YOU ONE. YOU HAVE NO IDEA. I HAD A KING-HIGH STRAIGHT FLUSH! WHO'S THAT ONE? THAT'S HORACE SPRADLING. THE ONE WHO JUST RODE OUT IS HIS BROTHER, DEKE. THE SPRADLINGS? I THOUGHT THEY WERE HOLED UP IN KANSAS. GET UP! NO, SIR. THEY'RE HIDING IN THE CANYONS UP NORTH OF HERE. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS MONTH THEY'VE HIT US. YOU SEND OUT A POSSE? YES, SIR. THE POSSE JUST BRINGS BACK DEAD BODIES, NOT A SPRADLING AMONG 'EM, JUST TOWNSPEOPLE. THIS AIN'T A GOOD PLACE FOR FIGHTERS. YEAH, I GATHERED THAT. HE'S DEAD, HE'S DEAD! BILL FARNUM'S DEAD! AND THERE'S THREE PEOPLE WOUNDED! GO FETCH THE DOC. WE SHOULD HANG THIS PIECE OF TRASH RIGHT NOW. "WE" DON'T DO THE HANGING. I DO. THAT'S BURT DONOHUE'S BOY. THAT'S WILL. YEAH, SO IT IS. YOU SURE GROWN SOME. GROWN UP BAD. WHAT DID YOU DO THIS FOR, SON? WE'RE YOUR NEIGHBORS. YOU GREW UP HERE. LISTEN, THAT HOLD-UP IN THE GENERAL STORE IN INDEPENDENCE, THAT WAS A COLD-BLOODED MURDER, AND IT WAS A YOUNG FELLOW PULLED THE TRIGGER, TOO! [WOMAN]: IT SURE WAS. MY SISTER WAS THERE. THIS IS THE BOY! HE DESERVES TO HANG! THERE'LL BE NO LYNCHING WHEN I'M IN THIS TOWN. HE GETS A FAIR TRIAL. WHAT, BY YOU? I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER JUDGES AROUND. EMPTY YOUR POCKETS. HOW OLD ARE YOU? OLD ENOUGH. OLD ENOUGH TO HANG? BETTER THAN DYING OF OLD AGE. YOU'VE GOT A SMART MOUTH. COME ON, GET IN THERE. [KEY RATTLING IN LOCK] YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE REALLY SMART, YOU'D BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THESE BARS. I WILL BE. WHEN MR. SPRADLING COMES FOR ME. "MISTER," IS IT? I'D PROBABLY CALL HIM SOMETHING ELSE. YOU KNOW, HE LEFT HIS OWN BROTHER DYING OUT THERE IN THE STREET. YOU THINK YOU'D BE ANY DIFFERENT? YOU DON'T KNOW HIM. YOU TELL ME WHERE HE'S AT, I'LL GET TO KNOW HIM. SEEING AS THOUGH YOU AND I JUST MET, THAT REQUEST SEEMS A BIT PERSONAL. WE'LL GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER AT YOUR TRIAL. THEY'LL COME FOR ME AND BREAK ME OUT! THE ONLY THING BREAKING OUT AROUND HERE WILL BE THE DAWN. [DOGS BARKING] [WHISPERING] WILLIE! YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE. OH, WILL... DON'T CRY. I'M SORRY. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, I'M ALL RIGHT. [SIGHS IN WONDER] YOU'VE GROWN SO TALL. HE'S YOUR BOY, ISN'T HE? NEVER PICTURED YOU AS THE MOTHER OF AN OUTLAW. JOHN, WAIT. HE WAS ALWAYS A GOOD BOY. IN MY HEART, I KNOW HE STILL IS. YEAH, WELL, HIS ACTIONS SPEAK OTHERWISE. HE FELL IN WITH THE WRONG GROUP OF MEN, THAT'S ALL. THE SPRADLINGS? THEY ARE COLD-BLOODED KILLERS. ARMED ROBBERY, MURDER. HE'S NOT LIKE THAT. HE'S NOT ONE OF THEM. SO YOU KEEP SAYING. I TRIED MY BEST AFTER MY HUSBAND DIED, BUT A BOY NEEDS A MAN AROUND. I GUESS HE FOUND THAT IN DEKE SPRADLING. [SIGHS SADLY] ABOUT TWO MONTHS AFTER WILL DISAPPEARED, I WENT LOOKING FOR HIM. I'D HEARD WORD HE'D JOINED THE SPRADLING GANG. DOES ANYONE IN THIS TOWN KNOW THAT? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. I TOLD EVERYONE HE WAS BACK EAST WITH FAMILY. [SIGHS HEAVILY] NO ONE TELLS YOU WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE A CHILD. I HAD ALL THESE DREAMS, AND THE MOMENT WILL WAS BORN, HE BECAME MY LIFE. JOHN, HE'S A GOOD BOY. HE'LL GET A FAIR TRIAL, CALLIE. THEN WHAT? WHAT HAPPENS AFTER HIS FAIR TRIAL? [♪♪] LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE WRONG. I GET THAT A LOT. YOU NEED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC. WELL, I THOUGHT MR. DEKE SPRADLING WAS SUPPOSED TO COME WITH HIS BIG GANG AND BREAK YOU OUT OF HERE, YET THERE YOU SIT. GET UP. YOU'RE LETTING ME GO? WHAT ARE YOU DOING, JUDGE? PREPARING HIM FOR TRIAL. I THOUGHT THE TRIAL WAS TOMORROW. WE'LL BE BACK. YOU TRY TO RUN, I'M GOING TO ASSUME YOU'RE GUILTY. IF I THINK YOU'RE GUILTY, I'M GONNA SHOOT YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT? WITH THIS? I AM GOING TO WATCH YOU SWING IT. W-WHAT? YUP. SEE THOSE ROCKS? START BUSTING. THERE'S NOTHING BUT ROCKS. YEAH, AND YOU GOT NOTHING BUT TIME. WHY? GOOD TRAINING FOR YOUR CAREER AS A HARDENED CRIMINAL. THE HORSES NEED WATERING FIRST. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THESE HORSES. YOU GET THAT HAMMER. START BREAKING THOSE ROCKS. WHO TAUGHT YOU TO SWING LIKE THAT, DEKE SPRADLING? HE'S GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO. YEAH, LIKE WHAT? KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE, STEALING THEIR MONEY. NO ONE'S INNOCENT, JUDGE. HE TELL YOU THAT, TOO? MR. SPRADLING'S TRAVELED ALL AROUND THE WORLD. HE'S BEEN TO PLACES YOU CAN ONLY DREAM OF. YEAH, THE ONLY PLACES HE'S BEEN IS THE FEDERAL PENN IN WICHITA, AND A CHAIN GANG IN YUMA. YOU FOLLOW HIM, IT'S GOING TO BE TO AN EARLY GRAVE. LIKE I SAID, MY GANG'S COMING BACK FOR ME. WELL, I'LL BE HERE WAITING, HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO KEEP DOING THIS FOR? NOBODY EVER DROWNED IN HIS OWN SWEAT. A MEANINGLESS LIFE OF POINTLESS TASKS, THAT'S WHAT PRISON IS. THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE HEADED, IF YOU DON'T GET HUNG FIRST. I'M GOING TO TAKE THE HORSES. I'LL LEAVE YOURS TWO MILES AWAY SO I CAN GET A HEAD START. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT TO YOUR HORSE. YOU DON'T THINK I WON'T SHOOT YOU. YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THAT THING? YEAH. SHOULDN'T YOU TURN THE SAFETY OFF BEFORE YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE TRIGGER? YOU KNOW SOMETHING, WILL, I'D MAKE A MUCH BETTER FRIEND THAN I WOULD AN ENEMY. YOU KNOW SOMETHING ELSE? IF YOU EVER PULL A GUN ON SOMEBODY, YOU'D BETTER BE READY TO KILL HIM. YOU ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S LOADED. [GUN CLICKS, EMPTY] BACK ON YOUR HORSE. YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL. I'M SORRY I'M LATE. I BROUGHT SOME THREAD. I'M GLAD YOU STARTED WITHOUT ME. AND WE'LL BE FINISHING WITHOUT YOU. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I THINK YOU DO. YOUR BOY'S A SINNER. NO, ANNA, HE ISN'T-- THAT MAKES YOU ONE, TOO. PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN-- THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY. YOU THINK YOU KNOW A PERSON, THEN YOU FIND OUT SHE'S BEEN LYING TO YOU FOR YEARS. BUT YOU DO KNOW ME, ANNA. YOU DO. YEAH, WELL, NOW WE KNOW YOU BETTER. PLEASE LEAVE MY HOUSE. [SNIFFLES] WELL, I SPENT $3.00 ON THE SUPPLIES. GET IT FROM THE SPRADLINGS. IT IS NOT THAT I AM WITHOUT COMPASSION, LADIES, IT'S JUST THAT I CANNOT TOLERATE A LIE. I KNOW. MORNING. THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY UP THERE NOW. THEY'RE GOING TO RUN HER OUT OF TOWN. LET'S GO! HEY, GET OFF YOUR FANNY! COME ON, SHE'S UP THERE. COME ON, YOU'RE ALL GOING TO WANT TO SEE THIS! THAT MAKES HIM AN OUTLAW! AND RAWLINS IS-- [CALLIE]: STOP THAT! RAWLINS IS TIRED OF OUTLAWS! HE'S A MURDERER AND HE'S GONNA HANG! MY SON IS NOT A MURDERER! YOUR SON'S GONNA HANG TODAY, CALLIE! AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT! YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE. IT'S ABOUT TIME, YOUR HONOR, JUSTICE IS SERVED HERE IN RAWLINS. IT WILL BE, TOMORROW MORNING IN MY COURTROOM. YOU PEOPLE, GO HOME NOW, THAT'S AN ORDER. YOU'RE HERE TO SUPPORT THE MOTHER OF A CRIMINAL? NOW, WHY IS IT THAT I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL GIVE THAT BOY AN IMPARTIAL TRIAL? THERE ARE PAINT SPLATTERS ON YOUR SHOES, COUNSELOR, WHICH I FIND SURPRISING. CURIOUS THAT AN UPSTANDING ATTORNEY WOULD SULLY HIS REPUTATION BY GETTING INVOLVED IN THE COMMISSION OF A PETTY CRIME WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY LEGAL WAYS FOR YOU TO BE DISHONEST. ARE YOU ACCUSING ME OF SOMETHING? MALICIOUS DESTRUCTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY, FOR STARTERS. YOU BE IN MY COURTROOM TOMORROW MORNING, AND I'D RECOMMEND THAT YOU RETAIN SOME COMPETENT COUNSEL. [MAN]: QUIT YOUR LEGAL JABBER AND LET'S HANG THAT BOY! THE REST OF YOU, GO NOW. THAT'S AN ORDER. [MAN]: THERE'S NO JUSTICE IN THIS TOWN. [MAN 2]: LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS? IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. I'VE LIVED NEARLY HALF MY LIFE WITH THESE PEOPLE. THEY WON'T HARM ME. YEAH, WELL, I'VE SEEN THE HARM PEOPLE CAN DO. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE VENGEANCE. IS WILLIAM SAFE IN THAT JAIL? HE'S SAFER IN THAN OUT. I KNOW YOU DON'T THINK MUCH OF HIM. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO THINK? I'VE MADE SUCH A MESS OF THINGS, SO MANY STUPID MISTAKES. WE ALL HAVE. YOU TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT. I THINK MAYBE IF YOU KNEW ME A LITTLE BETTER, YOU MIGHT NOT SAY THAT. I KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH. OH, JOHN, LET HIM GO. PLEASE, AND I PROMISE, YOU WILL NEVER HEAR OF HIM AGAIN. HOW CAN YOU PROMISE THAT, CALLIE? DON'T LET HIM HANG, PLEASE. HE'S AN ACCESSORY TO MURDER. THAT IS A HANGING OFFENSE. BUT YOU CAN'T HANG HIM. YOU JUST CAN'T. HE'S NOT JUST MY SON. YOU'RE HIS FATHER. I'M NOT HIS... FATHER, CALLIE. I'M NOT. HE, UH... HE'S TOO OLD. HE'S TOO YOUNG. HOW OLD IS HE? [WHISPERING] 15 YEARS AND NINE MONTHS. I WAS HALFWAY TO SAN FRANCISCO WHEN I LEARNED I WAS GOING TO HAVE A BABY. IT NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU TO TURN BACK? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD IT WOULD HAVE BEEN, FACING MY FAMILY, NO HUSBAND, WITH A BABY ON THE WAY? I GOT AS FAR AS RAWLINS, AND THERE WAS A GOOD MAN WHO WAS WILLING TO MARRY ME. HE SAID HE WOULD RAISE THE BABY AS HIS OWN. I DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER OPTIONS. I DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE ELSE TO TURN TO, AND I WAS SO FRIGHTENED. YOU MIGHT HAVE GIVEN ME THE CHANCE. AND WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF YOU HAD KNOWN? OFFERED TO MARRY ME? WE'LL NEVER KNOW NOW, WILL WE? OH... YOU'D HAVE BEEN MISERABLE. OH, I COULDN'T BE MORE MISERABLE... NOT MORE MISERABLE THAN I AM AT RIGHT NOW. [MAN]: THEY'RE COMIN'! THEY'RE COMIN'! THAT'S THEM. DAY OF RECKONING, MISSY. WE'RE GONNA GET OUR JUSTICE TODAY. THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY. MAY I ADDRESS THE COURT-- NO. I MOTION THAT YOU RECUSE YOURSELF-- MOTION DENIED. SIT DOWN. [BANGS GAVEL] THIS COURT IS NOW IN SESSION, THE HONORABLE JOHN WILLIAM GOODNIGHT PRESIDING. SHERIFF, BRING IN THE PRISONER. YES, SIR. [APPLE THUDS] [CROWD ROARING AND JEERING, SHERIFF SHOUTING IN PROTEST] [BANGING GAVEL] ORDER! ORDER IN THIS COURT! ANYONE ELSE HURTLING ANY OBJECTS IN THIS COURTROOM WILL BE HELD IN CONTEMPT OF COURT. IS THAT UNDERSTOOD? [BANGS GAVEL] YOU'RE BEING ACCUSED OF ACCESSORY TO ROBBERY AND MURDER. DO YOU HAVE ANY LEGAL DEFENCE? NO. WHO WOULD DEFEND ME IN THIS TOWN? DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE CHARGES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST YOU? PLACE YOUR RIGHT HAND ON THE BIBLE. DO YOU SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, SO HELP YOU GOD? I DO. VERY WELL. HAVE A SEAT, STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD. WILLIAM SPRADLING. [CROWD GASPS IN SHOCK] HA! THAT'S A KILLER'S NAME! MURDERER! [BANGING GAVEL] IS THAT THE NAME YOU WERE BORN WITH? NO, SIR. SO YOU'VE BEEN ON THE STAND FOR ALL OF 30 SECONDS, ALREADY YOU'RE PERJURING YOURSELF? SPRADLING BECAUSE HE TOOK ME IN. BECAUSE HE TREATED ME FAIR. SO IF JESSE JAMES TOOK YOU IN AND TREATED YOU FAIR, YOU'D TAKE HIS NAME? DEKE SPRADLING'S NOT LIKE JESSE JAMES. SON, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS DEKE SPRADLING'S STILL ALIVE, FOR NOW. YOU DON'T KNOW HIM. CLEARLY, YOU DON'T EITHER. YOU TALK ABOUT HIM LIKE HE'S SOME KIND OF SAINT. YEAH, WELL, HE'S NOT THE DEVIL EITHER. I'M A LITTLE RUSTY ON MY BIBLE STUDY, BUT I DO REMEMBER A VERSE, "EVEN SATAN CAN DISGUISE HIMSELF AS AN ANGEL OF LIGHT." CORINTHIANS 11:14. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M GOING TO READ FROM A LIST OF NAMES. WHEN I SAY YOUR NAME, I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D STAND UP. LOUELLA DRADER... SARA ANN JONES... SETH OLSON... THE CAMPOS FAMILY... THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUMMONED HERE TODAY TO GIVE TESTIMONY. EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS LOST A LOVED ONE AT THE HAND OF DEKE SPRADLING. SARA ANN, WILL YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? DEKE SPRADLING CAME INTO OUR HOUSE ONE NIGHT. IT WAS LATE, AND HE WOKE ME... [CRYING] HE HAD ME COOK HIM A MEAL, AND THEN MY BROTHER WOKE UP, AND HE TOLD HIM TO LEAVE, AND... AND THEN HE KILLED MY BROTHER. [CROWD MURMURING IN SYMPATHY] FOR NO REASON AT ALL. THANK YOU. YOU MAY BE SEATED. WOULD YOU CARE TO HEAR MORE? BECAUSE, I ASSURE YOU, THERE IS A LOT MORE. NO, SIR. SPEAK UP. NO, I WOULD NOT LIKE TO HEAR ANY MORE. WHY DON'T YOU TELL THIS COURT EXACTLY HOW IT IS YOU CAME TO BE INVOLVED WITH THE SPRADLING GANG. I WAS WORKING AT A LIVERY STABLE, AND... HE SHOWED UP ONE DAY, AND SAW I WAS GOOD WITH HORSES, AND SO HE OFFERED ME A JOB. GOOD PAY? A LOT BETTER THAN ANYTHING I'D MAKE HERE. YOUR MOTHER'S IN THIS COURT TODAY. YOU JUST LEFT HER? I FIGURED I WAS DOING HER A FAVOR. HOW'S THAT? [SIGHS] NO ONE WANTS A WOMAN WITH A CHILD WHO ISN'T THEIRS. [CROWD GASPING IN SHOCK] BUT YOU HAD A FATHER. HE RAISED ME, BUT HE WASN'T MY REAL FATHER. [CROWD SHOUTING IN OUTRAGE] ORDER! WHY DO YOU SAY THAT, WILL? BECAUSE HE INFORMED ME OF THE FACT, BEFORE I LEFT. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? I COULD HAVE ASKED YOU THE SAME. I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT YOU. YOU'RE SPEAKING OUT OF ORDER. WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THE COURT? [WHISPERS] I ONLY WISH I COULD CHANGE THE PAST. AS FAR AS I KNOW, TIME ONLY TRAVELS IN ONE DIRECTION. I'M SO SORRY, WILL. YOU'VE CAUSED A LOT OF PAIN HERE. SORROW. I REALIZE THAT. DO YOU HAVE ANY REMORSE? YES, SIR. DID YOU EVER ROB ANYBODY? NO. DID YOU EVER KILL ANYONE? NO, SIR. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO SHOOT A GUN? I DO, BUT I'M NOT THAT GOOD OF A SHOT. I DON'T LIKE GUNS THAT MUCH. THEY SPOOK THE HORSES. SO, I'M TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE EXTENT OF YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE SPRADLINGS WAS, UH, YOU TENDED THE HORSES? YES, SIR. [SCOFFS OF DERISION] SARA ANN. COULD YOU STAND UP AGAIN FOR ME, PLEASE? YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A VERY BRAVE YOUNG LADY, WHEN YOU GAVE YOUR TESTIMONY EARLIER. I'M SORRY TO HAVE TO DO THIS, BUT I NEED TO ASK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION. DO YOU NEED A MOMENT? LOOK AT THE DEFENDANT. DID YOU SEE THAT YOUNG MAN ON THE NIGHT DEKE SPRADLING KILLED YOUR BROTHER? NO. [CROWD MURMURING] NO, YOUR HONOR. I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE. THANK YOU. YOU MAY HAVE A SEAT. WILL, WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I WITNESSED MY WHOLE FAMILY MURDERED. I HAD NOTHING. I WAS OBSESSED WITH VENGEANCE, BUT SOMEONE SHOWED ME KINDNESS. SHE TOOK ME IN, SHE... SHE TOOK CARE OF ME. SHE WAS A GOOD PERSON. SEE, SOMETIMES, THAT'S ALL IT TAKES IS ONE PERSON, IT CAN CHANGE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. YOU WERE TAKEN IN BY DEKE SPRADLING. HE MADE YOU FEEL IMPORTANT, FEEL LIKE YOU BELONGED. THE PEOPLE IN THIS COURTROOM, THEY DON'T CARE HOW YOU FEEL. NO, THEY... THEY CAME HERE TODAY LOOKING FOR BLOOD. THEY DON'T CARE IF IT'S INNOCENT BLOOD. I'LL MAKE MY RULING TOMORROW. THIS COURT IS ADJOURNED. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! YOUR HONOR, I PROTEST! WE HAVE HAD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH OF YOUR SO-CALLED JUSTICE. HE IS GOING TO DIE TODAY-- WHETHER YOU CONSENT TO IT OR NOT! NO, HE ISN'T! [BANGS GAVEL] MR. BREED, YOU'VE MADE IT VERY CLEAR YOU WANT SOMEONE TO DIE HERE TODAY. I AM VERY CLOSE TO ACCOMMODATING YOU. I CAN ASSURE, HOWEVER, IT WILL NOT BE THAT YOUNG MAN. SHERIFF, ESCORT THE PRISONER TO JAIL. YES, SIR. [TOWNSFOLK SHOUTING ANGRILY] BRING HIM OUT HERE! BRING HIM OUT HERE! COME ON OUT! [CROWD SHOUTING] THEY WANT VENGEANCE. I'M RIDING OUT TO GET SPRADLING. HE'S THE GUILTY ONE. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TRACK HIM ALL BY YOURSELF? WILL'S GOING TO TAKE ME. WHAT? HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. JOHN, HE'S SAFER HERE IN THIS JAIL. YOU TOLD ME SO YOURSELF. HANGING ONE BOY IS NOT GOING TO STOP THE SPRADLING GANG FROM COMING BACK TO THIS TOWN TO ROB AND MURDER UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT. NOW, IF YOU WANT TO KILL A SNAKE, YOU CUT ITS HEAD OFF, NOT THE TAIL. AND YOU'RE THE ONE TO DO THAT? I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER VOLUNTEERS AROUND. THAT BOY'S GONNA LEAD YOU STRAIGHT INTO A TRAP. MAYBE. LOOK, GET HIM OUT BACK WITH THE HORSES AND I'LL BE THERE. LISTEN TO ME-- I'LL RIDE WITH YOU. I'M NOT LOSING HIM AGAIN-- NO, CALLIE, STAY HERE-- JOHN-- I WILL FOLLOW YOU, YOU KNOW I WILL! OKAY. YOU CAN GO. I NEVER COULD WIN WITH YOU. GET HIS STUFF OUT OF THE CELL. NO! LET ME OUT! YOU KNOW, HE'S HOT-HEADED. HE PROBABLY GETS THAT FROM YOU. OR YOU. HMM. OR DO YOU STILL NOT BELIEVE HE'S YOURS? I BELIEVE YOU'D SAY ANYTHING TO PROTECT HIM. NOT IF IT MEANT LYING TO YOU. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE HE'S YOUR SON, WHY ARE YOU HELPING HIM? HE DESERVES ANOTHER CHANCE IN THIS WORLD. I DON'T KNOW IF I HATE YOU OR IF I LOVE YOU RIGHT NOW. I CAN LIVE WITH THAT. [KEYS RATTLE AS THEY DROP] LOOK AFTER HER. KEEP HER SAFE. I SURE WILL, JUDGE. I'LL TRY TO BUY YOU SOME TIME. [MOB SHOUTING ANGRILY] I ORDER YOU PEOPLE TO DISPERSE AND DEPART AND GO ON BACK TO YOUR HOMES. YOU UNDERSTAND? PUT THEM TORCHES OUT BEFORE YOU SET SOMETHING ON FIRE. I'VE GIVEN YOU PEOPLE FAIR WARNING. I'LL SHOOT ANYBODY THAT TRIES TO TAKE MY PRISONER. YOU PEOPLE, PUT AWAY YOUR WHISKY AND GO ON BACK HOME WHERE Y'ALL BELONG. YOU UNDERSTAND? [OWLS HOOTING] [GROANS STIFFLY] ARE YOU JUST GOING TO LEAVE YOUR GUN LAYING THERE? YUP. HOW DO YOU KNOW I WON'T USE IT AGAINST YOU? YOU WON'T. AND WHY'S THAT? BECAUSE THAT IS NOT MY ONLY GUN, AND I HAVE A KNIFE IN MY BELT, AND, WILL, IF YOU EVER THINK ABOUT DRAWING ON ME, THAT'LL BE THE LAST THOUGHT YOU EVER HAVE. YOU GO TO SLEEP. I GOTTA FINISH THIS CHAPTER. WHAT'S IT ABOUT? ADVENTURE. I LIKE GOING PLACES, EVEN IF IT IS IN A BOOK. IS THAT WHY YOU LEFT HOME? ADVENTURE? NO. I READ DIME NOVELS FOR ADVENTURE. WHERE DID YOU MEET MY MOTHER? CHICAGO. SHE WAS PERFORMING AT THE STATE STREET THEATER. SHE WAS WONDERFUL. I, UM... BOUGHT A TICKET EVERY NIGHT FOR A WEEK UNTIL SHE AGREED TO, UH, HAVE DINNER WITH ME. YOU KNEW HER BEFORE I WAS BORN. YES. IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. WE SHOULD GET SOME SLEEP. DID YOU CARE ABOUT HER? I DID. STILL DO. THEN WHAT HAPPENED? BAD TIMING, I SUPPOSE. YOURS OR HERS? BOTH. I'M GOING TO SLEEP. [♪♪] WITH TWO HORSES, I SORT OF THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE FARTHER AWAY. LEAVING WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HONORABLE. YOU DIDN'T LEARN THAT FROM DEKE SPRADLING. NO, MY MAMA TAUGHT ME THAT. AND YOU WAITED THIS LONG TO PUT IT INTO PLAY? BETTER LATE THAN NEVER. LAST WEEK WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER TIME. LIKE YOU SAID, TIME ONLY TRAVELS IN ONE DIRECTION. DID I SAY THAT? YOU CATCH ANYTHING? [WILL]: NO. I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SHOOT ONE FOR US. NO, I ONLY SHOOT FISH WHEN THEY'RE IN A BARREL, WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU AND I ARE GOING TO BE IF YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT I'M UP AGAINST WHEN WE GET THERE. I AGREED TO LEAD YOU TO THEM, THAT'S ALL. THIS ISN'T A SOCIAL CALL, WILL. HE'LL PUT A BULLET IN YOU IN A SECOND. I'M NOT GOING TO HELP YOU KILL THEM. I CAN'T. [GALLOPING HOOFBEATS APPROACH] CAN I HELP YOU? THANK YOU, MA'AM. I BELIEVE I WILL HELP MYSELF. IT'S MY PHILOSOPHY THAT A MAN SHOULD ALWAYS WALK INTO A ROOM LIKE HE OWNS IT. DON'T YOU AGREE? NOW, THAT IS A LOVELY BRACELET. YOU BRING THAT OVER FROM SWEDEN? NORWAY. I NEVER CAN GET THEM PLACES STRAIGHT. TAKE IT OFF. IT-IT'S NOT FOR SALE. I DON'T INTEND ON BUYING IT. HOW ABOUT THAT RING? WELL, THANK YOU. I'LL TAKE SOME OF THEM PIES FOR MY BOYS OUTSIDE. ALL OF THEM. [YELPS IN FRIGHT] [SOBBING] DON'T YOU FRET OVER THEM PIES. YOU CAN MAKE SOME MORE. I'LL COME BACK FOR 'EM ANOTHER DAY. JA. JA, JA... OR I COULD JUST WAIT HERE WHILE YOU BAKE UP ANOTHER BATCH. BY THE WAY, WHERE IS YOUR HUSBAND TODAY? HE'S AWAY. THAT'S TOO BAD. [CLUCKS TO DOG] COME HERE, GIRL. I FIND IT'S THE BEST POLICY TO TELL THE TRUTH, UNLESS YOU ARE AN EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD LIAR, WHICH YOU ARE NOT. I KNOW HE'S HERE. YOU'RE MISTAKEN. AM I? I COULD SWEAR I SAW A SHADOW IN THAT BACK ROOM WHEN I WALKED IN. YOU GET OUT OF OUR STORE AND DON'T COME BACK. THAT IS A VERY PERSUASIVE RIFLE. LOOKS A LITTLE OLD, THOUGH. YOU BRING THAT OVER FROM SWEDEN, TOO? NORWAY. [COCKS RIFLE] SVEN, DON'T! PLEASE... PLEASE, JUST GO AWAY. JUST LEAVE US ALONE! "PLEASE." WHY THANK YOU, MA'AM. NOW, THAT IS THE WAY CIVILIZED PEOPLE TALK. I WILL TAKE MY LEAVE OF YOU. IT'S TIME I BROUGHT MY BUSINESS SOMEPLACE ELSE, LIKE THE UNDERTAKER. [DEKE FIRES, SHE SCREAMS IN HORROR] [SOBBING IN ANGUISH] [♪♪] I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD READ BOUNCING AROUND ON THE BACK OF A HORSE LIKE THAT. APPARENTLY NOT. BE CAREFUL. IT'S BAD FOR YOUR EYES. YOU MAY END UP NEEDING SPECTACLES. YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT MY EYES NOW? JUST MAKING CONVERSATION. MY EYES ARE FINE. YOU EVER READ EMERSON? NO. "THE END OF THE HUMAN RACE WILL BE THAT IT WILL EVENTUALLY DIE OF CIVILIZATION." WHEN I'M OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, I SOMETIMES WONDER IF THAT ISN'T TRUE. HE SAY THINGS LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME? YEAH. I WOULDN'T MIND SEEING THAT BOOK. [♪♪] CAN WE STOP OVER THERE? I NEED SOME LINIMENT FOR MY HORSE. [COCKS RIFLES] ALL RIGHT, BE QUICK ABOUT IT. ALL RIGHT. MA'AM? PUT THAT RIFLE DOWN. MY NAME'S JOHN WILLIAM GOODNIGHT. I'M A PRESIDING JUDGE IN THIS TERRITORY. I REPRESENT THE LAW. NO LAW NEVER COMES UP HERE. IT'S HERE NOW. IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME, I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU MY CREDENTIALS. I CAN'T READ. WELL, I CAN SEE THAT SOMETHING AWFUL HAS HAPPENED. I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU FIND OUT WHO DID THIS. I ALREADY KNOW WHO DID THIS! WELL THEN PUT THE RIFLE DOWN AND YOU CAN TELL ME. YOU! Y-YOU'RE MISTAKEN. NO. NO, I'VE SEEN YOU IN HERE BEFORE. YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE SPRADLING BOYS! I SWORE... I SWORE TO GOD THAT IF ONE OF YOU EVER CAME IN HERE AGAIN, I WOULD KILL YOU, JUST... [SOBBING] JUST LIKE YOU... JUST LIKE YOU KILLED MY HUSBAND. YOU'RE A SPRADLING! HE'S NOT. HE'S MY SON. WHY'D YOU SAY I WAS YOUR SON? 'CAUSE THAT LADY WAS ABOUT TO SHOOT YOU. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY THAT. OKAY, NEXT TIME SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO SHOOT YOU, I WON'T SAY ANYTHING. MOUNT UP, LET'S RIDE. [♪♪] I MET AN OLD CHINAMAN ONCE. HE SAID SOMETHING TO ME I NEVER FORGOT. HE SAID, "HE WHO WAITS FOR ROAST DUCK "TO FLY INTO HIS MOUTH WILL GO HUNGRY." I DON'T THINK I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, SIR. BEST I CAN MAKE OF IT IS, AIN'T NOTHING GIVEN TO US IN THIS WORLD. WE'VE GOT TO HELP OURSELVES TO GOD'S BOUNTY. I'VE GOT A SHOE LOOSE. FRONT LEFT. CAN YOU FIX ME UP? SURE. IT'LL BE HALF A DOLLAR. A HALF DOLLAR? WELL... UM, SIR, I CAN'T MAKE CHANGE FOR THAT. HOW ABOUT YOU KEEP IT? THANK YOU, SIR. THIS YOUR FAMILY'S OUTFIT? NO, SIR, I JUST WORK HERE. I AIN'T GOT NO FAMILY. NO FAMILY... A RECENT LOSS? YES, SIR. BOY, WE SHARE THAT IN COMMON. ORPHAN... ME TOO. YEAH... THAT'S RIGHT. I LOST BOTH MY PARENTS WHEN I WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE. [HAMMERING HORSESHOE] GOOD. THAT'S REAL GOOD. SO HOW LONG YOU BEEN WORKING HERE? UH, GOING ON TWO MONTHS NOW. PAYS DECENT? WELL... MR. BILLINGS SAYS AS SOON AS WE HIT PAY DIRT, WE'LL ALL GET REWARDED. AND MR. BILLINGS, HE'S THE MINING BOSS? YES, SIR. WELL... I COULD WAIT AND TALK TO HIM, BUT... I'LL TELL YOU, SON... I'D MUCH RATHER TALK TO YOU. WHAT ABOUT? TWO MONTHS GONE, YOU AIN'T BEEN PAID YET. THAT AIN'T RIGHT. LISTEN, I RUN AN OUTFIT. I RECENTLY LOST ONE OF MY BOYS. HE WAS REAL GOOD WITH THE HORSES. NOW, I HEARD YOU WERE CLEVER WITH THEM. NOW, YOU HIRE ON WITH ME, PAY'S GOOD, ON TIME, AND YOU'RE WITH PEOPLE WHO TAKE GOOD CARE OF ONE ANOTHER. HOW'S THAT SOUND, SON? YOU INTERESTED? I'D RIDE OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW IF I HAD A HORSE. [CHUCKLING] YOU DO NOW! GO ON OVER AND PICK OUT ONE, GO ON. AND GRAB A GOOD ONE. I'LL LEAVE MR. BILLINGS SOME MONEY AND A GOODBYE NOTE. SO, WHAT DO I CALL YOU? HENRY'LL DO, SIR. HENRY. YOU CAN CALL ME MR. SPRADLING. IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO MEET YOUR NEW FAMILY. [♪♪] HOLD ON! THAT WAY ISN'T SAFE. THERE'LL BE ABOUT EIGHT AT THE HIDEOUT, BUT ONLY TWO YOU NEED WORRY ABOUT. SPRADLING AND BIG MIKE. BIG MIKE'LL BE POSTED UP OUTSIDE ON LOOK-OUT. HE'S DUMB AS A STICK, BUT HE'S GOT A SHARP EYE, AND HE'S GOOD AT PICKING OFF ANYTHING THAT HE SEES MOVE. SO, WHAT'S THE WAY? THAT WAY. WE'LL HAVE MORE COVER. WE SHOULDN'T GET SPOTTED. [♪♪] [WHISPERING] COME THIS WAY. THAT'S BIG MIKE. BEHIND HIM'S WHERE WE HOLE UP. HE'S DUMB, RIGHT? DUMB AS A STICK? DUMBER. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO TELL ME? NO. YOU SURE? I'M SURE. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO TELL ME? THERE ARE A FEW THINGS. ANOTHER TIME. THERE'S SOME MONEY IN MY SADDLEBAGS, WILL. IF I DON'T MAKE IT BACK, YOU TAKE THOSE HORSES, AND YOU GET OUT OF HERE. GET WORD TO YOUR MOM THAT YOU'RE SAFE. SHE'S WORRIED SICK ABOUT YOU. YOU'RE LETTING ME GO? YOU LED ME TO THEM. YOU SAID YOU WOULD. I JUST... DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO KEEP YOUR WORD. MAYBE YOU NEED TO RAISE YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF PEOPLE A LITTLE BIT. MAYBE I WILL. I HOPE I SEE YOU AGAIN, WILL, BUT IF I DON'T, TAKE THIS SECOND CHANCE. YOU DESERVE IT. HEY, BIG MIKE! WHO'S THAT? IT'S ME, HORACE. HORACE? BUT YOU'RE DEAD. IF I'M DEAD, HOW CAN I BE TALKING TO YOU? QUIT MESSING AROUND! GIVE ME A HAND UP BEFORE I DOCK YOU A DAY'S PAY. OOF! WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' DOWN HERE, MIKE? YOU'RE ON WATCH. [COCKS GUN] MIKE'S EYES ARE CLOSED AT THE MOMENT. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SHOT MY BROTHER. YES, I AM. YOU'RE THE ONE THAT LEFT HIM TO DIE IN THE STREET. PUT THE RIFLE DOWN. AS YOU WISH. [SHOTS BLASTING] [TRADING GUNFIRE] [GUN CLICKS, EMPTY] [SHOTS BLASTING] YOU'VE GOT TO COME OUT, SPRADLING. I'LL BURN THIS BARN DOWN AROUND YOU. [SPRADLING]: I GUESS WE'D BETTER JUST RUN. BOYS, INTRODUCE YOURSELVES. THEY'RE NOTHING MORE THAN CHILDREN. QUITE THE CONTRARY. STEP ASIDE, BOYS. YOU'VE GOT YOUR WHOLE LIVES AHEAD OF YOU, AND YOU DON'T NEED TO DIE TODAY. DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, BOYS. HE JUST WANTS TO COME BETWEEN OUR FAMILY. WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE! A PITCHFORK? A GUN WOULD BE MORE OF A THREAT. OF COURSE, HE'LL NEVER LET YOU GET YOUR HANDS ON ONE, 'CAUSE HE KNOWS, ONE OF THESE DAYS, YOU'RE GONNA TURN ON HIM, AND YOU WILL. WHEN YOU REALIZE WHAT A LYING, MURDERING PIECE OF DIRT HE IS. WE'RE A FAMILY, AND WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF YOU! THAT'S MY BOY... FAMILY? HE WOULD PUT A BULLET IN ANY ONE OF YOU IN A HEARTBEAT. YOU'RE WRONG. YOU THINK SO? WALK AWAY AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. [COCKS PISTOL] [PANTING IN FEAR] EASY... HOLD FIRM, BOY. I CHANGED MY MIND. I WANT TO GO HOME. SHH... YOU ARE HOME, HENRY. LET HIM GO. I'D SOONER SEE HIM DIE BY MY HAND THAN BY THE ROPE OF A LAWMAN. AND I WILL TAKE THE LIFE FROM THIS BOY, AND EVERY ONE OF THEM TILL IT'S JUST YOU AND ME. NOW, YOU TOSS OUT THAT GUN. GO ON, TOSS IT OUT. NOW! GOOD. NOW, COME ON OUT. WILLIAM. IS THAT YOU, SON? I HOPED YOU'D FIND YOUR WAY BACK TO US. YOU BRING THIS LAWMAN HERE? YES, SIR. HE'S MY GIFT, TO YOU. WELL, I DO APPRECIATE GIFTS. YOU COME ALONE? YES, SIR. YOU FLYIN' STRAIGHT WITH ME, BOY? YES, MR. SPRADLING. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, SON. REAL GOOD. I'D NEVER HURT MY BOYS. NEVER. I JUST HAD TO BLUFF HIM OUT. ALL RIGHT, GO ON AND TELL HIM. I'D NEVER HURT A SINGLE ONE OF YOU. GO ON! GO ON, TELL HIM! I'D NEVER HURT A SINGLE ONE OF YOU! [MUTTERING OBEDIENTLY] YOU'D NEVER HARM ANY OF US. SEE? YOU'RE HOME, HENRY. YOU'RE HOME. GO ON, WILLIAM, CHECK HIM FOR WEAPONS, AND BRING 'EM BACK TO ME. YES, SIR. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS, WILL? LIKE HE SAID, WE'RE A FAMILY. YEAH... FAMILY. PACK UP. WE RIDE OUT. NOW! YOU SPEND A COUPLE DAYS WITH ME, YOU THINK YOU KNOW ME? I DO KNOW YOU. HELL, YOU'RE JUST A STRANGER TO ME. HE'S GOT AN INDIAN KNIFE. LET'S GET MOVING, WILL. THIS IS GOING TO END BAD. FOR YOU. WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOTHER? YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT HER? THINGS HAPPEN. HERE'S HIS KNIFE. KEEP IT. I'LL TAKE THE PEACEMAKER. YEAH, YOU WILL. NOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING, WILLIAM? WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE DAY I MET YOU. YOU AIN'T GOT THE GUTS IN YOU. YOU STOLE MY LIFE! YOU HAD NO LIFE! I HAD ONE. NOW I'M TAKING IT BACK. GO ON THEN, SHOOT. DON'T DO IT, WILL. DON'T DO IT. I KNOW YOU WANT TO, BUT IT DOESN'T FIX ANYTHING. IT JUST STARTS THE MISERY. IT MAKES YOU A MURDERER, A CRIMINAL, AND THEN I GOTTA DEAL WITH YOU. [CACKLES TRIUMPHANTLY] I'D RATHER DEAL WITH THE REAL CRIMINAL. RIGHT HERE. RIGHT NOW. AND I DON'T NEED GUNS, AND I DON'T NEED TO HIDE BEHIND A BUNCH OF LITTLE KIDS. [LAUGHS] WELL, I DO BELIEVE I'M GOING TO ENJOY THIS. [BLOW LANDS HEAVILY] [SPRADLING LAUGHS] [GROANING IN PAIN] [CACKLES] [LANTERN SHATTERS] [LAUGHING] HEY! A BLANKET! [LAUGHING] [BLOWS THUD HEAVILY] [GROANING IN PAIN] BOYS, IF YOU FOLLOW A MAN LIKE THAT, YOU'LL MOST LIKELY END UP THE SAME WAY. BUT YOU CAN TAKE A DIFFERENT PATH. MAKE A CHOICE ABOUT THE KIND OF MAN THAT YOU WANT TO BE IN THIS LIFE. MAKE THAT CHOICE NOW. ONCE YOU CROSS THE LINE, THERE AIN'T NO GOING BACK. [SIGHS SADLY] I'M HENRY, SIR. HENRY. I'M JOSEPH, AND I'M VERY SORRY FOR ALL THE WRONG I'VE DONE. WE ALL ARE. THIS IS COOPER. AND THIS HERE'S ROY. WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT'S YOUR NAME? I'M BILL, SIR. I DONE WRONG, TOO. WELL, HOW OLD ARE YOU, BILL? 12, I THINK. I DON'T RIGHTLY REMEMBER. WHAT DO WE CALL YOU, SIR? JUDGE'LL DO. THEY'RE COMING! [♪♪] I'M SORRY, MAMA. OH, I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HOME. WELL, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR A LONG TIME. YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST KILLED ME WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE. YEAH, THE KILLING IS WHAT YOU DO. YOU'RE GOING TO BE JUDGED BY THE LAW. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? DEAD IS DEAD. THE DIFFERENCE IS JUSTICE. YOU'LL KNOW IT WHEN YOU FEEL IT SQUEEZING AROUND YOUR NECK. [HARD SLAP] THAT'S FOR ALL THE MOTHERS WHOSE SONS YOU TOOK. I SAVED THEM BOYS. WILL, TAKE THOSE BOYS OVER TO THE LIVERY STABLE. TELL THEM TO BED DOWN THERE FOR THE NIGHT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO, BOYS. ARE YOU BOYS HUNGRY? [ALL REPLYING WITH ENTHUSIASM] WELL, WE BETTER FEED YOU, THEN. ALL RIGHT... YOUR HONOR... THAT CAN'T BE A GOOD IDEA. THEY'RE CRIMINALS. THEY'LL RUN AWAY. THEY'RE JUST BOYS. THEY DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO. I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU, HOWEVER, COUNSELOR. YOU AND I HAVE A LITTLE UNFINISHED BUSINESS. THIS COURT IS IN SESSION. JOHN WILLIAM GOODNIGHT PRESIDING. STEP UP TO THE BENCH. YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS. DON'T MAKE ME USE THIS. [SCOFFS] YOU'RE INSANE. POINT WELL TAKEN, BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOU OWE THAT LADY $50 IN REPARATION. FOR WHAT? MALICIOUS DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, TRESPASSING, VANDALISM ON HER PERSONAL DOMICILE. YOU HAVE NO PROOF OF ANY OF THAT. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU SAW OR HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF MR. BREED ENGAGING IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY PERTAINING TO THE PROPERTY IN QUESTION. AH! RIGHT THERE. GUILTY. AND KICK IN ANOTHER 10 FOR HER PAIN AND SUFFERING. YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE LAW. I AGREE. BE SURE AND WITHDRAW THAT MONEY FROM THE BANK BEFORE SOMEBODY ELSE ROBS IT. I'LL HAVE THE SHERIFF ESCORT YOU. THIS COURT IS ADJOURNED. RIGHT THIS WAY, COUNSELOR. [KNOCK ON DOOR] CAN I COME IN? JOHN, I READ SOMETHING ONCE, AND IT STAYED WITH ME, "IF FRIENDSHIP IS STRONGER THAN LOVE "AND LASTS LONGER, THEN LET US BE FRIENDS." THANK YOU FOR BEING MY FRIEND AND WILL'S FRIEND. DID YOU JUST QUOTE SHAKESPEARE TO ME? BUT I CAN. "OH, WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE, WHEN FIRST WE PRACTICE TO DECEIVE." I WISH I HAD TOLD YOU 16 YEARS AGO. WIRES HAVE BEEN SENT OUT TO TRY TO LOCATE YOUR NEXT OF KIN, SHOULD THERE BE ANY. THEY'LL PICK YOU UP AT THE UNION PACIFIC OFFICE IN CASPER, WHERE YOU WILL BE LEARNING A TRADE. CAN ANY OF YOU READ?

YOU WILL MAKE SOMETHING OF YOURSELVES, AND IF ANY OF YOU DISAPPEAR OR DROP OUT, WHETHER YOU'RE 18 OR NOT, I'LL FIND YOU, AND I'LL PROSECUTE YOU TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? YES, SIR. YES, SIR. ALL RIGHT, STEP UP HERE, SIGN YOUR NAME. IF YOU CAN'T WRITE, JUST GO AHEAD AND MAKE AN "X." JUDGE, IF IT'S ALL RIGHT BY YOU, I CAN EMPLOY ONE OF THESE BOYS TO WORK MY STABLES. I'LL DO IT, MA'AM. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? HENRY. WE'VE GOT THREE HORSES, HENRY, AND A NEW FOAL. GOOD. I HAVE DEPUTIZED THESE CITIZENS HERE, AND THEY HAVE AGREED TO ESCORT YOU BOYS TO CASPER.

[FLASHBULB POPS] WELL, YOU THINK IT'S TRUE? YOU LOOK A LITTLE BIT LIKE ME. OF COURSE, I'M, UH, BETTER LOOKING. [LAUGHS] WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU LOOKED IN THE MIRROR? OH, YOU GOT A SMART MOUTH. YOU KNOW, YOU COULD BE A LAWYER. I DON'T LIKE LAWYERS. NEITHER DO I. YOU COULD BE A JUDGE, THOUGH. [CHUCKLES] I DOUBT IT. THINGS HAPPEN. THEY SURE DO. SO YOU STILL THINK HE'S NOT YOURS? HE'S NOT MINE. HE'S NOT YOURS ANYMORE EITHER, CALLIE. WILL'S HIS OWN MAN NOW. I THINK HE'S GOING TO MAKE YOU PROUD. YOU'RE A GOOD EXAMPLE. I HOPE HE TURNS OUT LIKE YOU. ME AND YOU... WE NEVER DID HAVE THE BEST TIMING, DID WE? MAYBE THERE'LL BE ANOTHER TIME. I'LL HOLD YOU TO THAT. REMEMBER, YOU CAN'T LIE TO ME NOW. I'M A JUDGE. I WILL BE THINKING OF YOU. YEAH? GOOD THOUGHTS OR BAD? BAD MOSTLY. HERE YOU GO. GOT HER, WILL? YEAH. ALL RIGHT. [GROANING WITH EFFORT] WILL... IF YOU EVER FINISH THAT, LET ME KNOW HOW YOU LIKE IT. THANK YOU, SIR.
