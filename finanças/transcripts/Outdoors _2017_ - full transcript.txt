Do you want to do a tour and then go into details? Does it include the changes we discussed? Most. Whether the floor is parquet or concrete is irrelevant now, I can change that with the touch of a button. Let's go over the crucial stuff. Okay. Unreal... Do you need a moment? Yes, just a sec. Is that me coming home from work? Yes. maybe... It could also be a guy from the bank. If you don't make your mortgage payments. So this is the 37 square meters? - Yes. Okay. - It looks great. Listen, you don't have to decide right now how many kids you'll end up having. Thanks... No, no... But in order to move on, we need to decide how to divide the rooms. If we count the security room and put bunkbeds in Noni's room then... e can have six kids. Why not mattresses on the floor, too? Wait, no... seven, if one kid sleeps in our room. Don't look at me, talk to the lady in the kitchen. You know what? Forget the kids. There's no way of knowing what your needs will be when you're 60, either. Try to think ghat's right for you now, otherwise there'll be no end to it. I can make you 20 models, you pay me enough, but in the end we'll have to build only one house. That's too bad. Coffee, anyone? I'm going to make some. No thanks. You sure? - Water, I'd like some water, please. Great How do I make this thing move? - No, don't touch it. Let me play around with it. Gili... Hello there. - Well, hello there yourself. How about going up to the bedroom to think it over? Think what How many kids we'll have. No, the sink is full of dishes. They won't wash themselves, you know. They won't g® anywhere, either. Actually, I probably should sleep on it. Great. What's that in your bag? I'll show you in a mimute, baby. So, what do you say? Gili... What? Let's tell Daniel we need a few more days. Come on, babe, we said we'd come up here for the weekend and settle everything. Then let's just stay one more night. Come on, the house will be amazing, I promise. I want to get a few more opinions. Maybe show it to some more friends. What for? So they'll come live with us? I actually consulted with a few people, with... Benny Erez. Who? Don't you remember? Our stingy landlord on Frishman st. Who didn't want to fix the water heater. His name wasn't Benny. - Whatever. He told me to remind you of his shower. Really? Yeah, he said, hot water is supposed to come out brown, it's a pipe thing, that's the way it is. Who else did you consult with without telling me? Oh, loads of people. - Really? The old lady on Ben Yehuda st. Shoshi. Right, Shoshi. What a woman... She's not dead yet? No, she'll never die. She told me to remind you about the formica countertop and the... huge closet that blocked our entire bedroom. Did she say anything about there being no light in the apartment? Why? S dark bad? No. Who else did you talk to? A few others. Maybe after breakfast? Okay. It's great. Really? It's written so good you have to send it already. The new scenes I added didn't seem like too much? Which ones? Didn't you just read it? I didn't know there'd be a test afterwards. It's great. You have to send it. You'll get a budget for this. Maybe I should just delete them? No, not again. You've worked on it enough. Want me to press "send"? A budget, I'll build you a pool here. Yeah, right... You'll never build me a pool. You'll see. Let's go to the tent. I'll pay him, honey. What's wrong? I can't find the money. You're kidding me. I gave you the envelope, you put it in your bag. I know, but I can't find it. T's not here. Was the car locked? Answer me! - Yes, Gili, it was locked. Then maybe you left it at home? - No way. You gave me the envelope and I put it in my bag. Let me take a look. You think I don't remember? - Let me look! Okay, chill. When we left the gas station... Move. Here it is. It's all good. Youssuf agreed to do the whole work for free. Com'on.. He went to take a look at another house. He'll be back in an hour. Wanna sit on it in the meantime? I'd like to say a few words to Nehemia and Ruthie, may they rest in peace, who I didn't get to meet, unfortunately. First, to thank you for raising such a lovely daughter, and... thanks a lot for the inheritance you left her. Thank you so much. You guys help us far more than my parents do, So come visit... Let's go for a walk They won't take down the tree. I can't stay here anymore, It's giving me a headache. Com'on, let's go for a walk, Will we find our way back or should I leave a trail of banknotes? Come on. Look at this. Wow. What is this? Gili, be careful. There was no engineer with us when we built this. Come on. No way. I didn't build it on my own, but the chimney was my idea. There used to be a fireplace here. How come you never brought me here? I don't know. I knew you'd love it. How about I fix the place up? Have my study here instead of in the security room? Our house is not even done and you're already taking over more land? conqueror? Why? We'll have an extra room. Why should my study be in the stuffiest room in the house when there's such an amazing view here? I don't even need electricity. Just my laptop. All I need is a table and chair to write. Honey... Why are you stealing their drugs? Not nice. So how many guys have you brought here? This Juha, for sure. Juha?! Wasn't his name Juha? I have no idea who you're talking about. To me, all your exes are named Juha. Wait, I'm trying to count. I'm trying to remember. - Yeah. Oh my god. Gili, it's not like I imagined it. What are we gonna do with this ugly wall? Help me cheer Mommy up, okay? What do you think? You can't really see yet. I think the house will be pretty. She knows what she's talking about. We're here. How are you? - Fine. I'm so happy to see you. I love your dress Thank you. -Hello. -Hi. Gili? -Yes. Nice to meet you. - Likewise. This is Noam. - Hello. -Noni. -Hi. How old are you? - Seven and a half. Wow. I've known your mom since she was younger than you. Are you looking forward to moving here? Good, you'll have fun. You can go play outside without asking for your parents' permission. Yeah, Noni, we'll finally get rid of your leash. Look, this is a bit embarrassing, but you haven't taken the psychometric tests yet. But Gili went two months ago to the institute you sent him to. Yes, but what about you? I thought only Gili had to. No. Swear I thought only Gili had to. You know I was her teacher in junior high. Yes, I heard. So we have connections in the 'acceptance committee'. It's really easy. You'll get it done in no time. No problem. Oh, come on, Smadar. Why do I have to take this test? You guys know me. You think we'd let you start building, if we didn't know you? Everyone who's building is originally from here and they all took the test. "Explain what you see in the following picture in three sentences." It's a boy with a violin, isn't it? Want to color it in, Noni? - Stop it. What? This is bullshit. Listen, I'll save you the long drive. Let's sit here for 15 minutes and do it together, okay? I'll tell you all the answers. "Do you consider yourself a sociable person?" Come on, just fill it in. "Are you... an Arab?" Haven't changed, have you? It's not getting any easier. People are very happy you're building here. It was hard to say no to a price like that. That's it. Thanks. I miss your parents so much. Yeah, me too. So... what are you up to these days? I'm mostly building a house... And I recently finished my studies. Occupational therapy. Really? That's great. - Yeah. What about your art? I left it behind. I moved on. But I'm happy about it. I feel like a heavy weight was lifted from me. Lots of people here are all kinds of therapists. Yes, I know. We'll see how I fit in. - By the way, Remember Shani, Varda's daughter, who was in your class? Yeah, I know she's building too, their lot is around the corner. No. They switched. They'll be your next-door neighbors. What do you mean? The Genosars' boy backed out and then they switched. How can that be? I have no idea. If you had come to the meeting, you would've known. Did you pass? Sweetie, could you get my bag from the car? Yeah. - Thanks. You won't believe what happened. - What? The world's biggest bimbo is going to be our next-door neighbor. What? Why didn't we go to that meeting? You didn't feel like it. What's that got to do with it? If I had known, we would've also switched lots. Are you out of your mind? It's not funny, Gili. - Sorry Why didn't you tell me ®n the wa, y? I wanted... I wanted to tell you here. Are you sure? How late are you? Only a week. But I know it, I can feel it. But we have to check. I checked. And? An@l I'm telling you I'm pregnant. Come here. I'nji afraid it'll all be too much for us, you know? We'll be fine. Really. Can you believe it? All those people and machines are here for us? Yeah.. One hell of a production we've got going here. -Yes. Who is it? Hello? Who is this? What do you mean? Yes, I see. Oh my god, Gili. She's standing right in our bedroom. I'll nod and keep quiet. - Give her a chance. I must have looked so stupid... How did you get my number? Didn't they give you the contact list? - Oh, that's right. Hey. - Hi. Wow, it's been years. - Yeah. You look exactly the same. - Really? I never looked younger? She was like this in high school. Sorry, this is my husband Boaz. - Hi. -Hi. This is Gili.. My partner. -Nice to meet you. I'm so glad moved to this lot. Over there you had to build 28 steps to go up to the house. Damn. Now we have to replan everything. We got back from New York two years ago. O . How long were you there? Too long. It took me five years to realize I hated it there and then another two years to decide, until we left. I see. - Yeah... I never thought I'd come ba@k here. What about you? I also never thought you'd come back here... No, I meant, what do you do? Do you have kids? Yes, we have a daughter who's almost eight. Wow Yeah. She's totally wow. Wow. Do you have kids? No. We're trying. That's another reason we came back. Fertility treatments cost a fortune there. I really missed how people here talk about things openly. Yeah, huh? - Yeah. Well, welcome back. Thanks. They're building a prefab house, honey. Really? - Yeah. Aren't you scared? What, that the house will fall apart? We were also considering it but we decided to go on the safe side. Concrete blocks? It's just because everyone here builds like that. Prefab houses are very popular overseas. Yes, but it is more expensive because it's not as common. Not up for discussion again. Forget it. - Okay. The feeling inside the house is totally different. Yeah? Well... - What? What do you mean, what? You hardly know them, why are you taking over the plans for their house? No... Sorry. One, two, three... Daniel, can you come here for a sec? We'll just plant a few trees here. Maybe a climbing plant? It provides some privacy. But that won't solve the acoustics issue. Now? T's the OSB. Now. One, tw@... More? One, two... - More? One, two... - Good job. I apologize if it sounds stupid, but this isn't the view I thought we'd see from this window. No, it's not stupid at all. - Okay. There's no floor yet. Imagine it'll be 30 cm higher. Okay, I know. Still. Why can't we make this window bigger? Could you explain? - It's... It's possible. - Yeah? It's just... You know, a matter of time and money. Okay, time we've got. Let's see how much will it cost. How exactly do we have time? We need to close it up before winter. Then why did we build a prefab house? It's not concrete blocks, right? Give me a saw, I'll open it up. Seriously. - Look, we've already begun construction. So it means we'd have to stop, and make a change in your permit, submit it to the committee... For 40 cm?? - Yes. How long will that take? T could take months. Damn... We should've done the entrance like we first said and that would've made everything much more open. Gili, I'm serious. Don't treat me like a little girl! Daniel, what if we start doing the change and ask for a permit at the same time? Huh? I'm sorry, that's not the way I work. Before you get the final permit an inspector comes here to make sure everything was built exactly by the plan. I can't jeopardize my license. Can you please tell me how much it'll cost? I have to check, I have to see. It's work. I just want to get an idea. I'd say around 2,000 shekels. Then what's the big deal? No, wait. - I'm sorry. You misunderstood. 2,000 shekels is only for me. For my work. We have to change the plans. How about aluminium windows instead of wood? What... - It'll cost so much less. It won't be the same house. It'll be totally different house. Agree with her. It'll change everything, in terms of the insulation, the finish look. Are Marvin windows cheaper than Andersen? It's just brand names. You want to close things outside and open up inside... Look, in the end you'll have a house, you'll put your furniture inside, you'll live in the house for a while and see what your needs are. Get acquainted with the walls. Don't take it so hard. Really. When I bought a new car I was so stressed out about it getting scratched that I ended up scratching it myself just to calm down. It's... We don't have that problem with our car. Talk it over, make a decision and let me know. -Okay. As soon as you can. Okay, thanks. Thank you. I told you, once we move in, we'll get used to it. Gili, plt^s-e, don't ever say that again, okay? We've been planning every detail for six months. What happened? Now I can actually see it, and I want to make a few changes. It's not too late. What's the big deal? We don't need to. You just want to. What do you want from me? Let's net make decisions based en hermonal changes. You are a son of a bitch, Gili. We don't have the money for all these games. I know exactly how much money we have. I really don't want to go into this. All I wanted was to make the window bigger. If we start with that, there'll tee no end to it. E have a huge deficit as it is. Deficit? What are we, a factory? What doe® this look like to you? Good thing there's a roof already. Mom, Mom. No need to wipe your feet. We'll have wooden floors here as well as upstairs. Wow, sounds amazing. And to think of the cave you live in now... Yeah... and the thing is, everything you see here costs less than a lousy one-room apartment in the city. Depends which city. Yeah, that's true. They say the houses here will double in value within the next few years. Wait, I don't understand, where is the kitchen going to be? Noni, want to show Grandma where the kitchen will be? Yeah I don't know what it's like to have an open kitchen, but a window over the sink is a must. I don't know if I should go for the expensive pipes outside. If there's a problem in the future it'll be easier to fix, but... it means investing now in something that maybe... I don't know, I'm no expert. Okay, but I just explained it to you now. I have no idea. I really don't know what to say. What's the problem? What do you mean? I feel as if... you want to tell me something. If there's something on your mind, just spit it out. What do you want me to say? Look, I've lived in a simple apartment my whole life. Bedroom, balcony, livinq room. That's it. You're moving from a stuffy apartment in the city center to a palace in the nature. Okay. So? So I'm not like you, living on the ends of the spectrum. You're a dreamer. So I don't know what to say to you. Say... What's that got to do with the pipes? I don't know. You asked. Have I fallen into a trap? Let's just drop it. Your mother said you're working on a new play. Tell me how that's going. I'm not into all these heart-to-hearts. No, I don't want to drop it. Because actually... we wanted to ask you for some help. We need help, Dad. Ahh.. So it's you who's trying to tell me something. Noam! Mom, can I go to the playground? - Okay. Already made friends here, Noni? Yeah. Careful, sweetie, Don't run there. - Okay. Bye, Grandma. - Bye, honey. She feels at home wherever she goes. T's unbelievable. E told you we wouldn't be able to help. I don't know what to say. Ask Shiri. Maybe she can help. You're sending me to ask your daughter for money? What do you want? When I told you not to be a fool like me and to choose a job without a pension, you didn't understand. So are you punishing me for not listening to you 20 years ago? Punishing you? Once you realize the world doesn't revolve around you you'll be much better off, believe me. Is everything okay? - Yeah. I'm just a little out of it. Aren't you feeling well? Actually... No way. - Yes. I knew it. I felt it. - Yeah?-Yeah. But we haven't seen you in a long time, so I didn't want to... And you two always put on weight in the winter. No, we didn't put on weight for nothing... Instead of telling me, you're talking about mortgages? Don't start up with that. Everything will work out fine. Where's the playground? Take a left before you get to the gate. We'll be right there. Mom, don't say anything to Noni, we haven't told her yet. Bye. - Bye. She kept staring at my tummy. Was I supposed to lie to her? Was I going to hide it from them?! I just didn't wanted to do both things together. It's so unfair to put them in that situation. Unfair? He sent you to ask your sister for money. Were you eavesdropping? You know he helped them. He gave them a loan because he knew they'd pay it back. Do you want to go into hi-tech? E wouldn't be in this situation if you listened to me. I'm always willing to compromise. Maybe because you don't care. Hold on... I love what you've done with the house. - Thanks. It's amazing. - Thanks. Do me a favor, go tell Yaara. She needs to hear it. - Okay. How about a drink? - Sure. -Beer? Gitye m.e a Iwak. - C®m® ®.r., W;®r'k_wi't'h us. Gili, we can't return it. Come on. All lilsjlii't, t Like this? Like this? - That's it. But go lower. - Since you'll be sitting It's you'll be able to see the view while you're working Ah, okay. Pretend you're writing. Okay. That's better Hey, what's up, bro? Hey. What a surprise. Wait, I'll just mark it here. I was bitching that I can't see the view from here Hey, Ariel. Welcome. This is going to be my study. Nice Safest place in the House Yeah Hey. Good to see you, man You too bro How's it going? What did you bring? - Good stuff from the big city. Wow. Thank you. -Where's Gili? - Inside. Come on in. "A Room of One's Own"? - Yeah, by Virginia Woolf. It's about women's writing... But forget that, we all need a room with a door, right? Has a green cover? I don't know, I read it in English. You know what? I'll get it for you as gift. For your new room. Cool, thanks. When are we meeting for coffee? - Whenever you want. I'm going to Berlin next week, so as soon as I get back. -Okay. But we'll really meet this time. - Absolutely. Gili, come here! You guys can talk later. Hey. - Hey. Where were you? On the other side, behind the house. You can really get lost here... Looks like it's gonna be amazing. - Yeah? -Yeah. You didn't say you were coming with Ariel. You have no idea. The drive up here was amazing, he's so great. I hope he was driving because you're in no state to drive. 's a bank robbery, okay? A bunch ofjj&ys all dressed in black, black masks. They break into the b^nOnd yell: This is a holdup! _ook how nice it is like this. Wanna leave it like this? Within one minute he's telling me how the security room reminded him exactly of the new play he finished writing and that he's taking it to Berlin exactly next week. Don't start up with that, Gili. How is everything always so "exactly" with him? Stop it, Com'on... Look how many friends came to see us. Why did you invite him anyway? Is he fucking Rotem now? - Hey. Why are you being so nasty? Remember what you said the last time we left the theater? Need I remind you what you really think about his plays? He's been recycling the same garbage for years. Sounds like he wrote something interesting this time. Okay. Okay, people, there's a sublet waiting list. Who's interested? - Oh, yeah! Listen, I really wanted to tell you that I loved your play. The one you just submitted. I can't believe I forgot the title... How did you hear about it? I didn't hear about it, man, I read it. I was on the committee. Seriously? - Yeah. I really fought so they'd give you the money but they're just a bunch of stupid bureaucrats, I felt like a fig leaf that... Really? - Yeah. You know I don't give out compliments easily. I really think your work is brilliant, you just need to market it better. Don't be afraid of a little PR, you know? Okay. From afar You can't tell if you're talking about Chekhov or about tits. It looks the same. - Chekov... -Tits... Who's Chekov? Some guy. - Nobody. We were just talking about your man. Yeah, we talked enough about your man. It's okay. Really? - Yeah. What did you say about my man? - Stop it. That he needs to get his hands dirty. So you were talking about the house. No, more like politics. I told him that he's a brilliant playwright but a PR disaster. Unlike you, right? A PR genius but a mediocre playwright? Hey, chill. What's going on? No, it's okay. I like it, actually. What? He just said my man is a brilliant playwright. He didn't say it like that, you added the sarcasm... No, it's okay. You're right. I... I admit he's a better playwright than me. Come on... - I don't know if I'm mediocre, but he's definitely braver. Of course he's braver. You can't even say it to his face. He's standing right here. He did say it. - That he's brilliant. He said it before you came over with all your crap. Now stop it. Okay. It's all good, bro. I just wanted to thank him for being so generous and telling me that he gives his approval that my man is a brilliant playwright. Would you stop it? - I'm just thanking him. What's going on? It's okay, you're right. This is your home, and your home is your castle. Even if you haven't finished building it yet. We'll go get a drink. You are so embarrassing, it's unbelievable. Hey there... Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. Excuse me for a second. Do I need to remind you that you're pregnant? Do you know that I organized all this shit for you? For me? You think I don't know you? You did it so everyone would say what an amazing house you have. Good morning. - Good morning. Morning. How are you? - Fine. Where's Ali? - He's not here today? No way, we were suppose to meet here this morning. Then he didn t come. What do you mean? - He didn't come. Maybe he went somewhere else. You did not tell me that he called. Then what am I doing here if he's not here? But there's nothing for me to do here. So now it's my fault for trusting you? But what was I supposed to check? Oh, okay. So I drove two hours so you could say that you forgot to tell me that he called. Thanks. When it dries, it'l turn white But after the second layer it'll be even darker and then you'll say you're done You think I don't know that? - No we have to wait for it to dry and then you-N-see But it's too yellow No, it's white It's wet now when it dries, it'll be totally white I've been in this business for 40 years, but you come along and say, It's not white It is white. You chose white, it's white All right Yeah, but I'm already here. No, I'm not driving all the way back today. But he'll be here first thing in the morning. But I have to write, don't you understand? I don't know what to tell you. Bye What? Hi, Noni... What's up? No, I can't come home tonight. Because I need to take care of some things here. We'll continue tomorrow. Why don't you ask Mommy? All right, let's continue now. No, you start. That's all we wrote? Noni, we got a little carried away. It's supposed to be a bedtime story. You're gonna have nightmares. All right. Okay, so... the maids got really scared so they filled the bathtub with boiling water. Yeah, I'm here. Yeah, we said... Yeah, the water was real hot, but her pants wouldn't come off. Noni honey, can we continue tomorrow? All right? Let's think it over. Okay, my love. Good night. Bye. Thanks. What's the end of the story? It's not clear yet My daughter's princess tried waxing her legs and got into trouble. Your daughter. - Yeah. So, I've taken over your place, huh? Yeah, a bit. But if you've got nowhere to sleep tonight, it's cool. But you don't have to burn down the place, there's a solar panel on the roof. Wow, you guys are pros. He doesn't look like a homeless person. No, I'm from the new neighborhood, I'm building here. So you're one of the invaders. Yeah, I'm one of the bad guys. Hey, where's our little friend? Right here. Did you take our little friend? So, Where are you invading from? From the big city, from Tel Aviv. Babylon. Babylon. Yeah. It's really nice here. Did you build it? - Yeah. It's really great. What... what do you do? I've already been approved by the 'acceptance committee'. Not ours. I'm in theater, I write and direct. No way. Oh, com'on... Really. Yaeli, come here. Who put our little friend out on the balcony? We've found the person who's gonna get you out of this dump. Yeah, he may turn you into a star. Our friend here is a theater director. Really? They're exaggerating a little, but yes. -Com'on, do one of your scenes. She's our school's entire drama department. She only does monologues. What are you, shy? Get up. Forget it, I'm not doing anything. "You have touched it at last: "that bridal bed. "Unspeakable, "horror of son and mother mingling: "Their crime, infection of all our family! "O Oedipus, "father and brother!" I also remember parts from "Uncle Vanya" if you'd like to hear. What?! You're crazy... Yaara? 'm Coming! What si® y®u think? I don't know. They're both nice. Which ©ne is mere expensive? I'll give you tooth for the same price. Great. Wanks. T	J You just have t® make up your mind. I'll call my husband, okay? - Sure. -I'm sorry. No Problem No, because he'll let us have both for the same price, so it doesn't matter. I don't understand, don't you... There's the kind we saw at Toby and Michal's house and there's the other kind that's more... Sandy like... the sesame tiles... I know they're similar, that's why it's hard to decide. Why... Fine, thank you very much. Cool. He's not answering, so I'll wait a little, okay? For him to call me back. - No problem. Why don't you decide? - No, sweetie, I can't Of course not. I have some more work in the neighborhood here I'll go finish up there. - Okay. 'll come back lat-e and hopefully Miki will give you an answer. Gili... - Okay? -Sure. You can also just send him a picture on WhatsApp Thank you. - Send him a WhatsApp. Thank you. - You're welcome. Yaara? Wow. Oh my god... No way. I don't Relieve it. - I don't teoliove it. Yaara? Sweetie. - It's been years. This is so great. Nice, Congratulations. Yeah, I'm pregnant, in case you didn't notice. I don't always look like this. Wow. Are you back in Israel now? Just for a visit. - A visit. -Yeah. I stole my parents' car, just like old times. -Totally. My sister's building a house here, so I came to see. -Where? Down there. For a minute I thought you were building here and it really scared me. Why? You have no idea what's going on here. Oh, you're building here? Really? Who would have ever believed? Where? - That one, over there. That's ours. It's nice. -Yeah? - Yeah, looks nice. Want to go take a look? Yeah, yeah... Is this a bad time? - N®, n®... was just checking something. We could do it tomorrow if it's a problem. Oh, so you already live here? No, we haven't moved in yet, but I'm here now. I'm staying in a cabin, dealing with all the house stuff. Don't want to do all the driving. Wow, Yaara... Guess when's building here. - Wk®? My future neighbor, Shani Cohen-Tzede’k. No way: Shiani? You're kidding me. I wouldn't make something like that up. - No, (I'm sure you'll get along)great. - Yeah? It's okay, she's better now. - Oh my god... Life has slapped her around and set her straight. With those kinds of neighbors, why were you scared I might be building here, too? Sounds like a great idea... Because then something would have to happen between us and I'd have to start coming up with excuses, walking the dogs, seeing what you're up to, if you're at home... That would seem suspiei®us. Dogs run around here free, remember? Yeah, I'd have to come up with something else... I'm just kidding, do I look like I'm up for anything? You'll have to wait till after I give birth. I'm not up for anything right now. Is this your first child? Second. A girl or a boy. We decided not to know. Do you know who the father is? Yes, I do. - Okay. His name is Gili. Gili. No way. I can't believe it. They're so blonde. - Cute, huh? -Unreal. Wait a minute, wait a minute. If I'm not mistaken, our hangout is over there, right? No, it's over that way. Didn't you go see it? Maybe it's been torn down? Let's go see. I can't, I have to wait for the floor-layer. (in Dutch) Hey, sweetie. Where are you two? (in Dutch) Then come here. Call me when you get here. Ziv Levy, very impressive. Very impressive. Can you believe that? Yeah. Wow. Could you help me with something? Sure. But promise not to laugh at me. Cool. - Cool. You bastard. You can stand not knowing if you have a boy or a girl but you can't decide between these two? Just point to one of them. Hold on. (in Dutch) I like the one with the dots better. (in Dutch) Me too, sweetie. (in Dutch) Dafna, do you want to try to say that to Yaara in Hebrew? Yeah. Yeah? Hey. What's up? Noni's Horne already? No, nothing. I just wanted to tell you, we'll go with the sesame tiles. Okay. Great, okay, bye. You want one like this? -Yes. - Yeah? Yes? Can I help you? Yes, maybe. I'm looking for whoever lives here. You found him. Hi, I'm Amos. I'm in my socks. Okay, sorry. I just... I used to live here. My family, that is. I'm Ya'ara, nice to meet you. Oh, Ruthie's daughter and... And Nechemia, right. I heard you were building here. This is very nice. Yes, it's... I built myself a study. Really? Would you mind if... I took a look around? Of course not, no problem. Wait, I'll put on my shoes. - Okay I know it must sound silly, we're considering different ideas for our construction plans so I wanted to get... - Why is it silly? Go right ahead. Know that you renovated the interior, but I'd still like to get a sense of the space... No, we didn't. It's all pretty much the same. Really? I understood from my uncle Tzuki that.. When we bought it, we thought about it, but you know what plans are for. Yes. Why haven't we seen you here? - No... I left, my uncle took care of things. Before we... can I take a look at the backyard? Because we want to design a laundry area. Yes, sure. Of course. Is that drying rack still there? Listen... The house is open, feel free to go on in. I'm going back to my hiding place, okay? - Thanks, yes. And if you need anything, you know where to find me. Okay. Bye, see you. - Bye, thank you. Great. - Excellent. Here you go. You'll be needing these. Thank you. - No problem. Congratulations. Do you have your permit from the fire department? -Yes. 'm not sure which one it is. Oh, and the electrician will come by this week to finish things up. Here it is. They were here and we did exactly what they said. You're supposed to have more sprinklers in a prefab house. But it's okay. - Okay. Do you have a key? Listen, I see lots of houses. This is one of the nicest ones I've seen. Thank you. But I'm in charge of the safety, I don't give points for aesthetics. Thanks anyway. That's it. Enjoy your new home. - Great. Thank you. - See you. -Bye. Bye. - Bye. We didn't notice that thing with the banister. Yeah, we need to... talk to him. We have to decide about the kitchen. Want me to call the guy? No, I'll deal with it. - I can do it. It's okay. Are they overdoing it with the sprinklers or... The guy's gone, you can stop playing this game. What game, Gili? Don't you think I want this to be over already? That's it, you can't talk to me anymore? Can't we talk without fighting? - I can. Yeah? - Yeah. Good, then what should we talk about? I have no idea. Anything. About... How did your test go? You already asked, I already told you, didn't I? Everything's okay. - Everything's okay? -Yeah. -good. I don't want to be this kind of couple, understand? No, what is "this kind of couple"? The couple that sits here in the living room staring at the TV without uttering a word. I can't. Physically, I can't. Can't you see it? Don't you realize we're becoming a cliche? Who cares? Who cares if I'm a cliche? Does anyone look at me? Do I have to prove anything to anyone? Who cares? - I care, okay? I care very much. - Hold on, let me get this straight. Are you sitting here in the living room or are you looking at the cliche couple from the outside? Maybe it's about time you decided if you're sitting inside or outside. Decide what? If you're sitting inside or outside! Oh, so you're firing me? Is that what you understood? -No. Because I thought I only need to decide about the racks in the bathroom and shelves in the living room. I wish you'd decide about the shelves in the bathroom and the living room. Look what you've become. You're boring! Am I boring you? No, you're not boring, you're insane. If you would've looked at me like you look at the door handles and tiles we wouldn't be in this situation. I don't care what color the counter is or how big the windows are! I don't care! I understand you don't care! - Good! -I know! Great. That's so typical. Of course. Everything here will just work itself out, right? All I care about is you, and Noni and that... Fuck this house, for all I care. When I told you I was pregnant with Noni, remember what you said? I was so happy. What's that got to do with anything? But do you remember what you said? "I'm so happy, this is so amazing." - No, no. You asked me if I forgot to take the pill. Okay, what are you trying to say? Well, I didn't forget. I didn't take it... On purpose. What are you saying? That if it was up to you you wouldn't have a daughter. Do you hear yourself? What are you trying to prove? That I know what's best for us! Things don't just happen. So now it's my fault that you're not honest with me. No, it's not your fault, it's my fault. It's all my fault. This whole house is my fault. If it were up to you, it wouldn't have happened. You're right. I'm a good father. Why would you say that? No one said you're not a good father. I didn't say that. I'm a good father like you chose a good carpenter? Do you even love me? How dare you ask me that now? How dare you ask me if I love you? You don't understand anything. Are you an idiot? I'm building a house with you. I'm going to have your baby. How could you ask me that? How dare you ask me if I love you? So you decided to test me and now you're firing me? You can't even look my in the eye and tell me that you love me. I'm right here. I'm not concerned now with whether I love you. What do you need? I need you. I really need you, I want you, and you keep leaving me alone. You're such an asshole. Enough already, I'm tired... So there's another room here? No, that's just another bathroom. For the parents. Maya, come up here! You have to see this. Com'on you dork, get down already! You're the dork... So what do you say? Think the other room is better. Yeah... It's a bit smaller, but it's much closer to the bathroom. You're right, I didn't think about it. Two logs? - Two logs will last the whole night. Yeah? - It's very economical. Heat up the whole area. - Great. The bedrooms, too. - Then we'll use it. It's great that you built it. Did you already book your accommodation? Only for the first few days. - Wow, you guys are so brave. With a baby... We're either brave or stupid... - Could you set this down? It won't fit here. It's... We can put the little sofa here and stick this over there. The bookstand's not supposed to be here, of course it doesn't fit with the bookcase. But we said we'd put it here. I don't know, I need to see it all.. Are you tired, little guy? How long will you be gone? - We bought a one-year open ticket. But our contract here is for two years. -Of course. Don't worry. We don't plan on coming back here any time soon. Look, we could put the sofa here, next to the fireplace... -Yes.
