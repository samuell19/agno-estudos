2600. The world was a different place then. Happier. Colorful. The Internet was new and exciting. We were all doing it back then. Going online. We worked for an Internet TV company. You probably don't remember it. Dave and myself went to ﬁlm school together. We decided that we'd produce our own show and review video games. It seemed simple enough. We had an Atari, Sega Genesis, a Nintendo. We liked video games. We liked movies. We would combine them into "The Game Room." It started off slowly. Nobody noticed. We just looked like two nerds making fools of ourselves online. But each week, we poured our hearts into video-game reviews. Telling it to people straight with no corporate sponsors or any advertising money to speak of. We just told it like it was. Then we hit it big. Our game reviews propelled us into the international spotlight. Along with all the demons that came with it. The drugs, the girls, the booze. We lived the nonstop, high-octane lifestyle that is being a low-budget, Internet video-game-review show host. We expanded our empire. Hired a posse. And built a state-of-the-art game-review laboratory and game-room headquarters. The money was coming in even faster than we could count it. Stock options, dividends. Billions of dollars. What we didn't drink or inhale, we spent on toys, boats, video games, and booze. 24l7 we were living in the fast lane, making the ﬂy game reviews, keeping it real. The Internet was our bitch. We invented this online game-review We wrote the rules. We could make or break a video game with a single word. Millions of fans worshipped us. The world was in our pocket. It all happened so fast, It was hard to believe at the time. It was as if someone had just unplugged our Atari. The screen went blank. The sound stopped. The money ceased to ﬂow. The fans turned on us, and we were banished. In the end, nothing was left but our shattered dignity, a few blurry memories, and the classic episodes of "Game Room." Welcome back once again, ladies and gentlemen, to "The Game Room." I'm Dave. That's Mark. Today we've got a story that winds a tale of deceit, disease, and deformations and all kinds of good stuff like that. Although we like to overdramatize our story, living through the rise and fall of our show was like a trip to the playground of hard knocks. "The Game Room" was an Internet television show that ran from November of 1999 to October of 2000. As you can see here, this is bitter beer face. In that time, we reviewed about 80 video games. If you missed them the ﬁrst time, you aren't alone. At the turn of the millennium, Internet video was still in its infancy. Had to have these layers where there were conveyor belts moving the opposite direction. The game play here is simply terrible. This game would have been really good had it actually been a good game. Dolphins are easing their way into our culture. Eventually, they want to overthrow us. In that year, we made "Game Room" obnoxious, objective, and entertaining. We made fun of the games that deserved it. We praised the games that were good. And we parodied everything else. There's no better way to offend everybody than when you pick an international sport. Tell them how much they suck at collecting mice. And most importantly, we enjoyed ourselves as we watched our company sink into the abyss of dot-com failure. I traded my Jaguar in for a blender. You still had to pay a little bit of the difference, right? Like 5 bucks or something. -10 bucks, yeah. -Yeah. The blender's pretty good, though. Good. Back when the Nintendo ﬁrst came out, the game they were going to package with it was called "Duck HuntII and "People Hunt." Not "Super Mario Brothers." "People Hunt" is a very rare game. We managed to get our hands on it through our connections. They only made about ﬁve of them. Then they pulled it off the market. We have some footage of it. I know you guys want to see it, so let's check it out. A lot of fun. Deﬁnitely get "People Hunt." Today, boys and girls, instead of playing "Duck Hunt," we're going to play "People Hunt." It's a new game. l really like it 'cause the graphics and the sound are so realistic. lt just makes me feel like I'm there. Level 1's the easiest level. It's the "Drunk White Boy" level. It's not too difﬁcult at all to shoot drunk white boys. How do you get the people to come out of the woods? Well, it's real easy. You just have to use the "B" button on your controller. It's your people call. Just hit "B" and you have... Free beer here! Get some! This controller doesn't seem to work as well. A couple broken ribs or something like that. It'll heal. No problem. A few beers. Whatever. We've also got some footage of "Duck Hunt," the not-as-exciting game that came on the same cartridge. Stupid dog. Where you use a plastic gun that shoots light. What's that all about? Let's show a little bit of footage of "Duck Hunt." As redundant as these two games may be, I still ﬁnd "People Hunt" to be the better of the two. The graphics were clearly better. And the sound and just the whole ambiance. It made it much more realis ic. It felt like you were really there. They took a lot of fun out of "Duck Hunt.II First of all, the ducks can't shoot back at you. That freaking dog. "People Hunt," it's much more open-ended. There's a lot more things that can happen. Plus, the peripheral on "People Hunt" was much better. You had that huge riﬂe, which is more fun, with the scope and all that. The bottom line is "Duck Hunt" is a great old-school shooting game. It's the benchmark standard of light games for the NES and any system thereafter. You should immediately run out and add "Duck HuntII to your video-game collection. Look at this packaging. This is a peripheral. It's beautiful. It's black. It looks real. And you even got the bipod. That and it's wireless. And you've got this thing here that holds all the... Extra rounds. I thought it was a penholder, though. 0h, maybe that's what it was meant for. So you could write down your score after you played. Get that guy. The guy who wrote us that e-mail. Him. Get him! The year was 1999, and the Internet was exploding. Hundreds of thousands of Internet start-up companies were appearing out of thin air. Our business plan said that we were going to provide viewers with informative, entertaining, and educational shows on a variety of subjects. It was time to ride the dot-com wave. The possibilities were limitless. Being able to broadcast to the entire world affordably was now a reality. in August of 1999. Our plan, like most other dot-cams at the time, was to run at a loss for a short w e and then to suddenly get millions and millions of subscribers, or viewers, through adverti 'ng money and subscriptions to start making money, to be a proﬁtable business. That was the plan. one tape deck, two employees, and a studio made from a converted conference room. We'll take a look at one of the fan favorites. At least I think it was a fan favorite. We got a lot of e-mail for this episode. This is "X-Men" for the Sega Genesis. What a lot of people don't know about "The Game Room" is that we weren't always billionaire video-game show hosts. We had a life before this. Actually, both of us, ironically. we met in Professor Xavier's school for developing our mutant abilities. For some reason, we both got kicked out. This is the ﬁrst time we're admitting this to anybody, so you guys should feel very special. Aside from that time I tried to grope Psylocke. I had a mutant power, and I had a cool mutant name. Everyone had, like. Storm and Cyclops. I was The Lush. And I used my mutant ability, which was to throw empty beer bottles at criminals and evil villains like Magneto. You did a very good job at it. I thought so. It was just a problem when you ran out of beer bottles. People criticized you for not having any more super powers. I could only carry so many beer bottles on me. A lot of people laughed at you. Kind of laughed at me. "Oh, no, it's The Lush!" But I had a good heart. I meant well. That's right. It was you. Damn! And when throwing bottles at people didn't work and I was usually being laughed at by the bad guys, I'd usually try to swear at them. Like "Double dumb-ass on you, Magneto." But that didn't work too well, and that's where I come in. They named me Pottymouth. That was my superhero name. Because I could defeat evil super villains with harsh language and basically any other mutant that came up to me. You want to show a little example? Watch out. If you're a weakling, you may not be able to handle this. Mere mortals have trouble handing this. Let's check this out. ...you, you...mongering ...faced asshole! Wow. You have been defeated by Pottymouth, you...cock! Here we are. This is "X-Men" for the Genesis. No matter what difﬁculty level you put it on, it's always hard. The game is always hard. Difﬁcult game. Not one of the best side-scrolling Genesis games. But it's the X-Men. It's just fun for that reason alone. You can punch the...out of each other in the Danger Room. And I was never too clear if we had actually left the Danger Room. It was never really that dangerous. It wasn't like we were stepping into Genosha or anything. Now, what happens is that during the game, you can choose a backup guy. 0r girl. The X-Men are not sexist. Not like we are. I think the X-Men in itself is a sexist term because they're not taking into account the women that make up and partake in the X-Men. Perhaps they should get a more politically correct term for the "'905" or "new millennium," being the X-People. I don't agree at all. I think you're completely insane. I do have to say that I love Genesis cut scenes. The earlier "C.G." The text and the 2-D sprites with a spaceship ﬂying over to the planet. -You got to love it. -They're great. Kids, you have to buy a Genesis if you don't have one. We have the inﬁnite life and level select going on here. It's beautiful. Fantastic. You're trying to get game footage. And Jean Grey comes here and supports you when Dave falls into a pit. Go see the "X-Men" movie, by the way. Obviously, we're doing this game in time with the movie 'cause we enjoyed the movie thoroughly. Just, really, how can you go wrong with Wolverine? It's just that cool. Any movie with Wolverine in it... You could make "Henry V" with Wolverine. It would kick ass. "Wolverine on lce." Sweet! "Sugar Hill" starring Wolverine. He'd come out and...up other ice skaters. People of Earth, I'm Dragneto and I'm here to destroy you. That's right, Dragneto. You've picked the wrong day to mess with Earth. For I amThe Lush. And I am Pottymouth. And together, we will destroy you. I'm going to use my Beer Bottles of Doom unless you back off now, bitch. You want some? Want some more? Come on! Give me all you got, bitch! Come on! Oh, I'm empty. You're empty. Mother...goddamn...bastard! This game harks back to the golden days of video games when everybody used to play games on this black box here called the Genesis. Now, ifall you little kids don't know what a Genesis is, you're going to hell. See this? High-deﬁnition graphics. Arcade quality. This, my friends, is not the modiﬁed Genesis. This is the original model that came out oh so long ago. I got this in eighth grade with "Altered Beast." I used to play "Revenge of Shinobi," and we have all these games, mind you. "X-Men" is the ﬁrst. Those games are coming. The ﬁrst Genesis game that we're doing in a long line of Genesis games. I know we've been all busy with Dreamcast. and PlayStation 2 is coming. Well, hold on. PlayStation 2': gonna be good. The Dreamcast kicks ass. However, this is really the pinnacle of video gaming. This is pretty much undefeated, so far, in video games. Even the PlayStation doesn't beat Genesis. This had games like "Strider." This had games like "Super Monaco GP." "Phantasy Star ll." "Sonic the Hedgehog." "Shinobi." "Phantasy Starr ll" through "IV." The "Shining Force" series. You always liked "Kid Chameleon." And "Streets of Rage." Plus, the cartridges made the little rattling sound. Can you hear that? That's pretty hype. If your CD does that nowadays, it probably won't work. But these babies still work. One more point I got to bring up. When I played Genesis, I love "NHL Hockey." My buddies in high school and I would play IINHL Hockey." We'd get mad at each other or at the game. And those Genesis controllers are most likely going to be hurled 20 to 30 feet across a room into a wall or at a person, and they would still work just ﬁne. You can't do that with the Dreamcast controller. I got an issue with that. That thing costs 40 bucks. It's got little LED screens and Rumble Paks. Actually, it probably costs more like $60 or $70. And you just can't toss it at each other anymore. You just feel guilty throwing nowadays controllers. You just feel guilty, but back then, you could even run over the system, and it wouldn't matter. Didn't you have a friend that backed over it with a car? And it still worked. Please! No more! Xavier...off. ...you for booting us out of your academy, man. It's all right, man. We may not be X-Men, but, damn, we kick ass. From the very beginning, our ﬂedgling Internet television station had a variety of shows. A very eclectic array of subjects from dance instruction to history and health and medicine to science ﬁction. We felt one type of show was severely lacking, which was a video-game review show. And I had been working at FromUSAlive as a technician and director and editor for a while. After college, I went to ﬁlm school. And that's where l met Dave. So we were friends and just decided over a few beers one night, "Hey, let's create our own video-game review show. How hard can it be?" We thought this was a good show idea for many reasons. One of which is that the video-game industry was exploding in the late '905. This is when the PlayStation 1 was really big. Dreamcast had just come out. The Nintendo 64 was very popular. Things were really starting to pick up. It wasn't quite as big as it is now, obviously. but this was a huge opportunity to reach these ml Ions of gamers and review the games they wanted to see. Welcome to the ultra-violent featuring... What was that word again? Hang on. I got to ﬁnd it. Melt-O-Vision with a little trademark symbol. Previously, if they had wanted to get a review, they had to go to a magazine and read it, and that was reading on a piece of paper and didn't get to see any motion. Here, we were able to suddenly provide viewers what the game looked like in full motion, complete with our smart-assed reviews. Our clever witticisms that we placed over these games. This is, as you can see, blatant "Mortal Kombat" rip-offs. Just shameless. Absolutely shameless. Look at the ninja outﬁt. You can just tell it's like three sizes too big for the guy. "Virtual On" Crack, because whoever designed the controls for this game was on crack. God bless this game! This is a good game in that you're able to shoot everything that moves. There aren't any of those stupid civilians that pop out of nowhere. "Ooh, heavy, heavy!" Bang! You're dead! "You were a heroine." Okay. She said she was on heroin. I might add they're virtua tennis characters and they play virtua tennis on a virtua tennis court with virtua tennis balls and a virtua crowd with virtua crowd noise. She's a D.A. by day. At night, she's a vigilante ﬁghting crime. Ho-bag by day. Ho-bag by night. It has to have a snow level. It has to have a lava level. It has to have a desert level. You're trying to get a whole lot of white things into a rocket. I'm not saying what the white things may symbolize. Then the rocket blasts off and gets high. We do have much better ideas than anybody on making video games. If we had the skills to make video games, we would pretty much make the best video games ever. But we don't. So we can only make fun of people and their hard work. Get him! Swim! Swim! The ﬁrst "Game Room" episode was recorded on November 7, 1999. And it was nothing more than the two of us sitting down at an old dinner table with one camera plugged in to a bunch of computers when we barely knew how to use any of the equipment. We hadn't developed any of the characters that we started adopting later in the show. This is it. We didn't know how many viewers we were going to get. We had no idea. So we just did it. It didn't cost much. Are we talking into the mike or to each other? Each other. Which is fairly evident by the high-quality imagery on-screen. So, are we recording right now? And it completely sucks. Well, welcome to the ﬁrst episode of "The Game Room" The ShDW has been months in the making. Months. We really hadn't developed our style at the ﬁrst episode. So, over time, we developed the whole technique of making our stupid, funny editing and using the bad music where it didn't ﬁt. And that brings us to one of our favorite episodes, which is "Joust" for the Sony PlayStation. Throughout the annals of time, as long as Uranus has been around, there's been games from back in the day. Today's is "Joust." One of the classic games from the early '80:. Quite frankly, one of my personal all-time favorite games. You're ﬂying around on big birds wielding sticks, trying to stab your opponent in the head. That is perfect. Really. That's at my mental level at any given point in the day. You have one button, and you just hit it really fast and ﬂy. Yeah. Let's watch the game footage. I got the footage for this episode off of the "Williams Greatest Hits" disc. One of the best values for your PlayStation. Especially if you love classic games. What a bargain! Because it has -- It came out in '96 or '97, and the graphics aren't all that special. But this game does have giant bubbles, like you see here, and really neat electrical effects down at the bottom. And a fembot. It comes with "Joust." It comes with "Robotron: 2084," "Defender I," "Defender ll," "Sinistar," and "Bubbles." We were discussing, if they remade this game today, what kind of animals they would use instead of giant ﬂying ostriches. Because ostriches are endangered, and they don't want to teach children in this P.C. era of Generation "Y" to go off and hurt endangered species. So we decided maybe they would use dragons made out of beer cans. 0r dragons that shoot beer at their opponents and then try to knock them off, which would be pretty neat. See, dragons, again, endangered. Komodo dragon. Perhaps I was thinking more along the lines ofa ﬂying midget with wings. There's lots ofﬂying midgets with wings. Those guys are not in any trouble of extinction. I saw a bunch of them last weekend. And they hump like rabbits anyway. so they're not going anywhere. Going back to the technicalities of the game, unless you're an idiot or maybe you just didn't grow up in the '80s like we did, but you push one button to ﬂap your wings, and your job is to make the ostrich's butt land on top of your opponent. Revolutionary, ladies and gentlemen. That kills your opponent. You don't actually use the joust thing. You actually hit them with your butt. So you'll see me in this absolutely ludicrous wave 4. I was getting my ass kicked. See.7 Someone's butt landed on top of me there. This game also has the revolutionary arm that comes out and grabs you. It doesn't give you the ﬁnger, unfortunately. Ladies and gentlemen, you might have noticed. I'm not talking as much as usual today 'cause I didn't enjoy this game as much as Mark did. That's 'cause you suck. Maybe. But perhaps it was the rudimentary game play or just the idea of giant ﬂying ostriches that turned me off. But now as I grow older and I consume a lot more of the sauce, it gets a little bit more attractive every time I see it. l personally didn't like this game as much as Mark did. From the get-go. I've played this game throughout my whole life. It never peeled my banana. I personally prefer "Gorf." "Gorf" is a good game. And it has absolutely nothing to do with "Joust." "Joust" was better. Because you're piloting ostriches with big staffs You have one button, and you're hammering the button real fast to make the wings ﬂap. It's a lot of fun because it's just mindless. Plus, you have these lava-type things, and they grab up at you. When you stab the birds, the pilots blink and go away. Then you have the eggs. You got to get the eggs before they turn into the people. These eggs are pretty cool because they magically turn into little joust guys. I've never actually seen a joust guy came out of an egg before. That's why I think this is pretty cool. Because you have these eggs and the joust guys come running out. The bird senses that they're out of the egg, and they must have some sort of telepathy going on. 'Cause then the bird comes back and picks up the joust guy. Yeah. Exotic locations. Deep space. Outside. "The Game Room" didn't go to any of these places. Let's go to "The Game Room" studios herein Pittsburgh... ...where we ﬁlmed all of the episodes of "Game Room." Right here. This is... Should be a historic landmark for the state of Pennsylvania. Maybe it will be. We're not sure. We're still petitioning. is the actual camera that was used to ﬁlm all of "The Game Room" episodes. And I'm pretty sure this could sell on eBay right now for a half-million dollars. Maybe double that if we signed it. Here we have the green screen that we would project all of our stupid "Game Room" backgrounds on. And... This is pretty highly advanced. It's a piece of painted plywood. Actually, four pieces of painted plywood, if you want to get technical. Things really changed for us when we got this green screen. No longer was it just a cheap studio. Now it was a cheap studio with a piece of green-painted plywood. It's kind ofa nice picture 'cause it doesn't have to be centered. The jambalaya of drugs. As "The Game Room" was running for its ﬁrst few months, we eventually did get a budget, which was $50 an episode. Which we'd usually spend on the game itself. Sometimes if we didn't spend the $50 on the game, for instance, if we reviewed an Atari game that we already owned, we could take that $50 and put it into our budget for the next episode and have a $100 budget. Now, with $100, we could do some pretty amazing things. Which brings me to one of the most expensive and extravagant "Game Room" episodes of all times. This is like the "Waterworld" or "Cleopatra" of "Game Room" episodes. "Sega GT." Yeah! That's right. Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink. That's right. That sauce is good. This doesn't look that hard. I'm telling you. We could do this for real. We probably could. We don't need to do video games. The steering wheel's a lot easier than the controller. Let's take it outside. Let's go. I'll take you in my car. All right. Let's go. To the car. Remember... Yeah! It's one of those weird days. Like when you walk outside and it starts raining antelope. It's weird. It's like "The Game Room" is actually going to give you a real, hard-core, in-depth game review today rather than just shooting each other with assault riﬂes and drinking beer and throwing it at each other. Which, granted, we're really good at. Don't get me wrong. That's going to continue. However, you're getting into one of my favorite genres of all times. The racing game. It's time to get critical. It's also time to give a lot of praise. "Sega GT" is a pretty kick-ass game. But it ain't perfect. Let's check out some footage here. I got a lot of things to talk about. A lot of improvements you can make like adding in the Subaru BRAT and the El Camino. Or at least the body styles so I could put them on my cars. Let's check out the footage here. The ﬁrst thing I want to point out is that about 5, 6 seconds into it, we had to shut down the music because it is horrible. It's like sticking ice picks in your ears and listening to... at the same time. It's really, really that bad. It's just unbelievable how bad the music is. Ever single Sega racing game that's ever come out since the Saturn days has just been... Terrible. -I don't get it. -The music. The music. That's what I meant. This is an excellent racing game. The driving is, for the most part, right on. Let's get the negatives out of the way here real quick. The interface on this game is really bad. You do eventually ﬁgure it out, but the problem is that, say you were trying to go sell a car. You win a car. You want to sell it. So you go to the car dealership. You go to the "sell" option. And you ﬁgure you'd be able to pull down a list of your cars and sell them off real quick. No. You have to go back to the main menu. Select that car. Get in it. Drive over to the dealership. Haggle with the businessman. And then get a taxi back. You can't even strip your cars and sell them for drugs. What's up with that? Here's the car dealerships. There's not as many games -- not as many cars as "Gran Turismo 2." But you do get to make cars, which is the key feature of this game. Here's the factory. You can pretty much do anything to this car you want. The key is that no matter what you do, it all makes a difference on how it actually handles. If you make a mid-engine car, you can feel the difference, as opposed to if you put a front-engine, 4-wheel-drive car. I did like the fact that I could name my cars. So I got to drive the Mach 10, the El Camino. the AK-47. The Mad Dog. These are all great car names. The reason "Gran Turismo" is a little bit better than "Sega GT" is generally the cars feel better. They handle a little more responsive. Also, you have a greater selection of cars. You have SOD-plus cars in the last "Gran Turismo," right? The tracks are ten times better in "Gran Turismo" than they are in "Sega GT." If you own a Dreamcast. absolutely buy it. You can build your own cars then bring them out in races. The races are extremely challenging. Yeah. But you'll be so preoccupied being able to make cars called the Subaru BRAT 2, which I made. And the Super El Camino and the Magic 8 Ball. These are all car names that should really exist today. And they're totally feasible, but some people, I don't know why they think Super Pimp, the car, should be illegal. I'm sure that every soccer mom wants a car called the Bad-Ass 8-Ball Shifter. Who wouldn't? Come on. You generally haven't played a cool racing game until you're able to break it down into such speciﬁcs as having 4-wheel drive with your front engine, mid engine, rear engine. It's not the greatest in the world, but it's fun. Did that make any sense at all? It made perfect sense ifl were listening. So go get "Sega GT," 'cause if you drove like this in real life . You'd die. Go. Yeah. This is a one-take wonder here. Special effects must be perfect. -You ready? -I am ready. You got to get all angles of these cars burning. It's great. Get the wheel bases. Let me just not catch the camera on ﬁre. Now, I really think "Game Room" was ahead of its time. Keep in mind this was in the days way before YouTube and AOL Video. In 1999 and 2000, we were doing game reviews of games that had been published And that was, I think, a very new thing. We were reviewing Atari games and Sega Genesis and Nintendo Entertainment System. "Frogger," "Joust," "Yars' Revenge." And I don't think anybody else was doing this at the time. "Anyone can read a professional review anywhere, but that's why you're better. It's more of a real review by seminormal people." -Now, that's debatable. -Very debatable. Sketchy, to say the least. "Besides, I'm pretty sure no one else talks over the game footage quite like you do, and they don't do classic games." Enough said. Rise from your grave. Dave and I were very nostalgic towards these games that we'd played as kids and teenagers. As he said in the "X-Men" episode, we did have plans on reviewing a ton of Sega Genesis games, which was our favorite video-game system, like "Altered Beast" and "M.U.S.H.A." We were going to talk about how "M.U.S.H.A." had the best music of any video game ever made, which you hear in the background right now. We had plans to do "Thunder Force Ill," a great shooting game on the Genesis. We had plans to do "Herzog Zwei," which was a groundbreaking game at the time. So many fond memories of games that we grew up with. Like "Berzerk" and "Xenophobe." And these are things we wanted to do and never got a chance to. There were probably two games more than I played any other game in my childhood. "Two games more than I played." Is that proper English? Who the hell cares? Here we have "Dig Dug." Yes, it was Namco. This is the Classic Game of the Week. People, it doesn't get much better than this. Dig Dug looks like one of the guys from "2001," doesn't he.7 He looks like Dave. Dave, I think this game has more violence than modem video games. He's literally blowing people up. Imagine how violent that death is. Look at that! Ouch! Think how much that would hurt. You only got 50 points for it. How lame. What good would a snorkel do you underground? It would be full of dirt. Maybe these people breathe dirt. I'll just say it now. "Game Room" was the ﬁrst to review "Frogger" online. Hands down. l think. Maybe. Frogger! Frogger! Frogger come destroy Tokyo! No! No, ribbit-san, no! That song is way better than "Copacabana." Much, much, much better. It's much more legendary. It sticks with you forever. Now, what does this game teach you, Mark? Well, this game teaches everybody, especially children, that if you don't cross the road really, really fast and in a strategic manner that you will most likely be horribly mutilated and killed. And your parents won't love you anymore. As you can see here, Frogger is strategically maneuvering across the giant blocks. And river. I've never seen a river with that much nit. Plus, check the current. It's going right in some areas and left in others. Strange. Only in "Frogger" world. Also, what kind of road is like that? I know. Maybe in Australia. I've never been there. Maybe it's an HOV lane going opposite directions. Speaking of the trafﬁc you see, you have Formula 1 cars. You have giant milk bottles and tractors all on the highway trying to kill you. And the tractors are going as quickly as the Formula 1 cars. So, you know, those are the kind of things you have to avoid when you're crossing the highway. This is the beauty of Atari right here, is the complete insanity of the game. It's all about fun. This was made in, what, 1982? 1981. And Frogger has to go jump. I don't know if you've noticed the white frog. There is some kind of mysterious lore. The white frog. from what my cousin tells me, is the chick frog. Yes, it's the chick frog. And Frogger gets laid by the chick frog, and it gives you bonus points. So there's your obligatory Atari sexual innuendo. If you little bastards haven't played "Frogger" before, what happens is that, the further you get along, you have to line up all your frogs in those ﬁve holes in the top of the screen. The more you do that, the faster the boards get and the harder things get. This is the third board, and we're watching Dave play. As you've noticed, Dave can't even make it across the street. As I was a kid, I was horribly maimed. But, luckily, aliens took me away and ﬁxed me. Now, I like the fact that Frogger gets near the water and can't handle water. He's a frog? Water kills him. He's a wuss frog. I understand if you get run over by a car, you're... But if you get wet, "Oh, no, water!" What the hell.7 Along the lines of big lizards, we have Frogger. He's a big lizard, too. Or a big reptile, whatever a frog is. It's not a mammal. I'm pretty sure of that. l think it's aﬁsh. Maybe a bird. Either way. it's probably pretty wealthy from all the money it made in the early '80: and is most likely married to a Playmate and sitting on a beach. So that's what happened to Frogger, I would imagine. But we saw the Atari version today. "Frogger" rocks. We can't say a whole lot about "Frogger" 'cause you all know about it. We can bring up certain points about "Frogger" that maybe you aren't too familiar with, like the theme of "Frogger" busting into other formats of media. lnvading the mainstream. Busting into movies and TV and whatnot. That's true. Granted, "Frogger" did have his own cartoon along with "Donkey Kong" and "Pac-Man." It was very inﬂuential about how people now cross the street and rivers. That too. For instance, "Gattaca." "Frogger" played a major part in the movie "Gattaca" where Ethan Hawke had to cross the road to Uma Thurman when he did not have his contacts in. Therefore he had to use skill, wit. That he learned in "Frogger." Like, when you cross the street, you say, "Hey! I'm only doing this because I learned it in 'Frogger', not because I need to get to the other side. Not because I'm following the chicken." But because you played "Frogger." I don't think that you guys understand exactly how proﬁtable "The Game Room" has become. We're on like a two-month paid vacation to Jamaica. It had to be because of the... "Game Room" started off pretty slowly. It took us a while to get our style down, to develop the characters that we eventually started playing throughout the show. I don't think either of us were really as dumb as we made ourselves out to be on "The Game Room." I hope we weren't as dumb. "Game Room" did survive the Y2K bug. And it was right around that time that an amazing thing happened. We suddenly started getting thousands of viewers and loads of e-mails. It was amazing to us that, all of the sudden, this hard work we had been putting into "The Game Room" was starting to pay off in the form of viewership. Now, we weren't making a dime yet with the show, but the potential was there, and we had been making them about two episodes weekly. three episodes weekly. This is something we could only do when we were about 23 or 24 years old. Both working 13-, 14-hour days. Going out afterwards to bars. Playing video games. Welcome to "The Game Room." Hi! We're live on location today from Luxembourg. It's beautiful and sunny. It's about 102 degrees here in sunny, beautiful Luxembourg. So we need to cool off with some margarita. Yes. Okay, let's do it one more. -Are you ready? -Yeah. There's like...in here, man. It's impressive that we had any viewers at all given the technology at the time, which was still primarily modem-based with 2400 baud or 4400 baud modems. People would watch the shows in these little, tiny windows on their computer. This was the beginning of all that. "Six Million Dollar Man" action. We were having a good time doing it. It's just too bad we couldn't make any money. and the cancellation of "The Game Room," we were still gaining viewers. So we never went backwards in terms of viewership. We were more popular than ever at the very end. Had we kept going, I really think we would have been more popular than "Seinfeld." No, we wouldn't have. Let's look at "Missile Command" for the Sony PlayStation. One of the older episodes. Pre-green screen. Welcome back, everybody. to another 8-ounce pony-bottle edition of "The Game Room." This is Mark and Dave. Me being Dave. That being Mark. And today we are going to do "Missile Command" for the PlayStation. "Missile Command" obviously stemming from the original "Missile Command." Obvious classic. One of the best games of all times. But "Missile Command" for the PlayStation did not have the trackball so you could roll your little cursor around. You couldn't do the DJ. move. And blow up missiles and stuff. I haven't seen that in a game, like a real game, in a long time. It looks good. I like to see that. Hasbro. Were they the ones that made G.l. Joe ﬁgures? How's you been, bro? I don't know. I don't remember. How's you been? This is the beginning of "Missile Command" here. They added some very nice animations in this game. Welike them a lot. It's quite nifty. We were impressed. Let's shut up. It gets better. Everybody be quiet. This is great. An alien ship of some kind. Greetings and welcome. Got taken to the new school, sucker. Here's the new interface, and you hear that there's nothing but fun music in this whole game. Here we have the "Missile Command" Newsbreak. This destruction of the world is brought to you by Hasbro. Makers of... Stuff. Yes. And here's the computer-animated sequence where we get to meet the stars of the game. That guy. There's that guy. This is one heck of a trio. -And there's that girl. -The hottie. The obligatory hottie. Wasn't there a show called "That Girl"? Maybe. Back in the day. Here's the spaceship taking off. There are the bad guys. Aliens that shoot missiles. The only aliens that shoot missiles. This is the game play of the... This is the game play of the new "Missile Command." They call it "Missile Command Ultimate." You have two versions in the game. You have "Missile Command Classic," which they've redone. You can't shoot that hot-air balloon. I tried a couple times. I failed. After your wave, just like the original "Missile Command," they give you your points for your cities and for missiles that you don't shoot. I'll bet those cities were hot property. It's right on the ocean. The difference between this and the old version is you can actually buy stuff with the money or points. Improve your ships. You buy new ships. Get breast implants for the lady. Wait. That's the other game. Sorry. This is Mark's favorite boss. This is the ﬁrst boss. This guy is easy. The third boss is the one I'm stuck on. They all pretty much look the same. They're cool nonetheless, because the bosses are a whole new concept to "Missile Command." As is the money thing. Yes. There are many new concepts incorporated in this game. He's blowing up. He's shaking. He doesn't know what to do. He's dead. Okay. It's a bad day to be on that ship. -And more action. -More aliens. There's that guy. And him! Here's a winter wonderland. That's about to get blown up. Have a very merry Christmas with "Missile Command" Okay. I'll shut up now. You have your main ship, which carries your special weapons and you. And you have these three other ships, which carry your three characters. That guy, that guy. and that girl. It's like Larry, Darryl, and Darryl. And here are your three ships blowing things up. They only hold a certain amount of missiles. You can't shoot that helicopter. She just yells at you. -She says, "You suck!" -The special weapons are fun. You get missiles that shoot two missiles. You can buy shields. You can buy extra capacity. You can buy more powerful mi siles. That was a great game. The format of the show is the same. We're talking a little up front about the game. Then we actually show you how the game is played. Give our opinions on the matter. When we did the 40-ounce bottle editions, we had too much crap. We didn't cut the crap enough. Now we're gonna cut the crap. Dave, we're full of crap. Our whole show is crap. We have a lot of crap. The animation sequences were kind of funny-looking. Yeah. They were kind of funny-looking. But the beginning intro scene was actually kind of cool, the way the director set it up. The way the three of them converged in the one hallway. The only thing that looks funny are the people in the animation scenes. The rest of the graphics are generally very good. I said before I'm not a big fan of digital people. Well, they're not a big fan of you. March 10, 2000. is considered numerically as the dot-com bubble-bursting day. That's the day the Nasdaq peaked. And it was pretty much a downhill ride. Venture capitalists were starting to run for the hills. It was obvious that Internet companies like ours were having trouble making money. We had invested a lot of money into trying to get as many consumers, or viewers, as possible and get advertising to them, which wasn't working very well at all. And at some point, you just can't keep spending without any return. So the writing was on the wall pretty clearly by about the spring of 2000 that we were most likely doomed. We still held out hope. We weren't gonna quit. We had put a lot into this. I think we had at some point 40 or 50 shows running "The Game Room" was becoming very popular with viewers. Welcome back to another edition of "The Game Room." We have a little trivia puzzle here for you of sorts. Which one of these penguins in the background is a "Game Room" fan? It's hard to tell. We were simply unable to capitalize that viewership into revenue. And you just can't operate a business that way. It was really moving and gripping. Dave? "Kasumi Ninja." How excited were you? How did it change your life? Changed my life by I got a little bit more sleep. I feel a lot better now. I feel like I have a lot more energy. Thank you. So the writing was on the wall. And... It was an interesting time. We really had to ﬁgure out what to do. We're supposed to be, like. moral-ish. Is that a Word? Is "moral" a word? -Moral? -Not that I'm aware of. Anyway, let's get to the game here. We do know this is a word -- "Draconus." Because somebody made it up. And Dave and I had a lot of long talks with the executives at the company. You know, we're gonna cut costs, change the format of the shows. How do we get more advertising? And I think that we took it to a more serious note at this point, which brings me to the "Seaman" episode. Which I think is the height of professionalism and serious game reviews. As we were criticizing and slapping around a dead ﬁsh. Welcome back to "The Game Room." Now, we've said this once. And if we say it once, it's like saying it a million times. We're not snobs. We're just better than you. And my point is that we are above and beyond the typical cliche’s of the game "Seaman" that everyone's making fun of. What we did is we wanted to make customers aware of the game. 50 Mark went out on the streets and went out to 90 interview people about the game "Seaman" to see if anybody was aware of the game. -Let's check out the footage. -Excuse me, Miss. Would you like to play with my Seaman? My Seaman has feelings. It's really special, and it wants you to play with it. That looks like it hurt. What girl doesn't like "Seaman"? Yeah. Seriously. Every girl I've ever talked to that I've ever known has liked this game. And let's take a look at the game before we dig ourselves into a bigger hole. My name is Leonard Nimoy, and I will be your guide. Well, this is your ﬁrst day with the "Seaman" kit. Your ﬁrst step will involve preparing the tank for Seaman's arrival. Wow. I don't remember Spock ever sounding that sexy. It starts off with this laboratory. Leonard's like, "Hey, you're here. Here's your kit. Professor Jacques... did something with something." Anyway, they give you an egg. You drop it in. What you just saw there. And then the egg or whatever that thing is. It's like a ball full of fungus or things that look at you funny. They're like eyeballs with strings. Then there's this thing. You start tapping on that thing, and it goes and eats the mushrooms. -lt eats like six of them. -They look like balloons. So at this point, this is like 20 minutes into the game. We're just sitting there like, "What the... It takes a while to get into this game because it's a life simulator. I guess you'd call it that. You have this aquarium. You drop an egg in it. It takes forever for stuff to happen. Now what you should probably do is check on it like two times a day. But since the Dreamcast has a clock inside of it, time elapses in real time, I guess you would say. So you can cheat by setting the clock time ahead, of course. This all takes place in the ﬁrst day. Now it's shooting and crapping out Seaman. Yeah. It's spitting out Seaman. There's one right there. They all have the same face. I don't know whose face that is. Now, depending how many of these Seamen you get, depending how many mushrooms or whatever that thing is eats. Then they all come out and start talking baby talk at ﬁrst. And you start talking to it with your Dreamcast microphone. You got the voice-recognition software going. I guess it's trying to recognize your voice. Unfortunately, you can't ﬂing these things around the room. Here's us setting the clock ahead. We're gonna ShDW you some actual interaction with Seaman. But by setting the clock ahead, you can actually increase the development speed of Seaman, therefore making the game a lot less boring. Here's Seaman growing up. After so long, he turns into what they call Gillman. And his vocabulary starts to increase. He starts asking you questions. You can name him. I named my Seaman Serpentor. Yet again, you can't crush them. Let's show an actual bit of game interaction here. Hello, Seaman. Good morning. Good morning, Seaman. What do you want? Seaman, you're going to...die. He's not responding. -Die. -That's very nice of you. We're going to turn you into a ﬁsh sandwich. Fish sandwich. -Seaman sucks. -He does suck. Bitch. You're welcome. We're going to eat you. Seaman, how would you like it if I grabbed you by... Let's be sure and get my name right, skin puppet. I will rip you in half and like it. How do you like that? Not right now. Yeah, right now. Do you like Leonard Nimoy? What's up? Leonard Nimoy. Spock. So listen. Do you have any kids? I ate them. Whatever. ls Dave a bitch? You're welcome. Put this tongue in that mouth? Dream on. Okay. One more time. You suck. So does your mother. How is your father's health? Good. He passed away? Sure. Hey, Seaman! What the hell is going on out there? ...you! He's very docile. You won't be so passive when I rip that...antenna off your head. Look at me. What the hell is going on out there.7 Look at me when I'm talking to you. Can you boil him? No. It's too hot now. Slap him again. Stop it. ...you, Seaman. I said watch it. I'm gonna kill him. I'm dying here. This is too hot. How do you take air out? Can you put too much air in? Die. I'm dying here. This is too hot. Die already. First thing we're gonna do is play reset the clock. What do you think? One day? Two days? Three. In fact, we may just torture him slowly. May? I don't think we had any other intentions but to torture him slowly. Good morning. What else is there to do, really? No. It's too hot now. Just die! Last chance. Do you like "The Game Room"? I'm suffocating. Turn up the air. Do you like "The Game Room"? Do you want to die? I'm telling you. I can't breathe. Are you listening? Must have more air. I thought you were a ﬁsh. Breathe underwater, you bitch. You want me to open some Seaman whoop-ass? Do ya? Hey. Quit hitting me. We call him "red-headed Stepchild." I can't breathe. What are you trying to do to me? - Kill you. - Kill you. This voice-recognition software sucks. My next breath will be my last if you don't turn up the air. We are slowly and methodically, systematically killing Seaman. In a torturous, horrible way. Maybe we'll freeze him next time. Think if we go from hot to cold real fast, he'll break? He'll probably puke. Happened to me in college. Seaman has now gone three or four days without food. -We lost count. -Or oxygen. What do you want? My next breath will be my last if you don't... Next time just throw a dry-cleaning bag over my head. He's dead! Float. -Bye. -Float, Seaman. See you in ﬁsh hell. He's going to the top. Can you slap him? Slap. Slap the dead ﬁsh. That sucks. Can we get a laundry bag next time? Do they have laundry bags in this game? Wow. Okay. I suppose we should probably talk about the game itself a little bit. Because I'll be honest with you. After you play with Seaman for a while, he tends to get a little boring. Yeah. Seaman only has so much interest for me. Yeah. Most people would be committed if they were found talking to Seaman. Yeah. In fact, the worst moment of my life came when I was talking to Seaman and my girlfriend walked in on me. That was good. Was that good? In this time of darkness, we had a glimmer of hope. Summer of 2000, when Nintendo put a video ad on the beginning of the "Game Room" episodes. And this was a very new thing at the time. This was brand-new for companies to past video ads on other people's Web sites. It's very commonplace now. It was like a roller-coaster ride. Or not. The ad was for "Perfect Dark" for the N64. This was a huge game for them. And "The Game Room," Dave and I, reviewed "Perfect Dark." So we had the chance for success, for corporate sponsorship, possibly getting some advertising money. And what did we do with this except we just made fun of "Perfect Dark" from front to back. We insulted them. We insulted Nintendo. Chicks with big guns. I approve. We basically just... all over that game. So that brings me to a point about "The Game Room," which is we never got a dime, certainly not after that. We never got a dime from advertising. We never got a dime -- We might have gotten a dime. We never got much more than a dime from advertising. We never had corporate sponsorship. We never got free video games or review copies. We did this all ourselves. And to be honest with you, we gave the most objective, thorough reviews, I think, that I had seen anywhere at that time. We just told it like it was. And I really think that was actually part of why people liked "The Game Room." We had no chance of getting any corporate sponsorship anyway. So why bother? So we gave pretty honest reviews. Is he okay? Well, Dave, I guess she got the point. I guess she did. This being, by the way, the ﬁrst Nintendo 64 game "The Game Room" has ever even bothered to review. Yes. We weren't around when "Golden Eye" was ﬁrst released. But maybe one day we'll do it when it's a classic game. It already is, but we'll wait. This is, obviously. made by the same people who made "GoldenEye." -It is the same game. -lt's just different chicks. -Different weapons. -Bond is a chick now. Different weapons. That'd be weird, man, if Bond was a chick. I wouldn't want to go see the movies anymore. Well, except for those lesbian scenes. The Nintendo Entertainment System presents "Metroid." They've really managed to squeeze all the power they can, after all these years, out of the NES. 8-bit has never looked so good. You know, Dave, last time I was in Singapore, I caught Metroids again. I heard you were in quarantine for three or four weeks. It's that itchy. scratchy feeling. lt just doesn't go away. You need some of that Goldenseal Power. Here we have the impressive Nintendo -- Honestly, this looks like about 8-bit graphics right here. They're cut scenes. Thi is sort of out of maybe Sega CD. -Sega Genesis. -Something like that. Yeah. After playing "Front Mission 3" and seeing the beautiful, cinematic animation scenes, this looks like crap. Here's our lady. Mary Jane. -Dave, you named her. -Hello, Mary Jane. And here's Mary Jane talking out her differences with her opponents. It's good to see a game that reinforces positive beliefs, like talking and communication with your enemy. That's correct. There's nothing quite like resolving a problem without resulting in blatant violence. No. See, right there, there was a discussion taking place. We turned the audio off. You can't exactly hear it. Now, these guys were saying, "We talked for a little while, but then, you know, it didn't work out. It didn't work out the way we planned." Things went sour. But anyway, we were fairly unimpressed with the graphics, as we told you. -The game play kicks ass. -The game play is good. It's basically just "Golden Eye" part 2 with a chick and lasers. -Yeah. -Pretty much. But there are a couple subtle differences with this game. When you get hit, your vision goes blurry. Which is kind of cool. There's more enemies on the screen at one time in this game than there were in "Band." The environments are bigger and more detailed. Fortunately, all the bad guys have really bad aim. They all have bad aim, and they have horrible reaction times. They're just sort of like, "Oh." We were playing on the easy level so we could get through the game. I did play one of the harder levels, and it's harder. Gee. What a surprise. Anyway, it is absolutely comical how bad. It's kind of like if you're G.l. Joe and running through the Cobra stronghold. You know, the Cobra forces being absolutely devoid of any intelligence whatsoever. Of course. They're the bad guys, Mark. Every now and then, if you're not sure you've killed somebody, you can double-tap them to the head a couple times. I really don't like this unrealistic violence, though. By now their head should have exploded. Full of bullets. Just riddled with bullets. Their body should be in a million pieces. Unfortunately, it doesn't do that. And for a little while, Mark. we were really excited because the dead bodies didn't go away. But if you leave the hallway and come back... There's always one remaining, just so you know you've been there before. At least they don't blink in front of you and go away. That's like antagonizing me. That's saying. "We don't support this mass destruction and violence." They don't blink and go away. They go away kind of while your back is turned. -lt's kind of like Santa Claus. -You got to give it to Rare. They did make a really good game with the hardware they have. It's just too bad such talented programmers have to work with such an underpowered system. It's awful. Another criticism. You can't shoot civilians without being penalized. That's...weak. That's bull... This game kind of has a sense of humor. I don't think it actually plays well with the story line. I would think it would have been better if it was more serious. When you encounter the alien, it turns into this Teletubbies sidekick. You know what it's like? It's like a wisecracking alien. -Here's a good ﬁght scene. -Blatantly shooting people. You don't want to use grenades in close range. You tend to hurt yourself. That's a self-destructive attitude. It's like "Teen Wolf." You see red. We are very upset with the pricing of this. Now, you're very naive. You're virgins to the N64, so to speak, like us. You've also been sucked into the hype. You're just thinking, "It's the best game ever. I have to own this game." So you got a $60 game. Yes. Then you read the back of the box closely. "Requires the N64 Expansion Pak." What the...is that? Where did this thing come from? This thing is like 30 bucks. We'll add on tax and shipping. And the game is good. But it is not the end-all, be-all of video games like it's been made out to be. It is exactly the same game play as "GoldenEye." Which is good. Great game play. I like that you do something and you turn around, there's sirens going off. There's stealth missions. Seek-and-destroy missions. Got like a hundred guards rushing at you. You know, you just open ﬁre on them. We really like the fact, as we demonstrated in the beginning, that you can ﬁre arrows at people and have them stick out of their head. Wherever. We're big fans of that. I like when they scream when they die. I don't want to die! "Oh, my God!" Why me? "Why me?" There's a saying that "all good things must come to an end." And on October 23, 2000, "The Game Room" was canceled. was shut down. "Game Room" viewers continued to watch the shows on e, anxiously awaiting any new reviews, which never came. We were canceled so abruptly in October of 2000 that we had "Game Room" episodes half complete that we just had to leave. And a number of episodes were ﬁlmed. We had given reviews of the games, gotten the footage, had the pieces ready to assemble and post online. and were never able to. So after my expectations of this game actually sucking major ass, it doesn't. Which bring me to "Yars' Revenge" for the Atari 2600, an episode that we ﬁlmed in the summer of 2000 and has taken until the winter of 2007 to complete. This is an episode that's seven years in the making. "Yars' Revenge." In the Razak solar system lives an advanced race of beings known as the Yars. Originally descended from ordinary Earth houseﬂies, the Yars are peaceful and intelligent. They can ﬂy around in space and love to eat sewer pipes, which they then convert into powerful blasts of energy. In a neighboring galaxy live the Qotile. Angry, bitter, and misunderstood, the Qotile detest all insects except for cute, cuddly butterﬂies. Only a fragile peace in the Neutral Zone keep the two races from war. Yar weapons contractors lobbied Congress for $90 quadrillion to build the powerful Zorlon Cannon for defense. The Qotile saw this as a form of intergalactic saber rattling and attacked. The weapons contractors and Yar politicians took their money and ran, going on vacation before completing the Zorlon Cannon. In order to destroy the Qotile, you must ﬂy to their heavily shielded base and manually transmit ﬁring coordinates back to the cannon. And so another brave Yar ﬂies off to ﬁght the Qotile. Welcome back to another "Game Room" extravaganza classic game. Today's game is "Yars' Revenge" for the Atari 2600. An obvious classic. Now, if everybody is here thinking, "Yar. That must be some caveman getting revenge for someone dragging his woman away," you're dead wrong. In fact, this game takes place in the future. When insects can think and talk and ﬁre laser beams and stuff. Yeah. Sort of like "Starship Troopers," but not really. And I believe it's called the Cursor of Doom. It looks like a blinking cursor. It just kind of blinks at you. And you've got a little force ﬁeld. You got a little force ﬁeld that your ship is supposedly safe in. But we'll ﬁnd out about that right now, when we check out the footage. So you can break down his force ﬁeld. -His.7 Theirs. -lts. Whatever. I didn't mean to be sexually discriminative there with the bug. Now, that defensive force-ﬁeld thing. It's kind of like just distortion on the Atari that you can hide in. Basically. They ﬁgure, "Hey, if we do a lack of programming there, that can be a force ﬁeld." That was some pretty intelligent stuff going on. They were wise. Now, you can hide from the cursor, but you can't hide from the ion cannon blasts coming from beneath the energy ﬁeld. No. That you cannot. But there's nothing you can do from an ion blast. This game's old. I kind of wish it had an ending. You just keep playing. It keeps getting faster. And at the end of the game, you're here, and it starts to... And, you know. Just keeps going and getting faster and getting different colors. Pretty lame. Good game, though. Hours of entertainment as a child. And they did make a remake for the Color Game Boy. That we haven't played yet. Lots of strategy in this game. 'Cause you got to ﬁre your laser blast just at the right time to launch your gigantic missile thing... Lots of strategy. Into the ion cannon thing with two eyes and a nose, which is kind of what it looked like. Lots of strategy. Party! -Party! -Party! ...you, you Qotile bitches! Party! Give me a beer. In a strange twist of fate, We primarily produce and distribute documentary ﬁlms. And I now produce and direct a number of historical documentary ﬁlms. And I think this all started with "The Game Room." October of 2000, closed its doors forever. We took our best material. We sidestepped over to DVD. The DVD market was exploding in late 2000 and early 2001. And we started producing essentially documentary ﬁlms on DVD. Our ﬁrst release was "Civil War Minutes" in 2001, which originally aired as "Civil War Minutes" Over the past seven years of doing documentary ﬁlm work, I've become very interested in history. Become very interested in American history and what soldiers went through in the Civil War, World War I. It's been fascinating to actually learn about history and ﬁnd out that it can be fun, that it can be really entertaining. And I think what I've tried to do in all my documentary ﬁlms is to take these historical subjects and make them fun and exciting. We still get e-mails of people asking if "The Game Room" is going to come back. And the fact is, we tried this a year or two ago. We tried to bring back "The Game Room." Dave and I are both doing very different things now. So we couldn't get together as the old team. We'd like to in the future, but we couldn't. So a year or two ago, we tried it with a new host. And it just, you know... Things didn't work out. Welcome to "Game Room; The Next Generation." Please put your hands together for the new host, Sir Droolzzalot. Scene 1 Apple, take 2. I still view the early 1980s as the most exciting time to be a gamer. Because as a kid I remember how excited we were to go from an Atari 2600 all the way up to a Nintendo Entertainment System. "Super Mario Brothers." And laying on the ﬂoor, playing Atari. You had to have it right next to theTV and run the wires from the back of the Atari. The game controller only had one little button. The classics, like "Pac-Man" and "Missile Command" and "Space Invaders" and "Joust." And these are all games I still love. I still play them when I get a chance. I go to the arcade, I always set the high score on "Ms. Pac-Man." I don't remember what my best score on "Ms. Pac-Man" is. But I do remember playing it for a very, very long time. If I'm passing a "Ms. Pac-Man" machine, I still play. I love that game. That's a tremendous game. Which brings me to one of my all-time favorite "Game Room" episodes, where we reviewed "Alien" for the Atari 2600 and parodied ourself throughout the entire episode as "The Real Game Room." Enjoy. This is a true story of two video-game dorks chosen to do a video-game review show together and to have their lives taped and exploited to all of you. So what kind of behind-the-scenes secrets for "Game Room"? Well, to be honest with you, we don't actually play any of the games. Even We don't have any of the systems. We've never played Atari. I don't even know what a Dreamcast is. Somebody just told me about it one day. It's, like, a Sega thing. I guess it's Sega, whatever. Everyone's always asking me, "What do you think of PlayStation 2 and Xbox?" I'm like, "What the... are you talking about?" I think I ﬁgured out how to plug in one of the wires. Is it making any noises yet? No. I thought it was supposed to make noises. Oh. Look at that. -Why is there a CD in there? -Looks like it takes CDs. That's probably not supposed to be there. You don't need CD5 to play games, do you? No. It should just hook up to the Internet, shouldn't it? Right. Right? I don't know. All right. What's this? I guess the cartridge is in here. I think that's... Well, I know my Backstreet Boys CD came in a case like that. So maybe that means there's music with the game. But I don't understand where the game is. You want to return it? I can't read the instructions. I can't read. Do you want to return this and see if we can get a real copy? 'Cause obviously this one is faulty. Well, we can use it for a drink coaster or something. Why? Why am I here, standing on this toilet in this bathroom? Because this is the only place I can get a little bit of privacy when I'm not shooting "Game Room." lt's...ridiculous. It's like I have no privacy at all. He's just constantly harassing me and yelling at me. You know him. You've seen the show. He never stops talking. l just sit there. l'm just like, "God damn it!" And so this is the only place I get a minute of free time and I get to relax. While I'm standing on a goddamn toilet. That's pretty much it. Here. Try to put the... Wait. Yeah. It's making noises. Well, we're supposed to review a game this week. Let's put "RoboCop" in. All right. Let's try it. It probably would ﬁt where the mouth is. Yeah. It should just automatically start up, shouldn't it? Is this supposed to close all the way? No. I think you're supposed to jam it down into it. Is that a good idea? They're all very gullible. Because they don't realize we actually don't play the games. We read a lot of magazines and cartoons and stuff. And I take a lot of -- I'm the brain behind the entire show. I take all that, and I basically tum i into the show. We sit there. l...out everything. Dave kind of plays along with me. And that's how the show goes. It really isn't anything more than that. Dave's basically a pawn in my master game. Just set it in. Just set it straight up. I think that's howl saw it on TV. Yeah. All right. Where's the picture come out on? Do we have a TV? Somewhere. -Want a beer? -Yeah. What it comes down to is Dave's expendable. I don't get -- What's it do? It doesn't make beer. Are we getting paid to stand here? No. Let's move. -Let's go over there. -Maybe this makes beer. Does this make beer? Beer? It doesn't make beer. What's the point? I don't know. It's useless. Now, the show "The Game Room" is more important than Dave ever will be. I mean, really, Dave means nothing. All the e-mail comes to me. They say, "Mark, you're God. We dress like you. We walk like you." You know, "We want to be like you." It's this kind of thing I have. Really, I feel like I'm God. Run! Is that a Power Pellet? The strip club is that way. Don't you want to go to the strip club.7 Well, yeah. Strip club's that way. The strip club is that way. We got to get there quick and get back to shoot an episode. No. I don't want to take one of your goddamn shortcuts. Okay. Chill out. You always want to take your damn shortcuts. You never respect my feelings, Dave. -I don't like you. That's why. -l'm a very emotional person. How many times do I have to tell you I don't like you? I don't even know why I'm here. You were busy throwing bottles at me the one day, and you paid me to be on the Show. I don't like hanging out with you. Remember last year we went out to that movie? You wore that gray sweater. And you know I don't like that gray sweater. You do not look good in gray. And you were that gray sweater. You embarrassed me in front of my friends. I look very good in gray. How the...do you think that makes me feel? I don't care about your friends! I've had it! I'll get out and walk away right now! We're not going to the strip club. What do you mean? Dave, we're gonna go to the library. I'm sorry. It is punishment time for you. When did you learn to read? When did you get all big and bad? I'm not the one reading. You're the one reading. -You need to...read. -You read. How did I pick the left side of the table? Is there somebody there? False call. Anyway, the left side of the table. That was a dispute that came up quite a few times before we actually started shooting the Show. I never actually picked the left side of the table. I actually wanted the right side of the table. 'Cause I just have a preference for the right side of things. It's my good side. I just really wanted the good side. I mean, that's all I wanted in the ShDW. But unfortunately, we can't always get what we want. So... I'm sorry. What the...is wrong with you, man? This is my private time! You know that, Joe! Just get out of here! Why do you have to bother me? God. You're like a...idiot. What's wrong with you? This is my private time. Private time! What the... is wrong with you? You're gonna try and tell me "Pac-Man" is better than "Donkey Kong"? "Pac-Man" is so much better than "Donkey Kong." Have you totally lost it? It's totally better than "Donkey Kong." Why don't you...bitch.7 You're gonna push me? -You want some? -That's it. I'm gonna kick your ass. It's 90 time! I can't do the show. What are you talking about, you can't do the show? -Where's the coke? -What do you mean? -l'm not talking to you. -What do you mean? Where have you been for the last half hour? I can't do the ShDW without it. -lt's that simple. -Where have you been? -l was setting up the studio. -l'm not talking to you. You were supposed to be getting ready. You were supposed to be doing your coke. Where is the hair and makeup lady? Your hair and makeup lady? What are you talking about? "60 Minutes" is looking at me. They're looking at me as an anchorman. -CNN asked about me last week. -Nobody is looking at you. Okay. "The Game Room" is not going anywhere because of you. Because of you, our...show is not going anywhere. -I will go to CNN. -Because of me? It's because of you and your cake habit. Where the... is my hair lady person? What are you doing? No. No. You stay back there, all right? -No. I want the midget. -You're doing the show. I don't care what you say. Put the wings back on him. You are doing the show. ...you, Dave. I don't want to hear your...anymore. -Hey. Welcome to "The Game Room." I'm here with my buddy Dave. Today we're doing a good game, so to speak. Yeah. We're doing "Alien." Well, it's a bad game off of a good movie, actually. is what it really is. And I believe they have a new slogan for the game that we coined. We coined the new phrase. "The Game Room" coined a special phrase. Called "In space, no one can hear you complain about a bad video game." That's apparently what the developers back in the '805 were thinking when they programmed this game. Because it blows. I think they were thinking a lot like, "Hey. Let's make a game that looks a lot like another game with a yellow guy that has a pie shape taken out of him that chumps." Now, I don't know what game that might be. So let's take a look at some game footage? -Yeah. -All right. This is an Atari game that really captures the actual excitement, look, and feel of the movie "Alien." I think you see the Ridley Scott and H.R. Giger inﬂuence very detailed here. I see it with the extreme close-ups, with the shimmering light and Venetian blinds. It's very, very nice. Now, I'm really disappointed Yaphet Kotto didn't make a surprise appearance in here. -No. -lt's unfortunate. If you notice on the left side of the screen, some of the "Pac-Man"-esque dots aren't appearing. By the way, that looks a lot like Sigourney Weaver there. See, that's what I'm talking about with the close-ups. It catches it very nicely. You can see the shimmering light, and the sound effects are unbelievable. Get back over here. We have to ﬁnish the show. Right now. We have to ﬁnish the show. We only have like 10 minutes left. Jesus. This...l have to work with. I don't believe this. Anyway, welcome back. You've seen the game footage. You've heard our opinions. I wasn't too keen on this game simply because it was a complete rip-off. Right, Mark? -It was blue? -Right.7 Anyway, we didn't like this game too much. And... What? Are you gonna say anything? No. Okay. Anyway, this game is a complete rip-off of "Pac-Man." I want to go play outside. I do. Okay. Somebody get this man a doctor. "Frogger"! "Frogger"! Welcome to "The Game Room." You know what "Game Room" smells like? Smells like victory. Yeah. It's good stuff. I don't get to do this enough. I knows Shakespeares like a mother... Romeo, Romeo. Wherefore art thy, stud? "Game Room" eventually moved outside the studio, where we shot such amazing episodes as "X-Men" and "Duck Hunt" in this back lot. It warms my heart just standing here. I can't even keep my eyes open. We have to do more back-and-forth conversation so I can actually test the audio. Okay. I understand what you're saying. You're saying I should talk and you should... Talk as well. And if I'm done talking... -Then I'll start talking. -I may start complaining. Boy, we are clever. But my point here. I had a point, and it's banging around in there somewhere. Where was my point? Where was it? Bear with me. What the...was ljust gonna say? You just killed it, man. I was going. I was there. I had it. My feet are sweaty How are yours? I am wearing no socks I have sneakers on It's 100 degrees And feet are pretty nasty-feeling Testing. One, two, three. Testing. We hear you. One, two, three. Testing. And testing. One, two. And I'm testing, too. I'm gonna start at three. Four, ﬁve, six, seven, eight. -One. -Two. -Three. -Four. -Five. -Six. -Eight. -Damn it. Hey, welcome to "The Game Room." We're broadcasting from Vegas. And Dave couldn't be here right now. He's off doing something terribly important to help the future success of our show. I can't tell you what that... There you are. God. These are free here. And we got another game tonight. Don't we? I guess so. What are we doing? I don't remember. Wait. Oh, yeah. "Wild Metal" for the Dreamcast. Number 16. And it was a game for the Dreamcast. It still is. -And... -lt's good. We liked it a lot. Well, you drove a tank around. You drive a few tanks around. They move. Let's do it over again. I just chugged this. Someone's gonna throw a...tiger into our room one of these days. And if you're listening right now, you suck.
