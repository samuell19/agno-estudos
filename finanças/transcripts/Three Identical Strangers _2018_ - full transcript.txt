When I tell people my story they don't believe it. I guess I wouldn't believe the story if someone else were telling it, but, I'm telling it and it's true, every word of it. It started when I was born, 56 years ago, but the real story began when I was 19 years old and I went to college. It was 1980. It was the first day of school at Sullivan County Community College up in the Catskills, about 110 miles from where I grew up. So, I drove up there alone. ♪ I get the same old dreams ♪ Same time every night ♪ Fall to the ground and I wake up... I used to have this really old car. It was a Volvo. And it was a 1970 Volvo. Had like 130,000 miles on it. And the car was burgundy and the hood was green. Actually, the car was called the Old Bitch. ♪ Since you been gone ♪ Since you been gone ♪ I'm out of my head... ♪ But the Old Bitch got me there. Sullivan was a community college. This wasn't some longstanding institution of higher learning. All these station wagons are dropping kids off. I was nervous, I'd just gotten to the school, I didn't know anybody. I was a freshman. I was never the captain of the football team in high school, so I was never really like popular. So, I'm walking around trying to find where my dorm is. Meanwhile all these people are coming up to me saying "Hi, how are you?" "How was your summer?" "Mine was great. How was yours?" "Super." Why are they asking me how my summer was? I don't know. Everybody's being extremely friendly to me and they're going out of their way to do it. I don't mean just a 'hi', I mean, claps on the back and high fives. And I was a little bit bewildered by this because no one gets this kind of a welcome on their first day at school. And girls were kissing me, like fully kissing me saying, "I'm so glad you came back." And I was saying 'thank you' and 'hello' back but I had never been there before and I didn't know them. It was bizarre. And the next thing I heard from right behind me. "Welcome back. Eddy!" "Eddy! How are you? Eddy, hi!" I'm like, "My name's not Eddy. I don't know "what you're talking about. I just got up here." "Sure, Eddy, you're really funny, "you're really funny, real funny." I'm like, "I'm not Eddy. I don't know who Eddy is." "Welcome back, Eddy", they were all saying. I finally made it to this dump of a dorm room. Before a minute had gone by... "Who now? Who now is gonna come to find Eddy?" I had been at college the previous year with Eddy, and I knew that he wasn't coming back to school. As soon as this guy turned around, I... I was, I was actually shaking. I was... I know all colour from my face dropped 'cause I knew it was his double. He had the same grin, the same hair, the same expressions. It was his double. And I see this guy's face and he's like... just standing there. The first thing out of my mouth was "Were you adopted?" and I was like, "Yes." I said, "Is your birthday July 12th?" He said yes. I was like, "July 12th 1961." "Oh my God", I said, "You're not going to believe this." I said, "You have a twin brother. You have a twin." "Oh my God." I said, "Come with me." And the two of us are crammed into this phone booth, shoulder to shoulder and you know, we had to like, close the door of the phone booth. And I'm trying to put the coins in and they keep falling on the floor and Bobby's picking up the coins. And he calls this guy and he's like, "Hey, Eddy, you're not going to believe this, "you're not going to believe this. "Eddy, Eddy, you are not going to believe this." This guy's more hysterical than I am like weirded out. "Eddy, you are not going to believe this." So I was like, "Give me the phone." So I'm like, "Hi, Eddy?" "Yes." But it was my voice that said, "Yes." And I said, "Hi, Eddy, my name is Robert Shafran "and, um... I'm meeting all these people "who say I'm you." And he said, "Uh-huh, yeah, I've been getting some calls." I said, "Were you adopted?" and he said, "Yes." And I said, "When was your birthday?" "July 12th." And I said, "Do you know what the name of the agency was?" And he said, "No, hold on." And I heard him go like, "Mum?" And he came back and he said, "Louise Wise Services." Sometimes when you are just having a dream, you know this can't be real, this can't be real. But you know there's nothing you can do to stop it, start it, change it, you just go with it and that's what I was doing. I just wanted to see what was gonna happen next. And I'm like, "Let's go. Let's go meet Eddy." So we got into the Old Bitch. It was about 9 o'clock at night and it's about a two-hour ride. And we were speeding on route 17. We were going 100 miles per hour, perhaps more. We were speeding. We're driving as fast as this car would go. It was shaking. And we got pulled over by a New York State trooper. And as I roll down my window there's this gigantic cop with like the sunglasses even though it's night time. In the big hat. He said, "You know, I clocked you at 88 in a 50. "Son, you better have a really good reason." And I was like, "Well, Officer, you're never going to believe this." The two of us are like yelling at this guy. "You, you don't know, "this guy, this guy has a twin brother, "he was adopted and we're going to Long Island to go see..." And, and, and the guy was, "Yeah, right." You know. "Here's, here's your ticket have a good day." And on to Long Island we went. So, we got there. But it's like, the middle of the night. And it's this really quiet neighbourhood. So, we get out of the car. And walk up this little path to the house. And the lights were on in the house. And I reached out to knock on the door and as I reached out to knock on the door it opens. And there I am. His eyes were my eyes and my eyes were his eyes and it's true. They looked exactly alike. They're duplicates of each other. There was no doubt in my mind that they were twins. He's going, "Oh my God." I'm going, "Oh my God." He's going, "Holy crap." I'm going, "Holy crap." They just looked at each other and they moved... Every time Bobby moved his head, Eddy moved and then Eddy would move and then Bobby would move, like, like they were looking at a mirror. It was the weirdest thing. It was like the world faded away, and it was just me and Eddy. So, I'm in the newsroom, it's the middle of a busy day, we got a call from somebody who says they have an amazing story to tell us, we are not going to believe this story, and my first reaction, "Ah, it's a hoax." So, I told our reporter, "I want to rent a plane." In those days we had enough money to do this. "I want to rent a plane, I want to see these two kids face to face "or I don't believe this." We flew the journalist up to Sullivan Community College and he called me and he said, "Howie, it's true, it's true. And I remember saying, "Oh my God, this is a great story. "This is a memorable heart-warming story." And then the story went from being amazing to incredible, OK, from amazing to incredible. I was on the New York Subway. Quite late at night. Read an article about two boys who found each other. That were twins separated at birth and found each other at Sullivan County Community College. There was no picture, but the story was fascinating. I came home, and went to sleep. My mother came into the room and said, "Wake up, wake up, I have to show you something." And she shows me a newspaper with a picture of two boys and I had to like, focus and I looked at the photograph and I said, "Is that David?" And she's like, "No, but look at the hands." And I was like, "Holy mackerel. This is beyond amazing." It was a picture in the newspaper of two guys, in the "Post" and I picked up the picture and I looked at it, and I was like in shock, cos the two guys in the "Post" looked exactly, exactly like, like my friend David. I stared at it. And it wasn't even just the look on their face. It was the way that they were holding their hands. They have these big meaty hands. And David always had this, these hands that looked like baseball mitts. And when I saw their hands, I just knew that this is David. It was just a normal day. I got to school, ran into my buddy Alan. He said, "David, take a look at this." And he's got a copy of the "New York Post". And, um... he opens it up and says, "Look at this. "Look, look familiar?" Something to that effect. And I said, "Yeah, right. Sure." But then we looked at it a little bit more closely. It was an article, it said, "Twins reunited after more than 19 years." And it had a picture of two of what looked like me. It all started to sink in. "Holy shit, oh my God. "Do you? This is un... this is not believable, "this is, this is unbelievable. Wow! "This is big, this is serious, "this is just not some kind of crazy coincidence. "This is not a minor resemblance. "This is real, this is happening, "this is really, really serious." I ditched classes and got home. My mother was waiting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee. And I said, "Mum, you see this?" She said, "You see this?" And we kinda exchanged newspapers. It had "...born Long Island Jewish Hospital." "July 12th, 1961." And it was Louise Wise adoption agency. I mean, I always knew growing up that I was adopted. My parents were always open about it. But it said Eddy Galland of New Hyde Park, Long Island, Robert Shafran of Scarsdale, New York. I remember it said, "Son of prominent Scarsdale physician Mort Shafran" and, uh... my first thought, I said, "He's got the wealthy family. "That SOB's probably driving a Benz! He got a doctor!" And I remember being with David in the kitchen. We were like, really nervous. I mean we were, you know, jumping around, it was... You know, we were 19 years old. I mean this was surreal. And David picked up the phone and he called Information, and he reached Eddy's mum. And I said, "Hi, is Eddy home?" She says, "No, who's calling, please?" And I thought, "OK, "now I've gotta go into this whole thing on the phone." I said, "Well, my name is David Kellman, "and I was born July 12th 1961 "and I'm looking at a newspaper "and, uh... basically I think I'm looking at two of me. "I think I might be the third." And I think she dropped the phone, actually. And I remember hearing her voice over the phone, "Oh my God, they're coming out of the woodwork!" It was a miracle. The first time that the boys met together, the three together was at my house. And the three of them ended up like puppies wrestling on the floor. It was the most incredible... it was the most incredible thing. They belonged to each other. They knew each other. There was no formal introduction. I mean, when you meet somebody for the first time you don't end up rolling around on the floor with them. It was truly not fully believable. Even though it was happening it was still surreal. You think you're dreaming. You're looking and you're still "Oh my God." You look at the other one, "Oh my God." And then you realise that they're looking at you or everybody else is looking at you too. To have all three of them in the house at one time... it was really madness. My emotions were shock, shock and more shock. I mean, I can't explain it, I haven't got the terminology. One of our reporters came running over to me and said "You're not going to believe this, "you are not going to believe the call we just got. "You know the two kids on the front page today? "Well, there's a third." They even moved the same way. All of us just sat back and watched three separate lives becoming one. The way I put it was I looked more like Eddy than I did David, and more like David than I did Eddy, and more like either of them than they did like each other. Does that make sense? And then we started comparing notes. What do 19-year-olds compare? Booze, cigarettes, food, women, music, cars. I had just brought a brand new Mercury Capri, which I loved. And Bobby had this, Maroon beat up old Volvo with cracked leather seats and I'm thinking, "Hmm, son of a prominent Scarsdale physician, huh?" I think it was Eddy who said right at the beginning, "I don't know if this will turn out to be great or terrible." So, there was always a question mark, a big question mark, about where the story eventually was going. We didn't realise from then on just how much things were going to change. 'Now one of the most remarkable stories I've seen in some time: 'a story about triplets. 'Eddy and Robert and David reunited after 19 years.' 'We have a story about triplets that gives new meaning 'to the phrase long lost brothers.' We went on everything. Everything. 'You're not seeing double 'you are perhaps in a moment going to be seeing triple.' 'I don't know who's who here. 'Come on out here, gentlemen, come on out.' You just had to stop what you're doing and watch them on every different show. It became a circus, it became a media circus. Talk about viral, I mean this was... it was viral even then. 'You guys have been on the front page of every newspaper - 'in the world.' - 'True.' "People Magazine", "Time Magazine", even the "New York Times", "Good Housekeeping". 'David, let's begin with you. 'Which one's David, I keep forgetting?' - 'You're Edward?' - 'Right.' 'OK, who are you, are you David?' - 'I'm Bobby.' - 'Oh, you're... I'm sorry. 'You're Robert, all right. Robert and Edward.' - 'Come on.' It was a fairy tale story. And people need to hear wonderful things. 'These three young men, 'they're all seated in the same position.' It was kind of amazing. They really were strangers. They looked identical to each other but they were strangers, right? You know, they really didn't know one another. But their behaviours were so similar. 'Our lives are parallel to a phenomenal degree. 'It's, it's ridiculous.' 'We're all the same, 'as soon as we started discussing our personalities.' 'Personalities are the same, our gestures are the same.' 'We always talk at the same time.' 'I'll start a sentence and he'll finish it.' 'We all like Chinese food.' 'You were all wrestlers at one time?' 'Yes.' 'You all smoke the same brand of cigarettes?' 'Yes.' 'What kind of cigarettes do you smoke?' 'Marlboro.' 'Do you all smoke the same brand?' 'Yes.' - 'Do you like the same colours?' - 'Yes.' 'Yeah, I was curious, how's their taste in women, - 'is it similar?' - 'Yes. Definitely.' It seems they all liked older women. 'Somebody said you all liked older women.' 'Well...' 'Another astonishing coincidence 'is that each of the brothers grew up with an adoptive sister, 'all the girls now 21 years old.' 'I can't get over it, I tell you.' 'An extraordinary string of coincidences 'you all have to agree, right?' 'It's beautiful.' 'You say you love each other, 'but you're only known each other for such a short time.' 'Doesn't matter, I've known them my whole life.' 'How long did it take for you to have that feeling?' - 'Like that.' They were more like clones than they were like brothers. It was just absolutely astounding because they grew up it would appear to be pretty different households. We'd been adopted by a blue-collar family, a middle-class family and a more affluent family. Bobby's parents, Bobby's father was a medical doctor. And his mother was an attorney. So they were very well educated and they were living in one of the most prestigious areas of the country. Eddy's father was a teacher, he had a college education. And they lived in what would be considered a middle-class neighbourhood. My family on paper were the least educated, they were immigrants, English was a second language to them, they had a little store, they were the more blue-collar family. Um, but my father was just this incredibly generous warm guy. David's father, Richard was, uh... was larger than life. If you could imagine this guy was a big guy, with a big cigar always hanging out of his mouth. We referred to him as 'bubala'. He was Bubala. If you know Yiddish, 'bubala' it's like love, it's hugging and it's kissing. We spent more time at David's house than any place else. Bubala celebrated us like no other person. He said, "I have two more sons." When the boys found each other it just sort of happened then and there. Here is this wonderful story and that's it. Nobody questioned what was going on except the parents of course. When the families met up the first time there was great anger in all of them about the fact that the parents had never been told that there were two other children. They didn't tell us a word when we were adopting. We knew nothing about the other two until, uh... the boys met at, at school, that was 20 years later. The first thing that hit me was what they lost. I believe they were six months old when they were separated. If you imagine those three little bodies lying together and suddenly the coldness of being alone in a crib. It's a terrible deprivation. I remember being told by my mother when I was a baby that I would slam my head against the wall, I would basically knock myself out. My mother said that I would bang my head on the inside of the crib... and I would hold my breath until I passed out. I believe it was absolutely separation anxiety All of us had been adopted from Louise Wise Services. 'Louise Wise Services, 'the New York institution founded back in 1916 'overseen by a board of directors 'drawn from New York City's 'social, financial and political elite.' They were the pre-eminent adoption agency on the East Coast for Jewish babies in particular. That was the place to go. What we have felt at Louise Wise Services where I have been active for a great long time, is that adoptive parents should be told as much about the background of a child as is reasonable. Our parents they, they, they wanted answers, they were angry. And they arranged a meeting and they... the six of them went in to Louise Wise Agency to try to get some answers in terms of piecing together what happened. There was a meeting with the top brass at the agency. And they were asked, "Is it true that you separated these boys at birth?" And they said, "Yes, we did." Why? How could you not tell us? What did you do? Why and how could you? They said the reason was because it was hard to place three children in one home. The parents had been told that it was in our best interests that we'd been split up. That not every parent would welcome triplets, and that triplets would be difficult to place. Which... I think at that moment my father blew his stack. And just said, "We would've taken all three. "There's no question." And he was furious. Well, the meeting came to an end. They all left. They felt like they had gotten nothing. And my father realised that he had left his umbrella in there. And he went back to get the umbrella. And he walked into the room to see them breaking open a bottle of champagne... and toasting each other as if they had dodged a bullet. They looked like they'd just missed getting hurt or killed or what have you. It was a uh... that was memorable. All of our parents came away from that meeting angry. The parents went to some pretty prestigious New York law firms and initially they were met with a lot of enthusiasm, and, um... invariably within a short period of time were told, um... there's a conflict and they could not take the case. They said, "We have a number of associates "who are trying to adopt through Louise Wise, "and we don't want to ruin their chances." So, that lawsuit was out. We were too happy being together to be that angry. We didn't understand it and to a degree we almost didn't care. Our heads were in the clouds, we knew our parents were pissed off but it was almost like, "Well, that's our parents' thing to do" while we were out partying. ♪ Friday night and everyone's moving... This was New York in 1980. Drugs were different, people were different, sex was different, music was different. Phew! We just, we just took advantage of all those things. Sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll. ♪ We're the kids in America, whoa... ♪ They were running amok in New York, I'll say. Studio 54 was cooking. Limelight. Copacabana. They were hitting them all. New York loved us. New York loved us. All the newspapers were following the boys around no matter where we went. I remember one morning walking in and my mother throwing the "New York Post" at me, at the kitchen table saying, "I gotta look at the paper "to find out where you were last night?" The boys thought they were going to be stars, and actually they did star in one movie. Walking down the street, all of a sudden we hear, "Guys, guys, you're the guys! "Could you please be in our movie? "Please be in my movie." We didn't know who she was, and she was, she was Madonna. The stood on the side and ogled her. Pretty soon we got an apartment together, the triplets apartment. The triplet's apartment. Hmm, it's like if you had the most bachelor apartment times three. The liquor store used to deliver the liquor. At one point Eddy had appendicitis. He had no insurance. And so he checked into the hospital as Bobby. And had his appendix taken out. As Bobby. I hope to this day Bobby's appendix stays pretty healthy. Between working together, playing together, going out together, going on dates together, living together, from the time we met till... well till later there was nothing, nothing that could keep us apart. I feel like I was the first serious girlfriend. Initially I couldn't really tell them apart and I would bump into them and I wasn't quite sure which one I was going out with, so... Bob has this very raw, natural, type of intelligence that I think I was attracted too. I always thought David was the best, right, of the three of them. I, I've said it before, you know, "I got the pick of the litter." Without a doubt, Eddy was the, um... handsomest of all the three triplets, you know. Of course, I'm partial but, you know, I adored him. When I met him, he was the last holdout. The Casanova of the three... and I said, "Oh boy, this guy's a real bachelor, like player." But he was so warm in his smile and he had wonderful beautiful hands, soft hands and when I shook his hand I mean, I just, I... You know, I just fell in love with him. I'm from a big colourful Irish catholic family and he was a Jewish guy. When he came to the house for the first time, he looked at my dad and he said, "I don't know if you know this, Mr Shanley, "I've been seeing Brenda every night pretty much "since the first day I met her." And I thought, "Oh my God, "my dad knows that, you know, we're together every night." And my dad just sort of, you know, looked at me like, "OK" and that was Eddy. - 'I do.' - 'I do.' 'We love you.' Everyone loved him. If there was a scale, Bobby would be reserved, David would be middle and Eddy was just the loveable, mushy, huggable, funny, you know, he just exuded warmth and love. 'Jamie's first Thanksgiving with Daddy.' - 'Hi, look who's here.' - 'Yes, Daddy.' 'Daddy decided to show up 'and make a special guest appearance.' ♪ 'Happy birthday, dear Jamie ♪ 'Happy birthday to you' ♪ He loved family gatherings. You know, Eddy really, really loved being around David and Bobby. Eddy seemed to get the most out of the three of them meeting. For whatever reason. He wanted his brothers and him to have a beautiful life and everyone to get along and he wanted everyone to be one big family. Eddy was absolutely the driving force in terms of leading the search for our birth mother. He got a fever and he just wanted to do it. And Alan was also rallying, because it was just an exciting thing to do. We figured what are the chances of having triplets born in New York on July 12th 1961. We figured out that New York public library shared birth records. We each grabbed a book and went page by page by page by page by page, and within a couple of hours, it was, "Bingo!" Male, male, male. Three in a row. All born July 12th 1961. Right next to it, birth mother's last name. The first meeting was a bar on like, 47th Street. It was like, her local neighbourhood watering hole on the East side, and it was awkward. She told the story of what happened. Unfortunately it wasn't a romantic story. She was a young girl. Basically, prom night knock up type thing. I don't think she ever got over the fact that she had triplets and had to give them up. You know, to us at 19, you drink like a fish, you think you're invincible. But we found it a little concerning that she was pretty much keeping up with us, you know. Um... the apple doesn't fall that far from the tree and if that's the tree, I was less than thrilled, and we had our parents already, so we met her and it was OK. But she was not a particularly close part of our lives. We were all young and starting our marriages and careers. 'Hi, welcome to Triplets.' 'David Kellman, Edward Galland and Robert Shafran 'are identical triplets. 'Now they run a New York restaurant called, 'what else, you guessed, Triplets.' 'Welcome. Hello. Welcome, welcome.' We had a lot of people who were coming for us. They came to see the triplets. They wanted to be waited on by one of the triplets. We served vodka frozen blocks of ice, and we'd get the whole room up and dancing. It was like this big party going on, it was like this big Bar Mitzvah. 'Triplets become wildly successful 'owning a restaurant 'in the Soho district of New York City.' We did over a million dollars first year. That's when things kinda got funky. In the mid-90s I started working on a story for "The New Yorker" magazine about identical twins reared apart. I've always thought, "What would it be like if you turned "the corner one day and you saw yourself?" In the process of my research, I came across this obscure scientific article. It referenced this secret study in which identical siblings had been separated. I was shocked and intrigued. They were separating identical babies at birth for the purpose of this scientific experiment. And these babies had all come from one adoption agency in New York City. 'The first thing out of my mouth 'was, "Were you adopted?"' 'There I am, this can't be real.' 'Twins separated at birth.' 'Eddy and Robert and David reunited after 19 years.' 'It's beautiful.' 'Blue-collar family, middle-class family 'and a more affluent family.' 'Adoptive parents should be told as much as is reasonable.' 'Something was just not right.' 'They were breaking open a bottle of champagne 'as if they had dodged a bullet.' 'All of us were adopted from Louise Wise.' 'Louise Wise.' 'And these babies had all come from Louise Wise Services.' Lawrence Wright called me and he told me all about the experiment. And I said, "This is like Nazi shit." It was kind of like reality hitting like a tidal wave. We were a science experiment. These people split us up and studied us like lab rats. We didn't recognise this stuff until it was put in our face, until it was in newsprint. But there were clues in the past. I remember from a very young age... people would come to the house... usually a young man and a young woman. And they had me taking tests. They did IQ tests, personality inventory tests, they did eye hand co-ordination tests. I do remember people coming to the house, having tests done, square pegs and round holes, and Rorschach ink block tests. "What does this mean to you?" that kind of stuff. Eddy told me that when he was younger, he remembers people watching him and taking notes, and they would ask him questions and he would get frustrated with the questions, and he remembers they were videotaping him. I remember the filming more than anything else. I remember having super 8mm films taken of me when I was on the swing set, or on the slide. Every single time they came they filmed. Riding my bike, throwing a ball, and they wanted to see how many times I could, you know, go on my pogo stick, roller-skating, throwing a Frisbee, shooting a bow and arrow, you know, they had my attention. I was performing. The stuff they did would be more complex as I got older. I felt weird about it, I didn't really understand why they needed to come so often, why were they asking me all these questions. Somewhere around age of nine or ten I started becoming less comfortable with it, and it was kinda like, "Mum, do I still have to do this? "Do I still have to do this?" When our parents adopted us they were each told that we were being followed as part of a normal study of the development of adopted children. They had no idea that we'd been separated. The agency said the children born in this period of time were all going to be in a normal study of adopted children. And, as far as we knew, that was it. That this was a new thing they were going to follow up with all the children and at the time we accepted it. You're talking about a group of people that went and held a baby and did psychological testing on a six-month-old baby, and then went to another house to see his brother, and then went to another house to see his brother, and did this over years and years and years and years with full knowledge that we were within a 100-mile radius, and not knowing each other. It's just unconscionable. Who would think that anybody would be evil enough to come up with something like this? In the process of my research, I learned is that the person really in charge of the study was Dr Peter Neubauer, very distinguished psychiatrist in New York, director of the Freud archives. He was an Austrian refugee from the Holocaust and he set up shop in New York and became, you know, one of the great men of psychiatry in America. What I learned is that people at the Louise Wise agency were separating identical siblings and then a team of scientists led by Neubauer would follow them. But it wasn't just the triplets. There were others. After my article came out another twin set discovered themselves. 'And here they are now. 'I appreciate you coming on the show today.' - 'Our pleasure.' - 'Paula and Elyse.' 'This amazing story is incredible. Is that the way to tell it?' 'It's funny. I mean, we say if it hadn't happened to us - 'we wouldn't believe it.' - 'This is a Disney movie.' 'It's a little darker than a Disney movie. 'I was at home in my apartment in Brooklyn 'with my two-year-old daughter, 'and the phone rings and I answer the phone 'and it was the adoption agency. "'We've got some news for you, you've got a twin sister. "And she's looking for you."' 'You were both editors of your high school paper, 'you both went to film school.' 'Well, it's funny because I don't know if you noticed...' 'Our mannerisms are inherited.' 'I contacted the adoption agency 'and I asked them, "Well, why we were separated?"' 'That's the million-dollar question of this story.' 'And they said, "For a twin study." 'We felt that our lives had been orchestrated 'by these scientific researchers 'who put their scientific needs, 'research needs or desires, their career interests 'before the needs of us, and the interests of us 'and other twins and triplets who were separated.' Nobody is sure of how many identical twins were involved in this study. I was told six to eight, but we don't really know. When you have a study like this, normally you produce the results and you show how large the sample is and all this sort of thing. But this study was never published. Which makes it all the more intriguing. We did have an attorney try to get us some of the study records. We received a small amount of information. It was very dry, technical data, that didn't really shed any light on the reasons for the study. It was garbage.
