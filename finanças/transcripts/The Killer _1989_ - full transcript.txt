Do you believe in God? No, but I enjoy the tranquility here. I feel comfortable just sitting here. Want to check the gun? I trust you. Get down! Don't move. I can't see. Your corneas have been badly damaged. -Will I recover? -There is hope, -but your eyesight will never be perfect. -Everything is so blurry. We can do an operation, a transplant. Will I become blind? Jennie, I'm Sergeant Tsang. Do you remember the murderer's face? Please, leave me alone. I'm so afraid. Calm down. Help! Help! Please help! Bastards! Don't touch me. They're gone already. Don't be afraid. I'll take you home. Jennie! How do you know my name? I listen to you sing every night. Who are you? I feel as if I know you. I know you can't see too well. I wanted to help you, but I didn't get the chance. In this world, not everybody is shady. Will you let me help you this time? I'll leave once I'm sure you're okay. Calm down. I'll check it out. It's just a cat. It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture. It's such a nuisance. Why did you turn off the light? You can see? I can only see shadows. It was better last month. I could see images. Turn on the light. It makes me feel safer. What are you doing now? I'm looking at this scarf. It has my blood stains on it. The man who shot me wrapped it around my eyes. I will never forget. Would you like some tea? No, thanks. It won't take a minute. Sit down, please. I'll put some music on. Hey, relax. You're acting like an undercover agent. Lighten up or your cover will be blown. Come on. Smile! Now, you look like someone out of an asylum. Tsang, Eddy is a lunatic. Be careful. Same to you, pal. Watch your ass. Eddy, sorry to keep you waiting. Who the hell is that? He's a good buddy. Say hello to Eddy. Hi, Eddy. Search him! Eddy, what's with the security? This isn't our first deal. I think I've seen him somewhere before. Two hundred thousand. We'll check the guns first. What are you guys doing? Nothing, sir. We're just chatting. Open the trunk. Open it! Quickly! Now! You bastard! You betrayed me! Are you a cop? Talk! I'm not a traitor. I didn't betray you. -If you aren't, then why is he here? -He's not a traitor! I bet my life on it, Eddy! He isn't a cop! Trust me! Eddy, he didn't set you up. Listen to me. -The guy is a cop. I recognize him! -You've got it wrong. Tsang, I'll get him. That shithead! Shit! Stay back! Don't move! Goddamn ass... Finish your sentence. Asshole... Inspector Li, the suspect Eddy Wong had a hostage in a crowded tram. Could you see him clearly? -Could you? -Yes. Why did you shoot? Instinct. Did you consider the safety of the passengers? Did you give any warning before you pulled the trigger? There was no time for that. The hostage had a coronary thrombosis. She died of a heart attack. Her family made an official complaint. You're responsible for her death. That's crazy, how could I know she had a heart condition? I've been on Eddy Hung's case for seven months. The guy was a maniac. He would shoot anybody for any reason. Should I have waited till he killed her? You forgot that I had just seen him kill a cop. Who's responsible for that cop's death? Fine. Do whatever you want. I'm used to all sorts of complaints. Another one wouldn't make a difference. Catch! I thought your hand would have healed by now. It's hopeless. You better use it more. It's no use. A one-handed killer is useless. I've had my day. His name is Wong Dong Yun. He works with a drug ring in Central America. Who wants him dead? No questions. Take it or leave it. One and a half million. That seems high. This is my last job. All right, it's a deal. The money doesn't matter. These guns are clean. They don't have serial numbers. They're untraceable. Explosive head bullets, your favorite. It's easy to pick it up. It's hard to put it down. Want to change your mind? Why take this job? This one is for Jennie. If she doesn't have a cornea transplant soon, she might lose her eyesight forever. There is a cornea bank in Hong Kong. But it's always empty. When a donation does come in, there's someone else who gets it first. So we're going to try abroad. KAU YAN CHURCH I have to leave you for a few days. When I return, I'll take you overseas for surgery. You must come back. I promise. Thanks! Many VIPs and government officers will attend the opening ceremony of today's Dragon Boat Festival. You are assigned to protect them. Their information is in your files. Everyone, stay alert and be extra careful. How could such a scum of a person need our protection? Attention, please! To all the competitors, please gather in front of the podium for the Dotting of the Dragon's Eyes ceremony. It's our pleasure to welcome the president of Tung Yuan Financial Corporation, Mr. Wong, the Legco councilor, Mr. Chow Si Ming, the chairman of the Rotary Club, Mr. Peter Chu, the president of the Professional Womenâ€™s Association, Ms. Lee Lam Mung Chu, and many other VIPs. Many of whom are our movie stars and pop idols. After the ceremony, the final match of the dragon boat race will begin. We hope that all the athletes will try their best to win! Good luck! -Mr. Wong! -Mr. Wong! Faster. Good luck. Mr. Wong, please begin. Okay. Keep everything under control. Red alert! Wong Dong Yun has been shot on the floating platform. The shot came from the water. The murderer is nearby. MARINE REGION 39 All units, begin searching. Mr. Wong just fainted. Everything is all right. Please enjoy your day. Tsang! Quick! Don't lose him! Tsang, there's an explosion over there! Something is going on! Right, let's check it out! Tsang, we can't lose him now! Freeze! Don't be afraid. You'll be all right. Don't cry. He's down there. Step on it! Okay! Are there any hospitals nearby? You think he's got a conscience? He won't let the little girl die. Nurse, where's the emergency room? This way. What happened? She got shot. Put her down, quickly! Nurse, check her blood pressure. Prepare her for surgery. We have to save her, fast. Oxygen mask. How is she? How are her pulse and blood pressure? She has a weak pulse. Her blood pressure is low. Did a man carrying a little girl come here? -He's in the emergency room. -Detain anyone suspicious. Mister, are you related to the patient? How was she wounded? Sir, you can't leave now. I have to take down your name. Where is he? I'm an inspector. Just carry on. Right. Nurses, ignore them. Yes. Don't mind them. Save the girl. Yes. Don't disturb the doctor. Put your guns down. -What happened? -There was a gunshot. -Where did it come from? -Over there! Get everybody out. I'll call Headquarters. Any progress on Wong's case? No, there's none at all. I almost got the suspect. But he escaped. I thought you had a razor-sharp intuition? I'm being made to look a fool, so this case is really important to me. If we do well, it will benefit both of us. You won't have another opportunity like this for the rest of your career. Do me a favor and prove me wrong. Sir, I don't do things for anybody. I'll get the murderer. I won't humiliate you. I hope you don't forget who helped you reach the top. I want you to draw the suspect. Try to bring him to life. He's over 30. He has some wrinkles around his eyes. There's something heroic about him. He's a bit different from your average murderer. He's very calm and quite intelligent. His eyes are very alert. Full of compassion. Full of passion. Hello. It's me. It's Ah Jong. Ah Jong? Why haven't you left town? I want my money now. I want it tonight. Tonight! Sure, I'll bring it over tonight. Mr. Wong! You should let me handle Ah Jong. You shouldn't have sent people to kill him. -What if he betrays me? -He's not that kind of guy. I don't trust anyone. Including you! I know the rules of the game. I'll do what I promised. I'm not interested in rules. I care about the methods. If he exposes his identity, kill him. I'm the boss now, so do things my way. Okay. Kill him for me. If you fail, you're dead. After all, you got paid to do it. Li Ying, this could be a lead. Six months ago, Wong's partner, Jeung Wan, was killed by a professional gunman. The killer was never caught, but he accidentally blinded a singer. What is her name? Jennie. She hasn't recovered yet. Life is cheap. It only takes one bullet. He isn't an ordinary assassin. I hope we're looking for just one man. If I'm not mistaken, this man isn't a cold-blooded murderer. It only takes one bullet, cold-blooded killer or not. He risked his life to save the little girl. And if he did hurt the singer by accident, he must have contacted her. Ah Jong? I'm not Ah Jong. I'm sorry. I can't see clearly. I thought you were my friend. That was a beautiful song. Can you sing it again? I only sing for one person. Ah Jong? Your singing is full of emotion. After listening to it, I feel like I know your friend already. I wish he was here now. Wherever he may be, you are in his thoughts. But a part of him will always be here. You don't trust me anymore? You know why? Of course. People in our profession are not supposed to trust anyone. How did they know I would go to that beach? I might have been followed when I drove the car there. It was my fault. Who wants me dead? Why do you ask? You know the rules. Why didn't you run after the job? I don't have my money yet. Who wants to kill me? If you hadn't exposed your identity, he wouldn't have wanted you dead. Answer me. Who wants to kill me? Answer me first. Do you have any bullets left? I always save the last bullet. Either for myself, or for my enemy. It's Hay Wong Hoi. Wong Dong Yun's nephew. He wants you dead. He hired you to kill his uncle. Do you really have one last bullet? Ah Jong, thank you for sparing me. We are in the same boat now. There's no way out for us. I never want to see you again. Inspector Li! Inspector Li, there are five dead witnesses. It was him. This can't be a coincidence. Show his picture to the neighbors and ask them if he was here. Inspector Li, you got it! The neighbors said that he lives here. Are you crazy? Jennie. Ah Jong, is it you? Why haven't you come back? I'm going to get your medicine first. Then I'm going to take you somewhere else. Why? Moving to less polluted surroundings would be better for your eyes. Okay. It would be ideal if I could move close to the sea. I want to see the sea and the clear blue sky. Great, pack your things and wait for me. I'll wait for you. You didn't leave Hong Kong when you had the chance. What stopped you? Are you the new janitor? -Yes, ma'am? -You're not doing your job properly. This is a fire escape. -You're throwing the trash everywhere. -Okay. -Okay, sorry. -What will we do when there's a fire? You better move it, quick! I pay my maintenance fee every month. You're so lazy! -I'm reporting you to the main office. -I'm moving it already? -Don't leave any garbage here. -You bet, ma'am. Throw it all away. Shit. Ah Jong, you're back. Yes, Jennie. Are you with a friend? Yes, he used to play football with me. We grew up in the same squatter's area. Yes. He's... I'm Dumbo. He's Shrimp Head. You call each other that? Yes. It's good to see you again. The feeling isn't mutual. You're not pleased to see your friend? We're not that close. He's been causing me a lot of trouble. I'm here to sort it out. Have a seat. Let me make you some tea. -No need. -No need. It's nothing. -Please be careful. -That's right. I know how to do it. I won't hurt myself. Ah Jong, take care of Dumbo while I make the tea. Dumbo, make yourself at home. Okay, Shrimp Head. Ma'am, why are you so concerned about the garbage? He paid me one thousand bucks to keep you talking. Hey, don't walk out on me now! We aren't finished yet. Don't leave! You're going to lose this game. Am I? Let's wait and see. You're always the loser. Not this time. I'm well-prepared. Let's put your preparedness to the test. Are you always so determined? Yes, that's my style. Mine too! So we have something in common. Are you trying to say that we're both good at soccer? I don't think so. For sure. Have some tea while you talk about the old times. Thanks, Jennie. Be careful with the tea. Jennie, please entertain Dumbo. Here's your tea. -Thank you. -My pleasure. Is he another friend of yours? No. He's the janitor. We don't have a janitor in this building. Oh, he's the plumber. He wants to help fix the drain. There's a leak in the water pipe outside. Dumbo, your voice is so familiar. Have we met somewhere before? I met you in the nightclub. You didn't want to sing the song I really liked. Oh, I remember. What a coincidence! Dumbo, take care of Jennie for a while. I'm going to the bathroom. Me too. There's another bathroom in the bedroom. Jennie, there's a rat! A rat? It's in the kitchen. I'll catch it. Hey, don't shoot! It's me! Don't shoot! Somebody down there is aiming at my ass! Jennie! What happened? Where's Ah Jong? I know you and Ah Jong lied to me. Tell me the truth! Who the hell are you? I'm a cop. Ah Jong is a professional killer. He murdered somebody. I've been after him for months. I don't believe you. Jennie! Listen to me, Jennie. -No, I won't! -Jennie, it's true. Tsang! Jennie, calm down. Listen, please! Sit down. Six months ago, Ah Jong shot your face by accident. Now, Triads wants him dead. I don't believe it. I want to help, but I can't in my position. I hope you'll cooperate with us. Jennie. We're going to use you as bait. If I can arrest Ah Jong, I can help save his life. It's better than being killed by Triads. Name your price, I just want him dead! He was seen on the job. I want him dead. The sooner, the better. Deposit a hundred thousand into my account now. Another two hundred thousand upon completion. No money, no action, Mr. Wong. Not even if there's someone with their finger on the trigger, ready to blow your head off. Get the hundred grand into his account. -Yes. -Mr. Wong! You're dead, and you still have the guts to see me? You should pay Ah Jong. He won't give up until he gets his money. So what? Is he going to shoot me? I've got men all over the streets. We'll see what happens! You're the boss. You should keep your word. Don't talk crap. I'm not going to pay him, even if you beg. Mr. Wong, let me keep my word. Let me pay him what I promised. Then I'll bring him to you. Mr. Wong, if it pleases you, I will beg. You're a real pain in the ass! If you weren't a Triads elder, I would kick you. Who is he? He's just an insignificant nobody! Why are you doing all of this for Ah Jong? He's not as simple as you thought. Don't mention him again! Come here, now! Mr. Wong has been shot. Kill him! Kill him! Don't let him go! Mr. Wong, you're injured! Go back! Just kill him! Let's go! You're in danger. Go after him! If you consider me your friend, kill me now. I loathe seeing you demean yourself by begging. Though I didn't succeed, I will still risk my life to get you your money. If I could kill you with one bullet, I wouldn't have to kneel in front of people and beg. Of course, I'm ashamed of myself! The world has changed. You and I are no longer suited for the Triad lifestyle. Perhaps we are too nostalgic. Nostalgia is one of our saving graces. At least, when I die, I'll know I was remembered by a friend. Let's settle our dues in the next life. One can't think like that when it comes to friends. Otherwise, what are friends for? Right? A drink? Thank you. Jennie had always wanted to live by the sea. You've done so much for her. I wonder how she feels about you. -Hello? -Jennie! Ah Jong, why did you leave me? You didn't say goodbye. I'm sorry. I had something to do. We've got to leave tonight. Tonight? Dr. Ho called this afternoon. He's reserved a pair of corneas, but they're in Singapore. We have to be there by midnight, or they automatically to go someone else. All right, I'll take you there. I've booked tickets for tonight. I'll wait for you at the airport. You must come. Of course. Do you think he'll come? Will you go? I trust her. Everybody's here. Let's go. How is it going? Keep an eye on all exits and corridors. Stay alert, everyone. Everything's ready. If he dares to come here, he will never escape. Don't worry. We'll take care of everything while you are away. Thank you. Please have a good journey! Take good care of the company business while I'm gone. -Have a nice trip. -Have a nice trip. Please take care. Ah Jong! Get away from here! Run! She's crazy! -Ah Jong. -Have a safe journey! The cops are everywhere. Run away! Ah Jong, the cops want you. Don't come near me. Ah Jong, are you there? Run! Don't let them catch you. Are you alone? Run, Ah Jong! The cops are after you. Freeze! Ah Jong, the cops are all over the place. Ah Jong, the cops are everywhere! Escape! Please get away! Ah Jong, run! It's me, Jennie! Don't move. -Don't move. -Freeze. Let's go. What is it, Officer? Flirting is not a crime. Arrest him! Get out of the way! Let me through! Don't move! Stop! Stop! We have to check that luggage. Who are you? We're sorry... Open those suitcases. What were you doing at the airport? Chasing tail! What is your job? I'm a casting agent for movie companies. -Why did you run and resist arrest? -I was drunk. Stand up and walk a straight line. Where is your friend? What friend? I know that you people live your life by a code of honor. I would want a friend like you, too. Help him. Tell me where he is. I want to help him solve his problem. I have some questions to ask him. That's none of my business. But if the guy you're talking about is my friend, then I'm sure he doesn't need your help. From now on, you're off Wong's case. Inspector Chan will take over. I'm assigning you to a new case. I want an explanation. I don't trust you. Siding with the suspect is not the way to catch him. Sir, you don't understand how I work. That's right. That's why you're off the case. I won't give up the investigation. Bullshit! Tsang, you're now Chan's assistant. Release the man now. Give him a 20-hour surveillance. He'll lead us to Wong's assassin. You got that? Will you kill again? I thought the people I killed deserved to die. Now, I think it doesn't matter. No, I won't kill again. I hope I can keep my promise. I've been followed. Wong's men. The cops, too. Don't worry, I took care of them. Wong has hired Paul Yau to kill you. Don't worry, you can use my guns and ammo. Where are you going? To get your money from Wong. I'll meet you at the church. Are you going alone? Yes, of course. I have to keep my promise. Wong is not going to hurt me, I still deserve some respect. Fung Sei, I don't need the money. I need your friendship. Tsang! Tsang! I followed him to Horizon Drive 6. I almost got him. I know. -Don't worry. -I could have gotten him... Don't worry, I'll find him. Tsang, don't worry. Li Ying... You can't win all the time but you can't keep losing either. Tsang! Inspector Li, did he give us anything? Go ask him yourself! Ah Jong! Jennie. What is it? Why is it so dark this morning? It's just a cloudy day. Relax, it will be all right. Are we leaving now? Yes. Freeze! Who is it? It's Dumbo. What does he want? He has come to say goodbye. What are you waiting for? I'm a cop. I don't shoot people in the back. So we're the same in another way. No, we're not the same! I uphold the law. You break it! Tsang Yeh died because of you. I swore I would get you this time. I'm sorry. But I won't let you put me in prison. If you must take revenge for your friend, shoot me now. Don't force me to kill you. So you really will kill me? I won't let you go this time. Okay, let's see. You can't win all the time. Ah Jong, where are you? Ah Jong... Where's Dumbo? Where is he? Right in front of you. -Don't take him away. -Jennie! Ah Jong has promised me that he'll never kill again. Put that gun down. Jennie, put that gun down. Not unless he leaves us alone. I beg you, please, let us go! -I'll never let you arrest him! -Jennie! Did I kill him? Is he dead? I didn't mean to kill him. I didn't mean it. He's all right. I didn't mean to... He's all right. Calm down. Be brave. -Stay there! -Ah Jong! Let's get out of here, then you can arrest me. Let's get Jennie out of here. The car is outside. Come! I won't let you put me behind bars. Throw the gun down. I know you won't kill a cop. Thank you. You could have killed me with one shot. I don't kill anybody until I know they are the real enemy. Do you really know me? Sometimes fate controls everything. So the only person who really knows me turns out to be a cop. You could always give up. No. I've made a promise. I keep my word. Sometimes I really envy your freedom. I just don't have it. I believe in justice, but nobody trusts me. I have the same problem. You're an unusual cop. And you're an unusual killer. I'm sorry to drag you into this mess. Tell me. Who is behind all this? That's not how I work. I play by the rules. I knew you would never tell me. Take care of Jennie. Wong won't stop until he kills you. You had better let me arrest you. We'll stay here tonight. Fung Sei will bring me my money and we'll leave tomorrow. I'm scared those gangsters will find us here. Don't worry. This place is out of the way. Why is it so dark? I can hardly see anything. Ah Jong, turn on the lights, please. Why don't you turn on the lights? Ah Jong. Ah Jong, turn on lights. The power has been cut. Will your friend come back with the money? I'm sure he will. Boss, the money for Paul has already been prepared. Do you think Paul Yau will be able to kill Ah Jong? Boss, Fung Sei is here. If he betrays you again, then what? I would still treat him as my friend. He was so good to me. Where is Ah Jong's money? Where the hell is he? I wish I could have a friend like you. You will, one of these days. Drop your guns! Your right hand still works? Yes, well enough. It can still fire a gun, fast and accurate. You've got no way out. Why are you doing all this? Tell me, what's the alternative? Where's the money? Give it to him! I'm one step ahead. Why didn't you shoot me in the head? Maybe I'm just not a professional anymore. I wish I could start all over again. It's a pity... Give me the cash. Where is Ah Jong? Give me the money first. We owe it to him. Hypocrite! Do all killers have a sense of honor? Our world is changing so fast. Honor is worthless nowadays. Sometimes I think you're not human. You're more like a dog. At least we have one thing in common. We both use guns in our jobs. We just have different reasons. Right? In some ways, dogs are superior to men. If you don't tell me where Ah Jong is, consider this your funeral. Throw this garbage away. Give me the money. Are you sure you still have bullets? You want to bet? Ah Jong said, always save one last bullet, either for yourself, or your enemy. Turn around! Turn around! Goddamn it! -Get him! -Yes, sir! I want you to promise me one thing. If I don't make it, take me to a hospital. Get the doctors to operate. My corneas are for Jennie. If you can't do that, give her the money and send her abroad for surgery. Are there no other choices? This is the first decent thing I've ever done. Are you going to help me? What's that noise? Did someone arrive? Come here. Fung Sei. Here's your money. I fought for it like a man. It's important to be able to settle matters for a friend. Fung Sei, you didn't have to do this. Come on! He said I was a dog. Now, I'm not sure if I'm human or a dog. Fung Sei, they have no right to say that. Fung Sei! Fung Sei! Fung Sei... Am I a dog? No. You're not a dog. You're a man. We're outmoded characters, outcasts of our community. I don't want to die like a dog. But, you see, I didn't keep one last bullet. I... I have one. -Ah Jong! -Stay here and don't move. Don't leave me alone. What are you going to do? Force my way out! Don't kill anymore, please! Give up your guns and come with me. You want me to give up? I could even kill my best friend. You dare tell me to give up? When Tsang Yeh died, I wanted to kill you too! But now, I don't want you to get killed. Get out of here with Jennie. How? They'll chase me to the ends of the earth. I have nowhere to go! Get out there and tell them you're a cop! See if they give up their guns! -Jennie! -Ah Jong! Ah Jong! Dumbo! Thanks, Shrimp Head! Dumbo, I owe you. You don't owe me anything. This is the gift of friendship. Good luck! Jennie, don't run! Don't move! Jennie! Jennie! Dumbo! Give me the gun! Shrimp Head, here! How good of a shot are you? I'm a cop, I've got to be good! Even after being friends for so long, I don't even know your name. Is it important? Whether we win or lose, you're not going to be around. I would like to have a name to remember you by. Would you rather see me dead or set free? If fate spares us, I don't want either. So you do care about me! Didn't you nickname me Shrimp Head? My friend! Leave her alone. She's innocent! Move! Move! Drop your gun! Drop your gun! Damn it! You hear me? Hurry up! Ah Jong! Where are you, Ah Jong? Jennie, don't be afraid, I'm in front of you. Drop your gun. Jennie, don't move an inch! Don't hurt her. No, I won't hurt her. I'll just kill her. Release her! Don't make any dumb moves! Let the girl go first! No way! What if I don't? Drop your guns! Dumbo. Will you do as you've promised? No problem. Don't forget. There's always a friend to back you up! Drop the guns, or I'll kill her. Drop your gun, idiot! Shrimp Head! Shrimp Head! Shrimp Head! Ah Jong! Jennie! Ah Jong, where are you? Ah Jong! Ah Jong! Don't move! Okay! I surrender! I'll cooperate! Arrest me, please! You're an unusual cop. And you're an unusual killer. I believe in justice, but nobody trusts me. I have the same problem. Arrest him. -Yes, sir! -I'll do it! Arrest me! I'm asking for police custody! I'll cooperate... Shrimp Head... Shrimp Head... Shrimp Head...
