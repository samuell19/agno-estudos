Produced by Nagashima Tairiku Film Committee I should have put on more clothes. It was cold this morning. -Were you sleeping naked? -Busted. Wear your panties at least. Stop it! They're coming back! It's ready. Phew. Thank you. Let's eat. Thank you for the food. Towa. When you're at the port, don't forget to thank your dad. Good. Delicious. There. Boss, shall I open the shop? Please. Oh, good morning. Please come in. Welcome. Nagashima Tairiku Market diner Good morning, Towa! -Morning. -Morning. -School? -Yes. -Towa! -Coming! -See you later. -Have a good day. Dad! Hey Towa. Pay attention to teachers. Have a good day. Your noodles. Sorry for the wait. Over here. Sorry I spilt a little. Do you mind? Where are my noodles? -Coming. -Croquettes are ready. Pardon? -He got dumped yesterday. -Not true. Would you take him out sometime? Sure. After the sunset Tap on the side for a better sound. On the side. Not like that. Yes, you've got it! Bye. See you tomorrow! I'm home! These barrel drums come from where I was born. When Towa's dad was your age, He was so excited. He looked his best at the festival. I can do it, too! Oh my. Very good, work hard as his heir. -Check the taste for me. -Sure. Sorry I'm late. -Good? Sure? -Yes. Welcome. -Let me see her. -Sure. So sweet. Lovely Sana. She is really cute. A new born. Tell you the truth, I've been unwell because of the fertility treatment. I can't even work. I'm thinking of giving up. Don't worry about the work. But I need to draw the line somewhere. It's expensive, too. We also spent this much. Three million yen? That's nothing to boast about. But money is not the reason. It's like chasing a moving goal post forever. Your body and mind go to pieces. Yes. When granny told me to stop, I was gutted but so relieved and I almost cried. It's good you made up your mind. Now you have Towa. Help me! Towa, come and help here. Must I? Yes, you must. Quickly, take this. What bad manners. No pinching. Smells so good. Try some, come on. Let me have one. Careful. Pour it properly. What are you doing? Thanks to you, we can have a good New Year. It's not just me. I'm so glad you came back to the island. You've made a great success of the fish farm. Really well done. I only carried on what my dad started. But things have changed a lot since then. Dad used to say yellowtail farming is like gambling. That hasn't changed. True. The red tide wiped us out. That was hard. Me, too, I got done first time. That was really hard. Cheer up. Let's have a drink. Let's drink and be merry. Let's have a toast! -Satsuki, you, too. -I'm OK. -Go on. -But tomorrow... Kiyoshi. Go Kiyoshi. You've got heavier again. Thank you for coming. What, you have two? Kyota has three. I'm defeated. That's not a competition! Don't worry. Akane! Towa. -Hello. -Good afternoon. Towa, let's go to the dentist. -No way! -Catch you! Tooth decay? One up top and on the bottom. Bummer. Adult teeth will come through soon. Don't worry. Still a blow for a parent. I heard parent's saliva causes baby tooth decay. Towa didn't eat much when he was a baby. So I chewed food for him. I kissed him a lot, too. Satsuki and Akane. Here, as I promised. Thanks. Can I ask you... Akane, are you on a break? Would you like a drink? I still need to finish up. Of course. I might have something to eat. -Hideyuki! -Sorry. Are you still open? So obvious. It's just a matter of time before he's rejected. -Towa, that was so good, wasn't it? -Yes. I washed Towa. Towa, it's time for bed. I want to play a game with daddy. No games until your teeth are fixed. -It's fixed. -Open up and show me. -I don't want to. -Wait. -Let's play cards with granny? -Yes. Towa! It's nice. What is this? From Hideyuki. "Child Adoption application" Ah, finally. We wanted to do this much sooner. There was the fish farm. The treatment cost, too. We wanted to pay off the debt first. Document screening first, then interview at the Family Court. Not looking forward to it. We will be fine. What's this? I'm going to take it to the interview. A picture is worth a thousand words. So cute, brings back memories. We still need the birth mother's consent. It will be fine. Child Consultation Center has the parental rights so it should be fine. We should tell uncles about the adoption. Mother 's declaration to the relatives. Sure. So cute. Brings back memories. -I won! -I'm going to sleep. If you go to sleep with a frown, you will have a bad dream. Come here, give me your hand. Granny drank all your bad feeling. -So you will have a good dream. -That's not true. Wait, Towa. Smile for me. Smile. A little bit more. Come on, Towa. Smile. You look best when you smile. Time to sleep. Thank you. Akane! See you tomorrow. Good work. What's up? This way. Perfect place to daydream. When my parents had a fight, mum used to bring us here to calm down. Dad was always drunk and didn't go fishing. The sea is too rough or the tide wasn't right. He always had excuses. While mum cried, we swam in the sea. You know, the sea is calmest and warmest after the sun has set. A place with a lot of memories. Not good memories. Anyway, if you're worried about something, I will listen. Everyone is talking, who will get that pretty girl. Don't... Have you settled down here? Thank you. It's been a year. Already? Towa is working hard on the Taiko drums. He takes his sticks everywhere. It's like living with a monster. He's going camping soon so he's really excited. Thank you. He was so happy yesterday and couldn't go to sleep. -So cute. -Indeed. This one is 4.4 kg. 4.8 4.1 4.0 4.5 4.1 3.8 Who wants to play the statute game? Me! Daruma doll fell over. Daruma doll fell over. You moved. He's coming! Hurry! Run! -No! She's close! -Who, the chaser? You are too far. You are so quick! Are you OK? Towa, you were looking out over the sea earlier. Yes. Do you miss home? Yes, I wondered if I can see dad's fish farm. I couldn't. I see. By the way, -Shall we take a selfie? -Yes. -Do I press here? -Yes. Cheese. When Towa rode a bike for the first time. That was brilliant. His face was like this. Yes. He was so excited and he almost wet himself. The night before his first day at school, he was so nervous and wet his bed. He is so sweet. Thank you. We're finally on a date but we're still talking about the same old stuff. I'm always telling Towa off these days. I don't like it. I've become like my mother. What do you mean? You are a mother. I'm a father, it's obvious isn't it? Towa... I wonder if he's gone to sleep. He would have kicked off his covers. The other day I played hide-and-seek with Towa. He is really good at hiding, you know. I couldn't find him for a long time. I was scared he may have really gone. It was just a game. When he came out of the storage, I cried. Cradle my baby down to sleep Sings a canary sweet and high Sweet baby, sleep baby Good-night lullaby Thank you very much. Well done. Take care. Thank you. -Towa, it was fun, wasn't it? -Yes. Something's on your hair. Bed hair? Just bed hair. Towa! Mum! Welcome back. I caught 40 fish. I was the best. But you don't like fish miso soup. I do. I had some the other day. Then would you like to go on dad's boat next time? Yes. If you can get up in the morning, that is. -I will get up! -But you always sleep in. Bye. I remember when I was in your tummy. Really? Like what? I was floating in water like in a bath. Then there was a jolt and I hit my head. I see. Mum, can I have an ice cream? No, you've cleaned your teeth. Time for bed. -Mean. -Let's go home. Good evening. It's open. ОK. Towa, good night. Hideyuki, good night. Give me more respect. Mr. Niimi or Hideyuki san would do. Towa! When Towa isn't at home, we're seeing someone from the Child Consultation Center Can you come, too? Sure. Beside, I made the initial introduction. As a town hall official, I will support you. Don't talk about stuff like his tooth decay and me kissing him and so on. Of course, trust me! Were you OK sleeping on your own at the camp? Sure. Akane was there. Did she sleep with you? Yes, she was playing mother. Towa, give me a kiss. Why! -How about a hug? -Sure. I went to 'Grand Off' yesterday. That's nice. How is your daughter? They come back occasionally. No need to worry about your potato field then. -Thanks to you. -Glad to hear it. Hey, hey, hello! Is Akane at the diner today? Not today. She's got a cold. Cold... I should go and check on her. Go and see her. She will be pleased. What shall I bring with me? -Akane. -Mr. Niimi. I heard you are off work. This is for you. Sorry, I'm not dressed properly. No problem. Would you like some tea? I was just passing but... So tidy. Much nicer than before you moved in. - Not really. -It's true. How are you feeling? So so. I recommend the clinic by the town hall. The old doctor retired and his son came back from a big hospital. Tea is ready. Thank you. Thank you for the tea. You came to this island because you heard about the island's project, right? So surprised because a young and pretty girl like you came alone. Not that young. I was just tired of working in a big city. Please. Is this what I brought earlier? Thank you. You are late. You know where the accents should be. Pay attention to it. Akane! - It's been a while. -Thank you for coming Please come in. -Please. -Thank you. Hello. Please. Mr. Yoshida. Towa is energetic and almost cheeky. He says he got teeth decay because he kisses his mum. Enough. Special adoption is for a child of up to 8 years old. I'm glad Towa is just in time. Thank you for your support since the foster parent training. We can be a family. I still can't believe it. We are a family already. What about biological mother's consent? Actually we don't know where she is. She used to work at a factory in Tokyo? She left four years ago. What happens to the adoption, then? We can still go ahead, can't we? Biological mother's parental rights are suspended, right? True. Family court will make a favorable decision for you. Um... Can you tell us more about Towa and his biological mother, please? Of course nothing will change our mind about adoption. I was going to tell you today. This is from the Child Consultation Center in Tokyo and information we gathered. Seven years ago at an internet café in Tokyo an abandoned baby was taken into custody. Abandoned! May I? The mother left a 3-month old baby in a room at an internet cafe and attempted suicide from a building nearby. Mother and baby were both malnourished. Poverty may have motivated the mother. Towa was severely dehydrated. He was found just in time. Awful... The mother was sentenced to one year in prison with a three-year suspension. The accused, or the biological mother was from Tokyo, unemployed, called Akane Sato. She was 23 at the time, so she should be 30 now. Akane Sato? Akane Sato... At the diner? She can't be. Do you know her? There is someone with the same name on the island. That could be an unlikely coincidence... No, it can't be her. Because the biological mother doesn't know Towa is on Nagashima. She should only know he is in the prefecture. She must have looked for him. She found the address and came to the island a year ago. No. Why did I not think of that. If that is the case, we need to enquire mother's will. Satsuki. Calm down. Towa's Baby Diary Satsuki, where're you going! I'm going to pick up Towa. He'll be back soon. Aren't you worried? If Towa is gone, I... I will look for him. You stay here. Mr. Yoshida from the Center will come back another time. We need to check the facts. Satsuki, calm down. Satsuki! Smells delicious! -Almost ready. -I'll help. Don't worry, you can take it easy. I always help at home. -Really? -Yes. This might be ready. -Are you ready? -Yes. -Upsy. -Got it. -One more. -Looks yummy! -Ready? -Yes. -Some sauce over it. -Here. Mind your hand. -How much? -A little more. More? I'll give you plenty. Towa. -It's ready. -OK. There you go. Thank you for the food. -Eat as much as you like. I have more. -OK. Towa! Mum! Why are you here? Akane, what is this? Let's go home. I bumped into Towa on the way home. Shoes. Hurry up. It wasn't by chance you came to this island, was it? Is it you... Towa's... How come... As I suspected... you are... Towa's...! Why did you keep it a secret! I knew I had to tell sometime. Have you told Towa...? Satsuki and family know it all. You've been selfish! Say sorry. You must be hungry. Come inside. Towa, give me the sieve. Here. Thank you. Why was mum so angry? You didn't do anything bad. Mum's eyes were like demon's. Sometimes you need to be a demon. You don't need to worry about anything. -OK. -That's right. When I went home, there were two new dogs. Mum brought them home. So inconsiderate. -Surrogate grandchildren? -Perhaps. Please leave. Let me explain. Why did you keep quiet? Were you planning to snatch him? Why..? Leave this island right now. Four years ago... I looked for him. Everywhere. I knew the moment I saw him. That's Towa. It was dazzling. Towa, you and Yuichi. Just like the family I dreamt about. I was relieved from the bottom of my heart. I wanted to see him the next day, the next, and the next... I couldn't leave the island. And now... What? I want to be him mum again. No one will allow that! Please I beg you, give him back to me. You abandoned Towa! You're not fit to be a mum! What do you mean we can't proceed? Akane Sato filed to revoke the suspension of parental rights. Family court may rule to give her back the parental rights. What happens then? Ms. Sato wishes to live with Towa. It's not easy to say this. But we will have to give up adoption. No way! You congratulated us, too. Are we not good enough? You are excellent foster family. In that case! Satsuki! Mrs. Hino. Let's think together. We need to put Towa's happiness first. Do you... What? Do you remember when we first met Towa? Yes. He was so small but he smiled at us. That was it for me and you. This child was waiting for us. We couldn't have children and we struggled. But it was all so that we can be with this child. When we became Towa's foster family, I was so happy. You cried, too. So unlike you. True. Towa is part of me. I can't give him back. I'm his father, too. It feels unfair but we are only foster parents. It doesn't matter! He is our son. Akane. Akane. Sorry, would you like some more? Are you OK? Has something happened? Love sickness. Are you going out with someone? Seconds for noodles. Refill, please! Welcome... Welcome. How long are you going to stay here? There is no place for you on this island. I beg you, please clear off. I gave birth to him. When I leave here, he is coming with me. Clear off! Stop, what are you doing, Satsuki! Leave! Stop this! Satsuki! I'm sorry. Tokyo? Why you? Leave it to Hideyuki. I want to know about Towa's life from before. Let me go. I want to know all about him. There would be things better not to know. Let her go if that makes her feel better. Mother... You go and see where Towa was born. Are you ready for it? I want to know all about Towa and I want to be his true mother. Towa, you are up early. I made rice balls for you. Have some with granny and dad later. Where are you going? Relatives in Kagoshima wants me to come. Don't worry. How naughty or babyish you may be I'm always thinking of you so much! I'll be back straight away, so wait for me with daddy and granny. I'll bring something back for you. Promise me one thing. While I'm away, don't see Akane. Please. Look after Towa. Of course. Don't cause a trouble there. OK. -Keep an eye on her. -Sure. Safe journey. Give me a hug. OK. I'm off. We are off. Thank you. Bye. We are off. Drive safely. Towa. Satsuki. Sorry for the wait. I'm Maekawa, a child consultation officer. Thank you for seeing us. Thank you for coming. I see. No idea she went to Nagashima. Yes. Anything. Please tell me anything about back then. We have passed this case to the agency in Kagoshima already but... There was a lot of backlash on the internet. Devil mother, neglect... It's not like she didn't like children. Or she flipped... Nothing like that. She suffered domestic violence during pregnancy from her partner. The man ran off before she gave birth. Wasn't anyone there to help Towa? If I were there... When people are in the midst of poverty and loneliness they don't even know how to get help. We'd like to reach out to them before then but... Excuse me... You've exceeded your time limit... One hour extension, please. Is one hour enough? Certainly. Towa. Say hello. Hello. At a place like this... Towa was... Hey, you there! This way, please. Kagoshima? -Nagashima. -Yes. Good morning. I remember her well. She worked well. But she kept to her self, didn't want to be with others. How long was she here? For all of the suspension period. So three years. She attended the rehabilitation program for mothers diligently. She obtained a sewing qualification, too. Did she talk about her child? No, but when they have a lot on their mind, it shows in sewing. Troubled mind shows. So when I sense something is up, I try to talk to them. All kinds of girls come here. Some with a huge debt. Some are disowned by their family. This is... a work record kept by Ms. Sato. Individual Daily Work Report, April 2012 Group A, Akane Sato One year old today. Milk is in after all this time. My breasts are like rocks. Breasts hurt again. It soon calmed down this time. I can't forget last night's dream. I dreamed about the birth. Reinstatement of parental rights denied. Where is Towa? I want to see him. Where is Towa? Where are you hiding? "The scar on my tummy still hurts". "Only proof for Towa was born". If you like. Thank you. Everyone got so much better. I also leaned the drum when I was little. I have no children of my own, but I know every child on the island. Little ones in nappies are playing the drums like that already. No wonder I'm getting older. Come together. Let's practice. See you. - Thank you. -Welcome. Hurry up. Let's go. -Ready. -O-kay! What's up with that face, what happened to your mojo? You brought that thing home. It's bad luck. -No. -Satsuki. -You can't throw this away. -Pass it. -Give it to me. -No. What if Towa finds it. Give it to me. You can't throw it away. I will keep it safe. This is Towa's precious history. Satsuki. You haven't changed your mind? I can't be separated from him. But children on this island will have to go to high school in the city. Like Yuichi, some don't return to the island. Back then I realised children don't belong to me. We only look after them. Wherever he is, whoever he is with, as long as he is well, that's enough. But this one came back to the island. This island does not refuse people who come, does not pursue people who leave, and does not refuse people who returns. Do you understand? I'll keep this. Welcome. Akane. Have a seat. Excuse me, can I have another plate please. Certainly. Sorry to call you out here so late. What is it you wanted? I went to Tokyo with Satsuki. We spoke to the probation officer Mr. Ito. He was worried about you because you left the factory suddenly. I don't know how to put this... Don't say anything. I don't want pity. It's not pity. All I want is to be Towa's mother again. Eat, laugh and sleep with him. That's all. But Towa thinks Satsuki is his mother. I know! Then... If a mother failed once, is she never allowed to hug her child again? I think Towa's happiness should come first. What do you think Towa is doing? Akane, wait a minute! Let me go! Are you trying to take his mother away again? Shut up, shut up, shut up! I am his mother. I gave birth to him. I am his mother! Why... Why only me have to lose everything? Why? Everyone has plenty. Good husband and family. Job, colleagues and home town! Give me another chance. One more chance. Akane. Marry me. Marry me and two of us... can watch Towa grow up together. Then no one will complain. Akane. That'll be good. Here, with me.. What happened? Anything wrong? I'm sorry! On behalf of my mum, I'm sorry. So please be friends again. Towa. You had a fight with mum, didn't you? Everyone says so. Mum must be feeling sorry about it, too, so... OK. -Do you feel good? -Yes. Me, too. Right, here we are. You can come to my house. No, here is fine. Why? Just because. Did you know? I heard yellowtails have many mothers. Do they? Yellowtails are brought up by everyone. Everyone who brings up a child is mother, apparently. I see. But the best mother may be the sea. My dad said that. So it's not just my mother but granny, dad, Hideyuki, everyone is my mother, I was told. Dad and Hideyuki are men. But they all bring me up. So everyone on this island is my mother. You, too, Akane! -Me, too? -Yes. Well then, bye. Cradle my baby down to sleep Sings a canary sweet and high Sweet baby sleep baby Good-night lullaby We'll have 1,500 tomorrow. Can't we have more? -Sure, leave it with me. -Thank you Satsuki. Come with me for a bit. Let me borrow your boat. -Are you going to check on things? -Yes. Come on. About Towa. Me, Yuichi and granny. We can't imagine life without Towa. We are a family. We will cherish him more than ever before. So... please let him stay with us. I have been preparing all this time to be with him again one day. I had training, qualification, found a job. I was restarting my life. I know. The internet café, the factory and the building you were going to jump from. I visited them all. How hard it must have been for you. I understand it in my own way. It's agony to be separated from your own fresh and blood. You wouldn't understand. I have a scar here. He was wiggling inside. And he grew. You will get used to the pain of being hit by a man. But this scar is different. It still hurts after seven years. He was here. I don't understand it. Of course I don't. It's full of things I don't understand. Everyday I do my best to become Towa's mother. Telling him off, praising him. I don't know if I'm doing it right. But I love him. I love Towa. Satsuki. He came to see me the other day. Do you know what he said? He asked me to make it up with you. Such a good boy. He loves his mum so much. Your family has become his family. I'm truly grateful. Towa grew up on this island. It's not just me. He has been brought up by everyone on the island. This was his favourite toy. One day I will tell him about you. If one day Towa leaves the island then... You should keep this. Thank you for giving birth to him. Beautiful. Please. Thank you. -Is this it? -Yes. They are dancing. Sorry I got you to help me. Not at all! Aren't you going to the festival? I want to get to Osaka early. I want to show my face to the new workplace, too. But... I promised Satsuki. If one day Towa leaves this island then I will take him in with open arms. I see. I'm heading off. -Thank you. -Pleasure. Thank you so much. Thank you. Mr. Niimi, would you take this bike? Me? Really? I will keep it until you come to the island next time. The island isn't going anywhere. It will be always waiting for you. Thank you. Well then. Akane! Have a good day. Thank you. Go on, Towa. Very good! Great performance! -Towa, come on! -Yes, come on! Towa looks great. That's good!
