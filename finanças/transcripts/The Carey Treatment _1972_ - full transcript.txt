[dramatic music] [music continues] [music on stereo] Hey. - Turn that thing down, huh? - What? - Turn the radio down. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. This is doctor's parking, you can't park here. Say. This is doctor's. Doctor's... [ambulance siren wailing] Just one minute. Do you understand English? Yeah. - Doctor's parking, right? - Yes. Move it. Give me five minutes, friend I'll lay open from chest to crotch, re-section your colon alter your sex, and sew you up with the laces out of my shoes. Well, why didn't you say so? Will you keep your eyes on my goods? Woman on PA: Dr. Southmore, wanted in surgery. Dr. Southmore, wanted in surgery. Nurse Veemer, please report to nurse's station 2nd floor. Nurse Veemer, please report to nurse's station 2nd floor. Dr. Carey? - Dr. Carey? - Yeah. Andrew Murphy. Murph to my friends. Well, how are you, Murph? I am currently chief resident here which as I needn't tell you indicates a very low man on the pole. - Well, not the lowest. - True. You're late. We expected you yesterday. Ah, well, hell. Anticipation's half the fun, right, Murph? Come on, I'll show you around the factory. Woman on PA: Dr. Pasconi, please report to Dr. Randall's office. I'd really like to get something to eat. Some eggs, some coffee, uh... Dr. Carey, compared to our coffee a half a CC of epinephrine's like a weak milkshake. [laughing] What about the egg? Gigantic. Not a hen in the premises without chronic hemorrhoids. [snaps fingers] - Where do we go? - Right over here. [indistinct chatter] Here. Oh, Dr. Carey. You know, I was expecting you yesterday. Oh, well I got a little hung up. - And, you know Jonathan. - Sure I do. Welcome, glad to see you again, Pete. - Dr. Tao there. - Yes, we interned together. - David, how are you? - How's things in California? - Everything's great. - Dr. Jenkins. - Dr. Jenkins. - How'd you do? Dr. Carey, Georgia Hightower. - Georgia. - Hello. - Dr. Weston. - Dr. Barr. Dr. Barr. Well, California. How come you don't have more of a tan? Well, I'm from Northern California, it's a long state. What brings you to Boston? More bread. Something smells good. What's that, you? No, oh, no, it's, um, vanilla. I spilled some down my front trying to improve the A custard. Well, you work in a kitchen, huh? - Yeah, I'm the dietician. - Oh. If you have any complaints there's a complaint box over there. And if you have any compliments please pay them personally. Pete, uh, Penny would want to see you. How about dinner tonight? Sure, why not? - Hey, Georgia. - What? How would you like to join us for dinner tonight? Yeah, make it a foursome. Okay. Pick me up after 7:00. - Okay. - I have to feed my son. Why can't your husband feed him? Oh, he's in Aspen, skiing. When is he due back? He's not. Bye. Yeah, come on. Nice to have you around again. Thanks, David. [instrumental music] Hey, tell me about the complex. Starting with... - Old J.D. - J.D.? And work up to Georgia. Well, J.D. is celestial. Plays bridge. Has a new, young, expensive wife. Hm, well, I can tell where you spent your childhood. With J.D., if you're under 60 and white, you call him "Sir." If you're black, yellow or somewhere in between you evaporate. That's awkward, isn't it? Prudent. Prudent. You wouldn't know. Oh, being white, protestant, et cetera, et cetera? Blaine, you've met. He runs the place, checks the laundry counts the bedpans. Nothing's the matter with him that a retirement and a healthy bowel movement won't cure. [chuckles] And, then, there's Jenkins. He puts his finger in payphones to see if anybody's left a dime. It's occupational. He's a proctologist. Oh, man. Ah, let me see now, there's... Sanderson, you've met him already. Yeah. What about Murphy? Murphy, Murphy. He'll marry for money and never regret it. His bride might. [instrumental music] Woman on PA: Dr. Barr, report to 2nd floor nurse's station. Dr. Barr, report to 2nd floor, nurse's station. Hey, what happened? Did they lose something? You bet, a gross of morphine ampoules. It's happened before. I think it's an inside job. Check all their luggage. There you go. What do you get? Stop, or I'll shoot! - Hey! - Ah! Come on, hey. What in the hell do you think you're doing, huh? Come on. That doctor's tag doesn't give you any right to interfere with an officer in pursuit of a felon. Listen, that badge doesn't give you the right to shoot a 20-year-old nitwit who ought to know he can't outrun 20 cops for Christ's sake, why'd you run? Listen, I smoke a little grass sometimes but I don't know anything about that morphine. Ah, so you carried it around in your pocket and come to the hospital, huh? - You deserve each other. - Hold it. You get searched. Come on. - Hi, there, Mrs. Duren. - Hello, doctor. - Alright. - Okay? Hey, doc. Wait a minute. Don't leave me with these guys. You've just been busted, man. [siren wailing] Hi, how about driving? Sure. I thought we were going apartment hunting. We are. Well, let's go. What's going on? Nothing. Oh, well, uh... An orderly got himself busted for carrying grass around in his pocket. Almost got himself shot. What's that got to do with you? Not a thing. Did you forget your wall? You know that thing that you carry around to keep everybody out? [laughs] [engine starts] Uh, there's an apartment... He almost took a place like this once. Whatever happened to him? You know, one morning I took him his frozen orange juice and he looked at it, and he said. "This is synthetic, you're synthetic and my whole goddamn life is synthetic with a dumb cluck kid." So, he put on a stocking cap packed his bag, went to Aspen. I haven't seen him since. And how did you deal with it? Carved the turkey explained masturbation to my son. Everything, anything, whatever. [instrumental music] Hey, I'm gonna take this place. - Are you? - Yeah. All it needs is some paint... Uh, a bear rug. - Oh, right. - Some soft music. - You'll be all set. - Yeah. Think I'll give you a key. Okay. But I'll warn you, I'll probably want to... pick out your curtains and I'll... end up bringing my waffle iron over. [music continues] Why are you looking at me like that? Cut it out. Stop it, stop it, stop it. It was the first year of medical school I was, uh, determined. I was going to be the greatest surgeon in the world. Really? What changed your mind? [sighs] Well, listen... Sometime, when you've got a couple of hours and you'd like to be really thoroughly depressed. Depressed? Yeah. - I might tell you. - Let me guess. A woman? - Nope. - No? Hell, no. Women have made my life bearable. Just bearable? - Almost. - Oh... [music continues] How come you never got married? Nobody gets married anymore. It's a dying institution. A thing of the past. Good riddance. Not that it was all his fault. I mean, I was lousy to his mother... - I was rotten with money. - Mm-hm. And the things I like to do in bed... he thought were immoral. They are. - Are they? - Yeah. Certainly are. [chuckles] Woman on PA: Wanted in X-Ray lab, 3rd floor. Karen? Oh, Dr. Sanderson, sorry, didn't see you. - How are you? - Just fine, thanks. - This is Dr. Carey. - How'd you do? How do you do? Would you excuse me? I've really gotta go. - Peter: Sure. - Nice meeting you. - Goodbye, Dr. Sanderson. - Goodbye, Karen. J.D.'s daughter. Oh, lord of all this was his father before him? Legend in his own time. No wonder the poor kid's hypertense. Dr. Randall's a brilliant surgeon and administrator, Peter. A rare combination. If it weren't for him and his family, this complex which you're privileged to join would be much less. - Much less. - Well, I'm sure of it. J.D.: Are you sleeping up there or taking a coffee break or what? I've got a patient on the table here with the hole cut in him. Where's the plasma report? - J.D.: Who am I talking to? - Dr. Peter Carey. J.D.: Well, look alive, Dr. Peter Carey. What's taking so long? - You want it right? - J.D.: I'll want it now. Specimen appears composed of undifferentiated perinkable cells which have invaded the normal surrounding tissue. The cells show many irregular hyperchromatic nuclei. Large numbers of mitosis and some multi-nucleared cells. My impression is... primary malignancy of the lung probably bronchogenic carcinoma. J.D.: Thank you, doctor. You're welcome. If you intend to stay with us I wouldn't start by antagonizing the boss. Well, listen, before I kiss his ass I think I'll go have a look at it. Woman on PA: Call for Dr. Murphy in the emergency. Call for Dr. Murphy in the emergency. - How you doing, Pete. - Hey, David. Jeez. He's fast, isn't he? Yeah. He's got a golf game at 11:00. What's his kill rate? Pretty high. Takes the toughest cases. Yeah, I guess old Randall's gonna make his golf game alright. - Oh, good morning. - Dr. Tao. Uh, Dr. Carey, Dr. Randall. - Oh, Dr. Carey. - Dr. Randall. You're the one I had words with this morning? - I'm afraid I was rude. - Oh. I'm sure you're very skilled at your job or you wouldn't be here. Well, it's costing you $45,000 a year. Let's hope so. [dramatic music] [horn hoking] [dramatic music] [music continues] [telephone ringing] I'll get it. Uh, yeah? What? Hey, it's 4 o'clock in the morning, man. Where? Oh, yeah. Oh, uh, yeah, yeah. I thought pathologist didn't make house calls. David Tao's in jail. [telephone ringing] See, I'd like to see a Dr. David Tao, please. See the sergeant. Peter: Sergeant? - Yeah, what is is? - I'd like to see Dr. David Tao. - You can't. - Why not? He's on ice. Well, in that case let me have your badge number. Beat it. Listen, officer. Let me explain the law to you. You're required to give your badge number to anyone who requests it. If you... Alright, alright. Are you his lawyer? Yeah. - What's your name? - Carey. Can't blame to be careful, you know? Murder is murder. Alright. Listen, I had to tell the guy I was your lawyer otherwise I couldn't get in. What's happened? I'm in hell of a mess. I've been booked for murder. Well... who the hell you supposed to have killed? Karen Randall. She was brought into emergency last night by her mother. Bleeding profusely... exsanguinating in a state of hemorrhagic shock. A few minutes later, she died. The police think I aborted her. - Why you? - Oh, I don't know, I don't. Uh, maybe she was delirious and mentioned my name. Uh, I do abortions, Pete. [sighs] Why? Why? It all started when this dumb little. Puerto Rican girl came to me. She had been knocked up by some smart ass kid whose mother own, owns half of Delaware. Stud wouldn't admit it. Who could prove otherwise? She was gonna go to some... some character she heard of would do it for 75 bucks and throw in a voodoo prayer to match. Oh, I couldn't sleep that night. I kept thinking about those, those amateur abortions I'd seen as an intern when... when the girls came in bleeding and foaming... I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, Peter. Yeah. Well, I... I decided the law wasn't fair. You know... a doctor plays God in... in a lot of crappy ways. I... I thought this was a good way. [sighs] - What'd you charge, David? - 25 bucks. To cover lab fees. No more, no less. Sanderson's been covering up for me. He puts in phony slides for the tissue committee, and writes them up as DNC's. [chuckles] Now, that he's retiring, I was working up to asking you for the same help. Yeah, well, I'm for the four day week, the volunteer army, and married priests. But when it comes to breaking a law, I try using a little discretion that's hard as hell to play God doing five to life, man. Listen, Pete, I... I never touched Karen Randall. She was four months pregnant. Four months. I told her to have her kid and... and maybe it would turn out to be Mozart or Freud. Listen, David... you're a respected member of the professional community. Not some bum with two cents in his pocket. And if they're arrested you and they can't make it stick... well, they are gonna get chopped. Man: Captain wants to see you. I don't know what the hell I can do, David, but... Pete, Peter. Tell Penny, I... [mumbles] Yeah. - Mr. Carey. - Yup. My name's Pearson. I know most of the lawyers in Boston. How come I don't know you? I'm not a lawyer. You told the Sergeant you were. That makes you a liar, Mr. Carey. I'm a doctor. Very often, the two are the same. Well, I have a bit of advice for you. Figured you might. Stay the hell away from Tao. The publicity could kill your practice. What publicity? The publicity from the trial. Well, who says there's gonna be a trial? I do. And the publicity could kill your practice. I don't have a practice, captain. I'm a pathologist. I work in hospitals. I do autopsies, I slice up livers, cut up stips... You like your work? Yeah, you like yours? I'd rather plant Tuberous Begonias. [laughs] Yeah, well, to each his own it's the American way. A young girl bled to death from an illegal abortion. Not a $10 Doxy. A 15 year old child from a good family! And she was pretty and she was sweet and she was butchered! You're hyperventilating. - Yeah, well, I'm mad, doctor... - Listen. Dr. Tao is a top surgeon. He can put together a Swiss watch wearing dark glasses and boxing gloves. Karen Randall was murdered by a sloppy abortion. You got the wrong man. Before she died... the girl told her mother Tao aborted her. Now the mother made a statement and she'll swear to it in front of a jury. - And that's all you need? - That's all. But if there's more we'll find it. Uh, who knows, you might even be involved. Oh, yeah, well, there's always that possibility. Does that mean you are? It means that, uh, that is a possibility. Why you take a tough line, doctor? Well, you can always bring out the rubber hose? Ah, no, we don't do it that way anymore. Oh, gee, I wish I could be more reassured about that. Uh, it's better you aren't. Oh, you mean that in my case you just might make an exception? Anything is possible. Goodnight, captain. Goodnight, Dr. Carey. Damn, his principles! He should've been thinking about his own family. He's not in jail for his principles, he's in jail for murder. Because he did a stupid thing like do abortions. You talked to Penny? Yeah, I talked to her. I talked and she cried. She's really a wreck. Look, I'm gonna go see Penny during lunch. Yeah, well, maybe you better take Murph along, so I can... give her a little sedation if she needs it. I thought you'd come. No, I've got a heavy morning. I want to see the report of the dead girl before the autopsy. - Should I keep dinner warm? - Yeah. Hell, keep everything warm. Okay? [mice squeaking] What's on your mind? Yeah, I'd like to see the charts on Karen Randall. She was admitted this morning or late last night sometime in and out. - Well, you can't have 'em. - Why not? The old man has it. Come on, spring them for me, will ya? I'd really like to see. No. What happened? He get to you? [scoffs] Don't take that attitude with me. Oh, come on... Barr. A daughter of J.D. Randall was killed by an abortion, now, someone has to pay. Tao's an abortionist. And Boston with a jury more than half Catholic, they'll convict him on general principles. So, are you Catholic? Oh, I'm not a believer of any kind. Not even in a fair shake, huh? - Least of all that. - Mm-hm. What's the biopsy for? Morphine. It's an old fashioned way of doing it. Well, I'm not a pathologist. The blood samples from a 16 year old freshman at Yale they says he's very bright. - Mm. - He's my son. Sanderson. Saw Tao this morning. Yeah. [Clears throat] Word gets around. You were helping him. I thought I believed in what he was doing. What about now? J.D. Randall has been my friend and colleague for 30 years. I knew his first wife. I've known his two children since they were born, I... I bounced Karen on my knee when she was baby. Yeah. Well, there's a couple of things I gotta check out. Can you cover for me? Two or three days. No more. I'm 68 years old and I'm a diabetic, I can't push myself. Oh, I promise I won't make a career out of it. Well, if you're going to sniff around, you ought be over at the post. They're due to start any minute. You're not doing it? No. I couldn't. And I'd rather you didn't. Okay. Thank you. Good morning, Carey. What brings you here? Post on Karen Randall. Mind if I sit in? Any special reason? Do I need one? No. We'll be starting in a minute. Do you wanna change? No, no, I'll just watch this one here. This is Mr. Newman, our diener. Mr. Newman. Dr. Carey. [dramatic music] Well, we better stay awake for this one. She's J.D.'s daughter, you know? - She's just a youngster. - 15. What do you make of it? Recent weight gain, striation marks on her hips and breasts. She's a blonde, she's got some dark hair here on her upper lip and... some more on her forearms. - New looking. - Yeah, that's interesting. Mm. Sixty four inches. [camera clicks] [bulb clatters] [camera clicks] [bulb clatters] [camera clicks] [bulb clatters] [eerie music] Suction. [machine whirring] Here it is. There's a slice through the endometrium and muscle, that's where she bled out. It doesn't look like the work of a total amateur, somebody knew the principles of curette. Yeah. Except for the perforation. Yeah... except for that. Well, we know one thing, she didn't do this to herself. She couldn't have done this kind of scraping on herself. Isn't that the uterus? It's normal. Are you here on a teaching capacity, Dr. Carey? Well, she wasn't pregnant. Nobody knows anything until the post is completed. I can't afford to pre diagnose. Come on, doctor, if you can't read this one you'll lose your license. Peter: Dr. Barker? Yes. Hi. You are Peter Carey, I know about you. What do you know about me? I'm told that you are very good natured, first thing in the morning. Now who could've told you anything like that? - Georgia. - Georgia? We have lunch, we're friends. What else did she tell you? That you make a great Souffle, and that you clean up afterwards. Yes, I'm totally house broken. [chuckles] Sit down. Have an apple. I've got... Cortland and Delicious today. I'll have a Delicious. I grow them. Really? Where? I have an orchard in Dover. Lovely old one. Why don't you come out for a long weekend and see? Uh, no, thanks, doctor. - Scruples? - Stamina. I wouldn't be so cheerful in the morning if I had to keep two going, you know... [chuckles] Well, if I can't tempt you, what else can I do for you? A hormone test, for pregnancy in autopsy. - How far long? - Four months. Somebody you knocked up, doctor? Nope, just a case. I need two CCs, there's plenty here, no problem. Ms. Holder? Angela? Set this up for a hormone. Thanks for the apple, doctor. [upbeat music] [indistinct chatter] [chatter continues] Oh! It's alright. Peter: Oh. Hello, doctor. Nice party. You know, I don't know why but it's... I get the impression you're not really having a very good time. Oh. I'm sorry. I am, you know, it's... It's just that I've always had a difficult time expressing my true emotions. Well, then that gives us... What, several alternatives we can do. Begin a real conversation. Or we can begin a phony one. Or we can just go our separate ways. Yeah. Well, I must say that that's not a... an alternative that I'd even consider. I'm surprised, doctor. You look like a man that considers just about every alternative. Well, listen, we have three now, why don't you pick one? Let's try going our separate ways. Well, wait, wait. What happens if we regret it later? Well then, I know where to find you and you know where to find me. That's for giving such nice parties, doctor. [indistinct chatter] Thank you. You know, there are two things in this world that I really hate. Yeah? What's that? One's... cold chili and the other one is Angela Holder. Not necessarily in that order. Oh, listen, come on, now don't be too hard on her. I'm sure she has... some redeeming features. Yeah? Name one. Well, I can think of a couple. I think I'm going home. [chuckles] Come on. What's wrong? I just don't wanna say or do anything that I'll be sorry for in the morning. Oh, really? Well, give me a "For instance.” For instance, I might say... that Angela's a type of broad... that if a man, any man rubbed two quarters together... Listen, would it make any difference to you if I told you that we just had an awkward conversation out there. Yeah. Is that all it was? No. Pete, would you... please give me one good reason why I should calm down? Listen, you have no reason in the world to get yourself all worked up. You just stay who you are, baby. I'll stay who I am. Right? Right. Two points for the bachelor. Oh, come on. [moaning] You sure know how to hurt a girl. Mm. Well, you do. I'm mad at you. - I just remembered. - What? Why? [chuckle] 'Cause... [clears throat] Okay... Murph? Think you better drive him home, yeah? Oh, I'll drive. Hello, Murph. How you doing, Murph? Mother will take you home now. You've been checked out on an... Oh, Murph. Hey, goodnight, baby. [rattling] Hey, hey! [glass shatters] Now, why the hell did you come after me like that? Say, what the hell is it with you, man? Have you been watching too many movies or you got something personal against me? - I'm her brother. - Who's brother? Karen's. I think I broke my nose. I hope so. He killed her and you're not gonna help him get out of it. I just wanted to stop you any way I could. There you go, stick this on your nose. Put your head back. She was 15 years old, you know that? Yeah, I know that. Hadn't heard from her for a while and I... I got this birthday card this morning. She's dead and here comes this birthday card in the mail. It says, "I'm glad you were born. Because I need $20 till next Thursday.” Here you go, man, drink this. Thanks. Say listen, how'd you lose touch with her? My father sent her to a girls' school. Ms. Carter's for snotty young ladies. Did she have a boyfriend? Boyfriend? I doubt it. Her roommate Lydia had to have all the boys, including Karen's. Listen, she went to bed with somebody. Well, that'd be her business. Who was her family doctor? My uncle Joshua. We're all doctors of varying degrees of skill in my family, you know. You go to Harvard? Yeah. Where'd you do your obstetrical? At the BLI. You assisted any D-and-C's there? Yeah, several. You know how. You son of a bitch! Are you saying I did this one? You could have. She was in trouble. She was my sister. I would've done it for mine. Well, I didn't do it for mine. Dr. Carey? Oh, Dr. Carey. Dr. Randall. I've been waiting to have a talk with you. Well, I haven't wanted to intrude. Ah, my condolences. Your daughter's death was shocking and unnecessary. I try to know my staff personally. As well as professionally. Sir? You've come to us with an excellent reputation, doctor. But there's one thing that... puzzles me. You're rarely at work. I've been conducting a little investigation. Of what nature? I'm trying to find out why a profession so dedicated to the objective examination of fact is out to crucify ah innocent man. Dr. Tao is an abortionist. Operating illegally. As a doctor his ethics are questionable. As a citizen of this state his actions are, are punishable and your helping him. You're disregarding your work. Is it my work you're concerned with, doctor, or is it the investigation? There are men like you in every profession, Carey. Dissident professors, disloyal military officers, renegade priests. Why do any of you stay? Why don't you leave our institutions to those who feel it's an honor to serve them? Why don't we fumigate the institutions? ...cracking down on the doctor that jerks a woman's ovaries because he needs a, a new wet bar in his $150,000 ranch house. What about getting rid of the quack that charges a $1000 to an old man to lift off a cataract that takes him exactly four minutes between coffee breaks? The four man consultation for a pimple on somebody's nose, the kick backs on referrals. Listen, doctor, we gotta break a few windows, let a little fresh air in. That's vandalism, doctor. No, that's integrity. William: Mrs. Randall? Dr. Carey. - Hello, Dr. Carey. - Mrs. Randall... My husband told me that you'd be showing up. - Did he? - Mm-hmm. He also told me to boot your tail out of here. You always do what your husband tells you? No. What would you like to drink? - Tea, I think. - Oh. William, would you please bring some tea, and another scotch. Oh, please, sit down, doctor. Why the long look? Is my slip showing? Well, you're not wearing one. What can I do for you? - Tell me about your daughter. - My step daughter. I'm not old enough to have been her mother. Oh, really? Yeah, really. Oh, well, if you say so. Alright, doctor, get to the point. I wanna know why you lied to the police about Dr. Tao. Careful. I'm Shanty Irish and liar is a fighting word. He's too good a doctor, he couldn't possibly have carved anyone up like that. Karen told me three times before she died that Dr. Tao was responsible. She was awake and you talked to her? She passed out just as we got to the hospital. Well, how do you know it was an abortion? It could've been a miscarriage. I looked in her purse. And clipped to her check book was Dr. Tao's card and the last check she made out was to cash for $300. That's how I know it was an abortion. Was that check ever cashed? The man who has it is in jail, he hasn't had time to make it to the bank. Well, Dr. Tao's fee for an abortion was $25. Just to cover lab costs. It was his way of keeping himself honest, Mrs. Randall. What's yours? I don't swipe lipsticks from the five and dime anymore. I sit in a family pew. I belong to the flower society. And I, I very seldom say shit in company. Well, let's hear it for Mrs. Randall. I'm a member of the club with all dues paid. Can't lay a glove on you? I don't think so. I'm gonna try. Be my guest. Sure you won't change your mind and join me in a drink? Oh, no, no, no, I'm afraid you're too young for me, honey. Mm. What? Well, you can rule out adrenal tumor. Rule out... an ovarian tumor. The endometrium is not hyper plastic, if anything, it's dormant. Atrophic. And the thyroid the adrenals are going... Seem to show a panhypopituitarism. Would you mind putting that in English, please? [sighs] Well, even in Swahili it would mean, I don't know. I need some corroborating evidence. Brain pathology, blood hormones, X-rays. That reminds me. Your friend Dr. Barker hasn't brought those blood tests back yet. - Why not? - I don't know. What would it prove? That she wasn't pregnant. But she thought she was pregnant. Yeah, she missed a period. I missed a period once when I had to play. Lady McBeth in high school. - Lady McBeth? - Mm. Yeah, well, tension can suppress menstruation once, but not for three months. And not with the other signs, the obesity, the new distribution of hair. Listen, if I were you I'd stop looking at that those files and find the guy she was sleeping with. Oh, really? You don't think that science can provide the answer, huh? Not as fast as sex. Well, now I'm sleeping with you, now what could anyone deduce from that? Not much. Aww. Maybe that I was available and you were handy. You mean, that's as far as we've got, huh? To date. Well, would it console you to know that my... feelings go much deeper than that. Sure. And given the time and the opportunity I'll fend off your creditors, spoil your child, give you love and admiration day and night. Mm. - When do we start? - First thing in the morning. I'm gonna be at this all night long. Why don't you take a cab and go home. [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] [chuckles] That's it. Hey, man, wake up. Mm. What time is it? :00. You're a sloppy bastard. Don't you cover up your microscope when you're through and put your slides away? And when are you gonna go to work at this hospital? The chief of service has been putting the squeeze on me. Tell him I've got Tertiary syphilis. Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised if you did. Peter: Ms. Barrett? Yes? Hello I'm Dr. Carey. I'm Karen Randall's uncle. Oh, have you come for her things? Well, actually I came to talk to you. Oh, well, I'm terribly sorry, I can't. I've got an appointment with my orthodontist. Well, we'll talk fast. But you see we're not allowed to have men in our rooms. It's against the rules. Well, we'll bend a little rule then, shall we? She threw darts at him every night before she went to sleep. Are you sorry she's dead, Lydia? I'm sorry when anybody dies. Didn't you like her, Lydia? I didn't pick her. They assigned us to the same room, but I'm not going to have a roommate anymore. Well, don't you get along with people? Not if they're crude. Karen was crude? Well, yeah, she was always trying to shock me. Oh. Well, maybe you shock easily. She'd take her cloths off and parade in front of the windows. She talked like a truck driver. So does my mother on occasion. Lydia: She was promiscuous. All she talked about was what men did in bed to her and what she did to them. She said she's take two at a time or three or four. She didn't care. Are you a virgin? I don't have to answer that. No, you don't. You're not my father or my minister or my family doctor. No, I'm not. I just... I just thought that it'd be such a rarity these days, you might be proud of it. Well, for your information, I am. Oh, well, if you had a little charity with that chastity you'd qualify as a nice girl. I've got to go. Yes, I'm sorry, I've made you late. I'll drop you anywhere you like. Well, what is it now? [engine revving] Those are mine! What are they, Lydia? They're for my headaches. Give them to me. I'm no pharmacologist, Lydia. It's my guess they're birth control pills. And that you're on 'em. And that makes you a liar, doesn't it? Go to hell. And everything that you told me about Karen is probably true about you. Stop this car and let me out. [engine revving] [tires screech] Please, stop. Stop. [tires screech] L... let me out, please. Jesus! Ah, what... what are you doing? She went into shock, Lydia. She couldn't control her bladder or her bowels. - Oh! - She couldn't breathe. [screaming] Two quarts of blood spilled out of her, she bled to death. [tires screech] I'm gonna find out who Killed her and you're gonna help me, Lydia. [engine revving] [bell tolling] [screaming] [instrumental music] [screaming] [tires screech] [screaming] [screaming] [sobbing] Why did you lie? She stole my boyfriend! He was crazy about me until she came along. - What's his name? - Roger! - Peter: Roger what? - Roger Hudson! - Where does he live? - I don't know. Well, what does he do? - Oh, he's a life guard... - You have a picture of him? No! [crying] Oh, goddamn. Peter: Is that him? You son of a bitch. Yeah. - What? - Dr. Barker has a flu. Ah, she called me last night from the Dover and asked me to give you the results to the blood test. And what does it say? Ah, "The hormone, metabolite excretion levels are flat low." There's no pregnancy. Thank you very much, I'll do the same for you one day. Fred. Hey, would you mind? Karen Randall wasn't pregnant. Wasn't pregnant? What do you mean? She told me she was. She... she told me she had missed four periods. Did you examine her? No, no, I didn't want anything to do with her. I, I booted her out. I sent her to her family physician. Her uncle. Yeah, her uncle. Go see him, Pete. He... he does the same thing I do, except for bigger money and a better... Joshua Randall does abortion? Yes. Yes, he does. [whistles] Well, hey, listen, did... did she say anything about a guy named Roger? - Roger? - Yeah. - Nope. - Nothing. Nothing like, you know, who the guy might be? No, no, she... she never said anything. Mm. Joshua Randall, huh? I think I'll just go see him. - Take care. - Thanks, Pete. Hey. [whistles] [horn honking] [tire screeches] [doorbell rings] - Who is it? - Dr. Peter Carey. Joshua: Come on up, Dr. Carey. [buzzing] [knock on door] Hello, Dr. Carey. I'm back here in the kitchen. Turn left and left again. I'm sorry I couldn't greet you at the door properly, but if I were to leave this sauce now, it probably would curdle. It's a difficult thing to get it precisely right. You like Danish rum sauce, doctor? Only if it's precisely right. Precisely. Precisely. Come on in, have a seat. What part of the West Coast are you from, doctor? - I'm from Palo Alto. - Joshua: Oh, that's nice. And who are your people? And what do they do? Well, my father teaches history. My mother is a biochemist. My brother has acne. My sister plays the flute. [chuckles] You'll forgive me if my probe, doctor. It's an old surgical habit. No, go ahead. Let's probe. Well, do you gamble? Do you womanize? Do you play chess? Perhaps, are you a Sunday painter? No, I'm a pathologist. I'm just trying to get your measure, doctor. Six-one and a half. You know, my brother's afraid of you. Hand me that knife over there, will you, please? He's afraid you'll throw open our closet doors and our shortcomings and our failures and our idiot children will come tumbling out of the closet. - Will they? - Perhaps. Stir this for a moment, will you? You know, Karen came to my office about a week ago. She said she was pregnant and she wanted an abortion. I told her I would have to run some tests first. She was to come to my office on Thursday. What did the test show? [chuckles] Well, I don't know. She didn't come to my office. Wouldn't that strike you as curious? Well, you know, young girls, sometimes they get hysterical when they miss their periods. Well, if the test had proven positive, you would perform the abortion. Are you accusing me of being an abortionist, doctor? I'm not accusing you of anything, doctor. I'm just stating the fact that I think I could get half the highborn ladies of this town to attest to. Sometimes doctors perform abortions out of the conviction that a woman should have domain over her own body. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Peter: Well, I have a theory about your niece. I don't think she was pregnant. Don't you? No, I think she had a pituitary tumor. Slow growing, relatively benign but enough to convince a youngster that she was pregnant. Her period stopped. She gained weight. She panicked. What are you saying, that her death was unnecessary? Yeah, the only one who listened. I think she got herself an abortion and... it wasn't necessary, and it killed her. How does that make you feel, doctor? Don't you give a damn either? [exhales] Would you stop that Julia Child bit? You're asking me to believe that your 15 year old niece came to you and told you she was pregnant. And you told her to come back Thursday for tests and when she didn't show up... you chalk it up to hysteria? You didn't call her father, your own brother. You don't do anything. You just sit on your big fat ass. I'm not asking you to believe anything. I didn't ask you to come to my home, and I didn't ask you to insult me with your accusations. But I do ask you to leave my home before I call the police. I... Listen... Look, a 15 year old girl is dead, doctor. A talented man is gonna spend 20 years of his life in jail for something he didn't do. But there's nothing I can tell you that will help him. Nothing. Listen, I'm, uh... Yeah, okay. [horn honks] - Captain Pearson. - Dr. Carey. We've got a complaint about you. Only one? Dr. Randall said you're harassing members of his family, his son, his wife, his daughter's school friend. Have I broken a law? It hasn't been determined yet. But until it is, I think I'll just... I can take you in for questioning, you know. Yeah, you could really be sticking your neck out if you did. No, no, no, ho, no, no. You've been trespassing on private property. The Randall home. I lost my way. I had to stop by and ask for direction. Dr. Carey, I can make things so tiresome for you in this town. Captain, if you so much as lay one unwarranted ticket on me, in fact, if I see you again outside the policeman's ball, I'm going to slap you with a complaint of harassment and send it to the district's attorney's office, the office of mayor and the chief of police. All this is gonna catch up with you, you know. Yeah, when if it does, you're gonna be the first I call. I appreciate that. [tires screeching] You really do that well, captain. [instrumental music] I'm stuffed. That was terrific. - You like the fish? - Mm-hmm. [grunts] Well, listen, the only real fish is a salmon that comes out of the Klamath River on a summer afternoon. My father cooks it. All of those old black skillets with... ashes from his pipe falling in it. [sighs] We'd lie back at the great old tree by the river... and eat it. And talk. French Revolution... and women. What is he like? Oh. Well, he... believes in the efficacy of cold baths. Grieves for the American Indian. He's an excellent carpenter. [laughs] And he still takes my mother upstairs on a Sunday afternoon and... locks the door. [laughs] Says grace before soup. You must have had a nice childhood. Yeah. Except for bed wetting problems. There's, uh... - Hi. - Hi. [instrumental music] [knock on window] [intense music] Hey! Hey! [music continues] [panting] [music continues] Don't hit me. Please. Don't hit me. Why not, you son of a bitch? I just had a hernia operation. Please. [train chugging] Finlay: Get a couple of bucks and the person you knew... Woman: I spend 16 hours a day in this crummy joint I deserve some kind of recreation. Finlay: Recreation? Why don't you go to the beach? Woman: It's too cold for the beach. Finlay. Hey, listen, there's one picture on here. I'd like it blown up pretty big. How big? Well, you know, three or four feet, something like that. What kind of a picture is it? Well, listen, I think you'll love it. We don't do funny pictures here. - Can I have it tomorrow? - Leave it. See, you took a, a picture of my nephew a while back. I'm trying to locate him. I wonder if you still might have his address. You don't know where your own nephew lives. Well, you know, kids move around a lot these days. He doesn't look like you. Well, who says he's gotta look like me? Well, I'll see what I can do. Okay, and you'll have that tomorrow, huh? Right? He in? Dr. Carey, just a minute, please. Ah, here we go, Dr. Randall. Two consenting adults making love. Not the most dignified position in the world, perhaps, but certainly one of the most joyous. If I'd know you were going to send a photographer, I'd have had my, my haircut. Do you really think that... I'd stooped to blackmail? Somebody did. Anyway, you can have it. Yeah, I think it kinda brightens up your office. [horn honks] Hey, your enlargements were a big hit. Looks like the exercise was agreeing with you. Yeah, not a flattering angle though. Well, it's them harsh lights. [laughs] Yeah. Hey, about my nephew. - Got nothing on him. - Oh, come on. He come in here to pose, like the prince himself. Sometimes I have the address, but nothing on him. Just the name, Roger Hudson. - No date? - A year ago at most. Say, what do you got on him anyway? - You know him? - You're not a cop. Or you would have said so and proved it. So what do you got on him? Well, he got a girl in trouble. She... she must be some dumb broad. Yeah, maybe, but she didn't deserve to die. The punk gives rub-downs at Callahan steam baths about a block down. I seen him there last Friday night. Thank you, brother. I understand there's a, a guy named Roger Hudson. - He's good with the hands. - Yeah, he's good. But he's busy right now and will be till about 6:30, an hour. Oh, yeah, well, listen I will take some steam or something. Fine. A Buck for the steam. Six bucks for the rub. You're in pretty good shape... sir. What's your name? Carey. What's yours? Come on, man. You know my name. Callahan said you asked for me special. You're a cop, aren't you? What makes you think I'm a cop? I can usually spot 'em. That's why. Got one looking for you? I sure hope not. You work here all day, Roger? Roger: Eight hours. - Yeah. Then what do you do? - Work out in the gym. Ride my bike. Shoot some pool, ball my chick. Watch the sun come up. Anything I wanna do, I do. - So when you sleep? - I don't. I just keep right on going. What on? Wheat germ. Well, I could buy some of that. Any health food store, babe. I'd like to buy some of yours. Yeah, man, but I told you I'm not in that kind of business. Yeah? That's not what Angela Holder tells me. [intense music] [grunts] Holder, huh? Yeah, she's a... she's a nurse at the... at the Boston memorial. [grunts] - Jesus Christ! - Sorry, sir. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Callahan warns me that sometimes I don't even know my own strength. Strange about that Holder chick, though. Can't really place her. But then I can't be expected to remember them all, can I? Tell me... did you keep track of... Karen Randall? Oh, why don't you relax? And quit talking. - Randall? - Yeah. I never heard of the chick. It's funny. I heard you knocked her up. - That I what? - Knocked her up? [laughs] No way. Of course, it wouldn't be the first time that some chick tried to pin something like that on me, you know. Yeah. Well, this chick was 15 years old. With baby fat still hanging on her. [intense music] Some sadistic son of a bitch carved her up bad. [chuckles] That's too bad. Yeah. Roll over. Where are you going? I'm not finished with you. Oh, yes, you are. [groans] [clanking] [train chugging] [sighs] [intense music] Captain Pearson, please. Yeah, this is Dr. Carey. [engine revving] I... I think I know who killed Karen Randall. [glass shatters] Hello? [groaning] [siren wailing] Woman on PA system: Dr. Holliston, please report to the scrub room. Man: Let's get him onto the table. Get his clothes off and let's get those vital signs. Get some gauze and stop that bleeding. Get a crit and cross-match him. Let's stop the bleeding, then take X-rays. Now, don't talk. Your jaw maybe broken. I'm just gonna close this wound on your forehead and then we'll see. Better give him a tetanus-toxide too. And a shot of penicillin. Now blink your eyes. Once for yes, twice for no. Are you allergic to penicillin? You sure? [intense music] Hello, baby. [intense music] [glass shatters] You may have a few loose teeth, but no skull fracture anyway. What's my crit. What? My hematocrit, what is it? Well, 40, sir. Are you a doctor, sir? I'm Peter Carey. I'm a pathologist here. - Who's the resident on duty? - Dr. Murphy, sir. - Get him down here. - Go get Dr. Murphy. - How many stitches? - 12, sir. Will you stop calling me sir. Do another crit on me. I wanna find out if I'm bleeding inside. You're not wearing your name tag. - Ah, no, I'm not, sir. - Yeah, well wear it. Patients like to know who the hell they're talking too. - What happened to you? - Hey, Murphy. Say, I gotta see Angela Holder. Well, she's here in emergency. About an hour ago someone broke into the lab and stabbed her. Police are with her now. Captain Pearson has been looking for you. Yeah. Easy, buddy. You could have a hematoma. Now, listen, Murphy... My skull X-ray's are okay, are they? Yeah, well, you're under observation for 24 hours all the same. We haven't even begun to evaluate you for internal hemorrhage. Peter: Give me some whites, will you? - I gotta see Angela. - No way. I got to see her. Get me outta here. - Come on. - Alright. If anything goes wrong, it's your neck. Get him some whites. [intense music] [music continues] Alright, now, listen, Murph. When we get inside I'm gonna ask for ten milligrams of nailine and some morphine. - You give me saline. - Saline? What in the hell for? Just give it to me. [intense music] Hello, Angela. Your boyfriend's been busy tonight, huh? - How do you feel? - What difference does it make? Does it hurt? Huh? Does it hurt? I hope it does. I hope it hurts like hell. I'd like to see you wheeled out of here... with all the other garbage that this hospital produces. Dr. Murphy, will you give me that ten milligrams of nailine. Because this girl is an addict. Ten milligrams will throw her in a cold Turkey. Yeah, I'm gonna throw her right there. But that could kill her. Damn doctors. Doctors and cops damn. - How much you gonna give me? - All of it. Morphine, Angela. It gets you off. If I feel charitable. I'm not afraid of you. I've had it all. I've woken up in the street. I've woken up on my own vomit. I'll call you if I need you. I think I'll stick around, doctor. Okay. You're in trouble, Angela. It won't kill me. Peter: It might. I'm gonna let it. And you'll be in trouble too. Peter: No, no. In this room I'm God. I can label it anything I want. Heart failure, respiratory arrest, shock. I make out the death certificate. I wanna be cremated, huh? I can arrange that too. Now, you tell me about Karen. I don't know any Karen. Sure you do, you dream about her every night. I dream about crabs and spiders and my room burning up. It's Karen we're talking about. Karen, you tell me about her. I know, uh, Mary and Elizabeth and Emory. Who... who... who's Karen? You're convulsing, Angela. [sobbing] You'll wanna tell me about her in a minute, and you won't be able to. You know who did it. I wanna go home. Please. Who killed her? She called me Angel. Peter: Who killed her? - Who killed her? - I did! I did. I did. [sobbing] I didn't mean to. I don't know what happened. I knew how to do it. I don't know what happened. Why? They were checking. They were searching. They looked everywhere. They made me take my hair down. You were stealing drugs from the surgery. He said they didn't need it. That they were dying. It was too good for them. Peter: Roger? All summer long his hair... kept getting blonder and blonder like a halo. Oh, God, we slept on the beach and the grass. He couldn't steal anymore because they were checking. Yes. [sobbing] Yes! Ro... Roger had some, but he, he wanted money for it. I tried to sell my mother's ring, the man said it was just blue glass. I needed $300. Oh, God, I did the abortion. I did it. Who was the anesthetist? Roger, with neopentyl. Oh, God, it hurts. Please. - Come on. Come on. Come on. - Please, please, God. Please. [groans] Jesus, doctor, you're a worse son-of-a-bitch than I am. - Did it work? - Yeah. You mean you actually got her into withdrawal on saline. In and out. Oh, I think I.. [grunts] Pete. Hey, somebody get a gurney. I think there's something busted in there. - Crit's low. - His abdomen is rigid. We're gonna take him to the OR, put an IV in him, type and cross him, I'm gonna go scrub. [indistinct] [groans] Easy. [intense music] [music continues] Wait a minute, you're not supposed to be... [gasps] [screams] [grunts] [intense music] [gunshot] Cold hands. Jesus. Dr. Murphy, you're quite a seamstress. You better believe it. What other little goodies did you take out? Just the spleen, I had a date, I didn't have time for anything else. Now listen, would you guys change the subject, please? Now a splenectomy is a pretty rugged operation. Now I'm letting you out of here but I want you to sit home and watch a lot of daytime television. [chuckles] Yes, doctor. - Hurt much? - Only when I laugh. Well, listen, I'm sorry I wasn't there to help you. In a way it was, uh, kind of interesting. My first splenectomy. Oh! First and last. - Yeah. - Randall had me in. He, uh, he made a very graceful apology. He said, "Pride makes for perversity.” That he had been a fool if not a scoundrel. And that I had been a fool too. He would accept my eleemosynary intent. Eleeo.. Roughly services performed for no loot. I looked it up. Of course. Now, what did you say to that? Yes, sir, that he wasn't to be concerned because I hadn't planned to resume practice here anyway. Mm. Well, I... I can't blame you for that, David. What a way to make a living, huh? You know, I think I'll move to Hollywood and, uh, deliver babies for movie stars. Movie stars don't have babies, they have... agents. I'm gonna miss you. I really appreciate what you did for me, Peter... - Now, listen, it's okay, David. - No, no, no, no. That... that, prison, I'm telling you, it was something else. By the way, my mother wants you to know she's saying Buddhist prayers for you to get well. Oh, well, listen, if God is Chinese we're in good shape then, huh. He is. - Hey. - Huh. You scared me. - How are you? - How are you? - How do I look? - Distinguished. Ah, scar me again, I'm too good looking. Phew. What's the matter? [instrumental music] My husband came home last night. Oh, yeah? Just in time for dinner. How is he? Thin. Tan. Contrite. You gonna let him stay? He says he's changed. Says he's grown up. He says he wants to settle down. You believe that? I, I believe it's time for some order in my life. Anyways he says he loves me. What do you say to that? What do you say? I say tell him it snowed in Park City. What? Tell him there's two feet of fresh powder over an eight-foot pack at Alger. Tell him, the weather's clear and there's no wind in Stowe and we'll send him his stocking cap. Look, we'll pack up Jessy, these comic books, Band-Aids, Oreo cookies. [chuckles] I'll take you back and introduce you to my mother and father. [instrumental music] [laughs] Jessy... Jessy, he's... He has to stop every ten miles in the gas station. We can work that out. [upbeat music] [music continues]
