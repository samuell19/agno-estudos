There are places in my neighborhood no one ever thinks about. And you see them every day and every day you forget about them. These are the places where all the things happen that people are not allowed to see. You see, in Brooklyn, money changes hands all night long. It's just not the kind you can deposit in a bank. But all that money needs to end up somewhere. They call it a drop bar. A bar the bosses choose randomly each night... to be the safe for an entire city. You never know up front when your bar becomes the drop bar. You just take all the city's dirtiest money... and bag men come and go from all over town... and nobody ever sees it coming. Nobody ever sees it going. And then they could tell you to be the drop bar next week. Or maybe even next year. The point is, you never know. In the meantime... me... I just tend bar. And wait. Hey, Bobby, you want to sprinkle the infield with The General for us? This is fucking awesome. We spend $80 million... to drag a bunch of Jersey geriatrics across the river to wet-shit their Depends. - The old guard. - They're not that old. Oh, really? You see Stackhouse block LeBron with his walker? Gentlemen, these are on the house. When he speaks, he says nice things. - Rardy, can you clean that up? - All right, if it's for Richie. You got new pants, Sully? Yeah, I'll send them to the dry cleaners. - Rardy, we're not thanking you. - Fuck you. Fucking sphinx, that guy. - Cousin Marv, thanks for the drink. - Thanks a lot, Marv. Somebody want to say something for the kid? - Sully, go ahead. - Yeah, Sully, do it up. Richie "Glory Days" Whelan. Fort Hamilton, class of '92 and a funny prick. May he rest in peace. Glory Days. Fucking A. Let me guess. You bought them the round. Yeah. They're only... They're celebrating the anniversary of a very close friend, Marv. The kid's been dead, what... 10 years now? Ought to be a point where you move on. Stop scoring free drinks off a corpse. Speaking of which, can't keep letting her ride a stool and not pay for her drinks. - Who, Millie? - Yeah, Millie. She doesn't drink that much. When's the last time you charged her for anything? It's Millie, you know. Yeah. After midnight, you let her smoke in here even though that's illegal. You think I didn't know about that? If she can't pay her tab tonight, she don't come back in here till she does. Her bar tab is, like, 120 bucks. - It's about $140. - But she can't afford it, you know? Yeah, I'm gonna start crying now. Okay? You know what? Get all the candy canes and Christmas shit down. It's December 27th. All right? Come on. Gentlemen. Why don't you go fuck yourselves? ...hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Peace be with you. Peace be with you. Peace be with you. Body of Christ. The Body of Christ. The Body of Christ. The Body of Christ. That's not good. What are you doing in there? All right. All right, now. Hey. What are you doing in my trash? You have a dog in your trash can. It's a boxer. Jesus. You have a dog here in your trash. This one's bleeding. - What's your name? - Bob Saginowski. Let me see your license. My license? My wallet is in my pocket. You'll have to take it out. I just sent that picture to four people. We clear? - He's freezing. - Yeah, well, it's cold. Let's bring him inside. I'm Nadia, by the way. Is it bad? It's not that deep, but, man. Someone beat the shit out of this dog. See these knots? That's not skull, that's contusions. Are you a vet? No, I'm a waitress at the Ashmont Grill. But I worked at Animal Rescue one summer as a tech. Careful. They're so hard, this breed. To find them a home. - Boxers? - This isn't a boxer. It's a pit bull. That's a dangerous dog. It's not the dog's fault his owner is a dick. This guy... look at him. He's nothing but sweet. You'll need a crate... makes them feel safe. I have something you can borrow. And food and chew toys and stuff. But I was, I was just passing a garbage can. I can't... - I'll just take him back. - To who? The guy who beat him? I'll take him to the proper authorities. - That would be the shelter. - Right. After they give the owner seven days to reclaim him, if he decides not to take it... this dog will be put up for adoption. But who knows what kind of person will take him? Could be anyone? I don't know. You can take him. You take him. I work nights. I work a lot. We'll have to send him to Animal Rescue. Okay, look, can you, can you give me a couple days to think about it? Please? I have to think about this. It's a big responsibility. I don't know anything about... Please, just a couple days. I'll come back. Please, a couple days. Hold him till the weekend. Just the weekend. It's a couple days. Please. Please. Saturday morning. Thank you. I gotta go. All right. Thank you. Saturday. - Bob? The dog needs a name. - Right. Oh, my God. You're going to be okay. Do you know a Nadia Dunn? Nadia Dunn? You don't? - You don't know her? - No. That's the girl who's holding the dog. The dog again. You know, I was thinking that training a dog... housebreaking, and all that, that's... I mean, that is a huge responsibility, right? - Well, it's a dog. - Yeah. It's not like some long-lost retarded relative shows up in a wheelchair... a colostomy bag hanging out of his ass. Says, "I'm yours now. Take care of me." It's not that. It's a dog. Yeah. What? - What? - No. It's a fucking bad idea. We should hit it for everything or not at all. Little brother, listen. My guy says we got to show him that we can handle our shit. Says we do it in steps. See how the owners respond. They could respond pretty fucking bad, you nut. So that's what we'll see. Your guy. Your fucking guy talks a whole hell of a lot. - It's a fucking drop bar. - Not tonight it isn't. Okay? Okay. Don't think about it, just fill it. - All right, we won't cause any trouble. - You're making trouble! - Do you know what the fuck you're doing? - Marv. - Do you know whose money this is? - Fucking fill the bag! All right. Just take it easy. There you go. Go ahead. You fucking talk too much. Where's Rardy? Rardy? What the fuck? - You all right? - Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick. - I'm okay. - Look at his head. Fucking split open. We got to call an ambulance. That's bad. Rardy, don't move. Just stay where you are. - How bad do I look? - Don't move. It's not good. Here. I'm putting something on your head. Hold that. There's one for your face. The 8 o'clock at St. Dom's. Every morning we see each other and we've never met. - Detective Evandro Torres. - Hi. I'm Bob Saginowski. - A shame about St. Dom's. - What do you mean? I just found out they're folding it into St. Mary's. Can you believe that? I did not know that. - You're the bartender? - Yeah. The guys with the guns... Want to take a walk? Yeah, sure. They sound like anyone who ever came in here before? Nah. The guy closest to me, I could see that his watch had stopped. Officer Bernardo says you said they were covered head to toe? Hoodies, masks? Yeah, but I could see his wrist as it was turning. The face of the watch was in front of me, like that. - And it was stopped? - Yeah. It said 6:15. - How much they take you for? - Well, whatever was in the register. So, if I was to ask around, I wouldn't hear anything about... anyone making book here, or someone moving money around? Excuse me? - I wouldn't hear that? - Nah. - Do you have insurance, Rardy? - What do you think? No, we don't have insurance. - The whole thing's a travesty. - Yeah, he took a pretty bad hit. Nah, I meant St. Dom's. Yeah. Yeah. Beautiful church. They did Mass right. No group hugs after the Our Father. No folk singers. By the time the seculars get done persecuting the Church... all we'll have left is a bunch of condos with stained glass windows. What's up with the surveillance cameras in there? They don't record. They're just a deterrent for crime. Why don't you take Communion? Excuse me? I've seen you at Mass for years. You haven't taken Communion once. Well, you know, that's my business. You think so, huh? Yeah, I think so. Jesus. I fucking know so. So was he gonna let you wear his letter jacket... or did you have to let him twist your nipples a couple of times first? Why the fuck would you tell that cop about the watch? - I don't know. - You don't know. It just came out. Well, next time, why don't you nip that impulse in the fucking bud? - What the fuck is wrong with you? - It was very unlike me, Marv. They took us for five thou and some change. - Five thousand? - Yeah. Thank God they picked up the envelope, so we're not on the hook for that. So we're all right. We're okay. No, they took us for five large and some change. - It's their bar, it's their money. - Okay. They're going to want it back. So we're not so fucking okay. Bob? - You all right? - Yeah. - Kind of early for the eight. - Yeah. I figured I could wait. Well, come on in. - It's just a bowl and some food. - Thank you. Thank you. - Good luck. - Thank you. You know, I've never owned a dog before... so, you know... I have no idea what I'm doing. At all. You'll need bowls. A leash. Poop bags. And from now on, keep your shoes up on a shelf. Let me see if I can find the bed section. What do you want? This is the best book I know. You should read it. Everything is in here. What are you gonna name him? Well, I was thinking about maybe Rocco. I like the name Rocco. But then I thought Mike. Mike? - You don't like Mike? - No. Mike is not a great name for a dog. Rocco is better. Okay. So did they name you Nadia after the gymnast? - Yeah. - So you're a gymnast? No. Here you go. See? "Rocco". Hey, he likes it. Yeah, I like Mike. - You have him? - Yeah. Yeah. Be patient. - Bye. - Bye, thank you. "Make sure the bottoms of the two side panels rest inside the bottom." Hey, Rocco? I made you a safe place. Bob? Cold one, huh? Who needs snow blower when you have Bob? Maybe you come to my house later. Sure. I'm kidding. This guy. - You on the welfare? - I'm sorry? Bob does all the work. You watch. No, I was shoveling. - You're shoveling, all right. - He was. Come. You know this guy? No. But I know this guy. Moment I know him, I know him. Somebody robbed my bar. Yes. That's right. I'm sorry, Mr. Umarov. Call my father Mr. Umarov. Bob... - call me Chovka, eh? - Yeah. That's right, I'm sorry, Mr. Chovka, somebody did rob your bar. Who robbed our bar? - We don't know. They wore masks. - That's right. So we couldn't see. Police report says one wore a broken watch. You tell them this? Yeah, I did. I wasn't thinking. It just came out. So what are you doing to get my father's money back? - Well, we put the word out. - Yeah. - In the neighborhood. - That's right. They got the word out in the neighborhood. So the word is out there, huh? - The word. - That's right. With my money. Find my fucking money. "Find my money." If we knew where their money was, it would mean we knew who robbed us. Which would mean we were in on it, which means they'd shoot us in the face. These fucking Chechnyans. Chechens, Marv. What? They're Chechens. They're from Chechnya, but you call them Chechens. Yeah, they're from Chechnya. Yeah, I said that. You don't call people from Ireland Irelandians, do you? What the fuck are you talking about? Yo, yo. What's the sunset nightcap this evening? - You bring your own cup? - What, I just got out of the womb? - Cheers. - Salud. - So what up, Evandro? - You remember Marvin Stipler? Cousin Marv? He got pushed off his own book, nine, ten years ago, by the Chechens. His bar got held up. The bar's owned by one of Papa Umarov's shell companies. What kind of dumb-ass holds up one of his bars? You got me. Major Crimes up on the Umarovs? We barely survived the last budget cuts. We're not sticking our heads up to go after some Russian John Q barely knows exists. Chechen. You want him, he's all yours. Hey, baby brother, you ready to eat? - What? - Are you ready to eat? No. - What are you talking about? - I ate already. - I ate already. - When did you eat? I ate. Oh, no. Hey, hey, no. Rocco, stay there. Stay there. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't jump. Crikey Jesus. That was close. You gave me a heart attack. - Where the fuck you been? - Getting here. - You got any of the money? - No. - What do you mean, no? - I mean no 'cause fucking Bri has it. Bri has it. - Did you tell your brother about me? - No. Why the fuck you hit Rardy so hard? - I had to. - You had to. And I had to call an ambulance. Now we got an ambulance and cops. What's with his watch? People noticed it's broke. Tell him to get a new one and get rid of that one. Today. What's the next step? When do we hit a real drop bar? Let's just assume I'm not some asshole without a plan, all right? When an airplane goes down, what's the safest airline to fly the next day? The one that had the crash. Right. There you go. So we just gotta wait. I don't understand a fucking word you're saying. - It's like you're speaking Brazilian. - Just let me take care of it, all right? - Keep your head down. - All right. It's not Brazilian. Brazilians speak Portuguese. - Where you going? - Where am I going? I'm leaving. Stay here. We can't be seen together, remember, genius? - Fuck you. How long? - I don't fucking know. Ten minutes! Sit. Sit. No, that's standing. Come here. Go, go. Oh, man. - Hey! - Hey! - How you doing? - Good. Shit. Rocco, come on! - Come. Good boy. - You didn't read the book, did you? Some of it, yeah. No. Not a lot. I was thinking... now the holiday's over... I lost a shift at the restaurant. I'm sorry. So maybe you could hire me, you know? Pay me to babysit Rocco when you're working? Hey, well, that's not such a bad idea. I work a lot at the bar. That would be very kind of you. Yeah. - You have a number I can call? - Yeah. Maybe call you. You want to arrange this properly? Just put it there. - Have you got a pen? - No. I think I have a pen. Where's that pen when you need it? Okay. - Does it work? - Yeah. - Rocco. - Here you go. Great. That's a great idea. - And I need a key. - Yeah, yeah. Well, like, maybe I could... if you call me, I'll either have it... and drop it around yours, or I could leave it at the bar for you. Call me. Yeah, I'll call you... on this number you gave me right now. - Bye. - Happy New Year, by the way! Oh, yeah. Happy New Year! We should join that show. You can't fucking sing. Not that one, the other one, where the people go around the world picking up clues and stuff. It'd be cool. Let's do it. We could see things. - Yeah, what things? - I don't know. Other countries. Other ways. You see the old man today? Yeah, I was by. They want their money, Marv. - Who? - The home. They'll get it. It's the collection agency now, not the home. Medicaid cutbacks. Me retiring. They're going to ship him out. To where? To a lesser place. Maybe it's time. Yeah. Yeah. Just kill him. Our father. Because it's inconvenient. He's dead, Marv. So what are all those beeps coming out of the machines he's hooked up to, and the waves on the screen of the thing? - That's life. - That's electricity, that's what that is. The other day, I picked up his hand and put it on my cheek. And I could hear his blood. So you want to unplug him? Go ahead, your decision. Take it easy. No, make the decision. I'll be all right with it. That'd be a first. Never mind. It's okay. I'll get to Europe in another life. Rocco. Come to heel. Come to heel. Come to heel. And sit. - You see that? - Yeah, I saw it. He almost gave me the paw. When I watch TV, he sleeps on my leg. - Really? - Out. - Come, come. - I'll be right back. All right. Crazy. Come on. That's a nice dog. - Thank you. I appreciate it. - Yeah. Yeah, that's a nice-looking dog. Don't forget to feed it, all right? Tell me where the hospital is? Bang a U-ey, go down to the end here. Take a right. There'll be signs. Thanks. I promise, tomorrow I'll take you to the park. But I'm in a mad rush today. I will be back very soon. Hey, man, how you doing? Mind if I step in? It's kind of cold outside. Thanks a lot. Jesus. - Can I help you? - Yeah. Where are you keeping him? What are you talking about? I'm talking the dog. You keep him in the kitchen? The cellar? I remember you. You came up to me in the park and told me I had a nice-looking dog. Yeah, well, he's not your dog. - Yeah, he's my dog. - Yeah? You register him? City says you have to license it. How about a chip? - Excuse me? - A security chip. They implanted in the dogs. Pooch goes missing, shows up at a vet. Vet scans the dog. Up pops a barcode with the owner's info. The owner, meanwhile, walks around with a slip of paper. It has the security chip account number on it. Check it out. You got my dog. No, it's my dog. You beat him. I'll tell the cops you did. What do you want? It's kind of sunny, right? But you never know, I guess. You never ask about it. You're the only person I ever met who didn't ask about it in the first five minutes. It's your business, not mine. You'll tell me when you tell me, or you won't. I did it to myself. I was pretty high. - You did that? - Yeah. With one of those... like, a peeler. - Peeler? - You know, a potato peeler? Oh, God, yeah, I know what that is, right. I was a different person then. I didn't really like myself. And do you like yourself now? Excuse me, sir. You cannot have a dog in here. Dog goes, you guys go, okay? And I'm telling you... - ...I got guys following me. - You don't have guys following you. Yes, I do. I told you about the guy in the car. He was asking you for directions. It was the way he asked. The way he was looking at me. I'm not a fucking idiot. What about you? The guy with the umbrella. He's just interested in the dog. The dog. How do you know? Maybe he's just telling you that. It's too much for them to put them back where they found them, because that would require courtesy. You should just get a dumpster, Marv. "Just get a dumpster, Marv. Get a dumpster." Sure. You remember I don't own the bar anymore, right? Yeah. Yeah, but it's not your bar Chovka took. - That was 10 years ago. - No, it was eight-and-a-half years ago. All right. Eight-and-a-half years. Dottie thinks we should visit Europe. That's what I've become... a guy that goes to Europe with his sister. Hops in a, a tour bus... with a fucking camera around my neck like a fucking jerkoff. What? You need to see this, Marv. No, I don't. I don't need to do anything. I'm just going to stand right here. I'm going to stand right the fuck here. No. You really should take a look at this. I don't need to see Europe. I don't need to see Dottie. And I don't need to see what's in that bag. What the fuck? We need to do something with it. - What, the money or the... thing? - I bet... Whatever's in here adds up to what we lost the other night. Why'd they give it back to us? So we give it back to them. That's clearly what they expect. Like you're wrapping a piece of meat. Like you've done it a thousand times. Do you wonder if you hadn't mentioned the watch maybe... - No, I don't. - Well, I do. Hi, guys. You got any Zima? No, we're closed. Well, your door was unlocked, so... I'm sorry about that, but we're closed now, so... - Yeah. Yeah. - You got to go. Hey, Bob. How you doing? Nice to see you. - All right, come on. - Yeah. Say hi to Nadia. Don't forget to stitch her up when she stabs herself, all right? Tossing the missing piece of the One-Armed Man around like a ham... and the front door's open! - He didn't see anything. - But he could've. But he didn't. You know that guy? Yeah. That's the guy I was telling you about with Rocco. The one who claims the dog is his? - You know who else he is? - No. He's the guy who says he killed Richie Whelan. - That guy? - Yeah. - That's Eric Deeds? - Yeah, that's Eric Deeds. And he's fucked in the squash, that guy. He's been in the joint a couple times. He did a 30-day in the cuckoo house, if I recall. So you watch that fucking kid. Some fucking day, Marv. Yeah, some fucking day. Will you pass me the sports bag by the wasp-and-ants spray? Yeah, sure, I'd love to. Thank you. I'm going for a walk now. Okay. Fucking Christ. Don't look at that. Don't look at it. All right. Hey, hey, what's this? Go get it. Go on. Yeah, play with it. My big red bone. Go get it. Go get that! Get the bone! - Shit. - Mr. Saginowski. - How you doing? - I'm good. We haven't caught them yet. Yeah, well, you know, I assumed... You assumed that we didn't do our job? No, I just heard it was hard to make an arrest on robbery cases. - What's up with the bag? - This is... It's my poop bag and sometimes I keep leashes and balls... - and stuff in my bag. - Kind of empty. Yeah, well, I used my last poop bag and I lost the ball. Richie Whelan. - What about him? - You know him? Sure. His friends were in the bar the other day, toasting his anniversary. - What anniversary? - Of the last time anybody saw him. - Which was at your bar. - That's right. Yeah, he left. He took his car and they found it someplace. Astoria. Torched. - That's a good-looking dog. - Thank you. You know an Eric Deeds? Tall guy? Beard? He's, like, a brooder? Maybe. I mean, you working in that bar. Come on. You know people, Mr. Saginowski. I got a picture. - Nah. You think maybe he robbed the bar? - No. I'm hearing here and there that this guy has something to do with the Whelan disappearance. Really? That's a really good-looking dog. I came by to give him his afternoon walk. - Great. - I freaked. Is your cell on? Yeah, but it's on vibrate. I couldn't feel it. - I called a bunch of times. - I know, I could see that. I'm sorry. - I thought you were working today. - I am, it's just I had this... You know what? It's a really long story. I'm sorry. I should have called you. I apologize for that. It's okay. Hey. So you know Eric Deeds, huh? What? No. I don't "know him" know him, you know? I know him from around. So you don't know him? Not really, no. That's funny, because the way he said it, I figured... - Figured what? - I don't know. You know, maybe... - I don't know. - Why are you on my ass about it? - I was just asking a question. - No, you were insinuating. No, I wasn't. Now you're arguing just to argue with me. No. - See? - I'm not. I don't need this shit, okay? Wait. What happened here? Did I say something wrong? You think you can push me around? No. Wait. Don't you fucking touch me. I don't understand. I asked her one question. A question. Simple. And then it all came out sideways. You don't get it. They get in a mood... you could give them the Hope Diamond and they'd complain about the weight. Am I right? Bob, you ain't actually talking about a girl, are you? - Bobby's got himself a girl? - Yeah. Guy gets a dog, becomes a pussy magnet. They're flinging it at my man now. I'm gonna go play some pool. How are you? Chovka, let me get you a drink. Marv? Stella... Andre, he drinks Stella. There you go. Here it is. I put it in a Ziploc. But it's all there. You can count it. - Ziploc? - Yeah, well, it was a little wet. I was going to dry it, but we don't have a dryer. So I figured I'd put it in a Ziploc. If you spread it out on a table, it should be good come the morning. I have no idea what you're talking about, Bob. - This isn't what you gave me last time. - That? No, that's not the Bowmore 18. Before you didn't like it. You said it smelled like feet. I figured that you would prefer this a lot more. This is very special. It's Irish. We die. All of us... Andre. But before you do, you gotta to try this fucking whiskey, man. Yeah, get him one. Come on. Here. You handle the drop. All right. Which night? Super Bowl. Okay. Is good. Detective Evandro Torres. - Jimmy Sullivan. - Thanks for seeing me. So you got nothing else about the night Glory Days vanished? The only thing I remember about that night was that he left the bar to score weed. And the guys he got it from were a couple of shitheads. A nutjob named Deeds and his junkie buddy... what was his name? Tim Brennan. He was in the original statement. Yeah, that's the guy. He was going to see them both? Or only one of them? I don't know. I don't remember. But Bob Saginowski and Cousin Marv? - You trying to tie them to this? - Nah, I just... You got me out here in front of the guys I work with, looking like a snitch. Thanks for that, by the way. But Cousin Marv's place? That's my bar. All right? Don't fuck with my bar. You know, I'm... - I'm sorry. - I don't care if you know him. It's just that... the way that he said hi, you know, it sounded like it meant something. I was just asking. What else did he say? He said that Rocco was his. That he has a chip in his neck to prove it. He used to be my boyfriend. In the beginning, he was charming. He was really nice. I know a lot of people said things about him, but I don't judge people. I don't want to prejudge people. Sure. It just became too much. I haven't seen him in a while. I thought he was gone. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - I'm sorry. - You don't have to explain. Everybody has a past. And if this guy put Rocco in your trash, that's not your fault. And as for Rocco, he won't blame you. You know? He don't know no better. He's not just going to go away. Eric? No. He doesn't strike me as the type that wants to do that. He's not. He killed a kid named Glory Days. Yeah. Yeah. I heard that. I heard that. - Richie Whelan. - Yeah. Why? I don't know. He's not a big fan of "why". Eric. It's broken. Yeah, it is. Do you want me to fix it? - You want to fix it? - Yeah. Sure. - You want another beer? - Yeah. So I heard that Cousin Marv doesn't own the bar? That some hard guys do. But you're not a hard guy. So why do you work there? You know me and Cousin Marv go way back, right? Yeah, Marv is actually my cousin. - Yeah? - Yeah. Marv and his sister, Dottie... his father and my mother, they're all sisters. - Really? - Yeah. - Did they share makeup? - Why would they do that? You said they were sisters. You're right. Yeah. You know what I mean. Why are you jumping on me like that? - It's fun. - Fun. Fun. Yeah, Marv thought he was a tough guy. We had a crew once. Back in the day, when we was young, we made a little money but it was never, you know... So a mean crew rolls into town, and, you know... we flinched. That's it. End of the crew. - But you're still in the life. - Me? - Yeah. - No. No. No, no, no. No, I just tend the bar. - What are you doing? Get in the car. - You fucking come out here. - Are you nuts? It's freezing! Get in. - I'm not getting in the car! - You think the trunk's lined with plastic? - How am I supposed to fucking know? Here, go look then. Go ahead. Don't you fuck with me. Don't you fucking dare! - Nobody's fucking with you. - You hear? - All right? - Yeah. Want to call your mommy and tell her you're okay or what? Don't make any fucking jokes. Last time anybody saw my brother alive, - he got in a car with a guy. - All right. You're right. I'm sorry. Take it easy. What we got here is a risk-versus-reward kind of thing. We already took the risk. And up to now, it's not been working out so well, I know. Yeah, but? But I know where the Super Bowl drop off's gonna be. So if you want to hit them back for Bri, you hit them back for a million. - It's suicide. Fucking suicide. - I got news for you, Fitzy. We're fucking dead already, we're just still walking around. - The only way to get out is to leave. - I'm not doing another one, man. - You're not? - I'm not. - You sure about that? - Yeah, I'm fucking sure. - Okay, I'll square it with you then. - All right. I'm buying something with it. Number one, you don't tell anybody what we just talked about. You don't tell anybody. Second, I need a place to hole up for a couple days. What, you're on the street? - Fucking trunk. You didn't close it. - I closed it that fucking thing. Not very well. I closed that fucking thing. Forget about the trunk. No, I'm not on the street. Everybody knows where I live. Nobody knows where you live. So can I shack up with you tonight or maybe tomorrow night? Not with me, but I know a place. All right? Got cable? - Motherfucker, what? - You know, cable. Fuck you. You gotta get behind it! Slam it with two hands! Here you are. - Good night. - Good night. I got that. - Bob? - Yeah? - Thanks. - For what? Good night. Good night. Sorry I was so long. I didn't take you with me. You want a chewie? Here. There you go. For you. - Mind if I sit down? - No, have a seat. What's up? I was wondering why you don't like my cousin. He took my dog. He didn't take your dog. You beat the crap out of it and put it in a garbage can. I felt bad about it. That count? - Yeah. - Okay, good. And now you want it back. What kind of question is that? I don't know what I want. I don't know. But I don't want him walking around thinking he's the shit. I know that. - He needs to learn. - Learn what? That he shouldn't have fucked with me. - Are you fucking with me? - Me? No, no. I'm too old for that shit. I come in peace. - Why is that? Is there a war? - Not that I know of. Good. When you came into the bar the other night, you made my cousin nervous. You don't see that often. But I think there's a way you and I can sort that out... and both be happy. Look at you. You're looking good. Eric Deeds' psych file. You got three minutes to read it. And there better be no grease on those fingers. - Well, I'll be damned. - Like you fucking weren't already? What? Not what you were expecting? My file? Yeah. You know what you're gonna do? You got to give me 10. - Why? - Ten grand. By tomorrow morning. - Who's got $10,000? - Come on. Listen. You want the dog, you give me 10. Simple. Listen here, pal. You can't walk into people's lives and expect them to... Listen, listen. Take it easy. Listen to me. That is life. That's what it is. People like me coming along when you're not looking. Just get my money, 10:00 a.m., your place, all right? And if you don't get it, I'll go to the cops and get my dog back. Simple. And then I'll forget to feed it for a while. And then when the dog gets all yappy about it... I'll beat his fucking head with a rock. All right? You picture that. Yeah. Remember what I did to Richie Whelan. - Yep. - Yeah? What I'm trying to say is, I had a partner back then. I still have him. You all right? Okay. It was good to see you. - Hey, Bobby, how's it going? - I'm good. How you doing? Good. What's happening? I thought you took early retirement. What are you gonna you do? I'll do another year or two. Hope the phlebitis don't get too bad. See how I feel. Marv? - Yeah? - I'm heading out to work. - Good day, Dot. - You, too! Are you going to eat something? - Yeah. - Okay. Biggest day in the world tomorrow, I can't seem to get you on the phone. Yeah. I forgot to tell you, I don't feel good... so I'm not coming in. Call the BarTemps. I did already. Super Bowl. We always use them. - So what do you need me for? - I don't. But... you're blowing off the biggest tip day of the year. What, I work for tips now? You ever go to the front of the bar and take a look at the sign on the bar? Whose name is on it? That's my name. 'Cause I used to own it once. Yeah, you been playing that flute a long time now. And you've been... awfully fresh since you got that dog that you mistake for a kid. Marv, you can't redo it. All right? They pressed, you blinked. It's done. It's over. It's been over for a while now. Well, I'm not the guy who wasted his entire life waiting for it to start. I did that? At least I had something once. I was respected. I was feared. When I walked into a place, people sat up. They sat up straight. They noticed. What'd you ever have? And the fucking bar stool you put that old biddy at. You bought her free drinks and don't think I don't know that you did it on purpose? That was my stool and nobody sat on that stool because it was Cousin Marv's stool. And that meant something. That meant something! But it didn't. Ever. It was just a stool. Are you doing something desperate? Again? Marv? Are you doing something that maybe we can't clean up this time? I told you, I don't feel good. So why don't you get the fuck out of here? Really. Good-bye, Marv. I hope you feel better soon. Don't forget to eat something. The Body of Christ. The Body of Christ. The Body of Christ. The Body of Christ. The Body of Christ. Should we go? Let's move out. Rocco, I'm gonna have to lock you down in a sec. We have a long day. Hey, Didi, how you doing? I got to... I got to talk to you. I want to take you someplace tonight. It's a lot of fun. Then we're out of here. Hi. How you doing? What do you want? I don't want you here. Please leave. No, listen to me. You need to sit down and listen to me, all right? I want you to go. This is my home. I'm not your girl anymore. I want you to leave. Come on, take a seat. Come on. Don't play that shit. Sit down. You look good, by the way. We're going somewhere tonight, all right? It's gonna be a lot of fun. And after that, we're out of here, okay? I want you to go. Please. You're going to go. And make yourself pretty, all right? Good to see you, man. - Where you been? - I came back to see you, Jimmy. He said, I'm coming right back for you. Ladies and gentlemen, please rise and remove your hats... as we honor America with the singing of our national anthem. Two Dos Equis, three Amstel, two shots of Jack and a Dewar's on the rocks. - You hear that, Rardy? - Coming up. Bob? Bob? Bob! - Can I get two more Heineken on 1-3? - Rardy? Two more Heineken. - White wine, right? - Yeah. Can you get me a Stoli rocks and a house Chard for the lady? I didn't see you this morning. Yeah, so what? So you don't want the money? - You bring it? - What? Did you bring the money? You strike me as the type who would bring it. - Two Stella and an Amstel. - Sure. Rardy, can I get two Amstels and a Stella? Why is she here? She's my girl. Give me that piece of paper and you get the money. What paper? The microchip and the license, like we agreed. Why would I do that? Because that's why I'm paying you the money. That's the deal. - That's a deal. Hold on a second. - Excuse me? You can keep the change. Keep the change. Two Stellas and one Amstel. What's up? Hold on. Wait a minute. I can't talk right now. Wait a second. Here you go. - What's that noise? Where are you? - I'm at the place. Your place. The bar? Why the fuck you show up so early? This was simple. You show up at the designated time, do the thing and leave. I know what he seems like, but I shit you not, do not fuck with him. Stay away from him. He already thinks you want to kill him over some fucking dog. - Just stay in the back. - Yeah, I got it. And you're in a bar. Don't drink too much. I'll see you at 2:00, you fucking idiot. What an amazing game! Twenty-seven to 23, your final score! - Are you with him? - No. So why are you here? - What were you talking about? - I told you, nothing. Bob. Yeah, we do. This is not good. This is so not good. I don't want to be here. I didn't want to come here. He was waiting in my house when I got home. I'm sorry, Bob. He has a gun. Just going to the ladies'. - What were you guys talking about? - Football. Give me another shot, will you? What was the name of your partner again? Wouldn't be much of a threat if you knew who he was, would he, Bob? Yeah, but... he helped you kill Richie Whelan, right? - That's the rumor, Bob. - More than a rumor. That's what you said. Yeah, well, then it's more than a rumor, Bob. What time is it? You know, you really don't have to keep calling me Bob all the time. I'll see what I can do, Bob. What is that? The 10 grand you wanted. This is 10 grand? Yeah. You know what I think? I'm going to look in the safe at 2:00. Time lock goes off at 2:00 a.m. You got 90 seconds to close it... or it triggers two silent alarms. We should look in the safe at 2:00. Now you listen. I'm happy to pay you 10 grand for the dog. Yeah. Ten grand for the dog. - But that's it. - Yeah. And how much for her? How about that? How much should he pay for you? Eric, please. Please don't do this. - Where's Marv? - Marv? - You need him for something? - I don't want anything. I just don't want him creeping up my back all of a sudden. Yeah, my sweet cousin Marv. You know he's had some trouble, Marv. Yeah. Like, about 10 years ago, man, he had... - He had a problem with the cards. - Yeah. I didn't know that, Bob. But he was more of a loan shark back then. And I remember this kid... he was into him for a shitload of money. Hopeless case when it came to the dogs and B-ball. Just degenerate, really. Kind of kid who'd never be able to pay back what he owed. - It's 1:57, all right? - And then the kid goes to A.C. and he hits up a slot machine for 22 grand. Bam. Who'd have thunk it? It was, like, a fraction more than what he owed Marv. Yeah, so? He didn't pay him back and you roughed him up. No, no. That's not what happened. He paid back Marv, every cent. - He was a good guy. - It's 1:58, all right? What he didn't account for was Marv skimming off his own stash. Because of his habits and his gambling debts. And this kid coming out of the blue with 22 grand was a... what'd he say? "A viable business opportunity." That's my cousin Marv. So long as nobody knew that he'd paid Marv back off, you know? - You see where this is going? - Yeah, kid had to be ripped off. No. Kid had to be killed. So nobody'd know he'd paid Marv back off. So that's what we did. - So you... - Yeah. - ...killed him. - Yeah, I did. I shot him in the face, twice. Then I wrapped his head in a towel and stabbed him in the heart... so he would bleed out, put him in my bathtub and watched him drain. Then I put him in an oil tank... with laundry detergent and lye and sealed it back up. Want to know what his name was? It's 2:00, Bob. It's 2:00. His name. - I would not know, Bob. - Yes, you do. This is something you know. - I wouldn't know that, Bob. - Guess. - Yeah? - Yeah. I know it's 2:00, and you got to open the safe! Listen to me. His name... was Richie Whelan. Everybody called him Glory Days? I killed Richie Whelan, all right? Sure you did. Fucking punk. Go out for dinner dressed like you're still in your living room. You wear those big hippity-hoppity clown shoes. You speak to women terribly. You treat them despicably. You hurt harmless dogs that can't defend themselves. I'm tired of you, man. I'm tired of you. You embarrass me. You know, he would've kept coming back that's why he would've done. People like this, they take something from you and you let them... and they just act like they keep coming back. And you still owe them something and they never, never change. You can never change their mind. You just... I mean, you just fucking shot him. Yes, I did. Absolutely. He was going to hurt our dog. Bob? Can I... can I go now? Yeah, of course. You can. So you... you'll let me go? Sure, sure. Why not? And, and nobody will ever hurt you again. Okay? This is done. Okay? You got your stuff? Go on now. But now... now you'll think I'll talk. - I won't talk, Bob. - I know you won't. I promise. I won't. Nadia, you can't. Not with these people. They won't... Your people, Bob. No, they're not my... I'm not them. And I'm not this. You've seen better days, huh? Andre? He just came in. Yeah, that's right. When I opened up the door. I was just letting Millie out, and... Put a gun in your face, but you said, "Not tonight," huh? - I didn't say anything. - You ever see him before? Yeah. Yeah, he was in here. Over there, watching the game. Caught my attention 'cause he was on his own. Maybe he wasn't. - No, he was, though. - Or maybe he wasn't. I'm sorry, I don't follow you. Sure you do. You say he was on his own, alone. I say he wasn't. What's to follow? You. You're alone. Sometimes it's good to be alone. Say it. Say it. I'm alone. No way, my man. You have friends. Speaking of friends, your cousin Marv? He told me he's retiring. He want you to be the boss of the bar. I said, "Of course, it's your bar." "But it's not your money." "So why you always trying to take my money?" So I made him a deal. "You and your druggy friends leave my money alone... and I'll pay you a ticket to a nice, quiet place." So what do you think? Take down his name, put up yours. "Bob's Bar." Has a nice ring to it, huh? "Bob's Bar." "Bob's Big Bad Bar." I'm kidding, my friend. Lighten up. Sure. - Did he fit? - Yeah. Had to break his legs, but he fit fine. Smile. Don't mind, everything's gonna be okay. Get some rest. Good night. Good night. There are some sins you commit that you can't come back from... no matter how hard you try. You just can't, you know? It's like the devil is waiting for your body to quit. Because he knows... he knows that... he already owns your soul. And then I think, maybe, you know, there is no devil. You die, and God, He says: "Nah." "Nah, you can't come in. You have to leave now." "You have to leave and go away and you have to be alone." "You have to be alone forever." I'm sorry to hear about Cousin Marv. It was a carjacking gone bad is what they said. Carjacking? Right. That was an execution. A block and a half from this bar. Anyway, it fucking sucks and I'm really sorry. Thank you. Are you going to the church closing tomorrow? - Yeah, of course I am. - I don't know yet. I got a shift. They sold it. To Milligan Development. What'd I tell you? It's gonna be condos with stained glass windows. Eric Deeds. I mentioned him to you once. Yeah, I remember. - You didn't then. - I remember you mentioning him. He was in this bar Super Bowl Sunday. You see him? No. There was a lot of people in here on Super Bowl Sunday, so... Yeah, that's true. It's just this was the last place he was ever seen and then... Just like Richie Whelan. Ironic, 'cause Deeds supposedly killed Whelan. Bodies getting clipped or vanishing all over the place, but... come on, man, you don't see anything? Nah. You know, that's this neighborhood, right? But he could turn up. People do all the time. That's true. If he does, it'll probably be in a psych ward. Which is where he was the night Whelan disappeared. I'm not lying. It's true. Deeds always took credit for the Whelan hit 'cause nobody else wanted to. He thought it would help his street cred... - but he didn't kill Whelan. - He didn't? Yeah. No one ever sees you coming, do they, Bob? Rocco. Something we got to do. When you left the bar, I know that meant stay away. I know that meant stay away, but you didn't say it. So if you say it, then I will just go. Believe me, Nadia, I will leave right now. But you have to say it. Let me go get my jacket. Yeah? Sure, great. Great.
