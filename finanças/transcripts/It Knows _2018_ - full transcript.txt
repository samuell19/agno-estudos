No! Where are you? I'm behind you! Get on your knees. What? Do it. And see what happens. Good. Now, take the knife... And kill yourself. Monroe, now you slow down. Look, you need to take it easy. Come on, Monroe. Keys? Look, why don't we just go back to the house. Now! Where are they? Monroe - Where are they? Where is that little bitch and her mother? Monroe, please. Tell me where they are, Michael, or I swear to God, I'm going to snap your neck. Ted's. They're at Ted's. Don't worry, Evelyn, he'll never post bail. Oh... he'll come. You've got us. It'll be all right. No, it won't be all right. You get that lying little whore away from me. She ruined my family. She ruined my life. Evelyn, you don't mean that. Yes, I do! Just get that whore away from me. Oh, honey, let me take you down stairs and show you to your room. I'll be back, but for God's sakes, put that bottle away and consider what your saying to your child. I damn well know what I'm saying. She destroyed our lives. Just an evil little whore! Your mother doesn't mean that, she's just upset. She doesn't know what she's saying. Just an evil little whore. You tell on me! Here, I come to you... Hurry up, Sheryl. Dad, I've literally just got in here. And you about to just get out, it's been 20 minutes. I'll be out in a minute. Geez! I can't even enjoy a shower anymore. You're all going to get what you deserve! All of you. All of you. Everything's going to be okay. There's no way he's going to post bail. I hope you're right. But the things I've learned in the last couple of hours, if they're true... Let's just make sure Claire and Evelyn are taken care of. I put Claire in Lauren's old room across from Sheryl's. I'm going upstairs to talk to Evelyn. How is she? How do you think she would be? I can imagine. No, I don't think you can. Claire. Come here, honey. Everything's going to be okay. Why don't you go back up to the room? Claire! Monroe, what are you doing here? Where is she? I don't know, I haven't see her. Not... her. Tomorrow we'll... What is it, honey? Claire. Where is that little... Monroe, look, you've got to take it easy. Take it easy. Hey, dad, I'm... He's here. Impossible. Stay here, I'll see what's going on. Monroe? Where's Ted? Where's Claire?! I don't know. Where's Ted? Oh my God! Where is she? You mean, your whore? I hate you. I fucking hate you. Where... is Claire? Fuck you. Where is my daughter? Fuck you! Get off of me. Let me be! Get off of me! Come out... I'll be quick. No? Then what I've done to you is nothing compared to what I'm going to do to. Come here. Come here! You're going to burn, you little bitch. I'm going to make sure of that. I'm going to make sure your life's a living hell. Every day, I'm going to be there. Oh, yeah. No. Oh, yeah, because I'll be there... because I ain't never going back to jail. Frank? Hello? Tommy? Kristen? Frank? Frank! Tommy! Kristen! No. No! No! This is impossible. I want out. I need to get out! You can't. You're not real. Am I going crazy? I don't know. I just know you can't get out, not until it's time. When is it time? When it's time. That's not an answer, damn it. You'll know when it's time. How will I know? You just will. It's coming for you. There's nothing you can do. What's coming? It is. It? The evil. It's coming. Do you have a two? Go fish. Do you have any tens? Do you have any aces? How about some threes? He's cheating. There's a mirror just behind you. Tommy Carter! What? You know what happens when you cheat, don't you? You get the tickle claw. Cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater. No! Yes, you do! You do! Yeah, okay. I say we get some ice cream. Ice cream. Ice cream. I scream - You scream - We all scream for ice cream. Come on, kiddos. I'm sorry. The kid's play is tomorrow night. Oh, that's right. Tommy's playing Tiny Tim. And Kristen's playing... The Ghost of Christmas Present. That's right. Aw, our budding thespians. My little one's better not grow up to be thespians. What time's the debacle? I mean the play. Who says it's going to be awful? I do. You don't remember last year? Oh, you do. Yeah... Listen, I love my little ones with all my heart but... I don't think you have to worry about them being full-time thespians. As I recall, you used to act. If you could call it that. You're not real. You can't be. It's too late. Too late for what? It's here. Now. What's here? Come to me, my child. Mommy. Kristen? How did you get here? Kristen! Kristen, please! Kristen, baby, please come back to me! Kristen? Kristen? Kristen? No. You can't be here. I need to show you something. What? Something. Take my hand. No. Then, I can't help you. Wait. Don't leave me here. I don't know what's going on. Wait here. Okay, thank you. Thank you. I want you to get out of the car, and go out into the woods, and if anybody asks what you're doing, you tell them you're going to the restroom. Do you understand me? Yes. And no matter what you hear... you stay there until I come and get you. Understand me? Yes. I asked you, if you understood me? Yes. Good. Now go on. Sweetheart, where are you going? Little girls' room. Well, I can go with her, if you want me to. She'll be fine. Besides, I might need your help. Both of your helps, not as young as I used to be. Claire, go on, honey. She'll be fine. Why don't you show me where that spare tire is, let's get you back on the road. Please! Please, help me! I don't want to die! Please help! Oh, my God! She's dead... She won't ever come back. Don't worry, Claire... I killed her. But, I didn't touch her. You know you're my one and only. But understand something, you tell anybody about this, your momma, anyone... and you're going to end up just like her. Do you understand me? Yes. It's just like that other stuff, something we don't talk about. Why? Why? Why do you have to show me that? So glad you could make it. What is this? Christmas dinner. Please join us. So glad you could make it. All right, all right, I'll sit. Just stop saying that. Carve the turkey, hon. No. We want turkey. You always carve the turkey on Christmas. Why, mommy? Claire. What did I do? Nothing. You've got to talk to me. I'm worried about you, the kids are worried about you. You haven't come out of the bedroom all day. Kids are too afraid to even come in here. Don't say that. Please, talk to me. I keep hearing things, and seeing things. Kind... what kind of things? Things that happened to me as a kid, things that I haven't talked about. I love you, baby. The kids love you. No matter what you tell me, that's not going to change. I just... Please do share, Claire. You're hurting me. I like hurting you. You again. Why are you doing this to me? You're not real. I am real. No, you're not. It's impossible. I'm here to show you things. To help you. You damn well aren't helping me. I am. You just don't know it yet. It's after you. What is It? What do you keep talking about? It is - What, that demon thing? No. Not again. I'm not going to do that again if you're going to show me something awful. You have to. It's the only way to keep it from getting to you. I don't understand. I don't understand what's going on. But you will. I promise. Don't turn around. I just want to come home, Frank. I just want to come home. I know, sweetheart. We got to stay here until they get your medicine right. And then you can come home. I miss the kids. I hate it here. Please, take me out of here. I'll be okay. I'm fine. I feel better already. But we got to wait until the doctors say it's okay. It shouldn't be more than a couple days now. Then things are going to be so much better for you. For all of us. I just want you well. I told you, I want out of here, damn it! Listen to me, get me out of this place! I want to go to my own fucking house! I want to be with you and my fucking kids! Don't you understand? I'm sorry. Oh, god, I'm sorry I didn't mean that. It's okay. I'm sorry. God, I'm sorry. It's okay, baby. A couple more days and everything's going to be fine. What is it? Do you see him again? No. Is he behind me? No, he's not there. I haven't seen him anymore since I've been here. Liar. Okay. Look, I'm going to let you get some rest, okay? I'm going to come back this afternoon. Take me home tonight. Please, Frank. Please, tonight? We'll have to talk to the doctors, okay? I'll talk to them on my way out, and I'll see what he has to say. Okay. Tell him I'm better, okay? Tell him I'm fine now. No more voices, no more visions, okay? I will. Frank? I'm not getting any better. Aw, don't say that. Sure you are. Are you taking your meds? I don't like the way they make me feel. My god, Claire... Don't do that to me. When I take them, it's like I can't feel anymore. It's like I have no emotions, it's like I'm dead inside. When you don't take them... God... I know, I hate it! I hate it! Oh, I hate it. Come on now, you're getting worked up again. It's because you keep telling me what to do. Take your meds - you act like I'm crazy! Don't patronize me. What the hell? I'm so cold. I'm so cold. Please, help me. No. Please. No, no. No. No, no. You're her! You're the reason I'm dead! Leave me alone! Get awayfrom me! I didn't do it, I didn't do it. It wasn't me. It'll be over soon enough, for the both of us. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it. Not much longer. Make it all stop, please. Make it stop. How many time, Tommy? How many times do I have to tell you to keep this room looking straight? And look at it. Claire? Who are you talking to? Tommy! He made an absolute mess all over the bed. Hon, Tommy and Kristen are outside playing. He got crumbs all over the bed. There aren't any crumbs on the bed. The kids are outside. There were crumbs. He's not here! He's not here! Claire, he's not here. Look at me, look at me, Look at me, who do you see? Who do you see? You. Me. You see me - I see you. I see you. Yes, he's not here. There's no one else... No, damn it! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Damn it, look at me! Look at me! It's just me. There's no one else. It's just me, Frank. Just you and only you. Do you understand? Yeah. Okay. I'm going to call - I'm going to call the doctor, okay? But you need to sit here while I go get my phone, all right? Okay. I'll be back in 20 seconds. Okay? Okay. Okay? Oh, god! No! No! Look at me! Wait, don't leave me! I don't want to. You little whore. Momma! Please, help me! Please, help me! Your momma - that whore lives in the bottom of a bottle. You... you please me. I can't! Please. Turn over. Or I'm going to beat you until you can't move. No, I can't, I don't want to! I don't care what you want! It's what I want. And you're going to get what you need. No! Don't you lay a hand on her! Don't you dare! Look who it is. I told you, you'd never escape me. She didn't do anything to you. Oh, but she did... she pleases me in so many ways. Don't you touch her. Or what? What are you going to do? Stop me? You never could stop me. Why don't you run to your momma? You know where she is. Maybe that bitch will help you. I don't want to! I wondered when you were going to come stumbling in here. Momma? You couldn't let the dead rest in peace, could you? You're drunk. And you're a wicked slut of a daughter. How can you say that? How can you sit here, while that's going on in the next room? You wanted it. You wanted him all to yourself. That's not true. He forced himself on me. Having him all to yourself wasn't enough, huh? You had to go and fuck him too. He won't even look at me anymore. What kind of a mother are you? He raped me. He ripped my childhood away from me. Don't play me. You were always just a little whore. Parading around in those pajamas, shaking that little whore's ass of yours. You never said anything. You never did anything. You never tried to stop him, you did nothing! You're just a dirty, little whore. Why didn't you protect me? I hated you. You ruined my life. You let him do those things to me. You and the others. You took everything from me. I was nine years old. I was innocent. You... were never innocent. You were never sober enough to noticed the difference. Shut up. You let my father rape me! Shut up! And you did nothing about it! Shut that little trap of yours! Or what? You'll do what you did while he was raping me? I'm going to do what I should have done a long time ago. You hated me. You hated me! You let him rape me! Daddy's little girl. You didn't make the evil. It's not your fault. You just brought it here. How? How did I do that? If I take your hand again, is it going to help me understand what's going on? Yes. Is it going to hurt as bad this time? Yes, worse. Worse than before. But not as bad as it's going to be. You stay here - Claire, honey, you need to tell us. Ms. Dansbury here says you've been telling her all kinds of things. Things about your dad? Are these things you've been saying about him, true? Or are you just making them up? You said you saw bruises on her arms? Yes, I did. Are those bruises from your daddy? Claire, honey, look at me. You know me, right? And you know I'm here to help, right? Okay. What you may not know, as your principal, I'm also here to protect you. And if someone out there is hurting you, I can make them stop. And they will never be able to hurt you ever again, okay? But I have to know if these things are true, you understand? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Tell me now, is someone hurting you? You can tell me. I will take care of you. And I will make it stop, I promise. Is that a yes? Okay, sweetie. Your mother, does she know? Does your mother know anything about this? No. Only him. Okay, listen, sweetie, this is very, very important, you have to tell me, what does he do to you? He... Does he beat you on your bottom? Or anywhere else? Does he hit you anywhere? On my bottom... and other places. Okay, what else does he do to you? Does he touch you anywhere he shouldn't? Do anything else to you, he shouldn't? Jill, get me Sheriff Moody on the phone right now. You just had to go and open your fucking mouth, didn't you? You just had to tell somebody? You've done it now. You fucked it all up. This is all your fault, you little bitch. He's going to come after us. He's going to come after us and kill us. Or worse... Was it so bad? Huh, was it? Just lay there and take it, that's what I told you. Just lay there and take it. But no... you had to run off and open your fucking mouth and tell someone. He told you what he would do, didn't he - If you ever told anybody? You think he won't? No, he's going to come after us. And he's going to kill us. If he can find us. Where is that little bitch and her mother? Monroe, please. Tell me where they are, Michael. Or I swear to God, I'm going to snap your neck. Ted's. They're at Ted's. Here, let's get you upstairs. Ted, you got this down here? Sure. I'll be up to check on you in a minute. If he finds us here, it'll be bad. It's okay, Evelyn, they won't let him go. We'll sort out what to do tomorrow. Claire? Here, have a seat for a minute. You like jokes? What's black and white, and red all over? Newspaper. You heard this joke before? Hmm. You go. What's black and white, and red all over, and it's not a newspaper? Hmm, I don't know. A sunburned penguin. Good one. Shh, it'll hear us and find us. Quick, under here. Hurry, he'll find us. What is It? The evil. It's coming for them. What do you mean? Shh, it'll hear us. Don't let it get me. I thought it had us. You're going nowhere. Go away! No, no! No! No! This is all your fault! You can't get away with it! It got her, now It's going to get you! No! No! What? What is this? Do you feel cold inside? No. Yes. You took them. They belong to me now. Oh, yes, their souls belong to me. My babies. Not your babies anymore, they're mine. Their souls are mine. Don't you hurt them, don't you dare touch them. Stop, stop it! I'm going to collect her soul. No, don't! Or what? Please, I'll do anything! Anything you want! Just don't hurt them. Please. I hardly think that's true. What are you? I'm you. I'm your sadder side, I'm the part that resides in the darkest recesses of your soul, the part that you pretend doesn't exist. I am the great unwashed, I am the savior of those who suffer the trappings of deluded misdeeds, you want to know who I am? I am your pain. Claire? Monroe, what... what are you doing here? Where is she? I don't know, I haven't seen Evelyn. Not her, Claire. Where is that little bitch? Monroe, you need to just calm down. Calm down. Dad, I was just... Monroe! Where is Ted? Where is Claire? Where is Ted? Oh my God! I hate you. Come here. You're going to burn, you little bitch. I'm going to make sure of that. I'm going to make sure your life is a living hell. I'm going to be there. Every day, oh yeah, oh yeah. Because I ain't never going back to jail! Where are you going, Claire? Where is she? Where are my kids? What have you done with them? You can't escape me, Claire. I've got them. And now I'm here for you. No place to run, Claire. Besides, where ever you go, there you are. This is not real. This not real! This is not happening! This is not real. Little pig, little pig... let me come in. You! You let the evil into our house. I didn'tmean to. And now, I'm cold. So cold. I'm sorry. Sorry? Do you know what the pain is like? It's like being turned inside out and your brain is on fire. You deserve to be here, burning with us, dying with us. Now you can see my true face. Claire. Leave her alone. You're not real, you're just in my mind. Really? Is that what you think? Then what happens to her... really won't matter, now will it? And you were there facing me last. There it is. Fuck you, you bastard. Look at your hand. You can't escape. You're not real. Can you not smell the stench of your past? Get away from me. Your soul is black and diseased. Give into me. I'll kill you. You can't escape. You know that! Embrace me now. Stay away! Put down the wrench. Fuck you! Claire! Stay away! Claire! Get away from me! Stop swinging the fucking wrench. You can't kill me, Claire. No! Where are you? Give into me, Claire. Besides, I'm not in front of you... I'm behind you. Boo! Mommy? Kristen! Tommy! I can't move, Mommy. Don't you hurt them. They are such precious children, aren't they? Please, don't hurt them! Then submit to me. Get on your knees. What? Do it. And see what happens. Good. Now take the knife... and kill yourself. What? Kill yourself. No! No, you son of a bitch! Ah! Claire! Claire Morris? Claire Morris. Who is it? It's the Sheriff's Department. Yes, just a minute. Are you Miss Morris? Yes, what is this? Please, keep your hands where I can see them and come out of the tent. Show your hands now! Come out of the tent. Wait, what's wrong? What... no... hey, what are you doing? Hold still, ma'am. Just hold still. What's happening? I haven't done anything. I'm not... I'm not going anywhere with you, until you tell me what's going on. Just hold still. I haven't done anything. Stop! No! Hey, no, tell me what we're doing. No! I haven't done anything. Come on! Wait a minute! Where are we going? Tell me what is going on. No! No. Stop! Wait! What's going on? What's wrong? What's happening? I have to show you. No. I love you, Frank. I love you too. What's wrong? I love you, too. He'll never get you. He'll never hurt you. I'll never let that happen. I love you. I'll never let him get you. Never. No, my babies! No! No! No! No! I love them, you don't understand. I saved them. I saved them. I love them, I love them. I... I love them. I saved them. I saved them. I love them. I love them... I saved them. I saved them. I love them. Shh. We love them too. We all love them. We love them. We saved them. We love them. We saved them. We saved them.
