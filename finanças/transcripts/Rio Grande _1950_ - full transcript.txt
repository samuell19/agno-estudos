Yay! They're coming! They're coming! Sick call! Corpsman! "A" troop. Forward right. Yo-ho! Forward right. Yo-ho! Troop, halt! Halt! Gentlemen, congratulations. Thank you, sir. Indian scouts... yuh-te. Yuh-te! When you're dismissed... you will walk your horses for half an hour... then water and picket them. The sutler's store will remain open until twelve o'clock. Let them have some beer. We thank the Colonel. That's a fine idea. Officers post. Gallop. Prepare to dismount! Dismount! To the left, parade out! Good evening. Good evening, sir. Good evening, sir. Have a cup of your own coffee, York? I've been thinking of nothing else... for the last two hours. Tough, huh? Tough, sir. I haven't had a cup of duty coffee with you... since we rode down the Shenandoah together. Fifteen years ago, wasn't it? Fifteen years, two months... seven days. How did you fare on patrol? Had a running fight for 30-odd miles. We captured Natchez, their chief... eight others before the Apaches reached the Rio Grande... and crossed into Mexico. Pursuant to orders... I halted on our side of the river. Men didn't like it very much. Neither did you. And neither do I, but that's the policy... and soldiers don't make policy. They merely carry it out. The State Department could do something. Oh, yes. They'll write a sharp note of protest... if you care to read sharp notes of protest. I'll declaim them over the graves of the troopers... who were guarding the water holes. Three of them staked face down on anthills. You've got the dirtiest job in the army. There's no doubt of that, Kirby. I'm not complaining, sir. I get paid for it. Maybe you should complain. I'll listen. This coffee isn't as good as it used to be. I'll make a note of that. But maybe, someday it'll get better and stronger. I'll drink to that, sir. Stronger. Too bad about your son. I hadn't heard. Oh, I'm sorry, Kirby. I thought you knew. He failed mathematics at West Point... and they've dropped him from the military academy. Indeed. Oh, it's no disgrace failing mathematics. I just missed it myself by the skin of my teeth. I haven't seen my son in 15 years. Yes, I know. It's... Well, Kirby, this coffee is weak, but it's all we have. More? If it's all we have. ♪ You're in the Army now ♪ ♪ You're not behind a plow ♪ ♪ You'll never get rich by digging a ditch ♪ ♪ You're in the Army now ♪ - Column, by the left.

But in no time at all, you'll be soldiers. Sure. Why, in less than six months... with good behavior and hard work... you'll be wearing yellow stripes on your britches. Would you mind be putting your cap back on your head, son? No, not at all, Doc. Did any of youse ever ride a horse? Yeah, some.

All right. Pick up your bags. Left face! As you were, Sergeant. I don't want you men to be fooled about what's coming up for you... torture. At least that. The War Department promised me 180 men. They sent me 18, all told. You are the 18. So each one of you will have to do the work of 10 men. If you fail, I'll... have you spread-eagled on a wagon wheel. If you desert, you'll be found... tracked down and broken into bits. That is all. Forward. Hey! Hut, two, three, four. Hut, two, three, four. Trooper Yorke, sir. I haven't seen you for 15 years. So I've been told, sir. I have no clear memory. You proved that when you failed at West Point. Yes, sir. Where did you enlist? At Highland Falls, sir. Next day. Lied about your age. Recruit training? Jefferson Barracks, sir. Hmm. On the official records, you're my son. But on this post, you're just another trooper. You heard me tell the recruits what I need from them. Twice that I will expect from you. At Chapultepec... my father, your grandfather... shot for cowardice the son of a United States senator. That was his duty. I will do mine. You've chosen my way of life. I hope you have the guts to endure it. But put out of your mind... any romantic ideas that it's a way of glory. It's a life of suffering and of hardship... an uncompromising devotion to your oath and your duty. Have I the colonel's permission to speak? Within proper limits, yes. I didn't ask to come to this regiment, sir... but I wouldn't have it otherwise now that I'm here. May I also put something straight? Proceed. I'm not in this post to call you Father. I was ordered here as Trooper Jefferson Yorke... of the United States Cavalry. And that's all I wish to be, sir. Then we understand each other. We do, sir. Sergeant Major? The recruits are for field duty, as of now. Dismissed. Trooper Yorke. What are you waiting for? Trooper Yorke expects his salute to be returned. Military regulations, sir. Quincannon. Can't you go around faster? Keep your heads down! That's it! Hey, hey! Keep it coming now! You got it made! There we go! Once again and faster! Put it up another notch. Give 'em a good jump. Now, you see how easy it is? Why, when I was a young man like yourselves... I could jump nine feet tall... and with an Indian under each arm. What tribe? Once again and faster! Horsemen. Ha ha! Yaah! Appears to me they make a lot of fuss... jumping a horse over some sticks. Yo. That's a six-foot jump, Travis. Now, give them their heads. Now over! There, you see? That gives you an idea what horsemanship is like... in the United States Cavalry. Now, after that comes the Roman teams. Now that's easy. It's the way the Romans used to ride. The ancient Romans. Standing up. Standing up. Yo. Slim! Upsy-daisy! Mister, what time do you blow the horn around here... for folks to eat? You think you'd like to try that before you eat? You mean, ride like them ancient Romans? Yes. Yo! Let's go, Sandy! Hyah! Hyah! Come on, Sandy! Easy, now! Easy! Yay! Yay! Thatta boy! Horsemen. Oh, boy-o, horsemen. Nice team, Corporal. That the general idea, Doc? That's the general idea... but before I'm through with youse... you'll be taking them jumps backwards. Now, is there another man... The marshal wants to make a routine check. He thinks perhaps this man might be among our new recruits. Got anybody the name of Tyree among your horse thieves? Horse thieves, is it now? That's what I said. And they're all men wearing the uniform... of the United States Cavalry. Fella I'm lookng for is from Texas... wanted for questioning about a killing. Is there a man from Texas among youse? Yes, sir. I'm from Texas. Name of Boone. Daniel Boone. Daniel Boone? That name's kinda familiar, ain't it, Mink? Name's Tyree. A $50 reward. Right tidy sum. Tyree. Nobody here by that name. Sergeant, be taking the Marshals to sutlers, will you? - Give them a wee drop of comfort. - Sure, Marshal. Who's gonna pay for that liquor? The Sergeant will pay for it. Heh. Horse thieves we don't have here... but horsemen I'll make of youse yet. Yo. Is there anyone else who'd like to be trying the jumps... after the manner of the ancient Romans? Yes, sir, I would. Get it done, Johnny Reb. Get up on 'em! You'll get busted for this, Quincannon. Get your hat. You all right, boy? Yeah, I'm all right. Now, curry them well and cool them off, men! In six months, we'll have the finest drill team in the world. Come here, Jeff. Get in there. Let them fight! - Come on! - Hey, cool it off there! Break it up! Break it up! What are you guys doing? Break it up! Break it up! Come on, break it up! Break it up, I tell you! Let them fight. Now, what started this fight? I refuse to answer, sir. Go ahead. Tell him, Reb. This fella here spoke real derogatory about the boy's pappy. He also said he was the teacher's pet... of a chowder-headed Mick sergeant. What's that mean, Doc? Did you say that? Yes, I did. You did, did you? Yes, I did. Did you mean it, did you? Yes, I did. We'll settle this tonight... behind the picket line, soldier-fashion. Marquis of Queensberry rules. Shouted face chow... What was it he said? Chowder-headed Mick sergeant. Chowdered-headed Mick... And you meant it, did you? Yes, I did. Nine o'clock tonight, boys! Get it done, Johnny Reb. That a boy, Jeff! Keep your left up! Come on. Put him up. Put some water on him. You're winning, boy, just like a mountain lion. You're doin' real good, Jeff, boy, but don't forget to keep your left up. Twist it like this. Keep your left in his face, Jeff. You're doing good. You'll get busted for this, Quincannon. You're doin' all right, sonny, but use that right. Keep throwing that right in there. Like that. Hit him with the right. It's a lovely fight, Heinze, but watch them fouls. None of that, none of that, see? And when you come out of the clinches, none of that. Attention! Well, Quincannon, talk fast. Soldiers' fight, sir. What caused it? I refuse to answer. Respectfully, sir. Heinze? I refuse to answer, sir. Yorke? No, sir. Soldiers' fight, eh? Carry on. You heard what the colonel said. Carry on with the fight. Thanks, Heinze. I'm sorry, soldier. I apologize. Now, sonny, let me have a look at that eye. You're going to be all right. Just sit right down. You little rascal. It's the left you should have been watching. The left. The left like that. Good morning, sonny. Why, that's castor oil. Supply train 2 hours and 20 minutes late. Whoa. That's the colonel's quarters over there, ma'am. Well, Trunkett, when did you take unto yourself a wife? I ain't yet. Beggin' your pardon, ma'am... but unauthorized ladies are not permitted on this post. I am not unauthorized. I am Trooper Jefferson Yorke's mother. I... I'm afraid we have no accommodations... no quarters for mothers of the enlisted men. I have a pass signed by General Sheridan. May I help you, ma'am? I'll handle this, Captain. Thank you, sir. Good evening, Kathleen. Good evening, Kirby. Sergeant. Yes, sir? See that Mrs. Yorke's bags are unloaded... and taken to my quarters. Yes, sir. Welcome home, darlin'. I see you still have that arsonist with you. You mean Quincannon? He is a sergeant major in the United States Army. Anything he may have done long ago in the line of duty... he did in obedience to my orders. Reluctantly, I may add. Oh. The reluctant arsonist. I suppose the safest way for us to start our conversation... would be for you to just say... "To what do I owe the honor of your visit?" I saw the reason for your visit this morning. How is he? He's grown considerably, I thought. Right now, he's bruised up a little. Had a fight. Not much. A fight? With another soldier. Hardly an officer. Hardly with an officer? He's not gentleman enough for that. You said the world soldier. That's enough for me. Not for me. Jeff was boyishly ashamed when he was expelled from West Point. He shouldn't have enlisted. I could have sent him to Lexington. He could have tutored in mathematics... and then got his commission. But he did enlist, and he's here. And here he'll stay, and here he'll serve. Ramrod, wreckage, and ruin. Still the same Kirby. Special privilege to special born. Still the same Kathleen. Kirby, I've come to take Jeff home. He signed enlistment papers. He took an oath. Oath. Jeff can be released from the Army... bought off honorably for the sum of $100. I brought that amount with me, in Yankee gold. You forget one very important detail, Kathleen. Such a release requires my signature as commanding officer. You've overlooked several other important details. Number one... you're a fine figure of a woman. Number two... you probably haven't eaten.

What kind of man is he, mother? He's a lonely man. He's a very lonely man. They say he's a great soldier. I suppose he is, but... what makes soldiers great is hateful to me. I've come to take you home, Jeff. I can't leave, mother. It'd be quitting. You're stubborn and proud, Jeff... just like he is. Just like you are, Mother. I'll buy you out. No! I failed at West Point. I'm gonna work this out my own way. I'll take you home... as soon as your father signs your papers. Maybe they didn't tell you, Mother... but the application requires my signature, too. I refuse to sign it. I'd like to... Ah, them blasted coyotes. What coyotes, sir? Them ain't coyotes, sir. And how long have you been out west? Long enough to know a coyote when I hear it, sir.

This means real trouble, gentlemen... unless we can stop them before they cross the Rio Grande. Captain St. Jacques, you will form troop "A". Two bandoleers of ammunition per trooper. Four days' rations. Is that clear? Yes, sir. - Sergeant! - Yes, sir. Ready to move out in 30 minutes. I suppose I'm under arrest... for being out of bounds, as you call it. No, but we can't have the colonel's lady fainting... every time there's a little shooting. Kirby. I'll take them. Thank you. Attention! Column of twos, Captain. Ride by twos. Trot! Yo!

Well, I generally let one of the other ladies do my things... but I'm sure the Sergeant here... would like to give you his trade. As a doctor... I would diagnose those as saddle sores. Trooper Tyree. Here, sir. I have a demand from the Deputy United States Marshal... to seize you under warrant... issued by due and legal process by the District Court... "Fernando X. Hernandez, Judge... "on charges of manslaughter." The way that language sounds, I must be arrested. As the commanding officer is not present... you will await his signature to take your prisoner. Got any place I can lock this soldier boy up... till I get them papers signed? With a fella like this, sir, I mean, a desperado... why don't you leave him at the hospital? It's a good idea. I'll get my feet checked. They've been bothering me. You wanna come along peaceful-like... or you want me to use these cuffs on you? I'm always peaceful, Marshal. And there ain't no use doing nothin' else. Excuse me, ma'am. Are you arresting that nice young man for manslaughter? Not me, Mrs. Yorke. The United States Deputy Marshal. Manslaughter. Well, what are you going to do about it? A nice gentle soul who'd walk 10 miles out of his way... before he'd step on an ant. You go to the hospital. Get him some tobacco, anything he wants. And we'll also get him a lawyer to defend him. - He's partial to molasses candy. - Yo. Well, get some. Yankee justice. Arresting a nice young man like that for manslaughter... and promoting arsonists to be sergeant majors! Uncle Timmy!

I have got spots in front of me eyes... and me heart is palpitating, and I'm... Sitting on it. Thank you, Doctor. Ahh. I feel better now. It'll kill you or cure you. Doctor... with your fine education, would you be telling me something? Yeah. What is an arsonist? An arsonist is a person that sets buildings on fire for profit or perverse excitement. Oh, is that what it is? Why? It all started when we rode down the Shenandoah Valley, Doctor. Every trooper of General Sheridan's command... during the late war. It was me cursed luck... to be ordered to burn the crops and the barns at Bridesdale... with herself looking daggers at me... and sables at the Colonel. He was the captain then. Silent as death she was, with a baby in her arms... little Jeff. Little Jeff! Well, it was grim duty for both you and the Colonel. That was his wife's plantation, wasn't it? Aye. She said it was owned by the same family... ever since that grand Irishman, Sir Walter Raleigh... first smoked a pipe. Seems like I've heard that story before. And there's the black hand that did the dirty deed! I wish you'd knock it off with that stick! Troop, halt! I make it out to be a Mexican officer... approaching to meet you, sir. Cool off and water your horses. Bugler... honors, please. Three flourishes. Welcome to Rio Bravo. Buenas tardes, el teniente. And my respect, Senor Colonel Yorke. Wish I'd reached the Rio Grande half an hour sooner. I wish the same, Senor Colonel. It would have saved me three brave men killed... and two wounded. Have you medical aid for your wounded? Unfortunately, no. Tell the surgeon's striker... to bring up the pack mule, cross the Rio Grande... with your permission, Lieutenant... I grant it with gratitude, Senor Colonel. And attend our wounded comrades... on the Rio Bravo side. I would suggest, Lieutenant. Yes, Senor Colonel? Natchez and his band are a scourge... to both your country and mine. We can catch them now... before they reach their mountain stronghold. I would gladly place myself and my men... under your command, Lieutenant... if you would invite us to join you in pursuit. Unfortunately, Senor Colonel... my orders are firm. I must, above all, protect the Rio Bravo. With three men, sir? That's courage. And my orders are firm, also. I must stay on the Rio Grande side.

It would be a start if you'd let Jeff go. And get you back. If that were a condition. I could say yes to you very easily, Kathleen... but I owe Jeff something. He's a fine boy. But he must learn that a man's word to anything... even his own destruction... must be honored. Good evening, Yorke. Good evening, sir. How about a cup of coffee? General... to your very good health, sir. To the President of the United States. Perhaps Mrs. Yorke will favor us with a sentiment. To my only rival... The United States Cavalry. Sir... the traditional singers would like to sing... The regimental singers. That's just what I was going to say, sir.

Hey, son, do you know that man has a warrant... charging you with manslaughter? A lot of people use that word "manslaughter" pretty freely. Boy, why don't you tell us about this? Maybe we can help you. Well, it could be... that a fella had a run-in with a Yankee down in Texas. Somethin' about the fella's... sister. And it could be that the Yankee... drawed a gun and started shootin'. Got himself killed. Mrs. Yorke wants to get you a lawyer... to get you out of this scrape. Thank her kindly for me, and tell her... Look, fellas... my sister's gettin' married to a man she grew up with... a Texican. Fine fella. They kinda plan on goin' to California and startin' fresh. And I don't think it's quite right... to start a lot of talk and scandal in open court... until their dust is settled behind them. Well, it makes sense to me. Of course, when I hear they're in California... I'll be wantin' that lawyer, wantin' him bad. To tell you the truth, I kinda like this man's Army. Thank you for your kindness, Doctor. Yeah. Let's get her done, Sergeant. If that boy was one of my troopers... I wouldn't be so eager to see him get hung. I'll just take a little sup for me cold. And when I'm finished with it...

Dallas lawyer can't get a man... off a charge of manslaughter... Halt! Who's there? Hey! Corporal of the guard! My horse. Yes, sir. I sacrificed the happiness of your home once, Kirby... to the needs of war. Now I'll probably ruin your army career. I'm gonna issue an order and give it to you personally. I want you to cross the Rio Grande... hit the Apache, and burn 'em out. I'm tired of hit-and-run. I'm sick of diplomatic hide-and-seek. Strip the camp of all women and children. Send them to Fort Bliss. Be prepared to remain all winter. All next winter, if necessary. I've waited a long time for that order, sir... which, of course, I didn't hear. Of course, you didn't hear. If you fail... I assure you, the members of your court-martial... will be the men who rode with us down the Shenandoah. I'll hand-pick 'em myself. Shenandoah. I wonder what history will say about Shenandoah. I can tell you what my wife said about it. What seems to be the trouble there, Kirby? Shenandoah Valley... a place called Bridesdale... and Philip H. Sheridan. How about a cup of coffee, sir? Yeah. Yeah, sure. You'll find it stronger. You look very elegant, sir. Ahem. Gentlemen... with the regiment leaving... for a winter campaign in the morning... and the women and children being sent to Fort Bliss... I am sure you have many arduous and difficult tasks to perform. Please do not let me keep you from them. Thank you for the coffee, madame. You're welcome. You're very kind, Mrs. Yorke. Thank you. You do look very elegant, Kirby. What I said about the women and children is true. You're leaving in the morning for Fort Bliss. Jeff is going with you. He'll be one of the escorts. He'll hate it, Kirby. He'll think that... He's my son, our son. He's too young to... He'll still hate it, Kirby. But I love you for it. I cleaned and ironed your uniform. Well, it's a good job. I'd like to get my hands on this white jacket sometime. That'll cost you 4 bits, as they say out here. 4 bits, huh? Uh-huh. 10 dollars? I... Kathleen, that was meant for us. There's your change, Kirby. Been carrying that around for a long time... hoping someday that poor little... I'll take the flowers now. Well, I... Aren't you going to kiss me goodbye? I never wanna kiss you goodbye, Kathleen. Well, here we are, children. You're all going on the choo-choo. Come here. There you are. There, now. There we go. Ready, Mr. Markham? Ready, sir. Carry on. Goodbye, Mrs. Yorke. I'm very glad to have met you. Upsy-daisy. Uncle Timmy, you're going to be a good boy now, aren't you? Ah, darlin', darlin'. By your leave, sir. By your leave, sir. You'll be careful, Trunkett. Yes, sir. Prepare to mount! Mount! I got this from the Paymaster. That's sweet of you, honey. I'll write you at Fort Bliss. Be sure not to forget. I won't forget. Wagons and escorts, lead out. Forward, yo! Hey, Travis. I thought you'd show up. Where's your canteen, Sandy? This one's dry. We'll have to report you to the Sergeant for being late. Bein' as I'm already on all the reports that is... that ain't worryin' me none. Ahh. I'm hungry. Beans? Nobody ever told the Army they grow beef round this part of the country? Not lately. We'll be on cold rations for three days. One of you better ride up ahead and tell the Lieutenant... that water hole I come by down there this morning is all muddied up. Heap big Injun sign. We'd better get going. Thank your pappy for the loan of his horse. You thank him. Hey, hey! I got you! Jump on! Giddyap! Hyah! Heinze, come on! Uncle Timmy! Uncle Timmy!

Yes, sir. Vengeance dance. They'll dance until dawn and then... Where are the children held? In an old church, sir. Is it dark enough for you to get in there? With two men I pick, sir. Two men you pick? I know that you are an excellent judge of horse flesh... Trooper Tyree. Proved that when you stole my horse. How are you as a judge of men for a dangerous mission? I consider myself a good judge of the men I trust, sir. That's a good answer. Call your volunteers. Sandy! Jeff! Troopers Boone, Yorke. - Yo. - Yo. Take my horse. Good swimmer. Get it done, boy. Thank you, sir. Sandy. Are you scared? Me? Yo. Troop, halt. Pass the word. Dismount. Pass the word. Dismount. Forward, by trooper. Oh, Sandy! I'm sorry. I thought you were an Indian. Shh. Be quiet, Margaret Mary. - Hi, Jeff! - Shh! Thanks very much. Shh! Listen, honey. Where are the children? They're over there, asleep. You're gonna have to be a brave girl... 'cause there's gonna be lots of shootin'. - Oh, goody! - Shh! Shh! You youngsters, be quiet. I can't figure out which side that kid's on... them or ours. Let's go, Alamo! Margaret Mary!
