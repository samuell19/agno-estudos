achievement in film fittingly the first recipient of that award was sessile B DeMille tonight 66 years later the Hollywood Foreign Press has created a second award that celebrates lifetime achievement in television it is my great honor to recognize the very first recipient of the Carol Burnett Award and the nominees are Christian Bale Charlize Theron Antonio Banderas and Carol Burnett and the winner you know what you know what I I hate to root for one nominee over the others but I really think that Carol Burnett should win this and I will tell you why first of all she's a comedy legend she is the most decorated court person of all time in the Golden Globes television category the first woman to win both the Mark Twain prize for American humor and the Kennedy Center Honor she was the first woman to host a variety sketch show on TV the Carol Burnett Show which ran for 11 years averaged 30 million viewers a week received 25 Emmy Awards and half a century later remains the gold standard for television comedy but beyond that Carol Burnett lives up to every expectation of who you hope Carol Burnett would be she is funny and gracious and kind she is without a doubt one of the most revered respected and well-liked people in show business it's been said that she makes Tom Hanks I didn't say it but it has been said let's take a glimpse at her extraordinary career now at long last I can say the two words that add up to fabulous entertainment Carol Burnett Carol [Music] [Applause] air is a mess did I ever go to acting school uh yes I did I took acting it UCLA and then I

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh Steve Carrell ah all I can say is he is as nice as he is talented and I thank you so much work thank you Steve thank you my thanks to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association I kind of really got smacked by this eye does this mean I get to accept it every year but you know my first love growing up was the movies I'd see as many as six to eight films a week with my grandmother who raised me and then later when I was a teenager we got our first television set and then I had a new love but regardless of the medium what fascinated me was the way the stars on the screen could make people laugh or cry or sometimes both and I wished and I hoped that maybe just maybe someday I could have the chance to do the same thing well those childhood dreams came true sometimes on the big screen but primarily on television on a comedy variety show that half a century later still connects with people in a way that makes me very proud you know sometimes I catch myself daydreaming about being young again and doing it all over and then I bring myself up short when I realize how incredibly fortunate I was to be there at the right time because what we did then it couldn't be done today the cost alone would be prohibitive 28-piece live orchestra no synthesizers 12 dancers average of 65 costumes a week and there was a brilliance of our regular rep players Harvey Korman Vicki Lourdes Lyle Waggoner Jim fine way plus two guest stars every week that's how I'm so grateful for the chemistry that we had with each other and there was great chemistry behind the camera too with our crew our producer our director our choreographer our writers the cue card guys we all became one happy family 4:11 joy-filled years and nothing like our show and I might add other variety shows at the time could ever be see the light of day today because the network's they just wouldn't spend the money and because there are so many cable competitors they're not going to take a chance and sad to say today's audiences might never know what they're missing so here's to reruns and YouTube but what has remained the same for every person who is lucky enough to be on television is the belief that we've been given an opportunity to do something special we've been granted a gift a canvas to paint with our talent one that can make people laugh or cry or maybe do both so this award oh my gosh so generously named after me is dedicated to all those who made my dreams come true and to all those out there who share the love I have for television and who yearn to be part of this unique medium that has been so good to me I'm just happy that our show happened when it did and that I can look back and say once more I am so glad we had this time together [Applause] [Music] now from the series turn up Charlie in Rosella and his cats co-star the global superstar with the biggest US tour in history

Bucky fuller and Bucky he's most he's most famous for the geodesic dome but he made a great observation about these ocean-going tankers and he noticed that the engineers who were particularly a challenged by how to turn this thing you know they got this big rudder it took too much energy to turn the rudder to turn the ship so they came up with a brilliant idea let's put a little runner on the big rudder the little rudder will turn the you know the big rudder the big runner will turn this shit that little rudder is called a trim tab and Bucky made the analogy that that that trim tab is an example of how the individual is connected to society and how we affect society and I think I like to think of myself as a trim tab and all of us are trim tabs we may seem like you know we're not up to the task but we are man we're alive we could we can really we can make a difference we can turn this we can turn this ship and you want to go man towards love creating a healthy planet for all

the pre Civil Rights era of 1960 Don Charlie was a great man and an underappreciated genius who couldn't play the music he wanted to play simply because of the color of his skin yet he went on to create his own genre of music a sound so beautiful that it still resonates today Tony vowel Anka came from an immigrant family in the Bronx and from a culture that didn't value diversity or individuality yet during that trip with dr. Shirlee he grew and evolved more than most families do over several generations this story when I heard it gave me hope and I wanted to share that hope with you because we're still living in divided times maybe more so than ever and that's who this movie's for it's for everybody if Don Charlie and Tony valhalla can find common ground we all can all we have to do all we have to do is talk and to not judge people by their differences but look for what we have in common and we have a lot in common we all want the same thing we want love we want happiness we want to be treated equally and that's not such a bad thing thank you very much I appreciate it coming up which movie will take the big award of the nights we're gonna find out that Golden Globes right here on NBC fall at Golden Globes on
