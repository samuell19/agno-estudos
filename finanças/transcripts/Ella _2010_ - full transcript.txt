I was about to leave Carlos Didn't Luna tell you I was here this morning? No. Look, Carlos, I really haven't got time now I know, I know... but you realize we're out of time The promoters are on to me day and night. They're going crazy.

Well, the day after tomorrow I'm sending the truck round from the gallery to pick up the pieces I'll leave you to get on. OK, OK. Look, I've got to go. I've got a ton of stuff to do. I think she's nice No surprise there You got the wrong coffee again... it's the green box Where are you going?

Oh, go on You tell me one. Why didn't we go to Vanessa's do? Oh, Luna... What? Nothing, nothing... I thought you liked her, that's all... "MISSED CALL" Baby, how'd it go? There's a problem. We have to wait a bit. 1 new message from Everything OK? "All good. Don't worry" I need to get these films developed, please ... Don Alfredo, it must be 7 years since you were last here... Luna's always dropping by. She's one of my best to customers... You know what? No one gets films developed any more. Everyone's got a digital camera and a computer these days. It's taken the soul out of it, don't you think? Yes, yes... it's a shame. Business is bad. 30 years in the trade and things are going from bad to worse. - Sir... - My wife says, "Be patient, business will pick up." But it doesn't, it keeps getting worse. - Sir! Look, I'm in a bit of a hurry. Is this for Lunita? Yes, they're Luna's She usually comes herself... All right then, I'll do them the way she likes: Heavy on the contrast and light on the greys, OK? When will they be ready? This time tomorrow? That's no good. Can't you do them in an hour? No. Luna won't like it if I do them in one hour... We need to see them. It's urgent. Well, I could run up some preliminary prints... and... Great. I'll be back in an hour. "Mayte's birthday tomorrow... please be there... she'll be gutted if you don't go..." "lll try. Let you know" "Around 10. You are weird. Everything OK? "See you tomorrow, cafe de la paz around 12". Hello Good morning, I'd like to speak to Ms. Luna Zavala, please. Luna, it's for you. Sir? Hello? Luna she's... she's not here. I see. Well, we're calling from her work. She's supposed to teach a class but hasn't showed up. We hadn't heard from her... Hello? Her father's had to go into hospital. Oh, we had no idea. I'm sorry. Is it serious? Hello Luna doesn't feel well. She'll be back at work in a few days. Yes, of course. Well, please tell her we hope he gets better soon and to give us a couple of days notice so we can arrange things with the substitute. OK The green ones are marzipan That'll be 97 soles. The chocolates too? No, no. A pack of Marlboro reds and 10 bags of ice. Having a party, eh? How much is it? "Where are you? Anything wrong? Please call... I'm worried" "Lu, need to see you... call me" Hi, what can I get you? Vodka With ice? Yeah. Where's Luna? Get in. Where is she? Where are we going? My place. Where is she? Luna? Lu? Luna? Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Open the door! Open the fucking door! Open it! Shit! For fuck's sake open the door! Fuck! What the fuck have you done? Let me out! I hope you rot in jail I need to understand You're dead, you sonofabitch Let me out please. Is that what you're wearing? No, I'm going to change. Stop it! Come on, stop Let me out. Please I want to get out Please I want to get out She fell... If only I hadn't gone into the bathroom just then. If only I'd stayed in the studio a minute longer. If only she'd made me that coffee Two seconds If only I'd stumbled as I was coming out, if only the phone had rung... When? How long? About six months... She... was my life No, your work was your life... didn't you realize she hated it? She didn't hate it. She spent her life like an object, like material to be used. You don't know what you're talking about ... She couldn't stand you. She couldn't stand your voice, your smell, your jokes, She was sick of you, and you didn't realize it... Come on, honey, stop filming me. You're always filming me You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen Come here. Why don't you come over here with me? What for? There's only one way to find out... What are you doing here? What are you going to do? Nothing... I thought you'd left Where was I supposed to go? To the police, home... I don't know, anywhere What the fuck happened? I told you... she slipped How? You can believe whatever you like, I don't care Why are you still here? I found these... Was Lu taking them? She had been for a while She never told me You don't go around telling everybody what pills you're taking? It's something a couple should share, though, isn't it? She used to... It's very easy to intrude in an eight year relationship Of course at first nothing bothers you. Nothing bothers her but basically, what really happens, is that you don't know each other You didn't know Luna. You haven't a clue what it was like living with her. You didn't even know what pills she was taking... It was a matter of time, that's all... There's no telling now... I suppose that's why you're still here Did she ever told you that she couldn't stand the smell of you anymore? That she'd been faking it for years? She never asked you to stop painting her, filming her, using her... when Luna started telling me what it was like living with you... how she hated being your object. That's enough. That's bullshit... Luna... was everything. She was... my life. You create... to try to get to the truth of something, something that... otherwise you... I don't know... So art comes first, is that it? Artists don't give a damn about anyone else. They only care about their own bullshit Did Lu take these? When we went to Paracas she told me she didn't want to photograph the sea any more... but she still wanted to be near it. Luna always wanted us to move to the beach house. I just moved to a place on the ocean. I was waiting for her and when she didn't arrive I left a set of keys with the porter. I told him that a girl called Luna would be coming by and that he should give her the keys... She came round one day to take some pictures for her school paper. We talked for a while, she fell asleep. She woke up at around 10 at night. A few days later she came back with her things... she told me she couldn't remember sleeping that well... that day she stayed. She was in her final year at high school and had one month to go to graduate. One day, her father, who was younger than me, came round looking for me. I didn't put up a fight. He broke my nose, two ribs... I didn't see Luna for a while, and then one day she showed up... with a bag. I met her at a bookstore opening. She blew me away as soon as I saw her. A few days later she told me that she lived with you... she never ate breakfast, did she? Never... I once heard her say that the only thing that she could stand before midday was water But she ate plenty at night She had two moles on the sole of her left foot She had 27 moles on her body... two of them were red The first time we made love I felt like I was someone else... her body always felt hot, as if she had a slight fever, as if she was about to get sick... I'd never felt that way with anyone. She said the same to me. We'd discovered something new... together The first time we made love... she had the body of a girl. I thought she might break. It was a very strange feeling... Are you going to show this? A painter friend likes to say that when you show a piece... it stops being yours, you lose it... I didn't want to lose her... You lost her a long time ago My work was her work... it was going to carry on... it was going to be alive... I especially like this one... it's really good, powerful, and this one I really like too... What do you think? Her eyes are direct and at the same time innocent, wouldn't you say? He's reached maturity with this show, there's no question... Alfredo! I'd like you to meet Mr. Stone Congratulations. Your work is extraordinary Mr. Stone wants to take the show to New York in April... he's been asking me about your muse. Where is Luna? Come. I'd like to introduce you to some people...
