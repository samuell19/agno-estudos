The Rape of Aphrodite Dedicated to the 3 dead of the 9th May 1957 rally for Cyprus in Athens. Our unit arrived at Diorios. We regrouped and it was there where the second invasion found us. 14th August... The loudspeaker, the alert, woke us up. 'Take positions outside the camp,' they said. We popped out and jumped into the slit trenches next to our anti-aircraft weapons, that is to say, some Brens used as anti-aircraft weapons... The planes appeared... They were falling on us with that horrible howl and we were trying to stick on the earth, to crawl on it, to become one with the earth. It was something horrible. The noise, the fear... Then, at one moment, we heard the loudspeaker saying: 'Attention, attention!' 'Your commander is speaking. It's an order. Don't shoot at any plane!' 'Pay attention! Don't shoot at any plane!' 'We just received a message that over Cyprus, over Greek Cyprus,' 'the Greek wings are flying at last.' They had picked up such... a signal... Such was the order they took. Well, as we were crawled on the soil, everyone... I say this, you know, and a shudder runs through me, everyone jumped out, firing into the air, terribly overjoyed. Mother Greece enters the war at last. Now we'll throw them into the sea. We left behind trenches and anti-aircraft weapons, and went back to the camp. In the kiosk we treated each other to a coffee, a cola... The commander broke down in tears... hugs, kisses, lieutenants with plain soldiers, colonels with plain soldiers... We never actually saw the Greek wings. The junta in Greece had fallen, but everything was in disarray. We were waiting in vain. Every day early in the morning, right? I'll be coming every day at 7, if that suits you, okay? So then, it is 14 years, eh? You said that you were abroad that long, no? That's much too long. Different times! Who could ever believe that the Turks will come! The times were different when you left. But the Turks, as it seems, prepared that for years. We've left with almost nothing. They took everything from us. Last week, on my way back from Kourion, from a taxi ride, at the entrance of Ipsos I saw my friend, Aftonomos. Aftonomos is a fisherman, a refugee from Karavas. 'Get out to have a beer together, Themistocles old mate!' I did. While having our beer and chatting, an armoured car passed, an English one... Then Aftonomos turns to me and says: 'They have squeezed us, Themistocles old chap, between the military bases and the sea. Everyone of us must make a raft and have it ready. It's the only way to save yourself in case the Turks set out to the south.' What an idea! Didn't the Turks do away with the Armenians like this? They started the massacre in '96 and finished it in '14, eh? God helps those that help themselves, as the proverb says. - Where are you from? - From Varosi. - So, you are a refugee. - Yes, from Lower Varosi. A taxi driver then in Varosi, a taxi driver now... We left in haste to save our necks from the bombardment, almost barefoot and with just a few bed sheets we had in the taxi by chance. They're still back there. My daughter's dowry... She was going to get married on 21st of July. And the taxi... I saved it... and it saved us.... On 21st of July, eh? - Sunday... - Yes. That Sunday... Her fianc? has gone missing. And think that on Saturday 20 July, day of the invasion, he saved his neck by a hair's breadth. As he was going to his battalion by a commandeered lorry, a 'Phantom' suddenly appeared. It fired at them and dropped even a napalm bomb. He was saved by a hair's breadth only to go missing at the battles in Agios Ilarionas. My daughter was left alone. She's still waiting. To wake up in the mornings with EOKA-B outside your windows... [EOKA-B: Nationalist paramilitary group] [National Anthem of Greece] The National Guard intervened today in order to stop the fratricidal war between the Greeks. All armed resistance in the island has ceased to exist. This is only an internal affair among the Greeks. The National Guard has now assumed full control of the situation. Makarios is dead. Greek Cypriot People (voice of the putschist, Nikos Sampson) In the name of God and in the name of the People and after my honorary selection by the Armed Forces of our People I assumed today the presidency of Cypriot Republic. You all know the incidents that occurred up until now and imposed the urgent intervention of the armed sons of our country... Greek Cypriot People, the voice you hear is familiar. You know who is speaking. I am Makarios. The one you elected to be your leader. I am not dead, as it would please the junta of Athens and their agents here. I am alive and I am on your side a comrade and a standard bearer in the joint fight! State of Emergency Communiqu?, nr 1. It is reported that today in the morning Turkish airplanes without warning, cunningly and cowardly, raided the radar station, bombarded the camp of the Hellenic Force of Cyprus and dropped a small airborne force inside the Nikosia-Agyrta Turkish Cypriot enclave. The Greek Cypriot forces face with bravery... On 15th of January 1950 the referendum on 'Union' [with Greece] took place. It was Sunday. That day something strange happened Snow fell not only on the mountains but also on the plains. All Cyprus was covered by snow all the way to the sea. I recall it as if it were a dream. I was 12 years old back then. After 5 years, in '55, EOKA would launch the armed struggle for Union. In July of '56, I joined the rebels in the mountains. A patrol had stopped in our village. A corporal and a sergeant in a 'Land Rover.' They ordered coffee. The coffee-shop owner treated them to a cognac. Within two hours they had got plastered and they were both throwing up in the water closet. They had left behind on a chair two 'Thompsons' they carried with them. We had been watching them for a long while. We rushed at them and battered them to pieces. We didn't kill them. We only smacked them up. There were three of us. We picked up the two Thompsons and took to the mountains. I was already 18 years old. - EOKA-B, eh? - Yes. EOKA-B. A roadblock. Your IDs. - Where are you going? - To the grove of Achna. We're looking for this gentleman's relatives. - Who's the gentleman? - He's a Cypriot living in England. - Is the car boot unlocked? - It is. - Shall I get out? - No, stay in the car. Are these bed sheets in the back? Yes. - Strange... - It's the dowry... It just happened... All right. Go. Some great men... Bastards... Rats... I'm a refugee because of them. Damn you! What's their problem with the bed sheets? Ruffians! To hell with you! Ask my daughter about the bed sheets... They act tough with their Kalashnikovs... My God! Give me patience... - Well? - Well, here I am, married too. I have two children, you know. The little girl that spoke to you on the phone is my daughter. She's already 10 years old. My son is younger. He's almost 2 like your son. - When was your son born? - On 29 August 1972. Mine on 15 January 1972. He's a little bit older. My wife comes from Varosi. That is, a refugee. Did you live in Varosi? Yes, we lived in Varosi for the last ten years. Now, we're staying at my mother's, you know. I received from my wife's dowry a piece of land by the sea. We built a block of flats. We had a good life. This whole affair of the invasion has naturally hurt our interests. Nevertheless, the things will get fixed. There's unemployment. Wages are low. Housing, as I see it, will become a problem. It's already a problem, definitely a major one. Provided that the Turks won't come further down, of course. Anyway... I agreed with two friends to form a company and start building blocks of flats.... in Nicosia, in Limassol... Naturally, you understand... We mustn't lose our mind, Evagoras. We must think calmly, reasonably. We had a lot of money. We were rich. The government must help us, give us loans. To 're-make' ourselves. Do you agree? Anyway... I've said enough. Now it's your turn. You know, we talk with friends all the time about these things and I was carried away.... So, it's your turn now. Tell me. Have you been in Cyprus long? Your wife? Your son? Have you come alone? How about your job? Did you manage? A philologist? Yes. In a college of Orlando University. I teach Greek literature. Still... I don't know, I don't understand. Or I probably understand... Listen, Onisilos... I'll explain things to you in a few words. I'm really in a tight spot. I wouldn't like to bother you with my troubles. You have your own worries. Yet... As I told you, I got married. A bit late, but I took the decision. My wife came to Cyprus on holiday on 9 July along with my son. They went to my village, to be close to my mother. I've never seen them again since. I was going to come too on 20 July, but... I came at the end of August. I had been injured in a car accident on 1st of August. You know... The nerves... the tension created by the events... I saw everything on TV. To watch and to be tied... To can't pick up a station on the Radio... To can't hear... The airfields closed... the same with the ports... I stayed in hospital for three weeks. Now I'm searching. I'm trying to find them. But there's too many people missing... You will find them, Evagoras. I'll help as much I can. Just not to forget... I have a surprise for you. Look here what I found at my mother's. Two identical copies were preserved in an envelope for 16 years now. What's this? 'You said: I'll go to another country [Poem by C.P. Cavafy] go to another shore, find another city better than this one.' 'You won't find another shore. This city will always pursue you. You will always end up in this city.' - This was our motto. - Yes. Thank you, Onisilos. Right when you phoned, I put it in my pocket. You should know that a similar one exists in the Museum of National Liberation Struggle - That's history! - In Mahairas... in '56. Wasn't it in '56? 9/3/56. My birthday. And the day the English exiled Makarios to Seychelles. (Together) We grew old. Remember the others? Pericles... now an advertiser. He succeeded in life. This one went to Greece in '67. I heard he worked in television there. Some broadcasts for the junta, you know. Nonetheless he succeeded. He made a lot of money. The other one is Hermes. This one is Epaminondas. Remember him? He became a policeman. He remained the same later as he was then in the mountains, always complaining that he was 'neglected,' 'unfairly treated,' he was moping like that... He ended up in EOKA-B. They naturally kicked him out the police before the coup. Now he's going around long-haired, bearded, and with a Kalashnikov over the shoulder. Paris Agathokleous from Leonari asks anyone knowing anything about his relatives to contact the Search Bureau of Missing Relatives Hephaestus Patroklou from Trikomo is in search of his relatives. Herodotus Sophokleous from Karoussa is in search of his relatives. [The list of people in search of their missing relatives goes on] Meeting Space of Relatives & Missing Persons. [Traditional lullaby] Hello. - You're Evagoras, aren't you? - Uncle Kimonas! - Is that you? - Yes, my son. You recognized me, eh? if it wasn't for that gentleman who showed you to me I wouldn't recognize you. You're away so many years now. Well, tell me, sonny, when did you come? Five-six days ago. I heard your name and came to talk with you. Go on, have a seat. You know, I'm left alone here, too. - Whose is the little guy? - Try to figure out. He's my grandson. Son of my son, Neocles. Remember him? You used to be friends. Come along and take a seat, uncle. Sit down. My Neocles has gone missing. Whether he's alive or dead, or captive, or in Turkey's prisons... no one knows. I wish he was in one of their prisons. We're left alone, I and Mitsis. Don't ask how we managed to get here. It's a long story. The others made a stop at Korkon and stayed there. My wife, my sons, and the rest of grandchildren. All of them. Only him... What is it, dear? - Tell your uncle your name, sonny. - Evagoras. Evagoras? We have the same name, eh? Come over here. I'm taking him for a moment only, uncle Kimonas. Well, tell me. How old are you? - Seven. - Seven years old? - So, you go to school, eh? - Yeah. Have you seen my family, uncle Kimonas? My wife, my son... my mother, my father... You must have seen them. My wife came to Cyprus on 9 July before the putsch. - I've seen Adonis. - Have you really seen him? I've seen them, my son. Both your wife, Aphrodite, and your son. Yet, I don't know where they're now. I heard Nicosia's schools accommodate many people from our village. Go there and have a look. Maybe they're down there. They took all my properties. Tough times fell upon us. Wars, disasters, emigration... Come in. - Good morning. Your tea. - Thank you. Are you going out? I'm asking because I want to tidy up the room a bit. Please. Do you come from the place over there? Yes. From the village we can see? No. My village is behind the mountain. Behind that mountain peak. That means... you can neither go to it nor see it. Exactly. Have you been away for long? Fourteen years. How might it be there now? As if I never came back. First immigrant, then refugee... Strange thing... It's all the same... Watermelons! If you went away 14 years ago, you couldn't be in Cyprus in '63, right? No I wasn't. Rough times. Want a cigarette? Those were rough times but compared to nowadays... '63 was... I don't know why I brought it to mind. In '63 I was coming back from Karavas along with a co-partner. So, I was together with Damianos loaded with lemons like the watermelons in front. Well, passing through the Kioneli... Remember Kioneli? Remember when in '57 the Turks slaughtered in Kioneli the partisans from Kontomeno? Our boys? Of course, these were dirty tricks of the English. That was the village... You were in Cyprus in '57, weren't you? Yes, I was. I remember. Well then, we were passing through Kioneli in '63. As soon as we got to Kioneli, Makarios renounced the agreements. We were about 50 vehicles in line, all Greeks. The Turks had set up an offhand barricade and they started threatening us with their fists, with sticks, hoes, pitchforks... Some were waving cleavers like those Butchers have. 'This is our end,' I said to Damianos. Nevertheless, they let us pass. After a couple of hours, the upheavals in Nicosia began. Again, the English mafia instigated all this. It was the 24th of December, on Christmas eve, in '63. That's how it is, dear Evagoras. The Turks turned them over to the Red Cross. And we went all together to pick her up. There were too many girls, beautiful like early dew. That good-for-nothing husband of hers came along with his long face... Our Aphrodite kept crying, crying for hours. And he... couldn't be bothered to approach her. I'm your aunt and, still, I feel shame saying all these to you. He neither then nor later tried to get closer to her. His manners became strange... He would start quarrelling for no reason at all. And eventually... he started speaking of divorce. And may it was only that... Whenever our Aphrodite went through the refugee camp, all women were giving her such a look... as though my daughter had wanted what happened... One day, he said to her: 'It would be better, if you were dead.' He preferred her dead rather than what happened to her... And in the end... He went away and left her alone. 'I must go away as well, I must,' my daughter was saying, too. But where to go with the baby? How to support it? What to do? In the end... She went away leaving the baby to me. She went to Greece alone. If you could see her, you'd have empathized with her. She became all skin and bones. As for the good-for-nothing husband of hers... a deafening silence. It was a question of pride for him. The pride... I myself don't even know what this pride is all about. Come on, love. Eat up and go to play. As concerns your mother now, go see her. Though it's even better... besides your mother... to visit your cousin in hospital. He'll be very glad to see you. I went with your uncle to see him yesterday. He's getting better. Luckily... my son was rescued. Go... see him, he's better. And my wife? My son? Have you ever seen them again, aunt? As I told you before, we saw them the first day the came from England, before the putsch. We saw them once at your mother's. But then... we've never seen them again... neither your son... nor your Aphrodite. I don't know... I haven't seen them, dear Evagoras. I haven't seen them. When the Turkish tanks passed by, we realized that we were trapped. There were four of us, reservists. We tried helter-skelter to hide until the night comes. Thucydides, one of my comrades, more or less knew the area. We had to reach the bases. It was our only hope of rescue because we knew that the Turks would never get into the bases of the English. We had to find water too. We hadn't drank any for 24 hours. Our mouths were dried from the thirst. We blanched like the flour, our lips were chapped. When the night came, we walked for a while. We covered a long distance but the dawn came early. We found a sheep pen and sneaked in. We had to wait for the night, again. There we found water. We quenched our thirst. There were some lambs in the pen. We thought of slaughtering one but the smoke... We were hungry. Near to noon we saw someone coming from afar. We figured out that he was a Turk because he did nothing to hide. We were afraid no matter if he was just one, and we, four. We had no weapons either. We threw them away, when we realized that the pen pushers we had for officers, the men of 'junta,' had abandoned us. Anyway, to revert to my story, we saw the Turk coming directly to us and we didn't know where to hide. We simply pulled back inside the shed. It seems that he got scared as well because he stood for a while when he saw us. Yet, he made up his mind and came closer. He got into the pen and headed right away to the shed. He was roughly 55-60 years old. He stood at the door because it was hard to see us. It was dark inside. He looked for us with his eyes and, when he spotted us, said something in Turkish we didn't understand. Then he said to us in Greek: 'Don't be afraid.' 'I'm a Cypriot too. Hasanis.' He came close to us. He gave his hand and introduced himself. We told him we were hungry. He said he'll come back. So he left. But we were in fear for our lives. 'What if he betrays us?' Nevertheless, he came back and brought us food. Bread, olives, halloumi cheese and milk. We satisfied our hunger. We hadn't eaten for two days. Then Hasanis turns to us and says: 'We're leaving for the bases at night, lads.' 'I'll show you the way.' We couldn't believe our ears. Nevertheless, he came. It was a dark night without moonlight. Hasanis was going ahead we were following behind. We were following him like children following their parents. That blindly... After a two-hour walk, some orange lights showed up in the distance. The bases... While marching, we suddenly hear a voice: 'Halt!' We got frozen. That 'Halt' was a bit abrupt, crude... It wasn't the Turks. It was the English. They came to us. When their sergeant on charge learnt that Hasanis is a Turk got confused. He asked him again as if he couldn't believe what he heard. And Hasanis told him again: 'I'm a Turk.' - 'But a Cypriot.' - However the Englishman insisted. '- Don't you know these ones are Greeks? - I know it but they're Cypriots too.' Hasanis answered. They were speaking English but we could understand a few things. Then Hasanis turns to us and says: 'Good-bye lads!' 'I have to go.' Diomedes, one of us, gave him his hand to greet him: 'We thank you, Hasanis.' And they kissed each other on both cheeks. Then we did the same. And he went away. That suddenly, without turning back, without saying anything. He went away. The English interrogated us, write down our names, asked where we're from, if we were soldiers... We said we are reservists. - 'Makarios?' An English says. - 'Yes, yes!' We answer him. They put us in a Land Rover. 'We'll turn you over to Cypriot Authorities.' They turned us over to EOKA-B. There were four, unshaved, bearded... As soon as the English left, they put us in another Land Rover. Two of them sat in the front, the other two in the back with us. 'Reservists, eh?' said one of those in the back. They were holding Kalashnikovs, the four of them. As about us... we didn't say a word. We kept our mouths shut. Either they had recognized us or the English had turned us in. All the time when they were underground we were hunting them down Now, the State was them. They were holding us tight. They took us to a police station. We got out. Another dozen of young men, unshaved like them, fall on us. They beat us to a pulp, they pulverized us. Then they tied us up, stuck plasters on our mouths and put us once more in the Land Rover. 'Say your prayers,' said to us, 'Commies!' They brought us to a shed. And without lots of words, they put our backs against the wall. With the fist volley, a bullet shot me. I passed out. They might have thought that I was dead. Around noon some shepherds found us. I was saved. But Thucydides, Orestes and Diomedes... are dead. They have killed them. I'm not sure, Evagoras... whether it was a dream or not but I will never forget it. I can't take it out of my mind. Before going away, after they shoot us one of them hang the Kalashnikov at the shoulder, stood next to the whitewashed wall and pissed... Beside us. Out of fear? Out of guilt? I can't say. But I will never forget it. I keep seeing him in front of me... pissing... on the white wall. - Who died? - A soldier. We had infiltrated and occupied the fort Koutsakagia. We kept it for ten hours and then abandoned it because we left out of bullets. We left back a dead. We fell back towards Profitis Elias hill. Then lorries took us down to Karavas-Kyrenia route. After that we continued on foot. We were 45 altogether. We formed groups of six, put the weapons crosswise and marched on singing like in a parade. From the slit trench the Lokatzides (Mountain Raiders) attack with irresistible momentum attack like untamed lions... I sincerely believed, and all did the same, that we were meant to go like that up to Kyrenia in groups of six, in formation of parade and singing. And I was looking forward to sit at the small port of Kyrenia, have a beer and listen to the mullets jumping out of the water. A plane of Turkish Air Force was flying above. Two miles further down, the Turks were landing. But our morale was high. We heard the radio saying the corpses of the Turks float on the sea of Kyrenia. We had torn apart the enemy. It was Sunday, 21st of July, around noon. While marching on in groups of six and singing, we suddenly saw some of our own vehicles burnt away. Almost immediately, we heard firings. It was the Turks. Our formation was split away and opened up. We were one mile away from the landing point. There was something like a natural embankment ahead and, then, a plateau, scarce houses, bright green fields... We took cover at the embankment and started firing. The captain comes to me and says: 'Disperse your men, each one 100 m. away from the other.' I protested. '100 m. are too many.' He says to me: 'You know that we're only 45.' Honestly, I thought of giving up and leaving. I said to him: 'Why don't go? What could 45 men do?'' 'We'll get killed.' 'No one leaves,' he says to me. 'We're staying here.' We held out from Sunday noon to late evening. 8 hours of battle without moving from there. We didn't go ahead but we didn't fall back either. We couldn't even lift our heads up. They were shelling us from everywhere. From mortars, from above, from ships. One of us died. It wasn't from our squad. We found him lying with his weapon. Next day, with the first light of dawn, we carried out an attack, The groups of Turks we met were falling back, retreating. We moved forward from Anemomylos to Clearchus. We had such a great feeling... as we were seeing them fleeing away, as we were moving forward. We were 45... Think of us being 1.000! 2.000! And instead of fighting the enemy at the mountain hitting him at the sea, at the landing point. The same day, Monday 22nd of July, they started unloading tanks. It was so terrible while you can't give a fight to hear the ships of Turks... and the cranes... unloading tanks... And you, standing there, watching and not being able to do anything. Only watching. In 28th of July, a company of infantry was trapped. They asked help from our squad. From the 45 of us, the half went to help. In 29th of July I was injured by a grenade and a bullet in the arm. They carried me to Lapithos Hospital. There, I found the captain injured, too. 'What are you doing here, staff sergeant?' '- I was injured. - And has the company left alone?' '- Yes. - Let's go!' We got into a Land Rover and left. He didn't believe he would find his soldiers there. Yet, there were all of them still there and they were fighting because the truce was over. Then, the captain sat down and started crying. The shells kept dropping close to us. 'Greetings to you!' 'It's worth staying in this island to die.' He was a 'pen pusher' from Karpenisi. We held out till the beginning of the attack on the axis Karavas-Lapithos. Then... we retreated. - Where are we now? - Ikosi, a Turkish village. The Turks were forced to leave in '63-64 due to the upheavals. TMT's (Turkish Cypriot Resistance) job, of course. You know. From '55... Agents of Ankara and of the English forced them to leave and go to the regions they controlled themselves already since then. With coercion, violence, terrorism... a lot of beating, a lot of stabbing... They managed to make their own people refugees... The Turks, that is TMT, had their aim of course. 'Taksim.' Partition. In '55 they had to prove that all of a sudden Greeks and Turks cannot live together. With the passage of time, the houses collapsed and became deserted as you can see them now. Leave her alone! My son... My son... Watch your son, Aphrodite! I feel sleepy. No, no on the bed! The bed... My son... My son! I want to sleep. But not on the bed! Not on the bed! I feel sleepy, feel sleepy... He had got the demeanour of Elpenor right before he fell and broke his neck. However he wasn't drunk. There were three of us. We picked up the two Thompsons and took to the mountains. I was already 18 years old. They welcomed us warmly, up there. The struggle was hard. But we knew what we were fighting for. And it wasn't all about getting rid of the English... liberation of the country, self-determination or union... We were fighting for many other things along them. For a feeling of individual freedom, dignity, self-respect... [We demand the Union of Cyprus with Greece] (Camera pauses on names of Turkish Cypriots who signed the petition) In September of '55, the well-known events took place in Istanbul. The same day... there was bloodshed in Cyprus too. Everything went according to plan. It was during the days of the Tripartite Conference in London. Following that, the English set up the Auxiliary Force, a special police force consisted exclusively of Turks, most of them secret members of TMT. Now the Turks could legitimately kill and repress under the umbrella of Power. The English turned a blind eye to all that. Despite the ongoing bloodshed, we, Greeks, were showing self-restrain. Because it was too obvious where all this was leading to. If we were to respond, we would ignite the fire. But the blood is blood. It's boiling hot... Once, twice... the third time one couldn't take it any more and answered. So we and the Turks started killing each other. The English were rubbing their hands together. Then, Afxentiou was killed. [Gymnasium of All Cyprus] Little Aphrodite! Little Aphrodite! [Honorary plaque] [in the memory of the students who fell during national liberation struggle.] Little Aphrodite! Little Aphrodite! Little Aphrodite! Uncle Brillios had a (turkey) stag [Children's song] Uncle Brillios had a stag Very large, very large Feeding him, feeding him with bread and salt To make him fat To make him fat Feeding him, feeding him with bread roll To make him roll To make him roll Feeding him, feeding him with bread filled with cream To make him big To make him big Feeding him, feeding him with pastries made of flour He no longer fitted to pass through the door To pass through the door Then, a day without sun The stag munched the uncle Munched the uncle. Little Aphrodite! Little Aphrodite! She's in there. Then, Afxentiou was killed. After his death, more and more killings came. The English were rubbing their hands together. Then, one morning, the struggle came to an end. We were who fired the guns but our future was decided elsewhere, without us. So, instead of self-determination and union we were compelled to accept independence, and, on top of that, a crippled, mutilated independence. This outcome was the greatest disappointment for us because we had fought for one thing, and we were compelled to accept another. 'So much suffering,' 'so much life went into the abyss' 'all for an empty tunic' 'all for a Helen.' (from 'Helen,' a poem by G. Seferis) There was no way to make a living either. In December of 1960, my mother packed my things into a suitcase, I borrowed an old jacket, and with 5 pounds in my pocket, my father's savings, I left for England. What's going on? They're burning newspapers speaking about Makarios' return. [Afxentiou lives!] [Shame on you, traitors!] [Afxentiou lives!] Wait a moment. I've seen our aunt... and our mother. Maybe, she's the happiest of all. She's far from all this. A long way off. And happy. What about our father? The father is dead. Neocles was lost in the battles of Agios Ilarionas. Only the two of us left behind, Evagoras. I want to ask you something but I can't utter it. Have you seen Aphrodite? My son? Do you know where they are? We went and took them from the airport. Aphrodite and your son... Have you seen Aphrodite? My son? Do you know where they are? We went and took them from the airport. Aphrodite... and your son... are... dead, Evagoras. Near to noon, the Turkish aircraft showed up. There were 5 Phantoms, painted black. They flied over Ksero. they rose high above the mountains, they went down over Kakopetria and Skouriotissa, and headed all the way towards our guardhouse in Stefani. They passed at low height over us. We were really scared shitless, we were lost. I felt like hiding in a dug hole where no one could see me. The fear is so horrible under that lasting terrifying howl. Especially when they fire their shots, it's like hell. Before they came back, I had taken my position, at the machine gun which was convertible to anti-aircraft weapon It was possible with special mountings. Yet, we didn't have them. The planes were sighted again attacking from Skouriotissa. As I saw them coming against me, I aimed and pulled the trigger till the ammunition belt run out of bullets. They dropped napalm bombs. One of us caught fire. 'Help me, boys! Help! Help!' he was yelling and crying out. He was burning like a candle. He didn't fall down. He remained standing on his feet. 'I'm burnt' he cried out and, then, became prey of the flames. A fire in the shape of a man. He burnt to ashes. We replaced the ammunition belt. I saw them coming back and rushing at us. I gritted my teeth and squeezed the trigger again. The ammunition belt run out of bullets. I realized that I had hit one at least. I saw it smoking. It plunged into the sea at Morfou Bay. It was the plane they mentioned in the 21st war communiqu?. There was a dead silence around. Nothing was to be heard. Everything was quiet. In this immense quiet we were alone. The time had stopped. The life. We came closer to the soldier who was burnt. I reached out my hand... The moment I touched him, he disintegrated. He turned to dust. He was reduced to ashes. A handful of ashes... that scattered over the soil. Come in. Do you want anything else? - No, thank you. - May I tidy up the room a bit? Yes, please. Does your neighbour annoy you? - Do you mean the music? - Yes. No, it's all right. He's an old violinist, a refugee from Kyrenia. He brought along a violin, a suitcase full of records and an old phonograph. Nothing else. He stays in and listens to the music all the time. Like you do lately... I'm asking because there some people that get irritated with the music. It doesn't bother me at all. - What's your name? - Afra... from Aphrodite. Return (Poem by C.P. Cavafy) often and take me beloved sensation Return and take me when the memory of the body awakens, and an old desire runs again through the blood when the lips and the skin remember, and the hands feel as if they touch again. Return often and take me at night, when the lips and the skin remember.... As I've already told you on the phone, the gentleman here is a man of trust and friend of mine. First of all I'd like to thank you for agreeing to help me. I'm interested in... I'm interested in a Bren gun with 500 bullets and like number of magazines, 20 sticks of dynamite and a pistol with silencer. I'll do my best. The money must be in five-pound notes, cash. My great love, you've lit up my dreams and you've given meaning to my life New words I'm trying hard to find to tell you my great secret but whenever I see you, I'm dazed and confused, I can't make it to say anything at all. Good evening. How's life treating you? Shall we have a drink? All right, I see... Don't insist. Why? Are you in pain? No. Another man? It was April of '67. One late evening, I saw a man from my village carry weapons to a barn. He was a member of a secret organisation. I can't recall which... I never remember details... It was before EOKA-B. I only remember that what I'd seen by chance had to be kept secret by all means. He had to shut up my mouth. So, in order to be sure he made a dead set at me. He raped me. How easy it is to say this word now... He had a lot of pull, he knew all the cops, he was well in with a Minister, he wasn't afraid of anyone. I could see that he liked me for a long time before. That whole story was just a pretext. He had a front gold tooth. He was biting my shoulder till it bled. It was late April of '67. I've never told anyone anything. In September of the same year, I got engaged. An arranged marriage. The same night, my fianc? kicked me out. I wasn't a virgin. I tried to put an act... but I couldn't fool him. Then, my father and brother started bashing me. I couldn't stand living in the village any more. The one who ruined me promised to do something for me. I went down to the city, I was young, he found a job for me. In December of '67 he fixed my papers to leave for Athens. I worked at a bar in Philonos Street and then at other clubs... This year after seven years... I made up my mind to come back. On 9th of July, Thursday evening, I arrived at Nicosia. By Tuesday, I'd got a job in Kyrenia. On Monday, the coup d??tat took place. On Saturday, the invasion... The Turks... I made it at least to see Kyrenia but I couldn't make it to go to my village though I wanted it so much. It's seven years now since I left home, and never went back. I feel as a stranger here in this city. I'm twice a refugee as you can see. Anyway... Later I learnt that my brother was killed during the coup d??tat. Our family is left-wing. They killed him. On Friday 19 July, although the bars were closed because of the putsch, I went to bed late. I kept company to a girlfriend, a workmate from the bar. The very same night, police notified her boyfriend to report to his unit. They knew, you see, that the Turks were coming. He was a Lokatzis (Mountain Raider). He's gone missing at the battles of Agios Ilarionas. I mustn't have slept more than a couple of hours when the bombardment started We had rented a room in an old two-storey hotel. After the first explosions, everyone in the building ran for shelter in the basement. There were ten of us. Eight women among us. There was also a couple from a house nearby along with their 5-year old little girl, and old man, and, later, a soldier came too. He had a leg injury. He was bleeding. We stayed in the basement for two days. Throughout Saturday evening we were hearing bombs blasting. The building was shaking. The same on Sunday. On Monday, the noise of tanks covered everything else. Before the night falls, they found us. There were 7 of them with shaven heads, Turks from Turkey. They killed the soldier on the spot. His brain was splattered all over the floor. They separated the three youngest women of us and the woman with the baby from the others. The little girl was crying. By pushing and making angry gestures they showed us to go up the stairs... We were acting like we couldn't understand. Then, a Turk grabbed the married woman from the tit... Her husband rushed to stop him. They shot him... He only said 'My Aphrodite...' and fell dead on the spot. The little one clung to her mother and was shouting to me. The Turks pulled her away and threw her on the floor. She was hit and passed out next to soldier's splattered brains. As for us... We were crying. No matter what we can say... if you don't see it with your own eyes... I can't use so many words for something that happened in two shakes. One of them remained down to guard. The other six took us upstairs. The hotel was deserted. I don't know why... I had nothing to lose. But something deep inside me pushed me to resist. I just didn't want it, didn't like it. There were two of them. They rushed at me. They tore apart my skirt, my blouse... Only my knickers' waistband remained. They smashed me. Twice each one of them. They were biting me, at the ribs, at the throat, at the lips... They finished and went away. I was worn out. Incapable of thinking or moving. The door was hardly shut and another one coming from the next room got in. Naked. I was naked too. I couldn't put anything on me in time. They had torn all my clothes apart. I had a fit of madness. I resisted again. He defeated me. He was a savage, a beast, I felt his teeth sink into my body... into my breast... I passed out. When I came round, I was lying in a pool of blood. I'll tell you one thing, Evagoras. After these seven years of my life at the bar... I came to suddenly realize... or, better, I never understood how it is possible to sell something that shouldn't have any value since it is natural and abundant. I can't understand why all this misery... Don't talk any more... I can feel you. It is perhaps here where the cause of your rape lies, Aphrodite. One day I watched a French film. The heroine, an aristocratic lady... walks out on her husband and goes away with a young man she met by chance. 'I'm happy, I'm happy' she says to her beloved man. 'Only if I could spend my whole life like that...' 'My life started anew with you.' I feel the same. Thank you, Evagoras. Welcome in my life. You're the first man for me. I'm ashamed to confess it. At your side, for the first time in my life, I came... to know. I'm feeling free. Like flying. I can't find the right words. The words alone are not enough. Whatever I could say to you... The words alone are not enough. I'm feeling... I'll be right back. I'll be right back, Aphrodite. Come in, - Hello, Evagoras. - Hello to you. - I wasn't late, eh? - No. They made me delay in the lift. Someone committed suicide. A violinist threw out of the window an old phonograph and suitcase full of records and hanged himself with the strings of his violin. I was in a hurry. I didn't stop to learn all the details. This must be the other - come in! I'm sorry for being a little late... They transfer the Turks to the north for population exchange. I was forced to drive round so they wouldn't stop me. There they are! Here's the money. - Is there any possibility of a jam? - No, they're checked. I must go now. Good-bye. Evagoras, will you think it over, again? - It's never too late. - It's impossible, Themistocles. I never came back. After fourteen years, I'm still a stranger... but not any more in the land of mist... If only I could see behind the mountain, behind Pentadaktylos. Everything has changed on this side here. Over there? How might my neighbourhood look like? And what about Adonis, Aphrodite? I can't do otherwise, Themistocles... old mate. Thank you. You must go now. There's no time left. I'm coming back, Aphrodite. [Halt! Towards Turkish-occupied area.] 'But even so I wish and long day by day to reach my home, and to see the day of my return.' Odyssey, Book V, 219-220.
