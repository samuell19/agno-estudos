Que diabos foi sso? Puta merda. Hey, you guys, wake up. Do you see this? Hey, Craig. Come on! We gotta check this out, some kinda plane crash. Will you guys wake up? All right. - Come on! - All right. You little shit. Sheriff, sheriff cinder, did you see it? There was a big fireball out in the sky! What? Out by marsh cliff. Come on, take a look. Look at it, right there. Jesus, must have been lightning. Hell, I ain't never seen lightning like that before. You saw it too, huh, sheriff? What the hell was it, Pete? I don't know. Some kind of big bright thing came out of the sky. We're gonna have to get out there. You better call Lisa, sheriff. Oh, let her sleep. She's used to desk work. She is a deputy and she is qualified. All right, I'll call her. You go try to round up a few more men. Right. I can probably round up a couple guys, sheriff. Good. Hello? Jack, what's going on? All right, give me a few minutes. I'll be right there. I guess we better get out there before old Jerry gets lost. I bet he was drinking a beer. Me too. Jerry? Jerry? Jerry? Ah! - Jerry? - Jesus Christ! What the hell is that? I don't know. Why are we stopping, uncle Dave? You kids stay put, I'm just gonna take a minute. He has to take a leak. Damn, what are you trying to do? Give me a heart attack? That's not very funny. - Uncle Dave! - Uncle Dave! There's somebody up there! I've had enough of you kids tonight. Now get back in the car. What about uncle Dave? I don't know. Uncle Dave! Well, go help him! Come here. Kim, look. A house, come on. Do you hear that? What? Somebody's running towards the house. Letit run, it's probably an animal. That's no animal, somebody's running. All right, I'll check. Glenn, be careful. Don't worry. What do you think it is, sheriff? I don't know. Only one way to find out. Yeah, let's go. Pete! - Get down! - Jesus Christ! - Come on! - Come on! Berkeley, stop get down! Jack, get the fuck outta here! Lisa, let's go! Come on, let's go! Let's go! - Here. - Will, this is Jamie. I work with the sheriff's office. Listen, we've just come back from the woods. It'll be late soon. It might help us see that thing better. I don't know what good it'll do. We'll get it, we will get it. Okay, we've got bill Perkins and his son. They'll be here in 10 minutes. - Good. - Perkins? He's an Ace, a crack shot. If we can get him close enough. Look, I don't know what kind of weapon that thing is using, but I want it. Otherwise we don't have a chance in hell. That's why I want Perkins. Sheriff's office. Who? What, wait a minute, slow down. I can't understand you. Uh huh. All right, George, stay put. We're on our way. We're on our way right now. George Michaels, says he was driving on route seven near the old hargrove farm. Something weird ran in front of his car and he almost hit it. Wait here for Perkins, meet us out there. All right, Jack, be careful. Lisa, don't say a word. Just turn around slowly and follow me. Now! Get down, get down! What in the name of god is that thing, sheriff? I don't even wanna guess. All I want you to do is get that weapon out of the thing's hand. Think you can do it, bill? You bet your ass I can do it. Why don't you just blow the things head off, dad? Hey, get the weapon first then blow the thing's head off. I gotta get closer to that thing so I could get a good shot. Jimmy, you go on the other side and keep me covered. We'll try to draw its attention over here. You be careful, bill. Don't you worry. Are you ready, son? Yeah. All right, now! Jimmy! It's incredible, Jack. Just what I need right now. Look, Bert, we're gonna deal with this thing how we can for now, but I do want you to get in touch with state officials and get us some help in here. You don't understand, Jack. I've got this party for governor embry here this afternoon, remember? Election time, ass-kissing time. Bert, I've got some thing running around killing people. We lost Pete for Christ's sake and five other men plus bill Perkins's son! I don't give a shit about your party! I'm sorry about Pete, Jack, I'm truly sorry, but I can't cancel this party with the governor. I mean, I can't even get in touch with him. He and his aide are driving down from Carol county now. You cancel it. I'll get the governor out when he arrives. I've got people invited. I just can't call off this... Cancel it, Bert! I want this town evacuated today. Forget it, Jack, this is a big deal. I can't stop it now anyway. The governor is on his way! The people will be arriving any minute! I don't believe you. You don't know what's loose out there. Pete is dead for Christ's sake. I don't want anybody else dead. I want this town cleared out. Jack, we'll do our little number with the governor and then I promise we'll get out. Will you just call the state and get some help in here? Yes, yes, yes, I promise, Jack. I'll call them right away. Let's just not have a panic situation, huh? You do yourself a favor. You cancel this party and get yourself and Mary Jane the hell outta town. Oh, it all sounds so exciting! I wouldn't miss it for the world! I can't handle this. I'll see you later, Bert. I think I need another drink, honey. Okay, bertie. And don't call me bertie. What did the mayor say? He said we can't evacuate the town. So what do we do? We start evacuating the town, that's what we do. Wicker's not gonna like it. Tough shit! Look, I'm gonna drop you off at the office. Get Jamie and a couple of good men and start clearing the town out. What are you doing? I've got to meet Steven at notch cliff and pick up Mel Berkeley's body. You want me to take some of these ashes and try to analyze them, sheriff? No, we don't have time for that now. Let's just find Berkeley's body and get out of here. Where is it? Should be up here about 100 feet. Something's wrong. I know this is where he fell. There's definitely blood here, sheriff. But where's the body? There's more blood over there. Maybe Berkeley wasn't dead. He may have dragged himself out of here. Or been dragged away. Looks like I brought you out here for nothing, Steve. That's okay, Jack. It's my job. Hey, cinder, what brings you way out here away from your cozy little office? Keep moving, drago, before I run you in for disturbing the peace. Hey, I'm scared to death. A big tough sheriff may just try to take me off my bike. Huh, what about it, cinder? You gonna take me off my bike? Stay out of my way, drago. I'm in no mood for your crap. You know what I say, sheriff? Go to hell. No, no, no, wait a minute. That's too good for you. Clear out. Oh, sure thing, Mr. sheriff, sir. Oh, oh, say hi to that cute little girl deputy of yours. Yeah, I bet she's really something in the sack, huh? That scum, you outta lock him up. I don't wanna stink up my cell. Sheriff cinder, come in, please. Sheriff cinder, come in, please. This is cinder, what's up, Jamie? Sheriff, we just found Ben Cooper. His body's over at the dodd's house. Jack, it's half eaten. All right, I'm on my way. Step up the evacuation, huh? Don't worry, it's going well. Route 19 is jammed with cars. I'm so glad you're getting the people out of town, Jack. This is a nightmare. It sure is. I hope you and Steven are up for nightmares. You know I wouldn't demand it, but it might help if you two stuck around a while. Think nothing of it. We wouldn't have it any other way. Well, thanks, Ruth. Oh, Jack, while we wait, I almost forgot. The mayor called this morning. He was wondering if Steve and I are coming to the party he's giving for the governor. - Hey. - Idiot! I told him this morning to call that off. Come on, we better get out there. Is it all right if we stop by Suzie's house on the way? I haven't had the time to warn her. Drago's girl? Yeah, I've been seeing her lately. All right, come on. We've gotta make it fast. See ya later. - Bye, Steve. - Good luck. Leave me alone, drago! I told you we're finished! Babe, don't give me that crap. Come on, honey. I haven't seen you for a few days. Get off! Oh, you're getting rough, huh? You like that, huh? Don't you ever do that again. You hear me, don't you ever! You little slut, you're too good for me now, huh? Well, I know you've been seeing Jamie lambert, and let me tell you something, babe. You ain't good enough for him. He's got class you know and you ain't nothing, but a filthy little bitch! On! Damn it, drago was just here hassling here. Is she okay? Yeah, she said she could throw her stuff together and be out of here in a few minutes. Good, let's go. Right. Bitch! Now! Come on, you wanna fight, huh? You wanna fight, come on. Get up! Bert, it's really great to be here in your quaint little town. It's great to have you here, governor, and let me assure you that the people of Perry hill are behind you 100%. Good. You know, I didn't see too many people when we came through town. It seemed a little deserted. Well, it's Saturday morning. People are sleeping late. But let me assure you. Some of the nicest folks are right here. Nice indeed. Governor embry, this is my secretary, Mary Jane Carter. This is an honor, Mr. governor. Likewise, Ms. Carter. Oh, this is my aide, Mark Phillips. Mayor wicker. Ms. Carter. Governor, would you care for a drink? Mary Jane makes a mean Manhattan. The governor prefers vodka and water, mild, please. Mary Jane, would you get the governor a vodka and water? Mild. Sure, I'll be right back. What? Here you go, governor. Thank you, Mary Jane. Oh, my pleasure. I'm sorry, Mr. Phillips. Would you care for a drink? No, thank you, I never drink on the job. Oh, Bert and I always drink on the job. Don't we, bertie? Yes. Governor, what do you think of the campaign this year? It's pretty heavy, isn't it? Yes, we're going to steal a lot of money in Carol county. I'll bet. Well, you know, they have plenty there to steal. But then it would get to national... Yeah, would you excuse me for a moment, governor? Is is true he's gonna be the next governor? What the hell are you doing, Bert? I told you to call this thing off! Stop, the governor's right over there. I don't give a damn who's here. I want you to get these people out. Listen to me, they're just little... Didn't I make myself clear this morning? Why don't you go write yourself some damn parking tickets or something? You're gonna screw this whole thing up for me! I'm not gonna budge! I want these people outta here now! Jack, get the hell outta here! You're making the scene with the governor! I'm gonna start clearing these people out. Sheriff cinder, have you met the governor yet? Not now, Mary. Oh, governor, I'd like you to meet our esteemed sheriff, Jack cinder. Pleased to know you. How are you? Is there anything wrong, Bert? Oh, no, no, the sheriff just stopped by to say hello. He's a big supporter of you as a matter of fact. He's gonna work for you in the next campaign. Aren't you, Jack? Now, Jack, you just mind telling the governor what a great... Hey, look... Ladies and gentlemen, may I please have your attention. I'm sorry to interrupt this lovely party, but I'm afraid we're going to have to ask everyone to leave. We've just discovered that poison gas is leaking from the old mines and for your own safety we're evacuating the town. No, no, no, no, no. Oh my god! Oh, no! Oh, no! So that's why the streets were deserted. You lied to me, you son of a bitch! You knew about this all along. Believe me, you're going to regret this. Come along, governor. We must get you to safety. Thanks. I've gotta give it to you. It really worked. So does this mean I'm on the payroll? Way to go, Jamie. Well, now let's get back to the real evacuation. Bert, I want you and Mary Jane out of here too! I'm ruined. I'm ruined. There, there, bertie. It'll be all right. Don't call me bertie! What do you think? This is very curious. We better get a tissue sample. Right. Hey, doc. Wilton, what are you doing here? Krebs busted his leg. Oh, take him in the other room, okay? Which one? The one to your right. Okay. Steven, could you get the rest of the tissue sample? Sure. I want my whisky! I'll get it for you, krebs. Don't argue with krebs, doc. Sheriff's office, Jamie speaking. Jamie, where's Jack? Jack's not here, Ruth. Oh god no. Jamie, wilton and his friends came and this guy was hurt and they left and the beast murdered them. He's outside. - Hold on! Oh god, I'm so scared. Ruth, listen, lock the doors. Go hide somewhere. Jamie, come fast. Steven and I are here alone. We'll get out there soon as we can. Jack, this is Jamie. Come in, please, it's urgent. What is it, Jamie? I just got a call from Ruth. She says the creature attacked some men over at her house. Damn, we're out here in jarrettsville. Listen, I can use the dirt bike and get over there in about five minutes. Good, and Jamie, be careful. Right. Oh no, Steven, krebs is still upstairs. Well, I just game him a sedative. He's out cold in the examining room. We better try to get him. Oh my god, oh my god, we're gonna die. It's gone. I'm gonna go take a look. Steven, no. It might still be there. Shh, don't worry, I'll be careful. It's still up there. I don't think it saw me. Steven, what are we gonna do? Ruth, I've got an idea. You stay right here. Steven, what are you going to do? Just stay here and be quiet. It worked. Thank god, it worked! Jamie! Jamie, thank god you're here. The thing dragged wilton away. I think he was dead. His arm was cut off. We tried to clean up out here, but we've been nervous wrecks. We better get these other bodies inside. That's right. They may lure the thing back here. Doc! God! We were checking all the houses, doc, and we found her like this. I'm sorry, Jamie, there was nothing that could be done. You're sure it wasn't the creature. No, she was strangled. Jamie, I'm sorry. I just can't imagine who could do something like this. I can. Jack, there's something on the road! It's a body. Oh god. Come on, come on, you can make it. Come on. Jack, oh my god! Keep going, Lisa, keep going! Lisa. Ow, my leg. I hurt it bad. Can you get me to the doc's house, quick? Let's go to my house, it's closer. I don't care where we go, just get me somewhere. Let's go. There we go, let's get you comfortable. Thanks, Lisa. Hey, wait a minute, what are you doing? I've got to see the injury if I'm gonna patch it up. Yeah, I know, but... Are you embarrassed, Jack? No, of course not. Good, let's get these pants off. You'll be fixed up in no time. That's a nasty gash you have here. I know. Let me get some alcohol and cotton. Be right back. Thanks, Lisa. My pleasure. Now you lie back and rest for a while. What are you doing? I'm gonna get a shower and get a clean uniform. This one's a mess. I'll just... Stay right here. Get comfy, I'll be right back. All right. Hi, how's your leg? Oh, hi. Better. Good. Guess I better get dressed now, huh? No. You know you're a very attractive girl, Lisa. I guess I never really noticed before. You never gave it a chance before. I'm willing to give it a chance now. Can I get this shirt off? If I can take this towel off. Bertie, I want another drink! What are you doing up here? I want another drink, bertie. You don't need another drink. You're drunk already. Maybe I oughta call the governor or something. Apologize. Bertie. Ow! Are you gonna get me another drink? All right! Anything you want. You want another drink, I'll get you another drink. I'll get you two drinks. I'll get you four drinks. Anything you want, just don't call me bertie! You know, bertie, I was thinking. Maybe you oughta write the governor a letter of apology. Or maybe you oughta hire a writer to write it for you. That's what politicians do, don't they? I wonder who that could be. Maybe it's the governor come back to say he's not mad. Oh, it's Steven. Hey, bertie, Steven's here. Mary Jane, why are you still here? Hello, Steven, my good old friend. Come in on, have a little drink with us! You're drunk, Mary Jane. Where's Bert? Bertie's out here on the sofa. Bertie's right here, see? Hey, bertie, Steven came to have a little drink with us. Oh my god, he's passed out. Damn it, Mary Jane! Why aren't you two out of town? Don't you realize you're in danger here? Everybody else is gone. But you're still here, Steven. And so is bertie, and so am I. We can have a little party, just the three of us. Mary Jane, I just want you to get your things together and let me take you to the sheriff's office. You'll be safe there. Steven, I want you to sit right here next to me. We'll have a lotta fun. Right, bertie? Sheriff's office, Perry hill. Jack, it's Steven. I'm over at the mayor's house. He and Mary Jane are still here. Still there? Yeah, and they're both drunk out of their gourds. Bert's wiped out and Mary Jane's not far behind, and I can't reason with her, Jack. Okay, listen. Get back to your place and help Ruth pack the equipment. Lisa and I will come out there and take care of them. All right, but I wouldn't wait too long. They're really out of it. We're leaving right now. Okay, good. Mary Jane. Oh, there you are, Steven. I wondered where you went. I'm so glad you're back. Mary Jane, listen to me. Try to get your things together and wake Bert up. Jack and Lisa are coming out here to get you. Do you understand me? Are they gonna join the party too? I like Jack. He's a nice sheriff. Did you hear that, bertie? They're gonna come and join the party too. I give up. Mary Jane, just stay right there. Jack will be here soon. I've gotta go now. I think we're gonna have a great party. Now, I wonder where Steven went off too now. What was that? It must be Steven. Where is he? Steven, is that you? Steven, are you down there? Steven? Steven? You hoo, Steven? I know you are here. Are you hiding from me? I know you're hiding from me, Steven. I know where Stevie is. Mary. Mary Jane! What's wrong? Mary Jane? What, what, Mary Jane? Mary Jane! Mary Jane! Mary Jane, you down there? What's the matter? Mary Jane? Mary Jane. Where the hell, why the hell are you screaming? Bert. Bert. Mary Jane. Maybe they're gone. No, the car is in the driveway. And they're too drunk to go anywhere. Tell you what, you check upstairs and I'll check the basement. All right. Bert. Bert. Oh god. Jack, they're not upstairs. Jack, what is it? No, no, don't look. Why? Let's get outta here. Yes, we have an emergency situation here. Right. I would appreciate some state help. I can be reached here at the office. Right. Thank you. Wicker never even called the state. They don't even know we have a bad situation here! Damn! Jack, I'm willing to stick around and help out. Just say the word. I appreciate it, but there's no sense in any one else sticking their neck out. I'll wait here for the state people. Steven's packing the last of the equipment now, Jack. We should be ready in about 15 minutes. Good, Jamie and Lisa will go with you. Make sure you get out safely. Me? Yes, you. I want you out too. Hey, wait a minute, Jack? No arguments! Listen, I've been thinking. I hate this idea of us running out of town when... We're beaten, Jamie. Guns have no effect on that thing. Guns don't, I know that, but if we could hit that thing with 20,000 or 30,000 volts of electricity we might be able to stop it! That's right. It scared it away at our house. Where would we get that kind of voltage? We can get a coil down at the power station in Jessup. It could work. I'm willing to try it. Let's go get that coil. But what about Steven? We can't leave him alone. We'll set it up at your place, Ruth. We're the only people left in town. And since that thing feeds on human flesh... Of course. And it's been at my house before because of the bodies. It's the only logical place left for the creature to go. Let's get that coil and get the hell over there. Hey, Lisa, why don't you stay here and keep a watch out? Okay. It's locked. Check around the other side! Damn, this one's locked to. You think there might be another way? There might be a window around back. I'll check. All right, I'll work on this lock. Damn! Stand still! You got a lotta fight in you, don't you, deputy? Ah! Stop struggling! Stop struggling! Turn over like a good boy, cinder, and look at what I've got for you, asshole. Oh my god! Lisa, Lisa, are you all right? God, the poor girl. You sure you're okay? Did he do anything to you? No, no, he didn't get a chance. He heard you coming, I guess. Jack, I've got to get back to that coil. Okay, I'll be with you in a minute. Are you okay, Jamie? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Jack, we have to get her out of these clothes. Do you have a jacket or something? I have some street clothes in the trunk. I'll get them for you. You really paying your dues today, huh? You sure you're okay? Really, I'm fine, just a little roughed up. Is drago dead? Yeah, yeah, he is. Jack, I didn't realize, you're bleeding. Let me look at it. You can look at it later, Ruth. I've gotta go help, Jamie. Let's get outta those clothes. Thank you. I'm sure as hell glad you're here. Krebs is driving me nuts. Can you give us a hand here, Steven? Steven, are you all right? Yeah, what's up? Give us a hand. This baby might just knock off our strange visitor. What is this thing? It's an electrical coil. That son of a bitch is heavy. What does the coil do? It's like a huge battery. It stores an electrical charge. Yeah, and that sucker goes to 30,000 volts. Once you charge it up, you run lines from it. Anything touches the wires, zap. Ah, you're going to electrocute the creature. We'll hit him. Well, it's worth a shot. Ruth, where's the power box? Down in the basement, I'll show you. Jack, when I get this line in can you give me a hand running the wires? Sure, can you help keep watch? We want plenty advanced notice when that thing shows up. Sure, I'll help. Good, I'll go get krebs too. You ever use a gun, Steven? Shotgun. Good, I've got one for you. Terrific. Get a gun from Lisa. I want you to go about 100 feet outside the yard, on your left. How's it going? Almost tucked in. You can give that wire from the car a while. Right. Look, keep an eye on krebs. I will. And listen, if that thing does show up promise me you'll play it safe. Get the hell back in the yard. I'll be back in a hurry. Are you ready to start stringing those wires? It's gonna take us a while. Let's move. I think we'll string it between the pole and that tree. Okay. How are they doing with those wires? Don't worry. This isn't my idea of fun. Remember, if you see anything, fire the gun as a signal. You can count on it. Jack, do you mind if I go help keep watch? I guess not. But stay inside the fence, huh? Don't worry, I will. Steven, Steven! Oh my god, Steven! Get down! Steven, Steven, no, Steven! Steven! Steven! Oh, Steven! Oh, Steven! Oh god, Steven. Ruth, come on. No, we can't leave him there! Steven! Steven, no, Steven! Lisa, bring her up! Bring her up! Steven! Jack, you and Lisa gotta hold that thing off for a couple of minutes. Ruth, get inside by the power box and throw on the juice when I yell ou! You okay, Ruth? Come on, move, go, go, go! Listen, both of you, if this thing doesn't work we grab Ruth and get the hell out of here. Jack! Jamie, get clear for Christ's sake! I can't! It's pulling it loose. Hit it, Ruth, now! Jamie, no!
