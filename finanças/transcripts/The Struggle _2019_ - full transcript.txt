What I really need to be thinking about is my dad. You ain't told me nothing about him. Baby, there's nothing to tell. That was a long time ago. Okay a long time ago. I need to know something about him. His name was Robert. That's really all you need. I mean that's. Doesn't make any difference. He's not around. He's not helping us. So it's not important. It's important to me. Okay and how I feel. Maybe the way that I act is because I don't know who I am fully. Well what about me? I mean I've raised you. I've done the best that I can. You have. I got you. I just I need something. More than what I'm doing right now and I won't be able to go forward until I at least know something about him. He was a bad guy. You don't know need to him. He was just bad news, you know. He just came into my life at a bad time. Maybe he changed. No, hardly doubt that. We're good. It's like you feel about me already. What do you mean? You talking 'bout me being on the streets and stuff, but you don't know. Maybe he's different. That has nothing to do with you though. I raised you not to be in the streets. So whatever of his genes... I'm saying the way that you feel about me, is maybe also the way you feel about him. No. I'm just saying. No. So his name is Robert. That's it. Yeah. Yeah, I mean that's all. It was. It's just not important. Please believe me. Yeah, Ma. All right. Baby, don't be like that okay. I mean, I'm doing what I can. I'm gonna get us out of our situation.

All he wanted to do was run the streets when I was pregnant with you. Sorry ass. Why didn't you tell me, Ma? I didn't want him to have anything to do with you. You know, and I didn't want you to have anything to do with him. He put his hands on me, Tracey, when I was pregnant with you and I'd be damn if that was gonna happen to you. Also Tracey. I know you had to defend yourself from the pimp. We know you didn't do it. What are you talking about? Well, after Darnell tried to frame y'all, he went back to the store across the street. Saw some surveillance footage. So when y'all left the scene, he came over to finish the job, so he can take over the business. The nerve of you. I should shoot your ass right now.
