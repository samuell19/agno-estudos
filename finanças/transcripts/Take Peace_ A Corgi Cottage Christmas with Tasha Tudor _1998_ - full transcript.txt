"And she brought forth her firstborn son "And wrapped him in swaddling clothes "And laid him in a manger, "Because there was no room for them in the inn. And there were in the same country shepherds"... Woman, narrating: the life of author-illustrator Tasha Tudor is a window into a world that many of us have forgotten. It is a world far away from the modern Christmas, a world where magic is real and anything seems possible. Tasha Tudor has helped define Christmas as we know it, and it is through her many Christmas stories, illustrations, and imaginative traditions that we can reconnect to the wonder of childhood and find new meaning in the holiday season. The peace you can find here at corgi cottage is a gift that we can all have in our own lives. For as Tasha believes, there is no peace that cannot be found in the present moment. "Take peace." It is here, in the peaceful kingdom of vermont, that Tasha Tudor finds inspiration. The joys of each season are faithfully recorded in Tasha's work. And her favorite time of year is Christmas. Outside, the first snows of winter make corgi cottage look like a scene from one of Tasha's own Christmas cards. And inside, a cozy fire's lit, and all the exciting preparations have begun. We usually start Christmas in june, because we have a big chest up in the attic and we put our presents in it. And as I said, we start doing it in june or so 'cause it takes time to knit mittens and things of that sort. In other words, rome was not made in a day. And I don't believe in hurry. I like to do things slowly. Narrator: although Tasha does not believe in hurry, she is one of the most prolific author-illustrators of this century, and her favorite subject is Christmas. Tasha has illustrated many of the classic stories, as well as documented her own holiday traditions, in books such as "Snow before Christmas" And "Becky's Christmas." The depth of Tasha's affinity for Christmas is best seen in "Take joy!" An anthology of stories, poems, carols, and folklore. All the best love stories are here: "A child's Christmas in wales," "The fir tree," "'twas the night before Christmas," And of course, the story of the birth of jesus according to saint luke. "Take joy!" Also contains a delightful account of a Tudor family Christmas, and all the imaginative customs described here are still at the heart of a corgi cottage Christmas. [barking] mm. Go on. [barking] I think one of the nicest things about Christmas is the anticipation. Anticipation of anything is almost nicer than the reality. It many times works out that way. It gives you great pleasure to anticipate something nice. And sometimes you're not let down. It actually is nicer in the reality. I've had that happen several times in various incidents in my long life. [barking] maybe I waited too long. Ah, look at that. It's one of the most exciting celebrations of the year. Don't you remember when you were a child, it seemed an eternity from Christmas to Christmas. Then as you grow older, it goes so fast. And this Christmas is even faster than ever. Come on. Very quietly. Narrator: as Tasha describes in her book, "Advent calendar: a wreath of days," "For our family, advent is the beginning "Of the Christmas anticipation "And begins on the sixth day of december, "The birthdate of saint nicholas. "Greens are brought in to make the wreath and the garlands. "The house is filled with the cold, fresh scents "Of spruce and hemlock, "Tracked-in snow, drying mittens, "Wood smoke, and baking. All of it exemplifies happiness and home." Tasha: oh, to make a nice wreath, just make sure you make it full. And they're easy to do if you're making... Sort of a base with the long pieces of boxwood woven in and out of the wire...Frame. And then you add to it, you see, so it looks nice and fluttery. I make it so that it's ready the sixth of december, which is the birthday of saint nicholas. And that's when we have the dundee cake, which I made for you, but-- but I've done it always, so at least 50 or 60 years. Narrator: the tradition of making advent wreaths and calendars to count down the days until Christmas began in scandinavia, but Tasha helped popularize the custom in america. She began making advent calendars for her children and then found they were in demand among her publishers and readers. The calendars are full of surprises. Each door opened reveals another treasure of Tasha's imagination and takes us one day closer to Christmas day. These ribbons were used at my mother's wedding in 1890... I think it was '98. And they were used to mark off the pews for all the family servants. And I have saved them for all those years. I love the color. They don't make ribbons like this nowadays. And there it is. Now I'm going to hang it. It's always hung from this hook up here. ["Deck the halls" Plays] [bells chiming] narrator: after the advent wreath has been finished and the special dundee cake enjoyed, Tasha puts up the decorations. As she says, "It is impossible to describe the beautiful effect of firelight and candlelight glinting from the decorations and casting shadows on the whitewashed walls." And so, with the lighting of the advent wreath, Christmas has truly begun. Tasha: the advent wreath is pretty, is it not? Narrator: even those not familiar with Tasha Tudor have probably received one of her Christmas cards. She has been painting them every year since the 1940s, and she's helped change the way Christmas is depicted. Christmas cards in the forties were formal. In contrast, Tasha Tudor's Christmas cards are heartwarming portraits of her own family life. Her children, animals, love of nature, and Christmas customs are all captured in these beautiful cards. Tasha: when I was younger and had to work harder, I used to make about 15 Christmas cards a year, and then they'd choose 12 to print. And...It takes a long time to do them, you know. They're not done in the spur of a moment. I usually had a baby on my lap to just make it interesting. The baby's now grown up and out in the kitchen fixing lunch. [bells chiming] I used to use my children in my Christmas cards and made them serve as models. I used to be able to get the girls to do it from vanity, but the boys I had to bribe with chocolate. It was great fun. I learned a lot about drawing childhood anatomy in that way. The face is very important, to have the faces just right in anything you do. Narrator: another important element in Tasha's work is the masterful blending of reality with fantasy, the core of life at corgi cottage. While the Tudor family opens their stockings in front of Tasha's fireplace, beneath the floorboards, a family of mice celebrate around their own miniature Christmas tree. I love winter because it's the best time to paint, especially when you get snowed in. And, uh, no one can come and disturb you. And it's much easier to paint snow than it is greens. I think green things are the hardest things I know to paint and make them look real. Narrator: the serenity of the winterscape of corgi cottage often inspires Tasha to do some of her best work. When the snow measures over 3 feet and envelopes everything in a soft beauty, Tasha often turns to her palette to capture the delicate light and ethereal quality of snow. [children laughing] "Snow before Christmas" Was Tasha's first Christmas book. Bethany, seth, and muffin are preparing for Christmas when it begins to snow, and their new england home is magically transformed into a land of wonder. Sledding, snowball fights, snow horses. Like all of Tasha's work, this charming tale evokes the delights of childhood and helps all of us remember the excitement of a snowfall before Christmas. Tasha: the first snow is always a very delightful happening, and it makes me think of a little book, and it has a beautiful illustration of a first snow, and I always think of that picture now when I step out. But I like the smell of snow. Snow has a definite smell. It smells like apple blossoms, oddly enough. Usually you can tell when snow's coming from the smell in the air. And the birds make beautiful patterns like lace in the snow. And also I like it, the tracks in the snow, 'cause I can keep tabs and see what the dogs have been doing, where they go when they go out in the morning, and so forth and so on. But I love snow. I love winter. It's such a nice quiet time. There isn't the urgency of spring or summer or autumn to get a garden...Weeded or carrots put in the cellar, and so forth. So it's a very peaceful time. No wonder animals hibernate, 'cause I think I'd like to hibernate in winter. I get up much later in winter than I do in summer. Narrator: although Tasha is well into her 80s, she regularly walks the mile to her post box, because sometimes the mail is her only connection to the outside world. Tasha is internationally famous for evoking simple pleasures in her work and way of life. And she's inspired a lot of fan mail. At Christmas, she's inundated with gifts, photographs, and letters from all of her kindred spirits. Corgis. Narrator: as anyone who knows Tasha is well aware, she's particularly fond of corgis, and one of her favorite creations is corgiville, which is inhabited by corgis, bogarts, rabbits, and cats. All of Tasha's sense of fun and mischief is captured in this advent calendar, which depicts the excitement of Christmas in corgiville. The beauty of creating your own world is you can make it exactly how you want it to be. The bogarts are great pranksters, and Christmas tree ornaments disappear from time to time, but for the most part, corgiville is a peaceful community and proof that all kinds of creatures can live happily together side by side. ♪ Love truly ♪ ♪ We'll try ♪ ♪ Love truly ♪ ♪ Love truly ♪ ♪ Let's all try ♪ Narrator: corgi cottage is situated in a remote part of rural vermont. It is 9 miles and at least 100 years away from the nearest town. Uh--uh--uh--uh--uh. Narrator: and although Tasha Tudor's life may look romantic and picture perfect, behind the scenes it's a lot of hard work. Aside from doing her daily chores, Tasha has to make time for all the seasonal activities, such as making gifts. Gift-giving is a tradition going back to the magi, who brought gold, frankincense, and myrrh to honor the birth of baby jesus. All of Tasha's gifts are crafted lovingly by hand, as she shares ralph waldo emerson's belief that "The only gift to give is a portion of thyself." She begins making her gifts almost as soon as the ornaments from the last Christmas have been put away. And many pleasurable evenings are spent dipping candles, knitting mittens, making animals for a creche, dolls' clothes, soap, stockings, and stuffed animals. Tasha: there are so many things I like to make. It's like a jack-of-all-trades and mistress of none. I never work on a schedule when I'm doing things. But I get--now, I made fred, who's sitting in my lap, and I'm inordinately proud of him. Is that right, fred? And I think he's very handsome. Narrator: Tasha's own favorite Christmas gift was a doll given to her by her mother, and this gift began Tasha's lifelong interest in making dolls and a miniature world that mirrors her own. Just as Tasha keeps her handmade gifts in a Christmas trunk, here you see her beloved doll emma hiding miniature clothes and mittens in the dolls' house attic. And of course, in the days preceding Christmas, emma, like Tasha, spends a great deal of time in the kitchen. At corgi cottage, the distinction between reality and imagination is often blurred. Nowhere is this seen more clearly than in the comparison between corgi cottage and the dolls' house. Can you tell which is Tasha's real kitchen and which belongs to emma? And my next thoughts after making presents is making dundee cakes and things and cookies which we can freeze, and I used to freeze them in the pantry. It was cold enough. But now I'm spoiled. I have a freezer in the cellar, and I put them in there, and they work very well. They still taste like proper cookies. Narrator: one of the easiest and quickest ways to evoke the spirit of Christmas is to make our own cookies. Nothing store bought will ever taste as good as the sugar cookies and gingerbread ornaments that we make in our own homes. I'm cutting out gingerbread, which we're going to frost and hang on the Christmas tree, which we do every year. The scent of the gingerbread mixed with moss and fir, which is what the tree is, is very evocative of Christmas. It's very curious how scents will bring back the scene, I think even purer than sight. And the smell of gingerbread and [indistinct] makes me think of Christmas. One year I made gingerbread for the white house Christmas tree, at the request of the president. They requested that I make some and I did. The gingerbreads really look very fine on the tree when they're all frosted. That's meant to be a branch, you see. Narrator: like everything she does, Tasha's cookies are works of art. She sketches corgis, mice, rabbits, and owls in the dough. But don't be intimidated. You can always use cookie cutters like the ones emma uses. It is a treasured afternoon in the Tudor household. For over 50 years, Tasha's family has gathered in the kitchen to decorate the gingerbread ornaments with icing eyes, scales, and feathers. Tasha's 4 children are grown up now. But her son tom always makes sure he's home to participate in this annual ritual. Tom: as a child, I really looked forward to it. It was a lot of fun. And a very sticky process. And I was told it's very simple. Probably it's because my mother was much better at doing the... Well, look, the house is coming out good. Yeah, the more complicated ones. I don't know that we're going to have enough frosting. Narrator: there is so much to be done in the days leading up to Christmas, but no matter how busy she is, Tasha always takes a few minutes to enjoy afternoon tea. It may be cold and snowy outside, but inside her greenhouse, Tasha has created a miniature springtime. [indistinct conversation] narrator: even in the simple ritual of afternoon tea, Tasha Tudor's magic is in evidence. The more time you spend with Tasha Tudor at corgi cottage, the more you see how all the details of her life are woven into the stories and illustrations. "Becky's Christmas" Captures all the wonder and joy that a child experiences at Christmastime. And clearly, it is the story of Tasha's own family. [piano playing] "The next morning was december 24th. "It would be a busy day. "The largest and last door on the calendar could be opened, "And in the afternoon, they would go to the Christmas woods to get the tree." Christmas eve is filled with excitement. The Tudors get up especially early to do their chores. And just like becky, in the afternoon they go to cut down the Christmas tree. Many of us complain that Christmas seems to get earlier and earlier every year. People start putting up their trees as early as november, and somehow, the magic is lost. Come along. Take your time. Narrator: Tasha Tudor cuts down her tree the day before Christmas and only lights it once. And so this moment is always a special one to be savored. Heavens, no. Never bought a Christmas tree. We go out in the woods and get it. And besides, when you light a tree with candles, you have to have a very fresh one. And it's very difficult to burn a fresh tree. But if a tree is cut in september, you couldn't think of lighting it with candles. They go up like a polishing rag if flame hits them. I always pick the Christmas tree so there'll be no arguments. I don't like arguments. [indistinct conversation] Tasha: when I go out to get a tree, I like to get one that will be as symmetrical as possible. And my younger son tom is a genius at adding limbs and things here and there to trees to make them look beautiful. And seeing that it's christ's birthday, we always celebrate the birthday on the day, not the night before. I think Christmas, they've made it too commercial. But then, you know, all old ladies think what was past was better, do they not? Narrator: "It was always hard to decide what tree to take. "One was too tall, another too slim. "But dan found a perfect one by the wall, "And he and father cut it down and put it on the sledge. "The others brought along the left-over branches for decorations, and they returned to the house, "Mother and kitty on the sledge, "Becky astride brown dobbin, and father and the boys walking alongside." [indistinct chatter] that's not too heavy, harry? No, it's not. I think it's going to make a beautiful tree. It's gonna be beautiful. Narrator: "The tree was such a full-branched one "That it had to be brought to the side door, "How splendid it looked, "Even without its balls and candles. "And how good it smelled. "Becky just stood and looked at it "With shivers of pure joy tickling the back of her neck. Oh, Christmas was lovely." ♪ See amid the winter's snow ♪ ♪ Born for us on earth below ♪ ♪ See the gentle lamb appears ♪ ♪ Promised for eternal years ♪ Narrator: as night approaches, the first thing Tasha has to do is make sure her beloved menagerie is bedded down for the night. And in keeping with the spirit of the nativity story, the animals at corgi cottage are honored during the Christmas season. Tasha decorates the barn with evergreens and makes treats for all her animals. Hot mash for the hens, apples for the goats, bones for the corgis, and a catnip mouse for minou the cat. Even the wild birds are remembered when Tasha makes them balls of peanut butter, raisins, and chopped nuts. [birds chirping] Tasha has always had a particular fondness for her doves, and these beautiful white birds have special significance at Christmas. They are a universal symbol of peace on earth, and they have featured prominently in her depictions of Christmas. Come, lovely. Narrator: no Christmas eve at corgi cottage would be complete without a reading of "A night before Christmas." Tasha has illustrated two editions of this Christmas classic, and is currently working on a third version. Each Christmas Tasha's father would read "A night before Christmas," And she carried on this tradition with her own children, grandchildren, and local friends. "'twas the night before Christmas "And all through the house "Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. "The stockings are hung by the chimney with care "In hopes that saint nicholas soon would be there. "The children were nestled all snug in their beds, "While visions of sugarplums danced in their heads. "Mama in her kerchief and I in my cap "Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap. "When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, "I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. "Away to the window I flew like a flash, "Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. "The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow "Gave the luster of midday to objects below. "And what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer." Narrator: to Tasha, santa claus was never the portly gentleman portrayed in earlier editions of "A night before Christmas." Tasha: I always seem him as a very small creature, with pointed ears, never as a stately, elderly, fat gentleman at all. I've always believed in santa claus. And I believe I'm going back in time. I believe in lots of things that people think there aren't. Just as you can't see certain fairies and things, but I'm sure they're there. But if you saw them, something mysterious is always more magical. "And laying his finger aside of his nose "And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose. "He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, "And away they all flew, like the down on a thistle. "But I heard him exclaim 'ere he drove out of sight, 'happy Christmas to all and to all a good night.'" There he is. Narrator: Christmas eve is the one night of the year when we can all suspend our disbelief and believe in magic again, if only for a few moments. As we look out at the night sky for the star of bethlehem, or listen for the sound of a chuckle in the chimney, may we all be blessed with the feeling that magic is real and anything is possible. [bells chiming] narrator: Christmas morning. Tasha has her first present of the day. It is snowing. As Tasha says, there are few things as satisfying as the silence of cold and snow without and the warmth and happiness of Christmas within. The stockings are investigated at once, but the candies, spinning tops, and mittens are quickly put aside as the preparations for Christmas dinner begin. Tasha: now, for Christmas dinner I always roast the turkey in a tin kitchen, as it's called, which is an old-fashioned reflector oven that belonged to my grandmother. And it is the best. It's a truly roasted turkey. It's roasted on a spit. It's truly roasted, it's not baked, as you see. And wait till you taste it. She's been on since 7:00, so I think she's cooked. I've done more good for antique dealers who want to sell tin kitchens than one could count on the fingers of one hand, because people taste it and they immediately want to get a tin kitchen. But you have to have a fireplace, and I think you'll agree that you've never tasted a better turkey. But my scots nanny taught me how to cook mostly. And I've always loved cooking. I think it's a woman's-- one of her greatest attributes is to be able to cook well. Look at that! I pride myself on my bread and soup and certain things I make. And I'm quite boastful about it and purr of delight when I get compliments on it. My receipt book I made from a dummy. You can tell which are the most popular receipts because of the spatters on the pages. All my children learned to cook from it. But I treasure it. Narrator: these recipes, in Tasha's "Receipt book," As she calls it, have been handed down from generation to generation, and most recently they've been shared with her readers in "The Tasha Tudor cookbook." The gravy I'm making is made of... With water from the boiled gizzards. Narrator: many of our Christmas feasts had their origin in Tasha Tudor's kitchen. A traditional new england Christmas dinner in the Tudor household includes a turkey stuffed in the usual manner and rubbed with bacon fat, succotash made with corn and lima beans, cranberry jelly, blueberry pie, and of course, mashed potatoes with lots of butter. Tasha: oh, yes. Parrot: all right. Did you ever see so much stuff? Delicious. ["God rest ye merry gentlemen" Playing] Now, let's have some cranberry sauce. Narrator: the Christmas dinner that Tasha creates for her guests is as memorable as the feast in "A Christmas carol." It has a storybook quality, Christmas past and present all together in each delicious mouthful. And as Tasha says, the expectation of the Christmas tree and the presents only adds to the joyfulness of the occasion. Tasha: thank you, thank you. [glasses clink] oh, my first memory of Christmas was when I was a child in provincetown, massachusetts, and the children were never allowed to see the tree until the moment that it was lighted. And we always lighted our tree with candles. And I have all the ornaments that belonged to--in my family since 1858, and they're very big and very heavy and very beautiful. Narrator: after dinner, while the washing up is under way, Tasha and her son tom and her daughter bethany finish trimming the tree behind closed doors. ["O tannenbaum" Playing] for it is only when the music box begins to play that family and friends are admitted into the parlor to behold this wonderful spectacle. Tasha: I will never forget. That's the first memory of Christmas. The tree seemed to me absolutely towering high. It probably wasn't, but I was very small. And I've never forgotten the sensation of what an amazing thing. It seemed to go right straight up to heaven. ["Carol of the bells" Playing] the sound of the bells, if you ring those, I can see in the whole tree. And also the smell of certain cookies. Narrator: the attention to detail in Tasha's tree is evident also in emma's smaller version, capable of fooling the eye as to which is which. This moment, when the children enter the parlor and see the Christmas tree, is beautifully captured in "Becky's Christmas." "The music box began to play. "That was the Christmas all ready signal. "Mother stepped out first in order to watch becky "See her surprise. "Becky's hand was trembling with excitement "As she lifted the door latch "And stepped down the last step. She turned around. "There stood the beautiful tree, "A shine of balls and candles. "But beside it stood a dolls' house, "The most wonderful dolls' house imaginable. And it, too, was lighted by tiny candles." As you might expect, emma and captain thaddeus celebrate Christmas day just like the other, larger members of the Tudor household. They have their own miniature Christmas tree, and they send miniature Christmas cards via sparrow post. They decorate their house with greenery gathered from the woods and light an advent wreath hung with red ribbons, just like Tasha's. Emma and thaddeus also host a party for any visiting children. Well, every year when the children were growing up, they all had stuffed animals and dolls. I had two boys and two girls. And we felt they should have a Christmas party, too, but I had, really, I had plans to keep them amused while I was getting things ready for Christmas. So the dolls, a very particularly nice Christmas present, which kept them busy at the time that I needed to cook the dinner and get the tree up. Narrator: this enchanting tradition has also been captured in "A dolls' Christmas," A classic storybook that has been loved and treasured by generations of children. In "A dolls' Christmas," Two dolls called nicey and sethany invite other dolls, bears, and children to a miniature feast and a marionette show. "When everyone was assembled, the candles were blown out "And the play began. "It was 'little red riding hood.' "Everyone had the best time. "And when the play was over, "They all ate cookies and sang carols. "'i think,' said nicey, that Christmas "Is the most magic time in the year. "Not just for the pretty things you get, "But for the feeling inside you, of what a good place the world is to live in.'" And at the end of a wonderful day, it is time for the most memorable event or a corgi cottage Christmas. Earlier in the day, Tasha and tom headed off to the forest to prepare a surprise. And now, they invite us to join them in remembering the true importance of Christmas day. ♪ Silent night, holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm, all is bright ♪ ♪ 'round yon virgin, mother and child ♪ ♪ Holy infant so tender and mild ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ Tasha: "And she brought forth her firstborn son "And wrapped him in swaddling clothes "And laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn."

Wonder, excitement, joy, a belief in magic become things of the past. It is Tasha Tudor's ability to reawaken these feelings in even the most hardened cynic that is the secret to her significance. Tasha Tudor shows us the way back to the world of our imagination, a world where everything is possible and reality is anything we choose to believe in. And as Tasha approaches the winter of her long, creative, and joyful life that has brought so much pleasure to so many people, it is this quotation by fra giovanni that she says best sums up everything she believes in. It is these thoughts that are her final gift to us this Christmas. Tasha: "I salute you. "There is nothing I can give you that you have not, "But there is much that, while I cannot give, "You can take. "No heaven can come to us "Unless our hearts find rest in it today. "Take heaven. "No peace lies in the future, "Which is not hidden in this present instant. "Take peace. "The gloom of the world is but a shadow. "Behind it, yet within our reach is joy. "Take joy.
