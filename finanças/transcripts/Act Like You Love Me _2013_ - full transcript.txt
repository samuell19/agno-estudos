Okay, your ankles are ugly but I'm not sure that they're worth 250. You know, sometimes I wonder what these fools are thinking. I'm like, "Man, just take the money, please." We got other cases.

Got in with the wrong crowd and... she really only comes around when she needs money. But, you know, when my aunt died my mom felt guilty, so... we take care of her. So you're saying she's... bad news? No, I'm not saying that. She's a good person on the inside. She's just a little wild. Maybe a little wilder than us teeth people approve of.

Ooh, that's my spot. Ooh, gentle, gentle, gentle, baby. Hey, brother. Oh, hey-hey-hey, Susan, um... I need your opinion on this song I just wrote. You don't allow people to criticize your music and you said that music is subjective. Aye, just this one time I really need another ear. Okay, let me just tell Carlton I'm back. No-no-no-no. We need to do this right now, it can't wait. Okay, but I wanna shower. Don't worry, about it, man. I just need your ears not your body. Hey, listen, I'm sorry and I hope you know that I didn't mean to be... Dad... I thought you were... Yeah, well, uh, Chad. I saw him leave. He didn't look to happy. Yeah, well, I think I... screwed up. I scared him away. Yeah, well, you can be kind of intense, you know? Oh, yeah. No kidding. You really like this guy, huh? Ahh, it's complicated. Yeah, it's always complicated. You know. Especially with you, since, uh, whatever it was that happened with Jared. Oh, please, uhh... Whatever he did to you. Please don't mention his name. You carry it with you all the time. Well, dad, it's not every day that you lose the love of your life and your best friend at the same time. I know, I know. Yeah... Loss can be painful. But it's part of life. When we lost Ty... Well... I had to struggle through that pain, grief, guilt. I felt like I didn't protect him enough. That's why I was... well, so overprotective of both of you and your sister. But then, day came when I realized that, you know the past doesn't equal the future. I had to let you and your sister live your life. And you did. And the both of you... the both of you turned out to be such beautiful women. And I'm so proud of both of you. But let me tell you something, let me tell you something. Sometimes, you have to find the courage to work through the fear. Now I'm not talking about well, courage absent of fear. I'm talking about moving forward despite the fear, hm? I love you. Okay. Now, um, I saw... he was, uh... headed down the trail towards the point. Okay. Copy that. Good. I'm off the clock. What do you want? I don't want you to go. It's too late for that. Chad. I'm sorry. Sorry or really sorry? Really sorry? I don't know, what's the difference? Well, regular sorry means that you'd say whatever it took to get me to stay. No, not that one. Okay, really sorry would be you standing here and letting me say everything that I wanna say and not interrupting me at all. That one sounds kind of rough. I got a couple more miles to run. Okay... really sorry, really sorry. Okay. You're self-centered. You're obsessed with your work and you're judgmental. Guilty as charged. You brought me down here to pretend to be your boyfriend, to fool your family. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm working on the character, this little role you want me to play. But if we're gonna fool people into believing that we're a couple, two people that actually care for each other I'm not the person that's gotta do the acting. It's you. So why were you all over Larissa at the pool? Because I wanted to make you jealous. That's childish. This whole thing is childish. Look, Kelly, why not be honest with your family. It's obvious they love you to death. Be honest with yourself. You're so scared to lose somebody you won't let yourself care about anybody. Okay, you know what, this was a really terrible idea. I would have loved to have been here with you this weekend for real. It would have been nice to not have to act. Yeah, well... you won't have to act much longer. We'll tell everybody the truth after the party and be done with this. Okay. I'll meet you back at the house. I got a couple more miles to run. Mm-hm. - Hello? - Tianna, it's me. I'm having an emotional emergency. Can you talk? I'm working, but, I'll put you on speaker phone. Go ahead. He said I'm judgmental. Who? Chad. Well, you said I had a big butt, that's judgmental. He also said that I'm selfish and I hide behind my work. Here's my card. You are my client, okay, got it? Tianna! Um, okay, you want me to lie or do you want me to tell you the truth in love. Truth. Okay, well, you are kind of self-centered, but I love you. And, um, if you want my opinion if you're gonna give him a shot then give him a real shot. Okay, my money's waiting, so I gotta go. But Tianna... She gotta go, bye. Okay, listen, this is my card. Make sure... If you push that button one more time on that elevator, okay? That's my client. Now when he hit you, right, did you feel it in your back? Your neck, okay. Trust me, you felt it in your back and your neck. Okay, now you can take him. Call me, call me. Man, I'm just... I just, I don't know what happened. You know, I'm just like, I just basically, I'ma give up, you know? Carlton, where have you been, baby? I've been looking for you, Oh, my God. Russell played me one of the most beautiful songs and I want you to hear it because I wanna play it at the party. Honey-honey-honey, look, no offense. I've got so much bigger things to worry about than that, okay? Oh, bigger than us? Yes, it's bigger, than... Yes, way bigger... Not bigger than us. Look, um... I need your help, okay? Tell me again exactly what it is that you need me to do. Look, first thing I need you to do is trust me. Can you please trust me? I mean, don't you trust me? Look, everything I do is for us. All right, you gotta believe... yes, for us. All I want you to do, it's real simple. Maybe you can go up to your father and ask him if we can get a hold of that money a little earlier than we planned. You know, I know, I know he probably won't give us the whole thing but maybe he can give us maybe two, three hundred grand? But why do we need it now? I want to let it sit there and let it grow the way that my sister did it. She did it the right way. She did the right... look, when have you ever listened to your sister? I mean, this is us, this is what we do. We're a team, okay? And I need you to trust me. Please, tell me you trust me. Okay, I'll ask him. See, that's what I'm talking about, come here. And, you know, when you ask him you know, maybe you can, like, talk to him after the party when uh, he's got a little bit of liquor in his system. I'm... or anything close to it. This way he's in a good mood, okay? Okay. That's right, okay, all right. Come on. Now, come on, am I in your heart? Am I in your heart? I got it right here, tell me, come on. Yes, Carlton, you're still in my heart. Thank you. What... you know what, give me a hug. Show me love. All right, Mmm... I love you so much, all right? Kiss. Hey, ma... Ahh... So how long you gonna stay this time? Just a few days, you know, if it's okay. Oh, come on. As long as I have breath, you can be in this house. This is your home. Not if dad has anything to do with it. Your father loves you. He just doesn't agree with those ways. You know he never wanted you to leave. He wanted you to stay here. Yeah, to be a dentist. Come on, ma. You know I don't like digging in people mouths. You know, I was sick every day in dental school, every day. I know, I know. But that's all your father knew and he wanted the best for you. No, he choked the life out of me. Listen, we lost our son. And you are the only son we have. Now you don't understand that. You need to understand that. You will be the head of this household, this family. Mom, I lost a brother. I miss him. I love him but at some point my life had to go on. I was the one that had to leave the house to chase my dreams. Make my own money, hm? And how much of your trust fund do you have? Why is he so hard on me? Because he loves you. Because he wants you to learn responsibility. He wants you to be a man. Don't you understand, sweetheart, we worry about you. Whether or not you're losing everything gambling, or losing it on loose women, whores, we just don't even know. Be a man? Are you kidding me? He worked every day 24/7 trying to get his dental practice together. He didn't know any of my teachers. He didn't know anything I liked. He didn't even take me to a ball game, nothing. Now if that's being a man I want nothing to do with it. He sacrificed everything for you kids. But you know what, you're never gonna understand that until you have some children of your own. I guess. You should talk to him. Look how blessed we are. I don't wanna do this... Listen... Mmm... You handsome thing. I'm gonna go back and get ready for this party we're having, okay? Mom, can I ask you a question? Hm, yeah? Is it good to keep a secret to protect someone... who you love? Russell, you know the truth is only safe place. Okay. I smell the whiskey on you mom. You need to brush real good before dad smells it. You know, I can't tell you how delighted I am that you are all here today. 30 years ago today I was lucky enough to marry the most beautiful woman in the world. And she was crying then just like she's crying now. And then... to be celebrating the engagement of... my lovely, lovely daughter, Susan to Carlton on the same day, well, that's more than we could have imagined, isn't it darling? Yeah, so, so, oh, so... I thought to make this occasion especially memorable... that I would have... Come on, come-come-come-come-come-come. Whore. Yeah, whore. This Jezebel. Scarlet harlot woman. What are you doing at my house? What are you talking about, Harriet? Oh, I've seen you creeping around, just creeping through, going to see her. Peeking, I saw you. Harriet, I-I-I was... No-no-no-no, I know what you were doing. I know why you were going over there. 'Cause she's nothing but a... She's an artist. Oh.. so what! An artist. Show her Nancy. Look, you know... You know that the bible... No, listen, please. You know that the bible says that you need to turn the other cheek. And I am so sorry, if you could just forgive me Well, maybe... for being such a fool. Go easy on the Jack Daniels next time. Harriet... you've been drinking. Mommy, this is my day. Susan. What? She is embarrassed enough. Oh, really, Kelly? Well, maybe this day is really about you and your fake little boyfriend over here. Oh, yeah, you're an actor all right. You're really good. So pathetic that you brought him here just so you could show me up. It's a scam, he doesn't know anything about her. I found your cheat sheet, sister. You're such a loser. You're so pathetic that you had to pay somebodyto act like they loved you? Susan, how you gonna be talking to Kelly like that. You ain't got the right. Yeah, worry about your own skeletons. Matter of fact, you need to be worrying about your boy. Yeah, sleeping with Larissa, yeah, I've seen you. Oh, what, oh, please. What? Susan, that's absurd, he's lying. I would never, ever stoop to that level. Wait a minute, stoop to that level? You said, you were gonna leave Susan once you got her trust fund money so that you could pay off those bookies. And then we were gonna run away together. So that's a lie. That's right, that's when I did see you in Vegas with some roughnecks and they were loan sharks. Now, you ain't gonna treat my sister like that, man. I'll kill you. No, no, I got this son. I got it. Ah! Now get out the water and stand up. Beverage? To hell with this family. To hell with you. Oh, Lord. Certainly been eventful. Yeah, never a dull moment. Well, guess this is, uh... good-bye for awhile, huh? Come on, Russell, you know I don't like good-byes. Let's just say till next time. Well, I wanted to say that I'm sorry for being a brat and I hope that you can forgive me. And I hope that we can stay in touch 'cause I really need my family right now especially my big sister. That's what we are, we're a family. Mom... Don't miss any more meetings, okay? Promise. Trust me, she won't. I love you guys. Bye. Love you. Bye. Goodbye, sister Drive carefully. We will. Bye-bye. Good to meet you. Take care, Chad. Bye, Denzel. You sure you wanna take a cab? I mean, you can ride with me. Nah, you're probably sick and tired of me by now. No, you can keep that. Chad, please, I've put you through enough, take the money. Have you forgotten, I teach high school students. That little bit of drama in there, that's an everyday thing for me. And I told you I didn't do this job for that check. So... I guess this is good-bye. Nah... Till next time. Girl... Have you seen this video? My nieces love it. It's huge right now. It's huge. Tianna, I should have listened to you. Who is that? Yep, you should've listened. Who are you and what did you do with Kelly? So... Now that you're not acting why are you here? I found my motivation. Love. Okay, now, this is my second intervention. Y'all gonna have to start paying me my hourly rate. Ay, yi, yi. So, was I worth the wait? Every second. ♪ Welcome, welcome ♪
