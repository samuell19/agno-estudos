He says that l smiled at him, there in the woods... -What if it is true? -Why should it be true? Why did he shoot? They were already on their knees. Did you ever talk about that? No. Were you afraid of Jari? He once said that he was afraid of me. And you believed it? What if it is true? Did you always sleep in the car? The car was the only place where he felt safe, l think. How did you meet? lt was a long time ago. l don't really remember. THE LlTTLE THlEF Hey! Where're you goin'? -Where're you goin'? -Home. -Get in! -No. l'll take the bus. The bus? What's wrong with my wheels? -Get in! -No, l've got to go home. Come on! l'll buy you some coffee. Come on! -Do you live here? -About a hundred yards away. -What is this place? -l'll tell you about it some time. -Any calls? -What y'been up to? Screw it! Come on in! -Hello. -Screw the old man. -What d'ya think? -lt's OK. l designed it myself. Do you like music, too? 'll Capitano.' ls that a band? -Yeah, my band. -Oh! When were these pictures taken? Um...3 years ago. 3 years! -May l read it? -Sure, read! Are you on this photo? There. Move over. 'Grand larceny, driving without a license...' Jari's list of offences isn't particularly impressive. 'Car theft, car theft, car theft, misappropriation of motor vehicles, unlicensed driving, drunken driving, burglary, car theft, drunken driving', and so forth. To me, he seems like a rather untalented little thief. What do you think? He said that one day he would do something big. 'Possession of stolen goods, assaulting an officer, unlicensed driving...' -Have you been in jail? -Me? How could you think so?! Here you are. -Fuck, l'm not on it! -Don't swear, Jari! You're on it. -HALF my face! -lt can't be helped. -l want my money back. -That's impossible. You ordered the photo yourself! Jari, where are you off to? l'll call the police! Stop, Jari! Stop the car! Now l've got you, you little bastard! ls this what you were brought up for? Think about it, kid! THE DREAM And then there was Copenhagen... You were in exile there, too. What were you actually doing there? lt says something here about an abortion... We were just spending time there. You weren't doing anything, in other words... He liked it there because nobody there could hope for anything. No. Wonderful! Well, you did not have to hope. -''Har nogen set min shampoo?'' -''Bla-bla-bla-shampoo!'' Has anyone seen my shampoo? ln my dream l was lying in a gigantic room, and there was a hammock. l dreamt l was lying in the hammock and you were lying on my stomach. And you were a little baby... Y'know? A tiny, little baby. Look, Minna! -Was l this little in your dream? -What's this? -l can't take any more. -Cut it out! Shit, you're always bitching! -Fuck! -Where're we going? We just wander around, going nowhere! From pillar to post! Haven't we had fun here? Now we'll go to Amsterdam! -l can't take it. -What the fuck do you want, then? -l want to have a home. -Don't start that again. A home! -We're going to have a baby, Jari. -Huh? What'd you say? You're lying. -l thought you understood. -Fucking hell! Who the fuck told you to get knocked up? No way, no day! Get it? l don't want any goddam kids hanging around. -But you said you loved me. -l love you. And if you love me, you'll do as l say! l'm the captain. You're my soldier! Children, this is the Eskimo's special talisman, a tupilak. The Eskimo uses his tupilak if he wants to hurt someone. He sends out the tupilak to kill the enemy. Eskimos thought they could charm life into the tupilak, too. lt meant life or death to them. Here is a real tupilak, that was brought here from Greenland. l'll send it round. Look at it carefully. lf you had a little tupilak, you would be safe from the big tupilak, whose power was useless against it. Jari, give it back. Here is an Eskimo family, safe in their igloo. The evil tupilak tries to bore its way in through the ice, to the family On your knees, you little shit! You better not tell that l took it! On your knees! Beg for mercy! -Beg for mercy! -Mercy! Mercy... Head down! You little shit! SEPARATlON Minna! What the hell's with you? lt's a long time since you wrote. Too long. l told you not to mess with me, you dumb bitch! Don't you have any morals? l have made all my decisions in our best interest, and you don't even care enough to visit me. This makes me believe l've made a mistake about you. You should learn that l seldom make mistakes. That's why everyone here fears me. They know l always do what the situation demands. That's why l always win. You must also learn that work is not the meaning of life, that you can never live on hope. Remember how happy we were? Like the last time in Copenhagen... Remember? You sure as hell don't want to wreck what we built up together, do you? There's so much of you in it, too. l love you and trust you, that's why l have a job for you. lt's easy, just do as l say. A. Pull yourself together, and obey! B. Do what l told you earlier. C. Come here! And don't fuck up! You know what'll happen otherwise. Just do as l say, and everything will be cool. Miss you. Love you. Jari. Why the hell didn't you write? ls it too much to ask? l've tried. l can't. Something's wrong with me. l'm tired all the time. -lt's some kind of depression. -Horseshit! Don't you understand why l write to you? And how important it is for me to get an answer? Don't you see how important... There's no point in explaining it to you. What's important is what happens after this. l've planned everything. l quarrelled with my landlord last week, but the flat's awfully nice. lt even has a balcony. l know you're not living alone. l'll talk about that later. The flat is the first thing l ever owned. -My own flat. -Did you get the necklace through? The metal detector missed it. -lt's the one l bought in Copenhagen? -Yeah. You seem strange... When l get out, we'll start all over. A whole new life! We'll cut out the small-time stuff, do something big. Understand? l've planned it. Everything. Fuck him! He was here when l was born. He'll be here when l'm dead. But l won't die here. When l get out, everything'll be different. We'll do all the things we talked about in Copenhagen. Sound good to you? -C'mon, smile? -Sure. Stay cool! Hi, Jari! lt was fun seeing you again. You were the same as always. l was so nervous, l couldn't say what l wanted to say. The new flat is just great. l don't have to feel like l'm in the way. l bought a kettle yesterday and the welfare lady was pleased with me. She said l've begun to think independently. l have changed. You noticed, didn't you? Oh, shit! Some day, l've got to start thinking what l want to do with my life. l've almost always had fun with you. You're really the most unbelievable person l've met. But l'm frightened. l have nightmares every night, l dream of ending up in jail. l hope you believe me when l say that l have always loved you, and never betrayed you. We were really happy, sometimes. But now it feels as if l must begin making my own decisions. You mustn't be angry. But when you come out, we can't be together anymore. l need time to think about what l want to do. Don't be angry with me. ln some way, l still love you. Minna. Ahoy, you over there! ls it you or the food that smells so good? -What're you doing? -Frying a steak for you. -My sweet baby's frying me a steak! -Lay off! What's with you? You ought to know. Did you get bars for the windows? lf he climbs in through the balcony, all l've got is you to depend on. What the hell do you see in him? He plays with you like a toy... You do exactly as he says. And every day that passes, you loathe me more and more. You're afraid of him! Who is it? Who's there? -Pack your things. -Now? -Where are we going? -To Amsterdam. What do you mean? THE JOURNEY Don't look at them! -Where are we actually going? -You tanked the wrong gas! You never do as l say! l did exactly as you said. Thanks to you, we've gotta change cars! Where are we going? Only assholes know where they're going. Red, we go left. Black, we go right. Fucking shit! You've got a problem. You try to be like your goddam mother. Sitting and listening to some fucking opera. Fucking snobs. And YOU? Riding around this fucking country, nowhere near Amsterdam! -Letting those fucking cards decide! -l make the decisions! -What do you really want? -'What do you really want?' Go home and get some dude who'll put a ring on your finger! Shut up! Do you know how much l've counted on you? You're the only broad l've kept this long. You should be grateful! ls there anything you're missing? Huh? HUH? Red. We'll run away and never come back. THE GRAlN OF SAND Ahoy, you over there! Have you ever thought about eternity? Have you ever tried to? lt's terribly hard to understand, no matter how hard you try. ln school once, we read a story about eternity. There was a mountain in the ocean. lt was 1 ,000 kilometres wide, and 1 ,000 kilometres high, and 1 ,000 kilometres long. One day there came... And every thousand years, there came a bird, and cut his mouth on the mountain. Sharpened his beak, you mean. And when the mountain was all gone, then one second of eternity had passed. You open this, stick the cartridges in here, lock the bolt, cock the triggers, and shoot. Hey, what're you doing? You crazy bastard! Here's one cashier. Here's another. Here's the bank manager. Hold the gun right. Then shout: 'On your knees!' -On your knees! -Good! Then l move here... Then this dude turns up... Goddammit, don't ever do that! Hold the gun like this! Turn your head, not the shotgun! Anybody there? Anybody there? THE DECK OF CARDS Let's drive there and eat something. l'm starved. Party time! The 1 5-year-old who was murdered, had decided, before he died, to begin keeping a diary. His first entry reads.: 'Today l made a clay frog. l'm going to a dance on Saturday.' When you were at the dance... Did you see him? There were so many people there. l can't take any more. l want to go home. You're just like your goddam mother! Where are we going? -You choose. -Why? -We'll be happy, like in Copenhagen! -Sure, sure! G'night! -l really got scared. -Good! l'm sick of this. -What do you want to do? -Go back. Back? Hey, Jari! OK, let's take this one. -Somebody saw us! -Huh? Somebody saw us! -Don't you hear me? Someone saw us! -Jump on! Hey! They're following us! Run to the car! Wait! Give me the gun! Do as l say! Load it and give it to me! -Load the gun and come here! -What? Don't you hear?! You old bitch, let go! Stomp on the fingers! Minna! THE RABBlTS The rabbits! Stop! You're fucking crazy! Do something! Help me! Bring water! The bodies are lying at the edge of the graveyard's southern part. The gravel path here has fresh footprints on it. The man is lying flat on his back, half his skull is shattered. The boy is lying...let me see, now... The left half of the boy's head is shattered, parts of his brain are on the ground nearby. Buckshot can be observed in the brain matter. There is vomit in front of the boy's head, about 30 cm. in front of the body, which may indicate that the father was killed first, causing the boy to become nauseated. Hi, want a lift? Yeah, to Amsterdam. All the young people go there nowadays. lt is a nice place. l like it very much. How can you afford it? Where do you get the money? We work almost the whole year, then we travel, around, around... -lt is great fun, this life. -l can see that. First, make much money, then... Two Finns, a man and a woman in their 20's, are being sought by police as suspects in Sunday's triple murder in northern Sweden. At a press conference held by the police, the suspects were described as extremely dangerous. The couple is believed to be driving a black Volvo, licence no GZK 924. l repeat GZK 924. Police do not rule out that the pair may be bound for Norway. What a horrible story! What awful people! -What a nice dog you have. -lt seems as if you like animals. -Yeah, l like animals very much. -She likes you, l see. -All animals like me. -lt seems so. l even think like a dog. l'm an animal myself, you know, running in the woods. -You enjoy that? -Yes. So long! -Did anyone recognize you? -No. Where'd they get the pictures from? Where d'you think? Why d'you send them all over the place? What does it say about us? Well? lt says the boy was just 1 5. Fifteen? He said thirteen to me. 'Don't shoot me. l'm only 1 3.' Listen! They called your mother, and she said that you're not that kind. When you were little, you were... -What's 'svartsjuk'? -Jealous. You were jealous. When you didn't think you were getting enough attention from her, you'd knock her down and beat her with a cane. THE ESCAPE lf you're thinking of leaving, remember what l did to that old bitch. Understand? No shit! Get us a car! Why did you shoot them? lt's so stupid, stealing a bike and killing three people for it. Shut up! Whose idea was it to take the bike? Who said we should drive to just that town? Did you want to end up in jail, asshole? 'll capitano!' ls that who you are supposed to be? You can't even start up an outboard! Where will you go now? -l didn't shoot anybody. -What? You smiled at me in the woods, when l was sitting on the old bitch. -What're you getting at? -l'm finally beginning to see. -See what? -You always smiled at me. You're the captain, l do as you say. lt was you who made me kill them. Do you know what that means? lt means that YOU killed them. l've always been forced to be afraid of you. You made all the decisions. l've always been afraid of you. Always. On platform two, train from Copenhagen, arrival at 9.:30 a.m. Come on out! Just look at the camera. RECONSTRUCTlON Why, actually, did he shoot? They were already on their knees. Did you ever talk about that? No. The pastor is here to see you. l have some clothes for you. -We'll leave the door open. -Thanks. Hi. My name is Monica. How are you, Minna? Does it trouble you that Jari says you did it? Come along, here! -Hi. -Hi. You probably understand why we're here. We're going to reconstruct the whole episode. Those cardboard boxes represent gravestones, and we... lt'll look just as it actually did. The victims are outlined. Now you'll be the leading man and the director, you seem to have certain qualifications for it, and l'll present an old acquaintance to you. -One you surely recognize. -Yeah. -Do you care to... -l must think a little, first. Yes, that's a good idea. She holds the weapon like this, like l taught her, and then she cocks the trigger. Then when the man stands on this side, l mean this side, then suddenly... Minna runs over here, cocks the trigger and screams:'Mahan!' That means 'On your knees!' l am translating for them. Did they say anything? Yeah. The man says: 'We just want our bike back.' We just want our bike back. And l say, even though l am standing there: 'Take the bike! Go to hell!' And then... Then the young boy says: 'Don't shoot me. l'm only 1 3.' -Now you say. -Don't shoot me. l'm only 1 3. But he was 1 5. Then l come and l take the gun, and say: 'What the hell do you do?' And she says: 'What is done is done.' Minna! This, then, is the wound described in...item 1 8. The base of the skull is shattered inward, which means that there was tremendous force against the head and the temple here, and the blow came from behind. Almost directly behind. These slashes on the torso indicate that they were inflicted when the woman...when the woman was already dying of blood-loss, or was already dead. What are you thinking of, Minna? lt took such a long time to reach them. But she was already dead. There was nothing you could do. ls that why you feel guilty? He says that l smiled at him there, in the woods. -What if it is true? -Why should it be true? Because then l thought that... Now l am the captain, and he is the soldier. ls that all? There is nothing more. On the morning of July 3rd, 1 988, in a churchyard in a village in northern Sweden, three innocent people, a man, his wife and their 1 5-year-old son, were murdered. Hence this film.
