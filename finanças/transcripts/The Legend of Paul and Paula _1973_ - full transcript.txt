If someone had a short life, the world says they went much too early. If someone's had a long life, the world says they have to go surely. My girlfriend she is so fair, when I rose, she upped and left me. Don't wake her until she stirs, I've laid myself down in the shadow that's hers. For all things there is a time, to gather stones, to cast them away. To plant trees, to fell them one day, to love, to die and to fight. If someone had a short life... If someone's had a long life, the world says they have to go surely. For all things there is a time, to gather stones, to cast them away. To plant trees, to fell them one day, to love, to die, to live in peace and to fight. Don't wake her until she stirs all by herself... THE LEGEND OF PAUL AND PAULA I've laid myself down in the shadow that's hers. Hi. - Hi. ELEKTRA MOVIE THEATER Evening, Mrs. Paula. How about a trip into spring, a trip to the country, so to speak. I can't, Mr. Saft. I have to put my daughter to bed. And I've already got plans. - Doesn't matter. Maybe another time. All joking aside... Just say the word and Saft will be there for you. I'll take my leave. Go to sleep now. Go to sleep now! - No! Why do I always have to sleep? So you'll grow up to be pretty. - Why do I need to be pretty? So you can get a guy. - Why do I need a guy? Why? Why? Why's a banana bent? Go to sleep now! - No! Listen. Go to sleep now, and if you wake up early, you can get into bed with Mom. - Yeah. Rum-diddle-bum-diddle, the bagpipe sounds, today's the day we'll fool around. There'll be music all day, Ia-Di-da, just once a year is Mardi Gras. Look! Look at him there! Come on! Go out through the gate. Don't turn around and keep going straight. Till you reach my place. I'm already waiting there for you. Only for you. Hey! Man, how's it going? Watch where you're going, woman! Get out of the way! Let everyone else have a turn! For you. Dear lady, may I ask... Would you take my arm and let me escort you? I mean... May I consort... Escort you. Wanna go out with me? When and where? Am I Jesus? I'd say right now, huh? Business before pleasure, Ines! - Let her have her fun! While we work our asses off? Go to hell, woman! Gentlemen! Are you going to throw in the towel? We still have plenty of other prizes! We've got some great things here, terrific stuff! Man! Go on and scram then! You bunch of jerks! - Cut it out now! Shut up! Roll up! Roll up! - I'll have my way with all of you! Don't listen to the old hag! Roll up! Roll up! Get down from there! - Hands off! Sorry about before. But you see, people get... Life does strange things... I mean the carnival and all that. It can turn you into a skirt chaser. Good night. What was your instrument? Cello. And? Nothing. No talent. End of story. Doesn't it get cold here at night? All alone in that thing? It's not for you. This is an evening like silk... - Pesky ants! No, you must be mistaken. Ants go to sleep at night. But gnats don't! Then take my jacket. Maybe you're cold as well. Don't crease my dress! This is an evening like silk... - Go on... I meant it's so soft. Yes... What do you do when you're not seducing little girls? I go to school. Medicine? Yes... Well, kind of. What semester are you in, if you don't mind me asking. Sorry? What year are you in, or whatever it's called. - Final semester, almost. Already got a job? - It's in the bag. And? 800 marks starting pay. - Take-home? What else? And in a year's time it might be double. I've got good prospects. You're no fool, are you? Lovely! Marvelous! A memory you'll cherish forever! Congratulations and stand still! No! Back up! Keep going, right to the top of the steps. That's better. What's the matter? Young man, kiss the little woman while she still lets you! That's it. Go on! That's terrific! Hold that! We're short of beds, but... One word and I'll keep you in for a week or two. Thanks for everything, Professor. - OK. - I'll be seeing you. - No... You won't be seeing me. I don't ever want to see you here again. You made it the first time and this time as well. Just don't ask me what we've done to you. You weren't made to have 12 kids. Get that through your head. In any event, you won't make it a third time. That's certain. So start thinking about yourself and don't just get the pill, take it. - I will. I'll do everything you say, Professor. - Good. All right. Thanks again for everything. I'll be seeing you. All right. Take care, Paula. Mrs. Paula! You look fabulous! Never again! What a beautiful girl! Congratulations. She's just like you! Home already, Paula? What is it? A boy? Get out! Get out before I do you an injury! Don't stare at me! Scram! You can't do this to me! Think of all the good times we had! You know my health isn't the best. - Good enough for underage shrimps! Get out, you swine! You blond swine! While I almost died, you were screwing other women! Get out and never show your face here again! Take your shitty duds with you! Paula! Paula! - You bastard! Come on. Let me see the baby at least! Get lost! Get lost! You and your disgusting blond shaggy hair! Where's the boy? - Asleep. Quiet! Go ahead and file for divorce! I can fix you something to eat. I didn't want to do it with that guy. Want some coffee? It was fate. I couldn't help it. Three years in the army and so little leave. I couldn't handle it. You never mentioned three years. You never mentioned the army! I missed you, Paul! Shut up! Don't get upset, Paul. Was he here often? - No, never. How long have you known him? - I don't know him at all. What's that supposed to mean? I don't really know him at all. But Paul... We'll sell the old junk. Or just throw it away. I'll fix up the whole place. You'll be amazed. The kitchen and bathroom too? - Everything. And we'll go out dancing. People need to get out. And in summer we'll go swimming in the lake. And we'll go to the theater regularly. I've nothing to wear to the theater. Then we'll buy you something. Whatever you like. You'll be amazed, Ines. I'll work like a dog. And I'm looking forward to watching the boy grow. When he's older, he'll be a competitive athlete. It's good for one's character. Everything's just beginning now. Open up! Open up! Our socialist work is waiting for us! - Mine, too! Drink less and stop living off bottle deposits! Open up! It's ten after eight! Something's wrong here. - Shit! This can't be true, for God's sake! You're beautiful, honey! - Shut up! Come on, open up! - OK. I can't take that. - I bought it yesterday. Three bottles makes 90 pfennigs. Here. - Next, please. Out of the way! - The brewery doesn't take these. I bought it yesterday! - Two, four... I've been gypped! - Six... - Daylight robbery! - Seven! ANGELIQUE PART 2: THE ROAD TO VERSAILLES Hi. Hi. Hello, Mother-in-Law! I'm sorry. Why isn't the boy outside? - He hasn't got a scooter. And the one in the cellar? That old heap of junk! Right, Son? - Old heap of junk! Old heap of junk! Let's go outside. Leave him alone. It won't harm him. - It won't harm him! Come here, boy. Look. That's a real carnival ride! What's that? - A carnival ride? Roller coaster, merry-go-round, shooting gallery. Come on the swing with me, Luise... Roll up, everybody! It's a barrel of fun! Who wants to go again? - Me! Who hasn't had a go yet? - Me! Grandpa used to have a merry-go-round. Four merry-go-rounds and a ghost train. If only Grandpa still had them now. You could ride the merry-go-round every day. - Yay! That'd be great, Son, huh? But you can't, sweetie pie. Grandpa doesn't have his merry-go-round anymore. Bad people took it away from him... - For tax evasion and fraud! Be polite to my dad! - Shut up, you dumb broad! Paul... You can treat us any way you like. But I can't believe the way you speak to your wife. Going to bed at nine... There must be something else. Something other than sleeping and working. And sleeping and working again. I'm only 23. God! If only they wouldn't act as if you can't do without it. I manage pretty well without it. I could have the tire dealer. He's ready and willing. One word and he's mine. With a civil ceremony and church bells. No one would dump my coal in front of the building anymore. My kids would have a father at last. He's still in pretty good shape. And I'd have my peace and quiet. End of story. But I'll keep him waiting a while longer. And then... Ding-dong, ding-dong... bells are gonna chime. But first... But first, I'm gonna party. I'm gonna bop till I drop! I already know where. And I'm gonna do it right now! High upon the towers where the doves all live, when a storm is blowing you feel more than the wind. The whole house shakes softly and makes you feel oppressed, sometimes you're a stranger in this world, an alien at best. These times were not made for us to shut our eyes and doze, and vast open spaces are creeping dangerously close. Watch out! Watch out! Some people stay safely in a rut and cool their backsides, fearing every sword stroke they find a cozy place to hide. They want a candy-wrapper world where they can feel secure, when adventure comes a-knocking they quickly shut the door. These times were not made for us to shut our eyes and doze, and vast open spaces are creeping dangerously close. Watch out! Watch out! I'm Martin. Sometimes in my sleep I find a song that I forgot during the day. Sometimes I prefer to seek a quiet spot where I can sit without thought. Sometimes I finally understand the word that seemed much too faint before. Sometimes I understand this year when no more woods are in bloom. Here you are. Well... Enjoy yourself, brother. Congratulations. Taxi! This is how it'll look one day. Chic. You can't leave your kids alone any longer. Sorry? I mean your kids, they'll... They'll wake up and no one will be there. What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What... Will this work? - Anything's possible. You see? I'm totally crazy! What is it? - It's normal. You know it? Will it last long? - Hardly. How do you know when it's over? - You just know. Let's do this... We'll let it last as long as it lasts. We'll do nothing to help or hinder it. We won't ask each other dumb questions. Only our names. I'm Paula. - Paul. No, I have to go! My kids are screaming, they're hungry! My whole right side's dead! It's still asleep! Bye then! Bye. Thanks, Mr. Saft! Thanks! But in this weather? But we're still on for tonight? The birds will all be singing. The bells will all be ringing. The ducks will all be waddling. The geese will all be gabbling. The cuckoo will cry. Anything wrong? Nope! Good morning. - Good morning! Two... Four... Six... Anything's possible... Anything... And then: bang! Paula? Is something wrong? - No, why? Aren't you feeling well? - No, why? You're tipsy. Admit it! - From what? Paula, look at me. Are you having another kid? - Get outta here! Who from? If you only knew what happened earlier. Don't forget it. All hell's broken loose in there. What's up? - Nothing. You're not going on the checkout. We just can't manage. - On your heads be it! Everyone be quiet! Junior checkout: anyone under 30 come to me! In Berlin, in lovely Friedrichshain... 9 marks 42. ...sat an apple girl with plums and pie. And while she ate her tasty pie in bliss a dog filled up her basket with piss. Frieda, where are you from, where do you go? When will you return? Paul! Don't worry. When I cry, everything's OK. It's just that I thought it was over already. Your wife's very beautiful of course. I'll never be that beautiful. I just don't understand why you acted as if you hadn't seen a woman in years? I'm sorry. I won't pry anymore. My wife and I, we... We're already... I don't even know why my wife and I... If she finds out about us... But we have the boy and... She's just waiting for a reason to... I can't afford a divorce on my personnel record. There's no rule against it, but it just isn't done. They just tell me to get her in line, see? Ouch, don't crush I! - Me, me! Me too, right. What's up? - I thought it hurt. But, Paul. Oh, Paul. If only you knew how much I can take. And how much I've got to catch up. Listen. We can go to my place through the rear entrance. Serious music in these duds! On your head be it! I'll fall asleep, guaranteed. It's going to rain soon anyway. Let's go dancing! - No. Not here. Not between movements. OK. Your day pass is over. Paula, look... I'm thinking of the boy. I can't leave him all alone with those people. Besides... I'm very fond of him. See you tomorrow. - I can't. You can. Try to come. Not tomorrow. You'll come. I can only come after he goes to sleep, between 10 and 10.30 pm. And not tomorrow. Bye, Paula. Paula... You'll come. And how you'll come! Didn't you know I can cast spells? Just you wait! Now you can go. Quickly! I'm glad you came. "If you don't eat bread in bed, you don't know how the crumbs prickle.“ Grandpa always used to say that. - Him? Him. A sea dog, huh? No, he was a riverboat operator. Our whole family were riverboat operators. Riverboat operator: a river dog. I was born on the Elbe River on the "Paula“, a GOO-tonner. Well, almost. But 600 tons is true. And she was called “Paula." All the boats and women in our family were called Paula. And now? It's all over. No more men in the family, just girls. - And your father? I never saw him. Paul? Let's buy a barge. There are still some left. Where did you get all this? I work at the source. Hot, ain't it? You know why I prefer you without your shirt? Because you're so get-at-able. Close your eyes. Just a sec! But no mustard! I'm not hot enough for you. You said it. Something wrong? - Are we alone, Paula? Completely. The kids are asleep. And those musicians? What musicians? Oh, them. They can't see anything. OK... What was that stuff? The booze? Don't you know? Pear brandy. But it wasn't the brandy. For instance... You'll be with me in a sec. Go to her and let your kite fly. Go to her, for you don't live from money alone. We're sailing! It's lovely! We're sailing! It's just what I always wanted: to travel in a bed! Go to her and let your kite fly. Hey, hey, your kite. Hey, hey, hey, go to her. Hey, hey, your kite. Hey, hey, hey, just go to her. Go to her and let your kite fly... This is Paul, and I have a son too. That's pornography! - Look the other way. We have to turn around, Paula. Do you know this is the first time I've never wanted to turn around? Red is the color of love... That's an old ballad. Do you know it? My girl asked me what an inequality in math is. I thought I knew: 1 = 2. Hogwash! 1 is less than 2. That's an inequality. Everyone knows that. - I'm taller than you. Everyone can see that. - You're different to me. Thank God! What'd we do together otherwise? Be serious. Inequalities are... - I am serious. I'm very serious. Paul is different to Paula. Especially in certain places. Come here, Paul. Come quickly. I'm so alone. All alone. Don't leave me all alone. More. More! Don't let go. Billow like a sail so light. Soar like an elusive bird in flight. I am near and close akin. Ride my body like a wave. Glide like the wind, in the wind remain. Beat me like a winter gale. Ride my body like a wave. Glide like the wind, in the wind remain. Carry yourself. I am the sea... I'm staying with you! I'm staying with you! Man, it sure is hot. What are you doing here? Go on, scram! This is Mr. Paul. He lost his keys and stayed the night with us. That was nice of you, Miss. I'd better be going now. That's Michael's dad from across the street, who always curses. - Yeah! Where's my boot? Where's my boot? I don't know. Somewhere. What kind of work do you do? - Personal consultant. You can go, the coast's clear. Tomorrow? I don't know! OK. Whatever you like. I'll be here. - Yeah, yeah! Bye, Paula. Thanks. Good evening. - Good evening. Are you crazy? If you don't come... You can see I've got my hands full. Good evening. We worked our butts off to land this contract. We need foreign currency. Besides, I'm doing a Swahili course. An intensive course. One of us has to be able to speak it in three months. It's necessary. Will you dance with me? I'm still on duty. Will you come outside with me? Yes. You go ahead. It's nice here, isn't it? It's over, right? - What do you mean? It'll be going on for a while yet up there. You're right. Maybe I'm too... - Yeah, you're too... too... What you want won't work. And what do I want? All or nothing. - So what? We all have obligations to fulfil. No one can just do as they please. For the time being, that's the way things are. Can't we just be happy? Not at the expense of others. - Why not? I'm sorry. Will I see you again? Of course. We can stay friends. When are we going to the zoo? - What? You said we were going to the zoo. - I'm busy. You can see I'm busy! When you're finished? Can't you be quiet for once? No! No thought for others! You only think of yourselves. I might get sick one day! Real sick! My God, OK! Go to the movies. It'll be starting in a minute. We'll go to the 200 next Sunday. She works, doesn't say a thing. - Did she cry? I think she blames herself. - Nonsense. How is it her fault? - Excuse me. Did you tell her that? - I told her everything. What would you do if your... If you... - I'd kill myself. If that would do any good. - What good? Hey, Paula, baby! What's wrong with you? Paula... - Don't come round anymore, Paul. Take care. Wait, Paula. I can't see you... You were right, Paul. What I want can't work. What happened was to be expected. Paula, are you... Don't mix things up. Paula, open the door! This is superstition! How's life treating you, problem child? Everything OK? Nothing on the way? Will it stay that way? - I guess. Remember the little green pearls. They're your most precious pearls. They won't be important for me for much longer. - Why not? I'm getting married soon. - 80? All the more reason. He's an older man. Saft Tires. Horst, old man! How's it going? I'm listening. What's that? Radial tires? Never heard of them. Never saw one. Five of them? Seriously, I don't have any. Something else, Horst... I need two mixing faucets. Finnish. Don't give me... I don't have any. Not five anyway. OK. One's no use to me. Bathroom and kitchen. OK, five of my own tires. But keep it to yourself. This is it. I've no time to fix or enlarge it. The customers never give me a break. It'd be different if I had someone to leave it to. I mean a kid. Even a girl. Why not? Watch out! How many boys do you think would like to marry into a firm? It's worth a pile. If it weren't for the taxes and the lack of good help. So that's it, Mrs. Paula. It was great to see you. And maybe it was a nice change for you. If you need anything, just yell. I'll see to it. - OK. You just need the right connections. Yes. Bye. - Bye. What do you say, Birgit? - Bye. Bye. - Come on. Paula, open up! I know you're behind the door! OK, we'll talk like this. Can you hear me? OK, we'll talk like this. Can you hear me? No person can take this, let alone an animal! Tell me what I have to do to get you to talk to me. And that tire dealer... What's the idea? The man could be your father. Your grandpa, Paula! Don't kid yourself, Paula. I know you. You'll die with that man. He can't get it up anymore! Paula, this isn't about me! No, Paula... It is about me. I love you. Let's talk, Paula. What you're doing is totally absurd. Say something. Come to me, I'm free. I've forgotten salt and pepper. Where do I find them? I simply asked where I can find salt and pepper! Why can't I get a simple answer? Mrs. Paula! It's me, Saft! Morning, Paula baby. I'll get right to the point. I'm not a man of many words. I'm going to my place in the country. It's really just a summerhouse. But I thought it might be of interest to you. How about a swim? In the nude, of course. I know a nice spot. First we take the train, then it's a 30-minute walk. Mrs. Paula, I'm a simple man. I left school at 14, worked my way up. I can't put it any other way. You have to forget. Your aversion to cars too. Life goes on, believe me. Good. All right. But we're not quite ready yet. Come in for a minute. The living room? - Yes. What's this thing, Mom? It's a fireplace. You put wood in it and then it burns. It's very cozy. - This way. Wow, it's got everything. We'll stay here. The bedroom. I thought I'd let you furnish it. Anyway... I thought of you the whole time I was building it. I have no children. No family at all. I can close my business any time. I'm still healthy. We all have our dreams... We'd have a good life. It'll be ready in the fall. Maybe even in the summer. Then I'm going to have a swimming pool built, with a slide. But that isn't necessary. Not really, that's true. It would look show-offy. I wasn't bad at tennis back in the day. You should've seen me. I believe you. What I wanted to say, Mrs. Paula... You don't mind me calling you Mrs.? - No. It wouldn't be right to say Miss to a woman like you. And we've known each other a while now. What I wanted to say was... Let me call you Paula. Mom, I can dive head first! Learn to swim first. - A diver soon learns to swim. Really? Maybe you're right. Do you have a comb for her, dear? Sure, here you go. - Come here. Come on, Birgit. This speaks volumes. Paul, you should have said something. You've been absent for a whole week. Without giving a reason. In your position. If you'd said one word, we would've fixed things, but now... Your wife... You didn't treat her very nicely. The boy neither. True, she has no education, is no match for you intellectually. But whose fault is that? Hurry up, please. - I have to shave. And change my shirt. - You should've thought about that sooner. We have to bring you now. Poor Paul. Poor Paula. But Paul... That... That wasn't necessary. Really it wasn't. Hi, Dad. Look. But yours is better. - Because red bikes are faster. You don't need to get changed. You're very beautiful, Ines. Come on. Did you know I was coming? I did, yes. They called. Your colleague that was here, he said you were coming back. How nice. I owe you an explanation. That's not necessary, Paul. - Yes, it is. We all have our shortcomings. Right. And we have to forgive them. But Paul... Let's drink to your beauty, Ines. But Paul... Here's to you. Well, my little fool? Come on out of there! We'll do something completely different! Completely different: colleagues, teammates. Take care. Do you have a hatchet or an ax? An ax would be better. I must have an ax somewhere. Wonderful. Just a moment, please. Here's the ax, young man. Paula, I'm coming! Coming, Paula. No! No! No! Well, Paula? What's your older gentleman up to? - Selling tires as usual, what else? Apart from that? - I haven't the foggiest. I don't get it. Now I have Paul. - No! Paul is... Paul is Paul and Paula. So everything's OK. - That's right. I'm having Paul's baby. - What month? Third. - Despite the pill. The pill! I want the baby. Paula, I know what you're thinking. You blame yourself for your boy's accident. Not any more. Or you think you love your Paul and that he loves you. I don't just think it. - OK. Then be glad. You aren't a child anymore. Some things are impossible. You can't have everything. If you knew anything about philosophy, I would say: Ideals and reality never coincide. There's always a gap between them. Can't I have a child from the only man for me? Paula... You won't survive another childbirth. Is there no chance at all for me? Not even a tiny chance? Not even this much? I can't really say... Good. Then I'm going to have it. Paula didn't survive the birth of the child. Her love was as strong as death, and death did a terrible thing. My girlfriend she is so fair, when I rose, she upped and left me. Don't wake her until she stirs, I've laid myself down in the shadow that's hers. Don't wake her until she stirs all by herself, I've laid myself down in the shadow that's hers.
