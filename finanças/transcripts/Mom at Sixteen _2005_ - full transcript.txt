It's our first day, so you have to sign us in. I have to go? I have to go in person? They won't let me send a note? Look, I cannot do that, I've gotta get him to the babysitter, I've gotta get to work, I'm--Yes, I'm sure. It's the law. Are we above the law? No, we are not above the law, no.Are we above the law? Mom? What? I guess you don't want me to tell you that your shoes don't match. Oh, no. All right, all right, listen. Both of you listen up. Do not make a single plan for this weekend.

Go away! My mom already left. You need to call her and tell her to come back, because this is a school, not a night club. Does her mother let her come to school dressed that way? Oh, what a cute baby. What's his name? His name is Charley Michael Jeffries. I gave him a good, strong name, because we suspect he's gonna be a leader for world peace. May I hold him? Yeah, hold on a minute. Just turn your palms over. All right, there you go. There you go, little guy. That baby smell. I couldn't imagine starting over again. Oh, it's mid-life madness, believe me. I didn't even think I could get pregnant. But, I'm thrilled. We are thrilled. Can we go?Of course. Now, your schedule is printed out for you. If you get lost or need some help, you can just ask any one of the kids. Mom, Mom.Welcome to Bayview. Yeah, just getting your collar, that's all. Pull it out. Jacey, shoulders back. Have a great day. I love you. I can't believe we have to do this. Starting in the middle of the semester? How are we supposed to make friends? Wasn't my decision. None of it was my decision. Really?

Just-- just look around. They're there somewhere. Okay.How beautiful. How old is he?Five months. This is Mrs. Cooper, she's... she's the girls' guidance counselor... Hi....and also the health ed teacher. Hi.Donna, this is Mrs. Jeffries. She has two new students starting today-- Jacey, who's a junior, and Macy, who's a... Who's a freshman....is a freshman. Macy and Jacey? Lyrical, isn't it? Came to me in a dream. Okay. Oh, God. I am officially now late for work. Bye. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Okay, today we're gonna mix things up a little bit. I wanna switch the roles. I want you guys to be the teacher, and for me to be the student. And of course, as always, what is said in class... Stays in class. Okay, today I want you guys to teach me about friends with benefits. Yeah. Okay, teach me about it, what is it? It's just when you hook up with somebody. Hooking up, doing whatever you want with somebody, and there's no commitment. So, it's sexual activity without commitment. Okay, well, what-- what does hooking up mean? What does that mean? Getting some, yeah. But no strings attached. Is it full intercourse? Is it oral sex? Yeah, it depends on the girl, really. Okay, but if it's-- if mostly-- is hooking up is mostly oral sex, who goes first? Well, the girl. Okay, but then does the girl get some too, or is it just one way? What about the pressure? Do you guys feel pressure? Like, say you're in a click of girls, you know, or boys, and everyone is hooking up, so to speak. Do you feel, like, "Oh, well, if my friend is hooking up, but I don't really want to, I think I need to." The whole point is that there's no pressure behind anything. Most of the normal kids in this room have had sex. Okay, so if you're having-- let's go on the premise that you're having sex, 'cause that's what you tell me what's going on. Who is responsible for the protection? Who brings the condoms? The guy should. The guy should. Absolutely. No glove, no love. That's my motto. 'Cause this guy gets any, right? Yeah. Oh, oh, don't-- nah. The girls are only doing it because the guys want them to. I like that the girls can take as much initiative as the guys, like...Exactly. ...if I want some, I can be just like, hey, I got a condom, come on over. What about these sexual bracelets? These bracelets that you girls wear that.. Oh-ho-ho! We've got some right here. Okay, well, you-- tell me what they're about. Blue's oral sex, and I think pink's like-- And wait, does that mean that you'll do it, or that you're known to have done it already? You break it, you break it and they'll do it. And if a guy comes up and he breaks it...They break it? If he breaks it, then you have to do what the bracelet means. Except that you guys never do. I don't know how many of those things I snapped. You're wearing a black one, which means? Well, I'm just wearing it for fun, but like... Oh-ho, okay. But aren't you giving the impression to the people who are looking at your wrists that you are willing to have intercourse with them? They wanna think that they can. I'm not just gonna go sleep with anyone if they break my bracelets. Oh, come on now.Okay, all right. Thank you guys so much for being so open with me. We'll continue this next class. Bye. Thank you, Mrs. Cooper. Bye. Oh, hi. You're new, right? You're Jacey? Right. Are you okay? I... I didn't sleep well last night. Oh, a new baby in the house will do that. Bye. I met your mother and your little brother in the office this morning. Bye. He's so cute. I know my class is a pretty free-wheeling class, so I hope you feel safe to jump in. Thanks. All right, ladies, today we're gonna be focusing on the front crawl. We're gonna sort the lanes according to speed-- fastest down there, slowest in the big section over here. Now, focus on technique, okay? Get a good roll through your shoulders, and if you know how to bilateral breathe, do it, all right? We're gonna meet down on that side. Don't get into the water until I tell you to. [guys hooting, hollering, whistling] Thank you very much, gentlemen. Take it on outside. Take it outside. Lily, you know you gotta wear a one-piece. You're wearing a two-piece, why don't you sit down for the day, okay? Hey, did you hear about that Jacey girl? No? She used to go to Westbrook. I guess she just got out of, like, six months of rehab. No way. Apparently, she just left one day without telling anyone, boyfriend included, and now she shows up here? Westbrook's like, what, 40 minutes from here?I know. Why doesn't she just go back there? I'll get the skinny. Hi, I'm Gena. Hi. You must be pretty screwed up to change schools in the middle of your junior year.

All right, ladies, in the pool. Good job. Get your head in the water. In the water, and pull all the way through. Allison, pull all the way through! Werner, head down! You're gonna drown out there. All right, good. ♪♪ Hey, hold on. I'll call you back. Hey! Hi. Hey, uh, tell me, did you ever swim in competition? A long time ago. Yeah? Yeah, 'cause we-- a bunch of our strong swimmers graduated last year, and we could really use the help on the team. I don't really swim anymore. Oh. All right, well, call me, you know, if you have a change of heart. But yeah... 'cause swim team looks really good on a college application, and it gets you out of PE. We meet twice a week, and swim meets start in a couple weeks. Did I mention, they're really snappy swimsuits. I'll think about it. So this young girl, this child who still has braces on her teeth-- hi-- and is even too young to drive, by the way, she comes to my office today to tell me that she thinks she's pregnant. Wow. So this young girl who hasn't been to college, no less graduated high school, who sits home, and she watches cartoons all day, why can she have a baby, and I can't? Um... so what'd you say? Well, I convinced her to talk to her mother. She went to the doctor, she's not pregnant, by the way. But the point is, she could have a baby if she wanted to. Sandra? Yeah? Hi. Aren't you supposed to be studying for the SATs? 'Kay. No, no, no, now. Now would be a good time.Okay. Sorry, what's the point? The point is that they just don't seem to make the connection between having sex, that that can result in having babies. Honey, they don't want to listen to a sexy woman who's having sex with a sexy man to tell them that they can't have sex. This is very hard for me to be in a school with all these young girls who can get pregnant and I can't.Oh, damn, we gotta get dog food. I gave the last can to Bear this morning. Hello, are you listening to me? Yes. Come here. I-- I think if the in vitro doesn't work, we should reconsider adoption. What?And I'm calling the agency I can't go through that process again. You're telling me that you can go through that again? Well, we might have to, and I just wanna make sure that we have a backup plan so I don't have to watch you collapse again. Excuse me! You were just as wrecked as I was. You just won't show it. But I can recover. What are you saying? Are you saying I had a choice? What choice did I have, Bruce? What-- what choice did I have?!

Look, I just wanted to explain about yesterday, 'cause, um-- Look, I don't really care. Yeah, but you may not have understood what you saw. It's not that important. I'm... trying to get pregnant. And so, I'm doing in vitro fertilization, so I have these shots every day. And my husband, he normally gives me the shot, but he's been really busy, so... I'm hoping that this can just stay between you and me, okay? It's none of my business. Hey, are you still thinking about joining the swim team? Well, you know, just 'cause it's a cool way to know more kids and feel more part of the school. I gotta go to class. All right. What point is Mr. Holbart making when he says, "men and women have their place until death"? Jeff?That men and women play different roles and that they should stick to them? But he says earlier that women can do anything men can do. Still, just because they can, doesn't mean they should. Ew. Jacey? You have any insights to offer us? On what? On last night's reading. What was it again? "The Course of Gender", did you read the material? Not last night. Well, then you've just earned yourself a zero. I read it two years ago. James Holbart. And his short story following his essay, "The Lifespan of a Day". He looks at the concept of gender in today's world. He makes the assumption that after death, when souls gather, they meet on equal footing. His hypothesis is that there is no gender in heaven. That's correct. Don't forget, your analysis of one of the works of Shakespeare is due by Friday. Jacey, can I speak to you a minute? Yeah. Why are you in my class? What?Why are you in English II when you clearly belong in AP Literature? I've read your transcript. In the past two years, you've taken only honors classes. I just thought I'd take it easy this year, you know, and not push so hard.What do you think we'd have today if Mr. Shakespeare decided to take the easy way out? Mr. Shakespeare didn't have MTV and the Internet. He had no choice than to sit around and write about boys who wanna sleep with their mothers and kill their fathers. Does anyone here know anyone who's pregnant right now? Well... my boyfriend's sister got pregnant when she was 16. Yeah.Her parents had to support her and it was really hard for her. You guys, you know, you all hook up, and you speak about your friends with benefits. But do you discuss the responsibility that comes from having sex? There's things a girl can do, right? And if she's hooking up just for fun, she should be... It's not all on us to be careful who we're sleeping with, it's your guys' fault too. But don't you think kids are having sex younger and younger these days? Kids are scared to talk to their parents about it these days. And why do you feel like you can't speak to your parents more openly? Having sex is usually a secret, and you don't talk to your parents about that. My dad would freak out at me. If you got a girl pregnant, what would you want the next step to be? How would you go about that? Me, personally, I wouldn't turn my back on her. If you got a girl pregnant, how would you take care of it? Do you have the support to take care of it? If a girl I was with got pregnant, I'd just tell her to get an abortion. Just that easily, just have an abortion like that? Yeah.We don't get any say in the matter. Like, most chicks don't even tell the guy when they get an abortion. ...when the guy just walks away. I mean, my sister had an abortion because she was all alone. My mother kicked her out of the house. Miss Cooper. Miss Cooper, what's your take on abortion? What do you think? Well, um... the Supreme Court ruled on Roe Versus Wade giving a woman a right to choose. Yeah, but I-- I don't really care about the Supreme Court. What do you think? A woman has the right to choose still now. At the moment, that's being threatened. I think it's very important that--Let's say there's this woman who wants to have a baby, but she can't get pregnant. How do you think she'd feel about these girls casually aborting fetuses? I would imagine that she'd feel very badly about that. Okay, um...Oh, this is so dumb. You tell us to be honest with you, but you won't even be honest with us? Jacey, if you'd like to talk about something with me personally, we can do that after class. Ooh! It can't be as bad as you're making it sound. No, it is, this new girl, she is pushing me, and I do not know why.Honey, don't you think that probably has more to do with your hormones? Excuse me, my hormones? Don't make this just about me. I'm not going through all this just for myself, you know. Yes, you are. What do you mean? What, you don't want a baby? We're not in this together? I thought we both wanted a baby. We don't, that's not right? I just don't care where it comes from. Where are you coming from right now? We've been going through this process for over a year now. An adoption, two cycles of shots... Honey, honey....given twice a day? But if this is what we have to go through...Losing a baby through adoption and now you tell me you don't want it?If this is what we have to go through, is it still worth it?Yes, it is! Yes, it is, it is worth it! It's worth it, because I can feel something. I can feel something, Bob, I swear it's working. It's growing inside of me. I know it's gonna work this time, I know it. I burnt the chicken!It's just chicken. It is not just a chicken, Bob, look at it. Look, is this chicken? It's garbage now. It's fine.It is not fine, Bob! Everything is not fine. Come on... huh? Take you out for Mexican. Go by yourself, I don't wanna go. I went to take a migraine pill today, and to my enormous surprise, there were only two left. Last time I took a pill, I had half a bottle. What should I conclude from that? Don't look at me. I get high on life and s'mores. I love s'mores. Shut up! Excuse me, don't talk to your sister that way. What, so you're asking me if I took your drugs? First of all, I could get much better drugs at school. Second of all, tranquilizers don't exactly count as migraine medicine. So, you are taking drugs? I just said that I could get better drugs at school if I wanted. Boy, that's a great attitude, Jacey. Macy, if you turn that camera on, I swear to God, I will smash it. I was just going to my room to film my sorrow. What do you want from me? Do you have any idea what you're putting this family through?Whatever. You know, we did make a decision. Mm-mm, youmade a decision. No, no. No, no, no, no, no. That's not fair and you know it. We came to an agreement together. I'm keeping my half, I expect you to keep yours. I'm sick of lying about it. Well, what do you wanna do, tell everybody in the world? I didn't kill anyone, I just had a baby. Well, you know, keep taking drugs, okay?

I made it very clear that you all needed to be prepared by Friday--I'll go. Fine. Romeo and Juliet might have been very young, but that's what made their love so pure. They were victims of a natural passion that neither of them was prepared for. And their love was so strong and so deep. And then I believe that Juliet found out she was pregnant, and she knew it would screw up her whole family. So, she goes to tell Romeo, but she finds him dead. What she doesn't know is that he's only sleeping. But still, she feels... so lost and alone. She decides to take her life rather than live without the love that was the breath that sustained her. Tom! Okay, I want all the girls to stand up, please. Come on, girls, stand up. I think you all look lovely, but we have to say that almost every dress code in our book is being broken here. I mean, if you got it, might as well flaunt it. What do you guys think of the dress code? No one follows it. What do you think, it's-- it's limiting your Definitely, yeah. Look at my tattoos and my piercings. I wanna show them off.Okay. You can sit down, thank you very much. Do you realize that you are wearing outfits that trigger a response from the opposite sex? Well, I'm meaning to trigger a response. Is it? Yeah. But doesn't that trigger a slightly different response than, say, turtlenecks and a parka? Well, I can't-- I can't help that. I'm not gonna limit what I wanna wear just because guys are gonna look. And what about the influence that you get from watching TV, and MTV, and music videos, things like that? Just gives us ideas. Gives you ideas? If we see a video and everyone's having sex, then we're gonna start thinking about it. Yeah, so it makes you curious, it makes you wanna try it. I read this-- this quote that said women were like ovens, they're more slow to warm up, but men are like microwaves, you push one button and they're ready to go. Do you think that's pressing buttons? We see every day in the media role models dressing up in revealing clothing. So, how can you expect us not to dress like them? Well, what are the results of dressing like this or behaving like this? Okay, so you hook up, and then what happens after that? If we don't give it up, they don't like us. So what? So what if they don't like you? Find someone who's willing to wait. Like you did? Yeah, but why wait if you're in love? Yeah. I'm not gonna wait forever. I'm sorry, Tom, who were you just in the bathroom with? Okay, all right. You're a liar. Really? Okay... okay. Ask Gena. Okay. Rawr! Excuse me, did it hurt when you had your baby? Ohh! Okay, okay! That is not how we speak in this class. You were pregnant? That's not how this class works. How can you do this? Thank you very much. That was very inappropriate. Jacey? Jacey ♪♪ Excuse me, do you know where the admin building is? Thank you. Hi. Hi. Bye. I haven't heard from you in, like, eight months.

She's back. I'll call you later. Where have you been? Out. Yeah, I got that. Out where? Just out. Jacey! I've been up all night. I was scared to death. I had absolutely no idea where you were.

Jacey, you can't handle it? Jacey, I am the one who is up with the baby all night. I am the one who's working all day. And now, I've been up all night waiting for you. Wow, why don't you give yourself a break and stop being such a neurotic, controlling bitch? I'm sorry. Your baby needs you. Look, I-- I hate you too! You know what, I told Brad. And you'll be really happy to know that he totally blew me off! You were right. Oh, baby, I'm sorry. I don't need him! I don't need him and I don't need you! YouNo! You think you can do this all by yourself? Sure. All right. You give it a try. Here you go. Good luck. Come on, Macy. Look, I'm gonna take Macy to the dentist, and then I'm gonna buy her some sneakers, and then I'm gonna buy her some books, and then I'm gonna get my hair done.

Yes, signs. It is a scientific fact that signs are real. So, now what? We park in the back and put a curse on that jerk's car. By the way, is I just wanna know if you're gonna be passing them blue eyes and crazy to my kids.Oh, a little crazy is one thing. Your feet is a whole other story. What do you see? I mean, just tell me it's a boy. We implanted four embryos this time, right? Yeah. Mm. I know it sounds stupid, but I dreamed it was a boy. I mean, it's all right if it's more than one. We've been waiting for so long, that a readymade basketball team is fine. Unless it's eight to ten, all bets are off. Sorry, did I say something stupid? What, what is it? What do you see? I'm sorry, it doesn't look like any of the embryos have implanted. I don't understand. I've had morning sickness and everything. Well, we knew there'd be a small chance that none of the embryos would take. But this is the third time. You said that three times would give us the best chance. Sometimes there's no explanation why things don't work. We can start again, when you're ready. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. It's fine. Yeah. Aw, yeah. Atta boy! I'm gonna take Bear for a walk. You gonna be okay? Oh yeah, I'm fine. How 'bout you? Great, yeah. I mean, I got you, live in America. Doesn't get any better than this! All right, come on. Come on, Bear. Bear. Come on. Oh... Jacey! Hi. I'm sorry, I found your address in the phone book. I didn't know what else to do. Come in, come in. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother you, but... I didn't know if you'd be here or at school. It's Saturday. Right. Would you mind holding onto him? Oh, sure. He likes if you-- he likes if you pat his butt. Okay. Hello. I brought his formula. All I need would be purified water. Yeah, yeah, he's fine.Where's your mother? Oh, it doesn't matter. Um, I just... Ugh, my head, do you mind if I sit down for two seconds? Please, yeah, make yourself at home.Thanks. You want something to drink? No, no, I'm okay. Thank you. Hi. May I kiss your stomach? [blowing raspberry, baby giggling] Why do babies love that so much? Uh, Donna? You're so cute. Donna? Hi. Why is Jacey Jeffries asleep on our couch? And more to the point, what's her baby doing in your arms?She just showed up on the doorstep. She needs my help or something. Come on in. Have you called her parents? No, I haven't, but I will soon. Look, this is Charley. This is Coach Bob. He's so little. Yeah, they all start out this way, you know. You wanna hold him? Yeah. Charley. Say hi to Bob. Look. Hey. Yeah. Hi. You like that? Oh yeah, you like that. [Donna and Bob talking indistinctly] Look at him. Ohh... Oh, doo-doo-doo-doo, yeah. Big yawn. Ahh... He'll never have that. Hi. A dad to hold him and tell him about the world. This is a great room. I thought you didn't have a baby. We don't, we're still trying. Oh, but you got all this stuff. Well, we bought it when... We lost a baby. And we just kept it for whenever... well, for when we have one. You know, the first feeling I had when I was pregnant, it's like there were guppies swimming in my stomach. Did you feel the guppies? I've never been pregnant. Oh, but I thought you said you lost a baby. We were gonna adopt a baby, but the birth mother changed her mind at the last minute. Jacey, here. You know we have to call your mother. You know that, right?Yeah. Hi, big guy. Do you think we choose our parents? I don't know. I saw a psychic on TV once who said that little souls choose who to be born to before they even get here. Why would anyone choose me? Jacey, why are you here? I just need someone to talk to. I mean, my mom's making me pretend like this never happened, you know, like Charley isn't my son, and I should just go on with my life. But I can't do that, and she just won't even listen to me. I appreciate you bringing them home, Mrs. Cooper, but I know my daughter, and she is not prepared to mother a baby. Charley. What? His name is Charley. You keep calling him "the baby" like we don't know who he is or anything. Jacey, I think if anybody knows who he is, it's me. If Jacey tries to raise a child, she'll drop out of high school, she'll never go to college, she'll never have a life. It's just a different kind of life. Mrs. Cooper, come on. You're a teacher. You know what happens to children when they drop out of school. But there are other kinds of schools these days for young mothers. There's schools where they can go to their classes all day, and there's a full daycare program right there on campus. Excuse me, but you-- you don't have any children yet, do you, Mrs. Cooper? No. But I have counseled young girls for many years. And I feel honored that Jacey has trusted to come to me. I'm glad she trusted you. I am, trust is very important. I trusted Jacey. I trusted Jacey when she told me she wasn't having sex with Brad. Yes, she made a mistake. But the result of that mistake is a beautiful baby boy. You've all had five months to fall in love with him, with Charley. But now, I think Jacey needs to open up the discussion of her options. What options? Really, what options? I think we've exhausted all the options. Jacey, a baby can't thrive this way. A baby has to know who the mother is. I have nothing but admiration for what you have done. But right now, you have a daughter here who needs to find out what's best for her. And for you, and for Macy, and for Charley. I think I know what's best for my own child. And I think I know what's best for mine. Your child? All right. You gave birth to Charley, and in that sense, Jacey, you are his mother. But there's a heck of a lot more to mothering than that. Who stayed up with him for 48 hours when he had the croup? Who drove him around half the night, every night for two weeks when he was teething and couldn't sleep, and still got home and got you to school? Who came home in the middle of the day when the babysitter said he was spiking at a fever of 104, and it would not go down? Who rushed him to the emergency room and stayed with him for three hours and somehow managed to get over to that mall and pick you and your sister up at the appointed hour? That's what makes a mother. Are you prepared to do it? Hi, honey. The girls are in there. The girls? Aren't you here for the mothers group? I don't know if I'm in the right place. Well, you have a child. Yes... yes, I have a five-month-old son. Then you're in the right place. Legally, we're supposed to have the same rights that every mother in Massachusetts has, but that's totally not true. What do you mean? You can keep your baby as long as you can prove you can care for a kid. Support it, get a job, pay rent. But no teenager can do that. Exactly, which means if you wanna keep your baby and your parents don't want to help, you're totally screwed. I'm not sure who the father of my baby is. I know it's one of three guys, but I'm just not sure which one. God, I forget what it's like to be a normal teenager, you know? All my friends ditched me. Their parents say I'm a bad influence on them, which is so lame, 'cause they're all having sex too. So, I've decided, I'm giving the baby up for adoption. Really? Look at me. I can't be a mom. And all the guys I was with are way too immature to be fathers. I could never give my baby up and never see her again. Mm, I'm getting an open adoption. I get to see the baby sometimes. And they send me pictures and letters and stuff. And the parents are okay with that? They said they want me to be involved with the kid's life from the beginning, so that I'm not a big mystery. The kid will know I'm his birth mother, I just won't be the mom. So, you choose the parents. Yeah, you look through a booklet of couples who want a baby, you read about their families, you choose one, and they set it up. That's a little dressy for stir fry, isn't it? Just thought I'd spruce things up a little. You look great. Thank you. By the way, Dr. Landau called today. He wants to know if we wanna do another round of in vitro. Oh. Yeah. I told him that we were gonna let nature run its course, and I put our names on the adoption list again. You did? I realized we're gonna be great parents. It doesn't matter where he or she is from. So, tell me... think this stir fry can wait for a little while? Why? Really shouldn't eat before athletics, don't you think? I love you. I love you too. [knocking, Charley cooing] Oh, hold that thought. Hold that. I will be right back. All right, you're gonna stay right there, you're not gonna move. Yeah. Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? Um... I just-- I wanted to know if I can see him. Yeah, sure. Yeah? Great. Let's see... He's right there. He sorta looks like me. Especially in the eyes. That's his name? You know, my middle name's Charley. I know. Yeah. Yeah, that's the one thing my mom let me do, name him. She wanted to name him Casey. Jacey, Macy and Casey. Like putting a target on his back. Yeah... yeah. You think I could hold him? Yeah, sure. Hi, Charley. Oh, come here, big boy. Oh yeah. Is he okay? Bless you. Of course, yeah. Yeah? It's just a sneeze, he's got a little cold. I'll go get a tissue. Talk to him. He won't break. Hi, little guy. I'm-- I'm sorry I freaked out. It kinda caught me off guard. It's okay. Hi. God, he's so great. I was supposed to give him up for adoption, but I... I couldn't. I guess I didn't know it was possible to love someone so much. He's really ours. Brad! Mrs. Jeffries. What are you doing here? He came here to see his baby. Are you sure that's a good idea? Why not? This could get kinda painful, Brad. There's no way you're not going to get attached to a baby. And I assume you have no intention on raising Charley. Look, I'm 18. I have a right to see him. People have been doing this forever, right? Why not us? Why not you, what? Get married? Quit school? Give up all your dreams? Do this full time? And how are you gonna support a family? You don't have any skills. You would have to work two jobs just to subsist. Mom, this is not your decision to make. It's not my decision, but I think I'm part of the decision. Brad, do your parents know about this? Mom? Would you like me to talk to them? Mom, leave him alone! Hey, look, Jacey... Oh, it's all right. I'm gonna call you, okay, Jacey? Yeah. Jacey and I can make this work. Thank you. ♪♪ Jacey? Hi. What are you doing here? I just-- I just stopped by. I brought dinner... dinner. Uh... Hamburger and chips, that's all. This is Jasmine, my lab partner in biology. Hi.This is a friend from high school. Why don't you head in? I'll meet you inside. Thanks. We sort of have a lot of studying to do, I don't... No big deal. I'll see you around. I can give you a call or something. No. Look, you just-- you should have called, you know? It's no big deal. She's just a friend and stuff, she's not... How's the baby? The baby's fine. Yeah, well, about that? I talked to my parents. They totally freaked out.

It's just, right now, everything is-- my parents won't let me leave school. If it's mine... my parents will pay and stuff. Ifit's yours. Hello. Hello, attention. Ladies and gentlemen, hello, hi. Macy, what am I doing here? I asked you to come. Hello? I don't ask for much, so you decided to indulge me. Hi, everyone, can I have your attention, please? I'm here for Wednesday's open mic, because, well, we have a problem here at our school. Two more of our football players have been suspended from the team for sexual activity. On the bus, in our gyms, there have been 75 dress code violations so far this year. Okay, sit down, sit down. Sexual intercourse is happening here during school hours. Okay, all right. Well, you know what? I thought maybe you might like to hear... Hi. Can I borrow Charley? What's going on?I'll bring him right back. ...from one of your own peers, Miss Jacey Jeffries. I think I'm more nervous than you are. [Charley babbling, scattered "aww's"] Hi. My name is Jacey. Some of you guys know me. This is my baby boy. His name is Charley. I'm 16 years old, and I got pregnant when I was 15. It happened to me, and what I want you guys to know is that it can happen to you too. Okay, it can happen if it's your first time. It can happen if you love each other, and it can happen if you don't. It can happen if you think you're being careful. It can happen if you're not doing well in school, or it can happen if you have straight As. This is silly, me trying to tell you guys. I brought some friends with me, and they know something about this too, and I think it's really nice that you guys can meet them. My name is Trea, I'm 15, and I'm eight months pregnant. My mom kicked me out as soon as she found out, and my boyfriend doesn't think that the baby is his. So, I'm living with my grandmother right now. She says I can stay there until the baby's born, but then we gotta find our own place to live. My name's Maria, I'm 16 years old, and my son Miguel is nine months. I live with my mom and my two brothers. Miguel's father is not a part of our lives. He came the day Miguel was born, but we never saw him after that. It's hard. My mom helps me watch Miguel while I'm working, but she has a job too, and she gets tired. Hi, I'm Claire, and I'm 16. My daughter Mimi is five months old. I live with my boyfriend's parents, they help us. Basically, I go to school, and then I come home and I sit on the couch and watch TV with my daughter until my boyfriend comes home from his job. And then we go for a walk or something. Some people would say that having a baby is nothing special. They're wrong. Giving birth is always extraordinary. It's a miracle. It's the universe's way of saying that this world should continue. Man, I never thought it would happen to me. The world tells us that having sex is just part of our lives. And movies, magazines, TV, they all say the same thing. But the world lies to us, okay? Sex is a big responsibility, a responsibility that we're not ready for. Are we ready to have kids? We still are kids. I was really lucky. I have a mom who supported me and my son through the whole thing. I'm very grateful to her and I love her very much. I love you. When I first had Charley, I agonized over what was the right thing to do. Should I give him up for adoption? Should I go back to school and let my mom raise him? Should I get a job and put him in daycare? But I'm beginning to realize that... it's not about what's best for me. It's about what's best for my son. He says, "Look at the handsome boy. Who's the handsome boy?" Hi! Hi. What's this? I wasn't going to give it to you, but I made it for Charley when you were gonna give him away. Oh...It's not finished though. It's a rough cut. I'm still tweaking. What do you think? Look at the present. Here, you wanna play with him? Yeah. Say "hello, Aunt Macy." Hi! See you later. Hi, I'm Macy, Jacey's sister. I'm your aunt, Aunt Macy. After you're born, you're going to live with a new family, so I thought one day you might have questions about your original family and your birth mom, so I made you this. Hopefully, when you're older, your mom and dad will let you see it. This is Jacey and me when we were young. This is my mom. Round and round. And my dad, your grandpa. Surprise. This is what your mother looked like when you were inside her. Don't be frightened by her size, you don't come from fat people. She'll go back to normal when you come out. Macy! Cut it out! Macy, turn off the camera. Macy, stop it! This is your mother on her way to having you. Apparently, some degree of pain is involved in giving birth. Shut up! But I'm told the mothers don't care. One more. I can't do it! I only include this to show you how hard your birth mom, my sister, worked to have you. All moms love their babies. but I think yours love you more. She wouldn't take any drugs because she was worried you'd be all drugged out when you were born. By the way, that's your original grandmother coaching your original mom on. Oh my God, this is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. I love you already. ♪♪ Mom, do you have anything to say to your grandson? Oh, boy... I just wanna say that I love you. I love you, little guy. And I am very proud of my beautiful, beautiful brave daughter for making this decision to provide you with a family that can give you everything you deserve. This is the hardest decision that she'll ever have to make. It's hard on all of us. But she did it out of love. Sweetie, the woman from the agency is here. I know. I know. And now it's time for us to say goodbye to Charley. No, I can't say goodbye. No, he's my baby boy. Sweetheart, sweetheart. You have a beautiful couple out there who want to adopt Charley. We made this dec-- Mommy, I can't let him go. Darling, you are not ready to be a mother. You have told me that yourself. Months ago, we made this decision. But I can't give him up, Mommy. I can't say goodbye. Could you have done it? Could you have given me or Macy up for adoption? To total strangers. It's too hard. Listen to me. I tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna keep him. Really? Yep. We can keep him. Yeah, but listen, you are going back to high school. You hear me? Yes, ma'am. And you are going to college, do you hear me? Absolutely. And you are gonna go through with every dream you ever had for your life. Do you hear me?I hear-- yes. All right, all right.Loud and clear. Now, I... will raise Charley as if he were my own. Okay. All right? Come here, Macy. He's going to be my child. Do we understand, and do we agree? Yes? Those are the conditions, those are my conditions, those are the only conditions that I will do this under. Absolutely. Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby. [teacher shouting indistinctly, basketballs bouncing] Oh, sorry. Where's Bob?Back there. Okay, thanks. Hey. Hi. Way. Are you sure you wanna go through this again? Well, she says it's a totally different story this time. She says the mother's already signed the papers, she's made up her mind, but she does want an open audition. Are we okay with that?Fine. The father's already signed the papers. Is it a boy or girl? I forgot to ask. Get your stuff. All right. Hi, again. Hi. How are you?Hey. Scared. Yeah. I've been through everything with this girl. 'Kay.Everything is finalized. So-- so, when do we meet the mother? What hospital is she at? She's here now. And the baby's here too. She's ready to hand him over. Now? Really? Yes. Now? We can take our baby home today? Yeah, I'm a little amazed by this myself. But I'll go get them. Okay. Is this really happening? I think so. Jacey? Jacey? Hi. Maybe it's like the psychic said. Before he was born, I believe Charley chose me to be his birth mother, but he chose you guys to be his mom and dad. And to raise him. This is how it's supposed to happen. Is this for real? Oh, Charley. This is the hardest thing that I will ever do. I know. But I'm giving him to you because I do love him, and I want more for him. Is this okay? Yeah, it's the right thing. It is, it's the right thing. Oh, Jacey, thank you so much. Thank you. You'll always be a part of our family. Thank you. Thank you. Say hi to Coach Bob. I'm Charley Cooper, and I'm going into kindergarten. Uh-huh, and how do you feel about that? I'm happy, because I'm good at reading and numbers. Anything else new in your life? I got a baby sister last year. And where does she come from? Inside of my mommy's tummy. And where do you come from? Inside of my Jacey's tummy. Who's Jacey? Aw... Who am I, hm? She's my birth mother. And what is so special about Jacey? She helped me find my family. Anything else? I'm the only one who knows how much she loves me. How's that?
