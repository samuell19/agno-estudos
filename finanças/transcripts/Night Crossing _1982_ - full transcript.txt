- East Germany, August, 1961. A divided nation watches as its people stream across a boundary from east to west at the rate of 3,000 a day. The east German regime counters the mass exodus with an act that startles the world. Military engineers erect an enormous barrier isolating a nation of 17 million. It is designed not to keep enemies out, but to keep its own people in. The barricade of concrete and barbed wire cuts through villages and farmlands as it completely encircles the nation of east Germany. The border fences are equipped with silent alarms and automatically-firing machine guns. Beyond them is a corridor three-miles wide known as the east-west border zone. Movement within the zone is highly restricted. It is heavily patrolled and seeded with land mines. The entire area is designed to discourage escape to the west and it now works to near perfection. Today, only the very desperate dare to risk a crossing through the border zone, but east Germans continue to try. Some will succeed. No one knows how many will fail. This is the story of one attempt. - Sign right here. Thank you. Lukas! - Hello, papa, Mr. Wetzel, Mr. Strelzyk. - Lukas, why aren't you at school? - Great honor, papa. They excused Frederick and me to carry out this important mission for the Republic. Sign here. - We already condemned Herr Müller at work. - Well, sign again. Be twice as patriotic. - Wasting a student's time like this. - Wouldn't you know they'd honor me. Who else in the class has read everything that Müller ever wrote? - Shh. - It's all right, papa. Excuse me, ladies. The people condemned the traitor and the defector Horst Müller. Sign right here, please. That's right. Thank you, Mrs. Meier. Nothing like relaxing at the end of a hard day's work with good friends. Some small talk, a joke or two, a few laughs. - Should never have signed. - What's one more lie? - Instead of condemning Müller, we should be joining him. - I asked for small talk. - Talk, that's all we ever do. We're never gonna move. - Well, we've plenty of company. Mentally, every man in this room had his bags packed. - Man alone has a chance, but when there's a family-- - but, John, Lukas is ready. - Impatient. Finishes high school in a few months and then what? - Well, the army of course. He'll be sent to secure Russia's border on China. - A radical suggestion. Today we worked hard, hmm? We're tired. A little depressed. A little thirsty. Sunday we'll all be together for the picnic. We'll be rested. We can worry, plot, suffer. What do you think? - We've waited years. What's a few more days? Hello, Frank. - Papa. - How's school? - Math's okay. Science. The rest is-- - well, will it ever be different? - Government's change. Frank, we know how we feel and you can say it out loud to me or to your mother. But to nobody else. - Has it always been this way? - Since I can remember. - Gonna pick up your mother. She's shopping. - Oh, wait. - No, it's not worth fighting over. - I'm ashamed. You take it, please. Please. - Thank you. - Not "hello" or "how was work?" Or "did you have a nice day?" Just "what's for dinner?" Children only thinking of themselves. So what is for dinner? - And the gentle trade winds provide all the island's-- - you have schoolwork. - Grandmama! I learn more from television. - We are not supposed to watch west German television. - Everybody does. - Me too, but I don't have schoolwork. I baked those cakes for your supper. - Wish you lived here with us all the time, grandmama. - Don't flirt with me. - Sorry we're late. - Oh, cakes! - It's all right. Supper's not quite ready. - You'll spoil your supper. - Well, well, well. Honored by a visit from pretzel, eh? - Yes, mama. It's just such a relief every night to be home. - Hi. You have business in the border zone? - Just taking Karen home. - Sign this. - Here. - All right. Thank you, miss Neuhaus. Visitors must be out by 10:00 P.M. And you're not permitted beyond the Neuhaus farm. Go ahead. - Good night, Lukas. - Good night. - See you tomorrow. - Are they working late on the road? - No one advised us. - Unauthorized vehicle approaching. Run! - This way. Over here. Watch this wire. - Stop! - He's still alive, Sir. - Pick him up later. We have more important work here. - Hey, wait a minute. These are my old jeans. - They're too small for you. - Yeah, but they're too big for you. - They'll fit me too. I feel taller already. - Good morning. - Morning, lieutenant. Please. Please. Hans is the name. Hans. We are neighbors, Peter. Friends. You on your way to work? - Yes. - Your two assistants, I believe? - I have Günter Wetzel and Josef Keller, yes. - Ah, Josef Keller. An old friend. We were in school together. Now he works for you? - Yes, he's a damn good electrician. - And the families, they're close? - Yes. - The older boy Lukas, good friend of yours? - Yeah, we're in school together. The FDJ. - Lukas is very bright, very popular, a leader. You're one of his followers? - I don't know what you mean. Nothing to concern you. Good day. - Over here, Neil. - Frank. - Oh! Oh! Yeah! Give me that ball. - Look at her. Will that girl of mine ever grow up? - I hope not. - Ah, you spoil her. - We spoil each other. - Oh, I've got to stop! - Me too. - Here. Look at my boy! - He's floating away. - Next time I come over, I'll bring balloons for everybody and some paint for the adults. - The border police will think you're part of a plot. - They don't care what I bring in. Only what I take out. I wish you could bring us all back in your purse, mama. - It's almost big enough. - If you wanted, Elsie, you could come. - Everybody I care about is here. - Richard, come on. We're waiting. - Let me. - We shouldn't have come today. We're spoiling the picnic. - Look over here, Neil. - I wish there was something we could do. - If only we knew where he is, what's happened. - Police didn't tell you anything? - They just asked questions about Lukas. Who is friends are, what he reads. Oh, Doris, I'm afraid. - He'll be all right. You'll see. - "I'm tired of waiting and hoping. "Till we're together again in a better place. "Remember I love you all. "We, like the eagles, were born to be free. Lukas." - I found that in a copy of Horst Müller's poems on his bed. I knew he was desperate, but... I didn't do anything. - Josef Keller. Um, sorry to interrupt your little outing, but I have to ask Josef Keller and his family to come with us. Are they being arrested? - If you'll just go to the cars, we will explain. - Our things. - We'll take care of them. - I keep seeing those men today... Taking Josef, Magda, and the children. And we just stood there. - It isn't right. People weren't meant to live like this. - Lukas is dead. He tried to cross the border and was shot... Many times. They-- they showed me pictures. Magda. - They're so proud of what they've done. They have guns which don't need to be fired by a person. - Do you know... Why they're keeping Josef? - They blame us for what happened. We're bad parents. We killed Lukas. - Magda, you and the children come and stay with us. There's room. - No. Hmm. You're kind, but this is home. We'll stay here... Till Josef comes. - Those same stars are shining on people in Munich... Frankfurt and Cologne. - It's late. Come on in. - Doris, we have got to get out. Look at me. - I understand how you feel. Don't you feel the same? Would you want to live the rest of your life in a place where they'll do the same to you as they're doing to Magda? - Magda is where she is because of what Lukas did. - Lukas simply reached for what we all want. - But look at what he's done to that family. - You can't blame the boy. I blame the animals that killed him. I blame the pigs, bas-- - shh! - Set up automated guns and show pictures of the boy's shattered body! Yes, and I blame Josef, who preached freedom and escape. The only fault that Lukas ever had was that he listened and that he believed! - Then we're all to blame. Because we all talk about freedom and escape and we do nothing. Wait another year till Frank's old enough to try it on his own? Till they show you pictures of Frank with his body riddled with bullets? - Don't. Please don't. - Hey, listen, listen... I want it for us. But more than anything, I want it for the boys. I want to give them what should never have been taken away from them. Like Lukas said in his note. I want us all to be together in a better place. - I don't know yet. But there's a way. I'll find a way. You're crazy! We don't anything about it. - We can learn. I mean, compared with building an airplane or a helicopter, it's simple. Hot air is lighter than cold air. So we heat up the cold air in a big sack made out of cloth and logically, the sack will rise. - We build a burner. Easy. - No, it's not easy. Nothing's easy. But it is worth trying. - How much material to hold all that hot air? - Well, I think we could manage 1,000 to say 1,500 square yards. - That's too expensive. - I know. And that's why I've withdrawn all the cash from my savings. - Building something this big is going to take days, weeks, months! - But I'm an independent contractor and you work for me. So we steal the time. - You seem to have all the answers. People have always laughed at great ideas. - You want us to climb into a balloon and float away to west Germany? - Come on, it isn't funny to make jokes about going to the west. - They're not joking. - It's something we can get the materials to build and no one will be expecting it. It's so ridiculous. What, eight of us hanging up there? - These are the plans. We used various books, including Frank's physics book and a manual on the installation of gas appliances. - We'll need a bag that can hold 70,000 cubic feet of hot air. It'll take 1,250 square yards of material. - Will they sell you that much fabric? - Obviously we'll shop where nobody knows us. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes, we'll take that. - Uh, 1,250 square yards. - Gentlemen, if this is your idea of a joke-- No. I know it sounds like a lot, but we run a camping club and we need it to line the tents with. 1,250 square yards? Must be a very large club. - It is. With big tents. - While I don't have it all, but I'll give you what I have. - Günther, good evening. - Hello, Mrs. Roper. - Hi. You and Mr. Strelzyk have been shopping. - Yes, we have. - It's big. Can I help you? - No, no, no. - It's quite all right. We can manage. - Excuse me. - It's a rug. - Of course. It's that top Petra wanted for the bedroom. I can't wait to see it. - No, no, later. The children will be sleeping. We wouldn't want to wake them, would we? Good night. - Good night. - Well, then good night. - That woman never misses a thing. - Oh, she's only trying to be a good neighbor. - She also tries to be a good party member. She could be phoning the SSD right now. What is that papa? Is it for me? - No, it's-- And what took you so long? You didn't buy all that here in town, did you? No. Is it a rug papa? - Can you two just wait a minute? This is heavy. - Can I have it in my room, please? What are they doing, mama? - Uh-- - it's a surprise. - Yes, it's a surprise. Come on. Off to bed. Say good night. - Night-night. - Night-night. - Good night, Peter. Good night, Andreas. - Good night. * Should we hide all this? - Only if Petra gives us three short ones. It's taking her too long to give us the "all clear." - Wait. Wait. Here she comes. - Mrs. Roseler, she brought you this. - Oh. Oh, what is it? - Chicken broth. She noticed you didn't go to work yesterday or today, so she knew you were sick. - She notices too much. - She asked about the motor. I said what you told me to say, that you were using a compressor to do some work at home. I don't think she believed me. Someday she'll be at the door with the SSD. - Then we'll be gone. - Or out of the balloon business. - When do you think you'll be finished? - Tomorrow. [Muffled sewing machine whirring] It's finished. Now what? We test it. When? - Uh... Peter found a spot... With nobody around. Oh! My feet. So sore. I can hardly walk. What if it doesn't work? - We'll see. - I never thought you'd get this far with it. - You think we'll really try and go up in it? - Uh-huh. - It could go just high enough to crash, kill us all. - Mm-hmm. - Or suppose it catches fire... Or explodes. - We're just not getting any air inside! - And that's all the propane. - Damn. Maybe the burner isn't strong enough. - Yes, that's part of it, but there's something else. Come on, let's get out of here. Somehow we've got to inflate the balloon before we try to heat the air. You alright? - Yes. - No trouble between you and Peter? - No. - Lately he's been away so much at night and I know you're worried about something. - Peter and I are fine. Mama, do you ever think of applying to emigrate? Should I? - One never knows what's ahead. - Well, I'm not leaving Pößneck unless I have a better reason than I have now. - I'm going to win this game. Josef, we didn't know you were home. - Mr. Keller, this is an extremely powerful painkiller. - I hope so. - We've-- we've tried to be close to Magda and the children. - I appreciate whatever you did. - And, uh, as soon as you feel up to it, then I'll certainly be glad to have you back on the job. - I won't be working with you anymore and I think it's best if the two families don't see each other. Just tell yourself that Josef Keller has an incurable disease. Very contagious. When a man is in my condition, the only way he can be a friend is... Not to be a friend. - Yes. Thank you. - Good-bye. - Bye, Josef. - Peter. How are you? - Oh, I'm fine. Is this the same trailer? - Yes, I just added to the frame so that I can carry more equipment. - You work too hard. Early, late. I see you coming and going. You only have one life. It's too short. - Take time to enjoy a little. Come on, Tweedle. - You're taking too many chances. - It'll soon be over. - Peter-- - I know. Günther's waiting. That's enough. Cut the fan. - It's looking good, Peter. It really is. - Damn burner! Nothing goes right. We still don't have enough pressure. How do we fix it? - Another nozzle. I don't know. A different burner maybe. - You know, maybe with what we have to work with there's just no way. - There's a way. - Falling! I'm falling! - Petra! Petra! Petra, wake up! Petra! - Oh, my God! Oh, my babies! - Hold up. That was only a dream! - My babies! I have to see 'em! Let go! Oh, thank God they're all right. I'm not going to do it. - Petra. - We have nothing more to do with the balloon. - Petra-- - I want out of it. I want my children out of it. - I'm doing it for you and the children. - You listened to Peter-- - because he had an idea. A good idea. - A crazy idea! All right, all right. Let Peter go kill himself and his family or get arrested for this hopeless damn foolishness. - You've had a bad dream. - It's been a bad dream ever since you started. Sewing hours on end in the attic. The hiding and lying night after night. And I don't know whether you're gonna come home from the damn tests. I want--I want-- I want out. - You want to be with your mother? - I want to be alive. I want my babies alive. Günther, I want you alive. - Peter says there is no way-- - don't tell me what Peter says! I don't want to hear it. I'm not married to Peter. I love you. I want you to be your own man with your own dreams and your own risks. I'll be with you then. Günther, please? - I'll tell him tomorrow. It's Petra. She can't sleep at night. She has these bad dreams. - Oh, I know. It's the same with Doris, but we can't let bad dreams stop us. - If my children were older, maybe it would be easier, but they're babies. If things went wrong and then they were hurt or... Left orphans-- - but if you don't try, what chance have your children got? - Things are looking better. They're making Petra a controller at the factory. Her own office. 3.50 an hour. I'm sorry. - I'll move the equipment from your work room. - When you can. - The less we're seen together, the better. Because when we're gone, they'll question you. And the only way you'll be safe is if you can honestly say, "I don't know." - Peter... If it was just me-- - of course. Of course. Can you see the guard tower? - I don't want to see. - Look beyond then. Look into west Germany. - Seems so close, doesn't it? I'm sorry about the balloon. - I don't want to give it up. Without Günther? - The four of us could make it. Frank will help me. Have you told him? - No. It has to be all right with you first. - There are boys not much older than Frank ready to kill us if we don't make it. - Oh, yes, and if they hesitate, the automated guns will do it for them. Talk it over with him. You're sure? Even though you don't believe in the balloon? - I believe in you. - This is better. - Yes, you've been saying that for months. - Well, we've built five already. I think we do it better every time. - Well, maybe this is the one. - Yeah, let's hope so. - Check outside. More air, Doris. We're not getting enough. Tie it down, son! Got it, Frank? - I can't! - I can't! Papa! - Get out! Get out! - Come on. We still don't have enough flame. - There must be some way of increasing the gas pressure. Frank, come here. Help your mother. - It's almost full, papa. It's holding this time. - Watch your lines. - It's lifting! - Come on! Let's get Fitscher! - No, Frank. There's not enough gas. But it works! And tomorrow, we'll go. Oh, my God! I can't believe it! - That did it! She's up! - If I'd known you were coming, I would have at least made something special for the boys. - It was on the spur of the moment, mama. - And in any case, we can't stay. - No, there's school tomorrow. - Should be vacation. - Well, I hope we can get the whole family together for a meal. Bernard, Liesel, Oskar, and maybe even the Meisen cousins. What do you think? - Oh, we'll talk about that. - Speaking of family, you promised me that picture of you and papa. You really do want that? - I'm trying to make up a family album. - Well, when I have the time, I'll try to find it. - I know where it is. Doris. - I could have a copy made if you'd like it back. - No, you keep it. - It's getting late. Peter's so impatient. - But he's a good husband and a good father. - Mama... - Put those somewhere where your mother won't see them. Flares? What for? - Well, just in case we have an accident and we have to give a signal when we land. Where is she? - Um, she was scrubbing the bath tub when I last saw her. She's what? Oh, Doris, what are you doing? We're through with this place! We're finished. - When the police find out we're gone, they'll be in here and I won't have them saying I'm a bad housekeeper. - Come on. Come on. Boys are in the car. - Just pictures. I don't mind leaving the rest. I'm coming. - Quickly, love. All right, Frank, take this and replace the burner. Doris, Fitscher. - Come on. Wake up. Wake up. Quickly. - Come, come. We're going for a ride. - We're going to ride in that? - Doris, hurry! We're ready! Come on! Quickly! Okay, we're cutting. Don't worry, mama. Cast all them off. Go! - Hey, look at us! We did it! We did it! - It's about 300! 350 feet! Nearly 800 feet! Going up fast! 6,400 feet! 6,500! - A flashing light in the northeast, approximately two miles from here. - Must be the dampness. It's getting too wet. Are we alright? - Yes, we're trying to change the tank. There. That's it. Hand me that wrench, Frank, and check the line on your side. - No, it's no longer visible. Yes, Sir. - Gas is flowing, papa, but the pressure's way down. - Brace yourselves! We're coming down fast! Everybody all right? - Yes. - Uh-huh. - Yes. - Here, Fitscher, let me help you. Doris, easy. - Papa, the balloon! Papa! I can't-- - Frank, no! - Papa, it's getting away. - There's nothing we can do about that right now. Are you all right, Doris? Have you found everything? - Yes, I think so. - Frank, how long were we up there? - Uh, 34 minutes. We made it, didn't we? - Well, maybe. Look, stay here and look after your mother Fitscher. I'll take a look around. Oh, my God. - Papa! Papa! - Stand still. Don't move. Did we make it papa? - We're in the zone. There's wires everywhere. Step on one and the alarms will be set off. Probably mines as well. What do we do? - Wait here till daylight, then try and find our way back. All right, we'll go in single file. And watch out for wires everywhere. You go last, Frank. Careful. Fitscher. Stay by me. - Looks like... It's a balloon. - That must be Lobenstein. We'll have to risk it. Easy. Come on, Frank. Frank, keep up. Don't look back. - Whoever manned this is still in the zone. I want the entire area covered. Nothing is to be touched. Notify major Körner immediately. A tow truck. Papa, they found our car! - Oh, Peter! Oh, my God! - Come on. Take it easy. It just may be nothing. It may be nothing at all. Come on. Come on. - This is DDR 22-Z-8 DDR 22-Z-8. Request permission to land. - Landing granted in area 12. Be advised that everything on perimeter has been armed. Major. - Wait a minute. This is it. I think. Yeah, it's not far now. Come on, Frank. - I'm tired, mama. - You'll be all right. Attaboy. - There it is. - They haven't found it! - Hurry. Frank, get the cables off the battery quick. - Go lie down in the car, Fitscher. Go ahead. Barometer? - Yes, it's been converted so it can be used as an altimeter. The burner's quite ingenious. - All of it goes to the lab in Berlin. - Yes, major. They've located the place where the balloon first landed. - Come on, Fitscher. We're home. Nothing's changed. - We came so close! - Take it easy, Frank. - But it's not fair! - There's a lot of things we have to do yet. - My pills. I've lost my blood pressure pills. - Must have been when you dropped your purse. Be very difficult to trace. I wouldn't worry about it. What we do have to do is get a note to Frank's teacher saying that he's sick. Then we'll take Fitscher to the clinic. We'll say he's sick too. And while you're at the clinic, I'll take the note to school and drop by the bank and explain why you won't be in. Hello? - Oh, Peter! I tried to call you earlier. When I called the bank... - It's your mother. - They said that Doris hadn't been to work today. - Well, the boys aren't well. In fact, we're just about to take Fitscher to the clinic. - And I wondered if everything was all right with you and the children or what has happened. - It's nothing else, and they'll be fine. Doris will call you back later. - Sorry I'm keeping you awake. - It doesn't matter. - I'll go down to the living room. Maybe read. - It's all right. - It isn't. It isn't. I failed you and I failed the boys. - No, you didn't. So close. We were so close. - I know. - What if we-- if we'd come down a few miles away... Or even a half a mile, but... A few hundred feet? Why? Why couldn't I keep us in the air just a few seconds longer? - You did everything you could. - All my life... Things have come easily for me. Too easily, perhaps, but... Anything that I wanted to do... Or anything that I really wanted to do, then I was able to bring it off. Until, uh, this. I mean, it's the one-- it's the only important thing in my life. Couldn't do it. - Darling, you mustn't blame yourself. - Didn't make it. It feel helpless. God, I do. I feel hopeless. - Oh, no, no. Oh, God. - Uh... Is it all right? - Yes. Yes, of course it is. Sure. - Uh, Fitscher and I were talking. Papa, we really didn't do that badly. Did we? I mean, for our first try. We went up. And we came down. Nobody got hurt. We're here. Home. Safe. And we learned a lot. - We didn't make it. - All right. But we did fly. Papa-- papa, you put us up there. You--you got us away from all of this. - Yes, for a very short while. - Papa. You know if it hadn't been for that cloud getting the balloon wet and putting out the burner, we'd have made it. - Yeah. - And next time... We will. Next time... I've made us some back patches. Commander. Co-pilot. - Navigator. Steward. All over again. - The SSD is looking for us. You know they are. And they're not gonna stop until they find us. - But you won't let 'em find us, will you? - No. No. No. No, I won't. I will not let them find us. I will not. - Ah, Mr. Strelzyk. - Hello, Mrs. Roseler. - Peter. Is th... this a bad time? - No, no. There is no good time. Come on in. Doris and your boys all right? - Yes, they're fine. - I've missed Doris. - Peter! - Günther. - Mama, mama. - It's good to see you here. - Come on, little Peter. Is Peter coming over? - Come on. - What's the matter with Petra? - Her mother in west Berlin, she's very sick and, um, they wouldn't let Petra into the west to see her. I tried to get an authorization through her boss, through the party. - Eh, it sounds familiar. - Um... There was a rumor. A balloon was found at the border near Lobenstein. We were so close. Literally a few hundred feet. I'm building another one because the SSD is looking for us and we have to get out. Wish you'd come with us. - The balloon... It really worked? - Günther, you should have seen it. It was beautiful. And with you along, I know-- I know we could make it. I have bought a new car. I was afraid that the old Moskvitch would be recognized. I'll need a trailer hitch. - Bring it around this Saturday. - The knife, the watch, and the pliers are mass produced and the lab found no individualizing markings. The converted barometer is more special. We're running a check on all the stores in the Gera district that sell them. - And still we haven't located the pick-up point yet. - It's a very large area so heavily wooded. There are hundreds of spots that would be suitable. - Yes, but someone must have seen them. - But chooses not to come forward. - We know the amount of fuel they used. We know the approximate weight they lifted. We know the wind velocity and direction. I wonder how long they could have stayed up there. 30 minutes? 35? 40 at the most. But that restricts the search area considerably. Contact lieutenant Fehler. Tell him to use more men if necessary. - Yes, Sir. What about the material? - Now that's our best lead. We're checking a list of the stores that carry it. - The stores should all be alerted to report anyone trying to buy this fabric in any quantity. - And do you think they'll make another attempt? - They will. How's Petra's mother? - We don't hear. It's driving me crazy. You got a good deal on this car. It's in pretty nice shape for it's age. - Like me. Want another beer? - Not yet. Have you started building it yet? - No. Waiting to see how big I should make it. - Better make it for eight. I told Peter we'd go with him when they try again. - I knew you would. - You want to be with your mother, don't you? I'm not gonna be a delivery boy for the rest of my life. I'm a mechanic. A damn good one and I got a right to prove it. - There are other ways. Helicopters fly people out of Czechoslovakia. - How are we gonna get into Czechoslovakia? Sneak across that border with two little children? And even if we did, we don't have the money. They're charging 10-12,000 a run. - You really think we can do it? - I know we can. We have to. The police are gonna find this Strelzyks and when they do... We're locked into it. Well, I know you're scared. - It's not just for me. It's for all of us. - We have no choice. When? - As soon as we can get ready. - Okay. - No, I'm sorry. - They're all too bright. We need more. - 40 yards is not a bad start. - Thank God you're back. - We've been so worried. What is...what? - Here. Read this. - "The pictured items were left at the scene of a serious crime." - They're closing in. We don't have enough time. - It took Günther two weeks before and this one's almost twice as big. - We can sew day and night. - I can work longer hours and after that, I'll get sick for a few days. - There were two of them. About a year ago it was. They bought hundreds of square yards of material. Can you describe them? - The one who did all the talking was dark. About your height. How old was he? - Maybe, uh, 35. The other one was younger. Mid-20s. Fair and taller. - Could you possibly identify them from a photo? - Oh, yes. I'm sure I could. - Could you tell me why you need so much of this particular material? - Our group of young pioneers are making sleeping bags and there's nearly 100 of them. - I see. Just a minute. We are bringing the material down right away from the warehouse. Would you have a chair? - No, I'll just have a look around, if you don't mind. I know the SSD was on its way. And we still haven't got the material. Yesterday, five yards. Today, nothing. - Could you make the balloon smaller? - Yes, we could. It wouldn't carry eight people. - He's building another balloon. - Well, they got no material in Jena. - But he is getting it. A little here. A little there. Damn this man! And who is that younger man? He didn't make the first flight. But why? - When he makes his attempt-- - I'm stopping him before that. Call Fehler. I want that area where they landed first searched again. - Sir, it's been two months. A very rainy season. - I want it searched and I want special emergency precautions taken at every border station. Taffeta? - I don't have taffeta. - Thank you. [Conversation muffled by fan] - Petra, your turn. - Oh, give me him. Give me the boy. You have to sit on the ground. - Peter, you're right here with me. - Andreas goes here. Fitscher, you're around here between mama and Frank. Frank, you're here. - Put your hands inside. - Well, that's it. When? - Tomorrow. We're not testing it first? - We don't have the time. If the weather's good and the wind's right, then we go. - Here they are, major. They were found just a few feet from the point of impact. - What have you done about it? - When I wasn't able to contact you, major, I didn't take any action. - These pills should have been analyzed. The buyer identified. - Without the number. This may be a problem. Is this pharmacy open now? - I'm not sure. It's Saturday. - See that it is. Come on, driver. Hurry! - The forecast is cold and clear. - It looks fine. - Petra says, "come for dinner." For dinner? Fine. We're really going then? - We'll know for sure after we check the wind. Where are we going, mama? - We're going far, far away. A long ride... - No. A short one! - Propranolol. Prescribed for hypertension. High blood pressure. If had the number-- - I want the name. - We have to go through our entire prescription file. That'd still be ten-- - please try it. - On Monday when my staff is here-- - I would very much like you to do it now. - Becca Hudruf. Felderstraße 63. Ertman, Max. Karl-Marx, apartment number 23. - It's perfect. Gentle wind to the west. - Should we make one test before we risk it? - I'd like to. Haven't got time. Now let's get back. - Here's another one. Freiling Rezick. Town center, complex 28. - I don't think any of us knew what the best... - We leave in 30 minutes. We'll get our things and we'll be right back. Come on, Fitscher. - See you soon. - Bye. - Better give the baby the valerian so he'll sleep. - It's really happening. - Norder Wilhelm. Schillerstraße 16. - Reports on the first two names, major...Negative. - You're not mopping. - No, I did it this morning. All right. No, leave the lights on. Fitscher, no toys. - These don't weigh much, papa. - Your favorite one, that's it. - We'll buy some more when we get there. - You've gained weight. - I've got my good slacks on underneath. I'm not arriving in west Germany looking like a bum. - Uh-uh. - Johannes bierschnapps. - Well, can't leave that for the SSD. Champagne? - Mama brought it to us. "To be used for a very special occasion." - Major Körner, we haven't contacted two of the possibles yet. The rest are clear. - Two s's for you. Streiger, Stefan. Apartment five. Wertherstraße Strelzyk, Doris. Altenbrückweg, 46. Strelyzk. My neighbors. He has a trailer. Always coming and going at night. - Come on, Frank. Let's start it. - We'll catch up with you. - No one here. - There's-- there's another family. Wetzer. A younger man? Fair? Tuchwilerstraße. - Cover the back. Quickly. Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. They've been acting very suspiciously, four weeks ago - just a moment. Major Körner, the woman says both families left only a few minutes ago in a blue and white Wartburg. - Emergency alert. All roads between here and the border, red, white Wartburg 311, license NK9743. The vehicle is pulling a trailer. Repeat. Emergency alert. What's wrong? - I don't know. - I still don't see them. They should have caught up by now. What's happened to them? - I don't know. We'll wait for them here. - So far, no trace. - Eight people, a car, a trailer. Call lieutenant Fehler. I'm going to the border station. - Yes, Sir. - All right! Come on. Come on! - Something's happened. I'm going back to the house. - No, Peter. Wait! - Sorry. It stalled. Are you sure? Thank you. They may have been seen near Lebengrün. - Send all available units. And I want every lookout tower on full alert. - This is lieutenant Fehler. Send all units to the Lebengrün area. [Alarm blaring, siren wailing] What is papa doing? - We bought a new tent and he wants to see if it works. If the stakes fit into the loops. - A big truck ahead. Get ready to pass. - Hey. How we doing? Almost vroom, right? Why is papa making a fire? - It's cold out there. - Climb on! - We're ready to go. - Ready, Doris. - Let's go. Everybody out. * - we're overheating! Doris, tell them to be quick! Quickly run here now! Come on! Quickly! Quickly! - Hurry! - All right. Take it easy. That's all right. - Here you go. - You better sit down. - Sit down.

Ow! - Pa, we're on fire! - Oh, my God, Peter! - Frank, get the extinguisher, for God's sake! - Oh, my God! It's burning! - Quickly! Is everyone alright? - Frank has a nasty cut. How about you, Fitscher? - It's all right, mom. - It's already at 1,000 feet. We're going up too fast. Will it hold? - It has to. - Oh, my God. Look! - Higher. - Tower 416 reporting. - Major Körner, they've been spotted. - Let's go. Quick, we're moving out. What's wrong? - I don't know. It seems to be blocked. How high are we? - Almost 6,000 feet. - It's cold. I want to get off. - There he is. I've lost them. - They must be out of fuel. - Then they're descending. We've got them. All ground units. Major Körner to all ground units. Converge on sectors 15 and 16. - Try the weld starter again. - Turn it up higher. - I'm falling! I'm falling, mama. I'm falling. - It's all right, little Peter.

The gas is gone. - * hold me * hold me, hold me * bum bum bum * hold me * hold me * hold me, hold me, bum bum bum * [alarm blaring, siren wailing] - We've been up 27 minutes. - It's not enough. Günther, see if the light will reach the ground. - I'm glad we tried. - Hang on. We may hit the trees. - No, no, no! There's a clearing! - Hold on! Everyone all right? - Yes. - Yeah. I think so. - Easy. Give me your hand. - I'll take the baby. Single file. Right. Günther and I will scout ahead. The rest of you stay here. If we find anything, then we'll light the flare. - But if we're in the zone-- - please just wait. Stay here. - We didn't make it, did we? - Hey, don't worry. Pa won't let us down. - Stop. You there, come out! - Are we in the west? - Of course you are. - Hey! Yeah! Günther! - Thank God! - Yes! - Go! Come on! - Oh, here. Let me. - Papa! Papa! Papa! - We made it! We did it! Yeah!
