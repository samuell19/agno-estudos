[car door shuts] How many pedophiles, you caught? As of today, 288, not so bad. How many kids you found? It is a high probability that most of those kids are outside of the US, Chris.

TIM: See, part of my job, is looking at everything. You tell me how I'm supposed to gaze at so much beauty, without... being drawn to it? TIM: Without wanting it. You want me to believe you're one of us? You think I'm that stupid? TIM: "Only the courageous act. The rest are tyrannized by a legal system, made by cowardly men who cannot admit their true desires." TIM: End quote. So what? You read my book.

One week. [door opens] Mr. Oshinsky... Time to go home. [car door opens and closes] [drums and electric guitar play] [kettle whistling] TIM: Bottom line, they've got you. 20 to 30, conservative. But here's the thing... Whatever they build up against you... I'll knock down. That's my job. But... here's the thing I need... I need a real one. I don't act on my fantasies. TIM: What about that trip you took last year? TIM: The one out of Cartagena? The "Butterfly Cruise". TIM: Come on. I need this, my friend. Almost as bad as you do.

Which means she'll disappear, sir. For good. We're Homeland Security, you know we can't go off rescuing Honduran kids in Colombia. Look, the boy's back with his father... that's a career-capper, take it and move on. I can't. I don't... think you understand what I'm asking you. See ah... This job tears you to pieces. And this is... my one chance to put those pieces back together. I suppose I could tell DC that you're... You're going down there to have a "training seminar". Fund it out of discretionary. Keep it under ten grand. Honey... [soft music] [music builds] [plane landing] Hey... Welcome to Cartagena. Mucho gusto. Nice to meet you. [music continues] [big truck engine] So, I took the liberty of sending your report to a "non-police" type. And he came back with a lead. Welcome to his office. [background conversations] Hey, Mami! Keep an eye on my Ferrari. [conversations and street noise] Okay. There are two things you should know about Vampiro. He ran the Cali cartel's money-laundering operations in the nineties. He did time in prison. And the second thing: He buys children. And then he sets them free. He puts these kids in safe houses. He gives them a new chance at life. Vampiro! [music continues] [soft bar piano music] Some ground-rules, Timoteo. Don't ever step into my office again looking like you just walked out of a friggin' Banana Republic ad. Hm? Save that for Bogotá, man. This is Cartagena. It's a beach town, a party town. Lighten up. Jorge, guy's down here looking for a little pedo-action, what's he wear? Chancletas, flip-flops, T-shirt. Exactly. What I need to see is some horny hung-over rich American, stinking of beer, crawling out of a big honking automobile. Rent something obnoxious. And black. And now Timoteo, the kid. Miguel. He's back with his father, huh? Yes. How did that make you feel? Giving a child his freedom? Felt good. Like, "back-rub" good, or "chicken-wings" good? What kind of good are we talking about here? The kind that gives hope. Come on, amigo. You've been at this for 12 years. Why are you doing it? [piano continues] Because God's children are not for sale. That is why I am giving you my Friday night. And the plan unfolds. Now the sister, the pretty one, What's her name? Rocio. As of this moment, she could be a block down the road, or she could be in Moscow, Bangkok, L.A. And yes, I do know an young attractive woman who matches your "Giselle". Major operator, runs 10, 15 kids. Sources her children out of Central America, so she doesn't have to deal with the Colombian cops. Lures them in with her looks, promises the sun and the moon... a month later, they're turning five, six tricks a night. You got a photo? That's the easy part. Meet Miss Cartagena. A verifiable beauty queen. Her name's Katty Juarez. She's clean, not even a parking ticket in the colonial area. No record of leaving Colombia since she was 12. Set me up on a date. Tell Miss Cartagena you got a horny, hung-over, rich, American looking for a little pedo-action. You don't just set up a date with Katty Juarez. She only deals with street traffickers, people she knows, old friends. She keeps her nails very clean. That is a tough marlin to hook. [drums beating] [street noise] [drums and percussion] AMERICAN EXECUTIVE RAN CHILD SEX CLUB IN THAILAND [phone rings] [drums beating] Guy was making close to a quarter million a month. You said that Katie has about 15-20 kids, right? Who’s this? Scattered all over Cartagena? Probably some in Cali, Medellin? Timoteo? So Rocio could be anywhere. But what if we needed all those kids? I don't understand, amigo. I don’t understand, amigo. You ever heard of Club Bangkok? It's a members-only club full of rich perverts, jet-setters, CEO's. It's a high-end facility, stocked 24/7 with a hundred kids. And who supplied them? A bunch of sex traffickers who got greedy. If they can build one in Bangkok why can't we build one here? You wanna build a high-end sex hotel? TIM: Yes I do. And I found just the right investor. [car driving off] Pablo Delgado... runs a four billion dollar real estate development company, with holdings all over the world. He loves to play cop. We've already used him on two separate missions, he eats this stuff up. That's the look, my friend. And he can build a sex hotel anywhere he wants. You know someone who can bring a deal like this to the marketplace? ["Braty Puti" plays] Hello, pretty. Hi, love. Hello, pretty. Calacas! Calacas! Vampiro! Vampiro! Where is your horny friend? Change of plans. Put on a bow tie. We're going to the classy part of town. [El Calacas laughs] [footsteps] This is sweet. Like the old days. Wow! This guy knows how to party. [sounds of Tim getting sick in the bathroom] That's it, amigo. No more aguardiente. [birds tweeting] I think I may have to expand your mind to an entirely new reality. Okay. These gentlemen want to build a one of a kind, members-only club near Cartagena. Annual fee: one hundred grand per member. They take care of the facility we take care of the talent. And the members, they get a world-class resort with full access to models, 24/7, all-you-can-eat. Live-in models. Young ones. How young? TIM: Shock me. Which one is this? El Calacas. VAMPIRO: He used to deliver escorts for Escobar. He sold me a chicken last year, 9 years old. And she was... Nine legit or a 15 year-old with pigtails? I deal in pure cocaine, papi... So how many chickens do you want? For starters, 50 or 60. [Calacas laughs] Minimum. Go big or go home. Right? I think your amigo ate the worm. I think he just sobered up. [stifling laughter] That's a lot of chickens, papi. No one can do that alone. I'm not asking you if you can do it alone. I'm just asking if you can do it. ["Awa Didjen" plays] [Motorcycle engines] [camera clicks] plus five support agents for a month in-country, the penthouse in Bogota, the mansion in Cartagena, on and on, and yet somehow... somehow, you have failed to bring me one real-world lead, or one American child, or one American trafficker, or one reason DC would let you within a million miles of this, and a bunch of glamor shots of Miss Cartagena don't count! She has the girl. And I say the girl is in Russia. Prove me wrong. It's over, Tim. Close up, get on a plane and come back home. Bureaucracy is shit. This is why I operate black. Have a nice flight, Timoteo. TIM: You were a cartel guy... VAMPIRO: Yeah. Kept your mouth shut, did your time. Could've picked up where you left off, bought yourself a condo on the beach. Instead you're doing this. Why? Really? [Vampiro takes a deep breath] I had that condo on the beach. Fifteenth floor, marble everything, overlooking the whole bay. First night out of jail I slept in my own bed. Day two, I was back in business, same old life. But it doesn't feel right... not the drugs, not the hookers. But dammit if I didn't keep trying... [Vampiro takes another deep breathe] So one night I'm leaving a bar all jacked up on coca and I notice this young girl on the corner. Fine looking, maybe 20, 25. I take her up to my place, do the deed, pay the bill. She's putting on her shoes, and I notice something. I notice her foot. She's got these little pink cat faces painted on her toenails. And it hit me. She's not 25. Then she glances up and our eyes connect. And it was like I was granted a glimpse into her soul, and all I saw was sadness... Out of nowhere she starts talking. Turns out she's not 25. Not even 20. This girl is 14 years old, Timoteo. She's been doing this since she was six. Looks at me, smiles, takes the money, walks out the door. All of a sudden I'm hit by this tidal wave, this tsunami of darkness, and I know I'm the sadness in her eyes. Me. I'm the darkness. And I know the darkness has to die. So I get my 45. Put it to my head. Put my finger on the trigger. Now if there's a time to ask if God exists, that would be it. [soft violin plays] So I did. When God tells you what to do, you cannot hesitate. [acoustic guitar plays] Katherine: So you've thought of that... of doing it on your own? TIM: I won't be on my own. I just have to convince Pablo. KATHRINE: Okay. So you quit your job and you go and rescue these kids. [horns play softly] My resignation's in your box. Wait. You do realize you're ten months away from vesting your pension. TIM: I do. You know I did everything I could, but the law is the law. TIM: Did you know that were over 22 million new images of child pornography on the web this past year? That's a five thousand percent increase over the past five years. Five thousand percent. The fact is it is the fastest growing international crime network that the world has ever seen. PABLO: I agreed to it because we were working with the U.S. government. TIM: If you back out now this whole thing will blow! It has already passed the illegal arms trade. And soon it's gonna pass the drug trade. You Wanna know why? Because you can sell a bag of cocaine one time. But a child, the most precious child... You can sell a five year-old kid five to ten times a day for ten years straight! And everyday ordinary people don't want to hear it, it's too ugly for polite conversation, but meanwhile over two million children a year are being sucked into the deepest recesses of hell. Trust me, man. If we do nothing, their pain is gonna spread and spread till some day it's gonna reach the likes of you. And that will be a nightmare that you never gonna wake up from. I'm sorry. [violin music swells] Sir, the gentleman who just left asked me to give you this.
