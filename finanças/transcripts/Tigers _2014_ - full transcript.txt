Coffee? - No. Milk? Ayan. Hi, Ayan. - Hi Ayan, How are you doing? Hi, Hi guys. Ayan, I just wanted you to know that, I really wanna produce the movie version of your story. But, you are asking us to take a very powerful coperation. I'm here with frank our financier's lawyer. And he just wants to make sure that everything is safe for our backers. Now, everything you say is true and we can prove that it's true then we can make this film. Listen, Ayan, we've just came back from pakistan and there are some things in our screenplay that don't add up for us. So we just need to make sure that, we've got the full story. You understand? - Yes. And we're gonna record this incase we need it as evidence in court. Nadeem, how do I turn this on? You're the director. So... Ayan, where does your story start? "Beloved..." "Your love is beautiful." "Beloved..." "My heart flutters." Do you like Bollywood movies? Imran! Congratulations buddy! I wanted to come but my boss is a real... Don't worry. Zainab. Congratulations! Can you turn the TV around a little bit? Here, take it. I've seen it already. Thank you. 'Enemy?' 'No, friend.' 'Good luck, good luck.' 'You call this good luck?' 'Yes.' 'Very soon something good is going to happen to you...' Yeah! Movie time. - Sajid... Sajid! You silly boy, come out of there! Come on! 'Hey, good luck!' Leave them alone. It's not your room any more. But Mum, they're watching a movie. I'll tell your Dad! - It's not fair. Ayan, I'm sure it was a lovely wedding, but what we really need to know is how you got the job. If you want to understand my story, you have to understand my life. My family. Before all of this began. 'I was a, a salesman for a local,' Pakistani pharmacuetical company.' 'We used to sell drugs to the doctors.' 'But the doctors had no time for us.' 'The multinatinals were the only ones they listened to.' Doctor! Why burden your patients with the expensive multinational brands? Why should they pay for fancy packaging? Here, is an antibiotic manufactured in our country. I know your products but no one wants to buy Pakistani drugs. But they're the same and a fifth of the price. They're cheaper! But people don't want to buy them because they don't trust them. What about the poor people? When it comes to their health, even they are ready to pay the price for fancy packaging. Let me leave you some free samples. Your company might have money to spare, but I don't have time to waste. Doctor, please listen to me. Ayan! Yes, Happy-Ji. Are you happy? Yes, Happy-Ji. Do you think I am happy? You are... - Do you think I am happy! You will have your rent by the end of the week. In consideration of this case we would like to state that, the evidence provided by the prosecution... She types very well. Dinner! Dinner is ready. Eat, eat, eat... All we do in this house is eat. No problem I'll give your share of dessert to the boys. Okay. How was your day? Nobody wants to buy local products any more... I hope tomorrow will be better than today! God willing! - God willing! Son. Tomorrow when he goes to the High Court with his letter of protest you go with him and tell the Judge your father didn't mean any offence. Come on, sit down. Sit, have dinner. Come on. The food is served. Come, now. Move! - Hurry up. The food is hot. Eat fast. Please don't rush us... Chewing food is as important as eating it. So eat it now and save the chewing for later! Your father was a lawyer? No, not officialy. The government took away his job and he taught himself the law to try and win it back. He loved the legal jargon. Here you are. Please take a look at this. A big multinational company is looking for medical representatives. They're looking for college graduates. Read. Your mum told me, when your father lost his job, you left college and started working. Ayan! Zainab I know these people, they only want college graduates. Ayan you are an excellent salesman, you can sell anything. Try. What do you have to lose? Ayan! Come here children... Ok, I'll give it a shot. But I know it's not going to work. Here, try this one. I had it made when I was your age. It should fit you. See? Let me see. Perfect fit! You look good! No.. no... Take that off. It's all wrong. It looks like your elder brother's! Try this one. - Yes try this one. Ayan! These shoes, they're from Javed's wedding. He only wore them once. Try them on. Now he looks like an executive with a big multinational company. Which company is it? You'll find out soon enough. - Take this, it's my favourite. Try to speak in English when you get there, okay? Yes... that will impress them. It's extremely hot! Darn you! They say it brings luck. You must have been through a lot. If you have to find your luck... in bird shit! Are you going to use the real company name? Of course. It would be helpful not to use ***. Well, let's just assume that we will not use the company name we will see how it feels. Okay. Greetings! - Greetings! Are you here for me? - Yes, sir. How are you? - I'm good. How are you? Hi! Good morning Tigers. That's what I'm going to call you. That's what I want you to be. Tigers. Good morning Tiger Waleed. Good morning sir. - Tiger sir! Good morning Tiger sir. Good morning Tiger Ayan. Good morning Tiger sir. Growl Tigers. I said growl! That is a growl! A real growl. Let that growl that is inside you, come out now. I need you to give me your best today. Only a few of you are going to make it to become sales representatives. You will be selling the world's best infant formula with the world's best company... Lastavita. So go get 'em. What did they ask you? It was all about "Who do I know?" Doctors, hospitals, etc. I thought they were just looking for guys with diplomas. Alright! So you say you know all the doctors here? Yes sir, I spend my days going from one doctor to another. Really? So how well do you know them? I meet them every day in all the hospitals. So do you know them or do you spend your time waiting outside their offices? I know them. Alright. So, what can you tell me about Dr. Wasim? Wasim... Who works at the Civil hospital. Wasim... He's a good doctor. He has a lot of patients. Yes. He's a good doctor. Doctor Wasim works at the Hassan hospital. I'm sorry. There's been a misunderstanding. We're looking for people with experience. Sir... 2.0! - Yes, and then it went off to 2.8%. Ali-Rasool Medical Store. Ayub-Aalam Pharmacy. - Excuse me! Mustafa-Rashid Pharmacy. Wasim... Central Medical Supplies... - So? Which do you think is easier? Working for you and just walking into all the top doctors' offices or travelling hundreds of kilometers around every two-bit pharmacy, selling local products no-one really wants? I have to be ten times as good as these guys to sell this stuff. Lasta food inc! This stuff sells itself. If I can make a living selling what I sell, can you imagine what I would do with your products? If you don't hire me, you are a... stupid man. "Why do I keep wandering" "around the world?" Greetings uncle! - Greetings! Ayan, did you get the job? Thanks for the jacket. Greetings! - Greetings! What happened Ayan? How come you're so late? We were worried. The interview didn't go well? "The time has come to bow my head." - He got the job. "O my, Almighty!" - You got it! "O my, Almighty!" x - You got the job! "O my, Almighty!" - He got the job! Why are you shouting? - He got a job with Lasta! Wow! Ayan, you got the job. "O my, Almighty!" I told you, you're my lucky charm. I always had faith in you. I'm so happy you got the job. What is your salary? I forgot to ask... Wow chocolates! - Its Lasta. They will pay well. Go away. These are not for you. Mum let them take some it's for them. No, no. We need sweets for people who come to visit us. Oh, mom! Here you go. Ayan, you said the advert in the newspaper was for college graduates. Yet you got the job, What happened? I told you, they were impressed by how well I know my area. But, even I was surprised when I got the job. Thanks. There is no proof that he forged the diploma. I know. That's exactly what we're up against. If they say he forged it, we have to prove otherwise that's how defirmaton law works: guilty until proven innocent. So they can make up anything and we have to prove it's not true? Yes, Yes, you do. Okay. Don't come inside, go away. Thank you for the job sir. I promise I'll work very hard. You got the job. Now let's see if you can keep it. Raja! - Yes. Come here! So this is your base. Anything you need, you'll get it here. Greetings! - Greetings! This is Ayan, the new medical representative for South-East zone. Welcome. - Thank you sir. Go, get the stuff for him. He's not "sir" to you, you are "sir" to him. So this is what you'll be selling. These are the keys that will help you unlock doors to meet doctors... nurses and pharmacists. You can even have some for yourself. For your relatives, but close family only. Sign here. This is very important for you. Imprest money! That's what our accountants call it. But I call it "impress money" because we use it to impress people. Find out which doctors have the most patients befriend them and if need be spend "impress money" on them. But remember, results should accompany every expenditure. Sure. There are four classes of doctor. Doctor Saleem is triple A. He has 300 newborns every month. He has two kids, and he likes football very much. He is very religious. Take good care of him. Then double A class, A class, and "just doctors." "Just doctors" are a waste of time. Sign up the triple As and the double As. Learn everything about them. Everything means everything! Befriend them and they will recommend our products. It's as simple as that. Greetings! How are you? - Greetings! This one is young, probably not many patients and by the way he dresses you can see he is greedy. So don't waste your time on him. Anyway, your job is to make sure that every baby born here... is a Lasta baby. Got it? Farida! Farida! Take this. You didn't have to! Thanks for your kind gesture. I'm sorry we kept your son's shoes for so long! Why are you talking like this? Come in, let's have tea. Oh Taslima, so many gifts? You know how Ayan is. Ayan said, "Please Mum, give these to Aunty Farida." "I don't care if there's nothing left for us." You are very lucky Taslima... He is God's gift. What are you doing? The black boxes mean those doctors are mine. Ah, Dr. Nawaz is also mine. Are you going to growl like this every time you do this, Mr. Lion? I'm a Tiger, actually. Oh, I am sorry. My mistake, I didn't realize that was a tiger's growl. Ayan... Oh, no Ayan, not that, please, not that. Oh, no Ayan, not that, please, not that. Oh no Ayan, not that, please... - Growl tigress, growl! Ayan! "Uselessly..." "It is now you who has mislead me, my beloved." We should get our own place. You don't even know how much they're paying you and we're already talking about getting our own place? I thought tigers only growled when they have caught their prey. Greetings! - Greetings! I am from Lasta. I need some information. Please speak to the doctor directly. I will, of course, but... Oh, please have this. I know you work hard all day and all night. No, thank you. Please. I get all this for free. Okay, no problem. Well... I guess... I could share it with my colleagues. No... this is just for you. I have more for them. Thank you. Your Dr. Faiz sounds very interesting? Yes... but don't try to give him chocolates. Not even for his birthday? He doesn't celebrate his birthday. You can give us his share of chocolates. I don't think he eats chocolates. Would your magic bag happen to have lipsticks in it too? I can get some if you need them. Really? - Yes. So tell me... What does Dr. Faiz like? What are you doing here? I have an appointment with you. Oh... Looks like it's been a tough day for you. We can meet later. No. It's alright. In any case, you are not the last one. Okay... Why don't you use these 10 minutes to relax. Call home or read a paper. Use these ten minutes as a break. I'll sit here and check my notes. Are you sure? Yes, you guys are heroes, you save lives... This is the least I can do. I forgot... this is for you. Please... keep it. Thank you very much... can I...? Sure. It's yours. As a junior doctor you're very vulnerable. And it's very flattering, when a medical reps knows the music you like. It's called investing in people and before you know it, you're trying to please them by making sure your hospital only stocks their products. And when your hospital only stocks their product, then so do all the surrounding pharmacies. You have to ask yourself are you a great guy or are you so popular because you have so many patients. Faiz... I have the same poster. Well, this is an original photo. No! Where did you get it? How about a game now? What? Now? How can I leave? There are medical representatives outside waiting for meetings. Sahil! - Howzzat? The English are so boring. They're playing for a draw. How are my products selling? Going well. And what about the competition? Seems like they are playing for a draw as well. That's not good enough. I want them out. I can't just kick them out. Yes, you can. You just lack faith. Maybe I could get you tickets for the final test. Would that restore your faith? Greetings! - Greetings! I'm glad I ran into you. I have a proposal for you. I'm organizing a dinner for all the pediatricians. I thought you might like to sponsor the dinner. That way you can meet all the best doctors and you can make friends in other hospitals. You can save a lot of time this way. Sure... I think I might be able to help you with that. I knew you were the right man for the job. Goodbye! - Goodbye! Ayan! I was worried the doctors would have to pay for their own dinner. Come, let me introduce you to them. Come. You're going to love this. You will be very happy. Let me introduce you to someone... and you will thank me for the rest of your life. Dr. Malik... - Yes. May I present Ayan Rashid. - Greetings! Greetings! - He is a Lasta representative. Okay. - Ayan, meet Lt. Col. Dr. Malik, the new Head of the Military Hospital. It is a pleasure to meet you. - Thank you. Can I talk to you about our range of products? Why don't you come to my office next week we can sit and talk. Thank you very much! - You are welcome! Thank you. - Come. Dr. Salim... - Hi Maggi. Maggi, this is Ayan. What is the meaning of the Lasta sign at the entrance? Well they have generously offered to pay for the dinner. We're not going to make a presentation if this is a Lasta event. But who will pay for the dinner then? It's them or us. Take your pick. Maggi. Who's that? Maggi. She works for The Hub. What do they do? Nothing much. They are just a pain in the neck. Okay if you don't mind don't pay for the dinner. But what is their problem? They work with the UN and the World Health Organisation. They just don't like multinational companies. That is their problem! Anyway... you carry on. I have to meet a few more doctors. Greetings! - Greetings! How are you? I am going to Karachi to get a Masters degree in public health care. Your friend has been awarded a scholarship! That's wonderful. Congratulations. Thank you. But you don't look happy. No I am... I was just wondering who will I beat at cricket now. Oh you wish! When was the last time you beat me at my own game? How were the doctors' wives? Oh, at first they ignored me. Then they started talking about how much their husbands earn, and when I told them you are making 30,000 Rupees a month... They suddenly became friendly. But I'm not making 30,000. How will they know? Now they think that you make more money than their husbands. What's the problem with that? Ayan, I did all this to build your image... so it's fine. Let's go. Oh God! Oh God! What happened to my Tiger's growl? Greetings! I heard you've become friends with Lt. Col. Malik. Too bad you didn't meet him a few months ago. Sign here. Just a formality. It seems you have a lot of fans among the doctors. They seem to have only good things to say about you. You are a really lucky fellow. So... it's time to expand your frontiers. I want to conquer this region. I want Lasta displayed everywhere. Shops, gas stations,... pharmacies, etc.. Okay. Zainab! Zainab! Come down... We were so happy. Ayan, how long was it until Dr. Faiz came back from Karachi? About two years? Yes. Our brand is recognised and used worldwide. You want the best for your children and this is the best. It's now available in soft packs too. Zainab, you shouldn't be carrying Umer while you're pregnant. I am alright. What are you doing here? We are here to take part in the competition. I've told you time and again, we can't enter. Of course we can... our child is cutest of them all. Mum, I am organizing this contest and my son can't take part in it. Oh my god! Why? Are you planning to bribe the judge? It's about principles! It's alright. As long as you follow the rules. We also know right from wrong! Greetings Ayan! - Greetings! I need some prescription pads. Sure... come. Aman, look in the front! Darling, look ahead. By God's grace! He's really cute. These papers came in from head office... And they said it's mandatory to read them. More paperwork. Greetings! - Greetings! Please take this. - What's this? It's a gift. You're very kind hearted. - Anything for you sir. Do you have any extra gifts? Yes, of course. This is for your two boys. Goodbye! - Goodbye! How does he know I have two children? Ayan knows everything, about everybody! Faiz, you're back? How are you? - Fine. Did you get your Masters degree? - Yes. That's great! When did you get back? A few weeks ago. You should have called me. Listen, I've moved house... - Congratulations. We're organizing a conference on infant nutrition at the Pearl Continental Hotel... You should come. We can catch up there and... - Dr. Faiz. She's getting worse. Please come. Are you still working for Lasta? - Yes. Come with me. I want to show you something. What happened? Acute dehydration caused by diarrhoea. Is there nothing you can do? All her internal organs have collapsed. All we can do is pray. I'll go. - Wait... I'd like you to stay. After all, you work in child nutrition. This is very common here. It's the 5th case this month. Why is it so common? Because of people like you, Ayan. What? This lady here, she has two other children. Only this one is unwell. Do you want to know why? She breastfed the other kids and gave this one your company's formula. The one you've been selling so passionately! Most of my patients are illiterate. They don't have access to clean water. They mix your company's formula in filthy water and give it to infants. The kids get diarrhoea. Breast milk provides a natural immunity your formula can't give. These babies are dying because of your company's formula. And this is happening every day. Why didn't you tell me about this two years ago? Because I didn't know until I went to Karachi. So, if the doctors prescribe formula why would I think there's a problem with the product? They prescribe it because you put pressure on them by giving them gifts and money. Look. It's great, you've learned something. Now, go, do what you have to do! Raja. - Yes, Sir. Where is Bilal? He has gone to Lahore for a few days. Tell him to call me. Okay. 'Come on, make it fast. Come on!' Greetings! - Greetings! Listen Ayan, I'm sorry I was tough on you. When we banned formula in the Karachi Hospital, the babies just stopped dying. It was like a miracle. Just imagine... all the mothers have to do is breastfeed their babies. Look. A mother of twins was told she should feed one of them with milk formula. The child that was breastfed, is healthy and alive. And the other one died the day after this picture was taken. There was lot of debate about this photo. I've seen suggestions that might be staged. She posed for the photo to warn other mothers. Her daughter died after the picture was taken. Faiz is one of your key witnesses, you are relying on him to validate important points of your story. If he endorses this photograph on screen and you can't prove the story behind it, then you risk undermining his credibility. Did he even endrose in his statement? No. - No. It was only after I went to karachi and saw how people really lived in the slums that I connnected the dots. But, before that I did exactly what Ayan was paid to make me do. I used to prescribe his formula and helped sell these women something they didn't even need. So, after Karachi I banned the sales reps. And I showed Ayan the truth. But, it never occurred to me that he would do what he did. What's wrong Ayan? I am resigning. What do I tell Bilal? Someone has rightly said why live the easy life when you can make things complicated? Don't you think I deserve an explanation? Babies are dying because of our products. How's that for a reason? Don't tell me you've fallen for that NGO shit! It's not our fault Ayan... if the government gives filthy water to people. You knew about this? I had no clue... I really have nothing more to say. Don't try and act innocent Ayan! You read the Charter... so you know the rules! Ayan! 'Lasta doesn't give incentives to its staff based on sales.' 'Doesn't give financial or material incentives' 'to health professionals' 'for the purpose of promoting infant formula...' 'Lasta will take disciplinary measures' 'against any Lasta personnel' 'who deliberately violate this policy.' They gave me money to do all these things and here they say they will punish me if I do them. I have a cupboard filled with receipts and invoices for all the incentives I'm not supposed to have given out. I have letters from Lasta confirming they allowed me to buy these things! If you can prove that you did all this under their instructions and you have all the receipts. There's nothing they can do. Lasta Foods is one of the biggest companies in Pakistan. Our government needs their support. The Government is always going to side with them. So all the things you have been telling me mean nothing? I didn't tell you to quit your job or to attack one of the biggest food companies in the world Ayan. So, might is right in your eyes? I'm just a doctor in a small town. I can't take responsibility for the whole country. They fired you? No, I quit. Are you pulling my leg? Why would someone leave that job? I'm not pulling your leg. Here, I have this new range of antibiotics, made in Pakistan. They're a fifth of the price. You know I can't take those. Thank you. Yes. Greetings! Next! Read! 'I, being a responsible citizen of Pakistan,' 'keeping in view the illegal and unethical ways' 'adopted by your company,' 'hereby direct you to stop your business' 'of infant food manufacturing in Pakistan' 'and withdraw all your infant food products' 'from the Pakistani markets' 'within 15 days of receipt of this Legal Notice.' And of course the evidence, the receipts. As a precaution, we will keep them in a safe place. Why? We will just send photocopies with the letters. When the court demands the originals, we will hand them over. Until then, we will keep them safe. Lock them away. Greetings! - Greetings! Come in! Greetings! - Greetings! Thank you for coming. Thank you. These are the statistics from my hospital in Karachi. I hope they are useful. Please let me know how else I can help you? With God's grace! We should put them all in separate postboxes. Let's go. Look what we brought you. I am trying to save every Rupee I can and you're buying rasmalai? Have some... Rasmalai... please have some. How is it? - It's good. Do you want some more? What's the matter? Take me to the hospital. How is Zainab? Faiz says she's okay. - Greetings! These two letters came for you. They're offering to pay my expenses. Do they think we are doing all this for 20,000 Rupees? We will teach them that money can't buy everything! Greetings! Ayan Rashid? - Yes. Congratulations! It's a girl. Thank God! Ayan was very angry that they tried to make him pay for damage to his company motorcycle. But, as soon as the Legal Notice went in, they agreed to pay the 20,000. But they didn't respond to the demands that they stop marketing infant formula, So he sent the notice to the World Health Organisation. And that is when things started to feel very dangerous. Follow him. - Okay. There he is. Come on! Hey, you! Stop! Greetings! - Ayan! The WHO has copied your letter to the local district health officer alleging unethical practices by doctors. So now the whole town knows what you're up to! The accusations you have made. The names you have given. Everyone's worried. Doctors are refusing to meet representatives. What were you thinking? I am doing what I think is right! Yes, but you are forgetting that you are just a salesman. Please... Please leave. And please don't come back. Thank you. Hello! Faiz! Are you alright? They came to my house. Bilal, and another man. I think he was his boss. They said that no one would be spared... and that I am risking mine and my family's life by supporting you. What? How do they know you're involved? I don't know. Ayan... What's going on? Nothing. Go to sleep. Hello... Hi, I am Ayan. Yes, I remember. You work for Lasta. Not anymore. I used to work for Lasta. I am Dr. Faiz. So, how can I help you? Why did you keep all these receipts and letters? They give me money to impress the doctors. I have to be able to prove what I spend it on. You kept very thorough records. Is that all you have to say? We need time to check your allegations. - Time? How much time do you need? How many more babies should die before you decide to trust me. I'm not the one who was selling this stuff. You are right, I was. Look, you can leave the receipts... - I don't think so. Let's go Faiz. He is a good man and he really needs your help. I'll send you copies. Hello? Yes Colonel. I am fine, how are you? Yes. Yes the Pakistani products... yes. Whenever you say, I will come. Yes. Thank you. Goodbye! Greetings! Greetings! Do you want some tea? - No. Where are you going? Stay at home take care of yourself and kids. Is everything alright? Everything is alright. Dad will stay with you. Goodbye! Goodbye! - Goodbye! My angel... I've spent 20 years in the army, never had any problems, and now this. What do you think you are doing Ayan? How dare you mention my name in all your legal nonsense? I want you to find a solution to this problem, now. Colonel, there are babies dying every year... Don't mess with us boy. What are you getting out of this? Nothing... - Ayan... It's not too late. The company will take you back. I'm not joking. - I'm not coming back. Sorry? I'm not coming back. You're mad. Think about your family, Ayan! What about my family? Are you threatening me? You've accused people of taking bribes. You've made a lot of enemies. I don't have to threaten you. Do you know what you're playing with? You do what you want to do and I'll do what I have to. Ayan, stop. What do you think this is? A street market? You can walk in and out as you please? Colonel, you are a father yourself. Imagine if your sons died? Soldier! - Yes sir! How would you feel? - Keep this man under guard. "O my Almighty!" "O my Almighty!" "O my Almighty!" "O my Almighty!" You should choose your battles carefully. Sometimes peace is better than being right. These people could buy the whole government of Pakistan, put it in a box, wrap it up with ribbons and sell it as a souvenir. You can fight with them, but you can't win. 'And this is the diarrhoea ward' 'of the National Institute of Child Health in Karachi.' 'You may find this scene as distressing as we did filming it.' 'But it's a common event in this hospital. 'This little girl was badly malnourished' 'and then dehydrated after several bouts of diarrhoea.' 'She was so sick, when other complications set in 'there was little chance of saving her.' 'There are wards like this in every hospital we saw here in Karachi.' 'Cases are tragically similar.' 'The pattern is being repeated around the country.' What's going on? Ayan... Maggi's been through the evidence. She thinks it's great. She has spoken to some people. You should see this video. Greetings! First of all apologies for the other day. I had no idea until you presented this unbelievable material. This is incredible evidence. I've never seen this in 20 years of working and I just wanted to say that no one from inside has ever produced this. This kind of information and this is a smoking gun. What is she doing here? What do you mean? Ayan. What's going on? I have no idea. What's wrong? Zainab, this is too dangerous. I can't risk your life or the kids. Don't you dare use me and our children as a reason to not do what is right. Did you tell her how dangerous this can be? How dangerous these people are? What could happen to my family, did you tell her? Ayan... Ayan. If you do this, we might be ruined forever but if you don't do this, I won't be able to respect you again. I wanted to protect my family, my children. Zainab wanted to protect everyone's else children. Take care of yourself. - Don't worry. Goodbye. Ayan let's call it a day. It's probably around lunch time in Torronto. - Okay. And it's dinner time here. Bye. = Bye. Listen Ayan. Speak to you tomorrow. Hey, Frank do you wanna stay for a drink? Ahh... I'm already late. I'll see you tommorow. Bye. - Bye. We are definitely changing those names. Why? - Because we gave him a chance to tell the truth and he didn't. What do you mean? Why would Ayan decide to fight after he was being threatend? He realised that his evidence could make a difference. Saint Ayan. Come on, Maggi. We heard some stories in pakistan that we can't ignore. Look we worked on this for months. We checked and double checked the documents. What are you telling me? I want to hear the truth. I'm this close to walking away from this project. Do you understand? Maggi you know how this goes. If there are any holes in the story they will kill us. Tell us. What happened? This is really good. They authorised a gift of an air conditioner to a doctor. Ayan we need a chain of evidence. Letters from your supervisors, copies of cheques. You say they put cash in your account. But can you actually prove you used the cash to pay for the air conditioner? But what does it matter? Bilal approved it, look it says... 'Ok, but sales must go up...' Can you prove you spent the money for it? I'm tired of this. Greetings! Greetings! - Are you okay? Welcome to my new home! Hello Maggi... Dr. Faiz how are you? - Good. Look. Looks great! - Thank you. Not sure about the colour yet. We'll see... You should talk to Ayan. - Why? If we try to publish this in Pakistan we can't guarantee his safety. And this may never see the light of day. So... We need international support. In the meantime we need to keep him safe. Yes. You know what people are saying about you? According to them you are the worst guy around. And they feel you have a hidden motive behind all this. Honestly speaking half the city is looking for you! Are you okay? Yes, I am fine... don't worry about me, you take care of yourself. Thanks very much for coming! Maggi... What did she want? - Oh, she's a nurse. She came to see if we needed any volunteers. She's not a nurse. She's a Lasta executive. What? No. I've seen her before. "God is the greatest!" "God is the greatest!" "God is the greatest!" Michael is a friend and a very good journalist and he is going to make a documentary film on Ayan's story! We will launch this the same day as the film comes out on German TV. We have a slot for the film in about a month... But to make a big splash we need Ayan to come back with us to Germany to do the press and the publicity. I can't leave my family here. Ayan, it's not going to be long. How long? A month, I guess. For the launch and the publicity, we need to do for the whole story to come out. So be it. Even if it takes longer. I will look after the family. Let's have some tea. Dad, am I invisible all of a sudden? You are my son. And I am proud of you. But sometimes you have to let your parents make decisions for you. Let's have tea. This is not about publicity, is it? No... If he is here when this goes public well, there are going to be a lot of angry people around. When this goes on TV in Europe, do you think...? He will come back as a hero. I promise you. And everyone will have to listen. "You are my peace of mind." "You are my serenity." "You are the reason my life is beautiful." "Although the world is..." The population is growing so fast that the potential market for formula is enormous. Five million babies are born in Pakistan every year and this number is just going to increase, so the potential hazard that this could cause is enormous. It's not just the filthy water. Parents want the western brands marketed by international companies because they make them think their kids will be smarter if they drink formula milk. But some mothers can't afford it, so they dilute it. Just one spoonful less, who's going to notice? Well the babies do. They lose weight, they get ill and die. The World Health Organisation claims breastfeeding could save up to 1.5 million babies every year. 1.5 million babies every year. "O, Lord... Lord have mercy!" "O, Lord... I bow to You!" "O Lord! "O Lord! 1.5 million babies every year. "O, Lord... Lord have mercy!" "O Lord! "I bow to You! O Lord..." Pray for me. Please do it yourself... I am not sure if my prayers will reach so far! Come here... Dad, how will you manage? Don't worry about us. I will go back and collect a few things. I mean... how can we survive without a VCR? Now this is what we call progress! Please take care! - Goodbye! Goodbye! - Goodbye! Goodbye! 'Flight QR615 on the tarmac.' 'It is taxying...' Is that for hire? In Germany, all the taxis are Mercedes? Yes. But then... what does your President drive? Your car, Mr. President. Do you agree your product should not be used where there is no safe water supply? We gave all the evidence to the institutional people... Yes or no. Yes, but listen, this is not the point we should talk. Where the people are so poor that they are going to dilute it and that's going to endanger health, it should not be used? Of course not. But like I said before, this is not the point... What is your corporate responsibility to find out the extent of the use of your product in the developing parts of the world in those circumstances? We cannot have that responsibility. - Why? We have a massive product, you see, We have thousand of babies dying... We have a product... Ayan... Look... "Scandal Um Babymilch" (Scandal in Baby Milk) Oh, this is so good. Before this problem... - Listen... listen... The people, the Pakistani people... I'm not sitting here and letting you... Who are poor... - treat me like a criminal. I am sorry! - Excuse me! I don't want to treat you like a criminal... I just want to come back to my question... - Excuse me! One thing is sure, this programme is going nowhere. - What... 'Programme promises devastating new evidence' 'of multinational companies putting profits' 'before the lives of babies." Yes... - Hey, that was great. You should be proud of yourself. This is going to be huge. I have to continue with the edit. Nervous? You're going to be great. Trust yourself. Come with me please. Why? - Come with me. Come with me. - What is it? I don't know. But we'll find out pretty soon. So, what's going on? Ayan. Listen, I want to settle this issue but I can't authorise any amount as I have to first discuss with our top management. I can't decide on this issue on my own. The company sees your action as blackmail. I want to settle this issue once and for all. And if you don't solve this those people who are behind me, they will take action. Do you understand? How much does your management have in mind? $60,000 is a big amount and requires management approval. Okay, Meet me here on Friday at 3 pm to finalise this. Is this your voice? And you had no idea? Do you think, I would have gone that far if I'd known? Come on! That's crap, we've been working on this for a month. All your evidence is from the man you have heard on that tape Michael. Excuse me Günther... What are we talking about? What is this about? It was before you came back. Before you showed me the films. 'These people could buy the whole government of Pakistan,' 'put it in a box, wrap it up with ribbons and sell it as a souvenir.' 'You can fight with them,' 'but you can't win.' 'But, if you are smart,' 'this could all work out very well for you.' 'Hello Bilal.' 'I've spoken to Ayan I would like you to talk to him.' 'Ayan.' 'Listen I want to settle this issue,' 'but I can't authorise any amount' 'as I have to first discuss with our top management.' 'I can't decide on this issue on my own.' 'The company sees your action as blackmail.' 'I want to settle this issue once and for all.' 'And if you don't solve this,' 'those people who are behind me, they will take action.' 'Do you understand?' 'How much does your management have in mind?' '$60,000 is a big amount and requires management approval.' 'Okay, meet me here on Friday at 3 pm to finalise this.' 'What's going on?' 'What is she doing here? - What do you mean?' 'Why did you bring her here?' 'Ayan... - Tell her to leave... now!' 'If you do this, we might be ruined forever' 'but if you don't do this, I'll never respect you again.' You knew there'd been talk of blackmail. "Unsubstantiated" talk about blackmail. But not that he actually set out to get the money. But he didn't take the money. That's the whole point. He never took the money! Why would Ayan have sent the Legal Notice with all his best evidence to the World Health Organisation if he was planning blackmail? I mean look. 17th of January, he writes a letter to the W.H.O asking for help. Right? 28th of january, they write back saying there's nothing they can do, copying in the local doctor. That's when everyone finds out about this. But it's nearly another month, before the meeting about the money. I mean, he'd be the most incompetent blackmailer in history. Hey I've got all this great stuff on you and I'm gonna go public on it unless you give me money. Except I've already gone public with it. I mean it doesn't make sense. It doesn't mean he wasn't going to take a pay off. Yeah, but there's a world of difference between considering a pay off and masterminding a blackmail plot. And meanwhile there were thirteen international companies selling infant formula in Pakistan. How do we convince Frank? I spent my time buying doctors. Why would I have been surprised when they wanted to buy me? But think about it. Why did they tape me? I mean I was in a military hospital, surrounded by men with guns. If they saw my actions as blackmail why didn't they arrest me? Because they didn't want your eveidence to be heard. This is stupid. I gave them the perfect reason to make sure no-one would listen to me. Ayan. Why did you not take the money? I went to my father. And he told me that no son of his would be so unprincipled. And that I would be a bloody fool to think that they would give me $60,000. So, I never went back. Ayan. I want you to know that I believe you. But they stopped the German T.V with that tape. And the same thing will happen here unless we do something. I want to include everything in the film. You gonna show me as a blackmailer a lia, a foger? Maggi told me I would return a hero. Well, I have to go to work soon. I make the best donuts in Toronto. It's a good local company. With no multinationals involved. Ayan. I'm a lawyer, I think this film is a risk. But, It is do-able, if we do this way. But we have few problems. The blackmail allegations they will make you look, forgive me, they will make you look unreliable. And they will say it's anold story. This is how old the story is. I haven't seen my wife or my children in seven years. My mother and father died, I wasn't there. Frank, this was happening in Africa in the 70's. All over Asia in the 80's and 90's and you just send a reasearcher to Pakistan to prove that this is still happening there now. It's an old story, that's alive. It keeps repeating itself. And that's why we have to make this film. Okay, but... This has to be referred up. To the very top. You do what you have to do. Hey. Hi, Frank... How are you doing? I am sorry. They won't take the risk. What? They could sue us in the High Court. Here or in Paris or Lahore. It could cost 100s of 1000s of pounds, just to prove it's true. So Ayan ruins his entire life, and you are not prepared to take a legal risk. It's my job to assess that level risk. Oh, yes, yes. And you are wonderful at your job. But that's exactly what the multinationals rely on. That we obey the rules. So they can do whatever they like. I filmed babies dying. I know this is real. I don't care what he did. You can take Ayan out of this story but the evidence still stands. And if someone in that corporation is prepared to go to these lengths to discredit him, what does that tell you? This man has risked everything. He left his family in Pakistan and now... if you don't show the programme, he can never go back. I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. Guenther please! You can't be serious you're letting them pressurise you? Who is pressurising you? Tell me! Who is pressurising you? Michael! Please calm down! - Come on tell me! Tell me now! I can't transmit it! That's nonsense we have enough evidence... "I mourn in my loneliness." "My beloved," "I feel the chill of our separation." "I mourn in my loneliness." "My beloved," "I feel the chill of our separation." "I miss your lovely voice." "Your miss your beautiful smile." "I feel the chill of our separation." "This distance" "fills my heart with tears." "Dreams of you" "fill my senses." "I surrender my dreams to you!" "I mourn in my loneliness." "My beloved," "I feel the chill of our separation." "I mourn in my loneliness." "My beloved," "I feel the chill of our separation." "I miss your lovely voice." "Your miss your beautiful smile." "I feel the chill of our separation." "This distance" "fills my heart with tears." "Dreams of you" "fill my senses."
