I can show you how intelligent I am. I can use a word like "delicatessen" and know what it means. Or "invertebrate." Or "inveterate." Or "degenerate." But all of that... ...is all part of it, because it's all part of the mind that actually flows like that, because I realize that the human mind is a three-and-a-half pound gland that pumps neurons constantly and deals with itself by responding to stimulus. That's what we're designed to do, evolving slowly. Even Darwin's going, "I have hopes! I had such high hopes!" It's all part of it, because I believe the human mind is adapting and evolving slowly but surely but I'm trying not to speak that fast, because eventually, you have to catch up. Wow. Larry Grobel: Do you have any fears? Robin: I guess it'd be that fear that if I felt like I was just becoming... not just dull, but a rock. That I still couldn't spark. Then I'd start to worry.
