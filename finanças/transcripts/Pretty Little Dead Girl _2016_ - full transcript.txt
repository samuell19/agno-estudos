Making the inferior vena cava incision now. Suction please. Clamp. The final incision in the left pulmonary is complete. Donor organ, please. Here you are, doctor. More suction. Preparing the right pulmonary. First suture is complete. Second stitch please. We've got her back. It looks like we're finished Doctor Stevens. Good work, well done. Hi. Good Morning. Hey Em. Did you get enough sleep? I'm so sick of sleeping. I've had enough sleep for a lifetime. I guess you can take a nap later, baby. I had such a weird dream last night. Oh yeah? Yeah, I was back in surgery, and there was a girl. What girl, honey? The girl. You know, the donor? Don't worry, you don't have to try to explain it again. I just want to know where my heart came from. Who the donor was. I mean, she saved my life. The Doctor saved your life, sweetie. But, I get it, I do. I wish it were possible too. You just have to remember that someone lost a child. We have to respect their privacy. Yeah. You have no idea how lucky you are. How lucky we all are. I know. Why don't you go wash up for breakfast? Oh, are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. I just got up too fast. Any chills, headaches? No. Dizziness? Mom! I said I'm fine. Okay. I'm still going to mention this at our appointment today, okay? Dr. Stevens is moving a little too fast for my taste. Too fast? Try too slow! How long am I expected to do all the chores around here? Gosh! I thought that's why people had kids. Free labor. It's not a joke, Garrett. Yes, it is, sweetheart. It's a joke my love. We're going to take it easy, we're going to follow the doctor's orders. Am I right, Em? We always do. Well, your recovery has been remarkable. Immune system is strong, no signs of rejection. When can I start doing things? I mean not that hanging out with Mom and Dad isn't every teen's dream, but... Some mild activity would probably be a good thing. Just nothing strenuous, of course. Are you sure? I feel like it's way too soon. Mom, she's the doctor! She has a degree and everything. I know honey, but I don't want to take any chances. I feel like we're rushing things. I promise you Sharon, I'm being very cautious. Some normal activity will help us know where the boundaries are. Can I go back to school? No, not yet. Nothing strenuous. No stress of any kind. But, what about debate club? They're getting clobbered. Okay, but just nothing that would normally raise the heart rate, okay? You're at about 100 beats per minute. If your body needs more oxygen, it's going to take your heart more time to provide it. You see, Emma. We have to be careful. What we have to pay attention to is any signs of rejection: fatigue, fever, chills, headaches, dizziness... Okay, okay. I'm sure Mom will keep a tight reign on you. I'm not worried. Good luck, Emma. Thanks, Dr. Stevens. You're welcome. Thank you. I got it mom! Heads up! Whoa, careful! Come on! Nice hands, Garrett. Sorry about that, Sharon. Got away from me, my fault. What'd the doctor say about going back to school? She's not quite ready yet. Bummer. Oh, Garrett. Not in the house. At least pretend you're the grown up. Hawks lost last week. Who lives in Washington and roots for the Niners? Winners do. Em, almost forgot to tell you. Tina wants you to call her back. They lost that debate. Against St. Mark's? We should have won that. Guess they just can't hack it without you. I have to call Tina and let her know I'm coming back to debate. The doctor said I could. I'll talk to you later, okay? Okay. Easy! This is not a brothel. Bye. Thanks for tossing the rock, Big G. Later. Oh, the son I'll never have. Tanya... Tanya. I owe you nothing. I'm not going to sit here and be lectured by you. I know that's what you believe, I know... The police said it was a suicide. Tanya, stop looking for someone to blame. Take some responsibility for once in your entire life. Tanya, I'm sorry, I didn't mean... Tanya? I'm sorry Tanya. I'm so sorry. Mom, are you okay? Oh, sweetheart you should be resting. Who's Tanya? Is that aunt Tanya? Let's get you back to bed. I thought you guys didn't talk anymore? She called... What happened? Nothing, everything is fine, sweetheart. Everything is just fine. Morning, Em. Hey Dad, want some eggs? Here, I'll do it. Please... stop. I think I can fry an egg at 100 beats per minute. Okay. I'm proud of you, kid. It's just an egg, Dad. Hey, can I ask you something? What is it sweetheart? How come Mom and aunt Tanya don't talk anymore? Um... I think you need to talk to your mother about that. No, but I tried. She won't talk to me! She talks at me and I heard her on the phone last night. She was really upset, but won't tell me what's wrong. Tanya... She's never been exactly stable. That's why Constance was in foster care, right? She... She wasn't really fit to care for Constance and... it got... it got really bad, so Child Protective Services stepped in. What does that have to do with Mom? She was the one who called them. I never knew that! It's not something your mother is proud of, you know? She doesn't like to think about anything to do with how Constance died. Constance committed suicide, right? How? You know, I don't really know all the details. That was around the time you got really sick and we were wrapped up in that and... Em? Yeah? The eggs are burning. Hey! How are you feeling? My Mom is driving me crazy, but... Well, at least you get some time away tomorrow. I'm so glad you're coming back to debate club. I'm so tired of losing. That's actually why I called. I really need to talk to you about something. You could also help me come up with questions for next month's guest speaker. I was hoping you could do a big favor and cover for me tomorrow. There's something I really have to do. Sure, what's up? I'll tell you about it later. Oooh. Mysterious. Yeah, well, thank you so much. You're a life saver. Aunt Tanya? Sharon send you? She doesn't know I'm here. What do you want from me? No one will tell me the truth. You came to me? Seems like you know the truth already. Sharon was always such a liar. I barely saw my Constance after they took her away from me, because your mom told all those lies. I'm sorry. She said I was unfit. I didn't know. She wanted this to happen. Sharon always gets what she wants. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come. Did she want to show me how strong you are now? Rub my face in it? No. I wanted to come because... I wanted to know how Constance died. I'll tell you this: it wasn't suicide. You don't get into heaven if you commit suicide. Are you saying that my little girl's not in heaven? No, I should go. You don't deserve it! I have to go! You stole my little girl's heart! You took everything from me! I didn't mean to. What the hell were you thinking, going there alone? Going there at all, with no idea what you're walking into. How dare you put this on me? You lied to me! I never lied. She was my cousin! Her heart is in my body! It's okay. Calm down. Breathe. It's my body. Let's call the doctor. You had no right. Don't! This is exactly why we didn't tell you. It's too much to bear. That's not true. You didn't tell me because you didn't want to deal with it. All that matters is that you're alive. It doesn't matter where the heart came from. It does to me. Excuse me, Detective Roberts? Yeah, that's her. Excuse me, detective? Uh huh. Hi, sorry, are you Detective Roberts? Yes. The sergeant at the front said I could talk to you about a closed case file? Did you check the website? Yes, there's a case number but there's no police report. And did you check with Records Request? They sent me up to you. They said that nothing has been turned in yet. Just make it quick, because I'm buried right now. One guy got promoted. One guy retired, and all of this got dumped on me. Here. I think this is it. Yeah, here. All right. Let's see. There was a 911 call. EMTs found her in a car with the engine running. Carbon monoxide poisoning. There were lots of drugs in her system. Never regained consciousness. Ruled a suicide at the scene. Case closed, I really can't tell you more than that. I was hoping to talk to somebody who knew her. Was she living there? At the Waterman Condo Plaza? What is this all about about? Who is she to you? I'm a heart transplant recipient, and she's the donor and... and also my cousin. Okay. This has her last known address on 2nd in Belltown. You probably shouldn't go there alone. Why was she there at the condo? I don't know. Maybe it's a friend's place? Usually we canvas the neighbors and get security footage, but half of this file isn't even here. In this job you're always prioritizing resources, I just... She wasn't a priority. It's not that, it's that this is a textbook suicide. Well, thanks for your time, detective. Did they really find her in the car, with the engine running? That's what it says in here, yeah. Well the person who called 911, why didn't... why didn't they pull her out of the car? Um, I don't have a transcript of the call, but maybe someone just smelled exhaust. Or it could just be a sloppy EMT report. It's usually something simple. Well thanks again, detective. Hey, hey! I'm sorry, about your cousin. Can I help you? Uh... um... I might have known somebody who used to live here. You think they used to live here or you think you knew them? Both. Sorry, do you happen to know a Constance Jones? What? She owe you money? I'm her cousin. Constance hasn't lived here in a long time. She never lived anywhere very long. You're not Emma, are you? Yeah. How did you know that? Constance didn't have many good memories, but she talked about you. I'm Seth, by the way. That's a real firm handshake you got there. She left all this stuff here. Junk mostly, but I didn't want to throw it out. I still can't believe it. I mean, she was crazy and reckless, but suicide? It doesn't make any sense. Yeah. They usually say if someone really wants do it, they don't talk about it. They just do it. Yeah? But Constance had plans. She was always talking about the future. Making her own luck. It's one of the things I loved best about her. She was a fighter. She survived her mom, foster care. She was a fighter, she wouldn't... she wouldn't just... I made this for you. Do you think there was some kind of mistake? Maybe. There's some things that just don't add up. Like what? The 911 call. Why didn't they stop to help her? And then the condo. What was she doing there? I'm going to go out there to check it out. You want to come with me? Uh... Hey, how was debate club? My point is just simple. If you're going to leave class, you have to let someone know. Mom, I already told you. Tina and I were talking, we lost track of time. It's not big deal. It is a big deal, Emma. How can I get through to you on this? Stop trying to get through and just talk to me. I am trying to talk to you. I'm not made of glass, Mom! She doesn't trust me now. It's just teenage rebellion. It'll blow over. You have no idea what I'm going through. You shouldn't have said anything. She has a right to know! We agreed Garett! No, you agreed. What do you want me to do? You want me to lie to her? Morning, sweetheart. Sorry about last night. Everyone just over-reacted. Dad and I talked it out and everything is fine now, okay? We just need better communication, that's all. Okay. Hey, is Mark coming over? I was thinking I'd make cookies! I'm not supposed to have those yet. I'll use egg whites. I'm sure one won't raise your triglycerides. Let me know if you need anything. So Randall almost blew the game for us, I didn't let that happen, obvi. Coach said I was pretty much super human in the fourth quarter. I'll take two. So anyway, I pull a swim move on a doofy tackle and... Em? Hmm? You gonna take a card? Oh no, I fold. Why'd you fold? You have me beat. I don't know. Cookies are ready! Awesome! You want one? You know, you could try a little harder. I can't take any more super human fourth quarter. You think I wanna talk football constantly? I'm just trying to be polite. He's your boyfriend. You want a cookie? Hey, come on babe! Don't you want a cookie? No, I don't want a stupid cookie. Hey, I don't deserve that. What's going on? Nothing, I'll be in my room. Emma, I asked you a question. Do you know where Constance died? Yes. I know you have some image of her as this free spirit, but that's just not who she was. You don't know who she was! Dredging up the past is not going to help Constance, but it could hurt you, and after everything I've been through, I just can't let that happen. I'm so sick of hearing how hard this has been on you. I'm the one with the scar down the chest. I'm the one who can't run, or breathe, or do anything. It's me! Just a reminder to have your questions prepared for next week's guest speaker: County Prosecutor Peter Harken! Hey! Hey! I thought we'd start with disclosure and maybe try and tackle... Tina, I'm sorry... Again? Your mom really freaked me out last time. I'm sorry, I... You know I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important. Please? Fine. Thank you, thank you, thanks. Gotta go! We're gonna lose! What're you guys working on? Hey. Oh, hey. I was beginning to wonder if I was in the right place. Yeah it's pretty swanky, huh? What was she doing here? You guys ever come to this part of town? No way. Can't afford it. So what do we do? Storm the place? Let's see if anyone recognizes her. Oh, yes. Such a sweet girl. So you'd seen her before? Yeah, we're on the same floor. In the building? We always seemed to be on the elevator at the same time. I never knew her name, but she was always very nice. And she's the one who was in that parking garage business? Such a sweet girl. Do you know what apartment she was in? 1503 I think it was, 03 or 04. It's the one on the southwest corner. The biggest one with the best views. I'm stuck looking at the building across the street. I bet the people watching must be interesting. You have no idea. Thank you for helping us, Ms. Keller. Of course, and I'm sorry about your friend. Such a tragedy. She wasn't visiting anyone. She lived here! How could she possibly afford it? Maybe she got a really good paying job. Do you know what kind of job you'd need to pay for a place like this? Constance didn't even graduate high school. Maybe she had roommates? Only one way to find out. We are unavailable to take your call. What now? What now? Now we use this! Did you steal those from Mrs. Keller? Don't worry. She'll think she lost them. The doorman will let her back in, we'll leave them at her door when we leave. Yeah? Come on, it'll be fine. What're you doing? Trying to pick the lock. No, somebody could see you! Then you better keep a look out. Where'd you learn how to do that? I'm not from your neighborhood. Did you hear that? They make these a little sturdier than I'm used to. You okay? No... Yes... I think I just need... I think I just need to sit down. Hey, almost there. What if there's a... What if there's an alarm? Then we will probably go to jail. Got it! Emma! Hey hey hey. It's all right okay? It's all right. Come on, come on. Let's get you up. Come on, sit down. Here. Thanks. What was that? It's nothing. I don't know, it's probably just like low blood sugar or something. Oh. Sorry. No, it's fine. I'm probably going to have a heart attack, but it's fine. Would you look at this place? It's incredible. Yeah, it must cost a fortune. Hey, you're not going to believe this! What? What is it? It's you. You can open it. It's got your name on it. Dear Emma Miller, the state of Washington school board is pleased to inform you that your general education development test results were sufficient to grant a high school equivalency credential. She changed her name? And she got a GED. I told you she was turning her life around. Why me? Why my name? You were probably the only normal person she ever knew. Why would she want to be normal? Nobody's been here in a while. I don't think it'll be missed. I'm not supposed to. Here's to breaking the rules. We're breaking enough rules just by being here right now. C'mon! Never had champagne before? Not really. Have you? No, but then I'm not rich. I'm not rich! Believe me, you're rich. I guess Constance was too, living here. You okay? I don't know. I just... I suddenly feel like I didn't know her at all. I mean, how could she pull all this off? Maybe it's just like you said. Maybe she made her own luck. Well, there's luck and then there's luck. It just doesn't make sense. I don't think she lived here alone. Hey Seth? Seth? Hey Seth? Seth? Guess you were right. She finally found a job that where she could afford a place like this. What do you mean? This could... No, we don't know what this means. Sure we do. Maybe she met somebody. This could be his apartment. He pays for it, but he doesn't live here. Maybe after she died, he... What? He was too heartbroken to come back? Don't be so naive, Emma. This? This isn't a love story. He'll be back when he finds a replacement. No, we don't know anything. No! You don't know anything! Because you didn't really know Constance either, did you? I'm just surprised I didn't figure it out sooner. You haven't figured anything out. I know enough. Seth? Detective Roberts. Anderson. Hey, yeah, it's Roberts. I need some help on a closed case. Because I do. File number 3263827. I need a transcript for the 911 call, or a recording if we've got it. No, no, I also need the EMT reports. What? Pretty please with sugar on top. Thanks. She wasn't a prostitute, if that's what you're thinking. She once lent me like $1,000. I was taking this locksmithing course. She came up with the cash. I found out later that she pawned a diamond bracelet for the money. You wanna guess where she got a diamond bracelet worth $1,000? But you said she had plans and she was turning her life around. That she made her own luck, starting a new life? I say some pretty stupid things. I didn't think she could have done it. But then again, I never thought she could have done this. And when I really think about it, when she didn't like something, she just stopped. That was it for her, no going back. She stopped what? She killed herself, Emma. She liked to pretended she was so free. But she was just scared like the rest of us. She couldn't face what she was, so she stopped. Constance was a good person. She was strong and a fighter and everything that I'm not. And she lived here in this amazing place and was putting her pieces back together. Well, like I said... she never lived anywhere for very long. Hey, I'm sorry... I'm sorry, mom. I never should've... Stop Em, just stop. I ran into Constance about a year and a half ago. Downtown. I had just gotten word that you were bumped further down the donor list. I was a mess. And there she was. So you knew about the man? I knew that she was in trouble. What happened, Emma? What did you see? It doesn't matter now. She's not who I thought she was. I'm not who I thought I was. I'm so proud of you. For what, mom? You're the strongest person I know. Mom... You've been through so much. If I could take it all from you onto myself, I would. But after all of it, we're so distant. And I just missed you so much. Well, I'm not crazy about your stress test levels, but everything else is progressing better. What about the nerve growth? The renerve-ation or however you say that? I never get it right. Re-innervation. But that can take years, if it happens at all. I mean that doesn't matter, right? You don't really feel with your heart anyway. Well, I'm sure you've been pushing it a little, so if we can bring those levels back into target, we can start talking about returning to school in a few weeks. What's wrong? Nothing, I mean I am really glad. I'm just excited to be getting back to normal, that's all, yeah. Hello? Yes. I'm sorry, who is this? Just a sec. Honey? Seth is on the phone? Seth? I'm sorry, Emma's not available right now. Can I take a message? Oh, dope! Seth, I just can't talk right now. Emma, you never call me back. This is important. Well this is important, too. I'm sorry, I have to go. No, no, wait, wait, wait. Remember that guy in the photo with Constance? I can't do this, Seth. Look it doesn't matter why she did it anymore. No, that's just it. What if she didn't commit suicide? I can't. I just can't, I'm sorry. Don't hang up! Em, get over here! He's won 80% of his court appearances. He's amazing. Listen, I've got the easy job here. I understand you all are taking on St. Mark's in the State Finals. That's a challenge. Okay, all right. Honestly, debate is not about the issues. Memorizing judicial rulings and foreign policy is all fine, but debate is about tenacity. Your passion, your commitment, that is what will earn you the win. Thank you! Over here. Young lady, do you have a question for me? Miss, is there something you want to ask me? Please. Um. My name is Emma Miller. Well... Miss Miller. It's very nice to meet you. We've been studying the evidence. We've been studying the Ethics of Evidentiary Discovery, and I was wondering what your thoughts were on the morality of withholding evidence. Well, as I'm sure you understand, Miss Miller, Morality and Ethics are two very different things. Well what if there was a suicide... And you knew something about it, but you didn't say anything? Well, that's a very specific question. But I think I can get to the heart of your question, which for me is all about integrity. Now in debate, we endeavor to have our facts straight before we speak. But someone shouldn't be judged on whether or not they make mistakes, rather, their faithfulness to a deeper truth. I feel I always have the deeper truth on my side. Next question. Emma? What the heck was that about? Hey, babe, catch! Not now, Mark. Wait, what? What did I do? Nothing, you're perfect. Thank you, thank you. Just really not for me. Wait, what? I can't do this anymore. Emma, wait up! What the hell did I do? What's going on? All-American boyfriend, debate prep, ivy league future, it's not me. What are you talking about? This whole thing is a game. It's not real life. This is life, and it's real. Em, it's who you are. No, not anymore. Emma! Seth? Seth please let me in, I really need to talk to you. Are you in there and just not answering? Because that would be a really crappy thing to do. Mr. Harken would like a word. No, I'm not trying to be difficult, sir. I didn't want these files in the first place, but I'm supposed to complete them and turn them in. Yeah... Well, EMT reports, canvassing reports, 911 transcripts, security footage... Yes... No, well I'm told they do exist sir, but I'm not allowed to have them... I don't know. Yes, I already have a records request on this file... Uh huh... Okay. Thank you sir. I think you and I should have a little chat before you embarrass yourself. You can speak freely with me. I'm sure you can understand, a man in my position, there's not much I don't know or can't find out. You were a lot more talkative back there in front of that audience. What was it you were trying to accomplish anyway? What is it you want? Justice. Justice? Such righteous indignation. Let me ask you something: is it justice that my little girl should lose her father? Constance was somebody's daughter, too. Now that's a poor choice of argument. I knew a thing or two about her childhood. See, Constance and I, we were very close. Now that may seem silly to you. A man of my age... You know, I always really just thought of us as good friends. Is that what you told your wife? So there it is. That's what this is really all about. I think you'll discover that I am not easily intimidated. Do you think I'm trying to intimidate you? Intimidate. Threaten. Blackmail. I want you to pay for what you did to Constance. What I did to her? I gave her everything! I gave her jewelry, I gave her clothing, I gave her a lifestyle far beyond her means, and even that wasn't enough. So you just threw her away, like trash? You're obviously very distraught over the death of your cousin. Let me give you a ride, I'll... I'm not distraught, I'm angry! The difference between you and I is when I get angry, I can be an extremely dangerous man. So... you should let me see you home safe, and after that, I don't expect to ever hear from you again. I'll walk. She's only been missing for four hours. Tina, I need you to tell me the truth! If you know where Emma is, I need you to tell me right now! Where could she have gone? I understand your procedures, but my daughter has a medical condition. She could be dead in 24 hours. Do you understand? Mom? Oh my baby! You had us worried sick. Oh, you're freezing. Garrett, get the blanket. Honey, where have you been? I know. You know what? I know what happened to Constance. Emma. She was murdered. Baby, that's not what happened. Yes it is. She was having an affair with the County Prosecutor. Emma! No... He killed her and made it look like suicide. You've got to stop this, Emma! He's going to get away with murder! Stop this right now! Doesn't it matter that your niece was murdered? Don't you care? Nobody was there for her. And nobody cares that somebody killed her. She deserves justice. Emma? Are you okay? Emma! Move! You can do this, You can do this! Just a couple minutes! Stay with us! You can do this! Come on, stay with us! You can do this! Dr. Stevens is right here. Tell me what happened. I don't know, she was just out... walking. Was she upset or agitated? She, just uh... We were arguing. Then what happened? I don't know. She just collapsed... For how long? Not long, 5-10 minutes before the ambulance arrived, You guys need to wait here. Okay. They got you baby! They got you, stay with us! They got you. Oh god... take me instead! Hey, honey. You're awake. Breakfast is on the way. Ugh. No, it doesn't look too bad. And it'll make Dr. Stevens happy. I'll try. Okay. I love you, sweetie. Love you. I'll let them know you're awake. Okay. Hey Mom, can we talk about Constance now? Honey, now is not the time to get into that. Talking about Constance is what got you back in here. So, let's not hear any more about that, okay? But Mom... No one is more sorry about what happened to Constance, but there's nothing I can do about it now. But mom, she... Emma, stop! I want you to think of her heart, as the very real gift that it was. That it is, to you and me and your dad. And the rest of it, I just want us to put it in the past, where it belongs. Okay? Yeah. Good girl. I'm gonna go check on that breakfast. Okay. Come on, Seth. Answer! The wireless customer you are calling is unavailable. Your mom says yours is broken, so I made this for you. Thank you. Any more conspiracy theories? It's not funny, Garrett. I agree. I just... I'd like to know where she gets an idea like that. So would I. Maybe it's the lack of oxygen? I think we should talk to her about it. No, that's not a good idea. Garrett... I'm so scared. I'm utterly terrified all the time. Hey, look at you all dressed in non-pajama clothes. You feeling better? Yeah, actually. I was thinking of going over to Tina's for a while today. Um... Sweetheart, you're grounded. Why? There are boundaries and when you cross them, there are consequences. I've been in the hospital for days. I can't leave the house? Look, you were in the hospital because you broke the rules. People break the rules all the time. I'm the only one who has to pay for anything, Mom. She should see the hospital bill. Mark! Hey! Hey, thank you so much for doing this. Grounded, huh? What'd you do? Accused the county prosecutor of murder. Yeah, I guess that would do it. What's going on? I'll explain later, but I promise you it's not as fun as sneaking out for a concert, that's for sure. Yeah, that was a fun night. Yeah. Even if your mom did wanna murder me. Yeah, she did. So are we like... like broken up? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, felt like we were... growing apart. I'm really sorry Mark, you're a really great guy. But can we please talk about this later? I really have to go right now. Yeah, cool. Let's kick it. Emma... Hey Emma! Where you going? Seth! Where have you been? I've been calling you like a 100 times! In jail. What? Yeah, they pulled my prints from Harken's condo. He knows. Yeah! They kept asking me where I was the night Constance died. So if the suicide story crumbles, they've got a handy little scapegoat to take the fall. Wait! How did you know about Harken? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Well there's a lot you haven't told me. A heart transplant? How did you find out? Your name came up. Some detective named Roberts. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get you into this. Is it hers? Hey, it's okay. I mean, I'm glad Constance didn't die for nothing. Harken killed her didn't he? Maybe he was trying to cover an affair from his wife and his kid... We have to do something. There's nothing we can do. He's the cops, he's the lawyers, he's judges... hell, he's everybody! That's not the way it's supposed to be! Yeah, well that's the way it is. Listen, I'm actually really glad I got to see you. I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye. What do you mean? I lost my job. I can't pay rent, so I'm getting out of town for awhile. It'll just look like you're running. Can't fight city hall, right? I know how to get Harken. Emma, there is no getting Harken. All we have to do is get into his condo. You need a brain transplant. I just spent the night in jail for doing that exact thing. Do you still have the keys? No. I didn't mean to, I just... I forgot, really. I was going to give them back, eventually. Put them in the mail slot or something. Look! I'm lucky the cops didn't find these on me. These will get you in the building, not in the door. Which is why I need you to come with me. I'm not setting foot near that place. Okay. I'm still going, whether you help me out or not. All right, it's all clear. Thanks. What now? Go to the cops. I'm starting to think that heart is possessing you. The longer you've have it, the crazier you get. Go to my mom. Have her call Detective Roberts. And say what? That I'm possessed and broke into the County Prosecutor's apartment. Emma, I am not leaving you here. Hey relax, I've got a plan. But I need Detective Roberts. I won't do anything until she gets here, okay? Please go. If they find you here, we'll both be sharing a cell. It's fine, I promise you. I've got everything taken care of. Promise. Can you please fill me in? Not right now, just go. Is that my file? I just deliver 'em! Oh, finally. 911, what is your emergency? There's a girl... I'll be damned! Come quickly. It's a suicide. Ma'am? Are you still there? Hi yeah, it's me. No. Yeah, yes. Thank you. Shut the hell up. Did you get my security camera footage? Waterman Plaza, the suicide, come on, how many times... Yes, yes, the parking garage. You do! Okay yes, thank you! With sugar on top. Yes, I'll be right up. It's a suicide. Ma'am? Are you still there? Are you still there. Ma'am? How did you get this number? I believe I warned you about making me angry. We've got unfinished business. Once we iron out the details of our financial settlement, we can see if there's anymore pleasant business to attend to. I think you know where to find me. 911, what is your emergency? There's a girl... come quickly. It's a suicide. Ma'am? Are you still there? Are you still there? Ma'am? 911, what is your emergency? There's a girl... come quickly. It's a suicide. Ma'am? Are you still there? Are you still there? Ma'am? 911, what is your emergency? There's a girl... come quickly. Emma, I made you a cup of that tea you like. What is your emergency? There's a girl... come quickly. It's a suicide. Ma'am? Are you still there? Are you still there? Ma'am? 911, what is your emergency? There's a girl... come quick... Yes, she's 5'5", she's got brown hair, brown eyes, a slight build, and... I don't know. She's been gone for two, maybe three hours... Wait, where are you going? I can't just sit here. I'm going to look for her. Umm, Mrs. Miller? Yes? I'm Seth, I'm a friend of Emma's. Where is she? She wanted you to call this detective. Tell her to go to Waterman Plaza. What? What do you think you're doing? Shame to waste nice things. Take that off. Business first. Look, I don't know what game you're playing here, but I... No games, I saw an opportunity and I'm taking it. I will not be blackmailed. Don't think of it like that. It's an arrangement. You have things I want, I have things you want, it's economics. And what do you have that you think I want? My silence, for one. The rest is negotiable. Take a seat, get comfortable. I need a drink. You want one? Yeah, that's a great idea. Honey, what the hell is going on? Call the detective on this card. Tell her to go to Waterman Plaza now! No! Wait, wait! Where are you going? I should've listened to what she was saying. I just kept hoping it would all go away. I have to stop her! Sharon, you can't just... If he thinks she's a real threat... I will not let him hurt her. Honey, wait! Sharon, just wait! Sharon, wait! Sharon, wait! What are you... Sharon! Thank you. You look so much like her, dressed like that. Take a seat, you're making me nervous. You should be nervous. You're playing a very dangerous game. I already told you, I'm not playing a game. What are you, 18? Because you're either incredibly brave, or incredibly naive. Another similarity between the two of you. She was such a pain in the ass, sometimes. Demanding, spiteful, reckless. She just had such a strong will. I couldn't say no to her. That girl had me running in circles. Well, that must have been infuriating. Oh, she was infuriating. Yeah, but that was part of her appeal. I guess I liked it at first. At first? Take a seat, get comfortable. I'm going to go freshen up, okay? Roberts. This is Garrett Miller. My wife and Emma need help. Excuse me? They're going to Waterman Plaza. Did you say Waterman Plaza? Yes! Peter Harken's apartment. Peter Harken. Yeah, I'll be right there. Hi, this is Detective Roberts. I need uniform backup to 1600 Waterman Plaza. Yes ma'am. Another drink? No, I don't think so. Tell me, what is this all about? I mean really, what is it you're after? A hundred thousand dollars. What? And a summer internship. Not in your office, obviously. That would be weird. I'm not sure this is such a good idea. Wait! Maybe I should just come clean about all of this. Just get it all out in the open. Aren't you afraid? Of course I'm afraid. My wife would take everything I have, my career would be over. You would go to prison! I've got a few allies. I'm pretty sure I could stave off a statutory rape charge. I think you're forgetting why we're here. I know the whole story. I know what happened. What're you talking about? The suicide! I know... What about the suicide? Wait a sec, what're you suggesting exactly? Let go, you're hurting... I'm gonna do a lot more than that if you don't tell me what you think you know. You think I murdered her? Let go! Damn it, I just had this suit dry cleaned! Uh.. I'm sorry. Look at this! What is that? Umm, it's just... What the hell is this? Just my... I don't... I don't know... it's just... You little bitch! Are you trying to frame me? No, I wasn't... Get the hell away from my daughter! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't shoot! Mom! You okay, baby? I'm okay. Mom, what're you... put the gun down. You need to leave now. Get out of here. No! I'm not done here... Listen to me, just put the gun down. Okay? I didn't touch your daughter. Mom, what are you doing? You're scaring me. I'm not going to tell you again, Emma. Get out of here, now! No, no, no! Don't you go! Shut up! Don't say a word. Let's go! Mom, what're you doing? You're scaring me! I need to finish this, but I can't do it with you here. All we do is get him to confess on the camera, and then we've got him. What? Go home Emma, now! No, don't you leave! If you do, she's gonna kill me! I told you to shut up! Mom, this isn't the way. Yes, he killed Constance, but if we kill him, we're no better than he is. Wait! Listen to me! I didn't kill anybody, okay! I didn't do a thing, okay! I didn't do anything! Just don't! Call the police, I've got a kid, I... Mom... mom! If he killed her, and I kill him... Mom... Then it's over. You don't have to. Freeze! Don't move. Thank god. Don't get too excited Mr. Harken, you're next. For what? For starters? Obstruction of justice, statutory rape, assault of a minor, and tampering with evidence in a capital murder case. Murder? Sharon Miller, you're under arrest for the attempted murder of Peter Harken... No, no, no, she was just trying to protecting me! And for the murder of Constance Jones. What? You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you... No, he's the one! Can and will be used against you in a court of law. He murdered Constance. No, that's not true! That is absolutely not true! I'm so sorry, Emma. You have the right to speak to an attorney. I'm so sorry, I'd do anything for you. You have the right to have an attorney present at all questioning. What's going on? I'd die for you. Do you understand these rights as I've read them to you? I'd kill for you. No! What's happening? Take her. I've got her. It's okay. Look at me. I couldn't just let my daughter die. I had to save her. I had to keep our family together. I didn't have a choice. I knew right away when I saw her. I had just gotten the bad news. Those waiting lists are a kind of torture. I was downtown, I was just sitting there on a bench, crying, not sure if I'd be able to get up. And there she was. Even before I knew what a mess she'd made of her life, I knew what I had to do. It was perfectly clear. She was a relative. A blood match. I did my research on the best way to put her to sleep without damaging the organs. I held her and told her everything would be all right. I told her she'd never have to go back to that life. She thanked me. She actually thanked me. It was fate. I knew they'd have to get to her quickly. Keep the heart beating so it wouldn't be damaged by the carbon monoxide. It was a terrible risk. I couldn't help feeling that Constance knew. She knew why I was really there that night. 911, what is your emergency? There's a girl... come quickly. It's a suicide. Ma'am? Are you still there? Her life was already over. My baby could still be saved. Unbelievable. I... I don't even know her. I don't even recognize my own wife. How could I not know? I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Miller. The 911 call and the EMT reports had me convinced there was murder. And then once I saw the security footage, I had a pretty good guess on who she was. I thought I was sending you after Harken. Well, Harken didn't want his name in the headlines, but he thought he was covering up an affair, not a murder. What do we do with this? How do we go on from here? I can't imagine what the two of you are going through. And I know this isn't much consolation, but you did right by your cousin. She deserved better. My heart's broken. I'm really sorry. I knew we could do it once we had our ringer back. This belongs to all of us. Whoo! Go Xavier! Come check it out. Dad, I didn't know you were going to make it. Well, neither did I, but then someone had to uh... tell this guy where you were. Hey! What? I thought you left town? Yeah, I did, but I came back. I got a job. A locksmith, if you can believe it. Apprentice anyway. That's so great. Yeah, plus there's a girl that lives here that I'm kinda stuck on. Yeah? Yeah, I think it's doomed to fail though. I'm never going to win an argument against a debate champion. Well, maybe if you're a little nicer to her, maybe she'd let you win one. So... how are you holding up? I'm all right. I mean, I'm a survivor after all, so... And the heart? It hurts. I'm sorry. No, it's a good thing. It means I can feel it again, so... yeah. Hey... wanna get out of here? Like a date? Yeah, I don't know. We could break into a couple more condos? Maybe the Mayor? Or the Attorney General? How about a little something less strenuous. Aw! Come on. I thought you had the heart of a rebel? I do! Do you? Well, maybe. We'll find out!
