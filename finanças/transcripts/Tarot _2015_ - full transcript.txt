Hitmaker Studios presents Produced by Rocky Soraya A film by Jose Poernomo So what about you? Are you coming back to Jakarta with me? After all, weâ€™ve graduated college. Iâ€™m going back, for sure. I want to work there. Youâ€™re coming, right? Jules? You donâ€™t have to cling to bitter memories in Jakarta. Iâ€™m sure your parents wouldnâ€™t have wanted you to stay this way forever. I know. But you understand my reason. Yes, I understand. But you canâ€™t stay away forever. Forever is a long time. Besides, I thought you wanted to reopen the bookstore. Your fatherâ€™s bookstore has been abandoned for years. And Iâ€™ll be there, too. I will always be by your side. Every day and every second. Because youâ€™ll be my life partner forever. Julie, I love you Will you marry me? - Letâ€™s go in there. - What for? Come on. Please. - Hello. Welcome. - Hi. - My name is Madame Herlina. - Okay. Please, sit down. Hi. My name is Julie and this is Tristan Let me guess. Youâ€™re getting married, right? Yes. How did you know? I saw it in the cards last week. According to the cards, a young couple would come in here and ask me to read their future married life. So how about it? Can you start reading our cards now? I only read Tarot cards. Whichever cards come out of the deck, they will tell your future. Are you ready? Donâ€™t look so tense! Choose ten cards. Two more. A new beginning. A happy couple. Your marriage will have the blessing of everyone you know. Youâ€™re inseparable from each other. - Congratulations. - Amen to that. And you have a talent. A talent you want to hide from everyone, including yourself. Well, donâ€™t. Itâ€™s a special talent. In time, youâ€™ll feel the same way. But before that happens. Someone will come to you and demand for justice. Justice according to them. Death. Someone will come from the past. And you wonâ€™t be able to stop them from coming. They will disturb your life. Something dangerous. You must exercise extreme caution. And. This concerns the people around you. Not just the two of you. This is a warning. A warning for your future, which... ...I canâ€™t see here. The person whoâ€™s coming from the past... ...will kill one of you. And the lives of two other people. Good friends from the past. I canâ€™t tell you the reason why. But someone was hurt. They are resentful. They are disappointed and angry. They feel thereâ€™s a price to be paid. Pain for pain. Life for life. Either you pay with your own life, or the life of someone you love. Iâ€™m sorry, Maâ€™am. Weâ€™re here to get a happy reading. And we donâ€™t appreciate you trying to scare us with all these mumbo-jumbo crap. But that was what I saw. Most people will advise you not to take card readings seriously. That they arenâ€™t to be trusted, because theyâ€™re not always right. But my readings are always accurate. Always. Honey. Come on, donâ€™t let it bother you. Sheâ€™s out of her mind. Look, we donâ€™t have to worry about the readings. As long as we love each other. Everything she said is bullshit. She said something... About a hidden talent that you have. Do you have any idea what sheâ€™s talking about? How would I know? I told you, sheâ€™s crazy. Come now. I love you. We need springroll wrappers, and Balinese rice. Chop, chop! Bye now, Sabrina. - Thank you, Coach. - Okay. How are you, Miss? - Iâ€™m fine. - Please, come in. You look beautiful wearing the ribbon Thank you, Julie. Miss. Your room is ready, Miss. Thank you. Would it be okay then if I take my leave now Where are you going? You live here, donâ€™t you? I donâ€™t live here, anymore, Miss. Usually when it gets dark, I go back to my sisterâ€™s. Whatâ€™s wrong with staying here? Iâ€™m scared of living here by myself. This house just doesnâ€™t feel the same, anymore. Okay. Thank you so much. Be safe on the road. Iâ€™ll leave now. Honey. What are you making? A veggie dish, I bet. Donâ€™t you remember I decided to become a vegetarian two weeks ago? Ah, thatâ€™s right. Maybe sometimes you can cook a meat dish for me? And you can still have your vegetables. If Iâ€™m the one doing the cooking, then Iâ€™ll cook whatever I want. I thought you said you loved me. Yes, I do love you. Here. Honey. Weâ€™re out of salt. Are you serious? Didnâ€™t we buy some already? All right. Iâ€™ll go get some. - Okay. - Bye. Honey? Stop kidding around. Itâ€™s not funny. Tristan? Honey, where are you hiding? Behind the curtain, under the table? Where? I donâ€™t want to play this game. Itâ€™s not funny. Jules, what are you talking about? Iâ€™m at the supermarket. What else do you need other than salt? Iâ€™ll get it. Jules? Hello? I donâ€™t need anything else. Whatâ€™s going on with you? I thought I heard someone come into the house. I heard a door open. I thought it was you. It must have been the wind. Iâ€™ll be back soon. Okay. Did you lock the door? Please stop kidding around. What are you talking about? Whatever. What? Jules. Iâ€™m serious. Everyoneâ€™s talking about it. They also made this. Here. Itâ€™s been distributed to entire school. The Beast in the Beautiful Clique We canâ€™t be friends with Sofia. If we hang out with her, weâ€™ll ruin our reputation. Our popularity will go down the drain. And people will look at us weird. Sofia is my sister. Sheâ€™s my twin. So, please. Stop talking about her face. But thatâ€™s exactly her problem. Unless sheâ€™s getting a plastic surgery very soon. But you told us yourself, thereâ€™s nothing they can do with her face. Because itâ€™s a birth defect. Right? If you wish to hang out with her at home, thatâ€™s fine. But she canâ€™t hang out with us at school. Hey! Hi. Let's go, Jules. I said, let's go. You again. Hereâ€™s your book. Why are you doing this? Here. Sorry. You canâ€™t even get your own book. How sad. Ouch. We want to hang out with Jules, not you. So stay away from us. And you canâ€™t tell Jules what we told you. Unless youâ€™re looking to get tortured by us. Bye! Sofia, are you home? I was looking for you. What happened to you? Please, open the door. You donâ€™t have to pretend to care about me. I donâ€™t understand you, Sofia. Why did you lock your sister in all day? Do you want her dead? I wanted her to know what it feels like to be ugly. And to be despised by everybody. Weâ€™re doing this for you. We want you to be safe. Besides, my sister wants you to live with her. Bye, Mom, Dad. Hello? Whereâ€™s Mom? Iâ€™d like to talk to her. I miss her. Sheâ€™s gone. I know sheâ€™s there. I just talked to her, but we got cut off. Sheâ€™s very ill. Iâ€™d like to talk to her. Stay in Bogor. Donâ€™t call here. Iâ€™m happy here without you. Iâ€™m coming to Jakarta tomorrow. So you... If you ever come back, Iâ€™ll kill myself. Youâ€™ve taken everything from me. Love, compassion, romance, youâ€™ve taken it all. If you ever come back here again, Iâ€™d rather kill myself and die. Before you take it all from me again. Fine. Whatever you want So youâ€™ll stop feeling like the unluckiest person in the world. So youâ€™ll realize I have never taken anything from you. Where should I put these? What are those? These are old books that your father bought some time ago. I think he was going to sell these, because theyâ€™re still in good condition. Just place them there. Yes, dear? Itâ€™s all set. Your mother and I have taken care of the catering and the venue. I just have to find my wedding gown tomorrow. Yes, dear. Bye. Well, itâ€™s your fault for not coming with me tomorrow. Now I feel nervous. It doesnâ€™t matter what you wear, youâ€™ll look beautiful. My mother is not going to make a big deal out of what you wear. I know. But I donâ€™t want to look odd or wear the wrong costume in front of your mother. Lest she thinks awful things about me. She wonâ€™t do such thing. My motherâ€™s very laid back. Just wear something comfortable, okay? Now go to bed. Have you had dinner yet? No. But Iâ€™ve taken a shower. Thatâ€™s what you always do, take a shower late at night before going to bed. But you always forget to eat. Okay, honey. Iâ€™ll eat. Wait. Let me call you back. Hello? Honey, whatâ€™s going on? I couldnâ€™t reach you on your mobile. I know. The batteryâ€™s dead. My mother has been trying to call you. Anyway, Iâ€™m on my way to pick you up. Honey? Jules? Okay. Yes, yes. Hello. Welcome to our boutique. Weâ€™re here to find a wedding gown. Can we look at the selections? Hold on a moment. Here, please. This is our new design. You can try it on now. Itâ€™s simple, elegant and luxurious. Itâ€™s beautiful and simple. Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll look gorgeous on you. Julie. You should try it on. Go on. Please, take her to the changing room. Miss, Iâ€™ll step out for a minute, okay? I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s been happening to me. Something doesnâ€™t feel right. I feel like somethingâ€™s following me. And I feel like thereâ€™s someone inside the house. Do you think you can help me? Let me look at the cards. Itâ€™s the same as before. Someoneâ€™s coming from the past and they have a bone to pick with you. But now I can see clearly. This person is dead. And that person is still around. Lately, theyâ€™ve been disturbing you. And they didnâ€™t die a normal death. Their spirit is restless. Usually, for those who die unnatural deaths, their spirit harbors hatred and vengeance. Tristan. As Iâ€™ve said before. They want two of your best friends dead. And they also want you, or Tristan. But Tristan has done nothing wrong. Everything we do has an effect on others. Sometimes we end up hurting those we never meant to hurt. And we always hurt those we want to hurt even worse. The reason why they want Tristan... ...remains unclear. But itâ€™s very clear why they want you. They feel youâ€™ve taken away everything they have. So what do I do now? Take good care of yourselves. Because theyâ€™ll follow you wherever you go. You two should stay together. Because I see here that you have what Tristan needs. And it will help you. Thereâ€™s also this one thing. I see it here, but I canâ€™t make sense of it yet. I see their favorite items. Demons like that. Their existence in this world is closely tied to their favorite items. Something has to be played. Called upon, burned until thereâ€™s nothing left and destroyed. But only when the demon is right in front of you. Otherwise, it will have no effect. And you canâ€™t let one of you stop breathing. Or the dead will take the place of the living. Sabrina? Hi. Hi. Whatâ€™s up? Thereâ€™s something I have to tell you. It has something to do with Sofia. Jules, I donâ€™t want to talk about this, anymore. Didnâ€™t we agree not to bring it up ever again? We have our own lives now. Yes, I know. Since Sofia died, the three of us have stopped talking. But I have to tell you something important. Jules, please. I got a reading from a Tarot card reader. She said someone who died in the past will return and get even. With me, you and Vania. I donâ€™t know. But strange things have been happening to me. Supernatural things. I donâ€™t want anything bad to happen to either of you. Sabrina? Julie called you? She told me supernatural things are happening to her. And a Tarot card reader told her something awful will happen to her. Someone, whoâ€™s already dead, will return from the past and demand for justice. She said that? And you believed her? No matter what, weâ€™ve done some terrible things to Sofia. Sabrina, Iâ€™ve moved on with my life. Iâ€™ve buried the past. So if you see Julie, or if she tries to call you, tell her not to contact me ever again. Thanks. I just received the news. Vania is dead. They said her body didnâ€™t look right. I donâ€™t know if what you told me is true. But Vania... Vania, Jules. Sabrina. Letâ€™s go for an early practice. Coach? Coach? Coach? Open the door. Please, help me! Please, open the door! Please, help me! Swimming athlete, Sabrina, found dead under mysterious circumstances. Jules? Jules? Hey, whatâ€™s going on with you? Do you remember what the Tarot card reader said? Someone will come and disturb our lives. Theyâ€™re coming to kill one of us. She was right, Tristan. Itâ€™s Sofia. I donâ€™t know what attacked me. But itâ€™s happened more than once. Iâ€™ve also been dreaming about her several times. And I get these bruises. The same bruises I get in my sleep. When she attacks me in my dream. Perhaps all these years I hadnâ€™t been a good sister to Sofia. I didnâ€™t give her enough attention. You canâ€™t blame yourself all the time, honey. But I was the reason she killed herself, Tristan. Sheâ€™s angry. Sheâ€™s vengeful. She hates me. Sofia is dead. But sheâ€™s still with us. How would you know that? Vania and Sabrina They had also hurt Sofia. They died, Tristan. Mom, I wonâ€™t be coming home tonight. Iâ€™m staying with Julie. Yes, sheâ€™s feeling better now. Mom, could I ask you something? Do you know where my Tarot cards are? I was just asking. No. Donâ€™t you worry. No, I havenâ€™t used them in a long time. I was just asking. All right, then. Okay, bye. Jules. Jules. Jules. Jules. Jules. Jules. Jules. Jules. Jules. Ouch. Dear Diary The world isnâ€™t fair. It isnâ€™t fair to me. Iâ€™m not beautiful. Nobody wants me around. I donâ€™t have anything that I can be proud of. People always insult me and treat me badly. But there was something different about that day. Somebody looked at me a different way. It was him. He said the scar on my face is unique and that no one will ever be able to match its unique quality. He made me feel special. He made me feel loved. He was my boyfriend. Tristan. But nothing turned out as I had expected. He only wanted me because of Julie. It was Julie that he really loved, but she had moved away. In his heart and mind, there was only Julie, the person he admired most. Youâ€™re staying with me just because I look like Julie? Youâ€™re going out with me because I look like Julie? I donâ€™t need your pity. I feel betrayed. I really feel useless. Perhaps itâ€™s true. Death is easier. I donâ€™t belong in this world. What are you doing here? Why didnâ€™t you ever tell me you had gone out with Sofia? You dated her because she looked like me? It wasnâ€™t like that. Then what was it like? Why have you been hiding your relationship with her from me? I had never dated Sofia. It was my first day at school. And I saw you. It was love at first sight. I had never felt that way before. I wanted to get to know you right away, but... Sorry. Could you please give this to Julie? Julie? Sheâ€™s moved to another school. She moved to Bogor. Really? Okay. Bye. Okay. Bye. You moved the day after I saw you. And then I saw... ...her. Whom I had mistaken for you, at first. I was close to her. I was friends with her, but thatâ€™s it. Nothing more. She assumed there was more to it than that. She had misinterpreted our friendship. I had never... I had never used her to get to you. You know I moved to Bogor just to find you. And after we started dating... And after we started dating it was hard for me to tell you about my relationship with Sofia. I didnâ€™t want that fact to jeopardize what we had. Until this day, I never knew how she felt about me. Or that it had led her to commit suicide. We will never know why she did it. Was it me? Was it somebody else? Or maybe it was... Itâ€™s all because of me. No, you didnâ€™t cause this. And you didnâ€™t cause this, either. You did nothing wrong. This is exactly why I didnâ€™t want to come back here. I donâ€™t want to be reminded of Sofiaâ€™s death. I donâ€™t want to be reminded of how much she hated me. But she had always been full of hatred. She chose to commit suicide. It was all her. But she harbors revenge toward us. She really hates us. And sheâ€™s going to kill one of us, so the other will suffer. My wedding gown. Look out! Letâ€™s run. Come on. Letâ€™s run. Letâ€™s go see the Tarot card reader. Maybe she can help us. Wasnâ€™t it here the other day? Come here, honey. Sir. Whereâ€™s the Tarot card reader stall go? Itâ€™s not here, anymore. She moved. Do you know where she moved to? Now she does online readings. Thank you, Sir. What do we do now? If thereâ€™s no one out there who can help us. Weâ€™ll deal with it ourselves. Letâ€™s go. What are we doing at your house? Tristan. What are you looking for Looking for my Tarot cards. Where could they be? Tarot cards? I can read them. Iâ€™ve had the ability since I was little. My grandfather was a Tarot card reader. But Iâ€™ve stopped reading them. Five years ago, I prophesied that my brother would get into a motorcycle accident. It happened right the next day and he died. Since then I didnâ€™t want to have anything to do with Tarot cards. When Madame Herlina read your cards, I didnâ€™t want to believe her. But I donâ€™t know how all of this happened to us. You have a talent. A talent you want to hide from everyone, including yourself. We have to find those Tarot cards. Tristan. Mom, do you know where my Tarot cards are? I threw them away. I thought you didnâ€™t want to have anything to do with them, anymore. Why donâ€™t we just get new ones? Itâ€™s not that easy, honey. Once we use one deck of Tarot cards, we have to use it forever. Besides, my grandfather left me those. Mom, Iâ€™m talking about the whole deck of cards and the book. The cards and the book make up the entire set. You should stay together. Because I see here that you have what Tristan needs. It will help you. Does the book have a black cover? The writing is in golden letters? Yes, how did you know? I have it at my shop. Straight. You have to look deep inside yourself to deal with all this. Come on, try your strength. I donâ€™t know. The Hanged Man means one of us has to be sacrificed. Thereâ€™s a time when we will have to decide who between us will have to ... ...sacrifice. The hermit. Something weâ€™ve never known about, which we could solve right here. There will be an enlightenment from within ourselves. It all comes back to us. All of this points to you. The tenth card. After all has been resolved there will be a change. The star. Something bright. It could mean new hope, or it could mean somethingâ€™s broken. Failed. Demanding revenge. Already dead. But is still around us. Jules, we have to take Sofia back to her realm. But how? It has to come from you. Think about it. Anything about Sofia. I see their favorite items. Demons are like that. Their existence in this world is closely tied to their favorite items. Something has to be played. Called upon, burned until thereâ€™s nothing left and destroyed. But only when the demon is right in front of you. Otherwise, it will have no effect. The Tarot card reader also said something about Sofiaâ€™s favorite things. The music box and the red ribbon. We have to play the music box and we have to call upon her. We have to burn the red ribbon until thereâ€™s nothing left. Then we have to destroy the music box. Sofia. Sofia. Sofia. Burn it, Jules. Jules. Jules. Burn it. Quickly. Hereâ€™s the lighter. Burn it, Jules. Burn it now, honey. Honey, please. Burn it. I will die for you, as long as youâ€™re happy. Burn it now. Burn it! Jules. Jules. Jules. Jules. Jules. Jules. Jules. Jules. Jules. You may kiss the bride. Come here. What were you talking about? Over there. We were talking about the moment he proposed to you. How romantic. It was okay. Sheâ€™s just being shy. Come on, tell them. Theyâ€™d like to know the story. Thatâ€™s true. Everyoneâ€™s so curious to hear about it. Come on. It was pretty common. Like any other proposal story. No, it wasnâ€™t common, at all. Come on, honey. Tell them. Okay, it went like this. Jules, will you marry me? That was it. It wasnâ€™t like that. Thereâ€™s got to be more than that. Right? Way before I said that. What did I say to you? Before that? He said, â€˜Jules, weâ€™ve been together for so long. Iâ€™d like to build a future with you.â€™ â€˜I want to be with you, always. Will you marry me?â€™ So then I accepted the ring. Right, honey? Itâ€™s the most beautiful, most wonderful song Iâ€™ve ever heard. Come here. Iâ€™ll teach you how to play it. I still canâ€™t believe weâ€™re married. Me, either. Weâ€™re finally able to spend the rest of our lives together. But still, how could you forget about the moment I proposed to you? Didnâ€™t I tell you how I would always stay by your side every day and every second? And that youâ€™ll be my partner for life. Well, I havenâ€™t really forgotten it. I was just nervous because you put me on the spot. So what? Are you mad at me? Fine. If youâ€™re mad at me, then youâ€™re not allowed to sleep next to me tonight. No way. I love you. I love you more. Arenâ€™t you going to shower first? No, I donâ€™t want to get sick from showering at night. Letâ€™s sleep. Hello? Tristan? Hey, Mom. I feel that Julieâ€™s been acting strange. I mean, sometimes I would talk to her and... ...itâ€™s hard to connect with her. Thatâ€™s normal. Usually people become more of themselves after theyâ€™re married. Itâ€™s okay. Your father and I experienced that, as well. Donâ€™t read too much into it. Tell Julie I said hi. What now? I feel that maybe thereâ€™s something out there I can do rather than work in the office. I donâ€™t know. Something useful for me and for other people. But I donâ€™t know what it is, yet. All right, Iâ€™ll think about it. Okay, bye. Hi, honey. When did you get in? I didnâ€™t know you could play the violin. You could never play the violin. I learned how to play for you. So where did you go today, honey? I just bought some photo frames for our photos. Honey, dinnerâ€™s ready. Letâ€™s go eat. Letâ€™s go. Jules. Jules. Where did you put our photos from when we were still dating? Iâ€™ll look it up for you, honey. No, Iâ€™ll do it. Where did you put them? In the box or in the cabinet? Okay, honey. Iâ€™ll find them for you. Honey, the trash bin is full. Could you please take it out? Honey. I cooked you something special. Letâ€™s eat. Come on, taste it. Did you really just eat meat? Itâ€™s my favorite. You should try it. It tastes so good. Since when did you start eating meat again? A long time now. So do you like it? What do you think? Honey. What are you doing here? Are you looking for your Tarot cards? Honey, why are you even looking for those things? Weâ€™re happy now. Weâ€™re together. So you donâ€™t need those things, anymore. I was just curious. Okay, now letâ€™s get to bed. Tarotist Bogor Theme Park Understanding Tarot Tarotist Bogor Theme Park About me Hello? Yes, good evening. Sorry for bothering you at such a late hour. Is this Madame Herlina? A Tarot card reader at Bogor Theme Park? Thatâ€™s me. Itâ€™s me, Tristan. You once gave me and my girlfriend a card reading. Do you remember? Yes, I remember. How are you? Weâ€™re fine. Julie and I are married now. Congratulations. Iâ€™m relieved to hear that. It means my reading last night was wrong. What do you mean? I saw you in my cards last night. But you werenâ€™t married to Julie. Iâ€™m glad to hear everything is all right between you two. Can you give me a reading now? Please give me a closer reading. I want to know if the person I married really was Julie. Because I donâ€™t think itâ€™s Julie. I was going to do my own reading, but I donâ€™t have the cards. Where are you now? Could I come to you and choose my cards? Thereâ€™s no need for you to do that. Weâ€™re both Tarot card readers. I can do a reading for you even though youâ€™re not physically here. The person who came back from the past is still here. And thereâ€™s the same card I saw last night. Sheâ€™s not Julie. Did Julie ever stop breathing? Youâ€™ve done everything. Including destroying the demonâ€™s most favorite items. But all of that is useless if one of you were to stop breathing. Because then the dead will take the place of the living. An exchange. The dead takes over the body of the living. Now Julieâ€™s soul is at a crossroad, not knowing where to go. While the demon who took her body is with you now. Julie will be able to return under one condition. Only when the other woman stops breathing. Exactly as it had happened to Julie. The dead will come to life. And because youâ€™ve burned and destroyed her favorite items. The next time thereâ€™s an exchange of souls, sheâ€™ll be gone forever. And she wonâ€™t be able to take over anyone elseâ€™s body. But are you really sure about this? I mean... If you really want to make sure sheâ€™s your wife... Look at her feet. If they arenâ€™t firmly planted on the ground, then it isnâ€™t Julie. Thatâ€™s the demon. Honey. Iâ€™ll call you back. Yes? Who did you just call? I just got off the phone with my friend. Honey, Iâ€™m going to make some noodles. You want some? Okay. Okay, Iâ€™ll go make them now. Honey. What are you looking at from there? Just wait at the dining table. Why donâ€™t you go and get the plates ready? Okay. Whatâ€™s wrong, honey? My mind is all over the place. Letâ€™s just forget it. Honey, are you awake? Here, let me fix you. So your head heals faster. As your wife, all I want is to take good care of you. Youâ€™re not my wife. What do you mean Iâ€™m not your wife? Weâ€™re married. Look. And Iâ€™m head over heels for you. I feel nothing for you. All right. Enough. I donâ€™t want to fight. I just want to fix your head. We love each other, donâ€™t we? And you always tell me how much you love me every day. I say that to Julie, not you. But, honey, I am Julie. Youâ€™re not Julie, youâ€™re Sofia! But Iâ€™m better than Julie. And I love you better than she does. Iâ€™m more talented than Julie. Though I admit I do look like her. You just have to get used to it. Okay, honey? Honey. Honey, donâ€™t be like that. Let me get you fresh bandages. Help. Julie will be able to return under one condition. Only when the other woman stops breathing. Exactly as it had happened to Julie. The dead will come to life. Jules. Jules, wake up. Come on, wake up. Jules. Help. Help. Wake up, Jules. Jules, please. Come on, Jules. Wake up. Help. Jules? Jules? Jules? What are you doing? You look so serious. Iâ€™m looking at the profile of someone whoâ€™s going to help you design the place where youâ€™ll do your readings. He seems qualified. Why donâ€™t we sell Tarot cards here at the bookstore? So people can learn how to read their own cards. Thatâ€™s fine. But you donâ€™t have to look so serious about it. Iâ€™m being very serious. Hello, Maâ€™am. Hi. Itâ€™s so good to see you guys. Back together again. How did you end up here? I saw the advertising. It says thereâ€™s a great Tarot card reader here. So here I am. Not nearly as good as you are. Please, sit down. Youâ€™re better than me. I will teach you how to get more insights from Tarot cards. How about giving us a reading right now? All right. A new beginning. Once again. Unlike the previous reading.. Nothing will stand in your way. Thereâ€™s only fortune. Brilliant dreams that you can always reach. The past is now buried. And itâ€™s time to turn the page. Your marriage will last a long time. Without any problems you canâ€™t solve. You can get through anything together. Be optimistic. Youâ€™re loved by everyone around you. A husband who can lead his wife. A wife who is always there for her husband. Your love is strong. The foundation of a beautiful future. A joyful life. Forever. Howâ€™s your reading? How far into it are you? Iâ€™ll be finished shortly. I thought you said you were going to help your friend. Whose wife has been missing this past year. So how is he doing now? Heâ€™s found her. Really? I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m married to a Tarot card reader. Who still needs to learn a lot. And whoâ€™s very talented. Thatâ€™s why you have to keep praying for me. Pray that I finish this book soon. So I can one day become a professional Tarot card reader. And Iâ€™ll pray so that you wonâ€™t pout when I pay attention to my Tarot cards. But this is what you choose to do. You told me how youâ€™ve always wanted to be the kind of person who helps other people. And you never really liked it working in an office. And as it turned out ... you have a talent in reading Tarot cards. That means I will never pout. You once told me that peopleâ€™s future can change. That it depends on how we live. Yes. Why? Youâ€™re still thinking about Madame Herlinaâ€™s reading? Are you afraid we might not be happy in the future? Or that maybe our lives wouldnâ€™t be as beautiful in the future?
