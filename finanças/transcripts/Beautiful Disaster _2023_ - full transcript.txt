- May I have your attention, please? Five-11-54 from Vegas to Sacramento is now departing. - Dad, sorry I ran off. I need a fresh start. - I'm done bailing you out. - Look your opponent in the eyes even when you're shuffling. - I'm not gonna play poker anymore. I've always wanted to go to college and I've just been accepted second semester. I wanna live a normal life with kids my age. I'll call you when I'm ready to talk. Abby. - Hey, pal! - Hi. - I missed you. - I missed you so much. - Still, I can't believe you're finally here. You, um, I'm sorry. What are you wearing? - It's the new me. - You good? - Yeah. - Yeah. Do you wanna see our dorm? - Yes. - Because we're roommates. - Yeah. - Yes, it's so awesome. Oh, my God. It is so good to see you. I feel like it's been like months. Yeah, the neighbors are pretty decent. Though, the guy across the hall vapes that horrendous blueberry shit 24/7 and also plays Nickelback nonstop. - Crazy. - Yeah. Also, the showers suck. - I'm sure the showers don't suck. So you really spruced up the place. - Yeah. You know, I just wanted to wait for you to get here. - What's his name? - Shepley. And he is so hot. - Hm. He doesn't have any face piercings. - Yeah, well, sometimes you just wake up one day and like pistachios. He's really excited to meet you though and he is taking us out tonight. - Oh no, Mer, I'm so tired. - No. - I just got here, it was a long bus ride. I just wanna stay here and study. - It'll be so chill. Catholic school will let you off for one night. Come on. - No, I'm not going. - Yes, we're going. Take off the chastity belt and let's go. - No, I don't wanna go. I have to study, Mer, Mer! So where are we going? - Oh, it's a surprise. - I think there's a guy, never mind. - Oh, hey, oh, by the way, we don't talk about the circle. It's a secret. - What's a secret? - Exactly. - Welcome to the bloodbath! Whoo! If you're looking for Economics 101, you are in the wrong fucking place, but if you seek the circle, this is Mecca. My name is Adam. I make the rules and I call the fight. Tonight, we have a new challenger, Eastern star varsity wrestler Marek Young. All right, all right. Now, reigning champ needs no introduction, but because he scares the shit out of me, I'm gonna give him one. So shake in your boots, boys, and drop your panties, ladies. I give you Travis "Mad Dog" Maddox! - Whoo! - Whoo! - You know, this isn't for me. I'm gonna go back to the dorm and study. Hello. - May I? - Uh-huh. - Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis. - You ready? You ready? Fight! Yeah! - Oh, okay. - Oh, shit! - Come on, Travis! - Run it, sweet money. - Um, excuse me. Are you new here? - Yeah, I. - Whoa! - Oh, shit! Get up, Travis, come on! - Get up! - Come on, get up! - Get up! - Yeah! - Two-one. - Come on, Travis. - Winner! - Travis! Travis! - You okay? - Uh-huh. - Hey, you standing here. I don't know if that's good for me. I usually don't get distracted like that. Sorry about your sweater, pigeon. Whoa-ha. Grr. - Travis, you are my cash cow, baby. - I can't take you anywhere. - What's up, pigeon? - I fucking hate you! - Relax! - You didn't come home last night. You're a liar. - Calm down. - You're a liar. - Wow. - What are you doing? - Listen, Abby, tuition payments need to be issued through a bank account or a credit card. There is accountability to be considered, not to mention the taxes. - I'm in the process of setting one up. - Can't your parents help you out? - It's complicated. My mom, I haven't spoken to in years, and my dad is not the best guy. - I'll allow it for this semester, but sort yourself out a bank account because this will not be happening again. - Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. So I talked to the bursar this morning and she ended up taking the cash. I mean, at least I'm covered for the semester. - Oh, what happens when the money runs out? - I don't know. I'll find a job or I'll get a scholarship. I'll figure something out. Incoming. - Hey, pumpkin. I got you a coffee here. - Thank you. - Aw. - That's for you. - Thanks. - How was last night? Did you have fun? - Yeah, it was memorable. So what was the deal with the one guy, the guy that was covered in tattoos? - Oh, that's his cousin. He's a sophomore. - Oh, that guy goes to college? - Mm-hm. - Wow, that is surprising. - What's surprising? - That you go to college. - Why can't I go to college? - I didn't say it, bro, she said it. - What? No, I didn't say that. - Sorry, have we met? - Oh, you don't remember, Travis? You, you ruined her sweater. - I ruin a lot of sweaters. - I'm pretty sure they retired bad double entendres. - Pigeon. - Abby. My name is Abby. - Travis. Travis Maddox. - Does that move really work? - No, not a single time, but it is sincere. - You're not my type. - I'm everybody's type. See, I got you. I got a smile out of you. - No, no, that was not a smile. That was actually a condescending chuckle. - Yeah. Hey, I'm gonna come over, all right? See you later, pigeon. - Abby, my name is Abby. - Well, it's pigeon now. - Can you believe that guy? - And that is what brings us to the discovery of game theory. Now, game theory is a term that was pioneered in the 1950s by mathematician John Nash. The term game is defined as any interaction where each person's payoff is affected by the decisions. - Mm. Wow. So hot. - That one's my favorite. It's too late to close it now. - Has anyone ever told you that it's not very polite. - Young lady? What is your name? - Abby. - Ms. Abby, would you care to educate us as to why Nash's equilibrium is irrelevant to game theory? - Irrelevant? I can't. - Well, then perhaps you should focus a little more on. - Well, but that's because it is relevant. If equilibrium is achieved, that means that both players can't increase payoff by changing decisions unilaterally. It can also be known as no regrets in the sense that once a player does make a decision, they'll have no regrets thinking about the consequences. - Have you been reading ahead? - A bit. - As I was saying. - Wow, pigeon, that was so hot. You got brains. - Why are you here? - Why are you sending me a mixed signal? - There's nothing mixed about my signals. - I just caught you Insta stalking me. - I was not Insta stalking. Look, I'm going to save you a lot of wasted time. You can stop the antics, okay? I'm not sleeping with you. - I'm not trying to sleep with you or bag you. I'm just trying to take you to dinner. - Bag me? What am I, groceries? Have you not read a newspaper in the last four years? Men don't talk like that anymore. - Which men? - The evolved men of planet Earth. The ones who are actually in touch with their feelings. I don't like you. Leave me alone. You're not going to let this go, aren't you? - I'll pick you up at eight. - But wait, you don't have my number. - Interest to play his part. - You dress up for me? - No, I didn't have to because this is not a date. - Well, I hope you're hungry. - No, no, no. I don't need this because I'm not getting on that thing. - Yeah, you are. - Do you know the statistics of motorcycles in accidents? No, I'm not putting on that thing. - Yeah, you are. I can do this all night. - Fine. - Thanks, Miguel. - Yep. - You're really not gonna let me buy you dinner? - No, this isn't a date. - Yes, I'm aware. You've said that twice now. - Oh, you noticed. - Mm-hm. That and your outfit, which screams "I detest Travis." - I don't detest you. I just don't like being a foregone conclusion for one of the many, many, many notches on your bedpost. - Oh, you're smart. I like that. - Something you're probably not used to in a woman. - Oh, I'm striking out. I surrender. We can at least be friends. - Friends, but with no benefits. - We're not sleeping together. I won't even think about the benefits unless you want me to. - No, that can't happen so that we can stay friends. - Friends. Friends. I've been coming to this place for years. My family home is only three miles that way. - Aw. You couldn't move farther away from your mommy? - No, that's not it. - Her grilled cheese was just that good? - Well, she's dead. - Shut up. Are you serious? I'm such an asshole, I'm so sorry. I feel horrible. - It's okay, it's okay. I was only three. - Okay, I'm not that sorry. Get your hand off me. How's your dad? - He's still alive, so you can make fun of him. He's a good man. He raised five boys all on his own. - Five Maddox brothers? - Yeah. Thomas, Taylor, Tyler, Trent, and Travis. If you wanna get good at fighting, having four older brothers beat your ass daily is a good place to start. - Why do it? - College ain't cheap. Fighting is a good way to make money. - Just seems unnecessarily risky. - Why? You worried about me? - Not even in the slightest. - What's your story? - Just your average girl from your ordinary town. - Oh, mom and dad? - One of each. - Wow, you're a wealth of information. - Well, I can't give away all the goods in one night. - Most do. I actually enjoy it. Are you seriously leaving? - Dinner's over. - We just got started. - Good night, Travis. - Hey, purple sweater. Little help? - Yeah. - Ooh! - Oh, no! - Oh, my god. - Police. - He's, he's fine. Okay, it's okay. He's okay. - I'm fine. - Okay, are you okay? - Oh, I'm fine. - Okay, I'm so sorry. - Oh, God. Oh! - You're so cute and you're crying, I swear. - I'm not, I'm not crying. It's, uh, it's the wind. How long have you been captain of the Frisbee club? - Oh, no, no, no, I'm not captain of the Frisbee club. - Oh, it was, uh, it was a joke. It was a joke, I'll be okay. - Oh, hi. - Hi. - Hi, I'm Abby. - I'm gonna go. I'm, I'm gonna wobble. - You should put some ice on your balls. - You should put some ice on my balls. - Okay. - Oh, yeah, I'm gonna go. - It was really nice to meet you, Parker. Oh! - Thanks, man. - Fuck you! - Be careful! Ow! Ow. Could someone turn the water back on? So the RA said we're gonna be without water for the next 24 hours, so it's just for the night. Are you sure Shepley is cool with this? - Hey, Abby's staying over. - Just stay out of Travis's room, all right? - What? You didn't tell me that Travis lives here. - No, of course I did. No, remember, I told you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - I'm not staying here. - Abby, Abby! - No, I'm leaving. - No, I promise you will never see him. He's never even here. You won't see him, I promise. You have to stay, It'll be so fun. Hey, tell her that Travis will be okay. - Oh, he won't care, he likes you. - He doesn't know me. - He likes you. We're gonna have a sleepover. So much fun, we'll make s'mores. Hey, let's go. - Bye. - Bye. - Abby, babe, it's Dad. Where'd you go? Could you return the call or at least text me back? - Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. - Excuse me. - Sure. - Okay, merci. - Jesus. - Enjoy the show? - You scared the crap out of me. - You know that's not a very attractive idiom once you stop and think about it. - Because in your sexist universe, women don't actually defecate? - Wow, that's a perfect word for someone like you. Did you know that the saying used to be "bejesus out of me?" - Your friend gave this to me to give to you. What? The woman that you just had sex with gives you her number and you just throw it away? - That's not her leaving her number. That's her marking her territory. - Well, then maybe you shouldn't have sex with her. - I don't remember promising her a thing. - Wow. You embody everything that is wrong with your gender. She's an adult. I'm an adult. It was consensual. Look at this. - Consent date. - Can never be too careful nowadays. - How many women do you have contracts with? - No idea, I'm a quality guy over quantity. - I'm gonna throw up. - Well, my bedroom is down the hall and the bed is all yours for when you wanna crash. - I'm not gonna sleep in your bed. - Why? No one but me sleeps in my bed. My bed is sacred ground. - Well, then why would I be allowed in your bed? - Are you planning on having sex with me tonight? - No. - Then it's settled. Wow, make yourself at home. - Sorry, I just have a big 10 a.m. Bio test to cram for, but I can move back to the kitchen. - No, you're fine, stay where you're at. Don't be silly. - Thank you. - Do you want me to make you some tea or something? - No, but, uh, my highlighter just died. Can I borrow one? - Oh, yeah, check the top drawer. Wait, um, no. - Wow. That's a lot. - Is practicing safe sex a crime? - What's this? - It's not a highlighter, I'll tell you that. Um. - It's a yo-yo? - No, definitely not. It's awkward. I'm gonna go shower. - What are you doing? Bad kitty. Mouse. Mouse. Abby. Pigeon. - Really cute. How much? - Um. It's not what do you think it is. Abby, you're. - Wait, what are you doing? - Abby! - Abby! - What the heck? - What is wrong with you? - I didn't do anything. You touched me. - Oh, says the man with the raging hard-on. You should be locked up. - You're the sleepy cock toucher. I didn't put your hand there. And if you bothered to read a biology textbook, you'd find out that it's called parasympathetic nerve response and you'd know that if you knew anything about biology or men. - Oh, shit, Bio! What time is it? - 9:42. - Oh, my God. - What are you wearing? - We were playing. - We were playing. - Let me give you a ride. - No, this is just a madhouse. A nurse? - Yeah, no, I. - Sorry, excuse me. Sorry. Oh, my God! I slipped. But I still aced my Bio test. - Well, I'm glad you're not drawing attention to yourself. - Hilarious. - Okay, I have to run to class, but I want a full play-by-play of what happened last night. - Nothing happened last night. - Yeah? - I do not like him. - Yeah, and that's why you're giving him a good morning handy. Is Mick still bothering you? - Yeah. - You got to cut him out of your life. - He is out of my life. - He is not out of your life because he is still texting you. I-I gotta go to class. - What? - Hey. Parker, we meet again. - Abby, are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, it's a long story. Hey, um, how are your, your balls? - Not good. - Oh, my God. - That's okay. I think they said I had a 20% chance of a normal sex life. - Are you messing with me? - Not funny? - No, it was, it was hilarious. Well, um, okay, bye. - Do you have dinner plans tonight? - Me? - Yes. - No, I-I-I-I do not have dinner plans. - I know a great Italian spot. - Um, um. - Is that a, is that? - No, that is a yes. Yes, I would love that very much. Pick me up at seven, I live at Tucker dormitory. - Sure, I'll pick you up then. - Okay. Bye. I see you! Oh, Parker. Really? Thank you. Thank you, Parker. Oh, no way, Travis Maddox. You can keep knocking but I am not gonna answer that door. No way. I'll see you soon, Parker. - Thanks again, Sonny. - Anytime, doctor. - Doctor Hayes. - He's jumping the gun, you know. I just started, that's all. - Wow, fancy-fancy. - Yeah. Wow. - Are you on call? - No, I-I just got a heads-up about a show tonight. - Oh, oh, I can get my own ride home. - No, no, no, we-we should both go. Unless you've got work or sick of seeing me. - No. No, I would love to go. - This is-this is gonna be fun. - You know, I've always wanted to see Titus Andronicus. It's considered to be Shakespeare's most violent play. - You don't mind violence? - No, I was something of a tomboy growing up. - Well, then you're in for a treat. - Ooh, I guess it's starting. he's a state champ. He's gonna come out swinging. He's not gonna be wasting any sort of time. Okay, what are you doing? - Abby hasn't texted me back today. - Oh, my God. Would you forget about Abby? Have you, have you seen this guy? He's got a white robe and a belt that's huge, okay? I mean, you're acting like the kissing booth over here. You need to focus. - I am focused. - That's the Travis we need. Come on. - I just don't know why she hasn't texted me back. I'm gonna go outside and see if I can get better cell reception. - We're dead. - Oh, wow, modern interpretation. I love Shakespeare. - All right, all right. Next up, we have the main event: Freddy Heflin versus Travis "Mad Dog" Maddox! - This is gonna be great. Travis is a real animal. Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, it's just a little hot in here. I'm gonna go find a bathroom. - What the fuck, Abby? You don't respond to any of my texts, and now you're here dressed like that with your titties hanging out. - They are not hanging out. This is a tasteful amount of cleavage. - Yeah? Well, they're distracting me. - Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot. It's all about you, you egomaniac. - I must break you. - Go for it. - That's who you're fighting? - Yes. - That guy could kill you. - Is this your weird little way of admitting you like me? - I don't like you. But I do worry about you. I worry about the planet. They're two very different things. - Okay, well, if it puts your mind at ease, he's not even gonna hit me. - Hilarious. - Are you doubting me? - Yeah. - Care to make it interesting? - Make it interesting? Like a bet? - Yeah. - I don't bet. - Come on, Travis, they need you. - Yeah, just a minute. How's this? If he manages to lay a hand on me, I'll go without sex for a week. - Ooh. - A month. Three months. - Three months? That's impossible for someone like you. - Okay, and if I win, you have to stay with me for a month. - You're on. But get it through your head, I am never having sex with you. - I don't wanna have sex with you, pidge. I wanna be around you. You're good for me. You are handsome. - You're dead. - Hah. You are handsome as hell. No wonder you're the champ. Champ of my heart. - Come on, hit him! - You ever hiked Brokeback Mountain? Do you wanna? - I'll be gentle, you know. - How are you gonna kill me, big boy? Giddy up. kill you! - What are you doing? - Shut up. - Hit him! Just once! - Oh-oh, baby fell down. Get back in your crib, little baby. Oh-ho-ho. Now,. So I'm saving the upper left sock throw for you. - Fuck you, bitch. - You cover those up. - You bitch. - Excuse me. - Just once, hit him! - Here we go! - Ladies and gentlemen, Travis Maddox! - Pack your bags, pigeon. You're coming home with me. - How did this happen? - Hey, I got you a water. What's going on? I just need to process this. - I know. - We go out for a great dinner. Get on really well. I take you to a show. I leave you for five minutes. And during that time, you've decided to move in with Travis Maddox. - I lost a bet. - Right. - We're just friends. I mean, we're not even friends. We're nothing. I had a really nice time with you tonight and I would love to do it again. Do you think I can, I can get a good-night kiss? Oh, God! No! - Travis! - Time to go. - Yeah, you need to, you need to leave the car. - He is not going to do anything. See? - No, he's gonna hurt me. - He's not gonna hurt you. - No, he's gonna hurt me. - Open the door. - Get out of the car. - No. - Please get out the car! - You are strong, it's okay. - No, he is a maniac. He is gonna hurt me, leave the car! - He's not going to hurt. - Leave the car now! - Oh, my God. - Get out the fucking car! - Open the door! - You're being insane. Okay, okay. - Leave the car. Go, go, leave the car! - Okay, I'm leaving. Okay, okay. - Go, please. Go now. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. Oh, Jesus. Yeah, on it, yeah. - I cannot believe this is happening. - Well, for the record, I didn't think you'd really settle up. - Well, I made a bet, I lost. You're only as good as your word. I made it through one night without any funny business. I think I can make it through 30 more. What? - Well, you did give me a. - I did not give you a handy. I have no interest in touching your dick ever again. - Oh, oh. - Okay, got it? - Okay, okay. You're getting a little aggro. - Oh, what? Do women with emotions make you scared? - Uh-uh. - You wait till I'm on my period, okay? I might stab you. - Sorry, I thought this would be a fun idea. - Well, it wasn't. - How about we just go to sleep? - Yeah, you think? Give me this, I want that. And don't touch me! Don't cross this line, okay? Wall of China. - I just cleaned in here. You live like animals. You guys are filthy. - Abby, come on. - Get out of the way. - Come on, get out of the way. - Abby, get out of the way! - Hey! - No, no, no, no! - Come on, girls. - Do you mind? - Shut up. - Oh. - Hey, Shep, I'm gonna hit the store. Do you want? - Bring it up, yeah. Yeah. - I'm trying, I'm trying! - Up, up, up, up. Okay, good job, go home. Are you gonna quit? Go on then! - No, I'm trying! I'm trying! Yup. - One. - Two. You know, this is really easy. You made this so hard. Oh. No, I can do it. I don't know. Taking me home to meet the family. - Get over yourself. It's just Sunday dinner. - What have you been doing for the past hour? - Trying to find the fucking. Where is it? How is that possible? - That's how it was when I found it. - Oh, you're fucking worthless. Just hand me a seven-16th. - Hey, I'm not your bitch. - And you're a pretty little bitch. - Call me a bitch again, huh? - Bitch, bitch. - Hey, dipshits. We got company. - Oh, oh, oh, oh, my. Baby bro is bringing home a girl. - Guys, this is Abby. Abby, these are the moron twins, Tyler and Taylor. - Hi. - Fraternal, obviously. - And we're not morons. Travis is the moron. - Can you guys not act like assholes just yet? - Oh. - Brother's mouthing off in front of his woman. You're a big guy, aren't you? - Yeah, you're the big man on campus, right? - Doesn't make any sense. - Well, this makes sense. - Oh. - Taylor! - Cobra kai! - Get back, Taylor. - So immature. Oh, you're Abigail, right? - Mm-hm. - I'm, uh, Trenton. The most attractive Maddox brother. - Hey. - Has anyone ever told you you have the most. - No! No. - Ladies, not in front of my bike. Take it in the ring. - Yes, sir. - Put my tools back where you found them. - Yes, sir. - Hey, I'm Jeff. - I'm Abby. - Nice to meet you. - You too. - Come on inside. - Thanks. - So, uh, Abby, have you ever experienced the deliciousness of fried chicken from Kentucky? - Moron, not every chicken is from Kentucky. - Yeah, it is. That's why they call it Kentucky Fried Chicken. - What's going on here? Are you serious? You're back. - What's up, boys? - Yo. - Hey. - Dude, hey, you made it. - What's going on? - Hey, sorry, uh, work ran late. All right, you must be, um, is it Abby? - Yeah, and you're Thomas, right? You're the oldest. - I see Travis warned you about us, huh? - Riveting conversation, let's dig in. - Yeah. - Oh, yeah. - Grace. Travis. - Oh, Heavenly Father. Thank you for the food, for we remember the hungry. Please look after our dear mother, Diane. May she rest in peace. - Amen. - Give me. - Can we? - Okay. - Is this all drumsticks, Dad? - I want breasts, I want breasts. - I want breasts. - Guys, guys, there's a lady present. - Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. - Oh, wow. - They're being nice today. Those are some good pieces. - Really sweet, thank you, guys. - Uh, I don't wanna rain on Travis's parade, but my shift starts at 10, so let's get down to business. - 10, God. - That's like. - I'm just saying if you wanna play, let's play. - I'm gonna have to whoop your butt fast. - Oh, yeah. I-I can carry some stuff. - All right, the name of the game is Texas hold 'em, Abby, you in? - Oh, that's not for me. Drinks? - Yeah. - Beer for me and there's chips up there and there's dip and there's like you know, just whatever you can carry. - Okay. - Deal, deal, deal, deal, deal, deal. - Let's go. - Let me get the chip. - Got nothing. - Eat shit. Straight on the river and he does it again, boys. - Are you kidding me? - Abby, you've been watching a while. You wanna join? - Oh, I'm okay. - Don't worry. We take it easy on the ladies over here. - We can play Go Fish if you like. - You know, I actually don't think it's a question of you guys going easy on me. I actually think it's a question of me going easy on you guys. - Oh. - Okay, you're being serious. - Mm-hm. - Okay. - Okay. - Abby, you might not wanna do that. Taylor may look like an idiot, but he happens to be one of the best poker players in town. - Oh, in town. - In the county. - Oh, wow, the county. - He's even played on TV. - Oh, on TV. That's pretty impressive, I don't know. Let's go. - Okay. Fold, beginner's luck. - This is no beginner's luck. - Well, I never said I was a beginner. Call. - Flash. - Pair of aces. - Yes! - Yes! - Da, da, da, da, da, da, da. - Aces and eights, boys. - Don't tell me! That's a full house. - Yes, it is. - You just got hustled, bro. - Well, no, it's only hustling if I keep your money. - Oh. - Oh, no, no, no. Sweetheart, that money's yours. You won it fair and square. - Shit. - Where did you learn to play? - Home. - Home? Where was that? - Vegas. My dad taught me. - Used to be a high-stakes poker player named Abernathy. I remember hearing stories about him in Vegas. - What happened? - Uh, he had this daughter. Went with him everywhere. I think the mom walked out on him so he was raising her on his own. - Your eyes even when you're shuffling. - While she was way too young to play legally but man, she was a poker prodigy. As she got better, he got worse. So she was left bailing him out even as a kid. - Look your opponent in the eyes. - I remember this. They called her Lucky Charms. - Lucky 13. Abby, you must have heard of her, right? She must be about your age. After all, this is you in the article, isn't it? - You're Lucky 13? - We just got hustled by Lucky 13? - No fucking way. - Guys, I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to hustle you guys or anything, I swear. I'm. - Lucky 13's in this house? - Yeah. - Lucky 13 in the house! - Lucky 13 in the house. - Abby, can I get a photo with you? - No, guys, it wasn't really. - Guys, guys, hey. You're acting like a bunch of fangirls. - Get out of my way. - You're a fangirl. - She beat me. You're a fangirl, move! Shut up! Get your ugly ass face out of the way! - You act like you're so fucking innocent. - Fuck you! - How could he do that to Tessa? - Jab. Cross. Why are you so happy? - I don't know, I'm a happy fighter, okay? - No, no. If you were actually happy in the ring, it would be so easy to just slap that smirk off. - It would disarm people. - Jab, cross. This time with actual meaning to it. - Okay, okay, I get it, I'll be angry. - Well, can you go? Go now, go now! - I'm angry, okay. - Jab, cross, jab, cross. Oh. - Just like I've, I've never dated anyone like him but when I'm with him, I just, sometimes feel like he could be my forever person. I don't know, he just like makes me laugh in this way that like, I don't know, like Travis makes you laugh. - I don't know what you're talking about. - That is bullshit. - I don't know. - Bitch, you know. - Okay, yeah, look, I will admit. His physique is appealing. - His physique is appealing? - Yes, his physique is appealing. But I've learned not to court excitement for the sake of excitement. I mean, truthfully, he seems a little crazy. And we both know that the last thing I need is more crazy. - Absolutely. - I. Ugh. - I believe that's my side of the bed. - I'm moving. - Did you finish the homework? - Yeah, just about. You need any help? - Nah, I'm good. - Please tell me you're not gonna clip your toenails in bed. - So, I hear it's someone's birthday in two days. - You hear, or you eavesdropped? That was between Mer and I. - Ow! - That was a private conversation. - That hurt. - Well, it serves you right for eavesdrop. - Whoa-ho. What did I just get out of you there? What are you, half bulldog? - Well, you groped me. - I did not grope you, that was a poach. Oh, you are a snort. I didn't realize this. - Mm, I'm not ticklish. - Okay, don't. Do you really wanna play this? Okay. - Come on. - There we go. - This is just. - How do you think this was gonna end? - Get off me. I'll fight you, you know, I'll fight you. - Fight? Oh, you. Ow! You bit my cat. - Oh, relax. It was a nibble. - Yeah, well it hurt. - Oh, did it? You loved it. - I did kind of love it, yeah. - Wait! You good? - Am I good? - Mm-hm. - No. Um, I'm just confused. - Where are you going? - This is a joke. - Oh, come on, Travis. Don't you wanna talk about this? - Talk about it, why? You want to hear how I really feel about you, Abby? - No, I-I don't. - Abby, then. - Because I don't feel the same way. - You're lying. - I'm not. Travis, you're vulgar, you're a brute, you're. - Touch me. I have to pee. I'm sorry. - Wait, where you going? I'm on the verge. - I'll be right back. - Babe, I'm on. - What's going on? - Shh. - You okay? - No, no, I'm not okay. Um, Travis and I, we made out kind of aggressively. - Clarify. - And then I grabbed, he grabbed my. I put his hand on my. - Breast? - No, lower. - Oh. - America, I don't know what to do. It's like, the logic goes out of my head. If I go back in there, I'm not gonna be able to stop myself. - So you do like him. - America, I think I'm in love with him. - Hey, Abby. This is a totally normal position and I'm not flexing at all. Hey, baby girl. Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? She's okay, she's okay, she's okay. She's just nervous, but I can help you through your nervousness. Don't read her like this. It's too corny. You're not toxic, you're a cool guy. You're really cool and strong. Hi, Abby. Give me a hug. Oh, no, that's so scary. - Travis? - Yeah, no, I mean, he might have a. Guys. Oh, hold up. Where the hell have you been? - Out. - Jesus, you reek of alcohol. - I got a cat. I named him Tabby, he's a stray. And I would kill for him, and he would kill for me unlike some people I know in this house. - That's the neighbor's cat, Rumpleteazer. - All right, isn't this Tabby? - I mean, brah, it's got a collar right there. - Shit. Well. - Hey, bud. - The hell are you still doing here? - I was up all night worried about you. - That's rich. Shouldn't you be worried about your boyfriend or something? - My boyfriend? - Yeah, Mick. That's right, I saw the text on your computer. Very nice, very nice. Staying here while he's texting you "I love you, I miss you." What a joke. - Travis, Mick is my dad. And how often are you going through my text messages? - "Can I come see you?" would make sense. So it was your dad? No way. That's terrible of me. Well, I misinterpreted that. That's great news. - Is it great news? Travis, you invaded my privacy and then you turned around and ghosted me. Goodbye. - Abby, wait, wait. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I-I was jealous, I messed up. - No, Travis, you didn't mess up. If anything, you just showed me who you really are. - Abby, wait, can we talk? - Bye. - Hey. - Did anyone ever tell you that you're a very cute sleeper? - Hi, Parker. - Hi. Is Travis nearby? Do I need to be worried? - Ugh, no. - It's been a while. How-how have you been? - Pretty shitty. - Postmates? - I would love that. - So, I spent most of fifth grade with a broken leg that they had to reset twice. So I got to know the doctors pretty well, and realized that's what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. - What kind of doctor do you wanna be? - Pediatric medicine. - Right, yeah, of course, because it's you. - Anyway, that's enough about me. - What do you wanna be when you grow up? - I'm still trying to figure it out. Really good ramen. - Do you wanna get out of here? - Yes, yes, yes. I'm saying yes a lot, but yes. - It is right up here. - We're not gonna a show again, are we? - I would not make that mistake again. Right through here. - Why is it so dark in here? - Surprise! - Whoo. All right, everybody. Get some drinks. Get some shots. Happy birthday, Abby. - Thank you. - Hey, are you surprised? - Yeah. - Touchdown. And, uh, nice work, doc. - Were you in on this? - Uh, only for the last 10 minutes. Shepley put out an APB for you. - Babe, success, success. Take some shots. Told you this would work out, did I not, I said it. - You did, you really did. Yeah. - I'm gonna grab us a drink and I will take this. - Oh, thank you. - How are you, birthday pal? - Hi. Thank you. - Isn't this great? - Yeah, yeah. Who are all these people? - Mm, no idea. Travis got it in his head that this was the only way to say he was sorry and then Shepley got like really excited and, and I couldn't talk them off the ledge. - There he is. I should probably go talk to Travis. - Yeah. Bye, little bird. - You busy? - Hey, it's the almost birthday girl. Surprised? - Yeah, surprised is an understatement. You even recruited Parker. - Well, he found you. I should have known that you guys would be hanging out. - Well, I can trust him. - Cool. - Cool. Um, well, I'm gonna. - Yeah, have fun. - Yeah. - You okay? - No. I need to get fucked up. - I can make that happen. - Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot. - Whoo! - Ooh! - Oh, two. - Oh. - Shoot, oh, all right. - Damn, girl. - Whoo! - It's that kind of night. Oh. - Oh. - Slow down. - I'm so sorry. The line was interminable. - Oh. - I got, I got us merlots. - Parker, concentrating. - Uh. - Why are you so good at this? - I'll be over there on the sofa. - You played this before. You played this. - If you look at the health care system under Obamacare, we are obviously on a collision course. I know, it's bad. Oh, come on. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Abby, Abby, Abby. - You're good. He's got. - No, I don't want kids! - What do you, what do you mean you don't want kids? It's. - I don't want kids. I don't wanna. - Why? I never knew this. - I don't want any kids. - I want like five kids. - Five kids? - Yes. I want Ted Junior. - Don't, who is Ted One? - Millicent. - I'm not a baby factory. - This is, this is like whole. - And I'm not naming my kid Millicent. - This is the point of life. - I hate Millicent. - Well, I hate you. - I hate you more. - Are you okay? - No. No, it's over. I'm never giving my heart to anyone ever again. - No! No, don't say that. You just need to dance. You just need to dance your troubles away. Just do what I do. Oh, hi. - Babe, I am so sorry. I don't know why I said that out there. - I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Do you wanna go and make outside? - Yes, right now? Yeah, let's go. - Okay. - Have fun. - This has been great, I'm gonna get out of here. - No, come on, dance with me. - I'm-I'm not in the mood. - Oh, come on, loosen up. Oh, I know. I'm twerking. - Uh. - The boys like the twerking. - No, no, you're not. No, this is, uh, yeah. - This is twerking. Twerking. - Yeah, yeah, it's good. - Come on, have fun, you're not fun. Come on, loosen up, have fun. Come on. - He's in the back room. - Excuse me. - Travis? The guy you're looking for. - No, I came here with you. - Wow! Oh, you actually recoiled. - You just caught me off guard. - Be honest with yourself and see this thing through with Travis. - He's not good for me. - You keep telling yourself that. - Hello, hello. Okay, thank you. - Hey, what the fuck are you doing? You heard of alcohol poisoning? You hit double digits an hour ago. - What are you, counting? - Yeah, actually. You've had enough for tonight. - No. - Have you got anything to eat today? - Yes, soup. - Soup? - Soup. - Okay, well, that's gonna end badly for you. Stop drinking. - No. - You're beyond stubborn. - Oh, I'm so sorry I'm not one of your subservient little wenches. - Do you know how hard this was to put together? I did all this for you. - I didn't ask you to do any of this. - I-I know, that's the point. I did it because I care about you. - Well, Travis, you're too late. Tomorrow the bet's over, and you never have to see me again. - Shit. Abby, wait. - Go away! - Stand still. I, you're a mess. Why are you running? - You're a mess. - I'm faster than you. - No, no, no. - Abby! - Get off, no! - Okay, okay, okay. - You know, you are such a coward. You're such a coward. - You're not making any sense. - No, you're not. You just run away from me. Rather than ask me who Mick was. You just-you just run away and then you just throw me this really big surprise birthday party for my birthday. And you think it's all gonna be okay where I don't even know anybody. And then you just ignore me all night. And you think I'm just gonna forgive you? Because you throw me this really big surprise birthday party for my birthday where I don't know anybody. - You said that already. - Stop telling me what to do! - Okay, okay. First off, I did apologize to you and I tried to have a conversation with you too. But you ran off to the fucking library only to show up later with Parker and then proceed to get beyond fucked up. So, pidge, you're gonna have to walk away from me because I can't walk away from you. Beautiful. - When did I have noodles? I think I'm done. - Okay. - Oh, sorry. - Oh, you're all right. Well, I sure hope you're done. I'm not sure if you have anything left in there to throw up. - Hey, you wanna make out? - Not really, no. I don't. You know what the best part about this is, pigeon? - Hm. - You're not gonna remember any of this. - I'm not? - No. So when I tell you that I'm madly in love with you. - I won't remember. - But I really mean it. - Hm. Do you wanna go to International House of Pancakes and get pancakes? Yeah? You wanna go? I love pancakes. - Oh, man, what a great idea. I'm gonna get you up. - Do you wanna go? - I'm gonna stand you up. - Oh, I wanna go to pancakes. Okay, I want pancakes. - I got you a clean shirt instead, I'll be back. - Thank you, that's very nice. - Um. - I'm a monster. - Okay, let me help you. - I'm stuck out here. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Okay, there we go, put this on. - Turn around. I'm decent. Just kidding. Oh, my God. - I got you. - Put your shirt on. - I got you. - Put it on. - I'm putting it on. - Okay. - Okay, it's on. - Oh, my God. Oh, I can't trust. - I got you again. - You did, you got me, and I really wanna look again, but you should put your shirt on. - I'm a little prankster tonight. - You are very silly, I'll say that. Okay, you did it, I'm so proud of you. I'm gonna get you some water, okay? I'll be back. - That's so nice. Thank you, you're really nice. - I'm very sweet. - Thanks. - Who's your daddy? - Hey, baby. - Hi, Mick. - How are you? - It's my birthday. I was just wondering if you were gonna call. - I know it's your birthday. I, uh, I wanted to come see you but I have no idea where you are. - I'm in college in Sacramento. - How's college? How are you doing? - I'm good. I'm good. - I haven't talked to you and I-I-I really miss talking to you. - Pidge? - Oh, I have to go. I love you, Dad, bye. What time is it? - One. - In the afternoon? How am I not hung over? - Well, I forced a liter of water down your throat along with two ibuprofens before you went to sleep. What? - It's just that one night, you're drunk. Then the next night, I'm drunk. - Yeah, we're not really in sync, are we? - We're like a disaster. - You know, just thinking we can kick this birthday off with some breakfast in bed. - I would love a coffee. - Coming right up. - Thank you. Oh. - Here you go. - Thank you. You know I was thinking since it's my birthday and our last night together as roommates that maybe we do something special. - What do you have in mind? - Let's look in the magic drawer. A foot massage. - Anything you want. Too much? - No, it's good, it's good. It's really good. Do it again. Okay, okay. Maybe lighter. Maybe lighter, lighter, lighter. - Okay, okay, okay. - Yeah. That's good. My calf's kind of hurting. - And you want me to? - Yes, please. Yeah, that feels good. - Is there anyone else do you want me to massage? - Here. And, maybe here. - Come here. Take this off. Come here. Come here. - Works for me. - Mm-hm. Now take these off. - Yeah, I'll try. Okay. Yeah, look at me. - One. - Two. I got impatient. - Are you okay? - Uh-huh. Is it in? - Is it in? - I got you. - Yeah, you did. - Shut up and just kiss me. - Well, you've exhausted me officially. I think I'm gonna go to sleep. Good night, Abby. - Good night, Travis. - Abby? Abby Abernathy. Good morning. - Good morning. Can I help you? - Uh, this might sound weird, but I'm gonna need you to come with me. - Yeah, no, that's not going to happen. - What if I asked nicely? - Have a nice day. - It's about your dad. - My dad? - Yeah. - What about him? - He's placing bad bets and owes my boss. They're gonna break his legs if you don't come with me. - What? - Hey. - There you guys are, where have you been? - What's going on, man? Just geez. - Abby's disappeared. Now help me look for a clue or anything. - First of all, don't yell at me. Second of all, there's a lot about Abby that you don't know. - I know everything. I know that she's Lucky 13, and now I know that she packed her mattress full of money. - Hang on, I'm tracking her location. She's headed to Vegas. - Vegas? - This isn't good. Wait, hey, that's my phone! - Buy yourself a new one. - Dick. - What? - Hey. - Hey. Hey, Mick. - I'm sorry. - How much do you owe Benny? - A hundred grand. - $100,000, Dad? - I know, I know. - Are you kidding me, Dad? - I'm doing all this stuff, I swear. I'm-I'm doing Gamblers Anonymous and Debtors Anonymous. I've-I've complete. - It works if you work it. Isn't that what they say, Mick? Hello, Abby. How's your game? - I'm retired. - Oh, Abigail, anonymous college student. Well, uh, for your father's sake, I hope it's a short time because he owes me 100 grand by midnight tonight. - Come on. Your own dad wouldn't even lend him any money. You know he has a problem. - Unlike my father, may he rest in peace, I'm not running a daycare, I'm running a business. - Well, 100 grand by tonight is impossible. - We both know, with your talent, you can make that in a day. I used to watch you win 30 grand in 30 minutes underground. Who do you think you're talking to? - I'm underage. - If I get caught, I have to drop out of college. - You've lived here long enough, kiddo. You know how to avoid getting caught. - There has to be another way that we can handle this. - There it is, but you're not gonna like it. - Hey, hey! - No, no, no, no, please no! - I'll do it, I'll do it! - Good to see you again, Abigail. Mick. Hey, enough with the buffet. Get her a room. Leave her the fuck alone. Let's go. Come on, take the top off. What are you doing here? - Wow, wow, wow. - Did you do what I asked? - Yeah, just like you instructed. Are you sure you wanna stay here? There are bigger whales at the Bellagio. - They'll recognize me there. I'm trying to stay under the radar. - Anything else, Your Majesty? - Yeah, give the waitress 200 to start watering down my drinks and go wait outside until I call you. - You got it. - Hey. Are you guys playing poker? - No, it's roulette. - There's a minimum buy-in of five grand. - Ooh, okay, Lion King. - Look at you, you look nice. But this is a high-stakes room. Do yourself a favor and go to the main floor and pick out a shiny slot machine. - I can't go back to the main floor. You see, I'm at this bachelorette party and Cheryl invited this twat, Terry, who hates me because Lyle finger-banged me on Halloween, which in my defense I thought that they were separated. Where's my vibrator? - Huh? - Psst, is this a good hand? What's up with the silent treatment? Hey, Cliff, I like your tiger shirt. Or is it cheetah? - Can you be quiet? - Can I be quiet? Can you be quiet? I'm as quiet as a mouse. Asshole, say what? - What? - Exactly. I've got two black cards. Is that good? - You gotta show your hand. - The cards! - You gotta be kidding me. - Hey, Cliff. Rawr. Okay, well, I'm gonna go meet up with my peeps. It's been real, fellas. And like my dad used to say, if you can't spot the chump in the first 30 seconds, then you're the chump. Bye. - Ma'am? You in the blue dress? Stop. I gotcha. - Jesse. - I totally got you. - Hi. - Come here. - Oh, you scared me. - I bet I did. - Yeah. - Jesus, you look fantastic. - Thank you. So do you. - Thanks. Yeah, security, right? - Great. - Man, I knew I should have asked you to prom. - Right? - For real. - Um, well, I have a, I have a thing to get to. - Oh, yeah, right. - Can I call you? - Yeah, I would love that. I have the same number. - Yeah, I'll give you a call. We'll hang out later. - Awesome. Just one more thing. - Yeah? - I'm gonna need you to give me these chips. - Excuse me? - Come on, Abby. You're underage. You know you can't gamble when you're underage. It's illegal. I don't wanna see you get in trouble. - Jesse, please. I-I need this money. - This is my job. And I would hate to see you go to jail. Abby, give me the chips. I'll totally cover you with my boss, okay? Call me. - Hey. - It's Abby. Are you at the club? - Why, are you okay? - I got caught. - What? - Listen to me, Dad. Get out of the club. Get out of town. Don't use your cell phone. Don't use any of your credit cards and text me when you get a burner phone, okay? We'll figure it out. - I guess I'll leave tonight. I'll hike to Denver. - I'm so sorry, Dad. I let you down. - You called me. You said you had my money. - I had your money, and then it was taken from me by Jesse Viveros. - And that is my problem how? Where's Mick? - He's gone, but we'll find him. - Just go find Jesse. Jesse has your money. - I'm not a charity, and I don't run errands. - Shit. - You know what? Abby, I like you. You're nice. So why don't you? - What are you doing? - Oh, I'm gay. Trust me, you're not my type. I will sponsor all of your entrance fees. The legal age in California is 18, and we'll split the profits 50-50. - Well, I don't wanna play poker for a living. I just wanna go to college. - I'm offering you a compromise. - Abby! - What the fuck? - Travis? - Security. - Are you okay? - Hey, you got to leave right now, okay? - What? - Travis? - That's your one. - You're good. - Taxi. - Call me, bro. - Pigeon? Pigeon? Where are you going? What the heck? - Don't talk to me. - Why? Where are we going? Will you talk to me? Abby, stop! - What? What do you want? - I, uh. - Do you have any idea what you just did? - I wasn't gonna let them hurt you. - They weren't hurting me, I was fine. I was handling it on my own. - How am I supposed to know when you keep everything a secret? I had to track you down to a strip club in Vegas. One day you're dressed like a nun, and then you're wearing this. Who the hell are you? - God. - I love you. - You love me? You don't know me. - That's not true. Whatever you're going through, we can figure it out. - I don't wanna figure it out. I've had enough crazy in my life. I don't want any more crazy. And Travis, you make me crazy! Shit! Get it out, get it out. - I'm trying. - Shit. Come here. I'm so horny, I'm so horny. - I'll try! Okay, I'm trying, I'm trying! - Oh, shit. - Hey, what the fuck is going on over there? - Get these off. What's wrong with your button? - Hey, keep it down, we're trying to sleep. - Oh, oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry, you all right? I-I-I just needed to take off my shoe. - It's okay, come here. Aw. - Hey, knock it off! - Jesus. - What's going on over there? - No. Go back. - Yeah. - Oh, no, in here. - Yeah. - Take this off. Help me get it. - Yeah. - No. - Do you mind? - Okay. - Yeah, put it in. - I don't think it's in. - I-I don't think it's in, I don't think. - It's not in. - Ow! - Oh, sorry. - Ow, okay, okay. Yeah, no, hold on, let's switch, switch. - Ow! - I can't feel anything. - No, no. - Let's get out of here. - Okay. - Abby, Mick still owes me 100 grand and it's on you. Call me. Abby. - No, it's her boyfriend. Look, I-I know that she owes you money, but I think I have a way to get it back to you. - I'm listening. - Travis? What? - Pigeon, don't be mad. I worked out a deal with Benny. I'm gonna fight for him tonight and settle your debt. You and your dad are off the hook. I left a rental car in the parking garage for you to get home. I'll be back before you know it. - Shit. - It's Travis, you know what to do. - Hey, it's me, call me back. You have no idea what you've gotten yourself into. - I see you found my new car. Pretty sick, right? - Yeah, it's nice. Tons of room in there, I like that. - Yeah, man. - So it went okay? - Oh, she told me about it. Handed over the chips, no problem. So what do you think she's gonna do now? She gonna start working for Benny or what? - Ah, yeah, I don't think she has much of a choice at this point. One of the greatest things that I ever heard is if you don't spot the chump in the first 30 seconds, then you are the chump. I, uh, I wanna come see you but I have no idea where you are. - I'm in college. - It's about your dad. - Mick still owes me 100 grand by midnight tonight. - I'm gonna need you to give me these chips. - Get out of the club, get out of town, okay? We'll figure it out. - I guess I'll leave tonight, I'll hike to Denver. - You know, Abby, she's looking pretty hot. - Can you not talk about my daughter, thanks. - No, no, I know. I was just like, "Dang." - Ho, Abby, what are you. - You son of a bitch. - What are you doing? - How's Denver, Mick? - What the hell? Aw. Shit. Obviously, I'm not in Denver. That's not what I meant. I'm going to Den, ow! - You have two seconds to come clean. - To come clean about wha-ow! - You, Benny, Jesse, you guys set me up from the beginning, didn't you? - Abby, Abby, I. - You don't owe Benny any fucking money. - Look at me, I'm an old fucking man. I can't play as good as you play, okay? And I need money, I need money to live. - Then get a job like a normal person. - I know this doesn't look good, okay? I get it. This does not look good. - Yeah, right, yeah. - I love you. - Get out. Get out! - Okay. - Get out! Out of my life. Get out! - Can I get my bag? - Get out! - Abby! - It's Travis, you know what to do. - Travis, call me back. You don't have to fight. No one owes Benny anything. - And now, for the first event this evening we have something very special, the challenger, Travis "Mad Dog" Maddox! - Man, when you said come out to Vegas, I thought you meant the Bellagio. - Hey, I'm gonna fuck your mother, all right? Mad Dog. - Thanks, yeah. Well, she's dead, so you can't. - The lockdown is about to begin in five, four, three, two. - Is there any way I can? - Whore, whore! - Okay. Okay, I'm going, I'm going. - And now, the champion, Chernobyl! - What the fuck. - You're going to die. - Thank you. - Whoever dies, loses. - Chernobyl, Chernobyl. - How's it going? - Chernobyl, Chernobyl. - Awesome. - Come on, can we go? Please. - Shut up! - This is gonna suck. - Yeah, wow. - Let the battle begin. - Yeah, there you go. There you go. - Come on! - Whoo-hoo. - What? Stay in it. Nice, way to go. There you go! - Here, I'll pay for him. - Nice kick! There you go, there you go. Nice, give him the combo. - No bitch, Chernobyl. - You can't use a chain. What is this? - Ref! Stop the fight. This is bullshit. Come here, you son of a bitch. - Can I get through, please? - No, whoa! - Oh, shit. That's my boy, man. - Shit. - Shit, fire! - Fire, fire! - Oh, God! - Hey. - Abby? - Hi. - Shepley, come on. - Come on. - Come on. - I talked to Shepley and he's fine. I'll be on the first flight to Vegas tomorrow. Hey, just a thought, but maybe you wanna check into the Mirage or the Luxor. I-I hear they have deals. - It's fine. Benny's not gonna do anything. His scam didn't work out and no one owes him a dime. Mer, you just have to trust me. Bye. - I don't know if I ever wanna leave this bed, pigeon. - Hey, Travis? - Hm? - Why do you call me pigeon? - You don't know what a pigeon is? - Yeah, it's an annoying bird that craps on people's heads. - No. It's a dove, an attractive girl, a. - A winning hand in poker. - See? You're my pigeon. - I'm an exhausted pigeon. - I bet. - You? - I'm gonna stay up for a little while. - Oh. Are you scared I'm gonna disappear again if you go to sleep? - It crossed my mind. - I love you. I love you, Travis Maddox. - You love me? - It's the tattoos. - They're pretty cool. Sure you wanna do this? - Dude, I was born to ride. - You got some brain damage back there. - I love you, Mommy. Hey, I'll see you back at the ranch. - What? - Corn.
