Jenny, aren't you excited? We're in England. Yes Daddy. Jenny. I miss my friends. I miss my room. I know you do. We had no choice. When the office closed down my job went with it. Inheriting a castle isn't the worst thing that could happen you know. You're right. I'm sorry. Jennifer, first thing we should do when we get there is to go shopping for some warm English tweeds. Would you like that? Sure if you want. (Breaks squeak and train whistles) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Aunt Gretchen said there'd be a chauffeur waiting for us at the station. I wonder if he'll be driving a Bentley or a Rolls-Royce? It's much colder than I thought, here put this over your spring coat. Yes, Ma'am. Are you the Canterville family? Yes. Ah, welcome to England sir. Please! Thank you. Hello, hello. I'm Mrs. Canterville and this is Jennifer.

Hummle Well if you don't mind ma'am, I'd prefer the Mrs. told you about him. Now if you'd sit down there sir and hold on to your good lady cause it could be a bumpy ride - Are you alright there miss? - Yes I'm fine. Off you go Oliver. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ This is so beautiful. Like something out of Wuthering Heights. Or Great Expectations. Jenny aren't you cold up there why don't you scoot back here it's warmer between us. No it's Okay, I'm fine thanks. Ah ha, there she is, there's Canterville castle. And in three months it's all ours. If you can last that long. What'd you say, what? I beg your pardon sir I shouldn't have spoken out like that. That's alright what did you say? Well you see sir no Canterville has ever lasted three weeks. Let alone the three months required to take ownership of the property - that's the sad truth of it sir. - Why is the Hummel, I don't understand? Caroline, Caroline come on, come on! Caroline will you behave yourself! Whoa, Oliver Hummel, Hummel how could you greet my nephew in this terrible wagon? It wasn't my fault ma'am it's him, he's up to his old tricks. Harry, let me look at you. I can't believe it, it's like I'm looking at your father all over again. Aunt Gretchen. It's so nice to see you. - This is my wife. - Oh, Margaret. - No I'm Lucy. - Oh Lucy, please forgive me. Come and meet your new family. I hope that you hand a good journey from the station. It was wonderful actually, the countryside is so beautiful. And this place. Drafty old house. - And this must be Jennifer. - Hello. - Hello my dear, isn't she pretty? - Jennifer. Nephew come and meet your Uncle Hesketh, your Uncle George, and your Aunt Caroline. Harry my boy welcome, now how's the flight? Fine Uncle George, even the food was good. - Splendid. - Hi old man. - Uncle Hesketh, I'm fine. - Feeling fit. I, I had a little shoulder problem but I'm better now. Fine, fine. You don't remember my wife do you, of course you can't you left England when you were two. - This is your Aunt Caroline. - lovely to meet you. Nice to meet you, this is my wife Lucy. - Hello, nice to meet you all. - Nice to meet you. And this is my daughter Jennifer. - How do you do. - Jennifer. What a beautiful place. Well let's go in. - Gracious, no! - Why not? Jennifer, we have a wonderful school here, I'm sure you're going to love it. It's only a short bicycle ride away it won’t take you very long It's very chilly I think we should just go in. - Oh dear god. - The wind, whistles. - Whistles, phew phew. I think somethings happened to Mr. Umney. Oh dear, oh. Excuse me everyone but I'm freezing and it's getting late and something seems to have happened to Hummle so let's just go in. - It's him. - It's who? - it's, it's - It's time to go home. You're quite right my dear it is getting late. - Get in the car. - Get in the car. Now we'll be moving along you have our phone number. Yes, Umney's got the number. Give us a call, thank you. Hummel. Mr. Umney. Mr. Umney. growling noise It's me, must be hungry. - Oh! - What! I'm just kidding. That's not funny, Dad. - Hummle - Up here sir. - Hummel for god's sake! - The Ropes there on the wall sir. - Right! - Oh be very careful sir with that rope. Lucy grab a hold. - OK we got you, come on over here. - Gently Sir. - Hold on, hold on. - Be careful the wall may open up again. Don't worry about a thing you're only a foot from the ground now. Oh, thank you very much ma'am, there we are. Could you just help me with that hook that he's put me on ma'am. I'd be so grateful. There we are, I'll attend to this later. As soon as I find your luggage. Mr. Umney would you please tell us how you got up there? Well you may as well know, it's Sir Simon. He hauled me overhead and hid the luggage. But don't you worry ma'am, I know almost all his hiding places. Who's Sir Simon? Sir Simon de Canterville, the ghost. Mrs. Umney wanted to be here to greet you ma'am, but I'm afraid so Sir Simon's hidden her as well. Don't you worry ma'am she'll show up any minute now she always does. Ah, here she is. Oh you poor thing what's he done to ya? Let me help you. - Tell me something are they here yet? - Yes they are. Good evening. Good evening madame, good evening sir, miss. - Hello, - Hi. I'm Mrs. Umney, the housekeeper and I bid you welcome to Canterville. - Are you alright? - Quite alright thank you for asking. Now let me show you to your rooms. You must be hungry and I have prepared a simple supper. Mrs. Umney, please. Can you just tell us what's going on? Well Madame, Sir Simon heard you were coming and I'm afraid he went on one of his rampages. - The ghost. - That's right. Jenny go get the things would ya? Sir Simon's guilty Spirit owns this Castle. Look there. What is that? Blood that he spilt on that very spot. That's terrible. - Why haven't you cleaned it up? - It can not be removed madame. Then why don't you just for the carpet out? Well that's of no use you see, the stain would just reappear on the floor. I'm sorry I don't understand. It is the blood of Lady Eleanor de Canterville. Who died there in 1635. Now some say she was murdered by her husband Sir Simon. (Whispering) What happened to him? - Pardon? - Sir Simon what happened... (Whispering) He disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances. And, his body has never been found. There he is, right there next to his wife. They say the color just went right out of it, like hair turning white overnight. For my part, I have seen things with my eyes that would make your hair stand on end. and many a night, I have not closed my eyes in sleep. Knowing as I do the terrible things that have taken place here. That's very interesting Mrs. Umney. Perhaps you could show us to our rooms. Certainly Madame right this way. Now I'm sorry there's only Mr. Umney and myself to help you out here. Jenny don't be frightened by any of this someone's trying to play a trick on us. Your dad's right, now there is no ghost. Woman! You are mistaken. I am Sir Simon de Canterville. This is my property, you are trespassing. You are intruding, be gone! When the Owl beats against the window pane. The raven croaks from the old yew-tree. When the wind goes moaning 'round the house like a lost soul. Then the deeds of blood be wrought murder walk abroad with silent feet. (LOUD SCARY MOANING) (LOUD SCARY MOANING) The sound effect of the chains is very good but a little too loud you can lower it Hummel. What's that? It's a great effect I've got to admit. Silence! for those who live be filled with ruin. I don't think so! I warn you woman! - Thank you. - Lucy! Well how do you suppose they did that? Can we please see our rooms now, we really don't appreciate these Halloween tricks Mrs. Umney. They weren't no tricks madame. Oh dear me no. They come as easy as pie to him. - If you'll follow me madame. - Thanks. Wasn't that a kick Jen? Halloween came a little early this year. - Yeah! - Yeah. Daddy! Remind me to get that ceiling repainted. - (laughs) No wallpaper. (Knock on the door) Yes? Could you open the door please sir? Yes! - What is it Hummel? - Your luggage sir, and madame. Great I'll take this piece. Thank you very much indeed, that's very kind of you. - Hummel. - Sir? - Where did you find it? - He put it all back in the wagon sir. Hummle that's alright I'll take it. Oh, thank you very much sir. Will there be anything else? - No thank you goodnight. - Goodnight to you sir. - Do you think he's in on it with them? - Absolutely. It's obvious your English relatives want us out of here so we won't get control of the property. There is no ghost. Everything we saw tonight was rehearsed. But it's not gonna to work. We're much, much too smart for them. I love your eyebrows. My eyebrows love your eyebrows. My whole face, loves your face. I'm glad you married me. And my lips are glad you married me. Do you know that tomorrow's our three-month anniversary? Today, we're still on Cleveland time. - We're gonna love it here. - I hope so. I hope Jennifer learns to love me, I mean England, No! I mean me. She will. She still misses her mom. It's been for years since Margaret died, I was hoping. I know, I know. Don't take it personally She'll find it difficult, but she'll get closer to you, just give her time. (Screams) How do you suppose they did that? Jeffery. I shall soon make short work of these brazen, impudent upstarts. Excuse me sir. Jeffery. May I speak with you? Please. (Loud Moaning) Are you frightened? Good. Be gone! I knew you were a real ghost even though Lucy didn't. And I think what you are dong is very good. Ya see Lucy's my stepmother. My real mom died four years ago. My dad's so sweet but, I know I shouldn't feel this way but I can't help it. So, if you can, you know sort of scare her off. I'd really appreciate it. I think you're doing a great job so far. Thank you very much. - Why aren't you afraid of me? - I don't know. I've never been so grossly insulted. I frightened thousands of people into fits of hysterics merely by grinning at them Poor old Madame de Tremouillac, was confined to her bed for six weeks from an attack of brain fever. When she awoke early one morning and saw me seated in her armchair by the fire, reading her diary. Her butler shot himself when he saw my green fingers tapping on the pantry window. And Lady Stutfield a great beauty, was obliged always to wear a black velvet band around her throat to hide the marks of my five fingers burnt on her skin. And you do not fear me? No. One peel of my demonic laughter is said to have turned Lord Raker's wig gray in a single night. Listen, (WILD SCARY LAUGHTER) (WILD SCARY LAUGHTER) That is wonderful! I can't believe it. Go away. go back to wherever you came from. We can't we sold our house in Cleveland this is where we live now. Leave me! Yes, well I'm going, I do have to go to bed. Of course you can sleep, you have merely to climb into bed and blow out the candle. But I haven't slept for three hundred years and I'm so tired. Ohhhh! Why can't you sleep? Look around this chamber. Well, you know it wouldn't be so bad if you cleaned it up. All you really need are some pictures. Ahh, and a heater, you definitely need a heater. TV would be nice. Let's see what else? Bed, there's no bed. And there hasn't been one in three hundred years. No wonder you haven't slept. You don't understand I long to sleep but cannot. Not since that terrible day. If I could but once lie down, I could at last take my place in the soft brown earth. The grasses waving above my head and listen to silence. To finally have no yesterday, no tomorrow. To forget time, to forgive life. To be at peace, my soul freed for death. If only there could be an end to the endless. You want to die? It's all I live for. Maybe if you stopped haunting, you know if you behaved. It's absurd to talk to me about behaving quite absurd. I have to rattle my chains and groan through keyholes and walk about at night. It's my only reason for existing. maybe if you prayed maybe if you stopped Maybe it's time you removed yourself from this apartment. You, and those two ridiculous creatures that you are standing in. Right, I'm going, I just want to say that meeting you has been the most incredibly wonderful experience GO! We have an ally Jeffery. Once I frighten the stepmother away, the father will follow and then the child, and we shall soon be rid of the whole damned lot of them. - Morning. - Morning, Ma'am. - What happened? - I had a bit of an accident. Good morning Hummel. Good morning miss, I trust you slept well? - Oh yeah great, thank you. - Good Good, oh dear. - What's the matter - Look up there. - Up there, up there. - Daddy! What are you doing, be careful! Don't worry Jen, I'm fine! - What' he doing? - Looking for wires miss. Wires? Yes, you see Mrs. Canterville is of the opinion that Sir Simon is a creation of electronics. Hidden microphones, projectors, wires and the such like. - But that's not true. - That's not for me to say miss. Well then I will, Daddy there are no wires come down. - Hi Sweetheart, what did you say? - Daddy I'm scared! Don't be silly I'm perfectly okay. Oh no Sir! don't put your feet down there... (Screams) Daddy hold on! Go get help. Daddy hold on! Help! Daddy! Daddy? Daddy, Daddy. Daddy give me your hand Be careful of your back Now be very careful in case you've injured yourself. When you jump off here be careful don't jar yourself. - Daddy are you alright? - Are you alright? Yes, I'm fine I can't believe it, boy! what a tumble. I'll make you a nice cup of tea and draw you a bath. - Thank you Hummel. - Are you sure you're not hurt? Yes I'm fine sweetheart, no broken bones, no parts missing. My lungs are up in my forehead but they'll be back soon. - I ain't seen nothing like that before. - Lucky for me, you saved my life. - tweren't none of my doing. What do you mean it tweren't none of your doing? What I said boss. - Well you were driving it. - I wasn't. - Well who was? - I don't know. - Is it coming out? - Yes madame. Good. But when you remove it, it just comes back. Are we going to start that again today? Every time I do this, I'm the one that suffers not anybody else. Okay, okay I'll do it, really I can't live with it. - Where did you put the cookies? - On the kitchen table. - Well they're not there. - Sir Simon must have taken them. Jen I hope you aren't letting any of this talk about ghosts spoke you. - No. - Good. Because they're just having a little Halloween game with us. And it's a little early for trick-or-treat. Do you think that you might find those cookies for us Mrs. Umney. Certainly madame, I'll go and look for them. There's no guarantee of their safe return, or mine. Well we'll be right here if you need us just call. Indeed I will madame, indeed I... They're going to get tired of this sooner or later. Don't you worry about it okay Hun. Okay, Lucy Mrs. Umney just disappeared. What? She was going through there but just disappeared. (Sir Simon's voice) Trick-or-treat? I'm just as surprised at my behavior as you are Jeffery. Shocking to think that I could actually rescue somebody. especially an interloper. I'm most ashamed, I must be getting very old and sentimental. Jeffery, don't look at me that way. - May I come in? - No. I just want to thank you for saving my father, I really appreciate it. I don't know what you're talking about please go away. Why is your parrot upside down like that? Yoga, close the door behind you. You know Sir Simon, I've been having a real cool time here and it's all because of you. We Americans and you English sure do have a lot in common. Um, except of course our language. You look beautiful your ladyship. So do you Lord Canterville. (Scary music playing) What the matter. Lucy what's wrong? Lucy! It wasn't my face in the mirror. It was this hideous old woman staring at me. Ah, baby. Ha, ha everyday it's something new, something awful. Yesterday I reached into the wardrobe to get out a dress and and this bony hand caught hold of mine and and this morning in the library I felt icy cold fingers on my neck and sometimes I think I hear voices. I'm scared all the time Harry, what is going on? Somebody's trying to get rid of us and we mustn't let it happen. But how do they do it? it's driving me crazy. I don't know Luce, this place will be ours soon. Please don't give up yet, we've got to hang on. I'm trying. Yeah, listen to me for a minute. I've been going over the finances of the castle. and in a few months we won't be able to pay our way here. Harry? I didn't want to tell you until I had it all wrapped up, but I received and offer. What kind of an offer? To sell Canterville castle. From the Excalibur hotel corporation. The ones that take all those old buildings and turn them into modern hotels. When we take possession of this place they will pay us a lot of money to turn it into one of their gracious inns. Like they did with the old YMCA in downtown Cleveland. We'll be free to get out of here and live anywhere we want. - London, Rome - Paris? Paris, so what do you think? Can you hold on for a few more weeks. (Knock at door.) Yes? Oh, excuse me, your guests have arrived sir. Thank you. Oh by the way Mrs. Canterville, I'm sorry the spot's back. Lucy, the table just looks magnificent. Here, Here. You've done wonders with this old deep freeze. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You know my dear we owe you an apology. Our behavior was unnecessarily mysterious when you arrived and I would like to explain it to you now. - If you'd like to Aunt Gretchen. - I would indeed. I'm sure by now you've met the ghost. Dear Gaw. We thought it was inappropriate to bring it up that night. And we were worried in case Caroline became hysterical. Of all of us she's been most traumatized by Sir Simon. What did he do to you? - Dear Gaw, Gaw, Gaw, Gaw. - Sorry, sorry, sorry. Please can we just stop all of this right now. I don't know how it is that you've done all these things but we know exactly what you're after and I promise you it's not going to scare us away. But my dear we want you to stay, we all have a great deal of money at stake. Don't you realize if you were driven away we'd lose all rights to the interest in the estate's profits. We'd be penniless, you are our only hope. I see. Here we are sir. Sir Simon is quite harmless you know he just loves dressing up that's all. Has he appeared to you yet as Black Isaac the Huntsman of Hogley Woods? Or Count Ghouley the vampire monk? One night he came in a long shroud covered in churchyard mold, and in his hand was a small lantern and a sexton's spade covered in blood. He called himself Jonas the grave-less the corpse snatcher of Chelsey bog. What about reckless Rupert the headless earl. Wait! What about dessert? Come on, Come on. The parties over Uncle George. Run! So long, don't be frightened we'll see in two or three months or so. Go on off you go John, Caroline hold on. I guess he's real. And I guess we're going to have to live together. For awhile at least. (knocking on door) Come in. - Hi. - Hi! I thought you might be hungry so I scrapped some food off the floor and walls for you. Daddy! Actually this is probably the only food in the house that Sir Simon missed. - How ya doing? - I'm alright. Well you were right Jen. Sir Simon's real and you were the only one that believed it. I'm sorry honey. Listen, we might not have to live here much longer. I've received an offer from a company that wants to turn the castle into a hotel, an inn. You know, like for tourists and stuff. But in the mean time, I won't let him hurt you and I don't want you to be scared. I'm not scared, I understand what he's trying to do. Harry, Harry. Come quick. He's buried all my clothes in the garden and Hummel too, right up to his neck Oh no, Okay, Okay. I'll be right back Jen. We have triumphed Jeffrey, I wish you could have seen them cowering and running from the room. It reminded me of my great achievements in days gone by. Never since I took the guise of gaunt Gideon, the blood sucker of Bexley moor have I known a greater success. When Lady Startup saw me as Gideon on that fatal New-years eve in the year 1764. She went off into the most piercing shrieks which culminated in a violent apoplexy and died within three days. It was all together most successful. (Knocking at door) I cannot tolerate these constant interruptions. - May I come in? - Pray when is your family leaving? - I don't know. - I don't understand you people. Do you mean to say that after all I've put you through at dinner you're actually thinking of staying on. I think so. Then tonight as Martin the maniac, I shall find my way quietly to your parents' bedroom and gibber at then foot of their bed and stab myself three times to slow music. Then I shall place a clammy hand on your stepmother's forehead and hiss in her ear, the awful secrets of the torture chamber. At last, I shall stand there in the form of a green icy cold corpse until she's paralyzed with fear, and finally fling off my winding sheet and crawl around the room with white bleached bones and one rolling eyeball. That's terrific, but I don't think it will work. One must admire the unflagging nature of your stepmother's spirit. It is altogether admirable, but also quite odious. I shall deliberate in the next two days to find a more satisfactory solution. - Hi - Hello I'm Paul Blaine. - Nice to meet you. - I'm Jenny Canterville. Canterville I know, we've heard about you. You're living up there at the castle tell us, what's it like? - It's different! - Wait a minute. I'm anxious to know about canterville we've heard all those stories for years and years. What stories? Oh about the ghost of Sir Simon and how he killed his wife Lady Eleanor. - I don't believe that's true. - Well have you seen where they're buried. - No. - Come on then, I'll show you. Lady Eleanor de Canterville Rebecca de Canterville and Sir Simon de Canterville. - His stone is only a date of birth. - What does that prove? If he died there'd be a date of death and that means he's a ghost. He's being punished for killing his wife. (Scary Moaning) - Sir Simon, this is a friend of mine, Paul Blaine Boo. Boo hoo hoo ho ho ho hah ha ha ha. - That was not very nice. - Good. - You nearly frightened him to death. - Just doing my job. But I like Paul. Stop trying to fill me with your childish guilt. The boy did a perfectly normal thing, he ran away. You and your rude, horrid, vulgar family might learn from his example. You're the rude and horrid one not us. We never killed an... I've suffered untold agonies for more than three hundred years. - This is quite intolerable. - Well I Well I won't be bothering you anymore. (tapping sound) Come in. - What are you doing here. - I came to talk to you. I'm busy. Who are these charming ladies? That's me and my real mother. She's very beautiful. You look just like her. Are those your ear warmers? awfully unsubstantial especially in these cold nights. - They're headphones. - Hmmmm? Try them on, they go on your ears over your head. Okay, now turn that thing. What thing? That little wheel right there turn it to the right. (Loud music) - Sir Simon? - Yes. - Where are you? - Never mind. - Are you alright? - Yes, I'm fine thank you. - Did you get scared? - Don't be foolish. - I was only momentarily surprised. - I'm sorry, I really think you got scared. Now you're being impertinent. I don't get scared, I do the scaring! You're yelling at me again, is that why you came to see me? - No! - You came to apologize, you like me. You're just afraid to admit it. You like me so much, that you even saved my father. Nonsense, why would I save a man who was foolish enough to marry a woman like that? Oh really! Wait until you hear this. My father and that woman are going to sell this castle. So it can be turned into an Inn, for tourist. - Tourist! What are tourist? - People that take vacations. People like my stepmother. Exactly like her. By the bones of my ancestors she has just sealed her fate. - Good morning angel. - Good morning baby. - Sleep well? - mmh how bout you? - great, want some coffee? - Yeah! - I'll get it. - No let me. No I insist. - Awww. - What! - Lucy! - Harry help me. Come on honey, come on, get up. Sir Simon did this! - Oh no, ha ha. - Come on Luce. Harry, Harry we can not live like this one more day you have got to do something please. I will, I will! Yes? - I'm Dr. Cook. - Hello. From the University department of parapsychology. Come in, we've been expecting you. I have some equipment can someone give me a hand with it? Of course, let me get my coat. I've done a bit of research into Simon de Canterville He's quite a character, it appears he murdered his wife right here in this castle in 1635. Yes we know about that professor Cook. - Do you think you can get rid of him? - Oh, I wish I could tell you yes. But the truth is all this is.. highly experimental and based on theory rather than fact. - I'll do the very best I can. - I'm sure you will. Tell me, is there any one place the spirit appears most frequently? He appears anywhere and everywhere. What I have to do you see is find one particular place create an electrical field around it which will repel the spirit and drive him away. Aside from Sir Simon, himself. Is there any other persistent phenomenon which occurs here? Well, there's a blood spot on a carpet no matter how we try to clean it up. It keeps coming back. Most interesting. As a matter of fact our housekeeper tells us is the exact spot where lady Eleanor was killed. Yes, that might be worth investigating. Oh and you'll handle the rest of my stuff won't you? No problem. - I can't sleep, can you sleep? - Nope. What's he doing down there? He thinks the spot has a direct connection to Sir Simon's existence. He's created an electrical force field around it. Go to sleep. I can't. I wish we could watch. Me too, Professor Cook says we mustn't divert any energy. Let's try and get some rest. He started the experiment. Ooh, oww Lucy don't ever jump on a man like that. Ready! Ready, set. GO! (Click) (Machines beeping, buzzing, and humming) ( More buzzing, snaps and bleeps) (Louder and faster) Ssssimon. Eleanor. Eleanor. Forgive me. Ssssimon. Ssssimon. (Cracks, pops and explosions) (Cracks, pops and explosions) Bring her back, do you here me? Bring her back! Are you sure you wouldn't like some more sausages professor cook. No, well perhaps a few. So Mrs. Umney you haven't seen Sir Simon, is that right? - Absolutely not - and Mr Umney hasn't seen him either. Not a sign of him anywhere, not for the last nine days. I do believe Sir Simon has vacated at last. It might be, that the site of the manifestation drove Simon out of the house. I've tried several times after my initial success but couldn't recall the female apparition. - Well maybe he's gone for good. - Yes maybe he has. And perhaps your work here is finished? Yes, perhaps. - May I be excused? - Yeah sure, wait, wait, wait. - You didn't eat breakfast you made art. - Thanks! - Just not hungry, bye. - Bye. Well I think that we all owe professor cook our thanks that we had nine days of peace and quiet. - Yes, thank you so much. - Is there any more toast Mrs. Umney? - Certainly Sir. - And some plum Jam. (Sir Simon sneezes) - Bless you. - What? - I said God bless you. - Why would he do that? Because you sneezed. Don't be foolish ghosts don't sneeze. You know. You've been here for over a week. You've probably caught a cold. Impossible ghosts don't catch cold. Never the less you've caught a cold. Well my forehead is very hot. Come on let's go. In a moment. I saw what happened the other night. That was my beloved wife. I heard you ask her to forgive you. She must know you're sorry you killed her. I didn't kill her. She tried to strike me, she fell down the stairs and died. She blamed me for our daughter's death. You see I was the magistrate of this district. But I was more interested in other pursuits that would add to my fortune. I neglected my responsibility in maintaining the roadways and bridges. And when one of those bridges collapsed my daughter was killed. I was responsible for both their deaths. I'm so sorry. My wife died in my arms. With her last words, she cursed me forever. Simon she said. May you Never know a moments happiness. Or share in the wealth of human love. We better go home now. This is my home. - Anything else you need? - Yes open the window. Open the window, you'll die of pneumonia. Do you really think so. You just rest. We have to think of a way to talk Dad and Lucy out of selling this place. I mean, if you have to stay here you might as well do it in peace and quiet. Good-night. Jennifer. I should just like to say how much I appreciate all you do for me. I really look forward to your daily visits. Although it might not always have seemed that way. You are to me, as my own daughter was. You made existing as I do, bearable. Now go away. Really! - Hi. - Hi. I'm sorry we haven't gotten together since that day but that was weird you know. I'd never seen anything like that before. I was frightened away like a little child. I was afraid you wouldn't think very highly of me. Are we still friends? You bet! - Jenny I'm here. - Hi Dad. - I gotta go. - Okay bye Jen, see you tomorrow. He's so cute! - Hi. - Hi. - Hi dad. - Hi. - Listen who's that guy I.. - I gotta go change. - You like in here don’t you Jen. - More and more. That's great, I was worried about you. leaving all the kids back home. All the kids you grew up with. But you've adjusted terrifically I'm happy to see you've made some friends here at least one. Me too, listen dad. You could help me with him. What'd ya mean. Well see ever since the first night we got here I've sort of been visiting with him. Visiting with whom? Sir Simon, I've talked to him at least fifty times. - He wants to talk to you. - Me! What for? About your plans for selling the castle he doesn't think it's, perspicacious. He has a wonderful vocabulary. - Jenny I don't think it's a good. - Dad I'm telling you, you'll like him. Yeah sure. He's the one that saved you when you fell off the roof. He steered that wagon of hay under you. - He did that? - Yeah, Dad for me please. Okay, okay, When's he want to talk to me? As soon as we get home. Please come in. It's me Sir Simon and my dad's here... - Can we have the door open please? - Can we have the door open please? - Thank you. - Are you okay? - He's floating. - He's a ghost. - Sir Simon. - mmm hmmm. It' my pleasure to introduce to you my father. - How do do do sir? - I’m good, how are you? - You have a terrible cough Sir Simon. - Perhaps it will be the death of me. Wishful think alas. May I offer you some brandy? - It might help to keep you warm. - Well it is a kinda chilly in here. - I have a wonderful twenty-five. - 25 wow, was 1925 a good year? I'm afraid I have know means of knowing. I'm referring to 1625. The year that King Charles the first succeeded to the throne of Britain. King Charles the first, say didn't the people chop his head off? - Did they really? - They sure did in 1649. After my lifetime I'm afraid, I always knew he'd come to a bad end. Here try this. - That's quite smooth. - Quite delicious. - Is it always this cold up here? - Seasonable for the time of year. Well when we go I'm sure the new owners will fix that. They put central heating in right away. - Central heating? - Oh, they'll do it very tastefully. Concealed vents, color coordinated with the right kind of insulation in the roof this old place will be good and toasty. Insulation? I'll bet they'll have multi-channel video in every room. TV? It's sort of a box with moving colored pictures. - People, dancers, actors. - Actors Even the king's players were renowned for being the scum of London. The bottom line is I received a great offer from an international hotel chain. They want to turn this place into what they call a gracious inn. An inn, you want to turn Canterville into a common tavern? The infamous haunt of vagabonds, cut purses and strumpets. I don't think they'd let any cut purses in, just respectable tourists. Ah, people of your time of course. From the scraps of rumor that I've managed to pick up from time to time. Your time is one of famine and pestilence. Revolution, and to not put to fine a point upon it, bloody war. I can't help it, I have to sell. I can't afford to run the place. Harry Canterville, you bear a great name and a deep responsibility. Your great fore bearer H'orrie Canterville, who's bowman severed under William the conqueror. Laid the first stone on this plot to found our dynasty. The noble Percy de Canterville past through these gates on his way to join Richard the lion-heart on his third crusade to the holy land. The baron Edmund de Canterville left this Castle to confront King John at Runnymede and force him to sign the great charter of English rights the Magna Carta. For hundreds of years sir, Canterville swords have dispatched England's enemies throughout Europe all in the name of loyalty to this green country. And now sir you propose to turn this castle, this font of such great chivalry and tradition into a stinking ale house! Not exactly. I don't understand, I thought you wanted us to leave. Listen Harry, there's one more thing you need to know. What's that? While this castle remains in the hands of our family - There's always hope for me. - Hope, Sir Simon? A forlorn hope, that perhaps one day a Canterville will find the key which shall release me from my ghostly state. But with Canterville in alien hands, I am condemned the torment of perpetual purgatory. Oh no, Dad you can't. We can't afford to stay Jenny, what else can we do? Do as your family has always done. Farm your lands, restore this castle to be the center of enlightenment and culture it once was. - Do you think I could? - You are a Canterville. Yes, I am. - How will I explain this to Lucy? - Your wife is a mere woman. Women aren't mere any longer Sir Simon. Well tell her we men have come to an agreement. - Have we? - Of course. If you give me your word that there will be no more talk of selling this castle. I will guarantee to cease my disturbances and permit you and your family to live here in peace and quite forever after. - You mean that? - Those are my terms. - Sounds fair to me dad. - They'll be problems. - Which will you will face like a Cant - Canterville, yes. - Okay Sir Simon, I'll discuss it. - Well you have just 48 hours. - Chose wisely Harry. Let's go Jen. Oh by the way what does perspicacious mean? To be acute in understanding without fear of the future. Get it? Got it. Good. Not sell? But it was going to solve all our problems. It's a wonderful idea. This castle is a Canterville's own special place. - It' our birthright. - Yours not mine. I'm Lucy Swackhammer remember, of the Cleveland Swackhammers. We can't sell it, ever. It wouldn't be fear to him. - To whom? - Sir Simon. - I don't know what you're talking about. - I met him today Luce. I had a drink with him. Jenny introduced us, she's been talking with him ever since we got here. Sir Simon told me that he won't bother us anymore if we leave the castle the way it is. We can stay here as long as we want. He's even called a truce for the next 48 hours. London. Paris, Rome. I'm sorry, I spoke too soon. Jenny wants to stay, I have to stay. What are you doing? Well I was going to back a few things but it seems your ancestor, Sir Simon has done it for me. - Where are you going? - I need some time to think. London, maybe I could look for work or I'll go back to Cleveland, at least my mother will be happy to see me. Lucy wait! Oh, Sir Simon it's a truce you promised. I' kill him! What am I crazy, that' just what he wants. Hummle! Mrs. Umney! Mrs. Umney! Never mind that Hummel please get the car. Oh yes Madame. - Your coat me lady. - Thank you Hummel. Mom? Wait a minute, what's going on? Where are you going? - I'm leaving. - Why? Because I'm not happy here just now Jennifer. It isn't anybodies fault. Take care of yourself and take care of your dad, Okay? We're making wonderful time. We're almost there aren't we? it's true ma'am, it's as if somebody changed all the signs in our favor. Hummel! - Daddy! - Jen. -Yeah. - Jenny. - Open the door! - I can't Sir Simon locked me in. Why, what happened, why did Lucy leave? Would you just get this door open please? Okay. - I'll get Mrs. Umney. - No, you'll have to get him. Sir Simon. - Okay, I will! - Okay. - Sir Simon! - What? - Simon! - Simon. Yeah, Simon. Good heavens! Never do things like that, you'll add years to my life. Why did you lock my father in his room? Well he tried to stop your stepmother from leaving and I prevented him from doing so. He'll thank me one day. - Please open his door. - Suppose he tries to bring her back? Just please open his door, please. Very well. - What's going on? - Ah Jen, I've made a mess of everything. I love you sweetie, but I love her too and I don't want to lose her. I didn't think about Lucy's feelings and I hurt her. I think we bot hurt her. I'm sorry. I know, I'm going to go get her. Hummel how long have you and Mrs. Umney been married? 23 years, mom. Or is it 33? Hello? Who's it? Mrs. Umney? He's never hidden mean in here before miss. I suppose he thought I needed meditation. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - An old chapel huh? - Yes it is miss. This is where the Canterville's were married, where the were baptized and where their funerals were. Wen a golden girl can win? Prayer from out the lips of sin. When the, something, almond bears. I can't read this. Okay here we go. Then peace something to Canterville? Sounds like some kind of riddle. - What does it mean Mrs. Umney? - I'm sure I don't know miss. Must be something to do with the curse I suppose. I think I'll be running along miss. God Bless us everyone. You broke your promise, why did you stop my father from going to get Lucy? - I thought that's what you would want. - That's not what I want. - Well what do you want? - I want her back. Please. Very well, consider it done. Lucy, Lucy! I thought I would never get here. - I'm glad you came after me. - I made a mistake. No I made a mistake. I don't care where we live. And I don't want to live there without you. Come back with me. I love you. Jennifer I've no heart for haunting anymore, I'm exhausted. - though not Alas, terminally so. - What does that poem mean? Please tell me. Well, it means that someone has to pray for my soul because I have no faith. Then perhaps the angel of death will have mercy on me and I shall rest at last. Cam I help you? Let me help you. I'm not afraid, I'll pray to the angel of death himself. No, you mustn't do that. For any communication with him might be fatal. I'm not afraid I'll pray to him to let you die. Take me to him, please. I warn you, you'll see dark and dreadful shapes and fearsome voices will whisper in your ear. Do you dare to come with me? - Where are we going? - I'll tell you. Nearby there's a little garden. Where the grass grows long and deep. There the great white stars of the hemlock flower. Where the nightingale sings all night long. All night long he sings and the cold crystal moon looks down. And the Yew tree spreads out his giant arms over the sleepers. It is the garden of death. -Oh ma'am, sir. - What is it Mrs. Umney? It's Jennifer Ma'am, she's gone. I think he took he. - Who took her. - Sir Simon. He hid me in the chapel and then she came in. Where's the chapel? (Scary music, and sounds) (Scary music, and sounds) This is where I died. There the vengeful brothers of my darling wife left me to starve. That's a terrible way to die. Terrible and lonely. You've be punished enough Sir Simon. Please lift the curse from Sir Simon. I know he did a terrible thing but it was a long time ago. I think he's sorry for what he did. I know he is. You've got to let him go. Please let him die. He didn't hear a word I said. I'm sorry. I wanted to help you so much. But you have. You found the missing part of the prayer. Wen a golden girl can win with prayer from out the lips of sin. When the barren almond bears And a little child gives way her tears. Then shall all the house be still, and peace come to Canterville. Do you understand? Your tears have set me free. Sir Simon. At last, at last I shall be at rest. - I'll miss you. - Good-bye dear child. Sir Simon wait. - Miss Jennifer! - Hi Mr. Umney. - Miss Jennifer. - What's wrong? Miss Jennifer is nowhere to be found. We're afraid Sir Simon has taken her. - Mr. Umney. - Yes! I think I know where she might be. Well come with me. Jenny. - Jen! - Jen. Jenny, Jenny are you alright? Jen! - Where you been? - With Sir Simon. Where is he? He's gone For good. Sir Simon de Canterville 1575 to 1635. I'm sorry honey. Me too. Could we stay here for a while. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
