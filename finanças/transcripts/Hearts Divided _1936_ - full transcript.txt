This territory of Louisiana which France now owns. Must belong to the United States. The Mississippi is our main artery. It is necessary that we control it. At any cost. Don't you agree, Tom? As Thomas Jefferson, I agree heartily. But as the President? I don't like the phrase 'At any cost'. Napoleon should understand our point of view. He understand the French point to view better. He has closed the Mississippi to American commerce. And unless we can regain the right of navigation. The West will never be developed. A million square miles. The site of a potentially great nation. Why should France yield us an inch of this territory? Why? Because she can't defend it. Britain has too strong a navy. That is exactly what Monroe and Livingstone are going to tell Napoleon. Well, let's hope they find him receptive. Louisiana. Louisiana. A wilderness, eh? - Relatively, Consul. Devoid of population, you say? That is correct, Consul. Teaming with savages. Nasty tastes in mayhem. You stated I believe. The Indians are most unfriendly, sir. Really, gentlemen. From what you tell me of Louisiana. I'd feel guilty selling it to you while the wilds of Borneo are purchasable. I recognise your pleasantry, sir. But let me remind you. That the wilds of Borneo are no more remote .. From America. Than Louisiana from France. Also, let me remind you .. - Yes. I know. We could not defend the territory from an attack by the British Navy. You anticipated what I was going to say. Small wonder. When every time you open your mouth the British Navy sails out. If we have become repetitious, Consul. It is because, as yet, we received no definite statement from you. Which we could communicate to our government. Oh. And does my procrastination .. Exasperate, Mr Livingstone? Because if it does. I advise you to return to the United States and no longer try your patience. You have exhausted mine. We are authorised to make you an offer. - Then make it. Six and a half million dollars. Refused. Cambaceres. I want a detailed requisition on this. Not a general one. Monsieur le Consul. Although we consider our offer fair .. - Let's spare my time and your breath. Will you propose your terms then? Propose them? No. I will state them. Twenty million dollars. Good day, gentlemen. Advise the recruiting office that I want the enlistment rate increased. Thirty percent by next month. We will advise Washington. Yes. Good day, gentlemen. Good day. Cambaceres. How was my performance? It only lacked the footlights to make it art. I hope so. I need that twenty million. Is my brother about? Yes, Consul. Captain Jerome has waited some time. Good. Send him in. - Very well, Consul. From what I hear of his escapades lately he needed the rest. You look tired, Napoleon. I did not sleep well last night. That Infernal neuralgia again. Did you ever hear of the Princess of Wurttemberg? Yes. I know a cavalry officer who met her. He said she not not only looked like a horse but danced like one. He swore she was positively 5-gaited. The important factor is not how she moves but where she sits. Which in this instance happens to be on a throne to which she is the sole heir. Furthermore, she is unmarried. However. That's not the reason I sent for you. You are going to America. - America? You will be my representative for negotiating the sale of Louisiana. And make a goodwill tour. But when you talk, don't say anything. And remember. I may be only your brother, but I'm the great Napoleon to the rest of the world. A goodwill tour. Have you ever been on a goodwill tour? No. I've done all my touring with an army. Then just picture sitting down to one banquet after another. I get indigestion thinking of it. Any man should be willing to lay down at least one stomach for his country. May I suggest you send someone else's stomach? If you would rather. You can pay a semi-official visit to Wurttemberg. If he had been a sailor or an infantry officer. I might take a chance. But when a cavalry officer tells you a woman looks like a horse. He knows what he's talking about. See your mother today and tell you are leaving for America immediately. I'm not going over there to be scalped by a lot of Indians. I won't do it. Jerome. I will miss you. I might as well argue with the rock of Gibraltar. Ellen. Charles, at your age it is no longer cute. To tiptoe up behind old ladies and bellow in their ear. No-one but yourself considers you an old lady. They don't, eh? Last night I was in the garden with a delightful gray-haired ambassador. When I mentioned I was cold. The cad went in and brought me a wrap. Maybe he was shy. - Don't be a fool. He was the French ambassador. - That reminds me. The welcoming committee has informed me. That Jerome Bonaparte is to occupy my box during the races. Oh, that Frenchman. - That Frenchman? The brother of Napoleon comes to honor Baltimore with a visit. And you dare call him 'that Frenchman'? You want me to call him a Fiji Islander? No. But after all, he is Napoleon's brother. Well, if that doesn't make him a Frenchman. The family is too complicated to be respectable. Where is Betsy? She would have the good grace to enthuse about this news. She went for a walk this morning leaving the three pests perched on the veranda. You mean .. I mean those two eminent members of the United States Senate. Henry and John. And Sir Harry. That flower of English aristocracy. Who persists in going to seed around here. Ellen, is there nothing you have any respect for or any confidence in? Yes. Dr Beecham's rheumatism salve. What is the time? Time? What is the time? The time? The hour? Yes. Ten-thirty. To the tick. To the tick. You had better make sure. I am not so certain he can tell time. Yes. I thought as much. Are you certain you haven't seen Betsy? No. And I have an engagement to teach her to sing La Marseillaise. You teaching her to sing. - What is wrong with my voice? I am surprised it does not file your teeth down to the gums. Oh dear. You see? Now you've done it. Done what? - Given me goose pimples. It will be hours before that levels down. Sorry, gentlemen. I did not know you were here. You look well, senator. I am not really. It's my liver. It's torturing me. It's torturing everybody else too. Learning to like our country I hope, Sir Harry. Yes. Yes indeed. A cozy little colony. Let me remind you that since 1776 we are no longer a colony of Britain. Really? By gad, if his majesty finds out he will be most annoyed. I wonder if he's heard the ugly rumor about Julius Caesar being stabbed. Was he? Oh. I wonder. Yes. Is Miss Betsy about by any chance? Would you mind looking in the orchard? I'll go and ask Isham if he's seen her. Not at all. Not at all. So we're off the rescue. Tally ho. Yikes. Tell me, senator. Have you ever seen anyone quite so annoying? Yes. She is not in the orchard. I wonder if anything could have happened to her. Perhaps the Indians have got her. When I think I fought in the revolution without getting a shot at him. Somehow, the victory seem all very hollow. Hollow? That's it. Let's holler. Hollo! Hello. Did you hear that? That was an echo. They have discovered .. Are you an echo? Absolutely. Just as I thought. It's an echo. That is Betsy. Betsy. Where are you? Over here. She is over here. I say, wait a minute. Isn't it marvelous the way he attacks these trees. Yes. Isn't it? With all the fervour of an enterprising woodpecker. He has the beak for it too. Betsy. Over here. I could swear her voice came from right here. Obviously no-one is in the orchard. If you don't mind me saying so, it's what I call 'weird'. You don't think that our Betsy is ventriloqual and throwing her voice? She doesn't think enough of any of us to throw anything. Hello. Well, Betsy. What are you doing up there? I was thinking of building a nest until you came along. How long have you been there? Since before breakfast. I am so full of apples I feel like an overenthusiastic Eve. You don't like it up there, do you? No. I don't. I climbed up after an apple and I just can't figure out how to get down. We'll fix that. John, you take that limb there. Harry, you take that one. You'd look at home in a tree. Well, what has been going on in Washington? In congress incessantly. By the way, where are John and Henry? I must discuss something with them. They've gone to the orchard to look for Betsy. Looking for Betsy is rapidly becoming a great American pastime. Shall we join in? I'd like to see Betsy and I must see the senators. Alright. Keep your chin up, dear. I'll attend to the chin. You worry about the rest of me. Pay no attention to him, Betsy. John, you haven't the proper leverage. I must find them. I must get their reports. Dependable fellows, both of them? - Very. They are all business. Never permit themselves to lose dignity. Or appear ridiculous. Tut, tut, tut, tut. Will you wear this one, mon Capitaine? It looks like another banquet. And more indigestion. Well, there will be a banquet after the races. I object. I am sick of banquets and I'm sick of being like a goldfish in a bowl. I don't see why you complain. After all, you meet the best people. And they outdo themselves to honor you. What more could you wish? I could wish to wake up some morning and be a plain ordinary human being. To go out and do the things I want to do because I want to do them. To talk to people because I like them. To see people. Capitaine, hurry. We'll go and tell them you're coming. Why? They invited me, didn't they? - Yes. But you disappoint them so often. We feel it a courtesy to arrive before you and apologise for your tardiness. We can depend on you being there? I'll be there. The carriage will be waiting for you. You're quite sure he is coming? - Yes, Monsieur. His carriage should be here any moment. Monsieur Bonaparte has been delayed. He requires our assistance. We will return with him later. Isn't Hamlet looking terribly thin? Yes. And trained to win. See how he is muzzling. The poor dear is hungry. He's asking for a sugar bun. Maybe he would rather have pie? Sir Harry. Will you run along and get him a sugar bun? And John. Will you see if Captain Bonaparte has arrived. And I'll go and change my bet to Firefly. Run along. Ravenez. Tout de suite. Allons, enfants. Allons-y enfants. Araby. Continute .. [ Laughter ] Am I amusing you? No, mademoiselle. I wasn't laughing at you. You weren't? No. I was laughing at your French. What is wrong with it? The way it sounds, mostly. Really? I suppose you would like to teach me? I might if your disposition were better. If you aren't the most insolent .. Insolent .. - Pup? No. - Cad? No. - Bounder? That's it. Thank you. That's alright. Where is Betsy? Knowing Betsy, it wouldn't surprise me .. If she were riding this Jerome Bonaparte piggyback in the next race. You are making me miss the race. And Hamlet is running. If you don't mind me making a pun, Hamlet hasn't the ghost of a chance. Perhaps you would like to bet? Very much. I tell you what. If Hamlet wins, I'll be your stable boy for a week. If he loses. You spend the rest of the afternoon showing me the countryside. That is absurd. - You proposed a bet. Like all women, you .. - It's a bet. It's a bet. Oh, he lost. The poor darling. He lost. You. You pop up in the most unusual places. I couldn't see from down here. Who won? Firefly. How considerate of Firefly. We have to send him some sugar buns. Shall we commence our stroll? This section of the state of Maryland which you are now about to visit. Because my fool horse ran backwards. Has a wide diversity of crops. Which I shall tell you about at great length. Mademoiselle, you would love Paris. La Boire in the spring. Everything is new there. The wine, love, life. The flowers. Everything. You and I. He and she. They and them. Would walk along arm in arm. Listening to the laughter in the breeze. Then, mademoiselle. I am King of France. And the rest of the year? [ Singing in French ] I'd do a lot more than that if I were king. So would I. To begin, I'd pass a law that on every Tuesday everybody must go to a race. Firefly would be the only horse in it. - Why? To commemorate the nicest thing that ever happened to me. What would you do if you were queen? And you were king? I would abdicate. Remind me to have you beheaded. I refuse to lose my head. And your heart? Only for an afternoon. The afternoon is nearly gone. - Yes. And I must go. Stay a little longer. - It will be dark when I get home. It's your own fault for being so adorable. If I were a man I would thrash you. If you were a man it wouldn't have happened. This afternoon might have been fun. If you had been sportsman enough not to spoil it. But you did. So goodbye. Mademoiselle. Miss Betsy. What are you doing so far from home, you little rascal? Sitting on a rock. And tears, Pippin. Why? Cos I is lost. And it's getting dark. And I ain't so easy to find in the dark. Where have you been? - To the race. With one of your papa's mules. You have? Where is he? I done stubbed my toe on him. You stubbed your toe on a mule? Yes, ma'am. On his head. As I was passing over it. In other words, he threw you off and ran away. Is that it? I almost thought I was dead. That's what I wish. Dead and in heaven. Because mules don't go to heaven. Then there wouldn't be one missing. For me to be blamed for. Besides, it was not my fault. The mule just fell underneath me. That's all. Tell you what I'll do. I'll loan you that mule for the day. So you didn't run off with it at all. You borrowed it with my permission. Did I? You certainly did. Come on. We're both late. Miss Betsy. I is sure glad I belong to you. You don't belong to me. The only person in the world you belong to is your mammy. Please, Miss Betsy. Can I belong to you too? Alright. As long as you're good. - Then I is always gonna be good. Miss Betsy, honey. What you doing back here? I picked up a little something that belongs to you, Esther. Land sakes, Miss Betsy. Where did you find this little black imp of mischief? Shush. He's asleep. Yes, ma'am. And dirty too. Don't wake him up. He's all tired out. - Yes, ma'am. Good morning, my dear. - Good morning, father. Shall I ring for a julep or have you had breakfast? I had it in bed. Betsy. I've been thinking of what you said about your French being bad. So I have engaged a tutor for you. A Monsieur Giroux. When? - To start this morning. He teaches singing too. He's in the arbour, waiting until after breakfast. Well, I think I'll take a peep at him. - Now Betsy. Don't embarrass him. He impressed me as being rather shy. I never had a tutor that was not shy of something. The last one, it was here. The one before - teeth. But Betsy, don't you want me to .. Thank you. Oh. You. Bonjour, mademoiselle. - Are you my tutor? Just hired. - And fired. Mademoiselle, I must make a living. You'll have to do it elsewhere. - May I presume to ask why? No. You may not. You know why. After all, I was Betsy to you once on a hilltop. You took advantage of that. So I doubt very much whether you can be depended upon to remember .. That I am Miss Patterson. Your pupil. Do you really dislike me? Intensely. And you wish I would go? - Heartily. Very well. I will go. Monsieur Giroux. I .. I just happened to think. My father. Would be most disappointed I had discontinued my lessons. Yes. It does seem a pity. I am very fond of my father. I would rather do anything than disappoint him. Even to putting up with you. So, do you suppose that you could be quite impersonal .. If I let you continue as my tutor? Mademoiselle, I shall be like ice. Very well. Like ice. And I shan't tolerate a thaw. We shall start with the verbs, mademoiselle. I will pronounce them in French and you will translate. 'Je vous aime'. I .. I love you. Very good. 'Vous m'aime'. You. You love me. Quite correct. 'Nous nous aimons'. We .. We love each other. That's perfect. I .. I think that will be enough for today, Mr Giroux. We are progressing a little too rapidly. Yes. Au revoir, Mademoiselle. Au revoir, Monsieur. No, no, no. Au revoir. Oh. Au revoir. Tr?s bien. Danke schoen. [ French singing ] Do you realize Miss Betsy has been with that nightingale for three hours now? French teacher. Singing coach. Fencing master. If he ever takes up dressmaking, we're done. I don't like the fellow at all myself. He has that 'picked out of season' look. No manners. No .. no poise. As a matter of fact the man has no .. no liver. [ French singing ] Well, if you three insist on holding a wake around here. You had better get a corpse and do it right. Yes. With a little working-over that French tutor might do very nicely. Betsy has been seeing too much of this young nobody. Poppycock. He's doing her a lot of good. Whetting her thirst for knowledge. But did you wonder about what? Yes. About what? [ French singing ] Now you try it. [ French singing ] No, no. Have you no feelings? - I used to have. But I've been sitting here so long I'm getting numb. I don't think you know what the words mean. With the kind of French teacher I have. That does not surprise me. I'll sing it in English. Play. My kingdom for a kiss. I would gladly give you. My kingdom just for this. A kiss from you. A million skies are blue. And miles of moonlight. They would all belong to you. For a smile or two. You would have a crown for yourself made of stars and your pearls. To be made of the morning dew. Can I do more than this? My heart surrenders. A kingdom for a kiss. A kiss from you. That is lovely. That's one thing you and Napoleon have in common. That is his favorite piece. I am so glad. Because I believe I admire Napoleon more than any man in the world today. That's another thing you and Napoleon have in common. Betsy. You'd better pack. Because we're going to Washington. Yes. I forgot. Don't keep Aunt Ellen waiting because I don't think she's very fond of you. Fond of me? She said I was the only pain she'd ever had that Dr Beecham's salve can't cure. It is so silly. She suspects you of being in love with me. That is funny. I suspect that myself. How ridiculous. Ridiculous? It would be if I weren't. You have no right to talk that way. I have every right in the world because I adore you. I would do anything to make you happy. You forget you are my tutor. You're paid to teach. Not to make love to me. Stop being Miss Patterson of the Baltimore parish. Be yourself. Be Betsy. What's wrong with 'Miss Patterson' may I ask? Well, she is snobbish and dictatorial. Oh? So I am a snob, am I? A prig, am I? Well, do you know what you are? You are an ex-tutor. Fine. I didn't want the job anyway. Good. You haven't got it. - Very well. I resign. You are discharged. Here are your books. Not that you'll have any use for them. Oh yes I will. Miss Patterson. When Spain owned Louisiana we had nothing to fear. But now, in the hands of France. This offer of sale is a threat. Either we buy it or he is going to expand it. It is very easy to read between the lines. This Napoleon person is a definite menace to American freedom. I can overhear. I was on my way to my room. I could not help but overhear. Perhaps you could avoid overhearing more by proceeding on your way to your room. And leave the Honorable John Hathaway in a state of ignorance? Why not? That is the state he represents in the senate. Tut-tut. By what right do you insult my guests, Monsieur Giroux? By what right do your guests insult my ruler, Mr Patterson? I agree with them. Napoleon is a menace to the freedom of the United States. Napoleon wants a European empire. Not an American one. In offering Louisiana for sale to the United States. He is declaring his faith in the new republic. Believing it builds a great nation able to defend its shore against the world. Why, may I ask .. This unselfish friendship of Napoleon for the United States? It is not unselfish. He thinks that sometime France may might need America's friendship. He is willing to buy it with loyalty and support. For loyalty? Of Napoleon? The loyalty of a traitor and a liar. Undoubtedly, Mr Hathaway. You are willing to show the courage of your convictions with a rapier? You forget yourself, Monsieur Giroux. But not that I am a Frenchman. May I remind you that Mr Hathaway is a guest in this house. And you are a servant. Yes. That, I had forgotten. You will have no opportunity to forget it again. I am sorry, Mr Patterson. You leave at once. You mean I am discharged? - Yes. That's been happening to me all day. Au revoir, gentlemen. The effrontery of him. - Yes. Fortunately for him there were no rapiers handy. Or I'd have accepted his challenge and disposed of him. Sure. What could you do with a pair of rapiers? Knit himself a bed jacket. Senators, I want to apologise to you for that young puppy. Why should you? Come in. Captain Bonaparte. I suppose everyone in the house knows you're here and who I am. No, Captain. Your incognito has been preserved. We told the butler we were from the consulate. To inspect your papers. As a French citizen. Good. We regret, however, to bring news which must terminate your .. Idyllic interlude here. It's already been terminated. In two places. What is the message? It is from our ambassador. Tomorrow night there is a meeting of high officials. To consider the purchase of Louisiana. He has promised that the brother of Napoleon will be there. To assure them personally of the good faith of France. That's one thing I cannot avoid. [ Door knocks ] Come. In the closet. How can we do that? - Hang yourself on a hook. Or hang yourself. Come in. I have been sent. Who is discharging me now? Your Aunt Ellen or the cook? My father feels he has done you an injustice. And asks you to please accept your position back. Thank him very much. But tell him I already accepted the previous dismissal. About that one? Miss Patterson is still most annoyed. But Betsy would like to have you stay. Honest? Honest. And. I am sorry. Sorry for what? Sorry that you are .. That you are so very annoying. You'd better hurry up and pack. We leave for Washington in half an hour. I can't go. Can't go? But father apologized. - It isn't that. I know what it is. It's your silly pride. No, no. No it isn't. Then what? Perhaps you have a more interesting pupil? Of course not. It is .. Well, I can't tell you. Very well. I am not coaxing you. - Betsy. Betsy, you don't understand. - I understand. I have been cheap enough to beg you. And I'm sorry for that. It would have been much more courteous if you'd slapped my face. Mon Capitaine. - I thought I said to hang yourselves. We have another message for you. From Napoleon. As far as I'm concerned, Napoleon can go soak. So much for the territory of Louisiana. Sold. To the United States for eighty million francs. Do you realize, Consul, they are buying it at less than five cents an acre? Better to sell it to them than have them take it away from us later. Besides, I need that money to feed the cannons to defeat the English. You know, Cambaceres. It won't be long before Napoleon and England meet on some battlefield. Maybe. Austerlitz or .. Jena. Waterloo. But it will be the victory which crowns the First Consul Emperor of France .. And King of England. What else is news? - On the table, sir. I mean from America. No word from Jerome? Well? No. Not from him. Not directly. No harm has come to him? - No. Not harm. A mischief. That is. He has been living in the residence of one Charles Patterson. Disguised as a tutor teaching French and music to his daughter. Disguised? The young scamp. Disguised as a tutor, eh? The lucky young devil. No cares. No worries. No wars. Just French and music and love. You are not angry? Who am I to be angry about a harmless flirtation? I'd do a little tutoring myself if I could think of something to teach. Did I tell you about the time I disguised .. Some other time for that. I wrote a despatch to Pichon this morning. Yes, sir. You said .. I know what I said. Now add the following. You are to inform my brother Jerome he is to return at once to his duties. And in a more serious frame of mind. These bills. Nothing but bills and bills. On the receipt of the Louisiana purchase there are sure to be certain ceremonies. These he is to attend. And not as a tutor. But in his official capacity as my representative. What does Josephine mean by spending fifty thousand francs on one necklace? Oh well. That is what tutoring costs me. Immediately after, you return to France aboard a vessel placed at your disposal. You know, Cambaceres. I say there are three prerequisites to keeping a wife and winning a war. Money, money and money. Upon his arrival. He will prepare himself to wed the Princess Friederike of Wurttemberg. The negotiations for which union are now nearing a successful conclusion. Now get out. The lot of you. Wake me in fifteen minutes. - Yes, sir. You know. It strikes me .. That the Pattersons take this reception for young Bonaparte far too seriously. Yes. They hardly give a man a place to lay his weary .. Head. I haven't seen Betsy since she returned from Washington. Nor I. She has been a bit nunnish. Since she's got back, hasn't she? - Hasn't she. Betsy. Yes? What do you think has happened? I don't want to know. What has? Napoleon has been made emperor. Really? How nice for Napoleon. Betsy, what is the matter? I am quite well. - But not happy. Ever since we returned to Baltimore you've been wretched. Perhaps I miss Washington. Or that tutor? That tutor? You miss him? I hope I never lay eyes on him again. Darling, don't. - He's an impudent upstart. Betsy. A conceited nincompoop. Don't get so excited. - Not only that. He is a .. He is a .. He is .. He is the sweetest person and .. In the whole wide world. You love him, don't you? You don't think I could hate him this way if I didn't, do you? Maybe his going away was an act of providence, dear. You are a Patterson. And he .. a tutor. It wouldn't make any difference. Not to you perhaps. But to him it would. Right or wrong, people will think of him as a social climber and fortune hunter. That would make him miserable. Because of him being unhappy you would be too. I would be willing to risk it. - That wouldn't be unfair to him. It is better this way. Be grateful for memories. Believe an old spinster. But I'm not old, Aunt Ellen. I'm young. I don't want memories. I want life. You will find it. But not with him. No. Not with him. Mr Aaron Burr. Vice President of the United States. Mistress Burr. Mister and Mistress Alexander Hamilton. Monsieur Pichon. What do you suppose delayed Betsy? I'm afraid she is too concerned at the departure of one Frenchman .. To be interested in the arrival of another. Secretary and Mistress Gallatin. That tutor? Nonsense. A bare fiction. Exactly. And bare fiction describes cupid perfectly. Two lonely hearts. Divided but someday .. Those two hearts shall be as one. Two hungry hearts. That need one another .. As flowers need the sun. Two hearts that long for romance each night. Can stay apart too long. Two lonely hearts divided. Are singing love's old sweet song. Hello darling. How dare you. Because I love you. You shouldn't say things like that. - Shouldn't I? No. Not unless they are true. I've been crossing my heart ever since I met you. Why did you go away then? - So you'd find out if you missed me. Did you? - I knew I would miss you. All I found out was .. how much. Was it enough to .. Betsy, does it matter terribly that .. That I am only a tutor? Yes. It matters to my father, Aunt Ellen .. My friends and .. - And to you? Yes. Because you've taught me something I never want to forget. What's that? That it takes two people to keep the moon shined up. And the stars polished. And the wind in tune. And the world waltzing. It is too big an undertaking for me alone. They get dull. And flat and limpy. That means that .. Enough? To love at all .. is to love enough. Even to forgetting that you are Miss Betsy Patterson? And I am only Monsieur Giroux? That would be nice. - What? To being only Monsieur and Madame Giroux. I could cut quills for you and .. Mix your ink. Keep your papers straight. I must leave now. - No. Sorry, but I really must. When am I going to see you again? - Very, very soon. Excuse me, sir. But y'all can't go in there, Mr Giroux. Y'all just watch me, Zachariah. Captain Jerome Bonaparte. Monsieur Patterson I presume. Your face is rather familiar. Yes. So it seems to me. I mean, that is .. Confound it, Captain Bonaparte. I really don't know what to say. Permit me to collect my scattered wits. Then I'll introduce you to the people waiting to meet you. May I take advantage of that moment and see Betsy? Of course. Of course. - Thank you. Thank you. Captain Bonaparte. Betsy. So, you are not Mr Giroux. But Captain Bonaparte. Making Mrs Giroux .. More or less of a laughing stock. Darling, would you mind not being a little fool? Whether I sail in my brother's navy or teach you verbs you can't remember. Has nothing to do with the fact that I love you. If it didn't make any difference. Why didn't you tell me? - I suppose .. Because it was much more flattering to be loved as a tutor. Than as the brother of an emperor. Things are .. Rather reversed, aren't they. Not at all. I am still the luckiest man in the world. Tell me, Henry. Do really think that a drinking duel like this .. Is the best way to decide who has the privilege of proposing to Miss Betsy? Yes, I do. Absolutely. - May I have an opinion? I doubt it. Gentlemen, this drinking duel is no good to us. Because when the survivor has drunk the other two under the table. The aforementioned survivor will be so piffled .. He won't be able to propose to Betsy. You know, despite his broken English there's something in what he says. Is there really? But let us fight the duel. You mean, instead of drinking one? To the death? Yes. Even if it kills us. A Hathaway have never been afraid to look death right in the face. With a Hathaway face he shouldn't be. If I'll be killed I'd sooner it occurred tonight so I can have tomorrow off. I wish to express my gratitude. To one who, by his excellent advice and constant encouragement. Has made this achievement possible. Our host and compatriot. Mr Charles Patterson. I can only express my happiness. That soil which once flew the flag of France. Will hereafter fly the Stars and Stripes. But I am human enough to be even happier .. Over another alliance between France and the United States. One that will bring to France something far more precious. Than any territory. I wish to announce the betrothal .. Of my daughter Elisabeth to Captain Jerome Bonaparte. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. - I'm sure you'll be very happy. I know we will. - My dear. Isn't it marvelous, Aunt Ellen? Marvelous? It's incredible. He starts out as her tutor, suddenly becomes Napoleon's brother. And ends up as my nephew. Mon Capitaine. - Yes? May I speak with you? - Later. Now. Will you excuse me? - Of course. What is wrong? - A letter came from the emperor. We were foolish enough to refrain from imparting its contents to you. Not realizing the seriousness of the situation. You had better read it now. Jerome. Something's wrong. Yes. That letter? Yes. It is from Napoleon. Us? Do you love her? - I've never even seen her. Oh, Jerome. I was so frightened .. - But that was foolish. What are we going to do about it? It is very simple. We marry right here in Baltimore. The emperor commands. But in this instance will not be obeyed. What will his disobedience mean? Two things, mademoiselle. Disownment and disgrace. I won't let you do this. I won't let you be humiliated in front of all these people. And I won't give you up. Of course you won't. We'll go to France together. And be married there. But Mademoiselle. His Imperial Majesty orders Captain Bonaparte to return .. Unaccompanied. You may inform his Imperial Majesty that I won't return at all. You must go. But I shan't let you go alone. Betsy. You don't know Napoleon. I know the great Napoleon couldn't be petty enough to deny what is so right. I am not afraid, Jerome. [ Door knocks ] Betsy, what's the matter? - The matter? Nothing. Why? The people are wondering. Mr Patterson. We have received a letter from the emperor. Let me have the letter please. Mr friends. A letter just came from Napoleon. I know you would like to hear it. It is written in French. So, should I stumble a little in the translation .. You must forgive me. 'My dear brother Jerome'. 'I have received your letter in which you tell me ..' 'That you have fallen in love with ..' 'An American girl'. 'I wish you success'. 'Your mother is especially anxious to meet the girl that her son loves'. 'If you can persuade your sweetheart ..' 'To be married in France'. 'That would please us all very much'. 'Paris'. 'Is a fine setting for a wedding'. 'Your loving brother'. 'Napoleon'. Knowing his admiration for courage. I think Napoleon would have awarded her the L?gion d'honneur for that. Alone? Where's Aunt Ellen? She's in her cabin. I did not dream your country would be like this. So cold. And forbidding. - The fog? We arranged it on purpose. The unveiling comes in a few hours. The sun will attend to that. But Jerome. Will everything be alright? I felt so brave. Now, all of a sudden. I am afraid. Of him. - Napoleon? Why? He is so powerful. Not half so powerful as you are lovely. Come into my cabin where it's warm and dry. Alright. To our love story. That started once upon a time as Monsieur and Madame Jerome. And ends with Jerome and Betsy .. Living happily ever after. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? It is I, Cambaceres. That's my brother's second consul. Come in. Monsieur Le Consul. Captain Bonaparte. I can best explain my presence. By reading the orders I received from the emperor regarding you. 'Captain Bonaparte is commanded to leave the frigate herein'. 'And accompany our envoy without delay or question'. 'Leaving on board the young woman with whom he has associated himself'. That's enough, Cambaceres. Perhaps you had better listen to the consequences of your disobedience. It will be, that Miss Patterson. Whom my brother discourteously refers to as 'the young woman'. And I will return to America. - But the emperor? To the devil with the emperor. - A pleasant crossing, Jerome. In view of my brother's oversight, mademoiselle. Allow me to present myself. I am the Emperor of France. Perhaps mademoiselle will permit me a little chat with her alone. Have your little chat with me, Napoleon. It will save you trouble and Miss Patterson embarrassment. There is no more necessity for trouble or embarrassment. That is for dramatics. Jerome. Put your cloak on. It's chilly out. I shan't leave her alone to be browbeaten by you. I have ordered you from this cabin, Captain Bonaparte. Now go. I am sorry but .. - Please, Jerome. There is nothing to be afraid of. Please, mademoiselle. Mademoiselle. There are times when to do the right thing is to do the cruel thing. That must be my plea for your forgiveness. I'm sure you will never need my pardon, Your Majesty. You are generous. Not at all. It is you who must be generous. For in this instance. The right thing. Is the kinder thing. You do not understand. I have come .. To ask me to give up Jerome. The wrong thing. So wrong that I shan't permit it. You shan't permit it? Your ego transcends you, mademoiselle. You forget I am his emperor. And I, the woman he loves. Yes. And you love Jerome Bonaparte. But you forget I can deprive him of his name. His commission. And leave your glamorous Captain Bonaparte just a destitute nobody. You seem very certain that he will choose a throne in preference to me. Could any man do otherwise? There's only one way to answer that. And that is? By asking him to make that choice. Now. Mademoiselle. Perhaps there is a more subtle way of determining. One less embarrassing to all of us. There can be no subtlety to either Yes or No, Your Majesty. You win, mademoiselle. I was merely testing you and you detected it. I know as well as you that Jerome's choice could not be flattering to me. May I? Please. To your victory. Ironic, isn't it? That the two people who want his happiness the most .. Should cheat him of it. He'll find happiness with me. I know. Now perhaps. But will he love you when you have made him an exile from his family? A poverty-pinched tutor. An outcast from his country. What could this other woman bring him that I could not? Can you bring him an army? Can you bring him an alliance with a powerful country? Those are for you, not him. No. Not for him. Not for me. But for France. His country and mine. Which depended on him to make this alliance with Wurttemberg. To create a wall against which France was to put her back. And fight for her existence as an empire. Forgive me. My love of my country carries me away. France means everything to you, doesn't it? Everything. It is my life. France has many great statesmen. Generals and artists. But only one emperor. I, Napoleon. Fate did not make me that. Nor opportunity. Nor my ambition. France made me that. Because her people needed a man of the hour. And entrusted that brief hour to me. If I fail, France fails. If I succeed. France succeeds. But whether I fail or succeed. Live or die. I, Napoleon, matter no more than the meanest private in my ranks. All that matters and endures .. Is France. The devil that appeared when you entered, Your Majesty. Has vanished. And in his stead? I see a great patriot. But after all. What is a patriot? First. A dreamer. An unselfish dreamer. Then. An idealist. A man of action. Well. A man to be admired. And you want to deprive Jerome of his dream? You want to barter his ideals for your happiness? To tether his vigour, his initiative, his force? Change him from a patriot into a traitor? Admire him? Who can admire a man like that? I can. - You and you alone. The world will despise him. For a man who slunk away like a cheap boulevardier. Finds solace for his weakness in a woman's arms. And day by day. Year by year, he will have his self-respect eaten away. By the knowledge that he has betrayed the millions of people that are France. He will learn to hate himself. To hate you. You are the victor now perhaps. But you have defeated your own future happiness. A nation goes on forever. An emperor lives in history. But Jerome and I .. We live for such a little while. We are entitled to that. Go on. Take your moment of happiness. It won't be worth what it costs either of you. But I love him. - That is a lie. You dare say I lie? I'd die for him. - To die for him is easy. To live without him is hard. But it is bravery. It is sacrifice. It is love. I. I .. I .. all you speak of is 'I'. What of him? Let him go. He'll be miserable without me. He will be miserable without his self-respect. It's my life. - It is his. How can you ask this? - I'm not asking. I am begging. Begging. Understand? You? The great Napoleon. Begging me? I love him. And I love him too. I will give him up. Mademoiselle. I have faced death on the battlefield. I have gambled my career across a table. But before for you, I feel a coward. I can't tell him. There's no necessity to. A ship is anchored in the harbor waiting to sail for America tonight. Your aunt is already aboard. You were very sure of yourself. Monsieur L'Emperor. No. Only certain that any woman who Jerome could love. Would be a gallant lady. I. I must see him before I go. I will send him to you. You will hear four bells when the boat is ready. He must not know. No. He will never know. She wants to see you. Success? Strategy? Dramaturgy. An amazingly good actor met an amazingly receptive audience. Darling, what ..? - What? What indeed. I love you. - My dear. What did Napoleon say? It's all been settled. You mean he agreed to our marriage? There is nothing to worry about. Any more. Here. To. To tomorrow. Our wedding day. To. Tomorrow. It's gone flat. [ Four bells ringing ] Yes. It's gone flat. What's the matter, Betsy? The matter? Nothing. Jerome. Tomorrow is so far away. Humor me. Tell me how much you love me. So much that it's forever. No-one could ever take my place? Could she? - No-one, darling. No-one. I. I must go. - Go? Yes. I want to show you my wedding dress. But I can see it tomorrow. I .. I can't wait until tomorrow. Quickly. - Everything is ready. Mademoiselle. An emperor is grateful. He need not be. It was done. For a tutor. Betsy, dear. It's so good to see you back. It's good to be back, dad. One, two, three. You are all here. I was hoping you would be. For you. How lovely. You dear old grouch. From me. Have you been taking care of your liver? - Like a baby. Fine. And from me. My, how tall you have grown. You've ruined two lives completely. You use big words for a small matter. Other words can be used, Napoleon. Words like 'lie', 'cheat', 'deceive'. Go ahead. Use them. If it relieves your stupidity. But remember, they're merely useless words to you. To me, they were a means to an end. My end. Yes. Your end. By trickery. Trickery implies deception. I haven't deceived you since I succeeded in getting you away from your .. Shall we say, 'American' love? Boys, boys, boys. Well, Napoleon. I can see by the color of your face that you have got yourself in state. How are you, Jerome? What do you hear from your fianc?e? - He has no fianc?e. Must we always have this wrangling? - Yes. I'll wrangle him into becoming a figure in history. A power. I'll make him King of Westphalia. What good is that if he doesn't want it? What good is all this we have if it doesn't make any of us content? Perhaps he doesn't want to be a great man like you, Napoleon. Perhaps he wants only to be happy. Heavens. How little you understand. Yes. I am only your mother. When you were a little boy playing with tin soldiers in the vineyards. I never dreamed it would all come to this. I wanted you to be a great man. But I didn't want you to be so great that you weren't human. Even when you were young, Napoleon. I thought you were a little inclined to overestimate yourself. Come, my sons. It cannot be worth all this bitterness. Let him have his own life to do with as he pleases. For my sake. We followed you. Of course, we'll go away if you wish it. I just ran away from the others. Not from you. Betsy, would you .. That is .. may I .. We. May we offer a suggestion? - Of course you may. We think that perhaps it is high time that you choose .. Well, that you marry one of us. But you need not choose immediately. Say, within a day or two. Now Betsy, be careful of your choice. You have two out of three chances of making a gruesome mistake. But it is not. It's impossible. It is not a fair bargain. I gain one husband and lose three friends. Oh no. Besides. I love you all with a very special, warm kind of love. So I couldn't marry any one of you. Not even now? Especially not now. Why not, Betsy? It's all over. You can't go on living in the past. We had so little in the past. Everything was in the future. Yes. But you are young. You will soon forget. Forget? How can I forget? When everything I see and hear reminds me of him. I am sorry. A million skies are blue. And miles of moonlight. They would all belong to you. For a smile or two. You'd have a crown for yourself made of stars and of pearls. All would be made of the morning dew. Jerome. Jerome. Betsy. Betsy, where are you? I am here. Go to the gate. Hurry. Hurry. My dear. They have both come true. Who? Mister and Mrs .. Giroux. ..w-g..
