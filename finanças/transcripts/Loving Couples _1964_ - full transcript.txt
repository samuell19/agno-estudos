LOVING COUPLES Angela... Remember it's our child. Welcome, Angela. Don't look so tragic, Petra. You're not the father! Everything will be fine and no complaints, eh? Not if you keep your word. My word? To let me stay awake. I want to know what's happening. - You're waiting? - Yes. Well, I've a lot to do before I bring this child into the world. These corridors are like prison. The women are let out, but for us it's a life sentence. Don't worry. We'll take good care of her. I'll see your wife now. I'll wait here. Good morning. Good morning. Mrs Holmstr?m. Next, please. I can't do much unless you take your pants off and lie down. I believe it's dead. We'll admit you and see. Nurse. Admit Mrs Holmstr?m for an operation. Thank you. Never mind the money. Miss von Pahlen has seen to that. Mrs Holmstr?m... Good news foryou. It's dead. No... What else did you expect? Ad?le... Please... leave me alone. I must stay in any case. Where is my child tonight? Oh, where is my child tonight? Come back, don't forget That I love you yet... Like a sweetie? No, thanks. There's motherly love foryou. Ljump about for days on end to get the brat out, but I expect he's too comfy where he is. He needs a smack on the bottom, if he has a bottom! Won't you have a sweetie? Don't, then. ...like a lot of broody hens and one must be everything to them. Even theirfriend but that's a bit much. Off you go now, my dear. Where's my wandering child tonight? The child I long have sought Who made me oh so glad and bright Whom I still loved, I thought. Where is my child tonight? Fresh air. Freedom. We're tied to them with an umbilical cord! - It's not easy to cut. - You're dependent on women. Good Lord, no! But they can use the cord to feed our vanity and strangle our independence. Beware of women, Sam. They serve one purpose, anyway. 30 seconds of heaven for 30 years of hell. "Can't you stop the church bells? They keep me awake all night." - Yes, they want us to play God. - And don't we? Now that we commit ourfriend to the Grace of the Almighty, he surely wants us to think of the little daughter he leaves. And this in such a way that, filled with tenderness, we try to find what we are best suited to do for her and generously open our hearts and homes to her and care for her to the utmost of our ability each of us taking our share of the responsibility forthis little girl's development into a woman thinking not only of this life but of her immortal soul helping to give her strength to endure the trials of this life so that she may choose the right path, the path of duty. Everything all right? A pleasant change for me... I mean, being in the country. I have quite enough to do as it is. One's own children come first. I'm sure the family can manage without trouble to either party. The family should meet a little more often. A very risky suggestion. Come along. Would you like some cake? No pampering, ladies. She has to learn that life is not a game. - Wise words. - We're a wise family, vicar. We don't hold with feelings: They're too vulgar. Ring if you want anything. I bet that... Petra keeps this excellent brandy in the medicine cabinet! - Sacrilege! - And now to business. Welcome, everyone. Vicar, would you? Almighty God, we humbly beseech Thee to bless our deliberation and to let us partake of Thy wisdom and of true Christian love. I'd like to thank our lawyer, Gr?ndahl, for his work. All that remains is to decide what's to be done with the girl. - A guardian won't be out of pocket. - Indeed not. - Jacob's our expert on children. - Not at home. A child in my house would be like the vicarfinding the bishop in bed. Very funny. Have you spoken to the ladies, Mr von Pahlen? Of course not. They might think the girl's best comes first. Miss Petra lives all alone here in this big house. - Very interesting, vicar. - A brainwave! Need we put it to the vote? Splendid. That's settled, then. Gentlemen. Cheers! Excuse me... If you're discussing Angela, I'll take her. Why didn't you say so? I didn't want to be selfish. A man's duty is to brave the cruel world and battle for his family. And now, on your 18th birthday, dear Angela, we come to you. At last! Now that you're grown up, you're free. No more spankings. We all value freedom. None more than I. Your next big step in life will be when you enter holy wedlock. Still more freedom! We all hope you will fall for someone the family can be proud of. It's a rule in this family. There are some things we don't approve of. Quarrels... Divorce... Bad temper... - Honesty and truth. - Rudeness to servants... "Honesty and truth," I said. Your health, Papa. I haven't finished. Oh, the bit about Angela being sent to boarding school to learn womanly virtues. So, here's to freedom! Two inseparables! Angela and Stanny, the loving couple! - Where's Caesar, Miss Fredrika? - The naughty little dog. - Gone again? - He's too fond of the girls! - I think Caesar's in love! - Let us sing Hymn 64. Unbridled now are passions aflame Brazen sins are begotten The world has abandoned all modesty and shame God is insulted and forgotten Christians everywhere loudly complain of all the wicked examples God, take pity on all the pain Hear the laments from Thy temples Let us pray. Dear Lord, keep our souls pure this night and for evermore. Amen. Girls, to your rooms at once. And no noise and romping. One more verse, Henrika. Caesar! Stop it! Caesar! Hurry up, Stanny! Angela, you've no time to swim. Cool off here instead. Turn around. You're fond of Stanny? Good. One needs a best friend. Someone to confide in. But you're shivering, my sweet! Such a tiny hand. Stanny's are so big and coarse. Real navvy's hands. Now I've hurt you. I didn't mean to. I was hurt deeply as child. That's why you girls mean so much to me. I was very lonely, a foster child. And very unhappy. They must be hereabouts. Hurry! Angela! Stanny! Where is she? Angela! Help! Help! Did the doctor wear rubber gloves? Probably not. He's like that. The test confirmed a dead foetus. Bad luck. A dead baby's harder to give birth to. Ad?le! Sit still. - What an excellent maid. - Yes, she is. - I'm quite envious. - I was lucky. Ad?le, the sugar. - How is your husband? - He's due home soon. - A capital fellow. - Yes, I was lucky. Men always let you down. Just knock at people's doors and you'll get money forthe sweets. Now do as I tell you! I don't want to. Here she comes! I don't want to! - What's this? - Sweets. They look nice. I quite envy you, girl, having all these sweets to yourself. Mind you don't get a tummy-ache. Don't talk to me about kids. I've had five. One died inside me. Strangled, I think. Another just popped out as I was scrubbing the floor. Daniel! Time to get you ready now. Men always let you down. Not me. Why not? - Because I love you. - All men do. - He let me down. - Who? I'd bettertell you, now that we're married. Tell me what? What is it? I want you to know the truth... but you might not want to hear it. You're not the first. I knew it. It's the only thing you men care about. Being the first. His name was Daniel. He was in love with me. He was young and handsome and rich. He was something you can never be. You must help me. Help me! I love you! I love you! I love you! Don't go. I couldn't if I wanted to. They're not quite ready for us yet. Stop poking your nose into everything! Out you get! No! No! Where on earth are you going? For a walk. Women are not only fat-bellied, they're fat-headed as well. Oh, do help me. I'd spank you if it'd do any good or give me any pleasure. - Be kind to me. - I'll march you straight to bed. I want the grandest flat in town. Do you hear, Per? - Do you hear? - Yes... With velvet curtains. Red velvet curtains. Curtains... - And a chandelier. - Too expensive. All right... And small gilt chairs. Perhaps. Promise. Yes. Then I want a gramophone. Yes. And silver, real silverto eat off. Come on, don't be silly. Promise me the silver. Oh, hell and damnation! If he's deserted you, he can always be made to pay. He has wronged you, hasn't he? Perhaps you're even expecting? Well, then the law is on our side. A possible miscarriage later is beside the point. Justice shall be done. That's settled, then. It only remains to discuss the details at our leisure... - This evening, perhaps? - This evening. This isn't what you think. It's an examination. - Don't leave me alone. - You won't be alone much longer. - I want company. - You'll get it but of your own age. You'll soon have to be our guest: You're missing your station. Angela! - Did you meet... - I met him on the train. Isn't he famous? I've seen his picture in the papers. He... Why am I talking about him? I want to talk about you and me. These are foryou. Oh, there's so much to be done! - This world's not up to much. - It never will be. I see I'll have to change you first. You're so sad. No. I'm quite content in a melancholy kind of way. Wait! Wait a minute! - As usual, my husband's not here. - Ride with us, then. - I wrote and said I'd come today. - Don't get upset. Wait till you're married. You can't trust anyone. I'll only trust myself. Welcome home, Miss Angela. - Why didn't you tell me? - You knew I was coming today. Perhaps the letter's late. I was at the station, so it doesn't matter. Yes, it does. A little truth wouldn't hurt. For a change. I'll take it myself. Home! Women always say love's all that matters. It isn't it, is it, Petra? I refuse to talk of love. Or think of love. Life's too long to be spent being unhappy. Good night, Angela. Let's always be like this, Petra. Just you and me. I love you. I love you. I mean it, Petra! Marriage... It's like falling asleep for the rest of your life. I shall never marry. He's a bit touched. Perhaps all men are. What are men? I've forgotten! You can ride with us! The three things I need most as an artist: My model, my mother and this old hag: She can't hear! - Gosh, it's hot. - It won't last. My model gives me inspiration. My mother gives me complexes. And the old hag I flirt with for self-torment. Happy Midsummer! And she gives me money. - You're immoral! - You flatter me. - The country smells of cows. - Silly girl! Here we are, ladies! Stellan, it does smell of cows. - Afteryou, Alexandra. - Why should I always go first? Who's that? Ad?le. Married, therefore unhappy. There's no bearing you these days. I bet you're secretly in love! Am I the lucky man? - Can I help with the luggage? - Yes, with this huge old thing. She can't carry Aunt Alexandra! - All here for Midsummer. - We've been invited to a mansion. - Not the servants, surely? - No one can stop me from going. - Are there no big strong men? - Here I am, Agda! - Why not come more often? - You know you're only being polite. - Remember who I'm married to. - I treat everyone alike. Because she has no feelings. I love women. Even you, Angela! Though you're not a woman yet. No, not yet. - You'll ruin your shoes, Miss. - How thoughtful. - I bet you can look afteryourself. - Not always. - Much work left, Tord? - Just a goodnight to the animals. I hope they appreciate it. They have no feelings. They might not show it. But you have feelings. That's what matters. Yes, I have. Petra! Go away! Help me, Stellan. So many dresses and so few ideas. - Knock before visiting a lady! - A lady?! - You treat me like a... - Like a what? You can't treat women like humans. I'm not a human, I'm a servant. Tonight I'm a wizard and I'm here... to transform you into a goddess. I want to be myself. Nothing here... Nothing there... Hocus pocus! Come on. Every woman wants to be a goddess. The minute they're only women they die of boredom. Thank you. Come and sit down. Sit here. One little leg... The other one. Can I put the dress on now? Charming! May I have the pleasure? - I'm a goddess! - You're a servant girl! We do ourfighting at home, not on the battlefield. Anything but war! You want our soldiers to sit at home lapping milk like castrated tomcats! There is other work. - The quack's! - The gravedigger's. Must we speak of horrors? We men must. That's how quarrels start. Happy Midsummer, Petra. Come on, girls! You girls can ride in my car. You have to make do with what you have in life. I don't want to! I'm as good as they are. It's Midsummerfor us, too. Cheers. My darling. My poor darling... May I bid you welcome before we join the ladies. May I suggest a toast to our common interests? With warthreatening, the market is good. In my line there's never a slump. It's a popular investment. It's no joking matter. If you can't joke about that, you're in danger of taking women seriously. Never do that. Has everyone got champagne? Cheers! Welcome to Midsummer, the only time we can behave as we really want to. A charming speech, my dear. But that's my task, not yours. If I waited foryou to get going, I'd have dried up like a prune long ago. Stanny... Don't just sit with yourfriend. Help entertain the other guests. - Mama is jealous. - Of whom? - Of us. - Don't let hertreat you that way. You said yourself, one must fight to become a real person. - I'm not strong enough. - Everyone is! Angela! Angela! I found you! Come and say hello to Papa. What a charming little place. It's haunted too but perhaps you don't believe in ghosts? - Why haven't you been to see us? - I have to be invited first. Cecil doesn't quite understand. I avoided teaching him conventions. They are silly. They might have a purpose. - They provide a little protection. - We've talked of you a lot. - Your name has cropped up. - This is Aunt Petra. Papa said you looked alike but you don't at all. Let's go and look round. The aim of marriage, as with war, is to teach people how to hate each other. So solemn you look. Idealists, no doubt, who still believe in right and wrong. But things aren't black or white. Mix them and you get a dismal grey, which is more realistic. I hope my son Bernhard comes. He's my only comfort, apart from Stanny, of course, in this miserable world. You surely have many otherthings to make you happy. There's nothing like stimulus. It makes even one's most depraved wishes seem innocent. One forgets convention. One forgets one's age. Would you like to see me intoxicated? I have already. It's not the champagne. It's youth. Oh, there's Bernhard. Hello, my darling son. I think we've met before. Have we? Or I mistook you for someone else. Mama has so many friends. Run away and play. - Is it me orthe uniform? - Neither. Champagne? With pleasure, but not from the bottle. The noise you hear comes from our private zoo. I've promised the animals a visit: Part of the Midsummertradition. - Quack! - Warmonger! - It's haunted here. I feel it. - Nonsense, Alexandra. - Lost souls. - Especially on Midsummer's Eve. - It's an honorto escort you. - You're in luck, young man. I won't excuse myself. People never mean it anyway. But let me explain. I married a woman who helped me in my work. One must accept that. - I did but it took a long time. - A very long time? Yes. Many years. You women scare the life out of us. You're bent on giving us everything. Sooner or later we must hurt you. In your heart, you know it. Perhaps you even want it. - I loved you, Thomas. - Don't say that. - Scared? - You mean you still do? This male vanity! Men think their old flames can't forget them. - Can they? - I can, anyway. I've discovered a girl, perhaps a thousand years old. Preserved in a peat bog. Herface as lovely as ever. She haunts me. I wish I knew what she was thinking. It's not hard to guess. If I were romantic, I'd say "love". In which case she died before she found it. Many do. No one told herthat time is short. Angela, don't forget! - Don't forget what? - To behave. As I said, time is short. One must treasure it. When I see how people waste it, I think of the girl who longed for love but didn't dare. - Women are like that. - No, girls are. Women are braver. Social life is awful. I'm too old to have fun, too young to decline. - We should have asked herto stay. - Yes, but I'm too selfish. We women mustn't be selfish. We fight to stand on our own feet until a man comes and ruins it all. I lie awake thinking of that girl. She's so lonely, almost a child. There's little one can do alone. Except die. Do you always talk in riddles? I like people to be direct. I like people to stop reasoning. Feel, for God's sake! It's high time you joined us grown-ups! How are you, Jacob? You never say unless I ask. As usual. Macson ignores my friendship with his wife and borrows money from me. I'm the seducer. He's the pimp. I ought to push him off the train. Female logic! Yes, it's an infectious disease. - And your wife? - An accomplice, through her silence. Female logic again! Well, I'm damned. I think we need Dutch courage. What came over me? I feel so funny. - Good. - I don't usually do this. - Servants don't get much chance. - Cheeky! - I must get back. - I have to rest. Sit down. What are you giggling at? I don't know. - Are you going to be nice to me? - How? - We must celebrate Midsummer. - You're getting cheeky. You like it. Take your dress off. When it's so new and pretty? Do you know what it cost? I can guess. Five... Ten? - Fifteen... Twenty... - That's enough. For me? Careful! Mind my dress! Supper, damn it! - You forgot your hanky. - Have it as a keepsake. - But the money, then? - Keep it. Look who we have here! Agda! Come down and sing to us. Music has nothing to do with class. Sing, Agda! So she can sing? Quite well. Good night, my sweet. Sing us something nice, then. Jesus is my bridegroom dear I am yours Thee alone my heart is near I am yours I do now the world disdain What's that? To buy a new dress with, sister. You can't get a dress forthat. Then buy a new collarforthe dog. Mama hates him, you know. She hates everything I love. Except me. A conspiracy? You're not alone! Once I went to a fancy-dress ball as a flower girl. I went into a flower shop and the first thing I saw was Agda's bosom! And you know how I love fruit. Enforced intimacy improves no one. Can anything improve a person? What's that underthe table? One of Mr Landborg's ghosts! - If you're selling ghosts, I'll buy! - You can have one for nothing. Atoast to all ghosts! Living and dead. It's only Stanny's dog! "The best thing about a man is his dog." Your precious pet's a bother again. To all dog-haters! Dogs are too human to be worth any love. I agree! To all dog-haters! Delicious! Come closer so I can reach. Delicious. Quite delicious. You're here to enjoy yourself. Try to be like the others. It looks so easy to be womanly and weak. But I can't. The day will come when you're all alone and bored like us. I want to be old. I've been young too long and nothing's happened. You've been lucky. - Am I disturbing you? - Terribly That awful supper! I wanted to be with you. I saw you go. - They won't approve. - Be brave, you said. - You'll regret it. - Feel, you said too. - An apt pupil. - A good teacher. - Ateacherthat shouldn't lecture. - But that's why I'm here. He should say he has a wife in a mental home, a small son and a nasty habit of disappearing when things get hot. All the traits of a careless seducer. And whose fault is it? Yours. You're a troublesome girl. For 18 years they've told me I'm like them. I want a new teacher. I don't care if you are a seducer. Yes, I look forward to death. That can change my views on life. - Very funny. - No, very serious. Our school system has turned out some weird specimens of manhood. - Men have so much to talk about. - Anyway, we don't want them here. - Don't we, darling? - Men's talk is as dull as women's. Stellan, be an angel and get my feather boa from my room. - Which room? - My bedroom. How dull the boy is! My feather boa. In my bedroom. Mother, he doesn't know your room. Yet. We boys got a hiding every day. Very good for us! Then we'll tell him. - It's the second on the right. - On the right... Not left. Papa sleeps there. Ortries to. - On the first floor. - Try the second, the maids' rooms. Were you not an officer and a nitwit that remark might sound coarse. Stellan, the feather boa is on the bed. A great big bed with room for a whole regiment. ...a policy that will humiliate our country! Does that matter? In any civilized country... What are we waiting for? Oh, of course: Sunrise... You've muddled the poor boy. He'll look in the room on the left your papa shares with the maids. I'll go and help him. It suits you. Yes, doesn't it? Pretty boy. If I were you, I'd fall madly in love with myself. It's an enormous problem for me. When I propose to myself, I can never make up my mind. Say yes. I'm sure you'd be very happy together. But supposing I were unfaithful? What if you caught yourself at it? That's interesting! I'd see myself through the keyhole, mad with desire! Which knee am I sitting on? His or hers? - Choose. - Both. I like mixtures. Champagne alone is so boring. Add a dash of brandy and a pinch of sugar and what do you get? Me! But I'd have to taste it before I give an opinion. Don't take it off: It's part of me. You can't be just you. I never am. With your waist, I'd never worry. Yes, you would. It's put me in bed with odd people. Was it your waist they were after? - My prisoner! - Even prisoners can have fun. Someone's coming! Scared? Well, we've plenty of time. - How long are you staying? - Not long. - My painting stuff is in Stockholm. - Can't you go and get it? - If I had the money. - Loose change for my errand boys. If they're good and do their duty. - You've killed her. Murderer! - Quiet! It's only a dog. Stop this noise! The guests can hear. - The dog bit me. - Let me see. I'll get blood poisoning! Don't spoil a good scene with needless chatter. Champagne on the terrace, sir. - I hate her! - Hate can be enjoyable. It's so close to love but much more exciting. Hold me tight, Bernhard. You'll never grow up if you believe in family love. Not even yours? - Find someone else. - Who? Look. Sunrise. Right! Lt'll be years before we have such a peaceful Midsummer again! I know what you want to tell me but you think I'll be hurt. I loved Thomas once. He left me. It's fifteen years ago. Anyone you like, Angela, but not him. Not him. - Just a few flowers. - They're always welcome. Did you see the sunrise? - Yes. And you? - Alone. One is never alone then. No. God is with us. I wonder if God is with us. Is it because of Thomas that you never wanted... No. Of course not. It's because I'm a woman. A man does as he likes or what he thinks he should do. - I don't complain. - Why not? Thomas! Thomas! - Idiot. - Tyrant. Don't do that again. I'm just finding out how complicated happiness is. - Happiness is only a part. - You said it's everything. One for every week we've been together. I thought lovers forgot time and space. War! It's war, father! Come here, Cecil. Don't be silly. - War! War! - Quiet, you're scaring Angela. She's not afraid. She'll help us. We're going to war, aren't we? We'll see. He won't be back. But he'll write and I must go to him. It's war. He's at war with himself, you, anyone who gets in his way. - He won't marry you. - I'm carrying his child. - Are you sure? - Jacob has examined me. - Does anyone else know? - I have to tell him. - It's his child, too. - No, it's yours. Yours alone. Now you must only think of yourself and your child. Our child. Our child? Do you want it too? You do look happy. Has something happened? What do you say to this? - I don't know what to think. - Oh no, it's not me. Know where I found it? Up in the big house, where it's all so respectable and nice. That's right. In Angela's room. All the years we've respected them. But I saw what the girls were like. Petra, with her airs and graces, knows nothing. I'll tell her! And anyone else who'll listen. I'll pay them back for all my years with theirfilthy farm-hand! Nice to see you again. - Very nice. - So far, at least. - Hardly a suitable dress. - Sewing cheers me up. - Betterthink of the baby. - Why? He doesn't think of me. - You've nothing to put on him. - He won't go to parties for a bit. - Is there a mirror in the house? - In the gallery. How much longer? Don't know. He'll just pop out some day and say "Here I am!" He'll have a sense of humor. I wonder if mine will? - Yours? - Yes. My child. My artist. My explorer. My girl. I'd prefer a girl. We can share my baby clothes. I've made fartoo many. Agda! Come and sit for me. If you must, bring the kid too. I have to work. Now, now, now. Gently, gently. You're a mother-to-be, not a little girl. I've just had a talk with your interesting friend. I'll see that he does the decent thing. Although I can't see why I care... about someone who can't watch a sunrise without losing her pants. Sit still, Agda, or I'll get angry. Don't shout at me. I'm a goddess with a message from Heaven. Goddesses don't have revolting kids in theirtummies. Want to know a secret? That Angela has a bun in the oven? - Could I have a word in private? - Why in private? So that she doesn't... She won't hear or understand. Are you herfianc?? You've got the wrong person. - This is ridiculous. - And enormously amusing. Go on. I'm bothered with regard to the injured party I cannot marry. Sit still! Oh, why? Afamily arrangement. Financial. Anyway, she's a dashed pretty girl. So I have a proposal: A life annuity of 10,000 crowns. Most tempting. What am I supposed to do in return? Don't butt in, Agda! Merely marry her. Mama's servant?! She's your model. The answer's still no. How much did you say? 10... perhaps 15,000. - I accept. - Really? Why not? She's a dashed pretty girl! Agda, we're getting married! Wrong person again! This is madly exciting. Where's the parson? Typical! God always turns up late. This is a serious rehearsal. Don't be your usual stupid self. Then I'll be the usual stupid priest. Dearfriends, welcome to God's house! A very unusual wedding. It's also very unusual to keep one's hat on in church. - I had to see the happy bride. - I'm not married yet. It's ages since I got a proper kiss. I don't think I'll get married. Oh yes, you will. Calm down, Agda. At least until afterthe wedding. Watch carefully, my dears. Small, dainty steps... An entire Christian congregation has its eyes on you. - I'll be me! - Of course. This is the most important moment of your lives. Even if you've led a fast life with other men and women. - Not me. - Silly of you. Even if you intend being unfaithful as often as possible. Not me. The bride's not only silly. She's a liar. Just promise, in the presence of someone you don't believe in... - Oh, but I believe. - What? - I believe. - In what? In God. That's just your bad conscience. So just promise to love one another for better or worse till death, or something equally attractive, do you part. That's that. Not too painful. The ring! I recognize that. I don't think Gustav would mind. He gave it to both of us. Bernhard? Bernhard! - What are you doing? - Celebrating my freedom. They say everything's different when you're married. I feel the same. The reason we got married was to get what you've already had! Did you hearthe baby crying in church? It means bad luck. Bernhard, my husband refuses to give me any more champagne. - What you said sounds awful. - He insisted on marrying her. Noble of him. If only other members of the family were half as decent. When is the happy event? At the same time, if we're lucky. A sentimental little family party. Odd to think that at this moment the German army is attacking. Machine-guns rattling, bayonets flashing. - Just like at home. - Cake! Bah! The war has certainly brightened up people's dismal existence. The wedding service went without a hitch. The bride and groom fell to pieces! A good picture of marriage. Poke it and it collapses. - Ad?le... - It wasn't my fault. There you are, everybody. - Take the bits as they are. - Ad?le! May I remind you that you're a guest in this house? So I'm invited to sit and be polite and say nothing? Who do you think I am? Nobody mentions the uninvited guests curled up in the bellies of those two. Not a word! Why don't you drink their health? Because it would muck up all yourtalk of marriage and love. There is no love! Just beds and dirt and slime! Leave me alone! Let me go! I must apologize for her. Now look what I've done. When I was dressed up for once. - And you drag me out in the mud! - Go to bed. Kind, aren't you? A real man shouldn't be kind. A real man would give me a child. Or kill me! No, mind my dress! Poor Tord! You never dare take what you want. You missed your chance tonight with Petra! That woke you up, didn't it? Petra, so ladylike. She looks like one who has to satisfy herself. - Those are yourtricks. - Because I've no real man! Go on! Finish me off! That's what you want! Go on. Kill me! What went wrong? Strangled by the umbilical cord. Help me carry the bride into the bedroom! Here's to the bridal couple. I shall sleep like a log.
