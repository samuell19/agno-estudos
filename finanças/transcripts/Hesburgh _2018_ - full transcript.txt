In any list of the most influential men in American life, you'’ll find the predictable political leaders, commentators and tycoons. But one name that keeps cropping up is surprisingly none of those things. He advises presidents... He was a mythic figure. ...confers with the Pope. We heard these stories, growing up, about this legend. He is chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation and a director of the Chase Manhattan Bank. My God, how many lives did this man live? He is Father Theodore Martin Hesburgh, President of the University of Notre Dame. We don'’t prove anything by burning something down, we prove something by building it up. He knew everyone. I heard from some he was a very progressive liberal, and from some he was a very conservative man of the cloth. The University has to try to get people to be critical, find values that make life worth living. When you were dealing with a great difficulty, he'’s the kind of guy you would pick. He did too many things. You couldn'’t count them all. Everywhere you looked, there was Hesburgh. Father Hesburgh recognized that we all had a duty to serve and to give back. We all ought to be protesting against many of the things we see in modern life. Father Ted should be a saint. People have become concerned, people have begun to care. He was one of the outstanding figures of the 20th century. Since the age of six, all I wanted to be is a priest. Growing up in Syracuse, New York, I was never the kid playing fireman in the backyard. There wasn'’t a moment when I chose it. The priesthood was my calling. I think a lot of that came, maybe, from our family. Our mother and father were very religious. And I think that faith, once he decided to be a priest, just continued to grow. Post-war period, 98 % of the people said they believed in God. The churches were full. Priests were heroes in the movies. Sorts of people that went into the ministry were young men who would otherwise be doctors, lawyers, living through the most religious period in American history. A Holy Cross Priest encouraged me to study at Notre Dame, and I jumped at the chance. But priesthood wouldn'’t come without sacrifice. I think the tough part about being a priest is really leaving your family, and becoming part of another family. He was part of the CSC family. I was homesick at first, but my older sister, Mary, wrote me letters every week. She was my best friend. And no matter how tough my training became, she was there for me. I committed myself entirely to the priesthood, taking the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Being able to be married, have a family, but he was so focused and so dedicated on being a priest. You give up a life of wealth, marriage, and most of all, your freedom of choice. After my ordination, I desperately wanted to become a Navy Chaplain to do my part during World War II. But my superiors told me no, I was to get a doctorate and return to Notre Dame to teach. As time went on, I came to love teaching, and I had the chance to minister to all the returning veterans living on campus. It wasn'’t how I expected to serve my country, but I was serving in my own way. Then one day, a vow of obedience turned my world upside down. The President of Notre Dame called me and told me, "Ted, you'’re in charge." Oh, boy. Here we go. Father Hesburgh! Are you busy, Father? The Notre Dame administration saw in Hesburgh leadership, a very young man, and they groomed him. Nothing can prepare you for all of a sudden being in charge. I decided if I was going to be President, I had to shake things up. It was not that strong of a school. It needed a lot of push. In those days, what most people knew about Notre Dame was football. In a few years, they knew Notre Dame because Father Hesburgh was President there. He wanted to build a big university. He wanted the best. He wanted the excellence. No one wanted to talk academics. When I brought it up, a reporter threw me a football and told me to assume the hiking pose. I won'’t repeat what I said to him, but something had to change. To help me, I chose a talented priest named Ned Joyce as my vice president, and together, we pushed Notre Dame in a new direction. I'’d like to present this gentleman to you. His name is Father Edmund P. Joyce. I'’m Chairman of the Faculty Board and Control of Athletics at the University of Notre Dame. Hesburgh removed deans, he removed faculty members, he made a change, and he didn'’t accept less than excellence. He did a lot of things people would have thought as not particularly priestly. He was entrepreneurial. If you would look over here for a moment, you will notice a plan of Notre Dame as it is today, and Notre Dame as we hope it to become in the years immediately ahead. One of the greatest of all universities of all times, and I would like to tell you why. If we wanted excellence for the University, we needed money, and lots of it. Notre Dame presidents have always been priests, and as men under vows of poverty, fund-raising was not their strong suit. I had to do things differently, and I started by making some powerful friends. The remarkable thing that he did was, he met captains of industry who had lots of money, and in many cases, I think, were fascinated by the collar. Priests, they were fascinating characters. They took vows of celibacy. What'’s that all about? One of the major foundations was looking around to give money, and guess who popped up? Notre Dame in the person of Ted Hesburgh. To be his driver. Oh, my goodness, we just had a ball. He would share with me the letters that included checks. He'’d say, "Have you ever held a check worth five million dollars?" And he'’d pass the check up to the front seat. He was a man'’s man, would go back and have a drink and have cigars. And the women loved him. He was handsome. He won on both sides. Father Ted was drop-dead gorgeous. I mean, he could have gone in the movies. He was caring, he had humor, he had humanity. Mother met him at a YPO meeting. Ann Landers had 90 million readers. I remember when mother was named the most influential woman in America. She and Father Ted bonded. They both wanted to save the world. A friendship was beginning. I found myself rubbing shoulders with all sorts of people I'’d never have dreamed of meeting in my previous life, such as Cardinal Montini, the Vatican Secretary of State. And even Richard Nixon, Eisenhower'’s vice president, who came to Notre Dame to cheer on our rival, USC. We hit it off and began a long correspondence. Notre Dame was on the path to becoming one of the nation'’s greatest schools, until we came up against an obstacle from the last place we ever expected. As far as the Catholic Church goes, he was a bit of a renegade with regards to rules. He used common sense. At the start of my presidency, we invited a controversial priest named John Courtney Murray to speak at a conference on campus. Murray was upsetting the church for supporting religious liberty. He argued that disagreeing with the church doesn'’t always make someone wrong. People have differing opinions and the church had to be open to ideas instead of shutting them out. He was ahead of his time. We published Murray'’s lecture with all the others into a book, and the Vatican was furious. It was considered a heresy. You could be condemned for believing in religious liberty. John Courtney Murray, who was the great theologian proposing religious liberty, was silenced, was forbidden to publish in the 1950s. Cardinal Ottaviani, right-hand man to the Pope, sent a letter to my superior, ordering me to stop the book. He wrote, "Withdraw the book, do not say why, and do not mention my name." "Roma locuta est, causa finita est," meaning, "Rome has spoken, the cause is finished." It was censorship, and I told them, "No." I took a vow of obedience, but I had to draw a line. At a university, you can'’t censor ideas if they disagree with your own. I told Ottaviani, "If you withdraw this book, I resign as president." Well, the book sold out, and I kept my job. Things returned to normal with the Vatican, but I hoped they got the message. Because he was who he was, and had no ambition to someday be, you know, a cardinal or something moving up in the hierarchy and so on, he could speak his mind. With all the connections and friends I was making, they started reaching out to me for advice. And as a priest, it was my job to give them advice. So they kept calling. Dwight Eisenhower is very important in the evolution of Father Hesburgh as a public figure. Somehow or other, Father Hesburgh came to his attention very early in his career at Notre Dame. The National Science Board'’s job is to advise the President and Congress on all matters related to science. Eisenhower brought me on as a moral voice. To me, there didn'’t have to be a divide between theology and science. He took great pride in having participated in early advances in science because he wasn'’t a scientist, he was basically a philosopher. Soon, I was invited to join three other science boards. I was spending more and more time away from campus, but thankfully, Ned was always ready to take charge in my absence. Plus, I knew the connections could benefit the University, so I stayed on. Then one day, the Vatican called, asking about a very delicate science position that they needed to fill. The bomb is now at 8,500 feet, at 4,500 feet, approaching 1,500 feet. Watch the air overrun it. The nuclear threat is a very difficult threat to perceive. It'’s global. It'’s horrible. It'’s a threat that can annihilate human life. In the early '’50s, the threat became worse because Russia got the bomb. Now you'’ve got two nations that can nuke each other and didn'’t understand one another. Russia today is regarded as a grave threat to our nation, to our freedom, to the peace of the world. Back in the '’50s and '’60s, we were terrified. That became the era where we were told to hide under our desks because we might be nuked by Russia. The United States and the Soviet Union would be able to survive a nuclear attack, at least to the point of being able to launch a massive counterstrike. That threat was what Eisenhower wanted to address, and the International Atomic Energy Agency was formed. The Vatican looked for people who could speak to different cultures. I think that'’s why they reached out to Father Hesburgh. We had the world'’s two nuclear superpowers under one roof, and they wouldn'’t speak to each other. But, as a delegate of the Vatican, I could talk with the Russians without stirring up controversy. Mr. President, distinguished delegates, I would, first of all, like to associate myself with the kind and gracious words of the distinguished delegate of the Soviet Union. What we need to do to diminish this threat is to build bridges between Russia and the United States. The importance of having Father Hesburgh is that he could talk with Russian scientists and American scientists. They were pleased to have a mediator. Even if they didn'’t believe in the Catholic Church, they respected him as a man of religion. He was a very good friend of the delegate from Russia, whose name was Emelyanov. He became very close friends with him. Emelyanov and I bonded at the nightly cocktail parties. We both worked for universities, and after a few nights of socializing, we were thick as thieves. But I had to split my time between the American and Russian parties because they didn'’t invite each other. It was ridiculous, and I figured if we were ever going to have a conversation, I had to send out my own invitation. But the Vatican didn'’t throw cocktail parties. We held mass. I got both nations'’ delegates to attend, even though they weren'’t Catholic. The Russians couldn'’t even understand the church service. But I sat them next to each other, and for one hour a week, they were in the same room, talking. It may seem small, but it was a start. Father Hesburgh had an extraordinary ability to reach across lines. He often said that the Latin word for "priest" was "pontifex," "bridge builder." Ted was a bridge builder between people and God and among people. As I was coming back from that first summit in Vienna, I bought a copy ofTime magazine. I opened up at random and found a little article saying Congress was debating all summer on civil rights. For a problem so enormous, Congress came up with the same solution they always did: presidential commission. Historically, presidential commissions have been appointed when a President had a very tough problem and he didn'’t quite know what to do about it. Wherever the federal authority clearly extends, I will do the utmost that lies within my power to bring into living reality this expression of equality among all men who are citizens of this country. The idea was that there would be a federal commission for the first time, investigating and studying civil rights issues, thinking about the best and most creative ways that the federal government can engage. The commission would have the power of subpoenaing people, to require them to come and tell these representatives of the federal government exactly what was going on in the civil rights arena. The Civil Rights Commission had a lot of promise in it. What it would become and what it would do would depend on the people who were appointed to it. The first Sunday I was home, I got a call from the White House asking, "Have you heard of this Civil Rights Commission?" Well, he would'’ve said, "We'’re all created in the image of God. We'’re all equal in God'’s eyes, and all these other things that describe us are accidents of history." The President wanted to have three Republicans and three Democrats. He called Father Ted and said, "I need another Republican." Father Ted said, "I'’m an Independent," and the President said, "Close enough." Father Hesburgh was non-partisan. He was willing to get in there, roll up his sleeves and figure out, how do you come up with answers? The commission was given two years to investigate the civil rights problems down south and write a report telling Congress how to fix it. To make things more difficult, the commission was split evenly between three southerners and three northerners. Most thought we'’d be too busy arguing with each other to get anything done. Presidential commissions do their work, issue their study, goes on a shelf and then just sits there. But Hesburgh said, "We'’re not going to let that happen." We are trying to create one nation. It could very possibly be that we are verging through our institutions towards two societies, one black and one white, and that wouldn'’t be America, I don'’t think. White children and colored children integration, throughout of which will come a mongrel class of people! I say for the mothers to keep their kids out of school! We are white people! We don'’t want them to go to school with Negroes! The commission was asked to zero in on the voting issue down south, which Congress agreed was the most crucial civil rights problem. Black citizens all over the south were denied the right to vote, but Congress didn'’t have the evidence to prove it yet. Our first hearing was in Montgomery, Alabama, once the scene of the Confederacy and probably as close to the heart of the civil rights problem as you could get. Alabama and Mississippi were the places where the most egregious of civil rights violations occurred. It was a very scary time for the commissioners to go to Alabama. In Montgomery, the most important person we had to subpoena was a county judge who refused to let us examine the county voting records. The judge said he would burn the records before he'’d turn them over. His name, by the way, was George Wallace. I will not comply, and I will not produce records as requested by this subpoena issued by the Civil Rights Commission here in Montgomery, Alabama. We came into town just as Wallace was campaigning for governor. He had promised to keep Alabama segregated, and we were his first test. George Wallace threatened to put the commissioners in jail if they came to Alabama. They went anyway. We wrote ahead for hotel reservations in Montgomery, but with three blacks in our group, including Commissioner Wilkins, we were turned down everywhere. We thought we could solve the problem by staying at Maxwell Air Force Base, but we were told that the people of Montgomery would never stand for whites sharing barracks with blacks. There was only one thing left to do: go directly to Eisenhower. Ike blew a fuse. He wrote a scathing executive order saying the General was out of his damned mind to turn us away, and they'’d have to take us in. Let them come. This is just another evidence of government by threat, force, and intimidation. Ladies and gentlemen, this public hearing of the United States Commission on Civil Rights will now come to order. As it turned out, practically nobody was registered to vote in Montgomery County. They had all kinds of cute tricks. Like they automatically registered all the white people, but for the blacks, they had the registration say from 4:00 to 5:00 on the first Monday of the month in some godforsaken place. Many of the black citizens were given what was supposed to be a reading comprehension test. Once the line formed up, they would take one person and flunk him. None have passed the test. The test was so difficult, not even the registrar in charge of grading them could pass it. Would you please make a reasonable interpretation of Section 182? I will not. - You decline to-- - Yes, sir. You decline to interpret Section 182? - I do. On what grounds? On pressure being put on me before a committee like this. On the ground that it will incriminate you? That'’s right. We had racist high-school dropouts telling black PhDs from Tuskegee University that they weren'’t able to vote because they weren'’t ready yet to have them vote. All testimony at the hearing verifies this. To call this devious shows a lack of understanding of the independence and procedure of the state courts of Alabama. Over the years, 1,600 people tried to register and all of them were turned down. There was not a single black person in all of Montgomery County who was registered to vote. Sheriff, we'’ve been hearing all morning and afternoon about fear. Can you think of any reasons why there would be fear among the community on a basis of trying to register to vote? No, no, I can'’t understand them having a fear of me. I'’ve asked myself this. Can you... Has there ever been in history a good society built on fear? Father Hesburgh and US Commission on Civil Rights: their leadership is in many ways when this country decided, "We'’re not gonna go backwards. We'’re gonna go forward." We were all very proud of what he was accomplishing, but during that period, our family saw very little of him because he was only home maybe one week a year on vacation. The distance didn'’t make it easy to visit family. My schedule didn'’t make it easy. I think the hardest thing that Ted encountered on a personal basis during his lifetime was the loss of our sister, Mary. Ted and Mary were very, very close. They were 18 months apart. I was on a trip when I got word she was dying. Breast cancer. I flew home straightaway and found her bedridden. I said mass for her and asked if she wanted me to anoint her. "Why the heck do you think I sent for you?" She said. "Just for fun and games?" I was with her when she died. In fact, I was the only one with her. He talked about it often. That really got to Ted. He was very, very close to her. That had a big impact on him. I think that was his first real loss. You could see he felt that pain, but he also never lost hope. It'’s because of his faith, um, that he was a man of hope. "We'’re gonna get through this." In my faith, you learn there'’s meaning in suffering. But to truly understand that, you have to first suffer, yourself. It tests your faith, but in the end, I found strength. And as a priest, I wanted to help others find their own strength, even in the greatest of suffering. We have created a kind of social situation where discrimination bears upon a person because of his color a thousand times a day. He can'’t do this, he can'’t do that. He'’s lacked many things that we take for granted, or our youngsters take for granted. And therefore, you cannot put all these inhibitions around a person then say, "Why don'’t you try harder?" Well, of course we could all do better if we worked harder, but it'’s like holding a man under water and saying, "Why don'’t you swim?" The commission had been traveling around for two years, conducting hearings and gathering testimony, and it came time for the commission to write its first report. The problem was so much more than voting. Black citizens were denied housing and education. But the southerners on the commission argued that voting was enough. They sat in a room and never talked to each other. There was southern blood, Yankee blood, anti-blacks. You know, tough stuff. Our two years was almost up and we had to write our report. Without it, the commission was finished, along with any chances for a real civil rights law. They were in Shreveport, Louisiana. It was over 100 degrees. We tried to finish the report, but we were crammed together at another air base. Planes were roaring every night. We couldn'’t sleep, the food was terrible, the weather was awful. We couldn'’t bring ourselves to finish it. One night, Commissioner John Battle came knocking on my door. I was the only one who would drink bourbon with him, so we stayed up talking over drinks. He was a staunch segregationist, but we still found common ground. That got me thinking. I called up one of the University'’s donors and asked him to send his private plane, so it could take us away from Shreveport to Land O'’Lakes, Wisconsin. Land O'’Lakes is University property. It'’s 6,000 or 7,000 acres of lakes and woods. It'’s very primitive. It was Father Hesburgh'’s favorite place. I called Land O'’Lakes and said, "Make sure you'’ve got food and drinks for 15 people and meet us at the airport at 5:00." We all huddled onto the plane and began drafting the report. We wrote out all 12 recommendations to Congress. That was easy. The hard part now was getting the commission to agree. We needed a miracle. Ted told me. He said it was going nowhere. But I found one thing running through our conversations, that they all liked the fish. First evening at Land O'’Lakes was everything I hoped it would be. The air was crisp, the lakes were shimmering, and the steaks and bourbon could not have tasted better. The Lord must'’ve been with us that evening because we all caught fish, a lot of fish. I mean, like 20 or 30. They'’d never seen anything like this in their lives. After months of fighting, the arguing stopped. I arranged to put bitter rivals like Governor Battle and George Johnson in the same boat. And after a few hours of fishing, even a segregationist and a black civil rights lawyer can get along. Once they trusted each other, they were able to do tremendous work. When the day was done, we gathered onto the porch and voted on the recommendations. He loved to watch people who didn'’t agree on anything get in the room and bridge all that. You almost got this sense that if Father Hesburgh'’s for it, then we all ought to be for it. The catalyst was the fishing, and the real catalyst was Ted. We unanimously agreed on 11 of the 12 recommendations. We couldn'’t believe it, but we now had everything Congress needed to draft a civil rights law. We took the report to Eisenhower, and he laughed out of shock. He said, "How did this happen? This whole commission was a put-on, and here we have three Democrats, a couple of Republicans and an Independent priest, and we got you to agree on civil rights?" I said, "Mr. President, we may have had our disagreements, but at the end of the day, we were all fishermen." At school, we were having trouble finding a commencement speaker and a cardinal for graduation mass. It was a month before graduation, and we still had no one. Things were getting dicey. My assistant, Helen, had never failed me before, so I turned her loose on half the problem. "You suggest the speaker," I said, "and I'’ll find the cardinal." She thought for a moment, then suggested, "Let'’s ask President Eisenhower." I said, "Everybody in the world wants the President to be the speaker. How are you going to get--" "Well," she said, "you'’ll never know if you don'’t try." I said, "All right. You'’re a great fan of Eisenhower, so you write the letter to him, and I'’ll write a letter to my friend Cardinal Montini to preach the Homily." We promptly got back two acceptances. Eisenhower said, "Since I was a kid, I wanted a degree from Notre Dame. I don'’t know if I'’ve got anything worthwhile to say to your students, but I'’ll be glad to come." Peace or war. These are the substance of the political decisions and actions that you young people must be ready to participate in. So after scrambling to get anyone we could find, we brought in the President of the United States and Cardinal Montini, who was about to become the most powerful man in the Catholic Church. I came to know all of the popes throughout my life, but the only one I considered a true friend was Giovanni Montini, who who would take on the name Pope Paul VI. He could talk to me about topics like nuclear war and the state of the Catholic Church. If we thought the other was wrong, we would say so. We respected each other. He was constantly presenting me with gifts. I finally got to return the favor when I found out that the Pope and I both had a love for space travel. TheApollo flights were beginning and I called up my friend, Jim Webb, the head of NASA, to send me films. I would join the Pope for dinner and we'’d set up the projector, pour a drink, and watch as mankind took its first journeys into space. The Pope watched with astonishment. It was a rare chance for both of us to escape, to relax. It was easy to forget I was sitting next to one of the most powerful men in the world. A man who was overseeing the most momentous religious event of the 20th century. Considered one of the most important councils in Catholic Church history, Vatican II saw 2,400 bishops and other prelates revise many aspects of church activity. The council produced 16 documents, designed to modernize the role of the church in world affairs, and its work was carried on by Paul VI. I have seen more change in the Catholic Church than I think took place in the church in the last 450 years since the reformation. Hesburgh was profoundly affected by Vatican II and used that change in the church to direct his own life. His instincts about laities, instincts about engaging the culture come out of that Vatican II mentality. The church was respecting new ideas, religions, and getting the laypeople involved. I went to the Vatican and saw John Courtney Murray giving a speech. The Catholic Church was entering the modern age, and the Pope wanted people he trusted by his side. Paul VI wanted to make him chief of the military chaplain, which would have been an automatic Cardinal. I was in the Pope'’s private library and he handed me a small leather box. And inside was an enormous emerald ring. He said, "I wore this as a Cardinal, and now it'’s yours." The Cardinal'’s ring, given to Father Hesburgh, clearly in the hope that he would wear it, as a Cardinal, as a prince of the church. He thought about it and told me, "I can do a lot more as a head of a university. I'’ve got way more freedom than anybody else does." There'’s no job for an American Catholic priest that is better than being President of the University of Notre Dame. Why would you leave that to become a bishop? Of what? Of Salt Lake City? I politely said, "Thank you for the ring, Your Holiness," and then put it in my pocket. Secretary damn near died. He said, "What are you doing? He just gave you his ring! His ring! Pazzo Americano!" That means "crazy American." He used to keep the Pope'’s ring in his drawer, which was not a good idea. It'’d be rolling around with this cigar cutter. People gave him incredible things, and he appreciated it. And he would say, "Thanks!" But he'’d, you know, throw it in a drawer or whatever. He was pretty protective of his cigars, I gotta tell you that. So... I mean, he traveled the world. He was everywhere, but Notre Dame was always home. Students like to tell this story. They say, "You'’re walking around campus at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, you see the light, so you climb the fire escape and knock on the window. You end up having coffee and talking out your problems with the president of the University." You needed advice, you'’d go to Father Hesburgh. You had an issue, you'’d go to Father Hesburgh. I mean, it was just-- His door was always open. He was very much like a father figure. He was a priest and he always said, "That'’s my primary identity." That pastoral contact with people never left him. The kids got to know him. So all the kids in the dorms would call him "Uncle Ted." "Hi, Uncle Ted." "Hi, dear." The bad part of that was if we were out in a social situation, it would take us a half an hour to get out the door. You know, he was beloved. He was like Santa. I'’ll never forget, I think I was all of 32 years old, and I went in to see Father Hesburgh to ask him for some advice about running for Congress, and while he couldn'’t endorse me, which I would'’ve loved, especially running in my home district in South Bend, he gave me some of the best advice I'’ve ever had. Serve our country, put your country before party and before politics, and always do the right thing. It sounds easy. It sounds like a platitude, a motto, but sometimes that'’s really, really hard. Father Hesburgh was asked how he managed to maintain relatively good rapport with his students. He said, "Well, if you'’ve got someone weird enough to be walking around at 3:00 in the morning, wanting to talk, and a President weird enough to want to talk to him, you get along." It'’s very hard to neatly categorize my relationship with Father Hesburgh. I grew up without a father. And when I got to Notre Dame, I had a father. And his name was Theodore M. Hesburgh. I didn'’t know he would be my father, but that'’s how he functioned, and he was... He was the largest figure in my life. We had this unusual relationship, and I'’d given him a lot of trouble through the years because I was editor of the student newspaper. I mean, we argued, sometimes very strenuously. Sometimes I was just so full of myself that it was idiotic, but he wasn'’t perfect either, and he wasn'’t afraid to admit that. He really looked after me. I was waiting for Father, taking him to Chicago where he was being honored, and I see a young student. She kept wiping her eyes, and he brings her out. And I say, "Well, we'’re supposed to go to Chicago." He said, "Marty, just take the bag, put it in my room in Corby, and I'’ll... I'’ll talk to you tomorrow." This young lady'’s father had passed away. The family didn'’t have the resources for her to stay at Notre Dame. Father Ted took care of that. That young lady graduated from Notre Dame. That was my Father Ted. Nobody watching, you know, just... They were talking about how he would be gone so much and he would travel around, but the reason he did that was to set the example for the faculty and for the students, that the institution needed to be engaged in the world. My uncle was in the limelight, and Father Joyce was really at home keeping things running smoothly. It was a marriage, of sense. Father Ted had such confidence in Father Ned. To keep the place going would allow him to be away from Notre Dame as often as he was. Ted and Ned were a great team, and I used to say it was Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside. He was away a great deal, with good reason. When he was away, then I became acting president, but we never had any crises while he was away, thank God. He'’s just been a wonderful, wonderful priest and a wonderful friend. My friends, though, would often implore me to slow down, especially Eppie Lederer, whom the world knew as Ann Landers. Our correspondence grew more and more frequent as the years went on, and I even started to have a hand in her work. Mother'’s MO for the column was to rely on experts. I don'’t pretend to be an authority on every subject. In fact, I don'’t pretend to be an authority on any subject because when they write to Ann Landers, they'’re... They'’re getting the top-notch brains in the country. She was very well-connected. There was nobody who'’d not return a call from Ann Landers. I'’ve been lucky, my friends are marvelous. They'’re people like... like Ted Hesburgh, the President of Notre Dame. People would write her about their most intimate problems, the type of things I'’d hear in confession. She'’d secretly forward me their letters and say, "I think we can help this person." I'’d look into it and then write her back saying, "Case solved." Father Ted was not only her theological adviser for letters that came to the column that had to do with religion, but he was her adviser. Now, this is only peculiar because we are Jewish. He was her go-to guy when she had a problem, because she trusted him. It was a friendship between advice-givers, and I needed advice just like everyone else. She could always help when the job got tough, and on the Civil Rights Commission, the job was about to get very tough. As Eisenhower'’s time in office was ending, the commission worried the President wouldn'’t act on our recommendations. See, on their own, our recommendations were worthless. They needed to be turned into law, and then that law needed to be enforced. I wrote to my friend Richard Nixon, hoping he would push the President to act, but he couldn'’t change Eisenhower'’s mind. So the buck got passed to the next President. I'’m not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights. I think we can do better. I knew the Kennedys through Father John Kavanagh, my predecessor at Notre Dame. And Jack seemed just the person to push Congress to turn our findings into law. There was enormous hope throughout the country. The commissioners thought that John Kennedy would be a friend. But President Kennedy didn'’t act on our recommendations. In fact, he almost completely ignored them. People in Mississippi begged the commissioners to come to Mississippi. But every time they'’d get ready to go, somebody would come from the White House and say, "Could y'’all think about that a little bit more?" And since Kennedy was a friend, at first they said, "Well, he must have some reason." The President'’s right-hand man and Attorney General was his brother Bobby, who made it clear that pushing for civil rights would cost the President the south, and a second term. "If we do this, we'’re gonna lose the south." John Kennedy didn'’t take that risk. We told the President and his brother, "Now is the time to act. We need a civil rights law." But Bobby disagreed and called the commission "second guessers." He complained that with every civil rights decision he made, Father Hesburgh was always around the corner to say, "You'’re not doing enough." There were a lot of politicians who wanted to kinda slow-walk this stuff and not create waves in their communities or upset people. In a democracy, we govern either by leadership or by crisis. And if leadership is not there, we will ultimately govern by crisis. We came here 10,000 strong. We said we would come again and again... There were two very different sides in the fight for civil rights. On one side was our commission, fighting with hearings and reports. On the other side were civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., taking their fight to the streets in mass protest. When Father Hesburgh came into the Civil Rights Movement, he brought with him a reputation of a values-based leader in our country. King was leading a movement. Hesburgh was on a Civil Rights Commission. They occupied very different places in society. It'’s a very different kind of thing to be, sort of, a presidential appointee and leading a movement. King rallied the country to take a stand for civil rights, even making a stop at Notre Dame. The Negro has a double burden, outright discrimination in employment. I imagine you have a little of that in South Bend. He wants a fair opportunity and a fair share of the society he has also contributed to over all these years. On campus, the students wanted to join the cause, but if they were going to protest, I wanted them to do it the right way. Do I have a moment to say something? - Yes. I met a youngster the other night and he said, "I'’m going to Canada to teach school." And I said, "Why are you going to Canada to teach school?" "Well, I'’m upset about this country, its racial problem. I want to disassociate myself from this country." And I said, "Well, if you want to disassociate yourself from this country, get up and leave and go someplace else and do something good. But if you want to do something good, I think there'’s a lot of room right here to do something good." But he said, "I'’m just upset about the country." I said, "Well, then do something about it. It'’s your country. It'’s your problem." I wanted the students to face the country'’s issues instead of running away. I wanted them to speak their minds while letting those who disagreed do the same. I wanted the students to protest with respect, even in the face of hatred. It'’s a hot time in the old town tonight. The Notre Dame Texas Club invited Wallace to campus. He criticized the same Civil Rights Law I was pushing to enact. But as a university, we felt he had the right to speak. If the law can compel me to employ a Negro, it can compel that Negro to work for me. Father Hesburgh would bring the different voices, the different perspectives there to listen to them, maybe to learn something new from them, or to learn how to debate against those views. And I always thought that the hallmark of a liberal was that they would listen to all sides, but... I hope you'’d let... Show that fellow where the little room is. As tensions rose down south and the influence of the Civil Rights Movement continued to spread, our leaders finally began to act. Kennedy had initiated some civil rights legislation against the advice of his brothers, against the advice of the party. He saw that something needed to be done. Hesburgh thought Kennedy was heroic for doing this despite all the obstacles. In too many parts of the country, wrongs are inflicted on Negro citizens and there are no remedies of law. I am therefore asking the Congress to enact legislation. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. You'’ll excuse the fact that I am out of breath, but... about ten or 15 minutes ago, a tragic thing, from all indications at this point, has happened in the city of Dallas. If John F. Kennedy'’s death had any message, it was this: get on the road because the hour is late. The Civil Rights Commission met with our new President, Lyndon Johnson, during his first days in office. Johnson looked pale and exhausted. He was under enormous strain from the presidency. We talked to him about a plan for civil rights, a need for legislation. He told us, "If I'’m gonna be known as a good president, I'’ve gotta do something." The dream of equal rights for all Americans must and will be translated into effective action. Johnson met with the House and Senate, telling them, "This law is going to pass." He slammed a folder onto the table, and inside of it were our commission'’s recommendations. The President was playing hardball. He had this little book of all the Senators and Congressmen and their foibles. Whenever he didn'’t know something, he called J. Edgar Hoover at the FBI. He called each lawmaker around 3:00 a.m., saying, "This is your President, and I understand you are not going to vote for my bill." They'’d say, "Lyndon, come on. You'’re a Southerner. I vote for your bill, and they'’ll cut my throat." And Johnson said, "If you don'’t vote for my bill, I'’ll cut your throat." Or Johnson said, "Let'’s say the front page of theWashington Post says, '‘What is the Senator doing in Room 346 of the Mayflower Hotel every Saturday night at 9:00? Is he up there saying the "Our Father" with somebody?'’" He literally blackmailed everybody that he had something on, and he had something on just about everybody. Johnson was absolutely ruthless in this pursuit. You don'’t read about it in history books, but that'’s how it happened. I know because I was there. As Johnson was working his powers of persuasion, King was working from the outside, hoping to send a message to Congress. But his rallies were met with violence. The Florida Advisory Committee to the US Civil Rights Commission warned that the city was becoming a racial super bomb with a short fuse. The situation had become so serious, to create a special state police force. We have further agreed to call off demonstrations. There was a time when Martin Luther King was seen as a major hot potato. He was a renegade and a rebel. There were people who thought that he was a Communist, and people were scared of him. King prepared for his next rally in Chicago, but his gatherings earned a violent reputation. This was King'’s chance to show Congress a peaceful gathering of civil rights, but when he invited the Mayor and Archbishop, both declined to attend. Many people in the American government thought of Martin Luther King as an alien enemy agent, somebody who'’s gonna totally ruin society. Ted would'’ve been aware of threats made against him and other civil rights leaders. Father Hesburgh was asked to join Martin Luther King in Chicago. He wasn'’t worried about the controversy. His only response was, "When do you want me there?" He was putting his moral weight behind Martin Luther King and what he was trying to do. All that we cherish at the base of the great dream of America demands a dedication to the dignity of man. The God-given dignity of every human being. When a man who'’s working the government and the official side, the commission side, shows up in Chicago, he'’s moved to the movement side. It'’s a different place for him to be. And I think that had a lot of power. We have come a long, long way in the civil rights struggle, but let me remind you this afternoon that we have a long, long way to go. And I think that was a real moment in his life to be shown there with the civil rights leaders, that he was down in the audience and Martin Luther King called him up to the stage. ♪ We shall overcome♪ What Father Hesburgh did by grasping Martin Luther King'’s arms that day is he said, "This is a partnership in America." Civil rights is not just about black Americans. It'’s about... It'’s about all of us. And what we are. What are our qualities, what are our values as human beings? Eleven days later, we made history. The Civil Rights Commission was responsible for the groundwork on every civil rights law that passed after it was established. Every single one. Despite all the obstacles along the road, this country finally had a true Civil Rights Law. Now we just had to make sure it was enforced. The world was rapidly changing. Johnson sent more troops over to Vietnam, hoping to achieve peace without conquest. For the Catholic Church, meanwhile, Vatican II came to a close. Though the Church progressed in many ways, one of the most important issues, in my mind, remained unsolved. A lot of people believe that Notre Dame is part of the Catholic Church, at least financially. It isn'’t. We don'’t get one single nickel from the Catholic Church, haven'’t for a hundred years. In the wake of Vatican II, Catholic universities faced a critical question: was it possible to be both a great university and Catholic? I believed it was. As long as there was balance. Father Ted could go back in his presidency and point to various efforts by Rome to curtail something that was happening at Notre Dame. Hesburgh had to do what the Vatican said to do, so they were under the authority of the Catholic Church. Cardinal Ottaviani sent Catholic universities a list of moral positions, telling schools what was forbidden to teach in their classes. There'’s probably no better way to provoke thought about something than to tell human beings they can'’t think about it. I was entirely devoted to the Church, but I wouldn'’t let it stand in the way of education. The word Catholic means "universal." Father Hesburgh believes a Catholic university is one that doesn'’t shut out ideas, whether you agree or not. I believed education had to have morals, but there had to be a way to balance faith and academics. Vatican II inspired laypeople to be involved in the church, and I wanted the same for Notre Dame. The University would no longer be run only by priests. If the institution is in the hands of lay boards, that gives them an amount of freedom that they wouldn'’t have otherwise. We began a shared governance of clergy, educators, businessmen, and civil rights leaders. He ended up replacing some of these Catholics on the board with men who weren'’t. I'’m the first Jewish trustee of Notre Dame. In fact, at my first trustees'’ meeting, I felt everybody was eyeing me a little suspiciously. So I said, "Don'’t worry, guys. I'’m not anti-pigskin, but please, no more football on the Jewish Sabbath." There was a certain amount of resentment. Notre Dame, to these Catholic members of the board, was their university. I was criticized for the changes, but there was more to be done. Vatican II didn'’t provide a document on Catholic education. So I gathered a group to write one ourselves. Many of the Vatican II participants came together again for what'’s been called "Vatican Two-and-a-Half." Like the Civil Rights Commission before, we all met in Land O'’Lakes, Wisconsin. Clergy, laymen, educators from Georgetown to Boston College, all gathered together to draft a document on what a Catholic University should be. Among those who were present at Land O'’Lakes, there was a mix of clergy, laypeople, representing different points of view and backgrounds, all in good conversation, and that was the model for what should be going on in the church in general. It was part of his genius to pull that off. A Catholic University must have true autonomy and academic freedom in the face of authority. There must be no outlawed books or subjects. Catholicism must be perceptively present and effectively operative. We must examine all aspects of society and the church, and objectively evaluate them. The Catholic University of the future will be a true, modern university. The document became known as the Land O'’Lakes Statement. Notre Dame is a crossroads where all the intellectual and moral currents of our times meet in dialogue. A place where all of the burning issues that affect the Church and the world today are plumbed to their depths in an atmosphere of faith. Where differences of culture, religion, and conviction can coexist with friendship, civility, and even love. When it comes to education, we want to call the shots. Rome didn'’t like that very well. Not many things happened in 1967 that are still controversial, but Land O'’Lakes is one of them. Some of the authorities in Rome didn'’t like it because it looked like it was taking away some of their control. For some, to waver from the Catholic Church was a step on a wayward path, and Hesburgh was leading them in the wrong direction. There is a conservative element in the Church that believes that'’s the point at which Catholic universities began shedding their Catholic identity. Ironically, Notre Dame is not one of them. But there are other Catholic universities where, sadly, that'’s not the case anymore. Many believed the document encouraged schools to sacrifice their religion for academic prowess. That we were losing everything that separated us from the secular universities. We were trying to create high-quality universities that also took religious side seriously. And there'’s always a balancing act that goes along with that. The assumption people have is that every time you have change, it'’s bad. I say my assumption is that change is the price of progress. Tensions rose when an Archbishop criticized the Catholic Church, taking aim not at the Pope, but his advisers, and I publicly took his side. The Vatican called days later, exclaiming the Pope was furious with my position, that I'’d betrayed him as a friend. I said I didn'’t attack him, I criticized his council. I said what was on my mind. But it didn'’t matter. They gave me an ultimatum, saying, "Retract the statement, or you will fall from the Pope'’s good graces." I said, "No, you'’re confusing honesty with loyalty. The most loyal thing I can do for the Pope is to be honest with him, which I'’ve always been. I stand by my position." I didn'’t know it then, but his advisers misled me. The Pope wasn'’t angry. I don'’t think he even knew what happened. I stopped visiting him, and he didn'’t know why. The late '’60s shook America to its core. I speak out against this war because I'’m disappointed with America. There can be no great disappointment, where there is no great love. Martin Luther King, 20 minutes ago, died. Senseless murders that made our youth recognize the depth of this nation'’s divide. That their America was not one and indivisible, and the war in Vietnam only deepened their outrage. Now we find that Richard Milhous Nixon is going to be the 37th President of the United States. Five years ago, American combat troops were first sent to Vietnam. We'’re not going to withdraw from that effort. It would not bring peace. It would bring more war. A fire was lit, and suddenly, the pain of war became the pain of the students. If you do it unto the least of these, my brethren, ye do it unto me. As the Vietnam War escalated, President Nixon called upon college presidents to end the protests erupting on their campuses. But the students were passionate and weren'’t about to let up. No school could maintain order, including Notre Dame. ♪ There'’s a riot going on♪ ♪ There'’s a riot going on♪ ♪ There'’s a riot going on♪ ♪ Student demonstration time♪ It was really a time of turmoil and turbulence. This was the time of the draft. Anybody could be called up, except if you were in college. That created, I think, a sense of guilt among many of the young men and women who were in college. As the faces of authority at Notre Dame, Ned Joyce and I faced backlash and uproar from our students like never before. We did our best to keep Notre Dame from devolving into chaos, which proved far more difficult than we ever imagined. At Notre Dame, there were protests, there were draft card burnings. Students yelling and screaming. But he wasn'’t afraid of anybody. He had an allegiance to the military. He admired the men and women who served. One has to remember that at that time, most people were for the war. We did our best to maintain order, to let outside know that everything was under control. The most natural thing I could do here today is talk about student unrest, but I suspect most of you have had it about up to here, and I have to admit that I have had it up to here also. But every day, Ned and I knew that this dam could burst at any moment. One by one, college and university presidents resigned amidst the chaos. Starts with Clark Kerr of Berkeley, Grayson Kirk of Columbia. Two pages, both sides, and three columns on the back. I wrote down each of their names, reminding myself I could be next. As the campus protests intensified, Nixon continued to call for a way to control it. Many of these pickets who say they'’re for peace, and I'’m sure they'’re well-intentioned, they haven'’t been there. The war in Vietnam is being fought to prevent World War III. That'’s what'’s involved here. That'’s what these poor, stupid people don'’t understand. I had always supported the students'’ right to protest, but it was now becoming dangerous and standing in the way of classes and education. It was time to draw the line. Reverend Theodore Hesburgh today announced a "Get Tough" policy. Father Hesburgh said demonstrators will be given 15 minutes to halt their protest. If they don'’t, they'’ll be suspended on the spot. If they do not halt within another five minutes, they will be expelled. Within two days, the letter was reported in every newspaper in the country. The rule was clear and simple: 15 minutes and you'’re out. Many saw it as a blueprint for stopping student protests. We thought a University was a place where you discuss things, but it'’s not a place where you prevent people from discussing things. People who see him as a liberal hero have got to remember, no, he'’s more complicated than that. When the CIA and Dow Chemical held interviews on campus, 12 students blocked anyone from entering the offices. They told the other students, "If you'’re going into that interview, you'’ll have to walk over us first." As I promised, they had 15 minutes to move or they'’d be suspended. We gave them 20, and they didn'’t flinch. I couldn'’t back down on this. And when it was all over, five students were expelled. I was just stunned that he could go for that. It seemed so Nixonian. Fifteen minutes or you'’re out. And back then, if you were thrown out of school, it was the equivalent of a death sentence because you would be drafted and be sent off to Indochina. And I wrote him. I said, "I think this is appalling." Anson sent me a telegram criticizing my 15-minute rule. He ended his message with a call for my resignation. I mean, what'’s the whole business about due process and civil rights? The only moral thing you can do is resign. That really hurt him. Would you consider stepping down as President of Notre Dame? I think I would be an absolute fool if I never considered stepping down. Everybody in this job in the whole country considers stepping down about five times a week. I received thousands of letters both praising and condemning the 15-minute rule. But one powerful voice came to my defense. President Nixon today in a letter to Father Theodore Hesburgh, the President of the University of Notre Dame, applauded Father Hesburgh'’s tough stand on protests and demonstrations. In his letter today, Mr. Nixon wrote to Father Hesburgh, "I applaud the forthright stand you have taken." Father Ted was much in the news because he had, according to Nixon, stood up to the protesters at Notre Dame, the students. And Nixon took that to mean that Hesburgh was on his side. Nixon called me to Washington to discuss the protests and my future in the government. I was still on the Civil Rights Commission and I told him I'’d be resigning soon to focus more on Notre Dame. But Nixon had something else in mind. President Nixon today named the President of Notre Dame University, Father Theodore Hesburgh, as Chairman of the Civil Rights Commission. Father Hesburgh has served on that commission for 11 years. I could have said no. We'’d done our jobs. Civil Rights laws were finally on the books. But someone would have to ensure they were enforced. And I couldn'’t help but wonder, if I said no, whom Nixon would appoint in my stead. After I took the job, Nixon and I continued to stay in touch. But as the Vietnam War intensified, our friendship was about to be tested. Good evening, my fellow Americans. North Vietnam has increased its military aggression in Cambodia. I have concluded that the time has come for action. After promising to withdraw troops, Nixon expanded the war into Cambodia. Student protests became violent, burning and bombing ROTC buildings on their campuses to rebel against the military. The National Students Association called for a shutdown of all university campuses in all states to protest the Cambodian War. Father Theodore Hesburgh, President of Notre Dame University, had said he didn'’t want, and would not accept, any kind of student strike. I was the Student Body President. I felt that there was a need for a different type of education, and that a student strike would be the means to come to that end. There was no question that Father Hesburgh did not want to have any kind of student strike at his University. The Student Body President, Dave Krashna, invited me to speak at a rally to protest the Cambodia invasion. I was warned it was a set-up for humiliation. This was my one shot to prevent a strike. I had to take an honest stand against the war. But I never could have predicted the tragedy about to come out of Kent State. Four students shot and killed by the National Guard. As the news reached Notre Dame, I was already giving my speech. Evil may be, and often is, completely victorious in the lives of persons and in the lives of nations. But do we stand tall, as persons or as a nation, in such a victory? There comes a time in life, in personal life and in national life, when moral righteousness is more important than empty victory. I must tell you honestly that violence is the worst reaction to the violence that all of us abhor in Vietnam. I came out against Nixon, but I couldn'’t stop the student strike. The campus shut down, and the students were restless. In the wake of Kent State, they wanted to act. We both had jobs to do. He did his job, and I thought I did my job. All these students, my classmates, they wanted to do something. A large group of students gathered outside my office, asking for copies of my speech. "How many?" I asked. They said, "Thousands. We'’re going to have students go to every house in town to try to get them to sign it." I said, "Tell you what. You do all that, and I'’ll send it off to Nixon." I think they fundamentally bought non-violence, and they fundamentally preserved non-violence. And there were probably a few youngsters around here that would have liked to have thrown a Molotov cocktail, say, at the ROTC building. And we didn'’t stop them, it was the other students that stopped them and said, "You do that and you distract the nation from what we'’re trying to say here and what we'’re trying to prove, that peace is important, that human life is important and sacred. That we have to learn to talk to each other." We waited for Nixon'’s response. But the letter never came. During the week of the strike, the students and I continued to speak out against the war. We held mass on campus to honor the lives it claimed. But as I waited for Nixon to respond, I received word that a former student was in desperate need of help. Robert Anson, a correspondent for Timemagazine, disappeared in Cambodia, and villagers said Communist troops disabled his car with gunfire and then dragged him away into the woods. They pulled me out of a car and threw me into a hole about four feet deep and threw in a trenching tool and gestured, "Dig deeper." And I knew I was digging my own grave because they were killing Americans like that. An officer came over and took the trenching tool back and put his foot on my chest and leaned me up against the hole and put his AK to my forehead, the barrel of his AK to my forehead and then locked and loaded. I knew exactly one word of Vietnamese and it was the right word. I said "Hoòa biình," and it meant "peace" in Vietnamese. The State Department confirmed this afternoon that Robert Anson, a correspondent for Timemagazine is presumed captured by the Viet Cong. The chief at the Time Life News Service flew to Notre Dame and made an appointment to see Father Hesburgh at night. And he told him the situation. And he said, "Unless you can do something to intervene, he'’ll be dead." He had lots of telephones on his big desk in the President'’s office, and he reached over and he picked up one and he put it to his ear and the receiver to his ear. And the first words out of his mouth were, "Your Holiness." He called the Pope. And he said, "You were a journalist before you became a priest, and we gave you an honorary degree from Notre Dame." He said, "I have a close friend of mine. He'’s a journalist and he'’s in big trouble. So we'’d like you to do what you can." Robert Anson, looking thin after three weeks as an enemy prisoner in Cambodia, drove into Phnom Penh today, a free man. Bob, do you think you'’ll be doing any more reporting out of Cambodia? When I was released, I went up to see Father Hesburgh that night to say thank you. I talked with the Pope. He asked, "Where have you been? You don'’t visit anymore." I thought he was angry with me. But he made me promise to visit next time I was in Rome. He missed his friend. It was like we'’d never stopped speaking. But as one friendship came back into my life, another was falling apart. Nixon never responded to the letter from my students. And I couldn'’t remain silent on his actions while he refused to speak to me. And it wasn'’t just Vietnam. As the 1970 mid-term elections neared, we on the Civil Rights Commission began to notice a disturbing trend. The worst single offender of Civil Rights violations was Nixon'’s own government. Richard Nixon had supported Civil Rights, really, when he was a senator. But he was also a political individual who wanted to win. Nixon decided the key to his ability to win would be to turn to the South, and to build what became known as the Southern Strategy. If he made a big deal about his opposition to Civil Rights, the white southerners would vote for him. The result was that very little progress was made for a number of years. Father Ted referred to the Civil Rights Commission as the "Conscience of the Government." The commission will pay attention to what the government is doing, and if it'’s doing something that invades people'’s rights or won'’t advance human rights, then the commission ought to speak out and say so. Tell the public. Right before mid-term elections, we prepared to release our report. The White House panicked. They thought our announcement would sway voters. They told us, "Delay the report." Here is the first complete study ever made of the whole Federal Establishment, as regards, at least, to Civil Rights compliance and how we'’re delivering on what the law says we should do. It says the performance is pretty poor, always has been. They were concerned about the timing, and we didn'’t share their concern as to the political importance of the report. We are an independent agency. We generally do what seems best to us. If it'’s not independent, it is nothing. We don'’t wait to see if Congress likes it or the President likes it. We issue the report. The Notre Dame President rated President Nixon'’s performance as uneven. Mr. Nixon has praised Father Hesburgh'’s firm stand on campus unrest, but a White House source said today that this report is unfortunate, coming in the middle of the election campaign. All we'’re saying is that this represents the Constitution of the United States. It'’s high time we got serious across the board on implementing it. If this is not done, there'’s going to be many decades before we get anything like equal opportunity in this country. In a massive report today, the Civil Rights Commission declared that the federal government has failed to keep its own promises on equal rights and the commission blamed the failure on lack of presidential leadership, past and present. The reason Nixon appointed Hesburgh was that Father Hesburgh had this great credibility and that he would give him some cover. And Father Hesburgh, frankly, didn'’t fall into that trap. Nixon, he was shocked when Father Hesburgh stood up for the commission. He said today, "This commission has had it up to here with counties and communities that have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the US Constitution." Hesburgh said that neither the people nor the government is serious about equality. I think Father Hesburgh, to his credit, became the conscience of the country on civil rights. Mr. Morgan, I have read the report of the Civil Rights Commission, and I respectfully disagree with it. Where they say that this nation, the American people, do not have a commitment to the cause of civil rights, I believe that'’s an unfair charge. I do not question the sincerity of the members of the commission. I do not think they should question the sincerity of the great majority of the American people on this issue, particularly in view of the great progress that has been made. His leadership was just critical at that time. I... I drew inspiration from it as a young director at the office for Civil Rights. I always felt that Father Hesburgh had my back. Over the next two years, Nixon made a minor effort to enforce the law. Today, the commission issued a follow-up saying there had been some improvement in the last year, but only from poor to marginal. I thought we got through to him. But the 1972 election was approaching. His key to winning was the South. He chose to take a stand against school integration efforts. It'’s wrong for the white children. It'’s wrong for the black children. I made a promise to Nixon when taking this job: "If you violate Civil Rights, I'’m coming after you." Father Theodore Hesburgh said the federal government lacks commitment and aggression in carrying out its Civil Rights function. The whole government needs to be more committed to this. It needs to speak forcefully about it and act more forcefully, give more leadership from the top to the bottom. I can'’t make it any more clear than that. We need a systemic change. You'’re not going to solve it, one man isn'’t going to solve it. You can put the good Lord in as President of the United States, and this would be a... he wouldn'’t solve this problem if everybody wouldn'’t cooperate. In a final pushback against Nixon, I wrote a piece forThe New York Times two weeks before the election. I believe we are at a historic crossroads today, much more momentous than that of a century ago. We have witnessed enormous progress from minorities in America. But the whole upward thrust may be reversed in the days ahead. Throughout the nation, there'’s a great reluctance to move forward in this field. "No one likes to look at the heart of darkness. The real solutions are painful." Unless we have bombings and burnings and violence and disorder, people tend to go back to sleep again. Those who ignore history are condemned to repeat its mistakes. As the polls close across the country, the President will be re-elected in a landslide. That'’s what our trend now indicates. The President, re-elected by a landslide. The Reverend Theodore Hesburgh, President of Notre Dame University, resigned today as Chairman of the US Civil Rights Commission. Hesburgh said his resignation had been discussed with White House staff members, who told him the President wanted him to quit. For weeks, I avoided interview requests. Everyone wanted to know the story for my firing. I spent 15 years with the commission. What was there to say? I know why I was fired. In Nixon'’s shoes, I might have even done the same. But I took a stand for something, and I wasn'’t about to stop. He has been president of his University longer than any current president of any other university. He is Father Theodore M. Hesburgh. Hesburgh of Notre Dame. Notre Dame has made some revolutionary changes. He said to me, "How can it be a great university without women?" Under pressure from Hesburgh, Notre Dame went co-educational. It was very important to all. Notre Dame was a great university, and the way to make it better was to have women on campus. He was so proud that women were at Notre Dame. And I think it'’s high time we broaden the rights of women in this country and their participation in life at every level. We saw such a stark lack of diversity. Okay, something has to change, and we can always strive to do better. Notre Dame broke its long-standing opposition to post-season football games because the students wanted the money for minority scholarships. For the first time, the name of Father Theodore Hesburgh was missing from a Civil Rights Commission report. I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. I spoke up for a long time against the Vietnam War, and now I'’m working with the President'’s Clemency Board. There'’s a joke on campus. What is the difference between God and Father Hesburgh? God is everywhere. - Father Hesburgh is everywhere but Notre Dame. - Father Theodore Hesburgh. We'’re happy to welcome Father Hesburgh in take two. Father Hesburgh. Father Theodore Hesburgh... But being a president of a major university just hasn'’t given him enough to do. We went to him in the '’80s and asked him to help us on the nuclear threat and bring the nuclear issue to the public. We have to look at that globe and begin to think that'’s our world, that'’s all we'’ve got. Father Hesburgh, what can we do along this southern border? We did craft the Immigration Legislation and passed it. And that was largely by the leadership of Ted Hesburgh. I don'’t think any Americans want to see a military solution. I'’d say let'’s solve it while we can. There was a mission in El Salvador. President Reagan sent Hesburgh there to monitor the elections. I spent a third of my life doing things that are political, but they'’re political within the law, the system, to change the system, to change the law. And I'’m going to keep on doing it. Father Hesburgh was one of the giants of the Civil Rights movement. You'’re one of the most influential men in this country, aren'’t you? I don'’t know that, I... I... I don'’t think I'’m trying to be. He can enjoy the perks of his prestige, but rarely asks for them. So you'’d argue that your power is the power to persuade, the power to influence. I would think that'’s true, probably. A lot of it is just power of friendship. I mean, I know a lot of people that I'’ve worked with, and we respect each other and we work together well. Father Ted was probably her best friend. If she had... a question that was at all on his radar, she would go to him, because she trusted him. Ann Landers, advice-giver to millions, today told her readers that her 36-year marriage to Jules Lederer is ending in divorce. She said she felt she owed it to her more than 50 million readers to tell them herself, but said she will not tell them why, and begged them not to call or write and ask why. My parents'’ divorce, unlike a lot of divorces, was very public, not only because she was famous, but because of what she did. And my father was worried it would harm her career. Like, "Look who can'’t keep her marriage together." During the divorce, there was more than one trip to South Bend. He was very useful to her, because he said, "It'’s okay. You'’ll be okay." She was devastated. She called me one night saying, "Ted, I'’m supposed to know everything about everything, except my own life. I just need some guidance." She could talk to me about anything because she knew she was talking to a friend. Wouldn'’t you like to get married? - No. You wouldn'’t? I decided that question when I was 18 years old. You get an awful lot of attention, you'’re a very attractive man, you'’ve got a great sense of humor. You... I wonder whether being single is not, in many ways, often a distraction because of the well-meaning attention that you may get from women who genuinely admire you as a person. And perhaps that kind of attention and distraction would be diffused if you were... If there was a Mrs. Hesburgh. - Yeah. - I hope the question is understood. No, I understand. Maybe the thing that attracted Mother to him was his intellect and his integrity. I don'’t know what was underneath. There was just something between them. Little else has changed during our 44 years of friendship, but he is still the best-looking man in any room, and the smartest. I'’m going to sign off the same way that I have signed all my letters to Father Ted over nearly 45 years. And that is, "With love, but no kisses." It became a real love as friends love each other, and he loved her. People have asked me, um, could it have been more than a friendship? And I'’d... I'’d stake my life on the answer being no, because he was Father Ted. I mean, his... his beliefs meant the world to him. But I felt, being a priest, I could belong to everybody, and the price of belonging to everybody is probably not to belong to anybody. May the Body of Christ bring us all to life everlasting. When we think about Father Ted, I think you really cannot, uh, talk about him and any of the decisions he made without talking about his faith. This is a priest that said Mass every single day of his life, save one, celebrated Mass in the most arcane places. You'’ll hear it said of someone, "If he hadn'’t been a priest, he would'’ve been a CEO at a major bank." No one would have said that of Ted Hesburgh. Hesburgh was a priest in his cradle. You can'’t understand him apart from his commitment to his priesthood. Being a priest is a fairly isolated life. There'’s no family, there were no kids to raise, there was no wife to take care of. There were no grandkids. And so, it freed him to be a father to all people. He married my parents. He baptized me. He baptized all my siblings. He married all of us. So, he'’s got a huge family. And he did have the best of both worlds. Being a priest was something he always wanted. It was, I think, a true calling for him. If right now I had a real choice, I could be President or I could be a priest-- I couldn'’t be both, I know. I'’m sure, in this country, you couldn'’t be both. I wouldn'’t hesitate one second. I'’d be a priest. When Ted finished his 30th year, he went to the Board of Trustees and said, "I'’m ready to step down." They said, "We'’d like you to take another five-year term and prepare younger Holy Cross religious as your potential successor. I had never really thought about being President of Notre Dame until I was asked to play this role. Father Ted gave me two bits of advice. "Take care of your mother while she'’s still alive," which I did, and, "Be yourself," and that'’s what I tried to be. So I think the transition went very smoothly. He left the campus with Father Joyce, and it gave me and my new administration a chance to get off the ground. So, I'’m very thankful to him. And I tried to do the same when Father Jenkins took over. There was things that came up that he didn'’t agree with, but his answer was always the same. He said, "I had my shot, and I did what I had to do." One of the best-known American educators is leaving one of the most visible jobs in higher education in this country. He is Father Theodore Hesburgh, President of Notre Dame for 35 years. Just shy of his 70th birthday, Father Theodore Martin Hesburgh has spent exactly half of his life as Notre Dame'’s President. But we don'’t know where we'’re going from here and we don'’t know what we'’re going to do, but I can guarantee you there are a lot of battles yet to be won for justice. There are a lot of mountains yet to be climbed to overcome human ignorance and human prejudice, and at times, human stupidity. There are many songs yet to be sung in the name of joy and happy marriages and good families, and a dedication to all that'’s good and true and beautiful. In his retirement, he just shifted gears. He kept getting involved in all kinds of things. He still was on committees. He was still asked his opinion on things. It gave him an opportunity to spend more time at Land O'’Lakes. I didn'’t sense any frustration whatsoever. He just continued to stay involved. He accepted invitations to do things that most people his age would not have. So, I don'’t think Ted had it in him to just sit around idly and look out the window. I just don'’t think that was his personality type. He said he felt very important that both Ted and Ned, both of them should get out of town. Well, that'’s what really initiated the thought to get that motor home and drive around the United States. They load up an RV and towed a car behind the RV and went on a cross-country trip. Father Ted and Father Ned, simply put, were... were brothers. The thing that was amazing, 35 years together, and Ted said they never had an argument. It really changed Ted'’s life when Ned died. He really... He really lost, you might want to say, lost a brother. And I thank you, Ned, for just being my brother for so many years, for putting up with me when I needed putting up with. For just always being there. Although he didn'’t talk about it a lot, he felt it and he would share it with me. We developed a close relationship later on in life and he had a chance to spend a lot more time with the family and with our children, and became very close to them. He gets to know students. They are calling him Father Ted, and he'’s every student'’s grandfather. And he loved that. He'’s a famous man. People know him. And sometimes he talked about, you know, stuff that he did. Working with the Popes, the Presidents, but I don'’t know that man. The one I know is the priest. The loving Father. I cherished these years. I spent time with the people I loved most in this life. And with every year I stepped back, the world stepped forward, until finally something inspiring happened that I'’d feared I would never live to see. Is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible? Tonight is your answer. I remember getting a call from the White House. Father Jenkins has invited President Obama to campus. Should the President go? Surprisingly enough, he accepted. Isn'’t this great? The President is coming to Notre Dame. In some ways, he was coming to respect Father Hesburgh. I think President Obama was in great awe of Father Ted because he had prepared the way for the role that he could play as an individual. But then, there was a great firestorm. President Obama today steps squarely into the middle of what may be this country'’s deepest cultural, religious, and political divide: abortion. Murder! It is a murder without courage. It is a murder without conscience. Our campus was a bit besieged by protesters for about a month. There was a lot of anger, a lot of criticism of the University that it had sold out, that it had sold its soul. It took me by surprise, the intensity of the criticism, the national character of the coverage. Father Jenkins took a lot of crap. Boy, I tell you, they went at him, you know, headlines, you know. "How could you invite this horrible baby killer?" My mother saw this news coverage, so she called Father Ted and asked him, "How'’s my son doing? Did he do something wrong?" And Father Ted just assured her that this is a good thing. After that phone call, she didn'’t worry again. He was completely supportive of Father John Jenkins. Father Hesburgh, throughout his tenure at the University, always wanted to bring in different views, whether that was a Republican president or a Democratic president. Sometimes we get passionate about our own personal causes or the causes that we have great faith in, but he was always a person that could look at the wider picture, understanding that people of good will can disagree. It is not an issue that lends itself to compromise. But can he find a way to bridge the divide? It was... It was actually a beautiful day. The president came in, and... Tremendous excitement. Before Obama came out on stage, he asked to meet Father Hesburgh privately. Father Ted said to him, "I knew Martin Luther King. He would be very proud of you." And President Obama, I think, was clearly touched by that and said, "I don'’t think I would be here as President of the United States if it weren'’t for you and members of the Commission on Civil Rights." Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. We must find a way to live together as one human family. Unfortunately, finding that common ground is not easy. Some people say you'’re willing to listen to different opinions, you'’re not strong in your own belief. When, in fact, in the history of America, the true leadership has been the people who can bridge the two different ideologies. Father Hesburgh was somebody who could bring those people together and find ways that they could get in the same room, be respectful, and come to some kind of resolution. That'’s the only way in America to get things done. Father Hesburgh has long spoken of this institution as both a lighthouse and a crossroads, a lighthouse that stands apart, shining with the wisdom of the Catholic tradition, while the crossroads is where differences of culture and religion and conviction can coexist with friendship, civility, hospitality, and especially love. In gratitude for your visit, we would like to present you with a memento dear to the heart of Notre Dame. Before we present you with a copy of that photograph, Mr. President, if you and all here will forgive me for pointing, Father Ted is sitting behind the students in the first row. When I visited President Obama about a year or two later, it was hanging right off the Oval Office. That was a powerful moment, I think, for Father Hesburgh that touched a chord both in his heart and in his soul. I had been alerted by the people at Holy Cross House, our retirement health care facility, that Father Ted was probably in his last days. We went out to the tent that Ted had gotten attached to Holy Cross House so he could smoke his cigars and his cigar was sitting unlit in his fingers and I asked Ted, "What are you thinking about?" He said, "I'’m thinking about eternity." He said, "I'’m looking forward to the next stage of my life." When I started with him, he said he wanted to go to Mass every single day. "And I want you to make sure." For the last day, I get him dressed in the black. He looked so good. He says he'’s going to say Mass. And I'’m like, "Wow, I can'’t believe I'’m taking care of such a man." He started to go really about 9:30. Amivi came in the room and she proceeded to say the rosary in French, and he'’d respond in French. "Je vous salue Marie, pleine de grâce, Le Seigneur est avec vous, vous êtes bénie entre toutes les femmes." And it was just beautiful. "Sainte Marie, Mère de Dieu, priez pour nous, pauvres pécheurs, maintenant et à l'’heure de notre mort." After rosary was over, Ted said, "Amivi, what do I do now?" I said, "Well, now it'’s time to close your eyes and open it in Heaven." When I drove Father Hesburgh, and we went out St. Mary'’s Road, and he would have me stop the car, both in and out. We would stop the car and he would pray for his fellow priests and brothers buried in the cemetery. He'’d hit me in the shoulder and he'’d say, "Our last trip, you'’re bringing me here." After the funeral, we made the turn to go downhill by St. Mary'’s Road and there'’s hundreds, if not thousands of people lining that road. I can'’t think of a greater tribute to Father Ted than having the students that he loved a great deal lining the route to his final resting place. This was someone who was totally committed to the country, to his faith, and to what was right. He understood how to engage the larger culture. And it'’s more divided now and more coarse than ever, but boy, could we use a figure who understood how to transform it and also articulate both what'’s right and wrong with it. And we just don'’t have those kind of figures anymore. He could talk across differences, create a trust, create a mutual understanding. That'’s the kind of leader that we need today. It'’s the kind of leader Father Ted was. Father Ted'’s leadership has shown the world what Catholicism really is. I regard Father Ted Hesburgh as one of the few great men in history. Really, "one in a million" doesn'’t even say it properly. He was one of the special ones. I think we were all in awe of the finality of such an incredible life. I just owe him everything. What made him such an extraordinary figure was that he really didn'’t belong to any side. He belonged to the side of decency, he belonged to the side of a fundamental belief in... the redeemability of mankind. I think he felt he had done the job that God wanted him to do. A job well done. Let us all ponder the words of our good Lord, "Whatsoever you do to one of these, my least brethren, you did it to me."
