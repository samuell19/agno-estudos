- Silence is certainly important in a historical context. You get a sense of how the art of film developed. You watch this thing evolve. And so by the late 20s, what you have is a real artform. A great silent film in the right setting has as much ability to move an audience as any other movie with sound or any other artform, novel, painting. And just like seeing a great piece of art, you wanna go to a museum that presents it properly. The Silent Movie Theatre is like a museum in that sense. But more than that, it's a place where you really can have a transcendent film experience. - If you put this into a real movie, made this a movie movie. Nobody will believe this stuff. They'd all say it's gotta be fiction. - The Silent Movie Theatre was like a time machine. - It was a secretive place, sort of a house of secrets. - It's not some big fancy event with a full orchestra and a preserved print and it's a hundred bucks a seat. No, this is the Silent Movie Theatre. - It's special and it's perfect. It's the most Hollywood thing that you could be because on the surface it's all glamorous and art deco and wonderful and clean. And underneath there is a roiling dark noirish subtext. It's Sunset Boulevard, it's Hollywood Gothic. - This is a move theater. You know, the theater closes, the guy dies a horrible death from cancer. The best friend suddenly shows up out of nowhere. He reopens it with pizazz. Bad choices lead to this terrible thing. Murder and people go to prison and lives are ruined. The theater gets sold and is it gonna stay open or is it gonna close? - I started going to the Silent Movie Theater when I came, well the signs those wishes around 1950. That was the only place in town that I knew of that was showing silent films. - The first time I went to the Silent Movie Theatre was in December of 1961. And I went to see the King of Kings which was an annual tradition there. - The first time I went to the Silent Movie Theatre would have been around 1963 or 1964. And one Friday night I got my father to take me there. - The first time I went to the Silent Movie Theatre was 1971 and I saw "Birth of a Nation". - There was a whole page about the theater in Ezra Goodman's book, "The Fifty Year Decline "and Fall of Hollywood." That might have been where I first heard of the theater. - I was surprised when I saw an ad for the Silent Movie Theatre and I had no idea anything like that existed anywhere on the world. - I passed by one time and I was attracted to it and checked out to find what it was all about and when I did, I thought of going there. - I was fascinated. I went a number of times through the years to the theater. - In the early 70s, we didn't have DVDs. We didn't have VHS. - When we went to the Silent Movie Theatre we had this strange sensation that we were the only people in the world that had access to those movies. - I saw a lot of things there. The first Chaney film I saw there was called "Flesh and Blood". A 1922 independent film he did with Jack Mulhall. - I saw "The Mark of Zorro". - I saw "Intolerance" there. That was the first time I saw "Intolerance" in a complete form. - I probably saw those for the first time at his theater. - John Hampton created the theater and John Hampton was the theater. And only John Hampton and his wife Dorothy work at that theater. - My brother and I ran the show there at that time for kids and neighborhood every Friday night. And my love for silent films was nailed down tight at that point. - He took his new bride from Oklahoma, transplanted her here and set to work on his dream. - They built that theater which was built like a fortress. Poured concrete, this and that. Like a bunker, practically. - We started this theater, actually we opened it in February 25th, 1942. I'll never forget that date 'cause that was the day after Los Angeles was supposedly bombed by the Japanese. - The second he opened this place, he almost closed it 'cause I remember he was a conscientious objector to the war. - Willingly went to jail. He was an activist. He was a Quaker and didn't believe in the war. - And apparently was a, kind of a difficult case in prison, very much an anti war guy. - I would say about 42, was probably about the lowest ebb for appreciation of silent film. - They were considered extremely old fashioned then, even more so than now. - Remember, Marian Peckford felt that the advent of sound had made her films look so old fashioned, she seriously considered destroying them. - Silent Movie Theatre was not, at best it was like a neighborhood house in a small town. It didn't have that Grand Movie Palace aura about it at all. - Small and depressing. And very hard chairs. - I swear to god, it was painted the color of dried blood. - There was no adornment of any kind except the handpainted posters outside the theater. There were no pictures inside the theater. - Sometimes the lobby was a John Hampton art show. There is this beautiful lettering and photo work on the outside. And then you would go into the theater and it was always very dark and he had these dead flowers at the front of the theater. - It just seemed old, cramped and antiquated. But we didn't care. We went to this place and it was just a magical place for us because of what was on the screen. - You'd go into the theater and Hampton would play 78s. - He would play 40s swing. - As the scenes would change, he would move rapidly from one turntable to the other to have music. - And sometimes the music worked, sometimes the music didn't work. But it didn't matter. - It was still, in a sense, a live performance because it was different for every show 'cause you couldn't get those needles in the same groove. - He had some amazing affinity for this equipment and it was all taped together and patched together with wire and masking tape. He had a lot of masking tape on everything. - The program at Silent Movie Theatre was pretty much the same unless he had a very long film. - They start off with a Felix the Cat cartoon. And then they had a couple of comedy shorts. There was in those days, generally there was always a Chaplin film. - And then frequently they'll have a serial. - I think he had "Plunder" with Pearl White and the "Adventures of Tarzan" with Elma Winkin. - Hampton had this humongous collection. What this guy had was unbelievable. - There were a number of films that John ran that you literally couldn't see anywhere else. - You'd go there and you'd go away with this feeling of finding buried treasure. - Most of what John ran were films that had been distributed through the Kodascope Library and the Bell and Howe library and the Universal show at home library in the 20s and 30s. - It's especially fortunate because Universal threw out or one of their executives had decided to throw out their entire silent inventory in the 1940s. So many of the Universal pictures only survived through 16 millimeter prints. And this includes big important movies like "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" with Chaney. - Hampton never ran anything other than public domain films. - He ran "The Covered Wagon" and Paramount did go after him. - It was quite famous at the time. He had shown Covered Wagon, which was a film which was in copyright. And Paramount came down on them like a ton of bricks. - Mr. Hampton had this strange duty to the theater but he also had a duty to posterity. He was conscious of the fact that he was the only guy out there who's restoring a lot of these films. - He would get a print of a film and let's say three quarters of the film was in good shape. And the other quarter part wasn't. He would wind up, wheeling and dealing and he'd get the better last quarter part of the film and he'd splice it together. - He had a Sydney Chaplin film that he was editing together from two different prints he'd got from different sources. And he had no idea why he kept saying I don't know why I'm doing this. Nobody wants to see Sydney Chaplin. There's no notice in this films. And then he answers his own question. He said, if I don't do it, no one will. - You can always tell a Hampton restoration, one of his 16 millimeter prints because he favored a Bell & Howell diagonal splicer intended to give you a strong splice in 16 millimeter. - But it goes right across the picture. - He would buy sound prints of silence and he would perforate them so that he could run them on his silent projectors. - These perforations were very ragged as I recall. They weren't very good. But they got the job done. - On the other hand, there wasn't a textbook for restoring film. There were people that were doing it, but he was way ahead of his time I think in the concept of trying to find materials to create the best and most complete prints. You'll see things in a Hampton print that you won't see on any other print. But you're also gonna see the, you know, the diagonal splice come through the projector. It's just the tradeoff. - You couldn't really talk to Hampton about anything really more than the operation of the Silent Movie Theatre and what he was showing. - Something in him resonated deeply about the value of silent films. - He had to clear off some film cans for me to have a place to sit. And we sat there and he never looked up from editing the film the whole time. I don't think he ever could tell you what I looked like. - He was so focused on his work that when he built the place he built it with a little trapdoor in the projection booth. So that rather than stop working, Dorothy could feed him food from the upstairs where the kitchen was down through the hole into the booth. - The week before Christmas he'd run "King of Kings" and then he'd go take off for a week or two for vacation. And that was the only time that he wasn't in that booth splicing film or running film. - And they had their cause and that's what they devoted their lives to. Heroically, frankly. - Offhand, I don't remember what they were charging 65 cents or a dollar. - Often for a crowd of maybe seven to 14 people. - I don't think they did it to make a lot of money. They did it to pay the light bills and keep the doors open. And they lived in the building as well. - I mean you had to have had a passion to build a theater, to live upstairs. I don't know what it was like up there. But I assumed it was pretty small. - I felt so privileged to be upstairs. And even though there's no room for me. There were reels of film piled everywhere and you couldn't see how he even knew where anything was. - He was very devoted to the silent picture to my way of thinking, kind of extreme extent. - I think it was probably mostly his obsession. And maybe his wife Dorothy was sort of secondary to that. I think she was working for his dreams a lot of the time. And my impression that hers were probably perhaps withering. - She was just a very supportive wife and she was kind of in awe of John. She just thought he was the greatest guy in the world. It would have been very intriguing to be around John Hampton at the time of the sound transition when he was in his late teens because he obviously loved silent pictures. And sound pictures won and it must have been tough on him. - Actually I was up there one time when he was running a sound film for himself. A sound film? - Yeah, he was running a sound film in the theater. It seemed very strange. - I would say that John and Dorothy were private people. I don't say that in a bad way. You know, they were unassuming. - John and Dorothy were difficult to know. - I got to know the Hamptons about as well as I think anybody could at that time which was not very much. You got the feeling that these people woke up in the morning and their lives were running that theater night and day. - On a couple occasions, I saw them on a bus heading toward downtown Los Angeles and I was told by John that he was going to visit his son who was in a hospital. - She had wanted a baby for a long time. He was born with Down Syndrome. He was put in a hospital. And I believe he died. - That has got to have been very tragic for them and then perhaps the theater was an escape. - In the photographs, they look when they're with the kid I mean especially Dorothy looks so happy. She wants this. - And then, one day came, the Hamptons went on a vacation and they just never quite somehow got around to reopening. - It was always, we're gonna reopen sometime soon and sometime soon stretched to six months and a year and ultimately something like 10 years. - By the early 80s, everybody's putting all those films that you used to see at Silent Movie Theatre on VHS. And then in 1979 Kevin Brownlow's Hollywood Series is finally syndicated. Now I've seen stuff I've never seen. I've kind of graduated from film history 101 of the Hamptons and now I'm into graduate level Kevin Brownlow silent films. - The Hamptons at the time had an offer to sell the collection and close down as I understand it to inventory their collection, get ready to sell it for a substantial amount of money. - Well I heard through the grapevine that David Packard had bought that collection. When you sell things off, it's perhaps an indication that you're not as completely obsessed as you were. - They just kind of disappeared, faded out. You know, kind of like Norma Desmond in a way. - And then the next thing one heard is that John was ill and then really ill. - It must have attributed this man's ill health that he was sitting there all day breathing all these different chemicals. He was mixing them in the bathroom. - Whether John Hampton really died as a result of what he breathed, who can say? Who can say? He lived to be 80. - Then you know, then John died. And Dorothy lived on upstairs in their little apartment upstairs. - Well obviously when I heard that I thought well that's the final blow. That's the end of the theater. - It just kind of seemed to, was going to die a quiet death. - It was part of my past and I kept needing to revisit. You know, we all have these regrets. I wish I had gone to the Silent Movie Theatre a couple times before it closed down and just visit it one more time in the form that I knew it. ♪ They think that I'm bashful ♪ But I'm flighty just the same ♪ ♪ It's this dress I wear that makes them think I'm slow ♪ ♪ They think I haven't cut my wisdom tooth ♪ ♪ But oh boy if they only knew the truth ♪ - I drove down Fairfax one day and they were painting it. There were people out front putting a fresh coat of paint on it and I went oh my goodness, it's coming back to life. - Suddenly I realized there's this new person, Larry Austin who suddenly is going to open the theater again. I said, couldn't believe it. - Well, I've been running silent films for about four years before this at a church out in the valley. And Hampton of course knew about this and he's very much interested in the project I was doing. Unfortunately his health never allowed him to come to see what I was doing, but, he knew I always had this interest. And when he passed away, I talked to Dorothy about reopening the theater. And she thought it was a good idea so it took us about five months to get the place in shape again. - He had been going to the theater for a long, long time. He did know the Hamptons. He was in a position, because he was known by them to talk Dorothy into letting him reopen the theater. - And we reopened on January 18th, 1991 with the film "King of Kings". - That was great! I had a great time and I started going more and more often. - It was 1991, I moved to Los Angeles. Around the corner, like a few blocks from where I lived there was this Silent Movie Theatre and I thought wow, how amazing is this. - A friend of mine said you know, have you been to this place, the Silent Movie Theatre on Fairfax? - That was my Friday night. I used to walk over the Silent Movie Theatre and watch these films and it was magic to me. - I was blown away by the first experience and also impressed by the proprietor who plays. One Lawrence Austin. - He really did a great number on the theater. I mean the theater really came to life. - I was amazed what he had done with it. He made it into a beautiful little jewel box. - Like a little toy theater. Like a little dream theater. Just the right size, you know. Couple hundred seats. - Larry put the right curtain on the theater which is still there. - Really, really wonderful blowups of major silent stars. - The wooden seats were still freaking uncomfortable. He did finally pad the bottom parts. - Lawrence indicated that he was very close to the Hamptons. - He felt they were like family. They had known each other for years, he said and I'd seen snapshots of them taking trips together. - He certainly seemed to have a close bond with Dorothy. - Lawrence would give the person the ticket and not three feet away, there'd be Dorothy ripping the ticket in half. It was like the space of this much. - She smile, she glowed, she right where regarded it as a miracle. - Larry played them all but we tried to put on the best films that we could. And my husband spent his life collecting and refurbishing, you know. - Clearly he was very fond of Dorothy. But he would say things like, well John. People don't know John. John had a very dark side. I kind of think it might had just been as innocent as running some porn reels for his own pleasure. - I got to work one day and Lawrence was out on the back patio with a garbage can with a pencil stuck through the reels and literally pulling the stuff, this film off these reels into the garbage can. And I'm like what are you doing? He says, oh there's all these films. It's pornography, you want some pornography? - It might have been hardcore, but it was antique. Another time though, we were inventoring the film at the back of the film vault. And he gets to one and he says write down this one, A224XXX horse. And he sets it down. - Larry would tell me that John would be collecting large amounts of pornography, as he was anti-pornography. And he would do marches and things like that. Then upstairs, Dorothy would be in bed watching evangelists on the television. - Lawrence was absolutely enamored of silent films. He would often get the names and dates wrong when he was relaying information to the audience. Because that wasn't the most important thing to Lawrence. - There must have been something more than just let's say promoting himself when he was running the theater. - He loved to play the role of the person who represented the Silent Movie Theatre. He was extremely proud of that role. - I was working at the theater the night that the LA riots started. Larry continued to run the theater through the riots. He was running Laurel and Hardy movies during the Los Angeles riots. Couldn't understand why Larry wouldn't just close the theater. But again it was part of being Larry Austin was to just damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead. - As a silent film buff, with Larry running it in the first four to five years up to about 95, he really went all out to try and show things. - He didn't really care if five people showed up or 15 or 200. Pretty much the midweek show was where you'd see the real sort of rarities. - And birth, it takes a lot of worth and considering so many films gone by, it challenge you to what kind of programs you can put on and change the variation so that you'll keep the audience interest in the program. - Larry Austin would screen as many rare features as he can get his hands on. "The Black Pirate", "Love Sosoniaw", Sadie Thompson. - He, unlike John Hampton would get films from various sources, not just what was at the theater. - He was able to get a lot of MGM silent films that never got shown. Well we got to see a lot of that stuff. - There were never a lot of people there except on comedy nights. - Laurel and Hardy weekend, all star comedy or Chaplin. 'Cause the comedies really sort of drew the most in. - Larry put certain emphasis on comedy. He called his company, I guess, the Shape of Laughter productions. - He showed a lot of Keaton. Keaton had a resurgence because of Larry, literally. - That was the only time you would ever see any kind of real line out this theater. - There were still films from John Hampton's collection at the theater. And that helped a lot because we could draw on those. - Naturally, he was very protective of this. He really didn't want other collectors to know what was in the collection. It's the holy grail, you know, finding out, getting a list of what the films were actually in the collection. And the rumors were flying about what he actually had and many of them, perpetuated by Lawrence himself who would say oh yeah, we have that. We have that and someday I'll show it. And of course he never did. - One of the nights we ran, "The Eagle" which was a real strong Valentino picture. Larry brought out this print and I printed it up and did some rehearsal with it. And it was pretty fuzzy, pretty dupey and I said to Larry, well it's not very good quality. And Larry went back into the vaults and brought out another print. So I printed up this print and it looked about the same. So I said to Larry, this is not better really, Larry. Larry went back into the vault again, brought out a third print. It was gorgeous. - I remember one time I get this phone call from him and he says "You're never gonna guess what I found." I said, "What?" "Well I've been going through these cans that Hampton had "and checking his notes." And he goes "There's some footage from Chaney's Thunder." which was Chaney's last silent film which has been considered lost. I said "You're kidding." He goes. "No." He says "Come down tomorrow, I'll show it for you." - I didn't care if it was nerdy to spend my Friday nights in the Silent Movie Theatre. I was very happy there. - It was the best time of my life, that two and a half years I was there, really with all the ups and downs. - Once everything settled in and the lights went down and I got to sit in the back row finally and just watch, and it was fantastic. Silent films are not meant to be seen silent. Silent films are meant to be seen with music. And Lawrence knew this. - You'd have players like Bob Mitchell, the legendary Bob Mitchell. - The first night I came here, they were showing "Hands Up". And I had played for that in 1925 at the Strand Theater. And I remember it vividly. - Dayward Carter, of the top three silent film accompanists of all time. - Dean Mora started playing for Larry. - I actually started on piano. Lawrence had said "We'll start you on a movie "that we're showing for a UCLA film class. "It'll be on piano and it'll be pretty easy." And it turned out to be "Birth of a Nation." It's only three hours long. - First thing, they called me, said that can you play "Pomp and Circumstance"? I said yes I can play it in all 12 keys. - He would open each show with "Pomp and Circumstance" which I guess he had heard that Sid Grauman had himself piped into the Grauman's Chinese. - Oh my god, what is he doing? - It was Larry, it was part of the show, you know? - This worked. Every time I start up "Pomp and Circumstance" audience would go and applause. So he knew his showbusiness anyhow. - Tonight we're gonna start the program with "Felix the Cat". - He was utterly charming and weird. - He would tell you how he'd preserve the films and how he was running films in 35 millimeter when in fact they were 16 millimeter. - He would often laugh. And people really were kind of laughing at him but he would laugh also. And the whole thing had kind of a rather friendly vibe about it. - He seemed to have this infectious love of the films that he was showing. I caught that right away and I loved this guy. And I love the theater and I love what he was doing. - And Lawrence did make an evening out of it. It was something that was I think very special. - And for six dollars, you could come hear these incredible players play and bring these antiques to life. - The movie started with all these things to support the film. Vaudeville and music. And that gradually went away and movies just became an automated sort of thing. Just a machine running. Larry was gonna bring back a human touch. - He'd say "so on with the show" and he'd walk back up and he'd start. He'd get up in the theater and the curtains would part. Larry, what can you say about Larry? There's a lot you can say about Larry. - Larry was a very interesting person. He could be a lot of fun. - Larger than life in many ways. He was very full of life. He was somebody that I look forward to seeing, you know, everyday. - I think if you looked up the word dichotomy you'd see Larry Austin's picture. - Lawrence was a Mormon. And would often sort of sponsor events at the Mormon church. - He loved his mother. I mean what his mama said was law. Mama hated FDR and Larry hated FDR. He was just a real, real dyed in the wool republican. - Larry and I developed a very nice relationship. - Our friendship was built around collecting films and "Murder She Wrote." And after "Murder She Wrote" would be over, the phone would ring and it'll be Larry talking about this scene or that scene. - I don't wanna deal to heavily in stereotypes. I of all people, there you go, Larry like myself, I think is pretty easy to figure out that we're gay. - Don't wanna say I took it for granted but I assumed it. - He was very defensive about being gay. Very uptight about that. - He pretended in fact that he was straight. Talking about globetrotting with lady friends. Oh, what a time we had. - He was always upfront. He would talk about his encounters, his boyfriends. - Why he pretended to be straight in my presence, I never understood. I mean, he was of another time. - There are some reasons why I enjoy doing this work. One of them is that my parents were in the business. My mother worked for the mail and my father was an actor. - Larry did start talking about his parents quite a lot. - And he would tell these wonderful stories about his childhood. - His father was actor William Austin of probably most famous for his role in the film "It." - His mom made C.B. Demille's BVDs. That was always his famous point. - And then his uncle was Albert Austin who is in a lot of the Chaplin films especially the Chaplin mutuals. He's got in those films a big mustache. - He would talk about walking with his uncle on the lot. And he was attacked by Rin Tin Tin and he took whatever was in his hand and he whacked him right over the snout. None of that was true. - It was more or less common knowledge that he had been in prison, that he wasn't the son of William Austin, that his mother hadn't worked for Cecil B. Demille. - These were jawdroppers. The whole thing was a jawdropper. But it didn't affect my feeling for him. - Stories came out later. His father was a macho sailor, didn't care for his son who played with dolls instead of army men et cetera et cetera, that kind of stuff. - You know, this is Hollywood. We all despise but also love a conman. Anybody who can get by on their wits alone and Lawrence was a guy who can get by on his wits. - I mean I had sort of this image of him that's this coyote-esque windmill chaser and superhero who was offering this experience to me and the minions you know, week after week. I got in there and he was a very difficult individual to work for. - He wasn't a saint and he wasn't a devil. Although there are some people that probably think that. Lawrence was one of these people who strove for respectability or outward respectability. - He was not exactly the most honest person in the world. - He would rarely tell the truth when a lie would suffice. And I was often asked to back him up in his lie and how much was buried. At the same time, lavish gifts on people that he decided to arbitrarily and he was very generous with me. - The whole movie world that was related to silent pictures and that sort of thing was clearly aware of Larry's activities and his skilfulness at being minion. - He wanted to be the only guy who was bringing silence to the modern world. - Cinecon, which meets every Labor Day and he would try to outshine them. - Cinecon is an organization that puts on a festival every year, fantastic rarities such as early silent films. - Cinecon brought out the perverse in Larry. - He would jealously save his best material for the week that Cinecon was going. - I never was involved in the feud. I always thought it was kind of stupid. I mean the biggest thing you're gonna get out of this is being the king of silent movies. And nobody cares, you know, in the greater scheme of things. - That was Larry's take on it. He was out there to cut the competition and steal audiences if he could. - Almost at this very time I met Larry I met James Van Sickle. - A friend of Larry's who corresponded with people in prison, brought him out. He had just gotten out and was trying to help him. - Every time that Larry would be in the room with James, the few times that I saw them together, you could just see it in his eyes that he was hanging on every word that James had said. - James had sort of wormed his way into a very important position, if ill-defined. - There were times when I would run errands and those errands were paying James' cable bill. Or paying overdue utility bills for James. - James in his more in shape days had been a Hollywood Hustler. - He would often use this, you know "in my wilder days" statement, talk about his gay bashing days. - Was he gay? I didn't think so. - They had got into an argument one night and James had taken the telephone cord and wrapped it around Larry's throat and tried to kill him. - There were a number of nights where I was asked to stay late. Lawrence would say "well tell James that you, "You can't come in tomorrow and do your work "so you have to stay late tonight to do it "because he's in one of his moods "and I'd really rather there was somebody here." - The other side of this is Larry then, gets to put back into prison. While James is back in prison, he buys and sends him a color television, sends him a case of oysters and other foods that he likes. Of course he gets out of prison, he's back in Larry's life again. - I warned him once, I had the nerve to suggest at one point that he needed to be afraid. Yet he kept taking him back. And others have warned him, he kept taking him back. - The best way you can describe the relationship is battered wife syndrome. And Larry's the battered wife. - I was sort of keeping a watchful eye at that point and I felt that maybe if I was diligent that maybe I could somehow intervene because of course the theater was everything and James was a threat to that. - I never could figure out how you could possibly keep that place running, you know, and even break even. Much less make a profit and it turns out, he probably didn't. - Lawrence had that glorious situation at the theater where money was not a major concern. He lived upstairs. He took one vacation a year, kept his gold Cadillac with the license plate Mr. Silent or M. Silent. - He was buying things and he bought James a truck. - You know the old saying play your cards close to the vest? Larry had him inside his vest. - This sort of incredible rumor mill that surrounded the theater, Lawrence. - Larry was a little mysterious. - Some of these stories were true, others were false. Others I'm still not sure about. - There were rumors that odd events were going on there. You know, sex with maybe hired people. - He also did some copying of things that were really not on the up and up. - He would rent films from some of the studios and he would backdoor it out to the lab to get a negative made for bootleg prints. - According to Larry, they were extra prints that John Hampton had. - The best way to describe this is that a film would play at the Silent Movie Theatre and then three or four weeks later, you'd get a call saying "Do you want a print of such and such?" - At the time, I was not privy to any detail. I was however sent on these sketchy clandestine errands for instance at two o'clock there would be a guy pulling into the parking lot of Bob's Big Boy in Burbank. He'll be driving a blue pinto. Don't talk to him. Just give him this film and this envelope and he'll give you an envelope and bring it back. Lawrence was really sort of from a proud tradition of thieving materials that very few people care about but certain people are passionate enough to steal for. - He was a film collector. And when you get into the realm of film collecting you get into this controversial area. - Half the films in the archive wouldn't be there if over the years and decades, film collectors, people who saw these films as something special, had begged, borrowed, stolen then whatever they had to do from whatever source. - I don't think that was a cool thing for Larry to do. But I don't think he, it was as much of a stretch for him to justify any kind of behavior, whether it would be embezzling or illegal copying of prints, you know. I just think that he was an outlaw in a way. - There was definitely a greed factor there. He liked money. And he looked for reasons to get it. But he was always very selective about who and how. - John Hampton and Dorothy had built up a large collection of posters and stills and trade magazines. And Lawrence was busy using surrogates to sell all that material to collectors. - He didn't have things. He didn't know how to get them. He embezzled money. He was an opportunity, certainly I can relate since my dream was to someday run the Silent Movie Theatre. I'm sure when he was going there, friends with the Hamptons, someday he wanted to be the person that did this. - Now there's always been the implications that he took a lot of money out of Dorothy's pocket to get it done, I don't know. - You know the odd thing is, Lawrence didn't introduce me to Dorothy as one of the owners of the theater. - I mean there are accusations that at the end he didn't treat her like he should have. He wasn't generous enough with her. I didn't necessarily see this firsthand but she seemed delighted that he had reopened the theater. - I don't think any of us were aware until much later that he had essentially tricked her out of it by getting her to sign a quick claim deed. - Larry at one time asked me to be a witness to the changing of Dorothy's will. So I got there and he brought the paperwork out and I said "Where's Dorothy?" - He said "Well, nobody sees Dorothy anymore." - I said "Well, Larry, I can't witness a signature "that I didn't see Dorothy sign." - I knew her and she was not senile. And she knew what was going on. And I think that she wanted Larry to have the theater because it kept John Hampton's work alive. - People have said Larry took advantage of Dorothy. I don't know about how true any of this is. And I don't give a damn. Because I never saw Dorothy more radiantly happy ever in the whole time I knew her as when Larry reopened that theater. - Once a year, Lawrence was invited to be a guest in Japan. Lawrence would take a player along with him and oddly enough, his hairdresser. - He was just thrilled. He was just thrilled to go. And I'm sure he's thrilled to get back 'cause he loved his cats so much. And he loved his theater. - Probably the thing that Lawrence was most connected to in the world besides the theater was his beloved cat that he gave the name Sir Purity. - Beautiful cat, long hair. - He'd always said that when he died he wanted Sir Purity put to sleep and rested on his chest in his crossed arms as he was lowered into the ground. - He used to hug this cat and he used to say "He knows nothing of the evils of the outside world. "He is safe here, he will always be safe "here in this theater." - James was able to use the cat because he knew that the cat was an Achilles heel for Lawrence. He would often sort of make threats against Sir Purity to get leverage with Lawrence. - He called me one night and said "Well James pulled a Trall Rodbury on me. - A phone call came through and it was Lawrence and he said "Oh you'll never imagine what just happened. "James came in with these two guys "and they threatened to throw me down the stairs "if I didn't give them all the money in the place. "I called the police, police are on their way." Well I saw them out side, I saw them out front. I saw them acting very suspiciously. Do you want me to come back and talk to the police? " No, no, no, don't come back, don't get involved. "I'll talk to the police "and I'm having the locks changed today. "We won't see James here again." - Later in the day James called and said you know, they put him up to it. - I said well boy, James sounds pretty dangerous, you know. He said "Well I've gotten a restraining order against him." - He did get a cellphone so he had a cellphone by the bed in case he had to call the police. Because at that point he did fear for his life. - So for the next several months, it was Lawrence and I. I became a lot more involved in every aspect of running the place. I was loving it. I mean I was learning new stuff every day. Really I felt like I was being groomed. I still think it was the greatest time of my life. Of course, it couldn't last. - By 96, he was still showing some interesting stuff but not as much. I had heard he was thinking of pulling the pin, selling the theater or just closing the theater within a couple of years. - The phone rang in the lobby during a show. And I picked up the phone and next, somebody on the other end asked in a gruff voice, "Is Lawrence Austin there?" And I knew instantaneously that it was James and my heart froze. And I said "He's not available." And James said "You know who this is, don't you?" - That was the point that I started getting really scared for Larry. I mean I'm really getting scared. - And the next day I came in and the first thing I did was I told Lawrence I had to leave. He acted very strangely and he said "Oh well, fine", he said, "Well we don't need you here. "We've been here a long time and we'll be here "long after you're gone." - Larry said to me "Oh, I'm not afraid. "I'm not afraid", he said. "God will protect me." - Every week he'd call and he'd say "I know you miss this place. "You're not gonna be able to stay away." He was right. Boy, I wish I could change reality. But you know, - The feature that was gonna be shown was "Sunrise." - As usual, Lawrence started out with his march down the aisle to "Pomp and Circumstance". - One of those standard nights. - That night I came here to see "Sunrise." - First it opened with Felix the Cat goes hungry. And the second short that run was called "The Golf Bug" with Monty Banks. The next thing I notice is somebody has come in and sat down at the end seat. "School Days" comes on. He abruptly gets up and goes. I mean abruptly. - And as I'm coming out of the bathroom, it was only like a minute or two later, - All of a sudden there was this enormous noise. - Bam! - What I thought were firecrackers. - And then there were two more, bam, bam. - And I remember this woman walking out and I remember jumping on her to keep her down. - I can remember thinking to myself "What the fuck was that?" - And I heard you know, bam, another one. - Then I stopped playing. - Dean Mora jumps up immediately from his bench. - And at that point I see someone bursting through the curtains on the other aisle. - And it's my former seatmate there. - Running down and starts shooting. - It's this very theatrical move on his part. - Bang, bam. And I just saw like orange flame. - The gunman stopped shooting and I heard him go out the door. At that point, I ran into the lobby and saw the candy counter girl standing there and crying. At that point I knew, something terribly wrong happened. And that's when I looked over the counter of the snack bar and saw Lawrence was shot. - The first thing I spot is Mary Giles, the concessions girl, she was lying on the ground with her knees drawn up. She had a white t-shirt on. There's red in the front of her t-shirt. - I remember trying to help Mary who was bleeding, a lot. - Looked over the candy counter and there's Lawrence's body. - It was on his right side. And there was this oval, I mean like this. - First of all, there was a hole where his right eye had been. - And I remember thinking I didn't realize that the human body had so much blood in it. Because there was just blood everywhere. - The phone rang and it was Dean calling. I just said, "You know, it was James, wasn't it?" And he said "No, no." - Received a phone call that there had been a homicide in Hollywood Division. And it was possibly going to be a double homicide. - And there was a lot of people there. A lot of crowd of people. The street was all blocked off with police cars and yellow tape. - We're informed that Mary had been transported to the hospital in extremely critical condition with a gunshot wound to the chest she sustained at point blank range. - We went down to talk to Mary. We still to this day honestly do not know how she survived. And the bullet somehow went around her ribcage. - There were a few things that initially didn't add up. Generally when someone comes in for a robbery they're gonna take everything that they can. - The money was still there which was strange. - Most people that commit a robbery are not going to run out where they could be seen and cause any kind of attention to be brought to themselves. - The night after Austin was shot, I drove by the theater and there was like a candlelight vigil outside. There were a dozen candles burning, flickering out there. And people had put up all these notes on the wall that said I came here when I was 14 or I came here when I was 23. Really personal experiences that were like telling the world or anybody who wandered by what the theater meant to them. They just started crying. This mass, spontaneous outpouring of love for this building which I took as love for John Hampton's creation but it was also for, thank you Mr. Austin for bringing it back to us. - Our first clue that was making us believe that something wasn't exactly right, this wasn't a robbery. A handwritten will that just didn't look right. - James claimed he owned the theater because he had the will. Handwritten will on a cocktail napkin supposedly scribbled by Lawrence at an airport. - Lawrence Austin who hated flying, traveling to Japan. He said "Hey if something happened to either one of us, "you know, we should make sure we take care "of the business." - Couple of days after the murder, and he says oh, when they find that will, I'm in trouble. - The more information we got about James, the more we started keying on, he was more involved in this. - Why? I mean why would someone do this, okay? And there's really no explanation. I mean think about it. - We initially found that he had been on parole and that he had been convicted of an attempted murder. - He had been in prison for beating a gay man, an older gay man that he had kind of befriended. And so that was kind of similar to what we had here. - Mr. Van Sickle would never admit to being homosexual, only saying that he was a hustler and he did what he had to do survive and to make money. - Sex always comes up in Hollywood cases. I don't care what it is. You know, a guy could get hit by a motorcycle on Mohol and somehow sex gets into it. - He advises that because of the shady dealings that Mr. Austin had had over the years, he had more than likely had a number of people who would be not so displeased if they would have seen him dead. He covered everyone from the Yakuza all the way down to the homeless people that live down the alley. - I've heard that Larry had people that disliked him but I'd never classify them as enemies. They were just collectors, people that maybe he screwed. I mean in a monetary way. - Certainly Mr. Austin was no angel. I think we were pretty clear on that in our investigation. Not a whole lot there that would warrant a contract hit though. We kind of got a whole different dimension of Mr. Van Sickle at this point. It became very clear to us that he was very manipulative. A couple of things that came out, he didn't like me at all. But he did like Detective Miller. - Because I had more in common with him. I was from the Midwest, I was in the Marines, I was white. I played like I understood. - I was very straightforward with James, let him know right upfront that since we, there were a number of people that we hadn't eliminated as suspects, and I informed him that he was on that list. He was pretty close to the top, and working his way up. - What's kind of interesting is at the funeral, James was acting very distant. Yet he drove up in Larry's Cadillac. - Michael and I went to Lawrence's funeral. And it was all very odd. - There's all these people at his gravesite and I feel just, I was so moved that people did appreciate what he was doing and they loved him. - Immediately upon completion of the service, he came over to me and started pumping me for information. Had I spoken to the police, he said, oh. Did you say anything to the cops because, man they were really sweating me down. - Well then we got Moreland. The secret service actually called us about Moreland and he had information. He had met Van Sickle at a party in south L.A. And he said he thought it was strange that this white boy was down at the hood. - He apparently approached some Compton gang members about doing a contact killing. And they were willing to take the money but they were totally turned off by his lack of professionalism. Apparently there are certain protocols that he violated in the world of hitmen. - And we met with Moreland. And he started giving us information that made sense to us. He described the place. - We're pretty sure at some point that they dry ran it. We're pretty sure that at some point they had discussed the viability of them taking on the contract. - It's like the line out of Alice in Wonderland. Curiouser and curiouser as we go down the rabbit hole. - Since there had been so much media interest in the case, we're contacted by the producers of America's Most Wanted. - And this is where we got very lucky. - They sent out Jeannie Borland to do a composite of the shooter. - And when she was finished, she had this composite that really looked like a person. - So we blasted that out to the media and we went live with that. Very shortly thereafter, we're contacted by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and they informed us that an informant had come forward. - He said you know that he was out with a friend, Christian Rodriguez and another friend. And he had the paper. And this composite was on the front page. And he said, god this looks just like you. And Rodriguez said in return "They'll never make me "off of that picture." - This is someone that you would never expect coming from where he came from would be involved in this type of activity but then we learned of his life situation where he had just had a baby. He was a teenager. And he had no visible means of support, no desire to support himself. - We finally decided, okay, what we need now is we're gonna take both of these guys down as quickly as we can, but we want Van Sickle first. So we placed him on round the clock surveillance, 24 hours a day with our Special Investigations Section, it was known as SIS. - And we said okay, we're gonna get Moreland to meet with Van Sickle, we're gonna have him wired. - And followed him all the way back to his residence in Lakewood. I had prestaged Mr. Moreland at the residence in Lakewood so he can confront James when he arrived at his residence. - And I mean Moreland did a fantastic job. He like jumps out in front of him, and "Hey motherfucker. "What you doing coming into the hood "and the hood gets none of this money "and you're paying it to this Mexican from the eastside?" - He was able to elicit statements from Mr. Van Sickle about how the deal was made with Rodriguez and discussed how he was gonna eliminate the hitman. And he wanted to know if he knew anyone that would be able to take that job on. - So as soon as they broke off, our units took Van Sickle down in his truck and arrested him. And then we went over to Rodriguez's place. We had it staked out. - There was a short pursuit in the city of Southgate and he was taken into custody. - He immediately, as soon as we got him back to the station, confessed. - I couldn't drive down Fairfax. I couldn't drive by the theater, it was too heartbreaking. I mean I was trying to distance myself emotionally from the situation. Because not only had I lost my friend. But there was the tragedy of the loss of the theater to Los Angeles. I was never again, I thought, going to be able to go back there. - The actual trial for Christian Rodriguez, the guy who pulled the trigger, was about three days. - They finally came in with the verdict. And they had two juries. One for Rodriguez and one for James. So they read it, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty. - Van Sickle did not get the death penalty. - He has no chance of ever getting out of prison without, absent of escape. - They are where they are. And will be until they're buried. - There was Lawrence's family who thought they should inherit the theater. And there was the Hampton family appeared and made the case that Lawrence had swindled the theater. Soon, a deal was worked out that basically the Hampton family and the Austin family agreed to sell the theater and all of the films. With that money, they would pay for Dorothy's care until she died. At which point they would divide the amount between the two families. - The theater was gone. Specially when they had the auction. - It was pretty clear that there were institutions and other more serious collectors who had specific things in mind. But no matter what you bid, you weren't gonna win it. - I wanted that clip of "Thunder". That needed to be preserved. I tell you, that can get mighty dangerous. And it turned out I was bidding against a well heeled private collector. Thank god my wife wasn't with me. And it got up to 4,000 dollars. And I won the bid. - Once the film collection was auctioned off at Butterfield and Butterfield, it was to my mind completely over. The theater possessing that library of films was the only way that it was going to continue to function like it did. ♪ Pale hands I loved ♪ Beside the shining moon where ♪ ♪ Where are you now who lies beneath ♪ ♪ Your spell ♪ Who do you lean on ♪ Rapture's road way far ♪ Before you wag on ♪ I say meeting farewell ♪ Before you wag on ♪ I stand faring farewell - It had a second rebirth. This is now officially the end. It can't come back again for a third time. So when it was reopened by Charlie Lustman, it was indeed an amazing event. - You, everybody knows, who lives in L.A. knows that place. But mostly I would say 99.9 percent of the people who've driven down Fairfax their entire life had seen it, never went inside. And I was one of those guys. - He was a very dynamic guy. He seemed very enthusiastic. He was running around like a chicken with his head cut off trying to make everything just right. I mean the place is beautiful, I couldn't fault him. He seemed to really care. - I was a purist. I wanted it to be a silent cinema with live music. We're gonna run these things every day. - I felt it's time to come face to face with my demons. I'm gonna have to go into this theater sooner or later. So I knocked on the door and lo and behold, Charlie Lustman answers the door. And I had known Charlie back in high school. - When I walked through those doors for the first time since I walked out on Lawrence, I knew that I wasn't gonna be able to leave again. - I called him up. And he said "No, I don't care to subscribe to the Times." You know. That was our starting point. - And before I know it, I'm not only selling tickets but then I'm serving the popcorn and then I'm in the box office. And next thing I know Charlie and I are running this place together. - Charlie kept calling me and said we really, really want you back, we really want you back. And I said no, no, no. And if I said that he brought in a holy man or a shaman, - You know, hard times, you have to take tough measures. You know? So we brought in Maurice and this guy comes in and he looked like an Indian and he was French. And he came in with Kopal which is like tree bark and a big abalone shell and he starts burning this stuff and he had a drum. Then we sit and we have this kind of like seance thing, we're all holding hands and everything. And then we take the crystal. She's like all the energy's been sucked into the crystals. You put them into a bag and he tied it really tight and he hands it to me. You must release these into the nature. Everything worked after he left. Never had a problem with the phones, the faxes, email, you know internet. - Charlie opened the theater and it was quite an event. - Just you know, it's a complete circus. What was interesting to me was the fact that I didn't know what the hell I was doing. - This guy bought the silent movie theater having never seen a silent movie before in his life. And through sheer force of will, he reimagined it, he beautified it without understanding what was so great about silent movies. - He did not know a lot about silent films. - In the beginning, actually very quickly he alienated himself sort of from the serious silent film fan and community. Because he wasn't showing any obscurities. - And in some peculiar way we all felt like we owned it too. We had invested a lot, and here was some guy we didn't know who knew nothing about film. They told me that I was a scam, I'm a sham, a con, a huckster. You know they called me all these things like who is this guy, he's not for real. - They crucified Charlie. Which I thought was unfair. It wasn't any of these grand filmmakers that came forth to save this theater. It was this little singer songwriter. - Bad, are you kidding me? I was sold out for eight weeks straight for Nosferatu. A public domain film that I had. I mean it was just pure profit. That was a great run. Hey man, all publicity is good publicity you know. Even if they caught me in bed with a hooker. That would just be really good for me in more ways than one. - Charlie's defense, he didn't have the amazing collection of films that the theater had had before. This was a guy that had to rent or procure from private collectors whatever he was gonna run. - And he had a completely different crowd in there. It's not like the old gang. You know, it's much younger. He got more people in. - One of the great things about the newly reconstituted Silent Movie Theatre under Charlie Lustman's management was he attracted big crowds. - He thought of it more broadly as more of a stage show with him at the center. ♪ You call me on the telephone ♪ To ask if I am all alone ♪ And when I watch a video today ♪ ♪ You gotta be kidding me - I thought that was marvelous. He learned showmanship. ♪ So what you ♪ Take me to a silent picture show ♪ ♪ Help me - This was a show. And they're looking back at it like it's some kind of artifact. Nobody was getting it. ♪ And take me to the Silent Picture show ♪ - The theater still had the power to make converts. And for that reason, I certainly thought it was important enough to stay for the next five years. - Whether you love Charlie or you hated Charlie, Charlie has to get the credit that he kept the theater open. - Those xenons would be struck and we'd open the curtain and people would applaud just for the main title. - Well Keaton was our number one star. Keaton really kept me in business. - I accept, hey Charlie you cannot just show Keaton and Lloyd and Chaplin and Chaplin and Lloyd and Keaton all the time. - I just realized that comedy's king 'cause I really didn't like the dramas that much. They were a little too melodramatic, they weren't that great. There were just some that were great. You put on a Mernaut picture, it was like wow! - Charlie would often run "Sunrise". He ran it a number of times as a tribute to Larry. - I wanted to kind of show that good prevails over evil. So I ran the movie on the anniversary of the murder. And we packed the house, right. Ready to show the film, we turn the machine on and it stopped. - The film was getting torn up in the gate. So I immediately stopped the projector. And Charlie, Charlie. - Get on up, come on you guys are like, and there it goes. And it goes back on and they were on the picture. At the end of the picture, there was a bunch of people came in the booth, some different people. And said "You know, we don't like you manipulating us. "Wow, how'd you do that?" Projectors went down and it was Larry up on the screen. - People who knew Lawrence say that for that split second, they saw him on the screen. - Folks, we didn't put any picture of Lawrence Austin on the screen. - The films he ran in the beginning, "The Wedding March", "Metropolis", "Big Parade". It was terrific, it really was. - Quickly he learned that he couldn't sustain that and profit, and in fact he realized he was never gonna profit on running silent films alone. So he beefed up his special events business. - What he realized by booking these events is that we could make more money with one good wedding than we could running silent movies for six days. - That was the only for profit silent cinema left in the world. And there was a reason for that. Because you can't live off silents alone. And you can't. - The films were a casualty of that. We showed fewer and fewer silents. Until at the end it was a few times a year. - The last couple years that Charlie had this place we were making more money than ever. But we were burned out. - Then I got sick. - He felt a smooth place above his upper teeth. - Rare sarcoma, cancer in my upper jawbone. - It does seem like it's, the theater has a troubled history. That's kind of part of it. - I decided I gotta check out completely. And at the same time, I finally got some interest from one party who wanted to take over the theater and loved the theater just the way it was and wanted to run the silent movies and so forth and they bought it and here they are today running pictures and I'm back to the music. - Here again, the theater continues to be surprising. - Couldn't believe it. I was absolutely shocked. - Seems that the theater outlasted everyone once again. ♪ You can't measure love by auto rod or meter ♪ ♪ But fill your heart with love each day ♪ ♪ Your life goes sweeter ♪ So put a little love in everything you do ♪ ♪ Love will boomerang right back to you ♪ ♪ Now don't forget it ♪ Love will boomerang right back to you ♪ - Seems like everybody has a story or everybody trying to get into film at some point would come and check it out and maybe see their first silent films here. Kind of became a joke to me for a while because I would go to parties and so many people would insist that they were here the night that Lawrence Austin was murdered. There were more people here that are in the venue. It's like Woodstock. It is physically impossible that as many people claimed to be here managed to all find seats that night. - Hey! Hello? Howdy, holy fucking shit, everybody, right? - We may seem like sacrilegious new punks for trying to take over the place. But we love the stuff, and in reality, we're probably the straightest laced people who've ever been in the venue. The most we ever did was crack open a beer and I can't imagine the things that go on here at night. - The guys now look, seem amazing. They seem to really love the theater and it's still there and it's still showing silent films, they're making room for them. - It really wasn't as much maybe about a nostalgia as it has been, this theater or it's previous film buffs have been, you know. There's always gonna be a little of that. - I don't wanna come here and have a nostalgic experience. I'm not even sure that I could trust that nostalgia. - But the experience was as true as it should be and probably the best as it will get. - The reality of it is, it's a business. And to stay viable as a business, you have to look at various avenues. And let's face it, they haven't been making silent films since 1929. - The responses actually has been a little warmer than I expected. I think initially we had a lot of email and phone calls and a couple people who came in and made comments like what are you doing to my Silent Movie Theatre? A very kind of like personal feeling like how can you bring in sound, how can you start showing Russ Meyer films, this kind of thing. - We didn't wanna mess with too much though because the place was so beautiful as it is. So everything is very delicate. Like getting a couch that would still fit in with the deco aesthetic. - Sounds ironic, but I've gotta say this is a house of disappointment and compromise to me. But I mean that in the very best sense. Because at least it's within a dream endeavored. - Within just one week at this theater, you're gonna see movies that could be up to 100 years apart. And that's the whole history of cinema. And that's what's exciting to me. - This is the smallest projection booth I have actually ever been in. And they put digital projection in. You know, we've got the slide projector. 16 millimeter and 35 so it's really really crowded. - The number one challenge for revival house is getting asses in seats. You can show the most amazing things in the world but if people aren't here, it's like it never happened. - People do have many alternatives. They can Netflix many titles. They can torrent the film and download it off the internet. Or they just can get caught up in watching Youtube. The death of the movie theater has been predicted for a long time now. Television really took a big chunk out of it as everybody remembers. But it didn't disappear. - It should be a spectacle that is overwhelming at some level. Until that TV set is eight times as high as I am, there is simply a physical reaction to having that face be bigger than you that is more totemic, more spiritual, more altar-like. But the number one, size, sound, volume, all these other things, the number one I really believe is the audience itself. I love the moment in the film where everyone kind of gasps together. I sometimes go like, this movie's not even gonna work if I don't have 40 people in. - If the place is packed, it's great, there's nothing like it. Mr. Bob Mitchell! - It's a nice space. And it's a space that you wanna hang out in. A lot of ways, it's what's made the Silent Movie Theatre a great venue. Because there is a sort of history of theatricality to the place that we can continue pretty easily. - As we move on and on and on into the future, that art becomes more and more and more valuable to our world. And that's one of the only places left. - It's about the movies. I won't be here forever. The Harkham's won't be here forever. Obviously Mr. Hampton, Mr. Austin and Charlie, they worked here. And this place goes on. - The theater just has a magic about it. It just hangs in there despite all the many problems it's had over the years. And it's not the most comfortable theater in the world but it's unique. ♪ You ♪ You keep me living in sin ♪ You laugh at me and then ♪ You say that you love me ♪ But I cannot see ♪ You're lying to me ♪ Didn't care for me ♪ You said that you were honest and true ♪ ♪ Love how could anyone ever believe in you ♪ ♪ You deny the chance of loving you ♪ ♪ What could it have been ♪ You keep me always living in sin ♪
