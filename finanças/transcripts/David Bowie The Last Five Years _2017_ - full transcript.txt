In fact, we even had a code word for it, so if anybody intercepted the phone calls, they wouldn't know we were talking about, um, the album. So the album was actually code-named "the table." [laughs] ♪ ♪ There was a lot of discussion about what the album would be called at the time. It was quite gratifying to know that not even David Bowie has everything planned out. ♪ ♪ So it was possibly even called "Love is Lost." ♪ ♪ Possibly going to be called "The Next Day," possibly called "Where Are We Now?" - ♪ Say hello to the lunatic men ♪ - The thing that started the concept for the design was this photograph. It's from the '70s and he said, "I want to do something with this photo for the cover," which I found quite puzzling. He was looking back on his life, even looking at that image, I really struggled with using the image, and then it took Bowie to say "Jonathan, "why don't you just turn the image upside-down?" And within that moment, he subverted his whole history [rock music] So the process was to go through every record cover, every printed image of him, and see how we could subvert it. ♪ ♪ The cover of "Heroes" really had that youthful image of Bowie looking forward to the future, and the square obliterates it. It's existentially talking about someone who's coming closer to the end of their life and looking back on the past. I really wasn't sure about it at the time, to the point, in fact, where the night before it was sent off to the record company, I wrote to him and said, "Are you sure?" And he actually said to me, "No, this is...have faith, Jonathan. "This is a good idea. It's an original idea." - ♪ I'd rather be high ♪ - I think he was subverting people's expectation because of the years away, so he could play with his image. He wasn't a young man desperate to be original. He was someone who lived life and was not up for playing the game of being in the media all the time. [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ Bowie was incredibly happy that we'd managed to keep this thing secret all this time. We had accomplished something unique in a time when everybody knows everything.

Wrong. - His new album, his first in ten years, shot to the number one spot last weekend.

If you feel safe in the area that you're working in, you're not working in the right area. Always go a little further into the water than you feel you're capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth, and you don't feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you're just about in the right place to do something exciting. [jazz piano music] - The way David works. He just keeps evolving, evolving, evolving. David's always looking for that new element and unique musicians to be the carriage for his new ideas. ♪ ♪ Maria Schneider is an amazing jazz composer and how she could've been off my radar, I don't...I don't know, because, uh, she suddenly appeared in my life through David. And when I heard her compositions, it was everything David and I loved about big band music: that it was discordant and strange and ethereal. [melancholy orchestral music] ♪ ♪ - Out of the blue, David called. I said, "Hello?" [laughs] Then...and then proceeded to start to talk to him about the idea, uh, that he had to collaborate on a song. [dark jazz music] ♪ ♪ David brought a little demo of "Sue," so I listened to it and immediately heard this: [plays piano piece with quick bass] I said, "Where do you want this to go?" So it's... it's pretty bright... you know, sounding, and he said, "Oh, I want it to be really dark." So then I started playing around with ways in which I could make that... [plays discordantly] That melody dark, and I just fooled around over here and then I looked at him and I said, "Okay, let's try this." - Maria Schneider said, "You have to listen to this guy, Donny McCaslin." Donny had a band. [plays scales on saxophone] This band were trained jazz musicians, so we had more colors to the palette. [energetic drum beat] - Then I just worked on it on my own a little bit. And then David came over, and then I presented him with all these sketches of ideas and said, "Okay, let me play you lots of different things," and he would either say, "Yeah, yeah, I r... Oh, I really like that." You know, if it had got a real reaction of him... from him, then I said, "Okay, maybe that's the direction," so I just kind of tried to feel him out.

The interviewer asked us both, you know, what was David's relationship to jazz music, something like that, and Tony's response was that he thought that that influence had always been there in David's music, but it was just sort of underneath the surface, and that now, it was just, you know, out there. ♪ ♪ - ♪ Sue, I pushed you down ♪ ♪ Beneath the weeds ♪ ♪ Endless faith ♪ ♪ In hopeless deeds ♪ - Of course, when this thing was released, there were all sorts of comments. Some people were just absolutely hating it and some people were loving it and some people didn't know what to think. ♪ ♪ - ♪ Good-bye ♪ - This is David Bowie. He's not gonna pigeonhole even himself. Imagine how ridiculous he would have looked, you know, if he kept dyeing his hair orange and he was 65 years old with orange hair and platform shoes, you know. He was smart. [dark piano music] ♪ ♪ The radical shift between "Sue" and "The Next Day" is like when he did the, uh, ambient music of "Low" and "Heroes" with Brian Eno. - ♪ Dun-dun-dun-dun.... ♪ [imitating early piano playing] [laughs] Oh... And he'll play that again. ♪ Dun, dun, dun, dun ♪ Oh, wow, I'm feeling low. [bright '80s music] Brian Eno's methodology is a little bit different than any methodology I've ever encountered. That's not rock and roll. Rock and roll is, "Hey, man, I got this great riff. Listen to this." [imitates electric guitar] You know? But when you start experimenting with soundscapes, which is what they were doing, it makes other things come to light. David was listening to a few German bands back then that were at the epicenter of electronic music, and I think that the elec-tronic-al part was too much. That's why he had a R&B, a... a black rhythm section, being, "You want a machine? Let me give you a funk band." [energetic music] But I'll add all the electronic stuff on top of that. Otherwise, he might take the chance of sounding like European electronic music, which he did not want to reproduce. ♪ ♪ - I'd gotten into the idea of real experimentation in music, with the new sounds of Europe and it was this kind of hybrid thing that appealed to me so much.

I was expecting something sort of superhuman, strange, walking in and he presented himself so normal. As a matter of fact, the doorman from downstairs called me and said, "There's a...what? What's your name? Oh, David, here to see you." And I thought, "Oh, dear." [energetic jazz music] ♪ ♪ Can I just stop a second? Did I just say he was normal? There's really nothing normal about David Bowie. You know? But anyway... ♪ ♪ [quiet drum music] ♪ ♪ [tranquil rock music] - When I was around 17, 18, what I wanted to do, more than anything else, was write something for Broadway. I wanted to write a musical. Had no idea of how you did it or how musicals were constructed, but the idea of writing something that was rock-based for Broadway really intrigued me. I thought, "That would be a wonderful thing to do." ♪ ♪ - When we first talked quite quickly he said, "I wanna do a musical," and I said, "Great," and he said, "All I know "is that it's called Laz... "it's gonna be called 'Lazarus,' "and it's based on the character I played "in 'The Man Who Fell to Earth' in the movie, Thomas Jerome Newton." ♪ ♪ - Thomas Newton is an alien. He can't get home. He's relegated to this Earth. He is in the world, but not of it. ♪ ♪ - Outsiders, marginalized people, people that don't belong, that are disp... that feel displaced, not at home, even when they have a house, like Newton. Rich, you know, on Earth, but lost on Earth. It resonated with him. ♪ ♪ - My initial reaction was, "I've got the chance to do a musical "with David, which is wonderful, but it sure ain't gonna buy me a yacht." - [distorted] ♪ Oh, say, can you see ♪ - That was my amused comment to myself, but he said, "I want to see this," you know, "I want this on." - Okay. So, uh, thank you very much, Sophia. - Just before we were due to start a small workshop, I was asked to go to David's office in New York at a specific time, and when I walked in the room, David was on Skype, and then he said, "I need to explain something to you, "because I'm not gonna be "able to be around a lot "during this workshop. "Which doesn't mean that I'm "not gonna be totally involved in it. "It just means that I can't be there sometimes, "because I'm having treatment because I have, uh, a cancer." [classical piano music] I was shocked, but his attitude was that he was gonna be okay. And that was kind of the end of the conversation. - I'm here to get you out of this apartment! Get you home to your planet! I think we should build a rocket! [bold rock music plays] - But of course, once we started, sort of, rehearsal, he was there a lot. He was sort of in and out and in and out, you know, so... ♪ ♪ So he would go, "Oh, let's remove that "scene, and can I write a... can I write a song? I feel as if I should write a song here," and he was really excited about that. ♪ ♪ - He was ill, and, um, he said, uh, writing the musical was on his bucket list. You know, getting finally writing a musical and all that. So that's the only time he got a little bit, you know, sentimental, maybe, like I've got to do these things. - Stupid animal! Stupid creature! - Why don't you tell me what's going on? - Because I can't. - I think that David intended it to be a play that's supported by music, rather than a musical that's supported by dialogue. - ♪ But the film is a saddening bore ♪ - It's about as far from a typical West End or Broadway show as you could get. He wanted this to be an art piece. - ♪ As I ask you to focus ♪ ♪ Sailors fighting in the dance hall ♪ ♪ Oh, man, look at those cavemen go ♪ ♪ It's the freakiest show ♪ - I'd heard that he wanted to do a musical since... someone said the mid-'70s or something or other, and I thought, "Oh, God, "we're beginning something that feels "very, very close to his heart and his head and where he's at." [crescendoing rock music] ♪ ♪ - ♪ Ronda ♪ I really had it in my mind to do a musical of "1984." It was a book that I'd loved all through my youth, but of course, I didn't really take into account the second Mrs. Orwell, who, when she got wind of what we were doing, absolutely put her foot down and said, "Not having rock-and-roll people "work on my late husband's great piece of work." And I thought, "Oh, sorry, I'll do me own version then." - That's a naught. - 2015! - This is the beginning of a film called "Diamond Dogs," and I've put naught in here because I didn't know what year it's set in. - Wanting to do something like write a musical for "1984" and then not being able to do it, via the album "Diamond Dogs," kind of gelled into this thing that we later toured in America. - [singing] - David had the idea of using dance and mime, uh, with two vocalists, myself being one... - ♪ Jean Genie ♪ - And Gui Andrisano, who had been a child star. ♪ ♪ It kind of worked with the input that we had from Toni Basil, in terms of choreography. - But when I met him the first day in his hotel suite, the set was there.
