(Stepbrother) (Stepmother) His secretary. She came into my house after my mom died. My dad tells me to call her 'mom', but I call this woman like this Hey Mrs., got a gum? My dad never lets her out of the house, and always calls home, worrying that this young wife might have an affair. No, I'm not gasping. May be because I ran for the phone. Wait wait.

When this mass ends, please sign up this application form. God's blessings will be with you God's blessings will be with you - Flesh of Jesus Christ. - Amen - Flesh of Jesus Christ. - Amen The reason I come to church every week is to see how much more this man's leg have rot during one week. Is to see how much more this man's leg have rot during one week. Is to see how much more this man's leg have rot during one week. First, there was a boil, and it festered, then later the whole leg got full of pus. Then later the whole leg got full of pus. How much would it itch and hurt? My heart also hurts. I decided that someday I would free him from his physical pain. Frankly speaking, the biggest reason I come to church every week is this. My dad gives me pocket money only when I come to church. A trade of faith and capital so to speak. Ah dad, I am not a beggar! Five hundred thousand Won is enough for a penniless rake! Tae-ho, you missed the last week's mass. Lady, stay out of this Lady? You bastard As if you are gonna take everything to the grave, old screw. You son of a... - Loyalty! //- Loyalty! Halleluiah What is all this in front of the house of God! And I told you to attend the mass this week. Oh brother, I really wanted to attend the mass, but... because of this odor. If I attend the mass, you will find yourself praying you will find yourself praying with only one believer. Then you will be lonely just like I am. How painful... Even there is no chance of that one believer to donate any money, right? Hey, what do you think I am! Well, Good bye Are you out of your mind? Give it back! Mister, once in the box, it is mine! No! No! You might tear it! Give it! Dad! Let go of it! Give it! Give it! Shit, the police! Damn, what do I do now. Well, now may not be the adequate time to introduce my friends, but I will. (Euglena) This guy is a cruel character When he was a boy, a hunting dog bit off his testicles and became the 'unable'. A normal person would have fainted, but this guy revenged by biting off the dog's ear. If he had grown in a good environment, he would have become Nero or Hitler. How pitiful. (Amoeba) This guys is a total monad, but his strength is surprising. How did you meet those friends? Whenever my dad got transferred to other unit, I had to transfer school. It was hard to make friends, I was always lonely. Then when I was 12, I transferred to a small school in the front line. A city called 'Munsan' Hometown of Mu-ryong, Choi, a deceased famous movie star. It was such a beautiful childhood. Stop! You asshole! You're gonna catch me if I stop, right? You asshole! Ok, I won't arrest you, just please let me go. - Really? You are not kidding, right? - Yes! Please, let me go. Hey, can I trust a cop in my country? Yeah, why not. Well... ok. What should we do! Do you know who this man is? He is the greatest cop in our country! I'm a scum comparing to him! You assholes killed the best cop in our country, You assholes killed the best cop in our country, you motherfuckers! Whose fucking car is that? Yours? It's my dad's car. What the fuck does he do? Is he rich? Everyone who drive cars like Mercedes must die! That man hasn't even driven a Tico! But you fucking kids drive a... Huh? Mercedes? Mercedes? It's not a Mercedes, it's a BMW. Say it again? You son of a bitch, say it again, say it again, say it again! Motherfucker you... I will handle you guys later. If you want to live, do what I tell you to do. Ok? Yes sir - Go home - What? Go to your fucking home! Go! Go! Wait! Give me your license and phone number, you assholes. Hello? If you have some conscience, aren't you supposed to send him off to heaven? How dare kill a cop! Hey, no need saying anything. Whoever gets this fucker, don't arrest him, just shoot him. Right, we gotta shoot the motherfuckers at the sight. Let's drink it up. Such a chilly coffin room, right? Yes, it is. So as my heart Yes I know You know? What do you know? This man was really a clean cop, so he couldn't collect any money. Since he did his work faithfully, I am his only friend. I'm sorry. What can I do to make it up? Sorry? Would that make the greatest cop get up from the dead? But, the live ones shall live. Someone is gotta take care of the bereaved. This is not just a plain car accident, and say that I arrest you. There wouldn't be any insurance money, nor agreement. There wouldn't be any insurance money, nor agreement. It is just you becoming a murderer. Well, since he died on duty, there would be a very fucking small bonus. That's the life of policemen. How much would do? How much? Are you trying to deal with me? No, I'm just... How could I deal over my friend's death. Can't you just start with saying Would two hundred million Wons do? What? Are you out of your fucking mind? During your stay in the US after you failed to enter university, I paid 3 hundred million Wons! And you need it again? Why add another hundred million Wons? Oh, that's because I needed one hundred million Wons to avoid the army. Oh, that's because I needed one hundred million Wons to avoid the army. Please give me one more chance! I won't disappoint you this time. This business is... You said the same thing when you went to the US! But you didn't even graduate college! If it goes wrong this time again, I will leave home. Just leave now. Tomorrow morning I am going to do my art, so put my painting tools in my BMW... no SAAB. Ok Oh don't forget the vinyl wrapper. Why the vinyl wrapper? Don't try to know too much about your dad's work, ok? Shit I go to kindergarten everyday to pick up my step brother who is the only one I love in my family. The reason is this sister. You've seen her in church Possessor of bright and beautiful soul Especially when she starts to speak, she becomes even lovelier. Hey yuoo came. Vhee vent frug-seeing, he gut su scered. He-a shuoold be-a fery shucked, su be-a iesy veet heem et home, ok? Thank you. Did you hear her? Vell, I hefe-a tu be-a goiing. Zee priincipel vunts tu see me-a. Ok, See you later Teacher- Are you alright? What's up? Are you selling some of these pictures? Yeah, one shit-faced old man buys many of my pictures. Yeah, one shit-faced old man buys many of my pictures. Damn, how can one make a person like this? I heard drinking shit water is the best on bruises made by assault. Yeah, I think heard that too! Yeah it says on the book! First, strain shit through a sieve, then drink three dippers of that water, and every bruise heals! That's right! Hey, endure! Only two more dippers left Any calls from that asshole? He wants three hundred million. That son of a bitch! He deals over a friend's death? What a motherfucker! It's not all like that. I talked with him, and I found out that cops are very miserable. We killed a cop, would it be ok? I wanna make one thing sure. It can't exactly be said that we killed him. We just let him go. He got into the accident. Yeah! The garbage can killed him. It was there itself! Anyway how could we get three hundred million Wons? Don't you need money for the military? You better tell him well to make him give you the money. My dad is a soldier-origin. I told him to get me out of the duty of army, but he said he will send me to 7 years duty unit. Why don't you just go? Why do you hate army so much? Hey he can't even stay a single day with dirty people. That's why he never slept here. Didn't you know? I can't live without having shower twice a day. I'd rather die than going there. I won't go, I can't go! What a motherfucker! Hey, don't you have anything to drink? No Hey what are you doing! That's soy sauce! That! I know. I know! Are you nuts? Why the fuck are you drinking soy sauce? When you drink soy sauce, your stomach shows black on the x-ray. Exemption from near-sightedness. Last time you ate salt to make blood pressure high. So drinking soy sauce is even better, it also makes blood pressure high. Hey you go out and buy something to eat and more say sauce. Hey, he's not your servant, don't command him. Hey, go You motherfucker, you think I'm nothing? Hey, stop. He is different from us! Take it Hey, how's your dad? Does he still draw pictures? Oh yes! Oh sir, I'm so tired I'm sorry, a little more, a little more! These days it's hard to find water mills like this. For the preservation of cultural assets and development of art... ...these should be protected. Am I not right? Right, honey what is this? Did you spend money on some useless things? Huh? 26, 27... On your knees, now. Let me ask you one thing. Did you donate your organs and eyeballs, too? No I want to ask you why. When... when I die, due to development of medical skills, there would be artificial organs. In the West, artificial hearts and livers are already realized. In the West, artificial hearts and livers are already realized. Do you know what my wish is? Peaceful unification by the South? No, living longer than you But the real problem is My dad will live longer than me. Look, he eats anything that invigorates him, he exercises everyday, doesn't smoke nor drink, and always rides BMW. By the religious life, he is mentally healthy, often fucks young girls and get rejuvenated. If I wait for inheritance, I would die faster. I got a good idea. What? Kill him What? You cold-hearted son of a bitch, are you a human? How can I kill my dad? It is too harsh killing him. Let's just kidnap him. Hey listen. I'm the alibi so I'm out of this. You kidnap him with the stolen car, and you call the police and demand a ransom. Of course, threaten them that you will kill him if they call the police. So we threaten you? Yes. Then I convince my stepmother. Stepmother? I'll tell her What good is money if my dad dies. I will deliver the money. But my stepmother is an idiot so she might call the police. But it doesn't matter. I have plans. In Japan, there is a 'Heaven and Hell', one of the movies of Komozawa Akira, and this is what I saw. You tell me through the phone Take this train of this hour going to somewhere. Then I take the train with the money bag with the detectives. Then I take the train with the money bag with the detectives. They would think that you are trying to get the money inside the train. They would think that you are trying to get the money inside the train. Anyway the thing is, measure the speed Anyway the thing is, measure the speed of the train and tell me to throw the bag at one particular place. Of the train and tell me to throw the bag at one particular place. When I move after the phone call, the detectives will be all flustered. But they are kind of smart, So they would prepare a camcorder to film your faces. In such case, you just put on a big hat. If your face gets exposed, all will come to nothing. Now, when the train approaches, one of you, show that my dad is alive. Then at the accurate time, I throw the bag through the bathroom window. Ok, when the bag drops, one of you pick up the bag and run like hell. One of you pick up the bag and run like hell. You guys would be so happy when you open up the bag. You guys would be so happy when you open up the bag. This is not all for me. First, we can get hell of a money, Dad and my dad would love me for trying to save him despite of any danger. And my dad would love me for trying to save him despite of any danger. This is why I'm kidnapping my dad. To improve the relationship with my dad. Just like that. Isn't it touching? Wow, even though I don't understand what the hell you are saying, you are really brilliant! He is surely different from me. Perfect. How much will you ask for the ransom? Five hundred million Wons. Wait, why another two hundred million Wons? Just because they are my friends, I can't use them for free. I was willing to give them some money. We were faithful. How much for us? One check each One check! A million Won? Two hundred thousand Wons? Ten million Wons. Just listen how he speaks! How old are you? Me-a? Sefen yeers oold Why do you speak like this! Mum, vhat are-a yuoo talking ebuoot? You heard him! This all because of that nun. What would she teach anything if she can't speak standard language! She was born in the country, and she will change. I am sorry. But many kids just love her. I don't give a damn. If that nun stays, I won't let my kid come to this kindergarten. I understand. I will take responsibility of teaching her. Sister Rossa, would you come to my office right now? If there isn't any management, then... you know what I mean. Frankly, which mom would like their kid speak any dialect! Frankly, which mom would like their kid speak any dialect! This not any ill feeling about some area. This not any ill feeling about some area. Let's go Sheet, vhat are-a yuoo gunna du? Yuoo shuoold change-a yuoor vay ooff speeking. I shuoold feesit her. Lfee thuoogh she's a ciity vuman, iff I beg, she-a miight furgeefe me-a. Hey are you doing that to avoid the army? Yes. Of near-sightedness. Stop, you might be blinded. What are you guys gonna do with all that money? I wanna break free from you. Hey what the hell does that mean? I'm sick of being your slave. What? You are not my slave! Since we were kids, you fucking played us with your fucking coins. You are even so much younger than us. Come on, we were kids. You still reign over us until now. If you don't like that, be out of this, Right now. Hey, what's wrong with you! What did he do? Isn't he the only one who helped us? We had no family! Oh yeah, what did you do anything nice to me? You are the one who screwed my life up, you asshole! At that time, if Tae-ho didn't give you five hundred Wons, I would have been killed by you. A person who teases the 'unable' deserves to die. You don't fuck with me. Some day I will crush your head off. Hey how have you been? How's your leg? It is rotting. If it's not cut off, it might rot even more. Oh really Oh, your friends? Oh hey this is... a beggar I know well. Hello Hello Wait a minute, food... Shit Hey lady, this cup is not clean! Do you think I am a beggar? Well enough drinking here, let's go to some other place. I know one place. Um... we have an urgent appointment, we gotta go. Oh shut up. I have money. I have money. A beggar has a car? I would like to be called a 'B.A. C', a poetic expression. B.A. C? What the hell is that? A wanderer who left their home. In other words, the family wait for him to come back By Any Chance. So? What? About the car? Oh the car. I was on my way here on this dark street, and I saw a lonely car. I looked in and there was a key, but not the driver. I looked in and there was a key, but not the driver. At that time, I lost my mind, then later when I got my mind back, I found myself driving this car. I found myself driving this car. So this car can't exactly be mine. Why do you live like this? I once was a student of English literature full of dream, but the military destroyed me. The military? I was beaten up so many times. Why? I was gonna tell you now. You know, I don't like washing myself. That's why they beat me up. Being smelly and carrying lice with me. Once I was hit more than 50 times, and I couldn't stand it. So I took out his gun, shot him, and I ran away. That's why I became a fugitive for 25 years. This is the gun. I hate fuckers who act neat and clean. Motherfuckers. Oh yeah... sure. Washing up frequently is a bad habit. First, you get addicted of washing, and you think it's clean to wash twice a day. And you think it's clean to wash twice a day. But if 'not-washing' becomes a habit like me, it can't be more comfortable. Actually, a person who wash cleanly is all just to look nice to other person. It is very sad to spend one's short life meaninglessly on washing up oneself. But after you ran away, didn't you ever visit your family? Didn't you ever visit your family? Mom! Mom! Mom! Let's drink it up what? What the hell is this? Oh, cut this off. It will hurt. It's ok. I mean it. Cut it off. Are I so poor? By the name of holy God, holy Jesus, and holy spirit, Amen. Please admire us and this food you have given to us. Please admire us and this food you have given to us. Look at the birds in the sky, even though they don't look for food, even though they don't look for food, your God will feed them. My lord, today is the D-day. Please help me to kidnap my dad without any bruises. Please help me to kidnap my dad without any bruises. Please help me to kidnap my dad without any bruises. Please help me to kidnap my dad without any bruises. So let me avoid the army and the police. So let me avoid the army and the police. So let me avoid the army and the police.

Hello? Who is it? Think it's Tae-ho. What should we do? Huh? What should we do? I found out later that there had been a great coincidence. Of course, who they kidnapped was not my dad. That day my stepmother actually called in a man. So the fake phone call about my stepmother became accidentally true. That man always dressed up just like my dad. And came in and out of my house. That day he also had the same hat, same suit, and same car. And that calamity happened. And that calamity happened. Now that I think about it, it was all my fault. I knew what kind of woman my stepmother was, I knew what kind of woman my stepmother was, but I didn't prepare for that situation. But I didn't prepare for that situation. What the hell is this? Did you put this in? Yes For what? Just a memento Whatever. Just bury that thing. What about that nun? Bury her too, she saw our faces! You mean we are killing her? No! We are just burying her. If we do that she will choke to death! It's her problem! We are not choking her! It's too good to just let her die. Can I fuck her? Crazy fuck. Ok, just do it quick. What? I can't do it. Why? Not the right atmosphere. What are we gonna do with this car? Let's hide it in the garage. Hey, that's enough. Hey, aren't we supposed to tell Tae-ho first? He might get pissed off. Tae-ho very angry? Why are you so afraid of him! That exactly is the spirit of a slave! That exactly is the spirit of a slave! No, I mean his father is fucked up because of us. He is not fucked up because us, we are fucked up because of him! We are fucked up because of him! Hey, why are you fucking shouting at me! Fuck! Ok this is the deal. I'll do the thinking, and you bury. Hello? Honey! What didn't you get the phone! There was a disaster in my house! Oh, you are the wife. Don't worry we have your husband safely. Don't worry we have your husband safely. Don't worry. My husband? Is it him? Tell me who the fuck is it! Time to call Tae-ho. What are we gonna tell him?

Yeah, it's me. Everything's ok. We have your father, don't worry. What? My father died 20 years ago! Who the fuck are you! What the fuck is this? Shit! Hey, sister why are you going in to the pit? Hey, sister why are you going in to the pit? Hey, I'm supposed to fuck her. Oh yeah? Then do it quick. Stay still please Just wait, I'm almost done, wait. I'm almost done, wait. What's wrong? I came. Already? You were pressuring me too much! Ok, I'm sorry. Let's just bury that and go back down. Wait, I came before I put my thing in, so I didn't actually fuck her. Stop our crap! You came, you fucked! No, that's our point of view, in her view, she must be angry, because she didn't feel anything! Man, so what the fuck are you trying to say? This is a country of liberty, so let's ask her opinion. This is a country of liberty, so let's ask her opinion. Hey nun, did I fuck you or not? Nu! Yuoo didn't efen poot it in.

In a cabin on the mountain. Wanna see him? No, it's ok. You guys did a good job. What's this woman doing here? Oh, we had a problem, She saw us kidnapping your dad. So we had to bring her. What should we do with her? Tie her up. You asleep? No I guess there is an insomnia. I'd better kill Tae-ho tomorrow. What the fuck do you mean? Are you crazy? Why? We did the crime, and there is no evidence that Tae-ho made us do this. So if we get caught, only we die. But still... I know him by nature. If we get caught, he will be out of this alone. No, I can't do that. Even though I might be bad, I can't kill a friend. Hey let's just tell him. You stupid fuck! We killed his father! You think he'll forgive us? Zhen I cuooldn't efen gu in tu zee house-a, und vas brouught here-a. My vhole-a body huurts. What a bad luck. But there is a way to get out of here alive. But there is a way to get out of here alive. What is that? Changing your way of speaking what? Fur What? Because that brought you to this mess. Because that brought you to this mess. If I chunge, would yuo reelly let me-a go? If I chunge, would yuo reelly let me-a go? Ok... I under... stand. Too short, speak a little longer. I don't... have much... to say. When you get out of here, how are your going to live?

Yesterday, he told me to kill you. I didn't know that he'd really do that. But a guy who betray his friend deserves to die! But a guy who betray his friend deserves to die! I really didn't wanna kill him... but I had to... to save you. Ok, enough I'm more painful that I was betrayed. What should we do now? Easy, bury this asshole also. You killed a friend. But that's why you didn't die. You tried to fuck a nun. Think that you are paying for it. I have the money, come out. Ok, I'll see you there. Two hours later. I'm thinking about quitting this job. I lost all my passion after that friend died. I lost all my passion after that friend died. Then? I'm thinking about doing a shop with my savings. I'm thinking about doing a shop with my savings.

Oh, if you have anything to ask me a favor of, tell me now. Oh, if you have anything to ask me a favor of, tell me now. I heard my dad is sick. My heart broke. If he dies very soon, please tell him to donate his eyeballs to me. I wanna see myself before you guys kill me. Be out for a moment. Ok Why did you want to see me? Detective Baek said... Someone is gotta take care of the bereaved. This is not just a plain car accident, and say that I arrest you. There wouldn't be any insurance money, nor agreement. It is just you becoming a murderer Tae-ho, Mah never mentioned about you to the police or the judge.
