(DOOR BANG) (PIG OINKS) (SOFT MUSIC) (GASPS) (SIGHS) (SNIFFS) (WHISTLES) (WATER PLOPS) (LAUGHS) (DOOR OPENS) (SOFT MUSIC) Wash your hands Porter. Yes, Mom! (SIGHS) (TAP OPENS) (WATER DRIPS) Did you invite my mother in for breakfast? Yeah, whatever Olistene's doing out there in her workshop, she doesn't want to stop for us. Huh? (LAUGHS) Ah huh! What, I rang the dinner bell and Porter heard it all the way from the field. Yeah I didn't wanna bother her. I know she can be a little stubborn, but you can't let her intimidate you. I know! Is that all? Oh, oops! Much better, thank you. Dear, your hat. Oh! (GASPS) (LAUGHS) I'm worried about her. She's always been busy being the only lantern maker in the Valley, but this year has been harder on her with her shaking sickness. What's the shaking sickness? It's a god, see, you're a grandmother well she's old! Now I see why she doesn't eat with us. (SIGHS) You know her hands hurt her more than she lets on. Ah huh. I know how to help her. - (SUSPENSE MUSIC) - You do? Porter can join her for the rest of the day. How, it would be good for her to have some company in her workshop. Mom? Oh, are you sure about that? I mean, if Olistene needed any help or wouldn't she just ask? All right, probably not. She promised to pass along the family trade Porter, just as her grandfather did for her. She promised for next year and there's one whole day left to this year. Only one more day? So why not start today? (LAUGHS) You should know better than to argue with a pregnant woman. (GROANS) I mean, listen to your mother! That's right. (MOANS) Now you be good son. And don't forget to bring your grandmother her breakfast. Honey, are you ready? Yup, I'll take the wagon around front. (PLATES CLATTER) (FOOTSTEPS) (CLOCK TICKING) (BELL RINGS) (DRUMS BEAT) (MUMBLES) (PIG OINKS) How beautiful day for a race? (PIG OINKS) Good morning friends!

Well, come inside then it seems neither of us has a choice. Are you coming in or not young man? (DOOR OPENS) Close the door! (DOOR BANGS) All right, I brought you your breakfast. Leave it there. (BUZZING) This time I'll use one more of these and one less of those. Here we go! Ah huh! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Wow! (SUSPENSE MUSIC) I've never seen a blue fire before. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) What is this? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BLASTS) (COUGHS) Grandmother, are you all right? (COUGHS) Oh no. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Let me help. I don't need help! Is that medicine for your hands? It's something to calm my nerves. Does it work? For a short while at least. Maybe you should eat something. I don't have any time. If I stop now I'll never discovered the secret. The secret? Yes, a secret, and do you want to help? Then I have just the job for you! (LAUGHS) (SOFT MUSIC) (DRUM BEATS) I'm surprised to see you again, Keelan.. Well, good morning to you too, sunshine. What could you possibly have to be so happy about? Huh? You have no job, your clothes are falling apart and your wife left you months ago. For what, a Baker? (LAUGHS) She says that she's stable, stable, unstable, unstable can he be with that giant Baker's hat? One gust of wind and bullshit. Splat fall, right under his own grinding wheel! What are you doing here, Kaitlin? Same thing I've done all year. Oh, so making a losing bet? This time I'm making a winning bet. Do you have any coins? No! Then what are you going to buy a ticket with? This! What is this? My house, my empty lonely house! The universe has taken everything else away from me. Your house? Are you sure? I've never been more sure, of anything in my life. My year long streak of bad luck is finally coming to an end. That's yours to lose. Who's the lucky pig today? Right! Okay Universe, it's just you and me now. Give me a sign, and let me know which little oinker to pick. (PIG OINKS) A sign, any sign! Final backs! Come on! That one! (SOFT MUSIC) (RUBBING) (WATER PLOP) - It's clean! - GRAND MOTHER: Good! Are you making more lanterns to hand out tonight? They're all made one for each and every soul in the Valley. What do you think I do while you're out playing ball? Oh, is that blue oil the secrets you were talking about? GRAND MOTHER: Yes. What is it for? It wouldn't be a secret if I told you, now I wouldn't. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GASPS) Can I help grandmother? (GASPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Oh, I must be tired to making my hand shake. And of course you can help. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) That light is holding! Porter Is that the old Fortress? GRAND MOTHER: Oh, of course not, it's only an old painting. (BLAST) No, Kaitlin! (BLAST) (COUGHS) That wasn't the secret recipe, but it's close. Now what? I try again, while you...

(DOOR CLOSES) The wagon is almost full. Do you think we can find the secret in time? We will if this contraption of ours works. (STRAP) (BANG) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) How do you know one of these is the secret recipe? Oh, it has to be one of these, it has to be. These are the only possible combinations of ingredients left. Are you ready to start? Ready, Grandmother. Grandmother is so formal. Why don't you call me, Nana? Okay, Nana, I'm ready! Now Porter! (SOFT MUSIC) (FLAME BLAZE) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) They're all working.

Everyone else only gambles with what they can afford to lose. Come on in my darlings tonight, we'll sleep in a bed. (LAUGHS) Enjoy the festivities Keelan.. (DOOR BANGS) (DRUM BEAT) (LAUGHS) (DRUM BEAT) (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (MUMBLES) (CLOCK CHIMES) (COINS CHINK) That's a one coin for me and one for your daughter! I've saved two of my very best for you. Whoa, this looks strong! I think they might make it all the way to the moon tonight. (LAUGHS) Hi love. Oh, I'll go. (COINS CHINK) Why do we only give you one coin? That's not much for a whole year of work. I asked my own grandfather that very question. What did he say? He said that traditions like this festival are the glue that holds people together and his time was a small price to keep the whole Daddy happy. Oh! Between you and me, I like the attention. It's nice to have everyone come to you. Even if it's only once a year, especially at my age. (LAUGHS) Here's the last lantern, just for you. One for every person in town. (COUGHS) Now go find your parents. It's almost time to start. I can wait for you Nana. Oh, don't worry about me, I'll be right behind you. Okay, Nana! (FOOT STEPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GASPS) It's almost time, I have to hurry. (SOFT MUSIC) Good evening, Austin, I'm here for a lantern. A lantern? (CLOCK TICKS) Oh, of course, one moment please, young man. (SOFT MUSIC) (GASPS) Just let me find that coin. No, I have one here somewhere. Who I'm I My kidding? I don't have a coin! I don't have anything left, I lost it all betting on pigs! Pig you just said? I should have stopped, but I thought I could win it all back. (SIGHS) You're feeling like the universe is working against you. It sounds like you're the one working against you. My wife said that too, just before she left me, but I couldn't stop myself. The racetrack kept calling me back. Ahaa. "Keelan, Keelan, come back Keelan, this time you'll win for sure." Here you are, and don't worry about the coin. I have a feeling this new year is going to hold a second chance for both of us or at least for me. Second chance? Are you sure you could use one of those? Thanks Austin. Austin? (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (LAUGHING) (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (CART PULLING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SOFT MUSIC) A second chance, a second chance. Huh? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GROANS) (SOFT MUSIC) Which way was it? Everything looks so different. (SOFT MUSIC) Yes! (CART PULLING) (SOFT MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GASPS) The baby! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Where is my mother? I am (MUMBLES) Nana said she'd be right behind me. Porter, go find her, she can't be far. I will Mom, I'll find her. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (METAL CHIMS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Now I find out that the old stories are true. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Yes, yes! The device is in this statue somewhere. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Oh, no, no! Nana, the baby is coming! Nana, where are you? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LANTERN CLINKS) (GASPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) I have no idea what to do. (CLOCK TICKS) Second chance. (GASPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (METAL CHINKS) (SIGHS) It looks like this may fit right here. (METAL CHINKS) (RUMBLING) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (BLAST) It just unlocked, and the wall underneath is the key. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Now this is the key, I'll need to turn it. (METAL CHINKS) Not that way, huh? How about this way? (METAL CHINKS) (RUMBLING) It's working, oh no, you don't! (GASPS) (RUMBLING) Nana, Nana, where are you? (SIGHS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) The Old Fortress just like Nana's painting. (GASPS) (RUMBLING) This is hard work! (COUGHS) Second chance. (SOFT MUSIC) (GASPS) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (GASPS) (FIRE BLAZES) No, no, no, no! (CRIES) (GASPS) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (GASPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) My Secret! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Nana! Porter? (COUGHS) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (GROANS) Nana! (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (CLOCK TICKS) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Second chance! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SOFT MUSIC) (GASPS) (CHUCKLES) (WHISTLES) (MELODIOUS BELLS) (DOOR OPENS) (CHIMES) (LAUGHS) It worked, it actually worked too! Your story was true. Happy new year Olistene! And a happy new year to you too, son! Mwaah! (MUMBLES) I feel if the weight of an entire year has been lifted from my hands. You would look so handsome with a great big beard. You know what? I was thinking about growing one. (MUMBLES) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SOFT MUSIC) I'm off to work, honey! (DOOR BANGS) (SIGHS) Let's get that blood flowing! (SIGHS) It's gonna be a good year! No, a great year! I can taste it in the air. (SOFT MUSIC) (DOG BARKS) What's the now, pig races? Hmm? (WHISTLES) (PIG OINKS) (SOFT MUSIC) (GROANS) Are you all right, what happened? Olistene kissed me, and she called me son. She did what? Are you two talking about me? Oh, good morning. Wash your hands Porter. (GROAN) (WATER DRIPS) (CHUCKLES) No, I don't need to be picked up, I'm almost eight. (DING) (LAUGHS) My little man. Mother? Yes dear? I've been... Dear? Hmm! Your hat. Ooh! (GROANS) (LAUGHS) What we've been talking and we think it's time for Porter to learn the family trade for you to teach him how to make the paper lanterns. Do you? What, I'm just a kid! You said it yourself son, you are almost eight. That's not what I meant. Yes. Before you answer, I prepared a list. I will. First item, you yourself were younger than Porter when great grandfather began teaching you, wait, what did you say? I said, I agree. I'll apprentice the boy in the family trade. You will? On one condition. What? Please give him one more year. I was too young when grandfather started teaching me and besides I feel more than healthy enough to handle this year by myself. Yes, I'm only seven now give me another year Mom. All right, next year then. (SIGHS) Honestly, I didn't expect you to say yes so quickly. I spent all night writing this list. I know better than to argue with a politician. Oh, speaking of which I don't wanna miss the first council meeting of the year. Would you like a ride to town council woman? My wagon is at your service. Oh, well sir. How can I refuse? (KISSES) (GROANS) Close! (LAUGHS) (SOFT MUSIC) (COCK CROWS) (SOFT MUSIC) I finally found the secret of the Valley grandfather. The old stories of the Fortress were true. Now my lantern is made of bronze instead of paper. And I never have to let it go again. (LAUGHS) (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (PIG OINKS) So, I bet on which little pig I think we'll win in a race? For the fourth time, yes. Or how do you make them run? I use the carrot on the stick method. Ingenious, here are some coins! Wait, what happens if I pick the wrong pig? If you lose today, there will always be another race tomorrow. Now, which pig do you like to win? I'd like that one to win please. (PIG OINKS) (SOFT MUSIC) That was a waste of time and coins. I won't be going back to those pig races anytime soon. The universe has spoken and I'm listening tomorrow it's right back to work, that's a sure fact! (DOOR BANGS) Come on (MUMBLES) (PIG OINKS) (SOFT MUSIC) (CHUCKLES) (DOOR CLOSES) (SOFT MUSIC) (BRUSH SCRAPPING) (SIGHS) (WATER SPLASH) (GROANS) (COUGHS) (GASPS) (PIG OINKS) (DRUM MUSIC) (LAUGHS) (SOFT MUSIC) (GASPS) (SOFT MUSIC) (GASPS) (SOFT MUSIC) (GASPS) Oh, No!

(SOFT MUSIC) (GASPS) (SOFT MUSIC) (WATER PLOP) (FIRE BLAZES) (MUMBLES) (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) mu This looks strong! Think they might make it all the way to the moon tonight? (LAUGHS) I'll go. Your Father makes the same bad joke every year. (COINS CHINK) Why do we only give you one coin? That's not much for a whole year of work. It's because I love my work so much. Oh! I know, here's your lantern Porter go find your parents it's almost time to start. Yes, grandmother. - (GASPS) - Oh my! (CLOCK TICKS) I have to hurry. Good evening, Olistene, I'm here for a lantern. Oh, how did I forget you again? Again me, again? You look for your calling while I find your lantern. Who I'm I kidding, I don't have a coin. I don't have anything left. You ever feel like the universe is working against you? The universe made you bet on pig races? You heard about that, huh? Oh, cheap forget the coin, take this and enjoy the festival. Olistene, I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but do you think this lantern will fly? Olistene? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (CLOCK TICKS) (CLOCK TICKS) (INDISTINCT CHATTERS) (GASPS) Good evening, Olistene, I'm here for a lantern. I have your lantern right here. Just let me find my coin. Forget the coin. Oh, thank you. How can you make the same mistakes every year? Every year? I don't understand. You always have the same excuse how the universe is working against you. Well, I... The universe didn't make you bet your house on a Pig Race. News here travels fast around here. Life doesn't happen to you, Keelan, you have a choice in what you do. But what if I keep making bad choices? Then take responsibility and stop doing it! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Are you all right, Olistene? Your hands are shaking. Maybe you should sit down. No, I don't have time for this nonsense. You'll never do anything different. Is that your lantern? Let me help you down the water. I'm not going to the water and I don't need your help. You're not going to the water? Yeah! Where are you going? (SOFT MUSIC) (CART PULLING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SOFT MUSIC) (METAL CLINGS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GASPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Wow! You think this far could get easier after so many times. (GASPS) What is happening right now? (GASPS) What are you doing here? I didn't know there was anything in this whole pile of rocks. You can't be in here, you have to go! (METAL CLINGS) No! (GASPS) This is an old calendar, isn't it? But why are you turning it backwards? Unless you're resetting the year somehow. That's what you meant about me making the same mistakes over and over. How did you figure that out so fast? I'm right, really? I've been reading the story of the Old Fortress as kid but I wouldn't have dreamed it was true. I don't have time for this, you'll have to come back with me. Okay, now we're talking. Do you need some help? Stop asking me that! I don't need any help! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Grandmother! No! Who's the kid? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Come in Porter, and stay close to me. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (COCK CROWS) (BELL DINGS) (INDISTINCT CHATTERS) (CLOCK TICKS) (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (GASPS) (LAUGHS) (HUMMING) (DOOR OPENS) Oh, no now what am I going to do? Where is Porter? (SOFT MUSIC) (WHISTLES) Stop playing with your tooth Porter, you're making it loose. You're not pregnant any more mum? Pregnant? Is my baby sister upstairs? Baby sister? What has gotten into you today? (LAUGHS) It sounds like somebody wants a baby sister. (LAUGHS) How bout it, honey? (LAUGHS) Oh, it looks like breakfast will have to do for now. (PLATES CLATTER) Dear? Huh! Your hat. Oh!(GROANS) (LAUGHS) What happened to your beard Dad? You know what, I was thinking about growing one. We've been talking and we think it's time. Well, I wrote this list of reasons for Porter to... Allow me, my dear, I believe it's high time for Porter to learn the family trade of lantern making. What, really? He'll be turning eight soon. But I already turned eight. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) Ouch! And that's far older than I was when I started with my grandfather. This is so surprising. That would be wonderful. And what time is better than the present? Mom? Listen to your grandmother and do what she says. We'll be taking the Wagon. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) Did my mother just volunteer to teach our son? I guess she stayed up all night writing that list for nothing huh? (CHUCKLES) Let me enjoy this for one moment, please. What happened last night? How did I get my tooth back? Well, the last night you remember wasn't actually last night. What does that mean? I'll explain it on the way, I have to find someone and I'm not letting you out of my sight, not for a moment. Now, where do I begin? Do you know the story of the Old Valley Fortress? I heard that it was destroyed by an army. And now we have a Lantern Festival about it. (CHUCKLES) There's a little more to it than that. (SOFT MUSIC) Long ago, the founders of this Valley lived under the protection of a mighty stone Fortress. A Fortress with a secret. A secret? Mmh, somehow they knew exactly when any disaster was going to strike the Valley. Any disaster, floods, famines, or fires. How did they know what would happen? That was the power of the secret. If a disaster struck, they would restart the year. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Just like we did last night, with the blue light. That's right. And because they remembered exactly what was going to happen, they could prepare before it struck again. I remember losing my tooth, but it's still here. That's because you haven't lost it yet, just as your father hasn't grown as big beard and you haven't had your eighth birthday. And how Mom isn't pregnant with my baby sister. Yes, that too. (SOFT MUSIC) (DOG BARKS) (DOOR OPENS) I have a house, coins in my pocket. My wife is back, no she never left. Could it be that the universe finally took pity and it's given me, (PIG OINKS) (SOFT MUSIC) A second chance? (CART PULLING) (SOFT MUSIC) Why did that Army destroy the Fortress? They were jealous neighbors from the other valleys who wanted the secret for themselves. Why didn't the people share with them? Because it was too powerful for just anyone to use. They had to protect it. But isn't that selfish? Selfish? Who knows what the others would have used the secret for? If the people knew they were going to be attacked by an army, why didn't they restart the year and prepare for that? The army came on New Year's Eve. So they didn't have a chance to use it. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) By the next morning, the Fortress was burned and the secret lost. It was lost, until I found it! Now it's mine to protect. (SOFT MUSIC) You don't remember me at all? Should I? I gave you the deed to my house, last night. If I had a house, would I sleep here? (SOFT MUSIC) (PIG OINKS) It's as if last year's happening again and only I know it! Oh, the universe is giving me a second chance! Are you betting or not Mr. Universe? Ooh, yes I am. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) And I know just the little oinker, is gonna win this race. (PIG OINKS) Grandmother, I don't remember any disasters. What's that, disasters? If you restarted the year again, like in few days, what disaster are you saving us from? Oh, well, I... And if we're the only ones who know shouldn't we tell someone? We can't do that, We have to protect it to keep the secret, secret. Who knows what day you would do with it? (SOFT MUSIC) (MUMBLES) Not even Mom? No, not even Mom. No one can know. You have to promise me that you won't tell anyone about this secret, okay? Your mother told you to do what I said, didn't she? Yes. Promise me you won't tell anyone, Porter. Okay, grandmother, I promise. That's a good boy. What about the man, the one that was in there with us? He's the reason we need to find a Pig Race. A Pig Race? (BIRDS CHIRP) (FOOTSTEPS) Wah! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (PIG OINKS) Pig Racing, why didn't I know about this? It's not something you want to have anything to do with. (GASPS) (PIG OINKS) (LAUGHS) Keelan? Huh, Olistene? You found me fast, this is amazing! Thank you, oh, thank you! Don't thank me. Why would you come back here to make the same mistakes again? Mistakes? Your wife always leaves you because of this place. Always, how many times have you used that lantern? And I've to know what I'm talking about. I know something too. I may have bet on all the losers last year, but I also remember each and every winner! (RAMBLING) (PIG OINKS) (COIN CHINKS) And my wife won't leave me when I'm rich! (COIN CHINKS) I didn't use the lantern to make you rich. I noticed your hands aren't shaking anymore. That's why you do it, isn't it? Restarting the year makes your hands healthy again. Look, you can stop worrying Olistene. I'm not gonna tell anyone about this gift. It's between you and me, you go your way and I'll go mine. You won't even see me again if you don't want to. Agreed? (SIGHS) Fine, agreed. (PIG OINKS) Hey, you there, keep your boy away from the pigs. We were just leaving. Come on Porter, we're done here. Yes! Can I come back? No, and don't tell your mother, I brought you here. (CHINGS) (DOOR OPENS) (GASPS) (SOFT MUSIC) (GASPS) - (DRAMATIC MUSIC) - Huh! Here, sweep the floor! (GROANS) (FIRE BLAZES) (GASPS) (SOFT MUSIC) Did your grandfather teach you about the secret of the Fortress? Not all of it, but what little was known was passed down through the generations of lantern makers. I worked for a long time to discover this special blue oil. When I finally found it, it was almost too late for me. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LAUGHS) Besides my grandfather had no interest in learning the secret. He took the New Year's Festival very seriously. (SNIP) Did you all know that our family has been making these lanterns, since the very beginning? Back to when the Fortress was destroyed and the farmers began the festival. (SNIP) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Why are the lanterns made of paper? We make the lanterns out of paper, so they are light enough to float. And we let them burn to remind us that like the old Fortress, nothing lasts forever. (CHUCKLES) When I was your age, I never wanted to let my lantern go. What's the point of holding onto something that's meant to float away. How did you get to be so wise? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (COIN CHINKS) (QUAKE) (COIN CHINKS) (SOFT MUSIC) Ouch! Let me see that finger. But you made it look so simple. Simple does not mean easy. (COIN CHINKS) (QUAKE) (LAUGHS) (COIN CHINKS) (SOFT MUSIC) (FIRE BLAZES) Oh, no! (GASPS) (COUGHS) (SOFT MUSIC) (LAUGHS) (COIN CHINKS) (QUAKE) (LAUGHS) (PAPER FLIPS) (SOFT MUSIC) Whoa! (SOFT MUSIC) (LAUGHS) (DOOR OPENS) (SIGHS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GASPS) What? (GASPS) (PAPER FLIPS) You have such beautiful eyelashes. Huh, what? All the girls at school must be jealous. They come from your father's side of the family all you'll get from me is my mustache. (DINGS) (CHUCKLES) (LAUGHS) Oh don't you worry? I'm much too old to care about things like that. (AIR WHOOSHING) (DRUM BEATS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (PIG OINKS) (LAUGHS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GASPS) Mother you're crying? I'm just happy, my dear. (PIG OINKS) So you're probably wondering what has me so down, aren't you? Well, she left me. My wife left me for the Baker again! (PIG OINKS) She called me selfish, said that I spend too much time at the Pig Track. But it was not that I was losing, I was winning this time. What more does she want? (PIG OINKS) I tell you all I need now is a second chance! A second, second chance! (PIG OINKS) If only there was some ancient Fortress Secret that would let me live this year all over again. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LAUGHS) Huh? Why does everyone always leave me? (PIG OINKS) (SOFT MUSIC) (FOOTSTEPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hello Olistene? Huh, Oh, it's you, you appear to be doing well for yourself. Oh, this old thing? How about you Olistene, what's that doctor's medicine for is you're shaking sickness back? It's nothing, just something to calm the nerves. I see, look, I'll get to the point. It's almost the new year and I'm ready and willing to do whatever you need to restart it again. I haven't decided if I'm going to. (LAUGHS) You're trying to get rid of me, aren't you? Haven't I left you alone until now? You don't have to worry about me hanging onto you all next year, new year, next new loop year, whatever you call it, we do the lantern key thing and then go our own ways again, snap, snap. I really don't need the help, thank you. You don't need, well I need you to do it again. What can I do to change your mind? It's by choice to make, just be happy with what you have. Let's go home. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Done, and one day early too. How do you know this is enough? It's enough if all of the shelves are full. Where do I put yours then? Mine? Well, you didn't count yourself, so I made a lantern for you. Oh my, this is very well-made. You must have spent a lot of time on this. We'll have to add another spot next year too. For who? For my baby sister. Oh yes, of course, for your baby sister. Since we finished in here, how about I show you my favorite spot in the Valley? (SOFT MUSIC) Wow, You can see the whole Valley from up here! That's our house over there. And that's where I played ball. Come here for a moment, Porter. I'd like to talk to you about something important. What is it? Do you know why I restarted the year? Does it have to do with your hands? You noticed that did you? Well, my own grandfather had the same shaking sickness. It's the reason he began teaching me when I was younger than you. There is no cure for it. And the year after he got it was well, it was not kind to him. I'm afraid that my hands will become like the branches of this tree moving without any say of my own subject, only to the blowing of the wind. That I won't be able to work at the lantern any more. that I'll become useless. I'll help you with the lanterns from now on. You won't ever be useless. You are going to be out good big brother. Big brother? Does that mean you're not going to restart the year again? I've had such a wonderful time with you this year. I don't want to throw it away. And besides I'd like to finally meet my granddaughter. Do you promise grandmother? (LAUGHS) I promise, and please call me Nana from now on. And I promise to always take care of you, Nana. What effort did I do to deserve a boy like you? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (WATER RIPPLES) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Dear, your hat. (GASPS) (LAUGHS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LAUGHS) (GASPS) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (FOOTSTEPS) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) The Cabinet. I parent's lantern is gone. Not gone, it's right here. Keelan, what are you doing? I'm here to ask you to restart the year again, Olistene. Then the answer is no. I made a promise to never use that lantern again, and I intend to keep it. No. It's my choice to make, you've made your own. Now we both have to live with the results. We all learn the Old Fortress stories children have selfishly kept the secret to themselves that it led to an army marching to their walls. And as I recall, it didn't end well for them. What are you saying? What if the whole town knew that the old stories were true, that you've been keeping them all in this loop year without any choice of their own over and over and over again. You wouldn't want your daughter to know how many times she's been pregnant with you. What would she think of dear old Mom now? You Couldn't be that cruel. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) If your hands are paining you now imagine how much worse it will be without the help of friends or family. Once they learn the truth, they'll all leave you like my wife left me. When will it end for you, how many times will be enough? If your wife wants to go let her! Like you let it all go for so long? You're the one who told me not to just let life happen to me, but to take control. That's what I'm doing right now. This is good for both of us. I get my wife back and you get your health. Oh, I don't want to threaten you Olistene. I want to offer you a helping hand. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Now, how do we make the blue fire? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (MUMBLES) (SOFT MUSIC) (CLOCK TICKS) (GASPS) Here you go, Olistene. (COIN CHINKS) That's one coin for me and one for your daughter. I've saved my very best for you two. Oh, these look strong. They might make it all the way to the moon tonight. (LAUGHS) Does dad always make that joke? Yes, always. Now here you are young man go join your mother and father, I'll be right behind you. You promised, remember? I remember see here's the lantern you made for me. Okay Nana, I'll go ahead. Good work on the little boy. I think he actually believed you. Come on now. You won't even remember that you broke your promise when we're done. What are you doing? I'm driving the wagon. Do you know how? How hard could it be? Yeah, let's go! We're not moving, why aren't we moving? Oh, it feels like we're moving. Move, move! Oh, no! Olistene, you're not gonna need that tonight. (LAUGHS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Nana's gone! Nana? Grandmother! What do you mean gone? With the wagon! My wagon? Where would she go? There's something I wasn't supposed to tell you, but it's important. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GASPS) The baby! It would be faster to walk. We're not walking! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) A pink gambling man has taken my mother to the old Fortress to restart the year? It's true, you have to believe me. Restarting the year? And if we don't stop then my baby sister won't be born. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) No one, no one is gonna stop my baby girl from big born! Where is this pig gambler now? At the Old Fortress, but it's going to take us too long to get there. Let me worry about that son. You steer us in the right direction. Steer? (GROANS) No, not that way. (GROANS) Back, back! How do you make this thing go back? (GROANS) (GASPS) (SOFT MUSIC) Hey, hey, hey! (GASPS) We made it! I got us here in time. You're shaking worse than my hands. Come on you. (CLOCK TICKS) I remember glowing blue flowers in here, are you sure we're doing it right? You need more light. Ouch! (LAUGHS) There they are. Yes, yes all very impressive I know. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) You have a lantern over here, that's sort of a key. (METAL CLINKS) (THUD) It's working! (THUD) I understand, you have to turn it back the full year. (GASPS) Before my wife left me, for Bookmaker. This time I'll figure out how to keep her. I made a promise, a promise to Porter. We're almost there. (GASPS) Only one more turn. (COUGHS) (METAL CLINKS) What are you doing? It's too late to change your mind now Olistene. No, I'm done living in the past. Well, I'm not. (GASPS) (METAL CLINKS) (GROANS) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) There! No! Now it's too late. (GROANS) That's him Dad, the pink gambler. You don't get to take my little girl! What, little girl? (GROANS) (SCREAMS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Nana, you promised! No, no, I can't let it happen, not again! I told you it's too late. (LAUGHS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GASPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (CLOCK TICKS) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (THUD) No! (METAL CLINKS) (BLAST) (SOFT MUSIC) You have to let our lantern work. You have to remind us, that nothing lasts forever! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BULB BREAKS) (BLAST) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (CLOCK TICKS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (CRIES) Nana! (BELL RINGS) (COCK CROWS) (CLOCK TICKS) (SOFT MUSIC) (PIG OINKS) This is good. Glad you like it. Got any salt? Here. Thanks. You're welcome. I'm still surprised you brought me into your home after what I almost did. And hold almost against you. Besides it wasn't you who restarted the year over and over and over again on your family and everyone you knew without them ever knowing? No, I guess not, but Olistene had her reasons. (SIGHS) I suppose so. She told me once, maybe twice that I had to take responsibility for my choices. I didn't understand what she meant at the time, but looking back now I do. Hmm. At least I had my house to go back to my empty house. (MUMBLES) What was it that? I guess we could ask her. - (COUGHS) - I said, pish, posh. You'll stay here. Really? We've all made our own mistakes Keelan, but those are in the past, for good this time. And I can always use another hand on the field. Only you have to promise to keep him away from the pigs. (LAUGHS) Look Nana, I lost my tooth again. (CHUCKLES) What'd you look at that? Did you come down here for anything else Porter? Oh yeah, Mom is ready to see now. Is she still angry with me? I wouldn't bring up the whole restarting the year thing if I were you. I will stay here. Don't worry, we'll come back to you. Thanks, Olistene, for everything. (SOFT MUSIC) (DOOR OPENS) Nana's here! Please come in. Come closer and say hello to your granddaughter. (BABY CRIES) She's beautiful. (LAUGHS) And look, she has your eyelashes Porter. (CHUCKLES) MOM: Her name is Olistene. She's named after you Nana. (BABY CRIES) Hello little Olistene and welcome to the family. I kept you waiting a long, long time, haven't I? (BABY CRIES) (UPBEAT MUSIC)
