May 1945 Millions of years have elapsed since the world began... It emerged from far, far away, from cosmic nebulae... Water and fauna imbued this world with life. Cell joined with cell, out of this emerged flora and fauna. Primeval man evolved from a monkey. He was born and became the lord of nature... And what next? And what next? And what happened next? Man set off to make history. He marched on with pride. He encountered war, which made him sore, and he said: “Enough is enough!“ He said: “Enough!“ He said: “Enough!“ And what happened next? The Red Army and its tanks came from the east. Thank you for freedom and peace. In the name of Beneš, in the name of Stalin... Forward we march! We march! Hail, oh Christians. Hail, oh Christmas, the Holy Mother. Let us zealously sing and worship the Princess of Heaven. Let us start from the beginning. These are the sons of the butcher, Machač, who died in a motorbike accident after he had been drinking as a result of securing a good deal on an ox. Since then, his wife's been called the Merry Widow. None of us here actually live under our real name. There are lots of Machačs, Jiříčeks and Palatas. So everyone has a nickname so people can tell each other apart. This one's called Lithpy because he can't pronounce "s" properly. Bring it back, you scoundrel! Just you wait! It's got to be someone bigger, a stag or a man. František is a farmer. The war raged through his field. He has to plough it all over again. He loves ploughing and hence he does it well. Make a circle, my bonnie lass, my little dove, sweet little chick, you'll be mine, mine alone... Franta Lampa's a tailor. He's called "Lamp" because of his passion for lamps, lanterns and torches. You aim at his head, I'll aim at his arse, it's smaller. Oh, God, what is this, what is this? What's the meaning of this? - Give it to me! - Hold them! I'll tear you to pieces! You brats! I scared you there, didn't I? What're you looking at? It's me, Lithpy! Don't I look smart? Come on. - Are you hungry? - What have you got? A cake. Bloody hell! They scared me to death! Rascals! Take this as a souvenir. I'll handle this on my own. There were seven friends: Jořka, Lampa, František, Joza Trňa, a bricklayer, Janek Fafka, a smallholder, Očenáš and Bertin, about whom, since he came here from Prague, they say that behind every Czech stands a devil with a sack. - Oh! Don't run away! - Jump off! Come here! You bastards, I'll show you! Get ready! I'll show you when I catch you, you scoundrels! I can't believe this. - What's going on here? - It's a secret! Those brats of yours will end up at the gallows! - Take it easy! - Little bastards! Heads down! It will make an abyss! - My mouth is full of sand. - I can't hear you. How could you hear anything if your cap's covering up your ears? That was some bang! Franta, are you hurt? I'm not hurt, lads, I just shat myself. Zášinek, the second richest farmer after Kurfiřt. A widower, his Jewish wife was taken away by the Germans. He prefers music to his fields. It may be in his blood from a Gipsy baron who once travelled through here playing the violin beautifully. He fell in love here and maybe left something behind him. I'll put a few dandelions round your neck, you old ox, and you'll look like a Hawaiian cow. Just like a real one. Circles under the eyes, can you see, you beast? Close the crapper door, it's draughty in here. Give me your hand! Give me your hand I say! It just fell down, this thing. There are some things you only need two people for. Early Spring 1948 The action committee will decide who shall be excluded from public life. Politics will cease to be mud-slinging and become a matter of honour. This is what we say, gather your wits about you. There is evidence that the reactionary forces are again beginning to rear their ugly heads. It is permitted to sell to or obtain from a person a maximum of 1 kg honey. If a higher quantity of honey's transported, the upper limit being 5 kg of honey, it must be accompanied by a written permit. When we overcome the consequences of last year's bad harvest, we'll supply the market and life will be good again, for the Czech Crown is one of the most stable currencies in Europe. Restless Bertin became Secretary of the Action Committee. - Hello, Mr. Vigoň. - What is it? I've got something for you. Sign it here. Listen to my chiding, you're about to get a whooping. - What? - Thrashing. - Why? - Because you're in with them now. - Just sign this, Mr. Vigoň. Organist Očenáš became Chairman of the Communist Party. Smallholder Zejvala - the chairman of the cooperative farm. And foreman Máčala - the local council secretary. They took power with all the ensuing consequences. The world was thus divided into two. I wonder who they're after this time. But when the tide turns, they're bound to get the axe! Axe? You wouldn't even be able to lift it! Good morning. Kurfiřt, the richest farmer, has to leave his farm. They took everything from him. It came like a flood. His farm will be made into a cooperative. If my farm was just a bit bigger than yours, I'd be me the villain, not you. - Hop, hop... - Damn it! Zejvala, don't make a mess of it like you do at home. Full of cowpats! We'll manage without your advice. When this place is infested with rats, don't call me. We'll show you what we're made of! Giddy up, girls! This is going to be a farm ride! You could build a whole cottage with wood like that! No, no, that's nothing. Let's go and see if there are any bottles left in the cellar. - There's nothing there, I checked. - We'll find something. I don't sell meat, I sell paper. The butcher is called Rabona, it's also a nickname, because of his strange personal and physical characteristics. With one blow of his fist, he can kill a calf; or a man at the village ball. This will be the salon. And Mum... Here you can work with the seamstresses. This is the toilet. At home we have to cross the yard or go straight to the manure pile. I must try this. Just try it, go ahead! Well, we know that Wallachians swung about in the trees. The roof will hold for another hundred years. It's the roof that counts. It's clean everywhere, no mice. I hope you'll be happy with it. Abracadabra... Let there be light. Spring, summer, autumn, winter. And this will be like hell now for your Dad. - And get some lanterns. - No way, this isn't a cabaret. It won't do you much good making friends with the organist. - Why? - You might be sorry when things change. He's going to hang, anyway. The future of our trades is at stake, you'll also be a co-op, and Juchta... - A cake co-op! - Also a co-op owned by the state. Don't think that by scuttling over to their side they'll leave your house alone. They'll take it anyway. - Why would they take it if it's ours! - I wouldn't worry about that. - We just came to warn you. - And the same goes for you, Lithpy. I'm not worried, I come from the right family. And I've got it up here. Soviets plus electrification equals Communism. Who the hell is it this time? Welcome, welcome! Go and get some glasses. - Have you come for a game of cards? - Possibly. Cut the deck. Your father was a worker, wasn't he, Lampa? No, a shoemaker. Why? I suppose you're going to ask if he was a Jew. But after Baťa started up, he went out of business, didn't he? He just did whatever there was. So he was actually a worker, wasn't he? Well, he worked for a farmer as a lumberjack, he was out of work, too. - Were you poor? - Yeah, we were. So you've got the right background. You should also know where your place is. - Do you know what we're about to do? - What do I know? Do you know what you are now? You're an exploiter. You've got two apprentices. You're also exploiting you wife. - We could make things bloody difficult for you. - Why? We could give you a really hard time, you can't even imagine. Why pick on me, aren't there others? Of course there are. Listen, if you sign, we'll put you in charge of the cooperative. If not, I don't really know where we could put you. As a businessman yourself, you should set an example. I'm the only photographer around here. Anyway, I don't intend to do it. So you're going into politics? What's wrong with that? If I sign, will you let me keep the house I bought with hard-earned money? Not exactly hard-earned... it was also black-market stuff. And the fabrics the Jews gave you before Germans took them... The salon's finished. You'll look after the house, we'll split up the flats and give them to needy families. And we'll be really tough. If anyone opposes us, he'll get it in the neck! June 1949 Božka, the landlady, is a real country wench from the region of Haná. Hardly anyone can keep up with her and not only on the dance floor! Don't, I have to be fit to scythe the meadows today. When his wife perished in Auschwitz, Anděla became Zášinek's housekeeper. She loves him. She thinks about him when he's up to some mischief in pubs. She keeps waiting in her room, hoping that perhaps one day... The best reapers: Kobza, former submarine sailor of His Majesty the Emperor. Náca the Liar. Arnošt, who reads a book first and then binds it. Kejvala the Jester. Lanky. And this is Něguš, the oldest. No rum, no work done. Okay, this is fine. Stop fidgeting. Remember all the mischief we got into in May that year? And do you remember how we detonated that mine? And how you in fact... Well, well, I wasn't the first and I won't be the last. That's for sure! - What did you say? - Nothing. A uniformed policeman seeks out Očenáš. He tells him to go to the old quarry to find a secret transmitter. There's one thing he doesn't tell him: when he comes to that place, he'll be felled like a stag. Juchta and Rabona gave this their blessing. Come here. Come along. You're pushing yourself too hard for nothing. People hate you and you still work hard for them. They avoid you, you keep pushing them... and you don't even know why. You're forcing them into something they don't want. One day they'll see we meant well and that we wanted the best for them. And if not for them, then for their children at least. - Their children will want something else. - Come on. Oh, they're hot. But good! Good morning, everyone. It's raining. Have some, they're good. Máčala set the people against him again. I tried to pacify the women. But it was no good. You should go there. They might listen to you. Damn. I've got something important to do now. Or perhaps you could go there instead? Who changed their fate? Who shuffled their cards and cast their dice? Who? What's the difference between a stag and a man? It's so easy to take aim and kill after all. The sun was shining above our garden, the boys were joyous, my Marian, my soul, the boys were joyous, my Marian, my soul. When Rabona talked, they came for Juchta as well. The search for the murderer, and the man with a moustache, was fruitless. - "When the wind changes, you'll hang!" - Let's leave before they kill you! What's this supposed to be? Let the priest go, he's innocent! You can't tell us who's guilty and who isn't! We'll wait and see! He's innocent and if you don't let him go, we'll come back again. The locals and people from other village, too. - God be with you. - Welcome. We'll never have another organist like you. What can I do if you don't want me here? I defended you before the church council. They're all convinced it was you who had the priest put away. It wasn't me even if I didn't like his sermons. Why should people go to prison for preaching? Thank you. I believe you. We both got caught up in the millstones. They keep turning and crushing. You can't do anything about it. It's a good thing we're going away - they'd kill him otherwise. And thank you for Maria. She's grateful for all you've done for her. Don't mention it. Village bumpkins! Just village bumpkins. They're so ugly, horrible heads. You messed this one up. She looks like she's got gangrene. Listen, now that Očenáš has run off, you could take over. Who'd vote for me? Peton or Máčala will nominate you. You can bet on Peton. They might even promote you to the district, then to the region, and you'll be an MP eventually. You can even become a minister. You've got your head screwed on. And they'll have to give us that nice flat of Juchta's. With three bedrooms! And what if they do me in like Bertin? What? They'd be too scared to do that. July 1951 - Have you got the summons? - Yeah. I've come to remind you you're starting your sentence on Tuesday. No suspension this time and you're a bit forgetful. How many times have you been inside? It's like asking a woman how many time she's done it. When was your first time behind bars? - A long time ago, before the war. - Under the Germans too? - Yes, during the occupation too. - So you're an old jailbird. What about leaving it to someone younger? But you won't give up, you're a right old thief. What do you mean, thief? I don't steal. I only borrow things. I can't give them back if they keep me in prison. Now they'll also give you some education. - What do you mean, education? - It's meant as a treatment... - ...for chronic alcoholics. - I won't survive that. Don't forget, today's Saturday, you go on Tuesday. I don't want to chase all over for you. Rigo, Rigo, bad dog! Stop it! Get lost! Come here, little one! I'll give you a beating, you little terror! Get lost! Wait! You're normally in one place. You're a far cry from a nice full moon. Hello, doggie... What are you doing? Lead me home. She's asleep. So you're drinking even more now? You know very well I'm on your conscience. Don't worry, don't call anyone. You were afraid of the Germans, so you divorced me, right? And now your conscience is taking over. It's thirsty and you keep drinking till the devil comes to get you. But I've forgiven you. Stop it! You wouldn't like me to look at yours! - That was... - Keep going. Hello. - Hello there, welcome. - Hello. You look like a groom. She brings bad luck to every man. The first one had an accident and Bertin was shot. Who knows what's in store for Joska? ...when such a bonnie boy came for you. Slowly, but surely, keep on dancing, my little one, careful, just swinging gently, not to make your lassie tired. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Listen, I have to go and see about something. Alright? - Come back soon. - I'll be right back. Hello. Here's the clock, madam. I've repaired it, as I promised. That's great. Sit down. I've made a good job of it. It'll outlive us both. What have you done to your foot? I smashed it into a log, but it's alright now. But it still feels a bit funny. You want to be careful with that, you might get gangrene. You should see a doctor. Oh no. Weeds like me keep growing, madam teacher. If he'd been born in better times, he would've been a famous inventor. A great talent amongst the people has died, a technical genius and, if you pardon me, Joska, our own thief, our Lithpy. You'll always remain in our memory, Joska. Autumn 1951 When did you last come to confession? A long time ago, when I got married. I'm not sure if it was any good. So we'll have to go by the book. Yes please, I can't remember it all. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Sometimes, but not always. They took my Jewish wife away for good, so I think he isn't actually up there. But when I'm messing around in the pub, I think he's watching me. Thou shalt not take the name of God in vain. Do you often take the name of the Lord in vain? I've somehow got into this bad habit. - Remember the Sabbath, to keep it holy. - I do, every Sunday, mostly in the pub. - Honour thy father and thy mother. - Even beyond the grave. - Thou shalt not kill. - Neither flea nor chicken! Anča steals and kills them for me. - Thou shalt not commit adultery. - Do not ask me about that, reverend father. - Who with? - I can't remember. How many times? I don't know. I did in thought, true, but in deed... well, that as well. - Thou shalt not steal! - Not a thing! Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. I've never been in court. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife. The same as for number six. - Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house. - Like the seventh, not a thing. I see you're a great sinner. Strengthen your failing faith in God. Think of him watching you day and night, at home and in the field. You'll pray eighteen Hail Marys. Promise me to come at least once a year to confession and ten times a year to church. Dammit, I can't promise you that. reverend father. Why not? I'm not asking that much for so many sins, am I? I'm a wretch and easily shaken with the wind. I can't promise what I can't fulfil, dammit. Dammit... and stop swearing! Silence, please. No moving about. The leaves... The leaves are fading on the aspen tree. The leaves are fading on the aspen tree. When they're dry, they'll fall. If I fade like the leaves. If I fade like the leaves. I'll fall... Read my fortune. I won't read yours. - No? But you will František's. - Any time he wants to. - I don't believe in that stuff. - Give her your hand, come on. St. Francis was also a martyr. You've got a difficult life ahead of you. There are bars in your lifeline like a hospital or prison. - Your lifeline's interrupted. - Don't frighten him. Tell me how I'm going to end up. I won't. I'll tell you, alright? The time that's to come won't be mine. But you, you've got everything ahead of you. Carry on then! - Tell me, tell me too! - And then me, pray tell! I can't read all your palms! - Tell me what's ahead of me! - And I want to know it too! Down he goes! Come tomorrow. Here's my hand, tell me! Stop it! And you wash your hands. Come one by one! What are you doing here, you devil? Who let you go? Stand still. Stop! Don't move! So he'd had his fill of drunken good will, Zášinek. As if he felt he hadn't been made for the times to come. June 1952 - God be with you. - And with you. There's something wrong with me and I don't know what. Goodbye. He doesn't realise he's old. That strength isn't eternal just as man isn't. You're on your last legs. But who'd have the courage to tell you? We seized Kurfiřt's farm, then we got Zášinek's. When you join the cooperative, you'll soon see it flourishing. Moreover, Soviet agricultural science is coming up with useful discoveries, such as grassland crop rotation or subsurface tillage. Let us rally our ranks! No more whoa there, only giddy up! That's enough of all that sweet talk. The cooperative is more than 2 million in debt. All Zajvala's after is holding important positions. As for myself and those present - no way! - As long as he's here, we won't persuade them! - My thoughts entirely! - Come with us! - What have I done? - We'll discuss that elsewhere. - At least let me finish mowing the meadow. Someone else can do it. My 80-year-old blind father or my four small children? There's no time to waste. I've never left anything unfinished. Everything needs time. So I'll finish my job today as well. But no one says "František is innocent, let him go". Well then, men, sign it. Come on, Pepek! When we get together, such good farmers like you... - With you, we'll all be dragged down. - You've been bone idle all your life! But if we get good farmers like you, there's no way we couldn't prosper. I won't sign it. I won't. Come on, Kejvala! Sign it! So you won't sign? You won't? - Václav! - Sign it! Sign it! - What about you, Janek? - Won't you sign it? Sign it. If you don't sign, Pepek, you'll disappear one day! Please, let's have a talk. You took František away like a villain... so what else do you want? I won't let you go unless you sign! Twelve apostles. I still don't know if they'll be any good. They'll run off like a pack of rabbits. You won't be able to hold them, I see it in their eyes. And he was right - they all ran off. Christmas 1954 Go away. Oh, Arik! Come on, help me. Come on, come here! Comrades, I'll pay it all back. I'll even go down the pit, just don't ruin me. I'm only human. You're lucky, you wretch. We can't let this disgrace seep out. Do you realise how you've disgraced the Party? Peton, the new chairman of the local council came from Ostrava, where he was a director of a lunatic asylum. I do realise and I'm sincerely sorry. But the Party has compassion for its children. It'll give me a chance to make amends. You can't undo the shame. You must give back what you've stolen. But where do I get the money from? That's your problem! I haven't been stealing, I've only been borrowing. You built a whole house with Kurfiřt's wood! But what about Juchta's flat I allocated to you? Including the confiscated furniture and other things? It was for free. What furniture? Don't put that down, that's libel. You can go now. And put that down! I'm only human. Everyone makes a mistake once in his life. Don't blubber, we're not after your blood. Who will replace him then? - Why me, don't make me leave my trade. - You have to, there's no one else. My Dad was a bricklayer and so was my Granddad. So why pick me? Your time has come. - Wait outside until we've finished. - It's too late now for waiting. František's given them the slip and is very ill. How are we supposed to help him if he's run away? How? How? Since it was you who put him behind bars, you help him out. At least you can try and make up for what you'd done to him. What's wrong with him? The doctor says he's feverish and has water on the lungs. If he's arrested again, he won't survive the transport. Come on, don't be so bleak. The doctor will give him a shot and the ambulance can take him back - there's a prison hospital there . When you're struck down, you'll remember this! Don't threaten me, Kozina. How do I know you're not making this up? Just like the Germans! Even when a man's soul is leaving his body, he must be watched. Spring 1955 When František rose from the dead, they left him at home. He had neither money, nor livestock. But he borrowed some and bought a little horse. You're small but hardy, Burek. You're not getting any younger either. But we'll stick it out, since we've got this far. What do you think, Burek? Who do you think can take more? People or horses? Well, a man must stand more than a horse, Burek. Because he has to. Summer 1957 Nothing's so bad that it couldn't be worse. And nothing's so good that it couldn't be better. The grandparents died and Hanička was born. This year promised a good harvest. And František thought that everything was behind him. But the agitators came again to try and persuade him. You kept this land a secret. If you sign, you'll be forgiven. Do you think you'll be able to keep up, Janek? I'll never join. Never. Look, all the others have signed. When František does, I will too. - When František does. - When František does. After František has signed. We need you to sign. They're all holding back because of you. What have I got to do with it? You've got to, you see? You've got to change your mind. You treat people like cattle. Don't look round, keep going straight ahead! Stop looking around! They kept František at the station until they had all signed for fear that they would also be arrested. František didn't sign. My darling! Winter 1958 How about you, you dark one at the back, why do you stick your chin out so? The sun is the cause of my tanned skin. Had you not been in the sun, your skin wouldn't be so tanned now. The sun's like precious stones, since our Jesus Christ was born. Jesus is our Lord, forever and ever, amen. Here they come again. Don't let them sweet talk you. When you go under, no one will help you. We're the Magi and we come to you, wishing good health and happiness upon you, good health for many years to come, from far, far away have we come. - František, come and join us! - Don't avoid us. You're the only one who can take over. Come and join us! COOPERATIVE FARM You see, I always thought I'd never come here. What a mess you've made of this. Don't accept it, František! It is human to forgive old wrongs. They'll leave you in it again! Do you think you'll be able to manage it? Perhaps. They'll try to make a go at it if there's nothing else left for them. They've done you so much wrong. Or what man would that make you, if your son asks for bread, for you to give him a stone? Yes. And what if there are no horses next year... ...no sleighs... no bells. I know you'll accept it. - How do you know? - Because I know you. Rye brandy! Politics is filth! Wars will still go on and people will still kill each other until all that's left is a cow and bull... And they'll begin a greater posterity. Politics is filth! I've always fancied you. I should've married you. - Things would've turned out differently. - Another one ready for the grave. Politics is filth. You didn't know that before? Stop that. Look at me. They shot my Bertin to death and I haven't found anyone like him since. - Should I cry myself to death? - Ridi, paggliaccio... Just you wait and see how they prosper. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Epilogue - Plum brandy. - We haven't got any. - What have you got then? - Vodka. Give me Vodka then. LADIES - GENTLEMEN Plecmera? Our Father in heaven... I do look a state, don't I? The Grim Reaper's tried to get me six times. But I won't give in. I wash with cold water 30 times a day. You're working in a museum, aren't you? I do things I enjoy. So do I. I collect herbs and nothing else interests me. This is where I live now, old Klementek's place. I have to keep working so I have enough to eat, you see? You were married, weren't you? She was always running around. And František is not here anymore. Weeds never die. The better from amongst us leave. It's only the bad ones like us who stay. Maria? Apart from your hair you haven't changed at all. You're Hanička, aren't you? Your Dad would've been pleased! I'm not stopping long, I've got a concert in Olomouc. I didn't know your Dad was... What was it he said before he... He said he shouldn't have accepted it. He believed they'd try and make a go of it. But eventually they left him on his own. When he was sad he told me to go to the field and listen for singing. Everything's different now. When they start singing, you'll hear it. This is your Rhodes. You make your bed, you lie on it. But was it our own bed we made? What could have been done and what couldn't? Goodbye, all my good countrymen. Goodbye, and if we don't meet again, let Fate run her course. THE END
