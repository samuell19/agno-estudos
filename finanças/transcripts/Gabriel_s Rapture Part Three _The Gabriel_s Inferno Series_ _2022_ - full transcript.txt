♪♪ ♪♪ Here's to your success at Harvard. Thank you. ♪♪ Are you satisfied with your thesis? No. If I had another year, it would be so much better... - Oh. - That's the right answer. Good for you. You know, students think they're far more talented than they actually are. You'd be a better student and a better scholar with another year of hard work. Now... we can move on to something else. I don't like it when people pry into my private life, so I leave others alone. In your case, I was dragged into something by David Harris. I'm not privy to everything that went on, nor do I want to be. You'll have a fresh start next year at Harvard, and no one will have an inkling of what transpired here. But until then, it would be wise not to draw any attention to yourself. You know, frankly, female graduate students are vulnerable with respect to their reputations. It's best not to give anyone the slightest suspicion that you haven't earned your accomplishments through hard work. Professor Picton... I swear I worked very hard in the Dante seminar. He didn't help me with my essay or give me any special treatment. I'm sure that's true. But you deceived me. And frankly, I'm a bit put out. I understand why I... I wasn't brought into your confidence. I'm sure Gabriel forbade it. I'm annoyed with him, too. But for reasons I won't divulge here, I owe him a debt. ♪♪ I know the difference between a Willoughby and a Colonel Brandon. I hope you do, too. [Paul] So I'm headed back to Vermont after graduation. You can drive with me. I can help you move. Thanks but my dad's going to help me move. Well, we could go together. We could spend a day in the farm, and then we could drive to Boston. Are you living in residence? I can't get into residence till August. I need somewhere to live before then. Well, my friend's brother goes to Boston College. Let me see if he knows a place you could sublet. You would help me move and find an apartment? [laughs] - I expect to be paid in beer. - I think I can do that. Who are they? Oh, that's my sister, Heather, on the left with her husband. And the other girl? That's Alison, my ex. Oh. She was working in Vermont and couldn't handle the long distance. We broke up a while ago. You're a good person. Maybe I shouldn't have said that. You should say whatever's on your mind. And for the record... I've always thought you were a good person too. Should we turn on the movie? Sure. - [door closes] - I'm so glad you could come. I wish I could have taken time off work to have visited you instead, but... I needed to get away anyway. Wedding planning almost finished? [laughs] Not quite. These are for Gabriel's apartment. - Oh. - [sighs] I would have mailed them to him, but... Jackass. Did you know that Gabriel was in Selinsgrove a couple of weeks ago? He went to my parents' house. One of the neighbors called my dad. Apparently he was up at all hours playing loud music and prowling around outside. I don't understand why he's doing this. He loves you. And that kind of love just doesn't disappear overnight. Maybe he loves his job more. Maybe he decided to go back to Paulina. [laughs] What? You can't believe that he would leave you for Paulina? I can believe anything. You really think that he would leave you for her? Up until a year and a half ago, they were still involved. - She's familiar territory. - [sighs] We're going to need something stronger. [laughter] [snorts] - Shhh. - What? [whispering] We're gonna wake up Aaron. He sleeps like a log. Listen. - [snoring] - [laughter] [sighs] I just don't think that Gabriel would leave you to keep his job. I think he would have gone up to you afterwards and said, "I love you, but we have to wait." And he would have said it in iambic pentameter because he can. He loves you. I refuse to believe otherwise. [slurring] If he loved me he wouldn't have left me. You want to call him? I left him a message. If he wants to talk to me he has to do it face to face. I'm not calling him again. [sighs] [gulping] [sighs] What if he sleeps with Paulina? Oh, I don't think he would do that and expect you to forgive him afterwards. If he's with someone else and you find out about it, you tell me. [sigh] Yeah. [heavy breathing] I'm sorry, I forgot. What did you forget? How to enjoy a blow job? [laughs] ♪♪ Oh!

Well, thank you for coming, Miss Mitchell. Please. So... How was your semester? It was... interesting. I asked to speak with you to find out whether you've had any other problems since the hearing. Dean Harris is wondering if Professor Emerson bothered you at all after the hearing. Did he call or email? Why do you care? You got what you wanted. He left. This meeting is an attempt to ensure that you've been able to proceed in your education without interference. He told me to stop contacting him and that it was over. That's what you wanted to hear, right? Congratulations on a successful year. And congratulations on being accepted to Harvard. I don't regret my relationship with him. Both of you were patronizing to me throughout this entire process. I understand the importance of protecting someone who needs protection but the only people I needed protection from were you. [indistinct voices] [church bells in distance] Excuse me. Uh, I'm looking for the Foro Romano and the Museo... Archeologico. It's on via del Portico too. It's about a 12 minute walk. - Okay. - Uh, that way. Well, thanks. You know, I want to see it before we head to Florence tomorrow. Oh. Florence is lovely. Beautiful sights to see. Yeah, well, my family will be staying there for two months, but I'm afraid we won't have much time for sightseeing. Oh, how come? Well, we're staying with the Franciscans and will be volunteering in a medical clinic. Franciscans can always use a little help. - Oh, I'm not Catholic. - Oh, neither are we.

I'm sure circumstances will arrange themselves so that you meet eventually. But if they don't promise me that you'll drop by the Department of Romance Studies at B.U. before September. I will. Thank you. I don't know what I would have done. You've graduated with honors. Your thesis is solid and hopefully will form the basis of a fine dissertation. I look forward to watching your career. Thank you. I think you'll be very happy in Cambridge. You can drop me an email now and then, let me know how you are. Oh. This belonged to Dorothy L. Sayers.

I got an email from Professor Martin yesterday. - Emerson quit. - What? When? I don't know. He said he'd still supervise my dissertation. At least that's what Martin said. I didn't want to upset you, I just thought you should know. - Where's he going? - I have no idea. I think Martin's pissed. After all the shit Emerson put the department through, he up and quits.

Lying does not become you, professor. So we're back to that, are we? Julianne and the professor? From what you told the hearing officers, we never left it. You're the professor, I'm the student. You seduced and dumped me. - I sent you messages. - What messages? The calls you never made? The letters you never wrote. What about the letters from Abelard to Heloise? The photo of our orchard. I put the book in your mailbox myself. I didn't know the textbook was from you. I only looked at it tonight. I told you to read Abelard's letters. No, you said read my sixth letter. I called you Eloise. Wasn't it obvious? Eloise was seduced and abandoned by her professor. Your message was crystal clear. Okay. Forgive me. I need to explain myself. We should go inside. I need to change. [thunder] Are you changing schools? What? No. Paul gave this to me. He went there for his master's, remember? I gave you a sweatshirt once. What do you think about Boston University? Katherine told me to introduce myself to the Dante specialist in the Department of Romance Studies, but I haven't got around to it. I've been busy. I'm the new Dante specialist at Boston University. That isn't the response I was hoping for. So... You're... Here to stay? It depends. I'm a full professor now. University wanted to be able to attract graduate students in Dante studies so they... They cross appointed me with religion. Surprising, isn't it? What is? That a man who spent his life running away from God... Should become a professor of religion. I'm sorry I missed your graduation. Catherine sent me photos of you. You looked beautiful. [sets glass down] The picture you used to keep on your dresser. The one of us at Lobby. Did you take it with you? Yes. How did you know that? I noticed it was missing when I went looking for you.

When you showed up outside my apartment, I didn't know whether to hit you or kiss you. You broke my heart. I struggled through therapy for a while, but came out stronger than I ever thought I could. It was only through Catherine and Paul's kindness that I got through this. Fucking Paul You're not allowed to curse him. Why didn't you call me? I couldn't talk to you. I was told the dean would interview you prior to your graduation, and he would ask if you heard from me. You're a lovely woman but you're a terrible liar. I had to send messages in code. Our last night together, you wouldn't talk to me. What was I supposed to think? I thought I could court you while you were my student. And get away with it. I was wrong. Forgive me. I thought you chose your job instead of me. My goal was not to hurt you. I screwed up when I submitted Catherine's grade for your work. The administration was worried you'd been awarded that grade because you were sleeping with me. They were going to suspend your grade while they investigated, and as long as your grade was incomplete, you wouldn't be able to graduate. No Harvard. My selfishness is what led to all of this. And when you confessed, you provided the corroboration the committee needed. We had an agreement to show a united front. They were threatening your future, Julianne. Did you expect me to sit there and watch it happen? I agreed to their sanctions if they brought the investigation to a speedy conclusion. I promised I'd do anything. Anything? They told me to end things with you. To cease all contact. If I violated this condition, the agreement would be void and they would reopen the investigation into both of us. That's when you sent that cruel email. I was sending it from my university account to your university account. I assumed you'd realize it was all for show. [gasps] Have I ever spoken to you like that before? I mean, have I ever spoken to you like that since I realized who you were? Jeremy thought if I took a leave of absence, he would convince Christa to drop the lawsuit and he did.

I broke his heart. I took no pleasure in doing so. You know... Those days in Italy with you... were the happiest days of my life. That's why I returned. I even went to Assisi. To become a Franciscan? Hardly. I visited the Basilica. Your doppelganger led me to the crypt where I was confronted by my sins. I had made an idol of you. I told myself I needed you to save me. I began to realize I'd been given chance after chance and... through no goodness of my own, I'd been given love. And grace. And had thrown it away. I realized you couldn't save me. And I found peace. God wraps the world in second chances and sticky little leaves. My experience caused me to focus on God but also to love you more. I've always been attracted to your goodness. I love you more deeply now than before. I thought I knew what was best for us. What was best for you. I thought we had all the time in the world. Forgive me.

I want to make vows to you before God and... and stand in front of our families and... make promises to you. I can't contemplate marrying you. I need to learn how to be with you again. Frankly, I'm still angry. My intention is not to rush you. I've missed the connection we had. I haven't felt whole without it. I haven't either. Our last time together... you told me it felt like I'd fucked you. Next time I have you in my bed, I want you to know without a doubt, that our union is born of love not lust. That goal can be realized without getting married. If you don't think you can trust me enough to marry me then maybe you should let me go. - Is that an ultimatum? - No. But I want to prove myself to you. And you need time to heal. Withholding sex so I'll marry you is manipulative. I'm not withholding sex. Shouldn't I be allowed to wait until our relationship is repaired and have that choice respected? But... what about make-up sex? Isn't that customary? Oh... is that what you want? On our honeymoon you will find me a most attentive lover. All my arts will be at your service.

[kiss] Thank you for your gift. My gift? Your body alluringly wrapped up just for me. And your shoes. They must be very uncomfortable. Hardly noticed. And why is that? Cause all I could think about was making love with you. Your body recognizes me, Julianne. It knows my touch. I'm going to take all my time. [gasps] More vigorous activities will come later.
