No… it’s just that... ...we don’t talk much lately Teenagers You Know… You are so annoying Juan… Paula! is that you? dad? No… it’s just… that you scared us Eh! Speak for you! Where were you peeing? The end of the world? Close enough hope I get lost So… are you enjoying the camping day?

Mind your tongue! Ah! The Reina Sofía hospital thing... sure... The media is always creating fear to sell more That’s exactly what I’ve said Yesterday they said that it was probably premeditated So what? I don’t get who’d want to set fire to a hospital or why An angry employee? the seas of fire was the laboratory there isn't always a conspiracy Things happen and that’s it Life isn’t a… Polanski’s... screenplay I believe things happen for a reason I’m really sorry Juan I agree Ah perfect! right?

You know perfectly well that we can’t take things for granted Yeah… but... What? I’m sick and tired We stick to a stupid routine and sometimes it’s not even necessary but that stupid routine is what keeps us alive But can’t you see that there’s nothing outside? There’s no-fucking-body ok. Keep it down sorry… I’m tired… more than usual me too… but I’m starting to worry about your attitude I’d like you to be honest with me It’s better for the two of us. but… What’s the point of this shit?

Do you want to become one of them? Wait Now! What the hell was that about?
