[music playing] Hey! Morning, Steve. STEVE: Good mornin'. Hey, I heard it was a nice day, huh? STEVE: That remains to be seen. [dance music playing] MAN: I hope I'm the first one here-- [inaudible] here on the S train. You know, there's no [inaudible]. Hey are you guys that are looking for the accompaniment. That bag upstairs told me to come down here. That bag upstairs is my lover. That's just an expression. OK, you play piano? Play piano? Hey, you guys can be straight with me. What do you mean straight? You don't have to use any of that fancy stuff around me. It's cool. -What do you mean cool? It's cool. I've been around. I've been around a long time. It looks like it. It shows, huh? So it does. Wanna check out the merchandise, right? Merchandise. Yeah, but I tell you right now. I don't go down. And I don't go for no whips, OK? I guess [inaudible] know right up front. Look, Spartacus, we really don't have to see what you look like. Your magnificence shows through. Unfortunately, we've hired a priest who's left the cloth this morning. And I also play a terrific piano. I know that. Oh, that's a good way to start my career. You have to start somewhere. Continental baths. [inaudible]. It's very famous. Oh yeah? Oh, famous for what? Decadence. [music playing] Hi, there. You must be here for the audition. Yes, I am. [gasps] I just knew it! You all look so, so, so sensitive and these hands! I can just see scads of lovely little notes leaping from those long, soft creative fingers! [inaudible]. Do you work here? Well, you might say that, but when I meet someone like you, it's pure pleasure. And I just love artistic hands! Can I have my-- my hands back, please? I need them to play! I love to play. The piano! Are you here to play piano? Yes. Good luck, dear. And if they don't want you, I do. Just rap on room 346. But be gentle. [piano music playing] Is that the kind of thing you mean, like modern popular night clubbing? MAN: Yeah, yeah, that's it. Play it. Oh good. Play "September Song." [music - "september song"] WOMAN: Oh darling, that's lovely. Can you play "Love Story"? Play "Love is Blue." Bitch. [piano music playing] OK, what'd you say your name was? Uh, Micheal Lawrence. Michael Lawrence. Yeah. Congratulations. Scotti! Scotti's my manager. He's gonna work out the details with you, OK? OK. Michael , am I glad to meet you. The job pays $150 for the show. Is that OK with you? Terrific! That's great. But that includes two rehearsals. -Fine. -Fabulous. Let's go over here and talk. OK, Michael. This is the rest of your music. I suppose you've worked in enough clubs to know what to do. By the way, where have you played? Uh, a couple of places. Any place in particular? I'm from Montana and I've only been in New York a few months. You should have no trouble handling the show. OK. I hope so. What time's rehearsal? 11 AM sharp. Wait a minute. I didn't get your name and address. Oh, right. Michael Lawrence, L-A-W-R-E-N-C-E. Uh, 989-4720. 110 South Houston Street. Fantastic. You live in SoHo. Yeah. A friend of mine is opening up a gallery in your neighborhood tonight. Drop by. Well. You'll meet some very interesting people and it'll give us a chance to, uh, get to know each other. Well, if I can, you know. No matter. If you're busy, you're busy. Say, I get off work in a half hour. If you can, uh, stick around, maybe we can grab a bite to eat. No, listen-- There's this fantastic Italian place-- My old lady's expecting me home. Your old lady? You live with your mother? [chuckles] No, a woman. Tracy. Tracy's her name. So you live with a girl. Yeah. Are you lovers or just roommates? No, mates. Are you married? MICHAEL: No. So you're not really gay. No, I'm not. Could-- could I have some water? Sure. Michael, let me ask you this right out. Thank you. Have you ever made love with a man? What? Have you ever had sex with a man? Well, um, sure. You know, when I was younger. What do you mean younger? Well, I had a-- listen, man, I'd really rather not talk about it right now. OK, OK, that's cool. Do I still have the job? Are you kidding? What does sex have to do with your playing the piano? Nothing, I hope. Here nobody forces anybody do anything, OK? Don't let the place get you uptight. Nobody's going to attack you. It's just this place is very strange. Montana's my idea of a strange place, Michael. Yeah, OK, but it doesn't have all of these lights and mirrors and waterfall and-- Queers? Yeah. We call them fags in this city. I guess that's kind of silly. Hey, look. You and I have to work together. I'm in the show too. I'm the MC. Oh yeah? You can still play the piano. Hey, listen. I'm always able to play the piano. Then I know you'll be great. Thank you. Don't thank me. I needed a piano player. Oh, listen. In case you can make that party, it's at 140 South Houston Street around 10 o'clock. Bring Tracy. I think I'd like to meet her. OK, maybe I will. See you later. Bye. TRACY: Hi, Michael! Mm, hey, baby! TRACY: How'd it go? What? The audition! Oh, it was interesting. Did you get the job? You did, didn't you? Yeah, I did! Oh, I knew it! How much? 150 big ones! Oh, terrific. You can pay your half of the rent. Oh, wonderful. That makes working with fags kinda worth it. Oh, Michael. Don't be so negative. You know, a lot of important people go to the baths. You [inaudible] and there. Yeah, it's got to be different Saturday night. Yeah, it will be. I'll be there. Oh, that'll be nice. You don't mind? It won't [inaudible]. No, no. It'll make me feel better if you are there. Why's that? Well, I don't want to have any more to do with those people than I have to. What's so bad about them? They're fags. What could be worse than that? Michael! Well, you know, they keep looking at me, coming onto me, and making me feel like a woman. Oh yeah, do they grab ya? Well, as a matter of fact, the manager made a pass at me. He's got great taste. Well, that's true. You can't blame him for trying. You have the wavy blond hair. Mm. And those blue eyes. In fact, I think I want to get it on with you myself. Yeah? [chuckles] Listen, seriously. How can I get them to stop coming onto me? I think it's a matter of vibes. You might not be sending out the right signal. What the hell does that mean? What's the matter? I tell you I'm a little nervous, and the next thing I know you're telling me I'm a closet queen. TRACY: I did not say that. OK, now let me go. You're not getting up. Hey, let me go! Uh-uh. Not letting you up. What-- you don't think I can break out. What's the magic word? I don't fuck with ladies. That's the magic word. [laughs] Come on, let go. No. [laughs] Michael, Michael! [laughs] (GERMAN ACCENT) I fix the [inaudible]. [laughs] (GERMAN ACCENT) You are secure now, huh? Yeah, I love it. (GERMAN ACCENT) You-- I got myself a fraulein. You know, I am not really a sheik. My name is Fritz. I am hiding out here in the desert. And you know, I am going to make you say "uncle. No, you're not. (GERMAN ACCENT) Yeah, you will say "uncle." No, I won't. (GERMAN ACCENT) Yeah, you will say "uncle." [laughs] Mmm. -(GERMAN ACCENT) Uncle? -No. (GERMAN ACCENT) No? TRACY: [laughs] (SINGING) When you [inaudible]. Uncle? TRACY: No! (GERMAN ACCENT) And are you going to run? I'll pelt you all over your body. You will say uncle. Uncle. Uncle! (GERMAN ACCENT) Uncle? Cousin? -Cousin. (GERMAN ACCENT) Ah. Say "yeah"? Yeah. [laughs] Mmm. [inaudible] [gasps] Allah be praised. The great gate! [laughter] But I know why why they were coming onto you. Why's that? They probably heard how good you are in bed. You've been writing on bathroom walls again? Nope. Subway. [laughs] "Michael Lawrence is a great lay" in fluorescent pink is roaring up Broadway right this moment. [laughs] Hey. Hmm? Tell me about the manager that's coming onto you. Oh my dear [inaudible] is four inches long and the sequin dress and here all the way to his waist. [laughs] He's really faggoty, huh? No. Actually he was-- he was a nice looking guy. Had on jeans and cowboy boots. He looked Chris from Montana. He doesn't sound so bad. No, he wasn't. He was the straightest looking dude there. Matter of fact, I'd never known he was gay except there was something in the way he kissed me. -What was his name? -Deborah. [laughter] No, Scotti. Oh, by the way. He told me there's a party right down the street tonight. -Oh yeah, party? -Mhm. Let's go. OK. Can I go? Oh sure. He said he'd to meet you. Well, I'd like to meet him too. OK, I'll take you under one condition. What's that? We've got to behave like adults. Of course. Ready? Sure. Hop on. MAN: First he takes off his leather boots, plastic, Naugahyde. MAN: Yeah. MAN: Then he doubles his price. MAN: Yeah. Well? MAN: Well, what? Then he sanded it down and painted it henkeek yellow. MAN: How'd it look? MAN: Beautiful, and old. Yeah, they're weird, but I think I know what he's after. I know what he's after. What's that? A quick buck. [laughs] Good Lord, look at that. How could anybody do that to their bodies? Oh, here comes the manager [inaudible]. Hey, Michael. Really glad you could make it. This must be Tracy. -Hi. Don't say a word about the pictures. This is the photographer, Bruce. -Hello. It's Michael. Hi, Bruce. Hi, Michael. Hi, Bruce. Tracy, how are you? Love your photographs. Thank you very much. It's a real hassle, putting a show like this together. I know. I've been through it myself. I barely make the punch myself. Oh, it's delicious. -Hey, you like it? -Yeah. -Why don't you have some more? -[inaudible]? -Yes, love it. -Bruce, let me get you a drink. OK. A really good thing did come out of it, though. What's that? My agent found a publisher who's willing to put a book together. That's great. My agent hasn't done anything for me in ages. Hi, Scotti. Hiya, kids. Well, he was 200 pounds of dynamite. [inaudible]. You like that, huh? Mm. Very nice. Tracy's lovely. Oh, thank you. They're not even sexual. I don't think sexuality is their objective. How do you like Bruce's work. It's all right. Do you like it? With reservations. I think I know what you mean. Hey, Scotti, can I speak to you? It's kind of important. -Sure. I'm sorry, Michael. Excuse us. No problem. WOMAN: Do you honestly think arms go with punch? Anybody that spends that much time developing their body can't be productive. WOMAN: Productivity is socially subjective. MAN: Any [inaudible] like that can [inaudible]. WOMAN: Can't the word "sexuality" [inaudible]. Did you look at him? [laughs] What's wrong with him? It's kind of obvious, isn't it? Well, it's not obvious to me. Hey, baby, I want to go home. Hmm? Oh, don't you want to stay for a few minutes? No, I've got a lot of practice I need to do [inaudible]. Would you mind if I do? No. OK. I'll see you there. I'll say goodbye to Scotti for you. OK. So long, Michael. You're not a Virgo. Right. And you're not a Capricorn? Uh-uh. Taurus? There's a guy over here wants to write you a check. [laughter] Oh, thank you. I'll get right over there. Did you study photography at Oberlin? Well, I did-- I started out as a hobby, but, um, how'd you know I went to Oberlin? Michael told me. Oh. By the way, you two make a beautiful couple. Oh, thanks, the Bobbsey twins. Is, uh, marriage in the cards? --[laughs] Only if my mother [inaudible]. SCOTTI: [laughs] How about another drink? TRACY: No thanks. I forgot to eat dinner. SCOTTI: How could you forget to eat dinner? TRACY: Because Michael and I were celebrating because he got the job. Oh you were celebrating. [laughter] I'm the one that should be celebrating. I needed a piano player. Oh, well, he won't let you down. I see. They were Michael's favorites too. He'll be here in a second. -He's got great taste. -Mhm. Hi, Scotti. Haven't seen you in a while. It's been a long time, Eva. Tracy, this is Judith and Eva. Hi. What do you do, Tracy? I'm a photographer. Oh, Judith and I are models. We could use some new material. Would you like to take us? Sure. I'd love to. Tonight? Well-- [laughs] Sorry, dears. I'm taking her home tonight. Oh, well good luck. Good night, Tracy. Good night. Good night, ladies. Scotti, I've got to go home. Because if I drink any more, you're gonna have to carry me. You may have to carry me home at this point. No, no, no. It's only a couple of blocks. I'll crawl. Oh, far out. I can use the fresh air. I haven't talked to a woman in ages. Oh, [inaudible]. Uh, no. [inaudible]. Uh. Do you know what it means to share? [laughs] No, but I think it's the guy. [laughter] You better [inaudible]. It's from Alabama. Far out. See this, one, two, three, four-- 425. You know how many there are? Uh-huh. I live here. Oh, oh you live here? -Yes. -Oh. We're here. Yep, you want to come up? [piano music playing] That was great! Thank you. Guess who I brought home! I see. Hi, Scotti. How you doing, Michael? Why, I-- I think I'm gonna go see if there's anything to eat. --[laughs] Well, how 'bout some eggs? That sounds great. TRACY: OK! I just wanted to see that Tracy got home all right, you know? Yeah, it looks like she needs it. Thank you. TRACY: How 'bout omelets? I'll have a western! TRACY: [laughs] Uh, sit down, Scotti. Thank you, Michael. Would you like some wine? Oh, great. Excuse me. Sure. Say, where's the bathroom? Right here. Oh, far out. What'd you bring him here for? Fill 'er up. [laughs] Who? Scotti Oh, Michael, he's so nice. He's too nice, you slut. SCOTTI: Hey, you guys talking about me in there? Yep. Oh, no, just getting the wine. SCOTTI: You need any help? No, that's, uh, all right. Did you really get this piano for $50, Michael? Yeah, I really did. It was a bitch getting in here, though. I'll tell ya. I can imagine. You play? I thought I did until I heard you. Well, I've been at it for 15 years [inaudible]. Have you ever played "The Gape" before? --[chuckles] Uh, as matter of fact, I played it for recital one time. Far out. I knew nobody could sight read that piece. Ready on the eggs. So [inaudible]. [chuckles] These eggs look great. [laughter] Thanks I made them myself. Hey, Scotti, how'd you get started at the baths? Well, I met Steve and his wife one summer out on Fire Island. Steve's married? Yeah, he has two children. Really? Yeah, quite a few of the guys at the baths are married. No kidding. Well, listen, what do their wives feel about that? What do you mean? What do I mean? Well-- [laughs] Don't they-- don't they care? I really don't suppose they know, Michael. Oh, come on, Scotti. How could they not know? A lot of guys have mistresses without their wives knowing. OK, man, that's a different thing, you know? Oh I suppose you're right, Michael. You know, as soon as you've had a gay experience, it's impossible to function with women. --[laughs] Honey, that's ridiculous. Have some more wine. Sure. You need it. [laughs] Hey, me too! Jesus, I've got a lot of catching up with you guys to do, huh? That's OK, Michael. I've got the ketchup. [laughter] Hey, let's get rid of these plates. Yeah, let's get away from these eggs. TRACY: Ketchup for-- I get it! [laughs] Bless her heart. Hey, Michael? Hmm? You know, you should've stayed at the gallery. Why's that? Because the two brunettes. Yes. Well, they wanted to take me home. Only-- only Scotti brought me here instead. Wait a minute, they were gay? [laughter] They were women. [laughter] How much did you pay for that, Scotti? [laughs] What-- what were they like? Hey. I don't know. I didn't get to find out. [laughter] They're not to be believed. You know 'em? Sure I know 'em. [laughs] Wait. What? What? You want their number? You got it? [laughs] I've got it. You gonna hold that all day, or you-- I'm sorry. I got it. I meant I've got the number. Who cares? Scotti, how do you know them? Huh? Well, it's a long story. Oh, I want to hear it! Oh, once upon a time-- no. [laughs] Seriously. Not too long ago, a friend of mine gave me a call and invited me over to his place. This is an invitation that I don't turn down, because every time I go over there, there's always something different happening. So I arrive. Never says a word to me, just smiles, leads me in. I'm in the living room, and before my eyes, those two brunettes are making love right in the middle of the floor. They were so involved, the lovemaking was so passionate, that he'd probably been there and split and seen me at the door and gone back, and they didn't even know he'd split. The feeling was incredible. The pull was so intense that from the moment I walked into his place, I was involved. I mean, I had to become part of the situation. There was no way out. He just sort of left me there, like to watch, which was more than I could handle. Before I knew it, we were all involved, a unity, you know, four people, but in union with one another. It was-- I don't know how to describe it. It was like, uh, those rare moments when with strangers passion mingles with love and trust, Michael. You know? Scotti. Yeah? Uh. I don't, uh, I don't think I can handle this right now. That's OK, Michael, really. I understand. I have to go anyway. Yeah, I really do. OK. Good night, Tracy. Thank you. Yeah. Uh, see you tomorrow. 11, right? Yeah. Hey, I hope everything is all right. Oh, it's all right. OK. I'll see you later. Good night, man. Michael? Michael? Time to wake up. [sighs] You up? Mm. What time is it? 9:20. [inaudible]. [sighs] Hey, I got a terrific idea. Huh? I want French toast. Good. Call me when they're ready. [yawns] [dance music playing] Steve! What? Can you close it here for a second, please? How you doing, Michael? Listen, please forgive me. I'm a little caught up. Look, there's a problem I've got to straighten out with-- there's a problem I've got to straighten out with Judy Garland. Can you entertain Michael for a few minutes? Sure, why not? Thank you, Steve. Dennis. Hello. Dennis and [inaudible]. Dennis, I want you to meet Michael. Hi. How are you? I heard you yesterday. You really play good. Thank you. Scotti tells me you're straight. I guess I am. That sounds promising. Dennis never met anybody that was straight. If he did, I think it would destroy his ego. Honey. Yeah? They were all straight until they met me. Isn't that true, Steve? Oh. Uh, the dancers are all beat. Can we take a break? What? Can we take a break, Steve? The dancers are beat. So, go ahead. Michael. Michael, have you ever seen the dance? I guess not. Scotti, why don't you take him around. Do you want to see it? I think he should. Love to. I'll hold your [inaudible]. OK. Far out. I think you're gonna find this very interesting. Fascinating. SCOTTI: What doesn't appeal to you? MICHAEL: Voyeuristically, it's a terrific thing to write home about. [laughter] SCOTTI: I had my whole family here a couple of times. MICHAEL: Are you kidding? SCOTTI: No, it was outrageous. It was outrageous. MICHAEL: Do they know you're, uh-- SCOTTI: I mean, yeah, they're very proud that I'm a manager, as a matter of fact. MICHAEL: [laughs] SCOTTI: But, uh. MICHAEL: It must be a relief to have, you know, a place to come where you don't have to worry about your cover being blown. You know what I mean? SCOTTI: It is, [inaudible] your only cover is your towel. MICHAEL: [laughs] Are there any air ducts you walk over they go [inaudible]. [laughs] SCOTTI: Yes. [laughter] MICHAEL: Uh, would you mind pointing them out to me? The air ducts? SCOTTI: Yeah, as soon you get into a towel, I'll walk you across one. [laughter] By the way, if you see a few people cruise you around here, you really can't blame them. That doesn't get you uptight, does it? What are you doing for lunch today? MICHAEL: Oh, I told Tracy to meet me. We thought we'd try that place around the corner. SCOTTI: Terrific. That's one of my favorite places. Why don't you be my guests today? [piano music playing] [woman singing] That was perfect! Really? Think you can do that at the show? If you can sing it like that, I can play it. Ah, you're gonna be so easy to work with. Thank you. That was beautiful. Come on, let's go to lunch. Gee, I'd like to, but I can't. Come on, Michael, let's go. Sure, why not? Great. [dance music playing] So why don't you guys come out to the game tonight? What game? The football game. Continental Bath is playing the New York City Athletic Club. Get out! No, we really are. Do you mean that the Continental Bath has a football team? Yes. And you're probably captain. Who's [inaudible]? Oh, I don't know if you've ever heard of him, Judy Garland, Dianna Ross. I've heard. Shirley [inaudible]. [inaudible] And Michael's playing [inaudible]. [indiscernible chatter] They've got a shaving area. And in the shaving area is the water cooler, you know, with a tank on top, big bottle. Filled with red mouthwash. TRACY: [laughs] SCOTTI: No, no, that's not mouthwash. MICHAEL: What? SCOTTI: That's [inaudible]. [laughter] MICHAEL: Disco and jukebox, and the guys are there all-- what 24 hours a day, right? Hey, you guys are coming, I hope. You bet. Aren't we? I guess so. TRACY: Hey! SCOTTI: Do you like football? MICHAEL: Sure. I hate it. It's gonna be a great game. [indiscernible chatter] Geez. [band music playing] [cheering] [interposing voices] MAN: Fuck you, man, I'm going home. MAN: Hey, you think you can handle that, Frank? [interposing voices] [kissing sounds] [cheering] Hike! [grunting] MAN: Come on, come on, baby. All right, now come on. [clapping] MAN: Hike! [laughter] (SINGING) I've got music. I've got my man, who could ask for anything more? Two, three, mwah! [cheering] 44, 36, 25, eight, three, 45, 50! Go, Scotti, go! [cheering] MAN: Get him off me! How you doing? We're winning, of course. [laughs] I saw my best friends again. MAN: Yeah, really? You guys have been [inaudible] all the time. MAN: W'ere gonna show them this time. Break on three. Three, three. MAN: Come on! MAN: Very private, fellas. Oh, look how [inaudible]. [laughter] MAN: Geez. [interposing voices] MAN: Who's got my-- [interposing voices] MAN: You-- [interposing voices] MAN: Who got him? MAN: What's wrong with Grace? MAN: Come on, he's fakin' it. Oh! [laughter] [interposing voices] Oh, Michael, it looks like you're gonna play. Michael. Hey, hey, come on, fellas, geez. [laughs] [interposing voices] Now, we're gonna go down this way, see? One, two, three, that's it. That's it. All right. Here we go. Come on. Come on, come. Here we go. All right. 37, 45-- MAN: Oh shit! MAN: What's that [inaudible]? [interposing voices] [cheering] It was a great game. You got lucky. Well, we won. [laughs] Yeah, cheating. That's not fair. That is the sweetest team in the world. The fastest kissers on the block. You bet. Ah, you know, there's a lot of love in this park too. You know, the first time I ever made love was right here in this place? Yeah? Yeah. What was she like? It was very beautiful. What was she like? It was a he. Your first time was with a guy? Uh-huh. That's why you're not normal. Normal. What'd I say? You don't know? No, I just said that maybe-- That the most important experience in his life turned him into a sick pervert. Oh, I never said that. Geez. Well, what did you mean by normal? Normal is normal. A homosexual is not normal. Well, he doesn't seem so twisted to me. And he's been nothing but nice to you from the first day you met him. Look, OK. He's been nice to me. I like him and all of that, but, uh-- what's the matter? Well, a guy. I could never get close to a guy. I mean, a woman is something else. I just think that maybe you ought to open your eyes to the fact that you could relate to somebody like Scotti, somebody-- somebody who can love. I mean, like you're putting a-- a label on everything. And you're saying society says it's wrong, so therefore you go along with it. And you won't get close to it. And you won't even open yourself up to the fact that this might be a very honest-- Look, love and friendship is one thing, man, but I can-- I like Scotti, I told you that. But that's it. I mean, I could only like him up to a point. After that-- -What point? The sexual, you know, the-- his sexual preferences would be in the back of my mind. It would, uh, you know, cut a relationship off there. I don't see anything wrong with that. TRACY: Look, you don't have to feel threatened by him. Just because he's gay doesn't mean you have to go to be with him. You've really got to think some things over. I'm gonna go, all right? [knocking] Scotti? Hey. Hi. Are you busy? Sort of, getting ready for work. What's up? Oh, well, I'd like to talk to you. Can I come in? Well, OK. But I really don't think there's very much to talk about. Well, I think there is. I'd like to apologize. You really don't have to apologize, Michael. Excuse me while I get dressed. Uh, look, Scotti, about what I said in the park. Skip it. No, I don't want to skip it. I want you to know that I didn't mean it the way it sounded. What was it that you meant, Michael? Well, nothing, really. It's just conditioning. Bullshit. Am I really supposed to believe that you don't know what you're saying? No, I know what I'm saying. It's just it sometimes I-- what I say isn't really what I feel. What the fuck does that mean? Oh, come on, Scotti. You know what I'm talking about. How the hell do I know what you're talking about when you don't know what you're talking about-- Look, man, I came here to apologize. If you can't take that, the hell with it. OK, OK. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I realized what I said was stupid. We all say stupid things. But you've got to realized, man, where I'm coming from, see. Where I come from, what you do with fags is punch them in the mouth, see? Oh, does that make it right, Michael? No, but-- on an Air Force base, that's just the way it is, you know? Everybody's super butch. Is that where you're from? Yeah, yeah. And you know, everybody just talks like that. So I guess I've always been like that. Always? Well, maybe not always. I remember what I was 12 I-- I knew a guy who was a fighter pilot. His name was Greg, and he was a lot more sensitive than the rest of them, you know. He used to-- he kind of befriended me. Took me up in a trainer a lot of times, even let me have the stick. [chuckles] Oh, wow, for a kid, 12 years old, always wanted to be a pilot. I mean, and that was it. Anyway, to make a long story short, we would play football and went fishing. He even taught me how to shoot. One time we went trout fishing and hit a flash storm, came on us. We got really drenched. There was a cabin there, but nobody put any firewood inside. So we couldn't get a fire going and couldn't get dry. We took off all our clothes though. And there were a couple of blankets and we wrapped up in the blankets and tried to get warm. We had a couple of cans of sterno so we could make some soup. And we did, and it was terrific. But, uh, I still couldn't get warm, so, uh, we, uh-- he started rubbing my hands and my arm and my back. It wasn't a sensual-- then he put his arms around me. Uh, and that embarrassed me. Because I mean, I don't think my father ever-- ever hugged me. And I got into it. I really felt terrific. And I guess I went to sleep like that. The next thing I knew, man, I was flying across the room and lights were-- flashlights were in my eyes. And it was my father and a couple of non-coms with him, and they grabbed Greg and was pushing him around and yelling obscene things. You know, I mean they'd-- he flipped out. Anyway, lesson of the story is that I learned, you know, not to-- I learned not to put hands on other men, see? Did you love him? Yeah, I guess I did. You know, Michael, if it weren't for your old man, you'd be normal. [chuckles] --[chuckles] Hey, I really better be going. Will you walk me downstairs? Sure. [inaudible]. Live around here? Where've you been? I, uh, went over to Scotti's. Oh? Hey, we still friends? Don't be silly. You wanna go in? Yeah. I'm going to throw up. --[laughs] Come on, my dress can't be that bad. No, it's beautiful. Aw, thank you. Can you put this on. Oh, sure. Michael! --[laughs] Well, you look so sexy. Hey, I got a great idea. Why don't we forget about going tonight and just stay home and make love? OK. OK? You talked me into it. I did? You did. You're gonna hate me for this. But I think I'd really prefer if you stayed home tonight. Oh, come on, Michael. Can you help me put this on. No, I'm serious. I think I'd be more comfortable if you weren't there. You know what I mean? No, I don't. Would you mind terribly? Yes, I would mind. Really, why? Michael, I've been looking forward to it all week. I bought a new dress. I put on my makeup. Tracy, this is-- I've never done a gig like this before. My stomach's doing flips. I'd be more comfortable if you weren't there to hear my goofs. You can understand that, right? Michael you're gonna be great. You're just getting stage fright. Hey, come on. You're getting yourself all worked up over nothing. Nothing? Don't tell me what's in my head. You don't know what's in my head. Hey, come on. I'm all dressed up. I'm ready to go. I'm not staying home. Don't stay home. Who asked you to stay home? So now you don't give a damn? Oh, Tracy, come on. Don't come on to me. I honestly can't believe that you don't want me to be there tonight. Tracy, please, not tonight. Michael, if you need me, I'll be in my studio. [dance music playing] [cheering] Welcome to the Continental Bath and House Club. I'm really glad you came out tonight to have a good time with us. Our middle name is steam, and we have a really steamy evening here for you tonight. We have lots of surprises. Yeah, that's right, sugar. And the evening will go on and on. Ladies and gentlemen, can I be heard? Can everybody [inaudible] by the pool? [cheering] OK. [piano music playing] [applause] The incredible Janie Olivor. (SINGING) I wanna be a pretty girl and have easy kind of love. Wouldn't have to say much, wouldn't bend to your touch. Love would be so free and easy like a pretty girl. I want to go home where there's a peaceful world, wouldn't have to try hard. [inaudible] Hey, man! Make it easy for me, like the [inaudible]. Pretty girl. And have the easy love. [cheering] SCOTTI: Ladies and gentlemen, we have a lineup of stars for you in tonight's decadence that would challenge the galaxy we're in. Ladies and gentlemen, from England, Shirley [inaudible]. (SINGING) Morning and raise a little hell tonight. I've got the urge to corral and maybe raise a few brows, cut lose and pull all the stops. [clapping] [caribbean music playing] [singing in foreign language] [music playing] (SINGING) I know-- I know you must follow the sun wherever it leads, but remember, if you should fall short of your desires, remember life holds for you one guarantee. You'll always have me. [MUSIC "AIN'T NO MOUNTAIN HIGH ENOUGH"] [cheering] SCOTTI: Ladies and gentlemen, a very special treat. The one that got away, Judy Garland. [cheering] (SINGING) You'll feel blue. You'll feel sad. You'll miss the bestest pal you ever had. There'll come a time, now don't forget it. There'll come a time when you'll regret it. Oh, baby, think what you're doing. My love for you is gonna drive me to ruin. After you're gone, after you've gone, away! After you've gone and left me crying, after you've gone, there's no denying. SCOTTI: Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for the entire cast of [inaudible]. [cheering] [music playing] Wow, peace and quiet, man, nice. It's a good place to get away from it all. Yeah. Yeah, this isn't lover's lane. Sort of. I didn't see Tracy tonight. I asked her not to come. You're kidding? You didn't think she'd be uptight here, do you? [laughs] Not Tracy. Problems? No. Huh-uh. I don't know. Opening night jitters, I guess. SCOTTI: Nice, huh? MICHAEL: Beautiful. We take ourselves much too seriously. That's why it's all so complicated. Why don't you tell me what's really on your mind? I don't know how. I think you do. No, I'm not. Sure I can't talk you into staying? No, thanks. Uh, Tracy'll be expecting me. Why don't you give her a call? Well, the studio's right on the way home, so I thought I'd stop by. You really want to see her. Yeah, I do. That's cool. I can dig that. Let me throw on a shirt. I'll walk you downstairs, Michael. No, no, Scotti. That's OK, really. You sure? Yeah. I'm sure. OK. I'll see you tomorrow. OK. Goodbye. Bye now. I'm glad you're here. Hi. Is it new stuff? Old stuff. How was the show? It went very well. You gonna play there next week? Mhm. Was a late night. Yeah, well, Scotti and I got together afterwards. Oh? Where'd you go? His place. Anything happen? Yes. How-- how does that affect us? I don't know. I hope it doesn't. Let's go home. [music playing]
