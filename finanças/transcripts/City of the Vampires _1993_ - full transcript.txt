(dramatic music) (helicopter rumbling) - What is happening to the city of Braddock? Once a small but thriving community of over 200,000 residents, its population has declined to under 50,000 in just three short years. City officials blame the exodus on everything from the depressed economy to the ever-increasing crime rate. But whatever the reason, the residents of Braddock are remaining surprisingly silent. - I have nothing to say. I have nothing to say. - Well. - It's just not safe out there anymore. - [Florence] So you blame it on the city's crime rate? - Yeah, no, I mean, it's not like that. It's something different you just can't explain. Well, I'm leaving at the end of the month. Breaking the lease and everything. I'll probably go stay with my sister. She lives out in... - There's something out there. It's gripped the city, slowly choking the life out of us. We gotta... - Whatever the reason is, it definitely has the residents of Braddock scared. City officials can only speculate on how they're going to save their city. For Channel Nine News, this is Florence Straker. - In other news, one month after her disappearance, the search for Christine Rice has been called off. The young woman was abducted from a friend's car following a visit up north with relatives. Sam Helling, the driver of the car that night, could not be reached. (dramatic music) - Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! (vampire hissing) (vampire hissing) (mournful music) (Sam crying) (somber music) (glass shattering) (glass shattering) (bottle rattling) (dramatic music) (girl laughs) - Girl. (bulb shattering) (dramatic music) (girl screams) Help, help! God, somebody help me! (bright hopeful music) (dramatic music) (girl gasps) Mom, Mom! Open the door, open the door! (ominous music) Mom, Mom! Hurry, hurry! Let me in, Mom, let me in! Open the door, open the door! - [Mom] Get back, the chain's still on. - [Girl] Hurry, Mom, hurry! (girl screams) (flesh squishing) (baby crying) - Elizabeth? Elizabeth, Elizabeth! (dramatic music) - Sam? (eerie music) (ominous music) Sam, Sam, Sam! (Christine screaming) Come to me, Sam. I'm not lost yet. (Sam breathes heavily) - No! (somber music) (ominous music) Hey, hey, can you help me? (dramatic music) (ominous music) (mysterious music) This is where it all began. (bell tolling) (Sam breathing heavily) (ominous music) Wake up, wake up. Wake up. Look, have you seen this girl? This girl, have you seen her? - You got any spare change? (cat meows) (woman laughs) (dramatic music) (woman screams) (dramatic music) It's all right. It's okay, I'm a friend. (dramatic music) (woman screams) (woman laughs) - Well, hello, Mr. Helling, we've been waiting for you. - Let me guess, the news reports, right? - Oh no, sweetie. You girlfriend. - My girlfriend. What do you know about my girlfriend? - I know her in ways you never can. I love to come down here and pick on her a little every night, like a midnight snack. But they're not as good when they're dead. - No! (gunshot banging) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - We have kisses for you too, Mr. Helling. - Kiss this. (gunshot banging) (dramatic music) - [Man] Any spare change, Mr. Helling? (vampire hisses) (gunshot banging) - Hey, hey! (dramatic music) - Hello, my name is Mathison. (door rattling) One second. (metal scraping) (dramatic music) I hate to show them too many of my tricks. They'll have that dismantled by morning. Like I was saying, my name's Mathison. Come on. I like to save these for company. Don't worry about them, they can't get in. They're all bark and no bite. - What, what are they? - You really don't know? They're vampires. They're what's been destroying the city, at least the main cause. Many people have been killed by them. A few taken into their ranks. Most have left the city, though, going to someplace safe. And a crazy few like myself have foolishly tried to stay on. - Why? - Why? How can you ask that? Should I abandon my home, my life? Let something chase me away? I was born here. I plan to die here, even if it's sooner than God and I intended. You know, we tried to fight them once, a bunch of us who had accepted the truth and knew what was really going on. Not the supernatural, you know, not vampires, but the fact that something was out there trying to kill us off. We weren't getting any help from the police. We had to take care of ourselves. We got together and tried to fight, but we were unorganized and plenty scared. We quarreled among ourselves, and we only knew how to fight them on our own terms. We were using guns and knives. Anyway, we set up patrols to watch the homes at night, protecting the people, but it wasn't no use, man. We were at a disadvantage in the darkness, and they used it to their every means against us. Whole patrols of seven, 10 people would completely disappear without a trace. Just a few drops of blood and some torn clothing would be left. Many quit and got out of the city. A few stayed on though. We kept fighting right until the end. And now I'm the only one left. I kept fighting them for a while until the night I had to stake one of my own brothers. Lost him in the patrol sometime past. That's when I first accepted the truth that we were battling vampires. I had to stake him to get away alive. He almost had me that night. Seeing my brother like that took away my strength. I nearly collapsed on the street and gave up, but I fought my way back here. And since then, I've never gone back out into the streets at night again. We used to use guns on them, explosives, you name it. We were set to fight a war, only we were fighting it the wrong way. We really didn't know what we were up against until it was too late, until the damage was done. And each night another chunk of the city falls. Soon they will be in the suburbs, the countryside. The city already lost. And the people there will fail like we did because they won't believe either. This is my prized possession. (dramatic music) Someday though, man, I'm gonna find the leader. And when I do, I'm gonna stick this right in what he calls his heart. Those help me figure out what I'm up against. There's a library on the third floor above me. I got 'em there. Fiction or nonfiction, either can be just as helpful. You can sleep there tonight. - No, I can't stay. - [Mathison] Well, you certainly can't go out there. - I have to. - I now who you are, Sam Helling, and I know why you're here. I've been keeping track of things. I'm sorry. - It was just a wrong turn. I got off on the wrong exit, and I couldn't figure out how to get back on. So I stopped the car, tried to figure out where we were. I remember she said something to me. I didn't hear what. Then she was gone. I ran after her. - Sam! - [Sam] I could hear her calling, calling my name. (Christine screaming) She screamed. (Christine screaming) A ways down, I found something. It was dark out. I couldn't see, I couldn't make out details. But it had her. - Sam! - And then it turned on me. (vampire hisses) I did what came to me first, something I have and I always will regret. I turned and I ran. I remember hearing Christine scream one last time, muffled. Then she was silent. It was the last thing I ever heard from her, and it wasn't enough to keep me from running away. The cops couldn't find anything. They formed patrols. For days they searched, but they were disappearing too. Officers were turning up missing. They never claimed this though. Said it was lack of funds, no manpower, no leads. They never said the truth. It doesn't matter now. It was more than I had done. - Hey, man, you can't be killing yourself over that night. No one knows what you saw, and they could never understand your actions unless they saw it too. But if you keep up this search, you'll end up dead like the rest. I ran too, and I never saw a creature like you saw. (somber music) - All my life I've run away, even as a child. I'd tell myself it was for the best, that I was doing the right thing. Why get involved? I was a coward. I just never knew how low I had sunk until that night. I never knew I could give up so much so easily. Christine. Christine, she was my only hope. She's dead, and I don't have anything else. I'll be dead too. But I have to be certain. As long as there's a chance, any chance no matter how small, I can't give up. - You'll never survive out there. Then if you must go, at least you should have a fighting chance. - No, I never really believed in that stuff anyway. I'm not even so sure I believe in all this vampire stuff either, despite everything. - You better believe and believe now. The vampires' strength comes from our disbelief in them. They use that against us. If you're going to have any chance, any chance at all, you've got to accept them for what they are. That will work. It's the only way you're going to survive out there. Just don't forget it's there. I'll ask you again to give this up. Stay here for the night. - I can't stay. Besides, I think I might have a plan. - Then good luck. Be careful, you might not like what you find. - Hey. (knocking) (dramatic music) (vampire hisses) - Hello, lover, did you like the taste of my blood? (eerie music) (pounding) - Welcome, Mr. Helling, we've been expecting you. You've been quite a little bother. Martin was one of my best soldiers. - Let me take him now. - You'll have him soon, my darling. We all will. - Who are you? - I am Legion. (dramatic music) (blows cracking) I see you're still running, Mr. Helling. I know why you're here, Mr. Helling. You want your girlfriend back. - Where is she? If she's dead... - Oh, she's dead, Mr. Helling. Dead to you. While you were running away crying that night, we took her, all of us, and now she just exists as a small part of the whole. - No. No. - [Christine] Sam. - Please. Come on. - Go to him, my dear. You shall be given the feast. - Come on. Come on. - As I said, dead to you. - No! - When I saw her that night in your vehicle, I fell in love with her beauty, the innocence I saw in her face, and I had to have her. So I called to her, and she came. I made her one of us, we all did. And for this past month, I have enjoyed her beauty, have looked at her with love, and she's come to love me as her master and as her only lover. She is dead to you, Mr. Helling, and you are dead to her. Take him. And when you're done with him, not even the Devil will have his soul. (mournful music) - I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I failed you. I'm sorry. - Take him now! - You were never blamed. - No! (dramatic music) - Ah, I can't believe you betrayed me! How could you after all that has happened? I loved you. I will tear him apart before your eyes. In time, you'll forget he even existed. (eerie music) (dramatic music) Get them. Bring her to me. (vampire screeching) - Sam. You better not hold me too long, Sam. I don't know if I can always stop myself. Besides, we have to keep moving. - Wait, we'll get to the truck, and then we can get out of this place once and for all. We can go home, all the way back home. - I can't. - Sure you can. We can, we just have to... - Sam, I'm a vampire, and I always will be. - There must be a way. To break a vampire's hold, you have to kill the head vampire. So I'll kill that thing, that Legion. - That alone wouldn't be easy, probably impossible. But that wouldn't do it anyway. You see, when someone becomes a vampire, they're allowed to die first so as to exist beyond the chain. But with me, Legion did it different. I wasn't allowed to die. But I could return to the living, and he knew that. So he had them all suck my blood over several days, I guess. I wasn't awake for it. You see, vampires can sense each other, especially their creator. They can feel their master's pain and pleasure. And since Legion is our ultimate master, the beginning of our chain, we can all sense him. Legion wanted me so interwoven that he could never lose me. They can always sense where I am. They'll find me no matter where I hide, even now. Even now, they're closing in because of this. (vampire screeching) I can only return with their destruction. - Well, we'll run. We'll run so far away they won't bother to follow. - They'll never let me go. Legion will follow me to the ends of the Earth to get me back. I'll help you escape the city, but then I must return. Forget it, there's nothing you can do. And here isn't much time, we have to keep moving. - No, I have an idea and a friend who might have a plan. We have to go to her. - No, there isn't enough time. - Christine, trust me. I know I've let you down before, but I promise, I swear, I'm not gonna fail you again. - Okay, but you must go alone. - No! - Yes, they can sense me. And if you're with me, they'll find you too. They'll be looking for me, and it'll give you more time. - No, I'm not gonna leave you again. - You must. If you want to save me, it's the only way. So go. I'll hide here. I'll be able to dodge them. Besides, they won't hurt me. Legion wants me back. So go, now. Hurry, Sam, there isn't much time. - You want to end this once and for all? (upbeat music) - We need that and that. (ominous music) - Does this stuff really work? - Yeah, I've had to use it before. It'll melt 'em just like in the movies. The Market Square Mall. You mean they have their lair in there? Go around to the east side. I'll have the door unlocked. - Better be ready, I'll be coming fast. Hey, good luck. (ominous music) (dramatic music) (flesh squishing) (vampire shouting) - I told you this stuff really works. Hurry, man, you know where you are. (ominous music) - Where are you, you son of a... - You're very foolish to return, Mr. Helling. Very foolish. Hiding Christine will not save her. It's just a matter of time before my soldiers find her. Fight me in my own lair? That is quite bold. Back for death. (dramatic music) Garlic, Mr. Helling? I can still smell your blood despite it. I smell your fear, it gives you away. (Legion shouts) - [Sam] How about now? (dramatic music) (Legion laughing) (dramatic music) - There, now you look more like me. (ominous music) We can't have any more of that. You fool, you should've never come back. Now you're as good as dead. Do you hear me, dead. But you were already dead the night that I saw you. You were so pitiful the way you ran. Coward! (blow thudding) Coward. (blow thudding) And now both you and Christine are mine. (blow thudding) (Legion moans) - [Christine] Sam! (flesh squishing) Sam! (flesh squishing) (Legion shouting) - Now it ends. - [Christine] Sam! - Kill her! Tear her apart! (flesh squishing) (Legion shouting) (bell tolling) (dramatic music) - Christine! (water spraying) - Don't wait for me, get her out of here. Go! (water spraying) (vampire screeching) (vampire screeching) (water spraying) (dramatic music) (water spraying) Oh shit! Come on, you bastard! (dramatic music) (vampire screeching) - Well, here it goes. (bright hopeful music) (ominous music) (helicopter rumbling) - [Florence] Yesterday, we asked what is happening to the city of Braddock? But maybe the question should have been what is happening to cities throughout the United States? The exodus from Braddock is not unique, Other cities are reporting large drops in their population in just the past year. In New York, Syracuse recorded a 15% drop of 12,000 residents. Rochester lost... (dramatic music)
