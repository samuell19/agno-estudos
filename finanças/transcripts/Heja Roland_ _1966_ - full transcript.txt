Hard to sleep again. Call the gas company / Hanna When you have brushed your teeth - Call Svensson SIT DOWN AND WRITE - Bless you. - Thanks. They have turned it off. That's typical... exactly today! I have so much to do. You know what I'd do? Call about the gas meter, then go to the Telecom authorities. After that, I would... - Can we still receive calls? - For a couple more days. I'll just go up to the gas company today. That's what I have to do... I actually have to get up... to the gas company. I have to do it, huh? I go up to the gas company, so we get that settled... so that's done. - Hanna, I will arrange it today. - Will you buy milk? - Yes, after the gas company. - A long roll too. - Can't you let the little Pax be? - I save the doormat. He eats it. Do you know what you are? A real animal torturer. Have a nice meal. Dog bastard! - Hey, Roland. Where are you going? - To the gas company. Hanna can't sleep at night due to the gas meter... an old German model. Sture publishes a new novel today. A lot of people there. Are you coming? - I think I have to go to the gas company. - Follow up, please. - What should I do with the bike? - Give it away. Rolle, damn it! Are you here?! Hello. - Have you read the reviews? - I read the back. Congratulations. - Excuse me, what did you say? - CONGRATULATIONS! - How are things with you? You tinker with yours? So you are reading your own books? - I was just checking a detail. When will you release under your own name? I still belong to the non-talented. This is nothing to strive for. This commercial hell. Hi. Why do you let him write your novels? You've grown up on the same yard. You've had the same girls, the same things together. Why do you let him alone write about those things... forge them? Some bastard picks me apart at night and puts me together incorrectly. It takes all day to get used to. No time left for any novels. When it feels so, then it's as good to write other people's autobiographies. Don't you want to try again? To lie with me. I haven't thought about that the entire the last 15 minutes. Why not? - Does it have to be pink lighting? - No. - I'll drive you home. - No, not in that state. - I insist. - No, but you... No, no. I insist! Britt, we can't stand here. We can't do this. Or could we...? What are you doing? She can't have fainted? She's sleeping. What should I do...? Sleep tight. - Hello. - Hello. - Nice of you to remember the milk. - The milk? Yes of course. - Fine skirts! - Yes, but who will buy them? I shouldn't be doing this. - It was a long time ago I gave blood. - No, not that. They might inject incorrectly. - They don't. - You don't go there anyway. - I'm in charge of my blood. - Our blood - one flesh, says the priest. But we were never at the priest. The mayor didn't talk about meat. - Here are a lot of empty bottles. - Count them! - How many were there? - Four... - What do they pay for the blood? 28 SEK and a glass of juice. - A glass of juice too?! What kind? - It is optional. They didn't inject incorrectly. What are you doing? Hanna! You are bothered by the gas meter at night. What is that? The gas refrigerator is on! If I keep food cold in another way, what can we shut down? The refrigerator! What will stop it to make noise at night? Precisely - the gas meter! Yes, now that problem was solved. Need some rolls flushed? Don't make them too thick in the middle. Strange that Svensson hasn't called. Seems like he doesn't have a job for me. - Have you called Svensson? - No, that... - Time for Christmas tree lights again. - I'll call Svensson. I'll have a sandwich first. No! - Which number would you like? - You have no secretary, Svensson. Excellent lady imitation, but the base cuts through. You've drunk too often. - Isn't it Svensson? - No. Which number do you want? - 11 29 33 - The unit is taken down. - Do you mean turned off? - No, taken down. Taken down. - Oh really...? - There is no other number, then? - No. Did you see the foot? That was Svensson! Hello. - Don't you know me? - No, sorry... Potatoes peeler Charles de Luxe. - I didn't recognize you in that. - And I didn't recognize you like that. I called you... at the company. Couldn't you handle the phone bill? That playhouse! Boy, we didn't know what advertising was! - Have you got yourself better informed? - All-round, I work there now. - What have you started with? - I work in the bicycle shop. I always have, from time to time. It gives me a sense of reality. - A...? - A SENSE OF REALITY! Oh really. I've actually thought about you too. - And I've called you. - Oh really. Call again. Sure, I'll make a note. You could be selling your own grandmother for a Svensson slogan. Who wrote them? - Ida, the auto hair dresser? - The self curler. Ida was your baby. - What did you think it was? - Your baby. We say that about the projects. - I'll see what I can do for you. - Put the book down. - And get me a job. - Yes, of course. Bye. Hey, Roland. It is Svensson. I promised to contact you. Dammit, now Vassén is at the door! Please call in five minutes. Yes. What do I do now? - Can I call you in exactly two minutes? - In two minutes! - Welcome to the scent. - The scent? A playful name for our department that deals with perfumes and soaps. Things that scent... the scent! I have heard only the best about you. - You might especially think about Ida? - Ida? The self hair dresser: "Fix your festive hairstyle yourself for 6:75." You may have heard about the washing-scraper? Sink-scraper? - Steel-Olle. - Steel-Olle? "More beautiful sink... in shorter time..." I thought Svensson showed you my portfolio... ...I... we worked together with the Svensson slogans. I know nothing about that. Svensson slogans? - Maybe we should go back to... - Where should I start? - About what have you informed him? - The sin, adventure, sophistication. Please have a seat in the armchair. It has been at a club in Mayfair. Scent advertising is an adventure, dare I say after half a life with scents. - Here's Skog, the little helper. - Good day. Roland Jung. Hope to see you more times. - It came to life. - Look out! ÖJ- the bastard! - What do I call him if we meet? - Don't worry, you won't. "Summer", "Number 5" and "Spring". Go home and do your best now. Be calm... You'll get a true Svensson slogan! We didn't know what advertising was. - Now the light. - The gas company! - They said they would come. - No, they won't. Get candles. Cheers! So this is it. Not more left, when I had paid all the bills. It's very nice. But hey, some bread? - You, Roland! - Yes? - You are really cute. - What? I'm so silly, but I thought you'd forgotten my birthday. You had hidden them well, but I found them still...! - Hanna, you've forgotten the salt. - It's there. I can't see the pepper. Honey, there's the bottle. You see nothing. - I want to have "four spices". - Do you have "four spices"? - What are you doing? - Nothing... I only stand here. That was not so good, huh... - French whore - and not just a little. - It was you who said it. - If one goes there... - IF! "Do you want to make an extra buck, pour Avenue over your head before you go out." Imagine if I did advertising for perfume! Too eager! Don't trample into the boudoir with boots on! - You wanted an atmosphere of sin. - Yes, but in all decency. This text argues for the street's sin. That does not concern us. At least not during working hours. What are you doing?! Do you have stomach pains? In this case, we have an excellent laxer- agent with mint flavor. Very effective! Is it the heart? At your age. It that possible? It's the nerves! Do you know anything about muscle control? No, not much. - It shows in your face! - Does it show there? All human dignity begins with muscle control. Learning to economize with the muscles gives time for more important things...? - Approximately, yes. - I have often... searched for a content... But the body has always stood in the way. I thought it was because I smoke too much. You have done a bad perfume text. Look at that! A bad text, I said. You were disappointed. And the result? An earthquake in your face. It was an experiment, Jung. The text is not so bad! With minor adjustments, it's usable. Your facial expressions are worse... He thinks only of muscle control. He's crazy! Don't excite yourself, it gets so unpleasant... The smell! You haven't returned paper again. The corpse smell test might go to hell! - What the hell... it's confidential? - Can you go out for a while, Roland. - Roland! You must be Roland Jung. - Yes of course. We have called you and been to your home. Where have you been? - I have been sitting here in the house. - Where the hell have they hidden you? - I have written a text to Vassén. - That's a Malay-job. Come meet ÖJ! You'll hear some background. Our client will make a cream for pimples. The working title is "Corpse smell". Bloody chemist humor. We have launched a test. The kid has a helmet that shows what he reads. In the helmet sits television camera 1. Shooting the pupil movement. Television camera 2, photographing the newspaper. Here the images meet on the screen. If you follow the beam, you will learn a lot about him. You will meet 25 young people, a cross section of Sweden's 3/4 million teenagers. They are hostages. We won't release them until they told their secrets. You've been lucky. Vassén leads our trench war. Here we deal with hydrogen. I saw your work samples. Thank Ida for sitting here. - Ida? - You've found out your task? I'll meet 25 teenagers and talk about how "Corpse smell" is best for pimples. Not at all. We will not make you a sales clerk. We know that they will buy the cream. You'll find out why. Where has the question "Are you protected under your arms?" most impact? Of course, on a poster in a bus full of people on their way home after work. Young people have always had their own language, the flower language, finger-language... Then came the greasers. A fox tail on the car meant that there was room for the girls. When we finally come to grips with the car-driving, something different emerges: Boys with long hair... boys and girls who look alike. Why do they do it? They worry me. They are not afraid of anything. These are the large teenage cohorts. 15 years ago more than 100,000 children were born. These young people with their weekly wages are the real capitalists. It will be the same next year and the next - and the next. For us, that's a consumer group of enormous dimensions. But suppose they would turn off the market they represent, from our influence. It is not pessimism, it is happening. They don't want to acknowledge their youth, their tangled complexes. They refuse to acknowledge their growing pains. What is a youth without a search? You have to help me give their youth back to them. But first we have to scare them. Find out what they fear. Then we give them protective amulets. - What are you doing? - Home scent. - What did you do to my room? - Is there something wrong with the decor? A typical modsrum. Idols are selected by Pop-Journal's editor. When sunarna come, we will simply replace the idols. Here, young people can feel at home. Once we got them to talk, we have taken certain measures. And here... in the little flower. Wireless. And in the little lamp. How about that? Now go into the room next door, Jung. Jung! Can you bring the papers? - There's a fool in my room. - Vassén? ÖJ didn't say he would be in on the corpse smell. No, but I said. Where are you, Jung? Could you stay down there. - Wait, do you have questions there? - Yes. Wait downstairs. I didn't think he would be with us. - Are not you here? - Are you there now, Jung? - Please get out there, I'll come up. - Where should I exit... here? - Could you stay up there. I'm coming. - Are you down there now? - Get out of the elevator! - Should I go out... Where? Exit the elevator where ever you are. - Jung! Are you up there now? - I'm coming down now. - Would you stay where you are! - I'm in the elevator now. Should I go out? - You should have the questions now. - It's impossible. We'll stay. Would you go out of the elevator, Jung, so... The floors are numbered. - We take the 15th floor. 14th! - 14? Now I'm on my way up to 15th. Do you go further up than to 15? - Now I'm on the way up again. - Should I put the questions here? - Would you put them on 15. - They are newly stenciled. It is on the 15th floor, this. There they are, yes. Thank you! THANK YOU! - Who is number two on the pop play list? - Second? Second place is Hep Stars. - Then we'll take them. - I can't sew, if you... There you go! - Mac Coys are six! - Spell, spell. M-a-c C-o-y-s. - What? - I didn't say anything. Lean forward... He should have a little kink in the back too. Look here, Jung! - What do you say about it? - No. It is serious, not pop. This one? Can you lift the foot a little... No, it's not good. Not that outfit to that wig. Isn't that Beatles...? Then we take my biggest hope. - That's not bad? - It's good. Now we have to hurry. The mods girl is here in five minutes. The jacket is completed. The wig is perfect! Master your nerves, Jung. Think of muscle control! - You, the behind. - The behind? Kick. We forgot this! There you go. And the curls in order. Don't feel abandoned. We are on the other side of the mirror. - Welcome. - Thanks. Did you get hurt? - No, the back is only broken on 3 spots. - Have to be careful with those shawls. Shall I help you? Perhaps I should offer some music, but... - It does not matter. It's out. - Are the Kinks out? Not Kinks, but the Beatles. - Have a seat. - Thanks. - Can I... offer a refreshment? A whiskey sour for me. Do not know what it is? Yeah, but... I'm sorry, but we have probably only these varieties to choose from. Actually, I'm sorry, I would have needed one myself. We must content ourselves with this "little kids stuff". That doesn't matter. - You don't mind me lacing? - Lace? - You're not a teetotaler, right? - Do I look like that? - No, you look quite forward. - You think so? - What do you have in the bottle? - Just plain gin. This is for the visitations sake, to get it into the examination room. I can't count unless I get a shot. I'm bad at math. You haven't received anything. Thanks. - Cheers. Katharina is my name. - Roland is my name. - This was fun! I'm called Katti. - Rolle, then. Or... well yes, Rolle. What is this about? I tried that cream. It wasn't shabby. - Aren't you warm in that? - Warm? With this...? That was better. This was fun! It gets worse and worse. - That's enough for today. - We should have used an older force. Yes, that was the end of the questions. If you tire of the Soton, get in touch! It is a fairly typical reaction when they see a long-haired guy. They immediately start questions about pacifism. I wasn't allowed to join baseball games. They called me "babe". I ran to my father and asked him to cut me. Then I got to join. This priest, and the ceremony, I think this is pretty ridiculous. - You think it's false, or...? - Yes, exactly. It doesn't get better by standing and promising him. You can promise each other in private. They can't accept that it shows up a new... ...that the new generation has different ideals, and doing it "as it comes". They say go to work every day. Don't even celebrate sometimes. - The older generation, then? - It's not quite crazy, but... What do you think is wrong? To get up at seven o'clock, work until five. Home and get a beer, then extra work. "Fun", yes... You can replace it with another word. So then. Ferment - feel comfortable, relax properly... ...enjoy your life properly. - When you ferment, what do you do? - Lie down listening to music. It should be voluntary, in a sense. When you do not like firearms and war, then why be forced into it? He was a smash guy in his field. - Thunder Dude? - He was big, that is. Big. - Large - can you define it? - He had power over Germany. He forced his fellow men to do things they might not want to do. The future... What happens, happens. Then we have to try to do something about it. - How are you? - Oh, yes... - Britt? - She's fine. Hanna? Yes, it's good. - New novel again? NEW NOVEL AGAIN? - Yes, yes. It went well last time. It is the third this year, huh? - Yes. - You keep the pace. - So how are you doing? - It's a damn toil. - Did I understand the question correctly? - It says so. - How could you do this stuff? - What do you mean? - I have read some of your writings. - It was a long time ago. Yes, I was 15 then. It was you who taught me what exploitation means. You can't access me with your questions. What are you looking for anyway? - Why do you wear that? - Is it not worn nowadays? Yes, but not indoors. Isn't it hot? Don't you think they put deodorant in the head? Now that's enough. I hate amateur theater! Your booklet is stale, expired. The role is rewritten. For how much? If I want you on my side. How much do you cost? Shouldn't you quit? One question remains. It is scratched. - I see it's not scratched. - Now it's scratched. The tape recorder, then? I would like to tell your employer a few words. Make sure you speak Swedish, so the monkeys understand what you say. - You're bleeding. - Do I? - Wipe up with this. Wrong cheek - the other. You have torn a hole in a pimple. Had you used Preposept, you wouldn't have any pimples to tear open. With voodoo we excite your pimples to bloodshed, but we hurt only to heal. - You can pick up a new can at the exit. - Excuse me. Do you have a cleaning lady there? Our friend will probably feel bad. Do you have a cleaning lady there? Our friend will probably feel bad. What was the last question? If the Crown Prince used Preposept, would it influence your choice? Thanks for scratching that one. What a treat for the friends of the Republic. When he finished vomiting, he went home and studied the new arguments. He didn't take long. The next day he arrived with the first. He claims his chemical analysis proved that "Corpse smell" is worthless. Which proves he isn't as good at chemistry as he is at civics. - Does it? - What do you mean? Was he correct? Certainly. The cream consists mainly of petroleum jelly. Plus some neutral ingredients. Didn't I say that? Let us be clear about this! Preposept was a diversion to get a generation's answer to a question. If the answer was yes as to if the cream has been effective, they have called for help. I think I've got the answer. Preposept was only a beginning. It's our power to experiment with the human ages. We can extend the dramatic period of her life. Do they pay you based on merit? The other day I made a poster. Four words. It took me 20 minutes. I got more money than my father earned in a week. What was he selling? He had nothing to sell. I understand. My own father... Now it's the children's turn, Jung. We must take good care of them. Do you think they would be happy on their own? Yes, there we have little Pax. You look like a big rat, standing and barking. Bark, Pax. - You! Silence the dog! - It's not mine. Do something, I'll get you a box of bananas tomorrow. - I don't like bananas. - Bananas are high in carbohydrates. I don't like carbohydrates. You won't make me eat carbohydrates! Not even with unlimited advertising! Not even if I make it myself. But I won't. I'm not going to die with a slogan in the mouth. I had foreseen this, Jung. It is part of the play. Must prepare for this when dealing with people. - It is easier with horses. - Are you interested in horses? Then you know that a trotter sooner or later begins to gallop. - Dressage can never be perfect. - Such a shame. Sometimes it is an advantage to lose. That gives advantage next time. - Or you could of course whip them. - I don't allow the boys to do that. But you can give them better feed. You can't lure me with better feed. I know I'm not a good advertisement for my product. What can I expect from life? A better kind of biscuits? Now you want to retire to your conscience's hermitage. You want to bring everything you have done here. You count the test material as yours. I'll let you buy back your work. Fix a price. - Are you kidding...? - Put a price on your conscience. Put it high, for sport's sake. What do I know? You might have private capital. I have 35 SEK, my parents are dead and my wife is a crafter. - You could borrow at the bank. - People like me can't borrow money. But all right, you started. You must stand your roll. 1000 SEK? You could have a wealthy friend. I quintuple the sum. Do you play the lottery? I prefer not to trust you. You can have a lot of traction in the morning. Tomorrow at noon the deadline runs out. The keys, Jung. Do you take me for an amateur? Good luck! This makes me survive the night. 10 SEK for number eight to win. A treasurer at the horse races... - Jung! - You bet the boss horse, I see. - I can become rich - me too. ÖJ doesn't make money on horses. They aren't scared of smelling badly. Hello! The eighth race was won by horse number 2. Second horse was number 10... I've heard that "Grönex II" will win this race. Well, I'll remember it. - Will it not, then? - I can't believe that. - I happen to know the owner. - I know the driver. It was true, I met Harold. He asked for you. He seems loaded. Loaded, you said? - Will it win? - Write it up! Can you afford to bet that much? On the wrong horse. I have the name of the winner. Though I have nothing to invest. How about an advance? How could I deny you that? How much do you need? A couple of hundred. Come join, you too. I have the winner! Yes, Skog... It's thirty times the money. She is shod finely, huh? How did you get into this, Skog? Have your trousers ever got stuck in a bike chain? Then you know. Just follow it around... - How did you do when it was auditing? Piece of cake. I of course had to acquire another pair of pants. Two books! When the auditors came in, then? Then I had to change pants. It will go nicely! It must go. Nicely away! - Oh, no. She jumped out of it. - Don't worry, Skog! It doesn't look good... I think she goes fine. This does not look good... - She will never get out. - She goes nice, right? - She'll be trapped. - No, it's okay, Skog... - She will not come out! - No, no, it's okay, Skog. It will go the way. Do you see what I see now, Skog! There she goes! Like a rocket! Look! We won! We can afford a new hat, Skog! I took the liberty to order lunch for you, Jung. This is my own little joy. Sandwich with honey... boiled fish... For dessert, cooked apples, a dream of a Borgia. - The bread looks delicious out. - Not true? They are just one day old. - You know that you lost the bet? - Would you let me taste a piece. I take from the edge here. So, a little can't hurt, huh? We all have something that prevents us from being truly free. You have your four words that weigh up to your dad's work week. I also had a father. He sold tomatoes, carrots and lettuce heads. Maybe we grew up in the same neighborhood. We might have met there. Did you collect the cards in caramel packages? Footballers and aircraft. I collected the aircraft. A series consisted of 150 cards. Each caramel cost 5 cents. I missed the 150th that would make the series complete. It was a Fokker. A schoolmate had it. I wanted to buy it from him. He set his price, 5 cent. I accepted. He got his dime and I got my Fokker. But then I got beat up by my father because it was a bad deal. I had not had a caramel for my 5 cent... But it was a good deal! I might have had to buy 500 caramels before I got my Fokker. But my father beat me up. In the basement his tomatoes were lying, rotting. Were you also a caramel consumer? Perhaps you had my card. Too bad we never met. We could have done business. I had obviously tried to lure you back then. You know that I'm going to fool you now? I will not hand you the bands and papers. You have the money, I have seen it all along. But the clock is past 12. - I was here long before 12. - Prove it. Did someone see you? ÖJ! What the hell do you mean?! - You have... - ÖJ! You have... Help! Help! Jung has... Answer me! Yes, yes. - Don't you see? The man has fainted. - What about it? Close the window! ÖJ! What the hell happened? Thanks for the loan! Think of muscle control! The clock rings, right? You see, I didn't bolt the window in ÖJ's room. Now I can steal the papers and tapes. - Good luck. - Thanks, Jonsson. - Do you have a match? - What? No no! - Get out! - No, why? I'm standing right here. - What are you doing up there? - I have my work place up here. I forgot my pipe in the room. I must have a few puffs before I fall asleep. - I'll get the porter. - No, don't! He has lumbago. - Back lumbago! - It is surely some advertising antics! That's it! Advertising! Advertising for powder... for the scent. Carry the fragrance in your pocket. Here you have tubes of various sizes - for 4:75! - What do they cost? - They costs 4:50. But you'll get this. You powder your smell under the arms. We all perspire more or less. - And we sell them very cheaply. - He's out of his mind! - What is the brand, then? - It's... I have actually forgotten. Strange that one forgets a brand with a wonderful aroma. They cost no more than 4:50... Imagine! Hello. No... oh! It's a long story. Next time you can't undress yourself, we will do it together. What about the brooch? The one you had in your hand when you slept... pretty sweet. To not remove the lipstick... - It's not what you think. - It must have been the dealer. - The dealer? No... not the dealer himself, but when it happened, eh... ...you see... I was thrown out. And that was because I hitchhiked up the food elevator. But, by then Skog and I had already won on the horse... before, that is! So, the treasurer! That was before the façade climb... then I had the... No, then the taxi driver who shadowed me, he had... But then I had already been thrown out once before... and after that... I can't tell. It's too complicated! I think you're lying! We have decided to not tell everything we do. But don't you think that you've exaggerated in the other direction lately? You could have said it before we got married. You can't get married if you have syphilis. - I've never had syphilis. - I'm talking in pictures. Stupid picture. Syphilis can be cured. Your condition is worse. - What do you... want to get rid of me? - Roland, hear me now. I have one pair of shoes! Idealism is for people with entire soles. - You want me to go back there? - There or... somewhere else. It will be there, I know nothing else. It's so silly, it started with... It's not so bad not worse than... It felt as if I wasn't clean underneath. I know I'm an idiot! - You can't feel good today. - No, you can be calm. How's ÖJ? He seems to have eaten something inappropriate. - What the hell did you do? - We only talked about caramels. What happened here? Someone must have been careless with the window. ÖJ left the door open for you, hell knows why. - You'll relax with a perfume text. - All right. I had a meeting at my room, yes! Our friend the writer Good day! Do the men know each other? - Jung - Lennert. - We have even rode a scooter together. - Yeah. You got my letter? - When can I start? - We don't know yet... Hanna, what are you doing in those clothes? Asta Karlsson. We have not met. - We haven't? We can meet in the evening? - Shut up, you trailer-Casanova. - What are you doing in those clothes? - Go now, before you ruin everything. We take the small baskets and... empty them in the central bin. - What do you do with the central bin? - We take it to the cellar. Jung! What's going on over there? You understand that all fraternization with the maids is prohibited. We have so many dark scrubs and so many nervous young men. - Hello. - Hello. Why are you doing this poppycock? Do you think it's funny? Where have you been? I sit here, having a cold. - Hollywood. - Have you been to Hollywood? - What did Frank Sinatra say? - Hollywood at Götgatan. Only two rooms. - What the hell are you doing? - Cleaning. Go wash up! You stink like a whole boudoir. Asta Karlsson...! How did you do it? Not hard. They didn't ask for grades. But then you almost destroyed everything. An idiot scolded me about the windows. I got the key to clean up there. I hope it is right. Why did you do it? You said you needed it clean underneath... - How's your novel going? - Which fucking novel? That thing you occupy your time with. Do something with all of your ideas. At least one. In all cases, no novel. Sture Lennert write them for me. The small novels. I can't do the bigger ones anyway. You know what a novel is nowadays? - Toilet flowers. - Toilet flowers? Remember the ballet girl on tour got gladiolus on stage...? Nowhere to put them. Imagine, when she gets up in the hotel room... The same goes with the welfare state novel. Takes too much space, nowhere to put them. But I'll gladly call the gas company. Hell, we've got 5000 SEK to repair for! And I'll call in sick to the Health Insurance Fund... - Do you have the papers here? - What papers? - From the gas company. We replace a meter. - To the right. - I'm dangerously sick. - Good day, it's the janitor... We'll make a new and better test, with a professional judge of character. - You certainly guess who. Sture Lennert! - Who did you say? Was that your wife? Strange, I have seen her at the office? You can't have seen her. She is rarely outside. She's allergic to snowflakes, everything white. The old hag enters? Mortell! I live here! What's up, Mortell? Go home now, or you will become a pile of snot! - You can't think... - Mortell, stay out!
