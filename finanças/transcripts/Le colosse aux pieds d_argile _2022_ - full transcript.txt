This film is fiction loosely based on a true story. Seb? THE COLOSSUS WITH FEET OF CLAY 30 YEARS EARLIER... Seb! - Catch! Keep moving! I hate when you're being dishonest like this. - I'm dishonest? Who's on duty every week? - But we're understaffed. - Hey, understaffing's a great excuse now, isn't it! - We won't miss the beginning of the match. - But if you weren't like snails as well— - Shit. - What's the matter? - They're arguing again. - Now we're really going to miss the start of the game. - Well—you're my best friend, but rugby's sacred. I'm off. - Dirty louse! I'm not giving you Nathalie's answers again! - Sure, that's fine! - How're you doing? Are you all right? Yeah? - Yeah, you? - What's going on? What's all that? - A fight. A fight? A fight— That needs settling right away. It'll be all right. See you later. Some of us have to be organized, because Monsieur always has problems with his agenda! You piss me off! I piss you off? - That's enough, Josy. I didn't see you. How are you? - I missed you. You smell good. You smell of magnolia. - Stop it! - And you're beautiful. More and more beautiful. - Stop it. - Hey Bernard. Have you noticed how beautiful your wife is? - Put me down, My God! - Look! She's not bad at all. - You're fucking stupid. What's going on, you two? What's up? - Nothing. Well—no, nothing. Business as usual. - Well, if it's business as usual, move on. And get straight to the party. Bernard, your son is watching you. You don't want to hurt him. - All right, I apologize. - I apologize too. - He's great. - Yeah, he's really great. - I'm very glad he's our rugby coach. - Can we go? - Yes. 30 YEARS LATER - Hey coach, we're giving them a real stuffing! ♪ I'll go from Pamplona to Bayonne ♪ ♪ I'll go from Dax to Mont de Marsan ♪ ♪ I'll make the greatest pilgrimage ♪ ♪ Of partygoers of all time ♪ ♪ I'll go from Pamplona to Bayonne ♪ ♪ I'll go from Dax to Mont de Marsan ♪ ♪ I'll make the greatest pilgrimage ♪ ♪ Of partygoers of all time ♪ - For Coach! - This victory's down to you, guys. You took the game from them and didn't let go until the last second. That's how you win titles. Bravo! - Either way, it's no thanks to Etchevarria. - Not my fault, it was his pass— - Wasn't his pass. You're a joker. - Guys guys, a little fair play! - Were you worried about your manicure? - Next year you should take up ice skating! - Hey guys, leave him alone. The little fag does his best! - What did you say? Go ahead, I dare you to repeat it! César! - I didn't say anything. - You didn't say anything. So you're a liar, too? Go on, apologise. Apologise right now. Apologise! - Sorry. It's okay, coach, it was just in fun. No, it wasn't in fun. - It's not fun because it's not funny. In here, I want respect. Violence and humiliation are banned. Otherwise, it's exclusion. Do we agree? - Yeah— - We're rugby players, for fuck's sake. Not animals! Here! All right. Get on with it by yourselves. Come on, ducklings! - Sébastien! Sébastien, hurry up. in the middle. - We're ready, boys, okay? - Yeah! - Off we trot, you rotten lot! Don't you want to dance too? - Bernard, get dancing! - Come on, Bernard! - Yeah Bernard! - Your mother's always laughing. - Sometimes I tell myself they married for love. - Whatever, it's obvious she really loves him. - Yeah, Bernard! - Come on Bernard, that's enough. - What? - Him too. It's just that— He gets down a lot. I think he wanted to be a rugby star. But—he just wasn't good enough. - I'd love to be a rugby star too. - What! You? - Yeah, me. - You're a girl. - So what? It's not really a girl's sport. You're all nothing but male chauvinists here. - Hey, stop looking at him like that, you'll wear him out. - Don't worry, I'm not made of sugar. - Yes I know. Good morning. - Good morning. Have we met before? Bernard's cousin? - That's right, my mother is his sister. Delighted, Dilou. - I know. - Do you dance? - No. - Of course you do, you must. - Not here. - Look at this dream body. You have to dance. - Do you know what I want to be later on? Helicopter pilot. - Really? - Yeah. - Would you like to go on a date with me? - A date with you? - Tomorrow, after the match in Mugron, I'll buy you an ice cream at the Feria. - Yeah, okay. There's nobody here! - It's your father. - Fuck it, definitely a bad day. What do you want? - Do you want a beer? No thanks. - You know, I sometimes go and watch your games with your kids. They're good. And that little left winger looks promising. - César? - He reminds me a bit of you. - He reminds you of me? - Angel face, always ready to use his studs— You were a bit like that. On the field, he plays dirty, and at school it looks like he doesn't give a shit. - Leave me alone, will you? - What did I say? - Don't pretend I need you, Dad. - What? - I don't need you. So take your beers back— and get out of here. It's not a good day. We'll chat another time. The gane doesn't matter. You'll win the next one. What does Grandma Crapette always say? - Everything comes to those who wait. Truth is, I don't really care about the game. It's just— I'm in a hurry to get there, that's all. - Yeah. You're desperate for a pee. - Yeah, that too, but— - Oh—you've got a date with a girl! That's good! That's great, kid! - Yeah. That's why I don't want us to be late. - Don't worry, we won't be late. We'll stop for a piss. With a little luck we might even see some wild animals. - Now? You know your dad told me you were really well hung. Shit, Tristan forgot his cap. - We'll give it back to him tomorrow. We'll stop over there. Go ahead, go and pee. Show me if what your Dad told me is true. - What? Come on, don't be shy. Let it go. Wait. Hey, now we both have a secret. All right? Come on. - Oh Bernard! - Well? - How are you? - Good, you? - How did it go? - Yes—great. No, he lost. - Really? - Yeah. - Oh well, come on in. Are you having a nap, Sébastien? Come on. Wait, do you know that joke? - Are you okay? - Your husband's dying, no big deal. - Are you okay? - Am I boring you? - If you don't mind, my husband's choking! Please wait. - Can I go on or not? So do you know how to get 40 Basques in a Deux-Chevaux? - 40 Basques? - Easy. You tell them the Landais did it. That's the joke! - A niche joke for sure. - I'm dying, I'm dying! - That's not possible. The joke was so good. - There you are, Loulou! Come on in. Feeling better? Dilou said you weren't feeling well. Do you feel any better? - Oh man! - The match turned his stomach. - To be honest, they were kicking a lot. - Really? - And the referee didn't blow for anything— Go ahead, champ, tell us what you saw. Come on, tell them. A boar. A boar. Oh dear— Yeah, beautiful. A boar's not so surprising. They're everywhere. - I didn't hear. What did you see? - He saw a boar. - Oh, great! - Boris saw one the other day too. - This will do you good. - Me? Hold on. - Yeah. Well—what's up with you? Are you afraid of me now? - No. - There there— You don't seem very well. A little under the weather maybe? Grandma— - Yes, what? - Does Dad— Does he say things about me? - Things about you? What things does he say? - It's because— - Sébastien. Comeon! The dogs can't wait for you all day. But— - Okay, you can finish off. I'm going to work. And do it properly, unlike last time when Bilou got nothing. I'm late. Dad? - What? Well—what? - I don't want to go to games with Dilou anymore. - You want to give up rugby? - No— - Well then, why don't you want to go to matches any more? - It's not that— - What is it then? - Tell me! This is unreal! You always have to tell me something when I'm trying to leave. Are you doing it on purpose? What did I tell you about rugby? - We finish what we start. - Right. And that applies to everything. So you're going to games. And don't let me hear that you're disobedient to Dilou. Because that might have consequences. - You still have just as much patience! What's that on your hand? - Nothing, I hurt myself. Sorry about yesterday. I hope you didn't wait too long? - Well, yes, a bit, of course. - One of our dogs ran off. We had to run after him with my Dad. You should have seen the mess— - Seriously, that's the best excuse you could come up with? - But it's true. Call me a liar, too! - I'm not calling you a liar. Your parents and mine were at the Feria together last night. - It happened afterwards. - If you say so— - What, you think I didn't want to see you? - Was it because of Emilie you didn't come? Is that it? - Who's she? - You know perfectly well who Emilie is. The other one, the ugly one. You even kissed her behind the church, Tristan told me. It's disgusting. Is it true? - Don't—don't touch me. - What's wrong with you? - Leave me alone. - You're useless! If you don't want to be with me just tell me! Well, you know what? That's fine, neither do I. Happy birthday, Seb! Happy birthday! How's it going? - Happy Birthday, cousin. Happy birthday. - How are you? - Well, we made you two cakes. Your favourites. We're watching you. Go ahead. Make a wish. Everyone! I have good news: there's no parents here. Do what you want. We see nothing, hear nothing. Let's go! Are you sure—sure you want to do it in there? - Don't you want to now? - Yes, I do, it's—it's not that. Tristan. Mate, that's it, I did it! What did you do? - What do you think? - Who with? - With Emilie. - You touched her breasts and everything? - More than that, I'm not a virgin any more! You want something to drink? - No, it's fine, thank you. - Dude—behind you. Oh well—Happy birthday. You managed to make me jealous. You even hurt me. Don't do this to me. You never do that to me again, right? Promise? You're beautiful. You don't know how beautiful you are. Are you cold? Come here. Come on guys! Stretch your arms! Carry on, guys. - See you up there? - You're not playing! - Why? - Thirty minutes late. Do you have an excuse? - No. - Right, so you sit down and watch the others. You respect the rules here, or you're out. You're not playing, I told you. - So you decide? - Yes, I decide. I'm the one with the whistle, okay? - You're a failure, actually. A failure. - Look at yourself. Wouldn't it be better to talk to me? - No. You have to let your anger out, Or else it'll eat you up inside. Trust me, dammit! - You're not even my father. To the left. I'm going to tell my Dad what you're doing to me. - You think he'll believe you? Since the time— Stop your nonsense. - I'm going to tell him anyway. - So because of you, the family's destroyed. Is that what you want? Your parents have enough problems. They don't need a gay son in the family. - I'm not gay. You know— Your parents know me. They trust me. What are you going to tell them? Anyway, if you talk to them about it, I'll tell them you're a poof. And they'll believe me. Get on with your life, move on. Have you seen how puffy his eyes are? He's changed, don't you think? - He's changing, he's 14 years old. Change is normal. - Yes of course. I was summoned by the head of his school. I was ashamed. - Why? What did he say to you? - He said Seb's not okay. He says he's not working. And he and his gang of friends are becoming real jerks. They even have a scapegoat. Do you realise? - If the other boy doesn't defend himself— If he lets himself go— Your son beats him up to mark his territory. - To mark his territory? Can you hear yourself? What do you think—he bows before the opposition on the pitch? - Fine, but excuse me, life isn't quite like a game of rugby. - What exactly do you think he wants? - To find that out, you might actually have to talk to your kid. - Mum! Please, it's okay. - His marks have gone down—so what? So he won't be going to university. Neither did we. This isn't that big a deal! - Well no, that's pretty clear. - We're manual workers in this family. All right, time to go. I'm off. Don't hold dinner for me. - Are you still on duty? - I'm not the one who decides. How many times have I asked you not to interfere? 10 times? 20 times? Dammit! Come on, what about a game of petits chevaux, just the two of us? - What's going on in that head of yours. - Grandma? - Yes? Not sleeping? - Yeah, I am. - You're still my baby, aren't you? I know you're a big boy now, but— I can see when things aren't right. You used to tell me everything. You'd come and see me and whisper in my ear what was troubling you. Would you like to try that again? - Have you been crying? - No way. I'm a little tired, that's all. What's going on? Is it your friends? Has something happened at school? - No. - So is it me and Dad fighting? - Mum— - Yes? - Are you getting a divorce? - No. We argue, that's normal for any couple, but— that's all. Okay? Is that what's bothering you? Not that? A girl? I don't know, Dilou told us you were in love. - You—you talk about me with Dilou? - Yes of course, it happens. He's worried about you too, you know. - But why— why do we have to see him? He's not the only one in our life. - What's got into you, Loulou? You told me you liked him. Are you upset with him? I hope not, because he's going to be part of the family soon, you know. - What? - It's a secret for now. He's going to marry Myriam. Merry Christmas kids! Who's been good this year? - Canapé? - Yes please! - Higher! Fingers to the sky. - Canapés, my friends? Straight from the oven. - There's a gift for Sébastien too. - Seb, look, I've got a present. - Can't you see he's a fake Santa Claus? - It's Christmas! - It's Christmas! You're my favourite. Here, a lovely present for you. Merry Christmas. - I don't want it. - What's wrong? - Well Loulou, are you being spoiled? Go on, open it. Come on, Seb, open it. You're crazy. - Sébastien, look at me. For heaven's sake smile! - Did you say thank you? - Come on. - Seb, smile for the picture please. Come on, smile. It's a very nice gift. - There! - You're so cute. - Hey, don't make that face. Just because I'm getting married doesn't mean we won't be friends any more, you and me, okay? Come on, enjoy your gift. César! What the hell are you doing here? César! Well here you are! What are you doing? I've been waiting to go trout fishing with you for an hour. - You decided to play the idiot, did you, louse? - That cap doesn't suit you. You've built a really great set-up here. Are you getting right into bodybuilding? - Well yeah. I can't stay a kid all my life. I have to find a solution. - Why don't you want to stay a kid all your life? - Is that what you want? I have a theory. In life, if you're strong, nobody will bother you. Want me to show you something? - Yeah. - Where'd you get that? - I bought it. Don't tell anyone, okay? - Wha— What's it for? - To defend myself. You never know. You all right? You never stop. - Don't worry, they've all had their ration, even Otsa. - No no, I'm not saying anything about that. I— do you think I'm putting too much pressure on you? I'm sorry for not being around much at the moment. But—your mother and I will always be here for you. You do know that? - Yes I know. - I don't want you to miss out on anything. And even after— Even if things get more complicated, even if we see less of each other— it'll always stay like that. Because you're my son and I love you. - Have you got cancer? - No, don't panic. It's just—I'm not very good at talking. - Why would— why would we see less of each other? - It's a manner of speaking. I thought about what you said about rugby, about wanting to stop. If you want to stop, you can. - What made you change your mind? - Mum and I, when we got married, I knew I'd never play at the Stade de France. Dreams are for kids. And then, I became an adult. And then, you came along. You made us happy. Well—that was enough for me. Until I saw you with a ball. That's when I knew that you— you'd walk on the hallowed turf. You have the talent. It was like—vindication for me, like hope. But it's not your dream. It's mine, so— you're right. You have the right to stop. Do you understand, son? And don't forget to close the kennel gate. - Dad? I won't give up, I promise. I'll fight to the end. Kalimotxo is strong. Come on. - Come on. What are you doing next year? - I have to get away from here. Or else it'll be sport. - Hi. Are you drunk? - No no. - All right, I'm out of here. - Wait, Tristan. Well—actually, I do have something to say. I came to say goodbye. - What? But—where are you going? - I'm going to a boarding school. After the holidays. You know, to get better marks. So I can get into pilot school later. So— Can you tell me what's bothering you? Seb, after that, it'll be too late. - There's nothing. I swear, nothing. There's nothing. - Okay. - Okay then, good luck for the future. Bye. Hey, where are you going? - I'm going to see Mum. I have something to tell her. - No, no. - I could see he didn't want to be here any longer. - We're here for you. - What's wrong with her? - Don't panic, it's not her, it's your father. He packed his stuff and left. So, your parents are separating, my poor little pussycat. The jerk met someone else. See you next Sunday, champ. And don't forget, you're not alone. Go on, have a good evening. - One day I'm going to kill you. Mum? - Oh, you're back. I'm going to—going to—clean all this up. - It'll be okay, I promise. - You're cute. Come on. Come on, let's forget about all that. You're the man of the house now. I don't want any more lies. Ever. No more lies. All right? Don't be like your father. Tell me everything? Promise me? - Don't worry about me, Mum. Hello kids! How're you doing? What? You're playing football? We're in rugby country here. We play rugby. - Oh, there you are, big boy! - All right? - My darling. I'm happy to see you. - I'm happy to see you too. What do you think of my pastis? - Fantastic. - You know it Mum. The best. - Flatterer! Will you be at Michel's bodega party this year? - No— - Yes, to the bodega with your thirst! - No, I haven't been there for years. I don't go there any more. I only went last year to help out. - That makes me think— I heard Tristan was at the Landes Feria. - Really? - Yes. I only found out by chance. He didn't say anything to you? - No, I didn't know he was coming. He didn't even call me, the jerk. - He didn't call you? - No. Besides, I haven't seen him for years. Tristan, fancy that. Anyway— What's up Mum? - Nothing. It isn't nothing. What's up Mum? I know you too well. What is it? - It's my back. It seems Dilou is a little depressed. Presumably because he can't sell his house. Have you heard anything about it? - Why are you talking to me about Dilou? - I don't know—Just that— he's part of the family. - Mum, why are you talking about Dilou? We haven't seen each other for years. Why are you talking about Dilou? - Do you two have a problem? - That's none of your business! - Quite so, quite so— You never told me why you— why you don't see him any more. Well done, now you've ruined everything. Happy? - Seb! Please, Sébastien— - Come on. - Why are you so angry? And you—stop smoking, I told you. The ball is still with France, but Wales are competing strongly. Sammy? - Yeah? - Stand me a drink? - Yeah, okay, Seb, I'll give you— - No, a double! - Yeah yeah, stay cool. - Hey! Don't you touch me! - I can't see— - Don't touch me! What are you looking at? - The game. - Not so loud! You're breaking our ears! - What's wrong? You have fragile ears? - Don't touch me, I said! - But I can't see! - You don't like my face? - I— - No fighting in the bar! - You! Shut your mouth! - Stop it now! - Calm down guys. He's losing a lot of blood. Give me an ampoule of Midazolam. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Farah? - Sir? Can you hear me? THE COLOSSUS WITH FEET OF CLAY You gonna tell me what you were doing in that bar? With these guys, to be in this state? Were you drunk? - Mum, I'm not 12 any more. - Then you should manage to get home on your own. Since you think you know so well how to do that. Do you think I want to see my son like this, at my age? Why don't you find a nice little wife? Instead of throwing tantrums. Instead of lashing out at everyone. - All right Mum, can I come in? Thank you. - You're getting on my nerves. One day, you won't wake up, Sébastien. And I won't wake up either. - Any news of Farah? - Who? Ah, the girl who wanted to be a helicopter pilot? I think she's in Paris. I see her parents from time to time in the village. Why? - Just asking. I thought I saw her. Farah. Don't make that face, you look like you've seen a ghost. - It almost feels like that. - Really? I thought you recognized me in the ambulance. - I thought I was dreaming. - You know what? I got airsick. Pretty stupid for someone who wants to fly a helicopter. - Yeah, you said it! Cheers. - So I became an emergency doctor. - Yeah— - Couldn't be more different. - Yeah, that's for sure, it's not even close. So you're back in Dax? - No, I'm in Paris. I just came here to visit my parents. And suddenly I'm helping out at the hospital. It's almost a happy coincidence. - No such thing as coincidence. - True enough. And besides, I wanted to see you. - Oh really? - yeah, the last time we spoke, how old were we? 13? - Yeah— - 14? How are you doing? - As you see. My nose isn't broken. I even coach a girls' rugby team. - And—have you spoken with Tristan? - Why Tristan? - Is that why you fought? - Because of what? What are you talking about? And anyway, why's everyone going on about Tristan? - Look, I just think it would be nice for you to talk to each other. I have to go. César. What were you doing on the bridge to make you run like a rabbit when you saw me? What's your problem? Why are you being such a jerk? - I'm not being a jerk. - Yes, you are. And you weren't like that before. So tell me, what happened? Stop, stop! - Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. Out! We're talking! So tell me— - Don't touch me! - I just want to talk to you. - I have nothing to say to you. - Okay. Hey—I'm here, just in case. I think I was like you when I was little. - You fuck off too.. Seb? - Fuck—Tristan— Oh fuck! - Go for it. - Do it. - It's been thirty years. Well—you're—damn, you're beautiful. You're beautiful. What happened here? - It's nothing, some evenings end badly. - Fuck, you're still— - Yeah. But we're old now, that's all over with. I heard you're in the army? - Yes, I'm a captain. - Captain. - Yes. I break the balls of 120 men all day long. - Captain Tristan. - I knew that— I knew you were going to call me. Really? - You know why, don't you? - What? - Well, listen, I'll be straight with you. Anyway— I've already talked. The hardest part is over. Dilou raped me when we were kids. - Dilou? - For years. I—I never really dared talk about it. Then the other day, I ran into him at the Landes Feria, with his wife and two grandchildren. Like some "Grandpa Dilou". The perfect grandfather, you know? - Yes. - Did you tell the cops? - No. No. There I— I went public, Seb. I spoke up in front of everyone. They all known in the village now. That's enough for me. Yes. Now I understand why everyone's talking about you just now. I caused quite a stir, that's for sure. But hey, listen, for me, it— It freed me. You see, I spilled my guts. And I regret not having done it before. - This is unbelievable. Fuck. - You knew nothing at all? - Fuck, no. - Yeah. A real piece of shit. For me, lying was a kind of— Lying had become second nature, in fact. And being ashamed too. - What did you do after college? - Failed studies, two divorces. - Do you have kids? - No. One third of these scum— were victims themselves when they were kids. So that calmed me down. What about you? - The same. I mean, I don't have kids either. - Yeah, I meant about Dilou? - What about Dilou? - I don't know, like we behaved the same when we were kids. I always wondered— - Me? No. No, no, fortunately. Because— - Good, okay, that's all right then. All right. Grandpa Dilou! - Come here. Yeah! Come on, shout for the ball, guys! That's it. Arms out! Come on, don't drop the ball. Come on, keep going! That's it, guys. That's good. FARAH Carry on, guys, you're doing well! Were you planning to call me or did you mix up my number? No, I was going to call you. Have you seen Tristan? No. Too much work. - Aren't you curious? - That must be it. Good, but apart from me, do you have anyone else to rescue? - No. - No? Can I invite you to dinner? I found out that I actually enjoy emergency situations Because all of a sudden, I have to act. And adrenaline, well I don't know, it's good adrenaline. I'm enthusiastic. - Good what? - Adrenaline. - Oh, adrenaline. - Are you okay? Seb, are you okay? You moron! It's not possible! You're an emergency doctor, and I might have been dying. - Don't worry, if I'd had to act, I'd have acted. - And— Do you have a boyfriend in Paris? - Depends which day it is. - "Depends which day it is." - What about you, do you have anyone? - No, I don't have anyone. No wife, No children. - Really? Don't you want all that? - I don't think I'm cut out for that. - I'm sure you'd make a good Dad. Really? What makes you say that? Let's just say—when we were little, I looked at you and I said to myself that— you'd make a great Dad. - Show me your hand. - What do you see? - This story is going to end well. I see you kissing someone tonight. I lied to you. - Me too— - He raped me too. In the Gascon woods. All the wild animals. On the way back from training. The red car—the ashtrays—his breath— his smoky breath. His hands on my body. His hands— Four years— Four—fucking years. I don't know how I survived. When he did those things to me— and when he told me to turn my back so he— I tried to run away, and then— I was 16. He called me, he told me— Come back. Come home. And he didn't—he didn't touch me. He told me—He told me I'd grown up. That it was over. And—he was no longer interested in me. - Well done. You did well to talk about it. You did well to tell me. César, what are you doing here? César. Did you hear me? What are you doing here? - Why did you say the other day you were like me? - May I sit here? I was raped when I was little. - That's impossible, you're a strong man. You too are a strong man. Who is it? A relative? César. César, you need to talk. I'm warning you, if you tell anyone, I'll kill myself and it'll be down to you. Okay. I won't say anything, I promise. But it has to stop. Do you understand, César? It has to stop. You have to talk. - What happened when you talked about it? - Me? I— - You're talking shit, aren't you. You're a fucking liar! - César. Guess who! Careful with your answer. - Emilie? - No. You left like a thief the other day. - I didn't want to wake you. - Hmm. Will you teach me to play one day? - it's not going to work, the two of us. - Why not? - I'm just not that kind of guy. - What kind? - A normal guy, a decent guy. I don't see myself with a family, surrounded by children. I'm not meant to be happy. - You say that because you're terrified. I understand. But there may be another reason. Don't look at me like that, as if you pity me, please. - Well, if that's what you think, that's because you don't understand anything about me. - So what do you expect from me? Tell me. - I don't know. Everything. - Everything— I can't offer you anything. I can't offer you anything because it won't work. I know that already. I'll hurt you, it'll end badly. - You're hurting me now. - Better now than too late. - Okay, so what do we do? Stop here and I just leave, is that it? - Yes. - You're just a poor bastard. Who is it? - How do you expect me to know? You and your questions. I hope it's not your sister. Seb! Broken jaw, ruptured spleen. He's out of emergency care. - He's doing better then. - Yes. - There's a kid, at rugby. He's like us. A great little kid. But a little kid who's alone. I should talk to his parents. - And should I talk to yours? You have to let it all out! Let it out! Tell it all, for fuck's sake, let it all out. Where are you going? Seb, you won't save this kid unless you can save yourself. Come on, dammit. React! We aren't victims any longer. Ciao. Ciao, guys. Bed early tonight. Okay? You have to rest. Coach. The old guy who got beat up in town— he was the one you— - How do you know that? - It's a small town. They all talk to each other. You tell me there's respect, that we're not animals— but actually, you don't know how to speak. You just know how to punch. Why ask me to talk when you won't? You're on a loop. The old man won. - Okay. We'll make a deal, the two of us. I'll speak and so will you. - That's shit. - It's a commitment. I'm terrified, so you're going to have to help me. - What are you going to do to him, to mine, when I tell you who he is? Are you going to beat him up too? - No. No. We let him know that I know. And that I'm looking out for you. And you're going to file a complaint. - With the cops? - That's the deal. You talk—and I break my silence. - Okay. It's— My uncle. He picks me up on Wednesdays after rugby. And then he— I swear if you're not here— - I'll be here on Wednesday. I couldn't even look you in the eye again. And he hurt me. It went on for four years. - I'm going to kill him, the bastard! I'm going to kill him! - Don't do that, Dad. Don't do it! Please, Dad! Dad, please! - I can't even look at you. - Dad. - You were my kid and I didn't see anything! Fucking shit! - It was me who was never able to talk to you. - No no. You didn't do anything, you were just a kid. I should have felt it. It was my job to protect you. Instead of that— instead of that, I left. I left you alone with him. I even told him to keep an eye you, the bastard! I threw you into the lions' den. I'll never forgive myself. - You're not responsible, Dad. Thank you, goodbye. Being thirty years late. I didn't know how to tell you all this. In the end, I lost you. Sorry. Who was it? Nobody. I did it. It'll be OK. See you tomorrow. Coach. Mr. Sébastien Boueilh? - That's me. - You're under arrest. Please come with us. Mr. Lataste was brought back to the emergency room with a suspected concussion. His wife found him unresponsive. She explained to us that four days ago, you attacked him savagely. Do you confirm that? - Yes. - Can I have an explanation? You box, don't you? A combat sport. Do you often knock old people out like that? - Old people, no. - She told us you two had been estranged for years. Is there a reason? - A family dispute. And? Why such anger? What had he done to you? Listen, Mr. Boueilh, I don't think we quite understood each other. The victim is in hospital, in between life and death. What that means is, if he dies, you're looking at a substantial number of years in prison. And that makes you laugh? - Yes, the fact that you call him "the victim". I find that— I find that somewhat inappropriate. - Why "inappropriate"? Okay. The law authorizes me to keep you in custody for 48 hours. - No, 48 hours isn't possible! - Put him in a cell! - No, I have to go and help— a kid in my club. - You calm down. You should have thought of that before. Who is this kid? A minor? - Yes. - So if he's in danger, tell us where he lives, and we'll go there. - I don't know where he lives. Besides, you can't send cops to his house, just like that. That's too much. And then I— I can't do that to him. - Fine, but I can't release you. So either you explain to me, or I apply the law. And the law is to put you in a cell for an act of violence. Is that clear? - Okay. I want to lodge a complaint. - Who are you lodging a complaint against? - I'm going to lodge a complaint of rape. - You can't lodge on behalf of someone else. - I'm not talking about someone else. I— I'm talking about me. César, are you coming? There are no longer any charges against you. Two empty boxes of anxiolytics were found at Mr. Lataste's home. He attempted to commit suicide. And his wife could not deny it. You didn't send him to A & E. I'm sorry. Go on, you can leave. Go and take care of that kid. We'll see each other again soon anyway. - What for? Assault and battery? - No, that's done with. I'm talking about your complaint. I'm in charge of your case. I'm going to have to call your family, witnesses— there will be a lot of people in denial. It'll take a long time. It'll be painful, difficult. But you're no longer alone, Sébastien. You can count on me. Okay? I'm sorry. Come on. César! César! César, don't do it. Don't do it, please. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't move. - I'm going to fall. - No, you're not going to fall. Give me your hand, César. Okay César. Here, I've got you. It's all over. It'll be OK. - It won't be OK. - Yes, it'll be OK, I promise you. TWO YEARS LATER Mélanie from the dry cleaners cleaned it first when she found out it was yours. I think she likes you a lot. - Are you trying to marry me off? - Why not? She's a very nice girl. - And I'm a big boy. - You're beautiful. Beautiful. Do you want me to make you something to eat before we go? - No thanks. - Yes, go on, it won't take long. - Mum, you're stressing me out. I'm not hungry. - My darling. - Right, the tank's full. Look at this mess. Let me do it. - Do you remember the last time you did this? I was 9 years old. You made me tie my tie three times. And in the end, we missed the start of the races. - A good presentation is half of a good engagement. I'm proud of you. Come on, let's go. We're going to be late. Good morning. Sorry I'm late. Morning, Madame. - Good morning. - Are you all right? - Good morning. - Did you sleep well, Sébastien? Ready for confrontation? Let me remind you of the rules: we refused to allow this to be held behind closed doors. So the aggressor can no longer hide. The hearings will be public. Everything you and Tristan say on the stand, will be out there. Everyone will hear it. The gossip, the Press. It's going to be hard. Better to know in advance. - I'm ready. - Perfect. - Tristan's meeting us there. How could one not take refuge behind self-destructive mechanisms? Poor control of impulsive energy, A depressive state brought on by low self-esteem alternating with anxiety. Psychosomatic, psychosexual disorders. All of these. And I'm not the one saying that. The psychiatric expert says it. All this—corresponds in all aspects to post-traumatic symptoms of sexual assault. Because, make no mistake— it was not these two strong men you see in front of you who were raped. But these two little boys. These little ones. Childhood. Childhood is a precious value, Mr. President. To steal childhood is to kill the adult. The crime of raping a minor is—abominable. Heinous, shameful, and fortunately, illegal. The law is not always able to hear— to hear the cries of distress, the suffering of the victims. In their own childhood, Sébastien and Tristan did not know how to shout loudly enough. Is that their fault? No, of course not. A society that wants to hear must be ready to listen, be ready to look in the mirror. So today—will we still remain silent regarding these crimes? No! Today, the rape of a minor is recognized, understood. Today, no one can with impunity demolish a child. we agree with wha Mr. Boueilh's grandmother said. Good things come to those who wait. I just hope they didn't wait—in vain. As for these colossi with feet of clay standing before of you— look at them. Imagine the stages of destruction they went through. Yet they stand here before you. They are clear-eyed. Why? Because shame has changed sides. It lies in your hands—in our hands, not to return to silence. I was very much in love with Sébastien. It's— It was stronger than me. But he too— he was very demanding for his age. - Seb! - No sir. It's called pedophilia. - Ten years! He got ten years. Ten years! The bastard will live with this. Now there's no way he'll get into the cemetery. How much? - Ten years! Ten years! - You're here. - I wasn't going to miss this. Great game. - Thank you. Are you by yourself? - I told them to come along, that you wouldn't bite, but— - That's natural, they'll be uncomfortable with all that. - They blame themselves. - They think I'm made of sugar now. Makes a change from before, when they thought I was messing up everywhere. - They're your parents. They're not perfect. But they love you. What about your uncle? - We're waiting for the trial. We don't see him now. Same with the family, not too much. Just as you said, in fact. You rescued me. - No, it was you who rescued me. - What will you do now? - I have a little idea. Colossus with Feet of Clay Association, can I help you? Friday is possible, yes. Do you want a prevention session in the school? Thanks. Oh yes, children are very curious. But don't worry, they're much stronger than you think. All right, see you Friday. Yes? - I need to talk to you. - When are you leaving? I've been offered a new job and I can't refuse. - That's what I thought. I've never known how to hold on to anything. - And I start on Monday. - Me too, anyway, I'm very busy. Congratulations. - In the Dax A & E. In the Dax emergency room? Really? - I can leave if you prefer. - No. - Seb, we're late. - Yes I'm coming. - Go on, there are children who need you. Good morning. - Good morning. My name is—Sébastien Boueilh. And I'm a former Division One rugby player. And— And I am a victim of rape. I was raped between the ages of 12 and 16. And it took years, before I could talk about it. But the man who did this to me—is in prison today. So the reason I'm here today is to warn you about that sort of person. Because the real culprit— The real culprit—is him. Okay? Not you. Your body belongs to you. So if you're—if you're like me, or if you thinkj a friend is— talk. Talk. Talk to a professional, to a shrink, to a policeman, to an association, to a friend. But talk. Talk. yeah, I know, it's easy to say and— much, much, much harder to do. But it works. It works because silence is the predator's greatest ally. And that—that's silly, isn't it? Your body—? - belongs to you. - It belongs to you. If you're a witness, you must—? - Talk. If you've been through something like this, you need to—? - Talk. - The most important thing is to—? - Talk. Talk, talk, talk. You have to call 119. You have to call 119 to—? - Talk. - Don't be afraid. We can all be little colossi. Have you any questions?
