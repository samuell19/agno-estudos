In the past ten years, over 150 people have been reported missing on the Kennet and Avon Canal... Nobody knew what horror lurked on the 140 kilometer long waterway. Until now... Aah! Why did you pack so much? Well, a girl's got to have her essentials. Pack light. Like all good Scouts, I come prepared. Oh! I love a man in uniform. Have you, uh, got a Scout one in there? Afraid not. - Aw. - Left it behind. Oh, when we get home, then. Oh, I love being out here. Makes me feel so alive. It's going to be a great weekend. I can feel it. As long as it clears up a bit. What a cock. Soph! Oh! I missed you. I missed you too. How the devil... This is Ben. It's an important business call. This is so exciting! We haven't been away together since we were kids! - No! - Oh, come on. I'll get the bags, then. If you do get into any trouble, give that Giles Hussey a ring, okay? He's a top lad. He'll sort you out with anything you need. What have you got there? Oh, Chomper. What you got there, boy? Steered one of these beauties before, have you? Yeah. Used to go with my parents when I was younger. Excellent. Well, you know it's counterintuitive. Push left to go right and vice versa. Yeah. Try not to go too fast. I recommend you stick to two to three miles an hour. Try to go any faster, and you run the risk of losing control. These beauties are... - ...slow to turn. - Got it. Just you operating the barge this weekend, is it? It would appear that way. Well, any trouble, give me a call. Trouble? If you're still planning on coming, you better get on board. Bon voyage. You're not gonna be on that thing all weekend? I'm gonna need help with the barge duties. I'm not really the bargeman type. I've been so looking forward to this weekend. I can't get a bloody phone signal in here. He's quite stressed about work at the moment. He's pushing for a promotion. I do... I do love his dedication, though. What is it he does, again? Oh, he's a... he's a fund manager at Goldman Finance. Huh. I couldn't find a bottle opener. - Always come prepared. - Hey. Cheers. I knew you'd serve a purpose on this trip. So, what do you think of Ben? Well, look, Sophie is happy, so play nice. I always play nice. I just think Ben is more interested in his phone than in human interaction. Seeing as it's you, I'll make an effort. Aw. Do you want a go? - Maybe later. - Come on! Oh. Uh... That's it. Hold it steady. Nothing to it. So here we are. On a barge for one crazy weekend of fun and laughter. Who knows where it'll take us, what we'll see and do? But as long as the beer is flowing, the barge will be a-rocking. Oh! - Everything okay? - I need to charge my phone. I think Kat was charging hers there. My needs are greater. - This is great, isn't it? - It's a bit too cozy for me. I can barely stand up straight in here. I don't understand why we couldn't have gone away somewhere hot, just the two of us. Well, I thought it was nice that Kat invited us. After Mum, we need this. I just thought it'd be nice to spend some time together alone, that's all. Yeah, babe, and we will. But please just make more of an effort. This means a lot to me. You guys okay with mooring up for a bit? Get some food, maybe do a bit of fishing? Yeah, I think we'll give the fishing a miss, okay? Come on! You've been in there for ages. I need to piss! Five more minute. I can't hold it any longer. Where are you going? If it's good enough for the bears... So, you and Ben? He's great, isn't he? - Aw. - You do like him, don't you? Yeah, of course. Where do you see it going, though? Do I, uh... Do I hear the distant sound of wedding bells? Oh! Easy. We've only been together a couple of months. Although we have fallen head over heels for each other. No, we have talked about these things. What, really? I was only joking about the whole wedding thing. Oh, Ben is a man of structure. He likes to plan things out. No shit. I like that about him. Anyway, what about you and Mark? Surely you two have had the talk by now. Mark is spontaneous. He doesn't like to plan too far ahead. Yeah, but you must have some idea where it's heading. We've both been hurt in the past. We're just taking it step by step. I like it like that. He's happy. I'm happy. It's cool. You know, Mum really liked him, though. She said, "You've got a good un there." Do you think Mum would have liked Ben? Yeah. Sure. I'm not sure that Dad would, though. Yeah, well, Dad never liked any of our boyfriends. I remember when you brought Mike Tucker home for the first time, and he caught you necking on in the kitchen. - Do you remember? - Tucker the Fucker. - Tucker the Fucker! - Ohh... Mum didn't like him at all. She said he was no good for me. Yeah. She was right, though. She always was. Mm! I'm so glad you came. - Uh! - Me too. I knew I shouldn't have come on this bloody trip. I can't get a signal anywhere. That's the point of this trip, to enjoy being away from everything. Some people have a very different idea of enjoyment. You won't catch much in these waters. - Not living, anyways. - Why is that? Cyanobacteria. This place is riddled with it. "Cyano" what? It's a form of bacteria common in rivers and canals. It's worsened over the years due to climate change. Don't worry... It's not deadly to humans. Although there have been cases of it causing skin rashes, vomiting, explosive diarrhea. Great. You're okay as long as you don't drink any. I'd advise not to swim in it, either. Wasn't planning on it. Thanks for the heads-up. Shit. I think I've got something here. Get that filthy water away from me. - I told you. - Is that... ...blood? I think you'd be surprised what you miss from the city. Nah. Not me. Take a look around. This is the life for me. A life free of conformity. No getting up early to do a job we hate to buy shite we don't need. What about you? Would you trade life in the city with life in the country? Cow shit and suits don't mix. You guys are nuts. The fresh air. The freedom. Totally isolated in your own paradise, away from all the strains and stresses of urban life. Why are you slowing down? What do we do now? You're gonna hop off, open that gate. Then once we're inside the chamber, close them. Use the lock key to let the water in. Once we're on the same level as the water, open the gates, and away we go. It's simple. If it's that simple, why don't you do it? You said earlier you weren't the boating type. Someone has to steer the ship. - Here. - What's this? It's the lock key for the gates. Jerry, you old rascal! What's the latest? - How are you feeling? - Feeling tired. A bit tipsy, more like. Steering this thing isn't as easy as it looks, you know? It takes concentration. Hey, you know what? Ben needs to take over. - Yeah, good luck with that. - Yeah. Mark's not feeling too good, so could you, uh, take over for a while? I'm not surprised, all that beer he's been drinking. Oh, come on, you can't expect him to steer this thing the whole weekend. I don't know how to. Well, maybe if you'd take your face out your phone, you'd know. Come on, babe. Okay. It can't be that bleeding difficult if he can do it. What's that supposed to mean? I'm here to relieve you for a bit. Okay. You move it right to go left... Yeah, yeah. I got it. Aah! Ah, who designed these godforsaken things? Hey! Hey! What the fuck you playing at? That's my barge, you fucking prick! Huh? Fucking dickhead. What are you fucking playing at? Really sorry, mate. Rookie mistake. Don't you fucking "mate" me. You're gonna pay for the damage or what? Look at my fucking barge! This is our fucking home, you pricks! You can't just hit our barge and get away with it! We're really sorry, love. What the fuck?! Sorry?! Go back to your barge home, you scatter monkey. What the fuck did you call me?! This ain't over, you posh prick! No! No! No! Aah! Baby. You all right, Ben? Oh! There she is. Where are we? I don't really know. This place wasn't in the map or in the guidebook. I'm just following these. Great. We're lost, then. Hello, Dad? Dad? Yeah, we got really bad signal. Yeah, the countryside is beautiful. I can see why Mum loved it so much. Yeah, Soph's here. She says hi. We're off to something called the Jolly Farmer. Dad? Dad? Shit. Chomper! Chomper! Here, boy! Here, boy! Have you seen my dog? Uh, no, mate. Sorry. I'd get in your barge and go back the way you came if I was you. Why? It isn't safe around these parts at night. - Not safe how? - Chomper! It's already too late for you. Hope you find your dog. What was that all about? I guess he just wants to find his dog. Come on. Blade? Hammerhead? Is that you? Aah! There. You folks lost? Well? Do you want a drink or no? I'll have a pint of lager, please, love. And I will have a glass of pinot grigio. A large glass of house white? White wine, then? We've no hot food left for today. - You've got to be kidding me. - We're out of fresh meat. All I can offer you is a sandwich or a packet of crisps. Liquid dinner it is, then. Uh, babe, just grab me a white wine. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Yeah, yeah. Get the same for me, too, please. I'll come with you. Two white wines as well, please, love. I'm bloody starving. Get a packet of crisps, then. Crisps aren't gonna fill me up. All I wanted was a hot meal. A steak or something. Is that it? Uh, two packets crisps as well, please. - Flavor? - Scampi Fries? Sure you don't want any? What's the damage? £14.56 Contactless? Cash only. - Cheers. - Hmm. Not bad, this place, is it? I've seen better. A lot better. - Do you want to get a table? - Hang on. - What can I get you? - Three pints, please. Who's the third one for? I'm thirsty. If one's for the young un you've left in the garden, then I need to see I.D. Look, he's old enough. I.D., or all I serve him is pop. I don't see what your problem is. Losing my license is what my problem is if I serve alcohol to underage kids. Who the fuck's gonna know? We're in the middle of nowhere. - I know. - How much is a Coke? £2.50 How much? You don't like it, go somewhere else. Shit. - It's them. - Who? The nutters whose barge you hit earlier. - Give me your phone. - Why? - So I can call the police. - I'm not calling the police. This place is disgusting. Yeah, well, that's what being in the countryside is all about... getting deep down and dirty. Come on, then. Kat! Over here. Ah. Thank you. What? - It's them. - Who? The dickheads who hit our barge. There ain't gonna be no trouble in here tonight. What's this about you calling my missus a monkey? Technically, I called her a scatter monkey. Here! What did I tell you? Leave it alone! This ain't none of your business. This is my business. Look, we said we were sorry. - Sorry ain't gonna cut it. - Look, you owe us money. Well, you owe me a new phone, which is worth more than that crappy barge you call home, so let's call it quits. I don't like the way you posh city pricks come around here thinking you're better than us. This is crazy. Why don't we just chill out? Oh, look at what we got here... some fucking Cornish bumpkin bitch who thinks she can come in here and tell us what to do. Actually, I'm Bristolian. Oh, Bristolian, Cornish. All the same fucking inbred cunts to me. You should just fuck off back to where you came from. Hey, hey! Don't you fucking dare, all right? I'll kill you! Hey, hey, hey! I'll fucking kill you! All right?! Okay! Nobody is killing anybody. Not in my pub. I warned you lot not to start any trouble. Now get out of my pub! You heard the old lady. Go on, get the fuck out. I wasn't talking to them. Come on, you can't be siding with these city pricks. Coming in here, upsetting my nice, peaceful atmosphere. Now get out, or I swear to God your shit for brains will be decorating these walls. Believe it. Let's go. I don't see why we're being thrown out. My pub, my rules. Now get out. I apologize for the countryside welcome. But we're not all that bad. I promise. I think we should leave. No, we just... J-Just chill. Have a drink. Local speciality. Compliments of the house. Please. For your journey. But go steady with it. Smells like cheap whiskey. Enjoy. - Cheers. - Yeah, thanks. - I'm not drinking that. - Oh, come on. Just have one. To absent loved ones. - Absent loved ones. - Absent loved ones. That was as bad as it smelled. - Oh, is this us? - Let me see. - We're back, guys. - This is most definitely us. You all right? I don't know how I feel about this now. Oh! Okay, you have to step... Ah! Coming aboard. Where'd you go? Oh! Coming, coming. Ugh. I'm afraid we're out of the weekend supply of booze already. - Ohh. - Oh. I'll have to find somewhere tomorrow. In the meantime... Oh, nope, nope. No more of that stuff, thank you. I'm afraid the old lady's home brew is all we have left. I don't feel too good. What's going on? Calm down, ladies. It's just the lights acting up. Hey! All right. I am gonna go to bed. Are you okay, hon? I'll be fine. I just need to sleep. Okay. I will be in in a bit. Okay. Night, all! Good night! Is he gonna be okay? Yeah, he's all right. He's just not much of a drinker. - What do you see in him? - I, on the other hand, am. Did I ever tell you about the time when... What was that? Calm down, ladies. Just chill. - What if it's them? - It won't be. Please don't go out there. We don't want any more trouble. You worry too much. What's that for? - Just in case. - Just in case what? Please don't tell me you're gonna use it. I won't. I'll be right back. Idiot. Hello! That wasn't funny. Mark, come back inside now, please. You okay? Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think I should go to bed. - I think I'll join you. - Mm. I don't feel so good. Mark, I just want to go to bed! Oh! Ho ho! I like a bird who's direct. - What do you want? - What's owed to us. Sophie! Sophie! Wait here. Give us a shout if anyone comes. Fine. Oi. Tie them up. Posh boy is in the bedroom. Oi, you come back here! Don't you dare turn your back! Get in here! Come on! Get down there! Go! Fuck. That's some strong shit. Look, just take what you want and leave. Please don't take that. I need it. Why? So you can call the filth? No fucking chance! It's mine now. You got any dirty pictures in there? Hello. Who's the MILF? That's my mum. Please, take anything, but don't take it. Her mum's gone! You fucking scumbag! Shame. She's hot. Runs in the family. - Let's go. - We're done when I say we are. And I'm not done yet. Max. Fuck is going on? Max! Max! Max, speak to me! Speak! Max. Speak to me! My head's pounding. What's going on? Jesus fucking Christ! - Fucking untie me! - Only if you help us! - Yes! - Promise! I fucking promise! Aah! Aaah! Aaah! Sophie! Please don't kill me! I'll give you anything you want. Here! Take it. It's a Rollie. Uh, okay. Uh, money, then. Uh, I can transfer £5,000 into your account. Ben! Your money is of no use to me. - What do you want? - Your flesh! Stop! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ricky! Ricky! Ricky! Ricky! Ricky! Ricky! Ricky! Ricky! Ricky! Ben! Ben! Sophie! Sophie! No! No, no, no! No! No! No, no, no! I'm not leaving her! I'm not leaving her. Get out of here! Fine! Kat! Go! I'll get them. I promise. You coming or what?! We're not waiting around! Go to the pub. Phone the police and sit tight. We'll be right behind you. Go! Now! Mark... Aah! Aah! No, Blade. We need him alive. Why are you going that way when the pub is back there? Fuck that! I'm not going near that old piss stain! She's just as nuts as those fuckers! But we need to get help, and he needs to go to hospital. I fucking stayed and helped your fella, didn't I? We wouldn't even be in this mess if it wasn't for you. Fuck you! How were we supposed to know they'd come on the fucking barge and try and eat us? Well, if you hadn't tied us up, maybe... maybe we'd have been able to do something! They were gonna fucking murder you anyway! - We saved you! - Saved me?! My boyfriend is back there fighting them! My sister and her boyfriend might be dead for all I know. I lost my little brother tonight! He was the only family I had left! Look, I'm sorry about your brother, okay? I am. But, look, we have got to work together if we're gonna survive. Okay, please? You're on your own. - She's got a gun. - What? The old bag at the pub. She's got a gun. Do you even fucking know where you're going? It's got to be around here somewhere. You don't have a fucking clue! Shh! What the fuck was that? They're hunting us. Aaah! Aah! Please help me! What are you waiting for?! Aah! We need to go! This is your fault! You wouldn't get the fuck off of the barge! - No! - Leave me! I'm not leaving you! Come on! Come on! Aah! Come on! We got to keep moving. Come on! - I've got nothing left. - Sure you do! He was the love of my life! Without him or Max, I'm alone! I got nothing left! I know it's hard, okay? - Hard?! - Yeah. You were born with a fucking silver spoon in your mouth! You never lost anything or anyone! We all lose the things we care about at some point! You see this? This was my mother's. The day I lost her, I never felt so alone, so don't you fucking tell me I've got it easy! Now, we are both in the same mess together. And I don't know about you, but I'm not fucking ready to die yet! Mark?! - Where are you going?! - We've got to help him! We can call the pigs when we get to the bar! No, no! It'll be too late by then! Come on! Oh, fuck! Why are you doing this? We're hungry. No. Oh, no, please, please, please! You eat. Keep him alive. Why? Get it over with. We enjoy your suffering, feasting on your flesh while you struggle for breath. Fucking savages! Aaah! Mark. Shit! What are you doing? What are you doing? We've got to do something. That's exactly what they want. You go in there, you'll be their fucking next meal. - What do you suggest? - I'll go in. I'll get their attention, and you grab him. Wait, wait. What? Bet you had good parents who brought you up right. Yeah, well, my dad fucked off before I could walk, and my mum was a junkie whore. I did my best raising and protecting Max best I could. He was everything to me. He was the only good thing I did in my poor excuse for a fucking life, and those fuckers have taken him from me. I'm Kat. Jade. I wish I could say that it was nice to meet you. I wish I never fucking did. Do you want some?! Come on, then, you cunts! Aah! Aaaah! Where is she? - Where is the other one? - Fuck you! I'm coming! Go! Come on, then, you amphibian cocksucker! Oh, fuck! Go. Shh, shh, shh, shh. I've got you. Okay. I've got you. I've got you. I've got you. - Fuck! - Shh, shh. Where's Sophie? Where's Sophie? Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh! I promi... I promised my mum I'd look after her. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I froze! I froze! That bastard was right there, and I froze. He moved right at the last minute, and... I killed Ben. I killed Ben. You have to go without me. I can't. I can't. The quicker you get going, the quicker you get out. I can't. Your mom told me about you when you was little. About whenever you fell down or hurt yourself... ...you wouldn't cry or make a fuss. You just got right back up. As though she knew you would be okay. I'll be back for you. I promise. I know you will. Now go. I'm timing you. No, no, no. No, no. Please stop. Stop, stop! - Stop! - Jesus! Please, just drive! Drive, drive, drive. Please drive! - All right, love. Calm down. - No, listen, please. There is a creature out there. It is trying to kill me. And I think it's gonna kill my boyfriend too. Creature? What are you talking about? I need to get help. Please, just take me to the nearest town, please! Please! Drive, drive, drive! You want to tell me what the hell it was that was after you? I don't know what they are. All I know is my boyfriend is still back there, and they'll kill him if I don't get help. All right. I'll take you to the nearest police station. There's one about 30 miles away. You'll be all right. You hurt? Just cuts and scratches. Well, you're safe now, love. Bet you're glad you run into me, eh? Be hard-pressed to find anyone driving around these back roads, even if it wasn't the middle of the night. Have you driven down this way before? Yeah, yeah. All the time. In fact, the company make me do it at night. It's... It's a bit of a sensitive matter we do with biochemical waste management. Yeah, basically dumping all the bad shit they don't want at the factory. Oh, don't worry, it's all legal. It's just that they get a hassle from, uh, all these bloody do-gooders. Environmental protectionists and all that sort of crap. They worry it's gonna do something to the animals around here. Well, I just think it's an urban myth. I should think we'd know by now if it was gonna do any harm, eh? Oh! - What was that?! - Bloody hell. Damn tire. These bloody roads! No, no. No, no. Don't slow down. Well, I got not choice. I got to change the tire. Well, it'll only take a minute. I've had to change more flat tires than I care to admit. Okay, but please, please, please be quick. It'll be all right. Bloody hell. He's there! He's there! He's there! Behind you! What the bloody hell's the matter now? Behind you! I told you I can't go anywhere until I change this tire. Turn around! Look out! Aah! No. Aah! I told you to go back the way you came, but you didn't listen. What are you doing here? I warned you that they have eyes and ears everywhere in these parts. - Who? - Them. What are they? Outcasts of society, forced to live upon these canals some 35 years ago. Predator family of deformed evil freaks, a product of incest, lawlessness, and cannibalism, scouring the canals for their next meal. Evil predators is what they be, and they won't stop until we're all dead. - Do you hear me?! - Shh! Shh, shh. Shh, shh. We're just their next meal. You need to rest. Take it easy. What? Where am I? I found you outside. How... How did I get here? We need to get help. I-I left Mark in the woods. And the others. And my sister. Mark is fine. Where is he? He's upstairs, getting some rest. He's badly injured, but he'll be fine. I need to see him. You'll see him soon, dear. All in due course. These monsters, they came onto our barge and they attacked us and they... They killed my fucking sister. There, there, dear. You're safe in here. You don't understand. If one of them gets in here, they'll fucking tear us apart. Now, you sit down, and I'll get you something to eat. I'm not hungry. Don't be silly, dear. You need to build your strength up. - Seriously, I can't... - You need to eat. Get some meat on your bones. I-I thought you said you were out of fresh meat. I just got a new batch in. Your sister. Tastes so good. What the hell are you people?! It's just the usual Friday-night fun. Where's the others? I'm gonna make you pay for what you and your friends did to my family. These monsters butchered my family! My family are not monsters. We feed our hunger just like everyone else. You may not have fur or feathers, but you are still part of the food chain. I tell my boys never to play with their food, but I'll make an exception for you. Take her to the kitchen. We'll have her for breakfast. Mark. I love you. You feel this need to put your faith into something, a higher power that you believe to exist. You need to believe that life is eternal and has meaning. In a very short moment, your final thoughts will be to realize that it doesn't. My family have been feeding on the flesh for years. You're not the first... ...and you most certainly won't be the last. It's nothing personal. No one escapes. No! No! No, no, no! No! No! No, no!
