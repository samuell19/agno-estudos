NETFLIX PRESENTS [suspenseful orchestral music playing] [cheerful music playing] [music continues] [man] Very close to... checkmate. Huh? Your move. - No, Nika, think about it. - I'm thinking, Daddy. - Not really. - [bell dings] - [Nika] Mommy! - If... - [boy] Mommy. - [Nika] Race you there. - Need you both to stay off the grass. - You're home! - I missed you so much! - Mela! - How many times do I have to say it? - [boy] Mommy! [woman] Mela, come. Okay, you take that one. - Okay, there you go. - [boy] All good. Thank you very much. What did I say? Was there traffic? No. It's just hard finding everything for your diet. - But you did it? - Of course. Why aren't you bike riding? [scoffs] And leave them alone? So they can destroy my lawn? I just fertilized it. Mm-hmm. You have a nice day. - Keep an eye on them. - [chuckles] Sweetie, don't eat so fast. It's not healthy. Chew your food, okay? [sighs] If the pasta was al dente, I'd have something to chew. So, I was thinking about going to the movies tomorrow after church? Maybe you should run things by me before making decisions? I can't tomorrow. I have a business tennis match at Czerwiński's. [chuckles softly] Ah, right. - He owns a restaurant? - Among other things. It's a good contact for this family to have. Hmm. And he plays well? - I play his wife. - [chuckles] I know her. The new one. [laughs] With plastic in her boobies. [giggling] There's nothing wrong with that? It's even considered good taste nowadays. - [footsteps approaching] - [dog grunts] - Good girl. - [toy squeaks] How is this even possible, huh? Mela, leave that. Everything was clean this morning. That's kids for you. Constant hassle, constant hassle. [Magda] Maybe this year we could take part in Open Gardens? No way. They'll trample my lawn. [Mela growls playfully] Thomas. I'm taking the dog for a walk. Come on. [smacks lips] Come on, come on. Let's go, come on. - Mela. - [phone chimes] [Chinese folk song playing] [cell phone ringing] Is it important? Because I'm fanning. You're not gonna believe it. Thomas bought me perfume. You do know those tiny bottles are samples and they give them out for free? [chuckles] No. He got something fancy, very expensive, actually. Yeah, and how much does it cost? Did he give you the receipt? No, it fell out of his pocket. Does it smell nice at least? Well, he didn't give it to me yet. Come on, Mela, come on. Go to the park. Then maybe it's not really for you? [Magda chuckles] Who's it for then? When was the last time he bought you something? Hoo! Hmm... It was the board. It was very expensive. Ah... The surfboard, right? Yes, surfing while I iron his clothes. [chuckles] I think he's messing around. [Mela barks] Mela! [suspenseful music playing] Mela! - [Magda whistles] - [Mela barks] Magda? Hey! [whistles] - Hey, Magda. - [barking] Hey, I was joking. You there? What happened to your sense of humor? It was a joke. [Mela barks] [Elka] Magda! [indistinct police radio chatter] [bag unzips] [indistinct conversation] [zips] Are you... Are you okay? Of course, I'm fine. I'm pretty sure it's the first murder we've had in Podkowa Leśna, huh? Did you know her? Not at all. She wasn't from here. How do you know? Well, because she was dressed like she was going to a party. She was walking to the train, probably going home, which means she doesn't live here. You know... when she was alive. Exactly what I was thinking. Exactly. Did you see anything? Nothing. I found her exactly 37 minutes ago. She must've died just before that because he was still bleeding. Got it. Spare me the details. If you ask me about the estimated time of death, I'd say... - I'm not asking. - Somewhere close to 10:20. Not your problem. I was on Modrzewiowa a bit earlier, I walked past Stefan. - He was leaving the park. - Yeah? And how do you know it was Stefan? Explain how you saw him in the dark? Very simple. Because I saw him. And how can you be so sure? Are you like a forensic scientist from CSI or something? Agatha Christie. Positively. [officer] Inspector. The DA wants to speak to you. - It's okay. - Please stop. Stop. [Magda whispering] Jason! [church bell tolls] One murder and you're a celebrity. Well, well. - Mom, can we go for ice cream? - Okay, okay. I want four scoops. [laughs] Four. Yeah, right. Two at most. Two. Three. Children and fish don't have a voice. Magda, dear! [sighs] My goodness. - Mom, are you famous? - Yeah. - Extremely famous. - Magda, dear! We'll meet you there. Okay. - Good morning. - Good morning. Dear, help us, please? Did you really find that woman? And... was it someone from here? - Stop it, I'm not listening to this. - You still wear it. Weronica wore one just like it. You must... you must come visit. - Come for tea. I'll bake a cake. - Okay... Leave it, Wanda. If she hasn't returned in all these years, why'd she come home now? I'd love to come. Please. Sorry, I'm late. Goodbye. Do visit. [big band music playing] Mommy? Did you know those people? Um... Weronica's parents. The one who died? Well... she's missing. Nobody knows where she is. Not even you? Mmm. Nobody, not even me. [man] Ms. Magda. [Magda] Oh! - Such a pleasure. - Small world! Um... Honey, this is Dr. Walczak. - Ah. - The vet where we take Mela. You take her. What's up? [Walczak] Nice to meet you. Uh... I must have conjured you with my thoughts. Yeah? Do you remember Dr. Milaszewski? - Yes. - He recently moved to Warsaw. And I was thinking maybe you'd be tempted to take a part-time job at my clinic? Oh... Oh, no. Well, it would be fantastic to go back to my work, for sure. But I haven't worked in so long that... You'd be wonderful at it. You just need to believe in yourself. Well, sure, sure. Honey, I thought we decided that until the children grow up you'll be taking care of the home, am I right? I'm right. It's what we said. Yes, yes, that's right, yes. Apologies. Hmm. My offer's open if you change your mind. Not sure I'll be able to keep the position open until your children get married. [laughs] - I'll try to remain positive. - [Magda laughs] Good day. Not sure why that's funny. [giggles] [engine revs] ROBERT MAZUR PSYCHIC, THERAPIST [melancholy music playing] So what? It's my friend... My friend is missing. We wore identical necklaces. That's all the money I have. I'm sorry. I'm aware of the person you seek but I can't help. [sighs] What are you saying? It's not enough? It's an extremely serious matter. In the world of energy, everything needs to be... totally balanced. And in a matter like this, the payment also needs to be very high. Otherwise, the process won't yield results. Yeah, but... you haven't even seen how much it is. [Magda sobs] I'm very sorry. Those are the rules of the cosmos. [Magda sobs] [sobs] Whoa! Wow. I'm so strong today! - [Thomas] Straight to the neighbors. - Whoa. Energy! [giggles] [grunts] [Thomas] That one's for the clouds. - [wings flapping] - [birds screeching] [Thomas chuckles] Playing with you is such a pleasure. [giggles] Go ahead. Did you see me? Yes, I saw everything. Absolutely everything. Yes, yes, Susie's getting better and better. She's almost a professional. Based on how much I spend on her trainer, she should have already won Wimbledon. [Thomas chuckles] You shouldn't have drunk so much at Szeliga's yesterday. Wonderful party. Like a gossip magazine. So many celebrities. I have photos, you have to see them. Excellent. In that case, you should come over today for a drink. - Consider it a little rematch. - No. I'm going to take the day off and rest. Thank you. Oh. My wife, Magda. Magda, you know Susie. Her husband, Mr. Jarosław Czerwiński. I've invited them over for dinner. I know what you mean about both being tired, we didn't sleep much last night either. Because last night she found dead body in the park. Serious? Someone died in the park? Where? In the park. The one next to City Hall. [Susie] Incredible. My God, you really are lucky. - How did she die? - [chuckles] She was stabbed. Oh, my God. I just got goosebumps. - Teddy bear, look. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. What time tonight? - Nice, huh? - [Thomas laughs] Amazing. - He's in a TV show. - Wow. [Magda flatly] Wow. Ms. Magda, are you from Podkowa? Yes, I was born here. I envy you. It must have been wonderful growing up in such a beautiful place. Yes, it was, it was. Yes. It's unbelievable that a place like this could have such gruesome murder. Teddy bear! Don't start again, please. You know when I hear about that body, I just... [shivers] - Yes, froggy, you get goosebumps. I know. - I do. Tell me, Magda, what happened? I was out walking the dog like usual and suddenly she disappeared so I went to look for her. Then I saw her, laying there, completely dead. Where was that? [Magda] In the park, close to the train station. - Any security monitors? - Yes. Yes, there are, but they don't cover that part. so... murderer was pretty fortunate. But you didn't see him? No. I remember seeing Stefan, our local drunk, and the police think it's him but I'm sure it wasn't. You don't think so? Come on, Magda. Magda. Don't bore them with your silly stories, please. [dramatic music playing] That's the girl. What? What girl? That's the murdered woman that I found. I have to call Sikora. [Thomas] Come on, Magda. Sikora who? Inspector Jason Sikora? Yes. They know each other from school. He'll probably show up since he lives next door. You have to pardon my wife. [chuckles] - Jason isn't picking up, probably asleep. - Mm. Where did they go? They took off. Good job. Excuse me? Why the hell did you tell them about that dead body? I'm trying to do business here, remember? Sorry, but he's the one who asked me about it. Yeah, I know. Because of you they left so fast, they forgot those damn photos. Hard to fathom why no one invites us to those parties. [exhales] I'm really sorry. I'll clean up. Just give me a second. Clean up or don't clean up, I don't give a shit. [stomping] [door slams] [tense music playing] - What's this? - Me and Weronica at the fair. So what? Look at that. - What? - She has Weronica's necklace. She spelled her name with a W. [Jason] Isn't that the victim? - Where did you get this? - Czerwiński's new wife took it. At Szeliga's party that night I was just about to check that evening if there were any parties. There was one, Szeliga's. Obviously to celebrate his run for the Senate. That's what I just said! Might be helpful to find that guest list. Then we'll find out the woman's identity. Precisely what I was doing before you got here! Do you have any more pictures? Yup. Let me have it. This is police business. Gracie!! Jason, it's my business as well. I need to know where she got my friends necklace. Print this out. Not "her" necklace, but one similar. It's the same. Because it was a present from me. This is a murder investigation, not a necklace theft investigation. I also need to know, because it might lead to Weronica. That case has been closed. Weronica ran away 15 years ago, now she's somewhere in London or Pernambuco and doesn't give a damn about any of this No. I know she wouldn't leave me alone like that. Well, maybe it's finally time you left her alone. [emotional music playing] Elka! [Elka] Yeah? - What happened now? - It's so weird. Do you remember this necklaces? Weronika had one just like it, but in the shape of the letter W. No, Magda, I'm not talking to you about Weronika. I know, but the thing is the woman I found had an identical necklace. Let's change the subject, did you get the perfume? I didn't. But do you know someone in Podkowa who makes these necklaces? Did you check the date on Tommy's receipt? Because maybe he bought it a long time ago, it wasn't for you. I don't know why you all dislike him so much. [Elka] Come in, I'll gladly explain it to you, I just don't know if you have that much time. There's a jeweler named Bodzio. Lives in a wooden house like something out of a Hitchcock in Kwiatowa. [kisses] I love you. [wearily] I love you too. [sighs] [mysterious music playing] GOLDSMITH [knocking] Hello, is anybody here? PODKOWA ARTIST DAZZLES NEW YORK! [dramatic music playing] [gasps] It's not real. I don't usually welcome my guests like this, but... my workshop is full of merchandise. In a couple of days, the sheik of Qatar will be visiting Mazur. And all sheiks like gold, don't they? So I've been working on a new collection. [Magda] Ah, yes. Beautiful! Wow. Do you know that Mazur totally healed the sheik's kitten? From a photograph. He looked at it... and it was cured. Stunning! Stunning. Yeah. Yeah. And now the sheik is coming to personally thank him. [Magda] Ah. [chewing sounds] Fifi, you rascal. It's not nice to eat like that. Bad dog. Fifi, Fifi, Fifi. [Magda] My goodness! My buttercup, my sweet little glutton. She ate dark chocolate. We need to get her to the vet immediately. It's poisonous for her. Come on. Hurry. Hello, we're here to see the doctor. Uh, the doctor isn't here at the moment. Fifi is really shaking. Magda Borowska. I work here. Perfect. - Let's go. - Excuse me, ma'am! - You can't go in. I have other patients. - Thank you. My little froggy. Sweet baby strawberry. I'm so worried about her. Well, hello. Are you the new employee? It was an urgent matter. - Poisoned by dark chocolate. - Oh. - Afternoon. - Hello, doctor. Hi, sweet little girl. Well, well. Very well done. I find it difficult making injections in small veins. Well, I've had training. Of course. Will you be starting tomorrow? [giggles] No. No, no, it was just an emergency situation. Pleased, Magda. Maybe it's time you did something for yourself. [dog yaps] - I wanted to ask about something. - What? Do you recognize this necklace? [chuckles] Of course. That's my handiwork. I made one for each letter of the alphabet. Lovely, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, uh... So there's only one "W" then? Well, unless someone created a forgery, then yeah. POLICE [suspenseful music playing] [music fades] Who found him? Our guys. They were combing through the abandoned buildings like you asked. Very good job. - Smells like booze. - Right. Although he was broke, couldn't afford it. So, the motive was robbery. Excellent. Great police work. [Magda] You're rushing to conclusions if you ask me. Who let her in? - It's just Magda. - What's that mean? It's Magda. This whole murder-for-booze-money thing really doesn't hold up. Stefan used to mow lawns for money, he sometimes collected scrap metal. I know he was not capable. What are you? A profiler now? That necklace was Weronica's, no doubt about it. - What are you saying? - So they knew each other. She could've gotten the necklace in a million different ways. Means nothing. But here we have a murderer, we have a motive. And so the case is closed. All right. Just tell me one thing, did the dead girl have a necklace? - Was the dead girl wearing a necklace? - No, sir. - No. - No wonder. That's because someone stole it. Stefan. Then he sold it and bought booze and the booze killed him. - Jason... - Just... Will you please just get out of here... - It doesn't make sense. - Goodbye. - [cell phone ringing] - Just wanted to say sorry for Stefan. Hello? Yes. Please tell Mr. Mazur that I'm coming. And that I'm sorry. Yeah. Is that Robert Mazur? Are you still here? Begone, acetone. Away, ammonia. Away, arsenic. Away, benzopyrene, butane, vinyl chloride. Away with you, tarry substances, hydrogen cyanide and DDT. You're late. The therapy already started. [Mazur] Begone, formaldehyde, cadmium, methanol, naphthylamin, carbon monoxide. Toluidine, urethane, and nicotine, away with you! Away with you, away with... Inspector? That's right, uh... Official business. It's about the sheik. Just give me a moment. Okay? Uh, fantastic job everyone! Thank you all very much, that'll be all. And shake it off, shake it off. Thank you very much. Please go to the front desk. [clock ringing] And can you tell me, because... the thing... the kitten... it's... How did you do it like that? From a distance? It's incredible. Well, all I needed was a photo this time. How can I possibly explain it? [door closes] In short, you know, in the world of esoteric energies... [woman] He's right in here. ...time and space do not exist at all. Do you understand? [scoffs] I mean, yes. I mean, obviously. And the sheik pays, obviously. Ah, Ms. Magda. - What are you doing here? - She said she was your partner. [Jason] Um... [clears throat] Partner? And how is that? Well, how much does it cost nowadays to heal a cat? [chuckles] Magda, it's not like that. I'm very sorry. I'll be back in a moment. - Jason... - Come on. I know how to get to him. I had some business with him, so... It's not up for discussion. - Out. - Jason, come on. He's just a plain old, greedy, pompous, selfish, overinflated buffoon. He didn't want to help me find Weronika because I didn't have enough money. Let me explain. Do you know who's about to come to Podkowa? The sheik of Qatar. - How do you know? - Everyone knows. Yeah? If you're so smart, find out who your husband bought that perfume for. [emotional music playing] [music fades] When did he buy it? About two weeks ago. So, you see? Maybe there is another explanation. Ask him. I won't, because I'm a coward. Yup. Maybe he wants for us to get a divorce? I don't know about a divorce, more probable it's just a fling. - Trying to cheer me up, huh? - Magda, you don't work. He controls you because he supports you financially. - Arrangement for the good of the children. - Yeah. And he knows very well that when a wife finds her husband in bed with a lover, she'll think twice before giving him hell instead of breakfast. I'm supposed to give him breakfast? I was thinking more about giving him hell. I don't know... So far, it's all circumstantial. Then make him breakfast. [door opens] Oh, my brother. Oh, Jesus. Where's the vodka? You know vodka upsets your stomach. I'll pour you some wine. Magda. - I'm sorry. - I'm not talking to you. It wasn't Stefan. Say what? It wasn't Stefan, okay. I told you. I knew it. I knew it wasn't Stefan. I told you from the beginning. So now you're gonna do a victory dance? Of course not. What do we have? First of all, we made sure the fingerprints from the murder weapon did not belong to Stefan. Obviously! Good. Fingerprints, what else? Secondly, he was also murdered, okay? With a blunt object to the back of the head. Made to look like an accident. Bad idea. Please stop. - Give me your phone. - What for? Give me your phone. All right. Okay. I'll set my number as your emergency number. When you quickly press the off button three times, it immediately sends your location to me... with a photo from the front and back camera. And then what? - Then I come pick you up. - With the sirens? Stefan died because he saw the murderer. And so you're probably in danger. But I didn't see anyone. But the murderer doesn't know that you didn't see anyone. [ringtone plays "The Pink Panther Theme"] Tomas. Hello? Yeah. Um, I'll be there in a minute. I should to run. Maybe he wants to give you the perfume. I'll give you a lift home. Just to make sure you're safe. [Thomas] I don't like you riding around on a moped with strange guys. It's not a strange guy, it's just Jason. Mm-hmm. Besides, do you know why he gave me a ride? No, but I can't wait to find out. Well, it's because my life is in serious danger. [laughs] She's in serious danger! Yeah. You have a better chance of being killed by donuts. Sugar, the silent killer. [Thomas laughs] She's in serious danger. [emotional music playing] [knocking] Come in. Good morning. Good morning. It's 8:00. I wasn't really expecting you, but I'm happy you're here. - [telephone ringing] - Excuse me. Uh, yes, how can I help you? [Walczak] Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Let me see. Someone will be there shortly. Ms. Magda, how about we start with your first assignment. A dog has a symptom of an ear infection. Liliowa 18. Can you go there? I can't leave now. [Magda] Mm-hmm. Oh, fudge. [mysterious music playing] Inspector Sikora. What brings you here? Maybe we should sit. Thank you. What a wonderful home. Well, I'm here for the first time... Very impressive. First time? From now on, you'll be on our regular guest list. Thank you. Um... [clears throat] This girl was at your party on Saturday. Do you know her? She was murdered that night. Yes, I heard. I heard. Ugh. Ghastly situation. In Podkowa... I'd hate for the media to get wind of it. [clears throat] But I have to admit, I don't remember her. Unfortunately, I remember her. She came with that man from the printing office. His name is... Cieślak. Isn't that right? [indistinct chatter] [woman singing sultry song in Polish] [continues singing] - [song ends] - [applause] Esteemed guests, it is my distinct pleasure to present to you my husband, and our future senator, Mr. Bruno Szeliga! [applause] Thank you, thank you, very much. YOUR CANDIDATE Thank you all for, um, for being here. Esteemed guests, I really wouldn't be here... [mic feedback screeching] Uh... I wouldn't be here at all if not for my wife. Thank you, honey. And you said that you "unfortunately" remember her. So, my question, why "unfortunately"? Hmm. "Unfortunately" because there were some very unpleasant circumstances. [Bruno clears throat] They had a fight. Cieślak and the woman. It was awful. - [Jason] What was it about? - I have no idea. Both were under the influence of alcohol, so I'm sure it was nothing important. [Jason] Your place is so beautiful! How much space! How bright! So much natural light! This is... never heard of in our Podkowa. Yeah. The citizens of Podkowa love their trees so much that they spend their whole lives in their shadows. Vitamin D. [gasps softly] What are you doing here? Should I arrest you for obstructing the case? - It's not what you think. - Don't tell me what I think. - I know what I'm thinking. - How do you do? Uh... I'm here for the dog. Uh-huh. - Mm-hmm. - It's a beautiful animal. Hmm. Pretty and smart. It's incredibly obedient. Well then, I envy you. Mine doesn't listen one bit. You know it's not the dog's fault. It's the owner's. Bruno. After you. [dog grunting] Huh? Bruno, doggy. Bruno, my little dog. It's important not to be afraid. A dog can sense it. [clippers snipping] [man] Hello. [suspenseful music playing] [phone beeps] I just used the emergency button and our location and photos were sent to the police. You can't kill me now, they've seen you. You forgot your change. Here you are. Oh, my God. Dummy. Enjoy your pizza. [police siren chirps] Do you know how long that took? Do you? For the dog? "Don't worry about anything." You told me I'd be safe and they could've murdered me so many times. - Somehow, they didn't. - And my pizza got cold. Besides, what could be more important than my life to you? First of all, I identified our victim. Second of all, her fiancé in my car. He's the main suspect and I'm taking him to the station. Who was she? You have to tell me. Joanna Maj. A hairdresser from Brwinów. You think he's the one who... [chokes] They had a fight. And we found his fingerprints. They were all over the murder weapon. Hmm. No, no, no. That doesn't seem right. If he did it, he would've wiped his prints. May I talk to him, please? Are you out of your mind? Yeah, but her only lead is Weronica's necklace and he might know where she got it from. Get your head straight! I won't let you talk to a murderer. And you can delete the emergency number, there is no more danger. I'm taking him to the station. - [phone ringing] - I'm sure. Shut up. Yes, sir. [mysterious music playing] Excuse me, sir. Can I please ask you... Your fiancée had the same one but with a "W." Remember? [Jason] Oh, now you've crossed the line. [Cieślak] She had never worn it before. We were leaving, but she couldn't find it. I begged her to wear something else. She had so many pendants. She wouldn't stop it. Said she wouldn't go out without that necklace. And would you happen to know where she found it? Why would I care? Yes, but why was it so important? Why did she care so much? I don't know. All I frigging know, I explained where we were going, and she started freaking out. [suspenseful music playing] WE HAVE POWER [music fades] Joanna's funeral is tomorrow in Żyrardów. Excuse me. Are you talking about Joanna Maj, the woman who was murdered? Did you know our little Joanna? She was just an acquaintance. Joanna Maj. She was employed here? [ringtone plays "The Pink Panther Theme"] [ringtone stops] Jason, the hairdresser says the fiancé couldn't have killed her! Is the hairdresser also leading the investigation? Maybe I'll cut hair. Why are you like this? Jesus Christ! I stopped smoking because of that Mazur guy. [laughs] It's not the fiancé. They had footage of him at the party. At the moment of the murder he was swimming in the pool. And the fingerprints? It was a skewer. Anyone could have touched it. Listen. I believe she put on that necklace intentionally because she wanted somebody to see it. Tomorrow is the funeral. I intend to be there. Come with me, maybe we'll find something. Come on. Chin up. Stop trying to cheer me up. I'm not cheering you up. I want to close the door. JOANNA MAY LIVED 35 YEARS [Jason] Stop grinning like that, it's a funeral. I know, but we might be close to solving this mystery. Look around and check if you can see anyone suspicious. I will. You should too. Henry... Could you help? - Me? - Yeah. Come on, help us. I won't forget this. [Jason grunts] Did you come by car or did you take a bus? - I drove here. - Can you take auntie with you? Where to? To the wake, honey. - After the funeral. - Yes. Yes. Anything for auntie. Excuse me. [indistinct chatter] Henry, pour us a drink. No, thank you, I don't drink. Because I'm driving. What do you mean? You won't toast to Joanna? No, no, my husband will drink for me. - Uh, you sure? - Jackie. Jackie, dear... Were you a friend of Joanna's? Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - Yes. - Yeah. - Yes. She was our... hairdresser. I mean, mine... she tragically didn't get to cut. Mine, tragically, didn't get to. Uh, do you think I could, uh, maybe use the toilet? Up the stairs. Drink, my friend. Not there. Ah. Excuse me. What are you doing in here? The girl in the photo... Her name was Weronica. Do you remember her? She was a friend of Joanna's. They were often together. - A friend of hers? - Yes. That's what I said, a friend. They were like sisters. They shared everything. Make-up, clothes, jewelry, shoes. Pendants. But there is no money or jewelry here. Nothing for you to steal, my dear. Yes, yes. Yes, of course. - I'll go, it's just a misunderstanding. - What misunderstanding? You're just a thief. - No, no, no, absolutely not. - Henry. - Do you know this lady? - Nah. I really don't mean to be disrespectful here. And it doesn't seem like anyone else knows them. They are thieves, I'm certain. [sniffling] [clangs] It's a misunderstanding, I promise. - [Jason] Dearest guests. - Oh, no. I'd like to propose a toast. A toast to our dearly departed victim. May she... may she live on! [slurring] Cheers! Jason! [groans] Thank you very much. Thank you very much for... for your time and... thank you for us. Thank you. Now I know why Joanna was wearing my necklace. Listen, she was friends with Weronica, get it? There was someone at that party from Weronica's past and Joanna knew about it. It's the reason she was killed. Our investigations are one and the same and it's clearly obvious what this mess is about. Joanna died because of Weronica. [sleepily] So nice... Jason! [suspenseful music playing] [Jason] Very nice people. [Magda] You know, we were supposed to never take them off. I felt remorse that I was a bad friend. That I wasn't, you know... [grunts] ...interested in her enough. What? Well, she had life. Elsewhere. A life without me. [Jason] Very nice people... My regards... Magda. I always thought that if it hadn't been for Weronika's disappearance, you and Tommy would have never married. What? You were like a wet patch. Until someone came along with a mop and sucked you up. h. He was just the first to come along. Sometimes I regret it wasn't Jason. [laughs] Jason... Poor guy. Jason was in love with... you know. I mean, everyone was in love with Weronika. That's the thing, not everyone. [Jason murmurs] [sweeping emotional music playing] Magda? Good morning. Hello, Magda. Good morning. Come in. I was sure you wouldn't come. Um, Ms. Wanda, I won't hide the fact that... there is a reason I wanted to see you. Yes? But you can come visit us anytime. I attended the murdered woman's funeral, Joanna Maj. It turns out she was friends with Weronica. [chuckles] Oh, let's not talk about that. But Ms. Wanda, don't you think we should? Let's please not talk about that. Weronica didn't have a good relationship with her father. They were always fighting, screaming and arguing. If he had found out... that she was pregnant... Do you see? With no husband. I can't believe she was pregnant. Yes. That Maj girl introduced her to that terrible man. To whom? He wouldn't stop coming to her, to the restaurant. But what was his name? What restaurant? Oh, the one at the racetrack. They used to work there as waitresses. Weronica knew wouldn't be able to defend her with her father. That's why she ran away. [dramatic music playing] [Magda] Hello. [car approaches] [ominous music playing] [train horn blows] [dog yapping] Oh... [yelps] - Ms. Magda. - Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - What are you doing? - [engine revs] That car is following me. You'll think I'm crazy. But, no, really. It's been following me for a couple days. - Well, then we need to call the police. - No, the police are asleep. Maybe you can just take me home? Yes, of course. Please take my number and call me in a situation like this. It'll be my emergency number. That's fine. [Thomas] I wonder what your excuse is this time. What are you doing with that pompous ass on his motorbike? I'm having an affair. I'm sorry. I'll prepare dinner in a moment. You don't have to. We're going out. Out where? It's a surprise. [soft jazz music playing] Thomas... I had a feeling... that I needed to pay you back somehow for... how well you've been taking care of our home, our children, and... I got you a little something. [Thomas chuckles] You're not opening it? Well... Go ahead, go ahead. Hmm. Oh, no, Magda, it's okay. It's okay. I'm also moved. - Thomas... - Hmm? I want to tell you how I feel but there's been a lot happening recently and... well, I've had a very difficult day, so... You're forgiven. [Czerwiński] Thomas. - Ah. - How about a dessert on me? Wonderful. You are just too kind with us. [Thomas humming] Almost done with breakfast? Mm-hmm. We'll let Mommy rest today. I'll take you guys to school. [groans] What's that supposed to mean? Let's go. Get in the car. [Thomas] What? Come on or you'll be late. Just don't get the car dirty. Mm, my favorite perfume. Get your things, we are leaving. [melancholy music playing] [Thomas] Don't put your feet on my seats. [engine starts] [emotional music playing] [music fades] - You wanted to talk to the owner? - Yes. Ilona Czerwińska. You are Jarosław Czerwiński wife? [scoffs] Ex-wife. She was a one-of-a-kind girl. She always received twice as much in tips as the others. Everyone loved that one. They both worked here together, right? The other one was a dirty slut. She went after my husband. Joanna, right? I can't remember all their names. Way too many. Could you take another look at her? Wasn't it Weronica? I'm sure he was not sleeping with her. This girl was a different story. It was more like true love. Well, my man was only sleeping around. But the other guy really fell in love. Badly. And she fell for him too. I think. Although, to be honest, when a guy has that much money, it's hard to say if it's about feelings or his wallet. You know who he was? Yes. Yes. They came here all the time. They ate, drank, bet on all the races. They even won a little bit. It was more like a... fairy tale. Maybe you can remember his name? Yes. Bruno Szeliga. [breathes shakily] Okay. [emotional music playing] - [metal gate clanks] - [crowd cheers] [music builds] [sweeping emotional music playing] [inaudible] [music fades] [indistinct chatter] Do you know I've never been to the races? [Magda] I think Weronica is dead. Today I... Today I saw them there. On the grandstand. I can feel it, Jason. You know what I discovered? Czerwiński was contributing campaign funds to Szeliga. And there are others waiting in line. It's serious. Weronika was pregnant with Szeliga's child. - What? - Yeah. A renowned businessman, respected philanthropist. Okay, but that doesn't mean she's dead. She was pregnant with a married man. You know how it is. He fell in love with a beautiful girl. An amazing love. But then it got complicated when she got pregnant. Maybe he sent her to Berlin or maybe Bali? And he's paying her to stay away. That was a possibility, but then Joanna died. And she knew everything. She came to the party where he was supposed to announce the start of his political career. So she wore the necklace belonging to Weronica. And they killed her. - She wanted to blackmail someone. - Not someone. Szeliga. You have to arrest him. That's not how it works. I'm not arresting someone without evidence. And Weronica? That's just a hypothesis. We don't even have a body. OPEN GARDENS FESTIVAL Sixty. Eighty. Ninety. Stop. Perfect. Ready to go. No, no, no, you must pay up at the front desk. Many thanks. You're turning water into spirits? No. - I'm energizing it to be more nutritional. - And costly. Everything needs to be in balance. [Magda] Those are the rules of the cosmos. Oh, you'll never let that go, will you? We've come to you with a very important matter. - Possibly need your expertise. - Pro bono. Pro publico bono. For Podkowa. Pro publico bono for Podkowa. You should have said so from the beginning. Hello, dear guests. It is with pleasure that my wife and I welcome you to our garden. With us is the illustrious mayor of Podkowa Leśna. Artur, would you do us the honor of inaugurating the festival? - Please. - Thank you. [applause] Good morning, guests. Welcome to another edition of Podkowa's Open Garden Festival. This is the 15th year in a row that you will open the gates to your gardens, and your hearts, to your neighbors. The main event today will be a concert with the opera singer Ewa Warta-Śmietana. Enjoy! [Bruno] Thank you, Artur. Bravo! [all cheering] [singing in Polish] [sings high notes] [chuckles] I'm begging you, Mr. Robert, try a little harder. I'm trying, I'm trying very hard indeed. I can't really tell. No, because it's the world of energies. - Not many people... - He's coming. The famous miracle worker and fortune teller in my humble garden. I see that you both know each other. Yes. Ms. Magda asked me to help her with a missing persons case from many years ago. [Magda] Yes. Fascinating. But you shouldn't be here. It's... - private property. - [Magda] Well... - But it's open to everyone today, no? - Of course. Of course. Excuse me, what's over there? The old part of the garden which we don't use anymore. So, please, come enjoy the concert. This spot has bad acoustics. [ominous music playing] [bird hooting] - Having trouble sleeping? - What are you doing here? This is private property. You seem nervous. It's just me. [owl hooting] None of you should be here. As it so happens, Mr. Szeliga, I'm looking for a body. [scoffs] Here? Do you have a warrant? Naturally. We just didn't know where to dig. It's interesting you're not even curious to know whose body. [sighs] Take him away. [owl hoots] [handcuffs click] Everything good with you? It is. Jason... I thought I could go in there with you. I can't permit you to interrogate a suspect. [Jason] Wouldn't it have been better to remember her like this? We know everything. The affair, the racetrack... the pregnancy. Have you ever been in love? [emotional music playing] [Bruno] Truly. Deeply. Completely. It was the weekend. My wife went out of town. So I invited Weronica to come over. We had a wonderful Saturday. On Sunday morning, Wera felt ill. I had no medicine or painkillers, so... [gasps] It was an accident. She fell down the stairs and hit her head. I can't remember after that. You don't remember burying her body in your garden? Nobody would've believed it was an accident, so... I buried her under the birch trees. Crying and praying that she'd forgive me. [Jason] And Joanna? The girl from the park. You also prayed that she'd forgive you? I didn't kill her. If you were more thorough, you'd know that. I didn't leave the party. Not even for a minute. [sobs] [melancholy music playing] [exhales shakily] Oh, hello. Hello. Are you done? With what? - With the interrogation. - Yeah. Yeah. That inspector is quite handsome. Maybe he'll arrest me. [giggles] The day after we found Weronica I also found out my husband has been cheating. And so? Breakfast or send him to hell? An injection. - What? - I have to run. Szeliga's dog needs a veterinarian. I don't believe it. [mysterious music playing] [Czerwiński] Where is my money? I gave Szeliga one million in cash for the campaign, but any electoral success seems to be out of the question now. I don't know anything about any money. Bruno didn't share those kinds of things. Are you saying my million is gone before the campaign even started? Did you not hear what I just said? It's not my business. - The finances were between you two. - [laughs] Don't make me laugh, Barbara. Everyone knows that in this house even a mouse can't shit without you knowing about it. Open the safe. Or I will be forced to do it my way. Yeah? And do you want to know who's responsible for this bullshit? - What? - It's your fault. If you hadn't introduced Bruno to that whore... You have no idea how humiliating all that was. I was trying to have a baby with Bruno for many years, and then she comes along and gets pregnant. I knew about their affair for a long time. Wanted to catch them together in bed, humiliate them. I pretended to leave. When I came back home... [ominous music playing] [gasps] You stupid whore. You think you can have all of this? Think you can take it all away from me? You whore. - I will kill you! - No, no! [dramatic music playing] - [grunts] - [yells] [dull thud] [Czerwiński] Unlike your husband, I never bought that story about a fall. Only now it's your husband who'll end up in jail, not you. If I hadn't come that day, you'd have killed him too. Give me back my money! And what about that poor girl in the park. She wanted to blackmail Bruno. I couldn't let that happen. [Joanna] Listen to me, you snake. I won't leave here... [woman singing sultry song in Polish] You want to tell everyone, huh? - Tell me! - I don't know what you're talking about. - Calm down. What are you doing? - I just want to talk to this man. Where is my friend? Tell me! Making a fool of me! - Tell me what you did to Weronica! - Come on. [Joanna] This slimy senator knows something. [arguing indistinctly] Will you get off my back? What the hell you want me to do about it? [continues singing] [ominous music playing] [train horn blows] [dramatic music playing] [gasps] [screams] It didn't occur to you that all these years I was keeping an eye on Bruno? Who do you think cleaned up the mess after Weronica? Did you think I was going to let that whore destroy him? Except I was planning to do it my way. Just like with the hobo. And you had to screw it all up. [ringtone plays "The Pink Panther Theme"] Good afternoon. I'm here for the puppy. [dramatic music playing] Oh, fuck! [dog barking] Get her! [whimpers] [man on radio] He's coming. Copy that. Over. Hey, boss. He's there. He who? Where? Szeliga, in the video from the party. He didn't do it. - [car horn honks] - [people cheering] WELCOME TO PODKOWA WE LOVE SHEIKH [speaking mock Arabic] ...Podkowa Leśna! [crowd continues cheering] [sheik] Thank you! I am very happy to hear. I am very happy to be here. Thank you! As-salaam alaikum. Shukran. Shukran. Shukran. Hi. Uh... As-salaam alaikum. Welcome in... Forest Horseshoe. Uh... shukran. Ah... Um... Uh... Uh... [clears throat] [speaking gibberish] [coughs] Oh, crap. [clears throat] [groans] It's impossible. I'm sorry. [sighs] I don't get it. Why? Because my business has been really slow. So I wanted to revitalize a failing brand. [Magda laughs] So you made up a phony sheik? Yeah. I don't get it. You've been a healer but you still cheat people as well? I am no healer, Ms. Magda. I'm just the former head of marketing at a big corporation and I simply wanted to kind of do something for myself. Yeah, but you're a healer. Ms. Magda. People heal themselves. I don't know. Maybe there is some positive energy or... faith. Faith can move mountains. But Jason stopped smoking. - Really? - Uh-huh. Placebo. When you came to me that time, asked me about your friend, about her disappearance. I really wanted to help you. It was impossible. How could I? How could I lie about something so difficult? It's a different thing to stop smoking. Very different. Please forgive me. Uh... In Szeligas' garden that day, tell me... you felt something, that place where we found Weronica. - Impossible! That's where the body was? - Yes. - Buried there! - Yes. - The wand started moving on its own! - Yes! That's because you have the gift and that was proof. - You really think? - Of course. You must believe in yourself. [both laugh] - Ugh. All right. I need to go. - You won't expose me? - No! - Thank you. [crowd cheering] Bye. [cell phone beeps] Who is a pretty dog, huh? Who? Beautiful. Beautiful. [cell phone chimes] Uh... The dog is completely healthy, but I have to go now because I have an emergency appointment. Uh, goodbye. See you next time. [cell phone chimes] Shit. [revs] [dramatic music playing] [revs] [Chinese folk music playing] Elka, Elka, Elka, Elka, Elka, Elka, Elka. There's a guy chasing me. Yeah? Is he cute? - Joanna's murderer. - Dance! That's him! [Elka] Fans! [whimpers] [gun cocks] In the car. ♪ Everybody was kung fu fighting ♪ [grunting] ♪ Those cats were fast as lightning ♪ ♪ In fact, it was A little bit frightening ♪ ♪ But they fought With expert timing ♪ [groans] [dancers cheering] ♪ They were chopping them up They were chopping them down ♪ [Czerwiński] Get out! Get out. Ow, ow, ow. - No. No. - [dog growling] [grunts] [door slams] [snarling] Get her! [police siren wailing] - [Jason] Magda, Magda! - [officer] Freeze! Police! [shushing] [dog snarls] [softly] Try to stay calm. Get up. Magda. Just stay calm. Don't be afraid. Get up. Magda, you know that dog, don't you? It's gonna be all right. Don't be afraid. You've done this before. [growling] [shakily] Good boy. Here. Come here. Good doggy. Good boy. [sighs] Good boy. Well, you two can now... get to know each other. [Jason] We already know each other. But... Let's do it again. Jason Sikora. Walczak. - Pleasure to meet you. - Hey. Whoo. I brought you something. [emotional music playing] Isn't that incriminating evidence? [chuckles] That's right. But they'll be accusing each other anyway. And I thought after everything that's happened, you deserved it. [sighs] Oh, Jason. You really aren't cut out to be a policeman. [both laugh] But you know what? No. This is no longer my story. But thank you very much. Do you want me to go in there and help you somehow? I need to enter that cage by myself. What's this? Are you going somewhere? Did I miss something again, Magda? That's your suitcase. Excuse me? I know it was for her that you bought that perfume. And when I found out, you bought the exact same one for me. - Magda, honey, what are you saying? - Look at it this way. Czerwiński is in jail. So Susie will need you to be her sugar daddy. I'm giving you your freedom. Okay. Thomas. It's not at all about the perfume. I'm fixing a mistake we both made 15 years ago. Magda, honey... What mistake?
