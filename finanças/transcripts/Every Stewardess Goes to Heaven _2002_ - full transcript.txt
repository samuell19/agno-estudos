I would have preferred to find out through a doctor. With that special way they have of saying things. The minimum indispensable truth. Without getting into details. But no. I found out the worst way. I looked into the sky, and she was no longer there. I thought you could have eye pressure. But no. I look here, check, and all I find is a pair of beautiful and healthy eyes. If the eyes are perfect, what shall I do? What do I do for a living? "Do I have to use my first urine of the morning? Not necessarily. The high sensitivity reactor allows urine testing at any hour of the day. What must I do if the test indicates I'm pregnant? Call your doctor. Can the result be doubfull? No." Hang on! Move over, mum! Move over! I probably told you that. I feel I have... something like a pink halo in my right eye... since I've been coming here. It's like an image that comes straight from the brain. From the brain. When I sit down here it disappears. You need to do two things: First, keep quiet, or your eye will move and second... close your eyes for a minute. Close your eyes, that's it. I feel it comes from the brain it's either the brain or psychological. Which is not the same, as you know, being a doctor. I'll try to live with this, I'll do what I can. Now, for instance, I don't feel that pink halo. Can I open my eyes now? Doctor? There's the money for the cleaning lady. 20, plus her fare. The nursery is sending someone over. They'll check on the cactus, the second one. There's no detergent, and no toilet paper. Don't answer the phone. May I bring a gentleman in? I'll clean up afterwards. Don't pretend to be a liberated woman, Mum. You embarrass me. Shall I fix up your house a bit? Perhaps some color... I mean it, don't hang anything on the walls... I don't want tapestries, nothing. I like living like this. I like my house, showering at the airport, eating on the plane... Other lifestyles are possible. Yes, yours, and that in decoration magazines. My life works fine for me. Is this the usual thing... or there's something else? Nothing you can help me with. Thanks anyway, for looking after the house. Bye. EVERY STEWARDESS GOES TO HEAVEN Now you will welcome us... and thank us for everything, for choosing you, for trusting our lives to your company, for eating the food out of those trays, fastening the seat belts. And for not asking ourselves during the flight "How come this machine that is heavier than air, floats in the air?" I always ask myself: "What are you thinking of when you pull those faces?" Where do you look when you don't look anywhere? What hides behind that mask, those perfect gestures right out of a flight attendants manual? Sorry, you can't leave packages on the seat, - I'II... - No! - I'll put it here. - Okay. Come. Camila's your name, right? Put your seat belt on. - Why didn't you want to put it up top? - Just because. - It fired your curiosity? - Yes. Why? Because I'm an insolent child and I want to know everything. I am a magician... A magician? And I stuff people inside decorated boxes. What kind of people? Insolent, meddlesome people. - Like me? - Yes. The lines showing the results are clear and well defined. In case the pregnancy hormone level is low, the color will be softer. However, it still shows a positive result. A positive result is final in all cases. Can we change places? Why should I change places with you? So I can see my dad, who works at the airport. He's a signalman, at the airport. Alright. Yes. Thanks. My dad has an airplane. He's building it slowly. From each plane arriving there, he steals a part. Isn't that dangerous? No... I don't think so. All he wants is to fly. To fly over the South Pole, reach the Malvinas Islands, some such feat. To get the world's attention. He wants to prove the system is vulnerable. That's my dad. I thought so. Hello, how are you? Hello, girls. Hello, sweetheart. Thanks a lot. I have a meeting with my mates, because of the threat. We are evaluating the possibility of a strike. Could you stay with her for a while? Anyway, you can't leave until the meeting is over. Thanks, I'll be right back. - It has nails in the wheels? - It's for the ice. You must be careful. Every winter many assholes get killed. Then they get used to it. - What do you mean? - The people, it's cyclical. When people die they take notice. By next winter they'll forget again. Brakes are essential. If in doubt, accelerate. Pump it... easy. Don't brake in a curve, you'll fuck up. Did you call your boyfriend? You are very curious. We are women. We tell each other women's things. No, it's not a boyfriend. I called a gentleman. - What did he say? - Nothing. I hung up on him. Then why did you call him? To find out if he was there. I don't get it why one year I pay 75 for a double room in winter... and now I'm paying 90 for a single. You should have brought your wife, you would have saved. Dial zero for room service. She can't. My wife is flying. This is for the TV. Breaking news. The operation of the Malvinas Argentinas airport is at risk. We have received an anonymous video, which we will now see. It is not a threat to our people but a warning to all those... Your wife flies? Yes. She'd better land. That's why we have formed the Southern Strategic Command and we demand that all activities cease immediately... Attention please. Airport authorities inform all passengers that all service at the Malvinas Argentinas airport is interrupted. We're going home. Dad's not working today. Thanks. What is it? I had to convince the authorities about the danger. Maria and "I'mcoming" took a bus. Maria got off in Plymouth. "I'mcoming", in Yourmouth. Maria and " Shoveitup " went to the hairdressers. Maria had her hair cut down to her waist... and " Shoveitup ", your ass. Maria and " Shoveitup " eat toasts. Maria eats them with jam... and " Shoveitup " with honey. These guys could never live on land. Can you imagine them taking the kids to school... signing their school reports? That's why I'm shacked up with a real estate broker. You should look for a land lover. Maria goes every now and then and "I'mcoming" all the time. Maria and "I'mcoming" went clothes shopping... If you have doubts or comments on the test, get in contact with us. Mom? Why did you answer? I told you not to answer. Yes, everything's okay. Yes, in Ushuaia. Yes, of course it's cold. No, I just wanted to... I wanted to know if... Did the plant guy go? Good. That's all. Bye, mom. Bye. This product is for single use. If you wish to repeat, you must use a new one. Is there any gynecologist on duty? This is the end of the world, darling. - How much is it? - Give me... eighty. Wait, your change. Here. Go see them. The girls know. ...when Ken finally found his own limits, his extraordinary willpower gave up and he fell into the abyss of white sleep. He started on the trip with no return: death. There he is! Stop, Jimmy! His body was frozen. We put him on the chopper and took him to the mountain medical center, led by Dr. Toni Muriaki and a team of specialists in hypothermia. "White death" starts with the contact of the feet with a frozen surface, and it comes in three stages: The first one appears after fourteen minutes. Ken would feel something like internal heat. This is known as the "paradoxical effect". Ken will start to feel sleepy and get carried away by sleep. Half an hour after the process starts, the heart stops. Cerebral activity continues a few more minutes, until neurons, frozen, collapse. I always tell those seeking advice: If you are looking for your own limits... this is a good place to find them. If you ever want to die, do it in snow. It's a sweet experience. Coming up, the incredible story of Helen, a deaf-mute girl trapped by tragedy in Pekin. Don't go away. Going anywhere in particular? Sonia's Club. Sonia. You don't like Sonia? I don't know Sonia but they say her show is good with girls from the capital. Sure. - Do you work there? - No. - I'm a stewardess. - Stewardess? You shouldn't have told me. I like guessing the fare's occupations. It's a little game I have, but I usually guess right. The world could end any minute so we mustn't waste time A wanderer at heart searching for freedom. I've been all over and I've found out where there's neither hatred nor war love becomes the king. I've lived a lot and I've come to the conclusion that when you are in love life is better down South. To really fall in love you must come down South. To really fall in love I'll go wherever you are. Without love you can't be happy. Without love life is hell. To really fall in love you must come down South. The thing is to go when it suits you. If you suffer, don't think it twice: Wait a while and fall in love again... Come in. Come here, sit down. Relax. Girls also come here. Most of them European. They have less prejudices, they are more fun. We also have couples. Sometimes boys and girls, sometimes boys and boys. Are you okay? Do you know the system here? It's 40 for a drink, 90 for my participation. 100 an hour. Anyway, it's different between girls. Do you want an hour? Pretty. What is it? Nice perfume. What is it? Let me guess. "Coc?." - Where are you from, Coc?? - From the capital. You have too many clothes on. What is it? Something else brings you here. You are pregnant. You want to get rid of it. I'm scared. Very scared. I'm cold. I'm tired. Me too. When I'm scared I feel like sleeping. Quite a coincidence, isn't it? Let's go, pal! You didn't like the room? Don't sleep with the heating on. Many die because of that. Who is she, mom? A friend. She's from work? No. She's pretty. Yes, she comes from far away. Good morning, Coc?. Had a good rest? Did you think it over? What are you going to do? Should I fix it for you? Make up your mind, I have people coming soon. Even though sea leopards, sea lions, and New Zealand and California seals... are believed to have retarded implantation, this has not been confirmed. Recently an Australian sea lion was detected... with a non implanted blastocyst. This would suggest that in this species implantation is retarded. The insufficient secretion of gonads hormones by the pituitary gland cause delays in the implantation. Here we are. - Here. - No, it's okay. Do I owe you anything? No, it's okay. If you ever come back, bring me a perfume. You get it cheaper, right? Coc?. - Thanks. - Good luck. - Miss... - Go away! - Miss, do you remember me? - No! I flew with you. I don't remember every face. But I do, and I remember your face very well. I wanted to ask you if you want... to drink something warm. Perhaps some chocolate. Why did you want to kill yourself? Kill myself? Are you crazy? You watch too much TV. You too. You know what? You remind me of someone. You look like the snowman. You also saw it? And why did you want to kill yourself? You do look suicidal. You have a fixation with me. I look suicidal, I look like the snowman. You fancy me. That's too obvious. You want to turn this into an excuse? How does this go on? We get married and have two children. If it's a boy we'll call him Ra?l, if it's a girl, Milagros. Why not Teresa? That's an old lady's name. My name is Teresa. Do I look that bad? No, I... - And how does this go on? - What? What am I going to say that you already know as it's obvious? You could tell me about a tragic past, to soften me. A death. That'd be great. Something melodramatic. A tactic to inspire pity first then sorrow, and then... And then love. Yes. I have something that might interest you. It's not in the books. It's like this: A doctor, a young man who had a good career met a stewardess, during a business trip, a very friendly, beautiful, nice girl. Their relationship grew and we... got married. And then the girl died. The guy, who had everything, who couldn't ask for more from life, has... to carry her ashes, her remains, in a box... to the butt of the world... to throw the stewardess' ashes into the Beagle Channel, where they first met, because he promised the girl he'd do that. How does it go on? That's when he kills himself because he can't bear the pain any longer. You didn't count on this one, this was unexpected. Not all of us are that obvious. The masculine world does include suffering every now and then. It's amazing that such assholes are in charge of a plane... - to carry us all over the place. - It is, indeed. Maria and "Shoveitup" went to buy dolls. Maria bought one with plaits and "Shoveitup" your ass. Maria and "Shoveitup" rode a taxi. Maria in the front seat and "Shoveitup" your back. Maria and "Shoveitup" went to the park. Maria got on the swing and "Shoveitup" all the way. Is it always like this? Do you think all pilots are like Saint Exupery? Land turns them mad. The one who wrote "The Little Prince". The boa that eats the elephant. Maria and Rubitin went to wash the windows. Maria washed the window and Rubitin your butt. The Airport Workers Union, which I chair, informs its members that the strike has been lifted. Our intelligence department has discovered that the despicable persons who have been bothering our community, as well as the civilians, are nothing but a bunch... of assholes without any operational capacity. That's why the Union has brought all of us together to elect between our beautiful women, the Queen of the South. Let the music begin! We have to go! Let's go! Come on. - Tonight my life will change. - Tonight, tonight. I don't want to be alone. No I don't. How many tears shed. How many kisses given away. He said it was my fault, that I trim his freedom down. I said: If you are not around, what shall I do? Always telling the truth is dangerous. If you have been in love, don't say it. I said: If you are not around, what shall I do? Always telling the truth is dangerous. This is why I'm having a party, but without you. Party, this is a fantastic party. Party, this is a fantastic party with friends, and without you. Tonight I'm happy, It's just what I wanted. He wasn't at all like him. Do you know why airplanes fly? There are many principles involved. If just one of them is violated the plane will crash. One of these principles, among the most important ones... is that you don't fuck around with the women on board. Womb, they don't have a womb. That's something the women on land have. They change shitty diapers. A coffee in the morning while staying in bed. Devotion, sacrifice, they are all mothers. But not them. Our girls are always leaving. The heating in your car broke down? You are weird. My feet are really cold. This never happened to me, it's terribly cold. And I have temperature. Well, I can go back to sleep. Come in, snowman. - Ken. - What? The snowman was called Ken. You can't fly tomorrow. Are you crazy? Why can't I? You need to rest. You have a nasty angina. How would you know? - Are you a specialist? - Yes, I am an ophthalmologist. I can check your eyes and also your throat. I'm a doctor. Look. There. - How many lights do you see? - One. - How many lights do you see? - One. - And now? - One. You are not well. You need... a... - What? - Treatment. What are you thinking about? The Indians. How they kept warm. What are you thinking about? Sorrow. Well... your sorrow. I can feel it too. I feel pity. And I like you. You. Hug me. Tighter, I can't feel you. Come on, sweetheart! Let me get Teresa. Fuck her for being a slut! Come. Don't get me wrong. I didn't mean that. She doesn't understand aeronautical humor. - You turned the alarm off, bastard! - No, I... Yes! Is it late? Late? Asshole! Prick! Teresa, I... Shut up, Julian. - I had it in my hand. - Shut up! I'm gone. - Teresa. - What? - If you leave, I'll kill myself. - Go ahead. Hey! What are you doing? This is not a cart track. Let's go. I missed the plane. I missed the plane! There's another one at midday. But I wanted that one. Every stewardess goes to Heaven. That land of gestures and pantomimes... stiff smiles and reheated trays. And I stay behind, alone again, in the white expanse. White must be the color of death. Dull, inane white. The white of nothing. Is this death? No. This is not death. This is Heaven, the heaven of stewardesses. It's a boy. Another one? They tell me I was half dead. I don't remember a thing, it's all white. Four months asleep, out of this world. I could write a book, Michael Landon like... or turn into a priest, the Lord's shepherd. But there is nothing I could tell about this time. It was like a silent siesta. Vacations in nothingness. This is roughly what I looked like. Are you going to stay here all your life? It's just a bed, not a breather. You can walk now. The thing is, I have nowhere to go. Nobody called from the bank? Didn't a Nancy call? My secretary. The credit card company. I work with three banks. No one called? Do you want tea? Yes. Sugar? You like being pampered. Before dying were you also like this? Yes. No, I can't on the phone. Personally. It's something personal. Come over. I'll cook something and we'll have dinner. See you then. Tomorrow? Call me tomorrow? Alright. Bye. Where are those men who fill the airplanes? Where do they go? With their wives, children and dogs? Where do the ones on land live? It could be anyone. All of them. Anyone who'd want to... and had a few minutes to listen to me. One grows fond of patients. You spend so much time with them... patients become relatives. The doctor says that not always patients must be told the truth. But with you, I can't. You've been Iying to me? A little. Someone came to see me. A woman. Just once, after the accident. But since she didn't come back we didn't want to worry you. You had enough problems. She was... These girls who work on airplanes, with her hands... A stewardess. That's it. A stewardess - expecting... - Expecting what? Expecting! - A... - Yes! - A pregnant stewardess? - Yes! Yes? Come here. Congratulations! I don't know where to find her. What about "Marcos"? Horrible. Remember your father's uncle. - The pawnbroker. He's still wanted. - Okay. "Anthony". Please, no. "Anthony". It sounds "nouveau riche". Why not "Tom?s"? It's more humane. - He made you a woman. - So? That's important. What about "Ra?l"? Ra?l? That's an old man's name. We're talking about a name for a baby. "Ra?l". - Who is Ra?l? - A gentleman. I didn't tell you about him? Are you also going to marry this one? Probably. We'll go to a Club Med on honeymoon. Not to Brazil, not again. We'll look for an apartment together. His children will stay home to sleep. You can also stay. You know your mother. Aren't you scared of starting again, knowing each other... and then... failing? - Doesn't have one. - What do you mean? - He doesn't have one. - He must have one. We are grown women. He must have one. Is it a miracle, a test tube child? See that couch? That's where I fucked up. A guy, one night... That's not a father. No, that's not a father. Leave it, we'll take care of that. Go away. Go away, will you? And stay warm, you are still not well. If I were in charge, I'd never let you go. Does anyone have glaucoma in your family? - I don't know. - Eye pressure. - Not that I know. - See a doctor. Nothing serious. Many people have it. - Thanks. - Thanks. Pharmacist? - Me? - Yes. No, I'm an ophthalmologist. - Ophthalmologist. - Yes. To me you looked like the pharmacist type. What does a pharmacist look like? It's my imagination. I look at you and think, pharmacist, ophthalmologist... here for work, on vacations, family... I came here desperate. Desperate, nice place to come in such a state. Any other reason? Do you have work here? Sure, I'm an ophthalmologist... I'm all booked up through August. August next year? This is already September. Almost Yom Kippur. Do you know what that is? Yeah... no. The day of forgiveness. We forgive each other. A day for your inner thoughts. Every day here is for reflection. I'd like to book an appointment with Dr. Juli?n Adenauer. What about Nancy? His secretary. Alright. Your attention, please. Last boarding call for flight 2626 for Comodoro Rivadavia and Buenos Aires. Hello! - You're not feeling well? - No. I fell asleep because I'm medicated - and feel drowsy. - Shall I take you to the hospital? No, I was already there. Come and eat with us. - No, I'm waiting for my flight. - Your attention please. All flights have been suspended until further notice. This is... the limit. Do you like crabs? I married a stewardess... the first time. She was... the kindest woman in the world. She was... so... so beautiful, so beautiful. The only thing is, she died... She died on me. I always come back to stewardesses. So I got... hooked on another stewardess. She is pregnant... She then... At that time I couldn't... I had a problem, I was in hospital. I know your girlfriend. Where from? Many places. Look. What is that? This is dad's stuff. Don't say a word, or he'll get mad. This is it. Sir! Do you want to see it inside? This has the best of everything. The landing gear of a Boeing. The flaps of a McDouglas and some stuff of the Concorde. How come? The Concorde came here for the Millenium. And the orange paint? Just in case you get stranded in the Pole. I promised Camila I'd take her to Antarctica. If this ever takes off. It needs to be orange in case you get lost there. Everything's white there, even the penguins. You mean it? You have children? No... Not yet... I hope... With children you need to have a code. Some dream, a hobby. I was middle aged by the time Camila was born. I'm not going to start listening to Ricky Martin. This thing about the plane is something between Camila and I. Only... if it ever gets off the ground... Just a while up there. Happiness will blot out everything else. Do you like Rafaela Carr?? No. What's up, partner? Do you need Union assistance? I've been at the airport... gone to the hospital, nothing. I've been all over town. - Where could he go? - I think I know. Men are so predictable. Hello. I have a question for you. Is it about cormorants, sea lions? - Sea leopards? - No. - It's about men and women. - No, that's somewhere else. Excuse me. Is this a chase? Is it the father? No. Why are we following him? Sorry, I don't mean to barge in, it's only we've been talking... and I know something about love. I had... like, a girlfriend... in Uruguay. It was problematic... Not the fact that she wasn't Jewish but the distance. I ended up here, a good place to forget. Will you join me? No, I'm a practising Jew. And it's tempting, but I have my limits. She was scared. She told me that she was pregnant... that she was seeking to get rid of the child. Are you sure she was already pregnant when she got here? Yes, just a little. A few weeks only. I asked her to stay and sleep at home. She was cold and tired. She was scared. The same happens to me. Do you want to sleep a bit? I'll wake you up. You don't look good. There is something I must do. Catch you later. Don't stay with the heating on. You are going to get killed. Please! Coc?! What are you doing here? What a coincidence! I saw a friend of yours today. Juli?n? Yes, he asked after you. What did you tell him, where is he? Easy, we just talked. You know my style. - We talked, like I did with you. - Let's go find him. Come. Where? Look at your belly! I love it, it's beautiful! Good for you! You did the right thing, you won't regret it. - You always smell good. - He's going to kill himself. How do you know? He always does it. Juli?n! You can't kill yourself! Yeah? Then give me a reason. Love. I don't know... us. Your baby. Now I believe I know what they think of when they pull those faces. I think I know that exact point in them when they look everywhere and nowhere. The thing is... every stewardess goes to Heaven. But there's always one who comes back... who leaves paradise and comes back to save us. The one belonging to us staying down here, frozen with sorrow, stuck on the earth. Nothing special, simple, necessary. A second chance. Starting over. Looking the other way perhaps. It is like a domestic love... between Heaven and Earth. Love is about starting. Love is about starting. If it takes you somewhere dark don't be afraid of darkness you never know if it's only love or something else. Love is about starting. Love is about starting. EVERY STEWARDESS GOES TO HEAVEN
