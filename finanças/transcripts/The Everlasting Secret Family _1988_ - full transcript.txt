-[INAUDIBLE] hot. -But we must also remember that the younger artists were being carried away by the fantastic imaginings of the [INAUDIBLE] artists. The ability of a culture to produce fantastic imaginations is one of the true mysteries of art. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Get your things. You won't be coming back today. All right, now where were we? -You understand what it's all about, then do you? -Of course. -Tell me then, what is it all about? Well? -Leave me alone. -Do you know how the man is? -No, would you like a drink? Do your drink alcohol? -Of course. -You do? And what do you drink? -Creme de menthe. -Creme de menthe? Where do you drink this creme de menthe? -At a friend's house. -What sort of friend? -Just a school friend. -Room service. Room service, this is room 909. We'd like a bottle of creme de menthe. 909. And some ice. No, that'll be all. Thank you. Shan't be long. I suggest while we're waiting that you have a bath. It'll help to relax you. How did you get that? -Rugby. Can we have the television on? -If you wish. MALE (ON TV): All come in under 75, and we're starting again with you, Valerie. VALERIE (ON TV): Uh, 68. MALE (ON TV): 68. Lorriane? LORRAINE (ON TV): 63. MALE (ON TV): 63. Ann? ANN (ON TV): 55. MALE (ON TV): 55. Robyn? ROBYN (ON TV): 65. MALE (ON TV): $65. All the bids are in and locked. And our price is $64. Lorraine, let's go! [APPLAUSE] Well, Lorraine, I'm glad that you're not buying out. I really am. That was, uh-- well, that's the way it goes. Lorraine, we are now going to [INAUDIBLE] something, which I think is probably a little more in your field. Let's have a look at our showcase. ANNOUNCER (ON TV): It's fashion wear. MALE (ON TV): You like that, Lorraine? LORRAINE (ON TV): Oh yeah. ANNOUNCER (ON TV): A [INAUDIBLE] in a sweet little girls style. The blue background is-- -We've all looked at Leonardo's earlier works. But it's in these latter works that he-- --great studies of natural forces, which create and destroy cosmos. Skies in torment, [INAUDIBLE], [INAUDIBLE] currents. Class, attention to the board, please. -The parliament of a small country, such as Australia clients state, lives and functions within the permission of the Army. And within the permission of the larger power to which it is a client state. -But I thought the Army had to be loyal to the government. -The Army is loyal to what it sees as the prevailing traditions and values of the country until-- -I find this stuff fascinating. -I shouldn't let you read secrets of state. -I wish you could say. -You've become insatiable. -This is the complete range in silk, sir. -Yes, there the ones he wants me to have. I want to try them on. -It isn't customary to try on underwear. But I suppose you are an exception. -Yes I am. And you, stop making annoying glances at him. -So you're the new boy, are you? -I'll wait in the car. [DOOR BELL] Eric, give me your glove. -Why? -Give it to me. -It's part of the uniform. -Give it to me. YOUTH (VOICEOVER): In that first uncertain but somehow strangely vaguely inevitable submission, when I was coaxed and cajoled into a way of living about which I only had an inkling, in that time my past from detachment, to pretended attachment, and then into moaning submission and a realization of the sun filled truth. What had happened was right. Right for me. Any -Messages? No, I'll get back to him tomorrow. Read the cable [INAUDIBLE]. Inland fisheries, it's a standing committee. Don't put it through the [INAUDIBLE], hide it in the office. [INAUDIBLE] important [INAUDIBLE] I carry with me. -Senator, where do you want these? -In the bedroom. Our recommendations weren't meant to go that far, they're a way of stealing that position from the opposition, no more. It's unfinished. Completely. Yes, we're here now. Oh, he's frowning about and expecting it all. He'll have to like it. No, there was no problem at that end at all. OK, I'll call you tomorrow. Fine. Bye. -It's my [INAUDIBLE] to understand or know yet. -But I want to know. -It's you're job to be-- to simply be, to be a pleasure. Or as the judge would say, you must live your role. -I don't understand. -At your age, there is no you. You are what people expect you to be. You are personified youthfulness. That is enough. -How do I be that and understand things as well? -It is a failing of the young that they do not appreciate their role. For them being young is [INAUDIBLE], they want always not to be young. You don't work here. -You're hurting me. -When something falls from the table you leave it. -Why? -Why? You fag. You fag. -I can't stand that Bach piece. I can't stand it again and again. -It's the look on his face when he plays that I can't stand. -Yeah. Oh, our hostess. -Shut up. -Have you heard? -Heard what? [CHUCKLING] Heard what? [SPEAKING JAPANESE] -But I don't like Japanese. -We all have to learn to like Japanese. Do you understand? We've talked about defiance before. Do I have to remind you of the consequences? -No you don't. -You give pleasure to Mr. Akutangana. We all know how good you can be at giving pleasure. Hey, don't we? Answer me properly. -Yes, sir. -Well, that's it for today. See you all next Thursday. Everyone, bring a favorite piece. -I'll come by in about an hour. -What is it you want? -I want to disappear for a couple of hours. -You know the rules. -Please? It's marvelous. -My grandfather started it. I've let it get slightly out of control. Occasionally I sell a cactus plant. -That's an [INAUDIBLE]. -Mm. There are many native plants and trees, so it's not uniquely Japanese anymore. My grandfather built a number of Japanese gardens all over Australia until it became unfashionable. -Now they're back in fashion. You must never repeat to anyone what I told you. -I won't tell a soul. -Have you ever played everywhere and nowhere? -No, I haven't. -I'll show you one day. -Don't you ever want to run away? -They'd find me. -You could go to another city. -You don't understand. -What don't I understand? -I don't want to go away. -There will be many challenges to our decision, I'm sure. -Well, [INAUDIBLE]. -Some don't. -It's all in a good cause. -Ladies. [BABIES CRYING] Ladies. And the good senator-- and may I say the handsome senator-- -Here, here. --will announce the winner of the competition. -I have heard many of the woman. But as always, these tasks are never easy. -I don't know how you put up with all of this. -It's all part of the job. You were quite right to get me down here. These sort of things count. -Well, as you know, the branch here is quite strong. -And in politics, you never know what it is that impresses people. You just do everything. -You're very accomplished from my observations. -You're not the gardener also? -Well, if I don't do it, no one will. Parliament resumes this week, doesn't it? -I'm afraid it does. -Would you mind telling my father that I'll be down later in the session? -I'd be glad to. -Thank you. Well, goodbye. -Goodbye. -Perhaps we'll see each other in the capital. -I'm sure we shall. Goodbye. [MUSIC PLAYING] -The [INAUDIBLE], as always, we know been a masculine flower. It's meaning in true origin has always been ecstasy, secrecy, and silence. And the thrown is also belongs with ecstasy. And I remind you, again, of the term sub-rosen and it's consequences. And I remind you, again, of the ceremony of vision [INAUDIBLE]. -But I already belong with someone. -I know, but I also have certain clients. -I don't know anything about that. -You've been inducted for sometime. I've watched you come forward, you've now reached the second degree. -Yes, sir. -I've seen you watching me. -I'm sorry, but I know I should go. -You have a special curiosity. -But I must leave. I can't go with you. -You're being correct. I admire you for that, but when you feel ready, you must come to me. Go now. -Nothing, I repeat, nothing is as effective as shaking a person's hand. Anther thing, make a note of all the party faithful that I don't get to meet at the reception and send each of them a telegram expressing my regret that I didn't get to talk to them. You might also consider contacting their wives or sending them-- Eric, the school is the next turn on the left. And you go to the [INAUDIBLE] and stay there. TEACHER: Put up your hands, to those of you who know what the starts on our flag stand for. All of you? That's very good. Thank you, you can put them down now. Now, I'm going to tell you a little about the history of the stars on our flag. I hope you all know the difference between stars in the sky, stars in the movies, and stars in your eyes. [LAUGHING] Does anyone know the difference? Yes, yes, you do? And you do? Will you come out here and tell us? Thank you. Now, before I give you this, you have to tell me what is the difference between stars in your eyes and stars in the sky. -Do you fancy me, Eric? I think you do. -Cut that out. -Do you think I fancy you? I'm in fantastic shape. Don't you think so? Come over here and let's fool about. Eric, come on, I know you want it. I feel very loose. Come on, take me. -Just shut up and get ready. We'll be going to dinner. -You wouldn't dare touch my body, would you, Eric? Because he'd have killed. I like the idea. Not of you being dead, but the idea that he'd have you done away with if you even laid a finger on me. I'm having fresh shower. -Excuse me, [INAUDIBLE]. -Senator. -You were good today with the children at the school, senator. -Thank you. -Senator, we have to make some time for a foundation [INAUDIBLE] and a garden party. -Leave a little bit of time for some fun. -I will, Mr. Mayor. Just put it down on paper. I can't hold dates and times in my head. Hello, you're a long way from home. -I heard you were campaigning over this way so I drove across from [INAUDIBLE]. Good afternoon to you, my good mayor. -Good afternoon to you, my dear. Good of you to join us. You're obviously pulling the women's vote. Well, one good woman's vote. -That's quite a drive from your place. -I'm used to the drive. I was hoping though that you would have time to join me for dinner. -Now don't go prying away from [INAUDIBLE]. -I'm sure the campaign can spare me for one meal. -But as you all realize, I'm sure, I am part of the campaign. -Would you care for sherry? -I don't think so. Thanks. -Shall we go? -You do have an 8:00 AM breakfast, senator. -Yes. -I see you have your work cut out. -You haven't told me who he is. -He's a high court judge. -I've never had a high court judge. Let's go out and eat. -I'm waiting to see if I'm needed tonight. It's your move. -Were you really a lover, Eric? -Is that so hard to believe? -Maybe, maybe not. -Now I'm a chauffeur, and a doer of dirty work. -I'm not going to let that happen to me. -You know you're only to drink when you're with him. Oh, come on, come on, put it back. Been in enough trouble this month already. -I'm not going to let it happen to me. -What? You're not going to grow old? Tell me, how you going to avoid that? When you grow old you'll end up a chauffeur like me. Or a cook or a fag. -We'll see. -You will. -I don't believe you were ever a lover, Eric. -No, what you mean is, you don't believe you'll ever grow old, ugly. -Shut up! -Fat and ugly. -You're only trying to frighten me. And stop smirking! -You can't accept the fact you're just like all the rest of us. -Shut up! -Oh, there are scarier things than that ahead of you, beleive me. -Get out and go to your own room! -Oh, now, now. -What's going on here? Stop that horsing around. -Who is that woman in the car? Who is she? -If you ask a little more politely you might get an answer. -Who is the woman in the car? -A political friend. Eric, we won't need the car. -I want to come as well. -You are not coming. Calm down. -I am. Calm down. -I am. -I am. -Come on now. -I am. -Come on now. -Who's the boy? -Friend of Eric's. -A friend of Eric's? -He came for the scenery. -Well, how do you think it's going there? -He states that if, even before or after the purchase or acquisition, described promptly by the taxpayer. And agreement or arrangement, as a result of [INAUDIBLE] has [INAUDIBLE] a reasonably extended to be a substantial deduction in value [INAUDIBLE], The commissioner shall [INAUDIBLE] his agreement and arrangement [INAUDIBLE]. -Am I very good at things? Am I good in bed? -Annoying question at this time and this place. Sometimes. -When? -I won't tell you when. Pick them up. Pick them up. Now, what is this all about? -I want you to talk to me. -About what? -About everything. -About everything? [CHUCKLES] Thank you. Go out to the car. -I'm pleased you've come. Thank you. That'll be all, thank you. -Yes, your honor. -Well, the last time I spoke to you, you were determined not to come. I saw you in court the other day. There was a tedious not in the case. Does the senator know that you're here? -No. -What about his [INAUDIBLE]? -No. I gave him the slip. -Mm. You're very beautiful. Who did that to you? What made you change your mind? -Is there a book about us? About it all? -No. There is no one book. There are the manual, but there is no real book. -Can I see the manual? The books? -Of course. And I want the name of a doctor. -A doctor? What do you need a doctor? -I need a doctor to help me stay young. -Young? But you are young. You are so young. -Do you have the name of this sort of doctor? -Why? -It's very important that I stay young. -Being old, you can have power too, you know? -Would you have stayed younger longer if you could have? -Yes, I suppose I would. But medically it's too risky. -If you do not give me the name of the doctor, you cannot have me. -Yes. I will give you the name of the doctor if it will allay your fears. But be careful. Anyway, enough of that. Come to me, my beautiful boy. -Give me the name of the doctor first. -I had hoped that you would come to me with less mercenary reasons. -I don't want him to be one of us. -Oh no. He's the best in the field. -I did come for other reasons. -I'm glad. -Interested in roses? -Adah, what brings you to the capital? -Looking in on Father. Oh, and there's an exhibition I want to see. -The one at the university? -That's right. -Look at that. The rose is a complete picture, it's fully formal, but when you look at its part you see that they're all casual, informal. -Why don't you come along if you can spare the time. -I shall certainly make the time. -Uh oh, you're still looking for the book, aren't you? -The book isn't here, is it? -Nature teaches the body. Ah. Well, not too good. -You found the book hidden? -Yes, it was him. -It obviously comes from the judge. -Correct. -Well, you can't watch him every minute of the day. Not now, not at his age. It's a damn nascence. Maybe worse than useless. -Well, the judge is vulnerable. -How so? -Well, from my observations the youth's insatiable. -Put the book back where you found it. We don't want to alert him. Give him a little rope. Remember I have other preoccupations at present. -Yes, minister. -Eventually, of course, we'll have to do something. It's quite all right to drink from the can, Eric. Everyone drinks from the can in the United States. How do you like it? -I think I would prefer to have it from a glass, sir. I'm probably a little conservative. -How much would you pay me for doing it just once? -A great deal. -You would? -We've established what you are. What we're talking about now is the price. -(SIGHING) Anyway, today it's free. -Thank you. -Here, you'll like this. -Oh God, yes. -Yes. You like that all right? [GROAN] -No, take it away. Take it, please. In there. In there, please! [MOANING IN PAIN] -Here. Please, don't die. -I've got to go. I'm sorry, sir. I won't be long, darling, I hope. Is this a direct line? -It is, sir. -Would you leave us alone, thank you? -Oh course. -Now, tell me again. -He's dead. -And you were with him? -Yes, I was with him when he died. -Did anyone see you with the judge? -No. -You wouldn't know. It sounds as if you could have killed him. You go home, I'll find Eric. Have a key to his place? Take a taxi home. I actually do have to go, I'm afraid. You'll have to hold the fort down. Take OK yeah? I'm sorry, darling. -It's OK. -And look around for anything -Sorry about all this. -You can't be everywhere at once, Eric. His dying has avoided a difficult situation for us. We would eventually of had to do something. -He was my only chance. I killed him. Are you listening to me? I killed him! -Don't talk like that. Let me get you a drink. -Creme de menthe. Do you have any? -Creme de menthe, are you sure that's what you want? -Yes. -Won't they be looking for you? -I'll go away. I'll go to Honolulu where Peter went. -You're [INAUDIBLE]. -I'll go on the streets. -Shh. Don't talk like that. -I killed him because I was too young for him. -That's nonsense. He died because he was old. -What would you know about it? -Come up to my bed. Let me comfort you. -It's in all the papers. It says he was the most significant figure in politics during the 50's outside parliament. They say he was the [INAUDIBLE]. -Does it say anything about how he died? -No. So obviously there were no suspicious circumstances. -Good. -Good. -The funeral -The funeral -You'll have to go back. -I'm not going back. -Where will you go? -Honolulu. -I really don't think that's feasible. [DOOR BELL] I telephoned. That'll be them now. -Is he all right? -A little distraught. -Could you give me a minute, please? -I'll wait in the car. Thanks for calling. -Tell me, are you one of them? You did right. -And you say the judge told to come to me? -Yes. He said you'd help me. That you specialize in this sort of thing. -But you're so young. -But I want to stay young. -Growing old is not so bad. -I want to stay young. [SIGH] -Get undressed and get onto the table. -Will you help me? -Let's look at you first. We can do a lot to prevent aging. We can, uh-- we can keep organs and tissue young but there are some neurological and behavioral questions. It would be-- it would be highly experimental. -Experiment on me. You think my bum has dropped? Do you think my bum has dropped? -Your bum? -Something wrong? -Go put on some trousers, I have something to talk to you about. There is to be a change in our lives. There is a new phrase about to begin. -As you know, I'm willing to try anything. -Be serious. -Well, what is it? -I'm now required to marry. Consequently, I will not be living here. -You're going to marry that woman? -It is a new phase. -It's because I'm too old. -Too old? Don't be ridiculous. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You should try to take better care of yourself and keep this place a little cleaner. YOUTH: Don't clean in here. You know I can't stand the noise. Do it when I'm not here! -When did you last go out? -I said take it to the other room. -We've all been through this. We've all had out moment of glory and seen it pass. -Shut up! YOUTH (VOICEOVER): Through I had been used like a rare pedigreed cat, taken up when he wanted to hold and stroke and use of pulsing life. For most of the time I had been left adrift, lonely, restlessly, brutingly about the apartment. To look at him in public places and on television news and to yern for him, and to fear my fate. -You. -What's the matter with you? -I've been vomiting. I feel really retched. I feel retched. Bastard. But you're not coming back? You're not coming back. -I will visit you and you'll have a new role. -But I'll still belong to you? -Yes. [DOOR BELL] That'll be the babysitter. I'll get it. You have met? -Oh yes. We had a chat about the arrangements. Uh, there's a quiche [INAUDIBLE] in the refrigerator if you get hungry. -We better hurry. -Uh, you have the telephone numbers where we can be contacted? -Yes. -Well, good night. -Yes, good night. -He's a young friend of yours, Eric? -Yes, ma'am. -Well, does he live at home with his parents? -No, he's got student digs. -And what is he a student of? -He's doing course in pottery. -He's the artistic type? -Yes, I suppose you could say that. -And do you know him very well, dear? -I have met him through Eric. He's very reliable, would you say, Eric? -Oh yeah, certainly. Yes, very reliable. -Well, I dare say he is. I'm surrounded by reliable men. Of course, his hair-- his hair was styled exactly like mine. Oh, didn't you notice that? -A slight similarity, yes. -A slight? I'd say exactly my hair style. -Uh, excuse me, ma'am, minister, we're here now. Would you like me to driving you around the block, ma'am, while you check your appearance? -No. Thank you. -Senator! Senator! [INAUDIBLE]. -Senator, we'd like a story. -I'm sure you would. YOUTH (VOICEOVER): During the time that I served their son, gave to him my youth, guided him, watched over him, I created a plan and a dream against her and against the family. A strategy for my destiny. My very own vision for their boy, my prince. -This [INAUDIBLE] has done all it can do, I'm afraid. You can get down now. -You're not going to stop. -Are your muscles any pain? -You're not going to stop after all this time? -You will continue with the D5, but there is not much more we can do. The next stage would be cosmetic surgery. -I still look like a boy. -But as I told you all along, this could rebound on you at some stage. -How is the back pain, sir? -Oh, OK. Thanks, Eric. -Would you like something to eat, drink? -I thought you were suppose to be driving Madame today, Eric. We seem to have an overlap of duties. How was it? -Oh, you know, flies, dust, bush, the trees. -Eric, take the silly hat. How I hated that hat. I'll drive you in my car. Take you for a decent meal after all the scout cooking. -I need it. -What would you feel like? -I'll let you surprise me. -I thought he was no longer part of your entourage. -Is this the painting which caused the uproar? They're always committees which wish to tell the artist what to do. -I don't know, next year I might organize an exhibition painted by a committee. [CHUCKLING] -Now here's one I haven't seen before. They have become good friends. -Good is not the word I would choose. -I should play it very carefully if I were you. -I do have some tricks left. -[INAUDIBLE]? You show good taste, Eric. -It's about your son, sir. -What about my son? -I've been with you now 22 years. That's a long time, sir. -And you've been loyal more. You've been outstanding, Eric. We've shown our appreciation I hope. -Yes, sir. -But you would like something? Where does my son come into this? Now hold on, Eric. I hope, for both our sakes, that two things are not being canvassed here. The first it unspeakable and the second is undiscussable. If you're here to tell me that a certain thing has happened then you're in deep, deep trouble, as you well know, and you have crossed a serious line! If you have a proposal concerning the future of my son and the family then you are out of line and the matter is not open to discussion. Plans have been made and they do not include you. -I see. May I ask-- -You may not ask. But I will tell you, because you're so close to us all. Yes, it does involve him. They are both very close and it is part of the plan, even if he does not it himself. Is that clear, Eric? Is that clear? -No, it's not clear. I don't understand why not. I'm senior, I've given good service. I deserve it. -You deserve nothing. Nothing more than you've received. -I want him. I deserve to be something more than the chauffeur. -You are a chauffeur. And you will remain a chauffeur. -I was a lover once. -Eric, listen to me. You will remain what you are. Is that clear? Now, I suggest you leave. -I told you it's impossible to study on a beach. It's one of the great Australian myths. -You know everything. I wish we brought the radio. -No, we didn't bring the radio because you claimed you were going to study. -Well, if you knew it was one of the great Australian myths why'd you go along with it? You could have brought the radio and we'd both be happy. I'm going in to freshen up. And then I'll be 10 pages, you'll see. I'm going to disprove the great Australian myth. -Tell me, does Eric hang around too much? -How do you mean hang around me? -I mean does he hang around you? And you know perfectly well what I mean. -He might, but that's his job, to look after me. -His job is to drive you. It's my job to look after you. -She's jealous, is she? Let's go home and play with the computer. Let's almost study. -You do your 10 pages. [SIGH] Am I burning? -A little. I'll rub some oil in. -Please. You know, don't you, what would happen to Eric if he ever stepped out of line, hm? -I thought I should-- well, we've know each other for some time. We've come to be close. We are what'd you call close, aren't we? -I still think that maybe we shouldn't be doing this. You know, the rules and all. -Ah, I think I'm entitled. No-- we're entitled. -You mean you didn't clear this with my father? -Well, of course I did. -I hope you did. For your sake. What an incredible place. -That's a Crusader sword. And this is a Samaria sword. You can come around and spend some more time looking at them if you like. -She's got a wonderful collection. -Sorry, I've had a few glasses of champagne. -(CHUCKLING) We all have. -Have you ever slept in a four person bed? It's Dutch. I picked it up in [INAUDIBLE]. -It's sort of-- it's like another room. -It's very cozy and secure in there. The canopy was to stop the bags falling on you from the ceiling. And the curtains were to stop prying eyes. Climb in and try it. It's very safe in there. It's like a secret place. -Satin sheets. They feel terrific. -They're wonderful against your skin. -My mother always says satin sheets are degenerate. -You're mother's probably right. Take off your clothes and feel the satin against your body. That's it, don't be a scaredy cat. Take them off. You feel very safe in here, don't you? Let's get Eric in here and we'll play around. -You both planned this. Leave me alone. Get dressed, Eric, and take me home. You should not have done this. -Now, calm down. Well, nothing wrong's happened. Just having fun. -It was a fantasy. Everything's OK. -Take me home. -You mustn't mention this. We'll just pretend it all didn't happen. -Can't do that. I have to tell my father. -I'll be in serious trouble. -I expect you will. -We'll leave it for a day or so. Well, think about it, we've known each other ever since you were a little kid. Please. -I have to speak with you. -Go ahead. -Our son is well past puberty. -Yes. -And he does not require a babysitter. -As an only child he needs a companion. -I have never considered that a healthy relationship. How old is he? He seems unnaturally young. -I see no harm in it. -I've never considered him to be a savory person. You know that. -That's a little harsh. -Whatever else goes on, I want that person out of the house. -I suggest you ask our son what he wants. -I run these things. -Why then are you seeking my approval? -Because he is your lover. And it was more a forwarding to you than a seeking of your approval. -I suggest you leave things as they are. -I have no intention of leaving things as they are. [DOG BARKING] It's a little silly, that's all, to have a much older person with you so much. -But I like him. He's more-- he's like those tutors that people used to have. He's like a brother. More than a brother. -He is not a brother, nor is he a friend. He's a paid employee. He's not qualified as a tutor. As the brightest boy in your school, you hardly need a tutor. -I want him around. -Now come on, you're too old for a babysitter. -I suppose I like him. -I was thinking, and I have discussed this with you father, that the money we pay him at present could become part of your personal budget. -You mean the money would be mine to spend? -Of course, in a responsible way. -Could I continue to see him just as a friend? -Well, he would be an ex-employee. You cant very well have an ex-employee as a friend. -I couldn't see him at all? -Well, you have other friends. -Who? -Well, me, for one. [INAUDIBLE], you old friend. Oh come on, it's not that bad. It's part of growing up. You must admit, the money would be useful to you. You didn't give me an answer. -About what? -Am I your friend? Well? -But you're my mother. -Well, can't a mother be a friend? And he stated that he did not wish the relationship to continue. -He said that? -This is what he said, yes. He feels that it is finished. Now, I want your house key. In this envelope is a generous severance allowance. -I want to hear is from his own mouth. -Would you come down to the kitchen? SON (ON INTERCOM): Right now? -Yes, now. I trust that after this you'll make no effort to contact him. Tell him what you told me last night. -Did you? -Well, tell him. Let's get this thing over with. -I'm sorry that I said it. -And you don't wish to see me again? -That's what I said. -And so that's how it is to be? -No. I mean, I do want to see you again. I will see you again. What I said last night was untrue. -You cannot retract! -I don't want the money, I want him. If you don't let me I'll leave home and live with him. It will be the same as before. [BIRD CHIRPING] [GUN SHOT] Why shoot them? -Human willfulness. -I don't see the point. -It's pointless, that's the point. Yes, you could shoot me and nothing happen to me. That's right. -The rose, as we know, has always been a masculine flower. We learn this from the Persians. It's meaning in true origin has always been ecstasy, secrecy, and silence. And the thorn completes it's symbolism. For the thorn always belongs with ecstasy. Step forward, please. Ecstasy, secrecy, and silence. And the thorn completes this symbolism, for there can be no ecstasy without the thorn. Ecstasy, secrecy, and silence. And the thorn completes the symbolism, for there can be no ecstasy without the thorn. -Show me your chain. -Ecstasy secrecy-- -It's different. -There are different role. -This is our card. Take the card. -They're lovers. -Take that card. And that card is your card. The page of wands. I'm a magician and you are my wand. And this one is my card. The ace of clubs. -Incredible. You are a magician and my cup. [KNOCK ON DOOR] SENATOR: I looked in to say goodnight. -Come in. I am coming to accept what is happening with our son and the direction in which he is going. I want you to know, however, that I wish to be told nothing. We will continue as public man and wife. -And about his birthday? -I intend to organize a party as I've always done. -Good night. -Good night. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HAPPY BIRTHDAY PLAYING ON PIANO] -Happy birthday. -Thank you very much. -Happy birthday. -Thank you. -Happy birthday. -To us. If I could grant your wishes, what would that be? Do you have wishes like that? -First-- I know what my first wish is. -What? -No, I'll tell you my first wish last. -All right. And what's your second wish? -I'd like to go to Captain Scott's cabin in Antarctica and sleep there for a night. You know, it's exactly as it was when he was there 80 years ago. It's all there, just as he left it when he died. His newspapers, books, his pipe, and all his food and stuff, all preserved there by the cold. -And you want to go there? -I want to see all that stuff and sleep there for a night. -Well, that's all possible. What's your next wish? -Uh, to go to the [INAUDIBLE] where that battle was when all those Australians died. And to go to that underground headquarters the was found, skeletons sitting around, marks on the wall. And all that just as it was. -I've never heard of that. -It's there. My father knows about it. It's secret. -You have a delicious mind. -Do you think these things could happen? -We will both do all these things. -Are you sure? -Of course I'm sure. You shall have them, and I will go with you. -I want you to come. -You haven't told me your first wish. -My first wish-- I'm sure you know what it is. -Tell me. [WHISPERING] YOUTH (VOICEOVER): I could that I had a father and I had a son as lovers now. A lord and a prince. We were repositioned in life. I could not help enjoying the cheap novelty of it, as is my nature. But this was no cheap novelty. This was a new place for me in the arrangement of the things. We were another family now of a special kind within the everlasting secret family, with it's long oh so vulnerable history. I had played a trick with it, and I have played a trick with time. And I, and not the family, had caused this to come about. I had found a place, a roll, a ranking which had no name. Was without preordained destiny. And had within it endless dark possibilities.
