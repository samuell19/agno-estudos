Perfect, got it, thank you. - You, okay? - Yeah. - Fine. - Good. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Oh. Thank you. Congratulations, Helen. Right now, just kinda do this, actually. Hey, sis. Good thing you locked him down. Will you give him a break? It's his wedding day. Also, give me a break. It's my wedding day. Ah, y-you know, I can't do that, 'cause, like, I don't think he's right for you at all, and neither does Jake so... - What? - Who? Who? Jake, my best friend since the eighth grade. - A-Are you having a stroke? - No. Just, my back was turned. I didn't see him. Hi, Jake, how are you? I'm good, yeah, good. Y-You look... great. Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you. Uh, Duncan, I appreciate what you're doing, this whole brother, sister protective thing, but it's not necessary, okay? Mike and I have been together for a long time. We're married now, okay? Today we are married and we're gonna be fine, and I'm gonna be fine. So, thank you, but I do have a tad more life experience than you do. Okay, well, we're not that much younger than you, Helen. We have enough life experience to know when we're making a huge... - Not again. All right. - Man down! - Wow! That was... What a move. - Hey. - You okay? - You okay? - I'll help you up. - Thanks. It was mistake, that was the word. That was it. ♪ Move back by those tracks ♪ ♪ I move slowly, slowly ♪ ♪ You won't show me... ♪ Duncan? Duncan! ♪ Do me like that... ♪ Has anyone seen the host of this party?

He's house sitting for me this weekend. What about... What about Duncan? Have you seen him? What? Have you seen Duncan? He's house sitting and I have to give him my keys. I'm sorry, I can't hear a word you're saying. 'Cause the music's too loud. Who plays music this loud? Right, okay. Uh, do you want to go outside? Fine, yeah. I'll be able to hear you outside. I didn't expect to see you. Yeah, I had to drop off my keys with my idiot brother. Oh, he walked down to the river about 30 minutes ago with his girlfriend. Girlfriend? Uh, her name's Molly. She's really nice, you'd like her. - Ugh, Mike. - You still talking to him? He calls me a lot. I think he forgets we're divorced. Okay, uh... Hey, why don't you stay for a drink? Oh, no, I'm leaving town tomorrow. Come on. It's... It's early. - No, I wanna go home and pack. - Yeah. You know, I remember you used to be so much fun. Excuse me? What does that mean? I'm still fun. No, I didn't mean it like that. I'm so much fun, you wouldn't even be able to comprehend it. Anyway, will you, um, give my keys to Duncan? He's supposed to house sit for me while I'm gone. Although, who knows if he even remembers. He will. He'll take care of it. Just like how he took care of Pickles? Well, that was not his fault. He ran over Pickles with his car. Was that Pickles's fault? That dog lived for, like, ten more years after that. - That's not the point. - It's good to see you, Helen. Good to see you. But you might want to tell that best friend of yours that he sucks. I sure won't. - Hey oh. - Hey, did Jake give you my keys? Oh, yeah. Sorry, sorry, sorry about last night. Coffee? Oh, great. - Two sugars, no cream. - Thank you. Yeah, I... I'm not taking sugar right now, but thank you. Oh, are you not? You're not taking sugar right now? I'm trying to cut down on sugar. You ready to get into the great wide open, paint with all the colors of the wind? You know, if you see a bear, I've seen all these bear documentaries. You can go up and rub their tummies. They love that. Great, I will file that away. Um, please don't burn down my house while I'm gone. And don't touch the succulents. They don't need watering. Those look very crusty. They're always dry. This is a list of items I'd like you to take care of. Just follow the list. Everything you need is on there. Okay, this is... This is like a serial killer. You laminated it. You have a lamination machine? Please don't do anything stupid. You ever think you're gonna stop giving me a hard time? Do something right, and I will stop giving you a hard time. Okay? Oh, that's... That's it. That's the key. - It's time to grow up. You're 35. - Figured it out. You know, I do things right. I'm an adult. I'm a grown man. - Yeah. - Uh-huh. Technically. You're gonna have, like, the most amazing time of your life. You're gonna get all the badges, make lots of friends. - This is an adult camping trip. - Yes. It's not camp. Yes, archery badge. - No archery, no. - Okay. Have fun. - Thanks, Duncan. - Gonna be fine. Thank you. - I'm responsible. Or something. - Yeah, I... - Bye. - Bye!

You know I can never find space junk. Well, you gotta look closer, at the big picture. No. No. That's why they call it the big picture. You're not supposed to look too closely at it. - How do you feel? - Hm. Same. No. You're here, so you're better. That's true. Everything is done? Yep. Everything is signed, sealed and delivered. And I haven't seen him in over a year, but now that it's official, I feel sad all over again. - You know what I mean? - Hm. Actually, I don't. Your grandfather died. He didn't give me the option of divorce, the jerk. But you're still gonna go on this crazy hike? You're not worried? No. Why would I be worried? I've never gone camping in my life.

Cool, that sounds fun. Listen, now that we're finally divorced, I realize th-th-that we got married, but I wasn't married. - I wasn't in the marriage, you know? - Yeah. I... I... Uh, yes, I know that. And-and I feel like now, I know how to be married. Hey Mike, I'm gonna go, okay? I gotta get off the phone. I'll call you when I'm back from my trip, okay? - So I'll talk to you when you get back. - Bye, Mike. Okay, be care... I do not have a hair dryer in this room. Oh, that's in, um, room number 16. You want that one? I don't want a different room, I just want a hair dryer. It's attached to the wall, so you can't take it off. Hi. Are you going on this hike with BSC? Thank God! Another old person! I thought I was the only one! It's a bunch of disgusting young people with young bodies and young minds. Ugh. Good news is, we have each other. Bad news is, we have each other. I'm Hugh. I'm Helen. I know I don't look like a Hugh. My dad named me after Hugh Hefner. He thought I was gonna grow up to be a ladies man. Hello? He's dead now. Hugh Hefner, not my father. He's in Calabasas. He is. Well, I'm off to find my bed in this motel. This is such a horrible experience already, right? All right, Lulu, thanks for nothin'. Oh! Don't get murdered tonight, Helen. We've gotta start tomorrow. I'm worried about all the smoke behind you. Oh, no, this is just my vibe. Yeah, I like, like, uh, spooky season kind of stuff, you know, like pumpkin spice. Kinda my thing. Oh, really? I actually had mono in the room that you're staying in, right here. Oh, thank you so much. Yeah, 7 p.m., karaoke in the conference room. I'm the MC. Oh, cool. Thank you. Good morning. - Did we get all the waivers signed? - Yeah. Okay people, good morning. Please take a seat and we will get started. Hi. All right, everyone, get ready for the adventure of a literal freaking lifetime. My name is Beckett, and I will be your hiking guide and instructor. If you take a look behind me, you will see the map of our route. We'll be working our way through some of Connecticut's 51 miles of the Appalachian Trail, and we'll be covering about 30 miles in New York state. It is daunting, but it is beautiful. All right, on our hike, we're going to recreate responsibly. You can see the principles here, they include leave no trace, and plan and prepare. That is what we're doing right now. Okay, internalize these. We'll start an hour from here, and end at my favorite spot, the Painted Meadow. Before we really dig in, we're gonna go around the room very quickly, just to familiarize ourselves with each other, then we get to outfitting. Remember, these people here are your team. Okay, name and what you're doing here, go. Hi, I'm Windy. Not Wendy, Windy with an "I". I'm 28. I just finished my master's, and I am here because the outdoors are my life. And also, my older brother took the course last year and said it was amazing. He broke his leg, but I just feel like that was his fault. I remember him. - It was his fault. - Yeah. Next. Hello. Uh, I'm Hugh. I am... ...years old. Uh, I'm old enough not to discuss my age. She knows what I'm talking about. Um, I'm an aspiring actor. So, I love, love, love a challenge, but I hate, hate, hate frustration. I'm here to get past that. So, I just want to luxuriate in pain and frustration, really. Good. You will. Next? Oh, yeah. What up? Mason, 28. Commodities trader, living that, uh, trader lifestyle, you know what I mean? Uh, I've been hiking since I was a baby. So I'm just here just to keep in practice, you know? Anybody have any questions, just, I'm an open book. Great, and if you have questions, please ask me. - Thank you. - Or me. Take a seat. Nope, not you. Take a seat. Thank you. Uh, next? You. Okay. Well, my first question is, how old are you? This isn't about me. Name and what you're doing here. My name is Helen and I'm an English teacher. I live in Pittsburgh, and... I'm here because I got a divorce. My ex and I broke up over a year ago. There was some infidelity and we'd actually been separated for a very long time before we got divorced. But it's... It's like a rash. You know, it clings to you, it kind of lingers with you, so... I think I want a reset. Yeah, you don't realize it, but life really takes a toll. I had a miscarriage, uh, long before we even got separated, so the family that I always wanted to have went to shit. And so I am here because I want to stop breaking promises to myself, and I want to start keeping them, and so this... This is the first step of many. But I think by saying it out loud that I am going to mean it. Okay, that's great. You can, uh, take a seat. Um, next? How about you? Hi, I'm Jake. I was a medical professional, a doctor, but, uh, I'm not really doing that anymore. And I guess I'm out here for, uh, the same reason that she is. I didn't catch your name. Her name is Helen. Helen. Right. What Helen said really resonated with me, you know? Sometimes, uh, life takes a toll, and you gotta figure out a way to fight back. So I guess that's why I'm here, to fight back. Okay, great. Next? Hi, I'm Sue, from Millennial. And I am taking a vow of silence on our hike. It's about deepening my commitment to my spirituality. And trust me, it's not gonna be easy, because, A, I've never done anything like this before, and, B, I was a debater in high school and college, so I love a good retort. But I think I'm gonna start my vow right now. - Starting right now? - Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Well, now. - Okay. - Hi. I'm Kaylee. Um, I'm here to face my fear of wood. When I was eight years old, my dad built us a log cabin. He didn't do any waterproofing, so, uh, it was uncomfortable, to say the least. When it rained, it was like being buried in a dark, wooden coffin. It was not a good memory. So... Uh, okay. Now, outfitting. I think... Ooh. Hey, are your, uh, shoes brand new? Didn't you get the shoes we sent? Yeah, but I forgot them at home. Luckily these sort of fit, so that's good. You are the problem. Okay, people, we will rise with the sun and hike six to 12 miles every single day. You'll have a few zero days. Days where we do nothing. But you won't get many, so enjoy them when you get them. Ticks are no joke out here, okay? Pull your socks up high and do your tick checks religiously. You should've gotten your hiking boots a few weeks ago and all have them broken in by now. Socks are very important. If they get wet, you will get trench foot. You need to take them off and dry them out. You can hang them on your packs. You will be sleeping in tent groups of two. You will all be exhausted. You will hate everyone around you, and you will all be farting your faces off, okay? That's what happens with dehydrated food. This is not hiking for beginners. Well, it's actually listed as hiking for beginners in the catalog, right? Right. It is. You know what I mean. We will resupply at the midpoint. We're only bringing what we need. No shampoo. No deodorant. If you bring it, I will make you eat it, all right? And please, bring some underwear. Me? Be surprised. I brought underwear. I... Okay, that's it. You can bring one notebook to serve as a journal and one book for entertainment. You can bring your cell phone, but it will not work. - Yeah? - What if there's an emergency? I have a satellite phone. Where do we poop? We'll helicopter you to base to poop and pee. - Really? - No, not really. Just like a bird or an animal of the forest, you will be using this big, round earth as your toilet. Finally, at the end of our hiking experience we will all vote to see who wins the coveted BSC best outbackers certificate. Finish up with supplies here in the next hour, load your packs immediately, and then you can all go grab dinner at La Rosa. That's the only game in town, all right? I'll see you all at the bus at 6 a.m. tomorrow morning. If you are late, you will not be hiking. Let the games begin. You confirmed the driver, right? Kaylee? All right, everybody come up here. - Make sure you have everything. - A buck 20, easy. Hey, what the hell are you doing on my trip? Your trip? Yeah. Did Duncan send you to keep an eye on me? No. Well, you need to leave. I'm not going anywhere. Okay. I'm doing this on my own. On your own? With Beckett, and six other people? Look, I signed up for this trip ages ago, okay? You're stuck with me. God, you're so annoying! Okay, from this point on, we don't know each other. So don't even talk to me, don't even look at me. Done. I'm not gonna talk to you, and I definitely won't look at you. Not once. Not even when you're crying for my help. Okay, good, because I won't. Okay, great. Perfect. Now, get out of my face. You guys got everything? Yep. Hey, Beckett, you know, I still feel like I'm missing some pretty pivotal information. It's an experiential hiking course. You learn as you go. Here, this'll help. Okay. Uh, it's just that, uh, I still feel a tad under-educated for a beginner hiker. It's all in there. You'll figure it out. And what if I don't? Then you'll die. Hey. I don't understand why there's no coffee. I'm homicidal without it. Ugh. It's going to be so much harder than I thought. You keep saying things like that. Things like what? Like this is so terrible and it's gonna be so much harder than we think it is. - Why? - Yeah, sorry. I tend to do that. I know it's a thing. I'm trying to stop it. My mom thinks it's like a self-fulfilling thing, you know? Say good things, good things will happen. If you say bad things, bad things happen. - Yeah. - I tried it with acting. You know, "I'm a good actor. I'm a good actor." "I'm gonna get jobs. I'm Meryl Streep." Only, it doesn't work. I'm not Meryl Streep. I sell insurance. So... It's a good job. - It was a night... - Miss Chaplin over here. Sue, what happened to the sound of silence? Oh, I'm gonna start tomorrow. I did tell Kaylee this crazy... No, no, no, no, no. I haven't had coffee yet, so keep telling Kaylee. Okay? I love you though. Kaylee, so we ran out of gas on the side of the road. Good mornting, supermodels. Well, hello there. Helen, you feeling okay? I'm not feeling okay. I should not have had that second margarita last night. You had a margarita? Yeah, well, I just said I had two, so, yeah. Well, did you bring a book at least to distract yourself? Um, no, I... I did not bring a book. Breaking the rules already. She forgot her book. - Right. - Tattletale. No, I didn't forget a book. I purposely didn't bring one 'cause I wanted to focus on the wilderness. Hm, okay. Well, I brought one. I brought The Latinos of Asia: How Filipino-Americans Break the Rules of Race. Oh, how do they do that? They do it... - I will tell you after I read the book. - Okay. So I brought a psychology textbook. And look at this. Jake brought a textbook too, but it's on whales. - And seals. - And seals. He's so cute. He's gonna go study them in Baja after this trip. It's so crazy. That is crazy. It actually seems insane. It's pretty insane. It's gonna be epic. You can borrow my whale book anytime you want, Hannah. My name's Helen. Okay, people, pop quiz, what do you do if you feel a hot spot? Deal with it. That's right, Ellen, a hot spot is the beginning of a blister. Think about it like a blister in training. If you feel one, stop and tend to it or it will bring you to your knees. This is our Normandy, people. Our D-Day. We hike ten miles. This is your last hour before the pain. So sleep, meditate, whatever floats your fancy. Let's do this!

Hey, people, time to use the facilities. Mm, where are they? Right there. I'll go with you. Ow! Ow. Shoot. Oh, no. Let's go, people! Get ready for what will be the best freaking experience of your entire lives. - Oh! What the hell is that? - Oh my God, your leg. - I'm fine. - Is that blood? No, you're not. How'd you do that? Are you serious? We haven't even started yet. - What? I stumbled putting on my backpack. - God, who's got the med kit? Jake. Can we just go? I'm fine. This will dry up in no time. Dry up? Looks like you've hit an artery. You know what? We've got an injury here. Let's gather round. - A lot of blood. - Can we not gather? This is ridiculous. All right, doc, as our designated EMT, this one's all you. All right everyone, let's watch J-Dog here work his magic. Actually, let's take a seat. Oh, come on. How did you find the sharpest rock in the forest? - I'm lucky like that. - Such a dumb move, Ellen. Uh, last time I cut myself like that, I fell going up the stairs. Not down the stairs. Up. Hit my head. Head bleeds, you know, a lot. - How's that vow of silence going? - I'm on a break. Can we, give us a little space here? Stand over there, please? So you finally divorced dipshit, huh? Yeah, I did. - Thanks for asking. - Yeah. I'll never know what you saw in him. All right, all done. - Thank you. - A strange place to start. - I think it's beautiful. - Here. This barn reminds me... What are you doing? I got it. I got it. Jake, you good? - Yup, she's great. - Packs on, everybody. Ready? - Ready. - Ready! Okay. Yeah, can we do this? Follow me, everyone, and make sure we stay together. Guys, this is more wood than I thought. It's a forest. This way, guys. Work as a team. When he said no shampoo, did he mean no dry shampoo? All shampoo. It's lethal to the native algae and bacteria. Seriously? That's what we care about now? Watch your step, it's rocky. Is this all uphill? This is what we call level one fun, people. - You call this rocky? - What's level two fun? Just one second, Mason. Oh, come on, man. Look, I know it sucks to go slow, man, but teamwork is a wilderness skill too. Remember that. There's a clearing a few miles ahead with big rocks. We'll stop for lunch. I'm going for it then. Good work everyone. - Just a few more miles and then lunch. - This is a beautiful day. Yes, it is. We're very lucky. All right, hydrate, everyone. We've got three more hours until we stop. I know most of you haven't seen this because Ellen is all the way in the back... - Who? - Me. There's a blue man. - Hey! - Greetings. She has stepped on two logs that lay across our path. Why don't we do that? - They could be rotten. - Right. I was gonna say that. A rotten log will not support your weight. That's a broken leg and an emergency evac. Don't do it again, Ellen. You can sit on a log. Your butt is wide, your weight is distributed. - You can't break your butt. - Bet she could. Hey, Beckett? My name is Helen with an "H". Okay, pack it up. We're on the move. Nice medium strides, people. That was shady. Gonna be dark soon, maybe we should set up camp. Good idea. What's for dinner? Keep moving everybody. Okay, let's see. This looks like a good first place to set up for the night. All right, at camp, there is no hierarchy. We all contribute. Jake, you're on fire duty. Windy, start separating the food. Uh, Mason, Sue, Hugh, Helen, and I will all start pitching the tents. And, uh, Kaylee, just... hang tight. But seriously though, what's for dinner? If you'd sold the blow-off top in April, you could have got a two-dollar down move in copper. We're laying a base for an inevitable move back up. Are you in metals? Precious? Or are you just looking at the macro? Oh. Well, I'm actually just still crunching numbers. Wait, how... How long have you been doing this? Trading? Um, about four years, with, like, a 25% annualized return. So I like to force myself to go on these little adventures. - You know, get away from the desk. - Same. Yeah, people assume they know who I am because of all this. But, uh, I'm more than the sum of my parts. I think... I think we're all more than we seem to be. Anyone know what a bear hang is? Friday nights at my house. It's when you hang your food up between two trees to keep it away from bears. Correct? Why? So the bears don't eat the disgusting, dehydrated food. - Yes. - Or to keep bears away from your campsite. That's right. Someone grab the food bags and follow me. We just sat down. Oh my God. Okay, who wants to be our first bear-hang volunteer? Jake? Okay. He probably needs the practice. So, ideally, you want your bag hanging 12 feet in the air, split between two trees that are at least 12 feet apart. Why? Because a bear can climb up the trees and try to reach for it. - You want to keep it out of reach. - That's right. So you want two ropes, about 50 feet each. These are ropes that are made for a bear hang, so they're light. Helen, can you throw your water bottle to Jake, please? Then attach your water bottle using a carabiner. We will then tie off those two pieces of rope to two different trees once the bag is hanging. God. The bear can just have my food because this is like solving cold fusion. I love fusion cuisine. We are now going to swing our ropes over two opposite branches. - I'll do this one. Jake, you do that. - What did he say? That doesn't clear anything up for me. - All right, Beckett. - Let's see what you got, Beckett. Show us what you got! Oh! Almost. - Shake it off. - Try it one more time. You got this! - Oh, wow! - Good form. Nice job. Okay, here we go, wind it up. Oh. Watch your nose. You're gonna wanna underhand that. Have you done this before, Beckett? Yeah, of course. - You got it. - One more. One more. All right. - Oh, there it goes. - Yeah. - There it is. - Nice shot. He got it. He got it. So, once your rope is over the branch, you'll wanna clip your food bag to it. - Yeah? - Should we expect to see a bear here? You know, it's the wilderness. So I'd say expect anything. What about large stray dogs? That is very unlikely. - Um, what if the bear is rabid? - If the bear is rabid, it's all over. - What's all over? - Can't the bear chew through the rope? Well, that is also very unlikely, but if a rabid bear is that persistent, you're already dead and he's not hungry anymore. And that's why they call it the circle of life. - Mufasa. - Jake, can I get you over there? We are now going to hoist up our bag. This is it. See how the sausage gets made. Just hand over hand. It shouldn't be so heavy that you can't lift it easily. And you just tie the rope to secure it. See, it's easy. Right. It's getting dark, people. Let's get back to camp. Yeah. I... My fingers are frozen. - It got so cold, so fast, right? - I know, my goodness. - I am not used to this. - I'm from California, I'm not either. You doing okay? Yeah, always. You? I really miss my mom. I'm sure we all miss our moms though, right? Yeah. How do you miss her? Well, we're sort of like best friends. We talk almost every day. - Hm. - Are you close with your mom? Well, my grandma, whose name is Gigi, actually raised my brother and me. Oh, I see. Um, and may I ask what happened to your mom? Um, it's a lot, and I'm pretty tired, so I don't think we should get into it now. That's okay, totally fine, yup. So, do you have an outback crush? Oh. Uh, outback crush? Wow. Uh, well, the options are pretty limited, aren't they? That is fair. I'm kind of surprised at myself, actually, because I don't know what is happening to me, but, girl, I am crushing on Jake. He is so nice, so fine, and just not like a pushover, you know? And he's a doctor! Hm. I know he said that. I think he was a doctor. But apparently, he quit. So he's more a quitter, I guess, than a doctor. Oh, well, I got the impression that he's just, like, taking a break. Hm. But even if he is, he's going on adventures and studying whales. Yeah. You don't think that's a little nutty? He's, like, a grown man going to study whales. It's like he's eight years old. Well, I think he's kind of a badass. Oh, yeah. Well, no. For me, badasses don't go, like, study sea life, but... I don't know. He seems weird. - Well, good night. - Good night. Yes. Hot dog? - Morning, guys. - Hey. - Oh, damn it. - Busted. Hey, Jake? Yeah. Here you go. Got a little headache? - I do, yeah, now that you mention it. - Hm. - You should drink more water. - Okay. You can take a Tylenol later, too, if it gets worse. Also, your hat looks tight, might be the hat. - Feels fine. - Like some coffee, Ellen? Sure, yeah. My name is Helen with an "H". Really? Helen? With an "H", Helen. Hm. Thank you. Hey, um, I need help with my bandage. Oh, yeah, right. Um, you want to sit on that rock? - I'll grab the first aid kit. - All right. Why is this coffee so good? I don't know. I'm a badass at making coffee? I have heard tales about what a badass you are. If you're such a badass, why do you have so many glasses around your neck? Are you sure you brought enough? Wow. You're so mad that I'm here you're gonna make fun of my glasses? Real mature. Are you gonna make fun of Hugh's glasses too? No. Look, I am farsighted, so I need these sometimes. These are sunglasses. Oh, and the sun is bright, that makes sense. Yeah, and I have a night vision thing. Whatever. Why does it matter? Uh... Hey, my knee is fine. I have some blisters, but if you just give me the stuff, I can take care of it. Actual blisters? - Shh. - Were you not taking notes? Yes, I did. I wrote down "deal with it," like five times. But then I didn't deal with it on time. Anyway, give me the stuff and I can do it myself. Show me. Holy shit. It looks like a horror movie. Why didn't you say something? Because after my knee and being last all day, I didn't wanna hold us up again. It doesn't... Anyway, I'm strong, so I don't really notice pain. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Helen, are you depressed? What... What are you talking about? Why are you here? Probably the same reason you are. That's impossible. Okay, um, well, I'm out here because I wanted to take on a new challenge and... go beyond my limitations, and just sort of... reset my life. Hold on. Other foot. You know, people get seriously injured on these hikes all the time. I know, but they're under new management. New management? Beckett? You trust Beckett's management? It didn't give you pause when you signed those 11 waivers? No. I'm planning to get a certificate. You'll be lucky to survive. Oh, no, no, no. See, that's where you're wrong. You think you're talking to the old, lame, teacher, go to bed by 9:30 p.m. Helen, but you're not. - Huh? - This is the new and improved Helen. And this Helen spits in the face of danger and pees in the woods. New Helen sounds really gross. Yeah. Well, she is. Sorry, what is with this night-vision thing? It's, uh... Nothing. Just don't mention it to anyone, okay? Why not? - I didn't pass the physical. - Are you crazy? We don't hike at night. So it doesn't really matter. You just finished saying how dangerous it is out here, and that's for someone with perfect eyesight. Yeah, well, just like you, I needed to face some challenges. You guys okay? - Yeah. - Real good. - Oh my God, you've gotta be kidding me. - It's okay. Okay, listen up, people. Helen with an "H" got four blisters on day one. Oh my God. Here we go again. We must blame Mason in part for Helen's blisters. Why? Here's why. Because people like Mason, who are super-hikers, put pressure on the not-so-super hikers like Helen. Hikers like Mason get people injured just as often as hikers like Helen do. Wait, seriously, dude? Um, I only injured myself. Do not be a Mason. Have a good attitude and be a team player. And don't be a Helen. If you feel a hot spot, like I explained in great detail on the bus, and before the bus, and after the bus... - Deal with it. - Immediately. Helen with an "H," are you even using your waist belt? Oh, my God. Outbackers, 80% of your pack's weight should be on your hips, not your shoulders, all right? So tighten your waist belt or else you're gonna get tired very fast. I tend to do better when people point out the things I'm doing right. Do something right, I'll point it out. I've heard that before. All right, scoot the boot. Let's go, people.

You just went straight in. - Yeah, I mean... - It was so you. I guess it was. Beckett, I just have to ask you. My brother said he broke his leg trying to play soccer with a rock. - Is that true? - It's absolutely true. Your brother was the bane of my existence. - You're studying happiness? - Yeah. Psychology used to focus on the problems, like neuroses and pathologies and disorders. But the idea was to analyze the f'd up parts of life in order to cure them. - Yep. - But I'm studying what people do right. How happy, well-adjusted people do things. That makes a lot of sense. All right, two minutes to hydrate, people. Eat a snack, if you must. I guess we're not sitting down. Every night before bed, I write down three good things that happened to me. - It's one of the exercises I'm studying. - And just like that, you're happy? Kind of. Like, name three good things that happened to you today. Okay, Windy, I don't think I could name three good things. Uh, the weather is getting colder and I'm low on natural gas, I get to drink white wine again, and I'm okay not wearing deodorant. - Those are good. - Did not need to know that. Okay, Helen, your turn. Okay. Um, well, I'm glad we're having this conversation. - One. - That's one. Um... The oatmeal this morning was slightly less rubbery. - Two. Keep it coming, dig deep. - I agree. Um... I have a good one. I love when you wake up in the morning and your face is cold from mountain air, but your sleeping bag is keeping your body so nice and toasty warm. I love that. - Yes, that is a good one. - It's magic. How about you, Windy? - Okay. Today. - Mm-hm. Mm, let's see. I loved the cowboy coffee that was on the stove this morning. - Love it. - The mossy smell that's in the woods. - The burn in my muscles as we're walking. - No, thank you. - A lot of burn. - And the fresh crispness in the air. You're too good. I've had more practice. Plus, it's kind of like my battle cry. "Appreciate everything!" My battle cry is, "Save the crying for your pillow, Kaylee!" Kaylee. Mine is probably, uh, "Get out of my face!" But I like, "Appreciate everything." - Well, we can share. - Okay. Keep it moving people, we got a ways to go. Okay. Why are you doing this, Sue? Why? Why are you taking the vow of silence? You're a talker, all right? Women should be talking. How about Mason take the vow of silence, my God. You're supposed to talk. No, we can do this. Keep it together. Just one more week. We got this. Okay. No. I can't have any more. I can't believe you're still eating that. I literally want McDonalds. - I'll take that. - Oh, thank you. Why did you come here? And don't tell me you're resetting again. You're not a begonia. What? Begonias are annuals. You have to reset them every year. Oh my gosh. Okay, no more flower humor for you, got it. Why did I come here? Um... You know, I think I just sort of got sick of being fed up with myself. - You know? - Hm. How about you? Oh, well, sort of the same, really. I wanted to push myself. You know, to feel like somebody. Mm-hm. I wanted to have a story to tell that's interesting, and not like the one I live every day. I could've been a lot of things in my life. Somewhere along the way, I just took a wrong turn and can't find my way back. Now I realize it's probably too late. Oh, no, Hugh, that's... It's okay. It's the truth. You know, I've come to terms with it, and it just feels good to say it out loud. Well, I know how that feels. Yeah. Meryl, it's our turn to clean the dishes. I'm coming! Kaylee. Thank you. Oh my God. What? Why do you keep looking at me? Is there something on my face? No. - Never mind. - Okay. Helen, be careful. Yeah, I was being careful. - No, you weren't. - What is your problem? Every time you do something stupid out here, somebody's gotta save you. - Why're you always trying to save someone? - What? Like when you went to California to save the dolphins. You remember that? Yeah, I remember that, 'cause you were acting like a big hero then, just like you're acting like a big hero now. No, I'm not. And they were sea lions. Okay, I see who you are, just so you know. You're the full of humility, unassuming doctor who loves seeded bread, and is great at the outdoors, and looks down on the rest of us like we're idiots. I'm not looking down on anyone. I'm not paying attention to anyone except... I wish you would say what you're thinking instead of staring at me like a weirdo. Okay. You were too good for him. That's what you wanted to say? Yeah. Here in the woods in this moment, that's what you wanted to tell me? Okay, why do you think that you can tell me that? Because I don't... I don't want you to go back to him. Why would I do that? That's my question. How dare you think that you can talk to me about my shitty marriage. When you've lived my life, and made the mistakes that I've made and you've walked in my shoes, then maybe you can say something, but until then, why don't you mind your own business? And I don't need saving. Thank you so much. Do you know why? 'Cause I'm saving myself. So you can stop that now. Okay, guys, we're going a bit off book tomorrow. We've made a lot of progress the past ten days, so I'm breaking us up. We're gonna put your navigation skills to the test. We'll be hiking the same trail but leave 30 minutes apart and meet up for dinner. It's an easy trail, we're gonna pack out completely. You should all be back here before sundown to set up camp again. Oh, my... Can we just leave camp set up? Are we hiking in our tent groups? God, I hope not. Please say no... We'll be splitting in groups by speed. Fastest four will go together and slowest go together. Except for Mason. - You will be going with the slower group. - Come on! Teamwork, you're gonna learn it, one way or the other. - Get some shut-eye. We pack out at dawn. - Wait. Oh, come on, man. Can we discuss this? Oh, believe me, I would love to discuss it. Discussion over! We're a team. Take it back, now over there. Yeah, that's all right. See you guys for dinner. Bye, guys. Holy Mary, Mother of God, am I seeing things? - Is this a piece of paper? - What? How do you collapse? Seriously? Actual litter? Come on, circle up. How many times have we talked about respecting nature? Huh? Leaving no trace? "Find a deeper connection to nature." "Rise up from the ashes like a freaking Phoenix." "And earn a damned certificate." Neat. Somebody wanna claim this? Anyone? Hm? No one? Look, what did I tell you guys would happen if I saw you litter? Huh? - You said you'd go crazy. - Right! Oh. Oh my God. I almost forgot. Hey, Beckett. Take a few deep breaths, buddy. Take a few deep breaths. Everything around us is flammable. I'm making a point. The world isn't your garbage dump. - What is he doing? - Do it again and I'll scorch the earth. - Bro, what are you doing? - Isn't... First group, 30 seconds! Windy, I need your help. Can someone pick that piece of paper up? - He has finally snapped. - Anybody else enjoy that? - Like a freaking Phoenix, huh? - I'm not gonna talk about it. Okay. Hey, um... I did wanna say I'm sorry about last night. It was... Do not worry about it. Let's forget about it, 'cause I'm sorry too. Here. Why don't you hold on to that? - But you can't read it yet. - Let's do this! - Why? - Thirty minutes apart people. Well, what will you hold on to? I'll figure something out. Hey, guys, wait up! I think Windy's got a big crush on Jake. I mean, who doesn't? I actually think they'd be so great together. Really? I sense some real tension between the two of you. Some real vibes going on. Oh, no, no, no. The truth is we actually know each other. He's my little brother's best friend, so I've known him for years. And we both signed up for this trip weeks ago without knowing that the other person had. Okay. I can't believe you're just telling me this now. Also, when we were at La Rosa, he said he signed up for this just the other day. Like the other day, like right before getting here? - Yeah. - Oh. - Weird. - Yeah. I don't know. Helen, you wanna give me a hand with this? Okay, here I come. Does a kiss count if it's for two seconds? - I didn't see them kiss. - I did. Well... You guys, have we seen any markers? - What markers? - It's so tragic. - What is? - Jake's the best kisser and he's taken. I can't believe we're still talking about this. Okay, let's hydrate, people. How do you know that he's such a great kisser? We don't know. Windy told us. He only kissed her though. He quit the game right after that. - Love at first kiss. - Oh my gosh. That's not really a thing. - Could we stop talking about this? - They have chemistry, it's obvious. Well, tree bark has chemistry with that guy. - Yeah. - What do you mean that he's taken? With Windy. She's got a crush on him. He's gotta have a crush on her. Well, but that's unconfirmed. They both love sheepdogs, waffle fries, sailing, and wine, so... Kaylee, everybody loves those things, especially waffle fries. I don't like that trail name. "Doomsday"? She's really smart. We should call her... "Smart Sauce." That was dumb. "Smarty-pants?" Nope, not your best. They're both great bear hangers and they love wine. How are they not married yet? Give it time. This is how people meet and fall in love. Hey, Mason's gotta pee. Ew. What a picture. Okay, guys. Wait, I have the map. Yep, help me, Mason. But you can't really know your parents. Not like their friends knew them growing up. By the time they have you and start raising you, the people they were are gone. Lost in a grown-up world. It's... It's sad. Yeah, it is sad. Don't make me cry in the woods, Kaylee. Jeez. Are we picking up the pace at any point, or is this it? Mason, you need a nap. - Oh, no. - I'm getting hungry. Hey Hugh, can I see the map? Come on, we can't be stopping again. Why does my water taste like a hamburger? Oh my God, yum. Cannot wait to eat a burger. - Oh, no. - Balance beam! We were supposed to go over this mountain. - We should have taken a left back here. - I always wanted to be a gymnast. But they told me I was a little too fat to take lessons, so... Oh my God. Hugh? - Oh my God! - Hugh? Are you okay? Hugh? Hugh? - Is he okay? - He's not. He's passed out. We have to get his pack off. Mason! - Mason! - Dude? Can you get that side? One, two... - Okay, all right. Hey. Hey, Kaylee, stop. - Sorry. - Can you stand? - No, I don't think so. He's face down. We can't leave him with his head down. No, no, no! I'm fine! I'm fine. Check the handbook, I'm sure you can leave my head like this. I've read the handbook cover to cover. It does not say anything like that. Are you supposed to move injured people? I don't think so, but we can't leave him with his head like this. - I know. - Okay. Um, uh, you guys grab his shoulders. I will grab his legs. - Mason, can you come help? - Wait, you know what? Actually, I'm feeling a lot better. - Leave me like this. My head is great. - It's gonna be okay. Put sunblock on my neck. We're going to flip him over like a pancake and lay him on the trail. - Okay, all right, ready? One, two, three. - No, no, no, no! Is one of his legs longer than the other one? Okay, yeah, it's broken. We have to splint his leg. Kaylee, grab two long sticks and, Sue, grab a long-sleeved shirt. - Oh God! - Can you move your foot at all? I heard a crack. Okay, that's not good. - Why did you step on that tree? - I got some wood. Didn't you hear Helen get yelled at? - Beckett said it a million times. - Stabilize the leg. Really, Sue? Read the room, okay? Oh, hey, there's a donkey. There's a donkey? Okay, no, he's... He's hallucinating. Can I get a number two with a large fries? Who's going for help? - You are. - You are. I can't feel my leg. This fully... Here is the handbook. It will answer any questions you have. I will be back as soon as I can. What if he dies? - That's not gonna happen. - What if he keeps talking about donkeys? That might happen. You're gonna be okay. I know Reiki. Okay, I'm going to get help, so just stay here with Kaylee and Sue, okay? I'm... I'm sorry. I... I didn't... I don't know what happened. I'm... It's okay. Hey, you guys, set up the sleeping bags and the tents right now and sleep in shifts, so one of you is awake with him at all times. Stay safe and warm. You guys need to work together, and I'm coming back for you, okay? You've got this. Okay, Helen, you can do this. You read the handbook. Just orient... the map to the trail. We're gonna have to figure something out. Obviously, this is more than just some people being slow. Something's gone wrong. - It's been hours. - Yeah. We just need to come up with a plan. - I know. - I can't just sit here. I know, but there's nothing we can do right now. It's too dark. I mean, if it was just a wrong turn, they would have been back by now. Worst case scenario, we will find them tomorrow. As long as... - Hey, guys. Hey, I found you. - Where the hell have you been? We missed a fork in the road, we got lost and Hugh fell. He's injured. How badly? Well, he stepped on a log. God, how many times have I told you guys not to step on logs? Yes, I know. You've told us many times. But his foot went through, and he fell forward and I think he's in shock. - Was Hugh conscious when you left? - Yes, but he passed out when we moved him. Why did you move him? He was hanging over a log. I put him on his back and splinted his leg. Good thinking. How did he look when you left? Pale. You know, clammy. We have to get him out of there. No, it's too dark. The first rule of rescue is not to add to the victim list. We evac in the morning. You did good. - We'll get him out tomorrow. - This is serious. Strike camp at 5 a.m. No food, no coffee. You fuel up at the site while Jake and I tend to Hugh. Tomorrow's gonna be a bitch. Hit the sack right now and start thinking about your person. - You're gonna need 'em tomorrow. - Okay, sounds good, yeah. Come here. Are you hungry? Or do you want some coffee? - Yeah, that'd be great, thank you. - Yeah. Honestly, I feel a little bit in shock. It all happened so fast, and, like, he was down. - And Mason, just... Thank you. - Yeah. I mean, he just shut off. It was like that. - I don't know what happened to him. - Yeah. I'm really glad you're okay. Yeah, thanks. I can't sleep. I'm sorry if I'm keeping you awake. Well, you're fine. I, uh, can't sleep either. What did Beckett mean when he said we were gonna need our person today? Well, we did a, um, an exercise where he wanted us to think about one person who really loves us and believes in us, and if it gets really hard at any point out here, we're sort of gonna, uh, turn to that person in our heads to draw strength from to keep going. So who's your person? My mom. Oh, yeah, your mom's great. She always remembers everyone's names. She... made the best icebox cake. Yeah, she still makes that. What about you? Who's your person? Probably Nathan. - Is he the, um, the brother that you lost? - Mm. Do you know about him? Uh, I know that there was some kind of accident, but Duncan has never really told me about it. Yeah. Um... We were so close. We did everything together. We would build forts. We played this... Anyway... I won't get into it now if we're trying to go to sleep. No, it's okay. I wanna hear about it. Um, well, we had just turned five and I was six, and we were all at my parents friends' lake house and, um... And Nathan really wanted to go see the boats. He loved boats. And he kept begging me to go with him to the marina, and, um... I wanted to stay... at the house and watch a movie with the other kids and, um... he went out. But I didn't notice. Nobody noticed. And, uh... Yeah, and they found him later that night. That's awful. So sorry. And so, of course, all I ever think about is why didn't I go with him? Why didn't I just get my parents to take him? - Well, you were six years old. - Yeah, but... Yeah, I understand that logic, but... But it doesn't change anything. Duncan was sick a lot. And my mom just... Well, yeah, she just unraveled. And that's when my parents got divorced and my dad left us. And then, my mom just dropped us off at Gigi's one day. And she never came back. Do you know she texts me? She sends me text messages, asking me how I'm doing. So I... I always write back, "Oh, I'm great." Well, that's because you are always great. I don't think I've ever actually been great. But I'm great at losing people. I've lost Nathan, and my parents, and now... - You haven't lost Duncan. - No. He didn't ask to be born, you know. He was thrown into this... shitshow the same way you were. Yeah, but I'm so mad at him. I know it's unfair. I know that. But I... He didn't have to go through what I went through. He... He doesn't go around carrying this weight that I carry around. It's... Well, your parents left him too. Yeah. Okay, tomorrow is gonna be brutal. We should probably get some sleep. Oh, did you kiss Windy? Uh... Yeah, I did, but... We were playing Truth or Dare. Oh, it was Truth or Dare? Now it all makes sense. Wait. What... Why do you even care? You're the one who still talks to her ex-husband. Like, you guys are... He calls me. Yeah, and you keep answering. You know, all you talk about is how your breakup is lingering with you and it's clinging to you, but that's not what I see. I see you clinging to it, and to... To him. Okay, um, just so you know, I don't cling to anyone or any man, and I'm perfectly capable of talking to a person who used to be my husband without having some... Sure. As long as that's all it is, right? Why do you sound like a jealous boyfriend right now? Why do you sound like a jealous girlfriend? You know what? From now on, go ahead, kiss any beautiful 20-something who has a mouth... - One person. - And I can talk to any loser ex-husband. Or any loser. And we won't bother each other about it. - Helen... - Oh, never mind. Just forget it. Good night. Okay, so I'm not sure what to expect once we get to the site, so, we're all gonna have to keep our wits about us. Wait, you know what? - Helen? - Yeah? You administered care to Hugh, set Mason, Sue, and Kaylee up for the night and found your way back to us. - You're our navigator this morning. - Okay. Good job. Great work, Helen. Okay, let's do this. ♪ Oh, I've loved you so very long ♪ ♪ And inside your sweet company ♪ ♪ Green... ♪ Sue, hand me your knife. I'm going to end it. ♪ I know, Greensleeves You were my desire ♪ - ♪ Greensleeves, you were all my... ♪ - Oh my God. Helen? Helen! Oh, thank God. - Hey. - Oh, my gosh. You came back. Yeah, of course.

Yeah. Okay. We're gonna make a litter for Hugh. Who's got the bear hang rope? Uh, you three. We'll need, uh, two sticks, about eight feet long. They should be strong enough to carry him. Mason, give me three jackets. Come on, make it happen, people! Okay, we'll meet you there in a couple of hours. Thanks. You're gonna be okay, Hugh. - You're gonna be all right, buddy. - Okay. Closest trailhead is three miles east. We'll meet a team member there with an ambulance. Okay, let's recap. Mason, Helen, Jake, and I will take Hugh, day packs only. Leave backpacks here, get them on the way back. I'll take Hugh's pack. Uh, Windy, Kaylee, and Sue, you will carry all the food and toiletries to the campsite at Painted Meadow. See you guys for dinner. Tomorrow's a zero day, folks. Let's get to it safely. - Bye! - Bye. Good luck. Love you, Hugh. How's he doing? Well, he's in a lot of pain. He did say that Helen was his hero. You got something right, Helen, with an "H". Good job. I'm gonna need a second, okay?

You're just saying that 'cause you're all hopped up on pain meds. Yes. But also, it's true. I really do like you. A bit of advice. If you like him, just tell him. Oh, Helen, nothing matters out here. It's like space. Real life is suspended. I'm not really in this gurney with one extra-long leg. I'm in my bed at home, and I'm gonna wake up any minute now. Okay, listen, he is my little brother's best friend. - So many things make no sense... - Helen. You said you wanted to reset, so reset with that cute thing.

I've just been pretending and acting like a dick for so long that, honestly, I don't even notice when it's happening. Well, I mean, you're aware of it and it sounds like you're working on it. I was gonna go for a walk, do you want to come with me? You know what? I think I'm gonna stick around here for a little bit. If that's all right. - Yeah, of course. - Yeah. Thanks for the coffee. - Hey. - Good morning. There's a good trout fishing spot over there in that pocket. Oh, cool. My dad used to take me fishing here growing up. We'd hear all these stories about how this place was haunted or holy. Wow. I think it's both. I know, uh, this might come as a surprise to you, but I didn't really fit in much growing up. People didn't really know what to make of me. But, out here, I fit in. In the wilderness. I feel like I belong. Like I'm... part of something bigger. Uh... You don't have trench foot, do you? What?

You said, uh, I'm not fun anymore. And I have been thinking a lot about that. What do you mean? I think I said, "Remember when you were fun." Right, yeah. That implies I used to be fun. So when was I so much fun? Before... - Oh, before Mike. - Yeah. Yeah, well. Yeah. You remember you used to meet us out at that college bar on Smith? - Yes. - You were, like, the queen of karaoke. Yeah. You were always so generous. You never let us pay for anything. You must have spent a fortune on pizza and ranch. I mean, you guys were broke. - I'm really nice. - Yeah. Yeah, I remember you, Helen. I remember you seemed to really like your life and you laughed all the time. Yeah, I was young. I didn't have as much responsibility. Well, you're still really young. Yeah. Yeah, we're both young. Look at us. Two young people in the wilderness. - Until a bear gets us. - Right. Well done. These are beautiful. - Oh. - Hey, where is Doc? Oh, he's, uh, down the river. Looking for a better spot. Oh, I'll go look for him. How do we cook them? You gotta gut it, clean it out. Thank you for your sacrifice. I'm gonna call the head. Lot of protein.

Hey, are you hurt? Why are you on the ground? - No, I'm... I'm... - Hey. Thank you for coming for me. Yeah. Are you okay? I'm just... I'm scared. Scared? What... Why? Everything's fine. I lost my glasses and I... How did you lose them? Don't you have those... Yeah, I did. But they got caught on a branch and fell off. And I looked too long. And that sounds so stupid. It doesn't sound stupid. You lost your glasses. And it's really dark out here. Helen, I'm... I'm losing my eyesight. - Sorry, what do... What do you mean? - It's a genetic thing. It's called retinitis pigmentosa. All the cones and the rods in my eyes are dying one by one. Oh my gosh. So, that's... Yeah. That's why you quit being a doctor. Yeah. I started noticing it a few years ago and it's just gotten worse so fast. Especially at night, you know. And I feel like I don't know who I am anymore. I used to be able to take care of everything, and I just... I feel lost. I... I actually am lost... Hey. Hey. I'm here. And I know about being lost. You're not lost. - Jake? Helen? - Yup. Yeah, we're here. Well, thanks for, uh... For saving me. Now we're even.

This is insane. Feel like that's gonna make our hike tomorrow. It feels special on our last night. This is absolutely incredible. Okay, we're packing out, people. Nothing but footprints. Nice. This has been an amazing experience, apart from Hugh almost dying. When we get back to the bus, we'll fill out our ballots to vote on who wins the BSC "Best Outbacker" certificate. I know who I'm voting for. All right. Now, it's time to say goodbye to this beautiful place. Heads down, please. All-knowing mother, I'm sorry that we are such a blight. I'm sorry that we litter your earth and choke your fish with plastic grocery bags. We walk around dumb, and blind, and angry, and we cannot always see your incomprehensible beauty. Thank you for this world full of miracles and thank you for this gift we call Painted Meadow. We are not worthy of your love or the happiness that you provide. Thank you. And, uh, before we go, I would like to offer Mason a new trail name. Really? - Yeah. - All right, yeah, I accept. Good. From henceforth, your new trail name will now be Big Deer. - Big Deer. - That's cool. Deer symbolizes change. - I like it. Big Deer. - That's right, Chaplin. Big Deer! Woody, you're our navigator.

Go, Lulu! Wish I had never gotten on that tube. Um... Anyway, uh, anybody else wanna... Oh, Beckett's here with the award. Oh, I have not even counted ballots yet, so just give me, like, two seconds please. That's not a problem. You don't have to be that into it. It's fine... Windy! Wow, you look great. Talk about Buddhism in a bit? Drink? - Cheers! - All right, I love you. How's it going? Helen with an "H", how's it going? - You look good. - So do you, Mason. If you guys wanna just get your windpipes in shape, I also got some really great exercises. All right, all right, all right, everyone, we are now ready to award the certificate if you wanna come on over. All right, we're all here? Okay, great. Uh, the, uh, certificate goes to someone we all knew and loved very much. Hugh! - What? - Hugh? Beckett, he's not even here. What about Helen? Helen saved Hugh. She deserves the certificate. Yeah, I agree, but you guys voted for Hugh, so. - Nope, not me. - I did not. I might have. I... There... They both have "H". That's crazy. We need a recall. That's not how this works. It's fine, you guys. It's fine. To Hugh. And to Helen with an "H". - Woo! - Love you, Helen. Um, there's a tip jar in the back, uh, if anyone's feeling particularly generous. I don't believe in capitalism, but, you know, money still helps, so... Yeah, uh, Lulu will now have a night of, uh, very interesting karaoke, so enjoy. Interesting is just the beginning. It goes way farther than there, people. All right, um... - You had my vote. - ...take a five-minute break, but... You have risen from the ashes and become one with nature, Helen with an "H". That list is gonna follow me, isn't it? Don't drop your shit in the woods. Okay. Hey. I, uh... I voted for Hugh. I'm sorry, I didn't think you'd care. You know, I don't care, now that I didn't win. Oh. Oh, yeah. She wouldn't give it a rest. Doesn't believe he's taken. He's taken? Yeah, he's... He's got someone back home. Oh. Hey, guys. Of course he does. We're just talking about hopefully keeping in touch after this. All right, folks. Gang. It's really time to get stuff started. Helen? Hey, what's wrong? Where are you going? I'm going home. Come on. Just... C-Can you just stay? I can't. I really can't. Why? Wh-Why not? - Helen? - Where are you going? Hey. - Guys, I'm sneaking out early. - No. Yeah. I didn't wanna interrupt anything, but I'm going home. - Gonna miss you so much. - I'm gonna miss you guys too. - Okay, before you go, three good things. - Okay. Yes, okay. One, I'm... I'm glad nobody died on the trip. - Yeah, me too. - That's a plus. Two, I'm really happy about the great new friends that I've made. Mm. And three, I know myself better. I feel different. - I think that's four, but it's okay. - Okay. - Okay, you guys, I'm bad at goodbyes. - Bye. - I love you. See you soon.

I'm not in love. Who's that? I'll go get it. Hi! Hey. It's just me. - Come in. How was the drive? - Thank you. - Oh, it was super easy. - Good. How was your hike? I survived. I'm here. - Yeah? - So it was good. It was good. Wait. What are you... Oh. That's weird. Um... What... What are we doing? I want to say that everything between us has always been about me, and not you, and it's because I've been carrying around a lot of anger and guilt from what happened. And that's unfair to you, and I would love to start over. Loving this enlightened vibe that you're giving off. - This is nice. - Good. - Yeah. - Let's get some coffee, Gigi's in there. - You're still not taking sugar? - No, no, no. I am all about sugar. - You're back on the sugar. - Yup. It's the right move. Uh, okay, so you just go on a hike, you're just a completely new person all of a sudden, but can I just say I'm really happy you didn't die out in the woods. - Thank you. I'm not a complete idiot. - I know that, but, you know. We're gonna start talking about stuff now, aren't we? Yeah. I know it's uncomfortable, but we have to do that. Only way we're gonna figure our stuff out... - I don't wanna talk about... - Dunky, my boy! - Gigi! - You made it! Oh. - Okay, six o'clock ready, 6:30, go. - We're good to go. Where? To go where? We're doing a book club birthday party with Gigi's on-again-off-again boyfriend, Ricky. Hm, I might sit this one out. - You don't wanna go to the party? - No. You gotta go to the party. Why would you not go? - Okay. Yup, better sister. - Dance with me. You're onto something. Dance! - I said I would go. - You're gonna go! Happy birthday, Ricky. - Oh, Gigi! - Wow, yeah. Ricky and Gigi back together again. - Wow. - This makes sense. - Oh my gosh, it makes all the sense. - A beautiful thing. Wonderful thing. All right, this is the last one, or I'm gonna fall asleep. Two is a good limit for a lightweight. On our hike, we were always talking about who our person was, like the person we could depend on the most, and you have always been my person, and I hope I can be your person. Yeah, uh, you kind of always have been my person. Thank you, Dunks. I'm gonna live up to that. Okay, but first things first, we must dance to this song immediately. - I love this song.
