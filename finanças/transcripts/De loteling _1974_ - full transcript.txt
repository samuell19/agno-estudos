1833, a village square in the Campine. Conscription into the army occurred by drawing lots. This recruitment system was commonly known as the Blood Law. -Anthonissen. -Go on, take a number. 324, exempt. -Name? -Piet Willems. Go on, take a number. 28, conscripted. Damn. Vandenbrande. 44, conscripted. Get measured up. Vandewiele. 11, conscripted. Get measured up. -Karel Timmermans. 6, conscripted. -Right. They say you should use your left hand. At home they light candles in the chapel. That should work just as well. You know that if you're exempted there's money to be made. -Let me know. -I will. Honoré Blijckaerts. 9, conscripted. Idiot. You can't even do that right. You're going to cost me money, too. Take care of this, as cheaply as you can. If it weren't for his mother… Of course, sir. Give me fifteen minutes. I can't. You bastards. Let go. I can't. No. Let me go. I don't want to join the army. -Your name? -Jan Braems. Go on, Braems. Take a number. 434, Braems. You're exempt. Come on, I'll buy you a beer. -You were lucky. -Definitely, sir. I don't know how I'd have told them at home if I'd been conscripted. We're poor, you see. And with all that work… But there's a way of earning money without working so hard. I've never heard of that, sir. Another beer. -Is being a soldier working? -No, but you don't earn any money. That's what you think. But if I were to pay you a nice sum for doing it… You? Why would you do that? Hey, lads. I'm exempt. Flup, I'm exempt. I'm exempt. Hurray, I'm exempt. Lads, I'm exempt. Hey, lads. I'm exempt. I'm exempt. Listen, you give me your number, I give you a different one and some money. I don't dare tell Katrien that. Then don't tell her. Say you've been conscripted and the money's yours. Take it with you, to the army, too. She'll be so happy when you return. It'll be a surprise. You can get married, buy a farm. Have three cows instead of one. -I'm worried. -What's wrong? -I'm scared. -Scared? Why? You know why. For Jan. What if he has been conscripted? Let's wait and see. I won't get any sleep tonight. I love him so much. -I don't, I suppose? -That's different. You're his grandfather. -What's that? -What? -That voice? -Oh, that's nothing. That's Klaas's dog. His mistress died last night from galloping consumption. That's a bad omen. They're coming. They're coming. -I'm exempt. I drew the right lot. -I'm exempt. I drew the right lot. I'm exempt. I'm exempt. I'm exempt. -I've been conscripted. -Jan. Jan, tell me it's not true. You haven't been conscripted. I have, Katrien. I have. Straighter, damn it. Straighter, damn it. Giddy-up. Bloody hell. Back. Back. Your turn. My Katrien will never get the hang of it. Come on. Leave it. -Back. -I didn't know you were like that, Jan. -I thought you loved me. -You know I love you. But what are you going to do when I'm in the army? It's always the same ones who do the work. -You don't have to be cross with me. -No. What on earth have I done? What do you mean, Jan? -You can't help it. -Bastards. Passing laws, all for the rich. But I'm not going. If the gendarmes come to get me, I'll get my pitchfork. Jan, my boy. I'm not your mother, but can I give you some good advice? Be careful not to get into bad company. And stay devout. You know what I mean. Keep yourself pure. I'll think of you all. Every day. And let us know how you are. Well, Jan. Make sure that you don't get into trouble. -Yes, I'll make sure. -You are rather stubborn. And hot-tempered. Control yourself, eh? And do what your superiors tell you. Even if you think that they've got it completely wrong. You just have to think, they're my superiors. Bye, Jan. Come here. Bye. -You won't forget me, will you? -You don't need to ask that. I've promised it so often. Will you wait for me? I'll look after your grandfather and your brother while you're away. I'll do everything. Look after the horse and plough in a straight line. I'm strong and healthy enough. And when you return, everything will be the way it was. -Everything? -Everything. And I won't go to the fair when you're not here. I wouldn't enjoy myself anyway. And you mustn't do what the smith says, drink and chase girls. farewell, my love I have to leave you now farewell, my love I'm off to join the army farewell, farewell Shall be put to death, any soldier who capitulates having failed to defend himself in every possible way. Shall be put to death, any soldier who has left his post or abandoned his position to flee from the enemy. Any soldier on guard duty who leaves his post shall be sentenced to two years in a disciplinary company. He shall be sentenced to death if this was in the presence of the enemy. The soldier who refuses to obey his superiors shall be sentenced to five years in a disciplinary company. If this occurs in the presence of the enemy, the guilty soldier shall be sentenced to death.

Deserters are all soldiers who leave their corps or detachment without… -Karel, what's he saying now? -Something about being shot dead. …during peace time. Lads, I'm your doctor. I've got one thing to say. Make sure I see you as little as possible. I don't know where you come from, but I'm saying this for your own good. A good soldier is a soldier who keeps himself clean. You see here three decent lads, but they didn't listen to me. Of those who don't wash themselves every day with soft soap and behave badly outside barracks nine out of ten go blind. Understood? Only cleanliness can keep you healthy. And make sure that your collar and shako aren't too tight. Get up. Get up. Get up, all of you. Come on. Get up, I said. Are you still asleep? Come on, get up. Don't you understand? Do you understand this? Get up. Come on, get up. Get up, I said. Get up. Are we busy picking daisies? Or are we praying? Hurry up, my friend. Go on. Outside. Go on. Outside. Those who understand French, raise your hand. -Do you speak Flemish? -No. -What about you? -Nor do I. -And you? -Yes, a bit. Come here. Tell them what I order. You and you, come with me. The others can stand at ease. You can come too. Follow. -Pick up those baskets. -Pick up baskets. -And follow me. -Follow. Empty them. Empty. They must put hay in their left boot, the foot nearest to the stables. Hay in the clog nearest to stables. Like this. You too. Come on. Listen carefully. When I say 'hay', you lift up that leg. Hay. Pay attention. Hay. Hay. Hay. Alright. Now straw in the other boot. Now straw in the other clog. -March. -Hay, straw, hay, straw, hay, straw. About turn. It's dinner time. I've almost finished. You haven't done much, eh? When I was younger, I used to dig up this much in half a day. What good will that do me? Tomorrow they'll be coming for the rent. Is that your way of encouraging me? What's this? -Did you make this hole? -It was -the rats. -Rats? You should look after your things. That will cost you 7.75 francs. 7.75 francs? But it's not my fault. You've got two years to pay. As long as there's no war with the Dutch. Damn. Damn, this can't be true. Thieves. Filthy thieves. All my money has been stolen. Careful, Jan. Calm down, Jan. -Bastard. -Take him away. Bastard. It's all been for nothing. Filth. Excrement. We'll bring you to heel. Get up. Get up. Carry on. Faster. Mr. Blijckaerts, notary public, is today, 17th May 1834, proceeding with the seizure of the goods of Theofiel and Jan Braems. Once the furniture, potatoes and cereals have been sold, they are the buyers' responsibility. List of the objects in the house of Theofiel and Jan Braems in Bosbeke: A spinning wheel, butter churn, sheaves of wheat, pick, scales, a wicker chair, a red and white milking cow, a heap of manure, a silk handkerchief, two mouse traps, a drying pan, table and chest, an old bed, two earthenware cloches, chamber pot, wooden chairs, 14 year old draft horse. Legally seized to be sold at auction in Bosbeke on 10th June 1834. Whoa, Lizette. It's strange. He had enough money. Lizette. -What's up? You're so bad-tempered. -I don't know, Karel. -I feel so peculiar. -I know what's the matter. A big man like you, in weather like this and away from home for so long. You need a woman. I know one, she's just your size. -Karel, what's it going to cost? -Nothing, I'm paying. You're my friend. You can have the pretty one. Hay, straw, hay, straw, hay, straw… A customer for you. A novice. I'll take the mother. She can teach me a thing or two. Come on, colonel. What are you standing there for? Are you going to keep your clothes on? How do you want it? It's your first time, isn't it? Name? Braems. -Number? -110. -Enlisted? -8 months and 14 days ago. What's wrong with you? I'm listening. I'm in pain. Where? In my eyes. What did you do to them? -I washed them. -Washed them with what? They told me to wash my eyes with-- With your piss, I suppose? Your own piss? Incredible. In this day and age. We do our best to teach these louts the rudiments of hygiene and they listen to quacks. Now look. I have to tell you. Your eyes are in a bad state. Goodbye, Jan. Verger, could I use a pen and some ink? Yes, come with me Katrien. And how is your Jan? How our Jan is… Only the Lord knows that. It's been six months since we've had news of him. But he's a long way away, north of Maastricht, and acquaintances don't pass by here every day. -You and Jan had started courting. -Just. Isn't it strange that you haven't heard from him? Or maybe he can't write? He's probably forgotten you. Are you sure that I don't need to help you? As you wish. It will say things a stranger shouldn't see. No, verger. I wonder how you will be able to write a letter. How much do I owe you? Nothing. Seeing as it's for you. -Don't you want to eat first? -I couldn't. Tell me. What shall I write? Well, about everything that has happened. That I've had problems with my tonsils. And that I got kicked by the heifer. Write that you've picked up the pen to enquire about his health. That's how Peer Jans' letter started. No, I'm not doing that. That's far too formal. -Write his name on the paper. -Which name? Braems? No, Jan. "Jan." Just Jan is so abrupt. Wouldn't "Beloved Jan" be better? Beloved Jan? Yes, beloved Jan. Can't you write a bit faster? Otherwise it won't be written before next week. And tell him that we've lost the farm. No. I'm not going to write that. That would upset him too much. Read out what you've written. "Beloved Jan, how is your health? God be thanked, we are all keeping well, so is the horse and our cow, but not grandfather, who is ill. And we all wish you a good day. It's been six months since we had news of you, and we're wondering how you are doing with all those soldiers. And do you get enough to eat?" Pauwke, go and get the sickle. -Hello, Jef. How are you? -Fine, Katrien, fine. I've been to Venlo. I was there last week. I bumped into Karel, the potato farmer's son. Jan's friend. -He told me Jan isn't well. -Jan? What's wrong with him? Tell me. I've gone out of my way to tell you. He's in the infirmary. His eyes are bad. He's blind. He's blind. You don't dare say it. Mother, I'm going to Venlo. I've saved up just enough to get there. I must go to Jan. He needs me, I can feel it. -Come to keep me company? -Is this where Jan Braems is? Jan Braems? The one who's blind? So it's true. I knew it. Take me to him quickly. He'll be so happy. No one's allowed to visit the blind soldiers. That's unfair. I've come a long way and I'm not allowed to see him. -Please, let me in. -I'd get into trouble. Even if I have to break in, I will see him and talk to him. No one can stop me. I must see him. BLIND SOLDIERS Jan? -Jan? -Katrien? Oh, Jan. It's alright, Katrien. They see with their fingers. Come on, lads. Leave her alone. She's my girlfriend. You're scaring her. Hey, what's going on there? Who let you in? Leave immediately. I'm not doing any harm. Let me stay for another half an hour. No, not a minute longer. We'll put an end to this. I'm not allowed to let anyone in. Civilians aren't allowed in here. -Certainly not women. -Fifteen minutes. Have pity on us. You speak Flemish, just like us. Certainly not. I'll make sure you get nothing to eat. She's leaving, sergeant. You'll lose your stripes, you idiot. Throw her out. What's going on? That's the commander's wife. She's from Antwerp. She speaks Flemish. And she's a good woman. -What do you think I can do for you? -I don't know, madam. But they won't let me see Jan. And he's gone blind. And I've come such a long way. Wait a moment. Very charming. But what would you have me do, my dear? It's very kind-hearted of you, but I always stick to the rules. Don't you want me to do a good deed, Lucien? -De Hert? -Yes, commander? Do you remember circular 282 about the blind soldiers? Find it for me. Here it is. With the commander's permission blind soldiers may go on leave for an indefinite period pending the final-- That's perfect. -Go and fetch… What's his name? -Jan Braems, commander. Yes, fetch Baer. Braems, commander. Precisely, Baer. Is he your brother or a relative? I'm not his sister, but we've lived under the same roof since we were children. Well, then you're his sister. Get his papers ready and make a note of that. Would you like to take your Jan home with you? -Don't say that if you don't mean it. -I mean it. Don't I, Lucien? Of course. He may go home. Thank you, my dear. I'm allowed to go home with you. I'm allowed to go home. Damn it, if only I could see you. Thank you, madam. If you don't go to heaven, who will? Commander, there's a complication. He still owes two francs for his damaged knapsack. Have you got two francs? I've only got one and a half. -Well… -Forget it. We'll sort that out. -Thank you. -We have to help each other. There's enough quarrelling among the higher-ups. Good luck. -Katrien? Where are you? -Here, Jan. I'm here. Quiet. What's the matter? I was dreaming. I dreamt that I was lying here all alone. That you'd abandoned me. You mustn't think such a thing. You know that dreams are deceptive. I've got some food here. If I go too fast sometimes, tell me. We'll talk on the way. The time will pass quicker. And don't be sad. We'll be home in about four days. They will be so pleased to see you. He's fine there. It's cooler on the river than here. Thank you so much for helping us. I'll give you a couple of loaves. And a rope, so that you can tie him to you. You should go on a pilgrimage to St. George. St. George cures boils and diseases of the eye. He cured my uncle completely. You'll have to show me the way. Katrien. I don't think I can walk ten more hours today. I can see two steeples in the distance. -How far is it? -About two hours. Can you carry on that long? Yes. -Why are you stopping? -I've done something silly. We've come to a stream. -Isn't there a bridge? -I can't see one. -Is the water deep? -I don't think so. Come on, give me your hand. Katrien. -Katrien. -Jan. Jan. Come on. We've never laid like this before. You're so quiet. What will you do with a blind man? The same as with a man who can see. You know very well it's not the same. To me it is. You're young and beautiful. You'd be wasting your life with a wretch. And I'd be wretched without you. I won't be left on the shelf. Do what you like, you won't get rid of me. I will take you by the arm and drag you to the altar. Katrien. I wish I could see you. The misery started the day we drew lots. -If only I could rip it out of my life. -Jan. You're my Jan and the rest doesn't matter. Katrien. We'll throw the baby in the water. Where's the money? There isn't any money. Jan. There's one up there. They're coming up here. Hit them with this when I tell you. Get ready. Jan. Jan. Let's get out of here. There are lots of them. Fransoo is dead. Dammit. The baby, the baby. Get it out of the water. The baby. The baby. They're leaving. Shall we go and beg from the nuns? Imbecile. If we need anything, we'll just take it. Damn, look over there. -That wench that saw us. -With the blind fellow? Let's get out of here before she goes to the gendarmes. But I'll get her. May we, oh Lord, through the power of this mystery be cleansed of our sins and kept safe from our enemies. It's incredibly beautiful here. I've never seen anything like it. And the nuns' clothes are so beautiful. They are giving the poor souls food. There's one covered with boils. The paintings… And all the gold on the altar. It's so beautiful I can't describe it. We dedicate this offering to you, our Lord, that we may attain salvation. Cleanse our souls of unchaste thoughts and keep them pure. Oh merciful God, may this offering save us from our sins and deliver us from all evil. Here is that miraculous statue, Jan, that the bargee's wife told us about. We must pray with all our heart. Let me refresh you. That feels good. -You knew where I was? -I saw you, Katrien. My right eye is not completely dead. That's not true. You're imagining it. I saw you like a shadow in the dark. Maybe it will get better then. Our Lord has answered our prayer. I can't go on, Katrien. I can't walk any more. I keep falling over. There's some shade over there. We have to get there. I can't see a thing. Not a thing. I never will again. What are you doing here? This is private property. What's up with him? That's a job for our doctor. Come with me. -It happened in the army, sir. -Yes, it's the same old story. Hot water and alcohol. Do you know what is wrong with society? No, sir. Things will never go well if reason and intellect are not in charge. The elite, the intelligentsia, the disciples of Montesquieu and Voltaire, they should be in power. That's too scholarly for us. But where are the enlightened leaders? Where is the society where everyone knows his place? The bandages. Philosophers and geniuses like Plato should take charge, they should become general and minister, cardinal and king. We don't understand anything about politics, sir. Do you think his eyes will get better? It will turn out alright. I've seen cases like this before. If you apply regular elder leaf compresses, it will get better. Stupid old fool, you're the doctor now, are you? Get out. You can't read or write. And you're telling us what to do. -What's going on? -I can't do any more for you. Go now. -Where are we? -Near the Western Wood. We're almost there. What's up, Katrien? What's up? -Katrien? -The foot-burners. Keep him there. What are you doing, you bastards? We're people, just like you. No, we're not like you. And you needn't get impatient. I'll describe everything in detail. Don't you worry, soldier. -Her dress is coming off. -It's not true, Jan. It's not true, Jan. -And now her petticoat. -Bastard. She's completely naked, soldier. Have you ever seen her like that? -You can still smell, can't you? -No, no. It's not true, Jan. It's not true. -I'm going to grab her breasts. -It's not true. And her nipples. -And her buttocks. Her ass, soldier. -Bastard. I can see her paradise, soldier. It'll be quiet for a bit now. Jan, darling Jan. It's not true, Jan. It's not true. It's your turn now. Katrien? Katrien? Jan? Jan, we must go on. We can't stay here. No. No. Come on then.
