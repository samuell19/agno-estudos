Smoking and Drinking are injurious to health. Good morning Prasad sir. Good morning Sir. Very good morning. Seems to have come to tell me something , Why should you wait till I ask? Tell me. Water problem sir. Not to me sir, People in the village are suffering for water that’s why what i'm saying. Why need to suffer, Water packets and bottles are being sold even in small shop. Can’t they drink by purchasing them? [ Laughing ] People are dying even to purchasing eatables. Think the Position of poor man even to purchase water. For a vessel of water, they have to walk for two miles. That’s all. Why you are getting worried for that? Do you know how healthy it’s for walking two miles per day? Even diabetes won’t come. On such a serious matter you are.. Prasad sir seems to have gone in good mood. Have you seen kalki? Whatever you are thinking as serious not serious at all. In a small center like our village that big hero movie got released. You saw how people are fighting for ticket, Ticket are being sold in black. Actually entire media's discussing whether this films hit or flop, As if no matter's there. This is seriousness you have seen. Who will read here if you write seriously about and water and fire? If you bring writing on which hero has six-pack, Which heroine exposed? Write on dance steps or cricket cups then we will print. Nowadays people don’t need problems. Just entertainment. You should understand trend kalki. Journalist does not mean not just working for his emotion. Here people will purchase what’s sold and sell whatever can be purchased. To say simply, Papers just business and journalist is just job. I don’t want to do journalist for only getting salary in the first week of the month. Kalki, just one Minute. Can you please send money order to the address given in this? Ok sir. Thank you. What sir? You will send money order every month after getting money. You don't have any family. To where you're sending this money sir? Is it Necessary? Still there are people who wait for that also. Boss, boss! How are you? You can tell some work to me, Instead of doing everything yourself. What you can do? My God! This tea shop work is getting bored. Take me as your informer, You will get thrilled. We will do some adventure. The adventures that i am doing are not enough? You don’t know boss. Someday, I will give super news. You will write that, Then whole state will get shivering. In one stoke we will become Heroes. Another matter boss, That pallathi parvathi is there right? That house on the Ridge. I heard of her marriage, Can I speak to them to have you take photos. Hey! This is reporters camera. Not for marriages and celebrations. You are nice boss, You should learn many things from our village doctor. We have only one doctor in our village for deliveries and leg injuries boss. If it’s city, one doctor for nose and another for anus. Then what to do? You have camera in your hand, You can earn some money if use for marriage and function and you can give something to me as well. You can ask me directly. Thanks boss. - Bye. Shit! The phone is not working. What’s today date? It's 27th daddy. I gave him money to pay phone bill but seems he has not remitted, The phone was cut. Where have you gone? I gone since, pranab mukharji asked to come. What? Is this Sarcastic? What else? Will i roam without having any work? Oh work! I know what your work is about. You just make stand at the panchayat board office to question how mess funds are there and about the roads? That's your only work to raise questions to the panchat officer. Daddy, Shall i serve you more pickle? Welcome to sankham news, First Headlines. While Jana senani pawan Kalyan speaks that I have not come to politics to grab money.

It will be always ahead of critisizing the mistakes of the government. At the same time, It encourages the development activities of government as well. It will be ahead in the process of reaching government schemes to public. I'm taking leave by requiring all your support and help. Hello sir, I'm kalki. Ok get in the car, We will discuss while travelling. - Ok sir. Yes tell me. Sir I’m working as strineer since five years. - Ok. I want to come to Hyderabad and work with you sir. I choose journalism as a career with the aim of doing work, which benefits people. That too, I like investigative journalism so much sir. But there’s not that much scope for that here sir. Somehow you have to help me in this regard sir. Why do you need to come to Hyderabad for that? Then what will be here sir? Except soil. [ Laughing ] Where there’s soil, there will be people. Good will be there, where people are there. If you can see perfectly there cheating will be there. Hyderabad may be better to invest money But not to investigate people. Who will be think of people here? When intelligent people like you goes to Hyderabad and Mumbai. That’s why, You be here and do good investigative journalist here. Where ever Sun there, He won’t stop enlighting. You should come with good sensational news. Wishing you to get such a news. When you get such news, Call me directly. - Ok sir. Yes one minute, what is your name again? - Yes Kalki sir. Yes Kalki, All the best. - Thank you sir. Driver. What man? Have you fixed auspicious time? Yes, Come kalki. This fellow is my nephew, Which I have been telling before. He grown up since his childhood with us. He and geetha was grown up like brother and sister. We will go sir. - It’s pleasure. Namasthe. Uncle, what’s all this? Engagement to geetha marriage. I said I will marry her. I also thought of it but whatever we expect, It won't happen right? That's why like this.. - Uncle. As your uncle i'm telling you this. I have been waiting for you to change and become supportive to my daughter. Since your way is different and won’t come into our way That's why I’m showing a way to her. Even I sell your six acres, money is not enough for her dowry. That’s why, I agreed lending of that farm to Reddy. What’s this uncle? Having said she will be given to me for marriage Now will you marry her to someone by selling my farm money. That means are you making me fool in the middle - Brother in law. That land was given by your mother and father I have raised you without any insufficiency. Not that you have done any insufficiency to me but Why are you doing this much of injustice to me? Not her to get injustified? Geetha, Tell him geetha. What to say brother in law? I will do that marriage only. What are you talking geetha? Then what about our love? I really like you brother in law But not have an intention to live entire life like this. Then all that.. - Let's go brother in law. Brother in law, Have you got mad? Did you drive me mad or You are mad? Why did you agreed for this marriage? Why because it’s better to marry that engineer instead of you. See, How are we looking when standing side by side. We both are not correct brother in law, Think practically. Then what about our mingled hearts and bodies? It’s enough, Stop brother in law. No need to shout loud like it was a big thing. Yes, I slept with you, Then what now? Then i had that opportunity and i did it. But they are just experiences only, Remember them as my memories. Uncle, It seems there is no need for me to be in this house uncle. If you say like that, Do you think that I will beg you to stay. Ok, I'm going. [ No audio ] [ No audio ] Excuse me, This address? Anyway,Who are you? What’s your work with him? If you tell this address then I will go, I have some urgent works. Hello,wait wait, I'm kalki. You are searching for me only. This is my card. Please sit. My village is ramapuram, which is ten kilometers from here. Since last three or four years public were dying with severe unhealthy problems there. My father too expired recently with kidney problem. The essesnce is reduced in the crop fields and Even animals were dying by drinking water of the place. This matter was brought to the notice of officials numbers of times but there is no use. Since, it’s a far away village, Press peoples don’t took care of in this area. You are the only one person in this place, Who writes useful matter about public. That’s why, I'm searching for you. You see, I don’t know how many people get benefit from the news i write. But believing me you came all the way,So I will come with you. Now, are there any buses to your village? - No. Ok, You stay here. - Ok. My bike is there in the office nearby, I will go and bring it. Good morning. - Good morning. Take a bath and come fast, In the mean time I will get ready tiffin. Come. Seems it better to enquire going into the village. That’s what i'm also thinking. how do we start? We have to see entire village once, Water resources,Tube wells and Everything. And also, We should know the details of people who died recently with symptoms of skin diseases, kidney problems and cancer. But as you are new to this village, Will they tell the details if you ask? That’s also one point. Do one thing. You go and ask. - Ok. From where we will start ? First of all, If we ask the family members of those deceased people. Then you go and ask. Ok. [ No audio ] [ No audio ] [ No audio ] Maya, Look at this. As per the details we collected, House of deceased people are this side of village. All this people depends for water on the adjacent canal. Many people died in those houses only. That means in your view, Is there any relation water and these things. - May be. Is there any factory ahead of this place? Yes. There is one chemical factory. - Yes. Definitely, Water would have got polluted because of result of that factory. Still, We can’t say anything without testing the water. My uncle works in water works department in town. Is it? Then we will ask for him advice. When will we go to him? He will come to meet me every Sunday, Tomorrow is sunday so, he will come. Oh! very good. All our doubts will be clarified tomorrow. [ Laughing ] Are all these necessary to us? That village people will doubt you, If they know that you Collected samples. If you go that factory side, MP's people will take our your lifes. Somehow you are talking so much of risk. Certainly risk But.. - Inevitable sir. We are taking risk for there sake only. - Ok. Do as your wish. But village people will have so many concerns, Be careful. - Ok sir. All the required material is in the bag, If you collect samples and give me. Then i will give report after getting tested in lab. Ok sir. Ok, Bye. - Ok. [ No audio ] That was the factory i'm talking about. - Oh. Ok,Then we will go. - It might be risk?

I don’t now what i will do, if you are in front me for a minute, Get him out. Smoking and Drinking are injurious to health. [ Indistinct chattering ] Is this tea stall or Tv stall? The tea stall with the Tv brother. I came here to drink tea for my headache but it was increasing,Turn off that TV. TV is the original look for my tea stall uncle. Today Dhoni is hitting a lot of sixes right? All the villages struggling with the work that kalki has done but you're calculating the runs here. Look at the news in the paper. Kalki wrote all the false news. He is got beaten bad, When he went to sankham office in Hyderabad. He took the bribe and wrote the news. Bloody rascal. Kalki is not that type of person brother. Kalki brother would never have done such a thing. If he has not done anything wrong then why didn't he come to our village yet. He who deceives us will die miserably, Bloody rascal. If he comes here, I will kill him. What do you want? - I want to meet uncle. Whose uncle,your uncle or my uncle? Uncle...Yes, Gopalam lab incharge. Sir, He wants to meet lab incharge Gopalam. Gopalam?Lab? There is no such thing here. We just collect the samples and send them to the headquarters but Venkata Rao in charge of it not gopalam. So that... He ruined our lifes by writing false news. You made us sell all our farms, you.. - Brother. Please listen to me. - What do you say? Hey! Don't leave him beat him until he dies. Uncle, don't you believe me too? Really, I have not done any wrong uncle. Uncle? If you call me one more time, I will kill you. Not that uncle..Just listen to me. - What do you say? My daughter's marriage failed because you are my nephew. Unable to bear that humiliation, My daughter attempted suicide. - Shit! A man like you is the same whether he die or alive, Get lost. He is not a common man, He cheated us all along with his family. Let's not leave him normally. Let's beat him together. - Brother don't beat him, no brother. Kill him. Kill him, If you think killing kalki will solve your problem then kill him. It is true that you have been injusticed. If Kalki had really done something wrong, He would not come back to you and no matter how much you hit, He won't try to explain everything. When you're walking two miles for a little water he can't see your trouble and kalki wrote your pain as a news. Kalki wanted to make a name for himself as a reporter. I cannot believe that such kalki have deceived you There was a conspiracy behind this. I believe in kalki and you believe in me. Let’s give Kalki a chance to prove himself. Let us do justice to all, Come kalki. Really, I have not done any wrong sir. - I know kalki. I want to prove that I was not wrong. To Prove that the basis is maya. But now maya is missing sir. I don't understand what happened to her. Maya cheated on you. Do you know who is maya? Maya is ramarao's daughter. Sit. You said that you will agree that i'm your daughter. - Yes. I have a trip to America during this week When will you agree that I am your daughter in public? I used to had a doubt. But you are definitely my daughter because you loved and cheated an innocent guy. Dad? I am a father who does not admit that you are my daughter My work is finished with you. Now if I admit that you are my daughter for your need All I have done so far will be waste. What do you mean? You trapped kalki because of me. He will be in the same trap until you are not seen as maya. Now if you or our relationship goes public, It becomes an advantage to kalki. So, You go to America silently and take as much as money you want. You know I’m very generous. - You know I didn’t do this work for money. I do any work for money, Even loving and cheating on your mom also. I wanted to tell you as a father to the world, For that I was ashamed of myself. I'm also feeling ashamed because it's compulsory. This is survival. I will not leave this country because i cheated an innocent guy for a cheater like you. I will go public with all your facts. Hey! Go quickly, She shouldn't escape from us. Oh! Oh my God! Let's go. Kalki. You made a lot of poor people suffer out there and pretend you're suffering here. I lose people who loved me because of you. The whole career that i dreamed of was ruined. Why do you now have the pain that you did not have when you and your father suffered the villages together. Tell me. Why did you do all these things? I did all these things to avoid suffering in my future. I have deceived you, knowing that I am deceiving you. Maya. My name is not Maya, It's Bhavana. How much longer Uncle? After finishing studies he said that he would agree me as his daughter. The words of the elders are like writing on water Let him stand on his word, if he is actually a human being. I’m bhavana. - Tell me bhavana. You said that you will accept me as your daughter after i finish my education. - I'm going to Ravulapalem today, Let's talk there Thank you dad.. Sorry sir. Uncle, He asked me to come to Ravulapalem. This site is total 40 thousand acres At least we should have 25 thousand acres in it right? No sir, Those are well cultivated lands. No one is interested in selling them and we cannot forced to take it because of your media. It's media work to stop, That's why we would do that by using the media. How? If we want them all to sell their farms, We have to mentally fear them. We must make true the lie that they all afraid. People do not believe what politicians say. The media should say it. - That's why you all created your own newspapers. Businesses are for your profits and newspapers are for your promotions. That is also a Business. - Yes. It is business to deceive the people by making them trusting us. Sir, Someone named bhavana has come to meet you. Tell her to sit in the next room. Sir was in the meeting and asked you to wait. It's ok, Thank you. Let's all believe and make a lie come true. Through our paper everyone should believe that and sell their farms. We have to tell them a terrible lie and made them believe it. I will think of something. I'll tell you what to do after the newspaper edition opening. Until then we should not do any work that comes to public attention. I'm talking to you. Did you understand? Sit,sit. How are you? What about your studies? I’m fine and studying good. I raised you as an orphan. Now, you have risen to the level where you can stand on your own. I’m happy. You said, You want my name but not my property, I like it. Ok, Do as you like. But you have to do onething for me. What should I do? [ No audio ] To come outside from a situation to call my own father as daddy. And to get respect in the society. I did this for my selfishness. But.. I loved you so much, when I see you commitment in yourself kalki. It is true that I deceived you but my love is not a lie. I will do whatever you say to correct my mistake. Ok, let's kill ramarao, Will you come? Let’s go. No kalki. - Don't stop me sir. The solution to this problem is to let a man like Rama Rao die. Killing people will increases the problem but no solution can be found kalki. He is not only a cheater but also a monster who kills his own daughter. He should not be alive, It is correct to kill him. No kalki, Thoughtless rage has no meaning. I have to kill hundreds of people, if i want to kill everyone who has done injustice. We need an idea but not anger. I was also a victim of injustice. I also started a magazine for backward races. I wanted to light up people's lives with that magazine but i sold it because I’m unable continue that. I also saw a lot of grief, As the owner of the magazine I have to feed food for ten people. My whole body crumbled when i went to work near someone for a little food. I have seen somepeople doing broker work under newspaper and selling people's trust. I'm watching many, many more things silently. I have seen myself in you after i saw you and your ambition. My life has no meaning, If i remain silent after watching your courage and those people sadness. From now my experience should be thought and your weapon should be practical. I will not put blood stains on that weapon kalki. Let's fill the martial conch on Shankam and use the pen as a weapon and fight. Win, we will definitely win. Cheers - Cheers. Touch one glass with another glass and drink it, You will get a good pleasure. If we touch one glass with another glass and drink it It will be a good pleasure, You know that right? If you do not touch the glass with glass, The evil in you will remains with you. [ Laughing ] [ Mocking ] What do you mean sir? It means light and venu. I like to him like that Is this light is his surname? At that time, He started a magazine called Velugu to fill light in the life of the people. He stopped completely because he was unable to continue the magazine. He remained like this. Even the magazine is gone I think the surname of the velugu is there, It’s very funny. Hey! Satthi Serve him the alcohol. I don’t need that, I'm already intoxicated. We didn't expect you to be coming at this time. - I expected that you will do this. When you unnecessarily started a magazine in our area I expected something to happen, when you get along well with each other. I also expected that there is conspiracy behind this When you published news on kalki without invoving me. I have come to question for the injustice,You have done to the ideals of Kalki believers. See here. I have said the same thing to many people. I'm telling you the same thing again. You see the sun right, What is his work? He wakes up during the day,does his work himself and rising down in the evening. He will not come to earth and ask no one why you did that? Do you know why? If he questions, He will not be able to rise tomorrow. If the sun opens its eyes, microbes like you will not be there. People being silent does not mean that they do not speak People are quiet which means don’t think they are afraid of noise. The noise becomes a war if they start talking and The war is like the battle of the ants who bites the snake. That battle is like a battle in which the wolf is driven away. - No. You can’t fight except making noise. Ramarao, If you have paper in your hand, You're thinking the power is with you. You have only paper but the pens that run it are in the hands of a journalist like us. We mixed all pens like you into the land. we will buy and sell anyone to undermine people like you. The time is near when people like you who do not know the difference between mother and business. I used to use the pen as a pen.

Again I am reminded of the days when we all worked together. I think you read about the person who took the first interview of Kondapalli Sitaramaiah the founder of the secretive Naxalites. He is also one revolution. - Hello. I heard a lot about you sir, I'm so proud to meet you. - Thank you. She has revealed the name of the adoption of the children’s kidnapping. The government has radically changed this adoption policy because of the story she wrote. Each one of the people here is a revolution. The Eluru scheme and the land scandal are sensational in the history of Andhra Pradesh journalism. These people sacrificed their lives for the real news at the right time. I saw our struggle in kalki consciousness. I called you all that if we all join together, kalki ambition and journalism both will win. We had to fight again. Fight ? Fight with whom? and Why is this fight? Against Rama Rao. Against the deception he has done to the people Against the deception he has committed to our journalism. When there were four magazines, The magazine turned into a business. 20 magazines and 60 Channels, All are tracts, Not newspapers. Why? What do we need sir? If we don't help, He's ready to fight with gun. We have all come to this field because the word is much stronger than the gun. You know what he can do, if we go against Rama Rao He will destroy all of us and make our living without life. What was his level in the past? Did you forget about that? Have you forgotten the effort we put into working hard for our cause? Have you forgotten the fact that we dreamed the magazine should be on the side of the people? What happened to your rage? Remember the past once. Remember Inspirations, Don’t forget the theories that invoked us in those days. Hey! raghava, My word is armed, and my throat letter is great What happened to your poems that you wrote saying this is my heartbeat? I remember everything, I also remember the magazine you started called Light at the expense of your property. I also remembers the hard work we put in for it, But what happened in the end? Journalism is a challenge. No matter how many difficulties are in this profession and ministers threatens us because this is our livelihood. The pen is our life,The camera is our eye Our journey on the hedgehog trail. Hope is our lifeblood. Man cannot live without breath which means we cannot live without reporting. Yes. Our minds may be buried but we are still left with wounds. Our rage has life and our thinking has meaning, Justice wants us. We need to meet to open the blindfolds of the goddess of justice.

Venu sir, what's going on here ? Cool my dear friend cool. We put on this press meet to tell you all in detail. First of all good morning to all. His name is kalki. I Know,He was the one who wrote the false news and convinced the people in the village. Is it because of this fraud that our media reputation has been tarnished? - No sir. No sir, I'm not a cheater, I'm also a journalist like you. I wanted to do journalism with values so, I wrote it. That means you are justifying yourself by writing false news and creating fake news. Is it true that you deceive innocent people unjustly? It is true that I wrote the news that there was a problem with the water in that village. But the reports that I have chemicals in water are not true. How can you prove that? Uncle.. Hello everyone. Who is he? His name is Sitaram, When he said that he was working in research lab I took the samples I had collected and gave them to him. Why did you do that? To deliberately misled kalki? You don’t know that changing reports like that is a crime? I'm not working in any lab. I had to cheat kalki with the encouragement of a magazine officer. I gave that fake report to kalki, This is true. Who is the head of the magazine? Who is behind this scam? My magazine MD Rama Rao. These mistakes seem to be telling the names of the big ones to prove that you are not your partner of this scam. No, no it’s true. What happened? Tell us in detail. [ No audio ] In that way they used us to deceive all the villagers and occupy their places. Friends. Not only this crime, He has committed a lot of crimes over the last 25 years based on the magazine. He earned hundreds of crores of money from many poor people with his political reputation and his own magazine reputation. He sacrificed the lives of many innocent people. Do you know what it means to be sacrificed life? Do you know how difficult it is for the poor to meet their hunger and needs? I will show you today. Lacchavva. Come come,Tell them all about the injustice that has happened to you. Tell them, You don't need to afraid of anything. Hello everyone. My name is lachavva. These three are my children. My house in Gajulapally outside Hyderabad. I had a five acres of land in past. My husband and I used to stay there and farm. I do not know what actually happened that time One day some big officer's came to our village in cars and jeeps. They told to me something like sites and sez. They didn't listen to our words. They took our fingerprints telling that, They will give lakhs of money to us. After 3 days they took all our lands and drove us out of there. Thinking it would be difficult to survive without land. My husband drank endrin and died. [ Crying ] My husband died of anguish that the land had been grabbed. But they wrote that he died with a stomach ache. I could not bear these hardships and I thought I would also drink poison and die. I am alive for my children that they will be orphaned if i die. [ Crying ] Not only this women,There are many people who have suffered like this. We can’t replace that. Thousands of acres in the name of the sez and thousands of acres donated to coastal. These are not only government lands, It also includes public lands We write in the newspaper that the government will compensate the people who lost their land, Do we really know how much they give? Did you know about those who asked the same thing? Has anyone campaigned on this topic? Did any channel telecasted about these murders? The existence of those in question is becoming questionable Those who have strength will have a stronger life. Is this sovereignty? Is this equal justice? See here, Shooting at a celebrity house and getting stuck in a celebrity drugs racket. Abuse of power, misuse of funds, genocide by the son of a minister, rape by the son of an MLA. Deception and tyranny. Frauds,atrocities, murders, scandals,Hundreds of such news can only be seen today, It will disappear tomorrow. Have any of you ever wondered why that news will disappear tomorrow? Because on the same day that such news is published in a magazine money is deposited in the bank account of a magazine owner like Rama Rao. That money swallows that news,that money hides that news. Thus that news disappears in the Morning Papers and in the News Channel. Does any one of us have the time to think about the news that has disappeared? Is there anyone among us, who asks what happened to that case? They made the no difference between a used condom and a dated paper. Hey! stop that live. - Sir. I don't know what you will do,Stop that live first, Go - Ok sir. If one moment passes this moment will either become a past. But Yesterday's truth in a day will not be tomorrow false sir. I am Rama Rao PA. Live should stop immediately. Those who do business come into politics and rule people. If they stand on the road holding the mouth of truth, we all become like dumb. We have become like the blind people who have it all. What, what is this? Sir, some channels are not picking the call. I don’t know you should stop this immediately, Go. - Ok sir. Go. Yes, the movement in us stopped, Life has stopped in us. We have all become lifeless. Those who rule will harass more people if the people who don’t care about society. Those who need the question are being unfair to the people because the magazine is on the side of the leaders. People, magazines, rulers everyone need to change. The power to change people and rulers lies in journalism alone. They stopped the live telecasting on channels. Kalki, Where are you going? What happened? - They stopped the live telecasting on channels sir. Did you see this? They stopped the live telecasting on channels. Nearly 25 channels were telecasted this live. Some news channels stopped live because they could not bear the fact that we were talking. Nearly two to three channels are telecasting this show. That means we can clearly understand, who is on the side of the people and who is side on the culprits. Are you understanding, one of the irregularities committed by Rama Rao as the head of a magazine. The fall of Rama Rao as a man is another. A direct example of this is bhavana. Bhavana. She is bhavana. Hello. - Sit. Once upon a time I was very interested in being called Rama Rao’s daughter. But now i'm feeling ashamed to say that i'm his daughter. I thought he would not accept me as his daughter for his dignity. But.. But he is a bloodthirsty villain, He thought he should kill me badly himself even i'm his own daughter. Rama rao down down, Sankham down down. [ People shouting ] Hey! rama rao. Rama rao come outside. Come out, if you have the courage You said the power is in your hands if you have the magazine. Come out, if you really have the courage. [ People shouting ] You said that you put the magazine on the foundations of values. Where are your values? Today people come to move your values, Come outside. Do you think the truth will be hidden if you stop live? You once sent me out of this magazine office because of the values. Now, i'm not a reporter if you are not moved from the same magazine office to jail. Venu. You have damaged my reputation, which i have been protecting from many years. You damaged my magazine dignity. I will save it anyway. But no one can save your life. Run away, run anywhere. Wherever you are, I will kill you in 24 hours. [ Laughing ] Ramarao. Can i tell you something? Every time I lose,I felt sad why am i still alive? But, Now i understood. That i am alive to win. I lost in life.But did not flee. Remember, Tomorrow i'm going to light up the lives of these people. I will drive out your dark realm and fill the dawn. Stop me, if you have dare. [ Indistinct chattering ] Narayana. How are you? It's been a long time since I've seen you. Are you fine? - Good. The dishes are doing well and we will eat right here today. - It’s too happy to me. [ laughing ] What is this narayana? Why is this mother? Many evil eyes have fallen on you that's way I'm doing this. What is this my friend? He is my friend narayana. - Hello sir. He is kalki. You're looking very energetic. - Thank you sir. What nayak? - Hello sir. Are you fine? - Yes sir. Hello sir. - Hello, hello. What about you? - Hello sir. Are you fine? - Yes sir. He told me that you are also a reporter. But in this place.. Should the reporter not support the public though? What is the relation between the people and this food? I'm a reporter kalki. But we should help the poor people. I didn't get it sir. At the time, I wrote many reports asking for help for orphans and handicapped people. I asked many to help. They did not help and everyone was shocked to think yes but no one helped. I could not take care of this alone, One day I said the same thing to venu. Then venu told me that if you have a loving mind to help people, works will come of their own. If it's done alone, it becomes a job but If ten people do it together, it becomes a revolution. Venu said that from now on, I will send you my salary and he is sending his salary money every month. Now, it’s fun. Super sir. - Yeah, it is good. I think everything is in there. - You too cook sir. Me? - Yes, it will be nice. Please cook sir, pleae. - Ok, ok just wait. What's going on narayana? Did you tell him the total story? - Yes. They are all asking me to cook, Do you have the courage to eat? Sir,Do you cook? - He is expect in cooking. He make dishes very well. - You're expecting more from me. Ok,ok. Hey! narayana. Mallya will be waiting there. It is already too late, Please make it quickly, Let's go. Pack up everything, make everything ready, Let's go. Ready, lift this. - Son. What mother? Anything you want to tell me? No son. - It's ok, tell me mother. I want to give you this. - Why is this mother? I saw you in TV, when you're talking. You said that you will light up people lives like me, That's why I'm giving this to you. Start a new magazine again. You are the one who illuminates the lives of people and you can remove people's problems. You can light up the lives of people like me son. Sir. Yes, Bhavana. - Like you said, we reached to the center kalki. Now, How should I come? - You stay there, I will come and pick you up. Ok. Ok, Do one thing. We are going there, You come there and join us. - Ok sir. Ok,Bye. Hi mallanna,How are you? - Hello sir. Hello mother. - Hello sir. I'm fine, You're all fine right? Dheeranna, How is you health? - Good brother. Mallanna, How are you? Are you angry on me? I will not talk to you. - Why angry on me? Why didn't you come to see me all these days? Oh! Do you know how busy I am mallannna? That's why today, I will feed you rice. I don’t have anyone. - Hey! Never make the mistake of thinking that you still have no one. If you don't have anyone then what about us? We are for you and you are for us. From now, I will feed you rice every day. We are like a family mallanna. Hey! give me water. Don’t worry, Drink. Brother. Oh my God! Don't hit him. Brother.. Let's go. Brother.. Brother, Brother.. Brother, Brother.. [ Hiccups ] [ Hiccups ] Brother.. Brother.. Brother.. Kalki. Don’t feel sad. who loves the truth must walk on fire. He who loves life must see death. Don't cry. Do not be discouraged by watching these two eyes closed. Think of the thousands of people waiting for light. You give them new light in thier lifes. From now,This pen is your friend. Brother.. Oh God! Oh! I came here very curious take a last look. But I was not that lucky. I brought the wreath to the corpse. I was a little late. Good wreath. Veerayya, what’s we do this wreath? Come here. Let's give this to kalki. [ Laughing ] Hey! You wanted to show media power, But i showed the power of money. You wanted to get the news on 10 channels But I gave money to all of them and shut their mouths. You wanted to be in your news by two magazines But I was prove by twenty magazines that you are the idiot. Anyway what happened now? Some of the people you want are dead. Professionally, you are almost dead. Yet people tend to forget the old news when the new one comes. They have a short term memory more than Ghajini. Inquiry matter undertaken by the Government has no address. I told him that i would take your life in 24 hours because you took away my dignity and i did it. I killed him 24 hours before after you did such a big press meet and removed my reputation, I made sure the media did not get involved. That is my power. You are doing a mistake. You are making a big mistake. You made a mistake and you took the first step to mistake. You killed our venu sir and ruined the lives of so many innocent people Because you believe that no one can do anything for you. But it will only work for you, when it is within four walls of your office. See, what happens when you get into the people's land. No,no, Don't do anything to me. Come on, Kill him, hit him. ♪ Man is born in land and meets again in land ♪ ♪ Look and live like the crocodile mind ♪ ♪ Leave those who have deceived you and boldly face the circumstances you have to face ♪ ♪ The whole world is like a maze ♪ ♪ Get ready for battle and ring the war bell ♪ ♪ Become Arjuna and receive success, You must die if you become abhimanya ♪ ♪ You will succeed if you are brave enough to face the time or you will fail, if you are afraid of the time ♪ ♪ We must bravely resist and destroy the bad guys in the world ♪ ♪ Strategy ♪ ♪ Strategy ♪ ♪ Strategy ♪
