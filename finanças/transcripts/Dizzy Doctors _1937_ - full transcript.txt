Look at me, every morning, wide-awake at 11:00. I'm awake. How about you? I'm awake, but I can't get my eyes open. Ow. Thanks. Hey, how about some breakfast? Yeah, how about some breakfast? Yeah, how about--? Oh, no man again. Come on, get breakfast. Oh, I don't know why we got married. Why can't our wives get our breakfast? Our wives can't get breakfast and work at the same time. [SNORING] [EXHALING] [SHIVERS] Come and get it. [CLANGING] Come and get it. Mm. What's that you got? Cheese. Cheese? That's soap. I thought it tastes kinda strong. [RINGS] [SNORES] [EXHALES] [HONKS] [SNORES] [EXHALES] [PEEPS] Oh, I don't know what they're trying to hide. Those loafers are still in bed. They must have sleeping sickness. I'll get 'em up.

Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. I'm sick and tired of you lying around the house doing nothing but eating and sleeping all day. And I haven't had a new dress since we've been married. Well, we're only married 5 years. Yes, and either you get out and get a job or I'll get a divorce. Oh, honey, not that. We looked for a job one day last year, there isn't any. There's one right here. There is? What's it say? "Wanted: Salesmen to sell Brighto." Well, we don't know anything about sellin'. If you don't get that job you're gonna get out of this house and never come back again. And that goes for you too, you weasel-faced porcupine. I know, that goes for me too. That goes for all of you, you sleeping hyenas. Wait a minute, honey, we'll go out and get this job even if it kills us. Come on, fellas. Now, give us a kiss and wish us luck. Hey. Hey. The hats. Keep a cool head, naturally. I've advertised for salesmen in every newspaper in town, and not even one single applicant. Well, since prosperity's back everybody's working. Well, it doesn't seem possible. Surely there's someone I can get. Someone must sell this product. I've got to have salesmen. Salesmen. I think we're being paged. Come on. Salesmen, that's what I need. Salesmen. Here we are. Three of the best salesmen that ever saled. Have you ever sold anything? Have we ever sold anything? Have we ever sold anything? Have we? Ooh, ooh! Hello. [LAUGHS] Well, this, gentlemen, is Brighto. STOOGES: Yes. The savior of a nation. Yes, yes. The scientific marvel of the age. No. Yes. Brighto makes old bodies new. Brighto, Brighto, makes old bodies new. We'll sell a million bottles. Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. STOOGES [SHOUTING]: Brighto, Brighto, Brighto. Brighto, Brighto, Brighto. Brighto, Brighto, Brighto. Brighto, Brighto, Brighto. Brighto, Brighto, Brighto. Brighto. [MUTTERS] STOOGES: Brighto, Brighto, Brighto. LARRY: Get your Brighto here. Brighto. Brighto, Brighto. Hey, what's this stuff for anyway? Why, it's a cleaner, ya chump. I know, it's auto polish. You boys really wanna know what it's for? Yeah. Yeah. It's for sale. Now, get busy sellin' it. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Right this way, folks, the best auto polish on the market. Brighto, cleans and polishes right away. Brighto? Mister, can I rub a little of this on your body? You just try it if you want a good punch in the nose. [BARKS LIKE DOG] [HISSES] Remember the name, boss, Brighto. You'll never forget it as long as you live. Neither will I. Hey, you. Here we are, ladies and gentleman just to advertise the world's greatest and fastest cleaner on the market. How 'bout a bottle? Will that stuff clean furniture? I'll say it'll clean furniture. I'll try a bottle. Thank you, sir. You'll never regret it. There they go, satisfied customers by the thousand. Hey, how about--? Listen, you can't sell that stuff out here with-- Oh, I'm sorry, buddy, I didn't notice the leg was gone. Huh? Oh, yeah. Gone but not forgotten. Yeah, war, eh? No, banana peel. Could I sell you a bottle of this Brighto? I just found out it cleans Panama hats and furniture. Also, if you have a knickknack with a nick in it, we'll knock the nick out of the knickknack with Brighto. Dr. Bright said-- What's the matter? I think I got somethin'. Or something's got me. [GROWLS] No. Can I get you somethin'? A glass of water maybe? No, I'll be all right. I just get nervous like this before I make a sale. [RIPS] There, I guess that's over. Say, you better let me take the spot off your coat. Spot? Yes. Where? Oh, Brighto is marvelous. It'll take it off in a jiffy. Well, great. I got a spot over here too. Yeah, we'll get to that in a second. Is it gone? In just another-- I'll say it's gone. Good, give me a bottle of that stuff. What? Ooh. Come back here, you. Halt. Halt. [MOANS] Brighto? Brighto? Brighto? Want a ride? No, want to buy a bottle of Brighto? No. Then I'll take a ride. [LAUGHS] Hey, wait a minute, turn around quick. Hey, stop. Wait a minute. Well, what's the matter? Nothin'. This is as far as I go. Ooh. [WHIMPERS] [WHIMPERS] Come here, killer. Where's the other chucklehead? There's a customer, hurry up. Hey, mister, polish your car with Brighto? Makes old bodies new. No, I just had it washed and polished. They gave you a bad job. Let's polish him up and surprise him anyhow. Certainly. After we shine it, he won't even recognize it. Come on, make it snappy. [HUMMING HIGH-PITCHED] Hey, this car sure is dirty. I hope it's dirt. It looks like the paint's comin' off. [HUMMING] Hey, this stuff's takin' the paint off. Police. Police. Help, police. Help, police. Ah. If I ever catch you guys again, I'll tear you limb from limb. Well, boys, how did you do? We almost got pinched. Yeah, we rubbed it on a man's car, took the paint right off. That polish ain't no good. Polish? You idiots. That's medicine. Medicine, oh. Ah. I feel better already. What was wrong with you? Nothin'. Ow. You're fired, the three of you. Get out. Oh, wait a minute, boss. If we lose this job we lose our homes. I don't care if he-- Oh, boss, give us another chance. Come on, just one more chance. Yeah, be a regular guy. You got a kind face. Aw, please. Oh, it's a matter-- It's a matter of life and death. I didn't know it was medicine. All right, uh-- I'll give you another chance. All three of us? Yes. That's three more chances, boys. Come on. Well, I tell ya, they ruined my car. Yes, but look what they did to my uniform arm. I want-- Oh, let's go. [SQUEALS] There they are. Quick, in the truck. In the truck. Okay, boys, the coast is clear. Come on. We sure gave those guys the slip. Brighto? Quiet. Look, there must be plenty of sick people in here. That's just the place to sell medicine. Come on. Ready, heave ho. Turn right at the next corner. LARRY: Right. MOE: Right. Right. Right. [WHEELS SQUEAL] Ow. Ooh. What's the idea of going through a boulevard stop? Look at our fender. Where's your license? Why don't you say somethin'? That's enough. Just as I thought, drunk driving. Give him a ticket. One-way or roundtrip? Make it a one-way rountrip-- What do you want? WOMAN [OVER PA]: Calling Dr. Jones. Calling Dr. Jones. Hey, it's down there. Calling Dr. Jones. Calling Dr. Jones. Report to Room 329. [PHONE RINGS] Yes? Yes, yes? Yes? What is it? A man wants to know what to do for inflammation. Why call us? Tell him to dial information. You heard it. [LOUDLY OVER PA] Quiet, we're on the air. [PLAYS CHORD] Ooh. Shh. Hello, everybody. We just brought the moon over the mountain. Hello, Ma, hello, Pa. It wasn't much of a fight. I stood like that... but not for long. I-- Quiet.

How about you? Shh. Don't wake him. He's been asleep 87 days. Hm, what a catnap. See if he's playin' possum. You know, they will do that once in a while. [HEARTBEAT, INTERMITTENT BUZZING] Hm.

Oh. Get out. Don't worry, pal. All you need is a treatment of Brighto. Yeah, pick a number from one to 10. Two. Two bottles, boys. Right. Two bottles, right. [HUMMING HIGH-PITCHED] You'll never be troubled with dandruff again. Or hair either. Ah. Oh, you look much better. [SNAPS] This is the place. We'll see the head guy. He'll probably buy our whole stock. Why didn't you think of that? Why didn't you think of that? [MOANS] Come on. Yes, but-- There's no buts about it. I'm the boss of this hospital-- Say, boss, we got an article here-- Just a second. Okay. And another thing-- Say, --you fellas know-- what's all the fuss? We're in a hurry. [GLASS CLINKING] Quiet.
