No, Your Honor. Not this time. Look at me. I can stand. You said you would pray for me. Allah has heard your prayers. Hear your own prayers. I thank you. It's the least I can do. The situation is critical. The Patriarch loves him. And the people of Egypt love him. We have to find a way. Our lives are at stake. Don't you think you're a bit over the top? No, we must not risk him becoming a Patriarch. He is not suitable for the position. He will give the last penny to the Arabs and the beggars! Nothing will be left! Maybe he's kindhearted and all that... but he is definitely crazy. A fanatic, I would say. I'm not sure about his goodness. He is a hypocrite. Remember his "thank you" at the banquet? Which "thank you"? This "thank you". "Your Eminence, we only want you as our next Patriarch! We only want you, Your Honor! Thank you!" Thank God you're not an actor. He hangs out with prostitutes on the streets. The Patriarch will not like this. Metropolitan Nektarios... he is a spiritual child of the Patriarch. He created him. We need something more important... to persuade him to turn against him. It won't be easy. Things are easier than you make them out to be. Patriarch Sophronios... He was the Patriarch of Constantinople before becoming Patriarch of Alexandria. He was expelled after three years because of some disturbance. He claims he was betrayed... from someone who was close to him. He trembles lest he lose his place again. He will not risk it at all in this case. Are we talking about my child, Nektarios? Is he the one you say is plotting against me? I'm sorry, Your Holiness, but he's the one we're talking about. I know it's hard to believe it's Judas, but it's true. It's not hard for me to believe. This place is full of... Jews! Your Holiness... we suggest you never see or speak to him again. I want to be alone. We are trying to protect you. Go outside! All of you! Outside! Gorgeous, isn't it? Indeed. Thanks to you. Thank God, Mina. Excuse me, Your Honor... but you know my opinion on that. Have faith. With so much injustice and poverty... it is hard to have faith. You're right. There is much injustice and suffering. But that's exactly why I think our life here... she is not the only one there. I have some faith thanks to you. Is true; Have you been relieved of your duties? We won't allow it. They have no right to act without asking us. Shame on them! Please, let's keep calm. I'm sure things will work out. Don't worry, Your Honor. We have more influence on the Egyptian government... from them. We financially support the Patriarchate. If they don't answer us why they fired you... we will demand that Patriarch Sophronios be deposed... and put yourself in his place. I must speak to the Patriarch first. He brought me to Egypt and ordained me Metropolitan. I am sure he will accept me. - Please don't worry. - What happens; I know that the Holy One is here. I'd like to see him, please. He is here, but he is terribly ill. I have to see him. May I help you, Your Honor? I must speak to Patriarch Sophronius, please. The Holy Father does not want to see you. I don't believe that. Why don't you believe it? Did you not receive an official letter from him? The letter does not state the nature of my crime. I was convicted without a trial. Without a chance to defend myself. I deserve to know why. Why; For reasons known to us. No! No! We want our priest! Your Honor... from the Patriarchate. I thank you. Please... stay. It's not good news... is not that right; No. What do they want from you now? They want me to leave Egypt. That's why I question God. Never doubt God, Mina. They certainly do not believe in Him. Please don't say such things. They want you to leave Egypt... because they fear that there will be an upheaval. The people will demand from the government... I don't want anything like that to happen, am I understood? But why, Your Honor? I am not going to do anything that will harm Father Sophronius. Father? After what he did to you? I can't argue with him. Need to go. Very quickly and quietly. No fuss, Mina. Keep the faith, Mina. Thank you, Your Honor. Your decision to leave Egypt hurt us deeply... and it moved us terribly. We consider your removal an irreparable loss. The church of Alexandria... it lacks one of its truly distinguished hierarchs. We were very upset by your departure... because we feel empty in our hearts. We consider your deprivation a great moral loss. Please do not exclude us from your prayers... but remember us. Your friend who loved you... and wanted to be with you. Miss Filanthi? Please come in. Sir... have mercy on the poor, the orphans... the widows... the sick and bitter. In prisons, have mercy on those who hate me... and they wronged me... and do not let them perish because of me, the sinner. Your Honor. The Archbishop sends his greetings... and regrets having to cancel your meeting. He is overwhelmed with so many contingencies. If he doesn't want to see me, that's fine. Just tell me the truth. I prefer to hear the truth. Shall I sit next to you? It's hard to be hungry and poor... and not being able to do anything. But there is something in all this despair. When the Lord becomes your only hope... then you feel His presence. I have been blessed recently... to share in your sufferings, my brother. You are different from them. They don't seem to care about me. They don't seem to care about me either. But the good news is that God loves us. Never forget that. Please take these. I have another pair at home. What did I do; I must have done something. Why didn't he want to see me? What did they tell him? He must think I betrayed him. I can't even bear to think about it. Please sir... give me a chance to talk to him. How are you doing, my brother? I do sacramental graces for people like you, but they are not enough. I do not understand why the Synod does not give me a bishopric in Greece. Because you are slandered from Egypt. They keep sending letters. Most are anonymous. I'm gone. Why won't they leave me alone? If they give you a bishopric here, in Athens... you will be able to replace the Patriarch. But I don't want to replace him. They don't know that. And they certainly don't want to be exposed. So they will never stop persecuting me? I will leave and go to a monastery. You can not do that. You have a gift, my brother. People are listening to you. In these difficult times... Greece needs you. What do you say I do then? I can't even find a position as a preacher. There are bishops and priests who know you are innocent. And we will continue to fight for you at the Synod. Meanwhile... go see the minister of education and religious affairs. He has the power to appoint you a preacher. Excuse me, Your Honor. It's one of those days when everything goes wrong. How can I help you; I am Nektarios, Metropolitan of Pentapolis. I have been in Athens for a year without the means to make a living. I kindly request you to appoint me as a preacher... wherever you wish. I am willing to work for food and shelter. These are my documents. And this is a letter of recommendation from the Holy Synod. You have all the qualifications to be a preacher, Your Reverence. But there is a problem. You are not a Greek citizen. Sorry; You were born in Silivria... which no longer belongs to Greece. It belongs to Turkey now. So now... I am not Greek; And what am I, then? Can you tell me what I am since I'm not Greek? Forgive me for coming and wasting your time. You seem to be genuine. That's why they don't like you. Who are they; You know who they are. Otherwise, with all your qualifications... you wouldn't ask me to find you a place in the church. There is a place that no one wants. It is located on the island of Evia. Would you like to get a position there? Of course I would. You are being hired. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart. I promise... that you won't regret it. - Good morning. - Good morning. My dear brothers in Christ... blessed... they are those with a clear conscience. Pharisee! How deluded they are... those who seek to find happiness beyond themselves? Away from themselves. Did you come to steal our money too? Shame on you! In riches... to pleasures, to glory. Shame on you! And in all vanities... which... they end up in bitterness. Please... Please help me Lord. What do you want me to do; To leave; I do not know what to do. Please give me the strength... to do the right thing. What is Your will? The genuineness of your faith... it is more precious than gold... that was not touched by the fire. The glory, honor and revelation of Jesus Christ... that without having seen Him, you love Him... believe in Him. Your Honor. They are persecuting you in Athens. God bless them. Thank God for your success... in the land of Egypt. And for your willingness... to support our Church. In times like these... our Church desperately needs people like you. We know you support the Greek Patriarchate of Alexandria. And we are grateful... that you responded to our need and came to visit us. May God reward you. We are really glad, gentlemen, to have you here. - Let's get started... - Excuse me for interrupting. But before we start the discussion... we would like to know the whereabouts of Metropolitan Nektarios. He was not convicted... and expelled by Patriarch Sophronius? Shame... to those who... they condemned him. Including Patriarch Sophronios. Where is it; I don't think it's in Athens. Where is it; I believe he received the post of preacher in Euboea. Preacher? -What happens; -Excuse me... but we were informed about him... by representatives of your Patriarchate. We want... Metropolitan Nektarios to return... as our next Patriarch. Before we talk about business... We would like you to make it clear to everyone... that Metropolitan Nektarios is holy and just. And that he was slandered. We will do it. Let's send an urgent telegram... in the Diocese of Evia. Right now! MOUNT HOLY He has no monastery for you. Not yet. We succeeded, despite the obstacles from Alexandria. They still can't forget me. Forget them. You are the best man... to guide our young people into the priesthood. Dear Father Sophronie... I was officially appointed director... at the prominent Rizario Ecclesiastical School. Deep in my heart... I believe this news will please you... as you have always believed in me. Since I didn't get a chance to see you... please allow me to request in writing... your forgiveness... for whatever offense I may have committed. I am asking you to forgive me... whatever that was. I pray you are well... and may God bless you with many years. And I hope to see you again. Let me ask you, gentlemen... where students hold church services. In the church, not far from here. Unfortunately, they cannot be performed here due to the state of the chapel. Something has to be done about it. Obviously, Your Honor, but the resources are not there. We have to find a way. It is a church school. Allow me to correct you, Your Honor. It is not just a church school. It's a regular high school, too. And our main goal is to provide students with... an excellent education. I understand. But if we take care of the chapel... and make the school look more attractive... we will attract more students... who will receive an excellent education. Of course, but I don't see how we're going to achieve that. As I said, resources are limited. As the new manager... I will do my best... to help with this. I will gladly provide my salary... and some of my skills... and I'm sure God will provide the rest. I speak from experience when I say that God will provide them. Well... that sounds... wonderful. Excuse me, Your Honor. Let me show you to your office. Kostas from here. He will help you with anything you need. I am very glad, Kostas. The pleasure is all mine, Your Honor. Let me take the things to your room. I thank you. Please, make yourself comfortable. We'll see you soon. Thank you very much. How long have you been here, Kostas? I graduated last year. Thinking of becoming a priest? Probably not. Well, I'll let you settle, Your Honor. Whenever you need me, I'll be here. I thank you. He looks different from the previous manager. Remember when he used to make us pull weeds as punishment? We probably won't have to do that again. Maybe we'll get lucky and have some fun now and then. -Truth; -I came here to become a priest. I forgot it. In the jungle where you came from, no fun is allowed. What did you say; -What did you say; -Forget it. Does not matter. Your Honor. This is for you, Your Honor. Many letters from Egypt. You asked me to keep my wits about me. I understand why the people of Egypt love you. You have been here for a short time... and you performed miracles. I have read some of your writings. Yes and... I was very moved. Which ones did you like? I liked them... I liked them... everything i read. I believe your writing will help people. I am glad to hear this. I would like them to be printed and published. Let me help you. I know a very good printing house... and I could submit them to religious journals. Writings like these are needed. I would greatly appreciate it. What happened; - He insulted me. - No, he insulted me. He called me a Turk. - Did you say that? - No. Yes, you said it. You keep cursing us. - You stole the book. - Which book? The one in your bag. He gave it to me to read. I didn't steal anything! Liar! I think I've heard enough. I do not have an other choice... from punishing myself. - Yourself, Your Honor? - Yes, myself. I will punish myself with a hunger strike. Please... to inform the cook not to send food for three days. Was I understood? Yes, Your Honor. Go. And, please, reconcile with each other. Otherwise I will continue my punishment for a longer time. Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on the sinner. Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on the sinner. Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on the sinner. Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on the sinner. Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on the sinner. Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on the sinner. I learned that you are looking for me. Why are students being punished without me knowing? Because we don't think you exercise enough power. I administer punishments when I feel it is necessary. A healthy balance between kindness and authority is preferable. Punishing yourself instead of the students... it's unbalanced, in my opinion. Probably your main goal... is to direct them to the priesthood. Not all of them are destined to become priests. We have just come out of the Middle Ages. Four hundred years of Ottoman oppression and slavery. Education is vital to our development. For the development of the clergy and laity. - I hope you understand. - Of course. Cultivate asceticism in our students. And asceticism is a thing of the past. It is a product of the Middle Ages. I think you have a distorted view of asceticism. No, I have a perfect picture of asceticism. It is a radical approach to religion. Long beards and cloaks... and cultivating a holy image, outwardly, of course. A true ascetic... he is not at all concerned about his external image. His main concern... is to correct himself internally... to draw near to God. He is, essentially, a real Christian. Are you a real Christian? I try to be. Your appointment to this school... was not accompanied by the appropriate documents... and the ministry is called... that you were driven out of Egypt for moral reasons. I was slandered. Of course. Did you ask them to look into my background? No, Your Honor. We only asked for information, in an official capacity. So, the counselors of the Patriarchate... they blindly informed the representative of the Greek government... that I was fired from my position because I was... "Reactive, uncouth and unethical?" Mr. Gryparis closes the letter clearly stating... how he thinks you are a perfect cleric... who was unjustly slandered. But the slanderers keep following me, don't they? Where are my accusers? Where are the witnesses? Where is the evidence of my crime? On what basis... four years after my unjust departure from Egypt... was this formal complaint made against me? A complaint that condemns me to a moral death. What is the great wrong I have done against you, Your Blessedness? Why is there so much wrath and persecution against me... intended to destroy me completely? The purpose of my belated protest... is to inform you... that your anger against me is unjust. May God be my witness and judge. Santa, leave the garden to me. You wiped out the whole school. You have to rest. I love this garden, Your Honor. It makes the school so beautiful. If you keep doing my gardening... I might have to do some of your cleaning. No, don't even say it as a joke, Your Honor. Cleaning toilets belittles you. Honest and hard work never underestimates anyone. Let's go have a coffee. Do you want to have coffee with me? Yes, Santa. I want to have coffee with you. Leave it here. Come on, lets go. I have called this meeting, gentlemen... due to a medical need of our student, Nikolaos. He has had a fever for over two weeks. His condition is critical... and despite the treatments of the doctors it does not improve. Doctors don't know what's wrong with him. His illness... it appears to be psychological in nature. I therefore recommend that he be transferred to the sanatorium. We need to inform his guardian. We can't do that. He needs to go to the hospital to get a proper diagnosis... which is opposite. Not in a sanatorium far from here. Besides, he has a fever. It's here with the lowest fees. I doubt he can pay for extra treatment. We will pay for her. It's the least we can do for such a diligent student. We cannot bear to undertake such a large expense, Your Honor. He is here on a partial scholarship. I believe we have already done more than we can. Let's notify his guardian immediately. I'll pay for her myself. We did all the tests. We don't know what's going on. His health is failing. I'm sorry to say... but we expect the worst until tomorrow. What's the matter, my child? You are holding something very heavy inside. No matter what, know that God loves you... and he wants you to do great things. God has forgotten me. Why do you say this; I studied hard... so that i can come here... and... to help my father... and my sisters. But it was all in vain. My father... committed suicide... and my stepmother sent my sisters as slaves. As you can see... God wants me to die. We will see that. Dear Kostas, inform our students... that we will pray all night for the healing of Nicholas. Father! Nikolaos woke up! He asked for food. God has heard your prayers, Your Honor. God heard the prayers of all of us. Look how beautiful they are. "Justice and truth compel... to approve the Metropolitan of Pentapolis and to confirm... that his candidacy is one of the strongest... because he is one of the most distinguished... educated and approachable bishops... which the Orthodox Church has". - Kostas, I read it. - I know. I just want to emphasize what the most respected newspaper says about you. "His character is such... that if someone else is chosen for the Patriarchal throne... he will be pleased." I would like to remain "pleased". Father, don't say such things. They make you languish. I hope you are not shirking your divine duty. I avoid nothing, especially divine things. I just prefer the simple world. Looks like your time has come. Don't forget those who did not support the slanderers. We pray that you will be elected. Justice will prevail this time. The silence cut you like a knife. A word from you would ease my pain. Even a lie or a slur... but nothing. As if I didn't matter to you. Did you really believe I was a fraud? That I wanted your place? Or fear don't lose your place... blinded you to such an extent? You called me your son, remember? I loved you like my father. But some other things were more important to you... from your son. My dear Father Sophronie... justice will prevail today. I will not be elected Patriarch. Thank you. Father. How can you be happy? You were meant to be a Patriarch and you know it. Everyone knows it. God's will be done, Kostas. You are destined for great things. You don't have to be a Patriarch to do great things. Your Honor, I need to speak to you. Your articles and books... they are full of wisdom and truth. And the most important... people listen to what you say. You know... we have a big problem with heretics in our city. Could you write something to encourage people… to stay in the orthodox tradition? It would be my pleasure, Your Honor. I need your help with this. Please, will you make an effort... clean up your record? Sorry; You need to clear your record in Egypt. They have to give you a bishopric. I did what I could... to resolve my situation in Egypt. Maybe you could help me. First, you need to resolve the issue with the Patriarchate of Egypt. You are considered a traveling bishop because of your profession. That is, you are not a Greek citizen. And I still don't consider myself Greek. You are a holy man, Your Highness. Forgive me for bothering you. You do not bother me. I am very happy to be here. There is much light around you. Not that anyone else would notice, Your Honor. I lost my sight from an illness from a very young age. My parents had to choose. Let me get a shot and go blind... or let me die. Thank God, they chose me to live. Life is so beautiful, Your Honor. I was so lucky. And when I met you... and I received your blessing. What's your name; Xenia. Xenia, thank you very much for your kind words. I thank you, Your Honor. Forgive me if I'm being bold... but can i talk to you again? Some of my friends and I would like to become nuns. Could you guide us? It would be my pleasure to help you. Please come and see me in my office. Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on the sinner. Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on the sinner. Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on the sinner. Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on the sinner. Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on the sinner. Well... please tell me When did the idea of ​​becoming a nun come about? We've been talking about it for a long time... and we all decided... that we really want to do it. Your wish is nice... but you know that if you become a nun... do you accept poverty and a very difficult life? We know that. Our life was not easy. We all grew up as orphans, in extreme poverty. Hardships do not scare us, as long as we stay together. Only a few are chosen to follow this path. You have to be really ready and willing... cross it to the end. We are, Your Honor. Is there a place you would like to go? Have you visited monasteries? We visited quite a few... but it is difficult to find a place that accepts us all. And we want to stay together. So, the best choice... would be to find a place... where we can establish a monastery. Thank you, Your Honor. We'll start looking right away. Whose land is this? Of the Municipality, Your Honor. I have some girls who are my spiritual daughters... and they want to become nuns. They found an old monastery that is in ruins in Aegina. Since Aegina is under your jurisdiction... I would like to receive your blessing for these... to establish a monastery there. That's wonderful. You have all my blessings. - Thank you, Your Honor. - Thank God for that. We must awaken monasticism. We need new nuns. Most monasteries are essentially cemeteries. Yes, I have some new nuns from Spata... who would like to join the monastery. If you do this... I promise that the monastery will be recognized by the Holy Synod. Thank you, Your Honor. You know, I really need your help. Any news from Egypt? I tried to contact His Beatitude Patriarch Photios. I am well aware that he received my letters. But as usual, there was no response. I also contacted the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople... Joachim III. Great, it can definitely help. Honestly, I don't understand why the Synod here in Athens... cannot grant a bishopric to an itinerant prelate... who has been training the future priests for so many years. As I told you before... It's complicated. We have sugar, cumin and thread. As well as silk, and lots of manuscripts, of course. Perfect. Let's send money to the mayor Mr. Peppa. He will see to it that they receive them. Is he not well, Kostas? Father... I will gladly do whatever you want. But I don't see how that's possible... to rebuild the monastery with your salary... and some donations. With God, all things are possible. I got more mulberry trees and fruit trees. They will plant them all over Aegina. How many trees have we shipped so far? Six to seven thousand, I think. Seven thousand? Don't worry, Kostas. They give me almost nothing. I would like to send some copies of my new book. Did we manage to print anything? Unfortunately, no. We owe money to the printer again. Does not matter. It will have to wait until I get paid. Of course. Why are toilets so dirty? - The curator is in the hospital. - And why didn't we hire someone else? - How hard can it be? - I already found a replacement. Truth; May I know who he is? Someone I trust. Who are these women who have permission to enter... and why do they come here? They are my spiritual children. Your spirit children? They want to become nuns and seek my advice. It's not enough that you want to convince them all to become priests... now you prepare nuns from here too? I want them to return the entry permits and not come here again! I'm sorry, Your Honor. I didn't want to do that. No, I'm sorry. I made you angry. Your Honor? Santa Claus? Don't worry, I won't take your job. You saved me and my family. Please. Please. Let it stay between us. Come on, rest. And I will be waiting for you. I want to tell you something. I've been tired lately. I have less and less energy to do what I want. You know I want to retire to the monastery. I feel it is my duty... to go to Aegina and take responsibility... for the monastery and the nuns. I don't believe what I'm hearing. You are a respected priest and writer. You can't give it all up... and go to a deserted island. My inner voice, my heart... informs me that I must go to Aegina. If they call you back, to Egypt? Please. Stop thinking about that. I will never stop thinking about it. You deserve it... to become a Patriarch. There is a danger... to what you want me to be, Kostas. When you become a Patriarch... you become a man of power. The position of power is like a cancer. It's slowly eating you up... and you don't even know it. Before you know it... you may transform into something you once loathed. Many greats have fallen... because of the power given to them. I'd rather not fall into that trap. I'm begging you, don't go. I have made up my mind. You will leave me all alone. You are not alone, Kostas. You are... more father to me... than my real father ever was. Please, I'm not leaving you. Good things will happen to you. Go ahead, have faith. - Should I pass, Your Honor? - Of course. I came to say goodbye and... let me tell you... even if you don't believe it... that thank you I thank you, Mr. President. You really mean it, don't you? Of course I mean it. I'm starting to think... that you are not human. I assure you that I am human, Mr. President. No, I assure you that I am human. I'm the one who dislikes you. Maybe I envy you, in a weird way. Although I loathe your ways... your asceticism and all that goes with it... Honestly, I can't stand him. But I see you found peace in him. So, I have to say this is good. Are you at peace, Mr. President? No. NO I have not. But I don't care about that. I only care about the truth. Without peace in your heart... you will never be able to know the truth. So, I need your God… to find peace He does not allow me to find peace. He has been torturing me all my life. I wish I had faith... and to believe... but I can not... to deny logic. You stand for something, Mr. President. You are a good person. I'm sure you'll find your way. How much; Nothing, just keep blessing our nets, Father. Did you leave class again, Chrysafenia? You are not teaching us today and I already know how to read and write. You can always improve or learn something new. I will read here, next to you. "John the Forerunner". Do you know what "precursor" means? That's his last name. It's not that, my dear. Do you know why we also call him a Baptist? It's his middle name. You see; You still have a lot to learn. And I'm sorry, but it's almost time for Vespers. I must get ready. So how is life in the city? Busy. I have many new applications... for your articles and books. We will no longer owe money to anyone. My new job is amazing and now that I can live here... can't complain about anything. You see; Things always find their way. Yes, you are right, Your Honor. It's time for the Synod... to officially accept the monastery. I wrote to Metropolitan Theoklitos, but he did not answer me. Maybe you can visit him for me. Father... it is rumored that Metropolitan Theoklitos... intends to close your monastery. It can not be done. He gave me his blessing to establish it. I know. Don't believe such rumours. You are smarter. Father, I'm afraid it's not just a rumor. It seems that he was displeased that you left Athens and came here. He wanted you there to help him. And you know you can still be a Patriarch. They didn't give me a bishopric here, do you want me to be elected Patriarch? The people of Egypt want you to be their Patriarch. You must have figured it out by now... that it doesn't matter what the people want. My soul is deeply saddened... which I was informed by the Most Reverend... that without my own knowledge and will... a community of women was created in Aegina. Because without my knowledge and consent from me... the ecclesiastical hierarch, you created the monastery... and for what reason? So now you know nothing about it, my brother? Absolutely nothing; Has the decision arrived from the Metropolitan? Yes, it has arrived. Does he want to give absolution to the monastery? No. He wants a written record and a detailed report. I will prepare my own... and i want your help... to prepare the report naming each sister... the details of their ranking... and their financial contributions. There is nothing else we can do. Your Honor... you suffer so much... and all your sufferings are due to us. I think you should leave. You have done enough. We will find a way. I will never betray you. You wouldn't betray us if you left. Yes, I would betray you. And this will cause a pain so shocking... that can break your soul. Believe me... I know this pain. The property is private. If the monastery is not recognized by the Synod... neither will the state accept it. All donations... and I see there are many... they will not be considered part of the monastery. Nor the private property donated by the nuns. If you make it church property... belonging to the Synod... they will probably accept it. However, this leaves the nuns at the mercy of the Synod. No. It must remain independent. To belong privately to the nuns. Then, the Synod must recognize it as such. Are you telling me that we are completely at the mercy of the Synod? There is another way, Your Honor. I just don't know if you would want to go down that path. Who is; If the Synod does not recognize the monastery... you can make it a nonprofit. In this case the state will approve it... and will function as an independent monastery. Like those in the West. Then, that's what we'll do, if necessary. You do not see... that all these obstacles... are these signs to get out of here? Go somewhere more suitable for you? What is more appropriate? Some high office in the church? I don't understand you, Father. When you were exiled from Egypt... when you got run over... when everyone wanted you to stand up for yourself... keep quiet... and you turned the other cheek too. But now... when they ransack the monastery and these women... you are not only willing to talk and fight… but also to oppose the Synod. My dear Kostas... when they chase you... the right thing is to turn the other cheek... but when your children run after you because someone wants to hurt you... the right thing is to fight. To protect your children. I'm sorry, Father. I can't accept it. And I will never accept that you... the greatest hierarch of our church... you are stuck here... in these hills... and you languish. My body may be languishing... but not my soul either. I wish she would just leave me alone and disappear. I understand. Do not worry. We will pray for your mother. So, my precocious one, have you come to your senses? Mother, I am happy here. You are not happy. Everyone knows that only broken people end up in monasteries. And they die in misery. I don't feel that way at all. Go back to your husband, Maria. I don't have a husband. You forced me to be engaged to him. I'm not going back to him. Do you think I liked being with your father? I took care of you even when you left us with nothing! You think it was easy? And you want me to fornicate? - I don't want to talk about it anymore. - What did they do to you; -What did they do to you; - My good wife. I can help you; I want my daughter back! Tell her to go home with her mother. Mary... do you want to go home with your mother? No, Your Honor, I don't want to. I want to stay here, please. As you heard, he wishes to stay. Tell her to go home with her mother. I can not. And I won't. I'll make you pay for it, pimp. The whole island knows about you, fallen bishop. They dethroned you and banished you. Did you think you'd come here and pretend to be a saint? You pissed off the wrong woman! I'll see you in hell! My dear sir, I need to speak to you urgently. I'm sorry, ma'am, but you have to make an appointment. Metropolitan Meletios told me to come. Did the Venerable Meletius send you? They took my child. They took her away from me and destroyed her. Who took her? The deposed bishop, Nektarios. He manipulated and seduced her. I tried to get her back, but she won't let me see her. I think he got her pregnant, like the others. I do not know what to do. He turned it on me. And he took her away. Come with me. I promise I'll take care of it personally. You disgraced the title of bishop. Read these categories. Its a shame! What do you do with these women? What have you got? I had to come here with an investigator. You created a scandal for the Church. Please forgive me. It looks like you're innocent, for now. I will send you instructions with what I want you to do. And I will check on you... on a regular basis. And please try to dress more appropriately. You look more like a beggar than a Bishop. I was praying. What were you praying for? Can you tell me what you were praying for? I was praying to God... to punish the awful man who came here. You should never pray for God to punish someone. But why; He was awful to you. God wants us to forgive those who mistreat us. We must pray even for our enemies. Sorry, but I don't understand. You don't have to understand everything. But trust me on this one. Are you the famous Bishop Nektarios? I am Bishop Nektarios. How can I help you; Don't play the saint on me, you impostor. You fooled your Metropolitan, but you don't fool me. I know what you are doing here with your supposed nuns. How many fetuses have you condemned in this space, murderer? Why don't you answer, you hypocrite? Stop! He is sick! You are all crazy! You defend this Satan! Why are you doing this; Get out of his bed now! He can't move! Leave her alone. There is nothing here. Take her! Father, why don't you say something? You will not escape justice. You will go to jail. I will send a doctor to examine all the nuns. Starting with Maria Frangioudaki! No! She is a virgin. Old man! These stories for you! Are they real? Come! They must be real. Can you tell me. You can confess to me. I will understand. No one can be normal... in this pitiful world. You must be crazy... to survive. I know it well! I am the thief on the cross. I know how bad we all are. AEGINA, 1920 I have to sit down. You have been in pain for a long time, Father. We better call the doctor. Please... please bring me a glass of lemonade. Why did they make this window? For the food. It's easier that way. For whom; Wouldn't it be better for them to come and help you? Don't worry, Kostas. Father Savvas is here. He takes very good care of me. I have to confess something to you. If they had done to me what they did to you... I wouldn't go to church anymore. I am stunned by your faith. Alas for me... if my faith depends on people. The doctor came. You must have prostate surgery immediately. I will arrange for you to be admitted to the hospital immediately. We'll see. Are you sure you want to do this? We will take you to the hospital shortly. Keep your strength. I want to talk to my Mother. Please, Mother. Please help me, Mother. I can not stand... so much pain Please. Please, Mother. Soon... will not... can i do more... to help my children. Please. Please, Mother. Please protect them. Please, Mother. Request... Mother, ask your Only Begotten Son... keep them out of harm's way, please. Please. Please protect... all the people of this island. Please, Mother. Please. Are you okay, Father? Who is this; An unhappy family man. He fell off a cliff and was paralyzed. You think... that he will be able to survive... from surgery? You must be a man of God... since so many nuns are taking care of you. God only knows how much. I do not understand. I don't understand why God... he didn't let me die when I fell off the cliff. I can't... I don't understand why. He's got... He has a purpose for you, my brother. "Some purpose"? What purpose? I can not do anything. I can't move my body. I can only sit here... like a piece of meat. I can't take care of my family. I can't feed my children. I can not do anything. I don't know why I'm here. All of us... we have to set... this question. You're... just forced to do it. Holy man of God... holy man of God... could you please... can you please pray for me Maybe... maybe God... have a surprise for you. Oh my God... Are you speaking to me, my Lord?
