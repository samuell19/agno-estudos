(loud howling) (dreamy music) (loud shrill) (dramatic music) (leaves rustling) (sign creaking) (footsteps thud) (camera shutter clicks) (camera shutter clicks) (camera shutter clicks) (camera shutter clicks) - Thank you. (wind howls) (moves into mysterious music) You see something, Scott? - It's nothin'. - Okay. All right. - Let's do this, before we get caught! (camera shutter clicks) - Tell me there's something else in here besides just in here besides just this banner. - There is. - Nice, that's what I'm talking about. - The truth. - Wow, I can't imagine anything more boring than the truth on a banner. - We're getting the message out, Jason, and that's what matters. - What matters is we get this done before the wind picks up and our message gets blown into the Pacific. - Yeah, let's fly this baby and get out of here so we can do some celebration drinkin'. - Not really all that committed to the cause, are you, Jason? - I'd commit to you, for at least two weeks, if you gave me a shot, darlin'. - Seriously, you're like my dad's age. - Maybe we should stop the flirting and concentrate on this. - Are you or are you not dating Dr. Hottie? - Dr. Hottie? - Dr. Hottie. (laughs) Dr. Hottie's and my relationship has nothing to do with-- - Ah, busted! Agh! Damn wind, it's getting crap in my eyes. - You picked a really good spot. People are gonna see our message for miles. Maybe even get some real media attention. - Oh, don't act so surprised. You know I do whatever I can for the cause, Barbie. - Okay, maybe I got you a little wrong. - I'm sorry. - About what? - It's just, if you hadn't met me, then you'd still have your job. - Do you really want to bring that up now? - But they never would have come after you that hard if it hadn't been for your job. - You had nothing to do with it, Carla. (dramatic music) - You used to love charging into burning buildings and saving lives. And well, now you're hanging a banner. - I live to hang up banners. All right, let's go! Let's do this! (energetic music) - Yup. - That's my favorite man. (loud beeps) (moves into dramatic music) - Guys! Guys, we have a situation here. It's a bomb. - Uh, that's bad, right? - Run! Everybody run! (loud beep) Run! (loud beep) (loud beep) Down there! Down in the gully! Get down! (loud beeps) (thunderous explosion) (screams) (fire sizzles) (wind howls) - What the hell's happening? (loud rumbling) - Move it! Move it! Move it! - Jason! Jason! - Hi! Come on! - Get up! Get, move! (dramatic music) - Is it gone? - Oh, please be gone. (loud howling) - Oh, my god! - Run! Run fast! There! Right there! (heavy breathing) Storm drain! - Go, go! - Go, go, go! - Go, go! - Down! (loud sizzling) Hang on! Stay strong! - Oh, my god! - [Jason] Go around! Just go by! Just go by! (Jason screams) - [Carla] Oh, make it stop! (heavy breathing) - You okay? (alarm rings continuously) You okay? - Uh, Jason, you can let go now. Jason? - Huh? Oh, yeah. (breathes heavily) - Hey, what the hell was that? - A fire twister. - Say wh, what? - A tornado made of fire. - I've seen one once before, they're usually a natural phenomenon. - Don't normal tornadoes just usually get bored and then disappear into the sky or something? - This one seemed to keep on burning. - I know. (sirens wailing) - That thing could hurt a lot of people. - [Carla] Are you okay? - Yeah, just a little shaken up. - Come on, guys. Let's get out there and hope to God that thing is gone. - Guys, why are you going out there? It's not so bad in here. - [Carla] Get out here, Jason! - Is it gone? - It should be by now. - Should be. (loud sizzling and howling) (ominous music) - Oh, god. - I gotta warn 'em! - Oh, my god! - [Carla] We'll be right behind you. (loud gunshots) - Down! Get down! (Barbie screams) Get down! - [Jason] What's happening? (energetic music) - Let's stay down! - [Jane] We have to get closer! Move! - Look! We're sitting ducks here. We're gonna go, go! - Go, go! - Go, go! Let's go, run! (loud gunshots) Over there! Come on, get up there! (bullets clink against metal) Everyone okay? - We're good. - We gotta go. We can't stay here! This way, come on! This way! Okay, down here. - Who is it? (breathes heavily) - Ssh. - [Jane] So we lost 'em. This isn't really acceptable, is it? - [Logan] Okay, what's our next move? - [Jane] All right, fan out. You take the field, I'll take the road. - Who are they? - If they're tryin' to kill us for hanging a banner, I think they're kind of over-reacting. - No, they've gotta be connected with the explosion. - Okay, you know what? - I think I'm being pretty freakin' cool considering I'm being chased by the wrath of God. And now we've got sexy assassins gunning us down? What the hell, man? This was not part of the orientation package. - Okay, you're right, this isn't normal, but here's a news flash, Jason, these people do not play fair and they're gonna do some pretty horrible things to try and make us go away. - Well, maybe we should take the hint and go away! - (sighs) We're stuck in this, Jason, together, okay? - Yeah, look, we cannot just stick our heads into the sand. - Yeah, we can, ostriches do it. - Oh, my god. - Don't give me that look. Okay, eagles might soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines. - Okay, you know what, Jason? If I have to kick your ass, it ain't gonna be pretty. - I disagree. I think kicking Jason's ass would be a work of art. - Maybe. All right, Scott, what's the plan here? (dramatic music) - We're not safe here, we gotta keep moving. - Get him! - Hey! (muffled speech) Hey, what the Hell? - Ssh. Who are you? (muffled speech) Are you with them? - We're stellar acting, bro. Look, he's faking it. He makes one call to his buddies and we're toast. (muffled speech) - Okay, I'm not faking it, okay? I work here, I have a business card in my pocket, okay? I'll get it. - Hey! - Relax, it's just a card. See? (Carla sighs) - Why are you trying to kill us? And who are those people? - Look, I'm not trying to kill anybody, and I don't know who those people are, okay? I came down here because I heard an explosion and lots of gunfire. Who are you? - Those two are gonna be back soon. Do you know a way out of here? - Yeah, there's an old utility road just over there that leads down to the lower parking lot. - He's our best shot. - Okay, let's go. - Oy, Jesus! - Watch him. - Yeah. (loud beeping) (cell phone rings) - [Man] Is it done? - The tank blew, but whatever the hell was in it went up like Hiroshima, turned into a pillar of fire, and now it's rampaging toward the city. What was in the tank? - [Man] That's need-to-know only, I would think the CIA hammered that into you. It doesn't matter, this is perfect, the more destruction the better. - One minor snag, the tree-huggers saw us and can make an ID. - That's a serious problem, V. Can you take care of them? - Don't tell me how to do my job. (loud gunshots) Call Huey and Louie. (energetic fast music) - [Scott] That wasn't oil in that tank, was it? - No, far from it. - What exactly do you do? - I'm chief engineer at Synco. We're developing a new, revolutionary type of fuel. It was gonna change the world, but. I mean, just who the hell are you guys, anyway? And why would you destroy something that I spent five years of my life tryin' to create? - We didn't blow up the tank. - There was a bomb, a very sophisticated bomb, when we got there. - So what were you doing there? Looking for a place to picnic? - We were told that it was a traditional storage tank for oil. - That's what I heard. - We were gonna hang an anti-oil banner on it, that's it! We were peacefully protesting. - You're protesting us? We're on the verge of putting big oil out of business. - What? - My fuel is the first smart fuel. It's called MT-11 and it's a hydrogen-based synthetic that, that burns 10 times longer than traditional fuel and its only emission is water. It's designed to respond to the minute-to-minute needs of an engine and adjust its combustive capacity to maximize efficiency. - That's good, right? - It's a game changer. That's when it's applied to an engine. I mean, if that thing is made up of MT-11, it's gonna burn for a very long time. - How long? - Caught up in a twister like that, it could burn indefinitely. And it will get bigger. - So, what are we gonna do? - We're gonna hunt that thing down and kill it. Can you help us? - Help you? I'm the only one that can stop it. - Look where it's going! (dramatic drum music) - Hang on! - We're gonna do some back flips and some cartwheels? - Handstands? (mother laughs) - Morning. Handstands, I can do a handstand. - Yeah. ♪ You don't have to let this world take control ♪ ♪ Leave your head now ♪ Baby, I'll go ♪ You don't have to go full life on your own ♪ ♪ No, I know you got soul (leaves rustle) (fire sizzles) (thundering crackles) (man screams) (dramatic fast music) (gun cocked loudly) - Looks like the Nylander guy is a real American hero. Trail's gone cold. How are we gonna find him? - Just look for the big, orange thing in the sky. They'll be there. - Where did it go? - Yeah, where did it go? - So, can I ask like a dumb question? Why can't we just call one of your old fire-guy buddies and let them take care of it? - We can't just hope people will solve the problem for us, Jason. - You know, if you get me close to it, I think I can figure out a way to extinguish it. (loud sizzling) (Barbie screams) - Hold on! - [Barbie] Oh, my god! - Go, reverse, reverse! - [Anthony] Go, come on! Let's go, let's go, let's go! - Scott! Go, go, go! Oh, my god! Go! Floor it! Floor it! - Hurry! - Oh my god! - Faster! - You need to go faster, you need to go fast! - [Carla] It's a dead end! - When I stop, everybody get out and run! - Yes. Okay. (tires screech loudly) - Run! Get down! (car explodes) (screams) (loud sizzling) (Barbie gasps) (loud crash) (metallic howling) (roaring explosion) So, that was fun! (alarms beep continuously) - Everyone okay? - [Anthony] Yeah. (dog barks) (sad piano music) - Oh, my god. - Honey, are you okay? - She's gone. (sobs) - Who? - She got pulled into the sky. - Who's gone? - My mommy, can you find her? (sirens wailing) We were taking Sarah for a walk. And then the devil monster took them into the sky. - Baby, are you hurt anywhere? - [Anna] Help, help me, someone, please! Where's my baby? My baby, help me, please, someone! Up here, please, help me! - Mommy! - Baby, are you okay? - I'm gonna go up and get your mom, okay? You stay here? I'm comin' up. - Okay. Please, hurry. - [Scott] Hold on. Hold on. - I'm trying! - [Scott] You're gonna be fine, just hold on. - [Anna] Okay. (Anna screams) - [Scott] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - [Anna] Hi. - Hey, I'm Scott, what's your name? - Anna. - Okay, Anna, I'm gonna get you down from here. - [Anna] Okay. - But I'm gonna need your help. - Okay. - Can you move? - I, I think so. But, my baby, is my baby okay? - Okay, I'm gonna get her. Now hold on! - But, ow, but. - Don't worry! (Anna screams) I'm gonna get it! Hold on. - [Anna] Ow! - [Scott] I got-- (Anna screams) - [Jason] Oh, god! - Sarah. (Anna panting) - That's my baby's doll. - Sarah! - But thank you for saving her. (loud laughing) - Oh, you're such a hero, Scott! - Nice goin', Fireman! Good job. - All right. (sirens wailing) - [Shane] Twister came right through here. They gotta be nearby. (gun cocked) (ominous music) - Okay. Showtime. (guns cocked) - No, really, take it. (helicopter blades whir) Just make sure you stop it before it hurts anyone else. Thank you, for everything. - Well, thank you. - We'll get it back to you in good shape. - Go inside and be safe. - Come on, honey. - Bye. - All right, let's go find some-- (loud gunfire) - Whoa, whoa! - [Carla] Get in, get in! (loud gunfire) - Down! (tires screech) (screams) Hold on! Get down! Hang on! (gun clicks) (engine rumbles) (car skids loudly) - Drive! - Okay, we're clear! - Who are those Rambos? - Yeah, seriously, and what do they want with us? - Maybe they're the ones who planted the bomb and we were messing up their work. - Maybe they're tryin' to pin it on us. - Is anyone gonna take a shot on how the hell a tornado follows us like Godzilla? - It wasn't trying to find us, it was looking for the heat. - The heat? You mean, like our engine? - Yes, exactly. And like the air conditioning units on the roof tops. I, I think the fuel inside the twister is causing it to search for a hot spot, just like how I designed it to work in an engine. Twister is gonna be drawn to the spikes in the ambient temperature. - It's searching out ways to stay alive. - Yeah, I think so. - Oh, well fantastic. That's great. - We gotta find it, Scott. - I gotta make a phone call. (fire sizzles) (scary music) (sirens wailing) (helicopter blades whir) - Yeah, take Company 17 and 32 and flank it from the east. We're headin' north. We should catch up with it at by-- (cell phone rings) Hey, Scottie, can I call you back? Things are going off the rails here. - Logan, I'm calling about the twister. I've got some info for you. - Okay, you got my attention. - [Woman On Speaker] And be sure to visit us next weekend for our buy one, get one special. So grab a friend, a family member or that special someone. And enjoy all the comfort and safety of your favorite park, together. (dramatic music) (screams) (screams) What is that? - I don't know. I don't know what that is. (screams) (intense sizzling) (terrified screams) (sirens wailing) - Ordinary people have lost everything to this monstrosity. This could happen to any one of us. Oh, excuse me, ma'am, ma'am. - Yes? - Uh, this is your home? (baby cries) - Yes, it is, was. We barely got out alive. - It, it must have been terrifying. What happened? - There was a loud roar. We thought it was an airplane coming down. It sounded like a jet engine or something, and when we looked outside, it was, it was coming down the street. - And I will find out who, if anyone, is responsible for unleashing this unholy terror against our city. (calming music) (birds chirping) (mailbox rumbles) (wind howls) (intense sizzling) (man screams) - Help, agh, agh, agh! Help, agh! (man screams) (loud gurgling) (intense music) (man screams) - Mr. Garber, Mr. Garber, how do you respond to the allegations that the fire twister wreaking havoc across the city was born right here at your plant? - Let me start by saying that we at Synco's hearts go out to the community that has suffered such devastating losses and want to do everything that we can to aid in the recovery process. - Not much is known about what exactly Synco does here, since it's been shrouded in secrecy. Can you shine a light on what it is exactly that you make and how that helped aid this twister? - There's nothing sinister going on here, I can assure you. - You'll know the full Synco story when we release our product line next year. (serious music) - With all due respect, sir, there's a 25-story fire tornado destroying Los Angeles. Corporate secrecy just isn't gonna cut it. - I came from traditional oil, and I believed deeply in that mission, but when the people of Synco showed me what they had cooking here and invited me to run their company, I jumped at the chance to be part of the future. What we have is a game-changer, and it'll be great for America's energy independence, so what's at stake here is no less than our national security. But rest assured, we will cooperate with the authorities in every way possible. - You still haven't delivered any information-- - These people illegally broke into our facility this morning and we believe were responsible for blowing one of our storage tanks. This is Scott Nylander, he's a former LA firefighter who suffered a mental breakdown on the job and developed paranoid fantasies that the oil industry was out to get him. After being placed on indefinite medical leave, his emotional issues drove him right into the arms of this group, a radicalized eco-terrorist organization formed by Dr. Carla Lemelin. She's a fringe climate scientist. They thought they could use his former status as a respected Los Angeles firefighter to gain legitimacy for their terrorist activities. But the true nature of their evil became frighteningly clear today. Scott and Carla and their followers are responsible for the explosion and the catastrophic fire twister now plaguing our city. These people are highly dangerous. If you see them, please don't engage and take cover. We don't want them to take any more lives. (cell phone rings) Ah, excuse me, I have to take this. - But Mr. Garber, you still haven't answered the question about what Synco does here. - Okay, that is all, that is all for today, - [Reporter] Mr. Garber! - [Mitch] Talk to me! (ominous music) - We lost them. - You lost them. Well, now, (chuckles) that's unacceptable, isn't it? Tell me, how hard can it be to dispatch a bunch of tree-hugging pacifists? You find them, you understand? You're supposed to be the best, so why don't you show me you can at least be competent! - I can always show you how competent I am in person. - Look, you just make sure that Scott and his merry band of idiots are gone and in a way that's as far removed from us as possible, you understand? This cannot get back to us. - Who is this guy? - I'll send you his info, you can decide for yourself. - [V] Fine, send it. (loud gunshots) - She's got this thing about phones. - [Reporter Voiceover] He knows where it came from. Multiple engine companies from across the state have been deployed to combat the twister. But the devastation caused in its wake seems just too much for these firefighters. So far reports. - Hi, they're not telling you everything. - We'll be there. - Okay, just you, anybody else, I ditch, okay? (sirens wailing) (firetruck horn honks) - What's the situation? How's the containment goin'? - We got a dozen companies surrounding that thing, but we're nowhere near containment. - This is the man that might be able to help. He may know how to stop it. Anthony! - Look, I lost six men on this thing today. Better be some damn good info. What the hell is it? - It's being fueled by a long-burning, experimental, synthetic fuel. - Who the hell are you? - Anthony's the one that created the fuel that it's burning on. - Will it burn itself out on its own? - I don't think so. It's gonna get bigger. - All right, I need you to level with me, partner. What the hell kind of trouble did you get yourself into? (dramatic music) - Trouble? - Your picture is plastered across every TV in the country as the father of this thing. They're calling you and your friends terrorists. - I'm being framed. - Again? People are screaming for your head, dozens are dead and the media is painting you as the mastermind. - I had nothing to do with that, Logan. And we're tryin' to stop it. - People are not in the mood to listen. They are in the mood for blood. The police are looking for you, and they will shoot first and ask questions later. You gotta watch your ass, Scottie. You better go. - [Scott] Let's go, everybody in! (mysterious music) (seat belt clicks) - [Rod] Okay, do you know what MT-11 is? - [Jane] Yeah, of course. - Well, that fuel, they usually keep in a very high security place in a tank in a bunker, underneath the lab. But two days ago, we got an order to transfer all of the fuel to the hilltop silo. Now we don't use that silo for the high-tech stuff, okay? It ain't rated for MT-11. - Well, did they give any reason for the transfer? - No, they said it was because they had too much for the bunker tanks. But that just doesn't make sense. We always just control burn the excess. And the hilltop tanks, got almost no security. - No security? That can't be normal protocol. - Shred everything. - Sir, if the-- - Everything! - Okay. All right, everyone, every piece of paper turns to confetti, every hard drive gets the hammer. Let's chop, chop, chop, it's time to clean house, people. (fire sizzles) (helicopter blades whir) (sirens wailing) (intense music) - We gotta stop this. - Anthony, are you okay? - No. - You guys need to know, we're all over the news as the people who created this. - What? - Us? - Who, who would put that out there? - Same people who are trying to kill us. - Why? - [Scott] That's what I'm trying to figure out. - We just have to tell them that we had nothing to do with it. - They can place us at the scene of the explosion. - And we have a history of trespassing and protesting. - Non-violent protesting. - Okay, you know what? Someone gonna have the courage to sound like a coward and I have that kind of courage. There's professional killers hunting us. We're LAPD's most wanted and, oh yeah, that's right, torch-nado! Okay? This saving the world thing is a little above our pay grade. Why don't we just turn ourselves in, and then we can let the professionals handle this? - Anthony is the professional, he's the only professional who can stop this. I'm in, you can leave any time you want, Jason. (phone rings) Yeah? - [V] Hello, Scott, you know who this is. - How'd you get my number? - You're something of a celebrity, Scott. Celebrities are easy to find. - You gonna tell me why you're trying to kill us? - You seem like a bright enough guy, for someone who runs into burning buildings. I'm calling to offer you a deal. - I'm listening. - You give yourself up to us and your friends get to walk free, everybody wins. - My friend's and I are busting our asses trying to stop this thing from killing more people. - Scott, in the spirit of full disclosure, I kill people for a living. - This twister is killing everything in its path, including garbage. So I'd watch my back. - They give you a reason for why they're trying to kill us? - Not a good one. - There it is! It's slowing down. What's it doing? (dramatic music) - It's having lunch. (loud explosions) - It looks like it's eating the fire. - You know, we can use that, Scott. If it's looking for the heat, maybe we can bait it and then steer it where we want to go. - We could, that, that may work. That's a brilliant idea. (loud creaking) (loud crash) (loud explosion) - Watch out! (debris whizzes) (loud explosion) (wheels screech) (Barbie screams) (intense sizzling) - [Anthony] Go, (mumbles). - [Barbie] Careful! - Look out! - Whoa! (loud explosion) (heavy breathing) - [Barbie] That was horrible! - [Carla] It's okay, it's over now. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - What is it? - What? - [Anthony] Watch out! (dramatic music) - You okay? - Fire came down from the sky. It rained on us. - Okay, uh, you're not safe here. You need to get to safety. You can come with us. (distressed woman moaning) Come with us now! - Oh, no, oh, no! No, no. (chuckles) (gun is cocked loudly) - Why don't you all just stand real still? - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, Look, I'm here to help. - We need your car. - No, we need our car. I was a fireman, we need it to help save these people from the twister. - There ain't no helpin' them, they're already damned. (woman laughs) - [Woman] Love it. - The good Lord sent the pillar of fire promised in Revelations down to smite all ye sinners. - Oh, preach it, Father. Preach it. - We are the chosen ones and the rest of you, well, that's just the way it is. - [Woman] Hallelujah. - But that thing is coming our way! It's gonna fry us! All of us! - God will choose who burns and who doesn't and I think I know who he's gonna choose. - Yeah. - The keys. - God didn't create this, people did! - That thing is gonna burn through here, kill all of us, climb down the mountain and then destroy the city! - And thousands of people will die! - That's the idea. (intense sizzling) - Get down there and take cover right now! - Hold on! Keys, or I'll blow you all to hell myself! - Go on, get down there! - [Anthony] Go, go. - I'll be fine. (tree snaps) (gun fires) (man screams) (woman screams) Into the car! - [Anthony] Go, come on! - Save yourself! - Oh, god, oh, god, help us. (Barbie gasps) (terrified screams) - [Anthony] Oh. - [Scott] Anthony, how do you kill this thing? - Drive it away from all the fuel sources, let it burn itself out. - Yeah, okay, (chuckles) but how do you drive this thing? It mean, it kind of goes where it wants. - [Anthony] It's heading down towards the city. - How do you evacuate millions of people? - You don't. Not in time. (sirens wailing) (helicopter blades whir) (calm music) - Thank you. (intense trembling) (loud clinks) (gasps) (glass cracks) (screams) (sad music) (loud crashes) (intense sizzling) (sirens wailing) ("Ride of the Valkyries" by Richard Wagner) (intense sizzling) (dramatic music) (helicopter blades whir) (sirens wailing) (water splashes) - [V] They're coming your way. (screams) - I think we're getting warm. - Where is it? - Get me close to it, Scott. I think I got another idea. - What's that? (tire screech) Wait, wait, wait! Guys, I know what you Boy Scouts and Brownies are thinking. This seems like a really noble thing for you to do to go and help these wounded guys in the street, but in case you haven't noticed, the world's falling apart right now. - I can't believe you're saying this, Jason. - I can. - This little fender bender here is nothing compared to the firestorm that's ripping through our city. Are we that bad if we just keep going? Okay. - Check that guy. - [Anthony] Yeah. - Hey, you all right? - Yeah, I'm good, how are you doing? (moves into scary music) (tires screech) Turn around. Do it. Walk. - Still the American hero. It's touching, really. Good to finally meet you, Scott. Don't. Inside, now. - No, you're gonna have to do it here. - Let's negotiate inside. - Look, look! You got me, you can let them go now. - That deal expired. - So, no honor. - You people make me sick. We have orders to make this look amateur. Put away your weapons, we're gonna make this a silent kill. Make it messy. Channel your inner marauding looters. - You're a psychotic bitch! - [Scott] Easy. - Stop it! This wasn't part of the deal! (loud slap) Ow! - Ssh. - It wasn't supposed to be like this. - [V] You dance with the devil, you're gonna get burned. - What? - What did you do? - The CEO of Synco paid me to get you guys to put that banner on the tank and it seemed okay, I didn't realize it was a set-up. - Mitch? Our CEO hired you? - A crooked oil man, shocker. - I am so sorry, you guys. - Are we killing people today, or what? - Yes, we are. (Jason screams) - Don't you move! Run! Don't you move! Don't move! You guys, get out of here! Put that fire out for me! Run! You stay! Don't even move! Tell my mom I love her. Don't you move, put your gun down! Put it down, I got you, put it, you put it down right now! Put it-- (Jason chokes) (fists thud against flesh) (dramatic music) (tires screech) - They used Jason. - He didn't deserve that. - Well, things are going even better than we expected. The press is all over Synco now, this company will be bankrupt within a month, then ACI can go on in, buy all their patents and bury them. Where the hell is my completion bonus? (sighs) No, no, no, no, no, no, no I'm not gonna be waiting for anything. You update my account now or I might just forget to format my hard drive before I leave. There we go. Pleasure doing business with you. - [Station Manager] The fire twister tearing through downtown, that's where you need to be, Jane. We've even got our villain, this Scott Nylander creep is pure gold. Disgraced hero firefighter turned mass murderer? That's what you should be chasing. - I don't think that's the whole story, Marcus. I checked out this Scott guy, and this just doesn't add up. - [Marcus] It'll add up when you put his face next to this disaster. Look, that's your job. Let everyone else decide if he did it or not. - No, Garber has something to do with this, I know it. I think that the real story is back at Synco and how all of this got started. - [Marcus] Jane, every other station is running fire twister footage 24/7. And you're out chasing conspiracy theories? You better come back with a smoking gun or don't bother coming back at all. (cell phone beeps) (dramatic music) - We're closed. You need to turn around, ma'am. - Hi, no, I'm with Channel 2 News, I was just here a few hours ago. - They're done talking to the press. - Oh, it's not about that, I left my bag inside, it has my tape. If I could run in and get it before somebody throws it in the trash? - Not gonna happen, Miss. Back it up. Let's go. Back it up. - Yeah. - We interrupt our continuous fire twister coverage to bring you a special report. I'm here talking with the woman who had direct contact with the leader of the eco-terrorists, Scott Nylander. - You need to stop calling them terrorists. They're good people, and that fireman saved my life. - So you don't think they're responsible for the destruction? - They're trying to stop the tornado. While everyone else is running away from it, they're running towards it. Scott and his friends aren't terrorists, they're heroes. - You heard it here first on Channel 2. Scott Nylander and his friends are heroes, not terrorists. And I promise you, viewers, to get to the bottom of who's behind this reprehensible smear campaign against them. - [Announcer] Los Angeles is in a city-wide panic. The massive fire twister has torched a path from Santa Clarita Mountains and is now tearing through downtown, toppling skyscrapers like toys. The disaster toll is fea-- (Carla sighs) - Anthony, how could Synco do this? And how could you not know that any of this was going on? - Why would the CEO of your own company want to destroy it? - When Mitch Garber came to Synco, he promised to position us as world leaders in green fuel. They believed him. I believed him. Now no one is ever gonna see us as anything but those people who created the monster. - Maybe he came to Synco for a different reason. - Yeah, an industrial spy. - Maybe they put him there to wipe out a future threat. Sabotage Synco from the inside. - Could he even do that? - They played hard ball. I've been on the receiving end of that before. - You? Is that what happened? - A few years back, there was that big wildfire in Wyoming. Biggest wildfire in a century. Scott's team got caught. The fire was surging all around them, it was burning its way into the middle. - I lost four men. - But you saved six. - Meeting Carla gave my life purpose again. - You're a hero. They blamed Scott for the deaths of those firemen. - We won't let them get away with it again. (scary music) - Pull into this parking lot over here. - What? - Pull into the parking lot! Stop the car! (tires screech) - What is he doing? - [Barbie] Maybe he finally lost it. - Maybe he found it. (moves into determined music) (intense sizzling) (sirens wailing) (loud explosion) (helicopter blades whir) - The twister passed by just behind those buildings. You can see the anxiety on the faces of these residents. What will they do if the fire twister returns? I'm being told we finally have Governor Aldridge on the line. Governor, thank you for talking to us. What can you tell our viewers? - [Aldridge] I've declared an official state of emergency. I've also activated the National Guard, and they'll be on site as soon as possible. I urge people to please stay in their homes. (scary music) (sirens wailing) (intense sizzling) (car engine rumbles) (Anthony breathes heavily) - Anthony! - What is he doing? - He's going to bait it. - We've gotta stop him. - He can't do that. (cell phone rings) - Anthony, what are you doing? This is not the way to bait it. - I'm not gonna bait it, I'm gonna kill it. - No, we need to do this together. - Someone has to take it out, and it's my responsibility. - It's not your fault, Anthony. - I think I can take it out with a big enough concussion. - And what if you can't, Anthony, then I'm screwed! - I need you to help me kill this thing. This way doesn't make any sense! - Scott, this is the only thing that makes sense today. - Turn back! (heroic music) Anthony, you can't do this! This is suicide! - Tell everyone I'm sorry, okay, Scott? I wanted to help people, not hurt them. - Come b-- (cell phone beeps) - Oh! (intense sizzling) (breathes heavily) (roaring explosion) (Carla sobs) (intense sizzling) (Carla cries) - [Barbie] Why would Anthony do that? - He was trying to be a hero. - Doing what he thought would work. (sirens wailing) - A hero? He died and it was for nothing. - Maybe not for nothing. Look, his theory almost worked. - Did you see the effect it had on the twister? It temporarily disrupted the vortex. - He was on to somethin'. If it'd been bigger and more explosive, (hopeful music) it might have worked. Anthony proved something, the fire twister is drawn to heat. - Yeah, it came toward him like it was some hungry shark. - Yeah, and if we had the right gear we could probably lure that thing to a bigger bomb. - By overpowering the fire with an even bigger explosion. - Kind of like putting out a candle with a firecracker. - But where are we gonna get that kind of explosive power? - I got an idea. - You asked for an engine, you got it. But this stuff, this is military-grade C-4. Had to move heaven and earth to get it. Goin' Red Adair? - Yeah. I'll lure that twister someplace desolate and blow it apart. - Like an oil fire. That's smart. That's a pretty angry beast, though. I don't know if you have enough C-4 to blow it. - It will when I add 1,000 gallons of fuel to the mix. - How the hell are you gonna get a 1,000 gallons of fuel into the middle of a twister? - I was thinking of filling the water reserve of your pumper here with gasoline. - Holy Jesus. You'll be riding atop a small nuke. - With the C-4 onboard, it ought to do the trick. - Yeah, and the explosion will obliterate everything within 100 yards, including you. (heroic music) - I will be fine. I just need to find an enough open space for that kind of explosion. I gotta go. - It's headin' north. - Maybe I can lure it back to Synco. Ought to be enough open space there, huh? - Don't get all heroic on me. Welcome back, firefighter. (mysterious music) (energetic music) (loud slurping) (hopeful music) (loud shredding) (intense music) - [Man] Hey, you, get over here! Hey! Where are you going with that? - [Woman Employee] To my car. - [Man] No, you're not! It's going to the incinerator! - [Woman Employee] But this is my personal stuff! You can't-- - [Man] Nothing leaves this building! Hey! Is anybody else unclear on the concept that nothing leaves this building! (heroic music) - Careful. (mumbles) - [Scott] Get down. - Oh, yeah. - There. All right, it's ready to go. Give it. (intense sizzling) All right, ready? - Yeah. (intense sizzling) - Uh-Oh! Come on, baby, light my fire. - Hey! Is there a problem down there? - Nope, we're okay. What, are you crazy? Mitch had hired private security, I have no idea where these psychos come from. - I can help you. Let me help you. - Mitch gave me the orders to destroy all the evidence. - I'm gonna be a patsy. I cannot go to jail. - So Mitch is behind all of this. Why? - [Shane] I, I don't know. - Help me find out. - This is extremely dangerous and you guys are gonna be ridin' on top of a bomb. A very big bomb. Okay? Let's do it. - Let's kill this bitch! - Yeah! (engine rumbles) (ominous music) - Well, what have we here? Ah, maybe a little Trojan horse action. (camera shutter clicks) (child imitates engine) (sirens wailing) - Cool. - Oh, sir, sir, I'm gonna need you to sign a few forms. - What the hell are you talking about? We're melting down here. - They're for your protection. You asked for them. The new security codes. - Oh, yeah, yeah, these are good. (ominous music) Right, good. What are you doing in here? - I, uh, I wanted to get your perspective, you know, for our viewers. - I already gave you my perspective. - Yeah, well, I was hoping you could go a little deeper. I mean, after all, you are in charge of this company. This company is responsible, you know, for all this devastation. - I see. Tell me, did you ever play golf? - Not really my thing. - You know, that makes sense. You don't really look like a lesbian. Do you know why men play golf? - Um, to suck up to their bosses? - No, no, no, no, no. Golf is a game of precision and control. You see this posture? It's good, huh? You see, you employ a 39-inch club to hit the ball 200 yards at 160 miles an hour all in the hopes of getting it in a little hole that's four and 1/4 inches across. (golf club whizzes) - Well, now I know why men golf. It appeals to the male fascination with meaningless statistics. - Details, that's why men run international corporations and women work at adorable, little jobs to tide themselves over until they can pump out a few kids. - Yeah, are you sure that you've accounted for all the details? - You see, the important thing with golf is to really maintain a good foundation. Legs apart, spine straight, you've gotta really be solid at impact. - Oh, why don't you just cut the crap! (loud crunch) (Jane screams) (dramatic music) (loud thuds) - Shane, come here for a sec. - Okay. - Think hard. Do you have any idea how this woman got into my office? - I, I. - Clean that up. (sirens wailing) - All right, Cap, got a visual on it. We're armed and headin' toward it. Keep all traffic away from the Synco Compound. We're drivin' it back home, Cap. - Yeah, copy that. Engine 17, 47 and 23, stand by. - Logan, you might want to back off, too. - Give us one shot, if it doesn't work, you guys shouldn't be anywhere near us. - Copy that. It's all yours. Be careful, Scottie. All engines stand down. Engine 74 is takin' the lead. Scottie's back on the case, guys. - Good luck, Scott. - [Firefighter] We're rootin' for you. - [Firefighter] Be careful, brother. - [Firefighter] Go whip it's ass, Scottie. - Got your back, Scott. Hey, what's your ETA at Synco? - [Scott] Five minutes. - [V] Take us back to Synco. (intense sizzling) - All right, ladies, it's show time. Let's light it up, take her home. - Okay, Barbie, let's give this bitch a warm welcome. - Copy that. (intense sizzling) - Yes. Yes. (tires screech) (guns are cocked) - Get ready. (cell phone rings) - Really, really? - Yeah? - I filled up the water reserve with gasoline and I'm sitting on top of 20 kilos of C-4. This is a courtesy phone call. - He's bluffing. - Maybe. - Carla, Barbie, when I give you the signal, get down. - Got it. - Keep going, keep going. Everything, quickly, quickly. Everything, you underst? Great, now they're on my doorstep. Shred every last sheet, you got it? Nothing left. - Got it. - Time to get the hell out of Dodge. What's the ETA on the chopper? - Uh, five minutes. - Outstanding. Shane, forget you ever met me, forget everything I ever said to you and everything you ever saw here. Oh, and have yourself a nice day. - Uh. - You're not buyin' this crap, are you? - Don't know, don't care. Kill him! (guns are cocked) Kill 'em all! - Get down now! (loud gunshots) (engine revs up) (bullets clink against metal (screams) - [Daryl] Whoa, whoa, whoa! (energetic music) (loud gunshots) (V screams) (bullets clink against metal) (screams) - Die, you hippie bum! - Yeah! All right! - Every girl should have one of these. - One down, one to go, ladies. - Okay, we're up, girl. Let's send this sucker home. - Come and get it, Smog-zilla! (intense sizzling) (Barbie and Carla scream in excitement) We did it! - [Scott] All right, ladies, it's right where we want it. Hold your fire. - Copy that. - [Scott] We'll come around and bait it from the front. Great job. (firetruck horn honks) - Where are you? No! No, you have to land here! You have to land here! Here! (helicopter blades whir) Here, great! Great, you see me now, good! Good, set it down in this field and I'll jump onboard. - [Pilot] It's too dangerous, sir. The twister's way too close. I can't make a safe landing. - You can do it, set her down! Set her down! - [Pilot] Agh, it's running toward me! I gotta abort, I'm sorry. - No! Look, I'll pay you double. - [Pilot] I'm losing power, I'm losing control! Help, it's getting too close! It's got me! No, agh! (thunderous explosion) - All right, ladies, one last blast and run like hell! (intense sizzling) That's enough, go! - Copy that. Be careful, Scott. I want my hero back in one piece. - Copy that, Dr. Hottie. (optimistic music) Run! Cover your ears, it's gonna be loud! (engine rumbles) (engine revs up) (loud beep) (engine revs up) - Wait, wait! - Come to Papa. (loud beeps) (loud beep) - What the hell is he doing? What is he doing? (loud beep) (loud beep) (roaring explosion) (axe whizzes) (loud crunch) (Mitch gasps) (birds chirping) (optimistic music) - Yeah, whoa, yeah! (Carla and Barbie laugh) - [Carla And Barbie] Whoo! - Yes! - Whoo! - Yes! - Carla, Barbie! - Oh, well, come on. - Carla, Barbie! You all right? - Yeah, we're good. - Are you kidding? We're great! - That was epic! (Barbie laughs) - Hey, Scott! You okay? Scottie, you okay? Hey, Scott, you there? Hey, we heard quite a boom out there. - Yeah, yeah, we're fine. It's, it's done. We owe you for an engine, though. - You'll have to work it off. Hey, the mayor wants you back on the department, firefighter. I might be working for you. - I like the way that sounds. I might need a vacation first, though. - Copy that. You deserve it. - Where are we gonna go? - Some place cool, maybe Iceland? (Barbie laughs) I'd like that. - They don't have fire twisters there, do they? (dramatic drum music)
