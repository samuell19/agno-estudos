It's like the song could still be heard WHEN THE HEAVENS FALL... From the waves of the Mediterranean back to Helsinki and new missions. And to merciless time whipping us forward. Frankly, I can't even read my own articles, post-publication. Clumsy sentences, soulless and uninspiring thoughts. My curse is to rise from the ashes, like a phoenix. The princes had it well organized. We could learn something from them. Don't I pay the highest salary in this country? I've got strict demands. If only we could do something with Springer's resources. I first met Eila during that early spring. My arm had been bothering me the whole winter, and my heart was next. It happens with age. How carefully fate had planned everything... I only realized it after the fact. Smoking is prohibited. Please, come in. As I think about your eyes... I see the shores of a pond and murky pine trees. I wish I had seen it then. I'd like to move to the countryside for a while to compose myself. Look, Olli. The little fire ants of Usko Miettinen. During those times I had often started to think about death. With an ever-growing excitement. What else is there other than work... Work and love. I had no new expectations from either. - Men used to be tougher. - I told my wife, - sex is about to become #a sin again. You guys... It's the forbidden fruit. I live such a dangerous life... At that age, one should consider it. I've seen so many men... Relax. I wonder how many poems have been written about this. If I can brag, this one guy drank his house away. I recently read an interesting article. In the US a 100 years ago a man managed to have three wives. Now it's totally opposite. The conflict between genders continues. Relax. Eila didn't really talk about herself. A typical case. Divorced, with a kid, the dreams of her youth in the past. Was there anything she could be bitter about? Straighten your fingers and wrist and up. Twist and make a fist. And over your stomach. I once met congressman Lamminpää at the clinic. He wasn't too happy with us meeting every other day. Lamminpää was a known figure in the public life. I had long predicted we'd meet some day. "What were his ailments," asked the reporter in me. Old cases came into my mind, a knife attack by a bishop... I found new aspects in Eila. How would you like if I filled in for you? Between two fires. Bloody hell. I read the employer here... Over here, over there... They wreck their hearts. You must be under a lot of stress. I've had the divorce papers ready for five years. Do you love your wife? I think everyone should have someone to love. Where was Lamminpää? Had Eila cried? Oh, Eila... A few routine moves and the magazine knew the facts. Well now, Mrs... It wasn't supposed to be Mother's Day. Can you not be the funny man today? I have a headache. Let's make a new appointment. You'll have time to rest. Just lie down. It's not my business, but... Was there a hidden thorn in those roses? Raise your hands. In war and love the ends justify the means. Daily Truth wages war against hypocrisy and double standards. The gentlemen play their games, but the people have a right to know how tax money is used. Tell me, as a man... Squeeze. How do you get a man to believe that - some pretty day some thing has reached the end? - Tell him... - Squeeze. Tell him like that. Just like that. It's so difficult. The other one tries their best and is just good. How would he take it... I recommended a remote cafe. In a public place Arvo would have to restrain his emotions. Besides, it would be easier for me to do my part. I didn't mention it. This has gotten out of hand. I always make a fool of myself. If it didn't cause agony it was worth nothing. You're just being agitated. Don't make it any more difficult. And I was crazy enough to think that... Think about it. Your wife, your career, and me. Right... It's a mess. Arvo... Let's not ruin the memories. You don't know what this has meant to me. - Write to me if something happens. - Thanks... You won't stop until a man begs for mercy. "Where were my morals," someone asked. I ask where were Eila's and Lamminpää's. Reporter's ethics has to factor in the widest effects. Arvo had a wife, kids. His family worshipped him. You've kept your family private with success. My wife's support is everything to me. You've developed a vital image, what do you think? Humor is necessary. That's what Usko Miettinen says too. He's leaning towards us, is he not? Take the photo now. Come on now, stay still. The first warm day of the summer... Eila thought I was a grass widower, my wife thought I was working. The open air and sea breeze were great for me. My health improved with each day. The shivers subsided, I no longer threw up. Eila's small talk kept me amused. I've suffered from the bliss for five years now. A man would do, but... Not the freedom. What would a woman understand about freedom? Emancipation is a new word to them meaning "take it away, I'll whimper." Look at you talking! Listen, there wouldn't be many women in this world who'd tolerate a man. - Without that one thing... - Well... Would you sleep with anyone for 5,000? For 5,000 I wouldn't sleep with anyone, that's for sure. No matter how attractive they'd be. Let's say he was an older, timid, retired man - who gave you his savings as he's dying soon anyway. Well,. would you do the same? It's different, a man can't fight his nature. Are you going to a woman? Don't forget the camera. I'd look terrible through that lens. As you only photograph models and such. I don't really photograph much. I'm not an expert. Hey, take a photo of me. It serves as a memory. Name it "a woman raised in a barrel." Fine by me. Eila's physical appearance filled my mind with anxiety. She enjoyed the effect a woman could feel with her senses. But, whoever looks at a woman with lust... Why didn't I fall on my knees? Why didn't I banish the devil within me? DAILY TRUTH - FIVE MOST POPULAR WAYS TO COMMIT SUICIDE - "RECOGNIZE CELEBS' FECES" - This calls for a drink. Did they give their permission? - At least three of them. - They should be photographed. I'll shit out the missing. No one will know any difference. Can you make variations? - With lingonberries, air, and diarrhoea medication. - I can help. - I can help a bit but we're in a hurry. - Let's get the headline to the press. Editors and the lab are Daily Truth's most sacred. There the revealing photos are developed. There the reports by journalists and assistants are pieced together. There the experts form an image of the world we occupy. What are you complaining about the voting for? When we write a story that's how it gets out of hand. Hey, Usko. Did you see Lamminpää's story? - How was it? - It was okay. The photos of that bitch could've been better. Write about that "5,000" thing. That money brings us friends. Anything about that orphan beating case? Fuck me, I have the title and everything. "I did it for the love of God". He must've suspected something. Make it bolder and publish it. Lamminpää's debt to life: 5,000 for a one-night stand. - How do you like it? - Huh? Shall I tell everyone we're poets now? "For 5,000 I'd do the minister," brags the nurse. Print it. Um... I'm not so sure about your... style. Do you keep a diary? If you can call notes a diary, then... You can write your diary however you like. But we need people to buy the magazine. Eila's and Lamminpää's relationship was the next issue's main headline. Phone lines were hot and the people wrote about it. Lamminpää was of course furious, but as a professional politician - who had experienced it all saw it in the right context. It was nice that the people were sympathetic towards Lamminpää. The old guy had gone off the deep end. I hadn't heard from Eila. She likely wouldn't contact me. The sudden fame flattered her, yet embarrassed her. To go from nobody to somebody. Humans tend to hate on surgeons more than diseases when it's our turn. But society's abscesses must be pierced. DAILY TRUTH 5,000 FOR A ONE-NIGHT STAND - Hello. - Hello. - Eila Tuomi? - That's me. Express mail, couldn't fit through the door. Must be fan mail. - Bye. - Bye. This was great. Another one? - They're probably over there. - That's right. That's true. - Hi. - You're here too? You invited me. From The First Epistle to the Corinthians: "Love is patient, love is kind. "It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. "It does not dishonour others, it's not self-seeking, it's not easily angered, - "- it keeps no record of wrongs." - Nice presents on the table. - "Love does not delight in evil..." - Must've been worth the 5,000. "It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres." What'd you say about a wedding night together? They're not home right now. Yes, uhm, try the office if it's important. What's that? I don't know anything about that... Nothing at all. Goodbye. - Who was it? - Someone asked for you. Did they even say anything... It was work related. Some emotional woman again. It was Tuomi or Tuominen... I'd really like something to eat, but... It's been such a hard day. Listen, let's go to a restaurant. I hadn't forgotten about Eila. How did this fame affect her, having lived a private life. A journalist who forgets a private person to a "frog perspective" - loses their touch on more important things. The vast panorama of history is a mosaic built from fragments. Everyone is aware of wars' oppression and deprivation - including the leaders of countries. Listen, girl... I'll give my vote to Lamminpää and demand my part of the welfare. Better safe than sorry, Mrs. Tuomi. Your situation is judicially tough. There's no precedent. We lack such legislation - that would guarantee a so-called "intimate judicial protection." Meaning a private person's life is not protected. Fucking hell... Would she give itto me for free... She isn't even ashamed. Fuck. Here, look. Fuck me. Ulla. Don't you know a gentleman keeps it in the right pant leg. DID JESUS USE DRUGS? A MARE IS A MAN'S BEST FRIEND. "My hard luck is that I only love armpits in women. "Only armpits. Everything else in a woman disgusts me." Tuomi who? Oh, it's you. Have you had any of those 5,000 adventures lately? If you won't stop calling we'll print more stories about you. Yes, everything's in a binder. And every word is true. Try to fucking understand! She's started enjoying the publicity. And that's a good thing. You're still here? My husband isn't home. Please believe me. A sensation and a fucking scandal. They say those words like they're spitting. Influence on the masses. That's the thing. - Right. - We publish what the people want. Right, but those photos of yours are sometimes so terrible. You want us to censor everything that's not beautiful and sacred? You always cater to the vilest urges, always. You mean sexual urges, baby? Listen, it's far from sex. - It's gritty realism. - Come on, now... UNESCO says what's right and wrong. "Journalists must commit to positively influencing societies - "ignoring their own interests." Isn't that right? Word for word? A magazine must know its goal. And we don't need to reveal the news source. We don't even need one. - Would you like more? Our responsibility is to the masses. Right, totally ruining some poor person's life. So that you get your satisfaction. Your world-view is so individualistic it's no use. The public is the mouth of Moloch. What? Hello? Nothing. I must admit, I was surprised how the story affected Eila. Listen, now... Eila had lost her job and apartment. Eila was upset. This was not my intention. I suppose no. You're blaming me for it? Eila couldn't realize that truth is always one hundred percent. I had to be incorruptible, ruthless, or I had to give up. And betray my last ideal. No, never. About that apartment... Call me tomorrow in the office and we'll come up with something. Yeah, that's right. Come on, now. Chin up. The same woman? Won't even say her name. They usually stop calling soon. Just say a dirty word to them. You should start taking it easy. Dear dad... You can't sing about Rannanjärvi, for Rannanjärvi is dead and gone. And by his grave did someone bring a marble stone. Marja was right, as always. But was it purely reason what was developing between me and Eila. I didn't try to explain to Marja. It would've been profane. And Marja hadn't noticed my intellectual side in ages. As the second summer issue came out - the so-called "proper" papers questioned Daily Truth's morals. A situation too familiar in this promised land of jealousy. Eila moved to an apartment owned by the magazine surprising the Pharisees. As we printed it we received letters of sympathy from across the country. Let's save this one. It goes on my wall. Charity has even been labelled irresponsible in certain groups. Which one of you is the father who gives a child an ABC-book instead of bread. Daily Truth helps in distress without caring about fashion. - This is a passenger. - Yes. I don't know what Eila learned from this, for better or worse. The work was most important, I couldn't focus on a single person. I lost Eila, but I couldn't forget... AS A WHORE IN A MADHOUSE. WAS PRESIDENT MANNERHEIM AN UFO? HUMAN FLESH TASTES GOOD!! MY HUSBAND HAS THE SMALLEST ONE IN FINLAND I've had it with your sexual education programs. Can't a human being long for romance? A bit of tenderness. Yeah right. What about that fugitive who killed that crazy peasant? What of it, Jussi? I went ahead and wrote about it. Yeah but what about the "wetting the bed" thing in the army - that the Major talked about? And uhm... I tried to write about it but couldn't find any info on either. You'll learn it afterwards. Yeah but I need accurate info and I can't get any. What do you pay to the judge for then? One must have journalist's ethics. And accurate info, facts, must be found. Listen, Olli, I met Arvo Lamminpää. He's crazy fucking mad to you about that shit story you wrote. - Is that Meri? - Yes. Meri, can I call you Olli? You need to finish that one thing. About those people getting thrown out of their apartments. A family of three got thrown out. The people must hear about it. Let's go talk about it then. - Olli, listen, you've had too much. - Meri will take care of it. - I will. - But we can't do it by ourselves. Meri, the people need to know about it. Eila had to accept a job offer in haste. The care-taking needs of the disabled Lauri Bergström had certain tones from the very beginning. A creature relying on instinct, as women often do, is an easy victim. I could see how Bergström set the trap. How he appealed to motherly and procreational instincts in turn. Hips forward, and jump. Canes, hips forward, and jump. Legs together, balance... Canes, hips forward, and jump. Good, forward, and jump. - Mum. - OK, then. Now we'll eat and then we go to bed. - What do you want to take with you? - I want these. - These small cars. - Bought a new car for me. - Yes, mum bought you a new car. - Mum bought. Does fate shape our nature, or vice versa? Philosophers have debated about it for thousands of years. Human beings puzzle me greatly. Wherever I may roam, my path is marked with blood and tears. A dark shadow casts upon glory and joy. I'm the cheapest servant before the crowd. One must always be ready like "Marlbrook who went to war." When I saw Eila I realized she had been in my thoughts constantly. How did she affect me? What did it take... Eila, hey... Eila! - You startled me so... - Hop on, I'll give you a ride. I'm just taking him to the kindergarten. Well, you got a job then? - Yes. - That's nice. - Bye then. - Bye. I'll never forget those days. Their relationship slowly became clear to me. Bergström sought someone to release his repressed urges. And Eila was prepared to sell herself to a wealthy man. Neither would readily let go of their catch. I thought about Bergström's old mother. Give me the bottle. What comes to mind when you look over there? I think you do understand. Words are not necessary. Hey, Eila... are you crying? Come fast. Would you help a little... Let me grab the rock, there... It was time to give Bergström and his peers a lesson. He needed help and understanding. But not the kind of balsam that seeped from Eila's lap. His place would be in a suitable institution. I found out that Eila had a day off from work. It's reporter Meri from Daily Truth, good afternoon. Yes, can you give me an interview? Oh no, about music... Right. Yes, I've read about you. That reminded me... We're doing this thing about the emotional life of the disabled. Right, right... Completely confidentially of course. Like the poet Veikko Antero Koskenniemi said... "We carry our bodily faces for all to see." "Only love has seen the face of our souls." Right... To me target and expression are the same. Like... chinese writing. How much pain and loneliness have you suffered to talk so lucidly. Together we've learned and... found. Bergström chose his words carefully. He analyses a person quickly and nervously. I wanted to ask frankly, to tackle the mystery of Eila. But I didn't want to scare Bergström. Nor break the fragile trust. We were like a serpent and a frog. I can caress the one and the same breast for hours. Like with a feather or... pliers. Every time. - Right. And then the other. Everything melts into the same feeling. One comes back to the same loved one, over and over. Like a good poem. How often do you read this poem? Our culture god damn it. It's a culture of positions. A Japanese motivational poster can be found in every logger's house. Even when it means new aspects of a loved one and not... Some fucking horse riding school. But surely that disability limits you... That's what they say anyway. It's easy to think if one is disabled that... Everything's just acrobatics and apparatuses. Put this in your story with emphasis. Is your partner just a sex object to you? Oh no. What was my life before Eila... Let's say a lover of mine... Bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh... Soul of my soul. May Kreeta call you Esko, or Esko call you Kreeta... Have you read anything by Menninger? I've had everything through my loved one. She's more to me than life and death. Before life, Bergström was just a cripple boy. I couldn't forget how his under- privileged peers never complained. They fed their families, they fought for a better life. Lauri devoted himself to his urges, to his lust. I must say I learned a lot. Can you send a copy of the issue to me? I happen to have one with me right now. As a sample since you're not familiar. - Learn what it's about. - Thank you. Truth doesn't burn away, but it can burn worse than fire. Lauri Bergström naturally got shocked having learned Eila's true nature. Eila naked, without the all-blinding cataract of romantic love. I, the disappointed idealist, understood Bergström, - but I wish I had understood sooner, and the tragedy could've been avoided. Who knows, a kind of fatalism has always fascinated me. Winds blow above us. - Why the flowers? You didn't have to. - Don't you want them? Listen, these are for mourning. Meri, how the fuck will you explain this? Goddammit! It was supposed to be, we have witnesses... - Olli, goddammit! - Now would be best to... It should've been about one single poor family... ...that I could understand this! Two days before our commercial negotiations! Well... That's how we make the money. Sending compliments should calm the situation. Those who made it have failed before. And I've tried telling you big money rests on thin ice. What's wrong with you, Olli? - Cunthead. - Fucking art prose... Didn't you learn anything from your mistakes in your youth, Olli? That's it, then. But if you screw this up... It's no use crying. - What is this? - Vice-mayor Edwin Salo's compiled sins. Irony won't save you. It's either your or Edvin's head at stake. DAILY TRUTH SEX PROBLEMS OF THE DISABLED SOLVED NO ACROBATICS - NO MOBILITY AIDS INSTEAD: EILA TUOMI This is Meri. No. You're... No. It's not true. I have nothing to do with it. - I swear with two fingers on the book. - Whose small fingers... Yes, but that was... Should have balls chopped off if we went according to the law. Hang in there, I'll be there right away. Don't think about it. Don't think about anything. I'll be there soon. This profile's gonna cost a lot, but what can you do... Bergström's tragic death shocked me. Was it right to judge his actions by the same scales as ours ours who've been allowed to live a healthy life. Even Edwin Salo's appearance couldn't make me feel better. - Hey, it's you, Meri. Hello. - Hello. Whiskey on the rocks. Same for him. - Haven't seen you in a while. - I've been sick. - Do you visit Helsinki often? - Not really. Throw your worries away, Olli. Let's find a couple of whores and go to a hotel. Liquor and new women. For me it's always one or the other. Doctor's recommendation. Eila had read the latest issue and drawn her own conclusions. She was close to a breakdown. Eila wasn't one of those who could put her problems aside. I had found values in her as a human being - that inherited riches and education can't make up. I felt responsible for her. Like the ancient Chinese for someone whose life they had once saved. With money, then? It helps you to get past the worst. You lost your job too. I'll let you write the amount on the cheque. Fucking hell if only I were a man! Hit me harder. Go ahead, don't stop. Hit me. Do you have tissues or something... My mouth is bleeding. I couldn't give my ear to Eila like Van Gogh to his friend. You know the story. But an unexplainable feeling of joy filled our night. Eila... Do you know where martyrs got their strength from? Singing praises while lions mauled them. From faith. Humans must have something to believe in so strongly that - nothing else matters. - You're not listening. When their hidden and repressed suicidal urges had won. When a lion attacked they opened their arms to them. It's lust. Eila. I love you. Never turn away. We found each other, two human beings. A volcano erupted that was eating itself inside out. Look what mum brought you. Have you become friends with Hööpö? There you go. There's another one. Did you bring me anything to drink? - That's not me either. - That one? - No, it's some boy. - A boy... Passion forced us into caressing and violence. I'd go to jail if you kept quiet. Dante reserved us a place in his Hell to linger in anguish for an eternity. Marja? It's me, honey. Right. Someone might be snooping in. No, I was in Kööpenhamina. Right... I'm calling from a bar. Yeah. Right. Of course. Yeah. Yes. Bach, so what? I can't, someone might be listening in. So what if I'm raising my voice? Divorce? What? A divorce... It's not about that. Listen, Marja... Goddammit, Eila. Emotions had taken over me and I didn't know what Eila wanted. Her temperament and personality were a result of volatility. Hööpö! Even the ancient Ovid expressed masterfully how women can - simultaneously experience intense emotion and the pettiest calculation. - I don't want to go. - Let's go outside to play. Could you go to the pharmacy? - We'll go in the elevator. - In the elevator... This is Olli. Listen, tell Usko I've got lots of material. It's the rowdiest thing ever, damn it. No, I won't tell... Listen. tell Miettinen to keep the column open. I prayed to Satan for strength. I wanted to subdue Eila like our ancestors did to their females. For like a circus beast can suddenly go wild - so do women have the primitively relentless spite against their victors. Is there something wrong with me? Of all primates, only human vagina opens forward. Why must you always defeat me? Give everything away. Love until death. Fuck. To a journalist working for Daily Truth nothing humane is strange. I've witnessed euthanasia, I've been to a whorehouse. I've played strip poker with church leaders. I won't be invited to the annual president's ball but they talk about me. My guest list is like a detective's archive. I've mastered hypnosis, psychoanalysis, and telepathy. Yet Eila Tuomi is a mystery to me. I am but a poor wanderer, wretched, on earth, - and I travel a perilous journey. I am searching forlorn for the land of my birth.. Eila looked at me and her face spoke of our mutual secret, and guilt. Whether we wanted it or not, a psychological process had begun in us. So that they'd be one. - Smoke. - Smoke from a car, yes. - From toys too. - Dad will come in a Volkswagen. - ...backs up. - You'll go to dad's home. Tuomi. Who's that? Who? Me? - Isn't it nicer to be with dad rather than strangers? - No. You get to drive a Volkswagen and dad will show you his work factory. - It turns like this. - Yes, it turns like that. Fine then. I'll call. - Dolls... - And a cat. - Yes. - Where Dad resides. What was it about? How did they know to call here? They said I'm gonna get fired. Fired? My goodness, I hope not. - Come on, Hööpö, let's go. - Let's go. Ave Caesar morituri te salutant. Eat a little more. Dad will be here soon. - In a Volkswagen. - That's right. Hööpö! It's daddy! Cheer up, Eila! Chin up, get ready to work. Salo comes to Helsinki for a "conference." Swing, swing, swing that pickaxe into the mountain Swing it with a smile on your face Trust in your strength of youth Don't stop swinging that heavy hammer - I want to die. - Call the doorman. We shouldn't stop what we've started Hey-ho! Hey-ho! Hey-ho! The thing is, if I were born in... Let's say to a family of architects... My political views and development would've been on the "right" side. But once I shoved my head between... ...the legs of Salo's wife I became what I am today. Oh, are you a communist? I'm a member of the labour movement. And that's it. But one would think you're a manager. Let's close the doors... Eetu... Eetu... Come to bed. Let me take off your shoes so you can get comfortable. I lack... education. I'm just an errand boy. Nobody cares what I think. - Are you listening at all, Aila? - It's Eila. - You said Aila. - Oh, right, Aila. - I was kidding. - My memory never fails me. I might forget a face but names stick with me. Our company that went to war in 1939... There was Aalto, Karppila, Rästänen, Etto, - Eräpuu, Honkanen, Heinonen, Vuotari, - Iisakainen, Isotalo, Kukkonen... Keinonen, Kettunen. Aw, Eetu. Let's order some ice. So many were missing by the end of it... Ice with champagne? Oh no. Bloody hell, I got emotional there. Where do you work as a manager? Nobody takes a human being any more... Aila, feel my heartbeat. A human is a human, even if it came from a monkey. Let's get naked, Aila. Give me a hand. Right, there... Tell me a story about it. If you knew what controls politics... It's better this way. Give me a long kiss. I said long. If I could live those years again... Liquor, whores, sleeping cars, hotels... Tell me your story, Eetu. Go ahead. I had only one guiding light in war for five fucking years. - And then the dogs attacked. - Eetu... Nothing was good enough. - Other than Tanner and me. - Come on, now. Geez... - Eetu, stop. Take it easy. - Stay still until I get it inside. What is it with you... I didn't fuck her. What is this? And you? Yeah, you. Kill or be killed, isn't it like that? I should've guessed. I'm getting old. Light? At least there's room for the young ones. I don't give a shit about the photos, it's the chatter that's embarrassing. Is the tape recorder on? - We didn't go that far. Just people living their lives. I had to take a fresh face... You know the usual. It's just old man's ranting, and... Champagne's gone bad. Let's go to a bar. Will you change that Lamminpää story from the spring? Fuck me, I almost fucked your girl. But I didn't. If you write I fucked her, it's the worst lie ever about me. Whores, sleeping cars, hotels... Eetu, please tell me. I had only one guiding light... - ...for five fucking years. - Eetu... Women who are intelligent, and women who have heart... Which ones keep the world running? Our Odyssey started there... Penelope back home and Circe next to me. The metaphor may be hollow but represents my mood. Mad love. Eila demanded, forced me to write about her whole life. I studied her, her past, her soul, like Dante studied Inferno. Eila made me her slave, an involuntary pawn of her crazy plan. Did she ever love me like I loved her? We went to a place where Eila first met her ex-husband. And the place where her kid was conceived. My connection to the magazine got interrupted, though it didn't cut off. My work is more important to me than all the joys and pleasures in the world. I need to call the office to send my salary to - a bank somewhere along our trip. The guiding light of my whole life and work has been a dream of a better world. - You should meet mum. - Where lions and lambs drink from the same spring. Naturally lion drinks first, thus materializes order and justice. For the lamb also gets to drink. Listen... Let's go soon. I feel like... Hey... Open the door! Eila, goddammit! Hey, Eila! Open the door it's raining! Open the door! Goddammit! Nature meant only pretty landscapes and postcards to Eila. To me nature is the root of all power. I compare my job at Daily Truth to that of a religious preacher. We drove across the country. I was reading the map. We often returned to the same places. We uncovered Eila's soul layer by layer like an onion. You wouldn't happen to remember where the liquor store is? I spent my last bit of energy, each cycle bringing me closer to death. There was something morbid in Eila's caring touch. She whipped me into a state where I couldn't get by without her. That was her plan, I see it now. We're in the middle of a game. 1.30 pm... Marja, I can't hear you. Listen, everything's gone south. Honey, don't leave me. This is hopeless. Goddammit. I'm sorry, I can't. Don't cling to me then. Fuck off if I'm not good enough. All you're good for is complaining. I wonder if you... Keep staring at me like a fish out of water. Show me some love. I tell you, come kick me after you die. The lonely poet Baudelaure wondered what are the women doing in the church. What would they say to God. Hurry now souls, our time is precious. Our years go by like a stream. Jesus won't let a sinner indulge. He'd grant bliss to everyone out of mercy. Choose a path that leads to life. Soon our day will come to an end. - Eila's childhood had been pretty and whole. - Let's go! I wrote down the emotional memories like a machine incapable of feelings. Was the artist in me dying? And the rest would be just documents and revelations. - Here Eila had first fallen in love when she was young. - Tell me more. She told about it colourfully with the smallest details. That even some contemporary writers would be jealous of. But I can't recall a single word. That moment is a collection of nightmarish images. Like Eila had already partially escaped beyond me, wherever. May God have mercy on her. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Tell me more. Keep going. Goddammit! The closer we got to Eila's birthplace the quieter she got. She was restless as it was in our reach. If I had anticipated... Would I have had the energy to change fate? Before history, humans must be humble, and submit. It's the end. Few have been given the gift of seeing. But do not be jealous of your part, see your tears as well. Without noticing, sometimes, as if playing with fire, - Eila gave hints where she'd like our trip to end. She could no longer return. But did I have a right to it, having bound my fate with Eila. Tie it tight. If I can make the world better than what I was given, - I can say my job and life has been fulfilled. Fulfilled. With good will we could eradicate unemployment, - within a year defeat world famine, - within two years pollution, and within five cancer. But what good is it if accident befalls our souls. DOES THE BIBLICAL PREDICTION REFER TO YEAR 1972? Eila died like she had lived, for herself. Wouldn't it be better to let her memory disappear into the abyss as well? It would be easy. But could I ever look at people in the eyes again? Could I hold my child thinking it might have to go through the same as me? MY BELOVED DAUGHTER, SISTER AND MOTHER Eila's story shall be a warning to all of us. My duty is to earn money without hiding anything. For isn't Eila in all of us? A bit of selfishness and lust for power. Destructive, unsuppressed urges. I must confess... Eila's case shows us the human cost of the freedom of the press. What duties gives us the right to stand as guardians of truth in our time? TRANSLATION: themagician @KG PROOFREADING: deisto
