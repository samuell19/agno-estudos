We're acquainted. Worked together a few times. He has integrity. Being an actor is destiny. Being an unknown is also destiny. To have one's acting universally acclaimed... ...but still remain unknown - now, that's truly destiny. Kar Fai and I... started out around the same time. He's gone through some rough patches. I think any actor who's experienced... those kinds of ups and downs... would be a performer of the highest order. Leung Kar-fai... Director, it's Poon Kar Fai. Poon Kar Fai? You're kidding me? Never heard of him. I finally realized why I'm given this award tonight Because even after the shoot... I have no idea whatsoever what the director wanted. Don't think I'm damning him. I'm actually giving him praise. Miss. Pervert! Cut! Hit him harder. Miss. Pervert! Sorry! What are you sorry about? I hit too hard... That's the whole point! Why didn't you complete your lines? Your face... Director, I bruised him. No... Fiona, your performance is good. But Fai's reaction seems so-so. Let's do it again. But we've already done 7 takes! I doubt if she's got the hang of it. Can't you shoot it another way? I'm not here to train amateurs. I'll do it softer... Soft or hard is not the point. Your skill's so indescribable it's beyond me. Pawky Fai... What'd you call me? What did you just call me? Sorry, Mr. Fai, sorry... Mr. Fai My name is Poon Kar Fai! Watch your manners. Mr Fai... Your scenes are done. You're free to go. Can't you see me leaving now? I'm crossing the harbour in this car. Don't tell me you're leaving me here? The car's full. That only points to your incompetence... and mismanagement, Mr Production Assistant. Get in my way and it'll be me apologizing. Make room, director! Shut the door! Go... Asshole! Were you the art director on this film too, Dad? I can never get enough of Mui Yee's impeccable acting. When she's maternal... you want to reward her for her devotion. When she acts the slut... you almost want to strangle her. Honestly, Dad, now... ever gone out with these actresses? Wipe your tongue! All the film stars back then... were like friends and family. You're not owning up coz Mom's here. You two keep it up. I'm going to fetch soup from the kitchen. See. You made Mom angry. It's you who made her mad. I've paid the electricity bill for you today. I'll return you the money tomorrow... together with this month's allowances. Your Dad and I don't need the money. Keep it for yourself. Better to have another bowl of soup! That toilet stinks of beer. Grab your stuff... Hurry up! You don't have dialogue today. Any scripts? Sit here... What's with this horror-movie smoke? Good morning, Mr Fai. Mr Fai. Excuse me, but you're not completely changed yet. Explain completely changed? I'm afraid your feet might show. Why do you want to show my feet? Are they going to be exhibits for the court? Sure... Any scripts? Filing page by page again? You're the court typist. Start typing once we roll. Don't make any sound though. We're recording sync-sound. Understand? No need to rush! Still waiting for la Diva. I know. Pardon, pardon! One more picture! Niki, confident the rating will be high for this show? Hope so.. hope it'll be good. Excuse us everyone. OK, thanks. Niki, we're ready to shoot. Excuse us. Inspector Fong. On the day of 18th March this year, were you the first person to arrive at the warehouse... the scene of the crime? Yes. Why did you open fire at the suspect... ...now deceased? He took hostages and was uncontrollably agitated. I was worried he'd endanger their lives. So I decided to open fire on him. The time was 12 midnight. Lights were off and completely dark when you opened fire... It was you who were endangering people's lives. I had to try something. Try? You meant to kill the suspect... In 2005 he attempted robbery. The incident left your wife injured and permanently paralyzed. It was vengeance, wasn't it? No. Liar! You're giving false statement! Order! Order! Cut! Weren't you told to make a stir immediately... right after Niki's interrogations. How can the judge react if you don't cause a ruckus? What do you want exactly? How do you expect them to react? Think a word from you and they'll turn award-winning performers? They're extras. What do you expect from what they're paid? Besides, this is a modern day court. The judge will kick anyone out if they cause a stir! You think we're still in Ancient China? Maybe we should act like Manchus? And here! Jury duty means at least college education. How can you have punks sitting in this box? Sure. Even triads can go to university. This is killing me! Sorry. I'll switch them right away. Miss. Stop giggling. Type with your fingers. Listen with your ears. Stop turning round to ogle me. Why get all worked up? People who don't know you must think you're hysterical. Can't you see it. Directing, writing, acting - everything's so under par. I'm doing everyone a favour by making a fuss. We're here just for today's shoot. Why bother? At least you have dialogue. I'm sitting idly, yelling "Order! Order!" It's the same shit. We're in this business long enough to know this industry... can't attract the Brightest, nor feed the Best. Just let it be. You're wasting energy tussling with them. Mr Fai, this is my phone number. Let's have a drink when you're free. I'm called for tomorrow's shoot. What about you? Will we see each other? Excuse me. This is my stop. My name's Faye Ng. My friends say I should change it. Do you think I need a stage name? How about "Faye Lure"? What? I... I really want to be a movie star. You're such a terrific actor. Can you teach me? First learn to speak proper Cantonese, then talk about acting. Stop up ahead. This is where you live? Let me pay this time. Driver, it's on me... Let me! Paying for 2. Thank you. Thank you, master! Goodbye, master! It's money wasted repairing this oil-guzzling wreck. Get rid of it. How about getting rid of you! Repair it, and you'll pay me a bundle. Dump it, and you'll save a bundle. Which sounds better to you? How can I get around without a car? Think you're some movie idol? Think you'll be rampaged by hordes of frenzied fans? Your attitude needs adjustment. Tune it. Should have been your partner when I had the chance. Better to suffer the smell of exhaust fumes than... to suffer other people's whims and dispositions. The glory of self-awareness! 8 years ago, in my last movie role, I was already playing a white-haired fogy. If I'd continued, by now I'd be playing 1000-year-old fossils! Blame your parents for your unremarkable looks. It's your misfortune. Better a hound in a garage than a dog on a movie set Tell me which role, which show... that I didn't poured my guts into? Doesn't mean anything... if you don't kiss the right ass. Producer's birthday. Did he he get a plasma TV from you? Casting director's housewarming. Did she get chandeliers? No? Ever wonder why you're out of luck? Don't tell me I need to sleep with Hong? Depends on her mood. How about licking her toes? If that's what she likes. Have you? I wouldn't be playing old fogies if I had. You'd be a 1000-year-old fossil if you did. Ms. Hong's just put through a long distance call. Have a seat. Thanks. Actually, your contract is ready for you here. Sign it if you have no problem. Miss, this must be some mistake. Just one single show per year? Well, you didn't exactly complete all your shows last year. It wasn't really... in the best interests of the company. You got it the wrong way round, miss. The company didn't provide me with enough work. It's not that I wasn't willing to work. That's why one show per year makes more sense. You'll be recompensed for additional shows anyway. This will be fairer for all parties. A single show per year? What will I live on? I'm wasting my time with you! Fai! What a coincidence! What's up? You're looking good. Nothing compared to you. A lot slimmer here. Ekin, you've arrived! You look fabulous in the new commercial. You saw it? We need to talk. Got it signed? Let's do lunch. Order some drinks. You have to make time to do our anniversary show. Why don't you take time... to have a closer look at the contract first? Half dozen, please. I thought you might be filming tonight What film? Down the street. Watched the re-broadcast of your early shows. When will we ever see such amazing dramas again? In my next life. I am so grateful to receive this award tonight. So many people I need to thank. Come to think of it, more people need to thank me... than I've to be grateful for, so... So, forget it. For the directors who keep calling me to auditions... but never use me in their films, I'm eternally grateful. For never having that privilege. As for my movie... Hollywood's doing the remake. With Brad Pitt! Our movie copied Hollywood. Now they're copying us. So who's the author here? I should be overjoyed tonight, but thinking about it... Last year you gave this same award to a real jerk. Damn it! There's a few more extras coming. Qiqi, we're almost ready to shoot. Fine. Edison, where's the others? The toilet. Must be tough to take them on location yourself. Can't be helped. May's ready to give birth. Excuse me... We'll confirm tomorrow's booking later. I won't bother you. I... I never meant to break up with you. It was you who packed up and left. You've the nerve to say you didn't? I surely did not. Did not! You threw my stuff out the door. The neighbours had to call the cops. Stupid... A total jerk when you're drunk. You're senile. Can't remember anything! It wasn't how you remembered it. Says who? Always complaining about me... Your acting's so shitty! No talent at all. Change your career! Stop wasting time. You never understand anything I say. You never knew what I meant. How could I not understand? Speak up. You have no idea. You have any idea what I mean? What are you trying to say? What's acting... what is it really? Is this acting for you? Ever seen a drunk In my line, act like this? I'm acting all the time. They can't Don't care if they're triad boss or what... It's so wrong. Always putting out a smile They have it wrong. My acting's flawless now. Better than any movie queen! So wrong... so break a bottle! Break bottles when you're drunk. Not again! It's always the same. Here. Drink up. Have you ever once acted correctly? Here... bottom's up. Drink. It's all wrong. Never change, do you? When will you get out of the habit? When can I see your parents again? The marriage might be off but we can still keep in touch. Yes, sure... They really cared about me. Let's have lunch soon, OK? All wrong. Everyone's wrong. You're the only one right. Never have been right. Do you understand? Crappy scripts! Feigning to be something profound! What bullshit! OK, you're right... Never been right. Cheque please! What did they know? Got it all wrong. Stop that! Everything's wrong. Enough! Wrong! You stank up the house! Cleaning up after you every time. Also, your snoring... is worse than before. Cursing even in your dreams. Did I curse you? You dare? I'd kick you off the bed. Was I swearing at other people? What do you think? Stop drinking. It'll be the end of me. Put your trousers on. I'm gonna puke. Next. Faye? Why are you here? You don't have any call today. But May told me I have a booking at 12. May, Faye's booking tonight... why wasn't I told about it? Why didn't you mark it? Fine. Go have the baby. I'll fix the mess. Faye, tonight's call have to be cancelled. But why? I've already taken leave today. Nobody to take you to location. Qiqi, why can't you take me? I'll be busy on the set of the triad street fight. When they're skirmishing, I can be yelling for help as a passerby. Wait. I'll sort it out. Cousin, Qiqi here. Problems with the girl you chose tonight. Can I have Mrs. Lam find someone to replace her? Can you take me to the set? What? Take me... to movie location? I'm just the domestic. Yeung, can you chaperone tonight? You and I... go to... You're in China? Can't you come back immediately? Be... in a movie? I can't! Where to? Mongkok. Where in Monkok? None of your business! What time? It's not right for you. Don't make trouble. I'll do it this one time only, for your sake. Let me explain what this scene is. The john appears. You come up to him. Up here! Closer. Ask him... look at me when I'm talking. Ask him, you wanna come? You wanna come? Go where? To have sex! I understand. Yes... You sure? Then let's t try it. Positions, everyone! Fine. Director, we're ready to shoot. Ready! Set. Roll camera! Take one! Action! Cut! Her positions all doubled up. The acting's terrible! Dumb broad! How many times do I have to repeat it? How many times do you need to hear it again? Don't hide behind him. Come forward a bit. You're both doubled up. How can we shoot this? Miss! If I've told you once, I've told you a hundred times... What are you standing behind him for? Come forward. Head extra! I have no idea how a hooker acts. Don't panic. Don't let them frighten you. 2 things. Thrust your bosoms out. First thing a john looks at are your tits. Your figure is what you're selling. Second thing is when you look at him, you've got to make him feel you're attracted to him. You really want to shack him. Try it. You're comin'? The focus of your eyes softer. You're comin'? Good. Keep the lewdness to a minimum. Only 2 kinds of girls are prone to it. Ancient hookers. And terrible actresses. Maybe you can try imagining... that you've stood a whole day without a client. You need the cash. You need to feed your baby. Baby? Imagine you have one. Prostitutes have their reasons. You need money desperately. To buy milk powder for your baby. There's no self-esteem left. OK? Go on. Be confident. Positions. Ready! Clapboard in. Wait. What are you doing? Are we set? Mark it. Take 6. Action! Sir... Comin' with me? How much? You're my type. Special rates. Cut! Fine. Let's move on. Should have gone for a close-up. Let's set up for the next shot. How was my performance? Not bad. You've even made up dialog yourself. I was thinking, if I failed this pickup... I wouldn't be able to feed my baby, pay the rent... Sent money to mom and dad. The way you hold the cigarette looks authentic. Sure. I've been observing you. Your girl looks promising. She's OK. We'll call you if we need her again. Call Qiqi. I'm just helping her out. Whatever. As long as it pays. You keep it. Even hookers get paid. Take it. Come on. OK. Let's splurge it on drinks. It's only $300. Won't even buy me 2 rounds. I know a place where we can get "dizcont". Discount you mean? Master! Morning. Why're you here? You were so drunk, I had to take you to home. You've so many wonderful DVDs. I wanted to watch them all... I must have fallen asleep. These are what I picked to watch. I've heard so much about this. It's really good. Can you... lend... Why don't you... go back to bed? I'll go through them. So... Finish watching this. Then go home. That's all. I'm going out to buy something. Hell! Master... By the time I get back, you should be gone. Best newcomer-Poon Kar Fai. Is Fai here? He's out. He'll be back soon. Tell him to call me. OK. Bye. Master, you're back? I found lots of charcoal. Why don't we have a BBQ? Don't have a BBQ pit. No pit? Then why all this charcoal? What's up? You said you wrapped early last night. Why is she still with you this morning? Is she getting paid double or triple overtime? What're you rattling about? Nothing. There's always something. Let's drop it. Faye has a call for tomorrow. Should I accept it? Feel like helping me out once more? Ready? Action! Stop! Freeze! Cut! It's obvious she's a stuntman. The disguise's too conspicuous. Can't we find a female stand-in? We're not prepared for one. What about her? Guess what? I'm asked to be the stand-in. Standing for what? Fai, 500 dollars. OK? What stand-in? Stand-in for what? 1,000.00 What stand-in? $1,000! Say yes! Never mind! I'll be fine. $1,000 agreed! Thank you. Master, which way do I fall? Get changed... This way... or that way? Freeze! Stop! Don't run! This last one was good. But a little soft on the landing. Freeze! Don't run! The cop aren't co-ordinated. Fix it. Hurry. Stop! Freeze! Don't run! Director, it's a good take. Not bad... I'm fine. Was that fun? The director wants to do it again. You're sure? No problem. I'll keep falling till you're satisfied. Freeze! No compensation? It's work injury. Can't she claim for that? She's not under contract. How can she make claims? It's your fault for letting her do stunts. I'm not working for you. I'm just helping you out. The two of you can wipe your hands off just like that. I'm here for the long run. Medical expenses? Here, I'll pay. $500. Does that cover it? I'm taking it for her. Let's get out of here. Master, will Qiqi... ever let me work again? Don't worry. She gets over her tantrums... in a matter of days. I'm so sorry to mess things up. Don't know if it's your misfortune or mine. Let's eat. Fai is actually very talented. Always hassling me to take him to the studio and watch the actors work. So it was grandmaster who took him into acting? Needless to say. The truth is, Set Designer Poon here... taught me to build sets. Hammering and slogging as construction laborer... Starting at the bottom builds character. Is that the truth! And when he was 19, he was discovered by talent scouts... He auditioned. Captured a juicy role in his first movie. Won Best new-comer in the Film Awards. Then he was signed up for the TV station? TV's nothing serious. Not worth caring about. Didn't you give him a lift to the station on his first day? It was on my way. I'd just talk to Faye. She's born in the year of Ox. Same as me. So what? She's only 20. 36 years younger than me. 36 years! What on earth are you thinking about, Mom? Can't fathom what's on young people's mind. I've been in movie business over 20 years. Never failed to tell who has star quality. Fai had his day in the limelight. Do you think... I have a chance of succeeding in movies? Will I be famous? Appeal. It boils down to popular appeal. Remember, the public chooses you. You can't choose them. See? She looks like Hina. This angle she looks like Ryoko Hirosue. There... just like Takako Mastu. Fine... good enough. Let's put some makeup on. Hurry. Right side's more photogenic. Left side. Where're you from? I'm from Hang Zhou. Hang Zhou? Hang Zhou is famous for their pretty girls. Is the red more suitable than the white? Red will clash with the background. It has to be applied around this area. Shoulders to the upper arms. As for the colors... Makeup for the eyes should be more "smoky". Darker still. Set it on her sleeves. That way... This way? Suppose we try... The pattern here. Something bigger. That's too small. Not bad. Suits her fine. Do you really want to go into show business? Aren't I already in it? Not really. You're doing petty work as an extra and stand-in. You're waiting haphazardly on the fringe for chances to happen. What do you have in mind? If you're serious about it... you should start from basics Imagine traveling on the subway. Suddenly you're struck by a stomach ache. The pain gets worse. It becomes violent. You're a girl-decorum forbids any public display. Hide the agony. Suddenly a rumble in your stomach. A furious burst of gas rages down. Impossible to hold it in, you break wind. It's a whopper. People round are staring at you. Keep going! To make it as an actress here, slimness is compulsory, not fine acting. Step on it. So steep? Full speed. Mind your form. Help! Stop! Reaction here first... Right here. Grab that. Look terrified! Can I stay overnight? No way. Impossible. Imagine one night I'll have too much to drink, And you emerges from your bath, all wet and steamy. Guess what'll happen? Master, you always fall asleep drunk. Can't you be more pure hearted? I'm not going to bite you. Thanks, master. I'll move my things over. Me, I'm pure. I'm not worried... It's you I fear. Hello. I'm Faye Ng. Faye, why choose a bulldog for a pet? Don't let its fierce look deceive you. Its' actually sweet and gentle. This show's for kids, not cads. She's promising. What's up, Fai? Ms. Hong! Heard you switched career paths successfully. I was forced to do so. Don't be petty. Hard feelings don't last overnight here. Let's have a chat. We're starting a new series. There's a suitable role for Faye. Interested? A drama series? 3-year contract. $8,000 per month. That's just the basics. Commercials are extra. It's quite substantial for a newcomer. She's already getting $10,000 per shoot doing movies. THAT'S substantial for a newcomer. You have to trust me. Trust your partner. It's not that I don't trust you, but my weight... No problem. Draw it out longer. Thanks for taking the time. You can see we've done a lot of movies. We've plans to shoot 12 this year. One with Zi Yi Zhang, another Andy Lau. Many superstars will make appearances. Giving you support. We'll keep in touch. We have to go. We'll call you. You believe that son of a bitch? What bullshit. Who asked you to touch my stuff? The ball fell off. I didn't break it. Don't ever lay a finger on my things from now on. Master, why hide it in the cabinet? That's where it lives. It has no intention of moving out. You work well together. One job after another. Whatever you're teaching her, put your heart into it. Don't let her talents go to waste. I never intended to let anyone's talent go to waste. It's one thing to set standards high. Sometimes people's feelings should also be concerned. Is that right? This type's in vogue nowadays? Need I explain? You're totally out of fashion. I'm so out I can't see what's in. I see fortune smiling on you though. She's more in demand than me. You jerk! Having fun being kept by a woman? Go to hell! She's just a pupil. I'm her manager. Understand? Man... a... ger! Master, how about this one? Sure, it's only $400,000. Manager can afford it. Easy for you to say. Functional, economical - that's our goal. Aren't you basking under Good Fortune's smile? Without prudent investments, how can superstars emerge? Fine. I'll steer it away, we'll talk money later. How about you steer me? For $400,000 I'll let you steer me. Better you steer me for $400,000. Steer me! $400,000! Tonight's the premiere for "One Night in Mongkok". What about it? The film where I was chased and tripped. I fell over and over. How can I miss it? They don't sell tickets for premieres. Ask your friends. Ask the director if he has tickets. Manager, she can't afford to miss it. Pupil needs to hone her skills. After all that fun sprawling over and over. Come on, see how well she sprawls. Master, please. Let's go see it. Wait for the release of the DVD. Forget him. I'll treat you. Let's buy a pirate copy and I'll watch it with you. You and master are such good chums! I'll buy a pirate copy tonight and I'll watch it WITHOUT you. Cut! Good take. Fine. Mark it! Director, what's the next shot? Close-up. Which direction? What size? Camera over there. Faye... for this shot... we're going to do a close-up of you turning. Understand? You've just had an encounter... with the man you used to love. He's with his wife and kid. It's emotionally wrenching. Hold the tears until you turn to look. Try and feel the emotions. As the camera tracks in close, turn and start crying. Can we try it? Back to the positions. Ready to shoot. Cut. I think she needs medicated oil. Medicated oil, please. Excuse me. Give us a minute. Here's the oil. Remember what I've told you... about finding the truth of the moment? Do you believe in love everlasting? I believe in it. When Mom died, my parents had been married 20 years. Dad made chicken soup every day for her. He didn't really know how to cook. Only learnt how from the neighbors. Rain or shine, one chicken every day. From the moment Mom fell ill. Chicken soup every day without fail. Are there people who cared for you as much? Granny doted on me. My grandparents adored me when I was a kid. After Mom died they continued... to cook a feast for me every day. It was unbearable. Choking the food down, feigning enjoyment. Emotionally, I was devastated. Can't bear to face those... who cares for me so much. Telling her I wasn't feeling well, I'd go back to bed and for them to watch TV outside... My emotions uncontrollable, the moment I turn my back I was overwhelmed. I rushed to my room, streaming with tears. I didn't dare make a sound. Bear this feeling in mind. It's the truth of the moment. Faye, finally! Nice to see you also. Sit over here. Sit. How about some red wine? Fine. Take care of them. Let me introduce you to a friend? Sure. Told you not to bring your manager. Doesn't matter. Come. You lose. Drink up. Marco. This is THE Top Manager, Marco. Faye. Take a seat. Sit. Where're you from? Hang Zhou. You speak Cantonese well. Cheers. Pretty girl. Can you sing? A bit. Let's hear you sing. Great. Sounds pretty good. She has talent. Didn't you mention she has a manager? Sure. He's here. You want to meet him? Marco, Marco... Poon Kar Fai. Have a seat. I'll leave you to it. You're Faye's manager? What of it? I'm forming a girls band with 7 singers. I want to sign Faye. She a songstress? Even if she's totally tone deaf, I can guarantee her concerts will be sold out. I'll sign you up also. As a singer? As her caretaker. Name a price. I want to buy her out. Not everyone has a price. What the...? Excuse me. Carry on. Let's go. Faye. Felt her up enough? Stick this up yours. What's the outburst about? Showbiz is complicated. You must be careful. We're friends. Just fooling around. Of course he wants to fool around with you. Think he wants to commit to a long term relationship? I saw you talking to Marco. What're you talking about? Crap. What crap? He wants to sign you up for a girls band. For real? So what did you say? He was drunk and incoherent. Then let's get back and talk to him. Or set up an appointment. I turned him down. Are you insane? Can't you ask my opinion first? Isn't it up to me to make these decisions? You're forever turning things down for me. I shouldn't do this series. That film's not good. All these lost opportunities. What opportunities? A gaggle of drunken nymphets, lolling around aimlessly. This a singer and that's a pop star... says who? You want to be famous? Learn one thing well. Focus on acting first. Fine! Fine! I can't go to this premiere. This movie's not allowed. And it's forbidden to sign with Marco. Why have acting skills if it can't be put to use? Do your own negotiations! See how many pitfalls you'll come against! I'm not afraid to make mistakes. It's not just fame I'm after. I'm young. I see opportunities everywhere. I don't intend to let a single one escape me. I don't want to be like you. Waiting impotently for chances to happen to you! Ready to take flight. What are you doing? I'm leaving. Why? Master, you came back in time. Can I have your scarf as a memento? Remember that day... On the set of "Brilliant Love"? How memorably you taught me to act? You were so patient, so caring. I will never forget it. Don't be like this. What's wrong? I've made my mind up. I didn't sleep a wink all night. I finally realized acting is not suitable for me. Honestly, you're talented. Having talent doesn't mean anything. You're talented too. But master, I'm still grateful to you. You've taught me so much. Some day I'll repay you. Goodbye, master. This... is for you. It's the poster you did with the Grasshoppers. It's beautifully shot. Come on. I'm always foul tempered. I scold you... because I care about you. I'm a has-been. A failed actor. I don't want you to go astray like me. Don't you understand? Stop crying. Don't be like this. Stop it. Master, was my performance good? You taught me well. You didn't mean to leave. You're pulling your teacher's leg? No... Master, this is so fantastic. Where should we hang this? I think it will look good here. What do you think? Glutinous rice balls. Something to say? Do you know the director, Gordon Chan? Sure. Really? You know each other? I know who he is but he doesn't know me. Is he a good director? Among the best in Hong Kong. He asked you to audition? He's making a movie in Japan. They're looking for a suitable leading lady. I want to give it a try. Filming in Japan... and the lead actress. You think you'd stand a chance? It's not a role suitable for everyone. Nudity? Didn't you say he's a good director? So what? You want to strip top and bottom for his sake? I think it's a wonderful opportunity. Can't you take me to the audition? See if it is as you imagine. The nudity may not be daring at all. Fine. Don't regret it. The story happens in Japan. She's an innocent at heart. She encounters numerous obstacles, She even has to betray her own body. But she's forever optimistic. Searching for true love. Not matter how she suffers, she remains faithful to her ideals. Our theme revolves around love and sex. Inevitably... all the actors, both male and female, have scenes of nudity. We don't want girls simply willing to bare breasts. I'm seeking actresses... who truly know how to act. But who doesn't mind the nudity. Do you think you have the mindset? I think I can empathize with the main character. I have no problem. Can you put your hands down please? I wonder... Is it cold in Japan now? You're really serious about this film? First scene, initial encounter with the leading man. Two words and you start peeling clothes. Next. The two of you driving to the restaurant. Suddenly he stops the car. You have torrid sex roadside. Can you dig that? This description is priceless. Let loose from conventional morality, they surrendered to unbridled sensual desires. Whoever wrote that should be smacked. Porn, pure and simple. The director said he aims to do an art film. Also I think the storyline is plausible. The film will be submitted to major film festivals. It's so much hot air. Who can guarantee it will work out? If it fails, you'll just be another porn star. A label you'll forever be branded with. What will you do then? I truly find the script touching. I can respond to it emotionally. I want to accept the role. OK? Master, so far you've made all the decisions for me. This time... I want to think for myself. Is that alright? In that case... Let Fate decide it. Fair enough? Tail says no nudity. Wait... Heads says no nudity. OK. Don't toss before I confirm it! You say. Tail yes... heads no. Your mind made up? Yes... Which side up? OK. That's it. Last call. For sure. Ready? OK. Show it to the director. Director, I feel that, a shorter length will be more effective. What do you think? Do you agree? We can try it. Is that OK? Short looks better. Adjust it. I'll see to it. How does it look? Hitched up to here. So eager to get naked? No one asked you to expose yourself to that extent. Think I'm an exhibitionist? I'm just doing what's best for my role. You taught me it's vital to remain true to character. Of course! The Key to Great Acting! Should I be playing sexy wearing long johns? Wearing long johns to play sexy, that'll really hone your acting skills. A real challenge. Fine. When we're on the set... you'll wear the long johns and show me how. What set? What? Aren't you coming with us? I wasn't asked to. That's impossible. Excuse me, why isn't Fai coming with me? We have limited budget. Fai understands. If you want him on the set, you'll have to pay your own way there. The money can be deducted from my paycheck. If you're not there, I'm hopeless. If I'm not present, you don't know how to act? You can instruct me to do better. As your teacher, I've taught you... everything I know. Fend for yourself from now on. As your manager... I've read and negotiated your contract. If you want me as your nursemaid, you'd better off hiring an assistant. I can't go. How can I bear watching you... with other men? Playing torrid love scenes? It's impossible for me. It's beyond my acting capability. I know. I just want you by my side. Anything wrong with that? 2 dozen, please. OK. It's 2 dozen instant noodles. Half dozen each of dried dace and spicy pork. 1 dozen chrysanthemum tea. Are you stocking up? Are we at war? Invading Japan. I have atomic bombs. Need some? How about missiles? These skincare... suitable for sensitive skin. I was told this sunscreen is the best. Also... This'll keep you warm in the ice and snow. But Made in Japan! These are first aid. Most important. Shooting love scenes, give him one to chew, chew one yourself. Remember, whatever you decide to do... do the best you can. Nothing else matters. That's how an actress should be. This spray is marvelous. If you're injured. To disinfect wounds. Clean it, then spray. It provides a protective layer. Eye drops. For when the tears can't pour... We're late. Phone, phone... Damn it. Coming right down. Don't panic if you're faced with any problems. Calmly analyze it. Or talk to the director. Don't ever quarrel with director. If you are at odds with him even if you give a great performance, he can still cut out all your best scenes. As an actress, don't be conspicuous. Don't be a chatterbox, The less you blabber about the more they think you a woman of substance. Watch what you eat. Disastrous if your belly sticks out more than your tits. Get in the car. Hurry. Good girl. You have your passport? Careful crossing the road in Japan. Go! Go! Remember this moment. It'll be useful. We have a plane to catch. Don't go roaming round by yourself. It's unfamiliar territory over there. I'll make you proud of me! Be terrific! Think you're scrubbing the sink? Polish the wax in circular motion. Use the wrist. Take your time. You're in the way. Yes, master! Stop right there! I don't take pupils. Not stupid like you. Duped by a woman. What do you mean duped? She used you to boost up the ladder of success. Now she's a leading lady in Japan. Once she's picked your brains, you're out of the picture. What? Wai. There are zilch acting jobs for me. I'm trying to learn a craft here. I beg you. Deliver me from my sorry plight! Have pity on me. Want to quit showbiz? Try the Buzz Lightyear impersonation at Disneyland. You look just like him. Aren't you one to give encouragement! Quit? You're born to do showbiz. What else are you good at? In acting school you're already a fanatic. Tailing cops to observe how to act like one. End up being hauled to jail. I wasn't hauled. No, never. That was method acting. Method acting my foot. I was first in acting school. I was raring to blaze my way into showbiz. A star overnight. Best Actor three years straight. Even waxing, I tried to explore psychological truths. What psychology is there to waxing? There's only technique. One polish won't make it shine. You have to polish again and again. Mom, where's Dad? He sprained his leg gardening. Don't want him running around. Where's Faye? She left. She left you? She's in Japan filming. Shall I cook noodles? Let's eat out. If you have time let's visit grandma's grave. It's been a long time since you've paid your respects. Mom, you think I made a mistake being an actor? I've never asked your opinion, have I? Put it this way. Ask me if I made a mistake marrying your dad. What's done is done. There shouldn't be regrets. It's important to do well what's expected. Your conscience clear when you're past your prime. Am I right? Aren't we eating out? Go change. Tony, weren't you going to change cars? I'm attached to it. What're you doing here? Enhancing your value? I've also applied to be a domestic help. Paint your face black and pass as a Filipina. I'll pay you domestic wage - $3,320 per month. How else get rich. So unscrupulous... Check the carburetor for me. It's rattling. No problem. I thought you were doing a series in China. Who'd want me? You're hiding here waxing. Who's able to find you? Nobody's looking even if I'm not waxing. You think I'm an Award-winning star? Award-winning is not the same as "sought after". After years of ups and downs, I've become philosophical. Sometimes it's not just the luck. You're telling me to work hard? If I hadn't been pedaling and pushing so desperately... think I could still keep my head up high? Easier said than done. What kind of attitude is that? You're quitting even before you started. Whatever you do, put your heart into it. Sooner or later someone's bound to notice. Ray, yes... This is Poon Kar Fai. Yeung? Poon Kar Fai here. No problem. A walk-on will be fine. Call me. Good. See you. Survival in this business means being persistent. Hanging on kicking and screaming shamelessly? That's it. Even if everyone's advising you to abandon ship, you must stick with it. As long as you're breathing you'd still stand a chance. You were good. Pity we ran out of film in the middle. Doesn't matter... Sorry. We'll do another take. This time I won't keep as close to you. OK, no problem. Tape my mouth shut. This is my resume. Most of the shows I've done. Talk about yourself. Why do you like to act? I don't know why I like acting. My genes maybe. But now, acting is everything to me. It's my self-esteem, my achievement. The only thing I'm good at. I know why I'm a better actor than most. Because I don't accept being the same level as them. Regardless of whether my performance is poor or not. I'm still unique. I despise those who claim to be actors... but just witlessly go through the motions. I don't like to beg. Not now and never will. I'm not asking for sympathy. If I'm given a part because I'm pitied, than I'd rather refuse it. If I had to choose, I'd rather die. I want to continue acting... because I need to answer to myself. I have to convince myself I'm right all along. Since I was a child I've always believed in myself. I composed this spiel in the car... on my way here. Mark it... Cut! Mark it! Director, it that OK? Fine. Can we break for dinner? OK. Fai, dinner? No, thanks. When did you leave the TV studio? Not long after you left. Disenchanted by my outbursts? I hated you when you screamed at me. But when I saw you act, I forgave you everything. It's for you. I've quit smoking. Also drinking less. Thanks. After a few months you're a different person! When are you leaving? Tomorrow morning. So soon? The director wants me to arrive in Beijing earlier. I need martial training for 3 months before they shoot. I'll be gone 9 months. It'll flash by. Treasure this chance of a lifetime. I know. You too. What time will you get back? Don't know. Maybe 2 or 3 A.M. I'll wait for you at home. Back on set! Get to work. I'll look around by myself.. I have lots to talk to you about. Let me explain the next scene. Camera starts from Dan's side. Then it tracks round when he says his lines. He suspects there's an informer. You're a bit stunned... thinking he's talking about you. So should I... feign calmness or act nervous? I think... you'd tense up, then try to cover it. We've botched up because there's a snitch. NG... What's up? Isn't it better to have the girl... being shoved and falling down? Cut! When you grab his hand, use your other arm to strangle him. We'll lower the camera. That side's better. Push then grab like this... the goon behind you will struggle with you. You grab him with this hand. The camera will pan down to the gun... In the scuffle the gun drops. The camera pans down and you kick it away. Action! You betrayed me? OK? Cut... Are you OK? Get someone to give it a shove. Move faster so Scar can get into position... to push the barrels. Almost. Not enough force. Scar was too slow. I was waiting around here... for him to catch me. In this next scene... after I'm shot in the back and looking at Jo. I'd take the ring out. Is it possible that I'll stumble over... I'll come as close as I can, she points the gun. She shoots, then I show her the ring. Not a bad idea. See if you like this... I want to set off the charges myself. What I want to do is... Seeing she's prepared to fire, I'd just stand here and let her shoot me. I don't think I can react fast enough. Let me set it off. It'll looks more unexpected. Faye. I've taken the smell of you with me. It'll give me warmth. Fai, I'm leaving. After completing Mr. Chang's movie, I'm going to Japan to further my career. No matter what, I'll always remember you. You will always... always... be the best actor in my mind. Thank you... Time for your medicine. Stop drinking now. Quit moving around. Sit still. Hasn't started yet. So crowded. Can't even see him. We'll see him when he wins. Win what? Shut up. Just watch TV. Kar Fai, this side... Smile. One more photo... You're nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Are you confident? I wouldn't be here... if I didn't think I'd have a chance. We think you performed better than the lead actor. What do you think? No. I... I just did my best. I think you should be Best Actor. Next year. Better chance next year. How does it feel walking down the red carpet? It was exhilarating. Very special. If you win, who will you celebrate with? How about with you!? Thanks. Have to go. Everyone pretending to be calm, pretending not to care. Tonight we're honored to have with us... Faye Ng who's making a splash in Japan... in the hit movie "Beautiful Times", to present the Best Supporting Actor. Please welcome, Faye Ng. Fai. Use it to wipe sweat or anything else. Keep it handy. Are you toying with me? Take it. Good evening. To be invited to present this award for Best Supporting Actor, I am honored and excited. Maybe you're not aware that... before I did "Beautiful Times", I was just another extra. But I was fortunate. I met a teacher and good friend. He taught me acting, and recognizing the truth of the moment in life. He stressed that in real life... there's no such thing as Main and Supporting. Therefore every role, no matter how minor, you should treat like a leading role. Pour your heart into it. The 5 nominees in the audience... must be nervous. Without much further ado, please look at the large screen. The nominees of the Best Supporting Actor of... the 25th Hong Kong Film Awards are... Jack Chan for "Endless Love", Choi Fai for "The Last Assault", You're not like the others. Stay calm. It should be your turn. Warner Lam for "Invincible". I now announce that... the Best Supporting Actor... of the 25th Hong Kong Film Awards is... No matter what you think of me, good or bad, I'd still go all out for my every effort. Pretending it's right when it's not, turning a blind eye I can't do that. Not then, not now. Never in future. Regardless of what you think of my ability... I know I'm good.
