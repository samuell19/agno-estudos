That's what Mister tells me. We live by his rules or we die. Or worse. We die and we come back. [Gun shots] [Vamp screaming] But let's begin at the beginning. I was like any other kid, I had a family. I went to school, I didn't believe in the boogey man. But then the world woke up to a nightmare. [Thunder cracks] - [Radio]... Stay in your homes and not to travel by night. Route 422... - Maybe we should wait. - We'll take the back roads, you'll be safer there.

[Vamp growling] - [V/O] Months passed in a blur of days and nights. We traveled east and west, but always north. Away from death. We avoided the cities. Mister said they were the worst, hit the hardest in the beginning. As people flocked together for safety, the plague marched through their locked gates and they became death traps. When Washington fell, it was over for America as we knew her. As government blew away, our great leaders ran for it. And hope was abandoned. We were on our own now. Me and Mister. Traveling through a ruined land. Pockets of civilization survived. Towns locked down behind fences and guns holding the night away. Cults spread like wildfire across the southern states. Waitin' for the messiah, but he never came. [Distant screams] Death came instead. And it came with teeth. [Soft piano music] ♪♪ - Dumb fuck got himself trapped. Burnt up in the sun. Berserker.

Uh, Mister says less population, less bloodsuckers. - Wait, wait, wait... Not New Eden right? We had a fella, he came through here, and he said there's nothing there, there's no food at all. He said it's not the Vamps ya need to worry about... it's the cannibals. - Thanks. [Crowd in the bar talking] - [V/O] Sometimes I think I could stay in a place like this. Make friends, live in the daylight. Just be a kid. But the truth is I don't feel safe around people. They can think what they want but New Eden was real. It was the answer to all of this and we were gonna find it. Fight our way north, make the open territories. Like Mister says. 'Live free or die tryin'. Fuck the cannibals. - What's her name? - I didn't ask. - [Radio] Why did this happen? How can God let this happen? How can this be his love...

Dead wrong. [Crying continues] - My name is Jebedia Loven. And you killed two of my men. In cold blood. Staked one in the back. He was my son. My own boy. He was only sixteen. He cried for his mother for three hours before he died. God rest his soul. Now you a fine lookin' young buck. That's your father? - My father's dead. - Oh, don't you worry. We'll get you some religion. Bring you to God and the right way. Good stock. You'll still serve. As for you, Mister. Oh, yeah. We know who you are. You kill them that come back, them that serve us, them that God brought down to do his work. Leavin' us to purify the blood of our fathers. And when that day comes, he will bring them back in peace and purity will reign on the earth. Forever!

You can run if you want to. Ain't nothing out there but sundown and them. You won't get far. - [V/O] Mister taught me how to read the stars. I could make my way back to the car, get the weapons, find them robe-wearin' crazies and send them back to that God they kept talking about. I had to keep movin'. Had to make the car before night came. Mister was gone. And out here alone I didn't stand a chance. [Vamp growling] [Vamp screaming] - Shh. - How many of them things out there?
