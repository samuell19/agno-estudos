Let's pray that peace be now restored to the world and that God will preserve it always. Four tragic years of fighting in Europe and in the Pacific are at long last over. World War II now enters the pages of the history books, and America celebrates as eight and a half million men and women return home, get out of uniform and resume their civilian lives. They will find a nation irvocably changed. Our strength and resources are no longer dedicated to the armaments of war. The assembly lines that turned out guns and tanks are once again providing for the pleasures of peacetime living. The veteran will face his biggest problems in his hometown, and it is there they must be solved. No one knows what the future will bring, but for now, it is time to enjoy the victory. Time for this nation to get back to work in a world at peace. Time to look forward to the best years of our lives. You ram it. The flight for Denver, San Francisco and Seattle has been cancelled until further notice. You got anything for Detroit, Sergeant? No, not yet. Hey, Will. Fred. What are you doing here? I thought you'd be home by now. Well, I'm trying to, but old Snafu Airlines here ain't giving me much help. You want to go to Cleveland, Captain? I got a plane leaving right now, Will's. From Detroit? Nothing going to Detroit. Cleveland, I'll take it. It's a lot closer than here. You better hurry. If you ever come to Boone City, you look me, huh? We'll do. Thanks. Right. Well, good luck. Hey, Serge, what are the chances of ride to Boon City? Nothing right now, sir. Fill this out. I'll call you when something comes up. Thanks, Sergeant. Terry captain. Fred terry. Joe. Coming. Parish. Omer. Parish here. Terry yeah, parish got a B 25 going to Boone City. She's making quite a few stops, but you'll get there by tomorrow afternoon. That's well, sure is. It's great to be going home again. Here you are, sailor. I'll do that for you. What's the matter, Serge? Think I can't spell my own name? Well, I thought sergeant. Thanks. Where are you living? Boone on riverdale. Know where Jackson High is? Yeah, sure. Just a couple of blocks past. Oh, yeah. Hi, Sergeant. Fred Derry. Al Stevenson. How are you? Al? This is Homer. Homer Parish. Glad to see you, Homer. Same here. You from Boone, too? Yeah. How long since you've been home? A couple of centuries. Wow. They're doing this time of night. They're getting drunk. They have any sense. Cigarette? Yeah, thanks. Homerstitious. Not me. Me. Me neither. Well, I am. You're pretty good. You ought to see me open a bottle of beer. You got nothing to worry about, Omer. Thanks. Well, I guess we all saw our share of, huh? Not like you fellas. I was always blowdeck in the machine shop. That's where I was when we were hit. I came to on the hospital ship and my hands were off. After that, I had it easy. Easy? Yeah. They took care of me fine. Trained me how to use these things. I can dial a phone, drive a car. I can even put a nickel in the jukebox. I'm all right, but what? I got a girl. She know what happened. Sure, they all do. But she doesn't know what these things look like. Wilma, she's a swell girl. Say, Al, remember how it felt when you first went overseas? I feel that way now. I know what you mean. Nervous, out of the service. I guess the only thing that worries me is everybody's going to try to rehabilitate me. Well, all I want is a good job. Little house for me and my wife. Just give me that, and I am rehabilitated. You married, Al? 20 years. 20 years. Marie and I had ten days before I went over. I met her on my last leave. Now you'll have a chance to get acquainted. Yeah. Wonder how Homer will make out with that girl of his. Wilma. I just hope Wilma is a swell girl. Hey, what happened to the airplane factory? They're making tractors now. There's jackson high. It's your school homer. Wish I had a buck for every time I threw a pass in that stadium. Hey there's Butch's Place. What about that? Butch got himself a neon sign. You ever been to Butch's? No, he's my uncle. Best joint in town now. We'll get together there for a drink one of these days. Right, Al? Sure. Turn east on Riverdale. Okay. Turn left here. This is my street. Just take it easy. Well, Jay, let's all go back to Butch's Place and have a few drinks and then go home. You're home now. Good luck. Homer. It's, Homer. Mom and Daddy. It's Homer. Homer's here. Where? Neck. Hold it a minute. Come on over here. Oh, God, Homer. Homer. So good. You look just great. So good to see you. Hello, Homer. Got to hand it to the Navy. Sure trained him to use those hooks. Train him to put his arms around his girl. Let's go, Trevor. It's all right, mom. Don't cry. Suggest that your mother's. So glad to have you. I'm home. As if we're about to hit a beach. Some barracks. What do you do? Rob banks. That's close. I used to work in one. How much is that? Driver? I got it. Now. Let me get it. Hey, you're outrank. Sergeant. Always all right. Sir. Captain, sir. Good luck to you. Fred. Good to see you again. Where's your mom? She's in back. I'll get her. Who was that at the door, Peggy? Rob. SA. I look terrible. Isn't fair of you busting in here like this. I called you from portman. Yes, but you said you wouldn't be home for dinner. That's Duncan. He's the latest addition to the family. Daddy. Hey, there's my it. Who are you? I'm her husband? Yeah. Would you mind letting me in her apartment? Nobody gets in her apartment but her. Hey, I've come 2000 miles. I just got discharged. I haven't slept in three nights. Let me in. You glamour boys give me a pain ordering people around. The war is over, Mac. From now on, that uniform and $0.05 will get your cup of coffee. You can wait out there's. You have no idea how good it is to have a home cooked meal again. I know how good it is to be able to cook for you again. Finish my homework. Good night, Mark. Good night, Rock. Good night. Boy. Late, dad. Rob. Come here, son. Now, listen. I know you're a big boy now, but not so big you can't give your old man a kiss good night. You understand? Good night, fellow. I'll see you in the morning. Right. Dad. Robbie. And my little girl. I hardly recognize you. What in the world happened to you two? Just a few years of normal growth. Don't you approve? I don't know yet. I guess I need a little time to get to know you again. I'm going to bed, too. What? Sorely? Yeah, I'm a working girl for a couple of weeks. Night, mom. Good night, darling. Don't worry, dad. We'll all get back to normal in no time. I know. Good night, darling. See you in the morning. Well, what do you think of the children? I don't know. They've just gone so old. I tried to stop them, but they got away from me. Cigarette? I don't smoke it. Darling, why don't you sit down and relax? No, I'm relaxed standing up. Listen, is there a drink in this house? I'll see. You know, mom, we haven't got enough eggs for Dad's breakfast. I'll go out first thing. Is this all the nick? I wish. You'd given us some warning so we could have gotten in some supplies. Don't worry, mom. Listen, I got a great idea. Why don't we go out on the town, three of us? Tonight, right now. Celebrate the old man's homecoming. As I see it, we're headed for bad times in this country. We're in the backwash of the war boom right now, but the tide is running out. Next year we'll see widespread depression and unemployment. Cigar, Homer? Got a cigarette? Thank you. I wish you'd tell us about the Philippines, Homer. Did you meet General MacArthur? No, I'm afraid I didn't. Thanks, Marion. I always thought he was such a handsome man. Oh. Can I help you? No, you just sit right there, Wilma. Thank you. Homer, have you thought anything about getting a job? He just got back, dad. I know, but a few months from now, there won't be the same opportunities. Homer, what would you think about coming to work in my insurance company? I'm a mechanic. Mr. Cameron. I'm sorry, mom. That's perfectly all right, Homer. Won't hurt the carpet a bit. Here. There's another glass. Wilma you hold it for him? No, thanks. If you don't mind, I think I'll just go out and walk around for a while. He still play. Good. And you still got a tin here. Uncle Putch, it's good to see you. It's good to see you. Your friend, the captain told me you were back, but I didn't think I'd see you this soon. Fred. Hey, Fred. Homer. My old shipmate cost the Air Corps. It's starting to float. Give him another. And I'll have a bourbon. You'll have a beer. So he took my advice and came. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. And I like the way Butch plays piano. Well, how am I doing? You're doing fine. Why aren't you at home with both? They went to bed and I wasn't sleepy. But why not go down and see old Uncle Butch? Say, what'd you do with Al? He's home. Hey, pretty snappy place. I don't think we'll see him again. This is the best place we've been to tonight. Old buddies, that's all we need. Homer and I were in the Battle of Linguai and golf together. Of course, we didn't know it at the time. Where's your wife? She wasn't home. I left her a note to meet me here. Well, I just hope we don't get too far ahead of her. Homer. Mere minute. Wilma just called. Wilma? What she want? Why don't you leave and get them all worried? It's nothing. It's just they keep staring at these hooks or else they keep staring away from you mean, whatever they do is wrong? I just want to be treated like everybody else. Pop was cleaning his pipe and suddenly got conscious that he had hands and I didn't. So he stopped cleaning his pipe, tried to hide his hands like he was guilty or something. Well, give him time. You'll catch on. You know, somebody loves me. Sure, somebody loves me. Remember that, too. What was your name again? Peggy. Peggy. Nothing. Really nothing. I gotta go. What? Butch is driving me home. Stop. Come on, Homer. It's time for us to go, too. No. Hey, now, just wait, please. All right, Mrs. Stevenson. Come on, we'll give you left. No, I'm fine. I think we'd better take him home with us, dad. He'll live, but he'll be sorry in the morning. You. Peggy. Peggy. Peggy. I'm not that Peggy. Peggy. Go, this is all wrong. What I had in mind was me dressing you. That was redoubled bourbons a go. I remember when you lie on your back, you snore. You it's. It. Target. We're hit. Fire. She's on fire. Shoots. Get out. Bailout. Gdorsky. Get out. Gdorsky. Get out. Gadorsky. Get out. Get out. Get out. Wake up. Wake up. It's me, Peggy. You're dreaming. Go back to sleep. All right. All right. Okay. It's all righteous. Sam. Hello. Hello. Here, this may help. You're Peggy, aren't you? Yes. Sit down. Pour yourself some coffee if you want. Thanks. Did I get out? Of line last night? Not at all. You were so polite. You were positively insulting. That's good. I see I'm married. I know. Oh, boy, did I get well plastered. You had nothing on my dad. Your dad al. You're Al's daughter. You're finally getting it straight. Ever been married, Peggy? No. Engaged? Not exactly. What's the matter with the guys in this town? I don't know. All the good ones are already taken. Oh, boy. Get back in bed. No, I'm up now. You're being royally treated. Breakfast in bed. All right. Why does this family tolerate that vicious beast Duncan? Duncan isn't vicious. Simply isn't accustomed to seeing a man in my bed. That's reassuring. I think I'll pass on the eggs right now. Just have a little coffee. I seem to recall we have a couple of children. Is that right? That's right. Whatever became of them? Well, Rob's gone to school and Peggy is driving downtown with Fred. Fred? Oh, yeah. He's a great guy, even if he was in the Air Corps. By the way, about that dream last night. I've had it before. Thanks for helping me out and for not mentioning it this morning. See you. Freddie. Marie, you're home. You know, I got your note and I called that bar and it was closed. And I've been so worried about you. Oh, come on in. Let me look at you. Look great. All those ribbons. Missed you so much. So many things have happened. I've got so much to tell you. Where are you? Last night I had to work late at the office. Office? Oh, yes. I've got this terrific new job. I'm working for my caress. A junk man. Oh, wait, let's tell you. Oh, he's doing okay. He's got this incredible idea. But, hey, that can all wait till later, can't it? It sure can. Well, I wonder how old Fred's doing. Fred looks like he can take care of himself. Well, it's not easy. Those Air Corps glamour boys, once they're grounded, now in the infantry, any change has to be an improvement. Hey, will you stop fussing around and come in here and talk to your husband? All right, sergeant. Boy, you got tough. Well, I could sure become a man of leisure with no trouble at all. Oh, that reminds me. Mr. Milton called from the bank several times this week. He wanted to know when you'd be home. He told me how eager they were to have you back. I'm sure he is. What's the matter? Oh, I'm just not sure I can go back to that bank. Certainly not at the same job. A different guy than I was four years ago. I know. I can see that. So much has happened. I guess war took away four years of my life. Four of my best years. Four of our best years. I just I don't want to waste any more time. War has changed this country. I mean, more than people even realize. Things are really going to happen now. I'd like to be in on that. Whatever you want to do. I'm with you, Serge. All the way. Hey, got a great idea. Take a couple days off and we'll go up to Spring Falls. I can't, honey. I have to work. I've already missed half a day. Call him. Say you won't be in. Listen, I'm Mike's executive secretary. He thinks he can't run the place without me. Before the war, my cares didn't even know what a secretary was, let alone have one. Well, things have changed. He's not just a junkman anymore. He has three factories. That's only the beginning. Drive down with me. I have a surprise for you. Kelly has now learned to throw dice using his hooks. So he says he's ready to face the world. Callahan still chases that nurse with the big she's still threatening to loosen the bolts in his wheelchair. Hope all is working out first rate for you. The whole gang says hello. Your pal Jeff. Talk about a wild bunch. You miss them. Well, yeah, but you can't spend your whole life in a rehab board. I got gas at Hang's Garage last week. They asked when you were coming home. You should go see him. Well, when I get the car rigged up so I can drive it, maybe I'll go by. I'll drive you. I wish I could be more help. You're doing fine. Homer, we should talk about us. Give me a little time. I just got back. I know. I'm going out to the garage. Don't worry. I'll get it out first thing tomorrow. Okay. Bye bye. Marie. The Decker call. We can't hold up on that jerk forever. I'll get a hold of him right away. Mike, I'd like you to meet my husband, Captain Fred Darity. I know Fred. He used to watch me and his father shoot craps in the alley behind Dan's Bar a long time ago. Sure was. That's a lot of fruits out here. You did a hell of a job for us over there, Fred. Oh, I'm just glad to be back. Sure you are. You seen Walker around? He's out in the yard. Good to see you, Fred. Not bad for a dumb old junk, huh? Lots of things happening out there. You go out and get yourself a piece of the action. It's a good time for guys from the other side of the tracks, like you and me. Mike, about that job in the new plant that'll be great for Fred. We ain't got no job. Oh, yes, we do. You fired Davis. I hired Ben Spencer's kid yesterday. Mike, I want that job for Fred. Fred wants something better than loading trucks anyway. Don't you, Fred? Call Decker right away. I'll talk to him tonight. Darn it. Don't worry about it. I'll get a good job in no time. It's not that easy to get a good job. Nobody's going to pay you $400 a month to drop bombs. Hey, Marie, come on. I'm sorry. That was supposed to be my surprise. You asked the bond. Get back to work. I'll see you. Sir. Oh, Bob, I have been trying to get a hold of you. Listen, I don't care what the invoice says. We're short. No, I have the figures right here, and they don't match up. Oh, come on in. Come in. Al. Hello, Mr Milton. Wonderful to see how are you? You look good. Same figure that fit you took off a little weight. A little weight? Yeah. But you didn't get too thin like some of the fellows did. It's not good for a banker to look too thin. I don't imagine it feels too good either. Sit down. Like that. Sit down. I'll come right to the point, Al. I'm not going to offer you your old job back. I'm offering you a better one. Vice president in charge of small loans. What do you say about that? Well, vice president I don't really know what to say. Salary of 12,000 a year. It's a fine job, Al. You're the man for it. Mr Milton, I'm not the same man I was four years ago. Now, I intend to approach things much differently. Of course, Al. That's what I'm counting on. Your war experience can be invaluable for the bank. We'll be involved in loans to ex servicemen. We need a man who understands the soldiers'problems as well as the banks. That sounds very interesting. When would I start? As soon as you want. You look over some of these reports and applications. They'll give you the whole picture over the briefcase as a present from the bank. Well, thank you very much. Wimpy. Red, deary. How are you? The name is Henry or Mr. Juergens. You're the manager? Yes. And if you're looking for your old job back, this business has changed hands and we're under no legal obligation to give you back Henry. I don't want my old job back. There is one position I have available as assistant salesman. 32 50 a week. But I'm sure that wouldn't interest you. That's right, it wouldn't. What are they doing here? Are you looking for something? Yes, I'm looking for a perfume called Blue Mist. Well, we don't have that. Are you sure? A friend of ours brought some here this morning. A friend of yours? Yes. Well, we're out of it. Well, thank you. I'll try elsewhere. Of course. Come on, Ellen. Derry. Henry. Too much action? Nah. I was repairing tanks behind the lines. Most action I saw was on the ship coming home. Lost all his back pay at a poker game. Will he back yet? No, he got it at Angio. Damn war. Well, I got to get to work. I got to fix this carb. Let me see that. Needle valve is bent. Have to replace it. Son of a gun. We sure could use you around here. Hey, when are you coming back? To work. Come on, give the guy a chance to get used to things. He just got home. Why don't you help me put this back in? No, I gotta get going. Hey, good to have you back, buddy. Good seeing you, Homer. Come and visit anytime. Those are the first words you spoke to me. Why don't we go somewhere and talk about us? Where was that? Stop teasing. You know where it was. In the elevator. That was the corniest line I'd ever heard. That worked, didn't it? What do you mean? It was two whole days before we got married. You remember the minister? How could I ever forget him? The suit stays all his time. You were the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. Let it ring. I can't. It might be Mike emergency or something. Hello? Mike? No, I don't have them. They must be in the office. Mike, I can't come down. Fred and I are in the middle of having dinner and I've hardly had a chance to see him. Oh, Mike, please. Okay, I'll come down. Let me have an hour so I can finish dinner. Don't worry, I'll be there. Bye. Oh, that's mike. He is such a big baby. We have to go back down to the office. But we still have 45 minutes to Happy Times. Happy times. I tell you, Hank doesn't want me back. I know it. Did he say so? He didn't have to. You mind my watching you work? No, of course not. I wish you'd tell me more what you're thinking. I mean, about us. I feel like we haven't got back together yet. Do you hear me, Homer? I heard you. I need to know, are things still the same? How'd it look to you? I mean, about us. I still love you. Oh, no. It took me an hour to get that in place. I'll get it. No freak. All right, take a good look. You Peggy. What the? I saw you standing in line and told Harriet to send you to me. You work here? Just temporary. Vacations in the summer. The rest of the time I go to college. I was hoping I wouldn't see you here. That didn't come out right. I hoped you would find a job and not have to come here. Things are that, huh? Unless you have some special skills. Why aren't you a machinist? I can place you in a minute. I'll remember that next war. You have a very impressive service rec. The rest isn't much. Although wounded and a great danger to himself Captain Fred Derry pulled the pilot, Major Hector Jordan, back into the damaged aircraft leading to the successful completion. A lot of fancy words. Not to Major Jordan. I'd better move you out, or I'll get yelled at about the job. We'll do our best. I know. Nice to see you, Fred. Thanks, Peggy. Come by the house and say hello. We'd all like that. I will. I see you're in the Navy, Mr. Novak? Yes, sir. Don't sir me. I was a sergeant. And you want to buy a, huh? Yes, sir. I mean, yes. Got my eye on a fine piece of property out near Davis Corners. Quite a family. Wife and four children. Well, what about collateral now? Collateral? Well, the bank needs security for the loan. Have you got any stocks and bonds or real estate? Well, that's the point, Mr. Stevenson. I need the loan so I can get the property. It no collateral that makes it difficult. I'm a good farmer. Even during the war, I kept my hand in growing a little truck garden on every island. My family have always been sharecroppers. I'd like to have a place of my own. Sounds as if you'd like to grow things. Yes, sir. You know, with the food shortage all over the world it seems to me that farming is pretty important work. Don't you think so? Yes, I do. It's not like I'm asking a bank for a handout. The government guarantees loans to us. Now, the government only guarantees half the loan. The other half represents a risk to the bank. Well, I'm about to start a new policy at this bank, Mr. Novak and I'm not sure how they're going to take it. But you'll get your loan. Well, that's just great. Mr. Stevenson, I don't know how to begin to thank you. Try. You look like a good wrist to me. Thank you. God bless you. How do you pronounce this? Rev. Means the dream. Is it really what they say it is? I'm sure it is. Haunting, provocative. No question about. Uh, Derek, your wife called. She can't meet you for lunch. Excellent choice, madam. I'll take care of this customer. Friend, would you take those cartons in the back room, please? Marvelous scent. I have another. A little more expensive, but I think you'll like it. Maggie, behind these boxes. It's me, Fred. This is the first time I've seen you out of uniform. Also now you see the real me. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's about time for lunch. Will you join me, please? All right. It's my lunch break, too. I'll be right back. So your wife works for Mike Harris? Yes. Executive secretary. Keeps her very busy. She had to cancel lunch today. Well, I'm glad she did. She's a remarkable person. That sounds phony, doesn't it? No. You sounded sincere, but surprised. Well, she's very involved in her work. We really haven't had a chance to get to know each other again. You will, I'm sure. It's funny. A lot of things are different than I thought they'd be. Dad's been having trouble adjusting, too. What made us think that once we got back, anything was possible? Anything is possible. I think a person's got to set his sights high even if he doesn't always hit the target. Oh, I had my sightset high. Trouble is, my qualifications were where are your sights set? After I get my degree, I think I'll take advanced training so I can work with children. Your own and others. Where were you three years ago? In high school? I'd better go. I'm parked right around here. It was good seeing you, Peggy. Thanks for listening. I enjoyed it. Thank you for lunch. You're welcome. Say hello to Alan. Your mother come by and do that yourself. I had no right. I'm sorry. I've been thinking about moving to another town. Someplace where I can start fresh. What about Wilma? If I went away, I'd let her be free. I think I'd let Wilma make up her own mind. Got a lot of guts, that girl. Maybe more than you. Have fun feeling sorry for yourself, isn't it? I'm not feeling sorry for myself. Matter of fact will? Yeah? Is that you? Yeah, it's me and my civilian disguise. How about that? What are you doing in Boone City? Business. Me and a couple buddies are onto a very good thing. Surplus stores. The army's got no use for it and civilians want it. So anyway, I'm here lying at the location I always want. No millionaire. Listen, I got a couple of things to do before I leave. Why don't we get together later for a quick? Sure. I'm off at eight. Okay, good. I'll see you there. Roger. Excuse me. I'll take care of this. Thank you. Is there something you wanted? Yes. I need a fountain pen. Yes. I'm sorry, we don't carry them. I think you've made a mistake. I see some right there. I said we don't have it. Just sell me a pin, buddy. Look, I said that we do not have what you want. Have I made myself clear? Yeah, too clear. Well, then you just get out of my store. Don't get any trouble. That's what you think. Get out of my store. I'm sorry you had to lose your job over that mess back then. I've been wanting to do that to Juergens for a long time. What now? I don't know. Look, a Palamine here is salvaged war materials. Uses them for prefab houses. Probably all he could offer you would be heavy labor wrecking home right now that's a lot. He's colored. I don't care if he's green. Call it, then. Thanks. You call him. Let me reach him first. Thanks, Will. Better move now. Are you coming back soon? I hope so. We want to have that store open in a couple of months. See you then. Take care. You too. Hey, Butch, you seen Homer? No, man. How's he doing? Things are tougher than he figured. He's not the only one. You've got to fill it out for each shipment. Otherwise, how are we going to know what our inventory is? Okay, Marie. Sorry. Inventory? Why can't you just go out back and load up? Hi, Marie. Hi, Fred. I think I got a job that's well, doing what? A friend of friends. Making pre fab houses. Just heavy labor to start. Suppose you have to start somewhere. Same kind of job you tried to get me here. You're right. I'm sorry. Let's go out tonight, celebrate. I can't. I tried to call you at the department to tell you I have to go to Chicago for a few days with Mike. We leave this afternoon. Chicago? What's for? It's a business convention. Mike needs me, not only as a secretary, but as a hostess. When he entertains, what else does he need you for? Don't be ridiculous. It's my job. What kind of a job? I don't want to fight with you, Marie. I'm delighted for you to be an executive. And I want a wife, too. Fred. I'm a different person than maybe you thought I was. Paris Enterprises. Hello, Mike. Yes, I have the figures. Can you hold on a second? Fred, I've worked like a dog here. It's about to pay. Okay, okay. Hello, Mike. Yes, I have the figures. Hey, how's my favorite girl? Sounds like you had a good day. Yeah, well, Verne and I are getting on a lot better now. Oh, it's verne now, not Mr. Milton. My lie. We still have our differences, but I think we're on the right track. Hi, honey. Hey, what's the matter? What's this, the end of the world? It's Fred. What about him? We called just now. He asked Peggy for a date. He's a married man, honey. What did you say? I said no. Well, what's the problem? Why the tears? Oh, be quiet. What his voice on the phone. He sounded so alone. Look, will somebody please tell me what's going on here? I think Peggy's in love. Well, that's very romantic. Peggy. How does he feel about you? I think he feels the same. You've been seeing him twice? Oh, it was perfectly respectable. So after two meetings, you've decided you're in love with him. Is that right? After lunch yesterday, he kissed me and I could he kissed you? What about his wife, Peggy? How does she feel about all this? Al, we're going to take care of it. No, I'll take care of it right now. Sit down, Greg. What are you drinking? Beer. Have a beer. And another bourbon and water. What's on your mind, Al? Want to borrow money? Want to ask you a question? Sure. Are you in love with Peggy? I might be. Thanks for the honest answer. You're welcome. What's next? What about your wife? Where does she fit into this romantic situation? That's none of your business. This may sound a little corny to you. It happened to be very fond of Peggy. And you don't want her mixed up with a heel like me. I haven't called you anything yet, but I don't want her involved in any kind of a mess. Are you either? Because I'm quite fond of you, too, believe it or not. Then why don't you let Peggy and me work it out. Not a chance. Now, if you ever see my daughter again, I'm going to break your neck. I'll call Peggy. I won't see her again. Bricks are on me. Hi, Homer. Hi, Wilma. I saw the lights on. I wasn't sleepy. What a nice car. Taking for a ride? Let's drive out to Menton Corners like we used to. Oh, it rides beautifully, Homer. It's a lovely night. Hey, Harold Lincoln finally tore down that old farm. Do you like Ward's place? How do you remember? Used to take me there to get buckwheat. Honey. That was good, honey. Oh, yeah. Homer Paris. Shame on you. Running out of gap. That's the oldest trick in the. Oh, and right near Walker Lane, too. Remember when we went waiting in the creek? I got stuck in the mud. Never forget the look on your face. That mud was cold. Thought I'd be there forever. Homer. It'S just not fair to you. What isn't? I love you, Homer, but what kind. Of life could you have with me? I don't know what it would be like. It won't be easy. I don't expect it to be easy. I just want a chance to try. Wilma, I'm going upstairs to bed. I want you to come with me and see what happens. I've learned to take the harness off. I can wiggle into my pajama top, but I can't button it. I'll do it. I can switch the lights off with my elbow, but then I'm helpless. I can't put my hands on without calling for help. If that door blows shut, I can't get out of this room. Aren't you lucky? What? Aren't you lucky that you'll always have me with you to take care of things like that? You mean you still feel the same? Oh, Homer, I love you. So. You wilman. How's the groom holding up now? Smells can be expected. That's just about it. Once you come in, please go ahead. Oh, it's beautiful. Look at all the lovely gift. Is that Fred I feel? Is that? Yes. Doesn't he look nice? He's the best man you know. May we see the. Is there anything in that bunch? A little something. Excuse me. Hi, Al. Hi, Fred. How are you? Fine. How things going? Oh, been putting in a ten hour day on the salvage crew and going to night school. Well, that's great. Those are lovely. The whole set was meant by the. Men that were where's your wife? I'd like to meet her. She's not here. She's out of town. Business trip. That's great about Omar. Yeah, he's going to be just fine. It's a good beginning for all of us. About that time yeah. You got the ring? Check. You look solid as a rock. Why aren't you nervous? I am. No touch at all. Fall down. She's ready. She's ready. It Sam. Sam. Sam.
