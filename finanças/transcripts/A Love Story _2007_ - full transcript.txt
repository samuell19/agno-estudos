Here, ma'am... Yes, ma'am... Ian doesn't know anything about this. He thinks I'm out of the country. I just want to know why he can't leave you. Time to get up. Yani! -My patients are waiting. -What? Please stay. I canceled my appointments yesterday because I knew you were coming home early. Besides, they're waiting for you at your sister's. -That's enough. -I didn't get enough last night. Look, if you get out of bed now, I promise, you'll sleep all day tomorrow because I'll wear you out later tonight. Really? Come on! -Morning! -Morning, Dad. Sit here. Daddy, it's Ian's birthday. -Daddy, it's Ian's birthday. -Dad... Happy birthday, big bro. Happy birthday. We woke up really early just for you so don't expect a birthday gift. -No problem. -Just kidding. -Happy birthday! -Thank you. Thanks. Why breakfast, big brother? A birthday breakfast is unique! So, Ian... Ana. Could I have some of that? That's Stacey. Your wife's dead, Dad. What are you talking about? Wait a minute. Is Ian awake already? Somebody get him so we can all start eating. Dad... But, Grandpa, Uncle Ian is right here. And then? What happened? I don't know. He found someone younger, sexier, who understood him better. Hell, I don't care. God, I'm crying again. Does he know? That you're pregnant? Doc, excuse me. Mrs. Leuterio is already in the delivery room. -All right. -OK. But you also have to take care of yourself. OK? Friend. I'm sure Auntie Maya is nagging you to go with her to the convention. Am I right? But Ian and I have plans. Ian again. With Ian, it's always "go for the gold," isn't it? -Whatever. -OK. Girlfriend, what else do you need for tonight? Cake. And beer. That's it. Cake and beer? Do they go together? -Do you want candles with that? -I'm running late. And you taught her how to cook. Hey. She's been always been great in the kitchen. -Saved. -Very good answer. Wait, you've made up for that now. You managed to domesticate little miss busy doctor here! There... Ouch! I'm never going to hear the end of this, am I? and steal her away from you. -Just like this... -Yuck! -You can fit us in the frame. -There. Stomach in! There. Breathe. One... Ian, closer. There. One... Just a sec. That's what I've been saying. Much like Goldline does. We can't just do that. If you want prices that low, we have to restructure our budget. -Well? -She's right. -OK? -Promo? Fine. What kind of promo? Make sure that all the documents for Macau are ready. Why don't you just take me with you to Macau? Come on. I'll be your personal assistant. I'm sure you'll like that. And what would you do there? You'd be holed up in the hotel the whole day. Then what? A casino all night? I'm OK with that, so long as everything's charged to your credit card. Very funny. You're hilarious. Yani, please? Come on. I'm beginning to think you don't want to be with me on our first anniversary. But I want to focus on just you and nothing else. I don't want to think about business when we're together. No kidding. Look, I'll make it up to you when I get back. Macau, that's nothing. I'll take you to La Union! La Union? Fine. I'll let this one slide. But promise me that I'll have you all to myself. Wait. Question. Do you already have an anniversary gift for me? Not yet. You have something in mind? So where is this gift you want? Let me give you your gift first. It's beautiful. I don't know how I can top this. Where's this gift you want so badly? Come with me. This. All this. Our kids will have all this as their playground. Everything's here. Fields, mountains... the sea, everything! Cool, don't you think? Ian, you know that we can't have kids, right? OK. But wouldn't you at least want to have a weekend rest house? You already have so many homes to go home to. Do you really need another one? I'm already happy with my house. I don't really need another one. You're happy already. You like the house your ex-husband built for you, the one that's still under both your names. You're happy. Joanna, you close the gate. Don't you come go in? No. I don't want to put your mom and brothers in a foul mood again. All right then. I'll ask Macky to drive me home. Don't go home too late. Don't wait up for me. I'll spend the night at the condo. You think women ever forget their first love? Where did that come from? You and your wife have another argument? Don't tell me you're doubting her. Look, man, you're Ian Montes, Manila's most eligible bachelor before she married you. We were all second-rate compared to you. You can call Ian later. Finish your food first. I told you to stop running around. Look at that, it fell off again. Big brother, do you know what Mother asked us for, for her birthday? She wants her whole kitchen re-modeled. And with new appliances to boot. You should hear what she wanted from us. A new car. How about me? What do you think she'll want from me? Even if she asks it of you, she knows you're not going to give it. Thank you. Is that so? Do you know what Mom wants from me? Oh, Joanna, I give up. You just had to choose another Peter as a replacement. Ian makes me happy. Happy? Weren't you also happy with Peter? We were all happy with Peter. But what did he do? Have you forgotten how much he hurt you? That's ancient history, you know. Do you really have to keep bringing it up? Why wouldn't I? You just never learn! To think you're a doctor. You're supposed to be an intelligent woman. But with that jerk Ian, you're just so stupid! He's just going to hurt you and you know that! Then it's my problem, not yours. What the hell did that bastard feed you? One more. Please bring those to the kitchen. I'll take care of it, ma'am. Put half of the first bag in the fridge, please. I thought you'd never answer your phone. Well, you keep bugging me. I thought you finally took my call because you missed me. Where are you, anyway? Why do you ask? -Are you home already? -Yeah, I am. Where are you? -Here. On the road. -What? Just a sec. Someone's at the door. Where are you? On the road! So? Is this a peace offering? Let's go in. -How was the wedding? -OK. I'm sorry about the fight we had the other day. I'm sorry, too. Let's buy the gift that you want. You like that idea? How's the Queen of the Births? I hope you didn't forget to tell the parents about your best friend. Of course. I finally agreed to buy the farm. I felt guilty. When it comes to Ian, nothing else matters. Right? You know, that's what scares me. I can turn my back on everything else for him. I love him that much. Even if I know... that history could repeat itself. He could leave me. He could cheat on me. Just like Peter did. Hey... -Your hand covered my face! -How about from this angle? Wait. Take a picture of the two of us. -It's our turn. -OK, the two of you... Chocolate cake, Dad. -Big sis? -Yes? Have Ella and Gio become official members of this family? Shush. They're still kids. Gio, Ella, come here and eat. Brother, I just have an observation. Seems like we see our niece's and nephew's boyfriend and girlfriend more often than we see official Montes family members. -Well... -Right, brother? Do you and your wife even see each other? Of course. She's just so busy, you know that. Just like you? Is that why you're always absent at the board meetings? I'm never there because you guys can take care of it by yourselves. Besides, aren't you already training Jason to one day run the company? So, you don't really need me there, right? Son, could you take another seat? That spot is my wife's. Dad... -Steve. -Dad? Can you tell him to move? I want your mom to sit there. Dad, that's Stacey. Your granddaughter. Your wife's dead, Dad. Ian, what if you head our new ICT division? Brother, if Dad were well, he'd tell you that would be a bad decision. Bro, I'm sorry, but I have to agree with Steve here. than an outsider running that subsidiary. Get the driver! Concha! -Big sis. -Daddy. -Daddy... -Ella, get some water. Hello? Rick. He's already in the ICU. Then tomorrow, it will be your turn to watch over Dad with Lyn. Please tell the kids to prepare our things. -I'll go get you a change of clothes. -OK. Ian, could you and your wife watch over Daddy after Rick does? Could you? OK. What if he'd died this afternoon? You know, in Daddy's eyes, I haven't done anything right, anything he could be proud of. I'm sure he's proud of you. I don't know, Joanna. He's forgotten me. He remembers everything, except for me. And he is still looking for his wife. Still. Why is he still looking for her? Why does he keep asking for his wife? She was the one who left. She left my dad. She left us. I was the one who stayed with him. I watched my dad as his world came crashing down. I was the one there with him. Now, he can't remember. I just... He can't... Goodness... Yes. I asked Atty. Franco for this favor. OK, wait for me. I'll wait for you. This will be quick. Right after lunch. -The periodicals? -Just a sec, Doc. I'll get them. Here they are. Joanna? -How's everybody? -Everyone's OK. Mother's been getting sick lately. But I suppose that's part of getting older. But Grandma is as strong as a bull. What about the Villanueva brothers? Do they still hate my guts? I don't think that will ever change. What about you? -I'm always happy, don't you know? -Right. You and Ian, how long have you been together? We're celebrating our first anniversary in a few days, but he has a business trip to Macau. They're putting up an office there. How... are the kids? Andrea is in third grade. Anton is in first grade. Our youngest, Yogo, will be going to school this year. And... Celine? It was tough at first, choosing to come back to the Philippines. I felt that I couldn't raise the kids all by myself in Canada. But it was only now that I worked up the courage to come see you. Joanna... before Celine died, Sorry for all the things we did that hurt you. I'll park that. Ian, can't we just do this some other time? Franco's expecting us. Ian, I'm really exhausted. Babe, this won't take long. Before I go to Macau. Just a sec. I'll just park the car. Maybe we shouldn't buy the farm. What's with the sudden change of heart? Peter showed up at the hospital today. I didn't even know he was in the Philippines. I was shocked. He just wanted to talk. OK. So you guys talked. And then what? Nothing. He just dropped by to say hello. Oh, OK. He just said hello, and you suddenly changed your mind. What? Did he tell you that he's still in love with you? -Does he want you back? -Ian, what are you talking about? What did he promise, to make you-- Nothing! He didn't promise me anything! And even if he had, I have no plans of taking him back. He's always been the issue! He's the reason you don't want to give up this house! He's why you keep making excuses about not wanting to have kids! Joanna, I'm so sick and tired of competing with your past. You don't need to compete with anyone! -That's done. It's over! -Done? Over? How is it over? But now all our plans have changed, everything's been ruined, just because he's back! Son. Do you know the song... -The song... -Didn't your wife leave you? Wasn't she gone for 14 years? How could you just take her back? Because I loved my wife. And I didn't want her to be alone during her last days. You forgave her that quickly, huh? Even I was surprised by how easily I forgave Ana. I guess I was just really happy that she came back. You were so happy you forgot to ask your son if he was OK with that. His mom came home. Why wouldn't he be OK with it? I will never understand that. Never. He's just trying to cool his head. And you calling him every chance you get is not helping. What if I just go to Macau? Hello. Are you crazy? Before all this, he didn't want to take you to Macau. You think he wants to see you now? Crazy woman! -So, what should I do? Tell me. -Nothing. You going to do nothing. You're insane, you know that? If "yes," yes. If "no," then no! I'm being careful. Nice. Hey. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on. You can do it, girl. I was expecting you to put down the phone. But that's not what you did. Why? When I first saw the two of you, I knew right away who you were. That I wouldn't feel anything. I was wrong. That's why I'm here. How did you meet Ian? In Macau. It was his first trip to Macau. I'm so excited, gosh. Please tell Atty. Franco to go over the contracts. You're my friend, but sorry, I never really liked that controlling boyfriend of yours! I can't... -Ex-boyfriend. -I can't hear you. -That's in the past. -Ex-boyfriend, yeah. All this time, I thought -your ex was so broad-minded. -About Bohol... -Everything's good in Bohol? -I know. I didn't think he'd be more conservative than my grandpa! -Well, not really. -In Bohol! He's not that conservative. -You know. -Naughty. -Hold on. I can't hear you. -Girl, even the holiest of men become sinners with you. Wait, speaking of sin, -I'll call you again later. Bye. -what's our budget for our casino adventure? Budget? There's no such thing. We can walk out of the casino as beggars for all I care! And I have Mommy's credit card. No worries. I like that! I don't think they'll let you into the casino. How old are you anyway, 15, 16, 17? -I am 22. -Do I look like 16? Hurry. I don't want to eat alone. Yeah. No. I had to re-schedule the meeting. I woke up late. I know. That's fine. I'll take care of it. I'll see him tomorrow anyway. Hello? I have to go now. Bye. Was that a real phone call or were you just pretending to talk to someone so you wouldn't look so alone? I remember you telling me that I didn't need to remember you name because there would be no strings attached. So, it seems I'm the reason that you woke up late. So late that you had to cancel a business meeting. -Because of you. -Me again, huh? -Yes, you. -All right. I guess I'll just have to make it up to you. You're not a convicted felon. So, what else should I know? I'm the type who gets bored easily. So you're difficult. No. What I meant is, I know what I want from life. Stuff like that. And I don't like it when a guy forces me to go along with his plans, especially when I don't like those plans. Haven't you ever heard of the word "compromise"? if I really, really love the guy. Has any man been lucky that way? Nope. Why? You wanna try? Can I? You sure? Not afraid to gamble, are we? I wonder if there's anything you wouldn't gamble on. I know. At your age. What the...? Just so you know. Fine. So how many wives and kids do you have? Of course, I'd prefer it if you were unattached. But I'm not judgmental. So you'd be OK if I had a wife? If I really liked you. It's those damn dimples! And if you win again, I'm the prize. -Game. -You're game, huh? I'm back in Manila. Turn on the air conditioner in the condo. Please make sure it's clean. -You got it? -Yup. OK. We just need to go somewhere first. -How could you do it? -Do what? You didn't even think about this. -We both know that... -Ian? Your dad's looking for you. He wants you to stay inside with us. And why didn't you tell me that you could play the piano? Go ahead. It seems you still have a lot more to tell Karyn. You know, I envy you. You're really good at playing the piano. You. And Daddy. I think my father thinks I'm only good at two things. He was so disappointed when I couldn't play in my recital because I fractured my hand. Too bad, right? My loss. I could have given him a moment of pride before he got sick. You know how gorgeous you are when you play the piano? Really? What are you doing? What's-- Again? Yes. I'm going! Hold on! This is Ava. Let's meet up at the bar. -OK. I'll see you later. -Fine. Just put that in the boardroom. Bro! I know you haven't introduced us yet and Concha hates her, but I think I like this Karyn already. Really? So it's OK with you? -OK? Are you kidding? -Really? It seems like she's a good influence on you. After so long, you're back in this office. You're so fit. So, what's your favorite flower? Have you ever seen a lirium? That. That's also Ana's favorite. Ana and I like the same things. Same flowers, same food, same music. Our favorite song is Nonoy Zuniga's... On our anniversary, she always asks our son to play it on the piano. Ian. She says it sounds different if it's someone you love who plays it. I also know someone who plays that song on the piano really well. Who? This guy. Right? Hon, come on. Please play for us. Please? There's too many people here. It's embarrassing. -And I'm not good anyway. -Ian, come on! Could you? Play for us, please? Hon, come on. All questions. Even the answers should be questions. The first one who doesn't speak in question form loses. And what does the loser have to do? Anything the winner wants. Do you love me? Isn't it obvious? Will you miss me when I go? What if you just don't go? Didn't you say you wanted a woman who was independent and ambitious? Didn't I tell you that I'd support whatever you want? Whatever I want? What do you want? Are you ready? Here? Why not? What if someone sees us? What do you mean so what? It'd be embarrassing! Embarrassing? You just lost! You lost! And I won! There's a bit of traffic here in Makati. I'm so glad you're still there. Don't pick me up anymore. Hold on. This won't take long. Oh, no. It's OK. I'm about to board the plane again. Hon, we haven't seen each other in three weeks. You also told me a week ago that you were going on leave for two weeks. So why are you flying off again? Michee got sick. I'm the only one available to take over. Karyn, you hardly have time to rest. I'm flying to Sydney, but I promise, when I get back... Hey, girl. Let's go. -Say goodbye. We're about to board. -Ian? Are you OK? Hold on. -I promise, I'll make it up to you. -Karyn. Hon, sorry. I was in a hurry. So sorry the place is a mess. -Happy birthday, girl. -I missed you! I have gift for you. -I haven't had any sleep yet. -Happy birthday. -Thank you! -How are you? So, what's up with you two? How about you, what's up? Tell me. Girl, eat! -What happened? -Where's your boy anyway? I told him to just meet me here. I'm sure you miss him. You can't imagine. I've been sex-less for a month! Oh, gosh! Want some wine? -I'm famished. -Eat all you want. -You want a long life? Spaghetti! -I want the chicken. -Ava? -There, thank you. Just a sec. -What's up with you two? -Happy anniversary. We've known each other for a year! -OK, where's Karyn? -Over there. Where have you been? I missed you too. -So, friend... -Really? I should be your bridesmaid. You'll never guess who I saw! Pauline! And she's pregnant! Oh, my God! No kidding? Really? Promise. Five months. And twins. -Did you guys know that? -Is that true? What is it about my friends this time? You don't get them? They're noisy? Immature? What I want... What I want is time for just the two of us. You spend so much time at work and with your friends, and I feel like I'm scrambling for leftovers. Ian, you make it sound as if I don't give you time! I mean, look, we're arguing but you're still texting your friends! Why are you being like this? Because you're never around! Our arrangement was that you were going to support my career, and that all you'd ask is that I go home to you. I go home to you, don't I? Do you know how it feels to come home and have no one here? You know, my sister was right. I don't know what I got myself into. I thought you were going to take Karyn. She went off on another flight last night. -Call a doctor! -What happened? -Careful! -Call a doctor! Ian, where does it hurt? My right. Call a doctor! What happened? How long was he in the water? Get some ice. His right leg is fractured. -Do you have a car? -We do. OK. Where else does it hurt? Just my right leg. Let's find a stretcher. -Ouch. -Does it hurt? You're making fun of me. Luckily for Ian, you were there. Unluckily for me, you were there. Had I gone with him to Batangas that day, you wouldn't have become his mistress. I know that. And not once did I entertain the thought, because I love him. I have a lot of pride. I'm not used to begging... especially if I know I didn't do anything wrong. He can't leave you, Joanna. Because if he could have, he would have done that a long time ago. Joanna, I need you to leave him. I'm begging you. I'm pregnant. I don't know what I'll do without Ian. You don't need him. I do. I need Ian. Good evening, ma'am. I'm sure you won't feel so tired after you taste this. How was Macau? The usual. Very young. She told me how she had to beg her husband's mistress to end their affair. The mistress said... The man would have to be the one to decide. The wife asked the mistress... how she could leave the decision up to the man when she had once been a wife left by her husband for someone else. I could have just told her that we were done, that she had nothing to worry about. But now... Now that we're here... -Joanna, I'm leaving Karyn. -Don't. I'll do whatever it takes. But that's it. What? You'll leave Karyn, and then you'll marry me? And then? You'll do to me what you did to her. What Peter did to hurt me. You'll just leave me. You said it yourself, that was in the past and what we have is different! I'm not Peter, for God's sake! You don't believe in us! You don't believe in me. From the very beginning, you never trusted me! I do. I love you so much. So, so much. Even if I know it's not right. Even if I know that we shouldn't have gotten into this. But we did! I loved you, Joanna! God, I love you so much! I thought that that would be enough to make you forget about caring if this is right or wrong. Can I talk to Ian? He's not here. What? What? What do you mean he's not with you? If my husband's not with you, then where the hell is my husband, Joanna? He hasn't been home for three days! I keep calling him but his phone is turned off. What the hell should I do, huh? There's a farm in Batangas... Just questions. Even the answers should be questions. The first person who doesn't speak in questions loses. You might win this time. Are you OK? Shouldn't I be asking you that? Should I ask you if you still love me? Why are you here? Do you want me to leave? Why? Are you ready to give up? I don't want to hurt you anymore, Karyn. I win! I'll forget everything, Ian. I don't want to know anything. All I want is another chance, Ian. I beg of you, please. I know that this was all just a game in the beginning. Ian... Even if our three years of marriage wasn't perfect, I love you, Ian. I love you, Ian. I love so much. I need you, Ian. Our baby needs you. Let's start over. Here. I brought your favorite. Kiss-kiss, girl. Auntie Maya is so happy that you'll be joining her for the conference. -My schedule has been freed up. -Really? How are you? Okay? And the truth? The truth. No bull. I feel like... an abandoned wife. I'll order three trucks of beer. We'll celebrate the end of your insanity. Then, we'll call Jen and Tessa. You know those two. They have such huge appetites. They'll eat up everything I brought. Girl, does this look good on me? Can I have this? I now look like a real doctor. Would it look better as a scarf? Hey, bro! This one is for you. Ian picked that flower especially for you. Really? It's beautiful, isn't it? -Thank you, sis. -Ian. Thank you for the gift, son. I've been looking for this species for a long time. You have a new plant to take care of. Won't that tire you out, Dad? All the effort is worth it when a flower is this beautiful. You know, a flower is like a woman. Don't pick her if you'll only ruin her. The moment you pick her, you have to take care of her. Because there will never be another flower like her. Why don't you start reciting that to Karyn's stomach? By the time the baby comes out, he will have memorized it. Karyn, I hope you've reduced your number of flights this year. if you just stay at home with the baby. Big brother, I took a leave of absence. One year and a half. There you go. One more push! Here she comes. I see the head. Here she is. Did my baby enjoy shopping with Mommy? Baby, look at your daddy. He's talking to you like a big person already. Oh, he's already big! Right now, he's around three inches in size. This big. All his organs have started forming. His kidneys? They've already produced urine. Did you know that? Why do you know that? I was doing some research on the Internet in the office. I saw this website for first-time dads. I thought you'd visited an OB/GYN. Have I told you? Told me what? That I've forgiven both of you. A long time ago. -Because of Ian? -No. I forgave you because I saw how happy you were. I didn't want to live my whole life angry. You know, when you left me, I was hurt. But this thing with Ian, it hurts more. It hurts so badly... even if I know I have no right to feel hurt. Sometimes, I have to ask myself, would I be happier if I'd fought for our marriage? Maybe I wouldn't have changed. I might have hurt you again. Roy. He's still dressing up. All right. I'll tell him. Didn't you say you didn't want to know anything? No, it's just that, Roy called and... -Uh-huh. -He just said... You know, if you want to know my full sched, -Sis. -Where have you been? -I was in the neighborhood. -What's this? It's from Camille. Good. We can have that for dessert. -Have dinner with me. I'm cooking. -Here it is, ma'am. -Just put that there. -OK. How is Camille, by the way? Is she still spotting? Not anymore. What's wrong? Did you two have another fight? What the hell is Ian doing outside? My sister's not here. Here. I hope this is clear enough. Here. Macky, I know she's inside. I just want to talk to her. I told you, she's not here. Beat it, man. Macky, I just want to... -Joanna! -What the... I told you, man! Joanna! It's over! Ian. It's late. This is my house. My father's house. I grew up here. Here. What about you? You only came into the picture when you married my sister. If you want to drink, don't do it here. Not in this house. What do you care anyway? What? Why? You never get drunk? You never get drunk because you're goddamn perfect! Alcohol won't solve your problems with your wife. -Alcohol won't solve... -Come on. Let's go. I'll bring you home. Are you deaf? Or are you deaf? Or maybe you have Alzheimer's too. This is my house! My father's house... There's my father! Me, I'm the son! You? He just made you president of the company but not of this family. Then great! Isn't that what you want? Isn't that what you want? I'm a mess! A mess! So you can be the great one! You can be the hero! Isn't that what you want? -Could you help him-- -I don't need your help! Why do like meddling so much, Steve, huh? Ian! Have pity on Daddy! -Ian! Have pity on Daddy! -Let him go. Have pity? Me? Have pity? Don't tell me to have pity on him! I was the one here when Daddy was at his most pitiful! Me! When Mommy left him! Did he notice that? No! Were you here to see that? Any of you? No! Was that appreciated? It's you! Because you're always right! And no matter what I do, I will be nothing compared to you! What's that racket? What's happening? Who is that? What are you doing? Who am I? You don't know me? I'm your doctor! The damn doctor! God, a stranger... I don't wanna lie down. Why are you letting strangers into my bedroom? Where have you been? What happened to you? Can you not talk to me? Because my head hurts. What is that? Do you know what time it is? What happened to you? You went to see her again, didn't you? Are you always going to think that whenever I go home late, huh? You saw her again, huh? You saw her again, didn't you? -I didn't see Joanna! -Liar! Liar! If you don't want to believe me, then don't! That's not true, bro. When Daddy finds out about my mistakes, that's what he'll say. I'm a failure because I didn't love my wife the way he loved Mommy. Daddy will tell me, "You were angry because your mom left. You hated me because I forgave her right away. But you... you not only betrayed your wife, you hurt her too." Rick, I don't want to hurt my wife anymore. But I end up hurting her anyway. I don't want to love Joanna anymore but I still do. I hurt Concha, and then I punched Steve. I don't know what to do anymore. Bro... the important thing here is that Right? But what if I can't fix everything that I've ruined? You have to believe that you can. Bro... Joanna! Karyn? Are you that desperate? I told you to stay away from Ian because we're going to have a baby! -Karyn, let me explain... -The nerve! -Wait. It's over between us... -Bullshit! Do you think I'm stupid? You're messing with the wrong person, you know that? If you think I'm going to let you deprive my child of his father, you're so wrong! Karyn? Let's start her on some... -I don't want to be here! I beg of you! -Then request for a CBC, urinalysis and a pelvic bone ultrasound. -OK? ASAP. -Get me my doctor! I don't want this! -Let me, ma'am... -OK. Karyn... I can't sedate you. Get away from me! Stay away! Karyn, you need to relax. Think of your baby. Don't worry. I won't hurt you. I'm so tired. I don't want to beg anymore. I beg of you. End it. Take pity on my baby. Please. I ended it, Karyn. A long time ago. After you asked me to. I don't love him anymore. Ian. Where were you? Why is it so hard to reach you? I brought my dad to the farm. I'm sorry. My God, Ian. What if something happened to your wife? Have you forgotten that? Ma, cool it. -Hi. Good evening. -Hi. Good evening, Doc. Are you feeling better? Yes, I am. You almost went into a stress-induced premature labor. They said you were hysterical in the ER. Why are you so stressed out, anyway? -Hi. -Hi, Doc. Thank you for this afternoon. How are you? I'm OK now. Thank you. Joanna, it's a good thing you were able to calm her or she might have given birth prematurely. Just the truth, that her husband loves her and that he was on the way. Please make sure you don't stress out your wife before her due date. I have to go. Good night, Doc. -All right. -OK. Maybe I'll be able to discharge you tomorrow. Really, Doc? Ian, she can go home after lunch. Ian, did you hear that? After lunch she can go home. I brought her home already. What happened in the hospital... I need to be OK. So I can do the right thing. It's not easy. It's painful. But not everything that makes us is happy is right, you see? But everything that's right is painful in the beginning. Maybe there will come a time when that right choice will make us happy. Go home. Your wife's waiting for you. Sometimes... I wonder... what if I'd loved you first? But you didn't, Ian. I don't want to be the one you run to because her love seems to be lacking. And I don't want to hurt anyone again. That's why I can't love you anymore. Just questions. The loser has to do whatever... Do you know that I don't regret fighting for you? Because that's when I realized how much I loved you. Karyn, do you know that your efforts have not gone to waste? Do you know that as long as we're together, I'll always be afraid that we'll just end up hurting each other again? Can't we fix this? Karyn, what do I need to do? Karyn. How are you? I'm OK. -What about you? -I'm OK, too. -How's your baby? -Jacob? He's so grown-up. He's in preschool. And Ian? Ian's OK. He's with Jacob right now. It's his birthday, remember? Yeah. Karyn? -Can we sit down for a while? -Sure. I know I hurt you. That's in the past. Does Daddy look cute? Go to Grandpa. Come on. Go to Grandpa. Come on! Ian, what did I tell you about your mom's flowers? This is Daddy. You shouldn't... pick a flower... if you'll just throw her away and ruin her. Here. It's OK. Why do you know that? That's what my dad used to say about marriage. Is that so? But my daddy was one of a kind, especially when it came to love. He loved my mother so much he was able to forgive her in spite of her failings. Do you still hate him? Daddy was right. He told me that I needed to let go of all the anger in my heart so that loving could come more easily. I was so angry and bitter that I ended up hurting my wife... And so many others got hurt as well. But you've changed? You know, if I were your dad, I'll tell you, Then why don't we pretend you're my dad? Wow. Were you able to buy tuna from the market? -Yup. Are you going to marinate it? -Yes. -Is it fresh? -Fresh. And lots of it. Lots? I'm just going to make some tuna ceviche and pasta? But I haven't made it yet. I made pasta. No. I made it for you already. Ouch. Funny combination, don't you think? Pasta and tuna ceviche? -Yes. Because that's how we are. -That's how we are. Perfect.
